Description: Apple launched the iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4 at its annual fall event in Cupertino. The devices come with some big upgrades — a new camera control on the iPhone, a new design on the Watch — but also a lot of promises about AI. Today on the show, we discuss everything that's new, everything that's missing, and all the reasons you might or might not want to upgrade your Apple gear this year.

Speaker 3:  to me that you describe your whole setup right now, both for people who can

12
00:01:24,395 --> 00:01:27,395
Speaker 3:  watch, who would like to know what's happening, and also for people who can't

00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:29,915
Speaker 3:  just paint us a word picture of your current setup. Right now

14
00:01:30,635 --> 00:01:34,395
Speaker 2:  I am in my hotel room in Sunnyvale, California. I just came from Apple

15
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:37,715
Speaker 2:  Park. There's a David's running the show because I have no idea what's going

16
00:01:37,715 --> 00:01:41,515
Speaker 2:  on. I I, I was in Apple's ambient experience.

17
00:01:42,215 --> 00:01:45,355
Speaker 2:  Either you're gonna get a new phone or you're gonna be raptured. That's my

18
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,555
Speaker 2:  experience every time I go to Apple Park, I don't know what's gonna happen.

19
00:01:48,095 --> 00:01:51,155
Speaker 2:  But yeah, I was just at the Apple event with our whole crew, the Allison,

20
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:55,035
Speaker 2:  Chris Welch Veen. We had a great time. We ran around and played a few phones

21
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:59,395
Speaker 2:  and I'm in my hotel room, which I've attempted to turn into a podcast studio.

22
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,115
Speaker 2:  It went six.

23
00:02:04,785 --> 00:02:07,515
Speaker 3:  Okay. What, what's, how's the lamp? Tell us about the lamp.

24
00:02:07,735 --> 00:02:11,635
Speaker 2:  The, the lamp is glued to the table. I'm very late. You know, I'm on the

25
00:02:11,635 --> 00:02:14,395
Speaker 2:  West Coast. Everyone else is on the East coast. 'cause they didn't, they

26
00:02:14,395 --> 00:02:17,555
Speaker 2:  didn't come. They, they abandoned me to Apple. We

27
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:18,235
Speaker 3:  Did. That's

28
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:21,075
Speaker 2:  Correct. So they've been very patient while I tried to figure out how to

29
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:24,595
Speaker 2:  make this room work and the lamp being glued to the table really through

30
00:02:24,715 --> 00:02:27,515
Speaker 2:  a, you know how you like leave a room. You're like, I know what I'm gonna

31
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:30,395
Speaker 2:  do when I get back to that room and you walk back into the room and the lamp

32
00:02:30,395 --> 00:02:34,155
Speaker 2:  is glued to the table. Been there. I dunno, that's been metaphor been there.

33
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:37,035
Speaker 2:  I dunno if that's, that happens to other people. But anyway, I'm back in.

34
00:02:37,035 --> 00:02:39,915
Speaker 2:  It's our room. I just, we, we just played with the phones. I met a bunch

35
00:02:39,915 --> 00:02:43,555
Speaker 2:  of people. I talked to Phil Schiller for five minutes about camera

36
00:02:43,555 --> 00:02:46,795
Speaker 2:  buttons, which is a fascinating conversation. I'm ready to rock.

37
00:02:47,355 --> 00:02:50,635
Speaker 3:  I am very excited because it does feel like a solid two thirds of this episode

38
00:02:50,655 --> 00:02:53,635
Speaker 3:  is gonna be about camera buttons. But let, let's go back to the beginning.

39
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:57,355
Speaker 3:  You were saying, like, before the event even started that

40
00:02:57,615 --> 00:03:01,085
Speaker 3:  the vibe of this event at the Steve Jobs theater was

41
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,805
Speaker 3:  unusual and you've been to a million of these.

42
00:03:05,945 --> 00:03:09,165
Speaker 3:  And so just to hear you be like, this is not how this room normally feels

43
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:11,605
Speaker 3:  is fascinating. So like what, what, what was the room?

44
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:15,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I don't wanna do too much immediate criticism on our show.

45
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:19,445
Speaker 2:  It's not anything criticism, it's just media talking about itself.

46
00:03:19,675 --> 00:03:23,605
Speaker 2:  Sure. But the mix of people in that space was different than before.

47
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,565
Speaker 2:  It was like tangibly different than before. There was a lot more foreign

48
00:03:26,575 --> 00:03:30,365
Speaker 2:  press. There were more TikTok creators call

49
00:03:30,485 --> 00:03:33,845
Speaker 2:  'em. It was just like a different younger, more

50
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:38,525
Speaker 2:  visual video crowd. and it, everyone's just like thrilled.

51
00:03:38,525 --> 00:03:40,765
Speaker 2:  Like I think for a lot of people it was their first time at an Apple event.

52
00:03:41,225 --> 00:03:45,085
Speaker 2:  So you just had this like, surge of enthusiasm and then

53
00:03:45,085 --> 00:03:48,205
Speaker 2:  all the old heads in the corner just like grumbling about how the kids dunno

54
00:03:48,205 --> 00:03:50,285
Speaker 2:  what they're doing with their selfie sticks. And I think that's a healthy,

55
00:03:50,915 --> 00:03:52,045
Speaker 2:  it's like a healthy tension.

56
00:03:52,635 --> 00:03:56,445
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I mean, If, you rewind a decade. It was just like

57
00:03:56,465 --> 00:03:59,525
Speaker 3:  the old heads and Apple employees at those events, right?

58
00:03:59,635 --> 00:04:03,485
Speaker 2:  Well, no, it was like, it was like the legendary print reviewers. Yeah.

59
00:04:03,505 --> 00:04:07,085
Speaker 2:  And me being like, here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take a photo and upload

60
00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:10,365
Speaker 2:  it to the internet right away. And they were like, what are these bloggers

61
00:04:10,365 --> 00:04:11,525
Speaker 2:  doing? Get 'em out my face.

62
00:04:11,845 --> 00:04:14,085
Speaker 3:  It was like, I don't go to print for three days. Yeah.

63
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:18,645
Speaker 2:  Like I appreciate that I'm in this circle of life. But the, the point I kept

64
00:04:18,645 --> 00:04:22,045
Speaker 2:  making in the Lifelog was that the room was super enthusiastic,

65
00:04:22,455 --> 00:04:26,405
Speaker 2:  which we just have not seen in a, in like quite a while. Right. The

66
00:04:26,405 --> 00:04:29,805
Speaker 2:  the, obviously there was Covid and then a bunch of people came back and I

67
00:04:29,805 --> 00:04:33,725
Speaker 2:  think Apple turned over its crowd. I asked a few people it, if it

68
00:04:33,725 --> 00:04:37,605
Speaker 2:  feels like the big change was the dramatic increase in international

69
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:41,165
Speaker 2:  press, that that feels like the big change. I I don't have the numbers. And

70
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:44,605
Speaker 2:  on Apple's data, that just seems like they, they widen the aperture of who

71
00:04:44,605 --> 00:04:48,205
Speaker 2:  was covering the event and they, they had a, a more lively atmosphere.

72
00:04:49,045 --> 00:04:52,845
Speaker 3:  Interesting. I do miss the, the, like, I, I mostly don't miss

73
00:04:52,855 --> 00:04:56,325
Speaker 3:  Apple event days when I'm not at Apple Event days. But there is something

74
00:04:56,325 --> 00:04:59,405
Speaker 3:  kind of lovely about the Steve Jobs theater. Like it's a, it's a, it's a

75
00:04:59,405 --> 00:05:01,565
Speaker 3:  nice place. They did a very good job with the Steve Jobs theater.

76
00:05:01,565 --> 00:05:04,205
Speaker 2:  Good. They did a good job. And then they, they opened a new building for

77
00:05:04,205 --> 00:05:06,925
Speaker 2:  this event called The Observatory, which is just sort of like over the hill

78
00:05:06,985 --> 00:05:10,805
Speaker 2:  and, and, and around the corner. And that's the, their new like

79
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:14,925
Speaker 2:  briefing space. Oh. So they have the Steve Jobs theater was

80
00:05:14,985 --> 00:05:18,325
Speaker 2:  too small the day it opened. They, they've been saying this since literally

81
00:05:18,325 --> 00:05:22,005
Speaker 2:  the day it opened. Like this was too small because they, you know, they designed

82
00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:24,965
Speaker 2:  it in a very different time. It took a long time to build and designed, improved.

83
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:29,725
Speaker 2:  So it's always been too small. And in particular the, the

84
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:33,205
Speaker 2:  sort of spaces within it where You can like, have conversations always too

85
00:05:33,205 --> 00:05:36,045
Speaker 2:  small. So they built an entirely new thing called the Observatory where they

86
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:38,765
Speaker 2:  were having additional meetings and stuff because they have so many more

87
00:05:38,765 --> 00:05:41,805
Speaker 2:  people there now. And the observatory is like this like glass window that

88
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:45,685
Speaker 2:  looks a Apple park. Apple sent some photos to magazine called D Zine Today.

89
00:05:45,785 --> 00:05:48,885
Speaker 2:  We were not allowed to take photos, but You can look at it. It's very cool.

90
00:05:48,885 --> 00:05:52,605
Speaker 2:  And that's sort of their, their their space for after the event. 'cause they

91
00:05:52,605 --> 00:05:54,405
Speaker 2:  have so many more people to talk to.

92
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,310
Speaker 3:  That's cool. There is nothing more Apple E than, look we built, built this

93
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,685
Speaker 3:  very cool building. You are not allowed to photograph. Yeah. Like that's

94
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:02,525
Speaker 3:  it. That's Johnny Ive, the spirit of the man lives on.

95
00:06:03,955 --> 00:06:07,205
Speaker 3:  Alright, let, let's, let's talk about the anthem So I. Think let's do it

96
00:06:07,225 --> 00:06:11,045
Speaker 3:  in reverse order, kind of, of how Apple did it.

97
00:06:11,765 --> 00:06:13,925
Speaker 3:  Just because we, we gotta start with the phones, right? Like the phones is

98
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:17,885
Speaker 3:  the thing. There were watches, there were AirPods and there were phones.

99
00:06:17,895 --> 00:06:21,765
Speaker 3:  Those are the big three. Both of you I believe last week said

100
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:25,365
Speaker 3:  that we weren't gonna get Max congratulations on all of your accomplishments.

101
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:25,805
Speaker 3:  Yes. We

102
00:06:25,805 --> 00:06:27,205
Speaker 2:  Also did not get a TV real. We did

103
00:06:27,205 --> 00:06:30,925
Speaker 3:  Not get a television. No, I was devastated Ted Lasso no appearance. Very

104
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:34,885
Speaker 3:  upsetting. Jason Sudeikis wasn't even there as far as I know. He's just like,

105
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:38,045
Speaker 3:  when shooting lefty threes at WNBA games still, I, when

106
00:06:38,045 --> 00:06:41,365
Speaker 2:  Tim Cook was like, this is some of our most breakthrough and meaningful innovations

107
00:06:41,365 --> 00:06:44,125
Speaker 2:  yet, I was like, oh, they're doing a tv. It was not to be

108
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:47,845
Speaker 3:  No. I'll ask but the phones got bigger, which is we're we're on the way to

109
00:06:47,885 --> 00:06:48,445
Speaker 3:  a television.

110
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:52,725
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. The prize is gigantic. Yeah.

111
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:56,485
Speaker 3:  Yeah. But let's, let's do, let's start with the cheapest phones and then

112
00:06:56,485 --> 00:06:59,965
Speaker 3:  go up to the most expensive phones. Alex, do you just wanna like

113
00:07:00,615 --> 00:07:04,445
Speaker 3:  brief rundown of The iPhone 16 and 16 plus. Yeah. and

114
00:07:04,445 --> 00:07:08,325
Speaker 5:  We can get into it. Yeah. The, iPhone 16 and 16 plus are like good. They're

115
00:07:08,605 --> 00:07:11,525
Speaker 5:  exciting. It's, well, I think, I think the big difference is a lot of the

116
00:07:11,525 --> 00:07:15,285
Speaker 5:  stuff is new on these as well. Specifically the

117
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:18,925
Speaker 5:  camera control all IE camera button,

118
00:07:19,635 --> 00:07:22,685
Speaker 5:  shutter button. Although I think Neil, I probably has some feelings about

119
00:07:22,685 --> 00:07:26,565
Speaker 5:  that. So maybe we don't call it the shutter button, but it, so it's got

120
00:07:26,565 --> 00:07:30,245
Speaker 5:  camera control. It's got an, the action button, which was on the pro

121
00:07:30,555 --> 00:07:34,325
Speaker 5:  last year. It's one to 2000 nets. It's got the

122
00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:38,085
Speaker 5:  ceramic shields. So you should theoretically be able to drop it with minimal

123
00:07:38,155 --> 00:07:41,485
Speaker 5:  scratches. The eight 18 and

124
00:07:41,745 --> 00:07:44,925
Speaker 5:  visual intelligence, which is kind of like Google Ends, but,

125
00:07:45,385 --> 00:07:46,645
Speaker 3:  But Apple did it. Yeah. But

126
00:07:46,645 --> 00:07:50,205
Speaker 5:  Apple did it. and it goes through like the camera control button. And most

127
00:07:50,205 --> 00:07:52,485
Speaker 5:  of the stuff, they really spent most of their time talking about the action

128
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:56,005
Speaker 5:  button and the camera control, which like, as a button lover,

129
00:07:56,525 --> 00:08:00,405
Speaker 5:  I was elated. But other people, I don't know. And it's, it's it,

130
00:08:00,545 --> 00:08:03,765
Speaker 5:  the colors are different this time too, right? Like we got, we got a blue,

131
00:08:03,785 --> 00:08:07,645
Speaker 5:  we got this teal, like bluish teal. We got the pink,

132
00:08:07,785 --> 00:08:10,925
Speaker 5:  we got a purple. It's, it's some lovely colors. This stuff.

133
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:14,445
Speaker 3:  So this is my first question actually. Neela, you've seen these phones. Apple

134
00:08:14,445 --> 00:08:18,125
Speaker 3:  described the colors as I, I believe the quote was more

135
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,525
Speaker 3:  vibrant. Vibrant was a word that was used.

136
00:08:21,745 --> 00:08:22,805
Speaker 5:  Are they thoughts?

137
00:08:22,805 --> 00:08:25,885
Speaker 3:  You've seen these things. Yeah. Some of them, right? What's the They look

138
00:08:25,885 --> 00:08:26,245
Speaker 3:  great. They look,

139
00:08:26,245 --> 00:08:29,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah, they look great. The, the pink is very pink. The blue is very blue.

140
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:33,685
Speaker 2:  Like they are, they are in fact very vibrant. They're very saturated

141
00:08:33,685 --> 00:08:36,645
Speaker 2:  colors. That's exciting. They, they didn't shy away from them. The phones

142
00:08:36,945 --> 00:08:40,765
Speaker 2:  are cool. They, you know, apple continues to sort of round off the corners

143
00:08:40,825 --> 00:08:44,805
Speaker 2:  of the phones. And then as Alex is saying, the

144
00:08:44,905 --> 00:08:48,885
Speaker 2:  big change to the hardware is the camera control button, which is also

145
00:08:48,885 --> 00:08:52,805
Speaker 2:  in the 16. So you don't get the sense the 16 is missing

146
00:08:53,285 --> 00:08:56,285
Speaker 2:  anything this year. Right. There's a, a whole bunch of camera features. It's

147
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,045
Speaker 2:  not getting as a solar processor. Well

148
00:08:58,045 --> 00:09:02,005
Speaker 5:  It's got one less camera, right? They said it could do

149
00:09:02,035 --> 00:09:05,845
Speaker 5:  four, but it's only got, it's got two actual cameras. They got the 48

150
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:10,005
Speaker 5:  megapixel fusion camera and then the 12 megapixel ultra

151
00:09:10,005 --> 00:09:10,245
Speaker 5:  wide,

152
00:09:11,215 --> 00:09:14,805
Speaker 3:  Which is not four cameras. It feels very important to say that's not four

153
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:18,125
Speaker 3:  cameras, that's two, it's not four lenses, it's not four cameras.

154
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:22,485
Speaker 2:  The way Apple would argue this, and I spent, I mean you

155
00:09:22,485 --> 00:09:25,565
Speaker 2:  can't just like throw the words fusion camera at me and not expect me to

156
00:09:26,105 --> 00:09:29,725
Speaker 2:  ask everyone exactly what that means. So fusion camera

157
00:09:29,725 --> 00:09:31,645
Speaker 3:  Wasn't fusion what they called the sweater mode. Tell us

158
00:09:31,645 --> 00:09:32,125
Speaker 5:  About the

159
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,325
Speaker 2:  Tetra. That's pri that's deep

160
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:34,085
Speaker 3:  Fusion. That's deep

161
00:09:34,245 --> 00:09:37,365
Speaker 2:  Fusion. Okay. The Tera Prism is on the pro. So fusion camera

162
00:09:38,005 --> 00:09:41,565
Speaker 2:  specifically refers to the idea that you have a 48 megapixel sensor

163
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:45,485
Speaker 2:  that generally produces 24 megapixel images,

164
00:09:46,105 --> 00:09:49,925
Speaker 2:  but You can run it at 48. And then when you zoom, it doesn't just

165
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:54,205
Speaker 2:  crop the sensor to get you a 12 megapixel zoom lens. It

166
00:09:54,435 --> 00:09:58,135
Speaker 2:  runs an entirely new photo pipeline. So it, they are

167
00:09:58,415 --> 00:10:02,175
Speaker 2:  treating it like you swapped lens sensor, photo pipeline, everything.

168
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:06,415
Speaker 2:  So you've got a 12 megapixel zoom lens sitting inside the

169
00:10:06,415 --> 00:10:10,295
Speaker 2:  48 megapixel main camera. You have to believe

170
00:10:10,295 --> 00:10:13,375
Speaker 2:  all of this is true. That's how you get two lenses.

171
00:10:14,315 --> 00:10:17,575
Speaker 2:  That's the argument. That's why it's called the fusion lens is you have 48

172
00:10:17,715 --> 00:10:20,855
Speaker 2:  and then when you run it as a telephoto, it doesn't just crop the sensor,

173
00:10:21,635 --> 00:10:25,295
Speaker 2:  it does all this other stuff to treat it like it's a different sensor.

174
00:10:26,035 --> 00:10:27,375
Speaker 2:  Do you believe it? That's

175
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:30,935
Speaker 3:  Like me saying. There's me and then there's me with a British accent and

176
00:10:30,935 --> 00:10:33,295
Speaker 3:  that's a whole different guy. Like I just, I don't it.

177
00:10:33,635 --> 00:10:36,375
Speaker 2:  That's Jar. And then, and then the other two, just to be clear, the other

178
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:39,335
Speaker 2:  two is you have the ultra wide and then when you hold it close to something,

179
00:10:39,635 --> 00:10:42,975
Speaker 2:  it switches to macro. So it's a different camera. So you get four

180
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:46,855
Speaker 2:  and that one is slightly more believable in a sense, slightly more believable.

181
00:10:46,885 --> 00:10:49,335
Speaker 2:  That one thing isn't far away and one thing is very close.

182
00:10:50,765 --> 00:10:54,695
Speaker 2:  Sure. But I would, the way to think about it's, it's not four cameras or

183
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,255
Speaker 2:  four lenses. It's four modes. Yeah.

184
00:10:57,255 --> 00:11:00,215
Speaker 3:  Okay. Which is fine. I'm good with that. Four modes I can work with. Lots

185
00:11:00,215 --> 00:11:02,935
Speaker 3:  of cameras have many modes. That seems fine. And I will say all the camera

186
00:11:02,935 --> 00:11:06,615
Speaker 3:  stuff seems solid. Like the, I actually think the, like big

187
00:11:06,615 --> 00:11:10,415
Speaker 3:  improvement to an ultra wide camera is a big deal. And there's been a lot

188
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:14,295
Speaker 3:  of excitement about it. I think I mostly don't shoot with the 0.5

189
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:17,575
Speaker 3:  camera on The iPhone because it makes everything kind of fish eyed and weird

190
00:11:17,575 --> 00:11:21,335
Speaker 3:  looking. Yeah. But there are some like genuinely sincerely cool things You

191
00:11:21,335 --> 00:11:25,215
Speaker 3:  can do with that lens that you can't do otherwise. So if like, if

192
00:11:25,215 --> 00:11:27,215
Speaker 3:  they've made that actually work, I actually think that's pretty exciting.

193
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:27,615
Speaker 3:  So

194
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:31,575
Speaker 5:  This is like real macro mode, right? This isn't just the stuff where I

195
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:35,535
Speaker 5:  would hold the phone up really close and it, if it focused then

196
00:11:35,535 --> 00:11:38,175
Speaker 5:  I'd get a nice shot and call it macro. No,

197
00:11:38,275 --> 00:11:42,095
Speaker 2:  The 13 Pros I think started doing true macro with their ultra wide.

198
00:11:42,475 --> 00:11:46,015
Speaker 2:  And the pros have had it for a while, but now the regular 16 has it. And

199
00:11:46,015 --> 00:11:49,735
Speaker 2:  really what you're seeing is the regular 16, unless you

200
00:11:49,845 --> 00:11:52,975
Speaker 2:  want all these additional photography features, is

201
00:11:53,355 --> 00:11:57,205
Speaker 2:  basically the, the good phone, which is a first. Like I would've never

202
00:11:57,445 --> 00:12:01,285
Speaker 2:  considered buying a regular iPhone before. I've always bought the pros. I'm

203
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:04,845
Speaker 2:  still gonna buy a pro because I'm a huge camera nerd. But there's not

204
00:12:05,035 --> 00:12:08,805
Speaker 2:  some piece of this puzzle where I'm like, oh, that's not good for most people

205
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:12,685
Speaker 2:  like it. This is a great phone. Probably the best straight up iPhone

206
00:12:12,685 --> 00:12:16,205
Speaker 2:  apple's made in quite some time because it is inheriting most of the

207
00:12:16,885 --> 00:12:19,325
Speaker 2:  features of the pro inclu, including the camera control button.

208
00:12:19,415 --> 00:12:23,165
Speaker 3:  Right. And the reason that's happening is a theme we're gonna come back to

209
00:12:23,165 --> 00:12:26,965
Speaker 3:  many times in the course of this episode is ai, right? Like the, the

210
00:12:26,965 --> 00:12:30,605
Speaker 3:  thesis is that these are AI phones. You can shake your head all you want.

211
00:12:30,605 --> 00:12:33,085
Speaker 3:  Neli I'm right, I'm super shaking and we should talk about head about that.

212
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,205
Speaker 3:  But like they, what was Tim Cook's line? Like these are the first devices

213
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,845
Speaker 3:  built from the ground up for Apple Intelligence. Yeah. Like

214
00:12:39,955 --> 00:12:43,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah. That's a British accent. That's it's the same. It's it's

215
00:12:43,785 --> 00:12:46,885
Speaker 2:  it whole. Yeah. They, they started these phones a million years ago. Right?

216
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:50,405
Speaker 2:  Like obviously I think they, they did the action button.

217
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:54,005
Speaker 2:  They knew that the number one thing people would use the action button for

218
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:57,365
Speaker 2:  is the, the camera. They were right. That's the number one thing people used.

219
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:02,365
Speaker 2:  And so they, they added this other button and I, the, the, it's funny,

220
00:13:02,455 --> 00:13:06,045
Speaker 2:  after the event I'm like scrambling to post photos and I had posted

221
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:10,325
Speaker 2:  a thing on threads that I still use the same ancient Nikon camera

222
00:13:10,585 --> 00:13:13,845
Speaker 2:  and lens. And I have been since like the beginning

223
00:13:14,525 --> 00:13:18,125
Speaker 2:  and I'm still using it and the photos are still great. And Phil Siller saw

224
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:21,525
Speaker 2:  me and he was like, that's your old camera, huh? 'cause he, he'd seen my

225
00:13:21,525 --> 00:13:24,765
Speaker 2:  post on threads and we just got talking for a little bit, another major no

226
00:13:24,765 --> 00:13:28,325
Speaker 2:  earth shattering scoops. So I asked him this question like, is this button

227
00:13:28,355 --> 00:13:32,325
Speaker 2:  here because this is a new input method for the phone, right? Is

228
00:13:32,325 --> 00:13:35,925
Speaker 2:  this a camera shutter button? Is this just for camera nerds? Like

229
00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:38,685
Speaker 2:  Phil's a camera nerd? We we talk about cameras every time we, we see each

230
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:42,165
Speaker 2:  other. Or is it you want people to

231
00:13:42,715 --> 00:13:46,565
Speaker 2:  have their iPhone engage with the world visually, right? You want the AI

232
00:13:46,565 --> 00:13:49,325
Speaker 2:  to be able to see stuff. So you need to put this button right here so You

233
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:51,965
Speaker 2:  can like open it right away and like look at stuff with your iPhone. and

234
00:13:51,985 --> 00:13:55,965
Speaker 2:  it was basically like, yeah, it's both like, people use their

235
00:13:55,965 --> 00:13:59,685
Speaker 2:  iPhones for cameras all the time. It's convenient. We already see that's

236
00:13:59,685 --> 00:14:03,245
Speaker 2:  happening. But at the same time we have, I, you know, we have cameras on

237
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:07,165
Speaker 2:  iPads and people use 'em as document scanners and we are just aware, like

238
00:14:07,165 --> 00:14:11,045
Speaker 2:  Apple's just aware of the universe of things the camera

239
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:15,045
Speaker 2:  is already doing for people like scanning QR codes to get

240
00:14:15,095 --> 00:14:18,125
Speaker 2:  menus at restaurants. So I pushed him on it and he was like, no, it's both.

241
00:14:18,155 --> 00:14:21,445
Speaker 2:  Like, you have to see it as both. And we've seen it as both for a long time.

242
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:25,725
Speaker 2:  So I think you're right David, that like there's a, a

243
00:14:25,795 --> 00:14:29,605
Speaker 2:  view towards a long-term future where The iPhone is just looking at

244
00:14:29,605 --> 00:14:33,285
Speaker 2:  stuff and being smart about it. And then there's right now, which is people

245
00:14:33,315 --> 00:14:36,605
Speaker 2:  need to open the camera and take a photo and we're in a, this button represents

246
00:14:36,645 --> 00:14:40,565
Speaker 2:  a little bit of a transition, but none of the

247
00:14:40,765 --> 00:14:43,325
Speaker 2:  features are shipping. So it's Right. It's just a camera button.

248
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:47,365
Speaker 3:  So, okay. This is actually, if I'm being completely honest with you, the

249
00:14:47,365 --> 00:14:49,885
Speaker 3:  single biggest question I have for you, as somebody who has held one of these

250
00:14:49,885 --> 00:14:53,405
Speaker 3:  phones, is it a button all Apple calls? It is camera

251
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:57,405
Speaker 3:  control. Yeah. Like Apple Studiously avoids calling it a

252
00:14:57,405 --> 00:15:01,125
Speaker 3:  button. And from the description in the keynote, it sounds a little bit like,

253
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:04,845
Speaker 3:  it's, it's kind of, I I think I, I compared it to like the Mac, a teeny tiny

254
00:15:04,845 --> 00:15:07,925
Speaker 3:  MacBook track pad where it's like mostly doing the haptic thing and it doesn't

255
00:15:07,925 --> 00:15:10,805
Speaker 3:  really move, but it feels like it's moving and You can, you know, move your

256
00:15:10,805 --> 00:15:14,205
Speaker 3:  finger around and it, it's sensitive that way, but it's not like a clicky

257
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:17,165
Speaker 3:  button, is it? What, what is this thing? Does the button

258
00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:21,245
Speaker 2:  Move? It is, it is a physical, honest to god clicky button. Okay.

259
00:15:21,245 --> 00:15:21,445
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

260
00:15:21,785 --> 00:15:22,685
Speaker 3:  But that makes me feel bad.

261
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:23,285
Speaker 2:  I was really

262
00:15:23,285 --> 00:15:24,165
Speaker 3:  Worried. No,

263
00:15:24,545 --> 00:15:28,365
Speaker 2:  It also does the other thing, which is very confusing. And every

264
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:32,325
Speaker 2:  time I've used it, I've used it now a dozen times, my brain is still trying

265
00:15:32,325 --> 00:15:34,405
Speaker 2:  to figure it out. So, and, and I'm not saying it's like hard to figure out.

266
00:15:34,795 --> 00:15:37,085
Speaker 2:  It's just one of those things you have to use for a little bit and like figure

267
00:15:37,105 --> 00:15:40,965
Speaker 2:  it out. So when you, it's capacitive,

268
00:15:40,985 --> 00:15:44,765
Speaker 2:  the reason they're not calling it a shutter button is 'cause it, it has like

269
00:15:45,405 --> 00:15:49,165
Speaker 2:  multiple functions inside of it. So, and the, and

270
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:52,965
Speaker 2:  they're all enabled by the fact that it is both extremely pressure sensitive

271
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:57,405
Speaker 2:  and capacitive. So You can just push it down and it clicks

272
00:15:57,505 --> 00:16:01,245
Speaker 2:  and that'll take a photo like every time that's gonna take a photo. And the

273
00:16:01,305 --> 00:16:05,205
Speaker 2:  new sensors are zero lag. So You can just bang away on even

274
00:16:05,305 --> 00:16:08,605
Speaker 2:  the regular iPhone 16. But also on the, on The iPhone 16 Pro, just taking

275
00:16:08,605 --> 00:16:10,365
Speaker 2:  pictures, zero shutter lag. You're off the races.

276
00:16:10,365 --> 00:16:11,205
Speaker 3:  That's pretty cool. Yeah.

277
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:14,285
Speaker 2:  That's cool. If you like, I don't even know how to If. you think about moving

278
00:16:14,285 --> 00:16:18,245
Speaker 2:  your finger, it'll register like a tap. Do you know what I mean? Like

279
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:20,645
Speaker 2:  you're not, you don't, 'cause you don't want to push it. You wanna like,

280
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:24,125
Speaker 2:  just like give it a little, little, you know?

281
00:16:24,675 --> 00:16:28,485
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Just like I'm thinking about you. And that'll, and that'll open up

282
00:16:28,485 --> 00:16:31,365
Speaker 2:  one menu, And, if you do it twice, you get like the big menu

283
00:16:32,285 --> 00:16:35,885
Speaker 2:  and You can like switch between modes. So like, by default it's like the

284
00:16:35,885 --> 00:16:38,565
Speaker 2:  zoom. So you like hold it down a little bit and you get like the zoom thing

285
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:41,485
Speaker 2:  and then You can like slide your finger back and forth to Zoom. But You can

286
00:16:41,485 --> 00:16:44,245
Speaker 2:  also click down again and switch to the new photo styles or switch between

287
00:16:44,245 --> 00:16:48,125
Speaker 2:  the lenses or all this other stuff. Eventually you're able to lock

288
00:16:48,365 --> 00:16:49,645
Speaker 2:  exposure and, and focus.

289
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:54,125
Speaker 3:  I'm like dangerously worried that you're describing like 3D touch

290
00:16:54,385 --> 00:16:57,565
Speaker 3:  or forced touch. Yeah. Both ideas that Apple has had that didn't go super

291
00:16:57,595 --> 00:17:01,485
Speaker 3:  well for Apple. The idea of like, what if we gave you infinite

292
00:17:01,485 --> 00:17:04,445
Speaker 3:  levels of pressure to push and different things happen depending on what

293
00:17:04,445 --> 00:17:06,685
Speaker 3:  you did. And everybody's like, actually this sucks and I can't figure out

294
00:17:06,685 --> 00:17:07,125
Speaker 3:  how to use it.

295
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:11,005
Speaker 2:  Well, so the the reason it's gonna work is because Apple's not depending

296
00:17:11,005 --> 00:17:13,165
Speaker 2:  on like third party app developers to do anything

297
00:17:13,605 --> 00:17:13,885
Speaker 3:  Fair.

298
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:17,045
Speaker 2:  They've just, they're just like, here it is. Here's how it works. And You

299
00:17:17,045 --> 00:17:20,525
Speaker 2:  can, like I said, it it is, I have not immediately sussed it out,

300
00:17:20,905 --> 00:17:24,285
Speaker 2:  but You can see how you will. And the thing that's actually the most confusing

301
00:17:24,285 --> 00:17:28,165
Speaker 2:  about it is If, you are used to a MacBook track pad where the click

302
00:17:28,165 --> 00:17:31,885
Speaker 2:  is fake. The fact that it is actually a physical click to take a photo

303
00:17:32,265 --> 00:17:35,045
Speaker 2:  is the thing your brain can't get around, right? Because You can, You can

304
00:17:35,045 --> 00:17:38,445
Speaker 2:  press hard enough to make it do stuff, but then You can press even harder

305
00:17:38,585 --> 00:17:40,525
Speaker 2:  to make it take a photo.

306
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:43,925
Speaker 5:  Ooh, this is gonna be a mess for people. I'm so excited.

307
00:17:43,995 --> 00:17:46,525
Speaker 2:  It's not, it's something that I I promise you it won't be that messy. It'll

308
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:49,205
Speaker 2:  just be like a week of very confusing results. Yeah. I

309
00:17:49,205 --> 00:17:50,485
Speaker 5:  Mean that's gonna be a great week.

310
00:17:50,595 --> 00:17:53,085
Speaker 3:  Well it sounds like the hard part is gonna be all this stuff in the middle.

311
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:56,325
Speaker 3:  Yeah. If, you just button mash it'll take a picture. Yeah. Which is what

312
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,165
Speaker 3:  most people want to

313
00:17:57,165 --> 00:17:59,445
Speaker 2:  Do. Yeah. and it falls. Right. And then, but then the capacitive stuff is,

314
00:17:59,825 --> 00:18:03,565
Speaker 2:  is wild too because it, it's an iPhone, right? It's iOS. So it has

315
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:07,485
Speaker 2:  inertia. So when you're like looking at your range of zooms, You can

316
00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:10,845
Speaker 2:  just like slide your finger really fast and it'll just fly to the next de

317
00:18:10,845 --> 00:18:14,765
Speaker 2:  tent. Yeah. Right. Or fly between lenses or If, you have it

318
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:17,765
Speaker 2:  open to the lens switcher. And there where there's no detents, You can just

319
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:21,405
Speaker 2:  like go from the farthest zoom to the ultra wide by just like swiping really

320
00:18:21,405 --> 00:18:25,165
Speaker 2:  fast and it'll just like roll. So there, it just as a hardware

321
00:18:25,485 --> 00:18:29,325
Speaker 2:  software appley thing, it's, it is like absolutely not just a

322
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:33,205
Speaker 2:  button. Like it is like another weird little touch surface with

323
00:18:33,205 --> 00:18:36,205
Speaker 2:  a lot of ideas packed into it. And the idea is

324
00:18:37,265 --> 00:18:40,525
Speaker 2:  for as much as I can tell that you should basically be able to control the

325
00:18:40,525 --> 00:18:44,405
Speaker 2:  entire camera from this button. Hmm. There's parts of it

326
00:18:44,405 --> 00:18:47,765
Speaker 2:  that you can't do, but you should basically be able to,

327
00:18:48,305 --> 00:18:51,405
Speaker 2:  you know, like a, a real camera's, like lots of buttons and knobs and exposure

328
00:18:51,405 --> 00:18:55,325
Speaker 2:  compensation and, and styles and macro. And they've got a lot of

329
00:18:55,325 --> 00:18:57,125
Speaker 2:  those ideas inside the camera control button.

330
00:18:57,355 --> 00:19:01,045
Speaker 5:  What if this becomes like a generational thing? You know how like

331
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,845
Speaker 5:  your parents are always turning the light on on their phone 'cause they kind

332
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:08,605
Speaker 5:  of screw it up and we're just like, like our brains just can't process

333
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:11,165
Speaker 5:  it. We'll hit it like an age point where we're like, we just can't use the

334
00:19:11,165 --> 00:19:14,245
Speaker 5:  camera control because it's so complex.

335
00:19:14,885 --> 00:19:18,205
Speaker 5:  Because it does sound like there's like a lot of like, it's like really awesome

336
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:21,925
Speaker 5:  and that there's a lot of opportunity with it. But also it does sound super

337
00:19:21,925 --> 00:19:22,405
Speaker 5:  complex.

338
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:25,245
Speaker 2:  I think people are trying to figure out what that middle part where you're

339
00:19:25,245 --> 00:19:29,125
Speaker 2:  lightly tapping is for that might be confusing. But like David

340
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:33,085
Speaker 2:  is saying, If, you just push the button really hard, it'll take a picture.

341
00:19:33,185 --> 00:19:36,645
Speaker 2:  And that, that part seems very, I will say that there are, there are, we,

342
00:19:36,645 --> 00:19:40,365
Speaker 2:  we have weird hue lights switches in my house. You have to push really hard

343
00:19:41,665 --> 00:19:45,325
Speaker 2:  and people often don't push them hard enough. And so maybe

344
00:19:45,325 --> 00:19:48,805
Speaker 2:  they're just like, won't, maybe they just won't push this button hard enough

345
00:19:48,935 --> 00:19:52,645
Speaker 3:  Maybe. Yeah. So what, what I've found myself wondering about this is I

346
00:19:52,885 --> 00:19:56,445
Speaker 3:  actually get all of the reasons Apple would make this thing. Right? Like

347
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,565
Speaker 3:  it actually makes a lot of sense. It seems like a really useful controller.

348
00:20:00,585 --> 00:20:04,525
Speaker 3:  It also, it makes sense both in, in landscape and

349
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:07,405
Speaker 3:  vertical mode, which is very clever. Like to make a button that feels like

350
00:20:07,405 --> 00:20:10,845
Speaker 3:  it'll work whether I'm holding my phone like this and using my index finger

351
00:20:10,845 --> 00:20:13,525
Speaker 3:  or holding my phone like this and using my thumb strikes me as very clever.

352
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:16,605
Speaker 3:  What I don't understand is why this isn't the action button. Like why didn't

353
00:20:16,605 --> 00:20:19,805
Speaker 3:  they ship this last year and call it the action button? That makes way more

354
00:20:19,805 --> 00:20:22,765
Speaker 3:  sense to me than calling it camera control. There's all kinds of interesting

355
00:20:22,765 --> 00:20:26,565
Speaker 3:  stuff you could let developers do with this. It feels like vastly deeper

356
00:20:26,745 --> 00:20:30,365
Speaker 3:  and cooler and more interesting than like, here long press this button and

357
00:20:30,545 --> 00:20:31,605
Speaker 3:  one of eight things will happen.

358
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:36,125
Speaker 3:  It's possible. The answer is just, it wasn't ready so they shipped it. But

359
00:20:36,395 --> 00:20:39,565
Speaker 3:  like, this seems to me to be what the action button always should have been.

360
00:20:40,085 --> 00:20:43,485
Speaker 2:  I think I disagree with that. I think the, the action button is,

361
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:46,765
Speaker 2:  we, I mean we talked about this so much last week. The action button is meant

362
00:20:46,765 --> 00:20:50,445
Speaker 2:  to to be a configurable macro button. Sure. and it just

363
00:20:50,445 --> 00:20:54,285
Speaker 2:  happens that most people thought the camera was the most useful macro. But

364
00:20:54,285 --> 00:20:57,965
Speaker 2:  I think apple's all in on the idea that you should just have a button on

365
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,525
Speaker 2:  your phone that opens your transit app or launches a shortcut

366
00:21:01,945 --> 00:21:05,805
Speaker 2:  or it does one of any number of appliance, like things that your

367
00:21:05,805 --> 00:21:06,245
Speaker 2:  phone does.

368
00:21:06,655 --> 00:21:09,245
Speaker 3:  Shout out to all the people who told us about the transit apps, by the way.

369
00:21:09,245 --> 00:21:12,045
Speaker 3:  Yes. We got a lot of feedback from people who use it for their transit apps.

370
00:21:12,275 --> 00:21:15,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I, and I think Apple's like super into this. 'cause what they were

371
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:19,485
Speaker 2:  doing before was like weird triple clicks of

372
00:21:19,485 --> 00:21:22,925
Speaker 2:  the home button to accomplish these goals. Right now they just have another

373
00:21:22,925 --> 00:21:26,845
Speaker 2:  surface to map things onto. And the

374
00:21:26,845 --> 00:21:30,685
Speaker 2:  fact that everyone is using it for the camera, I think was proof to them

375
00:21:30,995 --> 00:21:32,685
Speaker 2:  that they needed a camera button too.

376
00:21:33,145 --> 00:21:35,645
Speaker 3:  So you think that I, I mean, and I guess you're probably right, like I was

377
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:38,765
Speaker 3:  thinking that there's a roadmap for this that ends in it being something

378
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:42,685
Speaker 3:  that like every developer can do stuff with and it becomes like a, a system

379
00:21:42,785 --> 00:21:46,045
Speaker 3:  for controlling how you do lots of things. But what you're saying, and I

380
00:21:46,045 --> 00:21:48,445
Speaker 3:  guess what's probably right, given the fact that it's called camera control

381
00:21:48,465 --> 00:21:51,565
Speaker 3:  is like this thing is about the camera. Like yeah, maybe it will be the camera

382
00:21:51,705 --> 00:21:55,525
Speaker 3:  in lots of apps, but like this is a camera thing. And that is, I

383
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:59,005
Speaker 3:  I agree with you in that sense that this is like this, this thing has a real

384
00:21:59,005 --> 00:22:02,885
Speaker 3:  sort of statement of purpose that the action button like deliberately

385
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:03,805
Speaker 3:  does not, do

386
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:07,645
Speaker 5:  You guys think it means that eventually we don't get that

387
00:22:07,755 --> 00:22:10,965
Speaker 5:  port free Totally smooth glass iPhone?

388
00:22:12,185 --> 00:22:15,845
Speaker 2:  Yes. I I think that that idea is officially put to bed. Yeah.

389
00:22:16,285 --> 00:22:19,765
Speaker 2:  I I I don't think they have any interest in that. In fact, since those rumors

390
00:22:19,765 --> 00:22:23,445
Speaker 2:  have started, we've had two physical buttons added to The iPhone

391
00:22:25,585 --> 00:22:29,165
Speaker 2:  And, and I think Apple one realizes, charging

392
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:32,965
Speaker 2:  wise, these phones are more power hungry than ever. Especially as they start

393
00:22:32,965 --> 00:22:36,325
Speaker 2:  adding AI features to them, people are gonna have to charge their phones

394
00:22:36,635 --> 00:22:39,045
Speaker 2:  more so that port's not going away.

395
00:22:40,585 --> 00:22:44,245
Speaker 2:  And then two, I think the things you want to do, like very quickly on a phone

396
00:22:44,825 --> 00:22:48,645
Speaker 2:  are going to start to take primacy over the idea of opening the home screen

397
00:22:48,645 --> 00:22:52,565
Speaker 2:  and picking an app. And again, the AI part of it

398
00:22:52,575 --> 00:22:56,445
Speaker 2:  where they, they call it visual intelligence where the phone can

399
00:22:56,825 --> 00:23:00,765
Speaker 2:  see the world that I, I think the primacy of that is

400
00:23:00,835 --> 00:23:04,405
Speaker 2:  very, very high. Yeah. And so over time this button might get

401
00:23:04,405 --> 00:23:07,765
Speaker 2:  optimized for some of that. But right now Apple knows, like

402
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,525
Speaker 2:  for a lot of people, The iPhone is a, a web browser, a really good messaging

403
00:23:11,525 --> 00:23:14,965
Speaker 2:  client and a really good camera. And so if they can just be like, now the

404
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:18,245
Speaker 2:  camera's easier, there's actually a chance they can get you to do other stuff

405
00:23:18,245 --> 00:23:18,685
Speaker 2:  on the phone.

406
00:23:19,275 --> 00:23:23,245
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Well and I think that that pushes the same one behind a lot

407
00:23:23,245 --> 00:23:26,645
Speaker 3:  of what's in like iOS 18, right? Which is more customization, they're pulling

408
00:23:26,755 --> 00:23:30,085
Speaker 3:  more stuff out of apps and onto the lock screen and onto the home screen

409
00:23:30,105 --> 00:23:34,005
Speaker 3:  and into widgets and into live activities. Like the idea that you

410
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:37,965
Speaker 3:  should be able to do most things on your phone without doing very

411
00:23:37,965 --> 00:23:41,885
Speaker 3:  much feels totally central to like the entire design of The

412
00:23:41,885 --> 00:23:44,765
Speaker 3:  iPhone both hardware and software. And as it happens, I think it's exactly

413
00:23:44,765 --> 00:23:47,845
Speaker 3:  correct and I'm very, very happy about that. Like, we'll see

414
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:51,725
Speaker 2:  How every app developer feels about this, right? Like, you know,

415
00:23:51,725 --> 00:23:55,285
Speaker 2:  it was not for nothing that Apple very specifically called out. When you

416
00:23:55,285 --> 00:23:58,805
Speaker 2:  do visual intelligence features and you search for a restaurant,

417
00:23:59,475 --> 00:24:01,845
Speaker 2:  like you take a picture of a restaurant, it just tells you what the restaurant

418
00:24:01,845 --> 00:24:05,165
Speaker 2:  is, it's rating and the menu and it's like, where's that coming from? And

419
00:24:05,165 --> 00:24:08,885
Speaker 2:  the answer is Yelp. Right? Can they swap in another provider for

420
00:24:09,005 --> 00:24:12,885
Speaker 2:  Yelp? Yeah, probably in other countries where Yelp isn't like the, the

421
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:16,205
Speaker 2:  dominant provider of that info, like Apple will swap it. But then they were

422
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:19,005
Speaker 2:  also very careful to say, if we don't know what's going on, we'll ask Google.

423
00:24:19,545 --> 00:24:22,125
Speaker 2:  And if we recognize that what you're looking at is like a blank

424
00:24:23,445 --> 00:24:27,405
Speaker 2:  homework page, we'll like ask chat GPT to like help you. So they're, they're

425
00:24:27,405 --> 00:24:31,085
Speaker 2:  trying to expand the like universe of third party services they can talk

426
00:24:31,085 --> 00:24:34,565
Speaker 2:  to. The question is whether any of that becomes modular, how any of those

427
00:24:34,845 --> 00:24:36,965
Speaker 2:  services make money, right? No one seems to know.

428
00:24:37,235 --> 00:24:39,965
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I mean that's kind of the whole Apple intelligence question, right?

429
00:24:40,025 --> 00:24:43,205
Speaker 3:  Is like Apple. Apple seems to be building this very

430
00:24:43,705 --> 00:24:47,205
Speaker 3:  simple seeming beautiful thing that it doesn't make any sense how the rest

431
00:24:47,205 --> 00:24:48,885
Speaker 3:  of the ecosystem around it works.

432
00:24:49,565 --> 00:24:52,965
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And, and and to be clear, the the weirdest part of these phones,

433
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:56,725
Speaker 2:  they were announced as the first phones built for Apple intelligence. They're

434
00:24:56,725 --> 00:25:00,605
Speaker 2:  going to launch with none of it. And may, and maybe that's only true for

435
00:25:00,605 --> 00:25:04,365
Speaker 2:  a couple weeks, right? They're, they're launching September 20th is,

436
00:25:04,425 --> 00:25:07,045
Speaker 2:  is the on sale date. You can pre-order 'em, I think next week or the end

437
00:25:07,045 --> 00:25:11,005
Speaker 2:  of this week, 18.1 io 18.1 is supposed to arrive sometime in

438
00:25:11,005 --> 00:25:14,965
Speaker 2:  October with the first set of Apple Intelligence features, right? So it's

439
00:25:14,965 --> 00:25:18,485
Speaker 2:  only a few weeks gap, but that's maybe at most a month gap. Right?

440
00:25:18,745 --> 00:25:22,685
Speaker 2:  But that's a long gap to launch a phone without its highlight features.

441
00:25:22,835 --> 00:25:23,125
Speaker 2:  It's

442
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:27,005
Speaker 3:  A long gap. It's also, it's launching on 18.1 in beta and it's only

443
00:25:27,005 --> 00:25:30,605
Speaker 3:  launching some of the features, like some of the stuff that shipping is gonna

444
00:25:30,605 --> 00:25:33,925
Speaker 3:  be very cool, right? Like transcriptions and summaries coming to voice memos

445
00:25:33,925 --> 00:25:36,805
Speaker 3:  like that, the, the stuff that's coming to mail where they can rewrite your

446
00:25:36,805 --> 00:25:39,645
Speaker 3:  email, which Apple brought up like 11 times during this event. Like

447
00:25:40,275 --> 00:25:40,925
Speaker 2:  It's what they got.

448
00:25:41,075 --> 00:25:44,725
Speaker 3:  Dear God, stop giving us tools to write worse emails. Like please, I'm

449
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:48,645
Speaker 2:  Begging you that is right up there with Apple explaining what bigger screens

450
00:25:48,645 --> 00:25:51,445
Speaker 2:  are for. Like You can read an extra

451
00:25:51,445 --> 00:25:51,805
Speaker 3:  Line of text.

452
00:25:52,345 --> 00:25:55,965
Speaker 2:  We are truly killing time in these events at, at some point, like,

453
00:25:56,305 --> 00:26:00,125
Speaker 2:  or Apple thinks everyone is stupid. It might be both, but they're, it might

454
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:03,565
Speaker 2:  be both the screen's bigger You can have fit more content on a bigger screen

455
00:26:03,585 --> 00:26:07,485
Speaker 2:  is like a regular explanation at Apple event. Right next

456
00:26:07,485 --> 00:26:11,085
Speaker 2:  to, hey, you wrote a bad email and now the robot will write a nice email

457
00:26:12,025 --> 00:26:15,165
Speaker 3:  So, so that our robot on the other end can read it and summarize it for you

458
00:26:15,425 --> 00:26:19,205
Speaker 3:  and then rewrite an, it's just, it's just Apple mail

459
00:26:19,525 --> 00:26:20,525
Speaker 3:  nonsense all the way down from

460
00:26:20,525 --> 00:26:24,325
Speaker 2:  Here on, by the way, the actual flow. We're hitting the boundaries

461
00:26:24,585 --> 00:26:28,365
Speaker 2:  of text handling and interface metaphors in iOS 18

462
00:26:28,435 --> 00:26:32,285
Speaker 2:  with some of the say AI stuff. So If, you wanna like use these

463
00:26:32,485 --> 00:26:36,165
Speaker 2:  features in 19.1, you've got like a long thing in like notes, right?

464
00:26:36,465 --> 00:26:40,325
Speaker 2:  And you wanna summarize it and send an email. You have to select all of it,

465
00:26:40,655 --> 00:26:44,085
Speaker 2:  which is like grab the handle and like scroll all the way down

466
00:26:44,465 --> 00:26:48,365
Speaker 2:  or you know, if some apps have the select all fine and then you have to

467
00:26:48,545 --> 00:26:52,325
Speaker 2:  tap it again to get that select that little menu that like modal popup menu

468
00:26:52,385 --> 00:26:56,205
Speaker 2:  to come back up. And then you hit like writing tools and then it brings up

469
00:26:56,245 --> 00:26:59,765
Speaker 2:  a sheet. And that to me is just bananas.

470
00:27:00,365 --> 00:27:04,205
Speaker 3:  I just wanna say, based on my ongoing ability to like

471
00:27:04,885 --> 00:27:08,845
Speaker 3:  accurately cut and paste things over time, the odds of me

472
00:27:08,845 --> 00:27:12,685
Speaker 3:  getting all three of those taps correct in a row right?

473
00:27:12,785 --> 00:27:14,125
Speaker 3:  Is like one in four. Like

474
00:27:14,305 --> 00:27:15,805
Speaker 5:  So like a video game. Yeah.

475
00:27:15,825 --> 00:27:16,605
Speaker 3:  It really is. Is

476
00:27:17,065 --> 00:27:19,325
Speaker 5:  Prince a Persia on your phone? You're gonna have a great time.

477
00:27:20,755 --> 00:27:23,805
Speaker 2:  Well, you know, The iPhone can now play AAA console games. Alex with five.

478
00:27:24,265 --> 00:27:26,085
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah. Assassin's Creed. Sorry, sorry. Sure.

479
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:30,405
Speaker 2:  Summer even stopped us. Like they did it. They mentioned us. No, but

480
00:27:30,545 --> 00:27:34,365
Speaker 2:  it is just like, if, if that's the thing you're selling and actually Text

481
00:27:34,605 --> 00:27:38,285
Speaker 2:  Ling on an iPhone is is I would say it's messy. It's just, it's

482
00:27:38,605 --> 00:27:42,245
Speaker 2:  not like they've, they've revolutionized it. No,

483
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:44,085
Speaker 3:  It's pretty inelegant and it has been forever.

484
00:27:44,085 --> 00:27:46,765
Speaker 2:  It's, it's basically the same way it has been since like they added it to

485
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,805
Speaker 2:  The iPhone. You're now at a place where you're like, oh, we're straining

486
00:27:49,865 --> 00:27:53,605
Speaker 2:  the interface metaphors of this in a real way. Yeah. Because yeah, we're

487
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:57,245
Speaker 2:  asking people to do, to use these new features is move a lot of text

488
00:27:57,245 --> 00:28:01,165
Speaker 2:  around or like take action on a lot of text and it

489
00:28:01,165 --> 00:28:05,005
Speaker 2:  just doesn't, the, the iOS was not like built for that

490
00:28:05,105 --> 00:28:08,805
Speaker 2:  in a particular way and now in the way that a desktop computer like

491
00:28:08,805 --> 00:28:12,485
Speaker 2:  obviously is, and now we might, I hope Apple like takes the opportunity to

492
00:28:12,485 --> 00:28:16,325
Speaker 2:  be like, we should rethink text handling here or like fine cursor control.

493
00:28:16,555 --> 00:28:20,485
Speaker 5:  Okay. But, but there was one AI feature that actually seemed good in

494
00:28:20,485 --> 00:28:23,405
Speaker 5:  this that they, that they pointed out this time, which I don't think they

495
00:28:23,405 --> 00:28:27,045
Speaker 5:  mentioned at WW DC, which is that You can just ask

496
00:28:27,195 --> 00:28:29,765
Speaker 5:  Siri to like tell you how to do stuff on your phone.

497
00:28:30,265 --> 00:28:33,525
Speaker 2:  No, they didn't ask that at wwc, did they? It's that's very much the like,

498
00:28:33,525 --> 00:28:37,485
Speaker 2:  future of user manuals is generative ai. Yeah. Like we have to, we have to

499
00:28:37,485 --> 00:28:41,325
Speaker 2:  boil the ocean in order to make a useful user manual for your

500
00:28:41,325 --> 00:28:44,725
Speaker 2:  iPhone. I mean this, this idea has been around forever.

501
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:48,925
Speaker 2:  Bixby, Samsung's Bixby is this idea. Yeah, you will talk to your phone and

502
00:28:48,925 --> 00:28:50,245
Speaker 2:  like it'll do stuff but

503
00:28:50,305 --> 00:28:53,845
Speaker 5:  No one's done it well and I just, I keep thinking of all these people who

504
00:28:54,305 --> 00:28:57,205
Speaker 5:  go to Howtos who are using all these other ways to try to figure out how

505
00:28:57,205 --> 00:29:00,405
Speaker 5:  to use their phone and theoretically Apple's gonna make it better.

506
00:29:01,385 --> 00:29:02,725
Speaker 5:  But you have to know to ask,

507
00:29:03,165 --> 00:29:06,925
Speaker 2:  I saw a demo of this today. I don't remember, did it work? It's like a haze

508
00:29:06,925 --> 00:29:10,765
Speaker 2:  of demos. Yeah. They, they were showing me like You can

509
00:29:10,785 --> 00:29:14,565
Speaker 2:  ask it how to do x, y, z feature and it totally worked. Yeah. They were obviously

510
00:29:14,565 --> 00:29:18,245
Speaker 2:  running 18.1 beta, not 18.0, which we'll ship with. but it worked.

511
00:29:18,525 --> 00:29:20,725
Speaker 2:  I mean And, if you really think about all that's happening here is Apple

512
00:29:20,785 --> 00:29:23,405
Speaker 2:  has a model that's running locally on the phone and then they have their

513
00:29:23,405 --> 00:29:27,085
Speaker 2:  own user manuals, which they could load into the model, right? So

514
00:29:27,145 --> 00:29:30,685
Speaker 2:  you're asking a question of a pretty known set of information from their

515
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:33,965
Speaker 2:  own knowledge base and and whatnot. And yeah. That, that's a pretty straightforward

516
00:29:33,965 --> 00:29:37,125
Speaker 2:  use case that I I think they've, I don't know how much people will use it,

517
00:29:37,145 --> 00:29:39,205
Speaker 2:  but from what I've seen, it works pretty well. Yeah,

518
00:29:39,785 --> 00:29:43,005
Speaker 5:  No I think it's like, it could be really useful if they actually promoted

519
00:29:43,005 --> 00:29:46,285
Speaker 5:  it. 'cause I think of all the old people in my life who don't know how to

520
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,365
Speaker 5:  use their phones. Right?

521
00:29:47,365 --> 00:29:49,405
Speaker 2:  But now you gotta get them to, to use Siri. Yeah.

522
00:29:49,405 --> 00:29:51,445
Speaker 5:  Now you're gonna be able to be like, no, you asked Siri, don't ask me. You

523
00:29:51,445 --> 00:29:52,245
Speaker 5:  ask Siri now

524
00:29:52,865 --> 00:29:55,845
Speaker 3:  Me out of it. and it assumes that you You can ask Siri in a way that is not

525
00:29:56,805 --> 00:30:00,485
Speaker 3:  prescribed and doesn't have to be a very specific kind of way. And like,

526
00:30:00,695 --> 00:30:04,085
Speaker 3:  again, so much of what Apple is asking us to assume

527
00:30:04,545 --> 00:30:08,365
Speaker 3:  is that after what, 13 years Apple has made

528
00:30:08,435 --> 00:30:11,965
Speaker 3:  Siri good and I just am so not ready to assume that yet.

529
00:30:12,825 --> 00:30:14,805
Speaker 3:  But back to what you were saying Neli about when all this stuff is rolling

530
00:30:14,805 --> 00:30:18,365
Speaker 3:  out, this stuff is rolling out in beta in pieces

531
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:22,365
Speaker 3:  in October and the, the biggest thing of it, which is

532
00:30:22,365 --> 00:30:24,725
Speaker 2:  This, wait, can I, can I just be really clear about that? 'cause even that

533
00:30:24,725 --> 00:30:27,445
Speaker 2:  is confusing. So it's in beta right now?

534
00:30:28,545 --> 00:30:29,285
Speaker 5:  Yes. You can

535
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:32,725
Speaker 2:  Technically do it right now. This is weird, right? It's iOS 18.1, public

536
00:30:32,795 --> 00:30:35,005
Speaker 2:  beta is available. You can push the button, You can download it, You can

537
00:30:35,005 --> 00:30:38,965
Speaker 2:  run it. If, you have a 15 Pro You can run Apple Intelligence some stuff

538
00:30:38,965 --> 00:30:42,685
Speaker 2:  right now it's gonna launch in the public release of iOS

539
00:30:42,885 --> 00:30:45,525
Speaker 2:  18.1 sometime in October. And they're

540
00:30:45,525 --> 00:30:48,045
Speaker 3:  Still calling it a beta in the public release. Right. Which

541
00:30:48,045 --> 00:30:51,325
Speaker 2:  Is insane. The the features will be labeled beta in the release. And they've

542
00:30:51,325 --> 00:30:54,365
Speaker 2:  done this a handful of times. They did it with portrait mode. Yeah.

543
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,445
Speaker 3:  Free form. The app launched like that I think.

544
00:30:56,595 --> 00:31:00,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah. They a couple other things like, like

545
00:31:00,445 --> 00:31:03,725
Speaker 2:  FaceTime audio transcriptions or something launched this way there, there's

546
00:31:03,725 --> 00:31:07,685
Speaker 2:  a handful of this stuff. Deep Fusion technically was in beta, but nobody

547
00:31:07,685 --> 00:31:10,685
Speaker 2:  could see it. No one can still see it. So it's, it's fine.

548
00:31:11,525 --> 00:31:15,165
Speaker 2:  So Apple has this history of doing this, right? Yeah. Particularly with the

549
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:18,205
Speaker 2:  camera. But now what they're gonna do is they're gonna say huge chunks of

550
00:31:18,205 --> 00:31:21,325
Speaker 2:  this operating system are, are in beta and they're just gonna have the label

551
00:31:21,345 --> 00:31:25,325
Speaker 2:  and the release. So it's not in beta, you have to go get it. It's in

552
00:31:25,325 --> 00:31:29,085
Speaker 2:  the public release. It'll be labeled with the beta, which is a little, that's

553
00:31:29,085 --> 00:31:29,245
Speaker 2:  messy.

554
00:31:29,495 --> 00:31:29,845
Speaker 5:  Which

555
00:31:29,845 --> 00:31:33,365
Speaker 3:  Is kind of like just saying here it is, it might suck. Which is to be fair

556
00:31:33,515 --> 00:31:36,525
Speaker 3:  what all of the AI systems do right now, every, they all have the label at

557
00:31:36,525 --> 00:31:39,165
Speaker 3:  the bottom that's like, this thing might lie to you, we don't know. Yeah.

558
00:31:39,545 --> 00:31:40,085
Speaker 3:  Not our problem.

559
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:43,645
Speaker 5:  It's also kind of what they did at this event when they announced all of

560
00:31:43,645 --> 00:31:46,845
Speaker 5:  this, they were like, and now we're doing Apple Intelligence also. This is

561
00:31:46,845 --> 00:31:48,525
Speaker 5:  just a recap of WW DC.

562
00:31:49,315 --> 00:31:52,485
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And all of the features were couched that you will be able to without

563
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:56,525
Speaker 2:  any hard dates. And So, I, again, I, I don't

564
00:31:56,525 --> 00:32:00,085
Speaker 2:  care how many iPhones Apple sells to quote our friend and mentor

565
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:04,045
Speaker 2:  Walt Mossberg, I don't give a fuck about your stock price. I just don't.

566
00:32:04,785 --> 00:32:08,285
Speaker 2:  But you know, if one of the questions is, is this worth upgrading? The answer

567
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:12,285
Speaker 2:  is not in the hardware, the answer is in the software. Right. If, you

568
00:32:12,285 --> 00:32:15,645
Speaker 2:  have a regular iPhone or any pro phone save the 15 Pro

569
00:32:16,265 --> 00:32:19,885
Speaker 2:  to get Apple Intelligence features, you need a new phone. Right.

570
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:24,205
Speaker 2:  Okay, that's a good question. Like, is the new, are the features worth

571
00:32:24,205 --> 00:32:28,125
Speaker 2:  an upgrade? The answer right now is no, because they're

572
00:32:28,135 --> 00:32:31,765
Speaker 2:  vapor. And I will just refer you back to one of the Virgin's longstanding

573
00:32:31,765 --> 00:32:35,325
Speaker 2:  rules right up there with world of no sevens and review. What's in the box

574
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,325
Speaker 2:  is it's a vapor until it ships.

575
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:37,845
Speaker 3:  Yep.

576
00:32:38,265 --> 00:32:41,005
Speaker 2:  And it hasn't shipped yet. Apple has a great track record of shipping. I

577
00:32:41,105 --> 00:32:43,965
Speaker 2:  I'm not, I don't mean to say this in a pejorative way, but it's vapor until

578
00:32:43,965 --> 00:32:47,325
Speaker 2:  it ships. So you, you just like cannot evaluate this thing. 'cause it's not

579
00:32:47,325 --> 00:32:48,445
Speaker 2:  real in any way, shape, or form.

580
00:32:48,445 --> 00:32:52,085
Speaker 3:  Right. And especially with ai, it's not just shipping, like

581
00:32:52,645 --> 00:32:55,645
Speaker 3:  shipping. Shipping is the very beginning of the battle of making something

582
00:32:55,645 --> 00:32:57,525
Speaker 3:  that's actually any good when it comes to

583
00:32:57,585 --> 00:33:01,405
Speaker 2:  Ai. And part of it is shipping. I, I know in the 18.1 Beta and You can, You

584
00:33:01,405 --> 00:33:05,365
Speaker 2:  can summarize notifications like no one's business. Have you ever

585
00:33:05,365 --> 00:33:07,845
Speaker 2:  looked at a small piece of information and thought to yourself, I wish this

586
00:33:07,845 --> 00:33:11,405
Speaker 2:  piece of information is smaller. Yeah. Apple's got you. Like that You can

587
00:33:11,405 --> 00:33:15,245
Speaker 2:  do that right now. It's all of the rest of it that isn't out yet that has

588
00:33:15,305 --> 00:33:18,845
Speaker 2:  yet to ship. It's all of this private cloud compute stuff, which is

589
00:33:19,105 --> 00:33:22,725
Speaker 2:  up and running and supporting the beta, but it ha actually hasn't scaled

590
00:33:22,945 --> 00:33:26,805
Speaker 2:  and has not actually yet been audited by third parties to prove that it's

591
00:33:26,925 --> 00:33:30,885
Speaker 2:  compliant with Apple's privacy's like Apple's, privacy promises, all of that

592
00:33:31,265 --> 00:33:34,605
Speaker 2:  we don't know yet. Like we just don't know yet. So I, it's, it's just hard

593
00:33:34,605 --> 00:33:38,365
Speaker 2:  to evaluate this phone. Like from the dumbest perspective

594
00:33:38,425 --> 00:33:42,285
Speaker 2:  of like, should I upgrade a phone? I don't know. Like, is is

595
00:33:42,285 --> 00:33:45,405
Speaker 2:  your phone broken? This phone will be much nicer than the phone you have.

596
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:48,765
Speaker 2:  Will this phone bring you a bunch of cool new AI features? Like I don't Maybe,

597
00:33:49,265 --> 00:33:50,765
Speaker 2:  but I don't know yet. But

598
00:33:50,765 --> 00:33:51,805
Speaker 5:  Your camera will be sick.

599
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:53,885
Speaker 2:  The, the, well,

600
00:33:54,635 --> 00:33:55,805
Speaker 3:  Yeah, we'll see. Well,

601
00:33:55,805 --> 00:33:59,165
Speaker 2:  Yeah, we'll see. It's very hard to evaluate a camera at, at Apple Park.

602
00:33:59,395 --> 00:34:03,205
Speaker 3:  Well, okay, this is actually a good segue back into the, the pros, which

603
00:34:03,205 --> 00:34:06,965
Speaker 3:  we should talk about because obviously there was a ton of focus

604
00:34:07,105 --> 00:34:10,445
Speaker 3:  on the cameras. I mean Right. If you're, if you're buying this thing on day

605
00:34:10,585 --> 00:34:14,445
Speaker 3:  one, the two things you're buying it for hardware wise are the

606
00:34:14,445 --> 00:34:17,605
Speaker 3:  camera upgrades and the camera control. Like, that's, that's it, that's the

607
00:34:17,605 --> 00:34:21,085
Speaker 3:  thing. Right? Unless you like deeply want a phone that is called Desert

608
00:34:21,205 --> 00:34:24,965
Speaker 3:  titanium And. if you, you do, please email me and tell me why.

609
00:34:25,365 --> 00:34:26,605
Speaker 3:  I would love to hear from you because it's called

610
00:34:26,605 --> 00:34:29,765
Speaker 5:  Desert. It sounds cool. It's way better than natural.

611
00:34:30,025 --> 00:34:32,605
Speaker 3:  One of my favorite things that happened today was that as soon as they said

612
00:34:32,605 --> 00:34:36,125
Speaker 3:  Desert Titanium, every single person on our staff with live blog access

613
00:34:36,355 --> 00:34:39,445
Speaker 3:  made a different joke in the live blog Desert Titanium.

614
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:42,885
Speaker 2:  Can I, can I tell you the, the joke that I did not make in the live blog?

615
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:43,245
Speaker 2:  Sure,

616
00:34:43,305 --> 00:34:43,525
Speaker 3:  Yes.

617
00:34:43,745 --> 00:34:47,525
Speaker 2:  Desert Titanium sounds like if one of the mes in Pacific Rim was a stripper

618
00:34:50,305 --> 00:34:51,365
Speaker 3:  And now coming to the

619
00:34:51,365 --> 00:34:52,645
Speaker 2:  Stage. You see what I'm saying?

620
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:55,365
Speaker 5:  Desert titanium

621
00:34:55,905 --> 00:34:59,445
Speaker 2:  CIO del Toro, get with me. I have an entire idea here

622
00:35:01,145 --> 00:35:01,565
Speaker 5:  That's

623
00:35:01,565 --> 00:35:04,845
Speaker 2:  Very good. But I know how we can stop Kai attacks and it's sexy.

624
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:08,805
Speaker 3:  But yeah. With the pros, I'm,

625
00:35:08,805 --> 00:35:11,085
Speaker 2:  That's it. That's it. That's, that's my last VERGE cast to

626
00:35:11,085 --> 00:35:14,805
Speaker 3:  Everybody. That's it. Yeah. That was, we're leaving Neli and Sunnyvale. This

627
00:35:14,805 --> 00:35:18,765
Speaker 3:  is the end possibly of The Verge. Who knows? We're

628
00:35:18,765 --> 00:35:22,205
Speaker 3:  so sorry. but it was always gonna end like this. This is what it was. I'm

629
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:25,845
Speaker 2:  Just gonna point this out. As far as I know, Jagers are not gendered

630
00:35:26,105 --> 00:35:29,645
Speaker 2:  and this is an equal opportunity, like full

631
00:35:30,245 --> 00:35:32,805
Speaker 2:  spectrum stripper robot situation. Beautiful.

632
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:35,085
Speaker 5:  Just pulling their metal plates into the ocean.

633
00:35:36,505 --> 00:35:38,805
Speaker 2:  Get m I'm just trying to be inclusive. Yeah. Love

634
00:35:39,075 --> 00:35:41,805
Speaker 3:  Just throwing metal around 2024. Anyway,

635
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:43,005
Speaker 2:  Desert Titanium,

636
00:35:45,745 --> 00:35:45,965
Speaker 2:  the,

637
00:35:46,425 --> 00:35:50,205
Speaker 3:  The Pro and the Pro Max. It's just the camera this year. Right. Like

638
00:35:50,585 --> 00:35:54,485
Speaker 3:  better, better processor, different colors. Battery life,

639
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:58,125
Speaker 3:  which I'm gonna get very angry about here in a minute. But like the thing,

640
00:35:58,185 --> 00:36:02,125
Speaker 3:  if you're, if you're thinking regular iPhone versus pro iPhone,

641
00:36:02,265 --> 00:36:04,765
Speaker 3:  you're basically making this decision based on the camera. Right.

642
00:36:04,765 --> 00:36:05,525
Speaker 5:  And bigger display.

643
00:36:05,715 --> 00:36:09,325
Speaker 3:  Okay. And bigger display Fair. Granted, which I will say anecdotally it seems

644
00:36:09,325 --> 00:36:12,765
Speaker 3:  like has turned more people off than on just from what I've heard. Seven,

645
00:36:12,765 --> 00:36:12,965
Speaker 3:  seven

646
00:36:13,035 --> 00:36:16,565
Speaker 5:  Inch phone. That's it's big. I mean mean that's not math. Hold on. Almost

647
00:36:16,565 --> 00:36:17,565
Speaker 5:  seven inches of phone.

648
00:36:17,915 --> 00:36:21,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So I mean I held it And. if you hold it without holding the 15 pro

649
00:36:21,325 --> 00:36:24,605
Speaker 2:  max in your hand, you're like, ah, it's manageable. And then you hold them

650
00:36:24,605 --> 00:36:27,125
Speaker 2:  next to each other and you're like, well this phone is big and this phone

651
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:28,605
Speaker 2:  is a surfboard. Oh wow.

652
00:36:28,705 --> 00:36:32,405
Speaker 3:  And you're a max guy. You, so for you to say that is not a big, not small.

653
00:36:32,635 --> 00:36:33,325
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Yeah.

654
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:36,405
Speaker 2:  It's not, it's not anywhere close to a small phone. It's, it's enormous.

655
00:36:37,605 --> 00:36:40,125
Speaker 2:  I love it. I'm gonna, I'm super gonna buy it. Are you, you know, obviously

656
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:43,205
Speaker 2:  some people buy the pro just for a camera, but then people were also going

657
00:36:43,345 --> 00:36:47,165
Speaker 2:  up to the pro max size because it had the better Zoom lens. Right.

658
00:36:47,465 --> 00:36:51,165
Speaker 2:  And now it's the same Zoom lens on both. So you're not being forced into

659
00:36:51,285 --> 00:36:54,445
Speaker 2:  that biggest phone. You can sort of stop at gigantic

660
00:36:55,705 --> 00:36:59,125
Speaker 2:  and still get kind of the, the best camera system. And I, I think the 48

661
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:03,045
Speaker 2:  megapixel ultra wide here is a big deal. It's still the ultra

662
00:37:03,045 --> 00:37:06,885
Speaker 2:  wide. It doesn't capture as much light and it's impossible to like really

663
00:37:07,285 --> 00:37:10,845
Speaker 2:  evaluate iPhone cameras at Apple Park. 'cause it, it's like a beautifully

664
00:37:11,025 --> 00:37:12,285
Speaker 2:  lit space no matter where you

665
00:37:12,285 --> 00:37:13,885
Speaker 5:  Are the best lit place you will ever

666
00:37:14,075 --> 00:37:17,445
Speaker 2:  Like exist. Yeah. It's like angelic light from the heavens just like fuses

667
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:20,965
Speaker 2:  the environment. Right? Yeah. So it's impossible to evaluate. But I took

668
00:37:20,965 --> 00:37:24,485
Speaker 2:  a bunch of photos and obviously the main camera is way better. Obviously

669
00:37:24,485 --> 00:37:27,605
Speaker 2:  the main camera has more modes and all this other stuff and then they, they've,

670
00:37:27,985 --> 00:37:31,685
Speaker 2:  but the having a 48 megapixel ultra means you do get some more detail.

671
00:37:31,945 --> 00:37:35,565
Speaker 2:  You get, you know, it, it's just a better camera than the old ultra wide.

672
00:37:35,745 --> 00:37:38,645
Speaker 2:  And I actually use the Ultra a lot. So I'm pretty excited about it.

673
00:37:38,955 --> 00:37:40,205
Speaker 3:  What do you use the ultra wide for?

674
00:37:40,585 --> 00:37:44,365
Speaker 2:  I'm just often in a space where it's like, I wanna take a picture of Max

675
00:37:44,385 --> 00:37:48,165
Speaker 2:  and I wanna capture the environment that I'm in with Max. Yep. Like here's

676
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:51,765
Speaker 2:  the whole playground. And like that's a useful, it's just a useful tool.

677
00:37:51,985 --> 00:37:55,005
Speaker 3:  That's exactly my experience, which is why I asked it is constantly like

678
00:37:55,045 --> 00:37:58,885
Speaker 3:  I can either get like the, the shoulders up shot or I can use

679
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:02,525
Speaker 3:  the ultra wide. So that for me is, it's exactly the same thing. Yeah. But

680
00:38:02,525 --> 00:38:06,165
Speaker 3:  I think for the, the pro, like the reason I, I brought this up when we started

681
00:38:06,165 --> 00:38:10,005
Speaker 3:  talking about the camera thing is the, a big part of the keynote was about

682
00:38:10,185 --> 00:38:14,125
Speaker 3:  all of these new camera modes and all the different ways You can

683
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,565
Speaker 3:  shoot. And the fact that natural is just like a mode now

684
00:38:17,945 --> 00:38:20,805
Speaker 3:  is, is deeply fascinating to me that they're like You can shoot a thousand

685
00:38:20,805 --> 00:38:24,245
Speaker 3:  ways. One of them is regular and and here's a bunch of other ones.

686
00:38:24,585 --> 00:38:27,365
Speaker 3:  And I just feel like, like obviously Nila, you were in the room so you saw

687
00:38:27,365 --> 00:38:31,245
Speaker 3:  this stuff on the screen, which is always hit and miss Everything always

688
00:38:31,245 --> 00:38:34,365
Speaker 3:  looks great on the screen. Has been my experience. But also like, took some

689
00:38:34,365 --> 00:38:37,765
Speaker 3:  pictures and saw 'em on the screen. Like what, what do you make of

690
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:41,725
Speaker 3:  Apple's sort of million new ideas about photo processing here?

691
00:38:41,955 --> 00:38:45,005
Speaker 2:  Well one, lemme tell you two things about the screen. Okay. Something else

692
00:38:45,005 --> 00:38:48,085
Speaker 2:  Phil Sho told me. So again, they built the Steve Jobs theater. They designed

693
00:38:48,085 --> 00:38:51,005
Speaker 2:  it ages ago and he pointed out to me, they built it for projectors.

694
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:55,565
Speaker 2:  Like the room is designed for big projectors and then they wanted to do a

695
00:38:55,565 --> 00:38:59,205
Speaker 2:  big LED screen. 'cause that's what everyone does now. So they had to basically

696
00:38:59,485 --> 00:39:03,405
Speaker 2:  engineer their own screen for the theater and it goes past the wings

697
00:39:03,405 --> 00:39:06,645
Speaker 2:  of the stage. So they, to get Oh, wild. To get the size and shape they wanted.

698
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:09,845
Speaker 2:  That's very apple. And apple designed and engineered their own LED screen,

699
00:39:09,845 --> 00:39:13,645
Speaker 2:  which is hella bright. Let me just tell you. Hella right.

700
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,765
Speaker 2:  The other thing I saw the audio in that room, I, I keep talking about like

701
00:39:16,765 --> 00:39:19,605
Speaker 2:  the room and like it was very cheery in there. It was a little boomy today,

702
00:39:20,065 --> 00:39:23,045
Speaker 2:  unlike other times things were different today at the Steve Jumps.

703
00:39:23,985 --> 00:39:27,565
Speaker 2:  Anyhow. So it's hard to know like

704
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:32,405
Speaker 2:  all the modes. Yeah. Every time I see Apple's camera team, they basically

705
00:39:32,405 --> 00:39:36,285
Speaker 2:  are like, here we go again. That's their attitude.

706
00:39:36,605 --> 00:39:39,445
Speaker 2:  Attitude towards me. Just it when you walk in, no, they're into it all. You

707
00:39:39,445 --> 00:39:42,685
Speaker 2:  all these companies are run by extremely type A individuals who wanna fight.

708
00:39:43,045 --> 00:39:46,725
Speaker 2:  They would just prefer to win. So it's like, I always have these great conversations.

709
00:39:46,725 --> 00:39:50,565
Speaker 2:  It's always super interesting in their point of view now. Which

710
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:53,845
Speaker 2:  again, we have to review the phones, we have to see how true this is. It

711
00:39:53,845 --> 00:39:57,725
Speaker 2:  appears to be that they have realized that people are gonna filter

712
00:39:57,785 --> 00:40:01,725
Speaker 2:  the photos anyway. Hmm. Right. So they're like, look, people have

713
00:40:01,925 --> 00:40:05,205
Speaker 2:  a radically different interpretation of what their own skin tone is and we

714
00:40:05,205 --> 00:40:08,845
Speaker 2:  just have to get out of their way. Like that's not for us to decide anymore.

715
00:40:08,905 --> 00:40:12,445
Speaker 2:  So here's all of these options and here's all of these sliders and

716
00:40:12,615 --> 00:40:16,405
Speaker 2:  photo styles have existed on The iPhone for ages. In fact, they

717
00:40:16,405 --> 00:40:20,285
Speaker 2:  started as a response to the Pixel. 'cause you'll remember back when computational

718
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:23,725
Speaker 2:  photography started and the Pixel team and Mark LaVoy were talking about

719
00:40:23,725 --> 00:40:27,085
Speaker 2:  like, you know, like old painters they liked and

720
00:40:27,275 --> 00:40:31,165
Speaker 2:  shadows and details. The iPhone was like too bright and too even. And we'd

721
00:40:31,165 --> 00:40:34,205
Speaker 2:  be like, we like the pixels contrast. So they added photo styles and one

722
00:40:34,205 --> 00:40:36,165
Speaker 2:  of them was basically like shut up about the pixel,

723
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:41,685
Speaker 2:  but it was destructive so you could shoot in that mode and that was it. And

724
00:40:41,685 --> 00:40:44,965
Speaker 2:  the reason they're making a big deal about it again is they've re-engineered

725
00:40:45,085 --> 00:40:48,765
Speaker 2:  the photo pipeline so You can change it at will after the shot.

726
00:40:48,765 --> 00:40:52,165
Speaker 2:  Right. And so that means You can capture all the stuff and You can do all,

727
00:40:52,735 --> 00:40:56,005
Speaker 2:  don't call 'em filters. You're very careful to say like this kind of photo

728
00:40:56,005 --> 00:40:59,845
Speaker 2:  prop processing dates back to the 18 hundreds, all this stuff. But the

729
00:40:59,845 --> 00:41:03,085
Speaker 2:  idea is you'll be able to get a much more

730
00:41:03,245 --> 00:41:06,965
Speaker 2:  DSLR type photo with like heavy shadows and heavy detail or

731
00:41:07,245 --> 00:41:11,005
Speaker 2:  a much more modern smartphone ultra tone mapped photo where all shadows have

732
00:41:11,005 --> 00:41:13,925
Speaker 2:  been banished from the face of the Earth never to be spoken again. And now

733
00:41:13,925 --> 00:41:17,765
Speaker 2:  those are controls. Are anyone gonna use these controls? I don't know.

734
00:41:18,025 --> 00:41:22,005
Speaker 2:  Do the power of defaults really matter? And does natural on

735
00:41:22,085 --> 00:41:25,765
Speaker 2:  an iPhone still have to stand for something? It does. Can you

736
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:29,605
Speaker 2:  evaluate it inside of the angelic light of the Steve Jobs? You cannot.

737
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:33,765
Speaker 2:  So you have to get it. But I, I think they're starting to see that

738
00:41:33,975 --> 00:41:37,925
Speaker 2:  other, that their users are constantly changing

739
00:41:37,925 --> 00:41:41,885
Speaker 2:  these photos anyway. And so their own point of view has to kind

740
00:41:41,885 --> 00:41:44,805
Speaker 2:  of be a, a good starting plate for all the changes to come.

741
00:41:45,105 --> 00:41:48,485
Speaker 5:  Do you guys use those modes now? 'cause I just realized I've had it set in

742
00:41:48,485 --> 00:41:52,365
Speaker 5:  rich contrast for probably as long as I've had this phone.

743
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:52,805
Speaker 5:  That's

744
00:41:52,805 --> 00:41:53,605
Speaker 2:  That's pixel mode.

745
00:41:53,785 --> 00:41:55,845
Speaker 3:  That's pixel mode. Oh, that's interesting. Yep.

746
00:41:55,955 --> 00:41:57,405
Speaker 5:  I've been in pixel mode for years.

747
00:41:58,085 --> 00:42:01,165
Speaker 3:  I think that's really telling, right? Like I, I the power of defaults is

748
00:42:01,165 --> 00:42:05,045
Speaker 3:  a really real thing here. Yeah. And I think what I wonder about the pro is

749
00:42:05,045 --> 00:42:08,925
Speaker 3:  whether it is more prone to get people who are

750
00:42:08,955 --> 00:42:11,965
Speaker 3:  more likely to be interested in fussing with those things. Obviously at the

751
00:42:11,965 --> 00:42:15,325
Speaker 3:  very top end, like the kind of people who are shooting the

752
00:42:15,475 --> 00:42:19,085
Speaker 3:  4K one 20 stuff and holding it up in a gimbal and like the people Apple likes

753
00:42:19,085 --> 00:42:22,085
Speaker 3:  to show in these keynotes and in their ads. Those are the people who are

754
00:42:22,085 --> 00:42:23,925
Speaker 3:  gonna use these filters. And I think we'll be psyched about it. Right? Like

755
00:42:23,925 --> 00:42:27,765
Speaker 3:  to have more options to do this stuff, quote unquote in

756
00:42:27,765 --> 00:42:31,365
Speaker 3:  camera is great all for it. But I think

757
00:42:31,705 --> 00:42:35,445
Speaker 3:  the, the like interface question of how you surface this stuff for regular

758
00:42:35,545 --> 00:42:38,805
Speaker 3:  people is really fascinating and really hard. And I think

759
00:42:39,395 --> 00:42:41,685
Speaker 3:  it's kind of how I feel about the camera control thing, right? I think most

760
00:42:41,685 --> 00:42:44,405
Speaker 3:  people will figure out that if I smash this button, it will take a picture

761
00:42:44,985 --> 00:42:48,845
Speaker 3:  and everything more nuanced than that, you start to

762
00:42:48,845 --> 00:42:52,685
Speaker 3:  lose some giant percentage of the number of people who are gonna use the

763
00:42:52,685 --> 00:42:53,125
Speaker 3:  phone. That's

764
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:56,605
Speaker 5:  Why I keep thinking about this Apple intelligence. Like, I mean obviously

765
00:42:56,675 --> 00:43:00,405
Speaker 5:  it's very easy to to turn it into the personal assistant for your phone

766
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:04,805
Speaker 5:  settings, but that feels like a a, a win at this point if

767
00:43:04,825 --> 00:43:08,245
Speaker 5:  it really works. That's like the thing you wanna advertise constantly.

768
00:43:08,555 --> 00:43:11,125
Speaker 5:  Tell everybody, look at all these cool settings. It's too hard to remember

769
00:43:11,825 --> 00:43:12,245
Speaker 5:  series.

770
00:43:12,605 --> 00:43:16,445
Speaker 3:  What do you say? Like, make this photo look like the 1980s and if

771
00:43:16,685 --> 00:43:17,845
Speaker 3:  everyone was doing drugs, like

772
00:43:18,235 --> 00:43:21,405
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that's exactly what you say. I say like, I want that creepy

773
00:43:21,825 --> 00:43:23,885
Speaker 5:  2000 digital camera vibe. Right.

774
00:43:23,885 --> 00:43:27,405
Speaker 2:  But do you want that, do you wanna say that before you take the photo or

775
00:43:27,495 --> 00:43:28,725
Speaker 2:  after you take the photo? Well,

776
00:43:28,725 --> 00:43:32,005
Speaker 5:  You can do both now as I understand it with the pro,

777
00:43:33,135 --> 00:43:36,525
Speaker 5:  it'll let you change the style after they, they said that that was a big

778
00:43:36,525 --> 00:43:37,285
Speaker 5:  part of the the thing.

779
00:43:37,385 --> 00:43:41,005
Speaker 2:  It will. But there's, you know, there's just parts of taking a photo. Like

780
00:43:41,115 --> 00:43:44,725
Speaker 2:  Yeah. How long is the exposure? Right? Like, do you want to fire the flash

781
00:43:44,825 --> 00:43:47,725
Speaker 2:  If? you want that indie sleeve look like you might wanna fire the flash.

782
00:43:47,755 --> 00:43:51,285
Speaker 2:  Like there's a lot of steps in between. Make it look like this.

783
00:43:51,755 --> 00:43:54,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And just tell the robot to make it look like this.

784
00:43:54,485 --> 00:43:55,725
Speaker 5:  I want the robot to do all of it.

785
00:43:56,545 --> 00:43:57,325
Speaker 3:  Tobble those too.

786
00:43:57,675 --> 00:43:59,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Well, so if they can do, pull it off

787
00:44:00,025 --> 00:44:04,005
Speaker 2:  To be, to be clear, once again, none of that is shipping

788
00:44:04,005 --> 00:44:07,805
Speaker 2:  yet. And what app, what Alex is describing in particular is just like

789
00:44:07,805 --> 00:44:10,685
Speaker 2:  us dreaming. Yeah. That that's, that's that you'll be able to just like talk

790
00:44:10,685 --> 00:44:11,925
Speaker 2:  to the phone and we'll do stuff. That's

791
00:44:11,925 --> 00:44:15,285
Speaker 3:  My hope. It's also Apple dreaming that is like, we're not making that up.

792
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:16,565
Speaker 3:  That's Apple's idea. Right.

793
00:44:16,565 --> 00:44:19,165
Speaker 2:  And Apple wants to plug third party apps in series. They can do this stuff.

794
00:44:19,495 --> 00:44:23,085
Speaker 2:  We're just nowhere cl like that is all pure vapor. Yeah. That's not even,

795
00:44:23,435 --> 00:44:26,485
Speaker 2:  it's gonna ship in the next version of 18. One that's maybe a year away.

796
00:44:26,865 --> 00:44:30,325
Speaker 2:  And what we have now, right now in the camera, particularly pro camera,

797
00:44:30,745 --> 00:44:34,245
Speaker 2:  is infinite customizability. So If, you know what you want,

798
00:44:34,545 --> 00:44:38,285
Speaker 2:  the camera can now get way closer to delivering it. And

799
00:44:38,355 --> 00:44:42,125
Speaker 2:  that is different than are the photos by default more realistic

800
00:44:42,225 --> 00:44:46,085
Speaker 2:  or less over processed? We just don't know. But the idea that it, the

801
00:44:46,085 --> 00:44:49,205
Speaker 2:  camera is now infinitely more flexible in the pro model

802
00:44:49,985 --> 00:44:53,925
Speaker 2:  is, I I think it's born out by just the number of controls you have and

803
00:44:53,925 --> 00:44:55,885
Speaker 2:  the fact that most of the pipelines aren't destructive anymore.

804
00:44:56,275 --> 00:44:59,405
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Yeah. Which I think is very cool. Alright, we need to take a break.

805
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:02,925
Speaker 3:  We've been talking about camera buttons for way too long. Any

806
00:45:02,925 --> 00:45:05,965
Speaker 3:  parting thoughts on, on the iPhones? Neela, you've, you've held all the things.

807
00:45:07,245 --> 00:45:09,405
Speaker 3:  Anything that jumped out to you before we stopped talking about phones?

808
00:45:10,705 --> 00:45:14,645
Speaker 2:  The, the promax is really big and all of the phones are really nice in

809
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:16,365
Speaker 2:  a way that I don't think has been a,

810
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,645
Speaker 3:  I think this is like iPhone five. Nice. Like peak iPhone nice.

811
00:45:21,265 --> 00:45:25,125
Speaker 2:  No, but they are, they're the most refined versions of

812
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:29,005
Speaker 2:  this design I've seen in, in quite a while. And I, I honestly think

813
00:45:29,005 --> 00:45:32,045
Speaker 2:  the sixteenths, once they get some of the features, they're, they, they'll

814
00:45:32,045 --> 00:45:33,085
Speaker 2:  move like people will buy 'em.

815
00:45:33,515 --> 00:45:36,005
Speaker 3:  Okay. That's very exciting. All right, we gotta take a break. We'll be right

816
00:45:36,005 --> 00:45:36,165
Speaker 3:  back.

817
00:46:42,665 --> 00:46:46,565
Speaker 3:  All right, we're back. We've had the ad break to think. Any, any more

818
00:46:46,565 --> 00:46:49,245
Speaker 3:  phone thoughts? Everybody feel good? I didn't yell about the battery life,

819
00:46:49,245 --> 00:46:51,885
Speaker 3:  but I'm gonna, I'm gonna not yell about the battery life. You, you, you'll

820
00:46:51,885 --> 00:46:52,125
Speaker 3:  have time.

821
00:46:52,235 --> 00:46:54,525
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I feel like we need to, we need to talk about the processor and the

822
00:46:54,525 --> 00:46:56,645
Speaker 2:  battery life. So they, they kept saying it was the best battery life ever

823
00:46:56,645 --> 00:46:58,365
Speaker 2:  without a number. Yeah.

824
00:46:58,635 --> 00:47:01,765
Speaker 3:  Just the best. And they did the, the one that really killed me was there

825
00:47:01,765 --> 00:47:04,645
Speaker 3:  was a moment during the keynote where there was a slide in which they showed

826
00:47:04,645 --> 00:47:08,085
Speaker 3:  the battery meter with the green and then just extended it so there was more

827
00:47:08,085 --> 00:47:11,885
Speaker 3:  green. That doesn't mean anything. What, what am I supposed to do with that?

828
00:47:12,225 --> 00:47:15,685
Speaker 3:  Oh, good. You made the icon longer. Congratulations. That accomplished. I'm

829
00:47:15,685 --> 00:47:19,605
Speaker 3:  so angry at how many times they said battery life. Without giving any actual

830
00:47:19,605 --> 00:47:20,645
Speaker 3:  information about battery life.

831
00:47:21,025 --> 00:47:24,325
Speaker 2:  So, I think distrust them. The 16 Pro Max is supposed to the best battery

832
00:47:24,325 --> 00:47:28,125
Speaker 2:  life ever on iPhone. I'll say my 15 Pro max has garbage battery

833
00:47:28,125 --> 00:47:32,045
Speaker 2:  life. It is, it is absolutely abhorrent. Like it is

834
00:47:32,045 --> 00:47:32,845
Speaker 2:  just bad. So

835
00:47:32,945 --> 00:47:36,285
Speaker 3:  My 15 has deteriorated faster than any iPhone I've ever used.

836
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,845
Speaker 2:  I haven't even looked at the deterioration. I'm just like, oh, it's the middle

837
00:47:38,845 --> 00:47:41,725
Speaker 2:  of the day. I should charge my phone. Ooh. Ooh. That's where I'm, that's

838
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:42,325
Speaker 2:  where I'm this,

839
00:47:42,325 --> 00:47:42,685
Speaker 3:  That's tough.

840
00:47:42,685 --> 00:47:46,525
Speaker 2:  That's what's not good. But I, the, the, the stats as far as I can tell,

841
00:47:46,915 --> 00:47:50,845
Speaker 2:  what they're talking about is hours of video playback as a proxy for everything

842
00:47:50,845 --> 00:47:54,605
Speaker 2:  else. They just don't want to be like 33 hours of video

843
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:55,725
Speaker 2:  playback on a slide.

844
00:47:57,185 --> 00:47:59,805
Speaker 3:  We spent a bunch of time last week talking about how stupid a metric that

845
00:47:59,805 --> 00:48:01,165
Speaker 3:  is. So whatever, we can move on.

846
00:48:01,975 --> 00:48:03,765
Speaker 5:  We'll talk about it next week. I frequently

847
00:48:03,765 --> 00:48:07,405
Speaker 3:  Watched or week after, dozens of hours of consecutive offline video on my

848
00:48:07,405 --> 00:48:09,245
Speaker 3:  phone. Do you guys not? Yeah. Is that, yeah. That's not

849
00:48:09,245 --> 00:48:13,125
Speaker 2:  What people do. It's hyper optimized video playback engine. Yeah. Amazing.

850
00:48:13,665 --> 00:48:15,365
Speaker 3:  So you wanted to say something about the processor?

851
00:48:15,545 --> 00:48:19,325
Speaker 2:  The processor, speaking of ultra optimized video playback engines, a lot

852
00:48:19,325 --> 00:48:22,765
Speaker 2:  of our commenters have noticed that the processor

853
00:48:22,845 --> 00:48:26,525
Speaker 2:  upgrades on the phone made for AI don't amount to much

854
00:48:27,075 --> 00:48:30,485
Speaker 2:  like you actually still get, it's like 35 flops, right? Is the,

855
00:48:31,065 --> 00:48:34,365
Speaker 2:  the thing. And that's what you get like the end,

856
00:48:34,865 --> 00:48:37,085
Speaker 5:  But on a phone. Ooh.

857
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:42,685
Speaker 2:  Well, sure. But that's the same as like last year. Yeah. So I it. I I think

858
00:48:42,685 --> 00:48:46,325
Speaker 2:  the made for AI claims are kind of like running right up against the

859
00:48:46,325 --> 00:48:47,005
Speaker 2:  reality of

860
00:48:47,595 --> 00:48:48,085
Speaker 5:  Reality

861
00:48:48,085 --> 00:48:52,005
Speaker 2:  Phone development times. And I, I think mostly what they've done is just

862
00:48:52,005 --> 00:48:53,805
Speaker 2:  put a bunch of ram in all these phones. Yeah.

863
00:48:53,815 --> 00:48:54,565
Speaker 5:  Eight gigs.

864
00:48:55,155 --> 00:48:55,445
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

865
00:48:56,135 --> 00:48:56,885
Speaker 5:  Which is they loaded

866
00:48:57,085 --> 00:49:00,085
Speaker 3:  'em up, which is great. Like terrific more Ram is a good thing.

867
00:49:00,355 --> 00:49:04,045
Speaker 5:  They're not each $400 more because Apple put more ram in them is really

868
00:49:04,045 --> 00:49:04,405
Speaker 5:  impressive.

869
00:49:04,405 --> 00:49:08,325
Speaker 3:  Seriously. Yeah. But no, i i, to some extent, the processor

870
00:49:08,325 --> 00:49:12,285
Speaker 3:  thing I think is, is whatever, right? Like, I, I think you're right that

871
00:49:12,285 --> 00:49:15,885
Speaker 3:  If you were going to make like an AI phone that wanted to do all this

872
00:49:16,145 --> 00:49:20,085
Speaker 3:  vastly complicated stuff offline and locally and be awesome.

873
00:49:20,955 --> 00:49:24,925
Speaker 3:  Fine. But like what you have in the a 18 is going to

874
00:49:25,025 --> 00:49:28,805
Speaker 3:  do the job of writing business emails for you perfectly

875
00:49:28,805 --> 00:49:32,685
Speaker 3:  fine. Like we, the, the ceiling of interesting AI

876
00:49:32,965 --> 00:49:36,445
Speaker 3:  features right now is still so much lower on a device like this than the

877
00:49:36,445 --> 00:49:40,045
Speaker 3:  performance ceiling of the device that I'm just not

878
00:49:40,445 --> 00:49:41,005
Speaker 3:  bothered by this.

879
00:49:41,235 --> 00:49:44,845
Speaker 5:  Just you Wait, David, it's gonna write the most beautiful email. I

880
00:49:44,845 --> 00:49:48,645
Speaker 3:  Hope I'm wrong. Like someday in 2036 when Apple Intelligence

881
00:49:48,965 --> 00:49:52,765
Speaker 3:  actually ships, maybe it'll be amazing. Everything changes really fast. Who

882
00:49:52,765 --> 00:49:53,205
Speaker 3:  knows? It's

883
00:49:53,205 --> 00:49:57,005
Speaker 5:  Gonna be an email that makes you weep. You're gonna be like, how

884
00:49:57,005 --> 00:49:59,645
Speaker 5:  could it, no human could write this. It's too pretty.

885
00:49:59,865 --> 00:50:03,325
Speaker 3:  The thing is I'll never see it. My, my Apple mail will just summarize it

886
00:50:03,325 --> 00:50:06,085
Speaker 3:  for me. I'll never even see it. It's no problems.

887
00:50:06,625 --> 00:50:10,605
Speaker 5:  And that summary will also be beautiful. But we should talk about, we should

888
00:50:10,605 --> 00:50:11,925
Speaker 5:  talk about these AirPods, right? Yeah. Let's

889
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,445
Speaker 3:  Talk AirPods. This was the

890
00:50:13,445 --> 00:50:13,525
Speaker 5:  Most

891
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:16,645
Speaker 3:  Exciting, I think this was the coolest part of the whole this talking about,

892
00:50:16,785 --> 00:50:20,005
Speaker 3:  was it? I was about to say it was three AirPods. I think it was four AirPods.

893
00:50:20,315 --> 00:50:21,845
Speaker 3:  Will you, will you run this down for us?

894
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:26,365
Speaker 5:  Well, so yes. Like Yeah. It's four technically. I think

895
00:50:26,365 --> 00:50:28,365
Speaker 5:  it's four. It is four. Well, three.

896
00:50:28,755 --> 00:50:29,565
Speaker 3:  It's like three and a

897
00:50:29,565 --> 00:50:31,925
Speaker 5:  Half. Yeah, we'll go three and a half. We'll go three and a half. Okay. So

898
00:50:31,925 --> 00:50:35,725
Speaker 5:  there's the AirPods four, it's two and You can, they're two flat. No,

899
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:38,645
Speaker 5:  you we'll get there. We're doing Apple map. It's, it's, it's at least if

900
00:50:38,645 --> 00:50:39,445
Speaker 5:  they think can have four lenses,

901
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:40,485
Speaker 3:  It might be six or seven.

902
00:50:41,215 --> 00:50:43,165
Speaker 5:  We'll see. We're just gonna keep adding It's two.

903
00:50:43,905 --> 00:50:45,005
Speaker 2:  All right, go ahead. Okay.

904
00:50:45,065 --> 00:50:48,605
Speaker 5:  So they're the AirPods four and there are, Lia is correct. Two

905
00:50:48,605 --> 00:50:52,165
Speaker 5:  versions of them. There's one that's like $129

906
00:50:52,785 --> 00:50:56,405
Speaker 5:  and it's got, you know, it's the new shape and, and all of that stuff.

907
00:50:56,705 --> 00:51:00,605
Speaker 5:  And then there's one that's $179 and that's also got active noise

908
00:51:00,605 --> 00:51:04,445
Speaker 5:  canceling in it. And in both cases there'll be head

909
00:51:04,445 --> 00:51:08,205
Speaker 5:  shake to respond to Siri. I believe the personalized facial

910
00:51:08,295 --> 00:51:12,165
Speaker 5:  audio, is that in both? I'm pretty sure. Yeah. The H two chip is gonna

911
00:51:12,165 --> 00:51:15,205
Speaker 5:  be in both USBC charging case

912
00:51:15,785 --> 00:51:19,525
Speaker 5:  30 hours of battery life. The, the, the battery

913
00:51:19,525 --> 00:51:23,245
Speaker 5:  case is gonna have a little speaker in it so it'll beep beep when you lose

914
00:51:23,245 --> 00:51:27,165
Speaker 5:  it. Which has been hugely helpful with my pros. They rule

915
00:51:27,235 --> 00:51:31,125
Speaker 5:  like these are just, these are really good AirPods. And then

916
00:51:31,315 --> 00:51:34,925
Speaker 5:  just 'cause I have to prove that there's four updates. There's the AirPods

917
00:51:35,545 --> 00:51:39,405
Speaker 5:  max, which are still just $549. That didn't

918
00:51:39,405 --> 00:51:42,965
Speaker 5:  change. But now we get some more colors and You can charge 'em with

919
00:51:43,005 --> 00:51:46,365
Speaker 5:  USBC. You don't have to care about your lightning cable. So technically

920
00:51:47,305 --> 00:51:48,245
Speaker 5:  new AirPod max

921
00:51:48,665 --> 00:51:52,525
Speaker 3:  And just right there, you talked about it longer than Apple did during Keynote.

922
00:51:52,685 --> 00:51:53,605
Speaker 5:  I did. Thank you.

923
00:51:53,865 --> 00:51:56,805
Speaker 3:  It, it was like somebody at Apple was being held hostage until they mentioned

924
00:51:56,805 --> 00:51:59,925
Speaker 3:  the Air Pod Max. Did you list the colors? It was so bizarre. They were like

925
00:51:59,925 --> 00:52:01,205
Speaker 3:  new colors USBC moving up.

926
00:52:02,315 --> 00:52:05,285
Speaker 2:  Okay. They also were like, it's still $549.

927
00:52:06,405 --> 00:52:08,805
Speaker 2:  I don't, the AirPods Maxs are absolutely not a new product.

928
00:52:10,305 --> 00:52:12,845
Speaker 2:  usc, they changed the connector. They should have had a year and a half ago,

929
00:52:12,985 --> 00:52:16,245
Speaker 2:  if not more. If they may two colors. It's the same. We're gonna get 'em the

930
00:52:16,245 --> 00:52:19,405
Speaker 2:  app watch. Same with the Apple Watch Ultra too. We're like, here's a video

931
00:52:19,405 --> 00:52:20,525
Speaker 2:  about how it's black now.

932
00:52:22,985 --> 00:52:23,205
Speaker 2:  It

933
00:52:23,275 --> 00:52:23,805
Speaker 5:  Sure is.

934
00:52:24,485 --> 00:52:28,245
Speaker 3:  I I almost wrote in the live blog when there's a long sweeping shot of

935
00:52:28,385 --> 00:52:31,485
Speaker 3:  the watch band. You know, there's nothing else to tell you. But anyway, so

936
00:52:31,485 --> 00:52:34,125
Speaker 3:  wait, Chris, did you talk about the, the AirPods pros? No. No. And

937
00:52:34,125 --> 00:52:37,805
Speaker 5:  Then this is our fourth set of AirPods. Yeah. The fourth one is The AirPods

938
00:52:37,805 --> 00:52:41,765
Speaker 5:  Pro two, which will not change in

939
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:45,685
Speaker 5:  any reasonable way, but they, they're new because they're getting

940
00:52:45,995 --> 00:52:47,365
Speaker 5:  hearing aid features.

941
00:52:48,675 --> 00:52:50,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's cool. New

942
00:52:50,325 --> 00:52:51,325
Speaker 5:  Feature. That means a whole new

943
00:52:51,805 --> 00:52:52,205
Speaker 2:  Audience that

944
00:52:52,205 --> 00:52:53,245
Speaker 5:  Is basically due,

945
00:52:53,475 --> 00:52:56,805
Speaker 2:  That is the single most important aspect of this entire event. But that is

946
00:52:57,025 --> 00:53:01,005
Speaker 2:  not new AirPods. I just wanna be that. It's, they announced two

947
00:53:01,005 --> 00:53:04,165
Speaker 2:  new AirPods and some software features of

948
00:53:04,885 --> 00:53:05,765
Speaker 2:  monumental importance.

949
00:53:06,345 --> 00:53:10,325
Speaker 3:  Can I just admit something right now on this show? I didn't realize until

950
00:53:10,325 --> 00:53:13,285
Speaker 3:  right now that it was just a software update. I thought there had to be something

951
00:53:13,285 --> 00:53:15,765
Speaker 3:  new in the hardware. If you're gonna tell me about how this is a hearing

952
00:53:15,765 --> 00:53:17,845
Speaker 3:  aid. You're telling me this is just a software record?

953
00:53:17,845 --> 00:53:18,965
Speaker 5:  It's the same. It's just software. A

954
00:53:19,085 --> 00:53:21,685
Speaker 3:  Software record software. So if I have existing AirPods Pros, they're gonna

955
00:53:21,685 --> 00:53:22,645
Speaker 3:  get these two. They have

956
00:53:22,645 --> 00:53:23,045
Speaker 5:  To be the two.

957
00:53:23,115 --> 00:53:26,525
Speaker 2:  Yeah, you need the AirPods two, AirPod AirPods Pro two,

958
00:53:27,115 --> 00:53:29,285
Speaker 2:  AirPods two Pro two Pro two series

959
00:53:29,285 --> 00:53:29,605
Speaker 5:  AirPods

960
00:53:29,605 --> 00:53:30,605
Speaker 3:  Pro two Attorneys General.

961
00:53:32,425 --> 00:53:34,925
Speaker 2:  You need the H two chip. So you need the, you need the second generation

962
00:53:34,925 --> 00:53:38,125
Speaker 2:  AirPods Pro. and then you need a phone that can run iOS 18.

963
00:53:38,825 --> 00:53:42,125
Speaker 2:  So there's some cutoff on what phone you have. Sure. But If, you have those

964
00:53:42,145 --> 00:53:45,885
Speaker 2:  two things. You can take the hearing test, which which will,

965
00:53:46,145 --> 00:53:49,565
Speaker 2:  you know, apple has to finish its FD clearance. But they, they say they're

966
00:53:49,565 --> 00:53:52,965
Speaker 2:  gonna do it and then they can act as hearing aids for the same battery life

967
00:53:52,985 --> 00:53:54,885
Speaker 2:  as as they get now about six hours.

968
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:59,245
Speaker 5:  I mean, you, you did the, the f like I'd be remiss if I didn't point out

969
00:53:59,485 --> 00:54:01,925
Speaker 5:  FDA clearance is in fact a thing. They have to still get,

970
00:54:02,475 --> 00:54:04,645
Speaker 2:  They have to still get it. They haven't gotten it yet. Yeah, they, they,

971
00:54:04,645 --> 00:54:07,405
Speaker 2:  they say they're gonna get it around the, around the world as well. They're

972
00:54:07,405 --> 00:54:10,885
Speaker 2:  also very careful with the language. They're not hearing aids. They have

973
00:54:10,925 --> 00:54:12,685
Speaker 2:  a certified hearing aids functionality,

974
00:54:12,895 --> 00:54:16,885
Speaker 5:  Which there's a lot of hearing aids now that work kind of

975
00:54:16,885 --> 00:54:20,645
Speaker 5:  like AirPods. So this feels like a huge deal.

976
00:54:20,935 --> 00:54:24,005
Speaker 2:  Again, I I I, I think I've told this story in the British ask before, but

977
00:54:24,005 --> 00:54:27,885
Speaker 2:  I'll tell it again. The only thing that our government of old people

978
00:54:27,885 --> 00:54:31,445
Speaker 2:  accomplished in the Trump administration is they all got together and passed

979
00:54:31,445 --> 00:54:35,285
Speaker 2:  bipartisan legislation that Trump signed to make hearing aids

980
00:54:35,285 --> 00:54:38,245
Speaker 2:  legal over the counter. Yeah. Because they were all a million years old.

981
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:42,605
Speaker 2:  Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump were

982
00:54:42,605 --> 00:54:45,725
Speaker 2:  like, yeah, yeah, we should make hearing aids easier to get. 'cause we're

983
00:54:45,725 --> 00:54:46,965
Speaker 2:  all a billion years old.

984
00:54:47,345 --> 00:54:48,205
Speaker 5:  We can't hear shit.

985
00:54:48,465 --> 00:54:52,405
Speaker 2:  It was, it's a, a triumph of bipartisanship that would, they

986
00:54:52,405 --> 00:54:54,765
Speaker 2:  passed a lot making hearing aids available over the counter in this way.

987
00:54:55,155 --> 00:54:58,805
Speaker 2:  Sony has them, Bose has 'em. A bunch of other companies sprung up. Bose entered

988
00:54:58,805 --> 00:55:01,205
Speaker 2:  the space and they left the space. They came back in with a partner. 'cause

989
00:55:01,205 --> 00:55:04,125
Speaker 2:  they're complicated. I sort of asked about this with Apple Apple's attitude

990
00:55:04,145 --> 00:55:07,365
Speaker 2:  is like, it's not that complicated for us. 'cause we're Apple and then also

991
00:55:08,085 --> 00:55:12,005
Speaker 2:  fascinatingly, their belief is that because they're AirPods

992
00:55:12,005 --> 00:55:14,765
Speaker 2:  they'll be more socially acceptable than hearing aids.

993
00:55:15,205 --> 00:55:18,845
Speaker 3:  I believe that a hundred percent. I think that is by far the most exciting

994
00:55:18,845 --> 00:55:22,765
Speaker 3:  thing about this is like we, we were debating this in the, in the

995
00:55:22,765 --> 00:55:26,485
Speaker 3:  newsroom today, but like we have long since reached the point

996
00:55:26,495 --> 00:55:30,085
Speaker 3:  where just having one AirPod in all the time is completely

997
00:55:30,565 --> 00:55:34,365
Speaker 3:  socially normal and acceptable. Right. Like I, it's You can feel about it

998
00:55:34,365 --> 00:55:36,845
Speaker 3:  however you want, but like that it's just a fact. That's where we world.

999
00:55:36,845 --> 00:55:36,885
Speaker 3:  No,

1000
00:55:36,885 --> 00:55:37,365
Speaker 5:  No, I

1001
00:55:37,365 --> 00:55:40,125
Speaker 3:  Agree with you. Like one of my favorite things is to see couples walking

1002
00:55:40,125 --> 00:55:43,365
Speaker 3:  down the street, holding hands, talking to each other, each with like the

1003
00:55:43,765 --> 00:55:47,605
Speaker 3:  opposite AirPod in like it's just life now people do it. And

1004
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:48,645
Speaker 3:  I the fact that

1005
00:55:49,105 --> 00:55:51,565
Speaker 2:  Is this something you see couples do or is this something you do in your

1006
00:55:51,565 --> 00:55:52,365
Speaker 2:  relationship? I

1007
00:55:52,365 --> 00:55:54,125
Speaker 5:  Was, I was like, David, I've never seen this.

1008
00:55:54,565 --> 00:55:57,805
Speaker 3:  I would never, I see people doing this all the time. You need to go outside

1009
00:55:57,805 --> 00:56:00,165
Speaker 3:  more often. Cramp. I don't know what people do in New Jersey.

1010
00:56:00,805 --> 00:56:02,845
Speaker 5:  I was like, apparently they don't hear that in Jersey.

1011
00:56:04,745 --> 00:56:08,125
Speaker 3:  But No, but I think the idea, there are lots of interesting questions about,

1012
00:56:08,155 --> 00:56:09,085
Speaker 3:  like, I just wanna

1013
00:56:09,085 --> 00:56:12,245
Speaker 2:  Point out that David lives in Washington DC home of an infinite variety of

1014
00:56:12,245 --> 00:56:15,365
Speaker 2:  government lawyers and contractors. and it sort of makes sense that they've

1015
00:56:15,365 --> 00:56:17,565
Speaker 2:  all replaced Blackberry hand with AirPod ear.

1016
00:56:17,965 --> 00:56:21,205
Speaker 3:  A hundred percent. A hundred percent. DC was definitely like the last vestige

1017
00:56:21,205 --> 00:56:24,805
Speaker 3:  of the huge Bluetooth headset. And they just like, they went straight into

1018
00:56:24,805 --> 00:56:27,165
Speaker 3:  wearing AirPods on Hinge dance. It's like, that's just, it's it's,

1019
00:56:27,165 --> 00:56:30,885
Speaker 2:  It's an election year and everyone's got one AirPod in is like what David

1020
00:56:30,905 --> 00:56:31,965
Speaker 2:  is describing. Alright.

1021
00:56:32,475 --> 00:56:36,045
Speaker 3:  It's just Ezra Klein talking to every single person in Washington

1022
00:56:36,305 --> 00:56:39,045
Speaker 3:  DC all at the same time. That's just

1023
00:56:39,045 --> 00:56:40,765
Speaker 2:  What it is. That's not wrong. Yeah. Makes sense.

1024
00:56:40,765 --> 00:56:44,525
Speaker 3:  No, it's, it's you, me and Ezra on a date together at all times. That's great.

1025
00:56:46,225 --> 00:56:50,005
Speaker 3:  But, but no, I think the fact that no one would look at you twice for wearing

1026
00:56:50,025 --> 00:56:53,445
Speaker 3:  an AirPod in a coffee shop is like a huge part of the reason. This is incredibly

1027
00:56:53,445 --> 00:56:55,205
Speaker 3:  compelling. I think it's so cool. But

1028
00:56:55,205 --> 00:56:59,005
Speaker 5:  Does this mean that now people are just, I mean people are just gonna talk

1029
00:56:59,005 --> 00:57:01,725
Speaker 5:  to you when you have your AirPods in like before it was like a universal

1030
00:57:01,725 --> 00:57:04,765
Speaker 5:  sign of don't talk to me. Yes. And now it's gonna be like, I'll talk to you.

1031
00:57:04,795 --> 00:57:05,925
Speaker 5:  That might be a hearing aid.

1032
00:57:06,345 --> 00:57:09,725
Speaker 2:  If, you zoom out. Apple pitched a pretty weird vision

1033
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:14,165
Speaker 2:  of reality today where you are always wearing

1034
00:57:14,395 --> 00:57:14,885
Speaker 2:  AirPods.

1035
00:57:15,315 --> 00:57:17,845
Speaker 3:  This is what I'm saying. I don't think that's a vision. I think that's reality.

1036
00:57:18,025 --> 00:57:18,245
Speaker 3:  No,

1037
00:57:18,245 --> 00:57:22,205
Speaker 2:  But like you're wearing them at, at a concert, you're wearing them to prevent

1038
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:25,845
Speaker 2:  hearing loss. You're in adaptive mode all the time where like on your job

1039
00:57:25,995 --> 00:57:29,005
Speaker 2:  site, all of your hearing is being modulated through AirPods. Like

1040
00:57:29,515 --> 00:57:33,445
Speaker 2:  they're just prosthetics. Fine. And then I,

1041
00:57:34,505 --> 00:57:38,485
Speaker 2:  not to get too in the weeds of weirdness, apple also makes the

1042
00:57:38,485 --> 00:57:42,365
Speaker 2:  Vision Pro, which wants to mediate your site. And after a

1043
00:57:42,365 --> 00:57:46,325
Speaker 2:  while you're just like, Tim Cook is building a helmet and you're gonna go

1044
00:57:46,325 --> 00:57:50,085
Speaker 2:  in the helmet and Apple's gonna manage the world for you and like clean it

1045
00:57:50,085 --> 00:57:53,885
Speaker 2:  up for you. And that is a weird vision of the future. But the amount of

1046
00:57:54,025 --> 00:57:58,005
Speaker 2:  let, let us put a computer in between you and reality is very high in Apple

1047
00:57:58,005 --> 00:58:01,805
Speaker 2:  world right now. That said, and you know, You can feel about wearing

1048
00:58:01,805 --> 00:58:02,485
Speaker 2:  AirPods. Isn't

1049
00:58:02,485 --> 00:58:03,765
Speaker 5:  That a whole episode of Black Mirror

1050
00:58:04,305 --> 00:58:07,285
Speaker 2:  Too? It's Tim Cook builds a helmet. It's a great episode of Black Mirror.

1051
00:58:10,545 --> 00:58:14,525
Speaker 2:  All that is to say maybe that's awful. Hit regular people in, in different

1052
00:58:14,525 --> 00:58:18,285
Speaker 2:  ways. The actual hearing aid functionality. If they can get

1053
00:58:18,635 --> 00:58:22,405
Speaker 2:  more people to take real hearing tests and then wear hearing

1054
00:58:22,405 --> 00:58:25,845
Speaker 2:  aids, they will do a great service to the world. Like this is very exciting.

1055
00:58:25,845 --> 00:58:28,325
Speaker 2:  And all those competitor hearing aids I was talking about from Sony and Bose

1056
00:58:28,325 --> 00:58:30,245
Speaker 2:  and all these other companies, a thousand dollars.

1057
00:58:30,995 --> 00:58:33,605
Speaker 5:  Yeah, no, this could change my Thanksgiving. And

1058
00:58:33,605 --> 00:58:37,005
Speaker 2:  They, and they have like bad apps and weird features and all this other stuff.

1059
00:58:37,515 --> 00:58:41,005
Speaker 2:  This is what AirPod pros are two 50, right.

1060
00:58:41,505 --> 00:58:45,365
Speaker 2:  250 bucks and the hearing test is built into the OS and it is perfectly tuned.

1061
00:58:45,905 --> 00:58:48,605
Speaker 2:  And you might have, might not have the weird social acceptability problems

1062
00:58:49,035 --> 00:58:53,005
Speaker 2:  that that's a very meaningful, again, i I think it's probably

1063
00:58:53,005 --> 00:58:55,725
Speaker 2:  the biggest announcement I made today on, on in the scale of things.

1064
00:58:56,195 --> 00:58:59,805
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I agree. And the fact that you take that hearing test and not only

1065
00:58:59,805 --> 00:59:03,645
Speaker 3:  does it tune the hearing aid stuff, but it tunes everything else in the

1066
00:59:03,715 --> 00:59:07,645
Speaker 3:  AirPods to you I think is very cool. Yeah. Like Apple has clearly

1067
00:59:07,645 --> 00:59:10,725
Speaker 3:  kind of gone all the way down this road watching them talk about it. It made

1068
00:59:10,725 --> 00:59:13,205
Speaker 3:  me think about the stuff that they did for the Vision Pro, which is like,

1069
00:59:13,825 --> 00:59:17,365
Speaker 3:  you have to do an incredible amount of work because of the affordances of

1070
00:59:17,365 --> 00:59:21,045
Speaker 3:  like the human body. So they had to like invent this new way to scan

1071
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:24,725
Speaker 3:  your face to do it and created this whole crazy pipeline just to get the

1072
00:59:24,725 --> 00:59:28,645
Speaker 3:  thing to work on your face. For some reason, this feels like it's

1073
00:59:28,645 --> 00:59:32,285
Speaker 3:  in service of like a much cooler, more real thing for people. Which I, I

1074
00:59:32,285 --> 00:59:32,765
Speaker 3:  agree. I think it's

1075
00:59:32,925 --> 00:59:35,125
Speaker 5:  Possible. But they, they, they've done this before too. Like, like the, the

1076
00:59:35,125 --> 00:59:38,285
Speaker 5:  bit where it's supposed to modulate the hearing and stuff. They've done that

1077
00:59:38,705 --> 00:59:42,485
Speaker 5:  before. Like that's an accessibility feature now I think where You can put

1078
00:59:42,485 --> 00:59:44,045
Speaker 5:  it in, it'll do a hearing test. Yeah.

1079
00:59:44,075 --> 00:59:48,005
Speaker 2:  They've had the voice captions, they've had transparency mode. They've

1080
00:59:48,005 --> 00:59:51,965
Speaker 2:  had live listen, they've done a lot of stuff that walks right

1081
00:59:51,965 --> 00:59:55,805
Speaker 2:  up to this line. Yeah. This is just over the line. Like the

1082
00:59:56,045 --> 00:59:59,885
Speaker 2:  FDA is gonna tell people these are hearing aid features and mean it and that

1083
01:00:00,005 --> 01:00:03,805
Speaker 2:  I think is it at 250 bucks it's just vastly

1084
01:00:03,805 --> 01:00:06,205
Speaker 2:  more accessible for so many people.

1085
01:00:06,435 --> 01:00:10,365
Speaker 5:  Well I'm just curious the quality of it because some

1086
01:00:10,365 --> 01:00:12,725
Speaker 5:  of those changes they've done before, like I've messed with those accessibility

1087
01:00:13,005 --> 01:00:16,285
Speaker 5:  features and they're not that great. Like the one where it's supposed to

1088
01:00:16,405 --> 01:00:19,365
Speaker 5:  do kind of a little hearing test and and and be like, we're gonna make the

1089
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:20,965
Speaker 5:  sound even better for your ears.

1090
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:23,965
Speaker 5:  I guess my ears are garbage.

1091
01:00:24,225 --> 01:00:26,005
Speaker 3:  You don't love your personalized spatial

1092
01:00:26,005 --> 01:00:28,445
Speaker 2:  Audio. No, your ears are good. That's

1093
01:00:28,445 --> 01:00:28,765
Speaker 3:  The problem.

1094
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:29,925
Speaker 5:  There we go.

1095
01:00:30,095 --> 01:00:33,365
Speaker 2:  Right. So If, you are not If you don't have some big as you get older right.

1096
01:00:33,365 --> 01:00:36,165
Speaker 2:  You lose your high frequencies. It's like, have you ever watched these like

1097
01:00:36,165 --> 01:00:38,525
Speaker 2:  TikTok videos? It's like we can guess how old you are. Oh

1098
01:00:38,525 --> 01:00:40,005
Speaker 5:  No. There's a whole thing right now about it's just

1099
01:00:40,445 --> 01:00:40,525
Speaker 2:  Remarkable.

1100
01:00:40,555 --> 01:00:43,405
Speaker 5:  It's, and this, this wine that people hear

1101
01:00:44,685 --> 01:00:45,205
Speaker 5:  apparently the new

1102
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:45,845
Speaker 2:  Oh interesting.

1103
01:00:45,845 --> 01:00:46,845
Speaker 5:  Because I've been spending a

1104
01:00:46,845 --> 01:00:48,405
Speaker 2:  Lot of time going, it got a super high pitched wine on the

1105
01:00:48,405 --> 01:00:51,205
Speaker 5:  Tablets. Yeah. I'm like, oh my god, am I just so old? I didn't hear this

1106
01:00:51,435 --> 01:00:53,765
Speaker 5:  wine on the remarkable, right.

1107
01:00:53,765 --> 01:00:56,605
Speaker 2:  So you're losing, you might be losing the very, very top end, but as you

1108
01:00:56,605 --> 01:00:59,845
Speaker 2:  get older you lose even more or you have different cutouts or what all this

1109
01:00:59,845 --> 01:01:02,925
Speaker 2:  stuff happens. So If, you have reasonably good ears. The

1110
01:01:03,775 --> 01:01:07,405
Speaker 2:  let's tune it to make it work for you is gonna accomplish nothing. 'cause

1111
01:01:07,405 --> 01:01:11,245
Speaker 2:  there's nothing to tune. Okay. If, you have frequency dropouts or other

1112
01:01:11,245 --> 01:01:15,205
Speaker 2:  kinds of hearing issues. The tuning will actually overcome it and it

1113
01:01:15,205 --> 01:01:19,045
Speaker 2:  will sound clear and rich again. So, oh, will any of this work? I have

1114
01:01:19,045 --> 01:01:22,925
Speaker 2:  no idea. Yeah. On AirPods, this is what audiologists do today to tune

1115
01:01:22,925 --> 01:01:23,565
Speaker 2:  real hearing aids.

1116
01:01:23,785 --> 01:01:26,445
Speaker 5:  You just made my ears sound better, so this is great. Yeah.

1117
01:01:26,445 --> 01:01:28,805
Speaker 2:  You should be proud of, I mean you can't hear the remarkable, you're getting

1118
01:01:28,805 --> 01:01:29,845
Speaker 2:  old Alex, you, you should watch.

1119
01:01:29,845 --> 01:01:33,725
Speaker 5:  I know I'm getting old. I can't hear the remarkable, but the, the accessibility

1120
01:01:33,725 --> 01:01:35,765
Speaker 5:  feature on AirPods sucks for me. So that means

1121
01:01:35,765 --> 01:01:38,445
Speaker 3:  My hair great. I can convince most of those things are just scams perpetrated

1122
01:01:38,465 --> 01:01:42,445
Speaker 3:  by young people to make old people feel old. They're not playing sound when

1123
01:01:42,445 --> 01:01:44,285
Speaker 3:  they're like, only young people can hear this. This is what I

1124
01:01:44,285 --> 01:01:45,965
Speaker 2:  Told about. That's totally how you know you're getting old. That's that's

1125
01:01:45,965 --> 01:01:46,725
Speaker 2:  it. We're there.

1126
01:01:48,225 --> 01:01:50,845
Speaker 3:  But, but I think the, the thing you just mentioned, NELI, I think is actually

1127
01:01:50,845 --> 01:01:53,725
Speaker 3:  like the question of all of the AirPods kind of all the way down the line,

1128
01:01:53,985 --> 01:01:57,525
Speaker 3:  not including the max, which are technically a new product, but you know,

1129
01:01:57,725 --> 01:01:57,805
Speaker 3:  whatever

1130
01:01:59,635 --> 01:02:03,365
Speaker 3:  that can Apple back these really advanced features into the

1131
01:02:03,605 --> 01:02:06,205
Speaker 3:  existing product, I think is the question. Right. And even If, you go down

1132
01:02:06,205 --> 01:02:09,805
Speaker 3:  to the, the regular AirPods, it's a

1133
01:02:09,805 --> 01:02:13,565
Speaker 3:  $50 upgrade to get noise cancellation. And if

1134
01:02:13,565 --> 01:02:17,005
Speaker 3:  Apple has figured out how to do like genuinely good

1135
01:02:17,605 --> 01:02:20,805
Speaker 3:  a NC inside of an open ear set of headphones,

1136
01:02:21,505 --> 01:02:25,325
Speaker 3:  that's a big deal. $50 is a lot of money to spend for

1137
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:29,165
Speaker 3:  that particular upgrade. Especially if you're like, if you're not so

1138
01:02:29,415 --> 01:02:33,365
Speaker 3:  price sensitive that you only want the cheapest one, but you're too

1139
01:02:33,365 --> 01:02:36,925
Speaker 3:  price sensitive to buy the pros. Like there's a very odd sort of middle ground

1140
01:02:36,925 --> 01:02:40,045
Speaker 3:  there that I think Apple is trying to strike. And, and the question of can

1141
01:02:40,045 --> 01:02:43,925
Speaker 3:  we bring these advanced features down into a different form factor that is

1142
01:02:43,925 --> 01:02:47,885
Speaker 3:  not optimized and designed for those features kind of is the question. And

1143
01:02:47,885 --> 01:02:49,765
Speaker 3:  I have no idea. Have you tried these things at all yet?

1144
01:02:50,205 --> 01:02:54,125
Speaker 2:  I have not yet. Okay. I don't know if I believe it. Like we have to

1145
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:57,445
Speaker 2:  see it. Yeah. Like noise canceling is pretty dumb

1146
01:02:57,455 --> 01:03:01,005
Speaker 2:  technology. It's very clever and you need a lot of processing power to do

1147
01:03:01,005 --> 01:03:04,365
Speaker 2:  it. But the idea is pretty dumb, right? You listen to some things that you

1148
01:03:04,605 --> 01:03:08,165
Speaker 2:  identify as noise and then you just play back their

1149
01:03:08,165 --> 01:03:09,365
Speaker 2:  inverse to cancel out the

1150
01:03:09,365 --> 01:03:10,765
Speaker 3:  Sound. The opposite of that noise. Yeah.

1151
01:03:10,855 --> 01:03:14,805
Speaker 2:  Right. It's like it's very dumb idea. And the hard parts are

1152
01:03:14,805 --> 01:03:18,125
Speaker 2:  like identifying what is noise, making sure you don't, you know, accidentally

1153
01:03:18,125 --> 01:03:21,925
Speaker 2:  clip a bunch of useful frequencies, all this other stuff, doing an

1154
01:03:21,925 --> 01:03:25,885
Speaker 2:  open ear. You're just not in control of the sound environment. Like sound

1155
01:03:25,945 --> 01:03:29,805
Speaker 2:  is literally getting around the headphones. So are they just gonna run

1156
01:03:29,885 --> 01:03:33,805
Speaker 2:  a bunch of like white noise cancellation,

1157
01:03:34,085 --> 01:03:37,605
Speaker 2:  like super, like will other people be able to hear the cancellation is like

1158
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:38,365
Speaker 2:  kind of what I'm interested

1159
01:03:38,365 --> 01:03:39,885
Speaker 3:  In. Oh, that's interesting. Well,

1160
01:03:39,985 --> 01:03:43,485
Speaker 5:  I'm also curious. They they have to fit right? Like, like

1161
01:03:43,785 --> 01:03:46,925
Speaker 5:  the, the whole thing that they don't have a seal, they just sort of sit in

1162
01:03:46,925 --> 01:03:50,125
Speaker 5:  your ear. I I never liked them because they were that leaky. 'cause I could

1163
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:53,205
Speaker 5:  hear everything around me and now I'm gonna be able to hear everything around

1164
01:03:53,205 --> 01:03:57,085
Speaker 5:  me, but then sometimes it's gonna be blocking some stuff that feels like

1165
01:03:57,165 --> 01:04:01,125
Speaker 5:  a good recipe for like your brain just getting messed up trying to listen

1166
01:04:01,125 --> 01:04:02,445
Speaker 5:  to your headphones. Yeah.

1167
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:03,085
Speaker 2:  I mean, we'll see.

1168
01:04:03,085 --> 01:04:07,005
Speaker 5:  But it's Apple. I I wouldn't expect they wouldn't break brains with

1169
01:04:07,005 --> 01:04:07,285
Speaker 5:  product.

1170
01:04:07,795 --> 01:04:11,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I mean they're, they're gonna, they're confident It is what I'd say.

1171
01:04:11,035 --> 01:04:11,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

1172
01:04:11,635 --> 01:04:14,645
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And I think it, it is the sort of thing that

1173
01:04:16,195 --> 01:04:19,685
Speaker 3:  it's an odd skew of the product. Like If, you go to Apple's website right

1174
01:04:19,685 --> 01:04:23,445
Speaker 3:  now and you go to buy AirPods, the options are AirPods and AirPods with adaptive

1175
01:04:23,445 --> 01:04:26,485
Speaker 3:  noise cancellation. And I think If, you have a product that is technically

1176
01:04:26,505 --> 01:04:30,245
Speaker 3:  titled AirPods with adaptive Noise cancellation. You should maybe

1177
01:04:30,275 --> 01:04:34,005
Speaker 3:  rethink your product SKUs. But like, if, if

1178
01:04:34,005 --> 01:04:36,965
Speaker 3:  they've done that, I think suddenly like this becomes at

1179
01:04:37,005 --> 01:04:40,805
Speaker 3:  $179, like maybe the pair of headphones that just about

1180
01:04:40,805 --> 01:04:41,525
Speaker 3:  everybody should buy.

1181
01:04:41,785 --> 01:04:44,845
Speaker 5:  But I don't think that's gonna be the case because of the fit. Like, like

1182
01:04:44,865 --> 01:04:48,725
Speaker 5:  the fit on the AirPods is so specific and it works for a lot of

1183
01:04:48,725 --> 01:04:51,805
Speaker 5:  people. And if it doesn't work for you, it sucks.

1184
01:04:51,985 --> 01:04:53,765
Speaker 3:  That's true of the pros too though. Yeah. Can I

1185
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:57,445
Speaker 2:  Say two things about this? One Apple said without any sourcing that

1186
01:04:57,445 --> 01:05:00,445
Speaker 2:  AirPods two are the most popular he iPhone in the world, which I can believe

1187
01:05:00,565 --> 01:05:04,245
Speaker 2:  I would just Sure, sure. It's like The Verge is the most popular website

1188
01:05:04,245 --> 01:05:07,965
Speaker 2:  in the world. Like Sure. You can believe it. We are by the way. It's true.

1189
01:05:07,965 --> 01:05:11,445
Speaker 2:  That's true. And then second, they introduced the new AirPods four

1190
01:05:11,915 --> 01:05:15,645
Speaker 2:  with this sort of like, you know, short description how everyone's ears are

1191
01:05:15,645 --> 01:05:18,405
Speaker 2:  different. They've measured all the ears and they got to the right chin.

1192
01:05:18,405 --> 01:05:18,925
Speaker 2:  They said that

1193
01:05:18,925 --> 01:05:19,445
Speaker 5:  The first time

1194
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:22,965
Speaker 2:  They No, no, not even the first time they said that when they announced the

1195
01:05:23,095 --> 01:05:24,165
Speaker 2:  wired EarPods

1196
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:29,645
Speaker 2:  with not, I think not even the first iPhone, like with an iPod nano is when

1197
01:05:29,645 --> 01:05:30,445
Speaker 2:  EarPods came out, right?

1198
01:05:30,795 --> 01:05:34,605
Speaker 5:  Yeah, yeah. Because you would ask like, like I've asked them before, Hey,

1199
01:05:35,025 --> 01:05:38,565
Speaker 5:  are we ever gonna get different sizes because these are too big for some

1200
01:05:38,565 --> 01:05:42,285
Speaker 5:  ears? And they'd be like, no, we did a test and it works for

1201
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:45,645
Speaker 5:  90.9% or whatever, you're fine.

1202
01:05:46,225 --> 01:05:49,845
Speaker 3:  But the thing is like that's that's true. Like it turns out

1203
01:05:49,995 --> 01:05:53,525
Speaker 3:  that everyone started wearing EarPods and buying

1204
01:05:53,675 --> 01:05:56,885
Speaker 3:  iPhones because they worked for most people. Oh

1205
01:05:56,885 --> 01:05:59,925
Speaker 5:  No, I can't use the, the original AirPods. I couldn't fit in them at all.

1206
01:06:00,245 --> 01:06:00,365
Speaker 5:  I

1207
01:06:00,365 --> 01:06:01,645
Speaker 3:  Had to get rid of them. Well listen Alex, we've established,

1208
01:06:01,755 --> 01:06:03,125
Speaker 5:  I've got tiny ear canals. Okay.

1209
01:06:03,515 --> 01:06:04,565
Speaker 3:  It's, this

1210
01:06:04,565 --> 01:06:06,685
Speaker 5:  Is a very specific problem for

1211
01:06:06,685 --> 01:06:08,285
Speaker 3:  Me. Pros fit. You're good with pros, your pros

1212
01:06:08,285 --> 01:06:08,925
Speaker 5:  Fit. But I have to use this

1213
01:06:09,345 --> 01:06:10,965
Speaker 3:  The opposite. Pros feel awful on me.

1214
01:06:11,155 --> 01:06:14,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So Apple announced the EarPods in 2012.

1215
01:06:15,025 --> 01:06:19,005
Speaker 2:  It was a Johnny I video, it was alongside The iPhone five and the

1216
01:06:19,155 --> 01:06:22,965
Speaker 2:  iPod. It was like, what a year? This is how old they were. And at the

1217
01:06:22,965 --> 01:06:26,285
Speaker 2:  time they were like, we asked more than 600 people to test over a hundred

1218
01:06:26,285 --> 01:06:30,205
Speaker 2:  iterations of the EarPods. They, we made 'em run on treadmills

1219
01:06:30,205 --> 01:06:33,965
Speaker 2:  and extreme heat and cold. They did cardio. They shook their heads up and

1220
01:06:33,965 --> 01:06:37,845
Speaker 2:  down and ear pods are like the design that fit the most ears. And now

1221
01:06:37,845 --> 01:06:41,405
Speaker 2:  we're like 12 years later and they're like, we did it again. We've once again

1222
01:06:41,805 --> 01:06:44,805
Speaker 2:  measured all of the ears in the world and they look a little bit different.

1223
01:06:45,865 --> 01:06:46,565
Speaker 2:  And maybe that's true

1224
01:06:46,915 --> 01:06:48,245
Speaker 3:  Evolution baby. Sure.

1225
01:06:48,715 --> 01:06:51,445
Speaker 2:  It's, it's true. They, they stuck with this design for a long time and, and

1226
01:06:51,445 --> 01:06:55,205
Speaker 2:  maybe ears have changed, but I, I think the reason

1227
01:06:55,435 --> 01:06:59,325
Speaker 2:  AirPods Pro are the most more popular headphones

1228
01:06:59,325 --> 01:07:02,925
Speaker 2:  even are more expensive. Maybe just the word pro in the name. Maybe it's

1229
01:07:02,925 --> 01:07:05,725
Speaker 2:  noise canceling. I actually just think they stay in people's ears better.

1230
01:07:06,035 --> 01:07:06,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

1231
01:07:06,645 --> 01:07:07,245
Speaker 5:  I I would agree.

1232
01:07:07,685 --> 01:07:11,205
Speaker 3:  I do. I I I do agree with that. And I think especially early on, the regular

1233
01:07:11,475 --> 01:07:15,165
Speaker 3:  AirPods developed a reputation for falling out of your head. Right? Like

1234
01:07:15,165 --> 01:07:18,445
Speaker 3:  there, for years there were all those stories of people like losing the AirPod

1235
01:07:18,445 --> 01:07:21,325
Speaker 3:  on the street and it would fall down. And the, whether it was true for you

1236
01:07:21,345 --> 01:07:25,285
Speaker 3:  or not, that fear was real. And even, even for somebody like me,

1237
01:07:25,285 --> 01:07:28,645
Speaker 3:  it, they fit well in my ears. They don't fall out. I am perpetually terrified

1238
01:07:28,645 --> 01:07:31,805
Speaker 3:  they're gonna fall out because they feel loose. Which is actually like the

1239
01:07:31,805 --> 01:07:34,445
Speaker 3:  point, right? Yeah. You see people like, that's why I like them because they

1240
01:07:34,445 --> 01:07:38,365
Speaker 3:  don't feel like they're smooshed into my head, but it makes me

1241
01:07:38,365 --> 01:07:41,285
Speaker 3:  feel like they're gonna fall out all the time. And the pros for better and

1242
01:07:41,285 --> 01:07:45,165
Speaker 3:  worse smoosh into your head Yes. And don't feel that way. And I think,

1243
01:07:45,405 --> 01:07:48,125
Speaker 3:  I think that is real for people. Like, IIII agree with you. You

1244
01:07:48,125 --> 01:07:51,045
Speaker 5:  See people like covering their ears sometimes if they're walking over a great

1245
01:07:51,505 --> 01:07:55,365
Speaker 5:  or, or hopp on the train and, and because I think like the, the

1246
01:07:55,565 --> 01:07:58,485
Speaker 5:  og AirPods feel kind of like earrings,

1247
01:07:59,425 --> 01:08:02,685
Speaker 5:  but then like clip on earrings. This is something you neither one of you

1248
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:05,725
Speaker 5:  probably have a lot of familiarity with. But there, you know, there's earrings

1249
01:08:05,725 --> 01:08:08,605
Speaker 5:  that go in your ear and judgment that cramp. They hang right there. That's

1250
01:08:08,605 --> 01:08:12,525
Speaker 5:  true. What's, what's that little, little piercing there? David looks great,

1251
01:08:13,465 --> 01:08:16,285
Speaker 5:  but people, you know, they like in and the, when you have those clip-ons,

1252
01:08:16,285 --> 01:08:19,445
Speaker 5:  you're constantly like holding your hands up because they're gonna fall off.

1253
01:08:19,475 --> 01:08:22,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah. and AirPods feel the same way. And nobody wants, nobody wants clip-ons.

1254
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:26,885
Speaker 2:  I just like how much you two are looking at people in their AirPods, like

1255
01:08:26,885 --> 01:08:29,885
Speaker 2:  is anthropologists. Yeah. Like David's like there's another couple wearing

1256
01:08:29,885 --> 01:08:33,565
Speaker 2:  one AirPod each. And Alex is like, another person's here buffing over a grate.

1257
01:08:33,625 --> 01:08:33,845
Speaker 2:  And

1258
01:08:34,315 --> 01:08:36,045
Speaker 5:  It's nice because then I'm like, oh, I'm not

1259
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:36,645
Speaker 2:  Alone. I'm

1260
01:08:36,725 --> 01:08:37,845
Speaker 3:  Fascinated. It's called journalism.

1261
01:08:38,275 --> 01:08:38,885
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that too.

1262
01:08:39,275 --> 01:08:42,765
Speaker 3:  This is also why I read everyone's screens when they're texting on the train.

1263
01:08:43,075 --> 01:08:43,845
Speaker 3:  It's journalism.

1264
01:08:44,565 --> 01:08:47,365
Speaker 5:  I love it when you find somebody like typing spicy stuff. You're like, oh

1265
01:08:47,365 --> 01:08:48,245
Speaker 5:  my god. Little

1266
01:08:48,965 --> 01:08:52,725
Speaker 3:  I literal, I had one time, this is a true story, missed my train and

1267
01:08:52,725 --> 01:08:56,605
Speaker 3:  rode it for one extra hour because there was a guy I was

1268
01:08:56,805 --> 01:08:59,845
Speaker 3:  standing and he was sitting in like the first seat next to me and he was

1269
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:02,685
Speaker 3:  in the middle of breaking up with his girlfriend over text messages. And

1270
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:02,925
Speaker 3:  you

1271
01:09:02,925 --> 01:09:03,445
Speaker 2:  Read the whole thing.

1272
01:09:03,445 --> 01:09:07,325
Speaker 3:  And I, for one more hour than I needed to just, I,

1273
01:09:07,405 --> 01:09:11,045
Speaker 3:  I got through the whole breakup. It was spectacular. It, it involved

1274
01:09:12,295 --> 01:09:16,085
Speaker 3:  7,000 words of text messages. Wow. If you made me guess. It was, it was

1275
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:16,365
Speaker 3:  incredible.

1276
01:09:16,555 --> 01:09:18,925
Speaker 2:  Were you like Jennifer for one second? You just call her on the phone.

1277
01:09:18,995 --> 01:09:21,725
Speaker 3:  Seriously. Right. It's like I'll FaceTime her right now. Like we can do this

1278
01:09:21,885 --> 01:09:23,085
Speaker 3:  together. What, what's up? It'll be fine.

1279
01:09:23,665 --> 01:09:23,885
Speaker 2:  You

1280
01:09:23,885 --> 01:09:24,405
Speaker 5:  Just sit down next to him.

1281
01:09:25,005 --> 01:09:28,445
Speaker 2:  I hear her on the market. The guy next to me on the plane here, I swear to

1282
01:09:28,445 --> 01:09:32,365
Speaker 2:  God was trying to rot August flight. He failed six hour flight from New York

1283
01:09:32,365 --> 01:09:35,805
Speaker 2:  to California. That's tough. Failed. Failed. Just like failed. Then he picked

1284
01:09:35,805 --> 01:09:39,285
Speaker 2:  up his phone, started typing in all lower case in notes app for a while.

1285
01:09:39,345 --> 01:09:42,685
Speaker 2:  Didn't read it. I did see him text the words I need to write my own narrative

1286
01:09:42,685 --> 01:09:45,845
Speaker 2:  to a friend also in lower case. And then

1287
01:09:46,525 --> 01:09:50,325
Speaker 2:  weirdest of all on his phone, on on Delta wifi,

1288
01:09:50,375 --> 01:09:54,365
Speaker 2:  which is garbage. Started powering through Gmail on

1289
01:09:54,365 --> 01:09:58,125
Speaker 2:  the web in Safari with the banner at the top of the screen

1290
01:09:58,125 --> 01:10:01,245
Speaker 2:  that said Gmail's better in the app. And I kept wanting to be like, bro,

1291
01:10:01,305 --> 01:10:02,325
Speaker 2:  it is better in the app.

1292
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:03,725
Speaker 5:  I love him.

1293
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:07,885
Speaker 3:  I honestly believe in moments like that is it is a, it should be allowed

1294
01:10:07,905 --> 01:10:10,605
Speaker 3:  to just reach over and tap the open button that opens it into the app.

1295
01:10:10,965 --> 01:10:14,365
Speaker 2:  I really believe that. You just, I was like, how are you using Safari with

1296
01:10:14,365 --> 01:10:17,885
Speaker 2:  the, the, the, the address bar on the bottom and you've got,

1297
01:10:18,545 --> 01:10:19,445
Speaker 2:  all right, that's fine.

1298
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:20,725
Speaker 3:  That hurts me to hit that. He

1299
01:10:20,725 --> 01:10:24,165
Speaker 5:  Needs that, that 6.7 inch iPhone or

1300
01:10:24,185 --> 01:10:25,725
Speaker 5:  6.9 inch iPhone. He needs

1301
01:10:25,725 --> 01:10:26,845
Speaker 2:  A big one. So You can use You, can use Gmail.

1302
01:10:27,135 --> 01:10:31,125
Speaker 3:  Apple can One more line of text. Yeah. Speaking of one more line of text,

1303
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:31,845
Speaker 3:  let's talk about the watches.

1304
01:10:32,195 --> 01:10:33,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah, they're big.

1305
01:10:34,475 --> 01:10:36,565
Speaker 3:  They are big. That's

1306
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:39,605
Speaker 2:  Basically another, another a moment in this keynote where Apple took a minute

1307
01:10:39,605 --> 01:10:42,725
Speaker 2:  to explain what You can do with the bigger screen the sees.

1308
01:10:44,645 --> 01:10:48,405
Speaker 2:  I would like if anyone's out there If, you could make me a super cut of Apple

1309
01:10:48,455 --> 01:10:51,565
Speaker 2:  executives patiently explaining that You can see more content on a bigger

1310
01:10:51,565 --> 01:10:54,445
Speaker 2:  screen over the past five years. It, I think it would be amazing.

1311
01:10:55,185 --> 01:10:56,405
Speaker 3:  It would also be hours long.

1312
01:10:58,305 --> 01:11:02,285
Speaker 3:  So, okay. The, the, the basic rundown on the watches as I understand

1313
01:11:02,285 --> 01:11:06,205
Speaker 3:  it is Apple, Watch, Series 10 new design. That looks

1314
01:11:06,205 --> 01:11:09,165
Speaker 3:  an awful lot like the old design. It's thinner, it has a bigger screen.

1315
01:11:10,545 --> 01:11:13,965
Speaker 3:  It comes in black I would say those are the salient points. It also comes

1316
01:11:13,965 --> 01:11:16,725
Speaker 3:  in other colors. Nobody seems to care about those colors. It comes in black.

1317
01:11:16,725 --> 01:11:18,725
Speaker 3:  Everybody's pretty excited about that fact. Shiny,

1318
01:11:18,815 --> 01:11:19,485
Speaker 2:  Shiny black.

1319
01:11:20,075 --> 01:11:23,085
Speaker 3:  Okay. How shiny are we talking? Well, okay, hold on. We'll get to, I wanna

1320
01:11:23,085 --> 01:11:25,885
Speaker 3:  talk, I want to hear what you think Neli. But then there's also the watch

1321
01:11:25,905 --> 01:11:29,805
Speaker 3:  two, which is nothing at all has changed except now it also comes in

1322
01:11:29,805 --> 01:11:31,365
Speaker 3:  black. Which again the

1323
01:11:31,445 --> 01:11:32,725
Speaker 2:  Ultra, a lot of two.

1324
01:11:32,995 --> 01:11:33,605
Speaker 3:  What did I say?

1325
01:11:33,745 --> 01:11:37,285
Speaker 2:  You said watch two son of it. The watch two is, it's

1326
01:11:37,565 --> 01:11:39,805
Speaker 2:  dramatic changes since the Apple Watch Series. It's changed

1327
01:11:39,805 --> 01:11:42,285
Speaker 3:  A lot since the Watch two If, you have a watch two you're in for

1328
01:11:42,285 --> 01:11:45,885
Speaker 2:  A treat. But the Apple watch Ultra two is unchanged. They did, they basically

1329
01:11:46,205 --> 01:11:49,765
Speaker 2:  reintroduce the product. They're like the ultra two is great for swimming

1330
01:11:49,945 --> 01:11:53,845
Speaker 2:  and rowing and, and diving and also just looking chunky and like you have

1331
01:11:53,845 --> 01:11:56,605
Speaker 2:  money also. It's black now then that was the end of that.

1332
01:11:56,985 --> 01:11:57,205
Speaker 5:  Yep.

1333
01:11:58,585 --> 01:12:02,325
Speaker 2:  But the, the series 10 is a new design. It looks for

1334
01:12:02,385 --> 01:12:05,565
Speaker 2:  all the world, like the old, old design. It's just thinner. It's more rounded

1335
01:12:05,565 --> 01:12:09,405
Speaker 2:  on the top and yeah, it comes in polished aluminum black

1336
01:12:11,155 --> 01:12:14,245
Speaker 3:  Charges faster, which I think is very exciting. Yeah. But the, the design

1337
01:12:14,245 --> 01:12:17,845
Speaker 3:  is the one I'm curious about. 'cause I, my immediate reaction when they said

1338
01:12:18,115 --> 01:12:22,005
Speaker 3:  thinner was I, I don't care. Right? Like I, I looked at

1339
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:23,805
Speaker 3:  the watch that was on my wrist and I was like, I don't, I don't know that

1340
01:12:23,805 --> 01:12:26,485
Speaker 3:  I've ever wished for this thing to be thinner. It's how I feel about my iPhone.

1341
01:12:26,485 --> 01:12:28,725
Speaker 3:  Right? Like every time they make it thinner, I'm like, that's nothing for

1342
01:12:28,725 --> 01:12:32,325
Speaker 3:  me. But then there were a bunch of people I saw on, on

1343
01:12:32,325 --> 01:12:36,125
Speaker 3:  Threads and elsewhere who were like, oh, you know, just based on like the,

1344
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:39,325
Speaker 3:  the clothes I wear or like how I use my wrist, having something that's thinner

1345
01:12:39,325 --> 01:12:42,205
Speaker 3:  is actually really meaningful. So what I'm curious about neli, especially

1346
01:12:42,205 --> 01:12:46,045
Speaker 3:  as somebody who wears the chunky one every day, did

1347
01:12:46,205 --> 01:12:49,365
Speaker 3:  it feel different like If you had just picked it up. Would you have been

1348
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,965
Speaker 3:  able to tell, 'cause it's been years really since you've been able to tell

1349
01:12:51,965 --> 01:12:53,605
Speaker 3:  kind of which one you were picking up? Yeah.

1350
01:12:54,025 --> 01:12:57,765
Speaker 2:  If you were paying attention. Yeah. Okay. For a normal person

1351
01:12:57,895 --> 01:13:00,045
Speaker 2:  you'd be like, the screen's bigger and that would be the thing.

1352
01:13:00,435 --> 01:13:01,005
Speaker 3:  Okay. Right.

1353
01:13:01,005 --> 01:13:04,645
Speaker 2:  You know how You can tell between a two and a four? 'cause the screen

1354
01:13:04,785 --> 01:13:07,005
Speaker 2:  got bigger. Was the four or five of the screen got bigger? I think it was

1355
01:13:07,005 --> 01:13:09,965
Speaker 2:  the four, right? I think that's right. So you know, the screen got bigger

1356
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:12,885
Speaker 2:  so You can tell. And then the four to everything else, you couldn't tell.

1357
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:16,765
Speaker 2:  It's that again. So it's like a very minor

1358
01:13:16,765 --> 01:13:19,685
Speaker 2:  adjustment, but it's bigger, thinner I think is hard.

1359
01:13:21,425 --> 01:13:25,365
Speaker 2:  but it, you know, for all intents and purposes, it's the same design.

1360
01:13:25,875 --> 01:13:28,445
Speaker 2:  Like we can lie to ourselves and say it's not the same design. It's the same

1361
01:13:28,445 --> 01:13:28,685
Speaker 2:  design.

1362
01:13:29,265 --> 01:13:32,445
Speaker 3:  Is the 10 screen now bigger than the ultra screen?

1363
01:13:32,865 --> 01:13:34,045
Speaker 2:  Yes. That's the thing they said

1364
01:13:34,715 --> 01:13:35,005
Speaker 3:  Wild,

1365
01:13:36,475 --> 01:13:39,845
Speaker 5:  Wild. Just the both screens or the 40. 'cause it's a

1366
01:13:39,845 --> 01:13:40,765
Speaker 5:  49.

1367
01:13:41,345 --> 01:13:45,205
Speaker 3:  No, the the case is the same size, but I guess because they made the

1368
01:13:45,205 --> 01:13:46,605
Speaker 3:  screen bigger in the case.

1369
01:13:46,915 --> 01:13:50,725
Speaker 5:  Okay. So the, it's now so bigger. There's a 42 and 46

1370
01:13:51,345 --> 01:13:55,245
Speaker 5:  are the case sizes. And the screen on both of them is bigger

1371
01:13:55,245 --> 01:13:55,925
Speaker 5:  than the ultra?

1372
01:13:56,585 --> 01:13:58,525
Speaker 3:  No, it has to just be the 46 to the

1373
01:13:58,525 --> 01:13:59,005
Speaker 5:  Bigger one. It has to be,

1374
01:13:59,005 --> 01:13:59,765
Speaker 3:  Yeah, it's a bigger

1375
01:13:59,765 --> 01:14:00,445
Speaker 5:  One. Okay.

1376
01:14:01,115 --> 01:14:05,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I mean it looks very nice. It looks very cool. You know, the, the

1377
01:14:05,045 --> 01:14:07,965
Speaker 2:  highlight features actually sleep apnea detection, not the size.

1378
01:14:09,105 --> 01:14:12,645
Speaker 2:  We have to see how well sleep apnea detection works works another FDA clearance

1379
01:14:13,085 --> 01:14:14,645
Speaker 2:  situation for Apple. Did

1380
01:14:14,645 --> 01:14:17,205
Speaker 3:  Either of you have a moment during the keynote where you were like, oh God,

1381
01:14:17,205 --> 01:14:19,925
Speaker 3:  am I about to find out I have sleep apnea. Like I don't know if this is a

1382
01:14:19,925 --> 01:14:20,885
Speaker 3:  thing I wanna know about myself.

1383
01:14:21,225 --> 01:14:24,965
Speaker 5:  I'm ready. I'm ready to learn. I'm open to new experiences.

1384
01:14:25,285 --> 01:14:25,565
Speaker 5:  I don't

1385
01:14:25,565 --> 01:14:28,045
Speaker 2:  Like wearing a watch when I sleep. I like

1386
01:14:28,045 --> 01:14:28,845
Speaker 3:  You don't sleep with your watch.

1387
01:14:29,345 --> 01:14:31,965
Speaker 2:  No, I, I I just, no, thank you.

1388
01:14:32,525 --> 01:14:36,365
Speaker 3:  I would say truly sincerely, my single favorite thing

1389
01:14:36,455 --> 01:14:40,285
Speaker 3:  about the Apple Watch is how good an alarm clock it is for my body. Like

1390
01:14:40,285 --> 01:14:43,925
Speaker 3:  it wakes me up better and easier and more pleasantly

1391
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:47,445
Speaker 3:  than any alarm clock I've ever tried. And that is like two thirds of the

1392
01:14:47,445 --> 01:14:47,765
Speaker 3:  reason I wear

1393
01:14:47,925 --> 01:14:49,005
Speaker 2:  It. But when do you charge it?

1394
01:14:50,405 --> 01:14:53,765
Speaker 3:  I So I actually this is the reason. Faster charging is very exciting to me.

1395
01:14:53,885 --> 01:14:57,045
Speaker 3:  I charge it. Typically I will take it off when I go to shower in the morning

1396
01:14:57,305 --> 01:15:00,525
Speaker 3:  and I will just leave it on the charger till it's full. Mm. And sometimes

1397
01:15:00,555 --> 01:15:03,205
Speaker 3:  that means I leave it there for five days because I just forget about it.

1398
01:15:03,785 --> 01:15:07,645
Speaker 3:  But so the idea of actually being able to like put it down, go shower, come

1399
01:15:07,645 --> 01:15:11,405
Speaker 3:  back and it has charged, well I think it was 80% in 30 minutes it was supposed

1400
01:15:11,405 --> 01:15:15,205
Speaker 3:  to be. Yep. If it, if, if it gets to that suddenly in

1401
01:15:15,385 --> 01:15:19,205
Speaker 3:  my own experience Apple watch battery life sort of ceases to be a thing.

1402
01:15:19,665 --> 01:15:21,845
Speaker 3:  And I find that very exciting. Yeah.

1403
01:15:22,345 --> 01:15:22,565
Speaker 2:  But

1404
01:15:22,585 --> 01:15:26,485
Speaker 5:  And it's the battery life's gotten really good over the last few years anyway.

1405
01:15:26,785 --> 01:15:30,725
Speaker 3:  The ultra is pretty good and I think the ultra, the a little I is still rated

1406
01:15:30,755 --> 01:15:34,685
Speaker 3:  like double what the series 10 is. I worry a little about the series 10 bigger

1407
01:15:34,685 --> 01:15:37,005
Speaker 3:  screen brighter screen

1408
01:15:37,395 --> 01:15:37,885
Speaker 5:  Thinner.

1409
01:15:38,155 --> 01:15:41,965
Speaker 3:  Thinner does not typically bode well for good battery. Yeah.

1410
01:15:42,185 --> 01:15:45,645
Speaker 2:  Oh one, can I just say one thing? Random comment on screens. The

1411
01:15:45,995 --> 01:15:49,805
Speaker 2:  screens on The iPhone 1616 Pro can now go

1412
01:15:49,805 --> 01:15:53,605
Speaker 2:  down to one knit of brightness. Yes. It's actually wild to look at.

1413
01:15:53,625 --> 01:15:57,285
Speaker 2:  You turn the brightness all the way down. It's like the, it's just like a

1414
01:15:57,285 --> 01:15:58,525
Speaker 2:  ghost of an image. It's pretty cool.

1415
01:15:58,825 --> 01:16:02,285
Speaker 3:  That's actually awesome. Like somebody who uses my phone in bed more than

1416
01:16:02,305 --> 01:16:05,845
Speaker 3:  I'm proud of being able to get it like properly dim

1417
01:16:06,415 --> 01:16:08,565
Speaker 5:  Happy, get a one knit bed. Yeah.

1418
01:16:08,965 --> 01:16:12,565
Speaker 3:  That's, that's the dream. Like we were talking last week about like e ink

1419
01:16:12,565 --> 01:16:15,805
Speaker 3:  devices and like what If you could make your screen not look so blue and

1420
01:16:15,805 --> 01:16:19,565
Speaker 3:  bright like one knit of brightness will do it. That'll get you

1421
01:16:19,565 --> 01:16:19,805
Speaker 3:  there.

1422
01:16:21,475 --> 01:16:25,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah, no, it was very, it was very impressive. And then 2000 hits in in sunlight,

1423
01:16:25,285 --> 01:16:27,005
Speaker 2:  which is ridiculous. But yeah,

1424
01:16:27,365 --> 01:16:27,965
Speaker 3:  I really like she

1425
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:29,365
Speaker 5:  Accidentally flash it on in bed.

1426
01:16:29,555 --> 01:16:32,245
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Who was it? Was it Craig or somebody else who was like, sometimes people

1427
01:16:32,245 --> 01:16:35,165
Speaker 3:  look at their watches at an angle and it was like, yeah. Thanks dude. People

1428
01:16:35,165 --> 01:16:36,525
Speaker 3:  look at their watches at an angle. Yeah, they

1429
01:16:36,695 --> 01:16:40,525
Speaker 2:  Crazy. They, the viewing angle of the watch, the series 10 ed

1430
01:16:40,545 --> 01:16:44,485
Speaker 2:  is picked. I mean like again, If, you watch this keynote, the number of

1431
01:16:45,135 --> 01:16:49,045
Speaker 2:  times where they explain things like basic facts

1432
01:16:49,045 --> 01:16:52,325
Speaker 2:  about screens is so no one has seen a screen before

1433
01:16:52,945 --> 01:16:54,445
Speaker 2:  is hilarious. Yeah.

1434
01:16:54,955 --> 01:16:57,885
Speaker 5:  Wide angle ed. Yeah. That's like a whole

1435
01:16:57,885 --> 01:17:01,685
Speaker 2:  Phrase being used also. And I, and I say this in all compliments

1436
01:17:02,265 --> 01:17:05,645
Speaker 2:  as though Apple doesn't already make the best screens consistently in the

1437
01:17:05,645 --> 01:17:09,005
Speaker 2:  street. They're like this piece of garbage series not in display.

1438
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:13,565
Speaker 2:  You couldn't even look at it from an angle. It's a terrify fine. Actually

1439
01:17:14,145 --> 01:17:16,205
Speaker 2:  no one was worried about that before. No,

1440
01:17:16,825 --> 01:17:19,805
Speaker 3:  Not, not a real thing. Wait, I wanna know about the blacks. Talk about the

1441
01:17:19,805 --> 01:17:23,765
Speaker 3:  blacks. You, you looked at both watches sincerely. It, it seems like

1442
01:17:24,545 --> 01:17:28,405
Speaker 3:  it. Apple had just gotten on stage and said we've changed

1443
01:17:28,405 --> 01:17:32,325
Speaker 3:  nothing except both watches now come in black. Everybody would've

1444
01:17:32,325 --> 01:17:35,085
Speaker 3:  been psyched and gone home happy. You've seen them both. How do they look

1445
01:17:35,085 --> 01:17:35,365
Speaker 3:  in black?

1446
01:17:35,505 --> 01:17:39,365
Speaker 2:  To be clear, they said we've changed nothing on one watch, which

1447
01:17:39,365 --> 01:17:40,205
Speaker 2:  now comes in black.

1448
01:17:40,405 --> 01:17:41,285
Speaker 3:  Okay. Fair. Do that. And I

1449
01:17:41,395 --> 01:17:42,845
Speaker 2:  Like, I'm gonna buy that watch. There's

1450
01:17:42,845 --> 01:17:45,885
Speaker 3:  A new watch face that does sort of a swirly thing where you can't really

1451
01:17:46,045 --> 01:17:47,765
Speaker 3:  tell what time it is. That's fun. Yeah, it's pretty cool.

1452
01:17:47,925 --> 01:17:51,205
Speaker 2:  I was talking to an Apple person wearing the black ultra too and I, I don't

1453
01:17:51,205 --> 01:17:53,125
Speaker 2:  even know what that person was saying. I was

1454
01:17:53,125 --> 01:17:54,325
Speaker 5:  Just like, just staring at the watch.

1455
01:17:54,605 --> 01:17:55,565
Speaker 2:  I was like, what if I just rob you?

1456
01:17:55,565 --> 01:17:56,925
Speaker 3:  But now that watch belongs to you. Yeah.

1457
01:17:56,925 --> 01:18:00,845
Speaker 2:  Like what if that was on my wrist and not yours? So that's great. I'm gonna

1458
01:18:00,845 --> 01:18:04,365
Speaker 2:  buy that one. The, the shiny aluminum. It is shiny

1459
01:18:04,845 --> 01:18:08,765
Speaker 2:  aluminum black. Like it's, it's, it's fine. Like I don't, I dunno

1460
01:18:08,765 --> 01:18:11,165
Speaker 2:  what to say about it. It's a, it's a, it's a black metallic, like

1461
01:18:11,305 --> 01:18:15,125
Speaker 3:  The shiny worries me because of scratches. Should I be worried about

1462
01:18:15,125 --> 01:18:15,685
Speaker 3:  scratches?

1463
01:18:16,825 --> 01:18:19,565
Speaker 2:  You know, that thing was so covered in fingerprints when I looked at it.

1464
01:18:19,605 --> 01:18:21,045
Speaker 2:  I couldn't tell you if it was scratched or not.

1465
01:18:21,345 --> 01:18:22,245
Speaker 3:  You know, also not great.

1466
01:18:23,875 --> 01:18:26,165
Speaker 2:  It's just, it's not what you want. Did you notice my pictures of the phone?

1467
01:18:26,315 --> 01:18:29,205
Speaker 2:  Also fingerprint city. But everyone puts the phone in cases, so who knows.

1468
01:18:29,275 --> 01:18:29,565
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

1469
01:18:30,065 --> 01:18:32,925
Speaker 3:  That's also been, yeah, it's been true for years. Every Apple product has

1470
01:18:32,925 --> 01:18:34,805
Speaker 5:  Fingerprint city. But don't have to put this put in cases.

1471
01:18:36,435 --> 01:18:37,245
Speaker 5:  Ceramic case,

1472
01:18:37,545 --> 01:18:40,565
Speaker 2:  The watch, you don't put a case by the way, the back of the Apple watch Ultra

1473
01:18:40,565 --> 01:18:44,365
Speaker 2:  two has special black sapphire glass. I'm gonna, I'm gonna buy this

1474
01:18:44,365 --> 01:18:45,765
Speaker 2:  product so fast for no

1475
01:21:05,945 --> 01:21:09,845
Speaker 3:  All right, we're back. So that was all the big stuff. There's lots of

1476
01:21:10,125 --> 01:21:13,005
Speaker 3:  software stuff to talk about, but I feel like that's actually probably better

1477
01:21:13,105 --> 01:21:15,645
Speaker 3:  for next week or when

1478
01:21:15,785 --> 01:21:16,165
Speaker 2:  It ships.

1479
01:21:16,515 --> 01:21:19,885
Speaker 3:  Well that's all, that's it's all shipping next week. All the, well, all the

1480
01:21:20,025 --> 01:21:23,325
Speaker 3:  new oss are shipping next week. All the Apple intelligence stuff is shipping

1481
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:25,325
Speaker 3:  someday in the unknown future.

1482
01:21:25,545 --> 01:21:29,245
Speaker 2:  If, you are a new Apple Os and you don't have Apple Intelligence.

1483
01:21:29,465 --> 01:21:30,885
Speaker 2:  Are you a new Apple OS yet?

1484
01:21:31,835 --> 01:21:35,685
Speaker 3:  Yeah, dude, have you seen how You can move the icons around on the grid now?

1485
01:21:37,155 --> 01:21:37,685
Speaker 3:  Game changer.

1486
01:21:38,245 --> 01:21:42,165
Speaker 2:  I actually, I'm I'm soliciting notes. We're gonna have to review these phones.

1487
01:21:43,245 --> 01:21:46,765
Speaker 2:  I don't know how without Apple Intelligence, I'm

1488
01:21:46,765 --> 01:21:50,325
Speaker 2:  legitimately like, how, how are we gonna write reviews of phones? So it'll

1489
01:21:50,325 --> 01:21:53,485
Speaker 2:  only exist in this form for some number of weeks

1490
01:21:54,225 --> 01:21:57,365
Speaker 2:  before the big update comes changes. It's so funny. I'm,

1491
01:21:57,745 --> 01:22:01,645
Speaker 3:  I'm, I'm less optimistic than that. I think, I

1492
01:22:01,645 --> 01:22:04,565
Speaker 3:  think there is a, a super solid chance

1493
01:22:05,595 --> 01:22:09,325
Speaker 3:  that the actual experience of Apple intelligence is not going to show up

1494
01:22:09,325 --> 01:22:12,245
Speaker 3:  in a real way until The iPhone 17.

1495
01:22:12,725 --> 01:22:13,685
Speaker 2:  I would agree. Sure.

1496
01:22:14,115 --> 01:22:18,085
Speaker 3:  Like I think these phones are The iPhone 15 plus

1497
01:22:18,145 --> 01:22:21,485
Speaker 3:  the camera control. And I think, I think everyone who has to review this

1498
01:22:21,485 --> 01:22:24,925
Speaker 3:  phone is going to have to spend a deeply hilarious amount of time

1499
01:22:24,925 --> 01:22:28,765
Speaker 3:  litigating a button in a way that I think is so fun and so virgin and

1500
01:22:28,765 --> 01:22:32,525
Speaker 3:  I'm very jealous to not get to do it. But like the

1501
01:22:32,705 --> 01:22:36,085
Speaker 3:  AI stuff is gonna come in these like tiny bits and pieces and if we weren't

1502
01:22:36,085 --> 01:22:39,925
Speaker 3:  in a crazy AI moment where everybody had to pretend

1503
01:22:39,945 --> 01:22:43,485
Speaker 3:  to have an AI strategy or Wall Street would run away from you, we would just

1504
01:22:43,485 --> 01:22:47,285
Speaker 3:  call these things software. They're just features of apps and

1505
01:22:47,805 --> 01:22:51,045
Speaker 3:  supposedly we're gonna get game changing Siri that makes everything better

1506
01:22:51,105 --> 01:22:54,765
Speaker 3:  and solves phone interfaces forever, someday in the future.

1507
01:22:55,245 --> 01:22:59,205
Speaker 3:  I am in no single way holding my breath for any of that to happen on

1508
01:22:59,205 --> 01:23:00,485
Speaker 3:  this cycle of this iPhone.

1509
01:23:01,195 --> 01:23:04,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I agree with you. I'm just saying I don't think iOS

1510
01:23:05,085 --> 01:23:09,005
Speaker 2:  18 plus camera button is like, there's not a lot there. You know what I mean?

1511
01:23:10,105 --> 01:23:13,645
Speaker 2:  As much as I love a camera button and I, most of iPhone reviews that I've

1512
01:23:13,645 --> 01:23:17,525
Speaker 2:  ever written have been long meditations on the camera. Happy to do it again

1513
01:23:18,145 --> 01:23:18,365
Speaker 5:  Now

1514
01:23:18,365 --> 01:23:22,205
Speaker 2:  With a button. Thrilled to do it again. I just, it feels

1515
01:23:22,395 --> 01:23:26,125
Speaker 2:  like the reason people will upgrade to this phone

1516
01:23:26,305 --> 01:23:30,205
Speaker 2:  is 'cause the AI capabilities will let them do stuff that

1517
01:23:30,205 --> 01:23:33,605
Speaker 2:  they couldn't do on their old phone. The old phones are very capable of taking

1518
01:23:33,685 --> 01:23:33,965
Speaker 2:  a photo.

1519
01:23:34,555 --> 01:23:38,245
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I mean, to be fair, a Apple has been making this particular case

1520
01:23:38,245 --> 01:23:41,885
Speaker 3:  since the iPad earlier this

1521
01:23:42,005 --> 01:23:45,605
Speaker 3:  spring. Like we're, we're deep into this now and, and Apple has been trying

1522
01:23:45,605 --> 01:23:49,485
Speaker 3:  to sell you AI ready devices without real AI to do it with

1523
01:23:50,265 --> 01:23:51,765
Speaker 3:  for months now. Yeah, well

1524
01:23:51,805 --> 01:23:55,485
Speaker 5:  I thought the AI stuff was largely for investors,

1525
01:23:56,155 --> 01:23:59,925
Speaker 5:  less for actual people. That was always kind of my read on Apple

1526
01:24:00,145 --> 01:24:00,365
Speaker 5:  ai.

1527
01:24:00,445 --> 01:24:03,885
Speaker 2:  I mean my, my number one question is why are they shipping these on September 20th

1528
01:24:03,885 --> 01:24:06,845
Speaker 2:  when the AI features are supposed to hit weeks later in October?

1529
01:24:07,535 --> 01:24:11,325
Speaker 3:  Again, some features in beta, like I,

1530
01:24:11,445 --> 01:24:11,725
Speaker 3:  I don't,

1531
01:24:12,035 --> 01:24:15,645
Speaker 2:  This is features aren't that long like fair

1532
01:24:15,865 --> 01:24:16,165
Speaker 3:  Or have

1533
01:24:16,165 --> 01:24:19,965
Speaker 2:  One to even have this series. The thing where you push the button and

1534
01:24:20,075 --> 01:24:23,285
Speaker 2:  Siri is now the border around the screen and set it a little circle.

1535
01:24:24,635 --> 01:24:25,445
Speaker 2:  Just gimme that.

1536
01:24:26,165 --> 01:24:29,085
Speaker 3:  I I honestly, it's so funny you say that. I was thinking about that this

1537
01:24:29,085 --> 01:24:32,445
Speaker 3:  afternoon. If they had just changed nothing else about Siri but made it glow

1538
01:24:32,445 --> 01:24:35,485
Speaker 3:  around the edges, everybody immediately would've been like, oh, Siri's better.

1539
01:24:36,185 --> 01:24:36,645
Speaker 3:  It just,

1540
01:24:36,825 --> 01:24:37,365
Speaker 2:  It would've,

1541
01:24:37,425 --> 01:24:41,245
Speaker 3:  It would've, it would've given everybody like a 10% boost in Siri

1542
01:24:41,245 --> 01:24:42,045
Speaker 3:  confidence. Anyway,

1543
01:24:42,265 --> 01:24:46,245
Speaker 2:  I'm open to to to feedback from y'all on how to review these

1544
01:24:46,245 --> 01:24:49,965
Speaker 2:  devices or when, 'cause I'm, I'm honestly

1545
01:24:49,965 --> 01:24:53,605
Speaker 2:  curious what would be the best service to everyone? Like a review of a phone

1546
01:24:54,315 --> 01:24:58,125
Speaker 2:  that If you buy in November has nothing to do with the phone that you bought

1547
01:24:58,505 --> 01:24:59,685
Speaker 2:  is kind of weird in my opinion.

1548
01:25:00,065 --> 01:25:03,605
Speaker 3:  Yep. Yeah. What you're actually getting at what I would say was the kind

1549
01:25:03,605 --> 01:25:06,845
Speaker 3:  of biggest vibe question that I had for you as somebody who's in the room

1550
01:25:06,845 --> 01:25:09,885
Speaker 3:  because Alex and I were not in the room and I would say the overwhelming

1551
01:25:09,975 --> 01:25:13,885
Speaker 3:  sense that I got from people both at The Verge and elsewhere. I was

1552
01:25:13,885 --> 01:25:17,005
Speaker 3:  getting text messages from people who were like, this is the most boring

1553
01:25:17,345 --> 01:25:21,285
Speaker 3:  iPhone launch I can remember. Same that like as, as a,

1554
01:25:21,305 --> 01:25:24,845
Speaker 3:  as a big flagship to September event. We talk about this every year, like

1555
01:25:24,845 --> 01:25:28,805
Speaker 3:  this is Apple's moment to speak to everyone. Like it is, it is the one that

1556
01:25:28,805 --> 01:25:32,445
Speaker 3:  everybody pays attention to. And I would say the overwhelming perception

1557
01:25:32,465 --> 01:25:36,285
Speaker 3:  was that it was kind of a bust. Yeah. How did it feel in the

1558
01:25:36,285 --> 01:25:37,725
Speaker 3:  room as it was happening?

1559
01:25:38,085 --> 01:25:41,365
Speaker 2:  I think this is why I kept notice noting the room was full of people who

1560
01:25:41,365 --> 01:25:45,045
Speaker 2:  were just excited to be there, right? Yeah. So they curated the

1561
01:25:45,045 --> 01:25:47,565
Speaker 2:  excitement that they needed and it was packed and people were freaking out

1562
01:25:47,565 --> 01:25:50,845
Speaker 2:  and they're doing the thing. And that's not to say I wasn't running around

1563
01:25:50,845 --> 01:25:54,405
Speaker 2:  trying to take photos and upload them as fast as I can. Like I like doing

1564
01:25:54,405 --> 01:25:58,365
Speaker 2:  it. It's like the funnest part of the job. But they had made the space

1565
01:25:58,395 --> 01:26:02,165
Speaker 2:  feel very excited and then you like take a step out of it and

1566
01:26:02,165 --> 01:26:05,685
Speaker 2:  you're like, okay, these are very iterative phones, like super

1567
01:26:05,685 --> 01:26:08,965
Speaker 2:  iterative phones. The headphones

1568
01:26:09,125 --> 01:26:13,085
Speaker 2:  upgrades apart from the 1.5 new models

1569
01:26:13,905 --> 01:26:17,805
Speaker 2:  are iterative to the point where like one of them didn't even

1570
01:26:17,805 --> 01:26:18,125
Speaker 2:  change

1571
01:26:20,225 --> 01:26:24,045
Speaker 2:  at all. The wash upgrades are also pretty iterative and

1572
01:26:24,395 --> 01:26:27,965
Speaker 2:  there's not any, I gotta have it upgrades unless you

1573
01:26:28,225 --> 01:26:31,925
Speaker 2:  really give a shit about the camera button. Right? All of those upgrades

1574
01:26:32,025 --> 01:26:35,885
Speaker 2:  are in the software That's Apple's magic, right. Hardware plus software services.

1575
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:40,285
Speaker 2:  and we're just waiting on the big stuff.

1576
01:26:40,475 --> 01:26:44,365
Speaker 2:  Like if Apple had said Siri can now do this

1577
01:26:44,365 --> 01:26:48,325
Speaker 2:  like app coordination assistant thing that everyone wants to get

1578
01:26:48,325 --> 01:26:51,925
Speaker 2:  to, I think everybody would've upgraded the phones tomorrow. Yep.

1579
01:26:52,215 --> 01:26:54,605
Speaker 3:  Right. There were a bunch of moments in the keynote like that actually. Like

1580
01:26:54,605 --> 01:26:58,085
Speaker 3:  the, there was a moment where in the visual intelligence demo,

1581
01:26:58,385 --> 01:27:02,285
Speaker 3:  the guy holds up a phone to a, it was like a concert poster or

1582
01:27:02,285 --> 01:27:05,765
Speaker 3:  something I think Some kind of event. Yeah. Yeah. and it was like it'll input

1583
01:27:06,025 --> 01:27:08,965
Speaker 3:  the information directly into your calendar when you take that picture. And

1584
01:27:08,965 --> 01:27:12,725
Speaker 3:  I was like, if that's, I will buy any phone that will do that for me tomorrow.

1585
01:27:12,795 --> 01:27:15,645
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It's just not Ready's awesome. and it just doesn't exist. There's

1586
01:27:15,645 --> 01:27:18,845
Speaker 2:  Also another extremely weird demo where, where somebody walked up to a dog

1587
01:27:18,945 --> 01:27:22,525
Speaker 2:  and like asked the phone what kind of dog it was. And our own Kylie

1588
01:27:22,845 --> 01:27:25,805
Speaker 2:  Robinson was like, why would you do that? Why would you walk up to a stranger's

1589
01:27:25,805 --> 01:27:26,285
Speaker 2:  dog to

1590
01:27:26,435 --> 01:27:28,885
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Just holding your phone out like this. Why,

1591
01:27:28,945 --> 01:27:30,805
Speaker 2:  Why wouldn't you just ask them what kind of dog this?

1592
01:27:31,475 --> 01:27:34,685
Speaker 3:  That gave me the same vibes as the the Gemini demo where

1593
01:27:35,285 --> 01:27:38,845
Speaker 3:  they were like, use this to write a, for your kid to write a letter to an

1594
01:27:38,845 --> 01:27:42,685
Speaker 3:  Olympian. It's like, oh, maybe you don't understand how people live and

1595
01:27:42,685 --> 01:27:46,525
Speaker 3:  exist in the world. Like this is actually like bleak as hell and not

1596
01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:48,365
Speaker 3:  cool and exciting technology. Yeah. The

1597
01:27:48,365 --> 01:27:51,725
Speaker 5:  Dog one. I did think, 'cause this's the same demo you do with the Met Raybans

1598
01:27:52,465 --> 01:27:55,085
Speaker 5:  is you put 'em on and you're like, what car is that? What dog is that?

1599
01:27:55,465 --> 01:27:59,085
Speaker 3:  But but the thing was he, he walked up to the person holding the dog

1600
01:27:59,305 --> 01:28:03,165
Speaker 3:  and the the intimation Is that what he said is not, oh that dog is so

1601
01:28:03,165 --> 01:28:05,845
Speaker 3:  cute. What dog is that? He said, can I take a picture of your dog with my

1602
01:28:05,845 --> 01:28:06,685
Speaker 3:  phone? Yeah.

1603
01:28:06,685 --> 01:28:08,965
Speaker 5:  Because I wanna know what kind of dog it's, and I don't wanna talk to you.

1604
01:28:09,905 --> 01:28:13,165
Speaker 2:  And I would point out you often encounter cars with they're owners,

1605
01:28:14,045 --> 01:28:16,645
Speaker 2:  If you encounter a dog without, so like that's, that's like a little bit

1606
01:28:16,645 --> 01:28:17,525
Speaker 2:  of an emergency.

1607
01:28:17,995 --> 01:28:18,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1608
01:28:19,465 --> 01:28:21,805
Speaker 2:  You're not like, what breed is this? I better find out.

1609
01:28:21,805 --> 01:28:23,205
Speaker 3:  Yeah, you're like, hold on, stop here dog.

1610
01:28:23,665 --> 01:28:25,005
Speaker 5:  You pause. I need to pose.

1611
01:28:26,965 --> 01:28:30,725
Speaker 2:  I I I just think, I think that is overwhelmingly the reason why at

1612
01:28:31,125 --> 01:28:34,845
Speaker 2:  distance, this one was the a little content free. Like even the

1613
01:28:34,845 --> 01:28:38,445
Speaker 2:  feature boxes, right? The bento boxes they put up at the end of every segment.

1614
01:28:38,865 --> 01:28:42,765
Speaker 2:  Go look at The iPhone 16 feature box. It says USBC

1615
01:28:42,785 --> 01:28:43,085
Speaker 2:  on it.

1616
01:28:44,795 --> 01:28:48,765
Speaker 2:  It's like, oh, we, we didn't even have enough to fill up the squares. And

1617
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:52,845
Speaker 2:  so like these are super iterative phones, which whose

1618
01:28:53,025 --> 01:28:56,725
Speaker 2:  key feature is the ram and the memory bandwidth to enable

1619
01:28:56,945 --> 01:29:00,525
Speaker 2:  all of the AI stuff which isn't shipping. Right? Yeah. So like why would

1620
01:29:00,525 --> 01:29:03,125
Speaker 2:  you be excited about it? And I think that's really the gap. I think they

1621
01:29:03,125 --> 01:29:06,445
Speaker 2:  should have said we're shipping these phones with the first wave of beta

1622
01:29:06,645 --> 01:29:10,445
Speaker 2:  features and just held them three weeks into October. But

1623
01:29:10,445 --> 01:29:13,165
Speaker 2:  Apple sells so many phones. So I don't think they can do that. Yeah.

1624
01:29:13,165 --> 01:29:15,765
Speaker 5:  Yeah. They couldn't afforded to hold it that long. They needed to get it

1625
01:29:15,765 --> 01:29:18,365
Speaker 5:  out and if the software is not ready, so be it.

1626
01:29:19,145 --> 01:29:21,765
Speaker 3:  And this goes back, Alex, to what you were saying is like the, the reason

1627
01:29:21,865 --> 01:29:25,765
Speaker 3:  you do that is Wall Street, right? Like yeah. This is not a thing you do

1628
01:29:25,765 --> 01:29:28,725
Speaker 3:  in the service of good user experience. This is a thing you do because we

1629
01:29:28,725 --> 01:29:32,485
Speaker 3:  are in a moment where If, you appear to be behind on ai, you will be punished.

1630
01:29:33,025 --> 01:29:37,005
Speaker 3:  And that is right or wrong. That is the world in which we live.

1631
01:29:37,025 --> 01:29:40,285
Speaker 3:  And so everyone is out here announcing features that aren't going to ship

1632
01:29:40,285 --> 01:29:44,165
Speaker 3:  anytime soon or ever because you have to and it's so

1633
01:29:44,385 --> 01:29:48,325
Speaker 3:  un apple-like to do that. Yeah. It's so, so, so

1634
01:29:48,505 --> 01:29:52,405
Speaker 3:  odd to see Apple tell you its plans. Like this is not what

1635
01:29:52,405 --> 01:29:55,725
Speaker 3:  Apple does. This is not what Apple has ever done. And and it has to because

1636
01:29:55,825 --> 01:29:57,685
Speaker 3:  it can't build the things yet. Did

1637
01:29:57,685 --> 01:30:01,445
Speaker 5:  You guys also notice that it was doing a weird thing where they didn't call

1638
01:30:01,445 --> 01:30:04,965
Speaker 5:  it ai, they called it like our Apple intelligence, but they wouldn't call

1639
01:30:04,965 --> 01:30:07,365
Speaker 5:  it ai. They would always default to machine learning.

1640
01:30:07,885 --> 01:30:11,645
Speaker 3:  I clocked once that he said the word ai, but every other one was some

1641
01:30:12,155 --> 01:30:14,525
Speaker 3:  like dance around it. Yeah.

1642
01:30:14,525 --> 01:30:17,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like they were really going outta their way to not sound like Google,

1643
01:30:18,105 --> 01:30:21,045
Speaker 5:  to not sound like their competitors in this space. Which is kind of interesting.

1644
01:30:21,485 --> 01:30:24,285
Speaker 2:  I mean they have branded Apple intelligence. I they're fine with it. Yeah.

1645
01:30:24,285 --> 01:30:24,485
Speaker 2:  Like

1646
01:30:24,635 --> 01:30:26,765
Speaker 5:  They, they do have their own ai Yeah.

1647
01:30:26,765 --> 01:30:30,485
Speaker 2:  They have multiple AI models. At one point, I believe with the watch If,

1648
01:30:30,485 --> 01:30:33,885
Speaker 2:  you go back and watch it. They point out that they're running many models

1649
01:30:33,945 --> 01:30:37,845
Speaker 2:  to enable the features you enjoy today. And it's like, great. So it's

1650
01:30:37,845 --> 01:30:39,965
Speaker 2:  the same the same as the one I have today.

1651
01:30:40,205 --> 01:30:43,765
Speaker 5:  Thanks. Yeah. That, that was just like, why are you talking to investors

1652
01:30:43,825 --> 01:30:47,005
Speaker 5:  during this infomercial? You're trying to sell me these phones. Yeah. To

1653
01:30:47,005 --> 01:30:50,965
Speaker 5:  the point where you even have buy now like verbiage

1654
01:30:50,985 --> 01:30:54,965
Speaker 5:  in your thing. Stop it. It was weird. But let's talk about fine

1655
01:30:55,085 --> 01:30:57,445
Speaker 5:  woven because it feels like fine woven might be gone.

1656
01:30:57,755 --> 01:31:01,285
Speaker 3:  Yeah. This is good. Before we leave, let's just little bit of accessory news

1657
01:31:01,385 --> 01:31:02,485
Speaker 3:  and then we're gonna get outta here. Is

1658
01:31:02,485 --> 01:31:03,605
Speaker 2:  This an accessory lightning round?

1659
01:31:03,955 --> 01:31:07,045
Speaker 3:  This is an accessory lightning round, but the way we're gonna do this is

1660
01:31:07,105 --> 01:31:09,885
Speaker 3:  I'm going to tell you what's happening and if you're not interested, just

1661
01:31:09,885 --> 01:31:12,045
Speaker 3:  don't say anything and we'll keep going. It's

1662
01:31:12,045 --> 01:31:13,605
Speaker 2:  Gonna be great. I love this. This is great.

1663
01:31:14,015 --> 01:31:17,725
Speaker 3:  Thing number one, apple has a faster mag safe charger to go with The

1664
01:31:17,825 --> 01:31:21,685
Speaker 3:  iPhone sixteens Q2, which I believe this might

1665
01:31:21,685 --> 01:31:25,085
Speaker 3:  be the first time a phone company has actually said Q2 out loud on stage

1666
01:31:25,085 --> 01:31:27,805
Speaker 3:  about a phone that people in America can buy. That's very exciting. Yep.

1667
01:31:29,505 --> 01:31:32,525
Speaker 5:  I'm excited. We're gonna, there we go. Charge faster. Yay. It's

1668
01:31:32,525 --> 01:31:36,165
Speaker 3:  Great. We love a fast charge. Love it. I said this in the lightning bug,

1669
01:31:36,165 --> 01:31:39,525
Speaker 3:  but there was a time that Neli made fun of me for having a MagSafe charger.

1670
01:31:40,045 --> 01:31:43,685
Speaker 3:  I I was, we were, we were in a, a restaurant somewhere and I slapped the

1671
01:31:43,685 --> 01:31:46,285
Speaker 3:  puck onto the back of my phone and Neli made fun of me for like 10 straight

1672
01:31:46,285 --> 01:31:47,245
Speaker 3:  minutes. I'm sorry.

1673
01:31:47,585 --> 01:31:49,965
Speaker 2:  If. you have a wire connected to a battery.

1674
01:31:51,545 --> 01:31:55,125
Speaker 2:  Why would you pick the least efficient way of charging your phone with that

1675
01:31:55,125 --> 01:31:55,365
Speaker 2:  wire?

1676
01:31:56,115 --> 01:31:59,565
Speaker 3:  Because it, it, it, it flocks. I love the block.

1677
01:32:00,115 --> 01:32:00,405
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

1678
01:32:01,635 --> 01:32:02,285
Speaker 5:  It's good noise.

1679
01:32:02,925 --> 01:32:05,925
Speaker 2:  I will say I'm a full convert into mag safe batteries.

1680
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:10,085
Speaker 2:  Actually I should have one over here. That, that's what I do now is like

1681
01:32:10,085 --> 01:32:12,685
Speaker 2:  the mag safe battery packs because you don't have to deal with the wires.

1682
01:32:12,795 --> 01:32:16,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah. They get hot and it's inefficient. And, if you have a wire connected

1683
01:32:16,325 --> 01:32:19,525
Speaker 2:  to a battery pack, David, you should just plug it into the bottom of the

1684
01:32:19,525 --> 01:32:19,685
Speaker 2:  phone.

1685
01:32:20,595 --> 01:32:20,885
Speaker 3:  Fuck.

1686
01:32:21,385 --> 01:32:21,805
Speaker 5:  Anyway,

1687
01:32:23,115 --> 01:32:26,525
Speaker 3:  Next up, like you were mentioning, Crans, So, I, I would actually like you

1688
01:32:26,525 --> 01:32:30,285
Speaker 3:  to explain this to me because we thought fine woven was probably dead.

1689
01:32:31,455 --> 01:32:35,445
Speaker 3:  Apple didn't say fine, woven is dead, but it kind of seems like fine

1690
01:32:35,565 --> 01:32:36,245
Speaker 3:  woven is

1691
01:32:36,245 --> 01:32:37,165
Speaker 5:  Dead fine. Just seems like Yeah,

1692
01:32:37,195 --> 01:32:41,165
Speaker 3:  Fine. Woven being apple's terrible bad take on

1693
01:32:41,165 --> 01:32:42,285
Speaker 3:  leather accessories.

1694
01:32:42,575 --> 01:32:46,285
Speaker 5:  Kinda this was their, their, their cloth accessory that was really just plastic

1695
01:32:46,355 --> 01:32:50,205
Speaker 5:  that was meant to like replace all the leather and be a lot more ego

1696
01:32:50,365 --> 01:32:53,885
Speaker 5:  friendly. And that's probably true. but it also sucked and it got

1697
01:32:54,085 --> 01:32:56,005
Speaker 5:  dirty and gross and nobody liked it.

1698
01:32:56,235 --> 01:32:59,765
Speaker 3:  Like what if it was leather? But like much worse. Yeah. Much, much worse.

1699
01:33:00,025 --> 01:33:01,285
Speaker 5:  And now you can't

1700
01:33:02,985 --> 01:33:06,165
Speaker 5:  buy a phone case made of fine woven.

1701
01:33:06,715 --> 01:33:09,485
Speaker 5:  There's a, there's a wallet and that, that's about it. We've, we've reached

1702
01:33:09,485 --> 01:33:11,925
Speaker 5:  out, we haven't heard anything back yet. The

1703
01:33:11,925 --> 01:33:14,445
Speaker 3:  Wallet strikes me as one where they're like, look, we have a bunch of these.

1704
01:33:14,465 --> 01:33:17,805
Speaker 3:  We might as well keep it for sale. Yeah. It's like Google with the Chromecast

1705
01:33:17,905 --> 01:33:21,485
Speaker 3:  now, where they were like, they have If. you take the TV streamer, they're

1706
01:33:21,485 --> 01:33:23,725
Speaker 3:  clearly out on the Chromecast, but they're like, look, there's a room full

1707
01:33:23,725 --> 01:33:27,685
Speaker 3:  of these. Like If, you wanna buy it? Yeah, please buy it. Fine. Woven has

1708
01:33:27,685 --> 01:33:30,085
Speaker 3:  been dead. I would say since about like a day after it launched.

1709
01:33:30,745 --> 01:33:34,645
Speaker 2:  The wallet doesn't require the size and shape of the phone. Right.

1710
01:33:34,705 --> 01:33:38,405
Speaker 2:  So like you can't just sell off the excess. Right. You have your iPhone 15

1711
01:33:38,465 --> 01:33:41,845
Speaker 2:  Pro Max cases and you don't make iPhone 15 Pro Maxes anymore. You're,

1712
01:33:42,505 --> 01:33:45,365
Speaker 2:  you're just like, I don't, can you recycle it? We recycle everything around

1713
01:33:45,365 --> 01:33:49,125
Speaker 2:  here. Just turn it into something else, Johnny. We'll see what happens.

1714
01:33:50,525 --> 01:33:51,685
Speaker 5:  Fine movement is not fine.

1715
01:33:52,155 --> 01:33:52,445
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

1716
01:33:52,445 --> 01:33:56,325
Speaker 3:  Yeah. All right. Next up. I would say one of the stranger stories of the

1717
01:33:56,325 --> 01:33:59,285
Speaker 3:  day, Beats famous

1718
01:34:00,295 --> 01:34:03,005
Speaker 3:  music company. You may have heard of them before. They make headphones, they

1719
01:34:03,005 --> 01:34:06,805
Speaker 3:  weights headphones. LeBron James wears them, made a bunch of iPhone 16 cases.

1720
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:08,165
Speaker 3:  Sure.

1721
01:34:08,895 --> 01:34:09,245
Speaker 2:  Beats,

1722
01:34:09,975 --> 01:34:12,165
Speaker 3:  Beats made iPhone 16 cases. It

1723
01:34:12,165 --> 01:34:15,565
Speaker 5:  Feels like a real, it feels like they've been trying to figure out where

1724
01:34:15,615 --> 01:34:19,605
Speaker 5:  Beats sits in their lineup, especially as AirPods get better. And their idea

1725
01:34:19,705 --> 01:34:23,325
Speaker 5:  is what if Beats is budget? You do cases now.

1726
01:34:24,105 --> 01:34:26,885
Speaker 3:  Oh, interesting. Do you, do you think that's where is going My interesting.

1727
01:34:27,435 --> 01:34:31,405
Speaker 5:  Yeah. 'cause 'cause you they, they, they, they are putting the good tech

1728
01:34:31,505 --> 01:34:34,765
Speaker 5:  in their headphones, but the headphones just also aren't

1729
01:34:35,255 --> 01:34:38,725
Speaker 5:  don't have that, that kind of ca cash that, that quality feeling. Right.

1730
01:34:40,685 --> 01:34:44,205
Speaker 3:  I just feel like my read on it was that Apple was just like, let Beats be

1731
01:34:44,205 --> 01:34:46,725
Speaker 3:  Beats. I just wanna say to everybody listening to this, by the way, NELI

1732
01:34:46,725 --> 01:34:49,645
Speaker 3:  is furiously Googling because he doesn't believe me that I got this right.

1733
01:34:50,005 --> 01:34:53,165
Speaker 3:  Which is how wild it is that Beats is making iPhone 16 cases.

1734
01:34:53,665 --> 01:34:55,165
Speaker 2:  I'm just like reading this news.

1735
01:34:55,755 --> 01:34:59,685
Speaker 3:  Neli Neli had to fact check me on The. Vergecast. Yeah. Because he didn't

1736
01:34:59,685 --> 01:35:03,365
Speaker 3:  believe me that Beats was making iPhone 16 cases. This is, this is all you

1737
01:35:03,365 --> 01:35:06,845
Speaker 3:  need to know about this story. They're $49. They exist.

1738
01:35:07,705 --> 01:35:08,125
Speaker 5:  That's

1739
01:35:08,125 --> 01:35:11,565
Speaker 3:  It. They are cases. They're cases. They look like the Apple cases, but they're

1740
01:35:11,565 --> 01:35:13,925
Speaker 3:  by Beats for some reason. They're so, don't

1741
01:35:14,025 --> 01:35:14,805
Speaker 2:  Get it. They're so weird.

1742
01:35:16,355 --> 01:35:17,205
Speaker 5:  It's so weird.

1743
01:35:18,315 --> 01:35:20,765
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It's very, it's very strange. I

1744
01:35:20,765 --> 01:35:22,565
Speaker 2:  Was instructed if I had nothing to say, to say nothing.

1745
01:35:23,245 --> 01:35:26,045
Speaker 3:  This is, no, this is great. I'm into it. Perfect. Moving on.

1746
01:35:27,095 --> 01:35:30,925
Speaker 3:  Bunch of new watch bands, bunch of new band colors. Can I interest you in

1747
01:35:30,925 --> 01:35:31,245
Speaker 3:  in that?

1748
01:35:32,065 --> 01:35:34,965
Speaker 5:  Get one on Etsy, it'll be a quarter of the price.

1749
01:35:35,585 --> 01:35:39,205
Speaker 2:  Or buy the Burg's own Nomad Blurple band, which is a big hit at Apple Park

1750
01:35:39,205 --> 01:35:39,485
Speaker 2:  today.

1751
01:35:39,715 --> 01:35:40,485
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Oh yeah.

1752
01:35:41,075 --> 01:35:43,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Love that. Many, many compliments.

1753
01:35:43,705 --> 01:35:44,325
Speaker 5:  It looks great.

1754
01:35:45,445 --> 01:35:48,925
Speaker 3:  I bought that one, which is very good. And I also bought six

1755
01:35:49,655 --> 01:35:53,045
Speaker 3:  Apple Watch bands on Amazon for like eight bucks.

1756
01:35:53,705 --> 01:35:55,725
Speaker 3:  Loving bits. Can't recommend it highly.

1757
01:35:55,895 --> 01:35:59,885
Speaker 2:  Those ones are slowly poisoning. David. And you should buy the Verges Blurple

1758
01:36:00,495 --> 01:36:01,125
Speaker 2:  sport band.

1759
01:36:01,445 --> 01:36:03,925
Speaker 3:  I do occasionally look at my wrist just to make sure it's not like turning

1760
01:36:04,005 --> 01:36:07,565
Speaker 3:  a color. I'm not psyched about Yeah, so far so good. But, but

1761
01:36:07,855 --> 01:36:11,325
Speaker 3:  we're, okay. The biggest question I have about accessories Neli is

1762
01:36:11,905 --> 01:36:15,605
Speaker 3:  how the camera control is gonna work with cases. This is a question a lot

1763
01:36:15,605 --> 01:36:19,285
Speaker 3:  of people are asking. It's this, it's this capacitive kind of flush

1764
01:36:19,395 --> 01:36:22,805
Speaker 3:  control, which seems like If you have any kind of raised case at all

1765
01:36:23,465 --> 01:36:27,365
Speaker 3:  is gonna be hard to find a way to get your finger inside of.

1766
01:36:27,705 --> 01:36:28,845
Speaker 3:  Do you have a sense of how this might work?

1767
01:36:29,315 --> 01:36:32,485
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I, although I think my worry is different than anyone else's worry

1768
01:36:32,715 --> 01:36:36,685
Speaker 2:  that can you make a capacitive button on a case connect to

1769
01:36:36,685 --> 01:36:40,045
Speaker 2:  a capacitive button on the phone. It's like pretty well and solved, right?

1770
01:36:40,045 --> 01:36:42,525
Speaker 2:  They just have to be conductive to each other. Sure. And so Apple's own cases

1771
01:36:42,555 --> 01:36:46,525
Speaker 2:  have a button that touches the other button and you're good. If there's

1772
01:36:46,665 --> 01:36:50,405
Speaker 2:  any play at all, if there's any space between the two

1773
01:36:50,405 --> 01:36:54,245
Speaker 2:  buttons, then that like push a little bit is gonna get weird

1774
01:36:55,485 --> 01:36:58,785
Speaker 2:  in that I haven't seen this thing in a case yet, but already it's like

1775
01:36:59,485 --> 01:37:03,345
Speaker 2:  to push it, to do the light tap, to bring up the, the various menus

1776
01:37:04,005 --> 01:37:07,545
Speaker 2:  or controls is already like, you have to think about how hard you're pushing

1777
01:37:07,565 --> 01:37:11,545
Speaker 2:  so you don't accidentally push the button. And so If you have a little play

1778
01:37:11,645 --> 01:37:15,305
Speaker 2:  and then you have to push like If you have a cheap case or a bad case that

1779
01:37:15,305 --> 01:37:17,665
Speaker 2:  might get weird remains to be seen.

1780
01:37:17,845 --> 01:37:20,225
Speaker 5:  That's why Beats is leading the way with how

1781
01:37:20,225 --> 01:37:21,385
Speaker 3:  Hard design. I don't beat has it covered?

1782
01:37:21,815 --> 01:37:22,105
Speaker 5:  They

1783
01:37:22,105 --> 01:37:23,985
Speaker 3:  Got Jimmy Iovine has it covered. Don't worry.

1784
01:37:25,485 --> 01:37:28,665
Speaker 2:  Do you think Jimmy Iovine's like ever just like looks in the direction of

1785
01:37:28,665 --> 01:37:30,505
Speaker 2:  Apple Park? He's like, man I really pulled one over.

1786
01:37:33,295 --> 01:37:33,745
Speaker 5:  Yeah, he's

1787
01:37:34,095 --> 01:37:35,985
Speaker 3:  Make all these almost funny and we still make headphones.

1788
01:37:36,415 --> 01:37:40,385
Speaker 2:  There's a, there was a brief, a real period a real thing that happened. Is

1789
01:37:40,385 --> 01:37:44,265
Speaker 2:  it Jimmy Iovine, Dr. Dre and Trent Resner were Apple employees and they had

1790
01:37:44,265 --> 01:37:46,185
Speaker 2:  no titles except for Jimmy and Dre.

1791
01:37:47,045 --> 01:37:48,945
Speaker 3:  Is that true though? That was their title. That

1792
01:37:48,945 --> 01:37:50,385
Speaker 2:  Was their title. Jimmy and Dre. That

1793
01:37:50,385 --> 01:37:53,225
Speaker 3:  Was the title. Well that's my name. Yeah. Was was Dre Jimmy and Jimmy was

1794
01:37:53,225 --> 01:37:55,205
Speaker 3:  Dre. That's the, that's what I want.

1795
01:37:55,435 --> 01:37:58,605
Speaker 2:  It'd be great if Apple is like another person gets the title of Dre when

1796
01:37:58,605 --> 01:37:59,045
Speaker 2:  Dre left

1797
01:38:02,105 --> 01:38:02,405
Speaker 1:  Ary. You

1798
01:38:02,405 --> 01:38:02,765
Speaker 3:  Gotta Dre.

1799
01:38:03,075 --> 01:38:03,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

1800
01:38:05,715 --> 01:38:08,765
Speaker 2:  There's some like brand new engineers like you're Dre now. Like

1801
01:38:10,155 --> 01:38:10,725
Speaker 2:  have fun

1802
01:38:11,395 --> 01:38:14,605
Speaker 5:  Just putting all those weights into a product to make it feel better.

1803
01:38:14,605 --> 01:38:18,525
Speaker 3:  Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Alright. We have gone way over. We all

1804
01:38:18,675 --> 01:38:22,605
Speaker 3:  need to go to sleep and Neli needs to go figure out how to move this lamp.

1805
01:38:22,755 --> 01:38:25,605
Speaker 3:  Neli. Any, any parting thoughts for us? Anything we missed? Keep the lamp.

1806
01:38:25,605 --> 01:38:28,005
Speaker 3:  Any big feelings about the, the Apple stuff today before we get outta here?

1807
01:38:28,505 --> 01:38:31,925
Speaker 2:  I'm very curious to see how people want us to, to evaluate these products,

1808
01:38:32,495 --> 01:38:35,965
Speaker 2:  right? Like I, I don't, I don't disagree with the sense that this was kind

1809
01:38:35,965 --> 01:38:39,885
Speaker 2:  of a, a small event in its way. I wonder if the

1810
01:38:39,885 --> 01:38:43,045
Speaker 2:  products will feel bigger with the Apple intelligence features. So let me

1811
01:38:43,045 --> 01:38:46,925
Speaker 2:  know how you want us to, to talk about these. 'cause I suspect the answer

1812
01:38:46,945 --> 01:38:47,165
Speaker 2:  is

1813
01:38:58,085 --> 01:39:01,925
Speaker 3:  that's like more than just my phone is dying,

1814
01:39:02,045 --> 01:39:05,245
Speaker 3:  I need a new one. I'll buy the new one. But is like, is this worth the upgrade?

1815
01:39:05,675 --> 01:39:08,765
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I, I wanna know all your questions about is this worth the upgrade?
