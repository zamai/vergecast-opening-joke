00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,900
Speaker 2:  Welcome to the Vergecast the flagship podcast of planned obsolescence. I'm

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,020
Speaker 2:  your friend, David Pierce. And as you probably know, there's a big apple

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,380
Speaker 2:  event coming up really soon. We're expecting new iPhones, new apple

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,980
Speaker 2:  watches, probably new AirPods, a bunch of new software, all kinds of stuff

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,460
Speaker 2:  coming. And that means it is time for what I have come to consider my

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,300
Speaker 2:  annual moral obligation, which is to go to the mall, go to the apple store

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,330
Speaker 2:  and tell everybody who's shopping for phones, not to buy a phone because

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,150
Speaker 2:  there's a new one. Just about to come out. We are also going to be spending

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,180
Speaker 2:  this show, talking about apple, but not so much the event. We didn't want

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,000
Speaker 2:  to make a bunch of predictions that turn out to be totally wrong or have

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,790
Speaker 2:  feelings about things we don't even necessarily know are coming yet. So we're

13
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,610
Speaker 2:  going to save that all for the Friday show. It's going to be a big one on

14
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,060
Speaker 2:  this show. We're going to talk more about apple in general. It's the most

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,270
Speaker 2:  valuable company on earth. It makes some of the most influential products

16
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,260
Speaker 2:  that anyone uses, and we want to get into where the company is right

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,950
Speaker 2:  now. What changes for apple now that it's so big and so popular? What are

18
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,460
Speaker 2:  the next big products for apple? Why is apple so obsessed with making TVs?

19
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,450
Speaker 2:  Why is Nila is so obsessed with apple being obsessed with making TVs? We're

20
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,180
Speaker 2:  going to get into all of that. I gave Nila and Alex some homework, which

21
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,690
Speaker 2:  was to come with big questions and just spicy,

22
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,500
Speaker 2:  spicy takes. And we're going to dig into all of the things we want to know

23
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,680
Speaker 2:  about the future of apple. But first, before we get to all of that, I need

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,380
Speaker 2:  to go save this person who looks like they're about to buy an iPhone 12,

25
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,650
Speaker 2:  which just honestly seems like a terrible idea. This is the Vergecast, we'll

26
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,560
Speaker 2:  be right back

27
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,880
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. Okay. Apple questions, apple hot takes. Let's do

28
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,570
Speaker 2:  this Nila. Hello? Hey buddy. Alex. Hello.

29
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:26,560
Speaker 2:  Hi. Both of you had homework, which was to come with

30
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,310
Speaker 2:  five big or small, but like open questions

31
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,370
Speaker 2:  about apple things you think are interesting going forward that we're paying

32
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,590
Speaker 2:  attention to. And we're going to talk about them and see if we have answers

33
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,770
Speaker 2:  for any of them. And then too, I think I called them overheated

34
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,860
Speaker 2:  takes, and I should just say right off the top, I'm just ruthlessly stealing

35
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,190
Speaker 2:  this from the ringer, done their fantasy football show. They have a thing

36
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,970
Speaker 2:  called the take purge, which is just a whole episode where the hosts

37
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,540
Speaker 2:  just say the things that they don't actually believe, but feel deep in their

38
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,540
Speaker 2:  bones anyway. So we're just going to, we're going to steal that from them

39
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,690
Speaker 2:  and do some overheat. It takes that you don't really believe, but you kind

40
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,200
Speaker 2:  of believe Alex, you started last, you did your

41
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,930
Speaker 2:  homework while we were sitting here getting ready to record. So you get to

42
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,530
Speaker 2:  go first. You get to present first because that's what the cool teacher does

43
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,350
Speaker 2:  is try to terrorize you in front of everybody.

44
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,410
Speaker 4:  I really want to know why everybody won't shut up about an apple car that

45
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,280
Speaker 4:  I have yet to see.

46
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,210
Speaker 2:  This was one of mine too, which is why am I supposed to care that the

47
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,440
Speaker 2:  apple car is a thing?

48
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,050
Speaker 4:  Like I can't care about it. It's hard.

49
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,960
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean, at this point, apple could just fall along with every other

50
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,290
Speaker 5:  car maker and just show us a 3d render of a car and be like, here's our

51
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,280
Speaker 5:  car. They would just match what every other car maker is doing. Give us a

52
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,970
Speaker 5:  hundred dollars on a pre-order in two years from now, maybe we'll ship a

53
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,460
Speaker 5:  car. And like, maybe that's actually a great business

54
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,180
Speaker 5:  model. I think a lot of people will give them a hundred bucks for a vendor.

55
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,990
Speaker 5:  I will answer your question with my first question has that. Yes. I think

56
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,500
Speaker 5:  this is a biggest open question for apple. Can they find another market?

57
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,130
Speaker 5:  That's big enough to make a dent and is that even the thing they should do?

58
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,580
Speaker 5:  So the reason they are chasing cars and the reason they are chasing health

59
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,360
Speaker 5:  and the reason they're chasing everything else they're doing is because

60
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,080
Speaker 5:  they need something that will generate enough money to be

61
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,950
Speaker 5:  like 10% of the biggest company that has ever existed on earth. And the

62
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,560
Speaker 5:  only way you can do that is if you eat a whole industry,

63
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,570
Speaker 4:  I know the industry though, it shouldn't be cars.

64
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,290
Speaker 5:  It's a,

65
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,170
Speaker 4:  It should be federal government, like

66
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,860
Speaker 4:  systems, like, you know, they, they got COBOL and all that stuff.

67
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,460
Speaker 4:  That's, that's basically dead. Nobody's running it. Apple could be that

68
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,990
Speaker 4:  company. Apple could do that.

69
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,590
Speaker 5:  It's all going to be swift UI. The buttons won't make any sense. Be every

70
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,950
Speaker 5:  couple of years, it'll change for no reason. Have you ever wanted to do an

71
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,910
Speaker 5:  insurance claim in piles? Now you can like, but that's, that's

72
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,660
Speaker 5:  their problem, right? Like the answer to why are they doing a car? Is the

73
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,620
Speaker 5:  car industry is big enough so that if you become a dominant player

74
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,520
Speaker 5:  in cars, you can tell your investors. You can tell your

75
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,150
Speaker 5:  employees. You can tell everybody who makes money on your stock. We have

76
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,960
Speaker 5:  growth here. That is meaningful. Yeah. I mean like every question I'm

77
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,590
Speaker 5:  asking, by the way, David, this is my warning to you. All of my

78
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,460
Speaker 5:  questions are just, will they make a TV expressed in slightly different ways?

79
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,220
Speaker 2:  That's good. Cause that's about half of mine too. So it's gonna be fine.

80
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,070
Speaker 2:  But no, I think it's funny. You bring that up. Cause I I've been rereading

81
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:12,340
Speaker 2:  the new, new thing, which is Michael Lewis's book from like the late nineties

82
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,300
Speaker 2:  about Jim Clark who founded Netscape. And it is like precisely

83
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,780
Speaker 2:  what you're describing. It's like guy starts a computer company gets very

84
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,930
Speaker 2:  big. Guy goes, okay, well what do I do next? I have to top that somehow.

85
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,290
Speaker 2:  So he starts an internet company, which feels very big, get, make some, a

86
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,390
Speaker 2:  lot of money gets very excited. And then he's like, okay, well what do I

87
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,290
Speaker 2:  do next? I have to build something even bigger. And he goes healthcare. And

88
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,380
Speaker 2:  it's just like, that is the thing, right? It is like, it is this massive

89
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,380
Speaker 2:  industry that seems like it's a mess. And everyone who is like, well, if

90
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,470
Speaker 2:  I can just take a slice of that, I can make a lot of money and I seem smart.

91
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,740
Speaker 2:  So I bet I can convince somebody that this is plausible. It's like, there's

92
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,670
Speaker 2:  only a handful of those. And I feel like cars is one of them and

93
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:52,180
Speaker 2:  health is one of them. And so it makes sense that apple just has to keep

94
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,780
Speaker 2:  like pointing at those things how serious it is, is hard to

95
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,630
Speaker 2:  know. It seems very serious in a way that you can be very serious when you're

96
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,620
Speaker 2:  the richest company on planet earth. But I don't know how much

97
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,370
Speaker 2:  I'm supposed to believe that there is ever going to be like a good car that

98
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,910
Speaker 2:  people care about and drive that apple makes, I have no idea.

99
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,390
Speaker 4:  Couldn't it be like Sony? And they just like pivot to party

100
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,470
Speaker 4:  speakers

101
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,920
Speaker 5:  As always. I renew my call that if you are on the Sony party speaker team

102
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,860
Speaker 5:  and you've been in the meeting in which the third generation of party speakers

103
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,730
Speaker 5:  has been greenlit, I'll give you the whole show. You'll get a week long of

104
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,570
Speaker 5:  at Vergecast episodes just to talk about that product. So Sony is like the

105
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,380
Speaker 5:  classic example though. We don't perceive Sony this way in this

106
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,100
Speaker 5:  country, but Sony historically its balance sheet

107
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,060
Speaker 5:  is it's a big insurance company in Japan that happens

108
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,480
Speaker 5:  to make TVs and party speakers, right? And they pivoted that

109
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,200
Speaker 5:  company to a much larger business because the

110
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,500
Speaker 5:  consumer business was fading. And that's like, I don't think apple should

111
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,430
Speaker 5:  sell life insurance, which is something Sony sells in Japan.

112
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:59,360
Speaker 5:  But you can see why they're moving in the same general direction,

113
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,930
Speaker 5:  which are, what are the next biggest industries? And we had trip metal on

114
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,750
Speaker 5:  the verge house several months ago. I was just flipping through his book

115
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,810
Speaker 5:  again about apple after Steve, which is excellent. And like, this is

116
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,470
Speaker 5:  explicit in Apple's thought process in Tim Cook's thought

117
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,250
Speaker 5:  process. What is the next biggest market I can go after? Right?

118
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,210
Speaker 5:  Because we, in order to grow, we have to attack the big markets. That

119
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,540
Speaker 5:  is what led to the car. It is what has led to a bunch of their health efforts,

120
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,440
Speaker 5:  which by the way, everyone also keeps talking about and has generated virtually

121
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,800
Speaker 5:  nothing. And to some extent, it's why they went to watches instead of

122
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,550
Speaker 5:  TVs.

123
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,850
Speaker 4:  Well, and it's also why they went to entertainment, right? Like it's why

124
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,470
Speaker 4:  they went into that space to

125
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:40,160
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That's why they went to services. Yep. They were just chasing

126
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,120
Speaker 5:  revenue. And I don't mean like usually when we say that, we mean that is

127
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,840
Speaker 5:  like cynically as possible, but in the case of apple, like they

128
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,830
Speaker 5:  really had to go chase growth because they were already so big

129
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:55,310
Speaker 5:  that trying to find another category as big as the iPhone was a less good

130
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,430
Speaker 5:  option than selling iPhone customers. More things

131
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,030
Speaker 4:  Like, I guess this is not one of my five questions. This is a

132
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,860
Speaker 4:  brand new, fresh question. Oh

133
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,280
Speaker 5:  Boy.

134
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,700
Speaker 4:  Why are they pursuing these really known

135
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,420
Speaker 4:  categories when they effectively invented some

136
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,720
Speaker 4:  categories? Right? Like apple figured those out and did them really well.

137
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,290
Speaker 4:  And in these other cases, apple is going to like places where there's a really

138
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,190
Speaker 4:  established competitors, like what is the disruption to

139
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:26,030
Speaker 4:  be had? And Apple's like, I know we're going to disrupt cars.

140
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,450
Speaker 4:  There's feels like there's lower hanging fruit to go disrupt.

141
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,940
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But they're all smaller. I think that's even the TV industry is like

142
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,450
Speaker 5:  too small. That's why apple won't do it. Right. And it's th that doesn't

143
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,840
Speaker 5:  turn over enough and people aren't shopping on their TVs enough. Like they

144
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,740
Speaker 5:  can't make the case that getting that screen in everyone's living room

145
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,770
Speaker 5:  is more valuable than the screen they already have in everyone's living room,

146
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,680
Speaker 5:  which is the phone. Right. So they might as well just put their software

147
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,650
Speaker 5:  on other people's hardware and then do whatever they're going to do there.

148
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,680
Speaker 5:  Right. There just aren't many industries that are bigger than the

149
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,470
Speaker 5:  iPhone. And so like, they are, you know, they are inventing, you know,

150
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,470
Speaker 5:  AR glasses. We know they are heard about them. They're going to start with

151
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,530
Speaker 5:  mixed reality. And they're trying to invent a big new category. I just think

152
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,740
Speaker 5:  in the meantime, cause that's going to take a long time in the meantime,

153
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,920
Speaker 5:  right? They're trying to run some of the playbook that they've run, which

154
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,820
Speaker 5:  is everybody hates the software in their car. What if apple did it? Everybody

155
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,570
Speaker 5:  hates their mobile phone when apple, like they want apple to

156
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,100
Speaker 5:  replace their razor.

157
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,280
Speaker 2:  Speaking of big industries, that apple should be playing more into my first

158
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,270
Speaker 2:  question, which is when is apple going to get like actually serious about

159
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,230
Speaker 2:  winning at video games? Video games is a gigantic industry. Apple

160
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,800
Speaker 2:  arcade is like kind of working. And to me it's like stop making

161
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,640
Speaker 2:  fancy TV shows that win awards, but nobody cares about, and like go

162
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,540
Speaker 2:  buy some video games, like make me a game console,

163
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,470
Speaker 2:  do a game streaming thing. Like give one whole shit about gaming. And it

164
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,540
Speaker 2:  seems like apple has like real moves to make here.

165
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,960
Speaker 4:  I think there's a lot of problems though. Right? Microsoft and other companies

166
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,740
Speaker 4:  have consolidated that industry a lot. It's a lot smaller industry than it

167
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,280
Speaker 4:  was. And we talked about indie games and everything, but indie games are

168
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,830
Speaker 4:  a relatively small piece of that puzzle. Most people are like call of duty

169
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:05,520
Speaker 4:  and all of that. And Microsoft is up there being like, Nope, we'll take that.

170
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,490
Speaker 4:  We'll take that. And also they're watching Google.

171
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:12,510
Speaker 4:  They've seen like Google went and was like, yeah, we're going to get serious

172
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:16,500
Speaker 4:  about video games. And for most people serious equates with consoles and

173
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,160
Speaker 4:  doing these big immersive, you know, 20 hour experiences,

174
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,150
Speaker 4:  not what Apple's really good at, which is mobile gaming. And I think they're

175
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:28,020
Speaker 4:  the biggest in mobile gaming. They're the most successful. So if that

176
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,950
Speaker 4:  serious is console gaming, that would be so bad for them.

177
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,580
Speaker 5:  Well, I mean, there's still a lot of transactions that take place in consoles,

178
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,910
Speaker 5:  right? The future of all this though, it has to be streaming. So they're

179
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,330
Speaker 5:  going to do something. I don't think they're going to ship AMD

180
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:46,260
Speaker 5:  processors in a box that runs an operating system that

181
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,950
Speaker 5:  is, will largely irrelevant to them playing a game

182
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:53,670
Speaker 2:  Apple's version of game pass feels like where it would have to go.

183
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,690
Speaker 4:  Isn't that arcade?

184
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,630
Speaker 5:  It is, but that's for mobile games. I think David's question is like, why

185
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:01,170
Speaker 5:  is it that this huge industry that's growing primarily based on

186
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,830
Speaker 5:  microtransactions, right? Fortnite is free and you buy stuff in Fortnite.

187
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,610
Speaker 5:  Like the apple and epic are in a gigantic fight over the fees of buying things

188
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,450
Speaker 5:  in fortnight. But epic happily pays the fees to Sony in epic. Happily pays

189
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,930
Speaker 5:  the fees to Microsoft. Why won't apple get to that next

190
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,770
Speaker 5:  turn and be like, now, when you play games in your living room,

191
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,310
Speaker 5:  aren't you paying us fees. And I think the answer is they just

192
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,610
Speaker 5:  can't see it. Like it's been three decades of this

193
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:30,390
Speaker 5:  question, right? They deprecated open GL. They went with

194
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,230
Speaker 5:  metal, no one went to metal with them. They had their own wacky GPU

195
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,860
Speaker 5:  ideas. The industries, they hate Nvidia. They just hate

196
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,700
Speaker 5:  Nvidia. At one time, Nvidia made some GPU's that made Mac books get hot and

197
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,400
Speaker 5:  apple is never free. And there was a recall and Apple's never forgiven that

198
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,850
Speaker 5:  company. And they're like, literally is dead to them. It's 100% what

199
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,530
Speaker 5:  happened. And it's just like their aversion to the two,

200
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:55,390
Speaker 5:  doing the foundational work to be good at games in the current

201
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,790
Speaker 5:  ecosystem of games has kept them away from forever. I don't think they're

202
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:02,620
Speaker 5:  averse to let's build a data center and run games there and

203
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,500
Speaker 5:  stream them to you. But even that data center, what do you need to fill it

204
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,010
Speaker 5:  full of other people's GPU's you need that data center probably needs to

205
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,880
Speaker 5:  run open. Like it needs to run direct X, like whatever it is, the games

206
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,720
Speaker 5:  run on, because none of Apple's foundational technologies can run the games.

207
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,590
Speaker 4:  It comes down to that courting of those, those developers and

208
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:24,550
Speaker 4:  those studios. Right. And apple has very little interest there.

209
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,340
Speaker 4:  Like they they've worked with them, they got Capcom to do stuff. They've

210
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,460
Speaker 4:  gotten these big studios that we all know to do. Some

211
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,090
Speaker 4:  development, produce some games for arcade, but they're a

212
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:37,930
Speaker 4:  meme in, in the game development space. Everybody's like, oh yeah, apple,

213
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,710
Speaker 4:  one day they'll do gaming. And I don't know how apple could ever

214
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:45,550
Speaker 4:  show that it's serious enough for them to believe it. Especially after we

215
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,760
Speaker 4:  saw like Google, be like, yeah, we're serious about gaming and

216
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,240
Speaker 4:  stadia frequently becomes a punchline. Sorry. So when I say,

217
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,020
Speaker 4:  oh, no one mentioned stadia on this. A bunch of stadia fans come into my

218
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,630
Speaker 4:  Twitter to say that I clearly hate stadia.

219
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,580
Speaker 2:  All four of them that exist. Yeah.

220
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,910
Speaker 4:  All four of them are, they're saying I hate stadia, but

221
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,720
Speaker 4:  like it's, you know, big tech has kind of shown that they want to be

222
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,000
Speaker 4:  interested in this space because they know it's funny, Amazon's doing the

223
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,870
Speaker 4:  same thing with Luna. Right. And they're doing it really badly. The

224
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,860
Speaker 4:  Stu everybody isn't participating the few who are like Ubisoft, one of

225
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,280
Speaker 4:  the biggest game development studios. Yeah. They'll do it. There'll be on

226
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,850
Speaker 4:  everything. Sure. You can play Assassin's creed on every device that was

227
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:25,690
Speaker 4:  ever made

228
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,440
Speaker 5:  And notably Ubisoft as an indie. Right. I mean, they need

229
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,940
Speaker 5:  that widespread support.

230
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,690
Speaker 4:  And most like the consolidation of the industry means that it's just really

231
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,260
Speaker 4:  hard for apple, even if it did decide to be serious about it. And

232
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,660
Speaker 4:  Microsoft is just this elephant in the room,

233
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,560
Speaker 2:  Alex, I think to your point, like the 30 years of not doing this is a

234
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,540
Speaker 2:  really interesting point that I had not thought of. Cause it seems to me

235
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,210
Speaker 2:  like what we're talking about streaming is like, this is the moment, right?

236
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:53,080
Speaker 2:  Like if you're ever going to say we apple are serious about like turning

237
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,920
Speaker 2:  the apple TV into a game console, which they've like hinted at before, I'd

238
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,190
Speaker 2:  never done in any real way. Game streaming would be the moment to be like

239
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,850
Speaker 2:  this technology all exists. We have an unusual ability to make it all

240
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,690
Speaker 2:  work. And I, one of my like throw away overly hot

241
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:11,470
Speaker 2:  takes was that if apple and epic weren't being sued,

242
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:14,500
Speaker 2:  apple would have just bought epic by now, which I have no reason to believe.

243
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,680
Speaker 2:  That's true. But it's just like, that is a neat solution to a lot of like

244
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,680
Speaker 2:  things that apple wants to be in the future. I, it is an interesting point.

245
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,220
Speaker 2:  I wonder if anyone would take apple seriously, if they were like, we care

246
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,080
Speaker 2:  about games now everybody like, yeah. Okay.

247
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,980
Speaker 4:  They also did this big fight too. Right? They did this fight with Microsoft

248
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,980
Speaker 4:  and Sadia and all the other streamers where they were like, no, we don't

249
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,310
Speaker 4:  want you on our service because we don't get a cut of it. And you bypass

250
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,760
Speaker 4:  us entirely. We don't want that. And they were all like, yes, we are not

251
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,600
Speaker 4:  going to give you a cut of a $60 game that somebody buys on our service F

252
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,570
Speaker 4:  off. We're just going to run out of the browser. And I think apple has to

253
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:50,230
Speaker 4:  make a really compelling case for why these companies don't need to run off

254
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,960
Speaker 4:  the browser anymore. And apple, isn't going to do that because apple wants

255
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,380
Speaker 4:  a cut of the money. And what is the cut that Microsoft and

256
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,310
Speaker 4:  Google are willing to say? Yeah, I'll pay that to get my stuff on the apple

257
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,030
Speaker 4:  TV.

258
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,690
Speaker 5:  Well, so I'll give you this example though. Microsoft is going to ship

259
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:09,560
Speaker 5:  X-Box game, pass the streaming version. There's like a lot of bad

260
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,370
Speaker 5:  names in Microsoft world. So Xbox streaming, let's just call it that

261
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,270
Speaker 5:  they have been hinting. Phil Spencer's said it on decoder. Like

262
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:21,140
Speaker 5:  they're gonna put it on smart TVs. Yeah. It's coming. And so that's a

263
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,930
Speaker 5:  deal you gotta make with a smart TV vendor. You got to go to a Samsung and

264
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:27,500
Speaker 5:  LG and Sony, whoever and say, okay, we're going to start

265
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,070
Speaker 5:  transacting on your platform. And you know, there's some business relationship

266
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:34,760
Speaker 5:  there for sure. You could make that deal with an apple. Microsoft could make

267
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,790
Speaker 5:  that deal with an apple and say, okay, we want to be in your box too. And

268
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,580
Speaker 5:  we want to string games and apple could make that deal with Microsoft and

269
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,540
Speaker 5:  say, okay, like, please don't take office away. We'll let you onto our

270
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,840
Speaker 5:  thing. Like there's a lot of leverage on both sides of that agreement, right?

271
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,200
Speaker 5:  On both sides of that relationship. And what are the terms who knows the

272
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,980
Speaker 5:  hard part for apple is apple now runs

273
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,340
Speaker 5:  effectively a nation state on its phone,

274
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,310
Speaker 5:  where it makes effectively legal

275
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:05,060
Speaker 5:  decisions. And there's a lot of government regulators and

276
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,900
Speaker 5:  lawsuits that look at those decisions and epic will say, why

277
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,710
Speaker 5:  does Microsoft get this preferred treatment? And we don't and

278
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,380
Speaker 5:  Google will say it, and Amazon will say it. And once you do that, now you've

279
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,800
Speaker 5:  just opened the door to it, to game streaming on your platform. And you don't

280
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,430
Speaker 5:  get to see inside of the transactions. And I think apple is just like kind

281
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:26,210
Speaker 5:  of hamstrung to make a, what should be a no-brainer deal

282
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:30,200
Speaker 5:  with Microsoft to say, X-Box games streaming now available

283
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,130
Speaker 5:  on the iPhone. And that's kind of a no brainer deal for Microsoft,

284
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:37,940
Speaker 5:  right? Like, but I think the larger context is then

285
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,750
Speaker 5:  people on a podcast like this will show up and say, what is game streaming?

286
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,140
Speaker 5:  And why? Like, why doesn't it? Why, why can't I stream apps to the

287
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,830
Speaker 5:  phone and transact inside of the apps? Like, what is it, what is a

288
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:52,820
Speaker 5:  game, but a type of application, right? And you just end up apple in

289
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,360
Speaker 5:  particular right now ends up having to defend these very fine

290
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,290
Speaker 5:  gradations between the kinds of code that run on its platform.

291
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,740
Speaker 2:  It makes sense. Okay. We should keep moving. Nia. We like only

292
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,040
Speaker 2:  halfway did your questions to give us another one. What's what's on your

293
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,580
Speaker 2:  list.

294
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,500
Speaker 5:  Well, this one just says, why don't you build a

295
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,460
Speaker 5:  TV on this thread? I think apple

296
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:17,390
Speaker 5:  overreacts to external competitors, the iPhone a lot. Yes.

297
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,200
Speaker 5:  They tow into things and then they, they realize it's not a real

298
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,830
Speaker 5:  threat. And then they back off in the product fails. And the thing I'm

299
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,710
Speaker 5:  specifically thinking about is the home pod, right? They were early with

300
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,920
Speaker 5:  Siri and then Amazon shut up with Alexa and Google shut up with

301
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,850
Speaker 5:  assistant and apple completely overreacts to it. Right? They think series

302
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:38,000
Speaker 5:  should do all the same things. Those products should do. They rush out the

303
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,690
Speaker 5:  home pod, which had been brewing in the background forever and they

304
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,750
Speaker 5:  couldn't get it together. And they finally are like, all right, we're just

305
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,090
Speaker 5:  gonna let this team do it. And they ship it. And then they're like, wait,

306
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:50,730
Speaker 5:  these things are not actually eating the iPhone. It turns out an Amazon,

307
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:54,720
Speaker 5:  Alexa is not a viable replacement for the iPhone, even in

308
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,500
Speaker 5:  your home. It's, they're very useful. And people like them and

309
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,920
Speaker 5:  Amazon is, it has nowhere else to bet. So it's going to bet on it. I don't

310
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,610
Speaker 5:  know what Google is doing this assistant neglecting it, I think is the

311
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,450
Speaker 5:  answer it's

312
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,110
Speaker 2:  Around,

313
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:11,040
Speaker 5:  It's around, but you just see apple kind of like rushed itself into a corner

314
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,920
Speaker 5:  and then forgot to iterate because there was no, the pressure didn't actually

315
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,400
Speaker 5:  exist to compete. And I think this is just sort of a pattern with them. And

316
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,790
Speaker 5:  so the one I would give you right now is we keep hearing about AR

317
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:24,600
Speaker 5:  from literally mark Zuckerberg on the short Rogan podcast. And

318
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,470
Speaker 5:  apple seems like they're gonna get to market with a super

319
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:32,100
Speaker 5:  expensive mixed reality headset. I'll see if it's reported on it. And it

320
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,000
Speaker 5:  just feels like, are they, is this also an overreaction? Yes. Is it?

321
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,630
Speaker 5:  They're so afraid of not being dominant in the end that they're

322
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,080
Speaker 5:  gonna make a move and then recognize the pressure isn't there. And then like,

323
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,800
Speaker 5:  let it wither away, which I think is more or less what happened at home.

324
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,670
Speaker 2:  I would also put the watch in that category as things that were kind

325
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:54,540
Speaker 2:  of an overreaction to what apple saw as the thing that

326
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,150
Speaker 2:  might kill the iPhone. Like there was, there was that moment where it was

327
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,330
Speaker 2:  like, okay, the future of this all is wearables, right? It's like biometric

328
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:04,320
Speaker 2:  sensing, more accessible computers on your body. And that was

329
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,140
Speaker 2:  the thing that was going to kill the iPhone. As we've discussed many times

330
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,800
Speaker 5:  Tablets. I think they did that to the Mac in some way. Right. They went all

331
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,170
Speaker 5:  in on tablets. Cause I thought it was going to eat the Mac. And then it turns

332
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,140
Speaker 5:  out the Mac was surprising, re resilient,

333
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,400
Speaker 2:  And then they made the mat good again. And people liked it. Like it turns

334
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,230
Speaker 2:  out if you just make it good, people will like it. No, I mean, I think the,

335
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:23,490
Speaker 2:  the flip side of that is that the iPhone has been like

336
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:27,330
Speaker 2:  astoundingly durable over time. Like a lot of things have shown up and

337
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:31,230
Speaker 2:  nothing has even been any kind of real threat. If anything

338
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,410
Speaker 2:  else, everything else that has happened has like entrenched the smartphone

339
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:38,040
Speaker 2:  because it is now like the center of all of these universes that like you

340
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,910
Speaker 2:  manage Alexa on your phone. Like, that's how you do Alexa. You

341
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:45,750
Speaker 2:  talk to it on the thing. But you do all the Alexa work on your phone.

342
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,120
Speaker 2:  And apple has always talked about this, right? That like, if you don't cannibalize

343
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,020
Speaker 2:  your own stuff, somebody else will. But it does kind of feel like

344
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,920
Speaker 2:  apple is, is like chasing its own demise. Even when it's not

345
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,780
Speaker 2:  there, like sees boogeyman everywhere.

346
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,050
Speaker 5:  If you don't cannibalize your own thing, somebody else was as a statement

347
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:04,350
Speaker 5:  of confidence. Sure. We know what's next. We're going to make the thing.

348
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:08,070
Speaker 5:  That's so good that people won't buy the old thing anymore. And usually the

349
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:11,910
Speaker 5:  times they have said that we're Steve jobs introducing a slightly

350
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,390
Speaker 5:  smaller iPod. Yeah. It's just like

351
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:19,200
Speaker 5:  historically when apple says that thing, it's

352
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,810
Speaker 5:  right. They made a big thing. And now they've made a small thing. That's

353
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:25,560
Speaker 5:  like 85% as good as the big thing. Like that's the iPod to the iPad mini

354
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,460
Speaker 5:  that's the mini to the nano, you know, Mac book to Mac book air, right? Like

355
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,550
Speaker 5:  there's a pattern to when they say that, but it's usually within the same

356
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:36,420
Speaker 5:  category. They've rarely done it outside the category, even the

357
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,290
Speaker 5:  iPhone. So the Mac book wasn't that thing in that

358
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,260
Speaker 5:  moment. Right? They were like, here's a phone, you have to plug it into your

359
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,500
Speaker 5:  computer to set it up. It took a decade to get

360
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,350
Speaker 5:  there. And so I just think lately apple has been, it's been reactive to

361
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,130
Speaker 5:  perceived threats instead of creating its own. I mean, this is my other

362
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,370
Speaker 5:  big question is who will take, take over after Tim cook?

363
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,460
Speaker 2:  Ooh. Okay, wait, let's come back to that one. First. We're going to take

364
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,030
Speaker 2:  a break. We'll be right

365
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:07,260
Speaker 2:  back.

366
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:01,040
Speaker 2:  We're back. Okay. So who takes over after Tim cook? Do you have a theory

367
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,460
Speaker 2:  on this or is this just a genuinely open question?

368
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,590
Speaker 5:  My, my theory is that a chef Williams,

369
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:10,520
Speaker 7:  We just focused on making products that we're excited about and let the

370
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,230
Speaker 7:  chips fall where they may.

371
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:15,230
Speaker 2:  Yeah. That's he seems to be like the leader in the clubhouse. Yeah.

372
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,020
Speaker 5:  It seems like the leader in the clubhouse, everyone really likes him. He's

373
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,920
Speaker 5:  been becoming more and more prominent, which is a very only apple cuts. That

374
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,740
Speaker 5:  kind of attention. Right. You can measure the amount of minutes people get

375
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:28,130
Speaker 5:  on stage right back. I'll be the new CEO. Like no other company does that

376
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:31,670
Speaker 5:  or very few. But Jeff Williams is almost as old as Tim cook.

377
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:34,520
Speaker 4:  That seems to be like the big reasoning, right. That everybody says he's

378
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,270
Speaker 4:  not going to be. The person is because we'd be just having the conversation

379
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,350
Speaker 4:  in two years.

380
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:43,040
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Or, or five or whatever. I mean, they're not like elderly. There's

381
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,970
Speaker 5:  no like 60 five-year-old apple. It's not a 1960s iron

382
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:50,750
Speaker 5:  planet or whatever. Take your watch and leave. Yeah, exactly. It's him

383
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,390
Speaker 5:  cook. Keep going. He's told care social in the past, he doesn't expect to

384
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,060
Speaker 5:  be doing it for another 10 years. So there is some sort of looming event.

385
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,450
Speaker 5:  Jeff Williams is a natural choice, but again, it's are you getting five years?

386
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:03,380
Speaker 5:  Are you getting 15 years? It will he be as successful? Right? Like every

387
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,370
Speaker 5:  leader changes the culture of the organization. That's just true. Again,

388
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:10,280
Speaker 5:  Tripp's book is basically a book about how Tim cook changed the culture of

389
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,240
Speaker 5:  apple to focus more on growing products are still good, but like

390
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,840
Speaker 5:  that's the whole book. Yeah. I think it is a remarkable open

391
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,680
Speaker 5:  question because Tim cook inherited the company

392
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,490
Speaker 5:  from Steve jobs, but whoever takes over the company next we'll inherit it

393
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:26,540
Speaker 5:  from Tim cook.

394
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,500
Speaker 2:  What is the like overall sense of, of sort

395
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,920
Speaker 2:  of what Jeff Williams thing is? Cause right. Like Steve jobs was like the

396
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,190
Speaker 2:  visionary and then Tim cook was like the ruthless executer. Right. That was

397
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,680
Speaker 2:  like, when he came in, that was like, what everybody understood was like,

398
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,640
Speaker 2:  it is now Tim Cook's job. He is the, the operations king of the

399
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,480
Speaker 2:  universe. He's the

400
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,890
Speaker 5:  Supply chains guy.

401
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,770
Speaker 2:  Yeah. He's just going to come and make this, the tightest most efficient

402
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:52,280
Speaker 2:  company in the world, which like by all accounts he has basically

403
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,000
Speaker 2:  done. Is there a thing floating around about Jeff Williams in that sense?

404
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,440
Speaker 2:  Like, does he have a vibe?

405
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,280
Speaker 5:  No. Right. I think that's by design. Okay. I don't think there's

406
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,500
Speaker 5:  any way you could describe the CEO of apple is just a

407
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,490
Speaker 5:  guy that's not right. But I, I think

408
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:11,090
Speaker 5:  apple is a very secretive company. They show you who they want to show

409
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:14,960
Speaker 5:  you. Even Tim cook, he does not get onstage and be like this next

410
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,920
Speaker 5:  iPhone. I squeezed 3 cents of margin out of a tiny supplier

411
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,780
Speaker 5:  in Asia you share, heard of, and to apple at our scale that represents $5

412
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,840
Speaker 5:  billion, right? Like that's his thing. I think there's a real

413
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,590
Speaker 5:  sense that Jeff Williams is that person. He still does that

414
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,220
Speaker 5:  thing there. They apparently bile conflict similar in that way. And I

415
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:38,180
Speaker 5:  think it is true that apple is not apple without that

416
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,870
Speaker 5:  operational excellence. Like you cannot be the company that

417
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:45,650
Speaker 5:  ships a billion iPhones every minute and then a new one every

418
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:49,370
Speaker 5:  year, unless actually the core of the company is operations, right?

419
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:53,360
Speaker 5:  And supply chain management and logistics management. Like they

420
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,480
Speaker 5:  operate at a skeleton in comprehensible to anyone else. So I think maybe

421
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,170
Speaker 5:  you need, you just need a leader who respects that. And I buy all kinds of

422
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:03,410
Speaker 5:  jobs respected that element of cook, but jobs never ran a company as big

423
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:06,560
Speaker 5:  as apple. So now Tim cook runs a company that's as big as Tim cook made the

424
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,070
Speaker 5:  company. Who are you going to find to do that? There might only be one natural

425
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:13,670
Speaker 5:  choice versus somebody who existed in that company already.

426
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:17,480
Speaker 5:  Because again, what are the other companies at this scale? And it's like,

427
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,810
Speaker 5:  oh, you really do have to go find a defense contractor

428
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:24,590
Speaker 5:  executive to manage something this complicated and

429
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:28,340
Speaker 5:  managed by the way, your geopolitical relationship with China and

430
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:32,330
Speaker 5:  sit down on Trump's right hand when Trump is like, I'm going to ban every

431
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:35,840
Speaker 5:  import from China and get them to, to back off like that. These are all things

432
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,770
Speaker 5:  Tim cook had to do, right. That have almost nothing to do with are

433
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:43,290
Speaker 5:  the icons on the iPhone. And he did. Yeah. And partially I think his skill

434
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:46,680
Speaker 5:  is like letting that be to maybe his detriment, because I don't know if you

435
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,080
Speaker 5:  have seen some of apple software design and recently

436
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,910
Speaker 2:  The icons are

437
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,080
Speaker 5:  A little, all over the place. I

438
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,830
Speaker 4:  Love a pile.

439
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:56,010
Speaker 5:  Right. But like they are still doing it at that scale, which is, I think

440
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,000
Speaker 5:  is the victory.

441
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Speaker 2:  Okay. So Alex now it's your turn. What's next? What do you got?

442
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,220
Speaker 4:  Yeah, this one's kind of adjacent to some of the stuff we've been talking

443
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,700
Speaker 4:  about, but can apple like do the whole, we love

444
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,660
Speaker 4:  privacy. We care about privacy. We are your privacy. Warrior's

445
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:13,140
Speaker 4:  protecting you from everybody, infiltrating you. And also do the ad

446
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,440
Speaker 4:  business. They're quietly growing, maybe not quietly growing, but they're

447
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,010
Speaker 4:  definitely growing an ad business.

448
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,710
Speaker 2:  It's like increasingly not quiet.

449
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:23,070
Speaker 4:  It kind of reminds me of the whole Google do no evil, but also be the biggest

450
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:26,100
Speaker 4:  ad business in the world. And eventually they had to decide and they said

451
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,670
Speaker 4:  money.

452
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:29,520
Speaker 2:  Yeah. They said, oh, we're, don't be evil. It's not a thing anymore for us.

453
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,420
Speaker 2:  It's like, cool, Google. That's a good look. I kind of think no. And I think

454
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:37,140
Speaker 2:  even just on like a public perception level, like I think we've seen that

455
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,470
Speaker 2:  as possible to do good advertising in a more privacy preserving way, right?

456
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:43,920
Speaker 2:  Like how well you can do that remains to be seen. But like, there are ways

457
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,880
Speaker 2:  to do ads that are not as sketchy feeling as the way that

458
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,330
Speaker 2:  like Facebook and Google have done ads over time. But from a public

459
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,840
Speaker 2:  perception standpoint, I think it's very hard to be

460
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,680
Speaker 2:  simultaneously the privacy company and shove more

461
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,490
Speaker 2:  personalized ads into people's apps. I think people are just like awake to

462
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:05,880
Speaker 2:  what that is now and what it feels like. And I think it's really

463
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,840
Speaker 2:  hard, even if you're doing both of those things genuinely, I don't

464
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,850
Speaker 2:  think people will believe you anymore.

465
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:15,840
Speaker 5:  Right. The evidence of your privacy being violated is you talk

466
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,830
Speaker 5:  to someone and then an app shows you an ad for something that

467
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,230
Speaker 5:  you just talked about. Right. And then it's like, oh, Instagram is listening

468
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:25,020
Speaker 5:  to me. And whether I answered them as listening to your, not whether it actually

469
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,570
Speaker 5:  just happens to be your two people in your twenties, in the same place at

470
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:30,090
Speaker 5:  the same time. And of course you're talking about spring break,

471
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:33,990
Speaker 5:  like, right. Like maybe the answer is like, everyone's a

472
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,420
Speaker 5:  little bit more predictable than they think, right. Or maybe the answer is

473
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,540
Speaker 5:  that mark Zuckerberg has a microphone embedded in your body. Like no one

474
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,690
Speaker 5:  really knows. Right. But the answer is usually like you showed up at your

475
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:45,840
Speaker 5:  friend's wifi network. We assume the thing that your friend is searching

476
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,780
Speaker 5:  for is the thing that you are searching for and what a

477
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,050
Speaker 5:  coincidence to happen to talk to you about the thing that they were searching

478
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:55,500
Speaker 5:  for. Right? Like, right. That's usually the, how that goes. I think

479
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,220
Speaker 5:  apple, right. They're going to claim they have defined tracking

480
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:03,210
Speaker 5:  is taking data from the user and then using it somewhere else. There is no

481
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:06,570
Speaker 5:  somewhere else for apple. They, they like the definition of

482
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,690
Speaker 5:  tracking does not apply to data that remains in the apple

483
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:12,960
Speaker 5:  ecosystem. So they're like, we're not tracking you. We're just keeping it

484
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,230
Speaker 5:  all in house. And it never leaves here. But then the outcome is going to

485
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:20,040
Speaker 5:  be personalized advertising, which the other process is the

486
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,250
Speaker 5:  data goes everywhere. Right? I don't think they can do it unless they, and

487
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,100
Speaker 5:  this is just, I think this will be hard for apple. You can't, if you're like,

488
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,520
Speaker 5:  we're the privacy company, you're promises, we never use your data. And you

489
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,940
Speaker 5:  can keep that promise because the evidence of your data not being used is

490
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,860
Speaker 5:  easy to see. It's proving a negative in some way, but like there's no personalization

491
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:40,800
Speaker 5:  really. Once you start using the data, now you have to like, let an art,

492
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,710
Speaker 5:  you have let some independent auditor in to prove it out.

493
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,980
Speaker 5:  Like here's where the data goes. Here's how apple uses the data. Here's how

494
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,010
Speaker 5:  the ads are generated. Like we understand the system and it's as private

495
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:55,000
Speaker 5:  as they say, apple can make that claim. But unless you have a third party

496
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,840
Speaker 5:  of some kind validating that it's true. You just end up back with personalized

497
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,040
Speaker 5:  advertising. That feels,

498
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,700
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I was thinking about this with all in the context of all these like

499
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,730
Speaker 2:  privacy companies who are now starting to say, like, we don't collect your

500
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:10,120
Speaker 2:  data. We don't want your data. We don't want to do anything with your data.

501
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,970
Speaker 2:  Like we are taking all the steps we possibly can to avoid getting it in the

502
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,600
Speaker 2:  first place. And that was like a thing that apple could have started to pretty

503
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,210
Speaker 2:  credibly say for a long time where they're like, we have no use for your

504
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:22,660
Speaker 2:  data except to like help you with these small things in Siri. Right? So like,

505
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:26,200
Speaker 2:  if you want to opt into that, great, if not, no problem. The rest of it,

506
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,190
Speaker 2:  we don't even want to know, like we have no upside to allowing our

507
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:34,060
Speaker 2:  stuff to listen to you 24 7, because we wouldn't want to know. And now there

508
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,900
Speaker 2:  is an upside, like there's a reason apple would do that. And even if it doesn't,

509
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,900
Speaker 2:  it's still, it just becomes much harder to prove that you're not doing it

510
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,670
Speaker 2:  when you have a reason to be doing it.

511
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:46,000
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And they were going to hire Antonio Garcia,

512
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,630
Speaker 5:  Martinez from Facebook to build an ads business. Like it is not

513
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:53,140
Speaker 5:  quiet, what they're doing. I think they'd just have to prove that they don't

514
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,920
Speaker 5:  need the giant weird third party data brokers to do

515
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,010
Speaker 5:  it. And maybe they, you know, maybe they don't, but that's not a claim you

516
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,770
Speaker 5:  should just trust. That's a claim you should trust when someone else goes

517
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:05,200
Speaker 5:  in and investigates and tells you it's true.

518
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,040
Speaker 2:  My next one. Cause I think it's my turn is, do we want a

519
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,000
Speaker 2:  new idea for an iPhone it's iPhone season? You know, everybody's like, this

520
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,580
Speaker 2:  is the year. It's a, this is a tick year. We're going to get to redesign

521
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,070
Speaker 2:  new ideas. Everything's going to be great. And part of me is like, maybe

522
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:21,700
Speaker 2:  we need to start treating smartphones as like a fundamentally solved problem

523
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,850
Speaker 2:  that like, this is what they look like. It's fine changing. It would actually

524
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:28,510
Speaker 2:  be more hassle than it's worth, stop having new ideas, just make my battery

525
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,090
Speaker 2:  last longer and keep making everything slightly better. And I'll be happy

526
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:31,870
Speaker 2:  forever.

527
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:35,020
Speaker 4:  No, I think there's a lot to be done to the phone. Right. I still have to

528
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,620
Speaker 4:  put a case on mine less. I drop it and shatter a

529
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:42,520
Speaker 4:  thousand dollar device and have to go get the glass on it replaced.

530
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,610
Speaker 4:  Like that's a problem. I shouldn't have to worry about that. I think it's

531
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:49,240
Speaker 4:  like battery is obviously the biggest thing, but, but the district

532
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,450
Speaker 4:  ability of these things is really, really bad. And given that people are

533
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:56,170
Speaker 4:  holding onto phones longer because they are no longer being as heavily

534
00:31:56,170 --> 00:32:00,070
Speaker 4:  subsidized and they're just like more useful and do all the stuff

535
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:03,910
Speaker 4:  we need. I want it to be able to like last all three years or four

536
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,260
Speaker 4:  years that I use it.

537
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,190
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I think the big challenge for phones is that they actually kind

538
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:12,760
Speaker 5:  of do last a long time. So I might disagree with you, right? Like

539
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,150
Speaker 5:  people hold on to phones for an awful long time. And the idea that that only

540
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:19,150
Speaker 5:  happens because you need a case is like not the worst thing. I think people

541
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:22,870
Speaker 5:  like putting cases on their phones, like if the big next turn in phones is

542
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:25,210
Speaker 5:  you don't need a case. And it'll say the last three years, like, I don't

543
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,670
Speaker 5:  know that we've accomplished. I think people will still put cases on this

544
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:28,360
Speaker 5:  phone.

545
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,900
Speaker 4:  It'll just be me. I'll just be like in the crowd cheering very loudly. Tim's

546
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,590
Speaker 4:  like calmed down.

547
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:36,310
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I think there's a bunch of stuff around how we use phones that

548
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:39,080
Speaker 5:  could change and be meaningfully better.

549
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,590
Speaker 2:  What

550
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:42,290
Speaker 5:  I still think typing on a phone kind of sucks.

551
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:42,920
Speaker 2:  That's a good one.

552
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,850
Speaker 5:  Right? Like it's, it's no fun. I don't want to do it whenever I have to type

553
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:50,630
Speaker 5:  anything long. I start hunting for a real keyboard. It's it's just like

554
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:54,530
Speaker 5:  that. We haven't innovated there in a long time and maybe that's not flashy

555
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:58,400
Speaker 5:  enough for apple to be like, we've invented a way that makes typing on this

556
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,620
Speaker 5:  phone superior or better. It's

557
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,450
Speaker 2:  A revolutionary input device.

558
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:06,170
Speaker 5:  Right. But it's just like, I think there's a lot of the basics that we take

559
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:09,230
Speaker 5:  for granted now were actually a little bit of improvement would go a long

560
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:12,560
Speaker 5:  way and maybe that's it all just comes back to what you're saying, right?

561
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,720
Speaker 5:  Maybe that's on the order of the camera's a little bit better and the battery

562
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,650
Speaker 5:  lasts a little bit longer, but I think we have settled into

563
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:22,370
Speaker 5:  most people know how to use a phone, any radical change in how you use a

564
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:26,030
Speaker 5:  phone will irritate more people than will be excited about

565
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:29,450
Speaker 5:  it. So no more radical changes are coming. And that always just feels

566
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:32,960
Speaker 5:  like it's like that's when things get boring.

567
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,060
Speaker 2:  I don't know though. I like, I I've been thinking about this in the context

568
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,420
Speaker 2:  of Mac books and like laptops in general, because if you rewind, I don't

569
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,640
Speaker 2:  know, eight or nine years, there was this moment where everybody's like,

570
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,150
Speaker 2:  okay, laptops have basically looked and worked the same way for 40

571
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:48,050
Speaker 2:  years. Let's blow it all up. Let's change some things. It's time for new

572
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:51,770
Speaker 2:  ideas about laptops. And we tried, I mean everything. What if your laptop

573
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:54,830
Speaker 2:  detached? What if it looked different? What if it did a spinny thing? What

574
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:57,530
Speaker 2:  if it had three screens? Like we tried all of these ideas and then when it

575
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:01,010
Speaker 2:  turned out, everybody wanted was just a better laptop. And so we've come

576
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:04,970
Speaker 2:  back around to like, this is just what a laptop does. This is how it's

577
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:07,280
Speaker 2:  supposed to work. It doesn't solve all of your problems, but it solves a

578
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,210
Speaker 2:  lot of them. And we should just keep making this thing better in

579
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:15,200
Speaker 2:  ways that are not different. And I'm like, maybe that is just where

580
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,300
Speaker 2:  we've arrived with smartphones. And maybe that says something about like

581
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,780
Speaker 2:  the maturity of the market. But I feel like there's still this itch to like

582
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:24,740
Speaker 2:  have a new idea about smartphones. And part of me is like, maybe,

583
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,860
Speaker 2:  maybe that's not where we should be going with smartphones. Like maybe we've

584
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:31,280
Speaker 2:  had the idea for smart phones and let's just like, keep making them better

585
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,990
Speaker 2:  and then have different ideas about other stuff.

586
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:35,910
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Very few cars get sold with three wheels instead of four, you know?

587
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:39,530
Speaker 5:  No, one's like seven wheels. Like there's some basics that I think are

588
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:40,040
Speaker 5:  locked,

589
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,430
Speaker 4:  But what about like, we're seeing, you know, everybody's got, everybody loves

590
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:47,090
Speaker 4:  old, led a lot of older displays that allows for that flexibility. So we're

591
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:50,600
Speaker 4:  seeing both in watches and in laptops let's play with things.

592
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,410
Speaker 4:  Let's close it, flap it shut. Is that a whole new

593
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:56,150
Speaker 4:  thing or is that just an iteration?

594
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:59,880
Speaker 2:  That's fair. And I will give you, I actually think that like the more I talk

595
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,770
Speaker 2:  to people about the Z flip for the more I'm like, this is the future of phones

596
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:07,130
Speaker 2:  and I want a flip phone forever and ever, and like, maybe that's that's big

597
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:10,700
Speaker 2:  enough. That might count as like a genuine new idea about a phone should

598
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,540
Speaker 2:  work. Except that the thing where Samsung is like put it on an L shape and

599
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:18,230
Speaker 2:  take selfie videos that is bad and not interesting and not a new idea about

600
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,780
Speaker 2:  smart phones. But I think, I, I guess you're right that like on the display

601
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:24,440
Speaker 2:  front, there is probably some interesting stuff left to do,

602
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,380
Speaker 5:  You know, my like general theory about the tech industry is that you can

603
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,530
Speaker 5:  tell what's going to happen. If you just know where displays are going. Like

604
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:34,160
Speaker 5:  if we hadn't invented LCDs, there wouldn't be phones. If you invent folding

605
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,830
Speaker 5:  OLED, someone will come along and like put them to good use. And maybe that

606
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:40,980
Speaker 5:  is a phone that turns into a tablet, or maybe it's a phone that gets smaller

607
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:44,760
Speaker 5:  or maybe it's something else entirely. And we just haven't seen it yet. That's

608
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,450
Speaker 5:  probably the next order of real change. Like obviously Samsung is four

609
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:52,080
Speaker 5:  generations deep into it, but it's still kind of iterative.

610
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,960
Speaker 4:  We're all going to have the like sick fallout cuff

611
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,880
Speaker 5:  To this is my dream. What's my brand

612
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,760
Speaker 5:  cuffs.

613
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,040
Speaker 4:  I guess a little spikes on it. Yes.

614
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,970
Speaker 5:  I'm so down for this, make me a spiky cuff with a rolling

615
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,020
Speaker 5:  Owlette around it.

616
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:10,200
Speaker 2:  You guys can't see this, Neil. I just started throwing money at the screen

617
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,500
Speaker 2:  as he's talking. All right. Let's keep going. So let's do let's do, we're

618
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,160
Speaker 2:  not gonna get to all five, but let's do one more. Each Alex, you went first.

619
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,140
Speaker 2:  So you get to go first. What's what's next on your list.

620
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:23,010
Speaker 4:  So my final question, totally real apple TV. It's this big

621
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:26,550
Speaker 4:  deal that apple wants to bake. They want it to be a TV, like

622
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:30,360
Speaker 4:  service streaming service. They want it to be a box. They want it to be an

623
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,350
Speaker 4:  app on the box and the phone, sometimes the

624
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:38,340
Speaker 4:  Mac book. And it's all the same thing. Like, is it gonna work? Is

625
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:41,400
Speaker 4:  it successful? I think it's like, I watched the

626
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,660
Speaker 4:  shows.

627
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,630
Speaker 2:  Your question is just why apple TV question mark.

628
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,030
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And my question is, why won't you just make me a

629
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:51,990
Speaker 5:  TV? Right? Like the game that apple

630
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:55,950
Speaker 5:  is playing is one where they kind of don't have leverage if

631
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:59,790
Speaker 5:  they put the screen in your house and then Netflix

632
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:03,120
Speaker 5:  wants to be on the screen, then apple can be like, you have to be in our

633
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,360
Speaker 5:  recommendation system. And it's just weird that they haven't made the connection

634
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,420
Speaker 5:  to owning the hardware, gives us control over the software

635
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,730
Speaker 2:  Or the other way to do that, which is the thing Alex and I have talked a

636
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,480
Speaker 2:  ton about is building the best interface, which is like,

637
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,630
Speaker 2:  people are desperate for an app that it just has all the stuff I want to

638
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,030
Speaker 2:  watch and shows me the things I like to watch.

639
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,180
Speaker 5:  Right? But Netflix has an out there, right? You, you make that app and you

640
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,820
Speaker 5:  ship it to Android TVs. And Netflix is like, we're not going to participate

641
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:30,240
Speaker 5:  in your app. You want Netflix drive to survive. Is this other app that we

642
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,720
Speaker 5:  control? If apple has the hardware, they get to say

643
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,260
Speaker 5:  no, like to be on T V O S on our

644
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,770
Speaker 5:  TV, you have to participate in universal search and

645
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:44,550
Speaker 5:  enough people will buy those TVs that Netflix will have to feel the pain

646
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,390
Speaker 5:  and do it.

647
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:49,320
Speaker 4:  Do you think that's true though, because we've seen Netflix play really

648
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,870
Speaker 4:  hard ball. And this situation in the past,

649
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:55,710
Speaker 5:  Netflix is not so much in a position to pay full

650
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,990
Speaker 5:  disclosure. We have made a Netflix show

651
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:01,890
Speaker 5:  disclosure. The disclosure block is here.

652
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:05,010
Speaker 5:  We make a lot of TV. Our company makes a lot of TV shows a lot of companies.

653
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:08,880
Speaker 5:  I'm just saying Netflix, isn't it. This is the time to say, if you

654
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,870
Speaker 5:  want to be on our hardware, which people will buy unlike the car,

655
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:16,830
Speaker 5:  right? If apple makes a TV, it is a guarantee that people will run out

656
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:20,730
Speaker 5:  and buy that TV. They make a call, like, what would I just beg?

657
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:24,560
Speaker 5:  People, send us renders of what you think. An apple mid-sized

658
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,440
Speaker 5:  crossover, the most popular kind of car in America. How

659
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,440
Speaker 5:  does apple make anything that doesn't look like every other bubble on the

660
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,640
Speaker 5:  road today? Right?

661
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,520
Speaker 4:  It's the Homer Simpson car that would have an logo I'm like done

662
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,210
Speaker 4:  sold.

663
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:40,900
Speaker 5:  Right? But you can see how apple would make a great TV. That looks

664
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,990
Speaker 5:  cool. Studio display. Not withstanding. Can you,

665
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:47,500
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It w how do you make a TV that doesn't just look like a

666
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,220
Speaker 2:  TV.

667
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:52,180
Speaker 4:  I got it. I got it. So apple historically has really, really good

668
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,750
Speaker 4:  calibration on their TVs. I'm not saying this will be a selling point for

669
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,530
Speaker 4:  90% of people, but the other 10%, everybody listening to

670
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:03,490
Speaker 4:  this podcast will absolutely go out and buy this. If you were like,

671
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:06,760
Speaker 4:  this is like home theater technician, dude,

672
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,360
Speaker 4:  $500 an hour grade calibration out of the

673
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,140
Speaker 4:  box.

674
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,950
Speaker 2:  So, okay. A thing we have been talking about a bunch on this episode is that

675
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:18,790
Speaker 2:  apple is only interested in large markets and people

676
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:22,420
Speaker 2:  who want to buy the TV, you just described is like 11

677
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,300
Speaker 2:  people.

678
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,110
Speaker 4:  That's just a selling point. That's just a selling point. I think you've

679
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:30,070
Speaker 4:  just say we're doing an apple TV. They got out with the backlights

680
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:34,000
Speaker 4:  get the micro LEDs. They would do

681
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,570
Speaker 4:  to all ed. And you would probably be able to replace the apple TV in the

682
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:41,380
Speaker 4:  back, like would come with the apple TVN you would just pull it out and put

683
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,950
Speaker 4:  a new one in when it's time to upgrade. That's the killer feature.

684
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,330
Speaker 4:  Apple send me my money.

685
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:48,730
Speaker 5:  I just want to point out the people who are making this prediction for like

686
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:52,540
Speaker 5:  20 years straight. I have probably done it. Gene monster built a career on

687
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:56,260
Speaker 5:  this prediction. This is like a real thing. My point is

688
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:00,010
Speaker 5:  unlike the car, which again, I just challenge

689
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:03,280
Speaker 5:  you to be like, what apple has to compete with is

690
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,150
Speaker 5:  midsize crossovers. That is the market. I have to make a Tesla model

691
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:10,870
Speaker 5:  line. That is the market for cars. People like their midsize crossovers.

692
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:14,440
Speaker 5:  They sell lots of them every day. That's hard in software differentiation

693
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,590
Speaker 5:  and cars is not the thing that sells cars. Yeah. TVs are different, right?

694
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:21,460
Speaker 5:  If you apple said, we're making a TV, people would give their money to apple

695
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:25,120
Speaker 5:  tomorrow. Like they just would the same way that when apple says it's making

696
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,270
Speaker 5:  AirPods, people just like buy the AirPods and they assume it'll be good.

697
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:30,970
Speaker 5:  And the software will work. And all the stuff they have the ability to ship

698
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,840
Speaker 5:  a thing that is not at the top of the technology curve, but still be

699
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,770
Speaker 5:  good. Like a 65 inch Ola display is now squarely in

700
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:42,010
Speaker 5:  that sweet spot, right? Where you had just said the standard, LGO a

701
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:45,790
Speaker 5:  display with apple software. Apple's calibration

702
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:49,690
Speaker 5:  runs the thing. And then you can say, a lot of people bought

703
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:53,350
Speaker 5:  these peacock. You want to like participate. We want a cut of all your

704
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,680
Speaker 5:  ads. You want a new video on demand. We want a piece of every transaction.

705
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,040
Speaker 5:  Like that's what Roku does. That's Roku's business. So the argument against

706
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,310
Speaker 5:  the TV right now is people don't buy them often enough. But the actual

707
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:06,910
Speaker 5:  business for Roku, for the fire TV for

708
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:10,150
Speaker 5:  everybody is a cut of the transactions, a service

709
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:13,990
Speaker 5:  business. And that's what Apple's really good at now. And so that's

710
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:17,800
Speaker 5:  again, is that the question is to take, is it just a bald face

711
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,370
Speaker 5:  demand tin build me a TV.

712
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:24,670
Speaker 2:  I have never hoped more that you're right, because I so

713
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:28,360
Speaker 2:  violently disagree with the idea that apple can make a differentiated television

714
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,350
Speaker 2:  that like now I hope we get to prove it out. Like all the things you just

715
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:36,200
Speaker 2:  described, like Bluetooth headphones, mostly suck. Most cell phones

716
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,890
Speaker 2:  are a pain in the ass. Most things are bad when apple

717
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:42,440
Speaker 2:  assaults them, right? Like apple comes in and says, we have made a thing

718
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,340
Speaker 2:  that works better. There is none of that with television that apple has

719
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,760
Speaker 2:  any track record or potential to solve. Like my

720
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,660
Speaker 2:  TV is too large for me to carry around as like

721
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,600
Speaker 2:  not a real problem that exists. My TV is ugly as like not a real problem

722
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,380
Speaker 2:  that exists. My TV software sucks is real. And apple has

723
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,440
Speaker 2:  precisely no track record of doing any better.

724
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,190
Speaker 4:  There's a thing that sucks on TVs that everybody complains about the moment

725
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:10,880
Speaker 4:  they buy, they upgrade their TV. Apple does suck at it though, but

726
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,260
Speaker 4:  really good audio.

727
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:12,900
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

728
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,880
Speaker 4:  Like a thin TV that you can put on the wall and don't need a sound bar. Can't

729
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,450
Speaker 4:  be done. Hasn't been done. If apple was like, we solved that one. I'd be

730
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:24,440
Speaker 4:  like, okay, sure. And two, that would actually be like a compelling

731
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,830
Speaker 4:  thing for a bra. Like that's a problem that people want solved with their

732
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:28,550
Speaker 4:  TVs.

733
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,890
Speaker 5:  Five home pods, the apple TV

734
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:32,600
Speaker 5:  strategy.

735
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,370
Speaker 4:  We'll ship you five home pods for

736
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:36,930
Speaker 4:  free.

737
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:40,910
Speaker 5:  You could see like that's a, that's a hardware design challenge. That apple

738
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:44,870
Speaker 5:  is up to the task of doing right integrate speakers

739
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:48,110
Speaker 5:  around the TV that do all the bouncy stuff. Like they love spatial

740
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:52,040
Speaker 5:  audio. Apple wants nothing more than for the cast of Bridger tend to be

741
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,880
Speaker 5:  sneaking up behind you. It's true. They

742
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,390
Speaker 5:  could do it. They have to actually do it. And I think, I think they get trapped

743
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:03,230
Speaker 5:  in, we need a market. That's big enough to be worth it. So we're going to

744
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:07,130
Speaker 5:  chase healthcare and cars instead of what is a thing people have in their

745
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:10,610
Speaker 5:  house that could be substantially better. That then turns into

746
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:14,390
Speaker 5:  transactions over time. That turn into a big market like apple of all companies

747
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:17,330
Speaker 5:  right now, apple could do the thing where they rescue

748
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:20,840
Speaker 5:  theatrical, right by saying, you're actually going to a movie theater. You're

749
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,840
Speaker 5:  going to buy the movie on iTunes for a hundred dollars. And it's going to

750
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,800
Speaker 5:  stream once on your beautiful TV. Apple has the clout to do it

751
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,730
Speaker 5:  right there. Our studio, like you have to invent this stuff that is risky

752
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:35,510
Speaker 5:  and say, it will turn into a market. Instead of saying, here's a market.

753
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:38,120
Speaker 5:  You understand what the big number that has a T at the end of it. And we're

754
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,550
Speaker 5:  going to go take that one with no track record.

755
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:43,150
Speaker 2:  All right, Neil, what's your next one? And this can't be about the TV.

756
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:45,650
Speaker 5:  This actually relates to kind of our privacy conversation. And it's more

757
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:48,830
Speaker 5:  of what will they build right there in this privacy conversation. We know

758
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:51,530
Speaker 5:  they take a lot of money from Google every year to be the default search

759
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:54,860
Speaker 5:  engine in the iPhone. We know their privacy stance puts them in conflict.

760
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:58,400
Speaker 5:  With that moment. We know there's an advertising business. Are they just

761
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,090
Speaker 5:  going to build a search engine? It's the thing that they can take the most

762
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:05,870
Speaker 5:  easily by saying goodbye to Google's money and making their own search

763
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:09,320
Speaker 5:  engine, that a fault on the iPhone, they will instantly have massive share

764
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,750
Speaker 5:  in search, which they can do all kinds of things with

765
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:14,870
Speaker 4:  Don't. They kind of suck at algorithms. Like I never think of apple as a

766
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:18,770
Speaker 4:  really powerful player in the algorithm space, given

767
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:22,700
Speaker 4:  how often they, who will not be named activates on

768
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:26,100
Speaker 4:  my wrist every day. And it answers my questions poorly.

769
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,730
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I don't, I mean, apple can be good at whatever it wants the richest

770
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:31,290
Speaker 5:  company in the world. They can, they can be good at whatever they want. I

771
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:34,260
Speaker 2:  Think. Yes and no, I think would is the answer to your question. Cause I

772
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:38,190
Speaker 2:  think like spotlight is pretty clearly what apple perceives to be

773
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:40,950
Speaker 2:  a search engine, right? Like it, it searches the stuff on your computer,

774
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:44,370
Speaker 2:  but also like it does, it does web image search going forward and that's

775
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:48,360
Speaker 2:  like, you can search for images in spotlight is that it's like not

776
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,210
Speaker 2:  quite a search engine, but it's like kind of a search engine. And I think

777
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:55,110
Speaker 2:  what apple seems like it's going to do is start to try to like abstract

778
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:58,530
Speaker 2:  more stuff away. Like, I don't know that building the sort of general

779
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:02,460
Speaker 2:  informational Google search thing is all that interesting to apple, but

780
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:06,450
Speaker 2:  in the sense of like, can apple build an all in one travel

781
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:10,410
Speaker 2:  product and like, can apple take shopping, share away and start to

782
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:14,040
Speaker 2:  like pull some of that stuff into its other products? I think.

783
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,620
Speaker 2:  Absolutely. And it's like pretty clear that that's what apple is going to

784
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:20,430
Speaker 2:  do. So I think like is apple going to buy, I don't know, some small

785
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:23,850
Speaker 2:  search engine or like try to roll its own from scratch. Maybe it certainly

786
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:27,450
Speaker 2:  could, but I, my guess would be, it tries to just like pull a search engine

787
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:31,020
Speaker 2:  into like its component parts and then just like eat them one at a time.

788
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,700
Speaker 5:  But at some point you have to build web search

789
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,970
Speaker 2:  Maybe, but also like that's fairly commoditized, right? You just like buy

790
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:39,630
Speaker 2:  the Bing search index, put your stuff on top of it. And like

791
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:43,140
Speaker 2:  people searching, like who was this 16th president of United States? It's

792
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,450
Speaker 2:  like, that's a solved problem. Right? Like you don't need to go reinvent

793
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:46,380
Speaker 2:  the wheel to do that.

794
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:50,250
Speaker 4:  Oh, I disagree. I think you have to really? Yeah. The

795
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:54,090
Speaker 4:  reason everybody makes fun of being is because it doesn't always serve what

796
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:57,990
Speaker 4:  you actually want. And Google has obviously gotten really

797
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:01,290
Speaker 4:  far field is a lot harder to find what you want on Google. Nowadays, it takes

798
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:04,800
Speaker 4:  more work if you're not just looking for the most obvious questions on the

799
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,130
Speaker 4:  planet. And even sometimes then it takes a while. That's the

800
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:11,850
Speaker 4:  problem that that's happened is like Google is so invested in selling you

801
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:15,720
Speaker 4:  stuff. Being is so invested in like, not doing

802
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:19,710
Speaker 4:  what I need it to do and giving me points and all sorts

803
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:23,610
Speaker 4:  of other junk. Like I need the thing that just takes me where I want to go.

804
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:27,510
Speaker 4:  And I don't know if Apple's necessarily capable of doing it. Like nobody's

805
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:31,290
Speaker 4:  really good at it. Duck, duck go is pretty close. Obviously Google, if you

806
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:34,980
Speaker 4:  like add a bunch of like little negative signs and say don't

807
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:38,340
Speaker 4:  include Pinterest, don't include weird forums from the

808
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:42,330
Speaker 4:  1990s. Like very helpful, but I don't know if apple can do

809
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:46,110
Speaker 4:  that. I just, yeah, I, I, I would love it. I would love a really

810
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:49,710
Speaker 4:  strong search engine, but search engines can't be like

811
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:53,640
Speaker 4:  hand coded. Like you can't just like have somebody pick it

812
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,570
Speaker 4:  all and make that a super strong, powerful search engine. That's why Google

813
00:46:57,570 --> 00:46:58,410
Speaker 4:  is successful.

814
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:01,560
Speaker 2:  They try to do it like apple music, like hand curate the internet for you

815
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:01,920
Speaker 2:  every day,

816
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,400
Speaker 5:  Jimmy Eileen will personally return your search results to,

817
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,210
Speaker 4:  And I think that that was like a thing, but we can't do that. Like that's

818
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:11,640
Speaker 4:  effectively what a lot of websites do, right? Like that's what the verge

819
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,120
Speaker 4:  does. Like a lot of us are about that curation, but that curation at

820
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:18,750
Speaker 4:  scale, have we seen it done successfully? No.

821
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:22,500
Speaker 5:  Yeah, but can apple keep its privacy branding

822
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:26,430
Speaker 5:  when they accept a ton of money from Google to give your search data

823
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:29,710
Speaker 5:  to them, that's literally what, like next to your physical

824
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:33,310
Speaker 5:  location, all the things you search for is a pretty

825
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:37,240
Speaker 5:  enormous Corpus of information about you. And they basically sell it to

826
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,660
Speaker 5:  Google for iPhone users, right? Even if you switch it to being, they're still

827
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:44,650
Speaker 5:  selling it to Microsoft, like they're giving it away in some massive

828
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:48,070
Speaker 5:  meaningful way. And you kinda know that you're searching Google. So

829
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:52,030
Speaker 5:  like it's not as shady is making it out to be here, but it's still

830
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:55,960
Speaker 5:  like, you're the privacy company and you're not protecting this thing as

831
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,360
Speaker 5:  hard as you could by building your own product that actually respects it

832
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:01,750
Speaker 5:  more than Google does. I don't know. Like I think there's, there's a point

833
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:05,590
Speaker 5:  at which that decision around spotlight gets fraught because you have to,

834
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:08,710
Speaker 5:  apple has to give up the money and the money is important for a lot of reasons.

835
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:12,190
Speaker 5:  One it's money, but two, it like, you know, Google wants that position. So

836
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:15,940
Speaker 5:  they want to be in a place where Apple's good to them for all

837
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:18,940
Speaker 5:  kinds of reasons. They want the YouTube app on your phone, but it also just

838
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:21,700
Speaker 5:  like cuts both ways. Like it's the, to me, whenever we talk about apple and

839
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,150
Speaker 5:  privacy and the complexity of it, the, you take a bunch of money from

840
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:29,020
Speaker 5:  Google and then slap Google around. It's like weird.

841
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:31,240
Speaker 5:  Yes. Right? It's like the first counter-argue

842
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,570
Speaker 2:  No, I agree. I think that's right. And I think apple has spent a long time

843
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:38,200
Speaker 2:  hiding behind like people like Google search. So we're going, it's fine.

844
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,650
Speaker 2:  And I don't know how much longer that works. All right. We're going to take

845
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:44,950
Speaker 2:  a break and then we're going to come back and talk about all of our overheated

846
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:48,520
Speaker 2:  most spicy, not even sure. We totally believe them takes about

847
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,330
Speaker 2:  apple. We'll be right

848
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:55,780
Speaker 2:  back.

849
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:03,850
Speaker 9:  You listened to this show weekend and week out because, well, we'd like to

850
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:07,450
Speaker 9:  think we offer sharp unfiltered insights into the biggest stories in tech

851
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:09,310
Speaker 9:  business and politics.

852
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:25,770
Speaker 2:  Okay. We're back. I'm just bursting with hot takes here. So let's, let's

853
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:28,320
Speaker 2:  move on and run through some of those quick before we go, I'm going to go

854
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,170
Speaker 2:  first. Cause it's my turn. This actually I think jives with a lot of the

855
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:33,780
Speaker 2:  stuff we've been talking about, but the first one I wrote down is apple is

856
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:37,710
Speaker 2:  too popular and it's killing apple. Yeah. Back in the day when

857
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:41,430
Speaker 2:  apple was like this high-end thing for people who appreciated

858
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:44,190
Speaker 2:  beautiful hardware, apple could sort of do whatever it wanted because it

859
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:46,830
Speaker 2:  had this like built-in group of people who cared about this stuff and were

860
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:50,100
Speaker 2:  interested in, played along. And now when you're in a world where everybody

861
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:53,640
Speaker 2:  uses an iPhone and everybody uses an iPad and Macs are

862
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:57,330
Speaker 2:  massively popular, you end up in this world where apple can't get

863
00:51:57,330 --> 00:52:00,990
Speaker 2:  rid of one of its multitasking options on a Mac, because there's

864
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:04,830
Speaker 2:  a small, but statistically relevant people, number of people who use

865
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:08,790
Speaker 2:  it. And so they have a million ways to do everything. And like

866
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:12,600
Speaker 2:  Macko S is turning into windows because as long as some people use

867
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,990
Speaker 2:  something, apple can't kill it. And apple is, is too big. And it's making

868
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:17,880
Speaker 2:  apple not able to do anything.

869
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:21,510
Speaker 5:  It's not even windows, correct comparisons, Microsoft word, like the

870
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:25,410
Speaker 5:  Microsoft word team will tell you this every day,

871
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:29,040
Speaker 5:  if you ask them that the reason the menu bar is cluttered is because every

872
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,970
Speaker 5:  button is 10 million people that use it. You can't clean it up because

873
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:36,240
Speaker 5:  some massive amount of the population that isn't, you cares about it and

874
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:40,140
Speaker 5:  you don't. And I think that is true. I would actually put the apple is too

875
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:43,950
Speaker 5:  popular and it's killing them in a different way, which is they're so

876
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:47,910
Speaker 5:  popular. They often don't feel real competition. So they just can

877
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:51,690
Speaker 5:  do everything. And like their hardware teams still need the things to be

878
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:54,390
Speaker 5:  more beautiful than the next thing on the shelf. And they care a lot and

879
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:56,640
Speaker 5:  you can see the hardware's gotten better. They've added the ports back, right?

880
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,000
Speaker 5:  Like very simple things that everyone can see and they can feel the pressure,

881
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,930
Speaker 5:  their software teams are more insulated than ever. And

882
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:07,590
Speaker 5:  I think you can see it in a software design. It doesn't matter if apple

883
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:10,930
Speaker 5:  software is 10% easier to use anymore. Like what are you going to do?

884
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:14,880
Speaker 5:  Switch? And I think that attitude has permeated a lot of

885
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:15,420
Speaker 5:  what they do.

886
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:19,080
Speaker 2:  What are you going to do? Switch is like, definitely written in large letters

887
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:22,290
Speaker 2:  on us, on a wall, somewhere in apple. And they'll just like tap it as they

888
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:26,100
Speaker 2:  walk in every morning. Okay. Nila, what's your, what's your first

889
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:26,850
Speaker 2:  hottest take

890
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:28,080
Speaker 5:  My overheated take.

891
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:31,440
Speaker 2:  We should say again, these, these are not things that we definitely for sure.

892
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,140
Speaker 2:  Believe. They're just things that exist inside of our souls that we need

893
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:35,790
Speaker 2:  to get out on microphone.

894
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:39,780
Speaker 5:  I think actually apple, this is overheated. I don't know if I believe

895
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:43,140
Speaker 5:  this at all. Apple's complacency in like

896
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:46,920
Speaker 5:  software will be the thing that, that hurts them and we'd see. End of

897
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,910
Speaker 5:  apple. It's maybe true. Maybe not. But I think a lot of developers

898
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:54,660
Speaker 5:  are angry at apple. I think apple to recruit people, they have to

899
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:57,810
Speaker 5:  buy into Apple's way of doing things, which means if you are

900
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:01,620
Speaker 5:  young and you want a job at apple, like maybe you're not allowed to invent

901
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:04,920
Speaker 5:  as much stuff as you would be somewhere else. Maybe the iPhone interface

902
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,610
Speaker 5:  isn't up for grabs. And I think fundamentally like, unless they get more

903
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:12,150
Speaker 5:  aggressive, like, like all giant companies, like all went up, like what's

904
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:15,570
Speaker 5:  the best argument against antitrust action. It's at large companies inevitably

905
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:19,230
Speaker 5:  fall apart in their own. Right. And I think apple, like I see the

906
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:23,040
Speaker 5:  software. It's not just me. It's like John Gruber will tell you apple

907
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,970
Speaker 5:  software is like pretty messy lately. The hardware is beautiful. It's

908
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:30,540
Speaker 5:  some of the best they've ever done. The software is like weirdly messy. My

909
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:33,720
Speaker 5:  overheated take is it's the software that brings them down more than any

910
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:37,320
Speaker 5:  outing government, regulator or anything else. It's not having the focus

911
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:37,800
Speaker 5:  there.

912
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,280
Speaker 2:  I buy that honestly. And I think I was talking to the

913
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,150
Speaker 2:  folks at Dashlane, the password manager about pass keys and

914
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:49,080
Speaker 2:  this like passwordless future that we're all heading into. And I asked

915
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,050
Speaker 2:  them about mobile. And they said in this very diplomatic way that, you know,

916
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:55,290
Speaker 2:  desktop is one thing because of the standards are much more open and on mobile,

917
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:59,130
Speaker 2:  apple and Google really controlled their ecosystems and apple in particular

918
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:02,910
Speaker 2:  is on very much this like annual cadence of software releases.

919
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:06,390
Speaker 2:  And because of that, we're probably not going to get any of the tools. We

920
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:09,420
Speaker 2:  need to do some of this interesting stuff on mobile for at least a year,

921
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:12,000
Speaker 2:  because that's just what apple does. They just don't release the new stuff

922
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,720
Speaker 2:  for 12 months. And like, it just got me thinking that it's like it, this

923
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:19,650
Speaker 2:  is the new equivalent of like Microsoft shipping windows in a box every five

924
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:23,010
Speaker 2:  years that it's like, the world just moves faster than this now.

925
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:26,760
Speaker 2:  And not only is apple not, you know, necessarily

926
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,630
Speaker 2:  known for its thrilling software anymore. It's just behind.

927
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:34,020
Speaker 2:  And it's like a running joke that Android is way ahead. And eventually it

928
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:37,260
Speaker 2:  doesn't seem crazy to me that that would catch up to apple in a bigger way.

929
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:40,560
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean, that take is really overheated, right? Then eventually Andrew,

930
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:43,500
Speaker 5:  it will become so superior to apple that people will have. What are you going

931
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:47,310
Speaker 5:  to switch? But over the longterm,

932
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:51,250
Speaker 5:  does Apple's lack of discipline in its software design catch up to, I

933
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:52,620
Speaker 5:  think, I think absolutely. Yes.

934
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:53,940
Speaker 2:  I like it. Alex got

935
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:57,450
Speaker 4:  My hot take is wireless as bad. Like Apple's kind of

936
00:55:57,450 --> 00:55:59,670
Speaker 4:  obsession with wireless is bad.

937
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:00,030
Speaker 5:  More

938
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:01,110
Speaker 2:  Wires.

939
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:04,170
Speaker 5:  No, actually I can back this up, Alex, I have a stat for you.

940
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:04,530
Speaker 4:  Happy with

941
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:08,280
Speaker 5:  It. You know how apple is like they showed CarPlay WWDC and I was a big

942
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:12,270
Speaker 5:  Panther and in a car and they're basically their response to every car

943
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:15,930
Speaker 5:  maker being like no right Apple's responses. People won't buy a car. That

944
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:19,680
Speaker 5:  car play. Yeah. That's, that's what they're banking on. Turns out

945
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,260
Speaker 5:  that since CarPlay went wireless, consumer happiness,

946
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:27,250
Speaker 5:  consumer satisfaction with CarPlay it's plummeted because it's not as

947
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,410
Speaker 5:  consistent as plugging your phone in

948
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:29,530
Speaker 4:  The

949
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:33,370
Speaker 5:  Cation. It's as direct as it gets. It's a little slower, a little

950
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:37,030
Speaker 5:  flakier sometimes it doesn't connect. Sometimes. I dunno. It's it's a

951
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:40,540
Speaker 5:  wireless CarPlay is a weird combo platter of Bluetooth and wifi, right?

952
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:44,260
Speaker 5:  Like it pairs it phone over Bluetooth. It says I can do wireless CarPlay.

953
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:47,260
Speaker 5:  It switches the connection to wifi. Cause it's got a mirror, the screen,

954
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:50,380
Speaker 5:  all this stuff. Right. It turns out that it's just a lot of wireless radios

955
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:53,440
Speaker 5:  in the mix. And your phone acts weird when you do it. And people are like,

956
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,180
Speaker 5:  I don't like this as much as plugging my phone in.

957
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:58,720
Speaker 4:  Exactly. Yeah. I think that's the point is like you see with that, you see

958
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,230
Speaker 4:  with Bluetooth headphones, like apple has the best ones. They still suck.

959
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:05,860
Speaker 4:  At least a fifth of the time. I wear them every day and at least

960
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:09,460
Speaker 4:  once a week, something happens. So at least a seventh of the time,

961
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:12,910
Speaker 4:  sorry, I was getting wrong with my, my stats there, but there there's that

962
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:16,630
Speaker 4:  lack of consistency. And at this point we have like wires are

963
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:20,200
Speaker 4:  consistent and a lot of spaces, wires, willpower, your phone faster,

964
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,770
Speaker 4:  still wires will connect your phone to your car more

965
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:27,730
Speaker 4:  consistently and your headphones. And it's just like, people care about that

966
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:31,540
Speaker 4:  consistency. So maybe care about like

967
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:31,990
Speaker 4:  that.

968
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:35,710
Speaker 5:  Yes. The most overheated take at the verge is that wired

969
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:39,550
Speaker 5:  connections are faster and more reliable than wireless ones. There's a

970
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:41,500
Speaker 5:  hill we're going to die on it's that fact.

971
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,930
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I don't know that that's an overheated take. That's just true.

972
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:47,200
Speaker 5:  I know people get mad at me all the time. Like when I did the Starlink review,

973
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,200
Speaker 5:  I was like, okay, well your house is better. People like you're in the pocket

974
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,650
Speaker 5:  of Comcast. So I was like, no, I'm just saying her connections are fast and

975
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:56,080
Speaker 5:  reliable.

976
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:59,500
Speaker 2:  We just forget the part where it's, you know, wired connections are faster

977
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:02,110
Speaker 2:  and more reliable parentheses. And it turns out nobody really

978
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:05,950
Speaker 2:  cares. It's like, which

979
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:09,760
Speaker 2:  is, it's just, this is where we live now. Okay. My second overheated

980
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:13,360
Speaker 2:  take and I like every day, this becomes less overheated and more just how

981
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:16,060
Speaker 2:  I feel. But I can't believe I'm starting to feel this way, which is that

982
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:19,780
Speaker 2:  I think the apple TV might be the best set top box on the market. Yes. I

983
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:23,620
Speaker 2:  have spent a long time, like a long time talking shit

984
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:27,610
Speaker 2:  about the apple TV because it was bad and expensive and apple should

985
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:31,390
Speaker 2:  feel bad about itself. And then I bought two Roku TVs that over the

986
00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:35,350
Speaker 2:  course of the roughly 12 months that I have owned them seem to get slower

987
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:39,220
Speaker 2:  and worse every single day. And then I turn on like

988
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:42,610
Speaker 2:  my fire TVs, which seems to get slower and worse every single day. And then

989
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:46,600
Speaker 2:  I opened up the apple TV, which is like too big and too expensive. And the

990
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:50,440
Speaker 2:  Siri remote is still stupid, but like, boy, it's fast. And it just like,

991
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:54,340
Speaker 2:  it opens the apps when it's supposed to open the apps. And I'm like,

992
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:58,330
Speaker 2:  I ha I just, I feel like a bad person that I'm like, I'm going

993
00:58:58,330 --> 00:58:59,740
Speaker 2:  to use the apple TV now.

994
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:01,900
Speaker 5:  But you feel like a bad person. I

995
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:05,710
Speaker 2:  Have talked so much shit about the apple TV. Like I cannot tell you

996
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:09,550
Speaker 4:  No, it's it's like home theater makers are not home theater makers, but home

997
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:12,820
Speaker 4:  theater like designers and the guys who set them up and everything, they

998
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:16,600
Speaker 4:  actually prefer the apple TV. Like that's the set top box that they go

999
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:20,080
Speaker 4:  to because it does have like, it's really good at doing most of the outputs

1000
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:23,840
Speaker 4:  and it's fast. And it pairs with a bunch of their super expensive crap

1001
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:27,800
Speaker 4:  that none of us will be able to afford. But it's really neat, you know, fireplaces

1002
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,640
Speaker 4:  that come on and I'm sure like coordinate with whatever you're watching on

1003
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:35,630
Speaker 4:  house of dragons that week. Yeah. It's a good box. I have got

1004
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:38,420
Speaker 4:  two, I've got one in my bedroom. I never turned the TV on in my bedroom,

1005
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:41,300
Speaker 4:  but if I do six months down the line, I don't have to be like, okay, I have

1006
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:44,780
Speaker 4:  to find all my logins again. Okay. I have to update the app so I can watch

1007
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:48,560
Speaker 4:  Netflix. Like it just does it. The things are there, it

1008
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:52,370
Speaker 4:  works. And like the worst thing in the world is if you're like, boom, nobody's

1009
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:55,070
Speaker 4:  here at the house tonight. I'm going to like sit down in front of the TV

1010
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:58,580
Speaker 4:  and eat this dinner and watch a show. And then you sit down and you turn

1011
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:02,390
Speaker 4:  on the TV and the set top box sucks. Like the things aren't

1012
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,360
Speaker 4:  loading. And I don't have that issue with apple. As often,

1013
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:09,320
Speaker 5:  We very much tried to be a Chromecast for the Google TV family for a

1014
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:13,100
Speaker 5:  variety of reasons. Most of which is letting the kid just yell at

1015
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:17,060
Speaker 5:  the Google home to turn on the show is like really good.

1016
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:20,030
Speaker 5:  And the thing is just, they just promised to update it to make it fast. And

1017
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:22,670
Speaker 5:  it's like, there's a part of me that believes that the reason the apple TV

1018
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:26,660
Speaker 5:  is successful is because it just gets a draft on the operating system

1019
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:30,410
Speaker 5:  work that apple does for its real computers. And no one else has to do that

1020
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:34,100
Speaker 5:  work. So like, yeah, Roku runs an O S or the world's best

1021
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:37,460
Speaker 5:  operating system engineers working at Roku to do memory

1022
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:38,720
Speaker 5:  management.

1023
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:42,500
Speaker 2:  Well, it also, all those companies are now on this like crazy downward

1024
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:45,860
Speaker 2:  spiral. Like Roku's job is to basically figure out how to sell you a set

1025
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:49,340
Speaker 2:  top box for $1. Like that seems to be Roku's job. They either want to put

1026
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:53,060
Speaker 2:  it into television or just make it like a free thing that they hand out at

1027
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:56,060
Speaker 2:  fairs. Right? Like that's what, that's what Roku wants to be. And I'm just

1028
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:59,000
Speaker 2:  like, what if you made a good one? Like, that's, that's an idea. Like what

1029
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,550
Speaker 2:  if, what if you made a set top box? That was good.

1030
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:04,940
Speaker 5:  Amazon makes really high powered boxes. Right? I mean, at every, at every

1031
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:08,720
Speaker 5:  price went from nothing to a couple like 150 bucks maybe.

1032
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,620
Speaker 4:  And have you ever used, like, it's ugly, like Amazon does not put

1033
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:16,460
Speaker 4:  it's like, I don't think there's one UI designer in

1034
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:20,420
Speaker 4:  all of Amazon and they have to work on every single project. That's the only

1035
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:24,170
Speaker 4:  explanation for how bad across the board Amazon UIs are.

1036
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:28,040
Speaker 5:  They just redid it all. It's not like great. You know, it's, it's not, it

1037
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,740
Speaker 5:  looks like everything else. But I do think

1038
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:34,580
Speaker 5:  fundamentally Apple's scale gives them a

1039
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:38,180
Speaker 5:  huge advantage with the hardware of the TV box. Again, I think the software

1040
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:42,170
Speaker 5:  is pretty messy, but yeah, the thing's a little iPad. It gets all of

1041
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:45,920
Speaker 5:  the benefits of the iPad, like engineering team. It gets all the benefits

1042
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,790
Speaker 5:  of the, the M one engineering team. It gets all the benefits of the iPhone

1043
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:53,570
Speaker 5:  engineering team to just operate as a computer. So it's a really good

1044
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:57,260
Speaker 5:  computer and it doesn't kill its own memory and require a

1045
01:01:57,260 --> 01:02:00,770
Speaker 5:  restart every two days. Like that's weird. That's just a weird thing. My

1046
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:02,870
Speaker 5:  Google TV requires. Yup.

1047
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:04,190
Speaker 2:  Alex would he got,

1048
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:08,000
Speaker 4:  I think it isn't the most important product hardware product at

1049
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,900
Speaker 4:  apple is the Mac book or like the, like the computer,

1050
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:12,770
Speaker 4:  not the phone.

1051
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:14,480
Speaker 5:  Oh, that's really overheated.

1052
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,990
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Coming in hot. No, because we saw

1053
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:21,210
Speaker 4:  during the pandemic that people actually do care about their

1054
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:24,780
Speaker 4:  computers that we all have. Like we're very quietly caring about our

1055
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:28,470
Speaker 4:  computers and then we all had to go buy them. And I think like

1056
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:31,950
Speaker 4:  computers are still the core of the heart of things everybody's using phones,

1057
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:35,730
Speaker 4:  but Quimby thought that phones were going to be a great deal. How'd that

1058
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:38,880
Speaker 4:  go for you? Watching entertainment people don't actually like watching movies

1059
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,510
Speaker 4:  on their phones. If they don't have to, they, they would prefer a computer.

1060
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:46,320
Speaker 4:  They don't like having to type out their school

1061
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:50,070
Speaker 4:  book reports. I'm thinking of the kids here, like computers

1062
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:54,060
Speaker 4:  still do a good task and they do it really, really well. And phones

1063
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:57,360
Speaker 4:  are really, really important. They're critical. We all use them every day,

1064
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:00,600
Speaker 4:  but you go to your computer a lot and that's their core

1065
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:03,480
Speaker 4:  business. And from which everything else Springs,

1066
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,750
Speaker 2:  I would quibble with the idea that it's their core business at this point.

1067
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:09,810
Speaker 4:  It should be their core business. There we go.

1068
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:13,770
Speaker 2:  I do think, I mean, one of my alternate overheated takes was going

1069
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:17,010
Speaker 2:  to be that Apple's Silicon investment is actually going to be the legacy

1070
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:19,500
Speaker 2:  of apple and might turn out to be the most important thing you've ever spent

1071
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,960
Speaker 2:  its money on. And I think that sort of drives at this point too, right? Is

1072
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:25,290
Speaker 2:  that like, at least for a while longer, our

1073
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:28,560
Speaker 2:  computers are like a central device in our lives and this doesn't apply to

1074
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:31,440
Speaker 2:  everybody. It doesn't apply everywhere in the world, but like the centrality

1075
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,400
Speaker 2:  of the PC is as obvious as it ever was to a lot of people right now, I

1076
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,360
Speaker 2:  think. And I think in that sense, apple like seems to have fashioned

1077
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:42,300
Speaker 2:  itself as a computer company again for the first time in awhile, which I

1078
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:43,680
Speaker 2:  think is kind of exciting

1079
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:47,160
Speaker 4:  And they're changing everybody else. Like everybody's now chasing them to

1080
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:51,060
Speaker 4:  some degree. Intel like went from fi it's wild to me that five

1081
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:54,660
Speaker 4:  years ago, Intel was so big. It could not fail it.

1082
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:58,160
Speaker 4:  Like had this huge monopoly like net, what was it? 95,

1083
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:01,710
Speaker 4:  90 9% of, of like computers and

1084
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:05,520
Speaker 4:  servers were, were them. And it's just collapsed

1085
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:09,150
Speaker 4:  because apple and AMD came along and apple in particular is forcing

1086
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:12,960
Speaker 4:  everybody to rethink how they design these things and rethink how

1087
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,620
Speaker 4:  operating systems work. And that's awesome. And it's

1088
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:19,080
Speaker 4:  because of the Mac book, I'm bringing it all back.

1089
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,920
Speaker 5:  I here's how it's definitely overheated. Like apple

1090
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:25,470
Speaker 5:  could shut down the Mac line and still be as big as apple.

1091
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:29,010
Speaker 2:  Listen to me, like we're not here for reality for things.

1092
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:32,940
Speaker 5:  No, but I, I agree that the feeling is important. Like a reason

1093
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:36,840
Speaker 5:  that I will not buy a windows computer is because I can't text from it as

1094
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:40,500
Speaker 5:  reliably as I can from my Mac book. And that's a really important

1095
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:43,860
Speaker 5:  feature to me. Cause I spend actually more time now in my

1096
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:47,370
Speaker 5:  laptop than I do on my phone. I don't even know that's true. It just feels

1097
01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:51,210
Speaker 5:  that way. Right? Like while we've been doing this, literally using my

1098
01:04:51,210 --> 01:04:54,510
Speaker 5:  laptop, I've picked up my phone three times. That's

1099
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:57,450
Speaker 5:  ridiculous.

1100
01:04:57,450 --> 01:05:00,030
Speaker 2:  Glad to know we're keeping your attention. You know, I thank you for being

1101
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:00,810
Speaker 2:  present. Awesome.

1102
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:03,390
Speaker 5:  I don't know what this TV take is. David's mad at himself, again. What's

1103
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:06,750
Speaker 5:  going on on Twitter. But I think fundamentally it's where you're

1104
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:09,660
Speaker 5:  productive. And I think Apple's argument for a long time is you will soon

1105
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:12,540
Speaker 5:  be productive on your iPad. You'll assume to be as productive on your phone.

1106
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:16,530
Speaker 5:  And certainly people are productive and iPads and phones, but like most businesses

1107
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:20,290
Speaker 5:  are run on Excel and Excel happens on your laptop. And that's

1108
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:23,050
Speaker 5:  like, that reality is not going anywhere for anyone.

1109
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:24,700
Speaker 2:  I like it. All right. And you know, you get to go last, then we're going

1110
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,620
Speaker 2:  to get out of here. What's your last overheat to take.

1111
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:28,780
Speaker 5:  Apple will not reach its final form until it builds a

1112
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:32,350
Speaker 5:  TV.

1113
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:35,380
Speaker 2:  I feel like I should've seen that coming. I regret

1114
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:38,800
Speaker 5:  Apple is not a successful company. It cannot be counted as a

1115
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:42,760
Speaker 5:  success until it builds a TV until it takes over the single device in our

1116
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:46,510
Speaker 5:  lives. That is responsible for America's cultural hush

1117
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:48,520
Speaker 5:  money.

1118
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:50,500
Speaker 2:  All right, well, we're done.

1119
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:51,280
Speaker 5:  We had a good ride and it's

1120
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,790
Speaker 2:  True this far, the last episode ever with the

1121
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:58,360
Speaker 2:  Vergecast. This is, this turns into the Neal. I spends an hour begging apple

1122
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,680
Speaker 2:  to make a TV. Every week

1123
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:03,520
Speaker 5:  We got to do it. Why don't we do it here, man? There's millions of people

1124
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:07,330
Speaker 5:  out there running ties in, in their living rooms. What are

1125
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:08,230
Speaker 5:  you doing?

1126
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:10,270
Speaker 2:  So you're saying apple has like a moral obligation

1127
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:10,820
Speaker 5:  Moral.

1128
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:13,810
Speaker 2:  It's not just a business thing. It's like, like what Tim cook says about

1129
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:14,870
Speaker 2:  like saving lives.

1130
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:18,760
Speaker 5:  You want to be the privacy company. Do you know what the single most like

1131
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:22,360
Speaker 5:  intrusive wackadoo privacy like

1132
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:25,810
Speaker 5:  destructing device in your home is your television.

1133
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:26,650
Speaker 2:  You're not wrong.

1134
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:29,740
Speaker 4:  An apple TV with built in ad

1135
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:32,530
Speaker 4:  blockers.

1136
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:36,490
Speaker 5:  I think that might kill my model by services model,

1137
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:40,240
Speaker 5:  but like it knows everything you're watching. Most of the TVs have

1138
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,030
Speaker 5:  automatic content detection that can tell what games you're playing on your

1139
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:46,600
Speaker 5:  console. It's like the amount of data that your TVs

1140
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:50,560
Speaker 5:  collect and send out to data brokers is out of control. So

1141
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:53,150
Speaker 5:  if they do have a moral obligations, it's sitting right there.

1142
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:54,640
Speaker 2:  There you go. You heard it here. First

1143
