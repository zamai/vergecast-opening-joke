Description: For the last eight months, David Cogen has been living a double life. By day: a YouTuber and creator, the face of the TheUnlockr channel, reviewing phones and testing ebikes and explaining how food smokers really work. By night and morning and every single other available in-between moment: a coffee shop entrepreneur, working to get a Brooklyn spot called Coffee Check up and running. In this episode, the second in the two-part miniseries that we’re calling How To Make It In The Future, Cogen tells the story of how a YouTuber becomes a coffee shop owner — and how to bring those two things together without ruining them both.

00:00:03,185 --> 00:00:06,755
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Robot Baristas.

3
00:00:07,055 --> 00:00:10,995
Speaker 2:  I'm your friend, David Pierce, and I am sitting here doing cold brew research.

4
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:15,275
Speaker 2:  So about a year ago, I started making overnight oats a lot. I really like

5
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:18,235
Speaker 2:  the idea of being able to right before I go to bed, basically make my breakfast

6
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:21,275
Speaker 2:  ticket in the fridge, and then it's ready for me when I get up in the morning.

7
00:00:21,465 --> 00:00:25,315
Speaker 2:  It's really helpful having a kid around in the house who also needs breakfast

8
00:00:25,315 --> 00:00:29,195
Speaker 2:  and likes to just run in circles, starting at 5:00 AM But it also just

9
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,835
Speaker 2:  feels nice. It's like one less decision I have to make when I first wake

10
00:00:31,835 --> 00:00:34,715
Speaker 2:  up in the morning. So I've started trying to do the same thing with coffee,

11
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:37,875
Speaker 2:  making cold brew. I drink iced coffee of some kind, basically

12
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:41,715
Speaker 2:  365 days a year. But I also like the

13
00:00:41,715 --> 00:00:45,315
Speaker 2:  idea of being able to do it the night before and then wake up and the thing

14
00:00:45,315 --> 00:00:48,595
Speaker 2:  is ready for me and I just pour it and start the day that seems nicer than

15
00:00:48,595 --> 00:00:52,195
Speaker 2:  what I do now, which is like a 10 minute process of weighing things

16
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:56,435
Speaker 2:  on a scale and gently pouring in concentric circles. It's just

17
00:00:56,515 --> 00:01:00,435
Speaker 2:  too much. But boy, did I not realize

18
00:01:00,815 --> 00:01:04,675
Speaker 2:  how deep the rabbit hole of cold brew is. The ratios, the

19
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:08,675
Speaker 2:  amount of time you're supposed to do it for, the thing you put the cold brew

20
00:01:08,695 --> 00:01:12,155
Speaker 2:  in, it's supposed to be really simple. You put in beans, you pour in water,

21
00:01:13,295 --> 00:01:16,235
Speaker 2:  the end time happens and then you have coffee.

22
00:01:17,265 --> 00:01:20,915
Speaker 2:  Nope. Turns out like all coffee things. It is super complicated.

23
00:01:21,175 --> 00:01:24,985
Speaker 2:  But luckily for me, this is what we're doing on The Vergecast today is

24
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:28,465
Speaker 2:  we're talking about coffee for this episode, which is the second episode

25
00:01:28,465 --> 00:01:31,025
Speaker 2:  in our mini series that we've been calling How to Make It in the Future.

26
00:01:31,645 --> 00:01:35,065
Speaker 2:  I'm talking to a guy named David Cogan, who you might know as the

27
00:01:35,145 --> 00:01:38,705
Speaker 2:  Unlocker on YouTube. He's been a tech creator for a really long time

28
00:01:38,795 --> 00:01:42,465
Speaker 2:  doing lots of reporting and lots of cool camera test videos

29
00:01:42,905 --> 00:01:46,825
Speaker 2:  recently, and he's been a creator on YouTube since like 2009. He's been around

30
00:01:46,825 --> 00:01:50,585
Speaker 2:  this for a long time, and very recently he opened a coffee shop,

31
00:01:50,975 --> 00:01:54,505
Speaker 2:  just a full left turn pivot

32
00:01:54,845 --> 00:01:58,505
Speaker 2:  in his career. He's still a YouTuber. He still wants to be a creator.

33
00:01:58,655 --> 00:02:02,105
Speaker 2:  He's still trying to make all that work, but he also opened a coffee shop

34
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:05,665
Speaker 2:  in Brooklyn, and I have a lot of questions about that. I think this question

35
00:02:05,685 --> 00:02:09,025
Speaker 2:  of what does it mean to marry those two things and

36
00:02:09,885 --> 00:02:13,665
Speaker 2:  can you be both a small business owner and a content creator

37
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:17,905
Speaker 2:  without those things blurring together. I had a really

38
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:21,625
Speaker 2:  fun time talking to him, and I think you're gonna enjoy this conversation

39
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,945
Speaker 2:  too. He had a lot of thoughts about what it means to be a creator, what it

40
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:28,745
Speaker 2:  means to be a coffee shop owner, how the grind

41
00:02:28,765 --> 00:02:32,585
Speaker 2:  of YouTube changes the way that you think about your career and

42
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:36,505
Speaker 2:  what you want out of your life. Why making YouTube videos and

43
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:39,985
Speaker 2:  being a creator is so intoxicating in the first place. It was incredibly

44
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:43,505
Speaker 2:  fun. I had a really good time hanging out with him in his coffee shop

45
00:02:43,845 --> 00:02:47,745
Speaker 2:  in Brooklyn. We're gonna get to all of that But first. Apparently

46
00:02:47,785 --> 00:02:51,625
Speaker 2:  I have to do cold brew 24 hours ahead of time, so I'm gonna go do that.

47
00:02:51,695 --> 00:02:55,185
Speaker 2:  Then I'll come back. Then we'll get into it. This is The Vergecast. We'll

48
00:02:55,185 --> 00:02:55,545
Speaker 2:  be right back.

49
00:03:32,475 --> 00:03:35,995
Speaker 2:  assumed I was on the wrong block or had overshot and turned around,

50
00:03:36,615 --> 00:03:40,235
Speaker 2:  but I wasn't. I was in the right place. I found the shop with this white

51
00:03:40,295 --> 00:03:43,835
Speaker 2:  coffee emoji light and a green check mark emoji light on the front,

52
00:03:44,095 --> 00:03:47,955
Speaker 2:  and otherwise no sign whatsoever that this is a coffee

53
00:03:47,985 --> 00:03:51,275
Speaker 2:  shop, which means it's a very like cool hipster coffee shop. That's how you

54
00:03:51,275 --> 00:03:55,235
Speaker 2:  know they're doing it. Found the place, went inside and found

55
00:03:55,315 --> 00:03:59,155
Speaker 2:  a spot to sit. So I ordered a bacon, egg

56
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:02,995
Speaker 2:  and cheese personal pie. Not a hundred percent sure what

57
00:04:02,995 --> 00:04:06,715
Speaker 2:  that means, but we're about to find out and I got a large coffee that I'm

58
00:04:06,715 --> 00:04:09,995
Speaker 2:  very excited to try. It looks like the coffee here is called Founder's Blend,

59
00:04:09,995 --> 00:04:13,835
Speaker 2:  which is extremely on brand. I approve now.

60
00:04:14,215 --> 00:04:17,315
Speaker 2:  The plan is just to sit here, try to get some work done,

61
00:04:18,345 --> 00:04:22,275
Speaker 2:  have aggressively judgy thoughts about the wifi and all the coffee gear

62
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:26,115
Speaker 2:  they're using here, and then wait for David to show up.

63
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:30,435
Speaker 2:  Let's do this. I found out later, by the way, that David himself

64
00:04:30,695 --> 00:04:34,435
Speaker 2:  had made that pie. It was very good. One of those like hand pie

65
00:04:34,545 --> 00:04:38,235
Speaker 2:  size things that comes in a little personal Tin Delicious, no notes.

66
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:42,875
Speaker 2:  The wifi in there was also extremely fast. There were so many

67
00:04:42,945 --> 00:04:45,955
Speaker 2:  outlets in the room that it actually kind of made me laugh, trying to count

68
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:49,715
Speaker 2:  them all. And the coffee year was also pretty on point. I had

69
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:53,315
Speaker 2:  annoyingly few complaints in my first couple of hours at Coffee Check

70
00:04:53,935 --> 00:04:57,835
Speaker 2:  At about 10 30. David himself showed up. He'd been out filming for the

71
00:04:57,835 --> 00:05:01,635
Speaker 2:  morning, but he came in, stopped at the counter, said hi to the baristas,

72
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,635
Speaker 2:  checked in to see how things were going, and then came over and said hi to

73
00:05:04,635 --> 00:05:08,435
Speaker 2:  me. He gave me a quick tour of the place, the shop in the front, the

74
00:05:08,435 --> 00:05:11,715
Speaker 2:  production studio in the back. We walked around the kitchen. He was very

75
00:05:11,715 --> 00:05:14,955
Speaker 2:  excited about an outlet thing that you could press on the counter and it

76
00:05:14,955 --> 00:05:18,915
Speaker 2:  would pop up. He showed me all the USBC ports. He was very excited

77
00:05:18,915 --> 00:05:22,435
Speaker 2:  about that. There were a bunch of e-bikes just sitting around. There was

78
00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:26,315
Speaker 2:  a gigantic Samsung TV that he'd been sent to review. It all felt very familiar

79
00:05:26,895 --> 00:05:30,435
Speaker 2:  to me as a person who has too many gadgets and loves

80
00:05:30,635 --> 00:05:34,275
Speaker 2:  USBC. And then at the end of our tour, we sat down in this

81
00:05:34,465 --> 00:05:38,115
Speaker 2:  huge podcast booth that he got from Finland at a huge

82
00:05:38,395 --> 00:05:42,115
Speaker 2:  discount in exchange for letting the company use it for occasional demos

83
00:05:42,115 --> 00:05:45,395
Speaker 2:  and sales tours. It's so big they like didn't have a place to put it.

84
00:05:46,255 --> 00:05:50,075
Speaker 2:  So his studio is now also the sales

85
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:53,875
Speaker 2:  floor for this podcast booth. It's wild, but it seems to work.

86
00:05:53,975 --> 00:05:57,885
Speaker 2:  It fits four people and three cameras in it all at once, just in

87
00:05:57,885 --> 00:06:01,565
Speaker 2:  this little booth. And so while the coffee shop continued to

88
00:06:01,565 --> 00:06:05,445
Speaker 2:  operate around us, David and I sat down and recorded this episode. I

89
00:06:05,445 --> 00:06:09,325
Speaker 2:  asked him to begin with just to tell me his story and to start with the

90
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:12,965
Speaker 2:  story of how coffee became part of his whole persona and brand

91
00:06:13,145 --> 00:06:16,155
Speaker 2:  in the first place. So I started doing these videos

92
00:06:17,275 --> 00:06:19,995
Speaker 2:  occasionally where I would do like a battery test or a camera comparison.

93
00:06:20,135 --> 00:06:23,555
Speaker 2:  And I, I was just kind of interested in vlogging and that kind of style,

94
00:06:23,555 --> 00:06:25,995
Speaker 2:  but I wasn't doing that on the channel because I was a tech channel. And

95
00:06:25,995 --> 00:06:29,755
Speaker 2:  So I started kind of making these battery tests and these camera

96
00:06:29,755 --> 00:06:33,635
Speaker 2:  tests while kind of bouncing around and like filming them in a very vlog

97
00:06:33,835 --> 00:06:35,195
Speaker 2:  esque style for those

98
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,435
Speaker 4:  Not familiar, a complete walkthrough on those channels where I try to go

99
00:06:37,435 --> 00:06:40,035
Speaker 4:  through every single feature on a new device that I possibly can so you guys

100
00:06:40,035 --> 00:06:43,075
Speaker 4:  are better prepared should you be in the market to actually go buy one. Now

101
00:06:43,075 --> 00:06:45,355
Speaker 4:  with that said, there is a lot to go through.

102
00:06:45,895 --> 00:06:49,475
Speaker 2:  And then I just kinda like somewhere between like Casey and I Stat and Marquez

103
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:53,035
Speaker 2:  Brownley was like, sure, stylistically, like Dead center was where you were

104
00:06:53,035 --> 00:06:56,195
Speaker 2:  in Sidious with like, yeah, with like, yeah, that's, let's go with that.

105
00:06:56,195 --> 00:07:00,035
Speaker 2:  Yeah, because it was like not, not terribly technical, but not, but also

106
00:07:00,035 --> 00:07:02,555
Speaker 2:  just kind of like running around and showing you things. Yeah, yeah, right.

107
00:07:03,195 --> 00:07:06,915
Speaker 2:  And then editing it to a beat. So yeah, so that happened a bit

108
00:07:06,975 --> 00:07:10,915
Speaker 2:  and then pandemic happened and during that I was filming in my apartment,

109
00:07:10,995 --> 00:07:14,875
Speaker 2:  like everywhere other CRA was doing it. And I like kind of lost my

110
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,795
Speaker 2:  mind as we all did and as soon as like we were allowed really to kind of

111
00:07:17,795 --> 00:07:21,035
Speaker 2:  go outside again, I was like, screw, I'm filming this outside now because

112
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:24,635
Speaker 2:  I've just done however many videos, literally in on the same coffee table

113
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,675
Speaker 2:  and So I went outside and just naturally went and got a coffee

114
00:07:29,695 --> 00:07:32,955
Speaker 2:  in the beginning of the video and sat down and got my coffee and I went Coffee

115
00:07:32,955 --> 00:07:36,595
Speaker 2:  Check. Like I got a coffee, right? Coffee Check. And then

116
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:40,035
Speaker 2:  I, then I would talk about the phone a little bit and then I kinda bounced

117
00:07:40,035 --> 00:07:43,955
Speaker 2:  around and I did that. And then the, I posted that and, and I even,

118
00:07:44,035 --> 00:07:46,395
Speaker 2:  I think even talked about like history in the first one. I like kind of just

119
00:07:46,395 --> 00:07:49,395
Speaker 2:  went off the rails a little bit 'cause I was losing my mind. Sure. And but

120
00:07:49,395 --> 00:07:52,795
Speaker 2:  you didn't do that going like, I have just invented a catchphrase. No. Okay.

121
00:07:52,855 --> 00:07:56,755
Speaker 2:  Not at all. I literally just naturally went Coffee Check, like I got

122
00:07:56,755 --> 00:08:00,355
Speaker 2:  it. That was it. Yeah. And then I went away and then posted that people were

123
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,555
Speaker 2:  stoked and they were just like, this is so different and fun and whatever.

124
00:08:02,555 --> 00:08:06,475
Speaker 2:  And I was like, oh, you like this too? Oh great. 'cause I

125
00:08:06,475 --> 00:08:09,915
Speaker 2:  enjoy this. And so then I started doing more and more of that and I did a

126
00:08:09,915 --> 00:08:13,315
Speaker 2:  few, and I got comments. They were like, where's the coffee?

127
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:18,195
Speaker 2:  And I was like, oh, oh, this is a thing now. And I

128
00:08:18,195 --> 00:08:21,195
Speaker 2:  didn't realize, okay. And then in the next video I went Coffee Check and

129
00:08:21,195 --> 00:08:22,955
Speaker 2:  like got the coffee. Like there was a few videos that didn't have coffee.

130
00:08:22,955 --> 00:08:26,795
Speaker 2:  And I mean, people were upset. So people told you it was a bit

131
00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:29,995
Speaker 2:  before you realized it was a bit correct. It was, it was the audience that

132
00:08:29,995 --> 00:08:33,795
Speaker 2:  told me interest that I had to do a bit. That's so funny. And that just became

133
00:08:33,795 --> 00:08:37,595
Speaker 2:  a thing. So do you then take that thing and you're like, okay,

134
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:41,075
Speaker 2:  coffee is now part of what I do here.

135
00:08:42,175 --> 00:08:45,955
Speaker 2:  How can I blow this out? Right. Like I, there there's a,

136
00:08:45,955 --> 00:08:49,755
Speaker 2:  there's a particularly like ruthless thing you could do in that moment

137
00:08:49,755 --> 00:08:52,195
Speaker 2:  that's like, okay, coffee's part of my thing now who's gonna be my coffee

138
00:08:52,195 --> 00:08:55,925
Speaker 2:  sponsor? Hmm. I'm gonna start selling a coffee mug as merch. Like

139
00:08:55,975 --> 00:08:59,445
Speaker 2:  there, there's a, there's a very simple, like, how do I monetize this road

140
00:08:59,445 --> 00:09:02,005
Speaker 2:  that you can go down in that moment? Correct. Did you start going down that

141
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:05,045
Speaker 2:  road? I think in my head I was like, oh, wouldn't it be really cool if I

142
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,125
Speaker 2:  had a coffee sponsor? Okay. But I never, there was never any, anything beyond

143
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:12,005
Speaker 2:  that. I was never like, oh, I'm gonna go find one. But if we're honest, that's

144
00:09:12,005 --> 00:09:15,885
Speaker 2:  also because I don't generally reach out to sponsors. Like, and

145
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:18,925
Speaker 2:  I'm very fortunate in that way that like most sponsors have come to me and

146
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,885
Speaker 2:  then I kind of decide whether I wanna work with them or not. And it just

147
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:24,045
Speaker 2:  happened to be, there wasn't any conference sponsors that had come and I,

148
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:27,645
Speaker 2:  I think I did, I did one, which I was very excited about to this point, Apress

149
00:09:27,645 --> 00:09:31,165
Speaker 2:  came out and did a, an integration in a video where I made an arrow press

150
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:35,045
Speaker 2:  with, you know, the S 24 alter or whatever it was at the time. And so that

151
00:09:35,045 --> 00:09:38,765
Speaker 2:  was, that was really neat. But it was never like a, I wasn't trying to go

152
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:41,925
Speaker 2:  do that. It just felt like, oh, wouldn't it be, it'd be great fit if someone

153
00:09:41,925 --> 00:09:45,915
Speaker 2:  reached out and did that. Right. I've been watching David's videos

154
00:09:46,255 --> 00:09:49,995
Speaker 2:  on the Unlocker for a long time, and it's honestly sort of shocking to me

155
00:09:49,995 --> 00:09:53,955
Speaker 2:  that he doesn't have more coffee content. So many of his

156
00:09:53,955 --> 00:09:57,755
Speaker 2:  videos start with a quick intro to the video, like, what's about to happen?

157
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:01,995
Speaker 2:  And then he just barrels the camera and goes, first things first, and

158
00:10:01,995 --> 00:10:04,795
Speaker 2:  then there's a long montage of him getting coffee at some cool place around

159
00:10:04,795 --> 00:10:08,715
Speaker 2:  New York. And then he goes, Coffee, Check. And then the video starts. That's,

160
00:10:08,715 --> 00:10:12,515
Speaker 2:  that's the thing. It's a good bit. But like lots of people drink

161
00:10:12,575 --> 00:10:16,195
Speaker 2:  coffee, you know what I mean? And I've always wondered whether he was

162
00:10:16,195 --> 00:10:19,675
Speaker 2:  really into coffee this way or if that ends up being just a useful

163
00:10:20,355 --> 00:10:23,755
Speaker 2:  construct to set up a lot of these videos. Like I've filmed camera tests

164
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:27,595
Speaker 2:  before. I know how hard it is to find interesting stuff to film and

165
00:10:27,755 --> 00:10:31,595
Speaker 2:  photograph on a camera to show on video. But then again, to be fair,

166
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:36,035
Speaker 2:  we're sitting recording in his coffee shop. So this fact

167
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:39,405
Speaker 2:  should not surprise you. I was a coffee snob. Okay.

168
00:10:39,825 --> 00:10:42,685
Speaker 2:  I'd like to admit that here. That was the word I was trying to not accuse

169
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:45,085
Speaker 2:  you of, but it's fine. I'm glad. No, it's totally fine. I, I've accepted

170
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:48,445
Speaker 2:  it. Anyway, all that coffee love went from

171
00:10:48,905 --> 00:10:52,765
Speaker 2:  intros and arrow press into something very different last year.

172
00:10:53,155 --> 00:10:56,965
Speaker 2:  That was when David's lease was up. He had this space that he'd shared with

173
00:10:56,965 --> 00:11:00,765
Speaker 2:  a couple of other creators just a few blocks away in Brooklyn. And

174
00:11:00,835 --> 00:11:04,365
Speaker 2:  when their lease was ending, he started looking for a new space and

175
00:11:04,845 --> 00:11:08,795
Speaker 2:  a new project. Initially, my idea was to try to make something for

176
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:11,915
Speaker 2:  creators. I wanted to make, like, I wanted a larger space that could then

177
00:11:11,915 --> 00:11:14,955
Speaker 2:  have some sort sort of community. I was just kind of craving that I think

178
00:11:14,985 --> 00:11:18,755
Speaker 2:  like a bigger community of, of creators to like, you know, inspire each other

179
00:11:18,755 --> 00:11:22,475
Speaker 2:  and do other things. And then I was like, okay, cool. Like I, I went looking

180
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:25,995
Speaker 2:  for a space, I found the space that we are currently in and I loved it. And

181
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:29,875
Speaker 2:  then I did the math on, you know, how viable was this

182
00:11:30,195 --> 00:11:33,835
Speaker 2:  business model of like, creators coming in and like, cool, we all, you know,

183
00:11:33,895 --> 00:11:37,235
Speaker 2:  can use this space and film it and whatever. So you're describing like WeWork

184
00:11:37,235 --> 00:11:40,515
Speaker 2:  for creators essentially that. And I literally would've said those at some

185
00:11:40,515 --> 00:11:44,435
Speaker 2:  point to someone I'm sure. So we were for creators and the problem is

186
00:11:44,555 --> 00:11:47,795
Speaker 2:  I realized quickly after finding the space and doing the math was that you

187
00:11:47,825 --> 00:11:51,755
Speaker 2:  have to limit the number of creators that join because, you know, people

188
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:53,820
Speaker 2:  have to be able to film in here and you can't all be in here at the same

189
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,765
Speaker 2:  time when someone's filming. Sure. And so inherently it limits the number

190
00:11:56,765 --> 00:11:59,725
Speaker 2:  of members you can have, which means you have to charge a lot more. New York

191
00:11:59,725 --> 00:12:03,565
Speaker 2:  rent is not cheap. It just made zero sense. And I'm went Cool, great. Done.

192
00:12:03,565 --> 00:12:07,285
Speaker 2:  Glad I figured that out before I started. And then I was literally in the

193
00:12:07,285 --> 00:12:10,845
Speaker 2:  space and be like, what else can I do with this? 'cause I just really liked

194
00:12:11,045 --> 00:12:15,005
Speaker 2:  it. And originally when I walked in, I I, I immediately thought, okay, a

195
00:12:15,005 --> 00:12:17,965
Speaker 2:  roastery, I would love to have a roastery one. I would love to do something

196
00:12:17,965 --> 00:12:20,125
Speaker 2:  with my hands. I've just been a creative for so long. They like, I feel like

197
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:23,925
Speaker 2:  we all crave that to some degree at some point. And I love coffee. It was

198
00:12:23,925 --> 00:12:25,765
Speaker 2:  already part of the brand. I was like, okay, well now this also makes a little

199
00:12:25,765 --> 00:12:29,405
Speaker 2:  bit more sense. So maybe I could start a roastery. I could roast my own coffee

200
00:12:30,145 --> 00:12:32,965
Speaker 2:  and, and that could be my merch. I could then sell that to the audience.

201
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,445
Speaker 2:  I can sell that to wherever, maybe other stores. You become your own coffee

202
00:12:35,445 --> 00:12:39,005
Speaker 2:  sponsor. I become my own coffee sponsor in every video was definitely part

203
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:41,165
Speaker 2:  of that. Okay. Right. Like, and I, and I've been doing that the last few

204
00:12:41,165 --> 00:12:43,205
Speaker 2:  videos. I'm sorry to anyone who's listening, been watching my videos. I'm

205
00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:45,165
Speaker 2:  so sorry. I'm keep doing it for a little bit longer. So your thought was

206
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:48,845
Speaker 2:  like, maybe I'll just do this myself. Like this will be a, a

207
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:52,325
Speaker 2:  something. It's, it seems like a side project. Is that,

208
00:12:52,665 --> 00:12:55,325
Speaker 2:  is it, is it, is it the side project or is YouTube No, the side. No, I'm

209
00:12:55,325 --> 00:12:58,765
Speaker 2:  just kidding. We're gonna get to that. Yeah. Yeah. I would say, yeah, it

210
00:12:58,765 --> 00:13:02,325
Speaker 2:  was, it was kind of just like a, hey, this felt like a good, I don't know,

211
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:02,605
Speaker 2:  like

212
00:13:04,685 --> 00:13:06,405
Speaker 2:  a side project, let's just call it side project. But that's what it was.

213
00:13:06,405 --> 00:13:08,685
Speaker 2:  It was felt like a good cyber project that also though had a lot of ties

214
00:13:08,685 --> 00:13:11,765
Speaker 2:  in with what I was already doing, which is another reason why I did it. For

215
00:13:11,765 --> 00:13:13,845
Speaker 2:  sure. 'cause if it didn't have that, it wouldn't have made as much sense.

216
00:13:13,845 --> 00:13:16,685
Speaker 2:  It was just like, cool, let me, you know, I already have no time. Like I'm,

217
00:13:16,705 --> 00:13:19,925
Speaker 2:  I'm as busy as it was with YouTube, right. Asking anyone that knows me. They're

218
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:21,965
Speaker 2:  like, yep, David's always busy. Yeah. So like, then I was like, cool, lemme

219
00:13:21,965 --> 00:13:25,605
Speaker 2:  start another business was probably not the best idea, but it's okay. So

220
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:29,045
Speaker 2:  wait, but on that front, actually, like in those first moments,

221
00:13:29,715 --> 00:13:32,645
Speaker 2:  like if, if the spectrum of ambition is like

222
00:13:33,865 --> 00:13:37,245
Speaker 2:  guy brewing beer in his basement all the way to

223
00:13:37,595 --> 00:13:41,565
Speaker 2:  like, I wanna start Starbucks, where,

224
00:13:41,565 --> 00:13:44,725
Speaker 2:  where would you say your ambition was? Way closer to the guy in the basement.

225
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:48,245
Speaker 2:  Okay. Yeah. No, I, 'cause like, I don't, and and it's funny 'cause even people

226
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:52,165
Speaker 2:  have said stuff to me about like, oh, when you can open your next one and

227
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,965
Speaker 2:  do, you know, like, I'm like, oh, I'm, no, I'm never, it's not gonna happen

228
00:13:54,965 --> 00:13:58,845
Speaker 2:  because like, it's so much work for just one. Yeah. And

229
00:13:58,845 --> 00:14:02,125
Speaker 2:  I, and I kind of like the idea of it being a smaller thing. The point wasn't

230
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:05,405
Speaker 2:  to make an empire out of this thing, it was just to do something good. Okay.

231
00:14:05,405 --> 00:14:08,925
Speaker 2:  Right. Something that like, felt good for me, generates revenue. Sure. But

232
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:12,085
Speaker 2:  I mean, you know, more So I right now. I just care that it has its own bills.

233
00:14:12,605 --> 00:14:16,565
Speaker 2:  Like that's all I really hope for. That's right. And, and it just was

234
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:19,685
Speaker 2:  something that like, yeah, I was something I, it something felt good about

235
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:23,045
Speaker 2:  the idea and it wasn't necessarily like building an empire.

236
00:14:24,235 --> 00:14:27,405
Speaker 2:  Okay, we have to take a break, but when we get back, we're gonna talk about

237
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:31,205
Speaker 2:  how you actually do all of this. Because it's one thing to say,

238
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:35,245
Speaker 2:  oh, I'd love to open a coffee shop. Honestly, I feel like lots of

239
00:14:35,245 --> 00:14:38,485
Speaker 2:  people have at one point had that specific dream. You know what I mean?

240
00:14:39,235 --> 00:14:43,045
Speaker 2:  Mine personally is not a coffee shop. It's to like, throw all this

241
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:46,245
Speaker 2:  away and go open a divy sports bar somewhere.

242
00:14:46,915 --> 00:14:50,685
Speaker 2:  It's even another thing to actually find and lease a

243
00:14:50,685 --> 00:14:54,605
Speaker 2:  space and say, okay, I'll figure this out later. And

244
00:14:54,605 --> 00:14:58,405
Speaker 2:  then to decide I'm gonna do a roastery and then I'm gonna do a coffee

245
00:14:58,435 --> 00:15:02,165
Speaker 2:  shop because there's a door. You, you start to go down this road. But

246
00:15:02,565 --> 00:15:06,205
Speaker 2:  actually pulling all of that off and doing it well and

247
00:15:06,545 --> 00:15:10,165
Speaker 2:  do it without turning it into the exact thing and

248
00:15:10,255 --> 00:15:13,525
Speaker 2:  grind and lifestyle that you're trying to get away from in the first place,

249
00:15:14,145 --> 00:15:18,125
Speaker 2:  that's all way harder. We're gonna talk about how all of

250
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,405
Speaker 2:  that went for David. We'll be right back.

251
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:28,605
Speaker 3:  Support for this episode comes from AWS. With the power

252
00:15:28,605 --> 00:15:32,485
Speaker 3:  of AWS generative AI teams can get relevant fast

253
00:15:32,485 --> 00:15:36,245

Speaker 3:  power your business and generate real impact with the most

255
00:15:40,035 --> 00:15:41,165
Speaker 3:  experienced cloud.

256
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:48,605
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. So just to reset here, we have David Cogan

257
00:15:48,605 --> 00:15:52,325
Speaker 2:  longtime YouTube creator, tech reporter. Apparently according to his

258
00:16:47,535 --> 00:16:50,255
Speaker 2:  is healthy. We'll have a lot of questions about coffee shopping all way.

259
00:16:50,255 --> 00:16:52,735
Speaker 2:  We can talk about Yeah, we can talk about that. I might need my laptop. We

260
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:56,655
Speaker 2:  can talk about that. But yeah, like how did I

261
00:16:56,655 --> 00:17:00,215
Speaker 2:  go about starting it? So, well first off, so when I did that there roastery

262
00:17:00,215 --> 00:17:02,895
Speaker 2:  idea, I realized that there was frontage, which is essentially just like

263
00:17:02,895 --> 00:17:05,455
Speaker 2:  a term for, there's street access from a door. The street. There's a door.

264
00:17:05,455 --> 00:17:08,335
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So, I might as I might as well. Because if we're gonna be roasting

265
00:17:08,335 --> 00:17:10,455
Speaker 2:  beans in here, there might as well be something in the front where people

266
00:17:10,475 --> 00:17:13,895
Speaker 2:  can just buy them and hang out and sit. And so that's where the coffee shop

267
00:17:13,895 --> 00:17:16,295
Speaker 2:  then came from that. And then this back production space, which is what we're

268
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:20,215
Speaker 2:  in now, just kind of made sense for what I was on YouTube

269
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:22,775
Speaker 2:  and everything else. Do you think about past, you now thinking about it like

270
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,695
Speaker 2:  that? Like, oh, there's space. I might as well do a coffee shop. And you're

271
00:17:25,695 --> 00:17:29,055
Speaker 2:  like, that moron had no idea what he was saying. He was meeting up for he's

272
00:17:29,055 --> 00:17:32,175
Speaker 2:  Nope, nope. Yep. Question that every day. Okay. Yep. Just confused. I I will

273
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:35,095
Speaker 2:  say actually like that's the most like casually I've ever heard someone decide

274
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:38,775
Speaker 2:  to open a coffee shop. Yeah. So I. It's funny because I went from like thinking

275
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:42,535
Speaker 2:  about this to signing a lease in about three months. Oh wow. And so like

276
00:17:43,215 --> 00:17:46,775
Speaker 2:  I look back at that now, one, it was dumb, but, but also there was a blessing

277
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:50,685
Speaker 2:  because I didn't have time to sit, sit there and question all of the things

278
00:17:51,025 --> 00:17:54,325
Speaker 2:  For sure. And like then now it's like, oh, it's too late. Cool. I'll just

279
00:17:54,325 --> 00:17:58,005
Speaker 2:  figure it out. First thing I did was I started to learn as much as I possibly

280
00:17:58,005 --> 00:18:01,845
Speaker 2:  could. I went to coffee events, I went to coffee conventions. I started seeing

281
00:18:01,845 --> 00:18:05,525
Speaker 2:  coffee classes, roasting classes, barista classes. I'm like certified in

282
00:18:05,525 --> 00:18:09,325
Speaker 2:  certain things. Like, because I just like, I just, I think a lot of us do

283
00:18:09,325 --> 00:18:12,205
Speaker 2:  this, especially like most people I know that are in tech stuff. Like if

284
00:18:12,205 --> 00:18:15,205
Speaker 2:  we're gonna do something, we obsess about it. Yeah. Until we're good at it.

285
00:18:15,705 --> 00:18:19,605
Speaker 2:  And So, I started that process first. Okay. Well signed the lease and then

286
00:18:19,605 --> 00:18:22,725
Speaker 2:  went, cool, now I've gotta start this process. Sure. And then the lease wasn't,

287
00:18:22,725 --> 00:18:25,885
Speaker 2:  you know, it took a few months for that to actually start. So this is like,

288
00:18:26,245 --> 00:18:28,205
Speaker 2:  and then during those three months was just as all this is happening. Yeah.

289
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:31,405
Speaker 2:  Correct. So it was like So, I. Think I signed the lease in December. Okay.

290
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:35,285
Speaker 2:  Ish. Yeah. And so like December, January, February, like, and then started

291
00:18:35,645 --> 00:18:39,525
Speaker 2:  starting construction in here. But, so while all of that process was happening,

292
00:18:39,605 --> 00:18:43,405
Speaker 2:  I would fly off to, I think Chicago, I went to the SCA Coffee

293
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:46,605
Speaker 2:  Expo, which is like one of the biggest ones. Took us all of the free classes.

294
00:18:46,635 --> 00:18:49,565
Speaker 2:  They offered as many as I could. Nice. That would fit in my schedule. Went

295
00:18:49,565 --> 00:18:53,445
Speaker 2:  to Javits Center, had one recently I did. Went and did that. Started

296
00:18:53,445 --> 00:18:56,725
Speaker 2:  taking coffee classes at another coffee roastery nearby. Like just

297
00:18:57,525 --> 00:19:01,365
Speaker 2:  obsessed as you do. Yeah. Right. And so that is step one. It's like

298
00:19:01,685 --> 00:19:05,405
Speaker 2:  I felt like I needed to know enough that I could obviously do this thing

299
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:09,925
Speaker 2:  once. And then throughout that process though, it was getting built. So then

300
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:12,645
Speaker 2:  it just took a long time. Took about eight months before it finally,

301
00:19:13,715 --> 00:19:16,895
Speaker 2:  you know, became looking like a coffee shop. Funny about that. And not just

302
00:19:16,895 --> 00:19:20,055
Speaker 2:  a warehouse. You know what's fascinating about that, by the way, and I've

303
00:19:20,055 --> 00:19:23,775
Speaker 2:  been thinking about this ever since we talked in YouTube time, eight months

304
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:27,575
Speaker 2:  is like an eternity. If, you work for eight months on a single project.

305
00:19:27,885 --> 00:19:31,695
Speaker 2:  YouTube's algorithm will almost certainly have forgotten you exist by the

306
00:19:31,695 --> 00:19:35,335
Speaker 2:  time you reappear. You just cannot work on that kind of

307
00:19:35,535 --> 00:19:39,055
Speaker 2:  timeline. But in building terms, like physical, putting up

308
00:19:39,335 --> 00:19:43,295
Speaker 2:  buildings eight months isn't bad. And I think one of the reasons it felt

309
00:19:43,355 --> 00:19:47,215
Speaker 2:  so long to David was that he was actually trying to live in both

310
00:19:47,235 --> 00:19:50,975
Speaker 2:  of those timelines simultaneously. To both be a creator

311
00:19:51,075 --> 00:19:54,975
Speaker 2:  at the pace of the internet demands, but also do this deliberately

312
00:19:55,075 --> 00:19:58,895
Speaker 2:  slower and more personal and more thoughtful thing at

313
00:19:59,015 --> 00:20:02,535
Speaker 2:  the same time. It seems like it might be a healthy balance,

314
00:20:03,355 --> 00:20:07,055
Speaker 2:  but it also seems like it might just tear your brain completely to shreds

315
00:20:07,055 --> 00:20:10,775
Speaker 2:  trying to do both at the same time. For David, I think it was a little bit

316
00:20:10,775 --> 00:20:14,695
Speaker 2:  of both, but mostly the second one, I knew it,

317
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:18,215
Speaker 2:  I knew what I was doing and I did it anyway. Which maybe that was the mistake.

318
00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:22,095
Speaker 2:  Okay. But it was having running two businesses at once, like the YouTube

319
00:20:22,115 --> 00:20:25,095
Speaker 2:  is a full-time business. Like, I don't know anyone knows, but like it's a

320
00:20:25,095 --> 00:20:28,935
Speaker 2:  lot. Yeah. And it's a constant grind and it's very draining. Everybody

321
00:20:28,945 --> 00:20:32,655
Speaker 2:  burns out. Right. It's a very normal thing. Were you burned out on it?

322
00:20:32,885 --> 00:20:35,095
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I think I get burnt out every three months. It just like comes and

323
00:20:35,095 --> 00:20:37,535
Speaker 2:  goes, you know, it's like a cycle. I'm just used to it now. Yeah. But I mean,

324
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:39,455
Speaker 2:  I wonder like you, you, there's a, there's everyone I know what definite

325
00:20:39,575 --> 00:20:42,615
Speaker 2:  I can, there's a definite like armchair psychology thing I could do to you

326
00:20:42,615 --> 00:20:46,455
Speaker 2:  that it is like Yeah. What a lot of people who burn out

327
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:50,205
Speaker 2:  on YouTube do is like make the why I hate YouTube

328
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:54,085
Speaker 2:  video. Yes. Or they like, go make a product or

329
00:20:54,085 --> 00:20:57,045
Speaker 2:  something just as kind of a, a reset to use a different part of your brain

330
00:20:57,115 --> 00:21:00,405
Speaker 2:  Sure. And try to like diversify. And maybe this is what I'm doing is I think

331
00:21:00,405 --> 00:21:03,805
Speaker 2:  you're, what I wonder is like if, if I wanted to really try and like

332
00:21:03,915 --> 00:21:07,365
Speaker 2:  psychoanalyze you, maybe maybe that's a reaction to it where you're like

333
00:21:07,425 --> 00:21:10,085
Speaker 2:  the the grind gets everybody Yes. Like it does, you're absolutely right.

334
00:21:10,105 --> 00:21:13,445
Speaker 2:  For sure. And I can see why it would feel like

335
00:21:14,045 --> 00:21:17,925
Speaker 2:  romantic and exciting to do something so sort of diametrically opposite

336
00:21:17,925 --> 00:21:20,485
Speaker 2:  Totally. Of grind on YouTube every day. Yes. And I think, and again think,

337
00:21:20,605 --> 00:21:23,765
Speaker 2:  I think that's like that, you know, people wanting to do stuff with their

338
00:21:23,885 --> 00:21:26,605
Speaker 2:  hands when they work on the internet, all right's, everybody got sourdough.

339
00:21:26,605 --> 00:21:29,325
Speaker 2:  Correct. Yes. Yeah. You just, I missed that actually. You just went, I wish

340
00:21:29,325 --> 00:21:31,685
Speaker 2:  I got on the sourdough. You went way harder on that. I went, yeah. This is

341
00:21:31,685 --> 00:21:35,605
Speaker 2:  my sourdough. You're Yeah, yeah, that's exactly. Please

342
00:21:35,605 --> 00:21:39,565
Speaker 2:  come in and try my sourdough. No, it's, it's, yeah, I, I, I totally agree

343
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:42,525
Speaker 2:  with that. I think that's, that's definitely a part of it. Even if that was

344
00:21:43,045 --> 00:21:45,565
Speaker 2:  a little more subconscious than like a conscious effort. It was definitely

345
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:49,445
Speaker 2:  a part of it. Okay. But you also kept the YouTubing this

346
00:21:49,545 --> 00:21:53,365
Speaker 2:  of this space. Like there's a I would say what, 60%

347
00:21:53,465 --> 00:21:57,165
Speaker 2:  of the square footage in here? Maybe half 50%. Yeah. Let's say 50 is

348
00:21:57,965 --> 00:22:01,245
Speaker 2:  designed, designed to be like a production space. Correct. Was that part

349
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:04,965
Speaker 2:  of the plan from the beginning? So I always wanted to have that for a number

350
00:22:04,965 --> 00:22:08,365
Speaker 2:  of reasons. Just as a business person was like, I need to differentiate as

351
00:22:08,365 --> 00:22:11,405
Speaker 2:  much as I can in this space 'cause I just gotta pay rent. Sure. And I dunno

352
00:22:11,405 --> 00:22:13,445
Speaker 2:  how long the coffee shop's gonna take. I dunno how long the roastery is gonna

353
00:22:13,445 --> 00:22:15,965
Speaker 2:  take, et cetera. So what's something else that I have some experience in,

354
00:22:15,965 --> 00:22:19,205
Speaker 2:  obviously and was like, that could maybe also help just pay the bills for

355
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:23,085
Speaker 2:  a bit. And I did research on peer space and started to look at all the

356
00:22:23,085 --> 00:22:26,965
Speaker 2:  other like rental studio spaces around here. Realized none of them had a

357
00:22:26,965 --> 00:22:30,045
Speaker 2:  kitchen. And so that was my choice for building the kitchen. It was like

358
00:22:30,045 --> 00:22:32,885
Speaker 2:  cool differentiator kitchen. You know what else? They don't have a podcast

359
00:22:33,015 --> 00:22:36,085
Speaker 2:  booth, which we are in right now. So got that as well. So it's just trying

360
00:22:36,085 --> 00:22:39,885
Speaker 2:  to like create a separate, another business obviously, but another part of

361
00:22:39,885 --> 00:22:42,645
Speaker 2:  this business that like could help pay the rent because that's all I cared

362
00:22:42,645 --> 00:22:46,525
Speaker 2:  about and still do. And so yeah. So that, but,

363
00:22:46,525 --> 00:22:49,605
Speaker 2:  but the truth is like, 'cause this isn't as a, as we were talking about at

364
00:22:49,605 --> 00:22:53,015
Speaker 2:  some point, I don't, I don't need the backspace.

365
00:22:53,535 --> 00:22:57,175
Speaker 2:  Like I film most of my videos outside now as, as we've discussed and So I

366
00:22:57,175 --> 00:23:00,895
Speaker 2:  don't really need to have a space that I'm gonna film in. I

367
00:23:01,055 --> 00:23:04,815
Speaker 2:  I, the bigger intent was for this to get rented out help pay rent. But

368
00:23:05,295 --> 00:23:09,015
Speaker 2:  I do use it and I, I also kind of designed some things within here.

369
00:23:09,395 --> 00:23:13,375
Speaker 2:  For example, the kitchen has a very standard width of the oven. That

370
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:16,695
Speaker 2:  way it can be swamped out so that maybe I can start doing appliance videos

371
00:23:17,035 --> 00:23:20,615
Speaker 2:  and not just phones and laptops and bikes and whatever else I do that are

372
00:23:20,615 --> 00:23:23,895
Speaker 2:  outside of the kitchen that are not as large. Can't do any of that in my

373
00:23:23,895 --> 00:23:27,255
Speaker 2:  apartment because it's, I rent it. Right. They won't let me. Yeah. And then

374
00:23:27,255 --> 00:23:29,775
Speaker 2:  I did the same thing for the fridge. The fridge is positioned in a way where

375
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,055
Speaker 2:  it's on the side where I could get a doubles size fridge and it would still

376
00:23:32,195 --> 00:23:35,815
Speaker 2:  fit. And I tried to do those as many of the things as possible. Same thing

377
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:39,695
Speaker 2:  with the, I'm never gonna mount a TV in here because I wanna be able to

378
00:23:39,695 --> 00:23:42,455
Speaker 2:  swap them out to do more TV reviews is something else. I would like So I

379
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:46,405
Speaker 2:  try to add some elements of the space to benefit my YouTube

380
00:23:46,405 --> 00:23:49,925
Speaker 2:  channel in some way. But it was, it's, it's a small percentage of what the

381
00:23:49,925 --> 00:23:53,125
Speaker 2:  space should be used for. Right. Really need to just rent it out. Okay. That

382
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:57,045
Speaker 2:  makes sense. So, and to that point actually more broadly, like how

383
00:23:57,785 --> 00:24:01,505
Speaker 2:  did you think about sort of connecting the coffee

384
00:24:01,535 --> 00:24:05,505
Speaker 2:  shop to the YouTube channel? There are a bunch of ways in

385
00:24:05,505 --> 00:24:08,665
Speaker 2:  which they are very connected, including the name. Like, it's, it's Yes.

386
00:24:08,845 --> 00:24:11,745
Speaker 2:  You, you said Coffee Check in a lot of your videos you open a coffee shop

387
00:24:11,745 --> 00:24:15,385
Speaker 2:  called Coffee Check. Yes. Which is dumb to anyone who doesn't know the YouTube

388
00:24:15,385 --> 00:24:17,985
Speaker 2:  channel, but it's fine. There's a, there's an easy thing you could have done

389
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:21,545
Speaker 2:  right. Back to the like, how do I monetize this thing on my channel question?

390
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:25,385
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Where you make this whole thing

391
00:24:26,255 --> 00:24:29,665
Speaker 2:  kind of about your YouTube channel, right. And you have a TV that's always

392
00:24:29,665 --> 00:24:33,345
Speaker 2:  playing your videos terrible and hate that so much. And you're, and it's

393
00:24:33,345 --> 00:24:36,305
Speaker 2:  the background of all of your videos and you try to make these things sort

394
00:24:36,305 --> 00:24:39,825
Speaker 2:  of symbiotic. Yeah. My sense is you have like

395
00:24:39,825 --> 00:24:43,705
Speaker 2:  deliberately run the other direction Yes. Of that except for the little

396
00:24:43,705 --> 00:24:47,185
Speaker 2:  touches of the name. Like why, why not push these two things closer together?

397
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:50,905
Speaker 2:  So to me, I think I wanted to make sure that I could do a good coffee shop

398
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:53,745
Speaker 2:  and that it stood on its own for that. I didn't want it to have anything

399
00:24:53,745 --> 00:24:56,865
Speaker 2:  to do with the YouTube channel as far as like, you know, you know, I dread

400
00:24:56,865 --> 00:25:00,545
Speaker 2:  those, those headlines that are influencer opens coffee

401
00:25:00,615 --> 00:25:04,145
Speaker 2:  shop. Right. And then, which are inevitable sometimes a lot of the people

402
00:25:04,145 --> 00:25:07,665
Speaker 2:  go to those coffee shops though. Yeah. Which is, which is great. But like,

403
00:25:07,775 --> 00:25:10,865
Speaker 2:  there's, there's an implied, like a lot of people don't like that word. A

404
00:25:10,865 --> 00:25:13,825
Speaker 2:  lot of people don't sure don't know what an influencer does or, you know,

405
00:25:13,825 --> 00:25:16,145
Speaker 2:  and I don't, I don't think I would ever call myself an influencer, but, you

406
00:25:16,145 --> 00:25:19,545
Speaker 2:  know, media marketing company call me that. So it's fine, you know, but it's

407
00:25:19,545 --> 00:25:23,505
Speaker 2:  like there's a connotation there that I think that is

408
00:25:23,745 --> 00:25:27,065
Speaker 2:  negative in a lot of people's minds. And I didn't want that. Firstly, I also

409
00:25:27,065 --> 00:25:29,985
Speaker 2:  just, again, I wanted this to be, to live on its own. I wanted it to kind

410
00:25:29,985 --> 00:25:32,745
Speaker 2:  of be Easter eggs for people that know, like the Coffee Check symbol, like

411
00:25:32,745 --> 00:25:35,825
Speaker 2:  the name. Right. But everything else is just, oh, it's just the local coffee

412
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:38,825
Speaker 2:  shop that we enjoy and we like, and it's just, you know, whatever. That's

413
00:25:38,825 --> 00:25:42,545
Speaker 2:  it. I didn't want it. I, I think on the YouTube channel, I don't mind doing

414
00:25:42,545 --> 00:25:45,505
Speaker 2:  the other way around. Right. Because for me to, on YouTube to be like, Hey,

415
00:25:45,505 --> 00:25:48,065
Speaker 2:  here's the coffee shop that I made. And like, come check it out. And like,

416
00:25:48,065 --> 00:25:51,465
Speaker 2:  here it is and filming in it, I feel like there's less of a, like,

417
00:25:52,295 --> 00:25:55,745
Speaker 2:  it's, it's less weird to me that people on YouTube know I have a coffee shop.

418
00:25:55,775 --> 00:25:58,105
Speaker 2:  It's more weird to me that the people in the coffee shop know I have a YouTube

419
00:25:58,105 --> 00:26:01,825
Speaker 2:  channel. Interesting. Yeah. Does that make sense? Yes. And yet

420
00:26:02,345 --> 00:26:05,665
Speaker 2:  I feel like every time you bring it up on your channel, you apologize for

421
00:26:05,785 --> 00:26:08,425
Speaker 2:  bringing it up. Absolutely. Why? Because I'm annoying.

422
00:26:09,965 --> 00:26:13,825
Speaker 2:  I'm, because a big part of it is that I keep bringing it up

423
00:26:14,085 --> 00:26:17,745
Speaker 2:  and I'm, I'm doing that partially because I need to like, get word out about

424
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:21,345
Speaker 2:  the coffee shop to some degree. And, and like, and so it's almost like, feels

425
00:26:21,345 --> 00:26:25,185
Speaker 2:  like a bit of an ad to myself. Right? So I don't want, you know, so I'm apologizing

426
00:26:25,185 --> 00:26:27,705
Speaker 2:  for that and, but, and everyone has been very sweet, which I, I very much

427
00:26:27,705 --> 00:26:30,025
Speaker 2:  appreciate all the comments have been like, dude, don't apologize. Like,

428
00:26:30,135 --> 00:26:32,745
Speaker 2:  amazing. Like, so glad you're like, you know, living a dream, whatever. And

429
00:26:32,745 --> 00:26:36,105
Speaker 2:  it's very, very, very sweet. So I, So I do appreciate that. I, this is the

430
00:26:36,105 --> 00:26:39,545
Speaker 2:  thing. I still feel like I'm gonna apologize, so it's fine. But this is the

431
00:26:39,545 --> 00:26:43,205
Speaker 2:  weird thing about being a, a creator in this moment, I think Right. Where

432
00:26:43,205 --> 00:26:47,005
Speaker 2:  like, you could, your point about Influencer Opens coffee shop

433
00:26:47,025 --> 00:26:50,005
Speaker 2:  is like, I I tend to agree with you that it feels sort of gross. Yeah. But

434
00:26:50,005 --> 00:26:53,885
Speaker 2:  like, a lot of people will go to that coffee shop because for

435
00:26:54,085 --> 00:26:57,125
Speaker 2:  whatever reason they feel attached to that person. Sure. And that's a thing

436
00:26:57,145 --> 00:27:01,005
Speaker 2:  you can you to for evil or for good.

437
00:27:01,005 --> 00:27:03,765
Speaker 2:  Right? Yeah, true. But If you use it for, we've seen it used both by many

438
00:27:03,765 --> 00:27:06,565
Speaker 2:  people. Right, right. And, but I think If, you use it for good. There's not,

439
00:27:06,565 --> 00:27:09,525
Speaker 2:  there's nothing inherently wrong with it. Right. And I think like even what

440
00:27:09,525 --> 00:27:12,805
Speaker 2:  your original story about how Coffee Check became a thing,

441
00:27:13,435 --> 00:27:16,765
Speaker 2:  it's like that that's people being connected to you as a person and like

442
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:18,525
Speaker 2:  they want to know what you're up to and they wanna know where you're going

443
00:27:18,525 --> 00:27:20,765
Speaker 2:  and you're traveling and their Yeah. Where am I getting the coffee? Right.

444
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:23,805
Speaker 2:  And so you you get to a point where it's like, okay, actually what I'm doing

445
00:27:23,805 --> 00:27:27,765
Speaker 2:  is I'm bringing you along on this ride with me. Correct. And

446
00:27:27,765 --> 00:27:30,485
Speaker 2:  that, that would've just required a very different approach. Like to some

447
00:27:30,485 --> 00:27:34,205
Speaker 2:  extent, it's surprising to me that you didn't make eight months of videos

448
00:27:34,425 --> 00:27:37,485
Speaker 2:  out of building the coffee shop. Seriously. Like a lot of creators would've

449
00:27:37,485 --> 00:27:40,165
Speaker 2:  done that. Yeah. I dunno if it's pride. It's something there's like, I want

450
00:27:40,165 --> 00:27:44,125
Speaker 2:  this to stand on its own, I want to do a good job at this. Right.

451
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:47,165
Speaker 2:  You want it to work because it's good. Not because theoretically Yeah. I

452
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,045
Speaker 2:  want have, I, I don't want that to influence it in any way. Interesting.

453
00:27:50,285 --> 00:27:54,045
Speaker 2:  I want it to just do well. I want to have this coffee shop do well the roastery

454
00:27:54,045 --> 00:27:58,005
Speaker 2:  do well because they merit such things, not because

455
00:27:58,745 --> 00:28:01,645
Speaker 2:  of some other outside influencer marketing or whatever else. Right. So, I

456
00:28:01,645 --> 00:28:05,245
Speaker 2:  mean. So I've seen enough creators hawk the things that they're doing

457
00:28:05,465 --> 00:28:08,125
Speaker 2:  and kind of being like, Hey, yeah, I'll do, I'm doing, I made this thing

458
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:10,805
Speaker 2:  and like, you know, I wanted to actually do something with my hands. Like

459
00:28:10,805 --> 00:28:13,405
Speaker 2:  be in the space. Like, not just like white label something, like actually

460
00:28:13,515 --> 00:28:16,965
Speaker 2:  make it do the things and that, and like, I dunno, I think there's,

461
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:22,005
Speaker 2:  I think I start to also a good way to put it too. Right? I think I start

462
00:28:22,005 --> 00:28:25,965
Speaker 2:  to skew my own data when I introduce those other things. If I want to make

463
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:29,845
Speaker 2:  sure that this does well on its own, I need to not kind of push all of those

464
00:28:29,845 --> 00:28:33,805
Speaker 2:  other things into it because then I won't know what helped it do. Well I

465
00:28:33,805 --> 00:28:37,565
Speaker 2:  have a very long lease. Right. I did that on purpose. I want this to be a

466
00:28:37,565 --> 00:28:41,045
Speaker 2:  thing that doesn't just like get a bump of traffic because of influencer

467
00:28:41,235 --> 00:28:44,965
Speaker 2:  word and then dies. Hmm. Right. So it needs to be something that literally

468
00:28:44,965 --> 00:28:47,525
Speaker 2:  just can like, be a part of the neighborhood and be a good thing and grow

469
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:51,045
Speaker 2:  with the neighborhood and, and outlast my YouTube channel. Right. This is

470
00:28:51,045 --> 00:28:52,445
Speaker 2:  the retirement plan, man. Okay.

471
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,965
Speaker 2:  All right. We gotta take one more break and then we will be back with the

472
00:28:56,965 --> 00:28:58,885
Speaker 2:  rest of my conversation with David. Cogan

473
00:29:23,255 --> 00:29:27,065
Speaker 2:  Okay, we're back. Now we're kind of back to the present in our story.

474
00:29:27,315 --> 00:29:31,145
Speaker 2:  David just spent eight months creating a coffee shop from scratch while

475
00:29:31,195 --> 00:29:32,985
Speaker 2:  still kind of sort of maintaining

476
00:31:33,035 --> 00:31:36,595
Speaker 2:  mix of the two worlds every day. Is the context searching of that

477
00:31:36,975 --> 00:31:40,835
Speaker 2:  brutal? Yes. Are, are, are, are you gonna survive

478
00:31:40,835 --> 00:31:44,635
Speaker 2:  that? No. To be determined. Okay. No, it's been,

479
00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:47,195
Speaker 2:  it's, I've, I've been feeling pretty burnt out to be honest. But like, but

480
00:31:47,195 --> 00:31:51,075
Speaker 2:  there's something, it's a different burnout. Sure. Right. There's, there's,

481
00:31:51,345 --> 00:31:54,995
Speaker 2:  because, and I'm sure some of it's just, it's novel, right? The coffee shop

482
00:31:55,015 --> 00:31:58,195
Speaker 2:  is new. It is a different thing. It is very to what we already talked about.

483
00:31:58,195 --> 00:32:02,115
Speaker 2:  It's very different than the YouTube channel. And So, I enjoy it a lot, even

484
00:32:02,115 --> 00:32:04,755
Speaker 2:  if it's stressful and there's things going wrong and everything else. There's,

485
00:32:04,755 --> 00:32:08,395
Speaker 2:  there's something about it that is just so enjoyable that it kind of tempers

486
00:32:08,455 --> 00:32:11,955
Speaker 2:  the burnout from all the things that are happening. And I, and I can see

487
00:32:11,955 --> 00:32:15,155
Speaker 2:  a light at the end of the tunnel. I think, you know, I feel like there's,

488
00:32:15,365 --> 00:32:19,035
Speaker 2:  there is a world where this, where I, I'm here less and less.

489
00:32:19,555 --> 00:32:21,955
Speaker 2:  I can, you know, not have to worry about doing certain things. I'm trying

490
00:32:21,955 --> 00:32:23,955
Speaker 2:  to figure out inventory, for example. Right? Like, how do I make sure that

491
00:32:23,955 --> 00:32:26,875
Speaker 2:  the inventory I can project in a certain way that I don't have to order every

492
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:29,955
Speaker 2:  time things get low, obviously. Right. So it's a goal you have to get to

493
00:32:30,145 --> 00:32:33,835
Speaker 2:  getting there. So like, that's helpful. Is that the goal?

494
00:32:33,865 --> 00:32:37,365
Speaker 2:  Like, is the, is the goal to spend

495
00:32:37,635 --> 00:32:41,525
Speaker 2:  less time on this so you can go back to making videos? I,

496
00:32:41,595 --> 00:32:45,565
Speaker 2:  yeah. I, mm, questionable. I, I wanna do both. Okay. I enjoy both

497
00:32:45,665 --> 00:32:47,925
Speaker 2:  to some degree. I think I enjoy the coffee shop more than YouTube at this

498
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:49,885
Speaker 2:  point. But again, I think that's something to do with it being novel and

499
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,405
Speaker 2:  it's with your hands and everything. And I've been doing the other thing

500
00:32:51,405 --> 00:32:54,605
Speaker 2:  for 13 years, but I, you know,

501
00:32:55,555 --> 00:32:59,445
Speaker 2:  YouTube is still the thing I've been doing for however long. Right.

502
00:32:59,525 --> 00:33:03,165
Speaker 2:  I can't, it's also, I assume the business, it's like it's paying for everything.

503
00:33:03,365 --> 00:33:05,405
Speaker 2:  Absolutely. Yeah. This is just losing money. This is just a very expensive

504
00:33:05,405 --> 00:33:08,725
Speaker 2:  hobby. Sure. So yes, YouTube is paying the bills and it is, it is kind of

505
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:11,965
Speaker 2:  the thing that I've, I've built over all this time. I can't throw the baby

506
00:33:11,965 --> 00:33:14,965
Speaker 2:  out with the bath water fair. Not that I would, I still enjoy YouTube, but

507
00:33:14,965 --> 00:33:18,925
Speaker 2:  like, you know what I mean? So, I. I've now just, I'm trying to just

508
00:33:18,925 --> 00:33:22,285
Speaker 2:  get back to a, a better cadence of making the YouTube videos

509
00:33:22,855 --> 00:33:25,845
Speaker 2:  while still being involved in the coffee shop. Okay. And I think that's the

510
00:33:25,845 --> 00:33:28,925
Speaker 2:  goal. It's not necessarily like step completely away from the coffee shop

511
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:32,765
Speaker 2:  and then just run YouTube. Like I was, I think there, there's an

512
00:33:32,765 --> 00:33:36,725
Speaker 2:  element of like, if I could figure out more things to, to hand off in YouTube

513
00:33:36,785 --> 00:33:39,445
Speaker 2:  and make that a little more efficient, make the coffee shop more efficient.

514
00:33:39,445 --> 00:33:42,565
Speaker 2:  There's a, there's some, and maybe this isn't real, but there's some ideal

515
00:33:42,565 --> 00:33:46,245
Speaker 2:  world where I can kind of do both in a, in a healthy balance and still have

516
00:33:46,245 --> 00:33:48,525
Speaker 2:  a social life somehow. Then I'll figure that part out later because Yeah.

517
00:33:48,525 --> 00:33:52,245
Speaker 2:  Details, details. I think one of the things people burn out on YouTube

518
00:33:53,025 --> 00:33:56,885
Speaker 2:  and really kind of creator life in general is just that it asks so

519
00:33:56,885 --> 00:34:00,605
Speaker 2:  much of you in so many different directions all the time. Right. Like, I

520
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,605
Speaker 2:  hear from creators all the time who are like, I started making videos because

521
00:34:04,005 --> 00:34:07,165
Speaker 2:  I like making videos. They were fun. Either the thing in the video is fun

522
00:34:07,165 --> 00:34:10,845
Speaker 2:  or the process of making the video is fun or something. And then all of a

523
00:34:10,845 --> 00:34:13,245
Speaker 2:  sudden you're like, oh my God, I'm spending all my day essentially doing

524
00:34:13,245 --> 00:34:16,605
Speaker 2:  data analysis. Like, that's actually not a good time. Right. Right. And then,

525
00:34:16,665 --> 00:34:20,405
Speaker 2:  and then your option is either grind until it burns you out. Yep.

526
00:34:21,705 --> 00:34:25,565
Speaker 2:  Not worry about it so much and kind of limit your cap of success

527
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:28,685
Speaker 2:  on the platform. Sure. Or basically try to

528
00:34:28,955 --> 00:34:32,845
Speaker 2:  systematize. Right. And like hire people. Yep. Outsource some of that stuff.

529
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:35,565
Speaker 2:  Make it no longer your problem and you just get to do the parts of it that

530
00:34:35,565 --> 00:34:38,645
Speaker 2:  you like. Right. And, and sort of solve the rest around you. And it sounds

531
00:34:38,645 --> 00:34:42,165
Speaker 2:  like that's the thing you're aiming for. I, after a long time of just grinding.

532
00:34:42,715 --> 00:34:45,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I look, I So I think, I think there's a couple things there. Like the,

533
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:49,405
Speaker 2:  I think that is the goal. I would like it, but, but not quite. Right. Like

534
00:34:49,405 --> 00:34:52,685
Speaker 2:  I don't, I don't wanna be Marquez. Like, that's just never a goal for me.

535
00:34:52,685 --> 00:34:56,565
Speaker 2:  Sure. I don't want to have like, or a Linus or, you know, whoever else which

536
00:34:56,565 --> 00:34:59,405
Speaker 2:  are essentially media companies. Correct. I, that's never a goal. I don't

537
00:34:59,405 --> 00:35:01,565
Speaker 2:  wanna do that. That sounds like more stress for me than I want to be honest.

538
00:35:01,785 --> 00:35:04,725
Speaker 2:  But also like, I don't need to be that big. Right. I'm happy to like, you

539
00:35:04,725 --> 00:35:08,205
Speaker 2:  know, I I, I just want to, I think I need to let go of more things. And this

540
00:35:08,205 --> 00:35:11,405
Speaker 2:  coffee shop has proven is like, kind of forced me to do that. Not to the

541
00:35:11,405 --> 00:35:15,325
Speaker 2:  point where it's like, I come in and I talk on camera for more four seconds

542
00:35:15,345 --> 00:35:19,165
Speaker 2:  and I walk away and that's the end. I don't, and and also just the, just

543
00:35:19,165 --> 00:35:21,765
Speaker 2:  the nature of my videos, it's very difficult as well. Right. Because I, I

544
00:35:21,765 --> 00:35:24,805
Speaker 2:  enjoy having this, like, you're coming along with me very vlogger style.

545
00:35:24,805 --> 00:35:28,645
Speaker 2:  Yeah. As soon as there's a cameraman holding that camera, it gets a very

546
00:35:28,645 --> 00:35:31,485
Speaker 2:  different vibe, which I just don't want as a creative choice. I just don't

547
00:35:31,485 --> 00:35:34,325
Speaker 2:  like that. Maybe it'll happen one day 'cause I wanna have a choice, but like,

548
00:35:34,325 --> 00:35:37,565
Speaker 2:  sure. That's, you know, like, I kinda like bouncing around with, with the

549
00:35:37,765 --> 00:35:40,325
Speaker 2:  audience and like, kind of, and I even enjoy making those videos where like,

550
00:35:40,325 --> 00:35:43,445
Speaker 2:  it's literally me, like exploring places with you. I'm, I'm, a lot of these

551
00:35:43,445 --> 00:35:47,045
Speaker 2:  places are new to me too. So I. Don't think I'm gonna let that go. So there's

552
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:50,845
Speaker 2:  somewhere else that, that I think I can hand things off, but still

553
00:35:50,845 --> 00:35:54,765
Speaker 2:  be as involved as I can be without, you know, killing myself and

554
00:35:54,765 --> 00:35:58,645
Speaker 2:  going insane. But I do. But I also think, like creators in general, we

555
00:35:58,645 --> 00:36:02,605
Speaker 2:  have this issue too, which is the fact that like, in order to do what

556
00:36:02,605 --> 00:36:06,205
Speaker 2:  we do, especially YouTube or Instagram or whatever social media, you,

557
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:10,445
Speaker 2:  you have to make everything formulaic. Right.

558
00:36:10,745 --> 00:36:14,365
Speaker 2:  So in other words, like in order to churn out as many videos as I do, I have

559
00:36:14,365 --> 00:36:18,165
Speaker 2:  to make everything so like, fit into a

560
00:36:18,165 --> 00:36:20,605
Speaker 2:  box. Like, I'm gonna write the script, it's gonna be like this. Yeah. I'm

561
00:36:20,605 --> 00:36:23,885
Speaker 2:  gonna get this shot like this. I'm gonna do, there's no area for creativity

562
00:36:23,905 --> 00:36:27,645
Speaker 2:  at some point because the only way it'll get done is If. you make it as

563
00:36:27,845 --> 00:36:30,685
Speaker 2:  efficient as possible. Yep. And that is where I think we all start to burn

564
00:36:30,685 --> 00:36:34,045
Speaker 2:  out because then you're just like, I'm just a hamster on a wheel. Nothing

565
00:36:34,095 --> 00:36:38,005
Speaker 2:  feels gratifying at that point. It's just cool making a video, putting it

566
00:36:38,005 --> 00:36:40,685
Speaker 2:  out. Right. Especially around this time of year is even worse. But, but that's

567
00:36:40,685 --> 00:36:43,205
Speaker 2:  what the audience demands of you, right? Correct. Yeah. That's, that's the

568
00:36:43,445 --> 00:36:46,245
Speaker 2:  industry thing over and over and over and it over again. Yeah. That's what,

569
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,565
Speaker 2:  that's what the algorithm's like. Yep. That's what the audience expects.

570
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:52,165
Speaker 2:  And at some point it just becomes Yeah. Easier

571
00:36:53,225 --> 00:36:57,125
Speaker 2:  and way less fulfilling Totally. To just deliver the thing. Correct. Yeah.

572
00:36:57,125 --> 00:37:00,285
Speaker 2:  And, and like yeah. And you need to, you need to do the optimization in order

573
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:03,685
Speaker 2:  to be able to do it. Right. And the only way you can, you know, keep up with

574
00:37:03,685 --> 00:37:06,405
Speaker 2:  that cadence is to make things as smooth as possible, not as creative as

575
00:37:06,565 --> 00:37:09,485
Speaker 2:  possible. Has that, yeah. Like, that's not transferred to the coffee shop.

576
00:37:09,555 --> 00:37:13,245
Speaker 2:  Does it feel the same way? No. No, no. Which I think maybe

577
00:37:13,245 --> 00:37:16,365
Speaker 2:  that's another reason why I enjoy it so much. Like there's, there is a lot

578
00:37:16,365 --> 00:37:20,125
Speaker 2:  of, because we just opened, there's a lot of creating all these

579
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:23,045
Speaker 2:  processes and optimizing and I, I do enjoy a lot of that,

580
00:37:23,895 --> 00:37:27,685
Speaker 2:  which is interesting. I enjoy it in this respect more so than like, I think

581
00:37:27,765 --> 00:37:30,525
Speaker 2:  I enjoy trying to figure those things out with YouTube, but now that I've

582
00:37:30,525 --> 00:37:33,605
Speaker 2:  figured them out Right. They're just building systems is much more fun than

583
00:37:33,605 --> 00:37:35,725
Speaker 2:  living inside of them. Just living in them. Yeah. Correct. It's a hundred

584
00:37:35,725 --> 00:37:38,805
Speaker 2:  percent. Yeah. That's a good way to put it. Yeah. But yeah, so like I'm building

585
00:37:38,805 --> 00:37:41,205
Speaker 2:  those systems for the coffee shop and every day like I get feedback from

586
00:37:41,205 --> 00:37:43,525
Speaker 2:  the baristas or I'm behind the counter with them sometimes I'm like, I see,

587
00:37:43,525 --> 00:37:46,365
Speaker 2:  okay, there's a bottleneck. Like, let's figure that out. You know, Hey guys,

588
00:37:46,525 --> 00:37:50,165
Speaker 2:  what do you think? You know, what is a better setup for this? Like, is what's

589
00:37:50,165 --> 00:37:52,885
Speaker 2:  slowing you guys down? And like, that's fun. There's something I think hu

590
00:37:52,885 --> 00:37:55,965
Speaker 2:  as humans, we like to solve things, especially when they're small problems,

591
00:37:56,035 --> 00:37:59,725
Speaker 2:  like where the cups should go. Right. You know, like bigger problems.

592
00:37:59,965 --> 00:38:02,445
Speaker 2:  Terrible. Right. But like, you know, these kinds of things are like, they're,

593
00:38:02,445 --> 00:38:06,165
Speaker 2:  they're fulfilling. They give you like a, a nice, ah, I did that. I checked

594
00:38:06,165 --> 00:38:08,765
Speaker 2:  the box. Right. And so there's a lot of those right now in the coffee shop

595
00:38:08,795 --> 00:38:12,685
Speaker 2:  that are fun to do. So back to this like content coffee shop mix. I,

596
00:38:12,805 --> 00:38:16,565
Speaker 2:  I can now imagine a world in which you become a coffee

597
00:38:16,565 --> 00:38:20,365
Speaker 2:  content person. Mm. Like the, the roastery is gonna happen. Yep.

598
00:38:20,825 --> 00:38:24,685
Speaker 2:  You already do a lot of filming of cups of coffee. As someone

599
00:38:24,685 --> 00:38:26,885
Speaker 2:  who has watched your channel for a long time, I can, I can vouch for it.

600
00:38:26,885 --> 00:38:30,445
Speaker 2:  Appreciate that there are hours of videos of coffee Yes. Correct. Coffee

601
00:38:30,445 --> 00:38:33,285
Speaker 2:  cups on your channel. I don't even need to create new content. I can just

602
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:37,165
Speaker 2:  splice all that together. Boom. Exactly. It's a real, to reverse all the

603
00:38:37,245 --> 00:38:39,485
Speaker 2:  questions I asked you at the beginning, right. You're like, oh, now I have

604
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:43,445
Speaker 2:  a room full of coffee equipment. Maybe I should just point a camera at it.

605
00:38:43,445 --> 00:38:47,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. It, it occurs to me in, in, in the way a bad habit occurs to

606
00:38:47,585 --> 00:38:50,605
Speaker 2:  you. Right. Like, I sit there and I'm like, should film this that make some

607
00:38:50,605 --> 00:38:53,525
Speaker 2:  good content? Look at that. Yes. I think I always think that it's like a

608
00:38:53,525 --> 00:38:55,605
Speaker 2:  junky thing. It's legit. Like, how do I make this content legit? It is legit

609
00:38:55,605 --> 00:38:58,285
Speaker 2:  that it's like a and after a decade of YouTube Yeah. That's, you see the

610
00:38:58,285 --> 00:39:01,085
Speaker 2:  world as content opportunities. It's real. You're for better and worse. No,

611
00:39:01,085 --> 00:39:04,845
Speaker 2:  it's true, real. It's absolutely true. And So I have thought about it

612
00:39:06,145 --> 00:39:10,125
Speaker 2:  and I think IIII think there is a world where maybe more coffee

613
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:13,925
Speaker 2:  stuff ends up on the channel or the audience, you know, if they, if they

614
00:39:13,925 --> 00:39:17,045
Speaker 2:  want that, maybe I'll try it and let's just see how they feel about it would

615
00:39:17,045 --> 00:39:20,965
Speaker 2:  be the way to do it. I mean, I did of course grab all of the social things

616
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:24,685
Speaker 2:  for the coffee shop just preemptively because I was like, well, we're gonna

617
00:39:24,685 --> 00:39:27,245
Speaker 2:  have to start doing content here as well for sure. So I. I mean, I think,

618
00:39:27,825 --> 00:39:31,755
Speaker 2:  but that's different. So like, I think, I think in the

619
00:39:31,755 --> 00:39:35,435
Speaker 2:  world in which we exist, you are going to have to take pretty videos of your

620
00:39:35,595 --> 00:39:38,715
Speaker 2:  espresso machine and put them on Instagram occasionally. And I think to some

621
00:39:38,715 --> 00:39:40,995
Speaker 2:  extent, again, those things are symbiotic, right? Yeah. Like, it's, it's,

622
00:39:40,995 --> 00:39:43,435
Speaker 2:  they, it brings people into the shop. Yep. People watch the thing. People

623
00:39:43,435 --> 00:39:45,995
Speaker 2:  like the thing like it, that's all good. Yeah. But I also think it changes

624
00:39:46,015 --> 00:39:49,795
Speaker 2:  the way you think about the thing when it becomes most

625
00:39:50,075 --> 00:39:53,315
Speaker 2:  lucrative as a content opportunity. Right. And it would then become the thing

626
00:39:53,355 --> 00:39:57,115
Speaker 2:  I hate. Exactly. And So I think for you as someone who is like, who, who

627
00:39:57,115 --> 00:40:00,795
Speaker 2:  is in part this all appealed to Yeah. As a thing that is not

628
00:40:00,795 --> 00:40:04,475
Speaker 2:  content Yeah. To then have that pull of what if I make content about this?

629
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:08,075
Speaker 2:  Yes. And, and what if the content could help the coffee shop, but then eventually

630
00:40:08,195 --> 00:40:10,955
Speaker 2:  you get to a point where the coffee shop is just helping the content. Yeah.

631
00:40:10,985 --> 00:40:14,595
Speaker 2:  Like how to pick all those things apart in your brain. Just strikes me. It's

632
00:40:14,595 --> 00:40:18,275
Speaker 2:  very complicated. So So I think I've simplified it because

633
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:22,315
Speaker 2:  I'm just So I. So don't want that last part to happen. Okay. Right.

634
00:40:22,355 --> 00:40:25,835
Speaker 2:  I don't want the coffee shop to ever be making more money from the content

635
00:40:25,985 --> 00:40:29,555
Speaker 2:  than from the coffee shop. It, it becomes like a, a studio that happens to

636
00:40:29,555 --> 00:40:32,075
Speaker 2:  serve real coffee, which I don't want. Right. Because then, because then

637
00:40:32,075 --> 00:40:35,035
Speaker 2:  to the point, I would then just be doing the thing again that I'm sure. So

638
00:40:35,035 --> 00:40:38,355
Speaker 2:  like, I don't, I won't ever let that happen. And so that, like, in the same

639
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:41,275
Speaker 2:  way that like, I don't want the influencer part of this. Like, and I just

640
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:43,315
Speaker 2:  want to have one coffee shop. I don't wanna have more. Like I think these

641
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:47,235
Speaker 2:  are ways to limit that chaos that would normally happen in my

642
00:40:47,235 --> 00:40:50,835
Speaker 2:  head. Yeah. I've given myself this hard No, and,

643
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:54,355
Speaker 2:  and so like, I, I think we need to make content and we will, like right now

644
00:40:54,355 --> 00:40:56,955
Speaker 2:  we're posting photos and stuff and like whatever, I, I'm terrible at writing

645
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,155
Speaker 2:  captions. I just have too much, too much to do though is the other problem.

646
00:40:59,185 --> 00:41:03,075
Speaker 2:  Sure. Right. So in, if I was gonna try to make content in here and like

647
00:41:03,135 --> 00:41:06,595
Speaker 2:  try to get back to my own channel like that, it's just, I'm, I'm burnt out

648
00:41:06,595 --> 00:41:08,715
Speaker 2:  as it is, that's just gonna throw me over the edge. Yeah, that's right. So,

649
00:41:09,015 --> 00:41:12,275
Speaker 2:  but I do, I do like the idea of doing some sort of coffee content. Maybe

650
00:41:12,275 --> 00:41:14,795
Speaker 2:  when things start to settle and they start to get like, at least I get caught

651
00:41:14,795 --> 00:41:18,155
Speaker 2:  up on all the tech tober stuff that I need to get caught up on. Yeah. I just

652
00:41:18,155 --> 00:41:21,955
Speaker 2:  don't know actually in my head, if that's something that

653
00:41:21,955 --> 00:41:25,715
Speaker 2:  maybe lives on its own channel and is kind of just the Coffee Check

654
00:41:25,715 --> 00:41:29,315
Speaker 2:  channel and I host that maybe to some degree maybe someone else can host

655
00:41:29,315 --> 00:41:32,395
Speaker 2:  it, maybe I can set that up in a way where it's not just me, because then

656
00:41:32,395 --> 00:41:35,045
Speaker 2:  that would be more, be more scalable, easier for me to not have to be a part

657
00:41:35,045 --> 00:41:38,325
Speaker 2:  of all the time. Whereas like YouTube tick the locker, I'm not, I can't do

658
00:41:38,325 --> 00:41:40,245
Speaker 2:  that. Right. Right. If some other face showed up, it just would be a totally

659
00:41:40,245 --> 00:41:43,325
Speaker 2:  different trend. Yeah. I just, again, I want this to be a good coffee shop

660
00:41:43,405 --> 00:41:46,365
Speaker 2:  roastery, like known for the things that are, that are those things

661
00:41:47,185 --> 00:41:49,285
Speaker 2:  and not tied to an algorithm and other things like that.

662
00:41:51,195 --> 00:41:54,485
Speaker 2:  Alright. That is it for The Vergecast today. Thank you to David for being
