Description: It's a Nintendo Switch 2. What could it cost, a thousand dollars? In this episode, Nilay, David, and The Verge's Richard Lawler talk through why we don't really know. But first, we talk about the Switch 2, and some of the reasons we're excited — and maybe just a little concerned — about Nintendo's new console. This is likely to be the most interesting device of the year, and we learned an awful lot more about it this week. We also talk about Microsoft's 50th anniversary, the fate of TikTok, and other gadget news. Then we get to tariffs, with the help of Tuneshine creator Tobias Butler, who explains how tariffs affect the way hardware companies do business — and how they're navigating the current uncertainty. After that, in the lightning round, it's time for a little Brendan Carr is a Dummy, followed by the latest on Tesla's sales numbers, Alexa Plus, and Coyote vs. Acme.

00:01:40,075 --> 00:01:42,855
Speaker 5:  Hey everybody, it's Neli. Before we start the show, I just wanna say we were

Speaker 5:  nominated for a Webby award, which is very exciting. We would love to have

4
00:01:46,095 --> 00:01:49,375
Speaker 5:  you go vote for us. We'll put the link in the show notes. Once again, we'd

5
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,695
Speaker 5:  love to win this webby. We'd love your support. Go vote for us at the Webby

6
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:52,895
Speaker 5:  Awards.

7
00:01:55,225 --> 00:01:59,175
Speaker 5:  Hello and welcome to Vergecast, the flagship podcast of adding Greek letters

8
00:01:59,175 --> 00:02:02,015
Speaker 5:  that cancel each other out to an equation to make yourself look smart.

9
00:02:02,275 --> 00:02:02,935
Speaker 3:  Who among us,

10
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:06,135
Speaker 5:  We're very lucky in that we have an audience where you can make that joke

11
00:02:06,635 --> 00:02:10,415
Speaker 5:  and everyone got it and they, they got it on multiple levels.

12
00:02:10,605 --> 00:02:13,895
Speaker 5:  Like there's a realistic chance The Vergecast audience is like,

13
00:02:14,495 --> 00:02:17,215
Speaker 5:  I should make this equation more complicated. Like in your day-today lives,

14
00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:17,815
Speaker 5:  it's

15
00:02:17,815 --> 00:02:20,535
Speaker 6:  Like the, the thing where it's like, did you ever have those math problems

16
00:02:20,535 --> 00:02:23,495
Speaker 6:  where you just sort of, in your brain, you just like, know the answer, but

17
00:02:23,495 --> 00:02:25,415
Speaker 6:  then it's like, show your work and I'm, you're just like, I'm gonna just

18
00:02:25,415 --> 00:02:28,095
Speaker 6:  make up a bunch of things that happen between here and there.

19
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:31,575
Speaker 5:  It's six. All right. I know it's six. I'm not gonna tell you why. I know

20
00:02:31,605 --> 00:02:32,455
Speaker 5:  it's six. It's

21
00:02:32,455 --> 00:02:35,815
Speaker 6:  Six. Yeah, it's not important. Why? It's six, but it's six. Leave me alone.

22
00:02:36,075 --> 00:02:39,735
Speaker 5:  And the answer is, crash the world economy. Alright, I'm your friend Neli.

23
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:43,415
Speaker 5:  David Pierce is here. Richard Lawler's here. Hey, good to be here. Welcome

Speaker 5:  on this week. David keeps mumbling. We have too much show. We have a lot

26
00:02:51,335 --> 00:02:54,815
Speaker 5:  of show. We're gonna talk about tariffs. We're actually, we've invited Tobias

27
00:02:54,855 --> 00:02:58,815
Speaker 5:  s Butler who is the, the, the, the sole proprietor of a gadget maker

28
00:02:58,815 --> 00:03:01,405
Speaker 5:  called Tuneshine, which I love, we've talked about in the show before. I

29
00:03:01,405 --> 00:03:05,325
Speaker 5:  wanted to bring someone on to talk about the real impact of tariffs. So

30
00:03:05,325 --> 00:03:08,445
Speaker 5:  we invited somebody who makes hardware, really cool hardware that I love

31
00:03:08,545 --> 00:03:10,845
Speaker 5:  to talk about. What's gonna happen to his business. That's gonna be fun.

32
00:03:10,895 --> 00:03:13,605
Speaker 5:  We've got a lightning round. We've got a podcast for a podcast that people

33
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:17,165
Speaker 5:  love. It's Microsoft's 50th birthday, which there's a lot going on there.

34
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:17,725
Speaker 5:  That's

35
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:20,205
Speaker 6:  What I'm saying. We have too much show. Like if everybody could just stop.

36
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:24,045
Speaker 5:  David. David, The Nintendo Switch two is also out this week.

37
00:03:25,385 --> 00:03:29,325
Speaker 5:  And then on top of that, sometime this weekend, TikTok is

38
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:33,245
Speaker 5:  gonna get banned again or sold directly to Jeff Bezos, which he will operate

39
00:03:33,435 --> 00:03:34,965
Speaker 5:  then from his yacht. Do

40
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:38,845
Speaker 6:  You know how long ago the switch to announcement feels to me right now as

41
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:42,525
Speaker 6:  we're sitting here? It was, it was 28 hours ago,

42
00:03:42,635 --> 00:03:46,285
Speaker 6:  give or take. And I, you could convince me it, it was like in January at

43
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:46,565
Speaker 6:  this point,

44
00:03:46,945 --> 00:03:50,125
Speaker 5:  On top of all of that, we're gonna do a full hour on the fact that I once

45
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:53,725
Speaker 5:  again recommended brother printers to the internet. And what that says about

46
00:03:53,725 --> 00:03:57,245
Speaker 5:  the state of the media ecosystem we out with. So buckle up

47
00:03:57,635 --> 00:04:01,405
Speaker 5:  five hour verse. Yes. We should start with Microsoft because

48
00:04:01,465 --> 00:04:04,485
Speaker 5:  on the day this this show comes out April 4th,

49
00:04:05,365 --> 00:04:09,225
Speaker 5:  Microsoft will turn 50 years old, which makes me

50
00:04:09,225 --> 00:04:10,465
Speaker 5:  feel like an ancient wizard.

51
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,795
Speaker 5:  That is just an old, old number.

52
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,195
Speaker 6:  You were, you were just graduating from college when Microsoft started, right?

53
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:18,635
Speaker 6:  Is

54
00:04:18,635 --> 00:04:21,075
Speaker 5:  That I, I sat Bill Gates down. I was like, listen

55
00:04:21,075 --> 00:04:21,835
Speaker 6:  Here, young pup.

56
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:25,915
Speaker 5:  No, it's, it's incredible. Microsoft is one of those companies that we, we

57
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:30,035
Speaker 5:  once covered as sort of an upstart, a challenger. Now It is an

58
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:33,955
Speaker 5:  institution. It It is the infrastructure that all the other

59
00:04:34,195 --> 00:04:37,395
Speaker 5:  companies run on with Azure. We, we covered the bomber era.

60
00:04:38,055 --> 00:04:41,595
Speaker 5:  The Verge started like with Windows phone,

61
00:04:42,275 --> 00:04:45,685
Speaker 5:  like the idea that Windows phone would be a meaningful competitor provided

62
00:04:45,705 --> 00:04:49,245
Speaker 5:  us an awful lot of traffic in our, including some of our,

63
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:53,475
Speaker 5:  our most contentious reviews of all time. When

64
00:04:53,475 --> 00:04:57,315
Speaker 5:  we would write, Hey, this Windows phone is not very good. Oh yeah, boy,

65
00:04:57,315 --> 00:04:58,115
Speaker 5:  people had feelings.

66
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:01,755
Speaker 6:  The Lumia comments were like, nothing I've ever seen on Yeah.

67
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:05,075
Speaker 5:  Tech message for a long time. It was the most comments we ever got was on

68
00:05:05,075 --> 00:05:07,435
Speaker 5:  a review of the like Lumia 900 or something.

69
00:05:09,255 --> 00:05:13,125
Speaker 5:  They're gone now. We switch commenting platforms. So you can't, and

70
00:05:13,285 --> 00:05:15,845
Speaker 5:  I think that's good. I think that it's probably for the best that you can't

71
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:19,285
Speaker 5:  go back and read this like everyone, you know that right to be forgotten.

72
00:05:19,605 --> 00:05:22,325
Speaker 5:  Everyone can just forget that one. But here's what I wanna do in honor of

73
00:05:22,325 --> 00:05:25,525
Speaker 5:  the birthday. We don't wanna go too far into, into the history of Microsoft.

74
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:29,405
Speaker 5:  We published a list of the 50 best consumer products Microsoft

75
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:33,315
Speaker 5:  has ever made. I think most people think we got it right. There's

76
00:05:33,315 --> 00:05:36,795
Speaker 5:  not a lot of, there's not as much heat as you would expect. There are some

77
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:40,715
Speaker 5:  people who vehemently disagree with our ordering. Yes. But the stuff on

78
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,595
Speaker 5:  the list, I think everyone agrees is the right stuff.

79
00:05:43,395 --> 00:05:46,555
Speaker 6:  I was sort of impressed that we managed to get to 50 and I look at most of

80
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:50,235
Speaker 6:  these 50 and I'm like, eh, sure. It's pretty good. There's only a few that

81
00:05:50,255 --> 00:05:53,435
Speaker 6:  I'm like, I don't know that this belongs on any best of list of anything.

82
00:05:53,935 --> 00:05:57,685
Speaker 6:  But for the most part it's, it's Microsoft has a better run at this than

83
00:05:57,685 --> 00:05:58,285
Speaker 6:  I anticipated.

84
00:05:58,685 --> 00:06:02,245
Speaker 5:  Honestly, I was talking to Jake who made this list with Tom and he was like,

85
00:06:02,355 --> 00:06:05,205
Speaker 5:  look, you know, lists are there to be argued about

86
00:06:07,355 --> 00:06:10,405
Speaker 5:  because I was like, I wanna add more stuff. Like put this in an honor roll

87
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:11,845
Speaker 5:  mention category. And he was like, Wendell's m

88
00:06:12,145 --> 00:06:14,125
Speaker 7:  I'm just, I'm gonna say it. Wendell's Media sent. Yeah,

89
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:14,965
Speaker 5:  I'm just gonna

90
00:06:15,115 --> 00:06:17,045
Speaker 7:  Yelling the thing. Alright, so here's the thing. Keep yelling into the boy.

91
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:21,565
Speaker 5:  Richard and I were there during the Windows Media Center days when we were

92
00:06:21,565 --> 00:06:25,365
Speaker 5:  at Eng Gadget together. Microsoft would ship you a PC with a cable

93
00:06:25,435 --> 00:06:29,245
Speaker 5:  card decoder in it. There are people listening to this show, young people

94
00:06:29,545 --> 00:06:33,125
Speaker 5:  who do not understand that Microsoft thought it could turn a Windows

95
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:37,405
Speaker 5:  PC into a cable box using middleware and hardware developed by a

96
00:06:37,405 --> 00:06:40,725
Speaker 5:  consortium of cable companies that were forced to do it by the United States

97
00:06:40,725 --> 00:06:43,805
Speaker 5:  government. And they thought that this would work

98
00:06:45,145 --> 00:06:48,355
Speaker 5:  like a lot. They super thought this would work for years.

99
00:06:49,215 --> 00:06:52,795
Speaker 7:  We spent a lot of time on that. We all invested a lot of time

100
00:06:53,025 --> 00:06:53,715
Speaker 7:  into that idea.

101
00:06:54,175 --> 00:06:57,635
Speaker 5:  You would call the cable company and be like, I need this code to activate

102
00:06:57,675 --> 00:07:01,555
Speaker 5:  a cable card in my pc. And they would just be like, no, no, we're not

103
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:02,115
Speaker 5:  gonna do that.

104
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:07,075
Speaker 6:  There is something to be said for Microsoft, just

105
00:07:07,075 --> 00:07:10,795
Speaker 6:  has a series of ideas that it just keeps doing over and over.

106
00:07:11,175 --> 00:07:15,055
Speaker 6:  And one of its ideas is television and that's,

107
00:07:15,055 --> 00:07:18,455
Speaker 6:  yeah. As far as that idea ever goes at Microsoft it seems, but they're just

108
00:07:18,455 --> 00:07:22,415
Speaker 5:  Like, the only reason television, we talk about CS every year is

109
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:26,575
Speaker 5:  for years Bill Gates would show up in Las Vegas and give a

110
00:07:26,575 --> 00:07:29,775
Speaker 5:  speech where he'd be like, here's what I'm gonna do. I'm put a PC in the

111
00:07:30,055 --> 00:07:33,255
Speaker 5:  living room. Yeah. And this idea is called convergence

112
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:37,815
Speaker 5:  and then soon there will be a PC in your living room for

113
00:07:37,815 --> 00:07:41,525
Speaker 5:  like a decade. And then he was like, what if it was an Xbox?

114
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:45,285
Speaker 5:  And he was like, what if the Xbox was a cable box? What if the Xbox had IR

115
00:07:45,285 --> 00:07:48,565
Speaker 5:  blasters and that didn't work? And eventually we got to, what if

116
00:07:49,145 --> 00:07:53,045
Speaker 5:  we put basically a, a raspberry pie in your living room and

117
00:07:53,045 --> 00:07:56,085
Speaker 5:  it ran Roku software and everyone's like, oh, that was way better than a

118
00:07:56,085 --> 00:07:59,645
Speaker 5:  full on pc. But this is real. It drove the tech industry for years.

119
00:08:01,185 --> 00:08:05,045
Speaker 5:  And Richard and I had to cover it. Richard former, the editor of Eng Gadget

120
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:08,845
Speaker 5:  hd. Yes. An entire subsection of Eng Gadget that we, we created

121
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:12,445
Speaker 5:  because Microsoft was like, what if we put a pc?

122
00:08:13,985 --> 00:08:17,165
Speaker 5:  So Richard, I told you, you had to, you had to pick from this list.

123
00:08:17,895 --> 00:08:21,545
Speaker 5:  Your favorite Microsoft product not is you can't pick media center.

124
00:08:22,165 --> 00:08:24,105
Speaker 5:  That's, that's you doing honorable mention. See

125
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:27,985
Speaker 7:  That's how the media, the does the censorship that that's what's

126
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:31,865
Speaker 7:  going on. So I, I'll turn it back on you and I will include

127
00:08:32,185 --> 00:08:35,265
Speaker 7:  Microsoft's most successful effort at bringing a PC into the living room.

128
00:08:35,365 --> 00:08:36,385
Speaker 7:  The Xbox 360.

129
00:08:37,355 --> 00:08:38,095
Speaker 5:  Oh the

130
00:08:38,095 --> 00:08:41,855
Speaker 7:  Time that almost kind of worked because Netflix happened. HD DVD

131
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:45,735
Speaker 7:  Drive did not so much work, but the Netflix app came out on the Xbox

132
00:08:45,855 --> 00:08:49,695
Speaker 7:  360, very wildly successful. And that whole red

133
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,815
Speaker 7:  Ring of death thing and all the Xbox that they had to take back and fix,

134
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:54,255
Speaker 7:  we're just not gonna talk about that.

135
00:08:55,185 --> 00:08:58,355
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Set that aside. HGDB and the Red Ring of death. You set that aside.

136
00:08:58,355 --> 00:09:02,315
Speaker 5:  360 was great. 360, also notable because it was

137
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:05,835
Speaker 5:  a skunkworks project inside of Microsoft under an executive named Jay Allard

138
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:10,195
Speaker 5:  who was given special permission to not use Windows or Intel

139
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:14,065
Speaker 5:  chips. So it was a custom operating system on custom

140
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:16,065
Speaker 5:  chips. And that's why it was good.

141
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:17,245
Speaker 6:  Wow.

142
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:18,805
Speaker 5:  This is a true story. And

143
00:09:18,805 --> 00:09:22,045
Speaker 6:  No one at Microsoft went, oh, if you need special permission to do this,

144
00:09:23,115 --> 00:09:26,545
Speaker 6:  we might have other bigger problems. Like that's no,

145
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:29,105
Speaker 5:  You know, I think many people at Microsoft did that

146
00:09:29,455 --> 00:09:29,985
Speaker 6:  Well. Sure.

147
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:35,545
Speaker 5:  And then they, they they got rid of their CEO and they

148
00:09:35,545 --> 00:09:39,465
Speaker 5:  got a new CEO who solved a bunch of problems. Yeah. That was also

149
00:09:39,465 --> 00:09:43,385
Speaker 5:  where they got, remember the courier concept that's on this list? It was,

150
00:09:43,385 --> 00:09:47,025
Speaker 5:  it was a concept video. I don't even think they ever made a project. I don't

151
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:50,345
Speaker 5:  think they ever made it a product that was just a big book. Like you could

152
00:09:50,345 --> 00:09:53,465
Speaker 5:  open like a notebook and write in it and it was a tablet and associated iPad

153
00:09:53,465 --> 00:09:57,315
Speaker 5:  killer. Also Jay Allard saying, what if I didn't have to use Windows? And

154
00:09:57,315 --> 00:10:01,235
Speaker 5:  that was a bridge too far. My friends, they had been burned by putting windows

155
00:10:01,255 --> 00:10:05,155
Speaker 5:  in the living room so many times they let him do the Xbox 360. But

156
00:10:05,155 --> 00:10:08,875
Speaker 5:  when he was like, what if I made an iPad that was good out of not windows,

157
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,675
Speaker 5:  they're like, death to you sir. And that was the end of that.

158
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:15,385
Speaker 5:  Alright David, what's your story?

159
00:10:15,845 --> 00:10:19,675
Speaker 6:  So I did not expect to feel

160
00:10:19,695 --> 00:10:23,515
Speaker 6:  the feelings that I felt about this particular one, but the, the

161
00:10:23,515 --> 00:10:26,995
Speaker 6:  one on this list that I most went, ah, as soon as I saw it was the surface

162
00:10:26,995 --> 00:10:29,875
Speaker 6:  headphones. Ooh, did y'all ever have the surface headphones?

163
00:10:30,215 --> 00:10:31,995
Speaker 5:  No. No. But they had the wheel, right? That's 22.

164
00:10:32,185 --> 00:10:35,435
Speaker 6:  They had the wheel. So they, they sounded like fine. But they had

165
00:10:35,795 --> 00:10:38,755
Speaker 6:  unbelievable battery life when unbelievable battery life in

166
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:43,355
Speaker 6:  like a set of wireless noise canceling headphones was not a

167
00:10:43,355 --> 00:10:46,755
Speaker 6:  guarantee. And they had the dials. One side was

168
00:10:47,215 --> 00:10:50,995
Speaker 6:  for volume and one side was to dial up and down

169
00:10:51,155 --> 00:10:54,915
Speaker 6:  transparency basically. So you could like, you could, you could change how

170
00:10:54,915 --> 00:10:58,795
Speaker 6:  much of the world you could hear and how much you could just be sort

171
00:10:58,795 --> 00:11:02,635
Speaker 6:  of ensconced in noise cancellation. And still to this day, that is

172
00:11:02,635 --> 00:11:05,835
Speaker 6:  by a mile the best interface on a pair of headphones I've ever seen. Everybody

173
00:11:05,835 --> 00:11:09,395
Speaker 6:  else is like weird buttons on the side that you can't find.

174
00:11:09,615 --> 00:11:13,315
Speaker 6:  Or they do the Sony Touch stuff. That's just a nightmare.

175
00:11:13,505 --> 00:11:17,275
Speaker 6:  Like Microsoft just did it right the first time and I think they

176
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:21,115
Speaker 6:  made two pairs of the surface headphones if memory serves and then just

177
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:24,635
Speaker 6:  stopped. 'cause that's what Microsoft does. Why keep doing our good things

178
00:11:24,865 --> 00:11:28,235
Speaker 6:  when we can make more windows. But I loved those headphones. I still have,

179
00:11:28,595 --> 00:11:30,955
Speaker 6:  I still have a pair around here somewhere. I'm sure they don't work anymore.

180
00:11:31,015 --> 00:11:34,635
Speaker 6:  But like, I used those for a really long time because they were super

181
00:11:34,635 --> 00:11:38,435
Speaker 6:  comfortable and just being able to like walk around or be on a plane or whatever

182
00:11:38,435 --> 00:11:42,155
Speaker 6:  and just sort of spin it back, talk to somebody, spin it forward. Amazing.

183
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,315
Speaker 6:  I loved those headphones.

184
00:11:43,315 --> 00:11:47,075
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You know, well they died is 'cause Microsoft failed to make a mobile

185
00:11:47,075 --> 00:11:50,555
Speaker 5:  phone and the entire headphone industry requires you to own a phone in order

186
00:11:50,555 --> 00:11:51,715
Speaker 5:  to make a successful pair of

187
00:11:51,715 --> 00:11:52,715
Speaker 6:  Headphones, whatever.

188
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:54,445
Speaker 5:  I'm just saying,

189
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:55,485
Speaker 6:  I mean there is that,

190
00:11:55,485 --> 00:11:56,765
Speaker 5:  That's, that's your answer. Yeah.

191
00:11:56,975 --> 00:11:57,485
Speaker 6:  There are a

192
00:11:57,485 --> 00:12:00,045
Speaker 5:  Lot of, I know there's gonna be some people who tell me that Sony and Bose

193
00:12:00,045 --> 00:12:03,365
Speaker 5:  are doing fine, but there's, that's just because Apple keeps forgetting to

194
00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:04,365
Speaker 5:  rev the AirPods Max.

195
00:12:05,915 --> 00:12:09,045
Speaker 5:  This is real. And also the AirPods Max are heavy anyway, the service headphones

196
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:12,925
Speaker 5:  legitimately good. Love a wheel. Very Microsoft to be like, what if

197
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:16,765
Speaker 5:  there was a mechanical moving part on these headphones

198
00:12:17,485 --> 00:12:18,215
Speaker 5:  that we gave up?

199
00:12:18,235 --> 00:12:21,215
Speaker 6:  If they had just put a cable card in your headphones, everything would've

200
00:12:21,215 --> 00:12:21,335
Speaker 6:  been

201
00:12:21,885 --> 00:12:24,615
Speaker 5:  Fine. Okay, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna pick two.

202
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:29,045
Speaker 5:  They're kind of like both odd. You can pick two mentions. They're both on

203
00:12:29,045 --> 00:12:30,805
Speaker 5:  the list, they're just low on the list. Wait,

204
00:12:31,105 --> 00:12:33,445
Speaker 6:  I'm sorry. So Richard can't cheat. Richard

205
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:37,165
Speaker 5:  Did cheat. He provoked an entire conversation about cable card,

206
00:12:37,415 --> 00:12:40,645
Speaker 5:  which made it happen, which admittedly is very easy to do on this show.

207
00:12:41,355 --> 00:12:44,645
Speaker 6:  Richard. We're doing tariffs on Meli. This is happening.

208
00:12:45,205 --> 00:12:47,645
Speaker 5:  So I'm just gonna pick the one that I think everybody expects me to pick,

209
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:51,085
Speaker 5:  which is the Zune, the Ill faded, but Beloved

210
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:54,525
Speaker 5:  Zune a product that gave us the word squirkle,

211
00:12:55,205 --> 00:12:58,145
Speaker 5:  the real thing, a product which boldly asked the question,

212
00:12:59,015 --> 00:13:00,105
Speaker 5:  what if this was Brown?

213
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:06,085
Speaker 5:  It's true. Those are their ideas. Let's, let's make it brown. And

214
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:09,965
Speaker 5:  instead of a click wheel, have a Squirkle, not great, but

215
00:13:09,965 --> 00:13:13,445
Speaker 5:  introduced what the design language that would become metro, which is now

216
00:13:13,445 --> 00:13:17,405
Speaker 5:  everything. And I still to this day have a

217
00:13:17,405 --> 00:13:21,245
Speaker 5:  limited edition, one of 5,000 Joy Division Zune,

218
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:25,555
Speaker 5:  which is, it comes in a giant box that you know has the

219
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:29,475
Speaker 5:  Unknown pleasures art on it. It has every Joy division song on it. And

220
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:33,355
Speaker 5:  every now and again, I I open the box when you open it. They, they had Peter

221
00:13:33,715 --> 00:13:37,635
Speaker 5:  SSL design, the box joy, division orders designer. So you open it

222
00:13:37,975 --> 00:13:41,915
Speaker 5:  and it like lifts up. It's not elegant. It's like a big cardboard

223
00:13:41,975 --> 00:13:45,075
Speaker 5:  box and like a bunch of, now it's old, like a bunch of brittle cardboard.

224
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:48,555
Speaker 5:  It is like creeks at you, but it like lifts up and you can like look at a

225
00:13:48,555 --> 00:13:52,475
Speaker 5:  joy division in, and then you close it and you put it away until someone

226
00:13:52,505 --> 00:13:55,595
Speaker 5:  puts Zoom on a list of 50 Microsoft products. And you remember the fact that

227
00:13:55,595 --> 00:13:56,635
Speaker 5:  you paid too much money for this thing.

228
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,755
Speaker 6:  Is that one of those things that you like kept in the box because you were

229
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,755
Speaker 6:  like, someday when Joy Division is the biggest band in the world, this is

230
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:03,675
Speaker 6:  gonna be worth something.

231
00:14:04,175 --> 00:14:07,155
Speaker 5:  One day my daughter will come home wearing this t-shirt and I'll be like,

232
00:14:07,155 --> 00:14:10,065
Speaker 5:  you know, I have a Joy Division Zoom.

233
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:14,505
Speaker 5:  Have you ever listened to, I mean one of these songs and Lady

234
00:14:15,205 --> 00:14:18,465
Speaker 6:  That's Yeah. Your, your Heine cube was sewing for like thousands of dollars

235
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,505
Speaker 6:  on eBay. So, you know, wait it out, it could happen. That's

236
00:14:20,505 --> 00:14:23,545
Speaker 5:  True. Although I will never, the Heineke is like in the Vox Media office,

237
00:14:23,725 --> 00:14:26,745
Speaker 5:  by the way, once again, thank you my friend Gabe, who I effectively stole

238
00:14:26,745 --> 00:14:30,465
Speaker 5:  this back from. It's, it's there, it's fine. It's there. The Joy Division

239
00:14:30,465 --> 00:14:33,705
Speaker 5:  student lives in its box in my closet. It's never, that's very precious to

240
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:37,545
Speaker 5:  me. Okay. So that's the, the main thing. But the one I I

241
00:14:37,825 --> 00:14:41,665
Speaker 5:  insisted beyond this list is Microsoft Word 5.1

242
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:45,185
Speaker 5:  for the Mac, which was such a good word,

243
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:48,945
Speaker 5:  processor, that when it was replaced by Word six, which sucked, people

244
00:14:48,975 --> 00:14:52,845
Speaker 5:  kept using it for one full decade. They were like, Nope,

245
00:14:52,985 --> 00:14:56,085
Speaker 5:  I'm not upgrading to Word six. I'm not going to word

246
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,965
Speaker 5:  2001 for Mac. All the ones, there was a, this weird period where

247
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:04,085
Speaker 5:  Microsoft, the, the years that they revved the Mac software

248
00:15:04,085 --> 00:15:07,485
Speaker 5:  were different than the years they revved the Windows software. So you'd

249
00:15:07,485 --> 00:15:10,685
Speaker 5:  have Word 2000 and then the Mac would be like Ward 2001.

250
00:15:11,365 --> 00:15:15,215
Speaker 5:  This made no sense to anyone, but people just kept using Word 5.1 for a decade.

251
00:15:15,575 --> 00:15:17,935
Speaker 5:  I encourage you to look at the screenshot. It is archaic. It's in black and

252
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:21,535
Speaker 5:  white. It was a perfect piece of software, like a

253
00:15:21,535 --> 00:15:23,415
Speaker 5:  legitimately perfect piece of software.

254
00:15:24,205 --> 00:15:26,685
Speaker 6:  I was just gonna bring up the screenshot because it, it's actually like,

255
00:15:26,705 --> 00:15:29,285
Speaker 6:  if, if you haven't looked at it, and again, I encourage you to, we'll put

256
00:15:29,285 --> 00:15:33,205
Speaker 6:  it in the show notes. If you were to draw a cartoon making

257
00:15:33,345 --> 00:15:36,885
Speaker 6:  fun of how ridiculous word looks with like

258
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:40,965
Speaker 6:  billions of buttons and every there there's like 14 scroll

259
00:15:40,965 --> 00:15:44,885
Speaker 6:  bars here and all of It is completely inscrutable. And then there's

260
00:15:44,885 --> 00:15:48,365
Speaker 6:  like three lines of text. Like if you wanted to make fun of the design of

261
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:48,805
Speaker 6:  work, this

262
00:15:48,805 --> 00:15:51,365
Speaker 5:  Is perfect. Is what one of those buttons, if you look at every one of those

263
00:15:51,365 --> 00:15:53,885
Speaker 5:  buttons, you know exactly what they do and they're right in front of you.

264
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:57,405
Speaker 5:  And there's not a single bit of wasted or hidden

265
00:15:57,405 --> 00:15:57,885
Speaker 5:  interface.

266
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:02,245
Speaker 6:  There are five things here that you could convince me all make the space

267
00:16:02,245 --> 00:16:03,685
Speaker 6:  bigger between lines. No, but

268
00:16:03,685 --> 00:16:06,085
Speaker 5:  They do in different and meaningful ways.

269
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:12,795
Speaker 5:  I'm telling you also, you click the buttons and then the thing happens and

270
00:16:12,795 --> 00:16:15,075
Speaker 5:  then you, you click the button right next to it that does the other thing.

271
00:16:15,755 --> 00:16:19,625
Speaker 5:  This is why it's perfect software because everything happens. See, I gotta,

272
00:16:19,665 --> 00:16:22,225
Speaker 7:  I gotta disagree with you there man. We, we have to embrace debate on this

273
00:16:22,225 --> 00:16:25,665
Speaker 7:  show. We gotta go in that direction. How, how can you go Word

274
00:16:25,665 --> 00:16:27,625
Speaker 7:  5.1 and not Microsoft Excel?

275
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,145
Speaker 5:  Ooh, I think Excel's gotta be on this list. But like as a concept,

276
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:34,225
Speaker 5:  not as a individual version. No,

277
00:16:34,505 --> 00:16:36,305
Speaker 7:  No, not not actually using it. Just the idea.

278
00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:38,185
Speaker 5:  It

279
00:16:38,185 --> 00:16:42,145
Speaker 6:  Is the idea of Excel. I Excel is not on this list. And I think the fact that

280
00:16:42,165 --> 00:16:46,145
Speaker 6:  we put Clippy at 50 and Bob at 49

281
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,905
Speaker 6:  and did not put Excel on is a statement. I'm very glad that we made, I

282
00:16:49,905 --> 00:16:52,145
Speaker 5:  Don't think anyone noticed Excel's on the list. All right, we gotta, that's

283
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,265
Speaker 5:  the show everybody. We gotta go

284
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,225
Speaker 5:  in Incre. I guess Excel technically is business software, not consumer software.

285
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:03,335
Speaker 5:  That's my argument for you. Sure. All right. That's Microsoft. Go read the

286
00:17:03,335 --> 00:17:06,215
Speaker 5:  list, let us know what you think we got right or wrong or what you put on

287
00:17:06,215 --> 00:17:09,695
Speaker 5:  the list. Congratulations to Microsoft for inching Ever closer

288
00:17:10,315 --> 00:17:14,095
Speaker 5:  to Oblivion. Can you tell, I'm thinking about aging. That's what's happening.

289
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:18,175
Speaker 5:  But congratulations to Microsoft. We, we, we presumably they'll be around

290
00:17:18,195 --> 00:17:20,815
Speaker 5:  for another 50 years because they make software, not hardware. And I don't

291
00:17:20,815 --> 00:17:23,895
Speaker 5:  know if the tariffs will apply to them. All right. Let's talk about the Switch

292
00:17:23,895 --> 00:17:27,335
Speaker 5:  two for a minute. I think Ash is gonna be on the show. Ash Paris is gonna

293
00:17:27,335 --> 00:17:30,735
Speaker 5:  be on the show real soon to go in depth. She's actually played with it. She's

294
00:17:30,735 --> 00:17:33,255
Speaker 5:  got a number of hands-on impressions. You should watch her YouTube video,

295
00:17:33,915 --> 00:17:35,855
Speaker 5:  but we should still talk about it. David, what's going on with Switch two?

296
00:17:35,965 --> 00:17:39,415
Speaker 6:  Yeah, first of all, Ash, the, the YouTube commenters

297
00:17:40,005 --> 00:17:43,775
Speaker 6:  have been loving ash these last 24 hours and it's

298
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:47,575
Speaker 6:  delightful and highly recommend watching. She did a social video and a

299
00:17:47,575 --> 00:17:50,885
Speaker 6:  YouTube video. They're both very good. She and Andrew Webster have both used

300
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:54,845
Speaker 6:  the thing and both came away from it, I think like, pretty excited. They,

301
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:58,165
Speaker 6:  it's, we finally have details on the thing that we wanted

302
00:17:58,565 --> 00:18:02,525
Speaker 6:  Nintendo to make, which is just a switch, but better. So there was a, there

303
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:06,085
Speaker 6:  was a direct this week, which is what Nintendo calls, it's like

304
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:10,045
Speaker 6:  periodic product announcements. And we got a bunch of

305
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:13,565
Speaker 6:  new specs. We got a release date. The thing's coming out on June 5th,

306
00:18:13,915 --> 00:18:17,645
Speaker 6:  it's gonna cost $450, which made a lot of people feel a lot of feelings.

307
00:18:17,645 --> 00:18:20,445
Speaker 6:  And we should talk about that for now, but

308
00:18:20,445 --> 00:18:22,085
Speaker 7:  Well, it's gonna cost $500. Yeah,

309
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:24,205
Speaker 6:  $630.

310
00:18:27,235 --> 00:18:30,285
Speaker 6:  Give it time. By the time it ships it'll be $11,000.

311
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:33,525
Speaker 7:  Well you, you're going to buy the Mario Kart bundle version, right? You have

312
00:18:33,525 --> 00:18:35,925
Speaker 7:  like, you're not going to buy this and not get Mario Kart. That's true.

313
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:40,495
Speaker 6:  Especially 'cause Mario Kart on its own is $80. But anyway, Richard,

314
00:18:40,635 --> 00:18:42,815
Speaker 6:  I'm gonna, I'm gonna list all the specs I can remember off the top of my

315
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:46,495
Speaker 6:  head and you're gonna fill in the rest. Ready. Okay. So big changes. It is,

316
00:18:46,595 --> 00:18:50,495
Speaker 6:  it has a 7.9 inch screen, which is substantially bigger than before.

317
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:54,815
Speaker 6:  The, the thing is the same thickness as the previous switch, which is

318
00:18:54,815 --> 00:18:58,255
Speaker 6:  nice, but It is like noticeably physically larger

319
00:18:59,395 --> 00:19:03,215
Speaker 6:  10 80 p screen, not oled, which again made people feel feelings, but

320
00:19:03,455 --> 00:19:07,055
Speaker 6:  there will inevitably be a switch to ole at some point in the future. That's

321
00:19:07,055 --> 00:19:09,615
Speaker 6:  what Nintendo did with the switch. I'm sure it'll happen again.

322
00:19:10,915 --> 00:19:14,535
Speaker 6:  New joycons that attach magnetically instead of the kind of wacky

323
00:19:14,535 --> 00:19:16,255
Speaker 6:  sliding mechanism that they've had before.

324
00:19:17,845 --> 00:19:21,655
Speaker 6:  There's a new whole like video chat system. There's a,

325
00:19:21,655 --> 00:19:24,455
Speaker 6:  there's a camera and they're also gonna do third party cameras that are separate

326
00:19:24,825 --> 00:19:27,935
Speaker 6:  microphone in the thing. You can, you can talk and chat all at the same time.

327
00:19:28,445 --> 00:19:32,175
Speaker 6:  Lots of focus on online. There's new controllers, all kinds of new stuff.

328
00:19:32,195 --> 00:19:36,055
Speaker 6:  But it's just a, it's just a big rev on the switch. And Richard, you were

329
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:38,695
Speaker 6:  saying right before we got on that there was chip news, right? I missed the

330
00:19:38,695 --> 00:19:39,135
Speaker 6:  chip news.

331
00:19:39,715 --> 00:19:43,215
Speaker 7:  Yes. Nvidia put out a blog post the day after Nintendo announced the switch.

332
00:19:43,535 --> 00:19:46,175
Speaker 7:  A confirming that it again has an Nvidia chip inside of it

333
00:19:47,045 --> 00:19:50,535
Speaker 7:  because It is Nintendo. They didn't really go into details on specs, but

334
00:19:50,535 --> 00:19:53,695
Speaker 7:  they went into far more details than you would generally expect for Nintendo.

335
00:19:53,785 --> 00:19:57,735
Speaker 7:  Confirming that it has DLSS NVIDIA's technology for kind of rendering things

336
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:01,775
Speaker 7:  and downscaling them to make, make them look better. You know, using, using

337
00:20:01,775 --> 00:20:04,815
Speaker 7:  scaling and AI to make things look better and smoother

338
00:20:05,685 --> 00:20:09,335
Speaker 7:  than the hardware kind of should be capable of. So people call it fake frames.

339
00:20:09,455 --> 00:20:12,655
Speaker 7:  I think it works really great in some situations and others we'll see. But

340
00:20:12,655 --> 00:20:16,255
Speaker 7:  it's also going to be capable of real time Ray tracing. The chip has

341
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:20,655
Speaker 7:  Nvidia RT cores and tensor cores. They use to do all this kind of AI

342
00:20:20,655 --> 00:20:23,535
Speaker 7:  magic probably has some relevance to the things they're doing with video

343
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:27,215
Speaker 7:  and with audio. Like there's a mic on the device itself so that you can have

344
00:20:27,215 --> 00:20:30,215
Speaker 7:  it set up in the doc and use it to chat. So I'm sure they're doing noise

345
00:20:30,215 --> 00:20:33,215
Speaker 7:  canceling and all the other features that we've seen from Nvidia over the

346
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:37,095
Speaker 7:  years within this thing. So I, I'm very interested to see how it

347
00:20:37,095 --> 00:20:37,655
Speaker 7:  performs really.

348
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:41,655
Speaker 6:  It does seem like this may, this may not be like a,

349
00:20:41,895 --> 00:20:45,815
Speaker 6:  a huge high-end processor system that they're getting from

350
00:20:45,815 --> 00:20:48,885
Speaker 6:  Nvidia, but like this device actually has kind of a lot to do.

351
00:20:49,745 --> 00:20:52,325
Speaker 6:  And, and one of the things Ash and Andrew were saying is like a lot of the

352
00:20:52,325 --> 00:20:56,245
Speaker 6:  games that they were playing felt bigger and more detailed and

353
00:20:56,245 --> 00:21:00,045
Speaker 6:  like they are games designed to be run on much more powerful hardware

354
00:21:00,045 --> 00:21:03,765
Speaker 6:  than we have in the last version. And so like the, the

355
00:21:04,105 --> 00:21:06,405
Speaker 6:  te it was the Tegra chip inside of the first one, right?

356
00:21:06,405 --> 00:21:09,165
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I'm kind of wondering about that Chip overall because it was, it was

357
00:21:09,205 --> 00:21:13,045
Speaker 5:  a tegra in that w that's all related to the fact that Nvidia thought it would

358
00:21:13,045 --> 00:21:16,595
Speaker 5:  be a smartphone competitor to

359
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,315
Speaker 5:  Qualcomm and that just didn't pan out, right? And so that was the chip back

360
00:21:20,315 --> 00:21:23,515
Speaker 5:  then. And now, you know, they're saying it's a custom chip. We should talk

361
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:27,075
Speaker 5:  about D-L-S-S-A little bit in this context. 'cause it, it's kind of

362
00:21:27,315 --> 00:21:31,195
Speaker 5:  fascinating to see it brought to a mobile device in this specific way where

363
00:21:31,195 --> 00:21:35,135
Speaker 5:  you get all like the better visual fidelity that

364
00:21:35,775 --> 00:21:38,615
Speaker 5:  Ash and Andrew have talked about. And maybe that's just because of D Ls,

365
00:21:38,735 --> 00:21:41,535
Speaker 5:  DLSS. Like May the games aren't, haven't been

366
00:21:42,695 --> 00:21:45,975
Speaker 5:  switched tofi, they're just getting upscaled by ai, by this chip.

367
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:50,955
Speaker 5:  There's usually that's like, I wouldn't say it's power hungry, but it's,

368
00:21:51,295 --> 00:21:55,235
Speaker 5:  that's power intensive, right? To run all of that after you've rendered

369
00:21:55,235 --> 00:21:57,755
Speaker 5:  the game, which is not something we've seen, I think really in the mobile

370
00:21:57,755 --> 00:21:58,515
Speaker 5:  context, which

371
00:21:58,515 --> 00:22:01,395
Speaker 7:  Could also contribute to the fact that it has a, I think, a shorter battery

372
00:22:01,395 --> 00:22:04,555
Speaker 7:  life than the switch one from what we've seen from the specs.

373
00:22:05,695 --> 00:22:09,635
Speaker 7:  So it seems like it, it seems to me like this is a little bit more of a

374
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:12,475
Speaker 7:  doc friendly machine than, than that

375
00:22:12,475 --> 00:22:16,395
Speaker 6:  Was read too. And I, I do wonder like what Nintendo has learned from the

376
00:22:16,395 --> 00:22:18,715
Speaker 6:  first switch that made it think that, 'cause that was my exact reaction too.

377
00:22:18,715 --> 00:22:22,675
Speaker 6:  And even the way that they talked about it, this is much more like a,

378
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:26,275
Speaker 6:  a thing they expect you to play on a table

379
00:22:26,735 --> 00:22:30,715
Speaker 6:  or in, in front of a television or something else. Like even

380
00:22:30,775 --> 00:22:34,715
Speaker 6:  the, even the mouse gesture thing is not a thing you do when you're

381
00:22:34,785 --> 00:22:38,355
Speaker 6:  like sitting on the couch playing video games. Like I assume what Nintendo

382
00:22:38,355 --> 00:22:42,235
Speaker 6:  has discovered is that It is like a sometimes

383
00:22:42,435 --> 00:22:46,115
Speaker 6:  portable device, but a mostly docked device. And I think if you're,

384
00:22:46,655 --> 00:22:50,435
Speaker 6:  if you know that, or you can assume that you get to lean on power

385
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:53,315
Speaker 6:  a little more and battery life a little less, which I think is the opposite

386
00:22:53,315 --> 00:22:56,795
Speaker 6:  of what Nintendo did the first time. Like, especially for 2017,

387
00:22:57,145 --> 00:23:00,535
Speaker 6:  what it managed to get out of the battery was, was

388
00:23:00,535 --> 00:23:03,175
Speaker 6:  reasonably impressive. And it does feel like they, they flipped that balance

389
00:23:03,255 --> 00:23:05,175
Speaker 6:  a little this time, which I think is probably the right call.

390
00:23:05,515 --> 00:23:09,415
Speaker 5:  I'm dying to know. It's funny, we, we talked about Windows

391
00:23:09,415 --> 00:23:10,055
Speaker 5:  Media Center,

392
00:23:11,635 --> 00:23:14,775
Speaker 5:  all this stuff they're adding to it, the mouse mode, the camera, the video

393
00:23:14,965 --> 00:23:18,855
Speaker 5:  chat, it's all getting away from what made the

394
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:22,415
Speaker 5:  switch in particular, such a huge success. Here's this

395
00:23:22,415 --> 00:23:26,025
Speaker 5:  dedicated device for playing games. The best

396
00:23:26,075 --> 00:23:29,865
Speaker 5:  games that, you know, the console makers have, or at least the most well-crafted

397
00:23:29,865 --> 00:23:33,305
Speaker 5:  games that are pretty singular experiences with franchises. People love,

398
00:23:33,765 --> 00:23:35,185
Speaker 5:  not it's a mouse,

399
00:23:37,035 --> 00:23:40,545
Speaker 5:  right? And like Nintendo is very good at like weird interaction paradigms.

400
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:44,425
Speaker 5:  Like they, they did the entire we for, for God's sake. But like there's a

401
00:23:44,425 --> 00:23:47,805
Speaker 5:  part of, you're gonna play Mario on the go and then there's another part

402
00:23:47,805 --> 00:23:51,485
Speaker 5:  that's like, we're gonna talk about the C button a lot because that's the

403
00:23:51,485 --> 00:23:55,345
Speaker 5:  video chat button. And that just seems like now we're

404
00:23:55,345 --> 00:23:59,225
Speaker 5:  competing with phones and there's no reason to do that. Just to be

405
00:23:59,225 --> 00:24:01,585
Speaker 5:  clear, by the way, the, the video calls are optional. You buy the optional

406
00:24:01,585 --> 00:24:04,905
Speaker 5:  camera. If you just push the C button, it's, it's voice calls. But

407
00:24:04,905 --> 00:24:08,785
Speaker 6:  I, it, it, this thing is very social in a way. I think It is really interesting

408
00:24:08,785 --> 00:24:12,385
Speaker 6:  and like I I, I was going back and watching all the old first gen switch

409
00:24:12,565 --> 00:24:16,345
Speaker 6:  ads and they're very much like people out in the world playing on this console

410
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:19,625
Speaker 6:  together. Like hand your buddy a JoyCon and you can like hang out on the

411
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:23,265
Speaker 6:  beach and play games. And this one is like you're in your living room but

412
00:24:23,265 --> 00:24:25,945
Speaker 6:  you're still hanging out with your friends who are not in your living room.

413
00:24:26,225 --> 00:24:28,745
Speaker 6:  And it's like, there's, there's just something that happened in the eight

414
00:24:28,745 --> 00:24:31,625
Speaker 6:  years that is both like Nintendo's probably, right?

415
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:34,145
Speaker 7:  Well I think there is something that happened in the eight years between

416
00:24:34,145 --> 00:24:36,785
Speaker 7:  the, the switch one and the switch two. It was called Covid. It was the whole

417
00:24:36,785 --> 00:24:37,785
Speaker 6:  Thing. We all stopped going outside

418
00:24:38,405 --> 00:24:39,905
Speaker 7:  And that was when they designed this system.

419
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:44,865
Speaker 6:  That's a really good point that if you, if you rewind to the beginning of

420
00:24:44,865 --> 00:24:48,425
Speaker 6:  the, like what is the switch to meetings? It was probably a bunch of people

421
00:24:48,425 --> 00:24:49,665
Speaker 6:  sitting on Zoom calls.

422
00:24:51,725 --> 00:24:55,545
Speaker 5:  That's a, yeah, this is the first of the great covid hardware wave is like

423
00:24:55,545 --> 00:24:59,225
Speaker 5:  super interesting. The mouse in particular gets me, is like,

424
00:24:59,245 --> 00:25:02,065
Speaker 5:  here's this big interaction paradigm that requires you to have a desk.

425
00:25:03,555 --> 00:25:07,005
Speaker 5:  Like how are you gonna use this mouse? You're gonna put it on a desk. Ash

426
00:25:07,025 --> 00:25:10,605
Speaker 5:  was not a huge fan of this mouse. We'll see how it plays out.

427
00:25:10,865 --> 00:25:14,165
Speaker 5:  It just seems like the switch is getting a little bit bigger, right? Like

428
00:25:14,165 --> 00:25:17,565
Speaker 5:  it, the conceptually it's gonna do a little bit more stuff than it did the

429
00:25:17,565 --> 00:25:21,485
Speaker 5:  last time, which is maybe good. Like that's the story of products and

430
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:25,045
Speaker 5:  that's how products had developed. But it, I feel like the switch was as

431
00:25:25,045 --> 00:25:28,765
Speaker 5:  successful as it was because it was relatively inexpensive. It had Zelda

432
00:25:28,765 --> 00:25:32,445
Speaker 5:  and Mario and all the rest of the, it had animal crossing and ultimately

433
00:25:32,445 --> 00:25:34,645
Speaker 5:  it wasn't trying to do more than the things you needed it to do.

434
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:37,525
Speaker 7:  And I think that's what we're going to find out is whether this is the we

435
00:25:37,815 --> 00:25:41,005
Speaker 7:  where it brought people together with kind of a new control dynamic that

436
00:25:41,005 --> 00:25:44,285
Speaker 7:  the other video game systems weren't doing so much then, or if it's the we

437
00:25:44,285 --> 00:25:48,045
Speaker 7:  you where it costs too much and the add-ons they put on it isn't

438
00:25:48,065 --> 00:25:49,405
Speaker 7:  any, It is something that anyone wants.

439
00:25:49,665 --> 00:25:52,365
Speaker 6:  Do you think there's a real risk that this is the we you, because I, I really

440
00:25:52,365 --> 00:25:54,845
Speaker 6:  don't, like, I look at this and, and I'm like, this is, they're doing some

441
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:58,085
Speaker 6:  weird stuff, but fundamentally what everybody wanted from them is a better

442
00:25:58,085 --> 00:26:01,285
Speaker 6:  switch. And it like, it really looks like this is a better switch. Do you

443
00:26:01,285 --> 00:26:04,365
Speaker 6:  think there is actual, like this was a mistake possibility here?

444
00:26:04,985 --> 00:26:08,855
Speaker 5:  It just depends on how much it costs. If this thing, if this thing breaks

445
00:26:08,855 --> 00:26:12,815
Speaker 5:  $500 because of tariffs and big ways, right? If it's,

446
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:16,855
Speaker 5:  if it's, we announced what, 4 49, if it gets to 500 'cause of tariffs, everyone

447
00:26:16,855 --> 00:26:20,415
Speaker 5:  like, oh, it sucks, you know, whatever. If it gets to $600

448
00:26:20,775 --> 00:26:23,655
Speaker 5:  'cause of tariffs, it starts to get, that's pretty expensive,

449
00:26:24,745 --> 00:26:28,175
Speaker 5:  right? And then you still gotta buy games and all this, all all these, you

450
00:26:28,175 --> 00:26:31,775
Speaker 5:  gotta buy the camera, you gotta buy new, do all this other stuff is gonna

451
00:26:31,775 --> 00:26:35,655
Speaker 5:  start happening that'll make it too expensive for where it should

452
00:26:35,655 --> 00:26:39,295
Speaker 5:  live. And that then I think you have to decide how much you love

453
00:26:39,345 --> 00:26:39,695
Speaker 5:  Mario.

454
00:26:40,075 --> 00:26:42,935
Speaker 7:  It might not be the we, it probably isn't the we you, it might be the three

455
00:26:43,025 --> 00:26:43,245
Speaker 7:  Ds.

456
00:26:43,705 --> 00:26:46,165
Speaker 5:  No, that's all same one. I think it's gonna be, I think it's gonna be to

457
00:26:46,165 --> 00:26:48,245
Speaker 5:  switch again. That's your, your prediction is three s or,

458
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:51,255
Speaker 7:  Or maybe maybe the two Ds. I don't, I don't know. I can't remember which

459
00:26:51,255 --> 00:26:51,415
Speaker 7:  one.

460
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:56,685
Speaker 5:  Game Boy Pocket. It's always the side book Game Boy Pocket the Okay Game

461
00:26:56,685 --> 00:26:59,645
Speaker 5:  Boy Pocket every time it comes on the show. I'll remind our high school listeners,

462
00:26:59,905 --> 00:27:03,485
Speaker 5:  it fits perfectly into the slider case. But TI 82

463
00:27:03,485 --> 00:27:04,045
Speaker 5:  calculator

464
00:27:05,795 --> 00:27:08,725
Speaker 5:  something that I learned in 1998,

465
00:27:11,015 --> 00:27:14,405
Speaker 6:  Every part of that reference will make no sense to people in high school.

466
00:27:14,505 --> 00:27:15,445
Speaker 6:  Now. I love it.

467
00:27:15,745 --> 00:27:19,005
Speaker 5:  No, they still sell. There's a store in our town in our little Westchester

468
00:27:19,035 --> 00:27:22,565
Speaker 5:  town, the stationary store. Stationary store is just a

469
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:25,965
Speaker 5:  racket that sells ti calculators to high school students. That's its only

470
00:27:26,085 --> 00:27:26,165
Speaker 5:  business.

471
00:27:26,165 --> 00:27:27,565
Speaker 6:  Are they still like 150 bucks? Yeah,

472
00:27:27,565 --> 00:27:31,525
Speaker 5:  They still cost exactly the same. Unreal. And it's every

473
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:33,685
Speaker 5:  high schooler is required to buy one of these calculators and they all buy

474
00:27:33,765 --> 00:27:36,405
Speaker 5:  'em at the stationary store. And I'm just there, you know, once a week being

475
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,485
Speaker 5:  like, you know, gameboard pocket slits, right? And

476
00:27:40,865 --> 00:27:44,605
Speaker 6:  Can you imagine when tariffs make the TI 83 calculator, like

477
00:27:44,605 --> 00:27:45,845
Speaker 6:  $245?

478
00:27:45,905 --> 00:27:49,525
Speaker 5:  That's how you know that I'm old, is that I'm saying TI 82 and everyone else

479
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:53,565
Speaker 5:  has got the TI 83, which is slightly nicer. T 82 had a square

480
00:27:53,565 --> 00:27:57,245
Speaker 5:  case, which covered the game Boy pocket better. Mm. The problem, and

481
00:27:58,445 --> 00:28:02,185
Speaker 5:  I'm, I'm sorry to my high school math teachers,

482
00:28:02,445 --> 00:28:06,185
Speaker 5:  the problem is that when Ryan Ntel turned on

483
00:28:06,445 --> 00:28:10,425
Speaker 5:  the game, boy it still dinged. And then your calculator

484
00:28:10,425 --> 00:28:13,105
Speaker 5:  and Game Boy were taken away playing Dope

485
00:28:13,135 --> 00:28:15,225
Speaker 7:  Wars wasn't good enough for you. You needed a game boy

486
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:19,105
Speaker 5:  Did you ever code you ever, did you ever, did you code your games right into

487
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:21,105
Speaker 5:  the calculator, Richard? Of course. Hell yeah.

488
00:28:21,105 --> 00:28:24,785
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Come on. I did. I I dealt so much fake drugs on my

489
00:28:25,305 --> 00:28:26,425
Speaker 6:  graphing calculator. Are you kidding me?

490
00:28:26,445 --> 00:28:30,085
Speaker 5:  All right, speaking of dealing drugs, let's talk about TikTok.

491
00:28:31,765 --> 00:28:35,665
Speaker 5:  The, the foremost scourge of our nation's youth. Lots going on,

492
00:28:35,665 --> 00:28:36,665
Speaker 5:  on the TikTok story

493
00:28:38,395 --> 00:28:41,005
Speaker 5:  This weekend is the deadline, Saturday is the deadline.

494
00:28:42,275 --> 00:28:46,235
Speaker 5:  The deadline that was self-imposed by Donald Trump after the

495
00:28:46,235 --> 00:28:50,035
Speaker 5:  actual deadline that was imposed by our nation's Congress and

496
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:53,435
Speaker 5:  upheld by the Supreme Court. So Trump takes office, TikTok was banned,

497
00:28:54,325 --> 00:28:58,285
Speaker 5:  which means they just shut it, the shut the app down as a

498
00:28:58,285 --> 00:29:01,685
Speaker 5:  stunt. Trump said, I'm giving you 75 days.

499
00:29:02,105 --> 00:29:06,005
Speaker 5:  Here's a waiver from Pam Bondy, the Attorney General that says she won't

500
00:29:06,005 --> 00:29:07,685
Speaker 5:  prosecute you for breaking this law.

501
00:29:09,195 --> 00:29:12,565
Speaker 5:  Everyone said that was good enough, which is weird all unto itself totally

502
00:29:12,575 --> 00:29:16,165
Speaker 5:  weird. But here we are at the end of 75 days, there's a rumor

503
00:29:16,635 --> 00:29:19,485
Speaker 5:  that Trump is gonna do something called TikTok America

504
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:23,925
Speaker 5:  where he creates a sovereign wealth fund out of a stolen

505
00:29:24,075 --> 00:29:28,005
Speaker 5:  Bitcoin as near as I can tell. And then

506
00:29:28,005 --> 00:29:31,885
Speaker 5:  that will buy a huge chunk of TikTok by chance will remain

507
00:29:31,885 --> 00:29:35,285
Speaker 5:  on the cap table, which might be illegal because the law says

508
00:29:35,715 --> 00:29:38,885
Speaker 5:  they can't control the app or the algorithm. So I dunno what's gonna happen

509
00:29:38,885 --> 00:29:42,525
Speaker 5:  there. The thing that I have been predicting would happen has

510
00:29:42,685 --> 00:29:46,205
Speaker 5:  apparently happened, Amazon has sent a letter saying they would buy TikTok,

511
00:29:47,795 --> 00:29:50,215
Speaker 5:  The Founder of OnlyFans Wants to Buy TikTok

512
00:29:51,365 --> 00:29:54,795
Speaker 5:  Perplexity keeps insisting that It is a serious buyer for TikTok

513
00:29:55,255 --> 00:29:58,835
Speaker 5:  in sending extremely petty notes to Kylie

514
00:29:59,235 --> 00:30:02,355
Speaker 5:  whenever she notes that, that is doesn't seem realistic,

515
00:30:02,975 --> 00:30:06,515
Speaker 5:  really? Yeah. They were like, no, we're for real. And

516
00:30:06,515 --> 00:30:10,075
Speaker 5:  there's, there's just nothing. I'm sure you are can say to a Appstar AI company

517
00:30:10,105 --> 00:30:14,075
Speaker 5:  that really wants you to believe it can buy TikTok. And then there's, you

518
00:30:14,075 --> 00:30:17,355
Speaker 5:  know, project Liberty, which is Frank McCort and Alexis Hanian and Mr. Beast.

519
00:30:17,855 --> 00:30:21,635
Speaker 5:  And they've got whatever idea about putting TikTok on the

520
00:30:21,685 --> 00:30:22,355
Speaker 5:  blockchain.

521
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:27,715
Speaker 5:  Don't forget App Loving, oh, app Loving. And Steve Wynn somehow is

522
00:30:27,915 --> 00:30:28,395
Speaker 5:  involved in that.

523
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:34,275
Speaker 5:  I'm sure Vergecast listeners are are aware of App Loving. I'm excited

524
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:38,195
Speaker 5:  for more people in America to wake up

525
00:30:38,375 --> 00:30:41,675
Speaker 5:  and be told that a company called App Loving now owns TikTok.

526
00:30:45,745 --> 00:30:47,995
Speaker 5:  It's a lot. That's a lot. What do you think is gonna happen?

527
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:52,275
Speaker 6:  Okay, here, here's where I land on this, which is nowhere. I think the,

528
00:30:52,275 --> 00:30:55,955
Speaker 6:  the, the thing that I have come around to is, I think

529
00:30:56,495 --> 00:31:00,445
Speaker 6:  It is true that there is the money out

530
00:31:00,445 --> 00:31:04,245
Speaker 6:  there in the United States to buy TikTok in a way that

531
00:31:04,815 --> 00:31:08,565
Speaker 6:  would satisfy everybody, right? Like I I I am increasingly

532
00:31:08,565 --> 00:31:11,405
Speaker 6:  convinced that there are actually lots of people who could gin up the money

533
00:31:11,405 --> 00:31:15,205
Speaker 6:  to make this happen relatively quickly. Like it's, it's every investor

534
00:31:15,205 --> 00:31:17,565
Speaker 6:  wants to be part of this that's increasingly clear. Yeah,

535
00:31:17,565 --> 00:31:21,325
Speaker 5:  Jeff Bezos just has to sell a support boat. Not even the big boat. The,

536
00:31:21,345 --> 00:31:24,925
Speaker 6:  The right. What I've learned by watching OpenAI is that like a hundred billion

537
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:27,925
Speaker 6:  dollars is not that hard to come by. Like you can just get it, you can have

538
00:31:27,965 --> 00:31:31,325
Speaker 6:  a hundred billion dollars if you want a hundred billion dollars. So I think

539
00:31:31,755 --> 00:31:35,705
Speaker 6:  that part, I actually am, I, I thought for a while it was gonna be

540
00:31:35,705 --> 00:31:38,185
Speaker 6:  impossible that there was just nobody who was gonna be able to do it for

541
00:31:38,505 --> 00:31:41,625
Speaker 6:  a mix of like financial and antitrust reasons. I no longer think that's the

542
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:45,225
Speaker 6:  case. And I think it's, it's pretty clear that the Trump

543
00:31:45,225 --> 00:31:49,185
Speaker 6:  administration would happily just bend its antitrust rules for whoever

544
00:31:49,205 --> 00:31:53,105
Speaker 6:  it blessed as the new owner of TikTok. There is still, still

545
00:31:53,325 --> 00:31:57,305
Speaker 6:  to this moment, absolutely no evidence that Byan or

546
00:31:57,305 --> 00:31:58,905
Speaker 6:  China is interested in their part of this deal.

547
00:31:59,615 --> 00:32:01,825
Speaker 5:  Just nuts. Especially now that the tariffs have happened,

548
00:32:02,865 --> 00:32:06,525
Speaker 6:  Right? If, if what you need is the blessing of the Chinese

549
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:07,605
Speaker 6:  government to do this,

550
00:32:09,115 --> 00:32:12,815
Speaker 6:  why on earth does that seem more likely to happen now

551
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:17,015
Speaker 6:  than it did yesterday or, or three months ago

552
00:32:17,075 --> 00:32:20,815
Speaker 6:  or a year ago or the first time Trump tried to do this? Like, I, if

553
00:32:21,095 --> 00:32:24,855
Speaker 6:  anything, it seems to me the likelihood of this being possible

554
00:32:25,075 --> 00:32:28,215
Speaker 6:  has gone down over time for that reason. And so I think,

555
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:32,975
Speaker 6:  I think by dance might be willing to call the administration's bluff

556
00:32:33,145 --> 00:32:36,985
Speaker 6:  again and just shut down. And I like, if, if I had

557
00:32:36,985 --> 00:32:38,425
Speaker 6:  to bet, I think it goes dark again.

558
00:32:39,395 --> 00:32:39,885
Speaker 5:  Richard,

559
00:32:42,135 --> 00:32:44,815
Speaker 7:  I think that the most important thing here is that we're having the wrong

560
00:32:44,815 --> 00:32:48,135
Speaker 7:  discussion about TikTok or the wrong discussion about Bite Dance China, the

561
00:32:48,135 --> 00:32:51,575
Speaker 7:  Trump administration. The discussion we need to have is that we should buy

562
00:32:51,575 --> 00:32:51,935
Speaker 7:  TikTok.

563
00:32:52,965 --> 00:32:53,295
Speaker 5:  This is

564
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:54,095
Speaker 7:  Number one.

565
00:32:54,965 --> 00:32:56,375
Speaker 5:  Billion dollars is not hard to come by

566
00:32:56,995 --> 00:33:00,535
Speaker 7:  Any of us will ever have in our lifetime. You see, everyone's putting in

567
00:33:00,535 --> 00:33:04,255
Speaker 7:  bids for TikTok. Why haven't we, we we need to put in a bid for

568
00:33:04,255 --> 00:33:08,095
Speaker 7:  TikTok. We could own TikTok. This is like, this is like a let's buy a

569
00:33:08,095 --> 00:33:11,175
Speaker 7:  bar. It's, it's that conversation. 'cause we're getting to that late hour

570
00:33:11,995 --> 00:33:14,295
Speaker 7:  and we're saying, you know what, we could just buy a bar.

571
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:17,055
Speaker 5:  I've had that conversation so many times in my life.

572
00:33:17,315 --> 00:33:18,255
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah, absolutely.

573
00:33:18,255 --> 00:33:19,215
Speaker 5:  When I lived in, we're gonna start

574
00:33:19,215 --> 00:33:21,775
Speaker 6:  A band, buy a bar and buy TikTok.

575
00:33:21,805 --> 00:33:25,455
Speaker 5:  Okay? Having a band in a band, don't start a band. Don't do that.

576
00:33:25,715 --> 00:33:29,055
Speaker 5:  You will come to a point in your life when you have played the metro in Chicago.

577
00:33:29,115 --> 00:33:32,815
Speaker 5:  You reached all of your dreams and the only available next step is

578
00:33:32,915 --> 00:33:36,815
Speaker 5:  to spend time in a van with the people in your band going

579
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:39,575
Speaker 5:  to midsize Midwestern cities. And you'd be like, nah, it was the wrong choice,

580
00:33:40,245 --> 00:33:44,015
Speaker 5:  just saying. But at that same period of time in my life in Chicago,

581
00:33:44,195 --> 00:33:47,655
Speaker 5:  we would walk by an empty bar, like on the corner

582
00:33:48,115 --> 00:33:52,085
Speaker 5:  by my house, on our way home hammered. And we would be like, we

583
00:33:52,085 --> 00:33:55,285
Speaker 5:  should, we should buy that bar, man. That could be the spot.

584
00:33:55,865 --> 00:33:57,445
Speaker 7:  Buy the bar, buy TikTok.

585
00:33:58,485 --> 00:34:01,845
Speaker 5:  Historically bad idea. Most of them go outta business. I I feel the same

586
00:34:01,845 --> 00:34:03,525
Speaker 5:  is true about our bid for TikTok.

587
00:34:03,525 --> 00:34:03,805
Speaker 6:  Richard,

588
00:34:04,725 --> 00:34:08,695
Speaker 5:  I I'm actually curious why there are not more bidders, right? This is

589
00:34:08,735 --> 00:34:12,615
Speaker 5:  a historically important asset in the American media

590
00:34:12,645 --> 00:34:16,375
Speaker 5:  ecosystem. I'm, I'm honestly curious why we haven't seen

591
00:34:17,235 --> 00:34:21,135
Speaker 5:  the New York Times or News Corporation or

592
00:34:21,135 --> 00:34:24,945
Speaker 5:  whoever, Viacom outta nowhere, paramount

593
00:34:24,945 --> 00:34:27,785
Speaker 5:  Plus is now TikTok, right? Like where, where is that

594
00:34:28,575 --> 00:34:32,235
Speaker 5:  energy from the media conglomerates that all are desperate for

595
00:34:32,475 --> 00:34:36,325
Speaker 5:  distribution? Where's Netflix? Like, this is all stuff that

596
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:38,885
Speaker 5:  would make sense for a bunch of these companies. I understand why Amazon

597
00:34:38,885 --> 00:34:42,245
Speaker 5:  wants TikTok because TikTok shop represents

598
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:46,645
Speaker 5:  an entire marketing channel that connects to purchases that Amazon does

599
00:34:46,645 --> 00:34:49,985
Speaker 5:  not have. Yep. That is a meaningful, I don't know if it's a competitor, but

600
00:34:50,345 --> 00:34:53,945
Speaker 5:  it's, it's just a place where people go to find stuff to buy and then they,

601
00:34:53,965 --> 00:34:54,665
Speaker 6:  Oh, it's definitely like a competitor.

602
00:34:54,665 --> 00:34:55,185
Speaker 5:  And then they buy,

603
00:34:55,805 --> 00:34:59,345
Speaker 6:  Amazon has been desperately trying to do TikTok for years now

604
00:35:00,145 --> 00:35:03,805
Speaker 6:  and with, with essentially no success. And so like, instead if you just took

605
00:35:03,825 --> 00:35:07,645
Speaker 6:  TikTok and just plugged in the Amazon logistics system behind it, it's

606
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:11,685
Speaker 6:  actually the cleanest fit of almost any of these things that

607
00:35:11,685 --> 00:35:15,085
Speaker 6:  I think of. Like Amazon has the cloud services to make the infrastructure

608
00:35:15,085 --> 00:35:18,525
Speaker 6:  work. It has the, the business angle, which is all the shopping stuff that

609
00:35:18,525 --> 00:35:22,485
Speaker 6:  you just talked about. Like, it, it works. Amazon could buy TikTok and

610
00:35:22,485 --> 00:35:25,885
Speaker 6:  the whole thing would make sense immediately in a way that it, it's, it's

611
00:35:25,885 --> 00:35:29,805
Speaker 6:  much more, there's much more of sort of an underpants known thing

612
00:35:29,805 --> 00:35:33,205
Speaker 6:  happening for a lot of these other companies. But I also think, I mean, the

613
00:35:33,205 --> 00:35:36,805
Speaker 6:  answer to a, a lot of these questions is because Trump won't allow it to

614
00:35:36,805 --> 00:35:39,765
Speaker 6:  happen. Happen, right? Like he, he is so at the center of all of this,

615
00:35:39,765 --> 00:35:41,925
Speaker 5:  Well, I don't, I don't know if that's true. Trump wouldn't allow Netflix

616
00:35:41,985 --> 00:35:42,965
Speaker 5:  to buy TikTok. You, you

617
00:35:42,965 --> 00:35:44,965
Speaker 6:  Think Trump would allow the New York Times to buy TikTok

618
00:35:45,505 --> 00:35:48,485
Speaker 5:  Who App Loving, which is just a mobile advertising company that everyone

619
00:35:48,485 --> 00:35:51,885
Speaker 5:  has to say App Loving is like out here being like, we'll do it. Why not?

620
00:35:52,035 --> 00:35:55,925
Speaker 5:  Like Perplexity is like, we'll do it. I like why, honestly,

621
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:59,325
Speaker 5:  why wouldn't Netflix? Which desperately needs a discovery

622
00:35:59,395 --> 00:36:02,585
Speaker 5:  mechanism, right? They all do. Yeah.

623
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:06,865
Speaker 5:  Why wouldn't, why aren't they in this mix? Why isn't Apple in this mix? Like,

624
00:36:07,295 --> 00:36:10,065
Speaker 5:  it's, it's just interesting to see how many people must have kicked the tires,

625
00:36:10,075 --> 00:36:13,185
Speaker 5:  right? They all have big m and a departments. They all have big, big business

626
00:36:13,185 --> 00:36:16,145
Speaker 5:  development departments. It's funny to see how many people are like, no,

627
00:36:16,145 --> 00:36:19,995
Speaker 5:  that's, that's too messy. Social media is too messy. But

628
00:36:19,995 --> 00:36:23,835
Speaker 5:  you can see how any number of media organizations desperately

629
00:36:23,905 --> 00:36:27,795
Speaker 5:  need distribution and they, they're just not in the game. And maybe

630
00:36:28,235 --> 00:36:29,475
Speaker 5:  somebody called Jeff and Ka, it's too hard to find.

631
00:36:31,195 --> 00:36:34,895
Speaker 5:  We, we just need to do Quibi again. Where's Kaz?

632
00:36:35,835 --> 00:36:39,485
Speaker 5:  Where's our guy? By TikTok by the way, we should turn out turn the qui in

633
00:36:39,485 --> 00:36:41,445
Speaker 5:  all fairness to Jerry Katz and per quid

634
00:36:43,175 --> 00:36:46,715
Speaker 5:  not a sentence I thought I would ever say vertical micro

635
00:36:46,895 --> 00:36:49,355
Speaker 5:  dramas are apparently very popular in other countries around the world. We

636
00:36:49,355 --> 00:36:51,515
Speaker 5:  should do a story on that. It's their time.

637
00:36:51,735 --> 00:36:54,035
Speaker 6:  If Quibi had been free, it would've worked. No,

638
00:36:54,035 --> 00:36:57,435
Speaker 5:  Season two of Golden Arm is, is coming. I could feel it. Quibi feel it in

639
00:36:57,435 --> 00:36:59,795
Speaker 5:  you always. That's my prediction. And that's, that's life.

640
00:37:00,955 --> 00:37:01,595
Speaker 6:  Quibi was just

641
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:02,675
Speaker 5:  Early. I will point out, we, It

642
00:37:02,815 --> 00:37:03,795
Speaker 6:  Is a take. I'll go to my grave

643
00:37:03,865 --> 00:37:06,715
Speaker 5:  With we're having exactly the same conversation about who will buy TikTok.

644
00:37:07,055 --> 00:37:10,275
Speaker 5:  Except now there are some bids, but we are having the exact same conversation

645
00:37:10,685 --> 00:37:13,915
Speaker 5:  today as we did 75 days ago.

646
00:37:15,425 --> 00:37:19,165
Speaker 5:  And the d the deadline is tomorrow as you're listening to this, on Friday,

647
00:37:19,165 --> 00:37:20,725
Speaker 5:  the deadline is Saturday, it's the fifth.

648
00:37:21,685 --> 00:37:25,425
Speaker 6:  And there's still absolutely no indication that it's for sale. Like

649
00:37:25,575 --> 00:37:28,585
Speaker 6:  this is a bunch of people standing outside of a house being like, I'd like

650
00:37:28,585 --> 00:37:31,985
Speaker 6:  to buy that house. And the person inside not selling the house.

651
00:37:32,695 --> 00:37:36,625
Speaker 6:  This is not, you can't buy a thing that's not for sale and there's

652
00:37:36,685 --> 00:37:39,745
Speaker 6:  no evidence at all that It is for sale. Yeah.

653
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:42,905
Speaker 5:  I mean, again, and it's just funny 'cause the number of people who should

654
00:37:42,905 --> 00:37:46,745
Speaker 5:  be beating down the door to buy this thing should be by all rights much

655
00:37:46,745 --> 00:37:47,385
Speaker 5:  higher than it's

656
00:37:48,395 --> 00:37:52,215
Speaker 6:  Yes. I do think, I mean we, we've seen this before, like when Disney kicked

657
00:37:52,335 --> 00:37:55,615
Speaker 6:  the tires on Twitter. And I think, I think there are a lot of companies who

658
00:37:55,825 --> 00:37:59,695
Speaker 6:  understand the, the mess that is social and

659
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:02,055
Speaker 6:  just are not set up to do it. Yeah. But like, yeah, but I get notes. Netflix

660
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:04,575
Speaker 6:  buys TikTok and immediately becomes a completely different kind of company.

661
00:38:04,585 --> 00:38:08,535
Speaker 6:  Right. And I think it, it's not crazy to sign up for that, but it's not just

662
00:38:08,575 --> 00:38:10,055
Speaker 6:  a thing you can do.

663
00:38:10,065 --> 00:38:13,575
Speaker 5:  Right. But every single time we have some streaming executive on

664
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:17,695
Speaker 5:  decoder or some product person from one of these companies on decoder,

665
00:38:18,575 --> 00:38:22,535
Speaker 5:  I get notes from product people around the industry. They're like,

666
00:38:22,535 --> 00:38:25,535
Speaker 5:  you don't understand what they're all saying in every meeting at Disney at

667
00:38:25,535 --> 00:38:29,485
Speaker 5:  Paramount Plus at Max's. Why can't we have a YouTube? Yeah. Like

668
00:38:29,605 --> 00:38:32,645
Speaker 5:  they're all staring at the, the thing that is going to kill them

669
00:38:34,085 --> 00:38:36,965
Speaker 5:  down the line. Di like at Disney there are meetings are like, why don't we

670
00:38:36,965 --> 00:38:40,125
Speaker 5:  have a YouTube at max? There are meetings are like, why don't we have a YouTube?

671
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:43,525
Speaker 5:  Because they see the thing and there are obvious reasons that they don't.

672
00:38:44,225 --> 00:38:47,165
Speaker 5:  But in this one case, they could buy a thing that's almost like it.

673
00:38:48,135 --> 00:38:51,585
Speaker 6:  Yeah, no, it's, it's certainly the closest to just going

674
00:38:51,975 --> 00:38:55,145
Speaker 6:  from nothing to something that has been available maybe ever.

675
00:38:55,215 --> 00:38:57,485
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And yet yet,

676
00:38:58,565 --> 00:38:58,685
Speaker 6:  I

677
00:38:58,685 --> 00:39:02,525
Speaker 5:  Know it's gonna be App Love Everybody. No, no Shade App Love. And it's just

678
00:39:02,525 --> 00:39:06,485
Speaker 5:  a very funny name. And I am dying for the TikTok conspiracy theories that

679
00:39:06,485 --> 00:39:09,685
Speaker 5:  will occur if a company named App Loven buys this, buys this platform.

680
00:39:09,785 --> 00:39:11,925
Speaker 6:  TikTok Buy App Loving has a really great retailer.

681
00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:15,005
Speaker 5:  We'll find out either TikTok will exist next week when we do the show or

682
00:39:15,005 --> 00:39:16,605
Speaker 5:  it won't, or Trump we're

683
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:19,485
Speaker 6:  Gonna buy it and it's just gonna be Detroit Pistons highlights and trucks

684
00:39:19,485 --> 00:39:20,565
Speaker 6:  jumping over stuff. Steve,

685
00:39:20,565 --> 00:39:23,685
Speaker 5:  Richard, and I'm here for it Ate. We're buying TikTok and it's, it's just

686
00:39:23,745 --> 00:39:27,005
Speaker 5:  us forcing Richard to purchase and rehabilitate a bar.

687
00:39:27,885 --> 00:39:31,805
Speaker 5:  Yep. That's it. Like, you've gotta find one. You've gotta, that's the

688
00:39:31,845 --> 00:39:34,085
Speaker 5:  people want. You gotta do the TikTok thing, you know, like the the time-lapse

689
00:39:34,085 --> 00:39:37,325
Speaker 5:  video of like tearing down the drywall and putting it back up.

690
00:39:38,575 --> 00:39:42,205
Speaker 5:  We're gonna make Richard install gray floors in one of those like bronze

691
00:39:42,495 --> 00:39:46,285
Speaker 5:  chandelier things. It is gonna be great. I'm excited for it. All right, we

692
00:39:46,285 --> 00:39:48,445
Speaker 5:  gotta take a break. We're gonna come back. We're gonna start talking about

693
00:39:48,445 --> 00:39:50,165
Speaker 5:  tariffs. It's gonna happen. We'll be right back.

694
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:19,585
Speaker 5:  We have to talk about Terra. We do. It is, I know

695
00:43:20,285 --> 00:43:23,945
Speaker 5:  the only story, like in the biggest way, usually with

696
00:43:23,945 --> 00:43:27,465
Speaker 5:  politics we have to draw some line to like phones.

697
00:43:28,725 --> 00:43:32,265
Speaker 5:  You know, like, here's why The Verge is covering politics and I I want us

698
00:43:32,265 --> 00:43:36,145
Speaker 5:  to cover politics. We, we do it, we cover policy very deeply. Like

699
00:43:36,145 --> 00:43:38,945
Speaker 5:  usually you have to make an argument for politics and policy in our stories,

700
00:43:38,945 --> 00:43:42,745
Speaker 5:  right? We, we cover consumer tech, Wes, a line to politics in

701
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:46,265
Speaker 5:  policy. And I want us to explain why we cover things like the

702
00:43:46,305 --> 00:43:50,225
Speaker 5:  FCC or why we cover things like the National, national Institutes of Science.

703
00:43:50,225 --> 00:43:54,015
Speaker 5:  Like there's, or the National Institutes of Health. Like there's research

704
00:43:54,015 --> 00:43:56,615
Speaker 5:  that gets done at the federal level. There's policies at the Federal Trade

705
00:43:56,615 --> 00:44:00,255
Speaker 5:  Commission. All this stuff affects the gadgets we make. Tariffs is much different

706
00:44:00,815 --> 00:44:04,345
Speaker 5:  'cause the prices are just gonna go up and the supply chains that create

707
00:44:04,345 --> 00:44:07,985
Speaker 5:  all the hardware is gonna go sideways. And there's not a great

708
00:44:08,225 --> 00:44:11,905
Speaker 5:  argument for any of these tariffs right now. So Trump announced them.

709
00:44:12,665 --> 00:44:15,645
Speaker 5:  The stock market literally crashed while he was speaking at the White House.

710
00:44:16,345 --> 00:44:17,485
Speaker 5:  You just saw the numbers go down.

711
00:44:19,005 --> 00:44:22,925
Speaker 5:  I, I watched CNBC today. I people, I know the anchors at

712
00:44:22,965 --> 00:44:26,845
Speaker 5:  CNBC just openly confused Carl Quintin,

713
00:44:27,095 --> 00:44:30,325
Speaker 5:  who's a great anchor at CNBC, A friend, he said, you're burning down the

714
00:44:30,325 --> 00:44:33,285
Speaker 5:  house to cook a cheeseburger, which is an incredible quote. That is good.

715
00:44:34,135 --> 00:44:37,605
Speaker 5:  Steve Mnuchin, who was treasury secretary Trump won, said

716
00:44:38,345 --> 00:44:42,245
Speaker 5:  to Sarah Eisen, I believe, don't think too hard about how these tariff were

717
00:44:42,245 --> 00:44:42,765
Speaker 5:  calculated.

718
00:44:43,365 --> 00:44:47,285
Speaker 6:  I mean, that's the thing, like I think when you say there's not a great reason

719
00:44:47,345 --> 00:44:50,685
Speaker 6:  for it, I think that is, that is actually like far too kind.

720
00:44:51,275 --> 00:44:55,125
Speaker 6:  Like this is, this is pure nonsense and, and I think

721
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:58,925
Speaker 6:  it's nonsense what we have seen from the reaction. Like you

722
00:44:58,925 --> 00:45:02,805
Speaker 6:  cannot find someone who can give you a measured reason

723
00:45:02,805 --> 00:45:04,565
Speaker 6:  why this is a good idea. Right? You

724
00:45:04,565 --> 00:45:08,325
Speaker 5:  Can find something, you can find chat GPT, which will Yes.

725
00:45:08,535 --> 00:45:12,365
Speaker 5:  Which will deliver you the calculation that is used to calculate tariff rates.

726
00:45:12,715 --> 00:45:15,485
Speaker 6:  Well, so, but that's the thing, right? And it's insanity all the way down

727
00:45:15,485 --> 00:45:19,365
Speaker 6:  because it's like you, you rewind back through the campaign and,

728
00:45:19,365 --> 00:45:23,155
Speaker 6:  and everybody was like, well, Trump clearly just doesn't understand how

729
00:45:23,155 --> 00:45:26,275
Speaker 6:  tariffs actually work. It's just like a thing he likes to say. It's like

730
00:45:26,435 --> 00:45:29,955
Speaker 6:  a hobby horse of his. He won't do them. And then immediately took office

731
00:45:30,015 --> 00:45:33,195
Speaker 6:  and started doing them. And everybody was like, well, they won't be as bad

732
00:45:33,195 --> 00:45:36,595
Speaker 6:  as he thought. And so over and over and over, the people who like

733
00:45:37,155 --> 00:45:40,475
Speaker 6:  believed in him as an economic driver for the United States were like, he

734
00:45:40,475 --> 00:45:43,915
Speaker 6:  won't do this. And then he did this and it was so much worse than

735
00:45:44,615 --> 00:45:48,475
Speaker 6:  anyone anyone thought it was going to be. And then the more

736
00:45:48,475 --> 00:45:51,835
Speaker 6:  we've learned about why It is the way that It is and how it was calculated

737
00:45:51,835 --> 00:45:55,275
Speaker 6:  and how it was created and how it came to be, the more, the only

738
00:45:56,315 --> 00:46:00,235
Speaker 6:  possible logic has become, none of this makes any sense. It

739
00:46:00,235 --> 00:46:02,395
Speaker 5:  Is true that the United States Trade Representative put out a fact sheet

740
00:46:02,395 --> 00:46:06,285
Speaker 5:  about the tariffs with a formula in it that was supposed

741
00:46:06,285 --> 00:46:09,565
Speaker 5:  to explain how they calculated these tariff rates. And the formula contains

742
00:46:10,045 --> 00:46:12,685
Speaker 5:  a bunch of Greek letters, two of which when you back at 'em out to the numbers,

743
00:46:12,685 --> 00:46:16,005
Speaker 5:  just cancel each other out. What you have is a trade deficit divided in half

744
00:46:16,185 --> 00:46:20,005
Speaker 5:  to calculate the rate. And then the floor is 10%. And the rates, the tariff

745
00:46:20,005 --> 00:46:23,765
Speaker 5:  rates are against islands that have nothing but penguins on them.

746
00:46:23,945 --> 00:46:24,165
Speaker 5:  But

747
00:46:24,235 --> 00:46:28,205
Speaker 6:  It's, it's so important to keep saying that's nothing, what you just described

748
00:46:28,265 --> 00:46:28,725
Speaker 6:  is nothing.

749
00:46:28,735 --> 00:46:31,645
Speaker 5:  Right? And they're described as reciprocal tariffs against countries. Adeno

750
00:46:31,645 --> 00:46:35,365
Speaker 5:  tariffs on us. No, none of this makes any sense. Not,

751
00:46:35,365 --> 00:46:37,925
Speaker 6:  These are not trade deficits, it's countries we buy things from.

752
00:46:39,085 --> 00:46:42,415
Speaker 6:  Like that's, those are not the same thing. It's like, there there was, I

753
00:46:42,415 --> 00:46:44,735
Speaker 6:  saw a thing this morning that was like, you don't have a trade deficit from

754
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,855
Speaker 6:  your dentist because your dentist doesn't buy anything from you. You buy

755
00:46:47,855 --> 00:46:51,655
Speaker 6:  things from your dentist. Like, it's just nonsense. And

756
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:54,775
Speaker 6:  and we're at a point now where it's like we've gone way beyond

757
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:59,135
Speaker 6:  even like even now, the, the Trump administration being like, this is about

758
00:46:59,695 --> 00:47:02,295
Speaker 6:  fentanyl crossing the borders, and this is how we punish the countries who

759
00:47:02,295 --> 00:47:06,055
Speaker 6:  allow this to happen. That seems reasonable compared to where we are

760
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:10,015
Speaker 6:  now. Which is just, they went in and they were like, oh, well we have

761
00:47:10,015 --> 00:47:13,375
Speaker 6:  a trade deficit with them. Let's tariff the opposite of that and that'll

762
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:14,855
Speaker 6:  sort it out. That's nothing.

763
00:47:16,635 --> 00:47:20,135
Speaker 5:  So I wanna say there's been a lot of reporting, including from us,

764
00:47:20,445 --> 00:47:24,095
Speaker 5:  that, that it's the ais that come up with this kind of math.

765
00:47:24,555 --> 00:47:28,535
Speaker 5:  And It is true. Chacha PD comes up with this math. Claude comes up

766
00:47:28,535 --> 00:47:32,405
Speaker 5:  with this math grok important one in the Trump administration because that's

767
00:47:32,465 --> 00:47:36,245
Speaker 5:  Elon's comes up with this math. Gemini will come up with this math. But if

768
00:47:36,245 --> 00:47:40,165
Speaker 5:  you switch to Gemini 2.5 Pro, which everyone got mad at us for

769
00:47:40,285 --> 00:47:42,845
Speaker 5:  ignoring last week, but I it's now I'm using it. Y'all, y'all yell at us

770
00:47:43,585 --> 00:47:47,005
Speaker 5:  and you ask it to show thinking on this prompt. It's basically like

771
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:48,605
Speaker 5:  the user's an idiot.

772
00:47:52,075 --> 00:47:55,845
Speaker 5:  Like, like, it's like literally the second one analyze the

773
00:47:55,845 --> 00:47:59,805
Speaker 5:  user's premise is the user assumes tariffs are a simple direct tool to

774
00:47:59,805 --> 00:48:03,125
Speaker 5:  achieve balanced trade. And that a single calculation method can achieve

775
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:06,965
Speaker 5:  this across coun and countries. And then it just scrolls down and it gets

776
00:48:06,965 --> 00:48:10,765
Speaker 5:  to a place that says address the easy way request. And it says,

777
00:48:10,935 --> 00:48:14,925
Speaker 5:  given the complexity, there is no easy way to calculate tariffs that will

778
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:18,445
Speaker 5:  precisely bounce trade. The premise itself is flawed. So

779
00:48:18,715 --> 00:48:21,885
Speaker 5:  look, I'm not saying that they used AI or not. I'm just saying maybe they

780
00:48:21,885 --> 00:48:25,565
Speaker 5:  should have used Gemini 2.5 Pro, which would've gently let them down.

781
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:29,965
Speaker 6:  It's tough. I am, I'm generally suspicious of the, like they wrote this

782
00:48:30,205 --> 00:48:34,085
Speaker 6:  official document with AI argument. I think like, people are dumb

783
00:48:34,225 --> 00:48:38,205
Speaker 6:  is usually a more compelling outcome than the, like the, the Occam's razor

784
00:48:38,265 --> 00:48:42,005
Speaker 6:  is people are stupid, not people use ai. This one is really,

785
00:48:42,625 --> 00:48:46,445
Speaker 6:  really, it's not really hard to disagree. Like it, you put it in and

786
00:48:46,445 --> 00:48:49,085
Speaker 6:  over and over people have run this experiment over and over again. You can

787
00:48:49,085 --> 00:48:52,645
Speaker 6:  get it to give you that answer as long as you ask a stupid question, which

788
00:48:52,785 --> 00:48:55,445
Speaker 5:  No human economist will give you that answer. No,

789
00:48:55,475 --> 00:48:59,165
Speaker 6:  This is what I mean, like the reaction has been so universal that It is,

790
00:48:59,225 --> 00:49:00,805
Speaker 6:  It is unreal.

791
00:49:02,045 --> 00:49:05,725
Speaker 5:  Anyhow, look this is gonna affect the price of iPhones, it will affect the

792
00:49:05,725 --> 00:49:09,325
Speaker 5:  price of The Nintendo Switch. Two, we, we have a piece, trying to guess how

793
00:49:09,325 --> 00:49:13,205
Speaker 5:  much the price will go up in the switch. Two, it's a debacle of epic proportions

794
00:49:13,205 --> 00:49:17,005
Speaker 5:  for the auto industry. That's a quote we ran in a story that Andy Hawkins

795
00:49:17,005 --> 00:49:20,365
Speaker 5:  wrote. We're gonna track all this fallout across the board. There's a chance

796
00:49:20,525 --> 00:49:22,965
Speaker 5:  that Trump just walks them all back. That's a thing that he does all the

797
00:49:22,965 --> 00:49:26,325
Speaker 5:  time. Yeah, there's a chance that this is all just a, a weird

798
00:49:26,725 --> 00:49:30,365
Speaker 5:  racket. We, we've been calling it gangster tech regulation. He just wants

799
00:49:30,365 --> 00:49:33,605
Speaker 5:  people to deal. So he, he does this gangstery stuff.

800
00:49:34,095 --> 00:49:37,605
Speaker 5:  We'll see how this shakes out, but I actually wanted to make this real for

801
00:49:37,605 --> 00:49:41,545
Speaker 5:  our audience. I think you can go get a bunch of pie in the sky

802
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:45,145
Speaker 5:  tariff coverage everywhere, but we cover people who make things,

803
00:49:45,195 --> 00:49:49,145
Speaker 5:  right. Not just big companies, but small companies. I, we love an

804
00:49:49,145 --> 00:49:52,625
Speaker 5:  indie hardware maker here on the show. So you might've heard me talk about

805
00:49:52,785 --> 00:49:56,745
Speaker 5:  a company called Tuneshine before, and the founder of Tuneshine is a guy

806
00:49:56,745 --> 00:50:00,425
Speaker 5:  named Tobi Butler. I've read notes about tariffs from him on the show before

807
00:50:00,425 --> 00:50:04,375
Speaker 5:  he's emailed me. I was like, I should write a

808
00:50:04,375 --> 00:50:08,135
Speaker 5:  story about the Tuneshine and tariffs. And then all the s news happened and

809
00:50:08,135 --> 00:50:11,775
Speaker 5:  I thought to myself, oh, we should just have Tobias on the show. So let's

810
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:15,455
Speaker 5:  bring 'em on Now. Tobias s Butler, you are the, the founder you the sole

811
00:50:15,455 --> 00:50:19,295
Speaker 5:  proprietor of, of Tuneshine. Welcome to the Birch Cast. Thank you Eli.

812
00:50:19,295 --> 00:50:22,775
Speaker 5:  Glad to be here. So as you, as Tobias knows, I have a Tuneshine. I love it.

813
00:50:22,805 --> 00:50:26,055
Speaker 5:  Explain quickly what it's So Tuneshine is a

814
00:50:26,585 --> 00:50:30,005
Speaker 9:  Lo-fi album art display that uses this kind of pixelated,

815
00:50:30,435 --> 00:50:34,085
Speaker 9:  very tasteful, almost artistic screen to automatically show the album artwork

816
00:50:34,085 --> 00:50:37,965
Speaker 9:  for the music you listen to. Works with Spotify, apple Music, and Sonos.

817
00:50:38,445 --> 00:50:42,245
Speaker 9:  I definitely recommend, like, if you're listening to this on a podcast app,

818
00:50:42,485 --> 00:50:45,525
Speaker 9:  checking out a picture of it. It's a very visual experience and often it'll

819
00:50:45,765 --> 00:50:49,365
Speaker 9:  kind of click with people. But yeah, it's basically supposed to add this

820
00:50:49,365 --> 00:50:53,325
Speaker 9:  nice ambient artwork to decorate your room and it connects with the kind

821
00:50:53,325 --> 00:50:56,085
Speaker 9:  of music you like and help represent that visually in Your space.

822
00:50:56,385 --> 00:50:59,805
Speaker 5:  So I started talking to Tobias because I demanded features and he, he delivered

823
00:50:59,805 --> 00:51:03,525
Speaker 5:  them. So I will point out that he, you just added Shazam support

824
00:51:04,185 --> 00:51:07,925
Speaker 5:  to the tune fund. So if you're listening, if I'm listening to vinyl at my

825
00:51:07,925 --> 00:51:10,565
Speaker 5:  house, I can just push the button and the, the album mark shows up there.

826
00:51:10,755 --> 00:51:11,965
Speaker 5:  It's a choice. I love this thing.

827
00:51:12,435 --> 00:51:13,885
Speaker 9:  Cool. Really appreciate it. Surpris

828
00:51:13,885 --> 00:51:15,605
Speaker 5:  You. It's just you, right? There's no one else in the company.

829
00:51:15,955 --> 00:51:19,925
Speaker 9:  Yeah, it's just me. Increasingly, I'm kind of doing some things with,

830
00:51:19,925 --> 00:51:23,045
Speaker 9:  with contractors. I've just recently

831
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:27,645
Speaker 9:  got set up with a contract manufacturer based in the US in Chicago

832
00:51:28,255 --> 00:51:32,085
Speaker 9:  doing contracting with fulfillment companies to actually mail things out.

833
00:51:32,085 --> 00:51:35,805
Speaker 9:  Which is great because that means that I don't have to be home every

834
00:51:35,805 --> 00:51:39,285
Speaker 9:  weekday of every week and tune signs will still go out to people. But as

835
00:51:39,285 --> 00:51:42,925
Speaker 9:  far as the product development, coding, marketing,

836
00:51:43,695 --> 00:51:45,245
Speaker 9:  admin stuff, that is all me.

837
00:51:45,385 --> 00:51:48,965
Speaker 5:  And there's a, a part of this story, which I am very taken by, which is you

838
00:51:48,965 --> 00:51:52,445
Speaker 5:  worked at a tech company and you quit to start this company, right?

839
00:51:53,145 --> 00:51:56,925
Speaker 9:  Yes. That's, that's basically correct. I, I quit kind of thinking, okay,

840
00:51:57,125 --> 00:52:00,845
Speaker 9:  I have like a little bit of a nest egg enough to sort of

841
00:52:00,845 --> 00:52:04,525
Speaker 9:  explore different options because I sort of thought, okay, It is a good time

842
00:52:04,525 --> 00:52:08,325
Speaker 9:  in my life. I don't have kids yet. I, my budget is still pretty

843
00:52:08,685 --> 00:52:12,525
Speaker 9:  flexible. Maybe I should just see if there's other things that I like

844
00:52:12,525 --> 00:52:15,405
Speaker 9:  that aren't web development, which is basically what I was doing before.

845
00:52:16,945 --> 00:52:20,325
Speaker 9:  And I basically discovered that I did want to continue to do coding, but

846
00:52:20,405 --> 00:52:24,245
Speaker 9:  I really wanted to give Tuneshine a try. It was just giving me good

847
00:52:24,275 --> 00:52:28,045
Speaker 9:  indications that it could be a business. Not only that I would be able to

848
00:52:28,695 --> 00:52:32,565
Speaker 9:  start and had the skills enough to get pretty close, but also

849
00:52:32,565 --> 00:52:35,805
Speaker 9:  that it was something that people were wanting. My friends were asking about

850
00:52:35,805 --> 00:52:39,605
Speaker 9:  it and I love music. I'm a musician. I studied music

851
00:52:39,625 --> 00:52:43,085
Speaker 9:  in school. So working on a music product just sort of made sense. So that's

852
00:52:43,085 --> 00:52:44,845
Speaker 9:  why I decided to give it a go. This

853
00:52:44,845 --> 00:52:48,765
Speaker 6:  Might be a really stupid question, but it is like before the now times

854
00:52:49,585 --> 00:52:53,285
Speaker 6:  is, is when you go to start a business like this and you're like, okay, I'm

855
00:52:53,405 --> 00:52:55,725
Speaker 6:  starting to source hardware. I, I kind of know the thing I wanna build. I

856
00:52:55,725 --> 00:52:58,845
Speaker 6:  have to meet manufacturer. Do you have to become a tariffs expert anyway?

857
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:01,925
Speaker 6:  Like is that a thing that's on your mind as you're starting a company like

858
00:53:01,925 --> 00:53:02,045
Speaker 6:  this?

859
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:06,045
Speaker 9:  I mean, prior to the first Trump

860
00:53:06,115 --> 00:53:10,085
Speaker 9:  tariffs, which applied 25% tariff to a lot of

861
00:53:10,085 --> 00:53:13,725
Speaker 9:  things. So I've always had tariffs on the, the circuit boards that

862
00:53:13,965 --> 00:53:17,525
Speaker 9:  I was getting from China and the LED

863
00:53:17,555 --> 00:53:21,485
Speaker 9:  screens, which I think are also in that classification or

864
00:53:21,505 --> 00:53:24,285
Speaker 9:  at least among the classifications that get those things.

865
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:29,805
Speaker 9:  I mean, I think that yes, you are thinking about this,

866
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:33,645
Speaker 9:  however, if you are trying something out for the first time, especially

867
00:53:33,825 --> 00:53:37,805
Speaker 9:  if it's your first time doing this as a hardware founder, there's gonna be

868
00:53:37,805 --> 00:53:41,525
Speaker 9:  so many unknowns anyway that that is probably just gonna be one of many unknowns

869
00:53:41,525 --> 00:53:45,085
Speaker 9:  that you encounter along the way. I think people who are maybe on their second

870
00:53:45,105 --> 00:53:48,085
Speaker 9:  or third go are probably thinking a couple steps ahead on this, which of

871
00:53:48,085 --> 00:53:51,965
Speaker 9:  course is much harder to do now that things are changing like twice a week.

872
00:53:52,065 --> 00:53:54,885
Speaker 9:  But, so that's, it's it's a mixed answer.

873
00:53:55,285 --> 00:53:59,005
Speaker 5:  I may ask you just a really reductive question 'cause I, I, I have the product

874
00:53:59,065 --> 00:54:02,525
Speaker 5:  and I like it and I I see that it's like thoughtfully created,

875
00:54:02,945 --> 00:54:06,405
Speaker 5:  but at a very abstract level it's a circuit board, a

876
00:54:06,625 --> 00:54:10,565
Speaker 5:  microcontrollers, some wifi chips and a display. And then I,

877
00:54:10,645 --> 00:54:13,405
Speaker 5:  I think you make the case, I actually discovered this product 'cause there's

878
00:54:13,405 --> 00:54:16,965
Speaker 5:  videos of you on TikTok making the cases. And I was like, well that's cool.

879
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:21,485
Speaker 5:  I'm assuming that the wood for the cases is not tariffed yet, but it

880
00:54:21,485 --> 00:54:22,645
Speaker 5:  might be soon. We'll find out.

881
00:54:23,225 --> 00:54:26,165
Speaker 9:  So I, for a long time I was doing the assembly

882
00:54:26,885 --> 00:54:30,445
Speaker 9:  myself, but I don't have a CNC machine to actually carve the case outta the

883
00:54:30,645 --> 00:54:34,565
Speaker 9:  material. I am gonna continue to, there's gonna be some special additions,

884
00:54:34,565 --> 00:54:37,365
Speaker 9:  limited runs and I will continue to assemble those at home just 'cause I

885
00:54:37,365 --> 00:54:40,925
Speaker 9:  think it's very, I, I like having that physical connection to the product

886
00:54:41,065 --> 00:54:45,005
Speaker 9:  and while I can't scale up enough to do all of these things, I think

887
00:54:45,005 --> 00:54:48,765
Speaker 9:  people really like knowing that they bought something that was,

888
00:54:50,345 --> 00:54:53,685
Speaker 9:  you know, not artisanal. I'm, I'm really just screwing it together. But they

889
00:54:53,685 --> 00:54:55,605
Speaker 9:  like having that connection. Right?

890
00:54:55,785 --> 00:54:59,485
Speaker 5:  But those parts, right, wifi chip controller, circuit

891
00:54:59,495 --> 00:55:03,445
Speaker 5:  board display, all of that was coming from China before,

892
00:55:03,445 --> 00:55:06,085
Speaker 5:  right? Yes. You weren't getting that domestically. Yeah. And so you're paying

893
00:55:06,115 --> 00:55:10,085
Speaker 5:  some rate and the rate might have gone up because of Trump won tariffs, but

894
00:55:10,085 --> 00:55:12,645
Speaker 5:  you could basically go to suppliers and say, I wanna buy this stuff and get

895
00:55:12,645 --> 00:55:13,245
Speaker 5:  prices back.

896
00:55:13,945 --> 00:55:17,845
Speaker 9:  Yes. Yes. And the easiest way to do that is to get

897
00:55:17,845 --> 00:55:21,605
Speaker 9:  an Alibaba. People are super responsive. I, you know, you, you hear

898
00:55:21,605 --> 00:55:25,285
Speaker 9:  this Simone y the, the robot

899
00:55:25,285 --> 00:55:28,805
Speaker 9:  creator was talking about this recently where you reach out to a bunch of

900
00:55:28,805 --> 00:55:31,845
Speaker 9:  manufacturers in the US and Europe and your response rate is really low.

901
00:55:32,405 --> 00:55:36,005
Speaker 9:  I think some of that is just because they are

902
00:55:36,345 --> 00:55:40,205
Speaker 9:  not as optimized for small clients. I think some of that

903
00:55:40,785 --> 00:55:44,645
Speaker 9:  is just a company culture thing that's pervasive here.

904
00:55:44,665 --> 00:55:48,485
Speaker 9:  But if you go on Alibaba, you're able to find these manufacturers,

905
00:55:49,665 --> 00:55:53,565
Speaker 9:  buy from them, get samples and everything's consolidated into a single app.

906
00:55:53,795 --> 00:55:57,725
Speaker 9:  It's sort of a weird janky app and they're a little bit iffy with their push

907
00:55:57,725 --> 00:56:01,485
Speaker 9:  notification policies. But you can talk to everybody in the same

908
00:56:01,545 --> 00:56:04,285
Speaker 9:  app and it makes the whole thing very streamlined.

909
00:56:04,505 --> 00:56:08,445
Speaker 5:  So I emailed you when the first round of tariffs and

910
00:56:08,445 --> 00:56:11,445
Speaker 5:  this Trump administration was happening. You said, my presses will go up

911
00:56:11,445 --> 00:56:14,085
Speaker 5:  and down. I'm not sure what's gonna happen. Now we're here in the second

912
00:56:14,215 --> 00:56:17,885
Speaker 5:  round. Who knows what's gonna happen, what's gonna happen to

913
00:56:17,885 --> 00:56:20,765
Speaker 5:  Tuneshine? Are your prices gonna go up? Is the company still sustainable?

914
00:56:20,995 --> 00:56:24,965
Speaker 9:  Yeah, so I was kind of, before I was fell asleep last

915
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:27,765
Speaker 9:  night, you know, I'm, I'm doom scrolling a little bit and I'm just like,

916
00:56:27,865 --> 00:56:31,485
Speaker 9:  oh no, like maybe I am, I am gonna have to raise prices.

917
00:56:31,825 --> 00:56:35,125
Speaker 9:  And when I double checked my numbers this morning, 'cause I just put out

918
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:39,045
Speaker 9:  a video talking through the effects, I think it might have, it

919
00:56:39,305 --> 00:56:42,885
Speaker 9:  looked like what actually came out to was basically a

920
00:56:42,905 --> 00:56:46,845
Speaker 9:  10% increase in the price of each manufactured Tuneshine and

921
00:56:46,845 --> 00:56:50,405
Speaker 9:  the reali. And the reason it's not the full like 54%

922
00:56:50,925 --> 00:56:54,005
Speaker 9:  increase that is going to be applied is the tariffs from China

923
00:56:54,705 --> 00:56:58,565
Speaker 9:  is for a few reasons. One is that some of this stuff was already tariffed.

924
00:56:58,705 --> 00:57:02,565
Speaker 9:  In fact, much of this stuff was already tariffed. So the increase

925
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,445
Speaker 9:  is more like 25 ish percent, not the full 54.

926
00:57:06,385 --> 00:57:10,005
Speaker 9:  The other thing is that the labor cost, like the, you know, the

927
00:57:10,315 --> 00:57:12,765
Speaker 9:  most expensive parts of the Tuneshine are

928
00:57:13,985 --> 00:57:17,885
Speaker 9:  screen circuit board and labor. At the moment, the way I'm manufacturing

929
00:57:17,885 --> 00:57:21,165
Speaker 9:  it, labor cost is not tariffed 'cause that's done in the us So

930
00:57:21,675 --> 00:57:25,285
Speaker 9:  that is not included in the how the tariff multiplier would work.

931
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:29,565
Speaker 9:  And the third thing is that I actually did recently meet someone who might

932
00:57:29,565 --> 00:57:33,405
Speaker 9:  be able to move some of the parts into their, their spot in Wisconsin

933
00:57:33,555 --> 00:57:36,845
Speaker 9:  with very competitive prices. So I'm getting samples there.

934
00:57:37,525 --> 00:57:40,965
Speaker 9:  I think that's pretty unusual. I was kind of amazed, like there's a lot,

935
00:57:40,985 --> 00:57:44,925
Speaker 9:  not a lot of PCB manufacturers in the US people talk about how, I

936
00:57:44,925 --> 00:57:48,895
Speaker 9:  think like star link's, SpaceX stuff is like one

937
00:57:48,895 --> 00:57:52,535
Speaker 9:  of the biggest PCB facilities. But in terms of just quick low volume

938
00:57:53,515 --> 00:57:56,695
Speaker 9:  and by low volume, I mean like a thousand to 3000 ish

939
00:57:57,335 --> 00:58:01,215
Speaker 9:  manufacturing for PCBs is not very common. But this guy has given it

940
00:58:01,255 --> 00:58:02,015
Speaker 9:  a go and

941
00:58:03,795 --> 00:58:06,155
Speaker 9:  I thought that was exciting that I might be able to beat that. So all of

942
00:58:06,155 --> 00:58:10,035
Speaker 9:  that together amounts to a smaller increase than you might think based on

943
00:58:10,035 --> 00:58:13,835
Speaker 9:  the 54%, but it's still an increase and I'm making orders of a thousand.

944
00:58:13,895 --> 00:58:17,515
Speaker 9:  And so if it costs 10% more, that's like

945
00:58:17,835 --> 00:58:21,275
Speaker 9:  thousands of less dollars in in profit for me, for each batch of Tuneshine

946
00:58:21,275 --> 00:58:24,985
Speaker 9:  that's coming in. And I, all the

947
00:58:24,985 --> 00:58:28,465
Speaker 9:  indications are that it could still be profitable, but

948
00:58:28,865 --> 00:58:32,575
Speaker 9:  since I've been scaling up in each order of products that I

949
00:58:32,605 --> 00:58:36,055
Speaker 9:  make is bigger than the last and it eats into the profits I've already made.

950
00:58:36,435 --> 00:58:39,535
Speaker 9:  And because I had legal costs associated with filing a patent,

951
00:58:40,165 --> 00:58:40,455
Speaker 9:  then

952
00:58:42,135 --> 00:58:45,375
Speaker 9:  I don't know for sure yet. But it looks like it should still be okay. And

953
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:48,695
Speaker 9:  especially if I can get a little bit more efficient at marketing, which is

954
00:58:48,715 --> 00:58:52,655
Speaker 9:  my second biggest cost after manufacturing, then I could potentially make

955
00:58:52,655 --> 00:58:56,575
Speaker 9:  up for that. So if I'm getting more organic social reach or if I'm doing

956
00:58:56,575 --> 00:59:00,455
Speaker 9:  better pr, then that helps 'cause I'm less reliant on paid

957
00:59:00,455 --> 00:59:02,775
Speaker 9:  marketing channels. So that's kind of how I've been thinking about it.

958
00:59:03,115 --> 00:59:07,015
Speaker 6:  It seems like part of the challenge here is, is the not knowing of it

959
00:59:07,015 --> 00:59:10,775
Speaker 6:  all that like we is even just in the last two months we've, we've gone back

960
00:59:10,775 --> 00:59:13,815
Speaker 6:  and forth so many times and, and like you talk about ordering these parts

961
00:59:13,815 --> 00:59:17,135
Speaker 6:  and like, it, it's not like this is a thing you can do on a sort of day by

962
00:59:17,135 --> 00:59:20,255
Speaker 6:  day basis depending on the the state of the economics of it all right? You're

963
00:59:20,255 --> 00:59:24,165
Speaker 6:  having to make sort of months long decisions at a time, right?

964
00:59:24,565 --> 00:59:28,445
Speaker 6:  Like how do you even do that in a moment like this where everything is up

965
00:59:28,445 --> 00:59:31,165
Speaker 6:  and down from like 15 minutes to 15 minutes?

966
00:59:31,795 --> 00:59:35,525
Speaker 9:  Yeah, I mean the uncertainty is definitely a huge factor. And I think

967
00:59:35,865 --> 00:59:39,805
Speaker 9:  my reading It is that a lot of the stuff

968
00:59:39,805 --> 00:59:43,205
Speaker 9:  that's happening with the stock market is related to uncertainty as much

969
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:46,605
Speaker 9:  as anything else because we just don't know what's going to happen. For me,

970
00:59:47,455 --> 00:59:51,445
Speaker 9:  there are some funny day-to-day things like if I'm getting parts shipped

971
00:59:52,475 --> 00:59:56,245
Speaker 9:  like over the ocean for example, the delivery times can be very

972
00:59:56,245 --> 01:00:00,205
Speaker 9:  unpredictable, but often this is a much cheaper alternative. So

973
01:00:00,325 --> 01:00:04,285
Speaker 9:  I literally had a package that I think like got delivered yesterday

974
01:00:04,585 --> 01:00:07,645
Speaker 9:  and I don't know if the timing perfectly works out, but the tariffs did seem

975
01:00:07,685 --> 01:00:11,405
Speaker 9:  a little high. So I was like, darn. Like if it had just arrived one day

976
01:00:11,405 --> 01:00:14,005
Speaker 9:  earlier, I could have saved like 400 bucks. But

977
01:00:15,835 --> 01:00:19,765
Speaker 9:  what I think about really, like I, I can sort of plan this

978
01:00:19,765 --> 01:00:21,965
Speaker 9:  stuff out, but as I was saying, when you start this stuff, there's so much

979
01:00:21,965 --> 01:00:25,485
Speaker 9:  uncertainty. And I think about the people who are starting Kickstarters

980
01:00:25,905 --> 01:00:29,805
Speaker 9:  and they're trying to make their best guess at

981
01:00:29,805 --> 01:00:33,725
Speaker 9:  whether they have a viable business model because there's kind of a epidemic,

982
01:00:33,905 --> 01:00:37,725
Speaker 9:  I'm sure you've noticed, of people who like raise a bunch of money on Kickstarter

983
01:00:37,725 --> 01:00:40,645
Speaker 9:  and then ultimately realize like, oh, this business doesn't actually work

984
01:00:40,645 --> 01:00:44,245
Speaker 9:  though. And so products lose support. I think there's a much greater risk

985
01:00:44,245 --> 01:00:47,925
Speaker 9:  of that now because you have less certainty about how much money you wanna

986
01:00:47,925 --> 01:00:51,765
Speaker 9:  raise on top of all the uncertainty you already had. Your prices might go

987
01:00:51,765 --> 01:00:55,655
Speaker 9:  up, you, I think it just adds another factor on

988
01:00:55,655 --> 01:00:59,255
Speaker 9:  top of all the other risks starting a business that might make people

989
01:00:59,665 --> 01:01:02,135
Speaker 9:  think twice about whether they want to turn their little

990
01:01:03,505 --> 01:01:07,375
Speaker 9:  home-built DIY or do we know or raspberry pie gadget into a real

991
01:01:07,375 --> 01:01:10,735
Speaker 9:  product, which is a bummer because I would love to see more diversity in

992
01:01:11,015 --> 01:01:14,455
Speaker 9:  hardware, more power to like smaller hardware players to

993
01:01:14,585 --> 01:01:18,575
Speaker 9:  experiment with all these ideas that are out there that aren't really

994
01:01:18,575 --> 01:01:22,055
Speaker 9:  seen as much in a very homogeneous hardware market. That

995
01:01:22,055 --> 01:01:25,935
Speaker 5:  Seems like the important part, right? That you are living a, a

996
01:01:25,935 --> 01:01:28,975
Speaker 5:  version of the American dream where you had a job, you said, I have an opportunity

997
01:01:28,995 --> 01:01:32,455
Speaker 5:  to start a company, I can open the Alibaba app

998
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:36,575
Speaker 5:  and connect with a bunch of suppliers halfway around the world and

999
01:01:36,705 --> 01:01:40,495
Speaker 5:  start a business and now there's a regulatory environment that might make

1000
01:01:40,495 --> 01:01:43,935
Speaker 5:  that surprisingly harder. Do you think you would've started

1001
01:01:43,935 --> 01:01:46,415
Speaker 5:  Tuneshine right now with the tariff uncertainty?

1002
01:01:47,485 --> 01:01:51,455
Speaker 9:  It's hard to say. I might've tried

1003
01:01:51,455 --> 01:01:55,135
Speaker 9:  to price it differently. The way my initial strategy was, was working with

1004
01:01:55,135 --> 01:01:59,075
Speaker 9:  the pricing is that I would read things online that

1005
01:01:59,075 --> 01:02:02,315
Speaker 9:  were basically saying take the price of your materials and multiply that

1006
01:02:02,335 --> 01:02:05,715
Speaker 9:  by four and that's what you should sell it for. I am not doing that,

1007
01:02:06,085 --> 01:02:09,955
Speaker 9:  which has interesting side effects where I basically am very resistant to

1008
01:02:09,955 --> 01:02:12,995
Speaker 9:  selling in retail environments because they

1009
01:02:13,305 --> 01:02:16,835
Speaker 9:  immediately want to buy your product wholesale for half of the sticker price.

1010
01:02:16,975 --> 01:02:20,845
Speaker 9:  And for me, that basically puts me underwater and I can sell direct to

1011
01:02:20,965 --> 01:02:24,375
Speaker 9:  consumer better than that anyway. But when I was first making these, I

1012
01:02:25,005 --> 01:02:28,895
Speaker 9:  kind of had that attitude of like, well, more likely than not,

1013
01:02:28,915 --> 01:02:32,885
Speaker 9:  if these sell, I can get the price down some way. I can

1014
01:02:32,995 --> 01:02:36,165
Speaker 9:  take the time. Once I know that people will buy them for the price that I've

1015
01:02:36,165 --> 01:02:40,005
Speaker 9:  set it at, then I can, maybe I can scale up, maybe I can find a different

1016
01:02:40,245 --> 01:02:43,845
Speaker 9:  supplier, I can get better at this and that. So I,

1017
01:02:44,185 --> 01:02:47,045
Speaker 9:  oh, through that process, I already brought the price down a lot.

1018
01:02:48,155 --> 01:02:51,925
Speaker 9:  It's going back up now, but I honestly,

1019
01:02:51,925 --> 01:02:55,085
Speaker 9:  like since I came from the software world, I'm not so certain that I would've

1020
01:02:55,085 --> 01:02:57,885
Speaker 9:  had the, the foresight anyway to be able to

1021
01:02:58,715 --> 01:03:02,365
Speaker 9:  incorporate this into the overall calculations. I was just sort of thinking,

1022
01:03:02,385 --> 01:03:05,365
Speaker 9:  all right, I'm gonna start small, I'm gonna sell 50, then I'm gonna sell

1023
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:09,245
Speaker 9:  100 and then 200 500,000 price comes

1024
01:03:09,245 --> 01:03:12,445
Speaker 9:  down a little bit each time and we're getting more and more into healthy

1025
01:03:12,805 --> 01:03:15,965
Speaker 9:  business territory where I can look ahead in the next year and be like, yeah,

1026
01:03:15,965 --> 01:03:19,645
Speaker 9:  this is probably gonna work. But as I said before,

1027
01:03:19,645 --> 01:03:22,725
Speaker 9:  there's so much uncertainty with these things. Having another thing thrown

1028
01:03:22,725 --> 01:03:26,645
Speaker 9:  into the mix does not, I think make it more likely that people will

1029
01:03:27,185 --> 01:03:28,805
Speaker 9:  try experiments like this. Why

1030
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:32,605
Speaker 6:  Not just throw it in and raise the price? I mean, I think we're gonna see

1031
01:03:32,645 --> 01:03:35,525
Speaker 6:  a lot of people who are just like, ah, tariffs, everything's more expensive.

1032
01:03:35,785 --> 01:03:36,405
Speaker 6:  Why not do that?

1033
01:03:36,995 --> 01:03:40,605
Speaker 9:  It's a good question. I think.

1034
01:03:42,165 --> 01:03:45,765
Speaker 9:  I think part of It is just the fact that I'm somewhat new to this and

1035
01:03:46,165 --> 01:03:49,925
Speaker 9:  I am, I think I may be a little bit more nervous than many people would be

1036
01:03:50,095 --> 01:03:53,765
Speaker 9:  about my customer's loyalty. I thought about that when I was

1037
01:03:53,765 --> 01:03:57,085
Speaker 9:  switching to manufacturing outside the house and I did get people who emailed

1038
01:03:57,085 --> 01:04:00,325
Speaker 9:  me who were saying, oh, this is a bummer. Do you actually have any that you

1039
01:04:00,325 --> 01:04:03,845
Speaker 9:  still made with your own hands that I can get? Like I, like literally somebody

1040
01:04:03,845 --> 01:04:06,925
Speaker 9:  asked me to like sign one, which was funny, but, and send it out to him.

1041
01:04:08,585 --> 01:04:11,325
Speaker 9:  So I, I do stress a little bit about customer loyalty.

1042
01:04:12,925 --> 01:04:16,725
Speaker 9:  I think I've done a pretty good job of building that, but by just trying

1043
01:04:16,725 --> 01:04:20,445
Speaker 9:  to be really transparent, talking about how this process works, trying to

1044
01:04:20,445 --> 01:04:24,285
Speaker 9:  be like the opposite of whatever corporate sheen you usually get from

1045
01:04:24,285 --> 01:04:28,125
Speaker 9:  marketing communications. So maybe I've built up an up goodwill where people

1046
01:04:28,445 --> 01:04:32,365
Speaker 9:  would say, hey, like, yeah, this is still fine. On the

1047
01:04:32,365 --> 01:04:36,285
Speaker 9:  other hand, I get some repeat customers, but not a ton. And

1048
01:04:36,285 --> 01:04:40,045
Speaker 9:  so those people I wouldn't necessarily have built up that loyalty to.

1049
01:04:40,145 --> 01:04:43,965
Speaker 9:  So I mean, coming from a big, I used to work@change.org

1050
01:04:43,965 --> 01:04:47,525
Speaker 9:  where we would just ab test everything. It's a little harder to ab test a

1051
01:04:47,525 --> 01:04:51,325
Speaker 9:  price. I kind of wish I could do that even though it's maybe a little ethically

1052
01:04:51,525 --> 01:04:55,365
Speaker 9:  questionable, but I, at least for

1053
01:04:55,465 --> 01:04:59,405
Speaker 9:  now, I wanna try it out. I think that 200 as a starting price,

1054
01:04:59,715 --> 01:05:02,725
Speaker 9:  it's already a somewhat expensive gadget. It's a very niche thing. I'm not

1055
01:05:02,725 --> 01:05:06,485
Speaker 9:  pretending this is like a toaster or a microwave oven or anything. It's,

1056
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:09,645
Speaker 9:  it's a art art piece basically that you can get from your home or not.

1057
01:05:11,505 --> 01:05:15,445
Speaker 9:  200 is I think a, a pretty fair price, but it is a

1058
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:18,485
Speaker 9:  bit high. And so I wanna keep it there and

1059
01:05:19,555 --> 01:05:21,165
Speaker 9:  hope that it works out. Basically.

1060
01:05:21,565 --> 01:05:24,485
Speaker 5:  I think I bought a walnut one that you actually did make by yourself. You

1061
01:05:24,485 --> 01:05:28,205
Speaker 5:  said two things that are really interesting to me. One, you

1062
01:05:28,205 --> 01:05:32,165
Speaker 5:  said American, European manufacturers kind of don't respond, they're just

1063
01:05:32,165 --> 01:05:35,525
Speaker 5:  like not in the game the way that the Chinese supply chain is just in the

1064
01:05:35,525 --> 01:05:39,005
Speaker 5:  game all the time. And then you said there's a guy in Wisconsin who might

1065
01:05:39,005 --> 01:05:42,845
Speaker 5:  be in the game. Now the point of the tariffs is to get you to move

1066
01:05:42,845 --> 01:05:46,365
Speaker 5:  your production to Wisconsin, right? The point of the tariffs is to get more

1067
01:05:46,365 --> 01:05:50,085
Speaker 5:  of the supply chain in the United States. Do you see that happening,

1068
01:05:50,085 --> 01:05:53,445
Speaker 5:  right? I mean you obviously have at least one person in Wisconsin who wants

1069
01:05:53,445 --> 01:05:57,325
Speaker 5:  to help you out. Do you see more of that? Is that ecosystem actually developing?

1070
01:05:57,645 --> 01:05:57,765
Speaker 5:  I,

1071
01:05:57,985 --> 01:06:01,885
Speaker 9:  My experience with this is somewhat limited, but the,

1072
01:06:02,585 --> 01:06:06,045
Speaker 9:  as you said, the the Chinese supply chain is just so well set up for this

1073
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:09,885
Speaker 9:  stuff. There is absolutely no American answer

1074
01:06:09,885 --> 01:06:13,645
Speaker 9:  for Alibaba and just how easy it makes the overall process.

1075
01:06:13,895 --> 01:06:17,125
Speaker 9:  Maybe there are individual suppliers out there that

1076
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:21,965
Speaker 9:  can compete on price, especially with the tariffs and maybe they do

1077
01:06:21,965 --> 01:06:25,725
Speaker 9:  respond, but having everything so streamlined,

1078
01:06:25,945 --> 01:06:29,765
Speaker 9:  it feels like you're kind of going back to the previous century when

1079
01:06:30,025 --> 01:06:34,005
Speaker 9:  you are trying to do things with the American, American manufacturers. It's

1080
01:06:34,005 --> 01:06:37,645
Speaker 9:  not outta the question that maybe someone's out there trying to build the

1081
01:06:37,885 --> 01:06:41,645
Speaker 9:  American Alibaba. That would be awesome. Like if, if, if

1082
01:06:41,645 --> 01:06:45,085
Speaker 9:  someone's out there and feels that spark, you have my full encouragement.

1083
01:06:45,825 --> 01:06:49,405
Speaker 9:  But there's a lot of stuff that's also just not made here. I mean the

1084
01:06:49,525 --> 01:06:53,445
Speaker 9:  ESP 32 microcontroller that I use, it's just a, it's a Chinese

1085
01:06:53,445 --> 01:06:54,285
Speaker 9:  company. Like

1086
01:06:56,305 --> 01:07:00,085
Speaker 9:  May, you know, maybe something using the TSMC factory in Arizona or

1087
01:07:00,445 --> 01:07:04,125
Speaker 9:  wherever that is, is, is gonna come up and make a competitor to that. But

1088
01:07:04,825 --> 01:07:08,485
Speaker 9:  how long does that take? How long does it take to build the ecosystem of

1089
01:07:08,835 --> 01:07:12,645
Speaker 9:  libraries that support this operating system and, and all of this

1090
01:07:12,645 --> 01:07:16,045
Speaker 9:  stuff. I think some people make these LED screens in the us

1091
01:07:16,475 --> 01:07:19,645
Speaker 9:  they don't have pricing on their website. It's a, you know, it's one of a

1092
01:07:19,645 --> 01:07:21,245
Speaker 9:  contact us for sales sort of deals.

1093
01:07:23,315 --> 01:07:26,495
Speaker 9:  But it's, it's lots, lots of obstacles because

1094
01:07:27,805 --> 01:07:31,695
Speaker 9:  they just really have a system for this that's

1095
01:07:31,695 --> 01:07:33,135
Speaker 9:  modern in, in a way that we do not.

1096
01:07:33,275 --> 01:07:35,495
Speaker 5:  How long do you think it would take to, to build that system here? I

1097
01:07:35,495 --> 01:07:38,815
Speaker 9:  Don't know that I would say that's outta my wheelhouse, but certainly,

1098
01:07:39,635 --> 01:07:43,415
Speaker 9:  almost certainly longer than a single presidential term for, for one.

1099
01:07:44,495 --> 01:07:46,495
Speaker 5:  I ask that question because I think that's the answer. Go ahead dude.

1100
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:49,095
Speaker 6:  Well I was gonna say the Alibaba of it all I think is really fascinating

1101
01:07:49,095 --> 01:07:52,535
Speaker 6:  and is is a piece of this that I think is not getting talked about a lot.

1102
01:07:52,605 --> 01:07:56,415
Speaker 6:  That It is that this, It is just so much easier and

1103
01:07:56,415 --> 01:07:59,255
Speaker 6:  faster and more straightforward to do the kind of stuff you're talking about

1104
01:08:00,075 --> 01:08:04,055
Speaker 6:  on Alibaba and in China than just about anywhere else. So I, I

1105
01:08:04,215 --> 01:08:08,015
Speaker 6:  am curious like where that puts you sort of

1106
01:08:08,085 --> 01:08:12,015
Speaker 6:  long term, like let's assume the, the tariffs are real. It feels to me like

1107
01:08:12,015 --> 01:08:16,005
Speaker 6:  you have a couple of options. One is like tr hope everybody

1108
01:08:16,005 --> 01:08:19,845
Speaker 6:  moves part production to the US one is like find new parts

1109
01:08:20,315 --> 01:08:24,125
Speaker 6:  that they make in the us or two is just to figure out how to incorporate

1110
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:27,845
Speaker 6:  the costs. Is the answer one of those? Is it some mixture of those?

1111
01:08:28,285 --> 01:08:32,165
Speaker 9:  I think it will be a mixture. I mean I ultimately, the, the PCB

1112
01:08:32,165 --> 01:08:35,565
Speaker 9:  people in Wisconsin, I didn't switch to them because I was like, I'm gonna

1113
01:08:35,565 --> 01:08:39,325
Speaker 9:  buy American made, but more because I, I think the contract

1114
01:08:39,325 --> 01:08:42,445
Speaker 9:  manufacturer I was using, I think they were getting PCPs made in India and

1115
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:45,165
Speaker 9:  I actually didn't check how much the terrorists were going up on India, but

1116
01:08:45,165 --> 01:08:49,045
Speaker 9:  I think they were 10%. But still I switched because they were able to be

1117
01:08:49,045 --> 01:08:52,685
Speaker 9:  the cost w when they incorporated shipping and when they incorporated

1118
01:08:52,755 --> 01:08:55,645
Speaker 9:  that tariff, they were able to beat the cost. They were also able to make

1119
01:08:55,645 --> 01:08:58,565
Speaker 9:  a 3D printed part and they were down to bundle it together. They were even

1120
01:08:58,565 --> 01:09:02,365
Speaker 9:  down to do some electronics engineering for free

1121
01:09:02,465 --> 01:09:05,405
Speaker 9:  to throw that in, which is huge. 'cause you know, for these

1122
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:10,005
Speaker 9:  500,000 here, that really adds up at, at the point that I'm doing this business.

1123
01:09:10,305 --> 01:09:14,165
Speaker 9:  So I think it'll be a mix and maybe I, I just kind of put a call out on my

1124
01:09:14,165 --> 01:09:17,805
Speaker 9:  Instagram and TikTok where I was saying, Hey, if you know people in the US

1125
01:09:17,805 --> 01:09:21,325
Speaker 9:  who might be able to do this, like sure I'm open to it, but I haven't seen

1126
01:09:21,325 --> 01:09:25,205
Speaker 9:  that. I mean I used to be getting cardboard boxes

1127
01:09:25,635 --> 01:09:28,125
Speaker 9:  with foam that just protected during shipping

1128
01:09:29,455 --> 01:09:32,165
Speaker 9:  price in the US $18, China four.

1129
01:09:33,265 --> 01:09:37,245
Speaker 9:  Wow. Like, so that's, that's 350% more. I would be

1130
01:09:37,245 --> 01:09:39,485
Speaker 9:  a bit surprised, but it doesn't mean it's not out there.

1131
01:09:41,075 --> 01:09:44,015
Speaker 9:  The other thing is that I just, by the nature of my business, I think I do

1132
01:09:44,015 --> 01:09:47,815
Speaker 9:  have a little bit more flexibility. I don't have people on

1133
01:09:47,815 --> 01:09:50,735
Speaker 9:  payroll yet. I'm not even on payroll yet, hopefully, hopefully this year.

1134
01:09:50,915 --> 01:09:54,175
Speaker 9:  But I don't have people on payroll. I like if you're Apple

1135
01:09:54,795 --> 01:09:58,015
Speaker 9:  and they'll probably maybe be able to get some exemptions. But like this,

1136
01:09:58,035 --> 01:10:01,895
Speaker 9:  you know, if It is a 10% or 20% increase in your, the price

1137
01:10:01,895 --> 01:10:02,535
Speaker 9:  for your items,

1138
01:10:04,205 --> 01:10:07,975
Speaker 9:  that is like billions of dollars. That's, it represents

1139
01:10:07,975 --> 01:10:11,495
Speaker 9:  tons, tons of people's jobs and, and entire big

1140
01:10:11,495 --> 01:10:15,215
Speaker 9:  corporate strategy Ocean liner that needs to be turned.

1141
01:10:15,605 --> 01:10:19,535
Speaker 9:  Whereas for me, I do, I do have a bit more flexibility because It is just

1142
01:10:19,535 --> 01:10:23,455
Speaker 9:  me. And so I don't have to fire people because of a

1143
01:10:23,455 --> 01:10:27,175
Speaker 9:  10% price increase, which is great. Maybe it means that I'm

1144
01:10:28,895 --> 01:10:32,695
Speaker 9:  skipping on the, the fancy four pack of beer and instead drinking Pacifico

1145
01:10:32,775 --> 01:10:36,695
Speaker 9:  a little more. But the, it's it's more flexibility. Yeah.

1146
01:10:37,995 --> 01:10:40,335
Speaker 5:  Tim Cook switching to Pacifico is actually the most obvious.

1147
01:10:42,205 --> 01:10:42,575
Speaker 5:  Just put

1148
01:10:42,575 --> 01:10:43,495
Speaker 9:  This first thought,

1149
01:10:44,075 --> 01:10:47,415
Speaker 5:  Put this in a range for me, right? There's Terrace went up and

1150
01:10:47,745 --> 01:10:51,375
Speaker 5:  maybe your costs go up 10% and you're drinking sadly some cheaper beer

1151
01:10:51,775 --> 01:10:55,175
Speaker 5:  and that's fine. And then what's the number that says this is no longer

1152
01:10:55,175 --> 01:10:55,775
Speaker 5:  sustainable?

1153
01:10:57,645 --> 01:11:01,465
Speaker 9:  I mean, if, if my manufactured cost

1154
01:11:01,495 --> 01:11:05,025
Speaker 9:  went over a hundred dollars, that's sorta, that's kind of

1155
01:11:05,535 --> 01:11:08,865
Speaker 9:  game over. I mean it's certainly without raising the price, I don't know.

1156
01:11:08,865 --> 01:11:12,665
Speaker 9:  Maybe there is a market like maybe, you know, maybe in a couple months people

1157
01:11:12,665 --> 01:11:15,525
Speaker 9:  will be be like, well like my TV was like

1158
01:11:16,235 --> 01:11:20,165
Speaker 9:  $900 and it used to be 400. So a Tuneshine for two 50

1159
01:11:20,235 --> 01:11:24,165
Speaker 9:  doesn't actually seem so crazy. But for if it

1160
01:11:24,165 --> 01:11:27,725
Speaker 9:  were over a hundred dollars, I I would be very surprised if people would

1161
01:11:27,725 --> 01:11:29,845
Speaker 9:  be able to pay what would make sense

1162
01:11:31,785 --> 01:11:35,645
Speaker 9:  to, to make that sustainable. Certainly with retail, 'cause I, if

1163
01:11:35,685 --> 01:11:39,525
Speaker 9:  I kept it at 200 and I'm paying a hundred, I literally would make zero on

1164
01:11:39,525 --> 01:11:43,445
Speaker 9:  each retail sale unless I get like a good deal. I, I'm only in one store

1165
01:11:43,445 --> 01:11:46,565
Speaker 9:  right now and she's sort of a friend of a friend and she gives me a little

1166
01:11:46,565 --> 01:11:50,325
Speaker 9:  bit more than 50% of the cost. But like if I'm aiming to be in

1167
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:54,485
Speaker 9:  Urban Outfitters someday, I don't think they're gonna cut me a good deal

1168
01:11:54,665 --> 01:11:58,085
Speaker 9:  and that suddenly goes like off the table. I think if, if my manufacturing

1169
01:11:58,095 --> 01:11:59,285
Speaker 9:  costs go over a hundred dollars

1170
01:11:59,655 --> 01:12:02,205
Speaker 5:  Twice, what do you think is next? Fortrend, what are you looking at for

1171
01:12:02,665 --> 01:12:06,245
Speaker 9:  I'm really going for consistency this year. I just placed an order for a

1172
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:10,325
Speaker 9:  thousand, which is my biggest order yet. And now that

1173
01:12:10,385 --> 01:12:14,085
Speaker 9:  the manufacturing and the fulfillment is outta my house, I'm just trying

1174
01:12:14,085 --> 01:12:17,885
Speaker 9:  to get that running on a kind of clockwork basis while I can add new features.

1175
01:12:17,905 --> 01:12:21,125
Speaker 9:  So I really wanna support more home music servers this year.

1176
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:25,925
Speaker 9:  Plex run like Logitech Media server.

1177
01:12:26,185 --> 01:12:29,725
Speaker 9:  People are always emailing me more and more bespoke media servers. I wanna,

1178
01:12:29,925 --> 01:12:32,165
Speaker 9:  I wanna support as many of those as I can.

1179
01:12:33,905 --> 01:12:37,885
Speaker 9:  Trying a special edition, maybe some colors just got some samples

1180
01:12:38,025 --> 01:12:41,645
Speaker 9:  in and maybe a big one, maybe a vinyl record

1181
01:12:41,885 --> 01:12:45,725
Speaker 9:  sized one. So that's, that's, those are the things that are on my mind

1182
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:47,245
Speaker 9:  right now. As soon as

1183
01:12:47,245 --> 01:12:50,325
Speaker 6:  You said ro a bunch of Vergecast listeners started like fist pumping at their

1184
01:12:50,325 --> 01:12:50,445
Speaker 6:  phones.

1185
01:12:50,925 --> 01:12:53,925
Speaker 5:  The Thero and plus audience, here're on The Verge Cha is strong fans. I'm

1186
01:12:54,235 --> 01:12:54,725
Speaker 5:  very excited

1187
01:12:54,795 --> 01:12:56,245
Speaker 9:  Fans, I see you run fans

1188
01:12:56,795 --> 01:12:59,685
Speaker 5:  Well when you make the big one, let me know. Built in microphone for the

1189
01:12:59,685 --> 01:13:01,125
Speaker 5:  Shazam. That's the, that's the

1190
01:13:01,125 --> 01:13:02,725
Speaker 9:  Game. That's that, that's sort of

1191
01:13:03,035 --> 01:13:06,245
Speaker 5:  $5,000 Tuneshine with an AI microphone in It is

1192
01:13:06,245 --> 01:13:08,845
Speaker 9:  What I'm looking for. Yeah, it's got, it's got like eight mics so that it

1193
01:13:08,855 --> 01:13:12,085
Speaker 9:  knows which direction the music comes from for some reason. Why not?

1194
01:13:12,885 --> 01:13:14,805
Speaker 5:  I love it. Tobias, thank you so much for joining the Bird Cast.

1195
01:13:15,015 --> 01:13:16,645
Speaker 9:  Thank you. Really appreciate it. Bye.

1196
01:13:16,945 --> 01:13:19,765
Speaker 5:  All right, we gotta take a break. We're gonna come back lightning round and

1197
01:13:19,835 --> 01:13:22,565
Speaker 5:  America's favorite podcast for the podcast. We'll right back

1198
01:14:55,315 --> 01:14:58,985
Speaker 5:  Alright, we're back. It's a lightning round unsponsored

1199
01:14:59,665 --> 01:15:00,125
Speaker 5:  for flavor.

1200
01:15:00,715 --> 01:15:03,445
Speaker 6:  Does it need an ellipsis? There's been some debate about whether it's

1201
01:15:03,475 --> 01:15:07,185
Speaker 6:  unsponsored.dot for flavor or if it's just

1202
01:15:07,185 --> 01:15:08,225
Speaker 6:  unsponsored for flavor.

1203
01:15:08,725 --> 01:15:12,665
Speaker 5:  So I don't know. You, you tell me. Yeah, I will tell you that we,

1204
01:15:12,765 --> 01:15:16,065
Speaker 5:  the decoder tagline, which is big ideas and other problems

1205
01:15:16,805 --> 01:15:20,785
Speaker 5:  is impossible to say tagline. Like, it looks really good

1206
01:15:21,135 --> 01:15:24,865
Speaker 5:  with that built-in ellipsis, right? Big ideas. And then every

1207
01:15:24,865 --> 01:15:28,825
Speaker 5:  week I say it, I'm like, this sucks. So I

1208
01:15:28,825 --> 01:15:32,265
Speaker 5:  might just be having like, it's hard to say, you try saying it.

1209
01:15:32,605 --> 01:15:35,425
Speaker 5:  So I might just be having a response to that ellipsis.

1210
01:15:36,355 --> 01:15:40,045
Speaker 5:  Like, I think the, the pregnant pause is like good, right?

1211
01:15:40,195 --> 01:15:43,685
Speaker 5:  It's unsponsored for what flavor. Like that makes sense to me. But I don't

1212
01:15:43,685 --> 01:15:45,285
Speaker 5:  know that you wanna formally you tell me

1213
01:15:45,285 --> 01:15:49,125
Speaker 6:  Maybe it's like big unsponsored little for

1214
01:15:49,125 --> 01:15:51,565
Speaker 6:  flavor that maybe that that's kind of, that's the vibe.

1215
01:15:51,565 --> 01:15:55,365
Speaker 5:  We, again, the reason I keep saying It is to cement in the listener's

1216
01:15:55,435 --> 01:15:58,805
Speaker 5:  mind the idea that if something is sponsored, it lacks flavor,

1217
01:15:59,575 --> 01:16:03,325
Speaker 5:  which is the entire media now is just branded content deals,

1218
01:16:04,485 --> 01:16:08,355
Speaker 5:  right? It's just everything is sponsored or paid for. And I

1219
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:11,795
Speaker 5:  just want you to think every time you think, see that you just think they,

1220
01:16:12,225 --> 01:16:13,435
Speaker 5:  there's less flavor here.

1221
01:16:13,945 --> 01:16:17,235
Speaker 6:  It's good. It's also a way to make sure that this show never makes any money

1222
01:16:17,625 --> 01:16:19,795
Speaker 6:  ever again. So we we're doing great,

1223
01:16:21,415 --> 01:16:23,075
Speaker 5:  But we don't lack for flavor.

1224
01:16:23,205 --> 01:16:27,195
Speaker 5:  David Richard just sighing. He is

1225
01:16:27,195 --> 01:16:28,195
Speaker 5:  like, what have I signed up for?

1226
01:16:30,345 --> 01:16:31,085
Speaker 5:  All right, it's time.

1227
01:16:31,825 --> 01:16:35,125
Speaker 6:  Oh my goodness. Richard, have you, have you been here for this yet? America's

1228
01:16:35,435 --> 01:16:38,565
Speaker 6:  it's a top two podcast within, within a podcast. Again, I keep getting emails

1229
01:16:38,775 --> 01:16:41,925
Speaker 6:  about Munch Squad on my brother, my brother and me and I, and trust me, I

1230
01:16:41,925 --> 01:16:45,885
Speaker 6:  hear you. I love it too. But it's time for America's other favorite

1231
01:16:45,915 --> 01:16:49,525
Speaker 6:  podcast. In their podcast. Brendan Carr is a dummy.

1232
01:16:50,685 --> 01:16:51,755
Speaker 6:  We're so bad. It is my first

1233
01:16:51,775 --> 01:16:51,995
Speaker 5:  One.

1234
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:55,705
Speaker 6:  It's honestly, I'm thrilled for you. And this is the part where we just sort

1235
01:16:55,705 --> 01:16:58,585
Speaker 6:  of sit quietly and Neli talks for like an hour and a half. It's great. It's

1236
01:16:58,585 --> 01:16:59,345
Speaker 6:  my favorite brother. The show.

1237
01:17:00,425 --> 01:17:03,625
Speaker 5:  People have asked me if I, I write these and the answer is no. I just start

1238
01:17:03,625 --> 01:17:07,505
Speaker 5:  yelling. And that's, that's how much it builds up with me within me

1239
01:17:07,505 --> 01:17:11,365
Speaker 5:  week after week. Alright, this week on Brendan Carr is a dummy. Two things.

1240
01:17:11,985 --> 01:17:14,805
Speaker 5:  One last week we pointed out that he's threatening all kinds of companies

1241
01:17:14,805 --> 01:17:18,245
Speaker 5:  that he will investigate them and not let them do deals unless they cancel

1242
01:17:18,245 --> 01:17:22,105
Speaker 5:  their DEI programs because he just

1243
01:17:22,105 --> 01:17:25,945
Speaker 5:  likes making threats. And so this week T-Mobile closed a deal with a

1244
01:17:25,945 --> 01:17:28,545
Speaker 5:  fiber company called Lumos. They're doing a joint venture roll at fiber,

1245
01:17:28,965 --> 01:17:32,945
Speaker 5:  but only after it dropped all of its DEI

1246
01:17:32,945 --> 01:17:36,865
Speaker 5:  pages. This is the dumbest story in the world. T-Mobile had

1247
01:17:36,865 --> 01:17:39,745
Speaker 5:  a bunch of pages up that outlined quote, a culture of fairness, respect,

1248
01:17:39,745 --> 01:17:42,905
Speaker 5:  and inclusion. They were online until March 26th. They took 'em down,

1249
01:17:43,455 --> 01:17:44,145
Speaker 5:  deal got approved,

1250
01:17:45,655 --> 01:17:47,785
Speaker 5:  bing, bang, boom, we're we're close.

1251
01:17:48,085 --> 01:17:51,865
Speaker 7:  And, and because this is the current world in Mrs. Printed car, the

1252
01:17:51,865 --> 01:17:55,745
Speaker 7:  pages, they changed the pages. They don't say

1253
01:17:55,825 --> 01:17:59,185
Speaker 7:  DEI anymore. They're the URL that said D Diversity

1254
01:17:59,735 --> 01:18:03,585
Speaker 7:  gone. Many of the groups that were listed that championed

1255
01:18:03,585 --> 01:18:07,145
Speaker 7:  diversity gone, but they're just kind of different pages.

1256
01:18:08,075 --> 01:18:09,605
Speaker 7:  They just moved them good enough for bridging car.

1257
01:18:10,035 --> 01:18:13,565
Speaker 6:  They say stronger together now instead of diversity and inclusion,

1258
01:18:13,775 --> 01:18:17,445
Speaker 6:  which literally all that does is it doesn't get caught in

1259
01:18:17,925 --> 01:18:21,725
Speaker 6:  whatever scraper the AI tool is doing on their website. Like what we've learned

1260
01:18:21,725 --> 01:18:25,245
Speaker 6:  about Doge is that Doge is just like running a bunch of, of

1261
01:18:25,585 --> 01:18:29,365
Speaker 6:  AI checks to see, like when they use words like probation and

1262
01:18:29,365 --> 01:18:33,005
Speaker 6:  diversity and like trans anything,

1263
01:18:34,385 --> 01:18:36,845
Speaker 6:  and th this is the same kind of thing. They're like, oh, we're just gonna

1264
01:18:36,845 --> 01:18:39,845
Speaker 6:  4 0 4 a couple of webpage, we're gonna don't, don't look over here at these

1265
01:18:40,035 --> 01:18:43,685
Speaker 6:  webpage, which are different because they say

1266
01:18:44,045 --> 01:18:47,885
Speaker 6:  together and not inclusion. So it's fine. This is

1267
01:18:47,885 --> 01:18:51,045
Speaker 6:  the level of stupidity we have reached to. And apparently it worked for Brenda

1268
01:18:51,045 --> 01:18:51,405
Speaker 6:  and Carr

1269
01:18:51,875 --> 01:18:52,365
Speaker 7:  Segment

1270
01:18:52,365 --> 01:18:55,525
Speaker 5:  Called Car Dny. I wanna be very clear about this David. And

1271
01:18:55,525 --> 01:18:58,365
Speaker 6:  It works. That's the worst part. That that's all he, that's all Brenda and

1272
01:18:58,365 --> 01:18:58,885
Speaker 6:  Carr wanted.

1273
01:18:59,435 --> 01:19:02,485
Speaker 5:  It's true. The trans continental railroad is woke now that's, that's what

1274
01:19:02,485 --> 01:19:05,685
Speaker 5:  you need to take away from this. You know I'm right. You know, that's how

1275
01:19:05,685 --> 01:19:09,045
Speaker 5:  it's going. So that's one that happened, right? And that's just naked

1276
01:19:09,215 --> 01:19:12,965
Speaker 5:  corruption of the, the dumbest kind. Like there's,

1277
01:19:12,965 --> 01:19:15,965
Speaker 5:  they're just stupid. But it worked. And that's just the nature of corruption.

1278
01:19:16,505 --> 01:19:20,405
Speaker 5:  And am I saying that telecom companies aren't inherently kind of stupid

1279
01:19:20,425 --> 01:19:23,125
Speaker 5:  and corrupt? I'm not saying that I believe telecom companies are inherently

1280
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:26,485
Speaker 5:  kind of stupid and corrupt. And whether it's promising

1281
01:19:26,945 --> 01:19:30,685
Speaker 5:  the chairman of the FCC that upon leaving, he will get a plumb job as

1282
01:19:30,685 --> 01:19:33,485
Speaker 5:  president of the lobbying organization for our nation's wireless carriers.

1283
01:19:33,575 --> 01:19:37,045
Speaker 5:  Which is a real thing that it just recently happened to a G Pi or saying

1284
01:19:37,045 --> 01:19:40,365
Speaker 5:  we're gonna remove the word diversity and replace it with the words stronger

1285
01:19:40,645 --> 01:19:43,725
Speaker 5:  together. It's all just corruption and that's fine, stupid,

1286
01:19:44,845 --> 01:19:48,635
Speaker 5:  a little bit racist, but the sort of corruption we're, we're used to. Then

1287
01:19:48,635 --> 01:19:52,395
Speaker 5:  there's Brendan just saying things that are demonstrably

1288
01:19:52,895 --> 01:19:56,795
Speaker 5:  untrue in ways that are quite honestly easy to check. So this

1289
01:19:56,795 --> 01:20:00,315
Speaker 5:  week the Democrats on the Energy and Commerce Committee in the House of Representatives

1290
01:20:00,705 --> 01:20:04,155
Speaker 5:  said they were very concerned about Brendan's general sensor

1291
01:20:04,875 --> 01:20:08,765
Speaker 5:  attitude and they wanted an investigation. So ranking member Frank

1292
01:20:08,765 --> 01:20:12,485
Speaker 5:  Palone from New Jersey ranking member Doris Matsui from

1293
01:20:12,485 --> 01:20:15,805
Speaker 5:  California and Yvette Clark from New York wrote a letter

1294
01:20:16,265 --> 01:20:19,725
Speaker 5:  to Brendan saying, we write to express deep concern over your actions to

1295
01:20:19,725 --> 01:20:23,205
Speaker 5:  target and intimidate news organizations and broadcasters in violation of

1296
01:20:23,205 --> 01:20:26,605
Speaker 5:  the First Amendment. These troubling actions assault the

1297
01:20:26,845 --> 01:20:30,725
Speaker 5:  constitutionally protected freedom of the press and violate the FCC statutory

1298
01:20:30,965 --> 01:20:34,885
Speaker 5:  prohibition against engaging in censorship. Directing FCC staff to devote

1299
01:20:34,885 --> 01:20:38,565
Speaker 5:  time and resources to bogus investigations constitutes a violation of the

1300
01:20:38,585 --> 01:20:42,565
Speaker 5:  law. Gross mismanagement, extreme waste of funds, and an abuse of

1301
01:20:42,565 --> 01:20:42,965
Speaker 5:  authority.

1302
01:20:43,405 --> 01:20:46,565
Speaker 6:  I just wanna point out that this, that's what it sounds like when you write

1303
01:20:46,565 --> 01:20:49,805
Speaker 6:  it Neli is what it sounds like when you just yell at into a microphone. I'm

1304
01:20:49,805 --> 01:20:51,925
Speaker 6:  very mad at that. It's the same thing. They're just saying the same stuff

1305
01:20:51,925 --> 01:20:52,525
Speaker 6:  you've been saying.

1306
01:20:52,845 --> 01:20:56,165
Speaker 5:  It's all, it's the same thing. It's all the same stuff. So they shared a

1307
01:20:56,165 --> 01:20:59,445
Speaker 5:  letter at the Office of Inspector General and they are asking for an investigation

1308
01:20:59,445 --> 01:21:03,335
Speaker 5:  into Brendan, okay, branch the, the

1309
01:21:03,445 --> 01:21:07,295
Speaker 5:  re's fighting. Brendan is furious about this Oliver

1310
01:21:07,425 --> 01:21:11,255
Speaker 5:  Darcy at Status who is doing an amazing job reporting on Brendan Carr, I

1311
01:21:11,255 --> 01:21:14,495
Speaker 5:  should say, and often gets comments back from Brendan, which is

1312
01:21:14,935 --> 01:21:18,455
Speaker 5:  fascinating, asked Brendan about this. And Carr in response

1313
01:21:18,805 --> 01:21:22,735
Speaker 5:  accused the Democrats of weaponizing the country's

1314
01:21:22,975 --> 01:21:26,895
Speaker 5:  communications laws against Republicans, which is wild

1315
01:21:27,325 --> 01:21:30,655
Speaker 5:  because he is the one being accused of weaponizing the communications laws.

1316
01:21:30,675 --> 01:21:34,455
Speaker 5:  And in response he's saying, even asking you about this and saying, I'm injuring

1317
01:21:34,455 --> 01:21:37,295
Speaker 5:  the First amendment is weaponizing those laws. And then he points out in

1318
01:21:37,295 --> 01:21:41,095
Speaker 5:  classic Brendan car fashion and then he claims in classic

1319
01:21:41,095 --> 01:21:44,495
Speaker 5:  Brendan car fashion that everything he's doing is fine. 'cause he thinks

1320
01:21:44,495 --> 01:21:48,175
Speaker 5:  the Democrats who proceeded him were doing it worse. So he says, if your

1321
01:21:48,175 --> 01:21:52,095
Speaker 5:  last name was Soros, you got special streamlined treatment on an

1322
01:21:52,095 --> 01:21:55,695
Speaker 5:  expedited basis by the previous FCC. If your last name was Musk,

1323
01:21:55,845 --> 01:21:59,215
Speaker 5:  then you got millions of dollars worth of awards revoked for partisan

1324
01:21:59,245 --> 01:22:02,935
Speaker 5:  political reasons. If you were a conservative outlet, then your FEC

1325
01:22:02,935 --> 01:22:06,295
Speaker 5:  licenses and distribution deals were held up or subject to government backed

1326
01:22:06,295 --> 01:22:09,815
Speaker 5:  cancel campaigns. This is what, this is demonstrably untrue, like

1327
01:22:10,185 --> 01:22:12,815
Speaker 5:  fully and completely untrue because one,

1328
01:22:14,075 --> 01:22:17,735
Speaker 5:  if the, if your complaint is that the previous administration was corrupt

1329
01:22:17,795 --> 01:22:21,095
Speaker 5:  and politically motivated and biased unfair, that does not mean that you

1330
01:22:21,095 --> 01:22:24,495
Speaker 5:  should do it too. It just doesn't, it means you should be better. It's actually

1331
01:22:24,495 --> 01:22:26,695
Speaker 6:  An admission of guilt. It's says I

1332
01:22:26,755 --> 01:22:30,135
Speaker 5:  Too am corrupt. You're saying these people were evil so I'm gonna do the

1333
01:22:30,135 --> 01:22:34,095
Speaker 5:  same stuff. Yeah, that's bad, right? That that just makes you a fluky of

1334
01:22:34,095 --> 01:22:38,075
Speaker 5:  a different stripe, but you're still a fluky second,

1335
01:22:38,735 --> 01:22:42,275
Speaker 5:  the, if your last name was Musk and your licenses got revoked,

1336
01:22:42,335 --> 01:22:45,515
Speaker 5:  that's because starlink was trying to defraud the government into getting

1337
01:22:45,515 --> 01:22:48,715
Speaker 5:  grants by saying it would provide service to like shopping malls.

1338
01:22:49,445 --> 01:22:52,135
Speaker 5:  Like they were, they were making fake maps. You can read, it's on our site.

1339
01:22:52,135 --> 01:22:55,375
Speaker 5:  We covered all of this. Ours, Technica covered all of this in detail.

1340
01:22:55,955 --> 01:22:59,415
Speaker 5:  The reason starlink wasn't getting awards for these rural broadband programs

1341
01:22:59,555 --> 01:23:03,375
Speaker 5:  is 'cause they were saying they were gonna cover densely populated suburbs

1342
01:23:03,375 --> 01:23:07,005
Speaker 5:  with shopping malls in them, not rural America, which starlink cannot do.

1343
01:23:07,675 --> 01:23:10,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I don't, it doesn't even matter if they can or can't do it. They were

1344
01:23:10,445 --> 01:23:13,445
Speaker 5:  looking at the maps and saying, no, that's not correct. Right? This is not

1345
01:23:13,445 --> 01:23:17,405
Speaker 5:  what you should be doing. So then Carr goes on to say, for those that

1346
01:23:17,405 --> 01:23:20,485
Speaker 5:  have benefited from the two-tiered system of justice that prevailed during

1347
01:23:20,485 --> 01:23:24,365
Speaker 5:  the Biden years, even handed mist may feel like discrimination,

1348
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:28,605
Speaker 5:  but that does not make it. So this is also just

1349
01:23:28,975 --> 01:23:32,725
Speaker 5:  fully warped thinking, right? If you think that there was a two tiered

1350
01:23:32,725 --> 01:23:36,005
Speaker 5:  system of justice during the Biden administration, you don't pull the pendulum

1351
01:23:36,005 --> 01:23:39,365
Speaker 5:  back by investigating broadcast outlets in violation of First Amendment.

1352
01:23:39,835 --> 01:23:43,685
Speaker 5:  That is absolutely wrong. It is just, It is

1353
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:47,165
Speaker 5:  censorious, it, it goes against the American system of justice.

1354
01:23:47,945 --> 01:23:51,645
Speaker 5:  And It is so outside the realm of authority for the FCC that

1355
01:23:52,105 --> 01:23:55,325
Speaker 5:  it, it like boggles the mind that I talk about it every week. This is not

1356
01:23:55,325 --> 01:23:58,085
Speaker 5:  what you want the Federal Communications Commission doing. You do not want

1357
01:23:58,115 --> 01:24:01,805
Speaker 5:  Brendan Carr who is unelected saying that he alone can

1358
01:24:01,805 --> 01:24:05,765
Speaker 5:  control what is distributed over the airwaves because he understands

1359
01:24:05,765 --> 01:24:08,765
Speaker 5:  what the public interest is and he can reopen investigations that

1360
01:24:09,475 --> 01:24:13,245
Speaker 5:  like many, many, many former FCC chairman and commissioners

1361
01:24:13,435 --> 01:24:16,925
Speaker 5:  from years past have said or inappropriate, this is not what we wanted to.

1362
01:24:17,145 --> 01:24:21,125
Speaker 5:  And then on top of that, I have done a lot of reporting on this over

1363
01:24:21,125 --> 01:24:23,925
Speaker 5:  the years and I know that what he's saying about the Biden administration

1364
01:24:24,065 --> 01:24:27,965
Speaker 5:  is fully bullshit. I know this because the problems in the

1365
01:24:27,965 --> 01:24:31,925
Speaker 5:  Biden administration were that big telecom companies made the

1366
01:24:31,925 --> 01:24:35,365
Speaker 5:  Biden FCC corrupt and ineffective. So it could not

1367
01:24:36,125 --> 01:24:40,005
Speaker 5:  forcibly open up our nation's networks. They could not open

1368
01:24:40,005 --> 01:24:43,695
Speaker 5:  up cable companies, they could not do net neutrality. They could not

1369
01:24:43,795 --> 01:24:47,415
Speaker 5:  get the votes to regulate our systems to make sure that they

1370
01:24:47,415 --> 01:24:51,175
Speaker 5:  respected free speech by being open to all. And in fact, it's not

1371
01:24:51,535 --> 01:24:54,855
Speaker 5:  Republicans or Democrats to prevented this from happening. It is the big

1372
01:24:55,045 --> 01:24:58,455
Speaker 5:  telecom companies that got together and made it

1373
01:24:58,455 --> 01:25:02,055
Speaker 5:  impossible for Biden to nominate Gigi. So to the

1374
01:25:02,175 --> 01:25:05,975
Speaker 5:  FCC completing his commissioners of Democrats so they could pass votes.

1375
01:25:06,635 --> 01:25:09,945
Speaker 5:  We did a whole decoder on this. And in that decoder,

1376
01:25:10,935 --> 01:25:14,035
Speaker 5:  the, the star witness on that episode of decoder, we talked to a ton of people,

1377
01:25:14,035 --> 01:25:17,715
Speaker 5:  you can go listen to it. The, the, the star guest was the

1378
01:25:17,835 --> 01:25:18,955
Speaker 5:  CEO of Newsmax

1379
01:25:20,575 --> 01:25:24,515
Speaker 5:  who is not a Democrat. Chris Ruddy, the CEO of Newsmax is, I'm telling you,

1380
01:25:24,515 --> 01:25:27,795
Speaker 5:  this man is not a democrat. We, we are not aligned politically on a number

1381
01:25:27,795 --> 01:25:31,635
Speaker 5:  of things. But he came onto our show and said the

1382
01:25:31,635 --> 01:25:34,635
Speaker 5:  problem is the big cable companies

1383
01:25:35,915 --> 01:25:39,415
Speaker 5:  are trying to keep Gigi so out of the SEC

1384
01:25:39,715 --> 01:25:43,575
Speaker 5:  so that there are not votes to open these systems up and actually

1385
01:25:43,575 --> 01:25:47,365
Speaker 5:  protect access here. Let's just run the audit. Here's, here's Chris Ruddy,

1386
01:25:47,385 --> 01:25:51,325
Speaker 5:  the CEO of Newsmax talking to me under coder last year about the

1387
01:25:51,345 --> 01:25:54,605
Speaker 5:  actual problem in the cable industry under the Biden administration.

1388
01:25:54,945 --> 01:25:58,485
Speaker 16:  The cable industry is a bit of a racket and the big

1389
01:25:58,485 --> 01:26:01,885
Speaker 16:  broadcast companies are part of the racket and they benefit it. The people

1390
01:26:01,885 --> 01:26:05,285
Speaker 16:  that get screwed are the consumers, the cable customers.

1391
01:26:06,545 --> 01:26:10,245
Speaker 16:  And so the way the rack works is if you own a lot of

1392
01:26:10,245 --> 01:26:13,565
Speaker 16:  television stations that a local cable company needs your

1393
01:26:13,605 --> 01:26:17,445
Speaker 16:  A-B-C-C-B-S-N-B-C Fox affiliates, they basically

1394
01:26:17,445 --> 01:26:20,925
Speaker 16:  have you over a barrel because if they don't give you your channel, people

1395
01:26:20,925 --> 01:26:23,205
Speaker 16:  are gonna go to another cable system. Right?

1396
01:26:23,715 --> 01:26:27,605
Speaker 5:  What Chris is saying there, and what has been true for years is that if

1397
01:26:27,605 --> 01:26:31,355
Speaker 5:  you are Fox and you want Fox

1398
01:26:31,425 --> 01:26:35,335
Speaker 5:  News on a cable system, you have all of this leverage

1399
01:26:35,335 --> 01:26:38,415
Speaker 5:  because you also have Fox and you have the NFL on Fox.

1400
01:26:40,035 --> 01:26:43,655
Speaker 5:  And so you can go to cable operators like Comcast disclosure,

1401
01:26:43,655 --> 01:26:47,535
Speaker 5:  Comcast is a investor in Fox Media, although they hate the fact that I'm

1402
01:26:47,535 --> 01:26:50,855
Speaker 5:  talking about this and I've been talking about it for a decade. You can go

1403
01:26:50,855 --> 01:26:54,295
Speaker 5:  to Comcast or Spectrum or whoever else and say, do you want the NFL? You

1404
01:26:54,295 --> 01:26:57,655
Speaker 5:  have to pay us a very, very high rate for Fox News two

1405
01:26:58,385 --> 01:27:02,165
Speaker 5:  because if you don't, we're gonna take the NFL away.

1406
01:27:03,285 --> 01:27:07,165
Speaker 5:  A BC does this, you want ESPN, you gotta pay a whole bunch of money for a,

1407
01:27:07,165 --> 01:27:11,005
Speaker 5:  b, C family. They all do it. Comcast does it because they have NBC. There's

1408
01:27:11,005 --> 01:27:14,245
Speaker 5:  a reason they all vertically integrated all of this content 'cause they wanted

1409
01:27:14,245 --> 01:27:18,035
Speaker 5:  to leverage over all the dis distributors. That's the problem

1410
01:27:18,415 --> 01:27:22,115
Speaker 5:  you, so you look at where the alignments are and It is not Republicans and

1411
01:27:22,315 --> 01:27:25,565
Speaker 5:  Democrats. It is big companies and small companies.

1412
01:27:25,905 --> 01:27:29,765
Speaker 5:  That's why Chris Ruddy, CEO of Newsmax supported a very

1413
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:34,005
Speaker 5:  progressive commissioner that was nominated by Biden. 'cause she wanted

1414
01:27:34,005 --> 01:27:37,845
Speaker 5:  to break the control of the big companies. That's why Rupert

1415
01:27:37,875 --> 01:27:41,845
Speaker 5:  Murdoch and all of his empire went to war against that

1416
01:27:41,845 --> 01:27:45,685
Speaker 5:  same commissioner of the SEC and made sure her nomination to go

1417
01:27:45,685 --> 01:27:48,565
Speaker 5:  through. Again, you can just go listen to this episode of Coder. It is totally

1418
01:27:48,925 --> 01:27:51,565
Speaker 5:  fascinating 'cause the lines are so scrambled in ways you would never expect,

1419
01:27:52,025 --> 01:27:54,485
Speaker 5:  but it's big versus small. And so Brendan is

1420
01:27:55,685 --> 01:27:59,165
Speaker 5:  babbling is running his mouth about the two-tiered system of justice and

1421
01:27:59,165 --> 01:28:03,045
Speaker 5:  the Biden administration and how conservatives were punished. And in reality,

1422
01:28:03,785 --> 01:28:07,765
Speaker 5:  you had the owner of M-S-N-B-C Comcast and the owner of Fox

1423
01:28:07,835 --> 01:28:10,965
Speaker 5:  News, Rupert Murdoch totally aligned.

1424
01:28:11,655 --> 01:28:15,165
Speaker 5:  There wasn't any daylight between them and how they wanted Biden to regulate

1425
01:28:15,165 --> 01:28:18,525
Speaker 5:  these systems. You had small companies like

1426
01:28:18,755 --> 01:28:22,445
Speaker 5:  newsmax saying, no, we actually need access. We actually need the regulator

1427
01:28:22,445 --> 01:28:26,435
Speaker 5:  to step up and open the door. And just

1428
01:28:26,535 --> 01:28:30,195
Speaker 5:  on its face you can see that Brendan is lying. He's concocting a

1429
01:28:30,195 --> 01:28:33,715
Speaker 5:  justification for his own bad behavior out of nothing.

1430
01:28:34,595 --> 01:28:37,975
Speaker 5:  And we are sitting here with the receipts. We've done the reporting for over

1431
01:28:38,095 --> 01:28:41,895
Speaker 5:  a decade on the FCC and how it works. And I can tell you that It is almost

1432
01:28:41,895 --> 01:28:45,575
Speaker 5:  always big versus small. It is very, very rarely

1433
01:28:45,975 --> 01:28:49,895
Speaker 5:  Republican versus Democrat. And I just think that Brendan is making this

1434
01:28:50,815 --> 01:28:54,735
Speaker 5:  a political project when it should be an access project, when it should

1435
01:28:54,735 --> 01:28:57,415
Speaker 5:  be about everybody having access to the internet on a fair level playing

1436
01:28:57,415 --> 01:29:01,325
Speaker 5:  field. When it should be about ISPs not being able to throttle you. It

1437
01:29:01,325 --> 01:29:04,645
Speaker 5:  should be about cable systems being cheaper. It should be about prices going

1438
01:29:04,645 --> 01:29:08,085
Speaker 5:  down over time. It should be about Americans paying lower prices for faster

1439
01:29:08,225 --> 01:29:11,565
Speaker 5:  speeds. We pay the highest prices in the world for some of the slowest speeds

1440
01:29:11,565 --> 01:29:15,405
Speaker 5:  available. And instead he's making about dumb political

1441
01:29:15,565 --> 01:29:19,365
Speaker 5:  bullshit because it lets him use power over and over and over again. He

1442
01:29:19,365 --> 01:29:23,085
Speaker 5:  wants to find justifications for him to assert authority over things He should

1443
01:29:23,095 --> 01:29:27,005
Speaker 5:  never have any authority over whatsoever. So every week I say this,

1444
01:29:27,005 --> 01:29:30,245
Speaker 5:  Brendan, I know you listen, I'm dead shore of it now

1445
01:29:30,925 --> 01:29:34,775
Speaker 5:  I know you get Google results for your own name, my man. Come on the show,

1446
01:29:35,525 --> 01:29:39,345
Speaker 5:  come talk to us about this. The people want you to come on decoder, come

1447
01:29:39,345 --> 01:29:43,275
Speaker 5:  on The Vergecast, see if you can make sense of this. See if you can justify

1448
01:29:43,275 --> 01:29:47,155
Speaker 5:  your own power seeking behavior because it's just every week it's getting

1449
01:29:47,155 --> 01:29:50,395
Speaker 5:  stupider and stupider. We can all see it. That's been Brendan Carr's dummy

1450
01:29:50,665 --> 01:29:52,195
Speaker 5:  America's favorite podcast within podcast.

1451
01:29:54,565 --> 01:29:57,135
Speaker 6:  That was good. That's good. I'm glad you wrote that out that that really

1452
01:29:57,555 --> 01:29:58,615
Speaker 5:  Can you tell that I it

1453
01:29:58,615 --> 01:30:00,215
Speaker 6:  Helped the, the writing helped, I think. Yeah.

1454
01:30:01,355 --> 01:30:02,535
Speaker 5:  All right. We need a pallet cleanser.

1455
01:30:02,535 --> 01:30:05,415
Speaker 6:  Wait, I have a TV I wanna talk to you about. Okay. You may remember

1456
01:30:06,325 --> 01:30:09,855
Speaker 6:  from, was it last year that you, you came on the show and told us the story

1457
01:30:09,855 --> 01:30:13,595
Speaker 6:  about being at the the TV shootout? Yes. That was like last

1458
01:30:13,595 --> 01:30:13,955
Speaker 6:  summer.

1459
01:30:13,955 --> 01:30:16,835
Speaker 5:  The best thing I've ever done in this, in this entire job is going to the

1460
01:30:16,835 --> 01:30:17,475
Speaker 5:  TV shootout.

1461
01:30:18,015 --> 01:30:21,395
Speaker 6:  So, and this is like Richard is the perfect person to have here to do this

1462
01:30:21,395 --> 01:30:25,075
Speaker 6:  with us. There is a new there there,

1463
01:30:25,295 --> 01:30:28,555
Speaker 6:  it has been upgraded. The one that won, there's now a new one,

1464
01:30:28,905 --> 01:30:32,315
Speaker 5:  Sony, they've announced a new one. Okay. And they, and they only announced

1465
01:30:32,315 --> 01:30:36,195
Speaker 5:  it in an event in Japan. So we sent former Verge editor Sam Byford

1466
01:30:36,195 --> 01:30:40,155
Speaker 5:  to the event in Japan. Sony has announced a number of new TVs there. They

1467
01:30:40,155 --> 01:30:43,655
Speaker 5:  don't do their TVs at CS anymore, they just do them

1468
01:30:43,905 --> 01:30:46,415
Speaker 5:  later in the year. 'cause ever they know everyone will pay attention to them.

1469
01:30:46,415 --> 01:30:50,095
Speaker 5:  Anyway, so they did the mini LED a few weeks ago and then they just announced

1470
01:30:50,605 --> 01:30:53,135
Speaker 5:  that Sonia Bravia eight two,

1471
01:30:54,655 --> 01:30:57,145
Speaker 5:  this is the name you gotta love

1472
01:30:57,145 --> 01:30:58,545
Speaker 6:  Sony, not the Bravia nine. You

1473
01:30:58,625 --> 01:31:01,945
Speaker 5:  Absolutely have to love Sony's naming schemes. It's so bad,

1474
01:31:02,515 --> 01:31:05,425
Speaker 5:  right? They have the Bravia nine, but now they have the BRAVIA eight two.

1475
01:31:06,895 --> 01:31:09,745
Speaker 5:  Wait, the, I can't tell you, but also it doesn't how little census makes,

1476
01:31:10,215 --> 01:31:13,625
Speaker 6:  Correct me if I'm wrong, but the doesn't, the BRAVIA eight two

1477
01:31:13,975 --> 01:31:17,225
Speaker 6:  replace not the BRAVIA eight, but the A 95 L.

1478
01:31:17,445 --> 01:31:20,905
Speaker 5:  Yep, that's correct. So the Bravia nine is is a mini LED.

1479
01:31:21,685 --> 01:31:25,225
Speaker 5:  You got it. And the BRAVIA eight two is a

1480
01:31:25,355 --> 01:31:27,545
Speaker 5:  cutie ed that replaces the A 95 L.

1481
01:31:28,125 --> 01:31:31,935
Speaker 6:  When we buy TikTok, I think we should just rename it to a string of

1482
01:31:31,935 --> 01:31:34,095
Speaker 6:  letters and numbers that have nothing to do with anything.

1483
01:31:34,235 --> 01:31:37,135
Speaker 5:  It makes, this makes no sense. By the way, the regular BRAV eight is still

1484
01:31:37,135 --> 01:31:40,895
Speaker 5:  on sale. That's just a regular oled. So you have the BRAVIA eight,

1485
01:31:40,895 --> 01:31:44,615
Speaker 5:  which is an ed, the BRAVIA eight two, which is the new flagship QD

1486
01:31:44,775 --> 01:31:48,535
Speaker 5:  ed. And then the bra nine, which is led, I don't know man,

1487
01:31:48,645 --> 01:31:51,655
Speaker 5:  it's 125%. The peak brightness of the A 95 L

1488
01:31:52,615 --> 01:31:56,135
Speaker 5:  150% of the BRAVIA eight. So it's just basically the same idea

1489
01:31:56,555 --> 01:32:00,125
Speaker 5:  but brighter. And then if you remember from that whole TV shootout conversation,

1490
01:32:00,915 --> 01:32:04,645
Speaker 5:  that is very much not about features, right? Like HDM

1491
01:32:04,645 --> 01:32:08,085
Speaker 5:  ports or whatever. It's just about image reproduction and how closely it

1492
01:32:08,085 --> 01:32:11,165
Speaker 5:  can be calibrated to match a reference display. The reference display is

1493
01:32:11,165 --> 01:32:14,645
Speaker 5:  made by Sony. So everyone thinks this is unfair. Sony makes alt like they

1494
01:32:14,645 --> 01:32:17,925
Speaker 5:  have dominant market share and reference displays in Hollywood. So it makes

1495
01:32:17,925 --> 01:32:21,605
Speaker 5:  sense that they're the winners anyway. Now they're just openly saying this

1496
01:32:21,605 --> 01:32:25,125
Speaker 5:  TV will look most like this reference display. So they're, they've they've,

1497
01:32:25,125 --> 01:32:29,085
Speaker 5:  they've, they've just taken it fully on that they have this advantage. They

1498
01:32:29,085 --> 01:32:33,075
Speaker 5:  say it looks great, Sam said it looks great. We'll see, I'm, they say

1499
01:32:33,075 --> 01:32:36,955
Speaker 5:  it's gonna be cheaper than a 95 L. The A 90 L is very, the 8 9 5 L is

1500
01:32:36,955 --> 01:32:40,915
Speaker 5:  very expensive. It's $5,000 for the 77 inch one. Oh. And that's as

1501
01:32:40,915 --> 01:32:44,595
Speaker 5:  big as it gets. TVs are getting real big now and a nine five L is still 77

1502
01:32:44,595 --> 01:32:48,235
Speaker 5:  inches. So my guess is they're gonna make one bigger one that's more expensive

1503
01:32:48,235 --> 01:32:49,675
Speaker 5:  and the 77 will come down to price.

1504
01:32:50,995 --> 01:32:54,255
Speaker 6:  We, Richard, be honest, you're, you have, you have tickets booked to go to

1505
01:32:54,255 --> 01:32:56,655
Speaker 6:  Japan and buy one of these? Just, just tell me the truth.

1506
01:32:57,945 --> 01:33:01,685
Speaker 7:  No, I'm just going to buy three tickets and have the TV

1507
01:33:01,715 --> 01:33:02,325
Speaker 7:  come to me

1508
01:33:03,335 --> 01:33:06,985
Speaker 6:  Like first class. Okay. Just a full, full row of, of

1509
01:33:07,465 --> 01:33:09,665
Speaker 7:  You about the tar man. I can't be out here wasting money.

1510
01:33:10,605 --> 01:33:11,825
Speaker 6:  That's, that's just being smart.

1511
01:33:11,895 --> 01:33:14,825
Speaker 5:  It's all Can I, can I, can I say the best part of this story, which is not

1512
01:33:14,825 --> 01:33:18,585
Speaker 5:  the BRAVIA eight two, the best part of the story is that Sony is also

1513
01:33:18,865 --> 01:33:22,345
Speaker 5:  introducing a new entry level TV in the United States, which is called

1514
01:33:23,125 --> 01:33:24,665
Speaker 5:  the bravia two two

1515
01:33:26,175 --> 01:33:26,465
Speaker 6:  What?

1516
01:33:26,615 --> 01:33:26,905
Speaker 7:  Sony,

1517
01:33:27,135 --> 01:33:31,105
Speaker 5:  It's BRAVIA two numeral and then Bra two roman

1518
01:33:31,345 --> 01:33:35,145
Speaker 5:  numeral. It's the BRAVIA two two. It's great. I mean it's, it's

1519
01:33:35,145 --> 01:33:35,585
Speaker 5:  spectacular.

1520
01:33:35,885 --> 01:33:39,665
Speaker 7:  The sequel to a TV that was not sold in the us Yeah. So no one will even

1521
01:33:39,855 --> 01:33:41,225
Speaker 7:  what the original BRAVIA two was,

1522
01:33:42,835 --> 01:33:45,245
Speaker 5:  They didn't sell the original BRAVIA two here. So you're gonna go in the

1523
01:33:45,245 --> 01:33:49,075
Speaker 5:  store there, you see the BRAVIA two two, it's very good. There

1524
01:33:49,175 --> 01:33:51,995
Speaker 6:  Are so many better options.

1525
01:33:52,945 --> 01:33:56,275
Speaker 6:  Call it the BRAVIA three call it just the bravia two

1526
01:33:56,865 --> 01:33:59,595
Speaker 6:  parentheses the year that It is. Yep. There's

1527
01:33:59,595 --> 01:34:02,035
Speaker 7:  So have you ever tried to like talk to a person about buying the Sony noise

1528
01:34:02,035 --> 01:34:04,915
Speaker 7:  canceling headphones? Because you sound insane once you start trying to tell

1529
01:34:04,915 --> 01:34:06,715
Speaker 7:  them what the name is. Okay, so they're really good.

1530
01:34:08,625 --> 01:34:08,915
Speaker 7:  Yeah,

1531
01:34:09,335 --> 01:34:10,195
Speaker 5:  The w something

1532
01:34:10,255 --> 01:34:13,235
Speaker 6:  You at the WFH 0 0 0 0 0 H four.

1533
01:34:14,385 --> 01:34:17,875
Speaker 5:  It's very good. Bravia Tutu is a hall of fame

1534
01:34:18,425 --> 01:34:22,325
Speaker 5:  name for any product in history. It is, it's very

1535
01:34:22,325 --> 01:34:22,565
Speaker 5:  good.

1536
01:34:24,105 --> 01:34:27,965
Speaker 6:  The thing about It is no, no one will ever hear that name correctly. The

1537
01:34:27,965 --> 01:34:31,885
Speaker 6:  first time you'll say the Bravia two two and they'll, they'll think you

1538
01:34:31,885 --> 01:34:34,365
Speaker 6:  had to think about it and it's actually called the BRAVIA two, but you were

1539
01:34:34,365 --> 01:34:37,325
Speaker 6:  trying to remember if it's the two or the three. And, and so they'll think

1540
01:34:37,325 --> 01:34:40,165
Speaker 6:  you just said the Bravia two and then they'll buy last generation televisions.

1541
01:34:40,225 --> 01:34:41,845
Speaker 6:  And that is just a shame.

1542
01:34:42,025 --> 01:34:44,725
Speaker 5:  By the way, we've had a number of requests for updates on Saturday Samsung.

1543
01:34:46,745 --> 01:34:48,045
Speaker 6:  We have an all timer this week,

1544
01:34:48,775 --> 01:34:52,525
Speaker 5:  Which you'll recall is Samsung's executives

1545
01:34:52,635 --> 01:34:56,565
Speaker 5:  were required to start coming into the office on Saturdays, six days

1546
01:34:56,605 --> 01:35:00,445
Speaker 5:  a week to increase sales, which means they can only

1547
01:35:00,445 --> 01:35:04,285
Speaker 5:  have wacky ideas, right? That's not a product development cycle that's

1548
01:35:04,285 --> 01:35:08,205
Speaker 5:  just come in on Saturday and think of ways to juice sales. Actually David,

1549
01:35:08,365 --> 01:35:11,765
Speaker 5:  I don't know what you think the a timer is. You, you go first. I've got mine.

1550
01:35:12,105 --> 01:35:12,325
Speaker 5:  Oh,

1551
01:35:12,785 --> 01:35:15,205
Speaker 6:  Do we have different, I mine's, mine's a vacuum cleaner.

1552
01:35:15,715 --> 01:35:18,805
Speaker 5:  Okay. You've got the va I've got, no, I've got a TV one. Mine is,

1553
01:35:19,565 --> 01:35:23,285
Speaker 5:  this is several weeks ago now. They launched a $10,000 bundle

1554
01:35:23,345 --> 01:35:26,445
Speaker 5:  of eight TVs. So that's a Richard Bundle. You

1555
01:35:27,225 --> 01:35:30,605
Speaker 5:  put eight TVs that range from 55 to 98 inches

1556
01:35:31,265 --> 01:35:35,085
Speaker 5:  on the wall and they just, but they just sell it to you as one bundle.

1557
01:35:36,025 --> 01:35:39,885
Speaker 5:  And there are pitches that you will save $6,000 by buying

1558
01:35:39,885 --> 01:35:40,845
Speaker 5:  the TVs in bulk.

1559
01:35:41,145 --> 01:35:44,925
Speaker 6:  So like when I, I, I played ultimate Frisbee in college and we would buy,

1560
01:35:45,665 --> 01:35:49,325
Speaker 6:  you could buy like a bulk bag of just like random misprint

1561
01:35:49,885 --> 01:35:53,125
Speaker 6:  frisbees for way cheaper than you would buy the me. That's what this makes

1562
01:35:53,125 --> 01:35:56,045
Speaker 6:  me think of. You're just like, give us 10 grand, we're gonna ship you a bunch

1563
01:35:56,045 --> 01:35:59,965
Speaker 6:  of televisions. There'll be some sizes, some models where

1564
01:35:59,965 --> 01:36:03,445
Speaker 6:  you're just gonna get like a grab bag of televisions for $10,000. Yeah, I

1565
01:36:03,445 --> 01:36:07,405
Speaker 5:  Love it. So you get 1 98 inch, 1 65 inch,

1566
01:36:08,465 --> 01:36:12,365
Speaker 5:  oh no, you get 4 65 inch, but one is eight

1567
01:36:12,485 --> 01:36:13,525
Speaker 5:  K for some reason.

1568
01:36:15,915 --> 01:36:19,855
Speaker 5:  So you get 1 98 inch 4K, 1 65 inch eight

1569
01:36:19,975 --> 01:36:23,655
Speaker 5:  k, 365 inch 4K, and 3 55 inch four

1570
01:36:23,755 --> 01:36:27,655
Speaker 5:  Ks. None of them are alls, they're all just like medium good Samsung Q

1571
01:36:27,655 --> 01:36:31,615
Speaker 5:  LEDs. The funniest thing about this is when people buy lots of TVs

1572
01:36:31,615 --> 01:36:34,055
Speaker 5:  like this, usually what they do is they plug them into a matrix switcher

1573
01:36:34,275 --> 01:36:38,255
Speaker 5:  so they can put them in a grid and they get one big picture. But Samsung

1574
01:36:38,635 --> 01:36:42,575
Speaker 5:  is not selling you an even number of any size, so you

1575
01:36:42,575 --> 01:36:44,945
Speaker 5:  can't do that. This is just the whoop

1576
01:36:44,945 --> 01:36:47,785
Speaker 7:  Thing. When they, when they just sell a bag and they're like, yeah, it's

1577
01:36:47,785 --> 01:36:49,985
Speaker 7:  five bucks, you'll get So we'll, we'll send you some tv.

1578
01:36:50,595 --> 01:36:50,945
Speaker 5:  Don't

1579
01:36:50,945 --> 01:36:53,745
Speaker 6:  Worry about it. Yeah. Like those people who buy like pallets of return stuff

1580
01:36:53,745 --> 01:36:56,305
Speaker 6:  from Amazon and it's like you just kind of get what you get. This is

1581
01:36:56,305 --> 01:36:59,385
Speaker 5:  Like actually really good. This is the most, this is I think the most Saturday

1582
01:36:59,385 --> 01:37:03,145
Speaker 5:  Samsung we've had yet out of all of the thing. Like remember the previous

1583
01:37:03,145 --> 01:37:06,625
Speaker 5:  ideas were like, buy a phone, get a tv, buy a tv, get a tv. This is just

1584
01:37:06,985 --> 01:37:10,585
Speaker 5:  like, here's eight TVs for

1585
01:37:10,605 --> 01:37:11,745
Speaker 5:  $10,000.

1586
01:37:12,525 --> 01:37:13,305
Speaker 6:  That's so good.

1587
01:37:14,065 --> 01:37:16,305
Speaker 5:  That's very good. All right. What, what's yours? Yours. Some vacuum cleaner.

1588
01:37:16,535 --> 01:37:20,345
Speaker 6:  Mine is just, just very briefly, I just wanna mention the bespoke AI

1589
01:37:20,365 --> 01:37:24,145
Speaker 6:  Jet Ultra, an $1,100 vacuum cleaner that has

1590
01:37:24,665 --> 01:37:27,905
Speaker 6:  a screen on it that shows you a bunch of stuff, but also shows you

1591
01:37:27,905 --> 01:37:31,705
Speaker 6:  notifications for phone calls and text messages on your vacuum cleaner.

1592
01:37:31,705 --> 01:37:34,745
Speaker 6:  Samsung is now big into the idea that you should be able to do things like

1593
01:37:34,815 --> 01:37:38,785
Speaker 6:  make phone calls from your appliances. And I just, I just

1594
01:37:38,785 --> 01:37:41,465
Speaker 6:  want everyone to know that. I think that's fantastic and I'm extremely in

1595
01:37:41,465 --> 01:37:42,345
Speaker 6:  favor of it. Yeah,

1596
01:37:42,805 --> 01:37:45,825
Speaker 5:  I'm, I'm down. Look, you, once you put the screen everywhere, you gotta,

1597
01:37:45,825 --> 01:37:46,745
Speaker 5:  you gotta have a screen everywhere.

1598
01:37:46,905 --> 01:37:50,305
Speaker 6:  I want like Apple style live updates. So I'm getting like sports scores

1599
01:37:50,965 --> 01:37:54,185
Speaker 6:  as I'm vacuuming. Like this is, let's just go all into this. I'm ready.

1600
01:37:54,245 --> 01:37:57,605
Speaker 5:  My favorite again, when I say unsponsored for flavor, what I want you to

1601
01:37:57,605 --> 01:38:01,045
Speaker 5:  think of is when they're sponsored, they lack flavor. My favorite right now

1602
01:38:01,425 --> 01:38:05,005
Speaker 5:  is a bunch of tech influencers are taking money

1603
01:38:05,585 --> 01:38:09,245
Speaker 5:  to pretend the LG microwave, they announced at CS that doesn't have a window,

1604
01:38:09,265 --> 01:38:12,205
Speaker 5:  but instead has a screen and then there's a camera inside the microwave to

1605
01:38:12,205 --> 01:38:16,005
Speaker 5:  show you what's happening inside the microwave. But you can also watch TV

1606
01:38:16,025 --> 01:38:19,525
Speaker 5:  on the screen. A lot of people are pretending this is a gonna,

1607
01:38:20,185 --> 01:38:22,565
Speaker 6:  My absolute favorite thing about that is everybody has the same picture,

1608
01:38:22,565 --> 01:38:25,525
Speaker 6:  right? Which is them standing sort of across their kitchen from it and it's

1609
01:38:25,525 --> 01:38:28,645
Speaker 6:  behind them and it looks like the fakest most like

1610
01:38:28,845 --> 01:38:32,685
Speaker 6:  photoshopped bullshit screen back there. It's so

1611
01:38:32,925 --> 01:38:35,485
Speaker 6:  terrible. It's really good. You're like, look at my beautifully modern kitchen

1612
01:38:35,505 --> 01:38:36,725
Speaker 6:  and this horrible Android

1613
01:38:37,125 --> 01:38:40,725
Speaker 5:  Happened. It's like, you can watch TV on this micro. It's like

1614
01:38:40,905 --> 01:38:44,485
Speaker 5:  no lack of flavor is what I'm calling out there. My friends.

1615
01:38:45,275 --> 01:38:49,205
Speaker 5:  Just a few more here in the lightning round. Unsurprising, I think

1616
01:38:49,625 --> 01:38:53,205
Speaker 5:  for this audience, Tesla sales plummeted 13% this quarter,

1617
01:38:53,205 --> 01:38:56,965
Speaker 5:  particularly European countries. There's some juicing of numbers in other

1618
01:38:56,965 --> 01:38:59,925
Speaker 5:  regions. We'll see. But it, it just seems like,

1619
01:39:00,995 --> 01:39:04,175
Speaker 5:  man, if you, there's not a better financial decision than buying a used model

1620
01:39:04,175 --> 01:39:08,135
Speaker 5:  three right now. There's a lot of reasons not to do that, but boy can you

1621
01:39:08,135 --> 01:39:11,415
Speaker 5:  get one for no money 'cause they are being traded in at such insane rates,

1622
01:39:11,545 --> 01:39:14,135
Speaker 5:  which I think is gonna depress the new sales as well. Richard,

1623
01:39:14,275 --> 01:39:17,615
Speaker 6:  Do you see, do you see a lot of Teslas around? I I've been trying to like

1624
01:39:17,625 --> 01:39:21,375
Speaker 6:  chart the number of Teslas I see in my day to day and I'm convinced in my

1625
01:39:21,375 --> 01:39:24,295
Speaker 6:  neighborhood it has gone down. I can't prove it, but I'm convinced.

1626
01:39:24,735 --> 01:39:24,975
Speaker 5:  It's

1627
01:39:24,975 --> 01:39:28,775
Speaker 7:  Hard to say. I still, I still see quite a bit, but like I live where GM

1628
01:39:28,935 --> 01:39:32,535
Speaker 7:  engineers go to retire, so I see a lot of like Hummers, like electric Hummers.

1629
01:39:32,535 --> 01:39:32,735
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

1630
01:39:32,875 --> 01:39:33,335
Speaker 5:  All the time.

1631
01:39:34,585 --> 01:39:34,875
Speaker 6:  Sick.

1632
01:39:35,375 --> 01:39:39,315
Speaker 5:  My sense is that GM is rushing out a bunch of its TVs. So Tesla

1633
01:39:39,365 --> 01:39:43,115
Speaker 5:  sales in Europe were down 43%. I'm saying about the numbers were a little

1634
01:39:43,115 --> 01:39:46,755
Speaker 5:  weird in China, they were down until the final week of the quarter when insurance

1635
01:39:46,915 --> 01:39:50,235
Speaker 5:  registrations like went, just went up. So like nobody knows why that happened.

1636
01:39:50,975 --> 01:39:54,315
Speaker 5:  So sales are kind of dropping. And then here in the United States, GM

1637
01:39:55,035 --> 01:39:58,515
Speaker 5:  reported 32,000 EVs are sold in the first quarter, which is double, it's

1638
01:39:58,515 --> 01:40:01,915
Speaker 5:  year over year. So the demand is still there, it's just going into other

1639
01:40:01,915 --> 01:40:05,715
Speaker 5:  places. Lucid is claiming that it's selling a bunch of EVs. So I think

1640
01:40:05,835 --> 01:40:09,555
Speaker 5:  the demand is, is is moving. And I think General Motors in particular is

1641
01:40:09,555 --> 01:40:12,635
Speaker 5:  trying to get some of its newest ones just like out the door,

1642
01:40:13,435 --> 01:40:17,335
Speaker 5:  like the Cadillac Vista, that's the new three row

1643
01:40:17,575 --> 01:40:21,415
Speaker 5:  SUV. Like it's not announced like they announced in November, but they haven't

1644
01:40:21,415 --> 01:40:24,135
Speaker 5:  like had a launch for it. And they're already dealers who are like, we have

1645
01:40:24,255 --> 01:40:28,215
Speaker 5:  'em now. And you just get the sense that like between tariffs and being aggressive

1646
01:40:28,215 --> 01:40:31,535
Speaker 5:  about Tesla, they're just trying to get products into showroom so people

1647
01:40:31,535 --> 01:40:33,295
Speaker 5:  can buy them. We'll see everybody

1648
01:40:33,295 --> 01:40:36,335
Speaker 6:  Who has been waiting for there to be a moment to take down Tesla

1649
01:40:37,185 --> 01:40:40,095
Speaker 6:  seems to be sensing that It is right now. Which is very funny because there

1650
01:40:40,095 --> 01:40:43,735
Speaker 6:  are a lot of pretty ugly wins against the car

1651
01:40:43,975 --> 01:40:47,695
Speaker 6:  industry as a whole and against EVs in, in specific and,

1652
01:40:47,795 --> 01:40:50,895
Speaker 6:  and yet there is like, to your point about the model three being a great

1653
01:40:50,895 --> 01:40:54,365
Speaker 6:  financial decision, like it's, It is super telling that that is the case

1654
01:40:54,865 --> 01:40:58,645
Speaker 6:  and still these numbers are what they are. Right? Like it's people

1655
01:40:58,705 --> 01:41:02,165
Speaker 6:  are not buying these cars for Elon Musk reasons.

1656
01:41:02,625 --> 01:41:05,205
Speaker 5:  That's super. That No, I'm saying a new model three is not a great to, although

1657
01:41:05,205 --> 01:41:08,525
Speaker 5:  those prices are coming down and they're doing 0% financing and like Elon

1658
01:41:08,525 --> 01:41:10,605
Speaker 5:  will come to your house and like kiss your baby if you buy one right now.

1659
01:41:10,675 --> 01:41:14,485
Speaker 5:  Like they're desperate to move those cars. Yeah. A used model three

1660
01:41:15,045 --> 01:41:18,805
Speaker 5:  a year old has depreciated so much that like if you're in the market

1661
01:41:18,825 --> 01:41:22,685
Speaker 5:  for a car, a two or 3-year-old model three is like

1662
01:41:22,835 --> 01:41:26,765
Speaker 5:  financially the only logical decision anyone should make. Lots of people

1663
01:41:26,765 --> 01:41:29,205
Speaker 5:  are not gonna make that decision and that number is gonna keep coming down.

1664
01:41:29,235 --> 01:41:32,845
Speaker 6:  Yeah. What does it cost to take off the Tesla logo and put on like an Audi

1665
01:41:32,875 --> 01:41:33,965
Speaker 6:  logo? You add that

1666
01:41:33,965 --> 01:41:35,765
Speaker 5:  Into, have you seen the cyber truck that's floating in New York City with

1667
01:41:35,765 --> 01:41:39,405
Speaker 5:  a Toyota logo on the back? It's very good. It's very good.

1668
01:41:39,695 --> 01:41:43,165
Speaker 5:  David, you have been paying attention to Alexa Plus, which is launched in

1669
01:41:43,165 --> 01:41:46,205
Speaker 5:  early access, but none of us believe it's actually out. Yeah. Like

1670
01:41:46,645 --> 01:41:50,485
Speaker 6:  Launched in the most aggressive air quotes you can possibly

1671
01:41:50,515 --> 01:41:53,685
Speaker 6:  imagine. I have not heard from one

1672
01:41:54,275 --> 01:41:57,485
Speaker 6:  regular human who has it. Like we, we've been looking around on social.

1673
01:41:58,525 --> 01:42:00,925
Speaker 6:  I know other reporters who have been looking. Joanna Stern has like been

1674
01:42:00,925 --> 01:42:04,725
Speaker 6:  very publicly begging people to be like, tell me you have Alexa Plus. And

1675
01:42:04,725 --> 01:42:07,765
Speaker 6:  it just doesn't seem to be out there. And it's like this is always early

1676
01:42:07,765 --> 01:42:11,285
Speaker 6:  access and it wouldn't be super shocking if you're Amazon to roll this out

1677
01:42:11,285 --> 01:42:15,085
Speaker 6:  to 10 people first. So I'm not necessarily taking this as like a

1678
01:42:15,235 --> 01:42:17,805
Speaker 6:  totally disastrous thing. Well,

1679
01:42:17,825 --> 01:42:18,165
Speaker 5:  The fact

1680
01:42:18,165 --> 01:42:20,485
Speaker 7:  That they said it was coming at the end of March and then they suddenly said

1681
01:42:20,485 --> 01:42:23,885
Speaker 7:  that it launched on March 31st. Might, might be a

1682
01:42:23,885 --> 01:42:24,485
Speaker 5:  Signal. They

1683
01:42:24,485 --> 01:42:27,885
Speaker 6:  Turned it on for like one random Amazon employee and they were like, we did

1684
01:42:27,885 --> 01:42:28,485
Speaker 6:  it. We launched

1685
01:42:29,835 --> 01:42:30,125
Speaker 5:  Like

1686
01:42:30,185 --> 01:42:31,325
Speaker 6:  You as long as you can, you know,

1687
01:42:31,325 --> 01:42:32,805
Speaker 5:  It's pan outs himself. Cut the

1688
01:42:32,805 --> 01:42:34,325
Speaker 6:  Ribbon with the big scissors. You've, I've

1689
01:42:34,325 --> 01:42:35,565
Speaker 7:  Done my homework at the last minute before

1690
01:42:37,555 --> 01:42:41,245
Speaker 5:  With chat GBT, it's just chat GBT being like you should do

1691
01:42:41,245 --> 01:42:41,685
Speaker 5:  tariffs.

1692
01:42:42,905 --> 01:42:46,605
Speaker 6:  But I do think there are a bunch of features that are missing,

1693
01:42:47,515 --> 01:42:51,245
Speaker 6:  like being able to do some of the more sophisticated AI

1694
01:42:51,245 --> 01:42:55,205
Speaker 6:  stuff. Like have the system sort of infer what you wanna order

1695
01:42:55,225 --> 01:42:59,165
Speaker 6:  and then order food from you or like remind

1696
01:42:59,165 --> 01:43:02,365
Speaker 6:  people around your house to do stuff. A lot of these sort like little tiny

1697
01:43:02,395 --> 01:43:06,005
Speaker 6:  edge cases, but they're the things that were supposed to be

1698
01:43:06,515 --> 01:43:09,525
Speaker 6:  sort of different and useful about Alexa, where it can kind of understand

1699
01:43:09,915 --> 01:43:13,325
Speaker 6:  what you're doing and where you are and what matters to you and then take

1700
01:43:13,325 --> 01:43:17,125
Speaker 6:  action on your behalf. Like that is the pitch for Alexa Plus. And

1701
01:43:17,225 --> 01:43:21,125
Speaker 6:  at least some of that still has not shipped. And, and yet again,

1702
01:43:21,125 --> 01:43:24,805
Speaker 6:  I think it was this week the Washington Post had a report

1703
01:43:25,625 --> 01:43:29,165
Speaker 6:  yet again that there is like a list of things that is way behind and not

1704
01:43:29,165 --> 01:43:32,805
Speaker 6:  ready for public consumption. And it's like, boy, at some point Amazon really

1705
01:43:32,805 --> 01:43:36,685
Speaker 6:  needs to like aggressively flip a this is good switch or

1706
01:43:36,685 --> 01:43:38,525
Speaker 6:  else this is just gonna get ugly. Yeah.

1707
01:43:38,825 --> 01:43:42,445
Speaker 5:  And no one is yet has of yet solved the DoorDash problem. Why would DoorDash

1708
01:43:42,465 --> 01:43:46,365
Speaker 5:  let robots use its service instead of people? No one knows

1709
01:43:46,365 --> 01:43:47,045
Speaker 5:  the answer to this question.

1710
01:43:47,335 --> 01:43:47,685
Speaker 6:  Money.

1711
01:43:47,995 --> 01:43:51,680
Speaker 5:  It's a, but then, then Amazon just has to pay a bunch of, of extra money

1712
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:55,365
Speaker 5:  for every DoorDash order. Yeah. To get whitelist on door

1713
01:43:55,365 --> 01:43:58,565
Speaker 5:  Dash's website. So we can click around on it. This makes no sense to me.

1714
01:43:59,025 --> 01:44:02,925
Speaker 5:  No. All right, last one. I don't understand one word of the story, Richard.

1715
01:44:03,065 --> 01:44:06,525
Speaker 5:  I'm hoping you can explain it to me. Coyote versus Acme is finally coming

1716
01:44:06,525 --> 01:44:07,125
Speaker 5:  to theaters.

1717
01:44:07,435 --> 01:44:11,205
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So a lot of people were online were upset because

1718
01:44:12,165 --> 01:44:15,755
Speaker 7:  Warner Brothers killed a movie that no one had seen. There. There was this,

1719
01:44:15,825 --> 01:44:19,715
Speaker 7:  this coyote, the coyote movie that was supposed to come, it was

1720
01:44:19,715 --> 01:44:23,595
Speaker 7:  like a comedy with people were expecting it. David Oslo decided that it

1721
01:44:23,595 --> 01:44:27,085
Speaker 7:  shouldn't happen and that it would better to just take a tax write off than

1722
01:44:27,085 --> 01:44:27,845
Speaker 7:  to release this movie.

1723
01:44:28,635 --> 01:44:32,125
Speaker 5:  This a classic Zav move by the way. Yeah. Like earlier I was like, where

1724
01:44:32,125 --> 01:44:35,285
Speaker 5:  are the media companies trying to buy TikTok? And his is like, I'm gonna

1725
01:44:35,285 --> 01:44:37,405
Speaker 5:  kill movies I've already paid for. Yeah. Ticket tax.

1726
01:44:38,065 --> 01:44:41,005
Speaker 7:  And there were a bunch of movies that kind of, this happened to, at one time

1727
01:44:41,005 --> 01:44:43,445
Speaker 7:  this was one that people got particularly upset about. So it's been sitting

1728
01:44:43,445 --> 01:44:47,405
Speaker 7:  on the shelf for a few years, but now at long last they have

1729
01:44:47,405 --> 01:44:49,245
Speaker 7:  sold it to Ketchup Entertainment.

1730
01:44:50,105 --> 01:44:50,395
Speaker 5:  Sure.

1731
01:44:50,855 --> 01:44:54,155
Speaker 7:  Who is going to give this movie a theatrical run? And if you would like to

1732
01:44:54,155 --> 01:44:57,475
Speaker 7:  see Coyote versus Ami in theaters, you will have the opportunity to buy a

1733
01:44:57,475 --> 01:45:00,675
Speaker 7:  ticket and do that. And I, I would be watching very closely. I wanna see

1734
01:45:01,015 --> 01:45:03,395
Speaker 7:  how many people really wanna see this movie. It's gonna

1735
01:45:03,395 --> 01:45:06,675
Speaker 6:  Be so funny if this movie sucks. Like,

1736
01:45:07,465 --> 01:45:11,235
Speaker 6:  like the the best outcome for this as, as a reporter is that this movie

1737
01:45:11,235 --> 01:45:14,995
Speaker 6:  turns out to be like great and a phenomenon. And like, I, I really hope that's

1738
01:45:14,995 --> 01:45:18,515
Speaker 6:  what It is. If this movie sucks, like a lot of people are gonna feel really

1739
01:45:18,515 --> 01:45:19,675
Speaker 6:  stupid, including me.

1740
01:45:21,555 --> 01:45:24,995
Speaker 5:  I don't know a ketchup entertainment is, except I do know they spend

1741
01:45:24,995 --> 01:45:28,235
Speaker 5:  $50 million on this movie and they're gonna release it next year. And for

1742
01:45:28,235 --> 01:45:31,235
Speaker 5:  some reason Warner Brothers turned down Amazon, Netflix in Paramount.

1743
01:45:32,055 --> 01:45:36,035
Speaker 6:  That's the part of it I find weird and potentially

1744
01:45:36,055 --> 01:45:39,355
Speaker 6:  for more money. Like it's, it's, it's just a very odd

1745
01:45:41,965 --> 01:45:45,565
Speaker 6:  situation that that Warner's has found itself in that like at some point

1746
01:45:45,845 --> 01:45:47,725
Speaker 6:  somebody had just turned around and was like, wait, you're telling me we

1747
01:45:47,725 --> 01:45:51,645
Speaker 6:  can get a check for this? Get the check. Yeah. And after

1748
01:45:51,865 --> 01:45:52,165
Speaker 6:  all this

1749
01:45:52,315 --> 01:45:54,805
Speaker 7:  Time check, but they don't want it to come out anywhere that anyone knows

1750
01:45:54,805 --> 01:45:55,405
Speaker 7:  about it. Right.

1751
01:45:55,405 --> 01:45:56,445
Speaker 5:  Guess they don't wanna be proven

1752
01:45:56,445 --> 01:45:57,925
Speaker 6:  Wrong. That's interesting, right?

1753
01:45:58,085 --> 01:46:01,605
Speaker 5:  A lot of American businesses is sort of explained by people being like, wait,

1754
01:46:01,605 --> 01:46:05,245
Speaker 5:  money is better than not money. Right? And then like, sort of chaotically

1755
01:46:05,245 --> 01:46:08,725
Speaker 5:  making a decision. This is what I've learned from five years of doing together.

1756
01:46:09,195 --> 01:46:12,565
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I mean there might also be a certain set of, I was just looking and

1757
01:46:12,905 --> 01:46:16,125
Speaker 6:  the, the number they wanted originally was 75 to $80 million

1758
01:46:17,065 --> 01:46:20,805
Speaker 6:  and they are coming, well short of that. But so what might have happened

1759
01:46:20,825 --> 01:46:23,845
Speaker 6:  is they were like, well eventually somebody will give us the money. And then

1760
01:46:24,305 --> 01:46:27,885
Speaker 6:  Zav is like, did we ever get that money? They're like,

1761
01:46:28,345 --> 01:46:30,085
Speaker 6:  no, lemme go get some money.

1762
01:46:30,915 --> 01:46:34,445
Speaker 5:  It's very good. It's a good vergecast mystery. Why is this happening?

1763
01:46:35,175 --> 01:46:37,845
Speaker 5:  Which honestly should be the tagline of our show. Why is this happening?

1764
01:46:37,845 --> 01:46:38,405
Speaker 5:  The Vergecast

1765
01:46:38,635 --> 01:46:41,845
Speaker 6:  Also, if you've seen this movie, I know there are people in the world who

1766
01:46:41,845 --> 01:46:45,325
Speaker 6:  have seen Coyote versus Acme. If you've seen it and if you know if it's any

1767
01:46:45,325 --> 01:46:49,045
Speaker 6:  good, I I need to know. It's so important to me to know whether

1768
01:46:49,165 --> 01:46:50,125
Speaker 6:  this movie is any good.

1769
01:46:50,265 --> 01:46:53,525
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna wrap us up by saying I wrote my annual just buy a Brother Printer

1770
01:46:53,555 --> 01:46:56,885
Speaker 5:  post. It is a third year in a row. I've written the same post. I've stopped

1771
01:46:56,885 --> 01:47:00,205
Speaker 5:  even recommending model numbers. It doesn't even matter. Just buy one for

1772
01:47:00,205 --> 01:47:02,365
Speaker 5:  a hundred bucks and then you'll have it for a decade and it'll be fine. I

1773
01:47:02,365 --> 01:47:06,045
Speaker 5:  only write them every year. 'cause winning searches impossible. And now it's

1774
01:47:06,045 --> 01:47:09,425
Speaker 5:  getting harder because of 'cause of ai. And

1775
01:47:09,845 --> 01:47:13,705
Speaker 5:  I'm also the only person who's ever published AI generated content

1776
01:47:13,725 --> 01:47:16,665
Speaker 5:  on The Verge of an article and the internet just won't be outraged about

1777
01:47:16,665 --> 01:47:20,065
Speaker 5:  it. So if you could just do me a favor and share the printer

1778
01:47:20,065 --> 01:47:23,825
Speaker 5:  recommendation post just in pure outrage, just hack the

1779
01:47:23,835 --> 01:47:27,745
Speaker 5:  algorithms with how mad you are that the verges of been corrupted

1780
01:47:27,745 --> 01:47:30,745
Speaker 5:  by any generated con That would do, it would just do us a favor. We'll make,

1781
01:47:30,755 --> 01:47:33,145
Speaker 5:  maybe I don't, I don't actually know how the Commerce deals work because

1782
01:47:33,145 --> 01:47:36,425
Speaker 5:  we're in sponsor for favor, but some, someone will get some pennies at V

1783
01:47:36,425 --> 01:47:40,165
Speaker 5:  Media when people buy printers and then, you know, we can all buy 10

1784
01:47:40,345 --> 01:47:41,405
Speaker 5:  TVs for $10,000.

1785
01:47:42,125 --> 01:47:45,805
Speaker 6:  I just really like, so I'm looking at, at the first page of Google results

1786
01:47:45,825 --> 01:47:49,605
Speaker 6:  for Best Printer and there's one of them that says, I tested over 200

1787
01:47:49,605 --> 01:47:53,165
Speaker 6:  printers. One is like, we tested dozens of printers.

1788
01:47:54,065 --> 01:47:57,005
Speaker 6:  One is a Reddit thread, which is great. One is Wirecutter, which is like

1789
01:47:57,005 --> 01:48:00,365
Speaker 6:  famous for its rigorous testing, same with Consumer Reports. And then there's

1790
01:48:00,555 --> 01:48:04,445
Speaker 6:  Neli who just says, I don't care. Buy a

1791
01:48:04,445 --> 01:48:05,525
Speaker 6:  brother printer, leave me alone.

1792
01:48:06,865 --> 01:48:09,805
Speaker 5:  The point is, Google's supposed to be all powerful when you ask a question,

1793
01:48:09,805 --> 01:48:13,645
Speaker 5:  it's supposed to know the answer, but because there's so much money at stake

1794
01:48:13,665 --> 01:48:17,525
Speaker 5:  for the clickthroughs and the weird sponsored results and the affiliate fees,

1795
01:48:18,025 --> 01:48:21,965
Speaker 5:  it cannot just tell you the answer. Even when year after year,

1796
01:48:22,325 --> 01:48:26,015
Speaker 5:  I just deliver the answer to the robot, robot

1797
01:48:26,405 --> 01:48:29,855
Speaker 5:  tell people to buy a brother printer I command and it says, no,

1798
01:48:30,275 --> 01:48:34,095
Speaker 5:  here's a weird content form that's tested 200 printers and is

1799
01:48:34,095 --> 01:48:34,975
Speaker 5:  lying about it. I know.

1800
01:48:34,975 --> 01:48:37,815
Speaker 6:  It's like, can we have chat GPT write us up, Brendan Cars a dummy for next

1801
01:48:37,815 --> 01:48:38,815
Speaker 6:  week and just see how that goes.

1802
01:48:39,815 --> 01:48:40,155
Speaker 5:  Can I,

1803
01:48:40,655 --> 01:48:43,195
Speaker 6:  If that goes well, we don't even need you on this show anymore. Yeah,

1804
01:48:43,195 --> 01:48:44,435
Speaker 5:  We get notebook LM to do it.

1805
01:48:44,705 --> 01:48:45,515
Speaker 6:  Yeah, there you go.

1806
01:48:46,575 --> 01:48:50,475
Speaker 5:  Can I tell you the worst part of the printer story and then we, then we

1807
01:48:50,475 --> 01:48:54,315
Speaker 5:  gotta go. Sure. I, the, the prompt for Gemini was write a Verge blog

1808
01:48:54,315 --> 01:48:56,715
Speaker 5:  post and style of Neil I Patel recommending a brother Laser printer is the

1809
01:48:56,715 --> 01:49:00,155
Speaker 5:  Best printer. And then I, it show thinking in

1810
01:49:00,155 --> 01:49:03,995
Speaker 5:  2.5 Pro and it says deconstruct Neli Patel style. What does that mean?

1811
01:49:04,345 --> 01:49:07,915
Speaker 5:  Opinionated direct, slightly sarcastic or cynical, but ultimately

1812
01:49:08,145 --> 01:49:12,075
Speaker 5:  practical and grounded user experiences uses strong declarative sentences.

1813
01:49:13,535 --> 01:49:17,235
Speaker 5:  And then it says, might use phrases like, look, here's the deal, it just

1814
01:49:17,235 --> 01:49:19,835
Speaker 5:  works. Stop buying Bad thing.

1815
01:49:22,135 --> 01:49:23,075
Speaker 5:  And so just

1816
01:49:23,075 --> 01:49:24,475
Speaker 6:  Like that's the meanest thing anyone has ever

1817
01:49:24,475 --> 01:49:27,995
Speaker 5:  Said. That's true. I do say stop buying bad thing all the time. And they

1818
01:49:27,995 --> 01:49:29,075
Speaker 5:  said AI couldn't make art.

1819
01:49:30,825 --> 01:49:31,115
Speaker 6:  They

1820
01:49:31,115 --> 01:49:34,835
Speaker 5:  Said, all right, we gotta go. That's an existential crisis. That's it. That's

1821
01:49:34,835 --> 01:49:35,955
Speaker 5:  of our Chas Rock and roll.

1822
01:49:41,495 --> 01:49:44,675
Speaker 3:  And that's it for The Vergecast this week. And hey, we'd love to hear from
