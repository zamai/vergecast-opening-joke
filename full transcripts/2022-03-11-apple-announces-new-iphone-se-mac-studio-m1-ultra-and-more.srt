26
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,230

27
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,650
Speaker 1:  is not here and I went to a bunch of apple like briefings and they were like,

28
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,710
Speaker 1:  where's Dieter. And I was like, you know where he is? She said your

29
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,640
Speaker 1:  rival, like Dieter wants to work for Google. So at some point we're

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,100
Speaker 1:  going to, I don't know if we should disclose it, but there it is. That's

31
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,070
Speaker 1:  the news. We talked about it a bunch last week. If you missed it, we had

32
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,850
Speaker 1:  a goodbye episode with Walt Mossberg and Dieter was very touching and poignant,

33
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,850
Speaker 1:  and now the world moves on you

34
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,780
Speaker 1:  ready? Enthusiasm. Okay. We've got to start. There's an apple event

35
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,290
Speaker 1:  this week. Tons of apple news. Talk about new chip new phone, new

36
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,040
Speaker 1:  display, new Mac, old USBA ports. Very

37
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,850
Speaker 1:  exciting. I will say that in addition to that, our team is doing just

38
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,780
Speaker 1:  excellent coverage on the tech aspects of the

39
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,410
Speaker 1:  war in Ukraine. That is obviously happening. It's the biggest news in the

40
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,920
Speaker 1:  world. Aside from COVID lots of internet companies, content

41
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,100
Speaker 1:  filtering, major backbone providers are shutting off service in

42
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,880
Speaker 1:  Russia. McKenna had a great scoop about a tech executive that is

43
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,480
Speaker 1:  privately funding, a mercenary army of private soldiers in the

44
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,470
Speaker 1:  country. You know, we talk about policy a lot in the show, the we're

45
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,250
Speaker 1:  just going to block a bunch of Russian channels from American

46
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,090
Speaker 1:  social media companies. Amazon's gonna stop shipping packages

47
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,020
Speaker 1:  and Russia and prime video, that stuff, all the themes

48
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,270
Speaker 1:  that we talked about in the policy side are all just coming to a head there.

49
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,750
Speaker 1:  So we're covering it very deeply. It's the flip side, right? Of

50
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,380
Speaker 1:  like, how should we regulate tech? The tech companies here are sort of pulling

51
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,340
Speaker 1:  out of Russia and then Russia is running its own tech based

52
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,620
Speaker 1:  misinformation campaigns shutting down speech across the country. It's all

53
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,160
Speaker 1:  on the site. I know you don't come to us for Ukraine news on this podcast.

54
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,400
Speaker 1:  I just want to point out because our team is working really hard on it. And

55
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,000
Speaker 1:  there's actually really interesting deep coverage of how plant. So that is

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,180
Speaker 1:  that. Okay. Now a hard segue to the apple event. Good

57
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,940
Speaker 2:  Morning. And welcome back to apple park.

58
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,930
Speaker 1:  So big apple event, medium apple event, small Atlona what do you think

59
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,730
Speaker 3:  Need to get with medium? Yeah,

60
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,150
Speaker 1:  Medium. It was the first one. They try to fake everyone out with this like

61
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,140
Speaker 1:  peak performance thing in

62
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,910
Speaker 1:  AR I promise you. And I talked to a lot of

63
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,480
Speaker 1:  people. Everyone is ready to go back to in-person apple events. I think

64
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,810
Speaker 1:  including apple. I don't think they can ever do the glasses about in-person

65
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,080
Speaker 1:  events.

66
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,470
Speaker 4:  Yeah, they can't. You're going to have to bring all of the, the

67
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,410
Speaker 4:  competitors with you to that first in-person apple

68
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,340
Speaker 4:  event. You can have a little purse full of them. Like

69
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,060
Speaker 4:  don't pay attention to my person, my bag of, of AR headset.

70
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,940
Speaker 1:  It's gonna be great. And I brought my little HTC, Vive, like room-scale

71
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,960
Speaker 1:  cameras

72
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,160
Speaker 4:  Come over here. We're going to do this

73
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,820
Speaker 1:  Together. And he cute. He did. He bring a ladder because I need one. So this

74
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,210
Speaker 1:  one is like, they still did it in the format. We were used

75
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:10,540
Speaker 1:  to Tim cook on the stage at the apple, the Steve jobs

76
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,750
Speaker 1:  theater zooming out to other parts of the campus. Very

77
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,470
Speaker 1:  infomercial lightning, fast, very fast, especially the first

78
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,430
Speaker 1:  half. They just race through this thing. The theme of it was

79
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,190
Speaker 1:  like, we make our own chips or chips are great. Look, we put our chips in

80
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,180
Speaker 1:  everything. We did it. Okay. So let's just start with it. They did a new

81
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,810
Speaker 1:  iPhone se they did a new iPad. Then they announced what they are

82
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,680
Speaker 1:  saying is the last of the M one family of chips. Same one

83
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,070
Speaker 1:  ultra. They're putting that in a computer called the max studio, which there's

84
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,740
Speaker 1:  a long history of people wanting a computer, just like this from apple and

85
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,520
Speaker 1:  the United States. Despite let's take them in turn, let's start at the

86
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,240
Speaker 1:  iPhone.

87
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,870
Speaker 2:  And today we're bringing our extraordinary <em></em> bionic

88
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,530
Speaker 2:  chip to another iPhone. The new I

89
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:53,940
Speaker 2:  phone.

90
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,640
Speaker 1:  I see, I think the story of this iPhone is, is 5g shenanigans. But Dan, tell

91
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,160
Speaker 1:  us about the new iPhone se

92
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,000
Speaker 3:  Some 5g shenanigans in that this supports 5g, but it

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,960
Speaker 3:  doesn't support millimeter wave, which we can get into. So it supports what

94
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,680
Speaker 3:  we commonly refer to as sub six 5g or the 5g that you can

95
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,430
Speaker 3:  actually use, which you might actually experience. Otherwise it

96
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,210
Speaker 3:  is the same se that they released in 2020

97
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,720
Speaker 3:  with a new processor and a slightly bigger battery.

98
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,500
Speaker 1:  That's it? Yeah. Same 4.7 inch screen. Same bezel, same

99
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,430
Speaker 1:  touch ID. Yep. Same camera. But the gap, they got the new processor.

100
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,330
Speaker 1:  So the camera should be better.

101
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,830
Speaker 3:  They're saying, they're saying like, you know it, the processor can unlock

102
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,490
Speaker 3:  some things with the camera, but I would not get your hopes up super high

103
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,460
Speaker 3:  for dramatic camera improvements. That it's the same hardware. It's the same

104
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,240
Speaker 3:  single

105
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,990
Speaker 1:  It's got deep fusion dude. It's winter mode. I mean,

106
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,830
Speaker 1:  they're sweater, pictures. Look this phone, sir, grandparents,

107
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,520
Speaker 1:  grandparents get

108
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,570
Speaker 4:  Cold. They

109
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,420
Speaker 1:  Need sweatpants. I called their auto wearing sweaters. It has sweater

110
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,360
Speaker 3:  Mode and it has the single camera portrait mode. But I don't

111
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,720
Speaker 3:  believe it does the night mode. That is like the thing that is

112
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,410
Speaker 3:  like not available on this one, at least to my understanding, it could be

113
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,010
Speaker 3:  wrong. But anyways, so it's a single camera unit. It's got the same front

114
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,640
Speaker 3:  facing camera, which I believe is seven megapixels. It's you know, like you

115
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,600
Speaker 3:  said, the 4.7 inch screen LCD it's got the button. Right? It's got a

116
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,330
Speaker 3:  button. It's got a home button. It's

117
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,290
Speaker 1:  Yeah, no, no nightmare. Yeah. That's okay.

118
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,480
Speaker 1:  I don't, I don't understand that. Like

119
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,240
Speaker 3:  I think that the processor would have be powering that, right? And like it's

120
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,170
Speaker 3:  got the eight, 15 chip, which is the best a series chip that you

121
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,120
Speaker 3:  can get. Right? So that's how they get ya.

122
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,820
Speaker 1:  That's how they get you. That's how they bracket you right up there. Like

123
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,690
Speaker 1:  iPhone, a C customers are never in the dark,

124
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:45,620
Speaker 1:  never happens to carry a flashlight wherever they go. They get

125
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,837
Speaker 1:  so sleeping in bed by 6:00 PM,

126
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,640
Speaker 4:  Curls up in their little sweaters, going to bat.

127
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,280
Speaker 1:  It's a very, it's a cozy phone. It's also

128
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,760
Speaker 3:  The dollars more expensive, which you can almost certainly attribute to the

129
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,750
Speaker 3:  fact that it supports 5g. Hi, I'm on our team has looked at

130
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,740
Speaker 3:  many times into the cost of 5g in phones. I believe there's some

131
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,640
Speaker 3:  reports about the iPhone twelves 5g modem is like its most

132
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,180
Speaker 3:  expensive component. So it's very likely that the price here is

133
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,390
Speaker 3:  related to the fact that it supports 5g. Even though it doesn't support millimeter

134
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,470
Speaker 3:  wave

135
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,370
Speaker 4:  Support, the mid one that like the FCC got up or the FAA

136
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,360
Speaker 4:  got upset about.

137
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,260
Speaker 3:  Yes, yes. It's, that's the C band, which at

138
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,250
Speaker 3:  and T and Verizon are very excited about because it's their only

139
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,120
Speaker 3:  real 5g that you can get and they are rolling it

140
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,930
Speaker 3:  out. And this is fully compatible with it. As far as I understand, it's also

141
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,360
Speaker 3:  compatible with all of T-Mobile's 5g. Sure.

142
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,240
Speaker 4:  Is the millimeter wave thing. Is that a great loss? I feel like it's not

143
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,300
Speaker 4:  a great loss because everybody talks about how terrible it is.

144
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,110
Speaker 1:  It was a lie. And now we can all admit that it's a lie. And

145
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,360
Speaker 1:  before I talk about that, I'm just gonna point out that you can get it in

146
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,450
Speaker 1:  green and you can get the pro in a nice screen. Great. That's all the news

147
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,680
Speaker 1:  where the iPhone,

148
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,610
Speaker 3:  I can get the 13 in green and you can get the pro at Alpine green, but

149
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:05,000
Speaker 3:  the se is it midnight Starlight and product

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,880
Speaker 3:  red?

151
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,680
Speaker 1:  That's it like? Okay, sorry. If you

152
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,110
Speaker 1:  want to curl up by fire and go to bed early

153
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,860
Speaker 1:  with millimeter wave was a

154
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,040
Speaker 1:  lie. Let's just come back to this. I feel very strongly about this. I'm the

155
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,620
Speaker 1:  only person in America who feels very strongly about this, but I'm going

156
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,550
Speaker 1:  to transmit my energy to you through this microphone. You're already

157
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,530
Speaker 4:  Transmitting more energy. The millimeter wave

158
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:31,280
Speaker 1:  Dead. Do you remember when the iPhone 12 came out? Yes. Hans Vestberg from

159
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,150
Speaker 1:  Verizon stood on stage with apple and he was like, 5g is finally

160
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,080
Speaker 1:  here. It was great. It was a great moment. He's got a great accent

161
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,950
Speaker 1:  and very handsome man. He is like, I did it all. This other 5g has been lies.

162
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,610
Speaker 1:  But now that Verizon has millimeter wave on this iPhone and

163
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,970
Speaker 1:  then Dieter and I, in our reviews, we had to like go find street

164
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,360
Speaker 1:  corners. Like I literally was like walking the streets of Manhattan being

165
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,330
Speaker 1:  like that looks like millimeter wave and like standing under the thing. I'm

166
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:01,260
Speaker 1:  pretty sure Verizon put one fire out on purpose and we would test it.

167
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,650
Speaker 1:  And then Joanna like did her video at giant stadium and was like, it works

168
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:08,100
Speaker 1:  great here. And it's nowhere else. And that was 5g on

169
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,550
Speaker 1:  Verizon and Verizon was insane about this. And they

170
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,150
Speaker 1:  demanded that every phone on its network have millimeter wave

171
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:19,140
Speaker 1:  because it defined 5g. Ultra wide band

172
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,590
Speaker 1:  is millimeter wave. It's like ultra fast,

173
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,460
Speaker 1:  extremely low range, high power. You need a

174
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,120
Speaker 1:  special antenna. The iPhones had special antennas on them,

175
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,720
Speaker 1:  custom phones, all this stuff because millimeter wave was the

176
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,470
Speaker 1:  5g that Verizon had and at. And T was like, we

177
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,980
Speaker 1:  honestly are all, most of what we have is lies, but we're along for this

178
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,570
Speaker 1:  ride too. Right? We have a

179
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,700
Speaker 4:  Label we're going to put on the top of the phone,

180
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,620
Speaker 3:  We've got five GE. So we're

181
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,070
Speaker 1:  Good. And underneath that was a bunch of crazy stuff.

182
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,430
Speaker 1:  Like my technology called the dynamic spectrum sharing, where they would

183
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,270
Speaker 1:  reuse the LTE spectrum, but give you a 5g logo. And that was five

184
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:01,140
Speaker 1:  G and it was slow. And I would get on the, you know, we would get on review

185
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,830
Speaker 1:  calls with various phone manufacturers, big 5g slows at DSS. And they'd be

186
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,680
Speaker 1:  like, whoa, there are carriers. It was horrible when

187
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,550
Speaker 4:  You use it in the UK, get some real time.

188
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,850
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Meanwhile like I would get tweets from people in like South Korea being

189
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,430
Speaker 1:  like, what are you talking about? Are you complain about 5g? We get six gigs

190
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:21,180
Speaker 1:  down. This is why we're great at league of legends. Like our

191
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,930
Speaker 1:  Internet's better than yours. It's true. By the way, latent latency is a

192
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,710
Speaker 1:  big thing in e-sports. It was like a real fact. Look, if America wants to

193
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,770
Speaker 1:  dominate the international e-sports scene, we have to upgrade our

194
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,820
Speaker 1:  networks.

195
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,120
Speaker 4:  The reason we need an infrastructure bill to improve our internet and it's

196
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,070
Speaker 4:  country legal legends, we're getting crushed guys, how are

197
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,080
Speaker 4:  we, how are we supposed to like beat them at any,

198
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,800
Speaker 1:  What do you do in Biden? Come on, fix it. So then

199
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,920
Speaker 1:  this past few months that, you know, there's a spectrum auction, they bought

200
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,400
Speaker 1:  the sea band, the disaster with the FAA, the FCC

201
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,820
Speaker 1:  happened. They finally slowly started launching their mid band

202
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,600
Speaker 1:  networks, Verizon redefines,

203
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,590
Speaker 1:  5g, ultra wide band. They're like, well, we made this up.

204
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:08,370
Speaker 1:  So now this doesn't mean the millimeter wave. This means

205
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,360
Speaker 1:  both millimeter wave and this mid band spectrum. And they just

206
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,190
Speaker 1:  sort of like announced it sort

207
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,600
Speaker 3:  Of announced it. I don't know how much

208
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,720
Speaker 1:  Announcing they did. Well. They announced it such that Alison was able to

209
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,050
Speaker 1:  write a piece explaining what all the terms meant, but it was like very under

210
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,680
Speaker 1:  the table, like under the table that I had to go on the way back

211
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,610
Speaker 1:  machine and look at Verizon's website and be like, sometime in January, they

212
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,230
Speaker 1:  changed it, right. There was no

213
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,350
Speaker 3:  Press release that said 5g ultra wide band now

214
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,730
Speaker 3:  means

215
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,180
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Which for two years, they've been saying it means millimeter

216
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,870
Speaker 1:  wave. So the eye, and they've been demanding that every phone on their

217
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,770
Speaker 1:  network that supports 5g, I'm making extremely sarcastic air quotes here

218
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,580
Speaker 1:  that has 5g was a millimeter wave and phones were

219
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,980
Speaker 3:  Compromised for that. Like a, the great example is the pixel for a

220
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,970
Speaker 3:  5g. When the unlocked version came out, it did not support millimeter wave.

221
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,750
Speaker 3:  And it was $400 I think. And then Verizon

222
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,710
Speaker 3:  insisted on the millimeter wave in it. And now the price was $500 for that

223
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,080
Speaker 3:  version or the, I think it was the galaxy as

224
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,890
Speaker 3:  20. That base model did not support millimeter

225
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,850
Speaker 3:  wave, but the Verizon version did. And therefore it was more expensive. So

226
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,030
Speaker 3:  yeah, we've been dealing with that for awhile. And now, now the iPhone se

227
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,080
Speaker 3:  doesn't support.

228
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,660
Speaker 1:  So they announced his phone and like, literally Dan was like, I wonder if

229
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,530
Speaker 1:  it will be on Verizon because it is a millimeter analysts are like,

230
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,070
Speaker 1:  huh, I wonder if it'll be on Verizon or if apple will have a second

231
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:33,820
Speaker 1:  secret, more expensive millimeter wave version. Cause I'm like, we like

232
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,690
Speaker 1:  ask and is like, no, we're gonna carry it in. All it is. Is it because it

233
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,380
Speaker 1:  supports ban? They can claim it's 5g ultra wide

234
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,010
Speaker 1:  man. And they can just stop pretending to give a shit about millimeter

235
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:45,530
Speaker 1:  wave.

236
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:49,390
Speaker 4:  There was like a conversation between apple and Verizon about this, where

237
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:53,050
Speaker 4:  apple was like, we're not going to put your stupid thing in here and market

238
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,890
Speaker 4:  this phone because of your stupid technology deal with it. An apple

239
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,400
Speaker 4:  and Verizon was just like, okay, sure. We'll deal with

240
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,870
Speaker 4:  it.

241
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,140
Speaker 3:  I'm sure there was conversations. I just wonder how much the conversations

242
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:09,130
Speaker 3:  were like. Verizon's like, okay, we're closing on the C band where we

243
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,340
Speaker 3:  almost have apple. Can you wait like four months before you announce it so

244
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,000
Speaker 3:  that we can actually roll out this C-band and then the FAA was like, wait

245
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,690
Speaker 3:  a minute. What are you doing? And then that through

246
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,330
Speaker 1:  I guarantee you, this thing would not have launched if CBN hadn't rolled

247
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,930
Speaker 1:  out. Yeah. They would have just held it. Right. I fantasy was doing fine.

248
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,650
Speaker 1:  They have, you know, whatever phones to support the millimeter

249
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:33,460
Speaker 1:  wave deception that they need to have. But if

250
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,060
Speaker 1:  you hadn't rolled that, C-band, I assume the Verizon would have either

251
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,020
Speaker 1:  insisted on a more expensive phone with millimeter wave

252
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,780
Speaker 1:  or the apple. And I just held it and I bet apple would have just held it.

253
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,740
Speaker 1:  They don't care. Right? It's like, I'm just saying, we

254
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,730
Speaker 1:  have spent two years listening to these companies, at least two years,

255
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,300
Speaker 1:  at least listening to Verizon and at and T

256
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,170
Speaker 1:  ramble on about millimeter wave and ramble on about 5g. It's been

257
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:02,350
Speaker 1:  at least 10 years of 5g. Bullshit. In fact,

258
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,860
Speaker 3:  I would say it's been at least four years of millimeter wave lies

259
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,100
Speaker 3:  because Shawn Hollister wrote about this whole situation

260
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,490
Speaker 3:  about that we're talking about now. And in his article, he

261
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,030
Speaker 3:  cited in 2018, he was at Qualcomm's event in

262
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,540
Speaker 3:  Maui. And like 5g was supposed to be like the

263
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,960
Speaker 3:  ultra wide band millimeter wave demo there that didn't work. And it was just

264
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,830
Speaker 3:  all lies. And that was in 2018. So it's been at least four years of

265
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,460
Speaker 3:  this.

266
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,300
Speaker 1:  And I will say, people have told us, we've seen the tweets. We see like

267
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,100
Speaker 1:  some people can get millimeter wave.

268
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,640
Speaker 4:  I could actually get it. They have a, my old

269
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,270
Speaker 4:  house, my old apartment had the Verizon

270
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:44,170
Speaker 4:  transmission thing on top of it. I had to deal with like months of

271
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:48,160
Speaker 4:  construction as they built their little like air con, they got

272
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,010
Speaker 4:  air conditioning. And I didn't, I was still upset about it. Verizon got air

273
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,490
Speaker 4:  conditioning and I didn't, and it's all there and I can look at it even now

274
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,920
Speaker 4:  and get just incredible speeds.

275
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,290
Speaker 1:  Really? Do you, I called your phone out the window and like, yeah, just

276
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,420
Speaker 4:  Hold my phone out and just kinda hope.

277
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,060
Speaker 1:  But yeah, let's do

278
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,540
Speaker 4:  It, but just me, nobody else can get it.

279
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,450
Speaker 1:  Yeah, because you're probably the only one in the millimeter wave. This industry

280
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,230
Speaker 1:  has for four years now, at least four or five, 10

281
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,740
Speaker 1:  years told us 5g will be transformative. Right? If you

282
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,280
Speaker 1:  remember their early hype, like I would go to dinners with the cell

283
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,150
Speaker 1:  carriers. They would tell me that they were going to compete with AWS.

284
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,460
Speaker 4:  5g robots were going to save lives.

285
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,090
Speaker 1:  Yeah. The amount of telemedicine and telesurgery that would happen

286
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,870
Speaker 1:  like, like robot surgery on demand was like

287
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,470
Speaker 1:  gonna definitely happen because of 5g. Like we were shown pictures

288
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:43,310
Speaker 1:  of, of, of just like rural towns in America

289
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,790
Speaker 1:  that had no access to healthcare. And the self-driving robot on 5g was

290
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:50,000
Speaker 1:  gonna show up and just do surgery and everyone and keeps

291
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,990
Speaker 1:  out right. All that stuff has really not happened. They told me that they

292
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,410
Speaker 1:  were gonna, they were going to disintermediate AWS because to control these

293
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,590
Speaker 1:  networks, they needed to put the data centers closer to the

294
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:04,280
Speaker 1:  edge, which would allow for the extremely low latency applications that we

295
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,340
Speaker 1:  have been promised this whole time. None of that stuff has happened, but

296
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,270
Speaker 1:  they have increased the prices of the funds and they have absolutely

297
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,080
Speaker 1:  increased the prices of the plans for no appreciable benefit and is a

298
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,890
Speaker 1:  scandal that I would say no one is talking about, except we constantly

299
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,670
Speaker 1:  talk all the time. And this phone is great and I'm happy. It's a

300
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,670
Speaker 1:  cheap iPhone. And I know people will be excited about it, but this phone

301
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:29,390
Speaker 1:  is just like proof that all of this fake out

302
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:33,200
Speaker 1:  was just a lie and it achieved nothing. There's actually a wall street

303
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,590
Speaker 1:  journal story last week. It's like, it was a

304
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:40,070
Speaker 1:  journal. So they've made these huge investments in these network and they've

305
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:44,000
Speaker 1:  created no new revenue for themselves and created no new applications

306
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,990
Speaker 1:  that anyone is using. Whereas if you think about LTE, the

307
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,650
Speaker 1:  amount of revenue they created, cause everyone rushed to get faster

308
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:55,580
Speaker 1:  phones. Cause they could feel the speed increase over 3g. And then the applications

309
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,330
Speaker 1:  that were delivered on top of it were all like video applications. Like it

310
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,900
Speaker 1:  was fast enough to support streaming video, which is why they all went and

311
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,220
Speaker 1:  tried to put video providers

312
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,000
Speaker 4:  Kind of reminds me of, of like TV's and

313
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,840
Speaker 4:  they're the 4k like when they went from 10 80 P to 4k and now they're doing

314
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,260
Speaker 4:  like four K to eight K and they're like, aren't you excited about eight K

315
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,950
Speaker 4:  and HDR. And everyone's like, no,

316
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:19,820
Speaker 1:  Like,

317
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,690
Speaker 4:  Like, you know, 10 80 to 4k. That was a big

318
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:27,410
Speaker 4:  leap. And yeah, my eyes bled. It was gorgeous. But most people didn't

319
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,250
Speaker 4:  like eight K is not a significant jump, but 5g

320
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,210
Speaker 4:  for most people. And like the mid band speeds is not a significant jump

321
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:39,200
Speaker 4:  to be like, yeah, I need it. I gotta, I gotta go get my new phone.

322
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,980
Speaker 1:  But we've, we've just spent so long, particularly for Isen. So

323
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,550
Speaker 1:  long hearing about millimeter wave and paying higher

324
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:50,490
Speaker 1:  prices. Right? That's the killer to me is they

325
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:53,970
Speaker 1:  found ways to increase the prices of the plans. They found ways to increase

326
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,810
Speaker 1:  the prices of the devices and they provided nothing.

327
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,470
Speaker 1:  And now with this phone, you can see that at the end of the day, it

328
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,530
Speaker 1:  really all that was just, they needed to be able to market that

329
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:08,280
Speaker 1:  stuff. Now they've got a real network, right? They've

330
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,090
Speaker 1:  got the mid band 5g network. Dan we've seen it perform. It seems

331
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,010
Speaker 1:  fine. I mean, it's, you know,

332
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,490
Speaker 3:  If the typical 4g experiences anywhere from like 30

333
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,330
Speaker 3:  megabit down to 125 megabit down, if you're in a

334
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:25,230
Speaker 3:  good mid band 5g area, you might see 500 megabit down or 600 megabit

335
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,360
Speaker 3:  down. That's not unrealistic

336
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,260
Speaker 4:  On your phone that you did 500 megabit down. Just

337
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,160
Speaker 4:  like, nevermind,

338
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,350
Speaker 3:  Download legal legends. There you

339
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,250
Speaker 3:  go. I will tell you, there was

340
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,210
Speaker 3:  one, there was one instance I don't get mid band where I live. I'm

341
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,840
Speaker 3:  stuck on the still the low end garbage 5g that might as well be 4g where

342
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,590
Speaker 3:  I am. But there was one instance last year when I was in New York city

343
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,950
Speaker 3:  for our ten-year anniversary event

344
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:59,760
Speaker 3:  and I could get T-Mobile's mid band and out

345
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,180
Speaker 3:  sitting in my hotel room and I was like downloaded movies to watch on the

346
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,760
Speaker 3:  train ride home. And I was like, this is it.

347
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,350
Speaker 4:  This is a future right now,

348
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,470
Speaker 3:  Three years. This is the first time I've appreciated 5g.

349
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:14,400
Speaker 1:  Yeah. It's the other thing is that most phones, Android phones,

350
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,790
Speaker 1:  you can figure out what you've got because there's Android utilities and

351
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:21,510
Speaker 1:  an iPhone. It's just like, whatever carrier letters are at the top of your

352
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:25,350
Speaker 1:  phone. And it's almost impossible to know if you're getting what you paid

353
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:29,100
Speaker 1:  for. Like my iPhone right now. It just says 5g. And I, I know

354
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:29,880
Speaker 1:  it's

355
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,060
Speaker 3:  Sometimes mine says five G. Sometimes mine says, cause I'm on T-Mobile they'll

356
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,280
Speaker 3:  say 5g, you see not UWC. You

357
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,180
Speaker 3:  see got a glossary on the site. Alison

358
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:39,990
Speaker 3:  wrote that. So

359
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,940
Speaker 1:  What's what is UC? Is it ultra cool? I had

360
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,940
Speaker 3:  No idea, but it's the same as without the USI.

361
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,870
Speaker 3:  So I'm that nerd

362
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:52,740
Speaker 3:  who's like driving his car and sees you see pop up on his car, play and pulls

363
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,070
Speaker 3:  over and is like, I got to run a speed test and see how much faster this

364
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,880
Speaker 3:  is. And then it's the same speed as, without the UC and without the

365
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,550
Speaker 3:  5g. So like, I don't know. It's all lies.

366
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:06,420
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Anyhow, I'm just saying this has been, if

367
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:10,260
Speaker 1:  people in rural areas can actually get 500 down

368
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,820
Speaker 1:  from their phones to wirelessly

369
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,090
Speaker 4:  Pay you a hundred dollars, if they can do that,

370
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,820
Speaker 1:  But that's actually transformative.

371
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,730
Speaker 3:  But, but, but that is transformative. I agree, but that doesn't exist yet

372
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,420
Speaker 3:  because like that 500, 600 down is still only in the

373
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:28,320
Speaker 3:  dense urban areas I'm in suburbia. And I don't get that 560 if you're

374
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,050
Speaker 3:  in rural, you're getting two down.

375
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:34,290
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah. I've got like a friend. Who's got a two who is still held onto

376
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:38,070
Speaker 4:  like a to G phone because when he'd be out writing

377
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,790
Speaker 4:  horseback, checking on cattle is cowboy these not

378
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:45,210
Speaker 4:  just random man, checking on cattle.

379
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,710
Speaker 1:  I've got a friend whose hobby is checking on cat. He

380
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:51,670
Speaker 4:  Just likes to look at them and say a lot, but he couldn't get any other

381
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:54,790
Speaker 4:  connections. So if he like fell off his horse or something or hurt himself,

382
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,480
Speaker 4:  the only way to contact his family was with a super old phone. Like 3g didn't

383
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,960
Speaker 4:  work, 4g didn't work. He's just out there with a flip phone

384
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,950
Speaker 4:  and he didn't care that 5g is coming because they still

385
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:09,610
Speaker 4:  haven't really gotten 4g fully in his part of Colorado. So he's like, why

386
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,970
Speaker 4:  I don't, I don't need these speeds cause you'll never get them to me because

387
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,630
Speaker 4:  nobody wants to build the infrastructure to the rural spaces where

388
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,400
Speaker 4:  5g would be transformative.

389
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,240
Speaker 3:  I'm never going to harness our legal legends talent from the rural areas

390
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,120
Speaker 3:  of this country. If we don't fix this connectivity

391
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,450
Speaker 4:  Using so many of the talented league of legend players right

392
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:32,020
Speaker 4:  now, because we cannot properly build out

393
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,130
Speaker 4:  rural,

394
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:37,120
Speaker 1:  But just do the underlying that everyone in area needs 500

395
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,990
Speaker 1:  down there, which is still crazy. We're all going to be wearing the headset.

396
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:44,710
Speaker 1:  It's just like wandering through life. And like real-time VR feeds. Well,

397
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,640
Speaker 1:  you definitely need a fiber connection to all those towers support

398
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,390
Speaker 1:  all of that bandwidth. And like that's the actual problem in these rural

399
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,850
Speaker 1:  areas. And if you can get fiber to the roads, you might as well run the rest

400
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:58,210
Speaker 1:  of the fiber. Cause you already spent so much money. We have done endless

401
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:01,480
Speaker 1:  coverage on this problem on our site, on this podcast, I won't belabor it.

402
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,110
Speaker 1:  I'm just, it's a very nice phone. It's very cool. It comes in multiple colors,

403
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,520
Speaker 1:  including midnight and Starlight.

404
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,370
Speaker 3:  It's not black and not silver. It's not black.

405
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:13,210
Speaker 1:  It's Starlight midnight and Starlight, but it's just hard to not look

406
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:17,110
Speaker 1:  at it and look at the F the entire 5g hype cycle and be

407
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,770
Speaker 1:  like, oh man, like Verizon was just head faking us. And what their

408
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,710
Speaker 1:  5g plan actually was this whole time

409
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:27,370
Speaker 2:  Today, I'm excited to talk about iPad air. We're

410
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,940
Speaker 3:  Bringing the breakthrough M one chip to iPad.

411
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,100
Speaker 1:  Let's talk about the iPad real quick. Cause I think we can get through it

412
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,240
Speaker 1:  really quickly.

413
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,720
Speaker 3:  Again, it is an iPad air that you may be familiar with from

414
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,500
Speaker 3:  2019, same exact appearance. And now it's got an M one inside of it.

415
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,040
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

416
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,910
Speaker 1:  And 5g.

417
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,570
Speaker 3:  And it does have the 5g. It has the same sub six 5g that we've been talking

418
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:50,440
Speaker 3:  about. So it's really like they took the upgrades that the iPad

419
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,070
Speaker 3:  mini got last year and applied them to the air design, except they

420
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:57,250
Speaker 3:  upgraded the processor also all the way up to the , which means that this

421
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:01,120
Speaker 3:  is the same chip in it as the Mac book air as the

422
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,870
Speaker 3:  13 inch MacBook pro as the Mac mini as the iPad pro

423
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:08,830
Speaker 3:  both sizes of the iPad pro. So for 600 bucks, you are

424
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:12,490
Speaker 3:  getting one of Apple's most performance processors that it uses in its

425
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:16,390
Speaker 3:  mainstream, most widely sold laptops, which is pretty incredible. Can you

426
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:19,570
Speaker 3:  do anything with that performance? I mean, it's an iPad,

427
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:23,410
Speaker 3:  so sure. Maybe there's something, well, you can

428
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,660
Speaker 4:  Download your movies real fast,

429
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,110
Speaker 1:  Intelligent

430
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:29,980
Speaker 3:  Movies, real fast, and it's got the center stage front facing camera.

431
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,820
Speaker 3:  So it will, if you're doing video calls, it will automatically follow you,

432
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,630
Speaker 1:  But it's still in the wrong spot, still in the wrong spot. Yes. Baffling

433
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:41,560
Speaker 1:  decision. And it, because you can use this thing as a laptop replacement,

434
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,910
Speaker 1:  as you can with,

435
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:46,730
Speaker 3:  I mean, it's, it works with all of the same accessories as before. So he

436
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,130
Speaker 3:  works with the magic keyboard, works with the smart keyboard. It works with

437
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,910
Speaker 3:  the same pencil, apple confirmed that it is exactly the same dimension. So

438
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,300
Speaker 3:  if you have an old iPad air and have cases and accessories and all that stuff,

439
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,480
Speaker 3:  they're just going to work with this new one right away. There's no, no nothing

440
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,020
Speaker 3:  really new. You need to buy, but it is a 10.9 inch

441
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:07,010
Speaker 3:  screen and it's running iPad a Wes. I do not know how many people would

442
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:10,610
Speaker 3:  really want to use that as their only computing device. If they have an

443
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:14,150
Speaker 3:  opportunity to have a laptop with a larger screen and a more capable

444
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:18,050
Speaker 3:  pro operating system on it. But it looks to be like a very

445
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:21,920
Speaker 3:  nice iPad. The thing that's interesting about it is

446
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,800
Speaker 3:  this kind of happened last time with the last refresh of the iPad air is

447
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,520
Speaker 3:  now it steps on the toes of the iPad pro a lot. And the

448
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,270
Speaker 3:  only differences between the air and the pro 11 inch

449
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,960
Speaker 3:  now are you get promotion or the 120 Hertz screen on the

450
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,800
Speaker 3:  pro you get face ID on the pro and you get a second

451
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,760
Speaker 3:  rear camera and LIDAR sensor on the pro oh, you get four

452
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,580
Speaker 3:  cameras or four speakers instead of two.

453
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,840
Speaker 4:  So

454
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,030
Speaker 1:  I mean, if there's one thing that's going to sell me in slide our sensor

455
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,950
Speaker 1:  and just slide our hang all over town.

456
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:55,400
Speaker 4:  Well, the pro though, the 11 inch pro was always kind of like the ugly

457
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,770
Speaker 4:  stepchild of the lineup because it didn't

458
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,830
Speaker 1:  Get the .

459
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,430
Speaker 4:  I love it. I have, I have the one from the previous

460
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:07,310
Speaker 4:  generation, but it was, it was really frustrating when they announced that

461
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:11,240
Speaker 4:  when they did their last refresh, because really, really cool

462
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,170
Speaker 4:  display in the 12 edge. And then the 11 inch, he was

463
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:19,040
Speaker 4:  like, Nope, you get some, you get faster than the iPad air. Like that

464
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,460
Speaker 4:  was the big difference between it and the iPad air and why I bought it

465
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,270
Speaker 4:  stupidly. But now I feel I've got just a lot of FOMO.

466
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,400
Speaker 4:  This is just me processing my feelings.

467
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,240
Speaker 1:  Well, so you can, you can see the, what they would do in

468
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,050
Speaker 1:  almost any other case would be, they're going to upgrade the iPad pro

469
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:39,890
Speaker 1:  to the mini led display. Maybe still keep the old one in there. That's

470
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:43,490
Speaker 1:  fine. But you get a better display, a better speakers, one more

471
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,580
Speaker 1:  camera, face ID and LIDAR who doesn't love

472
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,610
Speaker 4:  LIDAR. We have to wait like a year and a half for that to happen.

473
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:52,790
Speaker 1:  All the rumors are that the, the mini led is still too

474
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:56,390
Speaker 1:  expensive. So I do think it's stuck in the middle. You

475
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:00,080
Speaker 1:  know, the price difference is vanishingly small, right?

476
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,010
Speaker 3:  Between the 11 pro and the iPad air is 200 bucks, but

477
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:07,550
Speaker 3:  you do get twice the storage and the probe. So the air, this is like the

478
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:10,670
Speaker 3:  one criticism I have against the air is that they are still keeping it at

479
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:14,300
Speaker 3:  64 gigs in the base storage. And then getting more storage is

480
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,190
Speaker 3:  $150 upgrade to 2 56.

481
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,220
Speaker 1:  They absolutely have done that on purpose, right? That's the one that's

482
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:26,210
Speaker 1:  where they know that if you spend $150 to get the storage, you might as

483
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,230
Speaker 1:  well just buy the pro.

484
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:32,030
Speaker 3:  I mean, it's like it gets this annoying, like matrix because the

485
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:35,990
Speaker 3:  $150 that you spend on the air gets you 256 gigs of storage.

486
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:39,950
Speaker 3:  And the pro starts at 1 28. So you aren't getting as much with the pro,

487
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:43,380
Speaker 3:  but I think most people on an iPad are going to be perfectly fine with 108

488
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,220
Speaker 3:  gigs, 64 gigs might be pushing it. If you are trying

489
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,060
Speaker 3:  to actually replace a laptop with this kind of thing,

490
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,930
Speaker 3:  if all you're doing is like iPads stuff, tablets stuff, you

491
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:58,680
Speaker 3:  know, I think 64 would probably be cover you. But if you are trying to

492
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,650
Speaker 3:  replace your main computer or trying to make it your main computer, you're

493
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:05,430
Speaker 3:  probably going to run into some issues with storage. I

494
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:09,240
Speaker 3:  think gets you an impact is like 16 gigs. So, you know, there's a

495
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,480
Speaker 3:  quarter of your storage gone if you play that game. So it's, it's a little

496
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,140
Speaker 3:  frustrating that they've kept that storage level, but like you said, it is,

497
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,500
Speaker 3:  it seems perfectly designed to get you to be like, well, if I'm going to

498
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,500
Speaker 3:  spend the upgrade, I might as well spend a little more and get the pro and

499
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,590
Speaker 3:  the other nice features because I will say face ID on the iPad. I think I

500
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:28,980
Speaker 3:  said this last week face ID on the iPad is a lot nicer than touch ID on the

501
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,760
Speaker 3:  iPad.

502
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,940
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I answered apple is historically very smart at being

503
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,720
Speaker 1:  like, no matter how many dollars you have, we will have a

504
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,230
Speaker 1:  product within $50 of how many dollars you have, right? Like, you know, either

505
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:44,100
Speaker 1:  direction, you just tell us an amount of dollars and we have an

506
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,700
Speaker 1:  iOS device for you. Right? And like, I think there's a little bit of muddle

507
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,360
Speaker 1:  there because right. The, the upgrade cycles are not

508
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,300
Speaker 1:  perfectly aligned, but I think it's part of that as chip shortage. I do think

509
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,750
Speaker 1:  all the rumors about the display technology not getting cheaper fast enough

510
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:01,660
Speaker 1:  is real. They're the only company shipping many led screens. Like

511
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,430
Speaker 1:  at scale,

512
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:06,150
Speaker 3:  I have a very harebrained theory that does not have a lot

513
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,750
Speaker 3:  of evidence backing it off, but I was very

514
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:13,350
Speaker 3:  surprised when they announced the M one ship was coming into the air and

515
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,950
Speaker 3:  they were just using the eight 15 because the predictable thing was the last

516
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:20,640
Speaker 3:  one, used a 14, I believe. And so this one would have the eight,

517
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,390
Speaker 3:  15, and the iPad mini had the eight 15 a and they just went straight up to

518
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:28,290
Speaker 3:  the M one. And my theory is Apple's producing

519
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,650
Speaker 3:  as many a fifteens as it possibly can. And it's putting them in all the I-phones

520
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,950
Speaker 3:  like we just said, it's in the iPhone se it's in all the iPhone models. And

521
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:38,370
Speaker 3:  so it is reserving them for that and figured it could just put the M one

522
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:41,700
Speaker 3:  in the air because it, now it doesn't have to take stock away from the

523
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,170
Speaker 3:  iPhones. And

524
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:45,690
Speaker 1:  This is based on the fact that the mini is almost impossible yet.

525
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,140
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Mini's really hard to get. And there's been a lot of reporting that

526
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,980
Speaker 3:  apple was diverting production to the mini towards the iPhone so

527
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,230
Speaker 3:  that it could keep up with demands for the iPhone,

528
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:58,920
Speaker 1:  Anything on it, all that said this on our earnings call trip shortages finally

529
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,250
Speaker 1:  sort of caught up to them. This is all by the way, you have to wear a tie

530
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,650
Speaker 1:  with this event, they're putting eight 13 in the display. So it's

531
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:09,240
Speaker 1:  like, I think it's catching up to them in an extremely odd

532
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,720
Speaker 1:  ways. Right. They're just making as much as they can

533
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,750
Speaker 3:  Until they have to just use a series chips for like all the little, little

534
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,900
Speaker 3:  things like, like the display controller and the iPad is now in a

535
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,850
Speaker 3:  13.

536
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:24,300
Speaker 1:  Yeah. For no reason. So I do think there's a little bit of awareness there.

537
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,170
Speaker 1:  I don't know that M ones are not also constrained. Like

538
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:31,800
Speaker 1:  they're making, they're selling every Mac that they can, but the

539
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,580
Speaker 3:  Is based on the 14. Right? So it's got a

540
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,270
Speaker 3:  longer life cycle in terms of development for that process.

541
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,800
Speaker 3:  Whereas a 15 is a new process. They only

542
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,440
Speaker 1:  Started a new process. Know what you mean? Yeah, exactly.

543
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,260
Speaker 3:  So that's where my theories come from. Like I said, I could be way off and,

544
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:51,670
Speaker 3:  and I don't have like actual hard evidence backing this up, but it, it, it

545
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:55,540
Speaker 3:  kind of slots together if you squint really closely.

546
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,080
Speaker 3:  And

547
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,810
Speaker 1:  If you've been drinking, this makes a lot of sense.

548
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:02,770
Speaker 4:  The other theory is this is all just a long lead up to

549
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,480
Speaker 4:  killing iPad with.

550
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,960
Speaker 1:  That's not a theory. That's just your fond hope. I've not heard this theory.

551
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,470
Speaker 1:  I would like to hear this. This is Alex. Just, you're just a manifesting.

552
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:15,460
Speaker 4:  I don't believe it. I fully do not believe it, but I was hearing it a

553
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,550
Speaker 4:  lot the last couple of days. And people being like, oh, this is all just,

554
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:22,150
Speaker 4:  they put the one in there. Just put Macko S on it, be done with it, kill

555
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,920
Speaker 4:  iPad. O S

556
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,910
Speaker 1:  They're never going to you're 1000% manifesting. Like I

557
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,050
Speaker 1:  wanted them to do that,

558
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:32,980
Speaker 4:  But I do I a little bit feel iPad. iOS has a short

559
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,950
Speaker 4:  lifespan now, because one in one, right. That's

560
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:40,720
Speaker 4:  that's on all the, most of the major iPads with the exception of the

561
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,020
Speaker 4:  original iPad and the iPad mini, right? Yes.

562
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:47,320
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And then the other thing is we're going to get a folding device at

563
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,770
Speaker 4:  some point, right? We're going to get, we're going to get a full list. We're

564
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:54,670
Speaker 4:  going to get a folding device and it's got to either run iOS or iPad

565
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:58,090
Speaker 4:  iOS. It can't run both. So you're not going to kill

566
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,620
Speaker 4:  iOS.

567
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,430
Speaker 3:  And I always had the

568
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:05,020
Speaker 3:  same

569
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:05,160
Speaker 3:  But

570
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,630
Speaker 4:  The Apple's going to have to explain that, and they're just going to kill

571
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,040
Speaker 4:  it. They're just going to take care of,

572
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,910
Speaker 1:  We're not going to kill it. We talked to a bunch of folks after the event

573
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:16,750
Speaker 1:  and their position. Cause I asked very directly like, Hey, you used to

574
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,630
Speaker 1:  run around telling us that the iPad was the future of

575
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:23,140
Speaker 1:  computing. And you took your eye off the Mac and you've admitted it. You

576
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:26,590
Speaker 1:  had meetings with people to be like, we are sorry. We forgot about the

577
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:29,800
Speaker 1:  Macintosh because you were all in on the app. Like this was a real thing

578
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,520
Speaker 1:  that happened apple. And Apple's pretty direct about it. They had the

579
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,070
Speaker 1:  meetings and say, we took our eye off the mat, and now they're putting out

580
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:39,910
Speaker 1:  Macs that everybody's wanted forever. And I get that happened, but

581
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:43,390
Speaker 1:  everybody buys a Mac, buys an iPad. And it's still our vision

582
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:47,170
Speaker 1:  of what this kind of computing could be like.

583
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:51,130
Speaker 1:  They are in no way trying to blur those lines. Like if you

584
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:55,060
Speaker 1:  are apple, you're Tim cook. And you're like, so my choices are, I can

585
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:58,930
Speaker 1:  sell people to computers or one. They're always

586
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:02,560
Speaker 1:  going to pick two because that is currently what's happening. People like

587
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,040
Speaker 1:  the amount of, I own every product in the apple, apple

588
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,030
Speaker 1:  ecosystem is the envy of the computing world. And so I just, at some

589
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:13,270
Speaker 1:  point, yep, the lines are getting real blurry and Apple's going to be like,

590
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:17,260
Speaker 1:  well, are they blurry enough for you to buy two computers or one?

591
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:21,010
Speaker 1:  And keep you buying two. They're just going to keep you buying

592
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,770
Speaker 4:  Two, one day, man, it's going to happen.

593
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:27,040
Speaker 1:  They're going to keep, I think, tried to kill the Mac is what I'm

594
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,780
Speaker 1:  saying.

595
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,880
Speaker 3:  They did everything in their power. They put a terrible keyboard in it. They

596
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,740
Speaker 3:  took all the ports away it over here. People

597
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,900
Speaker 3:  still want this. What would we have to do to kill this product?

598
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,710
Speaker 1:  Yeah. That original Mac book air, or the, I guess it was a second-generation

599
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:46,610
Speaker 1:  aggregator. They just persisted in that design forever.

600
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:49,970
Speaker 1:  Like literally their, their stated explanation was people won't stop buying

601
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:53,570
Speaker 1:  this. They're like, no retina

602
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,270
Speaker 1:  display like ancient processor,

603
00:32:56,270 --> 00:33:00,230
Speaker 4:  Like 14 by 900

604
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,090
Speaker 3:  Had mini display port on it.

605
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:05,120
Speaker 1:  And people like, they were just like, we don't know. We're like, it's cause

606
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,480
Speaker 1:  it's the only good back. Like everything else is kind of a

607
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,470
Speaker 1:  disaster. So like, I think that they are, they're pretty

608
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:16,430
Speaker 1:  committed to not necessarily iPad OS,

609
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:19,850
Speaker 1:  but I think they're committed to their strategy of selling more

610
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:20,810
Speaker 3:  Stuff,

611
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:24,650
Speaker 1:  More computers, selling more. They were very committed to the strategy of

612
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:28,430
Speaker 1:  selling more computers that we know for sure.

613
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,830
Speaker 1:  It's very sincere that they would like you to buy

614
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:34,520
Speaker 1:  more, no confusion there. But I think they

615
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,790
Speaker 1:  are actually committed to the Mac is this

616
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:41,660
Speaker 1:  platform where like pros

617
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:45,530
Speaker 1:  make pro stuff and lots of consumers want consumer max

618
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:49,430
Speaker 1:  to work from home. And we've got this vision

619
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:52,820
Speaker 1:  of a, another kind of computer where every button pays us

620
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:56,390
Speaker 1:  30% of every dollar, like right. And like, they're just gonna

621
00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:00,270
Speaker 1:  keep rolling in that direction for a long time. But I,

622
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,540
Speaker 1:  I hope you speak this into truth.

623
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,500
Speaker 4:  I just feel like we're, we're careening towards an end game. Like Apple's

624
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,430
Speaker 4:  going to have to lay

625
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:07,880
Speaker 1:  For so

626
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,360
Speaker 4:  Long when the folding iPad comes, when the full or folding whatever

627
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,050
Speaker 4:  comes, that will be the moment. Like that will be the moment. We're all.

628
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:18,830
Speaker 4:  We're all gonna be like, wait a minute, wait a minute. iPad. OOS is

629
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:22,760
Speaker 4:  just a rescreened iOS. Why are we doing two of these?

630
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,300
Speaker 4:  It's dumb. And like, it's coming and we're going to have to kill it.

631
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:30,020
Speaker 1:  We'll see. Well, what's your prediction. When a folding apple

632
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,420
Speaker 1:  product comes, I think if ever

633
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,690
Speaker 4:  It's like a year or two, right. Where we keep hearing, maybe even next

634
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,070
Speaker 4:  year,

635
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:40,610
Speaker 3:  I thought the last reporting was like 20, 24, 20, 25.

636
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:44,510
Speaker 4:  But I need, I need it now. Like Samsung did

637
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:48,500
Speaker 4:  it Samsung. It's usually Samsung does it at an apple. Does it? Three years

638
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,730
Speaker 4:  later

639
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:52,940
Speaker 3:  We have, we have history to lean on. Right? The galaxy note came out in

640
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:56,210
Speaker 3:  2011, proving that big phones were something people

641
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:59,960
Speaker 3:  wanted. And three years later apple had the iPhone six

642
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,430
Speaker 3:  plus.

643
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:01,820
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

644
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:05,300
Speaker 3:  But three years from the galaxy full launch would be like now, so that doesn't

645
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,520
Speaker 3:  like work. If you use that logic,

646
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,040
Speaker 4:  That's what I said, they're there, they're behind. So it's going to be, it's

647
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,320
Speaker 4:  going to be next year. I'm manifesting that part.

648
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,830
Speaker 1:  The apple feels like they're behind. I think they're looking at Samsung fully

649
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:19,430
Speaker 1:  feeling like they're being the phones are good, but Samsung is like,

650
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,480
Speaker 1:  yeah,

651
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,870
Speaker 4:  Apple's looking at his record sales. And it's like, wait, we don't have to

652
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,220
Speaker 4:  do that.

653
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:28,910
Speaker 1:  I do not think they feel pressure. Like Lisa said the slot, like new

654
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,550
Speaker 1:  form factors at what prompts people to switch.

655
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:34,130
Speaker 4:  Right. Oh man, that means we're going to have to like, it's going to be like

656
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:37,320
Speaker 4:  four or five years. Cause the Mac mini just came out.

657
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,870
Speaker 5:  Oh, this is upsetting.

658
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:43,620
Speaker 1:  I have to leave this cast. I'll talk to you later. If you're, I just don't

659
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:47,310
Speaker 1:  think the iPhone team is looking at any of Samsung's foldables and like

660
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:51,210
Speaker 1:  quake and then they're good.

661
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:55,170
Speaker 1:  Phones are very cool. I'm not denigrating them. I just think no one

662
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:58,080
Speaker 1:  is switching in that direction. Right? This was the sat they said about the

663
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,800
Speaker 1:  se, right? We've like attracted more new customers, the iPhone with these

664
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,640
Speaker 1:  products and ever before. And as long as they can just like wedge a

665
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,570
Speaker 1:  message into the American discourse. They're good.

666
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,670
Speaker 1:  The phones Nashville. Okay. We should take a break. We, I don't know how

667
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,630
Speaker 1:  we got to. I message. Everything just leads to

668
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:19,620
Speaker 1:  blue bubbles. I am not to blame Ivan. I have this theory about like things

669
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:23,040
Speaker 1:  the verge believes. And that's just on my list is that the

670
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,760
Speaker 1:  entire phone market is like distorted by a

671
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,540
Speaker 1:  message. And we all know it and we can't, you can't just like

672
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:34,080
Speaker 1:  walk the streets, proclaiming this. Like everyone will be like, who are you?

673
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:38,010
Speaker 1:  Like we're just in Cinnabon. Leave us alone.

674
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:40,740
Speaker 1:  But it's extremely true. Okay. We've got to take a break. We're gonna come

675
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,420
Speaker 1:  back and talk about this Mac. We'll be right

676
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:46,410
Speaker 1:  back.

677
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:49,650
Speaker 1:  It's 2007 and people are hustling. Two roommates need some cash. They start

678
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:52,380
Speaker 1:  renting an air mattress in their apartment. Strangers stay with them. Those

679
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,860
Speaker 1:  roommates earn some extra spending money and Airbnb is born. What happened

680
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,460
Speaker 1:  next? That company exploded with rentals available in more than 100,000

681
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,210
Speaker 1:  cities. One of those cities was prepared to go to battle on behalf of renters

682
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:07,110
Speaker 1:  and hotels to keep Airbnb at bay business wars wonder is a

683
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:10,680
Speaker 1:  podcast that looks at the world's biggest company rivals their new season,

684
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,370
Speaker 1:  Airbnb versus New York city examines. How that struggle became a symbol for

685
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:18,000
Speaker 1:  the tug of war, between startups and regulators. What started as a clever

686
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,090
Speaker 1:  way to learn a little extra cash quickly transformed into something a lot

687
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:24,690
Speaker 1:  more complicated, which begins to impact the housing and rental markets.

688
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,960
Speaker 1:  When New York city officials decided to curb down the expansion of Airbnb

689
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,170
Speaker 1:  into the city, the tech giant refused to back down. And that's when things

690
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:34,470
Speaker 1:  got really interesting. Listen to business wars on apple podcasts, Amazon

Speaker 1:  app,

693
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:43,410
Speaker 5:  Important conversations around what it means to be a professional or happening

694
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:46,950
Speaker 5:  right now on LinkedIn members are talking about things like adding flexibility

695
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:50,400
Speaker 5:  to where and how we work. They're talking honestly about taking time away

696
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,150
Speaker 5:  from work, to focus on their families and mental health, because those things

697
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:57,300
Speaker 5:  should not stuck to career development and showing up to work on our own

698
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:01,290
Speaker 5:  terms. As our full selves, isn't an impediment to growth. It's actually the

699
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:04,770
Speaker 5:  key to unlocking it. LinkedIn members are adding vital new information to

700
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:07,860
Speaker 5:  their job. Titles and workers everywhere are defining themselves more

701
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,700
Speaker 5:  completely. There are radio hosts slash activist slash moms,

702
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,090
Speaker 5:  finance managers slash poets slash dog dads. And so many

703
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:19,080
Speaker 5:  more professional is our acidifying. So if your LinkedIn doesn't

704
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,530
Speaker 5:  reflect who you really are, update your job title, post your

705
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:26,340
Speaker 5:  truth, show the world, the authentic professional you and

706
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,610
Speaker 5:  join the conversations redefining professional on LinkedIn,

707
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:30,780
Speaker 5:  LinkedIn welcome

708
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:41,800
Speaker 5:  professionals.

709
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,540
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. This

710
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,270
Speaker 7:  Is Mac studio and studio.

711
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:50,050
Speaker 1:  I am very excited about this Mac, the Mac studio, new Mac got a

712
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:53,290
Speaker 1:  new chip in it. It's basically just a tall Mac mini. It looks like a

713
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:57,130
Speaker 1:  toaster. So a bunch of ports has got, it's got a two USB

714
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:00,340
Speaker 1:  C or Thunderbolt ports, depending on the chip. We'll talk about that SD card

715
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:04,060
Speaker 1:  on the front front facing ports from facing towards fan. What a

716
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,390
Speaker 1:  beautiful thing. All kinds of IO, new chips. I'll

717
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:11,230
Speaker 1:  just preface this. I will say this weekend, we're going to have Jason

718
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:14,830
Speaker 1:  Snell he's to run Macworld magazine. I have a piece on the site about the

719
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:18,760
Speaker 1:  history of people demanding a product. Exactly

720
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,630
Speaker 1:  like this from apple, like easily, since the nineties,

721
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:26,500
Speaker 1:  can you ship a mid range, powerful tower

722
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,430
Speaker 1:  ish computer with a lot of IO that we can just bring

723
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:34,240
Speaker 1:  our own monitor and keyboard to like since the nineties, like, it's

724
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,840
Speaker 1:  hilarious how long people have wanted something exactly in the slot from

725
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:41,830
Speaker 1:  apple and it, you know, who wrote the headline and site

726
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:45,100
Speaker 1:  was a John that's. Apple's just doing what people want now. Yes. Yes. Like

727
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,830
Speaker 1:  that's their whole max strategy is like, what do people always wanted? We

728
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:51,760
Speaker 1:  should make this things. So like, I, I am excited

729
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,510
Speaker 1:  about that just because it's interesting to see

730
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:59,230
Speaker 1:  apple just deliver a thing that people have wanted for easily

731
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:03,040
Speaker 1:  20 years. There's they've never made a product like this

732
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,880
Speaker 4:  Mac book, like the refreshed Mac book, air, the MacBook pro they're

733
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,390
Speaker 4:  like, oh wait, if we actually give computer users what they're

734
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:13,810
Speaker 4:  requesting, they will buy computers from us.

735
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:17,080
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I mean, I think, I think that came to like the most

736
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,980
Speaker 3:  clear way with the MacBook pros last year, right? Like people were

737
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:24,460
Speaker 3:  waiting for so long to buy Mac book pros and then apple finally rolled out

738
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:28,270
Speaker 3:  everything. Everyone was been asking for in MacBook pros and everybody bought

739
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:29,440
Speaker 3:  them.

740
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,370
Speaker 1:  My M one pro 16 inch Macro-Pro is by far

741
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:36,580
Speaker 1:  the best computer I've ever had. Yeah. Without a doubt, no

742
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:40,450
Speaker 1:  questions. I've there. I've had many stupid

743
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:44,080
Speaker 1:  computers. I've many computers I've been very fond of, but this is just by

744
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,740
Speaker 1:  far the most capable computer. That's great. But what's

745
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,080
Speaker 1:  interesting to me about this is this is the first time they've done it in

746
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,950
Speaker 1:  a new category where people were demanding as apple enter a category.

747
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:57,820
Speaker 1:  They were not in for 20 years. The last time that they made a

748
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,680
Speaker 1:  computer, like this was the G4 Q

749
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,340
Speaker 7:  This is a stunning product, quite possibly the most beautiful

750
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:07,300
Speaker 7:  product we've ever designed. The computer is in an eight inch queue

751
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,840
Speaker 7:  and it's suspended in a stunning crystal clear and close.

752
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,680
Speaker 4:  It was actually a terrible, terrible device, but it looked so

753
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,220
Speaker 4:  cool.

754
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:19,030
Speaker 1:  It looks so cool. And I worked in the, when I was in college, I was like,

755
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:22,720
Speaker 1:  the, it support the science library. It was great. It was a great job.

756
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,980
Speaker 4:  You had all the G4S, the little cube.

757
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,670
Speaker 1:  We had tons of little cubes. I mean, that job was like, sit around and do

758
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:30,760
Speaker 1:  your homework for like 12 bucks an hour. It was great. It was an amazing

759
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,490
Speaker 1:  job out of college, but people would like lose a file or they would get

760
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:36,420
Speaker 1:  confused or like they couldn't figure out a plan. And then he was like, go

761
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:40,220
Speaker 1:  help him in the science library, it was full of G4 cubes. And so

762
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,770
Speaker 1:  everyone would sit down and they get all excited and they would put their

763
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:46,730
Speaker 1:  papers on top of the cube on the top. So it blocked the vet and

764
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:49,310
Speaker 1:  the thing would overheat and it would shut down in the middle of the work.

765
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:52,550
Speaker 1:  And so we had to put signs on the G4 cubes to be like, do not put shit on

766
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:55,400
Speaker 1:  top of this computer thoroughly ruined the aesthetic of the entire thing.

767
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,800
Speaker 1:  Anyway, that's the last time apple has ever made anything like that.

768
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,860
Speaker 3:  Notably the vents are on the back of the

769
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,900
Speaker 3:  bed. Can not the top.

770
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:06,110
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Eric comes in, there's two fans, air comes in from the bottom, the

771
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,300
Speaker 1:  fan spin. They go out. It's like 20,000.

772
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:12,020
Speaker 3:  It's basically the same concept as the Mac mini, just bigger with more

773
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:15,020
Speaker 3:  fans and a bigger heat sink area, but same

774
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,910
Speaker 4:  Flow and bigger processors.

775
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,220
Speaker 1:  Yeah. We'll get into those. Yeah. I'm just saying it's the first time they've

776
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,700
Speaker 1:  entered a category that people demanding for 20 years after this one,

777
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,600
Speaker 1:  notorious failure was Steve jobs announced that the queue

778
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,230
Speaker 1:  was only putting put on hiatus by saying it was going on ice because it was

779
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:33,770
Speaker 1:  a cube. So now it's back. It's not on HIAs anymore. It's

780
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:37,700
Speaker 1:  back. This thing looks, you know, people are excited about it. It is basically

781
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,540
Speaker 1:  the replacement for the iMac pro. I would like to say, it's paired

782
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:44,000
Speaker 1:  with this studio display, which has

783
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,990
Speaker 1:  1599. And then it's got these chips in it, which actually

784
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:51,980
Speaker 1:  really changed the pricing. So the base models and one max,

785
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:55,550
Speaker 1:  same as the 16 inch tweet we know and love the same as the 16 inch

786
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:58,850
Speaker 1:  MacBook pro that configuration costs

787
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:02,690
Speaker 1:  $2,000. Yes. And then there's a new chip called the <em></em>

788
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:06,230
Speaker 1:  ultra, which is effectively two M one. Max is stitched

789
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:09,200
Speaker 1:  together, which we should talk about. And that configuration starts at

790
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,640
Speaker 1:  $4,000.

791
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,120
Speaker 3:  Yeah, you can, you can like whittle it down a little bit and get it for like

792
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:18,050
Speaker 3:  3,800, if you're willing to go with five, 12 gigs of storage instead of

793
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:19,280
Speaker 3:  one terabyte. But everything in

794
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,200
Speaker 1:  These computers is soldered in. So

795
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,320
Speaker 3:  Like, yeah, you probably should just spend the 200 bucks. If you're spending

796
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:28,160
Speaker 3:  3,800, you probably should just spend the 200 to get at least a terabyte

797
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,980
Speaker 3:  of storage in it. So, yeah, but it's kind of funny because it's like the

798
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:34,850
Speaker 3:  base model, a Mac studio, it comes with the M

799
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:38,810
Speaker 3:  one max 32 gigs of Ram and five 12 gigs of storage for two

800
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:42,710
Speaker 3:  grand. And then for four grand, you get the <em></em> ultra,

801
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:46,700
Speaker 3:  which is two M one maxes. You get 64 gigs of Ram

802
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,920
Speaker 3:  and one terabyte of storage. So you get two of

803
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,070
Speaker 3:  everything

804
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:53,210
Speaker 4:  That makes sense.

805
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:55,940
Speaker 1:  I like it. So Alex, this, this chip is like fascinating. The

806
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,710
Speaker 1:  ultra.

807
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:01,700
Speaker 4:  I think Tom Warren did a great piece about this too. Probably the

808
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,570
Speaker 4:  most interesting thing about it is the ultra fusion tech, which

809
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:09,290
Speaker 4:  is what's allowing them to stitch two processors together

810
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:12,410
Speaker 4:  because like everybody's kind of started embracing something called triplet

811
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:15,950
Speaker 4:  design where you take lots of little smaller components, put them together,

812
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:19,430
Speaker 4:  make a big, fast chip. I think just last

813
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:23,120
Speaker 4:  week there was a new standard announced for triplet design Hein wrote a wonderful

814
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,960
Speaker 4:  piece about it. So Apple's like not using that same standard. They're

815
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,590
Speaker 4:  focusing on this thing called ultra fusion tech, which is more like

816
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:34,560
Speaker 4:  AMD's infinity fabric. And if you don't, if you've never heard

817
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,010
Speaker 4:  of AMD is infinity fabric, it's why you've probably been hearing all about

818
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:41,760
Speaker 4:  AMD for the last couple of years. This is absolutely was a huge game changer

819
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,450
Speaker 4:  for AMD when they rolled it out with the new Ryzen

820
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:49,350
Speaker 4:  chips, like when the Ryzen line launched huge, huge game

821
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:52,860
Speaker 4:  changer. And it just allowed the D various triplets to communicate really

822
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:56,580
Speaker 4:  quickly. And it allowed them to start being really competitive with

823
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:00,570
Speaker 4:  Intel in the integrated CPU space, because they could integrate

824
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:04,440
Speaker 4:  and have those, the GPU and the CPU talk faster than an

825
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,220
Speaker 4:  Intel product could Apple's is 2.5

826
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:12,060
Speaker 4:  terabytes of bandwidth between the two sides. And that's just

827
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:16,050
Speaker 4:  like unreal. That is so much faster. They're, they're

828
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:19,590
Speaker 4:  basically faster than the infinity fabric. They're basically

829
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:22,920
Speaker 4:  faster than NVIDIA's like

830
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,190
Speaker 4:  comparative product, which is called link in

831
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:29,790
Speaker 4:  feeling. And it's just, it's wild. And it's

832
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:33,600
Speaker 4:  neat. Tom talked about how it's aiming to be

833
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:37,320
Speaker 4:  the NVIDIA's RTX 30, 90. I don't quite agree with him

834
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:41,280
Speaker 4:  there because I think most people are still

835
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,030
Speaker 4:  buying GPU's are those like 30 nineties and stuff

836
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:48,450
Speaker 4:  are gamers for the most part.

837
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:52,200
Speaker 4:  And apple, I say this as someone who tried to build a

838
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,770
Speaker 4:  gaming beat around apple in the late two

839
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:59,400
Speaker 4:  thousands. Wow. Do you know, I'm not famous for it? And there's a

840
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,960
Speaker 4:  reason.

841
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,740
Speaker 3:  So apple made the claim with the M one pro and what max

842
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:08,630
Speaker 3:  launched that it was comparable to an RTX 30, 60. And we found out that

843
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:12,390
Speaker 3:  that was not really the case with any reasonable

844
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:15,300
Speaker 3:  tests that you might do. So now they're making the claim against the 30 90

845
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,490
Speaker 3:  with the ultra we're going to have to do

846
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:21,150
Speaker 1:  So with this trip, I w the claims are hard to even

847
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:24,990
Speaker 1:  describe, right? They did the thing again, where they put up a bunch of

848
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:28,860
Speaker 1:  graphs, the graphs, the, if they have labels at all, a lot of the

849
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:32,700
Speaker 1:  graphs are like, it's 3.7 X faster than a 27 inch

850
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:36,240
Speaker 1:  iMac. And the 27 inch iMac has a bar that goes to a hundred. And

851
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,990
Speaker 1:  then the other graph is just longer. So it's like extra

852
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:43,950
Speaker 1:  vibes and then it's longer, but it's also more colorful. So

853
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:47,700
Speaker 1:  if that speaks to you and you, you know how to test that, let me know. Cause

854
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,820
Speaker 1:  we're, you know, we had to figure it out. The other graphs are like the classic

855
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:53,760
Speaker 1:  power performance graphs that apple does. It's relative

856
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,650
Speaker 3:  Performance versus blotted.

857
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:58,830
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And so they measure the Watts and then give you relative performance

858
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:02,520
Speaker 1:  in tiny print on those graphs, which flashed by

859
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,060
Speaker 1:  extraordinarily fast, during this already extremely

860
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:10,020
Speaker 1:  fast event, you find out that it's a 30, 90, you find out that, you know,

861
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:13,410
Speaker 1:  it's a various PCs that are powerful, but it's

862
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:17,340
Speaker 1:  impossible to know what they're running. Yeah. So like, if, if

863
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:21,240
Speaker 1:  we are reviewing the same, we want to like verify their claim. I don't

864
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,630
Speaker 1:  even know what to do.

865
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:26,370
Speaker 4:  It could be like, it's faster than the 30, 90 at the AI

866
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:30,220
Speaker 4:  test on civilization six, you know, like cool. That

867
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,830
Speaker 4:  only tests the CPU that was

868
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:35,080
Speaker 3:  Faster than 30, 90 at running final cut

869
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,780
Speaker 3:  pro.

870
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:41,080
Speaker 1:  So it's just like, oh, that is just like hard to understand. What I will

871
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,930
Speaker 1:  say about this ship is that I think that the fundamental technology is very

872
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:47,620
Speaker 1:  cool. There's because apple makes both the hardware in the

873
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:51,490
Speaker 1:  software and it doesn't nothing else runs than these chips, except I pad

874
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:55,360
Speaker 1:  iOS, I guess. But like they make all that too.

875
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,720
Speaker 1:  They are able to abstract the fact that it's

876
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,710
Speaker 1:  triplets in that way in a way that other companies cannot.

877
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:05,950
Speaker 1:  So like a lot of like metal, the graphics system, the Maxwell

878
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:09,940
Speaker 1:  metal metal developers were freaking out about a tweet from an apple

879
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:13,840
Speaker 1:  engineer. Who's like the M one ultra only presents one metal

880
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:17,800
Speaker 1:  interface. Like it's not two GPU's to your software.

881
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,730
Speaker 1:  It's only, it's just one ship. That's extremely powerful. That is

882
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:24,550
Speaker 1:  somewhat revolutionary. And it's one, one

883
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:25,180
Speaker 3:  Pool of

884
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:29,080
Speaker 1:  Shared unified memory. And that, and that's crazy. So if you can get 128

885
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,560
Speaker 1:  gigs of memory to a GPU, like no one has ever been able to do that, you get

886
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:36,010
Speaker 1:  128 gigs of memory to a CPU that runs as fast as graphics

887
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:39,790
Speaker 1:  memory. No, one's able to do that. I will say. And I asked about this

888
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:43,660
Speaker 1:  and we're just going to have to see Apple's big bet has been on

889
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:47,620
Speaker 1:  this unified memory architecture. Yeah. And with the early and

890
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:51,190
Speaker 1:  ones that only ship just gigs of Ram, people do just run out of

891
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:54,820
Speaker 1:  memory, right? Like the video card and the CPU are competing for memory and

892
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:58,390
Speaker 1:  you can just max it out, which is not something you're used to on a modern

893
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:02,320
Speaker 1:  computer at 128 gigs. And I ran up, I'll try it. Like if

894
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:06,070
Speaker 1:  you're are doing gigantic 3d scenes or you're doing this other

895
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:08,740
Speaker 1:  memory intensive stuff, like, I think I have to order is gonna have to be

896
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:12,700
Speaker 1:  careful. It's unclear if apple reserves Ram for the

897
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,690
Speaker 1:  system like that stuff is just, it's a big bet that is now playing out

898
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:19,270
Speaker 1:  at the high end of the market. We've already kind of see how it plays out

899
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:20,110
Speaker 1:  at the low end.

900
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:23,890
Speaker 4:  We're singing in that base model studio too. Right? Like most people's

901
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:27,880
Speaker 4:  base model stuff is still say eight or 16 gigs like

902
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,710
Speaker 4:  windows PCs and stuff. They're all going to be in

903
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:31,720
Speaker 3:  The studios is starting at 32.

904
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:35,620
Speaker 4:  Right. And that's what I mean is the studio is starting at 32 gigs because

905
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:39,370
Speaker 4:  this is a little bit more memory hungry, like set

906
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:43,300
Speaker 4:  up than an Intel or an AMD processor.

907
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,330
Speaker 4:  So I think apple is very like cognizant of it. That's what I felt like I

908
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:49,840
Speaker 4:  was winning when I saw I was not going to have to pay extra for 32 gigabytes

909
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:53,410
Speaker 4:  of Ram. I was like, Ooh, a surprise for me. And I was like,

910
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:57,010
Speaker 4:  oh, actually I need it. I'm going to really need

911
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:57,520
Speaker 4:  it.

912
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:01,480
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So I think this computer, it's the first computer of

913
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,020
Speaker 1:  this kind we've seen from apple with M one chips in it. Yes, the macro crows

914
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:08,980
Speaker 1:  exists, but in the context, people are going to use this computer. I think

915
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:12,940
Speaker 1:  the memory issue will be more complicated. I don't think it'll be bad.

916
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:16,630
Speaker 1:  I think it's just going to play out differently because this is a professional

917
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:19,840
Speaker 1:  desktop machine and people are going to do that kind of stuff with it. So

918
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,480
Speaker 1:  we'll see. It's a, it is a huge bet. What is interesting?

919
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,540
Speaker 3:  And to me is that, like you said, Apple's saying this is going to show up

920
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:28,820
Speaker 3:  as one processor in the systems and will show up as one processor, one pool

921
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:32,780
Speaker 3:  of memory, one GPU to the apps that

922
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:36,470
Speaker 3:  access it. But you get all the benefits of two

923
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:40,460
Speaker 3:  processors because you get twice the head room for memory. So now, you know,

924
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:43,940
Speaker 3:  you start at 64, you have 1 28 as an option. You can only go to

925
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:47,820
Speaker 3:  64 on the max. So if you have two maxes, now you've got 1

926
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:51,260
Speaker 3:  28. And it quite literally is a north and south bridge. That memory that

927
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:55,190
Speaker 3:  is like a pool of 64 and a pool of 64 that's blended together. Then

928
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:59,030
Speaker 3:  you get more Thunderbolt ports on the IO with the ultra,

929
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:02,990
Speaker 3:  because it has more lanes of PCI bandwidth because it is two chips

930
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:05,870
Speaker 3:  as opposed to one that are fused together. So it's, it's, you're like getting

931
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:08,840
Speaker 3:  a little benefits of having two processors, but you're also getting all the

932
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,680
Speaker 3:  benefits of one super fast processor

933
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,520
Speaker 3:  that can communicate very quickly between all of these lanes of,

934
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:20,510
Speaker 3:  of memory and, and whatnot. So it's a pretty fascinating set

935
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:21,440
Speaker 3:  set up.

936
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,370
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And I will say apple is very clear. This is the last chip in the

937
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:29,360
Speaker 1:  M one family. And they were very clear that the only computer left is

938
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:32,660
Speaker 1:  the Mac pro. They did that on purpose. They were very clear that they were

939
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:36,410
Speaker 1:  like, we needed to say this. So people like know, like this isn't the

940
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:39,710
Speaker 1:  replacement for the Mac pro this is the Mac studio. We're, they're still

941
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:43,220
Speaker 1:  doing a Mac pro, but we're not, there's no, like <em></em>

942
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:46,700
Speaker 1:  tremendous chip coming here. Like whatever, whatever words they have,

943
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:50,330
Speaker 4:  What's the big differentiator. Is it going to be GPU and having a

944
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:54,140
Speaker 4:  S AMD GPU on it? Will that be the big difference between the

945
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,040
Speaker 4:  two?

946
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,700
Speaker 1:  It'd be fascinating if they'd stick with other people's GPU's I don't know.

947
00:51:58,700 --> 00:51:59,870
Speaker 1:  That'll be it.

948
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:03,050
Speaker 3:  I just have a feeling that the pro is going to come out with an M two, like,

949
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:05,120
Speaker 3:  that's just my gut.

950
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:08,270
Speaker 4:  You don't think it's going to be like seven <em></em> bolted

951
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:09,440
Speaker 4:  together.

952
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,280
Speaker 3:  I suppose they could scale this ultra fusion. They can, so that

953
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,270
Speaker 3:  they're doing two here and they could do four in it, but like then what

954
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:21,020
Speaker 3:  do they call it? Ultra squared.

955
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:24,530
Speaker 3:  Like, I mean, like, they, they, they said that it's not going to be any

956
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:27,910
Speaker 3:  other chips in this M one family. Right? So

957
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:31,460
Speaker 4:  They don't, they don't call the various builds of the <em></em> ultra because

958
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:34,250
Speaker 4:  you can get it there. There's a couple of, couple of different thread counts

959
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:34,610
Speaker 4:  for,

960
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:37,640
Speaker 3:  But those are just like cores being turned on and off on the diet, right?

961
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:41,390
Speaker 3:  Like if they wanted to do two and one ultras fused by ultra

962
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:45,020
Speaker 3:  fusion, that would be like twice the dyed bandwidth or twice the dye

963
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:45,920
Speaker 3:  footprint.

964
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,700
Speaker 1:  I think that might be overthinking it. They might just do a Mac pro and have

965
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,460
Speaker 1:  two I'm on ultra ship center or whatever they could do that if they wanted

966
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,600
Speaker 1:  to. I doubt it. But,

967
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,630
Speaker 3:  But they communicate like that's the magic of this is that the ultra fusion

968
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:59,390
Speaker 3:  is two M one Max's communicating really quickly.

969
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:03,380
Speaker 4:  Like I think in one ultra is just when we start fusing chips together,

970
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:07,310
Speaker 4:  that's our ultra. And like I said, they're not

971
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:11,090
Speaker 4:  going to do this. Is it? This is it. And it would be really weird to

972
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:14,720
Speaker 4:  announce. I mean, I guess it wouldn't be weird if they do the <em></em>

973
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,590
Speaker 4:  the Mac pro as an <em></em> device, but

974
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:21,290
Speaker 4:  that means they have to announce the entire M two

975
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:23,240
Speaker 4:  lineup.

976
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:26,160
Speaker 1:  They don't have to dance the entire, let me see Atlanta. So there are some

977
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,120
Speaker 1:  rumors that they'll do some more stuff at WWDC. We'll

978
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,660
Speaker 1:  see. I would say the thing you get rid of that a Mac pro is

979
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:37,470
Speaker 1:  expansion slots. Yeah. Like that's the thing that, that category of user

980
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:40,980
Speaker 1:  needs, there's all kinds of weird accelerators, stored

981
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,850
Speaker 1:  solutions. They're going to have to figure out some kind of

982
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:45,840
Speaker 1:  expansion slots.

983
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:49,470
Speaker 4:  I got to figure out how to Frankenstein your old eight year old

984
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:51,060
Speaker 4:  Nvidia processor in there.

985
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:54,210
Speaker 1:  I don't know if they think about GPU is expansion, right? I don't think that

986
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:57,660
Speaker 1:  that's the case. I think it is weird accelerators, weird storage

987
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:01,590
Speaker 1:  solutions, weird controllers for specialized provocations

988
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:03,120
Speaker 1:  that need high bandwidth.

989
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,840
Speaker 4:  Well, pro stuff I say actual, because we all think like, I

990
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,990
Speaker 4:  definitely am like, oh, I got to get the pro device. I'm a pro, but I'm not

991
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:12,600
Speaker 4:  a pro I'm not a real,

992
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,180
Speaker 3:  I was looking at buying guides and they say recommended for pros. And I'm

993
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:15,600
Speaker 3:  like, yeah,

994
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:19,590
Speaker 4:  It's a real pro gets excited about those weird accelerators

995
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:23,400
Speaker 4:  on the Mac pro lineup. They're like, yes, I need that. And I do not care.

996
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,000
Speaker 1:  Look, I'm a professional podcaster and a, this 2015 iMac that I'm looking

997
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,510
Speaker 1:  at right now is no longer. It's like, it's all I need. Right. I get it. So

998
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:32,910
Speaker 1:  I just think that that will be the differentiator is they're going to figure

999
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:36,840
Speaker 1:  out that kind of IO, which they've not had any call to

1000
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,830
Speaker 1:  do it. We should talk about the actual computers are one second. It is

1001
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:44,520
Speaker 1:  port city on these, on these machines. It's beautiful. It is

1002
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,980
Speaker 1:  beautiful. I mean, this has USB,

1003
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:50,910
Speaker 3:  This has the rectangles. As Monica put on the site today, it

1004
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:54,120
Speaker 3:  has the rectangles. It's got two USB ports. The back has

1005
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,930
Speaker 3:  four Thunderbolt ports. If you get the ultra there's two

1006
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:01,560
Speaker 3:  Thunderbolt ports on the front. If you get the max chip there's those are

1007
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:05,550
Speaker 3:  USB-C ports. We already mentioned the SD card slot. It's going to HTMI

1008
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:09,360
Speaker 3:  out, which is still HD mic 2.0, not 2.1. This

1009
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,770
Speaker 3:  isn't for gamers, I guess.

1010
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:13,350
Speaker 1:  Yeah. What are you going to do with H 2.1 and the computer that plays no

1011
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:15,120
Speaker 1:  games and doesn't switch.

1012
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:18,360
Speaker 3:  I want to scroll really fast and with 120 Hertz and we

1013
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,260
Speaker 3:  screen,

1014
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:23,190
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I just had fun Jack. Put that out there. It's a headphone Jack.

1015
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:27,110
Speaker 1:  So the two USB ports are fascinating. So the Mac mini has had USB

1016
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:30,870
Speaker 1:  too. Yeah. I think it's half a concession to reality

1017
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:34,110
Speaker 1:  that some people just, especially for a desktop computer, there's lots of

1018
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:37,530
Speaker 1:  USBA floating around. I think we've also heard there's

1019
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:41,160
Speaker 1:  lots of weird pro software that has USB DRM,

1020
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,430
Speaker 1:  dongles, and you just need to plug them in and wasting a Thunderbolt

1021
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:48,330
Speaker 1:  port on like a little authentication key. It's just the saddest thing I've

1022
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:51,300
Speaker 1:  ever heard in my entire life. So you just like stick it in the back, but

1023
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,570
Speaker 1:  I do. But even that is concession to reality, right?

1024
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:58,530
Speaker 1:  Like apple has tried this. I mean, I complained about

1025
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:02,430
Speaker 1:  5g. Like the USBC cycle has

1026
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:06,150
Speaker 1:  been a decade in the making and it has utterly failed to

1027
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:10,080
Speaker 1:  win. And like, the reality is USB is still here. It's

1028
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:13,860
Speaker 1:  still functional, still cheap as hell. And so even on your

1029
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:17,430
Speaker 1:  fanciest new Mac, you're like, here's two USB ports because you might

1030
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:21,270
Speaker 1:  have a ProTools dongle or something else that just needs to

1031
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:25,000
Speaker 1:  off and wasting a for report on that

1032
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,510
Speaker 1:  is, I mean, it's a crime. Like I'll come, I'll come to your

1033
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:29,860
Speaker 1:  house.

1034
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:33,610
Speaker 3:  The last desktop computer that apple introduced, which was the M

1035
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:36,670
Speaker 3:  one iMac had no USB ports. And it was all

1036
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:38,120
Speaker 3:  USB-C,

1037
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:41,890
Speaker 1:  I'd love to hear from our listeners on us. I think Apple's belief is a

1038
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:45,310
Speaker 1:  consumers don't play anything on their computers, which is like half, two

1039
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:49,270
Speaker 1:  and a half. Not right. Like I think they just believe

1040
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:53,050
Speaker 1:  that everything a consumer does on a computer is wireless and that's fine.

1041
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:56,410
Speaker 1:  And that's the way it should be. And then if you have, if you are a

1042
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:59,830
Speaker 1:  pro, you're plugging everything in your computer all the time and there's

1043
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:03,820
Speaker 1:  no middle ground, as far as I can tell that apple thinking, it's

1044
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:07,810
Speaker 1:  like, you get one Porter, you get 9,000. And that's it. I

1045
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:10,480
Speaker 1:  don't know. Like whenever we do these reviews, I hear from people. I was

1046
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,160
Speaker 1:  like, I haven't plugged anything in my computer all the time. And then I

1047
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,680
Speaker 1:  hear from another class of people it's like, thank God the ports are back.

1048
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,720
Speaker 1:  And I'm like, thank God the ports are back. Yeah.

1049
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,960
Speaker 3:  I mean, this is the kind of computer where like, I love these Thunderbolt

1050
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,960
Speaker 3:  docks because they turned my laptop into like a port

1051
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,800
Speaker 3:  monster. Like you could legitimately not need a

1052
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,960
Speaker 3:  doc of any sort with that.

1053
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,660
Speaker 1:  It's kind of computer. If you need a doc for a desktop computer, I will come

1054
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:33,100
Speaker 1:  to your house or

1055
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:36,880
Speaker 4:  You could get four docs and just have

1056
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,620
Speaker 4:  all the ports in

1057
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:42,400
Speaker 3:  Every single port occupied.

1058
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,100
Speaker 1:  It's actually, I don't want to listen to you. I mean like, yeah, we always

1059
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:48,520
Speaker 1:  want to hear from you. If you buy this computer and you buy four Thunderbolt

1060
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,190
Speaker 1:  port box and then fill all those ports, like

1061
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:55,060
Speaker 4:  I want to please send us that picture is incredible. I

1062
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:58,870
Speaker 4:  think my favorite thing about this product though, is that the

1063
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:02,440
Speaker 4:  <em></em> ultra version has a two

1064
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:06,220
Speaker 4:  pound heat sink. There's a two pound difference

1065
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:06,490
Speaker 4:  between

1066
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:09,520
Speaker 3:  The two pounds heavier. Yeah, exactly.

1067
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:13,510
Speaker 4:  It's two pounds heavier than the M one max version because of

1068
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:17,080
Speaker 4:  pounds of hate heat. So that is so like, it's a lot of

1069
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:17,950
Speaker 4:  heat.

1070
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:21,400
Speaker 3:  Oh, it's twice as much as every it's twice a week.

1071
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,700
Speaker 3:  Right? So it only makes sense that you're going to have twice as big of a

1072
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:25,750
Speaker 3:  heat sink.

1073
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:29,530
Speaker 1:  Apple did confirm to us, it is a different heat sink. It's copper. It

1074
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:32,740
Speaker 1:  weighs two pounds more, which is great. I would say the one thing we haven't

1075
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:36,340
Speaker 1:  really talked about is where this thing fits. I think people tend to

1076
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:39,940
Speaker 1:  forget the Mac mini exists. The Mac mini is like a great

1077
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:43,780
Speaker 1:  computer. People love it. This thing is $2,000. There

1078
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:47,470
Speaker 1:  is no more 27 inch iMac. There's just the 24 inch

1079
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:51,430
Speaker 1:  iMac. Yeah. You can still buy an Intel Mac mini, which is wild to me. He

1080
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:52,840
Speaker 4:  Should not be allowed to.

1081
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:56,230
Speaker 3:  It's like the only Intel computer left in the store. Right?

1082
00:58:56,230 --> 00:59:00,040
Speaker 1:  Know the macro and micro course, but I, where the sits is

1083
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:03,160
Speaker 1:  really apple announces your computer tends to, for everything else exists.

1084
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:06,580
Speaker 1:  But this one's really interesting because there's a 24 inch iMac. Then if

1085
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:10,480
Speaker 1:  you want a 27 inch display, they now will sell you

1086
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,930
Speaker 1:  at $1,600 display, which we can talk about, but you have to connect it to

1087
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:17,350
Speaker 1:  a computer. And everyone's like, oh, now the 27 inch iMac has been replaced

1088
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:21,230
Speaker 1:  by a $3,500 setup. And I'm like, no, the, the Mac mini is still

1089
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:24,860
Speaker 1:  there. Yeah. So I think the second year, like want something slightly bigger

1090
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:28,400
Speaker 1:  than 24 inches. They assume you're going to jump to a Mac mini and then a

1091
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,700
Speaker 1:  large display. And if you want more processor, you're going to jump to this

1092
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:35,450
Speaker 1:  thing. But the Mac mini has been so ignored for

1093
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:39,440
Speaker 1:  so long, not by apple, but just like by the world

1094
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,220
Speaker 1:  at large

1095
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:44,090
Speaker 4:  Ignores it too, because when apple did its refresh, it, it didn't, it

1096
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:47,840
Speaker 4:  kept the same casing. Like the <em></em> Mac

1097
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,480
Speaker 4:  mini. It looks the exact same. That was totally why I didn't buy it.

1098
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,870
Speaker 3:  And so to see, I'm want to air the M one air is the same model as the 2018

1099
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:56,420
Speaker 3:  Medicare. They didn't change it. The only change that they made was when

1100
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:59,150
Speaker 3:  they moved to the 14 and 16 inch pros

1101
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:00,620
Speaker 4:  Mini it hadn't been updated for

1102
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:04,310
Speaker 3:  Years in 2018. That's not that old compared to the

1103
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:04,910
Speaker 3:  air.

1104
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:08,900
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I guess that's true. I just felt, it just feels like

1105
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:12,830
Speaker 4:  apple itself ignores the Mac mini. And I think part of it is also, I feel

1106
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:15,980
Speaker 4:  like apple doesn't take advantage. A Mac

1107
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:19,490
Speaker 4:  mini costume was the exact same as an <em></em>

1108
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:22,010
Speaker 4:  MacBook air. Right?

1109
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:25,970
Speaker 3:  It's a few hundred bucks less. It's like six or 700

1110
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:28,430
Speaker 3:  versus a thousand.

1111
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:31,940
Speaker 4:  Like I like, I'm getting a keyboard, I'm getting a

1112
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:35,870
Speaker 4:  monitor. I'm eating so much. When I get a Mac book, air

1113
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:39,680
Speaker 4:  and a Mac mini, I'm like, no, you need to be, you need to be like five, $600

1114
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,370
Speaker 4:  cheaper.

1115
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:43,340
Speaker 3:  You'd know what you get in a Mac mini. You get some ports. Yeah,

1116
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,230
Speaker 4:  I do get support. Yeah,

1117
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:49,090
Speaker 1:  No. I just think that this weird place and apple I'll tell you the Mac studio

1118
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:52,820
Speaker 1:  is a professional machine, but this place between Apple's consumer

1119
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:55,970
Speaker 1:  products and their pro products, there is like a yawning gap. Like I think

1120
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:59,210
Speaker 1:  a lot of people would buy a 27 inch version of the

1121
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:01,640
Speaker 1:  <em></em> iMac. I wouldn't have that computer.

1122
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:05,150
Speaker 3:  I've always been bigger streets. That's like your mantra. They always want

1123
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:05,630
Speaker 3:  a bigger,

1124
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:08,840
Speaker 1:  Cheap, big screens. All anybody wants it. So it's interesting that just sort

1125
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:12,710
Speaker 1:  of like once you're done at 24 apples, like, well, by

1126
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,000
Speaker 1:  one of our desktop computers,

1127
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,840
Speaker 3:  It's telling that when they did the imag M one,

1128
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:21,770
Speaker 3:  they moved from 21 to 24. Like they upgraded like the

1129
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:25,700
Speaker 3:  base IMAX size. And that is kind of telling that like, this is as far

1130
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:29,450
Speaker 3:  as it's going to go, like, this is the size of the iMac now. And if you do

1131
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:33,380
Speaker 3:  want some more screen for whatever reason, then you do have to move into

1132
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:36,320
Speaker 3:  a more professional setup if you're buying from apple.

1133
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:39,560
Speaker 1:  But I don't know if the mini is like a professional setup. Like, that's the

1134
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,090
Speaker 1:  weird thing about

1135
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:44,420
Speaker 3:  If you stick it with the studio display, which we need to talk about, then

1136
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:45,720
Speaker 3:  it becomes a professional setup.

1137
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,950
Speaker 1:  We should take a break and talk about that, but maybe it does, or you just

1138
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:52,850
Speaker 1:  buy whatever garbage monitor you want. Like Vox media,

1139
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:54,470
Speaker 1:  it will fire a garbage Dell

1140
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:58,340
Speaker 1:  monitor. All right. We should

1141
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:00,500
Speaker 1:  take a break and come back and talk about this monitor. I just, that's the

1142
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:04,160
Speaker 1:  thing that like we were talking about with the iPad as

1143
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,520
Speaker 1:  well. If you just kind of look at apples, various segments, there's some

1144
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:11,480
Speaker 1:  weird little corner cases where it's like, I just want to

1145
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:15,380
Speaker 1:  consumer Mac with a big screen. And now the choices

1146
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:16,430
Speaker 1:  you got to put one together,

1147
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:19,800
Speaker 3:  Or maybe you want a iPhone se with a big screen,

1148
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:23,040
Speaker 3:  which you wrote about today, terrible,

1149
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:27,000
Speaker 4:  Terrible opinion. Despite everybody on this call, agreeing with it,

1150
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,380
Speaker 4:  and

1151
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:02,460
Speaker 1:  we're back. One more apple they talking about. Then we got to the lightning

1152
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:06,090
Speaker 1:  round. The studio display is in a class of its

1153
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:09,900
Speaker 1:  own 27 inch 5k studio display 60

1154
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:14,220
Speaker 1:  99. I will say, this is one of the most controversial things that

1155
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:17,400
Speaker 1:  has ever entered the verge. Like we had our like usual after the event

1156
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:21,330
Speaker 1:  call and the fury that erupted on both sides. This

1157
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:23,820
Speaker 1:  is the best thing that's ever happened is the apple should always make as

1158
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:27,350
Speaker 1:  garbage. I hate it. Like we had to like calm him down. There was definitely

1159
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:30,890
Speaker 3:  The only two camps. There was the camp of the

1160
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:34,760
Speaker 3:  PC owners who are maybe more likely to be gamers who are

1161
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:38,240
Speaker 3:  saying, you can get so much more for your money than this. This is

1162
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:42,110
Speaker 3:  awful value proposition. And then there's the camp of like

1163
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:45,470
Speaker 3:  people who have owned the LG 5k and are

1164
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:47,510
Speaker 1:  Like, this is actually great. This is

1165
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:51,470
Speaker 3:  What I wanted for six years and oh, 1600 bucks. I thought it was going to

1166
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:54,440
Speaker 3:  be three grand.

1167
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,740
Speaker 1:  So apple did the pro way XTR it was our first external display and forever

1168
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:01,640
Speaker 1:  was a $5,000 thousand dollars. Standard is incredibly expensive. Some people

1169
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:04,820
Speaker 1:  love it if you love it. That's fine. I think a lot of people have

1170
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:08,180
Speaker 1:  found maybe not all the way up to the

1171
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:09,510
Speaker 1:  hype. There's

1172
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:12,050
Speaker 4:  Probably other ways to spend your $5,000.

1173
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:15,860
Speaker 1:  This is way cheaper, contains a lot of the same display language. The

1174
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:19,120
Speaker 1:  stand comes with it and not a thousand dollars extra, unless you want to

1175
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:22,690
Speaker 1:  adjust the height. In which case you pay $400 more, which is

1176
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:26,230
Speaker 1:  crazy for all we can tell, we have not seen a thing

1177
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:30,220
Speaker 1:  yet. It is the same 27 inch panel

1178
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:33,040
Speaker 1:  from an iMac that we have been looking at forever.

1179
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:36,310
Speaker 3:  It's got a slightly brighter. Yeah. So that it can get that HDR

1180
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:38,830
Speaker 3:  600 rating because it can do

1181
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:42,730
Speaker 1:  600 words. I think that is a quote unquote HDR. We'll see. But

1182
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:46,120
Speaker 1:  typically it's a hundred nits of brightness is what they told us. We, again,

1183
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:49,840
Speaker 1:  we don't know. So we'll see. No mini led.

1184
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,190
Speaker 1:  No, it's a single

1185
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:54,250
Speaker 3:  Backlight backlight. So there's no multiple same

1186
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,920
Speaker 1:  Old tech. You can get an nano Tasha coating. Do we know for

1187
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:00,460
Speaker 4:  Sure it's the same backlight tech and there's not zones.

1188
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:00,970
Speaker 3:  It's a single

1189
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:04,690
Speaker 1:  Zone. If apple was doing backlight zones, like the amount of backlight zone

1190
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:07,870
Speaker 1:  graphics that we would have been exposed to through the risks, love that

1191
01:06:07,870 --> 01:06:08,740
Speaker 4:  Our

1192
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:12,220
Speaker 1:  Announcement can't get enough of backlights zones in, in the, in the

1193
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:15,310
Speaker 1:  spaceship. The thing about it that is just mind blowing to me is that as

1194
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:18,970
Speaker 1:  an eight, 13 chip inside of it, it has a 12 megapixel front

1195
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:22,780
Speaker 1:  camera. That is an iPhone. They just put an iPhone in this thing

1196
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:26,740
Speaker 1:  just to run the camera and the speakers. I love it. It

1197
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:30,730
Speaker 1:  has what, six speakers, four woofers, two tweeters, apple, happily tell

1198
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:33,490
Speaker 1:  you it's the best sound they've ever put on any of their computer

1199
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:37,390
Speaker 1:  products. They claim it does still be Atlas and spatial audio. We will

1200
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:41,110
Speaker 1:  see the whole point of Atmos is like height. You know, it's like, is

1201
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:44,170
Speaker 1:  the, is the monitor going to rise above you? Yeah,

1202
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:48,010
Speaker 3:  You have, you paid $400. You can lift the monitor higher and there's

1203
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:49,870
Speaker 3:  your height.

1204
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:53,500
Speaker 1:  You hear this helicopter versus $400. You got to lift it above your head.

1205
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:57,160
Speaker 1:  But the eight 13 is nuts that it's in there. It does not do

1206
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:01,060
Speaker 1:  iPhone things. It supports center stage and like the

1207
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:04,120
Speaker 1:  bokeh effect, the portrait effect that you can get off. And I'm one

1208
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:07,600
Speaker 1:  Mac my read on it is that if you have

1209
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:11,110
Speaker 1:  an M one Mac modern and one Mac with a

1210
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:14,920
Speaker 1:  webcam, like the Macro-Pro or the iMac or whatever, it's going to

1211
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:18,490
Speaker 1:  look a lot like that. But because the camera slightly better, it's a 12 megapixel

1212
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:22,000
Speaker 1:  camera. It'll be better, but that's it. So like, what is the point of this

1213
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,090
Speaker 1:  eight, 13? It's running the audio, turning the camera, but it's not

1214
01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:28,210
Speaker 1:  doing iPhone tracks. It's not doing night mode. It

1215
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:30,040
Speaker 3:  Was the chip they could

1216
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:33,040
Speaker 1:  Get. I think it's just the chip that could get,

1217
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:36,010
Speaker 3:  We're going to end up with, I like apple watches with eight fifteens

1218
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:39,850
Speaker 3:  because we got all, we can get our hands

1219
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:43,090
Speaker 3:  on. And I mean, like I I'm joking. It's, it's

1220
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:45,520
Speaker 3:  probably the most efficient way for them to

1221
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,480
Speaker 1:  Do it.

1222
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:50,140
Speaker 4:  Sure. I think you're right in that it is, it is probably influenced by the

1223
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:53,140
Speaker 4:  shortage because otherwise they were going to have to, if they want to do,

1224
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:55,270
Speaker 4:  to do center stage, if they wanted to do all of this, they're going to have

1225
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:57,760
Speaker 4:  to put a processor in there. And they're either gonna have a big accustomed

1226
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,570
Speaker 4:  one, which means then they have to go and start that process of

1227
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:05,560
Speaker 4:  getting a custom processor bait. And that's takes a lot that that's a

1228
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:08,680
Speaker 4:  ramp up that takes time. And there's a shortage. Like everybody's going to

1229
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:12,490
Speaker 4:  be like, no, I'm not going to do this for your, like one off small Blake

1230
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:15,950
Speaker 4:  monitor. Everybody's going to say, I could get way more money. What

1231
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:19,610
Speaker 3:  Has the eight 13? Now this occurred apart. I think the base model iPad has

1232
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:23,270
Speaker 3:  occurred has an eight 13 in it that does center stage. It has these

1233
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:25,280
Speaker 3:  features. So it's yeah. Pretty drop it.

1234
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:28,520
Speaker 4:  They're pumping out these eight thirteens already. And I think it just was

1235
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:32,300
Speaker 4:  like super cost efficient for them to be like, yeah, we don't need to make

1236
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:35,390
Speaker 4:  something new. We'll just use this processor because it probably doesn't

1237
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:38,210
Speaker 4:  like the 13th does not cost them a lot of money at this point.

1238
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:40,940
Speaker 1:  Yeah. You know, you could do with an eight, 13 in a giant sway though is

1239
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:44,750
Speaker 1:  make it a touchscreen and just run iPad apps on it. And they, I will

1240
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:47,630
Speaker 1:  tell you, I said this and they're like, no, you can run iPad apps on the

1241
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:51,290
Speaker 1:  Mac already through our wonderful blah, blah, blah. Like they're like, no,

1242
01:08:51,290 --> 01:08:52,280
Speaker 1:  we're not doing that.

1243
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:56,180
Speaker 4:  Are people going to figure out how to run an iPad? Oh, S like on this

1244
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:57,110
Speaker 4:  thing at some point,

1245
01:08:57,110 --> 01:08:58,340
Speaker 3:  Yes. He plug an iPad into

1246
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:01,250
Speaker 3:  it.

1247
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:04,460
Speaker 1:  It's not a touch. It's not a touch screen. So that's like your first

1248
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:05,810
Speaker 1:  problem

1249
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:06,890
Speaker 4:  Now support.

1250
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:10,490
Speaker 1:  Yeah, it's true. But at some point someone's going to try to crack this thing,

1251
01:09:10,490 --> 01:09:14,120
Speaker 1:  right? Like, I hope there's like a huge student display jailbreak community.

1252
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:17,780
Speaker 1:  That would be amazing. But I don't know that this thing is connected to the

1253
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:21,770
Speaker 1:  display controller. Right. I think like, from Apple's

1254
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:25,520
Speaker 1:  perspective, this thing like runs the camera and it runs the

1255
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,960
Speaker 1:  speakers and it runs the micro.

1256
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:29,870
Speaker 4:  So we're looking at like a couple of years before, someone's like, yeah,

1257
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:33,020
Speaker 4:  I'll buy this and crack it open and figure out how

1258
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:35,900
Speaker 1:  No one's seen one yet. So I'm sure someone's going to pull this thing apart

1259
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:39,890
Speaker 1:  right away. But it is wild to me that it's expensive, especially

1260
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:43,040
Speaker 1:  compared to that LG 5k, which everyone has hated forever. It's a good, bad

1261
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:45,860
Speaker 1:  product. And everyone's always been like, why don't you just take the 5k

1262
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:48,890
Speaker 1:  this way out of the iMac and sell to us? Well, they did it. It's just really

1263
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:51,740
Speaker 1:  expensive. And part of the reason it's really expensive is it has most of

1264
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:52,730
Speaker 1:  an iPhone in there.

1265
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:56,540
Speaker 3:  I mean, they also did it like five years later. Like, I feel like if they

1266
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:59,660
Speaker 3:  pulled this out five or six years ago, people would have been like 600 bucks.

1267
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:02,870
Speaker 3:  Okay, cool. You know, this is kind of a new screen. It's like, you're getting

1268
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:06,440
Speaker 3:  the latest technology. Now. It's like six years later and it

1269
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:10,340
Speaker 3:  is, you know, no HDR, no

1270
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:14,210
Speaker 3:  promotion. It is only 27 inches, which I don't know about you, but like

1271
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,960
Speaker 3:  27 inches is pretty small at this point. It just feels dated

1272
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:21,920
Speaker 3:  already. Even though it looks gorgeous, it'll probably function very well.

1273
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:25,400
Speaker 3:  It'll integrate, it's got a whole iPhone jammed in there. It just, that,

1274
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:29,330
Speaker 3:  I think that is a lot of the visceral reaction to the price. But

1275
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:31,640
Speaker 3:  I went into this event thinking they were going to announce a display those

1276
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,400
Speaker 3:  $3,000.

1277
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:37,370
Speaker 4:  I see. I think it's actually that expensive. I mean, yes, it is

1278
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:40,430
Speaker 4:  $1,600. That is a lot of money. But when you're looking at like

1279
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:44,210
Speaker 4:  high-end 27 inch monitor,

1280
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:47,960
Speaker 3:  I'm staring at a 49 inch monitor that runs at 240 Hertz that I paid a

1281
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,640
Speaker 3:  thousand dollars for it.

1282
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:53,450
Speaker 4:  Like I'm looking at a 27 inch monitor that I spent a

1283
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:57,020
Speaker 4:  thousand dollars on. Maybe I just got bamboozled therapy, but I'm

1284
01:10:57,020 --> 01:11:01,010
Speaker 1:  Looking at a 2050 and

1285
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:01,730
Speaker 3:  You already know what

1286
01:11:01,730 --> 01:11:03,430
Speaker 1:  You're doing.

1287
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:07,280
Speaker 4:  I don't think it is for what you're getting in this product. I think,

1288
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:10,580
Speaker 4:  yes, it's expensive, but it's not as expensive as we think, because one,

1289
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:14,550
Speaker 4:  it's got a really nice webcam and nobody else has a really nice

1290
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:18,150
Speaker 4:  integrated webcam. Who's making a really nice integrated webcam and a 27

1291
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:18,990
Speaker 4:  inch monitor.

1292
01:11:18,990 --> 01:11:21,780
Speaker 1:  Well, so this is actually my question, why that they should sell a version

1293
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:25,110
Speaker 1:  without the webcam. If you buy three of these, which some people will do,

1294
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:25,290
Speaker 1:  or

1295
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:25,950
Speaker 4:  You should just sell the

1296
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:29,610
Speaker 1:  Webcam, your zoom situation is going to be bring back the

1297
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:32,490
Speaker 1:  eyesight you coward. Like everyone is going to become like one of those Twitch

1298
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:36,120
Speaker 1:  streamers with multiple angles on a zoom when they buy three. But you only

1299
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:40,020
Speaker 1:  need one way. There's an

1300
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:42,390
Speaker 1:  arguments who made they should definitely sell a cheaper version without

1301
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:43,800
Speaker 1:  the webcam. Yes.

1302
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:47,100
Speaker 4:  I think that would have taken a little bit of the sting out of the price,

1303
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:50,610
Speaker 4:  even though the price is still not $3,000, which Dan and I like, I think

1304
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:52,770
Speaker 4:  before the event, Dan and I were both like, yeah, it's going to be, it's

1305
01:11:52,770 --> 01:11:53,970
Speaker 4:  going to be 3000. I was

1306
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:55,440
Speaker 3:  Like 2,500.

1307
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:59,130
Speaker 1:  I'm excited to look at this thing. I'm going to display ner. I'm very

1308
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:00,750
Speaker 4:  Excited for it.

1309
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:03,720
Speaker 3:  I'll tell you, you are looking at it right now.

1310
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:06,540
Speaker 1:  I'm definitely looking at this thing already right now. I'm sure it looks

1311
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:09,810
Speaker 1:  beautiful in person though. It does. It does work with windows, including

1312
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:12,750
Speaker 1:  the camera, but you don't get any of the camera features because that's software

1313
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:16,620
Speaker 1:  integration. So that's good. It's not the end of the world. It is

1314
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:20,130
Speaker 1:  only Thunderbolt input. It can charge any Mac laptop, which

1315
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:23,850
Speaker 1:  is good. It's actually pretty hard to find 96 watt power

1316
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:27,600
Speaker 1:  supplies for like the top end laptops out of a

1317
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,700
Speaker 3:  Monitor. Yeah.

1318
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:32,460
Speaker 1:  I mean, Apple's just doing what I want at the end of the day, you know, just

1319
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:34,410
Speaker 1:  like give me a couple of ports and I had fun Jack.

1320
01:12:34,410 --> 01:12:37,230
Speaker 3:  Oh, we can not forget. It also has, Hey Siri.

1321
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:40,350
Speaker 3:  Yes. Why? Because it has a whole life on

1322
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:42,180
Speaker 3:  it.

1323
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:45,270
Speaker 1:  Fair enough. Let's still a quick little lighting

1324
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:49,260
Speaker 1:  round, apple updated all of its peripherals to make

1325
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:53,190
Speaker 1:  black versions for the new studio, magic mouse keyboard. Trackpad magical

1326
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:56,370
Speaker 1:  house. We written this story every year for fast five years. We'll keep writing

1327
01:12:56,370 --> 01:12:59,850
Speaker 1:  it still charges on the bottom, which is hilarious. That team, when they

1328
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:01,890
Speaker 1:  were like, make a black one, do you think they're like, I dunno. And they

1329
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:05,670
Speaker 1:  just like rolled the Photoshop dropper over and like announced black carry

1330
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:09,390
Speaker 1:  on apple TV plus is going to do live sports, which is a huge deal. Katie

1331
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:12,810
Speaker 1:  khaki is, is written about this. You know, sports are the stickiest thing

1332
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:14,640
Speaker 1:  for a streaming platforms is shamed. They

1333
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,410
Speaker 3:  Chose baseball though

1334
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:20,340
Speaker 1:  This year. And it's two games on Friday. It's to me free at first

1335
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:22,620
Speaker 1:  it's and yes, it's true that baseball is on the

1336
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:25,080
Speaker 1:  streets.

1337
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:27,170
Speaker 3:  Is there going to be a season this year? Is that

1338
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:30,630
Speaker 1:  Question, you know, I'm, I'm a cynic about apple TV, plus I think they do

1339
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:34,440
Speaker 1:  it mostly to say they have a services product. Like they can try that

1340
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:37,980
Speaker 1:  Reese Witherspoon instead of like a candy crush whale, when they talk about

1341
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:41,850
Speaker 1:  services, revenue, like I think that's important to them, but

1342
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:45,390
Speaker 1:  it's interesting that it's going to sports sound because sports are expensive

1343
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:49,110
Speaker 1:  to get, and they are the thing that makes people sign up

1344
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:50,460
Speaker 1:  for streaming, sir.

1345
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:54,120
Speaker 4:  But baseball also has like how many games, way more games than

1346
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,760
Speaker 4:  football or basketball

1347
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:58,620
Speaker 3:  Games.

1348
01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:01,950
Speaker 4:  And they're only doing Fridays. I don't think we know yet. If they're going

1349
01:14:01,950 --> 01:14:05,530
Speaker 4:  to be blackout dates, if like what kind of games we're going to get,

1350
01:14:05,530 --> 01:14:09,360
Speaker 3:  We have to have a baseball season. So we're putting the cart before the horse.

1351
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:13,330
Speaker 3:  They're they need to actually like have an opening day.

1352
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:16,930
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Other letting your own stuff. They have three meters on a real for

1353
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:19,690
Speaker 1:  cable. It's $160. That's hilarious.

1354
01:14:19,690 --> 01:14:23,170
Speaker 3:  A great price because you can not buy a three meter four cable from anyone

1355
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:25,060
Speaker 3:  else.

1356
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:29,020
Speaker 1:  It's a great, it's like the ultimate monopolist, like a great

1357
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:32,620
Speaker 1:  price. There's all sorts of other stuff we talked about. Google

1358
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:36,460
Speaker 1:  did a big Android feature drop and then their new SVP of

1359
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:40,120
Speaker 1:  tablet stuff, rich miner went on their own

1360
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:43,720
Speaker 1:  Android show and talks about the future of Android tablets is bright.

1361
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:46,620
Speaker 3:  Yep. We'll see that

1362
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:48,600
Speaker 1:  They hired a guy.

1363
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:50,110
Speaker 4:  I mean, maybe he could

1364
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:53,740
Speaker 1:  Do it. Andrew also finally rolled out their iOS friendly emoji

1365
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:57,640
Speaker 1:  reactions and Google messages in case, you know, you have

1366
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:00,670
Speaker 1:  chosen a Google messaging product and it's that

1367
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:04,420
Speaker 1:  one Pixel

1368
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:07,660
Speaker 1:  feature drops are in beta. So you've got pixel. You can do that. We've got

1369
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:10,690
Speaker 1:  a bunch of cool gadget stuff on the site. Yes.

1370
01:15:10,690 --> 01:15:13,300
Speaker 4:  I'm going to plug something here. That is very, very cool. And I'm super

1371
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:17,110
Speaker 4:  excited about that. You could. Now, if you want 3d print

1372
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:20,830
Speaker 4:  and build your own track ball mouse, that's pretty cool. And

1373
01:15:20,830 --> 01:15:23,890
Speaker 4:  we have a great story about it. You guy wet, he's built a

1374
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:27,760
Speaker 4:  bunch. It's called . Yeah.

1375
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,330
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah. I might, as in route, as we speak, I'm going to go buy

1376
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:35,080
Speaker 4:  some, like I'm going to sand it down to get it nice and smooth. I am

1377
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:37,330
Speaker 4:  never been more excited to build track

1378
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:40,300
Speaker 3:  Ball hacks in 2022. Yeah.

1379
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:42,130
Speaker 4:  It's great.

1380
01:15:42,130 --> 01:15:45,400
Speaker 1:  Victoria reviewed the Yves Saint Laurent lipstick printer, which is

1381
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,900
Speaker 1:  actually really cool magic screw

1382
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:51,550
Speaker 1:  that the Steenbeck neurons windows, Shaun officers

1383
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:55,000
Speaker 1:  obsessed with steam deck. Can't get enough of it all day long. I'm like,

1384
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,360
Speaker 1:  what are you working as like steam deck stuff. I'm like, okay, keep, keep

1385
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:02,110
Speaker 1:  bleeding that try. We have a cool hands-on alien, senior monitors. Alienware

1386
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:05,050
Speaker 1:  has a gigantic QD OLED monitor.

1387
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:08,260
Speaker 3:  The, the thing that's significant about this is the first QT Olin screen

1388
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:11,860
Speaker 3:  that's actually shipping. And you can buy a, there was a bunch of qto led

1389
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:15,070
Speaker 3:  stuff announced at CES, including this monitor. Bunch of TVs were announced,

1390
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:18,250
Speaker 3:  but you can't yet buy those. So like, this is the first experience. So people

1391
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:21,190
Speaker 3:  are getting a QD OLED, which is pretty exciting, pretty interesting. And

1392
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:24,850
Speaker 3:  it's also interesting that it's in a gaming monitor, which is usually one

1393
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:28,000
Speaker 3:  of the most demanding places for a new panel tech to go.

1394
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,970
Speaker 1:  I mean, I'm definitely gonna buy this motor then my favorite headline of

1395
01:16:30,970 --> 01:16:34,720
Speaker 1:  the week, because I can't believe this company it's called nothing. So I

1396
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:36,790
Speaker 1:  read this headline. I was like, what are we talking about? Nothing. Can't

1397
01:16:36,790 --> 01:16:39,730
Speaker 1:  stop smart from weeks. And I thought it was like a large piece about the

1398
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:42,970
Speaker 1:  state of smartphone, this company, this credit. Cause I wrote this headline.

1399
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:46,270
Speaker 1:  I was like, what, what does this mean? This company is called nothing is

1400
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:49,960
Speaker 1:  the greatest role in tech history. There's other stuff going on, actually

1401
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:52,870
Speaker 1:  both Peloton and Oculus have now integrated themselves in an apple health,

1402
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:56,650
Speaker 1:  which is like pretty interesting just from a lock-in that's this

1403
01:16:56,650 --> 01:16:59,560
Speaker 1:  weekend lock-in like Paul's on finally gave in, but also I got a new CEO

1404
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:03,250
Speaker 1:  and they started doing stuff they should have been doing forever. Like letting

1405
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:06,370
Speaker 1:  you sync to apple health, they're trialing a program where you get the bike

1406
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:10,220
Speaker 1:  and the software subscription for one fee, like the

1407
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,750
Speaker 1:  new guy showed up and he's like, what are you doing? Just

1408
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:15,260
Speaker 1:  like

1409
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:15,800
Speaker 6:  Grabbing

1410
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:19,670
Speaker 1:  This low hanging fruit. Exactly. But it's fascinating that Oculus

1411
01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:23,510
Speaker 1:  is Mehta is doing with Oculus too. It's fascinating to me that there's

1412
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:26,690
Speaker 1:  rumors of a Facebook watch too. We're all over that. That's it. That's it.

1413
01:17:26,690 --> 01:17:29,030
Speaker 1:  We've done a lot of apple. There's a lot of news on the site. It's been a

1414
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:32,870
Speaker 1:  great week. It's creative maker's week on the site. It's another DIY week.

1415
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:36,650
Speaker 1:  There's a ton of amazing stories about people making stuff, including a guide

1416
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:40,040
Speaker 1:  you'd sense. Tintype photography should read that. And then we have a big

1417
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:43,400
Speaker 1:  feature on trust and son who is a crypto

1418
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,830
Speaker 1:  entrepreneur just keeps getting away with it. And that as most of the best

1419
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:50,300
Speaker 1:  art traction we've ever had on the site. So go read that. That's it we've

1420
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:53,960
Speaker 1:  gone over. No he didn't. No. We went over. You can tweet at

1421
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:57,620
Speaker 1:  us. I'm at reckless Dan's DCC for Alex is Alex H

1422
01:17:57,620 --> 01:18:01,580
Speaker 1:  Kranz Dakota. This week was really fun. It was the CEO of raspberry PI. I've

1423
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:05,330
Speaker 1:  been Upton. And he was like, I'm never doing recurring revenue software.

1424
01:18:05,330 --> 01:18:09,200
Speaker 1:  Like we just make cheap hardware and it beguiles kids and

1425
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:12,980
Speaker 1:  becoming software programmers. Great episode. One of my favorites, that's

1426
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:16,430
Speaker 1:  it we'll be back next week. We're like in the thick of it, like the tech

1427
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:19,670
Speaker 1:  news cycle is like off to the races. So there's, there's more to

1428
01:18:19,670 --> 01:18:23,450
Speaker 1:  come actually. Next week on decoder is the CEO of WordPress. So that'd

1429
01:18:23,450 --> 01:18:26,060
Speaker 1:  be Matt long. That was really good on too. That's it?
