Description: The Verge’s Alex Cranz talks with senior reviewer Monica Chin about the laptops she saw at CES this year and what it means for 2023’s computer trends. Verge reviewer Victoria Song joins the show to discuss the FDA regulations behind health tech, and whether the stuff we saw at CES will ever be available in the United States.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,010
Speaker 2:  Hello, and you're listening to The Verge, the flagship podcast

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,920
Speaker 2:  of laptops with a ton of screens. I'm your friend Alex

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,360
Speaker 2:  Kranz and I am currently walking through the streets of New York to try to

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,280
Speaker 2:  tire out my dog after he slept for the last three days on our drive

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,160
Speaker 2:  back from Texas. Found a whole bunch of cool gadgets in my

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,960
Speaker 2:  mom's house. Really excited to play with them, but first I gotta get this

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,860
Speaker 2:  dog worn out and we gotta do a whole Vercast episode about

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,580
Speaker 2:  ces. I know, I know we've done a ton of episodes about CES so far,

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,160
Speaker 2:  but there's just a little bit more left to do. So we're gonna be talking

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,120
Speaker 2:  to Monica Chin about all the laptop sheets saw and when we're

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,630
Speaker 2:  gonna actually see them in 2023 and what they mean for

13
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,440
Speaker 2:  laptop trends this year. And then we're gonna talk to Victoria's Song because

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,000
Speaker 2:  health technology was a really big deal at the show this year. And she's

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,560
Speaker 2:  been looking into what the FDA is doing to make sure that when we use all

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,440
Speaker 2:  these new health gadgets, we don't die. But first I gotta

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,480
Speaker 2:  go wear this dog out. I'll see you right after the

18
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,420
Speaker 2:  break.

Speaker 2:  Okay, and we're back. So there was a ton

24
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,510
Speaker 2:  of laptops announced at ces. I know we've talked about a bunch of 'em on

25
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,390
Speaker 2:  the show already, but I had to talk to Monica Chen because

26
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,070
Speaker 2:  she was actually there. She got to play with these laptops

27
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:10,870
Speaker 2:  and she wrote about almost every single one announced at the show it

28
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:14,670
Speaker 2:  seems like. So we're gonna talk about the Lenovos and the Razors and the

29
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,910
Speaker 2:  lgs and the suss, all of them. And then we're gonna talk about the state

30
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,700
Speaker 2:  of the laptop business in 2023 and what you're gonna see from all of these

31
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,470
Speaker 2:  companies this year. It's a super fun conversation. Very

32
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,390
Speaker 2:  nerdy. Let's get

33
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,490
Speaker 2:  into

34
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,170
Speaker 2:  it. All right, Monica, have you recovered

35
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,550
Speaker 2:  from CES yet? Did you get a funk?

36
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,650
Speaker 5:  A funk?

37
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,080
Speaker 2:  Yeah. The CES funk. Are you like snotty right

38
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,830
Speaker 2:  now?

39
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,670
Speaker 5:  No, actually I was, I was so sure I was gonna come back like deathly ill,

40
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,950
Speaker 5:  but I'm like very fine right now. I'm raring to go, which I think might be

41
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,590
Speaker 5:  the first time that has ever happened to me after CS where I haven't come

42
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,490
Speaker 5:  back with like the flu. So knocking on wood, you never know what could

43
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,710
Speaker 5:  happen. But this was a remarkably good recovery.

44
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,300
Speaker 2:  Awesome. Well that is great because I'm just gonna be like grilling you

45
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,940
Speaker 2:  today about ces. I'm very jealous that I didn't get to go, I didn't get to

46
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,780
Speaker 2:  go to like that weird room that Lenovo always has. It's not weird.

47
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:09,950
Speaker 2:  It's

48
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,860
Speaker 5:  Fine. We missed you in that room Alex.

49
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,900
Speaker 2:  I know they, they were probably like, where was she?

50
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,140
Speaker 5:  There were laptops with your name on them everywhere and you weren't there.

51
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,340
Speaker 5:  It's

52
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,060
Speaker 2:  So sad. It was I'm oh my god, you're, you're giving me a lot of FOMO

53
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,460
Speaker 2:  right now, but you saw a bunch of stuff. I know there was the really, really

54
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,220
Speaker 2:  kick ass Lenovo that I'm glad I didn't go cuz I would've been just playing

55
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,990
Speaker 2:  without the entire time. What, like what was your favorite thing that you

56
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,140
Speaker 2:  saw at CES this year?

57
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,100
Speaker 5:  I would have to say the, the Lenovo dual screen. Basically what it is is

58
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,780
Speaker 5:  there's a 13.3 inch olet screen on the top. There's a 13 inch olet screen

59
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,660
Speaker 5:  on the bottom, 2.8 K, same size, same resolution. You can fold

60
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,900
Speaker 5:  it in half, you can unfold it. So when you unfold it, it's just like this

61
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,980
Speaker 5:  super tall thing and then you like put it on a kickstand and it's just like

62
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,220
Speaker 5:  this one massive long window with like a hinge in the middle but whatever.

63
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,100
Speaker 5:  And then you can fold it into a clamshell laptop mode where you have

64
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,500
Speaker 5:  like one screen on the top and one screen on the bottom you can put sideways.

65
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,420
Speaker 5:  So it's like a book. You can fold it backwards so that it's a tablet and,

66
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,260
Speaker 5:  but like the keyboard's not awkwardly on the back. There are a lot of ways

67
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,780
Speaker 5:  you can use it. It it, it's like a surface new reimagined kind of like this

68
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,940
Speaker 5:  sort of form factor isn't new. Yeah. But it feels a little more similar to

69
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,900
Speaker 5:  me to using like a foldable, like Lenovo's done a

70
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,650
Speaker 5:  foldable before. Asus has a foldable, various people have

71
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,980
Speaker 5:  foldables. This is like that. But like if it didn't suck because

72
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,940
Speaker 5:  like foldables are like a lot of fun to fold but like they're

73
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,740
Speaker 5:  fun to use as a tablet when you fold them into a clamshell

74
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,620
Speaker 5:  form factor. The problem is that like cuts the screen size you have in

75
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,380
Speaker 5:  half. Yeah And like makes it like really impractical to use often. Like even

76
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,580
Speaker 5:  the 17 inches when you fold 'em they still become like pretty small. Andre

77
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,260
Speaker 5:  pretty cramped because of like the bezel space on the side. Because

78
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,780
Speaker 2:  You're talking about the foldables that are like one big display,

79
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,660
Speaker 5:  Like the Zen book fold. Yeah, the thing pad X one fold. Yeah, this is like

80
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,580
Speaker 5:  that except when you fold it, it actually you can actually still use it and

81
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,380
Speaker 5:  it's just like a regular 13 inch. Oh. Which I really, I

82
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,260
Speaker 5:  really like and I think this is actually like really versatile and practical.

83
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,660
Speaker 2:  I know you only got to spend a little time with it. You didn't get to spend

84
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,740
Speaker 2:  days and days with it. But how was the typing?

85
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,980
Speaker 5:  So there is a keyboard, there's like a keyboard that you can like snap on

86
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,540
Speaker 5:  and off. That is what I would use most of the time just cuz like that's a

87
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,460
Speaker 5:  keyboard. I wanna type on a keyboard most of the time You can also type in

88
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,300
Speaker 5:  it, plug in an external keyboard, which is what I assume some folks will

89
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,710
Speaker 5:  do if they don't like the flat one. I liked the flat one. I thought it was

90
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,660
Speaker 5:  fine. It did not feel like super super flat. I would not say it was,

91
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,380
Speaker 5:  I mean it doesn't feel like using like a great keyboard for me suits or someone.

92
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,500
Speaker 5:  But like I thought it was like acceptable. I would've been happy to like

93
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,820
Speaker 5:  type on it. It had a nice click. You can also use

94
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,740
Speaker 5:  a haptic feedback keyboard on the flat screen on the bottom if you

95
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,180
Speaker 5:  fold it into clamshell mode.

96
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,660
Speaker 2:  But is it good?

97
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,460
Speaker 5:  So obviously I think most people aren't gonna prefer to like type on

98
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,320
Speaker 5:  a flat screen cuz like it's typing on a flat screen. I much prefer it to

99
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,080
Speaker 5:  typing on like an iPad. The haptic feedback is like very good. There's like

100
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,640
Speaker 5:  a real click. The keys are really roomy because it is full size, like it

101
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,520
Speaker 5:  is the size of that. It would be on a 13 inch laptop. So it wasn't like

102
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,400
Speaker 5:  riddled with typos the way that like it often is what I'm typing on an iPad

103
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,160
Speaker 5:  cuz it's so tiny. Yeah. And so it was like usable. It was probably the

104
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,960
Speaker 5:  best on-screen keyboard I've ever tested. Which again, the bar for that is

105
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,800
Speaker 5:  on the floor. But it is, it is like, it is not difficult to meet that

106
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,040
Speaker 5:  standard at all. But it is like a, it is a nice haptic keyboard that like

107
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,920
Speaker 5:  you could use it in a pinch. You, you feel like you are clicking keys a little

108
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,360
Speaker 5:  bit, which again is more than for example, you get from the

109
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,120
Speaker 5:  windows on-screen keyboard most of the time. I

110
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,760
Speaker 2:  Like, I'm honestly not surprised by that cause Lenovo's always been pretty

111
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,520
Speaker 2:  good at keyboards. More so on the think pad than the, than the yoga lines.

112
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,960
Speaker 2:  But like I've always liked a Lenovo keyboard.

113
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,840
Speaker 5:  Yeah, think pad keyboards are very, are legendary. Unfortunately

114
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,520
Speaker 5:  this one not being a think pad does not have a have a haptic little

115
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,360
Speaker 5:  red thing in the middle.

116
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:55,940
Speaker 2:  That would've been the

117
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,560
Speaker 5:  Best. But you know you can't have everything in life. But it is really fun.

118
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,280
Speaker 5:  And the other cool thing when you've about clamshell mode is when you use

119
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,000
Speaker 5:  that, that onscreen keyboard, regardless of whether you are using the

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,950
Speaker 5:  haptic one or the physical one that you like plunk on, there

121
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,680
Speaker 5:  is a touch pad that they put like on the bottom. Cuz like one of my

122
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,000
Speaker 5:  big concerns when I first saw this announcement, I was like where is the

123
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,960
Speaker 5:  touchpad? There's no touchpad on this. Like how do you navigate this? And

124
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,320
Speaker 5:  the answer is that there are a number of different ways, but one of them

125
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,920
Speaker 5:  is there is a haptic touchpad that they put on the bottom. It's

126
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,840
Speaker 5:  the buttons are actually like physical buttons. I mean they're

127
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,240
Speaker 5:  like virtual physical buttons. Like they're not like real buttons but like

128
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,090
Speaker 5:  they, they are outlined as buttons when you click they feel like you're clicking

129
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,480
Speaker 5:  buttons. Oh again, it doesn't feel like you're clicking like great buttons.

130
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,360
Speaker 5:  But it is like I, I would say it is better haptic feedback than like

131
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,070
Speaker 5:  some other haptic touch pads out there.

132
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:51,040
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I deeply enjoy Lenovo products. Think pads are like if I

133
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,920
Speaker 2:  had to own a Windows pc that wasn't it when I built myself it'd probably

134
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,720
Speaker 2:  be a think pad but the bloatware can be kind of bad

135
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,560
Speaker 2:  in Lenovo products did this feel like bloated at all?

136
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,760
Speaker 2:  Like all, all this extra software because this isn't Windows stuff. This

137
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,490
Speaker 2:  is like Lenovo made all of this stuff to make it

138
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:08,840
Speaker 2:  work.

139
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,810
Speaker 5:  So there is one, as far as I know, there's one Lenovo

140
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,560
Speaker 5:  like control center where you sort of control everything and other than that

141
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,200
Speaker 5:  it really is just, it at least in my, what I was doing it was

142
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,680
Speaker 5:  Windows with like a bunch of extra gestures that they put in. So there were

143
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,910
Speaker 5:  not like, as far as I know, it was not like an Acer experience where there's

144
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:30,880
Speaker 5:  like Lenovo Experience Center and Lenovo Game Center and Lenovo

145
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,080
Speaker 5:  Sound Center. Like I do, I, there might be those but I didn't have to interact

146
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,880
Speaker 5:  with them if they were there. I didn't have things popping up everywhere.

147
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,800
Speaker 5:  Again, this was a pre-production unit so that is somewhat difficult to extrapolate

148
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,880
Speaker 5:  to like what's gonna be on the shelf and like what you're gonna get if you

149
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,520
Speaker 5:  buy one of these. But this really felt very much like

150
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,960
Speaker 5:  using Windows and

151
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,880
Speaker 2:  They actually plan to ship

152
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,100
Speaker 5:  It. Yeah, this is, they were putting this out is their claim like it's not

153
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,560
Speaker 5:  Windows 10 x or it's not like the the fancy Microsoft thing thing that they

154
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,000
Speaker 5:  were gonna ship. Like this is regular Windows. It feels like using Windows.

155
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,360
Speaker 5:  Lenovo has put a bunch of gestures in and the Lenovo control center, which

156
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,160
Speaker 5:  is where you can like play with the haptic touch pad and you can toggle

157
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,840
Speaker 5:  with the keyboard and fool around with some of the, the dual screen stuff

158
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,800
Speaker 5:  that actually seemed pretty responsive. It didn't, again, I only had a little

159
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,040
Speaker 5:  bit of time with it and it was supervised. But sometimes those things are

160
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,160
Speaker 5:  like super glitchy when they first ship and like required to restart the

161
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,040
Speaker 5:  computer when you like do a single thing. This seemed pretty responsive and

162
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,680
Speaker 5:  pretty like well developed and like time was put into it and reasonably well

163
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,040
Speaker 5:  laid out like the part I think you're gonna access the most, which is the

164
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,280
Speaker 5:  please pull up the touch pad part was like really easy to get to and not

165
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,680
Speaker 5:  buried. So that was great.

166
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,800
Speaker 2:  That's very cool. And it comes out what time of this year?

167
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,690
Speaker 5:  It's supposed to arrive in June. Okay. And they gave me $2,000

168
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,360
Speaker 5:  price. So like somewhere in that range we're expecting that's

169
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,640
Speaker 2:  A similar pri what did they talk about processor at all? Like what's the

170
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,650
Speaker 2:  internals on this thing look

171
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:51,510
Speaker 5:  Like? So yeah it has the 13th gen, intel core I

172
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,230
Speaker 5:  seven U 15 processor. So that's a u serious

173
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,950
Speaker 5:  processor. It's a thin and light processor. It's not gonna be like, you know,

174
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,600
Speaker 5:  your huge gaming laptop stuff. But I have had, I have had a lot of people

175
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,640
Speaker 5:  ask and even some of our video people asked like, could you edit on this?

176
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,600
Speaker 5:  And like I think you could try like I wouldn't, you know, and I think this

177
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,680
Speaker 5:  will be obvious, most people who work in the space but a youer processor

178
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,600
Speaker 5:  isn't gonna give you like the best premier pro experience. But I have had

179
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,920
Speaker 5:  U series machines where I've had to dive into Premiere and like do some quick

180
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,640
Speaker 5:  things or I've had to go do some photo stuff and like it's slow, it's kind

181
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,340
Speaker 5:  of slow to load but like will work And that's like again without

182
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,280
Speaker 5:  making any like strict pronouncements, not having used the thing for it.

183
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,720
Speaker 5:  That's what I would like generally expect out of this kind of

184
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,800
Speaker 5:  category processor. Yeah,

185
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,320
Speaker 2:  No I'm just excited cuz I feel like we've been seeing this

186
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,120
Speaker 2:  form factor. How many times have you gone, I know I've done it a bunch. And

187
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,670
Speaker 2:  you have too. You go to a place and they get really excited and they're

188
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,600
Speaker 2:  like, okay, you can't, you can't share this with anyone. It's not ready

189
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,400
Speaker 2:  yet. It's like three years away. But look and it's, it's, it's

190
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,280
Speaker 2:  what Lenovo's doing right now.

191
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,270
Speaker 5:  Yeah. They've had prototypes of this thing at their CES

192
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,800
Speaker 5:  booth before in various years and

193
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,920
Speaker 2:  Other people have too, right? Like I feel like Intel was always showing Intel's

194
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,720
Speaker 2:  always like the new way Intel's so good that soon this

195
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,840
Speaker 2:  is gonna be your computer.

196
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,360
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean I think what that highlights is like, this is not like a new

197
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,600
Speaker 5:  form factor. Like that's like people have done this before, this has been

198
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,160
Speaker 5:  floating around. I see this really as a software announcement.

199
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,000
Speaker 2:  Oh, interesting.

200
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,960
Speaker 5:  Lenovo has said that they've invested in putting real

201
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,880
Speaker 5:  gesture control on this thing. They've ingested in an ecosystem

202
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,840
Speaker 5:  where this is easy to use. They have put in the work

203
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,360
Speaker 5:  to make, to address the question of where is the touch pad

204
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,200
Speaker 5:  for example. And like the fact that everyone hates onscreen

205
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,400
Speaker 5:  keyboards and doesn't, and virtual touch pads are kind of hit or miss when

206
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,880
Speaker 5:  other companies try them. They really, I think have put thought into that

207
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,880
Speaker 5:  stuff and effort into that stuff. How it's gonna pay off. You know, we're

208
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,720
Speaker 5:  gonna have to see. But that to me is the, the significant thing here.

209
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,160
Speaker 5:  Less so the, the fact that you can like open and close it and there's a screen

210
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,480
Speaker 5:  on the bottom, although that is cool.

211
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,280
Speaker 2:  It is cool. And it's also just $2,000. I say just that is a

212
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,120
Speaker 2:  lot of money for something that is not actually tested with lots of people

213
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,080
Speaker 2:  using it yet. But that feels kind of cheap to me.

214
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,880
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I mean that 2000 is, is more than a lot of people are gonna wanna pay

215
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,720
Speaker 5:  compared to Foldables. That's a bargain. Like the ASU Zen book 17 fold started

216
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,410
Speaker 5:  at like over 4,000 I think like it was like some ridiculous amount of

217
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,600
Speaker 5:  money. So this is like, not that it is, you know, it's still a premium product.

218
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,560
Speaker 5:  In the premium space. We, we hope to see that drop Lenovo prices often

219
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,480
Speaker 5:  do drop very quickly. Lenovo often sets their, their

220
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,000
Speaker 5:  MSPs like much higher than things tend to sell for. So I'm hopeful that we'll

221
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,970
Speaker 5:  see it, we'll see it go for lower.

222
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,330
Speaker 2:  Did at any point you flip it around and pretend like you were in Star

223
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,550
Speaker 2:  Trek?

224
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,040
Speaker 5:  No,

225
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,040
Speaker 2:  Just shut me down.

226
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,200
Speaker 5:  I haven't seen Star Trek so I don't know what you're talking about unfortunately.

227
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,240
Speaker 2:  All right. We're not gonna take a break yet, but that made me wanna take

228
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,800
Speaker 2:  a break real bad. I'll survive, I'll survive. What other cool stuff did

229
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,040
Speaker 2:  you see at ces?

230
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,000
Speaker 5:  So also in the Lenovo booth, one of the things I thought was really cool

231
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,680
Speaker 5:  was they had the Lenovo think phone by Motorola. And this

232
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,410
Speaker 5:  is essentially if a think pad like made a

233
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:14,200
Speaker 5:  wish on a star to become a smartphone, then that wish came true. Like it's

234
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,160
Speaker 5:  this little smartphone that like is designed to look like a ThinkPad. It

235
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,080
Speaker 5:  has like if you've used a ThinkPad you'll and you see this phone, you'll,

236
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,280
Speaker 5:  you'll sort of get what I'm talking about. Like it has the textured back

237
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,520
Speaker 5:  that it's all black, it has like the little logo with the red dot on it.

238
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,480
Speaker 5:  There is a little red button on the side, which is not a keyboard N but

239
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,040
Speaker 5:  like that's probably the best you can do on a literal smartphone is like

240
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,640
Speaker 5:  a little red button on the side. You can remap it, which if you're a ThinkPad

241
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,400
Speaker 5:  user you may have experience remapping some of their

242
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,310
Speaker 5:  keyboard keys. I certainly do. So it's, it's made

243
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:50,200
Speaker 5:  to sort of seamlessly interact with the ThinkPad in some similar ways that

244
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,920
Speaker 5:  the iPhone interacts with like Mac computers. So there's

245
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,680
Speaker 5:  like one of the most obvious sort of glaring examples there is the, they

246
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,490
Speaker 5:  have a similar feature to continuity camera where it can use a think

247
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:05,080
Speaker 5:  phone as like your webcam when you're video conferencing on a think pad.

248
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,800
Speaker 5:  And that's like super easy to set up. I got to try that. There's a number

249
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,400
Speaker 5:  of other connectivity features. There's one called the, I think it's the

250
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,120
Speaker 5:  United Clipboard where you can like take a photo with

251
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,640
Speaker 5:  your phone and then like press Ctrl V on the think pad and it

252
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,920
Speaker 5:  like automatically paste that photo like right into whatever's open on the

253
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,760
Speaker 5:  think pad. So

254
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,410
Speaker 2:  Kind of like what you can do with an iPhone and a

255
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:26,760
Speaker 2:  Mac.

256
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,440
Speaker 5:  So sort of, yeah and there's, there's a lot of other sharing like find each

257
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,640
Speaker 5:  other really easily over wifi. There's like tethering stuff happening. It

258
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,960
Speaker 5:  was a lot of fun to use and I think it's like, like if I had a think pad,

259
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,200
Speaker 5:  I think it would be like a really, I think it would make my life easier in

260
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,960
Speaker 5:  a lot of ways. So that that was a lot of fun to try.

261
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,080
Speaker 2:  Who is the audience though? Like

262
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,810
Speaker 5:  Think pad lovers, like think pads are like one of the most beloved

263
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,120
Speaker 5:  lines of all time. I mean

264
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,080
Speaker 2:  I know they're beloved but like are there enough people out there who are

265
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,960
Speaker 2:  like, I'm going to get rid of my iPhone or like

266
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,640
Speaker 2:  my fancy Samsung

267
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,550
Speaker 2:  foldable or whatever and be like I'm going to fully embrace

268
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:04,840
Speaker 2:  ThinkPad.

269
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,240
Speaker 5:  I mean I think the audience is fairly specific in that like it's, it's

270
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,080
Speaker 5:  really for hardcore ThinkPad people who like

271
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,920
Speaker 5:  only use Think pads and really want something that will compliment

272
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,600
Speaker 5:  their ThinkPad use. I think that like those people definitely exist though.

273
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,240
Speaker 5:  And I think I, it'll certainly be interesting to see how many people actually

274
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,390
Speaker 5:  buy this. I mean it's been like how many years in the making since, since

275
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:29,810
Speaker 5:  Lenovo, Lenovo bought Motorola. So I, I'm not the phone

276
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:33,720
Speaker 5:  reviewer so I, I didn't spend a ton of time testing like

277
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,680
Speaker 5:  the Dustproof ratings or any, any of that like phone stuff. That wasn't

278
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,640
Speaker 5:  what I was there to do. But I did from the laptop side get a chance to see

279
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,520
Speaker 5:  like how well it interacted with the Think pad and it was pretty well. Awesome,

280
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,760
Speaker 2:  Awesome. Allison's just furious right now. She's like, you didn't take any

281
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,560
Speaker 2:  notes on this? Yeah.

282
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,280
Speaker 5:  Yeah it was funny when I was, I was sort talking to Allison about it and

283
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,400
Speaker 5:  she was like, oh yeah it has this, this is such a cool phone, it has like

284
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,070
Speaker 5:  this like military grade durability feature and like this number

285
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,960
Speaker 5:  of, this number of years under warranty. And I was like, oh cool. I just

286
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,880
Speaker 5:  like that you could like take a photo with it past it out with ThinkPad.

287
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,760
Speaker 5:  I thought that was cool

288
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,600
Speaker 2:  Alice, she's like, well she'll be very excited. She's gonna have so much

289
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,360
Speaker 2:  fun reviewing it. We're gonna learn all about Allison's Secret love of Think

290
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,720
Speaker 2:  Pads. It's gonna be great. You're gonna have to be like looking over her

291
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,000
Speaker 2:  shoulder. It's gonna be wonderful. Yeah,

292
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,680
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I'm be like hey do that, do that.

293
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,560
Speaker 2:  You saw a bunch of stuff at the Lenovo booth. What other brands were doing

294
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,480
Speaker 2:  interesting stuff?

295
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,060
Speaker 5:  So Razor has its biggest blade ever. The Razor Blade

296
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,910
Speaker 5:  18. The Razor Blade 16 has a, it's a big boy. The

297
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,840
Speaker 5:  mini l e d display on the razor blade 16 is really cool. These

298
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,560
Speaker 5:  both just look like razor blades. I mean they all, they all same. They're

299
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,520
Speaker 5:  razor blades so

300
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,720
Speaker 2:  Still like just absorbing your fingerprints.

301
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,520
Speaker 5:  Yep. Absorb fingerprints, RGB keyboards. They got the

302
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,800
Speaker 5:  little razor logo on the back that everyone knows and loves.

303
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,530
Speaker 5:  Blade 16 has a mini l e d display, which looks really

304
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:59,080
Speaker 5:  cool. We sort of were in like a dimly lit hotel room, which is where they

305
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,040
Speaker 5:  had all this stuff laid out. They had their razor edge, which is like their

306
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,520
Speaker 5:  gaming handheld. This wasn't announced here but this was the first time that

307
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,080
Speaker 5:  that I got hands on time with it. Yeah, it's an Android tablet with like

308
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,960
Speaker 5:  little controllers attached to it. It runs stuff from like, I

309
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,440
Speaker 5:  was like what services does it have? It they, they gave me like 20 services,

310
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,240
Speaker 5:  like GForce S now is on there and Steam Xbox Steam

311
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,160
Speaker 5:  links on there. Like all yeah all that stuff is on there. And

312
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,440
Speaker 5:  they were playing some different games with it. It's, it's fun they're, it's

313
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,400
Speaker 5:  gonna come like with 5G and Cellular connectivity and without

314
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,080
Speaker 5:  it. So like if that's something you're interested in, you wanna just be out

315
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,520
Speaker 5:  doing Android tablet stuff with it and you wanna pay more, that's an option

316
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,320
Speaker 5:  for you.

317
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,520
Speaker 2:  So I have a question for you about this. I remember, I think Cameron wrote

318
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,750
Speaker 2:  about it for the site. He is a, he's a giant cloud gaming

319
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,640
Speaker 2:  nerd. He's probably softly weeping that Stadia is dead but

320
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,510
Speaker 2:  not as much as Tom Warren. There's a lot of bere people here about

321
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,000
Speaker 2:  Stadia.

322
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,840
Speaker 5:  Yeah, for sure.

323
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,520
Speaker 2:  But it kind of reminded me, it mainly to me it looked more like they have

324
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,720
Speaker 2:  these little controllers that you can attach to your phone. The, the Kishi

325
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,210
Speaker 2:  I think is how you say it.

326
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,720
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it looks a little like that

327
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,400
Speaker 2:  And it felt kind of like that. But you're buying a

328
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,150
Speaker 2:  tablet from Razor to stick in it instead of just your

329
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:13,640
Speaker 2:  phone.

330
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,120
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I mean their pitch for this, I sort of asked them, I was like, so like

331
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,840
Speaker 5:  is this just an Android tablet controllers and their pitch is like no because

332
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,680
Speaker 5:  of the, the high refresh rate screen Okay is like much higher than you'll

333
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,240
Speaker 5:  get on like most like Android tablets. It's like specifically for gaming

334
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,900
Speaker 5:  it looks very smooth and because of the the extra

335
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,350
Speaker 5:  like all the gaming services that are like come natively on

336
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:39,080
Speaker 5:  it. Okay. So those are like the two main different things that you're

337
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,520
Speaker 5:  paying for. But like at minimum it is like an Android tablet. Like you could

338
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,280
Speaker 5:  just buy this and like use it as a very expensive high refresh rate Android

339
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,780
Speaker 5:  tablet with controllers if you wanted to like that option would be open to

340
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,200
Speaker 5:  you.

341
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,990
Speaker 2:  And they have this mini l e d laptop. I know we've seen like

342
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:57,040
Speaker 2:  apples I think has done some mini l e D laptops. Is this the first we're

343
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,490
Speaker 2:  seeing from like a Windows maker?

344
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:03,360
Speaker 5:  No. So it's sort of been a trend that has like slowly and gradually

345
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,120
Speaker 5:  been picking up speed over the past couple of years. This is a big year for

346
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,640
Speaker 5:  it. Okay. We had a number of mini l e d displays

347
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,480
Speaker 5:  come out and this one had like, I think they said a

348
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,440
Speaker 5:  thousand local dimming zones, which is higher than we heard from other

349
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,360
Speaker 5:  laptops. Yeah and it looks, it looks very cool. These will not be cheap laptops

350
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,080
Speaker 5:  but razor blades are not cheap but it's cool to look at. And they had a little

351
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,960
Speaker 5:  demo like on the side where they were showing they had a little panel that

352
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,790
Speaker 5:  had all the local dimming zones like arranged in a grid and it would

353
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,760
Speaker 5:  like show each little dimming zone lighting up when the

354
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,040
Speaker 5:  dimming zone on the blade was lighting up or dim. Yeah, concurrently. So

355
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,680
Speaker 5:  that was really cool to just see like how tiny these things actually are,

356
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,670
Speaker 5:  how many of them there are and like how hard they're working basically like

357
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:48,440
Speaker 5:  while this device is displaying an image, this

358
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,280
Speaker 2:  Is technology we've seen from TV makers for years

359
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,880
Speaker 2:  now. Like they've been doing this a very long time and it's taken a super

360
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,800
Speaker 2:  long time it feels like to laptops to catch up. I mean you saw, you

361
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,360
Speaker 2:  said you saw a lot of 'em this year. Is this gonna be kind of one of those

362
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,200
Speaker 2:  things they're hoping we'll drive upgrade cycles and they're, they're hoping

363
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,640
Speaker 2:  people will see that display and be like, yeah, that's my reason to go get

364
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,160
Speaker 2:  a new laptop I just bought one two years ago.

365
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,930
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I suspect so. I mean I think display was definitely a

366
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:19,800
Speaker 5:  focus of many gaming manufacturers this year. You know in the

367
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,520
Speaker 5:  past couple years it's really been like you could get an OED or you can get

368
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,280
Speaker 5:  a higher refresh rate screen but like you couldn't get both or you could

369
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,040
Speaker 5:  get Q H D or you could get like two 40 hertz but you couldn't get

370
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,840
Speaker 5:  both of them And you're starting to see those converge a little

371
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,760
Speaker 5:  more so that it's the expect, it's not as much the expectation that you'll

372
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,600
Speaker 5:  have to give up like a ton of premium features in order to get one. Okay.

373
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,040
Speaker 5:  So we saw a lot, for example, we saw a number

374
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,840
Speaker 5:  of glasses, free 3D displays and one of the

375
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,520
Speaker 5:  big pitches for those is like you don't have to give up other stuff to get

376
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,480
Speaker 5:  this glasses free 3d. It's also od it's also high refresh rate.

377
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,200
Speaker 5:  So like you can still game on it. We're seeing high refresh rate od we're

378
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,000
Speaker 5:  seeing high refresh rate Q H D, that's definitely a

379
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,560
Speaker 5:  space wear like the arms race is picking up.

380
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,120
Speaker 2:  Do you think we're gonna see a moment where laptop makers

381
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,800
Speaker 2:  stop shipping laptops with absolute garbage displays? I

382
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,720
Speaker 2:  mean they're always gonna do that in the sub thousand dollars category, right?

383
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,680
Speaker 2:  Like they're never gonna put a good display in something like that.

384
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,920
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I was gonna say but

385
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,200
Speaker 2:  In those more expensive ones, do you think we're gonna see a moment where

386
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,080
Speaker 2:  they just like, you know what, we're done with garbage displays,

387
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,960
Speaker 2:  we're going all in on L led, we're going all in on micro l e d and from

388
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,920
Speaker 2:  now on if you wanna Dell X PS 13, it's gonna be a

389
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,480
Speaker 2:  really kick ass display. You're not gonna have to like look at your wallet

390
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,440
Speaker 2:  and decide what's worth it.

391
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,170
Speaker 5:  What I do think is we will definitely see this stuff start to

392
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:47,120
Speaker 5:  come to lower price devices. Whether that will

393
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,880
Speaker 5:  completely eliminate the need to have like 1920 by 1200

394
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,440
Speaker 5:  on lower price devices. I, I don't entirely know, but I do think that

395
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,080
Speaker 5:  like while this stuff is in the premium space right now, it will, I would

396
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,930
Speaker 5:  expect that like in the next couple years, like getting a two 40 or

397
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:05,720
Speaker 5:  it's QD display, like we'll get significantly less expensive. Then often

398
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,080
Speaker 5:  when you see this kind of like fancy

399
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,840
Speaker 5:  stuff debut on fancy laptops, that is an

400
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,440
Speaker 5:  important announcement. Not just because it's going to be on those fancy

401
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,320
Speaker 5:  laptops, but because it, that sort of starts the clock for when we're gonna

402
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,080
Speaker 5:  see it on stuff in the sub 1000 range because that is where most people are

403
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,120
Speaker 5:  shopping. Like stuff like the G 14 stuff like the Asian like that is better

404
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,040
Speaker 5:  selling stuff than like the fanciest ACE or Predator Triton

405
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,080
Speaker 5:  and heli is,

406
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,960
Speaker 2:  I feel like laptops are in this unique space where you have

407
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,240
Speaker 2:  a whole bunch of different model types, right? Like a TV

408
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,080
Speaker 2:  ma manufacturer is gonna be like, okay, you get your 55 or your

409
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,800
Speaker 2:  65 or your 75, that's it. Laptop makers are like, okay, you can get your

410
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,610
Speaker 2:  13 inch now, would you like it with an 1980 by

411
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:52,480
Speaker 2:  1200 or 1980 by 10 80? You

412
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,880
Speaker 2:  know, like they're, they're asking for, they just ask you for tons of different

413
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,800
Speaker 2:  things to choose and you're inevitably like that laptop that's advertised

414
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,000
Speaker 2:  for a thousand dollars and seems like a great deal, the one that actually

415
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,740
Speaker 2:  makes sense is $3,000 and now you have no

416
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:10,000
Speaker 2:  money. I'm just curious if we're gonna see it at condensing in the, in at

417
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,280
Speaker 2:  least in the monitors element of laptops

418
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,800
Speaker 2:  as these OLEDs and many LEDs become more popular.

419
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,360
Speaker 5:  Yeah, like I think gamers like in general, what, what I hear

420
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,960
Speaker 5:  from companies that they like to have choice and that part of the reason

421
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,720
Speaker 5:  that many of these models are like, so like that they're like

422
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,720
Speaker 5:  a dizzying number of models compared to like the four options that there

423
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,680
Speaker 5:  are for the XPS 13 or whatever Is that like just gamers are really, really

424
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,400
Speaker 5:  picky about, about the kind of stuff that they want. So I wouldn't necessarily

425
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,240
Speaker 5:  think that we'll see models condensing, but like if the question of like

426
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,210
Speaker 5:  whether we'll see displays get better and

427
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,600
Speaker 6:  Better in the sub 1000 space, I think is like absolutely true. So

428
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,600
Speaker 2:  We're seeing, we're seeing the trickle down we're it's it's happening. All

429
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,640
Speaker 2:  right, well we're, we're gonna take a break and when we come back we're gonna

430
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,440
Speaker 2:  talk about why this is all happening because you have been writing a

431
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,400
Speaker 2:  bunch about how the laptop space is in a, in a difficult spot

432
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,800
Speaker 2:  right at the moment. So we're gonna take a break and we'll be

433
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:19,810
Speaker 2:  right

434
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,900
Speaker 7:  Dating apps. Whether you're single in a relationship or summer in

435
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,680
Speaker 7:  between, you can't get away from them, but what happens when your romantic

436
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,600
Speaker 7:  life is part of a company's bottom line? How did dating become

437
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,220
Speaker 7:  a multi-billion dollar business? I'm Lakshmi

438
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:57,640

00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,400
Speaker 8:  And I'm San Toy Kurtz. We are hosting Land of the Giants,

442
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,280
Speaker 7:  search for love.

443
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,520
Speaker 9:  Even though you think you're going to meet someone, you know, you have some

444
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,080
Speaker 9:  endpoint narratively in mind, but actually

445
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,820
Speaker 9:  these companies, they don't really want it to have a

446
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,240
Speaker 9:  resolution.

447
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,400
Speaker 7:  And what happens when we hand our hearts over to corporations,

448
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,840
Speaker 10:  It's all about snap judgment and biases and I'm like, you don't even know

449
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,640
Speaker 10:  me. And maybe if you just like swiped right and messaged me and we talked

450
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,480
Speaker 10:  a little bit and you gave me a an effing chance, you wouldn't

451
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,200
Speaker 10:  reject me cuz I'm awesome or am I not awesome.

Speaker 2:  And we're back, Monica, you wrote this great piece that

457
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:59,790
Speaker 2:  should be up by the time people are listening to this episode, we're

458
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:03,130
Speaker 2:  editing it right now and having a great time. That's all

459
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:06,950
Speaker 2:  about how laptops are in kind of a bad place at the moment.

460
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:10,550
Speaker 2:  People aren't buying 'em, nobody wants to buy 'em and the

461
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:13,910
Speaker 2:  technology, the hardware maybe isn't always keeping up. So laptops are starting

462
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:16,020
Speaker 2:  to pivot. Is that right?

463
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,790
Speaker 5:  So I wouldn't, I don't know if I would call it a pivot, but one of the

464
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:23,670
Speaker 5:  big things that that sort of hung over this year's CES

465
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:27,470
Speaker 5:  going into it was the fact that the PC market is like way,

466
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,670
Speaker 5:  way down. You know, 2020 and 2021 were

467
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:34,120
Speaker 5:  like huge, huge years for the PC

468
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,510
Speaker 5:  and there's been a lot of decline year over year

469
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,590
Speaker 5:  throughout 2022

470
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,630
Speaker 2:  Because everybody bought their laptops.

471
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:44,270
Speaker 5:  Every manufacturer besides Apple had declining sales

472
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:47,710
Speaker 5:  and laptops in particular saw a lot of decline. And there's a lot of, you

473
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:51,510
Speaker 5:  know, there's stuff about refresh cycles and there's the

474
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,190
Speaker 5:  fact that Apple is like eating everyone's lunch in like the portable laptop

475
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:55,710
Speaker 5:  space and

476
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,610
Speaker 2:  In the processor

477
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,950
Speaker 5:  Space and in the processor space in for, for the thin and light

478
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:03,510
Speaker 5:  in particular. So one of the big questions going into the show was

479
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:07,430
Speaker 5:  like how are, how are manufacturers going to deal

480
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:10,030
Speaker 5:  with this? Not only like how are they actually gonna deal with it, but how

481
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:13,390
Speaker 5:  are they going to try to convince me that it's not a problem? And like what

482
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:16,070
Speaker 5:  angle are they going to take? When I asked them

483
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,110
Speaker 2:  Did they convince you?

484
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:21,070
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So there are a couple different tacts that companies took in

485
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:24,910
Speaker 5:  general. You know, they, the, the task they have is to like, you know,

486
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:28,630
Speaker 5:  they have to get people to bot to keep buying laptops even if they may

487
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:31,670
Speaker 5:  have laptops that they bought in 2020 that still work

488
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:35,510
Speaker 5:  pretty well and how do they keep the market exciting

489
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:39,430
Speaker 5:  so that people will be like, oh I need that even though this MacBook Air

490
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:43,250
Speaker 5:  works fine. And so there are some directions that involve

491
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:47,190
Speaker 5:  like how cool the laptop looks and like Lenovo is like kind of an example

492
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:50,870
Speaker 5:  of that with like the fancy dual screen. There are companies like

493
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:54,670
Speaker 5:  LG that released like really like beautiful color changing

494
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:55,350
Speaker 5:  laptops. Wait

495
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,190
Speaker 2:  What part of 'em is changing colors?

496
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,790
Speaker 5:  So the LG gram style,

497
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:00,670
Speaker 2:  What a name

498
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:04,150
Speaker 5:  Is covered in an irid. It's stylish, it's covered

499
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:07,990
Speaker 5:  in iridescent finish finish. So like when you hold it up to the light

500
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:11,310
Speaker 5:  it can look like silver or purple or like

501
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:14,870
Speaker 5:  orange sometimes depending on like the angle and like where the

502
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:18,630
Speaker 5:  sun is. It's very, so like there's like cool stuff like that that some companies

503
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:22,430
Speaker 5:  are trying to do that's like eye popping and just sort of like is something

504
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:26,390
Speaker 5:  that could jump out at you if you were shopping around. Yeah. Another attack

505
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:30,220
Speaker 5:  that some companies are taking is like going hard

506
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:33,840
Speaker 5:  on services, on like AI stuff and on

507
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,710
Speaker 5:  features. So when I spoke to Alex Cho, HP's

508
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,520
Speaker 5:  president of personal systems who is great, his pitch was really hard on

509
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,440
Speaker 5:  like we're not a PC manufacturer, like don't think of us as just PCs.

510
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,130
Speaker 5:  We're building an ecosystem and like we oh okay, this year our big

511
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:52,880
Speaker 5:  pitches is like services and HP has like

512
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,500
Speaker 5:  their booth that they, their their sort of showcase that they had here in

513
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,360
Speaker 5:  New York before ces, the big front and center thing was like

514
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,320
Speaker 5:  webcam features. And so they had, there's like a dual webcam thing

515
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,520
Speaker 5:  that some of their laptops support now where you can have like two webcams

516
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,760
Speaker 5:  plugged into one laptop and it'll like switch between the feeds depending

517
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,470
Speaker 5:  on like where you're looking cause it's tracking your eyes.

518
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:13,960
Speaker 2:  Fancy.

519
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,790
Speaker 5:  They had, yeah they have like this present, this new present software

520
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:21,520
Speaker 5:  that a bunch of stuff is built on that is tracks where your head is

521
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,480
Speaker 5:  and tracks where your eyes are. They have just a lot of different

522
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,880
Speaker 5:  webcam stuff and that's sort of something you're seeing across the line like

523
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,680
Speaker 5:  razor I mentioned earlier, they have this like soundbar that tracks like

524
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,600
Speaker 5:  where your head is and based on that it like adjusts like what the audio

525
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,880
Speaker 5:  sounds like to make it still sound like it's moving with

526
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,640
Speaker 5:  you. Essentially there's, as I mentioned earlier, there's like 3D

527
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,480
Speaker 5:  displays that rely on knowing where you're looking to be

528
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,280
Speaker 5:  able to show you the two different images in order to create the 3d.

529
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,670
Speaker 5:  So you know, HP has this new like concierge

530
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:57,320
Speaker 5:  service that provides like 24 7 live

531
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,280
Speaker 5:  support. There's a lot of emphasis on cloud gaming this year. I

532
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:05,080
Speaker 5:  mentioned razor's new like cloud gaming handheld, HP

533
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,040
Speaker 5:  has like integrated GForce now with its

534
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,520
Speaker 5:  HP omen software client thing.

535
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,760
Speaker 2:  Yeah, there was the, and there was all that work we talked about in the first

536
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,360
Speaker 2:  segment about Lenovo and, and the stuff they were doing with the phone and

537
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,240
Speaker 2:  the stuff they were doing to make this this dual screen laptop work. So yeah,

538
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,150
Speaker 2:  but these companies aren't known for their software.

539
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:29,650
Speaker 2:  Like anyone who's used an HP

540
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:33,160
Speaker 2:  printer is familiar with HP's software.

541
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,800
Speaker 2:  Anybody who's first opened an HP laptop

542
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,480
Speaker 2:  knows that software, why should I be inspired

543
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,010
Speaker 2:  or like want to more regularly engage with them. Especially

544
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:47,400
Speaker 2:  when Samsung, who's actually pretty good at software and

545
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,360
Speaker 2:  Apple who's made it their deal for a long time now, also kind

546
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,600
Speaker 2:  of struggle with services sometimes.

547
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,080
Speaker 5:  So on the commercial side, they're really pushing

548
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,680
Speaker 5:  it for like the hybrid worker and

549
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:04,600
Speaker 5:  the freelancer. Oh and that's the pitch they have for their

550
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,240
Speaker 5:  concierge service, which I don't entirely buy, but their claim is like, you

551
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,960
Speaker 5:  know, if you're a, if you're someone who like is running your own business

552
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,760
Speaker 5:  from your laptop and you just don't have an IT department,

553
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,000
Speaker 5:  but you really wanna be able to quickly access service, you can press this

554
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,680
Speaker 5:  button and pull up an HP concierge to service your laptop.

555
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,080
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I'm not convinced that that's the target audience as much as like

556
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,880
Speaker 5:  my parents

557
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,280
Speaker 2:  Like

558
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,160
Speaker 5:  Might like buy this laptop and like have no idea why it like won't turn

559
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,080
Speaker 5:  on or something. But the, the pitch they're making is that

560
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,960
Speaker 5:  it's more for like people who, who are a small business or who don't have

561
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,880
Speaker 5:  a huge IT department and want like their Zoom calls to

562
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,760
Speaker 5:  look really professional and wanna have access to all these cool features

563
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,000
Speaker 5:  but like don't have a company doing it for them. Again, I don't know, when

564
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,900
Speaker 5:  I look at this stuff, I sort of, the question I always ask is like, is

565
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:58,840
Speaker 5:  this new fancy thing addressing a need that is

566
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,440
Speaker 5:  actually there or is it creating a need that I am not

567
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,120
Speaker 5:  sure people actually have right now? What I think is addressing a need that's

568
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,560
Speaker 5:  already there is the Lenovo dual screen. Like I think there are like a ton

569
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,040
Speaker 5:  of times in my life when I'm like doing some work and I'm like, wow, I'd

570
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,480
Speaker 5:  really love to have like a second screen here right now. Yeah. I'm not sure

571
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,440
Speaker 5:  if all this like present sensing, fancy webcam,

572
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,360
Speaker 5:  fancy sound, 3D screen stuff is quite, I I am more on

573
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,120
Speaker 5:  the fence about that kind of stuff.

574
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,360
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I think like that makes sense. If you're a recruiter and you wanna

575
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,200
Speaker 2:  look just like tip top for all of your remote interviews

576
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,360
Speaker 2:  that you're doing throughout the day, it makes less sense if you're just

577
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,240
Speaker 2:  like using your laptop for and

578
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,160
Speaker 2:  sending emails to vendors, which is assu I assume what small

579
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,920
Speaker 2:  businesses do and

580
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,550
Speaker 5:  Freelancers just email. Yeah.

581
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:52,480
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Well you also, I I know you saw a lot of processors stuff

582
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,240
Speaker 2:  at the show and you, you did like that scathing takedown of the Intel

583
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,080
Speaker 2:  P series last year, which was tiptop you loved it

584
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,780
Speaker 2:  absolutely wild that they were like, what if we just made a processor

585
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:07,560
Speaker 2:  that was the exact same as our super fast processor Yeah. But kind

586
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:11,360
Speaker 2:  of tweaked it to go a little slower and use a little less energy and

587
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,040
Speaker 2:  that sucked.

588
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,720
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But

589
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,480
Speaker 2:  Were things a little more exciting this year. Do, do you feel like AMD and

590
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,400
Speaker 2:  the, and Intel and these companies are finally gonna be catching up to

591
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,230
Speaker 2:  Apple in that laptop space cuz Apple's just kicking everybody's

592
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:24,720
Speaker 2:  ass.

593
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,270
Speaker 5:  It's really hard to know from the, the charts we have right now, they definitely

594
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:31,390
Speaker 5:  both made a splash. A M D released this

595
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:34,800
Speaker 5:  like absolutely massive 16

596
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,520
Speaker 5:  core chip intel released a 24 core chip, but that

597
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,080
Speaker 5:  is like eight performance cores and 16 efficiency

598
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,410
Speaker 5:  cores. Whereas the a MD chip is like 16 like

599
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:49,360
Speaker 5:  full firings and four cores. So I think that's, that staggered up

600
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,960
Speaker 5:  to be very competitive. These are, but like I remember I

601
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,910
Speaker 5:  saw and Tom and Sean, I, and we were like looking at these like a m

602
00:34:56,910 --> 00:35:00,430
Speaker 5:  d like the chart that a MD sent us that had all the chips and we were just

603
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:03,920
Speaker 5:  like, what, how is AMD putting that in a laptop like that

604
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,640
Speaker 5:  is wild. There definitely is exciting stuff coming outta these

605
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,720
Speaker 5:  processor announcements. Will these be laptops that have like any kind of

606
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,480
Speaker 5:  battery life at all? Is really the question. We're gonna have to wait and

607
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,380
Speaker 5:  see will this last longer than 30 minutes on battery? We really don't

608
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:20,960
Speaker 5:  know. The target audience for these chips doesn't necessarily

609
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,920
Speaker 5:  care about having laptops that last eight hours, but that doesn't mean

610
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,680
Speaker 5:  that they'll be happy necessarily with the battery that only lasts like

611
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,080
Speaker 5:  five minutes. Who,

612
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,040
Speaker 2:  Who, who is okay? Who is okay? Who is the person buying a laptop that

613
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,630
Speaker 2:  is okay with having five minutes of battery

614
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:40,360
Speaker 5:  Life? Yeah, so I will say whenever I write a review like,

615
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,880
Speaker 5:  and, and I say like, I don't like that this didn't last long, very long on

616
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,480
Speaker 5:  battery for me without fail, there are people in the comment saying, well

617
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,280
Speaker 5:  I don't care about battery life, all my laptops. So yeah, your review's

618
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,920
Speaker 5:  wrong. There are certainly, there are certainly groups of people who don't

619
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,760
Speaker 5:  need very long battery life on their laptops. However, I

620
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,510
Speaker 5:  do think that like there is some amount of battery

621
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:04,160
Speaker 5:  power a laptop should have in order to justify its existence as like

622
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,000
Speaker 5:  a laptop rather than like a mini, a pc, like

623
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,120
Speaker 5:  a desktop,

624
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,270
Speaker 2:  A PC that you can just pick up and go with.

625
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:14,160
Speaker 5:  Right. Part of the appeal is that you could like move it around her house

626
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,080
Speaker 5:  or potentially like use it at a friend's house or

627
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,600
Speaker 5:  like, you know, that you don't necessarily need to be plugged in Alan all

628
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,240
Speaker 5:  the time. So that is like a big question mark that we'll have to see. But

629
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,010
Speaker 5:  of course it's not the most important thing about these chips.

630
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:32,800
Speaker 2:  Okay. So, so they seemed really focused not on battery life

631
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,450
Speaker 2:  where Apple is just crushing them but more on

632
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:37,040
Speaker 2:  power.

633
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,880
Speaker 5:  Oh, definitely. And they had, I mean they very much hedged that, like when

634
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,720
Speaker 5:  I was talking to Jason Banta from a m d, he very

635
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,710
Speaker 5:  much hedged like, these are not gonna have good battery life.

636
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:51,720
Speaker 5:  Basically. Like he was like, you know, our tar we're we're really targeting

637
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,200
Speaker 5:  an audience that doesn't care about battery life as much as they care about,

638
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,040
Speaker 5:  you know, X and Y and Z. Which, you know, is a fair audience to target.

639
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,360
Speaker 2:  Are they planning to ever target audiences that

640
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,160
Speaker 5:  Like battery life? Well not with this particular, the 16 court chip. I mean

641
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,400
Speaker 5:  the obvi their, their other chips I think are,

642
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,110
Speaker 2:  But this is where they were announcing their high

643
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:14,540
Speaker 2:  power laptop chip. So like the H series for

644
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,980
Speaker 2:  Intel and I don't know, what is the series called

645
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,920
Speaker 2:  for amd?

646
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,800
Speaker 5:  So there, the 70 45 series is Zen four. Okay.

647
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,770
Speaker 5:  That goes up to 16 cores and 30 huge threads. There's the seven 40

648
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:30,680
Speaker 5:  series. Oh wow. Is gonna be, that's the Phoenix that's gonna be for like

649
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,560
Speaker 5:  thinner gaming laptops. Okay. There's the 7 35

650
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,400
Speaker 5:  series, which is Rembrandt r that's

651
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,680
Speaker 5:  for like the premium what thin and light space.

652
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,480
Speaker 2:  Monica, what are these names?

653
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,440
Speaker 5:  These names make no sense. There's the Rise 70 30 series, which

654
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,280
Speaker 5:  is for mainstream, thin and light. Is

655
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,640
Speaker 2:  It called a Picasso?

656
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,320
Speaker 5:  No, that's called the Barcelo R. What

657
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,400
Speaker 2:  Does that mean?

658
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,200
Speaker 5:  I have no idea. And that goes up to eight. The, that goes up

659
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,680
Speaker 5:  to eight core 16 threads as do the previous two that I mentioned. And then

660
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,800
Speaker 5:  there's the rise in seven 20, which is like your alon. So that's gonna be

661
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,640
Speaker 5:  for like very low power budget devices and that goes up to four cores.

662
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,320
Speaker 5:  So there's a whole, there's a whole range of stuff on here.

663
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,800
Speaker 2:  Well I'm very excited for your one minute long battery test for all these

664
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,160
Speaker 2:  HX series. It's gonna be a lot of fun. Was there anything else that, like

665
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,040
Speaker 2:  you saw at ces, any kind of trends that you feel are coming for the

666
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,760
Speaker 2:  laptop space? What do we need to brace ourselves for this year?

667
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,720
Speaker 5:  For, for brands we didn't get to, like I said, LG has the style, which is

668
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,590
Speaker 5:  that really cool color changing one. It has the ultra slim, which

669
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:37,480
Speaker 5:  is, I think it's, its like thinnest and lightest LG gram

670
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,400
Speaker 5:  ever. It's either the thinnest or the light, but it is so light. Like you

671
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,800
Speaker 5:  pick that up and it's like, it, it feels like you're holding like a

672
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,200
Speaker 5:  dummy chassis. It's like absurdly light. I have no idea who's gonna like,

673
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,170
Speaker 5:  want that, but it like it's, it's re that thing is

674
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:54,800
Speaker 5:  remarkable. HP has a new, it's called the Dragonfly

675
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,320
Speaker 5:  Pro Chromebook. It has an RGB keyboard because you know,

676
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,760
Speaker 5:  why not put that on a Chromebook that's not for gaming. Yeah.

677
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,610
Speaker 2:  I think ne Eli's planning to get that for his

678
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:07,720
Speaker 5:  Parents. Go for it. Nea I'm the Godspeed, I'm very happy

679
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,680
Speaker 5:  for you. They have the Dragonfly Pro, which is not the

680
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,320
Speaker 5:  elite dragonfly that remains, that also had a refresh. There's

681
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,160
Speaker 5:  the Dragonfly G4 now. But that is for businesses, that's a

682
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:23,130
Speaker 5:  business laptop. The Dragonfly Pro, despite having pro its name is for

683
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:27,080
Speaker 5:  consumers. So you know, very simple name that makes sense to everyone. But

684
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:30,760
Speaker 5:  that is sort of a push from them to target who I mentioned

685
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,720
Speaker 5:  earlier, like the freelancer or like the mobile professional,

686
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,160
Speaker 2:  The contractors,

687
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,600
Speaker 5:  Right. The contract. Yeah. In terms of trends, this is definitely gonna be

688
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,080
Speaker 5:  a big display year, especially on the gaming side.

689
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,720
Speaker 5:  We're seeing like a lot of convergence of, you

690
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,420
Speaker 5:  know, buzzwords like O led and mini l e d and refresh

691
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:54,040
Speaker 5:  rate and resolution. And, and I can't believe I'm saying this

692
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,720
Speaker 5:  in 2022 or 2023 3D

693
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,280
Speaker 5:  glasses, free 3D is a thing now that is coming to some laptops.

694
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,920
Speaker 2:  I refuse to be excited about it. I refuse to be excited about 3d.

695
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,760
Speaker 5:  Acer had one last year, but it's like, like updated it this year. Dell

696
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,720
Speaker 5:  has like a 3D thing. We're seeing all that sort of come together and,

697
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,390
Speaker 5:  and that we're able to get more of those features on

698
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:19,480
Speaker 5:  displays than where previously you had to sacrifice some of

699
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,320
Speaker 5:  them togethers. So displays are definitely getting better. I think there,

700
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,690
Speaker 5:  there was a big focus on video conferencing this year as there was last year.

701
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:30,480
Speaker 5:  And AI and role in that was a huge part of it. A m D and

702
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,360
Speaker 5:  Intel both are planning to have AI architecture on the

703
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:38,280
Speaker 5:  dyes of some of their processors, which is at

704
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,000
Speaker 5:  the moment the most relevant application of that to

705
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,640
Speaker 5:  like most people is gonna be stuff like Windows studio effects. And AMD

706
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,480
Speaker 5:  had Panos pane on stage to talk about that. But it's gonna be

707
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,320
Speaker 5:  like more webcam, present sensing stuff for now.

708
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:57,280
Speaker 5:  And then the pitches that later on we're gonna see people come up with more

709
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,920
Speaker 5:  heavy duty AI use cases for that stuff. But that's,

710
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,120
Speaker 5:  that's really other big thing. And there's definitely, as there has been

711
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,650
Speaker 5:  for the past few years, a focus on like

712
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:11,030
Speaker 5:  how laptops will respond to

713
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:14,600
Speaker 5:  changing work patterns. So like last year I think there was a lot

714
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,560
Speaker 5:  of focus on work from home and remote work. I think this

715
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,520
Speaker 5:  year it's shifted a little more towards hybrid and people who like want

716
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:26,240
Speaker 5:  a laptop that they can use both in the office and at home.

717
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,400
Speaker 2:  Isn't that just every laptop?

718
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,520
Speaker 5:  Some companies are trying to pitch it more as like, here you only need one

719
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,080
Speaker 5:  cord to plug this into this monitor. Oh. Where before it was

720
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,240
Speaker 5:  more complicated.

721
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,160
Speaker 2:  They're embracing the doc again.

722
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,320
Speaker 5:  It's that and it's a lot more of a focus on, you know, and there's always

723
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,280
Speaker 5:  kind of a focus on like laptops getting thinner. But this year I think a

724
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,490
Speaker 5:  lot of it's really being pitched as like, this is thin so that you can bring

725
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:51,200
Speaker 5:  it to the office or like, so that you can bring it to Starbucks

726
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,680
Speaker 5:  and focus on the mobile professional or

727
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,840
Speaker 5:  mobile freelancer.

728
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,240
Speaker 2:  Do you think, so one of the best laptops ever made was

729
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,040
Speaker 2:  the Apple Power book, Pismo

730
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,000
Speaker 2:  G three. This thing came out on like, yeah, you sound

731
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,920
Speaker 2:  so enthusiastic and excited about this question. This thing came out in

732
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,480
Speaker 2:  like 19 98, 19 99, I think, please

733
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:13,600
Speaker 5:  Tell

734
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,130
Speaker 2:  Me more. It had a dock and all you and all of the ports were on the

735
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:20,760
Speaker 2:  back. So whenever you wanted to plug in, you just went th and you

736
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,380
Speaker 2:  just shoved it into the dock and it looked pretty and it worked so

737
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:28,360
Speaker 2:  nice. And every dock since has been like it's a dongle and you

738
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,200
Speaker 2:  plug it in. Do you think we're gonna get back to that point where you're

739
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,940
Speaker 2:  like thump because I, the

740
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,960
Speaker 2:  satisfaction was wonderful.

741
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,050
Speaker 5:  There definitely is a focus I think on making

742
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:43,960
Speaker 5:  monitors simpler to use, which is great for me cuz the current monitor

743
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,840
Speaker 5:  I have like, I have to plug like four computers into it a week and like yeah

744
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,720
Speaker 5:  it is difficult right now to figure out how to, how to plug 'em all in. So

745
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,560
Speaker 5:  that is definitely, I think a trend you'll see more in in peripherals

746
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:59,360
Speaker 5:  this year is is simplifying their moving them between

747
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,440
Speaker 5:  use cases and making those more versatile to connect.

748
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,240
Speaker 2:  So we're not quite to thunk yet, but we may be.

749
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,640
Speaker 5:  I'm not sure if we're to that yet.

750
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:11,400
Speaker 2:  Well Monica, thank you so much. This has been a wonderful conversation. We're

751
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:15,240
Speaker 2:  gonna take a break when we're back. I'm gonna be talking with Victoria

752
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,840
Speaker 2:  song all about all the health stuff that came outta

753
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,440
Speaker 2:  ces, what's going on with the FDA there and how long it'll take for this

754
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,560
Speaker 2:  health stuff to actually get into our homes. It's gonna be great. Thanks

755
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,630
Speaker 2:  again Monica. Thank

756
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:27,120
Speaker 5:  You.

757
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:27,320
Speaker 2:  Down to

758
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:42,740
Speaker 2:  the

759
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,390
Speaker 2:  break.

760
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:47,370
Speaker 12:  Hi, I'm John Glenn Hill and I'm the new host of The Weeds,

761
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:51,290
Speaker 12:  a podcast from Vox all about politics and policy. Our

762
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:54,600
Speaker 12:  mission is to take deep dives into policies shaping our

763
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:58,290
Speaker 12:  world. Everything from crypto regulation to immigration

764
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:01,530
Speaker 12:  to climate change. And this week for

765
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:05,290
Speaker 12:  my first official episode in the host chair, we're firing up

766
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:08,130
Speaker 12:  the weeds time machine. And taking a trip back

767
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:10,500
Speaker 12:  to 1965

768
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,980
Speaker 13:  Today is a triumph for freedom. As

769
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,890
Speaker 13:  huge as any victory that's ever been won on

770
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:19,290
Speaker 13:  any battlefield.

771
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:22,780
Speaker 12:  To talk about one of the most significant pieces of civil rights legislation

772
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:26,570
Speaker 12:  in US history, the Voting Rights Act and with

773
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:29,570
Speaker 12:  questions swirling around election integrity and the future of

774
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:33,400
Speaker 12:  American democracy, we figured there's no time like the present to

775
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:37,240
Speaker 12:  look back on it, subscribe to the weeds for new

776
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:37,640
Speaker 12:  episodes

777
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:44,900
Speaker 12:  every

778
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:45,390
Speaker 12:  Tuesday.

779
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:48,630
Speaker 2:  Okay, and we're back. Ns, I teased at the beginning of the show, there was

780
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:52,470
Speaker 2:  a lot of health tech at CES this year. There were the

781
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:56,310
Speaker 2:  smart watches and the makeup tools and the P sensors

782
00:44:56,310 --> 00:45:00,270
Speaker 2:  and a ton of hearing aids. A lot of this stuff is very

783
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:04,030
Speaker 2:  cool, it's super exciting, but it almost never reaches the

784
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:07,660
Speaker 2:  United States mostly because of FDA regulations around medical

785
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:11,350
Speaker 2:  technology. It's a tricky issue. So I wanted to talk to our Reviewer

786
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:14,830
Speaker 2:  Victoria song who just wrote a really fantastic piece explaining

787
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:18,430
Speaker 2:  this regulatory maze behind all that Health

788
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:21,750
Speaker 2:  Tech Victoria, are you recovered from your c s funk that you

789
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:24,550
Speaker 2:  got without actually being at ces?

790
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:28,530
Speaker 14:  That's how powerful CES is. I got the c s flu without going and

791
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:31,910
Speaker 14:  like, you know, I'm still a little sniffly and I don't know if my voice

792
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:35,080
Speaker 14:  is a hundred percent back to normal, but I don't sound like Marge Simpson

793
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,230
Speaker 14:  anymore. So good stuff.

794
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:39,390
Speaker 2:  Level up. Level up. I mean that would've been great. We would've been like,

795
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:43,070
Speaker 2:  we have Marge Simpson on the verge cast today. Tell us about

796
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:45,350
Speaker 2:  health tech

797
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:49,040
Speaker 14:  Would've been nice. Yeah, I mean it was cool. It was, it was

798
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,950
Speaker 14:  interesting at c s this year because a lot of it is very,

799
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:56,590
Speaker 14:  it's, it's kind of a mix between what's conceptual and what's

800
00:45:56,590 --> 00:46:00,360
Speaker 14:  actually real and everything that's in the gray area in

801
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,990
Speaker 14:  between. So you know, like that's always ces, right? There's always a degree

802
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:06,670
Speaker 14:  of vaporware at CES where you're like

803
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:07,630
Speaker 2:  A lot of vaporware,

804
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:11,390
Speaker 14:  A lot of vaporware. But particularly in the health sector where you're

805
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:15,310
Speaker 14:  just like, wow, this concept is going to

806
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:18,910
Speaker 14:  change the medical industry as we know it. Five years later the product

807
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:22,390
Speaker 14:  comes out and it's Nerf. Yeah and it's not no nowhere near as cool as what

808
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:26,350
Speaker 14:  they, what they said it was gonna be. And I think the coolest,

809
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:30,070
Speaker 14:  I don't know about coolest, but the most interesting thing I saw this

810
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:32,510
Speaker 14:  year was why things you scan, that

811
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:34,150
Speaker 2:  Was the P sensor. Yes.

812
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:38,110
Speaker 14:  It is a little sensor that you stick in your toilet

813
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:41,310
Speaker 14:  and to peon. Yeah. And it's got all these, it's all, it's got all these

814
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:45,070
Speaker 14:  things in it. Like a thermal sensor and a radar sensor so it

815
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:49,030
Speaker 14:  can like identify your individual urine stream,

816
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:52,870
Speaker 14:  which is just like, wow, what amazing technology for your,

817
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:54,110
Speaker 14:  for your toilet

818
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:57,750
Speaker 2:  Use a radar. It's like are are P

819
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,220
Speaker 2:  streams different?

820
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:02,910
Speaker 14:  Yes. Well it claims that it can differentiate people by

821
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:06,700
Speaker 14:  their pea streams. So like it's one user per P

822
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:10,630
Speaker 14:  scanner. Okay. So you know, like let's say you have multiple people in your

823
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:14,270
Speaker 14:  house and you don't want your roommate's urinary

824
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:17,850
Speaker 14:  test results. You want yours. Yeah. So it can identify you

825
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:21,580
Speaker 14:  by how you pee and it also can tell the difference

826
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:25,390
Speaker 14:  between like your pee and the water due to temperature sensors.

827
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:29,070
Speaker 14:  So it's just really amazing, thoughtful

828
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:33,040
Speaker 14:  like technology that's gone into this thing that sounds

829
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,720
Speaker 14:  absurd but is actually like medically very cool.

830
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,640
Speaker 14:  Especially like, I think the most relatable use case

831
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,730
Speaker 14:  would be for diabetics, right? Like they have to take urine tests all the

832
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:47,360
Speaker 14:  time to, you know, make sure they're not in keto acidosis. So this

833
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:51,320
Speaker 14:  would make things easier for them because first of all, if you've ever had

834
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:54,830
Speaker 14:  to take a urine sample, I really hope you

835
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:58,800
Speaker 14:  know what your aim is cuz that could be real messy. And

836
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,560
Speaker 14:  this is just you peeing anyway. Oh my god. The, the number of like P

837
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,190
Speaker 14:  facts that I had to learn while writing. You learned a

838
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:05,480
Speaker 2:  Lot.

839
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:09,200
Speaker 14:  I learned so much. Did you know there's 3000 metabolites in

840
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,880
Speaker 14:  your pee? You do now.

841
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,320
Speaker 2:  I didn't even know what a metabolite was until you just said that.

842
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:18,120
Speaker 14:  It's just stuff that tells you about your metabolism. Like ketones, which

843
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,920
Speaker 14:  are a byproduct of breaking down fat.

844
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,320
Speaker 2:  This actually seemed like a cool thing because we're starting to see more

845
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,960
Speaker 2:  of these tests in people's homes instead of just going

846
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,450
Speaker 2:  to the doctors. Like I, I feel like covid

847
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,880
Speaker 2:  really changed things for us. Oh yeah. And so now it's much

848
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,800
Speaker 2:  more acceptable and people feel okay doing, taking these test

849
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,330
Speaker 2:  at

850
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:42,960
Speaker 14:  Home. Oh yeah, for sure. Like, you know, I'm sure everyone's really familiar

851
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,760
Speaker 14:  with the rapid antigen tests, but there were actually molecular tests that

852
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:50,640
Speaker 14:  you could have at home. Like Google sent out the Q hu health test and

853
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,040
Speaker 14:  like of course these were really expensive. Yeah But you know, I had a bunch,

854
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,400
Speaker 14:  I was testing them cuz I was writing about them a few months ago and it's

855
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,160
Speaker 14:  amazing. It's just like this little machine that is there and it uploads

856
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:05,040
Speaker 14:  your results wirelessly to your phone. And so it really makes things

857
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,920
Speaker 14:  easy because you don't have to send things out to a lab and that kind

858
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:12,910
Speaker 14:  of instantaneous knowledge can be really helpful for remote patient monitoring.

859
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:16,520
Speaker 14:  Which a lot of the health tech like that we saw this year was kind

860
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:20,160
Speaker 14:  of around the idea of remote patient monitoring, which is, you know, it's,

861
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,170
Speaker 14:  it's a big foundational gap

862
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:25,400
Speaker 2:  But at the same time isn't there like a lot of approval thing we have to

863
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,480
Speaker 2:  do? Cuz right now we do it in the lab because the lab is controlled setting

864
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,020
Speaker 2:  you're not as likely to screw up your results because you pick your nose

865
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:35,640
Speaker 2:  before you handle something. Don't do that. Just don't do that in general.

866
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,240
Speaker 2:  Wash your hands. But, but like, but there's a lot

867
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:43,200
Speaker 2:  of opportunity to screw up those tests at home. And, and so there,

868
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,910
Speaker 2:  is there a lot of, is there regulation oversight? Like, you wrote a big story

869
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:50,880
Speaker 2:  this last week, I believe Yes. On this stuff. Is it happening? Are

870
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,310
Speaker 2:  we getting oversight?

871
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:56,200
Speaker 14:  So I actually think that the FDA is gonna play a lot bigger role in CAS

872
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:00,080
Speaker 14:  going forward just because, you know, the FDA exists for a very

873
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,360
Speaker 14:  important reason and that is to protect public health. Right? And that's

874
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:07,080
Speaker 14:  so that when you get a health tech gadget, it doesn't kill you.

875
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,550
Speaker 14:  Doesn't hurt you. Yeah. It doesn't put your life in danger in

876
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:14,480
Speaker 14:  any like, shape or form. So like the Y things

877
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,040
Speaker 14:  P scanner, it has to go through the FDA clearance process before it can

878
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,840
Speaker 14:  ever be sold, which is why it's not going to be sold in the US even though

879
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,200
Speaker 14:  it's slated for European release sometime this year.

880
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,440
Speaker 2:  European release,

881
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,240
Speaker 14:  Yeah. You a p. Yes. Yeah. So

882
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,200
Speaker 14:  like, it was really funny because I was writing this story and I was just

883
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,120
Speaker 14:  like, oh my God, here I am again talking about my arch

884
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,880
Speaker 14:  nemesis, the fda. And they're not actually my arch

885
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,680
Speaker 14:  nemesis. They're like, I'm very appreciative of the work that they do. But

886
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,600
Speaker 14:  you know, when you're a health tech writer, when you cover wearables,

887
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:51,560
Speaker 14:  you just kind of learn a lot of jargon and, you know,

888
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:55,200
Speaker 14:  FDA clearance is not the same thing as FDA approval, right? So if you ever

889
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,970
Speaker 14:  see like a report that's like the FDA approved this

890
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:02,760
Speaker 14:  product, or if you're ever shopping for something that says FDA approved,

891
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,520
Speaker 14:  that's the number one tell that they are lying through

892
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:10,080
Speaker 14:  their pants because the FDA does not approve products,

893
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:14,040
Speaker 14:  it clears them. It's just like we've cleared that this has

894
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,950
Speaker 14:  gone through the appropriate testing so that you

895
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:21,600
Speaker 14:  won't likely die. Yeah. Is basically what, what

896
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,200
Speaker 14:  it is. So it, it leaves a really big

897
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,080
Speaker 14:  wide range of things that makes everything

898
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:33,000
Speaker 14:  really confusing in my beat. Yeah. Especially like, I see

899
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,590
Speaker 14:  products all the time, especially in wearables where they're like clinically

900
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:40,560
Speaker 14:  validated. N n no it's not, you're not an FDA regulated device. How are

901
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:44,400
Speaker 14:  you clinically validated? And then if you know, you click on things and

902
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,240
Speaker 14:  you're like, oh, you wrote a white paper that's funded by you,

903
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:52,190
Speaker 14:  of course you, you're getting positive results on, on X, Y, Z.

904
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:52,910
Speaker 14:  Yeah.

905
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:53,670
Speaker 2:  Shocking.

906
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:57,560
Speaker 14:  Shocking. Very, very, not shocking really, but like the whole reason

907
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:01,360
Speaker 14:  why you would want FDA clearance is that you know, you

908
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:05,280
Speaker 14:  can buy it and you can be confident that it's safe

909
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,720
Speaker 14:  for you, that it's gonna work in the way that it's supposed to work. And

910
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,500
Speaker 14:  we're seeing that right now with over-the-counter hearing aids and hearables,

911
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:16,480
Speaker 14:  which I'm telling you that's gonna be a really big thing

912
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,240
Speaker 14:  coming out of wearables this year. Well,

913
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,160
Speaker 2:  Let's, let's talk about that. Cuz we talked about the P sensor and it is,

914
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,440
Speaker 2:  doesn't have FDA clearance

915
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,520
Speaker 14:  Yet. Nope. But

916
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,840
Speaker 2:  It's hoping to have it at some point this year.

917
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,000
Speaker 14:  You know, it's really funny. Every single time I'm like, Hey, are you going

918
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,520
Speaker 14:  through the FDA clearance process? These companies, like the, the heads

919
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,910
Speaker 14:  of them, they're always just like, ugh.

920
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:35,200
Speaker 2:  Yes.

921
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,040
Speaker 14:  I can't tell you when it's coming out. Cuz who knows when the FDA

922
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,960
Speaker 14:  is gonna approve everything. And you know why things is a really good example

923
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,920
Speaker 14:  because they're constantly coming to CES with these really cool health tech

924
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,800
Speaker 14:  products. Yeah. That never make it to the US because it

925
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:53,160
Speaker 14:  takes like two, three years. Okay. Or like, it'll take two, three years

926
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,720
Speaker 14:  before it ever gets to the us. So I think there's like one smartwatch that

927
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,430
Speaker 14:  I saw at CES 2018 that's still not out here. It's it's really

928
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:00,920
Speaker 14:  funny.

929
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:04,880
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It, there was like a watch that was like a blood pressure monitor cuff

930
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,520
Speaker 2:  that I feel just never got approval. Or did that one finally get approval?

931
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:12,040
Speaker 14:  There was the amron blood pressure monitor cough and

932
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,820
Speaker 14:  that got approval like two years later. But it's, it's not like a

933
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:19,760
Speaker 14:  really fun device for normal people to wear. It's if you have hypertension

934
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,280
Speaker 14:  Yeah. You're gonna wear that. I reviewed it many moons ago for Gizmoto.

935
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:23,400
Speaker 14:  There

936
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,440
Speaker 2:  You go. I vaguely remember that. Product. Product. But let's talk about,

937
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:29,800
Speaker 2:  let's talk about the hearables and, and the hearing aid place because I think

938
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:33,720
Speaker 2:  last year kind of set the stage for that, right? Like was it last year that

939
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,680
Speaker 2:  they said we were gonna do over-the-counter hearing aids? You won't have

940
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:40,440
Speaker 2:  to go to an audiologist, you won't have to go to a, you just

941
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,200
Speaker 2:  go buy 'em.

942
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,720
Speaker 14:  Yeah, no, this has actually been in the works for five years. Wow. This

943
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,280
Speaker 14:  is what I'm telling you. Tech moves fast,

944
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:52,200
Speaker 14:  medicine moves slow. So health tech moves

945
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,960
Speaker 14:  at the speed of a snail. Like it's just like

946
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:59,800
Speaker 14:  inching along all the time. But so this, this has been in the process

947
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:03,480
Speaker 14:  for over five years. It took like, I think Trump was the

948
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,760
Speaker 14:  first president to be like, yeah, we're gonna do this. And then, I mean,

949
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:10,600
Speaker 14:  he's gone now, right? Yeah. It just got approved. The, the

950
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:14,200
Speaker 14:  ruling got approved last year in the middle of the year and then

951
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,830
Speaker 14:  the products didn't start hitting shells until

952
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:21,440
Speaker 14:  mid-October. Okay. So we're still in the very, very, very, very early stages

953
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,040
Speaker 14:  of over-the-counter hearing aids. But you know, this is a whole

954
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,520
Speaker 14:  minefield because if I tell you over-the-counter hearing aids versus over-the-counter

955
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:32,440
Speaker 14:  self fitting hearing aids versus hearing aids, these are all different things.

956
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,240
Speaker 2:  They all fundamentally do the same thing. Right? Like they all go in your

957
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,860
Speaker 2:  ear and they assist you in hearing

958
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:40,600
Speaker 14:  Better fundamentally they go in your ear and you hear better.

959
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,340
Speaker 14:  Okay.

960
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:41,880
Speaker 2:  Yes. But

961
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,620
Speaker 14:  They do different things To different

962
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:49,440
Speaker 14:  degrees and it's very confusing. I have been like, I have been reporting

963
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,080
Speaker 14:  on this for like three months at this point talking to a lot of different

964
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:57,040
Speaker 14:  audiologists and it's, it's a nightmare. Like Yeah. I, I just,

965
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,880
Speaker 14:  it's, it's very confusing and it's going to be confusing until like the

966
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,800
Speaker 14:  dust settles a little bit. But with regard to the fda, it's great that

967
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,560
Speaker 14:  they have over-the-counter hearing aids because now you can go into the

968
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:12,480
Speaker 14:  store, they'll be at your Best Buy, they'll be at your local, like,

969
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,100
Speaker 14:  I don't know your Duane Reed or Walmart. Yeah. Like those

970
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:19,920
Speaker 14:  places and yeah, you can buy them and you can know that the FDA

971
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,360
Speaker 14:  tested it and you're not going to damage your hearing because they regulate

972
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:27,240
Speaker 14:  the output levels of sound. There's gonna be a degree where you're

973
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:31,000
Speaker 14:  able to kind of self fitting means you'll be able to like have a little

974
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,960
Speaker 14:  hearing test in, in an app and it'll be personalized to you. Okay.

975
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,920
Speaker 14:  So great. Cool. There's already products out here that kind

976
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,680
Speaker 14:  of do that that are not hearing aids and that do not have FDA

977
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:42,960
Speaker 14:  regulation

978
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,920
Speaker 2:  Like I'm wearing AirPods.

979
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:48,760
Speaker 14:  AirPods are one of the, the things that are like really interesting,

980
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,680
Speaker 14:  right? Because they have conversation boost, conversation boost,

981
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,160
Speaker 14:  you know, it makes people's voices easier to hear in

982
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:00,000
Speaker 14:  louder environments. That's what a hearing aid does. The AirPods are not

983
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,600
Speaker 14:  a hearing aid because they have not been regulated for output

984
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:07,400
Speaker 14:  levels. They don't necessarily do everything that a hearing aid

985
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,360
Speaker 14:  needs to do. And I think what's gonna be interesting going forward is

986
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:15,200
Speaker 14:  you might see some consumer audio companies just like pull back their,

987
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,360
Speaker 14:  their features.

988
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,120
Speaker 2:  Oh, interesting.

989
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:20,480
Speaker 14:  Well it's cuz like the, the question, and I get it this get into this in

990
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,710
Speaker 14:  my piece, the question that they have to ask themselves

991
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:27,320
Speaker 14:  is, well, do I wanna be regulated by the F D A and go

992
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:31,240
Speaker 14:  through everything that involves an F D A clearance process?

993
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,520
Speaker 14:  There's there's a lot.

994
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:32,920
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

995
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,400
Speaker 14:  There's a lot that goes into that. Well,

996
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,160
Speaker 2:  Do they have to go into the F FDA clearance process? Like is Apple

997
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,680
Speaker 2:  gonna have to get new generations of

998
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,160
Speaker 2:  AirPods approved?

999
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:46,960
Speaker 14:  That is unclear at the moment because this is so new and everything is

1000
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,680
Speaker 14:  shaking out. But say the FDA were to look at a

1001
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,960
Speaker 14:  feature like this is all hypothetical, but say the FDA were to look at a

1002
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:57,680
Speaker 14:  feature like AirPods conversation Boost on the pro, right? And they

1003
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,360
Speaker 14:  went, Hey, that's really similar to hearing aids and we think that that

1004
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,800
Speaker 14:  should be regulated

1005
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,890
Speaker 2:  So that we don't bust eardrums with loud noises.

1006
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:09,560
Speaker 14:  Right. So let's say that they say that aspect is

1007
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:13,480
Speaker 14:  really similar to a hearing aid, an over counter hearing aid. You now need

1008
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:17,200
Speaker 14:  to go through compliance, you need to show us that you

1009
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:21,160
Speaker 14:  are able to meet all of these factors. And you know, that

1010
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:25,080
Speaker 14:  involves a lot. Like I talked to Moo Health and they're,

1011
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,880
Speaker 14:  they're a really fascinating company. They're making a smart ring that's

1012
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:31,600
Speaker 14:  for women. Women first. Love this. That's going to be

1013
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:35,410
Speaker 14:  a fully FDA cleared medical device. Which is

1014
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:39,230
Speaker 14:  amazing because you know, you have the Apple Watch that's not an FDA cleared

1015
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:43,080
Speaker 14:  device. It's a device that has an FDA cleared feature. So now you see why

1016
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:46,680
Speaker 14:  I rip out my hair every single time I write about this stuff. It's

1017
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:50,580
Speaker 14:  very nuanced, very complicated. But you know, I was talking to their

1018
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:54,040
Speaker 14:  CEO and he has like a wealth of knowledge because he spent

1019
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:58,000
Speaker 14:  like 30 years making products for people with diabetes. Okay. And

1020
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,730
Speaker 14:  those are all medical devices. Right. So he was telling me that, you

1021
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:05,160
Speaker 14:  know, we focus on like accuracy a lot with

1022
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:08,680
Speaker 14:  FDA clearance accuracy is less than 1% of what goes into an

1023
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:12,600
Speaker 14:  FDA filing. They have to be HIPAA compliant. They have to show that, you

1024
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:16,280
Speaker 14:  know, your data is encrypted. They have to show out what the

1025
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:20,150
Speaker 14:  communication protocols are. They have to have that tested by an independent

1026
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:23,600
Speaker 14:  party. They have to have their devices manufactured at a

1027
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:27,480
Speaker 14:  medical device factory. They can't go to like consumer grade. Yeah. For

1028
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:31,280
Speaker 14:  that. That is like a whole nightmare. And even, even

1029
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:35,120
Speaker 14:  even even with the clinical accuracy testing, like he described

1030
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:38,600
Speaker 14:  the process to me and like the hypoxia trial, which is, you know,

1031
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,240
Speaker 14:  oxygen deficiency. You basically have to take a person

1032
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:46,000
Speaker 14:  both genders and all skin tones and

1033
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,880
Speaker 14:  lower their oxygen levels bit by bit and

1034
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:53,400
Speaker 14:  then blind check all, all the data. So it's, it's like

1035
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:57,080
Speaker 14:  incredibly intense, expensive and like the

1036
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:00,750
Speaker 14:  regulatory paperwork, I just, I don't wanna be the person who handles that

1037
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:02,480
Speaker 14:  paperwork. It's a nightmare. But

1038
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,280
Speaker 2:  It also is good in the long run because then we

1039
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:10,080
Speaker 2:  don't like people of various skin tones can go and get a device and know

1040
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,000
Speaker 2:  that it will work.

1041
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,590
Speaker 14:  I've actually been asking a lot of these wearable makers about skin tones

1042
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:18,720
Speaker 14:  because I think there was a thing that came out a while back that was saying

1043
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,480
Speaker 14:  that pulse oximeters were not equally good for people

1044
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,400
Speaker 14:  of darker skin. And all these companies will tell you like yeah, that's

1045
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,520
Speaker 14:  true. Just because of the way the technology works. It works by reflecting

1046
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:33,150
Speaker 14:  light into your skin and people with more melanin will reflect less light

1047
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:36,760
Speaker 14:  back. That's just kind of a flaw of the, the

1048
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:40,520
Speaker 14:  actual technology itself. Right. But you know, I'm asking them about what

1049
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:44,280
Speaker 14:  their, their protocols for testing with people of

1050
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,960
Speaker 14:  different skin tones are. And if you're FDA regulated, you have to prove,

1051
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,200
Speaker 14:  you have to prove that you work just as well across all skin tones. If you're

1052
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,920
Speaker 14:  not FDA regulated, you don't really have to prove nothing. Right. Yeah.

1053
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:58,800
Speaker 14:  You can say that we're super accurate and we just have to trust that you've

1054
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,440
Speaker 14:  done the testing and

1055
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:04,280
Speaker 2:  Then you Victoria have to go find a bunch of people and test it

1056
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,600
Speaker 2:  for a wonderful video on the verge.com.

1057
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:10,000
Speaker 14:  I I mean yeah, it's gonna be super unscientific,

1058
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,680
Speaker 14:  but yeah, like it's, you know, and you know, I've been asking them

1059
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,600
Speaker 14:  recently about tattoos as well because that's another thing where

1060
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,520
Speaker 14:  you see all these people online going like, oh my god, my Apple watch doesn't

1061
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,160
Speaker 14:  work and

1062
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,120
Speaker 2:  It's cuz they have a tattoo

1063
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:25,480
Speaker 14:  Because I have tattoos. And and it's like, yeah, that's actually a, a real

1064
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:29,240
Speaker 14:  problem again because when you tattoo your skin you're,

1065
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:32,400
Speaker 14:  you're putting ink there and making it really difficult for the light to

1066
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,200
Speaker 14:  reflect off. So these are, these are problems where if you were

1067
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,730
Speaker 14:  FDA regulated they would be less of a problem because before it could ever

1068
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:43,070
Speaker 14:  go to market, you'd have to prove that you are

1069
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:46,680
Speaker 14:  clinically like clinical grade accurate. Whereas, you know, most of the

1070
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:50,160
Speaker 14:  consumer products out there that claim to do SPO two, they don't have to

1071
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,840
Speaker 14:  do that. I've tested a bunch of products and you can read my

1072
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:56,560
Speaker 14:  reviews where they say I have an SPO two level

1073
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:00,520
Speaker 14:  of 83%. If you have an SPO two level of 83%,

1074
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:04,160
Speaker 14:  you best be in an ambulance on your way to the hospital that is

1075
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,680
Speaker 14:  below what the, what like is acceptable or her people with copti. Yeah.

1076
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:11,480
Speaker 14:  So it's, it's just like, like this, this device

1077
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,560
Speaker 2:  Call 9 1 1

1078
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:15,280
Speaker 14:  And they get away with it because they say we're a wellness device, we're

1079
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:18,960
Speaker 14:  not a medical device. So you just like, I guess what I'm getting at is like

1080
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,600
Speaker 14:  you're gonna see the lines blurring between what is and what isn't a medical

1081
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,800
Speaker 14:  device, which means the FDA is gonna have to, you know, like put on their

1082
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:29,380
Speaker 14:  big boy pants, not that they aren't on already, but even bigger big boy

1083
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:33,240
Speaker 14:  pants and just go like, okay we kind of have to

1084
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:36,610
Speaker 14:  sort out the mess that is the consumer health tech product

1085
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:40,560
Speaker 14:  world because it's, it's a mess. It's a real mess. Like I gotta tell you.

1086
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:44,160
Speaker 2:  Do you think they're going to, I mean they kind of have to with the hearing

1087
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:47,830
Speaker 2:  aids cuz they opened this can of words. So they're kind of

1088
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:48,970
Speaker 2:  stuck with hearing

1089
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:52,840
Speaker 14:  Aids, they're stuck with hearing aids. The, they brought this upon themselves.

1090
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:56,320
Speaker 14:  They have to do that. But I think you're gonna start to see it more and

1091
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:00,080
Speaker 14:  more often. Like Apple was a really good example when they brought

1092
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:03,680
Speaker 14:  out EKGs, right? Right. When they brought out EKGs on the series four, it

1093
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:07,320
Speaker 14:  had to go through the FDA de novo clearance process

1094
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:11,280
Speaker 14:  and basically they had to do that because they were having some

1095
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,760
Speaker 14:  sort of diagnostic capability. It's not really diagnosing, but it's

1096
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:18,640
Speaker 14:  saying, Hey you might have AFib, you should go see a doctor.

1097
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:22,260
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And it even says when you go and run one, it's like this is

1098
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:26,130
Speaker 2:  not the same thing as going to the doctors. If you feel bad, call 9 1

1099
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:27,590
Speaker 2:  1, don't just check in on your

1100
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:31,340
Speaker 14:  Watch. Yeah. Like there's a lot of like medical descriptions down

1101
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:35,160
Speaker 14:  there, but you know, it does have some sort of a

1102
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:38,960
Speaker 14:  detection capability. Right? Yeah. So the thing with SPO two sensors

1103
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:42,760
Speaker 14:  and why you see all these SPO two sensors, even though functionally they

1104
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:46,680
Speaker 14:  don't do JAK right now at least is, you know, Fitbit

1105
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,200
Speaker 14:  has been doing this for a really long time, but they're trying to detect

1106
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:53,160
Speaker 14:  sleep apnea. Yeah. Using your blood oxygen. Now

1107
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:56,200
Speaker 14:  if they were to say that they could detect sleep apnea while the FDA would

1108
01:02:56,200 --> 01:03:00,000
Speaker 14:  have to get involved and what they would like to do is for someone

1109
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,160
Speaker 14:  else to figure it out and go through the process so then they can ride

1110
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:06,710
Speaker 14:  those coattails basically. Right. And then, you

1111
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:10,640
Speaker 14:  know, have this thing out there. So they have the sensors on there just

1112
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:14,040
Speaker 14:  hoping that someone else is gonna do the dirty work. And I see a lot of

1113
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:17,740
Speaker 14:  that of just these companies going around putting the sensors in for future

1114
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:21,200
Speaker 14:  proofing and then hoping someone else does the dirty work to get the

1115
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,520
Speaker 14:  clearance. Because once one, one person gets it cleared, the rest of them

1116
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:28,470
Speaker 14:  will follow. So there, there's a lot of that going on. Just the

1117
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:32,030
Speaker 14:  FDA just sits there and it's, it's very like, I wanna emphasize that it's

1118
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:35,920
Speaker 14:  very good that the FDA does this because, you know, I

1119
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:39,480
Speaker 14:  think the next frontier of wearables is going to be non-invasive

1120
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,800
Speaker 14:  blood glucose monitoring. Right. Which will be so

1121
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:46,680
Speaker 14:  great for diabetics, but that's life or death. You

1122
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:50,600
Speaker 14:  cannot f that up. Yeah. You, you cannot screw up someone's blood

1123
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:51,960
Speaker 14:  sugar levels. You

1124
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,400
Speaker 2:  Will, you'll kill someone, you

1125
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:57,240
Speaker 14:  Will kill someone, you will be sued. You need the F D A to regulate

1126
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:00,240
Speaker 14:  the hell out of that. And and the same goes for blood pressure. Which was

1127
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,600
Speaker 14:  another thing at CES with valent cell, which, you know, I love catching

1128
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,360
Speaker 14:  up with valent cell every year cuz nobody knows

1129
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:09,160
Speaker 2:  They, they did the finger one, right?

1130
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:12,520
Speaker 14:  Like I've been talking to Val and Cell for the last five, six years at every

1131
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:16,400
Speaker 14:  CS just going, Hey guys, what's up? Because they make optical sensor

1132
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:20,070
Speaker 14:  tech that goes into a lot of wearables that you may already have

1133
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:24,020
Speaker 14:  like jabs, bows, lg, like their tech isn't a lot of stuff.

1134
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:27,360
Speaker 14:  Yeah. But you've never heard of them cuz they're a B2B company. But you

1135
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:30,800
Speaker 14:  know, this year they're like, we're gonna make our own thing because the

1136
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:34,700
Speaker 14:  gosh dang FDA won't approve our tech unless it's in a commercial

1137
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:38,420
Speaker 14:  product. And we tried to get other people to make it and they wouldn't.

1138
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:41,440
Speaker 14:  So now we're here and we have to make this

1139
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:45,240
Speaker 14:  tech ourselves because this is just the state of things

1140
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:49,040
Speaker 14:  and it's, it's really cool tech. It is a fingertip blood

1141
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:52,760
Speaker 14:  pressure monitor that looks like one of those fingertip pulse

1142
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:56,320
Speaker 14:  oximeters. Right. And you know, it, it's, it's supposedly will be able to

1143
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:59,200
Speaker 14:  take an accurate blood pressure reading without you having to use a cough

1144
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:03,050
Speaker 14:  and without you having to calibrate anything. So that would be like, you

1145
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:06,400
Speaker 14:  know, oh, huge to have in like the consumer world that would, that would

1146
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:10,120
Speaker 14:  just change hypertension treatment. It, it's, it's like

1147
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:13,440
Speaker 14:  mind staggeringly amazing what that could do if

1148
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,160
Speaker 14:  it gets FDA clearance. Yeah.

1149
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:19,960
Speaker 2:  I mean as, as somebody who has blood pressure issues, I, you know, if

1150
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,440
Speaker 2:  I wanna take my blood pressure, I have to like make sure my arm is bare.

1151
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,920
Speaker 2:  Because if you take it over a sweater, you'll look like you're dying and

1152
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:30,120
Speaker 2:  then you'll have panic and talk to your doctor who will say no, take your

1153
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:34,080
Speaker 2:  shirt off for it. Like reveal your, your, your arm. And so

1154
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:38,040
Speaker 2:  it seems like a really, really cool thing. But also I was, it seemed like

1155
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:41,560
Speaker 2:  it was also still kind of not accurate just from the reports we were getting

1156
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:43,200
Speaker 2:  out of ces.

1157
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,840
Speaker 14:  I mean, you are on a show floor, so there's gonna be

1158
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:50,600
Speaker 14:  a degree of whatevers, but if they pass

1159
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:54,360
Speaker 14:  FDA clearance, that's gonna assure a degree of accuracy. You know, so like,

1160
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:57,440
Speaker 14:  if they get FDA clearance, then you can be like, oh, well maybe that was

1161
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,920
Speaker 14:  just because it was on the show floor, it was a prototype. You, you know,

1162
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:04,600
Speaker 14:  it's, it's hard to really gauge what the accuracy is gonna be in

1163
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:08,400
Speaker 14:  like a CS type setting. But, you know, it's, it's, it's

1164
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,240
Speaker 14:  like huge. It's innovative tech. It's stuff that we should be pursuing.

1165
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,040
Speaker 14:  But you know, companies look at that and they go like, ah, Jesus Christ,

1166
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,560
Speaker 14:  I don't got the time. I don't got the

1167
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,040
Speaker 2:  Time for this, the time, the money.

1168
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,960
Speaker 14:  Hopefully someone else will do it. It's expensive. Yeah. It's so much

1169
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:24,840
Speaker 14:  paperwork involved. It's, it's, and you know, you want that, you want to

1170
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:28,650
Speaker 14:  be safe, you want to not die. Like whenever Elon

1171
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:32,240
Speaker 14:  Musk, if he ever actually does Neuralink, I want the FDA

1172
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,200
Speaker 14:  involved like,

1173
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:36,840
Speaker 2:  Oh, you, you don't wanna put a chip in your brain without FDA

1174
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:40,480
Speaker 2:  approval that it won't kill you. Like it's killed mini, mini monkeys shocky.

1175
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:44,400
Speaker 14:  I want documentation to be there that this is like safe for

1176
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,560
Speaker 14:  the marketplace. Yeah. I don't wanna have to like, like, and that's, that's

1177
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:51,360
Speaker 14:  the really frustrating thing about my beat because so much of it conceptually

1178
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:54,960
Speaker 14:  is really cool and we have the technology, but the willing, and this

1179
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:58,670
Speaker 14:  is capitalism, like the willingness of companies to invest in

1180
01:06:58,670 --> 01:07:02,640
Speaker 14:  this technology versus the effort that's gonna go in

1181
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:06,520
Speaker 14:  to getting through the FDA regulation process is nil. It's

1182
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:10,400
Speaker 14:  just nothing. It's, they would rather play in the wellness

1183
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:14,040
Speaker 14:  space cuz the FDA don't care if you wanna log every night of

1184
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:17,840
Speaker 14:  sleep from now until you die. They're cool with that. Cuz that's just for

1185
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:21,530
Speaker 14:  you. That's yeah, that's for your knowledge. That's not like

1186
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:25,240
Speaker 14:  substantially, if your sleep tracking is inaccurate to a degree, you're

1187
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:28,640
Speaker 14:  not gonna die from that reasonably speaking. You're not gonna die from that.

1188
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:31,720
Speaker 14:  You're just gonna be like, oh my God, it's inaccurate. Which, you know,

1189
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:35,680
Speaker 14:  it's all inaccurate anyway, so yeah. Now, now you know why, like when

1190
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:39,600
Speaker 14:  my editors come to the FDA articles, they're just like, oh

1191
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:40,380
Speaker 14:  God,

1192
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:43,240
Speaker 2:  Okay. You have to brace yourself whenever, whenever I'm about to edit one

1193
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:46,360
Speaker 2:  of your stories and it's got f d in it. I'm like, okay, I have to like, put

1194
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:49,520
Speaker 2:  on my, like, I have to think really hard. It's like reading, it's

1195
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:53,280
Speaker 2:  like editing anything, anything legal. But those f d ones are rough.

1196
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:54,640
Speaker 14:  They're, they're super rough.

1197
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:57,840
Speaker 2:  Wonderful copy though. The copy is beautiful. Thinking about F D

1198
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:01,360
