00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,160
Speaker 1:  Greetings mobile. Accomplishers welcome to the Vergecast. My name is Dieter

20
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,730
Speaker 1:  Bohn, and you are listening to our special series of topics

21
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,510
Speaker 1:  specific Tuesday episodes this week. The topic is

22
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,810
Speaker 1:  Eero and that's because we are bringing you an interview that Neil Patel

23
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,590
Speaker 1:  and I did with the CEO of Eero Nick Weaver. We have this interview back at

24
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,490
Speaker 1:  our 10 year anniversary party conference festival thing

25
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,450
Speaker 1:  called how the verge in New York city. It was a ton of fun. It was a huge

26
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,780
Speaker 1:  blast. And so we're happy to bring some of the things that happened at this

27
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,260
Speaker 1:  event to you, if you couldn't make it out to the party, but if you could

28
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,020
Speaker 1:  thanks so much for coming, it was great to see you anyway, with this interview

29
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,320
Speaker 1:  with Nick, I want you to pay special attention to the pieces where we began

30
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,220
Speaker 1:  to talk about thread and matter. So thread, if you're not

31
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,210
Speaker 1:  familiar with it is a kind of radio for smart home devices that Eero

32
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,120
Speaker 1:  in particular, but a lot of people in general have been hyping for several

33
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,900
Speaker 1:  years now, but never seems to amount anything, but it seems like it's actually

34
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,290
Speaker 1:  about to become super important. And it's about to become super important

35
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,830
Speaker 1:  because there is another smart home standard called matter, which is the

36
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,610
Speaker 1:  standard that used to be known as connected home over IP. Or you could have

37
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,090
Speaker 1:  called it the chip, or yeah, you could call it choice. If you wanted to be

38
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,960
Speaker 1:  a weirdo like me. Anyway, it's the standard that's supposed to make smart

39
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,830
Speaker 1:  home gadgets, all talk to each other, and arrow's whole jam is connecting

40
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,370
Speaker 1:  things in your home. They make wifi routers and they also now make a version

41
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,000
Speaker 1:  of arrow that connects up to a ring pro and can actually provide back up

42
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,780
Speaker 1:  internet over LTE for when your internet goes down. So we

43
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,080
Speaker 1:  discuss all of these things, but the reason I'm bringing up matter and thread

44
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,590
Speaker 1:  in particular is because in a couple of weeks after we get through the holiday

45
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,430
Speaker 1:  break, we're going to bring you one last topic specific episode on Tuesday.

46
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,450
Speaker 1:  That will be all about matter. We're going to get to the bottom of whether

47
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,290
Speaker 1:  or not the hype is real and what's going on with it. But in the meantime,

48
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,900
Speaker 1:  there's a lot of really interesting things here with Nick. And so I hope

49
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,290
Speaker 1:  you enjoy

50
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,710
Speaker 1:  <inaudible>

51
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,500
Speaker 1:  I, this

52
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,490
Speaker 3:  Foreboding distance that I know you got you over there, what's going to

53
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,210
Speaker 3:  happen in Nash.

54
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,070
Speaker 4:  There's actually a bucket of water. You know, just if you answer a question.

55
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,480
Speaker 4:  Yeah, perfect. So I actually want to start with the

56
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,990
Speaker 4:  new product that you made Amazon made

57
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,010
Speaker 4:  <inaudible> yeah, there's a ring alarm pro, and

58
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,770
Speaker 4:  if you're not familiar, one of the cool things about it is it has IRO built

59
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,580
Speaker 4:  in. And how did that happen? Did you make it that they call you and

60
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,080
Speaker 4:  ask you, like what happened there?

61
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,130
Speaker 3:  We really just started with what are the problems that people are trying

62
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,100
Speaker 3:  to solve in their home. And when you have a camera,

63
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,750
Speaker 3:  wifi is really important. So the whole premise there was, how can we

64
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,740
Speaker 3:  make things as easy as possible for customers make it easy to set

65
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,460
Speaker 3:  up, make sure you've got super reliable wifi. So your cameras stay connected

66
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,130
Speaker 3:  and integrated all into one one device.

67
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,240
Speaker 4:  So it makes perfect sense to put wifi into a device like ring, but

68
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,390
Speaker 4:  again, like, did they ask you, did you, are you all in the room all the time?

69
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,120
Speaker 4:  Are you all just one big company now, or phone call, how does that work

70
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,170
Speaker 3:  Phone call meeting? We all know how to reach each other. And

71
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,410
Speaker 3:  just a lot of it starts with thinking about what problems we're hearing from

72
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,400
Speaker 3:  customers and deciding if we want to go work on a solution together or

73
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,220
Speaker 3:  independently, there's a lot of flexibility.

74
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,880
Speaker 4:  Well, I mean, I look at all the smart home gadgets now in my house and I

75
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,190
Speaker 4:  think, well, that should have wifi. That should be a router. That should

76
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,130
Speaker 4:  be a router. Like why ring and nod and echo. Okay.

77
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,820
Speaker 3:  I think there with echo devices, you've got them everywhere in the

78
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,570
Speaker 3:  house, and there's a lot of places where you want a voice assistant that

79
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,500
Speaker 3:  doesn't necessarily have the best wifi coverage. There's a lot of places

80
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,160
Speaker 3:  where you need great wifi coverage. It's not a great place for a voice

81
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,060
Speaker 3:  assistant. So, you know, for instance, there's a lot of routers

82
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,660
Speaker 3:  in people's closets. That's where the internet comes in, not a good place

83
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,350
Speaker 3:  for voice assistant. So a lot of the thinking is, Hey, where can we

84
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,010
Speaker 3:  converge devices where it makes sense for customers and putting it into a

85
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,180
Speaker 3:  fully comprehensive alarm base station makes a lot of sense,

86
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:02,290
Speaker 3:  but like an echo in your kitchen is a great place for a router. It could

87
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,430
Speaker 3:  be, will it be,

88
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,070
Speaker 3:  You know, we've looked at everything and

89
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,360
Speaker 3:  you know, in the future who knows it might, it might make sense to

90
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,910
Speaker 3:  converge more of those devices than we have

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,180
Speaker 4:  In the past. The other genius thing about the ring alarm pro is that it has

92
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,020
Speaker 4:  a backup LTE modem. So if your internet goes out, you can

93
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,770
Speaker 4:  have a backup internet. I forget the exact name. Once you get over

94
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,220
Speaker 4:  LTE for a little while, so that you're not just knocked offline,

95
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,770
Speaker 4:  Y Y LTE and non 5g.

96
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,240
Speaker 3:  And we're looking at, you know, what's required for, for an

97
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,080
Speaker 3:  alarm system, LTE provides just, you know,

98
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,000
Speaker 3:  just enough connectivity that you need. You know, this is not really supposed

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,900
Speaker 3:  to be your high-speed primary internet connection. We want you to be

100
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,350
Speaker 3:  able to stay online and then with, you know, 5g still

101
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,740
Speaker 3:  evolving and depending on what flavor of 5g,

102
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,770
Speaker 3:  sometimes it doesn't get through walls particularly well. And

103
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,280
Speaker 3:  so that was one of the considerations that went into that product decision.

104
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:04,880
Speaker 3:  Specifically,

105
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,900
Speaker 5:  There are some flavors of 5g that you're like, millimeter wave doesn't go

106
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,410
Speaker 5:  through walls. But also, like, I don't think a lot of people are setting

107
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,950
Speaker 5:  up ring camera system is under like one streetlight in New York

108
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,820
Speaker 5:  city. It's like, it's just like you holding your floodlight cam. I

109
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,910
Speaker 5:  get the, just enough arguing, but there's another argument that you would

110
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,760
Speaker 5:  want to fail over to 5g when you're in air. It goes down and that would be

111
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,300
Speaker 5:  really fast. There are the home internet services from their providers.

112
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,130
Speaker 5:  Is that, do you see that as a

113
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,450
Speaker 3:  Path? I think when we look at the performance and reliability of

114
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,530
Speaker 3:  Eero networks, just across the U S across the globe, there

115
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,340
Speaker 3:  is a subset of customers where fail-over could

116
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,060
Speaker 3:  and would be really valuable. So it's certainly something we've

117
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,960
Speaker 3:  been exploring. You know, a lot of it comes down to the amount of

118
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,350
Speaker 3:  data you're going to use. Cellular is fairly expensive.

119
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:58,310
Speaker 3:  And in particular with 5g, it's super fast speeds. You can consume a

120
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:02,030
Speaker 3:  lot of data really quickly, and the cost per gigabyte is still

121
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:02,720
Speaker 3:  fairly high.

122
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,870
Speaker 4:  Okay. So if we're talking about 5g, I think our audience knows that 5g is

123
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,770
Speaker 4:  a race and we're, we're winning. We've lost.

124
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,460
Speaker 4:  Do you feel like you're in a race with 5g? Cause like the claim has been,

125
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,830
Speaker 4:  well, we're not going to need wifi anymore. Everything's going to have 5g.

126
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,360
Speaker 4:  It'll be great.

127
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,540
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I think 5g and wifi are really great.

128
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,170
Speaker 3:  Complimentary technologies, cost of cellular is

129
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,860
Speaker 3:  really expensive. Cost of 5g, very expensive. We're

130
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,700
Speaker 3:  talking not one, but frequently two orders of magnitude

131
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,330
Speaker 3:  more in terms of putting a wifi chip set into a

132
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:39,320
Speaker 3:  device versus a 5g modem. And so 5g is

133
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,250
Speaker 3:  great for coming into the home, but for getting it to all the devices around

134
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,940
Speaker 3:  your house, paying that cost on a per device basis just

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,990
Speaker 3:  doesn't make sense. You also, you miss out on having, you

136
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,860
Speaker 3:  know, your own local network. That's one of the great things about running

137
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,490
Speaker 3:  your own network. You get a firewall, you can set rules, you can keep your

138
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,180
Speaker 3:  devices safe and secure and you lose a lot of that control and

139
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:06,170
Speaker 3:  capability if it's all connecting directly to a cellular network,

140
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,320
Speaker 4:  Right? So you don't feel any competition at all from, from 5g.

141
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,990
Speaker 3:  I think again, it's a really great

142
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,870
Speaker 5:  Complimentary technology, anything at all from 5g. I

143
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,830
Speaker 4:  Mean, there's that,

144
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,730
Speaker 5:  I mean, that's like kind of the big question is yep, I get it. You need to

145
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,610
Speaker 5:  connect. You need a fast connection to your house. They needed to redistribute

146
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:26,420
Speaker 5:  it to all the things, your house. Are you seeing a higher attach rate of

147
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,410
Speaker 5:  like T-Mobile at home 5g or Verizon as a fixed

148
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,770
Speaker 5:  service and like Texas, are you seeing those numbers tick up

149
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,840
Speaker 5:  versus straight cable?

150
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,890
Speaker 3:  I think th th the biggest trend we are seeing, it's just, people are

151
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,840
Speaker 3:  upgrading to gigabit and droves. They want gigabit. They want faster than

152
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:47,570
Speaker 3:  gigabit. A lot of people are sitting at home doing everything, school

153
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,230
Speaker 3:  work entertainment, and they just want more speed,

154
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,680
Speaker 3:  more bandwidth to do all the things they need to do from home. So we've just

155
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,460
Speaker 3:  seen really, really significant adoption

156
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,760
Speaker 3:  of gigabit internet and not trend is not slowing down.

157
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,170
Speaker 4:  Here's a weird one. I have gigabit internet and it's sucks because

158
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,090
Speaker 5:  We fixed Dieter's network right here. Right

159
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,720
Speaker 4:  Now. My download speeds are okay. My upload speeds are garbage, and that's

160
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,350
Speaker 4:  very common in the U S especially with cable. When you're

161
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,040
Speaker 4:  designing routers, are you like, are you designing for an idealized world

162
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,370
Speaker 4:  where we all have actually good internet from good companies, or are you

163
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,250
Speaker 4:  designing it with the realities of what you think customers are actually

164
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,090
Speaker 4:  going to be able to do?

165
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:31,260
Speaker 3:  When we're designing our products, it's being designed independent

166
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,800
Speaker 3:  of your internet connection. We are just trying to make our

167
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,700
Speaker 3:  radios, our RF performance as high quality

168
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,420
Speaker 3:  as we possibly can. We want it to be as reliable as it can,

169
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,110
Speaker 3:  and we want to hit the highest bandwidth metrics that's

170
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,980
Speaker 3:  possible with that design. And so if you hook it up to a

171
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,880
Speaker 3:  symmetric gigabit connection, great, if you hook it up to a gigabit

172
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,330
Speaker 3:  connection with 10 megabits up, you know, you're not going to

173
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,290
Speaker 3:  see great upload speeds because you're limited by the pipe coming into

174
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:05,070
Speaker 3:  your home. But the Eero network is going to perform as well as

175
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,450
Speaker 3:  we possibly can make it

176
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,650
Speaker 5:  With gigabit. One of the right, we need wifi six to really take advantage

177
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,490
Speaker 5:  of gigabit. Now there's six E scrape. The names are great. We're

178
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,390
Speaker 5:  very proud of the whole industry. Constantly. It's improving. That's a

179
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:22,230
Speaker 5:  low floor and we've noticed the wifi

180
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,380
Speaker 5:  six products are still wildly expensive. It's been like a year and a half,

181
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:29,520
Speaker 5:  maybe more. There's just a cost penalty for this stuff. Is

182
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,240
Speaker 5:  that because there's not enough. They haven't had scale. Why, why that

183
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,960
Speaker 5:  cost penalty?

184
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:38,280
Speaker 3:  It's just a transition. And everybody has been hearing about this for

185
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,970
Speaker 3:  months and months and months. The supply chains also backed up

186
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:45,690
Speaker 3:  and things are a lot more expensive. It's chips are more

187
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,480
Speaker 3:  expensive. Labor's more expensive.

188
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,000
Speaker 3:  Shipping is more expensive.

189
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,960
Speaker 5:  There's just like full of arrows, just like floating around.

190
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,460
Speaker 3:  There's probably a few of them at this point.

191
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,370
Speaker 5:  Is that something that you pay attention to, is the CEO like, do you get

192
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,850
Speaker 5:  a report? That's like, we actually, can't, we're waiting for a container

193
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,990
Speaker 5:  to unload with product.

194
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,040
Speaker 3:  I've spent more time on the phone with our head of manufacturing operations

195
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,700
Speaker 3:  in the last year and a half than I think we had in the last three

196
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,510
Speaker 3:  years or four years before that it has consumed a lot of

197
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,380
Speaker 3:  time and energy. And our teams have been just

198
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,950
Speaker 3:  working around the clock. You know, you fix one problem. Another one pops

199
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:29,280
Speaker 3:  up. It's a huge, huge game of whack-a-mole. And in

200
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,610
Speaker 3:  particular getting product to customers like that is something

201
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,440
Speaker 3:  I'm really involved in.

202
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,490
Speaker 4:  It actually surprises me because I would assume if you guys don't know arrows

203
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,970
Speaker 4:  bought by Amazon, that you've got Amazon, who's pretty good at logistics.

204
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,780
Speaker 4:  I would think that you could let them handle that. So like w what is

205
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,680
Speaker 4:  Amazon doing in terms of, you know, working with customers? I'm sure they're

206
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,320
Speaker 4:  handling much like HR and corporate stuff for you, but like, what's your

207
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,910
Speaker 4:  relationship with Amazon? There's a ring over there. You work with them,

208
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:58,180
Speaker 4:  but what do they do? What do you still like? No, this is mine. I will always

209
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,440
Speaker 4:  control this part of the business.

210
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:03,550
Speaker 3:  Yeah. So we handle, you know, all the product development support,

211
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,240
Speaker 3:  and we've got our own dedicated teams for nearly every

212
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,110
Speaker 3:  function that runs the company in terms of how do we leverage

213
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,710
Speaker 3:  the greater Amazon? Well, there are a lot of it's relationships

214
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:18,610
Speaker 3:  pasty thinking about like long-term inventory

215
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,600
Speaker 3:  and really being able to make sure we have enough stock for

216
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,590
Speaker 3:  customers that has been places where we've leveraged the greater

217
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:30,580
Speaker 3:  team a lot. Then there's also strategic planning. You know, what sub

218
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,030
Speaker 3:  suppliers can we work to work with together

219
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:38,320
Speaker 3:  and really aggregate, you know, the demand of radios or

220
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,980
Speaker 3:  memory or other parts of the supply chain. So we

221
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,460
Speaker 3:  get, you know, better scale, better support and can

222
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,300
Speaker 3:  deliver better products for customers. So we've done a lot of that,

223
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,590
Speaker 3:  but yeah, we S Amazon's very much about single-threaded

224
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,610
Speaker 3:  ownership and, you know, that's my responsibility at eeros keep driving the

225
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,360
Speaker 3:  company, keep driving the product portfolio, keep building

226
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,400
Speaker 3:  great, great devices for customers.

227
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,940
Speaker 5:  We get on the phone with like the prime video team. And you're like, dude,

228
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,900
Speaker 5:  Ted lasso is just like constantly using an iPhone. Can we, can we

229
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,730
Speaker 5:  get the boys? Some Euro routers

230
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,170
Speaker 3:  Every station yet, but yeah,

231
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,960
Speaker 5:  That's my only suggestion. Okay. We're going to have more about thread, but

232
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,230
Speaker 5:  that,

233
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,800
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I guess I'll have to talk about getting stuff out to customers. Do

234
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,490
Speaker 4:  you have people who don't know, you don't just sell to like consumers on

235
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,850
Speaker 4:  Amazon, you've got like an ISP business. You're partnering with actual internet

236
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,410
Speaker 4:  service providers. How's that going?

237
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,400
Speaker 3:  Yeah, that's, that's been a huge part of our business. So over the last year,

238
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,670
Speaker 3:  our Eero networks that get deployed by our

239
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:43,450
Speaker 3:  ISP customers have increased over 75%.

240
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,560
Speaker 3:  And that's just because customers want faster speeds when they get

241
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,220
Speaker 3:  faster speeds, they want faster wifi and they want coverage everywhere.

242
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,150
Speaker 3:  So we've announced deals with TalkTalk in the

243
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,750
Speaker 3:  UK Mediacom here in, in New York. And

244
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:02,710
Speaker 3:  it's been really exciting taking, you know, really great internet connectivity

245
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,670
Speaker 3:  plans, bundling them with eeros and then delivering this

246
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,660
Speaker 3:  like great internet experience to customers like that is what we are

247
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,960
Speaker 3:  trying to do each and every day we want the internet and people's homes to

248
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,740
Speaker 3:  just work and, and working really closely with

249
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:21,070
Speaker 3:  internet service providers is, is a really big part of our business. Is that

250
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:21,550
Speaker 3:  going

251
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:24,220
Speaker 4:  To be a bigger part of your business than selling direct to consumers?

252
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:28,360
Speaker 3:  You know, over time, we'll see, you know, we, we sell a lot of

253
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:32,110
Speaker 3:  arrows on, you know, with retail partners, like best

254
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,640
Speaker 3:  buy Costco.

255
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,550
Speaker 5:  And then I mentioned the other ones before we really like an

256
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,970
Speaker 3:  Amazon on amazon.com, hulking Goliath

257
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:40,660
Speaker 5:  In the corner.

258
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,610
Speaker 3:  We also sell it on eero.com.

259
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,740
Speaker 5:  Actually. What do you think about, like, where is it growing? W I,

260
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:51,440
Speaker 5:  we are going to talk about threatened smart home, but when you can worse,

261
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,340
Speaker 5:  we've made you wait for the punishment. But when you think about, okay,

262
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,000
Speaker 5:  my cable company is going to put an ear on my house. Okay. Will companies

263
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,990
Speaker 5:  have historically weird ideas about configuration

264
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,920
Speaker 5:  and stuff like that? When you start to add the capabilities, are

265
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,580
Speaker 5:  they getting in your way? Will they get in my way, like, I want to turn on

266
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,390
Speaker 5:  thread, or I want to use some of the IRO features that you've deployed. Are

267
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,420
Speaker 5:  they leaving that stuff alone? Do you have to talk to them or you have to

268
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,050
Speaker 5:  negotiate? Like the classic example I would use is cell phones and carriers.

269
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:25,260
Speaker 5:  We have an entire exhibit to a cell phone that was destroyed by carriers.

270
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,070
Speaker 5:  The DDA made a documentary about like, is that something that's happening

271
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:28,610
Speaker 5:  to you too?

272
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,230
Speaker 3:  Eero devices across the globe, regardless of

273
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,800
Speaker 3:  where they were bought or where they're coming from, I'll run the exact same

274
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,430
Speaker 3:  software. They all talk to the same app. You have the same controls.

275
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:44,000
Speaker 3:  So for, for customers, if you get

276
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,840
Speaker 3:  your Eero from your local ISP, or you

277
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,380
Speaker 3:  buy it from eero.com, you're going to have the same, same

278
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,810
Speaker 3:  experience. And you're committed to that. You're never going to white label

279
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:57,650
Speaker 3:  it. You're never going to let ISP mess with it. We, we think

280
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:01,310
Speaker 3:  really tight integration between hardware software and delivering

281
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:05,150
Speaker 3:  that same experience works, works really well for customers. And

282
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:08,960
Speaker 3:  that that's how we've built the company, built the business,

283
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,310
Speaker 3:  and we're going to continue to do that.

284
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,780
Speaker 1:  Okay, we're going to take a quick break, but when we come back, we're going

285
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,060
Speaker 1:  to have a little bit more from the CEO of your own. Nick Weaver

286
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,700
Speaker 2:  Support for this episode comes from Sephora. Beauty is a story.

287
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,570
Speaker 2:  That's why support is shining a spotlight on the black creators and brand

288
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,470
Speaker 2:  founders whose contributions habits have shaped the industry. They help

289
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,830
Speaker 2:  us clean beauty for ourselves. Black beauty founders have been leading this

290
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,760
Speaker 2:  charge for decades. In fact, many of today's beauty trends,

Speaker 8:  Support for this episode comes from Tillamook, the clatter of

313
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,940
Speaker 8:  cutlery, warm conversation, over a lingering meal. The finest

314
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,840
Speaker 8:  flavors of each season food brings us together and creates community.

315
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:17,340
Speaker 8:  But where does that great food actually come from? It comes from farmland.

316
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:21,000
Speaker 8:  That's under threat. The U S lost 11 million acres of

317
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,660
Speaker 8:  farmland to development in the last 20 years. That's 2000

318
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,620
Speaker 8:  acres of fertile farmland, disappearing to development every single day.

319
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,850
Speaker 8:  And today's farmers are facing unprecedented challenges, the loss of life,

320
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,540
Speaker 9:  And is a big issue for farmers, but it's more than that. It's a

321
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:40,260
Speaker 9:  rapidly changing marketplace and trying to grow food

322
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,280
Speaker 9:  facing severe weather associated with climate change. It is hard and

323
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,360
Speaker 9:  risky being a farmer.

324
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,680
Speaker 8:  That's David Haidt, VP of programs with American farmland, trust an

325
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,640
Speaker 8:  organization, working to save farmland and support farmers. It's more

326
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,270
Speaker 8:  important than ever to protect the future of farming. The offer farmers

327
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,140
Speaker 8:  coalition, a partnership between Tillamook and American farmland trust is

328
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,040
Speaker 8:  working to help farmers find out more and what you can do to help at all.

329
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,510
Speaker 8:  For farmers.com.

330
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,570
Speaker 10:  It used to be hard to stay close to family until Facebook portal. We

331
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,750
Speaker 10:  went from rarely video chatting to seeing each other on portal. Almost every

332
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,440
Speaker 10:  day. Portal has cool features like smart camera that keeps up with the kids.

333
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,800
Speaker 10:  So they don't have to sit still, which is its own challenge.

334
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:27,180
Speaker 10:  Plus, the new portal go is portable so we can take it to the playroom or

335
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,390
Speaker 10:  the kitchen. The best feature is how close we all feel,

336
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,460
Speaker 10:  even though we're far apart,

337
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,720
Speaker 11:  Give the gift of a deeper connection. Facebook portal

338
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,070
Speaker 8:  Share something real.

339
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,690
Speaker 4:  All right. We're back with more of our interview from the, on the verge event

340
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,250
Speaker 4:  with the CEO of Eero Nick Weaver.

341
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,010
Speaker 4:  So I promised we were going to fix the smart home and it was not going to

342
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,400
Speaker 4:  be confusing anymore, but before we do, I want you to pull out your phone.

343
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,820
Speaker 4:  Sure. And we're going to look at our Aero networks. I want you to

344
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:03,900
Speaker 4:  avoid, and we are all going to find the most embarrassing

345
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,260
Speaker 4:  thing currently connected to our smart home. And we're going to cop to it

346
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,030
Speaker 4:  and explain why we have it. So this is <inaudible>

347
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,010
Speaker 4:  here. I knew this was coming. So I'll just tell you the most embarrassing

348
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,850
Speaker 4:  thing on my network is Lisa. That's my spouse mega, I don't know what mega

349
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,850
Speaker 4:  means. Smart plug question, mark. Question mark.

350
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,770
Speaker 4:  I don't know what it is. Neither does she, but we are too afraid to turn

351
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:29,520
Speaker 4:  it off because we think it controls something important. That's good.

352
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:33,360
Speaker 4:  Yeah. That's a, it's a 2.4 and it's made by a company

353
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,770
Speaker 4:  called expressive. That's

354
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,660
Speaker 4:  Maybe, maybe someone's someone's spying on me. Yeah, he got mine is

355
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,630
Speaker 4:  extremely dumb. It is also a plug. Okay. I know what it does.

356
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,470
Speaker 4:  It's turns the

357
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:51,370
Speaker 5:  Subwoofer and our living room off because often when we

358
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,880
Speaker 5:  are verge casting, my daughter max is watching pop

359
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,480
Speaker 5:  patrol and there are at least two episodes of our show

360
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:02,170
Speaker 5:  where you can hear the thump of the pop patrol themes

361
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:08,650
Speaker 5:  coming from right above us. So I put the subwoofer on a plug and I turn

362
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:12,550
Speaker 5:  it off before he podcasts. And I don't know why I turn it back

363
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:16,150
Speaker 5:  on it's cause like, she's not like, I don't know the base response to that.

364
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:24,310
Speaker 3:  I think for me, it's just like the long list of devices in the home category.

365
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,090
Speaker 3:  We have air quality sensors. We have air purifiers. Cause

366
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,540
Speaker 3:  we're in Northern California. I have

367
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,680
Speaker 3:  ceiling fans. I have the ceiling fan controller. We have

368
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,400
Speaker 3:  an oven and then we have a bunch of hubs I've been

369
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,270
Speaker 3:  trying out to see if they do anything. It's been,

370
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,170
Speaker 3:  it's been, been a lot, like a very long project. Do you

371
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,310
Speaker 5:  Have a, do you have a HomeKit bridge?

372
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,990
Speaker 3:  I do have a hoops.

373
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,490
Speaker 5:  Yeah. We have three of them. Three of them on stage. I feel like, but it's

374
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,520
Speaker 5:  weird. Like, you know, we're outside the system, you admitting that you have

375
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,650
Speaker 5:  a hoops box. It's like, all right, it's not

376
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,460
Speaker 3:  Maybe experimenting. It's it. It's, it's an interesting

377
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,950
Speaker 3:  experience. Very hard to configure

378
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,210
Speaker 5:  The hubs is it's a thing you can buy, but the actual software is called HomeBridge

379
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:14,500
Speaker 5:  and it is, it just bridges everything into home

380
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,770
Speaker 5:  kit. So you're like your ring cameras show up in home kit Dieter, and I have

381
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,770
Speaker 5:  very different experiences with it. I'm like, it's great. And was like, why

382
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,740
Speaker 5:  did you make me do this? You're a horrible monster to bad friend.

383
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,360
Speaker 5:  I think it's great. But I've like, we've heard like lots of apple engineers

384
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,050
Speaker 5:  have this thing running. And like, to me, that, that brings us right to where

385
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:35,680
Speaker 5:  we're going, which is that it's crazy that like a bunch of

386
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,610
Speaker 5:  Europeans like ship everybody raspberry pies to make their smart homes

387
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:42,730
Speaker 5:  work. But that is the current state of things you're working on. Fixing it.

388
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,570
Speaker 5:  How's it, how's it going?

389
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,620
Speaker 3:  Well, you know, our whole thesis bureau, why we started the

390
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,500
Speaker 3:  company, everything in our homes is going to be connected to the internet

391
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,520
Speaker 3:  and ultimately, or our homes are going to run on a computer.

392
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,420
Speaker 3:  And so our vision has always been, you need to have a network to

393
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,380
Speaker 3:  enable that and that computer and that network are probably going to

394
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,770
Speaker 3:  converge into the same thing, but there's a first really

395
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,910
Speaker 3:  important step. And that is having super fast, reliable

396
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:13,870
Speaker 3:  connectivity everywhere today. That's primarily wifi over

397
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:17,500
Speaker 3:  time. It's to continue to be, you know, you need low

398
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,430
Speaker 3:  power. You need long range. There's a bunch of different flavors of

399
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:25,420
Speaker 3:  connectivity that this home of the future needs. And actually the home

400
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:29,350
Speaker 3:  of today needs to, to get all these devices connected. And

401
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:32,980
Speaker 3:  once they're connected and it's as reliable as our running water and our

402
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,460
Speaker 3:  power, then you can start layering on control

403
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:40,540
Speaker 3:  intelligence and you know, all the other things that we are

404
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,860
Speaker 3:  trying to make happen today.

405
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,500
Speaker 5:  There's two big things happening. One there's this industry group

406
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,070
Speaker 4:  Called matter, which is apple, Google, Amazon, and

407
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,050
Speaker 4:  formerly choice.

408
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,160
Speaker 5:  My, my t-shirt that says we matter raises a lot of questions,

409
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,210
Speaker 5:  right? It's a great,

410
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,620
Speaker 4:  It's a connected home over IP. The idea is that gadget should have like simpler,

411
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,890
Speaker 4:  easier networking. There works more like, like over IP. So that's like

412
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,880
Speaker 4:  one thing that's happening and you're involved in that. But then the other

413
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,970
Speaker 4:  thing is there's like the radio called thread,

414
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,870
Speaker 4:  which you have been promising is going to matter

415
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,320
Speaker 4:  and, and be a big deal for quite a while.

416
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,250
Speaker 5:  The first day I met you like next, he was like a startup founder and he's

417
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,820
Speaker 5:  like, I made this great router. And like, we had great conversations like

418
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:29,600
Speaker 5:  early on, like we love startups and we're like, what is this

419
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,930
Speaker 5:  radio? And he was like, this is going to be a big deal. And that was in

420
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,670
Speaker 5:  2017. Yes.

421
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,470
Speaker 3:  June of 2017.

422
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:40,130
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You're like, you're got it. And like the, it was apples and the support

423
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:43,910
Speaker 5:  it and Google's, and they kind of are now, but it's still in its infancy.

424
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:47,660
Speaker 5:  So why did it, why that dip and is it going to happen?

425
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:52,010
Speaker 3:  You know, what's interesting about thread, so it's a 15 dot four radio.

426
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,940
Speaker 3:  And what it does is it acts very much like

427
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,630
Speaker 3:  wifi just says, Hey, I'm going to let, I'm going to create a

428
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:03,560
Speaker 3:  network. I'm going to let devices connect to it. We're going to talk IP what

429
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,370
Speaker 3:  you send packets. And I'm just going to get out of the way. It's

430
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,760
Speaker 3:  really simple, like wifi, but it's built for low power

431
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,720
Speaker 3:  devices. It's got great range. Great on in

432
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,440
Speaker 3:  terms of reliability. And then, you know, it can, it can mesh so you can

433
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,320
Speaker 3:  easily extend coverage throughout the network.

434
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,530
Speaker 4:  It's wonderful. It's great. Are there any gadgets that I could connect to

435
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,400
Speaker 4:  this wonderful network?

436
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,330
Speaker 5:  No, I think, I think

437
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:28,790
Speaker 5:  my lights come on

438
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,200
Speaker 3:  With, with matter. There's a shot that all of this comes together.

439
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,740
Speaker 3:  There's just, there's so many different ecosystems. There's Z-Wave wave there's.

440
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:41,240
Speaker 5:  Have you ever been to the Z-Wave Alliance building? I haven't. Okay. If

441
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,390
Speaker 5:  anyone knows what that building is shaped like a Z, please let me know. Like,

442
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,120
Speaker 5:  if your organization is called the Z-Wave Alliance and you don't find a Z

443
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,180
Speaker 5:  shaped building to be in, like, you're not going to succeed. Okay.

444
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,970
Speaker 4:  Generally the question is like what what's taking so long for thread. If

445
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,790
Speaker 4:  it's such a great technology, what's taken so long. We, we, we are living

446
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:59,660
Speaker 4:  in this incredibly fragmented smart home world thread seems like a good one,

447
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,970
Speaker 4:  potentially good solution, but there's too many standards. We've gotta make

448
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,380
Speaker 4:  a new standard. Why isn't,

449
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,820
Speaker 3:  It's just these things just take off. They take a long time. All right. Imagine

450
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,180
Speaker 3:  for us, for a lot of people in this room, like we've been doing connected

451
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:14,660
Speaker 3:  home things for a very long time. When you look at

452
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,560
Speaker 3:  just the average customer, that stuff is

453
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,430
Speaker 3:  still, it's just starting. And now that there's,

454
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:25,910
Speaker 3:  you know, voice control layers that make things easier to

455
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:29,480
Speaker 3:  control, you don't have to do a bunch of custom programming on a home

456
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,380
Speaker 3:  automation system. We're just, we're, we're starting to get there. And

457
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:37,370
Speaker 3:  then it's the chicken or the egg problem. Like you have to have

458
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:40,970
Speaker 3:  enough base station support for it so that devices can connect.

459
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:44,820
Speaker 3:  And then you also need enough devices to move everything together.

460
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,570
Speaker 3:  And that,

461
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,390
Speaker 5:  I love it. Let me, I'll push you there. Like I've got a bunch of heroes in

462
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:52,320
Speaker 5:  my house. Yep. They support thread. I can turn them on. Apple is in

463
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,920
Speaker 5:  the thread. The home pod mini is a thread router,

464
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,820
Speaker 5:  but they won't talk to each other yet. Right? Like the arrows are not

465
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,510
Speaker 5:  HomeKit compatible. And then if I want to add a handful of

466
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:07,470
Speaker 5:  thread devices, they actually still need a home pod mini or an apple TV.

467
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,200
Speaker 5:  And they won't talk to the like, how are you solving that? Are you going

468
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,380
Speaker 5:  to talk to apple or give me home kit? Was that something apple needs to do?

469
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:16,800
Speaker 3:  I think that that's where matter starts to become interesting. You're going

470
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,760
Speaker 3:  to have these profiles for all the different devices. It's independent of

471
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,930
Speaker 3:  how the devices are connecting. We have the Eero pro six, the

472
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:28,890
Speaker 3:  six, the Eero pro and the Eero beacon are all thread, border routers. You

473
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:32,880
Speaker 3:  can turn that on today. I've got nano leaf bulbs that connect

474
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:33,570
Speaker 3:  via threat.

475
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,860
Speaker 5:  I love it. Like network. What's the first nerd product we

476
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,980
Speaker 5:  should do. It's like gamer lights. Yes. And like everybody has them.

477
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:45,270
Speaker 3:  So I, I think it, it, it is, it's been slower

478
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:48,900
Speaker 3:  than I certainly would have liked, but it feels like it is gaining

479
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,810
Speaker 3:  momentum and starting to finally move in the right dress.

480
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:55,680
Speaker 5:  So you're kind of in the middle of it. Do you see the, and I recognize that

481
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:59,760
Speaker 5:  this is what matters is supposed to solve, but I see apple saying, we

482
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,660
Speaker 5:  still kind of want our system to win. And Google wants

483
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,530
Speaker 5:  that. And Amazon obviously wants that and the incentives are

484
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:11,130
Speaker 5:  not aligned, right? Like if you buy everything, that's Alexa

485
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:14,940
Speaker 5:  compatible. That's probably better for Amazon that if everything works with

486
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,600
Speaker 5:  all three systems and you can mix and match, how, how do you align those

487
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,220
Speaker 5:  incentives and how do you manage it in the middle?

488
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,490
Speaker 3:  So, so era devices, they're going to support matter of her threat, that

489
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:28,110
Speaker 3:  that is something we are doing. And we're really, we're excited about

490
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:31,980
Speaker 3:  that. And personally, I think customers, when, when the devices

491
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,670
Speaker 3:  work with however they want to control them. And so

492
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:39,600
Speaker 3:  that's what we are trying to enable, trying to make sure any device can connect

493
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,230
Speaker 3:  to our network and communicate wherever it needs to just talks

494
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:47,130
Speaker 3:  IP, just like all their wifi devices do today. Okay. A few

495
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:47,520
Speaker 3:  more questions,

496
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,520
Speaker 4:  But if y'all have questions about how to configure your network, please don't

497
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,150
Speaker 4:  come to the mix because

498
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,050
Speaker 4:  there's Mike's side of the room. And so you can symbolize

499
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:58,920
Speaker 5:  And plug it right back in. That is,

500
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:03,120
Speaker 5:  well, actually the first time we talked, Nick told me that he got the idea

501
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,020
Speaker 5:  for Eero because he'd put his parents a wifi

502
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,980
Speaker 5:  set up on a power strip and he had like a fix it button that just

503
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,880
Speaker 5:  turned the powers trip.

504
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:16,470
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Internet reset, button, power, strip, big red button.

505
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:20,490
Speaker 3:  And you could hit that. And then a V1 of automation was

506
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:24,600
Speaker 3:  you got one of those old school rotary timers. And then just once a

507
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,560
Speaker 3:  day, you know, it hits like 2:02 AM and just

508
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,640
Speaker 3:  power cycles. The whole thing

509
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:33,660
Speaker 5:  There is, remember the Cabo. I always know that an

510
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:37,620
Speaker 5:  Android based product is like gonna run into some troubles when

511
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:41,100
Speaker 5:  it has like a built-in restart feature. That's like, just, I'm gonna reset

512
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,540
Speaker 5:  up right now. It's that good? All right.

513
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:47,440
Speaker 4:  So what's next for thread with hero? Like you say, you're gonna support matter.

514
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,360
Speaker 4:  Is there anything else you're doing anything else you're gonna put

515
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,560
Speaker 3:  For us right now? It's just, how do we get as much coverage thread

516
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,130
Speaker 3:  coverage out there as possible? You know, our devices support

517
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:01,360
Speaker 3:  ZigBee thread, Bluetooth, and obviously wifi. And

518
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:05,320
Speaker 3:  we're, we're just trying to add as many arrows out there

519
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,920
Speaker 3:  as possible so that we can have that low power coverage

520
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:12,970
Speaker 3:  that customers are going to need. They don't need already. So next year

521
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,570
Speaker 3:  matter is going to matter. You think, I think it's, everything is

522
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:20,410
Speaker 3:  trending in the right direction. We were a little early in 2017. I don't

523
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:24,400
Speaker 3:  want to be that early again, but it, it does. It

524
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,120
Speaker 3:  does feel different this time. It feels like, you know, there's, there's

525
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,630
Speaker 3:  just a lot of momentum device manufacturers are starting to

526
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:35,920
Speaker 3:  really reevaluate their roadmaps. And also the, the Silicon out

527
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,640
Speaker 3:  there supports all this stuff natively. So it can support

528
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:43,540
Speaker 3:  ZigBee or can support thread or can support Bluetooth. Right. All on the

529
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,050
Speaker 3:  same chip. So people aren't going to need. So it's just a, you know, a software

530
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:51,040
Speaker 3:  setting. So we finally are starting to get the infrastructure down to the

531
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,900
Speaker 3:  Silicon level to make all this stuff happen. Right.

532
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:58,540
Speaker 5:  Told me you read the subreddit, you admitted this to me backstage, the band

533
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:02,080
Speaker 5:  wakes up the CEO and then reads the subreddit, which is just

534
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,080
Speaker 3:  Masochistic. But I appreciate your section is real. Yeah.

535
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,800
Speaker 5:  I know that subreddit wants to know if you're going to support home kitten

536
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,910
Speaker 5:  thread. Are you going to do it?

537
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:13,360
Speaker 3:  We are doing everything we can to support thread

538
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,140
Speaker 3:  how HomeKit fits into it. Like we're just going to have to

539
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:21,070
Speaker 3:  see how that evolves here over the next little bit. Not correct.

540
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:25,960
Speaker 12:  Hey, so huge fan. I went from an airport

541
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,440
Speaker 12:  to an IRO and I feel like that's probably a pretty common path for a lot

542
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,310
Speaker 12:  of people in this room. Your first generation of products is now

543
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:37,150
Speaker 12:  probably about five years old. And as other companies have had to

544
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:40,900
Speaker 12:  deal with recently life cycling and supporting them over the over

545
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,740
Speaker 12:  time of computers, living in your home that are really, really critical

546
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:48,460
Speaker 12:  to your experience. There is going to be a real

547
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:52,390
Speaker 12:  challenge. What is your strategy for, you know, keeping

548
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:54,130
Speaker 12:  those things useful for as long as possible?

549
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,870
Speaker 3:  Well, that is our strategy. We are, we are trying to keep the

550
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:02,770
Speaker 3:  products as a safe, secure, and

551
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:06,490
Speaker 3:  reliable as possible for as long as we feasibly can. And

552
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:10,300
Speaker 3:  so that means continuing to, you know, run regression

553
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:14,260
Speaker 3:  tests on, on all of our first-generation, eeros

554
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:18,130
Speaker 3:  standing behind them. If customers are having problems, part of that

555
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:22,000
Speaker 3:  too, like we do want to encourage customers to upgrade over

556
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,540
Speaker 3:  the, over the years to get faster speeds, more

557
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,600
Speaker 3:  reliability, frankly, we've gotten a lot better at

558
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,530
Speaker 3:  building these products as we've learned over the last

559
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:36,730
Speaker 3:  seven, almost eight years. But you know, again, our, our

560
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:40,640
Speaker 3:  primary goal is just keep delivering great internet experience

561
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:44,500
Speaker 3:  to our earliest supporters. And, and, and

562
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:48,260
Speaker 3:  most importantly, keeping the devices secure because

563
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,460
Speaker 3:  running the network is it's a lot of responsibility. We take that really

564
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:52,940
Speaker 3:  seriously.

565
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,900
Speaker 4:  You have a number in mind in terms of years, we're like, okay, no more. We

566
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,800
Speaker 4:  can't support this anymore.

567
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,850
Speaker 3:  We're going to try to support them as long as we, as long as we possibly

568
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:05,840
Speaker 3:  can. You know, we do run into practical limits. If a wifi

569
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,620
Speaker 3:  router is running more than five to seven years, it's not going to

570
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:13,340
Speaker 3:  perform the same way a new device will. You're going to

571
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,330
Speaker 3:  just, it'll slowly start degrading just because

572
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:21,050
Speaker 3:  the duty cycle on these things is they're on 24 hours a day,

573
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:25,190
Speaker 3:  seven days a week, and they're always sending packets. So it

574
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:28,220
Speaker 3:  is something you should, you don't need to upgrade your network every year

575
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:31,610
Speaker 3:  or even every two years, but it is something you should think about upgrading

576
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,460
Speaker 3:  every three to five to six years,

577
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:37,760
Speaker 3:  because it's one of the most important devices in our home.

578
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,940
Speaker 4:  We've got time for one, maybe two more of a please keep it quick.

579
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,240
Speaker 13:  Let's see. All right. So I got a smart home question for you. So we have

580
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:47,900
Speaker 13:  Z-Wave, which has obviously been around for quite a while, and it has that

581
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,440
Speaker 13:  standardized protocol and radio layer. So where

582
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,250
Speaker 13:  does thread and matter succeed where Z-Wave does it, like what

583
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,760
Speaker 13:  went wrong with Z-Wave because it is ubiquitous, there's lots of

584
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,150
Speaker 13:  devices, but we don't really see it dominating the smart home will I spend

585
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,720
Speaker 4:  And a building shaped like a Z? Yeah, that might be it. So

586
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:10,220
Speaker 3:  I think part of it is really separating the profile,

587
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:13,940
Speaker 3:  the device and the connectivity layer. So it's removing like

588
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:17,780
Speaker 3:  profiles and not having specific profiles for each

589
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:21,740
Speaker 3:  device. So what threads really trying to do is separate

590
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:25,640
Speaker 3:  that out where any device can connect to the network, send packets,

591
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:29,750
Speaker 3:  it can then use a matter profile if it wants to, it can extend

592
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,470
Speaker 3:  a matter profile or it can, you know, use whatever

593
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:37,280
Speaker 3:  application layer makes sense for that device. So it's really about

594
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:41,270
Speaker 3:  separating things and making it easier for device manufacturers

595
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:45,230
Speaker 3:  to build devices, deploy them and leverage,

596
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:49,070
Speaker 3:  you know, that means of connectivity. Another thing is it's

597
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:52,820
Speaker 3:  about the like RF usage within the device. And so what's

598
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,330
Speaker 3:  great about 15 four is it's running and 2.4

599
00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:00,020
Speaker 3:  gigahertz. So it just, it reduces the amount of RF you have to deal

600
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,980
Speaker 3:  with in the, you know, in the router, you know, for us so that,

601
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,650
Speaker 3:  you know, you're not having to deal with all these different frequencies

602
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,820
Speaker 3:  and paying that like per chip cost in three or four

603
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:14,540
Speaker 3:  or five units or however many units you have on your Eero

604
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:14,960
Speaker 3:  network.

605
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,440
Speaker 4:  Well, I think on that incredibly nerdy answer, that's a perfect place to

606
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,670
Speaker 4:  end talking about routers. So everybody Nick Weaver. Yeah. Thanks. That's

607
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:21,860
Speaker 4:  great.

608
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,230
Speaker 1:  All right. My thanks to Nick Weaver for coming on the verge cast, talking

609
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:34,070
Speaker 1:  to us about Eero and thread in the future of the smart home and my thanks

610
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:37,980
Speaker 1:  to you for listening to this episode. And you know what, it's been an instance

611
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,460
Speaker 1:  we've asked her this, if you could head over to, you know, it's apple podcasts,

612
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,670
Speaker 1:  that's the place to do reviews, go over there and give us a review and rating

613
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,120
Speaker 1:  really appreciate that. It really does help to show out this week search
