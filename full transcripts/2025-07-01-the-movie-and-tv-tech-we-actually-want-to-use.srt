Description: One way to think about the tech industry is just as a series of people trying to build stuff they saw in movies and on TV. Some of that tech is great, some of it is deeply dystopian, and most of it would make the world a very different place if it suddenly existed. In this episode, a bunch of us try to figure out which tech we actually want to use. David is joined by The Verge’s Allison Johnson, Jennifer Pattison-Tuohy, Mia Sato, and Victoria Song — aka the hosts of Hot Girl Vergecast Summer — to draft their way through the movie, show, and game tech they’d want to make real. Some of the picks you’ll expect, and some we bet has never crossed your mind. And some big-name tech goes undrafted!

Once you've finished the show, make sure you take the poll and tell us who won: https://forms.gle/Q1wFhpzCdM3B5bqj9

00:00:03,185 --> 00:00:07,115
Speaker 2:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of flying cars that

3
00:00:07,115 --> 00:00:10,075
Speaker 2:  you will never fly. I'm m your friend David Pierce, and if you're seeing

4
00:00:10,075 --> 00:00:13,635
Speaker 2:  this or hearing it, it means I'm already dead. No, I'm just kidding. It just

5
00:00:13,635 --> 00:00:16,555
Speaker 2:  means I'm out on parental leave. I'm gonna be gone through the rest of the

6
00:00:16,555 --> 00:00:20,235
Speaker 2:  summer. Neli Patel, my co-host is going to be gone probably

7
00:00:20,435 --> 00:00:23,555
Speaker 2:  sometime after me, but he's gonna be gone for the summer too. We're gonna

8
00:00:23,555 --> 00:00:26,635
Speaker 2:  be back this fall and we're going to be so excited to hang out with all of

9
00:00:26,635 --> 00:00:30,595
Speaker 2:  you and talk tech again after talking about just baby stuff for

10
00:00:30,595 --> 00:00:33,635
Speaker 2:  months. We're very excited. But in the meantime, you are in exceptionally

11
00:00:33,635 --> 00:00:36,835
Speaker 2:  good hands. Jake Kakis on our team is going to be taking over the Friday

12
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:40,755
Speaker 2:  show for the summer, and we have four guest hosts who are going to

13
00:00:40,755 --> 00:00:44,115
Speaker 2:  be with you all summer on the Tuesday show. And they are also my four guests

14
00:00:44,285 --> 00:00:48,275
Speaker 2:  today V Song Allison Johnson. Jen Tuey and Mia Sato

15
00:00:48,295 --> 00:00:51,555
Speaker 2:  are going to be hosting the show. And they have some big ideas about all

16
00:00:51,555 --> 00:00:53,355
Speaker 2:  the different kinds of stories that they're gonna tell you. They've been

17
00:00:53,355 --> 00:00:56,555
Speaker 2:  working on some really fun stuff. We're gonna have some stuff about all whatever

18
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:59,875
Speaker 2:  chaotic news happens this summer, they're gonna have a blast, And I think

19
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:03,435
Speaker 2:  you're gonna have a blast. So I invited the four of them for my last episode

20
00:01:03,435 --> 00:01:06,875
Speaker 2:  here this summer to come with me and do something I've been wanting to do

21
00:01:06,975 --> 00:01:10,875
Speaker 2:  for a long time, which is look through the Annals of movies and

22
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:14,635
Speaker 2:  TV shows and all of the technology and all of them, and try to decide

23
00:01:14,745 --> 00:01:18,635
Speaker 2:  what we would actually want in our life. So we're gonna do a bit of

24
00:01:18,635 --> 00:01:22,395
Speaker 2:  a draft today, the five of us. We're going to pick five things each, and

25
00:01:22,395 --> 00:01:25,275
Speaker 2:  it's going to be chaos. And we're gonna try to figure out what fictional

26
00:01:25,275 --> 00:01:29,035
Speaker 2:  tech do we want in our real lives. All that is coming up in just a sec, but

27
00:01:29,035 --> 00:01:32,955
Speaker 2:  first we gotta take a quick break because presumably I gotta go to some

28
00:01:32,955 --> 00:01:35,835
Speaker 2:  kids stuff. I don't know. This is The Vergecast, we'll be right back

29
00:03:37,905 --> 00:03:41,585
Speaker 2:  you are going to just absolutely run me out of a job And I literally could

30
00:03:41,585 --> 00:03:44,825
Speaker 2:  not be more excited about it in the order in which I see you. Allison Johnson's

31
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:48,785
Speaker 2:  here. Hi Allison. Hello, Jen Tuey also here with very cool lights

32
00:03:48,785 --> 00:03:50,745
Speaker 2:  in the background. Hi, Jen. Always,

33
00:03:50,745 --> 00:03:52,105
Speaker 7:  Always cool stuff in my house.

34
00:03:53,405 --> 00:03:56,905
Speaker 2:  Hi David. The song, I believe in a phone booth in our office.

35
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:01,505
Speaker 8:  Hell yeah. And I brought my podcast Mike with me to the office. So

36
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:02,705
Speaker 8:  that's dedication.

37
00:04:02,815 --> 00:04:06,265
Speaker 2:  Nothing more fun than a long podcast than a phone booth. This is gonna be

38
00:04:06,265 --> 00:04:10,105
Speaker 2:  great. Miyazato is also here. Hi Mia. Hello. You

39
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:14,065
Speaker 2:  got the most Tuohy podcast setup of all of us, so

40
00:04:14,065 --> 00:04:14,985
Speaker 2:  congratulations. Oh

41
00:04:14,985 --> 00:04:18,585
Speaker 7:  My God, you're lucky I don't have my like AirPod mic, you know what I mean?

42
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:22,145
Speaker 7:  Or the new thing that they're doing. They're clipping like a road mic onto

43
00:04:22,385 --> 00:04:25,305
Speaker 7:  a tube of lip gloss and then holding the lip gloss. I actually should have

44
00:04:25,305 --> 00:04:25,505
Speaker 7:  done that.

45
00:04:25,825 --> 00:04:28,345
Speaker 2:  You should have done that. There was a real, we, like, honest to God had

46
00:04:28,385 --> 00:04:31,825
Speaker 2:  a conversation about like, what if all of David's recordings for The Verge

47
00:04:31,825 --> 00:04:35,385
Speaker 2:  cast were with the tiny little lavalier mic? So good. And I just couldn't

48
00:04:35,385 --> 00:04:38,345
Speaker 2:  do it. I'm, I'm, I'm 20 years too old to be able to pull that off.

49
00:04:39,785 --> 00:04:43,465
Speaker 2:  Okay, so here is how this draft is going to work. The concept

50
00:04:43,725 --> 00:04:47,465
Speaker 2:  is, is essentially things that are in movies, TV

51
00:04:47,465 --> 00:04:51,385
Speaker 2:  shows, And I believe we said yes to video games that we would like to lift

52
00:04:51,485 --> 00:04:55,025
Speaker 2:  out of those things and place in the real world. And I think the way I've

53
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:58,985
Speaker 2:  come to see it is it's like, it's not just one that's for you, but it's also

54
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:02,905
Speaker 2:  not like everyone on earth has it. It's at like, I would say like

55
00:05:03,205 --> 00:05:06,345
Speaker 2:  Mac Pro levels of adoption, right? Where like if you see one, you're not

56
00:05:06,345 --> 00:05:09,985
Speaker 2:  like, oh, weird, I've never seen that before. But you also like, don't assume

57
00:05:09,985 --> 00:05:13,505
Speaker 2:  that everyone you've ever met has one. Does that make sense? Okay. Price

58
00:05:13,505 --> 00:05:16,305
Speaker 2:  is no object and none of these things cost anything in these movies anyway.

59
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:19,665
Speaker 2:  So they're just, it's just we're taking it out and putting it into our real

60
00:05:19,665 --> 00:05:23,385
Speaker 2:  lives. There are only, I would say, three rules

61
00:05:23,655 --> 00:05:27,505
Speaker 2:  that I have for you. One is no weapons, which is just like, don't,

62
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:31,385
Speaker 2:  don't be weird. We don't need that energy here. Thing number two is

63
00:05:31,385 --> 00:05:35,185
Speaker 2:  you can't draft a concept. So you can't like draft time

64
00:05:35,185 --> 00:05:38,905
Speaker 2:  travel or like, I don't know, cure all

65
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,865
Speaker 2:  diseases. It's like not, you just can't, you can't have that, even though

66
00:05:41,865 --> 00:05:43,705
Speaker 2:  that is like a thing that exists in the fiction of some of these things.

67
00:05:44,265 --> 00:05:47,465
Speaker 2:  If there is a gadget through which you can time travel, knock yourself out,

68
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:51,265
Speaker 2:  but you can't just have the concept of time travel. And the

69
00:05:51,265 --> 00:05:54,745
Speaker 2:  third thing is a rule that we just decided on earlier today, which is

70
00:05:55,025 --> 00:05:57,845
Speaker 2:  you're not allowed to try and make the world a better place. I was looking

71
00:05:57,845 --> 00:05:59,125
Speaker 2:  through and the the

72
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,405
Speaker 9:  Reason, and none of us had thought about doing that tools.

73
00:06:01,765 --> 00:06:02,445
Speaker 8:  No, not at all,

74
00:06:02,535 --> 00:06:05,605
Speaker 2:  Which I love very much. But the, the reason this came up is I was looking

75
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:09,405
Speaker 2:  through a bunch of stuff to make my own list for this draft. And there's

76
00:06:09,405 --> 00:06:13,365
Speaker 2:  this thing in the movie Elysium, which I have never seen called the Med Bay,

77
00:06:13,725 --> 00:06:17,605
Speaker 2:  I believe. And it's thing is it can diagnose and cure like all diseases

78
00:06:17,605 --> 00:06:20,085
Speaker 2:  ever in history. And I immediately had this moment of being like, oh, well

79
00:06:20,085 --> 00:06:22,005
Speaker 2:  I should draft this 'cause that's great, wouldn't it be good? And then I

80
00:06:22,005 --> 00:06:25,125
Speaker 2:  was like, that's stupid and boring. So you're not allowed, you are not allowed

81
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:28,165
Speaker 2:  to make the world a better place. And if that is your argument, you'll be,

82
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:32,085
Speaker 2:  you will be summarily rejected from your draft. We're gonna do five

83
00:06:32,105 --> 00:06:35,925
Speaker 2:  rounds. So we're each gonna pick five things, 25 things in total, which is

84
00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:39,525
Speaker 2:  actually kind of a large number. And we're gonna do it in sort of snake draft

85
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:42,085
Speaker 2:  order. So if you draft last at the end of the first round, you will then

86
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:45,165
Speaker 2:  immediately draft again to start the second round. And we just go back and

87
00:06:45,165 --> 00:06:48,965
Speaker 2:  forth. That's basically it. Any questions before we go? Anything? I

88
00:06:48,965 --> 00:06:50,725
Speaker 2:  forgot. Everybody feel good? Ready to go?

89
00:06:51,105 --> 00:06:51,725
Speaker 9:  How do we win?

90
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:56,725
Speaker 2:  Oh, terrific point. When this show goes live,

91
00:06:56,825 --> 00:06:59,565
Speaker 2:  we will, we will have a post on The Verge dot com

92
00:07:00,835 --> 00:07:04,365
Speaker 2:  with all of our picks laid out and we'll do some kind of poll.

93
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:08,565
Speaker 2:  And I don't know if the verges, we use WordPress. Maybe

94
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:11,445
Speaker 2:  WordPress lets us do a poll and I'll be the first person to do that on the

95
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:14,565
Speaker 2:  verse.com. Maybe we'll figure out some other way to do it. But we will do

96
00:07:14,565 --> 00:07:15,925
Speaker 2:  a poll and whoever wins,

97
00:07:17,475 --> 00:07:19,995
Speaker 2:  I don know, I'll send you a Mac Pro. I won't, I won't do that, but a pro,

98
00:07:19,995 --> 00:07:20,435
Speaker 2:  we'll do something.

99
00:07:20,455 --> 00:07:23,875
Speaker 8:  Mac, Mac Pro. You heard it here, ladies Mac Pro,

100
00:07:24,365 --> 00:07:28,155
Speaker 8:  David Pierce, Mac Pro. Now he's not specified the year of Mac,

101
00:07:28,565 --> 00:07:30,715
Speaker 8:  which which is the little loophole.

102
00:07:30,975 --> 00:07:33,195
Speaker 2:  I'm gonna send you a trash can and you're gonna love

103
00:07:33,195 --> 00:07:33,315
Speaker 8:  It.

104
00:07:35,345 --> 00:07:38,365
Speaker 2:  Okay, so gen two E first overall pick.

105
00:07:42,235 --> 00:07:45,805
Speaker 9:  Okay, I know what I'm gonna start with going to my roots here in case

106
00:07:45,905 --> 00:07:49,645
Speaker 9:  anyone can't tell I'm English, So I'm going with the

107
00:07:49,765 --> 00:07:51,045
Speaker 9:  TARDIS from Dr. Who. Ah,

108
00:07:52,035 --> 00:07:53,445
Speaker 8:  Yeah, very good, very good.

109
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:56,525
Speaker 6:  It's called the Tards. They

110
00:07:56,525 --> 00:07:58,485
Speaker 10:  Can travel anywhere in time and space

111
00:08:00,985 --> 00:08:01,725
Speaker 6:  And it's mine

112
00:08:03,385 --> 00:08:06,565
Speaker 9:  As a kid actually is probably the first piece of tech I remember.

113
00:08:07,585 --> 00:08:11,365
Speaker 9:  And just loving that and the Dex, but I'm not gonna choose a

114
00:08:11,545 --> 00:08:11,765
Speaker 9:  dx.

115
00:08:12,145 --> 00:08:15,005
Speaker 2:  So can you explain for people who have not watched Dr. Who what, what is

116
00:08:15,005 --> 00:08:16,005
Speaker 2:  the tardis and why'd you pick it?

117
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:19,845
Speaker 9:  Okay, so the TARDIS is the time and relative dimension in

118
00:08:19,895 --> 00:08:23,605
Speaker 9:  space vehicle from the show. Dr.

119
00:08:23,745 --> 00:08:27,445
Speaker 9:  Who long running show older than me

120
00:08:27,585 --> 00:08:31,485
Speaker 9:  had recent revival, which I haven't actually watched much of. But what

121
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:35,485
Speaker 9:  I, the reason I would like the TARDIS is because you can travel across

122
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:39,725
Speaker 9:  space and time and fabrics and all the kind of cool

123
00:08:39,855 --> 00:08:43,445
Speaker 9:  space sci-fi. I mean it's just the

124
00:08:43,765 --> 00:08:47,605
Speaker 9:  coolest device, transportation device you could possibly

125
00:08:47,605 --> 00:08:51,445
Speaker 9:  have. And it is like as

126
00:08:51,445 --> 00:08:55,165
Speaker 9:  large as you want it to be, but it is also a telephone booth, which

127
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:58,165
Speaker 9:  is just the best concept in the world. Right? So the other thing I thought

128
00:08:58,165 --> 00:09:00,965
Speaker 9:  about picking, and if I'd lost this one, I would've gone for, would've been

129
00:09:00,965 --> 00:09:04,805
Speaker 9:  the Bill and Ted's telephone booth that travels through time. Oh, but

130
00:09:04,805 --> 00:09:06,325
Speaker 9:  the TARDIS is way cooler.

131
00:09:07,405 --> 00:09:08,405
Speaker 2:  I I agree. The

132
00:09:08,525 --> 00:09:09,925
Speaker 8:  TARDIS is a home too. It is.

133
00:09:09,985 --> 00:09:13,525
Speaker 9:  You can live in it. You go wherever you like in it. It's a translation

134
00:09:13,525 --> 00:09:17,445
Speaker 9:  machine. It's like, it is all the tech that you

135
00:09:17,445 --> 00:09:20,405
Speaker 9:  could possibly need packed into a telephone booth.

136
00:09:21,135 --> 00:09:24,405
Speaker 2:  There are a few of these in this draft that are just kind of cheating because

137
00:09:24,405 --> 00:09:26,965
Speaker 2:  it's like, oh, I get to draft this and then I have everything that has ever

138
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:30,005
Speaker 2:  existed for everyone ever. It's gonna be great. My question is, where where

139
00:09:30,005 --> 00:09:32,885
Speaker 2:  would you go? You you're, you get in the tart the first time, what do you

140
00:09:32,885 --> 00:09:32,965
Speaker 2:  do

141
00:09:33,745 --> 00:09:37,325
Speaker 9:  The first time I would go, well you see, I love history. So

142
00:09:37,615 --> 00:09:41,565
Speaker 9:  going back in time is my kind of, and that those episodes were

143
00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:44,005
Speaker 9:  always the fun ones. I don dunno if they do that so much in the new series,

144
00:09:44,065 --> 00:09:47,485
Speaker 9:  but in the old series they, that was always the fun stuff. And I'm a huge

145
00:09:48,035 --> 00:09:51,965
Speaker 9:  Elizabethan history nerd tutor and all that kind of stuff. So I would go

146
00:09:51,965 --> 00:09:55,885
Speaker 9:  back into T history and find out all such of cool stuff

147
00:09:55,885 --> 00:09:59,685
Speaker 9:  that I desperately would love to know the real story about, rather than having

148
00:09:59,685 --> 00:10:01,965
Speaker 9:  to piece through historical books and figure

149
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:04,765
Speaker 2:  That was when everybody was beheading everybody. Yeah, it was when

150
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:05,365
Speaker 8:  It was killing

151
00:10:05,435 --> 00:10:07,765
Speaker 9:  Each other. Yeah, it was really interesting times.

152
00:10:09,965 --> 00:10:12,005
Speaker 2:  I like this for you. All right, v what's your first pick?

153
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,205
Speaker 8:  My first pick is capsules from Dragon Ball Z.

154
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:19,125
Speaker 11:  No need to live outside like Savages. I have my Dino caps. Remember

155
00:10:19,725 --> 00:10:23,365
Speaker 12:  I don't like those magic witch bombs. Grandpa said never to use magic unless

156
00:10:23,365 --> 00:10:25,125
Speaker 12:  it's to help someone. Oh well I

157
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,485
Speaker 11:  Am going to help someone silly.

158
00:10:28,755 --> 00:10:29,325
Speaker 11:  Here it goes.

159
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,125
Speaker 11:  There we go. Now doesn't that look

160
00:10:38,275 --> 00:10:42,085
Speaker 8:  Cozy? They are. Listen, okay. They are genius

161
00:10:42,085 --> 00:10:46,045
Speaker 8:  invention and like Tardis, they are bigger on the inside than the outside.

162
00:10:46,365 --> 00:10:47,205
Speaker 8:  So if you've never watched a,

163
00:10:47,205 --> 00:10:48,005
Speaker 9:  That is the coolest thing.

164
00:10:48,745 --> 00:10:51,965
Speaker 8:  If you've never watched Dragon Ballsy, they're these tiny little capsules

165
00:10:51,965 --> 00:10:55,765
Speaker 8:  and that's like what Alma's family is actually famous for.

166
00:10:56,265 --> 00:11:00,205
Speaker 8:  But they're little capsules and you can stick anything in them. You can

167
00:11:00,205 --> 00:11:03,325
Speaker 8:  stick a motorcycle in them, you can stick a vacation home in them and they

168
00:11:03,345 --> 00:11:07,125
Speaker 8:  fit into a tiny little pill size thing that you stick in your pocket

169
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:10,525
Speaker 8:  and it's so convenient in that world, it makes them gazillionaires. And So

170
00:11:10,605 --> 00:11:14,485
Speaker 8:  I want that for me because I'm tired of carrying all my shit around in

171
00:11:14,485 --> 00:11:18,405
Speaker 8:  a backpack in New York City getting like real back pain,

172
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:22,365
Speaker 8:  carrying a laptop. This podcast Mike and everything. How do you deploy it?

173
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:26,565
Speaker 8:  Is it like Pokemon where you throw it? Yeah, yeah. Kind of. You

174
00:11:26,565 --> 00:11:30,405
Speaker 8:  like press a button and you throw it and your vacation home is there. I like

175
00:11:30,405 --> 00:11:33,925
Speaker 8:  that. Cool. Awesome. Your motorcycle is there. Awesome.

176
00:11:34,305 --> 00:11:38,125
Speaker 8:  Woo. You know like parking costs a fuck ton in New York City,

177
00:11:38,185 --> 00:11:41,885
Speaker 8:  so why not just go like, oh, am I done with my car? No, no

178
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:45,445
Speaker 8:  parking problems. Like amazing love that for me.

179
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:49,805
Speaker 2:  Oh, okay. I didn't like this at, I was gonna make fun of you first. Basically

180
00:11:49,805 --> 00:11:52,565
Speaker 2:  having all of the options in the world and choosing, I don't want to carry

181
00:11:52,685 --> 00:11:53,365
Speaker 2:  a purse anymore.

182
00:11:54,945 --> 00:11:58,645
Speaker 8:  I'm just gonna like tell everyone I'm gonna set the table stakes here. Every

183
00:11:58,645 --> 00:12:00,605
Speaker 8:  single one of my picks is selfish

184
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:02,245
Speaker 2:  As it should be.

185
00:12:02,635 --> 00:12:06,565
Speaker 8:  It's selfish. It helps my life get easier and truly

186
00:12:06,715 --> 00:12:09,205
Speaker 8:  reveals all the ways in which I'm lazy. So there is,

187
00:12:09,265 --> 00:12:12,205
Speaker 2:  Is there a limit to how many capsules one can have at a time?

188
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:16,045
Speaker 8:  You know, I don't think so. Okay. Just like how much you can carry, like

189
00:12:16,225 --> 00:12:19,125
Speaker 8:  BMA has like vests I think where she's just like, you know, look at my cap.

190
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:22,285
Speaker 8:  You know, like the trench coat with the, with the, the watch clocks and she's

191
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:25,245
Speaker 8:  like, eh, look at my capsules. I don't actually think there's an episode

192
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,045
Speaker 8:  where she does that, but I imagine that's what you can do. Whatever you can

193
00:12:28,045 --> 00:12:29,685
Speaker 8:  fit in your pocket. Capsules.

194
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:32,685
Speaker 2:  I like this more and more the more I think about it. I'm now thinking of

195
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,685
Speaker 2:  all the things that would just start carrying with me. This, this actually

196
00:12:34,685 --> 00:12:37,645
Speaker 2:  makes a lot of sense. Mia, you're up next. What's your first pick?

197
00:12:37,835 --> 00:12:41,805
Speaker 7:  Okay, my first pick was going to be in the similar vein so you can

198
00:12:41,805 --> 00:12:45,565
Speaker 7:  tell me if I can't, it might be even lazier than v's choice, which is like,

199
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:49,085
Speaker 7:  I want the giant pockets of animal crossing.

200
00:12:51,245 --> 00:12:54,325
Speaker 7:  'cause I don't even wanna carry the capsules. I don't wanna lose my car,

201
00:12:54,685 --> 00:12:57,805
Speaker 7:  I don't wanna lose my wallet. I don't wanna lose my tree that I'm carrying

202
00:12:57,805 --> 00:13:01,165
Speaker 7:  around. For some reason, I just wanted all in my pockets. I want endless

203
00:13:01,195 --> 00:13:04,485
Speaker 7:  deep pockets that I can carry like 20 sharks and

204
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:08,605
Speaker 7:  a peach. You know, that's what I want. So is that too close

205
00:13:08,865 --> 00:13:09,765
Speaker 7:  or do I have to pick something

206
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:12,765
Speaker 2:  Else? No, I'm, I'm good with it. It is, it's, it's different. What I'm just

207
00:13:12,765 --> 00:13:15,685
Speaker 2:  blown away by is, Jen is like, I would like to travel through space and time

208
00:13:15,685 --> 00:13:18,525
Speaker 2:  and you're just like, I'd like to have a peach with me. What if I just had

209
00:13:18,525 --> 00:13:18,805
Speaker 2:  a peach?

210
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:23,045
Speaker 8:  Great. There's a theme though to all of these picks so far in that it's larger

211
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:24,045
Speaker 8:  on the inside.

212
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:25,445
Speaker 7:  Yes, that's true. But

213
00:13:25,565 --> 00:13:28,885
Speaker 2:  Also just like I'm tired is a real vibe I'm getting from all of you. It's

214
00:13:28,885 --> 00:13:32,285
Speaker 2:  just like, I don't wanna, like I had to, I had to walk a lot of places with

215
00:13:32,315 --> 00:13:34,205
Speaker 2:  bags and what if I just didn't have to do that anymore.

216
00:13:34,385 --> 00:13:38,085
Speaker 7:  I'm so sick of it. Also, like my, I know that it's not a technology, but

217
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:41,685
Speaker 7:  on the animal crossing subject, my second pick would've been a raccoon landlord

218
00:13:41,715 --> 00:13:45,525
Speaker 7:  that lets me pay off my apartment in zero interest loans. Yeah.

219
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:49,405
Speaker 7:  And builds like a beautiful house for me. Yeah. And wears a Hawaiian shirt.

220
00:13:49,585 --> 00:13:49,805
Speaker 7:  So

221
00:13:49,805 --> 00:13:50,605
Speaker 8:  Where, where is,

222
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,005
Speaker 7:  IM guessing I can't draft Tom

223
00:13:52,005 --> 00:13:55,925
Speaker 8:  Nook. Where's Tom Nook? Where is Tom Nook and where

224
00:13:55,925 --> 00:13:59,725
Speaker 8:  is that stock market that actually, you know, lets people get rich?

225
00:14:02,995 --> 00:14:06,965
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Tom Nook. Animal crossing pockets are almost I

226
00:14:06,965 --> 00:14:10,725
Speaker 2:  think a violation of the, it has to be technology and not magic Okay. Rule.

227
00:14:10,745 --> 00:14:14,645
Speaker 2:  But I'll, I'll allow it. Amazing. I really, I did not expect this to just

228
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:18,205
Speaker 2:  be, how do I move things around in the first round? So listen,

229
00:14:18,305 --> 00:14:21,565
Speaker 8:  You were talking to four women and we have this,

230
00:14:22,555 --> 00:14:24,485
Speaker 7:  They don't give us pant pockets.

231
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,845
Speaker 2:  I'm also realizing my first pick fits perfectly into this theme. So this

232
00:14:27,845 --> 00:14:31,685
Speaker 2:  is gonna be great. Allison, you're up next. What's your first pick?

233
00:14:32,155 --> 00:14:34,925
Speaker 14:  Okay, I'm gonna pick the one that

234
00:14:36,145 --> 00:14:39,525
Speaker 14:  I'm worried someone else might pick. It's not

235
00:14:39,765 --> 00:14:43,045
Speaker 14:  necessarily like my favorite one, but I think it would come in handy

236
00:14:44,545 --> 00:14:48,405
Speaker 14:  in men in black, the little like little blinky

237
00:14:48,405 --> 00:14:52,245
Speaker 14:  light thing. Is it called the neuralizer? The neuro, the Alright.

238
00:14:52,685 --> 00:14:56,565
Speaker 14:  I want it specifically. I don't wanna like do crimes, I

239
00:14:56,565 --> 00:15:00,165
Speaker 14:  just want it for my social anxiety. So if I like

240
00:15:00,825 --> 00:15:04,805
Speaker 14:  say something stupid, I can be like, wait, wait, wait. Let me do

241
00:15:04,805 --> 00:15:05,405
Speaker 14:  that over again.

242
00:15:06,995 --> 00:15:09,965
Speaker 14:  Yeah. That, that's what I got. Okay. And I,

243
00:15:09,965 --> 00:15:12,845
Speaker 2:  Okay, so, so this, this is a good time to bring up something that we probably

244
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:16,165
Speaker 2:  should have talked about with the TARDIS in particular, which is the societal

245
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:20,125
Speaker 2:  implications. Because, because what happens here is it, and there I, I went

246
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,805
Speaker 2:  through this a bunch with a bunch of the things that I'm actually not going

247
00:15:22,805 --> 00:15:26,725
Speaker 2:  to pick as a result of this. But like you, Allison, I trust to

248
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:30,165
Speaker 2:  have a neuralizer. I think that would be fine, right? But if we're going

249
00:15:30,165 --> 00:15:33,885
Speaker 2:  to just sort of randomly sprinkle neuralizer on people around the earth

250
00:15:34,965 --> 00:15:38,445
Speaker 2:  Hmm. Potential problems. Lot could go wrong. Are we sure we want to

251
00:15:38,695 --> 00:15:39,965
Speaker 2:  bring this into existence?

252
00:15:40,475 --> 00:15:42,685
Speaker 14:  What if we can only use them on ourself?

253
00:15:43,505 --> 00:15:43,725
Speaker 2:  Ooh.

254
00:15:44,035 --> 00:15:45,725
Speaker 14:  Okay. But that

255
00:15:47,205 --> 00:15:50,565
Speaker 2:  I, no, but that would be worse. 'cause then then my social anxiety says,

256
00:15:50,565 --> 00:15:53,405
Speaker 2:  oh my God, what did I say to other people that I don't even remember now?

257
00:15:53,505 --> 00:15:55,605
Speaker 2:  No, no, no. What have I normalized out of myself?

258
00:15:55,745 --> 00:15:59,725
Speaker 14:  No, it's like a neuralizer light. You can't use it for any

259
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:03,045
Speaker 14:  like, serious, like heavy memories. Like

260
00:16:03,945 --> 00:16:07,765
Speaker 14:  forget about your whole life and your wife or

261
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:11,525
Speaker 14:  whatever it is in men black. It's just like, oh, I

262
00:16:12,155 --> 00:16:15,885
Speaker 14:  bent over the bookstore and it was quiet And I farted And I just gonna

263
00:16:16,165 --> 00:16:19,605
Speaker 14:  likeactually thing no one will ever know. Yeah.

264
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:22,885
Speaker 14:  Rewind for a few, just a few seconds. Yeah.

265
00:16:22,885 --> 00:16:23,125
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So

266
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,685
Speaker 2:  It's, it's like a neural, like a low stakes neuralizer is

267
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,485
Speaker 14:  Basically what you're talking about. Yes. The low stakes only. Okay,

268
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:31,845
Speaker 2:  Mia, is this a good idea? Should we allow, do we want this in the world?

269
00:16:33,445 --> 00:16:37,405
Speaker 7:  I just worry about if many people have it and everyone's

270
00:16:37,405 --> 00:16:41,285
Speaker 7:  forgetting the embarrassing thing they did, then that kind of disrupts

271
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:43,725
Speaker 7:  the equilibrium of the world. Everybody

272
00:16:43,725 --> 00:16:45,005
Speaker 2:  Becomes too confident. Yeah,

273
00:16:45,285 --> 00:16:48,605
Speaker 7:  Everyone becomes a little too confident. Everyone becomes a little too

274
00:16:48,765 --> 00:16:52,645
Speaker 7:  polished. And frankly, like I am fine doing embarrassing

275
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:55,405
Speaker 7:  things because I've seen a million people do really embarrassing things in

276
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:56,685
Speaker 7:  public. You know what I mean?

277
00:16:57,075 --> 00:16:58,605
Speaker 14:  It's kind of like social media that way.

278
00:16:59,275 --> 00:17:02,725
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Well I think that even if people had the neuralizer, they would not

279
00:17:02,725 --> 00:17:06,485
Speaker 7:  stop posting embarrassing things. True. That is true. So people would still

280
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:08,045
Speaker 7:  be idiots online. So maybe it's

281
00:17:08,045 --> 00:17:11,845
Speaker 2:  Fine. The neuralizer would make the real world like weird and

282
00:17:11,985 --> 00:17:15,005
Speaker 2:  not change social media one tiny bit at all. Internet would not change at

283
00:17:15,005 --> 00:17:15,885
Speaker 2:  all because of all,

284
00:17:16,465 --> 00:17:20,245
Speaker 7:  In fact they would be crazier online. Like, 'cause you have no other outlet.

285
00:17:20,865 --> 00:17:21,405
Speaker 14:  That's true.

286
00:17:22,185 --> 00:17:26,165
Speaker 2:  That's pretty good. All right. I get two now because

287
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:29,205
Speaker 2:  I get two. I'm gonna pick the one that I don't think is like the thing I

288
00:17:29,205 --> 00:17:32,165
Speaker 2:  should pick first, but is the one I want the most out of everything, which

289
00:17:32,165 --> 00:17:33,485
Speaker 2:  is the hoverboard from back to the Future two,

290
00:17:37,465 --> 00:17:38,765
Speaker 15:  Please. Done a hover board,

291
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:46,725
Speaker 2:  Which is just, and the beauty of this is, it's not just that I have one,

292
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:50,620
Speaker 2:  it's that lots of people have one. So we've now normalized this as a transportation

293
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:54,765
Speaker 2:  system and a way that to get around that is like, what if

294
00:17:54,835 --> 00:17:58,725
Speaker 2:  bird scooters, but like much cooler, which turns out to be like

295
00:17:58,755 --> 00:18:02,085
Speaker 2:  precisely the, the aesthetic I'm going for. And this is the true

296
00:18:02,535 --> 00:18:06,005
Speaker 2:  hoverboard that actually hovers. It seems to be very light.

297
00:18:06,355 --> 00:18:10,325
Speaker 2:  It's pink. It's very important to me that they're all pink. And,

298
00:18:10,385 --> 00:18:13,405
Speaker 2:  and you can just, you can ride around in the air. You can do all kinds of

299
00:18:13,405 --> 00:18:16,885
Speaker 2:  cool sick tricks. It's a way to get places, it's a way to get in fights.

300
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:21,095
Speaker 2:  This just feels like if I could just pick up a thing and be like, I'm going

301
00:18:21,095 --> 00:18:24,975
Speaker 2:  to instantly make everyone's life more fun to get

302
00:18:24,975 --> 00:18:28,725
Speaker 2:  around. I think I'm doing a great service to society with the

303
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:29,125
Speaker 2:  hoverboard.

304
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:32,565
Speaker 9:  Don't we already have hoverboards? Yeah, but they light on fire and then

305
00:18:32,565 --> 00:18:33,685
Speaker 9:  they go up in people's garages.

306
00:18:34,005 --> 00:18:37,885
Speaker 8:  They're not real. Like, they don't actually hover. They're

307
00:18:37,885 --> 00:18:40,045
Speaker 8:  just like stupid things with wheels on them.

308
00:18:40,665 --> 00:18:42,845
Speaker 2:  To be fair, I was also a big fan of those hoverboards.

309
00:18:44,145 --> 00:18:45,125
Speaker 9:  Oh no. Just

310
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:49,405
Speaker 2:  Like they were a good idea except for the whole, like they exploded and were

311
00:18:49,405 --> 00:18:53,125
Speaker 2:  impossible to ride thing. But I was, I was in on that.

312
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:54,125
Speaker 9:  Did you have one?

313
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:57,125
Speaker 2:  I I still might have one somewhere.

314
00:18:57,995 --> 00:19:01,965
Speaker 9:  Ride it now. Do it now. I feel like we're gonna need some traffic

315
00:19:02,195 --> 00:19:05,845
Speaker 9:  laws though, because we've seen with scooters and the

316
00:19:06,755 --> 00:19:10,445
Speaker 9:  e-bikes and everything that out there today, these

317
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:14,605
Speaker 9:  pedestrian type vehicles that move fast and break things can be quite

318
00:19:14,615 --> 00:19:15,805
Speaker 9:  awful and dangerous.

319
00:19:16,985 --> 00:19:19,845
Speaker 8:  If you want the privilege of a hoverboard, you have to go to the DMV and

320
00:19:19,845 --> 00:19:23,765
Speaker 8:  get a hoverboard license because otherwise you're just

321
00:19:23,765 --> 00:19:26,285
Speaker 8:  a fucking menace. A traffic menace. Yeah.

322
00:19:26,285 --> 00:19:28,485
Speaker 2:  To be fair, I think people should have to do that with scooters. So I'm,

323
00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:29,525
Speaker 2:  I'm actually fine. This,

324
00:19:29,765 --> 00:19:30,045
Speaker 9:  Yeah,

325
00:19:30,305 --> 00:19:33,325
Speaker 2:  It should be much harder to get one of these things on the street, but I

326
00:19:33,325 --> 00:19:35,885
Speaker 2:  kind of like to think of it like there's a very powerful hoverboard lobby

327
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:39,005
Speaker 2:  that has made it so that they just coexist with cars now. And, and everybody's

328
00:19:39,005 --> 00:19:39,405
Speaker 2:  fine with this.

329
00:19:39,965 --> 00:19:42,525
Speaker 8:  I like that we're just writing fan fiction. This is great.

330
00:19:43,395 --> 00:19:46,605
Speaker 2:  I've solved a lot of problems here. All right. So that's my first pick.

331
00:19:47,705 --> 00:19:51,425
Speaker 2:  I think for my second pick. I'm just gonna take Jarvis from Iron

332
00:19:51,485 --> 00:19:51,705
Speaker 2:  Man.

333
00:19:52,045 --> 00:19:54,825
Speaker 9:  Oh, lost two already. Darn it.

334
00:19:55,715 --> 00:19:57,545
Speaker 16:  Micro repeater implant sequence. Complete

335
00:19:57,885 --> 00:20:01,305
Speaker 17:  As you wish. Sir, I've also prepared a safety briefing for you to entirely

336
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,345
Speaker 17:  ignore, which

337
00:20:02,545 --> 00:20:04,305
Speaker 16:  I will. All right, let's do this.

338
00:20:05,485 --> 00:20:08,545
Speaker 17:  Sir. May I remind you that you've been awake for nearly 72 hours.

339
00:20:09,725 --> 00:20:12,985
Speaker 2:  I'm not gonna take another of the, like all purpose do everything Machines

340
00:20:12,985 --> 00:20:16,105
Speaker 2:  that let me travel back to a time, this is the closest one to just like

341
00:20:17,205 --> 00:20:20,855
Speaker 2:  my all purpose AI helper that makes me

342
00:20:20,965 --> 00:20:24,655
Speaker 2:  sick at everything. And I think of all of them.

343
00:20:25,965 --> 00:20:29,705
Speaker 2:  Jarvis is the best one. V You And I talk a lot about Jarvis, like, is

344
00:20:29,705 --> 00:20:30,985
Speaker 2:  Jarvis, is Jarvis the best one?

345
00:20:31,465 --> 00:20:35,065
Speaker 8:  I think Jarvis is the best one. Okay. Or like, if you wanna get nitty gritty,

346
00:20:35,165 --> 00:20:38,465
Speaker 8:  you could have like Friday or the other ones that Tony Stark has made. But

347
00:20:38,465 --> 00:20:42,265
Speaker 8:  like an AI that Tony Stark has made that is like with the power

348
00:20:42,265 --> 00:20:46,025
Speaker 8:  of science fiction, capable of doing all the things that the AI of

349
00:20:46,025 --> 00:20:50,005
Speaker 8:  today cannot actually do in a way that actually is natural

350
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:54,335
Speaker 8:  language. And it's like, oh, you know, I could deal with Paul

351
00:20:54,425 --> 00:20:58,335
Speaker 8:  Beney in my ear telling me sassy little things and, and like reminders.

352
00:20:58,365 --> 00:20:58,655
Speaker 8:  Like

353
00:20:58,935 --> 00:21:02,775
Speaker 2:  I do worry that Jarvis would find me very unimpressive that like, this is,

354
00:21:02,775 --> 00:21:05,055
Speaker 2:  this is what I worry about with Jarvis. It's like, I don't want the suit,

355
00:21:05,335 --> 00:21:08,575
Speaker 2:  I don't wanna like do cool stuff. I just wanna be like, Jarvis, where did

356
00:21:08,575 --> 00:21:11,775
Speaker 2:  I leave my wallet? And for Jarvis to be like, it's in the stroller where

357
00:21:11,775 --> 00:21:15,175
Speaker 2:  it always is. And like this, this is the extent of what I require.

358
00:21:15,555 --> 00:21:15,775
Speaker 2:  And

359
00:21:16,015 --> 00:21:19,615
Speaker 8:  I do like that Jarvis keeps Tony humble. He's just like, oh you idiot, it's

360
00:21:19,615 --> 00:21:23,535
Speaker 8:  over there. Like, I want, I, I need like a, a a degree of that in

361
00:21:23,535 --> 00:21:27,175
Speaker 8:  my life. It's just like, oh you ding bat. It's right where you left it.

362
00:21:27,555 --> 00:21:29,535
Speaker 2:  And it is important that it's Paul Beney. You're right about that.

363
00:21:29,805 --> 00:21:32,015
Speaker 8:  Yes'. Very important that it's Paul Beney. It has

364
00:21:32,015 --> 00:21:34,775
Speaker 7:  To have an English accent. Yeah. That's the important part. Yeah.

365
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:38,615
Speaker 2:  A hundred percent. So tho those are my two. I feel I feel very good about

366
00:21:38,615 --> 00:21:41,735
Speaker 2:  this. I think I have accomplished some things here. I have a way to get around

367
00:21:42,275 --> 00:21:46,135
Speaker 2:  and I have just like my non terrifying AI buddy to hang out with

368
00:21:46,135 --> 00:21:48,775
Speaker 2:  all day round two. Alison, you're up.

369
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:53,035
Speaker 14:  All right. I'm gonna go with the holodeck from Star Trek.

370
00:21:53,485 --> 00:21:54,115
Speaker 2:  Solid choice.

371
00:21:54,465 --> 00:21:58,195
Speaker 14:  Yeah. Like, and I have no problem with everybody else having this too. We

372
00:21:58,195 --> 00:22:01,715
Speaker 14:  can all have our little, like, you'd be like, you know what I'm gonna piece

373
00:22:01,715 --> 00:22:05,555
Speaker 14:  out. I'm gonna go sit on a mountain for 20 minutes. Wait,

374
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:08,035
Speaker 7:  Can you explain what it is? 'cause I've never seen Star Trek.

375
00:22:08,305 --> 00:22:08,995
Speaker 14:  Okay. So

376
00:22:09,665 --> 00:22:13,395
Speaker 7:  Does she, is she allowed to work at The Verge? She's never seen Stark. I'm

377
00:22:13,395 --> 00:22:13,435
Speaker 7:  not,

378
00:22:13,635 --> 00:22:15,035
Speaker 8:  Oh wait,

379
00:22:15,225 --> 00:22:16,835
Speaker 7:  Literally. No. I'ma

380
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:20,795
Speaker 8:  Back you up Mia. I've only seen the Star Trek movies, so we're good.

381
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:24,835
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And I just, I just saw Star Wars for the first time in my entire life.

382
00:22:24,835 --> 00:22:26,555
Speaker 7:  Oh my goodness. Mia, you might need to stop.

383
00:22:26,905 --> 00:22:30,595
Speaker 8:  Okay. Okay. Oh my goodness. You know, star Trek, the one was fine, but two,

384
00:22:30,865 --> 00:22:31,515
Speaker 7:  Both of those.

385
00:22:32,015 --> 00:22:34,715
Speaker 8:  But you know. No, no, no. She's seen it. She's seen it now guys. She's seen

386
00:22:34,715 --> 00:22:35,515
Speaker 8:  it now. I've seen

387
00:22:35,815 --> 00:22:37,115
Speaker 7:  One now I've seen one. Which one?

388
00:22:37,845 --> 00:22:38,995
Speaker 8:  Which one? The

389
00:22:38,995 --> 00:22:40,875
Speaker 7:  First one question mark.

390
00:22:40,945 --> 00:22:42,675
Speaker 8:  That, that's a loaded question. Yeah.

391
00:22:42,675 --> 00:22:45,995
Speaker 2:  If you like accidentally watch Phantom Menace, we have a real problem. Was

392
00:22:45,995 --> 00:22:46,875
Speaker 2:  George r Binks there?

393
00:22:47,495 --> 00:22:48,195
Speaker 7:  No. Okay.

394
00:22:48,495 --> 00:22:51,115
Speaker 8:  No, we're fine actually. So it's, it's the, it's the chronological first

395
00:22:51,175 --> 00:22:53,715
Speaker 8:  one, not the story. First one, we're gonna pause

396
00:22:53,715 --> 00:22:57,395
Speaker 2:  This podcast. Mia's gonna go watch all the Star Wars and we'll, we'll resume.

397
00:22:57,935 --> 00:23:00,675
Speaker 8:  No, we'll make her watch all of them. Some of them are not worth,

398
00:23:00,865 --> 00:23:03,275
Speaker 2:  Yeah, there's like five of them you should watch. It'll be all right. But

399
00:23:03,275 --> 00:23:05,155
Speaker 2:  wait, Alison, explain. Explain the Holodeck.

400
00:23:05,505 --> 00:23:09,355
Speaker 14:  Okay. Holodeck, it's like a medium sized room that

401
00:23:09,575 --> 00:23:13,195
Speaker 14:  is just like pixels or something and there's a little control

402
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:17,235
Speaker 14:  panel on the outside. And you want to, if you wanna go to

403
00:23:17,235 --> 00:23:21,035
Speaker 14:  like a rainforest or seal waterfall, you go like

404
00:23:21,065 --> 00:23:25,035
Speaker 14:  boop, boop, boop boop. And you put it on the control panel and the room

405
00:23:25,165 --> 00:23:29,075
Speaker 14:  turns into wherever you wanna go. And I think that's

406
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:30,995
Speaker 14:  perfect And I want one.

407
00:23:31,465 --> 00:23:34,075
Speaker 7:  That sounds great. Don't we already have that with the Vision Pro?

408
00:23:34,905 --> 00:23:36,955
Speaker 8:  Yeah, but someone was gonna say Vision Pro

409
00:23:36,955 --> 00:23:37,315
Speaker 14:  God, God

410
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,275
Speaker 8:  Damnit. No, absolutely not. This

411
00:23:39,275 --> 00:23:40,995
Speaker 14:  Is not the same thing. I'm not gonna

412
00:23:41,075 --> 00:23:44,435
Speaker 8:  Holodeck. Yeah, comfy Vision Pro. Not comfy.

413
00:23:44,755 --> 00:23:44,875
Speaker 7:  I

414
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:48,645
Speaker 14:  Wanna like, you can interact with stuff in the holodeck.

415
00:23:48,715 --> 00:23:52,365
Speaker 14:  Like it's, it's like semi real, you know,

416
00:23:52,555 --> 00:23:55,605
Speaker 14:  like if there's a waterfall then there's

417
00:23:56,255 --> 00:23:59,605
Speaker 14:  maybe real water. I don't know. Maybe let's not get to You

418
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:02,725
Speaker 2:  Experience it like it's real, I think, but it's, but it's not, which is very

419
00:24:02,725 --> 00:24:06,405
Speaker 2:  important. Right? I I honestly believe the world would be a much better place

420
00:24:06,505 --> 00:24:07,605
Speaker 2:  if there were holodecks everywhere.

421
00:24:07,605 --> 00:24:08,125
Speaker 14:  Wouldn't it be so

422
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:11,765
Speaker 8:  Good? Most importantly, you don't have to wear anything. Yes, very true.

423
00:24:11,765 --> 00:24:12,965
Speaker 8:  Like, that's my big thing. Yeah.

424
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:16,565
Speaker 9:  Well, and it, it was interesting how it changed throughout the seasons. It

425
00:24:16,565 --> 00:24:20,365
Speaker 9:  became an entire like world that you would go into and like having

426
00:24:20,365 --> 00:24:24,125
Speaker 9:  entire stories and act out dreams and ideas.

427
00:24:24,305 --> 00:24:27,885
Speaker 9:  And I remember they used to go, there was a lot of westerns in the holiday.

428
00:24:27,945 --> 00:24:28,165
Speaker 9:  Oh

429
00:24:28,165 --> 00:24:28,245
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

430
00:24:28,825 --> 00:24:29,605
Speaker 9:  For some reason.

431
00:24:30,985 --> 00:24:34,845
Speaker 14:  That's the dude holodeck. Every dude wants to go into a western

432
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:36,165
Speaker 14:  Hundred percent. I'm just like,

433
00:24:36,755 --> 00:24:40,645
Speaker 9:  Yeah. What is, what would be your ideal holodeck experience?

434
00:24:41,405 --> 00:24:45,325
Speaker 14:  I think it would be the top of a mountain, because it takes a long

435
00:24:45,595 --> 00:24:49,525
Speaker 14:  time to drive to a mountain and hike all the way to the top. And I love

436
00:24:49,525 --> 00:24:53,285
Speaker 14:  doing that. And I do that from time to time. But sometimes you wanna like

437
00:24:53,315 --> 00:24:57,205
Speaker 14:  microdose top of mountain experience And I could just like,

438
00:24:57,675 --> 00:25:01,285
Speaker 14:  hang out for a little bit and come back and like deal with my 3-year-old

439
00:25:01,665 --> 00:25:03,365
Speaker 14:  and be chill. That's what I want.

440
00:25:03,805 --> 00:25:07,685
Speaker 2:  I do think we need strict time limits on holodeck usage. Yeah.

441
00:25:08,105 --> 00:25:09,645
Speaker 14:  The world. You can't like go live in the holodeck.

442
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:13,125
Speaker 2:  Right. We're we're talking like, like a 60 minute a day kind of

443
00:25:13,255 --> 00:25:14,445
Speaker 2:  experience. Yeah,

444
00:25:14,445 --> 00:25:14,725
Speaker 14:  Yeah.

445
00:25:15,385 --> 00:25:19,125
Speaker 2:  But with some time limit. I sincerely believe the world would be a much better

446
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:21,605
Speaker 2:  place if we all had access to holodeck. I think I would. And you can just

447
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:25,965
Speaker 2:  go like, get out of your system or experience whatever you

448
00:25:25,965 --> 00:25:29,525
Speaker 2:  need to over there. Yep. And then it's, and then

449
00:25:29,715 --> 00:25:30,085
Speaker 2:  come back

450
00:25:30,265 --> 00:25:32,365
Speaker 8:  To David Reality. I thought we weren't trying to make the world a better

451
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:33,245
Speaker 8:  place with our fix.

452
00:25:34,395 --> 00:25:38,165
Speaker 14:  It's a byproduct. I want my world to be a better place.

453
00:25:38,755 --> 00:25:39,045
Speaker 14:  Yeah.

454
00:25:39,475 --> 00:25:43,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah. That's a, that's a very good one. That was the next one on my list.

455
00:25:43,305 --> 00:25:45,765
Speaker 2:  And I'm sort of sad I didn't pick it. Mia, you're up.

456
00:25:46,555 --> 00:25:49,925
Speaker 7:  Okay. Just strategically, I think I need to, to grab

457
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:52,365
Speaker 7:  the clueless closet. Yeah.

458
00:25:52,365 --> 00:25:53,845
Speaker 2:  Surprised it took this long. Honestly.

459
00:25:54,035 --> 00:25:57,645
Speaker 7:  It's classic. It is so fun. I just rewatched the clip

460
00:25:58,965 --> 00:26:02,765
Speaker 7:  a little bit ago. I will say I'm like halfway there not to

461
00:26:02,765 --> 00:26:06,725
Speaker 7:  brag, but I have, it's, it's not as pretty. But

462
00:26:06,885 --> 00:26:10,365
Speaker 7:  I do have a mega spreadsheet that is an

463
00:26:10,365 --> 00:26:14,285
Speaker 7:  inventory of every single piece of clothing I own. Oh. And then, oh my

464
00:26:14,285 --> 00:26:17,925
Speaker 7:  God, the season and the color and where it is in my apartment, like where

465
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:21,925
Speaker 7:  it's being stored, whether it's vintage, whether it's

466
00:26:21,925 --> 00:26:25,365
Speaker 7:  from my mom, like any tags, like keywords.

467
00:26:25,945 --> 00:26:29,325
Speaker 7:  So I will say like, this would, this would visualize

468
00:26:29,845 --> 00:26:31,685
Speaker 7:  a, an insane thing that I'm already doing.

469
00:26:32,065 --> 00:26:34,445
Speaker 2:  Can you describe how the clueless closet works for anyone who hasn't seen

470
00:26:34,445 --> 00:26:34,725
Speaker 2:  the movie?

471
00:26:35,025 --> 00:26:38,325
Speaker 7:  So it kind of, it like pulls in all of Cher's

472
00:26:38,605 --> 00:26:42,405
Speaker 7:  articles of clothing and then she, on her computer, she can kind of scroll

473
00:26:42,405 --> 00:26:46,205
Speaker 7:  through them and it matches. She combines a top

474
00:26:46,225 --> 00:26:49,725
Speaker 7:  and a bottom and then the computer will be like, wrong,

475
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:53,325
Speaker 7:  ugly, or it will be like, good, cute.

476
00:26:54,105 --> 00:26:57,925
Speaker 7:  And it's sort of like, in a way, like, I feel like a lot of these ai

477
00:26:57,995 --> 00:27:01,805
Speaker 7:  like outfit things are trying to harness

478
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:05,565
Speaker 7:  that. But it's the, the clueless one is so cute.

479
00:27:05,985 --> 00:27:09,885
Speaker 7:  It looks so fun. It has that very, like, the really good

480
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:13,965
Speaker 7:  like late nineties, early two thousands aesthetic. Like, it's just so good.

481
00:27:15,185 --> 00:27:19,005
Speaker 7:  And yeah, I have a lot of clothes. I have a lot of clothes And I need it.

482
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:23,365
Speaker 2:  Are you sure your spreadsheet isn't enough? You're like one column of photos

483
00:27:23,515 --> 00:27:25,405
Speaker 2:  away from just having completely solved this problem.

484
00:27:25,965 --> 00:27:29,245
Speaker 7:  I know. Well actually, I've seen online some people will like, photograph

485
00:27:29,245 --> 00:27:32,885
Speaker 7:  themselves wearing every article of clothing and then cut their body in half

486
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:36,565
Speaker 7:  and make like a flip book of the closet, which is really a really cute idea.

487
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:40,805
Speaker 7:  Oh my God. But I just do not have the patience for that. Also, there is no

488
00:27:40,805 --> 00:27:44,765
Speaker 7:  three ring binder that is even close to big enough for me to put all my clothes

489
00:27:45,065 --> 00:27:45,285
Speaker 7:  in.

490
00:27:45,975 --> 00:27:49,405
Speaker 2:  Would you update anything from the clueless closet is my main question. It's,

491
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:52,805
Speaker 2:  it's, 'cause that's a, that's an older idea about this stuff. But I think

492
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:55,525
Speaker 2:  back and I'm like, it, they actually, it was sort of perfect. I don't, I

493
00:27:55,525 --> 00:27:57,165
Speaker 2:  don't need any features. Think that I didn't have,

494
00:27:57,325 --> 00:28:01,085
Speaker 7:  I think, yeah, don't overcomplicate it like top and bottom. That's pretty

495
00:28:01,085 --> 00:28:03,965
Speaker 7:  much, I mean, that's kind of the basis of every outfit, unless you're wearing

496
00:28:03,965 --> 00:28:07,845
Speaker 7:  like a dress or something. But don't make it too complicated. I just

497
00:28:07,845 --> 00:28:11,645
Speaker 7:  want, just like generate an idea for me or tell me if my idea is bad.

498
00:28:12,085 --> 00:28:16,005
Speaker 7:  I would mostly, it's like visualizing it. Hmm. Like you can see it before

499
00:28:16,545 --> 00:28:19,685
Speaker 7:  you put it on your body and then have to take it off and hang it back up

500
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:23,605
Speaker 7:  and fold it or whatever. So yeah. Not, I, I would not change a single

501
00:28:23,605 --> 00:28:25,005
Speaker 7:  thing. I want it as is.

502
00:28:25,465 --> 00:28:28,445
Speaker 2:  That's a good one. I like it. All right. V you're up.

503
00:28:29,415 --> 00:28:32,745
Speaker 8:  Okay, so this is gonna make me sound like a total anime nerd, but once again,

504
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:36,665
Speaker 8:  I am, I am taking from the world of Dragon Ball Z And

505
00:28:36,945 --> 00:28:40,505
Speaker 8:  I want Scouters. So if you've never watched Dragon Ball

506
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:43,465
Speaker 2:  ZV, am I gonna have to make a rule that you can't pick all your things from

507
00:28:43,465 --> 00:28:43,625
Speaker 2:  one?

508
00:28:43,945 --> 00:28:47,705
Speaker 8:  No, I only, I literally only had two. I only literally only had the two.

509
00:28:47,845 --> 00:28:51,065
Speaker 8:  And so the scouters from Dragon Ball Z are like these little

510
00:28:52,195 --> 00:28:55,985
Speaker 8:  heads up display augmented reality type situations

511
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:59,785
Speaker 8:  where it fits over one part of your eye. If you have been online

512
00:28:59,845 --> 00:29:02,385
Speaker 8:  in the last 20 years, you've probably heard it's over

513
00:29:02,495 --> 00:29:03,305
Speaker 18:  9,000,

514
00:29:04,345 --> 00:29:08,105
Speaker 8:  Which is just Ji screaming because kus power level is over 9,000.

515
00:29:08,985 --> 00:29:09,185
Speaker 8:  Ji

516
00:29:09,565 --> 00:29:12,385
Speaker 18:  What's wrong with you? Tell me what his power level is.

517
00:29:13,455 --> 00:29:17,305
Speaker 18:  It's over 9,000 plus 9,000. You've

518
00:29:17,305 --> 00:29:17,745
Speaker 18:  gotta be

519
00:29:17,745 --> 00:29:21,625
Speaker 8:  Kidding me. The idea is that it can bioscan like life forms

520
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:25,505
Speaker 8:  and tell you what their power level is. And I just think that this would

521
00:29:25,505 --> 00:29:29,225
Speaker 8:  be really great for my social anxiety if I can go

522
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:32,985
Speaker 8:  into a meeting or anything and just put this on and go like,

523
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:37,025
Speaker 8:  oh, my power level is over that of random e executive.

524
00:29:37,095 --> 00:29:40,985
Speaker 8:  Cool. I can just relax now. Like if I, you know, I

525
00:29:41,085 --> 00:29:43,885
Speaker 8:  just think it would be great for people if they were going into job interviews

526
00:29:43,885 --> 00:29:46,725
Speaker 8:  and they could put a little scatter on their face and go like, oh, the schmuck,

527
00:29:46,835 --> 00:29:50,765
Speaker 8:  this HR rep, this, this schmuck is like 2000 power levels below me.

528
00:29:50,905 --> 00:29:52,285
Speaker 8:  I'm good, I'm cool. I'm Gucci.

529
00:29:52,435 --> 00:29:54,765
Speaker 2:  What if it tells you something you're not prepared to know about?

530
00:29:54,995 --> 00:29:58,165
Speaker 8:  Well then you're, then you're allowed to panic. But then, you know, at least

531
00:29:58,225 --> 00:30:02,045
Speaker 8:  you have your, your mindset going like, oh, I need to be on top of my game.

532
00:30:02,445 --> 00:30:04,045
Speaker 8:  Like, you can calibrate what your, then

533
00:30:04,045 --> 00:30:06,405
Speaker 2:  You have your motorcycle in a capsule and you just ride away. Then you

534
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:09,365
Speaker 8:  Have my motorcycle in a capsule and I'm like, bye-bye. I'm

535
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:14,085
Speaker 8:  Oh, your power level's over 9,000. Okay, motorcycle in the capsule.

536
00:30:14,155 --> 00:30:17,925
Speaker 8:  Bye-bye. I'm, I'm good. So like that's my, I just

537
00:30:18,165 --> 00:30:21,765
Speaker 8:  want scouters And I, I want it like, in my ideal world, you could tweak it

538
00:30:21,765 --> 00:30:25,325
Speaker 8:  to whatever you want. So oh, you're, you're going on a date.

539
00:30:26,485 --> 00:30:29,765
Speaker 8:  Calibrate it to Riz. Like how much charisma does this person that you're

540
00:30:29,765 --> 00:30:33,405
Speaker 8:  going on a date have with? Oh, they're, their, their Riz level is

541
00:30:33,435 --> 00:30:37,405
Speaker 8:  9,000. Okay. Now you, you can be on alert for every lie

542
00:30:37,405 --> 00:30:38,605
Speaker 8:  that comes out of their mouth.

543
00:30:38,915 --> 00:30:40,685
Speaker 2:  It's the ultimate like, read the room machine.

544
00:30:41,365 --> 00:30:43,845
Speaker 8:  Read the room machine. I like this. You just go, you go read the room and

545
00:30:43,845 --> 00:30:47,245
Speaker 8:  you go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. And if I ever got to meet Tim Cook, I would be

546
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,125
Speaker 8:  able to be like, oh, cool.

547
00:30:49,465 --> 00:30:53,405
Speaker 9:  Is it like a, I I I still don't quite get what it is. Does it let you

548
00:30:53,635 --> 00:30:55,125
Speaker 9:  read their mind kind of

549
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:58,725
Speaker 8:  Thing? No, no. It just like, so like in their world does that, everyone has

550
00:30:58,725 --> 00:31:01,725
Speaker 8:  something called Key. So like, it's like their power level. It's like how

551
00:31:02,005 --> 00:31:05,725
Speaker 8:  powerful they are. Oh. So I doesn't read their mind. It just like assigns

552
00:31:05,725 --> 00:31:09,285
Speaker 8:  an, like, this person is really powerful. So, so

553
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:09,765
Speaker 9:  You're just kind

554
00:31:09,765 --> 00:31:10,245
Speaker 8:  Of that sort of thing,

555
00:31:10,355 --> 00:31:12,685
Speaker 9:  Getting a, a vibe from them kind of?

556
00:31:12,945 --> 00:31:16,765
Speaker 8:  Yes. Kind of like a, like a numerical, you know, I'm wearable lady, so of

557
00:31:16,765 --> 00:31:20,365
Speaker 8:  course you get a metric level of some person's specific attribute.

558
00:31:20,865 --> 00:31:24,765
Speaker 8:  So you can, like my, I my ideal version of it, you just be like,

559
00:31:24,825 --> 00:31:28,725
Speaker 8:  oh, I would like to see what someone's friendliness level is when I go

560
00:31:28,725 --> 00:31:31,965
Speaker 8:  into like a group of people I've never met before. Ah, scanning

561
00:31:32,645 --> 00:31:35,405
Speaker 8:  the friendliest person. Okay, this person will give me the least anxiety

562
00:31:35,465 --> 00:31:39,125
Speaker 8:  to talk to. Like that sort of thing. Or, you know, it could be used for evil.

563
00:31:39,185 --> 00:31:41,925
Speaker 8:  It could be like, who is the most manipulable person in this room?

564
00:31:43,075 --> 00:31:44,085
Speaker 8:  Like, so there's,

565
00:31:44,865 --> 00:31:46,405
Speaker 9:  We love quantifying humans.

566
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:51,165
Speaker 8:  Yeah. That's, that's literally my job. Except

567
00:31:51,165 --> 00:31:55,085
Speaker 8:  usually I quantify myself. So like, this is just, you

568
00:31:55,085 --> 00:31:58,245
Speaker 8:  know, it's kind of like in Allison's vein of, of the Neuralizer, which was

569
00:31:58,245 --> 00:32:01,725
Speaker 8:  also gonna be one of my picks. Don you Allison. But it's,

570
00:32:01,955 --> 00:32:05,925
Speaker 8:  it's just like a way of managing social anxiety is how I

571
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:06,285
Speaker 8:  view it.

572
00:32:06,785 --> 00:32:10,605
Speaker 2:  You, I know just knowing you, I'm sure you have 38 wearables on right now.

573
00:32:10,825 --> 00:32:13,725
Speaker 2:  You would just wear this thing all the time. Do you think most people wear

574
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:17,005
Speaker 2:  this all the time? Like is this just a, a fixture on everybody's heads forever

575
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:17,405
Speaker 2:  now?

576
00:32:18,665 --> 00:32:21,485
Speaker 8:  No, And I actually wouldn't wear it all the time. I would mostly wear it

577
00:32:21,505 --> 00:32:25,405
Speaker 8:  in like social situations where I'm just trying to like get a sense of my

578
00:32:25,725 --> 00:32:29,445
Speaker 8:  bearings and like what I need to, to be aware of going

579
00:32:29,555 --> 00:32:33,445
Speaker 8:  into a room. Because like, I don't know, like my, I

580
00:32:33,445 --> 00:32:36,885
Speaker 8:  don't really have an internal monologue, but I do have stress levels

581
00:32:37,175 --> 00:32:40,725
Speaker 8:  shoot through the roof when I have to meet a bunch of people or just be around

582
00:32:40,795 --> 00:32:44,645
Speaker 8:  more than two humans at a time. I just go like, so

583
00:32:45,385 --> 00:32:46,925
Speaker 8:  that's my way of solving

584
00:32:47,475 --> 00:32:47,765
Speaker 9:  That.

585
00:32:48,155 --> 00:32:51,685
Speaker 2:  Okay. I like this. I'm not positive.

586
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:54,645
Speaker 2:  This ends up being a good idea. Oh. But I like,

587
00:32:54,995 --> 00:32:58,965
Speaker 8:  It's absolute horrible idea, but I like it. I'm telling you, all

588
00:32:58,965 --> 00:33:00,765
Speaker 8:  of my picks are selfish. So there we go.

589
00:33:01,035 --> 00:33:03,525
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I love this for you. Who, who cares what happens to everybody else?

590
00:33:03,755 --> 00:33:06,725
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Jen, you're up, you get two now.

591
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:10,685
Speaker 9:  I'm going, I'm afraid I'm going to some more big splashy tech this time.

592
00:33:11,145 --> 00:33:14,885
Speaker 9:  My next few are a little less splashy, but I'm not sure

593
00:33:14,885 --> 00:33:17,885
Speaker 9:  that three quarters of the room is gonna remember this one. But I'm gonna

594
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:19,805
Speaker 9:  start with the theme song and we'll see.

595
00:33:29,325 --> 00:33:32,965
Speaker 9:  I want, I want Kit explain. Okay, kid. I

596
00:33:32,965 --> 00:33:34,685
Speaker 8:  Know Three Girls. Yeah,

597
00:33:37,145 --> 00:33:41,005
Speaker 2:  Kit was on my list. Oh, okay. Kit was on my list. I admit I am,

598
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:45,085
Speaker 2:  I am more familiar with Kit than I am with Knight Rider, So I see. So I

599
00:33:45,085 --> 00:33:48,605
Speaker 2:  I left you hanging unintentionally there. Okay. But Kit is a very good pick.

600
00:33:48,845 --> 00:33:51,885
Speaker 2:  E explain to the, the, the unknown in to the

601
00:33:51,885 --> 00:33:52,645
Speaker 9:  Young people in the,

602
00:33:53,305 --> 00:33:54,925
Speaker 2:  To the Youths of America.

603
00:33:55,425 --> 00:33:59,285
Speaker 9:  Yes. So Kit is an an acronym. So

604
00:33:59,305 --> 00:34:03,165
Speaker 9:  Kit is Knight Industries 2000. And it is a smart

605
00:34:03,345 --> 00:34:06,805
Speaker 9:  car And I mean a really smart car.

606
00:34:07,555 --> 00:34:10,925
Speaker 9:  It's basically like a Jarvis in a car and

607
00:34:11,545 --> 00:34:15,525
Speaker 9:  in a Pontiac Firebird TransAm, in fact, which was not

608
00:34:15,605 --> 00:34:19,045
Speaker 9:  a fact I knew until I researched for this because I'm not a a

609
00:34:19,045 --> 00:34:22,885
Speaker 9:  Motorhead. But yes, it is a black car that has a

610
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:26,725
Speaker 9:  smart assistant inside. You know, I'm the smart home lady here,

611
00:34:26,745 --> 00:34:30,365
Speaker 9:  So I needed my smart assistant, but it's on wheels, which

612
00:34:30,605 --> 00:34:34,285
Speaker 9:  doesn't get much better. It can do everything. Like literally, I don't think

613
00:34:34,285 --> 00:34:38,165
Speaker 9:  there's anything that Kit didn't do during the however many seasons

614
00:34:38,165 --> 00:34:41,645
Speaker 9:  there were of Night Rider, which were many starring David Hasselhoff,

615
00:34:42,105 --> 00:34:44,765
Speaker 9:  pre Baywatch and such a good show.

616
00:34:46,005 --> 00:34:49,565
Speaker 9:  They revived it. I don't think I watched any of that. They did it recently.

617
00:34:49,605 --> 00:34:53,525
Speaker 9:  I think you didn't miss anything. No, and it's basically

618
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:57,565
Speaker 9:  a self-aware computer in a car. And David Knight,

619
00:34:57,705 --> 00:35:01,205
Speaker 9:  who is David Hasselhoff has a watch and he can call

620
00:35:01,665 --> 00:35:05,085
Speaker 9:  you kind of need both pieces of tech, but he can call Kit to him when he's

621
00:35:05,225 --> 00:35:08,765
Speaker 9:  in danger. And so like he'll, he, he uses the watch to

622
00:35:09,005 --> 00:35:12,925
Speaker 9:  communicate and Kit would like just come to the rescue and like blow

623
00:35:12,925 --> 00:35:16,805
Speaker 9:  through walls and rescue him. And he has all

624
00:35:16,805 --> 00:35:20,725
Speaker 9:  sorts of like sense. I mean he, he ha he's a self-driving car

625
00:35:20,925 --> 00:35:24,845
Speaker 9:  to start with and he has senses that can like means that, that

626
00:35:24,905 --> 00:35:27,685
Speaker 9:  he, I'm sorry it, I should not

627
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:33,125
Speaker 9:  the ai, but it has sensors that can smell,

628
00:35:33,435 --> 00:35:37,245
Speaker 9:  feel like scanners that can see inside buildings. So like when

629
00:35:37,455 --> 00:35:41,245
Speaker 9:  David Hasselhoff, David Knight, was it David Knight?

630
00:35:41,445 --> 00:35:45,325
Speaker 9:  I I get my sounds. I'm getting my David's confused. I know one of the reasons

631
00:35:45,385 --> 00:35:49,085
Speaker 9:  I'm getting my David's confused is because sidebar, my

632
00:35:49,095 --> 00:35:53,085
Speaker 9:  uncle David Darlene was the stuntman for night rider. So

633
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:53,525
Speaker 9:  what?

634
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,085
Speaker 8:  Very cool, cool,

635
00:35:55,155 --> 00:35:58,245
Speaker 9:  Cool. Stop. So yeah, that was kind of cool. That was right. Well, and

636
00:35:58,245 --> 00:35:59,885
Speaker 2:  I'm even happier that you get this one now.

637
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:03,645
Speaker 9:  Yes, this is, yeah, I mean it was, it's an

638
00:36:03,825 --> 00:36:07,765
Speaker 9:  ai you know, today it's a, basically I said a Jarvis in a car with

639
00:36:08,215 --> 00:36:11,925
Speaker 9:  every kind of technology you could possibly want. And every sort of scenario

640
00:36:13,055 --> 00:36:17,005
Speaker 9:  night rider got himself into the car, could come to the

641
00:36:17,005 --> 00:36:20,765
Speaker 9:  rescue. And it was also, I think the thing I liked most

642
00:36:20,775 --> 00:36:24,365
Speaker 9:  about Kit, which is sort of what you mentioned about Jarvis too, is that

643
00:36:24,425 --> 00:36:27,965
Speaker 9:  it was very funny and dry witted and would kind of,

644
00:36:28,305 --> 00:36:31,285
Speaker 9:  you know, sort of say, David you're being stupid

645
00:36:32,055 --> 00:36:33,405
Speaker 19:  Buddy. To investigate.

646
00:36:33,665 --> 00:36:34,725
Speaker 20:  To investigate what?

647
00:36:34,915 --> 00:36:37,485
Speaker 19:  Well, if I knew that they wouldn't have to investigate. Now what

648
00:36:37,745 --> 00:36:38,565
Speaker 20:  You call that logic,

649
00:36:39,025 --> 00:36:40,005
Speaker 19:  You got a better idea.

650
00:36:41,665 --> 00:36:43,125
Speaker 20:  How would you like to hear a little music?

651
00:36:46,115 --> 00:36:47,605
Speaker 2:  Yeah, kit's a good picture because also

652
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:51,285
Speaker 9:  Michael. Michael, it was Michael Knight. Sorry. That's right. David Hasselhoff

653
00:36:51,305 --> 00:36:54,085
Speaker 9:  played Michael Knight. Michael you're being stupid.

654
00:36:55,455 --> 00:36:58,525
Speaker 9:  Sorry, all my name's getting mixed up here. This is a good one. But

655
00:36:58,525 --> 00:37:01,605
Speaker 2:  Yes, it was also just a sick car. It could do, it was a car, everything.

656
00:37:01,885 --> 00:37:05,565
Speaker 2:  A car you needed to do it, it could go in the water. It looked awesome.

657
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:09,685
Speaker 2:  It would go really fast. It was just like, you would want it just as a

658
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:13,605
Speaker 2:  car. Yes. But then also it was also like a, a cool kind

659
00:37:13,605 --> 00:37:15,485
Speaker 2:  of obnoxious AI best friend.

660
00:37:16,155 --> 00:37:19,845
Speaker 9:  Very obnoxious, but very cool. And there was the gold pendant, which is

661
00:37:20,585 --> 00:37:23,445
Speaker 9:  the other really cool thing. So, so eighties.

662
00:37:24,395 --> 00:37:28,125
Speaker 9:  Yeah, but the, he had the gold pendant. He could just like, if he was in

663
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:31,645
Speaker 9:  real danger, he could just press the gold pendant and kit would come. Oh,

664
00:37:31,645 --> 00:37:32,165
Speaker 9:  it was so cool.

665
00:37:32,265 --> 00:37:34,805
Speaker 2:  And I think all this comes with the car, right? Like when you buy the car

666
00:37:34,805 --> 00:37:36,605
Speaker 2:  Yes. You get all the access. The dealership ship is definitely like throwing

667
00:37:36,605 --> 00:37:39,165
Speaker 2:  in the full package the watch and the pendant as the accessories. Yes.

668
00:37:39,445 --> 00:37:43,125
Speaker 9:  Yeah. And you know, paired with my Tardis, I mean I'm like,

669
00:37:43,305 --> 00:37:47,165
Speaker 9:  I'm set for life. I can do everything I need to go

670
00:37:47,325 --> 00:37:51,125
Speaker 9:  anywhere I want and have my AI companion come to my

671
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:54,725
Speaker 9:  rescue. When, when I'm in those awkward situations that my

672
00:37:54,725 --> 00:37:56,125
Speaker 9:  neuralizer is not gonna help me with.

673
00:37:57,145 --> 00:38:00,965
Speaker 2:  Can can kit fit in the TARDIS by the rules of the tardis? Can you bring Kit

674
00:38:00,965 --> 00:38:01,245
Speaker 2:  with you?

675
00:38:01,585 --> 00:38:03,285
Speaker 9:  Yes, I think you can. Okay,

676
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:04,005
Speaker 2:  Well

677
00:38:04,245 --> 00:38:07,525
Speaker 8:  I can, you can, I can borrow a you can borrow a capsule just to sit

678
00:38:08,095 --> 00:38:09,085
Speaker 8:  there you go the

679
00:38:09,085 --> 00:38:10,085
Speaker 9:  Target into my pocket

680
00:38:10,115 --> 00:38:12,245
Speaker 8:  Capsule and then fit it into the tardis so

681
00:38:12,505 --> 00:38:16,445
Speaker 2:  You can put the capsule in my giant pockets more

682
00:38:16,445 --> 00:38:20,365
Speaker 2:  room, everything. Bingo in Mia's pockets. Mia ends this

683
00:38:20,585 --> 00:38:24,085
Speaker 2:  the most powerful, just by virtue of having giant pockets. That's, that's

684
00:38:24,085 --> 00:38:28,005
Speaker 2:  definitely how. Alright Jen, you're up next. But first let's take a

685
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:30,885
Speaker 2:  break and then we're gonna do, that's two rounds. We got three more to do.

686
00:38:31,335 --> 00:38:33,245
Speaker 2:  We're coming right back to you Jen. We'll be right back.

687
00:41:33,705 --> 00:41:37,205
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back round three. Jen, you're up again.

688
00:41:37,705 --> 00:41:39,285
Speaker 2:  How do you feel? You ready? You got this one.

689
00:41:39,685 --> 00:41:41,605
Speaker 9:  I, I think I'm gonna have to go with Rosie.

690
00:41:42,635 --> 00:41:42,925
Speaker 2:  Okay.

691
00:41:43,435 --> 00:41:45,325
Speaker 9:  Just because I know just because

692
00:41:45,505 --> 00:41:47,565
Speaker 2:  You're doing the old head picks here. I love this for you.

693
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:52,365
Speaker 9:  Yeah, that's, you know, kit and Ro, Rosie and

694
00:41:53,115 --> 00:41:57,045
Speaker 9:  Star Trek. Were all, you know, that's why I became a tech journalist. So

695
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:01,365
Speaker 9:  I gotta follow the theme And I would've gone for Jarvis because I wanted

696
00:42:01,425 --> 00:42:05,325
Speaker 9:  Jarvis to be my housekeeper, not Rosie. Hmm. Just 'cause I want to buck the

697
00:42:05,605 --> 00:42:08,885
Speaker 9:  societal trends here. I don't think Rosie should necessarily have to be a

698
00:42:08,885 --> 00:42:12,805
Speaker 9:  woman. I agree. She as a household robot and Jarvis is

699
00:42:12,805 --> 00:42:14,205
Speaker 9:  just a bit hotter too. So

700
00:42:15,485 --> 00:42:18,925
Speaker 2:  I mean, I I did get Paul Beney, so like I got that going for me. Explain,

701
00:42:18,925 --> 00:42:22,045
Speaker 2:  explain Rosie's deal for, for folks who have not seen the Jetsons.

702
00:42:22,155 --> 00:42:26,125
Speaker 9:  Okay, so Rosie is a household robot. And actually

703
00:42:26,125 --> 00:42:29,645
Speaker 9:  in the early sort of days of the Jetsons, it was rather,

704
00:42:29,985 --> 00:42:33,325
Speaker 9:  it wasn't that good. In fact, one of the, the stories around it was that

705
00:42:33,515 --> 00:42:37,365
Speaker 9:  they couldn't afford the more expensive fancy model. So they had

706
00:42:37,365 --> 00:42:40,365
Speaker 9:  like the older model. But still Rosie can do a lot,

707
00:42:40,915 --> 00:42:42,405
Speaker 9:  Rosie's basically a humanoid

708
00:42:44,015 --> 00:42:47,765
Speaker 9:  robot that can, and on a, on wheels that can kind of roll

709
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:51,485
Speaker 9:  around the house and act like a housekeeper, maid,

710
00:42:51,615 --> 00:42:55,365
Speaker 9:  nanny doing, you know, all the chores that you might need. Because

711
00:42:55,635 --> 00:42:59,525
Speaker 9:  I've spent a lot of time with robots in my home over the, over the last few

712
00:42:59,525 --> 00:43:03,245
Speaker 9:  years. And the one thing I've realized that a robot really does need is

713
00:43:03,435 --> 00:43:06,845
Speaker 9:  some form of arms and limbs to do things for you.

714
00:43:07,345 --> 00:43:10,845
Speaker 9:  If you're going to have a humanoid type robot in your home that's going to

715
00:43:11,475 --> 00:43:15,285
Speaker 9:  fold your laundry or empty your dishwasher, you need

716
00:43:15,295 --> 00:43:18,325
Speaker 9:  limbs. And Rosie has little claw like limbs.

717
00:43:19,165 --> 00:43:22,525
Speaker 9:  This is why I wanted Jarvis because, you know, it looks like an actual person

718
00:43:22,745 --> 00:43:26,525
Speaker 9:  as opposed to Rosie does kind of look like pieces of scrap metal put

719
00:43:26,685 --> 00:43:30,525
Speaker 9:  together. But, but still it's, it, it works, it

720
00:43:30,545 --> 00:43:33,765
Speaker 9:  it, it gets the job done and that's what I need. I want something to,

721
00:43:34,505 --> 00:43:38,285
Speaker 9:  you know, do the laundry and put the clothes away and empty the dishwasher.

722
00:43:38,445 --> 00:43:41,245
Speaker 9:  'cause I have not yet figured out how to get anyone else in my house to do

723
00:43:41,245 --> 00:43:42,085
Speaker 9:  that for me. So

724
00:43:43,595 --> 00:43:47,405
Speaker 9:  some version of a Rosie I would like in my future, although I am

725
00:43:47,685 --> 00:43:51,485
Speaker 9:  slightly terrified of the, as much as I find the appendage

726
00:43:51,485 --> 00:43:53,685
Speaker 9:  is useful, I'm also slightly terrified of them. Yeah.

727
00:43:53,825 --> 00:43:57,685
Speaker 2:  So I'm curious in your, in your day to day as a smart home reporter, how

728
00:43:57,685 --> 00:44:01,565
Speaker 2:  often would you say Rosie the robot comes up? Because I feel like Rosie is

729
00:44:01,565 --> 00:44:05,085
Speaker 2:  one of the like canonical Yeah. Smart home things that

730
00:44:05,085 --> 00:44:06,845
Speaker 2:  everybody is always trying to build.

731
00:44:07,955 --> 00:44:11,845
Speaker 9:  Yeah, it is. It's very, and it's kind of tired from that

732
00:44:11,845 --> 00:44:15,725
Speaker 9:  perspective. It's like, it's what we're holding so much up against.

733
00:44:15,865 --> 00:44:19,005
Speaker 9:  But it's also, I mean, we've had so much technology from

734
00:44:19,945 --> 00:44:23,845
Speaker 9:  TV and movies and popular culture come to reality because

735
00:44:24,145 --> 00:44:28,125
Speaker 9:  it actually does help push people forward and invent things. And I feel

736
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:31,405
Speaker 9:  like there's a lot of things we have in our homes today because of Rosie

737
00:44:31,405 --> 00:44:35,365
Speaker 9:  because people are trying to make Rosie. That's why we have robot vacuum

738
00:44:35,365 --> 00:44:39,205
Speaker 9:  cleaners. You know, I'm not, I mean, I'm sure I know

739
00:44:39,225 --> 00:44:43,045
Speaker 9:  for a fact that that's like some of the idea behind the original

740
00:44:43,655 --> 00:44:46,685
Speaker 9:  robot vacuum was we want to make something that's gonna be helpful like a

741
00:44:46,685 --> 00:44:50,205
Speaker 9:  Rosie. So in that respect, I think, you know, she

742
00:44:50,545 --> 00:44:53,125
Speaker 9:  is in the smart home Hall of fame and always will be

743
00:44:55,245 --> 00:44:58,685
Speaker 2:  V you're up next. What, okay, what Dragon Ball Z thing are you gonna subject

744
00:44:58,685 --> 00:44:59,325
Speaker 2:  us to this time?

745
00:44:59,835 --> 00:45:03,725
Speaker 8:  It's not, it's not Dragon Ball Z this time, but I do think

746
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:06,165
Speaker 8:  I'm, the rest of my picks are a bit more

747
00:45:07,395 --> 00:45:11,285
Speaker 8:  obscure. Okay. So I'm gonna go with the one that I think is least obscure

748
00:45:11,945 --> 00:45:15,285
Speaker 8:  and it is the Babelfish from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

749
00:45:16,265 --> 00:45:20,005
Speaker 24:  It feeds on brainwave energy absorbing unconscious

750
00:45:20,005 --> 00:45:23,805
Speaker 24:  frequencies and excreting a matrix of conscious frequencies to the speech

751
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:27,725
Speaker 24:  centers of the brain. The practical upshot of which is that if

752
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,885
Speaker 24:  you stick one in your ear, you instantly understand

753
00:45:31,685 --> 00:45:33,845
Speaker 24:  anything said to you in any language.

754
00:45:34,845 --> 00:45:38,495
Speaker 8:  Because I spent a lot of my life studying various

755
00:45:38,895 --> 00:45:42,695
Speaker 8:  languages and v's brain it heri it tired. There are no

756
00:45:42,695 --> 00:45:46,615
Speaker 8:  room for anything besides English now. So I would like

757
00:45:46,695 --> 00:45:50,335
Speaker 8:  a little fish, little fish friend that translates everybody for me. So that

758
00:45:50,335 --> 00:45:53,615
Speaker 8:  when I translate, when I go on a plane and decide to

759
00:45:54,255 --> 00:45:58,095
Speaker 8:  torture myself on the way to ww DC watching Emelia Perez, I

760
00:45:58,095 --> 00:46:01,775
Speaker 8:  don't have to squint my eyes reading the horrible translations.

761
00:46:02,275 --> 00:46:05,975
Speaker 8:  You know, even though maybe I shouldn't have known what was being

762
00:46:06,175 --> 00:46:09,975
Speaker 8:  sung in that horrible ass movie. That's my review of Amelia Perez. Why

763
00:46:10,135 --> 00:46:12,415
Speaker 8:  I don know why I decided I don't, I don't,

764
00:46:13,095 --> 00:46:16,775
Speaker 14:  I can't tell you why I got the full recap from V after she saw it

765
00:46:17,075 --> 00:46:19,015
Speaker 14:  on our walk to Dunking Donuts.

766
00:46:19,855 --> 00:46:23,295
Speaker 8:  I was on a street reenacting the film for Allison

767
00:46:23,795 --> 00:46:25,895
Speaker 8:  and having a meltdown while doing it. But

768
00:46:26,035 --> 00:46:29,055
Speaker 2:  That's when Allison decided she wanted the neuralizer. She's like, I can't,

769
00:46:29,595 --> 00:46:30,055
Speaker 2:  I'm done with this,

770
00:46:30,285 --> 00:46:31,735
Speaker 14:  This exact situation.

771
00:46:32,805 --> 00:46:36,775
Speaker 8:  Basically. Yeah, no, no. I was watching a bunch of movies on

772
00:46:36,775 --> 00:46:40,455
Speaker 8:  the plane that were foreign language. I don't know why I decided. No, actually

773
00:46:40,455 --> 00:46:43,495
Speaker 8:  I do know why. 'cause my husband does not like reading subtitles.

774
00:46:45,075 --> 00:46:48,895
Speaker 8:  So this is very per, like I said, all my pics are selfish. I wanna be able

775
00:46:48,895 --> 00:46:52,815
Speaker 8:  to watch movies and not have him complain about subtitles and just

776
00:46:52,815 --> 00:46:56,615
Speaker 8:  have the direct translation. 'cause I wanted to watch eczema,

777
00:46:56,855 --> 00:47:00,775
Speaker 8:  a Korean horror movie last year, And I had

778
00:47:00,775 --> 00:47:04,695
Speaker 8:  to do it on a plane And I kept getting interrupted by the pilot giving safety

779
00:47:04,695 --> 00:47:08,095
Speaker 8:  information, like just let me die if the plane crashes and

780
00:47:08,095 --> 00:47:12,055
Speaker 8:  interrupting plots stuff. So I would've really liked the Babelfish at

781
00:47:12,055 --> 00:47:13,175
Speaker 8:  that point in time. So,

782
00:47:13,175 --> 00:47:16,135
Speaker 2:  Okay, wait, let me, let me just quickly make sure I understand the case you're

783
00:47:16,135 --> 00:47:19,975
Speaker 2:  making here. Yes. You would like this thing, which if, if memory serves from

784
00:47:19,975 --> 00:47:23,855
Speaker 2:  Hitchhiker's guy is a literal fish you shove into your ear. Yes. Correct.

785
00:47:24,005 --> 00:47:27,775
Speaker 2:  That real time translates all languages to all languages, right? Yes. That's,

786
00:47:27,775 --> 00:47:30,885
Speaker 2:  that's okay. A literal fish that you've shoved in your ear,

787
00:47:32,025 --> 00:47:36,005
Speaker 2:  you want it so you can watch horrible Netflix movies without subtitles. That's

788
00:47:36,005 --> 00:47:36,925
Speaker 2:  your, that's your whole

789
00:47:37,415 --> 00:47:41,205
Speaker 8:  Whole deal here. That's one was one use case. Also talking to my family because

790
00:47:41,285 --> 00:47:45,205
Speaker 8:  I am the Korean CCA in my family. I speak English, they speak Korean, and

791
00:47:45,205 --> 00:47:48,525
Speaker 8:  somehow we understand each other except like there's always like a word or

792
00:47:48,525 --> 00:47:51,685
Speaker 8:  two that I'm like, hmm. Context can't math out that meaning.

793
00:47:52,485 --> 00:47:56,125
Speaker 8:  So I would like that for, for those situations. And I'd like it for when

794
00:47:56,125 --> 00:47:59,285
Speaker 8:  I travel to other places in which I have not studied the language and have

795
00:47:59,285 --> 00:48:03,245
Speaker 8:  no intention to do Duolingo my ass into any form

796
00:48:03,265 --> 00:48:06,845
Speaker 8:  of dday, esta la Biblioteca and or whatever.

797
00:48:06,995 --> 00:48:10,885
Speaker 8:  Like, and like I would keep Fred in his own little tank and we

798
00:48:10,885 --> 00:48:14,565
Speaker 8:  would be friends and you know, he, I would have a very

799
00:48:14,565 --> 00:48:18,445
Speaker 8:  equitable life situation for Fred. Like, I, I just don't want an

800
00:48:18,585 --> 00:48:22,085
Speaker 8:  AI because like the, the, the appeal of the Babelfish

801
00:48:22,665 --> 00:48:26,485
Speaker 8:  is that he's gonna be able to translate my cousin's kid when she

802
00:48:26,485 --> 00:48:29,405
Speaker 8:  says skip bitty toilet as to what the fuck that means.

803
00:48:30,385 --> 00:48:34,085
Speaker 8:  So, and that can be translated into all languages because

804
00:48:34,225 --> 00:48:37,805
Speaker 8:  the problem with current AI translators is that and there shit

805
00:48:38,185 --> 00:48:41,725
Speaker 8:  at slang. Correct. And so it is use, I wanna talk to the teenagers and all

806
00:48:41,725 --> 00:48:45,605
Speaker 8:  these different languages and be like, please brain dump upon me your

807
00:48:45,605 --> 00:48:48,805
Speaker 8:  horrors. I would love to learn more about them. And

808
00:48:49,665 --> 00:48:53,605
Speaker 8:  the language barrier is they, they continually contort

809
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:57,405
Speaker 8:  language into new ways And I I need the babelfish to, to do that for me.

810
00:48:58,025 --> 00:49:01,565
Speaker 2:  All right. Fair enough. Weird that it's a fish. Like it's a real bummer that

811
00:49:01,565 --> 00:49:04,765
Speaker 2:  all of us now have to shove a fish in our ears to make this work. Listen,

812
00:49:05,505 --> 00:49:05,965
Speaker 2:  but Sure.

813
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:07,445
Speaker 8:  Listen, it's

814
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:11,125
Speaker 2:  Whatever. It's cute. Whatever works for you. Yeah, I like it. Mia, you're

815
00:49:11,125 --> 00:49:11,245
Speaker 2:  up.

816
00:49:11,975 --> 00:49:15,265
Speaker 7:  Okay. I have an old head pick, so you guys will appreciate it.

817
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:20,785
Speaker 7:  My pick are, I'm also like not that young,

818
00:49:20,965 --> 00:49:22,025
Speaker 7:  So I don't know why I said that.

819
00:49:22,595 --> 00:49:25,225
Speaker 2:  We're all in our seventies. It's important to know except for m

820
00:49:25,895 --> 00:49:29,465
Speaker 7:  Yeah, my emotional age is very old. My pick are

821
00:49:29,765 --> 00:49:33,665
Speaker 7:  the glasses from they live. If

822
00:49:33,665 --> 00:49:37,225
Speaker 7:  anyone has seen that movie, they are sort of like glasses that have been

823
00:49:37,255 --> 00:49:41,105
Speaker 7:  created to when you put them on, you see

824
00:49:41,195 --> 00:49:44,145
Speaker 7:  which of the people around you are aliens

825
00:49:45,135 --> 00:49:48,745
Speaker 7:  with evil, evil goals and all

826
00:49:48,975 --> 00:49:52,425
Speaker 7:  like ads or magazines. Like, it wakes you up to

827
00:49:52,885 --> 00:49:56,705
Speaker 7:  big advertising and like propaganda. So you'll look at

828
00:49:56,705 --> 00:49:59,585
Speaker 7:  an ad, you'll put the glasses on and you'll look at an ad and it says like,

829
00:49:59,815 --> 00:50:03,785
Speaker 7:  obey. That's actually where the Obey streetwear logo comes from.

830
00:50:03,845 --> 00:50:07,785
Speaker 7:  Oh. Or it will, you know, you'll look at

831
00:50:07,785 --> 00:50:10,625
Speaker 7:  like a magazine and it says like, no independent thought.

832
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:15,825
Speaker 7:  And I, I don't need the glasses. I think

833
00:50:15,905 --> 00:50:19,825
Speaker 7:  other people need them. Wow. So I would get a bunch of glasses and give

834
00:50:19,825 --> 00:50:23,625
Speaker 7:  them to people. And actually I, if I can brag for a second,

835
00:50:23,845 --> 00:50:27,645
Speaker 7:  the reason I picked the glasses is because I did a story last

836
00:50:27,645 --> 00:50:31,325
Speaker 7:  year about all the ways that people like changed their websites to

837
00:50:31,325 --> 00:50:34,565
Speaker 7:  appease Google. And it was like a step by step. Here are all the reasons.

838
00:50:35,025 --> 00:50:38,965
Speaker 7:  And the novelist, Colson Whitehead shared my story and

839
00:50:38,965 --> 00:50:42,725
Speaker 7:  said reading this was like putting on the they live glasses. Nice.

840
00:50:43,385 --> 00:50:47,125
Speaker 7:  So I I'm chasing that high all

841
00:50:47,265 --> 00:50:51,125
Speaker 7:  the time. And yeah, I'm giving these glasses out to a lot of people. Let's

842
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:51,485
Speaker 7:  just say that

843
00:50:52,445 --> 00:50:55,485
Speaker 2:  I like them as glasses because it also implies you can take them off and

844
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:58,925
Speaker 2:  go back to living in like blissful ignorance, which feels important. Like

845
00:50:59,105 --> 00:51:02,685
Speaker 2:  yes, I both do and don't want to know how the world really works. You know

846
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:06,645
Speaker 2:  what I mean? Yeah. It's like sometimes I do and then sometimes I would like

847
00:51:06,645 --> 00:51:08,805
Speaker 2:  to just go home and be

848
00:51:08,805 --> 00:51:12,565
Speaker 7:  Fine. Yeah. I mean, I would like, I would like them to tell

849
00:51:12,985 --> 00:51:16,885
Speaker 7:  me who is lying in a way. Like, I,

850
00:51:17,005 --> 00:51:20,205
Speaker 7:  I, this is so nerdy, I wanna know what is like un

851
00:51:20,805 --> 00:51:24,285
Speaker 7:  unidentified spun con. This is so boring.

852
00:51:24,715 --> 00:51:28,365
Speaker 2:  What if it, what if you put these glasses on and it turns out that like all

853
00:51:28,365 --> 00:51:31,485
Speaker 2:  of the conspiracy theories that we've made fun of on the internet actually

854
00:51:31,485 --> 00:51:32,805
Speaker 2:  turn out to be true. It could

855
00:51:32,805 --> 00:51:34,245
Speaker 7:  Like, could be Oh, no. Good to know.

856
00:51:34,885 --> 00:51:36,805
Speaker 2:  Would rather know. Yeah. You just put them on and it's just instantly like

857
00:51:36,985 --> 00:51:39,205
Speaker 2:  the Illuminati everywhere and you're like, oh my God. They were right.

858
00:51:39,755 --> 00:51:43,045
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It could be. I'm willing to take that chance, but like I said, I don't

859
00:51:43,045 --> 00:51:45,565
Speaker 7:  think I'll be wearing them that much. I'm gonna give them to people who need

860
00:51:45,565 --> 00:51:45,685
Speaker 7:  them.

861
00:51:48,155 --> 00:51:50,885
Speaker 7:  It's like media literacy in a, in a, in a wearable

862
00:51:50,885 --> 00:51:51,925
Speaker 14:  Form factor. Exactly. Yeah.

863
00:51:51,925 --> 00:51:54,885
Speaker 2:  You're like a pastor on a street corner, but you're handing out glasses basically.

864
00:51:56,945 --> 00:51:57,965
Speaker 14:  Not sketchy at all.

865
00:51:59,075 --> 00:52:02,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Here, wear these. You'll see the truth. Like that's, that's gonna go

866
00:52:02,045 --> 00:52:02,405
Speaker 2:  great for

867
00:52:02,405 --> 00:52:04,765
Speaker 7:  Everybody. Yeah. No, that's exactly it. That's exactly it.

868
00:52:05,395 --> 00:52:09,045
Speaker 2:  Okay. I like this. Allison, you're up next.

869
00:52:09,785 --> 00:52:12,925
Speaker 14:  All right. I'm gonna stay in the realm of film

870
00:52:14,425 --> 00:52:15,125
Speaker 14:  and go with

871
00:52:17,165 --> 00:52:21,135
Speaker 14:  dinosaur embryos, but only the

872
00:52:21,135 --> 00:52:24,455
Speaker 14:  ones that eat plants. So Jurassic Park could

873
00:52:24,455 --> 00:52:27,935
Speaker 2:  Be, hold on. Is this, are we, is this technology? Are we, are we gonna allow

874
00:52:27,935 --> 00:52:28,535
Speaker 2:  this as

875
00:52:28,535 --> 00:52:32,215
Speaker 14:  Technology? Because it's the, here's the exact technology, David, thank

876
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:35,535
Speaker 14:  you for asking. It's the barbasol can. The

877
00:52:35,655 --> 00:52:39,255
Speaker 14:  barbasol can, that Atu has, that has

878
00:52:39,515 --> 00:52:42,815
Speaker 14:  the embryos inside of it. So if you have that,

879
00:52:43,435 --> 00:52:47,375
Speaker 14:  you, I mean, you have to like, I don't know how to turn a dinosaur embryo

880
00:52:47,445 --> 00:52:50,575
Speaker 14:  into a baby dinosaurs. I'll pay someone to figure that out.

881
00:52:51,475 --> 00:52:55,415
Speaker 14:  So I'm starting with a bible. So can, and I'm gonna take out the,

882
00:52:55,595 --> 00:52:59,575
Speaker 14:  the embryos for the Velociraptors and the T-Rex, And I'm gonna throw

883
00:52:59,575 --> 00:53:03,335
Speaker 14:  those away. We don't need that chaos, and we're just gonna have

884
00:53:03,395 --> 00:53:07,375
Speaker 14:  the nice dinosaurs and they can like live in the

885
00:53:07,375 --> 00:53:09,055
Speaker 14:  zoo and it'll be great.

886
00:53:10,535 --> 00:53:12,095
Speaker 7:  I feel like famously that's not great.

887
00:53:13,275 --> 00:53:16,455
Speaker 2:  You're just describing the first act of Jurassic Park, and then it all goes

888
00:53:16,455 --> 00:53:16,735
Speaker 2:  wrong.

889
00:53:16,835 --> 00:53:20,575
Speaker 14:  If you, if you forget, I'm gonna use the neuralizer on

890
00:53:21,515 --> 00:53:24,295
Speaker 14:  myself. Forget everything I learned from Jurassic Park.

891
00:53:25,275 --> 00:53:29,005
Speaker 14:  Just have the, the cute, nice dinosaurs. Maybe I'll make 'em a little

892
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:30,645
Speaker 14:  smaller. They don't need to be so

893
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:30,885
Speaker 9:  Big.

894
00:53:31,885 --> 00:53:32,125
Speaker 8:  I mean,

895
00:53:32,355 --> 00:53:33,765
Speaker 2:  This is how it starts, Alison.

896
00:53:34,205 --> 00:53:37,605
Speaker 8:  They have feathers. I mean, they'll have feathers. They'll be cute. It might

897
00:53:37,605 --> 00:53:41,525
Speaker 8:  be, we had a bunch of new birds, like new, new kinds of chickens.

898
00:53:41,905 --> 00:53:42,125
Speaker 8:  Oh.

899
00:53:42,425 --> 00:53:46,365
Speaker 9:  I'd much rather have dinosaurs than, what are the, the rats?

900
00:53:46,505 --> 00:53:49,765
Speaker 9:  The wooly mammoth rats. They've just recreated. Oh. Oh, let's bring back

901
00:53:50,005 --> 00:53:50,405
Speaker 9:  dinosaurs.

902
00:53:50,675 --> 00:53:52,285
Speaker 14:  Yeah. Yeah. Let's bring

903
00:53:52,285 --> 00:53:55,045
Speaker 9:  Back dinosaurs. I'm, I'm with Allison on this one. I want, I want dinosaur.

904
00:53:55,045 --> 00:53:56,685
Speaker 9:  They want chicken dinosaurs. I, chicken

905
00:53:56,925 --> 00:54:00,845
Speaker 8:  Dinosaurs. I, they're like chicken sized or, or like, if, if we can have

906
00:54:00,845 --> 00:54:01,845
Speaker 8:  them in miniature,

907
00:54:02,415 --> 00:54:04,565
Speaker 14:  Maybe we could put a size lemon on it.

908
00:54:05,805 --> 00:54:09,645
Speaker 2:  I think like, if you can't hold it in two hands, it's too big

909
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,405
Speaker 9:  Life. We'll find a way, Allison. Yes,

910
00:54:12,755 --> 00:54:13,245
Speaker 14:  Exactly.

911
00:54:15,075 --> 00:54:18,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah. We just, this is, this is the beginning of, of Jurassic Park. We just

912
00:54:18,805 --> 00:54:19,885
Speaker 2:  did it. Everybody Congrat.

913
00:54:19,885 --> 00:54:21,045
Speaker 14:  Congratulations. Yeah.

914
00:54:21,715 --> 00:54:23,845
Speaker 2:  Jeff Goldblum is gonna be here any minute. Yeah.

915
00:54:24,985 --> 00:54:25,205
Speaker 14:  Be

916
00:54:25,205 --> 00:54:27,205
Speaker 2:  Good to go. We're gonna make a lot of money and then it's all gonna fall

917
00:54:27,205 --> 00:54:30,205
Speaker 2:  apart. And I think that's fine. We're, we're gonna get really rich along

918
00:54:30,205 --> 00:54:30,685
Speaker 2:  the way. Yep.

919
00:54:32,595 --> 00:54:35,285
Speaker 2:  Dang. Wow. That is not where I expect you just, okay. This is good.

920
00:54:36,665 --> 00:54:40,645
Speaker 2:  All right. I get two now. I spend a lot of time, I don't know if this is

921
00:54:40,645 --> 00:54:42,965
Speaker 2:  a thing any of you spent time thinking about. I spent a lot of time thinking

922
00:54:42,965 --> 00:54:46,885
Speaker 2:  about contact lenses because this is a thing that comes up in a lot

923
00:54:46,885 --> 00:54:50,645
Speaker 2:  of movies and TV shows. Various David, they like skip

924
00:54:50,715 --> 00:54:54,485
Speaker 2:  past, you know, AR glasses and they go right to contact lenses

925
00:54:54,585 --> 00:54:55,485
Speaker 2:  to do various things.

926
00:54:57,695 --> 00:55:01,515
Speaker 2:  I have landed on the contact lenses from the movie

927
00:55:01,515 --> 00:55:05,275
Speaker 2:  Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol, which is not the

928
00:55:05,505 --> 00:55:08,995
Speaker 2:  best of the Mission Impossible movies. But

929
00:55:09,025 --> 00:55:12,955
Speaker 2:  basically these contact lenses have two features that I like very much.

930
00:55:13,375 --> 00:55:16,915
Speaker 2:  One is facial recognition, which frankly I could take or leave. Like

931
00:55:17,985 --> 00:55:21,835
Speaker 2:  Neli always says that his great thing for AR glasses is like, tell him who

932
00:55:21,835 --> 00:55:25,075
Speaker 2:  everybody is. That's fine. He can have that. What I want is the other feature,

933
00:55:25,245 --> 00:55:28,635
Speaker 2:  which is essentially just a, a text scanner

934
00:55:28,855 --> 00:55:32,725
Speaker 2:  camera for photographing documents in your day-to-day life. And

935
00:55:32,745 --> 00:55:35,925
Speaker 2:  I'm just thinking, for me, as someone with a truly

936
00:55:36,325 --> 00:55:40,005
Speaker 2:  godawful memory, I just, I'm just, I'm just running around taking

937
00:55:40,005 --> 00:55:42,805
Speaker 2:  pictures of everything forever. This is like, this is the greatest camera

938
00:55:42,995 --> 00:55:46,365
Speaker 2:  I've ever had. I can remember all the documents that I see. I'd have to spend

939
00:55:46,365 --> 00:55:50,325
Speaker 2:  a lot less time like transcribing stuff out of my camera roll. This is

940
00:55:50,395 --> 00:55:54,285
Speaker 2:  Pure like a work device for me that is just my

941
00:55:54,285 --> 00:55:57,765
Speaker 2:  text scanner for everything all the time. And then I'm gonna just pipe it

942
00:55:57,765 --> 00:56:00,445
Speaker 2:  into Apple reminders and just remember everything that ever happens to me

943
00:56:00,575 --> 00:56:04,125
Speaker 14:  We're so boring. That was my crazy question. Like when you wanna

944
00:56:04,185 --> 00:56:08,045
Speaker 14:  recall it, what do you see? Does it appear in front of your eyes or what?

945
00:56:08,745 --> 00:56:12,085
Speaker 2:  That's a good question. I think I just tell Jarvis this is, this is what

946
00:56:12,085 --> 00:56:13,285
Speaker 2:  I, this is what I do. I'm

947
00:56:13,285 --> 00:56:16,805
Speaker 8:  Curious why the contact lens form factor, because

948
00:56:17,495 --> 00:56:21,165
Speaker 8:  ostensibly one of the many smart glasses across many

949
00:56:21,645 --> 00:56:25,565
Speaker 8:  franchises of sci-fi would also be able to do

950
00:56:25,565 --> 00:56:27,965
Speaker 8:  this for you. Like why the contact lenses? I

951
00:56:27,965 --> 00:56:30,765
Speaker 2:  Just, I, so as somebody who does not wear glasses or contacts,

952
00:56:32,325 --> 00:56:35,765
Speaker 2:  I feel like I would get used to contacts faster than I would get used to

953
00:56:35,765 --> 00:56:39,685
Speaker 2:  glasses. And please disabuse me of this notion if I

954
00:56:39,685 --> 00:56:43,005
Speaker 2:  am wrong. But I think the idea of like, I'm just gonna have this sort of

955
00:56:43,005 --> 00:56:46,605
Speaker 2:  on and with me all day. I think contact lenses would annoy me less, which

956
00:56:46,605 --> 00:56:47,925
Speaker 2:  is my whole reason for choosing this.

957
00:56:48,115 --> 00:56:49,485
Speaker 8:  Your eyes gonna get so

958
00:56:49,545 --> 00:56:52,205
Speaker 9:  Dry. Yeah. By the end of the day. So dry.

959
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:56,085
Speaker 8:  They're gonna be so dry. You're gonna be wishing you a glasses.

960
00:56:56,435 --> 00:56:56,725
Speaker 9:  Yeah.

961
00:56:57,105 --> 00:57:00,245
Speaker 2:  I'm gonna like beta test one of these and go blind is basically what's gonna

962
00:57:00,245 --> 00:57:02,125
Speaker 2:  happen. But you might be right.

963
00:57:02,225 --> 00:57:04,685
Speaker 9:  Is this like photographic memory though? Is that kind of,

964
00:57:04,685 --> 00:57:06,245
Speaker 2:  It's essentially photographic memory.

965
00:57:06,355 --> 00:57:08,205
Speaker 9:  It's that I'm definitely down with, yeah.

966
00:57:08,735 --> 00:57:12,045
Speaker 2:  Recallable photographic memory Yes. Is essentially what these give you. And

967
00:57:12,045 --> 00:57:12,525
Speaker 2:  I'm extremely

968
00:57:12,635 --> 00:57:16,165
Speaker 8:  Here for it. Listen, did, did, did most of us not covet the neur? Because

969
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:18,005
Speaker 8:  remembering everything is painful.

970
00:57:18,675 --> 00:57:20,365
Speaker 9:  It's a curse. Yeah.

971
00:57:20,995 --> 00:57:24,085
Speaker 2:  Yeah. But in this world, I get to have a neuralizer anyway, So I'm just,

972
00:57:24,105 --> 00:57:26,645
Speaker 2:  I'm just constantly fairness, constantly calibrating fairness of remembering

973
00:57:26,645 --> 00:57:28,045
Speaker 2:  and forgetting everything as I want to.

974
00:57:29,705 --> 00:57:33,595
Speaker 2:  So I'm taking that one. And then I'm, there's a lot, there's a

975
00:57:33,595 --> 00:57:37,475
Speaker 2:  lot more possibilities here. I'm gonna take for my next pick

976
00:57:38,315 --> 00:57:42,255
Speaker 2:  the portal gun from Rick and Morty. I don't know if any

977
00:57:42,255 --> 00:57:46,095
Speaker 2:  of you have watched Rick and Morty, but basically the portal gun

978
00:57:46,545 --> 00:57:50,415
Speaker 2:  opens up portals to parallel universes and sometimes they know where

979
00:57:50,415 --> 00:57:53,615
Speaker 2:  they're going and sometimes they don't. And it's pure chaos. It is just like

980
00:57:53,615 --> 00:57:57,535
Speaker 2:  an nonstop adventure machine. And you have the gun that can

981
00:57:57,535 --> 00:58:01,455
Speaker 2:  get you to another parallel universe. But also you can use a

982
00:58:01,455 --> 00:58:05,415
Speaker 2:  portal to get back. And I just think as somebody who spends a lot

983
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:09,335
Speaker 2:  of time sitting here in my basement on Google meet, talking to

984
00:58:09,335 --> 00:58:13,175
Speaker 2:  people, it would be really nice to just be able to like turn around and

985
00:58:13,175 --> 00:58:16,455
Speaker 2:  just like hit up a parallel universe for 20 minutes between meetings. And

986
00:58:16,455 --> 00:58:17,055
Speaker 2:  that feels great.

987
00:58:17,205 --> 00:58:20,655
Speaker 9:  There's a lot of escape in lot of want to escape lot. Yeah. I was gonna say,

988
00:58:21,815 --> 00:58:24,655
Speaker 9:  I think we need a vacation. Yes. That might be right.

989
00:58:25,965 --> 00:58:27,495
Speaker 9:  Just go to the beach. Yeah.

990
00:58:27,515 --> 00:58:31,135
Speaker 2:  And it's, you know, I can see some stuff, broaden my horizons, try new things,

991
00:58:31,355 --> 00:58:34,335
Speaker 2:  but then I can always come back. There's just a, I just open up a portal

992
00:58:34,335 --> 00:58:36,695
Speaker 2:  right here in the basement. Nobody even knows I'm gone.

993
00:58:37,405 --> 00:58:39,505
Speaker 9:  But you might go somewhere scary. You don't know.

994
00:58:39,735 --> 00:58:43,425
Speaker 2:  Sometimes. Sometimes it is scary and sometimes, sometimes

995
00:58:43,425 --> 00:58:47,105
Speaker 2:  that's, I think I also probably have to have Rick with me for this. Okay.

996
00:58:47,105 --> 00:58:51,025
Speaker 2:  So I think I'm like bringing the portal gun, but I'm also hiring

997
00:58:51,655 --> 00:58:55,545
Speaker 2:  Rick, who is like an insane alcoholic grandpa to come

998
00:58:55,545 --> 00:58:58,465
Speaker 2:  accompany me on these adventures. I'm signing up to be Morty in all of these

999
00:58:58,465 --> 00:59:00,185
Speaker 2:  adventures is what I'm realizing as I say

1000
00:59:00,215 --> 00:59:01,185
Speaker 8:  What a choice. Choice.

1001
00:59:01,285 --> 00:59:04,985
Speaker 2:  I'm the pathetic sidekick who almost dies over and over, but always has an

1002
00:59:04,985 --> 00:59:06,705
Speaker 2:  adventure. And I think I'm ready for that. Oh geez, Rick.

1003
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:07,745
Speaker 9:  It's just

1004
00:59:07,745 --> 00:59:09,105
Speaker 8:  You the entire time. That's

1005
00:59:09,105 --> 00:59:12,945
Speaker 2:  Me. Yeah. This is, this is the life I'm after. So Yeah, I'm taking the

1006
00:59:12,945 --> 00:59:16,825
Speaker 2:  portal gun. I think I don't wanna, like, time travel has like

1007
00:59:16,885 --> 00:59:20,785
Speaker 2:  too many consequences for me. I think like if we're, if we're opening

1008
00:59:20,785 --> 00:59:24,085
Speaker 2:  up the T Tartus get, just send me to apparel universe. I can't cause any

1009
00:59:24,085 --> 00:59:25,365
Speaker 2:  trouble in apparel universe. It's fine.

1010
00:59:26,825 --> 00:59:30,525
Speaker 14:  But yeah, but I, I, what is, what are you getting outta

1011
00:59:30,555 --> 00:59:30,845
Speaker 14:  this

1012
00:59:31,375 --> 00:59:32,045
Speaker 2:  Adventures?

1013
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:33,245
Speaker 14:  Okay, that's it.

1014
00:59:33,545 --> 00:59:34,605
Speaker 2:  That's, that's the the beauty.

1015
00:59:34,605 --> 00:59:35,325
Speaker 7:  He wants to feel alive.

1016
00:59:35,625 --> 00:59:39,085
Speaker 2:  I'm gonna learn things. I'm gonna see new creatures. I'm gonna try new stuff.

1017
00:59:39,345 --> 00:59:43,085
Speaker 2:  But fundamentally then I feel like I get to come back And I haven't,

1018
00:59:43,305 --> 00:59:46,245
Speaker 2:  if I went back to like the tutors with you and the tardis, I'm gonna be like,

1019
00:59:46,245 --> 00:59:49,045
Speaker 2:  well, I can't do anything or else I might screw up the future forever. I

1020
00:59:49,045 --> 00:59:52,725
Speaker 2:  don't wanna do that. I get to just go to some weird cartoon

1021
00:59:53,165 --> 00:59:55,085
Speaker 2:  universe and then come back. No states. Oh, it's

1022
00:59:55,085 --> 00:59:55,605
Speaker 7:  All cartoons.

1023
00:59:56,195 --> 00:59:59,405
Speaker 2:  Well, and Rick and Morty, it's all cartoons. Presumably my version of it

1024
00:59:59,405 --> 00:59:59,845
Speaker 2:  would be real.

1025
01:00:00,405 --> 01:00:02,725
Speaker 7:  I don dunno. I don know if you can make that call. Maybe

1026
01:00:02,725 --> 01:00:05,605
Speaker 2:  It's all cartoons. If it's all cartoons, I'm even more in And I should have

1027
01:00:05,605 --> 01:00:06,285
Speaker 2:  picked the super, that

1028
01:00:06,285 --> 01:00:07,205
Speaker 14:  Kind of rules. Yeah.

1029
01:00:09,995 --> 01:00:13,755
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I, this, that's my, that's this could go horribly wrong, but I feel

1030
01:00:13,755 --> 01:00:15,875
Speaker 2:  good about it. I'm taking this pick. Alison, you're up.

1031
01:00:16,425 --> 01:00:20,075
Speaker 14:  Okay. In the vein of like little buddies,

1032
01:00:20,555 --> 01:00:24,315
Speaker 14:  I guess I'm picking the movie theater from

1033
01:00:24,315 --> 01:00:27,875
Speaker 14:  Mystery Science Theater 3000. And what that

1034
01:00:27,905 --> 01:00:30,555
Speaker 14:  entails is my little robot friends,

1035
01:00:32,135 --> 01:00:36,025
Speaker 14:  you know, Daisy Gypsy, Tom Servo,

1036
01:00:36,285 --> 01:00:39,945
Speaker 14:  all those guys we're gonna sit and watch movies

1037
01:00:40,205 --> 01:00:43,785
Speaker 14:  and have a good time. And it, it's like you could go there when you want

1038
01:00:43,925 --> 01:00:47,905
Speaker 14:  and like watch a bad old movie with your robot friends and then leave,

1039
01:00:47,955 --> 01:00:51,785
Speaker 14:  which was not part of the premise of mystery science here. 3000. You were

1040
01:00:51,785 --> 01:00:55,065
Speaker 14:  stuck there forever. But in, in my version,

1041
01:00:55,605 --> 01:00:56,425
Speaker 14:  you can come and go.

1042
01:00:56,895 --> 01:01:00,425
Speaker 2:  This is so wholesome. Yeah. You're just like, I just wanna watch movies with

1043
01:01:00,425 --> 01:01:01,105
Speaker 2:  my robot friends. I

1044
01:01:01,105 --> 01:01:04,905
Speaker 14:  Wanna hang out with my robot buddies. I have so many good memories of MST.

1045
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:09,525
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Are you, are you on the show by virtue of being in the theater?

1046
01:01:10,045 --> 01:01:10,165
Speaker 2:  I

1047
01:01:10,165 --> 01:01:13,045
Speaker 14:  Think you're just kind of along for the ride. Like you don't have to make

1048
01:01:13,045 --> 01:01:16,735
Speaker 14:  any jokes or anything. Okay. You're just listening to the jokes

1049
01:01:17,115 --> 01:01:20,585
Speaker 14:  and it's fun and nice. And then there's a project

1050
01:01:20,855 --> 01:01:24,745
Speaker 14:  they always do like a weird little thing in betwe, like in

1051
01:01:24,745 --> 01:01:28,465
Speaker 14:  between segments where they're like, now we're doing a craft or

1052
01:01:28,705 --> 01:01:31,745
Speaker 14:  whatever. It, it sounds like preschool. And

1053
01:01:32,985 --> 01:01:34,865
Speaker 14:  I, I guess I just wanna go back to preschool

1054
01:01:36,795 --> 01:01:40,745
Speaker 7:  Again with the escapism. Like you can go anywhere, anywhere, But here

1055
01:01:41,645 --> 01:01:44,225
Speaker 7:  my big pockets and the ability to go anywhere.

1056
01:01:44,525 --> 01:01:45,425
Speaker 14:  That's basically,

1057
01:01:46,615 --> 01:01:50,225
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I, I I love it. I have no notes on this. This is the lowest stakes

1058
01:01:50,225 --> 01:01:54,025
Speaker 2:  one yet, by a mile. Yeah. And I'm very happy about this. This causes no societal

1059
01:01:54,025 --> 01:01:57,985
Speaker 2:  problems. Nothing, nothing bad happens. You've just created like a new

1060
01:01:57,985 --> 01:02:00,625
Speaker 2:  movie theater for a bunch of people to go to. Yeah. That is slightly more

1061
01:02:00,625 --> 01:02:01,545
Speaker 2:  fun and there's a lot

1062
01:02:01,545 --> 01:02:02,825
Speaker 14:  There. But most importantly for me,

1063
01:02:04,745 --> 01:02:06,905
Speaker 2:  I love it. This is great. Mia, you're up.

1064
01:02:07,295 --> 01:02:11,225
Speaker 7:  Okay. A lot of people are gonna be mad at me because I think, I think this

1065
01:02:11,225 --> 01:02:14,785
Speaker 7:  could be vetoed. I would like the

1066
01:02:14,945 --> 01:02:18,425
Speaker 7:  doorknob that Josie Packer and Twin Peaks get stuck in.

1067
01:02:20,785 --> 01:02:22,325
Speaker 2:  Wow. No part of that went where

1068
01:02:22,325 --> 01:02:23,805
Speaker 8:  I thought I was supposed to have not seen

1069
01:02:23,995 --> 01:02:26,405
Speaker 7:  Twin Peak. What? Wait.

1070
01:02:26,535 --> 01:02:27,525
Speaker 8:  Store Nob, please

1071
01:02:27,525 --> 01:02:31,285
Speaker 7:  Explain. Haven it yet this have, have people seen Twin Peaks? Okay.

1072
01:02:31,745 --> 01:02:35,405
Speaker 7:  In Twin Peaks there is like the wealthy wife of a

1073
01:02:35,555 --> 01:02:38,125
Speaker 7:  mill owner and she

1074
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:43,125
Speaker 7:  gets stuck in a doorknob and it's just never really resolved.

1075
01:02:43,255 --> 01:02:47,245
Speaker 7:  She's just in there and it's a doorknob at like a random,

1076
01:02:47,605 --> 01:02:51,085
Speaker 7:  I don't think there's anything special about the doorknob, but her face is

1077
01:02:51,085 --> 01:02:54,885
Speaker 7:  in there. And I think the last we see of her is she's kind of like Ahm in

1078
01:02:54,885 --> 01:02:58,445
Speaker 7:  the doorknob and like, you know, con confuse let me out. But

1079
01:02:58,965 --> 01:03:02,805
Speaker 7:  I would use it to trap my enemies. I'm gonna be, so, for real, I'm,

1080
01:03:02,805 --> 01:03:06,445
Speaker 7:  there's nothing deeper. I'm putting, I'm putting you bitches in the doorknob.

1081
01:03:06,485 --> 01:03:07,685
Speaker 7:  I don't know if I can say that on this podcast.

1082
01:03:07,985 --> 01:03:10,165
Speaker 2:  You absolutely can't. That might be the title of this podcast. What

1083
01:03:10,165 --> 01:03:10,485
Speaker 8:  Did we do?

1084
01:03:11,745 --> 01:03:15,485
Speaker 7:  Not you guys. Okay. But my, my Enemies, you know what I mean? And

1085
01:03:15,575 --> 01:03:18,525
Speaker 7:  trust me right now, a lot of people would be in that door kn a bit. You

1086
01:03:18,525 --> 01:03:22,125
Speaker 8:  Know what? I trust Mia's judgment. I give her full

1087
01:03:22,275 --> 01:03:25,925
Speaker 8:  authority to just trap her enemy. 'cause I feel like Mia's enemies

1088
01:03:26,465 --> 01:03:30,325
Speaker 8:  by and large are Ities enemies. So I fully trust her

1089
01:03:30,345 --> 01:03:33,085
Speaker 8:  to trap these bitches in the doorknob.

1090
01:03:34,405 --> 01:03:37,285
Speaker 7:  I don dunno if it's a technology, I'm gonna say it is. Oh, that

1091
01:03:37,285 --> 01:03:40,925
Speaker 9:  Was gonna be my question. 'cause I did watch some of Twin Peaks, but I don't

1092
01:03:41,085 --> 01:03:44,805
Speaker 9:  remember the doorknob. And how did, do we know how she got in there?

1093
01:03:44,805 --> 01:03:48,725
Speaker 9:  Like was there technology involved in putting her in there or was it, I mean,

1094
01:03:48,725 --> 01:03:51,085
Speaker 9:  there was no rhyme nor reason to Twin Peaks really was there.

1095
01:03:51,115 --> 01:03:55,005
Speaker 2:  This is such a good edge case because you're, you're, it, it both isn't technology

1096
01:03:55,065 --> 01:03:58,765
Speaker 2:  and is also completely unexplainable by any other means.

1097
01:03:59,275 --> 01:04:02,965
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So I think I have to give this to you because I can't refute it. Like

1098
01:04:03,115 --> 01:04:03,405
Speaker 2:  it's

1099
01:04:03,405 --> 01:04:06,725
Speaker 7:  Not Yeah. Someone, someone had to invent the doorknob eventually. Like the

1100
01:04:06,725 --> 01:04:09,445
Speaker 7:  doorknob generally I would say is a technology.

1101
01:04:10,565 --> 01:04:14,245
Speaker 2:  I mean, that's, boy, that's a, that's a great case. I mean, thank you. I

1102
01:04:14,245 --> 01:04:17,125
Speaker 2:  also, can we just like quickly psychoanalyze Mia for a second here

1103
01:04:18,065 --> 01:04:21,725
Speaker 2:  in, in two consecutive picks has said, I'm going to fix society by giving

1104
01:04:21,725 --> 01:04:24,925
Speaker 2:  them real glasses and I'm gonna trap bitches in a doorknob. Like,

1105
01:04:26,305 --> 01:04:29,485
Speaker 2:  are we, do you have some, do you have some thoughts about the public we should

1106
01:04:29,485 --> 01:04:30,045
Speaker 2:  talk about here

1107
01:04:30,145 --> 01:04:33,885
Speaker 7:  For a few minutes? No, I contain multitudes. I both believe in

1108
01:04:34,085 --> 01:04:37,925
Speaker 7:  everyone's ability to be better and some people need to be in a timeout in

1109
01:04:37,925 --> 01:04:39,245
Speaker 7:  a doorknob. This

1110
01:04:39,245 --> 01:04:40,925
Speaker 8:  Is the smart door lock that we need.

1111
01:04:41,345 --> 01:04:42,645
Speaker 7:  I'm just, I was,

1112
01:04:42,725 --> 01:04:44,045
Speaker 9:  I was gonna give that, but yeah, yeah,

1113
01:04:44,355 --> 01:04:48,245
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And if we, if it existed now, you know, ring Doorbell would

1114
01:04:48,245 --> 01:04:51,645
Speaker 7:  be integrating that shit immediately. Oh yeah. Immediately

1115
01:04:52,265 --> 01:04:54,925
Speaker 2:  You go in the doorknob ring calls the cops like

1116
01:04:55,075 --> 01:04:57,725
Speaker 7:  Immediately. Yeah. People, people would want it for like, the people who

1117
01:04:57,725 --> 01:05:00,645
Speaker 7:  steal Amazon packages, you know what I mean? Like, people would be up in

1118
01:05:00,645 --> 01:05:04,565
Speaker 7:  arms being like, Amazon package thieves into the doorknob. You get sucked

1119
01:05:04,795 --> 01:05:07,765
Speaker 7:  into the doorknob if you steal packages.

1120
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:13,645
Speaker 2:  All right, we'll, we'll allow it. It's, it's, it's sketchy, but we'll, we'll

1121
01:05:13,645 --> 01:05:15,325
Speaker 2:  allow it. Ve you're up next.

1122
01:05:15,795 --> 01:05:19,205
Speaker 8:  It's extremely hard to follow up the doorknob gel,

1123
01:05:20,945 --> 01:05:24,325
Speaker 8:  but I think I'm gonna go with the sonic screwdriver from Dr. Who

1124
01:05:24,595 --> 01:05:28,485
Speaker 8:  because that's good choice. This is also kind of a cheaty device in the

1125
01:05:28,485 --> 01:05:32,205
Speaker 8:  sense that it is a plot hole filler little

1126
01:05:32,205 --> 01:05:36,125
Speaker 2:  Bit Dr. Who's kinda lazy this way. I'm discovering there's just like that

1127
01:05:36,125 --> 01:05:37,685
Speaker 2:  can do everything bit. You'll, you, you figure it out.

1128
01:05:37,985 --> 01:05:41,725
Speaker 8:  But here's how the laziness suits me And I think society at large

1129
01:05:42,045 --> 01:05:45,765
Speaker 8:  because the, so like, if you've never watched Doctor Who the doctor

1130
01:05:45,825 --> 01:05:49,525
Speaker 8:  has a bunch of little doodads and gadgets, and one of them is the sonic screwdriver.

1131
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:52,725
Speaker 8:  It is like, it's like a pen with a little light out in the end. It goes b

1132
01:05:53,545 --> 01:05:57,405
Speaker 8:  or whatnot. And anytime the writers have written him into a plot corner,

1133
01:05:57,945 --> 01:06:01,645
Speaker 8:  he uses the sonic screwdriver and it gets him out of it. Such that,

1134
01:06:01,745 --> 01:06:05,285
Speaker 8:  so like a door's locked, Sonic screwdriver opens the door

1135
01:06:05,585 --> 01:06:09,445
Speaker 8:  Gadget broke all It's fixed again. Oh, I don't know. I

1136
01:06:09,445 --> 01:06:13,005
Speaker 8:  don't know what it's happening. There you go. So it's sort of like a

1137
01:06:13,015 --> 01:06:16,965
Speaker 8:  diagnostic tool and a Swiss Army knife fix-it gun.

1138
01:06:17,385 --> 01:06:21,365
Speaker 8:  Not, not like, or like, you know, it, it has like spiritually, I think

1139
01:06:21,365 --> 01:06:24,925
Speaker 8:  it's very close to a Tide pen in that like, oh no,

1140
01:06:25,585 --> 01:06:29,485
Speaker 8:  here's this thing that's that's, that's horrible. Let me just

1141
01:06:29,635 --> 01:06:33,285
Speaker 8:  pull out this little pen thing. Oh, it's fixed again. So like,

1142
01:06:34,225 --> 01:06:38,125
Speaker 8:  if you can imagine like spiritually a, a digital

1143
01:06:38,675 --> 01:06:42,485
Speaker 8:  Tide pen, but instead of being limited to stains,

1144
01:06:42,625 --> 01:06:46,485
Speaker 8:  it can like, it can diagnose what's wrong with your computer. It

1145
01:06:46,485 --> 01:06:50,285
Speaker 8:  can fix a lock that's broken. It can just,

1146
01:06:50,285 --> 01:06:54,085
Speaker 8:  like, I, I hate home maintenance, So I would love to take my little

1147
01:06:54,085 --> 01:06:57,165
Speaker 8:  screwdriver and go and be like, tell me what's wrong with my toilet.

1148
01:06:57,905 --> 01:07:01,285
Speaker 8:  Oh, the thing I, I'm not a plumber. I don't know what's wrong with the toilet

1149
01:07:01,285 --> 01:07:02,605
Speaker 2:  Thing. The thing what plumber say? I think

1150
01:07:02,845 --> 01:07:05,805
Speaker 8:  This is the, the, the thing is broken and then you just point at, at again,

1151
01:07:05,845 --> 01:07:09,085
Speaker 8:  I go all my toilets fixed, save $2,000 in,

1152
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:13,605
Speaker 8:  in plumbing bills. Like this is, this is what I want a little diagnostic

1153
01:07:13,865 --> 01:07:14,525
Speaker 8:  fix it tool.

1154
01:07:14,875 --> 01:07:17,805
Speaker 2:  It's also small, which I really appreciate about the song. Yeah. Screwdriver.

1155
01:07:17,915 --> 01:07:20,165
Speaker 2:  It's not, I don't have to figure out where to put a phone booth in my house.

1156
01:07:20,685 --> 01:07:23,125
Speaker 2:  This is just like a thing I have in a drawer that solves all my problems.

1157
01:07:23,315 --> 01:07:26,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I think it's a good one. I like it very much. All right, Jen, back

1158
01:07:26,805 --> 01:07:28,125
Speaker 2:  to you. You get two in a row.

1159
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:29,245
Speaker 9:  Oh my goodness.

1160
01:07:29,505 --> 01:07:32,685
Speaker 2:  But these are your last two. Okay. So don't blow this, Jen.

1161
01:07:35,225 --> 01:07:39,205
Speaker 9:  So I, I have one very obvious one and one not so

1162
01:07:39,205 --> 01:07:42,365
Speaker 9:  obvious one. And they're quite connected. So I'm, I'm, I'm happy about this.

1163
01:07:44,035 --> 01:07:47,925
Speaker 9:  This I'm going with because I couldn't not do a Star Trek pick.

1164
01:07:48,725 --> 01:07:50,845
Speaker 9:  I am going with the replicator. Damn it.

1165
01:07:52,075 --> 01:07:53,325
Speaker 2:  That was gonna be my last pick.

1166
01:07:53,865 --> 01:07:54,885
Speaker 9:  And for Mia,

1167
01:07:56,485 --> 01:07:57,045
Speaker 9:  I would explain,

1168
01:07:57,735 --> 01:07:58,765
Speaker 8:  Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

1169
01:07:58,785 --> 01:08:01,285
Speaker 9:  For the Youngs because I don't think anyone else listening to this podcast

1170
01:08:01,435 --> 01:08:02,885
Speaker 9:  will need, will

1171
01:08:02,885 --> 01:08:04,925
Speaker 8:  Need the God, my God, I'm sorry.

1172
01:08:06,545 --> 01:08:09,605
Speaker 9:  But the Star Trek replicator is a computer

1173
01:08:10,555 --> 01:08:14,525
Speaker 9:  that on Star Trek spaceships, these are 'cause Star trek's

1174
01:08:14,525 --> 01:08:18,485
Speaker 9:  set in space where you can create pretty

1175
01:08:18,485 --> 01:08:21,965
Speaker 9:  much anything you like. So you go up to replicator, you

1176
01:08:22,385 --> 01:08:23,485
Speaker 9:  say in famously

1177
01:08:24,045 --> 01:08:24,845
Speaker 25:  TL, gray Hot

1178
01:08:27,725 --> 01:08:30,565
Speaker 25:  TL, gray, hot TL, gray Hot

1179
01:08:31,605 --> 01:08:32,605
Speaker 25:  L, gray Tea Hot,

1180
01:08:33,225 --> 01:08:37,125
Speaker 9:  And you get tea, hot L Gray. You can

1181
01:08:37,125 --> 01:08:40,965
Speaker 9:  also create anything you need any inanimate

1182
01:08:41,025 --> 01:08:44,005
Speaker 9:  matter as long as it was in the computer's

1183
01:08:44,905 --> 01:08:48,735
Speaker 9:  brain and its programming. So food, basically, this is how they

1184
01:08:48,895 --> 01:08:52,855
Speaker 9:  ate on ships and it create anything you wanted. So I

1185
01:08:52,855 --> 01:08:56,615
Speaker 9:  have my robot helper and then I have my replicator in my kitchen that can

1186
01:08:56,615 --> 01:08:59,255
Speaker 9:  just basically do anything I need. I don't, I no longer need to go to the

1187
01:08:59,255 --> 01:09:03,215
Speaker 9:  shops. No grocery shopping for me. I can just get

1188
01:09:03,695 --> 01:09:07,295
Speaker 9:  whatever I need from my replicator. Is there anything it can't make? Yeah,

1189
01:09:07,315 --> 01:09:10,735
Speaker 9:  so it can create, it, it's limited to what it knows about

1190
01:09:11,115 --> 01:09:15,095
Speaker 9:  inside its machine memory. And it

1191
01:09:15,095 --> 01:09:18,895
Speaker 9:  couldn't make like, some things that were gonna save the ship so that

1192
01:09:18,895 --> 01:09:22,855
Speaker 9:  there was a plot line, like when they needed like,

1193
01:09:22,855 --> 01:09:26,135
Speaker 9:  some kind of weird material. It would be something that the, you know, to

1194
01:09:26,135 --> 01:09:29,775
Speaker 9:  save the ship to like, so Scotty could fix the engines

1195
01:09:30,045 --> 01:09:33,015
Speaker 9:  that he needed and it couldn't replicate that because then there would be

1196
01:09:33,015 --> 01:09:33,655
Speaker 9:  no plot left.

1197
01:09:35,235 --> 01:09:39,215
Speaker 9:  But it also, what was very cool about it is that it, it could recycle

1198
01:09:39,555 --> 01:09:43,295
Speaker 9:  it, it recycled things. So it recycled matter already on the ship

1199
01:09:43,565 --> 01:09:47,215
Speaker 9:  into what you created, what you asked it for. So that

1200
01:09:47,355 --> 01:09:51,255
Speaker 9:  was, I mean, a little gross depending on what is recycling and

1201
01:09:51,255 --> 01:09:54,815
Speaker 9:  what you are eating, but very eco-friendly, which I think is a good

1202
01:09:54,885 --> 01:09:57,015
Speaker 9:  feature for our new tech.

1203
01:09:57,415 --> 01:10:00,655
Speaker 2:  I think one of the things it did was like provide air, right? That it was

1204
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:03,575
Speaker 2:  like, it, it's, that's you get infinite, breathable air out of the replicator.

1205
01:10:03,685 --> 01:10:06,295
Speaker 2:  It's like that. We might, we might need that. We

1206
01:10:06,375 --> 01:10:07,415
Speaker 9:  Do need that right now. That's

1207
01:10:07,415 --> 01:10:09,855
Speaker 8:  I'm saying So like a 3D printer on steroids.

1208
01:10:10,685 --> 01:10:14,095
Speaker 9:  Yeah. Yes, it is a 3D printer on steroids. So yeah, the replicator, it's,

1209
01:10:14,095 --> 01:10:18,055
Speaker 9:  it's, it's a, a predictable one I'm afraid. But we can't not have

1210
01:10:18,055 --> 01:10:18,175
Speaker 9:  it.

1211
01:10:18,455 --> 01:10:21,175
Speaker 2:  I was gonna pick it. I was hoping I would get it last in the draft because

1212
01:10:21,355 --> 01:10:23,775
Speaker 2:  you know, all these losers don't even know what Star Trek is, so

1213
01:10:25,085 --> 01:10:27,415
Speaker 2:  Oops. What can you do? All right, we're gonna get to the very last round,

1214
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:29,775
Speaker 2:  but let's take one more break before we do. We'll be right back.

1215
01:12:20,715 --> 01:12:23,775
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Jen, you again? Okay, last round.

1216
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:28,615
Speaker 9:  So my replicator was my last pick and then

1217
01:12:28,715 --> 01:12:32,415
Speaker 9:  my to round out my perfect kitchen and home

1218
01:12:32,565 --> 01:12:34,295
Speaker 9:  with my smart car and my

1219
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:37,015
Speaker 2:  You are just building the ultimate smart home for yourself. I'm realizing

1220
01:12:37,015 --> 01:12:40,095
Speaker 2:  this now. Like what if my job as a reporter was done?

1221
01:12:41,275 --> 01:12:45,055
Speaker 9:  Yes, exactly. Fixed all the problems. This one, I think I'm,

1222
01:12:45,325 --> 01:12:48,735
Speaker 9:  it's a, it's like a glimpse in the movie. It's only there very briefly,

1223
01:12:49,915 --> 01:12:53,775
Speaker 9:  but this is the fruit dispenser in

1224
01:12:53,775 --> 01:12:54,735
Speaker 9:  back to the future too.

1225
01:12:55,595 --> 01:12:56,735
Speaker 2:  Oh yeah.

1226
01:12:57,475 --> 01:13:01,215
Speaker 9:  It comes out from the ceiling and has freshly grown fruit

1227
01:13:01,605 --> 01:13:05,135
Speaker 9:  that you can eat it any time. I love that. And

1228
01:13:05,325 --> 01:13:09,055
Speaker 9:  yeah, So I would want that. Like if that, that's the one thing I, if my kitchen

1229
01:13:09,055 --> 01:13:12,295
Speaker 9:  could do for me. Just give me fresh fruit. That's really good because you

1230
01:13:12,295 --> 01:13:12,775
Speaker 9:  know, that's great.

1231
01:13:13,375 --> 01:13:16,295
Speaker 2:  I love it. It's like having a living wall, but it's fruit in your house,

1232
01:13:16,395 --> 01:13:20,375
Speaker 9:  You know? Yes, exactly. Gross bananas, right? No, nothing's gone

1233
01:13:20,675 --> 01:13:24,415
Speaker 9:  bad or rotten. You know, your strawberries aren't

1234
01:13:24,545 --> 01:13:28,135
Speaker 9:  moldy. Your bananas aren't inhabiting

1235
01:13:28,385 --> 01:13:31,455
Speaker 9:  fruit flies, which is what happens a lot where I live, I live in the south,

1236
01:13:31,675 --> 01:13:35,655
Speaker 9:  so ugh, there's so much gross stuff that happens to fruit and I have to eat

1237
01:13:35,655 --> 01:13:38,095
Speaker 9:  it within the day. I get it. And then, you know, I've eaten it all and there's

1238
01:13:38,095 --> 01:13:41,815
Speaker 9:  no fruit left by the end of the week. So I actually saw at

1239
01:13:42,015 --> 01:13:45,615
Speaker 9:  CES four or five, no, maybe even six years ago,

1240
01:13:46,035 --> 01:13:50,015
Speaker 9:  GE had like a futuristic growing garden kitchen like

1241
01:13:50,015 --> 01:13:53,415
Speaker 9:  this where it didn't have fruit, but like everything was sort of growing

1242
01:13:53,675 --> 01:13:57,575
Speaker 9:  in the kitchen using like recycled water from the dishwasher

1243
01:13:57,595 --> 01:14:01,495
Speaker 9:  and composting all doing it inside the kitchen. And

1244
01:14:01,495 --> 01:14:05,335
Speaker 9:  this kind of felt like the sort of the culmination of that where

1245
01:14:05,335 --> 01:14:08,415
Speaker 9:  you could just press a little button and down from the ceiling comes your

1246
01:14:08,415 --> 01:14:12,085
Speaker 9:  fresh, freshly grown fruit. So yes, that's my last

1247
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:15,885
Speaker 9:  piece of my, my ultimate sort of smart home, smart

1248
01:14:15,945 --> 01:14:19,645
Speaker 9:  car puzzle that I've put together here. I'm coming over for your fruit.

1249
01:14:20,025 --> 01:14:21,125
Speaker 9:  For the fruit. Yeah,

1250
01:14:21,865 --> 01:14:24,325
Speaker 2:  That's fine. We can all go over to Jen's house. Everything is taken care

1251
01:14:24,325 --> 01:14:27,285
Speaker 2:  of. So Jen's just gonna be mega chill about it. I know. It's not even a problem

1252
01:14:27,465 --> 01:14:31,125
Speaker 2:  to have lots of people over. This is great. Very true.

1253
01:14:31,525 --> 01:14:34,045
Speaker 2:  I like this very much. Jen, I have a really important question is, do you

1254
01:14:34,045 --> 01:14:37,885
Speaker 2:  think Matter makes all of this stuff work together over time or

1255
01:14:38,915 --> 01:14:42,645
Speaker 2:  like matter matter 2.6 is the one that really makes, makes

1256
01:14:42,825 --> 01:14:46,125
Speaker 2:  kit and the fruit dispenser perfectly integrated. Is that, does that, was

1257
01:14:46,125 --> 01:14:46,485
Speaker 2:  this gonna happen?

1258
01:14:47,315 --> 01:14:49,245
Speaker 9:  Matt? What did you say? Mats at 2.6 matter.

1259
01:14:49,345 --> 01:14:51,565
Speaker 2:  2.6. Goodness. Is that too ambitious? Maybe.

1260
01:14:51,995 --> 01:14:52,645
Speaker 9:  That might be

1261
01:14:54,505 --> 01:14:57,205
Speaker 2:  All right. I love it. V what's your last one?

1262
01:14:58,225 --> 01:15:02,085
Speaker 8:  Oof. I had so many backups that now I have to decide between

1263
01:15:02,345 --> 01:15:04,485
Speaker 8:  my selfish technology picks because,

1264
01:15:06,505 --> 01:15:10,445
Speaker 8:  but I think, I think after thinking about it, I have to go with

1265
01:15:10,625 --> 01:15:14,145
Speaker 8:  the remote from Seminole, Adam Sandler movie. Click

1266
01:15:15,005 --> 01:15:18,825
Speaker 8:  the Time Controlling Remote where you can fast forward through the most painful

1267
01:15:18,915 --> 01:15:22,545
Speaker 8:  parts of your life or rewind through some of them. You do

1268
01:15:22,545 --> 01:15:24,705
Speaker 2:  Know how this movie ends, right? You're doing a real Jurassic Park thing

1269
01:15:24,705 --> 01:15:27,065
Speaker 2:  where it's like, oh, in act one, this seems like a really good idea. And

1270
01:15:27,065 --> 01:15:29,225
Speaker 2:  then I turned off the movie like, no,

1271
01:15:29,465 --> 01:15:33,265
Speaker 8:  I would exclusively ba first of all, I haven't seen the movie,

1272
01:15:33,505 --> 01:15:35,665
Speaker 8:  I just know of this from the trailers,

1273
01:15:37,505 --> 01:15:41,265
Speaker 8:  whatever. Just the concept of of being able to

1274
01:15:41,335 --> 01:15:45,025
Speaker 8:  fast through forward through the worst parts of my meetings,

1275
01:15:45,425 --> 01:15:49,185
Speaker 8:  basically because I am an anti meeting person. Mainly

1276
01:15:49,455 --> 01:15:53,425
Speaker 8:  this isn't gonna be my soapbox because 90% of the meetings

1277
01:15:53,425 --> 01:15:57,225
Speaker 8:  that I have to sit through ain't worth it. There's like a

1278
01:15:57,225 --> 01:16:00,425
Speaker 8:  preamble. There's usually someone coming up and going, let me explain

1279
01:16:01,285 --> 01:16:04,905
Speaker 8:  points A through Z when really you, you only need points

1280
01:16:05,695 --> 01:16:09,505
Speaker 8:  like YNZ and then it's just like, oh Jesus Christ. And

1281
01:16:09,505 --> 01:16:12,265
Speaker 8:  like, you know, maybe this is just journalist specific. It

1282
01:16:12,265 --> 01:16:15,505
Speaker 2:  Feels important at this moment to tell everyone watching and listening that

1283
01:16:15,725 --> 01:16:19,505
Speaker 2:  the context here is that V had a two hour long meeting this morning

1284
01:16:19,505 --> 01:16:23,465
Speaker 2:  that she traveled to. That 100% should have been an email. It was, and

1285
01:16:23,465 --> 01:16:24,665
Speaker 2:  has been complaining about it all

1286
01:16:24,665 --> 01:16:28,545
Speaker 8:  Day. Thousand percent should have been an email. And if I,

1287
01:16:28,645 --> 01:16:32,385
Speaker 8:  it was one of those gotcha meetings where it's like they, they're like, eh,

1288
01:16:32,565 --> 01:16:35,505
Speaker 8:  you're gonna wanna know about the thing. And it's like, ah, fuck, I guess

1289
01:16:35,545 --> 01:16:38,505
Speaker 8:  I do wanna know about the thing. And then you show up and they're like,

1290
01:16:39,165 --> 01:16:42,995
Speaker 8:  here's the thing at the very end. And it's like you're,

1291
01:16:42,995 --> 01:16:46,515
Speaker 8:  you're just low, low hum screaming. This could have been an email in your

1292
01:16:46,515 --> 01:16:49,715
Speaker 8:  brain and you get why they wanted you to come out. They wanted everybody

1293
01:16:49,715 --> 01:16:53,655
Speaker 8:  to have a little fun, get to know everybody and that's great. But

1294
01:16:53,655 --> 01:16:57,575
Speaker 8:  not for me. Not for me specifically. I would've liked to

1295
01:16:57,605 --> 01:17:00,775
Speaker 8:  just go press the little button, go droop. And I was like, oh, magically

1296
01:17:00,795 --> 01:17:04,415
Speaker 8:  I'm done. I'm at the end of the meeting and they're emailing me all the

1297
01:17:04,575 --> 01:17:08,415
Speaker 8:  salient points anyway. So I really haven't

1298
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:12,165
Speaker 8:  missed anything. I just basically would love to fast forward through the

1299
01:17:12,165 --> 01:17:16,005
Speaker 8:  most painful parts of, I just wanna go through

1300
01:17:16,385 --> 01:17:19,685
Speaker 8:  the parts of life where it's just like, this could have been an email all

1301
01:17:19,685 --> 01:17:22,445
Speaker 8:  the times that you sit there and you go, this could have been an email just

1302
01:17:23,155 --> 01:17:23,445
Speaker 8:  done.

1303
01:17:23,625 --> 01:17:26,005
Speaker 2:  Jen, Alison, Mia. Have any of you seen, I've

1304
01:17:26,005 --> 01:17:29,845
Speaker 9:  Seen the movie And I remember it, how it ends badly, but I've forgotten

1305
01:17:29,955 --> 01:17:33,365
Speaker 9:  exactly what happens at the end. So David, you have to l lighten us

1306
01:17:33,385 --> 01:17:36,445
Speaker 2:  All. I would say not to spoil this movie for anyone who hasn't seen it, it's

1307
01:17:36,685 --> 01:17:40,005
Speaker 2:  actually very good. Watch it. Good people should watch it. It's, it's in

1308
01:17:40,025 --> 01:17:43,925
Speaker 2:  the like O of Adam Sandler movies that are surprisingly

1309
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:47,885
Speaker 2:  pretty good. Punch Trunk Love also a good movie. Oh, anyway. So

1310
01:17:47,885 --> 01:17:51,605
Speaker 2:  good. The point of click is that actually living your life is good.

1311
01:17:51,885 --> 01:17:53,045
Speaker 2:  I would say yes. And I think,

1312
01:17:54,005 --> 01:17:56,845
Speaker 7:  I believe that this is not the group to say that too. That's so sweet. Don't

1313
01:17:56,845 --> 01:17:57,405
Speaker 7:  say this to us.

1314
01:17:57,925 --> 01:18:01,005
Speaker 8:  I believe that I'm not, I'm not trying to normalize my life out of anything.

1315
01:18:01,365 --> 01:18:05,285
Speaker 8:  I am just saying in the context of useless meetings,

1316
01:18:05,605 --> 01:18:09,405
Speaker 8:  I see where we all wish we could just be out of the meeting room sooner.

1317
01:18:09,475 --> 01:18:11,605
Speaker 8:  Like I will sit through meetings that are important.

1318
01:18:11,825 --> 01:18:14,765
Speaker 2:  So you're thinking like, how do we take the click remote and turn it into

1319
01:18:14,765 --> 01:18:18,525
Speaker 2:  like B2B software that is only available through my HR

1320
01:18:18,845 --> 01:18:18,925
Speaker 2:  platform.

1321
01:18:19,025 --> 01:18:19,245
Speaker 8:  The

1322
01:18:19,245 --> 01:18:20,125
Speaker 2:  Skip meetings. Yeah.

1323
01:18:20,125 --> 01:18:23,845
Speaker 8:  Honest to God, I think it would make, 'cause you would just turn you, I think,

1324
01:18:23,925 --> 01:18:26,565
Speaker 8:  I think you could use it very threateningly. So I'm just gonna take this

1325
01:18:26,565 --> 01:18:29,245
Speaker 8:  as a thing where you're in a, you're in a meeting and you start taking out

1326
01:18:29,245 --> 01:18:32,485
Speaker 8:  the fricking click remote and all the PR people are just start, they start

1327
01:18:32,685 --> 01:18:36,565
Speaker 8:  sweating buckets. 'cause they know that their meeting sucks. And to, to,

1328
01:18:36,565 --> 01:18:39,285
Speaker 8:  to make sure that no one does this in the future. They'll go, oh, we gotta,

1329
01:18:39,285 --> 01:18:43,165
Speaker 8:  we gotta revolutionize how we do meetings every, every now and

1330
01:18:43,165 --> 01:18:46,885
Speaker 8:  then there's gonna be strict agendas of 30 minute cap. And then, you know,

1331
01:18:47,205 --> 01:18:50,445
Speaker 8:  I, I just think the threat of pulling out the mid, the, the, the, the remote

1332
01:18:50,955 --> 01:18:54,325
Speaker 8:  will make people think twice about how they're wasting your time. It's

1333
01:18:54,325 --> 01:18:54,805
Speaker 7:  Preventative.

1334
01:18:54,985 --> 01:18:56,125
Speaker 2:  All right. Mia, what's your last pick?

1335
01:18:56,755 --> 01:19:00,525
Speaker 7:  Okay. I had a hard time picking because Spy Kids

1336
01:19:00,785 --> 01:19:04,525
Speaker 7:  to me was like a formative text. I watch those movies

1337
01:19:05,305 --> 01:19:09,005
Speaker 7:  all the time and everything is cool and everything

1338
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:12,885
Speaker 7:  looks great Yep. In those movies. But in the end I went

1339
01:19:12,955 --> 01:19:16,445
Speaker 7:  with the most boring thing, which is the microwave that just makes food out

1340
01:19:16,445 --> 01:19:20,245
Speaker 7:  of like a packet. Hmm. I actually don't know if it's like the

1341
01:19:20,245 --> 01:19:24,005
Speaker 7:  microwave that I want or the food packets. Like I'm not sure which is

1342
01:19:24,245 --> 01:19:25,045
Speaker 7:  creating it. I think

1343
01:19:25,045 --> 01:19:28,045
Speaker 2:  I'll allow you to have both because if, if one exists, somebody's gonna make

1344
01:19:28,045 --> 01:19:31,125
Speaker 2:  the other. So I think, we'll we, we can, will both into existence here. Okay.

1345
01:19:31,125 --> 01:19:35,005
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So it looks like a, a package of popcorn like microwave popcorn and

1346
01:19:35,005 --> 01:19:38,925
Speaker 7:  you put it in and like hit the button and one second later it's like a

1347
01:19:38,925 --> 01:19:42,605
Speaker 7:  full meal on a plate and it looks really good. And I hate cooking.

1348
01:19:43,185 --> 01:19:46,925
Speaker 7:  My wor the worst part of my week that I have to do like every single week

1349
01:19:46,945 --> 01:19:47,925
Speaker 7:  is plan my lunch.

1350
01:19:49,505 --> 01:19:53,445
Speaker 7:  And I like this because like, I feel like a lot of sci-fi like meal replacement

1351
01:19:53,445 --> 01:19:57,405
Speaker 7:  things are like, you're taking a pill, right? And it's like the, your food.

1352
01:19:57,885 --> 01:20:01,605
Speaker 7:  I, I do wanna eat food. I like to eat. That's a normal thing to like,

1353
01:20:01,865 --> 01:20:04,085
Speaker 7:  And I don't wanna take a pill. I would like to spy kids food.

1354
01:20:04,255 --> 01:20:07,285
Speaker 2:  Right. You don't want the Soylent life. This

1355
01:20:07,285 --> 01:20:08,405
Speaker 9:  Does exist sort of

1356
01:20:08,555 --> 01:20:09,365
Speaker 2:  Does it really

1357
01:20:10,155 --> 01:20:13,645
Speaker 7:  Well, I guess like sort of microwave dinners a little bit.

1358
01:20:14,305 --> 01:20:17,685
Speaker 9:  So there's this, And I, I did review this that it's not quite as

1359
01:20:18,085 --> 01:20:21,965
Speaker 9:  futuristic as, but the Valla oven that I reviewed a while back, which

1360
01:20:21,965 --> 01:20:25,445
Speaker 9:  is like an oven that you have a subscription

1361
01:20:25,475 --> 01:20:29,445
Speaker 9:  service and they send you prepackaged meals and you

1362
01:20:29,445 --> 01:20:32,285
Speaker 9:  put them in the oven, but it doesn't cook it like a microwave oven. It cooks

1363
01:20:32,285 --> 01:20:36,205
Speaker 9:  it all like an oven, oven cook meal. And it tastes so much better

1364
01:20:36,525 --> 01:20:40,485
Speaker 9:  than a microwave meal. It's not quite as whiz bang as like, like

1365
01:20:40,505 --> 01:20:43,925
Speaker 9:  the freeze dried becomes like a whole four course meal. Yeah. But it it's

1366
01:20:43,925 --> 01:20:47,765
Speaker 9:  kind of cool. I liked it. Yeah. It's it's expensive though. Not

1367
01:20:47,785 --> 01:20:48,765
Speaker 9:  the oven but the

1368
01:20:48,765 --> 01:20:52,205
Speaker 7:  Food. Right. I also, I worry about having like a

1369
01:20:52,445 --> 01:20:56,325
Speaker 7:  subscription to my oven because so boring. That's,

1370
01:20:56,325 --> 01:20:59,325
Speaker 7:  that seems like the type of thing that would, like my oven would be secretly

1371
01:20:59,325 --> 01:21:02,685
Speaker 7:  mining Bitcoin or something. You know what I mean? I'm just like, I don't

1372
01:21:02,685 --> 01:21:03,325
Speaker 7:  wanna deal with this,

1373
01:21:03,985 --> 01:21:07,605
Speaker 2:  But I do like this. 'cause in this world, like seven 11

1374
01:21:07,715 --> 01:21:11,525
Speaker 2:  will sell you a bunch of these food packs you can go to,

1375
01:21:11,525 --> 01:21:14,245
Speaker 2:  if I remember right in my kids, one of the things they make is like a McDonald's

1376
01:21:14,245 --> 01:21:18,005
Speaker 2:  meal. Yeah. Out they get like a Big Mac out of the right. The the thing.

1377
01:21:18,725 --> 01:21:22,525
Speaker 2:  Right. So you can just, everywhere that will sell you food will also sell

1378
01:21:22,525 --> 01:21:25,285
Speaker 2:  you a packet and then you can just Yeah. Redo it yourself at home.

1379
01:21:25,595 --> 01:21:29,005
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And I like this, I just want everything from spy kids. Like the little

1380
01:21:29,675 --> 01:21:33,645
Speaker 7:  dragonfly submarine. Ugh, I wanted that so much when I was a

1381
01:21:33,645 --> 01:21:36,605
Speaker 7:  kid. Now I'm afraid Spy kid was awesome. Yeah. Now I'm afraid of submarines,

1382
01:21:36,705 --> 01:21:40,565
Speaker 7:  but that I want an army of thumbs that will do my

1383
01:21:40,565 --> 01:21:44,445
Speaker 7:  bidding. Oh, I need, I need that. That's where I'm

1384
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:46,205
Speaker 7:  escaping to. That's where I'm taking the tardis to

1385
01:21:46,875 --> 01:21:49,605
Speaker 2:  Just the world of spy kids. Yeah, you can come, I'll do the, I'll do the

1386
01:21:49,605 --> 01:21:53,285
Speaker 2:  portal gun to Yeah. The spy kids world and we'll just go hang out there together

1387
01:21:53,305 --> 01:21:56,685
Speaker 2:  and it'll be Exactly, it'll be awesome. I love that. Alison, what's your

1388
01:21:56,685 --> 01:21:57,165
Speaker 2:  last pick?

1389
01:21:58,185 --> 01:22:01,925
Speaker 14:  My last pick is just a chaos pick, which is Love it.

1390
01:22:02,305 --> 01:22:05,885
Speaker 14:  The trans modifier from Calvin and Hobbes. And

1391
01:22:06,545 --> 01:22:10,525
Speaker 14:  let me tell you what the trans modifier was. Okay. It was a cardboard

1392
01:22:10,585 --> 01:22:14,445
Speaker 14:  box. It's the invention of Calvin who's what, like five or six

1393
01:22:14,665 --> 01:22:15,485
Speaker 14:  or seven.

1394
01:22:17,105 --> 01:22:20,845
Speaker 14:  And it has a dial on the side and

1395
01:22:21,345 --> 01:22:25,285
Speaker 14:  it is a little arrow and you turn the arrow to the thing you

1396
01:22:25,285 --> 01:22:28,645
Speaker 14:  would like to, you put something in the box,

1397
01:22:29,255 --> 01:22:32,605
Speaker 14:  close it, turn the dial and it transforms into the, the thing that arrow's

1398
01:22:32,605 --> 01:22:36,325
Speaker 14:  pointing at. So the, the given examples are

1399
01:22:36,755 --> 01:22:39,485
Speaker 14:  like baboon eel.

1400
01:22:41,205 --> 01:22:42,365
Speaker 14:  I don't think I would go for those.

1401
01:22:44,065 --> 01:22:47,325
Speaker 14:  Calvin transforms himself into a tiger

1402
01:22:48,405 --> 01:22:51,965
Speaker 14:  and then he, but then he's just like a cute little version of Hobbes, which

1403
01:22:51,985 --> 01:22:55,725
Speaker 14:  was a funny bit. I think it would be funny.

1404
01:22:56,005 --> 01:22:59,885
Speaker 14:  I think I would turn like if I like was gonna put on a pair

1405
01:22:59,885 --> 01:23:03,565
Speaker 14:  of shoes and I'm like, oh, these don't look quite right. Put 'em in the

1406
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:07,525
Speaker 14:  transmogrify, change 'em to the shoes I want. Or like,

1407
01:23:07,735 --> 01:23:10,885
Speaker 14:  maybe it would work for food if I'm like, oh, this

1408
01:23:11,415 --> 01:23:14,445
Speaker 14:  isn't, this meal didn't come out the way I wanted. I could

1409
01:23:14,885 --> 01:23:18,805
Speaker 14:  transmogrify it to the one I did want. There's just

1410
01:23:18,805 --> 01:23:22,685
Speaker 14:  a lot of possibilities And I am, I'm willing to accept the

1411
01:23:22,685 --> 01:23:24,005
Speaker 14:  chaos that goes along with it.

1412
01:23:24,395 --> 01:23:26,965
Speaker 2:  Also very simple. 'cause it's just a cardboard box and a Yeah. And a knob

1413
01:23:26,965 --> 01:23:28,525
Speaker 2:  and you just kind of write on the side what it's

1414
01:23:28,525 --> 01:23:32,165
Speaker 14:  You write in. Yeah. Yeah. There's room to write in what you want.

1415
01:23:32,385 --> 01:23:34,685
Speaker 14:  So I, in addition to eel and baboon,

1416
01:23:36,865 --> 01:23:39,525
Speaker 14:  you just get a sharpie out and write it. It's

1417
01:23:39,525 --> 01:23:43,445
Speaker 2:  Pretty good. You, you have by definition between this and

1418
01:23:43,465 --> 01:23:47,005
Speaker 2:  and Jurassic Park, you have very possibly ruined the world forever. I

1419
01:23:47,005 --> 01:23:49,085
Speaker 14:  Could probably take over the world just between the two

1420
01:23:49,085 --> 01:23:50,645
Speaker 2:  Of those. You absolutely could.

1421
01:23:50,755 --> 01:23:54,285
Speaker 14:  Cute little dinosaurs and a transmogrify. Yeah.

1422
01:23:54,345 --> 01:23:57,245
Speaker 2:  You're gonna be essentially unstoppable. I'm good. Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

1423
01:23:57,245 --> 01:24:01,235
Speaker 2:  That's, that's pretty good. I like this for you. All right. I, I have

1424
01:24:01,235 --> 01:24:04,195
Speaker 2:  a lot to choose from in my last pick, but I think my last pick

1425
01:24:05,775 --> 01:24:08,675
Speaker 2:  is actually going to be fairly straightforwardly.

1426
01:24:09,615 --> 01:24:13,395
Speaker 2:  The dog collar from up. That lets you understand

1427
01:24:13,395 --> 01:24:15,075
Speaker 2:  what your dog is saying. Speak.

1428
01:24:15,295 --> 01:24:15,675
Speaker 30:  Hi there.

1429
01:24:17,455 --> 01:24:19,635
Speaker 31:  Did that dog just say hi there?

1430
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:23,795
Speaker 30:  Oh yes. My name is Doug. I have just

1431
01:24:23,895 --> 01:24:27,675
Speaker 30:  met you And I love you. My master made me this

1432
01:24:27,675 --> 01:24:31,515
Speaker 30:  collar. He's a good and smart master and he made me this collar so that

1433
01:24:31,635 --> 01:24:32,715
Speaker 30:  I may talk squirrel,

1434
01:24:35,515 --> 01:24:39,385
Speaker 2:  Which just is, is a thing. Like I have always said, like

1435
01:24:39,385 --> 01:24:42,705
Speaker 2:  if a, if a genie showed up and gave me three wishes, one of them for sure

1436
01:24:42,715 --> 01:24:45,865
Speaker 2:  would be like, I just wanna know what my dog is thinking about. It's all

1437
01:24:45,865 --> 01:24:47,185
Speaker 2:  I, it's all I think about all

1438
01:24:47,185 --> 01:24:48,585
Speaker 8:  The time. Would it work for cats too?

1439
01:24:49,955 --> 01:24:53,225
Speaker 2:  Let's see. Yeah. I feel like by the time if we have one of these for dogs,

1440
01:24:53,665 --> 01:24:56,225
Speaker 2:  somebody's gonna like reverse engineer it and figure it out for cats. So.

1441
01:24:56,225 --> 01:25:00,075
Speaker 2:  Sure. But I also feel like cats are just like, this guy sucks.

1442
01:25:00,075 --> 01:25:01,275
Speaker 2:  That's all cats. Right? You already know

1443
01:25:01,275 --> 01:25:02,075
Speaker 8:  What they're thinking. Yeah.

1444
01:25:02,315 --> 01:25:04,635
Speaker 2:  I don't cats thinking I don, I think we'd like cats less if we knew what

1445
01:25:04,635 --> 01:25:08,595
Speaker 2:  they were thinking. I think. Whereas like I would, I would love to be

1446
01:25:08,595 --> 01:25:11,635
Speaker 2:  able to just like hang out with my dog, see what he's up to. She's got a

1447
01:25:11,635 --> 01:25:15,195
Speaker 2:  lot of thoughts wandering around, looking at stuff, sleeping out there

1448
01:25:15,615 --> 01:25:18,715
Speaker 2:  be great. Just be like, how you doing? She's just like, I'm good kicking

1449
01:25:18,735 --> 01:25:21,915
Speaker 2:  it. I would, I would, this is all I want. Be delightful.

1450
01:25:22,275 --> 01:25:23,035
Speaker 14:  I love it. That's

1451
01:25:23,215 --> 01:25:23,595
Speaker 9:  So sweet.

1452
01:25:23,955 --> 01:25:27,235
Speaker 8:  I would also be really great when they're not feeling well and you'd be like,

1453
01:25:27,265 --> 01:25:29,755
Speaker 8:  what hurts? Why? And they could just tell you, they'd

1454
01:25:29,755 --> 01:25:31,475
Speaker 2:  Be like, well I ate rocks earlier. And I be like, well okay. I think

1455
01:25:31,495 --> 01:25:35,075
Speaker 9:  Now I know this is one of those tech ideas that the concept and the idea

1456
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:38,835
Speaker 9:  is probably better than the reality. Yeah. Because the reality is

1457
01:25:39,075 --> 01:25:42,555
Speaker 8:  Probably just, oh yeah, I already know Pablo Squirrel. Squirrel. Pablo's

1458
01:25:42,555 --> 01:25:43,515
Speaker 8:  gonna be like Kimball.

1459
01:25:46,145 --> 01:25:49,315
Speaker 2:  Yeah. My dog will just be like, I'm tired all the time. That'd be it.

1460
01:25:50,495 --> 01:25:52,595
Speaker 9:  Not great Conversationist. Probably,

1461
01:25:53,555 --> 01:25:56,715
Speaker 2:  Probably not. But it would make me happy. I would probably just have it for

1462
01:25:56,715 --> 01:25:59,475
Speaker 2:  like a day and then be like, all right, I get it. We're done with this. But

1463
01:25:59,475 --> 01:26:03,405
Speaker 2:  it would be a great day. So that, that's my last pick. Before we wrap

1464
01:26:03,405 --> 01:26:05,925
Speaker 2:  up and get outta here, any honorable mentions, anybody you wanna throw out?

1465
01:26:05,925 --> 01:26:09,525
Speaker 2:  There were a bunch of very obvious things that did not get picked. Nothing

1466
01:26:09,525 --> 01:26:13,085
Speaker 2:  from ready, ready player one got picked, none of the her stuff got picked.

1467
01:26:14,525 --> 01:26:17,365
Speaker 2:  VI thought you were gonna pick the video conferencing glasses from Kingsman

1468
01:26:17,365 --> 01:26:19,085
Speaker 2:  that we talk about all the time. Those didn't get picked.

1469
01:26:19,685 --> 01:26:23,405
Speaker 8:  I, you know, they were on my list. I, I almost picked they,

1470
01:26:23,435 --> 01:26:27,285
Speaker 8:  they were on there, but I just decided to go full selfish. But

1471
01:26:27,385 --> 01:26:31,245
Speaker 8:  my, my honorable full selfish mention pick, which was not,

1472
01:26:31,245 --> 01:26:34,565
Speaker 8:  that is the sonic showers from the Star Wars

1473
01:26:34,825 --> 01:26:38,605
Speaker 8:  comics and books. I don't know because yeah, no, no, they're not in the movies

1474
01:26:38,605 --> 01:26:42,525
Speaker 8:  because ain't nobody poops or takes a shower in Star Wars in the movies.

1475
01:26:43,185 --> 01:26:47,165
Speaker 8:  But in the books and the comics where they do have to, you know, deal

1476
01:26:47,195 --> 01:26:50,965
Speaker 8:  with the ephemera of life, you basically

1477
01:26:51,025 --> 01:26:54,925
Speaker 8:  go into a stall and sound vibrates all the dirt

1478
01:26:55,025 --> 01:26:58,725
Speaker 8:  off of you and then you can coopt your day. And I was like,

1479
01:26:58,945 --> 01:27:02,925
Speaker 8:  you know, sometimes I don't have time. Like you can take a shower if

1480
01:27:02,925 --> 01:27:05,845
Speaker 8:  you want to with the water and all that nonsense. But like if you're in,

1481
01:27:05,945 --> 01:27:09,725
Speaker 8:  you're in space, you're in a hurry, you can't use all that water sound

1482
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:13,085
Speaker 8:  will vibrate all the dirt off of you and you're, you're good to go. Will

1483
01:27:13,085 --> 01:27:13,645
Speaker 8:  it wash your

1484
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:17,565
Speaker 14:  Hair? Because washing and dry my hair is the bane of my existence.

1485
01:27:17,665 --> 01:27:21,605
Speaker 8:  No, it vibrates the dirt and the oil off of your hair and

1486
01:27:21,605 --> 01:27:22,445
Speaker 8:  you're just good to go.

1487
01:27:22,945 --> 01:27:23,285
Speaker 14:  I'm in.

1488
01:27:23,595 --> 01:27:25,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah, you should have picked this. That's a good one. Yeah,

1489
01:27:25,285 --> 01:27:29,125
Speaker 8:  You're good to go. Listen the click remote, just it was either this

1490
01:27:29,215 --> 01:27:30,685
Speaker 8:  skips with click remote skips. Sure. I skipped

1491
01:27:30,685 --> 01:27:34,405
Speaker 2:  Meetings. Skips. Yeah. V has her priorities straight. Any

1492
01:27:34,465 --> 01:27:37,925
Speaker 2:  any other honorable mentions we should mention? Any other favorites that

1493
01:27:37,925 --> 01:27:41,165
Speaker 2:  didn't get picked? I almost picked the helicopter hat from

1494
01:27:41,355 --> 01:27:44,485
Speaker 2:  Inspector Gadget. Oh my God. That's a such, but once I got the hoverboard,

1495
01:27:44,525 --> 01:27:48,045
Speaker 2:  I didn't need that anymore. I had a lot of like how David gets around

1496
01:27:48,185 --> 01:27:51,765
Speaker 2:  things. Yeah. That turned out to be very important to me that, but I got

1497
01:27:51,765 --> 01:27:53,405
Speaker 2:  the hoverboard so it was fine. Yeah.

1498
01:27:53,765 --> 01:27:57,445
Speaker 9:  I almost, I did wanna pick but I, it didn't really fit exactly

1499
01:27:57,915 --> 01:28:01,685
Speaker 9:  well with the Minority Report interface, the computer,

1500
01:28:02,035 --> 01:28:04,685
Speaker 9:  like I feel like we are really close to that too.

1501
01:28:04,795 --> 01:28:05,845
Speaker 8:  It's so much work. It

1502
01:28:05,845 --> 01:28:08,685
Speaker 2:  Just seems like a lot of work. I have to like, you have to stand there and

1503
01:28:08,685 --> 01:28:11,645
Speaker 2:  go like this for like 15 minutes. Like I'd be so tired at the end of the

1504
01:28:11,645 --> 01:28:12,085
Speaker 2:  workday. Yeah.

1505
01:28:12,085 --> 01:28:15,285
Speaker 9:  I don't know. And that's, I like, I feel like the next level of that, 'cause

1506
01:28:15,345 --> 01:28:18,845
Speaker 9:  the whole kind of disc thing was a bit much, but I feel like just being able

1507
01:28:18,845 --> 01:28:22,485
Speaker 9:  to touch the air and have things happen is what I want. That's what I want

1508
01:28:22,485 --> 01:28:23,645
Speaker 9:  to happen in my small, I'll

1509
01:28:23,645 --> 01:28:26,925
Speaker 8:  Say I've talked to a lot of XR developers and whatnot and one, one thing

1510
01:28:26,925 --> 01:28:29,805
Speaker 8:  that they'll say is, well, like they've tried making that, but the thing

1511
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:33,485
Speaker 8:  that people don't anticipate is how much your arms hurt from doing that all

1512
01:28:33,485 --> 01:28:37,325
Speaker 8:  the time. It's like an arm Pilates workout and they're like, oh shit. No.

1513
01:28:37,515 --> 01:28:37,805
Speaker 8:  Yeah,

1514
01:28:37,805 --> 01:28:41,205
Speaker 2:  Like Tom Cruise can do it. I cannot, I don't have a, I don't have a nine

1515
01:28:41,205 --> 01:28:43,645
Speaker 2:  to five of just twisting my arms around in me.

1516
01:28:45,305 --> 01:28:48,365
Speaker 2:  All right. Well I think I'm glad nobody picked her. I was really excited

1517
01:28:48,365 --> 01:28:52,205
Speaker 2:  to pick a fight with anybody who picked Samantha from her. I will

1518
01:28:52,205 --> 01:28:55,365
Speaker 2:  say there is one computer in that thing where he just sits down and like

1519
01:28:55,365 --> 01:28:58,525
Speaker 2:  talks to his iMac with no mouse or keyboard. He just sort of chats with it

1520
01:28:58,525 --> 01:29:01,845
Speaker 2:  about his email that I kind of like. I'm good getting rid of all of that.

1521
01:29:01,845 --> 01:29:02,405
Speaker 2:  It seems fun.

1522
01:29:02,755 --> 01:29:05,325
Speaker 9:  This is where I have to admit that I've never seen that movie. Isn't

1523
01:29:05,325 --> 01:29:08,125
Speaker 2:  It? It is a terrific movie and everyone should watch it. It's so good.

1524
01:29:08,445 --> 01:29:10,565
Speaker 7:  I haven't watched it. It held up amazingly. It

1525
01:29:10,565 --> 01:29:11,005
Speaker 2:  Really did. I

1526
01:29:11,005 --> 01:29:14,365
Speaker 8:  Just, I, oh my god, I just was on like a Joaquin Phoenix band for a while

1527
01:29:14,385 --> 01:29:17,445
Speaker 8:  and then like it's, I'm still on that. And so then it was just like, oh

1528
01:29:18,155 --> 01:29:19,685
Speaker 8:  damn. People say that one's

1529
01:29:19,685 --> 01:29:22,285
Speaker 2:  Good. I should watch it. I watch understand that. But that movie is, is excellent

1530
01:29:22,285 --> 01:29:23,605
Speaker 2:  and it holds up, but also

1531
01:29:25,115 --> 01:29:28,915
Speaker 2:  dystopia. Like I don't, I just, it's Act one

1532
01:29:29,005 --> 01:29:32,755
Speaker 2:  seems so good. Watch the rest of the movie. That's like, if there's one lesson

1533
01:29:32,815 --> 01:29:36,475
Speaker 2:  to learn from all of these, it's watch the rest of the movie 'cause

1534
01:29:36,585 --> 01:29:40,475
Speaker 2:  because sometimes it doesn't turn out so great. That's, that's where it

1535
01:29:40,475 --> 01:29:44,355
Speaker 2:  goes. Alright, we should get out of here the four of you. So
