00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:06,520
Speaker 2:  Welcome to the Verge Cast, the flagship podcast of slightly inaccurate fitness

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,560
Speaker 2:  trackers. I'm your friend David Pierce and lemme just tell you about the

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,960
Speaker 2:  day I'm having. So on Sunday night we get home from being away for the weekend

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,870
Speaker 2:  and we go to bed and then at about 11 or so we get a knock on the door

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,760
Speaker 2:  from a police officer. Turns out a tree fell on our car. Now

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,600
Speaker 2:  it's three days later, there's still a tree on our car. The road's still

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,240
Speaker 2:  closed and I'm standing here staring at it, wondering if I could just pick

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,000
Speaker 2:  it up and lift it off my car myself. I'm not supposed to cuz it's

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,350
Speaker 2:  technically hung up on a power line but I feel like I could do it, you know.

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,960
Speaker 2:  Anyway, enough about me. We have a great show coming up today. McKenna Kelly

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,720
Speaker 2:  is gonna come on and explain why. Yay. Formerly known as Kanye West

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,640
Speaker 2:  might be buying Parlor. And we're gonna check in on all of

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,400
Speaker 2:  the other conservative leaning social apps like Truth, Social and Gutter

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,240
Speaker 2:  and Rumble and try to figure out what's going on with them. Then later Dan

16
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,760
Speaker 2:  Seaford and Victoria Song are gonna help me figure out whether the Pixel

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,460
Speaker 2:  Watch, Apple Watch or Galaxy Watch is truly the best smart watch out there.

18
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,080
Speaker 2:  And then we've got some great questions on the Verge Cast hotline, so we're

19
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,800
Speaker 2:  gonna answer as many of those as we can as well. All that is coming up. But

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,760
Speaker 2:  first I'm gonna go try and lift this tree. Wish me luck and pray that I

21
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,760
Speaker 2:  don't throw out my back or electrocute myself to death. This is the Verge

22
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,460
Speaker 2:  cast. We'll see you in a sec.

23
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,950
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. So Monday morning this week brought what I would

24
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,830
Speaker 2:  argue is the single most 2022 news story of

25
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,480
Speaker 2:  all time, maybe even possible. Kanye West, now known as Yay,

26
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,030
Speaker 2:  is apparently buying Parlor, the conservative leaning social media

27
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,937
Speaker 2:  network. So we have yay owning Parlor, Elon Musk owning Twitter, Donald

28
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:52,990
Speaker 2:  Trump owning Truth Social. There's this whole new set of apps

29
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,790
Speaker 2:  and app owners entering the social space and it feels like it's all getting

30
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,650
Speaker 2:  very weird in real time. Parlor's pitch basically is that it is

31
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,480
Speaker 2:  un cancellable and a fight against censorship. That's also the pitch you'll

32
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,720
Speaker 2:  hear from Truth, Social and Rumble and even the way that Musk

33
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,320
Speaker 2:  increasingly describes Twitter. But as that pitch actually

34
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,720
Speaker 2:  working, it doesn't feel to me like any of these apps

35
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,340
Speaker 2:  obviously except for Twitter have really hit mainstream.

36
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,930
Speaker 2:  But are they headed that way? McKenna Kelly has been tracking the progress

37
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,760
Speaker 2:  of these sites and apps as they try to take on the Twitters and Facebooks

38
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,560
Speaker 2:  and ticks of the world. So let's try to see where they

39
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,530
Speaker 2:  are. Hi McKenna.

40
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,880
Speaker 4:  Hi. It's good to be here.

41
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,200
Speaker 2:  Let's start by talking about Parlor. There's a bunch of like different apps

42
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,520
Speaker 2:  and services I wanna talk about but parlors in the news cuz it's maybe

43
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,320
Speaker 2:  possibly, I would argue probably not gonna be owned by Yay formerly

44
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,440
Speaker 2:  Kanye West at some point. But in reading about this, parlor's been through

45
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,360
Speaker 2:  sort of a weird year. I feel like everybody knows it as like the conservative

46
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,870
Speaker 2:  leaning social media app, but it seems like from your reporting

47
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,800
Speaker 2:  that that's not really what it wants to be anymore.

48
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,760
Speaker 4:  Right. Yesterday I ended up talking to a bunch of sources who told

49
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,680
Speaker 4:  me that Parlor has been trying now Parliament Technologies, they

50
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,480
Speaker 4:  rebranded about a month ago after they acquired at something

51
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,840
Speaker 4:  called Dyna Scale and was were pivoting towards more cloud

52
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,200
Speaker 4:  services, internet infrastructure business rather than social media. But

53
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,170
Speaker 4:  over the last couple of weeks they've been trying to offload Parlor,

54
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,600
Speaker 4:  It is a failing social media network. No one really uses it

55
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,590
Speaker 4:  anymore and they see more of a business need and a market

56
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,560
Speaker 4:  need with un Cancellable cloud services

57
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,130
Speaker 4:  for other online businesses.

58
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,680
Speaker 2:  So, and this has been a thing for a while, right? Because like I think back

59
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,840
Speaker 2:  to even the, there was like the controversy about like the the Chans and

60
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,520
Speaker 2:  like the Daily Storm and this question of like who actually is in charge

61
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,100
Speaker 2:  of moderating this stuff and what should be allowed on you know,

62
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,560
Speaker 2:  AWS versus what should cloud for allow? And we had these like big long conversations

63
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,880
Speaker 2:  and it seems like it doesn't strike me as a totally crazy idea to be the

64
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,800
Speaker 2:  company that will like host and prop up and support these other companies

65
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,640
Speaker 2:  and that like this is the kind of thing that this universe of

66
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,600
Speaker 2:  social apps really needs. Like as business pivots go, this one actually makes

67
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,500
Speaker 2:  a lot of sense to me

68
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,040
Speaker 4:  And it's been happening for a while. So I would take a look at Parlor did

69
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,920
Speaker 4:  this, you know, made this pivot last month but there's also companies like

70
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,440
Speaker 4:  Right Forge that have sprung up to fill this need. And then also Rumble as

71
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,000
Speaker 4:  well has been working on cloud services and even like payment processing

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,590
Speaker 4:  and things like that. So even before, you know, this turn

73
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,280
Speaker 4:  this year with Parlor people had been seeing that maybe the social

74
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,840
Speaker 4:  media market for alternative apps is a little saturated.

75
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,680
Speaker 4:  There's too many people we can't compete. So now there's this other

76
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,870
Speaker 4:  adjacent market opening up with cloud services.

77
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,320
Speaker 2:  That's interesting and well I want to come back to that cause I think the,

78
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,060
Speaker 2:  the sort of broader market here is really interesting but in parlor's case,

79
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,780
Speaker 2:  the like joke going around was right that it's like Eon Musk and Twitter

80
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,680
Speaker 2:  and yay and Parlor. But the difference is that yay probably paid

81
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,320
Speaker 2:  like $45 for Parlor because by all

82
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,760
Speaker 2:  accounts it like this thing has not succeeded, right? Like is is this app

83
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,540
Speaker 2:  working in any way?

84
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,440
Speaker 4:  One of the prospective buyers that I spoke to yesterday told me when

85
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,400
Speaker 4:  they were looking at the records and the numbers for Parlor, they had about

86
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,920
Speaker 4:  50,000 daily active users, which is

87
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,400
Speaker 4:  extremely anemic compared to I think Twitter's last quarterly

88
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,320
Speaker 4:  earnings report said it was about like they had about 230 million so compared

89
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,280
Speaker 4:  230 million to 50,000 daily active

90
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,000
Speaker 2:  Users and Twitter is one that is like not a smashing success story. So

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,920
Speaker 2:  it's like that's, that's bleak. Okay, why isn't it working? Like what, what

92
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,860
Speaker 2:  is the problem with Parlor?

93
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,760
Speaker 4:  The problem with Parlor I think is a little bit twofold. The platform launched

94
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,440
Speaker 4:  in 2018 as one of the original censorship

95
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,370
Speaker 4:  free, free speech platforms to come out of the Trump administration

96
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:43,200
Speaker 4:  in this Donald Trump first big tech culture war that brewed

97
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,120
Speaker 4:  during, you know, his presidency, they were fine but it also led

98
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,830
Speaker 4:  to other groups announcing other competing services. You have Gap

99
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,740
Speaker 4:  Getter Rumble, all of these places, alternative ways for them to,

100
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,600
Speaker 4:  you know, find I guess the same service, right? But when it

101
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,340
Speaker 4:  comes to Parlor, Parlor was one of the platforms that was

102
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:06,240
Speaker 4:  effectively de platform last year entirely after the

103
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:09,920
Speaker 4:  January 6th riot. So Apple took it down, Google Play Store took it

104
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,800
Speaker 4:  down, AWS took down its website and it wasn't until

105
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,680
Speaker 4:  May that parlor was then reinstated on the app store. And it wasn't even

106
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,640
Speaker 4:  until September, like a few weeks ago that Parlor got back on the

107
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,360
Speaker 4:  Google Play store. Oh wow. Which of course has tremendously more users

108
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,120
Speaker 4:  globally than Apple's App Store, right? So this company

109
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,800
Speaker 4:  really suffered from being de platformed and at the same time when I say

110
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,320
Speaker 4:  this is a twofold thing, the second part is, oh my gosh, all of a sudden

111
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,160
Speaker 4:  there's truth social coming up this year there's more, you know,

112
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,000
Speaker 4:  bigger name competitors in this space than Parlor and Parlor just

113
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,950
Speaker 4:  completely missed out on that wave.

114
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,480
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So it, it seems to me, and you pay a lot more attention to this space

115
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,640
Speaker 2:  than I do, I, I feel like I, I sort of like where I am with these apps which

116
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,640
Speaker 2:  is like blatantly aware that they exist but I don't spend a lot of time on

117
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,520
Speaker 2:  them. But it seems like the one that has like crept into not

118
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,170
Speaker 2:  quite mainstreamness but something much bigger than just like a handful

119
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:07,080
Speaker 2:  of angry band Twitter users is Rumble like Rumble which

120
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,200
Speaker 2:  is basically like a, a YouTube competitor in sort of this same like free

121
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,800
Speaker 2:  speech un cancellable vein you're talking about. It's the one that seems

122
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,750
Speaker 2:  to be working the best. Is that fair? Is that your experience to

123
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,600
Speaker 4:  I think Rumble is the one to make the easiest case about, for example,

124
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,510
Speaker 4:  like earlier was it just a couple weeks ago Rumble went public like they

125
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:28,320
Speaker 4:  iPod which is crazy cuz none of these other platforms have

126
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,120
Speaker 4:  done that. When we talk about Rumble, why I think it's probably

127
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,080
Speaker 4:  the most successful and I think Getter arguably is also like the

128
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,840
Speaker 4:  second most successful compared to Rumble. You gotta look at, you know, how

129
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,640
Speaker 4:  they're trying to monetize the service and how they're getting

130
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,600
Speaker 4:  people on. Of course with Rumble you have folks like Russell

131
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,400
Speaker 4:  brand big names that they're getting on to sign exclusive deals for

132
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,160
Speaker 4:  shows that you know, people in this area of the internet,

133
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,720
Speaker 4:  this ecosystem, the internet really admire and listen to, right? I think

134
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,320
Speaker 4:  Russell Brand used to have a YouTube show, I think he might have been de

135
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,760
Speaker 4:  Platform, not entirely sure there And then also with Gutter, Gutter has also

136
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,480
Speaker 4:  been good about getting influencers on the platform and

137
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,960
Speaker 4:  incentivizing them to use it. Gutter as well has a video component Now over

138
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,120
Speaker 4:  the summer it launched its vision service which is technically

139
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,000
Speaker 4:  TikTok but for conservatives I haven't spent too much time

140
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,600
Speaker 4:  with that but they're growing in different ways like that. But you look at

141
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,360
Speaker 4:  Parlor, Parlor just really didn't, I guess give

142
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,600
Speaker 4:  like the right I know deals to get people on the platform. You look at the,

143
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,080
Speaker 4:  some of the exclusives that it has and it's Benny Johnson a contributor to

144
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,800
Speaker 4:  Turning Point USA has like a show called the Left Camp Meme and

145
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,760
Speaker 4:  arguably it's one of the most cringe things I've ever watched in my entire

146
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,360
Speaker 4:  life. And I think the audience for it doesn't really even

147
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,130
Speaker 4:  exist and they're probably over the age of 60 and they aren't even on Parlor.

148
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,560
Speaker 4:  So that's kinda where we are with that. And the other thing is, I, I just

149
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,360
Speaker 4:  wanna go and talk about Truth. Truth has one big user and that's

150
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,320
Speaker 4:  Donald Trump, right? So a lot of these come down to exclusivity with

151
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,580
Speaker 4:  content and who's really winning and attracting the most

152
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,320
Speaker 4:  influential people onto the platforms.

153
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,000
Speaker 2:  Interesting. Cause the next thing I was gonna ask you is like do you think

154
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,810
Speaker 2:  this idea of conservative focused social media

155
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,360
Speaker 2:  is even a thing we're, we're like several years into this

156
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,440
Speaker 2:  pitch for a lot of these companies now, but it almost sounds like what you're

157
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,760
Speaker 2:  saying, like I feel like what you just described is not social networks but

158
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,600
Speaker 2:  like streaming services and we're now in like a Spotify versus

159
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,920
Speaker 2:  Apple Music War, but for like

160
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,800
Speaker 2:  conservative radio hosts as opposed to like there maybe they

161
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,200
Speaker 2:  don't need to try and get Twitter's scale, they're just trying to be like

162
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,960
Speaker 2:  entertainment platforms like Fox News but on the internet, right? Like is

163
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,270
Speaker 2:  that where all this is going?

164
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:45,120
Speaker 4:  I think it's important to note that a lot of the platforms,

165
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,880
Speaker 4:  these alt ones that are, I guess you can say succeeding

166
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,720
Speaker 4:  in air quotes have a wider user base than

167
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,070
Speaker 4:  just conservatives. So look at Rumble.

168
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,000
Speaker 4:  Rumble recently struck a deal with Andrew Tate, Andrew Tate being

169
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,640
Speaker 4:  that guy who's like a Mane, very sexist,

170
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,320
Speaker 4:  misogynistic content creator who was kicked off of TikTok Instagram, et

171
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,080
Speaker 4:  cetera and found a home on Rumble. Now that is an

172
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,320
Speaker 4:  inherently, you know, conservative political content more as it is like

173
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,080
Speaker 4:  this misogynistic lifestyle content, right? So

174
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,800
Speaker 4:  that's finding a home on Rumble. You look at Gutter, Gutter also has a

175
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,970
Speaker 4:  huge base in Brazil in the uk.

176
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,880
Speaker 4:  They're actively onboarding users in countries all across the

177
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,680
Speaker 4:  world and not just focusing on the US and US users. And I think that's

178
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,200
Speaker 4:  part of the reason why they've been successful. They're kind of growing the

179
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,170
Speaker 4:  space past politics and of course it's taking them a little bit longer

180
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,960
Speaker 4:  to grow maybe and really see the headlines that we see with like

181
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,440
Speaker 4:  Parlor being D platform, all this crazy stuff during the Trump administration.

182
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,200
Speaker 4:  But I do think they are, you know, in the middle of a slow leak

183
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,590
Speaker 4:  globally.

184
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:53,800
Speaker 2:  Okay, well what's interesting about that though is like Andrew Tate's actually

185
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,280
Speaker 2:  really interesting example, right? Cause it's like guy with a big audience

186
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,890
Speaker 2:  these other platforms decided they didn't want on their platform

187
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:03,440
Speaker 2:  anymore. And so if I'm one of these networks like it, it

188
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,520
Speaker 2:  makes absolute sense to me that somebody like Rumble right? Who who promotes

189
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,320
Speaker 2:  itself as like a against you know, censorship and cancellation

190
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,680
Speaker 2:  and pro-free speech. It's like that actually strikes me as like a match made

191
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,800
Speaker 2:  in heaven. But in reality there aren't actually that many of those people

192
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,560
Speaker 2:  and there are very few of those people who have like real big audiences.

193
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,040
Speaker 2:  So I guess part of what I'm trying to figure out is like does this idea scale

194
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,960
Speaker 2:  past that sort of small handful of people that everybody cares about, right?

195
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,520
Speaker 2:  Like obviously Trump is sort of the biggest example of like massively famous

196
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,440
Speaker 2:  person in a lot of people care very much about who was kicked off

197
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,240
Speaker 2:  of these other platforms. Like it makes sense that there is a set of people

198
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,400
Speaker 2:  who would go wherever he is. Same goes for Anate, same goes for like this

199
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,630
Speaker 2:  other handful of people but that only gets you so far, right?

200
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,320
Speaker 4:  I don't know, it only does get you so far. But the same time I look at the

201
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,920
Speaker 4:  Elon, I gotta think like Twitter isn't real life, right? This is the, this

202
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,890
Speaker 4:  is the cornerstone of this beat.

203
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:59,760
Speaker 4:  So you see how folks react to Elon, this is, he has so many

204
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,510
Speaker 4:  fanboy fan girls and that came across, you know, those grew out of

205
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,480
Speaker 4:  I guess just Elon being Elon. But in the early days this you know, kind

206
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,440
Speaker 4:  of progressive virtue of combating climate change with Tesla and all that

207
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,320
Speaker 4:  stuff, right? So he's finding himself in the same boat, maybe not

208
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,280
Speaker 4:  the same life boat off the Titanic but an adjacent one, a

209
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,240
Speaker 4:  separate one coming off of this like kind of cultural moment that we're in.

210
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,840
Speaker 4:  It's Elon Musk people, Kanye West now, you know buying Parlor.

211
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,400
Speaker 4:  This is a somebody who has been in culture for a very long time, one of the

212
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,200
Speaker 4:  most famous rappers, you know, married to Kim Kardashian at one point

213
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,080
Speaker 4:  in time, who is the biggest influencer social media user of all

214
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,920
Speaker 4:  time. I don't want to, I think it's very easy to say

215
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,400
Speaker 4:  as reporters as people in the media that these are

216
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,360
Speaker 4:  failing platforms like Parlor Gutter, et cetera. But at the same

217
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,120
Speaker 4:  time you look at the people who are hawking to this, who feel a

218
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,080
Speaker 4:  lack of control in their own personal narrative online, whether it be Kanye,

219
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,880
Speaker 4:  Elon, whoever who jumped to these things in order to claim

220
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,800
Speaker 4:  that narrative back. And I think now that this is a trend, right? With

221
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,440
Speaker 4:  Trump and truth social Elon Musk with Twitter and now

222
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,120
Speaker 4:  Kanye with Parlor, even though Parlor is anemic and awful and terrible, I

223
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,040
Speaker 4:  think it does set an example and even if we aren't in a place right now

224
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,710
Speaker 4:  where these companies are profitable and successes, I think this is giving

225
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:22,280
Speaker 4:  them all a sense of, I dunno, legitimacy over the past couple

226
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:22,710
Speaker 4:  weeks.

227
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,440
Speaker 2:  Yeah, no that makes total sense. And I guess, and this comes back to the

228
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,520
Speaker 2:  cloud services thing too. It's right, it seems like what is increasingly

229
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,280
Speaker 2:  happening is is we're just getting different sort of full stack

230
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,040
Speaker 2:  silos. But then that comes back to this idea that like the unifying

231
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,950
Speaker 2:  thing is these two app stores and it's Google and Apple have

232
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,720
Speaker 2:  just a gigantic amount of control and there's just nothing any of these apps,

233
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,250
Speaker 2:  no matter how you feel about it can do about that fact, right? And it's like

234
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,560
Speaker 2:  as we talk about even TikTok in China, like the companies that have the most

235
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,760
Speaker 2:  influence there, there are the ones who run the app stores because they ultimately

236
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,360
Speaker 2:  get to decide based on whatever they feel like whether these things live

237
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,680
Speaker 2:  or die. And we've seen the effect when they get kicked out what happens next.

238
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,360
Speaker 2:  But then there was this thing recently where like I think Truth Social just

239
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,200
Speaker 2:  recently got back into the Play store and there's been like you said all

240
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,360
Speaker 2:  these issues with Parlor over the course of this year. What's your sense

241
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,920
Speaker 2:  of where all of that is headed? Like can these, can these

242
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,680
Speaker 2:  platforms stay on the right side of the app stores? Do we want them to,

243
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,420
Speaker 2:  are they going to, what's your sense?

244
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,280
Speaker 4:  The way that I view this is mostly that the Trump fight with

245
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,820
Speaker 4:  big tech has created this small, albeit small

246
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,800
Speaker 4:  but mighty group of people Yeah. Who want nothing to do with

247
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,600
Speaker 4:  the mainstream platforms and albeit it's growing into the mainstream economy,

248
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,820
Speaker 4:  right? You see right-leaning folks launching

249
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,320
Speaker 4:  conservative anti woke credit

250
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,070
Speaker 4:  cards. Yeah. Banks now a lot of these things have failed but

251
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,920
Speaker 4:  I think back to, I think it was the Dan Bonino company a couple months ago

252
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,490
Speaker 4:  that tried to copyright the phrase quote parallel

253
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,240
Speaker 4:  economy. Hmm. So there's movement and there's definitely

254
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,480
Speaker 4:  money. I don't know how much money on the right to build

255
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,440
Speaker 4:  out an alternative economy to that with which

256
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,960
Speaker 4:  you know, most people engage in, whether it's Visa, MasterCard, we saw the

257
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,940
Speaker 4:  blow up with PayPal the other week about their misinformation policies

258
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,360
Speaker 4:  and things like that. That's just all getting blown over into this separate

259
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,900
Speaker 4:  bucket of these people who feel

260
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,520
Speaker 4:  disenfranchised by the mainstream media, mainstream economy, et

261
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,240
Speaker 4:  cetera. And so right now is it a competitor? I don't think

262
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,160
Speaker 4:  so. I don't think it's probably gonna make that much money but it's gaining

263
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,060
Speaker 4:  steam and the more that we see folks like yay, Kanye West

264
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,880
Speaker 4:  and all these big name people putting a lot more money, whether it's

265
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,720
Speaker 4:  money or just attention to this, I do think it does have the

266
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,520
Speaker 4:  possibility to grow, especially with the internet the way it is, right? Like

267
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,480
Speaker 4:  people who want this information, who want to know about Kanye West and want

268
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,520
Speaker 4:  to know about these things, they know where to find it. Yeah. And they know

269
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,370
Speaker 4:  that they can find other, you know, adjacent platforms to use

270
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,960
Speaker 4:  to find these things. I don't know, I just at this time it's like these platforms

271
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,840
Speaker 4:  have been around for not so long. Parlor was 2018 and a

272
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,480
Speaker 4:  lot of things cropped up in 20 20, 20 21. But there is a lot of money

273
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,380
Speaker 4:  behind it. Like there's a lot of investment firms and things like that.

274
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,320
Speaker 4:  The IPO that I can't like turn a blind eye, I think it's wrong to turn

275
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,880
Speaker 4:  a blind eye. I think that there is accountability necessary for these things,

276
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,270
Speaker 4:  but at the same time you don't wanna give them too much credence.

277
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,880
Speaker 2:  It's an interesting moment. I agree cuz it's like there is enough going on

278
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,800
Speaker 2:  in this space that it feels like something substantial is happening

279
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,440
Speaker 2:  there. But it's hard to figure out like if, if you asked me to like pick

280
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,060
Speaker 2:  a winner between you know, Gab Parlor and Truth Social

281
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,760
Speaker 2:  and then even like the the Mews of the world, I feel like anyone who would

282
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,640
Speaker 2:  guess the answer would be just lying. We're all just kind of making it

283
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,440
Speaker 2:  up and there's so much like sameness in all of these and what I think it's

284
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,000
Speaker 2:  gonna be fascinating, I was just looking at like Sensor Tower which tracks

285
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,660
Speaker 2:  a lot of the app downloads and Parlor had a big jump after

286
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,520
Speaker 2:  the, the yay thing was announced. Which on the one hand makes sense because

287
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,280
Speaker 2:  it's in the news, people are always gonna download stuff when it's in the

288
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,920
Speaker 2:  news. But also like you're right, he is this like massively

289
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,760
Speaker 2:  famous presence who probably will draw some number of people

290
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,640
Speaker 2:  to him wherever he goes. And that right now is the best thing

291
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,240
Speaker 2:  that these platforms have going for them. And if they're gonna get where

292
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,160
Speaker 2:  they want to go, like 230 million people aren't on Twitter just for

293
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,280
Speaker 2:  Elon Musk, right? Like some of them probably are but like you have to get

294
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,040
Speaker 2:  past that before you can really build something of huge

295
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,920
Speaker 2:  substance. And it's gonna be really interesting to see if anyone can get

296
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,680
Speaker 2:  there at that kind of scale. It's

297
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,390
Speaker 4:  Also important to note that I think Kanye had less than

298
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,800
Speaker 4:  a hundred followers on Parlor. He set up his account last week. Last time

299
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,530
Speaker 4:  I checked early this morning it was less than 16,000. That is

300
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:39,720
Speaker 4:  so small compared to I think it was like the 30 million he had on Twitter.

301
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,560
Speaker 4:  His reach is so small. And so when it comes like the motivation

302
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,520
Speaker 4:  behind the sale, albeit like who knows how

303
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,400
Speaker 4:  much they sold it to Kanye for or want to sell it to Kanye for or if they

304
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,160
Speaker 4:  even plan on sending it to Kanye cuz no nothing's been signed. Maybe this

305
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,040
Speaker 4:  is just a whole publicity stunt to raise the price of parlor

306
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,040
Speaker 4:  and get it off to someone else who can do it. I mean I was talking to prospective

307
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,600
Speaker 4:  buyers and they just called the number that Parliament was asking as like

308
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,480
Speaker 4:  absurd, it was just too high not even near the price that they would be willing

309
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,360
Speaker 4:  to pay for it, right? And so either Kanye got duped into

310
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,030
Speaker 4:  spending a lot of money for this or he got it for

311
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,920
Speaker 4:  like a $2 bill and a handshake, you know, to make it

312
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,130
Speaker 4:  like look good and hopefully and maybe later he dips out, who knows?

313
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,760
Speaker 2:  Do all these folks see the Elon owned Twitter as like an

314
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,840
Speaker 2:  existential threat to this entire thing? Because if he does some of the stuff

315
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,640
Speaker 2:  that he said he's gonna do reinstate Trump way, reduce the terms of

316
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,480
Speaker 2:  service, make the rules much more lax for people to post on there. That seems

317
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,480
Speaker 2:  like take the thing that those people like about the platforms they already

318
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,400
Speaker 2:  have add 230 million users and suddenly that's

319
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,200
Speaker 2:  gonna be the one that a lot of these folks would pick, right? Like is if

320
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,400
Speaker 2:  Elon does buy Twitter, do a lot of these things just sort of die on the vine

321
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,000
Speaker 2:  as a result?

322
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,440
Speaker 4:  Maybe. But you look at the news this morning that

323
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,920
Speaker 4:  Kanye intends to have dinner with Trump this week.

324
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,520
Speaker 4:  Kanye is going to make a truth social account and he's going to invite Trump

325
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,310
Speaker 4:  on parlor.

326
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,090
Speaker 2:  Okay

327
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,800
Speaker 4:  So what does this mean, right? So what does this mean? It's very clear and

328
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,480
Speaker 4:  I've been hearing this from sources in like the Republican you know

329
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,160
Speaker 4:  right wing online ecosystem for a while that they don't even care

330
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,930
Speaker 4:  about who ends up being the winner. They just want an opportunity

331
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:22,840
Speaker 4:  to show that they are a powerful force, right? They

332
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,400
Speaker 4:  want to be able to influence the mainstream media and whether that's, you

333
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,040
Speaker 4:  know, combining into one major platform. Sure, maybe, or maybe it's just

334
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,720
Speaker 4:  drawing the attention of all of these, you know, celebrities who do have

335
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,520
Speaker 4:  weight and who do have large audiences to show them that hey actually

336
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,320
Speaker 4:  mainstream culture isn't like Hollywood progressive, it's also us

337
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,480
Speaker 4:  right now. Whether or not you can always ask whether or not it's true. I

338
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,240
Speaker 4:  doubt it's true, it's a very false narrative but it seems like

339
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,440
Speaker 4:  that's kind of the more of the angle that they're pushing and they have so

340
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,067
Speaker 4:  much money. Look at the Republican investors, look at Rebecca Mercer,

341
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:59,160
Speaker 4:  all these folks, Peter Teal now they have so much money to throw at these

342
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,960
Speaker 4:  things and just a bid for cultural influence and cultural

343
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,780
Speaker 4:  relevancy. And I think that's the major narrative here.

344
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,760
Speaker 4:  You know, if you peel away all of like the little tit for tat company

345
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,560
Speaker 4:  versus company, it really comes down to hoping to influence

346
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,440
Speaker 4:  this like progressive leftist, whatever culture that they see as,

347
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,267
Speaker 4:  you know, encompassing the United States.

348
00:21:20,267 --> 00:21:23,560
Speaker 2:  Totally. Yeah and it's, it's an interesting question whether what you need

349
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,480
Speaker 2:  is sort of one gigantic player or if you can do

350
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,320
Speaker 2:  it with kind of a lot of different slices of the pie. We've

351
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,280
Speaker 2:  never really seen that work in social like it's been very hard to be

352
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,080
Speaker 2:  a small social network over time. So it's, it's gonna be interesting to see

353
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,600
Speaker 2:  if anybody in that space can pull it off. What are you looking at towards

354
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,150
Speaker 2:  the midterms? We're, we're two weeks out from an election, this is all bubbling

355
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:49,120
Speaker 2:  kind of as political conversation is, is reaching this

356
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,960
Speaker 2:  like crazy fever pitch ahead of the midterms? What are you looking at and

357
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,720
Speaker 2:  looking for as you poke around all these platforms?

358
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,520
Speaker 4:  What I think is most important to bring in this discussion is the stakes.

359
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,160
Speaker 4:  Hmm. There are a lot of stakes here with whoever wins the senate, whoever

360
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,900
Speaker 4:  wins the house, you know, whoever has control of these things because if

361
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,570
Speaker 4:  you know Democrats are able to maintain their majorities

362
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,240
Speaker 4:  or Republicans end up taking the house, which is what it seems like

363
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,210
Speaker 4:  likely this is gonna have a lot of effects on the way that social media

364
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,440
Speaker 4:  is regulated or not regulated under the rest of the Biden

365
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,240
Speaker 4:  administration. So I can imagine, you know, if we

366
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,090
Speaker 4:  have Democrats somehow maintaining their majority

367
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:29,400
Speaker 4:  in the house, maintaining a majority in the Senate, they would probably pursue,

368
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,080
Speaker 4:  you know, a greater data privacy framework, maybe get that through. That

369
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,280
Speaker 4:  of course is a Biden administration priority. Hopefully they'd be able to

370
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,980
Speaker 4:  get Gigi so confirmed who is the

371
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,280
Speaker 4:  FCC nominee who

372
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,950
Speaker 2:  Has, I'm talking about that for decades it feels like.

373
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,880
Speaker 4:  I know cuz she was nominated almost two years ago and

374
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,000
Speaker 4:  has not gotten the state. So the FCC is like just total lame

375
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,960
Speaker 4:  duck. And now if the Republicans, you know are even able just to take

376
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,280
Speaker 4:  back the house, there's gonna be so many investigations into like the Hunter

377
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,750
Speaker 4:  Biden laptop. There's gonna be investigations

378
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:05,640
Speaker 4:  into perhaps like taking a more tougher look at TikTok

379
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,560
Speaker 4:  rather than US companies and just kind of putting thet US companies to the

380
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,400
Speaker 4:  side and targeting like TikTok and other foreign-based entities.

381
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,240
Speaker 4:  So there's a lot at stake about like the future over the next two years.

382
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,680
Speaker 4:  And I think it's very critical at a time when we've spent like the last five

383
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,270
Speaker 4:  years since 2016, frankly debating these issues

384
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:26,160
Speaker 4:  that they're finally yarning enough steam and with bills that are actually

385
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,280
Speaker 4:  moving places. Like a merger filing fee actually got passed like a couple

386
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,080
Speaker 4:  weeks ago. So big tech would have to like pay more of a fee in order to

387
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,040
Speaker 4:  acquire nascent competitors. Like that actually is change. So we're starting

388
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,000
Speaker 4:  to get this momentum and I think depending on who ha who's in charge,

389
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,240
Speaker 4:  somebody's gonna hit the brakes or someone's gonna hit the accelerator and

390
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,400
Speaker 4:  that's mainly what I'm looking

391
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,440
Speaker 2:  For. Fair enough. All right, well we're gonna have more chances over the

392
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,800
Speaker 2:  next few weeks to talk about all of that, but thank you and if you see anything

393
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,310
Speaker 2:  cool on Rumble, you know, let me know.

394
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,360
Speaker 4:  Always searching Rumble.

395
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,880
Speaker 2:  All right, thanks McKenna. All

396
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,550
Speaker 4:  Right, bye.

397
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:04,320
Speaker 2:  Okay, we need to take a break but then we are gonna come back and try to

398
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,240
Speaker 2:  sort through all of the smart watches that have been launched this year and

399
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,640
Speaker 2:  try to figure out once and for all which one's the best. We'll be right

400
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:21,390
Speaker 2:  back.

401
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:32,080
Speaker 4:  Welcome back. It's been a huge year for smart

402
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,800
Speaker 4:  watches. All the phone announcements we got this year were

403
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,720
Speaker 4:  relatively normal and like fine but not that interesting. But there

404
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,320
Speaker 4:  is so much interesting stuff happening in the smart watch world and

405
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,880
Speaker 4:  really there are three at the end of the day that matter the most. There's

406
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,240
Speaker 4:  the Apple Watch series eight, the Pixel Watch and the Galaxy Watch five.

407
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,000
Speaker 2:  Those are the flagship smart watches. The ones that most people are

408
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,920
Speaker 2:  probably choosing between to some extent. Which watch you use is governed

409
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,120
Speaker 2:  by which phone you have. But let's pretend just for the sake of this segment

410
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,760
Speaker 2:  that that's not the case. Which of these smart watches is actually

411
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,600
Speaker 2:  the best I brought in Dan Seifert and Victoria Song, who are the

412
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,120
Speaker 2:  two most smart watchy people I know to help me figure it

413
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,630
Speaker 2:  out.

414
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:19,360
Speaker 2:  Time to talk watches. Victoria. Hello?

415
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,180
Speaker 5:  Hello

416
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,440
Speaker 2:  Dan. Hello,

417
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,450
Speaker 6:  Hello.

418
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,970
Speaker 2:  We have reviewed many watches,

419
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:24,900
Speaker 5:  So many watches.

420
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,030
Speaker 2:  You both have all the watches, right? Do we all have all the watches,

421
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,430
Speaker 6:  More watches and wrists?

422
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:34,320
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I don't know what the watch per wrist capita is at my house

423
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:34,910
Speaker 5:  but it's,

424
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,320
Speaker 2:  It's over one for sure.

425
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,080
Speaker 5:  It's like what? 400 to one or 400 to two? Cause I only have two wrists so

426
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,770
Speaker 5:  yeah,

427
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:43,800
Speaker 2:  So I didn't tell either of you this but we have a little game to play basically.

428
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,280
Speaker 2:  So I came up with a bunch of categories which I would say are the things

429
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,760
Speaker 2:  that make up a good smart watch and we're gonna go through each of them and

430
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,480
Speaker 2:  decide between the Pixel watch, the Galaxy Watch and the Apple Watch. And

431
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,400
Speaker 2:  if you have like a weird crazy wild card you wanna throw in, knock

432
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,740
Speaker 2:  yourself out and we're just, we're gonna try to lay out what is best at what

433
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,600
Speaker 2:  and then at the end if there is an obvious winner, great.

434
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,000
Speaker 2:  We don't all have to agree, we're just gonna talk about it and see where

435
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,720
Speaker 2:  we land. So first I'm gonna tell you the categories and you can tell me if

436
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,960
Speaker 2:  there's anything really obvious that I'm missing. Here are all the ones I

437
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,920
Speaker 2:  wrote down. You ready?

438
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,710
Speaker 5:  Ready.

439
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:18,560
Speaker 2:  I have best assistant best for computer things, which I have to be

440
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,240
Speaker 2:  like reminders and smart home and like doing all the little like one touch

441
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,160
Speaker 2:  stuff you wanna do on your phone. Battery life best looking plays

442
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,830
Speaker 2:  best with other devices and you can define that however you'd like to

443
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:33,660
Speaker 2:  best for regular fitness people, best for Super Fitness people

444
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,780
Speaker 2:  and best overall. Those are my categories. How do we feel?

445
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:40,650
Speaker 5:  Are we going into specific models within these categories

446
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:44,600
Speaker 5:  because the answers are different if I have to like consider the Ultra

447
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,560
Speaker 5:  versus the regular series eight versus the se. Same for

448
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,400
Speaker 5:  the Galaxy Watch five Pro versus the standard Galaxy Watch five. So

449
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:52,920
Speaker 5:  there's

450
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,800
Speaker 6:  Only one Pixel watch.

451
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,990
Speaker 5:  Yeah, there's only one Pixel watch

452
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:59,240
Speaker 2:  That's actually good. So we're gonna do, for the sake of this

453
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,160
Speaker 2:  discussion, the ones that are most comparable to the Pixel watch. So it's

454
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,920
Speaker 2:  probably the Apple Watch series eight and the regular Galaxy Watch and the

455
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,570
Speaker 2:  Pixel watch. Otherwise everything just gets too crazy and too complicated.

456
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:14,480
Speaker 2:  Someday we'll like do a Galaxy Watch Pro versus Apple Watch Ultra

457
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,400
Speaker 2:  from like the top of a mountain and it'll be amazing. But for now let's just,

458
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,840
Speaker 2:  yeah we'll do this sort of basic run of the mill. I assume all three of those

459
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,120
Speaker 2:  are gonna be the most popular in their line. So that feels like an okay one

460
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:24,680
Speaker 2:  for us to

461
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,260
Speaker 6:  Do. I got two proposed questions

462
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,170
Speaker 2:  Hit me

463
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:32,160
Speaker 6:  Comfort and like band compatibility

464
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,580
Speaker 6:  slash options.

465
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,000
Speaker 2:  Yes.

466
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,880
Speaker 5:  Okay. And then I guess the only category I would suggest is like

467
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,840
Speaker 5:  advanced health features cuz health and wellness tracking versus

468
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,900
Speaker 5:  fitness tracking, they are different things.

469
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,720
Speaker 2:  Ooh, okay, I'm good with that. Let's just dive into this in I would say relatively

470
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,640
Speaker 2:  no particular order best looking of

471
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,280
Speaker 2:  the three of them. I feel like this is, this is gonna be a tricky one

472
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,670
Speaker 5:  Pixel watch for me.

473
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:58,950
Speaker 6:  Yeah I'm gonna go with Pixel Watch as well even though I think it's too small.

474
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:59,440
Speaker 6:  Okay,

475
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,080
Speaker 2:  This is not a tricky one. I also agree. I think it's, they just like they

476
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,330
Speaker 2:  did the thing that's like what a watch is supposed to look like.

477
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:09,120
Speaker 6:  It looks very pretty like I think it's distinct enough that it doesn't look

478
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,080
Speaker 6:  like it's trying to ape an analog watch, which I think the Galaxy

479
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,760
Speaker 6:  watch suffers from a little bit like I don't think the Apple Watch is very

480
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,640
Speaker 6:  pretty at all. I think it's very functional and comfortable or whatever,

481
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,400
Speaker 6:  but the square shape is just, you know a lot of people complain about that.

482
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,720
Speaker 6:  So I think that the Pixel watch nails that and it is like a nice felt

483
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,360
Speaker 6:  size that tapers and the curves make it

484
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,320
Speaker 6:  hide whatever size it has really well. So I don't know, I

485
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,630
Speaker 6:  think I dig the look.

486
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:38,200
Speaker 5:  Yeah I would agree with that. And it looks modern, you know it's, it's sort

487
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,160
Speaker 5:  of, I don't know, Samsung's watches are really nice looking out of the box.

488
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,920
Speaker 5:  That's true. But it is not what I would call like

489
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,310
Speaker 5:  elegant. Yeah like you, you kind of need to dress it up a bit with

490
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:52,640
Speaker 5:  straps and it's the same thing for the Apple Watch just out of the box the

491
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,160
Speaker 5:  Apple watch is like hello tiny wrist calculator computer on your wrist. I

492
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,040
Speaker 5:  mean it's nice but you have to buy a really nice strap to kind of dress it

493
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,770
Speaker 5:  up. Whereas I actually think that the Pixel watch is

494
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:07,640
Speaker 5:  default band. It looks really pretty just it

495
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,090
Speaker 5:  does. And then if you've seen the mesh straps like the metal mesh straps,

496
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:14,870
Speaker 5:  it is gorgeous. I was, I was in the hands on like oh my god

497
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:17,640
Speaker 5:  I really want this. And then I saw the price and I was like no okay, it's

498
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,400
Speaker 2:  Fine. Yeah, I was gonna say it's really nice. It's stupid expensive but it's

499
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,840
Speaker 2:  really nice. Yeah. All right, well then I think, yeah I think we're all in

500
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,640
Speaker 2:  agreement. For me it's like it's just the right amount of watchy like you

501
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,480
Speaker 2:  said Dan, it's not trying to do some of the things that like the fossils

502
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,560
Speaker 2:  of the world have done where they try to like sneak technology into a regular

503
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,400
Speaker 2:  watch, like look like a smart watch. That's okay and the Pixel watch does

504
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,320
Speaker 2:  do that, but it also doesn't look like they shrunk

505
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,520
Speaker 2:  an iPhone and put a band on it and put it on your wrist, which is like the

506
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,880
Speaker 2:  Apple watch is a very nice device but it is, you would never mistake it for

507
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,360
Speaker 2:  anything other than what it is. And I feel like the Pixel Watch walks that

508
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,600
Speaker 2:  line very well. Okay, three points for the pixel watch big day. I don't know

509
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,480
Speaker 2:  if we're actually keeping score, but I'm just gonna write all these down.

510
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,290
Speaker 2:  See what happens related to that

511
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:02,560
Speaker 2:  is Best wearability. So this is the one, Dan, you just brought up this mix

512
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,320
Speaker 2:  of like comfort on your wrist and also the like band

513
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,240
Speaker 2:  and accessory ecosystem. All of the stuff you can put on when you put it

514
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,400
Speaker 2:  on

515
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,690
Speaker 5:  Apple Watch.

516
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:15,560
Speaker 6:  So I think for comfort they're all the same. They're all pretty

517
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:19,450
Speaker 6:  comfortable like and and I think what impacts the comfort most

518
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:23,160
Speaker 6:  is which strap you choose on it and out of the box if you were, we were just

519
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,920
Speaker 6:  go to like the default one you pick up off the shelf, they all come with

520
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,760
Speaker 6:  very similar rubbery sport straps that all

521
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,560
Speaker 6:  feel basically the same. So then it becomes like, well which

522
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,440
Speaker 6:  one can you customize the easiest? And that

523
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,080
Speaker 6:  I think the pixel watch is instantly disqualified because it has the fewest

524
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,860
Speaker 6:  number of strap options and they are using a proprietary mount

525
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,360
Speaker 6:  and it's brand new so there's no third party options or

526
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,280
Speaker 2:  Whatever so, and they're very expensive. Google for some reason made all

527
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,280
Speaker 2:  of these very expensive.

528
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,840
Speaker 6:  Yeah and like I like leather watch straps for my straps and the leather ones

529
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,760
Speaker 6:  are just really not that great. So pixel watch is disqualified,

530
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,120
Speaker 5:  The other ones aren't either. No, it's like I've got this, they sent me

531
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,960
Speaker 5:  the woven one and I really have to stress, so like

532
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,920
Speaker 5:  there's two kind of fabricy ones for the pixel watch and one is like the

533
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,900
Speaker 5:  stretchy one that they were like all gung ho about during the presentation

534
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,160
Speaker 5:  and then there's this woven one which they're like, oh yeah this woven one

535
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,920
Speaker 5:  is here too. And it is stiff. It is light is the stiff as a board

536
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,680
Speaker 5:  like exactly that it's, it's really weird feeling. I like it looks

537
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:26,590
Speaker 5:  fine but it feels odd. Yeah and like the way you

538
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:30,440
Speaker 5:  secure the bands onto your wrist itself, they're weird. It's got this button

539
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,490
Speaker 5:  and I don't like it.

540
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:34,920
Speaker 6:  So then you gotta like compare this, this Samsung and the Apple watch and

541
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,480
Speaker 6:  Samsung has an advantage that they use standard watch pin

542
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,400
Speaker 6:  size that's been around for ages. It's super easy to, you can walk into like

543
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,360
Speaker 6:  almost any watch store or on Amazon super easily find a a strap

544
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,720
Speaker 6:  design that you like that will fit this watch very easily. And then the Apple

545
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,400
Speaker 6:  watch because it's been a market leader for so long, basically has the same

546
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,080
Speaker 6:  scenario because so many third party options exist for it. You can buy I

547
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,520
Speaker 6:  one of Apple's watch straps which are really nice. I think they're really

548
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,360
Speaker 6:  all overpriced and you should just go find a third party option but you do

549
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:08,280
Speaker 6:  have like a wide variety of options there so it's a little bit

550
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,170
Speaker 6:  of a toss up between the two. I think that because the Samsung

551
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:16,040
Speaker 6:  is round and uses a standard watch strap, it's a little bit

552
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,880
Speaker 6:  easier to get that watch style look from it compared to

553
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,780
Speaker 6:  the Apple watch

554
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:23,920
Speaker 2:  The, Tell me why you shook your head when Dan was describing the standard

555
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,280
Speaker 2:  watch sizes cuz that's also I would give it to Samsung for the exact reason

556
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,560
Speaker 2:  he just described that it just works with watch bands, which seems

557
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,070
Speaker 2:  like insane that not others do this.

558
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:37,050
Speaker 5:  Yeah so I'm gonna go with the fact that it is much easier to slide on

559
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:41,000
Speaker 5:  an Apple watch strap third party or not because like I

560
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,520
Speaker 5:  really don't think it's hard to get a third party one that makes it look,

561
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,360
Speaker 5:  you know, you can dress it up. There's bracelet types, there's leather types,

562
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,000
Speaker 5:  there's metal types, they're out there. I can't tell you how many manicures

563
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,840
Speaker 5:  I've ruined just trying to change the pins and cuz you know

564
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,120
Speaker 5:  that's part of doing a smart watch review, just how easy is it to swap out

565
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,970
Speaker 5:  the pins and they're so small. I have broken so many nails

566
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:05,080
Speaker 5:  on it and I do my own manicures so it's just like

567
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,990
Speaker 5:  ah duh, I spend so much time on that. Yeah,

568
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:11,880
Speaker 6:  I agree that the Apple watch, if you are the type of person that's going

569
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,720
Speaker 6:  to switch their strap any more than once a month, the Apple watch is just

570
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,350
Speaker 6:  so much easier.

571
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:19,120
Speaker 5:  Yeah and if you're doing fitness stuff, right? I don't know if you've ever

572
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,000
Speaker 5:  seen Alex Krantz is most disgusting leather strap that she wore for a

573
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,800
Speaker 5:  very long time. If you do any sort of fitness and you don't have

574
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,440
Speaker 5:  a leather strap with a silicone underside, you have to switch that thing

575
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,200
Speaker 5:  out for like hygiene reasons.

576
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,270
Speaker 2:  Yeah it gets real nasty.

577
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:36,280
Speaker 5:  That picture haunts my dreams. It's so disgusting.

578
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,400
Speaker 5:  Anyway,

579
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,000
Speaker 2:  All right. Okay. You've talked me into it. Yeah I think if it was just band

580
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,880
Speaker 2:  ecosystem, I think it's Samsung by a mile even though it

581
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,960
Speaker 2:  is definitely true that there are like a million great Etsy stores that will

582
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,840
Speaker 2:  sell you very good Apple watch bands. That is definitely true. But I think

583
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,510
Speaker 2:  you're right for like day to day wearable ness,

584
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,370
Speaker 2:  it's probably the Apple Watch.

585
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:59,760
Speaker 5:  Oh and I gotta mention the Pixel Watch's proprietary band

586
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,710
Speaker 5:  mechanism requires a degree in physics to learn how to use.

587
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:06,960
Speaker 2:  You're saying it's not like twisting on a camera lens, whatever that means.

588
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,670
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

589
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,960
Speaker 5:  I mean you saw me in the office just losing my mind trying to figure out

590
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,880
Speaker 5:  the trick to it. Once you figure out the trick it's like, oh I'm an

591
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,600
Speaker 5:  idiot. This is really easy and satisfying to click into place.

592
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,160
Speaker 5:  But learning it and like it clicking into your hand, into your head

593
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,990
Speaker 5:  rather, there were Google reps at the demo who were like,

594
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:29,920
Speaker 5:  just give me a second I, I'm gonna figure this out. So it's, it's sort

595
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,520
Speaker 5:  of like Uhuh, it

596
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,760
Speaker 6:  Feels a bit over-engineered.

597
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,480
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's so weird coming from

598
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,220
Speaker 2:  Google.

599
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,920
Speaker 2:  The next category, I have a feeling this is gonna be the one we get through

600
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,800
Speaker 2:  the quickest and agree on the fastest is best virtual assistant. So

601
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,440
Speaker 2:  we have Bixby, we have Google Assistant and we have Siri. It's just Google

602
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,430
Speaker 2:  assistant, right? We don't even need to talk about this,

603
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:54,040
Speaker 6:  I disagree. Oh really? It's Bixby. No I'm, I'm it's

604
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,820
Speaker 6:  not. I think and this is like highly

605
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:01,650
Speaker 6:  contextually specific, I think that Siri on the watch

606
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:05,200
Speaker 6:  is better than Google assistant on the Android

607
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,160
Speaker 6:  watches and the main reason is it's so much easier to use

608
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:13,000
Speaker 6:  and for the things that I use Siri on my watch for, it's actually very

609
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,760
Speaker 6:  good at the things that Siri's not good at is like figuring

610
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,680
Speaker 6:  out how tall the Eiffel Tower is or other random facts or

611
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,520
Speaker 6:  whatever. Like it's, it consistently fails at that and like that doesn't

612
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:28,000
Speaker 6:  change but I don't really ask my watch that very often the things I ask for

613
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,960
Speaker 6:  on my watch are to set timers to turn on and off my lights and to

614
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,880
Speaker 6:  like set an alarm or I ask at the weather maybe or I send

615
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,760
Speaker 6:  a message and all of those things work really well with Siri and I,

616
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,400
Speaker 6:  all I have to do is hold it up to my mouth and start speaking and it

617
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,940
Speaker 6:  instantly transcribes it and does the thing really quickly. Whereas with

618
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,830
Speaker 6:  the Google Assistant or hey g, I have to say hey G,

619
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:54,680
Speaker 6:  wait for it to like react and know that it's listening, speak what I

620
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,010
Speaker 6:  wanna speak and then have it do it which always has a longer processing time.

621
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:01,730
Speaker 6:  So for me it's Siri on the watch is actually a better experience.

622
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:05,560
Speaker 2:  So there's like a theoretical universe that exists in which I completely

623
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,920
Speaker 2:  agree with everything that you just said but my experience with Siri is that

624
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,680
Speaker 2:  Siri just full fails about same 40% of the

625
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,600
Speaker 2:  time. I hope I pull the thing up, like you said, it's great user interface,

626
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,520
Speaker 2:  pull it up to my mouth, say the thing, you know I use it for like reminders

627
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,680
Speaker 2:  a ton just like anything that comes into my brain just like it goes into

628
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,400
Speaker 2:  reminders and truly like two outta five times it

629
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,360
Speaker 2:  doesn't even finish the process. It just goes like one moment

630
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,520
Speaker 2:  still working and then it says I'm sorry please try again. And I'm like I

631
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,080
Speaker 2:  already forgot what I wanted sir. Like

632
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,920
Speaker 6:  I get that on home pods all the time but on my watch it like is way

633
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,290
Speaker 6:  more reliable and what I experience with the Google assistant

634
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:45,120
Speaker 6:  is it doesn't hear me say hey gee, like I have to say

635
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,800
Speaker 6:  that like three times for it to like grab it and the watch has to be like

636
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,640
Speaker 6:  awake. So I have to do the motion, I have to say the thing, I have to make

637
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,520
Speaker 6:  sure it's heard me say the thing and then I have to say my command. So it's

638
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,750
Speaker 6:  like the whole process of it just like turns me off to it.

639
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:02,680
Speaker 5:  That's so funny because I use the digital assistant on the watch in a

640
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,200
Speaker 5:  completely different manner. I never use the wake words. I always, you know,

641
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,160
Speaker 5:  do the the hard quoted show shortcut. It's just way more reliable for

642
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,510
Speaker 5:  me. But also the reason why I'm going to give the

643
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:17,480
Speaker 5:  Google Assistant the win here is that it understands me better and

644
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,080
Speaker 5:  just in general is able to understand ethnic names better,

645
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:25,000
Speaker 5:  which is relevant to my life when I'm like, hey send emo a

646
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,830
Speaker 5:  text and emo is aunt in Korean and Siri like

647
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:32,550
Speaker 5:  I don't know who IMO is and it's like okay thank you.

648
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:36,480
Speaker 5:  Does not like I had a friend who had a Japanese name in in

649
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,360
Speaker 5:  the past and I was like send Seia a text and they

650
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,950
Speaker 5:  would be like there's no one with that name in your actual

651
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:47,910
Speaker 5:  contacts looks. So I would have to say send CIA

652
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,280
Speaker 5:  a text. Oh

653
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:49,610
Speaker 2:  No.

654
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:53,560
Speaker 5:  So like using Google Assistant in that sense is, is

655
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:57,540
Speaker 5:  a lot easier in my life. The natural language understanding is just better

656
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:00,560
Speaker 5:  but I just think Siri thinks I've mumble, which is very

657
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,910
Speaker 5:  rude.

658
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:05,240
Speaker 6:  Well I mean it's two against one, right? So like I mean Google Assistant

659
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:05,960
Speaker 6:  wins this, right?

660
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,600
Speaker 2:  I guess we're doing it that way. Yeah, Google Assistant technically wins

661
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,560
Speaker 2:  that round. So good. Good job. Google Assistant Dan, congratulations on

662
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,480
Speaker 2:  being like the one person on earth who like Siri gets that feels like it's

663
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,400
Speaker 2:  like a meaningful moment for you. On a

664
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,280
Speaker 2:  related note, and Dan you brought this up a little bit, the next category

665
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,920
Speaker 2:  is the best at computer things. My big theory about Smart Watch is is they're

666
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,240
Speaker 2:  very good at doing all the things that take you three taps on your phone,

667
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,720
Speaker 2:  right? Where it's like changing your lights or setting reminders or

668
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,560
Speaker 2:  quickly like texting a thumbs up emoji to your friend or

669
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,480
Speaker 2:  whatever. I weirdly would've guessed for me that this would

670
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,160
Speaker 2:  be the same answer as assistant, but I made them two separate things because

671
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:47,040
Speaker 2:  I actually think the Apple Watch is better at those things than the

672
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,880
Speaker 2:  Pixel Watch because mostly because it has more apps. Like there's just

673
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,210
Speaker 2:  more stuff I can do on it.

674
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:56,160
Speaker 6:  Exactly same reason. I fully agree, I think the voice assistant has a little

675
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,120
Speaker 6:  bit part of it there, but fundamentally I can use the apps that

676
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,960
Speaker 6:  I use on my computer all the time, more likely on my wrist with the

677
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,400
Speaker 6:  Apple Watch than I can with the Google Watch. There's just way more app

678
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,280
Speaker 6:  ecosystem. It supports way more smart home devices. It

679
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,200
Speaker 6:  supports way more like different to-do list apps. So you can basically choose

680
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,160
Speaker 6:  whichever one you prefer. It's gonna have an Apple Watch version and it

681
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,320
Speaker 6:  will have a good complication for it and things like that. So if you wanna

682
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:26,200
Speaker 6:  see your upcoming to-dos or your upcoming appointments or whatever, the

683
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:30,000
Speaker 6:  complication systems are way more built out so that the watch

684
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,360
Speaker 6:  face is more customizable to show you the information that you care most

685
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,560
Speaker 6:  about than you can get on either Samsung or Google's

686
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,380
Speaker 5:  Watch. I'm gonna agree with that, especially since I think one of the most

687
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:44,160
Speaker 5:  underappreciated things you can use an Apple watch for is as a

688
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,080
Speaker 5:  two-factor authentication or just yes. Yep. That kind of device. It has

689
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,700
Speaker 5:  made my life so easy just to pull up like

690
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:55,150
Speaker 5:  one password just released a like an Apple watch

691
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:58,920
Speaker 5:  update and it is like wow you mean I can just

692
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,680
Speaker 5:  pull up my Octa password super easily. Amazing. This is great for

693
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,240
Speaker 5:  work but getting apps onto the Apple watch is

694
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,750
Speaker 5:  seamless. You know Google's been fragmented for so long

695
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:13,450
Speaker 5:  that it's, it's like different watches getting the apps

696
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:17,160
Speaker 5:  on there, it's not always the same experience and it's

697
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,960
Speaker 5:  same for Samsung and for the Pixel watch. Yeah it's just they're not

698
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,230
Speaker 5:  terrible, it's just Apple does it better.

699
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:27,080
Speaker 6:  Yeah, Apple also integrates the watch into

700
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,840
Speaker 6:  these iPhone software a lot closer and tighter. So like now with Iowa

701
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:34,600
Speaker 6:  16 a watch was nine, you can have a different watch face show up for your

702
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,800
Speaker 6:  work focus versus your personal focus. So like you can have a real chill

703
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,680
Speaker 6:  one for the weekends and then one that's like fully dense with your calendar

704
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,880
Speaker 6:  appointments and to-do lists and things like that. And it automatically changes

705
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,160
Speaker 6:  when it comes to work time. Whereas like on the Samsung watch or the Google

706
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,400
Speaker 6:  Watch, I have to like manually switch between them if I want to have that

707
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,040
Speaker 6:  kind of functionality. So it just, it just feels more helpful in that kind

708
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,400
Speaker 6:  of context of having a computer on my

709
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,320
Speaker 5:  Wrist. And that update was like such a game changer in both iOS 16

710
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:05,240
Speaker 5:  and a watchOS nine. I have so much fun with it. Like I'm just such a

711
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,480
Speaker 5:  nerd with my focus modes and and the the watch I

712
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,370
Speaker 6:  Believe you've written about it, you should go check it out on the verge.com

713
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:12,160
Speaker 6:  vs written about it.

714
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,670
Speaker 5:  It's my call it, this is fine focus mode.

715
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:19,320
Speaker 2:  I do love that everyone should have a, this is fine focus mode for when everything

716
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,720
Speaker 2:  is falling apart but I think we, yeah we all agree we're giving that one

717
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,680
Speaker 2:  the Apple watch. So next one is Battery

718
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,320
Speaker 2:  Life. The, you've tested these

719
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,600
Speaker 2:  things probably most aggressively of the three of us. Is there a clear winner

720
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,360
Speaker 2:  here? It's

721
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,320
Speaker 5:  The Apple Watch. Okay, Apple watch, Samsung Pixel. That's, that's how it's

722
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:35,560
Speaker 5:  gonna go.

723
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:39,240
Speaker 2:  Wait really? You put pixel below Samsung cause Samsung's battery was

724
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,030
Speaker 2:  pretty bleak.

725
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:43,480
Speaker 5:  It's pretty bleak but here's the thing, when you wear the Samsung

726
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,360
Speaker 5:  watch for a longer period of time and you know that's one of my blind

727
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:51,220
Speaker 5:  spots sometimes as a reviewer because I am constantly onto the next,

728
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:55,040
Speaker 5:  but when you do wear the Samsung watch for a longer period of time, the battery

729
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,720
Speaker 5:  life gets better. So that's shocking. It's not that

730
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,710
Speaker 5:  much better but it gets better.

731
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:01,300
Speaker 2:  Okay.

732
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:05,080
Speaker 6:  See Samsung also made forward progress with the Galaxy Watch

733
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,640
Speaker 6:  five versus the Galaxy Watch four. So like even just the newer model this

734
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,040
Speaker 6:  year has has noticeably better battery life and whereas if you've

735
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,760
Speaker 6:  read v's Pixel watch review, it's just

736
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,360
Speaker 6:  making

737
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,400
Speaker 2:  It, it's tough. If

738
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,240
Speaker 6:  You have any variety in your routine, you might not have enough battery

739
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,120
Speaker 6:  life by the end of the

740
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,880
Speaker 5:  Day. Yeah. Just for context, I went on my long run which was about

741
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,840
Speaker 5:  55 minutes. I did not use an offline playlist, I just went on

742
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:33,760
Speaker 5:  the run with the GPS tracking and always on display just for the run mind

743
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,720
Speaker 5:  you cuz you can do that and it went down like

744
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,560
Speaker 5:  25%. Oof. Normally on other watches it's not gonna go down

745
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,430
Speaker 5:  25%.

746
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:45,000
Speaker 6:  I feel like we do have to set the context here that we are only comparing

747
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,640
Speaker 6:  against these three watches. Yes. And there are like Fitbits and

748
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,800
Speaker 6:  garments and all this kinda stuff that will have like way longer battery

749
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,520
Speaker 6:  life than the Apple Watch. We're not saying the Apple Watch is like the best

750
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,160
Speaker 6:  watch battery life, but at these three it is the most reliable and consistent

751
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,000
Speaker 6:  and predictable and you will get a longer period of time, especially if

752
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,840
Speaker 6:  you're doing stuff like sleep tracking and wearing it 24 hours a day and

753
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,200
Speaker 6:  stuff like that. You will more reliably experience better, better life on

754
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:09,640
Speaker 6:  the Apple watch.

755
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,760
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's a good note. I think this is probably the first category for

756
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:16,270
Speaker 2:  which like if this is the most important thing to, you don't buy any of these.

757
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:19,360
Speaker 5:  Yeah, yeah. Well you could get the Ultra

758
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,220
Speaker 6:  You could, You could get the Ultra

759
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:24,200
Speaker 2:  But even still you could get a Garmin that's gonna last you like days and

760
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,760
Speaker 2:  days you could get a fit that's gonna last you days and days. Like if battery

761
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,860
Speaker 2:  life is like your main thing, this, these are the wrong answer,

762
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:30,790
Speaker 2:  but

763
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:34,550
Speaker 6:  They don't do anything like they, they're great for like fitness

764
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:38,080
Speaker 6:  tracking and like workouts and things like that. But if you wanted any of

765
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,640
Speaker 6:  the stuff we just talk about for like computer assistance stuff, they

766
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,800
Speaker 6:  are terrible. Like, like they're just non-starters for me as as someone who

767
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,200
Speaker 6:  like prefers that stuff. So like it's a completely different concept to me.

768
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:48,600
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

769
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,480
Speaker 5:  It's your priorities. A Garmin has the most, I think,

770
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,120
Speaker 5:  smart features of any of the, you know, fitness tracker e

771
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,240
Speaker 5:  watches. It's not great Bob. It's just not

772
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,190
Speaker 5:  great.

773
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:03,920
Speaker 2:  Yeah, there you go. Okay, so we'll give that one to the Apple watch but with

774
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,000
Speaker 2:  like there's like an asterisk next to this one. This is the, the not great

775
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,610
Speaker 2:  Bob Asterisk. Okay. The next category

776
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:14,400
Speaker 2:  is plays best with other devices. And you can define this

777
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,280
Speaker 2:  however you'd like. Whether it's like tight compatibility or like

778
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,490
Speaker 2:  works with lots of different things. Where do we land?

779
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:23,710
Speaker 5:  Oh god, they're all bad.

780
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:27,000
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that was one of the reasons I brought this up. Yeah,

781
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,520
Speaker 5:  They're all pushing an ecosystem agenda. It's hard because I

782
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:34,360
Speaker 5:  think you could say Apple because it works with like within

783
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:38,320
Speaker 5:  the Apple ecosystem really well with different devices. You have

784
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:42,000
Speaker 5:  that third party ecosystem that Dan mentioned very, very good,

785
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,950
Speaker 5:  but it's for iPhone users only, so it's kinda

786
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:49,840
Speaker 5:  a nonstarter. But then again Samsung and the Pixel Watch right now

787
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,800
Speaker 5:  are for Android users only. So what are you gonna do there?

788
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,720
Speaker 5:  And then of the two between the, the Pixel Watch and the

789
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:01,660
Speaker 5:  Galaxy watches, it's, I don't know, do you want a choice between BPI

790
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:05,610
Speaker 5:  and Google Assistant? Is that a choice that you want to have?

791
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:09,560
Speaker 5:  Do you wanna choose between Samsung Pay and Google Wallet so you

792
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:13,280
Speaker 5:  have more choice. It's just whether you want those like main

793
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,240
Speaker 5:  functionality choices. So it's like they're all

794
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,200
Speaker 6:  Bad. I will say if you, if we are simplifying this to

795
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,080
Speaker 6:  like works with the most phones because you, you can't use any of these

796
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:27,040
Speaker 6:  standalone, you have to pair it to a phone. Even if you get the LTE models,

797
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,760
Speaker 6:  you're still relying on a phone works with the most phones is the Pixel

798
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,120
Speaker 6:  watch. Yep. Because it will work the same with any Android phone, whether

799
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:38,080
Speaker 6:  you have a Pixel or a Samsung phone or what other Android phones

800
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:42,040
Speaker 6:  are there. Well, a OnePlus, a nothing phone, whatever it might be. It'll

801
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,840
Speaker 6:  work the same in that context. The Samsung watches will work with other Android

802
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,480
Speaker 6:  phones, but they will only have certain features available on

803
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,440
Speaker 6:  Samsung phones. So you have to be in the Samsung ecosystem V correct me

804
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,250
Speaker 6:  if I'm wrong, to get like ECG working on Yes. A Samsung watch.

805
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:00,240
Speaker 6:  Whereas the Pixel watch will work with any Android phone with that feature.

806
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,080
Speaker 6:  Yep. And then obviously the iPhone or the Apple watch only works with iPhones

807
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,280
Speaker 6:  and it has to be paired to an iPhone. You cannot pair it to an iPad, you

808
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,010
Speaker 6:  cannot use it standalone. You have to use it as with an iPhone.

809
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:14,880
Speaker 6:  So in that respect I would give it to the Pixel watch, but I think vi's first

810
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,800
Speaker 6:  point about like if you aren't using an Apple watch, it works with

811
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,310
Speaker 6:  more things within that ecosystem, better

812
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:25,920
Speaker 6:  than the Pixel Watch or the Samsung Watches Zoo. Like you can pair Pixel

813
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,580
Speaker 6:  Buds to a Pixel Watch and Samsung Buds to a Samsung watch

814
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:33,400
Speaker 6:  and your AirPods to an Apple Watch. But I can connect it

815
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,080
Speaker 6:  to my home kit home and I can connect it to Apple TV

816
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,960
Speaker 6:  and I can, there's, and like Apple Fitness works well across my Apple TV

817
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,400
Speaker 6:  with my iPad and all this. So like if you're bought into that, it works very

818
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,270
Speaker 6:  well. But if you are not into the Apple ecosystem at all,

819
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:50,350
Speaker 6:  then the Apple Watch is a nonstarter.

820
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:54,280
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I feel like the tie goes to the Pixel watch here just because Android

821
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,980
Speaker 2:  is like a larger ecosystem of more things

822
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:01,960
Speaker 2:  and you literally have to own one device in order

823
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,880
Speaker 2:  for your Apple watch to work. Yep. And at least Google is giving

824
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,520
Speaker 2:  you some more choices. But I agree the, the, the real answer here is they

825
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,040
Speaker 2:  all suck And it's like, it's ridiculous that like, like I have an Apple Watch

826
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,960
Speaker 2:  and a Mac and they in no way are useful to each other. What

827
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,010
Speaker 6:  Do you mean you don't, you don't unlock your Mac with your Apple watch?

828
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:20,380
Speaker 2:  No,

829
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:24,240
Speaker 6:  You don't use the Mac notoriously reliable Bluetooth connection to

830
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,330
Speaker 6:  unlock it with your watch.

831
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:27,050
Speaker 2:  Oh my God. Kill me.

832
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:28,280
Speaker 5:  It works fine for me.

833
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,240
Speaker 2:  Touch ID on MacBooks. Wonderful touch Id huge win

834
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:36,200
Speaker 2:  on MacBooks. I could type a 65 paragraph password in

835
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,120
Speaker 2:  the amount of time it takes my Apple watch to unlock my MacBook most of the

836
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:39,240
Speaker 2:  time.

837
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,190
Speaker 5:  That's so weird. It works so well for me. That's,

838
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:43,920
Speaker 6:  I I had to turn it off. It was, it

839
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,960
Speaker 2:  Was too flaky. Must be nice V must be nice. All right, we're getting this

840
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,800
Speaker 2:  one of the Pixel watch. We're gonna move on now we're getting

841
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,560
Speaker 2:  into fitness and health categories. The first one is best for regular

842
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:58,440
Speaker 2:  fitness people. You're just like, you're a person who wants to like

843
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,900
Speaker 2:  get their steps and make sure they're not dying. Who wins?

844
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,750
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna give it to the Pixel Watch.

845
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:03,670
Speaker 2:  Really

846
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:07,320
Speaker 5:  I have reasons for this. It's like so many, so many

847
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,040
Speaker 5:  caveats here cuz we're talking about the average person, right? So when I

848
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,320
Speaker 5:  think about the average person, I'm thinking about someone who is, you know,

849
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,900
Speaker 5:  looking to increase their activity in a way that's holistic and makes sense.

850
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:20,680
Speaker 5:  And I have a lot of issues with how Apple does this

851
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:24,600
Speaker 5:  obsessive streak and closing your

852
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,570
Speaker 5:  ring stuff like it's great, don't, don't get me wrong, it's great.

853
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:31,520
Speaker 2:  It is a bully. Like my, my rings are very passive aggressive. Like

854
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,760
Speaker 2:  I wake up every morning and it's like, it's like hey, hey dip shit you only

855
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,800
Speaker 2:  closed one of your rings yesterday. Maybe, maybe do better today maybe. I

856
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,640
Speaker 2:  don't know. You probably can't but maybe try. That'd be

857
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:43,600
Speaker 6:  Good. I love getting the alert at seven 30 at night. It's like only a 27

858
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,320
Speaker 6:  minute Bri call and it's like Apple

859
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,560
Speaker 6:  watch, I've been wearing you for seven years, you know I'm not going for

860
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:50,680
Speaker 6:  that

861
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,360
Speaker 2:  Wall. I've never done this once. Leave me alone.

862
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,800
Speaker 5:  Yeah, so like to get into that, it is a very real thing

863
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,640
Speaker 5:  where Apple will always push you to do more, faster, better. And

864
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,600
Speaker 5:  that's not always the best thing for you. Like at one

865
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,840
Speaker 5:  point I was getting into where, where I was like you need to have 3000 minutes

866
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:11,480
Speaker 5:  of exercise to get this month's badge. And I was like I will die. I will

867
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:15,400
Speaker 5:  literally die if you ask me to do that this month and now you're making

868
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,640
Speaker 5:  me break my streak. And it's very bad for your mental health in a certain

869
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,320
Speaker 5:  respect and it requires a lot of discipline to not get pulled into

870
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,920
Speaker 5:  that. Whereas, you know, Fitbit used to be like that. It was

871
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,840
Speaker 5:  really kind of similar in a while. But they have since made moves to

872
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,800
Speaker 5:  be a little more holistic that I think are great if you are just new

873
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,720
Speaker 5:  and easily demotivated. So like they use active

874
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,360
Speaker 5:  zone minutes, which is, you know, it's, it's better than this. Whatever move

875
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:45,060
Speaker 5:  ring is like I whatever the active zone minutes,

876
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:48,720
Speaker 5:  you get a certain number of like I'll call them points

877
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,640
Speaker 5:  based on your heart rate activity and it corresponds to the 150

878
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,880
Speaker 5:  minutes of moderate activity you're supposed to get according to the American

879
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,800
Speaker 5:  Heart Association. So it's a lot more forgiving. You don't have

880
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,360
Speaker 5:  to get streaks going, you can just look at your weekly average and go, Oh

881
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,720
Speaker 5:  you know what? I've been really sedentary this week, let me kick it up this

882
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,430
Speaker 5:  last two days. And that's better than nothing. You have

883
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:14,240
Speaker 5:  a daily readiness score. So that's going to at least get you thinking

884
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,880
Speaker 5:  about recovery, which is also really important. You're not gonna push yourself

885
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:21,320
Speaker 5:  and demotivate yourself by getting injured. You have stress management that

886
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,440
Speaker 5:  is like not great on the Pixel watch compared to the other Fitbits. This

887
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,680
Speaker 5:  is the whole thing. You can read my Fitbit Sense two review and my Pixel

888
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,760
Speaker 5:  watch review to get the whole picture of it. It's, I'm really mad about it.

889
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:34,480
Speaker 5:  But at the same time, just overall I, I think Fitbit

890
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,230
Speaker 5:  has a smarter, more experienced approach to how to get people to do

891
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:42,070
Speaker 5:  health and wellness and Samsung's a nonstarter.

892
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:45,840
Speaker 6:  I think Samsung's suffers from, it's a poor copy of whatever

893
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,660
Speaker 6:  Apple is doing. And so like Apple's is problematic to begin with

894
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:53,560
Speaker 6:  and then Samsung tries to clone it basically and then they don't even get

895
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:57,160
Speaker 6:  as far as Apple gets. And so you know, if you use the Samsung watch for tracking

896
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:00,440
Speaker 6:  your health, it'll do it. It'll do all the same features. It even the one

897
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:04,120
Speaker 6:  knock against the Pixel watch is that it doesn't automatically start a workout

898
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,440
Speaker 6:  for you. The Samsung watch and the Apple Watch will do that and things like

899
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,390
Speaker 6:  that. But I think V is right that I have liked the

900
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:15,240
Speaker 6:  better, more holistic approach that the Fitbit software

901
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,960
Speaker 6:  on the Pixel watch is offering over the other

902
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,880
Speaker 2:  Two. Okay, I love it. I have no qualms. Pixel watch wins this one good

903
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,720
Speaker 2:  for pixel watch. Okay and now best

904
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,680
Speaker 2:  for Super Fitness people which is like you are a person who like

905
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,190
Speaker 2:  whole ass cares about being fit and

906
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:35,600
Speaker 2:  runs. I don't even know the words to use cause I am not this person but you

907
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,880
Speaker 2:  are a, you are a fitness person Apple Watch, okay, I feel like this isn't

908
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,550
Speaker 2:  even close, right?

909
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:43,520
Speaker 5:  It's really not. And then again I'm gonna put an asterisk because the Garmin

910
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,460
Speaker 5:  people, this is for people who are kind of intermediate level

911
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:51,070
Speaker 5:  and still want smart features but still care a lot about fitness.

912
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:54,040
Speaker 2:  Once every 10 minutes in a smart watch discussion you have to acknowledge

913
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:57,500
Speaker 2:  that Garmin exists. So consider this the acknowledgement that Garmin exists,

914
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:01,440
Speaker 5:  The acknowledgement that there are hardcore yes rugged sports

915
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,180
Speaker 5:  watches out there and that none of these, this is not gonna hold a candle.

916
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:08,920
Speaker 5:  But if we're going between like the smart quote unquote watches,

917
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,520
Speaker 5:  Apple is just gonna win here because the accuracy is

918
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:16,480
Speaker 5:  better. It actually is more accurate according to this like fascinating

919
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,640
Speaker 5:  YouTube video. You should look it up. It's more accurate with your sleep

920
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:23,320
Speaker 5:  tracking data even though like the presentation of it isn't great than the

921
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:27,080
Speaker 5:  Fitbit is. So like wow cool, you want the most accurate data of these

922
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:30,840
Speaker 5:  three? I'm gonna give it to Apple. Especially with GPS tracking.

923
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,560
Speaker 5:  Like I, you can again look at some of my more recent reviews

924
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:38,120
Speaker 5:  where you see the GPS tracking the Pixel watch versus the Apple

925
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:42,040
Speaker 5:  watches and the GPS maps I got were bad. It's a known

926
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:45,640
Speaker 5:  issue. Fitbit is working to fix it but I went for this

927
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:49,240
Speaker 5:  run and the Pixel watch map stopped a whole

928
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:53,120
Speaker 5:  1000 feet ish before the others and I was like so weird.

929
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:57,050
Speaker 5:  This is crap. I ran that. This is

930
00:54:57,050 --> 00:54:58,330
Speaker 5:  bs. Give me my credit.

931
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:01,440
Speaker 2:  My favorite is the part where you go on a run and I guess you go like under

932
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,240
Speaker 2:  a bridge or up some stairs or something. Yeah. And and the Apple watch

933
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:09,000
Speaker 2:  is like, yes V you ran up some stairs and Google

934
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,800
Speaker 2:  is you, you ran 11 miles back and forth randomly for

935
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,110
Speaker 2:  six minutes and we don't know what happened.

936
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:18,680
Speaker 5:  Yeah it's just, it's you know, just as a caveat, GPS tracking

937
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:22,640
Speaker 5:  is GPS tracking. If you're a city runner and you're going, so I

938
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:26,620
Speaker 5:  run up four flights of indoor stairs on my long runs. It's miserable.

939
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:30,400
Speaker 5:  But the GPS maps are, I love looking at them afterwards cuz

940
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,830
Speaker 5:  they're hilarious. They're like, you're in the East River, you've died, you're

941
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:37,550
Speaker 5:  like on the park across the street. I'm like not. But

942
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:41,370
Speaker 5:  yeah, so Fitbit accuracy wise, it's enough

943
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:45,190
Speaker 5:  to track your, like it's consistent enough, you can track your progress but

944
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:48,960
Speaker 5:  I wouldn't call it the most accurate. I would actually encourage you

945
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,790
Speaker 5:  to do more so that when you go for a race or whatever,

946
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:56,360
Speaker 5:  you're not like what is this I trained exactly according to this

947
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:00,240
Speaker 5:  Fitbit. And then suddenly there's an extra half mile you have to

948
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,190
Speaker 5:  run and you're really angry and dying. Like just tack on extra,

949
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:07,930
Speaker 5:  a little bit extra, not too much but tack on extra. And then Samsung

950
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:11,670
Speaker 5:  is the one thing I'll give Samsung is the body composition analysis.

951
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:15,400
Speaker 5:  That's a thing that the rest don't have, but bioelectric

952
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,660
Speaker 5:  impedance analysis is iffy.

953
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:21,640
Speaker 6:  The, would you say that the Apple watches stronger third party app ecosystem

954
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:25,480
Speaker 6:  also plays a part here. Like I feel like I, I'm coming from this as not

955
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:29,080
Speaker 6:  a advanced athlete or whatever, but I would just assume that like there's

956
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:33,000
Speaker 6:  more apps for training, there's more apps services and things like that available

957
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,830
Speaker 6:  on the Apple Watch than on either of the Android watches.

958
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:39,520
Speaker 5:  It's actually pretty like equal ish. Okay. Now for like the major

959
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,440
Speaker 5:  ones like two years ago I would've told you it was Apple but like you know

960
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,280
Speaker 5:  you can get Strava now on both of these. So like Strava's the big

961
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,000
Speaker 5:  one I think for people, well I guess if you're a hiker, you know there are

962
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,920
Speaker 5:  things like commute to like track your routes. So it's kind of

963
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:55,840
Speaker 5:  equal now.

964
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:56,000
Speaker 6:  Interesting.

965
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,240
Speaker 2:  Cool. Okay. But yeah, I think, I think we're we're right to give that one

966
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:02,200
Speaker 2:  to the Apple watch that, that seems fair. Okay. And then

967
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,280
Speaker 2:  the last category before we get to best overall is the best health stuff,

968
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,260
Speaker 2:  which is all the, all the non fitness but health and wellness tracking stuff.

969
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:13,240
Speaker 2:  And my assumption here would be good first showing from the

970
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:17,200
Speaker 2:  Pixel watch Galaxy does fine but Apple is clearly in the

971
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,840
Speaker 2:  lead here just in part because they've just been doing this for a while now,

972
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:20,720
Speaker 2:  right?

973
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:24,520
Speaker 5:  Apple's in the lead in my opinion. But the gap is closing is how

974
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:28,440
Speaker 5:  I'll say it. Like actually Samsung and Apple are pretty neck and

975
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:32,360
Speaker 5:  neck. It's just that once again there's a little extra polish to the

976
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:36,270
Speaker 5:  way Apple does it versus how Samsung does it. It's just clunkier.

977
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:40,130
Speaker 5:  I think one really good example I can give from the latest round of products

978
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:44,000
Speaker 5:  is temperature tracking. So Fitbits have been able to track

979
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,800
Speaker 5:  skin temperature for a while somehow for some reason you cannot do that on

980
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,320
Speaker 5:  the Pixel watch even though ostensibly you could have stuck the the

981
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:55,080
Speaker 5:  stupid hardware in there. Samsung added temperature tracking to

982
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,960
Speaker 5:  their new watches. But it does absolutely nothing as of right

983
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,700
Speaker 5:  now. So why is it there future proofing? Cool. Apple

984
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:06,640
Speaker 5:  has also added skin temperature sensing and it at least does

985
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:10,360
Speaker 5:  something with advanced cycle tracking. So yeah,

986
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:13,970
Speaker 5:  like that's kind of a really good illustrative

987
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:16,610
Speaker 5:  example of why it is that way.

988
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:19,490
Speaker 6:  So the Apple Watch is the only one that has like fall detection?

989
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:21,400
Speaker 5:  No, Samsung has fall detection as well. Samsung

990
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,080
Speaker 6:  Does. Okay. And

991
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,720
Speaker 2:  Google will in 2023 would really like you to

992
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,640
Speaker 2:  know that's very important that Google tells you

993
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,430
Speaker 2:  that it will happen in 2023.

994
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:34,280
Speaker 6:  What's interesting to me about the Pixel Watch is that they talk a

995
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:38,160
Speaker 6:  lot about how it does the per second heart rate tracking all

996
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,400
Speaker 6:  the time and they went really on and on about that. And then they don't have

997
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,760
Speaker 6:  a feature to tell you when you have an elevated heart rate when you probably

998
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,200
Speaker 6:  aren't supposed to. Whereas I know Samsung does that. Apple's been doing

999
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:52,080
Speaker 6:  that for a long time. It'll tell you about arrhythmia and things like

1000
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,760
Speaker 6:  that. Other, other possible concern areas that the, the Pixel watch

1001
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,600
Speaker 6:  doesn't do. But it does feel like the fact that the Apple Watch has is

1002
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:03,560
Speaker 6:  we're on the eighth generation of the Apple Watch is, is really

1003
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:07,200
Speaker 6:  helping add out because every year they add one or two more of these things

1004
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,200
Speaker 6:  and they just kind of cumulatively stack

1005
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,400
Speaker 2:  Up. And for me it's, it's that proactive stuff that you're talking about

1006
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,320
Speaker 2:  that I think is a big deal. Like Neil, I was harping on this on the show

1007
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:19,500
Speaker 2:  last week that like the pixel watch can't tell that you're washing your hands

1008
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:23,360
Speaker 2:  and it's like, it's such like a dumb small thing. But Apple is slowly sort

1009
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,960
Speaker 2:  of pressing in this direction of like, okay, we understand what's going on

1010
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,640
Speaker 2:  inside of your body and we're gonna like tell you about it. And it's only

1011
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,760
Speaker 2:  doing it in very small ways and in some ways it's like we can tell you when

1012
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,560
Speaker 2:  you were ovulating a month ago and it's like, what is that? Okay?

1013
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:39,040
Speaker 2:  And like, but we all, we all know what the next actual step is there, but

1014
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,960
Speaker 2:  Apple just seems to be much further down this road of like not only getting

1015
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:45,480
Speaker 2:  this information but sort of telling you what to do about it. Or at least

1016
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:48,880
Speaker 2:  helping you understand what's going on. It feels like it's, it's several

1017
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,570
Speaker 2:  steps ahead on that front. At least in my experience

1018
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:55,240
Speaker 5:  It is. I, I do think the gap is very, very, very slowly

1019
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:58,600
Speaker 5:  starting to close just, just a bit. But it is the things that you mentioned,

1020
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:02,440
Speaker 5:  like well the hand washing timer sometimes thinks you're washing your hands

1021
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:06,120
Speaker 5:  while you're doing the dishes, but it's still gonna start

1022
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:09,040
Speaker 5:  automatically, right? Whereas with Google you have to be like, I'm going

1023
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:12,800
Speaker 5:  to wash my hands before I do that. I'm going to go to the hand washing timer

1024
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:16,500
Speaker 5:  widget and then start it and then do that stuff. So that's just an extra

1025
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:20,480
Speaker 5:  bit of friction there. But the Pixel Watch is also a victim of a

1026
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,720
Speaker 5:  very confused lineup. Like as Dan said, there's some

1027
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:27,640
Speaker 5:  weirdness there where it's like, well you guys are basically a Fitbit, a

1028
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:31,440
Speaker 5:  smarter Fitbit, but you're not including things that Fitbit's been able to

1029
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:35,360
Speaker 5:  do on their less advanced trackers for a lot longer. Like it

1030
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:39,240
Speaker 5:  has an SPO two sensor, but you're not going to get nightly SPO two

1031
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:43,200
Speaker 5:  percentages. You're only gonna get this more obscure graph that you

1032
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:47,010
Speaker 5:  have to like dig through a few menus to find called estimated oxygen variation.

1033
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:50,760
Speaker 5:  So it's like what are you doing here? And the answer is, is that they have

1034
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:54,200
Speaker 5:  a sense too in a verse four and they want people to buy it for whatever reason,

1035
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:58,020
Speaker 5:  but they don't know what to do. So things on both watches are

1036
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:01,230
Speaker 5:  unnecessarily nerfed in a way that's infuriating.

1037
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:05,120
Speaker 2:  Yeah and I think that's helpful. A lot of this stuff, it's like stuff

1038
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,800
Speaker 2:  that happens on your first generation that like you give Google a couple

1039
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,680
Speaker 2:  years and if it's actually serious about pushing on this, they can start

1040
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,380
Speaker 2:  to get some of that stuff right? Yep.

1041
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:18,760
Speaker 2:  All right, so we have finished all of our categories and I think the way

1042
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:22,560
Speaker 2:  this nets out is basically the Apple Watch wins but not

1043
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:26,000
Speaker 2:  by like a gigantic margin, like strong, surprisingly strong showing for the

1044
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:26,500
Speaker 2:  Pixel watch.

1045
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,810
Speaker 6:  The Pixel watch took some wins there like

1046
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:32,350
Speaker 2:  It did. The Galaxy Watch got nothing. I'm sorry to the Galaxy Watch.

1047
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:35,640
Speaker 5:  It's got second best syndrome. It's, it really does.

1048
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:36,120
Speaker 2:  Yeah, totally.

1049
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,770
Speaker 6:  It, it absolutely does. And then there are like, you know, scenarios where

1050
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:43,340
Speaker 6:  it might be the better choice for you, especially if you have a Samsung phone

1051
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:46,320
Speaker 6:  and there's certain things it does better than the Pixel watch. I will say

1052
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:50,200
Speaker 6:  I have a pet peeve with the Pixel watch, it does not have an hourly chime

1053
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:54,120
Speaker 6:  feature. So I'm so used to the Apple Watch and the Samsung watch buzzing

1054
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:57,080
Speaker 6:  on my wrist every hour and it helps me keep track and stay on time and the

1055
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,240
Speaker 6:  Pixel watch doesn't have that. So for the entire week I was wearing the pixel

1056
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:02,630
Speaker 6:  watch I like, like was losing track of time all over the place.

1057
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:04,000
Speaker 2:  This is the longest hour

1058
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,720
Speaker 5:  Ever. I guess the the hack you can do is if you're okay with it going

1059
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:11,640
Speaker 5:  off at 10 minutes to the hour, you could turn on step reminders and use

1060
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:11,800
Speaker 5:  that

1061
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,100
Speaker 6:  As a and just not move.

1062
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:16,600
Speaker 5:  And just not move.

1063
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,280
Speaker 2:  Alright. So yeah, I feel like this landed in the right place. I think think

1064
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:23,130
Speaker 2:  it was, I I would've been surprised if we had landed on the Pixel Watch

1065
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:26,600
Speaker 2:  is better at more things but I feel like the Pixel Watch did a good

1066
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:29,950
Speaker 5:  Job. It's a strong showing for a first gen device.

1067
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:33,520
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I gave it a six, which I think some people will be like, that's really

1068
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:37,240
Speaker 5:  harsh but tough nos. But it gives it like room to grow,

1069
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:40,520
Speaker 5:  you know like so I, I'm going to, I'm gonna quote

1070
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:44,280
Speaker 5:  like diminishing returns that Apple Watch has diminishing returns, right?

1071
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:48,040
Speaker 5:  It's gotten so far advanced, so long that like

1072
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:51,840
Speaker 5:  the amount that it can really improve by gets smaller and smaller each year.

1073
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:55,720
Speaker 5:  The Pixel watch, the Pixel watch two could be a vast improvement over the

1074
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:59,360
Speaker 5:  Pixel Watch one, the Pixel Watch three could be like exponentially better

1075
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:03,240
Speaker 5:  as well. So like there's greater potential coming from

1076
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:06,520
Speaker 5:  these from the Pixel watch than from I would say the Samsung watch or the

1077
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:09,800
Speaker 5:  Apple Watch. But that's just because it's brand new. Yeah,

1078
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:12,050
Speaker 2:  As long as Google doesn't kill it, it might be great Someday.

1079
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:13,480
Speaker 5:  Someday.

1080
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:16,920
Speaker 2:  Yeah. All right, well we need to take a break but thank you both. This was,

1081
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,800
Speaker 2:  this was super helpful and I'm sure we will be back to do this again every

1082
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,330
Speaker 2:  year for the rest of our lives.

1083
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:27,470
Speaker 5:  Si

1084
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:30,520
Speaker 2:  Okay, we need to take another break and then we're gonna come back and do

1085
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:34,080
Speaker 2:  some rapid fire answers on the Vercast hotline. Oh and Victoria actually

1086
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:37,120
Speaker 2:  stay on because we have a question we need you to answer first. We'll be

1087
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:37,240
Speaker 2:  right

1088
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:45,980
Speaker 2:  back.

1089
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:49,910
Speaker 8:  Look, robots do a lot of great things. They serve as dim sum like

1090
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:53,830
Speaker 8:  super fast. They do a B minus job vacuuming our homes. They

1091
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:57,390
Speaker 8:  even help our parents remember that all of their passwords are well

1092
01:03:57,390 --> 01:04:01,350
Speaker 8:  Password. One thing robots aren't great at though finding your next

1109

Speaker 10:  for advice.

1111
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:09,060
Speaker 11:  How often should I water my

1112

Speaker 2:  Welcome back. It's Vergecast hotline time. I love the Vergecast hotline.

1127
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:06,740
Speaker 2:  We've been doing a lot of themed q and as on the hotline recently,

1128
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:10,480
Speaker 2:  but it's been a while since we got to just answer some of the other questions

1129
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,880
Speaker 2:  that we're getting, including a few that we get a lot. Please keep calling

1130
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,880
Speaker 2:  the hotline by the way, I love these questions. Eight sixty six Verge one

1131
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:20,390
Speaker 2:  one call it nass. Anything on your mind, let's take some time and answer

1132
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:23,200
Speaker 2:  a few of them. Now the first question we got comes from

1133
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,500
Speaker 2:  Josh.

1134
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:28,310
Speaker 13:  Hey, my name's Josh and I have a Fitbit Sense

1135
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:32,160
Speaker 13:  with the sense to and the pixel watch coming out. Which one should

1136
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:35,400
Speaker 13:  I get? It seems like Google is very much trying to

1137
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,300
Speaker 13:  disincentivize me from getting the sense to Thank you.

1138
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:42,180
Speaker 2:  All right, this is a question that v you and I have been talking about

1139
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:46,120
Speaker 2:  for like weeks now. I feel like there's a very easy answer to this question,

1140
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:47,430
Speaker 2:  but I'm curious what you think.

1141
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:51,240
Speaker 5:  Well, ding ding, ding. Josh has hit the nail on the head, very

1142
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:54,720
Speaker 5:  astute. It's gonna boil down to what your preferences are and what your priorities

1143
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:58,540
Speaker 5:  are. If you really wanna lean into all the health and fitness,

1144
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:02,480
Speaker 5:  you could make an argument for the sense too. But if you

1145
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,360
Speaker 5:  care at all about literally anything remotely smart, the

1146
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:09,880
Speaker 5:  Pixel Watch is gonna be better bang for your buck. Like as I mentioned earlier,

1147
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:13,840
Speaker 5:  Google is very confused about what to do with all of these watches that they

1148
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:17,000
Speaker 5:  have now. They've got three technically if you include the Sense Two and

1149
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,240
Speaker 5:  the Versa four, which you know, if you asked me they should have merged that

1150
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:24,080
Speaker 5:  together. So what they did was they nerfed the smarter features

1151
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:28,040
Speaker 5:  on the sense too and then they also nerfed some of the

1152
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:31,920
Speaker 5:  more like advanced health features on the Pixel watch. None

1153
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,880
Speaker 5:  of this makes sense. The sense too is $300 that

1154
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:39,360
Speaker 5:  makes no sense to price it at that when you are nerfing the fact that it

1155
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:42,840
Speaker 5:  cannot have third party apps on there. So if you enjoy Pandora,

1156
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:46,720
Speaker 5:  these are the random Starbucks app that's on there that's gone now you can't

1157
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:50,680
Speaker 5:  have it. Bye bye. Sorry, that's so stupid on the sense you could have

1158
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:54,480
Speaker 5:  a choice between Alexa and Google Assistant. Well sorry for

1159
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,760
Speaker 5:  you on a Google product, you could only have Alexa as your

1160
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,420
Speaker 5:  assistant for the sense too. That makes no sense.

1161
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:05,320
Speaker 5:  Pun intended in this case. So what, What

1162
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:09,120
Speaker 5:  you doing? What you doing there Bud? And also you're gonna get Google Maps

1163
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:13,000
Speaker 5:  and Google Wallet much later down the line. It's not available yet on

1164
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,880
Speaker 5:  the sense too, it's just, I'm enraged. On the other hand, if

1165
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,360
Speaker 5:  you're mostly like okay with having the

1166
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:24,320
Speaker 5:  majority of the health features in a basic sense the Pixel watch is

1167
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:27,880
Speaker 5:  fine, it's only $50 more if you're not getting lte. So

1168
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:31,680
Speaker 5:  it's just like, I really do think you're gonna get a better value for

1169
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:35,600
Speaker 5:  the Pixel Watch. The only reason I would tell you not to is if

1170
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,240
Speaker 5:  you are really into the idea of proactive stress

1171
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:43,040
Speaker 5:  alerts and like stress management journaling and you want those

1172
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:46,000
Speaker 5:  proactive alerts like cuz the sense too will be

1173
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,920
Speaker 5:  like I detect that you're having a bodily response

1174
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,200
Speaker 5:  to something. Would you like to log your mood? So

1175
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:57,120
Speaker 5:  that's like the one thing this watch has and Battery

1176
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:57,650
Speaker 5:  Life.

1177
01:08:57,650 --> 01:09:01,420
Speaker 2:  If you wanna say shut up Fitbit, leave me alone 50 times a day,

1178
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:03,310
Speaker 2:  buy a Fitbit. Otherwise,

1179
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:06,760
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I mean I, it's a very thoughtful feature. I think Fitbit does stress

1180
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:10,240
Speaker 5:  management the best and most holistically again a thing. But

1181
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:13,960
Speaker 5:  overall I reviewed the sense too and I was like we're gonna have to

1182
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:17,550
Speaker 5:  pour one out for Fitbit smart watches guys. Cuz this is like, it's,

1183
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:20,960
Speaker 5:  it's just clear that the next time they're gonna

1184
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,680
Speaker 5:  unnerve all the fitness things they did for the Pixel watch

1185
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:28,560
Speaker 5:  and then it's just not a competition. I really think they have the sense

1186
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:32,520
Speaker 5:  too and the verse four already like 90% done and they're

1187
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:35,550
Speaker 5:  like, well gotta put them out there. Gotta give

1188
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:39,240
Speaker 5:  incentives. This is artificially our fitness watch and this is

1189
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:43,080
Speaker 5:  artificially our smart one but we're going to half ass instead of whole

1190
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:46,040
Speaker 5:  ass one thing. The Ron Swanson way, it's been

1191
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:47,230
Speaker 5:  frustrating.

1192
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:51,080
Speaker 2:  Yeah and it, it does seem very clearly like the future of Fitbit

1193
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:54,920
Speaker 2:  looks a lot more like the Pixel Watch than it does the versa or the

1194
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:58,480
Speaker 2:  sense Yep. That like if you fast forward a few years from now and you were

1195
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:01,500
Speaker 2:  like, do all three of those things even still exist? Like I would bet no,

1196
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:04,680
Speaker 2:  but the Pixel watch still will it's, it's the one that's gonna come out of

1197
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:05,120
Speaker 2:  all of this.

1198
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,880
Speaker 5:  David, you told me one day that like we're one pixel band away from

1199
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:12,840
Speaker 5:  all Fitbits just not existing and I agree with you. Yeah, so I just

1200
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:16,580
Speaker 5:  think it's Google and Fitbit are gonna be the same thing now with

1201
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:20,560
Speaker 5:  one arbitrary data barrier between them because regulators

1202
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:21,880
Speaker 5:  said so like that's it.

1203
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:25,670
Speaker 2:  All right Josh, buy a Pixel watch. That's where we are. Thanks Steve. Yeah.

1204
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:29,140
Speaker 2:  Okay, our next question comes from Austin.

1205
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:32,680
Speaker 14:  Hey this is Austin. As somebody who works in my car, one of the things I

1206
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:36,520
Speaker 14:  think about upgrading is my car stereo. I don't know if you guys have looked

1207
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:40,120
Speaker 14:  at upgraded car stereos, but they're just bad

1208
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:43,920
Speaker 14:  pieces of technology. They, they're clunky and they're

1209
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:47,360
Speaker 14:  outdated and even the ones that touchscreens and CarPlay still, you know,

1210
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,960
Speaker 14:  just not fun to use. So I was wondering if there's any reason why these

1211
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,550
Speaker 14:  just seem like they haven't been improved at all in the last two decades.

1212
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:55,560
Speaker 14:  Thanks.

1213
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:59,480
Speaker 2:  Obviously there is only one person maybe on earth who I would want

1214
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:03,440
Speaker 2:  to answer this question and that is Eli Patel. Hi Eli. What's up? What do

1215
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:03,930
Speaker 2:  you got?

1216
01:11:03,930 --> 01:11:07,200
Speaker 15:  So car stereos were amazing in like the nineties and early two thousands

1217
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:11,040
Speaker 15:  because all cars had the same standardized slot in the

1218
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:14,480
Speaker 15:  dashboard to fit a car stereo. It's called the den slot. Some cars had

1219
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:18,080
Speaker 15:  double den slots, which were too high and you could get really crazy car

1220
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:21,120
Speaker 15:  stereos in there. A lot of GM cars had double den slots. But because there

1221
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:24,900
Speaker 15:  was basically a standard hole in your dashboard

1222
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:28,680
Speaker 15:  and all that you needed from a car stereo was to play audio, not all the

1223
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:32,640
Speaker 15:  other stuff in your car. There was like an arms race in cool car stereo

1224
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:36,280
Speaker 15:  stuff cuz the whole market could address the

1225
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:39,840
Speaker 15:  opportunity of we just need to put a stereo in this

1226
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,520
Speaker 15:  rectangle in your dashboard that's the same size in every car. What's happened

1227
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:47,280
Speaker 15:  since then is car dashboards have gotten crazy and

1228
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:51,160
Speaker 15:  they're all different shapes, sizes, screens and cars have become all

1229
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:54,920
Speaker 15:  different shapes and sizes. So there's no more standardized spot

1230
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:58,840
Speaker 15:  for a car stereo to go in a car. No modern car really

1231
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:02,760
Speaker 15:  has Aden slot anymore. And the big trend is to actually

1232
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:06,080
Speaker 15:  break the screen away from the computing hardware

1233
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,880
Speaker 15:  inside. So for a long time, all the computer stuff

1234
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:13,520
Speaker 15:  behind your car's screen was like right behind the display. And now the

1235
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,920
Speaker 15:  big trend is to tuck all that computer stuff elsewhere and make the

1236
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:20,760
Speaker 15:  displays ever thinner and floating space for aesthetic reasons. So

1237
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:24,600
Speaker 15:  there's no market for car stereos anymore, it's, it's gone away. And as

1238
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:28,480
Speaker 15:  cars get newer and older cars go off the road, the actual market for

1239
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:31,360
Speaker 15:  car stereos is shrinking, which is why you see no innovation, there's not

1240
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:35,160
Speaker 15:  a great return on investment to actually invent

1241
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:39,060
Speaker 15:  a new kind of car stereo. There are infinity,

1242
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:42,880
Speaker 15:  bad Android-based car stereos you can buy. So if you get

1243
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:46,180
Speaker 15:  away from the brand names like the pioneers and the Kenwoods or whatever,

1244
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:49,800
Speaker 15:  and you fall down the rabbit hole of weird

1245
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:53,750
Speaker 15:  Chinese companies in other weird companies like Phoenix Automotive,

1246
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:57,640
Speaker 15:  they will sell you an Android tablet that can take over all of the

1247
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:01,600
Speaker 15:  functions of your car. You could replace the entire center stack of a

1248
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:05,480
Speaker 15:  modern Ford with like an Android tablet. It's just a horrible Android

1249
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:08,680
Speaker 15:  tablet and you don't wanna have that experience. And you can watch the YouTube

1250
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:12,440
Speaker 15:  videos of people who do it and they're so excited and then they're like,

1251
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:16,240
Speaker 15:  wait, this is horrible. And they all end up reverting. I've gone

1252
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:19,280
Speaker 15:  down the full loop of like two in the morning, I'm gonna buy one of these

1253
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:23,180
Speaker 15:  Android tablets and then I go and watch a review and then I don't do it

1254
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:26,980
Speaker 15:  and you can just join me on that journey. But the answer basically is

1255
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:30,880
Speaker 15:  new cars don't have the right size holes in them to

1256
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:34,280
Speaker 15:  fit your car stereo. They all have different size holes now, so there's

1257
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:36,470
Speaker 15:  no more innovation.

1258
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:39,320
Speaker 2:  Okay, next up we have a message from Gary in

1259
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:40,740
Speaker 2:  Canada.

1260
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:44,680
Speaker 16:  Hey, it's Gary from New Brunswick, Canada. I have a daughter who's eventually

1261
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:48,070
Speaker 16:  gonna be asking for her own phone. I assume she'll be asking for an iPhone

1262
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:51,960
Speaker 16:  mainly because children can be awful to each other and we know if they get

1263
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:55,530
Speaker 16:  something different from the rest of them, they treat each other poorly.

1264
01:13:55,530 --> 01:13:59,280
Speaker 16:  So I assume she'll be one of the sheep and want to get her own iPhone. Our

1265
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:02,720
Speaker 16:  household unfortunately is all Google except for a MacBook Pro. So I would

1266
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:05,920
Speaker 16:  be inclined to just give her an Android phone and be done with it. So my

1267
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:09,640
Speaker 16:  question is, how does one, do parental controls properly on an iPhone when

1268
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:13,340
Speaker 16:  you don't own another iOS device? Can it be done on the single iPhone?

1269
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:16,920
Speaker 16:  Can you manage it with a MacBook Pro? It seems kind of ridiculous that I

1270
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:20,700
Speaker 16:  would've to go buy a cheap iPad or something just to manage it for her.

1271
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:24,680
Speaker 16:  And are there any gaps in features, in functionality with any of

1272
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:28,320
Speaker 16:  the options that you could do to manage that? So thanks, love the

1273
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:29,110
Speaker 16:  podcast.

1274
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:33,060
Speaker 2:  This turned out to be a surprisingly interesting and complicated question

1275
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:37,000
Speaker 2:  and the short version of a longer answer is that Apple actually doesn't handle

1276
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,840
Speaker 2:  this very well. But Liam, our producer, did a bunch of looking and

1277
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:44,560
Speaker 2:  researching and found that actually the best way to do this for you,

1278
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:48,480
Speaker 2:  Gary, is gonna be on the device itself. In the screen time settings, you

1279
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:51,760
Speaker 2:  can set up what's called a screen time passcode and basically you would have

1280
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:55,720
Speaker 2:  that passcode but not your kid. And then through that passcode, that's

1281
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:58,720
Speaker 2:  how you'd be able to manage things like content and privacy restrictions

1282
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:02,550
Speaker 2:  and which of the built in apps they're allowed to use. And you can turn off

1283
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:05,920
Speaker 2:  allowing iTunes and app store purchases, all the kind of stuff you would

1284
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:09,680
Speaker 2:  want to do for parental controls, all lives in screen time on the

1285
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:13,080
Speaker 2:  device itself. And if you wanna manage it again, you would need that screen

1286
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:16,760
Speaker 2:  time passcode that does require you to have an Apple id, which could be

1287
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:20,290
Speaker 2:  slightly annoying, but it gives you much more control over what's going on

1288
01:15:20,290 --> 01:15:24,200
Speaker 2:  on the kid's device. I would argue this is like a terrible system and should

1289
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,720
Speaker 2:  be much easier to manage. But here's where we are. So you're gonna wanna

1290
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:30,240
Speaker 2:  get a screen time passcode in the screen time settings on the iPhone, keep

1291
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:33,800
Speaker 2:  that passcode for you and don't give it to your kid. It does mean that anytime

1292
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,280
Speaker 2:  you wanna manage this stuff, you're gonna actually have to have the device

1293
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:40,120
Speaker 2:  itself, which you know, could be testy, whether you conceal your

1294
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:43,160
Speaker 2:  kid's phone away from them in order to change some of this stuff. But that's

1295
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:45,680
Speaker 2:  where it is. So all this stuff lives in screen time and the way you'd manage

1296
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:48,720
Speaker 2:  it for yourself basically is also the way you'll manage it for your kid.

1297
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:52,400
Speaker 2:  You'll just have a separate passcode. It's messy, but it seems to

1298
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:56,240
Speaker 2:  work. Finally, to close out the show, we have an age

1299
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:59,930
Speaker 2:  old question about podcast apps. I love talking about podcast apps,

1300
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:01,540
Speaker 2:  so let's hear it.

1301
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:05,390
Speaker 17:  Hey Vergecast, this is Summer Zika. I'm calling looking for

1302
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:09,300
Speaker 17:  a good podcast app alternative. I have an iPhone

1303
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:13,280
Speaker 17:  and I'm really sick and tired of my podcast app, the

1304
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:17,100
Speaker 17:  Apple Podcast app not syncing up every time Apple releases a new

1305
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:20,880
Speaker 17:  iOS update. What's a good podcast app I can use that's not

1306
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:24,190
Speaker 17:  Spotify and doesn't require a subscription? Thanks.

1307
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:28,080
Speaker 2:  This question prompted a surprising amount of controversy

1308
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:31,240
Speaker 2:  among our little vergecast team over here, so we're just gonna talk about

1309
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:33,330
Speaker 2:  it here. Andrew Marino. Hello?

1310
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:33,680
Speaker 18:  Hi,

1311
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:35,500
Speaker 2:  David, Liam, James. Hello.

1312
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:36,230
Speaker 18:  Hey.

1313
01:16:36,230 --> 01:16:40,040
Speaker 2:  Okay, so based on my read of the situation, Liam, you're

1314
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:43,600
Speaker 2:  wrong. So why don't you go first and tell us your bad answer before we tell

1315
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,950
Speaker 2:  everybody The good answer,

1316
01:16:44,950 --> 01:16:48,520
Speaker 18:  I wouldn't say it's a bad answer, but it is definitely a

1317
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:52,400
Speaker 18:  niche app. It's called Castro for iOS. I don't think they have an

1318
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:55,590
Speaker 18:  Android app. It's for people like me who

1319
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:59,350
Speaker 18:  have tabs on a ton, like over a hundred

1320
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:03,240
Speaker 18:  podcasts, but don't actually listen to them all. So the thing that makes

1321
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:06,960
Speaker 18:  it unique is it's got two buckets. One is the queue,

1322
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,960
Speaker 18:  your actual play queue. These are podcasts that that you're always gonna

1323
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:13,930
Speaker 18:  listen to. And the other, and for me, much larger bucket

1324
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:17,800
Speaker 18:  is just podcasts you're keeping tabs on. And so I'll scroll

1325
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,840
Speaker 18:  through that list maybe once a week and pick the ones I actually wanna listen

1326
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:24,360
Speaker 18:  to and just wipe all the rest of them. But the whole app is centered around

1327
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:27,640
Speaker 18:  that. So if that's not the way you listen to podcasts, you'll probably hate

1328
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:31,560
Speaker 18:  this app. But I think it is the best one out there. And

1329
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:32,390
Speaker 18:  I'm not wrong.

1330
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:35,840
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I give Castro a hard time, but it does for that one specific thing

1331
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:38,400
Speaker 2:  where it's like, I have a bunch of podcasts but I don't wanna listen to all

1332
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:42,320
Speaker 2:  the episodes. I just wanna make myself a queue. Castro's really, really

1333
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:42,940
Speaker 2:  good at that.

1334
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:46,520
Speaker 18:  And I should say, you know, you can basically create that same

1335
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:50,440
Speaker 18:  functionality in other podcast apps, but this is

1336
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:54,320
Speaker 18:  just kind of like an automated, you know, it's like the framework of the

1337
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:58,280
Speaker 18:  app itself. So maybe it's not as important to you. I'm sure you can

1338
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:00,710
Speaker 18:  create this with playlists or something else in another app.

1339
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:04,480
Speaker 2:  Fair enough. It's a, it's a good app but it's not the best app. Andrew, you're

1340
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:07,160
Speaker 2:  correct about the best app, but just to say that you agree with me about

1341
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:09,160
Speaker 2:  what the best app is, tell us what you

1342
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:12,920
Speaker 19:  Think. Yeah, so I use PocketCasts and I started using it

1343
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:16,460
Speaker 19:  because a while back I was using an iPhone

1344
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:20,200
Speaker 19:  and an Android tablet to listen to podcasts. And

1345
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:23,930
Speaker 19:  this was an app that I could sync what podcasts I were listening to

1346
01:18:23,930 --> 01:18:27,600
Speaker 19:  on two different devices. So I had been using PocketCasts and

1347
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,470
Speaker 19:  also when we put timestamps into the show,

1348
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:35,260
Speaker 19:  pocket casts, when you're listening to the show, you can actually

1349
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:39,080
Speaker 19:  use the timestamps as a hyperlink, which brings you right

1350
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:43,000
Speaker 19:  to that point in the show. And a lot of podcast apps don't offer

1351
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:43,690
Speaker 19:  this.

1352
01:18:43,690 --> 01:18:46,390
Speaker 18:  Is that like chapters Andrew?

1353
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:50,280
Speaker 19:  It's like chapters. We get a lot of emails, we

1354
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:54,120
Speaker 19:  get at least one email a week about chapters in the Verge Cast. Where are

1355
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:57,700
Speaker 19:  the chapters? Why won't you support chapters? Everyone does this megaphone.

1356
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:01,600
Speaker 19:  Our publishing platform does not support chapters, so we're not

1357
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:05,280
Speaker 19:  able to do it right now, but we really want to, we're all on board for

1358
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,090
Speaker 19:  chapters, but we can't do it yet.

1359
01:19:07,090 --> 01:19:11,000
Speaker 2:  We get a lot of emails wondering where chapters are and we also send a lot

1360
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,880
Speaker 2:  of emails to different people also wondering where chapters are. So if you

1361
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,640
Speaker 2:  want us to have chapters, don't worry. We want it just as badly as you do,

1362
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:20,760
Speaker 2:  right? You're right about PocketCasts and you're also right about the reason

1363
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:24,440
Speaker 2:  for PocketCasts because PocketCasts is everywhere, which is why I think it's

1364
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:27,360
Speaker 2:  great. They have a web app that's very good. There's an Android app that's

1365
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:30,720
Speaker 2:  very good. They're desktop apps that are very good. It is like the

1366
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:34,480
Speaker 2:  most functional cross platform podcast app. It also

1367
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:38,240
Speaker 2:  has a million ways to do stuff. You can filter it, like I have a filter for

1368
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:41,880
Speaker 2:  just like the daily podcast that come out every day and those just dump into

1369
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:44,760
Speaker 2:  one place. I have stuff for like my favorites that I know I'm gonna listen

1370
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:48,420
Speaker 2:  to. So if you wanna like sort the hell outta your podcasts, you totally can.

1371
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:52,400
Speaker 2:  But mostly it's easy and everywhere. And

1372
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:56,160
Speaker 2:  that's good enough for me. For podcast apps, I should say the, the two honorable

1373
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:59,960
Speaker 2:  mentions we should mention are Spotify, which has lots of podcasts

1374
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:03,510
Speaker 2:  and is just a god awful podcast app. Like do not,

1375
01:20:03,510 --> 01:20:07,040
Speaker 2:  unless you hate yourself, use Spotify as your podcast player because it,

1376
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:10,870
Speaker 2:  it is awful. And the other one is Overcast, which I think falls into

1377
01:20:10,870 --> 01:20:14,800
Speaker 2:  Liam's category of like apps that do less but do it very

1378
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,960
Speaker 2:  well. Overcast is really good for like, if you're the type to listen to it

1379
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:21,840
Speaker 2:  fast and you wanna compress silence so you can hear stuff better and get

1380
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:25,240
Speaker 2:  through shows more quickly. It's really good for managing stuff. It's

1381
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:29,160
Speaker 2:  only basically for Mac and iOS users, but it's a really good

1382
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:32,400
Speaker 2:  podcast to have. But for me it's pocket casts and I think it's not particularly

1383
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:32,780
Speaker 2:  close.

1384
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:36,580
Speaker 18:  You know, that begs the question that I really want the answer to Andrew,

1385
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:40,120
Speaker 18:  the man who makes our podcast sound as good as it does. What do you think

1386
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:43,960
Speaker 18:  of these trim silence features? I'm, I'm really curious. There's,

1387
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:47,880
Speaker 18:  you know, a lot of people love and hate listening at 1.5

1388
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:51,840
Speaker 18:  x. I'm very much on the side of listen to it the way it was meant to

1389
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,480
Speaker 18:  be listened to, which is one X, But what about trim

1390
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:55,840
Speaker 18:  silence?

1391
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:59,520
Speaker 19:  There's some shows that need the trim silence feature and I think that's

1392
01:20:59,520 --> 01:20:59,940
Speaker 19:  okay,

1393
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:00,960
Speaker 2:  But not the Verge

1394
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:04,640
Speaker 19:  Cast, but not the Verge cast. I spend a lot of time cutting

1395
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:08,320
Speaker 19:  silence on my end, so I don't think you need it. And if you do

1396
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:12,080
Speaker 19:  need it then I think you might as well just be using the like

1397
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,070
Speaker 19:  two times speed.

1398
01:21:13,070 --> 01:21:16,640
Speaker 2:  That's fair. All right, listen to podcast Casts unless you

1399
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:20,120
Speaker 2:  think Liam is right, which he's not. And Castro is also a good app.

1400
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:22,240
Speaker 18:  It's a great app. Support your podcast app

1401
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:24,830
Speaker 18:  developer.

1402
01:21:24,830 --> 01:21:28,490
Speaker 2:  Okay. And with that, that is the vergecast for this week. Thank you for listening.
