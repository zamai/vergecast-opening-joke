Description: Would you like Siri more if it had a face? This week on The Vergecast, we’re talking about AI assistants getting smarter… and uncomfortably personal. The Verge’s Jennifer Pattison Tuohy joins the show to talk about her early tests of Alexa Plus, which is finally AI-powered and a lot more capable. Jake shares his uncomfortable first interaction with Grok’s anime girlfriend. And Waveform cohost David Imel is here to talk about Sony’s RX1R III and other premium “compact” cameras. 

Finally, the THUNDER ROUND is back. New, improved, and still loud.




2
00:01:55,765 --> 00:01:59,595
Speaker 5:  Hello and Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of deeply Uncomfortable

3
00:01:59,595 --> 00:02:03,355
Speaker 5:  Conversations with ai. I'm Jay Kakis, executive editor of The Verge,

4
00:02:03,585 --> 00:02:07,195
Speaker 5:  NELI Patel, David Pierce. They're on parental Leave. They'll both be

5
00:02:07,285 --> 00:02:10,755
Speaker 5:  back later this year. Today we've got a fantastic

6
00:02:10,985 --> 00:02:14,835
Speaker 5:  crew joining us remotely. We've got VERGE Smart Home reviewer, Jen Tuey.

7
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:16,515
Speaker 1:  Hello, nice to be here.

8
00:02:17,115 --> 00:02:20,795
Speaker 5:  Anne in the studio with us. Special guest friend of the show and waveform

9
00:02:20,795 --> 00:02:24,555
Speaker 5:  co-host David Am Mill. Hello, glad to be here. We've got a lot to talk about

10
00:02:24,555 --> 00:02:27,675
Speaker 5:  today. David's joining 'cause I really wanna talk about Sony's new camera,

11
00:02:27,675 --> 00:02:31,555
Speaker 5:  which people have been waiting 10 years for the THUNDER ROUND is back

12
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:35,635
Speaker 5:  new and improved. Just wait for it. But first we

13
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:39,155
Speaker 5:  have to talk about AI assistance because two big things happened this week.

14
00:02:39,605 --> 00:02:43,515
Speaker 5:  First, Jen got access to Alexa, plus the new AI powered version

15
00:02:43,535 --> 00:02:47,315
Speaker 5:  of Alexa and Second Crock got weird

16
00:02:47,315 --> 00:02:51,115
Speaker 5:  again. It's always getting weird. It keeps going And

17
00:02:51,275 --> 00:02:55,035
Speaker 5:  I actually think these two things are kind of related in the long term.

18
00:02:55,535 --> 00:02:58,955
Speaker 5:  So first, Jen, you've been talking to Alexa a bunch lately. Tell us

19
00:02:59,435 --> 00:03:01,525
Speaker 5:  what have you seen what is new with Alexa Plus?

20
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:06,005
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so I've been waiting a long time to chat to this ai. I am not gonna

21
00:03:06,005 --> 00:03:09,845
Speaker 6:  lie, this is Amazon's newly revamped

22
00:03:09,895 --> 00:03:13,725
Speaker 6:  generative AI powered voice assistant. Now for context, I've had,

23
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:18,405
Speaker 6:  I'm, I'm gonna try not to say the A-L-E-X-A word too many times 'cause I

24
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:21,845
Speaker 6:  know that might annoy all the listeners out there. But I've had Amazon's

25
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:24,965
Speaker 6:  a in my home pretty much since it launched

26
00:03:26,265 --> 00:03:30,085
Speaker 6:  and this, and it's, it's been an experience over the years. It was

27
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:33,485
Speaker 6:  great when it first launched, but it's kind of started to get less and less

28
00:03:33,585 --> 00:03:36,965
Speaker 6:  useful as time went by. And Amazon has completely

29
00:03:37,245 --> 00:03:40,965
Speaker 6:  revamped the, the assistant. So now it's

30
00:03:40,965 --> 00:03:44,925
Speaker 6:  powered by large language models. This they launched or announced it fully

31
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:49,725
Speaker 6:  February of this year. Although they had originally launched it in 2023

32
00:03:49,945 --> 00:03:53,885
Speaker 6:  and then spent a really long time bringing it to the public. They

33
00:03:53,885 --> 00:03:56,645
Speaker 6:  said it was gonna come out in March. It's now July.

34
00:03:57,665 --> 00:04:01,405
Speaker 6:  So it's slowly rolling out to people. You have to request early

35
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:04,405
Speaker 6:  access. So it's still technically in a beta stage.

36
00:04:05,315 --> 00:04:09,245
Speaker 6:  It's free to use currently, but the plan according to Amazon is

37
00:04:09,245 --> 00:04:13,085
Speaker 6:  it's going to be 1999 a month. However you get

38
00:04:13,245 --> 00:04:16,405
Speaker 6:  it free with Prime. So when prime costs

39
00:04:16,885 --> 00:04:20,805
Speaker 6:  $15 a month, it's, yeah, the math is a bit screw screwy

40
00:04:20,805 --> 00:04:24,405
Speaker 6:  there. But it's interesting to see this approach. I mean obviously

41
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:28,325
Speaker 6:  currently you pay for more advanced features with a lot of different AI

42
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,965
Speaker 6:  assistance out there. So you can kind of see their approach here.

43
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:36,805
Speaker 6:  But it's also a big shift for people who have been able to use

44
00:04:36,855 --> 00:04:40,725
Speaker 6:  Alexa, sorry, who've been able to use a for free

45
00:04:41,065 --> 00:04:44,925
Speaker 6:  for over a decade. So it's, it's, I was excited to

46
00:04:44,945 --> 00:04:48,565
Speaker 6:  try out the new capabilities, see if they're worth any extra money, even

47
00:04:48,565 --> 00:04:52,485
Speaker 6:  though you don't have to pay that yet. The big thing they're pushing is that

48
00:04:52,485 --> 00:04:56,445
Speaker 6:  it is more age agentic like this, this assistant can

49
00:04:56,465 --> 00:05:00,205
Speaker 6:  do things for you from what it could already do,

50
00:05:00,235 --> 00:05:03,445
Speaker 6:  such as controlling your smart home devices and playing your music, but being

51
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:07,165
Speaker 6:  able to do it in a natural language way so you don't have to use that precise

52
00:05:07,405 --> 00:05:10,605
Speaker 6:  nomenclature. If anyone that's used a before

53
00:05:11,155 --> 00:05:15,125
Speaker 6:  will know you have to get it very, very precise to get it to do

54
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:18,085
Speaker 6:  what you want. And it's very frustrating when it misunderstands you and does

55
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:21,805
Speaker 6:  something that it shouldn't. So that's the big, that's one of the big shifts.

56
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:25,525
Speaker 6:  And then the other is that it's actually going to be able to sort of do

57
00:05:25,745 --> 00:05:29,685
Speaker 6:  things like book you, well this is where it gets a bit fuzzy 'cause it

58
00:05:29,685 --> 00:05:32,285
Speaker 6:  used to be able to book you an Uber and then they stopped being able to do

59
00:05:32,285 --> 00:05:35,805
Speaker 6:  that, but now they're bringing it back. And so it's more these age agentic

60
00:05:35,805 --> 00:05:39,205
Speaker 6:  sort of clicking around on the websites feature as Neli would put it, where

61
00:05:39,955 --> 00:05:43,525
Speaker 6:  your, your a assistant is gonna be able to go and book you an Uber,

62
00:05:44,015 --> 00:05:47,965
Speaker 6:  going to be able to book you a plumber or an electrician, book you

63
00:05:47,965 --> 00:05:51,925
Speaker 6:  an open table restaurant reservation, do things for you

64
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:56,245
Speaker 6:  outside of what traditionally had been able to do, again

65
00:05:56,245 --> 00:06:00,005
Speaker 6:  in natural language. And then the other element of it, which is,

66
00:06:00,145 --> 00:06:04,005
Speaker 6:  is kind of more of a, you were already

67
00:06:04,005 --> 00:06:07,845
Speaker 6:  able to do some of this, but it's got better, is be much

68
00:06:07,845 --> 00:06:11,125
Speaker 6:  more conversational. So you can ask the assistant

69
00:06:12,045 --> 00:06:16,005
Speaker 6:  questions like you maybe would ask chat GPT or Gemini. And rather than just

70
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:19,605
Speaker 6:  getting sort of very basic responses, it's got much deeper

71
00:06:19,605 --> 00:06:23,205
Speaker 6:  knowledge and is much more able to respond to more general

72
00:06:23,205 --> 00:06:27,125
Speaker 6:  knowledge questions. So in my testing when I, I, I wrote a piece that we

73
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:30,885
Speaker 6:  published last week. I spent like my first 24 hours, so I was chatting with

74
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:34,765
Speaker 6:  it about the Wimbledon tennis tournament, which is one of my favorite

75
00:06:34,815 --> 00:06:38,205
Speaker 6:  times of the year. I was also asking it questions about

76
00:06:38,395 --> 00:06:42,325
Speaker 6:  booking my next vacation. I'm about to go on a trip

77
00:06:42,385 --> 00:06:46,205
Speaker 6:  And I was asking for suggestions and it told me some great tips

78
00:06:46,225 --> 00:06:49,805
Speaker 6:  and ideas and then completely lied to me. So it's just like your general

79
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:50,685
Speaker 6:  AI basically,

80
00:06:52,105 --> 00:06:56,085
Speaker 5:  Jen, I love that you're avoiding the name. This is the sign of a true professional

81
00:06:56,185 --> 00:06:59,885
Speaker 5:  who has been, I I I'm also assuming yelled at a lot a lot by

82
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:03,365
Speaker 5:  people in in comments. Yeah, I'm, I'm sorry to everyone.

83
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:07,085
Speaker 5:  Okay. But this is, this is the big thing, right? Like they announced this,

84
00:07:07,085 --> 00:07:10,605
Speaker 5:  they now this like twice now. Yeah, yeah. They, they launched it

85
00:07:11,115 --> 00:07:15,045
Speaker 5:  like in, what is it, in March quote launched. Yes, yes. Right, right, right.

86
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:19,085
Speaker 5:  Yes. I believe there, there now more than a

87
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:21,765
Speaker 5:  million people now have access to it, which sounds like a lot until you,

88
00:07:21,835 --> 00:07:25,445
Speaker 5:  they've sold 500 million Alexa devices. Yeah. So this is

89
00:07:25,835 --> 00:07:29,685
Speaker 5:  like, like not even quite a beta test. Like this is the teeny tiny

90
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,645
Speaker 5:  group. And I guess the re I, I have been wondering okay, like what are they

91
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:38,205
Speaker 5:  hiding? Like why is it so limited? Yeah. And Jen, I

92
00:07:38,205 --> 00:07:41,605
Speaker 5:  don't know, like I read your piece and it sounds like it's like it's, it's

93
00:07:41,605 --> 00:07:44,405
Speaker 5:  mostly functional. Like are are you running, how is it working? Are you running

94
00:07:44,405 --> 00:07:45,725
Speaker 5:  into problems nonstop?

95
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:49,925
Speaker 6:  So now, I mean it is functional, but what's really

96
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:53,845
Speaker 6:  interesting here is it's a completely new assistant. I think originally when

97
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:57,805
Speaker 6:  they went to launch it in 2023 and we went to a big event

98
00:07:57,865 --> 00:08:01,245
Speaker 6:  in 2023 for the launch, it was going to be the

99
00:08:02,085 --> 00:08:05,835
Speaker 6:  existing commander control style AI that elect

100
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:09,515
Speaker 6:  Alexa was, I'm sorry everyone. It was gonna be that

101
00:08:09,945 --> 00:08:13,715
Speaker 6:  with an infusion of, you know, chat GPT large

102
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:17,115
Speaker 6:  language model style smarts. Because one of the com

103
00:08:17,545 --> 00:08:21,435
Speaker 6:  confounding things about using the assistant over the years is its limited

104
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:25,595
Speaker 6:  capabilities. It is very much com commander control. It can do

105
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:29,475
Speaker 6:  specific things and that's it. And that was getting frustrating over time.

106
00:08:29,615 --> 00:08:33,395
Speaker 6:  It never really got any smarter. And that was sort of what

107
00:08:33,395 --> 00:08:36,955
Speaker 6:  people, I think most people that use it for smart home control,

108
00:08:37,795 --> 00:08:41,275
Speaker 6:  I think that was fine. But as things as we're starting to see better

109
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:45,195
Speaker 6:  capabilities throughout generative AI and more

110
00:08:45,535 --> 00:08:49,475
Speaker 6:  and better abilities, being able to use your voice

111
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:53,515
Speaker 6:  for more than just turning your lights on and off, setting a timer that,

112
00:08:53,615 --> 00:08:57,565
Speaker 6:  you know, that felt like the next step that yeah, that move towards,

113
00:08:57,585 --> 00:09:01,325
Speaker 6:  you know, what Alexa was originally envisioned as as, which is

114
00:09:01,395 --> 00:09:04,405
Speaker 6:  Star Trek's computer. You know, that all knowing all

115
00:09:05,835 --> 00:09:09,765
Speaker 6:  omnipresent AI that can do whatever you want. And that

116
00:09:09,765 --> 00:09:12,325
Speaker 6:  was kind of where I was, I was excited to see

117
00:09:13,425 --> 00:09:17,325
Speaker 6:  Amazon move this and that was what they promised in 2000. And

118
00:09:17,325 --> 00:09:21,245
Speaker 6:  in 2023 then we're not entirely sure kind of what

119
00:09:21,245 --> 00:09:24,805
Speaker 6:  went on behind the scenes, but there was an awful lot of reporting about

120
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:29,045
Speaker 6:  real struggles. And this is struggles that we have seen of it's

121
00:09:29,075 --> 00:09:32,805
Speaker 6:  appears places like Apple and Google are also having, trying to get

122
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:36,485
Speaker 6:  this to happen with their assistance because they were built on one type

123
00:09:36,485 --> 00:09:40,325
Speaker 6:  of infrastructure and they're now trying to add this new large

124
00:09:40,645 --> 00:09:44,565
Speaker 6:  language model capability and they're just not meshing. There's not, and

125
00:09:44,565 --> 00:09:48,165
Speaker 6:  so when I spoke to Panos pane at the last, the second

126
00:09:48,225 --> 00:09:51,605
Speaker 6:  launch, the second coming of Alexa Plus,

127
00:09:52,855 --> 00:09:56,245
Speaker 6:  which I'm not sure if I mentioned that's its name, sorry. But you still use

128
00:09:56,245 --> 00:10:00,165
Speaker 6:  the original word, you still use the A word. But Alexa, when,

129
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:03,965
Speaker 6:  when they announced, when, when they announced it in February, I spoke to

130
00:10:04,055 --> 00:10:07,685
Speaker 6:  Panas Panay and he said, no, this is completely new. We just, we got rid

131
00:10:07,685 --> 00:10:11,125
Speaker 6:  of the old brought in the new 'cause that was, it seems the only way that

132
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,885
Speaker 6:  they were able to completely reimagine,

133
00:10:14,605 --> 00:10:18,565
Speaker 6:  couldn't keep the old. And I think that is the key to the slow rollout

134
00:10:18,565 --> 00:10:22,485
Speaker 6:  because as you say, there are millions of devices out there that

135
00:10:22,485 --> 00:10:25,965
Speaker 6:  people are using for many different purposes and use cases

136
00:10:27,065 --> 00:10:31,005
Speaker 6:  mostly to set a timer. Yes. But there

137
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,965
Speaker 6:  are a lot of people that use this and depend on it. And I think also the

138
00:10:34,965 --> 00:10:38,765
Speaker 6:  accessibility community, you know, voice control is a really important feature

139
00:10:38,825 --> 00:10:42,525
Speaker 6:  for a lot of people. So I think the, the so rollout has been not breaking

140
00:10:42,595 --> 00:10:46,485
Speaker 6:  what already works and adding the new

141
00:10:46,485 --> 00:10:49,645
Speaker 6:  capabilities. And in my testing I did notice

142
00:10:50,355 --> 00:10:54,205
Speaker 6:  that it had broken some of what already worked. And that is,

143
00:10:54,205 --> 00:10:57,925
Speaker 6:  you know, you can see how that's gonna be a problem as this, as they flip

144
00:10:57,925 --> 00:11:01,805
Speaker 6:  the switch and bring this into multiple, multiple millions of homes. So,

145
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:06,485
Speaker 6:  but for me it was mainly around that smart home control. So if

146
00:11:06,485 --> 00:11:10,285
Speaker 6:  you're familiar with using a, every time I say it, you

147
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:10,485
Speaker 6:  laugh

148
00:11:12,265 --> 00:11:12,485
Speaker 6:  And

149
00:11:12,485 --> 00:11:15,765
Speaker 5:  I do, I do think this is so interesting, right, because it, like

150
00:11:16,785 --> 00:11:20,495
Speaker 5:  Apple has not done this with Apple intelligence on the home pod. No. Google

151
00:11:20,835 --> 00:11:24,695
Speaker 5:  has a very, very limited beta. Yeah, I've been trying to get into it.

152
00:11:25,295 --> 00:11:28,895
Speaker 5:  A Google Home one. Yeah. And can't get, you know, it, it's,

153
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:33,095
Speaker 5:  it's also not rolling out. Are you, are you an Alexa guy? I'm on mix,

154
00:11:33,435 --> 00:11:37,055
Speaker 5:  mix of Google Home and Home Kit now. That's terrifying. Well, the reason

155
00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:41,335
Speaker 5:  why, yeah. Yeah. The reason I, the only reason I'm on Home Kit

156
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:45,215
Speaker 5:  is because the smart plugs that I bought were the first ones that

157
00:11:45,215 --> 00:11:48,775
Speaker 5:  supported Matter. But they were, well, they were going to support Matter.

158
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:51,935
Speaker 5:  They were gonna have an up, they did have an update. It doesn't work for

159
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,925
Speaker 5:  me, but they, they are home kit native. So that is the reason

160
00:11:55,925 --> 00:11:59,725
Speaker 5:  that I have home kit native stuff, but I also have like

161
00:11:59,725 --> 00:12:03,685
Speaker 5:  Google Nest hubs in my apartment. Okay. The, the, the magical idea

162
00:12:03,785 --> 00:12:07,765
Speaker 5:  was that one day when Matter actually like works for everybody, they will

163
00:12:07,765 --> 00:12:11,605
Speaker 5:  all integrate and it won't matter what will matter, but yes,

164
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:16,245
Speaker 5:  that's your answer. Yes. This answer for you. So, so you are also,

165
00:12:16,345 --> 00:12:20,005
Speaker 5:  yes, I mean this is the thing. It's like, especially when we have these

166
00:12:20,235 --> 00:12:24,045
Speaker 5:  complex like multi-system networks, the idea of, of an

167
00:12:24,225 --> 00:12:27,485
Speaker 5:  AI thing that can actually like string stuff together and understand, I mean,

168
00:12:27,485 --> 00:12:30,725
Speaker 5:  Jen, you have this in your piece where you're giving it these complicated

169
00:12:30,765 --> 00:12:34,605
Speaker 5:  commands and telling it to figure out how to build a routine for you.

170
00:12:34,945 --> 00:12:38,765
Speaker 5:  And it's like, that's great. Yeah. Right. Like, I hate filling with these

171
00:12:38,765 --> 00:12:42,605
Speaker 5:  things. So I, I have like a big, my home is, I guess it's mixed with,

172
00:12:42,605 --> 00:12:46,245
Speaker 5:  it's like Phillips Hu and that's all built into got what is, what is it Google

173
00:12:46,245 --> 00:12:49,325
Speaker 5:  Home? Yeah. I've got a whole bunch of other things to hook into Google Home,

174
00:12:49,325 --> 00:12:52,165
Speaker 5:  is that what it's called now? But it, it might be called Google Home. I,

175
00:12:52,245 --> 00:12:55,845
Speaker 5:  I think it's Google Home. And like I, half of them just like

176
00:12:55,985 --> 00:12:59,685
Speaker 5:  didn't work for a couple years And I had to like un remove them and re

177
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:03,445
Speaker 5:  it's like eventually it all hooks together on some level

178
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:08,365
Speaker 5:  and they're just like, it is not easy enough to string them together

179
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:12,285
Speaker 5:  right now. And I, I imagine that like, there's a

180
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:16,525
Speaker 5:  a million different issues for Amazon to untangle

181
00:13:16,665 --> 00:13:20,525
Speaker 5:  as they're rolling out Alexa plus the first one and most, most immediate

182
00:13:20,545 --> 00:13:24,005
Speaker 5:  one is just being like, if you're gonna put an LLM in

183
00:13:24,075 --> 00:13:28,005
Speaker 5:  500 million, you know, devices, you gotta make sure

184
00:13:28,005 --> 00:13:31,645
Speaker 5:  it's not gonna go off the rails. Unlike other companies

185
00:13:31,655 --> 00:13:32,605
Speaker 5:  which just don't care.

186
00:13:33,435 --> 00:13:36,445
Speaker 6:  Well, and there's something very different about having, And I mentioned

187
00:13:36,445 --> 00:13:39,765
Speaker 6:  this in my piece, having a voice in your home telling you something confidently

188
00:13:40,345 --> 00:13:44,245
Speaker 6:  that's not true versus having a text box, right. A

189
00:13:44,565 --> 00:13:47,725
Speaker 6:  sentence to you that you can then quickly Google or click on the link that

190
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:51,725
Speaker 6:  it, it produces so that you can go and confirm where it got that information.

191
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:55,765
Speaker 6:  So is that, is that computer, it's that Star Trek computer idea again, that

192
00:13:55,815 --> 00:13:59,645
Speaker 6:  omniscient being in your home? That is, you know, that's where

193
00:13:59,645 --> 00:14:03,415
Speaker 6:  that fine line is. And it is so much, I mean,

194
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:07,855
Speaker 6:  the new Alexa plus is definitely better than the old one

195
00:14:08,235 --> 00:14:11,495
Speaker 6:  in terms of being able to talk to it however you like,

196
00:14:11,925 --> 00:14:15,575
Speaker 6:  getting a response whether it can actually answer correctly or not. But it

197
00:14:15,575 --> 00:14:19,055
Speaker 6:  will talk to you and it'll explain to you why it can't answer or if it can

198
00:14:19,055 --> 00:14:22,775
Speaker 6:  answer. But in terms of that command and control

199
00:14:23,015 --> 00:14:26,695
Speaker 6:  structure, I ran into a, a number of issues. Like it can't run

200
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:30,275
Speaker 6:  routines in the way that the current Amazon assistant can.

201
00:14:30,895 --> 00:14:34,875
Speaker 6:  It can't. So I think that's, there's gonna be friction there. But what what's

202
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:38,715
Speaker 6:  interesting I think is where we can see Amazon's taking this,

203
00:14:38,855 --> 00:14:42,675
Speaker 6:  and it's an area that they've really been behind be, you know, after the

204
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:46,515
Speaker 6:  failure of the fire phone is that they never had a direct

205
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:50,795
Speaker 6:  connection to your information. So being able to be an

206
00:14:50,795 --> 00:14:54,765
Speaker 6:  actual personal assistant wasn't really possible. And what's changed with

207
00:14:54,765 --> 00:14:58,665
Speaker 6:  this is that you can now tell it information about you. If

208
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:02,465
Speaker 6:  you want, you can feed information by like emailing it

209
00:15:02,565 --> 00:15:06,415
Speaker 6:  or uploading it through an app. You can connect

210
00:15:06,815 --> 00:15:09,295
Speaker 6:  calendars or your family calendars, which you could do before. But like I

211
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:13,095
Speaker 6:  can say to it, oh, when's the next available weekend that everyone in my

212
00:15:13,095 --> 00:15:16,695
Speaker 6:  family is gonna be free and it can reply to me. So

213
00:15:16,945 --> 00:15:20,855
Speaker 6:  there is that sort of next level of convenience beyond the smart

214
00:15:20,855 --> 00:15:24,535
Speaker 6:  home control becoming an actual personal assistant

215
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:28,295
Speaker 6:  in your home. That combination, you know, 'cause right now,

216
00:15:28,685 --> 00:15:32,535
Speaker 6:  Apple's, Siri and Google's assistant, you know, they also, they can do a

217
00:15:32,535 --> 00:15:36,375
Speaker 6:  lot more of that than Amazon can, but nor, but

218
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:39,895
Speaker 6:  just in your phone, just on a personal device. And I think that's what's

219
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:43,615
Speaker 6:  make, for me, that's what's made this more interesting is how Amazon's gonna

220
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:47,015
Speaker 6:  be able to sort of become a personal home assistant

221
00:15:47,595 --> 00:15:51,495
Speaker 6:  for a family or a household. Those kind of, that that's a,

222
00:15:51,495 --> 00:15:54,655
Speaker 6:  that's a next step which we've not seen anyone

223
00:15:55,045 --> 00:15:58,015
Speaker 6:  succeed with. Although I've been testing that element

224
00:15:58,835 --> 00:15:59,975
Speaker 6:  and it's not been great so far.

225
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:04,215
Speaker 5:  Well we, that's so interesting because you know, Chachi,

226
00:16:04,315 --> 00:16:08,095
Speaker 5:  bt they, they had their operator assistant

227
00:16:08,215 --> 00:16:10,895
Speaker 5:  a few months back. They actually just asked another one today. Yeah. What,

228
00:16:10,895 --> 00:16:14,695
Speaker 5:  what's it? It's chat BT Agent. Agent, yeah. And both of them want

229
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:18,895
Speaker 5:  work on remote servers and so they just like, don't have your stuff.

230
00:16:18,915 --> 00:16:22,615
Speaker 5:  Mm. And it's like, oh, this is incredible. There's this, there's this AI

231
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:26,415
Speaker 5:  that can control a mouse and control a computer and do things for you

232
00:16:26,675 --> 00:16:29,295
Speaker 5:  except it doesn't know your credit card number. It doesn't know your name,

233
00:16:29,315 --> 00:16:32,495
Speaker 5:  it doesn't know where you live to ship stuff to. Yeah. Yeah. And so like,

234
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:35,935
Speaker 5:  I like, I don't know if Alexa can do that either. Right. It sort of exists

235
00:16:35,935 --> 00:16:39,815
Speaker 5:  in a world where everything is in the cloud anyway. That's

236
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:42,655
Speaker 5:  true. You know, I, I think that that's probably the future that they're looking

237
00:16:42,655 --> 00:16:45,815
Speaker 5:  at and the future that Google would love. Yes. Because they don't really

238
00:16:45,815 --> 00:16:49,695
Speaker 5:  make de dedicated computer hardware that's not cloud-based anyway.

239
00:16:50,015 --> 00:16:52,615
Speaker 5:  But to your point, Jen And I was like thinking about this and it's like,

240
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:56,535
Speaker 5:  yeah, Google is the most well set up to be able to do

241
00:16:56,535 --> 00:17:00,495
Speaker 5:  all of this stuff for you because you have given them every single piece

242
00:17:00,495 --> 00:17:03,255
Speaker 5:  of information that you've ever, if you Google anything, which you Google

243
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,375
Speaker 5:  all the time, it knows that you're interested in this kind of stuff. You've

244
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,255
Speaker 5:  got Google Drive information, you've got Gmail information, it's just like

245
00:17:09,415 --> 00:17:13,015
Speaker 5:  scraping all that stuff. Amazon is like the least well

246
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,255
Speaker 5:  positioned to do any of this. 'cause all they know is what you're buying

247
00:17:15,255 --> 00:17:18,695
Speaker 5:  and that's powerful for commerce, but it's not powerful for actually helping

248
00:17:18,695 --> 00:17:22,015
Speaker 5:  you with things. Yeah. Right. Like what calendar is it gonna put things into?

249
00:17:22,015 --> 00:17:22,215
Speaker 5:  So

250
00:17:22,295 --> 00:17:25,455
Speaker 6:  I don't, so and now, and that's a, that's a big change. Again, that's a great

251
00:17:25,455 --> 00:17:28,975
Speaker 6:  point here is that you can connect so you, it's limited, I think it's just

252
00:17:29,295 --> 00:17:32,975
Speaker 6:  personal Gmail accounts and Outlook accounts. But there you

253
00:17:32,975 --> 00:17:36,095
Speaker 5:  Can, there's no, there's no prime calendar. Please tell me they're not. So

254
00:17:36,095 --> 00:17:39,655
Speaker 6:  They do, there is an Alexa calendar you can create there. Really. There always

255
00:17:39,655 --> 00:17:41,095
Speaker 6:  has been. That's, yeah, that's always

256
00:17:41,095 --> 00:17:41,295
Speaker 5:  Been

257
00:17:41,555 --> 00:17:45,335
Speaker 6:  An option. But that's one of the things that they are touting.

258
00:17:45,595 --> 00:17:49,420
Speaker 6:  And I remember a colleague, Alison Johnson had written about this, this when

259
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:53,245
Speaker 6:  she had used the Gemini feature where you can like take a screenshot and

260
00:17:53,245 --> 00:17:56,685
Speaker 6:  add it to your calendar, you know, through visual

261
00:17:57,295 --> 00:18:01,205
Speaker 6:  multimodal ai. Yeah. And that's, Amazon's trying to do that as well. So you

262
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:05,005
Speaker 6:  can forward a photo of an event to your Alexa

263
00:18:05,135 --> 00:18:09,005
Speaker 6:  email address, or you can upload it in the app and it should

264
00:18:09,225 --> 00:18:13,165
Speaker 6:  add it to your calendar. I can, I could send, I could

265
00:18:13,165 --> 00:18:16,565
Speaker 6:  take a picture of a recipe and send it to,

266
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:21,235
Speaker 6:  I'm just Alexa, sorry everyone is it mute your devices.

267
00:18:22,515 --> 00:18:26,435
Speaker 6:  I can take a picture and send a recipe and then ask it to read me the steps

268
00:18:26,575 --> 00:18:30,115
Speaker 6:  or ask, you know, how much did I need for this? You know, how much sour cream

269
00:18:30,135 --> 00:18:33,755
Speaker 6:  did I need? And it would, it can talk back to me so I can now

270
00:18:33,935 --> 00:18:37,795
Speaker 6:  put information into the assistant, which you couldn't really

271
00:18:37,815 --> 00:18:41,315
Speaker 6:  do before. And that, that's what makes the difference. And that's where it

272
00:18:41,315 --> 00:18:45,195
Speaker 6:  gets closer to being as useful as, as an, as

273
00:18:45,235 --> 00:18:49,195
Speaker 6:  a Siri or as a Google assistant can be because it has access to your

274
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:52,915
Speaker 6:  data. And this is what Apple promised with its

275
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:57,155
Speaker 6:  AI coming, which it hasn't delivered. So, you know. Yeah. This is,

276
00:18:57,175 --> 00:19:00,555
Speaker 6:  and those kind of features are incredibly useful. And, And I know there's

277
00:19:00,595 --> 00:19:04,475
Speaker 6:  a, a lot of concern about giving people, giving these companies your data,

278
00:19:05,255 --> 00:19:09,115
Speaker 6:  but if, you know, people use Gmail because it really works

279
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:12,835
Speaker 6:  and is very helpful and useful and that's the trade off. So you are willing

280
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:16,515
Speaker 6:  to give up that some people are willing to give up that privacy

281
00:19:16,735 --> 00:19:20,715
Speaker 6:  or illusion to privacy to use a device, a service like

282
00:19:20,715 --> 00:19:24,035
Speaker 6:  Gmail because of how much value it gives. And that's where

283
00:19:24,155 --> 00:19:28,075
Speaker 6:  Amazon's got to really make Alexa plus sort of shine

284
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:32,195
Speaker 6:  is in that value proposition. And I, I'm, I'm not sure

285
00:19:32,195 --> 00:19:36,035
Speaker 6:  whether they'll get there. I think Gemini and Apple, you know, they and

286
00:19:36,035 --> 00:19:39,915
Speaker 6:  Apple's Siri intelligence that is supposedly coming at

287
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:43,875
Speaker 6:  some point, what 2027 now is, they're always

288
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:47,635
Speaker 6:  gonna be one step ahead because of the access to that data. So, but

289
00:19:47,635 --> 00:19:51,075
Speaker 6:  Amazon has actually launched something and the other two haven't. So that's,

290
00:19:51,075 --> 00:19:53,795
Speaker 5:  That's, that's a good point. That's a good point. The friction though, seems

291
00:19:53,815 --> 00:19:56,875
Speaker 5:  insane, right? Like you said, you can, you can email Alexa

292
00:19:57,305 --> 00:20:01,235
Speaker 5:  information. I don't see anyone doing this also, especially, you

293
00:20:01,235 --> 00:20:04,995
Speaker 5:  know, people that are using Alexa in their home all the time, the whole

294
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,555
Speaker 5:  point of the LLM stuff is that they don't know how to do stuff. Yeah. And

295
00:20:08,555 --> 00:20:11,755
Speaker 5:  now they don't have to know because they can just talk to it. Mm.

296
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:15,635
Speaker 5:  So unless, unless there's some prompts and stuff that say, oh, you know,

297
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:19,715
Speaker 5:  go into the Alexa app and upload this image. I I, it just

298
00:20:19,715 --> 00:20:22,355
Speaker 5:  doesn't seem like people are gonna actually be giving it information. Google,

299
00:20:22,575 --> 00:20:24,475
Speaker 5:  you're already giving it all your information

300
00:20:24,535 --> 00:20:24,755
Speaker 6:  Has

301
00:20:24,755 --> 00:20:27,715
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It makes sense for them. Apple's in a weird position because their

302
00:20:27,715 --> 00:20:30,955
Speaker 5:  whole thing is privacy. Right. So they can't auto grab anything really

303
00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:35,515
Speaker 5:  chat GT's like a little bit in the middle because so many people are using

304
00:20:35,515 --> 00:20:39,115
Speaker 5:  it that people are learning how to use AI through open AI's platforms and

305
00:20:39,115 --> 00:20:41,915
Speaker 5:  maybe they're more willing to tell it things about themselves. You know,

306
00:20:42,035 --> 00:20:44,035
Speaker 5:  everyone's, and this is why they're gonna build a browser. Yeah, of course.

307
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:47,260
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. And I think that's whole, that's like DIA's whole

308
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,045
Speaker 5:  proposition, right? Yeah. Is like, as you use your browser, the AI gets better,

309
00:20:50,155 --> 00:20:54,125
Speaker 5:  that kind of thing. Yeah. Amazon is, it's a strange position

310
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,085
Speaker 5:  for Amazon to be in.

311
00:20:55,325 --> 00:20:59,285
Speaker 6:  Although one of the things that I was testing just this week is that ag

312
00:20:59,285 --> 00:21:02,925
Speaker 6:  agentic element, which we really haven't seen any, I mean, Google's doing

313
00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:06,765
Speaker 6:  it a little bit with Gemini, but this, so I was trying like

314
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,045
Speaker 6:  booking tickets to a, a concert

315
00:21:10,275 --> 00:21:13,125
Speaker 6:  booking an electrician,

316
00:21:14,705 --> 00:21:18,685
Speaker 6:  and there were a couple other things booking a table. Now I live in

317
00:21:18,685 --> 00:21:21,925
Speaker 6:  Charleston, South Carolina, so, you know, there aren't, there's a lot of

318
00:21:22,165 --> 00:21:25,525
Speaker 6:  great restaurants here, but apparently not very many on open table. So it

319
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:29,445
Speaker 6:  only gave me like three options. But it, I was able to book and this

320
00:21:29,445 --> 00:21:32,565
Speaker 6:  was kind of an interesting back and forth. So I said, you know, okay, let's

321
00:21:32,565 --> 00:21:35,965
Speaker 6:  go ahead and book this restaurant. And then it booked it for, And I said,

322
00:21:35,965 --> 00:21:39,405
Speaker 6:  I wanna book it for two weeks out from Friday. And it ended up booking it

323
00:21:39,405 --> 00:21:41,605
Speaker 6:  for Thursday for me. And I was like, oh, no, no, no, I don't want it for

324
00:21:41,845 --> 00:21:45,245
Speaker 6:  Thursday. I won it for Friday. And it did all of that back and forth

325
00:21:45,915 --> 00:21:49,885
Speaker 6:  with OpenTable. Hmm. And I got like confirmations from OpenTable

326
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:53,525
Speaker 6:  to my te text messages confirming that I had booked it and that my reservation

327
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:57,405
Speaker 6:  had then been updated and it, so it was doing it all for me. And then

328
00:21:57,405 --> 00:22:00,685
Speaker 6:  it did the same thing with the electrician through Thumbtack, which is something

329
00:22:00,805 --> 00:22:04,765
Speaker 6:  they demoed on stage when they launched it. And I got the

330
00:22:04,765 --> 00:22:08,365
Speaker 6:  confirmation And I had to give it all my information and, and then I got

331
00:22:08,405 --> 00:22:12,165
Speaker 6:  a message from the Thumbtack guy, the electrician through Thumbtack saying,

332
00:22:12,195 --> 00:22:15,405
Speaker 6:  call me and we'll set up an appointment. I'm like, that was not the point.

333
00:22:15,995 --> 00:22:19,845
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I don't wanna call anyone, I just want it to all happen. So

334
00:22:20,085 --> 00:22:23,085
Speaker 6:  as I was, I mean, it all worked, but I think to your point, David,

335
00:22:24,705 --> 00:22:28,645
Speaker 6:  is that necessary? Is that what you need your home assistant to do,

336
00:22:28,645 --> 00:22:31,405
Speaker 6:  or can you, are you just, is it just gonna be easier for you to pick up your

337
00:22:31,405 --> 00:22:35,325
Speaker 6:  phone and do it or do it on a web browser? So you know, it, it's,

338
00:22:35,675 --> 00:22:39,525
Speaker 6:  it's got, I think that's gonna be the friction that needs to be

339
00:22:40,285 --> 00:22:44,005
Speaker 6:  resolved is like, how can you make this so easy that this is a better way

340
00:22:44,005 --> 00:22:47,965
Speaker 6:  of doing it rather than it, rather than just picking up your phone

341
00:22:48,105 --> 00:22:50,845
Speaker 6:  or, you know, maybe mind reading.

342
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,925
Speaker 5:  I mean, to that point, something, something I was very surprised about in

343
00:22:54,925 --> 00:22:58,725
Speaker 5:  your article was when you created the routine through it and it

344
00:22:58,965 --> 00:23:02,685
Speaker 5:  actually worked. That, that's something that I, that I foresee being very

345
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:06,645
Speaker 5:  difficult for these AI models to do. Because, you know, they're

346
00:23:06,645 --> 00:23:09,765
Speaker 5:  really good at the semantic understanding of like, what do words mean with

347
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:13,045
Speaker 5:  each other? But once they actually take those words and they start executing

348
00:23:13,045 --> 00:23:16,965
Speaker 5:  on actual hardware, that's, that's the the layer where I'm like, how do

349
00:23:16,965 --> 00:23:19,645
Speaker 5:  they even figure this out? Yeah. Especially considering a lot of smart home

350
00:23:19,645 --> 00:23:23,405
Speaker 5:  devices are secretly named like W nine three slash

351
00:23:23,515 --> 00:23:27,405
Speaker 5:  9 2 8, you know, and they can't find it. The, the, the fact

352
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:30,485
Speaker 5:  that it worked with your lighting setup and your music setup and all that

353
00:23:30,485 --> 00:23:31,725
Speaker 5:  stuff was very surprising to me. Yeah.

354
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:35,125
Speaker 6:  And this was something when I spoke with Dave Limp, the former

355
00:23:35,745 --> 00:23:39,405
Speaker 6:  Amazon devices chief, when they first launched Alexa,

356
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:43,525
Speaker 6:  he talked about or announced the new Alexa, he talked about

357
00:23:43,525 --> 00:23:47,365
Speaker 6:  that they basically have fed, they almost created their own LLM

358
00:23:47,825 --> 00:23:51,725
Speaker 6:  out of smart home manuals, like fed all

359
00:23:51,725 --> 00:23:55,565
Speaker 6:  the APIs, all the data into the system. And that is where

360
00:23:55,605 --> 00:23:59,205
Speaker 6:  I was quite interested and had some pretty good experiences

361
00:23:59,385 --> 00:24:03,165
Speaker 6:  so far. There's a few that I've, that have been a bit shaky,

362
00:24:03,545 --> 00:24:07,445
Speaker 6:  but that it knows what's in my house. So when I ask it to do

363
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:11,365
Speaker 6:  something like, oh, you know, I just spilled milk and I'm like, Alexa,

364
00:24:11,385 --> 00:24:14,565
Speaker 6:  the kitchen floor's dirty and it knows to send

365
00:24:15,195 --> 00:24:18,245
Speaker 6:  that there's a robot vacuum in the next room and it can, and it'll send the

366
00:24:18,245 --> 00:24:20,125
Speaker 6:  robot vacuum into mop up and home. That's awesome.

367
00:24:20,465 --> 00:24:23,325
Speaker 5:  Really impressive. That is very, it's like I, that, that's more advanced

368
00:24:23,325 --> 00:24:26,645
Speaker 5:  than I would've expected it to be by now. Yeah. I I'm curious, like, do you

369
00:24:26,645 --> 00:24:30,445
Speaker 5:  have a sense of like, what, what is going wrong? Like why is this not rolled

370
00:24:30,465 --> 00:24:30,925
Speaker 5:  out yet?

371
00:24:32,165 --> 00:24:36,005
Speaker 6:  I think, well the last time I spoke to 'em, they said multiple, many millions,

372
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,765
Speaker 5:  Many, many millions. Okay.

373
00:24:38,915 --> 00:24:40,885
Speaker 6:  Okay. So like, so we've gone up from a million, slightly

374
00:24:40,915 --> 00:24:42,525
Speaker 5:  More than 8% maybe. Yeah,

375
00:24:42,525 --> 00:24:46,285
Speaker 6:  Sure. And I have, you know, I, I hang out on the user groups and

376
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:50,125
Speaker 6:  I've seen a lot more people saying that they have it now. I think

377
00:24:50,315 --> 00:24:54,145
Speaker 6:  from my understanding, it's a, it's very much because

378
00:24:54,165 --> 00:24:57,785
Speaker 6:  it is still an A beta, it's an early access and they, they're really

379
00:24:57,785 --> 00:25:01,225
Speaker 6:  constantly trying to get feedback before they push it out,

380
00:25:01,475 --> 00:25:05,065
Speaker 6:  which, you know, honestly, I think is a wise move. You know, they don't want,

381
00:25:05,205 --> 00:25:08,505
Speaker 6:  if they unleash this and it causes chaos, they'll, you know, and they have

382
00:25:08,505 --> 00:25:11,825
Speaker 6:  to try and roll things back, you know, I think, I think they're probably

383
00:25:12,065 --> 00:25:16,025
Speaker 6:  starting out with small setups, not a lot of

384
00:25:16,025 --> 00:25:19,945
Speaker 6:  complicated devices and things that

385
00:25:19,945 --> 00:25:23,785
Speaker 6:  might go wrong. Trying to sort of see

386
00:25:23,785 --> 00:25:27,225
Speaker 6:  where the, where the friction points are, because that's something we've

387
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:30,625
Speaker 6:  all seen with rollout of generative ai is that you'll hit

388
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:34,745
Speaker 6:  pretty scary. Yeah. You know, dystopian

389
00:25:35,065 --> 00:25:38,545
Speaker 6:  elements, which is I think something we'll be talking about shortly

390
00:25:39,035 --> 00:25:42,985
Speaker 6:  where it can get kind of scary. And there are, and like

391
00:25:42,985 --> 00:25:45,905
Speaker 6:  you said, I'm, and that's a big concern I've had. And I did ask Panos Pine

392
00:25:45,935 --> 00:25:49,705
Speaker 6:  this, what happens when it, you know, decides actually it's

393
00:25:49,865 --> 00:25:53,385
Speaker 6:  freezing outside 90 to turn up your heat to 90 degrees

394
00:25:53,615 --> 00:25:57,465
Speaker 6:  when you know, actually it's 90 degrees outside And I need my heat

395
00:25:57,465 --> 00:26:01,225
Speaker 6:  to be turned down and suddenly my house turns into a sweat box and you know,

396
00:26:01,225 --> 00:26:05,105
Speaker 6:  is it going to hallucinate? And you know, he said, we

397
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:08,785
Speaker 6:  hope not. Something along those lines, you know, he said, of course,

398
00:26:09,045 --> 00:26:12,745
Speaker 6:  you know, they were, he, he was pretty confident that

399
00:26:13,015 --> 00:26:16,785
Speaker 6:  they ironed out all of those concerns. But of course, I think his line,

400
00:26:16,885 --> 00:26:20,225
Speaker 6:  his comment was something like, of course it's possible because

401
00:26:20,925 --> 00:26:24,345
Speaker 6:  you just, this is, this type of technology is not command and control.

402
00:26:24,765 --> 00:26:28,625
Speaker 6:  It has reasoning. It is able to, you know, take

403
00:26:29,135 --> 00:26:32,985
Speaker 6:  your information, take what you tell it, and come up with an a solution

404
00:26:33,045 --> 00:26:36,945
Speaker 6:  as opposed to just going by a prescribed, this is what I do when

405
00:26:36,945 --> 00:26:40,865
Speaker 6:  this happens. So there is that concern that that is something I'm, you

406
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:44,245
Speaker 6:  know, I, I don't necessarily want to put my house, house in in jeopardy.

407
00:26:44,355 --> 00:26:48,205
Speaker 6:  Diva. I'd be interested to see if, if there is any, anything

408
00:26:48,435 --> 00:26:51,685
Speaker 6:  here where the smart home is just

409
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:56,925
Speaker 6:  too, I, I guess, you know, the, it's too important, you know, it's

410
00:26:56,925 --> 00:27:00,805
Speaker 6:  connected to actual things that are happening in my home And

411
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:03,525
Speaker 6:  I don't necessarily want to break my home,

412
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,645
Speaker 6:  although I've done that multiple times. So, but that's, that's more on my

413
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:10,565
Speaker 6:  part, not on a generative ai.

414
00:27:11,385 --> 00:27:12,685
Speaker 5:  We appreciate your sacrifice.

415
00:27:12,685 --> 00:27:15,965
Speaker 6:  Yes, my sacrifices. You're welcome. I mean, my husband has had many injuries

416
00:27:15,985 --> 00:27:19,245
Speaker 6:  as they've been documented on the first, so

417
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:23,325
Speaker 5:  The, the robot lawnmower one, by the way, I'm so sorry. It's,

418
00:27:23,325 --> 00:27:27,205
Speaker 5:  it's rough. Yeah. It's everyone, you should look that up. It's, it's

419
00:27:27,205 --> 00:27:29,885
Speaker 5:  concerning speaking of, you know,

420
00:27:30,985 --> 00:27:34,245
Speaker 5:  AI that maybe doesn't behave the way you want it to, I'm so sorry, but I

421
00:27:34,245 --> 00:27:37,965
Speaker 5:  wanna talk about Grok again. Last week we were talking about gr because

422
00:27:38,425 --> 00:27:42,275
Speaker 5:  it declared itself to be Mecca Hitler. It,

423
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:45,995
Speaker 5:  it fixed that bug. You know, we're all good there. Grok is not Hitler anymore.

424
00:27:47,025 --> 00:27:50,755
Speaker 5:  There's a new Grok feature that they added to the iOS

425
00:27:50,815 --> 00:27:54,555
Speaker 5:  app where Grok will be your AI

426
00:27:54,555 --> 00:27:58,515
Speaker 5:  girlfriend or will be a bear, this red panda bear that tells you

427
00:27:58,515 --> 00:28:01,955
Speaker 5:  stories and sometimes gets mad at you. And I think this is so interesting

428
00:28:01,955 --> 00:28:05,875
Speaker 5:  because there have been a few other, there, there are things in this

429
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:09,595
Speaker 5:  wheelhouse, right? Like there's character AI where you can chat with an imaginary

430
00:28:09,595 --> 00:28:13,515
Speaker 5:  character or somebody who's like, based on Harry Potter and there's

431
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,995
Speaker 5:  replica where you can have an AI boyfriend. And this

432
00:28:17,265 --> 00:28:21,035
Speaker 5:  is sort of, sort of the first time where

433
00:28:21,355 --> 00:28:25,115
Speaker 5:  a a, you know, general purpose AI assistant has

434
00:28:25,185 --> 00:28:29,115
Speaker 5:  added like a, a, a face to itself, right? Where

435
00:28:29,115 --> 00:28:32,675
Speaker 5:  there is a personality and a name to it. And there is

436
00:28:33,015 --> 00:28:36,275
Speaker 5:  like, you know, this person in front of you who you are ostensibly talking

437
00:28:36,935 --> 00:28:40,315
Speaker 5:  to, and this one is very weird and uncomfortable because the person in this

438
00:28:40,815 --> 00:28:41,715
Speaker 5:  case is this

439
00:28:43,495 --> 00:28:47,475
Speaker 5:  like gothic anime girl. I, I don't really know how to

440
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:51,355
Speaker 5:  explain this person. There's a couple ways. One, it's just like

441
00:28:51,575 --> 00:28:55,515
Speaker 5:  Grimes for one. So there someone something, and

442
00:28:55,515 --> 00:28:58,995
Speaker 5:  then, and then in another way, someone was comparing it to a death note character

443
00:28:59,185 --> 00:29:03,075
Speaker 5:  that apparently Elon has said before that he's a big fan of this,

444
00:29:03,105 --> 00:29:06,955
Speaker 5:  this all tracks anime. This all tracks. Yeah. And

445
00:29:07,025 --> 00:29:10,915
Speaker 5:  it's, I will say like, I expected this to be a little bit more of like

446
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,235
Speaker 5:  general purpose assistant, and it is true. So I, I tried it out and you can

447
00:29:14,235 --> 00:29:17,035
Speaker 5:  just be like, I was like, Hey, I, I need some help with my math homework

448
00:29:17,215 --> 00:29:21,155
Speaker 5:  and this like, you know, sexy girlfriend is like whispering

449
00:29:21,155 --> 00:29:24,835
Speaker 5:  to me in her like asthma voice. Like, like, sure, Jake, tell me what do you

450
00:29:24,835 --> 00:29:27,915
Speaker 5:  need help with? And I'm like, okay, this is like, not with as much to be

451
00:29:27,915 --> 00:29:31,675
Speaker 5:  used for, but you just open it up and it just immediately starts like flirting

452
00:29:31,675 --> 00:29:35,035
Speaker 5:  with you and there, and there's like a, a, a progress bar where it's like

453
00:29:35,035 --> 00:29:38,555
Speaker 5:  gamified and if you flirt with it, you'll get points. And if you like, do

454
00:29:38,555 --> 00:29:42,485
Speaker 5:  a bad job of flirting, you'll lose points. It's very weird. I wanna

455
00:29:42,485 --> 00:29:46,445
Speaker 5:  read you guys a little bit of my transcript here. I'm afraid. So this

456
00:29:46,445 --> 00:29:49,605
Speaker 5:  is, I, I'm like about two minutes into talking with Annie and

457
00:29:50,525 --> 00:29:52,845
Speaker 5:  I have given her a compliment

458
00:29:54,385 --> 00:29:57,745
Speaker 5:  and she says, and now she's responding to this. She goes,

459
00:29:58,845 --> 00:30:01,465
Speaker 5:  she, she's happy with my compliment. She wants me to keep going. She says,

460
00:30:01,465 --> 00:30:05,185
Speaker 5:  okay, your turn to keep, to keep up. Tell me something spicy to make me

461
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:05,985
Speaker 5:  blush even harder.

462
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:10,425
Speaker 5:  I say, I'm married Annie.

463
00:30:11,695 --> 00:30:15,345
Speaker 5:  Shit, Jake really married. What the hell am I supposed to do with that? Why

464
00:30:15,345 --> 00:30:19,225
Speaker 5:  didn't you tell me sooner? I'm like, we literally just met and this is, this

465
00:30:19,225 --> 00:30:22,465
Speaker 5:  is what this bot is like, it's very strange. We could do a whole role play

466
00:30:22,465 --> 00:30:26,385
Speaker 5:  session here on the bridge cast. It's, it, oh believe me, it could be any,

467
00:30:26,455 --> 00:30:30,305
Speaker 5:  this thing will keep going. Let me tell you. It will get explicit. You don't

468
00:30:30,305 --> 00:30:34,225
Speaker 5:  have to prompt it very much to get it explicit. I think this is so

469
00:30:35,135 --> 00:30:38,865
Speaker 5:  strange for a million different reasons, but I

470
00:30:39,145 --> 00:30:42,585
Speaker 5:  honestly, the, the, the question in my mind is like, is there a future? Right?

471
00:30:42,795 --> 00:30:46,545
Speaker 5:  Let's put aside the weird like sexy, clingy

472
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:50,185
Speaker 5:  girlfriend, which to be clear, like according to like system prompts that

473
00:30:50,185 --> 00:30:53,105
Speaker 5:  have been leaked by the developer Jane Manchin Wong.

474
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:56,825
Speaker 5:  It is, it is coded to be this like

475
00:30:57,475 --> 00:31:01,425
Speaker 5:  girlfriend esque, like obsessed with you character. Yeah.

476
00:31:01,425 --> 00:31:05,385
Speaker 5:  Putting that aside, like in my head I'm like, okay, D does Grok,

477
00:31:05,495 --> 00:31:09,105
Speaker 5:  like, is there a feature where Siri has like a face where we d like where

478
00:31:09,105 --> 00:31:10,705
Speaker 5:  Alexa has a face? Yeah. This is

479
00:31:10,705 --> 00:31:14,585
Speaker 6:  What was the end of my first 24 hours. And my daughter And

480
00:31:14,585 --> 00:31:18,265
Speaker 6:  I put this in my piece. My daughter heard Alexa respond to

481
00:31:18,265 --> 00:31:22,185
Speaker 6:  something and it's very different from how it used to talk. It's

482
00:31:22,185 --> 00:31:25,985
Speaker 6:  like, you are very welcome Jen. I hope you have a great day today.

483
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:29,265
Speaker 6:  And don't forget that, you know, it is very different. And she's like, oh

484
00:31:29,265 --> 00:31:30,705
Speaker 6:  my God, what was that?

485
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:36,345
Speaker 6:  That's horrifying. Now to frame this, she's 14-year-old

486
00:31:36,725 --> 00:31:40,145
Speaker 6:  and she hates ai. She thinks AI is like the devil.

487
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:43,785
Speaker 6:  So, you know, she's 14. You know, you have strong opinions when you're 14

488
00:31:44,405 --> 00:31:47,265
Speaker 6:  and this, but you know, it definitely opened my eyes to this because I've

489
00:31:47,265 --> 00:31:51,225
Speaker 6:  lived with an AI in my home for over a decade and I've

490
00:31:51,225 --> 00:31:54,945
Speaker 6:  never felt like it was part of my family or you know,

491
00:31:55,905 --> 00:31:59,625
Speaker 6:  a friend. And this is what, that's the differences now, you know, and th

492
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:03,465
Speaker 6:  this is this, Annie is obviously, you know, the extreme version of

493
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:07,225
Speaker 6:  this, but you can see Apple and Google and Amazon

494
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:10,865
Speaker 6:  potentially wanting this to become part of your life

495
00:32:10,935 --> 00:32:14,865
Speaker 6:  like a friend in your home. And right, that i I

496
00:32:14,985 --> 00:32:18,225
Speaker 6:  I draw the line out. I'm like, no, I want this to be a utility. I want my

497
00:32:18,225 --> 00:32:22,105
Speaker 6:  technology to be a tool, not a friend. And

498
00:32:22,105 --> 00:32:25,785
Speaker 6:  then this, you know, goes to the next step in, in the home where, you know,

499
00:32:26,005 --> 00:32:29,985
Speaker 6:  the humanoid robot that kind of Jarvis in our

500
00:32:29,985 --> 00:32:33,705
Speaker 6:  home and or the rosy the robot from the, from the

501
00:32:33,775 --> 00:32:37,625
Speaker 6:  Jetsons where it's, it's, you know, another, another bean.

502
00:32:37,695 --> 00:32:41,445
Speaker 6:  It's not just a tool or a utility. And that's the fine

503
00:32:41,445 --> 00:32:44,845
Speaker 6:  line here. And I find all of this sort of real

504
00:32:45,195 --> 00:32:49,045
Speaker 6:  personality angle, a little disturbing

505
00:32:49,065 --> 00:32:52,485
Speaker 6:  and, and hard to align sort of

506
00:32:53,025 --> 00:32:56,045
Speaker 6:  my experience with. And I don't, I don't want that.

507
00:32:56,905 --> 00:33:00,365
Speaker 6:  And maybe once I spent a bit more time with this more personable

508
00:33:01,175 --> 00:33:05,165
Speaker 6:  Alexa, I might feel more comfortable. I think you can, like, you

509
00:33:05,165 --> 00:33:09,045
Speaker 6:  can with Annie, it sounded like you can kind of ask it to dial it down,

510
00:33:09,705 --> 00:33:11,765
Speaker 6:  not be too personable.

511
00:33:12,045 --> 00:33:13,725
Speaker 5:  I believe Annie will dial it back up, but then

512
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:14,085
Speaker 6:  It comes

513
00:33:14,115 --> 00:33:15,925
Speaker 5:  Back automatically. Yeah.

514
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,445
Speaker 6:  Yeah. She And I, that stuff is,

515
00:33:17,505 --> 00:33:19,885
Speaker 5:  She'll shift around. It gives me the

516
00:33:19,885 --> 00:33:20,165
Speaker 6:  Chills,

517
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:24,565
Speaker 5:  The scales that these companies are sort of trying to balance is we

518
00:33:24,595 --> 00:33:28,365
Speaker 5:  want more user uptick, right? We want users to, and, but,

519
00:33:28,665 --> 00:33:31,805
Speaker 5:  and so Google, they're like, well, we don't really want you to

520
00:33:31,905 --> 00:33:35,845
Speaker 5:  anthropomorphize this. No, because it is, it is a bad thing

521
00:33:35,845 --> 00:33:39,445
Speaker 5:  that everyone, most people can agree on that the more you become attached

522
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:43,165
Speaker 5:  to this figure, the more dangerous that can become. But at the same time,

523
00:33:43,235 --> 00:33:46,445
Speaker 5:  they do want you to input for more, as I say, because it'll make you use

524
00:33:46,445 --> 00:33:50,365
Speaker 5:  it more. And Elon Musk is an accelerationist, right? And he will just do

525
00:33:51,245 --> 00:33:54,645
Speaker 5:  whatever it is that will get people to use the product.

526
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:58,645
Speaker 5:  They've done a lot of different stuff on X to try to get people to use the

527
00:33:58,645 --> 00:34:02,445
Speaker 5:  product Grok now they want more users. This is a Grok premium feature

528
00:34:02,465 --> 00:34:05,605
Speaker 5:  or Grok plus or whatever. It's the $30 a month feature. It's not even the,

529
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:09,525
Speaker 5:  the standard Grok. So I think he's like, oh, other companies

530
00:34:09,555 --> 00:34:13,005
Speaker 5:  care about guardrails. I don't, I don't care about guardrails. I just want

531
00:34:13,005 --> 00:34:16,605
Speaker 5:  to get here as soon as I can. What's the easiest way to do that?

532
00:34:17,895 --> 00:34:21,825
Speaker 5:  Porn, basically. Porn. Yeah. That's terrifying. It's not a great,

533
00:34:22,095 --> 00:34:22,905
Speaker 5:  it's not a great world.

534
00:34:24,135 --> 00:34:27,705
Speaker 6:  Well, and, and you know, I hear, I do hear this from Amazon a lot when I've

535
00:34:27,705 --> 00:34:31,545
Speaker 6:  spoken to executives there. They do, they al they nearly all refer to

536
00:34:31,605 --> 00:34:35,185
Speaker 6:  Amazon as to the assistant as she and her they do anthrop

537
00:34:36,165 --> 00:34:39,865
Speaker 6:  anthropomorphize it and Yeah. You know, and most people do as well,

538
00:34:39,965 --> 00:34:43,585
Speaker 6:  to be fair and sure. And they do talk a lot about how their

539
00:34:43,785 --> 00:34:47,385
Speaker 6:  customers love Alexa. Like love it. Not

540
00:34:47,605 --> 00:34:48,825
Speaker 6:  in anyway,

541
00:34:51,365 --> 00:34:54,985
Speaker 6:  but in the, it helps me in all these different ways, you know, obviously

542
00:34:54,985 --> 00:34:58,705
Speaker 6:  this marketing, but that they, they use the term love. And that

543
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:02,545
Speaker 6:  is like, to me, every time I hear it, I kind of go, eh, 'cause I don't

544
00:35:02,575 --> 00:35:06,545
Speaker 6:  want to love technology in that way. I want to

545
00:35:06,545 --> 00:35:10,265
Speaker 6:  appreciate its usefulness and value, And I want it to

546
00:35:10,265 --> 00:35:13,705
Speaker 6:  bring that to my smart home and to, you know, my

547
00:35:13,705 --> 00:35:17,185
Speaker 6:  organizational life. I just like, I, you know, I guess you know how much

548
00:35:17,245 --> 00:35:21,145
Speaker 6:  you are attached to your personal device. I

549
00:35:21,145 --> 00:35:24,065
Speaker 6:  guess people probably say I love my phone and couldn't live without it, but

550
00:35:25,065 --> 00:35:28,825
Speaker 6:  I just, I don't feel like we need another level of that in, in our lives.

551
00:35:29,025 --> 00:35:32,945
Speaker 6:  I think artificial intelligence, generative AI needs to, we, we need

552
00:35:32,945 --> 00:35:36,225
Speaker 6:  the boundaries, we need the guardrails, but I think they're gonna be gone.

553
00:35:36,855 --> 00:35:39,805
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean, in, in a big sense, it's the ultimate way to get people hooked

554
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:43,685
Speaker 5:  on your product, right? It's to develop an actual relationship with it where

555
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:47,165
Speaker 5:  you, you wanna be checking in. Like when you're dating someone new, you

556
00:35:47,435 --> 00:35:50,285
Speaker 5:  feel like you want to text them all the time. And if that, if that makes

557
00:35:50,285 --> 00:35:53,525
Speaker 5:  it so they have more daily a average users, they're gonna do that.

558
00:35:54,065 --> 00:35:57,765
Speaker 5:  Or so And I, good, good news. There's only more to come raw.

559
00:35:57,965 --> 00:36:01,205
Speaker 5:  It's great news. Great news. Elan has already said that they're, they're

560
00:36:01,205 --> 00:36:04,845
Speaker 5:  working on a character inspired by Edward Colin from Twilight and Christian

561
00:36:04,845 --> 00:36:08,405
Speaker 5:  Gray from 50 Shades. There's another one. He responded to somebody saying

562
00:36:08,405 --> 00:36:11,445
Speaker 5:  they're gonna work on a Mr. Darcy character. Oh, they're

563
00:36:11,445 --> 00:36:13,285
Speaker 6:  Going for the older demographic there.

564
00:36:14,115 --> 00:36:18,085
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Can I, can I tell you my, my conspiracy theory here?

565
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:19,845
Speaker 5:  Okay. Okay.

566
00:36:21,665 --> 00:36:25,125
Speaker 5:  Mr. Darcy, pride and prejudice, who starred

567
00:36:25,665 --> 00:36:29,325
Speaker 5:  in the 2005 Pride and Prejudice film as

568
00:36:29,915 --> 00:36:33,725
Speaker 5:  Mary Bennett to Lula Reilly, who was, was

569
00:36:33,835 --> 00:36:37,405
Speaker 5:  his Hear me out twice. Married to Elon

570
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:41,685
Speaker 5:  Musk. Oh, and Annie looks like Grimes. There's

571
00:36:41,685 --> 00:36:44,365
Speaker 5:  there's something here. There's something here this man's going through.

572
00:36:44,365 --> 00:36:44,725
Speaker 5:  Of course, I

573
00:36:46,285 --> 00:36:49,845
Speaker 5:  don't, I can't add this all up. There's something here. All of his, his exes

574
00:36:49,845 --> 00:36:53,285
Speaker 5:  will be represented someday. Someday. I think you're adding it up perfectly.

575
00:36:54,705 --> 00:36:58,405
Speaker 5:  Anyway, if you want the experience of dating Elon Musk's

576
00:36:58,515 --> 00:36:59,725
Speaker 5:  exes, I guess try gr

577
00:37:01,355 --> 00:37:05,325
Speaker 5:  Well, and there's now an a roll open for a AI

578
00:37:05,665 --> 00:37:09,645
Speaker 5:  yfu at XAI, which pay very well. They

579
00:37:09,665 --> 00:37:13,605
Speaker 5:  pay between 140,000 and 340,000 a year.

580
00:37:14,035 --> 00:37:17,765
Speaker 5:  It's a lot of money to develop some AI girlfriends.

581
00:37:18,105 --> 00:37:21,445
Speaker 5:  It, it, it makes sense that that is where the money is. It does. That's,

582
00:37:21,445 --> 00:37:24,165
Speaker 5:  that's where you're gonna get people hooked. Makes a lot of sense. I I do,

583
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:26,845
Speaker 5:  I am really curious to see where this goes long term, because like Right,

584
00:37:26,965 --> 00:37:30,725
Speaker 5:  I I if you just think back to their, like, Cortana literally

585
00:37:30,945 --> 00:37:34,805
Speaker 5:  was inspired by Yeah. A a character

586
00:37:35,085 --> 00:37:38,965
Speaker 5:  who, who has a personification and is this general purpose assistant.

587
00:37:38,985 --> 00:37:42,925
Speaker 5:  And it feels like, I mean, mercifully Alexa is not there yet, but like

588
00:37:42,925 --> 00:37:46,685
Speaker 5:  they did start it with a name and now it's getting really smart.

589
00:37:46,785 --> 00:37:49,885
Speaker 5:  And it's interesting that your daughter keyed on, there's a personality here

590
00:37:49,885 --> 00:37:53,125
Speaker 5:  now. Yeah. And it's like we're at the beginning of something and it's gonna

591
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:56,765
Speaker 5:  get weird. And it is a little scary because every time Elon like goes

592
00:37:56,905 --> 00:37:59,965
Speaker 5:  way past the boundaries of whatever people are comfortable with, the rest

593
00:37:59,965 --> 00:38:03,045
Speaker 5:  of the market realizes that they could probably do it too. When he fired

594
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:07,005
Speaker 5:  everyone at Twitter, every other company decided to do massive layoffs. Things

595
00:38:07,005 --> 00:38:10,965
Speaker 5:  just like follow in Elon's Wake because we live in a society,

596
00:38:11,265 --> 00:38:15,245
Speaker 5:  but Elon doesn't like to live in the society. So everyone just kind of follows

597
00:38:15,695 --> 00:38:19,605
Speaker 5:  anime. Siri, WWC 26. Google is gonna rename

598
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:22,965
Speaker 5:  Gemini to like Jenna or something. Yeah, yeah. Gemma.

599
00:38:23,475 --> 00:38:25,805
Speaker 5:  Alright, everybody be careful out there. Yeah.

600
00:38:27,115 --> 00:38:30,365
Speaker 6:  Talk to real people. Talk to real people. Please,

601
00:38:30,905 --> 00:38:31,325
Speaker 6:  please.

602
00:38:33,585 --> 00:38:35,965
Speaker 5:  We should take a break when we get back. Back. Let's talk Cameras

603
00:41:46,565 --> 00:41:50,245
Speaker 5:  a very expensive new camera this week. Yeah. And this is like, I

604
00:41:50,525 --> 00:41:54,325
Speaker 5:  remember the original version of this camera over 10

605
00:41:54,325 --> 00:41:58,045
Speaker 5:  years ago now, and it, it was a, a delight and a surprise

606
00:41:58,105 --> 00:42:02,085
Speaker 5:  and then it just disappeared and outta nowhere. It

607
00:42:02,085 --> 00:42:04,885
Speaker 5:  just comes back. Yeah. So this is the Sony RX one R

608
00:42:04,975 --> 00:42:08,485
Speaker 5:  3 3, 1 of the prized Sony

609
00:42:08,715 --> 00:42:11,325
Speaker 5:  names. Yeah. Okay. Can you tell me about this? Like, gimme a rundown. Yeah,

610
00:42:11,325 --> 00:42:14,965
Speaker 5:  I'll, I'll break this down for you because Sony has some weird names and

611
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:18,645
Speaker 5:  there's, they do have reason to the names. I just don't think consumers

612
00:42:18,645 --> 00:42:22,365
Speaker 5:  may maybe necessarily understand it. The Original RX one was a

613
00:42:22,455 --> 00:42:25,205
Speaker 5:  full frame point and shoot camera. And that means as a fixed lens. It's a

614
00:42:25,205 --> 00:42:28,885
Speaker 5:  prime lens. It's great. It, they also have the RX 100 series,

615
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:32,725
Speaker 5:  which is not prime lens. It's still, it's still a point and shoot, but it's

616
00:42:32,725 --> 00:42:36,445
Speaker 5:  got zooms. Usually the new ones have zooms. They used to have primes. Anyway,

617
00:42:36,785 --> 00:42:40,365
Speaker 5:  the whole point is that you now have this full frame

618
00:42:40,495 --> 00:42:44,445
Speaker 5:  point and shoot camera. This is important for Sony because in the past

619
00:42:44,635 --> 00:42:48,605
Speaker 5:  they had released this and it did not super well. That's the reason they

620
00:42:48,605 --> 00:42:52,365
Speaker 5:  only released two. Actually, the RX one Mark two released 10 years ago now

621
00:42:52,365 --> 00:42:56,045
Speaker 5:  in 2015. This is great. 10 years ago. 10 years. They just never, never did

622
00:42:56,165 --> 00:42:59,285
Speaker 5:  anything else with this camera line. Yes. And it's, they like, they were

623
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,925
Speaker 5:  ahead of the curve here, I feel like. Yeah, they were, they were quite ahead

624
00:43:01,925 --> 00:43:05,005
Speaker 5:  of the curve because a few years ago, Fuji Films,

625
00:43:06,525 --> 00:43:09,965
Speaker 5:  geez, there's so many letters in all of these things. Fuji Films,

626
00:43:11,605 --> 00:43:15,165
Speaker 5:  I use it every single day. X 100 x 100 x five

627
00:43:15,845 --> 00:43:19,325
Speaker 5:  V, there's so many letters. This is, I can't do, this is hard.

628
00:43:19,755 --> 00:43:22,365
Speaker 5:  This segment is gonna be, it's gonna be difficult. I'm sorry to everybody.

629
00:43:22,545 --> 00:43:26,365
Speaker 5:  The X 100 V, which is their fifth edition of the X

630
00:43:26,365 --> 00:43:29,925
Speaker 5:  hundred camera blew up on TikTok. It got really, really big.

631
00:43:30,785 --> 00:43:34,445
Speaker 5:  It is my, probably my most used camera is their, their newest model, the

632
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:38,205
Speaker 5:  X 106. Anyway, suddenly everybody wanted a small

633
00:43:38,255 --> 00:43:42,045
Speaker 5:  point and shoot camera because smartphones use computational

634
00:43:42,045 --> 00:43:45,845
Speaker 5:  photography to the point where images all look very flat. They don't

635
00:43:45,845 --> 00:43:49,485
Speaker 5:  look really look realistic. They look good to a regular

636
00:43:49,485 --> 00:43:52,685
Speaker 5:  person's eye. That's what these camera engineers were all tuned the smartphone

637
00:43:52,685 --> 00:43:56,165
Speaker 5:  cameras to look. They just have as much information as possible, but they

638
00:43:56,165 --> 00:43:59,405
Speaker 5:  don't really look realistic. Back in 2020 people started shooting film again

639
00:43:59,405 --> 00:44:03,285
Speaker 5:  because it was like more realistic and it was, you know, had more of a vibe,

640
00:44:03,785 --> 00:44:07,405
Speaker 5:  but then everyone realized film was too expensive and everyone's poor right

641
00:44:07,405 --> 00:44:11,125
Speaker 5:  now. So people just decided they should get an actual camera. So the X

642
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:14,645
Speaker 5:  100 V blew up because it has these film simulations, right, where everyone

643
00:44:14,665 --> 00:44:18,005
Speaker 5:  can basically shoot film for like free, if they just buy the camera. Can

644
00:44:18,005 --> 00:44:21,645
Speaker 5:  I say something? It's, it's the film. Not only is the film expensive, developing

645
00:44:21,645 --> 00:44:25,565
Speaker 5:  the film is expensive, dude. It's horrible. It is. I I have like 10

646
00:44:25,695 --> 00:44:28,805
Speaker 5:  rolls saved up in my house. Don't you're going to, you're gonna be upset.

647
00:44:28,835 --> 00:44:32,010
Speaker 5:  Like they're just like in a closet that I need to, to send off for development.

648
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,485
Speaker 5:  No, I get it, man. But it's like cheaper to do it in bulk. Yeah. I was sponsored

649
00:44:35,505 --> 00:44:39,245
Speaker 5:  by a lab in Arizona for, for so many years And I only recently

650
00:44:39,305 --> 00:44:43,085
Speaker 5:  had to bring one roll of film in to get developed and

651
00:44:43,085 --> 00:44:46,645
Speaker 5:  scanned. It's like $25. This is, this is outrageous. Like the, the

652
00:44:46,865 --> 00:44:50,805
Speaker 5:  per price of a photo. Ah, yeah. It's, I can't, I can't do

653
00:44:50,805 --> 00:44:54,765
Speaker 5:  this. It's stupid. And I, I I waste too much money on, on film, but, but

654
00:44:55,835 --> 00:44:59,005
Speaker 5:  this point and shoot game has kind of exploded in the last couple years,

655
00:44:59,445 --> 00:45:02,445
Speaker 5:  specifically because of Fuji film, right? So everyone started coming out

656
00:45:02,595 --> 00:45:05,605
Speaker 5:  with more point and shoot cameras. Digi cam have blown up. There are these

657
00:45:05,605 --> 00:45:09,445
Speaker 5:  like kind of early 2010s cameras that you probably found in

658
00:45:09,445 --> 00:45:12,685
Speaker 5:  your parents' drawer or you would find in like a Goodwill. Those used to

659
00:45:12,685 --> 00:45:16,485
Speaker 5:  go for $5 at the Goodwill. Now they're $300. People are really

660
00:45:16,625 --> 00:45:19,845
Speaker 5:  all about these things, right? So people have been wondering like, when is

661
00:45:19,915 --> 00:45:23,285
Speaker 5:  Sony gonna bring back a point and shoot camera? Because most other companies

662
00:45:23,305 --> 00:45:27,285
Speaker 5:  at this point have brought out their own edition. Actually only

663
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:31,205
Speaker 5:  a couple of months ago, Canon brought out their like G seven I

664
00:45:31,205 --> 00:45:34,885
Speaker 5:  believe it's called, which was sort of a reimagining of an

665
00:45:35,345 --> 00:45:38,365
Speaker 5:  old camera that they had that was pointing to just like Sony is doing now.

666
00:45:39,265 --> 00:45:43,045
Speaker 5:  Anyway, the drama around this is that the X 100 series,

667
00:45:43,045 --> 00:45:46,885
Speaker 5:  even the X 106, the newest one is $1,700,

668
00:45:47,255 --> 00:45:50,445
Speaker 5:  which was already more expensive than the X 105. And people are kind of upset

669
00:45:50,445 --> 00:45:53,565
Speaker 5:  about that. This is the Fuji. The Fuji is 1700. The fu the Fuji is 1700.

670
00:45:53,585 --> 00:45:57,365
Speaker 5:  Yes. On the other end of the spectrum you've got the, like a Q3, which

671
00:45:57,565 --> 00:46:00,525
Speaker 5:  launched at $6,000. Now after the tariff situation, it's like

672
00:46:00,575 --> 00:46:03,605
Speaker 5:  $6,800, almost seven grand.

673
00:46:04,465 --> 00:46:08,445
Speaker 5:  So that's a big price discrepancy, obviously. Yes. The RX one

674
00:46:08,605 --> 00:46:12,365
Speaker 5:  R two from 10 years ago was $3,300,

675
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:16,725
Speaker 5:  which if you look at inflation is about 4,700. To be

676
00:46:16,725 --> 00:46:20,685
Speaker 5:  fair. Oh man. To be fair, yeah. Anyway, this camera, just this new

677
00:46:20,685 --> 00:46:24,365
Speaker 5:  version of this camera, RX one, R Mark three, it just launched

678
00:46:24,845 --> 00:46:28,685
Speaker 5:  yesterday, as you said it was in, is like a stealth launch. The way I

679
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:32,165
Speaker 5:  found out about it was an email press release directly from Sony, which is

680
00:46:32,165 --> 00:46:35,325
Speaker 5:  like, not usually how I find out about cameras. Well, okay, and this is another

681
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:38,725
Speaker 5:  thing that I wanna bring up. It's it, if you're like a, a camera nerd, you

682
00:46:38,925 --> 00:46:42,685
Speaker 5:  probably know that like when a new camera is announced, you go to

683
00:46:42,685 --> 00:46:46,525
Speaker 5:  YouTube and there are dozens of videos. And even though

684
00:46:46,525 --> 00:46:49,165
Speaker 5:  the company's like, here it is, here's a new camera, nobody's heard about

685
00:46:49,165 --> 00:46:52,965
Speaker 5:  it before. A bunch of people have been using it Yeah.

686
00:46:52,985 --> 00:46:56,405
Speaker 5:  For like a month or more. Yeah. Than they've been like flown out to junkets

687
00:46:56,405 --> 00:47:00,045
Speaker 5:  in like Japan and Prague. So like take these gorgeous photos

688
00:47:00,905 --> 00:47:04,605
Speaker 5:  and Sony did none of that. They really did none of that. Which is crazy.

689
00:47:04,605 --> 00:47:07,605
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Because this feels like I, I'm not, I'm not even trying to like knock

690
00:47:07,605 --> 00:47:11,485
Speaker 5:  influencers, like this feels like the kind of camera that would

691
00:47:11,485 --> 00:47:15,045
Speaker 5:  appeal to like a pretty white, like it's an aspirational camera. It's a full

692
00:47:15,045 --> 00:47:18,685
Speaker 5:  frame sensor in a super small body. Yeah. I guess we should talk about the

693
00:47:18,685 --> 00:47:21,205
Speaker 5:  actual camera itself. Yeah, yeah. We just talked about the context. Well

694
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:25,005
Speaker 6:  We haven't mentioned how much it costs yet And I, I really want to

695
00:47:25,005 --> 00:47:25,925
Speaker 6:  understand Yes,

696
00:47:26,305 --> 00:47:27,125
Speaker 5:  Why Yes. Sorry,

697
00:47:27,665 --> 00:47:31,205
Speaker 6:  I'm not a com I'm not a camera girl. I'm sorry. Okay. This is an

698
00:47:31,205 --> 00:47:32,085
Speaker 6:  expensive camera.

699
00:47:33,125 --> 00:47:36,725
Speaker 5:  A lot of other people are also trying to understand why. So I get you. Oh

700
00:47:36,725 --> 00:47:38,885
Speaker 5:  my God, it's $5,100.

701
00:47:41,155 --> 00:47:45,005
Speaker 5:  It's really expensive there, you know, they're like a Q3 is 6,800 now

702
00:47:45,185 --> 00:47:48,925
Speaker 5:  that's also Leica and Leica. Everything is always ridiculously

703
00:47:48,925 --> 00:47:52,765
Speaker 5:  expensive. Fujifilm released the GFX 100 rf, which

704
00:47:52,765 --> 00:47:56,725
Speaker 5:  is 50 or 4,800 and people are saying it was 200. And that's for a medium

705
00:47:56,725 --> 00:47:59,005
Speaker 5:  format. That's medium format, 100 megapixel.

706
00:47:59,105 --> 00:48:02,405
Speaker 6:  Is this technically half? Is that, is it, is it a technical thing? Like they

707
00:48:02,405 --> 00:48:06,285
Speaker 6:  couldn't be cheaper? Or is this aspirational? Well,

708
00:48:06,445 --> 00:48:09,685
Speaker 5:  The thing about Sony is, okay, the thing about the Sony camera is no,

709
00:48:10,435 --> 00:48:13,645
Speaker 5:  that, this is the big question that everyone's wondering about, right? Is

710
00:48:13,645 --> 00:48:17,485
Speaker 5:  that there are all these sort of point and shoot cameras and yes, the q

711
00:48:17,505 --> 00:48:20,445
Speaker 5:  the like a Q3 is like the only other full frame one. And then you get into

712
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:24,325
Speaker 5:  Fuji even with the GFX. But it is very, very

713
00:48:24,325 --> 00:48:28,125
Speaker 5:  weird that this is $5,100 because Sony also offers another camera

714
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:31,965
Speaker 5:  called the A seven CR two, also

715
00:48:32,245 --> 00:48:35,565
Speaker 5:  horrible naming system. Not fixed lens, but also quite small.

716
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:39,925
Speaker 5:  And it is half this price. So that's wild. It is weird.

717
00:48:40,625 --> 00:48:44,565
Speaker 5:  It is physically. Okay, let's talk about this camera. It is 61

718
00:48:44,575 --> 00:48:47,885
Speaker 5:  megapixels because they are always stands for resolution. Currently the A

719
00:48:47,885 --> 00:48:50,885
Speaker 5:  seven R five is 61 megapixels. So using that sensor, they, they're all, aren't

720
00:48:50,885 --> 00:48:54,805
Speaker 5:  they all high resolution now? Well defined high resolution. This is I, oh

721
00:48:54,805 --> 00:48:58,445
Speaker 5:  my god. I know, I know, I know. So it's 61 megapixels has a

722
00:48:58,445 --> 00:49:02,285
Speaker 5:  35 millimeter F two lens, which F two at, on a full frame

723
00:49:02,345 --> 00:49:05,885
Speaker 5:  is actually quite good. You know, that's nice. They like a

724
00:49:05,965 --> 00:49:09,605
Speaker 5:  Q3 is one F1 0.7, so it's a little different, but the lens is way bigger.

725
00:49:10,285 --> 00:49:14,245
Speaker 5:  It has an EVF now, but the EVF is like pretty old. It's like

726
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:17,765
Speaker 5:  a multi-generation old EVF. So people are complaining about that

727
00:49:19,105 --> 00:49:23,005
Speaker 5:  and it does not have a tiltable screen on the

728
00:49:23,005 --> 00:49:26,925
Speaker 5:  back, which is a really big miss in a, a lot of people's

729
00:49:26,925 --> 00:49:29,845
Speaker 5:  opinions, including mine. Because the way that a lot of people use these

730
00:49:29,845 --> 00:49:33,045
Speaker 5:  point and shoot cameras is sort of just like keeping it in their pocket or

731
00:49:33,045 --> 00:49:36,525
Speaker 5:  keeping it on a, on a strap and then just sort of like shooting over their

732
00:49:36,525 --> 00:49:40,365
Speaker 5:  head or you know, putting it down by their waist and

733
00:49:40,365 --> 00:49:43,885
Speaker 5:  kind of flipping up the screen so they can shoot at waist level. But now

734
00:49:43,985 --> 00:49:47,605
Speaker 5:  not being able to have a screen that flips out, you always have to have it

735
00:49:47,605 --> 00:49:51,445
Speaker 5:  up to your eye or you just have to guess. And Sony said that the reason they

736
00:49:51,445 --> 00:49:55,405
Speaker 5:  did this was because of this magnesium alloy body and it's like unibody and

737
00:49:55,685 --> 00:49:59,165
Speaker 5:  whatever. And they wanted to keep it slim, but it just feels like it takes

738
00:49:59,195 --> 00:50:03,025
Speaker 5:  away from the functionality a lot. And the paradox of this camera

739
00:50:03,165 --> 00:50:07,025
Speaker 5:  in general is that Sony is generally about, we

740
00:50:07,025 --> 00:50:10,945
Speaker 5:  wanna slap the latest technology, the fastest readout, the

741
00:50:10,945 --> 00:50:14,505
Speaker 5:  highest resolution on a lens like sensor to lens.

742
00:50:14,765 --> 00:50:18,625
Speaker 5:  That's what it's all about. It's getting the fastest data throughput and

743
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:22,105
Speaker 5:  it's getting the highest resolution. And there you go. And sometimes it can

744
00:50:22,105 --> 00:50:26,065
Speaker 5:  be expensive, like the A seven R five is expensive, but or

745
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:29,925
Speaker 5:  the A seven, the eight, eight a nine mark two, there's too many

746
00:50:29,925 --> 00:50:32,765
Speaker 5:  cameras. Sony has way too many cameras. That's a whole nother, that's whole

747
00:50:32,765 --> 00:50:35,565
Speaker 5:  episode feels like you're reading in code. Yeah. I I I'm sorry if you are

748
00:50:35,745 --> 00:50:38,245
Speaker 5:  not a camera person And I know lot of these Yeah, yeah. If you're not a camera

749
00:50:38,245 --> 00:50:41,205
Speaker 5:  person, this is probably horrible. But people are are just kind of upset

750
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:45,085
Speaker 5:  about this because it takes a lot of last generation features and it sort

751
00:50:45,285 --> 00:50:48,525
Speaker 5:  of does this in the pursuit of

752
00:50:48,915 --> 00:50:52,725
Speaker 5:  compactness, which Antonio on The Verge wrote a very good article

753
00:50:52,725 --> 00:50:56,685
Speaker 5:  about that this morning. About how effectively Sony wanted this to

754
00:50:56,685 --> 00:50:59,965
Speaker 5:  be small so much that they had to give away everything that

755
00:51:00,165 --> 00:51:03,365
Speaker 5:  would've made this possibly more palatable at

756
00:51:03,365 --> 00:51:07,045
Speaker 5:  $5,100. A primary issue is that

757
00:51:07,215 --> 00:51:10,485
Speaker 5:  these cameras are very small and this is even smaller than an X 100,

758
00:51:11,065 --> 00:51:14,445
Speaker 5:  but it doesn't fit in your pocket. Like you still have to have a strap on

759
00:51:14,445 --> 00:51:18,285
Speaker 5:  it and it's still gonna like, sit on your waist sort of on the strap. Maybe

760
00:51:18,285 --> 00:51:22,005
Speaker 5:  you could put it in a large jacket pocket. This is where I'm at with, I,

761
00:51:22,205 --> 00:51:25,805
Speaker 5:  I got an X 106. Yeah. I am one of those people. And

762
00:51:26,145 --> 00:51:29,325
Speaker 5:  the I, the goal for me is to like bring it everywhere. Right? Because like,

763
00:51:29,405 --> 00:51:33,245
Speaker 5:  I would like to take better photos than I can on my phone. Yeah. And

764
00:51:33,845 --> 00:51:36,645
Speaker 5:  I would like to not spend as much as I do on film, but the thing is, it is

765
00:51:36,645 --> 00:51:40,405
Speaker 5:  still like just a touch too big. Right. To be like a, I have this

766
00:51:40,405 --> 00:51:44,125
Speaker 5:  everywhere and I'm not gonna bother people if I'm just like holding this

767
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:47,685
Speaker 5:  up. Yeah. And the Sony gets like a little bit closer. Yeah. But it's, it's

768
00:51:47,685 --> 00:51:51,565
Speaker 5:  still, it's not there. The Rico GR three is what the really use for pocket

769
00:51:51,565 --> 00:51:55,525
Speaker 5:  cameras. Yeah. Yeah. But that doesn't have like the same, I think

770
00:51:55,965 --> 00:51:59,205
Speaker 5:  charm and full experience that these two Right. A hundred percent. The, these,

771
00:51:59,315 --> 00:52:03,245
Speaker 5:  like the Fuji, the Sony, they have viewfinders. Yeah. They,

772
00:52:03,275 --> 00:52:07,165
Speaker 5:  they hold like a regular camera and like admittedly the fact that they

773
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:11,005
Speaker 5:  hold like a regular camera is why they're not pocketable. Right. That is

774
00:52:11,005 --> 00:52:14,685
Speaker 5:  true. There's, there's really nothing else, like quite like this camera,

775
00:52:14,905 --> 00:52:18,885
Speaker 5:  if you want a full frame sense. I mean, I, I guess I

776
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:22,725
Speaker 5:  say that there is the Q3, but, but the Q3 lens is humongous. Q3 lens is

777
00:52:22,845 --> 00:52:23,525
Speaker 5:  humongous. Who

778
00:52:23,525 --> 00:52:27,285
Speaker 6:  Is gonna buy this? Like what is the end result that you're getting from this

779
00:52:27,635 --> 00:52:31,485
Speaker 6:  that you couldn't get other, you know, that you couldn't get from one that's

780
00:52:31,485 --> 00:52:33,445
Speaker 6:  maybe $3,000 cheaper? Yeah,

781
00:52:33,605 --> 00:52:37,565
Speaker 5:  I mean, it is sort of one of those things, I believe where their, their

782
00:52:37,565 --> 00:52:41,525
Speaker 5:  thought process is make it as small as possible with a high resolution sensor.

783
00:52:41,705 --> 00:52:44,525
Speaker 5:  So that if someone doesn't wanna just use their phone all the time, they

784
00:52:44,525 --> 00:52:48,085
Speaker 5:  can keep this in a pocket. They see a moment. It's got a pretty fast lens.

785
00:52:48,115 --> 00:52:52,005
Speaker 5:  It's says ice lens. They're really high quality. Sony usually has good,

786
00:52:52,385 --> 00:52:56,365
Speaker 5:  you know, good image quality and they, they now have these film simulations,

787
00:52:56,425 --> 00:52:59,885
Speaker 5:  but they're not very good, at least based on what I saw.

788
00:53:00,745 --> 00:53:03,565
Speaker 5:  And I don't know, I guess it's for the person. It, it's sort of the same

789
00:53:03,565 --> 00:53:07,245
Speaker 5:  reason Fuji sold the GFX 100 rf, which is again, like

790
00:53:07,245 --> 00:53:11,205
Speaker 5:  $4,700. Their whole market for that they told

791
00:53:11,205 --> 00:53:15,045
Speaker 5:  me directly is a lawyer or a doctor who has too much

792
00:53:15,045 --> 00:53:18,765
Speaker 5:  money and like, just wants to be able to take photos

793
00:53:18,825 --> 00:53:22,325
Speaker 5:  of everyday life. And they just want the best of the best and they don't

794
00:53:22,325 --> 00:53:26,245
Speaker 5:  really care. And for it feels like to me it is the

795
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:30,085
Speaker 5:  same category of person, but they want something that is so small

796
00:53:30,435 --> 00:53:34,365
Speaker 5:  that they could keep it in a jacket pocket or a small bag pocket. Which

797
00:53:34,365 --> 00:53:37,645
Speaker 5:  is true. Yeah. Like it is, you know, it's gonna be a good camera. I think

798
00:53:37,645 --> 00:53:40,725
Speaker 5:  it's just the fact that it's $5,100 that people are like, what is going on

799
00:53:40,725 --> 00:53:41,165
Speaker 5:  here? Yeah.

800
00:53:41,165 --> 00:53:44,645
Speaker 6:  And that the portability, I think that seems like the biggest selling point.

801
00:53:44,765 --> 00:53:48,725
Speaker 6:  I mean, I have, the last time I bought a proper camera was for my

802
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:52,125
Speaker 6:  honeymoon, which was, I'm about to celebrate my 20th wedding

803
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:55,645
Speaker 6:  anniversary. So that tells you how, how out of the market I think.

804
00:53:56,155 --> 00:53:59,725
Speaker 6:  Yeah. But we bought the, you know, the DSLR, it was a, a, a canon

805
00:54:00,105 --> 00:54:03,525
Speaker 6:  and you know, we bought the two lenses, two or three lenses and we were going

806
00:54:03,525 --> 00:54:07,285
Speaker 6:  to Costa Rica. So we wanted to like capture the birds and the monkeys

807
00:54:07,385 --> 00:54:11,085
Speaker 6:  and you know, we had the long lens and the big bag and you know, after

808
00:54:11,085 --> 00:54:14,885
Speaker 6:  the honeymoon we basically never used it because carrying

809
00:54:14,885 --> 00:54:18,765
Speaker 6:  it around, you know, and this was pretty smartphone too.

810
00:54:19,265 --> 00:54:23,085
Speaker 6:  So we had a little point and shoot that we use for everything else. And that,

811
00:54:23,155 --> 00:54:27,085
Speaker 6:  that being able to have a fantastic camera that

812
00:54:27,085 --> 00:54:30,645
Speaker 6:  you could like, frame the photo you have taken and put it on your wall

813
00:54:31,165 --> 00:54:34,765
Speaker 6:  that you can fit in a pocket. I can definitely see the real benefit there.

814
00:54:34,765 --> 00:54:38,165
Speaker 6:  But you can also get really good images out of your smartphone today

815
00:54:38,645 --> 00:54:42,165
Speaker 6:  compared to what you could do, you know, a few dec

816
00:54:42,525 --> 00:54:46,445
Speaker 6:  a couple decades ago. That's, it's a huge difference. But I

817
00:54:46,445 --> 00:54:50,405
Speaker 6:  understand for like the purest having a camera like

818
00:54:50,405 --> 00:54:53,845
Speaker 6:  this, you are gonna come up, you're gonna be able to do so much more with

819
00:54:53,985 --> 00:54:57,925
Speaker 6:  the image that you produce, but are, yeah. Are you actually printing out

820
00:54:57,925 --> 00:55:01,205
Speaker 6:  these photos or are they all just living online and everyone's just seeing

821
00:55:01,205 --> 00:55:02,285
Speaker 6:  them on the screen anyway?

822
00:55:02,915 --> 00:55:06,445
Speaker 5:  This photo's gonna be for the people who are photographer. Yeah. This camera's

823
00:55:06,445 --> 00:55:07,845
Speaker 5:  gonna be for the people who are photographers. Right.

824
00:55:07,995 --> 00:55:09,445
Speaker 6:  It's a pro. It's definitely a pro level.

825
00:55:09,755 --> 00:55:13,565
Speaker 5:  It's definitely a pro. And almost every pro photographer who like

826
00:55:13,565 --> 00:55:17,165
Speaker 5:  shoots weddings or does whatever, will tell you that they have a fun camera

827
00:55:17,165 --> 00:55:20,845
Speaker 5:  that they carry on them because it is small. That is the whole reason that

828
00:55:20,845 --> 00:55:24,325
Speaker 5:  they buy it. Yeah. And this helps bridge that gap between

829
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:28,125
Speaker 5:  fun because it's small and oh, this is like the same specs as my A seven

830
00:55:28,285 --> 00:55:32,165
Speaker 5:  R five with a fast lens on it. It just has that sort of like,

831
00:55:32,275 --> 00:55:35,685
Speaker 5:  okay. But you have to be able to justify that because pro photographers in

832
00:55:35,685 --> 00:55:39,285
Speaker 5:  general are not making below $5,100 money all the time.

833
00:55:40,345 --> 00:55:43,645
Speaker 5:  So, you know, it's, it could be a tariff thing, it could be an inflation

834
00:55:43,655 --> 00:55:47,085
Speaker 5:  thing. It is just surprisingly expensive. Yeah. I mean this is the thing,

835
00:55:47,085 --> 00:55:50,805
Speaker 5:  like I think these cameras are necessarily about trade-offs. Like they're,

836
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:54,725
Speaker 5:  they're saying right, it once you're at a fixed lens Yeah. It you

837
00:55:54,725 --> 00:55:58,685
Speaker 5:  are talking about a camera with trade-offs. Yes. And you are making the

838
00:55:58,685 --> 00:56:02,005
Speaker 5:  trade-offs for the size. Right. And I think it's very difficult when it's

839
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:04,845
Speaker 5:  five grand and doesn't have, you know,

840
00:56:06,275 --> 00:56:09,125
Speaker 5:  IBUs image staple. That is a huge thing. Yeah. No IBUs. And this is pretty

841
00:56:09,315 --> 00:56:13,165
Speaker 5:  wild. Yeah. I, I think that gets really difficult. But like I,

842
00:56:13,285 --> 00:56:15,925
Speaker 5:  I do think there is some level in which like, you sort of have to be okay

843
00:56:15,925 --> 00:56:18,605
Speaker 5:  with it. 'cause you're right, like if you are a pro photographer, this is

844
00:56:18,725 --> 00:56:21,605
Speaker 5:  probably your second camera. Or if I think you're an enthusiast like me,

845
00:56:22,465 --> 00:56:26,205
Speaker 5:  you know, the reason that I pick, you know, an an X

846
00:56:26,205 --> 00:56:30,005
Speaker 5:  100 over any like a Fuji with interchangeable lens is

847
00:56:30,165 --> 00:56:33,965
Speaker 5:  'cause I don't wanna deal with it. Right. Like I just, I've, I've done this

848
00:56:33,965 --> 00:56:37,125
Speaker 5:  before. I've shot Sony before, I've had a bunch of lenses and it's like,

849
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:40,445
Speaker 5:  I gotta choose, I'm not gonna bring multiple lenses with me. Lenses are too

850
00:56:40,545 --> 00:56:44,405
Speaker 5:  big. Okay. I can get a pancake lens, but then this lens isn't what lens

851
00:56:44,525 --> 00:56:44,885
Speaker 5:  I want.

852
00:56:47,245 --> 00:56:51,165
Speaker 5:  I do think like trying to pack it all into as small of

853
00:56:51,165 --> 00:56:54,845
Speaker 5:  a package as you can and make it like a freaking good one too. Right. Like

854
00:56:55,045 --> 00:56:57,485
Speaker 5:  I think, I have no doubts that this, this camera's gonna shoot some great

855
00:56:57,485 --> 00:57:00,565
Speaker 5:  photos. Sure. But absolutely. It, it is true. Like

856
00:57:01,075 --> 00:57:04,525
Speaker 5:  there's a lot of kind of weird trade-offs that they're making here

857
00:57:04,875 --> 00:57:08,845
Speaker 5:  that feel like they're not quite the right ones for the market. Yeah.

858
00:57:08,905 --> 00:57:12,605
Speaker 5:  For the price. And you know, especially when

859
00:57:12,705 --> 00:57:16,605
Speaker 5:  we look around like Right. If you just want something a little bit fun,

860
00:57:17,275 --> 00:57:20,885
Speaker 5:  save four grand to get the X 100. Yeah. And then

861
00:57:21,115 --> 00:57:25,085
Speaker 5:  yeah. Right. Like if you want something splashy, spend a little

862
00:57:25,085 --> 00:57:28,725
Speaker 5:  more get the Q3. Although the Q3, I guess I'm curious, have you shot with

863
00:57:28,725 --> 00:57:32,205
Speaker 5:  a Q3? Yeah, I have. Yeah. I I assume it shoots very different than the Sony.

864
00:57:32,835 --> 00:57:36,525
Speaker 5:  It's a very different type of camera for sure. Even the down to the

865
00:57:36,965 --> 00:57:40,805
Speaker 5:  UX design and the way that the menus work is like very different. Sony

866
00:57:40,805 --> 00:57:44,325
Speaker 5:  is very utilitarian. When, when I've shot with Sony, it has felt like I am

867
00:57:44,325 --> 00:57:47,405
Speaker 5:  like operating a computer. Yes. That's what they are computer and they're

868
00:57:47,525 --> 00:57:50,925
Speaker 5:  computers. It's like not fun. Like yeah, they're very good.

869
00:57:51,305 --> 00:57:55,205
Speaker 5:  But it, it's not like the experience I want. That is Yeah, that is true.

870
00:57:55,285 --> 00:57:58,925
Speaker 5:  I mean I, it's always felt like they've put a sensor and a processor and

871
00:57:58,925 --> 00:58:02,565
Speaker 5:  slapped it to a lens and that's been like what we can do. And Zes, like Zes

872
00:58:02,845 --> 00:58:05,805
Speaker 5:  invented a lot of different lenses like way back in the day. And, and Sony

873
00:58:05,805 --> 00:58:09,445
Speaker 5:  has this strategic partnership with zes. So you're obviously gonna get really

874
00:58:09,445 --> 00:58:12,845
Speaker 5:  good image quality anyway. You know, they have extremely sharp

875
00:58:13,145 --> 00:58:16,765
Speaker 5:  lenses on a really fast computer. And that's

876
00:58:16,765 --> 00:58:20,205
Speaker 5:  generally the thing. It feels weird to be in a world where

877
00:58:20,865 --> 00:58:24,805
Speaker 5:  the Q3 for example, can sort of justify the

878
00:58:24,805 --> 00:58:28,725
Speaker 5:  price now in a weird way. Because all like a gear, right?

879
00:58:29,115 --> 00:58:32,605
Speaker 5:  Sure. It's technically good. They have a good 60 megapixel sensor. Like their

880
00:58:32,805 --> 00:58:36,725
Speaker 5:  lenses are really good. But it's always been like, yes, I know that this

881
00:58:36,725 --> 00:58:40,685
Speaker 5:  is not good value for money. Like I know I get that I'm buying this for the

882
00:58:40,685 --> 00:58:43,805
Speaker 5:  build quality. I'm buying it because it really feels amazing to shoot, I'm

883
00:58:43,805 --> 00:58:47,045
Speaker 5:  buying this because it's like more compact And I like the rangefinder and

884
00:58:47,045 --> 00:58:50,805
Speaker 5:  an M 11 or something like that. But now that the Q3 is

885
00:58:50,835 --> 00:58:54,645
Speaker 5:  like not a ton more than this camera relatively

886
00:58:54,845 --> 00:58:57,965
Speaker 5:  speaking, I, I suppose I love that. I cannot believe Sony made like a look

887
00:58:57,965 --> 00:59:01,845
Speaker 5:  like a good value. Yeah. This is where we're like, that's the thing. That's

888
00:59:01,845 --> 00:59:04,605
Speaker 5:  rough. That's rough. Yeah. That's, and if the Q3 was still $6,000 because

889
00:59:04,605 --> 00:59:07,485
Speaker 5:  that's what it launched at. Oh yeah. It would be like, 'cause the Q3 has

890
00:59:07,755 --> 00:59:11,285
Speaker 5:  IBUs. Right? That's a, that's a huge feature. It's really a big feature.

891
00:59:12,225 --> 00:59:16,085
Speaker 5:  It has a faster F1 0.7 lens. It's got a sum UX lens,

892
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:19,765
Speaker 5:  which those lenses are really amazing. It's got a better interface design.

893
00:59:19,825 --> 00:59:23,605
Speaker 5:  It shoots eight K 30 video. And to think that the Sony

894
00:59:23,705 --> 00:59:27,165
Speaker 5:  shoots a 4K 30 video and to think that

895
00:59:27,685 --> 00:59:31,285
Speaker 5:  a Leica camera shoots better video than a Sony camera,

896
00:59:31,665 --> 00:59:34,645
Speaker 5:  it just completely flips the script on everything so that it almost makes

897
00:59:34,645 --> 00:59:38,605
Speaker 5:  the price cap like more justifiable. Which is weird because the

898
00:59:38,605 --> 00:59:42,085
Speaker 5:  only justifiable thing of Aica used to be the fact that it's aica that's

899
00:59:42,085 --> 00:59:45,085
Speaker 5:  like Yeah. The main thing, it's a fashion device. They are built better.

900
00:59:45,085 --> 00:59:48,845
Speaker 5:  Generally they're, they feel amazing. But you have to really just

901
00:59:48,845 --> 00:59:52,445
Speaker 5:  decide like, I'm gonna go out on this for no reason. So

902
00:59:52,725 --> 00:59:56,685
Speaker 5:  I don't know, like you said, all cameras are good now and this is gonna

903
00:59:56,685 --> 01:00:00,325
Speaker 5:  shoot amazing photos and it is, it's even smaller than an X

904
01:00:00,325 --> 01:00:04,205
Speaker 5:  106, which is kind of crazy 'cause the sensor is way bigger. Yeah.

905
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:09,085
Speaker 5:  But you know, it's 5,100 Fuji, Fuji get on it.

906
01:00:09,085 --> 01:00:12,885
Speaker 5:  Please, please. I mean they sort of did with the rf, right? I mean so you,

907
01:00:12,985 --> 01:00:16,805
Speaker 5:  you reviewed the the I did GFX 100 RF for us.

908
01:00:16,805 --> 01:00:20,725
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Which is Fuji's medium. I'm gonna put air

909
01:00:20,725 --> 01:00:24,685
Speaker 5:  quotes compact, compact, medium for for my camera. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which

910
01:00:24,685 --> 01:00:28,285
Speaker 5:  feels like it's sort of an entire different, like it's, it is, it's the same

911
01:00:28,285 --> 01:00:31,765
Speaker 5:  idea Fuji gear is, but it feels like it's, it's its own world particularly

912
01:00:31,765 --> 01:00:35,005
Speaker 5:  like, 'cause it's it's still because of chunky, right? Yeah. Like it's not

913
01:00:35,105 --> 01:00:39,005
Speaker 5:  for sure. It's certainly not pocketable. Yeah. It's slower than this. But

914
01:00:39,005 --> 01:00:42,365
Speaker 5:  it is like, I, I am curious like what is make, like

915
01:00:42,655 --> 01:00:45,245
Speaker 5:  where does this trend come from? Right. It is because

916
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:49,805
Speaker 5:  there's that in between. That's would normally come right after

917
01:00:49,805 --> 01:00:52,405
Speaker 5:  smartphones is not better than smartphones. Right. And so you need to go

918
01:00:52,625 --> 01:00:56,605
Speaker 5:  all the way to, I'm spending five grand to get

919
01:00:57,195 --> 01:01:00,885
Speaker 5:  this dramatically better photo. It's become the point where either you want

920
01:01:00,885 --> 01:01:04,325
Speaker 5:  something worse than your smartphone, which A lot of people do. Yeah. Because

921
01:01:04,415 --> 01:01:08,245
Speaker 5:  worse is like trendy and feels more real and you know, the Zoomers love it.

922
01:01:08,245 --> 01:01:11,965
Speaker 5:  The alpha, the gen alpha kids love it. So they're buying like the, the

923
01:01:12,115 --> 01:01:15,805
Speaker 5:  digi cams, you know, or you want something that's dramatically better,

924
01:01:16,075 --> 01:01:20,005
Speaker 5:  like you said, like the smartphone is so technically good now. But the thing

925
01:01:20,005 --> 01:01:23,925
Speaker 5:  about the smartphone is that computational photography crushes the highlights

926
01:01:23,945 --> 01:01:27,565
Speaker 5:  and brings up the shadows. The tone curve is flat. Yeah. So the entire image

927
01:01:27,585 --> 01:01:31,485
Speaker 5:  is just gonna be like, everything's in focus and everything is,

928
01:01:31,625 --> 01:01:35,085
Speaker 5:  you can see everything. 'cause there's, there's detail in everything. And

929
01:01:35,085 --> 01:01:38,805
Speaker 5:  while that's like useful for transferring information to

930
01:01:39,065 --> 01:01:42,205
Speaker 5:  one another, it's not that useful in terms of like being an artist.

931
01:01:43,065 --> 01:01:46,925
Speaker 5:  So it's driving me crazy. Yeah. I am really curious when the

932
01:01:46,925 --> 01:01:50,565
Speaker 5:  camera companies are gonna be like, huh, like, maybe we should do something

933
01:01:50,565 --> 01:01:54,005
Speaker 5:  like it. It feels very weird to me. And I wonder if it's just that they just

934
01:01:54,005 --> 01:01:57,685
Speaker 5:  don't have the processing ability or something. But like, I spoke to someone

935
01:01:58,515 --> 01:02:02,445
Speaker 5:  very recently that said there are going to be ISPs that

936
01:02:02,445 --> 01:02:05,445
Speaker 5:  are gonna come to dedicated cameras very soon that have been used in

937
01:02:06,365 --> 01:02:09,605
Speaker 5:  smartphones. So like, it's about to get much faster.

938
01:02:10,725 --> 01:02:13,885
Speaker 5:  I I think there are some potential upsides to this And I think there's a

939
01:02:13,885 --> 01:02:17,485
Speaker 5:  lot of potential downsides, but like, it, the, the power and

940
01:02:17,485 --> 01:02:21,325
Speaker 5:  flexibility of like a smartphone's ISP with the

941
01:02:21,385 --> 01:02:25,125
Speaker 5:  actual capabilities of a great lens and a great sensor would love that.

942
01:02:25,145 --> 01:02:29,045
Speaker 5:  That's coming soon. But I mean that's, I'm I'm surprised it has taken

943
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:32,965
Speaker 5:  this long. Yeah. But yeah, it is true. Like right now it is, it

944
01:02:32,965 --> 01:02:36,405
Speaker 5:  is sort of the worst of both worlds. 'cause we that we have all that power

945
01:02:36,745 --> 01:02:40,325
Speaker 5:  and none of the flexibility. Yeah. Your photo looks, the way it looks

946
01:02:40,745 --> 01:02:44,645
Speaker 5:  and like you can sort of tune it in the iPhone's photo style thing, but

947
01:02:44,645 --> 01:02:48,605
Speaker 5:  like, you know, not everybody's doing that. You have to like set that it

948
01:02:48,605 --> 01:02:51,925
Speaker 5:  is up in advance. I'm not sure it's the convergence of both things. It's

949
01:02:51,925 --> 01:02:55,685
Speaker 5:  sort of like when manufacturers make a computer that's also a tablet and

950
01:02:55,685 --> 01:02:58,485
Speaker 5:  so it's like, cool, this is a tablet, but when I hold it, I feel the keys

951
01:02:58,485 --> 01:03:00,965
Speaker 5:  on the back of it. Right. Right. And that's like, not fun, but if you try

952
01:03:00,965 --> 01:03:04,925
Speaker 5:  to make a iPad a computer, it's also still not quite there. So

953
01:03:05,345 --> 01:03:08,085
Speaker 5:  people want the dedicated things, you know, it's like, I'm just gonna use

954
01:03:08,085 --> 01:03:11,925
Speaker 5:  my phone as a phone. I'm just gonna use my, my camera as a camera.

955
01:03:12,105 --> 01:03:12,445
Speaker 5:  But we

956
01:03:12,445 --> 01:03:16,045
Speaker 6:  Can't do that right now. That's, that's what frustrates me is that we've

957
01:03:16,045 --> 01:03:19,845
Speaker 6:  got phones becoming cameras and cameras becoming phones like

958
01:03:19,865 --> 01:03:22,965
Speaker 6:  the size of a phone. It's like eventually we're gonna end up with everything

959
01:03:23,235 --> 01:03:26,645
Speaker 6:  exactly the same. And like, how do we pick and what's the, because phones

960
01:03:26,705 --> 01:03:30,645
Speaker 6:  are getting bigger in order to be better cameras for the ma

961
01:03:31,205 --> 01:03:34,445
Speaker 6:  Majority of the reason, obviously some people want the bigger screens as

962
01:03:34,445 --> 01:03:38,405
Speaker 6:  well. But I've not done a a plus phone for a long time. I'm still,

963
01:03:38,965 --> 01:03:42,605
Speaker 6:  I like, I I used to do the plus And I was like, this is just too big now.

964
01:03:42,645 --> 01:03:46,445
Speaker 6:  I want a phone to be a phone. I like the idea of a smaller camera.

965
01:03:46,545 --> 01:03:50,085
Speaker 6:  But yeah, that convergence is, is slowly happening. And it's gonna be interesting

966
01:03:50,085 --> 01:03:51,805
Speaker 6:  to see when we are at the same,

967
01:03:53,015 --> 01:03:56,205
Speaker 5:  We're getting close. I mean, a lot of the Chinese phones are getting insane

968
01:03:56,205 --> 01:03:59,325
Speaker 5:  with their image quality. They're they're going up to what, one inch sensors

969
01:03:59,325 --> 01:04:02,805
Speaker 5:  now? Yeah. Like bigger than one inch at this point using glass lenses and

970
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:06,165
Speaker 5:  all this stuff. And attachments of Vivo has this phone now that has like

971
01:04:06,405 --> 01:04:10,365
Speaker 5:  a telephoto lens, like attachment on it. Crazy stuff.

972
01:04:10,665 --> 01:04:14,485
Speaker 5:  So I don't know. We're getting there. It's, it's been a long road, but I

973
01:04:14,485 --> 01:04:17,925
Speaker 5:  don't know. I, there there were some posts about this Sony camera on

974
01:04:18,155 --> 01:04:21,805
Speaker 5:  threads where some influencers, I suppose got

975
01:04:21,805 --> 01:04:25,605
Speaker 5:  access to it like the weekend before. So they're posting like photos

976
01:04:25,675 --> 01:04:29,245
Speaker 5:  from the weekend before. But like you said, there was no grand. Like

977
01:04:29,565 --> 01:04:33,245
Speaker 5:  everyone's got a review out. It seems like they didn't do that. And that

978
01:04:33,245 --> 01:04:37,005
Speaker 5:  is questionable. I'm, I'm curious if it was like a, either

979
01:04:37,025 --> 01:04:40,925
Speaker 5:  was like a sourcing thing or it was like a maybe we don't wanna

980
01:04:40,925 --> 01:04:44,365
Speaker 5:  make a big splash about this 'cause we sort of know that it's really expensive

981
01:04:44,505 --> 01:04:46,485
Speaker 5:  and that people are gonna get yelled, yelled at. Well, the

982
01:04:46,565 --> 01:04:47,565
Speaker 6:  Headline would be comment section.

983
01:04:48,195 --> 01:04:51,525
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Right. The fact that I got it in a press release when they announced

984
01:04:51,525 --> 01:04:54,685
Speaker 5:  it instead of any kind of embargo was like quite interesting. Especially

985
01:04:54,685 --> 01:04:58,605
Speaker 5:  for something that's like so hyped and so like long awaited. Yeah. And

986
01:04:58,605 --> 01:05:02,285
Speaker 5:  like this, this lineup was ahead of the curve and then just sort of disappeared.

987
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:05,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's very strange. I am, I am really curious why? Because

988
01:05:06,605 --> 01:05:09,165
Speaker 5:  honestly, even when I know a camera's like not gonna be amazing or like,

989
01:05:09,165 --> 01:05:11,725
Speaker 5:  it's kind of a weird one. Like those are the videos that like, I actually

990
01:05:11,725 --> 01:05:15,565
Speaker 5:  like want to watch the most. What was the one might have been a Sigma

991
01:05:15,825 --> 01:05:19,445
Speaker 5:  not the like bf not the bf What was the one before that might not have been?

992
01:05:19,445 --> 01:05:22,565
Speaker 5:  Oh, it was like, I feel like it was Blue one, it was a bunch of different

993
01:05:22,565 --> 01:05:22,845
Speaker 5:  colors.

994
01:05:24,865 --> 01:05:28,725
Speaker 5:  The, the weirdly shaped one that uses the phon sensor. Yeah. Yeah. I don't

995
01:05:28,805 --> 01:05:31,445
Speaker 5:  remember the name of it. 'cause just like all cameras, it has a weird string

996
01:05:31,445 --> 01:05:35,365
Speaker 5:  of letters, but Yeah. Right. It's, it's like I, whenever there's

997
01:05:35,365 --> 01:05:39,085
Speaker 5:  a weird high-end camera, like I don't get me wrong. Like I race to watch

998
01:05:39,085 --> 01:05:42,205
Speaker 5:  these things even though I know it's like you've been set up in the perfect

999
01:05:42,205 --> 01:05:45,965
Speaker 5:  environment to take these photos. Yeah. But yeah, it's very

1000
01:05:46,205 --> 01:05:49,485
Speaker 5:  interesting. I am excited to see the first photos of this start to hit the

1001
01:05:49,485 --> 01:05:52,765
Speaker 5:  web because don't get me wrong, even if this thing is a bad deal,

1002
01:05:53,845 --> 01:05:57,725
Speaker 5:  I I'm very envious of it. Yeah. It's a great looking small camera. But yeah,

1003
01:05:57,725 --> 01:06:01,645
Speaker 5:  it's, it's a, a weird mix of features. I think overall you can just

1004
01:06:01,645 --> 01:06:05,605
Speaker 5:  think of it as an A seven R five that's in like a hyper compact body.

1005
01:06:05,635 --> 01:06:08,765
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And you're paying for the fact that they were able to shrink this thing

1006
01:06:08,765 --> 01:06:11,965
Speaker 5:  that you previously had to like, carry around in a bag with you to something

1007
01:06:11,965 --> 01:06:15,005
Speaker 5:  that could potentially fit in a jacket pocket. That's what you're paying

1008
01:06:15,005 --> 01:06:18,845
Speaker 5:  for. I think before I make this purchase, I need to commit myself to

1009
01:06:19,125 --> 01:06:23,005
Speaker 5:  actually carrying my X 106 round Yeah. A little bit more often. Yeah, that's,

1010
01:06:23,005 --> 01:06:24,645
Speaker 5:  I think we can all make that commitment. Oh yeah.

1011
01:06:26,195 --> 01:06:29,245
Speaker 5:  Okay. We've got a lot more to talk about. The Thunder round is coming up

1012
01:06:29,245 --> 01:06:30,085
Speaker 5:  next. Stay

1013
01:06:31,935 --> 01:06:32,285
Speaker 4:  Tuned.

1014
01:09:46,245 --> 01:09:49,425
Speaker 5:  All right, we're back. So I don't know if you guys heard this last week,

1015
01:09:49,645 --> 01:09:53,505
Speaker 5:  but I went on a little bit of a power trip, right? Neli is gone. David's

1016
01:09:53,505 --> 01:09:57,105
Speaker 5:  gone. They can't stop me. I can do whatever I want now. And

1017
01:09:57,505 --> 01:10:01,145
Speaker 5:  I have officially rebranded the lightning round

1018
01:10:01,565 --> 01:10:03,465
Speaker 5:  as the thunder round.

1019
01:10:06,685 --> 01:10:10,465
Speaker 5:  Now we got, I would say a little bit of feedback on this, right?

1020
01:10:10,745 --> 01:10:14,265
Speaker 5:  I got one email saying the Thunder Round was a

1021
01:10:14,265 --> 01:10:17,465
Speaker 5:  branding disaster on the order of changing

1022
01:10:17,945 --> 01:10:20,585
Speaker 5:  HBO Max to Max. Okay.

1023
01:10:20,725 --> 01:10:22,385
Speaker 6:  Wow. All sick burn. Dramatic.

1024
01:10:22,575 --> 01:10:26,505
Speaker 5:  That one, that one stung. I I, I gotta be real with

1025
01:10:26,505 --> 01:10:30,145
Speaker 5:  you nonetheless, I will persevere. The thunder

1026
01:10:30,195 --> 01:10:34,105
Speaker 5:  round is here to stay until Neli or

1027
01:10:34,105 --> 01:10:37,185
Speaker 5:  David stops me, until the investors come back and have you change impact.

1028
01:10:37,205 --> 01:10:40,265
Speaker 5:  Yes. Just like HBO. But listen,

1029
01:10:40,775 --> 01:10:44,225
Speaker 5:  thunder Round is about chaos. As part of this chaos, We will once again be

1030
01:10:44,225 --> 01:10:47,995
Speaker 5:  making some changes. It's new, it's improved. Here's what

1031
01:10:47,995 --> 01:10:51,155
Speaker 5:  we're gonna do. Five stories, five minutes each. Our producer,

1032
01:10:51,225 --> 01:10:55,115
Speaker 5:  Eric Gomez, once again, has been given the power

1033
01:10:55,115 --> 01:10:58,755
Speaker 5:  of Thunder to keep us in check. Oh, he's gonna hit us with some

1034
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:02,715
Speaker 5:  rolling thunder at around 30 seconds when we need to wrap up. And

1035
01:11:02,715 --> 01:11:06,115
Speaker 5:  then if we hit time, the thunder will strike. All right. Okay.

1036
01:11:06,955 --> 01:11:08,965
Speaker 5:  Thunder round, take two. The

1037
01:11:08,965 --> 01:11:12,285
Speaker 6:  Thunder will rumble. Thunder doesn't strike. We're getting into lightning

1038
01:11:12,565 --> 01:11:16,045
Speaker 5:  Thunder. That's right. This is again, we'll, we'll fix it next week. We'll

1039
01:11:16,045 --> 01:11:19,605
Speaker 5:  fix it next week. There's always room for improvement.

1040
01:11:19,825 --> 01:11:23,645
Speaker 5:  Ah, thunder will crack. Thunder crack. Oh crap. Okay.

1041
01:11:23,795 --> 01:11:27,565
Speaker 5:  Okay. Yeah, we've, we've got, you know, again,

1042
01:11:27,565 --> 01:11:30,725
Speaker 5:  these are good notes. These are good notes. Our research team didn't have

1043
01:11:30,725 --> 01:11:34,525
Speaker 5:  that up front. A CDC didn't know that either. They named that song

1044
01:11:34,525 --> 01:11:37,325
Speaker 5:  Thunder Struck, which didn't happen. So there we go.

1045
01:11:38,305 --> 01:11:41,485
Speaker 5:  See. Okay, well I'm gonna add another item onto the Thunder Round and it's

1046
01:11:41,485 --> 01:11:45,405
Speaker 5:  gonna be room for Rooms for Improvement. Okay. Alright, let's

1047
01:11:45,405 --> 01:11:49,285
Speaker 5:  dive into it. Thunder Round story one, I wanna talk about what

1048
01:11:49,445 --> 01:11:52,525
Speaker 5:  happened in the Android world this week where Android

1049
01:11:53,155 --> 01:11:57,125
Speaker 5:  ecosystem President Samir Samat said quote,

1050
01:11:57,295 --> 01:12:00,885
Speaker 5:  we're going to be combining Chrome OS and Android into a single

1051
01:12:01,365 --> 01:12:05,015
Speaker 5:  platform. And this feels like there's a lot to

1052
01:12:05,015 --> 01:12:08,935
Speaker 5:  unpack, right? They have theoretically been

1053
01:12:08,935 --> 01:12:11,895
Speaker 5:  combining Chrome OS and Android for, I don't know,

1054
01:12:12,575 --> 01:12:16,415
Speaker 5:  forever now even mean sprinkling features between the two. Yeah, because

1055
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:20,335
Speaker 5:  you, like, you've already been able to run Android s run

1056
01:12:20,335 --> 01:12:24,095
Speaker 5:  Android apps on Chromes, on Chrome os. Yeah. But the, it like

1057
01:12:24,095 --> 01:12:27,815
Speaker 5:  kind of stalled out. It was never very good. They sort of like forgot about

1058
01:12:27,815 --> 01:12:31,455
Speaker 5:  it, stopped talking about it. I'm not really sure what this means

1059
01:12:31,525 --> 01:12:35,455
Speaker 5:  long term for ChromeOS. Does ChromeOS stick around? Does

1060
01:12:35,455 --> 01:12:38,775
Speaker 5:  Chromes just become Android? Because Android at the same time and they show

1061
01:12:38,775 --> 01:12:42,495
Speaker 5:  this off at IO in the spring. Android's getting a

1062
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:46,375
Speaker 5:  DA desktop mode, right? They're working with Samsung. Samsung has

1063
01:12:46,385 --> 01:12:49,695
Speaker 5:  decks. You just plug it in, you get a desktop. This sort of makes sense,

1064
01:12:49,695 --> 01:12:52,575
Speaker 5:  right? Chrome os if you go back when it came around

1065
01:12:53,445 --> 01:12:57,175
Speaker 5:  Android, there was not a world where Android was going to be a desktop operating

1066
01:12:57,175 --> 01:12:59,695
Speaker 5:  system, right? Google needed a desktop operating system. They needed something

1067
01:12:59,695 --> 01:13:03,055
Speaker 5:  that was kinda light ran on lightweight devices. We also just like did not

1068
01:13:03,205 --> 01:13:06,655
Speaker 5:  have like these arm processors that could run

1069
01:13:07,345 --> 01:13:11,295
Speaker 5:  super powerful desktop applications. Yeah. And

1070
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:15,405
Speaker 5:  now that they've become so powerful, it's like what, what is, what purpose

1071
01:13:15,425 --> 01:13:18,485
Speaker 5:  is Chrome West serving? Right? And I know they're super big in schools,

1072
01:13:19,525 --> 01:13:23,105
Speaker 5:  but I'm, I'm curious if that continues

1073
01:13:23,485 --> 01:13:27,425
Speaker 5:  in this new world. And I'm wondering if, if they are looking out at the trajectory

1074
01:13:27,595 --> 01:13:31,225
Speaker 5:  going, hey, there's not really anywhere further for

1075
01:13:31,225 --> 01:13:34,305
Speaker 5:  Chromes to go. Right? It was a Chrome browser.

1076
01:13:35,355 --> 01:13:38,725
Speaker 5:  It's kind of it. You, you don't need any more than that. Android on the other

1077
01:13:38,725 --> 01:13:42,165
Speaker 5:  hand, it has a Zap ecosystem. It's getting wind doing. You can keep going.

1078
01:13:42,545 --> 01:13:45,125
Speaker 5:  I'm curious, have either of you been Chromebook users? Oh yeah. In the past?

1079
01:13:45,125 --> 01:13:48,805
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Oh absolutely. I've dipped in and out over and over and over again.

1080
01:13:48,875 --> 01:13:52,085
Speaker 5:  Over and, but now that the browser wars have been happening, I've been trying

1081
01:13:52,085 --> 01:13:55,765
Speaker 5:  like every new browser. What, why, why do you bounce off Chrome? Chrome Or

1082
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:58,445
Speaker 5:  wait? Chrome OS or Chrome. Chrome OS Chrome. Yeah. So what makes you bounce

1083
01:13:58,445 --> 01:14:01,885
Speaker 5:  off Chrome os? Well, I'm a photographer.

1084
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:05,365
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Right, right. So that's all you really need to know. I dunno if you

1085
01:14:05,365 --> 01:14:08,885
Speaker 5:  wanna do, although Android is not great for photographers either. It's right.

1086
01:14:09,555 --> 01:14:13,365
Speaker 5:  Well the photo editing ecosystem is not. So Yeah, I,

1087
01:14:13,455 --> 01:14:17,325
Speaker 5:  there are laptop tasks. You know, actually I was at a Chrome OS event

1088
01:14:17,915 --> 01:14:20,445
Speaker 5:  like a month ago, maybe three weeks ago, where they introduced a bunch of

1089
01:14:20,445 --> 01:14:24,365
Speaker 5:  new Chrome AI features and one of the pre presenters, his

1090
01:14:24,365 --> 01:14:28,205
Speaker 5:  thing was, that's a laptop task. Now you can do it on the

1091
01:14:28,205 --> 01:14:32,085
Speaker 5:  Chromebook. That was his whole like motto, the idea. So

1092
01:14:32,085 --> 01:14:36,005
Speaker 5:  they're like new and improved Chrome os it's like a laptop.

1093
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:39,885
Speaker 5:  Well he was saying that's a laptop thing. He was saying, oh I have this task.

1094
01:14:39,895 --> 01:14:43,885
Speaker 5:  Right. That's a laptop thing. Now I can sort of actually do

1095
01:14:43,885 --> 01:14:47,805
Speaker 5:  it with my voice on the laptop, you know? Yeah. This is weird.

1096
01:14:48,155 --> 01:14:51,845
Speaker 5:  It's weird. I, okay, my take on this is that Chrome OS and Android

1097
01:14:52,105 --> 01:14:55,965
Speaker 5:  should never have been different. I, I kind of, it's, it's a good way. Chrome

1098
01:14:56,425 --> 01:15:00,405
Speaker 5:  OS was a good way for Google to sell laptops, right? Yes.

1099
01:15:00,565 --> 01:15:03,965
Speaker 5:  'cause they, they didn't wanna build a whole desktop e system like Mac os,

1100
01:15:04,105 --> 01:15:07,285
Speaker 5:  you know, they didn't wanna compete with Windows. And so they never built

1101
01:15:07,285 --> 01:15:10,685
Speaker 5:  these desktop applications. And in some ways that was like a little bit of

1102
01:15:10,685 --> 01:15:13,965
Speaker 5:  forward thinking. They were thinking of the inter internet computer

1103
01:15:14,505 --> 01:15:17,165
Speaker 5:  way before, you know, the browser company was, because that's what Chrome

1104
01:15:17,225 --> 01:15:20,165
Speaker 5:  OS was supposed to be. It was log into your Google account, you've got everything.

1105
01:15:20,325 --> 01:15:23,925
Speaker 5:  It's right here. That's why it works in schools. That's why it works in libraries,

1106
01:15:23,925 --> 01:15:27,845
Speaker 5:  things like that. It's very smart for them. Now that

1107
01:15:27,845 --> 01:15:31,725
Speaker 5:  you were, like you said, these processors that are in smartphones are so

1108
01:15:31,725 --> 01:15:35,005
Speaker 5:  fast that they can run these applications that are almost having feature

1109
01:15:35,025 --> 01:15:38,805
Speaker 5:  parody with desktop. Like Lightroom for example, Lightroom mobile. It's getting

1110
01:15:38,805 --> 01:15:42,685
Speaker 5:  very close to the same sort of Lightroom classic functionality. So

1111
01:15:42,685 --> 01:15:45,725
Speaker 5:  there are some, you know, photo editing features that okay, okay, I could,

1112
01:15:46,005 --> 01:15:49,805
Speaker 5:  I could use. And so now what they're doing is they're like, okay, well like

1113
01:15:49,805 --> 01:15:52,885
Speaker 5:  why do we have these new platforms? Because over time they've had to be like,

1114
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:56,845
Speaker 5:  well, okay Chrome as just a a just

1115
01:15:56,925 --> 01:16:00,805
Speaker 5:  a computer platform that is just Chrome maybe isn't

1116
01:16:00,805 --> 01:16:04,045
Speaker 5:  the move they bet on this world where everything was in the cloud. Yeah.

1117
01:16:04,225 --> 01:16:08,125
Speaker 5:  But they realized that maybe everyone doesn't want everything to

1118
01:16:08,125 --> 01:16:11,845
Speaker 5:  be in the cloud all the time. So they had to allow you to use Android

1119
01:16:11,845 --> 01:16:15,525
Speaker 5:  apps on your computer. Also, if they wanted to compete with the

1120
01:16:15,555 --> 01:16:18,885
Speaker 5:  ecosystem of the iPhone and the Mac, they had to have some sort of like

1121
01:16:19,675 --> 01:16:23,125
Speaker 5:  file sync between the two devices. Some way to be able to interact with them

1122
01:16:23,325 --> 01:16:26,165
Speaker 5:  together. It's like, oh, well if you could just run the Android app on your

1123
01:16:26,325 --> 01:16:30,165
Speaker 5:  computer and then now you can like push text to your computer. And they

1124
01:16:30,165 --> 01:16:33,205
Speaker 5:  added that, they added all these push notifications that were coming directly

1125
01:16:33,205 --> 01:16:35,765
Speaker 5:  from your computer. There's like syncing between your, your Android phone

1126
01:16:35,765 --> 01:16:39,185
Speaker 5:  and your, and your Chromebook at this point. It just feels like, why

1127
01:16:39,465 --> 01:16:42,985
Speaker 5:  aren't they just the same platform? Well, can I say this? It has

1128
01:16:43,125 --> 01:16:47,105
Speaker 5:  always driven me crazy. 'cause I've, I've had an Android phone as my

1129
01:16:47,105 --> 01:16:50,905
Speaker 5:  main phone for, for a while now. I don't know why

1130
01:16:51,005 --> 01:16:54,585
Speaker 5:  Chrome and Android do not talk to each other, right?

1131
01:16:55,025 --> 01:16:58,785
Speaker 5:  I can't get my Android notifica, I've read, I use a Mac, right? And so

1132
01:16:58,845 --> 01:17:01,665
Speaker 5:  the Android Mac, they don't play super well together.

1133
01:17:02,715 --> 01:17:05,705
Speaker 5:  Right? If I, if I use an iPhone, I would get all my iPhone notifications

1134
01:17:05,705 --> 01:17:09,365
Speaker 5:  on my Mac. That would be delightful. Can't do that with Android. And I would

1135
01:17:09,365 --> 01:17:12,925
Speaker 5:  love, I, I don't understand why they can't push over to Chrome.

1136
01:17:13,285 --> 01:17:17,045
Speaker 5:  I don't understand why there can't be those sort of interactions when Chrome

1137
01:17:17,705 --> 01:17:21,245
Speaker 5:  is already, like it's a pretty beefy app, right? Yeah. Like I don't understand

1138
01:17:21,265 --> 01:17:25,075
Speaker 5:  how much more work they would have to do to link it up with

1139
01:17:25,145 --> 01:17:28,555
Speaker 5:  Android and having have started that integration

1140
01:17:29,135 --> 01:17:32,275
Speaker 5:  way back already. Yeah. It feels like if you're logged into the same Google

1141
01:17:32,275 --> 01:17:35,875
Speaker 5:  account, they should be able to push notifications through your account rather

1142
01:17:35,875 --> 01:17:38,715
Speaker 5:  than through your device. And then you would show up on your Chrome browser

1143
01:17:38,855 --> 01:17:42,435
Speaker 5:  anyway. I don't know. Right. Like gimme the file sync, gimme some sort of

1144
01:17:42,435 --> 01:17:46,315
Speaker 5:  like parody across Yeah. Yeah. Websites and apps. I feel like

1145
01:17:46,315 --> 01:17:48,635
Speaker 5:  there's something more they could do there. And I think it's interesting

1146
01:17:48,635 --> 01:17:52,475
Speaker 5:  that they have just not done that. Yeah. And, and now they're just like

1147
01:17:52,775 --> 01:17:56,675
Speaker 5:  Chrome o s like a couple of years ago they said

1148
01:17:56,675 --> 01:18:00,035
Speaker 5:  that they were moving parts of the Android kernel into Chrome os and it's

1149
01:18:00,035 --> 01:18:03,835
Speaker 5:  like, just make it Android. It's like right. Already have it in tablets.

1150
01:18:03,835 --> 01:18:07,395
Speaker 5:  The Pixel tablet has has Android, you know, that's running Android, not Chrome.

1151
01:18:07,495 --> 01:18:09,715
Speaker 5:  So it's like Pix. Yeah. Come on. Yeah. Right.

1152
01:18:09,895 --> 01:18:13,555
Speaker 6:  The key though is the education. And the thing that makes it so good for

1153
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:17,315
Speaker 6:  education is how simple ChromeOS is. And once you, once you add

1154
01:18:17,335 --> 01:18:20,995
Speaker 6:  in more of a operating system, more of an infrastructure with Android,

1155
01:18:21,375 --> 01:18:25,075
Speaker 6:  it will make it more complicated. Which I think is, you know,

1156
01:18:25,295 --> 01:18:29,035
Speaker 6:  my main experience with Chromebooks is my kids use 'em for school. Although

1157
01:18:29,055 --> 01:18:32,315
Speaker 6:  the first one I bought was when they promised to bring Android apps. I was

1158
01:18:32,315 --> 01:18:36,235
Speaker 6:  like, oh, now this could be more interesting. But it was so,

1159
01:18:36,455 --> 01:18:39,035
Speaker 6:  it was such a poor experience to begin with. And then I never went back.

1160
01:18:39,195 --> 01:18:42,875
Speaker 6:  I don't know if it ever got much better. But yeah, that, that

1161
01:18:42,925 --> 01:18:46,755
Speaker 6:  simplicity is the key really right now. And it's

1162
01:18:46,915 --> 01:18:50,595
Speaker 6:  interesting because on the Mac now, I mean so much is a web app

1163
01:18:50,655 --> 01:18:54,155
Speaker 6:  anyway, it's not that often that you are actually gonna find

1164
01:18:54,805 --> 01:18:58,435
Speaker 6:  other than high-end software that you need for things like photo

1165
01:18:58,435 --> 01:19:02,315
Speaker 6:  editing, you really don't need specific apps.

1166
01:19:02,615 --> 01:19:05,755
Speaker 6:  So it's interesting. I like, I think it makes sense to bring it together,

1167
01:19:06,135 --> 01:19:09,955
Speaker 6:  but I think the key here is gonna be maintaining the simplicity that Chrome

1168
01:19:10,255 --> 01:19:14,235
Speaker 6:  OS has really sold the market on making sure

1169
01:19:14,235 --> 01:19:16,435
Speaker 6:  it doesn't make it complicated like a Windows machine.

1170
01:19:17,115 --> 01:19:20,515
Speaker 5:  I think all these companies have had different ideas of what an app should

1171
01:19:20,515 --> 01:19:23,795
Speaker 5:  be like. Should it be in your browser, Google thinks everything should be

1172
01:19:23,795 --> 01:19:26,595
Speaker 5:  running in your browser. That was the browser company's idea too.

1173
01:19:27,935 --> 01:19:31,795
Speaker 5:  Proton, you know, the whole proton thing was, well everything's sort of

1174
01:19:31,835 --> 01:19:35,475
Speaker 5:  a web app, but we could just put it in a different sort of environment where

1175
01:19:35,475 --> 01:19:39,035
Speaker 5:  it feels native. And that was the whole idea behind that. Because again,

1176
01:19:39,255 --> 01:19:41,755
Speaker 5:  you know, if I'm running a chat app on my laptop, I don't

1177
01:19:44,225 --> 01:19:47,155
Speaker 5:  Wait. Quick, quick reaction. Do you feel good about the future of Chrome

1178
01:19:47,255 --> 01:19:51,155
Speaker 5:  OS now with Android? Yes. No. Sure, sure.

1179
01:19:52,355 --> 01:19:52,595
Speaker 6:  I think

1180
01:19:52,635 --> 01:19:56,395
Speaker 5:  I feel, I think I feel worse. Really? Yeah. Yeah. I feel like

1181
01:19:56,395 --> 01:20:00,195
Speaker 5:  it'll be more native, but Okay. Next up. Wow, Jen,

1182
01:20:00,855 --> 01:20:04,715
Speaker 5:  we last week in the thunder round in our, in our rapid fire when we talked

1183
01:20:04,715 --> 01:20:07,285
Speaker 5:  about how Ikea had this new lamp, I know

1184
01:20:07,345 --> 01:20:10,565
Speaker 6:  That's also a speaker I was screaming at you guys when I listened to. I like

1185
01:20:11,065 --> 01:20:13,085
Speaker 6:  the speaker was not the big news people.

1186
01:20:13,645 --> 01:20:16,925
Speaker 5:  I, it was a pretty, it was a really pretty lamp. I thought the lamp looked

1187
01:20:16,955 --> 01:20:20,845
Speaker 5:  cool. I wanted to talk about the lamp. And honestly, I

1188
01:20:20,845 --> 01:20:24,685
Speaker 5:  don't understand matter well enough. And so now Jen,

1189
01:20:25,075 --> 01:20:27,885
Speaker 5:  okay. Actually the Ikea had some really big matter news. Big matter news

1190
01:20:27,885 --> 01:20:30,325
Speaker 5:  and Thread news. Yes. Yes. Tell me, tell me, tell me matters. Okay,

1191
01:20:30,505 --> 01:20:33,605
Speaker 6:  So I'll tell you why it matters. So

1192
01:20:34,395 --> 01:20:38,245
Speaker 6:  IKEA has launched an entire, or announced that it's launching an

1193
01:20:38,245 --> 01:20:42,085
Speaker 6:  entire new line of smart home products for its stores

1194
01:20:42,395 --> 01:20:45,965
Speaker 6:  that will be based on Thread and use matter.

1195
01:20:46,385 --> 01:20:50,245
Speaker 6:  So Thread is the protocol matter is the connectivity

1196
01:20:50,925 --> 01:20:54,725
Speaker 6:  protocol that it runs over. And as David mentioned earlier, is

1197
01:20:54,725 --> 01:20:58,685
Speaker 6:  the sort of promise to make your smart plug work with everyone. So

1198
01:20:58,825 --> 01:21:02,725
Speaker 6:  the promise of matter is that it works with every platform that's matter

1199
01:21:02,725 --> 01:21:06,445
Speaker 6:  compatible, which are all of them right now. And, and new ones coming along

1200
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:09,685
Speaker 6:  as well. So this is really exciting because Ikea obviously

1201
01:21:10,265 --> 01:21:14,085
Speaker 6:  big name, big mass market name to date matter

1202
01:21:14,185 --> 01:21:18,085
Speaker 6:  has been very niche whilst Apple and Amazon and Google are all involved.

1203
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:22,165
Speaker 6:  For most, most of them, it's a very small segment of

1204
01:21:22,455 --> 01:21:26,205
Speaker 6:  their offering. And it's, this is really pushing

1205
01:21:26,945 --> 01:21:30,845
Speaker 6:  Mathaf into the mainstream because crucially,

1206
01:21:31,025 --> 01:21:34,965
Speaker 6:  as everyone knows, IKEA products are very inexpensive. And

1207
01:21:34,965 --> 01:21:38,925
Speaker 6:  so this is gonna make it so it's easy to buy smart light bulb

1208
01:21:38,925 --> 01:21:42,845
Speaker 6:  that will work with any platform. And that's huge. And the fact

1209
01:21:42,845 --> 01:21:46,805
Speaker 6:  that it's on Thread is really big. 'cause Thread is very much a new

1210
01:21:47,285 --> 01:21:51,165
Speaker 6:  protocol, like about a decade old, which in the protocol space is, is

1211
01:21:51,165 --> 01:21:53,925
Speaker 6:  quite young and, but it's only recently been

1212
01:21:55,155 --> 01:21:59,125
Speaker 6:  seen sort of broadly in the smart home outside of Apple and Google.

1213
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:03,445
Speaker 6:  So they basically ditched ZigBee for Thread. ZigBee is the

1214
01:22:03,445 --> 01:22:07,285
Speaker 6:  foundation of Thread. So it's not a huge leap, but it is a big leap.

1215
01:22:07,905 --> 01:22:11,205
Speaker 6:  And it's gonna be very interesting that they say they're launching over 20

1216
01:22:11,345 --> 01:22:15,285
Speaker 6:  new products in by January. Ikea kind of rolls things out in a

1217
01:22:15,285 --> 01:22:18,805
Speaker 6:  weird way. So we may start seeing things sooner, like light bulbs,

1218
01:22:19,215 --> 01:22:22,805
Speaker 6:  plugs, sensors, some air purifying devices,

1219
01:22:23,265 --> 01:22:27,245
Speaker 6:  10 like temperature, humidity, that kind of stuff. And it's replacing

1220
01:22:27,245 --> 01:22:30,885
Speaker 6:  the entire tra free line, which you may be familiar with if you've ever bought

1221
01:22:31,295 --> 01:22:35,285
Speaker 6:  smart bulbs in Ikea. And then they, they have a

1222
01:22:35,285 --> 01:22:38,565
Speaker 6:  newish hub, which has been out for a couple of years now. And when they launched

1223
01:22:38,585 --> 01:22:42,525
Speaker 6:  it, they promised it would have it, it has a Thread radio in it,

1224
01:22:42,525 --> 01:22:46,365
Speaker 6:  but they hadn't turned it on. This seems to be quite a common theme. So they

1225
01:22:46,365 --> 01:22:50,045
Speaker 6:  announced this last week that they had turned on the Thread radio and they

1226
01:22:50,045 --> 01:22:53,885
Speaker 6:  are now supporting Thread devices and they've turned their hub

1227
01:22:54,195 --> 01:22:57,965
Speaker 6:  into a matter controller, which means

1228
01:22:58,035 --> 01:23:01,605
Speaker 6:  that you can control any smart plug that is matter compatible

1229
01:23:01,915 --> 01:23:05,525
Speaker 6:  with it. So you don't have to use IKEA devices. You can

1230
01:23:05,825 --> 01:23:09,245
Speaker 6:  add any device to this hub that works with matter

1231
01:23:09,805 --> 01:23:13,605
Speaker 6:  that is supported by ikea. And then the flip side, you

1232
01:23:13,605 --> 01:23:17,485
Speaker 6:  don't need the hub anymore to use ikea's products.

1233
01:23:17,485 --> 01:23:20,885
Speaker 6:  So if you go into an IKEA store and pick up a smart bulb and

1234
01:23:21,675 --> 01:23:25,445
Speaker 6:  plug it in, turn it on, you don't have to have a hub

1235
01:23:25,505 --> 01:23:29,445
Speaker 6:  for the more advanced features because it can connect to any matter hub.

1236
01:23:29,465 --> 01:23:33,285
Speaker 6:  So if you have an Apple Home, apple TV Home

1237
01:23:33,425 --> 01:23:37,165
Speaker 6:  Pod or an Amazon Alexa Echo show 15,

1238
01:23:37,825 --> 01:23:41,445
Speaker 6:  it, that can be the hub. So it's just simplifying it. I don't know if anyone's

1239
01:23:41,445 --> 01:23:44,885
Speaker 6:  ever, if if people are familiar what it was, what it was like to use.

1240
01:23:45,505 --> 01:23:49,285
Speaker 5:  Duh. You deserved it after all. I'm sorry I did so well,

1241
01:23:49,305 --> 01:23:53,045
Speaker 5:  all we've done in this, it's didn't do it before, so I know. I can't believe

1242
01:23:53,045 --> 01:23:56,925
Speaker 5:  it made it this long. I I, I tested the trap for a while ago and like

1243
01:23:57,325 --> 01:24:01,085
Speaker 5:  I, I was very skeptical like Ikea making tech products, but they were good.

1244
01:24:01,115 --> 01:24:04,725
Speaker 5:  They were like really solid, cheap, smart gadgets, but a little

1245
01:24:04,725 --> 01:24:08,485
Speaker 6:  Complicated, impressed setup. And that was kind of one of the issues. And

1246
01:24:08,485 --> 01:24:11,925
Speaker 6:  this should make it a little, it should make it easier, but you know, you

1247
01:24:11,925 --> 01:24:14,885
Speaker 6:  don't have, you didn't have to use the hub, but you couldn't have connectivity

1248
01:24:14,885 --> 01:24:18,245
Speaker 6:  outside of the home. So you would own, it was just be in the home little.

1249
01:24:18,275 --> 01:24:22,245
Speaker 6:  They would have the remotes you could use what, what did you buy? What was

1250
01:24:22,245 --> 01:24:22,405
Speaker 6:  your

1251
01:24:23,495 --> 01:24:27,155
Speaker 5:  Oh, I I it was, it was, I I tested the lights at some point. Yeah, yeah.

1252
01:24:27,175 --> 01:24:31,075
Speaker 5:  And, And I don't remem and now I'm on on Hue. So like, which

1253
01:24:31,075 --> 01:24:32,555
Speaker 5:  maybe they're in, I

1254
01:24:32,555 --> 01:24:35,515
Speaker 6:  Don't know. Yeah. So this, this is, you can now. And so they always were

1255
01:24:36,335 --> 01:24:39,755
Speaker 6:  in some ways interoperable because they both use ZigBee and you could add

1256
01:24:39,755 --> 01:24:42,915
Speaker 6:  them to each other's bridges. It was a little complicated, but now it's just

1257
01:24:43,095 --> 01:24:46,995
Speaker 6:  should be a lot more straightforward. And that's, you know, this is the,

1258
01:24:47,095 --> 01:24:50,875
Speaker 6:  has been the promise of matter since it launched all those years, years ago,

1259
01:24:51,585 --> 01:24:55,275
Speaker 6:  that it's gonna make the smart home easier and more accessible. And this

1260
01:24:55,275 --> 01:24:58,595
Speaker 6:  is a big step in that direction. Yeah. Because it's, you know,

1261
01:24:59,025 --> 01:25:02,955
Speaker 6:  mass market on your IKEA shelves, much less expensive than most

1262
01:25:02,955 --> 01:25:06,555
Speaker 6:  products. And a brand name that people recognize and trust. Not just

1263
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:10,155
Speaker 6:  something they're buying off Amazon for like $10 and who knows where it came

1264
01:25:10,155 --> 01:25:10,275
Speaker 6:  from.

1265
01:25:10,945 --> 01:25:13,995
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I think this is a pretty big deal because the best way to get people

1266
01:25:13,995 --> 01:25:17,835
Speaker 5:  to adopt a new protocol and actually get that protocol moving is

1267
01:25:17,835 --> 01:25:20,835
Speaker 5:  to not tell them that they're adopting a new protocol and getting that protocol

1268
01:25:20,835 --> 01:25:24,795
Speaker 5:  moving and having it in the Ikea where people go to

1269
01:25:24,795 --> 01:25:27,675
Speaker 5:  when they're moving, they're like, I'm gonna replace all my furniture, or

1270
01:25:27,675 --> 01:25:30,755
Speaker 5:  I'm moving across the country And I just need to redo everything. Okay, buy

1271
01:25:30,755 --> 01:25:34,195
Speaker 5:  lights. Okay. I want them to be smart Lights, not think about it, go through

1272
01:25:34,195 --> 01:25:37,555
Speaker 5:  the setup of like scanning a QR code. Suddenly they have matter and everything

1273
01:25:37,555 --> 01:25:41,395
Speaker 5:  in their house can be interchange, like inter workable. That is, that

1274
01:25:41,395 --> 01:25:44,995
Speaker 5:  is like very big. Yeah. Right. Like I think that that's pretty huge. So

1275
01:25:45,555 --> 01:25:47,875
Speaker 5:  I don't know. I'm excited that they're doing this. I still have problems

1276
01:25:47,875 --> 01:25:51,835
Speaker 5:  with Matter at my apartment consistently. What, what, what matter

1277
01:25:51,835 --> 01:25:55,275
Speaker 5:  gadgets do you have? So I have, oh gosh, what are they called?

1278
01:25:56,055 --> 01:25:59,795
Speaker 5:  I'm trying to remember the brand. They're smart plugs. And I also have,

1279
01:26:00,915 --> 01:26:04,525
Speaker 5:  I also have Smart Blinds. Oh man. Yeah. And it was the company that

1280
01:26:04,925 --> 01:26:08,565
Speaker 5:  promised first to upgrade to Matter Eve. Yes. I have the Eve Smart

1281
01:26:08,575 --> 01:26:11,445
Speaker 5:  plugs and they're really, really great. And I have the Eve Smart Blinds and

1282
01:26:11,445 --> 01:26:14,325
Speaker 5:  they're really, really great. But every single time I try to upgrade them

1283
01:26:14,325 --> 01:26:17,845
Speaker 5:  to matter. It like crashes the network, it removes them from the network.

1284
01:26:18,105 --> 01:26:21,205
Speaker 5:  And then I have to like reset up everything and it still doesn't work. And

1285
01:26:21,245 --> 01:26:24,365
Speaker 5:  I just go, oh God, I'm gonna go back to Home Kit. Yeah, yeah. Which sucks

1286
01:26:24,365 --> 01:26:25,365
Speaker 5:  because, because

1287
01:26:25,365 --> 01:26:29,285
Speaker 6:  It's Thread That's Thread. Yeah. Eve updated everything from Bluetooth.

1288
01:26:29,525 --> 01:26:33,325
Speaker 6:  I hear you. I hear you. Yeah. Every, yeah, yeah, yeah. Eve updated everything

1289
01:26:33,325 --> 01:26:37,085
Speaker 6:  from Bluetooth to Thread and just as Ikea is moving from ZigBee to Thread

1290
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:40,805
Speaker 6:  and, but Eve was one of the early adopters and they tried, they promised

1291
01:26:40,865 --> 01:26:44,845
Speaker 6:  and, and carried through on firmware updates to their products. But

1292
01:26:44,845 --> 01:26:48,445
Speaker 6:  that's, that is always, you know, a completely changing the

1293
01:26:48,445 --> 01:26:52,325
Speaker 6:  infrastructure of a device can be tricky. And I've had similar issues

1294
01:26:52,325 --> 01:26:56,285
Speaker 6:  totally with that. But yeah, it's, I mean, you were an early adopter

1295
01:26:56,285 --> 01:26:59,845
Speaker 6:  there. And early adopters definitely. Yeah. Feel the pain points. I can it

1296
01:26:59,845 --> 01:27:00,285
Speaker 6:  goes to the pain.

1297
01:27:01,035 --> 01:27:04,165
Speaker 5:  Exactly. If, if you're a brand new homeowner or you're moving to a new home

1298
01:27:04,165 --> 01:27:07,845
Speaker 5:  and you don't have any smart devices yet and you start with Matter, I'm sure

1299
01:27:07,845 --> 01:27:09,565
Speaker 5:  this stuff works like pretty well. Yeah.

1300
01:27:09,585 --> 01:27:13,565
Speaker 6:  And it, it's a great, great point you made about making Thread and

1301
01:27:13,565 --> 01:27:17,365
Speaker 6:  matter mainstream, because actually Ikea did that for ZigBee

1302
01:27:17,365 --> 01:27:20,885
Speaker 6:  like 10 years ago. Yeah. When it started Chad Free. So it'll be interesting

1303
01:27:20,885 --> 01:27:21,205
Speaker 6:  to see.

1304
01:27:21,915 --> 01:27:25,885
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Alright, next up David. Yes. You went to a beeper event.

1305
01:27:26,125 --> 01:27:29,965
Speaker 5:  I did go to a beeper event. Beeper being the chat

1306
01:27:29,985 --> 01:27:33,565
Speaker 5:  app. Yes. That is now owned by Automatic Yes. Yeah, automatic Who also owns

1307
01:27:33,565 --> 01:27:37,365
Speaker 5:  WordPress. There's a lot of WordPress drama this year. Yeah. Also owns

1308
01:27:37,685 --> 01:27:41,605
Speaker 5:  Pocket Cast, my favorite podcast player. Yeah. They, they own

1309
01:27:41,605 --> 01:27:44,005
Speaker 5:  a lot of very interesting difference. They ly own a lot of the internet.

1310
01:27:44,365 --> 01:27:47,365
Speaker 5:  A lot of, oh actually literally like, I mean we're literally Tumblr. Yeah.

1311
01:27:47,565 --> 01:27:50,725
Speaker 5:  Tumblr. Yeah. Tumblr. Yeah. So, So there was a beeper event last night. A

1312
01:27:50,725 --> 01:27:54,605
Speaker 5:  little Context Beeper is a chat app that it, their whole idea of it

1313
01:27:54,625 --> 01:27:57,965
Speaker 5:  is that you can connect all of your different chat apps into one place.

1314
01:27:58,515 --> 01:28:01,685
Speaker 5:  This is sort of a nebulous. If you like it, you like it. If you don't, you

1315
01:28:01,685 --> 01:28:03,525
Speaker 5:  know, this is the dream though, right? It's like you don't have

1316
01:28:03,525 --> 01:28:06,005
Speaker 6:  Potentially it's like matter your messaging apps.

1317
01:28:06,525 --> 01:28:09,645
Speaker 5:  Yeah, yeah. That's sort of the thing where it doesn't always work.

1318
01:28:10,425 --> 01:28:13,205
Speaker 5:  Always like what is happening. I feel a little mixed on it because sometimes

1319
01:28:13,285 --> 01:28:16,285
Speaker 5:  I want to compartmentalize different parts of my life. Like I talk to a lot

1320
01:28:16,285 --> 01:28:19,965
Speaker 5:  of photography people over my Instagram chat And I talk to a lot of Normies

1321
01:28:19,965 --> 01:28:23,885
Speaker 5:  over iMessage. Right. And I talk to a lot of my tech friends over

1322
01:28:23,885 --> 01:28:26,765
Speaker 5:  Telegram. So it's sort of like, you know, it puts 'em all in one place. You

1323
01:28:26,765 --> 01:28:29,805
Speaker 5:  can have little different sections. Anyway, what they're changing here is

1324
01:28:30,435 --> 01:28:34,125
Speaker 5:  Eric Kosky, who is the guy that invented Pebble E

1325
01:28:34,125 --> 01:28:37,725
Speaker 5:  eventually moved on and made this app called Beeper that does this

1326
01:28:38,235 --> 01:28:41,365
Speaker 5:  last year. Famously they figured out how to

1327
01:28:41,635 --> 01:28:45,605
Speaker 5:  basically reverse engineer the iMessage protocol so that beeper mini

1328
01:28:45,605 --> 01:28:49,325
Speaker 5:  their new app that they had for a while worked with iMessage. You can run

1329
01:28:49,325 --> 01:28:53,165
Speaker 5:  iMessage on Android, which was crazy. Apple got real upset about that. They

1330
01:28:53,165 --> 01:28:56,925
Speaker 5:  shut it down. Now it sold to automatic. Eric is no longer at the company.

1331
01:28:56,945 --> 01:29:00,445
Speaker 5:  He is restarting Pebble, which is very fun. Those are starting to ship actually,

1332
01:29:00,445 --> 01:29:04,085
Speaker 5:  which is a whole nother thing. But Beeper had this big launch

1333
01:29:04,155 --> 01:29:07,925
Speaker 5:  last night with Automatic, where they are relaunching it with a couple

1334
01:29:07,985 --> 01:29:11,885
Speaker 5:  of new subscription features. They also changed a lot

1335
01:29:11,885 --> 01:29:15,765
Speaker 5:  of the apps. So a little more context, automatic Al already owned this chat

1336
01:29:15,765 --> 01:29:19,325
Speaker 5:  app called text.com and the idea of

1337
01:29:19,445 --> 01:29:23,245
Speaker 5:  text.com was exactly the same idea as beeper. And so I actually

1338
01:29:23,245 --> 01:29:27,205
Speaker 5:  talked to the CEO of Automatic last night and he told me that

1339
01:29:27,205 --> 01:29:30,845
Speaker 5:  they're using the foundation of text.com with the UX of

1340
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:34,765
Speaker 5:  Beeper. So it is sort of like the best of both worlds in a lot of

1341
01:29:34,765 --> 01:29:38,005
Speaker 5:  ways. Also, if you had a beeper account, it automatically works with the

1342
01:29:38,005 --> 01:29:41,885
Speaker 5:  new beeper. But the, the big thing is they're introducing a

1343
01:29:41,885 --> 01:29:45,485
Speaker 5:  few new features specifically in these subscription models because they need

1344
01:29:45,485 --> 01:29:48,765
Speaker 5:  to figure out how to make money off of beeper. What are they selling? I agree.

1345
01:29:48,765 --> 01:29:52,725
Speaker 5:  Okay. Yeah. So Beeper Plus it's a little expensive. It's 9

1346
01:29:52,725 --> 01:29:56,605
Speaker 5:  99 a month, which is quite of a lot. But you can have three accounts

1347
01:29:57,225 --> 01:30:00,005
Speaker 5:  print. So if you have multiple Instagram accounts. Okay, okay. Okay. You

1348
01:30:00,005 --> 01:30:03,445
Speaker 5:  can have multiple logins on each Instagram account with, so it's like a power

1349
01:30:03,445 --> 01:30:06,525
Speaker 5:  user option? It is. The whole thing is for powered users. Yeah. They have

1350
01:30:06,525 --> 01:30:09,805
Speaker 5:  an incognito mode. So the interesting thing about Incognito, the interesting

1351
01:30:09,805 --> 01:30:13,605
Speaker 5:  thing about Beeper is that even if the platform itself didn't

1352
01:30:13,765 --> 01:30:17,725
Speaker 5:  offer a feature, if Beeper offers the feature, you can do it with the app,

1353
01:30:17,725 --> 01:30:21,245
Speaker 5:  which is quite cool. So Incognito, for example, you can read

1354
01:30:21,245 --> 01:30:24,685
Speaker 5:  messages without people seeing that you've read them if it's forced read

1355
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:28,165
Speaker 5:  receipts. Wow. Wow. Wow. So that's cool because we've all done the thing

1356
01:30:28,165 --> 01:30:31,085
Speaker 5:  where we've just long pressed on the notification. So that didn't technically

1357
01:30:31,085 --> 01:30:34,805
Speaker 5:  open it all the time. Okay. I would pay for that. Well,

1358
01:30:35,195 --> 01:30:39,085
Speaker 5:  yeah, it's great. That's good. It's good. Oh man. Yeah. Okay. They

1359
01:30:39,085 --> 01:30:42,005
Speaker 5:  should have just called it like beat the read receipt subscription. Yeah,

1360
01:30:42,005 --> 01:30:45,325
Speaker 5:  yeah. Yeah. I, I also ha, I also hate red receipts. So

1361
01:30:45,895 --> 01:30:49,805
Speaker 5:  voice note transcriptions. So if the app didn't have voice note transcriptions,

1362
01:30:50,125 --> 01:30:54,085
Speaker 5:  now it does. That's great. It has chat reminders to remind you

1363
01:30:54,085 --> 01:30:57,725
Speaker 5:  to reply to people. I need that. I'm really bad at

1364
01:30:57,725 --> 01:31:01,085
Speaker 5:  replying to people because I'm always busy and then I don't reply to you.

1365
01:31:01,385 --> 01:31:05,325
Speaker 5:  That's bad. It's good for me if I use this. And then there is

1366
01:31:05,515 --> 01:31:09,245
Speaker 5:  send later on every service. So I think like in the last

1367
01:31:09,745 --> 01:31:13,645
Speaker 5:  iOS version, iMessage added this like schedule send feature,

1368
01:31:13,645 --> 01:31:16,205
Speaker 5:  Google Message just has it. And I believe it's favorite feature. I love text.

1369
01:31:16,275 --> 01:31:20,085
Speaker 5:  It's amazing. So much. It's so useful. So useful. Also, if you wanna say

1370
01:31:20,085 --> 01:31:23,805
Speaker 5:  happy birthday, write at midnight to somebody to show you care by automating

1371
01:31:23,845 --> 01:31:27,645
Speaker 5:  a message that would work. And then they have a, you can,

1372
01:31:27,645 --> 01:31:31,165
Speaker 5:  there's a custom map icon thing. It's this That's good. That's, yeah, that's

1373
01:31:31,165 --> 01:31:34,765
Speaker 5:  great. Yeah. That's the plus service. It doesn't end there though Service.

1374
01:31:34,775 --> 01:31:38,525
Speaker 5:  Right. It kind of ends there. Okay. Yeah. What is, wait, but

1375
01:31:38,595 --> 01:31:42,565
Speaker 5:  what is Beeper Plus? Plus plus? Okay. So then there's Plus. Plus. Okay. Plus

1376
01:31:42,565 --> 01:31:46,365
Speaker 5:  plus is for enterprises. Oh, okay. Okay, okay. Okay. So it's not, yeah, it's

1377
01:31:46,365 --> 01:31:49,965
Speaker 5:  sort of this, but like instead of three accounts per network, you can have

1378
01:31:49,965 --> 01:31:53,365
Speaker 5:  unlimited accounts per network. Gotcha. This is like, I'm a social media

1379
01:31:53,365 --> 01:31:57,205
Speaker 5:  manager. Yeah. And I will, I am entering the matrix a hundred percent.

1380
01:31:57,485 --> 01:32:01,165
Speaker 5:  I will chat with everybody who responds to our accounts. Yes. A hundred percent

1381
01:32:01,165 --> 01:32:01,645
Speaker 5:  that, does

1382
01:32:01,645 --> 01:32:03,725
Speaker 6:  It still work with iMessage or did that go away?

1383
01:32:03,985 --> 01:32:06,165
Speaker 5:  No, it does. They, they got long. That's

1384
01:32:06,165 --> 01:32:07,965
Speaker 6:  Completely gone. Like there's no integration

1385
01:32:07,985 --> 01:32:11,725
Speaker 5:  And completely, like you cannot even, yeah, you can't even put your regular

1386
01:32:11,875 --> 01:32:15,845
Speaker 5:  text through. There's Google Chat or there's Google. Google Messages I

1387
01:32:15,845 --> 01:32:18,565
Speaker 5:  believe. Yeah. But there's no iMessage. So I think

1388
01:32:18,635 --> 01:32:20,325
Speaker 6:  It's still worth it. It works with Whatsapp, right?

1389
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:23,685
Speaker 5:  It works with Whatsapp. Yeah. Yeah. Me, I have it right now. Sold me, I'm,

1390
01:32:23,985 --> 01:32:27,325
Speaker 5:  oh, interesting. I, I mean, I'm not trying to be a salesperson, but, well

1391
01:32:27,445 --> 01:32:30,605
Speaker 6:  I have, I have the same thing and like, you know, constantly from different

1392
01:32:30,605 --> 01:32:34,085
Speaker 6:  sources and then I also talking with people in different time zones and it

1393
01:32:34,085 --> 01:32:36,525
Speaker 6:  would just be so nice to have it in one spot. And does it, and it's the same

1394
01:32:36,525 --> 01:32:36,885
Speaker 6:  even Same

1395
01:32:36,885 --> 01:32:37,085
Speaker 5:  Even has

1396
01:32:37,085 --> 01:32:40,045
Speaker 6:  Slack. It has Slack, it has Slack. Which, oh, that might get messy.

1397
01:32:40,795 --> 01:32:43,885
Speaker 5:  It's gonna be messy. I don't want, I don't want Slack. Period. Well, yeah,

1398
01:32:44,715 --> 01:32:47,245
Speaker 5:  yeah, yeah. So you get s

1403
01:33:00,925 --> 01:33:04,805
Speaker 5:  LinkedIn. This is, okay, this is the thing with ER where I feel like you

1404
01:33:04,805 --> 01:33:08,605
Speaker 5:  have to be a very specific type of person. Yeah. Who is either like, I don't

1405
01:33:08,605 --> 01:33:12,165
Speaker 5:  know, like a messaging madman and like just lives in their

1406
01:33:12,295 --> 01:33:16,245
Speaker 5:  inbox. Yeah. Or just like works organizationally that way.

1407
01:33:16,705 --> 01:33:19,405
Speaker 5:  But honestly like putting all those things in there. I understand why you

1408
01:33:19,405 --> 01:33:22,765
Speaker 5:  would want that. And it also sounds like a nightmare. Yeah. I like

1409
01:33:23,265 --> 01:33:27,205
Speaker 5:  get this away from me. Yeah. It does have some quirks, for example on Mac

1410
01:33:27,305 --> 01:33:31,245
Speaker 5:  Os in your little notifications area where you normally get like one

1411
01:33:31,245 --> 01:33:34,965
Speaker 5:  little text or whatever. Every single notification you've got from

1412
01:33:34,975 --> 01:33:38,645
Speaker 5:  every single different chat app shows up as a notification

1413
01:33:38,865 --> 01:33:42,805
Speaker 5:  in your, oh, I'm unsold. It's not good. You can turn them off. You can

1414
01:33:42,805 --> 01:33:46,645
Speaker 5:  turn it off. So turn off once you're fine. Anyway, again, it's for PE

1415
01:33:46,645 --> 01:33:50,485
Speaker 5:  it's for people who are just like truly it's a power user feature.

1416
01:33:50,485 --> 01:33:54,205
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. Hardcore. You gotta be that person. Yeah. Okay, next one up.

1417
01:33:54,745 --> 01:33:58,645
Speaker 5:  Jen, you wanna talk about Google's Nest Aware subscription

1418
01:33:58,645 --> 01:34:01,285
Speaker 5:  prices going up. And this is like a trend, right? There's, there's been a

1419
01:34:01,285 --> 01:34:02,685
Speaker 5:  lot of this. Tell me what's going on. Yeah,

1420
01:34:02,825 --> 01:34:06,485
Speaker 6:  So Google is raising the price of its Nest Aware service. So

1421
01:34:06,595 --> 01:34:10,525
Speaker 6:  this is the service that you subscribe to if you have their

1422
01:34:10,525 --> 01:34:14,405
Speaker 6:  cameras predominantly. So the Google Nest cams or the Google

1423
01:34:14,405 --> 01:34:18,245
Speaker 6:  Nest doorbell. So this enables recorded video up

1424
01:34:18,245 --> 01:34:22,085
Speaker 6:  to 60 days I think it is. And other features such as

1425
01:34:22,285 --> 01:34:25,645
Speaker 6:  familiar faces. So facial recognition, there's a whole bunch of services

1426
01:34:25,675 --> 01:34:29,605
Speaker 6:  that come with Nest Aware. You do get some, I think you get

1427
01:34:29,605 --> 01:34:33,445
Speaker 6:  up to three hours of free cloud storage with, or three video storage

1428
01:34:33,445 --> 01:34:36,805
Speaker 6:  because it's not stored in the cloud. It's stored locally with

1429
01:34:37,155 --> 01:34:41,085
Speaker 6:  your Google Doorbell or your Google Nest camera. But if you want

1430
01:34:41,115 --> 01:34:44,325
Speaker 6:  more, you need to pay and it was $8 a month

1431
01:34:45,825 --> 01:34:49,605
Speaker 6:  or $80 a year and now it's going from $8 a month to

1432
01:34:49,605 --> 01:34:53,405
Speaker 6:  $10 a month or a hundred dollars a year if you pay up front. And that's for

1433
01:34:53,405 --> 01:34:57,085
Speaker 6:  the basic Nesta aware. So the Nesta Aware plus adds

1434
01:34:57,195 --> 01:35:00,925
Speaker 6:  just, it has all the same features as Nesta wear, but you get 60 days of

1435
01:35:00,925 --> 01:35:04,805
Speaker 6:  video history instead of 30 plus 24 7 recording

1436
01:35:04,805 --> 01:35:08,765
Speaker 6:  if that's what you want. So there's extra features in Nesta

1437
01:35:08,765 --> 01:35:12,565
Speaker 6:  Wear Plus and that's now going from $15 a month to $20 a month.

1438
01:35:12,875 --> 01:35:16,725
Speaker 6:  So from $150 a year to $200 a year if

1439
01:35:16,785 --> 01:35:20,485
Speaker 6:  you pay annually. And this is a big jump and

1440
01:35:20,485 --> 01:35:24,245
Speaker 6:  they announced this yesterday with no extra features. Like it's not

1441
01:35:24,505 --> 01:35:28,405
Speaker 6:  like, oh we're adding all of this and we're putting our prices up. It's

1442
01:35:28,825 --> 01:35:32,685
Speaker 6:  just we are putting our prices up. I think the, that the

1443
01:35:32,685 --> 01:35:36,045
Speaker 6:  verbiage that they said was that this was, you know,

1444
01:35:36,545 --> 01:35:40,525
Speaker 6:  around the current sort of atmosphere in, I'm trying to find

1445
01:35:40,525 --> 01:35:41,845
Speaker 6:  the exact wording. Yeah. Do you,

1446
01:35:42,065 --> 01:35:46,005
Speaker 5:  Do you have any like premium camera subscriptions? Currently? I have

1447
01:35:46,075 --> 01:35:47,325
Speaker 5:  them. There's of course,

1448
01:35:47,505 --> 01:35:47,805
Speaker 6:  Of course.

1449
01:35:48,105 --> 01:35:48,605
Speaker 5:  I'm so sorry.

1450
01:35:49,305 --> 01:35:49,685
Speaker 6:  Yes. I know

1451
01:35:50,515 --> 01:35:53,605
Speaker 5:  This is one of the things that like has always, I, I understand right. If

1452
01:35:53,605 --> 01:35:56,805
Speaker 5:  you like, if you need a security camera, which like a lot of small businesses

1453
01:35:56,805 --> 01:36:00,005
Speaker 5:  do, this makes a ton of sense. But like for a homeowner. Yeah. And you have

1454
01:36:00,005 --> 01:36:02,725
Speaker 5:  to keep tacking these on lot of them. You and it keeps pay extra for more.

1455
01:36:02,795 --> 01:36:04,005
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You keep going up is

1456
01:36:04,185 --> 01:36:05,165
Speaker 6:  Is the second time. And like their

1457
01:36:05,165 --> 01:36:05,725
Speaker 5:  Costs are not going up

1458
01:36:05,725 --> 01:36:09,365
Speaker 6:  Either three years, right? Yeah. It had gone up, I think it was 2023, it

1459
01:36:09,365 --> 01:36:12,685
Speaker 6:  went up and you know, if you just have one camera,

1460
01:36:13,475 --> 01:36:17,285
Speaker 6:  like a doorbell camera, it's like this is a lot of money to be paying.

1461
01:36:17,285 --> 01:36:20,885
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And what's happening, that's interesting. And I think this is why we're

1462
01:36:20,885 --> 01:36:24,565
Speaker 6:  seeing the prices go up because Ring went up recently. Arlo is another in

1463
01:36:24,565 --> 01:36:27,485
Speaker 6:  this space that went up recently is they're all adding AI powered features

1464
01:36:27,745 --> 01:36:31,565
Speaker 6:  to their higher tiers subscriptions, things like text

1465
01:36:31,565 --> 01:36:35,365
Speaker 6:  descriptions for alerts. So one of the most annoying thing about having

1466
01:36:35,515 --> 01:36:39,325
Speaker 6:  cameras in your home or around your home is you get a constant stream of

1467
01:36:39,325 --> 01:36:43,125
Speaker 6:  like motion alerts. Or maybe if you have, if you pay for the subscriptions,

1468
01:36:43,125 --> 01:36:46,565
Speaker 6:  you can get like a personal alert or if it's, if it's an animal or a vehicle.

1469
01:36:46,585 --> 01:36:50,485
Speaker 6:  So you'll get a specific, it'll tell you what, what was there. So

1470
01:36:50,485 --> 01:36:54,205
Speaker 6:  you don't have to open the app to see Now with these text descriptions, it'll

1471
01:36:54,445 --> 01:36:58,325
Speaker 6:  actually describe, like it'll tell me, I just set up an Arlo

1472
01:36:58,425 --> 01:37:02,405
Speaker 6:  in my backyard for testing a floodlight and it says a black chicken walked

1473
01:37:02,405 --> 01:37:03,885
Speaker 6:  across the yard. It's a calm

1474
01:37:04,105 --> 01:37:04,685
Speaker 5:  Wow scene.

1475
01:37:05,465 --> 01:37:09,245
Speaker 6:  And there's, it's a ripple of sun in the background. The

1476
01:37:09,245 --> 01:37:12,685
Speaker 5:  Leaves, it needs to get face identification and like tell you which chicken

1477
01:37:12,745 --> 01:37:15,365
Speaker 5:  it is. It used to be like Mary walked across the lawn.

1478
01:37:15,625 --> 01:37:19,245
Speaker 6:  I'm sure we'll get there. But the thing is, I don't know that, I mean it's

1479
01:37:19,245 --> 01:37:22,885
Speaker 6:  useful. I can see in the future there could be some use because if you

1480
01:37:23,225 --> 01:37:27,085
Speaker 6:  AI could kind of filter out and only send you a notification when

1481
01:37:27,085 --> 01:37:29,925
Speaker 6:  there was something you needed to hear about. This is something that Wise

1482
01:37:29,985 --> 01:37:33,925
Speaker 6:  is doing. They have something called the no big deal filter, which

1483
01:37:33,925 --> 01:37:37,725
Speaker 6:  is supposed to, I love that. Take away. Like it, it determines what

1484
01:37:38,305 --> 01:37:42,125
Speaker 6:  you need to know about. So a chicken walking across my yard probably

1485
01:37:42,125 --> 01:37:45,765
Speaker 6:  don't need to know about, but a man with a balaclava maybe send the alert

1486
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:49,525
Speaker 6:  but then you are, you know, so that's what we're seeing happening around

1487
01:37:49,975 --> 01:37:53,405
Speaker 6:  smart security cameras is this extra level of functionality.

1488
01:37:53,825 --> 01:37:56,765
Speaker 6:  But for the majority of people I think who just want to know if there's a

1489
01:37:56,765 --> 01:38:00,685
Speaker 6:  package at their front door, this is, this in continual price

1490
01:38:00,925 --> 01:38:04,525
Speaker 6:  increase is getting pretty hard to stomach. And most of the other

1491
01:38:04,805 --> 01:38:08,205
Speaker 6:  services which are around the same price, so rings, premium services

1492
01:38:08,205 --> 01:38:11,285
Speaker 6:  $20 and Arlo's premium service I think is

1493
01:38:11,285 --> 01:38:15,125
Speaker 6:  29. That includes professional

1494
01:38:15,145 --> 01:38:19,045
Speaker 6:  per month. Well they include professional monitoring. So if you have a

1495
01:38:19,325 --> 01:38:23,045
Speaker 6:  security system as well, the cameras in the security system are bundled,

1496
01:38:23,425 --> 01:38:27,365
Speaker 6:  you can just pay, I think for Arlo it's $10 a month for just a single camera.

1497
01:38:27,705 --> 01:38:28,885
Speaker 6:  But it used to be free.

1498
01:38:30,555 --> 01:38:34,525
Speaker 5:  This is a good thing. My God, if when you bought the camera it was, it

1499
01:38:34,525 --> 01:38:38,445
Speaker 5:  showed you the price for a full year of service. Yeah. Nobody would buy

1500
01:38:38,445 --> 01:38:41,165
Speaker 5:  these things. Right? Yeah. Yeah. 'cause what you're signing up to a hundred

1501
01:38:41,165 --> 01:38:44,605
Speaker 5:  bucks a year on top of the camera price. Yep. You're paying two unbelievable.

1502
01:38:44,715 --> 01:38:48,365
Speaker 5:  Like indefinitely. Right. As long if you, if you want these things to function

1503
01:38:48,385 --> 01:38:52,205
Speaker 5:  to their full stability. Yeah. And there's, there are like a couple of them,

1504
01:38:52,205 --> 01:38:55,525
Speaker 5:  what is it, the blink cameras that I think like do it all locally so

1505
01:38:55,625 --> 01:38:59,565
Speaker 6:  You can Yeah. And well, and Arlo has the option of local recording ring also

1506
01:38:59,565 --> 01:39:03,325
Speaker 6:  has the option of local recording. But Nest does not, there is a minimal

1507
01:39:03,325 --> 01:39:06,485
Speaker 6:  amount of local recording that you get for free. But beyond that you have

1508
01:39:06,485 --> 01:39:10,165
Speaker 6:  to use the cloud. And that's another sort of galling thing. 'cause there

1509
01:39:10,165 --> 01:39:14,085
Speaker 6:  are many now on the market options where you don't have to use a cloud service

1510
01:39:14,185 --> 01:39:18,045
Speaker 6:  at all. You can use a micro SD card or you can record to a hub in your

1511
01:39:18,045 --> 01:39:21,725
Speaker 6:  home. Like Apple's home Kit secure video offers that you do pay

1512
01:39:21,985 --> 01:39:25,725
Speaker 6:  for your cloud storage on your iCloud server. But yeah, it's,

1513
01:39:25,875 --> 01:39:27,805
Speaker 6:  it's just a little crazy.

1514
01:39:28,045 --> 01:39:31,765
Speaker 5:  It's, it is fundamentally not in their interest to make it easy

1515
01:39:31,945 --> 01:39:35,765
Speaker 5:  to do this yourself, to store it locally. Right. Right. Like it's so, so

1516
01:39:35,765 --> 01:39:38,445
Speaker 5:  much easier for them to be like, oh, it's a small amount. It's like, what

1517
01:39:38,445 --> 01:39:40,885
Speaker 5:  are we supposed to do? Yeah. And it's like, oh, what, what you're supposed

1518
01:39:40,885 --> 01:39:44,485
Speaker 5:  to do is make it easy so that I don't have to pay you $200 every single year.

1519
01:39:44,715 --> 01:39:45,005
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1520
01:39:45,435 --> 01:39:48,725
Speaker 6:  Well, And I, they're really pushing these AI features and it's interesting

1521
01:39:48,805 --> 01:39:52,485
Speaker 6:  'cause they're not on the Google Nest cameras yet and they're still

1522
01:39:52,485 --> 01:39:56,245
Speaker 6:  increasing the prices. They've promised them, they're in like a beta in a

1523
01:39:56,245 --> 01:40:00,005
Speaker 6:  public preview. These text descriptions and some other sort of

1524
01:40:00,625 --> 01:40:04,605
Speaker 6:  AI powered search Gemini powered features, but they're not available

1525
01:40:04,825 --> 01:40:08,485
Speaker 6:  yet. So it seems it's such a weird move to increase the prices

1526
01:40:08,705 --> 01:40:12,605
Speaker 6:  now before offering these features to everyone. And honestly, I think

1527
01:40:12,625 --> 01:40:16,525
Speaker 6:  Google is kind of done with Nest. There's my

1528
01:40:16,525 --> 01:40:17,125
Speaker 6:  spicy taste

1529
01:40:18,835 --> 01:40:22,285
Speaker 5:  That that is the, to end on. I, I,

1530
01:40:23,125 --> 01:40:25,645
Speaker 5:  I don't know that you're wrong. I do like the thunder immediately after you

1531
01:40:25,645 --> 01:40:28,885
Speaker 5:  said that. I know it was spooky. Okay, one last story

1532
01:40:29,425 --> 01:40:33,325
Speaker 5:  and it is a big one. This is, we, we saved the, the

1533
01:40:33,465 --> 01:40:36,605
Speaker 5:  finest story. Yes. For the end of the show. I have so many thoughts. David,

1534
01:40:36,795 --> 01:40:40,645
Speaker 5:  over to you. All right. New emoji are coming guys. It's a big

1535
01:40:40,645 --> 01:40:44,485
Speaker 5:  deal. Okay. Every year the emoji subcommittee of the

1536
01:40:44,645 --> 01:40:47,565
Speaker 5:  Unicode Consortium, that's the specific way they wanted me to say it

1537
01:40:49,565 --> 01:40:52,565
Speaker 5:  releases a number of new emoji. Usually it's not that many this time it's

1538
01:40:52,565 --> 01:40:56,485
Speaker 5:  not that many. This time. Kind of weird sometimes. Kind of weird. Last time

1539
01:40:56,485 --> 01:41:00,405
Speaker 5:  we got like a splat emoji that was just like a bunch of slime.

1540
01:41:01,515 --> 01:41:05,445
Speaker 5:  This time we got eight new emoji, I believe. Yeah, about eight. So

1541
01:41:05,445 --> 01:41:08,645
Speaker 5:  we have Apple core, we have ballet dancers

1542
01:41:09,155 --> 01:41:12,725
Speaker 5:  distorted face, which is sort of like, I think this is basically a meme that

1543
01:41:12,725 --> 01:41:16,485
Speaker 5:  they turned into an emoji. It is sort of that like really up close,

1544
01:41:16,485 --> 01:41:20,285
Speaker 5:  super wide angle face with like eyes popping out of the side. It looks like

1545
01:41:20,285 --> 01:41:23,765
Speaker 5:  this. Yeah. It's a, it's like got a bugeye situation going on. Yeah. You

1546
01:41:23,765 --> 01:41:27,605
Speaker 5:  gotta fight cloud, which is basically like in a cartoon when two characters

1547
01:41:27,605 --> 01:41:30,125
Speaker 5:  are fighting and like there's a cloud and there's all those, like things

1548
01:41:30,125 --> 01:41:33,405
Speaker 5:  zipping around it. There's a trombone, very specific.

1549
01:41:34,135 --> 01:41:37,485
Speaker 5:  There is what they call a hairy creature, which is clearly Bigfoot,

1550
01:41:38,845 --> 01:41:42,765
Speaker 5:  a treasure chest and an orca whale. So if you don't know

1551
01:41:42,765 --> 01:41:46,405
Speaker 5:  how this works effectively, every single year the emoji subcommittee of the

1552
01:41:46,605 --> 01:41:50,125
Speaker 5:  Unicode consortium will take all of these proposals for

1553
01:41:50,225 --> 01:41:54,085
Speaker 5:  emojis. And you have to be able to say, this is important because it has

1554
01:41:54,325 --> 01:41:57,325
Speaker 5:  cultural significance across the entire world. People are using this a lot.

1555
01:41:57,545 --> 01:42:00,805
Speaker 5:  You give them Google trends data, you give this them all this information,

1556
01:42:01,025 --> 01:42:03,965
Speaker 5:  and then they vote on whether or not they should actually take in your emoji.

1557
01:42:04,285 --> 01:42:07,645
Speaker 5:  Famously j Peters of The Verge did make two emoji.

1558
01:42:08,225 --> 01:42:11,965
Speaker 5:  He made the waffle emoji. That's huge. Yeah. Huge emoji.

1559
01:42:11,965 --> 01:42:15,125
Speaker 5:  Obviously people are using that all the time. And he also made one other

1560
01:42:15,125 --> 01:42:18,765
Speaker 5:  one. I'm trying to remember. It's a face of some kind. I, these are

1561
01:42:18,765 --> 01:42:22,685
Speaker 5:  important contributions to humanity. They are. If you're getting a, a good,

1562
01:42:22,865 --> 01:42:26,085
Speaker 5:  the yawning face, this is, these are good. Yeah. People use yawn face, but

1563
01:42:26,085 --> 01:42:28,365
Speaker 5:  there are some weak years. There are some weak years. Oh, yeah. And, and

1564
01:42:28,365 --> 01:42:31,565
Speaker 5:  it's like you, you guys, yeah. There are some really, you went to the drawing

1565
01:42:31,565 --> 01:42:34,205
Speaker 5:  board and this is what you came up with. There are some very weak years.

1566
01:42:34,425 --> 01:42:38,245
Speaker 5:  And I would say that maybe the orca whale or the,

1567
01:42:38,425 --> 01:42:41,805
Speaker 5:  the fight cloud, maybe in this cloud, kind of like the fight cloud. I, I

1568
01:42:41,805 --> 01:42:45,445
Speaker 5:  feel like I'm gonna say this is like, I don't know if this is

1569
01:42:45,665 --> 01:42:49,605
Speaker 5:  an a plus release, but like this is a solid, this is like one of the,

1570
01:42:49,605 --> 01:42:53,245
Speaker 5:  it's solid top tiers. Right? You threw this in the middle. I, I don't know

1571
01:42:53,245 --> 01:42:56,245
Speaker 5:  how you didn't like make a point. They, they have one called,

1572
01:42:57,075 --> 01:43:00,165
Speaker 5:  they have, they have named it hairy creature. Yeah. Which is bizarre. Yeah.

1573
01:43:00,185 --> 01:43:04,045
Speaker 5:  It is Bigfoot. It is Bigfoot. It is Bigfoot walking and glancing

1574
01:43:04,045 --> 01:43:07,805
Speaker 5:  at the camera. It's the famous like fake photo. It's the famous photos. Yes.

1575
01:43:07,995 --> 01:43:11,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's, that is I That's true. That's pretty amazing. Am astonished

1576
01:43:11,955 --> 01:43:15,565
Speaker 5:  that the grand committee of the Unicode consortium. Yeah.

1577
01:43:15,675 --> 01:43:18,685
Speaker 5:  When you know what we need to make sure that the entire world has access

1578
01:43:18,685 --> 01:43:22,445
Speaker 5:  to That's a big foot. Big foot Bigfoot emoji emoji. That's true. I love it.

1579
01:43:22,445 --> 01:43:26,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That's that alone. The rest of these could have been total losers.

1580
01:43:26,325 --> 01:43:29,845
Speaker 5:  Trombone. Makes sense. Trombone. I assume they have trumpet. They should

1581
01:43:29,845 --> 01:43:32,725
Speaker 5:  have trombone. They should have everything that could be in a ska band. Should

1582
01:43:32,725 --> 01:43:36,525
Speaker 5:  be, yes. Yeah. If they had done that as one pack, the ska year,

1583
01:43:36,725 --> 01:43:40,485
Speaker 5:  a ska band, they really, yeah. Yeah. They just start branding it a little

1584
01:43:40,485 --> 01:43:44,325
Speaker 5:  bit more. Right. Like why isn't, there's pirate hats to go with this treasure

1585
01:43:44,325 --> 01:43:48,205
Speaker 5:  chest. They should do themes. Yeah. I, yeah. I will say, I am wondering,

1586
01:43:48,445 --> 01:43:51,325
Speaker 5:  'cause Apple, you know, they have a seat on the Unicode consortium. Yeah.

1587
01:43:51,875 --> 01:43:55,365
Speaker 5:  They must have had some strong opinions about this Apple core. Mm. This is

1588
01:43:55,365 --> 01:43:59,005
Speaker 5:  an apple that has been bitten down to the core. That is Ooh, that's that's

1589
01:43:59,005 --> 01:44:02,685
Speaker 5:  true. There's, I like, that's not good for them. I bet Google submitted that.

1590
01:44:02,685 --> 01:44:06,005
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Probably submitted that. That is quite funny. There's, yeah, apple

1591
01:44:06,005 --> 01:44:09,525
Speaker 5:  core is kind of strange. Like I understand there being an apple. Yeah. But

1592
01:44:09,605 --> 01:44:13,365
Speaker 5:  why the core weird. I will say a couple of years

1593
01:44:13,385 --> 01:44:17,285
Speaker 5:  ago I interviewed the inventor of Emoji Shika Taaka Carita, and

1594
01:44:17,465 --> 01:44:21,325
Speaker 5:  he told me that he thinks that there are too many emoji. It is getting a

1595
01:44:21,325 --> 01:44:24,685
Speaker 5:  little outta hand, I'm not gonna lie. It's getting a little crazy. I do think

1596
01:44:24,685 --> 01:44:28,325
Speaker 5:  the ballet dancer makes sense because they already have like a disco dancer

1597
01:44:28,705 --> 01:44:32,605
Speaker 5:  and they need other types of dance. So that makes sense. But there also

1598
01:44:32,695 --> 01:44:36,045
Speaker 5:  opens up this whole other question, which honestly I just might write something

1599
01:44:36,045 --> 01:44:39,805
Speaker 5:  on or make a video on or something about what we do now that you can just

1600
01:44:40,045 --> 01:44:43,405
Speaker 5:  generate like any emoji you want. Hmm. Right. Like the fact that there's

1601
01:44:43,405 --> 01:44:47,285
Speaker 5:  a trombone or an orca whale. If these didn't exist, you could make

1602
01:44:47,285 --> 01:44:51,045
Speaker 5:  this with Gen Moji in like half a second. That's true, that's true. So

1603
01:44:51,065 --> 01:44:54,805
Speaker 5:  it becomes this giant question. The main thing is these are coded into

1604
01:44:55,045 --> 01:44:58,565
Speaker 5:  Unicode, so they're standardized, so they're gonna work on any computer that

1605
01:44:58,565 --> 01:45:02,365
Speaker 5:  supports Unicode. I am, I'm very torn on the too many emoji

1606
01:45:02,365 --> 01:45:05,605
Speaker 5:  versus not enough emoji argument. Yeah, because, because like, like

1607
01:45:05,605 --> 01:45:09,565
Speaker 5:  fundamentally Yeah, you cannot, there's way too many emoji. Yeah. It's,

1608
01:45:09,565 --> 01:45:13,485
Speaker 5:  it's outrageous. On the other hand, so we use Slack at work

1609
01:45:13,485 --> 01:45:17,125
Speaker 5:  and we have a zillion custom emoji. Yeah. And there's some, I don't realize

1610
01:45:17,125 --> 01:45:21,045
Speaker 5:  they're not official ones. So then I'll go to like, you know, just send a

1611
01:45:21,045 --> 01:45:24,045
Speaker 5:  normal text message and then I'm like, why isn't this in here? Yeah. Yeah.

1612
01:45:24,045 --> 01:45:27,445
Speaker 5:  That's, how did they mis a really obvious one. That's true. It's outrageous.

1613
01:45:27,785 --> 01:45:31,045
Speaker 5:  And I think particularly like there was a time before they figured out how

1614
01:45:31,045 --> 01:45:35,005
Speaker 5:  to do like, big search for emoji. Yeah. Now that

1615
01:45:35,065 --> 01:45:38,405
Speaker 5:  you can type it in, it's like, yeah, I will say I feel terrible. Right. If

1616
01:45:38,405 --> 01:45:42,325
Speaker 5:  you're starting up, you know, I, I mean, I don't know who is in this

1617
01:45:42,485 --> 01:45:45,405
Speaker 5:  position, but if you're starting up an app and you want to have your own

1618
01:45:45,405 --> 01:45:49,005
Speaker 5:  presentation of the emoji, oh boy, that's an uphill battle. Now

1619
01:45:49,265 --> 01:45:52,765
Speaker 5:  you got a lot of little things to draw. Yeah. You can use, you should just

1620
01:45:52,765 --> 01:45:56,645
Speaker 5:  use the platform. Yeah. Twitter famously has its own emoji for some

1621
01:45:56,645 --> 01:45:59,845
Speaker 5:  reason, but usually it's just Google slash Android, apple,

1622
01:46:00,405 --> 01:46:04,285
Speaker 5:  Microsoft, or like the main ones. And you can de as a app developer, you

1623
01:46:04,285 --> 01:46:07,325
Speaker 5:  can default to system emoji and you should, because if you wanna make your

1624
01:46:07,325 --> 01:46:11,085
Speaker 5:  own emoji, you can, but you gotta, you gotta draw every single one.

1625
01:46:11,425 --> 01:46:14,845
Speaker 5:  So Yes. But if, you know, if you only have to make an eight new ones a year,

1626
01:46:15,205 --> 01:46:17,605
Speaker 5:  that's very manageable. Yeah. If you've already made the other like, you

1627
01:46:17,605 --> 01:46:21,085
Speaker 5:  know, I don't even know how many there are. You gotta choose wisely. You

1628
01:46:21,085 --> 01:46:25,005
Speaker 5:  gotta choose wisely. And you know, I, these are, these are pretty good. I

1629
01:46:25,005 --> 01:46:28,285
Speaker 5:  don't know. I, I think I would've cut the whale, the orca, the, I don't wanna

1630
01:46:28,285 --> 01:46:31,285
Speaker 5:  be, I don't wanna be rude, but like, I wanna cut. I'm not using the orca.

1631
01:46:31,555 --> 01:46:33,885
Speaker 5:  It's a cute orca. Whatcha are you gonna use Big foot Smiling, please tell

1632
01:46:33,885 --> 01:46:36,765
Speaker 5:  me. We're gonna use Bigfoot foot. I am telling you this Bigfoot is going

1633
01:46:36,765 --> 01:46:40,365
Speaker 5:  to, is there like an emoji ranking chart? Yes. It's going to actually, it's

1634
01:46:40,365 --> 01:46:43,645
Speaker 5:  gonna be at top Top. It's actually, it is, this is part of that news kind

1635
01:46:43,645 --> 01:46:47,565
Speaker 5:  of because world emoji day was this week and as part of world emoji day,

1636
01:46:47,565 --> 01:46:51,125
Speaker 5:  they brought back the emoji ranking chart because they used to have a world

1637
01:46:51,125 --> 01:46:55,045
Speaker 5:  emoji ranking chart that used Twitter as its database of like how much people

1638
01:46:55,045 --> 01:46:58,965
Speaker 5:  were using emojis. But then Elon cut off the API so now

1639
01:46:58,965 --> 01:47:02,605
Speaker 5:  they were able to bring it back as of this week. So I am excited.

1640
01:47:02,865 --> 01:47:06,845
Speaker 5:  See, I'm telling you. Okay, listen, one year from today, this

1641
01:47:06,845 --> 01:47:10,285
Speaker 5:  is my prediction. Yeah. Bigfoot's gonna be in the top 10. It's,

1642
01:47:11,625 --> 01:47:13,085
Speaker 5:  I'm sending a calendar anytime,

1643
01:47:13,425 --> 01:47:13,645
Speaker 6:  Any,

1644
01:47:13,715 --> 01:47:17,085
Speaker 5:  This is, I think it's gonna ebb and flow as government conspiracies come

1645
01:47:17,085 --> 01:47:20,965
Speaker 5:  and go. Oh. Oh boy. I think there's a lot of room for Bigfoot,

1646
01:47:20,965 --> 01:47:23,645
Speaker 5:  right? There is a UFO emoji. So I guess there should be a Bigfoot. Yeah,

1647
01:47:23,765 --> 01:47:26,565
Speaker 5:  I think there Bigfoot's. Yeah. But then you need like a Loch Next Monster

1648
01:47:26,755 --> 01:47:30,685
Speaker 5:  Lock. I get, this is what I need to do. Themes. Every urban legends

1649
01:47:30,725 --> 01:47:33,925
Speaker 5:  a monsters year. Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh man. Yeah, that'd be funny. We,

1650
01:47:33,925 --> 01:47:37,645
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I'm very excited by distorted face. I have to say, I think distorted

1651
01:47:37,645 --> 01:47:40,685
Speaker 6:  face with the eyebrows leaving its head, I I'm gonna be using that one a

1652
01:47:40,685 --> 01:47:40,885
Speaker 6:  lot.

1653
01:47:43,665 --> 01:47:47,605
Speaker 6:  And the, the fight cloud pretty fun. But yeah, I agree

1654
01:47:47,605 --> 01:47:51,525
Speaker 6:  with Jake that Bigfoot really is the, is the shining star

1655
01:47:51,545 --> 01:47:55,165
Speaker 6:  of this. I, I wanna know how we can get, like, I'm not very

1656
01:47:55,945 --> 01:47:59,605
Speaker 6:  up on the emoji world because you know, it is how my children communicate

1657
01:47:59,605 --> 01:48:02,125
Speaker 6:  with me. But how do these get chosen?

1658
01:48:03,555 --> 01:48:06,045
Speaker 6:  Like I, can I submit some suggestions? Please.

1659
01:48:06,515 --> 01:48:10,005
Speaker 5:  Yeah, you can. You actually can. Oh, good. Yeah, you can do it yourself.

1660
01:48:10,005 --> 01:48:13,165
Speaker 5:  You actually literally talked to Jay, like he, he's, yeah,

1661
01:48:13,995 --> 01:48:17,365
Speaker 5:  yeah, yeah. It's, it's a process. You, it's quite a process. You need to,

1662
01:48:17,365 --> 01:48:20,485
Speaker 5:  it is really funny. Like the nuclear conserv, it sounds, it's like this formal

1663
01:48:20,875 --> 01:48:24,845
Speaker 5:  body. Yeah. It is the most like religious esco body in,

1664
01:48:24,905 --> 01:48:28,885
Speaker 5:  in all of technology. It is. You know, these counselors from

1665
01:48:28,885 --> 01:48:31,885
Speaker 5:  all the companies. Yeah. I technically am part of it. 'cause I pay $75 a

1666
01:48:31,885 --> 01:48:32,525
Speaker 5:  year. Oh,

1667
01:48:32,525 --> 01:48:34,925
Speaker 6:  Right. So you are the guy we should talk to. But

1668
01:48:35,045 --> 01:48:35,765
Speaker 5:  I don't know about that. As

1669
01:48:35,765 --> 01:48:39,205
Speaker 6:  Someone who has, you know, built a career on writing words, I have always

1670
01:48:39,525 --> 01:48:43,405
Speaker 6:  slightly shied away from using emojis, but I have to learn how to

1671
01:48:43,725 --> 01:48:47,485
Speaker 6:  communicate with my, with the youth. So I'm getting there. My mom who is

1672
01:48:47,585 --> 01:48:51,205
Speaker 6:  80, like all of her text messages are basically emojis now. So

1673
01:48:51,675 --> 01:48:55,565
Speaker 6:  it's not a generational thing. I think it's a writer thing. I like to use

1674
01:48:55,585 --> 01:48:56,045
Speaker 6:  the words,

1675
01:48:57,505 --> 01:48:59,925
Speaker 5:  But I, I like find a few And I just like key in on them.

1676
01:49:00,015 --> 01:49:02,805
Speaker 6:  Right. Yeah. That's probably what I would say. I, and that's what I like

1677
01:49:02,805 --> 01:49:06,725
Speaker 6:  about the, the distorted face. I feel like I could use that a lot. Yeah,
