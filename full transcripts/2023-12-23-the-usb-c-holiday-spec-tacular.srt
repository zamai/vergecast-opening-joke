Description: The Verge’s Nilay Patel, David Pierce, and Alex Cranz start the final show of 2023 with some chat about the state of USB-C: the ups and downs of charging gadgets, the ubiquity of one cable, and what the future looks like for gadgets with ports.
The crew competes in a few rounds of USB-C Price is Right, a game we completely made up to show how confusing USB-C and its specs can be. Nilay, David, and Alex each play for a Vergecast listener to win an awesome Verge swag basket from our merch store. Check out the video version of the game below.
David and Nilay end the holiday show with Noah Dentzel, the CEO and co-founder of Nomad Goods, to talk about how USB-C on the iPhone has changed his business, the challenges of building cables, and what tech accessories he’s most excited about in 2024.
Have a happy, safe, and fast-charging holiday. We’ll see you in 2024!

Speaker 5:  IPhone 15 Pro also has the new USB C connector.

3
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:49,605
Speaker 6:  Happy holidays everyone. And Welcome, To. The, Vergecast, holiday

4
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:54,125
Speaker 6:  spectacular. The flagship podcast of symmetrical serial

00:01:54,265 --> 00:01:56,205
Speaker 6:  bus connectors and holiday spirit.

6
00:01:56,645 --> 00:01:58,605
Speaker 7:  I love it. The two most important things in life,

7
00:01:58,745 --> 00:02:02,565
Speaker 6:  Easily. The two most important. And putting booze in the drinks

8
00:02:03,325 --> 00:02:06,125
Speaker 6:  a critical part of the holiday experience that is under remarked upon.

9
00:02:06,485 --> 00:02:07,965
Speaker 8:  I mean, that's my favorite specs.

10
00:02:08,155 --> 00:02:11,365
Speaker 6:  Yeah, everyone's like, you're gonna drink a thing called eggnog and you're

11
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:14,885
Speaker 6:  like, put some brandy in it and we'll talk. Here's a hot cocoa

12
00:02:15,305 --> 00:02:19,085
Speaker 6:  little whiskey. Yeah. Holiday party is getting lit at the USB

13
00:02:19,285 --> 00:02:22,805
Speaker 6:  CIF. Anyway, this is a holiday spectacular our, our now

14
00:02:22,905 --> 00:02:26,885
Speaker 6:  yearly tradition where we dive deep on one specification that makes

15
00:02:26,885 --> 00:02:30,765
Speaker 6:  the entire tech industry go. I'm your friend. Neli. David.

16
00:02:30,765 --> 00:02:31,485
Speaker 6:  Pierce is here.

17
00:02:31,895 --> 00:02:35,445
Speaker 7:  Hello. Are we all eggnog people? We should talk about this. We can intro

18
00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:37,885
Speaker 7:  everybody, but I do wanna talk about if we're eggnog people.

19
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,485
Speaker 6:  I think I've had eggnog once.

20
00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:40,565
Speaker 8:  Oh, that's good.

21
00:02:40,865 --> 00:02:43,805
Speaker 6:  But like the, the real stuff. The stuff that comes out of like a jug from

22
00:02:43,805 --> 00:02:44,725
Speaker 6:  the grocery store. I'm just not

23
00:02:45,115 --> 00:02:48,885
Speaker 7:  Yeah, that's fair. Like don don't know how good eggnog is made,

24
00:02:49,265 --> 00:02:50,285
Speaker 7:  but it exists.

25
00:02:50,745 --> 00:02:53,845
Speaker 8:  You have to like whip the eggs. I did it once and it was too rich.

26
00:02:54,645 --> 00:02:58,405
Speaker 8:  I was like, oh, it's like a, it's like a pudding base. I just drank filled

27
00:02:58,405 --> 00:02:59,045
Speaker 8:  with alcohol

28
00:02:59,355 --> 00:03:02,375
Speaker 6:  All. right. And that pudding enthusiast, that's Alex Cranz that you're hearing

29
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:02,975
Speaker 6:  from right there.

30
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:07,135
Speaker 8:  I'm your friend who loves pudding in all its forms. Set and onset

31
00:03:07,415 --> 00:03:07,735
Speaker 8:  apparently.

32
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:12,175
Speaker 6:  So this is the holiday spectacular A now yearly tradition, which is one of

33
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:15,775
Speaker 6:  my favorite things we do here on The. Vergecast. A chance to let go of the

34
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:19,695
Speaker 6:  new cycle and be gigantic nerds about one

35
00:03:19,695 --> 00:03:23,295
Speaker 6:  interconnect or standard that we all depend on. Two years ago we did

36
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:27,095
Speaker 6:  HDMI, which was really fun. Last year we did Bluetooth,

37
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:31,615
Speaker 6:  which is Bluetooth this year by what I can only describe

38
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:34,975
Speaker 6:  as popular demand. We're doing USB C.

39
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:38,375
Speaker 6:  We're gonna have a little talk about the state of USB C to open things up.

40
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:42,215
Speaker 6:  Set the floor. Andrew has forced us to play a game

41
00:03:42,215 --> 00:03:46,015
Speaker 6:  show. The USB C Price is Right. We did it. I'm not gonna say

42
00:03:46,255 --> 00:03:49,455
Speaker 6:  anything else about it. I don't want to tip your hand on who won or lost,

43
00:03:50,115 --> 00:03:53,735
Speaker 6:  but we did it and it is actually hilarious. It's really fun. And then lastly,

44
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:57,215
Speaker 6:  we're gonna talk to Noah Dentzel, who is the co-founder and CEO of

45
00:03:57,385 --> 00:04:01,255
Speaker 6:  Nomad Goods an accessory company. They make a lot of USB C products.

46
00:04:01,405 --> 00:04:05,335
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Nomad makes like fancy accessories, I would say. And Noah was a

47
00:04:05,335 --> 00:04:09,055
Speaker 7:  good hang. He is kind of eyes open in ways I didn't necessarily

48
00:04:09,055 --> 00:04:12,615
Speaker 7:  expect about the weirdness of USB C, but it is also like

49
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:17,095
Speaker 7:  psyched about the future of gadget accessories in a way that felt very right

50
00:04:17,095 --> 00:04:18,015
Speaker 7:  for the holiday. Spectacular.

51
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:21,975
Speaker 6:  Very right for The Vergecast holiday spectacular. The man loves the cable.

52
00:04:22,915 --> 00:04:26,255
Speaker 6:  But let me just say this to open, we're like a decade into

53
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:30,295
Speaker 6:  USPC and the only way I can really describe it is it's

54
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,295
Speaker 6:  a mess That's

55
00:04:31,295 --> 00:04:34,935
Speaker 7:  Half the story, right? It's like on the one hand, like we got it. Like we

56
00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:38,455
Speaker 7:  did it. Yeah. Somebody, you know, in, in the ancient history of

57
00:04:38,455 --> 00:04:42,095
Speaker 7:  technology was just like, what if all of our stuff plugged into the same

58
00:04:42,105 --> 00:04:46,095
Speaker 7:  stuff and you only needed one cable? And it's like, we did it.

59
00:04:46,365 --> 00:04:50,095
Speaker 7:  It's there. I only need one cable. But we did it in the

60
00:04:50,095 --> 00:04:53,855
Speaker 7:  worst and most backwards and impossibly

61
00:04:53,965 --> 00:04:56,135
Speaker 7:  confusing way possible. I

62
00:04:56,135 --> 00:05:00,055
Speaker 8:  Like that. You can sometimes brick a device or catch it on fire by plugging

63
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:02,175
Speaker 8:  in the wrong USB cord. That's cool.

64
00:05:02,525 --> 00:05:05,735
Speaker 6:  Yeah, that's what you want. You're like, this one provides the power of a

65
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:08,455
Speaker 6:  car battery to my phone. Let's just see what happens.

66
00:05:09,095 --> 00:05:12,135
Speaker 7:  I will say, have you guys noticed my, my gadgets have been much warmer

67
00:05:12,405 --> 00:05:12,695
Speaker 6:  This

68
00:05:12,695 --> 00:05:16,255
Speaker 7:  Year as a result of this. Like I, I genuinely believe that that's true. That

69
00:05:16,255 --> 00:05:20,175
Speaker 7:  like the average temperature of my phone and laptop and tablet has

70
00:05:20,175 --> 00:05:24,135
Speaker 7:  gone up as a result of USB C and the gigantic mess of cables

71
00:05:24,155 --> 00:05:25,255
Speaker 7:  in my life. I am

72
00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:29,495
Speaker 8:  Not cranking my radiator as high this year. Wow. Maybe

73
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,895
Speaker 8:  it's just a better insulated home I'm living in. But I like the theory that

74
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:34,335
Speaker 8:  my gadgets are just warmer.

75
00:05:34,845 --> 00:05:37,855
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's like a, you know, it's like spiritual. You're like, no matter

76
00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:41,135
Speaker 6:  what, I will use this amount of energy. And as the energy usage of LED lights

77
00:05:41,705 --> 00:05:45,575
Speaker 6:  drops for my old halogen, I'm gonna pump this into my cell phone instead.

78
00:05:45,975 --> 00:05:49,615
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's like, it's, it's very good. It's like a fixed sum kind of

79
00:05:49,895 --> 00:05:51,735
Speaker 6:  spirituality, you know? Yeah. I

80
00:05:51,735 --> 00:05:52,055
Speaker 7:  Like this.

81
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:54,655
Speaker 6:  To your point though, David, this has been the dream, right? We're gonna

82
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:58,285
Speaker 6:  have one cable, one interconnect, and then the reality of

83
00:05:58,665 --> 00:06:02,485
Speaker 6:  the dream that we live in is that there actually isn't

84
00:06:02,485 --> 00:06:06,085
Speaker 6:  one cable, there isn't one interconnect, but they've just

85
00:06:06,235 --> 00:06:09,725
Speaker 6:  used the same plug on lots of different things

86
00:06:10,385 --> 00:06:13,765
Speaker 6:  to make it appear as though there is one cable all life.

87
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:18,005
Speaker 6:  And that is to some extent, yes, I agree with you

88
00:06:18,205 --> 00:06:21,805
Speaker 6:  ox. There's a, there's a lot of, I wouldn't call it lying, but like

89
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:25,565
Speaker 6:  wishful obfuscation going on with U USB C.

90
00:06:25,905 --> 00:06:29,885
Speaker 6:  You're like, what if you didn't think about this too hard? Like

91
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:33,405
Speaker 6:  what if this was almost what you wanted? Huh? Is that good enough?

92
00:06:33,945 --> 00:06:37,525
Speaker 6:  But what's happening inside of it is because very few things are, are labeled

93
00:06:37,555 --> 00:06:41,325
Speaker 6:  correctly. Very few devices will tell you what is going on.

94
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:45,765
Speaker 6:  It feels more confusing than ever. even that in in one important way,

95
00:06:45,765 --> 00:06:46,605
Speaker 6:  it's gotten much simpler.

96
00:06:47,035 --> 00:06:50,645
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I think that's right. It used to be back in the good old days that

97
00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:54,885
Speaker 7:  your stuff was either, you know, micro USB or

98
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:58,085
Speaker 7:  mini USB and you could sort of distinguish them by the way that they looked.

99
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:02,125
Speaker 7:  And generally, as long as the thing fit in the thing, it was probably gonna

100
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,525
Speaker 7:  work. And it was very annoying because all the things had different things.

101
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:08,605
Speaker 7:  And in order to bring five gadgets, you had to have five things. Now it

102
00:07:08,605 --> 00:07:12,525
Speaker 7:  does feel like slightly more of a mystery where

103
00:07:12,555 --> 00:07:16,005
Speaker 7:  it's like you, you can plug it in and it fits. Like, you know that thing

104
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:19,765
Speaker 7:  where you, you have a bunch of keys on a key ring and you, you have the one

105
00:07:19,765 --> 00:07:23,685
Speaker 7:  that fits in the lock but doesn't turn. Yeah. That's very much like the USB

106
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:27,565
Speaker 7:  C experience where it's like, it goes in doesn't still, that's

107
00:07:27,565 --> 00:07:31,205
Speaker 7:  not the job. It turns out like fitting in the thing is not,

108
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:32,365
Speaker 7:  that's not the job.

109
00:07:32,665 --> 00:07:36,245
Speaker 6:  But, okay, but here's my question. Has this reduced any amount of frustration?

110
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:40,645
Speaker 6:  So one of my favorite laptops in the entire world is the

111
00:07:40,715 --> 00:07:43,885
Speaker 6:  PowerBook G four. The titanium PowerBook G four. Do you remember this thing?

112
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:47,525
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah. This is the laptop. I never had one. I've, I've coveted it the most

113
00:07:48,425 --> 00:07:51,765
Speaker 6:  of any, any laptop ever. Like it was just a beautiful thing that I couldn't

114
00:07:51,765 --> 00:07:55,405
Speaker 6:  afford when I was in college. And I'm looking at a picture of its rear panel

115
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,925
Speaker 6:  just because you were talking about different ports and it was wildly more

116
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:03,045
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah. Than just micro and mini USP back then. Right? It's, I

117
00:08:03,045 --> 00:08:05,965
Speaker 6:  bring up this laptop 'cause it was one of the thinnest laptops ever made.

118
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,165
Speaker 6:  It was one inch thick, whereas Apple said one inch thin,

119
00:08:09,915 --> 00:08:13,605
Speaker 6:  it's good marketing. But like, you know, they had done this thing where they

120
00:08:13,605 --> 00:08:17,525
Speaker 6:  had shrunk the computer in a radical way for its time. And you look

121
00:08:17,525 --> 00:08:21,445
Speaker 6:  at the back panel and you're like, the height of this computer has been determined

122
00:08:21,705 --> 00:08:22,805
Speaker 6:  by the ethernet port.

123
00:08:23,345 --> 00:08:23,565
Speaker 7:  Yes.

124
00:08:23,985 --> 00:08:27,125
Speaker 6:  And so here's, here's what's on the back of it. Alex, you're, I know you'll

125
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:30,285
Speaker 6:  love this as as I do left to right, I'm just looking at a picture.

126
00:08:30,725 --> 00:08:34,565
Speaker 6:  FireWire 400. Yeah. The most important port, the god

127
00:08:34,565 --> 00:08:38,405
Speaker 6:  port as I call it. Yeah. The best port ethernet. Yeah.

128
00:08:38,705 --> 00:08:42,325
Speaker 6:  Two SBAs. Oh, giant outlet for its fan.

129
00:08:43,115 --> 00:08:46,765
Speaker 6:  Important what appears to be a DVI connector.

130
00:08:47,065 --> 00:08:50,925
Speaker 6:  Yes. Huge mass. Like massively wide. DVI connector. That's a

131
00:08:50,925 --> 00:08:54,685
Speaker 6:  monitor out, an S video connector. Ooh. And then

132
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:58,725
Speaker 6:  I shit you not an RJ 11 jack for a 56 K motive.

133
00:08:59,045 --> 00:09:00,085
Speaker 6:  Yes, yes.

134
00:09:00,715 --> 00:09:01,765
Speaker 8:  They don't make 'em like that.

135
00:09:02,235 --> 00:09:06,205
Speaker 6:  This is not happening anymore. But that was the port selection on these computers.

136
00:09:06,585 --> 00:09:10,005
Speaker 6:  And you know, many ports have come and gone since then. But if you, if you

137
00:09:10,005 --> 00:09:13,925
Speaker 6:  think about this is maybe one of the most important laptops of all time,

138
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:17,005
Speaker 6:  and I'm just going back to it because it's port selection

139
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:21,805
Speaker 6:  seems insane now. The design of it is

140
00:09:21,825 --> 00:09:25,765
Speaker 6:  driven by the size of some of these ports. And very

141
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:29,165
Speaker 6:  often you have the wrong cable. And having the wrong cable is

142
00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:33,565
Speaker 6:  a very common frustration. And it's why I'm confident that everyone

143
00:09:33,565 --> 00:09:37,365
Speaker 6:  listening to the show is just like me, has a drawer full of

144
00:09:37,385 --> 00:09:41,245
Speaker 6:  cables, just cables just in case you gotta plug one thing

145
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:44,205
Speaker 6:  into another thing, you're never gonna throw that cable away.

146
00:09:44,345 --> 00:09:47,605
Speaker 8:  That's how I knew I was an adult was I had like a box of cables.

147
00:09:48,365 --> 00:09:51,925
Speaker 8:  I was like, this is it. Like I was like 22 straight outta college. And I

148
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,965
Speaker 8:  was like, well I'm an adult now 'cause I got this big box of cables just

149
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:55,885
Speaker 8:  like my parents did.

150
00:09:56,505 --> 00:10:00,405
Speaker 7:  So first of all, one box of cables is not enough boxes of cables. Let

151
00:10:00,425 --> 00:10:01,165
Speaker 7:  22,

152
00:10:01,285 --> 00:10:01,645
Speaker 8:  I was young,

153
00:10:02,745 --> 00:10:06,525
Speaker 7:  But the big change that I made recently in my life was I threw away all the

154
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:10,485
Speaker 7:  cables that were very old and I didn't know what they went

155
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:14,205
Speaker 7:  to. So for years I had a whole box just of cables

156
00:10:14,265 --> 00:10:18,125
Speaker 7:  to mysterious things that I didn't know about. Yeah. And I kept

157
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:21,845
Speaker 7:  them all for all this time because I had one really old western

158
00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:25,485
Speaker 7:  digital hard drive from when I was in college that I

159
00:10:25,995 --> 00:10:29,845
Speaker 7:  knew at some point I was gonna want again, but never actually took the time

160
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:33,645
Speaker 7:  to do anything with. And I had a bin full of cables that

161
00:10:33,645 --> 00:10:37,565
Speaker 7:  might have been for the hard drive and So I kept the whole bin around. And

162
00:10:38,245 --> 00:10:41,085
Speaker 7:  recently I took the hard drive to Best Buy because I literally couldn't get

163
00:10:41,085 --> 00:10:43,805
Speaker 7:  it to turn on again. They got all the stuff off of it for me and I threw

164
00:10:43,805 --> 00:10:47,645
Speaker 7:  away the whole box of mysterious cables. And it was, it was

165
00:10:47,685 --> 00:10:50,765
Speaker 7:  a truly transformative day in my life.

166
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:54,765
Speaker 6:  This is an important thing that you're bringing up. You had a product, it

167
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:57,925
Speaker 6:  may or may not have had a proprietary cable. It probably just had that weird

168
00:10:57,935 --> 00:10:59,485
Speaker 6:  super speed USB three cable.

169
00:11:00,145 --> 00:11:03,645
Speaker 7:  So its problem was its power cable, which was a proprietary thing. Yes.

170
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:07,045
Speaker 6:  This is the main thing, right? It had weird proprietary power cable with

171
00:11:07,045 --> 00:11:10,685
Speaker 6:  maybe some weird pins or a barrel connector and that

172
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:13,885
Speaker 6:  power system, there's still a lot of stuff with barrel connectors, but a

173
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:16,845
Speaker 6:  barrel connector with a a adapter and you don't know how much power is coming

174
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:20,085
Speaker 6:  at adapter and if you get rid of it then you're screwed. And you gotta get

175
00:11:20,085 --> 00:11:23,765
Speaker 6:  one of those long plastic blister packy things. Yeah. Right.

176
00:11:23,845 --> 00:11:26,365
Speaker 6:  With all the different barrel connectors and you're like sliding the dips.

177
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,525
Speaker 6:  Like that's bad. USB just

178
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:33,765
Speaker 6:  eliminated that problem from like the jump mini and

179
00:11:33,815 --> 00:11:37,685
Speaker 6:  micro USB started the, the process of eliminating that problem. Micro USB

180
00:11:37,685 --> 00:11:41,165
Speaker 6:  got pretty far along there. And then USB CI think his

181
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:45,205
Speaker 6:  almost completely obviated this thing like USB C is the

182
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:48,965
Speaker 6:  world's power connector that is un unequivocally a

183
00:11:48,965 --> 00:11:49,325
Speaker 6:  success.

184
00:11:49,705 --> 00:11:53,045
Speaker 7:  Yes, I agree with that. As the like make it turn on

185
00:11:53,535 --> 00:11:56,405
Speaker 7:  thing USB C is is a huge, huge, huge win.

186
00:11:56,625 --> 00:12:00,165
Speaker 6:  And we're now up to 240 watt USB C

187
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:03,725
Speaker 6:  chargers. There's some really great material science that's going on

188
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:07,405
Speaker 6:  underneath that. Gallium nitrate is the thing that replaces silicon and all

189
00:12:07,405 --> 00:12:11,325
Speaker 6:  these devices. There is just a furious effort at

190
00:12:11,885 --> 00:12:15,285
Speaker 6:  GaN Chargers, gallium nitrate chargers, making them carry more and more power

191
00:12:15,285 --> 00:12:19,205
Speaker 6:  in smaller, small spaces with less heat. That is just awesome.

192
00:12:19,635 --> 00:12:23,605
Speaker 6:  Like that's just a bunch of scientists and engineers and physicists making

193
00:12:23,665 --> 00:12:24,045
Speaker 6:  it happen.

194
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:28,405
Speaker 7:  Is it just my impression that Anchor is way ahead on the

195
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:32,205
Speaker 7:  gallium nitrate stuff? Like is there a reason Anchor stuff seems to be so

196
00:12:32,205 --> 00:12:33,565
Speaker 7:  popular in that world right now?

197
00:12:33,775 --> 00:12:36,685
Speaker 6:  Right. Anchor's a fascinating company. It was a bunch of people who worked

198
00:12:36,685 --> 00:12:39,605
Speaker 6:  at Amazon. They realized this was an ecosystem they could sell into. They

199
00:12:39,605 --> 00:12:43,205
Speaker 6:  went off and started a company, they saw a lot of things. Now the CEO of

200
00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:47,085
Speaker 6:  anchor Steven Yang was on decoder in 2021 and he told me that they had partnered

201
00:12:47,085 --> 00:12:50,885
Speaker 6:  with a company called Power Innovations, which makes like

202
00:12:50,885 --> 00:12:52,885
Speaker 6:  the bleeding edge Gallium nitrite

203
00:12:53,155 --> 00:12:54,805
Speaker 7:  Also a very Amazon sounding brand.

204
00:12:55,135 --> 00:12:59,005
Speaker 6:  Truly. No, that's, it's like too many real words. Like now

205
00:12:59,005 --> 00:13:01,765
Speaker 6:  it's just like letter like letters and numbers. But basically Anchor has

206
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:05,725
Speaker 6:  an exclusive on bleeding edge GaN chip sets. Oh. So they get 'em

207
00:13:05,725 --> 00:13:08,645
Speaker 6:  for like a year, six months to a year before everybody else. And you can

208
00:13:08,645 --> 00:13:12,045
Speaker 6:  see that's really cool, right? Just from like a business perspective.

209
00:13:12,595 --> 00:13:16,045
Speaker 6:  They identified that as a competitive advantage, went out and spent the money

210
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:19,605
Speaker 6:  ahead of it. And now they have a six month exclusive in the same way that,

211
00:13:19,605 --> 00:13:23,565
Speaker 6:  you know, like Sony buys exclusives on PlayStation games like anchors, like

212
00:13:23,565 --> 00:13:26,205
Speaker 6:  we have exclusives on GaN chip sets for a minute. It's

213
00:13:26,225 --> 00:13:26,645
Speaker 7:  Badass.

214
00:13:26,745 --> 00:13:29,605
Speaker 6:  That's obviously changed. Like there's other companies and there are other

215
00:13:29,805 --> 00:13:32,445
Speaker 6:  companies that that are, that are more aggressive. Like you go on Amazon,

216
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:35,725
Speaker 6:  you're like 600 watt charger, it's the size of a quarter and you're like,

217
00:13:35,725 --> 00:13:35,885
Speaker 6:  I don

218
00:13:36,035 --> 00:13:36,965
Speaker 8:  Will it catch fire?

219
00:13:38,345 --> 00:13:41,565
Speaker 6:  But so just from that perspective, USB C is a huge success

220
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:45,845
Speaker 6:  because of GaN because of this material science innovation because these

221
00:13:46,085 --> 00:13:49,485
Speaker 6:  companies have identified a, a market opportunity in selling more higher

222
00:13:49,485 --> 00:13:52,725
Speaker 6:  powered chargers can do everything. That means you can get everything from

223
00:13:52,725 --> 00:13:56,645
Speaker 6:  an electric toothbrush to a laptop off the same charger with the same

224
00:13:56,645 --> 00:13:59,965
Speaker 6:  plug over the sometimes the same cables, the cables have to rated.

225
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:03,925
Speaker 6:  That's a, just an overall like barrel connector should go away.

226
00:14:04,495 --> 00:14:05,605
Speaker 6:  Seems like a big victory.

227
00:14:06,075 --> 00:14:09,525
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I agree with that. And I think it has made the like

228
00:14:10,135 --> 00:14:13,645
Speaker 7:  multi-port charger thing like a true must have

229
00:14:13,675 --> 00:14:16,645
Speaker 7:  accessory in life. Yeah. Like the one thing you can plug into the wall that

230
00:14:16,645 --> 00:14:20,125
Speaker 7:  has the three USB slots on it. Anchor cells, I'm sure

231
00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:24,685
Speaker 7:  infinity of them. So do lots of other companies. I started to see them everywhere.

232
00:14:24,685 --> 00:14:28,605
Speaker 7:  Like I noticed this, I was flying last week and it honestly

233
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:32,005
Speaker 7:  seemed like one in every three people at the airport either had

234
00:14:32,485 --> 00:14:36,125
Speaker 7:  a battery pack or something you could plug into the wall and get

235
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:40,245
Speaker 7:  multiple USB ports out of And that is just now like how everybody charges

236
00:14:40,245 --> 00:14:41,325
Speaker 7:  everything. Yeah.

237
00:14:41,345 --> 00:14:44,845
Speaker 6:  And and that's created the market for battery packs. Right. You just see,

238
00:14:44,845 --> 00:14:47,485
Speaker 6:  okay, the market sort of got created here in a big way.

239
00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:51,525
Speaker 8:  I just call them the flail. The flail because like you plug enough quartz

240
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:53,165
Speaker 8:  in, it just looks like a little flail. You

241
00:14:53,175 --> 00:14:54,325
Speaker 7:  Swing it around. Yeah, I like

242
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:55,085
Speaker 8:  That. Ugh.

243
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:59,485
Speaker 6:  So that's a good thing inside of that, still some problems, right? Right.

244
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:03,245
Speaker 6:  Not every product supports every charging speed.

245
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:07,205
Speaker 6:  I still just worry that things are getting hot as we've mentioned a few times.

246
00:15:07,745 --> 00:15:09,725
Speaker 6:  And then there's the problem, which we've talked about in the rich house

247
00:15:09,805 --> 00:15:13,405
Speaker 6:  a few times now, where a lot of companies are doing this in the laziest possible

248
00:15:13,405 --> 00:15:17,285
Speaker 6:  way. They're not adding the pennies of additional costs to

249
00:15:17,285 --> 00:15:20,965
Speaker 6:  their products to put on the two resistors that make USB C

250
00:15:21,015 --> 00:15:24,205
Speaker 6:  power go. So they've effectively just replaced

251
00:15:24,905 --> 00:15:28,885
Speaker 6:  the micro USB port with a USB C port. And

252
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:32,645
Speaker 6:  if you plug an actual USB C to USB C charger onto it,

253
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:36,645
Speaker 6:  it doesn't charge because the thing doesn't know how to call for power from

254
00:15:36,765 --> 00:15:40,725
Speaker 6:  USB C 'cause it's not actually USB C you have to use a USB A to USB

255
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:44,645
Speaker 6:  C cord, which just drives me insane. And I,

256
00:15:45,185 --> 00:15:48,685
Speaker 6:  I'm gonna propose on this, the Holiday spectacular in the holiday spirit

257
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:52,125
Speaker 6:  in the spirit of Christmas, that all of those people should go to jail.

258
00:15:54,385 --> 00:15:58,085
Speaker 6:  And I, I can't think of a better present for all of us gathered today

259
00:15:58,385 --> 00:16:02,325
Speaker 6:  around the Holiday hearth than jail. But that could be my

260
00:16:02,325 --> 00:16:06,245
Speaker 6:  gift to America and the world. I think we can agree. I will have done the

261
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:08,965
Speaker 6:  Christmas community at least as much of a service as Mariah Carey,

262
00:16:09,015 --> 00:16:12,245
Speaker 7:  We're skipping right past like coal and everybody's stocking. We're going

263
00:16:12,365 --> 00:16:12,805
Speaker 7:  straight to jail.

264
00:16:13,365 --> 00:16:13,445
Speaker 8:  Straight

265
00:16:13,445 --> 00:16:14,845
Speaker 7:  To jail. I like it. All. right.

266
00:16:15,025 --> 00:16:18,965
Speaker 6:  Th and that I would say represents the best case of USB C right? We've, we've

267
00:16:18,965 --> 00:16:21,885
Speaker 6:  basically solved this power problem. We've created a market for a new kind

268
00:16:21,885 --> 00:16:25,765
Speaker 6:  of product, these battery packs and these multi chargers. There's a lot

269
00:16:25,765 --> 00:16:29,605
Speaker 6:  of innovation and engineering resources and money and invention going into

270
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:33,485
Speaker 6:  a thing. And it has tangible consumer benefits. And then there's

271
00:16:33,485 --> 00:16:37,205
Speaker 6:  like 4% of it that's bad, which is like the cheapest products. It's a lot

272
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:40,845
Speaker 6:  of off-brand headphones and speakers. I think I've mentioned the, the milk

273
00:16:40,845 --> 00:16:44,525
Speaker 6:  frother we use to stir protein powder. It's like, that's really annoying.

274
00:16:44,715 --> 00:16:48,045
Speaker 6:  There's just a bunch of that stuff where they just like, USB C will fix it

275
00:16:48,265 --> 00:16:51,205
Speaker 6:  and they didn't do it the right way. So it frustrates everyone. I, we've

276
00:16:51,205 --> 00:16:53,565
Speaker 6:  had people since we've mentioned it the first time, we've gotten a bunch

277
00:16:53,565 --> 00:16:56,045
Speaker 6:  of emails from people who are like, I threw something away 'cause I didn't

278
00:16:56,045 --> 00:16:56,885
Speaker 6:  realize this was the problem.

279
00:16:57,065 --> 00:16:57,925
Speaker 7:  Oh wow. I thought it

280
00:16:57,925 --> 00:17:01,805
Speaker 6:  Was just broken. That's crazy to me. Yeah. And I'm saying this is

281
00:17:01,805 --> 00:17:02,285
Speaker 6:  the best case.

282
00:17:02,825 --> 00:17:06,725
Speaker 7:  So, so far the worst experience I've personally had is kinda

283
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:10,565
Speaker 7:  what you're describing with the, the A to C connector where you plug it in

284
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:14,405
Speaker 7:  and nothing happens. I have not had anything problematic

285
00:17:14,505 --> 00:17:18,445
Speaker 7:  happen. I know there are risks. It's like you could plug something in and

286
00:17:18,445 --> 00:17:21,485
Speaker 7:  your phone could explode. That's a real thing that could in theory happen

287
00:17:21,995 --> 00:17:25,925
Speaker 7:  that has not happened to me. Have either of you had sort of actual bad

288
00:17:26,065 --> 00:17:29,925
Speaker 7:  USB C experiences so far? Mine are just all, I plug

289
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:33,125
Speaker 7:  a thing in, nothing happens. I take it out, I plug it in, nothing happens.

290
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:36,285
Speaker 7:  And then I get angry at my battery being dead. Feel

291
00:17:36,285 --> 00:17:40,085
Speaker 8:  Like I busted a hard drive. I feel like I busted like an off-brand hard

292
00:17:40,085 --> 00:17:43,725
Speaker 8:  drive by plugging it into the wrong USB C And it just died.

293
00:17:43,995 --> 00:17:46,245
Speaker 8:  Yeah. It was just like, nope. No ma'am.

294
00:17:46,355 --> 00:17:49,525
Speaker 7:  That actually kind of makes sense. It like tries to come to life and then

295
00:17:49,525 --> 00:17:50,285
Speaker 7:  just uhuh

296
00:17:50,305 --> 00:17:53,165
Speaker 8:  And like after that, even when I found the right cables, it never worked.

297
00:17:53,725 --> 00:17:57,325
Speaker 8:  And I blame was it maybe because the hard drive was crappy? Possibly.

298
00:17:58,065 --> 00:18:00,325
Speaker 8:  But I like to blame the USB CI

299
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:03,765
Speaker 6:  Have a similar experience. It is dumber than

300
00:18:03,985 --> 00:18:07,925
Speaker 6:  Alex's. I don don't want to don don't wanna mince words

301
00:18:08,055 --> 00:18:08,485
Speaker 6:  about it.

302
00:18:08,665 --> 00:18:10,605
Speaker 7:  So you were drinking some eggnog one night. Was

303
00:18:10,605 --> 00:18:11,085
Speaker 8:  It a beard

304
00:18:11,085 --> 00:18:15,045
Speaker 6:  Trimmer? It was not a beard trimmer. My beard trimmer is not yet USB. CI

305
00:18:15,045 --> 00:18:17,965
Speaker 6:  don't that that needs a full on barrel connector to get through this forest.

306
00:18:19,025 --> 00:18:22,925
Speaker 6:  You gotta you gotta rev the engine. Max has a like a vtech kid

307
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:26,845
Speaker 6:  zoom camera. If you have children, you, you know that these things

308
00:18:26,865 --> 00:18:30,125
Speaker 6:  are just, they're everywhere. Every kid has one. They're fun, they're cute

309
00:18:30,505 --> 00:18:34,285
Speaker 6:  and they are notorious for being really finicky about

310
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:38,605
Speaker 6:  what USB c cables are compatible with them. Even just

311
00:18:38,635 --> 00:18:42,565
Speaker 6:  regular USB a to micro USB cable, real messy. Like some

312
00:18:42,565 --> 00:18:45,445
Speaker 6:  of 'em work, some of 'em don't. And everyone I know just ends up buying a

313
00:18:45,445 --> 00:18:49,245
Speaker 6:  micro SSD card to use because the cable thing is so

314
00:18:49,325 --> 00:18:53,005
Speaker 6:  fussy with these cameras. Yeah, I didn't do that every time I like get,

315
00:18:53,355 --> 00:18:56,125
Speaker 6:  want to get photos off the camera. I remember that. I should buy a micro

316
00:18:56,525 --> 00:18:59,485
Speaker 6:  SD card for this camera. So I don't have to deal with trying 500 cables.

317
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:03,165
Speaker 6:  And then I forget don don't do it. So I'm trying to get photos off

318
00:19:03,285 --> 00:19:06,965
Speaker 6:  this thing and obviously my laptop only has USPC ports on it. So I'm like

319
00:19:06,965 --> 00:19:10,805
Speaker 6:  going through adapters and the adapters end up effectively

320
00:19:10,895 --> 00:19:14,685
Speaker 6:  corrupting photos on the camera until I finally gave up, came

321
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:18,765
Speaker 6:  upstairs to this delightful 2015 iMac that I used to Vergecast from

322
00:19:19,065 --> 00:19:23,005
Speaker 6:  and plugged directly into USB a port on the back of it. And I got

323
00:19:23,005 --> 00:19:26,965
Speaker 6:  off whatever photos I could and I was like, this is bad. Yeah, yeah. Right.

324
00:19:27,105 --> 00:19:31,085
Speaker 6:  And that's like a dongle problem. And you know, it's like, it, it's

325
00:19:31,085 --> 00:19:34,205
Speaker 6:  all, it's like kind of all the messes at once. But like you should be able

326
00:19:34,205 --> 00:19:37,285
Speaker 6:  to just plug into what is effectively an SD card reader and get files

327
00:19:37,715 --> 00:19:41,645
Speaker 6:  without thinking, okay, this thing is USB a that

328
00:19:41,645 --> 00:19:44,565
Speaker 6:  thing is USPC, this thing is a really finicky micro SSD

329
00:19:45,065 --> 00:19:48,365
Speaker 6:  implementation. And now I've corrupted some photos that my kid took on our

330
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:52,205
Speaker 6:  camera. That's by far the worst USB experience I had. And somewhere

331
00:19:52,205 --> 00:19:55,325
Speaker 6:  in there is that I was leaping through Dongle Town.

332
00:19:56,005 --> 00:19:59,845
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Well and the the problem with that is it's so sneaky

333
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:03,605
Speaker 7:  in its problem that it makes everything worse. Right? Like

334
00:20:04,005 --> 00:20:07,485
Speaker 7:  I don't have the right cable for this. It's a very obvious problem. It's

335
00:20:07,485 --> 00:20:10,445
Speaker 7:  a very annoying problem. But you at least know what the problem is. Yeah.

336
00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:13,645
Speaker 7:  And then it's like, okay, if I go get the correct cable, everything will

337
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:17,605
Speaker 7:  be fine. In this case, you're, you're left to like troubleshoot

338
00:20:17,685 --> 00:20:21,245
Speaker 7:  through a bunch of steps that you have no actual visibility into. Because

339
00:20:21,245 --> 00:20:24,125
Speaker 7:  something along the way that seemed like it probably should have worked and

340
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:28,085
Speaker 7:  all fit together literally and figuratively didn't work. And that's

341
00:20:28,085 --> 00:20:31,005
Speaker 7:  the thing about USB C that has always driven me the most crazy, like the

342
00:20:31,285 --> 00:20:35,085
Speaker 7:  Opal camera came with a USB C cable and would only work

343
00:20:35,085 --> 00:20:38,565
Speaker 7:  with its USB C cable. And it's like my friends that is,

344
00:20:39,175 --> 00:20:43,005
Speaker 7:  we're doing it wrong here. That is like not the spirit of a universal

345
00:20:43,005 --> 00:20:45,725
Speaker 7:  connector at that point. Just have a proprietary barrel connector. What the

346
00:20:45,725 --> 00:20:46,525
Speaker 7:  hell difference does it make?

347
00:20:46,675 --> 00:20:50,045
Speaker 8:  Well that just explains something about my Opal camera. So

348
00:20:51,525 --> 00:20:52,285
Speaker 8:  I learned something.

349
00:20:52,825 --> 00:20:56,365
Speaker 6:  So we, we, I've said it, I've said the magical incantation. We have to talk

350
00:20:56,365 --> 00:20:58,045
Speaker 6:  about it now we gotta talk about Dongle Town.

351
00:20:58,225 --> 00:21:01,885
Speaker 7:  The magical incantation is just the word dongle town. Yeah. And the dongles

352
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:02,285
Speaker 7:  show up

353
00:21:02,905 --> 00:21:06,285
Speaker 6:  And now we're in Dongle Town. You just like say it three times and then you

354
00:21:06,285 --> 00:21:10,205
Speaker 6:  go to dongle town. So USB C first comes out, I remind everyone it came out

355
00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:13,845
Speaker 6:  first on the Apple MacBook, the, the tiny little

356
00:21:13,845 --> 00:21:16,765
Speaker 6:  MacBook, still the world's best playing computer. Remember that computer

357
00:21:16,765 --> 00:21:20,645
Speaker 6:  only had a single port, it was so tiny. And I, again, I go back to the titanium

358
00:21:20,645 --> 00:21:24,485
Speaker 6:  PowerBook G four that I was talking about. That computer it, a

359
00:21:24,485 --> 00:21:27,125
Speaker 6:  real design constraint for that computer was the height of the ethernet port.

360
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:30,605
Speaker 6:  Apple says we don't wanna do this. This is also the, what you might call

361
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:34,565
Speaker 6:  the, the peak Johnny I era. We wanna make the laptop as thin as possible.

362
00:21:34,975 --> 00:21:38,205
Speaker 6:  We're gonna cut it down to just a single port because all you need to do

363
00:21:38,205 --> 00:21:41,205
Speaker 6:  with this computer is charge it. Maybe you wanna do some data stuff. So

364
00:21:41,935 --> 00:21:45,645
Speaker 6:  we'll use USB C we'll figure out how to charge it. They went to the

365
00:21:45,765 --> 00:21:48,965
Speaker 6:  USB C implementers form the USB IF Apple

366
00:21:49,205 --> 00:21:53,045
Speaker 6:  dictates the design of USB C They have had a hand on this

367
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:56,125
Speaker 6:  wheel since the very beginning and it started with that first MacBook.

368
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,885
Speaker 7:  Yeah, there's a lot of lightning in USB C for that reason.

369
00:21:59,115 --> 00:22:01,765
Speaker 6:  Yeah. There's a, there's a lot of Apple ideas in there. The connector is

370
00:22:01,765 --> 00:22:04,805
Speaker 6:  very much their idea. It was designed to be a partner to Lightning, which

371
00:22:04,805 --> 00:22:08,485
Speaker 6:  is how they got, they were able to get there in the end with the iPhone,

372
00:22:08,485 --> 00:22:12,445
Speaker 6:  which we should talk about. But you know, this MacBook comes out and everyone

373
00:22:12,475 --> 00:22:16,445
Speaker 6:  says, ah, dongle town. Like in order to use this computer you will have

374
00:22:16,445 --> 00:22:20,045
Speaker 6:  to have a series of complicated dongles and apple's response to this with

375
00:22:20,045 --> 00:22:24,005
Speaker 6:  that computer in particular was no you won't because no

376
00:22:24,005 --> 00:22:27,445
Speaker 6:  one plugs anything into our laptops. We've, we've done the research, we've

377
00:22:27,445 --> 00:22:30,885
Speaker 6:  done the studies, especially consumer laptops. No one plugs anything in

378
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:34,645
Speaker 6:  Be Happy with wifi and Bluetooth fine. And this computer is so

379
00:22:34,685 --> 00:22:37,765
Speaker 6:  underpowered that it is true that no one ever plugs

380
00:22:38,245 --> 00:22:38,485
Speaker 7:  Anything in

381
00:22:39,555 --> 00:22:43,445
Speaker 6:  Like when I, I had two of them and I, I truly believe that this is

382
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:47,005
Speaker 6:  the world's best travel computer. I took this thing on planes I've live logged

383
00:22:47,085 --> 00:22:50,245
Speaker 6:  a million Apple events with with one of them. It had a terrible butterfly

384
00:22:50,445 --> 00:22:54,165
Speaker 6:  keyboard. Many, many compromises. But I never felt like I need to plug anything

385
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:57,765
Speaker 6:  into this other than a power cable. Yeah. You move through the years

386
00:22:58,265 --> 00:23:02,045
Speaker 6:  and Apple releases many more computers now maybe they have two USB C

387
00:23:02,045 --> 00:23:05,965
Speaker 6:  ports and we are in dongle town. Like in order to have a laptop,

388
00:23:06,145 --> 00:23:09,805
Speaker 6:  you've gotta have one of those like eight in one dongles that has a bunch

389
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:13,325
Speaker 6:  of useful ports on it. Apple eventually relents their

390
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:17,045
Speaker 6:  MacBook Pros now have lots and lots of ports. There are literal cheers in

391
00:23:17,045 --> 00:23:19,525
Speaker 6:  the audience. And they're like the SD card reader is back on the MacBook

392
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:23,445
Speaker 6:  Pro. Yeah. My MacBook Pro is an HDMI port on it. Like we're many

393
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:26,125
Speaker 6:  ways back to what we, where we started. But all the ports have gotten smaller.

394
00:23:26,465 --> 00:23:29,805
Speaker 6:  And I'm sitting here in 2024. I'm wondering are we, are we in dongle town

395
00:23:29,805 --> 00:23:32,125
Speaker 6:  anymore? Like I, I still carry one around but I don't know why

396
00:23:32,965 --> 00:23:33,125
Speaker 8:  Security,

397
00:23:33,595 --> 00:23:37,005
Speaker 6:  Like maybe Sometimes I need a USB a port and that's it. That's all I can

398
00:23:37,005 --> 00:23:37,245
Speaker 6:  think of.

399
00:23:37,355 --> 00:23:41,245
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I I carry mine for the USB A and also like I was always

400
00:23:41,265 --> 00:23:45,005
Speaker 8:  in dongle town because of that stupid dv like

401
00:23:45,225 --> 00:23:49,125
Speaker 8:  if you had a monitor it always was VGA and then your laptop was

402
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:52,765
Speaker 8:  always DVI. So you were always doing dongles anyway, I didn't have to carry

403
00:23:52,785 --> 00:23:56,605
Speaker 8:  as many of them. Like, it wasn't for little small quick things

404
00:23:56,605 --> 00:24:00,485
Speaker 8:  like SSD card reads and, and oh I need to plug a thumb drive in So

405
00:24:01,045 --> 00:24:03,485
Speaker 8:  I. Don't know I'm still a dongle town. I'm okay with it.

406
00:24:03,905 --> 00:24:06,925
Speaker 7:  So the thing that I wonder, hearing you talk about this though, is whose

407
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:10,525
Speaker 7:  fault is that? Because like, I'm, I'm sitting here on

408
00:24:10,785 --> 00:24:14,085
Speaker 7:  the computer I use every day as a MAC mini that I have connected to a

409
00:24:14,565 --> 00:24:17,805
Speaker 7:  scepter monitor that I bought for super cheap on Amazon and could tell you

410
00:24:17,805 --> 00:24:21,285
Speaker 7:  nothing about except that it exists and it's my monitor. It uses

411
00:24:21,645 --> 00:24:25,525
Speaker 7:  HDMI, so it's HDMI to HDMI. And that is just the way

412
00:24:25,525 --> 00:24:28,405
Speaker 7:  that It works. And I'm like, whose fault is it that I don't connect these

413
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:31,965
Speaker 7:  two things to a USB cable? Because I think there's a world in which the answer

414
00:24:31,965 --> 00:24:35,925
Speaker 7:  to the MacBook Pros problem was more USB c ports

415
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:39,365
Speaker 7:  not let's bring back the old ports. And I think bringing back the old ports

416
00:24:39,365 --> 00:24:43,285
Speaker 7:  was the right call, but I can't figure out whose fault it is that we haven't

417
00:24:43,345 --> 00:24:46,645
Speaker 7:  gotten to the all USB c everything

418
00:24:46,915 --> 00:24:50,005
Speaker 7:  accessory universe faster. It's

419
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:53,925
Speaker 8:  A lot of cost stuff, right? Like, like it's more expensive

420
00:24:54,185 --> 00:24:56,925
Speaker 8:  to, to put in a lot of these ports. When you talk to the monitor makers,

421
00:24:57,195 --> 00:25:00,725
Speaker 8:  they, they're like, well no our, our people want display port because

422
00:25:00,755 --> 00:25:03,965
Speaker 8:  there's some stuff that USB C can't do that display port can't and vice versa.

423
00:25:04,365 --> 00:25:07,565
Speaker 7:  I refuse to believe that, that anyone on earth wants display port.

424
00:25:08,025 --> 00:25:08,405
Speaker 8:  Oh my

425
00:25:08,405 --> 00:25:12,325
Speaker 6:  God. Well display port is a better standard than HT MI that is maybe for

426
00:25:12,325 --> 00:25:13,125
Speaker 6:  next year. Oh that's

427
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:13,285
Speaker 7:  True.

428
00:25:13,515 --> 00:25:16,005
Speaker 6:  Next year's holiday spectacular is just display port

429
00:25:16,845 --> 00:25:19,845
Speaker 6:  V-H-D-M-I, you know, like we'll do it as a court case.

430
00:25:20,155 --> 00:25:21,285
Speaker 7:  Love it. But you're,

431
00:25:21,285 --> 00:25:24,245
Speaker 8:  You're, you're seeing it like the monitors I'm on right now are these two

432
00:25:24,245 --> 00:25:28,205
Speaker 8:  like $800 LG monitors that I'm still very upset that I

433
00:25:28,205 --> 00:25:31,245
Speaker 8:  spent this much money on as I did on them. But they've got USB C on the back

434
00:25:31,245 --> 00:25:34,245
Speaker 8:  and, and It works, but they also have USB A and that's the only way you can

435
00:25:34,265 --> 00:25:38,005
Speaker 8:  use the back lights on them to like make the back lights do cool stuff.

436
00:25:38,465 --> 00:25:40,805
Speaker 8:  So it's like they're kind of dumb.

437
00:25:42,235 --> 00:25:46,205
Speaker 6:  Well so you get USB C as a connector might be good and can

438
00:25:46,205 --> 00:25:50,005
Speaker 6:  support all this power USB C is a standard, is

439
00:25:50,385 --> 00:25:54,085
Speaker 6:  not capable of doing all the things that you want. Right? And so if you were

440
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:58,005
Speaker 6:  to go to an all USB C world to Alex's point, you would

441
00:25:58,285 --> 00:26:02,205
Speaker 6:  increase cost 'cause you'd be basically building in adapters somewhere along

442
00:26:02,205 --> 00:26:06,005
Speaker 6:  the line to move the data into different kinds of

443
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:09,765
Speaker 6:  standards or different kinds of pin configurations. And I think you do want

444
00:26:09,765 --> 00:26:13,125
Speaker 6:  an HT MI that is focused on being the best

445
00:26:13,515 --> 00:26:17,005
Speaker 6:  display connector up against its mortal rival

446
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:20,605
Speaker 6:  display port, which is better. And I think you do want a display port team

447
00:26:20,865 --> 00:26:23,805
Speaker 6:  that's like we're taking 'em down Merry Christmas.

448
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:27,685
Speaker 7:  You're describing like bundling and unbundling, right? Like we've, we, we've

449
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:31,205
Speaker 7:  been through a bundling phase, which is USB C and then everybody's gonna

450
00:26:31,205 --> 00:26:35,045
Speaker 7:  come to the realization that oh it's great that all of this is in one

451
00:26:35,045 --> 00:26:37,645
Speaker 7:  place, but what it means when it tries to be everything is that it can't

452
00:26:37,645 --> 00:26:40,365
Speaker 7:  be the best at anything. And then we're gonna spend the next decade with

453
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:44,085
Speaker 7:  like a new series of very specific one-to-one

454
00:26:44,265 --> 00:26:48,125
Speaker 7:  things that are better at one thing than USB C. And then we're gonna do

455
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:50,885
Speaker 7:  this again in 10 years and be like, wouldn't it be great if we had a standard

456
00:26:50,885 --> 00:26:53,525
Speaker 7:  that just brought everything together and you could just plug it in. I

457
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:55,645
Speaker 8:  Don? I don't think it's that many things though when you think about like

458
00:26:55,645 --> 00:26:58,525
Speaker 8:  what the ports are being used. It's, it's vi it's visual ports, right? Like

459
00:26:58,525 --> 00:27:02,165
Speaker 8:  it's HTMI and display port and that's because they're really good

460
00:27:02,305 --> 00:27:05,965
Speaker 8:  at at doing visual stuff in a way that USB C just isn't quite as good at.

461
00:27:06,145 --> 00:27:09,925
Speaker 8:  But if you think about most like data transfer, everybody's moved to USB

462
00:27:09,965 --> 00:27:13,365
Speaker 8:  C or they're using Thunderbolt, which is like USB C but more expensive and

463
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:14,005
Speaker 8:  it's the same port

464
00:27:15,015 --> 00:27:16,005
Speaker 7:  Fancy USB C, it's

465
00:27:16,095 --> 00:27:19,845
Speaker 8:  Fancy USB C and even audio you maybe have an an

466
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:23,845
Speaker 8:  optical audio out, but typically the 3.5 millimeter jack is like more

467
00:27:23,845 --> 00:27:27,285
Speaker 8:  than enough for most people. And phones, they're like no, we don't even need

468
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:28,445
Speaker 8:  that. USB is enough.

469
00:27:28,805 --> 00:27:31,605
Speaker 7:  I was gonna say, I can't believe Neil, I just let you get that far into that

470
00:27:31,805 --> 00:27:31,925
Speaker 7:  sentence.

471
00:27:32,105 --> 00:27:33,125
Speaker 6:  No, I hitched that her That's

472
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:33,325
Speaker 7:  Fine. I

473
00:27:33,325 --> 00:27:36,805
Speaker 8:  Was, I was going as fast as I could to get get there before the hissing.

474
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:37,245
Speaker 8:  No, but

475
00:27:37,245 --> 00:27:41,005
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I think you're right. It's like right the, the really fast data transfer

476
00:27:41,005 --> 00:27:44,645
Speaker 6:  like lives in the world of pci, Thunderbolt and PCI have

477
00:27:45,285 --> 00:27:48,805
Speaker 6:  a connection there that's important. Everything else is kind of on USB

478
00:27:49,145 --> 00:27:52,565
Speaker 6:  and then the thing that is not is the two display connectors.

479
00:27:52,945 --> 00:27:56,405
Speaker 6:  And even that is getting into a realm of silliness, right? Where

480
00:27:56,955 --> 00:28:00,685
Speaker 6:  it's like how many eight K displays can Apple plug into one Mac mini

481
00:28:00,785 --> 00:28:04,045
Speaker 6:  is like, that's how we're measuring how, how, how important those are. And

482
00:28:04,045 --> 00:28:07,205
Speaker 6:  maybe some things over time like additional HDR bandwidth or more colors

483
00:28:07,305 --> 00:28:11,045
Speaker 6:  or whatever is gonna be needed there will come and I'm sure it'll be great.

484
00:28:11,305 --> 00:28:15,285
Speaker 6:  But most everything now can run on USB C and what you're, what you see is

485
00:28:16,185 --> 00:28:19,285
Speaker 6:  Yep. Sometimes you sit in a conference room and there's just a bundle of

486
00:28:19,285 --> 00:28:23,085
Speaker 6:  display adapters sitting on the Yeah. On the table. But they all have USB

487
00:28:23,085 --> 00:28:26,685
Speaker 6:  connectors on the end. That to me just feels like a, a kind of victory.

488
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:31,005
Speaker 6:  I'm not sure it's the right one. Like we defeated complexity with

489
00:28:31,005 --> 00:28:34,685
Speaker 6:  additional complexity but at least all the connectors are the same. Yeah.

490
00:28:34,705 --> 00:28:37,805
Speaker 7:  But it's smaller complexity I guess. Which is something Yeah. That's a win.

491
00:28:37,805 --> 00:28:40,805
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I mean part of me feels like, I think I, I'm torn between these two

492
00:28:40,805 --> 00:28:43,885
Speaker 7:  ideas that this transition is, was always gonna take a long time because

493
00:28:43,945 --> 00:28:47,925
Speaker 7:  it essentially involves replacing every gadget on earth at

494
00:28:47,925 --> 00:28:51,725
Speaker 7:  some point. And that's a lot of work. And you can fix your own

495
00:28:51,745 --> 00:28:55,125
Speaker 7:  gadget and like I've seen this even with the iPhone 15, right? Getting the

496
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:58,965
Speaker 7:  iPhone 15, fantastic love being able to use USB C

497
00:28:58,985 --> 00:29:01,885
Speaker 7:  my wife and I can now charge our phones with the same thing. She has a Pixel.

498
00:29:02,005 --> 00:29:05,925
Speaker 7:  I have an iPhone. It's great. Huge victories for everybody. I have a

499
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:09,525
Speaker 7:  new cable that I had to get for my car. My phone now doesn't plug into certain

500
00:29:09,525 --> 00:29:12,205
Speaker 7:  things that used to plug into, I have a bunch of accessories that are now

501
00:29:12,205 --> 00:29:15,445
Speaker 7:  dead. Right? Like that transition's gonna take a long time and I, I get that.

502
00:29:15,705 --> 00:29:19,645
Speaker 7:  But also we've been at this for a decade now and it doesn't feel like

503
00:29:19,735 --> 00:29:23,565
Speaker 7:  we're close. Yeah. And So I, I can't decide if we're running too slowly or

504
00:29:23,565 --> 00:29:26,085
Speaker 7:  if I'm being too ambitious here. Let's

505
00:29:26,085 --> 00:29:29,605
Speaker 6:  Wrap this up by talking about the, the big news of the year for USB C

506
00:29:29,775 --> 00:29:33,765
Speaker 6:  Apple switched the iPhone to USB C. Yeah. This is the big thing in a, in

507
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:37,605
Speaker 6:  a normal universe when that happened we'd run a

508
00:29:37,765 --> 00:29:41,405
Speaker 6:  headline like USB C arrives or it's finally here, the

509
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:45,205
Speaker 6:  transition's. And that is just, no one's doing that because of the iPhone.

510
00:29:45,205 --> 00:29:48,485
Speaker 6:  That's what I mean. Instead it's, yeah to your point it's a combo of finally

511
00:29:48,945 --> 00:29:52,645
Speaker 6:  and oh boy this is gonna take a long time. Yeah and I feel that way

512
00:29:52,865 --> 00:29:56,405
Speaker 6:  to be clear, I feel that way about USB A too, but because there isn't some

513
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:01,165
Speaker 6:  giant company that is switching away from USB A to mark

514
00:30:01,205 --> 00:30:04,965
Speaker 6:  a moment. It's hard to talk about in the same way. but it is true that

515
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:09,045
Speaker 6:  USB A is I believe in world history, the most

516
00:30:09,045 --> 00:30:12,285
Speaker 6:  popular power port of all time. Like it is the most popular

517
00:30:12,755 --> 00:30:16,285
Speaker 6:  plug outlet in world history. I believe it. It's just everywhere. It it a

518
00:30:16,485 --> 00:30:20,325
Speaker 6:  standard you can be anywhere in the world and you see a USB, a port

519
00:30:20,545 --> 00:30:24,125
Speaker 6:  and you're like, I'm gonna plug these God awful cheap LED strip lights into

520
00:30:24,245 --> 00:30:25,005
Speaker 6:  'em and they're gonna light up.

521
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:27,405
Speaker 7:  Well first you're gonna have to flip it over 'cause you plugged it in wrong.

522
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,325
Speaker 7:  Exactly. But that the second time it'll work.

523
00:30:29,785 --> 00:30:33,365
Speaker 6:  That's kind of amazing. No other plug outlet has ever, I'm gonna charge my

524
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:37,085
Speaker 6:  phone. I found a USB, a port God I hope it isn't loaded

525
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,725
Speaker 6:  with malware. I'm gonna carry one of those little adapters that only that

526
00:30:39,725 --> 00:30:43,405
Speaker 6:  cuts everything with the power. That's incredible. But that is also,

527
00:30:43,545 --> 00:30:46,325
Speaker 6:  you gotta take all of those out. We, you know, we're renovating our house.

528
00:30:46,385 --> 00:30:50,365
Speaker 6:  I'm buying plug outlets and I'm buying plug outlets with USB C and

529
00:30:50,785 --> 00:30:54,605
Speaker 6:  one USB A in the middle. 'cause there's enough stuff that I know I'm gonna

530
00:30:54,805 --> 00:30:58,685
Speaker 6:  wanna plug into that plug outlet. That's nuts. And now I've just

531
00:30:58,685 --> 00:31:02,165
Speaker 6:  installed another USB, a outlet into the wall of this house that's gonna

532
00:31:02,165 --> 00:31:03,325
Speaker 6:  be there for 20 years. Right.

533
00:31:03,325 --> 00:31:05,205
Speaker 7:  You're both helping and hurting all at the same time.

534
00:31:05,205 --> 00:31:07,805
Speaker 6:  You're persisting. It's, and it's the same with lightning like apple. There's

535
00:31:07,805 --> 00:31:11,085
Speaker 6:  you know, a billion plus iOS devices out there with lightning ports on them.

536
00:31:11,575 --> 00:31:14,725
Speaker 6:  Apple still selling some phones with lightning ports. Apple still sell some

537
00:31:14,895 --> 00:31:17,965
Speaker 6:  iPads with lightning ports on them. Yeah. They're gonna keep selling 'em

538
00:31:17,965 --> 00:31:21,685
Speaker 6:  for a long time. EU be damned Merry Christmas to the

539
00:31:21,885 --> 00:31:25,605
Speaker 6:  European Commission says Tim Cook happy

540
00:31:25,605 --> 00:31:28,925
Speaker 6:  holidays you bastards. And he ships his billionth iPad.

541
00:31:29,395 --> 00:31:33,325
Speaker 6:  Like that stuff isn't going anywhere and it kind of means the, the core

542
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:37,245
Speaker 6:  dream of USPC, maybe no connector will ever achieve it. Right?

543
00:31:37,405 --> 00:31:41,325
Speaker 6:  'cause there's always gonna be standard sort of waxing and waning and as

544
00:31:41,325 --> 00:31:45,005
Speaker 6:  everything gets bigger and everything becomes a computer, the installed bases

545
00:31:45,005 --> 00:31:46,725
Speaker 6:  just get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and people

546
00:31:46,725 --> 00:31:50,125
Speaker 8:  Are cheap. I mean how long has the PS two port

547
00:31:50,635 --> 00:31:54,165
Speaker 8:  persisted? I think you could probably buy something with a PS two port right

548
00:31:54,165 --> 00:31:57,525
Speaker 8:  now and you shouldn't Yeah, you shouldn't be able to do that. That's just

549
00:31:57,525 --> 00:32:01,405
Speaker 8:  stupid. It's like it's older than half of the people that we

550
00:32:01,405 --> 00:32:01,765
Speaker 8:  work with

551
00:32:02,355 --> 00:32:05,885
Speaker 6:  That said this is true. You can get all the way here. I've seen people

552
00:32:06,205 --> 00:32:09,765
Speaker 6:  assemble just the most bananas USB C dongle chains.

553
00:32:09,915 --> 00:32:13,685
Speaker 6:  Yeah. You can get an A PSS two to USB A to

554
00:32:13,805 --> 00:32:17,765
Speaker 6:  USB C connector and use them on a lot of computers. People still use

555
00:32:17,765 --> 00:32:21,325
Speaker 6:  Apple extended keyboard twos. They're very popular. The big clicky keys.

556
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:24,965
Speaker 6:  Apple desktop bust to USB A to USB C Totally works.

557
00:32:25,515 --> 00:32:29,325
Speaker 6:  It's kind of amazing, you know when software backwards compatibility is so

558
00:32:29,325 --> 00:32:33,205
Speaker 6:  hard yet with USB C in hardware, people almost take

559
00:32:33,205 --> 00:32:34,965
Speaker 6:  it for granted. Which is pretty incredible.

560
00:32:35,395 --> 00:32:39,165
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I mean kudos to like the people who did this for making it a continuing

561
00:32:39,365 --> 00:32:43,005
Speaker 7:  standard. But I think now we're at a point where we've agreed that this is

562
00:32:43,005 --> 00:32:46,845
Speaker 7:  the standard and it's gonna keep moving so fast that I wonder if we're gonna

563
00:32:46,845 --> 00:32:50,605
Speaker 7:  end up sort of accidentally at another unrecognizable standard before too

564
00:32:50,605 --> 00:32:54,365
Speaker 7:  long and if maybe we're even there already. Like USB C is a

565
00:32:54,365 --> 00:32:57,685
Speaker 7:  collection of different things that all kind of look the same already and

566
00:32:58,105 --> 00:33:01,685
Speaker 7:  the EU is out here regulating like what the port has to look like. And I

567
00:33:01,685 --> 00:33:05,325
Speaker 7:  think that's good. But I also wonder if instead of that thing you're describing

568
00:33:05,325 --> 00:33:09,165
Speaker 7:  where we've kind of had really good connectivity over

569
00:33:09,165 --> 00:33:13,045
Speaker 7:  the years between the ideas of USB, if instead

570
00:33:13,045 --> 00:33:15,445
Speaker 7:  we're gonna have a bunch of things that look the same and are very different

571
00:33:15,825 --> 00:33:19,285
Speaker 7:  and that's just gonna be where it lands. I have no idea. I

572
00:33:19,285 --> 00:33:23,165
Speaker 8:  Mean that's what we're doing with HDMI right now and and a lot of other ports

573
00:33:23,165 --> 00:33:26,885
Speaker 8:  is there's like that conflict and nobody wants to properly label things.

574
00:33:26,955 --> 00:33:30,405
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And if they just properly labeled things and made the labels easy to

575
00:33:30,405 --> 00:33:33,445
Speaker 8:  understand, this would all be solved. But Oh yeah.

576
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:37,285
Speaker 6:  If you are a member of the United States Congress listening to this The

577
00:33:37,445 --> 00:33:40,805
Speaker 6:  Vergecast holiday spectacular about USB C welcome.

578
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:44,445
Speaker 7:  I think there's at least 40 or 50 senators listening to this right now. No

579
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:44,685
Speaker 7:  question.

580
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:46,845
Speaker 6:  At least half the Senate is listening to this.

581
00:33:48,435 --> 00:33:50,285
Speaker 6:  Look, first of all, if you're listening to this and you're in Congress, you

582
00:33:50,285 --> 00:33:52,245
Speaker 6:  are the most effective politicians s here.

583
00:33:53,885 --> 00:33:57,445
Speaker 6:  I want you to feel great about it. You are here on the ground with the people.

584
00:33:57,985 --> 00:34:01,925
Speaker 6:  You're sharing the holiday spirit with them and you are talking about

585
00:34:01,925 --> 00:34:05,765
Speaker 6:  real problems in America. Second, you have an opportunity

586
00:34:06,145 --> 00:34:10,045
Speaker 6:  to outdo the Europeans if you just pass some labeling standards.

587
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:13,845
Speaker 6:  Everything in tech right now is being regulated by the Europeans. Yep. You

588
00:34:13,845 --> 00:34:17,725
Speaker 6:  know, and you can, you can do it, you can take weird St Nicholas

589
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:21,605
Speaker 6:  from France and turn 'em into Santa Claus in the greatest American

590
00:34:21,885 --> 00:34:25,125
Speaker 6:  Christmas spirit. You can do it and you can say, look, you are, you are,

591
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:29,085
Speaker 6:  you're focused on USB C here in America. We label our wires and

592
00:34:29,085 --> 00:34:32,685
Speaker 6:  you can, you can just take Christmas from them and I want you to do it please.

593
00:34:32,685 --> 00:34:36,205
Speaker 6:  Because that is actually what we just put labels on the plugs that say how

594
00:34:36,205 --> 00:34:40,165
Speaker 6:  fast they can charge and how much data they they can support. And then everyone

595
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:43,125
Speaker 6:  will be happy will, will lead better lives in America.

596
00:34:43,705 --> 00:34:46,645
Speaker 7:  You have to also make it a Spec that people care about. Like this is the,

597
00:34:46,825 --> 00:34:50,685
Speaker 7:  the learning experience over Christmas. Like sit down and really learn about

598
00:34:51,145 --> 00:34:55,085
Speaker 7:  the charging requirements of all of your individual devices. Take

599
00:34:55,085 --> 00:34:58,765
Speaker 7:  some time instead of reading the night before Christmas, read some instruction

600
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:02,645
Speaker 7:  manuals to your computers. Yeah. Because like I think about what,

601
00:35:02,645 --> 00:35:05,525
Speaker 7:  what happened to TVs, right? Like everybody got very aware of what seven

602
00:35:05,525 --> 00:35:09,405
Speaker 7:  20 P and 10 80 p and 4K and eight K were and those things get better because

603
00:35:09,405 --> 00:35:13,125
Speaker 7:  people start to care about it and they'll buy the better ones. And now

604
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:17,005
Speaker 7:  I've become like a, a zealot for telling people to buy expensive cables,

605
00:35:17,005 --> 00:35:19,525
Speaker 7:  which is the opposite of what I used to say. I used to tell people just like

606
00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:22,645
Speaker 7:  buy the Amazon basics, the cheapest thing you can find for whatever cable

607
00:35:22,665 --> 00:35:26,525
Speaker 7:  you need. It'll probably work now. I'm like if you wanna live the as

608
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:29,605
Speaker 7:  few cables as possible lifestyle, you have to buy good ones and you have

609
00:35:29,605 --> 00:35:33,285
Speaker 7:  to buy ones that are more than most of your devices need in order for it

610
00:35:33,285 --> 00:35:36,965
Speaker 7:  to work for most of your devices. And people just don't know

611
00:35:37,045 --> 00:35:39,805
Speaker 7:  because they've never had to and realistically they shouldn't. Like this

612
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:43,085
Speaker 7:  should be a solved problem. But we, this has to be a thing people care about.

613
00:35:43,085 --> 00:35:46,805
Speaker 7:  Like I'm the problem because I didn't make sure that my monitor was

614
00:35:46,865 --> 00:35:50,525
Speaker 7:  the right connectivity for what I wanted. And if we don't start to demand

615
00:35:50,525 --> 00:35:51,965
Speaker 7:  that it won't get better.

616
00:35:52,305 --> 00:35:56,085
Speaker 6:  That's wild. Right. 'cause HDMI, which carries much more data on the regular,

617
00:35:56,105 --> 00:35:59,085
Speaker 6:  it needs to be more reliable in order to support all the high end video standards.

618
00:35:59,345 --> 00:36:01,725
Speaker 6:  It is kind of like just buy whatever cable. Right.

619
00:36:01,865 --> 00:36:03,125
Speaker 8:  But it's not truly,

620
00:36:03,505 --> 00:36:05,525
Speaker 7:  But it's close enough. Like for most cases,

621
00:36:06,025 --> 00:36:08,205
Speaker 6:  If you're out there buying the monster cables like you're getting taken for

622
00:36:08,205 --> 00:36:11,645
Speaker 6:  a ride, if you buy a high quality HTMI cable, it's gonna be fine. Yeah.

623
00:36:11,855 --> 00:36:14,605
Speaker 6:  Right. In a way that if you don't buy a high

624
00:36:15,395 --> 00:36:19,365
Speaker 6:  quality USB c cable, you, you bone, you're not guaranteed to get life out

625
00:36:19,365 --> 00:36:21,925
Speaker 6:  of it through as like technology progresses. And

626
00:36:21,925 --> 00:36:25,605
Speaker 7:  You'll notice the difference. Like I, I work in my basement and my

627
00:36:25,675 --> 00:36:28,805
Speaker 7:  bedroom is two floors away upstairs. All of my cables are right next to me.

628
00:36:29,185 --> 00:36:33,085
Speaker 7:  The thing I use to charge my phone all the way upstairs is a piece of

629
00:36:33,435 --> 00:36:37,245
Speaker 7:  crap USB C cable that takes a hundred thousand years to charge my phone and

630
00:36:37,245 --> 00:36:41,045
Speaker 7:  I have to change it and I have not because I keep forgetting when I'm upstairs

631
00:36:41,105 --> 00:36:43,925
Speaker 7:  and it's too much work to come all the way downstairs. But it's like it,

632
00:36:43,995 --> 00:36:47,645
Speaker 7:  it's a real thing. And you will notice the difference between a really good

633
00:36:47,645 --> 00:36:51,085
Speaker 7:  cable and a really crappy cable in a way that I think with HDMI like most

634
00:36:51,285 --> 00:36:53,485
Speaker 7:  people are not going to notice the difference. Yeah.

635
00:36:53,485 --> 00:36:57,365
Speaker 8:  Most people don't even know like HDMI 2.0 and 2.1 and so they're like that's

636
00:36:57,365 --> 00:36:57,565
Speaker 8:  fine.

637
00:36:57,875 --> 00:37:01,685
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And if you're like, let's spend $65 on this cable, like someone will

638
00:37:01,685 --> 00:37:03,565
Speaker 7:  come out and just start screaming at you.

639
00:37:03,705 --> 00:37:06,205
Speaker 8:  But you know if your milk foamer is not charging, it's

640
00:37:06,205 --> 00:37:09,765
Speaker 7:  Exactly right. Neli can't make coffee if his milk foamer is not charging.

641
00:37:09,865 --> 00:37:10,725
Speaker 7:  And that's very important.

642
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:15,285
Speaker 6:  Okay, here's my last piece on this and then we should go to the game

643
00:37:15,285 --> 00:37:19,245
Speaker 6:  show. This was the year that Apple did the big transition to

644
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:23,325
Speaker 6:  USB C. The iPhone has it now. The EU has mandated it that

645
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:26,925
Speaker 6:  this is all big news. I I feel like that's stuff in the weeds of it

646
00:37:27,305 --> 00:37:31,165
Speaker 6:  is less important than how does it feel to use technology that

647
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:34,885
Speaker 6:  all has this port. So that's what we spend our time on. but it is the thing

648
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:37,845
Speaker 6:  that happened. Does that feel like it was a success? Does it feel like it

649
00:37:37,845 --> 00:37:41,765
Speaker 6:  will be an enduring success or are we just waiting for

650
00:37:41,945 --> 00:37:45,365
Speaker 6:  USB C USB CD to come along?

651
00:37:47,705 --> 00:37:48,245
Speaker 6:  USB F

652
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:50,285
Speaker 7:  Six G will change everything you'd like.

653
00:37:50,445 --> 00:37:54,045
Speaker 6:  That's what I'm saying. Will six G change everything or did we get there

654
00:37:54,235 --> 00:37:57,685
Speaker 6:  with this big European regulation? And finally the switch from the iPhone

655
00:37:57,955 --> 00:37:58,765
Speaker 7:  Alex. What do you think

656
00:37:58,775 --> 00:37:59,565
Speaker 8:  It'll change? Nothing.

657
00:38:00,025 --> 00:38:01,405
Speaker 6:  You think it'll change? Nothing. I don't think

658
00:38:01,565 --> 00:38:05,485
Speaker 8:  Anything's gonna change really. I think we're gonna continue this like slow

659
00:38:06,155 --> 00:38:06,445
Speaker 8:  roll.

660
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:10,245
Speaker 7:  I'm a little more hopeful than that. I think the iPhone changing

661
00:38:10,985 --> 00:38:14,285
Speaker 7:  is a big deal. I think it would've been a bigger deal if the iPhone had switched

662
00:38:14,305 --> 00:38:17,965
Speaker 7:  10 years ago. I think there's a really interesting parallel universe if

663
00:38:18,275 --> 00:38:22,005
Speaker 7:  instead of launching USB C on a MacBook, it had launched it on an

664
00:38:22,005 --> 00:38:25,925
Speaker 7:  iPhone and how the technology world would look different. Now all

665
00:38:25,925 --> 00:38:28,565
Speaker 7:  these years after that I think it would look very different and much better.

666
00:38:28,955 --> 00:38:32,645
Speaker 7:  I've talked to a lot of people in the last say six months who are very

667
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:36,485
Speaker 7:  excited about this and what it'll mean for the kinds of accessories

668
00:38:36,545 --> 00:38:40,485
Speaker 7:  you can buy. Knowing that they're gonna last more than the life of

669
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:43,925
Speaker 7:  your phone and the kinds of things that you can put into cars and put into

670
00:38:43,925 --> 00:38:47,645
Speaker 7:  fixtures in your house and like with confidence that this port is going to

671
00:38:47,645 --> 00:38:51,445
Speaker 7:  be around in some way for the next let's say 10 years. There's stuff

672
00:38:51,445 --> 00:38:55,165
Speaker 7:  you can do that is cool and different and exciting for everybody.

673
00:38:55,645 --> 00:38:59,525
Speaker 7:  I think if we are still in this place where I can plug a thing into my devices

674
00:38:59,585 --> 00:39:02,805
Speaker 7:  and I have no idea what's gonna happen in another 12 months,

675
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:06,045
Speaker 7:  I'm gonna be a lot less optimistic. Join

676
00:39:06,065 --> 00:39:06,285
Speaker 8:  Me.

677
00:39:06,515 --> 00:39:10,245
Speaker 7:  Yeah, either. Either We're gonna spend 2024 like weeding out the

678
00:39:10,665 --> 00:39:14,405
Speaker 7:  crappy stuff on Amazon starting to figure this stuff out The next rev. A

679
00:39:14,405 --> 00:39:17,205
Speaker 7:  lot of of a lot of these gadgets will make more affordances for that stuff

680
00:39:17,205 --> 00:39:20,885
Speaker 7:  and it'll be great. Or we're just gonna be overrun by

681
00:39:21,145 --> 00:39:25,125
Speaker 7:  crappy USB A the USB C gadgets. And I'm gonna be on Alex's side saying

682
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:26,885
Speaker 7:  actually nothing has gotten better. Yeah.

683
00:39:27,035 --> 00:39:27,325
Speaker 8:  Yeah.

684
00:39:27,825 --> 00:39:30,605
Speaker 6:  I'm somewhere in the middle. And here's what I'll throw out there to just

685
00:39:31,175 --> 00:39:35,045
Speaker 6:  complexify this whole situation. My family has a wide variety of

686
00:39:35,045 --> 00:39:38,805
Speaker 6:  iPhones in it and some of us have a USB C iPhones, some of us have lightning

687
00:39:38,805 --> 00:39:42,565
Speaker 6:  iPhones and the most popular person on my family on our recent

688
00:39:42,565 --> 00:39:46,285
Speaker 6:  family trip was my nephew who had a MagSafe battery

689
00:39:46,285 --> 00:39:48,285
Speaker 6:  pack that worked with everyone's

690
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:49,925
Speaker 7:  Phones. That's so real.

691
00:39:50,315 --> 00:39:54,245
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And it, it was like, oh there's another thing going on here that

692
00:39:54,245 --> 00:39:57,845
Speaker 6:  is interesting. Right? There's another out for Apple, you know, MagSafe and

693
00:39:57,865 --> 00:40:01,325
Speaker 6:  she charging Q2 and MagSafe are really tightly aligned. That's becoming its

694
00:40:01,325 --> 00:40:05,125
Speaker 6:  own little standard right next to USB CII think that's gonna make the

695
00:40:05,215 --> 00:40:09,125
Speaker 6:  ecosystems a little more interesting and a little more compatible. But

696
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:12,965
Speaker 6:  we'll see. Like that's the only thing I'll throw in the mix. I'm also optimistic

697
00:40:13,435 --> 00:40:17,125
Speaker 6:  that at least one turn of it is done and that

698
00:40:17,305 --> 00:40:21,285
Speaker 6:  USB C seems future proofed in a way. Like it's the thing,

699
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:25,005
Speaker 6:  it can support everything from a laptop to whatever to change the

700
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:28,565
Speaker 6:  world's laptops to the next power standard. You need a good reason.

701
00:40:29,075 --> 00:40:32,925
Speaker 6:  Like this is a tiny little connector and you get a hundred watts out of it.

702
00:40:32,925 --> 00:40:36,845
Speaker 6:  240 watts out of it to that's most laptops. You don't need anything

703
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:40,365
Speaker 6:  like it. The design constraint it imposes is not an inch tall

704
00:40:40,685 --> 00:40:44,485
Speaker 6:  ethernet connector. Like you can get what you want out of it. So I,

705
00:40:44,485 --> 00:40:48,445
Speaker 6:  that's my hope is that it has done what it needs to do for now and

706
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:51,725
Speaker 6:  the next turn looks like magnetic charging or whatever. And that is gonna

707
00:40:51,725 --> 00:40:55,005
Speaker 6:  make this transition hopefully a little easier 'cause there's something compatible

708
00:40:55,005 --> 00:40:58,885
Speaker 6:  with both along the way. And then if a year or two from now, most

709
00:40:58,885 --> 00:41:00,645
Speaker 6:  things will just have USB C and people will just understand it.

710
00:41:00,785 --> 00:41:03,445
Speaker 7:  And then after that we get to the thing. What was the thing where it was

711
00:41:03,445 --> 00:41:06,725
Speaker 7:  like a, a lamp that sits in the corner of your room and like beams power

712
00:41:06,745 --> 00:41:07,125
Speaker 7:  at you?

713
00:41:07,315 --> 00:41:10,485
Speaker 8:  Yeah, it's the, they're at CES every year and every year they're like, we

714
00:41:10,485 --> 00:41:12,445
Speaker 8:  could do it. And every year it's like, well then do

715
00:41:12,445 --> 00:41:13,765

805
00:48:15,265 --> 00:48:18,165
Speaker 6:  Oh, this is very complicated now. 'cause I think Alex is way too high and

806
00:48:18,165 --> 00:48:21,845
Speaker 6:  I think David's way too low. $117.

807
00:48:22,515 --> 00:48:22,805

815
00:48:42,995 --> 00:48:46,925
Speaker 6:  Look, my father was an emergency room doctor. Do not do that

816
00:48:46,995 --> 00:48:49,045
Speaker 6:  with things that cost 29 90

817
00:48:49,855 --> 00:48:51,605

818
00:48:52,785 --> 00:48:53,005

820
00:48:56,555 --> 00:49:00,245
Speaker 1:  Okay. That means all three of you actually bid over the retail price,

821
00:49:00,385 --> 00:49:03,605
Speaker 1:  so no points. Oh yeah. Chris are awarded for this gadget.

822
00:49:04,225 --> 00:49:06,885
Speaker 1:  But let's move on to our next USB C Gadget.

823
00:49:08,075 --> 00:49:12,005
Speaker 9:  It's rechargeable heated socks by Weston. These stockings will keep

824
00:49:12,005 --> 00:49:15,725
Speaker 9:  your feet warm all day. With the power of two small batteries, you tuck into

825
00:49:15,765 --> 00:49:19,205
Speaker 9:  a pocket sewn into the socks, which are rechargeable by the

826
00:49:19,405 --> 00:49:23,005
Speaker 9:  included USB C cable rechargeable socks by Weston.

827
00:49:24,315 --> 00:49:28,045
Speaker 1:  Alright, contestants currently on Weston's website, these socks are

828
00:49:28,245 --> 00:49:31,165
Speaker 1:  actually 50% off. But at what price?

829
00:49:31,875 --> 00:49:35,005
Speaker 6:  Wait, what is the discount price or what is the regular price? What

830
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:36,725
Speaker 1:  Is the discounted price?

831
00:49:37,465 --> 00:49:38,125
Speaker 8:  That's harder.

832
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:41,085
Speaker 6:  I feel like this tracks with what David is saying is that these are probably

833
00:49:41,085 --> 00:49:44,805
Speaker 6:  never sold at the real price. Correct. Like you have to psychologically manipulate

834
00:49:44,805 --> 00:49:48,245
Speaker 6:  people into believing they're getting a deal in order to sell battery socks.

835
00:49:48,845 --> 00:49:52,645
Speaker 7:  Normally these are $1,000 and today they're six bucks.

836
00:49:53,275 --> 00:49:54,765
Speaker 1:  Alright, contestants, are you ready?

837
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:55,725

Speaker 8:  Ooh. See? 'cause it socks. Socks are sneakily expensive

847
00:50:19,925 --> 00:50:23,405

848
00:50:23,405 --> 00:50:25,325
Speaker 8:  96 cents.

849
00:50:25,785 --> 00:50:28,245
Speaker 6:  You think the socks cost more than the camera

850
00:50:28,685 --> 00:50:29,165
Speaker 8:  Y? Yes.

851
00:50:29,705 --> 00:50:33,285

00:50:40,525 --> 00:50:42,285
Speaker 8:  I told you socks are pricey.

855
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:46,325
Speaker 6:  I'm just gonna say this out loud. What I've learned from two rounds of USB

856
00:50:46,405 --> 00:50:50,245
Speaker 6:  C prices right, is people respect some parts of their body much more

857
00:50:50,245 --> 00:50:51,245
Speaker 6:  than other parts of

858
00:50:51,245 --> 00:50:54,805
Speaker 1:  Their body. You can get the USB a version of these socks for

859
00:50:54,905 --> 00:50:56,245
Speaker 1:  1 99. Oh

860
00:50:56,245 --> 00:50:56,685
Speaker 6:  My God.

861
00:50:57,265 --> 00:50:58,725
Speaker 1:  I'm kidding. I I totally made that up.

862
00:51:00,355 --> 00:51:03,365
Speaker 1:  Okay, let's get to our final gadget for guess the price.

977
00:56:45,195 --> 00:56:48,845

987
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:18,125
Speaker 7:  I put a hundred because for the same reason I was like one plus is just get

00:57:59,805 --> 00:58:01,485
Speaker 7:  I got a whopping two, right?

00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:03,365
Speaker 1:  Two correct. From David Pierce

1004
00:58:03,725 --> 00:58:07,085
Speaker 7:  I have probably five other ones that are one

1005
00:58:08,165 --> 00:58:12,125
Speaker 7:  rung away. Like should I have put a hundred when I put 96? Yes, I

1006
00:58:12,125 --> 00:58:16,045
Speaker 7:  should have. Should I have put 80 when I put 96? Yes. I should

1007
00:58:16,045 --> 00:58:19,645
Speaker 7:  have tough beat for David Kabi. I'm sorry, four points for me.

00:58:19,795 --> 00:58:23,045
Speaker 1:  Alright, Alex Cranz, how many correct guesses do you have?

1009
00:58:23,275 --> 00:58:27,165
Speaker 8:  Well I can't make fun of David 'cause it's the exact same two. I

1010
00:58:27,165 --> 00:58:31,125
Speaker 8:  also got two. Right. But I got two right in the last round. So, I'm, I'm

1011
00:58:31,125 --> 00:58:31,885
Speaker 8:  winning. Did

1012
00:58:31,885 --> 00:58:35,045
Speaker 6:  You both try to do the highest and lowest first? Like I knew that PS five

1013
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:37,805
Speaker 6:  was the lowest. Yes. And then I was just trying to figure out where the highest

1014
00:58:37,825 --> 00:58:39,085
Speaker 6:  was and I knew it was the MacBook.

1015
00:58:39,285 --> 00:58:42,925
Speaker 8:  I did highest first and then I started to scramble because I realized

1016
00:58:43,065 --> 00:58:46,605
Speaker 8:  I'd done it all wrong but it was too late. So I was like, oh, PSPS. I know

1017
00:58:46,605 --> 00:58:49,485
Speaker 8:  that one's gonna be low and that's, that's the one I got right.

1018
00:58:50,005 --> 00:58:53,845
Speaker 7:  I very confidently, the first line I drew was iPhone 15 pro

1019
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:57,845
Speaker 7:  to 30 watts. 'cause I was sure that was like no question That was

1020
00:58:57,845 --> 00:58:58,045
Speaker 7:  correct.

1021
00:58:58,655 --> 00:58:59,605
Speaker 8:  Three watts off

1022
00:59:00,065 --> 00:59:03,605
Speaker 7:  And then no. I'll tell you what threw me while I'm being angry about this

1023
00:59:03,705 --> 00:59:07,605
Speaker 7:  is that the Nintendo switch is famously the hardest gadget

1024
00:59:07,605 --> 00:59:10,765
Speaker 7:  on Earth. Yes. To buy cables for So. I looked at this and I was like, what's

1025
00:59:10,765 --> 00:59:13,525
Speaker 7:  the most random number on here? Yes. 'cause I bet that's it. And I landed

1026
00:59:13,545 --> 00:59:17,445
Speaker 7:  on 27 same for the switch and I was so sure that was right because I was

1027
00:59:17,445 --> 00:59:20,885
Speaker 7:  like no other cable except the one done one that Nintendo will sell you.

1028
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:24,045
Speaker 7:  You will work. So it has to be a random one. And I was wrong and I'm furious.

1029
00:59:25,925 --> 00:59:28,885
Speaker 8:  I just randomly chose 96 and I was wrong.

1030
00:59:29,225 --> 00:59:31,965
Speaker 6:  Do you think the switch takes a 96 watts of power?

1031
00:59:33,145 --> 00:59:36,445
Speaker 6:  The switch has the processing horsepower of a phone from 2009.

1032
00:59:37,565 --> 00:59:39,605
Speaker 8:  I was like maybe it's just gets thirsty.

1033
00:59:40,115 --> 00:59:43,165
Speaker 1:  Well I will just say you guys are doing much better than you did last year

1034
00:59:43,165 --> 00:59:45,365
Speaker 1:  on the Bluetooth jeopardy game. So fair

1035
00:59:45,365 --> 00:59:45,605
Speaker 6:  Enough.

1036
00:59:46,175 --> 00:59:50,165
Speaker 1:  Let's review the points from that round. Eli got 10 points

1037
00:59:50,305 --> 00:59:52,125
Speaker 1:  for his five correct guesses. Yeah.

1038
00:59:52,375 --> 00:59:52,925
Speaker 7:  Worst to

1039
00:59:52,925 --> 00:59:56,685
Speaker 1:  First David Pierce and Alex Cranz each got four points for their two

1040
00:59:56,685 --> 01:00:00,125
Speaker 1:  correct guesses. Bringing our grand totals to Neli at 10.

1041
01:00:00,535 --> 01:00:03,965
Speaker 1:  David at four and Alex at 14.

1042
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:04,765
Speaker 1:  Yeah.

1043
01:00:05,195 --> 01:00:05,885
Speaker 6:  Santa's back.

1044
01:00:06,165 --> 01:00:06,885
Speaker 8:  I got you Terry

1045
01:00:07,785 --> 01:00:11,085
Speaker 1:  All right now we go into round three. Round three is

1046
01:00:11,475 --> 01:00:15,205
Speaker 1:  madlibs. We have given you a sentence with a bunch of terms

1047
01:00:15,205 --> 01:00:18,845
Speaker 1:  missing but all the terms are jumbled. The sentence comes from a recent

1048
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:22,885
Speaker 1:  Android authority article spelling out just how complicated USB

1049
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:26,285
Speaker 1:  C has gotten. Fill in the gaps in the sentence with the provided terms.

1050
01:00:26,615 --> 01:00:30,605
Speaker 1:  We'll give you three points each per correct placement and the sentence is

1051
01:00:31,775 --> 01:00:35,725
Speaker 9:  Blank is based on blank and aligned with the

1052
01:00:35,725 --> 01:00:39,165
Speaker 9:  blank specification. Thereby bundling in blank

1053
01:00:39,165 --> 01:00:42,845
Speaker 9:  tunneling support for two blank or a single blank

1054
01:00:43,155 --> 01:00:46,965
Speaker 9:  display output and blank capabilities on blank

1055
01:00:47,035 --> 01:00:47,525
Speaker 9:  devices.

1056
01:00:49,825 --> 01:00:51,965
Speaker 8:  Do we have four hours to complete this?

1057
01:00:52,225 --> 01:00:54,365
Speaker 1:  And the terms we have for the sentence are

1058
01:00:54,835 --> 01:00:57,365
Speaker 9:  Display port 2.04

1059
01:00:57,485 --> 01:01:00,565
Speaker 9:  KPCI express hub

1060
01:01:01,195 --> 01:01:05,165
Speaker 9:  Thunderbolt four, USB four, Thunderbolt

1061
01:01:05,165 --> 01:01:06,805
Speaker 9:  three and eight K.

1062
01:01:08,115 --> 01:01:11,805
Speaker 1:  Alright everyone please use your worksheet to fill out the sentence.

1063
01:01:13,005 --> 01:01:13,285
Speaker 6:  I got

1064
01:01:13,285 --> 01:01:17,045
Speaker 7:  It. Can I ask for definitions on several of these words? Also is

1065
01:01:17,125 --> 01:01:20,205
Speaker 7:  PCI express a trick because no one has used that in 25 years.

1066
01:01:20,705 --> 01:01:22,765
Speaker 8:  Are there more words than there are slots?

1067
01:01:23,225 --> 01:01:23,445
Speaker 1:  No.

1068
01:01:23,865 --> 01:01:27,005
Speaker 6:  Nailed it. By the way, that's how I took the lsat in case you're wondering,

1069
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:29,925
Speaker 6:  I finished the worksheet and just stood up and said nailed it after every

1070
01:01:29,925 --> 01:01:30,245
Speaker 6:  section.

1071
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:34,685
Speaker 7:  I'm having deep regrets already but I'm, I'm locked in. I hit the buzzer

1072
01:01:35,095 --> 01:01:35,645
Speaker 1:  Cranz ready?

1073
01:01:35,995 --> 01:01:37,485
Speaker 8:  Well I guess I'm gonna have to be,

1074
01:01:39,925 --> 01:01:41,525
Speaker 8:  I barked something somewhere.

1075
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:43,965
Speaker 6:  I knew the people who took the L set that way too.

1076
01:01:46,425 --> 01:01:50,085
Speaker 1:  All right? Let's hear your sentences. Contestants starting with Alex.

1077
01:01:50,615 --> 01:01:50,965
Speaker 1:  Cranz.

1078
01:01:51,305 --> 01:01:54,965
Speaker 8:  That's rude. That's very rude. Thunderbolt

1079
01:01:55,275 --> 01:01:59,205
Speaker 8:  four is based on Thunderbolt three and aligned with

1080
01:01:59,205 --> 01:02:02,205
Speaker 8:  the PCIA express specification

1081
01:02:02,955 --> 01:02:06,885
Speaker 8:  thereby bundling in. Hmm this is where it goes really

1082
01:02:08,145 --> 01:02:11,885
Speaker 8:  bad. USB four tunneling. No that's just

1083
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:15,845
Speaker 8:  wrong Support for up to two hub or a

1084
01:02:15,845 --> 01:02:19,605
Speaker 8:  single display Port 2.0 display output

1085
01:02:21,065 --> 01:02:23,805
Speaker 8:  and 4K capabilities on eight K devices.

1086
01:02:24,705 --> 01:02:27,325
Speaker 6:  You really just ran outta words there. That's how that feels.

1087
01:02:28,355 --> 01:02:30,645
Speaker 1:  Okay, let's go with David Pierce next.

1088
01:02:30,995 --> 01:02:34,925
Speaker 7:  Thunderbolt four is based on USB four and aligned with the

1089
01:02:34,925 --> 01:02:38,685
Speaker 7:  Thunderbolt three specification thereby bundling in PCI

1090
01:02:38,685 --> 01:02:42,285
Speaker 7:  express tunneling support for up to two 4K or a single eight K

1091
01:02:42,285 --> 01:02:46,005
Speaker 7:  display output and hub capabilities on display Port 2.0 devices.

1092
01:02:46,665 --> 01:02:47,285
Speaker 6:  Oh that makes

1093
01:02:47,285 --> 01:02:49,245
Speaker 7:  Sense. I'm not sure that it does. You

1094
01:02:49,245 --> 01:02:53,085
Speaker 6:  Guys do not spend nearly enough time on the display port Wikipedia page.

1095
01:02:53,555 --> 01:02:56,365
Speaker 1:  Sean Hollister is very upset somewhere right now.

1096
01:02:57,345 --> 01:02:59,925
Speaker 1:  All right Ne Neli Patel tell us your sentence.

1097
01:03:00,725 --> 01:03:04,405
Speaker 6:  USP four is based on PCI express and aligned with a Thunderbolt four specification

1098
01:03:04,955 --> 01:03:08,565
Speaker 6:  thereby bundling in Thunderbolt three tunneling support for up to two 4K

1099
01:03:08,565 --> 01:03:11,885
Speaker 6:  displays or single eight K display output and display port 2.0 capabilities

1100
01:03:11,885 --> 01:03:12,605
Speaker 6:  on hub devices.

1101
01:03:13,425 --> 01:03:17,245
Speaker 1:  All right. I believe Neli is gonna be our winning concess here. But

1102
01:03:17,345 --> 01:03:21,085
Speaker 1:  let me read this sentence for you. It's actually

1103
01:03:21,305 --> 01:03:24,765
Speaker 1:  USB C four is based on Thunderbolt three

1104
01:03:25,345 --> 01:03:29,005
Speaker 1:  and aligned with the Thunderbolt four specifications. What?

1105
01:03:29,115 --> 01:03:31,005
Speaker 7:  That doesn't make any sense. I got one right.

1106
01:03:31,245 --> 01:03:31,845
Speaker 6:  I refuse.

1107
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:36,645
Speaker 1:  Thereby bundling in display port 2.0 tunneling support for up

1108
01:03:36,645 --> 01:03:40,045
Speaker 1:  to two 4K or a one eight K display output and

1109
01:03:40,205 --> 01:03:43,125
Speaker 1:  PCI express capabilities over hub devices.

1110
01:03:43,725 --> 01:03:47,645
Speaker 6:  I just got two words in the and they're the same word Thunderbolt and PCI

1111
01:03:47,645 --> 01:03:49,805
Speaker 6:  express are the same. The same thing.

1112
01:03:50,275 --> 01:03:52,405
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So why didn't you put 'em in the right places? Patel

1113
01:03:53,165 --> 01:03:56,165
Speaker 6:  Hominems the power of suggestion.

1114
01:03:56,585 --> 01:03:59,565
Speaker 7:  No, I maintain the first clause of this sentence

1115
01:03:59,955 --> 01:04:03,845
Speaker 7:  objectively makes no sense and should not be allowed. I refuse.

1116
01:04:04,585 --> 01:04:08,085
Speaker 1:  I'd just like to remind you this sentence came from an Android authority

1117
01:04:08,085 --> 01:04:11,725
Speaker 1:  article spelling out just how complicated USB C has gotten.

1118
01:04:12,025 --> 01:04:12,245
Speaker 1:  I'd

1119
01:04:12,245 --> 01:04:14,845
Speaker 7:  Like to have a word with Android authority. Could we bring them on the show?

1120
01:04:15,085 --> 01:04:17,605
Speaker 6:  Yes. I'd like to question your authority. Good sir.

1121
01:04:18,915 --> 01:04:22,885
Speaker 1:  Alright, so let's review that round of Mad Libs to see how we did.

1122
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:27,445
Speaker 1:  Eli Patel got five correct guesses for a total of 15 David

1123
01:04:27,465 --> 01:04:30,965
Speaker 1:  Pierce got two correct guesses for a total of six points.

1124
01:04:31,415 --> 01:04:32,165
Speaker 7:  Don't say it like

1125
01:04:32,165 --> 01:04:34,765
Speaker 1:  That. And Alex Cranz only got one correct? I

1126
01:04:34,765 --> 01:04:35,245
Speaker 8:  Got one

1127
01:04:36,025 --> 01:04:39,805
Speaker 1:  For a total of three points. Let's go back to the big board to see our

1128
01:04:39,805 --> 01:04:43,685
Speaker 1:  totals. We've got Neli Patel at 25 now taking the lead.

1129
01:04:43,785 --> 01:04:47,085
Speaker 1:  Yes, David Pierce at 10 and Alex Cranz at

1130
01:04:47,605 --> 01:04:47,805
Speaker 1:  17.

1131
01:04:48,105 --> 01:04:51,565
Speaker 6:  And it would be more if it wasn't for the corrupt Android authority whose

1132
01:04:51,565 --> 01:04:53,285
Speaker 6:  administration I will bring down.

1133
01:04:53,805 --> 01:04:55,565
Speaker 8:  I gotta crush Neli in the last

1134
01:04:55,565 --> 01:04:57,605
Speaker 6:  Round. My sets are higher Cranz

1135
01:04:57,925 --> 01:05:01,285
Speaker 7:  I think for an extra 10 points. Can Neli be forced to explain this in English?

1136
01:05:03,345 --> 01:05:07,245
Speaker 6:  Yes. Now that I have the correct one. So the, the way that I

1137
01:05:07,245 --> 01:05:10,125
Speaker 6:  always think about this just very quickly and I know I'm gonna gloss over

1138
01:05:10,125 --> 01:05:13,605
Speaker 6:  the details, but the way I always think about this is that

1139
01:05:13,835 --> 01:05:17,805
Speaker 6:  Thunderbolt and PCI express are the same thing and PCI

1140
01:05:17,805 --> 01:05:21,285
Speaker 6:  is what's in your computer and Thunderbolt is that exact same connectivity

1141
01:05:21,315 --> 01:05:24,205
Speaker 6:  over a wire. That means Thunderbolt has lots of bandwidth. It's really fast.

1142
01:05:24,385 --> 01:05:27,605
Speaker 6:  You can do expansion with it, which is how you get PCI expansion chassis

1143
01:05:27,605 --> 01:05:31,165
Speaker 6:  over Thunderbolt. It all makes sense. So all this is saying is

1144
01:05:31,475 --> 01:05:35,405
Speaker 6:  over time you SP four and Thunderbolt, as USB gets

1145
01:05:35,525 --> 01:05:39,125
Speaker 6:  faster and faster and faster, it starts to inherit the capabilities of Thunderbolt

1146
01:05:39,125 --> 01:05:42,725
Speaker 6:  because Apple and Intel are all mixed up in the standard here. They're starting

1147
01:05:42,745 --> 01:05:46,405
Speaker 6:  to align the things so that you can do more thunderbolt things

1148
01:05:46,545 --> 01:05:50,445
Speaker 6:  on USB as it gets faster. So here USB three is inheriting

1149
01:05:50,765 --> 01:05:54,445
Speaker 6:  a bunch of Thunderbolt three capabilities in alignment with

1150
01:05:54,445 --> 01:05:57,765
Speaker 6:  Thunderbolt four, which is itself getting faster. And that means USP four

1151
01:05:58,105 --> 01:06:02,085
Speaker 6:  can now do Thunderbolt three things like display Port 2.0 for two 4K or one

1152
01:06:02,085 --> 01:06:06,005
Speaker 6:  eight K device and PCI expansion on hubs.

1153
01:06:06,525 --> 01:06:08,365
Speaker 1:  I also appreciate that Neli said it in more

1154
01:06:08,365 --> 01:06:09,685
Speaker 9:  Words than Andrew authority.

1155
01:06:10,145 --> 01:06:11,205
Speaker 1:  So good job Android

1156
01:06:11,205 --> 01:06:12,725
Speaker 9:  Authority. Significantly more

1157
01:06:13,945 --> 01:06:17,765
Speaker 1:  All, right? Let's go to that final round everyone, which is the showcase.

1158
01:06:19,455 --> 01:06:23,165
Speaker 1:  Guess the price of the combined showcase without going over

1159
01:06:23,665 --> 01:06:26,645
Speaker 1:  the closest guest wins 20 points. Guess within

1160
01:06:26,705 --> 01:06:30,205
Speaker 1:  $250 we'll give you an extra five points. I hate

1161
01:06:30,205 --> 01:06:32,205
Speaker 6:  This. Can we go back to Mad Libs?

1162
01:06:32,695 --> 01:06:36,605
Speaker 1:  Guess within a hundred dollars get an extra 10 points, guess within

1163
01:06:36,615 --> 01:06:40,445
Speaker 1:  $50 and we'll give you a whopping 50 bonus points. All, right

1164
01:06:40,665 --> 01:06:44,285
Speaker 1:  Kir, this is our moment. Let's go. Let's see what we have in this showcase

1165
01:06:45,625 --> 01:06:49,205
Speaker 9:  In this package. Experience USB C in all of its many

1166

Speaker 1:  $2,499.

1216
01:09:11,505 --> 01:09:12,485
Speaker 6:  Got that exactly right.

1217
01:09:12,665 --> 01:09:15,925
Speaker 1:  The Sony headphones were $329

1218
01:09:15,925 --> 01:09:17,085
Speaker 1:  99 cents. Ah,

1219
01:09:17,285 --> 01:09:19,285
Speaker 7:  I was $20 off on that. I was so close, I

1220
01:09:19,285 --> 01:09:19,925
Speaker 6:  Was a little high there.

1221
01:09:20,225 --> 01:09:23,125
Speaker 1:  The road NT one condenser microphone was

1222
01:09:23,585 --> 01:09:25,365
Speaker 1:  $249. Oh,

1223
01:09:25,525 --> 01:09:27,885
Speaker 6:  I was just a little high actually. I was only 50 bucks high. I was

1224
01:09:27,885 --> 01:09:28,685
Speaker 7:  A hundred bucks low.

1225
01:09:29,105 --> 01:09:32,245
Speaker 1:  The anchor 5 63 docking station was

1226
01:09:32,285 --> 01:09:34,845
Speaker 1:  $129 99 cents. That's

1227
01:09:34,845 --> 01:09:36,485
Speaker 7:  A good deal. I'm way off on that one.

1228
01:09:36,705 --> 01:09:40,445
Speaker 6:  Andrew, you you put together a nice little package here. Yeah, it's very

1229
01:09:40,445 --> 01:09:40,925
Speaker 6:  affordable.

1230
01:09:41,245 --> 01:09:42,525
Speaker 8:  I put it at $50.

1231
01:09:43,305 --> 01:09:45,965
Speaker 1:  The LG dual up monitor with USB C was

1232
01:09:46,595 --> 01:09:48,045
Speaker 1:  5 99 99.

1233
01:09:48,245 --> 01:09:49,685
Speaker 7:  I put six 50. I was pretty close.

1234
01:09:50,025 --> 01:09:54,005
Speaker 8:  Why is my LG monitor half that size and twice that price?

1235
01:09:54,625 --> 01:09:57,885
Speaker 6:  You love Pixel density. The thing you don't know about the dual up is that

1236
01:09:57,885 --> 01:09:59,725
Speaker 6:  it only has 10 pixels.

1237
01:10:00,145 --> 01:10:04,005
Speaker 1:  And finally the Lytro 2023 Waterless portable essential oil diffuser from

1238
01:10:04,065 --> 01:10:06,685
Speaker 1:  Amazon at 39.99.

1239
01:10:07,185 --> 01:10:09,525
Speaker 6:  Oh, nailed that one. Yeah, I know my Amazon garbage.

1240
01:10:10,955 --> 01:10:14,205
Speaker 6:  Your company's called Lytro. When you put the year in the, in the product

1241
01:10:14,205 --> 01:10:16,165
Speaker 6:  description, you're not going over 50.

1242
01:10:17,435 --> 01:10:18,805
Speaker 8:  This is much more affordable than

1243
01:10:18,805 --> 01:10:21,605
Speaker 6:  I thought. I was high in the headphones, the microphone and the docking station

1244
01:10:21,605 --> 01:10:22,845
Speaker 6:  and that allowed David to win.

1245
01:10:23,245 --> 01:10:26,765
Speaker 7:  I had that MacBook at three grand, not 2,500.

1246
01:10:27,225 --> 01:10:31,205
Speaker 7:  And I blame Apple for not making any sense with what it tells you. And I

1247
01:10:31,205 --> 01:10:34,485
Speaker 7:  was in aggregate, basically dead on with the rest of it. So I ended up the,

1248
01:10:34,585 --> 01:10:38,525
Speaker 7:  the number I wrote down was 43 95 61. Ah. And if you take away

1249
01:10:38,525 --> 01:10:42,085
Speaker 7:  that 500 bucks, I was like, I was right there. So I'm, I'm feeling good about

1250
01:10:42,085 --> 01:10:45,245
Speaker 7:  this, but also I won anyway. So learn how to play the game. Patel David

1251
01:10:45,265 --> 01:10:48,885
Speaker 6:  Is fired and what you've won is being alone for the holidays.

1252
01:10:49,825 --> 01:10:53,285
Speaker 1:  That's correct. David got 20 points from this round. Our other two

1253
01:10:53,285 --> 01:10:57,045
Speaker 1:  contestants with zeros. That makes David our winner today with 30 points

1254
01:10:57,635 --> 01:11:01,085
Speaker 1:  Neli just behind him at 25. And finally Alex

Speaker 1:  Cranz with 17 points

1256
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:06,085
Speaker 6:  Rigged by the corrupt Android authority.

1257
01:11:07,705 --> 01:11:08,325
Speaker 8:  So sad.

1258
01:11:08,745 --> 01:11:12,525
Speaker 1:  Congratulations to our winner who David was playing for Kabir.

01:11:36,685 --> 01:11:37,485
Speaker 1:  pet population.

1266
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:42,805
Speaker 1:  We'll be right back after this break with more of the USB C holiday.

1267
01:11:42,835 --> 01:11:43,525
Speaker 1:  Spectacular

1268
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:40,245
Speaker 6:  All right, we're back. I'm gonna tell you right now, I feel like USB C

1269
01:13:40,245 --> 01:13:43,965
Speaker 6:  Price is, Right is rigged and I should have won. David is my mortal

1270
01:13:43,965 --> 01:13:44,445
Speaker 6:  enemy now.

1271
01:13:44,925 --> 01:13:48,725
Speaker 7:  I also feel like that, I feel like I, I just really

1272
01:13:48,725 --> 01:13:52,365
Speaker 7:  didn't deserve to win that like I did it. I did it for Kabir and I did it

1273
01:13:52,365 --> 01:13:55,965
Speaker 7:  for everybody, but I didn't deserve that victory. I'll take it

1274
01:13:56,205 --> 01:13:59,645
Speaker 7:  to be very clear, but I'm just looking at the sentence that I wrote and I

1275
01:13:59,645 --> 01:14:00,605
Speaker 7:  don't, I don't deserve

1276
01:14:00,885 --> 01:14:04,605
Speaker 6:  Anything. I was so close. I also can't believe we, we won with a $1

1277
01:14:04,705 --> 01:14:08,565
Speaker 6:  anyway, whatever. We we're gonna have some beef next year and also

1278
01:14:08,565 --> 01:14:11,725
Speaker 6:  most assuredly trademark lawsuit, it's just coming for us and that's fine.

1279
01:14:11,745 --> 01:14:15,725
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah. Alex in the meantime has gone on vacation. She's just

1280
01:14:15,865 --> 01:14:19,605
Speaker 6:  on Santa Slade flying around the world giving out gifts to all the good boys

1281
01:14:19,605 --> 01:14:23,245
Speaker 6:  and girls. It's great. I hope she enjoys her break. But David and I are sticking

1282
01:14:23,245 --> 01:14:26,805
Speaker 6:  around to talk to Noah Dentzel, who is the co-founder and CEO of

1283
01:14:26,935 --> 01:14:30,525
Speaker 6:  Nomad Goods. And this conversation, David, I I really enjoyed it.

1284
01:14:30,715 --> 01:14:34,485
Speaker 7:  Yeah, it was fun. We talked about USB C we talked about wireless charging.

1285
01:14:34,545 --> 01:14:38,165
Speaker 7:  We talked about just like what it means to be an accessory company

1286
01:14:38,345 --> 01:14:42,245
Speaker 7:  in this new world of USB C and it's very clear that

1287
01:14:42,245 --> 01:14:45,685
Speaker 7:  this is a thing he spends a lot of time Yeah. Thinking about and having ideas

1288
01:14:45,685 --> 01:14:48,965
Speaker 7:  about and like he didn't tell us as much of the weird stuff that they're

1289
01:14:49,045 --> 01:14:51,925
Speaker 7:  building as I wanted him to. But he told us some of the weird stuff.

1290
01:14:52,065 --> 01:14:55,325
Speaker 6:  What's fascinating about this is the iPhone switching to USB C created a

1291
01:14:55,325 --> 01:14:58,205
Speaker 6:  vast new market for USB C products, which is really interesting. And Noah

1292
01:14:58,345 --> 01:15:01,605
Speaker 6:  got all the way into what that means for how he runs the business and how

1293
01:15:01,605 --> 01:15:05,565
Speaker 6:  he can build a business around a standard like USB C right, All. right. Without

1294
01:15:05,565 --> 01:15:09,365
Speaker 6:  further ado, here's Noah Dentzel, the co-founder and CEO of Nomad Goods.

1295
01:15:15,235 --> 01:15:16,085
Speaker 6:  Welcome Noah.

1296
01:15:16,785 --> 01:15:17,965
Speaker 15:  Hey, thanks for having me.

1297
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:21,365
Speaker 6:  Thank you for celebrating the holidays with us by talking about USB C

1298
01:15:21,825 --> 01:15:25,365
Speaker 15:  Hey, this is a USB c Holiday. I'm sure there's gonna be, it's a good subject

1299
01:15:25,425 --> 01:15:29,325
Speaker 15:  for round the round the table discussion. Confusing, not too controversial.

1300
01:15:29,595 --> 01:15:29,885
Speaker 15:  Yeah,

1301
01:15:30,245 --> 01:15:32,325
Speaker 6:  Right. Everyone's got an opinion, but none of the opinions matter.

1302
01:15:32,395 --> 01:15:36,045
Speaker 7:  Confusing, not too controversial is like the perfect tagline for USB C

1303
01:15:36,305 --> 01:15:38,685
Speaker 7:  at this particular moment in time. That's very good.

1304
01:15:38,955 --> 01:15:42,565
Speaker 15:  It's definitely confusing. There's a lot of potential. It's a, it's a

1305
01:15:42,845 --> 01:15:46,525
Speaker 15:  standard size, but what's going on in that size? There's all kinds of different

1306
01:15:46,525 --> 01:15:47,445
Speaker 15:  things going on. Yeah,

1307
01:15:47,595 --> 01:15:50,605
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So this is why we wanted to have you on here. 'cause you're, you're

1308
01:15:50,805 --> 01:15:54,765
Speaker 7:  somebody who is actually like making this stuff for people in the world,

1309
01:15:54,765 --> 01:15:57,885
Speaker 7:  right? And like, just sort of poking around your website, it seems like you

1310
01:15:57,885 --> 01:16:01,445
Speaker 7:  went at some point in the last year or so, basically like

1311
01:16:01,985 --> 01:16:05,085
Speaker 7:  all in on USB C like I, I had a hard time finding

1312
01:16:05,865 --> 01:16:09,605
Speaker 7:  non USB c stuff for sale from Nomad, which I feel like in the past

1313
01:16:09,605 --> 01:16:11,965
Speaker 7:  your thing was kind of always like, we have all the cables for all the people

1314
01:16:11,985 --> 01:16:14,725
Speaker 7:  and now you're just like, it's USB C time. Get outta here.

1315
01:16:15,035 --> 01:16:18,245
Speaker 15:  Yeah. Our customer base tends to be very early adopter and we internally

1316
01:16:18,425 --> 01:16:22,085
Speaker 15:  are as well. So like the second that

1317
01:16:22,275 --> 01:16:26,125
Speaker 15:  something's even announced, we see this, we, we saw our sales shift from

1318
01:16:26,125 --> 01:16:29,605
Speaker 15:  Lightning to USB C before the iPhone 15

1319
01:16:30,025 --> 01:16:33,845
Speaker 15:  was shipping for context. Historically, when we've had

1320
01:16:33,975 --> 01:16:37,685
Speaker 15:  micro USB stuff or USB C stuff and lightning stuff, we've always been way

1321
01:16:38,005 --> 01:16:41,805
Speaker 15:  stronger on lightning and five or seven times more. Wow. And then all of

1322
01:16:41,805 --> 01:16:45,765
Speaker 15:  a sudden earlier this, this summer we saw that our

1323
01:16:45,905 --> 01:16:49,765
Speaker 15:  USB c we, we launched a product actually charge key. We launched a

1324
01:16:49,885 --> 01:16:53,645
Speaker 15:  USB C in a lightning version, and the USB C version was

1325
01:16:53,645 --> 01:16:56,085
Speaker 15:  outselling the lightning version that that would typically never happen.

1326
01:16:56,085 --> 01:16:59,885
Speaker 15:  This was before the iPhone 15 debuted. That was just based on

1327
01:16:59,885 --> 01:17:03,365
Speaker 15:  rumor and speculation. So our customers are living in that forefront.

1328
01:17:03,865 --> 01:17:07,845
Speaker 7:  So like as soon as the EU says it's USB C time, people just start going

1329
01:17:07,845 --> 01:17:10,565
Speaker 7:  to Nomads website and buying USB C stuff basically.

1330
01:17:10,915 --> 01:17:13,925
Speaker 15:  It's wild, it's fun. They keep us busy and that's where we like to play.

1331
01:17:13,945 --> 01:17:16,925
Speaker 15:  You know, that's the, that's the fun being on that front edge. When you're

1332
01:17:16,925 --> 01:17:20,645
Speaker 15:  at the beginning of a new cable era, obviously USB C's been around for a

1333
01:17:20,645 --> 01:17:24,565
Speaker 15:  while, but until the iPhone does it, you know, it doesn't seem to get the

1334
01:17:24,715 --> 01:17:28,365
Speaker 15:  recognition. Yeah, it deserves, but it's, it's this future proofing,

1335
01:17:28,415 --> 01:17:31,245
Speaker 15:  which is really cool because anything you buy right now, I mean, if I were

1336
01:17:31,245 --> 01:17:34,925
Speaker 15:  buying a car right now and it didn't have a USB C port, I would

1337
01:17:35,035 --> 01:17:38,325
Speaker 15:  rethink that car purchase, right? That's a massive purchase. I just would

1338
01:17:38,325 --> 01:17:41,765
Speaker 15:  not wanna be stuck behind. I mean, I, I honestly personally wouldn't even

1339
01:17:41,765 --> 01:17:45,645
Speaker 15:  want it to have a USB a port, but if it did, I'd, I would be

1340
01:17:45,645 --> 01:17:49,525
Speaker 15:  okay with that. That's just like we're ripping forward through USB C

1341
01:17:49,525 --> 01:17:50,245
Speaker 15:  and it's way better.

1342
01:17:50,545 --> 01:17:53,365
Speaker 6:  The car example is really interesting, right? The experience a lot of people

1343
01:17:53,915 --> 01:17:57,325
Speaker 6:  have with USB C up until now-ish maybe,

1344
01:17:57,785 --> 01:18:01,085
Speaker 6:  is that it's the new charging connector. So they would buy an Android phone,

1345
01:18:01,105 --> 01:18:05,085
Speaker 6:  it would come with a cable, maybe even a USB a to USB C cable, and

1346
01:18:05,085 --> 01:18:08,205
Speaker 6:  that's how they charge their phone. And that might be how they charged everything.

1347
01:18:08,825 --> 01:18:12,645
Speaker 6:  But then it also has this huge data functionality that is very complicated.

1348
01:18:12,665 --> 01:18:16,565
Speaker 6:  It can also be a thunderbolt cable. You're an accessory maker. How have

1349
01:18:16,565 --> 01:18:19,485
Speaker 6:  you been thinking about just communicating what does what to people? Because

1350
01:18:19,485 --> 01:18:21,605
Speaker 6:  that seems like the hardest part about USB C.

1351
01:18:22,385 --> 01:18:26,005
Speaker 15:  So we have some materials on our website and some blog information and,

1352
01:18:26,145 --> 01:18:29,885
Speaker 15:  and we probably need to do even more to explain what is

1353
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:33,845
Speaker 15:  USB C because to us, we, we get the problem of we're just surrounded by

1354
01:18:33,845 --> 01:18:36,525
Speaker 15:  this and we've been thinking about it for years and we assume everybody

1355
01:18:36,525 --> 01:18:40,285
Speaker 15:  knows, sometimes we talk about how higher wattage, you know,

1356
01:18:40,605 --> 01:18:44,365
Speaker 15:  charging a faster speed, but sometimes a really helpful piece of

1357
01:18:44,605 --> 01:18:48,445
Speaker 15:  communication is, is language surrounding like minutes to charge,

1358
01:18:48,865 --> 01:18:52,005
Speaker 15:  you know, 20% in 20 minutes that might be more

1359
01:18:52,275 --> 01:18:56,165
Speaker 15:  relatable or, or 30% in 20 minutes. So, so like, what is the

1360
01:18:56,195 --> 01:18:59,925
Speaker 15:  core thing that the person wants and how is it really helping their life?

1361
01:18:59,925 --> 01:19:03,325
Speaker 15:  Because what all these numbers mean, I mean, sometimes these numbers and

1362
01:19:03,325 --> 01:19:07,005
Speaker 15:  specs are so high and crazy and you can't even use it. The

1363
01:19:07,005 --> 01:19:10,685
Speaker 15:  iPhone can only charge at, I think it's only rated for 20, I think it charges

1364
01:19:10,705 --> 01:19:14,605
Speaker 15:  closer to 30. And often that's only for, for a very short

1365
01:19:14,605 --> 01:19:18,405
Speaker 15:  amount of time, right? You're not necessarily getting peak speeds at all

1366
01:19:18,405 --> 01:19:21,725
Speaker 15:  times. If you're over 80%, if you're really high up on your phone, you're,

1367
01:19:21,725 --> 01:19:25,565
Speaker 15:  you're gonna charge slower. So trying to break it down, let people know

1368
01:19:25,565 --> 01:19:29,405
Speaker 15:  that sometimes using the like, analogies of like, it's like a hose and the

1369
01:19:29,405 --> 01:19:33,125
Speaker 15:  size of your hose versus, you know, these are terms that, that our engineers

1370
01:19:33,195 --> 01:19:36,485
Speaker 15:  here will explain it when we're debating internally. But this

1371
01:19:36,485 --> 01:19:40,205
Speaker 7:  Makes me think like, I hate buzzwords all the time and this makes me think

1372
01:19:40,205 --> 01:19:43,685
Speaker 7:  we like really need some good buzzwords here. It's like, like Tesla did a

1373
01:19:43,685 --> 01:19:46,325
Speaker 7:  good job with superchargers, right? Where there's like, yeah, people now

1374
01:19:46,325 --> 01:19:49,125
Speaker 7:  understand that there is like a way to charger your car and then there are

1375
01:19:49,125 --> 01:19:53,005
Speaker 7:  superchargers and those are faster because super is a big fast word.

1376
01:19:53,385 --> 01:19:57,365
Speaker 7:  And now it's like maybe we need like cables and fast cables

1377
01:19:57,365 --> 01:20:01,205
Speaker 7:  and like mega cables and it's like people will suddenly understand how these

1378
01:20:01,205 --> 01:20:01,565
Speaker 7:  things work.

1379
01:20:01,945 --> 01:20:05,845
Speaker 15:  We do in, in companies like Nomad, we, we try, I mean we come

1380
01:20:05,845 --> 01:20:09,685
Speaker 15:  up with our own little internal buzzwords often from a marketing standpoint

1381
01:20:09,715 --> 01:20:13,205
Speaker 15:  it'd be like, you know, for example, you know, supercharging capability

1382
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:16,365
Speaker 15:  or something. It's, it is kind of nice when, when there's actually a standard

1383
01:20:16,605 --> 01:20:19,405
Speaker 15:  'cause then it's like, cool we are, we're building to that Spec. We'd obviously

1384
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:22,325
Speaker 15:  building to a certain Spec and it can be confusing for the consumer too

1385
01:20:22,325 --> 01:20:26,285
Speaker 15:  because there's, there's real things that are like from USB,

1386
01:20:26,425 --> 01:20:30,085
Speaker 15:  you know, the, the USB system USB standard and there's protocols on that

1387
01:20:30,245 --> 01:20:33,965
Speaker 15:  standard. And then there's marketing things that a may be actually

1388
01:20:34,155 --> 01:20:37,605
Speaker 15:  helpful because it's like, oh I can make sense of that supercharging

1389
01:20:38,245 --> 01:20:41,725
Speaker 15:  B it could just be buzzwords, but from a company. But maybe that company

1390
01:20:41,785 --> 01:20:45,685
Speaker 15:  is so big that their language confuses you and sounds official when

1391
01:20:45,685 --> 01:20:48,285
Speaker 15:  it's actually not. So, so it's wild. Yeah.

1392
01:20:48,425 --> 01:20:52,365
Speaker 6:  So that's the, the basic challenge of USB C, right? It can do so

1393
01:20:52,365 --> 01:20:56,045
Speaker 6:  many things in so many different permutations that even just

1394
01:20:56,045 --> 01:20:59,925
Speaker 6:  talking about it is hard. Which is fascinating, right? You've gotta market

1395
01:20:59,925 --> 01:21:03,525
Speaker 6:  the products, you gotta invent new things, you gotta tell people what they

1396
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:06,765
Speaker 6:  can do. But the business is built around something that's pretty

1397
01:21:07,475 --> 01:21:11,205
Speaker 6:  amorphous, right? Like Nomad makes USB C accessories. What's your

1398
01:21:11,205 --> 01:21:14,965
Speaker 6:  relationship to the standard? Like are you thinking

1399
01:21:14,965 --> 01:21:18,685
Speaker 6:  about the next version of how much power can come through a

1400
01:21:18,785 --> 01:21:22,765
Speaker 6:  PD cable? Are you saying okay, here's where the base of iPhone

1401
01:21:22,765 --> 01:21:26,645
Speaker 6:  owners is, we gotta rush some products to market. Building a company

1402
01:21:26,645 --> 01:21:29,605
Speaker 6:  around a standard seems like you need to pay a lot of attention to the standard,

1403
01:21:29,905 --> 01:21:32,725
Speaker 6:  but you can't get too far ahead 'cause the market hasn't gotten there yet.

1404
01:21:32,955 --> 01:21:35,565
Speaker 15:  Yeah, I think you just brought up a great point mentioning pd. So power

1405
01:21:35,765 --> 01:21:39,565
Speaker 15:  delivery was a great example of, of kind of a, of a standard

1406
01:21:39,875 --> 01:21:43,845
Speaker 15:  term or or threshold wattage, at which point that

1407
01:21:43,845 --> 01:21:47,685
Speaker 15:  is considered kind of the standard of fast charging challenges.

1408
01:21:47,805 --> 01:21:51,645
Speaker 15:  USB C has been just ripping and roaring forward. So I think it was

1409
01:21:51,645 --> 01:21:55,325
Speaker 15:  20 watts before Maybe it was 18. And so, so at this point,

1410
01:21:55,645 --> 01:21:59,205
Speaker 15:  charging at that speed could almost be considered kind of slow. So power

1411
01:21:59,445 --> 01:22:02,485
Speaker 15:  delivery, which was fast just a couple years ago and like in my book I'd

1412
01:22:02,485 --> 01:22:05,845
Speaker 15:  call that like good, you know, solid. Yeah. So yeah, staying on point with

1413
01:22:05,845 --> 01:22:09,645
Speaker 15:  the standards, we absolutely have the problem of chasing the front edge

1414
01:22:09,785 --> 01:22:12,325
Speaker 15:  so much. We, that's where the fun is. That's where the, the excitement is.

1415
01:22:12,505 --> 01:22:16,445
Speaker 15:  but it also can be like too far out there for sure. We've, we've

1416
01:22:16,445 --> 01:22:19,605
Speaker 15:  had that happen. We, we actually launched our first USB C product in

1417
01:22:19,605 --> 01:22:23,525
Speaker 15:  2016 I think it was, and I think it came out in 2014.

1418
01:22:23,625 --> 01:22:27,525
Speaker 15:  But like that product had a 3000 million up hour integrated battery. It

1419
01:22:27,525 --> 01:22:30,765
Speaker 15:  was 12 volt in. So you plug it into the 12 volt, the cigarette lighter thing

1420
01:22:31,145 --> 01:22:35,125
Speaker 15:  and it charged itself up it's battery and also had an A and a

1421
01:22:35,245 --> 01:22:38,365
Speaker 15:  C out. Everyone was using the A and not the C on it because it was just

1422
01:22:38,385 --> 01:22:41,645
Speaker 15:  so early and it was kind of ahead of its time. That was in 2016. So we've

1423
01:22:41,645 --> 01:22:45,525
Speaker 15:  been doing this C for a long time. We've been waiting for this moment

1424
01:22:45,625 --> 01:22:48,725
Speaker 15:  for a long time. Sometimes it can be really expensive when you're trying

1425
01:22:48,725 --> 01:22:51,445
Speaker 15:  to get on that really, really front edge and you might make a product and

1426
01:22:51,445 --> 01:22:55,285
Speaker 15:  it's super cool and it's like, do people really need this? And, and

1427
01:22:55,385 --> 01:22:58,405
Speaker 15:  to need it, they're gonna need to pay for it, right? Because some of the

1428
01:22:58,405 --> 01:23:01,605
Speaker 15:  stuff that's not at the mass scale yet, it can be substantially more expensive.

1429
01:23:01,625 --> 01:23:05,445
Speaker 15:  So it can be finding that sweet spot of the front edge or certainly

1430
01:23:05,775 --> 01:23:09,685
Speaker 15:  where things are moving. I came across a really great word the other

1431
01:23:09,685 --> 01:23:13,525
Speaker 15:  day called extensibility extensible. It's a

1432
01:23:13,525 --> 01:23:16,485
Speaker 15:  quality of something that's basically future proofing, right? So the cool

1433
01:23:16,485 --> 01:23:20,445
Speaker 15:  thing about USB C is it's extensible. So they have this, this

1434
01:23:20,605 --> 01:23:24,485
Speaker 15:  standard size, it's updating and it's growing right? You know, 4K,

1435
01:23:24,485 --> 01:23:28,205
Speaker 15:  then eight K, and then the high speed data and this and that. So it's cool

1436
01:23:28,275 --> 01:23:31,725
Speaker 15:  that we seem to have come to this standard size that is

1437
01:23:31,725 --> 01:23:35,045
Speaker 15:  extensible and it's growing and it means that for an accessory maker like

1438
01:23:35,045 --> 01:23:38,925
Speaker 15:  ourselves, we have a big pool to play in and

1439
01:23:38,925 --> 01:23:42,605
Speaker 15:  we have a lot of, we can bring forward ideas, we can

1440
01:23:42,615 --> 01:23:46,565
Speaker 15:  adapt, we can update, we can be thinking about power, portable power

1441
01:23:46,795 --> 01:23:50,605
Speaker 15:  data. What if we want an issue where there's not data for security.

1442
01:23:50,605 --> 01:23:52,925
Speaker 15:  Sometimes when you're charging in a public environment, maybe you want to

1443
01:23:52,925 --> 01:23:56,565
Speaker 15:  ensure that data's not going through. It's exciting and interesting and

1444
01:23:56,825 --> 01:24:00,725
Speaker 15:  it means that there's opportunities and challenges for us to build for it.

1445
01:24:00,725 --> 01:24:04,685
Speaker 15:  but it certainly got so many pros and we like that we, we embrace that we,

1446
01:24:05,155 --> 01:24:08,845
Speaker 15:  it's, it's annoying as a customer, as a consumer to have six different cables

1447
01:24:08,845 --> 01:24:12,605
Speaker 15:  and you always seem to have the wrong one. Those days are kind of over

1448
01:24:12,745 --> 01:24:15,045
Speaker 15:  at least largely improved.

1449
01:24:15,555 --> 01:24:19,165
Speaker 7:  I'll give you largely improved I think over is, is hopeful. Like I

1450
01:24:19,205 --> 01:24:21,845
Speaker 6:  Think that's what you gotta take to the holiday table, David. You gotta,

1451
01:24:21,865 --> 01:24:25,525
Speaker 6:  you gotta be like, grandma look, it's largely improved. Do you feel the spirit

1452
01:24:25,585 --> 01:24:26,205
Speaker 6:  of Christmas?

1453
01:24:26,625 --> 01:24:29,525
Speaker 7:  No. To your point, like the thing all of that relies on, and I'm curious

1454
01:24:29,525 --> 01:24:33,285
Speaker 7:  how you feel about this is like getting the connector itself, right? If we're

1455
01:24:33,285 --> 01:24:36,125
Speaker 7:  at a point where it is so sort of futureproof and extensible, like you're

1456
01:24:36,125 --> 01:24:40,045
Speaker 7:  talking about that we won't regret that choice in a decade. A lot

1457
01:24:40,045 --> 01:24:43,005
Speaker 7:  of things will change around it and it like, you know, there will be backwards

1458
01:24:43,005 --> 01:24:46,205
Speaker 7:  compatibility stuff or whatever. But like, do you feel like we got the connector,

1459
01:24:46,205 --> 01:24:49,165
Speaker 7:  right? Like as somebody who works with it all the time, is it, did we do

1460
01:24:49,165 --> 01:24:49,685
Speaker 7:  it correctly?

1461
01:24:50,405 --> 01:24:54,005
Speaker 15:  I feel like we did. I've gotta say when we started in

1462
01:24:54,005 --> 01:24:57,965
Speaker 15:  2012 with our first product charge card, it was a 30 pin adopter

1463
01:24:57,965 --> 01:25:01,525
Speaker 15:  for the iPhone. Okay. So that, I think they switched in 2012 or 2013. So

1464
01:25:01,525 --> 01:25:04,445
Speaker 15:  when we started it was the 2012 and they shifted to lightning and it was,

1465
01:25:04,585 --> 01:25:08,125
Speaker 15:  it was cool, it was good, it was lightning. It was, it was great. What we've

1466
01:25:08,125 --> 01:25:11,125
Speaker 15:  seen, there's been kind of these like, looks like there's kind of a 10 year

1467
01:25:11,125 --> 01:25:14,885
Speaker 15:  window. So does this usher in a 10 year window?

1468
01:25:15,605 --> 01:25:19,485
Speaker 15:  I think that we're at the beginning of a relatively large window.

1469
01:25:19,955 --> 01:25:22,765
Speaker 15:  It's hard to say. I mean it, it makes sense to me that ports would also

1470
01:25:22,765 --> 01:25:26,485
Speaker 15:  stay around for charging. But of course we have the whole component as well

1471
01:25:26,485 --> 01:25:29,845
Speaker 15:  of, of wireless and Q and the QE two standard that's coming out. And does

1472
01:25:29,845 --> 01:25:33,645
Speaker 15:  Apple want to go port list? Do some devices want to go port list

1473
01:25:33,645 --> 01:25:37,405
Speaker 15:  and, and drop the port altogether? It nonetheless remaining the port,

1474
01:25:37,825 --> 01:25:41,765
Speaker 15:  but with some option of of wireless. So from what I've seen,

1475
01:25:41,765 --> 01:25:45,485
Speaker 15:  from what we've seen, it seems like we should probably have a

1476
01:25:45,485 --> 01:25:48,365
Speaker 15:  good 10 year window. These are the types of windows you need for it to be

1477
01:25:48,365 --> 01:25:51,805
Speaker 15:  useful. 'cause otherwise you're on an airplane and then you're like, gosh

1478
01:25:51,875 --> 01:25:52,645
Speaker 15:  darn it. But

1479
01:25:52,645 --> 01:25:56,165
Speaker 6:  Aren't we at the end of the 10 year window, right? USB C hit in what,

1480
01:25:56,165 --> 01:25:56,645
Speaker 6:  2015?

1481
01:25:57,365 --> 01:25:59,965
Speaker 7:  Yeah, there's one version of it that says we're nine years into a 10 year

1482
01:25:59,965 --> 01:26:00,205
Speaker 7:  window.

1483
01:26:00,395 --> 01:26:04,285
Speaker 15:  Yeah, that's, I guess it depends on the, the level of, of the adoption

1484
01:26:04,305 --> 01:26:07,725
Speaker 15:  and the, a big impactor is, look, you know, the United States, the iPhone

1485
01:26:07,725 --> 01:26:11,285
Speaker 15:  is the leading smartphone. It's a leading smartphone globally. They just

1486
01:26:11,285 --> 01:26:14,525
Speaker 15:  took it on this year. I think that's big, that's a big impactor there and

1487
01:26:14,525 --> 01:26:18,365
Speaker 15:  should give us a, a decent window. It's hard to say if they do change, it

1488
01:26:18,365 --> 01:26:19,485
Speaker 15:  will be there. There's

1489
01:26:19,485 --> 01:26:23,405
Speaker 7:  Nobody like telling you about USB D already, right? Like is is this, is

1490
01:26:23,405 --> 01:26:26,045
Speaker 7:  this a thing that's, that's coming next year that we just don't know about

1491
01:26:26,045 --> 01:26:26,245
Speaker 7:  yet?

1492
01:26:26,845 --> 01:26:30,725
Speaker 15:  Gosh, I not hopefully not yet. We, we need give us a little bit of

1493
01:26:30,725 --> 01:26:32,645
Speaker 15:  time to, to get this standard rolled out.

1494
01:26:32,865 --> 01:26:36,725
Speaker 6:  So lemme ask you about Apple actually. I'm always curious to ask accessory

1495
01:26:36,725 --> 01:26:40,285
Speaker 6:  manufacturers this, for the longest time there was lightning

1496
01:26:40,505 --> 01:26:44,325
Speaker 6:  and that was your volume seller, right? You, you pointed out like that's

1497
01:26:44,325 --> 01:26:47,005
Speaker 6:  where all the volume was. That's where people were buying and lightning was

1498
01:26:47,005 --> 01:26:50,765
Speaker 6:  pretty fixed. Like they rolled it out in 2012 or whatever and it never

1499
01:26:50,765 --> 01:26:54,085
Speaker 6:  changed it. It was the thing it was for the whole time. And you were able

1500
01:26:54,085 --> 01:26:57,205
Speaker 6:  to build, build the business around that and mostly it was charging, like

1501
01:26:57,205 --> 01:27:00,965
Speaker 6:  there were just not a lot of like cool computer things you could do with

1502
01:27:01,005 --> 01:27:04,885
Speaker 6:  a lightning port. I had like a, a silly little camera attachment for my iPhone

1503
01:27:04,885 --> 01:27:08,165
Speaker 6:  at one point. But like all this stuff fizzled out. Was that because that's

1504
01:27:08,165 --> 01:27:11,685
Speaker 6:  how Apple wanted it is because you didn't have the market. I always wonder

1505
01:27:12,025 --> 01:27:14,845
Speaker 6:  if that's where all what all the people were buying was lightning accessories.

1506
01:27:15,585 --> 01:27:19,565
Speaker 6:  Why were the only lightning accessories like cables in

1507
01:27:19,565 --> 01:27:21,405
Speaker 6:  battery packs? Why weren't there anything else?

1508
01:27:21,875 --> 01:27:25,445
Speaker 15:  Yeah, it was a very controlled and and somewhat conservative market. So

1509
01:27:25,725 --> 01:27:29,085
Speaker 15:  MFI is made for iPhone, that's the, the Apple sort of

1510
01:27:29,095 --> 01:27:32,885
Speaker 15:  guidelines and program that manages it and it's very clear

1511
01:27:32,985 --> 01:27:36,885
Speaker 15:  and very strict guidelines. There's some wiggle room you could submit

1512
01:27:36,885 --> 01:27:40,125
Speaker 15:  exception requests to to products. We actually had a couple products that

1513
01:27:40,125 --> 01:27:43,165
Speaker 15:  exception requests that had to do largely with the housing that was holding

1514
01:27:43,585 --> 01:27:47,045
Speaker 15:  the connector. So we could make, we made like a carabiner cable. That was

1515
01:27:47,045 --> 01:27:50,565
Speaker 15:  really cool. Cool. We made, we made a, the our key, our little charge key

1516
01:27:50,565 --> 01:27:53,965
Speaker 15:  short cable. So these were, these were not the most, you know, wild

1517
01:27:54,205 --> 01:27:58,085
Speaker 15:  exceptions that are more like a, in a industrial design exception, but it's

1518
01:27:58,085 --> 01:28:01,165
Speaker 15:  very controlled environment. And then you think about female, right? So

1519
01:28:01,315 --> 01:28:04,645
Speaker 15:  when we think of lightning we tend to think of the male as these are the

1520
01:28:04,645 --> 01:28:07,325
Speaker 15:  connectors that you buy and you integrate 'em on cables and this and that.

1521
01:28:07,395 --> 01:28:07,805
Speaker 15:  Well I

1522
01:28:07,805 --> 01:28:10,365
Speaker 6:  Feel like we just need to explain to people Exactly. You mean the part that

1523
01:28:10,365 --> 01:28:13,965
Speaker 6:  you go into, right? There's the plug and there's the socket. And so when

1524
01:28:13,965 --> 01:28:15,405
Speaker 6:  you say female you mean the socket?

1525
01:28:15,745 --> 01:28:19,405
Speaker 15:  The socket. So it was that the very few products had the female

1526
01:28:19,965 --> 01:28:23,925
Speaker 15:  lightning on them from Apple on theirs did, right? The iPhone has

1527
01:28:24,365 --> 01:28:27,645
Speaker 15:  anything that takes takes a lightning or the battery pack for example,

1528
01:28:27,955 --> 01:28:31,845
Speaker 15:  lightning was really, generally speaking was really a male

1529
01:28:32,195 --> 01:28:35,765
Speaker 15:  program, right? It was really just a little, the connector plug that goes

1530
01:28:35,765 --> 01:28:39,565
Speaker 15:  in when you think of USB C, it's, it's double universal, right? It, it turns

1531
01:28:39,565 --> 01:28:42,765
Speaker 15:  around it's 306, you can turn it on both sides. Lightning did that too,

1532
01:28:42,765 --> 01:28:46,085
Speaker 15:  of course. But both ends can go both ways. It's actually one of the things

1533
01:28:46,085 --> 01:28:49,805
Speaker 15:  that I'm really excited about is, is that they've enabled reverse charging.

1534
01:28:50,145 --> 01:28:53,645
Speaker 15:  And I know I get in trouble in these things. I say like, you know, the iPhone

1535
01:28:53,645 --> 01:28:56,405
Speaker 15:  did this. It's like, yeah, well the Android did that years ago. I know,

1536
01:28:56,605 --> 01:29:00,405
Speaker 15:  I know it's still, yeah and it's so amazing now in USB C because it can

1537
01:29:00,405 --> 01:29:03,405
Speaker 15:  go both ways. So you know, you're out at the bar and your phone's dead,

1538
01:29:03,405 --> 01:29:06,725
Speaker 15:  you buy someone a beer, you charge your phone from their phone or vice versa.

1539
01:29:06,825 --> 01:29:09,605
Speaker 15:  So if you're irresponsible and your battery's dead, you need one of these

1540
01:29:09,605 --> 01:29:12,805
Speaker 15:  on these. If you're responsible, you you need one of these on you so you

1541
01:29:12,805 --> 01:29:16,405
Speaker 15:  can charge other people. So, so there's just cool stuff going on

1542
01:29:16,635 --> 01:29:20,445
Speaker 15:  with with USB C And so there's things like that that

1543
01:29:20,575 --> 01:29:23,165
Speaker 15:  never were really part of the lightning thing 'cause it wasn't going both

1544
01:29:23,165 --> 01:29:26,605
Speaker 15:  ways. So there's things like that that just make it better and

1545
01:29:27,165 --> 01:29:30,405
Speaker 15:  interesting and again confusing. Yeah, right. If we put power in the mix,

1546
01:29:30,405 --> 01:29:33,125
Speaker 15:  which way is it going? What's charging what, you know, you need to kind

1547
01:29:33,125 --> 01:29:36,525
Speaker 15:  of choose on the phone or does it just go out If it's to the AirPods, it's

1548
01:29:36,525 --> 01:29:39,405
Speaker 15:  just going out. You're not charging the phone from the AirPods. But interesting

1549
01:29:39,405 --> 01:29:39,805
Speaker 15:  stuff there.

1550
01:29:40,075 --> 01:29:43,525
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Well and even beyond just charging, it seems like one of the things

1551
01:29:43,545 --> 01:29:47,405
Speaker 7:  we were amazed by with the iPhone was how not locked down

1552
01:29:48,065 --> 01:29:51,885
Speaker 7:  its USB C setup is, you can just plug most things into it.

1553
01:29:52,405 --> 01:29:55,285
Speaker 7:  Some of them work, some of them don't. But we were sort of consistently surprised

1554
01:29:55,825 --> 01:29:59,325
Speaker 7:  by the number of like computery accessories that suddenly worked with the

1555
01:29:59,325 --> 01:30:02,445
Speaker 7:  iPhone. Yeah. And I feel like for you, you're now in this position where

1556
01:30:02,445 --> 01:30:06,205
Speaker 7:  you can build one set of accessories that works with iPhones, which

1557
01:30:06,225 --> 01:30:09,405
Speaker 7:  are obvi, it sounds like the majority of your customers, but also with the

1558
01:30:09,405 --> 01:30:13,285
Speaker 7:  whole universe of Android phones. And then also do this gigantic

1559
01:30:13,425 --> 01:30:17,125
Speaker 7:  set of things that you've never been able to do before with accessories.

1560
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:20,525
Speaker 7:  Like has it changed the list of things you feel like you can build

1561
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:24,045
Speaker 7:  just because it is this universal port that theoretically you can plug almost

1562
01:30:24,285 --> 01:30:25,485
Speaker 7:  anything into and it'll do something.

1563
01:30:26,325 --> 01:30:30,165
Speaker 15:  Absolutely. A, from a technical standpoint and b, from an like

1564
01:30:30,665 --> 01:30:34,485
Speaker 15:  now we have the opportunity to do it standpoint. Meaning now that everyone's

1565
01:30:34,645 --> 01:30:38,565
Speaker 15:  together, one of my best friends is a diehard Android user and when we

1566
01:30:38,685 --> 01:30:41,685
Speaker 15:  launched this charge key, he sent me a message, he bought five and he said,

1567
01:30:41,865 --> 01:30:45,325
Speaker 15:  you finally made something for Android. And of course, of course I'm

1568
01:30:45,325 --> 01:30:46,405
Speaker 7:  Thinking and you're like sort of, yeah,

1569
01:30:46,665 --> 01:30:49,805
Speaker 15:  Of course I'm thinking like, dude, we've been making the best cables for

1570
01:30:49,965 --> 01:30:53,845
Speaker 15:  USB C for years. But it's true. We are la largely iPhone.

1571
01:30:53,945 --> 01:30:57,165
Speaker 15:  So from a customer base standpoint, so, so it's huge for us. And I just

1572
01:30:57,165 --> 01:31:00,125
Speaker 15:  say that because we we're all about building portable power, keeping you

1573
01:31:00,125 --> 01:31:03,125
Speaker 15:  charged on the go, keeping you protected on the go with our cases and so

1574
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:06,845
Speaker 15:  forth. But we've, it's always been part of us. And now though that it's

1575
01:31:06,915 --> 01:31:10,605
Speaker 15:  obviously like this cable without question thought that there's two models

1576
01:31:10,825 --> 01:31:14,645
Speaker 15:  and one sells more than the other. There's one model and it goes to

1577
01:31:15,245 --> 01:31:18,805
Speaker 15:  everyone. That's huge for us. I mean, from a, from a research and development

1578
01:31:18,805 --> 01:31:22,565
Speaker 15:  standpoint, it means let's probably invest more into this

1579
01:31:22,565 --> 01:31:25,805
Speaker 15:  because we don't have to build two of them or we don't have to make a judgment

1580
01:31:25,875 --> 01:31:29,845
Speaker 15:  call. Is there a market for this one? So it's, it's incredible from

1581
01:31:29,845 --> 01:31:32,925
Speaker 15:  that standpoint. We have a lot of great ideas brewing right now. We have

1582
01:31:32,925 --> 01:31:35,725
Speaker 15:  a couple products that are in development that, that are gonna be released

1583
01:31:35,725 --> 01:31:39,365
Speaker 15:  in 2024 that I think are a little bit ahead of their time, if not early.

1584
01:31:39,455 --> 01:31:43,405
Speaker 15:  We're trying to, there's a challenge that it poses as well is the apple

1585
01:31:43,405 --> 01:31:46,925
Speaker 15:  lightning ecosystem was a protected kind of

1586
01:31:46,925 --> 01:31:50,525
Speaker 15:  ecosystem, right? You, you see products at gas stations so forth that were

1587
01:31:50,525 --> 01:31:54,165
Speaker 15:  non MFI, right? But if generally a customer wants to buy

1588
01:31:54,165 --> 01:31:57,685
Speaker 15:  something, if you're buying quality product, it's MFI. So it was a

1589
01:31:57,685 --> 01:32:01,045
Speaker 15:  controlled environment. So while there were all these annoying rules and

1590
01:32:01,045 --> 01:32:04,645
Speaker 15:  stuff, it was a safe environment. one of the challenges at USB C

1591
01:32:05,185 --> 01:32:08,405
Speaker 15:  is there's less of that, right? So you go to the gas station, how do you

1592
01:32:08,405 --> 01:32:12,365
Speaker 15:  know that that $5 cable is good? Well if you're buying

1593
01:32:12,405 --> 01:32:16,125
Speaker 15:  a MFI lightning cable, it costs a lot of money. 20 or

1594
01:32:16,125 --> 01:32:19,845
Speaker 15:  $30. But the components are coming through the, from the Apple

1595
01:32:19,875 --> 01:32:23,405
Speaker 15:  ecosystem. So these are gonna be challenges that we face from a,

1596
01:32:23,835 --> 01:32:27,725
Speaker 15:  what you had mentioned earlier about the standard in marketing

1597
01:32:27,725 --> 01:32:30,445
Speaker 15:  and these key terms and buzzwords, but the, these are gonna be challenges

1598
01:32:30,445 --> 01:32:33,365
Speaker 15:  that we face. And so from, from our side, that's, I can already see that,

1599
01:32:33,365 --> 01:32:37,045
Speaker 15:  that there's gonna be a little bit of a, some fun coming to together

1600
01:32:37,225 --> 01:32:41,165
Speaker 15:  and hopefully some things do prevail, some, some solid standards and and

1601
01:32:41,165 --> 01:32:44,325
Speaker 15:  so forth. So we can give clarity to customers and what they're buying and,

1602
01:32:44,345 --> 01:32:45,925
Speaker 15:  and what they can expect from the products.

1603
01:32:46,195 --> 01:32:49,925
Speaker 6:  With all that extra, you know, resource available for research and development,

1604
01:32:49,925 --> 01:32:53,645
Speaker 6:  do you, do you see more and different kinds of USB c accessories

1605
01:32:53,645 --> 01:32:54,525
Speaker 6:  coming out now?

1606
01:32:55,075 --> 01:32:58,685
Speaker 15:  Yeah, great question. I mean, having a cable on you at all times becomes

1607
01:32:59,235 --> 01:33:03,205
Speaker 15:  more important than ever before. So, so perhaps portable

1608
01:33:03,545 --> 01:33:07,205
Speaker 15:  cables portability could be, could be more important. Especially as there's

1609
01:33:07,205 --> 01:33:10,485
Speaker 15:  this universality, it's like there's way more reasons for why you would

1610
01:33:10,485 --> 01:33:13,605
Speaker 15:  need it before. Do you wanna bring a cable with you? You might use it for

1611
01:33:13,605 --> 01:33:16,685
Speaker 15:  one use case, then you need another cable for another use case that, that's

1612
01:33:16,685 --> 01:33:20,285
Speaker 15:  kind of annoying. So So I think we're gonna see more

1613
01:33:20,465 --> 01:33:24,205
Speaker 15:  things like that. More, more portable cables and perhaps just

1614
01:33:24,455 --> 01:33:28,045
Speaker 15:  maybe some higher quality cables where you're investing in a, because you

1615
01:33:28,045 --> 01:33:30,805
Speaker 15:  know, before you're so annoyed, you know, you've already bought 20 cables,

1616
01:33:30,805 --> 01:33:34,125
Speaker 15:  you have a drawer in your desk filled with random cables, you know, you

1617
01:33:34,125 --> 01:33:37,765
Speaker 15:  don't, the last thing you wanna do is spend $30 on a cable and now it's

1618
01:33:37,765 --> 01:33:41,725
Speaker 15:  like, hey, do the research. There's a really incredible high

1619
01:33:41,725 --> 01:33:45,165
Speaker 15:  speed data cable. I think it's the thunderbolt one from, from Apple out

1620
01:33:45,165 --> 01:33:49,045
Speaker 15:  there. 240 watts. Yeah, this and that. Just, it's nice to know that

1621
01:33:49,045 --> 01:33:52,205
Speaker 15:  that's gonna be around for a while and it's gonna have so much universality

1622
01:33:52,345 --> 01:33:55,845
Speaker 15:  in, in usefulness. So it could be worth investing. We, we have Kevlar on

1623
01:33:55,845 --> 01:33:58,845
Speaker 15:  our cables, you know, that's coming from DuPont light. It's a license thing.

1624
01:33:58,875 --> 01:34:02,245
Speaker 15:  It's like the real deal. So our cables aren't cheap, but they're really

1625
01:34:02,245 --> 01:34:06,205
Speaker 15:  well made. We have metal tips to them. So, I could understand why

1626
01:34:06,205 --> 01:34:09,365
Speaker 15:  someone would be annoyed a few years ago and they just wanna buy the cheapest

1627
01:34:09,365 --> 01:34:12,045
Speaker 15:  cable possible. 'cause A, it might break on them. B, the standards are changing.

1628
01:34:12,245 --> 01:34:15,525
Speaker 15:  C they need to have five different cables. But now with one you can be a

1629
01:34:15,525 --> 01:34:16,645
Speaker 15:  little more thoughtful about it.

1630
01:34:16,955 --> 01:34:19,445
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Do you think I, I was gonna ask you about the Kevlar cables because

1631
01:34:19,465 --> 01:34:23,405
Speaker 7:  you were, you were early to the idea of what I would call a ludicrously fancy

1632
01:34:23,885 --> 01:34:27,045
Speaker 7:  charging cable. Like the, the Kevlar stuff you started doing like in 2019

1633
01:34:27,445 --> 01:34:30,605
Speaker 7:  I think, right? That's which is like ancient history in the charging cable

1634
01:34:30,925 --> 01:34:34,085
Speaker 7:  universe. But I think the idea that you should eventually

1635
01:34:34,655 --> 01:34:38,565
Speaker 7:  carry the one sort of the cable that charges the hardest

1636
01:34:38,615 --> 01:34:41,845
Speaker 7:  thing you have to charge and then kind of scales down to everything else

1637
01:34:41,845 --> 01:34:45,085
Speaker 7:  like that seems like where we have to get in this crazy

1638
01:34:45,535 --> 01:34:48,245
Speaker 7:  world of charging that we're gonna get into that you either carry a bunch

1639
01:34:48,245 --> 01:34:52,205
Speaker 7:  of different USB c cables or you carry like the one, like the

1640
01:34:52,205 --> 01:34:55,005
Speaker 7:  epic cable. Yeah. God cable, right? The God cable.

1641
01:34:55,395 --> 01:34:58,005
Speaker 6:  It's Christmas, it arrives in a virgin birth.

1642
01:34:58,675 --> 01:34:58,965
Speaker 15:  Yeah.

1643
01:34:59,385 --> 01:35:01,485
Speaker 6:  I'm trying to make the Christmas jokes as much as I could.

1644
01:35:02,625 --> 01:35:05,365
Speaker 15:  So the the just the universal best cable, we're

1645
01:35:05,365 --> 01:35:07,925
Speaker 7:  Calling it the God cable. Cable. It's now officially known as God cable.

1646
01:35:07,925 --> 01:35:09,485
Speaker 7:  Cable. Like is the god cable gonna be a thing?

1647
01:35:09,755 --> 01:35:12,765
Speaker 15:  Well I guess the God cable is kind of,

1648
01:35:13,025 --> 01:35:14,765
Speaker 7:  We already made it a thing. It happened already. This is great.

1649
01:35:15,025 --> 01:35:18,925
Speaker 15:  The USB C cable and I mean I would argue I can't, I can't, I love

1650
01:35:18,925 --> 01:35:22,725
Speaker 15:  this product. It's the best. Cable is the one you have on you So. I

1651
01:35:22,725 --> 01:35:26,645
Speaker 15:  love our chart, our charge key because the best cable is with you when you

1652
01:35:26,645 --> 01:35:26,885
Speaker 15:  need it.

1653
01:35:26,945 --> 01:35:29,725
Speaker 7:  But isn't that the problem with USB C is that that's not necessarily true

1654
01:35:29,725 --> 01:35:30,165
Speaker 7:  anymore?

1655
01:35:30,315 --> 01:35:33,325
Speaker 6:  Yeah. How fast is the charge key? You love it. It's great. I mean I understand

1656
01:35:33,325 --> 01:35:36,925
Speaker 6:  why you like it. Can it charge my MacBook at a hundred watts?

1657
01:35:37,275 --> 01:35:40,405
Speaker 15:  Ours, right? This version right here will just charge up to 60 watts, but

1658
01:35:40,405 --> 01:35:43,685
Speaker 15:  we're probably gonna increase the speed. So go a hundred. The MacBook Air

1659
01:35:43,795 --> 01:35:47,125
Speaker 15:  tops out at I think 35 watts. So 60 alone. You're charging

1660
01:35:47,585 --> 01:35:49,445
Speaker 15:  really, really high speed. I

1661
01:35:49,445 --> 01:35:50,725
Speaker 6:  Gotta run these M1 ultras dog.

1662
01:35:51,415 --> 01:35:53,205
Speaker 15:  We're we're coming, we're coming for it.

1663
01:35:53,705 --> 01:35:56,045
Speaker 6:  So there, there's something else happening there. You mentioned it before,

1664
01:35:56,045 --> 01:35:59,885
Speaker 6:  which is MagSafe Q2 just to make this stuff. There's a whole

1665
01:35:59,885 --> 01:36:03,245
Speaker 6:  bunch of really hardcore engineering probably for you, a bunch of supplier

1666
01:36:03,255 --> 01:36:07,205
Speaker 6:  deals, right? The, the bleeding edge of USB power is all in GaN

1667
01:36:07,225 --> 01:36:10,805
Speaker 6:  and getting supply of GaN chips in Q2.

1668
01:36:11,025 --> 01:36:14,805
Speaker 6:  I'm sure that the supplier base of people actually making Q2 stuff is pretty

1669
01:36:14,805 --> 01:36:18,085
Speaker 6:  limited right now. Let's start with GaN that's what you, you need to have

1670
01:36:18,085 --> 01:36:21,525
Speaker 6:  in order to build the most powerful USB C stuff. How does that market work?

1671
01:36:21,585 --> 01:36:24,885
Speaker 6:  Are you in it? Do you have exclusives? Do you have to fight off other vendors?

1672
01:36:25,195 --> 01:36:29,085
Speaker 15:  Yeah, so gam, gallium nitride is the kind of the high speed

1673
01:36:29,535 --> 01:36:33,525
Speaker 15:  dents sort of compact, high speed standard I guess, I guess you could

1674
01:36:33,525 --> 01:36:37,405
Speaker 15:  say when you're doing these things at first, earlier on, it's gonna

1675
01:36:37,405 --> 01:36:40,645
Speaker 15:  be more expensive. So back to your point on the supply chain and the suppliers

1676
01:36:40,645 --> 01:36:44,525
Speaker 15:  and contract manufacturers, they're pretty on this stuff. So we're

1677
01:36:44,525 --> 01:36:48,405
Speaker 15:  usually one of the early companies to be excited and be pushing the

1678
01:36:48,405 --> 01:36:51,565
Speaker 15:  boundaries of those things. And for GaN that was,

1679
01:36:52,115 --> 01:36:55,845
Speaker 15:  that was a couple years ago where it was more really on the forefront. It's

1680
01:36:55,845 --> 01:36:59,685
Speaker 15:  certainly become the kind of premium commodity tech let's say.

1681
01:36:59,885 --> 01:37:02,765
Speaker 15:  'cause there's still plenty of stuff out there that that's not, and and

1682
01:37:02,765 --> 01:37:05,365
Speaker 15:  it, it's gonna be, it's gonna be less expensive. It's gonna be bulkier.

1683
01:37:05,465 --> 01:37:08,645
Speaker 15:  And when you think about costs as well in supply chain, there's the cost

1684
01:37:08,645 --> 01:37:12,045
Speaker 15:  of freight and air freight and shipping. So it depends.

1685
01:37:12,625 --> 01:37:16,245
Speaker 6:  What's the thing you want to build that you can't now, but

1686
01:37:16,425 --> 01:37:18,965
Speaker 6:  the next rev of GaN would let you build?

1687
01:37:19,715 --> 01:37:23,605
Speaker 15:  Well, I would love to go, we even really compact so

1688
01:37:23,605 --> 01:37:26,685
Speaker 15:  we could have the AC to C

1689
01:37:27,055 --> 01:37:31,045
Speaker 15:  integrated, right? So AC 120 volt in or

1690
01:37:31,045 --> 01:37:34,925
Speaker 15:  or up to 40 whatever for Europe, other places AC to

1691
01:37:35,525 --> 01:37:39,325
Speaker 15:  C, extremely compact. Extremely

1692
01:37:39,325 --> 01:37:43,245
Speaker 15:  compact. So hyperact, so it's so small it, it fits on your key chain.

1693
01:37:43,245 --> 01:37:47,205
Speaker 15:  It's, and it's smaller than a, than a key fob. So it's kind

1694
01:37:47,205 --> 01:37:50,125
Speaker 15:  of like game over with this you can charge,

1695
01:37:50,385 --> 01:37:52,205
Speaker 6:  You just have a wall plug on your key chain.

1696
01:37:52,385 --> 01:37:55,685
Speaker 15:  But it's so tiny that it's elegant, right? We don't wanna be carrying around

1697
01:37:55,725 --> 01:37:57,325
Speaker 15:  a punky brick with us.

1698
01:37:57,725 --> 01:38:00,845
Speaker 6:  I love this answer. This is completely not what I was expecting. I love that

1699
01:38:00,845 --> 01:38:04,525
Speaker 6:  I'm, I was a straight one 10 plug on a key chain is what you're after.

1700
01:38:04,745 --> 01:38:08,645
Speaker 15:  You're like where's my 200 like crazy charger thing? Yeah, I was

1701
01:38:08,645 --> 01:38:12,605
Speaker 6:  Like 200,000 watts. Let's go like, like

1702
01:38:12,605 --> 01:38:16,525
Speaker 6:  you can plug a Tesla into a USB C like and you're like, here's what I

1703
01:38:16,525 --> 01:38:19,445
Speaker 6:  want like a wall plug. Like, but that's actually really interesting to think

1704
01:38:19,445 --> 01:38:22,685
Speaker 6:  about it that if that's what you can stretch out to, we're kind of just back

1705
01:38:22,905 --> 01:38:24,685
Speaker 6:  to having power cables.

1706
01:38:24,835 --> 01:38:25,125
Speaker 15:  Yeah,

1707
01:38:25,495 --> 01:38:29,445
Speaker 6:  Right. Only this is a power cable that has intelligence in it's a self negotiator

1708
01:38:29,445 --> 01:38:33,325
Speaker 6:  rate. Like we are just back to power cables is that like I I don

1709
01:38:33,325 --> 01:38:36,685
Speaker 6:  know I bought a power strip for $7 yesterday. It's a real thing that happened

1710
01:38:36,825 --> 01:38:40,725
Speaker 6:  and I did not think, I mean maybe you should not buy one that

1711
01:38:40,725 --> 01:38:43,245
Speaker 6:  you're gonna run too many amps on, but like most people do not think about

1712
01:38:43,765 --> 01:38:46,125
Speaker 6:  a power strip. They're like, I'm gonna buy a power strip, it's gonna have

1713
01:38:46,125 --> 01:38:49,285
Speaker 6:  six plugs in it. Hopefully I can fiddle my wall warts on it and that's how

1714
01:38:49,285 --> 01:38:52,965
Speaker 6:  I'm gonna evaluate this power strip. And you don't think about charging speeds

1715
01:38:53,025 --> 01:38:56,605
Speaker 6:  or delivery with USB. You have to, and

1716
01:38:56,825 --> 01:39:00,405
Speaker 6:  yet USB C is gonna become the power cable for the world. Are we gonna get

1717
01:39:00,405 --> 01:39:03,725
Speaker 6:  to a place where we can, we can just stop thinking about it that way because

1718
01:39:04,105 --> 01:39:06,965
Speaker 6:  you're gonna integrate a regular power plug on the end and we'll just negotiate

1719
01:39:06,965 --> 01:39:09,485
Speaker 6:  it intelligently. Like how is that gonna play out?

1720
01:39:10,075 --> 01:39:13,205
Speaker 15:  Yeah. Well you've got me thinking to to your previous question as well is

1721
01:39:13,585 --> 01:39:17,125
Speaker 15:  I'm just really hopeful that it becomes as universal

1722
01:39:17,385 --> 01:39:21,045
Speaker 15:  as it can become. I'm just thinking about all the products that we have

1723
01:39:21,045 --> 01:39:24,845
Speaker 15:  that don't use USB C but do use their own AC to DC wall wart thing and

1724
01:39:24,845 --> 01:39:27,965
Speaker 15:  you're plugging in the barrel connector, it's called the little circular

1725
01:39:28,715 --> 01:39:32,685
Speaker 15:  plug. And think of your, your Dyson vacuum cleaner, your,

1726
01:39:32,945 --> 01:39:35,925
Speaker 15:  you know, any, it's certain mini household products, et cetera. So we still

1727
01:39:35,925 --> 01:39:39,805
Speaker 15:  have so many products out there that are using all their weird little

1728
01:39:39,815 --> 01:39:42,885
Speaker 15:  power systems. And then if you lose the thing You don't know, I have a charger,

1729
01:39:43,005 --> 01:39:46,965
Speaker 15:  I have a little air pump like mattress, air inflator thing and I can't remember

1730
01:39:46,965 --> 01:39:50,565
Speaker 15:  where I put that barrel plug. And I like don't buy things if they don't

1731
01:39:50,565 --> 01:39:54,205
Speaker 15:  have USB C, if they could have USB C I've been waiting for years to

1732
01:39:54,505 --> 01:39:58,325
Speaker 15:  do USB C electric shaver. So there's all these household

1733
01:39:58,325 --> 01:40:01,485
Speaker 15:  items and all these things that I'm excited for it to it to come to it.

1734
01:40:01,545 --> 01:40:05,365
Speaker 15:  And as that happens, like back to your point on what's your like dream build

1735
01:40:05,765 --> 01:40:09,645
Speaker 15:  I guess like don don't know maybe as well, again really boring answer, but

1736
01:40:10,085 --> 01:40:13,845
Speaker 15:  building the cables that can supply the wattage for these

1737
01:40:13,845 --> 01:40:17,605
Speaker 15:  household appliances and devices that might take a higher

1738
01:40:17,715 --> 01:40:21,445
Speaker 15:  wattage to charge, because I don't want to have still,

1739
01:40:21,715 --> 01:40:25,645
Speaker 15:  when, when you look at even that US BBC's become universal for all of

1740
01:40:25,645 --> 01:40:29,565
Speaker 15:  our portable electronics and so forth, it's not quite universal on

1741
01:40:29,795 --> 01:40:33,765
Speaker 15:  household appliances and all these other things that are running

1742
01:40:33,765 --> 01:40:37,165
Speaker 15:  on DC anyways and probably should go USB c And sometimes the, the, the supply

1743
01:40:37,165 --> 01:40:40,085
Speaker 15:  chain there can be slow to change. I'm sure we all have had the experience

1744
01:40:40,085 --> 01:40:43,685
Speaker 15:  where you bought something and you're like, wait, it's still using

1745
01:40:43,795 --> 01:40:47,365
Speaker 15:  that cable. Yeah. You know, I'm using a mic. Granted it's an older one right

1746
01:40:47,365 --> 01:40:51,165
Speaker 15:  now and it has a mini USB on it, and it's really high quality

1747
01:40:51,225 --> 01:40:54,445
Speaker 15:  mic. It's from, it's from years ago. But even when I got it, it was, we,

1748
01:40:54,445 --> 01:40:58,245
Speaker 15:  when we got it, it was weird that it had the mini on it. So, so

1749
01:40:58,245 --> 01:41:01,085
Speaker 15:  sometimes things can take a while in the deep supply chain. You might go

1750
01:41:01,355 --> 01:41:05,165
Speaker 15:  into REI to buy a, a light, a camping light, and it might still have micro.

1751
01:41:05,505 --> 01:41:09,045
Speaker 15:  And I'm at a point where I'm not buying that. Like i, I am gonna, unless

1752
01:41:09,045 --> 01:41:12,605
Speaker 15:  it's the only one of its kind, it's just, it's gotta be USB. C

1753
01:41:13,385 --> 01:41:17,325
Speaker 7:  One of the things I've been wondering is as we get to that

1754
01:41:17,445 --> 01:41:21,085
Speaker 7:  universality, like the, the sort of addressable market of everything, USB

1755
01:41:21,125 --> 01:41:24,765
Speaker 7:  C goes up in a really big way now that it's kind of universal and available

1756
01:41:24,765 --> 01:41:28,605
Speaker 7:  to everybody. Like everybody's just gonna have USB C stuff. And part of what

1757
01:41:28,605 --> 01:41:31,925
Speaker 7:  that makes me wonder is if like you're talking about these sort of super

1758
01:41:32,095 --> 01:41:36,005
Speaker 7:  niche accessories can start to come back, right? Like I feel

1759
01:41:36,005 --> 01:41:39,845
Speaker 7:  like especially in the electronic space, you can spend an outrageous amount

1760
01:41:39,845 --> 01:41:43,245
Speaker 7:  of money on like a really fancy case for your iPhone. And that's about it.

1761
01:41:43,305 --> 01:41:46,525
Speaker 7:  And I now wonder if like, if Neli is gonna be able to get

1762
01:41:47,185 --> 01:41:50,805
Speaker 7:  his ultra fancy many thousands of dollars

1763
01:41:50,965 --> 01:41:54,765
Speaker 7:  multi-device charger, because there aren't tons of people in the world

1764
01:41:54,985 --> 01:41:58,365
Speaker 7:  who would buy that, but there's just enough. And now they all can totally

1765
01:41:58,685 --> 01:42:01,925
Speaker 7:  'cause it's USB C and I wonder like, are we gonna, all of the stuff that's

1766
01:42:01,925 --> 01:42:05,445
Speaker 7:  been out there until now has been sort of mainstream on purpose because you

1767
01:42:05,445 --> 01:42:09,405
Speaker 7:  have to be in order to sort of be accessible to people who would buy

1768
01:42:09,405 --> 01:42:12,405
Speaker 7:  this thing. But now I wonder the market is just so much bigger if it's just

1769
01:42:12,405 --> 01:42:16,085
Speaker 7:  gonna get much weirder and nicher and fancier and more luxurious.

1770
01:42:16,545 --> 01:42:19,245
Speaker 7:  And part of that is what's really exciting to me that we're gonna get to

1771
01:42:19,245 --> 01:42:23,005
Speaker 7:  like the speaker market, right? Where it's like you can buy the $20 speakers

1772
01:42:23,005 --> 01:42:26,525
Speaker 7:  everybody has, but you can also spend 50 grand on a pair of speakers if you

1773
01:42:26,525 --> 01:42:29,285
Speaker 7:  really want to. And there's just enough people in the world for that, that

1774
01:42:29,285 --> 01:42:31,565
Speaker 7:  It works. And like, I wonder if we're gonna get there with some of these

1775
01:42:31,565 --> 01:42:33,005
Speaker 7:  accessories too. I kind of hope So

1776
01:42:33,565 --> 01:42:37,165
Speaker 15:  I Hope. So I. Imagine it's coming. I was just chatting the other day with

1777
01:42:37,165 --> 01:42:41,045
Speaker 15:  our supply chain director, a guy named Darren Total audio file and

1778
01:42:41,345 --> 01:42:45,205
Speaker 15:  spends a good chunk of his paycheck going into these really

1779
01:42:45,315 --> 01:42:46,245
Speaker 15:  nice speakers.

1780
01:42:46,505 --> 01:42:48,885
Speaker 6:  I'm with you Dan, let's hang, let's hang buddy. Our people

1781
01:42:49,345 --> 01:42:53,245
Speaker 15:  And I was buying Monitor British company and just

1782
01:42:53,345 --> 01:42:57,045
Speaker 15:  really beautiful work that they do on their, on the, the, the

1783
01:42:57,045 --> 01:43:00,965
Speaker 15:  metals and the housings and in industrial design just kind of, kind of

1784
01:43:00,985 --> 01:43:03,245
Speaker 15:  in that really upper level category.

1785
01:43:03,545 --> 01:43:06,885
Speaker 6:  My, my left rights and centers are monitored. I'm with you Darren. We we

1786
01:43:06,885 --> 01:43:07,405
Speaker 6:  vibe baby.

1787
01:43:07,945 --> 01:43:11,445
Speaker 15:  You guys would love it. And he, it was, it was just funny looking at it

1788
01:43:11,445 --> 01:43:14,125
Speaker 15:  and he was getting all excited about these details. And I could just imagine

1789
01:43:14,345 --> 01:43:18,085
Speaker 15:  so many companies who are in the broader electronics

1790
01:43:18,085 --> 01:43:21,125
Speaker 15:  speaker, consumer space, you know, companies that have been around for a

1791
01:43:21,365 --> 01:43:24,685
Speaker 15:  while have really high standards, build really goals. Cool stuff. This is

1792
01:43:24,685 --> 01:43:27,885
Speaker 15:  an opportunity for them to go, oh, okay. That, that thing finally settled,

1793
01:43:28,065 --> 01:43:31,645
Speaker 15:  all that bs of all the different cables and this and that. And granted before

1794
01:43:31,645 --> 01:43:34,885
Speaker 15:  the cables, not only were there different standards, they didn't have the

1795
01:43:34,885 --> 01:43:38,725
Speaker 15:  capabilities that USB c has. USB c has a lot of capabilities.

1796
01:43:38,785 --> 01:43:42,365
Speaker 15:  So like I was saying, we just got some new monitors in the office and

1797
01:43:42,555 --> 01:43:46,445
Speaker 15:  instead we can now get USB c cables for them or, or

1798
01:43:46,565 --> 01:43:50,445
Speaker 15:  USB, C-H-D-M-I cables because I'm sort of sick of the whole HDMI thing

1799
01:43:50,445 --> 01:43:54,125
Speaker 15:  too. So it's just really cool what what can happen. And I do

1800
01:43:54,125 --> 01:43:57,965
Speaker 15:  think that with more universality, it opens the opportunity for people

1801
01:43:57,985 --> 01:44:01,405
Speaker 15:  to take it seriously and for, to jump in and to build really cool stuff.

1802
01:44:01,525 --> 01:44:04,525
Speaker 15:  I hope that Nomad can continue to be one of those. And I expect we're gonna

1803
01:44:04,525 --> 01:44:08,245
Speaker 15:  see some high-end competition and it'll help us help keep us sharp and

1804
01:44:08,475 --> 01:44:12,365
Speaker 15:  neli. I I think we're gonna, if we don't make it granted we

1805
01:44:12,365 --> 01:44:14,445
Speaker 15:  got some cool stuff in the works. I think we're gonna be seeing stuff like

1806
01:44:14,445 --> 01:44:17,765
Speaker 15:  that out there. And we're, and and that's totally up our alley too. So I.

1807
01:44:17,765 --> 01:44:20,885
Speaker 6:  Love it. All, right now we gotta let you go. I gotta say in the, in the spirit

1808
