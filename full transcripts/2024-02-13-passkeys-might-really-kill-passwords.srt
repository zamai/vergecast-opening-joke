00:00:02,555 --> 00:00:06,445
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of video podcasts.

3
00:00:06,745 --> 00:00:09,925
Speaker 2:  I'm your friend David Pierce, and if you're watching this on YouTube, there's

4
00:00:09,925 --> 00:00:12,885
Speaker 2:  a decent chance you're noticing something slightly different for one of our

5
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:16,805
Speaker 2:  Tuesday episodes, which is my face. So we just finished moving the show from

6
00:00:16,865 --> 00:00:20,405
Speaker 2:  The Vergecast channel to the Verges channel, and you should stay

7
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:23,725
Speaker 2:  subscribed on The Vergecast channel. By the way, we're gonna do clips there

8
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:27,245
Speaker 2:  and some extras and maybe even some live stuff over time. We have big plans

9
00:00:27,245 --> 00:00:31,045
Speaker 2:  for that channel. But for the main episodes, Tuesdays and Fridays, stay

10
00:00:31,045 --> 00:00:34,125
Speaker 2:  tuned to the Verges channel. You can Subscribe to the channel, you can Subscribe

11
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:37,445
Speaker 2:  in YouTube music, you can Subscribe to the podcast playlist specifically.

12
00:00:37,985 --> 00:00:41,325
Speaker 2:  The world is your oyster. It should be very easy. I know we had some migration

13
00:00:41,325 --> 00:00:44,205
Speaker 2:  issues the last few days, but I think those are solved now. And if they're

14
00:00:44,205 --> 00:00:47,125
Speaker 2:  not, send us an email Vergecast at The Verge dot com, we'll get it fixed.

15
00:00:47,385 --> 00:00:50,125
Speaker 2:  Oh, and by the way, if you're like, what are you talking about? I listen

16
00:00:50,145 --> 00:00:54,125
Speaker 2:  to podcasts because people listen to podcasts and I have a podcast app and

17
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:57,365
Speaker 2:  I've never seen David's face and I don't ever wanna see David's face. Totally

18
00:00:57,395 --> 00:01:00,965
Speaker 2:  fine. I get that all the time. Nothing should change. Everything will be

19
00:01:00,965 --> 00:01:04,485
Speaker 2:  as normal, so don't worry. Alright, that's enough housekeeping for now. Let's

20
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:08,085
Speaker 2:  just get into the show. We're gonna do two things on today's episode. First,

21
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:11,485
Speaker 2:  we're gonna talk about pass keys, which are the supposedly revolutionary

22
00:01:11,485 --> 00:01:15,365
Speaker 2:  technology that is going to make being online easier and simpler and more

23
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:19,005
Speaker 2:  secure all at the same time. It's very cool, it's growing really fast and

24
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:22,965
Speaker 2:  I have realized I don't understand Passkeys like at all. So we

25
00:01:22,965 --> 00:01:25,925
Speaker 2:  found somebody who does and we're gonna figure it out together. Then we're

26
00:01:25,925 --> 00:01:29,885
Speaker 2:  gonna talk about wearables and the idea that wearables are just

27
00:01:29,885 --> 00:01:33,725
Speaker 2:  smartwatches feels wrong to me. Like I wear an Apple Watch, I love my Apple

28
00:01:33,725 --> 00:01:37,685
Speaker 2:  Watch, but we were promised this big revolution in wearable

29
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:40,685
Speaker 2:  technology and I don't think we ever really got it. So we're gonna try to

30
00:01:40,685 --> 00:01:44,085
Speaker 2:  figure out why all that is coming up in just a second. But first I have to

31
00:01:44,085 --> 00:01:47,885
Speaker 2:  go home and make my face and hair look better before I have to do this again.

32
00:01:48,235 --> 00:01:49,805
Speaker 2:  This is the VCH cast. Let's go.

33
00:02:54,075 --> 00:02:54,565
Speaker 5:  Welcome

34
00:02:54,595 --> 00:02:58,405
Speaker 2:  Back. All right, let's talk about how to have good password

35
00:02:58,405 --> 00:03:02,325
Speaker 2:  hygiene on the internet, which is the least interesting

36
00:03:02,325 --> 00:03:06,085
Speaker 2:  thing I could possibly imagine saying to begin this, but

37
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:09,445
Speaker 2:  that's actually part of why I want to talk about this. I feel like I've spent

38
00:03:09,515 --> 00:03:13,245
Speaker 2:  most of my life scolding people to have better passwords and

39
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:16,765
Speaker 2:  use a password manager and get two factor authentication, but not

40
00:03:17,005 --> 00:03:20,685
Speaker 2:  SMS two-factor authentication. And it turns out most people just

41
00:03:20,775 --> 00:03:24,685
Speaker 2:  don't care. And even I still use the same password across way too many

42
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:28,725
Speaker 2:  services. It's a real problem. But there's this one new technology called

43
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:32,605
Speaker 2:  passkeys that in theory might be the solution to all of our problems.

44
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:36,525
Speaker 2:  It's designed to be more secure than passwords and also simpler than passwords

45
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:40,525
Speaker 2:  and basically just better in every imaginable way. And it's growing really

46
00:03:40,525 --> 00:03:44,245
Speaker 2:  fast. Google supports passkey now. So does Amazon, iOS and

47
00:03:44,245 --> 00:03:48,165
Speaker 2:  Android both do. You can passkey log into TikTok and WhatsApp

48
00:03:48,165 --> 00:03:52,005
Speaker 2:  and Uber and PayPal and a whole bunch of other services. This tech is very

49
00:03:52,005 --> 00:03:55,685
Speaker 2:  much catching on in a way. A lot of the supposed

50
00:03:55,805 --> 00:03:59,605
Speaker 2:  replacements to the Password haven't in the past, but I have to confess,

51
00:03:59,845 --> 00:04:03,805
Speaker 2:  I don't really understand pass keys. I mean I understand the theory.

52
00:04:03,915 --> 00:04:07,445
Speaker 2:  They use an encrypted token on your device to authenticate you rather than

53
00:04:07,565 --> 00:04:10,965
Speaker 2:  a Password that you type into a text box. That's about all I understand about

54
00:04:10,965 --> 00:04:14,245
Speaker 2:  it. So I invited onto the show. Somebody Who knows much better.

55
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,885
Speaker 6:  Anna Pobletts head of Password list at one password.

56
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:22,205
Speaker 2:  Anna has been working on Password List Tech for a long time. So I

57
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:25,965
Speaker 2:  asked her to come on the show and explain to me how passkeys work, why

58
00:04:26,205 --> 00:04:29,885
Speaker 2:  everyone is convinced they're The future and most of all how we as normal

59
00:04:29,985 --> 00:04:33,805
Speaker 2:  humans are supposed to use them in our lives. One note

60
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:37,485
Speaker 2:  before we get into it, she talks a bunch about one password specifically,

61
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:40,285
Speaker 2:  which makes sense. I mean that's where she works, but a lot of what she's

62
00:04:40,285 --> 00:04:44,245
Speaker 2:  talking about is true for most password managers and most platforms.

63
00:04:44,245 --> 00:04:47,525
Speaker 2:  That's part of the point of pass keys is that they are the same everywhere.

64
00:04:47,825 --> 00:04:51,765
Speaker 2:  She also makes a point later on in the interview about the upsides of

65
00:04:51,845 --> 00:04:55,525
Speaker 2:  a third party cross platform password manager rather than using the

66
00:04:55,555 --> 00:04:58,685
Speaker 2:  ones built into your device. And I actually think that argument is pretty

67
00:04:58,685 --> 00:05:02,085
Speaker 2:  compelling, but again, there are a lot of good options there and you kind

68
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:05,645
Speaker 2:  of can't go wrong. Anyway, let's get into it. The first thing I asked Anna

69
00:05:05,645 --> 00:05:09,325
Speaker 2:  about is basically why haven't we killed passwords yet?

70
00:05:09,555 --> 00:05:13,085
Speaker 2:  It's been the death of password for forever Pass keys are

71
00:05:13,365 --> 00:05:17,125
Speaker 2:  supposedly the end of passwords, but I've heard that so, so, so many times

72
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:21,005
Speaker 2:  before. So what is it about passwords that means they just won't go

73
00:05:21,005 --> 00:05:21,285
Speaker 2:  away?

74
00:05:21,895 --> 00:05:25,845
Speaker 6:  We've been talking about how passwords are bad for like 20, 25 years, right?

75
00:05:25,915 --> 00:05:26,205
Speaker 6:  Like

76
00:05:26,205 --> 00:05:26,885
Speaker 2:  Since passwords.

77
00:05:27,385 --> 00:05:31,325
Speaker 6:  Yes, exactly. Like over and over again. So why now seems like a very

78
00:05:31,325 --> 00:05:35,085
Speaker 6:  reasonable question and I think the truth is that this is the first

79
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:38,885
Speaker 6:  time where security and user experience aren't

80
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:42,685
Speaker 6:  mutually exclusive If. you think about previous attempts to either

81
00:05:42,685 --> 00:05:46,485
Speaker 6:  like improve the security of passwords or replace passwords, they always

82
00:05:46,485 --> 00:05:49,605
Speaker 6:  come at the expense of user experience. So for example,

83
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:53,605
Speaker 6:  multifactor authentication add security to passwords by you know,

84
00:05:53,675 --> 00:05:57,280
Speaker 6:  requiring A-T-O-T-P code or an email or something like that.

85
00:05:57,465 --> 00:06:01,325
Speaker 6:  But that's an extra thing that a user has to do to log in If. you think about

86
00:06:01,475 --> 00:06:05,165
Speaker 6:  certain types of biometrics like proprietary biometrics, that's some sort

87
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:08,325
Speaker 6:  of hardware that you need to add into the mix. And so there's always this

88
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:11,925
Speaker 6:  extra step or extra thing that a user has to think about.

89
00:06:12,385 --> 00:06:16,005
Speaker 6:  But with pass keys, the idea is that you don't have to compromise on those

90
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:19,605
Speaker 6:  things. You're gonna get better security and you'll also get a really

91
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:21,925
Speaker 6:  smooth frictionless sign in process.

92
00:06:22,705 --> 00:06:26,285
Speaker 2:  So from a pure user experience perspective, I think it's, it's right

93
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:30,565
Speaker 2:  to say people will do the simplest thing, right? And even when we know

94
00:06:30,565 --> 00:06:34,285
Speaker 2:  it's bad, even when it's terrible hygiene that everybody agrees

95
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:38,525
Speaker 2:  is bad, I think most people intellectually know don't use the same

96
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:42,085
Speaker 2:  crappy password for every single thing and yet most people do because it

97
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:44,725
Speaker 2:  is, it is just the easiest thing to do and it's very annoying to remember

98
00:06:44,725 --> 00:06:47,885
Speaker 2:  all of your different passwords in, in a funny way, it seems like the bar

99
00:06:47,885 --> 00:06:51,685
Speaker 2:  is both very low in that you have to replace people's crummy

100
00:06:51,965 --> 00:06:55,405
Speaker 2:  passwords with something more secure but also very high because actually

101
00:06:55,765 --> 00:06:59,485
Speaker 2:  remembering one password that is just 1, 2, 3, 4 and then typing that in

102
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,005
Speaker 2:  everywhere is actually a pretty good user experience.

103
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:06,125
Speaker 6:  Certainly a good user experience. Yes. But the bar is so low on

104
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,325
Speaker 6:  the security side it

105
00:07:07,325 --> 00:07:08,845
Speaker 2:  Leads to bad things I suppose. Yeah,

106
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:12,725
Speaker 6:  Exactly. So when I think about like all the things that are wrong with

107
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:16,525
Speaker 6:  passwords, for me it really comes down to the fact that passwords

108
00:07:16,945 --> 00:07:20,845
Speaker 6:  put all of the burden on a user to be secure, right? It's on you

109
00:07:20,905 --> 00:07:24,765
Speaker 6:  as a person to think up good passwords, remember them not use

110
00:07:24,765 --> 00:07:28,405
Speaker 6:  the same one everywhere, not fall for a phishing attack, all of these things.

111
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:32,725
Speaker 6:  But with Passkeys the goal is we can actually remove the human

112
00:07:32,735 --> 00:07:36,685
Speaker 6:  error completely from logging into apps. And so if we give

113
00:07:36,685 --> 00:07:39,925
Speaker 6:  you something that's easy and frictionless and the security is actually built

114
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:43,765
Speaker 6:  into the technology, then there's nothing for you to do wrong, right? Like

115
00:07:43,945 --> 00:07:47,925
Speaker 6:  it just works. So in the case at Passkeys, when you're logging in, all it

116
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:51,525
Speaker 6:  does, it looks and feels to you like you're just unlocking your device.

117
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:55,525
Speaker 6:  Usually something like Face Id touch, ID windows, hello. And

118
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:59,165
Speaker 6:  so it looks and feels like something that is familiar to you, something you

119
00:07:59,165 --> 00:08:02,445
Speaker 6:  know how to do and there's nothing, there's no thought you have to put into

120
00:08:02,445 --> 00:08:06,405
Speaker 6:  it of did I pick my most secure passkey, right? It's

121
00:08:06,405 --> 00:08:08,165
Speaker 6:  just kind of all happening behind the scenes.

122
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:12,245
Speaker 2:  That's really smart because I think so much of this stuff, and we talk about

123
00:08:12,245 --> 00:08:16,205
Speaker 2:  this with sort of security and privacy in all forms on the internet, it

124
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:20,045
Speaker 2:  all ends in scolding, right? You kinda have to make people feel bad and

125
00:08:20,095 --> 00:08:23,445
Speaker 2:  scare them in certain ways in order to just like beat them into having good

126
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:26,885
Speaker 2:  behavior. And what it actually is is If, you give people a better product

127
00:08:26,995 --> 00:08:30,405
Speaker 2:  that is also safer, they'll do it and If you make them feel bad, they still

128
00:08:30,405 --> 00:08:33,765
Speaker 2:  won't change their ways and I think what this whole industry seems to be

129
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:36,365
Speaker 2:  coming around to in a cool way is like what if we just built better products

130
00:08:36,555 --> 00:08:38,445
Speaker 2:  percent? And I think that's very exciting.

131
00:08:38,755 --> 00:08:42,245
Speaker 6:  Yeah, totally. Like it's not that people don't wanna be secure,

132
00:08:42,845 --> 00:08:45,725
Speaker 6:  I think that's not where this is coming from. That's not why passwords have

133
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:49,005
Speaker 6:  stayed around. It's sort of just like an inertia, like it is what people

134
00:08:49,005 --> 00:08:52,885
Speaker 6:  know how to do and it's there and there's never really been an

135
00:08:52,885 --> 00:08:56,805
Speaker 6:  option that feels a lot better. Like I used to do security consulting

136
00:08:56,825 --> 00:09:00,645
Speaker 6:  for a number of years and we would work with these companies and they, we'd

137
00:09:00,645 --> 00:09:04,005
Speaker 6:  tell them like, hey you have a weak password policy or you need to add two

138
00:09:04,005 --> 00:09:07,325
Speaker 6:  factor, all these like controls around your account security and

139
00:09:07,335 --> 00:09:11,205
Speaker 6:  especially for consumer facing applications, they'd be like, I mean I could

140
00:09:11,305 --> 00:09:14,365
Speaker 6:  but that's gonna hurt my user conversions. People aren't gonna sign up for

141
00:09:14,365 --> 00:09:17,725
Speaker 6:  my application. And so that trade off was never worth it to them, right?

142
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:21,285
Speaker 6:  But with Passkey you can actually, like we can say this is actually gonna

143
00:09:21,285 --> 00:09:24,885
Speaker 6:  help your conversions. Users will sign up faster for your application and

144
00:09:24,885 --> 00:09:28,525
Speaker 6:  so all of a sudden there's also a business reason to use Passkey, not just

145
00:09:28,605 --> 00:09:30,285
Speaker 6:  a security reason. Yeah.

146
00:09:30,285 --> 00:09:34,245
Speaker 2:  Where did Passkey come from? I feel like in the time I've been covering

147
00:09:34,245 --> 00:09:36,845
Speaker 2:  the space, there was a minute where it was like everybody's gonna have a

148
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:40,805
Speaker 2:  Yuba key and that's the solution. And then we got into two factor

149
00:09:40,905 --> 00:09:44,445
Speaker 2:  in all of its many different forms and I think we, we went from bad two factor

150
00:09:44,445 --> 00:09:47,845
Speaker 2:  over SMS to like pretty good two factor inside of apps like one Password

151
00:09:47,865 --> 00:09:51,165
Speaker 2:  and Auie and some of the other stuff around. And Passkey kind of

152
00:09:51,655 --> 00:09:54,685
Speaker 2:  crept up on me a little bit over the last couple of years, but my sense is

153
00:09:54,685 --> 00:09:58,205
Speaker 2:  they've been around longer than most people realize as kind of a

154
00:09:58,205 --> 00:10:00,405
Speaker 2:  possibility and an idea like where did this come from?

155
00:10:00,635 --> 00:10:04,485
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so there's a technology that kind of underlies passkeys called

156
00:10:04,585 --> 00:10:08,165
Speaker 6:  Web that's been around for probably about 10 years I think.

157
00:10:08,745 --> 00:10:12,645
Speaker 6:  And there's a group called the Fido Alliance that's like an industry organization.

158
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:16,885
Speaker 6:  A lot of big companies are a part of it and they're all focused on, you know,

159
00:10:17,085 --> 00:10:20,645
Speaker 6:  bringing Passwordless authentication to the world. And so this protocol was

160
00:10:20,805 --> 00:10:24,605
Speaker 6:  invented, it's the same thing that UB keys use that's used to provide

161
00:10:24,605 --> 00:10:27,765
Speaker 6:  this sort of public key cryptography based

162
00:10:27,805 --> 00:10:31,685
Speaker 6:  authentication. Okay? So it's been around for a really long time, but you

163
00:10:31,685 --> 00:10:35,205
Speaker 6:  usually had to have some sort of hardware key, like a Yui key and so

164
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:39,285
Speaker 6:  you, it might work really well in a workforce or a corporate environment

165
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:42,565
Speaker 6:  but could be really challenging for the everyday people who don't just have

166
00:10:42,565 --> 00:10:43,605
Speaker 6:  a yui key, right? I

167
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:47,485
Speaker 2:  Got a Yui key, I set up everything on my Yui key and then I realized the

168
00:10:47,485 --> 00:10:51,325
Speaker 2:  place I leave my keys is several rooms away from where I sit, right?

169
00:10:51,325 --> 00:10:52,285
Speaker 6:  It's not near your computer.

170
00:10:52,605 --> 00:10:55,365
Speaker 2:  Like my keys are upstairs right now with my Yuba key on them and there is

171
00:10:55,365 --> 00:10:56,845
Speaker 2:  no chance I'm gonna use it exactly

172
00:10:56,845 --> 00:11:00,725
Speaker 6:  Like the fact that you even have one is really rare. And so a

173
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:04,525
Speaker 6:  couple years ago there's this big announcement from the major platform saying

174
00:11:04,895 --> 00:11:08,485
Speaker 6:  we're now supporting what we're calling passkey, which is essentially web

175
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:12,245
Speaker 6:  ath credentials that can be synced between your platform account.

176
00:11:12,585 --> 00:11:16,565
Speaker 6:  So now instead of being tied to hardware, those passkey are stored in

177
00:11:16,565 --> 00:11:20,485
Speaker 6:  your iCloud account or your Google or your Microsoft account and more

178
00:11:20,685 --> 00:11:24,165
Speaker 6:  recently maybe your one password account, which will obviously get into at

179
00:11:24,165 --> 00:11:27,965
Speaker 6:  some point. But the idea is that now these credentials are a little bit more

180
00:11:27,965 --> 00:11:31,685
Speaker 6:  accessible, you don't need special hardware, they'll sync between your

181
00:11:31,685 --> 00:11:34,765
Speaker 6:  different devices a little bit better to make it a little bit easier for

182
00:11:34,765 --> 00:11:38,725
Speaker 6:  you to access them. And that's been like the big push that you're

183
00:11:38,725 --> 00:11:39,885
Speaker 6:  hearing about in the last couple years.

184
00:11:40,705 --> 00:11:44,525
Speaker 2:  Got it. Okay. And was there a technical development that made that

185
00:11:45,165 --> 00:11:49,005
Speaker 2:  possible? Like what happened between a decade ago and maybe two

186
00:11:49,005 --> 00:11:51,925
Speaker 2:  years ago when this really started to become a thing that kind of tipped

187
00:11:51,925 --> 00:11:54,605
Speaker 2:  it into this is a thing thing we can do in a real mainstream way now?

188
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:58,605
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it was really this syncing concept and so Apple, Google,

189
00:11:59,005 --> 00:12:02,725
Speaker 6:  Microsoft saying like, yes, instead of storing these credentials

190
00:12:03,545 --> 00:12:07,525
Speaker 6:  in like a secure enclave on a device, we can store them securely in your

191
00:12:07,615 --> 00:12:10,645
Speaker 6:  cloud account. I see. And we can sync them between these different devices.

192
00:12:10,825 --> 00:12:14,605
Speaker 6:  So you know, in some really, really high assurance environments that

193
00:12:14,605 --> 00:12:17,485
Speaker 6:  might be a little bit of a security trade off, right? Because you don't have

194
00:12:17,485 --> 00:12:21,325
Speaker 6:  as much hardware security there. But for most consumer use cases,

195
00:12:21,385 --> 00:12:25,125
Speaker 6:  if you're logging into Home Depot or Netflix or things like that, that's

196
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,285
Speaker 6:  actually still a really good security story and it's way, way better than

197
00:12:28,605 --> 00:12:32,045
Speaker 6:  passwords. So you're still getting all of those sort of unfishable

198
00:12:32,445 --> 00:12:36,125
Speaker 6:  security benefits of pass keys but with a little bit more user

199
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:36,885
Speaker 6:  friendliness.

200
00:12:37,265 --> 00:12:40,285
Speaker 2:  Got it. Okay. Yeah, so talk to me about the unfishable part of this because

201
00:12:40,365 --> 00:12:43,365
Speaker 2:  I think I was reading through in preparing for this a bunch of the

202
00:12:43,775 --> 00:12:47,165
Speaker 2:  criticisms people have of kind of all of the password replacing technology.

203
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:51,405
Speaker 2:  And there are two I wanna talk about. One is now everything

204
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:54,005
Speaker 2:  is on my one device. What happens if I lose my device? We'll get to that

205
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:56,445
Speaker 2:  in a second because I think that's very interesting and also just happened

206
00:12:56,445 --> 00:12:59,765
Speaker 2:  to me recently. So we'll talk about that. But the other one is people saying

207
00:12:59,835 --> 00:13:03,525
Speaker 2:  well actually secure passwords are part of the problem, but the

208
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:07,205
Speaker 2:  bigger problem is phishing and it's people social

209
00:13:07,645 --> 00:13:10,285
Speaker 2:  engineering their way into my accounts and actually what we have to solve

210
00:13:10,305 --> 00:13:14,245
Speaker 2:  is that problem and not people having bad passwords because if somebody

211
00:13:14,245 --> 00:13:17,845
Speaker 2:  can convince me to type in my password on a fake webpage, we've solved nothing.

212
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:21,885
Speaker 2:  But the belief with Passkeys is that they actually solve most if not all

213
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,365
Speaker 2:  of that problem too, right? How does that work?

214
00:13:24,755 --> 00:13:28,445
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so there's a few really big security benefits with Passkey.

215
00:13:28,665 --> 00:13:32,325
Speaker 6:  So there's kind of the obvious of like, you know, there is no user

216
00:13:32,475 --> 00:13:36,245
Speaker 6:  generated secret type of thing that someone could guess that they could

217
00:13:36,245 --> 00:13:38,965
Speaker 6:  just, you know, reuse across a bunch of websites and guess

218
00:13:39,165 --> 00:13:41,685
Speaker 2:  I can't leak you a password if I don't have a Password, I guess is something

219
00:13:41,715 --> 00:13:42,205
Speaker 2:  exactly.

220
00:13:42,305 --> 00:13:46,245
Speaker 6:  If I don't know what it is, you can't guess it. So that's really big,

221
00:13:46,245 --> 00:13:49,885
Speaker 6:  right? There's a lot of attacks that can happen remotely and at scale

222
00:13:50,115 --> 00:13:53,725
Speaker 6:  that things like credential stuffing are really common against websites.

223
00:13:53,725 --> 00:13:57,605
Speaker 6:  So those things kinda all go away because there just really isn't a credential

224
00:13:57,665 --> 00:14:01,325
Speaker 6:  in the traditional sense. Now the other big thing is of course

225
00:14:01,845 --> 00:14:05,725
Speaker 6:  resistance to phishing attacks. So passkey are tied

226
00:14:05,785 --> 00:14:09,485
Speaker 6:  to a specific website or domain and so if a, an

227
00:14:09,485 --> 00:14:13,125
Speaker 6:  attacker were to make a lookalike site, you know, facebook.com with

228
00:14:13,295 --> 00:14:17,205
Speaker 6:  zeros instead of os your passkey for facebook.com like will

229
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:20,885
Speaker 6:  not be used on Facebook the lookalike site, right? Like

230
00:14:20,895 --> 00:14:24,245
Speaker 6:  those keys simply aren't transferable, they're not the same thing because

231
00:14:24,245 --> 00:14:28,005
Speaker 2:  The key on your phone and the key on fake Facebook just will literally

232
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:29,325
Speaker 2:  will not understand each other

233
00:14:29,475 --> 00:14:33,445
Speaker 6:  Exactly like that key won't be used on that site sort of at the

234
00:14:33,445 --> 00:14:36,605
Speaker 6:  device level, at the browser level. Like all, there's a lot of protections

235
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:40,245
Speaker 6:  in place to sort of tie these pass keys to a specific domain.

236
00:14:40,665 --> 00:14:44,525
Speaker 6:  And so at least for that specific type of phishing attack where, which is

237
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:47,005
Speaker 6:  really common, you know you have a lookalike site, they ask you for your

238
00:14:47,205 --> 00:14:50,645
Speaker 6:  password and then they reuse it on the real site, that just kind of totally

239
00:14:50,675 --> 00:14:54,365
Speaker 6:  goes away. And I think that's really big, especially right now there's

240
00:14:54,505 --> 00:14:58,405
Speaker 6:  so many news articles around like AI and how AI is

241
00:14:58,405 --> 00:15:01,805
Speaker 6:  making it even easier to make really realistic phishing attacks.

242
00:15:02,275 --> 00:15:06,085
Speaker 6:  This type of prevention of that whole swath of attacks is really,

243
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:09,925
Speaker 6:  really big and just gives people a little bit more confidence I think

244
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:13,765
Speaker 6:  when using the internet that you don't have to constantly wonder is this

245
00:15:13,765 --> 00:15:17,205
Speaker 6:  the real site? Is this a real email? Like do I need to double check? Like

246
00:15:17,485 --> 00:15:19,965
Speaker 6:  I think just giving people a little more confidence in that way is helpful.

247
00:15:20,435 --> 00:15:24,365
Speaker 2:  Well and there's a weird tension in that even that it feels too easy

248
00:15:25,005 --> 00:15:28,845
Speaker 2:  honestly using past keys sometimes where it's like this can't actually be

249
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:32,765
Speaker 2:  solving my problem. All I did was tap the thing, the popup on

250
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,845
Speaker 2:  my phone that said we cool and I said, yeah, we cool. And then I, and now

251
00:15:35,845 --> 00:15:39,805
Speaker 2:  I'm logged in like at least with a password you kind of understand I am

252
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:43,645
Speaker 2:  delivering something that is a secret in order to allow me in.

253
00:15:43,905 --> 00:15:47,005
Speaker 2:  And there is something to the fact that this is so simple that it almost

254
00:15:47,015 --> 00:15:50,965
Speaker 2:  feels less secure even that it's not, I don't know, part of me wants

255
00:15:50,965 --> 00:15:54,485
Speaker 2:  you to like make it seem scarier every time I do it because it'll make it

256
00:15:54,485 --> 00:15:55,085
Speaker 2:  feel more secure.

257
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:59,325
Speaker 6:  This is actually a very real thing that I think I've

258
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:02,685
Speaker 6:  seen that people in the Phyto Alliance have seen when you do research with

259
00:16:02,745 --> 00:16:06,685
Speaker 6:  end users that they're kind of like, oh okay, I guess I

260
00:16:06,685 --> 00:16:10,445
Speaker 6:  logged in. Like they maybe don't even recognize that they actually like registered

261
00:16:10,545 --> 00:16:13,405
Speaker 6:  for or logged into an application and they're like, okay, I guess that was

262
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,485
Speaker 6:  okay, how am I gonna do that next time? Or they don't totally

263
00:16:16,815 --> 00:16:20,245
Speaker 6:  understand. And so there's been a ton of research done on the best ways to

264
00:16:20,565 --> 00:16:24,485
Speaker 6:  communicate to users what's going on, which I think is so important as websites

265
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:28,085
Speaker 6:  start to roll out pass keys that the user experience there is just so important

266
00:16:28,145 --> 00:16:32,005
Speaker 6:  to make sure users are like, oh, okay, like this looks and feels

267
00:16:32,005 --> 00:16:35,445
Speaker 6:  like my touch, ID like I understand what I'm doing here and kind of giving

268
00:16:35,445 --> 00:16:39,045
Speaker 6:  them that experience. but it's really hard, which is, it's silly, kind of

269
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:42,965
Speaker 6:  silly that you know, security has to look hard. Like people are used to

270
00:16:43,245 --> 00:16:46,405
Speaker 6:  security being hard, right? For it to work. And so it's kind of breaking

271
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,285
Speaker 6:  that stereotype

272
00:16:47,585 --> 00:16:50,405
Speaker 2:  And that kind of goes to the other piece of feedback I've seen a bunch about

273
00:16:50,405 --> 00:16:53,765
Speaker 2:  Passkeys, which is that we've all been trained now that you have to have

274
00:16:53,765 --> 00:16:56,125
Speaker 2:  two factors, right? There's, there's the thing, you know, and the thing you

275
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:59,765
Speaker 2:  have and the thing I know is my password and the thing I have is my phone.

276
00:16:59,975 --> 00:17:03,725
Speaker 2:  Great. That is better than just a password and there's something to

277
00:17:04,115 --> 00:17:08,005
Speaker 2:  kind of compressing all of that back down into a passkey that

278
00:17:08,155 --> 00:17:11,485
Speaker 2:  like I just, I, I don't even remember I like tweeted or something about

279
00:17:11,835 --> 00:17:15,165
Speaker 2:  passkey in one password being like, this is cool, it's, I can now have all

280
00:17:15,165 --> 00:17:17,445
Speaker 2:  of my stuff in both apps and I got a bunch of responses from people being

281
00:17:17,445 --> 00:17:20,725
Speaker 2:  like that's not two factor security, that's one factor security because it

282
00:17:20,725 --> 00:17:24,285
Speaker 2:  all just lives inside of one password. And I was like, I don't think that's

283
00:17:24,285 --> 00:17:24,445
Speaker 2:  true

284
00:17:24,945 --> 00:17:25,365
Speaker 6:  But I'm

285
00:17:25,365 --> 00:17:28,525
Speaker 2:  Not. But I sort of see the point right where it's now as long as I'm holding

286
00:17:28,585 --> 00:17:32,565
Speaker 2:  my phone there's no other jobs to do and I, I wonder

287
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:36,365
Speaker 2:  if part of that is again you're sort of obfuscating the steps in the name

288
00:17:36,365 --> 00:17:40,325
Speaker 2:  of simplicity that actually makes it feel like I'm not doing the hard work

289
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,485
Speaker 2:  of being secure anymore.

290
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:45,125
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I think that's really fair. And I think, you know, we've talked about

291
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,925
Speaker 6:  these traditional authentication factors, something you know, something you

292
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:51,205
Speaker 6:  have something you are or whatever and talking about pesky in that sense

293
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:54,565
Speaker 6:  is like a little bit confusing but I think we, I kind of do it anyway to

294
00:17:54,565 --> 00:17:57,725
Speaker 6:  help explain to people. I think the easiest way to think about it is it's

295
00:17:57,725 --> 00:18:01,485
Speaker 6:  something that you have, it's whatever device you're currently logged onto,

296
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:05,845
Speaker 6:  say your Google device or your one password ever, your one password, your

297
00:18:05,845 --> 00:18:09,685
Speaker 6:  browser extension or your desktop app and then it's also something you either

298
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:13,885
Speaker 6:  have or are or know or something like that depending on, you know,

299
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:17,405
Speaker 6:  it's either your touch id face id your pin, your one Password

300
00:18:17,685 --> 00:18:21,245
Speaker 6:  password and secret key. It can be like whatever that other factor is that

301
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:24,285
Speaker 6:  you're actually using to log into the account where your passkey is stored.

302
00:18:24,545 --> 00:18:28,085
Speaker 6:  But there's always a little bit of a like device ownership

303
00:18:28,185 --> 00:18:31,925
Speaker 6:  aspect to that which kind of gives you that second factor. And so it's a

304
00:18:31,925 --> 00:18:34,445
Speaker 6:  little bit like square peg, round hole, but I think you can kind of roughly

305
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:38,485
Speaker 6:  put passkey into that bucket to help people feel a little bit better about

306
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:38,605
Speaker 6:  that.

307
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,765
Speaker 2:  Okay. Yeah so the the two factors then If, you were to sort of boil that

308
00:18:41,765 --> 00:18:45,525
Speaker 2:  all the way down would basically be my phone and the information

309
00:18:45,845 --> 00:18:47,005
Speaker 2:  required to log into my phone.

310
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:47,725
Speaker 6:  Exactly. Yep.

311
00:18:47,725 --> 00:18:51,645
Speaker 2:  Which is two things and I think I ironically back to the like this

312
00:18:51,645 --> 00:18:54,685
Speaker 2:  is almost too easy thing. I think If you were forced to type in your passcode

313
00:18:54,685 --> 00:18:58,285
Speaker 2:  every time it would make more sense. Whereas with the face ID or the windows,

314
00:18:58,295 --> 00:19:01,965
Speaker 2:  hello, it kind of, it almost happens so fast that you lose track of it and

315
00:19:01,965 --> 00:19:04,685
Speaker 2:  it's like well I didn't have to authenticate anything and I was like, no

316
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,325
Speaker 2:  you did, it just happened really quickly and automatically, which is a great

317
00:19:07,325 --> 00:19:10,405
Speaker 2:  thing but kind of an alarming one to get used to at first. Yeah, like I I,

318
00:19:10,545 --> 00:19:13,645
Speaker 2:  it certainly took me a few tries to realize oh it's doing face ID every single

319
00:19:13,645 --> 00:19:17,405
Speaker 2:  time my pass key comes up because that's part of the authentication process.

320
00:19:17,635 --> 00:19:21,005
Speaker 6:  Exactly and I don't think people think about that when they're just unlocking

321
00:19:21,005 --> 00:19:24,485
Speaker 6:  their phone to use it. Like they don't necessarily think too hard about it,

322
00:19:24,485 --> 00:19:27,685
Speaker 6:  it's just become sort of second nature. But maybe it was like that at the

323
00:19:27,685 --> 00:19:30,285
Speaker 6:  beginning and it was like, oh my gosh, my password, my phone's not locked.

324
00:19:30,425 --> 00:19:33,245
Speaker 6:  But yeah, I think it's like you almost don't notice because you're so used

325
00:19:33,245 --> 00:19:36,805
Speaker 6:  to using your face ID or your touch ID for all sorts of things, right? Like

326
00:19:36,845 --> 00:19:40,645
Speaker 6:  a lot of apps use that technology just to unlock an app and so the

327
00:19:40,645 --> 00:19:44,045
Speaker 6:  idea is we are using the thing that's familiar to people, it's just you know,

328
00:19:44,045 --> 00:19:47,805
Speaker 6:  getting people comfortable with that technology in a new context like a

329
00:19:47,805 --> 00:19:48,725
Speaker 6:  website or an app.

330
00:19:49,075 --> 00:19:52,765
Speaker 2:  What do you make of the idea of tying a lot of this stuff to a

331
00:19:52,765 --> 00:19:56,485
Speaker 2:  device? I think on the one hand phones are sort of inextricable parts of

332
00:19:56,825 --> 00:20:00,525
Speaker 2:  us at this point. Like my phone's right here or my UBI key is upstairs. Like

333
00:20:00,525 --> 00:20:03,765
Speaker 2:  that is a telling fact, right? But at the same time, I had this moment the

334
00:20:03,765 --> 00:20:06,405
Speaker 2:  other week where I woke up one morning and my phone had updated overnight

335
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:09,365
Speaker 2:  and was bricked the touch screen didn't work, I couldn't do anything and

336
00:20:09,365 --> 00:20:12,405
Speaker 2:  I had this moment of realizing like, oh I can't do two factors because I

337
00:20:12,405 --> 00:20:16,005
Speaker 2:  can't get SMSs, I can't see them anymore, I can't get into my one

338
00:20:16,245 --> 00:20:19,685
Speaker 2:  Password account because it's, it's just sitting here on my phone. I can't

339
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:23,125
Speaker 2:  text my wife. And like I had this crazy moment of being like, oh I am way

340
00:20:23,185 --> 00:20:26,965
Speaker 2:  too reliant on my phone to work and have a charge and be sitting here nearby

341
00:20:26,965 --> 00:20:30,685
Speaker 2:  me all the time and otherwise my life kind of falls apart. And

342
00:20:31,045 --> 00:20:34,445
Speaker 2:  I think there is a reflexive worry that people have about that. That it's

343
00:20:34,445 --> 00:20:38,405
Speaker 2:  like the nice thing about having a bunch of insecure passwords stored

344
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,645
Speaker 2:  in my head is the battery doesn't die.

345
00:20:40,925 --> 00:20:42,605
Speaker 6:  Yeah. They're always there. Right?

346
00:20:42,605 --> 00:20:46,485
Speaker 2:  And so like is it the right path to go down you think to tie it to

347
00:20:46,485 --> 00:20:48,005
Speaker 2:  these devices in that way?

348
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:52,485
Speaker 6:  I think it's better to think about it less is tying it to a device

349
00:20:52,825 --> 00:20:56,565
Speaker 6:  and more of tying it to your like platform

350
00:20:56,565 --> 00:21:00,285
Speaker 6:  account. So if you're an Apple user primarily, you know you have an

351
00:21:00,285 --> 00:21:04,085
Speaker 6:  iPhone and a MacBook and all that, you probably use your iCloud account to

352
00:21:04,085 --> 00:21:07,925
Speaker 6:  store your contacts and to store a lot of stuff. And so when you

353
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:12,045
Speaker 6:  get a new phone for example, you log into iCloud and like you recover all

354
00:21:12,045 --> 00:21:15,725
Speaker 6:  of your data in that way, right? Right. And So I think thinking about it

355
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:19,525
Speaker 6:  that way is a little bit more realistic to be honest of sort of the

356
00:21:19,525 --> 00:21:23,405
Speaker 6:  current state of past keys where it's challenging. It's the same way

357
00:21:23,405 --> 00:21:26,165
Speaker 6:  like you lose your phone, it's really annoying to recover all of that data

358
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:30,245
Speaker 6:  but Passkeys will get recovered. If you think back to like the old

359
00:21:30,265 --> 00:21:34,165
Speaker 6:  web auth end days, your Passkeys were like impossible to recover in

360
00:21:34,165 --> 00:21:37,405
Speaker 6:  that situation. And so that's one of the big problems we were trying to solve

361
00:21:37,465 --> 00:21:41,045
Speaker 6:  is to make account recovery a little bit more possible. I think that's also

362
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:44,965
Speaker 6:  a really big benefit to using something like one Password So I

363
00:21:45,105 --> 00:21:49,045
Speaker 6:  use a MacBook laptop but I have an Android phone and So I have this

364
00:21:49,045 --> 00:21:52,805
Speaker 6:  like cross platform situation in my life that isn't really

365
00:21:52,815 --> 00:21:56,605
Speaker 6:  ideal for Passkeys to be honest because a Passkeys on my Android

366
00:21:56,605 --> 00:21:59,965
Speaker 6:  phone doesn't really naturally translate to my MacBook. It's this really

367
00:21:59,965 --> 00:22:03,605
Speaker 6:  kind of weird QR code experience. But instead I use one

368
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:04,685
Speaker 6:  password for everything.

369
00:22:05,435 --> 00:22:09,085
Speaker 2:  Okay. And then be the idea is that then because one password works

370
00:22:09,085 --> 00:22:12,925
Speaker 2:  across platforms, my pass keys live in my one password

371
00:22:12,925 --> 00:22:15,325
Speaker 2:  account, they don't live on my phone, they don't live on my laptop, they

372
00:22:15,325 --> 00:22:17,845
Speaker 2:  live in my one password account. And as long as I can get into my one Password

373
00:22:17,845 --> 00:22:21,565
Speaker 2:  account, which ironically soon you might do through a pass key which we should

374
00:22:21,565 --> 00:22:24,125
Speaker 2:  talk about, then I kind of have it wherever I am.

375
00:22:24,195 --> 00:22:24,685
Speaker 6:  Exactly.

376
00:22:25,075 --> 00:22:28,045
Speaker 2:  That structure makes sense to me because then you're on, as long as you can

377
00:22:28,045 --> 00:22:31,765
Speaker 2:  log into something, which I think in the year 2024 is a pretty

378
00:22:31,765 --> 00:22:35,485
Speaker 2:  reasonable assumption to make. But that brings me to the question of

379
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:38,925
Speaker 2:  logging into all of my pass keys with a pass key

380
00:22:39,545 --> 00:22:41,765
Speaker 2:  and and I just think part of what's really interesting about that is like

381
00:22:42,065 --> 00:22:46,005
Speaker 2:  one password is very much starting to try to own like the whole security

382
00:22:46,135 --> 00:22:50,045
Speaker 2:  stack, right? Like I now have two factor codes in my one Password I

383
00:22:50,045 --> 00:22:53,405
Speaker 2:  have, I have my passkey in my one password and I would think that

384
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:57,245
Speaker 2:  raises the stakes pretty dramatically for one password

385
00:22:57,355 --> 00:23:01,165
Speaker 2:  that now if something bad happens to my one password stuff, not only

386
00:23:01,225 --> 00:23:04,405
Speaker 2:  are is someone gonna get a control of my passwords, they're gonna get control

387
00:23:04,405 --> 00:23:08,285
Speaker 2:  of everything. And like one piece of security advice that I've heard

388
00:23:08,285 --> 00:23:11,125
Speaker 2:  from people over and over and over is don't store everything in one place

389
00:23:11,275 --> 00:23:14,925
Speaker 2:  because you should assume everything is insecure and essentially like don't

390
00:23:14,925 --> 00:23:18,405
Speaker 2:  let the two sides of the coin talk to each other. And you're kind of saying

391
00:23:18,405 --> 00:23:21,725
Speaker 2:  the opposite, which is like put everything in this one place because it's

392
00:23:21,795 --> 00:23:25,605
Speaker 2:  simpler and better And I certainly agree that it's simpler but like does

393
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:29,085
Speaker 2:  it change the way you have to think about even the security of one password

394
00:23:29,085 --> 00:23:30,085
Speaker 2:  itself? That's

395
00:23:30,085 --> 00:23:34,045
Speaker 6:  A really interesting question. I actually don't think it does because our

396
00:23:34,215 --> 00:23:38,205
Speaker 6:  whole thing from the beginning has been that we take

397
00:23:38,205 --> 00:23:41,525
Speaker 6:  your security and privacy really seriously. Everything is end to

398
00:23:41,525 --> 00:23:45,005
Speaker 6:  unencrypted. Like one password has no access to anyone's

399
00:23:45,105 --> 00:23:49,045
Speaker 6:  actual credentials and I don't necessarily see a Password

400
00:23:49,105 --> 00:23:52,805
Speaker 6:  as being any different from a passkey from like the one Password

401
00:23:52,805 --> 00:23:56,765
Speaker 6:  perspective. It's ultimately just a credential material of some sort

402
00:23:56,765 --> 00:24:00,285
Speaker 6:  that we're storing and we're gonna protect the same way that we would credit

403
00:24:00,285 --> 00:24:04,205
Speaker 6:  card data or social security numbers or like whatever data

404
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:08,085
Speaker 6:  you wanna store with us, right? I I try my best instead of saying password

405
00:24:08,085 --> 00:24:11,485
Speaker 6:  manager to say credential manager or something along those lines because

406
00:24:11,485 --> 00:24:15,165
Speaker 6:  it is so much more than passwords and has been for a really long time and

407
00:24:15,165 --> 00:24:18,805
Speaker 6:  So I actually don't think it changes our security model that much. We're

408
00:24:18,805 --> 00:24:22,765
Speaker 6:  always looking to like upgrade that and like what can we do to improve?

409
00:24:22,765 --> 00:24:26,285
Speaker 6:  Which is where you know obviously using a pass key to sign into one password

410
00:24:26,285 --> 00:24:29,765
Speaker 6:  comes in. Right now we have that Password and secret key

411
00:24:29,995 --> 00:24:33,605
Speaker 6:  sort of model. We have like SSO support if you're a business customer. But

412
00:24:33,945 --> 00:24:37,045
Speaker 6:  for the most part it's kind of that two factor The, the secret key is sort

413
00:24:37,045 --> 00:24:40,165
Speaker 6:  of a device key and so we're always looking for ways to upgrade that, which

414
00:24:40,165 --> 00:24:43,765
Speaker 6:  is why we've been exploring passkey login which would be really incredible

415
00:24:43,825 --> 00:24:45,285
Speaker 6:  to add to to one password.

416
00:24:45,555 --> 00:24:49,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Why does that feel like the right way to do the

417
00:24:49,285 --> 00:24:52,365
Speaker 2:  sort of master login? I think part of what I'm getting at here is I think

418
00:24:52,595 --> 00:24:56,485
Speaker 2:  what we're boiling down to is there being one sort of

419
00:24:56,485 --> 00:25:00,165
Speaker 2:  crucial login, right? Whether it's the passcode on my phone or

420
00:25:00,505 --> 00:25:03,645
Speaker 2:  my master password for one password, like there is going to be

421
00:25:04,385 --> 00:25:08,045
Speaker 2:  one thing I have to know and that is the thing that opens up everything else.

422
00:25:08,105 --> 00:25:11,805
Speaker 2:  And I think with phones, one reason people are nervous is like the Wall Street

423
00:25:11,805 --> 00:25:14,285
Speaker 2:  Journal did a bunch of really good reporting about people having their phones

424
00:25:14,285 --> 00:25:18,165
Speaker 2:  stolen and their passcodes read. And that becomes even scarier

425
00:25:18,165 --> 00:25:21,125
Speaker 2:  in this world where my pass keys also live on my phone because now all you

426
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:24,565
Speaker 2:  need to know is the four digits I use to log into my phone and you can have

427
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:28,445
Speaker 2:  everything. And with something like one Password now it's like I don't, I

428
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:31,805
Speaker 2:  literally don't know any of my passwords except my one Password Password

429
00:25:31,805 --> 00:25:34,605
Speaker 2:  anymore. Which I think in a lot of ways is the intended behavior and that

430
00:25:34,605 --> 00:25:37,525
Speaker 2:  makes sense to me. I don't reuse that Password anywhere. I don't even have

431
00:25:37,525 --> 00:25:40,765
Speaker 2:  that password written down anywhere. It's just, it's the one Password I have

432
00:25:40,765 --> 00:25:44,165
Speaker 2:  memorized but now you're trying to even replace that Why?

433
00:25:44,675 --> 00:25:48,405
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so the good news is like in one password's case in

434
00:25:48,405 --> 00:25:51,325
Speaker 6:  particular, so I'll speak really just about that, but you have this password

435
00:25:51,325 --> 00:25:55,165
Speaker 6:  and you have this secret key and so even in just the, the

436
00:25:55,165 --> 00:25:58,205
Speaker 6:  state of the world right now with one Password, if someone were to get your

437
00:25:58,205 --> 00:26:01,445
Speaker 6:  master password that really long one, the one that you have to remember,

438
00:26:01,715 --> 00:26:04,845
Speaker 6:  they actually still can't get into your one password account unless they

439
00:26:04,915 --> 00:26:08,605
Speaker 6:  also steal a device that you have one Password on already, which is really

440
00:26:08,605 --> 00:26:11,885
Speaker 6:  great, right? That's a good starting point. But now what if we also make

441
00:26:11,885 --> 00:26:15,445
Speaker 6:  it even harder for someone to steal that Password because

442
00:26:15,715 --> 00:26:19,525
Speaker 6:  it's not a password, right? It's not even something you know now Yes that

443
00:26:19,525 --> 00:26:23,445
Speaker 6:  Passkeys does have to then live somewhere, right? So it has to live in your

444
00:26:23,685 --> 00:26:27,245
Speaker 6:  platform account or in a UB key or something along those lines. So there

445
00:26:27,245 --> 00:26:31,205
Speaker 6:  is kind of this like vicious cycle of where does the final

446
00:26:31,395 --> 00:26:35,085
Speaker 6:  pass passkey live And I don't know that that's like a perfectly solved

447
00:26:35,085 --> 00:26:38,725
Speaker 6:  problem right now but it still a way better experience than right now.

448
00:26:38,985 --> 00:26:40,245
Speaker 6:  So we're working through it.

449
00:26:40,955 --> 00:26:43,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I agree with that. I mean it is just really interesting. I think you're

450
00:26:43,285 --> 00:26:46,765
Speaker 2:  exactly right that yeah at some point there is the one thing

451
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:50,325
Speaker 2:  and the question of what the one thing should be, I don't know that we know

452
00:26:50,325 --> 00:26:52,845
Speaker 2:  yet. I don't know that we've answered it and I think the idea of it being

453
00:26:52,885 --> 00:26:56,525
Speaker 2:  a a hardware thing that lives on my keyring makes a lot of sense but has

454
00:26:56,725 --> 00:26:59,485
Speaker 2:  downsides. There's like the perfect version of it. It would be like it lives

455
00:26:59,545 --> 00:27:03,525
Speaker 2:  in a safe somewhere far away where no one can get to it but that obviously

456
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:05,165
Speaker 2:  is a disastrous user experience

457
00:27:05,225 --> 00:27:07,565
Speaker 6:  But also somehow you can get to it. Right?

458
00:27:07,565 --> 00:27:11,485
Speaker 2:  Exactly. I I can teleport into it when necessary but that's it. Yeah

459
00:27:11,525 --> 00:27:15,085
Speaker 2:  I don't Do you have any sense of what the best available version of that

460
00:27:15,105 --> 00:27:18,405
Speaker 2:  is? Is it your phone at the moment? Like the the device you have?

461
00:27:18,675 --> 00:27:22,405
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I think the current state of that is, you know, we recommend that

462
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:26,405
Speaker 6:  your passkey four one password lives in whatever your platform

463
00:27:26,405 --> 00:27:30,125
Speaker 6:  account is or UBI key, right in your iCloud, your Google. We typically recommend

464
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:33,565
Speaker 6:  that you have a backup because obviously If you lose it. It's just kind of

465
00:27:33,605 --> 00:27:36,845
Speaker 6:  a pain to be honest to recover If you kind of lose that master one. So we

466
00:27:37,085 --> 00:27:39,845
Speaker 6:  recommend you have some backups and so that's kind of the state of the world

467
00:27:39,845 --> 00:27:43,765
Speaker 6:  right now. I think in an ideal world it's something much more about your

468
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:47,965
Speaker 6:  real life identity like your, your human identity that can identify you to

469
00:27:48,205 --> 00:27:51,165
Speaker 6:  a computer, right? And like none of that stuff is real yet. But there's a

470
00:27:51,165 --> 00:27:54,725
Speaker 6:  lot of really exciting things that people think about in The future and are

471
00:27:54,725 --> 00:27:58,645
Speaker 6:  working on of ways to kind of like tie those things together but in a way

472
00:27:58,645 --> 00:28:02,485
Speaker 6:  that also still is like privacy preserving in in

473
00:28:02,485 --> 00:28:06,365
Speaker 6:  some way, right? It still protects your identity online but it makes it

474
00:28:06,725 --> 00:28:10,045
Speaker 6:  a stronger sense of who you actually are on the internet. And

475
00:28:10,265 --> 00:28:14,125
Speaker 2:  How broad can passkey be in that sense? I mean you mentioned wanting

476
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:17,285
Speaker 2:  to log people in quicker and and making the case that they, they're more

477
00:28:17,285 --> 00:28:20,045
Speaker 2:  likely to complete transactions that way, right? I just think about the number

478
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:23,965
Speaker 2:  of carts I have left Unpurchased because typing in

479
00:28:23,965 --> 00:28:27,205
Speaker 2:  my address and credit card number is really annoying. Like much less setting

480
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:31,005
Speaker 2:  up an account. even that like guest flow is a giant pan, can Passkeys

481
00:28:31,005 --> 00:28:34,645
Speaker 2:  be a store of information beyond passwords in that sense?

482
00:28:34,905 --> 00:28:36,485
Speaker 2:  Is that even a thing people are thinking about?

483
00:28:37,225 --> 00:28:41,005
Speaker 6:  It definitely is. It's not really inherent in pass keys themselves

484
00:28:41,065 --> 00:28:44,925
Speaker 6:  but there's a lot of sort of like additional like wallet type of technology

485
00:28:45,185 --> 00:28:48,485
Speaker 6:  or other types of technology that people are talking about and working on

486
00:28:48,485 --> 00:28:51,205
Speaker 6:  that is kind of like that where it's more about other information that's

487
00:28:51,205 --> 00:28:55,165
Speaker 6:  being stored. It's almost like that password manager experience, right? Where

488
00:28:55,165 --> 00:28:58,805
Speaker 6:  you can store your address and your credit card information to autofill

489
00:28:58,805 --> 00:29:01,645
Speaker 6:  because no one likes that. I don't wanna have to make an account, I wanna

490
00:29:01,645 --> 00:29:04,285
Speaker 6:  be able to check out as a guest but I don't wanna type all that information.

491
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:07,765
Speaker 6:  So there is a lot of work to be done on like doing that in a more like cryptographic

492
00:29:07,905 --> 00:29:11,685
Speaker 6:  secure way like passkey. But the technology as it exists

493
00:29:11,685 --> 00:29:14,845
Speaker 6:  today doesn't really support that just yet. It's really exciting though.

494
00:29:15,425 --> 00:29:18,605
Speaker 2:  It is really exciting. I mean and that's the kind of thing if it goes from

495
00:29:18,885 --> 00:29:21,725
Speaker 2:  I have to type in all of this information about me on the internet over and

496
00:29:21,725 --> 00:29:25,685
Speaker 2:  over ad nauseum to I have a secure version of all the relevant information

497
00:29:25,685 --> 00:29:29,325
Speaker 2:  about me and I can just dole it out in secure ways whenever I need it.

498
00:29:29,955 --> 00:29:33,045
Speaker 2:  Like that's just a better internet. That's how, that's how this should all

499
00:29:33,045 --> 00:29:33,445
Speaker 2:  work. Yes.

500
00:29:33,445 --> 00:29:35,085
Speaker 6:  That's the dream. Yes and

501
00:29:35,085 --> 00:29:38,885
Speaker 2:  It does seem like increasingly the companies who are storing

502
00:29:38,885 --> 00:29:41,965
Speaker 2:  things like my home address and my credit card information and my password

503
00:29:42,335 --> 00:29:45,605
Speaker 2:  don't want that anymore because it's a security risk. Like I can't imagine

504
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:49,525
Speaker 2:  if I'm Best Buy or Home Depot, I want any of the risk that comes with that

505
00:29:49,525 --> 00:29:53,125
Speaker 2:  anymore. So I would think most of these businesses would be psyched to figure

506
00:29:53,185 --> 00:29:54,765
Speaker 2:  out how to make this stuff work, right?

507
00:29:55,035 --> 00:29:58,645
Speaker 6:  Yeah I think that's the same way that companies would wanna get rid of

508
00:29:58,885 --> 00:30:02,605
Speaker 6:  passwords or any really like PII they're storing, right? If they can offload

509
00:30:02,785 --> 00:30:06,245
Speaker 6:  any of that risk and not have a giant database table

510
00:30:06,515 --> 00:30:10,165
Speaker 6:  full of something that people are looking for, you know, I think that's

511
00:30:10,165 --> 00:30:13,725
Speaker 6:  obviously a win, right? And So I think Passkey solve that

512
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:17,845
Speaker 6:  security benefit. The sort of compliance regulations around like there's

513
00:30:17,845 --> 00:30:21,365
Speaker 6:  a lot of good reasons and I think it's the companies who are

514
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:25,485
Speaker 6:  excited to make a like user and security

515
00:30:25,595 --> 00:30:28,925
Speaker 6:  improvement. Like those are the companies that I'm seeing like most excited

516
00:30:28,925 --> 00:30:29,805
Speaker 6:  about Passkeys.

517
00:30:30,225 --> 00:30:33,965
Speaker 2:  So If you fast forward, I dunno 2, 5, 10 years, however long it takes for

518
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:37,645
Speaker 2:  passkeys to become like truly mainstream. Is there any

519
00:30:38,155 --> 00:30:41,765
Speaker 2:  case left for either having a Password that I type

520
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:45,845
Speaker 2:  into a website or the flip side having like the

521
00:30:45,895 --> 00:30:49,605
Speaker 2:  login with Google login with Apple stuff like as passkeys get really good,

522
00:30:49,675 --> 00:30:53,365
Speaker 2:  does everything else disappear or do those things kind of have

523
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:54,365
Speaker 2:  their place too?

524
00:30:54,835 --> 00:30:58,525
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I think passwords are never really gonna

525
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:02,205
Speaker 6:  fully go away, but I would hope that maybe like

526
00:31:02,205 --> 00:31:05,565
Speaker 6:  90% of passwords can go away. Especially for

527
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:09,765
Speaker 6:  the types of apps that we as people just like use every day, right? Our

528
00:31:09,895 --> 00:31:13,645
Speaker 6:  banks are Netflix, our online shopping, like those

529
00:31:13,725 --> 00:31:17,245
Speaker 6:  types of things I think are kind of perfect use cases for

530
00:31:17,635 --> 00:31:21,405
Speaker 6:  passkey. I think there's a lot of good uses for more like social login,

531
00:31:21,515 --> 00:31:25,085
Speaker 6:  like a login with Google or something like that because maybe they need access

532
00:31:25,085 --> 00:31:28,205
Speaker 6:  to your email, you're sharing other types of information that you get from

533
00:31:28,205 --> 00:31:31,525
Speaker 6:  having that connection. And then there'll probably always be some apps that

534
00:31:31,525 --> 00:31:35,485
Speaker 6:  just use passwords and maybe it's a password and a passkey as

535
00:31:35,525 --> 00:31:38,925
Speaker 6:  a second factor of authentication or something like that. But I would hope

536
00:31:38,925 --> 00:31:42,205
Speaker 6:  that you know, for most of the things you're using every day we could get

537
00:31:42,205 --> 00:31:44,885
Speaker 6:  to a point where passkey are working for those types of apps.

538
00:31:46,435 --> 00:31:46,925
Speaker 5:  Alright,

539
00:31:46,985 --> 00:31:50,045
Speaker 2:  We gotta take a break and then we're gonna talk about wearables. We'll be

540
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:50,405
Speaker 2:  right back.

541
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:31,685
Speaker 2:  Welcome back over the last couple of years it feels like the wearable industry

542
00:33:31,705 --> 00:33:35,565
Speaker 2:  has boomed. You have the Apple Watch and the Pixel Watch and the Galaxy Watch

543
00:33:35,665 --> 00:33:39,605
Speaker 2:  all getting pretty popular and pretty good but it also feels like the wearable

544
00:33:39,845 --> 00:33:43,765
Speaker 2:  industry has kind of died. I don't know, it just feels like a few years ago

545
00:33:43,765 --> 00:33:47,685
Speaker 2:  there was all this energy to bring tech to our bodies and give us

546
00:33:47,685 --> 00:33:51,325
Speaker 2:  stuff to hold and wear and clip on that would do all kinds of

547
00:33:51,965 --> 00:33:55,925
Speaker 2:  computery things on our bodies in simpler ways. And now there's

548
00:33:55,925 --> 00:33:59,365
Speaker 2:  just smartwatches and they're basically all just health devices and that's

549
00:33:59,365 --> 00:34:03,285
Speaker 2:  just what there is now. So is this just the way it goes from

550
00:34:03,285 --> 00:34:07,005
Speaker 2:  now on? Is this what the wearables industry has become and will be forever?

551
00:34:07,465 --> 00:34:10,725
Speaker 2:  To help me figure it out, I grabbed vs song who is the verges wearables reviewer

552
00:34:10,725 --> 00:34:14,325
Speaker 2:  and the person wearing the most gadgets at any given time that I have ever

553
00:34:14,325 --> 00:34:17,005
Speaker 2:  met in my entire life. Fi Welcome back.

554
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:17,525
Speaker 8:  Hi.

555
00:34:17,945 --> 00:34:19,765
Speaker 2:  How many wearables do you have on you right now?

556
00:34:20,195 --> 00:34:20,485
Speaker 8:  Four.

557
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:22,965
Speaker 2:  What are they? Are you allowed to talk about all four of them?

558
00:34:23,345 --> 00:34:27,245
Speaker 8:  Yes. Okay, I have the Wang Scan watch light. Okay I have the Apple Watch

559
00:34:27,335 --> 00:34:31,125
Speaker 8:  Ultra two, the O Ring Gen three and the E

560
00:34:31,155 --> 00:34:31,445
Speaker 8:  ring.

561
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:32,125
Speaker 2:  Okay.

562
00:34:32,385 --> 00:34:33,885
Speaker 8:  Two smartwatches, two smart rings,

563
00:34:34,275 --> 00:34:37,965
Speaker 2:  Pure redundancy. So many things counting your step

564
00:34:38,265 --> 00:34:40,445
Speaker 2:  and giving you dubious information about your sleep.

565
00:34:40,515 --> 00:34:44,485
Speaker 8:  Yeah, yeah it, it's what we like to call a control device. So.

566
00:34:44,525 --> 00:34:48,005
Speaker 8:  I actually use the ora ring to test all like sleep tracking. Okay. Just because

567
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:51,245
Speaker 8:  they're like, oh where sleep tracker, they're pretty accurate for certain

568
00:34:51,245 --> 00:34:54,845
Speaker 8:  metrics. So I have that and my bed also tracks sleeping.

569
00:34:55,065 --> 00:34:59,005
Speaker 8:  So there's just a lot of control devices to control for accuracy. There you

570
00:34:59,005 --> 00:34:59,325
Speaker 8:  go. So do

571
00:34:59,325 --> 00:35:02,245
Speaker 2:  You wake up in the morning and get like six different scores on how you slept?

572
00:35:02,545 --> 00:35:02,765
Speaker 2:  Yes,

573
00:35:02,965 --> 00:35:03,965
Speaker 8:  I do. That sounds awful.

574
00:35:04,145 --> 00:35:06,285
Speaker 2:  It I, one score stresses me out. I

575
00:35:06,285 --> 00:35:10,005
Speaker 8:  Get like six different scores and then while I'm brushing my teeth I

576
00:35:10,005 --> 00:35:13,285
Speaker 8:  compare all of them and I go oh you're not accurate or

577
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:17,725
Speaker 8:  that sort of stuff. So yeah, so that's the, the behind the scenes of

578
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:19,165
Speaker 8:  wearables testing. That's

579
00:35:19,165 --> 00:35:22,605
Speaker 2:  Good stuff. I gave up on sleep tracking like the third day that I woke up

580
00:35:22,605 --> 00:35:25,845
Speaker 2:  feeling like crap and it was like congratulations on hitting your sleep goal.

581
00:35:26,075 --> 00:35:28,805
Speaker 2:  It's like I don't know if I did or didn't but Screw you

582
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:32,805
Speaker 8:  To, to be fair, like a lot of sleep tracking is kind of dubious in terms

583
00:35:32,825 --> 00:35:36,405
Speaker 8:  of accuracy. Yeah it's not, you know when you usually take a grain of salt

584
00:35:36,405 --> 00:35:39,925
Speaker 8:  take two with sleep tracking Fair. So that's just how it's, yeah.

585
00:35:40,075 --> 00:35:43,565
Speaker 2:  Okay. But I wanna talk about like the state of wearables 'cause it, I feel

586
00:35:43,565 --> 00:35:46,005
Speaker 2:  like there's been a bunch of news about wearables in the last few weeks.

587
00:35:46,005 --> 00:35:49,965
Speaker 2:  There was a bunch of stuff at CES, we're in kind of a weird place right

588
00:35:49,965 --> 00:35:52,765
Speaker 2:  now and I have, I have a bunch of theories about this, but let's start with

589
00:35:52,765 --> 00:35:56,405
Speaker 2:  Fossil. 'cause I feel like Fossil as a company was trying to do

590
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:59,845
Speaker 2:  something different and interesting and had a really sort of

591
00:36:00,155 --> 00:36:02,365
Speaker 2:  cool idea about what smartwatches could be.

592
00:36:02,825 --> 00:36:06,765
Speaker 8:  So you know it's, it's really sad that Fossil is now a Fossil but

593
00:36:06,825 --> 00:36:09,445
Speaker 8:  I'm ch but like well

594
00:36:09,445 --> 00:36:10,765
Speaker 2:  That's broadcast everybody. I

595
00:36:10,765 --> 00:36:14,565
Speaker 8:  Didn't make that joke in the actual headlines. So I had to do it elsewhere

596
00:36:14,565 --> 00:36:18,165
Speaker 8:  because everyone else was making that joke at me. But so Fossil basically

597
00:36:18,195 --> 00:36:22,125
Speaker 8:  kept wear os afloat like almost by itself. 'cause

598
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:25,805
Speaker 8:  Fossil is not just Fossil, it's Diesel, it's Skain, it's all these other

599
00:36:25,935 --> 00:36:29,765
Speaker 8:  sub-brands. And for the longest time If you bought a Wear Os watch, it was

600
00:36:29,885 --> 00:36:33,605
Speaker 8:  a Fossil. So they kind of kept Google going

601
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:37,445
Speaker 8:  through all of that time. And so for them to actually just like call

602
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:41,085
Speaker 8:  it quits to completely exit the smartwatch industry,

603
00:36:41,585 --> 00:36:45,365
Speaker 8:  that's really big. It's kind of just, wow, it,

604
00:36:45,385 --> 00:36:49,285
Speaker 8:  it says a lot about where smartwatches are at this point in time and that

605
00:36:49,355 --> 00:36:53,205
Speaker 8:  it's like, you know, there used to be this notion that Apple

606
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:56,925
Speaker 8:  was, its closed garden and Apple was the main smartwatch of toys for

607
00:36:57,145 --> 00:37:01,085
Speaker 8:  iOS users. But it's sort of happening in the where West space now too

608
00:37:01,105 --> 00:37:04,485
Speaker 8:  for Android. Because it used to be that, you know, Android was the wild west

609
00:37:04,505 --> 00:37:08,365
Speaker 8:  of smartwatches, kind of like phones, right? But now it's Google and Samsung

610
00:37:08,755 --> 00:37:12,645
Speaker 8:  also kind of like phones. So that's, that's just kind of where we are.

611
00:37:12,825 --> 00:37:16,645
Speaker 8:  And Fossil leaving it kind of cements that and I'm actually pretty

612
00:37:16,705 --> 00:37:17,325
Speaker 8:  sad about it.

613
00:37:17,605 --> 00:37:21,045
Speaker 2:  I am too. 'cause it seems like, and I'm realizing now how long ago this was,

614
00:37:21,065 --> 00:37:24,725
Speaker 2:  but If, you go back to like 2017, maybe

615
00:37:24,725 --> 00:37:27,925
Speaker 2:  20 16, 17, there was this idea that

616
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:32,245
Speaker 2:  all watches or at least many watches of many different styles, many different

617
00:37:32,245 --> 00:37:35,685
Speaker 2:  price points, whatever, were going to become some kind of smart, right? Yeah.

618
00:37:35,685 --> 00:37:39,445
Speaker 2:  There was gonna be this whole interesting spectrum where I remember I went

619
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:42,725
Speaker 2:  to, I think it's called Basel World, this like very fancy watch show in Switzer.

620
00:37:42,725 --> 00:37:42,925
Speaker 2:  Yes.

621
00:37:42,925 --> 00:37:43,205
Speaker 8:  That world.

622
00:37:43,205 --> 00:37:46,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And it was, it was like the year everybody was into

623
00:37:46,805 --> 00:37:50,045
Speaker 2:  smartwatches, So, I was wired at the time. And I'm sitting down with all

624
00:37:50,045 --> 00:37:53,405
Speaker 2:  these people as they're explaining like the beautiful history behind this

625
00:37:53,405 --> 00:37:56,885
Speaker 2:  $12,000 watch. And then they'd be like, and also Bluetooth wired it. I was

626
00:37:56,885 --> 00:38:00,565
Speaker 2:  like, alright cool. But I liked that idea and it was like Withings was doing

627
00:38:00,565 --> 00:38:03,165
Speaker 2:  cool stuff with that, this kind of like hybrid smartwatch idea where it looked

628
00:38:03,165 --> 00:38:07,125
Speaker 2:  like a watch, it looked like a piece of jewelry but also still had

629
00:38:07,355 --> 00:38:11,165
Speaker 2:  some tech in it. And it feels like everything on that spectrum that isn't

630
00:38:11,165 --> 00:38:13,685
Speaker 2:  an Apple watch or something that looks like an Apple watch is just gone.

631
00:38:13,715 --> 00:38:15,765
Speaker 2:  Like we've just given up on that idea almost entirely.

632
00:38:15,985 --> 00:38:19,925
Speaker 8:  It is really weird because for right now, I, in the last couple of years

633
00:38:20,245 --> 00:38:24,085
Speaker 8:  actually, smartwatches have just like slowly consumed everything. Like where

634
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:27,565
Speaker 8:  has the budget fitness tracker gone? China, that's it, right? Like that's,

635
00:38:27,565 --> 00:38:31,445
Speaker 8:  that's where most of them are at the moment. And it used to be that Fitbit

636
00:38:31,505 --> 00:38:35,285
Speaker 8:  had its own, Fitbit was the word that everyone used,

637
00:38:35,395 --> 00:38:37,685
Speaker 8:  even that it was a brand, they used it to mean fitness tracker.

638
00:38:37,685 --> 00:38:40,085
Speaker 2:  It was Kleenex. Like in a really real way it was Kleenex. Yes.

639
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:42,965
Speaker 8:  That's, that's what Fitbit was. And now, now where's, now where's Fitbit?

640
00:38:42,965 --> 00:38:46,885
Speaker 8:  James Park has left right very suddenly during CES I like woke up and I was

641
00:38:46,885 --> 00:38:50,645
Speaker 8:  like, are are you kidding me? I met CES please. Are you kidding me right

642
00:38:50,645 --> 00:38:54,525
Speaker 8:  now? But yes, so that's kind of where Fitbit is and it is really

643
00:38:54,525 --> 00:38:57,925
Speaker 8:  just the Apple watch, the Galaxy Watch or the Pixel Watch at this moment

644
00:38:57,945 --> 00:39:01,565
Speaker 8:  in time. And that's really sad. But to your point, Fossil really

645
00:39:02,085 --> 00:39:05,885
Speaker 8:  embodied that idea of we are gonna have so many different smartwatches in

646
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:09,045
Speaker 8:  so many different form factors and so many different like styles. There was

647
00:39:09,045 --> 00:39:12,965
Speaker 8:  the Kate Spade watch, there was the, they bought Misfit for a

648
00:39:12,965 --> 00:39:15,045
Speaker 8:  while. It used to be oh Misfit, right? They had

649
00:39:15,185 --> 00:39:16,125
Speaker 2:  So many cool ideas

650
00:39:16,435 --> 00:39:19,685
Speaker 8:  They did and like the the touch bezel that Samsung

651
00:39:19,835 --> 00:39:23,485
Speaker 8:  basically managed to actually execute and all of that stuff. But

652
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:26,965
Speaker 8:  there used to be a joke I would tell my editors and it's like, it's a trade

653
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:30,565
Speaker 8:  show. I'm gonna go to Fossil. But, and I did this at Gizmoto a few times

654
00:39:30,685 --> 00:39:33,485
Speaker 8:  where I was like, I'm not gonna cover every single watch that they release

655
00:39:33,485 --> 00:39:36,725
Speaker 8:  because there's gonna be 20 of them. I'm just going to take a picture and

656
00:39:36,745 --> 00:39:39,845
Speaker 8:  say look at all the freaking smartwatches that Fossil has brought. And they

657
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:43,565
Speaker 8:  would come to each trade show with I wanna say like 20 to 30

658
00:39:43,565 --> 00:39:46,765
Speaker 8:  different watches and I'd be in a room and I'd be like, okay, what's new

659
00:39:46,765 --> 00:39:50,445
Speaker 8:  about this watch, this watch is that watch but Armani right Or

660
00:39:50,515 --> 00:39:54,365
Speaker 8:  this watch is that watch but diesel and you know, that kind of gets to

661
00:39:54,365 --> 00:39:56,565
Speaker 8:  the, the problem of the Fossil watches as well. Well yeah

662
00:39:56,785 --> 00:40:00,005
Speaker 2:  So but diagnose that for me 'cause I think you could make the case that that

663
00:40:00,005 --> 00:40:02,805
Speaker 2:  is actually like an awesome outcome, right? Like nobody's mad that there

664
00:40:02,805 --> 00:40:05,925
Speaker 2:  are lots of different brands of T-shirt that are all T-shirts. Like that's

665
00:40:06,105 --> 00:40:08,925
Speaker 2:  how it should work. It's fashion. It lets you make choices. And we were in

666
00:40:08,925 --> 00:40:12,365
Speaker 2:  this moment where technology was just gonna be sort of integrated into that.

667
00:40:12,665 --> 00:40:16,365
Speaker 2:  And I liked the idea of having a watch that seemed like a watch but would

668
00:40:16,435 --> 00:40:20,365
Speaker 2:  also buzz when I got a phone call and count my steps. Like that to

669
00:40:20,365 --> 00:40:23,965
Speaker 2:  me was almost everything I wanted from a smart watch. And that has

670
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:28,125
Speaker 2:  died and I, what I can't tell is which of the many things that

671
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:31,045
Speaker 2:  went wrong are the real problem. Like I think there's a thing where Google

672
00:40:31,045 --> 00:40:34,805
Speaker 2:  neglected ow s For a really long time and sort of hung Fossil and a bunch

673
00:40:34,805 --> 00:40:37,645
Speaker 2:  of other companies out to dry. Yeah. There's a thing where maybe people just

674
00:40:37,645 --> 00:40:40,845
Speaker 2:  didn't want those things. And maybe I'm wrong in the people who wanted any

675
00:40:40,845 --> 00:40:44,085
Speaker 2:  kind of technology on their wrist wanted all the technology on their wrist.

676
00:40:44,085 --> 00:40:46,885
Speaker 2:  So the Apple Watch and the Pixel Watch became the thing, I don't know what's

677
00:40:46,885 --> 00:40:48,405
Speaker 2:  your read of like why that all fell apart?

678
00:40:48,675 --> 00:40:52,605
Speaker 8:  It's a lot of of those things in small increments. Okay. So it is

679
00:40:52,605 --> 00:40:56,445
Speaker 8:  like a fact that Fossil invested so much into to the Google system

680
00:40:56,865 --> 00:40:59,925
Speaker 8:  and then, you know, a couple years back Google took about

681
00:40:59,935 --> 00:41:03,885
Speaker 8:  $40 million worth of Fossil R and d and brought it over into Google,

682
00:41:03,885 --> 00:41:07,725
Speaker 8:  right? So that was kind of one of the first big signals that

683
00:41:07,725 --> 00:41:11,005
Speaker 8:  Google was gonna start taking wearables seriously again. But you know, it

684
00:41:11,005 --> 00:41:14,045
Speaker 8:  kind of gutted Fossil a little bit. And then another problem with Fossil

685
00:41:14,185 --> 00:41:17,525
Speaker 8:  is that the price for the price that you were getting their watches, you

686
00:41:17,525 --> 00:41:21,205
Speaker 8:  got a software that was kind of not so

687
00:41:21,255 --> 00:41:24,445
Speaker 8:  great. Yeah. Is what it, it was very like jittery

688
00:41:24,965 --> 00:41:28,565
Speaker 8:  things would work and then they wouldn't, and more often they wouldn't, the

689
00:41:28,565 --> 00:41:32,005
Speaker 8:  battery life was eh, so you were just getting a better

690
00:41:32,015 --> 00:41:35,965
Speaker 8:  experience on other smartwatches but paying a similar

691
00:41:36,015 --> 00:41:39,765
Speaker 8:  price. So what you really were paying for was the style and the fashion and

692
00:41:39,765 --> 00:41:43,485
Speaker 8:  the fact that it didn't look, you know, like this this giant slab of phone

693
00:41:43,505 --> 00:41:46,845
Speaker 8:  on your wrist. Right? You were, you were paying for a watch that looked like

694
00:41:46,885 --> 00:41:50,845
Speaker 8:  a watch. And then I think another aspect of it is that the people who are

695
00:41:51,165 --> 00:41:54,925
Speaker 8:  gonna go for something like Withings and the the hybrids is that they are

696
00:41:54,925 --> 00:41:58,765
Speaker 8:  people who are not going to be buying on an upgrade cycle very

697
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,325
Speaker 8:  frequently. These things. True.

698
00:42:00,325 --> 00:42:02,765
Speaker 2:  You don't buy a nice watch intending to replace it in two years.

699
00:42:02,795 --> 00:42:06,645
Speaker 8:  Exactly. Yeah. And the battery lasts a long time. Like this has been lasting

700
00:42:06,645 --> 00:42:09,525
Speaker 8:  me for I wanna say two weeks. Yeah, that's awesome. Like I haven't charged

701
00:42:09,525 --> 00:42:12,045
Speaker 8:  it. That's, I want, I made it up, that's what I want. And that is what a

702
00:42:12,045 --> 00:42:15,485
Speaker 8:  lot of people want, but those people aren't the ones going out buying and

703
00:42:15,485 --> 00:42:19,405
Speaker 8:  upgrading every single year. Right. So that's not making the company a lot

704
00:42:19,405 --> 00:42:23,325
Speaker 8:  of money. So it's, it's one of those paradoxes where planned obsolescence

705
00:42:23,345 --> 00:42:27,165
Speaker 8:  is a shittier product but it makes, but it makes the company a lot more

706
00:42:27,165 --> 00:42:30,925
Speaker 8:  money. Yeah. So that's kind of the conflict that you have there. And

707
00:42:31,045 --> 00:42:34,885
Speaker 8:  I just think the other issue with where OS three and

708
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:38,405
Speaker 8:  that transition is that Google clearly put Samsung first

709
00:42:38,845 --> 00:42:42,205
Speaker 8:  'cause everything comes to a Samsung watch first. Right. And then it'll come

710
00:42:42,205 --> 00:42:46,085
Speaker 8:  to Google and then everybody who isn't Samsung or Google kind of gets the

711
00:42:46,085 --> 00:42:49,845
Speaker 8:  short end of the stick mob. Voy was the other really well-known

712
00:42:50,565 --> 00:42:54,365
Speaker 8:  Wear Os watch alternative and they didn't get Wear

713
00:42:54,465 --> 00:42:58,205
Speaker 8:  os three upgrade until, I wanna say December. Oh wow. This

714
00:42:58,235 --> 00:43:01,925
Speaker 8:  like this past December. Yes. It was a thing where Mob Voy users were like,

715
00:43:01,925 --> 00:43:05,645
Speaker 8:  Hey, you told us that if we were gonna buy this particular tick watch with

716
00:43:05,805 --> 00:43:09,605
Speaker 8:  the 4,100 chip we were going to get wear West three.

717
00:43:10,105 --> 00:43:13,885
Speaker 8:  And basically they waited until December, that's when the, the

718
00:43:13,885 --> 00:43:17,445
Speaker 8:  rollout happened and wear West Four is already here. Right.

719
00:43:17,825 --> 00:43:20,805
Speaker 8:  So now they're just like a generation behind, they're barely catching up

720
00:43:20,805 --> 00:43:24,725
Speaker 8:  and they don't even have Google Assistant on their wrist. Oof. And Fossil

721
00:43:25,345 --> 00:43:28,685
Speaker 8:  did have where Google Assistant, but they also had to wait a really long

722
00:43:28,685 --> 00:43:32,445
Speaker 8:  time to get that rollout out. So I can understand where from fossil's perspective,

723
00:43:32,475 --> 00:43:36,245
Speaker 8:  they were just like, okay, we didn't even know where OS three was happening

724
00:43:36,295 --> 00:43:40,245
Speaker 8:  until you announced it. Right. What the hell? Yeah. So, you know,

725
00:43:40,525 --> 00:43:44,365
Speaker 8:  I had a sense something was ki something was not kosher. 'cause

726
00:43:44,365 --> 00:43:48,125
Speaker 8:  Fossil had a very, very regular update cadence and they missed it.

727
00:43:48,155 --> 00:43:51,885
Speaker 8:  Like 2023 was when the gen seven, if it was gonna come out, was gonna come

728
00:43:51,885 --> 00:43:54,005
Speaker 8:  out nothing. Hmm. I reached

729
00:43:54,025 --> 00:43:56,925
Speaker 2:  And they really were the one company you could rely on to keep caring about

730
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:57,605
Speaker 2:  this for a

731
00:43:57,605 --> 00:44:01,165
Speaker 8:  Long time every single year. So CES is up and down with wearables, but every

732
00:44:01,525 --> 00:44:04,525
Speaker 8:  single year it would be, I would reach out to Fossil and be like, Hey guys,

733
00:44:04,525 --> 00:44:08,245
Speaker 8:  what you got going? And they're like, Hey, here's what we got going. And

734
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:11,085
Speaker 8:  this year I reached out and they're like, we're not gonna be at CES. And

735
00:44:11,085 --> 00:44:14,725
Speaker 8:  I was like, excuse me, hold up the the whos, he was like, so many

736
00:44:14,835 --> 00:44:18,805
Speaker 8:  just alarm bells were going off. And I think I reached out to them end of

737
00:44:18,965 --> 00:44:22,845
Speaker 8:  November, early December and we were talking for a while and it wasn't

738
00:44:22,895 --> 00:44:26,285
Speaker 8:  until after CES even that they got back to me and they're like, Hey,

739
00:44:27,025 --> 00:44:29,005
Speaker 8:  we out. So,

740
00:44:29,675 --> 00:44:33,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. So that makes me sad. I have to say. And the other part that

741
00:44:33,205 --> 00:44:36,885
Speaker 2:  makes me sad is I think we like skipped past the fitness

742
00:44:37,115 --> 00:44:40,005
Speaker 2:  band thing way too quickly. This is a thing you and I have talked about before

743
00:44:40,365 --> 00:44:43,685
Speaker 2:  and I, I still believe this very strongly, that like the original Jawbone

744
00:44:43,825 --> 00:44:47,685
Speaker 2:  up was a perfect gadget and there should be more of them. And

745
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:50,885
Speaker 2:  I don't wanna watch, but I want something on my wrist that tracks basic things.

746
00:44:51,435 --> 00:44:55,205
Speaker 2:  What it seems to be is that instead of bands rings are gonna be that

747
00:44:55,205 --> 00:44:58,965
Speaker 2:  thing. Like it, it seems like the big bet now is that if we're gonna do a

748
00:44:59,015 --> 00:45:03,005
Speaker 2:  non-screen, long lasting, simple kind

749
00:45:03,005 --> 00:45:05,765
Speaker 2:  of wearable, everybody seems to think rings are the thing.

750
00:45:06,285 --> 00:45:10,245
Speaker 8:  I mean, rings are big this year at CES there were more rings than I

751
00:45:10,245 --> 00:45:12,845
Speaker 8:  could count. I would be like, do do, do, I've seen all the rings and then

752
00:45:12,865 --> 00:45:16,765
Speaker 8:  I'd turn and I'd be like, Nope, there's more rings. And like from names that

753
00:45:16,805 --> 00:45:18,765
Speaker 8:  I had never heard of before. So I was like, oh, is

754
00:45:18,765 --> 00:45:21,365
Speaker 2:  It just because Aura worked? Like Aura's been in this for a few years, the

755
00:45:21,365 --> 00:45:24,125
Speaker 2:  product seems to do really well. I feel like the, the like viral marketing

756
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:27,405
Speaker 2:  for Aura is very good. 'cause you, you watch a podcast or you see somebody

757
00:45:27,405 --> 00:45:31,325
Speaker 2:  on TV and it's like a tech CEO and a vest and there's like a one in

758
00:45:31,325 --> 00:45:33,205
Speaker 2:  two chance they have an aura ring on. And

759
00:45:33,205 --> 00:45:36,965
Speaker 8:  It's not just the tech people, it's the celebrities. Jennifer Anon has true

760
00:45:36,965 --> 00:45:39,885
Speaker 8:  an aura ring. A bunch of sports stars have it. There was a period of time

761
00:45:39,885 --> 00:45:43,645
Speaker 8:  where I think Kim Kardashian and Gwyneth Paltrow maybe

762
00:45:43,715 --> 00:45:47,165
Speaker 8:  Okay. Where having a sleep competition with their auras and these people

763
00:45:47,165 --> 00:45:49,765
Speaker 8:  have millions of followers on Instagram. Yeah. And they were just like, ha

764
00:45:49,765 --> 00:45:53,605
Speaker 8:  ha beat you in my Instagram stories. So Aura really had this, like

765
00:45:53,745 --> 00:45:57,565
Speaker 8:  Prince Harry has, has an aura ring. So they had a lot of

766
00:45:57,635 --> 00:46:01,525
Speaker 8:  buzz in that respect, but they weren't the only smart ring around. They just

767
00:46:01,555 --> 00:46:05,205
Speaker 8:  kind of RIP motive. That was a smart ring, right? Yeah.

768
00:46:05,385 --> 00:46:09,325
Speaker 8:  Had two, there was the motive and the motive ring two and they just kind

769
00:46:09,325 --> 00:46:13,205
Speaker 8:  of like killed them. Mm. So to speak. And it was actually

770
00:46:13,205 --> 00:46:17,045
Speaker 8:  really quiet in the smart ring space for several years. And

771
00:46:17,045 --> 00:46:20,485
Speaker 8:  that's because smart rings compared to fitness bands have a lot of technological

772
00:46:20,805 --> 00:46:24,645
Speaker 8:  challenges because they're so small. They're just so entirely small.

773
00:46:24,905 --> 00:46:28,885
Speaker 8:  But I think we're starting to figure that out. And then there are some

774
00:46:28,885 --> 00:46:32,765
Speaker 8:  health advantages to a smart ring compared to a fitness band

775
00:46:32,995 --> 00:46:36,005
Speaker 8:  that really make them good for sleep tracking and sleep tracking.

776
00:46:36,005 --> 00:46:38,285
Speaker 2:  And part of that is just like literally where it's placed on your body.

777
00:46:38,715 --> 00:46:42,245
Speaker 8:  Yeah. So actually your wrist is terrible for most

778
00:46:42,315 --> 00:46:43,045
Speaker 8:  metrics. you

779
00:46:43,045 --> 00:46:45,125
Speaker 2:  Know, I just learned this recently that they're like, oh, let's put all this

780
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:47,365
Speaker 2:  stuff on your wrist. even that your wrist is the worst.

781
00:46:47,795 --> 00:46:50,925
Speaker 8:  Yeah. So like the way these sensors work is that they're shining light into

782
00:46:50,925 --> 00:46:54,365
Speaker 8:  your skin and it's reflecting off of your blood. And so that's how they read

783
00:46:54,365 --> 00:46:57,045
Speaker 8:  your heart rate. It's, it's a proxy for your pulse, blah, yada, yada, yada.

784
00:46:57,045 --> 00:46:58,445
Speaker 8:  I've written about it a ton, just read my stuff.

785
00:47:00,105 --> 00:47:03,405
Speaker 8:  But the, the, the problem is, is that you have so many tendons, there's so

786
00:47:03,405 --> 00:47:07,205
Speaker 8:  much movement in your wrist that there's so much signal to noise that it's

787
00:47:07,275 --> 00:47:10,965
Speaker 8:  very difficult to get an accurate read. Which is why If, you have

788
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,925
Speaker 8:  a wrist based wearable and you're like, Hmm, this sounds wrong. That plays

789
00:47:13,925 --> 00:47:17,765
Speaker 8:  into it. But the underside of your finger is

790
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:21,805
Speaker 8:  a lot more ideal. There's a lot less noise. The skin on your palm

791
00:47:21,945 --> 00:47:25,165
Speaker 8:  no matter what, no matter how much melanin you have, the skin on your palm

792
00:47:25,165 --> 00:47:28,925
Speaker 8:  is a lot lighter. Sure. So it kind of removes your skin color

793
00:47:29,205 --> 00:47:33,005
Speaker 8:  a little bit as a barrier to accuracy. So there's just a lot of

794
00:47:33,005 --> 00:47:36,645
Speaker 8:  reasons. It's a lot more comfortable to wear. You wear rings anyway. See,

795
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:40,405
Speaker 8:  and when you're going to bed, you're not, I have had a lot of watches

796
00:47:40,475 --> 00:47:44,405
Speaker 8:  that are gigantic from Carmen, but you know, in the

797
00:47:44,405 --> 00:47:46,565
Speaker 8:  middle of the night I'll wake up and I'll rip it off 'cause it's uncomfortable.

798
00:47:46,795 --> 00:47:50,685
Speaker 8:  Sure. So sleep tracking has gotten a lot of popularity in the

799
00:47:50,685 --> 00:47:54,525
Speaker 8:  last few years. This is the ideal form factor for it. So that's kind of why.

800
00:47:54,555 --> 00:47:57,525
Speaker 2:  Sure. I, I agree with that. I will say the thing that I've had trouble with

801
00:47:57,555 --> 00:48:01,485
Speaker 2:  with rings and the aura in particular is one that I would

802
00:48:01,485 --> 00:48:04,565
Speaker 2:  say like every three months I'm like, I'm gonna become an aura person again.

803
00:48:04,565 --> 00:48:08,405
Speaker 2:  And I pull the one outta my drawer, I charge it, I put it on, I like it for

804
00:48:08,405 --> 00:48:10,605
Speaker 2:  the step tracking. I like it because the battery doesn't die all the time.

805
00:48:10,745 --> 00:48:13,365
Speaker 2:  I'm like forever being driven crazy. 'cause my Apple watch battery seems

806
00:48:13,365 --> 00:48:17,165
Speaker 2:  to always be dying no matter what is happening. It's always dying. And the

807
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:20,645
Speaker 2:  OA ring is like a sort of light tracker in a way that I really like. I cannot

808
00:48:20,835 --> 00:48:24,805
Speaker 2:  type with that thing on comfortably really. And part of that is probably

809
00:48:24,805 --> 00:48:27,365
Speaker 2:  just that I'm not used to it yet. In the same way that like when I started

810
00:48:27,365 --> 00:48:29,765
Speaker 2:  wearing a wedding ring, it took me a while to get used to it. Now I don't

811
00:48:29,765 --> 00:48:33,445
Speaker 2:  even notice it on my finger, but like it's a pretty chunky thing. I mean

812
00:48:33,445 --> 00:48:36,565
Speaker 2:  you can, and it bangs around on the palm rest of my computer. Like I grant

813
00:48:36,565 --> 00:48:39,245
Speaker 2:  that I'm not used to wearing chunky rings and lots of people are used to

814
00:48:39,245 --> 00:48:42,845
Speaker 2:  wearing chunky rings. but it, it was harder for me to get used to having

815
00:48:42,905 --> 00:48:44,965
Speaker 2:  on my body than I expected it to be actually.

816
00:48:45,035 --> 00:48:48,765
Speaker 8:  Well yeah, like if you're in fashion, you definitely have a statement ring,

817
00:48:48,765 --> 00:48:52,685
Speaker 8:  right? This is not statement ring size, but it is chunky. Like

818
00:48:52,805 --> 00:48:56,685
Speaker 8:  I have several rings on my finger right now and like the normal not

819
00:48:56,685 --> 00:49:00,045
Speaker 8:  smart rings are much thinner. Right. They're, it actually kind of looks funny

820
00:49:00,275 --> 00:49:02,845
Speaker 8:  when, when you, it's like that's what the smart ring is. I

821
00:49:02,845 --> 00:49:05,205
Speaker 2:  Mean it's like you're, you're wearing four rings and two of them look like

822
00:49:05,205 --> 00:49:05,805
Speaker 2:  brass knuckles

823
00:49:06,475 --> 00:49:09,445
Speaker 8:  Look like rings. That's basically, that's basically what it is. And a lot

824
00:49:09,445 --> 00:49:12,765
Speaker 8:  of that is the tech. Yeah. There's just like what you, it's a miracle that

825
00:49:12,765 --> 00:49:15,765
Speaker 8:  they can make it this small. It's actually a miracle that this particular

826
00:49:15,765 --> 00:49:19,485
Speaker 8:  version of the ora ring is completely round. That was a huge engineering

827
00:49:19,485 --> 00:49:19,725
Speaker 8:  challenge.

828
00:49:19,725 --> 00:49:21,245
Speaker 2:  Right. It had a little flat tire for a long time.

829
00:49:21,245 --> 00:49:23,845
Speaker 8:  Right. Yeah. The flat tire is where they put the battery. Mm. Because when

830
00:49:23,845 --> 00:49:27,245
Speaker 8:  you have a flexible battery it's very difficult to make it round. So there's

831
00:49:27,245 --> 00:49:30,525
Speaker 8:  just all these like technical challenges that come with smart rings

832
00:49:31,075 --> 00:49:34,845
Speaker 8:  that make them big. 'cause I'm like this, this is pretty good

833
00:49:35,025 --> 00:49:38,645
Speaker 8:  If. you think about what a smart ring is and I always get our readers

834
00:49:38,865 --> 00:49:42,845
Speaker 8:  and some people in my dms just like, I'm not getting it until it's as

835
00:49:42,845 --> 00:49:45,885
Speaker 8:  thin as a regular ring. It's like, okay, you'll be waiting for a while. Yeah.

836
00:49:46,115 --> 00:49:48,445
Speaker 8:  Like you'll be waiting for a very long time.

837
00:49:48,865 --> 00:49:52,605
Speaker 2:  So, but then in that case, I understand why these things would exist, right?

838
00:49:52,635 --> 00:49:56,445
Speaker 2:  Like the size of auras market makes sense to me. There are

839
00:49:56,445 --> 00:49:59,205
Speaker 2:  people who want the things that it offers. What I can't figure out is why

840
00:49:59,405 --> 00:50:02,805
Speaker 2:  somebody like Samsung would make this, because especially the thing we've

841
00:50:02,805 --> 00:50:06,285
Speaker 2:  learned over the last bunch of years is that like a, you're right,

842
00:50:06,285 --> 00:50:09,965
Speaker 2:  ecosystem is important, but B, the market even for a

843
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:13,885
Speaker 2:  smartwatch is significantly smaller than the market for a smartphone at least

844
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:17,565
Speaker 2:  right now. And then to take away all the computer stuff,

845
00:50:17,835 --> 00:50:21,005
Speaker 2:  even on a smartwatch and say, okay, this thing is just

846
00:50:21,395 --> 00:50:25,285
Speaker 2:  basically a lightweight tracker. It just feels like that, that just

847
00:50:25,285 --> 00:50:28,765
Speaker 2:  seems like a thing that cannot possibly apply to as many people as a company

848
00:50:28,765 --> 00:50:32,365
Speaker 2:  like Samsung is trying to reach. But maybe I'm underestimating how many people

849
00:50:32,475 --> 00:50:33,485
Speaker 2:  want that thing

850
00:50:33,745 --> 00:50:37,365
Speaker 8:  So. what I will say, and I think a lot of our readers who have Aura rings

851
00:50:37,365 --> 00:50:40,765
Speaker 8:  will kind of back me up is that it's not a good primary tracker is a very

852
00:50:40,765 --> 00:50:44,525
Speaker 8:  good secondary tracker. Okay. But having a very good secondary tracker

853
00:50:44,645 --> 00:50:46,805
Speaker 8:  necessitates that you have a primary checker,

854
00:50:46,965 --> 00:50:50,525
Speaker 2:  Right? You've already like we're way down the funnel of people who care about

855
00:50:50,525 --> 00:50:51,445
Speaker 2:  this stuff at that point.

856
00:50:51,445 --> 00:50:55,245
Speaker 8:  Yeah. but it is a thing where it's like if I care about sleep tracking, which

857
00:50:55,245 --> 00:50:58,925
Speaker 8:  an increasing number of people do, and especially if you're an athlete and

858
00:50:58,925 --> 00:51:02,285
Speaker 8:  you care about recovery tracking fair. Yeah. Like this is a very small subset

859
00:51:02,425 --> 00:51:06,365
Speaker 8:  of people, but it is a very passionate subsect of people. Right. Then

860
00:51:06,405 --> 00:51:10,325
Speaker 8:  a ring that is something that you can have on all the time is not like

861
00:51:10,715 --> 00:51:14,565
Speaker 8:  held to the same battery constraints as a smartwatch. Then

862
00:51:14,625 --> 00:51:18,565
Speaker 8:  it kind of becomes like a, a nice secondary and like I know I'm crazy

863
00:51:18,565 --> 00:51:21,485
Speaker 8:  because I have four wearables on right now. No, I think you're

864
00:51:21,485 --> 00:51:22,605
Speaker 2:  The average user. Yeah.

865
00:51:22,795 --> 00:51:26,645
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I'm, I'm totally the average user. But basically, you know, I will

866
00:51:26,705 --> 00:51:30,565
Speaker 8:  say that I, I definitely am like, oh yeah, if I have an Aura ring

867
00:51:30,945 --> 00:51:34,725
Speaker 8:  and an Apple watch that is the perfect health tracking kind of

868
00:51:34,725 --> 00:51:38,525
Speaker 8:  combo. But you have to care about health tracking. Which I think the thing

869
00:51:38,525 --> 00:51:41,845
Speaker 8:  that makes wearables the like this subset of is the hardest

870
00:51:42,305 --> 00:51:46,045
Speaker 8:  is that fitness and health is a very, very hard habit

871
00:51:46,225 --> 00:51:47,445
Speaker 8:  to develop. Like

872
00:51:47,515 --> 00:51:49,925
Speaker 2:  Well and this is kind of where I've landed with smartwatches, right? I think

873
00:51:50,155 --> 00:51:54,045
Speaker 2:  it's definitely true that the most useful thing the

874
00:51:54,045 --> 00:51:57,765
Speaker 2:  Apple Watch does for the most people is the health and fitness stuff. I totally

875
00:51:57,785 --> 00:52:01,645
Speaker 2:  buy that. I still think that's only one slice of the

876
00:52:01,645 --> 00:52:05,365
Speaker 2:  pie of like reasons to buy an Apple watch. And there are lots of them and

877
00:52:05,365 --> 00:52:09,285
Speaker 2:  right, and I think Apple used to think the like get notifications on

878
00:52:09,285 --> 00:52:11,885
Speaker 2:  your wrist slice was the biggest, it's not the health and fitness one is

879
00:52:11,885 --> 00:52:14,685
Speaker 2:  clearly the biggest, but it's still, I'm, I mean I'm making up the numbers,

880
00:52:14,745 --> 00:52:18,325
Speaker 2:  but like that's 40% of the thing that leaves 50 other things

881
00:52:18,565 --> 00:52:22,525
Speaker 2:  that comprise the other 60%. And as we get to these other things, we're just

882
00:52:22,525 --> 00:52:25,765
Speaker 2:  pulling all of that away and So, what I keep trying to figure out is like,

883
00:52:26,385 --> 00:52:29,965
Speaker 2:  is Samsung gonna try and figure out how to put like a

884
00:52:30,415 --> 00:52:34,405
Speaker 2:  microphone and speaker into the galaxy ring too

885
00:52:34,465 --> 00:52:38,365
Speaker 2:  so that I can talk to my assistant through it? Or are we just gonna get

886
00:52:38,365 --> 00:52:42,245
Speaker 2:  to the point where this stuff matters enough to enough people that it's a

887
00:52:42,245 --> 00:52:42,725
Speaker 2:  real business?

888
00:52:43,125 --> 00:52:47,045
Speaker 8:  I think it's gonna be probably the latter just because you know,

889
00:52:47,045 --> 00:52:50,685
Speaker 8:  my grandpa, my family's full of doctors and my grandpa was like Mr. Doctor

890
00:52:50,945 --> 00:52:54,405
Speaker 8:  in our family, he was the most esteemed one and he would always tell us

891
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:58,205
Speaker 8:  that your health is the most valuable thing you have. Sure. If, you don't

892
00:52:58,205 --> 00:53:01,885
Speaker 8:  have health your life kind of is, it's not what it could be. It's one of

893
00:53:01,885 --> 00:53:05,565
Speaker 8:  those things that I think the longer that we live, the more technology advances,

894
00:53:05,565 --> 00:53:08,965
Speaker 8:  the more that we know about our health, like I think that's going to kind

895
00:53:08,965 --> 00:53:12,485
Speaker 8:  of impress upon people that I wanna live longer, I wanna see my kids, I wanna

896
00:53:12,485 --> 00:53:16,045
Speaker 8:  be able to, you know, do things with them that's gonna become more important

897
00:53:16,065 --> 00:53:19,685
Speaker 8:  to people. And the thing that really stymie is that, is that

898
00:53:19,945 --> 00:53:23,725
Speaker 8:  health is not built in spurts. It's not in New Year's resolutions,

899
00:53:23,725 --> 00:53:27,365
Speaker 8:  it's in tiny things that you do every day. And that's very, very, very difficult

900
00:53:27,365 --> 00:53:30,045
Speaker 8:  for most people to make that behavioral change. For sure. It's for sure the

901
00:53:30,045 --> 00:53:32,925
Speaker 8:  number one thing that I think stands in the way of wearable adoption and

902
00:53:32,925 --> 00:53:36,885
Speaker 8:  battery life, those two things. So you know, it's

903
00:53:36,885 --> 00:53:40,525
Speaker 8:  just, I really do think the health aspect is big there, but don don't think

904
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:44,565
Speaker 8:  that Samsung would be smart to put microphones into the Galaxy ring.

905
00:53:44,845 --> 00:53:48,365
Speaker 8:  I really don't. I think the smartest thing it could do is to bundle it with

906
00:53:48,365 --> 00:53:52,205
Speaker 8:  the Galaxy Watch so that you're not buying it separately, you're

907
00:53:52,205 --> 00:53:55,405
Speaker 8:  buying it for a discounted price. Interesting. And then you have the whole

908
00:53:55,405 --> 00:53:58,885
Speaker 8:  picture of, of the Samsung Health experience and then

909
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:02,685
Speaker 8:  you're just in their ecosystem. I really think it's an ecosystem pay

910
00:54:02,715 --> 00:54:06,565
Speaker 8:  play where you get an accessory for your accessory to your phone. And I think

911
00:54:06,565 --> 00:54:09,965
Speaker 8:  if they're smart they'll do it that way. Where you're just like, oh are you

912
00:54:09,965 --> 00:54:13,765
Speaker 8:  gonna upgrade to the Samsung Galaxy seven free galaxy ring for you? Right.

913
00:54:14,025 --> 00:54:17,525
Speaker 8:  And then you know, you do that at first and then people get on different

914
00:54:17,525 --> 00:54:21,045
Speaker 8:  upgrade cycles and then they buy in and that's my

915
00:54:21,045 --> 00:54:23,445
Speaker 8:  insidious capitalism plan for

916
00:54:24,105 --> 00:54:27,365
Speaker 2:  It tracks. No, it does. It does kind of make sense. And it also gets you

917
00:54:27,365 --> 00:54:31,245
Speaker 2:  to the point where now you're literally wearing something from that company

918
00:54:31,585 --> 00:54:32,765
Speaker 2:  24 hours a day

919
00:54:32,985 --> 00:54:36,525
Speaker 8:  And I think it, it should be really scary for Aura or Unprompted

920
00:54:36,715 --> 00:54:39,845
Speaker 8:  sent me a statement when the Galaxy ring was unveils. They're like, oh that's

921
00:54:39,845 --> 00:54:40,165
Speaker 8:  never a good time.

922
00:54:40,165 --> 00:54:42,325
Speaker 2:  They're like, did it say we're not scared? Yes, everything's fine. Yes.

923
00:54:42,675 --> 00:54:46,605
Speaker 8:  They said we're not scared, we have hundreds of patents. We are the

924
00:54:46,605 --> 00:54:50,485
Speaker 8:  leader. This is validation in the space. And I'm like, yes, but also you

925
00:54:50,485 --> 00:54:53,645
Speaker 8:  should be scared because you charge a $6 monthly

926
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:57,925
Speaker 8:  subscription on top of a $300 ring. Samsung can go,

927
00:54:57,965 --> 00:55:00,205
Speaker 8:  oh we don't need a, we don't need a subscription for you. Right.

928
00:55:00,205 --> 00:55:01,845
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Here have some rings we don't need have some

929
00:55:01,845 --> 00:55:05,045
Speaker 8:  Rings have it with our, with our watch. That also doesn't come with rings.

930
00:55:05,255 --> 00:55:09,045
Speaker 8:  We've also spent two years beefing up our sleep tracking like features.

931
00:55:09,385 --> 00:55:13,365
Speaker 8:  So Yeah. Yeah. So I think, I think auras, I don't

932
00:55:13,365 --> 00:55:17,005
Speaker 8:  think they have to worry now, but they should be a little

933
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:19,045
Speaker 8:  concerned is what what I think. Yeah.

934
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:22,765
Speaker 2:  Yeah that seems right. It has a lot of the vibes of like when

935
00:55:22,775 --> 00:55:26,365
Speaker 2:  Slack took out that full page ad when Microsoft Teams came out being like,

936
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:29,285
Speaker 2:  everything's fine. We think our product is terrific and that went super great

937
00:55:29,285 --> 00:55:32,965
Speaker 2:  for Slack. Last thing then we gotta go. Should I just give up on my idea

938
00:55:33,225 --> 00:55:37,205
Speaker 2:  and dream of the like wearable computer as a

939
00:55:37,205 --> 00:55:41,005
Speaker 2:  thing? Like ever since the beginning of the Apple Watch, I have loved

940
00:55:41,545 --> 00:55:45,165
Speaker 2:  the thesis of the Apple Watch originally, which was basically like,

941
00:55:45,385 --> 00:55:49,205
Speaker 2:  we wanna build a new, simpler, lower touch, more

942
00:55:49,485 --> 00:55:53,405
Speaker 2:  personal device for you to use instead of pulling out your phone

943
00:55:53,465 --> 00:55:56,885
Speaker 2:  all the time. And I think like if I were to get real Galaxy branded about

944
00:55:56,885 --> 00:55:59,925
Speaker 2:  all of this, right? It's like you, you come back to all this AI stuff that's

945
00:55:59,925 --> 00:56:02,725
Speaker 2:  happening and the stuff we're doing with voice and with transcription and

946
00:56:02,905 --> 00:56:05,565
Speaker 2:  you can get to the point where like, okay, maybe actually talking to my wrist

947
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:09,845
Speaker 2:  is going to quickly become a thing I can do and it will be good. And at

948
00:56:09,845 --> 00:56:13,405
Speaker 2:  the same time all of these products are running away from that stuff and

949
00:56:13,425 --> 00:56:17,285
Speaker 2:  toward health and fitness. And so one of two things is either gonna happen,

950
00:56:17,315 --> 00:56:20,965
Speaker 2:  it's either gonna come back around or it's just these are just going to be

951
00:56:20,965 --> 00:56:23,500
Speaker 2:  health and fitness devices and we're either gonna have to invent something

952
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:27,125
Speaker 2:  new or the phone is gonna continue to be the computer. Which one do you think

953
00:56:27,125 --> 00:56:27,365
Speaker 2:  it's,

954
00:56:27,725 --> 00:56:31,245
Speaker 8:  I think in the short term the latter, but in the long term the former.

955
00:56:31,385 --> 00:56:32,325
Speaker 2:  So you think we might come back around?

956
00:56:32,605 --> 00:56:34,725
Speaker 8:  Actually I, I think we are gonna come back around and you can see it with

957
00:56:34,745 --> 00:56:38,045
Speaker 8:  AR glasses. They are real, I just don't necessarily think it's gonna be a

958
00:56:38,045 --> 00:56:41,525
Speaker 8:  wrist. I think it's gonna be your eyes. That's, yeah. So like it's just,

959
00:56:41,845 --> 00:56:43,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah those Arabia meta glasses are like

960
00:56:43,665 --> 00:56:44,645
Speaker 8:  That's, it's pretty wild.

961
00:56:44,705 --> 00:56:46,445
Speaker 2:  You put them on and it's like, oh I kind of get it now.

962
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:50,045
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Yeah. Like I, I get it. Yeah. Once they figure out how to do actual

963
00:56:50,185 --> 00:56:53,965
Speaker 8:  AR and not mixed reality, that's gonna be, it's, it's gonna be a lot. But

964
00:56:53,965 --> 00:56:56,365
Speaker 8:  the thing is, is point when you wear something on your body that's health,

965
00:56:56,495 --> 00:57:00,285
Speaker 8:  right? That requires the FDA to get involved. Like we've been talking about

966
00:57:00,285 --> 00:57:04,205
Speaker 8:  smart contacts for a long time, there's various prototypes in that. But when

967
00:57:04,205 --> 00:57:07,765
Speaker 8:  you are shining light into your eye that way, that's a

968
00:57:08,265 --> 00:57:10,725
Speaker 8:  are you gonna burn your ol It's the whole thing. Yeah. We don know, right?

969
00:57:10,825 --> 00:57:14,605
Speaker 8:  We don't know. That's why, that's my theory is that why in the last versions

970
00:57:14,605 --> 00:57:18,365
Speaker 8:  of iOS and Watch West, they included vision health for children

971
00:57:18,395 --> 00:57:22,325
Speaker 8:  because children's vision health If, you mess up your health as a

972
00:57:22,325 --> 00:57:24,405
Speaker 8:  child. You can't really get into a vision pro can you

973
00:57:24,705 --> 00:57:27,965
Speaker 2:  Man, speaking of ruthless capitalism, like we're gonna, we're gonna save

974
00:57:28,165 --> 00:57:30,285
Speaker 2:  children's eyesight so they can use our headsets.

975
00:57:30,685 --> 00:57:33,925
Speaker 8:  I do, but actually I really, you probably right. Do think that's it. I really

976
00:57:33,925 --> 00:57:37,285
Speaker 8:  do think that's part of the thing because you know, smart glasses leave out

977
00:57:37,485 --> 00:57:40,725
Speaker 8:  a lot of people who don't have like, you know, normal vision

978
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:44,605
Speaker 8:  including myself with my terrible astigmatism. But

979
00:57:45,125 --> 00:57:48,245
Speaker 8:  I really do think that we're gonna go all the way around. It's just that

980
00:57:48,495 --> 00:57:51,885
Speaker 8:  we're in the very baby ages of wearables. It might feel like we've gotten

981
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:55,285
Speaker 8:  really advanced, but we are super early on it. The tech is not there yet.

982
00:57:55,525 --> 00:57:59,325
Speaker 8:  It's not miniature enough yet as we saw with the Vision Pro, it's here to

983
00:57:59,325 --> 00:58:03,205
Speaker 8:  sell you on a future and that's what smartwatches are here. The RayBan meta

984
00:58:03,205 --> 00:58:06,165
Speaker 8:  glasses, that's what they're here. Like the ora ring. These are all selling

985
00:58:06,165 --> 00:58:08,965
Speaker 8:  you on a future that hasn't arrived yet. 'cause technologically it's not

986
00:58:09,325 --> 00:58:13,205
Speaker 8:  possible yet. And like are we going to get noninvasive blood glucose monitoring

987
00:58:13,395 --> 00:58:16,565
Speaker 8:  someday? But they've been working on it since 1975.

988
00:58:17,075 --> 00:58:17,365
Speaker 2:  Like

989
00:58:17,645 --> 00:58:21,205
Speaker 8:  I should do not. Yeah, they've been working on it since 1975. It's gonna

990
00:58:21,205 --> 00:58:24,765
Speaker 8:  take a long time. There's a lot of advances that have happened in the background

991
00:58:24,785 --> 00:58:27,525
Speaker 8:  and I talk to all these vendors and it's really cool what they're doing.

992
00:58:27,675 --> 00:58:31,085
Speaker 8:  They gotta deal what the FDA clearance process and that will take anywhere

993
00:58:31,085 --> 00:58:34,645
Speaker 8:  between two to four years depending on how much money and testing capabilities

994
00:58:34,645 --> 00:58:37,365
Speaker 8:  they have and the mountain of paperwork that they wanna do. They have to

995
00:58:37,365 --> 00:58:40,445
Speaker 8:  do it in a medical facility, they have to have the, the security protocols

996
00:58:40,445 --> 00:58:44,085
Speaker 8:  in place. It's, it's a lot of work. So yeah,

997
00:58:44,545 --> 00:58:48,085
Speaker 8:  now wellness, future health, that's kind of the trade off that they're making.

998
00:58:48,235 --> 00:58:48,885
Speaker 8:  Okay. And then

999
00:58:48,885 --> 00:58:51,205
Speaker 2:  Long future David gets his risk computer

1000
00:58:51,595 --> 00:58:55,405
Speaker 8:  Long future David gets his face computer, his wrist

1001
00:58:55,765 --> 00:58:59,685
Speaker 8:  computer, his finger computer every on the computer. You will be a computer.

1002

1011
01:00:33,665 --> 01:00:37,105
Speaker 2:  you this week we have a question about the Vision Pro. If you're tired of

1012
01:00:37,105 --> 01:00:39,825
Speaker 2:  hearing about the Vision Pro and Apple and headsets and the whole thing,

1013
01:00:40,045 --> 01:00:43,265
Speaker 2:  I'm really sorry, but it's what everyone keeps asking about. This question

1014
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:44,105
Speaker 2:  comes from John.

1015
01:00:45,235 --> 01:00:48,865
Speaker 11:  Hello Vergecast team. I'm John in West Lafayette, Indiana,

1016
01:00:49,275 --> 01:00:53,145
Speaker 11:  apple Price, the First Vision Pro at $3,500

1017
01:00:53,645 --> 01:00:57,265
Speaker 11:  for getting Apple's, high profit margins for the moment. What would the

1018
01:00:57,265 --> 01:01:01,185
Speaker 11:  price need to be for your review to say we don't

1019
01:01:01,185 --> 01:01:04,585
Speaker 11:  yet know how much consumers will use this, but the price is attractive.

1020
01:01:04,975 --> 01:01:08,905
Speaker 11:  $1,500, $2,000. Optional follow up question

1021
01:01:09,115 --> 01:01:12,825
Speaker 11:  today, apple sells iPad models from 3 29 to

1022
01:01:13,165 --> 01:01:16,945
Speaker 11:  10 99. In two or three years, what will be the right

1023
01:01:16,995 --> 01:01:20,745
Speaker 11:  price range for two or three Apple Vision models? Thanks

1024
01:01:20,985 --> 01:01:21,945
Speaker 11:  everyone, love the show.

1025
01:01:22,615 --> 01:01:26,225
Speaker 2:  Okay, I picked this question not because I have a crystal clear answer, but

1026
01:01:26,225 --> 01:01:29,985
Speaker 2:  largely because I really wanna know what you all think. As you've heard

1027
01:01:30,085 --> 01:01:33,985
Speaker 2:  on this show, I have spent a lot of time yelling about how expensive

1028
01:01:33,985 --> 01:01:36,585
Speaker 2:  the Vision Pro is. I think the phrase all caps

1029
01:01:36,585 --> 01:01:40,345
Speaker 2:  $3,500 is like going to be written at the top of my

1030
01:01:40,345 --> 01:01:44,105
Speaker 2:  obituary at this point. But I think this is a really interesting and complicated

1031
01:01:44,385 --> 01:01:46,745
Speaker 2:  question and I, before I give my answer, I do wanna know what you think.

1032
01:01:46,765 --> 01:01:50,745
Speaker 2:  So call 8 6 6 Verge one, one Vergecast at The Verge dot com.

1033
01:01:51,255 --> 01:01:55,105
Speaker 2:  Tell me what price feels like the tipping point where

1034
01:01:55,105 --> 01:01:59,025
Speaker 2:  this goes from sort of neat thing that exists but doesn't make

1035
01:01:59,025 --> 01:02:02,985
Speaker 2:  sense for most people to thing you would consider buying for

1036
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:05,505
Speaker 2:  real and telling other people to buy and If, you already bought a Vision

1037
01:02:05,525 --> 01:02:09,185
Speaker 2:  Pro. I'm curious how much more you would pay. So think about that in both

1038
01:02:09,185 --> 01:02:13,025
Speaker 2:  directions and let me know. I have two answers. I think the consumer

1039
01:02:13,155 --> 01:02:16,985
Speaker 2:  price to make regular people buy this thing in

1040
01:02:17,095 --> 01:02:21,035
Speaker 2:  huge numbers is $999. I think we're a long way away

1041
01:02:21,035 --> 01:02:24,475
Speaker 2:  from that, but I think when you can get a thousand dollars version of this,

1042
01:02:24,785 --> 01:02:28,755
Speaker 2:  that is basically a very good iPad, it's a good entertainment device, it's

1043
01:02:28,755 --> 01:02:32,115
Speaker 2:  a thing you don't have to use all the time to feel like you've got your money's

1044
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:35,675
Speaker 2:  worth. That's a nice price for that. It's right in that high end

1045
01:02:36,025 --> 01:02:39,995
Speaker 2:  iPad range. It's what you'd pay for a really good computer monitor.

1046
01:02:40,425 --> 01:02:44,315
Speaker 2:  It's about the price of a MacBook Air. It just feels like that is kind

1047
01:02:44,315 --> 01:02:48,155
Speaker 2:  of the top line. Buy this device, it'll be cool

1048
01:02:48,155 --> 01:02:51,835
Speaker 2:  and fun, you'll love it. In my dreams, we're more in like the

1049
01:02:51,905 --> 01:02:55,835
Speaker 2:  5 99, 6 99 kind of game console price, but I think

1050
01:02:56,085 --> 01:02:59,915
Speaker 2:  Apple is Apple and at 9 99 this thing would do just as well.

1051
01:03:00,335 --> 01:03:02,755
Speaker 2:  But also at 1999,

1052
01:03:02,815 --> 01:03:06,715
Speaker 2:  $1,999. I think the Vision Pro as

1053
01:03:06,715 --> 01:03:10,035
Speaker 2:  it exists now becomes an order of magnitude more

1054
01:03:10,085 --> 01:03:13,915
Speaker 2:  compelling at that point. You're in nice MacBook Pro range

1055
01:03:14,655 --> 01:03:18,515
Speaker 2:  and it's very much still a pro device for pro people who want to use it

1056
01:03:18,575 --> 01:03:22,435
Speaker 2:  for pro things, but even still it becomes

1057
01:03:23,015 --> 01:03:26,915
Speaker 2:  hugely more palatable. I mean, think of all the people who spent $1,600 on

1058
01:03:26,995 --> 01:03:30,715
Speaker 2:  a studio display or are happy to upgrade their

1059
01:03:30,855 --> 01:03:34,475
Speaker 2:  own PC for a thousand dollars just to get a little more

1060
01:03:34,475 --> 01:03:37,435
Speaker 2:  performance and a little more memory and all that kind of stuff. Those are

1061
01:03:37,435 --> 01:03:40,995
Speaker 2:  the sorts of people who I think a $2,000 price tag feels

1062
01:03:41,325 --> 01:03:45,235
Speaker 2:  right. This is a great television like you, you could honestly at $2,000

1063
01:03:45,415 --> 01:03:49,315
Speaker 2:  say this is the best tv, it's cool to wear, you'll love it, but it's a

1064
01:03:49,315 --> 01:03:52,875
Speaker 2:  television and it'll still be compelling to a lot of people at $2,000,

1065
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:56,755
Speaker 2:  $3,500. You're just out of that range, at least for me. And I would

1066
01:03:56,755 --> 01:04:00,515
Speaker 2:  guess that long term, based on what I've seen so far and the way people are

1067
01:04:00,515 --> 01:04:03,675
Speaker 2:  talking about it and the way even Apple talks about the Vision Pro, I think

1068
01:04:03,905 --> 01:04:07,835
Speaker 2:  this thing will end up covering that gamut. I think this lands kind

1069
01:04:07,835 --> 01:04:11,795
Speaker 2:  of in MacBook Range where you can spend a thousand dollars for

1070
01:04:11,795 --> 01:04:15,275
Speaker 2:  the cheapest one and I think the cheapest one ends up basically just being

1071
01:04:15,635 --> 01:04:19,595
Speaker 2:  a screen with apps. It's an iPad on your face in a very real way. And I

1072
01:04:19,595 --> 01:04:22,515
Speaker 2:  think for a thousand dollars that's gonna be compelling to a lot of people

1073
01:04:22,865 --> 01:04:26,395
Speaker 2:  over and over. The thing that I'm hearing is that people like this most as

1074
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:29,835
Speaker 2:  an entertainment device, it's a way to sit on the couch or lie in bed and

1075
01:04:29,835 --> 01:04:33,475
Speaker 2:  watch something. That's what people buy an iPad for. And I think

1076
01:04:33,815 --> 01:04:37,635
Speaker 2:  you can get to a point where if you're Apple and you can sell basically

1077
01:04:37,695 --> 01:04:41,555
Speaker 2:  an iPad, but it's cooler to use, you don't have to

1078
01:04:41,555 --> 01:04:45,035
Speaker 2:  hold it in your hands, which is actually valuable for a lot of things and

1079
01:04:45,035 --> 01:04:48,955
Speaker 2:  it has all this kind of gaming and productivity upside, I think you can sell

1080
01:04:48,955 --> 01:04:52,275
Speaker 2:  the base thing for a thousand dollars and then for more stuff, more power,

1081
01:04:52,345 --> 01:04:56,115
Speaker 2:  more productivity tools, more ability to like do cool

1082
01:04:56,115 --> 01:04:59,275
Speaker 2:  stuff, I don't know what they would add into these other things other than

1083
01:04:59,305 --> 01:05:03,275
Speaker 2:  just better specs. That's how you get up to two grand. So that's my theory

1084
01:05:03,335 --> 01:05:07,115
Speaker 2:  is that this thing wants to land basically on the whole spectrum between

1085
01:05:07,175 --> 01:05:10,795
Speaker 2:  one and $2,000 and when it gets there, that becomes pretty

1086
01:05:11,235 --> 01:05:13,875
Speaker 2:  powerful. I think it's gonna take a while to get there. I don't think Apple

1087
01:05:13,935 --> 01:05:17,580
Speaker 2:  is charging $3,500 for this because it is like a a massively

1088
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:21,325
Speaker 2:  greedy company. I think this is a very, very, very, very expensive thing

1089
01:05:21,325 --> 01:05:24,765
Speaker 2:  to make and it's gonna take a long time before they can sell it to you for

1090
01:05:24,905 --> 01:05:28,845
Speaker 2:  one or even $2,000. But when they do, I will stop yelling about

1091
01:05:28,845 --> 01:05:32,045
Speaker 2:  how expensive it is and I'm very much looking forward to that day. But again,
