2
00:01:11,275 --> 00:01:14,985
Speaker 7:  Hello And Welcome to To Vergecast, the flagship podcast of perceiving the

3
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:17,745
Speaker 7:  World through screens. Oh yeah,

4
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:18,625
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That,

5
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:19,905
Speaker 7:  That's the thing I told you about.

6
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:21,225
Speaker 5:  It's accurate

7
00:01:21,655 --> 00:01:23,185
Speaker 7:  That no one believed me about.

8
00:01:23,605 --> 00:01:27,185
Speaker 8:  So does that mean our podcast is like very good at first and then sort of

9
00:01:27,185 --> 00:01:29,305
Speaker 8:  slowly gets more annoying over time? Yeah,

10
00:01:29,485 --> 00:01:29,705
Speaker 7:  You

11
00:01:29,945 --> 00:01:30,305
Speaker 5:  Fluctuate, you

12
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:32,145
Speaker 7:  It's magic until it's not. It's To

13
00:01:32,305 --> 00:01:32,545
Speaker 5:  Vergecast.

14
00:01:34,885 --> 00:01:38,865
Speaker 7:  That's very good. Quite a lot going on this week. Yeah. As we're

15
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:42,625
Speaker 7:  recording, we are expecting breaking news from Microsoft about The future

16
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:43,265
Speaker 7:  of the Xbox.

17
00:01:43,485 --> 00:01:44,265
Speaker 8:  Yes. Yes.

18
00:01:44,645 --> 00:01:48,625
Speaker 7:  So we're just gonna react to that in real time and then we'll have Tom Warren

19
00:01:48,655 --> 00:01:52,495
Speaker 7:  come on the next show to explain what's going on. But we'll react to

20
00:01:52,575 --> 00:01:54,895
Speaker 7:  that in real time. I promise you. I'm your friend Neil. I, David. Pierce

21
00:01:54,895 --> 00:01:55,655
Speaker 7:  is here. Hi.

22
00:01:55,975 --> 00:01:59,855
Speaker 8:  I should warn everyone that I have a deeply sore

23
00:01:59,855 --> 00:02:03,695
Speaker 8:  throat. So the like sexy smoldering thing I'm doing is just a

24
00:02:03,755 --> 00:02:07,295
Speaker 8:  one time thing and it will not be this good to listen to me every time.

25
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,935
Speaker 7:  No, you should keep it. We're gonna, we're gonna do an AI that we're gonna

26
00:02:11,055 --> 00:02:14,695
Speaker 7:  do a sexy smolder ai. I love this. OpenAI dot com slash sexy smolder

27
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:17,255
Speaker 7:  Alex Cranz is here.

28
00:02:17,315 --> 00:02:20,415
Speaker 5:  Deeply disappointed. I don't also have a cold right now. You can

29
00:02:20,415 --> 00:02:20,895
Speaker 7:  Vague big.

30
00:02:20,895 --> 00:02:24,095
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I, I could, I could drop it a little lower. I don't even know how far

31
00:02:24,095 --> 00:02:24,775
Speaker 5:  to go. This

32
00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:28,695
Speaker 7:  Is when, when we first started podcasting with the in Graduate podcast ages

33
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:32,695
Speaker 7:  ago, I was like, I should have a podcast voice. Yeah. But gave up on

34
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:33,215
Speaker 7:  that immediately.

35
00:02:33,515 --> 00:02:36,615
Speaker 5:  You have to, otherwise you forget about it and then you're like, oh, how

36
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,655
Speaker 5:  are you? This is my normal voice. And people are like, Jesus,

37
00:02:38,755 --> 00:02:39,815
Speaker 7:  You went with Mickey Mouse.

38
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:43,575
Speaker 5:  That's my normal voice. You don't, I I actually do a Verge voice

39
00:02:44,395 --> 00:02:46,535
Speaker 5:  at home. I talk like this all the time. Oh

40
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:46,775
Speaker 7:  My God.

41
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:50,295
Speaker 8:  Can you do an impression of your podcast voice for us? Just real fast.

42
00:02:51,015 --> 00:02:53,255
Speaker 7:  I think decoder is my fake podcast voice. Oh,

43
00:02:53,495 --> 00:02:53,655
Speaker 5:  Interesting.

44
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:56,495
Speaker 7:  Oh, it's, it's a pseudo NPRI

45
00:02:56,495 --> 00:03:00,405
Speaker 8:  Think of that as like NELI Patel in his study swirling a brandy.

46
00:03:00,405 --> 00:03:02,805
Speaker 8:  Yeah. That's about Eli Decoder. That's

47
00:03:02,805 --> 00:03:04,645
Speaker 7:  The same. Yeah, that's the same voice. That's

48
00:03:04,645 --> 00:03:05,245
Speaker 8:  Right. That makes sense.

49
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:09,165
Speaker 7:  Okay. It's drunk Ira Glass. That's the decoder voice. That's what I

50
00:03:09,165 --> 00:03:09,605
Speaker 7:  got for you.

51
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:11,485
Speaker 8:  Okay. I love this for you.

52
00:03:12,085 --> 00:03:14,445
Speaker 7:  We gotta start with some housekeeping. This is our first

53
00:03:15,645 --> 00:03:19,045
Speaker 7:  Vergecast back on the main Verge YouTube channel.

54
00:03:19,725 --> 00:03:23,445
Speaker 7:  I, I am told this is a complicated move, but it should be simple to

55
00:03:23,445 --> 00:03:25,885
Speaker 7:  experience. David, can you explain what's going on?

56
00:03:26,265 --> 00:03:30,245
Speaker 8:  Yes. Okay. So there are now two channels on which you can

57
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:33,285
Speaker 8:  experience The Vergecast. We have The Verge main YouTube channel, which is

58
00:03:33,285 --> 00:03:36,885
Speaker 8:  youtube.com/ The Verge or search for The Verge. That's where all the

59
00:03:37,035 --> 00:03:40,765
Speaker 8:  full episodes are gonna live. We just wanted to

60
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,725
Speaker 8:  have the show and the rest of our stuff kind of be closer to each other,

61
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:47,565
Speaker 8:  easier to find. And with all the stuff YouTube is doing with

62
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:51,005
Speaker 8:  podcasts right now, it actually makes sense to have those things a little

63
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:54,405
Speaker 8:  closer together because now you can subscribe to just a single playlist.

64
00:03:54,465 --> 00:03:57,845
Speaker 8:  If all you want is the podcast, you can subscribe to the channel and get

65
00:03:57,845 --> 00:04:01,125
Speaker 8:  everything in YouTube and get the podcast and YouTube music. It's all a little

66
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:05,085
Speaker 8:  weird right now because Google is still sorting out how all of

67
00:04:05,105 --> 00:04:06,325
Speaker 8:  the podcast stuff works.

68
00:04:06,595 --> 00:04:09,485
Speaker 7:  It's very in character for Google. I just wanna be clear about that. Yeah.

69
00:04:09,485 --> 00:04:12,205
Speaker 8:  So like all of this is stuff that I think we are doing

70
00:04:13,235 --> 00:04:17,085
Speaker 8:  correctly and just slightly ahead of Google. So hopefully this

71
00:04:17,085 --> 00:04:20,725
Speaker 8:  will continue to make more sense as time goes on. But basically all the full

72
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:23,525
Speaker 8:  episodes are gonna be on the Verges YouTube channel from now on. And then

73
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:27,205
Speaker 8:  we're gonna do like clips and extras and silly stuff where we make fun of

74
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:30,725
Speaker 8:  NELI off the show on The Vergecast channel. Good. So that's where all that

75
00:04:30,725 --> 00:04:34,645
Speaker 8:  stuff will live. I promise there

76
00:04:34,645 --> 00:04:38,565
Speaker 8:  was a lot of weirdness as we moved all of this stuff. Liam, our

77
00:04:38,765 --> 00:04:41,925
Speaker 8:  producer, did like a heroic job to get all of this done.

78
00:04:43,105 --> 00:04:46,205
Speaker 8:  It was messy because YouTube is messy, but I think it's done now. People

79
00:04:46,205 --> 00:04:50,125
Speaker 8:  seem to have like found The Vergecast again in all the YouTube platforms.

80
00:04:50,785 --> 00:04:53,765
Speaker 8:  So it should work. And If, you don't listen to this podcast on YouTube. Don't

81
00:04:53,765 --> 00:04:55,525
Speaker 8:  worry about it. Literally nothing else will change.

82
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:59,645
Speaker 7:  I hope this makes more sense as time goes on. Should be Google's motto. I

83
00:04:59,645 --> 00:05:02,565
Speaker 7:  just wanna be a hundred percent clear on that.

84
00:05:03,665 --> 00:05:06,885
Speaker 8:  We have a product team focused on making this make sense. Yeah.

85
00:05:08,805 --> 00:05:12,685
Speaker 7:  I hope this makes sense as time goes on, is how

86
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:16,125
Speaker 7:  Google approaches product strategy at a very high level.

87
00:05:18,035 --> 00:05:21,925
Speaker 7:  I'll give you one, but one example, and I don't know why this

88
00:05:22,035 --> 00:05:25,765
Speaker 7:  Threads post did the numbers It did, except I think it spoke to people's

89
00:05:25,955 --> 00:05:29,605
Speaker 7:  very souls. I bought a big silly

90
00:05:29,755 --> 00:05:33,365
Speaker 7:  Sony tv. I'm very happy with it. Yeah, it's a 95 0 1 Ooh.

91
00:05:33,635 --> 00:05:37,405
Speaker 7:  Very, very pleased with this televis. It looks amazing. It came with a webcam,

92
00:05:38,535 --> 00:05:42,205
Speaker 7:  which I think is just representative of how deeply overcharged I was for

93
00:05:42,205 --> 00:05:45,485
Speaker 7:  this tv. Yeah. They were like, it's, we made so much money. Here's a camera

94
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:49,925
Speaker 7:  fine. So I'm like, what can this webcam do? No, nothing.

95
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:54,085
Speaker 7:  They can watch you while you watch TV and adjust the settings. Oh,

96
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:58,045
Speaker 7:  that's a hard no. Yeah. And then it it, there's a Zoom client

97
00:05:58,505 --> 00:06:01,485
Speaker 7:  and there's a Google Meet client. So I was like, fine.

98
00:06:02,465 --> 00:06:06,165
Speaker 7:  Oh, it has gesture controls, which are after the vision Pros fake. I'm just

99
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:07,685
Speaker 7:  not doing gesture controls. I

100
00:06:07,685 --> 00:06:10,445
Speaker 8:  Know what happened. Oh my God. This is the best. If this goes where, I think

101
00:06:10,445 --> 00:06:12,125
Speaker 8:  this is about to go. This is my favorite thing.

102
00:06:12,285 --> 00:06:15,965
Speaker 7:  I I clip the camera to the top of the tv. Yeah. And I launched Google

103
00:06:16,035 --> 00:06:19,955
Speaker 7:  Meet to sign into our staff meeting and basically

104
00:06:19,975 --> 00:06:23,875
Speaker 7:  be a brat at our staff meeting. And I'm like, where do I type in the code

105
00:06:25,165 --> 00:06:28,865
Speaker 7:  and you can't. And I was like, okay, where do I

106
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:32,585
Speaker 7:  switch accounts to my work account? And you can't.

107
00:06:33,005 --> 00:06:36,865
Speaker 7:  Oh. And so they've made a Google Meet client for Android,

108
00:06:37,555 --> 00:06:38,865
Speaker 7:  which this television runs.

109
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:42,155
Speaker 7:  They can't join meetings.

110
00:06:44,175 --> 00:06:44,395
Speaker 5:  But

111
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:49,355
Speaker 7:  It can, it can just call, you can just call people with your phone number

112
00:06:49,745 --> 00:06:52,155
Speaker 7:  from your television. A thing that everyone wants to do.

113
00:06:53,585 --> 00:06:54,315
Speaker 5:  Yeah. No

114
00:06:54,445 --> 00:06:57,715
Speaker 7:  David, I'm curious for your guess on what happened here because I think I

115
00:06:57,715 --> 00:06:58,475
Speaker 7:  know. So

116
00:06:58,475 --> 00:07:02,315
Speaker 8:  What happened was Google, in its infinite wisdom

117
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,715
Speaker 8:  decided that Duo and Meet should not be different things. Because when you

118
00:07:06,715 --> 00:07:10,475
Speaker 8:  call one person and you call another person, it should be the same

119
00:07:10,475 --> 00:07:13,835
Speaker 8:  thing. So what they did was they renamed

120
00:07:14,775 --> 00:07:18,085
Speaker 8:  Duo to meet and then renamed

121
00:07:18,595 --> 00:07:21,485
Speaker 8:  Meet to Meet original. And then

122
00:07:22,565 --> 00:07:26,045
Speaker 8:  I think I have this right. And then the old duo now meet

123
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:30,085
Speaker 8:  became Google Meet. But I'm guessing what never happened is that your

124
00:07:30,305 --> 00:07:34,285
Speaker 8:  TV never got an update. So you still have Google Duo with a different

125
00:07:34,285 --> 00:07:34,525
Speaker 8:  name.

126
00:07:34,835 --> 00:07:38,165
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It, it didn't get an up. There's no update, a avail. It's not my TV

127
00:07:38,165 --> 00:07:41,965
Speaker 7:  didn't get an update. My TV is hardwired to the router. This is a very insane

128
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:43,325
Speaker 7:  TV situation. Well,

129
00:07:43,325 --> 00:07:45,365
Speaker 8:  Okay, you're right. Google forgot that this TV exists,

130
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:49,205
Speaker 7:  Exists. Google forgot to update the me client so

131
00:07:49,325 --> 00:07:50,725
Speaker 7:  that it could join meetings.

132
00:07:50,895 --> 00:07:53,445
Speaker 8:  Right. It changed the name but forgot to change

133
00:07:53,745 --> 00:07:56,965
Speaker 7:  The app. There's a, there's a Kanban board in Mountain View

134
00:07:57,275 --> 00:08:00,445
Speaker 7:  labeled, we hope this makes sense over time

135
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:05,565
Speaker 7:  and update the meet clients so it can join meetings as a card

136
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:06,245
Speaker 7:  on that board

137
00:08:07,505 --> 00:08:07,725
Speaker 5:  Far.

138
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:10,165
Speaker 7:  It just hasn't moved in over a year.

139
00:08:10,595 --> 00:08:14,245
Speaker 8:  NELI, I have to tell you, they, they scrum this and they didn't. They

140
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:16,685
Speaker 8:  decided that updating Eli's TV was not a corporate

141
00:08:16,925 --> 00:08:18,285
Speaker 7:  Priority. It's an Android app.

142
00:08:18,435 --> 00:08:20,245
Speaker 8:  Your TV was a zero rate phenomen,

143
00:08:20,245 --> 00:08:24,045
Speaker 7:  Like TV's just a giant tablet. You don't even remember when they were like,

144
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,965
Speaker 7:  Android tablets are back. We're gonna try hard again.

145
00:08:29,365 --> 00:08:29,525
Speaker 7:  Remember that.

146
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,805
Speaker 5:  It'll make sense over time. Don't worry about

147
00:08:31,805 --> 00:08:34,245
Speaker 7:  It. It makes, we hope this makes sense over time.

148
00:08:34,525 --> 00:08:35,925
Speaker 5:  Don't worry about it. Come

149
00:08:36,425 --> 00:08:40,365
Speaker 7:  Anyway. I I had to audio only join this staff meeting. It's like I was

150
00:08:40,365 --> 00:08:42,845
Speaker 7:  like, I don't even, I can't join from my phone here.

151
00:08:43,325 --> 00:08:44,445
Speaker 5:  I had all the power. It

152
00:08:44,445 --> 00:08:48,165
Speaker 7:  Was great. It was great. Truly. Alright,

153
00:08:49,105 --> 00:08:52,285
Speaker 7:  so we're, we're on YouTube. The upshot of that is one I can't join meetings

154
00:08:52,285 --> 00:08:55,965
Speaker 7:  for my television and two, we are now available on the main YouTube channel.

155
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:57,525
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Is that about right? That's right.

156
00:08:57,525 --> 00:08:57,805
Speaker 8:  Pretty

157
00:08:57,805 --> 00:09:00,485
Speaker 7:  Much. Alright, let's talk about the news. There's quite a bit of news. Let's

158
00:09:00,485 --> 00:09:03,845
Speaker 7:  start with the Vision Pro. It is two weeks after the Vision Pro hit,

159
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,525
Speaker 5:  Which means everybody has to return it. Now

160
00:09:06,585 --> 00:09:10,525
Speaker 7:  You gotta make the big return decision. Right? I look a lot of influencers

161
00:09:10,525 --> 00:09:14,405
Speaker 7:  brought the Vision Pro to make a bunch of Vision Pro views on YouTube and

162
00:09:14,405 --> 00:09:18,045
Speaker 7:  now they've returned the Vision Pro. Yes. Because why would you keep it?

163
00:09:18,905 --> 00:09:21,685
Speaker 7:  but it if that, if that's your goal, like why would you keep it? Yeah. Right.

164
00:09:21,685 --> 00:09:24,245
Speaker 7:  Like you, you've, you've milked that for all it's worth. That's

165
00:09:24,245 --> 00:09:26,845
Speaker 5:  That's how you used to be able to do like reviews and stuff. Once upon a

166
00:09:26,845 --> 00:09:30,405
Speaker 5:  time you just be like, yeah, I definitely want this very expensive product.

167
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:34,085
Speaker 7:  Right. I would just say there's a, a clout element to Vision Pro

168
00:09:34,635 --> 00:09:38,355
Speaker 7:  discourse that we keep pointing out. Like

169
00:09:38,355 --> 00:09:42,195
Speaker 7:  Vision Pro thrown at a cyber truck subscribe to my

170
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:43,435
Speaker 7:  newsletter. Like that is a whole,

171
00:09:43,435 --> 00:09:44,475
Speaker 5:  Well that one can't be returned.

172
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:49,475
Speaker 7:  Well If, you get enough newsletter subs. That's true. Signups. There's, there's

173
00:09:49,475 --> 00:09:53,435
Speaker 7:  just a whole universe of that discourse that I think we can just set aside.

174
00:09:53,435 --> 00:09:57,355
Speaker 7:  Yeah. As a family we can agree we're gonna set aside the the clout chasing

175
00:09:57,355 --> 00:10:01,315
Speaker 7:  part of the coverage. Then there's a bunch of people who are happy with

176
00:10:01,315 --> 00:10:03,635
Speaker 7:  it and they're keeping it and it works for them and they're excited and they've,

177
00:10:03,745 --> 00:10:06,355
Speaker 7:  they've got big lonely TVs to watch. That's great. We can talk about that.

178
00:10:07,605 --> 00:10:10,045
Speaker 7:  'cause I think some of that is coming into focus as well.

179
00:10:11,315 --> 00:10:15,245
Speaker 7:  Then there's the people who the hype balloon for them popped

180
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:18,005
Speaker 7:  and they are genuinely returning it for a variety of reasons.

181
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:22,565
Speaker 7:  All of which seem fairly predictable. Yes. And I think that

182
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:26,525
Speaker 7:  it's the gap between the hype and reality that is really disappointing a

183
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:30,445
Speaker 7:  bunch of people here. So people are returning it 'cause it's not

184
00:10:30,445 --> 00:10:32,925
Speaker 7:  comfortable to wear, people are returning it 'cause it makes their eyes hurt.

185
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:36,685
Speaker 7:  They're getting headaches. People are returning it because they are lonely

186
00:10:36,745 --> 00:10:40,125
Speaker 7:  in it or the pass through isn't what they thought it was gonna be. It it

187
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:40,565
Speaker 7:  feels like.

188
00:10:40,565 --> 00:10:42,405
Speaker 5:  But the Windows management was one I saw

189
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:44,565
Speaker 7:  Someone returned it over window management. Yeah. There

190
00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:47,845
Speaker 5:  Like it was one of many reasons but like a big factor for them was like,

191
00:10:47,845 --> 00:10:50,165
Speaker 5:  yeah I can't like manage the windows properly. It doesn't feel

192
00:10:50,345 --> 00:10:53,005
Speaker 7:  If. you are a person who had enough feelings about window management to return

193
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:56,205
Speaker 7:  a $3,500 computer. Please we should hang out. Yeah.

194
00:10:57,145 --> 00:10:57,765
Speaker 8:  We love you.

195
00:10:58,795 --> 00:11:02,525
Speaker 7:  Just come on over. Like we should talk. But that,

196
00:11:02,525 --> 00:11:06,365
Speaker 7:  that's how I would diagnose it right. Is the things that was promised to

197
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:06,485
Speaker 7:  do

198
00:11:08,005 --> 00:11:10,865
Speaker 7:  and then the things it can actually do and the product it is now, there is

199
00:11:10,905 --> 00:11:12,945
Speaker 7:  a pretty staggering gap between those two things.

200
00:11:13,565 --> 00:11:16,745
Speaker 8:  Yes. And I think the, the thing we've really spent the last week

201
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:21,305
Speaker 8:  kind of discovering as a society is that it turns out

202
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:25,385
Speaker 8:  that Apple having a long history of making these things work and having

203
00:11:25,505 --> 00:11:29,345
Speaker 8:  a presumably very cool roadmap doesn't mean anything for the

204
00:11:29,345 --> 00:11:32,265
Speaker 8:  thing on your face. Right? Like this is what we talked about when we did

205
00:11:32,265 --> 00:11:36,145
Speaker 8:  this review. Right. Like you can talk all you want about where this

206
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:39,425
Speaker 8:  is going and who's right about The future and the big ideas behind all of

207
00:11:39,425 --> 00:11:43,385
Speaker 8:  this and Apple's ability to execute. And I, I still have not changed

208
00:11:43,385 --> 00:11:46,265
Speaker 8:  my mind on any of that. I think If, you were to bet on a horse in this race.

209
00:11:46,275 --> 00:11:49,545
Speaker 8:  You'd be crazy not to bet on Apple just historically. That is true.

210
00:11:50,645 --> 00:11:53,765
Speaker 8:  It doesn't change anything for the fact that you just bought a very expensive

211
00:11:53,765 --> 00:11:57,485
Speaker 8:  thing that is uncomfortable to wear for a lot of people. Doesn't

212
00:11:57,705 --> 00:12:00,365
Speaker 8:  do that much for most people's use cases

213
00:12:01,545 --> 00:12:03,325
Speaker 8:  and is $3,500

214
00:12:03,995 --> 00:12:04,285
Speaker 7:  Like

215
00:12:05,065 --> 00:12:08,845
Speaker 8:  And So I think we saw a really normal thing happen,

216
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:12,805
Speaker 8:  which is a lot of people tried it, it's super cool. Like you went through

217
00:12:12,805 --> 00:12:15,965
Speaker 8:  this too, NELI like the first time you put it on, you spend a couple of hours

218
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:18,405
Speaker 8:  in it, you take it off and you're like Oh my God, that is the most impressive

219
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:22,355
Speaker 8:  thing I've ever seen. And then the fifth time you do that you're

220
00:12:22,355 --> 00:12:26,275
Speaker 8:  like, well it's, I'm not doing this 'cause it's cool. I actually need something

221
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:30,435
Speaker 8:  out of this. And the entertainment side of

222
00:12:30,435 --> 00:12:34,355
Speaker 8:  things seems to be holding up like the people who want to watch

223
00:12:34,515 --> 00:12:38,075
Speaker 8:  a large screen look at cool panoramic pictures they've taken

224
00:12:38,435 --> 00:12:42,035
Speaker 8:  whatever that seems to be working for people. But the question of a

225
00:12:42,415 --> 00:12:46,235
Speaker 8:  is that enough for this $3,500 headset and B can I

226
00:12:46,235 --> 00:12:50,195
Speaker 8:  do that comfortably? Like literally physically, comfortably.

227
00:12:50,425 --> 00:12:54,075
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Is is turning out to be a higher bar I think than a lot of people who

228
00:12:54,075 --> 00:12:54,955
Speaker 8:  bought this thing expected.

229
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:57,315
Speaker 7:  I want to stay focused on that use case.

230
00:12:58,835 --> 00:13:02,275
Speaker 7:  I would submit to you If, you take your

231
00:13:02,275 --> 00:13:05,875
Speaker 7:  $3,500 and you go and buy the

232
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:09,675
Speaker 7:  biggest TV you can get for that money, you will be happier in the long run

233
00:13:09,675 --> 00:13:12,675
Speaker 7:  than owning a first generation vision pro. Yeah. 'cause you can do TikTok

234
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:15,555
Speaker 7:  at the same time because you can do TikTok at the same, you can watch the

235
00:13:15,555 --> 00:13:19,075
Speaker 7:  show with someone else, which everyone keeps forgetting. Like maybe you're

236
00:13:19,195 --> 00:13:22,555
Speaker 7:  a solitary person and we've heard from a lot of people like this and you

237
00:13:22,555 --> 00:13:26,385
Speaker 7:  never have people over to watch TV the one time you

238
00:13:26,385 --> 00:13:29,825
Speaker 7:  want to and your only option is the vision pro. You're gonna be like Huh.

239
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:33,625
Speaker 7:  There's also just being able to move around not having the weight on your

240
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:37,425
Speaker 7:  face. There's just something about that that's different.

241
00:13:37,855 --> 00:13:41,745
Speaker 7:  Yeah. The thing you'll lose out on is the audio side of it. 'cause the

242
00:13:41,745 --> 00:13:44,745
Speaker 7:  Vision Pro is very convincing with facial audio. Especially If, you wear

243
00:13:45,055 --> 00:13:48,785
Speaker 7:  good headphones with it like AirPods Pro, that's very convincing. And

244
00:13:49,085 --> 00:13:52,975
Speaker 7:  as a travel device on an airplane, I've seen a lot of people wear this thing

245
00:13:52,975 --> 00:13:56,375
Speaker 7:  on airplanes and say I love, like for a long haul flight, you're flying

246
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:59,615
Speaker 7:  New York, San Francisco and you do the immersion and you're just like in

247
00:13:59,615 --> 00:14:03,095
Speaker 7:  space and it, you just don't feel cramped anymore. Great.

248
00:14:03,155 --> 00:14:07,135
Speaker 7:  $3,500 external battery pack. Like you're still a generation or

249
00:14:07,135 --> 00:14:10,535
Speaker 7:  two behind from that thing being valuable I would say.

250
00:14:12,325 --> 00:14:16,065
Speaker 7:  But if that's the whole value proposition, you're really

251
00:14:16,065 --> 00:14:18,865
Speaker 7:  missing out on a lot that you should be getting from a computer that can

252
00:14:18,865 --> 00:14:22,545
Speaker 7:  put Windows everywhere in your space. Yes. And I keep seeing apps that like

253
00:14:23,275 --> 00:14:27,145
Speaker 7:  could be really cool. There's one V song and I were laughing at last night.

254
00:14:27,975 --> 00:14:31,825
Speaker 7:  It's basically a virtual Peloton. So you have

255
00:14:31,885 --> 00:14:35,785
Speaker 7:  any exercise bike, preferably one with like Bluetooth that compared to a

256
00:14:35,785 --> 00:14:39,545
Speaker 7:  thing over Ant or whatever protocol that is. And it just

257
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,345
Speaker 7:  mounts a big virtual screen in front of you and then you go on a bike ride.

258
00:14:43,245 --> 00:14:44,225
Speaker 7:  That's cool. Yeah.

259
00:14:44,225 --> 00:14:45,425
Speaker 8:  That is cool. I love

260
00:14:45,425 --> 00:14:48,105
Speaker 7:  That. Yeah. Super cool. And then it's like you have to wear Vision Pro in

261
00:14:48,105 --> 00:14:51,765
Speaker 7:  your head to do it with an external batter pad with a sweat. Yeah. It's like

262
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:55,645
Speaker 7:  none. It's not made for that. Yeah. Like it just isn't made for that. And

263
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,925
Speaker 7:  then there's the other app that everyone keeps talking about, which is the

264
00:14:57,985 --> 00:15:01,555
Speaker 7:  Mac display. And I thought it was utterly

265
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:05,635
Speaker 7:  fascinating that a lot of the first conversation you saw from Vision Pro

266
00:15:05,635 --> 00:15:08,835
Speaker 7:  owners was the killer app for this thing is my Mac.

267
00:15:09,545 --> 00:15:13,355
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Which is wild. Like just wild.

268
00:15:13,355 --> 00:15:16,355
Speaker 7:  Like the application model has nothing to do with spatial computing. It's

269
00:15:16,355 --> 00:15:20,315
Speaker 7:  just a big window into your Mac. The Mac is notably much more open

270
00:15:20,385 --> 00:15:24,195
Speaker 7:  than an iOS or iPad always based device. So what you want is your Mac applications

271
00:15:24,495 --> 00:15:28,395
Speaker 7:  and then you have this big screen and Apple keeps billing

272
00:15:28,435 --> 00:15:31,995
Speaker 7:  it as a 4K screen. And then over time you started seeing people say, this

273
00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:35,235
Speaker 7:  is actually kinda a little blurry. This isn't as sharp as I thought it was.

274
00:15:35,855 --> 00:15:39,835
Speaker 7:  And it's because Apple is making a 5K like an

275
00:15:39,865 --> 00:15:43,475
Speaker 7:  iMac display or a studio display. They're that resolution, they're, they're

276
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:47,315
Speaker 7:  making a virtual one of those at that resolution and

277
00:15:47,435 --> 00:15:51,275
Speaker 7:  then they're down rising it to 4K and sending a 4K video stream of

278
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:51,475
Speaker 7:  that

279
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:55,875
Speaker 8:  Lies, which you can then scale infinitely to whatever weird size

280
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:56,155
Speaker 8:  you want.

281
00:15:56,295 --> 00:15:58,835
Speaker 7:  And So I called this out in the review and it was just like one of those

282
00:15:58,835 --> 00:16:02,755
Speaker 7:  things like, so hard to explain it. So much of this device

283
00:16:02,755 --> 00:16:06,075
Speaker 7:  is once you see it for yourself, you get it, but it is really hard to explain.

284
00:16:06,075 --> 00:16:09,275
Speaker 7:  You're looking at the screen that seems sharp and then

285
00:16:10,005 --> 00:16:13,555
Speaker 7:  underneath it are like five scaling operations. Mm.

286
00:16:13,815 --> 00:16:17,635
Speaker 7:  And then on top of it there's Foveated rendering. So you've made

287
00:16:17,635 --> 00:16:21,555
Speaker 7:  this huge Mac display that is already fuzzy because of

288
00:16:21,555 --> 00:16:25,395
Speaker 7:  the scaling steps in between the virtual display that's created, that's

289
00:16:25,395 --> 00:16:28,475
Speaker 7:  5K that's being scaled down to 4K and sent to the headset and then you've

290
00:16:28,475 --> 00:16:31,755
Speaker 7:  made it really big. And then If, you look at the center of it, the edges

291
00:16:31,755 --> 00:16:35,735
Speaker 7:  of it are blurry because of the Foveated rendering. And so people

292
00:16:35,735 --> 00:16:38,655
Speaker 7:  are just sort of running into the reality of what that screen really looks

293
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,975
Speaker 7:  like. And they're like, oh, my application model is still the Mac.

294
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:43,575
Speaker 7:  I should just use my Mac.

295
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:47,815
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Right. And I think the other part of that is also to your point about,

296
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:51,295
Speaker 8:  it's not super clear until you see it. The actual

297
00:16:51,365 --> 00:16:54,975
Speaker 8:  interaction of the Mac apps on my Mac,

298
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:59,295
Speaker 8:  the Vision Pro apps that are actually optimized for this spatial

299
00:16:59,295 --> 00:17:03,175
Speaker 8:  computing and the iPad apps that run in the Vision Pro is

300
00:17:03,195 --> 00:17:07,055
Speaker 8:  not good. Like you, you can technically have all of those things but

301
00:17:07,055 --> 00:17:10,415
Speaker 8:  the world you want, and I think the world a lot of people expected is one

302
00:17:10,415 --> 00:17:14,055
Speaker 8:  where all of my apps are just all of my apps and some of them run on my

303
00:17:14,055 --> 00:17:17,255
Speaker 8:  device, some of them run on my Mac, but I can just sort of put them all anywhere

304
00:17:17,255 --> 00:17:21,095
Speaker 8:  and they all interact and that's pretty cool. That is not at all how

305
00:17:21,095 --> 00:17:24,975
Speaker 8:  it works. And I think that like the people who are mad about the window management

306
00:17:24,995 --> 00:17:28,895
Speaker 8:  are the ones who are like, well either the idea of being able to leave

307
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:33,175
Speaker 8:  my email in the other room is actually like not a good thing.

308
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:37,215
Speaker 8:  It's neat but it's stupid. And why would I want that? Or

309
00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:41,255
Speaker 8:  this thing about like, okay, I, I've been promised something like sort of

310
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:45,295
Speaker 8:  world scale app multitasking and this

311
00:17:45,295 --> 00:17:49,095
Speaker 8:  is actually a tiny little slice of that plus a bunch of other

312
00:17:49,405 --> 00:17:52,485
Speaker 8:  slightly confusing things to me. This is like when they put stage manager

313
00:17:52,545 --> 00:17:56,365
Speaker 8:  on the iPad and you're like, I can see what you were going for here. You

314
00:17:56,365 --> 00:17:59,725
Speaker 8:  just missed it by about 30%. And it kind of kills the whole premise. For

315
00:17:59,725 --> 00:17:59,805
Speaker 8:  me,

316
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:04,625
Speaker 7:  The two things that I think would make that much better. And you can see

317
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,945
Speaker 7:  them and I think that's the 30% one,

318
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:10,385
Speaker 7:  they have to make it smaller. Like

319
00:18:12,245 --> 00:18:15,265
Speaker 7:  the hardware is not ready for the software. Yes. Like I, I have come back

320
00:18:15,265 --> 00:18:18,985
Speaker 7:  to that several times. Like one way to think about this is that this is a

321
00:18:18,985 --> 00:18:22,465
Speaker 7:  simulator for the hardware they want to build. And you can see putting windows

322
00:18:22,495 --> 00:18:26,105
Speaker 7:  over your house and like having digital objects everywhere would be amazing.

323
00:18:26,965 --> 00:18:29,705
Speaker 7:  But then you, you have to wear a vision pro. And every time I see a cool

324
00:18:29,705 --> 00:18:33,585
Speaker 7:  Vision Pro app, I think yes. But to have this experience, you've gotta put

325
00:18:33,585 --> 00:18:36,505
Speaker 7:  all that weight on your head. And for some people that's fine. I I don't

326
00:18:36,505 --> 00:18:39,945
Speaker 7:  wanna discount the people who are like, that's great. But the re the reality

327
00:18:39,945 --> 00:18:43,025
Speaker 7:  of it is then you degrade real, like literally degrade reality.

328
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:47,345
Speaker 7:  You, you are wearing a vision pro on your face and the world around you is

329
00:18:47,345 --> 00:18:49,985
Speaker 7:  a lot grainier and there's an ocean blur and the pass through isn't good.

330
00:18:50,405 --> 00:18:54,225
Speaker 7:  And you are prioritizing the digital world over the real world. And

331
00:18:54,305 --> 00:18:55,905
Speaker 7:  I, I just don't think that's an appropriate show.

332
00:18:55,905 --> 00:18:58,785
Speaker 5:  And the moment you walk into a dark room, you just see mud. Right?

333
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:03,225
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I mean it's it's a camera. Yeah. Like you just cannot overcome

334
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,425
Speaker 7:  cameras. Right. And I have now talked to because in the review

335
00:19:07,385 --> 00:19:10,265
Speaker 7:  I basically called the top on pastor. I was like, it can get better

336
00:19:11,845 --> 00:19:15,745
Speaker 7:  but it can't get 5000% better. Right. And If

337
00:19:15,745 --> 00:19:19,225
Speaker 7:  you did like by the time you get that much better, some other technology

338
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:22,505
Speaker 7:  will come along and be disruptive and very smart people disagree with me

339
00:19:22,665 --> 00:19:26,505
Speaker 7:  on this. I fine. you know, like Who knows. But we

340
00:19:26,505 --> 00:19:30,425
Speaker 7:  all agreed that the timeline for that is 10 years out. Yeah. And I am

341
00:19:30,425 --> 00:19:34,105
Speaker 7:  just not making any predictions on what happens in 10 years of technology

342
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:34,865
Speaker 7:  development. Well and

343
00:19:35,385 --> 00:19:37,745
Speaker 5:  I like, I think we, a bunch of us in the office have been talking about how

344
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:41,505
Speaker 5:  would you shrink this headset? Like did they make a design mistake? And,

345
00:19:41,505 --> 00:19:43,505
Speaker 5:  and a lot of people are like, well why didn't they just take that computer

346
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:47,105
Speaker 5:  and put it with a battery pack? Right? Yeah. And just take a lot of that

347
00:19:47,105 --> 00:19:50,225
Speaker 5:  weight out. But then If, you put it with a battery pack, you'd effectively

348
00:19:50,225 --> 00:19:53,945
Speaker 5:  be carrying around like a Mac Mini in your pocket with a battery

349
00:19:54,425 --> 00:19:54,785
Speaker 5:  attached to it.

350
00:19:55,185 --> 00:19:56,545
Speaker 7:  Backpack, full Apple backpack, backpack,

351
00:19:56,725 --> 00:19:56,945
Speaker 5:  Big

352
00:19:57,035 --> 00:19:58,225
Speaker 7:  Puffy white straps.

353
00:19:58,475 --> 00:20:02,385
Speaker 5:  You'd need fans to cool it. Who knows if it can like

354
00:20:02,705 --> 00:20:06,665
Speaker 5:  actually be fast enough along that wire to, to do all the stu all the incredible

355
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:10,345
Speaker 5:  processing it's doing. Yeah. It's like, no it's actually a really com

356
00:20:10,415 --> 00:20:13,985
Speaker 5:  like I keep going back to it. It's a really fascinating device 'cause it

357
00:20:13,985 --> 00:20:17,585
Speaker 5:  is so complex. It is such like exquisitely

358
00:20:17,905 --> 00:20:20,955
Speaker 5:  designed device that doesn't do a whole lot,

359
00:20:21,495 --> 00:20:24,755
Speaker 7:  But that part of it where it doesn't do a whole lot. That's because it's

360
00:20:24,755 --> 00:20:27,995
Speaker 7:  new. Like there's no apps for it. Yeah. We saw a report this week from Immersive

361
00:20:28,105 --> 00:20:32,075
Speaker 7:  Wire, I wanna say it was that most vision apps hit

362
00:20:32,075 --> 00:20:36,035
Speaker 7:  a ceiling of 1000 downloads. Hmm. Like very few people have

363
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:39,115
Speaker 7:  this product V like vanishingly few people have this product.

364
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,955
Speaker 7:  Vanishingly few app developers have started building apps that are made for

365
00:20:42,955 --> 00:20:44,955
Speaker 7:  it. That's that's a cycle that Yeah.

366
00:20:44,955 --> 00:20:48,245
Speaker 5:  That and that's a cycle that's gonna continue because if no one's making

367
00:20:48,245 --> 00:20:51,525
Speaker 5:  apps for it, then nobody's buying it. And if no one's buying it, then no

368
00:20:51,525 --> 00:20:52,525
Speaker 5:  one's making apps for it.

369
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:56,805
Speaker 8:  I do think what's clear is that this is a repeat of the, you can't

370
00:20:56,805 --> 00:21:00,725
Speaker 8:  just blow up an iPhone app and have it work on the iPad problem, which Apple

371
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:04,605
Speaker 8:  thought that ecosystem would buy it a ton of time and

372
00:21:05,035 --> 00:21:08,485
Speaker 8:  that it didn't. Like luckily Apple was able to get the iPad ecosystem going

373
00:21:08,485 --> 00:21:11,925
Speaker 8:  very quickly because the, you will just two x your iPhone app and it'll be

374
00:21:11,925 --> 00:21:15,245
Speaker 8:  great was a total non-starter. And I think we're going through that again

375
00:21:15,245 --> 00:21:19,085
Speaker 8:  where it turns out iPad apps are not the answer. Like we, we,

376
00:21:19,675 --> 00:21:22,925
Speaker 8:  what we have seen overwhelmingly so far is people being like, there's some

377
00:21:22,925 --> 00:21:26,805
Speaker 8:  cool stuff. Even Apple now is going into Apple Arcade and saying here's some

378
00:21:26,805 --> 00:21:30,405
Speaker 8:  of the stuff you can actually use for spatial. It's cool this idea that

379
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:34,405
Speaker 8:  you know, you have access to this giant set of apps and it will get us there

380
00:21:34,425 --> 00:21:37,645
Speaker 8:  and buy us enough time to get to the next thing I'm less convinced of

381
00:21:38,455 --> 00:21:41,965
Speaker 8:  every day. Yeah. Because it just doesn't seem to be wor it, it doesn't seem

382
00:21:41,965 --> 00:21:43,805
Speaker 8:  to be sort of satiating people that way.

383
00:21:44,145 --> 00:21:47,845
Speaker 7:  So I wanna talk about one more limitation that I think the community has

384
00:21:48,165 --> 00:21:51,525
Speaker 7:  discovered of this thing and then I want to talk about Mark Zuckerberg reviewing

385
00:21:51,525 --> 00:21:52,205
Speaker 7:  it. Yes. Yes.

386
00:21:52,235 --> 00:21:52,525
Speaker 5:  That

387
00:21:52,525 --> 00:21:56,485
Speaker 7:  Was the best. Which is deeply un as a professional reviewer, all

388
00:21:56,485 --> 00:21:59,885
Speaker 7:  I could think of is, boy I hope more CEOs try to take my business.

389
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:04,885
Speaker 7:  Like just get out there soon. Dar Phai, just start reviewing stuff. Be like,

390
00:22:05,105 --> 00:22:08,965
Speaker 7:  review the pixel. He should review the pixel soon. Dar

391
00:22:08,965 --> 00:22:12,725
Speaker 7:  phai pick up a pixel challenge, pay attention to the pixel

392
00:22:12,725 --> 00:22:13,125
Speaker 7:  challenge

393
00:22:15,505 --> 00:22:19,445
Speaker 7:  the other limitation that I think is really weird and add a piece on

394
00:22:19,445 --> 00:22:22,405
Speaker 7:  this, on the site. By the time you're listening to this, the people in the,

395
00:22:22,405 --> 00:22:25,245
Speaker 7:  like the Vision Pro subreddit and the people that I've seen in other places

396
00:22:25,265 --> 00:22:29,045
Speaker 7:  online do not think Apple's default fitment is good.

397
00:22:29,475 --> 00:22:32,565
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Right. So they're like, you go in, you get your face scanned or you

398
00:22:32,565 --> 00:22:35,605
Speaker 7:  do the iPhone scan and you get a light seal and all of them are like, get

399
00:22:35,685 --> 00:22:39,045
Speaker 7:  a smaller light seal. Some people are like, take the lights off and mash

400
00:22:39,045 --> 00:22:43,025
Speaker 7:  it against your face, which I tried. It is very convincing in terms

401
00:22:43,025 --> 00:22:46,145
Speaker 7:  of field of view, get a huge field of view. I felt like I was underwater.

402
00:22:46,175 --> 00:22:49,545
Speaker 7:  Like the ones that are not designed to be smashed directly against your eyeballs,

403
00:22:49,925 --> 00:22:53,145
Speaker 7:  but they're like, get a different light seal. Make it smaller. Like mess

404
00:22:53,145 --> 00:22:57,065
Speaker 7:  with the fit because they don't think that the fit that Apple is giving

405
00:22:57,065 --> 00:22:57,745
Speaker 7:  people is Right.

406
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:00,985
Speaker 8:  Which we've discovered Apple really does not want you to do. Right. Like

407
00:23:00,985 --> 00:23:01,545
Speaker 8:  it's, it's,

408
00:23:01,545 --> 00:23:02,665
Speaker 7:  They really don't want you to do that.

409
00:23:02,845 --> 00:23:05,825
Speaker 8:  You can't just walk in and buy three light seals and see which one you like

410
00:23:05,825 --> 00:23:07,065
Speaker 8:  the best. Right, right. Because they're

411
00:23:07,065 --> 00:23:07,865
Speaker 5:  $200.

412
00:23:07,975 --> 00:23:11,185
Speaker 7:  Well they're $200. But, so like I'll just, I'll make that concrete for if

413
00:23:11,185 --> 00:23:15,105
Speaker 7:  you're listening. We have a review unit, we want more people

414
00:23:15,205 --> 00:23:19,145
Speaker 7:  on our team to use it. We want to make more videos or we have ideas on how

415
00:23:19,145 --> 00:23:22,385
Speaker 7:  to cover it. Even if we bought another one, even if we sent the review unit

416
00:23:22,385 --> 00:23:26,265
Speaker 7:  from Apple back and we just bought one in order to be fair in

417
00:23:26,465 --> 00:23:29,665
Speaker 7:  coverage, as more people use the thing, we have to make sure it fits them

418
00:23:29,665 --> 00:23:33,385
Speaker 7:  because if it doesn't fit right, the eye tracking goes completely wonky and

419
00:23:33,385 --> 00:23:37,305
Speaker 7:  people get headaches. So, okay. I told Owen,

420
00:23:37,605 --> 00:23:39,945
Speaker 7:  our video director, let's just go to the Apple store, just like buy a bunch

421
00:23:39,945 --> 00:23:43,745
Speaker 7:  of light seals. Turns out there are 17 sizes, they're $200

422
00:23:43,865 --> 00:23:47,845
Speaker 7:  a piece and Apple won't let you just buy some. Yeah. You cannot go

423
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:49,525
Speaker 7:  to an Apple store and just buy some, they

424
00:23:49,525 --> 00:23:52,525
Speaker 5:  Keep him in a drawer behind. Like you have to ask someone and then they'll

425
00:23:52,525 --> 00:23:52,605
Speaker 5:  be

426
00:23:52,705 --> 00:23:56,685
Speaker 7:  Is Owen who made the Vision Pro video with like Owen is on

427
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,885
Speaker 7:  that team, he edited that video. They made him sit for the demo,

428
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:03,685
Speaker 7:  the full half hour demo and then they let him buy one in his size.

429
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:08,485
Speaker 7:  And it's like, why? Like just we wanna give you money. Yeah.

430
00:24:09,025 --> 00:24:12,045
Speaker 7:  Up to $4,000. Like

431
00:24:12,825 --> 00:24:15,805
Speaker 7:  If, you walk into any store and you're like, I'll just, here's $4,000. Just

432
00:24:15,805 --> 00:24:19,645
Speaker 7:  gimme one of everything. Few stores in America will be like, no, you

433
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:21,805
Speaker 7:  just actually there's a process here. Yeah, yeah.

434
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:24,885
Speaker 5:  Aires would be like, get out. You get one.

435
00:24:25,115 --> 00:24:28,645
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And when you think of the Vision Pro Light Seal, you immediately leap

436
00:24:28,645 --> 00:24:29,245
Speaker 7:  to Hermes.

437
00:24:29,645 --> 00:24:32,685
Speaker 5:  A hundred percent. Same experience. Same. Like I walk in, I'm like, Ooh,

438
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:34,405
Speaker 5:  do I have enough money to be in here right now?

439
00:24:34,595 --> 00:24:38,165
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Yeah. It's Barney's Aires and the Vision Pro Light Seal

440
00:24:38,425 --> 00:24:42,045
Speaker 7:  in terms of luxury purchasing experiences. You can't just buy a Ferrari.

441
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:45,485
Speaker 7:  You gotta buy a bad Ferrari first. Yeah. You can't just buy a vision for

442
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:49,285
Speaker 7:  a light seal. You gotta sit down for 30 minutes first.

443
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:53,805
Speaker 7:  So that is annoying on its face. If, you buy

444
00:24:53,805 --> 00:24:57,645
Speaker 7:  it for enterprise use. I've seen a lot of designers, like we want bought

445
00:24:57,645 --> 00:25:01,485
Speaker 7:  one for our office so we could like share it as a 3D modeling tool. And they're

446
00:25:01,485 --> 00:25:04,605
Speaker 7:  like, this is just like not designed to be shared If. you spend

447
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:07,805
Speaker 7:  $3,500 to have it as a cool tv.

448
00:25:09,685 --> 00:25:13,545
Speaker 7:  It is challenging to get it to fit the other people.

449
00:25:14,285 --> 00:25:18,185
Speaker 7:  That's just physically Yeah. You can accomplish the goal. but

450
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:21,665
Speaker 7:  it is challenging to be like, this computer is available for someone in this

451
00:25:21,665 --> 00:25:24,945
Speaker 7:  office to use. Here's a selection of things that make it fit your head.

452
00:25:25,335 --> 00:25:27,345
Speaker 5:  It's so consumer hostile.

453
00:25:28,165 --> 00:25:31,985
Speaker 7:  Th so the, there's a, I think there's a connection except here. Yeah. I

454
00:25:32,065 --> 00:25:35,785
Speaker 7:  I it's too new. Yeah. I think they just shipped the thing. There's

455
00:25:35,975 --> 00:25:38,585
Speaker 7:  like, you know, you all know how I feel about headphone jacks? Like yeah,

456
00:25:38,895 --> 00:25:42,825
Speaker 7:  that was a hostile move. This is like, the product isn't ready

457
00:25:43,045 --> 00:25:46,705
Speaker 7:  to support that thing. And the way that it's in particular

458
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:49,985
Speaker 7:  not ready is iOS and iPad os have no

459
00:25:50,275 --> 00:25:53,785
Speaker 7:  affordance for multi-user support. Yeah. So the vision pro

460
00:25:54,285 --> 00:25:58,225
Speaker 7:  it, it has optic ID in it. It can scan your eyes and log you

461
00:25:58,225 --> 00:26:02,105
Speaker 7:  in. It should be able to scan my eyes or your eyes or David's

462
00:26:02,105 --> 00:26:05,185
Speaker 7:  eyes or someone else's eyes and be like, here's your account. You're you,

463
00:26:05,325 --> 00:26:09,225
Speaker 7:  we know you're you. Here's your account and here's your stuff. And

464
00:26:09,225 --> 00:26:13,135
Speaker 7:  it has nothing. And like on top of it, it has none

465
00:26:13,135 --> 00:26:13,615
Speaker 7:  of the like

466
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:19,815
Speaker 7:  recalibrations stored. So if I have one, if I have a

467
00:26:19,815 --> 00:26:23,735
Speaker 7:  vision pro and I lend it to you, thanks. Every time I lend it

468
00:26:23,735 --> 00:26:26,775
Speaker 7:  to you, you have to recalibrate. I have to put it in guess mode and you have

469
00:26:26,775 --> 00:26:27,695
Speaker 7:  to recalibrate it for your eyes.

470
00:26:27,885 --> 00:26:28,695
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That's stupid.

471
00:26:28,925 --> 00:26:31,935
Speaker 8:  That has to, that was a deliberate choice though, right? That has to have

472
00:26:31,935 --> 00:26:35,215
Speaker 8:  been a deliberate choice by Apple to make it hard for you

473
00:26:36,155 --> 00:26:39,135
Speaker 8:  to share this thing with people. Because why, for all the reasons you've

474
00:26:39,135 --> 00:26:42,895
Speaker 8:  been talking about that the hardware is not set up for success

475
00:26:43,065 --> 00:26:44,405
Speaker 8:  for you to be sharing this

476
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:45,125
Speaker 5:  Thing. But why?

477
00:26:47,045 --> 00:26:49,385
Speaker 5:  That's why I think it's a hostile because they never, 'cause

478
00:26:49,385 --> 00:26:49,825
Speaker 8:  It's not finished,

479
00:26:50,045 --> 00:26:53,465
Speaker 7:  But they cannot possibly like it's hostile when like, I don't think it's

480
00:26:53,465 --> 00:26:56,785
Speaker 7:  like Apple is hostile. Okay. So let me explain why think the headphone jack

481
00:26:56,785 --> 00:27:00,105
Speaker 7:  is hostile. Let me rewind this conversation. They took out a headphone jack.

482
00:27:00,105 --> 00:27:02,825
Speaker 7:  They didn't need to, especially as the funds started getting bigger, they

483
00:27:02,825 --> 00:27:05,065
Speaker 7:  did that because they wanted AirPods to succeed. AirPods are a huge success.

484
00:27:05,105 --> 00:27:07,345
Speaker 7:  I know people love their AirPods. I know people think we were wrong about

485
00:27:07,345 --> 00:27:07,785
Speaker 7:  AirPods.

486
00:27:09,555 --> 00:27:12,525
Speaker 7:  They basically created a market for proprietary headphones. Yes.

487
00:27:13,275 --> 00:27:15,765
Speaker 7:  AirPods are proprietary headphones. Yes. Like I know they run Bluetooth,

488
00:27:15,765 --> 00:27:17,565
Speaker 7:  but they actually run a special version of Bluetooth.

489
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:21,405
Speaker 5:  Kinzie's Kinzie gets you on that one. They, they, they're, they're all like,

490
00:27:21,505 --> 00:27:24,565
Speaker 5:  can you believe they, they got rid of the headphone jack who allowed that.

491
00:27:24,705 --> 00:27:26,565
Speaker 5:  And I'm like, we wrote about it all the

492
00:27:26,565 --> 00:27:29,605
Speaker 7:  Time. I I did my best. But like that was straight and hostile. Like they

493
00:27:29,605 --> 00:27:31,925
Speaker 7:  created a market for Proprie headphones and they flooded the market with

494
00:27:31,925 --> 00:27:34,805
Speaker 7:  their own iPads. Yes. I'm aware that people really like them. Whatever. It's

495
00:27:34,805 --> 00:27:38,725
Speaker 7:  a thing that happened not allowing multiple users on the iPad at this

496
00:27:38,725 --> 00:27:42,525
Speaker 7:  point in the iPad's history a little bit Hostile. Hostile. Yeah. You

497
00:27:42,525 --> 00:27:46,285
Speaker 7:  have families, people share their iPads, schools there,

498
00:27:46,355 --> 00:27:50,245
Speaker 7:  there's some enterprise support. Yeah. For shared accounts on iOS devices

499
00:27:50,825 --> 00:27:54,045
Speaker 7:  if you're in a school or a business. But a regular person who spends five,

500
00:27:54,145 --> 00:27:57,925
Speaker 7:  six, $700 on iPad that is not a family device by any stretch of the

501
00:27:57,925 --> 00:28:01,205
Speaker 7:  imagination is locked to one user. Yep. Because Apple wants you to buy multiple

502
00:28:01,205 --> 00:28:03,965
Speaker 7:  iPads. Right. They want everyone in your family to have an iPad. Okay. There's

503
00:28:03,965 --> 00:28:07,765
Speaker 7:  some just raw capitalistic user hostility there. Yeah, fine. They're the

504
00:28:07,765 --> 00:28:11,725
Speaker 7:  richest company in the world. What a shock. I think with the Vision Pro there,

505
00:28:11,725 --> 00:28:15,565
Speaker 7:  there's no expectation that a family of four is gonna

506
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:19,365
Speaker 7:  buy four Vision Pros. No, I agree. And I, I think that that's why I'm like

507
00:28:19,385 --> 00:28:22,685
Speaker 7:  not ready to call it. I I I don't think, I think they just shipped the product

508
00:28:22,685 --> 00:28:23,325
Speaker 7:  that was done.

509
00:28:23,765 --> 00:28:27,685
Speaker 5:  I think it was hostile design. I don't think it's necessarily like

510
00:28:28,215 --> 00:28:31,805
Speaker 5:  Apple was set out to, to had a big vision here. I think it was just,

511
00:28:32,235 --> 00:28:35,845
Speaker 5:  well we wanna make this thing as cool as possible and that means we need

512
00:28:35,845 --> 00:28:39,245
Speaker 5:  to make it as finicky as possible regardless of what that means for like

513
00:28:39,265 --> 00:28:42,245
Speaker 5:  use cases for other people. Because we wanna make it as cool as possible.

514
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:46,405
Speaker 5:  And that's hostile to the users because then they can't share it. They can't

515
00:28:46,585 --> 00:28:49,445
Speaker 5:  do anything with it. They have to, they do have to go buy another one or

516
00:28:49,445 --> 00:28:52,445
Speaker 5:  they have to go buy a $200 light seal if they wanna have that experience

517
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:55,445
Speaker 5:  And like, I don't wanna say the Quest Pro is a good product,

518
00:28:56,465 --> 00:28:58,325
Speaker 5:  but that part of it,

519
00:28:58,525 --> 00:29:02,085
Speaker 7:  I just remind everyone we gave the Quest Pro a four. Yeah. And the headline

520
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:03,525
Speaker 7:  was, get me out of here.

521
00:29:04,305 --> 00:29:07,965
Speaker 5:  But could you put it on like, when you put it on your head, did it fit?

522
00:29:08,145 --> 00:29:10,845
Speaker 5:  Did you have to go buy a $200 light seal to make sure it worked?

523
00:29:11,785 --> 00:29:15,685
Speaker 8:  Oh no. So I. I, I don't buy that premise at all honestly. Okay.

524
00:29:15,685 --> 00:29:19,245
Speaker 8:  Like if, have you ever put on somebody else's headset and you spend 15 minutes

525
00:29:19,765 --> 00:29:22,685
Speaker 8:  screwing around with the lenses and the strap to get it to fit your head?

526
00:29:22,685 --> 00:29:24,245
Speaker 8:  Like it's, there's just

527
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:24,965
Speaker 5:  No awkward. I love that

528
00:29:24,965 --> 00:29:27,205
Speaker 8:  World. Which awkward. Which you have a good experience using these things.

529
00:29:27,295 --> 00:29:30,525
Speaker 8:  Ironically, it's one of the reasons I think Meta

530
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:34,645
Speaker 8:  Ray band strategy is closer to the right one because that's just a pair of

531
00:29:34,645 --> 00:29:38,525
Speaker 8:  glasses that is Yeah. Much closer to a thing you can just put on anyone's

532
00:29:38,525 --> 00:29:41,445
Speaker 8:  head and it will more or less work. Yeah. You might look stupid in them,

533
00:29:41,445 --> 00:29:45,365
Speaker 8:  but it's just a pair of glasses. Whereas something like

534
00:29:45,365 --> 00:29:48,285
Speaker 8:  this is just by definition, so

535
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:53,045
Speaker 8:  individual user-centric that I think for Apple to say, oh,

536
00:29:53,215 --> 00:29:55,765
Speaker 8:  share it with your friends, they're gonna have a trash experience in it.

537
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:58,245
Speaker 8:  It's actually a bad idea. Like I think if If you get to,

538
00:29:58,245 --> 00:30:01,165
Speaker 5:  No, I think it was a bad idea. What I'm saying is go further back. I think

539
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:03,245
Speaker 5:  it was a bad idea to design a product. Well

540
00:30:03,245 --> 00:30:06,525
Speaker 8:  You're just arguing it was a bad idea to ship the Vision pro, which is fine.

541
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,125
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I just don that's just that that ship's

542
00:30:09,985 --> 00:30:13,165
Speaker 5:  To say, Hey we we're gonna charge you $200 for a light seal. Hey we're gonna

543
00:30:13,165 --> 00:30:16,565
Speaker 5:  make it so extraordinary for one person and no one else. I think that's just

544
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,485
Speaker 5:  inherently hostile design.

545
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:22,165
Speaker 8:  I will say I do think an interesting question that is becoming more and more

546
00:30:22,395 --> 00:30:26,285
Speaker 8:  open is whether Apple overshot, and

547
00:30:26,285 --> 00:30:28,965
Speaker 8:  this is where we should get into Mark Zuckerberg's review of this thing because

548
00:30:28,965 --> 00:30:31,845
Speaker 8:  it's part of the case that he made, which is that Apple basically came out

549
00:30:31,845 --> 00:30:34,965
Speaker 8:  and said, we are going to make the best, most

550
00:30:35,255 --> 00:30:39,125
Speaker 8:  impressive, most incredible thing possible. Every other

551
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:43,085
Speaker 8:  consequence be damned. Right. And it did that by all accounts. Like I

552
00:30:43,085 --> 00:30:46,805
Speaker 8:  don't, I don't think it missed in terms of doing the best anyone possibly

553
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:49,685
Speaker 8:  can at, at this moment in time on very many fronts,

554
00:30:50,985 --> 00:30:54,925
Speaker 8:  is doing that a better idea than making

555
00:30:55,045 --> 00:30:58,405
Speaker 8:  something that is 85% as good and maybe half the weight?

556
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:03,125
Speaker 8:  Dunno. Like is, is it something that Apple

557
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:06,725
Speaker 8:  should have shipped that was much closer to just a screen

558
00:31:07,225 --> 00:31:10,885
Speaker 8:  and an entertainment device as opposed to trying to do all of this other

559
00:31:10,885 --> 00:31:14,725
Speaker 8:  stuff? These, I think this roadmap Apple has set

560
00:31:14,725 --> 00:31:17,525
Speaker 8:  itself on where it made the best thing possible and it's just gonna try to

561
00:31:17,525 --> 00:31:21,485
Speaker 8:  bring it down in all of those ways over time towards people is a

562
00:31:21,765 --> 00:31:25,565
Speaker 8:  strategy. But I think it's, it's less and less obvious to me that

563
00:31:25,565 --> 00:31:28,965
Speaker 8:  it's the right one because it's like you, you want that to be the luxury

564
00:31:29,175 --> 00:31:32,325
Speaker 8:  thing that not everybody can afford, but everybody who can really loves.

565
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:36,125
Speaker 8:  And even that is not what it's getting right now. Right. It's not like the

566
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:39,965
Speaker 8:  Tesla Roadster or the super expensive first luxury

567
00:31:40,035 --> 00:31:44,005
Speaker 8:  item you see from a lot of companies. It's not even working for those

568
00:31:44,005 --> 00:31:45,165
Speaker 8:  people. It's

569
00:31:45,165 --> 00:31:48,925
Speaker 5:  Not the the Samsung flip phones, right? Yeah. Like, like that was, that was

570
00:31:48,925 --> 00:31:52,405
Speaker 5:  the thing. It was like, okay, there's a lot of flaws in this If, you peel

571
00:31:52,405 --> 00:31:56,125
Speaker 5:  this part off, it will destroy it and then Samsung will not be happy.

572
00:31:56,125 --> 00:32:00,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But like it still worked pretty well and

573
00:32:00,315 --> 00:32:03,205
Speaker 5:  more, I mean yeah, more than one person could use it, but it actually did

574
00:32:03,205 --> 00:32:06,125
Speaker 5:  the it it delivered on the promise. And this feels like it doesn't always,

575
00:32:06,185 --> 00:32:08,325
Speaker 7:  But the promise there was just it unfolds. Yeah.

576
00:32:08,705 --> 00:32:09,565
Speaker 5:  It was a much simpler

577
00:32:09,565 --> 00:32:13,165
Speaker 7:  Promise. Right. The promise that Apple is making is we will intermediate

578
00:32:13,395 --> 00:32:14,165
Speaker 7:  reality for

579
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:16,765
Speaker 5:  You. And that was perhaps too big a promise to make.

580
00:32:17,325 --> 00:32:20,725
Speaker 7:  I think David said this Yeah. A couple weeks ago, which is with the Apple

581
00:32:20,725 --> 00:32:24,485
Speaker 7:  Watch. And so, so many people have compared the Vision Pro to the Apple Watch,

582
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:28,375
Speaker 7:  which I'm just gonna remind everyone I got right in that review

583
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:28,495
Speaker 7:  too.

584
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:34,295
Speaker 7:  But the a watch underwent drastic, drastic changes. But

585
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:36,575
Speaker 7:  David, I think it was, you said this a couple weeks ago, they got the form

586
00:32:36,575 --> 00:32:39,015
Speaker 7:  factor, right? Yes. Everyone knew that this is how it should look and all

587
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:42,565
Speaker 7:  you're doing is refining the thing around

588
00:32:43,025 --> 00:32:46,885
Speaker 7:  the shape that it should be. And here it just seems

589
00:32:47,115 --> 00:32:50,965
Speaker 7:  obvious that the form factor isn't right. Right. That they shouldn't

590
00:32:50,985 --> 00:32:54,285
Speaker 7:  do pass through in this way. That what you want is all you want glasses.

591
00:32:55,065 --> 00:32:59,005
Speaker 7:  So I think that does bring it to the Zuckerberg review, which

592
00:32:59,005 --> 00:33:01,565
Speaker 7:  again, I think every CEO should just review their competitors' products like

593
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:03,725
Speaker 7:  head on a hundred percent. David, do you want to tell us what's going on

594
00:33:03,725 --> 00:33:04,005
Speaker 7:  with Mark?

595
00:33:04,235 --> 00:33:08,005
Speaker 8:  Sure. Okay. So let me, let me just briefly set the scene for you here. So

596
00:33:08,075 --> 00:33:11,525
Speaker 8:  Mark Zuckerberg and his newly long hair, which that's beautiful,

597
00:33:11,635 --> 00:33:14,645
Speaker 8:  shocked we have not talked about in this show yet, but we'll just leave that

598
00:33:15,395 --> 00:33:19,325
Speaker 8:  sitting on a couch in a, in a, you know, dark long sleeve

599
00:33:19,325 --> 00:33:23,165
Speaker 8:  shirt I think with an immaculately fluffed pillow behind

600
00:33:23,165 --> 00:33:26,965
Speaker 8:  him. Lovely setup. Did a, I don't know

601
00:33:26,995 --> 00:33:30,925
Speaker 8:  what, maybe five minutes or so just kind of riff on his

602
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:34,525
Speaker 8:  experience with the Vision Pro, how he feels about the Quest three compared

603
00:33:34,525 --> 00:33:36,725
Speaker 8:  to the Vision Pro. 'cause there were a lot of people remember when this came

604
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:40,205
Speaker 8:  out who were like, oh, the Quest is dead. Meta actually

605
00:33:40,305 --> 00:33:43,525
Speaker 8:  rushed to launch the Quest three ahead of the Vision Pro.

606
00:33:43,975 --> 00:33:46,845
Speaker 8:  These two things have been very closely pitted against each other as sort

607
00:33:46,845 --> 00:33:50,645
Speaker 8:  of opposite ends of this strategy for a very long time. And

608
00:33:51,105 --> 00:33:55,045
Speaker 8:  he sat down and, and basically we should just play a clip here, but he

609
00:33:55,045 --> 00:33:58,325
Speaker 8:  basically said at the end of his experience, he thinks not only is the Quest

610
00:33:58,325 --> 00:34:01,605
Speaker 8:  three a better value, he thinks it is straight up a better product than the

611
00:34:01,605 --> 00:34:02,565
Speaker 8:  Vision pro. Yeah.

612
00:34:02,795 --> 00:34:06,005
Speaker 7:  Pull over in your car and just look at this man's hair and then listen to

613
00:34:06,005 --> 00:34:06,325
Speaker 7:  his voice.

614
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:10,445
Speaker 9:  I think the Quest is the better product period. And you know, the different

615
00:34:10,645 --> 00:34:13,405
Speaker 9:  companies made different design decisions for the headsets. They have different

616
00:34:13,565 --> 00:34:17,445
Speaker 9:  strengths, but overall Quest is better for the vast

617
00:34:17,725 --> 00:34:20,285
Speaker 9:  majority of things that people use mixed reality for.

618
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:23,525
Speaker 7:  And that's a good line. Right. Beautiful hair too. It's great.

619
00:34:24,905 --> 00:34:28,245
Speaker 7:  It it is look illustrious. That's what punching other men in the face will

620
00:34:28,245 --> 00:34:28,485
Speaker 7:  get. You

621
00:34:30,075 --> 00:34:33,805
Speaker 7:  just gets the, the follicles going. Yeah. He's just rocking healthier than

622
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:37,325
Speaker 7:  ever. By the way, do you know mixed martial arts is listed in Meta as risk

623
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:41,085
Speaker 7:  factors with investors? Yes. Our so good. Our CEO made made

624
00:34:41,085 --> 00:34:44,445
Speaker 7:  deeply injure himself fighting other humans. Very good. Anyway, so

625
00:34:44,985 --> 00:34:48,645
Speaker 7:  the point there, right, is everyone thought, okay, could, does

626
00:34:48,645 --> 00:34:52,565
Speaker 7:  $500 get me 85% of a Vision Pro And? honestly,

627
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:55,805
Speaker 7:  in the review, we didn't talk about the Quest a lot in our review

628
00:34:56,605 --> 00:34:58,925
Speaker 7:  'cause they, they feel very different. Yeah.

629
00:34:59,195 --> 00:34:59,485
Speaker 8:  Yeah.

630
00:34:59,825 --> 00:35:02,685
Speaker 7:  And I think now what Zuckerberg is trying to do is actually make them more

631
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:03,845
Speaker 7:  competitors. So

632
00:35:04,245 --> 00:35:06,685
Speaker 8:  I don't even know if I agree with that. I think You don't, part of his take

633
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:10,245
Speaker 8:  I think is that they're actually very different things

634
00:35:10,515 --> 00:35:14,485
Speaker 8:  that everybody wants them to be trying to do the same thing and

635
00:35:14,485 --> 00:35:17,885
Speaker 8:  sort of compete on what they can do for different people. And it's like,

636
00:35:17,885 --> 00:35:21,205
Speaker 8:  oh, I wanna do X, Y and Z. Should I buy a Quest or a Vision Pro? And his

637
00:35:21,205 --> 00:35:25,005
Speaker 8:  whole point is kind of, you can't do any of that stuff on the Vision

638
00:35:25,065 --> 00:35:25,285
Speaker 8:  Pro,

639
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,005
Speaker 7:  Like the,

640
00:35:27,145 --> 00:35:30,405
Speaker 8:  The Quest. And I will say the single funniest thing about this whole video

641
00:35:30,425 --> 00:35:34,285
Speaker 8:  to me was the moment where the camera flips around and

642
00:35:34,285 --> 00:35:37,925
Speaker 8:  it becomes clear that he's filming this thing on a Quest three.

643
00:35:37,995 --> 00:35:41,365
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Which just means there is a person sitting there very still

644
00:35:41,995 --> 00:35:44,965
Speaker 8:  just staring at him with the headset on. Just

645
00:35:44,965 --> 00:35:46,845
Speaker 7:  Like you do with the Vision Pro at your child's birthday party.

646
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:50,605
Speaker 8:  Yeah, exactly. Like next time we make a video NELI, I'm just gonna stare

647
00:35:50,605 --> 00:35:54,565
Speaker 8:  into your eyes the whole time. It's gonna be incredible. But he,

648
00:35:54,595 --> 00:35:57,365
Speaker 8:  it's, it's a big part of what he talks about and I think is the most compelling

649
00:35:57,365 --> 00:36:01,245
Speaker 8:  part of Zuckerberg's case here is that for all the stuff people

650
00:36:01,645 --> 00:36:05,565
Speaker 8:  actually want to do in a headset like this right now, we can talk

651
00:36:05,565 --> 00:36:08,765
Speaker 8:  about 10 years from now, we can talk about the big far future of headsets

652
00:36:08,765 --> 00:36:11,565
Speaker 8:  for everybody. But in terms of like right now what people wanna do inside

653
00:36:11,565 --> 00:36:14,765
Speaker 8:  of a headset, there's just more of that in the Quest.

654
00:36:14,835 --> 00:36:18,365
Speaker 7:  Yeah. There's more games, there's more apps. There are, there is. You can

655
00:36:18,365 --> 00:36:21,805
Speaker 7:  do three Mac Windows If, you want to, although setting that up

656
00:36:22,225 --> 00:36:26,125
Speaker 7:  is a Byzantine nightmare of so like what I call

657
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:29,525
Speaker 7:  software dongles. Oh yeah. You don't want, it's not great. You have to

658
00:36:29,725 --> 00:36:33,285
Speaker 8:  Download a bunch of apps that just sound like malware in order like it's

659
00:36:33,285 --> 00:36:33,445
Speaker 8:  bad.

660
00:36:33,715 --> 00:36:37,565
Speaker 7:  Yeah. The and and you're like, I'm, so I'm sending my entire screen to Meta.

661
00:36:38,785 --> 00:36:42,765
Speaker 7:  No thank you sir. I don't care what your hair looks like today. No.

662
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:46,645
Speaker 7:  So you're not actually sending your entire screen to Meta. But you understand

663
00:36:46,645 --> 00:36:50,605
Speaker 7:  what I'm saying. It's a nightmare of weird applications and

664
00:36:50,915 --> 00:36:54,525
Speaker 7:  Mark actually calls it out like their eco Apple's ecosystem is great, but

665
00:36:54,525 --> 00:36:57,365
Speaker 7:  If, you wanna play a bunch of games or you wanna do fitness If, you want

666
00:36:57,365 --> 00:37:00,845
Speaker 7:  to control the thing. You have high resolution controllers, which he's calls

667
00:37:00,865 --> 00:37:03,805
Speaker 7:  out very specifically and the heart of what he's getting at. And I think

668
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:07,685
Speaker 7:  this is really interesting because you rarely see CEOs

669
00:37:07,685 --> 00:37:11,605
Speaker 7:  acknowledge this. He's like, we made different tradeoffs than Apple.

670
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:15,965
Speaker 7:  Yep. And we think our tradeoffs make a better

671
00:37:15,965 --> 00:37:19,805
Speaker 7:  product period. Not just a cheaper product, not just a better product

672
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:23,565
Speaker 7:  at our price point. And I, he comes back to that over and over again and

673
00:37:23,565 --> 00:37:27,285
Speaker 7:  you If, you go listen to any CEO ever talk about their products.

674
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:30,965
Speaker 7:  I talked to a lot of CEOs and a lot of decoder like, you made this trade

675
00:37:30,965 --> 00:37:33,405
Speaker 7:  off, how'd you make that choice? And they're like, we didn't make any trade

676
00:37:33,405 --> 00:37:36,725
Speaker 7:  offs at all. Right. All the time. Yeah. Like all the time,

677
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:41,165
Speaker 7:  especially Apple refuses to acknowledge that they made tradeoffs. Right.

678
00:37:41,235 --> 00:37:43,485
Speaker 7:  Like in the review process we're like, why is the battery over here? And

679
00:37:43,485 --> 00:37:45,405
Speaker 7:  they're like, Hey, we wanna save wait on your head and that is as much of

680
00:37:45,405 --> 00:37:46,325
Speaker 7:  a tradeoff as you can. 'cause

681
00:37:46,325 --> 00:37:47,685
Speaker 8:  It is meant to be over here.

682
00:37:48,835 --> 00:37:49,125
Speaker 7:  It's

683
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:50,645
Speaker 8:  Like Jesus wanted it that way

684
00:37:52,185 --> 00:37:56,085
Speaker 7:  And it's like there's that one you can't avoid. But everything

685
00:37:56,085 --> 00:37:58,565
Speaker 7:  else, they're like, these are the best displays ever made. Yeah. And then

686
00:37:58,565 --> 00:38:01,485
Speaker 7:  Mark is there being like, we've looked at these displays and they are all

687
00:38:01,485 --> 00:38:03,685
Speaker 7:  lead displays and they have exactly the kind of motion blur that you would

688
00:38:03,685 --> 00:38:07,365
Speaker 7:  expect from all that displays. Our lenses are better. The, the

689
00:38:07,515 --> 00:38:10,365
Speaker 7:  Meta really believes the Quest three is pancake cleansers are better, they

690
00:38:10,365 --> 00:38:14,165
Speaker 7:  have a wider field of view. So we lose X from the displays,

691
00:38:14,165 --> 00:38:18,005
Speaker 7:  the resolution that Apple has in their displays, but we gain X in the

692
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:20,645
Speaker 7:  lenses. I'm not saying these are the right trade offs. I'm not saying these

693
00:38:20,645 --> 00:38:24,045
Speaker 7:  are trade offs that make you make you buy anything. I'm saying a CEO

694
00:38:24,045 --> 00:38:27,685
Speaker 7:  acknowledging the trade-offs in a product category is

695
00:38:28,035 --> 00:38:31,125
Speaker 7:  wild. Like fully wild. And

696
00:38:31,925 --> 00:38:35,445
Speaker 7:  I dunno, If, you saw this XA lot of people were like, this is

697
00:38:35,655 --> 00:38:38,725
Speaker 7:  Zucks Balmer moment. Oh interesting. Where Balmer was like

698
00:38:38,835 --> 00:38:42,725
Speaker 7:  $500 fully unsubsidized of the plan. I like our phone better.

699
00:38:43,785 --> 00:38:46,685
Speaker 7:  And that's, there's an element of that to what Zuck was

700
00:38:46,685 --> 00:38:50,005
Speaker 5:  Doing. Oh no, I, I, I disagree. I thought I, it felt more like a victory

701
00:38:50,145 --> 00:38:51,845
Speaker 5:  lap, like a legit victory left.

702
00:38:52,105 --> 00:38:53,085
Speaker 7:  Wow. Okay. That's how you took it.

703
00:38:53,085 --> 00:38:56,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah, because I, you know, v put up a, a story this week that I

704
00:38:56,965 --> 00:39:00,925
Speaker 5:  worked with her on about the, the visions of these two companies, because

705
00:39:00,925 --> 00:39:04,245
Speaker 5:  they're both, the end game for both of 'em isn't vr, it's ar. Right? Like

706
00:39:04,245 --> 00:39:06,845
Speaker 5:  both of these companies are waiting, eventually the technology's gonna get

707
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,365
Speaker 5:  there and they're gonna do face computers and that's what everybody wants.

708
00:39:10,095 --> 00:39:11,405
Speaker 5:  Still computing

709
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:15,605
Speaker 7:  After 15 days of the Vision Pro. Okay. Excuse me. Can we say everyone wants

710
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:15,925
Speaker 7:  a face to

711
00:39:15,925 --> 00:39:19,565
Speaker 5:  Meet? That's what everyone in Silicon Valley wants. That's what all the VCs

712
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:23,525
Speaker 5:  want. Yeah. But, but I think like their, their strategy

713
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:27,445
Speaker 5:  is a much smarter strategy. And I think when you think about how you have

714
00:39:27,445 --> 00:39:31,045
Speaker 5:  to normalize these products because they are really big, really wild and

715
00:39:31,045 --> 00:39:34,365
Speaker 5:  really insane, you have to normalize that. Like it's, it's gonna be, require

716
00:39:34,485 --> 00:39:38,245
Speaker 5:  a cultural shift. And Meta has, is moving with much smarter

717
00:39:38,245 --> 00:39:42,085
Speaker 5:  purpose in that direction than Apple who is like face computer that looks

718
00:39:42,085 --> 00:39:45,005
Speaker 5:  like ski goggles. Put it on your face. It's way too heavy and you might throw

719
00:39:45,005 --> 00:39:48,765
Speaker 5:  up, it'll be fine. And, and meta's like, okay, well we've got like these

720
00:39:48,765 --> 00:39:52,085
Speaker 5:  glasses that just look like glasses and you can't do as much, but you can

721
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:55,965
Speaker 5:  still do like, you can still like scan photos and stuff like

722
00:39:55,965 --> 00:39:59,085
Speaker 5:  that, which is really, really cool. And and they've got the VR headsets that

723
00:39:59,285 --> 00:40:03,085
Speaker 5:  actually like do vr. Well, yeah. Which like,

724
00:40:03,165 --> 00:40:06,565
Speaker 5:  I think that's just a better strategy. I I think, I think he's right. And,

725
00:40:06,565 --> 00:40:09,485
Speaker 5:  and when I was watching it, I was like, oh, this is him just taking this

726
00:40:09,485 --> 00:40:13,285
Speaker 5:  victory lap and also making some egregious

727
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:16,885
Speaker 5:  claims. Like Meta is gonna be the open ecosystem.

728
00:40:17,075 --> 00:40:17,365
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

729
00:40:17,365 --> 00:40:18,485
Speaker 8:  Which is bananas. Yeah.

730
00:40:18,485 --> 00:40:20,805
Speaker 7:  Are they gonna let Lenovo build quests? I

731
00:40:20,845 --> 00:40:23,125
Speaker 5:  I was like, I was like, oh, are you just announcing that everybody's gonna

732
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:25,645
Speaker 5:  be making headsets for, for Meta os

733
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:29,205
Speaker 7:  What they, what they mean from what I understand is that they, you can side

734
00:40:29,205 --> 00:40:30,685
Speaker 7:  load applications on a Quest. Okay.

735
00:40:30,745 --> 00:40:33,965
Speaker 8:  No. What Meta means is If, you build something cool, we'll just buy your

736
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:36,205
Speaker 8:  company. And that's, that's an open model

737
00:40:36,275 --> 00:40:38,365
Speaker 5:  That counts. Yeah. It's an open ecosystem. 'cause you get rich.

738
00:40:38,515 --> 00:40:41,845
Speaker 7:  Yeah. What they, they mean in every phase of computing there's Apple being

739
00:40:41,895 --> 00:40:45,165
Speaker 7:  weird. Yeah. And then there's everyone else being like, what if we work together?

740
00:40:45,165 --> 00:40:46,405
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And then as Apple being weird.

741
00:40:46,835 --> 00:40:50,365
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That part I was like, oh, I feel like you're like you, you had me this

742
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:53,565
Speaker 5:  whole time. Your hair looks great. You're like, you're speak, you're saying

743
00:40:53,565 --> 00:40:56,925
Speaker 5:  the things that I really do think about this whole field and now you've just

744
00:40:57,315 --> 00:40:57,605
Speaker 5:  lied.

745
00:40:58,065 --> 00:41:01,805
Speaker 7:  He does keep saying that they will be the open player in vr and it really

746
00:41:01,805 --> 00:41:02,365
Speaker 7:  unclear with

747
00:41:02,365 --> 00:41:06,245
Speaker 5:  That. I was like, I really wanna sit him down with like a computer historian

748
00:41:06,705 --> 00:41:09,765
Speaker 5:  to explain to him computer histories so that he understands that what he's

749
00:41:09,765 --> 00:41:10,485
Speaker 5:  saying is not true.

750
00:41:10,785 --> 00:41:13,405
Speaker 7:  Oh, I'm sure he has access to computer historians. He

751
00:41:13,645 --> 00:41:15,485
Speaker 5:  Probably does. He probably, but he doesn't listen. He

752
00:41:15,485 --> 00:41:18,085
Speaker 7:  Should listen. I think there's a, there's just a way of positioning yourself

753
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:21,925
Speaker 7:  up against the big bad of Apple that he's taking advantage of. But I think

754
00:41:21,925 --> 00:41:23,925
Speaker 7:  right now what they have is side loading apps. Yeah.

755
00:41:24,225 --> 00:41:27,325
Speaker 8:  But I will say also to your point Alex, I think one thing

756
00:41:28,225 --> 00:41:32,165
Speaker 8:  I'm really starting to realize is how significant Meta's

757
00:41:32,435 --> 00:41:36,085
Speaker 8:  lead is just having been at this in public for a decade.

758
00:41:36,505 --> 00:41:40,285
Speaker 8:  Yep. Because again, like Neil, I go back to the Apple watch you, you

759
00:41:40,285 --> 00:41:43,525
Speaker 8:  launch the thing and then you wait around for a couple of years for people

760
00:41:43,525 --> 00:41:46,645
Speaker 8:  to tell you what they want from it. And then it's your job to kind of chase

761
00:41:46,645 --> 00:41:49,925
Speaker 8:  that and figure it out. Right. And Apple is good at that

762
00:41:50,075 --> 00:41:53,205
Speaker 8:  generally and does it very quickly and relies on its developers to do it

763
00:41:53,205 --> 00:41:57,005
Speaker 8:  for them. Meta's been at that for 10 years now. Like the thing where

764
00:41:57,345 --> 00:41:59,885
Speaker 8:  here's a thing on your face, it's kind of ugly and you'll probably throw

765
00:41:59,885 --> 00:42:02,805
Speaker 8:  up like, you know what that sounds like is the first three Oculus products.

766
00:42:04,065 --> 00:42:07,045
Speaker 8:  That's just what it was. And it turned off a lot of people and we all, you

767
00:42:07,045 --> 00:42:10,245
Speaker 8:  know, hemmed and hot about whether a whole generation was being turned off

768
00:42:10,245 --> 00:42:14,085
Speaker 8:  by their first experience in VR because it was so bad. But now

769
00:42:14,085 --> 00:42:16,765
Speaker 8:  it's been at this long enough that it's pretty good at it and it has a pretty

770
00:42:16,765 --> 00:42:20,565
Speaker 8:  clear sense of what people want right now. And I think that's where

771
00:42:20,565 --> 00:42:23,965
Speaker 8:  things like the Meta Ray band stuff come from. It's like, oh, people want

772
00:42:24,495 --> 00:42:28,365
Speaker 8:  super immersive and that's either like gaming or the fitness stuff. They

773
00:42:28,365 --> 00:42:32,125
Speaker 8:  want to be in another world or they want as little technology as possible.

774
00:42:32,305 --> 00:42:35,205
Speaker 8:  And so it, they've pushed to both ends of that and I think are able to do

775
00:42:35,205 --> 00:42:39,085
Speaker 8:  it. Whereas Apple very much just put out a tech demo and we're like, is

776
00:42:39,085 --> 00:42:42,645
Speaker 8:  this anything? Like it's starting at that road now. Yeah. And Meta has been

777
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:43,685
Speaker 8:  on it for a long time.

778
00:42:44,245 --> 00:42:47,045
Speaker 7:  I would say that there's a, there, I think there's a little bit of a danger

779
00:42:47,045 --> 00:42:50,525
Speaker 7:  of the bomber problem. Mm. And that Apple is relentless. Yes. And they do

780
00:42:50,525 --> 00:42:53,125
Speaker 7:  stay focused. The difference The difference and they

781
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:54,565
Speaker 8:  Have all the money in the universe

782
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:58,605
Speaker 7:  Is that Mark Zuckerberg is not Steve Almer. Yes.

783
00:42:59,725 --> 00:43:03,005
Speaker 7:  I just, just an observation that I've made over time. I've studied these

784
00:43:03,005 --> 00:43:03,925
Speaker 7:  two men very carefully.

785
00:43:05,485 --> 00:43:09,005
Speaker 7:  I think Meta is more reactive to consumers and that

786
00:43:09,125 --> 00:43:12,565
Speaker 7:  bomber's, Microsoft was much more reactive to enterprise. Yeah, that's a

787
00:43:12,565 --> 00:43:14,965
Speaker 7:  hundred percent. And so, and they just, and that version of Microsoft, not

788
00:43:15,165 --> 00:43:18,245
Speaker 7:  Microsoft now, but that version of Microsoft in particular was addicted to

789
00:43:18,245 --> 00:43:22,205
Speaker 7:  making the ugliest shit possible. Yes. They're just like, it's Windows Mobile

790
00:43:22,265 --> 00:43:26,165
Speaker 7:  6.5, it's the same Windows mobile that you've hated all this

791
00:43:26,165 --> 00:43:30,045
Speaker 7:  time. But now the stock launcher is a honeycomb also that won't

792
00:43:30,045 --> 00:43:33,725
Speaker 7:  be there. And carriers can do whatever garbage they want and it's like, this

793
00:43:33,735 --> 00:43:34,605
Speaker 7:  isn't a good idea.

794
00:43:34,825 --> 00:43:36,365
Speaker 8:  We made the icon smaller.

795
00:43:37,825 --> 00:43:41,645
Speaker 7:  The worst. This is bad. Yeah. And Apple was able to, for and So I think there

796
00:43:41,645 --> 00:43:45,365
Speaker 7:  are some meaningful differences here because they have been in market with

797
00:43:45,405 --> 00:43:49,285
Speaker 7:  a complete consumer product. I'm not saying I have a Quest two I

798
00:43:49,395 --> 00:43:53,005
Speaker 7:  Yeah, you have a Quest like lots of Quest twos out there, some Quest threes,

799
00:43:53,795 --> 00:43:56,045
Speaker 7:  Apple's coming at this from a different direction. I'm not saying they won't

800
00:43:56,045 --> 00:43:58,925
Speaker 7:  succeed, but I think after two weeks with this thing

801
00:43:59,835 --> 00:44:03,765
Speaker 7:  like the, the barriers are are

802
00:44:03,765 --> 00:44:07,685
Speaker 7:  just crystal clear. Yeah. In a way that the barriers

803
00:44:07,785 --> 00:44:11,765
Speaker 7:  to the Quest are also crystal clear and I, they're gonna

804
00:44:12,005 --> 00:44:15,965
Speaker 7:  converge more than they don't. But saying like Apple revitalizes market I

805
00:44:15,965 --> 00:44:19,645
Speaker 7:  think is we can generous. Yeah. And with the watch they

806
00:44:19,845 --> 00:44:22,885
Speaker 7:  had a huge advantage, which was no one else could make a watch.

807
00:44:23,555 --> 00:44:27,445
Speaker 7:  Well no, I mean like literally like the iPhone does not allow other

808
00:44:27,445 --> 00:44:30,845
Speaker 7:  watches. Oh that's true. Yeah. You like Pebble existed and like I was just

809
00:44:30,845 --> 00:44:31,045
Speaker 7:  Yeah,

810
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,205
Speaker 10:  I was just, I was like Pebble

811
00:44:32,205 --> 00:44:34,525
Speaker 7:  Was a great walk. No, but if If, you wanna do the thing where like you get

812
00:44:34,525 --> 00:44:37,725
Speaker 7:  a text message and you just respond. Yes. Like Pebble was not allowed to

813
00:44:37,725 --> 00:44:41,085
Speaker 7:  do that. Yeah. You'd be like, oh okay, lemme pull my phone out. So we'll

814
00:44:41,085 --> 00:44:43,445
Speaker 7:  see. Is there anything else I wanna

815
00:44:43,445 --> 00:44:46,285
Speaker 8:  Say? No, we've talked enough about the Vision Pro. I like that we just spent

816
00:44:46,285 --> 00:44:49,325
Speaker 8:  40 minutes being like, everybody's returning this product. Let's talk about

817
00:44:49,525 --> 00:44:53,365
Speaker 7:  It. Oh, I did. It is the most fascinating product. It is Apple's first big

818
00:44:53,385 --> 00:44:57,205
Speaker 7:  bet. I wanna talk about it. I just want to end on this. I want

819
00:44:57,365 --> 00:45:00,885
Speaker 7:  everyone to do this homework and send me your evaluation. We've talked a

820
00:45:00,885 --> 00:45:03,565
Speaker 7:  lot about my theory of wearable bullshit,

821
00:45:05,405 --> 00:45:09,325
Speaker 7:  whatever that is. Where the chart is value on one axis

822
00:45:09,905 --> 00:45:13,845
Speaker 7:  and then like fiddly ness. Yeah. And then a 10 x multiplier

823
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:17,645
Speaker 7:  if it's on your face. That's as far as I've gotten on this. So an Apple

824
00:45:17,645 --> 00:45:21,165
Speaker 7:  Watch started really fiddly with not a lot of value. Eventually crossed the

825
00:45:21,165 --> 00:45:25,105
Speaker 7:  line and now people really like Apple watches. We all

826
00:45:25,105 --> 00:45:28,905
Speaker 7:  have one. Yeah. AirPods not very fiddly at all. Super

827
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:32,835
Speaker 7:  valuable. People really like 'em. Face computers historically

828
00:45:32,925 --> 00:45:36,675
Speaker 7:  below the line. Very fiddly, enormous social

829
00:45:36,825 --> 00:45:40,595
Speaker 7:  cost. Not a lot of value. Yeah. Where do you think the Vision

830
00:45:40,615 --> 00:45:44,515
Speaker 7:  Pro is on the graph? Send me your graph. We will, we will just go through

831
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:48,035
Speaker 7:  'em. I'm dying to know what you all think after this. It's gonna be because

832
00:45:48,035 --> 00:45:48,395
Speaker 7:  that's

833
00:45:50,225 --> 00:45:54,195
Speaker 7:  fids. No, it's a value on the, the values on the

834
00:45:54,195 --> 00:45:58,035
Speaker 7:  Y axis. Fids on the X and then

835
00:45:58,115 --> 00:46:02,035
Speaker 7:  a 10 x multiplier for on your face. That's it. Those

836
00:46:02,035 --> 00:46:05,195
Speaker 7:  are, that's what I think it is. There's an entire episode where we go through

837
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:09,035
Speaker 7:  this. So I'm just, you go back and look at that one. If, you want more versions

838
00:46:09,035 --> 00:46:12,635
Speaker 7:  of the graph, but just send me your graphs. I, I'm dying to know what you

839
00:46:12,635 --> 00:46:15,555
Speaker 7:  think about the theory of wearable bullshit as applied to vision Credit.

840
00:46:15,555 --> 00:46:17,915
Speaker 7:  Alright, we have to take a break. We'll be right back.

841
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:15,105
Speaker 12:  safely.

842
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:24,555
Speaker 7:  We're back as we've been recording Vamping

843
00:48:24,695 --> 00:48:28,195
Speaker 7:  to fill time with the Vision Pro. Microsoft has been

844
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:31,995
Speaker 7:  quietly making announcements in the background on a, on a podcast, I believe.

845
00:48:32,095 --> 00:48:32,315
Speaker 7:  Yes.

846
00:48:32,455 --> 00:48:34,395
Speaker 8:  The weirdest way ever to announce things.

847
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:38,035
Speaker 7:  We've been recording a podcast while they have been publishing a podcast

848
00:48:38,335 --> 00:48:41,075
Speaker 7:  and now our podcast will be about what they said on their podcast.

849
00:48:41,545 --> 00:48:44,955
Speaker 8:  Does it, do we now directly compete with the Xbox? Yes.

850
00:48:46,155 --> 00:48:47,555
Speaker 5:  Download ours. Don't, don't download the Xbox.

851
00:48:47,585 --> 00:48:50,675
Speaker 7:  Phil Spencer just went on a podcast and said everything The Verge said is

852
00:48:50,675 --> 00:48:54,315
Speaker 7:  true and always has been. All right. Alex,

853
00:48:54,425 --> 00:48:55,755
Speaker 7:  what is going on in the news over there?

854
00:48:55,945 --> 00:48:59,915
Speaker 5:  Okay, so there's been rumors for the last few weeks that Microsoft

855
00:48:59,935 --> 00:49:03,875
Speaker 5:  was gonna take a couple of games and that are exclusive for

856
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:07,835
Speaker 5:  the Xbox and make them not exclusive, put 'em on the switch, put 'em on the

857
00:49:07,855 --> 00:49:10,595
Speaker 5:  PS five fans. Were not pleased about that.

858
00:49:10,855 --> 00:49:13,595
Speaker 8:  Can you explain that to me? Actually, I have realized in all of this chaos

859
00:49:13,665 --> 00:49:17,355
Speaker 8:  that I don't understand why people would be so up in arms about that. Well

860
00:49:17,555 --> 00:49:21,395
Speaker 5:  I think If, you go and you spend a lot of money on a product and you invest

861
00:49:21,475 --> 00:49:25,235
Speaker 5:  a lot of time and energy into it and like buying a lot of games for it and

862
00:49:25,235 --> 00:49:29,115
Speaker 5:  then, and you're like, yeah, I don't get like the last of us and

863
00:49:29,115 --> 00:49:32,355
Speaker 5:  I don't get Horizon zero dawn and I don't get all these cool PS five games,

864
00:49:32,455 --> 00:49:36,395
Speaker 5:  but I get, was it Starfield? And, and I get see of Thieves

865
00:49:36,855 --> 00:49:40,595
Speaker 5:  and then they say, okay, now Starfield is gonna go off and be

866
00:49:41,095 --> 00:49:44,945
Speaker 5:  on on PS five. I would probably like, I'd probably

867
00:49:44,945 --> 00:49:45,625
Speaker 5:  be a little miffed.

868
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:48,385
Speaker 8:  So you're like, maybe I should have just bought a PlayStation and now I get

869
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:48,505
Speaker 8:  all

870
00:49:48,505 --> 00:49:51,105
Speaker 5:  The games. Right? Like, why did I even buy an Xbox to begin with? Okay, I

871
00:49:51,105 --> 00:49:54,465
Speaker 5:  get that. 'cause they're like five, $600. That's expensive. So Starfield

872
00:49:54,465 --> 00:49:58,425
Speaker 5:  is not coming to the PS five. But see Thieves Grounded. Hi-Fi

873
00:49:58,425 --> 00:50:01,505
Speaker 5:  Rush and Intimate are coming to the PS five and the Switch

874
00:50:02,635 --> 00:50:06,425
Speaker 5:  first. Hi-Fi Rush and Intimate. Then see if Thieves and Grounded,

875
00:50:06,485 --> 00:50:10,345
Speaker 5:  see if Thieves is like a really pretty popular Xbox game where you can

876
00:50:10,345 --> 00:50:13,625
Speaker 5:  like be a pirate and you go play with other pirates. It's cute, it's fun.

877
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:16,905
Speaker 5:  It's a big, like it's almost an M-O-R-P-G but not quite.

878
00:50:17,795 --> 00:50:21,065
Speaker 5:  These are, these are pretty popular games for Xbox and now they're gonna

879
00:50:21,065 --> 00:50:25,025
Speaker 5:  be on PS five and Nintendo Switch

880
00:50:25,085 --> 00:50:25,465
Speaker 5:  and it's

881
00:50:25,465 --> 00:50:27,300
Speaker 7:  Can Wait, can I just say something about this? Yeah.

882
00:50:28,915 --> 00:50:32,235
Speaker 7:  Microsoft has not actually officially confirmed those four games. What

883
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:33,795
Speaker 7:  Tom,

884
00:50:34,375 --> 00:50:34,955
Speaker 5:  Tom has Con

885
00:50:35,055 --> 00:50:39,035
Speaker 7:  Has reported and knows that it's those four games. Yeah, but Microsoft won't

886
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:40,075
Speaker 7:  confirm that those are the

887
00:50:40,075 --> 00:50:43,355
Speaker 5:  Four. So weird. They're just saying four games, but they are not, they, they've

888
00:50:43,355 --> 00:50:46,955
Speaker 5:  pretty clearly said it's not gonna be Starfield and it's not

889
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:50,715
Speaker 5:  gonna be the rumor at Indiana Jones video game that's

890
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:52,555
Speaker 8:  Coming out. So it's not any of the big games.

891
00:50:54,475 --> 00:50:58,115
Speaker 8:  I mean like real like, yeah Microsoft, Microsoft is a handful of like

892
00:50:58,515 --> 00:51:01,835
Speaker 8:  gigantic things in its arsenal now. And none of the games you just named

893
00:51:01,935 --> 00:51:03,115
Speaker 8:  are those games. Yes. Like

894
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:07,435
Speaker 5:  Xbox fans, please don't come for me, but, but if you're not like a big

895
00:51:07,675 --> 00:51:10,675
Speaker 5:  hardcore Xbox fans, these are are probably not the biggest games in the world.

896
00:51:10,825 --> 00:51:14,555
Speaker 5:  It's, it's no nowhere compared nothing compared to like the last of Us are

897
00:51:14,555 --> 00:51:17,475
Speaker 5:  Uncharted or some of PlayStations exclusives.

898
00:51:17,615 --> 00:51:21,555
Speaker 7:  I'm horrible at video games and all of these sound like fun names for

899
00:51:21,555 --> 00:51:24,475
Speaker 7:  Thieves and a comic book. Yeah. I'm Penman

900
00:51:25,775 --> 00:51:26,955
Speaker 7:  I'm a Sea of Thieves. Like,

901
00:51:27,385 --> 00:51:29,835
Speaker 8:  Like Rejected Musketeers. Yeah, exactly.

902
00:51:32,815 --> 00:51:34,435
Speaker 7:  Oh no, it's HiFi Rush. Like,

903
00:51:35,615 --> 00:51:39,155
Speaker 5:  But it's, it's, this was like a, this has been a big deal for the community.

904
00:51:39,575 --> 00:51:43,155
Speaker 5:  Tom actually got to talk with Phil Spencer about it. There was a big interview

905
00:51:43,575 --> 00:51:47,235
Speaker 5:  and I've definitely been maybe editing

906
00:51:47,345 --> 00:51:50,755
Speaker 5:  that, that little idea, looking at that stuff I maybe I maybe knew a little

907
00:51:50,755 --> 00:51:54,115
Speaker 5:  ahead of the podcast what was, what was coming or not coming

908
00:51:54,395 --> 00:51:58,355
Speaker 5:  spoilers. And I thought what was really interesting was

909
00:51:58,495 --> 00:52:02,235
Speaker 5:  he was very evasive in in the interview with us about like what games were

910
00:52:02,235 --> 00:52:04,675
Speaker 5:  coming and what games weren't coming. He wasn't really commit to anything.

911
00:52:05,615 --> 00:52:08,795
Speaker 5:  He, and when asked specifically about Starfield and Indiana Jones, which

912
00:52:08,795 --> 00:52:12,395
Speaker 5:  are the ones I think fans are most concerned about losing that,

913
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:16,475
Speaker 5:  that access to or losing that exclusive access to. He said,

914
00:52:16,735 --> 00:52:20,715
Speaker 5:  you know, I don't think we should as an industry ever rule out a game

915
00:52:20,715 --> 00:52:23,235
Speaker 5:  going to any other platform which is,

916
00:52:24,805 --> 00:52:28,545
Speaker 5:  you know, If, you just wanna be able to play any game like you NELI who's

917
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:31,345
Speaker 5:  bad at games and probably doesn't wanna own every system. That's great news

918
00:52:31,345 --> 00:52:34,545
Speaker 5:  for you. If you're really invested in one ecosystem that's less great news

919
00:52:34,775 --> 00:52:37,145
Speaker 5:  because like the console Wars. Yeah.

920
00:52:37,485 --> 00:52:41,465
Speaker 7:  So a really interesting thing here that I am hoping you can explain

921
00:52:41,465 --> 00:52:45,345
Speaker 7:  to me. I have for years now assumed

922
00:52:45,615 --> 00:52:49,305
Speaker 7:  that the Microsoft strategy is game streaming.

923
00:52:49,445 --> 00:52:53,265
Speaker 7:  Yes. Right. They're slowly moving to Xbox game streaming. They bought

924
00:52:53,315 --> 00:52:57,065
Speaker 7:  Activision, they, they want to be everywhere.

925
00:52:57,645 --> 00:53:01,585
Speaker 7:  And Phil Spencer has said to me like, we are bad. We are,

926
00:53:01,585 --> 00:53:05,025
Speaker 7:  we're the number three player in video games and The future in consoles.

927
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:09,105
Speaker 7:  In consoles and If. you look broadly, all the action is on phones and

928
00:53:09,105 --> 00:53:12,185
Speaker 7:  we gotta go there. Yeah. And it has always felt like a hint of we're gonna

929
00:53:12,185 --> 00:53:15,785
Speaker 7:  go do game streaming now there's the Digital Markets Act. Apple

930
00:53:16,005 --> 00:53:19,105
Speaker 7:  has to open up different stores. Apple has said they're gonna allow game

931
00:53:19,105 --> 00:53:23,025
Speaker 7:  streaming. So you look at this shift and it is not that

932
00:53:23,025 --> 00:53:27,005
Speaker 7:  they're not putting Xbox Game Pass on the PS five.

933
00:53:27,375 --> 00:53:30,925
Speaker 7:  Right. They're just porting four titles to the PS five.

934
00:53:31,155 --> 00:53:33,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And people were that upset about it, but

935
00:53:33,865 --> 00:53:36,805
Speaker 7:  That's the part that I don't get. It's like why that's a lot of work.

936
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:41,245
Speaker 7:  Like isn't the point that we're gonna stream the titles over there?

937
00:53:41,515 --> 00:53:41,805
Speaker 7:  It's

938
00:53:41,825 --> 00:53:45,445
Speaker 5:  Not like, given that the architecture of these consoles now Yeah. It's not

939
00:53:45,445 --> 00:53:48,045
Speaker 5:  as hard of work as it used to be because they both run on the same like a

940
00:53:48,165 --> 00:53:52,125
Speaker 5:  MD kind of architecture. It's it's different enough that it's like, it's

941
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:54,645
Speaker 5:  not like just point and click Sure. And you immediately transfer, but, but

942
00:53:54,645 --> 00:53:58,125
Speaker 5:  it's not as hard as it used to be. I think this is all kind of part of showing

943
00:53:58,125 --> 00:54:00,285
Speaker 5:  that they're friendly and that they're not going to

944
00:54:01,825 --> 00:54:05,725
Speaker 5:  create a monopoly in gaming. Because right now they, they

945
00:54:05,725 --> 00:54:08,165
Speaker 5:  own Activision Blizzard, which was like one of the largest game companies.

946
00:54:08,195 --> 00:54:11,445
Speaker 5:  They are effectively one of the largest game companies in the world right

947
00:54:11,445 --> 00:54:14,565
Speaker 5:  now. Right, right. Like I think Tencent, maybe Nintendo are the only thing

948
00:54:14,565 --> 00:54:18,365
Speaker 5:  that might even come close to them. So just absolutely enormous.

949
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:22,485
Speaker 5:  And if they wanna say, okay, no more Call of Duty on PS five in 10

950
00:54:22,485 --> 00:54:24,645
Speaker 5:  years, they can do that. So this

951
00:54:24,865 --> 00:54:28,445
Speaker 7:  No, but they ran around the world Right. Promising any government official

952
00:54:28,555 --> 00:54:31,605
Speaker 7:  Yeah. That they would ship Call of Duty for at least five more years. Right.

953
00:54:31,605 --> 00:54:31,765
Speaker 7:  Like

954
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:35,725
Speaker 5:  10, 10 10. Yeah. So, so they're like committed for the next 10 years stuff.

955
00:54:35,725 --> 00:54:35,765
Speaker 5:  I

956
00:54:35,765 --> 00:54:38,885
Speaker 7:  Mean they're like futile lords in European countries you've never heard of

957
00:54:39,005 --> 00:54:41,245
Speaker 7:  that have secured a 10 year commitment for Call of Duty

958
00:54:42,225 --> 00:54:45,085
Speaker 5:  And they're trying and like a futile lord. They're trying to show how magnanimous

959
00:54:45,085 --> 00:54:47,965
Speaker 5:  they're right. They're trying to show. Yeah. Yeah. We, we we got you. We

960
00:54:47,965 --> 00:54:51,485
Speaker 5:  wanna be everywhere all at once. But we also don't wanna destroy all of our

961
00:54:51,485 --> 00:54:54,765
Speaker 5:  competition because we need them to sell games. Oh

962
00:54:54,765 --> 00:54:58,725
Speaker 8:  Man. That is so charitable and so wrong. Yeah. Oh

963
00:54:58,745 --> 00:54:58,965
Speaker 8:  man.

964
00:54:59,775 --> 00:55:00,845
Speaker 5:  Where do you, what's your read on it?

965
00:55:01,105 --> 00:55:04,405
Speaker 8:  So we we should It's, I you're probably right, honestly, but don don't know.

966
00:55:04,705 --> 00:55:08,645
Speaker 8:  We should, we should cut off here because I think we're gonna have Tom

967
00:55:08,645 --> 00:55:11,885
Speaker 8:  on the show on Tuesday. That's true. Who knows clearly more about what's

968
00:55:11,885 --> 00:55:15,005
Speaker 8:  going on than anyone at Microsoft. So Tom's going to explain what's going

969
00:55:15,005 --> 00:55:18,805
Speaker 8:  on here. But NELI, I would just point you to the Xbox

970
00:55:18,945 --> 00:55:22,885
Speaker 8:  one and the thing where Microsoft said, Hey, here's a console that plays

971
00:55:22,885 --> 00:55:26,845
Speaker 8:  all of your games, but we're doing it in a slightly new way. And also a different

972
00:55:26,845 --> 00:55:30,365
Speaker 8:  thing happens when you turn on your TV and gamers just about

973
00:55:30,505 --> 00:55:34,445
Speaker 8:  burned the buildings down at Microsoft. Yeah. Like this business is

974
00:55:34,985 --> 00:55:38,685
Speaker 8:  too big to screw up. And if you're Microsoft and you're out here

975
00:55:38,745 --> 00:55:42,725
Speaker 8:  saying, game streaming is The future, we're, we're moving these three games

976
00:55:42,725 --> 00:55:46,445
Speaker 8:  you've never heard of and see of Thieves over. And people lose their

977
00:55:46,695 --> 00:55:50,445
Speaker 8:  minds like Microsoft is going to play this the

978
00:55:50,515 --> 00:55:54,245
Speaker 8:  slowest possible way because it is desperately afraid of losing

979
00:55:54,795 --> 00:55:58,645
Speaker 8:  this little bit of love that it has in the gaming community. Like

980
00:55:58,685 --> 00:56:01,525
Speaker 8:  I, I do actually agree with Alex that there are some reasons to be worried

981
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:05,165
Speaker 8:  about the antitrust ramifications of just running roughshod over the gaming

982
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:08,045
Speaker 8:  industry, which in theory Microsoft could afford to do, but also

983
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:13,045
Speaker 8:  pissing off gamers goes real bad for everybody and Microsoft knows that better

984
00:56:13,045 --> 00:56:16,805
Speaker 8:  than anybody. Yeah. And so it is, it is going to take this the slowest. Yeah.

985
00:56:16,805 --> 00:56:18,725
Speaker 8:  It feels like it can afford to take this

986
00:56:19,085 --> 00:56:22,045
Speaker 5:  I think, which is why there's a lot of rumors. We, we wrote a piece this

987
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:25,445
Speaker 5:  week, like Tom really thinks a handheld is coming. He'll talk more about

988
00:56:25,445 --> 00:56:29,325
Speaker 5:  it with David on next week. Sean also fully

989
00:56:29,655 --> 00:56:33,485
Speaker 5:  wants, he wants to manifest a handheld that's like a steam

990
00:56:33,485 --> 00:56:36,925
Speaker 5:  deck with Xbox built in. Like, I am rooting for Sean. 'cause I think that'll

991
00:56:36,925 --> 00:56:40,285
Speaker 5:  be cool too. But they, they did tease some like unique hardware coming. They've,

992
00:56:40,285 --> 00:56:42,885
Speaker 5:  they've teased some bigger hardware is coming down the line. Phil

993
00:56:42,885 --> 00:56:44,205
Speaker 7:  Spencer keeps liking tweets about

994
00:56:44,475 --> 00:56:48,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah. He keeps liking tweets about handhelds and they ke in, in this

995
00:56:48,285 --> 00:56:52,245
Speaker 5:  conversation he had with Tom, he said, yes, unique stuff's coming. So like

996
00:56:52,485 --> 00:56:53,725
Speaker 8:  A handheld is coming like

997
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:57,525
Speaker 5:  Yeah, a hand held is coming. Is it gonna be like a good handheld or is it

998
00:56:57,525 --> 00:57:01,245
Speaker 5:  gonna be more like what? Sony like farted out. We'll see.

999
00:57:02,305 --> 00:57:03,245
Speaker 5:  All right. Yeah, sorry.

1000
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:06,885
Speaker 7:  We'll come back. Tom will be on the show. We'll unpack all of it. Yeah.

1001
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:11,565
Speaker 7:  I'm legitimately confused about why

1002
00:57:11,675 --> 00:57:13,725
Speaker 7:  Port four games to another console.

1003
00:57:14,025 --> 00:57:15,085
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna like If you we're

1004
00:57:15,085 --> 00:57:17,325
Speaker 7:  Gonna, your strategy is to be everywhere and the problem is phones, we're

1005
00:57:17,325 --> 00:57:17,405
Speaker 7:  gonna

1006
00:57:17,405 --> 00:57:21,165
Speaker 5:  Throw you into the Xbox like Reddit and just, I think the

1007
00:57:21,165 --> 00:57:22,285
Speaker 5:  confusion will go

1008
00:57:22,285 --> 00:57:24,045
Speaker 8:  Away. Can I, can I interest you in gamers?

1009
00:57:26,345 --> 00:57:27,845
Speaker 7:  Oh no, it's Hi-Fi rush. Okay.

1010
00:57:31,235 --> 00:57:33,885
Speaker 5:  They were mainly con confirmed. I think they were more concerned about Starfield,

1011
00:57:33,885 --> 00:57:37,005
Speaker 5:  which it sounds like is not gonna be in this initial run. So to be fair,

1012
00:57:37,005 --> 00:57:40,005
Speaker 5:  that was the one they were really passionate about. 'cause it just came out.

1013
00:57:40,075 --> 00:57:41,365
Speaker 5:  They're like, don't do this like this.

1014
00:57:41,665 --> 00:57:45,565
Speaker 8:  But I would bet you $10 that if Microsoft had its druthers and was

1015
00:57:45,565 --> 00:57:48,285
Speaker 8:  not afraid of the ramifications, Starfield would be in this.

1016
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:49,445
Speaker 5:  Oh a hundred percent.

1017
00:57:49,595 --> 00:57:53,405
Speaker 8:  Like Microsoft's strategy includes Starfield and Indiana Jones

1018
00:57:53,405 --> 00:57:55,725
Speaker 8:  being available everywhere. Yeah, it just does.

1019
00:57:56,555 --> 00:57:59,525
Speaker 5:  It's coming. It's just, they're gonna be like six months from now they'll

1020
00:57:59,525 --> 00:58:01,005
Speaker 5:  be like, oh, it came out. Don't worry about it.

1021
00:58:01,015 --> 00:58:04,965
Speaker 8:  Don't worry. Yeah. Phil Spencer is just like quiet quietly tiptoeing

1022
00:58:05,305 --> 00:58:09,285
Speaker 8:  in slippers towards The future that he's promising. Like that's, that's

1023
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:09,805
Speaker 8:  where we're at here.

1024
00:58:10,275 --> 00:58:11,765
Speaker 5:  High up on the tip piece. Exactly.

1025
00:58:11,985 --> 00:58:12,445
Speaker 8:  Oh my

1026
00:58:12,445 --> 00:58:12,565
Speaker 7:  God.

1027
00:58:13,635 --> 00:58:14,605
Speaker 5:  High heels on the tip.

1028
00:58:14,745 --> 00:58:15,325
Speaker 7:  Yep. Yep. I know.

1029
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:18,365
Speaker 5:  There we go. I said it all the way to work today's That's how I walked to

1030
00:58:18,515 --> 00:58:20,365
Speaker 7:  Work. It's the next line. That's the real problem. I'm

1031
00:58:20,365 --> 00:58:20,485
Speaker 5:  Not gonna

1032
00:58:20,485 --> 00:58:21,405
Speaker 8:  Finish it. Let's just move on.

1033
00:58:22,095 --> 00:58:24,125
Speaker 5:  We're good. We're good here. I love TikTok.

1034
00:58:24,905 --> 00:58:28,765
Speaker 7:  All right. That's, that's Microsoft. And again, Tom will be on the show and

1035
00:58:29,215 --> 00:58:32,935
Speaker 7:  we'll, we'll try to figure out what all this means. We should talk about

1036
00:58:33,075 --> 00:58:36,975
Speaker 7:  AI briefly before our lightning round. By the way, two more people have asked

1037
00:58:36,975 --> 00:58:39,975
Speaker 7:  me how to sponsor Lightning Round and the answer is that for all my jokes

1038
00:58:40,465 --> 00:58:43,615
Speaker 7:  about taking your money, that's not my job. I don't know how,

1039
00:58:44,555 --> 00:58:45,615
Speaker 7:  that's not what we do here.

1040
00:58:45,765 --> 00:58:46,615
Speaker 5:  Just Venmo in

1041
00:58:46,795 --> 00:58:50,735
Speaker 7:  The influencers know how to take money. They, but we are, we just

1042
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:54,575
Speaker 7:  do disclosures and other people take the money. So we'll figure it out.

1043
00:58:54,655 --> 00:58:57,695
Speaker 7:  I promise someone else is gonna take your money. But we talk about AI quickly

1044
00:58:57,695 --> 00:58:58,535
Speaker 7:  and then do a lightning round.

1045
00:59:00,235 --> 00:59:04,215
Speaker 7:  We mentioned at the top of the show that Google's strategy is very much we

1046
00:59:04,215 --> 00:59:08,135
Speaker 7:  hope over time this makes sense. I would say that my understanding of

1047
00:59:08,235 --> 00:59:12,015
Speaker 7:  the Gemini product roadmap right now fits perfectly

1048
00:59:12,285 --> 00:59:16,055
Speaker 7:  into over time. We hope this makes sense because they

1049
00:59:16,055 --> 00:59:20,015
Speaker 7:  announced Gemini Ultra, which is 20 bucks a month. And then David you

1050
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:23,845
Speaker 7:  just wrote about Gemini 1.5 Pro, which they're like

1051
00:59:23,985 --> 00:59:27,925
Speaker 7:  is as good as Gemini Ultra. What it's, it's fantastic. What is going

1052
00:59:27,925 --> 00:59:28,205
Speaker 7:  on here?

1053
00:59:28,505 --> 00:59:32,485
Speaker 8:  So Google, in case you've wondered if Google is good at

1054
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:35,445
Speaker 8:  naming things now because they decided to name everything Gemini and that

1055
00:59:35,445 --> 00:59:39,405
Speaker 8:  seemed like it made sense. Don't worry my friends Google still sucks

1056
00:59:39,445 --> 00:59:43,205
Speaker 8:  at naming stuff. There are I think four

1057
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:46,925
Speaker 8:  different product names between the Gemini product

1058
00:59:46,995 --> 00:59:50,805
Speaker 8:  that you use and the Gemini subscription that you pay for. There are four

1059
00:59:50,805 --> 00:59:53,245
Speaker 8:  different product names, but at any rate, so

1060
00:59:55,065 --> 00:59:58,765
Speaker 8:  Gemini 1.5 is basically Google's new next

1061
00:59:59,015 --> 01:00:02,725
Speaker 8:  model. It makes sense. Everybody's always working on these next models.

1062
01:00:03,805 --> 01:00:07,725
Speaker 8:  I was talking to Sun their CEO about this yesterday and one of the things

1063
01:00:07,725 --> 01:00:11,525
Speaker 8:  that he told me was he thinks that over time eventually these numbers

1064
01:00:11,575 --> 01:00:14,165
Speaker 8:  won't matter to people and all of this stuff will just sort of happen in

1065
01:00:14,165 --> 01:00:17,725
Speaker 8:  the background. He compared it to Google search where like search doesn't

1066
01:00:17,985 --> 01:00:20,925
Speaker 8:  get new version names. It just kind of gets better over time. I

1067
01:00:20,925 --> 01:00:24,765
Speaker 7:  Wanna point out that Sam Altman said that a million times before announcing

1068
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:26,725
Speaker 7:  GBT four, just saying

1069
01:00:26,925 --> 01:00:30,645
Speaker 8:  Oh sure. And there's 3.5 and there's 3.5 Turbo and there's GPT-4 and now

1070
01:00:30,725 --> 01:00:33,085
Speaker 8:  GPT five is apparently a thing even that he said it wouldn't matter. Like

1071
01:00:33,665 --> 01:00:37,645
Speaker 8:  all of this is insane but we're gonna get to that point

1072
01:00:37,655 --> 01:00:41,205
Speaker 8:  eventually. But right now we're very much in this arms race. And I think

1073
01:00:41,205 --> 01:00:45,165
Speaker 8:  especially the way you have to understand the arms race is these two companies

1074
01:00:45,165 --> 01:00:48,445
Speaker 8:  in particular, OpenAI and Google are in a massive

1075
01:00:49,035 --> 01:00:52,925
Speaker 8:  land grab for developer resources, right? Like if, if every company on earth

1076
01:00:52,925 --> 01:00:56,285
Speaker 8:  is at some point going to have an AI strategy and at this moment that's what

1077
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:59,975
Speaker 8:  it looks like, there are basically two players

1078
01:01:00,025 --> 01:01:03,535
Speaker 8:  right now they can give a whole lot of money to. And

1079
01:01:03,865 --> 01:01:07,015
Speaker 8:  there is a lot of money in winning that. Like think about what AWS did for

1080
01:01:07,015 --> 01:01:10,855
Speaker 8:  Amazon, right? Because it was early to, we're very good at giving you developer

1081
01:01:11,015 --> 01:01:14,775
Speaker 8:  resources in the cloud. There is now a belief that the market for AI is gonna

1082
01:01:14,775 --> 01:01:17,295
Speaker 8:  be even bigger and happen even faster. So these companies are just running

1083
01:01:17,315 --> 01:01:21,215
Speaker 8:  as fast as they possibly can and they honestly don't care all that much if

1084
01:01:21,215 --> 01:01:25,175
Speaker 8:  the version numbers don't make any sense to us as users. But so Gemini

1085
01:01:25,175 --> 01:01:29,135
Speaker 8:  1.5 is coming out and at some point it will just sort of wholly

1086
01:01:29,135 --> 01:01:33,055
Speaker 8:  replace Gemini 1.0 and

1087
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:36,455
Speaker 8:  there's the three sizes of it. There's Ultra, which is like the big full

1088
01:01:36,455 --> 01:01:39,655
Speaker 8:  model, all the epic stuff. The Pro which is the middle one, which is the

1089
01:01:39,655 --> 01:01:42,215
Speaker 8:  one that most consumers see. And then there's Nano which is specifically

1090
01:01:42,375 --> 01:01:46,095
Speaker 8:  designed to run on people's devices. Google hasn't talked much about Nano

1091
01:01:46,115 --> 01:01:49,775
Speaker 8:  yet on any of its Gemini stuff, but that's an I think,

1092
01:01:50,015 --> 01:01:53,855
Speaker 8:  interesting piece of it. The big thing with Gemini 1.5 is that

1093
01:01:53,915 --> 01:01:56,775
Speaker 8:  its context window is much bigger. And essentially what that means is you

1094
01:01:56,775 --> 01:01:59,735
Speaker 8:  can just put a lot more stuff into it at a time

1095
01:02:00,885 --> 01:02:04,575
Speaker 8:  when you, there's a bunch of like weird complicated math to do, but

1096
01:02:04,575 --> 01:02:08,295
Speaker 8:  typically they say it's like three quarters of a word is a

1097
01:02:08,305 --> 01:02:12,175
Speaker 8:  token and Google's context window for Gemini 1.5 is

1098
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:16,215
Speaker 8:  a million tokens, which is a lot of words you can do hours

1099
01:02:16,215 --> 01:02:19,575
Speaker 8:  of video, hours of audio, all kinds of different stuff. So you can just plug

1100
01:02:19,575 --> 01:02:23,495
Speaker 8:  all this in and then ask questions about it, do stuff with

1101
01:02:23,495 --> 01:02:27,175
Speaker 8:  it. And they have, they have big ideas about what people might do with this

1102
01:02:27,245 --> 01:02:30,855
Speaker 8:  huge context window and there's a lot coming.

1103
01:02:31,075 --> 01:02:34,295
Speaker 5:  So we could put like the entire B movie in there

1104
01:02:35,075 --> 01:02:38,295
Speaker 5:  and then find out like if we were supposed to really think there was a romance

1105
01:02:38,295 --> 01:02:39,815
Speaker 5:  between a human woman and a be

1106
01:02:40,765 --> 01:02:43,535
Speaker 7:  That is a great question to ask a computer actually. Yeah. It was like do

1107
01:02:43,535 --> 01:02:44,695
Speaker 7:  you detect love? Yeah,

1108
01:02:45,935 --> 01:02:46,775
Speaker 5:  I really wanna do

1109
01:02:46,775 --> 01:02:47,735
Speaker 7:  This. Let me have the difficult for

1110
01:02:47,735 --> 01:02:49,775
Speaker 5:  You If, you do this, please, please email me.

1111
01:02:49,925 --> 01:02:53,535
Speaker 7:  There's a great exchange in David's report on this where I think

1112
01:02:54,455 --> 01:02:57,615
Speaker 7:  Sundar says you could fit the entire Lord of the Rings movie into the context

1113
01:02:57,615 --> 01:02:59,535
Speaker 7:  window and David's like, that means that's happened to Google.

1114
01:02:59,715 --> 01:03:03,615
Speaker 8:  He said it so without thinking that he was just like it was, it was as

1115
01:03:03,615 --> 01:03:06,735
Speaker 8:  if he had like left the Lord of the Rings meeting right before talking to

1116
01:03:06,735 --> 01:03:06,815
Speaker 8:  me.

1117
01:03:08,365 --> 01:03:08,855
Speaker 7:  It's just like

1118
01:03:08,855 --> 01:03:09,895
Speaker 8:  This definitely happened. Right.

1119
01:03:11,485 --> 01:03:12,055
Speaker 7:  It's very good.

1120
01:03:13,795 --> 01:03:17,655
Speaker 7:  What's fascinating to me about all of this is yes there's an arms race for

1121
01:03:17,655 --> 01:03:21,615
Speaker 7:  developers. There are still, I, I think we're hitting the same

1122
01:03:21,615 --> 01:03:25,595
Speaker 7:  place with AI in a slightly longer time frame as people

1123
01:03:25,595 --> 01:03:28,595
Speaker 7:  are hitting on with the Vision Pro in a slightly shorter timeframe where

1124
01:03:28,595 --> 01:03:31,995
Speaker 7:  you're like, it's really cool, fastest consumer adoption history and now

1125
01:03:31,995 --> 01:03:33,795
Speaker 7:  we've all just run into the limits. That's right.

1126
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:34,155
Speaker 8:  Yes.

1127
01:03:34,365 --> 01:03:38,225
Speaker 7:  Right. And I think developers love it 'cause they can build new apps, they

1128
01:03:38,225 --> 01:03:41,945
Speaker 7:  can certainly go get funding from VCs. You can write code with it, which

1129
01:03:41,945 --> 01:03:45,225
Speaker 7:  I think people really love to do and sort of everywhere else it's like what

1130
01:03:45,225 --> 01:03:48,905
Speaker 7:  I can do is produce spam at a higher rate than spam has ever been

1131
01:03:49,105 --> 01:03:52,105
Speaker 7:  produced before. Yeah. And turn the internet into a feted swamp.

1132
01:03:52,605 --> 01:03:56,545
Speaker 5:  Oh the the corporate folks love it. Yeah. 'cause they're

1133
01:03:56,545 --> 01:03:59,905
Speaker 5:  like, yeah, I can just have it do all my emails when I have to do a memo,

1134
01:04:00,185 --> 01:04:04,065
Speaker 5:  I just have it write the first draft of my memo for me. And you're like,

1135
01:04:04,775 --> 01:04:07,745
Speaker 5:  well you shouldn't do that don't you? You should write.

1136
01:04:08,445 --> 01:04:09,145
Speaker 5:  That's important.

1137
01:04:09,565 --> 01:04:13,545
Speaker 7:  Oh, I, I actually, I think sending corporate emails with ais, I

1138
01:04:13,545 --> 01:04:15,785
Speaker 7:  don't actually send a lot of emails. Same. I refuse to use enterprise software.

1139
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:16,065
Speaker 7:  Same.

1140
01:04:16,575 --> 01:04:17,625
Speaker 5:  Well not that part but the

1141
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:18,025
Speaker 7:  Thing about me.

1142
01:04:19,685 --> 01:04:23,225
Speaker 7:  But like the idea that some transactional email

1143
01:04:23,725 --> 01:04:27,505
Speaker 7:  is better written by AI than fine, but like that is a pretty small

1144
01:04:27,725 --> 01:04:31,625
Speaker 7:  use case on the grand order of things. Yeah. I'm

1145
01:04:31,625 --> 01:04:34,585
Speaker 7:  wondering like David, as you looked at this model as you played with Ultra

1146
01:04:35,285 --> 01:04:39,185
Speaker 7:  as you've played with the other ones, do you see that next set of big uses

1147
01:04:39,215 --> 01:04:39,945
Speaker 7:  showing up?

1148
01:04:41,285 --> 01:04:45,145
Speaker 8:  No, I think there there's going to be an increasing kind of

1149
01:04:45,785 --> 01:04:47,905
Speaker 8:  creative state of the art. Like one of the other things that happened this

1150
01:04:47,905 --> 01:04:51,705
Speaker 8:  week was OpenAI launched Sora, which is its text to

1151
01:04:51,705 --> 01:04:55,625
Speaker 8:  video model and So I think the kind of state of the art of stuff you

1152
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:59,265
Speaker 8:  can make creatively. There's a just massive

1153
01:05:00,455 --> 01:05:03,185
Speaker 8:  room left to go and there's gonna be all kinds of cool stuff on that front.

1154
01:05:03,685 --> 01:05:07,625
Speaker 8:  But I think we've been talking about on the show for a while now, when

1155
01:05:07,625 --> 01:05:11,585
Speaker 8:  is the sort of novelty of using these AI chatbots going to

1156
01:05:11,585 --> 01:05:15,465
Speaker 8:  wear off? And we're there. I think it's happening and, and one of the

1157
01:05:15,465 --> 01:05:18,445
Speaker 8:  other things I'm starting to see all over social is a lot of people who started

1158
01:05:18,445 --> 01:05:22,205
Speaker 8:  paying for copilot from Microsoft and are now canceling it and

1159
01:05:22,205 --> 01:05:26,045
Speaker 8:  people are starting to sign up for Gemini Advanced with $20 a month, people

1160
01:05:26,045 --> 01:05:29,525
Speaker 8:  are starting to goof around with it. And you, you look at it and it's like

1161
01:05:29,585 --> 01:05:32,605
Speaker 8:  the thing so many people keep saying about the Vision Pro is like amazing

1162
01:05:32,615 --> 01:05:33,285
Speaker 8:  technology.

1163
01:05:34,865 --> 01:05:38,065
Speaker 8:  I, I took it off and kind of never had a reason to put it on again. And I

1164
01:05:38,065 --> 01:05:41,665
Speaker 8:  think a lot of people are starting to feel that way, especially in the sort

1165
01:05:41,665 --> 01:05:45,065
Speaker 8:  of one-to-one consumer use case about

1166
01:05:45,685 --> 01:05:49,025
Speaker 8:  AI stuff. And also I think that's why all these companies are going after

1167
01:05:49,945 --> 01:05:53,865
Speaker 8:  companies because if I'm already signed up for this stuff through

1168
01:05:54,045 --> 01:05:57,865
Speaker 8:  my organization, like yeah, I'll use it to make it easier to make

1169
01:05:57,885 --> 01:05:58,745
Speaker 8:  charts or whatever.

1170
01:05:58,945 --> 01:06:02,625
Speaker 5:  I mean that was Microsoft's whole strategy, right? Like get copilot out so

1171
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:06,025
Speaker 7:  Right. Yeah. But copilot is 20 bucks a month to make charts easier. Yeah,

1172
01:06:06,025 --> 01:06:09,785
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But you're like a IT guy with endless budget

1173
01:06:10,085 --> 01:06:11,065
Speaker 5:  at a big company.

1174
01:06:11,325 --> 01:06:15,065
Speaker 7:  The days of endless IT budgets are over Who knows, right? You can see all

1175
01:06:15,065 --> 01:06:17,665
Speaker 7:  these companies are contracting and they're like not spending lots of money.

1176
01:06:17,815 --> 01:06:21,785
Speaker 7:  Like I, that to me is like this is the big gap. I will say

1177
01:06:21,785 --> 01:06:25,505
Speaker 7:  that I recently set the action button on my iPhone 15 Pro to

1178
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:29,985
Speaker 7:  open the chat GPT voice assistant, just the cheap one, 3.5, not four, not

1179
01:06:29,985 --> 01:06:33,105
Speaker 7:  the one you have to be for. And it is like, oh they should just make Siri

1180
01:06:33,105 --> 01:06:36,905
Speaker 7:  this. Yep. Like they should throw Siri away and they should just

1181
01:06:36,905 --> 01:06:39,985
Speaker 7:  make Siri this. It is revelatory

1182
01:06:40,615 --> 01:06:44,105
Speaker 7:  when you're like, the other day we had to reheat chicken wings from the super

1183
01:06:44,105 --> 01:06:48,025
Speaker 7:  Bowl and I just asked my phone and it said an answer to me. Was

1184
01:06:48,025 --> 01:06:50,305
Speaker 7:  that answer correct? Did it lie?

1185
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:51,665
Speaker 5:  How? How were the,

1186
01:06:51,885 --> 01:06:55,745
Speaker 7:  Did it hallucinate the temperature and the time? It was fine because

1187
01:06:55,805 --> 01:06:58,945
Speaker 7:  the stakes were so low. Yeah, I asked it. I asked it twice.

1188
01:06:58,945 --> 01:07:00,305
Speaker 5:  Chicken wings is high stakes though.

1189
01:07:00,305 --> 01:07:03,385
Speaker 7:  Like no, they're not reheating. Well it's true. It's,

1190
01:07:03,465 --> 01:07:04,785
Speaker 5:  I was like reheating. That's yeah, that's fair.

1191
01:07:05,055 --> 01:07:08,545
Speaker 7:  Does it? Because I asked it twice and the first time I said 350 degrees the

1192
01:07:08,545 --> 01:07:12,225
Speaker 7:  second I said 3, 7, 5 and I was like, this doesn't matter. Boop,

1193
01:07:12,525 --> 01:07:16,185
Speaker 7:  the stakes are very low here and I didn't have to trawl the

1194
01:07:16,395 --> 01:07:20,145
Speaker 7:  SEOed internet. Yeah. And Siri, I asked Siri and Siri

1195
01:07:20,205 --> 01:07:21,865
Speaker 7:  was like, I don't know like just

1196
01:07:21,925 --> 01:07:25,505
Speaker 5:  If it's a 200, would you have been like in there be like, this feels wrong

1197
01:07:25,565 --> 01:07:26,385
Speaker 5:  but I'll go with it.

1198
01:07:26,445 --> 01:07:30,105
Speaker 7:  That's how I describe the cha g BT use case. you know that old Stephen Colbert

1199
01:07:30,105 --> 01:07:34,065
Speaker 7:  word truthiness? Yeah. Like if you're comfortable with something that

1200
01:07:34,065 --> 01:07:37,985
Speaker 7:  just feels right, I really encourage you to set cha GBT to

1201
01:07:37,985 --> 01:07:39,065
Speaker 7:  your action button. So,

1202
01:07:39,065 --> 01:07:42,985
Speaker 8:  But actually that's a really good like example of

1203
01:07:43,205 --> 01:07:46,425
Speaker 8:  the problem that all these companies are having, right? Like Google is

1204
01:07:46,655 --> 01:07:50,425
Speaker 8:  essentially ripping and replacing Google Assistant with Gemini for the same

1205
01:07:50,425 --> 01:07:53,105
Speaker 8:  reason. Yeah. Like this stuff is going to be better at those things. Would

1206
01:07:53,105 --> 01:07:56,025
Speaker 8:  you pay $20 a month for the thing that you just described? Like no, absolutely

1207
01:07:56,025 --> 01:07:59,105
Speaker 8:  nobody would. And so there's going to be this like

1208
01:07:59,595 --> 01:08:03,505
Speaker 8:  mainstream use case for this stuff that no one will pay for

1209
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:07,745
Speaker 8:  and then there's going to be a ton of money. At least that's what these companies

1210
01:08:07,745 --> 01:08:11,665
Speaker 8:  are betting in the business use cases. But to me it feels like we

1211
01:08:11,665 --> 01:08:15,565
Speaker 8:  are quickly hitting something like

1212
01:08:15,685 --> 01:08:19,205
Speaker 8:  a ceiling of what people actually wanna do with these things day in and day

1213
01:08:19,205 --> 01:08:22,725
Speaker 8:  out. Like a million token context window does not make you better

1214
01:08:23,225 --> 01:08:26,485
Speaker 8:  at chicken wings. It just doesn't. And So I think that

1215
01:08:26,995 --> 01:08:30,325
Speaker 8:  next thing for regular people is gonna have to come from somewhere else.

1216
01:08:30,385 --> 01:08:33,365
Speaker 8:  And there's a bunch of different ways these companies are trying to do it.

1217
01:08:34,025 --> 01:08:37,885
Speaker 8:  OpenAI has been making a bunch of tweaks to like how it builds

1218
01:08:37,945 --> 01:08:40,845
Speaker 8:  its models to try and make them sort of smarter and more efficient. It also

1219
01:08:40,925 --> 01:08:44,005
Speaker 8:  launched a thing this week called memory where it can actually remember things

1220
01:08:44,005 --> 01:08:46,965
Speaker 8:  about you and what you like and your preferences so that it should sort of

1221
01:08:47,125 --> 01:08:50,325
Speaker 8:  interact with you in a more human and like friendly way over time.

1222
01:08:51,145 --> 01:08:54,445
Speaker 8:  That's the stuff that I think is gonna be interesting. Just building bigger

1223
01:08:54,465 --> 01:08:58,405
Speaker 8:  models to do more high-end stuff is like purely a business play.

1224
01:08:58,545 --> 01:09:02,205
Speaker 8:  And I think you're right that $20 per person per month is more money than

1225
01:09:02,205 --> 01:09:05,125
Speaker 8:  most companies have to spend at this moment in time. Yeah. So Don don't know.

1226
01:09:05,205 --> 01:09:07,805
Speaker 8:  I don't know which of those things is gonna catch up first. Can you

1227
01:09:07,805 --> 01:09:10,205
Speaker 5:  Imagine spending $20 a month for like

1228
01:09:11,665 --> 01:09:15,345
Speaker 5:  possibly right? Possibly wrong chicken wings, reheating instructions.

1229
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:21,025
Speaker 7:  I mean I think If, you just buy chicken wings at restaurants.

1230
01:09:21,325 --> 01:09:23,265
Speaker 7:  You're always, it's always, you've already, you've already, are they gonna

1231
01:09:23,265 --> 01:09:26,305
Speaker 7:  be good? Yeah. If your chicken wings budget is 20 bucks a month, it's a gamble

1232
01:09:26,305 --> 01:09:27,705
Speaker 7:  every time. True. That's

1233
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:27,745
Speaker 5:  Fair.

1234
01:09:28,815 --> 01:09:30,665
Speaker 7:  Chicken wings are a big deal. They

1235
01:09:30,665 --> 01:09:32,145
Speaker 5:  Are very important.

1236
01:09:32,945 --> 01:09:36,825
Speaker 7:  I want to talk about the other side of the AI debate real quick. David, you

1237
01:09:36,825 --> 01:09:40,665
Speaker 7:  wrote about robots txt this week. I did Sora Jong and I talked about the

1238
01:09:40,665 --> 01:09:44,385
Speaker 7:  copyright battles that are facing all these AI companies

1239
01:09:44,445 --> 01:09:48,385
Speaker 7:  on decoder. There's something else here, right? These companies

1240
01:09:48,385 --> 01:09:52,345
Speaker 7:  are forging ahead with ever bigger models, ever. More

1241
01:09:52,365 --> 01:09:54,985
Speaker 7:  use cases, higher prices. And the

1242
01:09:56,145 --> 01:10:00,115
Speaker 7:  sort of underlying question of is it okay to take all this stuff to make

1243
01:10:00,115 --> 01:10:03,915
Speaker 7:  the models remains extraordinarily unresolved? The

1244
01:10:03,915 --> 01:10:07,795
Speaker 7:  Sora Silverman case, a group of authors including Sora Silverman suing Open

1245
01:10:07,855 --> 01:10:11,555
Speaker 7:  Eye, they just had a setback in their case, all of the claims

1246
01:10:11,935 --> 01:10:15,195
Speaker 7:  except direct copyright infringement, which is a big deal, but all the other

1247
01:10:15,195 --> 01:10:19,115
Speaker 7:  claims are thrown out. The judge seemed very skeptical there. There

1248
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:22,875
Speaker 7:  are some like specific concerns in there that are pretty wonky, so we don't

1249
01:10:22,875 --> 01:10:26,795
Speaker 7:  have to go into them, but that case is getting whittled down. I

1250
01:10:26,795 --> 01:10:30,595
Speaker 7:  think the Times case against OpenAI is a little bit stronger. So we'll see.

1251
01:10:30,695 --> 01:10:34,515
Speaker 7:  But we don't know if these companies can even do it. Like

1252
01:10:34,945 --> 01:10:38,555
Speaker 7:  whether this is copyright infringement such that the courts just shut down

1253
01:10:38,555 --> 01:10:42,435
Speaker 7:  the entire notion of this to begin with. Or if that payments that they're

1254
01:10:42,635 --> 01:10:46,395
Speaker 7:  required to make become so high that the business models don't work out

1255
01:10:46,895 --> 01:10:49,915
Speaker 7:  all open questions. Right. And then David, I want you to talk about robots

1256
01:10:50,175 --> 01:10:54,035
Speaker 7:  txt because there's this little handshake agreement of a text

1257
01:10:54,035 --> 01:10:57,875
Speaker 7:  file on every website and that handshake agreement is like

1258
01:10:57,875 --> 01:11:01,835
Speaker 7:  one hand is just crushing the other one and it's like this thing can't

1259
01:11:01,835 --> 01:11:03,755
Speaker 7:  support the weight of it, I don't think.

1260
01:11:04,025 --> 01:11:07,955
Speaker 8:  Yeah. So, I got, I got sort of obsessed with this years ago when I first

1261
01:11:07,955 --> 01:11:11,155
Speaker 8:  started talking to people about Google Amp for a story I wrote, which is

1262
01:11:11,155 --> 01:11:15,085
Speaker 8:  basically like, what is the value exchange on the internet,

1263
01:11:15,085 --> 01:11:19,005
Speaker 8:  right? And it turns out that a lot of the sort of policing of the internet

1264
01:11:19,005 --> 01:11:22,845
Speaker 8:  happens in that file. You named robots txt If. you go to almost any website

1265
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:27,365
Speaker 8:  and then just put a slash robots txt, it'll pop up a text

1266
01:11:27,365 --> 01:11:31,045
Speaker 8:  file that you can see that basically decides which

1267
01:11:31,845 --> 01:11:35,805
Speaker 8:  crawlers from around the web are and are not allowed to go

1268
01:11:35,835 --> 01:11:39,445
Speaker 8:  onto a website. So crawlers exist for lots of reasons. Many of them are from

1269
01:11:39,445 --> 01:11:41,845
Speaker 8:  search engines, which are indexing the web in order to be able to send search

1270
01:11:41,845 --> 01:11:45,325
Speaker 8:  results. Amazon has a crawler that checks for pricing around the web for

1271
01:11:45,325 --> 01:11:48,045
Speaker 8:  what the government would say are extremely nefarious reasons. And Amazon

1272
01:11:48,045 --> 01:11:51,605
Speaker 8:  would say are for legitimate business reasons, you might run a crawler to

1273
01:11:51,605 --> 01:11:54,045
Speaker 8:  check all the links on your own site to make sure that they're still live.

1274
01:11:54,045 --> 01:11:57,525
Speaker 8:  Like there are a lot of reasons to run crawlers, and this is like a technology

1275
01:11:57,595 --> 01:12:01,285
Speaker 8:  from the early nineties that basically a bunch of people on a

1276
01:12:01,285 --> 01:12:05,245
Speaker 8:  mailing list, including like Tim Burners Lee and Mark Andreessen and a bunch

1277
01:12:05,245 --> 01:12:09,165
Speaker 8:  of like early internet optimists decided is

1278
01:12:09,165 --> 01:12:12,205
Speaker 8:  like, okay, you're just gonna put up this thing that says essentially who's

1279
01:12:12,205 --> 01:12:15,845
Speaker 8:  in and who's out. And everyone else who makes one of these crawlers is gonna

1280
01:12:15,845 --> 01:12:18,485
Speaker 8:  abide by those rules because we want the internet to work. We're all cool

1281
01:12:18,485 --> 01:12:21,965
Speaker 8:  people, this is gonna be great. That works pretty well for a

1282
01:12:21,965 --> 01:12:25,765
Speaker 8:  surprisingly long time. And now what's happening is If, you run an AI company

1283
01:12:25,765 --> 01:12:28,005
Speaker 8:  and you wanna get a bunch of training data. You know what's full of training

1284
01:12:28,005 --> 01:12:31,765
Speaker 8:  data is the internet. And so you just go, you crawl the whole internet, you

1285
01:12:31,765 --> 01:12:34,805
Speaker 8:  pull all that stuff in, you dump it in and you train your model on it. That's

1286
01:12:34,805 --> 01:12:38,165
Speaker 8:  how you get recipes. That's how you get all this stuff. Like you just base

1287
01:12:38,165 --> 01:12:42,005
Speaker 8:  it on all the stuff that exists on the public internet. And so now if you're

1288
01:12:42,605 --> 01:12:46,365
Speaker 8:  a person who runs a website or a recipe

1289
01:12:46,675 --> 01:12:50,605
Speaker 8:  blog or any number of other things on the internet, you have to

1290
01:12:50,605 --> 01:12:54,405
Speaker 8:  go in and decide who's in and who's out with a thousand

1291
01:12:54,545 --> 01:12:58,445
Speaker 8:  new crawlers, a bunch of companies of varying levels of

1292
01:12:59,115 --> 01:13:02,805
Speaker 8:  decency. And Sketchiness, OpenAI has been in a bunch of like

1293
01:13:03,295 --> 01:13:06,885
Speaker 8:  media coverage about this because it actually told people how to block

1294
01:13:07,245 --> 01:13:10,645
Speaker 8:  GPT bot and promise to abide by it and by all accounts is doing. So

1295
01:13:11,285 --> 01:13:14,925
Speaker 8:  a huge portion of websites on the internet, including I believe all of Vox

1296
01:13:14,925 --> 01:13:18,885
Speaker 8:  Media blocked GPT bot, the New York Times did a lot of publishers have.

1297
01:13:19,705 --> 01:13:23,525
Speaker 8:  But there are a lot of things out there that are either too small

1298
01:13:23,585 --> 01:13:26,925
Speaker 8:  for now to even be known to these publishers

1299
01:13:27,665 --> 01:13:31,485
Speaker 8:  or just don't care. They just don't have to respect this little tiny

1300
01:13:31,515 --> 01:13:34,725
Speaker 8:  text file that has no legal or technical authority. And

1301
01:13:35,425 --> 01:13:39,085
Speaker 8:  so any AI that wants to come in just can, and that's just where we are.

1302
01:13:39,425 --> 01:13:43,365
Speaker 8:  And we have just like broken this basic give and take that

1303
01:13:43,365 --> 01:13:47,165
Speaker 8:  the internet ran on for so long. And like I talked to Tony Stubble mine

1304
01:13:47,185 --> 01:13:50,885
Speaker 8:  at the CEO of Medium who has been a big proponent of

1305
01:13:51,675 --> 01:13:55,565
Speaker 8:  kicking out the bots in, in this particular way. And what

1306
01:13:55,565 --> 01:13:59,045
Speaker 8:  he said is basically like we're, we're getting nothing out of this exchange.

1307
01:13:59,275 --> 01:14:03,125
Speaker 8:  They're just taking everything from us and telling us that,

1308
01:14:03,125 --> 01:14:06,765
Speaker 8:  you know, it's for the good of society and like, screw that. That's not,

1309
01:14:06,865 --> 01:14:09,365
Speaker 8:  that's not how the internet works. That's not what we're after. And I think

1310
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:12,885
Speaker 8:  everyone on the internet now is starting to have to make that exact same

1311
01:14:13,705 --> 01:14:15,005
Speaker 8:  set of decisions.

1312
01:14:15,905 --> 01:14:19,685
Speaker 7:  And what's fascinating is OpenAI only made

1313
01:14:19,925 --> 01:14:23,765
Speaker 7:  GPT bot blockable after they had scraped the

1314
01:14:23,885 --> 01:14:23,965
Speaker 7:  internet.

1315
01:14:24,205 --> 01:14:24,725
Speaker 8:  Correct. It's

1316
01:14:24,725 --> 01:14:28,685
Speaker 7:  Like, and I, I honestly think that they did that so that media

1317
01:14:28,685 --> 01:14:32,365
Speaker 7:  organizations, and I have, I'm not privy to what Vox Media does

1318
01:14:32,465 --> 01:14:36,205
Speaker 7:  at that level. I don't know why they did that or didn't do that. Yeah. But

1319
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:39,845
Speaker 7:  I'm pretty sure they did it. So media organizations, companies could block

1320
01:14:39,945 --> 01:14:43,845
Speaker 7:  OpenAI and then and feel like they had some control and then

1321
01:14:44,025 --> 01:14:47,725
Speaker 7:  OpenAI could go make a deal, right. And be like, oh no, we're you took the

1322
01:14:47,965 --> 01:14:49,005
Speaker 7:  control away from us. No,

1323
01:14:49,395 --> 01:14:52,605
Speaker 8:  That is, I I will say that is precisely why. Yeah. I mean I talked to the

1324
01:14:52,755 --> 01:14:56,525
Speaker 8:  open chief strategy officer who said basically that exact thing that, that

1325
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:59,205
Speaker 8:  it is, this is a way to signal that you would like to make a commercial deal

1326
01:14:59,585 --> 01:15:03,405
Speaker 8:  and let's do it. And that is a pretty

1327
01:15:03,595 --> 01:15:07,485
Speaker 8:  wild way of, of backing into something like that. But yeah, it is,

1328
01:15:07,515 --> 01:15:11,285
Speaker 8:  it's not an accident that OpenAI didn't tell people about

1329
01:15:11,405 --> 01:15:14,965
Speaker 8:  GPT bot until it had already been pretty far down the road. Yeah. Because

1330
01:15:14,965 --> 01:15:18,885
Speaker 8:  without doing what it did, it GPT-4 and chat

1331
01:15:18,965 --> 01:15:22,125
Speaker 8:  GPT wouldn't be as good as they are. Like that that is the trade. But then

1332
01:15:22,125 --> 01:15:26,045
Speaker 8:  the question is, who experiences the downside of

1333
01:15:26,045 --> 01:15:29,325
Speaker 8:  that? Like, is that bad for the internet? Is it bad for the world or is it

1334
01:15:29,325 --> 01:15:32,005
Speaker 8:  just bad for OpenAI? It's like, that's the question now.

1335
01:15:32,515 --> 01:15:35,885
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And I think individual creators are feeling the pain of this

1336
01:15:36,555 --> 01:15:40,485
Speaker 7:  very deeply. Yeah. Even when we just write about neat

1337
01:15:40,625 --> 01:15:44,525
Speaker 7:  AI tools, we get people who are sort of morally outraged that we would

1338
01:15:44,525 --> 01:15:48,005
Speaker 7:  acknowledge that some of them are neat because it's built on

1339
01:15:48,715 --> 01:15:52,205
Speaker 7:  something, it's built on some taking and whether or not you think that taking

1340
01:15:52,225 --> 01:15:56,045
Speaker 7:  is fair or not is sort of divorced from whether it's legal or not.

1341
01:15:56,825 --> 01:16:00,085
Speaker 7:  And I, I don't know that anyone has quite figured that out. Right. Somebody

1342
01:16:00,175 --> 01:16:03,685
Speaker 5:  Needs to pop it into, am I the asshole on Reddit? Like it's a,

1343
01:16:03,685 --> 01:16:04,485
Speaker 7:  It's, that's what he needs to do.

1344
01:16:04,635 --> 01:16:05,725
Speaker 5:  It's a perfect one. Right.

1345
01:16:05,985 --> 01:16:09,205
Speaker 7:  And then answer all of that into the million token

1346
01:16:09,585 --> 01:16:11,925
Speaker 7:  Gemini field's, like, is this correct? Yeah.

1347
01:16:11,925 --> 01:16:14,885
Speaker 5:  And then we, we send it to the judges and we're like, look, we figured it

1348
01:16:14,885 --> 01:16:18,245
Speaker 5:  out. The robots figured it out. They, they talked to each other. We got this,

1349
01:16:19,185 --> 01:16:22,005
Speaker 5:  we know who the asshole is. That means who legally is. Right.

1350
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:27,075
Speaker 7:  Again, I keep, I keep coming back to what I I I refer to as the end

1351
01:16:27,075 --> 01:16:30,835
Speaker 7:  game post. Yeah. Which is a person who's like, I love podcasts, but I don't

1352
01:16:30,835 --> 01:16:33,355
Speaker 7:  have time for them. I just feed them into an AI and then it's ri and it's

1353
01:16:33,355 --> 01:16:34,755
Speaker 7:  like, dude, you just want articles? Yeah.

1354
01:16:35,585 --> 01:16:35,875
Speaker 5:  Just

1355
01:16:35,875 --> 01:16:38,835
Speaker 7:  Go read those. What you want is articles. Like just go read articles made

1356
01:16:38,835 --> 01:16:40,035
Speaker 7:  by people who care about you.

1357
01:16:41,745 --> 01:16:44,875
Speaker 7:  Like it's a very simple, very simple way of getting what you want from the

1358
01:16:44,995 --> 01:16:48,275
Speaker 7:  internet. Read, read, like people would like to read.

1359
01:16:49,215 --> 01:16:53,035
Speaker 7:  It is amazing that the, the broad future of computing is like more

1360
01:16:53,035 --> 01:16:56,035
Speaker 7:  reading. Yeah. After all these anyway, doesn't matter.

1361
01:16:57,195 --> 01:17:00,355
Speaker 7:  I think that the turn for these AI companies, for OpenAI, for example,

1362
01:17:01,415 --> 01:17:04,355
Speaker 7:  you can signaling want commercial deals, but they're being sued. So If, you

1363
01:17:04,355 --> 01:17:07,195
Speaker 7:  go out and make a bunch of deals, you're kind of admitting that you need

1364
01:17:07,195 --> 01:17:10,995
Speaker 7:  the deals and the New York Times is gonna, or whoever else is suing

1365
01:17:10,995 --> 01:17:14,195
Speaker 7:  OpenAI Getty's suing stability is gonna say, look, you know

1366
01:17:14,825 --> 01:17:18,035
Speaker 7:  that you should pay money for this stuff you didn't pay us

1367
01:17:19,095 --> 01:17:22,395
Speaker 7:  to begin with. So you're on the, and I that is a

1368
01:17:23,515 --> 01:17:24,595
Speaker 7:  strategic nightmare for these companies.

1369
01:17:24,655 --> 01:17:28,155
Speaker 8:  It is. And I think James Kwan, the, the chief strategy officer at OpenAI

1370
01:17:28,275 --> 01:17:31,075
Speaker 8:  I was talking to, one of the things he said is, and this kinda goes back

1371
01:17:31,075 --> 01:17:34,635
Speaker 8:  to what we were talking about before, is that OpenAI feels very strongly

1372
01:17:34,785 --> 01:17:38,555
Speaker 8:  that chat GPT should be mostly free for most people

1373
01:17:38,655 --> 01:17:42,075
Speaker 8:  for exactly that reason. Like that's the value they believe they deliver

1374
01:17:42,075 --> 01:17:45,795
Speaker 8:  back to the world is that by giving to

1375
01:17:45,795 --> 01:17:49,235
Speaker 8:  this system, you then get access to this system and the, the

1376
01:17:49,635 --> 01:17:53,235
Speaker 8:  increase in quality of this system is good for the world and you can have

1377
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:56,635
Speaker 8:  it and it will make your life better. And I think you can view that as like

1378
01:17:56,825 --> 01:18:00,555
Speaker 8:  dystopian black mirror nonsense or you can view that as like a fair

1379
01:18:00,555 --> 01:18:03,995
Speaker 8:  trade in the way that Google search was a fair trade. But like that is the

1380
01:18:03,995 --> 01:18:07,835
Speaker 8:  dynamic that we're about to reckon with in a lot of really, really

1381
01:18:07,835 --> 01:18:08,915
Speaker 8:  messy ways. Yeah.

1382
01:18:08,915 --> 01:18:12,515
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And what is the most fascinating about all this? We can bring it all

1383
01:18:12,515 --> 01:18:16,075
Speaker 7:  the way back around to Google. No one is gonna block the Google bot. Yeah.

1384
01:18:16,075 --> 01:18:19,715
Speaker 7:  Correct. Like no one thinks it should be invisible from search. You can

1385
01:18:19,885 --> 01:18:23,515
Speaker 7:  block current sites, probably would, I don't know what those are.

1386
01:18:25,855 --> 01:18:29,115
Speaker 7:  Alex's Plex server continues to rock and roll in the background. No one's

1387
01:18:29,195 --> 01:18:32,915
Speaker 7:  blocking Alex's Plex server use net to block. You can block Google with

1388
01:18:33,145 --> 01:18:36,715
Speaker 7:  some gradations. You can block Google search, which no one will do. And then

1389
01:18:36,715 --> 01:18:40,195
Speaker 7:  you can block the other stuff. Right? You can block Google's AI training,

1390
01:18:40,575 --> 01:18:44,195
Speaker 7:  but no one is willing to say, I'm so mad at Google for scraping all of our

1391
01:18:44,195 --> 01:18:47,755
Speaker 7:  stuff that we're gonna block search. And I think that's when that one

1392
01:18:47,885 --> 01:18:51,515
Speaker 7:  flips and people are like, it is worth it to be invisible to Google. Like

1393
01:18:51,575 --> 01:18:55,515
Speaker 7:  the architecture of the internet changes. Yes. All right, we gotta take a

1394
01:18:55,515 --> 01:18:58,835
Speaker 7:  break. We're gonna come back the lightning round sponsored by you.

1395
01:19:32,035 --> 01:19:35,885
Speaker 15:  It's been a big week for Taylor Swift and Drake, but they weren't

1396
01:19:35,885 --> 01:19:39,285
Speaker 15:  playing on one of their biggest platforms. Not a single one of their songs

1397
01:19:39,745 --> 01:19:43,205
Speaker 15:  was on TikTok. Instead we've got stuff like this.

1398
01:19:43,665 --> 01:19:43,885
Speaker 15:  Oh,

1399
01:19:44,075 --> 01:19:46,685
Speaker 14:  It's shame by your body,

1400
01:19:48,185 --> 01:19:49,485
Speaker 14:  the feeling, God,

1401
01:19:52,355 --> 01:19:52,645
Speaker 14:  it's,

1402
01:19:53,705 --> 01:19:54,805
Speaker 15:  And this, it's

1403
01:19:54,805 --> 01:19:58,005
Speaker 13:  Like my bear right? Whoa, my man

1404
01:19:58,515 --> 01:20:00,165
Speaker 13:  back at me sing it.

1405
01:20:02,625 --> 01:20:04,125
Speaker 15:  And good heavens this

1406
01:20:08,805 --> 01:20:09,005
Speaker 14:  Together

1407
01:20:11,105 --> 01:20:11,325
Speaker 14:  on

1408
01:20:11,325 --> 01:20:14,125
Speaker 15:  What on Today explained, we're looking into why the biggest record label

1409
01:20:14,185 --> 01:20:17,885
Speaker 15:  in the world is picking a fight with the app that's constantly promoting

1410
01:20:17,885 --> 01:20:20,325
Speaker 15:  their artists and why we are all caught in the middle.

1411
01:20:32,925 --> 01:20:35,995
Speaker 7:  We're back. Do you remember when Time Magazine said the person of the year

1412
01:20:35,995 --> 01:20:37,595
Speaker 7:  was you? Ugh. Yeah.

1413
01:20:37,595 --> 01:20:41,435
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And it was the, the like little mirror. It was in a real mirror just

1414
01:20:41,435 --> 01:20:41,515
Speaker 5:  like

1415
01:20:41,665 --> 01:20:45,315
Speaker 7:  That was when print magazines had budget to put mirror on the cover of

1416
01:20:45,515 --> 01:20:48,155
Speaker 7:  magazines in every grocery store in America and be like, that person here

1417
01:20:48,155 --> 01:20:51,795
Speaker 7:  is you. you know, it was like a foggy people like holding their

1418
01:20:51,795 --> 01:20:52,635
Speaker 7:  carrots be like, what?

1419
01:20:53,015 --> 01:20:56,235
Speaker 5:  It was all like curvy warp looking. Oh

1420
01:20:56,235 --> 01:20:59,875
Speaker 7:  That's not me. I was here for milk, not conceptual print ideas.

1421
01:21:00,095 --> 01:21:00,515
Speaker 7:  So you're

1422
01:21:00,515 --> 01:21:04,435
Speaker 8:  Saying y'all didn't frame yours and put it up next to on the Wars? Is

1423
01:21:04,435 --> 01:21:06,875
Speaker 8:  that not that's not what you did. That's weird.

1424
01:21:07,255 --> 01:21:11,075
Speaker 7:  Donald Trump has like the fake one and I'm like, this

1425
01:21:11,085 --> 01:21:13,515
Speaker 7:  one's real like it's me, you guys.

1426
01:21:13,815 --> 01:21:15,475
Speaker 5:  He looks at it everywhere. Kidding.

1427
01:21:15,585 --> 01:21:19,555
Speaker 7:  It's like it's me. I was for real that time. Alright.

1428
01:21:20,435 --> 01:21:23,715
Speaker 7:  I feel like all of my lightning on it entries are just complaining about

1429
01:21:23,715 --> 01:21:26,035
Speaker 7:  streaming the super Bowl. So Cranz, do you wanna first

1430
01:21:26,425 --> 01:21:30,035
Speaker 5:  Mine is like, I just find it fascinating. The, the big

1431
01:21:30,415 --> 01:21:34,355
Speaker 5:  big turn in the, the whole DMA thing with the

1432
01:21:34,555 --> 01:21:38,515
Speaker 5:  European Union, iMessage is not found to be a,

1433
01:21:38,865 --> 01:21:42,835
Speaker 5:  what is it? They call it Gatekeeper. Yeah. I iMessage is not found to

1434
01:21:42,835 --> 01:21:46,675
Speaker 5:  be a core platform service so that you, they're not

1435
01:21:46,675 --> 01:21:50,555
Speaker 5:  gonna make it open up, which feels probably right given that no one in the

1436
01:21:50,755 --> 01:21:50,915
Speaker 5:  EU

1437
01:21:51,305 --> 01:21:55,035
Speaker 7:  Well this is the trade Apple. Yeah. They've notably made the trade of saying

1438
01:21:55,035 --> 01:21:58,945
Speaker 7:  we will support RCS and I think this is what they got in

1439
01:21:58,945 --> 01:21:59,185
Speaker 7:  return.

1440
01:21:59,575 --> 01:22:03,225
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So, so they're free and clear, as are my personal favorite.

1441
01:22:03,625 --> 01:22:06,585
Speaker 5:  Microsoft's Edge browser is not considered a core service

1442
01:22:07,525 --> 01:22:11,345
Speaker 5:  and Bing search was found to not be a core

1443
01:22:11,345 --> 01:22:11,585
Speaker 5:  service.

1444
01:22:11,825 --> 01:22:13,785
Speaker 7:  I don't think anybody has ever found Bing search to be a core service.

1445
01:22:13,945 --> 01:22:17,585
Speaker 5:  No, I I just, I really loved that it was like, okay, iMessage

1446
01:22:17,735 --> 01:22:21,025
Speaker 5:  like damn it and then Edge and then

1447
01:22:22,035 --> 01:22:22,485
Speaker 5:  Bing, you know,

1448
01:22:22,705 --> 01:22:26,645
Speaker 7:  Not even the bureaucrats of the European Union to bring themselves to regulate

1449
01:22:26,645 --> 01:22:26,925
Speaker 7:  Bing.

1450
01:22:27,125 --> 01:22:29,605
Speaker 5:  I wonder if they just like chuckled. They're like, oh no.

1451
01:22:32,105 --> 01:22:34,445
Speaker 7:  One thing that is really interesting in the mix there

1452
01:22:36,425 --> 01:22:39,605
Speaker 7:  is is Apple broke web apps in the EU.

1453
01:22:40,465 --> 01:22:43,685
Speaker 7:  So for a minute it looked like Apple would support what's called progressive

1454
01:22:43,685 --> 01:22:46,805
Speaker 7:  web apps in the iPhone where you have a web app, you can save it to your

1455
01:22:46,805 --> 01:22:50,645
Speaker 7:  home screen, you push the button, it loads up in a wrapper and it feels

1456
01:22:50,645 --> 01:22:54,525
Speaker 7:  just like an a normal app. This is great. Yeah. I think this is

1457
01:22:54,525 --> 01:22:56,965
Speaker 7:  like in terms of out, like

1458
01:22:57,025 --> 01:22:57,845
Speaker 5:  Out, that's how I do The.

1459
01:22:57,925 --> 01:23:00,645
Speaker 7:  Verge. Yeah. That's how I do The Verge. That's how I do our cms. When I want

1460
01:23:00,645 --> 01:23:03,645
Speaker 7:  to post a quick post really fast Ooh That's smart. A quick link that just

1461
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:07,445
Speaker 7:  opens up a web wrapper. It's not in safari. And Apple broke it two

1462
01:23:07,575 --> 01:23:11,205
Speaker 7:  betas ago in iOS 17 and they didn't say anything about why.

1463
01:23:11,785 --> 01:23:15,285
Speaker 7:  And then today they finally released a statement on their developer portal

1464
01:23:15,285 --> 01:23:19,125
Speaker 7:  that's like, well we have to support other browsers in iOS now their browser.

1465
01:23:19,585 --> 01:23:22,645
Speaker 7:  And as you know, they all have to be equal. So how could we possibly

1466
01:23:23,365 --> 01:23:26,845
Speaker 7:  re-architect all of iOS to support launching a web app and another browser

1467
01:23:26,845 --> 01:23:30,605
Speaker 7:  engine from the home screen. So we just shut it off and it's like, dude,

1468
01:23:30,795 --> 01:23:32,285
Speaker 7:  stop doing malicious compliance.

1469
01:23:32,355 --> 01:23:35,845
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like that was just like, like kicking and screaming. Like that's just

1470
01:23:35,885 --> 01:23:36,365
Speaker 5:  a hissy

1471
01:23:36,365 --> 01:23:39,805
Speaker 7:  Fit. Like do you know what platform supports PWAs and allows other browser

1472
01:23:39,805 --> 01:23:43,725
Speaker 7:  engines and Android? It's right there. Yeah, you can just look at

1473
01:23:43,725 --> 01:23:43,845
Speaker 7:  it.

1474
01:23:44,115 --> 01:23:45,245
Speaker 5:  It's just whiny. It's

1475
01:23:45,245 --> 01:23:47,845
Speaker 7:  Like don't be whiny. It's the most popular operating system on earth.

1476
01:23:48,115 --> 01:23:51,685
Speaker 8:  Meanwhile, the other browser makers have spent the last few weeks making

1477
01:23:51,715 --> 01:23:55,125
Speaker 8:  very clear to everyone that Apple has actually, if anything, made it harder

1478
01:23:55,185 --> 01:23:58,965
Speaker 8:  to be a browser maker in the EU now because you essentially have to run many

1479
01:23:58,965 --> 01:24:02,605
Speaker 8:  different versions of your app inside your one app and

1480
01:24:03,395 --> 01:24:05,605
Speaker 8:  it's just going to make everyone's life impossible.

1481
01:24:06,215 --> 01:24:07,165
Speaker 5:  Apple, come on,

1482
01:24:07,215 --> 01:24:07,965
Speaker 8:  Great job. Apple.

1483
01:24:08,275 --> 01:24:12,005
Speaker 7:  Look, we don't talk about this aspect of companies very often. We treat companies

1484
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:15,925
Speaker 7:  as sort of singular entities. There's a real split inside Apple right now

1485
01:24:16,195 --> 01:24:19,965
Speaker 7:  between the, the suits basically the policy and the

1486
01:24:20,125 --> 01:24:23,365
Speaker 7:  business folks and the very idealistic

1487
01:24:24,005 --> 01:24:27,725
Speaker 7:  engineers who make the products. Yeah. Yeah. And I think that that this

1488
01:24:27,965 --> 01:24:31,805
Speaker 7:  EU thing is really pushing on that split in a way that, you know, apple

1489
01:24:31,865 --> 01:24:35,725
Speaker 7:  is a very well run company. They're, they are mission driven in their

1490
01:24:35,725 --> 01:24:39,285
Speaker 7:  way. But I'm wondering how much of this stuff

1491
01:24:39,735 --> 01:24:42,605
Speaker 7:  where it's like a bunch of pretty bad faith responses

1492
01:24:44,165 --> 01:24:47,345
Speaker 7:  to a law that's designed to make computers feel more like computers. Yeah.

1493
01:24:48,165 --> 01:24:51,985
Speaker 7:  You just wonder, you know, like someone had to like write the code to

1494
01:24:51,985 --> 01:24:53,425
Speaker 7:  break all the web apps in the EU

1495
01:24:54,615 --> 01:24:58,385
Speaker 5:  Just like furiously Yeah. Just like, like suit standing over their shoulder.

1496
01:24:58,385 --> 01:25:01,305
Speaker 5:  Just like, I hate you so much right now, but I'm gonna write the really good

1497
01:25:01,305 --> 01:25:01,505
Speaker 5:  code.

1498
01:25:01,505 --> 01:25:04,425
Speaker 7:  Right? Like Yeah. Some lawyer is like do the malicious compliance. Yeah.

1499
01:25:04,645 --> 01:25:07,345
Speaker 7:  you know, and they like file the Jira ticket and the Jira ticket is just

1500
01:25:07,345 --> 01:25:11,305
Speaker 7:  labeled malicious compliance. That's kind of suck. That's all

1501
01:25:11,325 --> 01:25:13,905
Speaker 7:  I'm saying. Yeah. Like on the on on decoder, I'm always asking about how

1502
01:25:14,065 --> 01:25:16,985
Speaker 7:  decisions are made, but like how a decision actually gets implemented is

1503
01:25:16,985 --> 01:25:20,505
Speaker 7:  equally interesting to me. It's like someone had to file the Jira ticket.

1504
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:24,265
Speaker 7:  It's like per DMA break web apps that

1505
01:25:24,535 --> 01:25:24,825
Speaker 7:  just,

1506
01:25:24,825 --> 01:25:28,785
Speaker 8:  There's three levers in Tim Cook's office. one of them says ship the thing,

1507
01:25:29,325 --> 01:25:33,225
Speaker 8:  the other one says buy that company. And the third one just says

1508
01:25:33,465 --> 01:25:34,265
Speaker 8:  malicious compliance

1509
01:25:36,525 --> 01:25:40,065
Speaker 8:  and he just pulls it and just like lights start flashing all over Apple Park.

1510
01:25:40,165 --> 01:25:41,265
Speaker 8:  And that's how everybody knows.

1511
01:25:41,735 --> 01:25:44,465
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I don't know, there's something weird there that I, you know, I, again,

1512
01:25:44,465 --> 01:25:48,025
Speaker 7:  we usually think of companies as like singular entities. Yeah. Like there's

1513
01:25:48,025 --> 01:25:51,225
Speaker 7:  Tim Cook in the arms, you know, like and like Tim Cook is in control of all

1514
01:25:51,225 --> 01:25:54,265
Speaker 7:  the arms or the sooner we're try in arms and the arms are like, who are you

1515
01:25:54,455 --> 01:25:54,745
Speaker 7:  like,

1516
01:25:56,495 --> 01:26:00,425
Speaker 7:  like you made a messaging app. But these companies are tens of

1517
01:26:00,585 --> 01:26:03,725
Speaker 7:  thousands of people if not a hundred thousand people when they're at their

1518
01:26:03,725 --> 01:26:07,085
Speaker 7:  biggest Yeah. And they are not singular in that way. And I,

1519
01:26:07,675 --> 01:26:11,645
Speaker 7:  this is the sort of thing that I think I get that Apple's very mad at the

1520
01:26:11,765 --> 01:26:15,725
Speaker 7:  Europeans. My caution is this is the sort of thing that breaks a very idealistic

1521
01:26:15,725 --> 01:26:19,605
Speaker 7:  culture because you have to make everyone believe that you are totally

1522
01:26:19,605 --> 01:26:20,445
Speaker 7:  right. Yeah.

1523
01:26:20,445 --> 01:26:20,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1524
01:26:21,025 --> 01:26:24,805
Speaker 7:  And that this little move, which is not a very, which is a very

1525
01:26:24,965 --> 01:26:28,765
Speaker 7:  cynical kind of move, is actually is actually somehow idealistic in turn.

1526
01:26:29,145 --> 01:26:30,325
Speaker 7:  That's just complicated.

1527
01:26:30,475 --> 01:26:30,765
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1528
01:26:31,625 --> 01:26:34,445
Speaker 7:  All right. I basically did a lightning round under your lightning round,

1529
01:26:34,445 --> 01:26:34,925
Speaker 7:  but it was great but

1530
01:26:34,985 --> 01:26:38,485
Speaker 5:  It was good sub. Well yeah, we have like an aftershock, there's like a sub

1531
01:26:38,485 --> 01:26:39,245
Speaker 5:  lightning round under it.

1532
01:26:39,425 --> 01:26:41,725
Speaker 7:  You can sponsor an aftershock. I don't know if I take too.

1533
01:26:42,045 --> 01:26:42,605
Speaker 8:  I was just meant to

1534
01:26:42,605 --> 01:26:42,885
Speaker 7:  Say that.

1535
01:26:44,995 --> 01:26:46,205
Speaker 7:  Alright David, what's yours?

1536
01:26:47,235 --> 01:26:50,565
Speaker 8:  Mine, well I'm gonna, I'm gonna aftershock when we start complaining about

1537
01:26:50,565 --> 01:26:54,485
Speaker 8:  the super Bowl, so I'll come back to that. Mine was just, there was

1538
01:26:54,485 --> 01:26:58,045
Speaker 8:  this news this week from a Wall Street Journal report that Walmart might

1539
01:26:58,105 --> 01:27:01,565
Speaker 8:  buy Vizio. Yeah. Which I just find deeply

1540
01:27:02,165 --> 01:27:05,725
Speaker 8:  fascinating and also kind of to be a bummer. I feel like it wasn't that long

1541
01:27:05,745 --> 01:27:09,285
Speaker 8:  ago that we thought Vizio had a chance to be a really interesting forward

1542
01:27:09,285 --> 01:27:10,325
Speaker 8:  thinking player in

1543
01:27:10,585 --> 01:27:13,845
Speaker 7:  TVs. Yeah. That was 2011. I wrote a profile of Vizio in 2011. Was that

1544
01:27:13,845 --> 01:27:14,965
Speaker 8:  2011 was

1545
01:27:15,065 --> 01:27:16,445
Speaker 7:  It was like when we launched. Yeah,

1546
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:20,485
Speaker 5:  It was, it was was supposed to buy Visio what, 2017? Yeah. And then

1547
01:27:20,855 --> 01:27:22,845
Speaker 5:  after that it just kind of started to slow

1548
01:27:23,025 --> 01:27:24,725
Speaker 7:  The echo. I totally forgot. Remember

1549
01:27:25,315 --> 01:27:25,925
Speaker 8:  That fell

1550
01:27:25,925 --> 01:27:28,485
Speaker 5:  Apart And they came and they were like TV and then they disappeared and then

1551
01:27:28,525 --> 01:27:30,365
Speaker 5:  I could not get them to take the TV back. Didn't

1552
01:27:30,365 --> 01:27:31,325
Speaker 8:  They make a car at one point?

1553
01:27:31,945 --> 01:27:35,725
Speaker 7:  Yes. Yes. Yeah. That was a truly weird, yeah like, oh my God, that was just

1554
01:27:35,765 --> 01:27:37,605
Speaker 7:  a psyop. That was a Chinese government psyop.

1555
01:27:37,925 --> 01:27:40,285
Speaker 5:  I loved that company. That was a good time.

1556
01:27:41,025 --> 01:27:44,445
Speaker 7:  But anyway, but you remember the 2011 I wrote the profile Vizio. This guy

1557
01:27:44,445 --> 01:27:48,125
Speaker 7:  Matt McCrae was the CTO. He was a lot of fun. Do you remember they put out

1558
01:27:48,125 --> 01:27:50,925
Speaker 7:  Windows laptops and he kept saying they were bone stock. Oh yeah.

1559
01:27:51,905 --> 01:27:55,485
Speaker 7:  It was great. Loved that. All that was great. And they, they kept on trying

1560
01:27:55,485 --> 01:27:59,045
Speaker 7:  to expand by doing like fan service and the TV business was just their business.

1561
01:27:59,435 --> 01:28:01,525
Speaker 7:  Matt is now the CEO of Arlo cameras.

1562
01:28:03,665 --> 01:28:07,525
Speaker 7:  And I think physio is just like, really? They tried so many interesting

1563
01:28:07,525 --> 01:28:10,245
Speaker 7:  things. Remember when the TVs were just Chromecast? Yep.

1564
01:28:10,515 --> 01:28:12,605
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I I have one of those. Oh

1565
01:28:12,605 --> 01:28:14,125
Speaker 7:  Boy. But that's what everybody wanted

1566
01:28:15,425 --> 01:28:16,285
Speaker 5:  In practice.

1567
01:28:16,285 --> 01:28:16,685
Speaker 7:  This is like actually

1568
01:28:16,835 --> 01:28:17,125
Speaker 5:  They

1569
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:19,245
Speaker 8:  Had like reveal that was the remote,

1570
01:28:19,245 --> 01:28:21,725
Speaker 5:  Right? I know. Yeah. I don't know where it is if,

1571
01:28:21,945 --> 01:28:22,685
Speaker 7:  But this is what I mean about

1572
01:28:22,925 --> 01:28:24,045
Speaker 5:  Revealed s it's fired my house one day.

1573
01:28:24,405 --> 01:28:27,645
Speaker 7:  Everyone in our audience is like, I don't want a smart tv, I just want a

1574
01:28:27,645 --> 01:28:29,965
Speaker 7:  panel. The and then the like ship the thing.

1575
01:28:31,225 --> 01:28:34,605
Speaker 5:  But it had no remote. We wanted a remote. I still wanna be able to turn up

1576
01:28:34,605 --> 01:28:36,085
Speaker 5:  the volume without having to charge my

1577
01:28:36,085 --> 01:28:39,125
Speaker 7:  Damn. Everyone was like, I just want a dumb tv. I don't want da da da. And

1578
01:28:39,145 --> 01:28:41,565
Speaker 7:  and then they shipped it and they're like, no, I don't want that. Yeah, I

1579
01:28:41,565 --> 01:28:43,125
Speaker 7:  want giving a smart tv. I

1580
01:28:43,155 --> 01:28:46,725
Speaker 5:  Like the day the update came and I like, I I didn't even, it must've come

1581
01:28:46,745 --> 01:28:49,925
Speaker 5:  months in advance and I turned that TV on 'cause it's like my bedroom TV

1582
01:28:49,925 --> 01:28:53,845
Speaker 5:  so it's never on. Yeah. I turned it on and I was like, oh my Visio is smart

1583
01:28:53,945 --> 01:28:57,605
Speaker 5:  now And it was much more usable. Yeah. And then I was very upset 'cause I

1584
01:28:57,605 --> 01:29:00,765
Speaker 5:  was like, that wasn't the promise. Yeah. It got

1585
01:29:00,845 --> 01:29:04,285
Speaker 7:  Bummed, it revealed preferences man, everyone wants to run some weird data

1586
01:29:04,525 --> 01:29:06,485
Speaker 7:  tracking smart TV operating system. Yeah.

1587
01:29:08,225 --> 01:29:10,245
Speaker 7:  So $2 billion Walmart wants to buy Vizio.

1588
01:29:10,355 --> 01:29:13,845
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And it just feels like that's a lot of money

1589
01:29:14,275 --> 01:29:17,885
Speaker 8:  also to basically improve its house brand of

1590
01:29:18,065 --> 01:29:21,565
Speaker 8:  TVs, which is essentially what Walmart would be doing. Yeah. I would remind

1591
01:29:21,565 --> 01:29:25,045
Speaker 8:  you that it's existing House brand is called on with two ends.

1592
01:29:25,395 --> 01:29:29,325
Speaker 8:  Yeah. So I would spend $2 billion to not have on with two ends as my

1593
01:29:29,325 --> 01:29:30,645
Speaker 8:  house brand of anything like

1594
01:29:31,095 --> 01:29:35,045
Speaker 5:  Vizio Hass kind of gotten embodied by TCL in, in high sense in the last

1595
01:29:35,045 --> 01:29:37,725
Speaker 5:  few years in the budget TV market. So it's Yeah, like

1596
01:29:37,725 --> 01:29:40,645
Speaker 8:  What a bleak statement though, right? Yeah. Like that like the fact that

1597
01:29:40,645 --> 01:29:44,285
Speaker 8:  that is true and that is true. Yeah. Is so, it's such a bummer.

1598
01:29:44,355 --> 01:29:47,325
Speaker 5:  It's so yeah. The place the TV market is right now go from like,

1599
01:29:48,225 --> 01:29:51,925
Speaker 5:  it was such a good company because okay, you could get the TV in and it wouldn't

1600
01:29:51,925 --> 01:29:55,205
Speaker 5:  necessarily be like, like you'd have to fiddle with it. You'd have to mess

1601
01:29:55,205 --> 01:29:58,165
Speaker 5:  around, but then it could look really, really pretty and you'd be like, oh

1602
01:29:58,215 --> 01:30:02,045
Speaker 5:  Helly crap. I spent like half of what I could have spent on an LG and I have

1603
01:30:02,045 --> 01:30:05,925
Speaker 5:  a great looking TV and now that's just not quite the

1604
01:30:05,925 --> 01:30:06,725
Speaker 5:  case anymore.

1605
01:30:06,855 --> 01:30:10,645
Speaker 8:  First and now the whole TV business is collecting data on people who watch

1606
01:30:10,645 --> 01:30:14,445
Speaker 8:  you while you put up your webcam. The first Yeah. Vizio

1607
01:30:14,445 --> 01:30:16,285
Speaker 8:  is is has been doing that being

1608
01:30:16,285 --> 01:30:19,485
Speaker 5:  Sued. Yeah. Like Vizio is, Vizio was a, was a really

1609
01:30:20,565 --> 01:30:24,485
Speaker 5:  a thought leader in that department for a while there. Unfortunate

1610
01:30:24,485 --> 01:30:25,085
Speaker 5:  for all of us.

1611
01:30:25,475 --> 01:30:28,125
Speaker 7:  Well that's how they made the TVs cheap. I mean this was Yeah. Yeah.

1612
01:30:28,475 --> 01:30:31,165
Speaker 5:  That was their sub. Like they, they essentially subsidized it and, and, and

1613
01:30:31,165 --> 01:30:34,925
Speaker 5:  then Roku came in and was like, we can do it better because

1614
01:30:35,505 --> 01:30:39,405
Speaker 5:  our, our operating system is actually usable. And, and

1615
01:30:39,405 --> 01:30:42,405
Speaker 5:  that's why Roku like partnered with Hisense. That's why they partnered with

1616
01:30:42,405 --> 01:30:46,085
Speaker 5:  with TCL and, and now Roku is this really dominant

1617
01:30:46,095 --> 01:30:50,005
Speaker 5:  force in advertising and in TVs And Vizio

1618
01:30:50,005 --> 01:30:52,845
Speaker 5:  is off in the corner being like, let go. I blame you for every

1619
01:30:53,515 --> 01:30:56,605
Speaker 8:  Well Roku also came to people and said, we have an advertising business that

1620
01:30:56,605 --> 01:31:00,245
Speaker 8:  we'll give you a cut of. And that has become a business for Walmart

1621
01:31:00,395 --> 01:31:04,325
Speaker 8:  that it thinks it can do more like it's just all, this is a lot

1622
01:31:04,325 --> 01:31:07,365
Speaker 8:  of money being thrown around for big deals and big companies and none of

1623
01:31:07,365 --> 01:31:09,925
Speaker 8:  it is about making good televisions. And that just sucks.

1624
01:31:10,275 --> 01:31:10,805
Speaker 5:  That sucks.

1625
01:31:11,385 --> 01:31:13,245
Speaker 7:  You know, it's a great television. It's Sony 8 9 5

1626
01:31:13,835 --> 01:31:15,525
Speaker 8:  That watches you while you're,

1627
01:31:15,925 --> 01:31:18,485
Speaker 7:  I trying to watch tv I the camera and I turned all this stuff off

1628
01:31:18,505 --> 01:31:21,085
Speaker 5:  Was like, try to do it another meeting with that tv. Tell us how great it's,

1629
01:31:21,085 --> 01:31:21,325
Speaker 5:  it's not

1630
01:31:21,325 --> 01:31:25,205
Speaker 7:  Gonna happen. We're we're done messing with the features of the

1631
01:31:25,205 --> 01:31:26,325
Speaker 7:  television. Did you have to like

1632
01:31:26,345 --> 01:31:28,525
Speaker 5:  Go and put the webcam back in a box? Oh

1633
01:31:28,525 --> 01:31:32,485
Speaker 7:  I, the webcam was just like quickly discarded. Yeah I've got like, I've

1634
01:31:32,485 --> 01:31:35,445
Speaker 7:  got a drawer that I just think of as the e-waste drawer. Yeah. And it's like

1635
01:31:35,445 --> 01:31:38,405
Speaker 7:  maybe one day I'll be like, where is that webcam and I'm gonna open the EWA

1636
01:31:38,405 --> 01:31:39,165
Speaker 7:  drawer. It's gonna be great.

1637
01:31:39,965 --> 01:31:41,565
Speaker 8:  Speaking of, let's complain about the Super Bowl.

1638
01:31:42,715 --> 01:31:46,445
Speaker 7:  Alright. I have a lot to say about this whole situation.

1639
01:31:49,145 --> 01:31:53,125
Speaker 7:  It is an embarrassment that in America on the

1640
01:31:53,155 --> 01:31:55,045
Speaker 7:  most washed super Bowl ever Oh

1641
01:31:55,045 --> 01:31:55,285
Speaker 8:  Lord.

1642
01:31:55,895 --> 01:31:57,605
Speaker 7:  Where America's sweetheart

1643
01:31:59,155 --> 01:32:01,735
Speaker 7:  did something with Travis Kelsey on that field. She won the super Bowl, she

1644
01:32:01,735 --> 01:32:04,655
Speaker 7:  won the super Bowl. Actually can I just say this other, you know there's

1645
01:32:04,655 --> 01:32:07,935
Speaker 7:  a video clip of them running to each other after the super Bowl and she like

1646
01:32:07,935 --> 01:32:10,455
Speaker 7:  hug each other and then finally the clip with the audio came out 'cause he

1647
01:32:10,455 --> 01:32:13,615
Speaker 7:  was micd up. Yeah. And he is like, I love you, thank you for coming. I appreciate

1648
01:32:13,615 --> 01:32:16,815
Speaker 7:  you. Thank you for flying halfway around in the world. And then he says,

1649
01:32:18,055 --> 01:32:20,475
Speaker 7:  was it Electric? And she's like, it was unbelievable.

1650
01:32:22,155 --> 01:32:26,115
Speaker 7:  I have asked Becky if shit was Electric like 50 times a day

1651
01:32:26,525 --> 01:32:29,675
Speaker 7:  since I've seen that clip. Like I'm like pouring the coffee. Like was it

1652
01:32:29,915 --> 01:32:33,555
Speaker 7:  Electric easily the best thing to come outta the entire Taylor Swift Travis

1653
01:32:33,555 --> 01:32:36,875
Speaker 7:  Kelsey story for me. Fantastic. It's just constantly asking Becky if things

1654
01:32:36,875 --> 01:32:40,835
Speaker 7:  are and she's like, no, she's, she does not think

1655
01:32:40,835 --> 01:32:41,675
Speaker 7:  it was unbelievable.

1656
01:32:41,855 --> 01:32:43,635
Speaker 5:  She shut down immediately.

1657
01:32:44,015 --> 01:32:47,275
Speaker 7:  No. Anyway, so, so you were not streamed in

1658
01:32:47,385 --> 01:32:51,315
Speaker 7:  4K but kind of streamed 4K So I Paramount Plus I think David, that's

1659
01:32:51,315 --> 01:32:52,515
Speaker 7:  where you watched it. That is where I

1660
01:32:52,515 --> 01:32:53,475
Speaker 8:  Watched it. That's

1661
01:32:53,475 --> 01:32:55,195
Speaker 5:  Where I watched 30 minutes of it.

1662
01:32:56,665 --> 01:33:00,035
Speaker 7:  They only gave a 4K stream to cable companies.

1663
01:33:01,025 --> 01:33:04,685
Speaker 7:  So nothing direct from CBS. So If you had cable or

1664
01:33:04,835 --> 01:33:08,325
Speaker 7:  DirecTV, you could switch to a 4K

1665
01:33:08,445 --> 01:33:11,865
Speaker 7:  CBS channel, which was upscaled 10 80

1666
01:33:12,025 --> 01:33:15,145
Speaker 7:  PHDR. So it already looked weird.

1667
01:33:16,605 --> 01:33:19,905
Speaker 7:  one of the most vibrant cable companies in America is YouTube.

1668
01:33:20,725 --> 01:33:24,265
Speaker 7:  So you YouTube tv, you can pay for the 4K add-on which I turned off of ages

1669
01:33:24,265 --> 01:33:27,985
Speaker 7:  ago 'cause it was not worth it. So I paid the 10 bucks for

1670
01:33:27,985 --> 01:33:31,825
Speaker 7:  4K for the month and I go to watch it and the

1671
01:33:32,065 --> 01:33:35,905
Speaker 7:  bit rate keeps crashing on YouTube tv just like I'm watching my

1672
01:33:35,905 --> 01:33:39,745
Speaker 7:  router. It starts, you know, like, yeah, 15 or 20 or whatever the 4K

1673
01:33:39,745 --> 01:33:43,505
Speaker 7:  stream would be at not even that high. It's like eight and then it just

1674
01:33:44,305 --> 01:33:48,145
Speaker 7:  like, just dropped like a stone. That's brutal. And I

1675
01:33:48,145 --> 01:33:52,025
Speaker 7:  kept switching back to the 10 80 p feed on CBS and it looked great. Why didn't

1676
01:33:52,025 --> 01:33:53,105
Speaker 7:  you switch over So? I saw my internet

1677
01:33:53,565 --> 01:33:54,905
Speaker 5:  Switch over to Nickelodeon.

1678
01:33:55,865 --> 01:33:57,185
Speaker 7:  Everyone told me Nickelodeon stream looked great.

1679
01:33:57,285 --> 01:34:00,785
Speaker 5:  It was a, it looked beautiful. Yeah. Dora the explorer explained what illegal

1680
01:34:00,785 --> 01:34:02,505
Speaker 5:  holding is. Fantastic. And now I

1681
01:34:02,505 --> 01:34:05,105
Speaker 7:  Know and at the end they, they slimed everyone I believe on the feed. Yeah,

1682
01:34:05,205 --> 01:34:09,145
Speaker 7:  it was good. Just a disaster. And some people thought

1683
01:34:09,145 --> 01:34:12,665
Speaker 7:  it was working great, but I post on threads like this bit rate keeps crashing

1684
01:34:13,205 --> 01:34:17,065
Speaker 7:  and too many people agreed with me. Yeah. That it was a bad experience for

1685
01:34:17,065 --> 01:34:20,985
Speaker 7:  me to think that it was like my internet. I switched from the Apple

1686
01:34:21,125 --> 01:34:24,385
Speaker 7:  tv, YouTube TV app to the Android app on the Sony tv

1687
01:34:25,465 --> 01:34:29,305
Speaker 7:  assuming Google would, you know, like a good gatekeeper. Yeah. Would preference

1688
01:34:29,365 --> 01:34:32,665
Speaker 7:  its own service on its own operating system. It worked for slightly longer.

1689
01:34:32,765 --> 01:34:36,425
Speaker 7:  It worked for five minutes before it crashed but then it, then it crashed.

1690
01:34:36,615 --> 01:34:38,905
Speaker 8:  Well we hope it will make sense over time. Eli

1691
01:34:40,085 --> 01:34:43,865
Speaker 5:  Is Max Sports or whatever this new super sports streaming service

1692
01:34:43,865 --> 01:34:47,745
Speaker 5:  called, is that gonna save the super Bowl once

1693
01:34:47,745 --> 01:34:48,505
Speaker 5:  it once out

1694
01:34:48,505 --> 01:34:49,985
Speaker 7:  The super Bowl does not need to be saved. Well,

1695
01:34:49,985 --> 01:34:53,025
Speaker 5:  You know, like save it from bad streaming experiences.

1696
01:34:53,425 --> 01:34:57,165
Speaker 7:  I I just think it is fundamentally embarrassing that we as a

1697
01:34:57,165 --> 01:35:01,045
Speaker 7:  nation cannot figure this out. Look, you go to watch soccer

1698
01:35:01,385 --> 01:35:05,365
Speaker 7:  in in England and they're like, it's 10 4K feeds anywhere

1699
01:35:05,365 --> 01:35:09,125
Speaker 7:  you want to be. It's free. And also there's free healthcare and like what

1700
01:35:09,125 --> 01:35:09,485
Speaker 7:  are we doing?

1701
01:35:10,185 --> 01:35:13,645
Speaker 5:  As you said that I saw like an American flag drop behind you and I just like

1702
01:35:13,935 --> 01:35:15,725
Speaker 5:  heard the, the the American music.

1703
01:35:16,065 --> 01:35:18,525
Speaker 7:  Oh yeah. Someone's getting mad at me for not being sufficiently patriotic

1704
01:35:18,525 --> 01:35:20,325
Speaker 7:  that we have to watch upscale 10 80 p No,

1705
01:35:20,325 --> 01:35:22,325
Speaker 5:  No. I thought that was the most patriotic thing I've seen

1706
01:35:22,325 --> 01:35:24,685
Speaker 7:  In a while. You have to figure this out. Fix the super

1707
01:35:24,835 --> 01:35:28,725
Speaker 5:  Bowl. I also, speaking of, of sports, I, I made a, a

1708
01:35:28,725 --> 01:35:32,285
Speaker 5:  big gaff last week because I, I mistakenly said that

1709
01:35:32,585 --> 01:35:36,085
Speaker 5:  Fox sports channels are owned by Disney

1710
01:35:36,625 --> 01:35:40,565
Speaker 5:  and that is only true and I believe Argentina in some parts of South America,

1711
01:35:40,785 --> 01:35:41,205
Speaker 5:  that's

1712
01:35:41,205 --> 01:35:42,365
Speaker 8:  Where all the listeners are. It's fine.

1713
01:35:42,365 --> 01:35:46,165
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It is not owned by Disney in

1714
01:35:46,475 --> 01:35:49,565
Speaker 5:  America where it is owned by Fox.

1715
01:35:49,665 --> 01:35:51,045
Speaker 7:  Fox, right. Rupert Murdoch. Yeah.

1716
01:35:51,045 --> 01:35:54,605
Speaker 5:  It's it's still owned by Rupert. I, I forgot but but Disney does own it.

1717
01:35:54,635 --> 01:35:56,965
Speaker 5:  Just, just not in this country.

1718
01:35:58,585 --> 01:35:59,365
Speaker 5:  I'm sorry. I would

1719
01:35:59,365 --> 01:36:02,365
Speaker 8:  Just like to say two things about that. One, we screwed that up and it was

1720
01:36:02,395 --> 01:36:03,085
Speaker 8:  complicated.

1721
01:36:03,145 --> 01:36:04,685
Speaker 5:  It was very embarrassing. I was annoyed. But

1722
01:36:04,785 --> 01:36:08,685
Speaker 8:  Two, it makes this whole thing even funnier because it now is even more

1723
01:36:08,685 --> 01:36:10,125
Speaker 8:  like Hulu. It is

1724
01:36:10,125 --> 01:36:10,365
Speaker 7:  Three

1725
01:36:10,985 --> 01:36:14,165
Speaker 8:  Direct competitors being like, let's be best friends. We'll figure this out.

1726
01:36:14,275 --> 01:36:15,765
Speaker 8:  Yeah, it's fantastic.

1727
01:36:16,035 --> 01:36:18,645
Speaker 5:  It's so good. And, and If you, it's also very funny, If, you go and look

1728
01:36:18,645 --> 01:36:22,005
Speaker 5:  at Fox Sports on like the Wikipedia page and it says current owners and there's

1729
01:36:22,005 --> 01:36:25,525
Speaker 5:  a list of like six current owners depending on what region you're in. I was

1730
01:36:25,525 --> 01:36:25,605
Speaker 5:  like,

1731
01:36:26,345 --> 01:36:27,685
Speaker 7:  That's good. Help out.

1732
01:36:27,685 --> 01:36:31,245
Speaker 5:  Come on Fox. Like just one company owned the company,

1733
01:36:31,345 --> 01:36:31,765
Speaker 5:  please.

1734
01:36:32,105 --> 01:36:35,725
Speaker 7:  No, that's not Ripper's breaking up his empire. Yeah. And by the way, you

1735
01:36:35,725 --> 01:36:39,605
Speaker 7:  need Fox Sports because you have to have Fox Sports because of football.

1736
01:36:40,485 --> 01:36:41,325
Speaker 5:  I mean I don't but

1737
01:36:41,425 --> 01:36:44,125
Speaker 7:  But look, the cable companies do. Oh yeah, that's true. And to get Fox sports,

1738
01:36:44,125 --> 01:36:46,885
Speaker 7:  you have to carry Fox News. Right. That's a real thing. They leverage each

1739
01:36:46,885 --> 01:36:47,445
Speaker 7:  other. Fox News.

1740
01:36:48,285 --> 01:36:48,525
Speaker 5:  I mean, it

1741
01:36:48,645 --> 01:36:51,445
Speaker 7:  Is like, I have a lot of feelings about Fox News, Fox D's on its own popular,

1742
01:36:52,305 --> 01:36:53,645
Speaker 7:  but they are a bundle deal.

1743
01:36:53,715 --> 01:36:54,845
Speaker 8:  Yeah. They are unstoppable.

1744
01:36:55,025 --> 01:36:58,325
Speaker 7:  You can't get football without taking the other thing. Yeah. That's not,

1745
01:36:58,325 --> 01:37:01,725
Speaker 7:  that's not a choice for you. Right. Which many cable operators have always

1746
01:37:01,725 --> 01:37:05,405
Speaker 7:  sort of like been aware of. Yeah. That's America. Yeah.

1747
01:37:05,645 --> 01:37:07,925
Speaker 7:  All I'm saying is we could stream it in forehand. How was Paramount Plus,

1748
01:37:08,005 --> 01:37:08,925
Speaker 7:  I know you watched on Paramount Plus.

1749
01:37:08,925 --> 01:37:12,765
Speaker 8:  Okay. I would just like to briefly complain about this. I try not to use

1750
01:37:13,105 --> 01:37:16,965
Speaker 8:  The Verge as a place to be annoyed at customer service things. But

1751
01:37:16,965 --> 01:37:19,845
Speaker 8:  Paramount plus sucked for me during the Super Bowl and I'm very upset about

1752
01:37:19,845 --> 01:37:23,725
Speaker 8:  it. So for a while it just didn't work at all. It would throw up

1753
01:37:23,725 --> 01:37:27,685
Speaker 8:  like a mysterious, a bad thing happened, we don't know, try again.

1754
01:37:28,005 --> 01:37:30,725
Speaker 8:  And then I would try again and it wouldn't work. But eventually it worked

1755
01:37:30,725 --> 01:37:33,645
Speaker 8:  and it actually streamed fine and looked fine. But this incredible thing

1756
01:37:33,645 --> 01:37:37,405
Speaker 8:  kept happening, which is that the audio would get about

1757
01:37:37,405 --> 01:37:41,365
Speaker 8:  eight seconds ahead of the video. And so literally

1758
01:37:41,375 --> 01:37:44,965
Speaker 8:  every single time the play would've just finished

1759
01:37:45,425 --> 01:37:49,365
Speaker 8:  before I saw the play. So Jim Nance would be like shouting about how

1760
01:37:49,365 --> 01:37:53,005
Speaker 8:  Brandon IU caught it for 20 yards, right. As their snapping ball.

1761
01:37:53,425 --> 01:37:57,245
Speaker 8:  It made it so unpleasant to watch this game. It was like So, I literal,

1762
01:37:57,245 --> 01:37:59,605
Speaker 8:  literally stopped looking at it for a while. I was like, I'm gonna listen

1763
01:37:59,605 --> 01:38:03,525
Speaker 8:  to this like it's radio and Tony Romos just gonna say nonsensical

1764
01:38:03,525 --> 01:38:07,365
Speaker 8:  things at me. but it was just, I kept, I would like p

1765
01:38:07,465 --> 01:38:10,325
Speaker 8:  try to pause and you can't because it's live and it's illegal to pause things

1766
01:38:10,325 --> 01:38:14,005
Speaker 8:  or something. I would go out of the app and come back in and it would work

1767
01:38:14,005 --> 01:38:17,925
Speaker 8:  fine. And then go back to being off by about the same amount. I rebooted

1768
01:38:17,925 --> 01:38:21,325
Speaker 8:  my TV at one point. I did the whole Roku reboot at one point.

1769
01:38:21,425 --> 01:38:22,325
Speaker 7:  That's bad. Oh,

1770
01:38:22,325 --> 01:38:23,845
Speaker 5:  You were on a Roku. See there was your problem.

1771
01:38:24,095 --> 01:38:27,765
Speaker 7:  Those letters bouncing at you when you wanna watch TV and, and it's like,

1772
01:38:27,765 --> 01:38:28,165
Speaker 7:  do do.

1773
01:38:28,305 --> 01:38:28,845
Speaker 8:  Oh my gosh.

1774
01:38:29,185 --> 01:38:31,645
Speaker 5:  You like, you got your food right in front of you. Nightmare.

1775
01:38:32,155 --> 01:38:34,965
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I'm telling you, watching those letters bounce when you reboot a Roku

1776
01:38:34,965 --> 01:38:37,245
Speaker 7:  and you're just trying to get there. And was there anyone else in the room

1777
01:38:37,245 --> 01:38:39,125
Speaker 7:  with you? It's like they're taunting you. Yeah.

1778
01:38:40,045 --> 01:38:43,405
Speaker 5:  I also think this was also a little bit like Paramount was getting back at

1779
01:38:43,405 --> 01:38:46,285
Speaker 5:  David particularly because he makes fun of how much I enjoy Paramount. Plus

1780
01:38:46,445 --> 01:38:49,525
Speaker 8:  I have said a lot mean things about Paramount plus So. I did deserve this.

1781
01:38:49,795 --> 01:38:53,765
Speaker 8:  Yeah. But like, we're square now. Paramount little car. Listen, Sherry Redstone,

1782
01:38:53,895 --> 01:38:54,365
Speaker 8:  we're cool.

1783
01:38:54,465 --> 01:38:58,405
Speaker 7:  Now What, what, what, what heartened me was the number of people

1784
01:38:58,405 --> 01:39:01,285
Speaker 7:  responding to my complaints about streaming sports and internet by telling

1785
01:39:01,285 --> 01:39:04,965
Speaker 7:  me to get an antenna. And I thought of you Alex. Aw. I did not dig out.

1786
01:39:04,965 --> 01:39:07,605
Speaker 7:  Antenna with, yeah. 15 people in my home.

1787
01:39:08,875 --> 01:39:12,685
Speaker 7:  Like I've already switched operating systems. I'm, we're not doing

1788
01:39:12,715 --> 01:39:14,845
Speaker 7:  antenna up runs right now. That's

1789
01:39:14,845 --> 01:39:15,645
Speaker 5:  Great. It's a good time.

1790
01:39:15,885 --> 01:39:18,605
Speaker 7:  We did watch the halftime show at the low bit rate, 'cause I couldn't switch

1791
01:39:18,605 --> 01:39:20,165
Speaker 7:  it to the other stream in the middle. Did

1792
01:39:20,165 --> 01:39:21,365
Speaker 5:  You watch Apple? Oh, can I complain

1793
01:39:21,365 --> 01:39:24,645
Speaker 8:  About another version about Paramount Plus? Yeah. Yeah. So I,

1794
01:39:25,355 --> 01:39:29,245
Speaker 8:  like the genius that I am, opened up Paramount Plus,

1795
01:39:29,455 --> 01:39:33,445
Speaker 8:  after one of my many reboots clicked on the thing that said the

1796
01:39:33,605 --> 01:39:37,005
Speaker 8:  football game, and it took me to a separate channel where they were talking

1797
01:39:37,005 --> 01:39:39,765
Speaker 8:  about the football game. So I was like, oh, this is just the halftime show

1798
01:39:40,145 --> 01:39:43,245
Speaker 8:  before the thing. And then Anna, my wife gets a text from her friend being

1799
01:39:43,245 --> 01:39:46,925
Speaker 8:  like, oh, are you watching Usher? He's sick. And I'm sitting there telling

1800
01:39:46,985 --> 01:39:50,005
Speaker 8:  her that it must not have started yet. And it turns out that when I clicked

1801
01:39:50,005 --> 01:39:53,205
Speaker 8:  on football, it didn't click on football. It clicked on something else for

1802
01:39:53,205 --> 01:39:56,765
Speaker 8:  me. And didn't So I missed like three quarters of Usher because it didn't

1803
01:39:56,765 --> 01:39:58,365
Speaker 8:  select the thing that it was supposed to select.

1804
01:39:58,505 --> 01:40:00,925
Speaker 5:  You. You can watch it on the Apple TV app.

1805
01:40:01,385 --> 01:40:02,325
Speaker 7:  You're doing great, David.

1806
01:40:03,105 --> 01:40:03,885
Speaker 8:  I'm still angry.

1807
01:40:04,405 --> 01:40:07,805
Speaker 7:  I feel like a lot of your choices are your fault. Like my

1808
01:40:08,045 --> 01:40:10,365
Speaker 8:  Archer took his shirt off NELI and I missed it. I

1809
01:40:10,365 --> 01:40:11,725
Speaker 7:  Missed it. My You did, you did.

1810
01:40:11,805 --> 01:40:13,205
Speaker 8:  I did see the roller skates though, so it was

1811
01:40:13,205 --> 01:40:14,725
Speaker 5:  Okay. The roller skates were sick. Yeah.

1812
01:40:15,105 --> 01:40:16,725
Speaker 7:  Can I just say it was Electric?

1813
01:40:25,645 --> 01:40:29,525
Speaker 7:  I wanna just do a Quick Atmos music update for everyone. We installed

1814
01:40:29,525 --> 01:40:32,925
Speaker 7:  the big home theater. Yeah. In our house. It's done. Or we,

1815
01:40:33,665 --> 01:40:36,605
Speaker 7:  if you've been listening to Virtual House since September when we moved into

1816
01:40:36,605 --> 01:40:40,125
Speaker 7:  our new house in the background has been construction sounds every time I

1817
01:40:40,125 --> 01:40:43,965
Speaker 7:  record from my house. 'cause we've just been renovating. It's done now.

1818
01:40:44,995 --> 01:40:47,445
Speaker 7:  Only two things that need to be done. Who knows if they'll ever get done,

1819
01:40:47,625 --> 01:40:51,165
Speaker 7:  but the, it's done and the TVs are done and we have a 5.1 0.4

1820
01:40:51,415 --> 01:40:55,325
Speaker 7:  Atmos system. It's, it's cool. Yeah, I like it. And

1821
01:40:55,325 --> 01:40:59,285
Speaker 7:  So I texted a friend who believes in Atmos music more than

1822
01:40:59,325 --> 01:41:02,605
Speaker 7:  I do. And I said, this is as much of a chance as I can ever give

1823
01:41:03,115 --> 01:41:07,085
Speaker 7:  this boondoggle. And he sent me a list of things to listen to. Random

1824
01:41:07,085 --> 01:41:10,965
Speaker 7:  Access Memories by Def Punk, the Dua Lipa record

1825
01:41:12,445 --> 01:41:15,725
Speaker 7:  a bunch of other stuff. And So I like listened to it. I was also told that

1826
01:41:15,745 --> 01:41:19,415
Speaker 7:  Amazon music is better. It's, it, they, their

1827
01:41:19,425 --> 01:41:22,815
Speaker 7:  codec is better than Apple. So I. I compare, I'm doing my best. Yeah.

1828
01:41:23,035 --> 01:41:24,215
Speaker 7:  Really running into ground

1829
01:41:26,125 --> 01:41:27,905
Speaker 7:  two things I've discovered. One,

1830
01:41:29,465 --> 01:41:33,365
Speaker 7:  the only idea anyone has is putting percussion

1831
01:41:34,315 --> 01:41:35,365
Speaker 7:  accents behind you.

1832
01:41:37,035 --> 01:41:40,445
Speaker 7:  Like someone cowbell, someone rings a cowbell and it's like, behind you,

1833
01:41:41,035 --> 01:41:44,965
Speaker 7:  it's like, like every song with anything like that. Like a Tom Phil

1834
01:41:46,505 --> 01:41:49,965
Speaker 7:  that's going around you. And that's, that's what we got. Yeah. And we've

1835
01:41:50,285 --> 01:41:53,965
Speaker 7:  solved that problem. Like in the manual of how to remix a song for Atmos.

1836
01:41:54,315 --> 01:41:57,405
Speaker 7:  It's like, if there's any sort of percussion accent,

1837
01:41:58,705 --> 01:42:02,685
Speaker 7:  get it back there. Two, and I've been joking about this

1838
01:42:02,785 --> 01:42:06,705
Speaker 7:  for, I want to say over a year in the Atmos remix

1839
01:42:06,705 --> 01:42:08,265
Speaker 7:  of Come Together by the Beatles.

1840
01:42:09,805 --> 01:42:12,625
Speaker 7:  George Harrison sneaks up behind you playing the guitar.

1841
01:42:14,015 --> 01:42:17,865
Speaker 7:  This is your dream. You've been waiting for this. Was it Slow Sneak, was

1842
01:42:17,865 --> 01:42:20,985
Speaker 7:  it? No, it, yeah, it, it, it, it's at the very end.

1843
01:42:21,765 --> 01:42:24,625
Speaker 7:  you know, there's like little, just like a little guitar like Yeah. Happening

1844
01:42:24,655 --> 01:42:28,465
Speaker 7:  come together and it starts behind you and then it comes

1845
01:42:28,465 --> 01:42:31,785
Speaker 7:  in front of you. It was like he was in the room with you. Like each successive

1846
01:42:31,785 --> 01:42:35,185
Speaker 7:  one gets closer and closer and then it's in front of you at the end. And

1847
01:42:35,365 --> 01:42:38,745
Speaker 7:  you have to understand, I'm like, I'm like listening to this at like 11:45 PM

1848
01:42:38,915 --> 01:42:42,825
Speaker 7:  alone. Just cracking up, just

1849
01:42:42,825 --> 01:42:46,705
Speaker 7:  losing my mind. Like, this is the funniest thing that's happened. It's so,

1850
01:42:46,895 --> 01:42:50,545
Speaker 7:  it's just like me rewinding come together over and over again and be like,

1851
01:42:50,765 --> 01:42:51,425
Speaker 7:  no, that's real.

1852
01:42:53,015 --> 01:42:56,945
Speaker 7:  It's very good. I encourage everyone to listen to it. The we we're

1853
01:42:56,945 --> 01:42:59,825
Speaker 7:  done here at Atmos has been completed. You've solved it.

1854
01:43:00,885 --> 01:43:01,985
Speaker 7:  It actually happened.

1855
01:43:04,055 --> 01:43:07,025
Speaker 7:  It's, it's, it's very funny. This is huge for, you know, it's like deeply

1856
01:43:07,025 --> 01:43:10,385
Speaker 7:  meaningfully funny. If you know of any other

1857
01:43:10,835 --> 01:43:14,785
Speaker 7:  songs where the guitar player sneaks up from you, please let

1858
01:43:14,785 --> 01:43:18,145
Speaker 7:  me know. It is my now my Go-to demo song.
