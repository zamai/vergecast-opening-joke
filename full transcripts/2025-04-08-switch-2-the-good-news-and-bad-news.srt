Description: Last week, The Verge's Ash Parrish got to play with the new Nintendo Switch 2. We got over our outrageous jealousy long enough to ask her all about it: what it's like to hold, how the screen looks, whether the mouse-control is any good, and much more. Ash gives us the good news, and the bad news, on everything we now know about the Switch 2. (We do talk about the price, but we recorded before the Trump administration launched its massive new tariff push — so you can consider the price even worse news than we thought.) After that, The Verge's Tom Warren joins the show to talk about Microsoft's 50th anniversary celebration, how the company has stayed so resilient for so long, and whether AI is really the next five-decade project for one of the world's biggest companies. Finally, we answer a question on the Vergecast Hotline (866-VERGE11, or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about how you should change your shopping habits in a tariff-filled world. It's hard to know where we'll be in a few months, but it sure doesn't look like gadgets are getting any cheaper.


2
00:01:34,265 --> 00:01:38,025
Speaker 2:  I also wanna know what those games are for you. I, I sort of immediately

3
00:01:38,025 --> 00:01:41,145
Speaker 2:  regret asking this because if I have like two more of these in my life, I'm

4
00:01:41,145 --> 00:01:44,345
Speaker 2:  just never gonna get anything done again. But I wanna know what are the games

5
00:01:44,345 --> 00:01:48,105
Speaker 2:  that for you, you can, like, you sit down at at two o'clock

6
00:01:48,405 --> 00:01:50,625
Speaker 2:  and you're like, I'm gonna play a little bit of this game, and then suddenly

7
00:01:50,655 --> 00:01:53,785
Speaker 2:  it's seven and you're like, how am I still playing this game? I didn't, how

8
00:01:53,785 --> 00:01:57,025
Speaker 2:  has it been? Five hours? Those are the games I wanna know about. Email us

9
00:01:57,225 --> 00:02:00,745
Speaker 2:  vergecast to The Verge dot com. Call us eight six six VERGE one one.

10
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:04,185
Speaker 2:  I wanna hear everything. Tell me everything. Anyway, that's not what we're

11
00:02:04,185 --> 00:02:08,145
Speaker 2:  here to do on this show today. We are gonna do two things. First, we're

12
00:02:08,145 --> 00:02:11,985
Speaker 2:  gonna talk to Ash Parrish about the Nintendo Switch too. She was there,

13
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:14,825
Speaker 2:  she was in New York Last week. She's seen the Switch two, she's played the

14
00:02:14,825 --> 00:02:18,385
Speaker 2:  Switch two. She did the weird mousy thing. She has a lot of thoughts and

15
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:21,665
Speaker 2:  I, I caught her like immediately after the event because I wanted her, her

16
00:02:21,665 --> 00:02:25,145
Speaker 2:  sort of first immediate reactions to using the Switch two. And she had some

17
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,545
Speaker 2:  good ones. We're gonna talk about that also. We're gonna talk to Tom Warren

18
00:02:28,685 --> 00:02:32,425
Speaker 2:  who was there for Microsoft's 50th anniversary celebration Last week,

19
00:02:32,755 --> 00:02:35,985
Speaker 2:  which was interesting. There were protesters,

20
00:02:36,635 --> 00:02:39,945
Speaker 2:  Steve Ballmer was weird. There's a lot going on. So we're gonna talk to Tom

21
00:02:39,945 --> 00:02:43,545
Speaker 2:  about that and also just kind of take stock of Microsoft as it enters its

22
00:02:43,545 --> 00:02:47,225
Speaker 2:  sixth decade as a company. Also, we have a hotline question about

23
00:02:47,295 --> 00:02:50,505
Speaker 2:  tariffs that I'm very excited about. We, this is a question we've heard a

24
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:53,585
Speaker 2:  lot of and I think the answer is both really simple and really complicated.

25
00:02:53,805 --> 00:02:57,105
Speaker 2:  So we're gonna get into that. All of that is coming up in just a second,

26
00:02:57,445 --> 00:03:01,245
Speaker 2:  but first I have to go play GP again. I just can't, I have to play

27
00:03:01,245 --> 00:03:04,285
Speaker 2:  one more game. I'm gonna do one more race, I promise, just one. And then

28
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:06,605
Speaker 2:  we're gonna podcast. This is The Vergecast. We'll be right

29
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:48,165
Speaker 2:  switch world. That's a fair,

30
00:04:48,465 --> 00:04:52,325
Speaker 8:  That's very fair. Yeah, I did sleep

31
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,485
Speaker 8:  a little bit, but not that much. Yeah,

32
00:04:54,485 --> 00:04:57,205
Speaker 2:  That sounds right. So, okay, so what I, what I wanna do is

33
00:04:58,485 --> 00:05:01,485
Speaker 2:  I want to kind of go through the, the good and the bad of what we know about

34
00:05:01,485 --> 00:05:04,285
Speaker 2:  the Switch two. Right? Okay. We, we talked when we first got some information

35
00:05:04,285 --> 00:05:07,885
Speaker 2:  and there was still a lot we didn't know, we know a lot more now.

36
00:05:08,905 --> 00:05:12,205
Speaker 2:  We talked a bunch about it on, on Friday show, but I'm really curious, there's,

37
00:05:12,305 --> 00:05:15,005
Speaker 2:  we got a lot of games, we got a lot of spec announcements, we got a lot of

38
00:05:15,005 --> 00:05:18,285
Speaker 2:  like weird new ideas about things from Nintendo that I wanna talk about.

39
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:22,285
Speaker 2:  So what I asked you to do is basically like, give me some good news and give

40
00:05:22,285 --> 00:05:26,045
Speaker 2:  me some bad news. And we're gonna, we're gonna go through like, I wanna talk

41
00:05:26,045 --> 00:05:28,365
Speaker 2:  about some of the, the stuff we're excited about and some of the stuff that

42
00:05:28,365 --> 00:05:31,685
Speaker 2:  we're worried, concerned, confused, have feelings about.

43
00:05:32,855 --> 00:05:35,525
Speaker 2:  Let's start with the, let's start with the good news. What, what is some

44
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:38,685
Speaker 2:  of the stuff from the announcement that you are like particularly excited

45
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:38,925
Speaker 2:  about?

46
00:05:39,785 --> 00:05:43,565
Speaker 8:  The good news is, is that upgrading your switch one to a switch to

47
00:05:43,695 --> 00:05:47,365
Speaker 8:  makes sense. Hmm. I just remember

48
00:05:47,645 --> 00:05:51,445
Speaker 8:  I got to the chance to play Breath of the Wild on the Switch two and

49
00:05:51,645 --> 00:05:54,965
Speaker 8:  I had the thought like, oh, this is what this game should have looked like

50
00:05:54,965 --> 00:05:58,605
Speaker 8:  eight years ago. Oh, interesting. It, yeah, the Switch two is fulfill, it

51
00:05:58,605 --> 00:06:02,005
Speaker 8:  feels like it's fulfilling the promise of the Switch one, like we all tricked

52
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:05,485
Speaker 8:  ourselves into believing like, oh, this game looks great on the Switch one.

53
00:06:05,785 --> 00:06:09,165
Speaker 8:  No, it actually looks like what it's supposed to on the switch two. And it's

54
00:06:09,165 --> 00:06:12,765
Speaker 8:  like, yeah, it, I'm not a person who early adopts

55
00:06:12,765 --> 00:06:16,685
Speaker 8:  consoles at all. Like I just don't care about them all that much.

56
00:06:17,025 --> 00:06:20,845
Speaker 8:  But this is this Seeing Breath of the Wild specifically and even

57
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:24,725
Speaker 8:  Mario Kart World on the Switch too made me like, yeah, this is a day one

58
00:06:24,965 --> 00:06:25,445
Speaker 8:  purchase for me.

59
00:06:25,945 --> 00:06:29,885
Speaker 2:  Wow. W was it just like bigger, better screen just does

60
00:06:29,885 --> 00:06:30,565
Speaker 2:  the job. It's

61
00:06:30,585 --> 00:06:34,325
Speaker 8:  The whole package. It's the bigger, better screen. It's the frame rate

62
00:06:34,325 --> 00:06:38,125
Speaker 8:  improvements, it's the HDR, it's the 10

63
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:41,925
Speaker 8:  80 p, it's all of that bundled together. Like we know

64
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:45,805
Speaker 8:  that Nintendo doesn't, is not like the spec hound. Like they,

65
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:49,325
Speaker 8:  it's not a big deal if they have like tariff flops of whatever,

66
00:06:49,755 --> 00:06:53,445
Speaker 8:  like, because people still buy and play their games and, but

67
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:57,405
Speaker 8:  now like seeing this, It is like there's a reason why Xbox

68
00:06:57,465 --> 00:07:00,765
Speaker 8:  and PlayStation are so focused on letting us know that you're gonna get the

69
00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:04,725
Speaker 8:  Crispiest graphics and textures. And now that Nintendo has finally like

70
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:08,925
Speaker 8:  gotten to, you know, the base level of that, it's like, okay, yeah, this,

71
00:07:09,155 --> 00:07:13,045
Speaker 8:  this feels like something that's supposed to compete at least with a

72
00:07:13,185 --> 00:07:17,085
Speaker 8:  PS four and an Xbox One. If not, you know, the new consoles out right

73
00:07:17,085 --> 00:07:17,245
Speaker 8:  now.

74
00:07:17,725 --> 00:07:20,085
Speaker 2:  I always, I just feel like both things can be true at the same time. Right?

75
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:23,765
Speaker 2:  Like the Nintendo always says, you know, people don't love our games because

76
00:07:23,765 --> 00:07:26,405
Speaker 2:  they're the highest graphical fidelity and they do the best rate tracing

77
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:29,845
Speaker 2:  that there are more important things about building great games than just

78
00:07:29,845 --> 00:07:33,565
Speaker 2:  that. And like of course that's true. Yes. Unquestionably, I agree with that.

79
00:07:33,825 --> 00:07:37,285
Speaker 2:  And yet wouldn't it be better if it looked better, right? Yes. Both things

80
00:07:37,345 --> 00:07:37,845
Speaker 2:  can be true.

81
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:42,485
Speaker 8:  Not only look better, but like play better too. Like I remember at the, you

82
00:07:42,485 --> 00:07:45,805
Speaker 8:  know, now that we're at the end of the Switch is lifecycle that some of these

83
00:07:45,815 --> 00:07:49,725
Speaker 8:  games that are coming out for the original switch, like it shows the age

84
00:07:49,725 --> 00:07:53,205
Speaker 8:  of the console, like with the 30 FPS and you can see it chugging and you

85
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:56,445
Speaker 8:  can see like the little tears on the edge of models and things like that.

86
00:07:56,505 --> 00:08:00,325
Speaker 8:  But seeing like a buttery smooth 60 up to one 20

87
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:04,405
Speaker 8:  FPS on the switch too, it's like, oh, okay, I get it

88
00:08:04,465 --> 00:08:04,685
Speaker 8:  now.

89
00:08:06,075 --> 00:08:09,405
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that is, that is very exciting. And I think one of the things I've

90
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,925
Speaker 2:  been wondering, like I have not touched the thing yet, and you have is

91
00:08:13,755 --> 00:08:17,605
Speaker 2:  it's, It is a much larger piece of equipment, right? But

92
00:08:17,605 --> 00:08:21,005
Speaker 2:  it's, it seems like it's worth it. My worry has been like, I actually think

93
00:08:21,005 --> 00:08:24,805
Speaker 2:  the size of the switch is, is if not exactly right, like pretty

94
00:08:24,965 --> 00:08:28,605
Speaker 2:  close. It's comfortable to hold in one hand or in two hands for a long time.

95
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:32,245
Speaker 2:  It's like it fits in most places. It feels good. And so I was like, oh no,

96
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:35,325
Speaker 2:  if they made this thing like a lot bigger, maybe it kills one of the things

97
00:08:35,325 --> 00:08:38,365
Speaker 2:  that I really like about it. But it sounds like maybe the trade off's worth

98
00:08:38,365 --> 00:08:39,245
Speaker 2:  it, even if it does do that.

99
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:43,205
Speaker 8:  Yeah, it, it was really hard to get like a good feel for like what the console

100
00:08:43,725 --> 00:08:47,045
Speaker 8:  actually will feel like, you know, out in the wild because Nintendo had them

101
00:08:47,045 --> 00:08:50,285
Speaker 8:  like weighed down with those anti-theft anchors Sure. That make everything

102
00:08:50,285 --> 00:08:51,245
Speaker 8:  super heavy. So I couldn't

103
00:08:51,245 --> 00:08:52,725
Speaker 2:  Like, like being in an Apple store trying to Yeah,

104
00:08:52,725 --> 00:08:55,725
Speaker 8:  Yeah, exactly. So I couldn't get a, a good idea of like what this feels like,

105
00:08:55,825 --> 00:08:59,765
Speaker 8:  but I don't mind the bigger switch. Like, it, it, it's

106
00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:03,445
Speaker 8:  not big enough to where it like registers like, oh, this is a much bigger

107
00:09:03,445 --> 00:09:06,405
Speaker 8:  machine. Like it just feels the same to me. Okay, I'll take that. And same

108
00:09:06,405 --> 00:09:09,125
Speaker 8:  with the controllers and the joycons. They just feel the same. They didn't

109
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,285
Speaker 8:  do anything ergonomically different there. Okay.

110
00:09:11,505 --> 00:09:14,405
Speaker 2:  I'm that, that all feels like what I would've hoped for. I've been saying

111
00:09:14,405 --> 00:09:17,405
Speaker 2:  all along, and I think you, you, you've said this too, that like, give me

112
00:09:17,785 --> 00:09:21,685
Speaker 2:  better switch. Don't give me wild new ideas about the future of gaming and

113
00:09:21,715 --> 00:09:22,805
Speaker 2:  I'll be very happy. And

114
00:09:22,985 --> 00:09:24,365
Speaker 8:  And that's exactly what they did. Yeah.

115
00:09:24,505 --> 00:09:27,525
Speaker 2:  I'm glad. All right. What else? What other, what other good news came outta

116
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,885
Speaker 2:  this for you? I wanna talk about games too. Okay.

117
00:09:29,885 --> 00:09:33,285
Speaker 8:  I was gonna say like the, the games are also a good news.

118
00:09:33,945 --> 00:09:37,645
Speaker 8:  So there were a lot of the games that you saw

119
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:41,525
Speaker 8:  in the direct were at the presentation. You can get a hands on there.

120
00:09:41,585 --> 00:09:45,285
Speaker 8:  So you had like Hades two was there and Street Fighter six.

121
00:09:45,505 --> 00:09:49,445
Speaker 8:  And we got to try some game cue games for Nintendo Switch

122
00:09:49,445 --> 00:09:53,325
Speaker 8:  online. So Win Waker was there. We also got

123
00:09:53,915 --> 00:09:57,445
Speaker 8:  some of the new Nintendo Switch exclusive games like the Super Mario Party

124
00:09:57,525 --> 00:10:01,405
Speaker 8:  Jamboree TV expansion, donkey Kong Bonanza Metro Prime

125
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:05,205
Speaker 8:  Four, the three V three basketball game Drag and Drive

126
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:09,005
Speaker 8:  was also there to demo. So there was a, a healthy mix of

127
00:10:09,245 --> 00:10:13,125
Speaker 8:  games that we got to try and playing the games myself and talking

128
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:16,045
Speaker 8:  to all of my journalist friends that were there, I'm pretty sure like the

129
00:10:16,045 --> 00:10:19,565
Speaker 8:  best in show was Donkey Kong Bonanza, which is y

130
00:10:19,795 --> 00:10:23,005
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Which is exciting because, you know, we would've thought that Mario

131
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:26,805
Speaker 8:  Kart world would've been everyone's number one. And to be clear, it's, it's

132
00:10:26,805 --> 00:10:30,765
Speaker 8:  up there. It's definitely number two. But everyone that I spoke

133
00:10:30,765 --> 00:10:33,965
Speaker 8:  to when I asked them what was your favorite game, it was Donkey Kong Bonanza.

134
00:10:34,505 --> 00:10:38,405
Speaker 8:  And It is, it's this cute game that feels like

135
00:10:38,585 --> 00:10:42,565
Speaker 8:  it will fill the hole that Mario leaves behind because we've got this new

136
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,725
Speaker 8:  Nintendo console coming out, but no game

137
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:50,125
Speaker 8:  dedicated to like Nintendo's big dude. Like there's no new 3D Mario and we

138
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:53,205
Speaker 8:  haven't had one since sip of Mario Odyssey. I mean, we can quibble about

139
00:10:53,205 --> 00:10:56,405
Speaker 8:  Bowser's Fury or whatever if you want, but I'm not gonna do that right now.

140
00:10:57,105 --> 00:11:00,325
Speaker 8:  So like, I was thinking like I had on my personal bingo sheet, like, okay,

141
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:03,365
Speaker 8:  they're gonna announce the 3D Mario here, and they didn't. And I'm like,

142
00:11:03,365 --> 00:11:07,085
Speaker 8:  well that's odd. I mean, it's not out of character for Nintendo, but I, I'm

143
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:10,165
Speaker 8:  thinking it's odd because it has been so long since we've gotten a brand

144
00:11:10,305 --> 00:11:14,205
Speaker 8:  new, not DLC of a 3D Mario game and still we

145
00:11:14,205 --> 00:11:18,005
Speaker 8:  don't, but Donkey Kong Bonanza kind of like fills that hole. Like, I

146
00:11:18,225 --> 00:11:22,005
Speaker 8:  played this and I'm thinking, oh, this is Donkey Kong Odyssey.

147
00:11:22,035 --> 00:11:25,965
Speaker 8:  Like that's what this feels like. And, and and, but not like, you know,

148
00:11:26,575 --> 00:11:30,365
Speaker 8:  Mario Odyssey with a Donkey Kong colored campaign. It, it's

149
00:11:30,365 --> 00:11:33,805
Speaker 8:  different enough but still feels like that quintessential Mario

150
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:37,005
Speaker 8:  platforming experience. And I'm like, this, this is pretty gas,

151
00:11:37,465 --> 00:11:40,165
Speaker 2:  I'm really excited about it. This this, this statement is going to age me

152
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:44,125
Speaker 2:  in a very specific way, but Donkey Kong country on the

153
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:47,885
Speaker 2:  Super Nintendo is probably still to this day in my top three

154
00:11:47,955 --> 00:11:49,685
Speaker 2:  most played video games of all time.

155
00:11:49,955 --> 00:11:51,205
Speaker 8:  It's a great game. It should be.

156
00:11:51,235 --> 00:11:54,965
Speaker 2:  It's so good. Like I love that game to pee. I could probably still play most

157
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,765
Speaker 2:  of that game with my eyes closed and

158
00:11:58,345 --> 00:12:02,245
Speaker 2:  the idea that It is still kind of on the level

159
00:12:02,425 --> 00:12:06,325
Speaker 2:  of like the most important Nintendo characters, just that fact alone,

160
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:09,285
Speaker 2:  like the, the fact that it was the last thing in the announcement and like

161
00:12:09,285 --> 00:12:13,125
Speaker 2:  the, the signal that that sends about how much Nintendo cares about

162
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:16,645
Speaker 2:  this game and this character and how much it matters to the ecosystem. That

163
00:12:16,645 --> 00:12:20,325
Speaker 2:  alone made me so happy. It's like Donkey Kong is like so back in, in the

164
00:12:20,325 --> 00:12:20,845
Speaker 2:  best way. Oh

165
00:12:20,845 --> 00:12:24,365
Speaker 8:  Yeah. We are so back. And he is got like a brand new character design that's

166
00:12:24,365 --> 00:12:28,285
Speaker 8:  really fun and expressive and I am, I'm looking forward to playing more of

167
00:12:28,285 --> 00:12:29,885
Speaker 8:  that game. It was a lot of fun. That's awesome.

168
00:12:30,185 --> 00:12:33,405
Speaker 2:  I'm also really excited just to hear that you could play that many games.

169
00:12:33,645 --> 00:12:36,845
Speaker 2:  I feel like we've, we've been burned a lot recently by

170
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:40,965
Speaker 2:  coming soon games and in the coming months games and,

171
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:44,245
Speaker 2:  you know, in development games and everybody who like announces and then

172
00:12:44,405 --> 00:12:47,605
Speaker 2:  announces and then announces and then announces games. So the fact that these

173
00:12:47,605 --> 00:12:51,445
Speaker 2:  are like done games or at least done enough games that you could play them,

174
00:12:52,325 --> 00:12:54,925
Speaker 2:  I, I feel like speaks very well to what the next few months are gonna look

175
00:12:54,925 --> 00:12:55,205
Speaker 2:  like here.

176
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:59,445
Speaker 8:  My my cynical thought before I got into the event yesterday was that we were

177
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,205
Speaker 8:  just gonna get a bunch of switch one games on the Switch two. Like I didn't

178
00:13:02,205 --> 00:13:05,245
Speaker 8:  think they would have the, the breadth of games that they did have there.

179
00:13:05,365 --> 00:13:06,525
Speaker 8:  I was quite surprised.

180
00:13:06,915 --> 00:13:08,525
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I'm, I'm psyched

181
00:13:08,525 --> 00:13:11,645
Speaker 8:  About that. Oh, do you, do you wanna know a fun little insider secret? Yes.

182
00:13:11,645 --> 00:13:14,525
Speaker 8:  That I thought was really funny. So one of the games that they announced

183
00:13:15,065 --> 00:13:19,005
Speaker 8:  at the direct was a switch port of Hogwarts legacy and that went

184
00:13:19,005 --> 00:13:21,965
Speaker 8:  over like a lead balloon, like nobody cave a crab when we were watching it

185
00:13:21,965 --> 00:13:23,885
Speaker 8:  all together in the presentation. I didn't

186
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:24,965
Speaker 2:  Even notice that. Yeah,

187
00:13:24,965 --> 00:13:28,845
Speaker 8:  Exactly. And then when we got onto like the demo floor, like there

188
00:13:28,845 --> 00:13:32,045
Speaker 8:  were some stations set up to demo Hog Works legacy and nobody touched it.

189
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,885
Speaker 8:  And I thought it was the funniest thing,

190
00:13:35,955 --> 00:13:38,445
Speaker 8:  like throughout the time I was there it was empty.

191
00:13:39,165 --> 00:13:43,005
Speaker 2:  I love that. Just giant crowds around everything except two stations. Yes.

192
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:46,925
Speaker 2:  That's amazing. Exactly. That's that's very good. What else? Are there

193
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:50,805
Speaker 2:  other good news, other surprising excitement coming out of the, the announcement?

194
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:55,405
Speaker 8:  So one of the things that I thought and on the game side that was

195
00:13:55,405 --> 00:13:58,685
Speaker 8:  like really interesting that I, when I first saw it, I had like kind of like

196
00:13:58,685 --> 00:14:01,245
Speaker 8:  a lukewarm response to it, but then when I saw it in action, I'm like, actually

197
00:14:01,245 --> 00:14:04,605
Speaker 8:  this works is the Nintendo Switch to welcome tour,

198
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:08,725
Speaker 8:  which is the game that you, I guess

199
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:12,445
Speaker 8:  Nintendo made to like introduce you to the switch to. So it, it tells you

200
00:14:12,515 --> 00:14:16,485
Speaker 8:  like how it works and all these different new features with a bunch of

201
00:14:16,485 --> 00:14:20,325
Speaker 8:  mini games. It is very much Nintendo's Astros playroom and getting my

202
00:14:20,325 --> 00:14:24,205
Speaker 8:  hands on it. It's actually really cool and informative. Like

203
00:14:24,205 --> 00:14:28,085
Speaker 8:  we don't get to see very much how the sausage gets made. We have like Mark

204
00:14:28,085 --> 00:14:31,445
Speaker 8:  Cerney talking about PS five tariff flops and things like that and your eyes

205
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:33,805
Speaker 8:  cross and you're like, I have no idea what you're talking about. None of

206
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:36,365
Speaker 8:  these words are in the Bible, but seeing Nintendo really break that down

207
00:14:36,515 --> 00:14:40,485
Speaker 8:  with how their joy cons work or you know, what

208
00:14:40,775 --> 00:14:44,445
Speaker 8:  explaining frame rates, like there was a tutorial or a little quiz or

209
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:48,325
Speaker 8:  little info thing that explained like, here's the difference between

210
00:14:48,325 --> 00:14:52,285
Speaker 8:  30 FPS and 60 FPS and 120 FPS. And it's, it's something like, you

211
00:14:52,285 --> 00:14:55,925
Speaker 8:  know, intellectually and you can see the difference, but actually having

212
00:14:56,045 --> 00:14:59,805
Speaker 8:  a technical explanation for why 30 FPS looks different than 60

213
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:03,685
Speaker 8:  X ps FPS was like really informative and I really appreciated that.

214
00:15:03,785 --> 00:15:07,325
Speaker 8:  So that was one of those like little weird stand that's like, oh okay, this

215
00:15:07,325 --> 00:15:10,925
Speaker 8:  is actually better than I gave it credit for. So kudos to Nintendo on that.

216
00:15:11,155 --> 00:15:13,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's cool. And I was actually gonna ask you about that 'cause there

217
00:15:13,285 --> 00:15:13,765
Speaker 2:  was some

218
00:15:15,525 --> 00:15:19,205
Speaker 2:  surprise maybe at the fact that this is a paid game that it's like you, you're

219
00:15:19,205 --> 00:15:22,645
Speaker 2:  gonna make me pay to like play the manual for the console.

220
00:15:22,985 --> 00:15:26,085
Speaker 2:  But even just describing it as like Nintendo's version of of Astro's play

221
00:15:26,155 --> 00:15:28,445
Speaker 2:  kind of makes that make a lot more sense.

222
00:15:29,235 --> 00:15:29,765
Speaker 8:  Yeah. So

223
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:32,205
Speaker 2:  I still think it should maybe be free, but that's neither here nor there.

224
00:15:32,385 --> 00:15:35,405
Speaker 8:  The way that we, you know, set this up. You told me like give me three good

225
00:15:35,405 --> 00:15:38,605
Speaker 8:  things and three bad things. Yeah. Nintendo Switch welcome tour is on my

226
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,405
Speaker 8:  good and my bad side. Ah, fair enough. Okay. And the bad part is because

227
00:15:41,785 --> 00:15:45,605
Speaker 8:  It is not a pack in game like Astro's playroom was is something that you

228
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:47,845
Speaker 8:  have to pay for and that just doesn't make sense to me.

229
00:15:48,035 --> 00:15:51,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's that's very fair. All right, so let's switch to, let's switch

230
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:55,125
Speaker 2:  to some bad news. Okay. I, I have, I have a couple that

231
00:15:55,165 --> 00:15:58,325
Speaker 2:  I want to ask you about specifically. Okay. But give, give me your list first.

232
00:15:58,385 --> 00:16:01,205
Speaker 2:  So the Astros player room shenanigans available. Yeah. The

233
00:16:01,205 --> 00:16:05,125
Speaker 8:  Nintendo Switch tour is, is the bad news because there's no rhyme or reason

234
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:08,405
Speaker 8:  that that is a paid game and just not included. It is the list. The other

235
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:11,925
Speaker 8:  bad news, which I have a feeling is gonna be on the top of yours and everyone's

236
00:16:11,925 --> 00:16:15,645
Speaker 8:  list is the price. Like, what are we doing here,

237
00:16:15,645 --> 00:16:19,125
Speaker 8:  folks? Like I know what we're doing here and I think we have a good idea

238
00:16:19,385 --> 00:16:23,125
Speaker 8:  why we're doing what we're doing here, but holy crap, you're gonna ask

239
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:26,725
Speaker 8:  people to pay an additional 150 bucks for

240
00:16:26,835 --> 00:16:30,205
Speaker 8:  this thing. And then the thing with that is, is you're actually gonna ask

241
00:16:30,205 --> 00:16:34,005
Speaker 8:  people to pay $500 for this because you're gonna want the

242
00:16:34,005 --> 00:16:37,805
Speaker 8:  bundle that bundles Mario Kart world and the Nintendo Switch two because

243
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:41,565
Speaker 8:  that game all by itself will be 80 of God's own

244
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:45,285
Speaker 8:  dollars. And that isic you get a $30

245
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:49,165
Speaker 8:  like price cut if you buy it bundled and it just doesn't make

246
00:16:49,445 --> 00:16:52,085
Speaker 8:  economical sense to do it other than that. And then they're making a limited

247
00:16:52,085 --> 00:16:54,765
Speaker 8:  amount of it when it's done, It is done. They're not gonna do that anymore.

248
00:16:54,835 --> 00:16:58,645
Speaker 8:  According to Nintendo. They might, it would make sense for them too, but

249
00:16:58,645 --> 00:17:02,525
Speaker 8:  they said once those the, they run out like, we're not gonna restock this.

250
00:17:02,525 --> 00:17:06,165
Speaker 8:  So you gotta get your pre-orders in. God. I just probably started a rush

251
00:17:06,265 --> 00:17:08,485
Speaker 8:  on Nintendo such two pre-orders. I'm sorry,

252
00:17:08,765 --> 00:17:11,605
Speaker 2:  I may or may not have already filled out the form that promised to alert

253
00:17:11,605 --> 00:17:15,485
Speaker 2:  me when pre-orders are available. Okay. I'm, I confess I'm slightly

254
00:17:15,515 --> 00:17:19,255
Speaker 2:  torn on the price because on the one hand It is much more

255
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:23,135
Speaker 2:  expensive. I think I expected it to be a little more expensive, but

256
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:26,895
Speaker 2:  I would've probably pegged the price at like, I don't know,

257
00:17:26,895 --> 00:17:29,615
Speaker 2:  3 79 instead of four 50.

258
00:17:31,155 --> 00:17:35,015
Speaker 2:  But, you know, whatever inflation tariffs, the world is chaos. Some of this

259
00:17:35,015 --> 00:17:37,735
Speaker 2:  is probably Nintendo's doing, some of It is probably not.

260
00:17:38,535 --> 00:17:42,375
Speaker 2:  Consoles in general have gotten more expensive over time. So like I I sort

261
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:46,335
Speaker 2:  of under, I do think the combination of substantially more expensive

262
00:17:46,335 --> 00:17:47,375
Speaker 2:  console and,

263
00:17:47,515 --> 00:17:50,245
Speaker 8:  And substantially more expensive games is the thing.

264
00:17:50,305 --> 00:17:54,125
Speaker 2:  Yes. Normalizing 70 and $80 games I think is a real, real,

265
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:54,765
Speaker 2:  real bummer.

266
00:17:55,035 --> 00:17:58,765
Speaker 8:  It's turbo bad. Like it's, it's the one-two punch is

267
00:17:58,865 --> 00:18:02,445
Speaker 8:  is really hard. And a lot of families, especially now with everything that's

268
00:18:02,445 --> 00:18:06,245
Speaker 8:  going on with these brand new tariffs that hit just today, it's gonna make

269
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:09,965
Speaker 8:  a lot of families like pe people are already choosing

270
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:13,725
Speaker 8:  between, you know, buying their groceries and doing other things and overwhelmingly

271
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:17,325
Speaker 8:  people are gonna buy their groceries. This is gonna do nothing but hurt those

272
00:18:18,085 --> 00:18:21,965
Speaker 8:  families that buy these consoles. It's, it's just, that's a tough, tough

273
00:18:22,145 --> 00:18:25,845
Speaker 8:  ask from Nintendo right now, but everybody's asking more money from

274
00:18:26,165 --> 00:18:29,325
Speaker 8:  all of us everywhere, so I understand it. Well, and

275
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:33,125
Speaker 2:  I think what's, what's weird is it puts Nintendo into the

276
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:36,925
Speaker 2:  kind of like direct competition with Sony and

277
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:40,925
Speaker 2:  Microsoft that it has always kind of enjoyed not doing right? Like Nintendo

278
00:18:40,925 --> 00:18:43,925
Speaker 2:  has just al like, we make fun of Nintendo because like the gaming business

279
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:47,605
Speaker 2:  is over here and Nintendo is just like all the way over there doing whatever

280
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:51,485
Speaker 2:  Nintendo's doing and they're like inching closer to this other sort of

281
00:18:51,855 --> 00:18:55,845
Speaker 2:  messy loot boxy, take all of your money no matter what world

282
00:18:55,905 --> 00:18:57,445
Speaker 2:  in a way that I I I don't love.

283
00:18:57,905 --> 00:19:00,725
Speaker 8:  The funny thing is is they completely leaped over the competition because

284
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:04,485
Speaker 8:  they're advertising $80 games. Like we just blew past

285
00:19:04,755 --> 00:19:08,485
Speaker 8:  70 all the way to 80. And I'm hearing some places

286
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:12,685
Speaker 8:  like overseas are gonna charge $90, $90

287
00:19:12,865 --> 00:19:16,165
Speaker 8:  for the physical edition of Mario Kart World. And my eyes kinda like bugged

288
00:19:16,165 --> 00:19:20,125
Speaker 8:  outta my head like, yeah, back in, you know, 1999 we were paying 120

289
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,925
Speaker 8:  bucks for Nintendo 64 cartridges, but holy crap,

290
00:19:23,925 --> 00:19:27,405
Speaker 8:  like we've had the $60 has been normalized for a good long time,

291
00:19:27,825 --> 00:19:31,805
Speaker 8:  but, and to see a $30 price jump all at once is just gonna create

292
00:19:31,845 --> 00:19:33,125
Speaker 8:  a sticker shock for a lot of people.

293
00:19:33,395 --> 00:19:37,245
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. This goes from being like a, a thing you can buy a console and

294
00:19:37,285 --> 00:19:41,165
Speaker 2:  a couple of games for like a good Christmas

295
00:19:41,165 --> 00:19:44,405
Speaker 2:  present down to like, you're, you, you're gonna run this thing into like

296
00:19:44,445 --> 00:19:46,085
Speaker 2:  a thousand dollars without trying very hard.

297
00:19:46,315 --> 00:19:50,165
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And the the other thing attached to the

298
00:19:50,165 --> 00:19:54,005
Speaker 8:  games, not necessarily, you know, their price that makes this suck even more

299
00:19:54,065 --> 00:19:58,005
Speaker 8:  is that some of these physical games won't even have the game data

300
00:19:58,105 --> 00:20:01,845
Speaker 8:  on them, but they will be required to be inserted into the switch to run

301
00:20:01,845 --> 00:20:05,205
Speaker 8:  the games. I'm seeing things called game keys where

302
00:20:05,825 --> 00:20:09,765
Speaker 8:  you actually, you put the cartridge in, you still have to download the game

303
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:13,485
Speaker 8:  online, but you still need the, the cartridge to run. And I'm like, what

304
00:20:13,485 --> 00:20:17,245
Speaker 8:  are we doing here? Like, this sucks. Like I'm already planning to go

305
00:20:17,295 --> 00:20:20,725
Speaker 8:  fully physical for the switch to, because I am seeing the

306
00:20:20,725 --> 00:20:23,965
Speaker 8:  shenanigans that these console companies are getting up to with like

307
00:20:24,285 --> 00:20:27,605
Speaker 8:  revoking digital game access and things like that. Like I have been completely

308
00:20:28,005 --> 00:20:31,285
Speaker 8:  physical media pilled, but now you're making it so that the physical

309
00:20:31,335 --> 00:20:34,445
Speaker 8:  cartridges don't even have the games on them anymore. You're just selling

310
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:38,365
Speaker 8:  us plastic with just a little bit of thing that we still need.

311
00:20:38,365 --> 00:20:41,725
Speaker 8:  Like this is terrible for game preservation first of all. And it's anti-consumer.

312
00:20:41,725 --> 00:20:43,285
Speaker 8:  It doesn't make any sense. I hate it. Yeah.

313
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:46,005
Speaker 2:  So that the, the game key thing was actually one of the ones I was gonna

314
00:20:46,005 --> 00:20:49,745
Speaker 2:  ask you about because it, I I think, I just don't

315
00:20:49,745 --> 00:20:53,065
Speaker 2:  understand what Nintendo is trying to do here because

316
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:54,185
Speaker 8:  I have no idea. It

317
00:20:54,185 --> 00:20:58,065
Speaker 2:  Is, It is one thing to like, you know, have, have digital

318
00:20:58,155 --> 00:21:01,945
Speaker 2:  games that are DMed in some way. Like Sure. Whatever. And I think we're all

319
00:21:01,945 --> 00:21:05,745
Speaker 2:  sort of becoming increasingly physical media pilled as a result. Like watching

320
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:08,705
Speaker 2:  all of the stuff that happens to emulators and the way that games go away

321
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:12,265
Speaker 2:  and the way that, that all of this stuff is just being lost to time over

322
00:21:12,265 --> 00:21:15,745
Speaker 2:  time. Like, you, you should buy cartridges. I'm fully pro cartridges.

323
00:21:17,225 --> 00:21:20,385
Speaker 2:  I kind of don't get the point of the game key thing. Like I

324
00:21:20,385 --> 00:21:21,585
Speaker 8:  Don't either, I can't see it

325
00:21:22,045 --> 00:21:25,745
Speaker 2:  Except if Nintendo is trying to just be

326
00:21:25,775 --> 00:21:29,665
Speaker 2:  more in control of everything. The idea is like we, we've seen

327
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:33,185
Speaker 2:  Nintendo crackdown on emulators, we've seen Nintendo like really start to

328
00:21:33,415 --> 00:21:37,305
Speaker 2:  push to stop people playing its games that it doesn't want to play its games.

329
00:21:37,685 --> 00:21:41,105
Speaker 2:  And maybe this is just yet another way to do that, but I don't know, it feels

330
00:21:41,105 --> 00:21:44,385
Speaker 2:  like there has to be something I'm missing here or this just sucks.

331
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,265
Speaker 8:  So my boss Andrew Webster is probably sitting right now in a meeting with

332
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:51,985
Speaker 8:  Doug Bowser and that is definitely one of the questions on his list. So hopefully

333
00:21:52,295 --> 00:21:55,505
Speaker 8:  Doug will give us a not mely mild answer for that.

334
00:21:56,105 --> 00:21:59,625
Speaker 2:  I don't, I don't have a ton of hope on that, but if if they do, if, if we

335
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:03,385
Speaker 2:  do get a real answer, we'll we'll come back and talk about it. What else

336
00:22:03,385 --> 00:22:04,225
Speaker 2:  is on your bad news list?

337
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:08,665
Speaker 8:  The, the last thing on my bad news list is actually the mouse controls. So

338
00:22:08,725 --> 00:22:12,625
Speaker 8:  the big new gimmicky thing that Nintendo is in bundling with this console

339
00:22:12,805 --> 00:22:16,385
Speaker 8:  is the fact that you can turn your JoyCon into a mouse. And I hate it,

340
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:21,345
Speaker 8:  I hate it right now. Okay. I didn't see anything

341
00:22:21,735 --> 00:22:25,545
Speaker 8:  that there that made me think, oh, this game is why this

342
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:28,745
Speaker 8:  feature makes sense. So they had Dragon Drive, which is the three V three

343
00:22:28,745 --> 00:22:32,545
Speaker 8:  basketball thing and it's kind of cute to put the joy cons like on a table

344
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:36,585
Speaker 8:  and do like this motion like you're pushing a wheelchair,

345
00:22:36,885 --> 00:22:40,745
Speaker 8:  but It is so awkward to hold in your hand like this. It's just

346
00:22:41,005 --> 00:22:43,865
Speaker 2:  You basically, like you, you pull the joycons out, sort of turn them sideways

347
00:22:43,925 --> 00:22:45,345
Speaker 2:  and stick them down on. Yeah. Okay.

348
00:22:45,605 --> 00:22:49,505
Speaker 8:  And this is not a natural position No. To hold a JoyCon in

349
00:22:49,505 --> 00:22:53,185
Speaker 8:  because there's a reason why we design mice to be flat so your hand can kind

350
00:22:53,185 --> 00:22:57,025
Speaker 8:  of like rest in this neutral position as you move it around. And the

351
00:22:57,045 --> 00:23:00,745
Speaker 8:  joy cons as mice don't fit that natural

352
00:23:00,815 --> 00:23:04,465
Speaker 8:  neutral position profile. So I don't have any issues with like carpal

353
00:23:04,465 --> 00:23:07,545
Speaker 8:  tunnels or like joint pain in my shoulders or whatever, but just doing this

354
00:23:07,605 --> 00:23:10,985
Speaker 8:  for a little bit, like I could feel like pain and tension start to like

355
00:23:11,425 --> 00:23:15,145
Speaker 8:  aggravate my arm and I'm like, if you have any kind of like wrist issues,

356
00:23:15,455 --> 00:23:19,425
Speaker 8:  like this is gonna play hell on your joints. It, it's painful. I didn't like

357
00:23:19,425 --> 00:23:23,225
Speaker 8:  it at all and I just, I don't, I don't see it. Like there's nothing that

358
00:23:23,225 --> 00:23:26,425
Speaker 8:  made me go, oh, this is good. And I tried it again for

359
00:23:27,075 --> 00:23:30,305
Speaker 8:  Metro Prime four and one of the things that that an annoyed me about that

360
00:23:30,365 --> 00:23:34,265
Speaker 8:  was that they have, you know, the two different control schemes,

361
00:23:34,405 --> 00:23:38,265
Speaker 8:  you could either play it like with Gyro controls with the split joycons one

362
00:23:38,265 --> 00:23:42,225
Speaker 8:  in each hand, or you could split it where one is a mouse and one JoyCon

363
00:23:42,245 --> 00:23:45,885
Speaker 8:  is like free on your hand and nothing with like a traditional controller

364
00:23:45,885 --> 00:23:49,005
Speaker 8:  setup. Like, no, I didn't have that option or at least at the station I was

365
00:23:49,005 --> 00:23:51,365
Speaker 8:  at, I didn't have that option. Interesting. And I wish I did because I think

366
00:23:51,365 --> 00:23:55,325
Speaker 8:  I would've enjoyed the demo a lot more and it's just, you've got lock

367
00:23:55,325 --> 00:23:58,845
Speaker 8:  on still, but like I was just having a hard time trying to like figure this

368
00:23:58,845 --> 00:24:02,685
Speaker 8:  out and aim and move and it seems like at least with Mouse controls

369
00:24:02,685 --> 00:24:05,845
Speaker 8:  and Metro Prime four, that there's gonna be a steep learning curve to get

370
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:09,685
Speaker 8:  that right in order to play the game effectively. But then I realized

371
00:24:09,755 --> 00:24:13,485
Speaker 8:  like y'all played the first three metro primes on

372
00:24:13,545 --> 00:24:17,445
Speaker 8:  the damn wee using waggle phases, so it's like, oh shit, we're just doing

373
00:24:17,445 --> 00:24:18,845
Speaker 8:  that shit again. Well, so that's kind

374
00:24:18,845 --> 00:24:22,685
Speaker 2:  Of what I wonder is I look at the mouse controls and I, I can't decide if

375
00:24:22,685 --> 00:24:26,605
Speaker 2:  that's just a thing Nintendo occasionally does and all

376
00:24:26,605 --> 00:24:29,245
Speaker 2:  really all these gaming platforms do, which is they just sort of invent a

377
00:24:29,245 --> 00:24:32,525
Speaker 2:  weird thing that you can build into your game if you want to and no one really

378
00:24:32,525 --> 00:24:36,245
Speaker 2:  does. And eventually they phase it out. It's like the, they, the move controllers

379
00:24:36,245 --> 00:24:39,205
Speaker 2:  or the Connect or whatever, like everybody has tried to come up with some

380
00:24:39,425 --> 00:24:42,645
Speaker 2:  new gimmick and they're like, maybe this will be fun for your game. And there

381
00:24:42,645 --> 00:24:45,765
Speaker 2:  are a few games that like really make use of it, but for the most part they're

382
00:24:45,765 --> 00:24:49,445
Speaker 2:  just not part of the system at all. Or if this is a thing,

383
00:24:49,445 --> 00:24:53,045
Speaker 2:  Nintendo is going to try to make like an actual sort of

384
00:24:53,135 --> 00:24:57,005
Speaker 2:  first class part of how people play Nintendo games. And as

385
00:24:57,245 --> 00:25:01,005
Speaker 2:  somebody who mostly sits here at my computer with my switch plugged

386
00:25:01,145 --> 00:25:05,125
Speaker 2:  in into the dock with a, with a full on controller,

387
00:25:05,195 --> 00:25:06,485
Speaker 2:  that would be a real bummer for me.

388
00:25:06,915 --> 00:25:07,725
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I

389
00:25:09,285 --> 00:25:12,845
Speaker 8:  I have a feeling that Nintendo is gonna make this like their

390
00:25:12,925 --> 00:25:16,765
Speaker 8:  flagship like feature of this console in addition to like the chat and

391
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:20,165
Speaker 8:  the the video chat thing that was also announced,

392
00:25:20,705 --> 00:25:24,605
Speaker 8:  but whatever they have right now is not there to

393
00:25:24,605 --> 00:25:28,205
Speaker 8:  really demonstrate this is the vision that we have for this. Like, you've

394
00:25:28,205 --> 00:25:31,885
Speaker 8:  got drag and drive, which is essentially a, a, you know, a paid tech demo

395
00:25:31,945 --> 00:25:35,565
Speaker 8:  for this, for this function, but that didn't really

396
00:25:35,745 --> 00:25:39,605
Speaker 8:  wow me or sell me on it. But I, I just, not a

397
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:43,325
Speaker 8:  faith, but I have this inkling because Nintendo, at the end of the day, they

398
00:25:43,325 --> 00:25:46,085
Speaker 8:  kind of really, sometimes they really do know what they're doing in terms

399
00:25:46,085 --> 00:25:49,045
Speaker 8:  of like hardware and gimmicking and stuff like that because, you know, the

400
00:25:49,155 --> 00:25:51,725
Speaker 8:  WiMo was, you know, we all complained about wacko physics, but at the end

401
00:25:51,725 --> 00:25:55,205
Speaker 8:  of the day that was kind of fun. Not implemented all the time in the best

402
00:25:55,205 --> 00:25:58,365
Speaker 8:  ways, but it was still fun and unique and innovative. And I have a feeling

403
00:25:58,365 --> 00:26:02,085
Speaker 8:  this will be too, we just need to give them time to cook and figure out something

404
00:26:02,085 --> 00:26:03,165
Speaker 8:  that really makes it pop.

405
00:26:04,045 --> 00:26:07,925
Speaker 2:  I do worry about the, just the ergonomics of it on that front. It's not good.

406
00:26:07,935 --> 00:26:10,565
Speaker 2:  Right? 'cause I think you're right that when n when Nintendo is like, when

407
00:26:10,565 --> 00:26:14,245
Speaker 2:  they're all in on something, they're right a lot, right? Like it's usually

408
00:26:14,275 --> 00:26:17,525
Speaker 2:  when it's kind of weird is when Nintendo is just like, here's a thing kind

409
00:26:17,525 --> 00:26:20,085
Speaker 2:  of off to the side, do what you want with it. But when Nintendo is like,

410
00:26:20,085 --> 00:26:23,525
Speaker 2:  this is how we play games now, it's usually right, right. Yes. Like the,

411
00:26:23,545 --> 00:26:27,125
Speaker 2:  the, the DS universe is like that, that's one version of that where they're

412
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:30,365
Speaker 2:  like, this is how you do it. And it was, it was pretty right. But just the

413
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:34,405
Speaker 2:  sheer like what it feels like to even just looking at like pictures of people's

414
00:26:34,405 --> 00:26:36,805
Speaker 2:  hands trying to hold the joy con on it. It just doesn't

415
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:40,525
Speaker 8:  Look right. It's not, it's awkward. Your hand isn't

416
00:26:40,895 --> 00:26:44,805
Speaker 8:  meant to do that. The, the, the Joy con is too small, so your

417
00:26:44,805 --> 00:26:48,365
Speaker 8:  fingers kind of curl around the back and then you get like this claw hand

418
00:26:48,725 --> 00:26:52,285
Speaker 8:  situation versus something where you can just lay your hands out like completely

419
00:26:52,315 --> 00:26:56,125
Speaker 8:  flat like this on a mouse. It just, it just does not feel good. So

420
00:26:56,185 --> 00:27:00,165
Speaker 8:  the idea is either they will figure out something that will

421
00:27:00,165 --> 00:27:03,085
Speaker 8:  make this work or Nintendo's about to pump out a bunch of

422
00:27:03,635 --> 00:27:06,485
Speaker 8:  accessories that you can buy that actually makes the mouse make sense.

423
00:27:07,155 --> 00:27:10,485
Speaker 2:  Fair. Yeah. There's definitely a, there's like a holster you could make for

424
00:27:10,485 --> 00:27:12,205
Speaker 2:  that thing that would make it a lot more

425
00:27:12,485 --> 00:27:15,485
Speaker 8:  Workable. Yeah. Like we're about to get those little, remember those little

426
00:27:15,485 --> 00:27:19,245
Speaker 8:  plastic diapers we used to wrap the We Modes in or

427
00:27:19,365 --> 00:27:22,005
Speaker 8:  whatever. We're about to get something like that for those joy cons.

428
00:27:22,445 --> 00:27:25,685
Speaker 2:  A hundred percent. Okay. I have two more things Sure. That I wanna know if

429
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:29,005
Speaker 2:  they're good news or bad news. And then I'm gonna let you go. First thing

430
00:27:29,005 --> 00:27:31,965
Speaker 2:  is the switch to is kind of obsessed with the Game Cube.

431
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:35,765
Speaker 2:  There's a Game Cube controller for the switch to, there's a bunch of Game

432
00:27:35,765 --> 00:27:39,485
Speaker 2:  Cube games coming. It's like this is a real game

433
00:27:39,515 --> 00:27:43,445
Speaker 2:  Cube ance happening with this console. Is that, is that good news or

434
00:27:43,445 --> 00:27:43,845
Speaker 2:  bad news?

435
00:27:44,685 --> 00:27:48,495
Speaker 8:  It's a little bit of both. Okay. The Game Cube is, has

436
00:27:48,495 --> 00:27:52,375
Speaker 8:  not been adequately represented on the Nintendo Switch online offerings.

437
00:27:52,555 --> 00:27:56,455
Speaker 8:  So that's good news. I mean, I know a lot of people are really excited about

438
00:27:56,455 --> 00:28:00,135
Speaker 8:  having Soul Caliber two with Link in it available to play again.

439
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:04,815
Speaker 8:  And, but I personally, my pet, you know, tinfoil Hat theory is that

440
00:28:04,815 --> 00:28:08,335
Speaker 8:  Nintendo got really tired of a bunch of people being like,

441
00:28:08,565 --> 00:28:12,055
Speaker 8:  where's the win Waker remaster? And I'm like, best I can do is just give

442
00:28:12,055 --> 00:28:15,255
Speaker 8:  you win Wake again and you're gonna pay $80 for it.

443
00:28:15,715 --> 00:28:19,615
Speaker 2:  That's fair. Yeah. And I think the Game Cube is always very funny

444
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:22,935
Speaker 2:  to me. 'cause like in my own gaming experience, I really jumped

445
00:28:23,615 --> 00:28:27,135
Speaker 2:  straight from the N 64 to the we, so the Game Cube was just never quite

446
00:28:27,595 --> 00:28:31,095
Speaker 2:  in my world. But I sort of feel like everybody loves the Game Cube in

447
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:34,615
Speaker 2:  retrospect more than they actually like, loved it when they owned it.

448
00:28:34,955 --> 00:28:36,135
Speaker 8:  Yes. I think that's correct.

449
00:28:36,475 --> 00:28:40,455
Speaker 2:  But It is also like the, the true old head gamers are

450
00:28:40,455 --> 00:28:42,855
Speaker 2:  the ones who seem to love the Game Cube the most. Which

451
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:46,535
Speaker 8:  Is weird because that, well It is old, but it it's not old

452
00:28:46,685 --> 00:28:50,615
Speaker 8:  head. Right? Like, oh, that's just so weird to say. Like, I

453
00:28:50,615 --> 00:28:53,975
Speaker 8:  was a, I think I was a teenager when the N 64 came out, and you're right,

454
00:28:53,975 --> 00:28:57,775
Speaker 8:  like my mind completely glosses over the Game Cube and I went right from

455
00:28:57,975 --> 00:29:00,855
Speaker 8:  Nintendo 64 to the Wii. But

456
00:29:02,925 --> 00:29:06,015
Speaker 8:  some of those games are really fun. Yeah. Like we've got a new Kirby Air

457
00:29:06,015 --> 00:29:09,975
Speaker 8:  ride game. Like wasn't that a Game Cube game? So yeah, we're, we're, we're,

458
00:29:10,495 --> 00:29:14,095
Speaker 8:  I guess that's where they are as you know, they're going back in their history

459
00:29:14,095 --> 00:29:16,735
Speaker 8:  and now it's time for the Game Cube to come back. 'cause they've already

460
00:29:16,765 --> 00:29:20,655
Speaker 8:  done the, the Nintendo and the Super Nintendo. They've got

461
00:29:20,655 --> 00:29:23,655
Speaker 8:  some We stuff and now it's like, okay, yeah, we gotta go back and get the

462
00:29:23,655 --> 00:29:25,135
Speaker 8:  Game Cube and bring that up to speed too.

463
00:29:25,325 --> 00:29:28,215
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's fair. I have heard a bunch of people who are very excited just

464
00:29:28,215 --> 00:29:32,095
Speaker 2:  to have F zero GX back, which

465
00:29:32,095 --> 00:29:35,495
Speaker 2:  like, sure. Kudo, I'm happy for all of you. Okay, last one.

466
00:29:36,325 --> 00:29:39,975
Speaker 2:  This console is really into video chat, like

467
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:42,925
Speaker 2:  game chat in particular, but specifically video chat.

468
00:29:44,435 --> 00:29:45,485
Speaker 2:  Good news or bad news.

469
00:29:45,755 --> 00:29:49,725
Speaker 8:  Good news. Yeah. Yeah. What this is, this is one of the things, so, you know

470
00:29:49,725 --> 00:29:53,325
Speaker 8:  that comic where it's like, you know, it's a hot guy knocking on a

471
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:56,485
Speaker 8:  lady's like cubicle and she's like, Hey there. And, and the lady's like,

472
00:29:56,485 --> 00:29:59,605
Speaker 8:  oh, aren't you cute? And then it's like a less attractive guy who's like,

473
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:03,685
Speaker 8:  Hey there. And she's like, human resources, this is the Nintendo

474
00:30:03,685 --> 00:30:07,245
Speaker 8:  doing that is like the same thing between the connect and the video chat.

475
00:30:07,425 --> 00:30:10,925
Speaker 8:  So like the connect is like human resources. Hello. What? But now that Nintendo's

476
00:30:10,925 --> 00:30:14,045
Speaker 8:  doing It is like, oh, okay, yeah, this is cool. I get it. They're so many

477
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:17,725
Speaker 8:  years late, but they are executing on this

478
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:21,965
Speaker 8:  so much better. It's just like, I, they can't keep getting away

479
00:30:21,965 --> 00:30:25,925
Speaker 8:  with it. And yet they are like, it does these really cool things like

480
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:29,605
Speaker 8:  where you can put your body in a game, like in the Super Mario Party

481
00:30:29,605 --> 00:30:33,485
Speaker 8:  Jamboree TV expansion. Like it takes a picture of you and it puts you in

482
00:30:33,485 --> 00:30:37,125
Speaker 8:  the game and you can like, do all kinds of weird cool things that look cool

483
00:30:37,355 --> 00:30:40,685
Speaker 8:  that families are just gonna love. Like, I can look at that and see like,

484
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:44,045
Speaker 8:  yep, families with young kids are gonna have a blast with this.

485
00:30:44,505 --> 00:30:47,205
Speaker 8:  And you know, one of the things that we were talking about here at The Verge

486
00:30:47,205 --> 00:30:50,885
Speaker 8:  was like, oh, we can do meetings on this now. Mm. Like, let's, let's hold

487
00:30:50,885 --> 00:30:54,725
Speaker 8:  like our weekly standup meeting and then switch to video chat. Like, and

488
00:30:54,725 --> 00:30:58,485
Speaker 8:  that's something that you could do. And honestly, it's a really cool

489
00:30:58,485 --> 00:31:01,845
Speaker 8:  idea and I want to do that. Like, I think that would be great to, you know,

490
00:31:02,065 --> 00:31:06,005
Speaker 8:  I'm playing Zelda, whatever, and you know, it's time to have

491
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:09,005
Speaker 8:  a meeting with my boss and I can just hit the button and be like, Hey, you

492
00:31:09,005 --> 00:31:12,445
Speaker 8:  know, working on this review right now and you can see me playing in the

493
00:31:12,445 --> 00:31:16,125
Speaker 8:  background. I just think that's cool. I I I totally buy it. It's just cool

494
00:31:16,515 --> 00:31:19,925
Speaker 8:  when Nintendo does it, when everybody else does it, it's like, ugh. But when

495
00:31:19,925 --> 00:31:23,045
Speaker 8:  Nintendo does it, it's cool. I'm sorry. It's just the double standard. That's

496
00:31:23,045 --> 00:31:26,005
Speaker 2:  Fair. And I'm, I'm I'm with you on it. Except I think the, the only part

497
00:31:26,005 --> 00:31:29,285
Speaker 2:  of it that makes me nervous is I think Nintendo is

498
00:31:29,945 --> 00:31:33,805
Speaker 2:  one of the last companies doing a really great job of building

499
00:31:33,805 --> 00:31:37,485
Speaker 2:  games to play by yourself. I feel like everyone else has gone to like,

500
00:31:37,485 --> 00:31:40,485
Speaker 2:  everything is a giant world. Everything is open, you're supposed to, everything

501
00:31:40,485 --> 00:31:43,925
Speaker 2:  is multiplayer all the time no matter what. And then Nintendo is just like,

502
00:31:43,925 --> 00:31:46,605
Speaker 2:  do you wanna play Mario Tennis by yourself for six hours? Like, here you

503
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:50,245
Speaker 2:  go, let's do that. And I worry, like, I think I'm, I'm probably

504
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:54,165
Speaker 2:  overshooting my fear that video chat leads to the

505
00:31:54,165 --> 00:31:57,285
Speaker 2:  death of one player games. But that is the thing I worry about.

506
00:31:57,765 --> 00:32:01,605
Speaker 8:  I disagree because I think if anything this kind of

507
00:32:02,095 --> 00:32:06,085
Speaker 8:  shows, Nintendo understands that the thing people do a

508
00:32:06,085 --> 00:32:10,005
Speaker 8:  lot nowadays is play with their friends. But some people don't wanna do that,

509
00:32:10,065 --> 00:32:14,045
Speaker 8:  but they still want the experience of, you know, communing

510
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:18,045
Speaker 8:  and this is a way to play separately together. Hmm. So, you know,

511
00:32:18,115 --> 00:32:21,885
Speaker 8:  your friend, one friend is playing Breath of the Wild, another friend is

512
00:32:21,885 --> 00:32:25,525
Speaker 8:  playing some other game. You guys can play your two separate games,

513
00:32:25,665 --> 00:32:29,605
Speaker 8:  but still like talk to each other in this interface. And I think that's what

514
00:32:29,605 --> 00:32:31,485
Speaker 8:  Nintendo is doing and I think that's really smart.

515
00:32:31,955 --> 00:32:35,565
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I, I agree. And I like the idea that It is sort of social

516
00:32:35,655 --> 00:32:39,550
Speaker 2:  first and not just game first. Exactly. Which is not how, how anybody else

517
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:42,725
Speaker 2:  does it, which I agree is, is pretty cool. It almost like, it's sort of learned

518
00:32:42,765 --> 00:32:46,525
Speaker 2:  a lesson both from multiplayer games and from Discord all at the same time

519
00:32:46,845 --> 00:32:49,765
Speaker 2:  in a way that I kind of think is, is neat. I'm with you. I also want that

520
00:32:49,765 --> 00:32:53,405
Speaker 2:  camera. I just like for the, I I I I'm with you in the sense that like, I've

521
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:55,885
Speaker 2:  put other cameras in my living room and they all creep me out and I don't

522
00:32:55,885 --> 00:32:58,885
Speaker 2:  want any of them. And then I see Nintendo's little camera on a stick and

523
00:32:58,885 --> 00:33:01,765
Speaker 2:  I'm like, well that's adorable. I would put that next to my television. Did

524
00:33:01,765 --> 00:33:05,445
Speaker 8:  You see that they are having third party cameras and one of 'em looks like

525
00:33:05,445 --> 00:33:06,685
Speaker 8:  a piranha plant. What?

526
00:33:07,025 --> 00:33:07,245
Speaker 2:  No.

527
00:33:07,245 --> 00:33:07,525
Speaker 8:  Yeah.

528
00:33:07,745 --> 00:33:08,165
Speaker 2:  Really?

529
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:12,845
Speaker 8:  Yeah, it's really cool. It's a third party one. It's in our slack, but

530
00:33:12,845 --> 00:33:15,085
Speaker 8:  it looks really cool. And I'm like, I want that.

531
00:33:16,105 --> 00:33:20,005
Speaker 2:  That's such a good idea. I I love that already. I want one that's Yoshi,

532
00:33:20,005 --> 00:33:22,205
Speaker 2:  but it's like Yoshi with his mouth open and the camera's just coming out,

533
00:33:22,205 --> 00:33:22,925
Speaker 2:  but it's tongue sitting

534
00:33:22,925 --> 00:33:24,045
Speaker 8:  Out. Oh, like an egg. That would be cute.

535
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:28,085
Speaker 2:  That'd be good. All right, so are you, you're gonna buy one of these, right?

536
00:33:28,085 --> 00:33:31,005
Speaker 2:  Like would you, you're gonna get one for professional reasons, but like,

537
00:33:31,005 --> 00:33:34,905
Speaker 2:  as as a gamer. Is this It? Is this? Yeah. We're there.

538
00:33:35,215 --> 00:33:38,625
Speaker 8:  Yeah. As a gamer, I was already sold. I'm like, yeah, like

539
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:42,825
Speaker 8:  Mario Kart world is really cool. Like, I've never had the desire to

540
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:46,385
Speaker 8:  play a Mario Kart game. Like they're fun to play with friends, but that's

541
00:33:46,385 --> 00:33:48,585
Speaker 8:  like a party game. Like, you know, you're going to a party with a bunch of

542
00:33:48,585 --> 00:33:50,745
Speaker 8:  friends and you wanna play video games, like Mario Kart is one of those games.

543
00:33:50,765 --> 00:33:54,625
Speaker 8:  But playing Mario Kart World make me like, I actually

544
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:57,825
Speaker 8:  want this, I want this for myself. I want to play this for myself. And then

545
00:33:57,825 --> 00:34:01,225
Speaker 8:  seeing all of these switch two versions of switch one games, I'm like, I

546
00:34:01,225 --> 00:34:05,065
Speaker 8:  want that too. Like I want to experience these games the way that they should

547
00:34:05,065 --> 00:34:08,905
Speaker 8:  have experienced them when they were launched. So the, the calculus has already

548
00:34:08,905 --> 00:34:10,265
Speaker 8:  been decided for me. Yeah.

549
00:34:10,545 --> 00:34:13,625
Speaker 2:  I mean I was, I was the same way that like, I was gonna end up buying this

550
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:17,025
Speaker 2:  thing no matter what. But I think the thing that's really exciting for me

551
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:20,985
Speaker 2:  is I want this thing on day one way more than I wanted the switch

552
00:34:21,045 --> 00:34:24,985
Speaker 2:  on day one. Because this thing is gonna feel huge on day one, which I

553
00:34:24,985 --> 00:34:27,705
Speaker 2:  think is like very much to Nintendo's credit, there was not that much to

554
00:34:27,705 --> 00:34:29,145
Speaker 2:  do on this switch on day one.

555
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:32,465
Speaker 8:  Yeah. That, that, that's how they get you, that's how they justify their

556
00:34:32,465 --> 00:34:36,265
Speaker 8:  450 and $500 price is because they know

557
00:34:36,355 --> 00:34:39,985
Speaker 8:  we're gonna be there no matter what because it's Nintendo

558
00:34:40,285 --> 00:34:43,945
Speaker 8:  and damn, if they don't know how to sell a console with these new bells and

559
00:34:43,945 --> 00:34:45,145
Speaker 8:  whistles, it just works.

560
00:34:45,445 --> 00:34:48,665
Speaker 2:  I'm sorry, it's a real problem. It's like watching the thing. I'm like, okay,

561
00:34:48,865 --> 00:34:52,545
Speaker 2:  you showed Mario Kart, you showed a oh oh seven trailer that showed nothing

562
00:34:52,645 --> 00:34:55,945
Speaker 2:  but is a oh oh seven game and then you ended with Donkey Kong. I'm like,

563
00:34:56,055 --> 00:34:59,625
Speaker 2:  name your price. Like I don't, I'm, I am powerless at this point. I have

564
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:00,065
Speaker 2:  nothing left.

565
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:02,345
Speaker 8:  They're really good at that.

566
00:35:03,945 --> 00:35:04,745
Speaker 2:  Ash, thank you as always.

567
00:35:05,075 --> 00:35:06,145
Speaker 8:  Thank you for having me.

568
00:35:07,885 --> 00:35:10,505
Speaker 2:  All right, we gotta take a break and then we're gonna come back and we're

569
00:35:10,505 --> 00:35:12,305
Speaker 2:  gonna talk about Microsoft. We'll be right back.

570
00:38:00,085 --> 00:38:04,025
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Tom Warren's here. Hi Tom. Hello there. You just

571
00:38:04,025 --> 00:38:07,945
Speaker 2:  made it home like very recently. Literally this morning. Yeah. Okay. So

572
00:38:07,945 --> 00:38:10,745
Speaker 2:  you, you I feel like this is a real, like I cannot be held accountable for

573
00:38:10,745 --> 00:38:14,225
Speaker 2:  any of my words on this podcast kind of thing. Yeah, this is, this is a Jet

574
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:18,185
Speaker 2:  like podcast, so if I say something wrong that's why I'm excited about

575
00:38:18,185 --> 00:38:21,945
Speaker 2:  it. So you were there for the, the occasion of Microsoft's

576
00:38:22,385 --> 00:38:26,225
Speaker 2:  50th anniversary. Yeah. And I have some like big heady Microsoft stuff I

577
00:38:26,225 --> 00:38:29,465
Speaker 2:  wanna talk about. But first just tell me about the event. This was like a,

578
00:38:29,545 --> 00:38:33,425
Speaker 2:  I would say a, a weirder wilder anniversary party than anybody expected it

579
00:38:33,425 --> 00:38:34,425
Speaker 2:  to be. What was it like to be there?

580
00:38:35,395 --> 00:38:39,245
Speaker 11:  Yeah, I wasn't really sure what it was gonna be like when I like agreed

581
00:38:39,245 --> 00:38:42,325
Speaker 11:  to go and stuff. I was like, they didn't really tell me much about it. And

582
00:38:42,325 --> 00:38:45,965
Speaker 11:  then I was like, hmm. So on the day I was thinking, oh, it's just gonna

583
00:38:45,965 --> 00:38:48,685
Speaker 11:  be like a party atmosphere and all that sort of stuff. So it, it kind of

584
00:38:48,685 --> 00:38:52,565
Speaker 11:  kicked off with like Microsoft ai, CEO,

585
00:38:53,155 --> 00:38:56,485
Speaker 11:  Mustafa Solomon. So he started talking about

586
00:38:56,605 --> 00:39:00,365
Speaker 11:  co-pilot and all the new features, all the stuff that we've covered. And

587
00:39:00,865 --> 00:39:04,125
Speaker 11:  Sat del and Microsoft CEO came on stage as well to sort of talk about the

588
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:07,965
Speaker 11:  future and, and co-pilot stuff as that was going on. Sort of,

589
00:39:08,105 --> 00:39:10,925
Speaker 11:  I'd say about 15 minutes in, we had our first protestor.

590
00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:13,045
Speaker 12:  I hear a protest. Thank you.

591
00:39:13,255 --> 00:39:17,085
Speaker 13:  Shame on you. You are war profiteer. I hear you. Stop using

592
00:39:17,385 --> 00:39:21,325
Speaker 13:  AI for genocide. Musta, stop using AI for genocide in our

593
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:25,085
Speaker 13:  region. You have blood on your hands. All of Microsoft

594
00:39:25,345 --> 00:39:29,285
Speaker 13:  has blood on its hands. How do you all celebrate when Microsoft

595
00:39:29,465 --> 00:39:30,005
Speaker 13:  is dealing?

596
00:39:31,695 --> 00:39:35,485
Speaker 11:  Which kind of like threw the whole vibe of the event off

597
00:39:35,725 --> 00:39:35,845
Speaker 11:  slightly.

598
00:39:37,365 --> 00:39:41,285
Speaker 11:  'cause obviously it was a Microsoft employee that, that that was protesting,

599
00:39:41,285 --> 00:39:44,485
Speaker 11:  which is super unusual, right? Like usually you go to a tech event and there

600
00:39:44,485 --> 00:39:47,845
Speaker 11:  might be a protester about the company's policies or, or have their technologies

601
00:39:47,915 --> 00:39:51,765
Speaker 11:  used, et cetera. But it's not usually, you know, the company's

602
00:39:52,005 --> 00:39:55,165
Speaker 11:  employee that's that's doing it. So that, that was, that was super strange.

603
00:39:56,305 --> 00:40:00,125
Speaker 11:  So yeah, that, that happened and then we quickly moved

604
00:40:00,185 --> 00:40:04,005
Speaker 11:  on to like, it was like a party atmosphere really.

605
00:40:04,225 --> 00:40:07,765
Speaker 11:  And they, they brought out Brenda song, she was like hosting it. Okay.

606
00:40:08,185 --> 00:40:11,805
Speaker 11:  And it was all, this part of it wasn't streamed live, so this was employee

607
00:40:11,915 --> 00:40:15,845
Speaker 11:  only essentially and the rest of the world's press that was in the audience.

608
00:40:16,605 --> 00:40:20,245
Speaker 11:  So yeah, she sort of hosted it. She brought up like Bill

609
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:24,085
Speaker 11:  Gates individually, Steve Barer individually, and then obviously Satya

610
00:40:24,905 --> 00:40:28,005
Speaker 11:  and then they all came on together all free. So they, they were kind of

611
00:40:28,005 --> 00:40:31,365
Speaker 11:  getting questioned individually and then all together about the history

612
00:40:31,365 --> 00:40:35,285
Speaker 11:  of Microsoft and, and all that. And Steve Bmore obviously came on,

613
00:40:35,465 --> 00:40:39,125
Speaker 11:  did his usual, you know, developers, developers, developers. We were expecting

614
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:39,205
Speaker 11:  that.

615
00:40:39,465 --> 00:40:41,525
Speaker 2:  But did he actually, he actually did the developers. Developers.

616
00:40:41,865 --> 00:40:43,045
Speaker 11:  Oh wow. She screamed it out. Yeah.

617
00:40:43,595 --> 00:40:47,005
Speaker 12:  Okay. This is something that I'm gonna get in a lot of trouble with

618
00:40:47,555 --> 00:40:50,805
Speaker 12:  with my wife who I sit see sitting there. But

619
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,285
Speaker 11:  He was like, he like looked at his wife in the audience, was like, I'm gonna

620
00:40:59,285 --> 00:41:02,765
Speaker 11:  get in trouble with my wife. And then he just immediately did it.

621
00:41:03,885 --> 00:41:06,325
Speaker 2:  I kind of love Steve Ballmer for doing it like I have to. Yeah, that was

622
00:41:06,325 --> 00:41:10,285
Speaker 2:  such a like silly moment in the history of Microsoft that I

623
00:41:10,285 --> 00:41:13,845
Speaker 2:  kind of love him for just being like, this is my legacy now. I'm I'll do

624
00:41:13,845 --> 00:41:14,565
Speaker 2:  it, I'm here for it.

625
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:18,645
Speaker 11:  If you, if you look at our video that we did of it, I think Veen or

626
00:41:18,985 --> 00:41:22,325
Speaker 11:  edited it pop like the old Ballmer on the bottom as well

627
00:41:22,865 --> 00:41:26,165
Speaker 11:  and they couldn't look further apart. Like he looks really well now as well

628
00:41:26,265 --> 00:41:29,925
Speaker 11:  and he, and he wasn't swinging, you know, buckets on stage when he did did

629
00:41:29,925 --> 00:41:31,205
Speaker 11:  it this time. So that helped. Yeah,

630
00:41:31,205 --> 00:41:33,795
Speaker 2:  It helps when you're, you have all the money in the world but don't have

631
00:41:33,795 --> 00:41:36,315
Speaker 2:  to run a company anymore. I feel like that that tends to be good for your

632
00:41:36,315 --> 00:41:36,955
Speaker 2:  health I think.

633
00:41:37,305 --> 00:41:41,075
Speaker 11:  Yeah. He also made up a new chart which he was screaming, which was

634
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:45,555
Speaker 11:  50 more, 50 more. Oh that's good. Which

635
00:41:45,555 --> 00:41:48,595
Speaker 11:  was, it was just crazy. That's really funny. Yeah, and he was, I think he

636
00:41:48,595 --> 00:41:52,035
Speaker 11:  was kind of like the highlight, if I'm honest, of the pa party

637
00:41:52,035 --> 00:41:55,955
Speaker 11:  atmosphere. So Brenda sort of interviewed them all individually and

638
00:41:55,955 --> 00:41:59,555
Speaker 11:  then Cleo Abram came on for the explain series

639
00:42:00,255 --> 00:42:03,675
Speaker 11:  to interview all three of them together. And then

640
00:42:03,985 --> 00:42:07,865
Speaker 11:  they were probably, probably about halfway through I guess that and

641
00:42:07,865 --> 00:42:11,745
Speaker 11:  another protestor, another employee protestor appeared on to the side of

642
00:42:11,745 --> 00:42:13,065
Speaker 11:  the stage. So, well I

643
00:42:13,065 --> 00:42:16,865
Speaker 15:  Think thank you all. You're all hypocrites. I'm a Microsoft worker

644
00:42:17,605 --> 00:42:18,505
Speaker 15:  and I do not

645
00:42:28,015 --> 00:42:28,305
Speaker 15:  dare

646
00:42:29,325 --> 00:42:31,665
Speaker 2:  So was your, was your sense of this whole thing that it was

647
00:42:33,215 --> 00:42:37,105
Speaker 2:  kind of a, a congratulations to us we're so fantastic thing or like

648
00:42:37,225 --> 00:42:41,105
Speaker 2:  a, you know, onward charge forward thing because it's, it's a, it's a

649
00:42:41,105 --> 00:42:43,665
Speaker 2:  weird thing to celebrate 50 years as a company. 'cause on the one hand you're

650
00:42:43,665 --> 00:42:47,305
Speaker 2:  like, well we did it, we're old and we're,

651
00:42:47,555 --> 00:42:51,425
Speaker 2:  we're we're on the down slope now. But on the other hand, it's like Microsoft

652
00:42:51,445 --> 00:42:54,185
Speaker 2:  is like bigger and more powerful maybe than it has ever been

653
00:42:54,935 --> 00:42:55,825
Speaker 11:  True. And

654
00:42:56,085 --> 00:42:59,985
Speaker 2:  In the middle of lots of change on lots of fronts. So I'm, I'm like what

655
00:42:59,985 --> 00:43:02,745
Speaker 2:  was, what's your sense of like the vibe they were going for in that sense?

656
00:43:02,855 --> 00:43:03,145
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

657
00:43:03,145 --> 00:43:06,785
Speaker 11:  The vibe is definitely, definitely party celebration vibe. Okay. Rather

658
00:43:06,785 --> 00:43:10,185
Speaker 11:  than like, you know, like the future stuff came into it quite a lot 'cause

659
00:43:10,185 --> 00:43:13,585
Speaker 11:  copilot, you know, they, they kind of tied the copilot news to this event,

660
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:17,545
Speaker 11:  so it was kind of always like linked. But yeah, no, there was a lot of like

661
00:43:17,615 --> 00:43:20,665
Speaker 11:  looking back at the old stuff and, and Bill Gates when he first appeared,

662
00:43:20,665 --> 00:43:24,585
Speaker 11:  he came on and was like nerding out, like full on nerding

663
00:43:24,585 --> 00:43:28,545
Speaker 11:  out recounting pie, you know, like it was Oh it was that sort of nerding

664
00:43:28,545 --> 00:43:32,425
Speaker 11:  out. Yeah, it was, talk about qubits. So it was, yeah, it was

665
00:43:32,425 --> 00:43:35,465
Speaker 11:  kind of, it was kind of funny. But yeah. And then they had like a, a game

666
00:43:35,465 --> 00:43:38,385
Speaker 11:  show thing where they had a few Microsoft employees come up and stuff and,

667
00:43:38,385 --> 00:43:42,305
Speaker 11:  and so, and one of one Microsoft employee won a slot on

668
00:43:42,305 --> 00:43:46,065
Speaker 11:  the front row of the party. They had to come over from some other

669
00:43:46,225 --> 00:43:50,065
Speaker 11:  building. So yeah, so it was a very game show vibe for

670
00:43:50,065 --> 00:43:50,265
Speaker 11:  sure.

671
00:43:50,865 --> 00:43:54,345
Speaker 2:  I mean I kind of get that like fifties a big thing and it also, it, it helps

672
00:43:54,345 --> 00:43:57,785
Speaker 2:  that Microsoft remains Microsoft and it's like if you're, yeah. If you're

673
00:43:57,785 --> 00:44:01,025
Speaker 2:  like, I don't know, not to pick on IBM but like this party would be a lot

674
00:44:01,025 --> 00:44:03,225
Speaker 2:  more embarrassing if it was I ibm, do you know what I

675
00:44:03,225 --> 00:44:06,225
Speaker 11:  Mean? Yeah, it's true. They're still somewhat relevant Microsoft in, in

676
00:44:06,225 --> 00:44:09,745
Speaker 11:  in many markets, but whereas yeah, IBM have gone full enterprise,

677
00:44:10,005 --> 00:44:12,945
Speaker 11:  but I think if they hadn't have done this sort of party vibe then it would've

678
00:44:12,945 --> 00:44:15,825
Speaker 11:  been a bit weird. I, I dunno what they would've done otherwise because it

679
00:44:15,825 --> 00:44:19,345
Speaker 11:  would've been like, you know, awkward Bill Gates coming on stage, Steve

680
00:44:19,455 --> 00:44:22,065
Speaker 11:  Baer like making all the noise and then Satya, who's quite like, you know,

681
00:44:22,065 --> 00:44:25,905
Speaker 11:  it's quite reserved. So, so I, I dunno how they would've treated that

682
00:44:25,905 --> 00:44:28,865
Speaker 11:  dynamic without there being like a big host, you know? Yeah. A big party.

683
00:44:28,965 --> 00:44:31,925
Speaker 11:  So I think that they kind of had to go this way either way. So Yeah,

684
00:44:31,925 --> 00:44:35,085
Speaker 2:  That makes a lot of sense. So I I do, you mentioned the co-pilot thing and

685
00:44:35,085 --> 00:44:38,005
Speaker 2:  I, I think it was really interesting to me that they tied these two things

686
00:44:38,405 --> 00:44:41,525
Speaker 2:  together that they were like, yeah, Microsoft is turning 50. It's a huge

687
00:44:41,525 --> 00:44:45,165
Speaker 2:  moment. And also we have some pretty big

688
00:44:45,585 --> 00:44:49,445
Speaker 2:  AI news, right? What do you make of that connection? Like, is this, should

689
00:44:49,685 --> 00:44:52,845
Speaker 2:  I take this as like a statement of values at Microsoft right now that like,

690
00:44:52,915 --> 00:44:56,685
Speaker 2:  this is the push to the next 50 is about AI and copilot,

691
00:44:56,705 --> 00:44:59,645
Speaker 2:  or am I just kind of overstating two things that happened to happen on the

692
00:44:59,645 --> 00:44:59,965
Speaker 2:  same day?

693
00:45:00,645 --> 00:45:03,545
Speaker 11:  No, I absolutely think so. They, they, they tied those together for a reason,

694
00:45:03,545 --> 00:45:06,545
Speaker 11:  right? And it was very much apparent that that was

695
00:45:07,275 --> 00:45:10,465
Speaker 11:  every time that Satya talked to it was, you know, about AI and, and, and

696
00:45:10,495 --> 00:45:14,425
Speaker 11:  Bill Gates joked that, you know, Microsoft has had three CEOs and

697
00:45:14,425 --> 00:45:17,625
Speaker 11:  then the next CEO EO might be co-pilot. You know, like, so there, there

698
00:45:17,625 --> 00:45:21,225
Speaker 11:  was, there was jokes and like ties to it all day regardless of that sort

699
00:45:21,225 --> 00:45:24,985
Speaker 11:  of first 30 minutes or so focusing role on it. But it very much

700
00:45:25,015 --> 00:45:28,865
Speaker 11:  felt like, yeah, copilot is our future or AI

701
00:45:28,865 --> 00:45:32,825
Speaker 11:  is our future. Yeah. Like that's our next 50 years for for sure. That

702
00:45:32,825 --> 00:45:34,585
Speaker 11:  was definitely what they were getting at. That's

703
00:45:34,585 --> 00:45:37,305
Speaker 2:  Really interesting. I mean that's a, that's a big thing to say. I guess I

704
00:45:37,305 --> 00:45:40,305
Speaker 2:  shouldn't be surprised that Microsoft is that all in on AI at this point,

705
00:45:40,325 --> 00:45:44,145
Speaker 2:  but like that's a pretty meaningful statement of purpose to make

706
00:45:44,205 --> 00:45:46,625
Speaker 2:  at an event like this where you don't have to, right? Yeah. Like you can

707
00:45:46,625 --> 00:45:50,505
Speaker 2:  make it about Windows 95, but they, like, they, they,

708
00:45:50,505 --> 00:45:53,705
Speaker 2:  it seems like they went out of their way to be like, no, we, we are an AI

709
00:45:53,705 --> 00:45:55,105
Speaker 2:  company and that is where we are going.

710
00:45:55,815 --> 00:45:59,625
Speaker 11:  Yeah, definitely. And, and they even treated it like, you know,

711
00:45:59,625 --> 00:46:02,465
Speaker 11:  like you go to a product launch like an Apple launch or Microsoft stuff

712
00:46:02,465 --> 00:46:06,185
Speaker 11:  where they have a new surface and you see it on stage and then you go hands

713
00:46:06,205 --> 00:46:09,785
Speaker 11:  on. So they had that with copilot, they had all these like pods set up with

714
00:46:09,785 --> 00:46:13,385
Speaker 11:  experiences that, with the new features that had just gone live. Like they,

715
00:46:13,385 --> 00:46:17,145
Speaker 11:  they had the muse AI model, which generates gameplay and stuff, so

716
00:46:17,325 --> 00:46:20,785
Speaker 11:  you could check that out. Copilot vision. And they, that copilot vision

717
00:46:20,985 --> 00:46:24,745
Speaker 11:  actually was an interesting one because that one is

718
00:46:24,745 --> 00:46:28,265
Speaker 11:  obviously open now, has done it, Apple's doing it, visual intelligence,

719
00:46:28,805 --> 00:46:31,665
Speaker 11:  all that sort of stuff. But it's interesting how Microsoft's doing it because

720
00:46:32,975 --> 00:46:36,745
Speaker 11:  it's like constantly rolling so it knows you don't have to like constantly

721
00:46:36,845 --> 00:46:40,745
Speaker 11:  hit a button or like really focus it at something very

722
00:46:40,745 --> 00:46:44,345
Speaker 11:  obvious for it to pick it up. Like I had one example where I had a game,

723
00:46:44,345 --> 00:46:47,905
Speaker 11:  there was a game boy in front of me and I was like, tell me how to power

724
00:46:47,925 --> 00:46:51,225
Speaker 11:  the game boy on. And it was like, I'll pop, you know the batteries in the

725
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:54,105
Speaker 11:  back and then you flick the switch at the top. So I flick the switch at

726
00:46:54,105 --> 00:46:57,185
Speaker 11:  the top and it was like, oh, you've turned it on. 'cause it realized that

727
00:46:57,185 --> 00:47:01,105
Speaker 11:  the LED had lit up. Oh, wow. Or, or it just assumed I was doing

728
00:47:01,105 --> 00:47:04,985
Speaker 11:  that and just, yeah. And guessed. But that was an interesting

729
00:47:04,985 --> 00:47:08,905
Speaker 11:  one. I was like, okay, this is really, does feel like it's watching what

730
00:47:08,905 --> 00:47:09,985
Speaker 11:  you're watching. Yeah.

731
00:47:09,985 --> 00:47:13,865
Speaker 2:  It was really interesting to see the, the copilot stuff. It is kind of just

732
00:47:13,865 --> 00:47:17,625
Speaker 2:  like a grab bag of all of everybody else's ideas about ai.

733
00:47:17,905 --> 00:47:21,665
Speaker 2:  And I don't mean that as like a denigration of any of this. Like it

734
00:47:21,665 --> 00:47:24,385
Speaker 2:  everybody has the same ideas. Right. So I think it's fine. Yeah. But it was

735
00:47:24,385 --> 00:47:27,305
Speaker 2:  like, they did the shopping stuff. They're, they're doing some age agentic

736
00:47:27,305 --> 00:47:30,700
Speaker 2:  stuff. They had the, the sort of of multimodal vision stuff. It's just like,

737
00:47:30,715 --> 00:47:34,605
Speaker 2:  yeah, Microsoft keeps doing this thing that like slightly drives

738
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:37,805
Speaker 2:  me crazy where they're like, actually copilot is a million things. Yeah.

739
00:47:37,805 --> 00:47:40,445
Speaker 2:  And then they're like, nevermind, copilot is one thing. And then they're

740
00:47:40,445 --> 00:47:43,125
Speaker 2:  like, nevermind it's a million things. And this felt like another sort of

741
00:47:43,125 --> 00:47:46,285
Speaker 2:  bring all the copilots back together and they're like, this is, we want to

742
00:47:46,285 --> 00:47:50,245
Speaker 2:  make sort of one holistic thing out of all of these many

743
00:47:50,525 --> 00:47:51,685
Speaker 2:  features inside of copilot.

744
00:47:52,195 --> 00:47:55,965
Speaker 11:  Yeah. It always feels like they're like almost one step behind because they

745
00:47:55,965 --> 00:47:59,645
Speaker 11:  take the open AI model. So open air does their streams and you know,

746
00:47:59,795 --> 00:48:03,125
Speaker 11:  wows everyone with the new features. And then Microsoft sort of rolls 'em

747
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:06,205
Speaker 11:  out like a couple of months later or something. So this was very much that,

748
00:48:06,605 --> 00:48:08,765
Speaker 11:  although it's, it's always interesting how they roll them out 'cause it

749
00:48:08,765 --> 00:48:12,605
Speaker 11:  does feel like they do them in a slightly better way and a better

750
00:48:12,635 --> 00:48:15,965
Speaker 11:  user experience, which is not usually what Microsoft does. So,

751
00:48:16,995 --> 00:48:19,645
Speaker 11:  yeah. So they, they are doing pretty good with, with how they're rolling

752
00:48:19,645 --> 00:48:23,445
Speaker 11:  it out. But yeah, you're right. It's, It is like taking the, the top features

753
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:27,005
Speaker 11:  of what everyone else has got. Yeah. And then polishing them essentially.

754
00:48:27,095 --> 00:48:27,445
Speaker 11:  Which

755
00:48:27,445 --> 00:48:30,365
Speaker 2:  Is not, I mean that is, to be fair, that's like, that's also Google strategy

756
00:48:30,745 --> 00:48:32,765
Speaker 2:  and Apple strategy. Yeah. And it's just

757
00:48:32,765 --> 00:48:34,765
Speaker 11:  Like everyone's doing the same, take the,

758
00:48:34,765 --> 00:48:38,325
Speaker 2:  Take the good ideas and roll them into your bigger products. It it does kind

759
00:48:38,325 --> 00:48:41,325
Speaker 2:  of work. Yeah. So you've spent a bunch of time over the last few weeks sort

760
00:48:41,325 --> 00:48:44,805
Speaker 2:  of reckoning with Microsoft at 50 and this is a company you've been covering

761
00:48:44,805 --> 00:48:48,045
Speaker 2:  for a really long time. And I'm curious like how,

762
00:48:48,495 --> 00:48:52,325
Speaker 2:  where sort of Microsoft is in, in your head right now. Like do you have

763
00:48:52,325 --> 00:48:56,285
Speaker 2:  sort of a grand theory of five decades of Microsoft coming out of all of

764
00:48:56,285 --> 00:48:57,525
Speaker 2:  this retrospective and research?

765
00:48:58,355 --> 00:49:02,285
Speaker 11:  Yeah, I think I wrote about like reflection of

766
00:49:02,285 --> 00:49:05,605
Speaker 11:  the last 50 years and, and like what Microsoft's kind of stood for and,

767
00:49:05,605 --> 00:49:09,405
Speaker 11:  and where they are now. And I think It is a matter of, they were obviously

768
00:49:09,515 --> 00:49:13,405
Speaker 11:  born as micro soft, which is like, you know, microcomputers and

769
00:49:13,645 --> 00:49:17,525
Speaker 11:  software and I think we're still sort of in that era, but

770
00:49:17,525 --> 00:49:20,565
Speaker 11:  it's, it's just they're very focused on software now. Mm.

771
00:49:21,475 --> 00:49:23,965
Speaker 11:  They do have, you know, surface and stuff, but they, they, they seem to

772
00:49:23,965 --> 00:49:27,605
Speaker 11:  be kind of playing it safe with that stuff. And then you've got Xbox, which

773
00:49:27,605 --> 00:49:31,085
Speaker 11:  obviously was a big one of their hardware hits and that's kind of going

774
00:49:31,085 --> 00:49:34,165
Speaker 11:  in the software direction as well. And it's obviously going, going towards

775
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:37,845
Speaker 11:  AI as well. And then you've obviously got the AI push as well, which is

776
00:49:37,845 --> 00:49:41,645
Speaker 11:  driven partly by, by hardware advances and a lot by

777
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:45,725
Speaker 11:  software at the moment as well. So I think it's keeping true to

778
00:49:45,725 --> 00:49:49,165
Speaker 11:  that software stuff where Mike thought is gonna go, I spoke to

779
00:49:49,785 --> 00:49:53,685
Speaker 11:  one of their, he, he described himself as this mad scientist, deep Stevie

780
00:49:53,725 --> 00:49:57,405
Speaker 11:  B is, is what we call him. And he

781
00:49:57,445 --> 00:50:01,245
Speaker 11:  basically broke it down in the, in in the sense of like, Microsoft would

782
00:50:01,245 --> 00:50:05,165
Speaker 11:  write traditionally write code once, right? So, so say they shipped

783
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:09,125
Speaker 11:  Word, they'd write that piece of code and then someone would install

784
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:12,605
Speaker 11:  it and maybe customize it however they want. Now they have to write a piece

785
00:50:12,605 --> 00:50:16,405
Speaker 11:  of code for every person on the planet to use their software

786
00:50:16,475 --> 00:50:19,525
Speaker 11:  with, with ai. So they're kind of like, that's the way they're looking at

787
00:50:19,525 --> 00:50:23,405
Speaker 11:  it in this like agent push so that you'll have your own personal

788
00:50:23,495 --> 00:50:26,925
Speaker 11:  agent that knows you and that's built for you.

789
00:50:27,825 --> 00:50:31,445
Speaker 11:  So that's obviously a different, a very much a different challenge to how

790
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:35,365
Speaker 11:  they've built software before. So I think they're the early phases of that.

791
00:50:35,505 --> 00:50:39,485
Speaker 11:  And like e even Stevie, like admit there's a

792
00:50:39,485 --> 00:50:43,165
Speaker 11:  bunch of AI concepts out there, even Microsoft's doing them, but no one's

793
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:46,645
Speaker 11:  really kind of put them all together. And I think that's really where Microsoft's

794
00:50:46,645 --> 00:50:50,405
Speaker 11:  gonna go for the next sort of 10 years is figuring out all those

795
00:50:50,835 --> 00:50:54,125
Speaker 11:  distant concepts, bringing 'em together and then putting them in something

796
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:55,725
Speaker 11:  that is a lot more coherent.

797
00:50:56,195 --> 00:50:59,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Well I think there, there's an interesting sort of parallel between

798
00:51:00,475 --> 00:51:04,365
Speaker 2:  that and I actually think that's, that's about as sort of clean a straight

799
00:51:04,365 --> 00:51:07,245
Speaker 2:  line as I've heard someone draw through Microsoft that It is like fundamentally

800
00:51:07,245 --> 00:51:11,125
Speaker 2:  this is like a, It is a software company that actually sort of thinks about

801
00:51:11,125 --> 00:51:15,005
Speaker 2:  people in a very coherent way across time. But then

802
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:18,365
Speaker 2:  like I look at, you know, we did the, the 50 best things Microsoft has ever

803
00:51:18,365 --> 00:51:22,045
Speaker 2:  made and, and you ran down a bunch of kind of the the weird ideas that it's

804
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:25,205
Speaker 2:  had over time. And also this is a company that is just like fundamentally

805
00:51:25,225 --> 00:51:29,045
Speaker 2:  all over the place all the time. And yeah, they have tried so many things.

806
00:51:29,555 --> 00:51:32,965
Speaker 2:  Some of them have worked in huge ways, some of them have not. And I think

807
00:51:33,225 --> 00:51:37,045
Speaker 2:  it was really interesting to read 'cause I don't think about Microsoft as

808
00:51:38,085 --> 00:51:42,045
Speaker 2:  a sort of wacky experimental company in the way that like when

809
00:51:42,105 --> 00:51:45,925
Speaker 2:  Amazon launches a hundred things running Alexa, right? Nobody thinks that's

810
00:51:45,925 --> 00:51:49,205
Speaker 2:  weird, right? That sort of culturally makes sense inside of Amazon. And when

811
00:51:49,205 --> 00:51:52,845
Speaker 2:  Google is like, here's 17 new messaging apps, you're like, oh Google. But

812
00:51:52,845 --> 00:51:55,165
Speaker 2:  I don't think Microsoft has quite that same

813
00:51:56,255 --> 00:51:59,885
Speaker 2:  reputation and yet it has tried and failed at

814
00:51:59,935 --> 00:52:03,645
Speaker 2:  maybe more big things than almost anybody. And I think

815
00:52:03,825 --> 00:52:07,605
Speaker 2:  one of the things that you argued is that Microsoft's sort of core competency

816
00:52:07,605 --> 00:52:11,565
Speaker 2:  is that it, it actually like moves and pivots really fast. And so it's

817
00:52:11,565 --> 00:52:13,725
Speaker 2:  just been, it was so interesting to just see those two things against each

818
00:52:13,725 --> 00:52:16,965
Speaker 2:  other. It's like Microsoft kind of had one idea 50 years ago that it was

819
00:52:16,995 --> 00:52:20,445
Speaker 2:  even more right about than it realized and it has carried it all the way

820
00:52:20,445 --> 00:52:22,885
Speaker 2:  through and then around the edges it's just like pure chaos.

821
00:52:23,635 --> 00:52:27,605
Speaker 11:  Yeah, It is. It's it's tried to respond sometimes successfully.

822
00:52:28,315 --> 00:52:31,165
Speaker 11:  Like I'd say when they moved to the cloud that was, that was obviously very

823
00:52:31,165 --> 00:52:33,885
Speaker 11:  successful and it's kind of set them up for where they are now. And it's

824
00:52:33,885 --> 00:52:37,245
Speaker 11:  sometimes like spectacularly unsuccessfully, like missing the mobile era,

825
00:52:37,245 --> 00:52:39,965
Speaker 11:  which probably cost them, I think 'cause the estimate is like 600 billion

826
00:52:40,105 --> 00:52:43,405
Speaker 11:  or something. So quite a lot of money. Well

827
00:52:43,405 --> 00:52:44,045
Speaker 2:  You put it like that.

828
00:52:44,555 --> 00:52:48,205
Speaker 11:  Yeah. Okay. So yeah, but they've navigated

829
00:52:48,205 --> 00:52:51,765
Speaker 11:  throughout those like sort of eras. I I, I'd break them down really by

830
00:52:52,115 --> 00:52:54,725
Speaker 11:  CEOs to be honest. 'cause you had the Bill Gates era, which is the PC on

831
00:52:54,725 --> 00:52:58,365
Speaker 11:  every desk and Steve Bomber, which was kind of like the cloud and launching

832
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:02,325
Speaker 11:  Xbox and all that sort of stuff. And then you had sat Nadella, which was

833
00:53:02,435 --> 00:53:05,605
Speaker 11:  very, which is very much the AI in the era now. Yeah. And, and sort of resetting

834
00:53:05,605 --> 00:53:09,365
Speaker 11:  their culture as well. But yeah, they, they've navigated interestingly

835
00:53:09,365 --> 00:53:12,045
Speaker 11:  throughout that 'cause there's so many things they've done like connect,

836
00:53:12,475 --> 00:53:16,245
Speaker 11:  like the Zoom, like Barney toys. There's,

837
00:53:16,245 --> 00:53:18,885
Speaker 11:  there's just so much that they've kind of experimented with. But I think

838
00:53:19,705 --> 00:53:23,125
Speaker 11:  my point when I wrote about some of that stuff is that even though some

839
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:27,055
Speaker 11:  of those things are like blatant failures, like connect like

840
00:53:27,055 --> 00:53:31,015
Speaker 11:  the HoloLens is that they take parts of that technology and then they

841
00:53:31,015 --> 00:53:34,495
Speaker 11:  use it elsewhere. So it's like they are learning from those mistakes and

842
00:53:34,495 --> 00:53:37,495
Speaker 11:  then they'll be like, well all the silicon work we've done on HoloLens is

843
00:53:37,495 --> 00:53:40,655
Speaker 11:  now our quantum work. Oh, interesting. The the connect stuff, you know,

844
00:53:40,725 --> 00:53:44,615
Speaker 11:  like some of that early connect work went into Windows. Hello.

845
00:53:44,665 --> 00:53:47,895
Speaker 11:  Where you look at your laptop and it signs you in now. So there's all these,

846
00:53:47,895 --> 00:53:51,855
Speaker 11:  there's all these sort of like through lines and even Cortana like help

847
00:53:51,855 --> 00:53:54,975
Speaker 11:  them do the surface Pro X and some of the windows on arm stuff with windows

848
00:53:54,985 --> 00:53:58,575
Speaker 11:  phone. So it's, there's yeah, there's, there's always failures, but then

849
00:53:58,575 --> 00:54:02,295
Speaker 11:  there's successes through those failures, which is also, I don't think it's

850
00:54:02,295 --> 00:54:05,335
Speaker 11:  very obvious when you look at the product you think that was a massive flop.

851
00:54:05,555 --> 00:54:09,335
Speaker 11:  And it's like, yes, it was, but it also, you know, went on some like

852
00:54:09,335 --> 00:54:12,815
Speaker 11:  Skype helped power Microsoft teams. Like there's, there's so many instances

853
00:54:12,835 --> 00:54:15,935
Speaker 11:  of it. You could, you could make up another 50 lists. So. Yeah.

854
00:54:15,965 --> 00:54:19,615
Speaker 2:  Well, and I think that's, that actually speaks really well of Microsoft's

855
00:54:19,615 --> 00:54:23,575
Speaker 2:  culture. And I think Microsoft, Microsoft's culture has been,

856
00:54:24,095 --> 00:54:28,055
Speaker 2:  I would say fairly correctly raked over the coals several times over

857
00:54:28,055 --> 00:54:31,455
Speaker 2:  the years. But that, that fact, 'cause this is the thing we see a lot at

858
00:54:31,455 --> 00:54:34,975
Speaker 2:  other companies. Something goes wrong, everybody leaves or gets fired and

859
00:54:34,975 --> 00:54:38,095
Speaker 2:  all the work that they did just sort of gets mothballed. They're like, well

860
00:54:38,095 --> 00:54:41,055
Speaker 2:  this is a mistake. Yeah. Moving on. We're gonna, we're gonna go over this

861
00:54:41,055 --> 00:54:44,295
Speaker 2:  way now. And they sort of overcorrect in the wrong direction and some and

862
00:54:44,355 --> 00:54:48,015
Speaker 2:  try something else. Right? And so that ability of Microsoft to actually like,

863
00:54:48,395 --> 00:54:51,935
Speaker 2:  say like, okay, this thing didn't work, but what did we do that might work

864
00:54:51,935 --> 00:54:55,735
Speaker 2:  somewhere else. It is actually a, it's a hard thing to do and it's, it's

865
00:54:55,735 --> 00:54:59,535
Speaker 2:  impressive that Microsoft has done that so well so many times over the years.

866
00:54:59,725 --> 00:55:03,455
Speaker 11:  Yeah, It is. And when I spoke to Stevie B for that, for that story,

867
00:55:03,515 --> 00:55:07,335
Speaker 11:  it was, it was funny just going through the years of like, because

868
00:55:07,435 --> 00:55:10,695
Speaker 11:  he, he's been instrumental to a lot of the stuff like the touch computing,

869
00:55:10,695 --> 00:55:13,095
Speaker 11:  like even, you know, do you remember the first surface table that they did?

870
00:55:13,595 --> 00:55:14,175
Speaker 2:  Oh yeah. Where

871
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,935
Speaker 11:  They had it at like Cs and it was like the

872
00:55:16,015 --> 00:55:17,335
Speaker 2:  Like pool table looking thing. Yeah,

873
00:55:17,485 --> 00:55:21,335
Speaker 11:  Yeah, yeah. And then they eventually had it in like a bunch of Vegas restaurants

874
00:55:21,335 --> 00:55:24,215
Speaker 11:  and stuff. It was, yeah, it was wild. But he, he was the instrumental tool

875
00:55:24,215 --> 00:55:26,975
Speaker 11:  of that sort of stuff and, and helping with connect and, and everything.

876
00:55:27,035 --> 00:55:30,215
Speaker 11:  But when I spoke to him, it was interesting because he, he went through

877
00:55:30,215 --> 00:55:33,375
Speaker 11:  all the sort of successes and the failures and how they experiment with

878
00:55:33,575 --> 00:55:36,415
Speaker 11:  hardware and software. And then I, and then I was like, what is your favorite,

879
00:55:36,445 --> 00:55:39,255
Speaker 11:  like paint? And he's sitting in his office and he is like,

880
00:55:40,275 --> 00:55:43,935
Speaker 11:  and then he just reaches down and like clears like a path to the bottom

881
00:55:43,935 --> 00:55:47,535
Speaker 11:  of his shelf and It is all the paint cubes are sin. Oh wow. He's like pulling

882
00:55:47,535 --> 00:55:51,375
Speaker 11:  him up going, I like this one and this one led to whatever. That's pretty

883
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:53,975
Speaker 11:  cool. And he was just like, yeah, it was, it was just interesting seeing

884
00:55:53,995 --> 00:55:56,935
Speaker 11:  the sort of like, 'cause he's been there for so long, it's just interesting

885
00:55:56,935 --> 00:56:00,695
Speaker 11:  seeing the, the various stuff that they have patented and how

886
00:56:00,695 --> 00:56:04,655
Speaker 11:  they've, you know, they've learned from those, those failures. Yeah. If

887
00:56:04,655 --> 00:56:07,895
Speaker 2:  You will. Well it's also, I, going back through that list of 50 things is

888
00:56:07,895 --> 00:56:11,335
Speaker 2:  like, it, it keeps occurring to me that maybe no company

889
00:56:11,715 --> 00:56:15,375
Speaker 2:  in tech is better at missing by a little bit than

890
00:56:15,655 --> 00:56:19,455
Speaker 2:  Microsoft. Yeah. Like Microsoft has been almost right so many

891
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:23,365
Speaker 2:  times. Yeah, I was looking, it's like, like Clippy is just

892
00:56:23,365 --> 00:56:26,885
Speaker 2:  what we're doing now, right? Like Microsoft has been trying to do this thing

893
00:56:26,945 --> 00:56:30,445
Speaker 2:  in various iterations for forever. That's true. And it, it, it, it was in

894
00:56:30,445 --> 00:56:32,245
Speaker 2:  the right place at totally the wrong time.

895
00:56:32,625 --> 00:56:36,405
Speaker 11:  Here's, here's something that Stevie said. He said, everyone is right if

896
00:56:36,405 --> 00:56:37,205
Speaker 11:  you wait long enough.

897
00:56:38,385 --> 00:56:41,405
Speaker 2:  So Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, and there's like, and there's a million

898
00:56:41,605 --> 00:56:44,365
Speaker 2:  of those like what was the, what was the smartwatch that Microsoft was working

899
00:56:44,365 --> 00:56:45,125
Speaker 2:  on like way before

900
00:56:45,185 --> 00:56:46,485
Speaker 11:  The spot stuff? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

901
00:56:46,935 --> 00:56:50,805
Speaker 2:  Right idea, wrong time and the tablets and the HoloLens. Yeah. And

902
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:54,565
Speaker 2:  Cortana, it's like Microsoft is is always just 10

903
00:56:54,565 --> 00:56:58,165
Speaker 2:  degrees off. Yeah. And it fits every time and then it occasionally hits it,

904
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:01,165
Speaker 2:  right? Like with the Xbox and you, you see what happens and it hit it right

905
00:57:01,165 --> 00:57:04,245
Speaker 2:  with Azure and you see what happens and it's just,

906
00:57:05,075 --> 00:57:08,925
Speaker 2:  it's track record of almost hitting and just missing is like

907
00:57:08,955 --> 00:57:10,365
Speaker 2:  epic over its history.

908
00:57:11,105 --> 00:57:13,725
Speaker 11:  But this, I guess it's the same for anything, isn't it? Right. Place at

909
00:57:13,725 --> 00:57:16,405
Speaker 11:  the right time is just so, such a, like a common thing.

910
00:57:17,635 --> 00:57:21,405
Speaker 11:  Yeah. They, they've definitely had the right ideas, but yeah, the timing

911
00:57:21,505 --> 00:57:25,325
Speaker 11:  has has definitely been not quite right. So, but look at like HoloLens,

912
00:57:25,325 --> 00:57:29,285
Speaker 11:  that was like, that was like genuinely like wow moment when I tried that

913
00:57:29,285 --> 00:57:32,805
Speaker 11:  on, I was like, I couldn't believe it. And then 10 years later and

914
00:57:32,865 --> 00:57:35,725
Speaker 11:  Meta's still trying to make that, that sort of experience of reality, right?

915
00:57:35,745 --> 00:57:36,845
Speaker 11:  So it's not easy.

916
00:57:37,425 --> 00:57:40,205
Speaker 2:  No. And it's, it's, there's so many of like did you ever watch that General

917
00:57:40,205 --> 00:57:44,125
Speaker 2:  Magic documentary? No, I didn't. It's very good. I recommend it.

918
00:57:44,405 --> 00:57:48,285
Speaker 2:  I'll put the link in the show notes. But it was basically this group of

919
00:57:48,285 --> 00:57:52,245
Speaker 2:  people in like the early nineties who built a cell phone

920
00:57:52,305 --> 00:57:55,965
Speaker 2:  and it, it had, it had all of the ideas that smartphones would later

921
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:58,805
Speaker 2:  have. They were just trying to build an iPhone, but they were trying to ship

922
00:57:58,805 --> 00:58:02,765
Speaker 2:  the thing 13 years before the iPhone and the world wasn't ready, the technology

923
00:58:02,765 --> 00:58:06,565
Speaker 2:  wasn't ready and it was like, oh, everyone saw it. And it's just a

924
00:58:06,565 --> 00:58:09,045
Speaker 2:  matter of like being the one who makes the right thing at the right time,

925
00:58:09,045 --> 00:58:12,885
Speaker 2:  that is actually what hits. And it's not like some magical

926
00:58:12,885 --> 00:58:15,645
Speaker 2:  thing just happened. And I feel like there's so much of this in Microsoft's

927
00:58:15,645 --> 00:58:19,405
Speaker 2:  history that is like, somebody sitting in the building was right.

928
00:58:19,835 --> 00:58:23,765
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And they just, they just didn't, they were, they were too early

929
00:58:23,945 --> 00:58:27,245
Speaker 2:  or they were like, they missed one piece of the thing that wasn't quite right.

930
00:58:28,315 --> 00:58:31,965
Speaker 2:  They just, they just were one turn away from having it. Right. And there's

931
00:58:31,965 --> 00:58:35,645
Speaker 2:  like, there's a fascinating like apple like hardware story that

932
00:58:35,705 --> 00:58:38,125
Speaker 2:  almost happened inside of Microsoft. Like almost.

933
00:58:38,835 --> 00:58:42,045
Speaker 11:  Yeah. It's, it's like the ebb and flow of software and hardware, isn't it?

934
00:58:42,045 --> 00:58:45,645
Speaker 11:  You get those hardware advances and that software that you were trying to

935
00:58:45,645 --> 00:58:49,405
Speaker 11:  build, you know, a decade ago then becomes suddenly very relevant like

936
00:58:49,555 --> 00:58:52,765
Speaker 11:  Cortana and Clippy and stuff. Like that's, that now

937
00:58:53,745 --> 00:58:57,085
Speaker 11:  is where, where you could do a personal system, it would actually make sense.

938
00:58:57,195 --> 00:59:00,405
Speaker 11:  Totally. Which, funny enough, that's all exactly what they're doing again,

939
00:59:00,975 --> 00:59:04,765
Speaker 11:  which they kind of teased on stage at this 50th anniversary. Oh really?

940
00:59:04,765 --> 00:59:07,885
Speaker 11:  They, they're, yeah, they're bringing like characters to co-pilots. You

941
00:59:07,885 --> 00:59:11,565
Speaker 11:  have your individual and it visually will look different. So

942
00:59:12,165 --> 00:59:15,485
Speaker 2:  I feel like they can't get away with bringing Clippy back. I just think it

943
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:18,205
Speaker 2:  would be, that's like a funny joke, but I don't think you can do that seriously.

944
00:59:18,505 --> 00:59:21,245
Speaker 2:  But I think they could bring Bob back, right? You could, you could do Bob

945
00:59:21,245 --> 00:59:21,525
Speaker 2:  again.

946
00:59:21,955 --> 00:59:25,085
Speaker 11:  Yeah, well they did show Clippy at the end of the montage of characters

947
00:59:25,725 --> 00:59:29,625
Speaker 11:  and I don't know if that means the paperclip is

948
00:59:29,625 --> 00:59:31,385
Speaker 11:  back or, I dunno,

949
00:59:31,975 --> 00:59:35,905
Speaker 2:  That would be the, the true ultimate sign of confidence in AI is

950
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:39,745
Speaker 2:  like, we we're doing clippy again, but we're we're doing it well this time.

951
00:59:40,135 --> 00:59:41,665
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It's like, it's, that's

952
00:59:41,865 --> 00:59:45,465
Speaker 11:  I feel, I feel like they do it just to get people to download copilot

953
00:59:46,185 --> 00:59:48,945
Speaker 11:  because that's gonna, like everyone will write the headline about that.

954
00:59:48,945 --> 00:59:52,025
Speaker 2:  Right. So I mean, I would use it, I would, I would spend one whole day with

955
00:59:52,205 --> 00:59:53,785
Speaker 2:  new clippy for sure. I get it. Yes.

956
00:59:53,785 --> 00:59:55,305
Speaker 11:  You can now talk to Clippy. Right.

957
00:59:56,405 --> 01:00:00,305
Speaker 2:  I'd be down, I'm ready for it. So I'm

958
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:03,225
Speaker 2:  really fascinated by this moment of like seeing the three different eras

959
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:05,905
Speaker 2:  and the three different CEOs sort of sitting next to each other on stage.

960
01:00:05,905 --> 01:00:08,825
Speaker 2:  And like you described, there's three very different people who ran the company

961
01:00:08,825 --> 01:00:11,945
Speaker 2:  three very different ways, but it still kind of keeps being

962
01:00:13,025 --> 01:00:15,745
Speaker 2:  Microsoft and obviously there's no indication that Satya Nadel is going anywhere

963
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:19,105
Speaker 2:  anytime soon. No, he's, he's

964
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:22,865
Speaker 2:  relatively young. He's doing very well. Company's going fine. Like I feel

965
01:00:22,865 --> 01:00:26,465
Speaker 2:  like that is that dude's job for a long time. Yeah. But what, what is your

966
01:00:26,465 --> 01:00:30,265
Speaker 2:  sense of kind of the next turn for Microsoft? Is there, is there some

967
01:00:30,605 --> 01:00:34,505
Speaker 2:  big shift coming or we in the middle of it already because it's the AI

968
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:34,745
Speaker 2:  story?

969
01:00:35,775 --> 01:00:38,745
Speaker 11:  Yeah, I think, I think we're in the middle of it if I'm honest. It's just

970
01:00:38,845 --> 01:00:42,505
Speaker 11:  the way they talk about it and the investments they're making is clear

971
01:00:43,175 --> 01:00:46,345
Speaker 11:  that that's their next big bet and they do these big bets

972
01:00:46,865 --> 01:00:50,345
Speaker 11:  occasionally. They got kind of go all in because, and I think

973
01:00:50,725 --> 01:00:53,545
Speaker 11:  we saw it with the augmented reality stuff and then HoloLens and stuff.

974
01:00:53,545 --> 01:00:56,905
Speaker 11:  They really went for that because they, they genuinely thought, you know,

975
01:00:57,175 --> 01:00:58,745
Speaker 11:  computing was gonna go in that direction.

976
01:00:58,805 --> 01:01:01,185
Speaker 2:  Do you think, was that at the same level as this though? I was trying to

977
01:01:01,185 --> 01:01:04,065
Speaker 2:  think like what, what in their history feels as

978
01:01:05,045 --> 01:01:08,985
Speaker 2:  big a swing as AI does right now? And like I cloud definitely Cloud one

979
01:01:08,985 --> 01:01:10,425
Speaker 11:  Is Yeah. Is the only one, isn't it? The

980
01:01:10,425 --> 01:01:14,305
Speaker 2:  Whole Azure thing. And I was, I was debating this with HoloLens

981
01:01:14,305 --> 01:01:16,785
Speaker 2:  and ar 'cause they certainly made a lot of noise about it, but there wasn't,

982
01:01:16,785 --> 01:01:20,385
Speaker 2:  it didn't feel like the future of Microsoft was

983
01:01:20,765 --> 01:01:23,825
Speaker 2:  inside of HoloLens in the way that it does with AI to me. But I don't know,

984
01:01:23,825 --> 01:01:24,865
Speaker 2:  maybe, maybe you feel differently.

985
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:27,545
Speaker 11:  They did like a big swing with Windows eight. That's

986
01:01:27,545 --> 01:01:27,665
Speaker 2:  True.

987
01:01:27,815 --> 01:01:31,465
Speaker 11:  They really tried to, to make it so that apps would go across phone and

988
01:01:31,695 --> 01:01:35,065
Speaker 11:  exports and that and that, that that failed spectacularly. Yes, it did.

989
01:01:35,265 --> 01:01:36,385
Speaker 11:  Especially the design.

990
01:01:36,765 --> 01:01:39,985
Speaker 2:  But another one, I I this is, this is the hottest take I will say on this

991
01:01:39,985 --> 01:01:43,105
Speaker 2:  entire podcast. I think history will be kind to Windows eight. I think Windows

992
01:01:43,105 --> 01:01:43,985
Speaker 2:  eight had some good ideas.

993
01:01:44,605 --> 01:01:47,665
Speaker 11:  It did, yeah. It did have good ideas. It was just, it was just too much

994
01:01:47,765 --> 01:01:51,545
Speaker 11:  for the, you know, the traditional power users of Windows. So

995
01:01:51,735 --> 01:01:54,945
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I think if they had done like Windows 11 and then 10 and then eight,

996
01:01:55,205 --> 01:01:56,385
Speaker 2:  it might have worked a lot better.

997
01:01:56,745 --> 01:01:57,185
Speaker 11:  Yeah. Maybe

998
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:59,825
Speaker 2:  Instead of, instead they're just like doing it in reverse. Yeah,

999
01:02:00,055 --> 01:02:03,985
Speaker 11:  Yeah. But it, it definitely feels like AI

1000
01:02:03,985 --> 01:02:07,425
Speaker 11:  is their natural next sort of transformation. Yeah.

1001
01:02:08,085 --> 01:02:11,425
Speaker 11:  It was interesting just all three CEOs being on stage, like you were saying,

1002
01:02:12,285 --> 01:02:15,465
Speaker 11:  and them trying to interact with each other and you could, they, they were

1003
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:19,285
Speaker 11:  talking about, you know, the the hits and misses and what they

1004
01:02:19,285 --> 01:02:23,125
Speaker 11:  liked about each other, which Bill Gates was like, I like

1005
01:02:23,125 --> 01:02:26,485
Speaker 11:  the fact that Steve Palmer and SATs and de are good with people.

1006
01:02:27,435 --> 01:02:31,245
Speaker 11:  It's like, which is funny. That's pretty good. And and Steve

1007
01:02:31,245 --> 01:02:34,285
Speaker 11:  Palmer was like, just Satya doing a great job because he is like, you know,

1008
01:02:34,715 --> 01:02:38,325
Speaker 11:  tripled my stock. So that's real. Yeah. Which is, which is true.

1009
01:02:39,225 --> 01:02:43,205
Speaker 11:  But they, they all, they all kind of talked, well, especially Bet

1010
01:02:43,205 --> 01:02:46,805
Speaker 11:  Gates talked about AI and he's made some pretty big statements about

1011
01:02:46,985 --> 01:02:50,805
Speaker 11:  ai, you know, replacing jobs and stuff, which I don't think many

1012
01:02:50,805 --> 01:02:54,765
Speaker 11:  technologists are, are kind of exactly agreeing on right now.

1013
01:02:55,075 --> 01:02:58,005
Speaker 11:  Yeah. I've got the sense that AI is the, the next transformation and that's,

1014
01:02:58,005 --> 01:03:00,565
Speaker 11:  that's where they're putting everything. Like they, they're putting $80 billion

1015
01:03:00,585 --> 01:03:04,525
Speaker 11:  in, right? Yeah. And they had like a town hall a few weeks ago where they,

1016
01:03:04,695 --> 01:03:07,565
Speaker 11:  where they talked to employees about it all and employees were kind of like

1017
01:03:07,765 --> 01:03:11,645
Speaker 11:  challenging them on why are we investing so much money in this

1018
01:03:11,825 --> 01:03:15,285
Speaker 11:  AI thing? And they were like, well we have 300 billion

1019
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:19,125
Speaker 11:  of contracts that are lined up for the next few years. So, and, and a lot

1020
01:03:19,125 --> 01:03:22,845
Speaker 11:  of those involve cloud and ai so we're gonna get our

1021
01:03:22,845 --> 01:03:24,605
Speaker 11:  return essentially is what they're saying. So

1022
01:03:24,865 --> 01:03:28,125
Speaker 2:  That's really interesting. Yeah, and I think if you're Microsoft,

1023
01:03:29,545 --> 01:03:33,325
Speaker 2:  the question for me always with Microsoft is how desperately is it going

1024
01:03:33,325 --> 01:03:37,125
Speaker 2:  to try to be consumer relevant? Because I think, and and

1025
01:03:37,125 --> 01:03:39,685
Speaker 2:  we've talked about this a lot, there is this thing where it's like, I, I

1026
01:03:39,685 --> 01:03:43,605
Speaker 2:  think if you think of Microsoft as like the leading B2B AI company

1027
01:03:44,155 --> 01:03:47,485
Speaker 2:  that feels totally plausible to me, right? That like it's, it's gonna, it's

1028
01:03:47,485 --> 01:03:50,445
Speaker 2:  gonna build the sort of enabling technology. It's gonna have the cloud infrastructure,

1029
01:03:50,475 --> 01:03:53,605
Speaker 2:  like that's where all the money is gonna be for the foreseeable future anyway.

1030
01:03:54,305 --> 01:03:58,245
Speaker 2:  But if, if Microsoft is happy being like the Microsoft of

1031
01:03:58,425 --> 01:04:02,365
Speaker 2:  AI then then you're fine. But Microsoft has

1032
01:04:02,365 --> 01:04:06,125
Speaker 2:  never been able to turn off this thing where It is desperate to be like mainstream

1033
01:04:06,485 --> 01:04:09,805
Speaker 2:  relevant to regular people outside of work in their day to day. And

1034
01:04:10,885 --> 01:04:14,005
Speaker 2:  I feel so much of that tension in copilot where Microsoft is like, we, we

1035
01:04:14,005 --> 01:04:16,645
Speaker 2:  want you to use this at work and we know you will and we know how to do that

1036
01:04:16,845 --> 01:04:20,805
Speaker 2:  'cause that is like Microsoft's core competency. But also when you go home,

1037
01:04:20,825 --> 01:04:23,565
Speaker 2:  we want it to be your best friend and we want you to hang out with your family

1038
01:04:24,365 --> 01:04:27,325
Speaker 2:  like in teams. Like I just, people will not use teams in their day-to-day

1039
01:04:27,325 --> 01:04:28,765
Speaker 2:  life. I just don't believe it. Yeah,

1040
01:04:29,085 --> 01:04:29,365
Speaker 11:  Absolutely not.

1041
01:04:29,845 --> 01:04:33,485
Speaker 2:  I hope that I'm wrong. I guess if you do it with your family, I'd love to

1042
01:04:33,485 --> 01:04:36,725
Speaker 2:  hear from you. But like, and that's fine if you're Microsoft, but like, it,

1043
01:04:36,725 --> 01:04:40,125
Speaker 2:  it just can't help itself in some ways and I'm so curious to see where it

1044
01:04:40,125 --> 01:04:40,365
Speaker 2:  lands.

1045
01:04:41,035 --> 01:04:44,045
Speaker 11:  Yeah, it's interesting you mentioned that because that's another part of

1046
01:04:44,045 --> 01:04:47,125
Speaker 11:  the vibe that we didn't really touch on that was kind of the vibe of the

1047
01:04:47,245 --> 01:04:51,205
Speaker 11:  event was there was like a very influencer, you know, that sort of

1048
01:04:51,205 --> 01:04:55,125
Speaker 11:  vibe. They, they invited a bunch of people that I've never seen

1049
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:58,765
Speaker 11:  at Microsoft event before. So, you know, doing like

1050
01:04:58,765 --> 01:05:02,645
Speaker 11:  selfies of everything and it was very much that it did feel like

1051
01:05:02,645 --> 01:05:05,845
Speaker 11:  that for the whole day. It felt like a party influencer vibe

1052
01:05:07,065 --> 01:05:10,685
Speaker 11:  and YouTubers and there's some, there's some folks there that, that have

1053
01:05:10,685 --> 01:05:14,445
Speaker 11:  covered Microsoft a bunch. Like I Justine and Austin Evans and yeah,

1054
01:05:14,445 --> 01:05:17,885
Speaker 11:  there's some of the big names but there was just a bunch of influencers

1055
01:05:17,945 --> 01:05:20,365
Speaker 11:  and like lifestyle influencers, you know,

1056
01:05:20,385 --> 01:05:21,325
Speaker 2:  That's really interesting.

1057
01:05:21,625 --> 01:05:25,485
Speaker 11:  It was an interesting, it felt like everything I've been seeing

1058
01:05:25,675 --> 01:05:29,485
Speaker 11:  kind of where Microsoft are going where they want people to focus on copilot

1059
01:05:30,225 --> 01:05:33,925
Speaker 11:  in, in an event. So it was definitely an interesting sort of sub vibe

1060
01:05:34,105 --> 01:05:37,765
Speaker 11:  to the things. Yeah. Do you affiliate it with co-pilot where you mentioned

1061
01:05:37,765 --> 01:05:41,285
Speaker 11:  that you, they want it at work and at home. The co-pilot at home is is like

1062
01:05:41,305 --> 01:05:44,165
Speaker 11:  so different to the work one, right? Like the work one is just doesn't have

1063
01:05:44,165 --> 01:05:47,285
Speaker 11:  the same UI at all. So there's there's, there's tension there and I dunno

1064
01:05:47,285 --> 01:05:48,445
Speaker 11:  how they're gonna resolve that. So

1065
01:05:48,515 --> 01:05:51,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah, and I feel like I get the work one, right? Like I I I can sort of see

1066
01:05:51,925 --> 01:05:55,605
Speaker 2:  where that's going. It makes sense to me and like obviously there, there

1067
01:05:55,605 --> 01:05:59,325
Speaker 2:  is such a super high ceiling if you can build the consumer one, but

1068
01:05:59,465 --> 01:06:03,085
Speaker 2:  the, the path to get there and even what that looks like is just

1069
01:06:03,145 --> 01:06:07,085
Speaker 2:  vastly less clear to me. But It is, It is like the shiny object to everybody

1070
01:06:07,085 --> 01:06:10,725
Speaker 2:  definitely even OpenAI, which could just like happily sell subscriptions

1071
01:06:10,725 --> 01:06:13,405
Speaker 2:  to developers forever and make all of its money. It is like how do we make

1072
01:06:13,405 --> 01:06:17,125
Speaker 2:  Chad GPT yell at you so that it's more fun to use. Like this is, I don't

1073
01:06:17,125 --> 01:06:19,805
Speaker 2:  know what, I don't know what problem we're gonna solve there, but everybody

1074
01:06:19,825 --> 01:06:21,205
Speaker 2:  is desperately trying to figure it out.

1075
01:06:21,205 --> 01:06:23,565
Speaker 11:  They're all trying to do it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's gonna, it's gonna

1076
01:06:23,565 --> 01:06:23,965
Speaker 11:  be interesting.

1077
01:06:24,405 --> 01:06:26,805
Speaker 2:  Alright, I'm gonna let you go here, but tell me about the 50th anniversary

1078
01:06:26,805 --> 01:06:27,965
Speaker 2:  surface and then I'm gonna let you go.

1079
01:06:28,545 --> 01:06:32,445
Speaker 11:  Oh yeah, so they've done a 50th anniversary surface. It's not too crazy

1080
01:06:32,445 --> 01:06:36,165
Speaker 11:  different. It is basically got a golden accent on the, on the logo

1081
01:06:36,345 --> 01:06:39,925
Speaker 11:  at the back and then it's got the, you know, 1975 disco

1082
01:06:41,015 --> 01:06:44,805
Speaker 11:  balls stuff on the, on the etch on the palm rest. Oh, that's cool. The old

1083
01:06:44,805 --> 01:06:48,725
Speaker 11:  like retro logo, so that's cool. But they're not selling it so you'll have

1084
01:06:48,725 --> 01:06:51,645
Speaker 11:  to win one or I think they're probably gonna sell them to employees as well,

1085
01:06:51,825 --> 01:06:52,045
Speaker 11:  so.

1086
01:06:52,505 --> 01:06:56,045
Speaker 2:  All right, well if you have one and wanna sell it to us, I have, I got 50

1087
01:06:56,045 --> 01:06:59,885
Speaker 2:  bucks with your name on it, so send us an email and also we, we

1088
01:06:59,885 --> 01:07:03,285
Speaker 2:  think are, we are, we're getting surfaces this year hopefully, right? Are

1089
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:07,125
Speaker 2:  we, are we due for surfaces? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Build is what, in six

1090
01:07:07,335 --> 01:07:07,685
Speaker 2:  weeks?

1091
01:07:09,385 --> 01:07:11,725
Speaker 11:  Yes. I might be back out to Seattle again. I

1092
01:07:11,725 --> 01:07:12,165
Speaker 2:  Think you might

1093
01:07:12,165 --> 01:07:13,725
Speaker 11:  Be, we could be speaking like this again.

1094
01:07:14,355 --> 01:07:18,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah. All right. Well for now Tom, thank you as always.

1095
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:19,685
Speaker 2:  Good to see you go get some sleep. Thank

1096
01:07:19,685 --> 01:07:19,805
Speaker 11:  You.

1097
01:07:20,985 --> 01:07:23,205
Speaker 2:  All right, we gotta take one more break and then we're gonna get to a question

1098
01:07:23,235 --> 01:07:25,125
Speaker 2:  from The Vergecast hotline. Be right back.

1099
01:09:04,045 --> 01:09:06,905
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Let's do a question from The Vergecast hotline. As

1100
01:09:06,905 --> 01:09:10,465
Speaker 2:  always, the number is 8 6 6 VERGE one one. The email is

1101
01:09:10,625 --> 01:09:13,585
Speaker 2:  vergecast at The Verge dot com. Thank you by the way, to everybody who reached

1102
01:09:13,605 --> 01:09:16,545
Speaker 2:  out with thoughts about minimalist phones doing that exercise with Allison

1103
01:09:16,655 --> 01:09:20,505
Speaker 2:  Last week was so much fun and you all had so many good, smart thoughts about

1104
01:09:20,505 --> 01:09:23,465
Speaker 2:  it that I think I'm actually gonna compile a bunch of them and throw them

1105
01:09:23,465 --> 01:09:26,425
Speaker 2:  all at Allison again and we're just gonna have to rerun that whole thing

1106
01:09:26,565 --> 01:09:30,385
Speaker 2:  in a couple of weeks. So stay tuned for that. For now, we have a

1107
01:09:30,505 --> 01:09:34,185
Speaker 2:  question from our email from Katie. Lemme read it to you. Katie writes,

1108
01:09:34,725 --> 01:09:37,665
Speaker 2:  I'm sure I won't be the only person asking this question true. By the way,

1109
01:09:37,665 --> 01:09:40,505
Speaker 2:  we got this question a bunch of times. This is very much a thing on people's

1110
01:09:40,505 --> 01:09:43,705
Speaker 2:  minds. The tariffs are projected to hit the car and tech industries the hardest

1111
01:09:43,965 --> 01:09:46,545
Speaker 2:  in thinking about preparing for this. I'm wondering if I should invest in

1112
01:09:46,545 --> 01:09:50,105
Speaker 2:  a new phone now rather than waiting till mine reaches obsolescence

1113
01:09:50,105 --> 01:09:53,505
Speaker 2:  potentially in a time when phones become much more expensive. To give you

1114
01:09:53,505 --> 01:09:56,705
Speaker 2:  an idea of the consumer, I tend to be, I currently have a pixel six, which

1115
01:09:56,705 --> 01:09:59,665
Speaker 2:  is working just fine. I'm not a person who is looking for the highest end

1116
01:09:59,665 --> 01:10:03,305
Speaker 2:  product or who upgrades unless my phone ceases to function. I'm very conscious

1117
01:10:03,305 --> 01:10:06,465
Speaker 2:  of the environmental impacts of the industries associated with the materials

1118
01:10:06,465 --> 01:10:10,305
Speaker 2:  and phones. I just don't wanna find myself in a bind in a year or two if

1119
01:10:10,305 --> 01:10:14,105
Speaker 2:  things keep going the way it looks like they're going. Thanks. This is,

1120
01:10:14,135 --> 01:10:17,305
Speaker 2:  this is the question right now and, and I think I I will say two things.

1121
01:10:18,645 --> 01:10:22,145
Speaker 2:  The two things that I should say right at the very top are that a,

1122
01:10:22,765 --> 01:10:26,425
Speaker 2:  who knows if any of this is real, right? The, the Trump administration's

1123
01:10:26,425 --> 01:10:30,385
Speaker 2:  tariff policy has been on and off and on and off and on and off that if you

1124
01:10:30,385 --> 01:10:34,305
Speaker 2:  were to ask me to bet whether these were going to stay

1125
01:10:34,365 --> 01:10:37,745
Speaker 2:  in effect the way that they are forever, I would say I absolutely have no

1126
01:10:37,745 --> 01:10:41,545
Speaker 2:  idea. I think what we've learned from the Trump administration, even just

1127
01:10:41,545 --> 01:10:44,825
Speaker 2:  over the last several days is that they are, they're very serious about these.

1128
01:10:44,825 --> 01:10:48,705
Speaker 2:  Donald Trump loves tariffs as a, as a weapon. He also loves them

1129
01:10:48,705 --> 01:10:52,625
Speaker 2:  as a negotiating tactic. And if this is just a way to force all of these

1130
01:10:52,905 --> 01:10:56,465
Speaker 2:  companies and all of these leaders and all of these politicians to come see

1131
01:10:56,485 --> 01:11:00,225
Speaker 2:  him and, you know, bend the knee and make a deal so that there's no more

1132
01:11:00,225 --> 01:11:04,185
Speaker 2:  tariffs, maybe that's where this lands. It'll be really messy in the interim,

1133
01:11:04,205 --> 01:11:08,065
Speaker 2:  but maybe fast forward three months from now, and most of

1134
01:11:08,065 --> 01:11:10,785
Speaker 2:  this is back to the way that it was with just a lot of chaos in between.

1135
01:11:10,935 --> 01:11:14,915
Speaker 2:  There's, there's a lot of precedent for that arc in the Trump administration,

1136
01:11:15,175 --> 01:11:18,995
Speaker 2:  but that is one possible outcome. Trump has also continued to say that he

1137
01:11:18,995 --> 01:11:22,675
Speaker 2:  believes in tariffs like he has said it all along. He said it in his campaign,

1138
01:11:22,675 --> 01:11:26,475
Speaker 2:  he has said it as president, like he, he believes tariffs are

1139
01:11:26,475 --> 01:11:29,755
Speaker 2:  good and that they work. And so I wouldn't rule out any

1140
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:33,715
Speaker 2:  possibility here. And so all we can do is I think operate with the

1141
01:11:33,715 --> 01:11:36,955
Speaker 2:  facts on the ground right now and the facts on the ground right now suggest

1142
01:11:37,705 --> 01:11:40,995
Speaker 2:  that things are about to get a lot more expensive. And I think a bunch of

1143
01:11:40,995 --> 01:11:44,595
Speaker 2:  folks on our team, particularly Alison Johnson on our team, who has been

1144
01:11:44,595 --> 01:11:47,395
Speaker 2:  doing a lot of really great work reporting on phone tariffs in particular,

1145
01:11:48,935 --> 01:11:52,075
Speaker 2:  the general consensus seems to be that the phones

1146
01:11:52,645 --> 01:11:56,595
Speaker 2:  today are not likely to get vastly more expensive for a bunch of

1147
01:11:56,595 --> 01:11:59,955
Speaker 2:  reasons, right? Like if you're, if you're Best Buy, you have a bunch of inventory,

1148
01:12:00,225 --> 01:12:04,155
Speaker 2:  it's also just really hard to like raise the price on an existing

1149
01:12:04,495 --> 01:12:08,435
Speaker 2:  device. What is much more likely in many of these cases is

1150
01:12:08,435 --> 01:12:12,115
Speaker 2:  that the next round of these phones is going to be more expensive. So we

1151
01:12:12,115 --> 01:12:15,595
Speaker 2:  have the, the iPhone 17 coming in the fall. We have the Pixel 10 coming

1152
01:12:16,075 --> 01:12:19,675
Speaker 2:  probably in the fall. We have new Samsung stuff coming this summer. There's

1153
01:12:19,675 --> 01:12:23,475
Speaker 2:  just a round of new phones due in a few months. And I think there is a

1154
01:12:23,475 --> 01:12:27,155
Speaker 2:  strong chance those phones will be substantially more

1155
01:12:27,155 --> 01:12:30,235
Speaker 2:  expensive. So I think it, frankly, if you're the person who is like happy

1156
01:12:30,235 --> 01:12:34,115
Speaker 2:  to be a few generations behind, it doesn't strike me as totally

1157
01:12:35,025 --> 01:12:38,915
Speaker 2:  wrongheaded to buy this year's phone on the bet that

1158
01:12:38,915 --> 01:12:41,515
Speaker 2:  next year's phone, even if it's better, is also likely to be significantly

1159
01:12:41,515 --> 01:12:45,155
Speaker 2:  more expensive. That goes against my normal buying advice, which is like,

1160
01:12:45,495 --> 01:12:49,355
Speaker 2:  buy the best device that you can and then keep it forever if there is a

1161
01:12:49,355 --> 01:12:52,875
Speaker 2:  chance that the next iPhone is going to be several hundred dollars more expensive,

1162
01:12:52,875 --> 01:12:55,555
Speaker 2:  which again, I, I wouldn't bet on it, but I also wouldn't bet against it.

1163
01:12:56,115 --> 01:13:00,075
Speaker 2:  I can see why you, you might look at a 16 and be like, okay, price to value,

1164
01:13:00,225 --> 01:13:03,475
Speaker 2:  this might be the best phone we're gonna get for a minute here. And

1165
01:13:04,065 --> 01:13:07,835
Speaker 2:  that is a, a reason to do it. If you're on a Pixel six, I think you're,

1166
01:13:07,835 --> 01:13:11,355
Speaker 2:  you're probably good for another year or two if you're happy with your phone.

1167
01:13:11,415 --> 01:13:14,995
Speaker 2:  Now there's also ways you can upgrade you. You can replace the battery, you

1168
01:13:14,995 --> 01:13:18,835
Speaker 2:  can replace the screen by itself. Like you, you can make devices last longer.

1169
01:13:19,095 --> 01:13:21,395
Speaker 2:  And that's my other piece of advice for anybody who's trying to think about

1170
01:13:21,895 --> 01:13:25,635
Speaker 2:  how do I make sense of like my gadget options here.

1171
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:30,155
Speaker 2:  I would say frankly buy the stuff that you know you're

1172
01:13:30,155 --> 01:13:33,915
Speaker 2:  gonna need quickly because I think it's possible we're gonna run

1173
01:13:33,915 --> 01:13:37,875
Speaker 2:  into supply constraints as companies scramble to figure this stuff out. It's

1174
01:13:38,115 --> 01:13:41,675
Speaker 2:  possible that the, the makeup of some of these devices is gonna change as

1175
01:13:41,675 --> 01:13:45,515
Speaker 2:  things like costs change. And as supply chains change, the, the

1176
01:13:45,535 --> 01:13:49,435
Speaker 2:  gadget you want may not be the same gadget for forever.

1177
01:13:49,975 --> 01:13:53,355
Speaker 2:  Prices might go up. So I think there, there is a real impetus to say, okay,

1178
01:13:53,355 --> 01:13:56,155
Speaker 2:  if I have a thing that works, how do I make it work longer? Like, I'll just

1179
01:13:56,155 --> 01:13:59,515
Speaker 2:  give you an example. I have these Bose quiet comfort headphones

1180
01:14:00,015 --> 01:14:03,875
Speaker 2:  and they're like, they're fine, but the, the ear cups on them

1181
01:14:04,665 --> 01:14:07,285
Speaker 2:  are just starting to wear, right? And so I've been sitting around being like,

1182
01:14:07,285 --> 01:14:11,045
Speaker 2:  okay, do I just upgrade? I think it's these, these are a bunch of

1183
01:14:11,125 --> 01:14:15,085
Speaker 2:  years old now. They're still fine, but I would like a better pair of

1184
01:14:15,085 --> 01:14:18,125
Speaker 2:  headphones. And so I'm like, okay, maybe, maybe these wearing out is a good

1185
01:14:18,125 --> 01:14:21,925
Speaker 2:  excuse to just go out and upgrade anyway. Now my answer is I'm gonna buy

1186
01:14:21,925 --> 01:14:25,565
Speaker 2:  new ear cups and I'm just going to keep using these headphones for as long

1187
01:14:25,565 --> 01:14:28,605
Speaker 2:  as I can. And I'm, that's just is what it's gonna be.

1188
01:14:29,485 --> 01:14:32,525
Speaker 2:  Headphones are expensive, they are potentially going to get more expensive

1189
01:14:32,545 --> 01:14:36,165
Speaker 2:  and I just, I'm gonna choose not to worry about that and put off that purchase

1190
01:14:36,545 --> 01:14:40,245
Speaker 2:  for as long as I can. So I think where I've landed personally amidst all

1191
01:14:40,245 --> 01:14:43,885
Speaker 2:  this chaos, all the advice I can give you is where I've landed is the things

1192
01:14:44,005 --> 01:14:47,645
Speaker 2:  I know I'm gonna need to do soon. I'm gonna do now. And

1193
01:14:48,005 --> 01:14:51,005
Speaker 2:  anything I can put off, I'm going to try and take steps to put off as long

1194
01:14:51,005 --> 01:14:54,885
Speaker 2:  as possible because it does feel like wherever we're headed is

1195
01:14:54,885 --> 01:14:58,445
Speaker 2:  gonna be messy, right? Like, I'm gonna try and make as few 20, 25

1196
01:14:58,765 --> 01:15:02,645
Speaker 2:  purchases as I can and I'm gonna try and make them all right. Now,

1197
01:15:03,805 --> 01:15:06,565
Speaker 2:  I don't know if that's the perfect strategy. I, I don't know if we're gonna

1198
01:15:06,565 --> 01:15:09,885
Speaker 2:  end up in like a, do you remember that early phase of the pandemic where

1199
01:15:09,885 --> 01:15:13,765
Speaker 2:  people were like, ho hoarding toilet paper? I don't know that a

1200
01:15:13,765 --> 01:15:17,405
Speaker 2:  run on that kind of thing in the gadget world is the right thing, but I do

1201
01:15:17,405 --> 01:15:21,205
Speaker 2:  know that It is a time of incredible uncertainty and it does feel

1202
01:15:21,205 --> 01:15:25,125
Speaker 2:  like things could go sideways. So I would look at it and say, okay, do

1203
01:15:25,285 --> 01:15:27,925
Speaker 2:  I think I'm gonna need a new phone in the next six months? And if the answer

1204
01:15:27,925 --> 01:15:31,565
Speaker 2:  is yes, I think just buy it now. There's not a great reason not to anyway.

1205
01:15:31,625 --> 01:15:34,365
Speaker 2:  The, the Pixel nine's a great phone. There's a bunch of good stuff out there.

1206
01:15:34,685 --> 01:15:37,125
Speaker 2:  I think there's a strong chance that whatever comes next is gonna be a lot

1207
01:15:37,125 --> 01:15:40,765
Speaker 2:  more expensive. I just go for it. I bought my wife a, a Pixel eight. She

1208
01:15:40,765 --> 01:15:44,605
Speaker 2:  likes it a lot. Great price, no notes. Very happy to have

1209
01:15:44,605 --> 01:15:48,525
Speaker 2:  solved that before we get outta here anyway, I would also

1210
01:15:48,525 --> 01:15:51,565
Speaker 2:  love to know what you think about this. By the way, if you have thoughts

1211
01:15:51,565 --> 01:15:55,285
Speaker 2:  or have made purchases or put off purchases or thinking about how to manage

1212
01:15:55,285 --> 01:15:58,965
Speaker 2:  this stuff, I'd love to hear from you. Vergecast to the virgin.com 8, 6, 6

1213
01:15:58,965 --> 01:16:02,925
Speaker 2:  Virgin one, one is the hotline. This is like a complicated

1214
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:06,205
Speaker 2:  question and it's a very VERGE question. We like talking about what you should

1215
01:16:06,205 --> 01:16:10,125
Speaker 2:  buy and when and for how much. And I think this is a wrinkle we have

1216
01:16:10,125 --> 01:16:13,805
Speaker 2:  not dealt with many times in, in the course of being on The Verge is

1217
01:16:14,265 --> 01:16:18,085
Speaker 2:  how is global politics going to change the price of your phone? It

1218
01:16:18,085 --> 01:16:21,645
Speaker 2:  always does, but it does much more directly now than I think most of us have

1219
01:16:21,765 --> 01:16:25,605
Speaker 2:  realized in the past. Alright, that's it for The Vergecast today. Thank you
