00:00:02,555 --> 00:00:06,325
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Tandem Mo Lead. I'm your

3
00:00:06,325 --> 00:00:10,085
Speaker 2:  friend David Pierce, and I am outdoors at a coffee shop

4
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:14,365
Speaker 2:  testing iPads. I try when I review devices to use them the

5
00:00:14,365 --> 00:00:17,605
Speaker 2:  way that people use them. So that means like trying to do work, playing

6
00:00:18,175 --> 00:00:21,165
Speaker 2:  games using the pencil, even though I'm a terrible artist. But I feel like

7
00:00:21,165 --> 00:00:24,285
Speaker 2:  for me, when I think about the iPad, the single most like

8
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,925
Speaker 2:  charming, romantic iPad use case you hear for the iPad

9
00:00:29,025 --> 00:00:32,485
Speaker 2:  is the people who just bring their iPad to a coffee shop, get a cup of

10
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:35,925
Speaker 2:  coffee, sit and do the Sunday crossword. I love it. That's what iPads are

11
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:40,045
Speaker 2:  for. So I am here, I have coffee, I have the iPad Pro, I have

12
00:00:40,075 --> 00:00:43,645
Speaker 2:  the iPad Air, and I have a ham and cheese croissant and I'm gonna do the

13
00:00:43,205 --> 00:00:46,485
Speaker 2:  crossword. I have a Monday crossword on the iPad Pro. I have a Sunday crossword

14
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:49,805
Speaker 2:  on the iPad air. I'm worried that I'm gonna kill the battery on the air before

15
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:52,605
Speaker 2:  I finish the crossword, not because the air's battery life is bad, but because

16
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:55,965
Speaker 2:  I'm very bad at Sunday crosswords, it's gonna be something. But anyway, we

17
00:00:55,965 --> 00:00:59,285
Speaker 2:  have a lot coming up on the show today we're gonna talk to Chris Welch about

18
00:00:59,565 --> 00:01:02,645
Speaker 2:  ole screens on the iPads. We're gonna talk about Sonos because there's a

19
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:05,205
Speaker 2:  lot of stuff going on with Sonos. We just have a lot to catch up on with

20
00:01:05,205 --> 00:01:08,045
Speaker 2:  Chris. So we're gonna do that. We're also gonna talk about Right to Repair

21
00:01:08,155 --> 00:01:11,245
Speaker 2:  Will Poor our producer, as you've heard a few times on this show, has been

22
00:01:11,315 --> 00:01:14,645
Speaker 2:  deep in the right to repair world over the last few months. And this time

23
00:01:14,645 --> 00:01:18,165
Speaker 2:  he has a really fun different kind of update on what it means

24
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:22,445
Speaker 2:  for us, the device owners and users when we can actually have

25
00:01:22,445 --> 00:01:26,045
Speaker 2:  them repaired in new ways. Super fun story. Then we're gonna get to the hotline.

26
00:01:26,195 --> 00:01:29,685
Speaker 2:  Like I said, lots to do in this episode. All that is coming up in just a

27
00:01:29,685 --> 00:01:33,525
Speaker 2:  second. But seriously, I have a lot of cross wording to do and I only have

28
00:01:33,645 --> 00:01:37,005
Speaker 2:  this one cup of coffee and not one croissant. So it's possible

29
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:41,125
Speaker 2:  it's not gonna happen, but I'm going for it. Wish me luck. This is The Vergecast.

30
00:01:41,305 --> 00:01:41,885
Speaker 2:  See you in a sec.

31
00:02:49,725 --> 00:02:53,535
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. All right, I crushed the Monday crossword,

32
00:02:53,645 --> 00:02:57,055
Speaker 2:  just crushed it top to bottom like eight minutes. Nailed it. Everything was

33
00:02:57,055 --> 00:03:00,885
Speaker 2:  great. And then I did so badly on the Sunday crossword that I gave up.

34
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:04,925
Speaker 2:  Almost immediately, my mom can just sort of sit down with a pen and

35
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:07,605
Speaker 2:  do the Sunday crossword. And I think it's remarkable. It's like watching

36
00:03:07,805 --> 00:03:11,325
Speaker 2:  somebody who's really good at Excel or PowerPoint or something, just sort

37
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:14,285
Speaker 2:  of use their tool. Like somebody who knows all the keyboard shortcuts for

38
00:03:14,285 --> 00:03:18,125
Speaker 2:  Photoshop. I am not one of those people. I found a bunch of words I had never

39
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:21,165
Speaker 2:  heard before in the clues and was like, this isn't going to happen. So I

40
00:03:21,165 --> 00:03:24,165
Speaker 2:  gave up, I came home. Here we are, let's get into the show. I don't know

41
00:03:24,165 --> 00:03:27,765
Speaker 2:  If you noticed it yet, but it's kind of officially become gadget season

42
00:03:27,955 --> 00:03:31,285
Speaker 2:  over the last couple of weeks. We had a quiet couple of months there, but

43
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,965
Speaker 2:  now it's developer conference time. Graduations are happening. So there's

44
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:38,525
Speaker 2:  deals everywhere. Back to school starts shockingly soon.

45
00:03:38,675 --> 00:03:41,925
Speaker 2:  Everybody's got stuff they wanna sell you for Christmas that is somehow already

46
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:45,685
Speaker 2:  coming out, even though it's May, it's just gonna be a deluge

47
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:49,405
Speaker 2:  of gear for the next few months. And to be clear, that is awesome news.

48
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:53,405
Speaker 2:  But this week there are two particular gadgety topics that I'm especially

49
00:03:53,405 --> 00:03:57,085
Speaker 2:  interested in. I wanna talk OLED screens now that I've reviewed the new iPad

50
00:03:57,105 --> 00:04:00,925
Speaker 2:  Pro. And I wanna talk Sonos because a lot has been happening and

51
00:04:01,055 --> 00:04:04,285
Speaker 2:  Sonos world the last couple of weeks. Some of it exciting and some of it

52
00:04:04,475 --> 00:04:08,405
Speaker 2:  extremely not exciting. And there is no one better to talk about either of

53
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:12,325
Speaker 2:  those things with than the verges. Chris Welch. Hi Chris. Hello. We

54
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:15,405
Speaker 2:  haven't done this in a while. It's like, no, no. We have a lot to catch up

55
00:04:15,405 --> 00:04:18,405
Speaker 2:  on. We haven't subjected anybody to terrible microphones in a while.

56
00:04:18,985 --> 00:04:20,885
Speaker 5:  Oh yes, we're very overdue on that. Yeah, we

57
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:24,605
Speaker 2:  Are. We have a bunch to catch up on. Basically two big things I wanna talk

58
00:04:24,605 --> 00:04:26,845
Speaker 2:  about while we're here. I wanna talk a little about iPads and then I wanna

59
00:04:26,845 --> 00:04:29,925
Speaker 2:  talk a lot about Sonos. But let's start with the iPads and I wanna talk to

60
00:04:29,925 --> 00:04:33,365
Speaker 2:  you in particular because you were very intrigued from the beginning

61
00:04:33,915 --> 00:04:35,925
Speaker 2:  with the new iPad Pro. Tell me why.

62
00:04:36,445 --> 00:04:40,125
Speaker 5:  I just use the iPad Pro quite a lot, honestly, for work,

63
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:44,005
Speaker 5:  for photo retouching, for lots of stuff, there's no device quite like it

64
00:04:44,175 --> 00:04:47,285
Speaker 5:  among like all the gadgets that I have, say like the new 13 inch model has

65
00:04:47,285 --> 00:04:51,125
Speaker 5:  definitely caught my interest. It looks kind of samey, but

66
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,925
Speaker 5:  also much nicer at the same time, which I can appreciate.

67
00:04:53,985 --> 00:04:56,885
Speaker 2:  That's kind of the story of the iPad. Like exactly samey, but much nicer

68
00:04:56,905 --> 00:05:00,125
Speaker 2:  in a way I can appreciate is like a perfect summation of the whole review

69
00:05:00,205 --> 00:05:01,205
Speaker 2:  I wrote of the iPad Pro.

70
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:04,085
Speaker 5:  Hey, I mean you've held it, you've used it for a while now. What do you,

71
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:05,805
Speaker 5:  what are your, your thoughts? What's your takeaway?

72
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:09,925
Speaker 2:  I mean it's, it's exactly that at this point for me. Right? And I think part

73
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:13,245
Speaker 2:  of the reason I'm curious for your thoughts is I, you're more of an OLED

74
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:16,925
Speaker 2:  expert than I am, so I'm curious how you read it. But my takeaway so far

75
00:05:16,925 --> 00:05:20,645
Speaker 2:  has been that in a certain way, this is like the platonic ideal of an

76
00:05:20,675 --> 00:05:24,485
Speaker 2:  iPad. Like it's very powerful, it's very thin, it's very light. Like I

77
00:05:24,485 --> 00:05:28,405
Speaker 2:  don't know how you'd spec this thing better than it is currently specked.

78
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:32,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And yet I feel like that has increased my enjoyment of the iPad Pro

79
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:35,885
Speaker 2:  by like 1%. It's like the iPad's just really good and

80
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:39,405
Speaker 2:  it's been really good for a really long time. And now here we are. But you,

81
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:42,245
Speaker 2:  again, part of the reason I wanted to talk to you about this is when Apple

82
00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:46,245
Speaker 2:  talks about like who uses the iPad? They like literally describe Chris

83
00:05:46,295 --> 00:05:50,165
Speaker 2:  Welch, right? Yeah. Like do some work tasks, lot of photo retouching.

84
00:05:50,195 --> 00:05:53,845
Speaker 2:  It's, it's like, it's a great sort of creative canvas and I feel like you

85
00:05:53,905 --> 00:05:57,805
Speaker 2:  use it more fully than most people I know. Yeah. And

86
00:05:57,805 --> 00:06:01,085
Speaker 2:  this is again where the OLED comes in. Like for you as a photographer and

87
00:06:01,085 --> 00:06:04,685
Speaker 2:  person who spends a lot of time with photos, what does this new screen

88
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:05,405
Speaker 2:  do for you?

89
00:06:05,925 --> 00:06:08,925
Speaker 5:  I mean the brightness is pretty much the same as the prior one, but there's

90
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:11,605
Speaker 5:  no more blooming, which is nice. So you've got those, you know, perfect OLED

91
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:15,525
Speaker 5:  blacks and whatnot. I haven't seen it that much in person, but I'm,

92
00:06:15,705 --> 00:06:17,805
Speaker 5:  I'm certain there are gonna be like a bunch of people who like obsess over

93
00:06:17,805 --> 00:06:20,805
Speaker 5:  like, you know, like the uniformity of the screen. Like there are these forum

94
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:23,885
Speaker 5:  posts where people go into a dark room with their iPhone and like load up

95
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:27,805
Speaker 5:  like a gray screen and like see like how uniform it is. Like as one

96
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:31,605
Speaker 5:  side, like slightly warmer and like people like obsess over like the

97
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:35,765
Speaker 5:  smallest panel like issues. So that's gonna be like a whole new wave with

98
00:06:35,765 --> 00:06:38,285
Speaker 5:  this one I'm sure once they actually get out to customers yet

99
00:06:38,285 --> 00:06:40,365
Speaker 2:  There's just so much of it to look at now. Yeah.

100
00:06:40,665 --> 00:06:44,565
Speaker 5:  Two old panels that's kind of cool. But yeah, I, I don't get

101
00:06:44,565 --> 00:06:47,445
Speaker 5:  the whole fitness thing. Like I wish they had like just put more battery.

102
00:06:47,445 --> 00:06:50,725
Speaker 5:  They've, they've said 10 hours for years and years and years at this point.

103
00:06:50,725 --> 00:06:53,965
Speaker 5:  Like that's true like when you use it as an iPad, but like once you like

104
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:57,525
Speaker 5:  do like laptop, laptop tasks with it, you're not getting 10 hours anymore.

105
00:06:57,825 --> 00:07:01,605
Speaker 5:  So I wish they'd kept the same thickness as before but added more battery.

106
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:04,645
Speaker 5:  But we said that about their stuff all the time, so I know

107
00:07:05,035 --> 00:07:07,405
Speaker 2:  It's been true for so many years at this point. Yeah. And I actually think

108
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:11,405
Speaker 2:  I have found that argument somewhat compelling over the years because

109
00:07:11,925 --> 00:07:15,565
Speaker 2:  I think in most cases thinner, genuinely sort of is better in a lot of cases

110
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,645
Speaker 2:  and especially lighter is better for the iPad.

111
00:07:17,795 --> 00:07:19,325
Speaker 5:  It's lighter especially. Yeah. But

112
00:07:19,325 --> 00:07:22,805
Speaker 2:  I think at this point we might have tipped to, I would actually take slightly

113
00:07:22,805 --> 00:07:26,365
Speaker 2:  heavier. It's so light and so thin, like it feels

114
00:07:26,365 --> 00:07:30,325
Speaker 2:  amazing. Yeah. But then I pick up last year's pro and that

115
00:07:30,355 --> 00:07:33,965
Speaker 2:  also felt great. I still have zero complaints about it even compared to this

116
00:07:33,965 --> 00:07:37,525
Speaker 2:  new one. Yeah. So I'm like just if, if I were to hand back a little bit of

117
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:41,365
Speaker 2:  that thickness and weight and we can get rid of the camera bump and and

118
00:07:41,365 --> 00:07:45,285
Speaker 2:  more battery. Yeah. I think I'd make that trade I had. But yeah, we've been

119
00:07:45,285 --> 00:07:48,445
Speaker 2:  asking for that trade for years now. I don't think we're ever gonna get it.

120
00:07:48,655 --> 00:07:49,245
Speaker 5:  How's the keyboard?

121
00:07:49,585 --> 00:07:50,925
Speaker 2:  Oh dude, it's, it's so good.

122
00:07:50,925 --> 00:07:54,165
Speaker 5:  They got rid of my favorite smart keyboard folio. I know. So I'm very upset

123
00:07:54,165 --> 00:07:57,645
Speaker 5:  about that. I'm hoping it'll still work. Like I haven't tried it so maybe

124
00:07:57,645 --> 00:07:58,125
Speaker 5:  it'll still work.

125
00:07:58,565 --> 00:08:02,165
Speaker 2:  I have to confess, I have zero feelings about the smart keyboard folio. I

126
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:05,805
Speaker 2:  just, just none at all. Why? Why tell me all of your feelings.

127
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:06,405
Speaker 2:  Because it

128
00:08:06,405 --> 00:08:09,685
Speaker 5:  Was like a perfect on the go keyboard. It was lightweight, so lightweight

129
00:08:09,745 --> 00:08:13,165
Speaker 5:  and like the keyboard was like very mediocre. But like it was there when

130
00:08:13,165 --> 00:08:15,805
Speaker 5:  you needed it and when it wasn't, you would just like flip it behind and

131
00:08:15,805 --> 00:08:18,765
Speaker 5:  use the iPad for other stuff. Whereas with the magic keyboard, you're just

132
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,325
Speaker 5:  constantly like taking it off, putting it on, taking it off, putting it on.

133
00:08:21,475 --> 00:08:25,325
Speaker 5:  There's no natural like secondary mode. And so I wish there was like

134
00:08:25,445 --> 00:08:28,885
Speaker 5:  a, some kind of keyboard accessory that had that same kind of

135
00:08:29,765 --> 00:08:30,085
Speaker 5:  versatility.

136
00:08:30,355 --> 00:08:33,765
Speaker 2:  That is fair. I will give you that. The magic keyboard now, even though it's

137
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:37,525
Speaker 2:  lighter is still heavy. Yeah. And it like doubles the size of the iPad

138
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:41,125
Speaker 2:  essentially. And the thing I liked about the Folio, the folio was the one

139
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:44,965
Speaker 2:  you could actually pull the keyboard off and just have the case be a

140
00:08:44,965 --> 00:08:48,765
Speaker 2:  kickstand, right? No. Oh that wasn't that one. See there's so many accessories.

141
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,285
Speaker 2:  How am I supposed to keep all of these straight?

142
00:08:50,685 --> 00:08:52,805
Speaker 5:  But no, the Foley would just fold behind and so you'd like hold the iPad

143
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:55,290
Speaker 5:  and like the keys would be in your fingers, which was kind of strange. But

144
00:08:55,485 --> 00:08:58,765
Speaker 5:  you know, I got used to all of it. It was quirky, it was made terribly. Like

145
00:08:58,765 --> 00:09:01,525
Speaker 5:  that material they use, it just got awful. But like, you know, the keyboard

146
00:09:01,635 --> 00:09:05,405
Speaker 5:  felt so nice and it was like waterproof and had a lot of benefits.

147
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:08,925
Speaker 5:  I mean, you know, it's not as nice as the magic keyboard by any means. But

148
00:09:08,975 --> 00:09:12,605
Speaker 5:  $300 for a keyboard in any, any context as kind of silly.

149
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:13,005
Speaker 5:  Oh,

150
00:09:13,005 --> 00:09:16,925
Speaker 2:  It's, it's lunacy. I mean, and, and I continue to be in a, a

151
00:09:16,925 --> 00:09:20,805
Speaker 2:  hard position with all of this iPad stuff of like, if I recommend that

152
00:09:20,805 --> 00:09:24,565
Speaker 2:  you buy an iPad, I'm basically saying you should buy an iPad Pro

153
00:09:25,075 --> 00:09:28,925
Speaker 2:  plus a pencil Pro plus the new magic keyboard. And at this point I've just

154
00:09:28,925 --> 00:09:31,445
Speaker 2:  recommended like $1,800 worth of gadgets to you.

155
00:09:31,955 --> 00:09:33,125
Speaker 5:  What size iPad Pro

156
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:37,005
Speaker 2:  Though? I am personally forever a fan of the 11 inch, like the 13

157
00:09:37,055 --> 00:09:40,965
Speaker 2:  feels great this year. It's, it's much more wield able than

158
00:09:40,965 --> 00:09:44,285
Speaker 2:  it was. Yeah. But I still for my own uses

159
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:48,845
Speaker 2:  the 11 inches, it's the one, the keyword's a little smaller but I can hold

160
00:09:48,845 --> 00:09:52,485
Speaker 2:  the thing a lot better. It's a little, just more manageable

161
00:09:52,665 --> 00:09:56,045
Speaker 2:  for me personally. But I would imagine for you the 13 inch is is the only

162
00:09:56,065 --> 00:09:56,285
Speaker 2:  one.

163
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:59,165
Speaker 5:  Yeah, just that bigger canvas. Like I love those removes of like a 15 inch

164
00:09:59,315 --> 00:10:02,765
Speaker 5:  iPad and like a 16 inch iPad. Gimme that tomorrow. I'll absolutely get that.

165
00:10:03,545 --> 00:10:07,005
Speaker 5:  So yeah, just make it bigger and bigger and I'm, I'm here for it. But yeah

166
00:10:07,005 --> 00:10:09,445
Speaker 5:  I can see a case for the 11 especially now 'cause the screen is the same,

167
00:10:09,885 --> 00:10:12,405
Speaker 5:  the OLED on the 13 inch. So yeah

168
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:15,405
Speaker 2:  The the one last thing on the OLED and then let's switch and talk about Sonos.

169
00:10:15,435 --> 00:10:19,285
Speaker 2:  This whole tandem ole idea, you've been covering the TV world

170
00:10:19,305 --> 00:10:23,285
Speaker 2:  for forever. There's been this sort of march of ole in those devices forever

171
00:10:23,805 --> 00:10:27,485
Speaker 2:  ole in gigantic TVs. It's getting a little cheaper and a little better. Where

172
00:10:27,485 --> 00:10:31,005
Speaker 2:  does what Apple's doing fit into kind of the overall ole

173
00:10:31,605 --> 00:10:32,205
Speaker 2:  universe for you?

174
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:36,365
Speaker 5:  It seems pretty innovative. Like there aren't too many TVs that do that at

175
00:10:36,365 --> 00:10:40,045
Speaker 5:  all. So I think like their thinking is that like two OLEDs can get brighter

176
00:10:40,385 --> 00:10:43,765
Speaker 5:  and like stay safe longer. Whereas like If you push like a single ole panel

177
00:10:43,765 --> 00:10:47,605
Speaker 5:  that hard for years and years. It might not kind of age as well. So it seems

178
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,925
Speaker 5:  like a smart way of going about it. I haven't seen it in person. I'm sure

179
00:10:49,925 --> 00:10:52,725
Speaker 5:  people are gonna do like all, all sorts of like closeups and you know, like

180
00:10:52,725 --> 00:10:55,405
Speaker 5:  deep dives on the tech there. But it's pretty cool. You know, it's a very

181
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:58,005
Speaker 5:  aptly thing to kind of put that in the iPad. So

182
00:10:58,185 --> 00:11:01,085
Speaker 2:  Do you think if this is the sort of thing that works, we might start to see

183
00:11:01,085 --> 00:11:04,925
Speaker 2:  at other places like a tandem o led television, is that a thing that makes

184
00:11:04,945 --> 00:11:05,725
Speaker 2:  any sense over time?

185
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,325
Speaker 5:  I don't think it makes sense for the TVs 'cause they're already like pretty

186
00:11:08,325 --> 00:11:12,045
Speaker 5:  bright like past like 2000 hits these days so they don't really need that

187
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:15,525
Speaker 5:  up of laptops. Maybe I could see it being a thing certainly. So we'll see

188
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:18,285
Speaker 5:  how it goes and see if it has like burn or any kind of like negative effects

189
00:11:18,435 --> 00:11:21,605
Speaker 5:  over time. Yeah. But yeah for now it just looks very pretty so.

190
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:25,525
Speaker 2:  Okay. Yeah the, the timeline of all of this is gonna be interesting. Like

191
00:11:25,525 --> 00:11:29,445
Speaker 2:  I've, I've had the iPads for six days now and you can do a lot

192
00:11:29,445 --> 00:11:32,085
Speaker 2:  with an iPad in six days. Especially like we've used a lot of iPads for a

193
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:35,565
Speaker 2:  long time. But the two biggest questions I have are a, are there going to

194
00:11:35,565 --> 00:11:38,965
Speaker 2:  be burn in issues on this screen because it's OLED and Apple's theory about

195
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:42,925
Speaker 2:  why that might not happen tracks at least sort of philosophically but

196
00:11:42,925 --> 00:11:45,805
Speaker 2:  like we just don't know. And in six months it'll be really interesting to

197
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:49,685
Speaker 2:  see. And then the other one is, is literally just like breaking and bending.

198
00:11:49,685 --> 00:11:53,285
Speaker 2:  Like every single morning I take this thing out of my backpack

199
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,845
Speaker 2:  or my suitcase as it was over the weekend or just like pick it off off my

200
00:11:56,845 --> 00:12:00,005
Speaker 2:  desk and just look at it. I'm like, did it bend? Are we good? And so far

201
00:12:00,005 --> 00:12:03,925
Speaker 2:  it's fine. So far it's fine. But like am I gonna be shocked? I saw

202
00:12:03,925 --> 00:12:06,645
Speaker 5:  Some story that there's some kind of like new steel like rib inside there

203
00:12:06,645 --> 00:12:09,605
Speaker 5:  for like added strength. So it's got some kinda like new component in there

204
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:13,845
Speaker 5:  to keep it from bending ideally. That's awesome. 'cause we started that whole

205
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:17,685
Speaker 5:  like news cycle back in like 2018 when they were shipping bent outta the

206
00:12:17,685 --> 00:12:20,525
Speaker 5:  box, which was was pretty lousy.

207
00:12:20,945 --> 00:12:24,125
Speaker 2:  I'm sure there are those, those pictures of the bent ones still. Yeah like

208
00:12:24,175 --> 00:12:28,085
Speaker 2:  haunt the memories of people at Apple. It's good stuff. Yeah. Alright,

209
00:12:28,085 --> 00:12:30,925
Speaker 2:  let's talk Sonos for a little bit. 'cause Sonos has been, I would say largely

210
00:12:30,925 --> 00:12:34,565
Speaker 2:  because of you very in the news the last couple of weeks. Let, let's talk

211
00:12:34,565 --> 00:12:37,125
Speaker 2:  about new products and then I wanna talk about the app and the kerfuffle

212
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:37,765
Speaker 2:  around the app.

213
00:12:37,985 --> 00:12:38,605
Speaker 5:  Oh the app.

214
00:12:38,695 --> 00:12:42,165
Speaker 2:  We're gonna get to that. But the, the big new thing that you have revealed

215
00:12:42,305 --> 00:12:46,285
Speaker 2:  is coming and that has been kind of a semi-open secret for a while is coming

216
00:12:47,145 --> 00:12:51,005
Speaker 2:  is the, the long awaited Sonos headphones. Tell me about the headphones.

217
00:12:51,565 --> 00:12:55,365
Speaker 5:  They're called the Sonos Ace. There are photos on the site, they look very

218
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:58,925
Speaker 5:  nice. They seem pretty high-end. They're gonna cost around four

219
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:02,685
Speaker 5:  $50 I believe is the rumor. They're gonna have like noise cancellation,

220
00:13:02,705 --> 00:13:06,565
Speaker 5:  all the usual high-end headphones stuff. They're gonna do tie-ins to your

221
00:13:06,565 --> 00:13:10,045
Speaker 5:  home theater. So If, you own like a Sonos arc. You'll be able to hear TV

222
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:13,885
Speaker 5:  audio and do like spatial audio with head tracking for Atmos

223
00:13:13,885 --> 00:13:17,245
Speaker 5:  content. And so yeah, Sonos wants this to be their next big hit 'cause they

224
00:13:17,245 --> 00:13:20,565
Speaker 5:  kind of need a hit. They've had like a few soft quarters and people aren't

225
00:13:20,565 --> 00:13:24,165
Speaker 5:  buying their speakers as much as they were during Covid Lockdowns and all

226
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:27,285
Speaker 5:  that. So they really need some kind of pick me up and they're really hoping

227
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:28,805
Speaker 5:  that this is gonna be that.

228
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:32,885
Speaker 2:  So I can imagine a world in which Sonos

229
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:36,085
Speaker 2:  basically just says we're very good at making audio products,

230
00:13:36,655 --> 00:13:39,325
Speaker 2:  we've made home audio products, now we're making a different kind of audio

231
00:13:39,325 --> 00:13:43,285
Speaker 2:  product. Is there more to the advantage of buying headphones from

232
00:13:43,415 --> 00:13:47,325
Speaker 2:  Sonos other than just, they will probably be very good because Sonos is

233
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:51,285
Speaker 2:  making them. Like what, what in theory do you think people gain by buying

234
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:53,805
Speaker 2:  Sonos headphones as a Sonos thing?

235
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:56,365
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I think we'll see what they say once they actually like, you know,

236
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,805
Speaker 5:  actually announce them. But yeah, I think it's gonna be just a story of,

237
00:14:00,225 --> 00:14:03,685
Speaker 5:  you know, we built our brand on audio. We know audio, but it's hard to compete

238
00:14:03,685 --> 00:14:06,525
Speaker 5:  with like Bose in terms of like noise cancellations come out of the gate

239
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:10,205
Speaker 5:  and like challenge Bose in terms of a NC or Apple, you know, as the best

240
00:14:10,805 --> 00:14:14,605
Speaker 5:  transparency mode on the market and like B and it sounds like Sonos thinks

241
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:18,405
Speaker 5:  that like they have the best everything. So we'll see how that actually

242
00:14:18,405 --> 00:14:22,045
Speaker 5:  bears out in practice. But in terms of like what they'll offer some kind

243
00:14:22,045 --> 00:14:24,285
Speaker 5:  of time in with home theater, I don't think they're gonna play like wifi

244
00:14:24,775 --> 00:14:28,205
Speaker 5:  audio or anything like that. So it's gonna be somewhat limited

245
00:14:28,885 --> 00:14:32,445
Speaker 5:  the tie into the Sonos ecosystem but, we'll, we'll see. I don't know. They

246
00:14:32,445 --> 00:14:35,565
Speaker 5:  look cool and they had to put out this new app because of the headphones

247
00:14:35,705 --> 00:14:39,285
Speaker 5:  so that's why there was a rush to get the new app

248
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:43,525
Speaker 5:  out and the Sonos community has not received it that

249
00:14:43,545 --> 00:14:43,965
Speaker 5:  warmly.

250
00:14:43,965 --> 00:14:47,005
Speaker 2:  Alright fine. You wanna talk about the app? Let's talk about the app. It's

251
00:14:47,005 --> 00:14:50,485
Speaker 2:  fine. We waited long enough. Let's talk about the app. Yeah, so the story

252
00:14:50,485 --> 00:14:54,165
Speaker 2:  as I understand it and I confess I am a Sonos user to the extent that I have

253
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:58,245
Speaker 2:  Sonos speakers and I play them through the Spotify app.

254
00:14:58,385 --> 00:15:02,245
Speaker 2:  So I, I have almost no knowledge of the Sonos app except that it

255
00:15:02,245 --> 00:15:05,085
Speaker 2:  is the thing I use to set up my Sonos speakers and then essentially ignore

256
00:15:05,085 --> 00:15:08,685
Speaker 2:  because I just use Spotify, what has happened with this app? What is, what

257
00:15:08,685 --> 00:15:09,445
Speaker 2:  is going on here?

258
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:13,605
Speaker 5:  So they redesigned the whole thing to make it faster and easier to get to

259
00:15:13,605 --> 00:15:17,565
Speaker 5:  your speakers and just like change settings and search for music. So it's

260
00:15:17,565 --> 00:15:21,125
Speaker 5:  got a whole new coat of paint but they've taken out like many, many

261
00:15:21,445 --> 00:15:25,325
Speaker 5:  features like local music search is gone. You can't like edit

262
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:27,645
Speaker 5:  your queue like If, you make like a playlist. You can't do something that

263
00:15:27,925 --> 00:15:30,925
Speaker 5:  basic until June they're saying that'll come back. So people are gonna have

264
00:15:30,925 --> 00:15:32,325
Speaker 5:  to wait a month for some pretty basic,

265
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:37,245
Speaker 2:  The Q thing is is wild to me. Yeah, I think I, I wanna come back to the local

266
00:15:37,245 --> 00:15:40,405
Speaker 2:  music thing because I, I have both questions and a lot of thoughts about

267
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:43,725
Speaker 2:  that but, but I honestly feel like one of the

268
00:15:44,115 --> 00:15:47,925
Speaker 2:  core benefits of a Sonos system Yeah.

269
00:15:48,345 --> 00:15:51,765
Speaker 2:  Is the way the queue works. Yeah. And it's a thing people love. It's a thing

270
00:15:51,765 --> 00:15:55,565
Speaker 2:  they like to manage. It's a very good system and it is

271
00:15:55,685 --> 00:15:59,525
Speaker 2:  o of all possible features to leave out for Sonos, I would put

272
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:03,405
Speaker 2:  that like mere last on the list. It's so wild to

273
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:04,525
Speaker 2:  me that that wasn't here.

274
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:08,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah it's a music app. Yeah and they took that out. They stuff like

275
00:16:08,685 --> 00:16:12,485
Speaker 5:  sleep timers are gone until like May or June, late May or June. So it's just

276
00:16:12,815 --> 00:16:15,965
Speaker 5:  stuff that's been taken out just so this app could be more, you know, somewhat

277
00:16:15,965 --> 00:16:18,205
Speaker 5:  faster. I think Neli likes it quite a bit. So it depends like how you use

278
00:16:18,205 --> 00:16:21,125
Speaker 5:  your own set. Like some people don't have like, you know, local music to

279
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:24,445
Speaker 5:  deal with or some people just use airplay to play stuff when there's snow

280
00:16:24,495 --> 00:16:28,085
Speaker 5:  skier. So if they do that then I doubt they even care. But yeah, there are

281
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:30,765
Speaker 5:  a lot of like downgrades you could say like the accessibility has gotten

282
00:16:30,765 --> 00:16:34,205
Speaker 5:  worse, which is terrible for people who like need those features. So that'll

283
00:16:34,205 --> 00:16:36,845
Speaker 5:  be hopefully fixed by the end of this month. But stuff like that just has

284
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:40,445
Speaker 5:  people asking like, what the hell was the rush here? Like why didn't you

285
00:16:40,445 --> 00:16:43,605
Speaker 5:  put this out as like a beta option and like have the old app still there

286
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:47,165
Speaker 5:  alongside it, you know, which are fair questions honestly versus just like

287
00:16:47,165 --> 00:16:48,605
Speaker 5:  forcing everyone onto it right away.

288
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:52,525
Speaker 2:  Yeah. What is your sense of the backstory there? I think this does seem like

289
00:16:53,085 --> 00:16:56,925
Speaker 2:  a somewhat surprising kind of own goal from Sonos on this

290
00:16:56,925 --> 00:16:59,925
Speaker 2:  front. Like what, what, what is your sense of what's going on there? Yeah,

291
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:02,325
Speaker 5:  I think it's all about the headphones really. That was just kind of strange

292
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:04,525
Speaker 5:  that they're like putting all this like pressure on a product that no one

293
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:08,085
Speaker 5:  owns yet. And so they're like making life less convenient for people who

294
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:11,525
Speaker 5:  have bought their stuff and their speakers just in the name of these ace

295
00:17:11,525 --> 00:17:12,565
Speaker 5:  headphones once they're out.

296
00:17:12,745 --> 00:17:16,085
Speaker 2:  So why do the headphones require this new app? Like the last time they did

297
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:20,005
Speaker 2:  a big update like this, it was to yeah basically change the whole infrastructure

298
00:17:20,025 --> 00:17:22,965
Speaker 2:  of the system. Right. And that's, that's always gonna be challenging, right?

299
00:17:23,005 --> 00:17:26,125
Speaker 2:  I get that. That is a thing you eventually have to do. It's gonna be messy.

300
00:17:26,605 --> 00:17:29,325
Speaker 2:  I dunno that Sonos handled it perfectly but like I feel like that went fine.

301
00:17:29,325 --> 00:17:32,445
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And everybody hemmed and hawed and then kind of got on with their life.

302
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:36,925
Speaker 2:  This one seems like it just could have been

303
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:40,605
Speaker 2:  easier and Sonos kind of whiffed it. What is it about the

304
00:17:40,605 --> 00:17:42,005
Speaker 2:  headphones that is forcing all of this?

305
00:17:42,365 --> 00:17:45,045
Speaker 5:  I think they're trying to make it so you can like set them up easier out

306
00:17:45,045 --> 00:17:48,165
Speaker 5:  of the house. You know like most Sonos gear you have to like be be home on

307
00:17:48,165 --> 00:17:50,885
Speaker 5:  your wifi Sure. Before you set it up. Whereas like headphones you don't want

308
00:17:50,995 --> 00:17:53,725
Speaker 5:  have to deal with that. So I guess that was part of the stack that they had

309
00:17:53,725 --> 00:17:57,525
Speaker 5:  to change. But as far as like why a whole new app design was necessary or

310
00:17:57,525 --> 00:18:00,645
Speaker 5:  like if these things just kind of like happen to coincide at some point.

311
00:18:01,385 --> 00:18:04,365
Speaker 5:  But yeah, people are upset very, very mad If you go to the Sonos sub Reddit

312
00:18:04,365 --> 00:18:07,845
Speaker 5:  or their forums they're saying we're listening and like they're like talking

313
00:18:07,845 --> 00:18:10,245
Speaker 5:  to like their customers like on the forums and stuff and they're saying like

314
00:18:10,245 --> 00:18:12,285
Speaker 5:  this is when this feature will come back, this is when this feature will

315
00:18:12,285 --> 00:18:16,085
Speaker 5:  come back. But yeah, I don't know it just seems seems like a very big unforced

316
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:19,165
Speaker 5:  error that yeah. That they've made here and, and it's kind of shaken, you

317
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:21,805
Speaker 5:  know, trust in them again after the S one s two thing, which was overblown

318
00:18:21,805 --> 00:18:25,725
Speaker 5:  like you said, like they never like killed any products. They left some

319
00:18:25,725 --> 00:18:28,885
Speaker 5:  of their very oldest devices on the S one platform and like everything else

320
00:18:28,945 --> 00:18:32,445
Speaker 5:  is still supported on S two so that was kind of ugly. But they did it and

321
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:36,005
Speaker 5:  it was fine. This is just different, it's like a change for the sake of change

322
00:18:36,265 --> 00:18:39,845
Speaker 5:  and I think that's just not going over super well. But yeah, maybe the headphones

323
00:18:39,845 --> 00:18:43,165
Speaker 5:  will come out and like they'll be mind blowing and you know all will be forgiven.

324
00:18:43,395 --> 00:18:43,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

325
00:18:44,055 --> 00:18:46,845
Speaker 2:  We'll see, I mean I think part of the reason I'm so hung up on the local

326
00:18:46,855 --> 00:18:50,365
Speaker 2:  music side of this is that it feels like a microcosm of

327
00:18:50,575 --> 00:18:54,525
Speaker 2:  Sonos sort of losing its core audience, right? That like this

328
00:18:54,525 --> 00:18:58,205
Speaker 2:  company has been the company for people who are willing to spend

329
00:18:58,355 --> 00:18:58,645
Speaker 2:  some

330
00:18:58,645 --> 00:18:59,805
Speaker 5:  Of their oldest customers especially

331
00:18:59,915 --> 00:19:03,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And who are like willing to spend a lot of money to get really good

332
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:06,285
Speaker 2:  audio. There was just nothing like it for a really, really long time and

333
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:10,085
Speaker 2:  people spent a lot of money, they bought into these systems, they did a lot

334
00:19:10,085 --> 00:19:13,965
Speaker 2:  of work to maintain these systems and then it feels like sometimes for good

335
00:19:13,965 --> 00:19:17,045
Speaker 2:  reasons and sometimes for bad reasons and recently for very bad reasons,

336
00:19:17,895 --> 00:19:21,165
Speaker 2:  Sonos has just kind of blown all of that up and it feels like it, it's like

337
00:19:21,525 --> 00:19:24,845
Speaker 2:  when Apple forgets about the Mac Pro for like a decade at a time. It's just

338
00:19:24,845 --> 00:19:28,285
Speaker 2:  like all you have to do is just sort of keep reminding these people that

339
00:19:28,285 --> 00:19:31,205
Speaker 2:  you love them and all that means is just to keep supporting local music.

340
00:19:31,485 --> 00:19:34,645
Speaker 2:  Like just let people upload their MP threes to your thing and there is a

341
00:19:34,645 --> 00:19:36,285
Speaker 2:  set of people on earth who will love you forever.

342
00:19:36,785 --> 00:19:38,205
Speaker 5:  I'm one of those people. Yeah. You

343
00:19:38,205 --> 00:19:42,005
Speaker 2:  Know, and I can't tell if Sonos is like trying hard

344
00:19:42,145 --> 00:19:45,485
Speaker 2:  to push away from those people in the name of like finding a much bigger

345
00:19:45,805 --> 00:19:49,645
Speaker 2:  audience with things like headphones or if it's just screwing up

346
00:19:49,665 --> 00:19:53,245
Speaker 2:  unintentionally. But I, it's, it's just a really odd move to me

347
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:57,125
Speaker 2:  to look at the people who have had your stuff for damn near 20 years at this

348
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,885
Speaker 2:  point and are like the people who care the most about their music. Yeah.

349
00:20:01,225 --> 00:20:05,085
Speaker 2:  And just say, oh we redesigned an app and we have nothing for you. That

350
00:20:05,085 --> 00:20:05,965
Speaker 2:  seems nuts to me.

351
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:08,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I don't think it was intentional. I think it was just like they had

352
00:20:08,245 --> 00:20:11,485
Speaker 5:  their, they just like really mixed up their priorities as they were building

353
00:20:11,485 --> 00:20:14,005
Speaker 5:  this app and now they're hearing about it. Obviously there are good parts

354
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:17,365
Speaker 5:  to this app, like don't get me wrong. So there's a web app now, which is

355
00:20:17,485 --> 00:20:20,845
Speaker 5:  very cool. You can like access your system from like anywhere. And so that

356
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:23,365
Speaker 5:  wasn't a thing before so that's great. There are other odds and ends like

357
00:20:23,365 --> 00:20:26,485
Speaker 5:  it's faster to like move around your system like access your speakers and

358
00:20:26,775 --> 00:20:30,685
Speaker 5:  stuff like that. But it's just like lots of change all at once And

359
00:20:30,725 --> 00:20:33,605
Speaker 5:  I think like people are fair when they say like you should have just done

360
00:20:33,645 --> 00:20:37,285
Speaker 5:  a beta or had them, you know, side by side or you know, like a preview

361
00:20:37,785 --> 00:20:41,685
Speaker 5:  app for a while just to kind of like ease people in versus like just

362
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:45,325
Speaker 5:  here's the new app, half the stuff is missing and it'll be back in like two

363
00:20:45,325 --> 00:20:49,285
Speaker 5:  months. So you know, that's never gonna go over well and it hasn't but

364
00:20:49,645 --> 00:20:53,445
Speaker 5:  I think they're learning again their second painful lesson after the S one

365
00:20:53,445 --> 00:20:56,125
Speaker 5:  and S two fiasco and now we're here, so Yeah.

366
00:20:56,395 --> 00:20:56,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

367
00:20:56,685 --> 00:21:00,045
Speaker 5:  Let's hope we'll see where things wind up in like late June. Hopefully it'll

368
00:21:00,045 --> 00:21:01,645
Speaker 5:  be at parody with the old app again. Yeah,

369
00:21:01,685 --> 00:21:04,965
Speaker 2:  I mean again I, it's, it's just been, I think I'm really sensitive to it

370
00:21:05,245 --> 00:21:08,885
Speaker 2:  right now because we had Humane and Rabbit both

371
00:21:08,895 --> 00:21:12,085
Speaker 2:  being like, oh don't worry, our products are awful now but they're gonna

372
00:21:12,085 --> 00:21:15,325
Speaker 2:  be so good this summer. And then it was like for Sonos to basically come

373
00:21:15,325 --> 00:21:18,285
Speaker 2:  out and say exactly the same thing, it's just like, oh no, like I've heard

374
00:21:18,285 --> 00:21:21,965
Speaker 2:  this too many times now. Yeah I just don't believe you. And also

375
00:21:22,065 --> 00:21:25,365
Speaker 2:  if that's true, why did you ship it now? Like just,

376
00:21:25,915 --> 00:21:26,205
Speaker 5:  Just

377
00:21:26,835 --> 00:21:28,925
Speaker 2:  Support everything for two months. It'll be fine.

378
00:21:29,115 --> 00:21:30,285
Speaker 5:  Exactly. Yeah.

379
00:21:30,745 --> 00:21:34,725
Speaker 2:  The other product that you, you scooped is a new Bluetooth speaker coming

380
00:21:34,725 --> 00:21:38,565
Speaker 2:  from Sonos, which is I would say of all of the new Sonos stuff, maybe

381
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:40,485
Speaker 2:  the one I'm most excited about what's going on there.

382
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:45,045
Speaker 5:  The room two is coming soon as well. It looks just like the old one. So

383
00:21:45,145 --> 00:21:48,925
Speaker 5:  not much has changed there. Still very small. I have

384
00:21:48,945 --> 00:21:51,805
Speaker 5:  one, I like it fine. I think the move to is my favorite like Sonos overall

385
00:21:51,805 --> 00:21:55,445
Speaker 5:  product that's bigger obviously can't quite travel with it the same way as

386
00:21:55,445 --> 00:21:56,405
Speaker 5:  you can with The Roam. That's

387
00:21:56,405 --> 00:21:59,405
Speaker 2:  The one with the big handle, right? Yeah that thing is a brick but boy it

388
00:21:59,405 --> 00:21:59,685
Speaker 2:  sounds good.

389
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:02,205
Speaker 5:  Good. That's a brick. Yeah but the room was like a perfect shower speaker

390
00:22:02,205 --> 00:22:06,045
Speaker 5:  like you were saying so that could be an option for you. But I think like,

391
00:22:06,345 --> 00:22:09,485
Speaker 5:  you know, it's just pretty samey and there's a new button on the back so

392
00:22:09,485 --> 00:22:12,645
Speaker 5:  you can like pair it easily. Whereas before again you had to like be on your

393
00:22:12,645 --> 00:22:15,365
Speaker 5:  home wifi so you could set up a Bluetooth speaker. It's like what are we

394
00:22:15,365 --> 00:22:19,005
Speaker 5:  doing here? So now there's a button you can just set it up right away and

395
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:22,805
Speaker 5:  that'll be simpler. So that's like the main change from the first gen model.

396
00:22:22,945 --> 00:22:25,405
Speaker 5:  But yeah, there were some concerns with like the battery over long term so

397
00:22:25,405 --> 00:22:28,565
Speaker 5:  hopefully they've fixed some of that stuff so it'll last longer. But yeah,

398
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:31,805
Speaker 5:  it's a tiny little thing. Sounds decent for its size. I think that'll be

399
00:22:31,805 --> 00:22:35,325
Speaker 5:  out sometime this summer as well. So yeah tis the, tis the season for new

400
00:22:35,325 --> 00:22:35,685
Speaker 5:  speakers.

401
00:22:36,425 --> 00:22:39,765
Speaker 2:  I'm curious whether you think Sonos is

402
00:22:40,115 --> 00:22:43,965
Speaker 2:  pushing more towards trying to be a company like Bose that

403
00:22:43,965 --> 00:22:47,885
Speaker 2:  just kind of has a lineup of very good audio products or is gonna keep trying

404
00:22:47,885 --> 00:22:51,565
Speaker 2:  to find a way to like build a whole system. 'cause like the thing that worked

405
00:22:51,565 --> 00:22:54,965
Speaker 2:  for Sonos for so long I feel like was that it got better the more Sonos stuff

406
00:22:54,965 --> 00:22:58,885
Speaker 2:  you used. But then I look at things like the headphones and

407
00:22:58,905 --> 00:23:02,725
Speaker 2:  the Rome and again like any push that Sonos is gonna make

408
00:23:02,745 --> 00:23:06,725
Speaker 2:  to sort of make a true like mainstream product. Yeah. Seems

409
00:23:06,725 --> 00:23:10,485
Speaker 2:  like it pushes up against this idea of like building a beautiful little walled

410
00:23:10,485 --> 00:23:14,245
Speaker 2:  garden system for people who love good audio. Do you think can Sonos

411
00:23:14,305 --> 00:23:18,085
Speaker 2:  be both of those things or is it just going to have to lean

412
00:23:18,115 --> 00:23:21,805
Speaker 2:  into like we just sell audio products the end? I

413
00:23:21,805 --> 00:23:25,445
Speaker 5:  Don't know. I think they certainly can make a very, very good speaker. We've

414
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:28,765
Speaker 5:  learned that before. Can they like stand toe to toe on headphones with Bose

415
00:23:28,765 --> 00:23:32,605
Speaker 5:  and Apple and Sony and whoever else that remains to be

416
00:23:32,605 --> 00:23:35,045
Speaker 5:  seen. And like there are all these rumors of like a TV streaming device.

417
00:23:35,155 --> 00:23:38,645
Speaker 5:  It's like how, how can Sonos really play in that world and stand out versus

418
00:23:38,645 --> 00:23:42,365
Speaker 5:  Apple TV or Google tv. It's like, can you really like make a

419
00:23:42,595 --> 00:23:43,765
Speaker 5:  statement there? I

420
00:23:43,765 --> 00:23:44,405
Speaker 2:  Forgot about that.

421
00:23:44,805 --> 00:23:47,885
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that's kind of curious to me like what would a Sonos streamer look

422
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:51,285
Speaker 5:  like and why? So there's just a question of why as they go into the, these

423
00:23:51,285 --> 00:23:53,405
Speaker 5:  new product categories, I'm sure they're gonna have like a great reason for

424
00:23:53,405 --> 00:23:56,565
Speaker 5:  the headphones, you know. But as far as like a TV streamer, I don't really

425
00:23:56,565 --> 00:24:00,005
Speaker 5:  understand like what Sonos could do to really, you know, stand out from the

426
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:03,965
Speaker 5:  pack. But we'll see. I mean they do wanna build out obviously. So it

427
00:24:03,965 --> 00:24:06,885
Speaker 5:  should be a pretty fascinating next year for the company.

428
00:24:07,185 --> 00:24:10,765
Speaker 2:  It and it does that strategically. I can see the idea of

429
00:24:10,995 --> 00:24:14,045
Speaker 2:  just saying we make very good audio products. Yeah, we would like to make

430
00:24:14,045 --> 00:24:17,525
Speaker 2:  audio products that are accessible to more people. That totally tracks for

431
00:24:17,525 --> 00:24:21,005
Speaker 2:  me. But then I had, I honestly had totally forgotten about the TV streamer

432
00:24:21,005 --> 00:24:24,605
Speaker 2:  thing and there was, but but this is like now all of this is pouring back

433
00:24:24,695 --> 00:24:27,485
Speaker 2:  Sonos trying to be like, we are an operating system company. Like our main

434
00:24:27,575 --> 00:24:31,285
Speaker 2:  thing is the platform, which I feel like is such a fundamental misread of

435
00:24:31,285 --> 00:24:35,165
Speaker 2:  what people like about Sonos, that they've like tolerated crappy

436
00:24:35,195 --> 00:24:38,765
Speaker 2:  apps for so long because the sound is great and now Sonos is being like,

437
00:24:38,765 --> 00:24:40,645
Speaker 2:  forget the sound. It's all about the apps.

438
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:44,565
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I don't know if people wanna tell us to become Roku, but we'll see.

439
00:24:44,615 --> 00:24:46,245
Speaker 5:  We'll see what that looks like. Yeah.

440
00:24:46,435 --> 00:24:49,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's a boy I don't want anybody to become Roku right now.

441
00:24:50,345 --> 00:24:52,925
Speaker 2:  All right, so what, what's your sense of when are these headphones coming

442
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:53,925
Speaker 2:  out? Any, any news?

443
00:24:54,445 --> 00:24:58,245
Speaker 5:  The rumor is June, so it should be pretty soon honestly. So hopefully

444
00:24:58,245 --> 00:25:01,525
Speaker 5:  we'll get a pair and be able to do our tests and review and we'll see how

445
00:25:01,525 --> 00:25:05,085
Speaker 5:  that microphone compares to competition. Yeah, I'm really curious to see

446
00:25:05,085 --> 00:25:08,405
Speaker 5:  how they, like how the soundbar integration works and like the home theater

447
00:25:08,435 --> 00:25:12,365
Speaker 5:  support people love like private audio from the Roku and stuff. And so

448
00:25:12,365 --> 00:25:15,365
Speaker 5:  I think that would be a pretty compelling feature. So yeah, June

449
00:25:16,325 --> 00:25:19,685
Speaker 5:  sometime is the belief and yeah, should know more than,

450
00:25:20,075 --> 00:25:20,365
Speaker 5:  fair

451
00:25:20,365 --> 00:25:23,845
Speaker 2:  Enough. They do look good. The pictures you got, they're like simple.

452
00:25:24,075 --> 00:25:27,685
Speaker 2:  They, they had that sort of like almost a prototype look in a way that I

453
00:25:27,685 --> 00:25:31,005
Speaker 2:  really like. They're sort of undesigned in a very designy way. I'm

454
00:25:31,005 --> 00:25:34,125
Speaker 5:  Intense. Pretty not as heavy as the AirPods and Max thankfully because the

455
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:38,085
Speaker 5:  AirPods and Max are oof. They're heavy on your head

456
00:25:38,085 --> 00:25:40,805
Speaker 5:  after a while. That's fair. So these will be less heavy than that but yeah

457
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:44,605
Speaker 5:  they look nice. So good how, how they'll sound we should know in a few weeks.

458
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:47,645
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Alright, well when you get 'em, I'm thinking for the next mic test

459
00:25:47,655 --> 00:25:51,045
Speaker 2:  we're gonna send you in like a cave somewhere and just do the most

460
00:25:51,855 --> 00:25:55,325
Speaker 2:  echoy possible situation we can. Or we're gonna have you test a bunch of

461
00:25:55,325 --> 00:25:56,445
Speaker 2:  mics. It's gonna be a lot of fun.

462
00:25:56,705 --> 00:25:56,925
Speaker 5:  I'm

463
00:25:56,925 --> 00:25:59,525
Speaker 2:  Here for it Until then, thank you Chris. Appreciate it as always.

464
00:25:59,815 --> 00:26:00,285
Speaker 5:  Thank you.

465
00:26:01,155 --> 00:26:03,885
Speaker 2:  Alright, we gotta take a break and then we're gonna come back and talk about

466
00:26:03,885 --> 00:26:07,005
Speaker 2:  Right to Repair. We got a fun update for you on that front. We'll be right

467
00:26:07,005 --> 00:26:07,165
Speaker 2:  back.

468
00:28:54,155 --> 00:28:57,925
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. We've been covering rate to repair a lot on this show

469
00:28:57,955 --> 00:29:01,365
Speaker 2:  over really the last couple of years. And it turns out just in the last couple

470
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:05,245
Speaker 2:  of months a lot of stuff has been happening. Oregon just passed what is

471
00:29:05,405 --> 00:29:08,885
Speaker 2:  probably the strongest rate to repair Bill we've seen yet, which includes

472
00:29:08,925 --> 00:29:12,885
Speaker 2:  a ban on parts pairing Apple is slowly and somewhat

473
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:16,725
Speaker 2:  sketchily starting to change some of its repair practices, especially around

474
00:29:16,725 --> 00:29:20,045
Speaker 2:  parked pairing. There's just a lot going on and the right to repair industry

475
00:29:20,065 --> 00:29:23,765
Speaker 2:  is changing really fast. Will pour on. Our team has been looking into this

476
00:29:24,105 --> 00:29:28,045
Speaker 2:  for a while and is now back, I think after breaking several phones

477
00:29:28,075 --> 00:29:29,125
Speaker 2:  will pour. Welcome back.

478
00:29:29,585 --> 00:29:33,405
Speaker 11:  Hi. Thank you. Yeah, I have a growing drawer full

479
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:37,245
Speaker 11:  of really brutalized iPhones after doing

480
00:29:37,305 --> 00:29:40,685
Speaker 11:  the story and we will get into why, but I, I am now

481
00:29:41,015 --> 00:29:44,925
Speaker 11:  going to be a used iPhone broker myself after all of this,

482
00:29:45,385 --> 00:29:46,325
Speaker 11:  so we'll see how that goes.

483
00:29:46,665 --> 00:29:47,485
Speaker 2:  So what have you been up to?

484
00:29:47,865 --> 00:29:51,805
Speaker 11:  So I have been following all this legislation that you're talking about

485
00:29:51,905 --> 00:29:55,365
Speaker 11:  and the company's changing policies, all this really high level stuff and

486
00:29:55,365 --> 00:29:58,925
Speaker 11:  it was starting to just feel abstract to me. And so

487
00:29:59,585 --> 00:30:03,565
Speaker 11:  as I have been following it all, wanted to just take a break and

488
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:07,525
Speaker 11:  get some stuff fixed to just see what these repair

489
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:11,605
Speaker 11:  practices actually look like in real life and see what repair issues

490
00:30:11,605 --> 00:30:15,485
Speaker 11:  bubble up over the course of doing real repairs. So my

491
00:30:15,485 --> 00:30:19,125
Speaker 11:  idea was to just collect a bunch of broken iPhones, take them to the Apple

492
00:30:19,135 --> 00:30:22,965
Speaker 11:  store first for kind of an official diagnosis and then take

493
00:30:22,965 --> 00:30:26,645
Speaker 11:  those same phones with the same problems to an independent repair shop and

494
00:30:26,745 --> 00:30:30,725
Speaker 11:  see what repairs each store offered. How

495
00:30:30,725 --> 00:30:34,565
Speaker 11:  knowledgeable the Apple store was in an independent store was how much the

496
00:30:34,565 --> 00:30:38,325
Speaker 11:  repairs would cost. I just wanted to see what repair

497
00:30:38,685 --> 00:30:42,165
Speaker 11:  advocates are fighting for specifically and why they're fighting so hard

498
00:30:42,305 --> 00:30:46,125
Speaker 11:  for these independent shops. So that was the plan. And for the record, I

499
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:49,125
Speaker 11:  know a lot of the issues we're gonna talk about here are not unique to Apple,

500
00:30:49,545 --> 00:30:53,165
Speaker 11:  but as we've talked about, apple products are just so ubiquitous that

501
00:30:53,345 --> 00:30:57,085
Speaker 11:  so many of these repair shops literally live or die based on how

502
00:30:57,085 --> 00:31:00,885
Speaker 11:  repairable Apple devices are. And the company has just fought against

503
00:31:00,885 --> 00:31:04,805
Speaker 11:  Repairability so hard for so long that Apple is just the

504
00:31:04,805 --> 00:31:08,085
Speaker 11:  center of this story. So lots of iPhones in this story. Yeah,

505
00:31:08,085 --> 00:31:10,525
Speaker 2:  That's a good caveat. I forget who it was but somebody a while back said

506
00:31:10,525 --> 00:31:14,325
Speaker 2:  to me, basically Apple is not the only company that

507
00:31:14,325 --> 00:31:18,125
Speaker 2:  matters in right to repair, but none of the other companies cumulative

508
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:22,005
Speaker 2:  matter as much as Apple does. Yeah. So like it, it is the center of the

509
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,485
Speaker 2:  story feels like exactly the right way to describe it. It's not the whole

510
00:31:24,485 --> 00:31:26,045
Speaker 2:  thing but it is the most thing.

511
00:31:26,345 --> 00:31:30,285
Speaker 11:  Yes. And and every, you know, repair expert I talk to will say the exact

512
00:31:30,285 --> 00:31:32,565
Speaker 11:  same thing and then all the examples they'll use are Apple.

513
00:31:32,915 --> 00:31:36,405
Speaker 2:  Okay. So I love the first task of this, which is that you had to find a way

514
00:31:36,425 --> 00:31:40,245
Speaker 2:  to have a bunch of broken phones. How does one acquire a bunch of broken

515
00:31:40,245 --> 00:31:40,605
Speaker 2:  phones?

516
00:31:41,285 --> 00:31:44,925
Speaker 11:  I try. I mean I like I started with the company Slack, I, I started

517
00:31:44,925 --> 00:31:48,605
Speaker 11:  asking friends and family I, it was like a really weird thing to go looking

518
00:31:48,705 --> 00:31:52,325
Speaker 11:  for. Turns out eBay. The, the answer is eBay. There are 1

519
00:31:52,425 --> 00:31:55,885
Speaker 11:  million phones in that are broken in very specific ways on eBay.

520
00:31:56,185 --> 00:31:57,685
Speaker 2:  What's the lineup that we ended up with?

521
00:31:58,065 --> 00:32:01,645
Speaker 11:  So I saw a ton of broken screens and dead

522
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:05,725
Speaker 11:  batteries. I wanted to skip those because we know the Apple store will

523
00:32:05,725 --> 00:32:09,645
Speaker 11:  repair those. They've got the prices listed, they have this DIY

524
00:32:09,645 --> 00:32:13,085
Speaker 11:  repair program for those independent shops will do it. That is the most

525
00:32:13,085 --> 00:32:16,765
Speaker 11:  common churn for repairs. So I went looking

526
00:32:16,945 --> 00:32:20,845
Speaker 11:  for, I don't know, slightly more interesting repairs than that. The

527
00:32:20,845 --> 00:32:24,645
Speaker 11:  things that I found, one, I bought a working iPhone eight with a

528
00:32:24,645 --> 00:32:28,205
Speaker 11:  broken charging port. Okay. That I hear happens a lot.

529
00:32:28,455 --> 00:32:31,645
Speaker 11:  We're just gonna call that one the charge port phone. The second one was

530
00:32:31,725 --> 00:32:35,565
Speaker 11:  a, a second gen iPhone SE with a cracked screen that

531
00:32:35,675 --> 00:32:39,605
Speaker 11:  also for some reason the listing said just rebooted itself every

532
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:42,725
Speaker 11:  few minutes. Oh weird. So that seemed interesting. I we're gonna call that

533
00:32:42,725 --> 00:32:46,445
Speaker 11:  one the boot looper. Okay. And then one wild card that I

534
00:32:46,535 --> 00:32:50,365
Speaker 11:  could not resist buying was a really nice looking iPhone

535
00:32:50,725 --> 00:32:54,645
Speaker 11:  14 pro that the listing said was quote in salt water for a

536
00:32:54,645 --> 00:32:58,405
Speaker 11:  while. I had to see what everyone would say about that one. We're gonna

537
00:32:58,405 --> 00:32:59,485
Speaker 11:  call that one Rusty

538
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:04,005
Speaker 2:  In saltwater for a while. Feels like a euphemism for how terrible this

539
00:33:04,005 --> 00:33:06,605
Speaker 2:  thing is that I'm now very worried about what's gonna happen to this phone.

540
00:33:06,955 --> 00:33:09,965
Speaker 11:  This is the thing, it looked really nice. It just had this like kind of

541
00:33:10,025 --> 00:33:13,885
Speaker 11:  artful corrosion along the metal rim of it. It actually like, it looked

542
00:33:13,885 --> 00:33:17,565
Speaker 11:  really nice. I was really hoping that I could get it fixed,

543
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,645
Speaker 11:  just that I could use it myself. What,

544
00:33:19,645 --> 00:33:22,325
Speaker 2:  What was the total budget for the broken phones here? What'd you end up spending

545
00:33:22,325 --> 00:33:23,125
Speaker 2:  for these three phones?

546
00:33:23,945 --> 00:33:27,925
Speaker 11:  Too much because I, I fell into the eBay trap. I like want, I like saw

547
00:33:27,925 --> 00:33:30,405
Speaker 11:  these phones and I wanted them because I thought that they would be like

548
00:33:30,745 --> 00:33:33,645
Speaker 11:  fun storytelling devices. The first two were

549
00:33:34,385 --> 00:33:38,205
Speaker 11:  fairly cheap in the, I think I spent 40 bucks on

550
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:42,165
Speaker 11:  one and Oh okay. 60 on another or something. The 14 pro

551
00:33:42,765 --> 00:33:45,725
Speaker 11:  I think I spent like $75 on. Oh that's

552
00:33:45,725 --> 00:33:49,245
Speaker 2:  Not bad. I mean that's last year's phone. I almost expected it to be significantly

553
00:33:49,245 --> 00:33:52,285
Speaker 2:  more than that actually. Yeah. Alright, so we're, we're a couple hundred

554
00:33:52,285 --> 00:33:56,005
Speaker 2:  dollars in, you've got some deeply busted phones and

555
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,725
Speaker 2:  what step one was you, you said you were gonna take 'em to the Apple store,

556
00:33:58,725 --> 00:33:58,965
Speaker 2:  right?

557
00:33:59,155 --> 00:34:02,605
Speaker 11:  Yeah, step one was just walk into an Apple store. So I, I made an appointment,

558
00:34:02,925 --> 00:34:06,685
Speaker 11:  I showed up at the store with these, these three phones in my bag. I

559
00:34:06,685 --> 00:34:10,525
Speaker 11:  didn't even try to get permission to record at the Apple store 'cause I

560
00:34:10,525 --> 00:34:14,165
Speaker 11:  didn't wanna be like, I'm a journalist doing an experiment. So I, I had

561
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:18,125
Speaker 11:  to just go in and go out and then just record some voice notes. But I

562
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:21,645
Speaker 11:  can tell you exactly what the Apple texts said about each one of these phones.

563
00:34:22,225 --> 00:34:26,005
Speaker 11:  So first the iPhone eight with the bad charge port, just not

564
00:34:26,005 --> 00:34:29,565
Speaker 11:  repairable by Apple, it's charge ports are not a thing that they

565
00:34:29,845 --> 00:34:33,245
Speaker 11:  fix. Instead their best offer was

566
00:34:33,255 --> 00:34:37,205
Speaker 11:  $350 for a refurbished iPhone eight if

567
00:34:37,285 --> 00:34:40,845
Speaker 11:  I traded this one in, which didn't make a lot of sense. Walmart

568
00:34:41,135 --> 00:34:44,605
Speaker 11:  sells the same model and the same configuration refurbished for like

569
00:34:44,645 --> 00:34:48,485
Speaker 11:  $125. And then their other option was a

570
00:34:48,685 --> 00:34:52,405
Speaker 11:  new SE for $430. So that's the charge port phone,

571
00:34:52,745 --> 00:34:56,645
Speaker 11:  the rebooting SE two with the cracked screen. I explained what was going

572
00:34:56,645 --> 00:35:00,405
Speaker 11:  on. They did try to run a diagnostic on it, but the phone kept

573
00:35:00,645 --> 00:35:03,845
Speaker 11:  rebooting before the test could finish. So instead they poked around in

574
00:35:03,845 --> 00:35:07,205
Speaker 11:  the settings and they saw that the phone had a third party battery in it.

575
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:10,925
Speaker 11:  And that was kind of it for them. They decided that must be the culprit.

576
00:35:10,995 --> 00:35:14,525
Speaker 11:  They didn't say why a battery would cause a boot loop. They were just like,

577
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:18,405
Speaker 11:  ah, third party batteries cause problems. And that was the end of the conversation.

578
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:22,405
Speaker 11:  So they said that they could replace the battery for $89 but they also said

579
00:35:22,405 --> 00:35:26,285
Speaker 11:  that the screen would shatter when they tried to remove it. So I'd

580
00:35:26,285 --> 00:35:30,205
Speaker 11:  need to pay another 269 for a new display. So grand

581
00:35:30,205 --> 00:35:34,045
Speaker 11:  total for that phone was $358 and

582
00:35:34,045 --> 00:35:37,445
Speaker 11:  fingers crossed it, the battery was actually the problem and that it would

583
00:35:37,445 --> 00:35:41,165
Speaker 11:  iFixit or again I could get a new se. They really, they kept on

584
00:35:41,165 --> 00:35:45,125
Speaker 11:  trying to sell me a new se. So that was that one. And then the, and then

585
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:48,525
Speaker 11:  the iPhone 14 pro was just a full, nah,

586
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:52,925
Speaker 11:  the guy checking me in at the store told me that they just don't repair

587
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:56,685
Speaker 11:  anything with water damage. Which was a little surprising to me because

588
00:35:56,995 --> 00:36:00,565
Speaker 11:  like water damage is a repair category on the Apple

589
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:04,605
Speaker 11:  repair website. So long story short, that was the Apple store. I was in

590
00:36:04,605 --> 00:36:07,245
Speaker 11:  and out in 10 minutes with zero phones fixed.

591
00:36:07,705 --> 00:36:11,685
Speaker 2:  So on the one hand I'm not shocked by that. On the other hand I'm starting

592
00:36:11,685 --> 00:36:15,605
Speaker 2:  to think what does Apple fix? You know, you mentioned batteries and

593
00:36:15,605 --> 00:36:19,405
Speaker 2:  screens, these are fairly straightforward. Is there a list sort of

594
00:36:19,765 --> 00:36:23,325
Speaker 2:  official or unofficial of the repairs? Apple actually will do

595
00:36:23,665 --> 00:36:24,605
Speaker 2:  at an Apple store.

596
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:29,045
Speaker 11:  You can't really tell from their website. Whenever I

597
00:36:29,045 --> 00:36:32,925
Speaker 11:  ask an independent repair tech about this, they tell

598
00:36:33,045 --> 00:36:36,845
Speaker 11:  me to just go to the schedule A genius bar visit page because

599
00:36:36,865 --> 00:36:40,645
Speaker 11:  it has these big buttons for selecting the repair that you need. There's

600
00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:44,365
Speaker 11:  a cracked screen button, a dead battery button, camera problems. And they

601
00:36:44,365 --> 00:36:47,965
Speaker 11:  basically say if there isn't a button you can press, then they're not gonna

602
00:36:47,965 --> 00:36:49,285
Speaker 11:  do the repair. So

603
00:36:49,315 --> 00:36:53,245
Speaker 2:  This is a successful case potentially for why there should be other

604
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:56,525
Speaker 2:  people in the world repairing these things than the people at the Genius

605
00:36:56,625 --> 00:36:58,365
Speaker 2:  Bar. And that's where you went next, right?

606
00:36:58,745 --> 00:37:02,325
Speaker 11:  Yes. Yeah. I basically, I live here in Seattle. I poked around on Yelp.

607
00:37:02,565 --> 00:37:06,325
Speaker 11:  I landed on a place called Jet City Device Repair. They've been around for

608
00:37:06,325 --> 00:37:10,245
Speaker 11:  more than 15 years. They've got a couple locations and the area, they've

609
00:37:10,245 --> 00:37:14,165
Speaker 11:  got good reviews. So I just, I made an appointment to bring my

610
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:15,885
Speaker 11:  phones in and chat with the owner.

611
00:37:16,385 --> 00:37:19,485
Speaker 12:  Did somebody respond to Julia and let her know that if she's close enough

612
00:37:19,485 --> 00:37:22,725
Speaker 12:  and can make it in by five, we can still take her in? If not, we have plenty

613
00:37:22,725 --> 00:37:23,325
Speaker 12:  of time tomorrow.

614
00:37:23,865 --> 00:37:27,525
Speaker 11:  So the shop was like the opposite of an Apple store. It was a little cramped,

615
00:37:27,605 --> 00:37:31,245
Speaker 11:  a little messy, a little scrappy. There was this cushy front of house

616
00:37:31,255 --> 00:37:34,925
Speaker 11:  where customers can hang out on a couch and wait for the repairs. And in

617
00:37:34,925 --> 00:37:38,685
Speaker 11:  the back were three or so people working at desks

618
00:37:38,685 --> 00:37:42,085
Speaker 11:  that had mats and lights and microscopes and some tools.

619
00:37:42,505 --> 00:37:46,205
Speaker 11:  And then in the back there was a store room with like a million tiny little

620
00:37:46,585 --> 00:37:50,565
Speaker 11:  bagged parts for every major cell phone that you could really name.

621
00:37:51,025 --> 00:37:54,525
Speaker 11:  Jet City's owner Sava Popal brought me back to the store room

622
00:37:54,865 --> 00:37:58,765
Speaker 11:  to check out my phones. So I brought a couple of things to look

623
00:37:58,765 --> 00:38:02,445
Speaker 11:  at. I figure I can just show you what I brought and

624
00:38:02,835 --> 00:38:06,485
Speaker 11:  tell you what the Apple Store said about each of them.

625
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:07,325
Speaker 12:  That's exciting.

626
00:38:07,905 --> 00:38:11,765
Speaker 11:  So first the charge port phone, the Apple store said it was a non-starter

627
00:38:12,105 --> 00:38:15,645
Speaker 11:  but Jet City fixes charging ports all the time in a lot of cases

628
00:38:15,715 --> 00:38:19,165
Speaker 11:  because the Apple store won't OSH quoted me $90,

629
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:23,045
Speaker 11:  which is getting kind of close to a similar used phone

630
00:38:23,045 --> 00:38:26,725
Speaker 11:  online, but I don't know, it'll keep one more phone outta the garbage dump.

631
00:38:26,985 --> 00:38:30,725
Speaker 11:  So I, I said go for it. So OSH took the phone and used his

632
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:34,325
Speaker 11:  microscope to look at the tiny little pins inside the lightning port.

633
00:38:34,705 --> 00:38:35,445
Speaker 11:  And what are you seeing?

634
00:38:36,405 --> 00:38:40,325
Speaker 12:  I am seeing all the pins are damaged. They weren't great

635
00:38:40,705 --> 00:38:43,805
Speaker 12:  to begin with though 'cause they have a little bit of corrosion on them.

636
00:38:44,315 --> 00:38:48,045
Speaker 11:  From what Sava has seen, the Apple stores just aren't built

637
00:38:48,105 --> 00:38:52,005
Speaker 11:  for a repair like this, even though it's a really common one. Instead he

638
00:38:52,005 --> 00:38:55,765
Speaker 11:  says Apple has this wildly over-engineered process

639
00:38:56,145 --> 00:38:59,925
Speaker 11:  for just a few select repairs like screens and batteries.

640
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:04,685
Speaker 12:  It's like extra with like extra Xs, you know, it's just

641
00:39:05,105 --> 00:39:07,845
Speaker 12:  so much going on. What do you mean by that? They have like, they have this

642
00:39:08,345 --> 00:39:12,165
Speaker 12:  one device that sort of holds the whole

643
00:39:12,165 --> 00:39:15,845
Speaker 12:  phone together so it doesn't move around. There's another device that holds

644
00:39:15,845 --> 00:39:19,605
Speaker 12:  the screen open for you while you're removing the screen. It's like

645
00:39:19,905 --> 00:39:23,725
Speaker 12:  so much going on that you don't really need. And you see my kit is

646
00:39:23,725 --> 00:39:24,765
Speaker 12:  this tiny little thing.

647
00:39:25,225 --> 00:39:28,885
Speaker 11:  His toolbox is one of those pencil cases he used in grade school. I see

648
00:39:29,005 --> 00:39:31,205
Speaker 11:  a toothbrush. I see an Exacto knife.

649
00:39:31,475 --> 00:39:31,765
Speaker 12:  Yeah.

650
00:39:32,265 --> 00:39:36,245
Speaker 11:  So for the repair Sava took two little screws out of the bottom of

651
00:39:36,245 --> 00:39:39,725
Speaker 11:  the phone, then slid a little plastic tool around the edge of the screen

652
00:39:39,825 --> 00:39:43,205
Speaker 11:  and popped it off to reveal the guts of the phone. And then he just starts

653
00:39:43,485 --> 00:39:47,005
Speaker 11:  removing screw after screw from different components to get down to the

654
00:39:47,205 --> 00:39:51,005
Speaker 11:  charging port. So why do you think a charging

655
00:39:51,115 --> 00:39:54,285
Speaker 11:  port is something that is just outside of

656
00:39:54,715 --> 00:39:56,605
Speaker 11:  apple's supported repairs?

657
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:59,925
Speaker 12:  It's complicated. There are a lot of screws.

658
00:40:00,345 --> 00:40:01,165
Speaker 11:  God, those are tiny.

659
00:40:01,515 --> 00:40:04,205
Speaker 12:  Yeah, they're, they're very small and you don't wanna mix them up because

660
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,045
Speaker 12:  most of the screws are different from each other.

661
00:40:06,965 --> 00:40:10,725
Speaker 11:  Actually just combed through an iFixit repair guide for this model of iPhone.

662
00:40:10,865 --> 00:40:14,645
Speaker 11:  And I counted 14 different sizes and kinds of

663
00:40:14,705 --> 00:40:16,485
Speaker 11:  screws for this charge port repair.

664
00:40:16,745 --> 00:40:20,165
Speaker 12:  You have to remove the entire motherboard to get access to the port. Then

665
00:40:20,165 --> 00:40:22,525
Speaker 12:  the port itself has a bunch of screws.

666
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:26,805
Speaker 11:  Does it just feel like is just not worth the time

667
00:40:26,805 --> 00:40:28,085
Speaker 11:  and effort if you're Apple?

668
00:40:28,805 --> 00:40:32,725
Speaker 12:  I think they're incentivized to focus on selling rather

669
00:40:32,725 --> 00:40:36,645
Speaker 12:  than repairing. So if they can say, Hey we provide repairs for

670
00:40:36,925 --> 00:40:40,405
Speaker 12:  batteries and screens, then they can say we do provide

671
00:40:40,475 --> 00:40:43,925
Speaker 12:  repairs. But if it's anything else you're just gonna have to buy a new device.

672
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:47,805
Speaker 12:  They're incentivized to do that because it's a sales

673
00:40:47,805 --> 00:40:48,445
Speaker 12:  conversion.

674
00:40:48,925 --> 00:40:52,885
Speaker 11:  I asked Apple about charge port repairs and Brian Nauman, who

675
00:40:52,885 --> 00:40:56,845
Speaker 11:  is the VP of Apple's repair business, told me that the company does offer

676
00:40:56,845 --> 00:41:00,525
Speaker 11:  them If. you have an iPhone 12 or newer and If, you mail the phone

677
00:41:00,965 --> 00:41:04,765
Speaker 11:  directly into Apple. He didn't explain why they don't work with older phones.

678
00:41:05,175 --> 00:41:08,565
Speaker 11:  Which is interesting because as we got deeper into the repair,

679
00:41:09,065 --> 00:41:13,045
Speaker 11:  we ran into a hint that Apple might not want anyone fixing this part.

680
00:41:13,585 --> 00:41:17,325
Speaker 12:  So this connector, when you remove it, there is

681
00:41:17,525 --> 00:41:21,165
Speaker 12:  a tape. Tiny, tiny, tiny little piece of tape. Well the

682
00:41:21,165 --> 00:41:25,085
Speaker 12:  neoprene actually hides a screw underneath this. So you don't

683
00:41:25,085 --> 00:41:28,125
Speaker 12:  even realize that there's a screw down there. We didn't realize it until

684
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:32,005
Speaker 12:  like, we couldn't figure out why the board wasn't coming up. Yeah. And

685
00:41:32,005 --> 00:41:35,245
Speaker 12:  these are delicate boards. So If, you don't have experience, you're gonna

686
00:41:35,575 --> 00:41:38,445
Speaker 12:  apply a little bit too much pressure and it's gonna end up cracking.

687
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:42,085
Speaker 11:  Gotcha. And is there, can you think of a design

688
00:41:42,225 --> 00:41:44,445
Speaker 11:  reason for that little piece of tape

689
00:41:44,445 --> 00:41:47,885
Speaker 12:  There? No, because it's, it's not coming into contact with any metals. Yeah.

690
00:41:47,985 --> 00:41:51,765
Speaker 12:  Or any like anything exposed. So the only reason

691
00:41:51,825 --> 00:41:53,045
Speaker 12:  is to hide that screw

692
00:41:53,575 --> 00:41:57,565
Speaker 11:  Brian Nauman from Apple disputed that the tape was meant to hide anything.

693
00:41:58,025 --> 00:42:02,005
Speaker 11:  He said it was grounding tape there to quote, protect the electrical circuitry.

694
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:06,525
Speaker 11:  Anyway, OSH fished a new charge port out of his wall of bagged parts.

695
00:42:06,985 --> 00:42:10,805
Speaker 11:  He connected to the phone, tested it, and put the whole thing back together

696
00:42:10,805 --> 00:42:11,125
Speaker 11:  again.

697
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:15,365
Speaker 2:  So just like that we're we're, we're up and running again. What, 90 bucks

698
00:42:15,415 --> 00:42:18,245
Speaker 2:  later And you have a working iPhone eight. Yeah,

699
00:42:18,565 --> 00:42:18,805
Speaker 11:  Absolutely.

700
00:42:18,945 --> 00:42:20,085
Speaker 2:  How long did this whole thing take?

701
00:42:20,465 --> 00:42:24,005
Speaker 11:  It took us like an hour, but that was because I was literally like looking

702
00:42:24,005 --> 00:42:27,565
Speaker 11:  over ASHA's shoulder and asking him questions every 30 seconds. He says

703
00:42:27,585 --> 00:42:31,245
Speaker 11:  he can swap a charge ported out in like 20 minutes 'cause he's done a million

704
00:42:31,245 --> 00:42:31,565
Speaker 11:  of them.

705
00:42:31,905 --> 00:42:34,885
Speaker 2:  I'm sure he loved you during this whole process. He's like, leave me alone.

706
00:42:34,905 --> 00:42:35,565
Speaker 2:  Let me do my job.

707
00:42:35,995 --> 00:42:39,485
Speaker 11:  It's, I know it's a very zen process of keeping track of all of these screws

708
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:43,285
Speaker 11:  and I, I am not a zen person when I am. I just on the best of days, but

709
00:42:43,285 --> 00:42:46,125
Speaker 11:  especially not when I'm interviewing. So I can't imagine that went well.

710
00:42:46,435 --> 00:42:46,725
Speaker 11:  Yeah,

711
00:42:46,725 --> 00:42:50,565
Speaker 2:  Fair enough. Alright, well repair shop one Apple, store zero.

712
00:42:50,785 --> 00:42:51,325
Speaker 2:  What's next?

713
00:42:51,385 --> 00:42:55,365
Speaker 11:  Yes. So next is the boot looper. This is the, the phone that just

714
00:42:55,535 --> 00:42:59,245
Speaker 11:  reset itself for no reason. I explained the problem to

715
00:42:59,525 --> 00:43:03,325
Speaker 11:  Avav and I gave him the Apple store's diagnosis. Their best guess was

716
00:43:03,325 --> 00:43:05,365
Speaker 11:  that it was a battery problem.

717
00:43:05,825 --> 00:43:09,165
Speaker 12:  No, it's the charging port. It's either the charging port or the power volume

718
00:43:09,165 --> 00:43:09,485
Speaker 12:  button.

719
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:13,365
Speaker 2:  Wait, will, is everything a charging port? Like is the, is the secret to

720
00:43:13,365 --> 00:43:15,885
Speaker 2:  repairing your phone? Just that the charging port is always the problem.

721
00:43:16,405 --> 00:43:19,765
Speaker 11:  I mean apparently this is, this is what happens when you like genuinely

722
00:43:20,105 --> 00:43:23,045
Speaker 11:  buy broken phones and don't know what it'll take to fix them. Sometimes

723
00:43:23,045 --> 00:43:26,805
Speaker 11:  you just end up with a bunch of broken charging ports. The deal here is

724
00:43:26,805 --> 00:43:30,645
Speaker 11:  that it's not the charging port per se, it's the sensor that sits on

725
00:43:30,645 --> 00:43:34,365
Speaker 11:  the charging port. The quote charging port is actually

726
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:37,885
Speaker 11:  a whole bunch of different components that are all bundled together. There's

727
00:43:37,885 --> 00:43:41,765
Speaker 11:  the port, there's the sensor, there's some speakers, there's the vibration

728
00:43:41,935 --> 00:43:45,525
Speaker 11:  motor. So that's all one part that you can swap in and out.

729
00:43:45,905 --> 00:43:49,645
Speaker 2:  Got it. So it's basically like that sort of bottom stripe of your phone is

730
00:43:49,665 --> 00:43:51,605
Speaker 2:  all one thing and whatever breaks the whole thing

731
00:43:51,605 --> 00:43:54,165
Speaker 11:  Breaks. That's the replaceable thing. Okay. That's the thing that you can

732
00:43:54,185 --> 00:43:57,565
Speaker 11:  buy replacement parts for. Got it. Anyway, as soon as I told

733
00:43:58,005 --> 00:44:01,885
Speaker 11:  Avav that the phone was rebooting, quote every few minutes he

734
00:44:01,885 --> 00:44:05,365
Speaker 11:  said, oh, it's every three minutes. This is a thing that he's seeing a lot.

735
00:44:05,585 --> 00:44:08,445
Speaker 11:  And it usually means there's a bad temperature sensor somewhere.

736
00:44:08,995 --> 00:44:12,965
Speaker 12:  What happens is when the device shuts off every three

737
00:44:12,965 --> 00:44:16,685
Speaker 12:  minutes, yeah, there are temperature sensors around the device that

738
00:44:17,265 --> 00:44:21,165
Speaker 12:  report what the temperature is. If one of those sensors fails

739
00:44:21,545 --> 00:44:25,485
Speaker 12:  and it can't report, then the device as a safety precaution

740
00:44:25,485 --> 00:44:29,325
Speaker 12:  will turn off, it'll turn back on and then the same thing happens.

741
00:44:29,385 --> 00:44:30,805
Speaker 12:  Yes. And it checks every three minutes.

742
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:35,045
Speaker 11:  He booted up the phone and he found the device's analytics files,

743
00:44:35,535 --> 00:44:39,245
Speaker 11:  which I had no idea existed. And for the record, the Apple Tech

744
00:44:39,505 --> 00:44:43,445
Speaker 11:  did not do, the files are actually not that hard to find. They're in

745
00:44:43,445 --> 00:44:47,365
Speaker 11:  the privacy and security setting screen. But you've gotta know what you're

746
00:44:47,365 --> 00:44:51,085
Speaker 11:  looking for when you look at them. 'cause it's one of those walls of gibberish

747
00:44:51,115 --> 00:44:51,405
Speaker 11:  text

748
00:44:51,825 --> 00:44:54,005
Speaker 12:  And then you wanna find where it says panic. Oh,

749
00:44:54,005 --> 00:44:55,645
Speaker 11:  Okay. That's the panic is the reset.

750
00:44:56,035 --> 00:44:59,845
Speaker 12:  Yeah. And then when you go there in that first

751
00:45:00,225 --> 00:45:02,725
Speaker 12:  big block of text, it'll say missing sensors.

752
00:45:03,065 --> 00:45:06,925
Speaker 11:  The panic log told him that. Yep. The culprit is probably a sensor

753
00:45:07,065 --> 00:45:10,765
Speaker 11:  on the charging port. So yes, we needed to replace this

754
00:45:10,765 --> 00:45:14,285
Speaker 11:  phone's charging port too and just see if that stopped the reboot.

755
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:18,165
Speaker 11:  So same process as the last phone. Although one notable detail,

756
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:22,085
Speaker 11:  this is the phone with the crack screen that Apple said, oh, If, you open

757
00:45:22,085 --> 00:45:24,645
Speaker 11:  it up, it'll totally shatter the screen. So you have to replace that too.

758
00:45:25,265 --> 00:45:28,885
Speaker 11:  But I don't know, I watched AV pop the screen off without any problem

759
00:45:29,265 --> 00:45:32,645
Speaker 11:  for whatever that's worth. Anyway, we plugged in the replacement part and

760
00:45:32,645 --> 00:45:35,485
Speaker 11:  we turned on the phone to see if it would stay on this time.

761
00:45:36,095 --> 00:45:37,605
Speaker 12:  We'll make it a five minute timer.

762
00:45:38,105 --> 00:45:40,765
Speaker 11:  All right, so now we've got five minutes to figure out

763
00:45:41,185 --> 00:45:41,645
Speaker 12:  If that

764
00:45:42,105 --> 00:45:45,685
Speaker 11:  Is the culprit, but after exactly three minutes,

765
00:45:46,385 --> 00:45:47,165
Speaker 11:  the phone reset.

766
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:48,605
Speaker 12:  Oh, a little phone.

767
00:45:49,185 --> 00:45:53,085
Speaker 11:  We tried that meant that the problem might actually be

768
00:45:53,085 --> 00:45:56,725
Speaker 11:  in the motherboard, which for a phone that's worth maybe a hundred dollars

769
00:45:56,945 --> 00:46:00,885
Speaker 11:  is probably too much trouble to fix. But we wanted to rule everything

770
00:46:00,885 --> 00:46:04,405
Speaker 11:  else out. So just in case the replacement part

771
00:46:04,755 --> 00:46:08,365
Speaker 11:  also had a bad sensor. We tried a couple more identical parts from

772
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:12,485
Speaker 11:  Sasha's inventory. All of those failed to, we also verified that the

773
00:46:12,485 --> 00:46:16,365
Speaker 11:  battery was fine since that was Apple's gas. It was fine. At

774
00:46:16,365 --> 00:46:19,685
Speaker 11:  one point we actually lost track of the timer and we thought that we had

775
00:46:19,725 --> 00:46:22,005
Speaker 11:  a working phone for a second. Oh,

776
00:46:22,175 --> 00:46:24,725
Speaker 12:  We're it worked. Ah. Oh, there you go.

777
00:46:25,105 --> 00:46:26,165
Speaker 11:  But it reset again.

778
00:46:26,435 --> 00:46:27,125
Speaker 12:  Motherboard.

779
00:46:27,955 --> 00:46:31,365
Speaker 11:  Motherboard. So that was it for the boot looper.

780
00:46:31,745 --> 00:46:35,325
Speaker 2:  So we gave, we gave up on this one. It was, it was the end of the boot looper.

781
00:46:35,345 --> 00:46:38,485
Speaker 11:  It was the end of the line for the boot looper. Okay. Yeah. Mother motherboard

782
00:46:38,485 --> 00:46:40,725
Speaker 11:  problem is bad news. Right.

783
00:46:40,745 --> 00:46:44,325
Speaker 2:  And in this case, I, I suspect it ends up just being a pretty straight

784
00:46:44,355 --> 00:46:48,045
Speaker 2:  financial decision. Like yes, you could replace the whole thing and sort

785
00:46:48,045 --> 00:46:51,765
Speaker 2:  of like ship a thesis your phone into a new phone, but at that point

786
00:46:52,025 --> 00:46:55,165
Speaker 2:  it is probably a lot more expensive than just taking whatever deal Apple

787
00:46:55,165 --> 00:46:56,245
Speaker 2:  would've given you. Yeah,

788
00:46:56,245 --> 00:46:59,685
Speaker 11:  Exactly. Okay. Or even If, you don't take Apple's deal. There are cheaper

789
00:46:59,685 --> 00:47:01,205
Speaker 11:  phones online. Just, just walk away.

790
00:47:01,395 --> 00:47:04,405
Speaker 2:  Yeah, go, go buy a different broken one on eBay and just try thing

791
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:07,005
Speaker 11:  Again. Yeah, fix that one. Yeah, just go through it all again. Have better

792
00:47:07,005 --> 00:47:07,285
Speaker 11:  luck.

793
00:47:07,595 --> 00:47:11,005
Speaker 2:  Okay. Alright, so we're, we're at one to one. It's tiebreaker time.

794
00:47:11,465 --> 00:47:15,365
Speaker 2:  Can we fix these phones? We have one that works. We, that is

795
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:19,325
Speaker 2:  broken forever. How are you feeling at this point in the process? I

796
00:47:19,325 --> 00:47:22,805
Speaker 2:  feel like at the very least you've been given access to a lot more

797
00:47:22,805 --> 00:47:26,765
Speaker 2:  information and process with the independent repair than

798
00:47:26,765 --> 00:47:27,845
Speaker 2:  you were at the Apple store.

799
00:47:28,155 --> 00:47:32,115
Speaker 11:  Totally. That is absolutely true. You know, walking out of

800
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:36,075
Speaker 11:  the store that day, I was like, well, I, I found a good stumper

801
00:47:36,215 --> 00:47:39,795
Speaker 11:  on eBay. Yeah, I, I was, I was sort of hoping that we would go through this

802
00:47:39,795 --> 00:47:43,755
Speaker 11:  process and triumph at the end, but the utter brokenness of the phone revealed

803
00:47:43,755 --> 00:47:47,355
Speaker 11:  a lot more along the way. So yeah, on the one hand it was, it was funny

804
00:47:47,435 --> 00:47:50,795
Speaker 11:  that the end result is the same. Both the Apple store and Jet City

805
00:47:51,145 --> 00:47:54,835
Speaker 11:  were like, this is not a phone that's worth fixing. But as you're, as you

806
00:47:54,835 --> 00:47:58,275
Speaker 11:  say, the journey to get there was was just totally different. Mm.

807
00:47:58,615 --> 00:48:02,475
Speaker 11:  As soon as Apple saw that there was a third party part in their phone,

808
00:48:02,705 --> 00:48:06,115
Speaker 11:  they were like case closed and that was the end of it. Whereas AV

809
00:48:06,565 --> 00:48:10,515
Speaker 11:  found the log files, he opened the phone up, he tested like four different

810
00:48:10,515 --> 00:48:14,355
Speaker 11:  parts. He really worked the problem, which was what I was looking to

811
00:48:14,615 --> 00:48:18,395
Speaker 11:  see. And it drove home. You know, one big argument for independent

812
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:22,155
Speaker 11:  repair shops, which is that they'll repair things that manufacturers never

813
00:48:22,555 --> 00:48:26,435
Speaker 11:  intended to be repaired in the first place. There's one really

814
00:48:26,505 --> 00:48:30,475
Speaker 11:  wild case in point while I was there, while Sava and I were chatting

815
00:48:30,905 --> 00:48:34,595
Speaker 11:  over his shoulder, I noticed this industrial looking device

816
00:48:34,865 --> 00:48:38,715
Speaker 11:  next to his workbench that was shining a bunch of lights on an iPhone

817
00:48:38,905 --> 00:48:42,835
Speaker 11:  that had a totally shattered back glass. And I asked Sava,

818
00:48:43,225 --> 00:48:44,915
Speaker 11:  what is up with that? That's

819
00:48:44,915 --> 00:48:48,835
Speaker 12:  The laser. Oh shit. What is that doing? It's lasering off the adhesive from

820
00:48:48,835 --> 00:48:49,435
Speaker 12:  the backlash.

821
00:48:49,935 --> 00:48:50,435
Speaker 11:  No kidding.

822
00:48:50,745 --> 00:48:54,435
Speaker 12:  Yeah, that's the, you don't wanna stare too long into the white, I'll let

823
00:48:54,435 --> 00:48:54,995
Speaker 12:  you wear this.

824
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,915
Speaker 11:  He handed me a pair of tinted glasses

825
00:48:57,335 --> 00:48:59,635
Speaker 12:  And then you can stare at it while it's lasering.

826
00:49:01,015 --> 00:49:04,795
Speaker 11:  So for most iPhone models, there's no official way to

827
00:49:04,855 --> 00:49:08,755
Speaker 11:  fix that back glass. It's glued to the phone, but that's where indie

828
00:49:08,755 --> 00:49:12,675
Speaker 11:  repair shops are like, okay, challenge accepted, you buy a laser

829
00:49:12,935 --> 00:49:16,755
Speaker 11:  and you zap the phone to loosen the adhesive and then you manually scrape

830
00:49:16,755 --> 00:49:20,715
Speaker 11:  the glass off and install a new plate. And that's just what it

831
00:49:20,715 --> 00:49:24,235
Speaker 11:  takes to repair something in spite of the design of the thing.

832
00:49:24,815 --> 00:49:28,395
Speaker 11:  Did you buy this laser specifically for this kind of repair or does it do

833
00:49:28,395 --> 00:49:28,755
Speaker 11:  other things?

834
00:49:28,975 --> 00:49:29,675
Speaker 12:  No, just for this,

835
00:49:30,045 --> 00:49:33,595
Speaker 2:  First of all that rules, everyone should have a laser in their house that

836
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:34,955
Speaker 2:  just does one job. Yeah,

837
00:49:34,955 --> 00:49:38,795
Speaker 11:  That's a single purpose laser. I have one for my cat and I I want

838
00:49:38,795 --> 00:49:42,595
Speaker 11:  more now. Yeah. So that was really notable. The other notable thing

839
00:49:42,735 --> 00:49:46,675
Speaker 11:  to me about the repairs that I brought in is that

840
00:49:46,895 --> 00:49:50,755
Speaker 11:  as much as I was looking for stumps, they were actually pretty simple in

841
00:49:50,855 --> 00:49:54,675
Speaker 11:  one regard, which is that the parts that we replaced were

842
00:49:54,675 --> 00:49:58,595
Speaker 11:  not programmed by Apple to resist the doing of the

843
00:49:58,595 --> 00:49:58,955
Speaker 11:  repair.

844
00:49:59,535 --> 00:50:01,755
Speaker 2:  Oh. Is this the part where we get to talk about parts pairing? I've been

845
00:50:01,755 --> 00:50:04,995
Speaker 2:  wanting to scream parts pairing ever since You said third party battery like

846
00:50:05,205 --> 00:50:06,475
Speaker 2:  hours ago. Yeah.

847
00:50:06,495 --> 00:50:06,795
Speaker 11:  Is this,

848
00:50:07,025 --> 00:50:08,475
Speaker 2:  This is the parts pairing part of our program.

849
00:50:08,585 --> 00:50:10,515
Speaker 11:  This is the parts pairing part of the story.

850
00:50:10,665 --> 00:50:12,795
Speaker 2:  It's like when we talk about the smart home and we have to get really upset

851
00:50:12,795 --> 00:50:15,755
Speaker 2:  about matter for 15 minutes, like this is the part of the right to repair

852
00:50:15,755 --> 00:50:17,515
Speaker 2:  story where we have to talk about parts pairing.

853
00:50:17,855 --> 00:50:21,755
Speaker 11:  Yes. And I like, I was very naive. I was like, okay, I

854
00:50:21,755 --> 00:50:25,155
Speaker 11:  did a parts pairing story last time. This story isn't gonna be about parts

855
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:28,845
Speaker 11:  pairing, I'm gonna talk about other stuff. But I learned very quickly

856
00:50:29,355 --> 00:50:33,325
Speaker 11:  that you just can't talk about iPhones without talking about

857
00:50:33,325 --> 00:50:37,285
Speaker 11:  parts pairing any repair of just about any part of an iPhone will

858
00:50:37,285 --> 00:50:41,045
Speaker 11:  eventually lead a repair tech to talk about parts pairing. So

859
00:50:41,045 --> 00:50:44,565
Speaker 11:  without doing a whole other segment parts pairing in brief, your phone can

860
00:50:44,565 --> 00:50:48,365
Speaker 11:  basically sabotage your repair. If it figures out that you didn't

861
00:50:48,385 --> 00:50:52,285
Speaker 11:  use Apple parts installed by Apple text, so If you replace the

862
00:50:52,285 --> 00:50:56,045
Speaker 11:  screen, it might lose the true tone feature. If you replace the battery,

863
00:50:56,265 --> 00:51:00,125
Speaker 11:  it might not track its health over time anymore replaced touch ID

864
00:51:00,145 --> 00:51:03,965
Speaker 11:  or face ID components, we'll just fully fail. Again, we've talked a lot

865
00:51:03,965 --> 00:51:07,885
Speaker 11:  about this, but being in a repair shop made me

866
00:51:07,895 --> 00:51:11,805
Speaker 11:  appreciate just how much parts pairing has undermined them over

867
00:51:11,805 --> 00:51:15,205
Speaker 11:  the years. These bugs have been popping up in iPhones

868
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:19,125
Speaker 11:  generation after generation and it's not like Apple announces them to

869
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:23,085
Speaker 11:  everybody. They have to get discovered and shared and it happens when

870
00:51:23,085 --> 00:51:27,045
Speaker 11:  repairs just start going haywire for no reason at all. So just to name

871
00:51:27,185 --> 00:51:30,885
Speaker 11:  one example, a few years back a YouTuber named Hugh Jeffreys

872
00:51:30,885 --> 00:51:34,765
Speaker 11:  noticed something really weird when he replaced the cameras in an iPhone

873
00:51:34,765 --> 00:51:35,085
Speaker 11:  12

874
00:51:35,615 --> 00:51:39,205
Speaker 13:  After changing the camera two functions are now completely unusable.

875
00:51:39,845 --> 00:51:43,485
Speaker 13:  Portrait mode only works for the front camera with the back one only

876
00:51:43,485 --> 00:51:47,325
Speaker 13:  flashing still images and a black screen. You can see panoramas

877
00:51:47,435 --> 00:51:49,885
Speaker 13:  also don't work when using the 0.5 x zoom.

878
00:51:50,215 --> 00:51:54,125
Speaker 11:  There was no warning about non-genuine parts. The new cameras were

879
00:51:54,125 --> 00:51:56,965
Speaker 11:  just flaky, which is a thing Sava noticed. So

880
00:51:57,065 --> 00:52:00,685
Speaker 12:  It mimicked a quality control issue rather than

881
00:52:01,105 --> 00:52:04,845
Speaker 12:  an intentional interference with the functionality on Apple's part. Yeah.

882
00:52:04,905 --> 00:52:08,765
Speaker 12:  And so your immediate gut instinct even as a technician is

883
00:52:08,765 --> 00:52:12,485
Speaker 12:  going to be man, there's no reliable parts for them. With serialization

884
00:52:12,585 --> 00:52:16,405
Speaker 12:  you can actually program failures that are in intermittent and

885
00:52:16,435 --> 00:52:18,045
Speaker 12:  mess with people's heads. Wait,

886
00:52:18,205 --> 00:52:21,965
Speaker 2:  Hang on. How did they know in this process that it wasn't some

887
00:52:21,995 --> 00:52:24,125
Speaker 2:  sketchy part causing the problems here?

888
00:52:24,435 --> 00:52:28,045
Speaker 11:  Well he knew because the YouTuber took the parts straight out of another

889
00:52:28,135 --> 00:52:29,645
Speaker 11:  brand new iPhone 12.

890
00:52:30,025 --> 00:52:31,165
Speaker 2:  Oh, that would do it. Yeah.

891
00:52:31,225 --> 00:52:34,605
Speaker 11:  He actually took two phones right out of the box and swapped their components

892
00:52:34,785 --> 00:52:38,525
Speaker 11:  and both the phones had these issues. So Apple eventually

893
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:42,685
Speaker 11:  fixed that specific bug with a software update, though they

894
00:52:42,735 --> 00:52:46,325
Speaker 11:  added that non-genuine parts warning instead. Of course. And

895
00:52:46,685 --> 00:52:50,445
Speaker 11:  actually just last month, apple did announce some

896
00:52:50,455 --> 00:52:54,445
Speaker 11:  plans to relax some pairing restrictions on used

897
00:52:54,445 --> 00:52:58,285
Speaker 11:  Apple parts. Though it's only on select models of iPhones and

898
00:52:58,285 --> 00:53:00,885
Speaker 11:  there are just a lot of specifics that they haven't talked about. but it

899
00:53:00,885 --> 00:53:04,805
Speaker 11:  does mean in the future you might be able to pull a screen off of

900
00:53:04,825 --> 00:53:08,205
Speaker 11:  one iPhone and drop it in another without any problems. So we'll have to

901
00:53:08,205 --> 00:53:11,725
Speaker 11:  see about that. But even if that happens after market parts

902
00:53:12,025 --> 00:53:15,645
Speaker 11:  are probably still gonna cause problems. And this is the thing,

903
00:53:16,015 --> 00:53:19,685
Speaker 11:  maybe some of those problems will be genuine aftermarket parts

904
00:53:19,935 --> 00:53:23,725
Speaker 11:  don't always work perfectly with the original hardware and you can make

905
00:53:23,765 --> 00:53:27,365
Speaker 11:  a mistake during a repair and that can cause a problem. But the repair

906
00:53:27,415 --> 00:53:31,365
Speaker 11:  techs just feel so gaslit by Apple after this

907
00:53:31,365 --> 00:53:32,405
Speaker 11:  history of bugs.

908
00:53:32,745 --> 00:53:36,685
Speaker 12:  Now there's like this healthy paranoia. Yeah. Where you don't know if that

909
00:53:36,685 --> 00:53:39,685
Speaker 12:  was something else or if it was intentional sabotage.

910
00:53:40,075 --> 00:53:44,005
Speaker 11:  Over the years, the community has found some pretty clever workarounds.

911
00:53:44,135 --> 00:53:48,125
Speaker 11:  There are ways to restore true tone if you're comfortable physically moving

912
00:53:48,255 --> 00:53:52,205
Speaker 11:  microchips around. There are aftermarket home buttons that are explicitly

913
00:53:52,205 --> 00:53:56,085
Speaker 11:  built to get around the phone security checks. OSH can even make

914
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:59,765
Speaker 11:  a third party battery play nice with an iPhone, but it is a process.

915
00:54:00,545 --> 00:54:02,485
Speaker 12:  You see that tool right there? The

916
00:54:03,145 --> 00:54:03,965
Speaker 11:  Red thing with the Yeah,

917
00:54:03,995 --> 00:54:07,925
Speaker 12:  Yeah. That's a welder spot welder. Okay. And so you have to

918
00:54:08,025 --> 00:54:12,005
Speaker 12:  cut the battery electronics from the old battery and

919
00:54:12,005 --> 00:54:15,565
Speaker 12:  then you have a new battery without the electronics. Yeah. And

920
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:19,765
Speaker 12:  you spot weld those two points. Yeah. Back on and

921
00:54:19,765 --> 00:54:23,685
Speaker 12:  then roll 'em like a cigar and then tape it up again and

922
00:54:23,685 --> 00:54:24,365
Speaker 12:  then put it together.

923
00:54:25,185 --> 00:54:29,085
Speaker 11:  The upshot is that chops constantly have this really tough choice

924
00:54:29,105 --> 00:54:32,765
Speaker 11:  to make. Either they have to jump through all of these absurd

925
00:54:32,815 --> 00:54:36,765
Speaker 11:  hoops to outsmart the devices that they're fixing or they have

926
00:54:36,765 --> 00:54:40,485
Speaker 11:  to ask their customers to live with bugs and that

927
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:44,005
Speaker 11:  choice more than anything else. Infuriates

928
00:54:44,305 --> 00:54:44,525
Speaker 11:  Ava,

929
00:54:45,745 --> 00:54:49,645
Speaker 12:  We do better work than Apple. Jet. City. Device Repair does better work

930
00:54:49,645 --> 00:54:53,405
Speaker 12:  than Apple. We've done better work than Apple for a very long time, but

931
00:54:53,515 --> 00:54:57,365
Speaker 12:  because of these limitations sometimes appears as if we do

932
00:54:57,365 --> 00:54:57,805
Speaker 12:  worse work.

933
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:07,285
Speaker 2:  All right. I feel Sasha's pain. I really do. But will you have led me up

934
00:55:07,285 --> 00:55:11,125
Speaker 2:  to what I hope is now the grand finale here, which is our, our good

935
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:15,045
Speaker 2:  friend Rusty, the iPhone 14 that has spent, what was it, some amount of

936
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:16,085
Speaker 2:  time in saltwater?

937
00:55:16,685 --> 00:55:20,605
Speaker 11:  I I actually reached out to the eBay seller after I bought it and it turns

938
00:55:20,605 --> 00:55:23,725
Speaker 11:  out it, they just found it in a bay in Florida.

939
00:55:25,065 --> 00:55:27,725
Speaker 11:  So some time is really putting it lightly.

940
00:55:27,805 --> 00:55:30,765
Speaker 2:  I think somewhere between 10 minutes and two years in saltwater

941
00:55:31,085 --> 00:55:32,765
Speaker 11:  Between 10 minutes and the release of the phone.

942
00:55:34,035 --> 00:55:36,125
Speaker 2:  Love it. So Rusty, what happened with Rusty?

943
00:55:36,825 --> 00:55:40,725
Speaker 11:  So I, you know, I I told you I had really high hopes for Rusty and

944
00:55:40,985 --> 00:55:44,565
Speaker 11:  Ava again, to his credit, was totally happy to open it up and see,

945
00:55:44,985 --> 00:55:45,805
Speaker 11:  but it's

946
00:55:45,805 --> 00:55:47,405
Speaker 12:  Like leaking corrosion.

947
00:55:48,465 --> 00:55:52,245
Speaker 11:  The guts of the phone were just totally coated in this toxic

948
00:55:52,245 --> 00:55:56,085
Speaker 11:  looking white and brown gunk. It, it was disgusting.

949
00:55:56,585 --> 00:55:57,525
Speaker 12:  Oh my god. I can

950
00:55:57,525 --> 00:55:59,805
Speaker 11:  Hear, I mean I can hear the sound that it's making

951
00:56:00,155 --> 00:56:04,085
Speaker 12:  Guys, you wanna see a record breaking that's like a coral reef in there.

952
00:56:04,085 --> 00:56:07,845
Speaker 12:  Yeah. Corrosion phone. There's nothing we can do with it, but I got, I I

953
00:56:07,845 --> 00:56:11,245
Speaker 12:  can share it with the, with the company. They're gonna have fun with it.

954
00:56:11,745 --> 00:56:15,045
Speaker 11:  It was so bad that he posted a photo of it to the company Slack.

955
00:56:15,445 --> 00:56:17,645
Speaker 12:  I was gonna say, can we fix this 14 pro mat?

956
00:56:19,665 --> 00:56:20,925
Speaker 11:  So, so that was Rusty

957
00:56:21,345 --> 00:56:25,045
Speaker 2:  Moment of silence for Rusty. I will say though, huge

958
00:56:25,045 --> 00:56:28,685
Speaker 2:  success on your part in a certain sense that you managed to bring

959
00:56:28,795 --> 00:56:32,685
Speaker 2:  this person a phone that they then shared with the rest

960
00:56:32,705 --> 00:56:36,405
Speaker 2:  of the company. It was so broken, so spectacularly like. Yeah,

961
00:56:36,545 --> 00:56:39,845
Speaker 2:  if the goal was to find interestingly broken phones, like, oh boy did you

962
00:56:39,845 --> 00:56:40,045
Speaker 2:  do it?

963
00:56:40,485 --> 00:56:43,365
Speaker 11:  I knew ensemble, you know, that's making me feel better for spending the

964
00:56:43,365 --> 00:56:46,645
Speaker 11:  amount of money that I spent on a, a, a phone that was never gonna be fixed

965
00:56:46,825 --> 00:56:49,525
Speaker 11:  guy. Yeah. Because I just, I knew that it was destined for something great.

966
00:56:49,745 --> 00:56:53,365
Speaker 2:  It will live on, yeah, rusty lives on at the repair shop, it's probably,

967
00:56:53,475 --> 00:56:57,285
Speaker 2:  he's probably in a, in a frame on a wall somewhere. Just oozing gross.

968
00:56:58,305 --> 00:56:58,845
Speaker 11:  So foul.

969
00:57:00,665 --> 00:57:03,405
Speaker 2:  So what, what do you feel like you learned from this experiment? You went

970
00:57:03,405 --> 00:57:06,965
Speaker 2:  in trying to get kind of a real sort of tangible sense of what the right

971
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:09,085
Speaker 2:  to repair fight is Like what, what do you feel like you learned?

972
00:57:09,585 --> 00:57:13,205
Speaker 11:  So I, I feel like I learned a couple of things. The first thing

973
00:57:13,545 --> 00:57:17,245
Speaker 11:  is, is maybe obvious for people who have spent any time in this

974
00:57:17,245 --> 00:57:21,085
Speaker 11:  world, but as a consumer and an Apple device

975
00:57:21,085 --> 00:57:24,925
Speaker 11:  owner, it was new to me and it's just that Apple is not

976
00:57:24,945 --> 00:57:28,845
Speaker 11:  the authority on its own phones in this context. It's people

977
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:32,405
Speaker 11:  like Sav who are, I've talked to a lot of independent

978
00:57:32,465 --> 00:57:36,205
Speaker 11:  repair techs over the course of this reporting and they have all

979
00:57:36,315 --> 00:57:39,405
Speaker 11:  just put in the time to get to know these devices

980
00:57:40,065 --> 00:57:43,725
Speaker 11:  inside and out. And they literally have to, to understand them

981
00:57:43,725 --> 00:57:47,645
Speaker 11:  better than the Apple geniuses if they wanna do all these repairs that

982
00:57:47,745 --> 00:57:51,645
Speaker 11:  either Apple doesn't care about doing or actively doesn't want them to

983
00:57:51,645 --> 00:57:55,165
Speaker 11:  do. That's the thing that, that sets them apart from

984
00:57:55,465 --> 00:57:59,285
Speaker 11:  the Apple repair internal ecosystem. And that's what right to

985
00:57:59,285 --> 00:58:03,045
Speaker 11:  repair. Advocates are trying so hard through these laws and all these other

986
00:58:03,045 --> 00:58:06,885
Speaker 11:  things to protect. So that kind of turned my thinking around on the

987
00:58:06,885 --> 00:58:10,325
Speaker 11:  sort of internal external repair ecosystem. The

988
00:58:10,325 --> 00:58:13,485
Speaker 2:  Thing that keeps jumping out to me as you talk is there's such a different

989
00:58:13,835 --> 00:58:17,565
Speaker 2:  incentive here, right? Like Apple, even If, you believe Apple

990
00:58:17,565 --> 00:58:21,245
Speaker 2:  would like to fix the things that it sells. You also would like to sell you

991
00:58:21,245 --> 00:58:25,005
Speaker 2:  new things. And so what you get, I think my sense of your Apple store trip

992
00:58:25,005 --> 00:58:28,325
Speaker 2:  is very much that you sort of ran into a script and

993
00:58:28,715 --> 00:58:32,605
Speaker 2:  when you said third party battery or they discovered third party battery

994
00:58:32,905 --> 00:58:36,685
Speaker 2:  or it became obvious that it was water damage, it just immediately is like

995
00:58:36,755 --> 00:58:40,125
Speaker 2:  jump to end, which means we can't repair it. Whereas If, you go to a repair

996
00:58:40,125 --> 00:58:44,005
Speaker 2:  shop, the one and only thing they are there to do is repair

997
00:58:44,005 --> 00:58:47,685
Speaker 2:  it. And so you just have set yourself up in a very different sort of

998
00:58:47,685 --> 00:58:51,165
Speaker 2:  adventure from the very beginning just by the virtue of like who these folks

999
00:58:51,225 --> 00:58:55,045
Speaker 2:  are regardless of their talent and resources and ability. Just

1000
00:58:55,045 --> 00:58:58,965
Speaker 2:  having this other thing where the only thing they are there to do is try

1001
00:58:58,965 --> 00:59:01,685
Speaker 2:  and fix your gadget totally changes the way that they're gonna work with

1002
00:59:01,685 --> 00:59:01,765
Speaker 2:  you.

1003
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:05,525
Speaker 11:  Yeah. That's just their whole deal. The, the more people keep more older

1004
00:59:05,555 --> 00:59:09,405
Speaker 11:  gadgets going for longer, the more that they need to be repaired

1005
00:59:09,545 --> 00:59:13,285
Speaker 11:  and the more those repair shops are in business. So it's like, it's absolutely

1006
00:59:13,605 --> 00:59:16,925
Speaker 11:  a difference in incentive more than anything else. Totally. The other thing

1007
00:59:16,925 --> 00:59:20,005
Speaker 11:  that I just found funny and weird is just how

1008
00:59:20,475 --> 00:59:24,365
Speaker 11:  adversarial a relationship Apple has with these independent

1009
00:59:24,505 --> 00:59:27,965
Speaker 11:  repair shops, given what they're actually doing. Like you would think that

1010
00:59:27,965 --> 00:59:31,925
Speaker 11:  Apple was battling these super intense hackers who are trying to take the

1011
00:59:31,925 --> 00:59:35,405
Speaker 11:  company down based on the way that they're acting and all of these, these

1012
00:59:35,515 --> 00:59:39,045
Speaker 11:  bugs that they're putting into the phones and these repair techs are not,

1013
00:59:39,625 --> 00:59:43,405
Speaker 11:  not hackers. I mean you, you can look at what they're doing with these

1014
00:59:43,965 --> 00:59:47,365
Speaker 11:  batteries and their touch ID buttons to get around everything that Apple

1015
00:59:47,425 --> 00:59:51,285
Speaker 11:  is doing. Like they're, they're really scrappy people, but they're not trying

1016
00:59:51,285 --> 00:59:54,765
Speaker 11:  to destroy the company. They're just trying to fix the company's

1017
00:59:54,805 --> 00:59:58,045
Speaker 11:  products. They're literally just like, we're gonna fix your phones,

1018
00:59:58,825 --> 01:00:02,365
Speaker 11:  try to stop us. And I think that is a very

1019
01:00:02,435 --> 01:00:05,645
Speaker 11:  strange group of people to pick such an intense fight with.

1020
01:02:57,445 --> 01:03:00,365
Speaker 2:  15 Pro. We'd love to hear your thoughts since this has confused me for a

1021
01:03:00,365 --> 01:03:04,165
Speaker 2:  while. Unbelievable question. Love it very much. And this is actually, as

1022
01:03:04,165 --> 01:03:08,045
Speaker 2:  I've been reviewing the new iPads, kind of the main question I've been

1023
01:03:08,045 --> 01:03:11,925
Speaker 2:  thinking about the short version of both iPad reviews is that they're

1024
01:03:12,125 --> 01:03:15,965
Speaker 2:  excellent iPads, right? The iPad Pro is thin and

1025
01:03:15,975 --> 01:03:19,965
Speaker 2:  light and just lovely to hold in a way that it's been a long time since

1026
01:03:19,965 --> 01:03:23,845
Speaker 2:  an iPad has felt like that to me. The air is everything you would want

1027
01:03:23,845 --> 01:03:27,565
Speaker 2:  it to be. It's last year's pro in last year's air's body. The

1028
01:03:27,565 --> 01:03:30,205
Speaker 2:  screen's very good, the battery's very good, the processor is very good.

1029
01:03:30,205 --> 01:03:33,565
Speaker 2:  It gets the new pencil. It doesn't have a function row on the keyboard like

1030
01:03:33,565 --> 01:03:37,085
Speaker 2:  the new pro does, but it's a very good iPad. All of the iPads are very good

1031
01:03:37,175 --> 01:03:41,165
Speaker 2:  iPads, right? And so I think the question is really what is the

1032
01:03:41,395 --> 01:03:44,805
Speaker 2:  iPad for? And I think when you ask the question why do some people think

1033
01:03:44,805 --> 01:03:48,605
Speaker 2:  the iPad should be a Macbook replacement, I think it comes down to making

1034
01:03:48,685 --> 01:03:52,405
Speaker 2:  a device that is good for everything is really hard. It might be

1035
01:03:52,405 --> 01:03:56,125
Speaker 2:  impossible, but it's really, really, really hard. And if

1036
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:59,445
Speaker 2:  you're Apple, I think one way to think about it is that Apple has had a bunch

1037
01:03:59,445 --> 01:04:03,285
Speaker 2:  of very versatile but also sort of focused devices

1038
01:04:03,435 --> 01:04:06,725
Speaker 2:  over time. Like the, the story of the Mac is easy, right? You can do lots

1039
01:04:06,725 --> 01:04:10,165
Speaker 2:  of things on the Mac, but it is fundamentally a device for doing work. And

1040
01:04:10,165 --> 01:04:13,765
Speaker 2:  you can define work as broadly as you want, but it is, it is a

1041
01:04:14,015 --> 01:04:17,525
Speaker 2:  productive creative device. It's a device for doing things.

1042
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:21,605
Speaker 2:  The Apple Watch is a device that can do lots of things, but it has increasingly

1043
01:04:21,605 --> 01:04:25,325
Speaker 2:  over time become a device about fitness and health. AirPods headphones, that

1044
01:04:25,325 --> 01:04:29,205
Speaker 2:  one's easy, right? The iPhone is the exception. It is a

1045
01:04:29,205 --> 01:04:32,685
Speaker 2:  device that is fundamentally all things to all people.

1046
01:04:33,105 --> 01:04:36,645
Speaker 2:  And as a result, this is, I mean this is why smartphones have become so dominant,

1047
01:04:36,735 --> 01:04:40,725
Speaker 2:  right? They are all things to all people and thus they are the

1048
01:04:40,725 --> 01:04:44,605
Speaker 2:  most important device that almost everyone owns at this point. That's a very

1049
01:04:44,635 --> 01:04:48,125
Speaker 2:  hard thing to replicate if you're Apple or if you're anyone,

1050
01:04:48,545 --> 01:04:52,405
Speaker 2:  the smartphone won like it just did. And so trying to do something

1051
01:04:52,405 --> 01:04:56,045
Speaker 2:  that does all the same things a smartphone does that is as varied and

1052
01:04:56,055 --> 01:05:00,005
Speaker 2:  broad and able to accomplish so many different goals all in one package

1053
01:05:00,395 --> 01:05:04,245
Speaker 2:  just puts you in competition with the smartphone. It's a bad idea. Most people

1054
01:05:04,245 --> 01:05:08,045
Speaker 2:  don't do it. What we're seeing actually is that even things like

1055
01:05:08,305 --> 01:05:11,485
Speaker 2:  AI devices that try to do lots of things fail because they're worse than

1056
01:05:11,485 --> 01:05:15,285
Speaker 2:  your smartphone. And instead what's cool and what's working is devices

1057
01:05:15,315 --> 01:05:19,045
Speaker 2:  that take one feature of the iPhone and do it better. There's a

1058
01:05:19,145 --> 01:05:22,605
Speaker 2:  bit of a resurgence happening in dedicated cameras for instance, because

1059
01:05:22,985 --> 01:05:26,725
Speaker 2:  you get more control and you get better images. But if your camera was like

1060
01:05:26,755 --> 01:05:30,285
Speaker 2:  also trying to order you Ubers, that wouldn't make any sense. So what you're

1061
01:05:30,285 --> 01:05:34,045
Speaker 2:  seeing, I think in the best case here is companies that say, okay, we're

1062
01:05:34,045 --> 01:05:37,725
Speaker 2:  going to cleave off part of what the iPhone

1063
01:05:37,795 --> 01:05:41,605
Speaker 2:  does or a smartphone does in general and try to do it better, right? So

1064
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:45,485
Speaker 2:  they're taking in many cases, smartphone chips, they can run smartphone apps,

1065
01:05:45,795 --> 01:05:49,645
Speaker 2:  they can do things that you do on a smartphone, on a touchscreen in similar

1066
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:52,525
Speaker 2:  ways that you do them on a smartphone, but you can just do more and you can

1067
01:05:52,525 --> 01:05:56,285
Speaker 2:  do them dedicated. The iPad has always been the opposite.

1068
01:05:56,675 --> 01:06:00,605
Speaker 2:  It's trying to be incredibly versatile. It's trying to be

1069
01:06:00,725 --> 01:06:04,645
Speaker 2:  a jack of all trades. It's trying to be all things to all people. And I've

1070
01:06:04,645 --> 01:06:08,485
Speaker 2:  come to think of it like this over time. Apple basically sees

1071
01:06:08,885 --> 01:06:12,725
Speaker 2:  a core set of what you might call iPad things, right? And

1072
01:06:12,725 --> 01:06:16,605
Speaker 2:  that's playing games, that's watching TV and movies,

1073
01:06:17,145 --> 01:06:20,485
Speaker 2:  that's checking your email and browsing the web. This sort of basic

1074
01:06:21,025 --> 01:06:25,005
Speaker 2:  simple use case stuff that people have always done on their iPads, the

1075
01:06:25,005 --> 01:06:27,725
Speaker 2:  same kinds of things that even like Steve Jobs is talking about in the very

1076
01:06:27,725 --> 01:06:31,605
Speaker 2:  first iPad introduction, it's a device for sitting on the couch

1077
01:06:32,165 --> 01:06:36,005
Speaker 2:  casually using a computer. That's cool, that has been

1078
01:06:36,235 --> 01:06:40,165
Speaker 2:  very good on an iPad for a very long time. It's also true that most of those

1079
01:06:40,165 --> 01:06:44,085
Speaker 2:  things are almost as good and in some cases better on your

1080
01:06:44,085 --> 01:06:47,205
Speaker 2:  phone, which is device you already own. It's a device you have to buy before

1081
01:06:47,205 --> 01:06:50,965
Speaker 2:  you buy an iPad. And it's a device that is almost

1082
01:06:51,265 --> 01:06:55,245
Speaker 2:  in every case, more likely to be close to you than your iPad. So what

1083
01:06:55,245 --> 01:06:58,805
Speaker 2:  you have essentially is an iPad is now more work for slightly more benefit

1084
01:06:58,805 --> 01:07:01,205
Speaker 2:  because you have to go get it, you have to keep it charged, it has to be

1085
01:07:01,205 --> 01:07:04,445
Speaker 2:  updated, all this stuff. Whereas I think a lot of people just say, well,

1086
01:07:04,445 --> 01:07:07,205
Speaker 2:  would I do any of that? I have my phone and I already do all that stuff to

1087
01:07:07,205 --> 01:07:10,645
Speaker 2:  have my phone work. So what Apple has been doing over the last several years

1088
01:07:10,945 --> 01:07:14,845
Speaker 2:  is basically adding bits and pieces of functionality that you can't

1089
01:07:14,845 --> 01:07:18,765
Speaker 2:  do on the iPhone in the hopes that not all of them will appeal

1090
01:07:18,825 --> 01:07:22,765
Speaker 2:  to you specifically, but maybe one of them will, right? So this year

1091
01:07:22,765 --> 01:07:26,685
Speaker 2:  you have things like the Pencil Pro, which has a new gesture

1092
01:07:26,805 --> 01:07:30,565
Speaker 2:  called the barrel roll, which basically lets you preview the way that your

1093
01:07:30,565 --> 01:07:34,365
Speaker 2:  brush tip is gonna look on the screen as you move it around and it lets you

1094
01:07:34,435 --> 01:07:37,645
Speaker 2:  turn the brush as you're painting. This is the kind of thing that if you're

1095
01:07:37,645 --> 01:07:39,965
Speaker 2:  hearing that and it doesn't mean anything to you, that's fine, it's not for

1096
01:07:39,965 --> 01:07:43,565
Speaker 2:  you. But there are a lot of people for whom that gives them a level of control

1097
01:07:43,775 --> 01:07:47,405
Speaker 2:  doing artistic work that is really powerful and really important. That's

1098
01:07:47,405 --> 01:07:51,085
Speaker 2:  not how you get giant swaths of new people to use the iPad.

1099
01:07:51,315 --> 01:07:55,045
Speaker 2:  It's not a mainstream new use case, but it is a thing, right? And

1100
01:07:55,335 --> 01:07:59,205
Speaker 2:  Apple, I think believes that over time with enough power and enough work

1101
01:07:59,265 --> 01:08:03,205
Speaker 2:  and maybe enough AI stuff, which is what's coming at WW DC,

1102
01:08:03,505 --> 01:08:07,365
Speaker 2:  and I think we're gonna see Apple make some big swings at new

1103
01:08:07,765 --> 01:08:11,725
Speaker 2:  features that only work on these super powerful touch enabled, ultra portable

1104
01:08:11,725 --> 01:08:15,245
Speaker 2:  devices that make it more compelling. And so rather than have

1105
01:08:15,705 --> 01:08:19,445
Speaker 2:  one giant mainstream use case that appeals to everyone on earth, it wants

1106
01:08:19,445 --> 01:08:23,205
Speaker 2:  to have a million different little ones covering sort of every niche at a

1107
01:08:23,205 --> 01:08:26,365
Speaker 2:  time and hope that that adds up to

1108
01:08:26,595 --> 01:08:29,965
Speaker 2:  everybody. So how does this come back to the MacBook question? I think the

1109
01:08:29,965 --> 01:08:33,885
Speaker 2:  reason people talk about it as a laptop is because it is one obvious place

1110
01:08:34,225 --> 01:08:38,125
Speaker 2:  for the iPad to go, right? You look at it, it's a 13 inch screen, I

1111
01:08:38,125 --> 01:08:41,925
Speaker 2:  can drop it into my keyboard, it has a track pad, it runs a lot of the same

1112
01:08:41,925 --> 01:08:45,845
Speaker 2:  apps that are on my MacBook. So it's natural to say, well, okay, one thing

1113
01:08:45,845 --> 01:08:49,765
Speaker 2:  this could do that it doesn't is be more like my MacBook. I actually have

1114
01:08:49,765 --> 01:08:53,565
Speaker 2:  come to believe that that's the wrong answer, or at least it's the least

1115
01:08:53,885 --> 01:08:57,365
Speaker 2:  interesting answer. I think Apple's strategy of trying to find

1116
01:08:57,965 --> 01:09:01,845
Speaker 2:  a million small things that add up to one big thing is actually

1117
01:09:01,845 --> 01:09:05,605
Speaker 2:  more exciting and means ultimately that the iPad can be a device that isn't

1118
01:09:05,605 --> 01:09:08,565
Speaker 2:  just a touchscreen MacBook. I also think they should put a touchscreen on

1119
01:09:08,565 --> 01:09:11,645
Speaker 2:  the MacBook, but that's what the touchscreen MacBook should be. It should

1120
01:09:11,645 --> 01:09:15,405
Speaker 2:  be a MacBook with a touchscreen, not an iPad that runs Mac os. I just don't

1121
01:09:15,405 --> 01:09:18,605
Speaker 2:  think that's the right strategy. It's at least not the most interesting strategy,

1122
01:09:19,185 --> 01:09:23,045
Speaker 2:  but we're in this position now where if you're looking at the iPad and you're

1123
01:09:23,045 --> 01:09:26,325
Speaker 2:  saying, okay, this does a lot of stuff, but what? What would push it over

1124
01:09:26,325 --> 01:09:30,205
Speaker 2:  the edge? What would make it an essential important game

1125
01:09:30,485 --> 01:09:34,325
Speaker 2:  changing? Bring it with me everywhere, no matter what kind of device work

1126
01:09:34,465 --> 01:09:38,445
Speaker 2:  is one obvious answer to that. That's why you see for creative people, it

1127
01:09:38,445 --> 01:09:42,205
Speaker 2:  very much is that kind of tool. If, you need to draw on a screen. The iPad

1128
01:09:42,205 --> 01:09:44,405
Speaker 2:  is the best thing that exists. You can't replicate that on your phone, you

1129
01:09:44,405 --> 01:09:48,125
Speaker 2:  can't replicate that on your MacBook. You need an iPad for that. And we're

1130
01:09:48,165 --> 01:09:51,765
Speaker 2:  starting to see that for some filmmaking stuff that's happening. People are

1131
01:09:51,765 --> 01:09:55,245
Speaker 2:  doing interesting monitoring and editing work on their iPads. It's a cool

1132
01:09:55,355 --> 01:09:59,285
Speaker 2:  tool for photography, for editing photos, bits and pieces like

1133
01:09:59,345 --> 01:10:03,085
Speaker 2:  I'm saying. But If, you then throw in, you know, this capital W work

1134
01:10:03,255 --> 01:10:07,125
Speaker 2:  thing, whatever that means to people. Whether it's, I want to have

1135
01:10:07,165 --> 01:10:10,925
Speaker 2:  a desktop browser so that I can use all my browser extensions and Google

1136
01:10:11,035 --> 01:10:14,525
Speaker 2:  Docs will be better, or I want full bore, full power

1137
01:10:14,735 --> 01:10:17,925
Speaker 2:  Excel running on this thing so that I don't have to go back to my computer.

1138
01:10:18,225 --> 01:10:21,845
Speaker 2:  Or it means I want to use the accounting software that I haven't

1139
01:10:22,075 --> 01:10:25,965
Speaker 2:  updated in 10 years but desperately need in order to do my job.

1140
01:10:26,185 --> 01:10:30,005
Speaker 2:  If, you pull all of that stuff down to the iPad, I think it changes the iPad,

1141
01:10:30,425 --> 01:10:34,245
Speaker 2:  but it also makes it more essential to some people in a certain

1142
01:10:34,245 --> 01:10:38,165
Speaker 2:  way. And so I think that is why people have been pushing Apple to turn it

1143
01:10:38,165 --> 01:10:41,685
Speaker 2:  into like a laptop, is that it would make it something

1144
01:10:41,685 --> 01:10:45,605
Speaker 2:  everybody needs, which I actually don't think is right. Again, because laptops

1145
01:10:45,605 --> 01:10:49,085
Speaker 2:  exist and MacBooks in particular are very good laptops. And so

1146
01:10:49,515 --> 01:10:53,485
Speaker 2:  that is just a tricky thing for Apple to get right. Again, if

1147
01:10:53,485 --> 01:10:57,445
Speaker 2:  it wants to be this one all things to all people device,

1148
01:10:57,915 --> 01:11:00,925
Speaker 2:  it's gonna have to do a lot of that eventually. And I think Apple is sort

1149
01:11:00,925 --> 01:11:04,605
Speaker 2:  of hoping that work apps will get better before the

1150
01:11:04,675 --> 01:11:08,565
Speaker 2:  iPad has to worry about all of that old compatibility stuff. But I'm not

1151
01:11:08,565 --> 01:11:12,365
Speaker 2:  convinced that's gonna be true. So if I'm Apple, I'm saying right now

1152
01:11:12,795 --> 01:11:16,085
Speaker 2:  that the versatility of the iPad is the point and this is the thing that

1153
01:11:16,085 --> 01:11:18,485
Speaker 2:  you hear from people at Apple. It's a thing that I've heard from people at

1154
01:11:18,485 --> 01:11:22,005
Speaker 2:  Apple. The versatility is the point. They don't want this thing to be

1155
01:11:22,365 --> 01:11:25,925
Speaker 2:  a device for anything. They want it to be a device for everything that everyone

1156
01:11:25,945 --> 01:11:29,885
Speaker 2:  has a different subset of use cases for and that that is what makes it special.

1157
01:11:30,315 --> 01:11:34,165
Speaker 2:  That is an incredibly hard thing to do. I think the Apple Watch

1158
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:37,765
Speaker 2:  is probably the most interesting comparison there by the way, because for

1159
01:11:37,805 --> 01:11:40,765
Speaker 2:  a time that was the pitch for the Apple Watch too, that it was, it was gonna

1160
01:11:40,765 --> 01:11:44,565
Speaker 2:  do all the things your iPhone did, but in a better, more accessible way.

1161
01:11:44,825 --> 01:11:48,365
Speaker 2:  The iPad is a pretty similar case and what we discovered with the watch is

1162
01:11:48,365 --> 01:11:52,085
Speaker 2:  that actually my phone's very good, but the watch does this subset of other

1163
01:11:52,085 --> 01:11:56,005
Speaker 2:  things very well that compliment that it does health and

1164
01:11:56,005 --> 01:11:59,805
Speaker 2:  fitness stuff really well. And it's a very simple controller and I can use

1165
01:11:59,835 --> 01:12:02,925
Speaker 2:  Siri. And so you're seeing Apple bet on those things more and more on the

1166
01:12:02,925 --> 01:12:06,805
Speaker 2:  watch over time, whereas on the iPad it's kind of still stuck

1167
01:12:06,805 --> 01:12:10,285
Speaker 2:  trying to be all things to all people. You can focus on the pencil and that's

1168
01:12:10,285 --> 01:12:13,165
Speaker 2:  great, but the pencil market I think is much smaller than the health and

1169
01:12:13,165 --> 01:12:17,085
Speaker 2:  fitness market. Same goes for some of the like ultra

1170
01:12:17,175 --> 01:12:20,805
Speaker 2:  performant apps that you're starting to see, whether it's like architects

1171
01:12:20,805 --> 01:12:24,045
Speaker 2:  or 3D games or augmented reality. I think all of that stuff on tablets is

1172
01:12:24,045 --> 01:12:28,005
Speaker 2:  fairly niche. So what Apple needs is either one big giant use

1173
01:12:28,005 --> 01:12:31,805
Speaker 2:  case and maybe it is laptop replacement or just

1174
01:12:32,075 --> 01:12:36,045
Speaker 2:  countless more of these little tiny niches that all eventually give

1175
01:12:36,045 --> 01:12:39,965
Speaker 2:  everybody a reason to need an iPad even though it's not the same one. That's

1176
01:12:39,965 --> 01:12:43,925
Speaker 2:  a hard, hard, hard game to play and it's a hard list

1177
01:12:44,025 --> 01:12:47,245
Speaker 2:  of tasks to finish, but I kind of hope that's what Apple keeps doing because

1178
01:12:47,245 --> 01:12:51,085
Speaker 2:  that to me is the most interesting possible future of the iPad. That said,

1179
01:12:51,165 --> 01:12:54,725
Speaker 2:  I do wish Google Docs work better, so just give me that and then I'll probably

1180
01:12:54,725 --> 01:12:55,485
Speaker 2:  need an iPad too.

1181
