00:00:03,145 --> 00:00:07,115
Speaker 1:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of like the fifth

3
00:00:07,255 --> 00:00:11,155
Speaker 1:  row of apps on your smart tv. I'm your friend David Pierce, and I'm sitting

4
00:00:11,155 --> 00:00:15,075
Speaker 1:  here reorganizing my Roku. I end up doing this like once a year or

5
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:18,555
Speaker 1:  so, usually, actually it's around March Madness when I go to download

6
00:00:19,175 --> 00:00:22,835
Speaker 1:  the NCAA March Madness app so that I can watch college basketball

7
00:00:23,265 --> 00:00:27,035
Speaker 1:  only to discover that. In this case, I have 86

8
00:00:27,045 --> 00:00:30,755
Speaker 1:  items on my Roku, and a bunch of them are things that I've never heard of

9
00:00:30,755 --> 00:00:33,875
Speaker 1:  before. Like I have a freebie app. I don't think freebie exists anymore.

10
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:38,435
Speaker 1:  I have one called Fum, which is just awesome with an F at the

11
00:00:38,435 --> 00:00:41,595
Speaker 1:  beginning. What is that? I have an app that's called Purple.

12
00:00:42,745 --> 00:00:46,315
Speaker 1:  There's a thing here for the Food Network. Go and

13
00:00:46,475 --> 00:00:50,235
Speaker 1:  HGTV go. I'm pretty sure those are not a thing. I have a dealer No Deal app

14
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:54,355
Speaker 1:  on my Roku y basically, I assume my smart TV

15
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:58,315
Speaker 1:  is like most people's, where my top few rows are, like the

16
00:00:58,315 --> 00:01:02,235
Speaker 1:  apps I actually use, and then the rest just becomes chaos. And so every once

17
00:01:02,235 --> 00:01:06,155
Speaker 1:  in a while I come in and I clean up the chaos. That is not what we're

18
00:01:06,155 --> 00:01:09,235
Speaker 1:  here to talk about today. This is my lot in life, and hopefully it's not

19
00:01:09,245 --> 00:01:13,195
Speaker 1:  yours. What we're gonna do on the show today is the annual Vergecast Streaming

20
00:01:13,195 --> 00:01:16,875
Speaker 1:  Draft. Once a year, we like to get together and as a way of kind of taking

21
00:01:16,885 --> 00:01:20,835
Speaker 1:  stock of the streaming industry, we do a draft. We see who

22
00:01:20,855 --> 00:01:24,755
Speaker 1:  can put together the best collection of streaming services, which ones are

23
00:01:24,755 --> 00:01:27,915
Speaker 1:  gonna succeed, which ones are gonna fail completely, which ones will be here,

24
00:01:27,915 --> 00:01:31,355
Speaker 1:  which ones won't be here, who's gonna win, who's gonna lose? We're gonna

25
00:01:31,355 --> 00:01:35,275
Speaker 1:  make a lot of bets about the next 12 months in streaming. All on this

26
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:39,155
Speaker 1:  episode. All that is coming up in just a second. But first, a, a

27
00:01:39,155 --> 00:01:43,075
Speaker 1:  quick request for you. So The Vergecast is nominated for a Webby award, which

28
00:01:43,205 --> 00:01:46,875
Speaker 1:  means a lot to us. We've, we've been nominated for this in the past, and

29
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:50,395
Speaker 1:  the reason we care a lot about this award is because it's voted on by you.

30
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:54,435
Speaker 1:  This is an award that you can give to us if you so choose. And

34
00:02:04,955 --> 00:02:08,195
Speaker 1:  a bunch of really good tech podcasts out there right now, but I really wanna

35
00:02:08,215 --> 00:02:12,035
Speaker 1:  win. We, we would really, really like to have the Webby. It's this cool like

Speaker 1:  springy award thing, and it just means a lot to us. So if you're willing,

38
00:02:19,435 --> 00:02:22,995
Speaker 1:  delete. I have like three Hallmark logos on here for some reason, so I'm

39
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:25,955
Speaker 1:  gonna fix that. Then we're gonna get to it. This is The Vergecast. We'll

40
00:02:25,955 --> 00:02:26,275
Speaker 1:  be right back.

41
00:04:18,115 --> 00:04:21,925
Speaker 1:  with the Alex Kranz saga, which means you, you

42
00:04:21,925 --> 00:04:25,845
Speaker 1:  either get to or are saddled with Alex's picks from last year, and

43
00:04:25,845 --> 00:04:29,725
Speaker 1:  then we're gonna go forward. So, congratulations and I'm

44
00:04:29,725 --> 00:04:33,645
Speaker 1:  sorry and welcome. I'm gonna do my best to honor the chaos of her

45
00:04:33,655 --> 00:04:37,405
Speaker 1:  picks and bring that energy into 2025. They were truly chaotic.

46
00:04:37,785 --> 00:04:39,245
Speaker 1:  So just to remind everybody how this works,

47
00:04:40,825 --> 00:04:44,365
Speaker 1:  we have, we have made it slightly more complicated every year, and I'm very

48
00:04:44,365 --> 00:04:47,205
Speaker 1:  proud of that fact. But basically what's going to happen is we're gonna decide

49
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:51,165
Speaker 1:  first who won last year's streaming draft. I'm gonna read out what

50
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:55,045
Speaker 1:  we all picked. We're gonna decide who won. This is based

51
00:04:55,065 --> 00:04:59,005
Speaker 1:  on vibes, if we're being honest with each other. I looked up like,

52
00:04:59,005 --> 00:05:02,365
Speaker 1:  can you find a report card? And it turns out Eli picked Sony Bravia Corps

53
00:05:02,805 --> 00:05:05,685
Speaker 1:  and Billboard Pro does not spend a lot of time litigating the success of

54
00:05:05,715 --> 00:05:09,005
Speaker 1:  Sony Bravia Corps. So we're just gonna read 'em all aloud. There's no need

55
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:12,885
Speaker 1:  to litigate it, David. It's the winner. Sure. So it's,

56
00:05:12,885 --> 00:05:16,085
Speaker 1:  it's so obvious you don't talk about it. Yeah, I mean, it's, It is, It is

57
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:19,805
Speaker 1:  the air we breathe, and then we're gonna go through and we're each gonna

58
00:05:19,855 --> 00:05:23,725
Speaker 1:  draft into, we have seven categories. So there's, I,

59
00:05:23,725 --> 00:05:26,445
Speaker 1:  I'll read the categories in a minute again so everybody can remember, but

60
00:05:26,445 --> 00:05:30,245
Speaker 1:  there's Cheap awards, 4K Live Niche, Wild Card,

61
00:05:30,265 --> 00:05:33,445
Speaker 1:  and a new one this year, which is content. I'll explain all of those

62
00:05:34,115 --> 00:05:36,925
Speaker 1:  once we order the draft. But the first thing we have to do here is decide

63
00:05:36,925 --> 00:05:40,125
Speaker 1:  who gets to go first. Each service can only be picked once

64
00:05:40,915 --> 00:05:43,925
Speaker 1:  it's a draft. This is how we do it. So last year,

65
00:05:44,835 --> 00:05:48,665
Speaker 1:  NELI, you picked TikTok, the Disney bundle,

66
00:05:49,495 --> 00:05:53,265
Speaker 1:  Sony Braco, yes. YouTube TV with Sunday Ticket

67
00:05:53,955 --> 00:05:57,725
Speaker 1:  Motor Trends tv and Max. I'm

68
00:05:57,725 --> 00:06:01,285
Speaker 1:  obviously the winner. I wanna be very clear, honestly, are we sh

69
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,485
Speaker 1:  that's a dominant performance in the draft.

70
00:06:03,485 --> 00:06:07,245
Speaker 8:  Can I tell you something? Sony Braco is not even named Braco anymore.

71
00:06:07,355 --> 00:06:10,645
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I don't even think it was named Braco when you picked it, which,

72
00:06:12,445 --> 00:06:15,285
Speaker 8:  whatever It is. I was looking up the FAQ for this thing. They can't even

73
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:17,285
Speaker 8:  explain what It is or how it works.

74
00:06:17,705 --> 00:06:21,645
Speaker 1:  That's true. And that's why it's like explaining the internet, right? It's

75
00:06:21,645 --> 00:06:25,045
Speaker 1:  just there when you buy a Sony tv. Also, I think MotorTrend TV is dead.

76
00:06:25,605 --> 00:06:29,485
Speaker 1:  Okay. So I'm not, look, I'm just saying on, on its face.

77
00:06:30,365 --> 00:06:34,015
Speaker 1:  This is a dominant performance with some, with some risks

78
00:06:34,475 --> 00:06:35,695
Speaker 1:  thrown in the, in the mix.

79
00:06:36,155 --> 00:06:40,135
Speaker 8:  You know, TikTok, you know, big, big winner there that really pulled

80
00:06:40,135 --> 00:06:44,055
Speaker 8:  through. I i you're, you're maybe cashing out right on

81
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:44,455
Speaker 8:  time there.

82
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:48,055
Speaker 1:  There's a real chance that most of my picks don't exist by the end of this

83
00:06:48,055 --> 00:06:51,455
Speaker 1:  conversation. We literally had to push recording this episode a week

84
00:06:51,835 --> 00:06:55,175
Speaker 1:  to see if TikTok would still be here. This is, this is how tenuous things

85
00:06:55,175 --> 00:06:59,055
Speaker 1:  are. But anyway, so those are ne last picks. Alex's picks, which Jake

86
00:06:59,075 --> 00:07:03,015
Speaker 1:  are now your legacy. Welcome. Were Peacock, Hulu,

87
00:07:03,085 --> 00:07:06,775
Speaker 1:  Netflix, the Channels app, crunchy Roll,

88
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:07,895
Speaker 1:  and Paramount Plus

89
00:07:08,535 --> 00:07:11,935
Speaker 8:  I, to be honest, I did not know how to figure out what the Channels app was.

90
00:07:12,135 --> 00:07:13,495
Speaker 8:  I just have a list that says channels.

91
00:07:13,775 --> 00:07:17,055
Speaker 1:  Channels is, I would say like Imagine

92
00:07:17,995 --> 00:07:18,415
Speaker 1:  Piracy.

93
00:07:19,365 --> 00:07:20,055
Speaker 8:  Okay. But

94
00:07:20,055 --> 00:07:23,815
Speaker 1:  Like less. Does that make sense? Channels is a good way. You can get all

95
00:07:23,815 --> 00:07:26,495
Speaker 1:  the fast channels. That's good. You can, you can get a bunch of, you can,

96
00:07:26,495 --> 00:07:29,775
Speaker 1:  you can sort of curate your own TiVo situation, but it's more complic. Yeah.

97
00:07:29,895 --> 00:07:32,295
Speaker 1:  You have an antenna, you want channels to run all of that for

98
00:07:32,295 --> 00:07:35,215
Speaker 8:  You. Well, lemme say something. Sounds like the two of you are pretty supportive

99
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:37,575
Speaker 8:  of channels as a pick. So I'm feel pretty good about that. It

100
00:07:37,575 --> 00:07:39,255
Speaker 1:  Was, it was, it was a good one. It was a good Alex for

101
00:07:39,255 --> 00:07:43,215
Speaker 8:  Sure. And lemme say this, for, for Peacock, not only did they announce

102
00:07:43,455 --> 00:07:46,895
Speaker 8:  a new season of Poker Face, but it didn't stream last year, but it will

103
00:07:47,765 --> 00:07:51,175
Speaker 8:  this year. This is true. And not only

104
00:07:51,715 --> 00:07:53,855
Speaker 8:  are there Olympics, they'll have it eventually.

105
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:57,055
Speaker 1:  If NBC has its way, there will be Olympics every year for the rest of our

106
00:07:57,055 --> 00:07:57,255
Speaker 1:  lives.

107
00:07:58,005 --> 00:08:01,975
Speaker 8:  Yeah. But, but I I, I'm not sure how big

108
00:08:01,975 --> 00:08:04,735
Speaker 8:  that's been for them. So I I I think there's some ups and downs here. Hulu

109
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:07,455
Speaker 8:  I think is rock solid. Netflix, we had

110
00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:11,055
Speaker 8:  what, last year we got a a, a season of Stranger Things season.

111
00:08:11,735 --> 00:08:11,855
Speaker 1:  Squid

112
00:08:11,855 --> 00:08:15,615
Speaker 8:  Game. I mean, yeah. That, that's just showing how

113
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:18,695
Speaker 8:  rock solid their service is. You know, Kres did pretty good.

114
00:08:18,845 --> 00:08:22,015
Speaker 1:  Yeah, this is good. Okay. And then my picks were

115
00:08:22,445 --> 00:08:26,215
Speaker 1:  YouTube, just base YouTube, apple

116
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:30,255
Speaker 1:  TV plus AKA, the severance pick Tubi, which

117
00:08:30,255 --> 00:08:34,095
Speaker 1:  streamed the Super Bowl. Just saying Prime video, the

118
00:08:34,095 --> 00:08:37,815
Speaker 1:  Criterion Channel and Instagram reels. And just really quick, I'm going to

119
00:08:37,815 --> 00:08:41,695
Speaker 1:  say I didn't win because I picked Instagram reels. So I just immediately,

120
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:44,935
Speaker 1:  I'm not allowed to win because I picked Instagram reels. You have the real

121
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:49,095
Speaker 1:  like discount bundle here. I do. Right? YouTube. YouTube with ads.

122
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:52,735
Speaker 1:  Just like plain old YouTube with ads. Yeah, apple TV plus, which you get,

123
00:08:52,795 --> 00:08:56,685
Speaker 1:  if you sneeze loudly enough in an Uber Tubi, which

124
00:08:56,685 --> 00:09:00,125
Speaker 1:  is free Prime video, which is free,

125
00:09:00,315 --> 00:09:03,725
Speaker 1:  essentially free. Yeah. Criterion is good, right? You got, you got the one

126
00:09:03,725 --> 00:09:07,525
Speaker 1:  gesture in Instagram reels, which is just fully temu TikTok

127
00:09:07,735 --> 00:09:10,725
Speaker 1:  knock off TikTok. Yeah. Yeah. But

128
00:09:10,755 --> 00:09:11,645
Speaker 8:  It's not banned.

129
00:09:12,275 --> 00:09:13,645
Speaker 1:  It's, it, It is here to stay

130
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:16,405
Speaker 8:  And it's not going to be banned theoretically.

131
00:09:16,785 --> 00:09:20,085
Speaker 1:  So there, there is an argument to be made that I intend to make that Instagram

132
00:09:20,245 --> 00:09:23,725
Speaker 1:  reels is actually a very compelling pick in this year's draft for precisely

133
00:09:23,725 --> 00:09:27,365
Speaker 1:  that reason. But we're gonna come back to that. So it's pretty

134
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,925
Speaker 1:  clear to me that Alex Crans won the draft last year.

135
00:09:31,685 --> 00:09:35,325
Speaker 1:  I would say, if you look at it, Peacock did the Olympics last year.

136
00:09:35,435 --> 00:09:38,925
Speaker 1:  Huge success. Netflix is like, has won the streaming wars

137
00:09:39,835 --> 00:09:43,725
Speaker 1:  Paramount Plus still exists, which was not guaranteed a year ago, but

138
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:47,445
Speaker 1:  it's still here doing stuff. By the way. Can I, can I be clear? MotorTrend

139
00:09:47,445 --> 00:09:51,085
Speaker 1:  TV did fold, but then it was purchased by something called

140
00:09:51,285 --> 00:09:54,685
Speaker 1:  the Velocity Network, which relaunched it as a regular cable channel.

141
00:09:55,385 --> 00:09:59,285
Speaker 1:  So it's, it's an 87 on the Go. 90 scale immediately. Yeah.

142
00:09:59,285 --> 00:10:03,005
Speaker 1:  It's, it's like a private equity. Go 90. It's good. It's good. Okay.

143
00:10:03,255 --> 00:10:06,565
Speaker 8:  Kranz is list is is filled with some, some, you know,

144
00:10:07,225 --> 00:10:11,005
Speaker 8:  I'm not saying Paramount Plus is a, a huge winner. Huge. But this list

145
00:10:11,065 --> 00:10:13,965
Speaker 8:  has just all of the channels. Like, it's, this is just everything that you

146
00:10:14,285 --> 00:10:18,245
Speaker 8:  actually want to watch. I don't know how you guys allowed this

147
00:10:18,245 --> 00:10:18,965
Speaker 8:  much to get,

148
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:23,165
Speaker 1:  I'm sorry. I have TikTok in the Disney bundle. I have a lock on everyone's

149
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:23,365
Speaker 1:  time.

150
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:27,165
Speaker 8:  You have, you have Bluey, which I think is, is big for a certain audience.

151
00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:28,605
Speaker 1:  And I have Hulu

152
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,565
Speaker 8:  Y that's that's true. Yeah. I

153
00:10:30,565 --> 00:10:32,925
Speaker 1:  Don't remember, I remember this being controversial that I got to pick the

154
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:33,485
Speaker 1:  bundle. It's sort

155
00:10:33,485 --> 00:10:33,685
Speaker 8:  Of cheating.

156
00:10:34,325 --> 00:10:37,205
Speaker 1:  I think Kranz picked Hulu with ads like solo or something. Mm.

157
00:10:38,325 --> 00:10:42,005
Speaker 1:  I believe she picked just Hulu. Either Hulu

158
00:10:42,145 --> 00:10:45,965
Speaker 1:  by itself or Hulu with live tv. I think that's the one

159
00:10:46,155 --> 00:10:49,965
Speaker 1:  because you had to solve live. Right? Right. So I think

160
00:10:49,965 --> 00:10:53,925
Speaker 1:  that's Hulu live tv, which is an important, which no longer

161
00:10:53,925 --> 00:10:54,285
Speaker 1:  exists.

162
00:10:56,235 --> 00:10:56,845
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Well

163
00:10:57,055 --> 00:11:00,325
Speaker 1:  Fully gone. 90. All right. I'm advocating for myself. What a surprise.

164
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:05,245
Speaker 1:  I think TikTok, the Disney bundle and Sunday Ticket and Max

165
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:09,685
Speaker 1:  is a winning lineup regardless of my, my

166
00:11:09,905 --> 00:11:13,645
Speaker 1:  Bravia core situation, which I hold dearly to my own heart.

167
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:17,885
Speaker 8:  If you wanna tell me that people who love anime weren't

168
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:21,765
Speaker 8:  the winners of 2024, then I, I

169
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:24,005
Speaker 8:  don't even know if we're in the same conversation.

170
00:11:24,665 --> 00:11:28,405
Speaker 1:  And somehow here in 2025 with the opening eye situation, they're the

171
00:11:28,515 --> 00:11:31,405
Speaker 1:  obvious losers this year.

172
00:11:32,795 --> 00:11:35,565
Speaker 1:  Alright, David, you got, you gotta make the, actually, Jake, I mean, I, I

173
00:11:35,645 --> 00:11:38,725
Speaker 1:  I I know you're repping crayons here, but you're the most neutral observer.

174
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:39,245
Speaker 1:  That's

175
00:11:39,245 --> 00:11:42,765
Speaker 8:  True. I'm absolutely not neutral here. Damn it. I'm all in on crayons. Can

176
00:11:42,845 --> 00:11:46,685
Speaker 8:  I tell you something? I prepped my list assuming I was gonna go

177
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:49,285
Speaker 8:  last, so I have to completely retool

178
00:11:49,285 --> 00:11:50,365
Speaker 1:  This now. Good. Even better.

179
00:11:50,885 --> 00:11:52,325
Speaker 8:  I was just like, there's no way I won.

180
00:11:52,415 --> 00:11:56,245
Speaker 1:  We're giving it to, to Jake both because I do think Alex won and

181
00:11:56,245 --> 00:11:59,565
Speaker 1:  because you're new and it feels like a nice thing to do. So that's the reason

182
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:03,405
Speaker 1:  I'm okay with this. I appreciate that. I think that I won on the merits and

183
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:06,885
Speaker 1:  boy is that gonna make, I have the only 80 megabit per second streaming service

184
00:12:07,065 --> 00:12:10,445
Speaker 1:  on this entire list. If you wanna watch Spider-Man movies,

185
00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:14,765
Speaker 1:  neli wins. You have to buy a new TV every time

186
00:12:14,765 --> 00:12:18,445
Speaker 1:  you wanna watch a movie. That's the rule. Like that's what I and

187
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:20,605
Speaker 1:  Sony's prices and with Sony's naming scheme.

188
00:12:22,595 --> 00:12:26,165
Speaker 1:  Yeah. If you can name two Sony televisions correctly, you can win.

189
00:12:28,145 --> 00:12:31,445
Speaker 1:  All right, Jake, you're it. So let me, let me remind everybody how this works.

190
00:12:31,665 --> 00:12:35,485
Speaker 1:  So we, we are going to pick seven streaming services each.

191
00:12:35,925 --> 00:12:38,965
Speaker 1:  This episode may take us several hours and

192
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:43,285
Speaker 1:  instead of just picking your favorite seven in order we each have to

193
00:12:43,285 --> 00:12:46,565
Speaker 1:  fill categories. Some of these are very simple and some of them are very

194
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:50,525
Speaker 1:  complicated. So the seven categories are Cheap, which means it has

195
00:12:50,525 --> 00:12:54,485
Speaker 1:  to have some tier under $10. It can be free, it can be

196
00:12:54,485 --> 00:12:57,525
Speaker 1:  nine point 99. It just, you have to be able to access this service for less

197
00:12:57,525 --> 00:13:01,365
Speaker 1:  than $10. That one's most of them. There's awards, which

198
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:05,085
Speaker 1:  means this service has to have won an Oscar. Any Oscar, big, small, I don't

199
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:08,845
Speaker 1:  care what it was, but it has to have won an Oscar 4K, which means it has

200
00:13:08,845 --> 00:13:12,725
Speaker 1:  to offer content in 4K live. The service has to have some kind of

201
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:16,045
Speaker 1:  live element, which is actually going to be much easier this year than it

202
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:19,965
Speaker 1:  was even last year. Niche. It has to be a genre

203
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:23,205
Speaker 1:  specific service. This one's a little mealy, but we'll figure it out together.

204
00:13:24,535 --> 00:13:28,125
Speaker 1:  There is content, which is a new thing this year, and that is you get to

205
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:31,285
Speaker 1:  pick a show or a movie from any streaming service

206
00:13:32,105 --> 00:13:35,475
Speaker 1:  that you didn't draft. So if you don't have Netflix, but you really want

207
00:13:35,595 --> 00:13:38,715
Speaker 1:  Squid Game, you can draft Squid Game as your thing. And that just goes on

208
00:13:38,715 --> 00:13:41,955
Speaker 1:  your roster as something that counts for you. It has to be on something you

209
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:45,675
Speaker 1:  didn't draft, but it can be anything you want. And then there's Wild Card,

210
00:13:45,805 --> 00:13:49,595
Speaker 1:  which is anything you want in the whole universe. Wait, is the content one,

211
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:53,635
Speaker 1:  the, the Torrent pick, like your one

212
00:13:53,635 --> 00:13:57,595
Speaker 1:  escape valve is you get to Torrent one show? No, I mean, I

213
00:13:57,595 --> 00:14:01,475
Speaker 1:  guess if you want, if it's like a weird European documentary you can't get

214
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:05,195
Speaker 1:  otherwise, then sure. No, I'm just saying like, if you don't pick Apple TV

215
00:14:05,225 --> 00:14:08,875
Speaker 1:  plus, but you want severance, you can just pick it. And the assumption is

216
00:14:09,855 --> 00:14:12,525
Speaker 1:  we're not gonna ask too many questions. Right. That that's, I that's what

217
00:14:12,525 --> 00:14:15,685
Speaker 1:  I'm getting at. Right? Like it's, we are just like, I'm gonna sneak into

218
00:14:15,685 --> 00:14:18,685
Speaker 1:  Ben Stiller's house and the dead of night and leave. Right. With some hard

219
00:14:18,685 --> 00:14:22,405
Speaker 1:  drives and find, okay. The conceit here is, is is breaking and

220
00:14:22,565 --> 00:14:26,365
Speaker 1:  entering. Yes, that's correct. I just wanna be clear. Yeah. Tiptoeing

221
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,965
Speaker 1:  around the category. Right? So each thing can only be

222
00:14:29,965 --> 00:14:33,845
Speaker 1:  drafted once, not once in each category, once period. And once it's

223
00:14:33,845 --> 00:14:37,725
Speaker 1:  gone, it's gone. So we are going to draft 21 unique things in

224
00:14:37,725 --> 00:14:40,965
Speaker 1:  this draft. Does that make sense? Any questions? Ready to go? Let's roll.

225
00:14:44,785 --> 00:14:46,645
Speaker 1:  All right, you're up first. Jake, what do you got? We're starting with Cheap.

226
00:14:46,955 --> 00:14:49,685
Speaker 1:  Well wait, you don't have to start with Cheap. No, you can go in any order

227
00:14:49,685 --> 00:14:51,685
Speaker 1:  you want. You just have to fill out the cart. I can anywhere if you

228
00:14:51,685 --> 00:14:55,525
Speaker 8:  Can do anything you want. Guys, guys, this is David. This rule sheet

229
00:14:55,525 --> 00:14:58,245
Speaker 8:  could have, could have been more detailed. Alright.

230
00:14:59,605 --> 00:14:59,825
Speaker 8:  Who

231
00:15:00,505 --> 00:15:04,145
Speaker 1:  I will say the, the key, just as someone who, as a veteran of this draft,

232
00:15:04,925 --> 00:15:07,865
Speaker 1:  you should think about the service that is most likely to be competitive

233
00:15:08,445 --> 00:15:12,385
Speaker 1:  and the category that is most likely to be difficult to

234
00:15:12,385 --> 00:15:13,185
Speaker 1:  fill out later

235
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:14,025
Speaker 8:  In. Yeah. Okay.

236
00:15:14,025 --> 00:15:16,265
Speaker 1:  Those, those are the two things I would keep in your head early in the draft.

237
00:15:16,285 --> 00:15:17,985
Speaker 1:  You know, David's a competitor. He's lying to you.

238
00:15:18,325 --> 00:15:21,665
Speaker 8:  I'm gonna start, I'm gonna start strong and I'm gonna go for Awards.

239
00:15:22,765 --> 00:15:25,225
Speaker 8:  And the Awards category is the, the category I hate the most because there

240
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:28,545
Speaker 8:  are three streaming services that have won Oscars.

241
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:33,025
Speaker 8:  It's not, not a long list. Normally I'm a, I'm a real hater of

242
00:15:33,025 --> 00:15:36,955
Speaker 8:  this streaming service, but in 2025, Netflix

243
00:15:37,295 --> 00:15:41,275
Speaker 8:  has the final season of Stranger Things, the final season of Squid Game

244
00:15:41,415 --> 00:15:44,555
Speaker 8:  and a new Knives out movie. And I'm sure there'll be some other stuff that's

245
00:15:44,555 --> 00:15:48,155
Speaker 8:  worth watching. So for those three alone, I'm gonna lock in Netflix

246
00:15:48,495 --> 00:15:49,635
Speaker 8:  for the awards category.

247
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:53,405
Speaker 1:  It's a good choice. I do, I think, I think Netflix

248
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,285
Speaker 1:  deserves to be the first overall pick in this draft.

249
00:15:57,475 --> 00:16:00,525
Speaker 8:  It's normally, I I, I'm very

250
00:16:01,485 --> 00:16:05,045
Speaker 8:  subscribe on, subscribe on Netflix. I feel like they have some

251
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:08,725
Speaker 8:  long periods of some like,

252
00:16:09,955 --> 00:16:12,405
Speaker 8:  reality ish stuff that I'm not super in love with.

253
00:16:13,825 --> 00:16:17,525
Speaker 8:  But they've got a handful of really great series and I'm gonna be

254
00:16:17,765 --> 00:16:21,245
Speaker 8:  subscribing at various points this year no matter what. So I feel pretty

255
00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:22,325
Speaker 8:  good about opening with Netflix.

256
00:16:23,345 --> 00:16:27,165
Speaker 1:  Are you consistently good at like, remembering to unsubscribe when

257
00:16:27,165 --> 00:16:30,445
Speaker 1:  you're done watching something? I like Aspire to be that good at switching

258
00:16:30,445 --> 00:16:32,885
Speaker 1:  streaming services and instead I just pay for too many of them. All

259
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:36,765
Speaker 8:  The amount of times that I look at the Netflix tile on my TV and go, oh,

260
00:16:36,905 --> 00:16:39,845
Speaker 8:  got unsubscribe is like 10 times higher than the amount of times I actually

261
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:40,885
Speaker 8:  unsubscribe. Okay.

262
00:16:41,035 --> 00:16:44,445
Speaker 1:  That makes me feel better. Like I just, I went to resubscribe to Paramount

263
00:16:44,445 --> 00:16:47,405
Speaker 1:  Plus to watch Champions League soccer because I subscribed to it to watch

264
00:16:47,565 --> 00:16:50,445
Speaker 1:  Champions League Soccer last year. And I was like, oh, I'll just resubscribe

265
00:16:50,445 --> 00:16:53,005
Speaker 1:  and do it this month. And found that I had just stayed subscribed the whole

266
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:56,245
Speaker 1:  time. So you're welcome. For my like $150 Paramount Plus.

267
00:16:57,025 --> 00:17:00,165
Speaker 8:  Hey, somebody's gotta keep them in business. Yeah. And lemme be specific

268
00:17:00,165 --> 00:17:03,045
Speaker 8:  here. I'm paying for 4K. Ooh.

269
00:17:03,145 --> 00:17:03,765
Speaker 1:  All right. Okay.

270
00:17:04,275 --> 00:17:05,885
Speaker 8:  Okay. I'm, I'm not dealing with ads. Yeah,

271
00:17:05,885 --> 00:17:09,565
Speaker 1:  That's very important. That is important. There was the first time we ever

272
00:17:09,565 --> 00:17:13,205
Speaker 1:  did this draft, there was a like, overall price component, but

273
00:17:13,205 --> 00:17:15,965
Speaker 1:  frankly it's too hard to track what these things cost anymore. So we just

274
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:18,245
Speaker 1:  gave up on that. It's just not worth it. And they'll all be different in

275
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:21,885
Speaker 1:  a year and who cares, but okay. You're, you're going high tier Netflix

276
00:17:22,545 --> 00:17:22,965
Speaker 8:  Oh, yeah.

277
00:17:23,105 --> 00:17:26,245
Speaker 1:  In the awards category. I like it for you. All right. Nila, you get to be

278
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:30,125
Speaker 1:  up second because Bravia cord is such a smashing success. Oh, don't

279
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:33,605
Speaker 1:  worry. I have more extremely weird choices to come. I'm starting

280
00:17:33,785 --> 00:17:36,285
Speaker 1:  strong again with Cheap and going with TikTok.

281
00:17:37,065 --> 00:17:37,285
Speaker 8:  Mm.

282
00:17:37,635 --> 00:17:41,125
Speaker 1:  I've picked it first two years in a row. Yep. And I'm sticking with it.

283
00:17:41,745 --> 00:17:45,165
Speaker 1:  You, you're not worried that this time next year there will be no TikTok

284
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,725
Speaker 1:  in the United States. I'm worried there won't be United States this time

285
00:17:47,725 --> 00:17:51,605
Speaker 1:  next year, David. So I'm just, just gonna close my eyes and, and, and

286
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:55,565
Speaker 1:  you know, where we will watch the downfall possibly on TikTok. It's very

287
00:17:55,565 --> 00:17:59,285
Speaker 1:  true. It's real. But yeah, I think, I think for the, the purpose

288
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:03,125
Speaker 1:  of this draft, you can't, you can't be worried about, you know, the nagging

289
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:07,045
Speaker 1:  ACL injury. You just gotta go, you gotta go with the consensus number one.

290
00:18:07,305 --> 00:18:11,045
Speaker 1:  Do you think so like, I think Netflix is pretty undeniably

291
00:18:11,045 --> 00:18:14,725
Speaker 1:  more powerful now than it was 12 months ago. Is TikTok,

292
00:18:15,265 --> 00:18:19,095
Speaker 1:  has TikTok gone up or down since we last did this draft? Sideways.

293
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,095
Speaker 1:  Okay. Right. It it just remains, it, it's so

294
00:18:23,695 --> 00:18:27,375
Speaker 1:  powerful. You can't get rid of it, but it's so

295
00:18:27,485 --> 00:18:31,415
Speaker 1:  weak that at any moment it might disappear. Hmm. Right. It might just collapse

296
00:18:31,415 --> 00:18:34,775
Speaker 1:  under its own weight or it might become this political pawn. But I think

297
00:18:34,775 --> 00:18:38,655
Speaker 1:  in terms of where the culture is day to day, and it's still TikTok, no

298
00:18:38,655 --> 00:18:42,575
Speaker 1:  one is, no one's opening Instagram reels to find new music. No one

299
00:18:42,575 --> 00:18:46,495
Speaker 1:  is forced to contend with like everyday Olivia Rodrigo is in

300
00:18:46,495 --> 00:18:50,215
Speaker 1:  a new South American country. And you just have to see it happen. Like

301
00:18:50,355 --> 00:18:54,085
Speaker 1:  that's TikTok and like the music industry is still dependent on it. There,

302
00:18:54,085 --> 00:18:57,885
Speaker 1:  there's just something. Ha White Lotus had its entire Parker pose moment

303
00:18:57,905 --> 00:19:01,885
Speaker 1:  on the back of TikTok. It's TikTok. Is it weaker

304
00:19:01,885 --> 00:19:05,685
Speaker 1:  than ever? Yes. As a, as a company, as an entity. I think culturally

305
00:19:05,685 --> 00:19:08,905
Speaker 1:  it's still strong as it has been. I think that's right. I don't know if it's,

306
00:19:08,905 --> 00:19:12,225
Speaker 1:  yeah, I I think sideways is probably right on that front. It's not, it doesn't

307
00:19:12,225 --> 00:19:16,185
Speaker 1:  feel like it's more central to culture than it was, but I think that's just

308
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:19,945
Speaker 1:  'cause we're so used to how central It is to like the, the, there are fewer

309
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,505
Speaker 1:  people being excited about. Like, it breaks some

310
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:26,705
Speaker 1:  30-year-old song becomes the number one hit again. 'cause we're just, that's

311
00:19:26,705 --> 00:19:30,585
Speaker 1:  just what happens. That's just how TikTok works now. Yeah. And the conspiracies

312
00:19:30,585 --> 00:19:34,225
Speaker 1:  about it are even weirder. Like Meta secretly runs the algorithm. Is that

313
00:19:34,265 --> 00:19:37,345
Speaker 1:  a conspiracy? Oh yeah. Like it was our, it's already been sold.

314
00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:42,145
Speaker 1:  There's just like another ing like it's become more of just a platform that

315
00:19:42,145 --> 00:19:46,105
Speaker 1:  everybody understands, to your point. But it still is the thing that creates

316
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:49,825
Speaker 1:  the cultural moments in a way that very few other platforms can do as

317
00:19:49,825 --> 00:19:52,955
Speaker 1:  regularly as TikTok does. But I like it.

318
00:19:53,855 --> 00:19:57,825
Speaker 1:  All right. You guys picked the two I was gonna pick Oh,

319
00:19:57,985 --> 00:20:01,585
Speaker 1:  a decision on the Disney bundle. By the way, we're gonna treat the Disney

320
00:20:01,585 --> 00:20:04,865
Speaker 1:  bundle as three separate things. There is no Disney bundle this year. You,

321
00:20:04,885 --> 00:20:08,025
Speaker 1:  you can, you can take Disney Plus, you can take ESPN and you can take Hulu,

322
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:10,905
Speaker 1:  but you can't take all three at once. Sure. Simple enough. Right? Oh, by

323
00:20:10,905 --> 00:20:13,385
Speaker 1:  the way, can I make one? Can I say one more thing about TikTok please? I've

324
00:20:13,385 --> 00:20:17,345
Speaker 1:  watched a number of movies on TikTok this year. Oh yeah. It,

325
00:20:17,405 --> 00:20:20,345
Speaker 1:  it might be all you need. I watched, do you know the Jason Statham movie?

326
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:24,185
Speaker 1:  The Beekeeper? Yeah. For some reason that is all over my TikTok

327
00:20:24,545 --> 00:20:26,865
Speaker 1:  recently. That's amazing. Yeah. Every now and again, TikTok is like, you

328
00:20:26,865 --> 00:20:29,265
Speaker 1:  know what, that's gonna happen. You're gonna watch a few Good Men and you

329
00:20:29,265 --> 00:20:33,145
Speaker 1:  just do, it's fine. Love it. It's just, it's just what goes down.

330
00:20:33,145 --> 00:20:36,905
Speaker 1:  It's great lately. It's like you, you, because of Al Comer, I've watched

331
00:20:37,145 --> 00:20:40,985
Speaker 1:  both Top Guns, but intercut with each other. Oh, that's fun. In a very odd

332
00:20:40,985 --> 00:20:42,185
Speaker 1:  way. Yeah. It's great. Sure.

333
00:20:44,215 --> 00:20:47,685
Speaker 1:  Okay. I I'm gonna take in

334
00:20:48,035 --> 00:20:48,325
Speaker 1:  live,

335
00:20:49,985 --> 00:20:53,505
Speaker 1:  I hate this already. I'm going with it. I'm gonna take YouTube TV in live.

336
00:20:53,765 --> 00:20:53,985
Speaker 1:  Woo.

337
00:20:55,695 --> 00:20:56,545
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Yeah, because

338
00:20:56,825 --> 00:21:00,565
Speaker 1:  I think live is one of the

339
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:04,405
Speaker 1:  trickier categories here because ev everything

340
00:21:04,405 --> 00:21:07,965
Speaker 1:  it does It is, is equally available other places and it's gonna get messy.

341
00:21:08,385 --> 00:21:11,645
Speaker 1:  And also YouTube TV is just kind of running away with it

342
00:21:12,185 --> 00:21:16,125
Speaker 1:  in terms of like, what is the future of cable? The answer's just YouTube

343
00:21:16,145 --> 00:21:19,325
Speaker 1:  TV. It is just winning this game. When you think about things of the future,

344
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:23,205
Speaker 1:  you think about cable pretty much, but it's for

345
00:21:23,205 --> 00:21:26,045
Speaker 1:  everything else is turning into bundles and YouTube TV is already that bundle.

346
00:21:26,275 --> 00:21:29,525
Speaker 1:  Yeah. The, the one thing about YouTube TV that confuses me

347
00:21:30,065 --> 00:21:33,825
Speaker 1:  is that Google has not just sold a YouTube TV

348
00:21:33,965 --> 00:21:37,345
Speaker 1:  device. Like any Google TV that you buy,

349
00:21:37,805 --> 00:21:40,985
Speaker 1:  it doesn't just light up with like YouTube TV is here,

350
00:21:41,695 --> 00:21:45,385
Speaker 1:  they have integrations, right. It's still an operating system with apps and

351
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:49,185
Speaker 1:  tiles and like, yes, you can get to a guide, but they, no one has.

352
00:21:49,765 --> 00:21:53,705
Speaker 1:  And I think only Google could do it just been like, it's a cable box,

353
00:21:53,915 --> 00:21:57,425
Speaker 1:  right? Like I have the Google TV streamer right there. Yeah. And I love it.

354
00:21:57,425 --> 00:22:01,065
Speaker 1:  It is a, It is a terrific set top box. But you're right. Like I, I want to

355
00:22:01,065 --> 00:22:04,825
Speaker 1:  be able to log into YouTube TV and the very first thing it shows me is not

356
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:08,105
Speaker 1:  the home screen. It should show me YouTube TV. Yeah. And then I should back

357
00:22:08,105 --> 00:22:11,705
Speaker 1:  out into the apps. Like that would make the whole experience better.

358
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:15,265
Speaker 1:  And I think more compelling. And it's funny 'cause Apple on the Apple TV

359
00:22:15,285 --> 00:22:18,585
Speaker 1:  has the button on their remote and they are desperate to make their app the

360
00:22:18,585 --> 00:22:21,185
Speaker 1:  actual interface. Yeah. But they don't have the content. And then Google

361
00:22:21,325 --> 00:22:24,265
Speaker 1:  has all of the content and they haven't done it.

362
00:22:24,355 --> 00:22:28,305
Speaker 8:  David, I feel like you're describing the old school, you

363
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:32,065
Speaker 8:  know, cable box where you just like went to on-demand content and like

364
00:22:32,065 --> 00:22:35,825
Speaker 8:  navigated through this super sluggish and slow interface to like watch

365
00:22:36,385 --> 00:22:40,285
Speaker 8:  whatever five movies are available for you. Which was not

366
00:22:40,465 --> 00:22:43,725
Speaker 8:  my favorite, but It is, you know, you jump right into stuff.

367
00:22:44,025 --> 00:22:47,765
Speaker 1:  It is, It is my strong belief that when you turn on your

368
00:22:47,765 --> 00:22:51,685
Speaker 1:  television, the first thing it should show you is not a home screen. I

369
00:22:51,685 --> 00:22:54,805
Speaker 1:  think that is like a disastrous product decision. We have let everybody make

370
00:22:54,955 --> 00:22:58,845
Speaker 1:  that. When I turn on my tv, it shouldn't show me television. It should

371
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:02,245
Speaker 1:  show me television put keep on the last thing I was watching,

372
00:23:02,755 --> 00:23:06,205
Speaker 1:  pick something for me and put it on. Like, I don't care what It is. It's

373
00:23:06,205 --> 00:23:08,605
Speaker 1:  like I, I don't turn on my TV to scroll through apps.

374
00:23:08,695 --> 00:23:12,605
Speaker 8:  David, are you pro Netflix autoplaying things? Yes,

375
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,805
Speaker 1:  But I'm not pro them doing it with volume. This

376
00:23:14,805 --> 00:23:18,005
Speaker 8:  Is gonna get you canceled. This is, that's an unacceptable Take the

377
00:23:18,055 --> 00:23:21,525
Speaker 1:  Tiles. This is, this is a conspiracy theory that I have not validated, but

378
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:25,445
Speaker 1:  believe to my bones when it autoplays in the tiles, It is 10

379
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:28,845
Speaker 1:  times louder than the actual volume of the program. Alright. We, we have

380
00:23:28,845 --> 00:23:31,725
Speaker 1:  to keep going. I will say it tries me, and I've asked any number of streaming

381
00:23:31,725 --> 00:23:35,485
Speaker 1:  executives this and I know David has to, all of them should make a fake TikTok

382
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:39,205
Speaker 1:  that when you're in the, that just shows you bits and pieces of middles of

383
00:23:39,205 --> 00:23:41,085
Speaker 1:  movies. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And then you can hit the button and it starts

384
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:41,605
Speaker 1:  playing on the tv.

385
00:23:41,825 --> 00:23:42,525
Speaker 8:  Yes. That's good.

386
00:23:42,765 --> 00:23:45,565
Speaker 1:  A hundred percent agree. Yeah. And they all love that idea and just absolutely

387
00:23:45,565 --> 00:23:49,085
Speaker 1:  cannot figure out how to do it. Alright, so that's my pick YouTube TV.

388
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:50,765
Speaker 1:  Jake, you're up next. What's up?

389
00:23:51,745 --> 00:23:55,645
Speaker 8:  All right. You guys got some good picks here. Those,

390
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:56,405
Speaker 8:  those sting,

391
00:23:58,095 --> 00:24:01,355
Speaker 8:  I'm gonna head over to what I think is going to be the,

392
00:24:02,465 --> 00:24:06,315
Speaker 8:  what, what feels like the next hardest category to me, which is 4K,

393
00:24:07,085 --> 00:24:11,075
Speaker 8:  which is sort of all of them, but also lends itself to I

394
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:14,995
Speaker 8:  think, just big mainstream services. And I think there's a couple left

395
00:24:15,065 --> 00:24:17,875
Speaker 8:  that, that feel pretty strong to me. I'm gonna,

396
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:20,675
Speaker 8:  guys, guys, I'm, I'm,

397
00:24:21,435 --> 00:24:23,285
Speaker 1:  It's amazing how hard it gets so quickly,

398
00:24:23,285 --> 00:24:27,085
Speaker 8:  Right. Second guessing myself as we speak, we're gonna

399
00:24:27,085 --> 00:24:30,605
Speaker 8:  lock in on, on Hulu. Hulu is

400
00:24:30,985 --> 00:24:34,445
Speaker 8:  trusty. It's reliable. It has a solid content of

401
00:24:35,825 --> 00:24:39,605
Speaker 8:  old TV shows. There's always something to watch there. They don't necessarily

402
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:43,525
Speaker 8:  have big winners, but they have a solid movie selection. You know, I've

403
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:47,485
Speaker 8:  got Netflix for some new original content. I feel

404
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:51,445
Speaker 8:  good about having Hulu as a backup there. It's a, it's a, It

405
00:24:51,445 --> 00:24:52,405
Speaker 8:  is a standby service.

406
00:24:53,085 --> 00:24:57,045
Speaker 1:  I don't hate it. I feel like 4K is just turning into the name a

407
00:24:57,045 --> 00:24:57,885
Speaker 1:  streaming service. Now

408
00:24:58,065 --> 00:24:58,765
Speaker 8:  It is a little bit,

409
00:24:59,885 --> 00:25:03,845
Speaker 1:  A little bit this, this category has gotten easier to, to match,

410
00:25:03,845 --> 00:25:07,765
Speaker 1:  which is good. But I think you're right, Jake, that It is increasingly, it's,

411
00:25:07,765 --> 00:25:10,805
Speaker 1:  it, this is another place to get one of the heavy hitters in here. Yeah.

412
00:25:10,805 --> 00:25:12,365
Speaker 1:  And so I think, I think you picked it, right? You,

413
00:25:12,365 --> 00:25:15,685
Speaker 8:  You both took the, the, the top like, you know, social options,

414
00:25:16,785 --> 00:25:19,325
Speaker 8:  I'm assuming, did, does YouTube TV include all of YouTube?

415
00:25:19,505 --> 00:25:22,325
Speaker 1:  No. Regular YouTube is is still available.

416
00:25:22,325 --> 00:25:23,885
Speaker 8:  Regular. YouTube is still available. If

417
00:25:23,885 --> 00:25:25,445
Speaker 1:  You'd like to change you, you are welcome to

418
00:25:26,005 --> 00:25:29,045
Speaker 8:  You regular YouTube is straight up on my list. Feel this feels like cheating

419
00:25:29,045 --> 00:25:32,085
Speaker 8:  to change this, but I, if, if regular YouTube is available, I'm gonna make

420
00:25:32,085 --> 00:25:33,605
Speaker 8:  that change. Okay. Please. Yeah.

421
00:25:34,225 --> 00:25:35,245
Speaker 1:  What's, what's your category

422
00:25:35,755 --> 00:25:39,285
Speaker 8:  Guys? No, I'm, I'm locking on, on Hulu. Forget this. Okay. We're, we're,

423
00:25:39,285 --> 00:25:41,565
Speaker 8:  we're we're holding to it. Okay.

424
00:25:42,445 --> 00:25:43,455
Speaker 1:  Hulu in 4K, Hulu,

425
00:25:43,485 --> 00:25:44,535
Speaker 8:  Hulu. And It is in 4K people.

426
00:25:44,735 --> 00:25:47,495
Speaker 1:  I think Hulu is kind of underrated these days. There's a lot of good stuff

427
00:25:47,495 --> 00:25:50,935
Speaker 1:  on Hulu. Like the, the original, although I've been watching Paradise.

428
00:25:51,535 --> 00:25:55,135
Speaker 1:  That's very good. Highly recommend. But there's just, it's like Hulu is

429
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:59,255
Speaker 1:  the one I go to where it's just like, there's just 1,000,030 minute sitcoms

430
00:25:59,255 --> 00:26:01,775
Speaker 1:  that I'm going to enjoy. Yeah. It's because it's Fox. Yeah. Like fundamentally

431
00:26:01,775 --> 00:26:02,775
Speaker 1:  it's Fox. Yeah. Right.

432
00:26:02,885 --> 00:26:06,815
Speaker 8:  Hulu is the most boring pick. Nobody's ever like super hyped to open

433
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:07,975
Speaker 8:  up Hulu and see the new thing.

434
00:26:09,515 --> 00:26:12,775
Speaker 8:  But it, it has the thing that you are going to watch after a long day and

435
00:26:12,775 --> 00:26:16,055
Speaker 8:  you're just like, I need to put something on like when the TV auto plays

436
00:26:16,055 --> 00:26:18,015
Speaker 8:  something, it should be whatever is on Hulu

437
00:26:18,795 --> 00:26:20,335
Speaker 1:  Cat. You're picking catalog. Yes.

438
00:26:20,335 --> 00:26:21,335
Speaker 8:  This makes sense. This is, yeah.

439
00:26:21,365 --> 00:26:24,815
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I don't hit it. I'm, I'm, I'm with it. It's a good one. Neli. What's

440
00:26:24,815 --> 00:26:28,495
Speaker 1:  next? What do you got? I'm gonna put Max in awards.

441
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:32,695
Speaker 1:  Mm mm That's my move. Okay. Because because you, you get that

442
00:26:32,815 --> 00:26:36,645
Speaker 1:  HBO I'm assuming the pit will will be up for awards this year.

443
00:26:37,565 --> 00:26:41,295
Speaker 1:  They've got the movies, they've got the catalog of movies. Feel, it feels

444
00:26:41,295 --> 00:26:45,275
Speaker 1:  correct to me. It's a little like, I I don't think Max Originals have won

445
00:26:45,335 --> 00:26:49,315
Speaker 1:  Oscars yet, but it's like HBO. Yeah. It's, it's, the Lion

446
00:26:49,335 --> 00:26:51,555
Speaker 1:  is straight enough that I'll I'll give it to you. Yeah, we'll, we'll allow

447
00:26:51,555 --> 00:26:55,285
Speaker 1:  it. Why, why Max? Are you sure? Yeah.

448
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:59,405
Speaker 1:  Is Max gonna still be here? That's, is America

449
00:26:59,405 --> 00:27:00,485
Speaker 1:  still gonna be here David?

450
00:27:02,195 --> 00:27:05,565
Speaker 1:  Like this is a very nihilistic draft for me. Like I'm thinking about tomorrow.

451
00:27:05,865 --> 00:27:09,725
Speaker 1:  I'm not thinking about next year. Okay. Fair enough. But I, max has the depth

452
00:27:09,825 --> 00:27:13,765
Speaker 1:  of content it has, it's funny, I have to log into someone

453
00:27:13,825 --> 00:27:17,685
Speaker 1:  else's max account to get 4K. Right. It's like I can't put it in 4K

454
00:27:17,805 --> 00:27:21,565
Speaker 1:  'cause I don't have it in 4K because I'm still grandfathered into my at

455
00:27:21,885 --> 00:27:25,685
Speaker 1:  t free max subscription, which at t knows about because I

456
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:29,205
Speaker 1:  keep mentioning it on the show and they can't figure out how to stop giving

457
00:27:29,205 --> 00:27:32,285
Speaker 1:  me free Max either. Perfect. But it's only in 10 80 p

458
00:27:33,055 --> 00:27:36,725
Speaker 1:  which is just very weird. You know, I've got a daughter, the hair, the

459
00:27:36,725 --> 00:27:40,285
Speaker 1:  Harry Potter movies are on Max. There's, there's a lot here. We've been watching

460
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:44,165
Speaker 1:  those together. They get a little too scary after four for a 6-year-old.

461
00:27:44,165 --> 00:27:47,845
Speaker 1:  Mm. So we're just gonna wait to watch the additional four movies,

462
00:27:47,945 --> 00:27:51,365
Speaker 1:  but we're gonna watch those first four over and over again. Love it. Yeah.

463
00:27:51,405 --> 00:27:54,325
Speaker 1:  I mean like, it, it's just, it has the catalog and then it has HBO. So if,

464
00:27:54,325 --> 00:27:58,005
Speaker 1:  if that white lotus righteous gemstones moment, that's

465
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:02,085
Speaker 1:  important to me. I'm not a, I'm not a like turn on any garbage TV watch

466
00:28:02,085 --> 00:28:06,005
Speaker 1:  room. I'm a very intentful TV washer. Do you cancel services?

467
00:28:06,115 --> 00:28:08,725
Speaker 1:  Like, do you like watch your show and then bail for a while until you wanna

468
00:28:08,725 --> 00:28:11,725
Speaker 1:  come back? I've been trying to cancel Max like five years, least t's given

469
00:28:11,725 --> 00:28:14,285
Speaker 1:  it to me free. I wanna cancel more.

470
00:28:15,705 --> 00:28:19,565
Speaker 1:  The challenge is my wife watches tons and tons of comedy

471
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:23,405
Speaker 1:  specials and they're on every service. Right. And so

472
00:28:23,405 --> 00:28:26,125
Speaker 1:  you're just kinda like, well I canceled the one you want today. And then

473
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:29,765
Speaker 1:  we just like start it again. Including recently Hulu, which is deep into

474
00:28:29,765 --> 00:28:31,605
Speaker 1:  comedy. All of the sudden, I think they've all figured out this is like a

475
00:28:32,005 --> 00:28:35,925
Speaker 1:  reliable source of Cheap content that they can get at

476
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:39,765
Speaker 1:  a cadence that people will watch. Yeah. And people will always watch. Yep.

477
00:28:40,105 --> 00:28:43,365
Speaker 1:  And then clip it and put it on TikTok. And that's where I live, which is

478
00:28:43,365 --> 00:28:46,445
Speaker 1:  the other thing that is all over my TikTok all the time is just like, stand

479
00:28:46,445 --> 00:28:50,325
Speaker 1:  up. Like Nate Boetti is two thirds of my TikTok at any given

480
00:28:50,325 --> 00:28:51,525
Speaker 1:  moment. Okay.

481
00:28:53,045 --> 00:28:56,565
Speaker 1:  I worry I'm gonna run out of awards possibilities here. So I'm gonna take

482
00:28:58,715 --> 00:29:02,615
Speaker 1:  Amazon Prime video in Awards because otherwise I think there's

483
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:05,575
Speaker 1:  a decent chance there's just not going to be anything left for me to pick.

484
00:29:06,055 --> 00:29:09,375
Speaker 1:  Interesting. For too long. I think Prime

485
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:14,055
Speaker 1:  is working. It's like the, the football thing is going very well. They

486
00:29:14,515 --> 00:29:16,535
Speaker 1:  way overpaid. They're gonna start doing bond stuff.

487
00:29:18,075 --> 00:29:21,295
Speaker 1:  People seem to like reacher, I guess. Sure. That's a, that's a show.

488
00:29:22,885 --> 00:29:26,255
Speaker 1:  Matt Bella from Puck just recently described it to me as guys with guns shows

489
00:29:26,275 --> 00:29:28,215
Speaker 1:  and Amazon's very good at guys with guns shows. So

490
00:29:30,665 --> 00:29:34,295
Speaker 1:  Prime is like, it's like the least interesting, totally

491
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:37,695
Speaker 1:  mainstream service, but I'll take it.

492
00:29:38,045 --> 00:29:40,815
Speaker 1:  Have you been watching the Lord of the Ring Show?

493
00:29:42,025 --> 00:29:45,525
Speaker 1:  No, I have not watched that one. And I have not watched Citadel, which are

494
00:29:45,525 --> 00:29:49,085
Speaker 1:  the ones that Amazon spent all of its money on. Yes. And

495
00:29:49,295 --> 00:29:53,285
Speaker 1:  maybe why they now have a new person in charge. Yeah. But I did watch

496
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:56,885
Speaker 1:  a bunch of like whatever weird stuff Jeremy Clarkson is up to these days,

497
00:29:57,245 --> 00:30:00,725
Speaker 1:  I will always watch on crime video. So that works for me. He's like, we've

498
00:30:00,725 --> 00:30:04,485
Speaker 1:  done something irresponsible with a cup. He bought a Lamborghini

499
00:30:04,485 --> 00:30:07,445
Speaker 1:  tractor and made like three episodes of a TV show about that. And I was like,

500
00:30:07,445 --> 00:30:10,725
Speaker 1:  yeah, I'll watch this. This sounds great. You are very much like whatever's

501
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:13,325
Speaker 1:  on you. Like that's why you just want the TV to start playing stuff at you

502
00:30:13,435 --> 00:30:16,485
Speaker 1:  sometimes. So like my, my parents used to make fun of me because

503
00:30:17,365 --> 00:30:20,685
Speaker 1:  I would, I could, I loved to take naps. I still do love to take naps, but

504
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:22,005
Speaker 1:  I always nap with the TV on.

505
00:30:23,595 --> 00:30:27,405
Speaker 1:  It's just, it's like I can turn my brain off when I'm halfway listening

506
00:30:27,465 --> 00:30:31,285
Speaker 1:  to a TV show I've seen before. And so there's like background

507
00:30:31,295 --> 00:30:35,285
Speaker 1:  television is a bigger part of my life than I'm proud of. Like I do a

508
00:30:35,285 --> 00:30:38,085
Speaker 1:  lot of like watching TV while I do other things

509
00:30:39,105 --> 00:30:42,125
Speaker 1:  and that's where service is like prime video, where it's like a thing I've

510
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:45,925
Speaker 1:  seen before but, or something I haven't seen but like don't really need to

511
00:30:45,925 --> 00:30:49,285
Speaker 1:  look at is very helpful. Can you write while you're listening to music with

512
00:30:49,285 --> 00:30:52,885
Speaker 1:  words? God no. Okay. Absolutely not. I can't do anything creative in that

513
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:56,685
Speaker 1:  headspace. Like the language center of my brain does not let me listen

514
00:30:56,685 --> 00:31:00,285
Speaker 1:  to music with lyrics while I am writing or communicating. No. And

515
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,205
Speaker 1:  it's the same. I can't believe you can do it with tv, but I guess you're

516
00:31:03,205 --> 00:31:06,965
Speaker 1:  just like passed out. No, I can't, I can't do any like creative

517
00:31:07,145 --> 00:31:10,485
Speaker 1:  act while something like that is on, but it's like if I'm, if I'm cooking

518
00:31:10,665 --> 00:31:14,485
Speaker 1:  or cleaning or napping or whatever, like, I almost always

519
00:31:14,485 --> 00:31:17,325
Speaker 1:  will have like an episode of the Office on in the background. It's like a,

520
00:31:17,325 --> 00:31:20,685
Speaker 1:  it's basically a podcast. Like I, I listen to TV shows the way some people

521
00:31:20,685 --> 00:31:24,445
Speaker 1:  listen to podcasts and I also listen to podcasts. This, this explains a lot

522
00:31:24,445 --> 00:31:28,205
Speaker 1:  of your picks over the years. There you go. Alright, so

523
00:31:28,235 --> 00:31:31,605
Speaker 1:  just to recap and then we're gonna take a break. Jake, so far has picked

524
00:31:31,605 --> 00:31:35,525
Speaker 1:  Netflix in awards and Hulu in 4K. Eli

525
00:31:35,525 --> 00:31:39,285
Speaker 1:  so far has picked TikTok in Cheap and Max in awards, and I have

526
00:31:39,285 --> 00:31:42,445
Speaker 1:  YouTube TV in live and Amazon Prime in awards.

527
00:31:43,015 --> 00:31:45,565
Speaker 1:  We're gonna take a really quick break and then we're gonna come back, do

528
00:31:45,565 --> 00:31:46,765
Speaker 1:  some more categories. We'll be right back.

529
00:35:25,975 --> 00:35:28,945
Speaker 1:  case against a streaming service anymore. Right.

530
00:35:28,985 --> 00:35:32,825
Speaker 8:  I I think like genuinely this is not a problem for most people.

531
00:35:33,025 --> 00:35:35,625
Speaker 8:  I mean, I listen, if they were interrupting the middle of the movie, I would

532
00:35:36,065 --> 00:35:39,125
Speaker 8:  complain to the end of the earth that you would never hear the end of me.

533
00:35:39,425 --> 00:35:43,125
Speaker 8:  But it's not bad at all. I've watched a handful of movies on it over the

534
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:46,765
Speaker 8:  past year. I think, you know, we've seen these free

535
00:35:46,765 --> 00:35:50,205
Speaker 8:  streaming services continue to get more and more promotion. It feels like

536
00:35:50,205 --> 00:35:54,005
Speaker 8:  there is more attention on them than ever. I don't necessarily know that

537
00:35:54,005 --> 00:35:57,885
Speaker 8:  two Bs in for a big breakout year, but I feel good about it as a Cheap

538
00:35:57,885 --> 00:35:58,125
Speaker 8:  pick.

539
00:35:58,435 --> 00:36:01,765
Speaker 1:  Well, so, okay, this is, this is the thing. I was waiting until somebody

540
00:36:01,765 --> 00:36:04,845
Speaker 1:  picked Tubi to ask because I've been thinking about this ever since the Super

541
00:36:04,845 --> 00:36:08,445
Speaker 1:  Bowl, right? Tubi had the Super Bowl lots of people watched was a big hit,

542
00:36:08,445 --> 00:36:12,005
Speaker 1:  did very well. The stream held up like Good job Tubi. Do you feel like

543
00:36:12,155 --> 00:36:16,085
Speaker 1:  Tubi has held on to any of that? Right? Like the hope is

544
00:36:16,085 --> 00:36:18,765
Speaker 1:  you get this big giant spike of interest and then it comes back down, but

545
00:36:18,765 --> 00:36:21,765
Speaker 1:  it doesn't come all the way down and it like resets a little higher. But

546
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:25,645
Speaker 1:  I don't feel like even slightly more people seem to be talking

547
00:36:25,645 --> 00:36:27,205
Speaker 1:  about Tubi than they were before the Super Bowl.

548
00:36:27,325 --> 00:36:30,765
Speaker 8:  I do think that's a challenge. The, the, the way I end up on Tubi is that

549
00:36:30,765 --> 00:36:34,605
Speaker 8:  I go to look up where I can watch a certain movie and then I'm

550
00:36:34,605 --> 00:36:38,085
Speaker 8:  told that for whatever reason It is free on Tubi or the only place It is

551
00:36:38,085 --> 00:36:41,525
Speaker 8:  available is on Tubi. But the act actually, I will say like the thing where

552
00:36:41,525 --> 00:36:45,125
Speaker 8:  It is only available on Tubi happens more often than I would expect.

553
00:36:45,565 --> 00:36:49,285
Speaker 8:  I think there is just this weird catalog of slightly less popular

554
00:36:49,465 --> 00:36:53,365
Speaker 8:  movies. You know, somebody wants Top Gun that's gonna end

555
00:36:53,365 --> 00:36:56,725
Speaker 8:  up on a major streaming service. I hope that's true. I haven't checked, I,

556
00:36:56,805 --> 00:37:00,725
Speaker 8:  I watched The Long Goodbye very famous movie. I think it maybe won an Oscar.

557
00:37:01,325 --> 00:37:04,765
Speaker 8:  Hopefully. That's right. You know, thi this is like a big movie back in the

558
00:37:04,765 --> 00:37:08,045
Speaker 8:  day. It is only available I think on Tubi or something like that. And I think

559
00:37:08,045 --> 00:37:11,845
Speaker 8:  like there's a whole collection of films like that that are overlooked by

560
00:37:11,845 --> 00:37:15,565
Speaker 8:  these services that are extremely cutthroat on,

561
00:37:15,905 --> 00:37:19,605
Speaker 8:  you know, is this going to hook my mainstream subscriber base?

562
00:37:20,745 --> 00:37:23,165
Speaker 8:  And there's just stuff that you like cannot find. And since we're looking

563
00:37:23,165 --> 00:37:26,365
Speaker 8:  for stuff that you can stream, I want to be, I wanna have those options.

564
00:37:27,885 --> 00:37:31,645
Speaker 1:  I, I think the thing you said about like, I just Google it and it clicks

565
00:37:31,645 --> 00:37:35,405
Speaker 1:  me to Tubi is like a underrated, powerful thing in

566
00:37:35,575 --> 00:37:38,485
Speaker 1:  Toy's Favor. And it has been the thing forever, right? In most cases you

567
00:37:38,485 --> 00:37:41,325
Speaker 1:  don't even have to log in. You don't have to have an account, you just click

568
00:37:41,345 --> 00:37:45,125
Speaker 1:  the thing and it starts playing the movie. And there are almost no other

569
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:48,645
Speaker 1:  entertainment experiences outside of like social platforms

570
00:37:48,915 --> 00:37:52,645
Speaker 1:  that work that way. Yes. Anymore. And that's kudos to

571
00:37:52,675 --> 00:37:53,725
Speaker 1:  Tubi for pulling that off.

572
00:37:54,365 --> 00:37:57,005
Speaker 8:  I am confused how they got the Super Bowl. That still is Well

573
00:37:57,005 --> 00:37:57,805
Speaker 1:  They, they're owned by Fox

574
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,085
Speaker 8:  And they chose Tubi

575
00:38:00,115 --> 00:38:02,965
Speaker 1:  Because they wanted to, they wanted to drive Tubi. I installed. Yeah. Because

576
00:38:02,965 --> 00:38:06,165
Speaker 1:  they don don't have another streaming service. Yeah. I mean, Fox doesn't

577
00:38:06,165 --> 00:38:10,005
Speaker 1:  have an app. Fox has like Fox Nation Live or whatever. Like you can't

578
00:38:10,005 --> 00:38:10,485
Speaker 1:  drive, right?

579
00:38:10,485 --> 00:38:11,325
Speaker 8:  Right. Those are not the same

580
00:38:11,805 --> 00:38:15,645
Speaker 1:  Americans to that app. Right. So it's not a choice that Fox

581
00:38:15,645 --> 00:38:17,205
Speaker 1:  can can make. I mean, so

582
00:38:17,205 --> 00:38:18,045
Speaker 8:  They're like, the post show is

583
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:20,845
Speaker 1:  Where can we stream the Super Bowl? It wasn't the Fox Sports app, which is

584
00:38:20,845 --> 00:38:24,805
Speaker 1:  like a cable login. It's our big mainstream

585
00:38:25,075 --> 00:38:25,845
Speaker 1:  fast competitor.

586
00:38:25,995 --> 00:38:26,285
Speaker 8:  Yeah.

587
00:38:26,585 --> 00:38:28,565
Speaker 1:  And that, I think they got all those logins that way.

588
00:38:28,565 --> 00:38:29,525
Speaker 8:  That works. It was very smart

589
00:38:29,525 --> 00:38:32,085
Speaker 1:  Of them. Yeah, that roofer, Murdoch Wiley.

590
00:38:32,825 --> 00:38:34,005
Speaker 8:  He knows what he's doing. Yeah. Yeah.

591
00:38:34,305 --> 00:38:38,285
Speaker 1:  Fox now is apparently working on some other big streaming service that

592
00:38:38,285 --> 00:38:42,045
Speaker 1:  I'm sure is gonna go super great for them. I think it's a good pick. I'm

593
00:38:42,045 --> 00:38:45,325
Speaker 1:  in favor. I had to be very high on my list here. Neela, what's next for you?

594
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:45,685
Speaker 1:  What do you got?

595
00:38:47,355 --> 00:38:50,165
Speaker 1:  I've been making a lot of a lot of decisions here while you guys were talking,

596
00:38:50,555 --> 00:38:54,405
Speaker 1:  I've been working my board really hard. This motor. It's a

597
00:38:54,405 --> 00:38:57,845
Speaker 1:  motor trend tv. I'm going back and forth between two of them. And

598
00:38:59,005 --> 00:39:02,645
Speaker 1:  I think what I've decided is that there's no chance

599
00:39:03,515 --> 00:39:07,415
Speaker 1:  that either of you will pick the thing that

600
00:39:07,415 --> 00:39:11,045
Speaker 1:  I'm worried about. So I'm gonna go another way. And then when I make that

601
00:39:11,045 --> 00:39:14,885
Speaker 1:  pick, I reveal what it was. Okay. All right. Does that work for you? Okay.

602
00:39:14,995 --> 00:39:18,805
Speaker 1:  Okay. So for 4K I'm picking Disney Plus. Mm. Oh mm. Yeah,

603
00:39:18,805 --> 00:39:22,045
Speaker 1:  that's what I was gonna do next. Yeah. I was, I was, this is me working the

604
00:39:22,045 --> 00:39:25,835
Speaker 1:  board. Yeah. I'm a little surprised it lasted this long. Yeah, it's tough.

605
00:39:25,865 --> 00:39:29,715
Speaker 1:  It's a, it's, it's a, if you have children, it's a requirement. It four

606
00:39:29,835 --> 00:39:33,355
Speaker 1:  KI, we gotta work, we gotta talk about the 4K category as it exists

607
00:39:33,665 --> 00:39:37,515
Speaker 1:  next year. But it's in 4K you get all the Disney movies in

608
00:39:37,515 --> 00:39:41,275
Speaker 1:  4K. So it's slots in here. Well, bluey obviously

609
00:39:41,275 --> 00:39:45,075
Speaker 1:  very important, but Frozen two shockingly important in my

610
00:39:45,075 --> 00:39:48,995
Speaker 1:  household. Same, like, very important. I don't know how to explain

611
00:39:48,995 --> 00:39:52,715
Speaker 1:  to Max that one song is basically just a Peter Satera song from the eighties,

612
00:39:53,495 --> 00:39:56,955
Speaker 1:  but It is a song is called Lost in the Woods and it's a banger.

613
00:39:57,975 --> 00:40:00,395
Speaker 1:  I'm like, you know, there's this band called Chicago and she's like, I don't

614
00:40:00,395 --> 00:40:04,075
Speaker 1:  care about this. And then I try to make everybody listen to Chicago, which

615
00:40:04,115 --> 00:40:07,675
Speaker 1:  I don't even like listening to, but I just have to make the point. And everyone's

616
00:40:07,675 --> 00:40:11,595
Speaker 1:  like, what is happening in this house? So that's very important to us as

617
00:40:11,595 --> 00:40:15,155
Speaker 1:  just a weekend cycle that we go through and then you get all, you get all

618
00:40:15,155 --> 00:40:19,115
Speaker 1:  the Marvel stuff you get and or it's all there for you. Like Yeah, it, it,

619
00:40:19,135 --> 00:40:22,075
Speaker 1:  it, Disney Plus the only other one I would say should have been a number

620
00:40:22,075 --> 00:40:25,755
Speaker 1:  one pick. This is a shocking slide because you can, you can make a,

621
00:40:25,995 --> 00:40:29,435
Speaker 1:  a good argument for number one. Yeah. I, I agree. I I

622
00:40:30,035 --> 00:40:33,115
Speaker 1:  I think It is that is going to be the thing I picked if you didn't, so I,

623
00:40:33,195 --> 00:40:37,155
Speaker 1:  I buy it. I will say I have one Bob Iger, I know you're listening. I have

624
00:40:37,155 --> 00:40:40,955
Speaker 1:  one complaint I would like to make about Disney Plus, which is they just

625
00:40:41,115 --> 00:40:44,955
Speaker 1:  launched like 24 7 Simpsons Stream. It's basically a fast channel, but

626
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:48,955
Speaker 1:  it's all Simpsons very good idea. Except for some reason my

627
00:40:48,975 --> 00:40:52,835
Speaker 1:  2-year-old now, every time I open the Disney Plus app, It is,

628
00:40:52,835 --> 00:40:56,795
Speaker 1:  It is right at like his pointing level and he runs over to it and goes

629
00:40:56,955 --> 00:41:00,555
Speaker 1:  Simpsons. And it turns out that if you put on

630
00:41:00,555 --> 00:41:04,155
Speaker 1:  Simpsons, someone will say the word hell within

631
00:41:04,415 --> 00:41:08,355
Speaker 1:  six seconds. And so I can't watch it. But now he, every single

632
00:41:08,355 --> 00:41:12,075
Speaker 1:  morning he just runs over and he just goes, Simpsons. And I don't, I

633
00:41:12,235 --> 00:41:16,075
Speaker 1:  I don't know how to That's rough. Tell him that this cartoon is illegal for

634
00:41:16,075 --> 00:41:19,955
Speaker 1:  him. We had the parental controls on ours messed up. We,

635
00:41:20,275 --> 00:41:24,195
Speaker 1:  I had the messed up and for some reason I had set

636
00:41:24,195 --> 00:41:27,675
Speaker 1:  it so that Unrated TV shows would show up on

637
00:41:27,845 --> 00:41:31,715
Speaker 1:  Max's profile. And so she opened it and the first thing in front of her

638
00:41:31,715 --> 00:41:35,645
Speaker 1:  face was the UFC. And I was like, this isn't, this isn't

639
00:41:35,645 --> 00:41:37,325
Speaker 1:  right. This doesn't go next to Milana. Oh

640
00:41:37,325 --> 00:41:37,525
Speaker 8:  Boy.

641
00:41:38,155 --> 00:41:41,605
Speaker 1:  Like no, thank you and I, you gotta go dig through it. They, there's some

642
00:41:41,605 --> 00:41:44,565
Speaker 1:  real messy Disney brand stuff happening

643
00:41:45,345 --> 00:41:47,635
Speaker 1:  because the parental controls are so confusing. The

644
00:41:47,835 --> 00:41:50,355
Speaker 8:  Gambling they've put next to Frozen is out of control.

645
00:41:51,545 --> 00:41:55,475
Speaker 1:  It's true. ESP n bet is right there. Will she

646
00:41:55,475 --> 00:41:58,675
Speaker 1:  pull it off this time? Like you, you say that, but we're we're like rapidly

647
00:41:59,035 --> 00:42:02,875
Speaker 1:  veering towards that and especially now that all the

648
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:06,155
Speaker 1:  stuff is in there, right? Like Hulu is now totally integrated and ESPN is

649
00:42:06,155 --> 00:42:09,875
Speaker 1:  totally integrated and all of the stuff is now just in Disney. Plus

650
00:42:11,025 --> 00:42:14,995
Speaker 1:  there's some pretty like, racy stuff that shows up at

651
00:42:14,995 --> 00:42:18,755
Speaker 1:  the top of the page while I'm looking to start Frozen two for the 85th

652
00:42:18,755 --> 00:42:22,515
Speaker 1:  time. It's a little weird. Yeah. It's, it's just a weird brand. And

653
00:42:22,515 --> 00:42:25,595
Speaker 1:  this is why they didn't do it. Right. This is why they had the other, this

654
00:42:25,595 --> 00:42:29,115
Speaker 1:  is why they had Hulu and then they weren't getting, this is the same as

655
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:32,995
Speaker 1:  why did you go to Tubi? Like we'll just shove it on Disney Plus. Yeah. It's

656
00:42:32,995 --> 00:42:36,395
Speaker 1:  a lot. Yeah. But I, I feel, I feel confident with, especially as a third

657
00:42:36,395 --> 00:42:40,115
Speaker 1:  pick in the 4K category. Yeah. So I'm run. It's a good pick. I'm winning

658
00:42:40,135 --> 00:42:42,515
Speaker 1:  so far. I just wanna be very clear about this. Yeah. We're, we're all really

659
00:42:42,515 --> 00:42:43,115
Speaker 1:  proud of you Teli.

660
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:48,835
Speaker 1:  I, as much as I don't want to have two YouTube things,

661
00:42:49,075 --> 00:42:52,635
Speaker 1:  I feel like at this point I have to pick like YouTube

662
00:42:52,855 --> 00:42:56,395
Speaker 1:  man. It is, It is by a mile the most watched

663
00:42:56,945 --> 00:43:00,435
Speaker 1:  streaming service. It is. Like it has won the internet. Yep.

664
00:43:01,275 --> 00:43:05,155
Speaker 1:  I now have, I now have Amazon Prime YouTube TV and YouTube,

665
00:43:05,715 --> 00:43:09,555
Speaker 1:  which makes me like the least interesting American consumer

666
00:43:09,575 --> 00:43:09,795
Speaker 1:  of

667
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:12,875
Speaker 8:  All time. You know what that gets you though, not only does that get you

668
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:17,235
Speaker 8:  Mr. Beast channel, it gets you Amazon's Mr. Beast Reality

669
00:43:17,235 --> 00:43:17,515
Speaker 8:  show.

670
00:43:18,135 --> 00:43:20,755
Speaker 1:  That's true. I get Mr. Beast and Beast Games. Wait, what category are you

671
00:43:20,755 --> 00:43:21,795
Speaker 1:  in? I'm trying to decide.

672
00:43:23,315 --> 00:43:26,215
Speaker 1:  I think I'm gonna put it in 4K because

673
00:43:27,195 --> 00:43:30,535
Speaker 1:  So you're paying for premium on principle? I'm paying for premium.

674
00:43:31,095 --> 00:43:34,815
Speaker 1:  Okay. I, I like, I seriously believe

675
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:38,535
Speaker 1:  that no ads on YouTube is the best money I pay for entertainment

676
00:43:38,585 --> 00:43:42,495
Speaker 1:  every month. And wait is premium 4K on TVs? Is that a thing on

677
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:45,455
Speaker 1:  YouTube? Yeah. Am I just making that up? It's not all, not everything is

678
00:43:45,455 --> 00:43:49,375
Speaker 1:  4K, but It is, It is. You do get lots of 4K stuff and you don't, if

679
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:52,855
Speaker 1:  you have ads that, I don't know, I'm truly just paying for no ads.

680
00:43:53,415 --> 00:43:57,015
Speaker 1:  I am, I am happy. So, but why does it, why does that go in the four K content?

681
00:43:57,015 --> 00:44:00,845
Speaker 1:  Because I get four K content. I could put it in Cheap if I was doing

682
00:44:01,065 --> 00:44:03,965
Speaker 1:  ads is my point. Right. But I'm not doing that. I'm, I'm saying you might

683
00:44:03,965 --> 00:44:07,925
Speaker 1:  have to put this in Wild Card, but I get four K content because you're not

684
00:44:07,925 --> 00:44:11,795
Speaker 1:  buying it for 4K. Oh, interesting. Well, no,

685
00:44:11,795 --> 00:44:15,705
Speaker 1:  but it doesn't. I get 4K. There is 4K. We

686
00:44:15,705 --> 00:44:18,225
Speaker 1:  gotta, we gotta rethink this whole category. Marques Brown's out here doing

687
00:44:18,225 --> 00:44:21,385
Speaker 1:  it in like 16 k. I could have made that a category. So we're gonna rename

688
00:44:21,385 --> 00:44:25,305
Speaker 1:  this crispy. Yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah, we can do that. You

689
00:44:25,305 --> 00:44:29,025
Speaker 1:  wanna do that? Alright. I'm, I'm allowing it this year. Okay. But I, I think

690
00:44:29,025 --> 00:44:33,005
Speaker 1:  the 4K category is under a lot of pressure. Okay. That's fair. Maybe,

691
00:44:33,005 --> 00:44:35,805
Speaker 1:  maybe that is the one that, that needs to change. 'cause you're right that

692
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:39,845
Speaker 1:  access to four K content is increasingly just everywhere.

693
00:44:40,665 --> 00:44:44,645
Speaker 1:  No, it's, it's, well, you, it's gated. It's, you have to pay for it

694
00:44:44,645 --> 00:44:48,585
Speaker 1:  everywhere. Right. I don't know, you sent us your notes, but Jake

695
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:52,025
Speaker 1:  picked Hulu and you just get it on Hulu. So we're, we're, we're, we'll allow

696
00:44:52,025 --> 00:44:55,505
Speaker 1:  it this year, but fair. This is under reconsideration for 2026 and, and I

697
00:44:55,505 --> 00:44:58,745
Speaker 1:  would like to hear the feedback about it. Yeah, agreed. All right. So I'm

698
00:44:58,745 --> 00:45:02,345
Speaker 1:  picking, I'm picking YouTube main or YouTube. YouTube main YouTube Premium.

699
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:05,295
Speaker 1:  I feel good about it. Jake, you're up. What do you got?

700
00:45:05,295 --> 00:45:08,015
Speaker 8:  All right guys, I have a real problem here, which is

701
00:45:09,435 --> 00:45:13,295
Speaker 8:  at this point, David's got YouTube, Neil's got TikTok. I don't really have

702
00:45:13,295 --> 00:45:17,095
Speaker 8:  a social presence here. So I'm, I'm gonna throw something out there. I need

703
00:45:17,095 --> 00:45:19,975
Speaker 8:  you to tell me if, if this, if this fits, if I'm combining too many things

704
00:45:20,595 --> 00:45:24,255
Speaker 8:  or the, the requirement for the live categories, there needs to be some sort

705
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:28,235
Speaker 8:  of live content. I don't need that live content to be any good.

706
00:45:28,715 --> 00:45:29,955
Speaker 8:  I just need this service. That's

707
00:45:29,955 --> 00:45:31,155
Speaker 1:  Correct. It just needs to be live.

708
00:45:31,735 --> 00:45:35,395
Speaker 8:  Listen, hit me up with Instagram reels is a perfectly fine

709
00:45:35,395 --> 00:45:39,235
Speaker 8:  knockoff and there's some live streams in there. Oh, I don't, I

710
00:45:39,235 --> 00:45:42,235
Speaker 8:  don't know what they're doing. They're selling some stuff. Whatever. I will

711
00:45:42,235 --> 00:45:45,895
Speaker 8:  watch all your tiktoks two weeks later. And you know what you're

712
00:45:45,895 --> 00:45:49,775
Speaker 1:  Going with Instagram Live for your live. Yeah. Okay. So this, this

713
00:45:49,775 --> 00:45:53,335
Speaker 1:  is Neli makes the correct point. You can't have Instagram as a whole. I can

714
00:45:53,575 --> 00:45:55,095
Speaker 1:  'cause Instagram as a whole is not a streaming service. Are

715
00:45:55,155 --> 00:45:56,575
Speaker 8:  Are reels and live one thing.

716
00:45:56,835 --> 00:46:00,615
Speaker 1:  No, which is your problem. You can have reels or you can have live, but you

717
00:46:00,665 --> 00:46:01,695
Speaker 1:  can't have both.

718
00:46:02,115 --> 00:46:03,215
Speaker 8:  You know what guys, because in

719
00:46:03,215 --> 00:46:05,895
Speaker 1:  Classic Instagram fashion, they've made them two different products where

720
00:46:05,895 --> 00:46:08,495
Speaker 1:  there are one product on, on, on TikTok. They are two different features.

721
00:46:08,595 --> 00:46:08,935
Speaker 1:  Why are

722
00:46:08,935 --> 00:46:09,375
Speaker 8:  They two different

723
00:46:09,575 --> 00:46:11,175
Speaker 1:  Features? Because YouTube hates you.

724
00:46:11,755 --> 00:46:14,095
Speaker 8:  Here's the thing, I'm locking it in Instagram Live.

725
00:46:14,555 --> 00:46:14,775
Speaker 1:  Wow.

726
00:46:15,165 --> 00:46:19,055
Speaker 8:  It's rough. Listen, there's a big year ahead for Instagram. Tiktoks

727
00:46:19,055 --> 00:46:22,795
Speaker 8:  getting banned. Instagram's gonna have to figure their product out. It's

728
00:46:22,795 --> 00:46:26,635
Speaker 8:  gonna be one thing. And I'm, this is, this is a long play. Yeah.

729
00:46:26,635 --> 00:46:27,115
Speaker 8:  It's just a long

730
00:46:27,115 --> 00:46:29,275
Speaker 1:  Play in the decaying corpse of versus It

731
00:46:29,275 --> 00:46:30,395
Speaker 8:  Is someone is gonna have

732
00:46:30,755 --> 00:46:30,875
Speaker 1:  A

733
00:46:31,185 --> 00:46:34,755
Speaker 8:  Rock and roll Instagram Live by the end of 2025.

734
00:46:35,665 --> 00:46:38,795
Speaker 8:  This is gonna pay off. It's gonna be more interesting than if I had chosen

735
00:46:39,115 --> 00:46:42,155
Speaker 8:  Sling Blue. So I feel good about this.

736
00:46:43,135 --> 00:46:47,115
Speaker 1:  So Jake, the, the thing that might work for you here is that like you,

737
00:46:47,175 --> 00:46:50,795
Speaker 1:  you now have to actively root for TikTok to be banned. That's, that is the

738
00:46:50,795 --> 00:46:53,915
Speaker 1:  main thing you need for this pic to pay off. Because now there's all these,

739
00:46:54,815 --> 00:46:57,875
Speaker 1:  all this reporting and rumors out there about, like, Instagram is once again

740
00:46:57,875 --> 00:47:01,355
Speaker 1:  trying to capitalize on TikTok going away and like, maybe they're gonna do

741
00:47:01,675 --> 00:47:04,955
Speaker 1:  a separate app again. And like there are people out there who are like, IGTV

742
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:07,355
Speaker 1:  was a good idea. We just, you know, bad timing and

743
00:47:07,355 --> 00:47:09,275
Speaker 8:  They're finally making an iPad app. Maybe

744
00:47:09,815 --> 00:47:13,475
Speaker 1:  It could happen. It really, it could happen. You have to know like, Instagram's

745
00:47:13,675 --> 00:47:16,435
Speaker 1:  response to TikTok being banned is iPad app.

746
00:47:17,635 --> 00:47:18,035
Speaker 8:  Yeah, yeah.

747
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:19,195
Speaker 1:  What's going on? They

748
00:47:19,195 --> 00:47:20,755
Speaker 8:  Can pull this off. They can get there.

749
00:47:21,545 --> 00:47:23,195
Speaker 1:  Like, what are, what are we doing?

750
00:47:23,425 --> 00:47:26,755
Speaker 8:  They're gonna buy Meka or something. Like they're gonna pull it all together.

751
00:47:27,605 --> 00:47:30,885
Speaker 1:  Love it. I'm excited for you. But yeah, you are now I I,

752
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:34,405
Speaker 8:  This, this one I'm buying low, trying to sell high here.

753
00:47:34,995 --> 00:47:38,845
Speaker 1:  Okay. Not sure. Again, everyone's very confused about by the stock market

754
00:47:38,985 --> 00:47:42,925
Speaker 1:  and that might be us too, so that's fine. Yeah. So

755
00:47:42,925 --> 00:47:45,765
Speaker 1:  I will say this means Instagram reels is still available.

756
00:47:46,865 --> 00:47:50,405
Speaker 1:  You can still have it if you want. I can't You picked Instagram Live. Yeah.

757
00:47:50,505 --> 00:47:53,005
Speaker 8:  I'm like, okay. Yeah, no, I feel, I feel I feel absolutely fine about this.

758
00:47:53,035 --> 00:47:56,925
Speaker 1:  It's funny 'cause I don't, I, my prediction is that reels will not get

759
00:47:56,925 --> 00:48:00,845
Speaker 1:  picked over the course of this draft, but it's live. I've

760
00:48:00,845 --> 00:48:04,525
Speaker 1:  got picked. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I I agree with both of those assessments.

761
00:48:04,635 --> 00:48:05,245
Speaker 1:  What was your

762
00:48:05,245 --> 00:48:07,085
Speaker 8:  Third place? Live pick.

763
00:48:07,925 --> 00:48:10,265
Speaker 1:  Oh, this is my, it's my pick now. Are you, are you, oh, this is, you're up.

764
00:48:10,285 --> 00:48:13,945
Speaker 1:  Go for it. This is what I was, this is what I all, this is what I was trying

765
00:48:13,945 --> 00:48:17,865
Speaker 1:  to game out against David. Okay. Because I know the NFL is important to

766
00:48:17,865 --> 00:48:21,135
Speaker 1:  both of us. So I'm just picking Sunday Ticket

767
00:48:21,225 --> 00:48:24,695
Speaker 1:  standalone. Mm. Which you can just buy. Yeah, you can,

768
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:28,895
Speaker 1:  you don't need YouTube TV. You can just buy it. It's a

769
00:48:28,895 --> 00:48:32,415
Speaker 1:  million dollars. But that's my live pick. Yeah. You don't even need, I don't

770
00:48:32,415 --> 00:48:35,375
Speaker 1:  even think you need YouTube Premium. You can truly buy it on its own. Yeah.

771
00:48:35,375 --> 00:48:38,535
Speaker 1:  And you just get it on like the YouTube page, which is a weird way to watch

772
00:48:38,775 --> 00:48:42,465
Speaker 1:  football. Like it, that's just, we it's just that's a weird thing.

773
00:48:42,565 --> 00:48:46,545
Speaker 1:  Yes. Yeah. But all of my games are out of market, so this works for

774
00:48:46,545 --> 00:48:49,745
Speaker 1:  me. So yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm just picking dead ahead Sunday Ticket.

775
00:48:51,055 --> 00:48:54,425
Speaker 1:  Interesting. All right. That's fair. I was not gonna pick it only because

776
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:57,905
Speaker 1:  God helped me. I cannot have another YouTube product. But,

777
00:48:58,365 --> 00:49:01,025
Speaker 1:  but it's a good pick. And it seems to, it seems to be working. Do you get,

778
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:05,305
Speaker 1:  if you buy Sunday Ticket on its own, isn't it like $500 a season or something

779
00:49:05,305 --> 00:49:08,265
Speaker 1:  insane. Yeah. It's like, it's like three 50 or something. It's, it's nuts.

780
00:49:08,295 --> 00:49:12,185
Speaker 1:  It's all to watch the Packers lose the Wild Card round. It's, it's not, it's

781
00:49:12,185 --> 00:49:16,165
Speaker 1:  nuts. Even, even if you like buy it in like the regular, like, I have

782
00:49:16,165 --> 00:49:19,285
Speaker 1:  a real playoffs problem here. I mean, I gotta figure something out, but I'll

783
00:49:19,285 --> 00:49:20,205
Speaker 1:  go to the bar, it'll be fine.

784
00:49:22,275 --> 00:49:25,245
Speaker 1:  Okay. All right. So you got Sunday Ticket. I feel good about it. Go to the

785
00:49:25,245 --> 00:49:26,045
Speaker 8:  Bar is Wild Card.

786
00:49:26,065 --> 00:49:29,605
Speaker 1:  And, and by the way, it, even if you have Sunday Ticket, you,

787
00:49:30,025 --> 00:49:33,085
Speaker 1:  the NFL is like, here's a game on Amazon Prime. Like, it's all bad.

788
00:49:33,915 --> 00:49:37,415
Speaker 1:  So the, there's a reason I was asking you about that piracy, backstop. You

789
00:49:37,415 --> 00:49:41,175
Speaker 1:  see what I'm saying? Yeah, it's good. All right. My next

790
00:49:41,175 --> 00:49:44,935
Speaker 1:  pick, I think I'm going Cheap. I think I'm gonna

791
00:49:44,935 --> 00:49:46,295
Speaker 1:  pick Peacock,

792
00:49:48,155 --> 00:49:51,705
Speaker 1:  which I just confirmed. You can still get for $8 a month.

793
00:49:52,555 --> 00:49:55,105
Speaker 1:  We're not publishing this episode for a few days, so that's plenty of time

794
00:49:55,105 --> 00:49:56,705
Speaker 1:  for them to raise the price. But

795
00:49:58,735 --> 00:50:02,595
Speaker 1:  Peacock continues to be the, like, play.

796
00:50:02,835 --> 00:50:06,595
Speaker 1:  I watch the Office and Parks and Rec and

797
00:50:06,735 --> 00:50:10,555
Speaker 1:  New Girl, and it's increasingly getting like pretty good movies pretty

798
00:50:10,555 --> 00:50:14,155
Speaker 1:  quickly after they come out. It's just, it's kind of,

799
00:50:14,825 --> 00:50:18,435
Speaker 1:  it's, it's, it's doing a thing. I suppose this is where we should disclose

800
00:50:18,435 --> 00:50:22,235
Speaker 1:  that. Comcast, NBC Universal is a investor in our parent

801
00:50:22,235 --> 00:50:25,795
Speaker 1:  company at Vox Media, round five. They do not pay for my

802
00:50:26,035 --> 00:50:29,965
Speaker 1:  cock still exists. Round five. Yeah, exactly. Disclosure.

803
00:50:30,905 --> 00:50:34,765
Speaker 1:  But yeah, I think, I think I, I'm doing it just because I

804
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:38,045
Speaker 1:  still haven't watched Wicked. And at some point this year I'm going to watch

805
00:50:38,245 --> 00:50:41,405
Speaker 1:  Wicked and I need Peacock to watch Wicked, so I think I'm doing it. Yeah.

806
00:50:41,755 --> 00:50:43,605
Speaker 8:  Peacock. Eventually you'll watch Wicked

807
00:50:44,135 --> 00:50:48,085
Speaker 1:  Dirty Comcast money well spent. Yes. And

808
00:50:48,085 --> 00:50:49,525
Speaker 1:  Poker face. Jake, like you said.

809
00:50:49,525 --> 00:50:52,925
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I know. It's real, it's real. Poker face. They got some, they got that

810
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:53,285
Speaker 8:  one show.

811
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:57,605
Speaker 1:  There's a lot of like SNL 50 stuff I still have to watch. Like there's, I

812
00:50:57,605 --> 00:50:58,125
Speaker 1:  got stuff to do.

813
00:50:58,335 --> 00:51:02,045
Speaker 8:  Which by the way is also on your other pick. YouTube. Oh,

814
00:51:02,045 --> 00:51:05,875
Speaker 1:  Crap. You're right. That's okay. I'm just, I'm just SNL for

815
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:06,315
Speaker 1:  life now.

816
00:51:08,345 --> 00:51:12,275
Speaker 1:  This is good. All right. I'm taking, I'm taking Peacock. All

817
00:51:12,275 --> 00:51:15,235
Speaker 1:  right, let's do one more round before we take another break.

818
00:51:16,305 --> 00:51:16,875
Speaker 1:  Jake, you're

819
00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:19,115
Speaker 8:  Up. What you got? All right guys, are you ready for this? It's about to hit

820
00:51:19,115 --> 00:51:23,075
Speaker 8:  the, the Niche category. Tell me, have

821
00:51:23,075 --> 00:51:26,115
Speaker 8:  you ever thought to yourself, I would love to watch

822
00:51:27,115 --> 00:51:31,035
Speaker 8:  a 14 hour documentary about the history of New York

823
00:51:31,035 --> 00:51:33,635
Speaker 8:  City by Ken Burns brother,

824
00:51:34,895 --> 00:51:35,835
Speaker 1:  By Ken Burns brother.

825
00:51:36,055 --> 00:51:38,195
Speaker 8:  That's great. Have you ever thought

826
00:51:38,555 --> 00:51:38,955
Speaker 1:  Zen Burns

827
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:42,955
Speaker 8:  Boy, these bootleg clips of Antique Road show that I'm seeing on TikTok,

828
00:51:44,275 --> 00:51:45,835
Speaker 8:  I would love to check out the entire series

829
00:51:47,655 --> 00:51:48,755
Speaker 8:  PBS Passport. Yeah.

830
00:51:49,015 --> 00:51:49,235
Speaker 1:  Wow.

831
00:51:49,895 --> 00:51:52,755
Speaker 8:  I'm telling you, this is a winner. All right. And if you need this specific

832
00:51:52,755 --> 00:51:56,675
Speaker 8:  genre, I'm gonna say this is TV you can fall asleep to. I

833
00:51:56,675 --> 00:52:00,355
Speaker 8:  think this is gonna be a big hit. You get to help

834
00:52:00,355 --> 00:52:04,275
Speaker 8:  support public access tv, which hopefully will exist by the end

835
00:52:04,275 --> 00:52:04,555
Speaker 8:  of this year.

836
00:52:04,555 --> 00:52:05,675
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Will not be here next year.

837
00:52:05,975 --> 00:52:08,635
Speaker 8:  And you know what? Your subscription to PBS Passport will help.

838
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:10,685
Speaker 1:  All right. I respect it.

839
00:52:10,805 --> 00:52:11,725
Speaker 8:  I feel good about this one.

840
00:52:12,205 --> 00:52:15,565
Speaker 1:  A big theme here is that everyone is falling asleep to the tv.

841
00:52:16,875 --> 00:52:20,245
Speaker 1:  Like, why are we all paying so much money for streaming services when mostly

842
00:52:20,245 --> 00:52:21,605
Speaker 1:  what we're doing is passing out, oh,

843
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:23,965
Speaker 8:  I've got more where that comes from. Okay. Just, just wait.

844
00:52:24,235 --> 00:52:27,205
Speaker 1:  That also appears to be how everyone watches tv. Like, do you, do you guys

845
00:52:27,205 --> 00:52:30,285
Speaker 1:  ever see this thing that flips around every once in a while? That one of

846
00:52:30,285 --> 00:52:34,005
Speaker 1:  the directives Netflix gives to people who are making a show is that

847
00:52:34,805 --> 00:52:38,205
Speaker 1:  everyone has to always say what they're thinking and what's happening out

848
00:52:38,205 --> 00:52:41,645
Speaker 1:  loud, because most people aren't watching the show. So they have to like

849
00:52:41,645 --> 00:52:45,365
Speaker 1:  you, you can't, there can't be any unsaid important

850
00:52:45,365 --> 00:52:48,685
Speaker 1:  details in a Netflix show because they understand that lots of people are

851
00:52:48,685 --> 00:52:51,325
Speaker 1:  just sitting there looking at their phone, so they have to say everything

852
00:52:51,385 --> 00:52:54,845
Speaker 1:  out loud and it drives creatives absolutely insane. But like, this is the

853
00:52:54,845 --> 00:52:55,525
Speaker 1:  world we live in now.

854
00:52:56,075 --> 00:52:58,445
Speaker 8:  This is horrifying. This is also what you just described earlier, where you're

855
00:52:58,445 --> 00:53:00,845
Speaker 8:  just like, I have TV on in the background while I'm cooking all the time.

856
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:01,805
Speaker 8:  And this is like how you watch

857
00:53:01,985 --> 00:53:05,205
Speaker 1:  And it's just people, everything doing exposition all day long in the background

858
00:53:05,205 --> 00:53:06,165
Speaker 1:  of David Fs. Yes.

859
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:12,165
Speaker 1:  Yeah. This Apple is delicious. Like there's a reason

860
00:53:12,165 --> 00:53:15,765
Speaker 1:  that Hollywood is dying and it's that, and the Frame tv, which we will come

861
00:53:15,765 --> 00:53:19,485
Speaker 1:  to it time. It's, it's bleak out there. All right. PBS

862
00:53:19,595 --> 00:53:23,285
Speaker 1:  Love it. No notes. Neli, what do you got? All right.

863
00:53:23,425 --> 00:53:26,885
Speaker 1:  My, I'm, it's, it's time, it's time for Neli to do a, a Niche

864
00:53:27,475 --> 00:53:31,125
Speaker 1:  pick as well. Okay. So I am picking Kaleidoscope,

865
00:53:31,815 --> 00:53:35,765
Speaker 1:  which is an ultra high Bitrate day in date movie server.

866
00:53:36,035 --> 00:53:36,325
Speaker 1:  What?

867
00:53:36,665 --> 00:53:37,045
Speaker 8:  Oh God.

868
00:53:37,315 --> 00:53:40,845
Speaker 1:  What? You gotta have one. You gotta have one. Ugh. So run Kaleidoscope,

869
00:53:41,465 --> 00:53:44,925
Speaker 1:  you have to buy a server called the Terra Prime, which you like put in a

870
00:53:45,005 --> 00:53:47,885
Speaker 1:  rack in your basement. 'cause obviously you have a rack in your basement.

871
00:53:48,705 --> 00:53:51,085
Speaker 1:  The Terra Prime for the 24 terabyte version is

872
00:53:51,705 --> 00:53:55,285
Speaker 1:  $10,500. And then you need to buy

873
00:53:56,265 --> 00:54:00,245
Speaker 1:  the Strato C or Strato V players for all the TV in your house. The Strato

874
00:54:00,285 --> 00:54:04,205
Speaker 1:  C is the budget model. That's $3,000. The Strato V, which is a

875
00:54:04,205 --> 00:54:08,165
Speaker 1:  player, and with an integrated server that's $4,000. And

876
00:54:08,165 --> 00:54:11,485
Speaker 1:  then you get day and date, you can buy full quality movies.

877
00:54:12,185 --> 00:54:13,005
Speaker 8:  How much is the movie?

878
00:54:13,145 --> 00:54:16,525
Speaker 1:  The movies are tremendously expensive. Is this the service that like Tom

879
00:54:16,525 --> 00:54:20,405
Speaker 1:  Cruise uses to watch theatrical movies in his, in his home

880
00:54:20,405 --> 00:54:23,205
Speaker 1:  theater? There's a little bit of that going on. It feels like they're a little

881
00:54:23,335 --> 00:54:27,165
Speaker 1:  later now than they used to be. Okay. There's this thing called the Bel

882
00:54:27,165 --> 00:54:30,925
Speaker 1:  Air Circuit where all the houses in, in Bel Air have like screening rooms

883
00:54:30,925 --> 00:54:33,325
Speaker 1:  in them, like get day and date. They used to be the circuit because they,

884
00:54:33,325 --> 00:54:36,365
Speaker 1:  they run the physical reels around. Now there's digital distribution,

885
00:54:37,705 --> 00:54:41,445
Speaker 1:  but the movies are not always expensive. It depends, right? Like, some of

886
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:44,445
Speaker 1:  them are $30, but some of them are like $200. 'cause their day and date.

887
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:49,345
Speaker 1:  Okay. I'm just, I'm on Kaleido Escape's webpage. And Jake, I just wanna read

888
00:54:49,345 --> 00:54:52,065
Speaker 1:  you this paragraph. Okay. Which is the most neli coded thing I think I've

889
00:54:52,065 --> 00:54:55,185
Speaker 1:  ever heard. It says, Kaleidescape movie experts annotate each movie with

890
00:54:55,185 --> 00:54:58,825
Speaker 1:  data such as screen size and credit and intermission cues. This allows our

891
00:54:58,825 --> 00:55:01,905
Speaker 1:  players to integrate with your home automation to dim lights, close shades,

892
00:55:01,905 --> 00:55:05,145
Speaker 1:  and adjust seating when the titles roll and automatically screen mask to

893
00:55:05,145 --> 00:55:08,225
Speaker 1:  match the ratio of each film, immersive experiences that streaming services

894
00:55:08,225 --> 00:55:11,385
Speaker 1:  simply can't achieve. Like, I guarantee you Neli read this and just started

895
00:55:11,385 --> 00:55:13,505
Speaker 1:  just slinging money at his computer screen. The, the

896
00:55:13,505 --> 00:55:17,145
Speaker 8:  Worst part about this is that Eli's right? Like this is, this sounds awesome.

897
00:55:17,325 --> 00:55:19,985
Speaker 8:  Easily the sickest thing. This sounds incredible. Yeah, yeah.

898
00:55:20,175 --> 00:55:24,065
Speaker 1:  Like easily the sickest possible movie experience. I have stared

899
00:55:24,085 --> 00:55:27,745
Speaker 1:  in a Kaleidescape so many times and like, I should sell one of my cars

900
00:55:28,045 --> 00:55:30,065
Speaker 1:  and I can't, I don't watch enough movies.

901
00:55:30,805 --> 00:55:32,225
Speaker 8:  One of us picked Tubi, the other pick

902
00:55:33,855 --> 00:55:37,825
Speaker 8:  like $30,000 set up to watch a, A Wicked Yes. Hell yes.

903
00:55:38,145 --> 00:55:38,545
Speaker 8:  Slightly early.

904
00:55:38,945 --> 00:55:42,625
Speaker 1:  I have a cousin who sent me a picture of the rack in his

905
00:55:42,645 --> 00:55:46,585
Speaker 1:  brother-in-law's house in Virginia with like five Strato

906
00:55:46,645 --> 00:55:50,225
Speaker 1:  vs in it. And I was like, I'm going to this house. Like, let's go. Like,

907
00:55:51,165 --> 00:55:52,105
Speaker 1:  I'm very excited about it.

908
00:55:52,495 --> 00:55:53,785
Speaker 8:  What screens do we play

909
00:55:53,785 --> 00:55:57,025
Speaker 1:  On? I've been winning this entire time to make this pick. God. When do you

910
00:55:57,025 --> 00:56:00,705
Speaker 1:  do it? I could have, I could have done it. Number one, I've been on edge

911
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:01,105
Speaker 1:  this

912
00:56:01,105 --> 00:56:04,385
Speaker 8:  Whole, some one of us could have gotten there first.

913
00:56:04,975 --> 00:56:07,145
Speaker 1:  It's Yeah, easily the sickest movie experience you can have.

914
00:56:07,145 --> 00:56:07,625
Speaker 8:  It sounds great.

915
00:56:08,405 --> 00:56:09,425
Speaker 1:  It is realistic.

916
00:56:09,605 --> 00:56:10,385
Speaker 8:  You watch it on the frame,

917
00:56:11,445 --> 00:56:14,785
Speaker 1:  You watch it on the garbage. No, you have to build, you don't have to, but

918
00:56:14,785 --> 00:56:17,025
Speaker 1:  you're supposed to build a theater so that

919
00:56:17,025 --> 00:56:18,225
Speaker 8:  The, but It is optional at that point

920
00:56:18,225 --> 00:56:22,145
Speaker 1:  So that the Strato v Yeah. Can send 12 volt triggers to various

921
00:56:22,455 --> 00:56:25,805
Speaker 1:  home automation devices. I'm just imagining you being like, max, I'm so sorry.

922
00:56:25,805 --> 00:56:28,805
Speaker 1:  You have to move out of your bedroom and turning it into the Kaleidescape

923
00:56:28,805 --> 00:56:29,005
Speaker 1:  Theater.

924
00:56:31,035 --> 00:56:34,165
Speaker 1:  It's very good. I'm very excited about this idea. I've never been more excited

925
00:56:34,165 --> 00:56:36,605
Speaker 1:  about anything actually. That's good stuff. I think you might only need a

926
00:56:36,605 --> 00:56:39,845
Speaker 1:  Strato V at this point. I don't know. It's just a lot of money. That's, that's

927
00:56:39,845 --> 00:56:43,325
Speaker 1:  what I have for you. I honestly, if you sell your car, you will go fewer

928
00:56:43,325 --> 00:56:47,165
Speaker 1:  places, so you'll have more time to watch movies. It's true. You'll

929
00:56:47,165 --> 00:56:51,125
Speaker 1:  I'll just be alone in my house. Look, if anybody is listening and you wanna

930
00:56:51,125 --> 00:56:53,845
Speaker 1:  tell us about your kaleidoscope, we will come to your house and watch movies.

931
00:56:55,085 --> 00:56:58,325
Speaker 1:  I will be there. Yeah. This is not a question. It'll fine. And then you will

932
00:56:58,325 --> 00:57:00,645
Speaker 1:  wake up and you'll be like, where did my kaleidoscope go?

933
00:57:02,985 --> 00:57:06,765
Speaker 1:  All right. I am gonna go content and I'm gonna pick Stranger Things Season

934
00:57:06,765 --> 00:57:07,045
Speaker 1:  five,

935
00:57:08,575 --> 00:57:12,445
Speaker 1:  which I think is going to be enormous and humongous

936
00:57:12,465 --> 00:57:14,325
Speaker 1:  and might win me this draft all by itself.

937
00:57:16,135 --> 00:57:19,775
Speaker 1:  I think in terms of like stuff that is going to be on streaming services

938
00:57:20,155 --> 00:57:24,095
Speaker 1:  in between now and next year, this one is the one that is like,

939
00:57:24,675 --> 00:57:27,895
Speaker 1:  if I can't have Netflix, at least I get to have Stranger Things. Yeah.

940
00:57:27,975 --> 00:57:29,655
Speaker 8:  I think that's a, that's a, a big win for you.

941
00:57:30,795 --> 00:57:34,495
Speaker 1:  The se the season might be awful. Like I, there's a, all these actors are

942
00:57:34,495 --> 00:57:38,415
Speaker 1:  like in their forties now. Yeah. They've been doing this for forever. It's,

943
00:57:38,415 --> 00:57:42,335
Speaker 1:  it's gonna, it's gonna be insane. But I I kind of feel like everyone on Earth

944
00:57:42,355 --> 00:57:42,975
Speaker 1:  is gonna watch it.

945
00:57:43,525 --> 00:57:46,735
Speaker 8:  It's also, it's like the biggest thing that Netflix will have maybe ever,

946
00:57:46,735 --> 00:57:50,655
Speaker 8:  right? Like this is, is the single biggest show they've had. At least

947
00:57:50,655 --> 00:57:51,335
Speaker 8:  like culturally,

948
00:57:52,845 --> 00:57:56,375
Speaker 8:  this conclusion has been coming for years. I think a lot of people are very

949
00:57:56,375 --> 00:58:00,135
Speaker 8:  hyped about it. I'm very hyped for it. I'm not even necessarily sure it's

950
00:58:00,135 --> 00:58:03,175
Speaker 8:  gonna be amazing, but yeah, I'm excited. So, yeah. Good. I think, I think

951
00:58:03,175 --> 00:58:04,095
Speaker 8:  that's a good get for you.

952
00:58:04,655 --> 00:58:07,535
Speaker 1:  I I feel good about it. I'm a little worried it's not gonna come out this

953
00:58:07,535 --> 00:58:11,495
Speaker 1:  year because it has been like imminent for a very long time. But I I

954
00:58:11,815 --> 00:58:15,535
Speaker 1:  I have faith. Yeah. And I choose to believe that it's gonna happen.

955
00:58:16,455 --> 00:58:16,695
Speaker 1:  I think

956
00:58:17,165 --> 00:58:18,455
Speaker 8:  They can get it there. I almost

957
00:58:18,455 --> 00:58:21,135
Speaker 1:  Picked Ted Lasso season four, but then I knew Nene I would make fun of me

958
00:58:21,135 --> 00:58:23,615
Speaker 1:  for a really long time. Yeah. And I just don't need that in my life. Well,

959
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:26,575
Speaker 1:  I just wanna tell you that Kaleidescape streams in 65 megabits per second,

960
00:58:26,575 --> 00:58:30,135
Speaker 1:  which is higher than a 4K Blue. I knew when you had not said anything in

961
00:58:30,135 --> 00:58:34,055
Speaker 1:  a minute, it was because you were reading Kaleidescape. We've, we've, we've

962
00:58:34,055 --> 00:58:37,735
Speaker 1:  lost Neli and Lossless Audio, my man. Come

963
00:58:37,835 --> 00:58:41,015
Speaker 1:  on. It's just a $15,000 initiative.

964
00:58:43,245 --> 00:58:45,855
Speaker 1:  Look, I love this for you. All right, we gotta take one more break and then

965
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,815
Speaker 1:  we got two more categories to do. We'll be right

966
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:20,105
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. We're five categories in. We got two more to go. Quick

967
01:00:20,195 --> 01:00:23,705
Speaker 1:  recap before we finish. Jake has picked Tubi, Netflix,

968
01:00:24,135 --> 01:00:27,585
Speaker 1:  Hulu, Instagram Live for some reason, and PBS Passport,

969
01:00:29,015 --> 01:00:32,585
Speaker 1:  some choices in there. Neli has picked TikTok Max

970
01:00:32,645 --> 01:00:36,545
Speaker 1:  Disney Plus NFL Sunday Ticket and Kaleidescape and

971
01:00:36,545 --> 01:00:39,785
Speaker 1:  has ceased paying attention to this podcast since he picked Kaleidoscope.

972
01:00:39,785 --> 01:00:43,665
Speaker 1:  I've done everything I need to do. Neli is finished and I have

973
01:00:43,695 --> 01:00:47,585
Speaker 1:  Peacock, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube Premium YouTube TV, and

974
01:00:47,785 --> 01:00:50,585
Speaker 1:  Stranger Things season five. We have two more categories each. Jake, you're

975
01:00:50,585 --> 01:00:50,705
Speaker 1:  up.

976
01:00:50,705 --> 01:00:54,585
Speaker 8:  Alright guys, it's gonna be a stressful year. We all need something to

977
01:00:54,615 --> 01:00:58,105
Speaker 8:  kind of chill out. Relax too. I also note that,

978
01:00:59,285 --> 01:01:02,385
Speaker 8:  you know, we're talking about video here, but I don't know what this does

979
01:01:02,405 --> 01:01:05,505
Speaker 8:  for our, our ability to listen to music. So I've been thinking about that.

980
01:01:07,045 --> 01:01:10,725
Speaker 8:  I don't have YouTube, so I'm gonna grab LoFi, Girl. Oh,

981
01:01:10,825 --> 01:01:12,085
Speaker 8:  listen. All right.

982
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:12,405
Speaker 1:  Lock that

983
01:01:12,565 --> 01:01:16,445
Speaker 8:  In. All right. While the world is burning, whoa. I'm gonna be in my

984
01:01:16,445 --> 01:01:19,965
Speaker 8:  bedroom studying little scarf around my neck,

985
01:01:20,435 --> 01:01:23,925
Speaker 8:  just sort of zenning out. I think this is gonna be a good one for 2025.

986
01:01:24,795 --> 01:01:28,485
Speaker 1:  It's a strong pick, actually. 'cause if, if, if the shtick here is, these

987
01:01:28,485 --> 01:01:31,365
Speaker 1:  are the only things you're allowed to consume this year,

988
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:35,395
Speaker 1:  you do need that. That's a, that's a strong pick. I like that for you.

989
01:01:35,675 --> 01:01:39,445
Speaker 8:  I think it's not covered by anything else that I've got. You know, it, it's

990
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:43,325
Speaker 8:  providing I think a very distinct surface. So, yeah. I, I

991
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:44,205
Speaker 8:  feel good about LoFi Girl.

992
01:01:44,205 --> 01:01:47,645
Speaker 1:  Which LoFi Girl Station do you listen to? There's like three or four of 'em

993
01:01:47,645 --> 01:01:47,765
Speaker 1:  now.

994
01:01:49,135 --> 01:01:52,445
Speaker 8:  We're just gonna go with the main for this pick. Okay. I I, I'm be honest,

995
01:01:52,545 --> 01:01:53,605
Speaker 8:  I'm not a c you can have

996
01:01:53,605 --> 01:01:56,005
Speaker 1:  The whole cha I'll give you the whole channel. I'm just curious which one

997
01:01:56,005 --> 01:01:56,525
Speaker 1:  you listen to,

998
01:01:58,235 --> 01:02:02,205
Speaker 8:  Whichever one comes up. I mean, I, I'm gonna be honest, not personally a

999
01:02:02,205 --> 01:02:05,525
Speaker 8:  big LoFi Girl listener, which maybe defeats the purpose of this draft, but

1000
01:02:05,945 --> 01:02:09,165
Speaker 8:  I'm trying to think holistically here. Right? Sure. I wanna get some music

1001
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:13,205
Speaker 8:  in. This is, I think the single hottest music channel

1002
01:02:13,505 --> 01:02:17,485
Speaker 8:  on streaming services that I know of. I don't think I can pick the

1003
01:02:17,485 --> 01:02:18,405
Speaker 8:  entire, like

1004
01:02:20,075 --> 01:02:23,485
Speaker 8:  channel for God. Does it even exist anymore? What was the

1005
01:02:23,645 --> 01:02:25,685
Speaker 8:  YouTube music video service?

1006
01:02:26,635 --> 01:02:26,925
Speaker 1:  Vivo.

1007
01:02:27,395 --> 01:02:29,045
Speaker 8:  Vivo. Yeah, that was, It is vi Yeah,

1008
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:30,965
Speaker 1:  They broke it up into individual artists. Yeah. If you would

1009
01:02:30,965 --> 01:02:34,165
Speaker 8:  Have to pick like Billy Eish vivo, I'm not, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Billy

1010
01:02:34,165 --> 01:02:37,285
Speaker 8:  Eilish. Billy E's YouTube channel is not a bad pick.

1011
01:02:38,845 --> 01:02:42,765
Speaker 8:  Probably could just go with that. No LoFi Girl. Listen,

1012
01:02:42,955 --> 01:02:46,165
Speaker 8:  it's not necessarily my constant jam, which maybe

1013
01:02:46,835 --> 01:02:50,685
Speaker 8:  defeats the purpose of this pick, but It is. I I I think It is

1014
01:02:51,065 --> 01:02:53,565
Speaker 8:  the right tone for 2025. I

1015
01:02:53,565 --> 01:02:53,845
Speaker 1:  Like it.

1016
01:02:53,905 --> 01:02:56,045
Speaker 8:  That's, that's why I'm locking it in. I support

1017
01:02:56,245 --> 01:02:58,885
Speaker 1:  It. I also, for anyone who spends all of their time on the regular

1018
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:03,565
Speaker 1:  Lofi channel, which is very good, the, the synth wave channel

1019
01:03:04,235 --> 01:03:07,125
Speaker 1:  also very good. Not nearly as popular. I'm looking at it now. It's like a

1020
01:03:07,125 --> 01:03:10,765
Speaker 1:  10th as many people on the channel right now. But it's called Synth Wave

1021
01:03:10,765 --> 01:03:14,205
Speaker 1:  Radio on LoFi Girl. It's very good. Highly recommend. There's also a jazz

1022
01:03:14,505 --> 01:03:18,125
Speaker 1:  one that I'm not nearly cool enough to listen to, but Jake, you could be,

1023
01:03:18,125 --> 01:03:20,165
Speaker 1:  you wear good sweaters. You could, you could listen to jazz.

1024
01:03:20,165 --> 01:03:23,565
Speaker 8:  Listen, now that I have lo-fi channel, I'll find out. I

1025
01:03:23,565 --> 01:03:26,725
Speaker 1:  Love this for you. All right, NELI, what do you got? I'm realizing that I

1026
01:03:26,725 --> 01:03:30,645
Speaker 1:  made an error and that I did not pick quite escape for every one of

1027
01:03:30,645 --> 01:03:30,805
Speaker 1:  these.

1028
01:03:32,945 --> 01:03:36,545
Speaker 1:  So for content, could I have picked just NFL

1029
01:03:37,725 --> 01:03:41,525
Speaker 1:  and gotten the out? No. Okay.

1030
01:03:42,255 --> 01:03:46,045
Speaker 1:  Could I have picked like Reddit slash NFL live streams

1031
01:03:46,065 --> 01:03:49,445
Speaker 1:  and gotten the out Can I pick that for Wild Card?

1032
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:51,325
Speaker 8:  Yeah.

1033
01:03:51,585 --> 01:03:54,925
Speaker 1:  You see what I'm saying? Interesting. Because I made a very important pick

1034
01:03:54,945 --> 01:03:58,125
Speaker 1:  for live and I'm thinking, oh, I could've,

1035
01:03:59,005 --> 01:04:02,685
Speaker 1:  I might, there's only one reason I needed it. I'm gonna say no because I

1036
01:04:02,685 --> 01:04:06,365
Speaker 1:  think LoFi Girl qualifies as more or less a piece of content.

1037
01:04:07,105 --> 01:04:10,555
Speaker 1:  Like I think if you were to say under content, you're gonna pick the Super

1038
01:04:10,585 --> 01:04:14,575
Speaker 1:  Bowl, I'd give you the Super Bowl, but I don't think the NFL

1039
01:04:14,645 --> 01:04:18,405
Speaker 1:  sees. I think it's too big. Too big. Yeah. And

1040
01:04:18,465 --> 01:04:21,245
Speaker 1:  the collected catalog of LoFi Girl is not too

1041
01:04:21,245 --> 01:04:24,245
Speaker 8:  Big. It it, that's a nonstop stream. That thing doesn't, she doesn't sleep.

1042
01:04:24,995 --> 01:04:28,725
Speaker 1:  Sometimes she gets a murder. Apparently. From what I understand, there's

1043
01:04:28,725 --> 01:04:30,125
Speaker 1:  some sort of like la situation.

1044
01:04:30,125 --> 01:04:32,765
Speaker 8:  I, I dunno about the, the meta story of the Fight Girl.

1045
01:04:32,815 --> 01:04:35,485
Speaker 1:  Every now and again, she disappears and people have to do a quest. It's like

1046
01:04:35,485 --> 01:04:35,885
Speaker 1:  a thing. Oh,

1047
01:04:36,515 --> 01:04:39,445
Speaker 8:  This usually a brand. I've got gamification built in here too.

1048
01:04:39,685 --> 01:04:43,325
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Oh yeah. The lore is so much deeper than, you know, Jake. So the one

1049
01:04:43,325 --> 01:04:47,045
Speaker 1:  thing I don't really have here is any kind of news content. True.

1050
01:04:48,185 --> 01:04:52,125
Speaker 1:  Except for whatever extremely weird version of CNN they run

1051
01:04:52,125 --> 01:04:55,845
Speaker 1:  on Max, which It is not worth watching. 'cause it's not

1052
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:59,525
Speaker 1:  actually CNN. Yeah. It's like, what if this was worse?

1053
01:04:59,885 --> 01:05:03,605
Speaker 1:  You're like, I don't want this, so here's what I'm picking. I'm gonna throw

1054
01:05:03,605 --> 01:05:06,795
Speaker 1:  it. I content I'm gonna throw,

1055
01:05:08,595 --> 01:05:11,515
Speaker 1:  I gotta put a news service here. Right. That's what you need live television

1056
01:05:11,515 --> 01:05:15,355
Speaker 1:  for, especially in, in this moment. And I feel like the

1057
01:05:15,355 --> 01:05:19,045
Speaker 1:  regular cable news channels have just become weird podcasts

1058
01:05:19,075 --> 01:05:22,755
Speaker 1:  unto themselves. So if I'm gonna pick a weird news podcast,

1059
01:05:23,295 --> 01:05:27,075
Speaker 1:  I'm picking my pals at CNBC and that's, I'm just putting that here in content.

1060
01:05:27,545 --> 01:05:31,155
Speaker 1:  Okay. Because if if line's gonna go down Yeah. And I'm gonna panic with a

1061
01:05:31,155 --> 01:05:34,955
Speaker 1:  bunch of weirdos. It's, it's my buddies. Okay. So that's my, my content.

1062
01:05:35,755 --> 01:05:39,495
Speaker 1:  I like, I'm glad we got a podcast in here. Yeah. Is It, is it a CNBC

1063
01:05:39,925 --> 01:05:43,855
Speaker 1:  like podcast stream? Like what? See the CNBC, literally,

1064
01:05:43,915 --> 01:05:47,775
Speaker 1:  if you go onto their homepage right now, there's a button that says

1065
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:50,175
Speaker 1:  Watch Live Stream, which is an incredible button for a cable channel to have.

1066
01:05:50,395 --> 01:05:53,455
Speaker 1:  And then it says prefer audio, because I think they've realized

1067
01:05:54,725 --> 01:05:58,575
Speaker 1:  that It is just a weird podcast about a chart. Like what does

1068
01:05:58,765 --> 01:06:02,455
Speaker 1:  CNBC make every day? A podcast about a chart. Yeah. The hosts come and go,

1069
01:06:02,715 --> 01:06:05,855
Speaker 1:  but they're making a podcast about a chart. Sure. And so there's a button

1070
01:06:05,855 --> 01:06:08,415
Speaker 1:  where you can just listen to it. Okay. And they put out all the shows as

1071
01:06:08,415 --> 01:06:11,095
Speaker 1:  podcasts and mirror. I don't know if any of this is working strategically

1072
01:06:11,195 --> 01:06:15,095
Speaker 1:  and obviously they're being spun out of Comcast into their own.

1073
01:06:15,485 --> 01:06:19,135
Speaker 1:  They're gonna live whatever weird life in a company called literally Spinco.

1074
01:06:19,285 --> 01:06:22,735
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I dunno if It is gonna happen, but I do know that if I wanna listen

1075
01:06:22,735 --> 01:06:26,695
Speaker 1:  to people panic about Line go down this, it, I would, I prefer that over

1076
01:06:26,715 --> 01:06:30,615
Speaker 1:  the general interest news channels. I can get that from my

1077
01:06:30,615 --> 01:06:32,655
Speaker 1:  bastardized CNN and Max. You see what I'm saying?

1078
01:06:35,005 --> 01:06:38,895
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I like it. And I think CNBC is like, it's gotta be weird to program

1079
01:06:39,055 --> 01:06:41,895
Speaker 1:  a thing that, you know, many of your viewers are gonna watch with no sound.

1080
01:06:42,115 --> 01:06:45,655
Speaker 1:  And many of your viewers are only gonna listen to. It's like you, you, you,

1081
01:06:45,655 --> 01:06:49,575
Speaker 1:  like very few people seem to actively sit and listen and look at cable tv.

1082
01:06:49,645 --> 01:06:53,335
Speaker 1:  They all, it's one or the other. It's like you're in an airport with no sound.

1083
01:06:53,595 --> 01:06:56,895
Speaker 1:  Oh, you put audio stream here. I'm just saying. Well, yeah, you can have

1084
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:59,935
Speaker 1:  the live stream. I don't care. You don't have live stream nbc. Yeah. My my

1085
01:06:59,935 --> 01:07:03,175
Speaker 1:  point is, all cable news podcasts are now weird podcasts.

1086
01:07:03,805 --> 01:07:07,495
Speaker 1:  Like, if you just look, if you look at what we do every week, like here's

1087
01:07:07,495 --> 01:07:10,935
Speaker 1:  some people talking to each other for a while about stuff and you like, watch

1088
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:14,935
Speaker 1:  any major cable news. They're like, here's 35 people

1089
01:07:15,075 --> 01:07:18,975
Speaker 1:  in a grid talking about stuff. And it's just a podcast and

1090
01:07:18,975 --> 01:07:22,095
Speaker 1:  like everything is converging on this form. But you do need the like

1091
01:07:22,765 --> 01:07:26,095
Speaker 1:  live reactive to news in your content mix.

1092
01:07:26,835 --> 01:07:29,815
Speaker 1:  We need more charts on The Vergecast is, is what I'm hearing here, A podcast

1093
01:07:29,905 --> 01:07:33,655
Speaker 1:  about Chart, A live podcast where we panic about a chart is like, that's,

1094
01:07:33,835 --> 01:07:37,695
Speaker 1:  that's cable news in 2025. I'm, I'm ready for it. All right. That's a good

1095
01:07:37,695 --> 01:07:41,615
Speaker 1:  one. I will be watching as little news as possible over the rest of this

1096
01:07:41,615 --> 01:07:44,935
Speaker 1:  year. So I will, I will skip on that one. All right. I'm up next.

1097
01:07:46,015 --> 01:07:49,535
Speaker 1:  I have Niche and Wild Card left. I think I'm gonna pick

1098
01:07:49,805 --> 01:07:53,295
Speaker 1:  Wild Card and I'm gonna go Paramount Plus

1099
01:07:53,925 --> 01:07:57,615
Speaker 1:  with, with great sadness and trepidation, but I need

1100
01:07:57,615 --> 01:08:01,495
Speaker 1:  sports and Paramount Plus has a lot of very good sports.

1101
01:08:01,495 --> 01:08:05,255
Speaker 1:  Paramount Plus is how I watch March Madness. It's how I watch

1102
01:08:05,275 --> 01:08:09,055
Speaker 1:  the Masters. It's how I watch Champions League soccer. It is like, there's

1103
01:08:09,055 --> 01:08:12,895
Speaker 1:  just this like steady drumbeat of very important sports to me on CBS that

1104
01:08:12,935 --> 01:08:16,805
Speaker 1:  I can only get through Paramount Plus. And I don't love giving them

1105
01:08:16,805 --> 01:08:20,325
Speaker 1:  my money because it's not a good service. Other times. Although they do also

1106
01:08:20,325 --> 01:08:22,085
Speaker 1:  have the Mission Impossible movies, so that

1107
01:08:22,085 --> 01:08:24,685
Speaker 8:  Helps. That's gonna be big this year. They got another one coming up. You're

1108
01:08:24,685 --> 01:08:27,645
Speaker 8:  gonna have a a rewatch marathon. I think there's something there. Yeah.

1109
01:08:27,745 --> 01:08:29,085
Speaker 1:  So I'm, I'm taking Paramount Plus,

1110
01:08:31,365 --> 01:08:34,905
Speaker 1:  but like I will probably cancel it three separate times

1111
01:08:35,135 --> 01:08:38,505
Speaker 1:  over the course of this year. That's right. But I wanna have it available

1112
01:08:38,525 --> 01:08:42,095
Speaker 1:  to me also. This is the Alex Kranz memorial pick

1113
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:42,735
Speaker 8:  And,

1114
01:10:57,625 --> 01:11:01,345
Speaker 1:  content out there that you can get with your library card. Please don't close

1115
01:11:01,405 --> 01:11:02,265
Speaker 1:  all of our libraries.

1116
01:11:02,265 --> 01:11:03,705
Speaker 8:  Support your libraries people. That's

1117
01:11:03,705 --> 01:11:06,505
Speaker 1:  A good pick. I think Kanopy has come up before, but I don't think anyone

1118
01:11:06,505 --> 01:11:08,935
Speaker 1:  has ever picked it. So you, you've

1119
01:12:47,915 --> 01:12:51,765
Speaker 1:  live from F1 tv. That's how I prefer to experience this sport. It's like,

1120
01:12:51,915 --> 01:12:54,045
Speaker 1:  okay, so I'm gonna be taking a nap at home.

1121
01:12:55,795 --> 01:12:59,205
Speaker 1:  It's very good, strong correlation, by the way, between people who love video

1122
01:12:59,205 --> 01:13:03,165
Speaker 1:  games and F1 because they're just, they're just doing video

1123
01:13:03,165 --> 01:13:06,805
Speaker 1:  games stuff like, they're just like min maxing, like European boys. Yeah,

1124
01:13:06,805 --> 01:13:10,525
Speaker 1:  I see that. It's very good. The Polygon. People love F1. It's a, it's, they're

1125
01:13:10,525 --> 01:13:12,325
Speaker 1:  always like, It is a spreadsheet game. It's a lot of,

1126
01:13:14,115 --> 01:13:17,765
Speaker 1:  it's, It is very much, It is like the nerdiest sport you could possibly imagine.

1127
01:13:17,785 --> 01:13:21,765
Speaker 1:  In all. It's all of the best ways. Well, this sucks 'cause now I don't know

1128
01:13:21,765 --> 01:13:22,485
Speaker 1:  what I'm gonna pick.

1129
01:13:24,925 --> 01:13:28,605
Speaker 1:  I wanna say, by the way, this officially means Apple TV is going to go

1130
01:13:28,805 --> 01:13:31,445
Speaker 1:  undrafted. I was, I was wondering,

1131
01:13:33,005 --> 01:13:36,805
Speaker 1:  I thought about taking it in Wild Card, but I think I need, I need

1132
01:13:36,955 --> 01:13:39,805
Speaker 1:  like Severances already happened, so like I'm good on Apple TV for a while.

1133
01:13:40,145 --> 01:13:41,725
Speaker 1:  Did anything happen, David,

1134
01:13:43,345 --> 01:13:44,525
Speaker 1:  I'm not doing this with you again.

1135
01:13:46,715 --> 01:13:50,285
Speaker 1:  Same, same conversation about White Lotus, by the way. It seems, it appears

1136
01:13:50,285 --> 01:13:53,725
Speaker 1:  Netflix has issued rules where everyone just has to be doing like Boldfaced

1137
01:13:53,815 --> 01:13:57,605
Speaker 1:  Exposition and Apple and Max have been like,

1138
01:13:57,755 --> 01:14:01,645
Speaker 1:  nothing happens for three episodes in the middle. But it's beautiful so people

1139
01:14:01,645 --> 01:14:05,125
Speaker 1:  can look at their phones. Yeah, yeah. Like huge gorgeous

1140
01:14:05,125 --> 01:14:08,685
Speaker 1:  establishing shots. The end. Yeah. End of episode.

1141
01:14:08,875 --> 01:14:12,285
Speaker 1:  Will this monkey murder someone? No, actually

1142
01:14:12,395 --> 01:14:15,425
Speaker 1:  nothing. Nothing will happened. Okay.

1143
01:14:17,295 --> 01:14:20,825
Speaker 1:  Also ESPN plus undrafted. Interesting. And I think

1144
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:24,345
Speaker 1:  ESPN Plus doesn't count as a streaming service. That feels too mainstream.

1145
01:14:24,345 --> 01:14:27,875
Speaker 1:  Right? I don't think I can get away with that. I'm gonna take BritBox

1146
01:14:29,615 --> 01:14:32,795
Speaker 1:  as mine. BritBox is just an

1147
01:14:33,155 --> 01:14:37,115
Speaker 1:  unbelievable repository of, I believe BBC specific

1148
01:14:37,665 --> 01:14:38,595
Speaker 1:  British content.

1149
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:44,215
Speaker 1:  A lot of good stuff. Like, oh boy, do you want people like quietly

1150
01:14:44,215 --> 01:14:47,975
Speaker 1:  solving murders in beautiful Countrysides BritBox has

1151
01:14:48,175 --> 01:14:51,895
Speaker 1:  you covered forever. A lot of good house shows on

1152
01:14:51,925 --> 01:14:55,775
Speaker 1:  BritBox. But really I'm taking it because I think

1153
01:14:56,195 --> 01:14:59,975
Speaker 1:  in, in a, in a time where people are looking for less America

1154
01:15:00,155 --> 01:15:04,095
Speaker 1:  in their lives, we're all going British. It's just, it's just gonna be me

1155
01:15:04,095 --> 01:15:08,055
Speaker 1:  and my BritBox homies just checking it out. Is that what we're

1156
01:15:08,055 --> 01:15:11,055
Speaker 1:  doing? That's what it's gonna be. That's the bet I'm making. I feel like

1157
01:15:11,055 --> 01:15:12,495
Speaker 1:  you ought to pick a Russian streaming

1158
01:15:12,495 --> 01:15:13,935
Speaker 8:  Service of it. We want ing again,

1159
01:15:15,005 --> 01:15:18,815
Speaker 1:  Like what's going on over there? Is it cool? Because it seems like we ought

1160
01:15:18,815 --> 01:15:19,055
Speaker 1:  to know.

1161
01:15:20,885 --> 01:15:23,895
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I'm just looking at this now. I, there's a show called Douglas is Canceled

1162
01:15:23,965 --> 01:15:25,255
Speaker 1:  that I think I can watch

1163
01:15:25,565 --> 01:15:27,975
Speaker 8:  Anytime people tell me what they're watching on BritBox

1164
01:15:29,265 --> 01:15:33,215
Speaker 8:  truly just shows I've never known existed. I'm, I'm sure they're

1165
01:15:33,215 --> 01:15:35,695
Speaker 8:  delightful, but it's just, it's it's very goofy names.

1166
01:15:37,525 --> 01:15:40,735
Speaker 8:  They've been on for, for a decade. I've just never heard of them.

1167
01:15:40,885 --> 01:15:44,295
Speaker 1:  Jake, there's a show on here called Gardener's World that I'm pretty excited

1168
01:15:44,295 --> 01:15:47,655
Speaker 8:  About. Oh, you know what? That is a hit though. Gardner's World is, is the

1169
01:15:47,655 --> 01:15:48,335
Speaker 8:  number one

1170
01:15:49,965 --> 01:15:52,215
Speaker 8:  worldwide gardening competition series.

1171
01:15:52,945 --> 01:15:55,975
Speaker 1:  Monty and the team are back full of the best practical tips and advice for

1172
01:15:55,975 --> 01:15:59,775
Speaker 1:  gardeners. Five seasons. Yeah, let's go. This is the

1173
01:15:59,885 --> 01:16:01,015
Speaker 1:  cozy TV I'm looking for.

1174
01:16:01,585 --> 01:16:05,375
Speaker 8:  There there is a big contract negotiation issue with Monty, so that actually

1175
01:16:05,395 --> 01:16:06,255
Speaker 8:  was a big deal.

1176
01:16:06,665 --> 01:16:09,015
Speaker 1:  Monty actually got replaced in season three. Silently.

1177
01:16:10,845 --> 01:16:14,735
Speaker 1:  Look, David, extremely weird pick. That's what I tell you. Not good about

1178
01:16:14,735 --> 01:16:17,855
Speaker 1:  it. We really, really fizzled out here at the end where David just started

1179
01:16:17,855 --> 01:16:21,455
Speaker 1:  googling cool streaming services and realized that both

1180
01:16:21,675 --> 01:16:24,375
Speaker 1:  Kanopy and and LoFi Girl were taken

1181
01:16:24,995 --> 01:16:28,455
Speaker 8:  In person. You like gave a very solemn sigh after you did

1182
01:16:30,325 --> 01:16:34,135
Speaker 1:  Like, just like scoop it up the bottom of the barrel. Alright, that's fine.

1183
01:16:34,135 --> 01:16:37,495
Speaker 1:  I can, yeah, you, you picked this over Apple TV plus I think that's really

1184
01:16:37,495 --> 01:16:41,335
Speaker 1:  saying something. Apple TV plus doesn't, doesn't count in Niche. If I, if

1185
01:16:41,335 --> 01:16:45,215
Speaker 1:  I had truly, if I had known you were gonna pick F1 tv, I would've done

1186
01:16:45,215 --> 01:16:49,135
Speaker 1:  it backwards and then I would've had a real Paramount Plus

1187
01:16:49,135 --> 01:16:53,095
Speaker 1:  versus Apple TV plus debate to have. But I I,

1188
01:16:53,575 --> 01:16:56,975
Speaker 1:  I played myself. Only one of those has both Top Gun movies. David,

1189
01:16:57,575 --> 01:17:00,735
Speaker 1:  it's not a debate. I don't know what you're talking about. Ted Lasso Season

1190
01:17:00,735 --> 01:17:04,455
Speaker 1:  four is coming someday in the future. Yeah. Do you think he's gonna be optimistic?

1191
01:17:08,015 --> 01:17:11,445
Speaker 1:  Listen, do I every once in a while tap a wall and say believe to myself?

1192
01:17:11,445 --> 01:17:15,285
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I do. This is who I'm, do I walk into a bars and just

1193
01:17:15,395 --> 01:17:18,485
Speaker 1:  blow people out of the water at darts every couple days? Yeah. That's why.

1194
01:17:18,485 --> 01:17:20,565
Speaker 1:  That's, that's be curious. Not judgemental. Nehi.

1195
01:17:24,025 --> 01:17:28,005
Speaker 1:  All right. To recap the 2025 Vergecast Streaming Draft,

1196
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:32,325
Speaker 1:  Jake in Cheap, you picked Tubi in awards. You picked

1197
01:17:32,325 --> 01:17:35,845
Speaker 1:  Netflix in 4K, you picked Hulu in Live. Let's

1198
01:17:35,845 --> 01:17:37,565
Speaker 8:  Pause there, let's pause there. I

1199
01:17:37,565 --> 01:17:38,445
Speaker 1:  Have a draft and a

1200
01:17:38,445 --> 01:17:40,005
Speaker 8:  Really winning selection right there

1201
01:17:40,785 --> 01:17:43,925
Speaker 1:  In live. You picked Instagram Live. What? That's choice. Niche. Niche. You

1202
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:47,805
Speaker 1:  picked PBS Passport in Content. You picked LoFi Girl and in

1203
01:17:47,805 --> 01:17:51,405
Speaker 1:  Wild Card you picked Kanopy. I think most of those are

1204
01:17:51,505 --> 01:17:55,365
Speaker 1:  strong picks. David described this as, as very

1205
01:17:55,565 --> 01:17:58,485
Speaker 1:  Brooklyn. I would describe this as guy who insists they don't watch tv.

1206
01:17:59,305 --> 01:18:02,925
Speaker 8:  No, this is, this is straight, this is accurate. I'm, this is the

1207
01:18:03,325 --> 01:18:07,125
Speaker 8:  cheapest slate. Right? I'm paying for two of these PBS Passport.

1208
01:18:07,145 --> 01:18:09,765
Speaker 8:  You just make a donation like once,

1209
01:18:10,355 --> 01:18:14,205
Speaker 1:  Like, I mean, it's good. I I'm not saying I wasn't the kid who

1210
01:18:14,205 --> 01:18:17,325
Speaker 1:  didn't have the tv, but there's a real vibe here.

1211
01:18:18,465 --> 01:18:21,645
Speaker 8:  No, that's, that's completely right. I, I wanna watch a bunch of old movies

1212
01:18:21,645 --> 01:18:25,445
Speaker 8:  that nobody else cares about that are only available with ads

1213
01:18:25,465 --> 01:18:27,565
Speaker 8:  on Tubi. 'cause nobody else wanted to pay for them.

1214
01:18:29,265 --> 01:18:32,245
Speaker 8:  I'm going to the library because it's the only place you can check out, you

1215
01:18:32,245 --> 01:18:36,085
Speaker 8:  know, the, the Peter Greenaway movies I wanna watch and then I don't know,

1216
01:18:36,225 --> 01:18:39,245
Speaker 8:  I'm not in touch culturally, and so I'm like, what's happening? Let's check

1217
01:18:39,245 --> 01:18:39,925
Speaker 8:  Instagram Live.

1218
01:18:40,805 --> 01:18:44,325
Speaker 1:  I just feel like you've also won the unofficial,

1219
01:18:45,185 --> 01:18:48,805
Speaker 1:  how many of these companies will send me a tote bag race

1220
01:18:49,345 --> 01:18:53,085
Speaker 1:  in, in pretty handly? Yeah. You get a LoFi Girl tote bag. That's the move.

1221
01:18:53,085 --> 01:18:56,645
Speaker 1:  There we go. Then you're the winner. All right, so Neli in Cheap, you pick

1222
01:18:56,705 --> 01:19:00,685
Speaker 1:  TikTok in awards, you pick Max in 4K, you picked Disney

1223
01:19:00,715 --> 01:19:04,685
Speaker 1:  Plus in Live, you picked Sunday Ticket In Niche, you picked the Kaleido Escape

1224
01:19:05,025 --> 01:19:08,485
Speaker 1:  in Content. You picked CNBC and in Wild Card you picked F1 tv.

1225
01:19:08,835 --> 01:19:11,285
Speaker 1:  This is a real like content monster lineup.

1226
01:19:11,555 --> 01:19:12,205
Speaker 8:  Yeah, it's strong.

1227
01:19:12,405 --> 01:19:16,205
Speaker 1:  I feel like I've outed myself as a dad in the worst possible way. This

1228
01:19:16,555 --> 01:19:16,845
Speaker 1:  this,

1229
01:19:17,235 --> 01:19:21,085
Speaker 8:  This is like, you have five TVs on a wall and they've all got something

1230
01:19:21,085 --> 01:19:21,365
Speaker 8:  going

1231
01:19:21,365 --> 01:19:25,165
Speaker 1:  On. Yes. Yeah. It's, it's a lot. And I, yeah,

1232
01:19:25,405 --> 01:19:28,885
Speaker 1:  I I needed one cool one and I didn't pick one. Instead I picked CNAC,

1233
01:19:30,305 --> 01:19:31,165
Speaker 1:  but I'm okay with it.

1234
01:19:31,485 --> 01:19:33,525
Speaker 8:  F one's up there. F one's cool. F1 is cool.

1235
01:19:33,555 --> 01:19:37,525
Speaker 1:  Yeah, It is. And it's way, you're like, I'm a nerd

1236
01:19:37,525 --> 01:19:41,165
Speaker 1:  who watches cars at three in the morning. That's me. It's so deeply me, but

1237
01:19:41,165 --> 01:19:44,245
Speaker 1:  yeah. Well, and you have TikTok, so you still get truck trucks jumping over

1238
01:19:44,245 --> 01:19:47,645
Speaker 1:  stuff. So I think, I think you've, you've represented yourself fairly accurately

1239
01:19:47,645 --> 01:19:51,445
Speaker 1:  here. Yeah. As a dad. Yeah. That's, that's, that's my choice.

1240
01:19:51,465 --> 01:19:55,365
Speaker 1:  And I have a cloud escape server, which is sick. I've won on strength of

1241
01:19:55,365 --> 01:19:59,005
Speaker 1:  streaming quality alone in terms of like number of

1242
01:19:59,115 --> 01:20:03,045
Speaker 1:  bits delivered to the house. You've won and it's not close. No question

1243
01:20:03,045 --> 01:20:06,805
Speaker 1:  about that. It's so many. You need an $11,000 server

1244
01:20:06,835 --> 01:20:10,445
Speaker 1:  just to download them overnight. Do you understand what I'm saying?

1245
01:20:10,595 --> 01:20:13,845
Speaker 1:  They, you know, it pre downloads a bunch of movies so you can buy them locally

1246
01:20:13,865 --> 01:20:14,925
Speaker 1:  and watch them right away.

1247
01:20:15,605 --> 01:20:18,535
Speaker 8:  They're just assuming you're gonna give them another 200 bucks every week.

1248
01:20:18,845 --> 01:20:22,055
Speaker 1:  Yeah. They're just like, we're just gonna preload your Terra Prime

1249
01:20:22,795 --> 01:20:24,975
Speaker 1:  so you're ready to go. That's not bad. That's why you need the server in

1250
01:20:24,975 --> 01:20:25,495
Speaker 1:  the basement.

1251
01:20:25,635 --> 01:20:26,335
Speaker 8:  That's good service.

1252
01:20:26,845 --> 01:20:30,535
Speaker 1:  Look, if you're out there, I'm, I'm guessing it's Steve Kaleidescape.

1253
01:20:30,965 --> 01:20:34,495
Speaker 1:  Just gimme a call. Let's, let's work something out. I give it like 12 days

1254
01:20:34,495 --> 01:20:37,535
Speaker 1:  before you reappear on this show. So lemme tell you what I've been up to.

1255
01:20:39,375 --> 01:20:43,335
Speaker 1:  All right. And then my picks were in Cheap. I picked Peacock in awards. I

1256
01:20:43,335 --> 01:20:46,935
Speaker 1:  picked Amazon Prime in 4K. I picked YouTube Premium Live,

1257
01:20:46,935 --> 01:20:50,775
Speaker 1:  YouTube TV Niche, BritBox content, Stranger Things

1258
01:20:50,775 --> 01:20:54,135
Speaker 1:  Season five and Wild Card Paramount Plus I would call this the like

1259
01:20:54,985 --> 01:20:58,895
Speaker 1:  basic parentheses derogatory set of picks. Yeah. This is David is

1260
01:20:58,895 --> 01:21:02,855
Speaker 1:  passed out in the aisle of Best Buy. Like stuff is just happening to you

1261
01:21:03,075 --> 01:21:05,335
Speaker 1:  and you don't know why. There, there's

1262
01:21:05,335 --> 01:21:08,895
Speaker 8:  A real like beat your selection to the streaming. I don't want, I don't mean

1263
01:21:08,895 --> 01:21:11,695
Speaker 8:  to, to criticize you as a person, David, you're great. But

1264
01:21:11,835 --> 01:21:15,655
Speaker 1:  No, I'm looking at this and I'm like, no, this is pure, just like the

1265
01:21:15,705 --> 01:21:19,095
Speaker 1:  algorithms get to decide. Like I don't, I don't care what I watch. Just put

1266
01:21:19,095 --> 01:21:21,895
Speaker 1:  something on is like the energy I'm getting from my picks here.

1267
01:21:21,895 --> 01:21:25,655
Speaker 8:  There's an argument that YouTube alone tops everything else.

1268
01:21:26,005 --> 01:21:29,895
Speaker 8:  Like if, if you have YouTube, you can, you have access to the entire world

1269
01:21:29,895 --> 01:21:30,895
Speaker 8:  of content in some ways.

1270
01:21:31,415 --> 01:21:35,015
Speaker 1:  Frankly, the con the, the combo of YouTube Premium and Amazon Prime video,

1271
01:21:35,325 --> 01:21:38,695
Speaker 1:  like who is going to run out of content last? It's me by

1272
01:21:40,415 --> 01:21:44,255
Speaker 1:  Lifetimes. So I'm good on that. Yeah. But like, I don't know,

1273
01:21:44,255 --> 01:21:48,175
Speaker 1:  the ceiling's pretty low on David's picks over here. The

1274
01:21:48,175 --> 01:21:52,135
Speaker 1:  combo platter of Peacock and Paramount Plus ending up on your board, but

1275
01:21:52,195 --> 01:21:56,135
Speaker 1:  not Apple TV plus is perfect. You're like, I

1276
01:21:56,135 --> 01:22:00,095
Speaker 1:  could have, but I did not choose the one that has won an

1277
01:22:00,095 --> 01:22:03,735
Speaker 1:  Oscar. Yeah, it's good. There's that. You do get all of the weird Jurassic

1278
01:22:03,735 --> 01:22:04,135
Speaker 1:  Park movies.

1279
01:22:05,995 --> 01:22:08,455
Speaker 1:  And I'm not saying that they weren't successful. They've made billions of

1280
01:22:08,455 --> 01:22:12,295
Speaker 1:  dollars. Super weird movies. Can you name the titles of any

1281
01:22:12,295 --> 01:22:14,735
Speaker 1:  of them? It happened again.

1282
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:20,415
Speaker 1:  Oh, no. More dinosaurs. Whoops. All right, we're done.

1283
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:24,295
Speaker 1:  We gotta get outta here. Tell us who you think won the draft.

1284
01:22:24,455 --> 01:22:27,255
Speaker 1:  I guess we have like a year to really figure this out, right? So like, maybe,

1285
01:22:27,255 --> 01:22:30,095
Speaker 1:  we'll, we'll ask a bunch of overtime, but we, we should, we should put a

1286
01:22:30,095 --> 01:22:33,055
Speaker 1:  poll in the, in the post on the site about who won the draft.

1287
01:22:34,005 --> 01:22:36,815
Speaker 1:  Spoiler alert. It's, it's me. I won the draft, but

1288
01:22:38,775 --> 01:22:41,655
Speaker 1:  I, I don't know, I don't know that any of us did great this year, but we'll

1289
01:22:41,655 --> 01:22:44,495
Speaker 1:  see. And we have 12 months to figure it out. Maybe TikTok will still be here

1290
01:22:44,875 --> 01:22:48,415
Speaker 1:  and maybe Instagram Live will have taken over the internet. We'll see, I

1291
01:22:48,415 --> 01:22:51,535
Speaker 1:  just feel like I, my choices are very good and like by rides in the winter,

1292
01:22:51,535 --> 01:22:54,335
Speaker 1:  but I'm also wearing a quarter zip, you know what I mean? It's like,

1293
01:22:55,885 --> 01:22:58,695
Speaker 1:  it's rough. Yeah, it's rough. Yeah. Like the, the net worth of your picks

1294
01:22:58,695 --> 01:23:00,975
Speaker 1:  is very high. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. That's what I, you know. Yeah.

1295
01:23:01,285 --> 01:23:02,935
Speaker 1:  It's like I have a golf sponsorship now.

1296
01:23:05,155 --> 01:23:08,885
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I won. I'm I'm saying I won as, but you know,

1297
01:23:09,185 --> 01:23:12,205
Speaker 1:  but you're sad about it. I'm caveating my own victory. Yeah. I'm saying I

1298
01:23:12,205 --> 01:23:15,445
Speaker 1:  could have won in a cooler way. Yeah. Alright, we gotta get outta here. Jake

1308
01:23:45,725 --> 01:23:49,405
Speaker 1:  it's like nuts that Disney Plus didn't go first. If you think I'm a lunatic

1309
01:23:49,405 --> 01:23:52,925
Speaker 1:  for picking BritBox, which I'm not, but if you think that I am,
