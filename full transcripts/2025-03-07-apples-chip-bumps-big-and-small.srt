Description: Apple's new gadgets this week were pretty minor updates, so of course we talk about them for a long time. Nilay and David are joined by The Verge's Jake Kastrenakes, and the three hosts discuss the latest iPad, iPad Air, MacBook Air, and Mac Studio. All three have... a lot of thoughts. After that, they run through some more tech news, including the Digg reboot, the end of Skype, VW's cheap new EV, and more. Finally, in the lightning round, they talk about the latest from DOGE and the Trump administration, Brendan Carr's latest assaults on free speech, and a smartphone that is mostly (but not entirely) a camera.

00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:38,685
Speaker 7:  Hello and welcome to our Chest, the flagship podcast with minor updates

3
00:01:38,795 --> 00:01:40,485
Speaker 7:  that do not support Apple Intelligence.

4
00:01:42,505 --> 00:01:46,445
Speaker 7:  If you think we can't make an hour and a half show about

5
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:49,805
Speaker 7:  the new iPad Air, I dunno what show you think you're listening to right now.

6
00:01:50,805 --> 00:01:54,205
Speaker 7:  'cause we we're gonna do it. We're gonna find a way. I'm ready. It's gonna

7
00:01:54,205 --> 00:01:58,085
Speaker 7:  be emotional. It's a winding road. Some of you'll cry, I

8
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:01,285
Speaker 7:  think some of you'll share. It's up to you to decide who you are, but

9
00:02:01,285 --> 00:02:03,085
Speaker 8:  You have to choose right now before we start at

10
00:02:03,085 --> 00:02:06,565
Speaker 7:  The top of the show. You gonna laugh or you gonna cry? What kind of, what

11
00:02:06,565 --> 00:02:09,165
Speaker 7:  kind of person you gonna be? I'm your friend Neli David Pierce here. Hello,

12
00:02:09,975 --> 00:02:11,505
Speaker 7:  Jake Castran is here.

13
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:15,585
Speaker 9:  Hey, good to be here in the actually very, very real control room

14
00:02:15,805 --> 00:02:17,465
Speaker 9:  as all of our video viewers can tell.

15
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:20,665
Speaker 7:  Yeah. What did you pick this background? What?

16
00:02:21,345 --> 00:02:25,105
Speaker 9:  I don't wanna give away the charade here, but this might be

17
00:02:25,905 --> 00:02:27,585
Speaker 9:  a controllable screen behind. I

18
00:02:27,585 --> 00:02:27,865
Speaker 8:  Love this.

19
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,425
Speaker 9:  This might not be real.

20
00:02:30,005 --> 00:02:33,465
Speaker 8:  Can I tell you something? So one of the first times I ever did a a like cable

21
00:02:33,685 --> 00:02:36,825
Speaker 8:  TV hit and you guys have both done this. So you know how they work, what

22
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:40,705
Speaker 8:  what what happens is they usher you into a teeny tiny room with a

23
00:02:40,705 --> 00:02:43,865
Speaker 8:  screen behind you and a camera and a light in front of you. And it is either

24
00:02:44,135 --> 00:02:47,705
Speaker 8:  zero or 700 degrees in that room. Yep. Depending on the day.

25
00:02:48,145 --> 00:02:51,305
Speaker 8:  And then you sit there and you do your thing and you go home. To discover

26
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:54,945
Speaker 8:  that I was not sitting in front of a window with like the beautiful

27
00:02:54,945 --> 00:02:58,145
Speaker 8:  New York City skyline behind me was like genuinely upsetting the first time

28
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:01,525
Speaker 8:  this ever happened to me. And I have, I have had angry feelings about virtual

29
00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:02,805
Speaker 8:  backgrounds ever since.

30
00:03:02,805 --> 00:03:06,565
Speaker 9:  Listen you guys, next week we're going to Times Square, we're recording this

31
00:03:06,565 --> 00:03:10,045
Speaker 9:  thing live. All of the backgrounds will be real. This is what I'm saying.

32
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:11,685
Speaker 9:  Elmo will come and harass us.

33
00:03:11,845 --> 00:03:15,245
Speaker 7:  We're gonna do TRL live like in the nineties. The first time I ever did came

34
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:18,005
Speaker 7:  when you said that you're kind of describing CNN I'm guessing. 'cause that

35
00:03:18,005 --> 00:03:18,085
Speaker 7:  was,

36
00:03:18,145 --> 00:03:19,165
Speaker 8:  It was CNN in fact.

37
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:23,125
Speaker 7:  Yeah. That because the tiny hot room, that's very much CNN. Yes,

38
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:27,565
Speaker 7:  I was, I was surprised not by the fact there was a green screen, which David,

39
00:03:27,765 --> 00:03:30,565
Speaker 7:  I I truly what I knew green

40
00:03:30,565 --> 00:03:31,125
Speaker 8:  Screens existed.

41
00:03:31,305 --> 00:03:33,205
Speaker 7:  You but that one, these are fancy

42
00:03:33,205 --> 00:03:34,245
Speaker 8:  Studios. They should have windows.

43
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:38,805
Speaker 7:  You walk through the fancy studio, right? Where all the people are working.

44
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:41,965
Speaker 7:  'cause the anchors like, you know, their shows look over the fancy studio,

45
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:45,165
Speaker 7:  all the people working and you're like, oh my God, I'm, I'm, I did, I may,

46
00:03:45,185 --> 00:03:48,885
Speaker 7:  I'm gonna be on cable news. Which over time fades in terms of

47
00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:52,525
Speaker 7:  excitement. And then you are led into this like hot windowless room where

48
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:55,885
Speaker 7:  no one else is there and you can't see them. And that was the thing that

49
00:03:55,885 --> 00:03:56,365
Speaker 7:  blew my mind.

50
00:03:58,635 --> 00:04:02,595
Speaker 7:  Jake is sitting in some sort of, you know, wireless network

51
00:04:02,705 --> 00:04:04,515
Speaker 7:  command center. That's what that looks like to me.

52
00:04:04,575 --> 00:04:08,115
Speaker 9:  And, and Neli by the way, recorded all of this dialogue hours ago. I'm just

53
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:08,715
Speaker 9:  responding to it.

54
00:04:10,055 --> 00:04:13,835
Speaker 7:  The first time I went and visited at and t's network operation center,

55
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:17,395
Speaker 7:  the Knock, which is here in New York. They have one in New York. I will never

56
00:04:17,395 --> 00:04:20,715
Speaker 7:  forget this. It's just a room of charts and graphs. I don't know why they

57
00:04:20,715 --> 00:04:24,635
Speaker 7:  need a command center. Like I, it, it was never actually made clear to

58
00:04:24,635 --> 00:04:28,475
Speaker 7:  me why they needed to build like NASA mission control

59
00:04:29,295 --> 00:04:33,035
Speaker 7:  for the wireless network. But they, they have it. It's cool. I think it's

60
00:04:33,035 --> 00:04:36,835
Speaker 7:  there for like partners to like look at stuff like they need a place that's

61
00:04:36,835 --> 00:04:40,475
Speaker 7:  like not a server rack, you know? But I will never forget

62
00:04:41,645 --> 00:04:45,385
Speaker 7:  one of the engineers just pointed to this huge trunk of traffic on the graph

63
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:46,585
Speaker 7:  and was like, that's porn.

64
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:52,465
Speaker 7:  Anyway. Just like, oh yeah, that's, you're probably,

65
00:04:55,405 --> 00:04:58,385
Speaker 7:  that's awesome. So Jake, If you could just wheel around and show us where

66
00:04:58,385 --> 00:04:58,865
Speaker 7:  the porn is,

67
00:04:59,085 --> 00:05:02,665
Speaker 9:  As you can see behind you there somewhere right here I think.

68
00:05:03,065 --> 00:05:06,625
Speaker 7:  Alright. We got a lot of talk about today. Not just Jake's wall of porn.

69
00:05:08,135 --> 00:05:12,105
Speaker 7:  There's new Apple products, there's a new iPad Air, there's a new MacBook

70
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:15,665
Speaker 7:  Air, there's a new Mac studio, which very

71
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:18,825
Speaker 7:  compelling. I I gotta say I have a lot to say about the New Mac studio.

72
00:05:19,505 --> 00:05:22,545
Speaker 7:  Then we got like two lightning rounds. Dig is back. David

73
00:05:23,505 --> 00:05:26,665
Speaker 7:  reported on the 15th return of dig. And then of course we're gonna end

74
00:05:27,325 --> 00:05:30,225
Speaker 7:  by just talking shit about Brendan Carr. That's what we do here on the B

75
00:05:30,225 --> 00:05:31,905
Speaker 7:  chest. I think it's gonna be a good one. I

76
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:35,425
Speaker 8:  Will say it is, it's a real bummer how popular that segment has become. And

77
00:05:35,425 --> 00:05:39,105
Speaker 8:  I've gotten a bunch of people who are like, please never kill Brendan

78
00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:42,105
Speaker 8:  Carr as a dummy because it's great. And I keep being like, look, I would

79
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:45,825
Speaker 8:  love to stop doing Brendan Carr as a dummy, but it requires a certain thing

80
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:49,505
Speaker 8:  that is not going to happen, which is pregnant easing to be a dummy.

81
00:05:49,605 --> 00:05:53,305
Speaker 8:  So this, this segment will be alive and well for a very long time. I suspect

82
00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:56,705
Speaker 7:  We we're at the point where we're getting fine grain criticism of the name

83
00:05:56,705 --> 00:05:59,965
Speaker 7:  of the segment. We'll, we'll come to it. I'll explain. Can I start with the

84
00:05:59,965 --> 00:06:02,805
Speaker 7:  gadget reveal though? One of the silliest gadgets I've ever purchased in

85
00:06:02,805 --> 00:06:06,605
Speaker 7:  my entire life. So we were on vacation, which many people conspiratorially

86
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:09,165
Speaker 7:  believed meant that I was either cloning my body or dead

87
00:06:10,845 --> 00:06:14,685
Speaker 7:  t knows. So we were on vacation, we go to the beach. I have a crap underwater

88
00:06:14,685 --> 00:06:18,565
Speaker 7:  camera that I bought a million years ago that is now quite fun to take 'cause

89
00:06:18,565 --> 00:06:21,045
Speaker 7:  I can just like give it to the 6-year-old and she can like have it at the

90
00:06:21,045 --> 00:06:24,105
Speaker 7:  beach and don't worry about it breaking, it takes horrible photos. It's just

91
00:06:24,105 --> 00:06:26,745
Speaker 7:  a real thing. And then you see all the people have like the iPhone cases,

92
00:06:27,585 --> 00:06:30,205
Speaker 7:  you know, and like that's not great either 'cause they get foggy and cloudy

93
00:06:30,205 --> 00:06:32,965
Speaker 7:  and whatever. So I was like, I'm gonna buy a new underwater camera. And I

94
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:36,725
Speaker 7:  went and I looked and the one that everybody buys is the Olympus TG six

95
00:06:36,785 --> 00:06:39,365
Speaker 7:  or the TG seven now. Which is basically the same thing with the US PC port.

96
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:43,135
Speaker 7:  It doesn't matter, it's like orange. It looks cool.

97
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:45,295
Speaker 7:  And then you look at the photos, you're like, this is not actually better

98
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:47,815
Speaker 7:  than my iPhone. I've now come all the way back around to I'm gonna buy this

99
00:06:47,935 --> 00:06:51,695
Speaker 7:  horrible case for an iPhone. And then I thought to myself, what if I order

100
00:06:51,695 --> 00:06:55,615
Speaker 7:  from Japan, Sony's underwater case from an

101
00:06:55,675 --> 00:06:56,295
Speaker 7:  RX 100

102
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:57,735
Speaker 9:  Oh oh wow.

103
00:06:58,305 --> 00:07:02,175
Speaker 7:  Which is just one of the silliest goddamn things in the entire world.

104
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:06,135
Speaker 7:  If you buy it in the States, it's like $350. If you buy it on eBay from Japan,

105
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:09,815
Speaker 7:  it's like 200. I don't understand how that works at all. Wait, you're,

106
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:11,575
Speaker 8:  You're saying this is your RX 100?

107
00:07:12,045 --> 00:07:13,455
Speaker 7:  Yeah, well it's the RX one. I don't have

108
00:07:13,455 --> 00:07:14,775
Speaker 9:  Isn't it a tiny Pointin shoot?

109
00:07:14,845 --> 00:07:17,535
Speaker 7:  Yeah, the RX 100 is a tiny pointin shoot. I'm sorry. Sorry. If you're listening

110
00:07:17,535 --> 00:07:18,535
Speaker 7:  to this triple, basically

111
00:07:18,535 --> 00:07:19,095
Speaker 8:  This is the size of your

112
00:07:19,095 --> 00:07:23,015
Speaker 7:  Camera giant plastic bubble that goes, I can't even figure

113
00:07:23,015 --> 00:07:26,095
Speaker 7:  out how to open it right now. It's basically a, you can hear all the slots.

114
00:07:26,115 --> 00:07:29,295
Speaker 7:  It, the camera fits into this giant plastic bubble. Whoa. Here's the best

115
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:30,415
Speaker 7:  part about it. This

116
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:34,375
Speaker 9:  Looks legit. This looks like it would survive like, you

117
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:34,455
Speaker 9:  know,

118
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:35,495
Speaker 8:  Depths.

119
00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:38,935
Speaker 7:  Yeah, it's for scuba divers. Yeah. So the RX 100 to control it,

120
00:07:39,395 --> 00:07:42,535
Speaker 7:  you turn the ring around the lens. If you're familiar with your RX 100, like

121
00:07:42,535 --> 00:07:45,735
Speaker 7:  that's how you change the aperture. So you gotta do that. So it came with

122
00:07:45,735 --> 00:07:49,575
Speaker 7:  a gear, like a rubber gear that you slip around the front

123
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:50,615
Speaker 7:  of the RX 100

124
00:07:52,275 --> 00:07:55,175
Speaker 7:  and then that rubber gear is geared to a big knob on the side.

125
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,815
Speaker 9:  Oh wow. Incredible.

126
00:07:56,955 --> 00:08:00,375
Speaker 7:  Easily the best gadget I've bought in a hundred years, I've been taking pictures

127
00:08:00,595 --> 00:08:03,695
Speaker 7:  in the house, which is not underwater.

128
00:08:04,515 --> 00:08:07,615
Speaker 7:  And then this big silly white thing on the front is the flash diffuser. So

129
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:11,575
Speaker 7:  you can pop up the flash and RX 100 and make flash photos underwater. So

130
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:12,895
Speaker 7:  I've been taking flash photos.

131
00:08:13,315 --> 00:08:15,775
Speaker 9:  Is flash useful underwater? Do you get the same like party

132
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:18,975
Speaker 7:  Effect once you like fall down the, the rabbit hole of like, I'm gonna take

133
00:08:18,975 --> 00:08:22,815
Speaker 7:  photos underwater. You get into like, it, it is as gadgety and nerdy

134
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:26,735
Speaker 7:  and like supportive space as any hobby. You know,

135
00:08:27,615 --> 00:08:31,455
Speaker 7:  I just wanted to have a camera that can get wet at the pool. So like, I

136
00:08:31,455 --> 00:08:34,895
Speaker 7:  don't think, I don't think I'll need the flash, you know, but it is easily

137
00:08:34,995 --> 00:08:37,855
Speaker 7:  one of the funniest gadgets I've ever purchased.

138
00:08:38,055 --> 00:08:41,765
Speaker 8:  I feel like the thing that that reminds me of is like, like really,

139
00:08:42,465 --> 00:08:46,445
Speaker 8:  really knock off James Bond gadgets. Yeah. Like if James Bond

140
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:50,805
Speaker 8:  had no budget because of tariffs, like all of a sudden

141
00:08:51,195 --> 00:08:54,285
Speaker 8:  he's getting these like large plastic cameras. But that thing is secretly

142
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:58,165
Speaker 8:  like a gun and A, and a voice recorder in addition to being a way to

143
00:08:58,165 --> 00:09:00,285
Speaker 8:  take underwater photos. I'm very into this thing.

144
00:09:00,585 --> 00:09:04,045
Speaker 7:  The, I mean it just, the fact that it was, first of all, it, it showed up.

145
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:06,605
Speaker 7:  It's from Japan, so all the instructions are in Japanese.

146
00:09:07,205 --> 00:09:07,645
Speaker 8:  Perfect.

147
00:09:07,865 --> 00:09:11,045
Speaker 7:  And like it's, it's basically just like a series of rubber gaskets and then

148
00:09:11,795 --> 00:09:15,085
Speaker 7:  affordances to turn the knobs and buttons on the RX 100.

149
00:09:16,025 --> 00:09:18,285
Speaker 7:  So there's, there's a wheel on the back and then there's like a mode dial

150
00:09:18,285 --> 00:09:22,245
Speaker 7:  on top. And so you have to like line everything up so

151
00:09:22,245 --> 00:09:26,085
Speaker 7:  that this knob right here can gear itself to turn

152
00:09:26,105 --> 00:09:29,995
Speaker 7:  the mode wheel on top of the camera. And I'm just like looking at these

153
00:09:30,145 --> 00:09:33,635
Speaker 7:  like Ikea pictures and all of his Japanese text and I was like,

154
00:09:34,495 --> 00:09:38,435
Speaker 7:  I'm a pretty smart guy. Like I'm gonna horsepower my way through this.

155
00:09:38,535 --> 00:09:41,435
Speaker 7:  And eventually I gave up and I downloaded the manual in English from the

156
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:45,395
Speaker 7:  internet. So, but it's, I had a lot of fun with it and it was sitting

157
00:09:45,395 --> 00:09:47,275
Speaker 7:  on the CES when I started recording and I was like, you know what, you know

158
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:51,235
Speaker 7:  what the show needs before we do Brendan Carr, this needs an

159
00:09:51,235 --> 00:09:54,595
Speaker 7:  honest to goodness ridiculous gadget. And there's nothing I love more than

160
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:57,515
Speaker 7:  a ridiculous semi gadget. True. By the way, there are many third party cases

161
00:09:57,515 --> 00:10:00,915
Speaker 7:  that are vastly cheaper. There are many third party cases vastly more expensive.

162
00:10:02,175 --> 00:10:06,065
Speaker 7:  This one was just, I Googled it on eBay and I was like, I I kind of

163
00:10:06,065 --> 00:10:08,705
Speaker 7:  wanna buy a, a silly gadget from Japan today. So I did

164
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:12,825
Speaker 8:  Anything that attaches to a button to move that button

165
00:10:12,825 --> 00:10:16,705
Speaker 8:  somewhere else. Yes. And turn it into a wheel that presses the button like

166
00:10:17,045 --> 00:10:18,985
Speaker 8:  you are The Verge now. Welcome. You've done it.

167
00:10:19,455 --> 00:10:20,385
Speaker 7:  It's so good. This

168
00:10:20,385 --> 00:10:20,985
Speaker 8:  Is what we do here.

169
00:10:21,265 --> 00:10:24,705
Speaker 7:  It's funny because we don't have another beach vacation plan. It's like,

170
00:10:24,705 --> 00:10:26,425
Speaker 7:  I don't even know what I'm gonna use. You need to find

171
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:30,265
Speaker 8:  Reasons to get underwater. It's just gonna be in the bathtub on like

172
00:10:30,305 --> 00:10:31,065
Speaker 8:  a Wednesday thing.

173
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,745
Speaker 7:  It's like cold in New York. Like I'm, I'm not getting in the pool anytime

174
00:10:35,855 --> 00:10:36,145
Speaker 7:  soon.

175
00:10:38,175 --> 00:10:41,915
Speaker 7:  Anyhow, I encourage you to send in your silly gadget

176
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,875
Speaker 7:  purchases. 'cause I think we all need that to keep us grounded as a community

177
00:10:45,135 --> 00:10:48,315
Speaker 7:  during these times. So speaking of silly gadgets, let's talk about all the

178
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:52,275
Speaker 7:  new Apple stuff. Tim Cook teased, you know, it was gonna be an air and

179
00:10:52,275 --> 00:10:56,155
Speaker 7:  then they started with the iPad Air, which I both understand and

180
00:10:56,695 --> 00:11:00,675
Speaker 7:  be, I think deflated everything that came after it. David, you you

181
00:11:00,675 --> 00:11:02,555
Speaker 7:  wrote this story. Try.

182
00:11:03,015 --> 00:11:06,515
Speaker 8:  So we kind of knew there were gonna be

183
00:11:06,725 --> 00:11:10,675
Speaker 8:  iPads. I think my operating assumption was that we were gonna

184
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:14,275
Speaker 8:  get a base iPad refreshed because that thing

185
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:18,275
Speaker 8:  hasn't been updated since I think the fall of 2022. We did, we did. And

186
00:11:18,275 --> 00:11:21,675
Speaker 8:  we'll get to that. But my, what my point is, my assumption was, okay, the,

187
00:11:21,675 --> 00:11:25,275
Speaker 8:  there's like, there, there was a lot of smoke around there being an Apple

188
00:11:25,515 --> 00:11:28,635
Speaker 8:  announcement this week. And I was like, I said to Jake, I was like, my, my

189
00:11:28,635 --> 00:11:32,195
Speaker 8:  betting thesis is it's gonna be the base iPad feels like it's time

190
00:11:32,495 --> 00:11:35,275
Speaker 8:  and then Tim Cook does this thing. And we're like, okay, maybe it's, maybe

191
00:11:35,275 --> 00:11:39,195
Speaker 8:  it's the MacBook Air because again, the iPad Air got revved less than 12

192
00:11:39,195 --> 00:11:43,075
Speaker 8:  months ago. Like the, the, this iPad Air that I have

193
00:11:43,075 --> 00:11:46,835
Speaker 8:  right here on my desk is less than a year old. And so I was like, well why

194
00:11:46,835 --> 00:11:50,235
Speaker 8:  on earth would there be a new iPad Air? And yet lo and behold there was a

195
00:11:50,235 --> 00:11:53,805
Speaker 8:  new iPad Air. So Apple announced, I would say

196
00:11:54,075 --> 00:11:57,885
Speaker 8:  with with interest and excitement on iPad Air

197
00:11:57,905 --> 00:12:01,765
Speaker 8:  and then tried to absolutely bury out of existence that it was also updating

198
00:12:01,865 --> 00:12:04,845
Speaker 8:  the base iPad. And we should talk about that. 'cause I think it's really

199
00:12:05,085 --> 00:12:08,845
Speaker 8:  fascinating. But the, the, the story of this iPad

200
00:12:08,905 --> 00:12:12,805
Speaker 8:  Air is precisely one thing. It's that it now has an

201
00:12:13,005 --> 00:12:15,725
Speaker 8:  M three chip instead of an M two chip. That's it.

202
00:12:16,245 --> 00:12:19,565
Speaker 7:  Actually, I think the story is ever so slightly different. I mean I, the

203
00:12:19,565 --> 00:12:22,125
Speaker 7:  air this new era has Apple intelligence, right. They've added it to that.

204
00:12:22,445 --> 00:12:23,405
Speaker 7:  It's not in the base model.

205
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:23,925
Speaker 8:  Right.

206
00:12:24,015 --> 00:12:27,845
Speaker 9:  Which is funny 'cause before these were announced, David and I were messaging

207
00:12:27,845 --> 00:12:31,325
Speaker 9:  each other on Slack and we're like, they've gotta just put Apple Intelligence

208
00:12:31,325 --> 00:12:34,085
Speaker 9:  on this and call it today. It's the only thing, only thing to do here. And

209
00:12:34,085 --> 00:12:35,045
Speaker 9:  it's the only thing they didn't do.

210
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,965
Speaker 8:  That's also the only thing Apple has been doing with its gadgets for the

211
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:38,565
Speaker 8:  last 12 months.

212
00:12:38,585 --> 00:12:41,925
Speaker 7:  That's what I mean. And I think they know the, the base is like a huge volume

213
00:12:41,925 --> 00:12:44,565
Speaker 7:  seller. Yeah. Like they're just selling base model iPads as

214
00:12:44,745 --> 00:12:48,405
Speaker 8:  And so is the air. I think like, I think pretty clearly the air is a hit.

215
00:12:48,765 --> 00:12:52,285
Speaker 8:  I keep telling people not to buy it, but it seems to still be Yes. One a

216
00:12:52,285 --> 00:12:53,085
Speaker 8:  lot of people land on.

217
00:12:53,865 --> 00:12:56,885
Speaker 7:  And I just think it's, I I think we're at the point with Apple intelligence

218
00:12:57,145 --> 00:13:01,085
Speaker 7:  in particular where the, you know, the bloom is just

219
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:04,125
Speaker 7:  off that road. Like it just doesn't matter to people. And so like

220
00:13:05,575 --> 00:13:08,715
Speaker 7:  adding Apple intelligence to any Apple gadget right now is really just a

221
00:13:08,715 --> 00:13:12,295
Speaker 7:  conversation about how much RAM it has. And I think they just didn't wanna

222
00:13:12,295 --> 00:13:14,695
Speaker 7:  put enough RAM in the, in the base model iPad.

223
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,815
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I think that's basically right. And there's, there's some weirdness

224
00:13:17,815 --> 00:13:21,735
Speaker 8:  happening where like there has been a pretty clean cutoff in terms of

225
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:24,655
Speaker 8:  chips that can get Apple intelligence. But now Apple is starting to roll

226
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:29,455
Speaker 8:  some of those features, but not all of them back to like the iPhone 15

227
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:33,455
Speaker 8:  line. And so it's like this line is just getting blurry in a way that I find

228
00:13:33,455 --> 00:13:37,215
Speaker 8:  very confusing. But also I, I think you're right that the

229
00:13:37,215 --> 00:13:41,055
Speaker 8:  overwhelming fact is no one cares. Apple, apple cares a

230
00:13:41,055 --> 00:13:44,535
Speaker 8:  great deal about you caring about Apple intelligence

231
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:45,975
Speaker 8:  and it just isn't working.

232
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:50,095
Speaker 9:  The top comment on our news story, which was, you know, apple and us

233
00:13:50,115 --> 00:13:53,895
Speaker 9:  new iPad but doesn't have Apple intelligence. Top comment was no Apple Intelligence

234
00:13:53,895 --> 00:13:57,855
Speaker 9:  sounds like an upgrade or something to that effect. It's like, yeah, like,

235
00:13:57,885 --> 00:14:00,975
Speaker 9:  like this is not, it's a, it's an annoying little button that gets in the

236
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:03,335
Speaker 9:  way right now. The extra RAM seems great. Yeah.

237
00:14:03,675 --> 00:14:06,295
Speaker 7:  So you know, we, we talked about Alexa for ages last week.

238
00:14:07,595 --> 00:14:11,335
Speaker 7:  My feeling is that Apple intelligence will not be a thing that anyone understands

239
00:14:11,505 --> 00:14:15,415
Speaker 7:  until the new Siri comes out. Yeah. Expressed is a bunch of

240
00:14:15,415 --> 00:14:19,325
Speaker 7:  weird text tools and Gen Moji who

241
00:14:19,495 --> 00:14:22,805
Speaker 7:  cares, right? I can talk to Siri like it's actually intelligent.

242
00:14:23,835 --> 00:14:26,335
Speaker 7:  That's the thing. And I think that's why they added the color and the animation

243
00:14:26,335 --> 00:14:29,735
Speaker 7:  to the existing Siri. But it, it doesn't do it. I think they should have

244
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:30,655
Speaker 7:  held off on that actually.

245
00:14:31,055 --> 00:14:34,815
Speaker 8:  I agree. I mean, and I think the, the response to the Alexa stuff

246
00:14:34,815 --> 00:14:37,775
Speaker 8:  from last week has been really interesting because on the one hand

247
00:14:38,825 --> 00:14:42,815
Speaker 8:  again, whether Amazon will actually deliver any of the

248
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:46,775
Speaker 8:  product it claims to have made TBD, all the signs are bad

249
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:51,015
Speaker 8:  for how that is going for Amazon. But they're saying

250
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,165
Speaker 8:  the right things about what they're trying to do. Right. And they've like

251
00:14:53,165 --> 00:14:56,965
Speaker 8:  announced the thing and all, like all of the people in the Apple universe

252
00:14:56,995 --> 00:15:00,925
Speaker 8:  that I know have spent this week being like, holy God is Siri far behind,

253
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:04,925
Speaker 8:  like further behind than anybody was. At least it was like, okay, this is

254
00:15:05,045 --> 00:15:08,885
Speaker 8:  actually really hard and If you have like a mainstream product and use case,

255
00:15:09,555 --> 00:15:13,525
Speaker 8:  just flipping that to LLM is tricky. And then Google

256
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:17,485
Speaker 8:  has done it. Amazon has done it. Siri sucks. And

257
00:15:17,495 --> 00:15:21,485
Speaker 8:  there was some reporting this week from Mark Kerman at Bloomberg saying that

258
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:25,325
Speaker 8:  it's possible that the better Siri is actually like two years away.

259
00:15:26,515 --> 00:15:30,445
Speaker 8:  Like we're, it's not close. And I think it this this thing Apple is

260
00:15:30,445 --> 00:15:34,365
Speaker 8:  trying to do just gets uglier because of your exact point. Apple is like

261
00:15:34,365 --> 00:15:37,445
Speaker 8:  hanging up billboards being like Apple intelligence and people are like,

262
00:15:37,445 --> 00:15:40,965
Speaker 8:  what? That just means bad summaries of my text messages right now. Yeah.

263
00:15:40,965 --> 00:15:44,125
Speaker 8:  That everyone should turn off. Like it's, it's actually a problem

264
00:15:44,455 --> 00:15:47,685
Speaker 9:  Every single one of their commercials there like aggressively saying like

265
00:15:47,785 --> 00:15:50,925
Speaker 9:  it comes with Apple intelligence and it's a as though this is the thing that

266
00:15:50,925 --> 00:15:54,205
Speaker 9:  people are excited about and it's funny that they're getting

267
00:15:54,635 --> 00:15:58,005
Speaker 9:  excited about buzzwords, which is like not a very Apple-like thing to do

268
00:15:58,005 --> 00:16:01,885
Speaker 9:  traditionally. Particularly when they haven't delivered. Yeah.

269
00:16:02,105 --> 00:16:06,085
Speaker 7:  And it's also when Chachi petit horrible name that no one can

270
00:16:06,085 --> 00:16:06,965
Speaker 7:  pronounce if

271
00:16:07,195 --> 00:16:11,165
Speaker 9:  Yeah, if they had just said like iPhone now with chat GBT, which it

272
00:16:11,165 --> 00:16:12,685
Speaker 9:  is. I I think people've been like, Hmm,

273
00:16:12,715 --> 00:16:16,045
Speaker 8:  That would've been way more compelling. Yeah. Yeah. We nuked Siri and now

274
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:18,205
Speaker 8:  it just goes straight to chat. GBT would've worked for people.

275
00:16:18,415 --> 00:16:22,405
Speaker 7:  Apple one now includes, you know, two hours of advanced voice mode

276
00:16:22,405 --> 00:16:26,365
Speaker 7:  and chat. GBT would've been fine. I, I like sure. But it's, it's a bad brand.

277
00:16:26,395 --> 00:16:28,845
Speaker 7:  Like I, I know so many people who

278
00:16:30,675 --> 00:16:34,485
Speaker 7:  call it chat GBT and it's like we're just like past the point of correcting

279
00:16:34,485 --> 00:16:37,005
Speaker 7:  your friends, you know, like whatever. It's fine. You just kind of say it.

280
00:16:37,005 --> 00:16:39,485
Speaker 7:  We all know what we're talking about here, right? Like yeah, you didn't buy

281
00:16:39,485 --> 00:16:42,045
Speaker 7:  it on Canal Street. Like it's fine. It's like,

282
00:16:42,325 --> 00:16:45,565
Speaker 8:  It's like singing a Michael Jackson song. You just like try to say the syllables

283
00:16:45,565 --> 00:16:47,845
Speaker 8:  kind of right. Yeah. And really fast and you just get through it and it's

284
00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:49,485
Speaker 7:  Fine. And then Rihanna samples it years later.

285
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:54,725
Speaker 7:  That's the real ones know exactly what I'm talking about. But the Apple intelligence

286
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:57,285
Speaker 7:  you have now, like you, you light up an iPhone and it's like, it's not in

287
00:16:57,285 --> 00:17:00,925
Speaker 7:  your face. No. But ch Chibi is a bad brand that people are using 'cause it's

288
00:17:00,925 --> 00:17:04,485
Speaker 7:  useful and like advanced voice mode is very

289
00:17:04,485 --> 00:17:08,325
Speaker 7:  compelling no matter what. Like, you don't need to think about what's happening.

290
00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:10,845
Speaker 7:  You're like, oh, I can just talk to this thing. And if they just given that

291
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:14,085
Speaker 7:  to Siri, I think it would've been fine. I think you would've ended up in

292
00:17:14,085 --> 00:17:17,125
Speaker 7:  weird spots where people tried to jailbreak it or you had privacy issues

293
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,565
Speaker 7:  or Kevin Ru fell in love with it.

294
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,345
Speaker 7:  Siri tried to bang me again. Kevin, I I don't want to give the New York Times

295
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,985
Speaker 7:  headlines. It's right there for you. That should be a front page story. It's

296
00:17:27,985 --> 00:17:31,185
Speaker 7:  true. But they haven't done any of that stuff anyway. I just think it's really

297
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:35,185
Speaker 7:  fascinating that the base model iPad, which is just the thing that sells

298
00:17:35,185 --> 00:17:38,905
Speaker 7:  like forever and ever Sells, doesn't have this feature

299
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:42,145
Speaker 7:  'cause they don't need it. 'cause the thing is it like a Disney plus machine,

300
00:17:42,485 --> 00:17:45,585
Speaker 7:  you know, like for so many people or it's deployed in enterprise and the

301
00:17:45,585 --> 00:17:48,185
Speaker 7:  enterprises don't want Apple intelligence or it's in schools and they don't

302
00:17:48,185 --> 00:17:51,485
Speaker 7:  want, like whatever that base model iPad represents

303
00:17:51,985 --> 00:17:55,965
Speaker 7:  is not improved by Apple intelligence. And I think that says something very

304
00:17:55,965 --> 00:17:56,285
Speaker 7:  important.

305
00:17:56,515 --> 00:18:00,365
Speaker 8:  Well, and and what it super clearly communicates is

306
00:18:00,365 --> 00:18:04,285
Speaker 8:  that however Apple wants to feel about Apple intelligence, it knows

307
00:18:04,305 --> 00:18:07,885
Speaker 8:  for absolute certain that it is not a thing it can raise the price for

308
00:18:08,135 --> 00:18:12,045
Speaker 8:  Right. Because if you're, if you're Apple, you, you, it's the, the base

309
00:18:12,195 --> 00:18:16,165
Speaker 8:  iPad now has the A 16 chip, which is a two

310
00:18:16,275 --> 00:18:19,845
Speaker 8:  chip bump from before, which is great, but is still

311
00:18:20,455 --> 00:18:23,485
Speaker 8:  below the technical requirements to do

312
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:28,685
Speaker 8:  what you need with Apple intelligence. And they could have added

313
00:18:28,685 --> 00:18:31,885
Speaker 8:  that chip, but then it would've made the thing more expensive. And

314
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:36,405
Speaker 8:  for a, for Apple, I think having a $349 iPad is actually really

315
00:18:36,405 --> 00:18:39,765
Speaker 8:  important for a bunch of reasons. But also I think

316
00:18:40,755 --> 00:18:44,325
Speaker 8:  this iPad now has Apple intelligence and is $50 more expensive is

317
00:18:44,685 --> 00:18:47,805
Speaker 8:  not a winning sentence. And I think Apple knows that very, very clearly.

318
00:18:48,115 --> 00:18:51,925
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I threatened you with 90 minutes on inconsequential iPad bumps.

319
00:18:52,885 --> 00:18:54,665
Speaker 7:  Do you feel it? Do you feel it? Is it coming?

320
00:18:55,005 --> 00:18:58,825
Speaker 9:  Can I speak to some slightly also

321
00:18:58,825 --> 00:19:01,865
Speaker 9:  inconsequential iPad Air things? Yeah. That, that, that went a little under

322
00:19:01,865 --> 00:19:05,845
Speaker 9:  the radar. So they added the

323
00:19:06,205 --> 00:19:09,245
Speaker 9:  function row keys that rules to the magic keyboard for the iPad

324
00:19:09,245 --> 00:19:12,725
Speaker 8:  Air. Not inconsequential. That's the biggest upgrade here by a mile.

325
00:19:12,905 --> 00:19:16,805
Speaker 9:  And they dropped the price on those by 30 bucks each. They're still crazy

326
00:19:16,805 --> 00:19:20,605
Speaker 9:  expensive. It's still like 250 or 300 bucks or something insane. Yeah.

327
00:19:20,605 --> 00:19:23,645
Speaker 8:  They went from most expensive keyboard ever. Two most expensive keyboard

328
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:24,765
Speaker 8:  ever. Minus $30.

329
00:19:25,065 --> 00:19:28,805
Speaker 9:  You can still like buy another iPad for the price of a magic

330
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:32,965
Speaker 9:  keyboard, which actually would kind of rule. But

331
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:36,045
Speaker 9:  that's, I the function keys are, are great. Yes.

332
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:36,445
Speaker 8:  Yes.

333
00:19:36,445 --> 00:19:39,605
Speaker 9:  That's an important improvement. The iPad Air feels like it's getting ever

334
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:43,285
Speaker 9:  so slightly closer to being the tablet version of the MacBook Air.

335
00:19:43,555 --> 00:19:47,205
Speaker 9:  Like you're supposed to spend roughly a thousand dollars on it. You buy the

336
00:19:47,365 --> 00:19:51,245
Speaker 9:  13 inch version, you spend 300 bucks or whatever on the magic

337
00:19:51,605 --> 00:19:55,405
Speaker 9:  keyboard and the stylus and you know, you don't get the fanciest stuff,

338
00:19:55,405 --> 00:19:57,885
Speaker 9:  you don't get the high refresh rate display,

339
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:04,365
Speaker 9:  but you haven't spent all of your money on this thing. It

340
00:20:04,365 --> 00:20:08,085
Speaker 9:  gets most of the stuff done that you needed to get done. It's,

341
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:11,765
Speaker 9:  it's, it's not exciting in that way. I think it's really interesting. I was

342
00:20:11,765 --> 00:20:15,685
Speaker 9:  just looking over David's like recent iPad reviews. There is the only

343
00:20:16,075 --> 00:20:18,085
Speaker 9:  iPad that David says not to get and

344
00:20:18,085 --> 00:20:19,005
Speaker 7:  It's the one everybody buys.

345
00:20:19,195 --> 00:20:21,245
Speaker 9:  It's right in the middle. It's, it's really tough.

346
00:20:21,825 --> 00:20:25,725
Speaker 8:  The air has at times gotten it right. And I think

347
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:29,885
Speaker 8:  there, like the, the thing it's trying to do is the right thing,

348
00:20:29,885 --> 00:20:33,725
Speaker 8:  right? Because like the iPad Pro is incredible and three times

349
00:20:33,835 --> 00:20:37,645
Speaker 8:  what anybody needs both in price and in performance, right? Like

350
00:20:37,645 --> 00:20:41,445
Speaker 8:  it's, it's massive, massive overkill. The thing the iPad

351
00:20:41,445 --> 00:20:45,285
Speaker 8:  Air has to do is convince you that you need more than the base iPad. And

352
00:20:45,325 --> 00:20:49,205
Speaker 8:  I think that case from Apple more for software reasons than for anything

353
00:20:49,205 --> 00:20:52,685
Speaker 8:  else has gotten weaker over time. And I think what, what Apple will tell

354
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:56,565
Speaker 8:  you is that the thing that makes people step up is either the accessories,

355
00:20:56,815 --> 00:21:00,245
Speaker 8:  which it clearly gates to this device because oh, I want a keyboard so I

356
00:21:00,245 --> 00:21:03,325
Speaker 8:  can send an email. Now I have to get the air because that's how I get the

357
00:21:03,325 --> 00:21:07,045
Speaker 8:  good keyboard attachment. Or same with the pencil, right? Like those things

358
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:10,645
Speaker 8:  are, are gated not for technical reasons, but because Apple is trying to

359
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:14,565
Speaker 8:  get you to upgrade. Like that's, that's just real. Or because people

360
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:17,885
Speaker 8:  want the extra performance because they're doing the, the kinds of creative

361
00:21:17,885 --> 00:21:21,285
Speaker 8:  tasks that Apple always shows you on stage. Right? It's like if you're using

362
00:21:22,055 --> 00:21:26,005
Speaker 8:  Final Cut Pro and Logic on your iPad, yes you should get

363
00:21:26,005 --> 00:21:29,685
Speaker 8:  an error and not a base iPad. I cannot prove this,

364
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:33,925
Speaker 8:  but I'm willing to bet that that is a teeny

365
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:37,885
Speaker 8:  tiny sliver of iPad people. And, and to me, the, the

366
00:21:37,885 --> 00:21:40,645
Speaker 8:  thing that I find myself saying a lot, and I, I wrote this, I recently updated

367
00:21:40,665 --> 00:21:44,365
Speaker 8:  our iPad buying guide and was basically like, there are

368
00:21:44,465 --> 00:21:48,285
Speaker 8:  two types of iPad users. There are people who want to just like send emails

369
00:21:48,665 --> 00:21:52,565
Speaker 8:  and browse the web and do the crossword puzzle and

370
00:21:52,715 --> 00:21:55,445
Speaker 8:  like look at photos, right? That is like, they're sort of the basic iPad

371
00:21:55,445 --> 00:21:56,445
Speaker 8:  grandparents tasks you,

372
00:21:56,445 --> 00:21:57,965
Speaker 7:  You've described grandparents. Sure.

373
00:21:57,995 --> 00:22:01,485
Speaker 8:  Yeah. There are a lot of those out there. And a lot of them have iPads, I

374
00:22:01,485 --> 00:22:05,085
Speaker 8:  can tell you constantly. And then there are the people who are like, I want

375
00:22:05,605 --> 00:22:08,165
Speaker 8:  a creative machine, right? And that's where like the pencil is really useful,

376
00:22:08,165 --> 00:22:11,085
Speaker 8:  whether you're drawing or you're editing videos or whatever. But it is like

377
00:22:11,085 --> 00:22:14,925
Speaker 8:  you are doing hardcore creative tasks and that's when you show

378
00:22:14,925 --> 00:22:18,645
Speaker 8:  up. And I think many, many, many people have convinced

379
00:22:18,645 --> 00:22:22,165
Speaker 8:  themselves that they are the second kind of iPad user when in reality they

380
00:22:22,165 --> 00:22:23,605
Speaker 8:  are actually the first kind of iPad user.

381
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:27,125
Speaker 7:  You're, you're just describing Apple as a community.

382
00:22:27,585 --> 00:22:31,205
Speaker 7:  People who are like, what I do is 3D graphics and you're like, what you do

383
00:22:31,205 --> 00:22:33,365
Speaker 7:  is CD emails, right? What

384
00:22:33,365 --> 00:22:36,845
Speaker 8:  You do is watch Netflix and like that's fine. And the

385
00:22:36,845 --> 00:22:40,805
Speaker 8:  $349 iPad is a kick ass Netflix machine and

386
00:22:40,805 --> 00:22:41,965
Speaker 8:  it's gonna be an even better one.

387
00:22:41,965 --> 00:22:44,445
Speaker 7:  Now, I don't mean to say that pejoratively 'cause we're gonna talk about

388
00:22:44,445 --> 00:22:47,485
Speaker 7:  the Mac Studio in a minute and I'm basically convincing myself to buy a Mac

389
00:22:47,485 --> 00:22:50,285
Speaker 7:  studio and my job is 1000% emails.

390
00:22:52,045 --> 00:22:55,765
Speaker 7:  I don't Yeah. I'm just describing myself. Oh, same. We can all be that person

391
00:22:56,005 --> 00:22:59,565
Speaker 7:  together. I'm just Yeah. Yeah. Every now and again, I look at the Photoshop

392
00:22:59,635 --> 00:23:03,205
Speaker 7:  icon on my computer, right? Huh? Does that count? Think about it. Right.

393
00:23:03,205 --> 00:23:03,885
Speaker 8:  And, and Apple,

394
00:23:04,205 --> 00:23:05,605
Speaker 7:  I need, I need 30 GPUs.

395
00:23:07,985 --> 00:23:10,645
Speaker 8:  And Jake, I think to your point about the MacBook Air, I think one of the

396
00:23:10,645 --> 00:23:14,565
Speaker 8:  things that has worked really well for Apple is upselling on that with

397
00:23:14,565 --> 00:23:18,165
Speaker 8:  your laptop or your desktop or whatever. Because that like by

398
00:23:18,165 --> 00:23:21,005
Speaker 8:  definition needs to be your most powerful machine. So if you're ever gonna

399
00:23:21,045 --> 00:23:24,965
Speaker 8:  overkill on something, it should be a Mac and on the iPad, I think

400
00:23:24,965 --> 00:23:27,765
Speaker 8:  the thing to do is actually just be honest with yourself about like, what

401
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:31,725
Speaker 8:  is this thing really for in my life? And to me it's been a while since the

402
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:35,685
Speaker 8:  air has made a case above and beyond what

403
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:38,525
Speaker 8:  most people are actually going to do on their iPads. If

404
00:23:38,525 --> 00:23:42,285
Speaker 9:  You could do high frame rate subway surfers, that would be a game

405
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:44,045
Speaker 9:  changer. But you gotta upgrade

406
00:23:44,045 --> 00:23:44,645
Speaker 8:  To the pro for this.

407
00:23:44,745 --> 00:23:47,125
Speaker 7:  All right? Right. I said we were gonna talk about the iPad Air for 90 minutes

408
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:51,165
Speaker 7:  as a joke. And it is just threatening to become real. We have to move on

409
00:23:51,345 --> 00:23:55,125
Speaker 7:  to actual products that are worth talking about. Sorry to the iPad team,

410
00:23:55,745 --> 00:23:59,735
Speaker 7:  you know, change the software maybe, you know, allow, allow real

411
00:23:59,735 --> 00:24:02,575
Speaker 7:  multitasking. I'll, I'll give you, I'll give you three episodes of the show

412
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:03,735
Speaker 7:  If you allow real, can

413
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:06,375
Speaker 8:  I just throw a trivia question at both of you before we move on?

414
00:24:06,515 --> 00:24:10,375
Speaker 7:  Let it run Maco West. The whole VERGE for a month will be about the new iPad.

415
00:24:10,475 --> 00:24:14,055
Speaker 8:  Yes, a hundred percent. How long would you guys think

416
00:24:14,435 --> 00:24:18,375
Speaker 8:  the, like average lifespan of an iPad is? Like if I, if I'm

417
00:24:18,495 --> 00:24:21,775
Speaker 8:  shopping for this one, how old is my current iPad? It

418
00:24:21,775 --> 00:24:24,695
Speaker 7:  It, it's gotta be over five. That's my, my heartfelt belief.

419
00:24:25,545 --> 00:24:29,315
Speaker 8:  Jake, what do you think? Yeah, it's like seven years. Okay. Almost every

420
00:24:29,315 --> 00:24:31,875
Speaker 8:  number I've seen it's, this is a hard thing to measure, but almost every

421
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:35,635
Speaker 8:  number I've seen says somewhere between five and seven years. Yeah. Which

422
00:24:35,635 --> 00:24:38,155
Speaker 8:  is interesting, right? Because then it's like, okay, If you bought, If you

423
00:24:38,155 --> 00:24:42,075
Speaker 8:  bought something in 2020, you bought the fourth

424
00:24:42,295 --> 00:24:46,035
Speaker 8:  gen iPad Air in like a Covid haze,

425
00:24:47,245 --> 00:24:51,115
Speaker 8:  which had an a 14 chip and it had touch id, that thing is still

426
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:54,355
Speaker 8:  getting software updates. I, I don't know that there's anything about these

427
00:24:54,355 --> 00:24:58,035
Speaker 8:  new devices that is like so vastly better that you need to go

428
00:24:58,215 --> 00:25:02,075
Speaker 8:  get it right now. Which is both the incredible success of the

429
00:25:02,105 --> 00:25:04,875
Speaker 8:  iPad. And also a very weird thing about these devices, like, but

430
00:25:05,415 --> 00:25:08,395
Speaker 7:  To Apple's credit, this has been their business for a long time, right? They

431
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:10,075
Speaker 7:  they are committed to their products.

432
00:25:10,145 --> 00:25:10,835
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Oh yeah.

433
00:25:11,055 --> 00:25:13,835
Speaker 7:  So they're just like, we're just gonna make another one on, on a cadence

434
00:25:14,255 --> 00:25:18,195
Speaker 7:  and they're gonna last a long time. And their money now is

435
00:25:18,195 --> 00:25:22,035
Speaker 7:  not in selling the hardware, it's in taking a cut of every

436
00:25:22,035 --> 00:25:25,555
Speaker 7:  button that you push in their operating systems. Right? It's in the app store

437
00:25:25,555 --> 00:25:29,435
Speaker 7:  fees, it's in Apple one service fees. It's sending you to chat

438
00:25:29,515 --> 00:25:32,195
Speaker 7:  GBT and Apple Intelligence and taking a cut of that subscription. If you

439
00:25:32,195 --> 00:25:36,135
Speaker 7:  buy it. Like all of that is their money. It's giving Apple

440
00:25:36,195 --> 00:25:39,855
Speaker 7:  TV plus away for free If you merely blink at a number of partners. Like

441
00:25:41,155 --> 00:25:44,735
Speaker 7:  that's all their money. And so I think the hardware lasting a long time is

442
00:25:44,895 --> 00:25:47,055
Speaker 7:  actually, you can complain a lot about that business model, the services

443
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:51,015
Speaker 7:  business model. 'cause it feels like using the devices is increasingly monetized.

444
00:25:51,715 --> 00:25:55,215
Speaker 7:  But on the other end of it is the devices last a long time and they give

445
00:25:55,335 --> 00:25:58,775
Speaker 7:  'em software updates for a long time. Yeah. Could they be, does that model

446
00:25:58,775 --> 00:26:02,475
Speaker 7:  suggest the devices could be cheaper? It sure does,

447
00:26:02,615 --> 00:26:04,755
Speaker 7:  but Apple's never gonna make the devices cheaper. No,

448
00:26:04,775 --> 00:26:07,835
Speaker 8:  But it, but I, I do think you're right. And I think the more I look at these

449
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:11,435
Speaker 8:  announcements, and I think there's some truth to this with the max too. Like

450
00:26:11,965 --> 00:26:15,635
Speaker 8:  Apple is a software company in a very real way. Like Apple is

451
00:26:15,905 --> 00:26:19,075
Speaker 8:  more interested in just putting a thing in your hands that you will use software

452
00:26:19,095 --> 00:26:22,955
Speaker 8:  on than it is on like reinventing

453
00:26:22,975 --> 00:26:24,875
Speaker 8:  its hardware all the time. And that's fine.

454
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:27,755
Speaker 7:  Well that's been true. We, we, we should talk about the air. 'cause they

455
00:26:27,835 --> 00:26:30,555
Speaker 7:  actually did lower presses in the air and that was intended once again to

456
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:34,475
Speaker 7:  be a segue away from these inconsequential. But Apple's a software

457
00:26:34,475 --> 00:26:38,235
Speaker 7:  company has been true since the days of Steve Jobs. He was very fond. I think

458
00:26:38,235 --> 00:26:42,155
Speaker 7:  it's Alan k. Famous computer scientist from back in the day. The,

459
00:26:42,295 --> 00:26:46,165
Speaker 7:  his quote was, if people who are really serious about software

460
00:26:46,165 --> 00:26:49,885
Speaker 7:  build their own hardware and that's like a motivating Steve Jobs quote. Totally.

461
00:26:49,885 --> 00:26:53,165
Speaker 7:  Like he talked about from the beginning. So I think that's still there in

462
00:26:53,165 --> 00:26:56,325
Speaker 7:  real for Apple. It's now expressed all the way into like they design their

463
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:59,325
Speaker 7:  own modems for the iPhone. Like they're very serious about building their

464
00:26:59,325 --> 00:27:03,045
Speaker 7:  own hardware and in very different kind of way. Yes. But it's the

465
00:27:03,245 --> 00:27:06,845
Speaker 7:  services component of that where they don't care If you have the device

466
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:11,005
Speaker 7:  for 10 years as long as you are paying that iCloud storage fee for

467
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:14,605
Speaker 7:  each and every one of those 10 years. And I, that has a lot of effects. Like

468
00:27:14,705 --> 00:27:18,165
Speaker 7:  it changes your relationship to the device. It changes what Apple tries to

469
00:27:18,165 --> 00:27:21,325
Speaker 7:  sell you. It changes what applications get built and deployed on those devices.

470
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:26,045
Speaker 7:  It changes, you know, like free to play games exist because of this model

471
00:27:26,225 --> 00:27:29,845
Speaker 7:  and Apple has to not, apple has to studiously avoid

472
00:27:29,845 --> 00:27:33,525
Speaker 7:  pointing out that a huge portion of its revenue comes from like five

473
00:27:33,525 --> 00:27:37,485
Speaker 7:  candy crush whales. Like yeah. That's just it all, there's all

474
00:27:37,485 --> 00:27:40,405
Speaker 7:  these weird outcomes there. But one of them that's very concrete is, oh,

475
00:27:40,455 --> 00:27:42,725
Speaker 7:  iPads last for a hundred years. Like that's fine. Right.

476
00:27:42,725 --> 00:27:44,205
Speaker 8:  Which in a vacuum is awesome. Yeah.

477
00:27:44,315 --> 00:27:48,205
Speaker 7:  Alright. MacBook Air, they did lower the price, which is shocking in

478
00:27:48,205 --> 00:27:51,445
Speaker 7:  the context of tariffs 'cause we just assume prices will go up. But Apple

479
00:27:51,685 --> 00:27:54,925
Speaker 7:  actually lowered price in the air. They added the sky blue color, which is

480
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:57,605
Speaker 7:  very pale. It's very beautiful, but it's very pale.

481
00:27:57,985 --> 00:28:01,925
Speaker 8:  I'm kind of into it. I didn't like it. I have a, I have a blue

482
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:04,605
Speaker 8:  iPad mini from last year that I didn't really like, but there's something

483
00:28:04,605 --> 00:28:08,525
Speaker 8:  about the like larger size of it and the sort of open screen on

484
00:28:08,525 --> 00:28:10,205
Speaker 8:  a table that I'm actually kind of into in the blue.

485
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,525
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It looks, it looks good. In the video we made and

486
00:28:12,815 --> 00:28:14,445
Speaker 9:  Space gray's dead now

487
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:18,085
Speaker 7:  Space gray, which was not a color space gray was always a concept. It was

488
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:21,405
Speaker 7:  15, it was 15 different colors over the years. Is

489
00:28:21,405 --> 00:28:22,205
Speaker 8:  That, I guess that is true.

490
00:28:22,205 --> 00:28:24,725
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It was never like a Pantone color. Like Apple would be like, I don't

491
00:28:24,725 --> 00:28:27,485
Speaker 7:  know, this is like the gray we can make the aluminum today space gray. It

492
00:28:27,485 --> 00:28:28,285
Speaker 7:  is, it's the

493
00:28:28,285 --> 00:28:28,445
Speaker 8:  Dark

494
00:28:28,465 --> 00:28:32,405
Speaker 7:  One. Yeah. Right. So it's gone. But hopefully we'll

495
00:28:32,405 --> 00:28:36,245
Speaker 7:  come back or a black will come back. That would be tight.

496
00:28:36,825 --> 00:28:40,805
Speaker 7:  The 13 inch to 9, 9 9, the 15 is 1199. So cheaper. And then

497
00:28:40,805 --> 00:28:44,245
Speaker 7:  they rev webcam. So this is very much just a spec bump, but I think it's

498
00:28:44,245 --> 00:28:46,885
Speaker 7:  a pretty good spec bump, especially at a lower price.

499
00:28:47,235 --> 00:28:51,125
Speaker 9:  Well, especially they, they bumped the base ram last

500
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:53,485
Speaker 9:  year mid cycle. And so now that's,

501
00:28:53,485 --> 00:28:54,645
Speaker 7:  That's your Apple intelligence.

502
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:58,845
Speaker 9:  Hey, you know what I, I've totally changed my tune. Apple Intelligence is

503
00:28:58,845 --> 00:29:02,645
Speaker 9:  the greatest thing that's happened to mankind. Right? But for for

504
00:29:02,725 --> 00:29:06,285
Speaker 9:  a grand, you now get a a, I think a very serviceable MacBook.

505
00:29:06,605 --> 00:29:10,445
Speaker 9:  That's great. That, that's like a, a huge upgrade actually, even

506
00:29:10,445 --> 00:29:11,805
Speaker 9:  though this is otherwise pretty quiet.

507
00:29:12,035 --> 00:29:15,245
Speaker 8:  What if the legacy of the whole AI craze

508
00:29:15,825 --> 00:29:18,805
Speaker 8:  is just that Chrome runs better on everybody's computers because we have,

509
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:24,005
Speaker 7:  I mean that has been the legacy of like virtually every major hardware revision

510
00:29:24,065 --> 00:29:27,645
Speaker 7:  is like, oh, Chrome will now eat these resources as well. But yeah, no, you,

511
00:29:27,715 --> 00:29:30,885
Speaker 7:  it's true. You buy a new MacBook, you turn off Apple Intelligence, you got

512
00:29:31,085 --> 00:29:34,365
Speaker 7:  yourself a 16 gig RAM upgrade for no money. It's like amazing.

513
00:29:35,445 --> 00:29:38,945
Speaker 7:  You turn it on and maybe that AI model starts to eat some of that ram, which

514
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:40,815
Speaker 7:  is, that's the trade off, right?

515
00:29:41,835 --> 00:29:42,125
Speaker 8:  Yeah.

516
00:29:42,425 --> 00:29:46,045
Speaker 9:  We think we, nobody's actually sure what Apple Intelligence can do.

517
00:29:47,065 --> 00:29:48,365
Speaker 9:  We, we, we have

518
00:29:48,365 --> 00:29:50,365
Speaker 7:  Figured out it weird gigabytes of ran hold

519
00:29:50,715 --> 00:29:54,645
Speaker 9:  That it is running on the computer, changing all of the things we write

520
00:29:54,645 --> 00:29:55,205
Speaker 9:  to be smarter.

521
00:29:56,475 --> 00:30:00,285
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It, they've, they've RevB the webcam to match the MacBook

522
00:30:00,355 --> 00:30:01,165
Speaker 7:  Pros webcam.

523
00:30:02,765 --> 00:30:06,745
Speaker 7:  I'm, I dunno, but I feel like Apple keeps promising us

524
00:30:06,745 --> 00:30:08,545
Speaker 7:  better webcams and they're all still kind of bad.

525
00:30:09,135 --> 00:30:13,035
Speaker 8:  Yeah. It's a webcam. Like it's fine. I I I actually think

526
00:30:14,105 --> 00:30:16,825
Speaker 8:  somewhat to Apple's credit, it has hit a point where it's webcams are fine.

527
00:30:17,135 --> 00:30:20,385
Speaker 8:  Yeah, they're fine. They were not fine for a very long time, but they're

528
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:20,745
Speaker 8:  fine now.

529
00:30:20,965 --> 00:30:24,145
Speaker 7:  So that's the rev of the air, which is interesting and I think a great computer.

530
00:30:24,145 --> 00:30:28,065
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I think for 9 99 it's very hard to compete with I MacBook

531
00:30:28,065 --> 00:30:31,985
Speaker 7:  Air as is currently configured and presented it. But it's

532
00:30:31,985 --> 00:30:35,105
Speaker 7:  also true that we were like at MWC this week and like

533
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:39,825
Speaker 7:  we saw giant like tri-fold laptops.

534
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:44,425
Speaker 7:  We, the framework laptops were out. Like there's all kinds of, there's all

535
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:47,945
Speaker 7:  kinds of action in the laptop space and it, it's all still

536
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:51,785
Speaker 7:  revolving around a thousand dollars MacBook Air that is deeply hard to compete

537
00:30:51,785 --> 00:30:55,665
Speaker 7:  with. Yeah. What do we think is going on there? Like, I see, what was

538
00:30:55,665 --> 00:30:59,145
Speaker 7:  that Lenovo one? Like they demoed a giant calculator, like a huge portrait

539
00:30:59,145 --> 00:30:59,905
Speaker 7:  screen. Oh, my screen

540
00:30:59,905 --> 00:31:00,025
Speaker 9:  With

541
00:31:00,265 --> 00:31:03,225
Speaker 7:  A calculator on it. I love this thing. Like I, I mean I'm, I'm here with

542
00:31:03,225 --> 00:31:06,145
Speaker 7:  a giant underwater camera bubble, like give me a gadget, right?

543
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:10,305
Speaker 9:  Lenovo now has two different versions of basically this exact same

544
00:31:10,325 --> 00:31:14,145
Speaker 9:  laptop where they're like, what if the screen was twice as much

545
00:31:14,145 --> 00:31:17,985
Speaker 9:  screen and one the screen just like

546
00:31:18,315 --> 00:31:22,265
Speaker 9:  rolls out from inside the laptop. Yeah. That was like a month ago.

547
00:31:23,005 --> 00:31:26,665
Speaker 9:  And now they're like, wait a second. The screen's always out. It just

548
00:31:26,835 --> 00:31:30,785
Speaker 9:  folds back. So one, it's always outside one, it's inside. Yeah. It

549
00:31:30,785 --> 00:31:34,265
Speaker 9:  doesn't matter either way. It's still just a giant, super tall screen

550
00:31:35,165 --> 00:31:38,945
Speaker 9:  and it looks just genuinely, utterly insane

551
00:31:39,845 --> 00:31:42,825
Speaker 9:  to, to like have this little thing in front of you that you type on with

552
00:31:42,865 --> 00:31:46,305
Speaker 9:  a enormous screen. But it also looks amazing and I want it more than anything.

553
00:31:46,485 --> 00:31:50,295
Speaker 7:  So Lenovo I believe has been

554
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:54,455
Speaker 7:  the like foremost proponent of tent mode

555
00:31:54,555 --> 00:31:57,975
Speaker 7:  for laptops Yes. For years now. Like a full decade. Yep.

556
00:31:58,015 --> 00:32:01,895
Speaker 7:  Lenovo's like, look, the way you want to use the computer is intent mode.

557
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:06,215
Speaker 7:  Remember the yogas, the, the foldable, the two in one tablets, they were

558
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:10,135
Speaker 7:  making like the service competitors, If you will recall, like the, the thing

559
00:32:10,645 --> 00:32:14,055
Speaker 7:  that they wanted you to do with a Lenovo yoga was tent mode. It

560
00:32:14,055 --> 00:32:15,655
Speaker 8:  Was so flippy. I loved it.

561
00:32:15,755 --> 00:32:19,735
Speaker 7:  It was so flippy. And so this new concept that Jake is talking about, you

562
00:32:19,735 --> 00:32:22,415
Speaker 7:  can fold it back and put it in tent mode. So you have a, what looks like

563
00:32:22,415 --> 00:32:26,135
Speaker 7:  a laptop, but then the screen is folded back over at an angle. So

564
00:32:26,135 --> 00:32:29,935
Speaker 7:  it's a tent and someone sitting across screen on a table can see what's on

565
00:32:29,935 --> 00:32:33,775
Speaker 7:  that screen. I love, I love the brain that

566
00:32:34,005 --> 00:32:37,375
Speaker 7:  Yeah, whoever you are, like show yourself. I wanna hug you that

567
00:32:37,565 --> 00:32:41,205
Speaker 7:  thought. Okay, here's how people should use laptops with other people.

568
00:32:42,765 --> 00:32:45,975
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Here's what I need you to do. I need you to sit across from me while

569
00:32:45,975 --> 00:32:48,975
Speaker 7:  I look at my laptop, but then I'm gonna fold the screen back over in intent

570
00:32:48,975 --> 00:32:52,775
Speaker 7:  mode. And then you'll look at this screen while I look at this screen and

571
00:32:52,775 --> 00:32:53,615
Speaker 7:  we're gonna make eye contact.

572
00:32:54,235 --> 00:32:57,895
Speaker 9:  The, I just tell you the, their product guy told Antonio

573
00:32:58,275 --> 00:33:02,055
Speaker 9:  on our team, he said that the thing they compromised on was that they

574
00:33:02,055 --> 00:33:06,015
Speaker 9:  wanted to put an entire smartphone screen to replace the

575
00:33:06,015 --> 00:33:08,215
Speaker 9:  track pad. But that was too far.

576
00:33:09,525 --> 00:33:11,975
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Oh, that was too, yeah. That's just outlandish.

577
00:33:11,975 --> 00:33:13,615
Speaker 9:  They, they couldn't make that happen a

578
00:33:13,615 --> 00:33:13,935
Speaker 8:  Screen.

579
00:33:14,475 --> 00:33:18,445
Speaker 7:  If you are out there regularly using tent mode, it it,

580
00:33:18,505 --> 00:33:21,085
Speaker 7:  you know, maybe you've got a 10-year-old Lenovo yoga, like, well whoever

581
00:33:21,085 --> 00:33:24,445
Speaker 7:  you are, If you are out there and you are either regularly using tent mode

582
00:33:24,985 --> 00:33:28,875
Speaker 7:  or you've heard me describe this and you are like

583
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:32,075
Speaker 7:  thinking I gotta, I gotta get a laptop that can tent

584
00:33:32,855 --> 00:33:36,515
Speaker 7:  let us know, you know, the, the email address is open. The, the phone lines

585
00:33:36,535 --> 00:33:37,595
Speaker 7:  are, are always ringing.

586
00:33:37,705 --> 00:33:40,515
Speaker 8:  This is the funny thing about this space to me, like I

587
00:33:42,035 --> 00:33:45,185
Speaker 8:  don't want more innovation in laptops, which

588
00:33:45,405 --> 00:33:46,905
Speaker 7:  Is kind of my question. Right. Maybe

589
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:49,545
Speaker 8:  An insane thing to say. But, but I think the thing I've come around to is

590
00:33:49,545 --> 00:33:52,905
Speaker 8:  like, I think laptops are just a solved problem. Like I think we've, 'cause

591
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:56,425
Speaker 8:  we've been at this for a while and there had been a lot of ideas. There was

592
00:33:56,425 --> 00:33:59,505
Speaker 8:  this time, I think it was, it was either Acer or Asus. I think it was Acer

593
00:33:59,855 --> 00:34:02,865
Speaker 8:  flipped the track pad and the keyboard. Do you remember this when Oh yeah.

594
00:34:02,865 --> 00:34:03,705
Speaker 8:  They had, they made a thing where

595
00:34:03,705 --> 00:34:06,225
Speaker 7:  Yeah, keyboard in the front club. We used, we did, this was a recurring segment

596
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:08,505
Speaker 7:  on this show. Yeah. It was whole thing. Miller would be like, keyboard in

597
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:11,385
Speaker 7:  the front club. Here's another one of these. Yeah. It was like, there was,

598
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:14,025
Speaker 7:  that was the closest to success this concept has ever gotten.

599
00:34:14,805 --> 00:34:18,105
Speaker 8:  And then everything got really flippy and then every, the razor was like,

600
00:34:18,105 --> 00:34:21,065
Speaker 8:  what if they folded out? And Lenovo was like, what if it rises up out of

601
00:34:21,065 --> 00:34:24,985
Speaker 8:  nowhere And, and everybody is like, no, actually what if the battery

602
00:34:25,085 --> 00:34:28,765
Speaker 8:  lasted longer? Like, what if it was just laptop but

603
00:34:29,115 --> 00:34:32,845
Speaker 8:  battery and then like, and I think that's fine. Like we're,

604
00:34:32,845 --> 00:34:36,605
Speaker 8:  we're what, we're 30 years into laptops now. Like I think, I think we can

605
00:34:36,605 --> 00:34:39,885
Speaker 8:  look at those and be like, okay, this is, we know what this thing is supposed

606
00:34:39,885 --> 00:34:42,605
Speaker 8:  to be. Let's leave it alone and go do something else. And where I am with

607
00:34:42,605 --> 00:34:45,645
Speaker 8:  tablets is like, I just don't think we're there yet. So I push harder on

608
00:34:45,645 --> 00:34:48,685
Speaker 8:  that. 'cause I'm like, we can't, we have not finished what this thing is

609
00:34:48,805 --> 00:34:52,725
Speaker 8:  supposed to be, but with laptops, I'm like, I think the MacBook Air is

610
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:56,845
Speaker 8:  probably my longest held like default recommendation

611
00:34:57,505 --> 00:35:00,355
Speaker 8:  that is like, If you just want a laptop and I don't want to have any more

612
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,955
Speaker 8:  questions for you, I'm gonna tell you to buy a MacBook Air. And that's been

613
00:35:02,955 --> 00:35:05,975
Speaker 8:  true for 10 years. I can't even, any

614
00:35:05,975 --> 00:35:08,255
Speaker 7:  Other place, I can't say saying that with affection or disdain. Like If you

615
00:35:08,255 --> 00:35:10,575
Speaker 7:  wanna get the fuck outta my face, buy a MacBook Air,

616
00:35:11,255 --> 00:35:13,255
Speaker 8:  I have a MacBook Air that I love to pieces like

617
00:35:13,685 --> 00:35:13,975
Speaker 7:  It's,

618
00:35:13,975 --> 00:35:17,615
Speaker 8:  It's, it's affection. Like, and it has been, I think it's, it's frankly

619
00:35:17,685 --> 00:35:20,495
Speaker 8:  kind of damning of the rest of the PC industry that nobody else has figured

620
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:23,735
Speaker 8:  out that what people actually want is a laptop that is like light and thin

621
00:35:23,735 --> 00:35:24,695
Speaker 8:  and lasts a really long time.

622
00:35:25,395 --> 00:35:29,175
Speaker 7:  No wait to be, to be fair, they have, they just have horrible branding

623
00:35:29,175 --> 00:35:32,935
Speaker 7:  problems, right? Like what is the default Windows laptop that

624
00:35:32,935 --> 00:35:36,215
Speaker 7:  competes with the microcare is a rich topic of discussion. Sure. And the

625
00:35:36,215 --> 00:35:36,895
Speaker 7:  problem is it's the Dell

626
00:35:37,305 --> 00:35:38,245
Speaker 8:  XPS 13, which they killed,

627
00:35:38,485 --> 00:35:41,205
Speaker 7:  Which is gone. Right. They just won't like stick to a brand that makes sense

628
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,725
Speaker 7:  now they're like, here's what it's called. It's called the Double Dell Pro

629
00:35:44,065 --> 00:35:47,805
Speaker 7:  and it comes with a side of fries. And you're like, I don't want that. Like,

630
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:51,125
Speaker 7:  I don't understand Sure what this is. You know, HP

631
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:54,485
Speaker 7:  had a line of computers that we thought would be the, they changed the logo

632
00:35:54,505 --> 00:35:58,085
Speaker 7:  and they're like, now that's gone. And Apple to its credit radically changes

633
00:35:58,085 --> 00:36:01,855
Speaker 7:  the product over time, but it does just slowly iterate the products in the

634
00:36:01,855 --> 00:36:03,895
Speaker 7:  same names. And you can argue about whether there's too many products or

635
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:07,655
Speaker 7:  too whatever, but like they've just built brand equity in the name.

636
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:10,735
Speaker 7:  So much so that Johnny and I have tried to kill the MacBook Air and he couldn't.

637
00:36:11,145 --> 00:36:14,175
Speaker 7:  Right. If you will recall, because, well, and

638
00:36:14,175 --> 00:36:18,095
Speaker 8:  Again, they tried to make huge changes to how a laptop works and it

639
00:36:18,095 --> 00:36:20,815
Speaker 8:  sucked. They're like, what if your laptop didn't have any ports and the keyboard

640
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:23,415
Speaker 8:  was bad so that we could make it thinner? And everybody said, no thank you.

641
00:36:23,565 --> 00:36:27,295
Speaker 8:  Like we just figured it out. Yeah. We know what this thing is

642
00:36:27,455 --> 00:36:28,135
Speaker 8:  supposed to be. Again,

643
00:36:28,135 --> 00:36:30,655
Speaker 7:  This, this was kind of my question about all this. For a thousand dollars,

644
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:34,055
Speaker 7:  a 13 inch medical error, it, it seems

645
00:36:34,645 --> 00:36:37,455
Speaker 7:  virtually impossible to compete with unless you need windows,

646
00:36:38,315 --> 00:36:41,305
Speaker 7:  right? Unless, unless there's something driving you to use Windows and then

647
00:36:41,305 --> 00:36:45,025
Speaker 7:  you have a huge menu of options. But there's not like all, even like,

648
00:36:45,865 --> 00:36:49,565
Speaker 7:  should Apple put a touchscreen on this thing? Is like I, yes, I think, I

649
00:36:49,565 --> 00:36:53,285
Speaker 7:  think they should merge iPad OS and Macs and they won't. They're just not

650
00:36:53,285 --> 00:36:56,885
Speaker 7:  gonna, they're gonna sell you a weird iPad error and they're gonna sell you

651
00:36:56,885 --> 00:37:00,005
Speaker 7:  a MacBook Air and that's fine. And I, there's something about this one in

652
00:37:00,005 --> 00:37:02,925
Speaker 7:  particular where they, they revved it a little and they brought the price

653
00:37:02,995 --> 00:37:06,525
Speaker 7:  down and they added some ram, which I think you should turn off Apple intelligence

654
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:10,165
Speaker 7:  and take advantage of that. It just makes this MacBook

655
00:37:10,305 --> 00:37:14,005
Speaker 7:  Air like a particularly strong expression of it, of

656
00:37:14,005 --> 00:37:17,525
Speaker 7:  Apple's dominance of this particular price point. I totally, I think it's

657
00:37:17,525 --> 00:37:19,805
Speaker 7:  very hard to compete at this price point with, with this new error.

658
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:24,125
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Yeah. It's as a, as a thousand dollars computer, it's about

659
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:27,165
Speaker 8:  as compelling as I think is possible to do at this moment in time.

660
00:37:27,385 --> 00:37:31,205
Speaker 7:  And that's why I think as a $2,200 computer, the new M three

661
00:37:31,225 --> 00:37:35,165
Speaker 7:  max studio is the one I'm gonna buy for no reason whatsoever. Okay.

662
00:37:35,165 --> 00:37:36,685
Speaker 7:  Okay. This, this thing is a deal.

663
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,325
Speaker 8:  I'm willing to have this conversation with you, but only If you can explain

664
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:43,205
Speaker 8:  to me what the hell is going on with the chips in the New Max Studios.

665
00:37:43,405 --> 00:37:45,885
Speaker 7:  I don't think they can make an M four Ultra. I think that's what's going

666
00:37:45,885 --> 00:37:49,845
Speaker 7:  on with the chips. The new the you, right? Like I think the way, the

667
00:37:49,845 --> 00:37:53,645
Speaker 7:  way these chips work or, and I think their names are getting a little

668
00:37:54,115 --> 00:37:54,725
Speaker 7:  confusing.

669
00:37:55,985 --> 00:37:57,195
Speaker 8:  Just a little. Yeah.

670
00:37:57,565 --> 00:38:00,635
Speaker 7:  Right. Because I, what's, what's the difference between an M1 PRO and M1

671
00:38:00,635 --> 00:38:04,035
Speaker 7:  Max and M M1 ultra like, or no, M four, M three, like

672
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:08,475
Speaker 7:  what they are really, what they really mean is we have fused

673
00:38:09,015 --> 00:38:12,915
Speaker 7:  two or four chips together. And so there's something there that is too

674
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:15,915
Speaker 7:  confusing for people to understand because the way that's expressed is in

675
00:38:15,915 --> 00:38:19,395
Speaker 7:  core counts. So you're like, I will configure an M three

676
00:38:19,685 --> 00:38:23,355
Speaker 7:  Ultra max studio and your choices are 28 core

677
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:27,195
Speaker 7:  CPU 60 core GPU 32 core neural engine

678
00:38:27,455 --> 00:38:31,435
Speaker 7:  or 32 core CPU 80 core GPU 32 core

679
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:34,035
Speaker 7:  neural engine. And you're just like, I don't know what any of that means.

680
00:38:34,425 --> 00:38:38,405
Speaker 7:  That it's just, just like a meaningless set of numbers. Obviously

681
00:38:38,425 --> 00:38:42,305
Speaker 7:  one is more than the other. But then you step back and

682
00:38:42,305 --> 00:38:46,145
Speaker 7:  you're like, the cheaper model is the M four max, which has a 14 core CPU

683
00:38:46,145 --> 00:38:49,865
Speaker 7:  and a 32 core GPU and a 16 quarter lunch. And you're like, oh, is this just

684
00:38:49,865 --> 00:38:52,765
Speaker 7:  half? But it's a totally different chip family.

685
00:38:54,505 --> 00:38:54,845
Speaker 7:  So like,

686
00:38:55,005 --> 00:38:57,085
Speaker 8:  I stopped listening so long, I'm really sorry. It

687
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,725
Speaker 7:  Just none out hard. None of this makes sense anymore. They should change

688
00:38:59,725 --> 00:39:03,685
Speaker 7:  these names because what you have is a chip family and

689
00:39:03,685 --> 00:39:07,645
Speaker 7:  you're taking the core chip and then you're literally fusing another one

690
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:11,165
Speaker 7:  onto it or then, or you're fusing two three more onto it. And

691
00:39:12,005 --> 00:39:14,725
Speaker 7:  I don't think that that tracks, that's not how people think of anything.

692
00:39:15,425 --> 00:39:19,235
Speaker 7:  No. Like what are the core capabilities of a single chip in the

693
00:39:19,235 --> 00:39:23,035
Speaker 7:  new M line versus three of the old one. You know, like I,

694
00:39:23,035 --> 00:39:26,995
Speaker 7:  that's literally no one outside of Apple's chip team thinks this way. It

695
00:39:26,995 --> 00:39:27,195
Speaker 7:  also,

696
00:39:27,195 --> 00:39:30,555
Speaker 8:  Like we've, we've spent a lot of time trying to figure out the sort of internal

697
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:34,555
Speaker 8:  math of Apple's naming system and the fact that the fact that Ultra is more

698
00:39:34,555 --> 00:39:38,515
Speaker 8:  than Max Got it good on that. But the fact that Ultra is so much

699
00:39:38,515 --> 00:39:42,475
Speaker 8:  more than Max, that ultra on the last gen outweighs max on this gen.

700
00:39:42,495 --> 00:39:46,155
Speaker 8:  So that a M three ultra is more than an M four max complicated.

701
00:39:46,515 --> 00:39:46,795
Speaker 8:  I don't

702
00:39:46,795 --> 00:39:49,955
Speaker 7:  Know. I I just tuned you out too. Okay. Here's what I, here's what I'm saying

703
00:39:49,955 --> 00:39:53,835
Speaker 7:  to you. As, as, as everyone knows, everyone

704
00:39:53,835 --> 00:39:56,875
Speaker 7:  in America is aware, I am thinking about buying a new computer

705
00:40:00,775 --> 00:40:00,995
Speaker 7:  as,

706
00:40:01,015 --> 00:40:03,795
Speaker 8:  As many was announced to you, cores. Are you in the

707
00:40:03,795 --> 00:40:07,155
Speaker 7:  Market for breaking news across every cable news station?

708
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:11,075
Speaker 7:  I have often considered buying a new computer. I

709
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,675
Speaker 8:  Think that was on 60 Minutes this weekend, right?

710
00:40:13,185 --> 00:40:16,315
Speaker 7:  Yeah, they did. They did that great John Oliver segment. And then I sat down

711
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:20,315
Speaker 7:  and was like, I dunno, you guys, it's a 2017 iMac. The fan

712
00:40:20,315 --> 00:40:22,035
Speaker 7:  runs all the time. What do you guys think?

713
00:40:23,635 --> 00:40:27,375
Speaker 7:  So I've been, I've been thinking about it. I I've solved a monitor problem,

714
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:31,015
Speaker 7:  which is I'm gonna buy a cheap monitor while I wait for the new studio display.

715
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,775
Speaker 7:  And in the meantime I might break one or more IMAX trying to convert it into

716
00:40:34,775 --> 00:40:35,055
Speaker 7:  a monitor.

717
00:40:35,715 --> 00:40:39,455
Speaker 8:  We got a couple of emails from people with non-car sounding solutions to

718
00:40:39,455 --> 00:40:41,495
Speaker 8:  that. By the way. We're gonna have to, we have some stuff to try.

719
00:40:41,725 --> 00:40:44,815
Speaker 7:  Okay. Well, well, that, that's a whole other show. So I'm like, I'm gonna

720
00:40:44,815 --> 00:40:48,015
Speaker 7:  buy this new Mac mini. So you open the configurator and what's the first

721
00:40:48,015 --> 00:40:50,895
Speaker 7:  thing you're gonna do? You're gonna, you're gonna upgrade to the M four Pro

722
00:40:50,895 --> 00:40:54,695
Speaker 7:  because obviously my Photoshop needs are

723
00:40:54,695 --> 00:40:55,055
Speaker 7:  intense.

724
00:40:55,725 --> 00:40:56,015
Speaker 8:  Sure.

725
00:40:56,735 --> 00:40:57,085
Speaker 7:  Right.

726
00:40:57,085 --> 00:40:58,005
Speaker 8:  There's a lot of filters.

727
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:58,725
Speaker 7:  I, I I,

728
00:40:58,725 --> 00:40:59,885
Speaker 8:  Photoshop and Patel they

729
00:40:59,885 --> 00:41:02,685
Speaker 7:  Call it. I take screenshots of David and I draw mustaches on his face every

730
00:41:02,685 --> 00:41:06,565
Speaker 7:  night and I need 20 GPU

731
00:41:06,565 --> 00:41:07,165
Speaker 7:  cores to do that.

732
00:41:08,795 --> 00:41:12,725
Speaker 7:  Sure. So then you're like, I'm, I'll stick with a base M four pro, I'm not

733
00:41:12,725 --> 00:41:15,645
Speaker 7:  gonna upgrade for $200 to the next step up. That's too much.

734
00:41:16,715 --> 00:41:20,495
Speaker 7:  But you're like, I can't sit here with 24 gigs of ram, so I'm gonna spend

735
00:41:20,495 --> 00:41:24,375
Speaker 7:  $400 on 48 gigs of ram because 36 is not offered for some

736
00:41:24,885 --> 00:41:28,615
Speaker 7:  bananas reason. And then you can't, five 12 gigs of storage

737
00:41:28,755 --> 00:41:32,255
Speaker 7:  is not acceptable. So you have to go to at least a terabyte. And then

738
00:41:33,385 --> 00:41:36,765
Speaker 7:  I'm not gonna sit here with a gigabit ethernet port. I'm gonna get 10 gigs

739
00:41:36,765 --> 00:41:40,605
Speaker 7:  of ethernet. My home network is 2.5. Right. So like, at the very

740
00:41:40,605 --> 00:41:42,845
Speaker 7:  least, I need that. And then one day I'm gonna get one of those crazy fiber

741
00:41:42,845 --> 00:41:46,365
Speaker 7:  connections. I gotta be ready for the future. I am at $2,100,

742
00:41:46,385 --> 00:41:47,285
Speaker 7:  2090 $9.

743
00:41:49,185 --> 00:41:52,875
Speaker 7:  I've configured a Mac to $2,100. Like

744
00:41:52,875 --> 00:41:53,355
Speaker 7:  instantly

745
00:41:54,115 --> 00:41:55,675
Speaker 8:  Checking really quick. What was your starting budget?

746
00:41:56,175 --> 00:42:00,035
Speaker 7:  The starting budget of MAC is 5 99. So you can like blink

747
00:42:00,035 --> 00:42:02,875
Speaker 7:  at the MAC mini configurator and get it to be very expensive. Or you can

748
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:06,635
Speaker 7:  open the Mac Studio page and the base model Mac Studio is

749
00:42:06,635 --> 00:42:10,195
Speaker 7:  $2,000. You're like, it already has 36 gigs of ram.

750
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:13,875
Speaker 7:  I'll upgrade to a terabyte of storage. It already has a 10

751
00:42:14,535 --> 00:42:17,835
Speaker 7:  10 gigabit ethernet card. I don't need to upgrade this processor because

752
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:21,465
Speaker 7:  I don't know what any of these numbers mean. 2200

753
00:42:24,055 --> 00:42:27,695
Speaker 7:  I, I think this is an obvious choice. I, and I think America needs to know

754
00:42:28,355 --> 00:42:32,105
Speaker 7:  if the, I don't know. I look CVEs in a lot of trouble with Brennan

755
00:42:32,265 --> 00:42:35,865
Speaker 7:  Carr already, so I don't think they're gonna allow me to come on and configure

756
00:42:35,865 --> 00:42:37,465
Speaker 7:  a Mac, but I'm open to it.

757
00:42:37,495 --> 00:42:40,825
Speaker 8:  There's like a whole BizOps team at Apple that just got a raise listening

758
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:44,025
Speaker 8:  to this podcast. Like just that thing that you just said. They're like, well

759
00:42:44,025 --> 00:42:46,385
Speaker 8:  we did it. We have, we have one. I

760
00:42:46,385 --> 00:42:49,385
Speaker 7:  Do, I do tend to keep computers for a long time. Like I,

761
00:42:50,575 --> 00:42:54,365
Speaker 7:  they, they sit on the deck. I mean this is why I'm thinking about, I mean

762
00:42:54,385 --> 00:42:58,345
Speaker 7:  I'm gonna find a way to justify this Mac Studio, but I

763
00:42:58,345 --> 00:43:01,665
Speaker 7:  think this is a staggering deal for the Mac Studio. Which version was the

764
00:43:01,665 --> 00:43:05,465
Speaker 7:  staggering deal? The M four max with 10 gigabit. Yeah, the M four max is

765
00:43:05,465 --> 00:43:07,985
Speaker 7:  basically already configured. The only upgrade you really should do is to

766
00:43:08,025 --> 00:43:11,825
Speaker 7:  a terabyte of storage. 'cause five 12 is like, it's almost like

767
00:43:12,275 --> 00:43:16,145
Speaker 7:  we're getting to the point where If you do enough stuff on a computer, just

768
00:43:16,245 --> 00:43:20,145
Speaker 7:  the system and then like swap the internal drive in a bunch of applications.

769
00:43:20,145 --> 00:43:23,265
Speaker 7:  We'll eat up five 12. Yeah. So you should go to a terabyte. Yeah. By the

770
00:43:23,265 --> 00:43:26,545
Speaker 7:  way, I mostly do emails in Slack. I'm just saying

771
00:43:28,645 --> 00:43:31,425
Speaker 7:  I'm gonna convince myself to buy this computer. I think it's like truly,

772
00:43:31,545 --> 00:43:34,825
Speaker 7:  I think like compared to specking up

773
00:43:35,545 --> 00:43:38,225
Speaker 7:  a Mac Mini, which a lot of people love to do, or

774
00:43:39,505 --> 00:43:42,785
Speaker 7:  I mean the Mac Pro at this point is just like completely off. Like I don't,

775
00:43:42,785 --> 00:43:44,665
Speaker 7:  I don't, I know what the point of that thing is right now. They need to update

776
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:46,705
Speaker 7:  that. Seriously. I'm impressed with this studio.

777
00:43:47,805 --> 00:43:50,865
Speaker 8:  The approval rating on the studio in general seems to be like through the

778
00:43:50,865 --> 00:43:53,585
Speaker 8:  roof. Like I don't, I don't know. I've never heard of anyone who bought a

779
00:43:53,585 --> 00:43:56,665
Speaker 8:  studio and is like bummed with the experience that they got from it. Yeah.

780
00:43:56,665 --> 00:43:58,705
Speaker 8:  Apple appears to have like really gotten this thing right.

781
00:43:59,225 --> 00:44:00,705
Speaker 7:  I mean, I I should just buy one here on the show.

782
00:44:02,385 --> 00:44:05,705
Speaker 8:  I think you can expense it If you buy it live. I buy on The Vergecast. Right.

783
00:44:05,705 --> 00:44:05,905
Speaker 8:  And

784
00:44:06,145 --> 00:44:09,305
Speaker 7:  None how that works. It is strange. They rev the Mac studio so deeply and

785
00:44:09,305 --> 00:44:12,905
Speaker 7:  they haven't touched the Mac Pro, which is now just running an M two Ultra.

786
00:44:13,585 --> 00:44:15,605
Speaker 7:  But I guess it's, If you need PCI slots,

787
00:44:15,955 --> 00:44:18,725
Speaker 8:  That thing is eventually it's just, it's gonna be a studio with more slots.

788
00:44:18,725 --> 00:44:21,005
Speaker 8:  Like it kind of already is a studio with more slots. That's, that's basically

789
00:44:21,005 --> 00:44:24,045
Speaker 8:  what works. And that's fine. There will be a few people who need that.

790
00:44:24,525 --> 00:44:28,045
Speaker 7:  A cooling system designed for Intel chips that required nuclear power, like

791
00:44:28,115 --> 00:44:31,325
Speaker 7:  Yeah, sure. It is very funny. And by the way, in all of this

792
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:34,205
Speaker 7:  that, you know, we've talked about Apple intelligence so much like the entire

793
00:44:34,305 --> 00:44:38,285
Speaker 7:  AI revolution is running on giant Nvidia cards and Apple and

794
00:44:38,285 --> 00:44:42,245
Speaker 7:  Nvidia hate each other. And there's a very obvious thing for the

795
00:44:42,265 --> 00:44:46,085
Speaker 7:  Mac Pro to be able to do and they will never do it. Like

796
00:44:46,085 --> 00:44:50,045
Speaker 7:  there's just a personality conflict that will prevent the one Mac that can

797
00:44:50,045 --> 00:44:53,605
Speaker 7:  accept PCI cards from plugging an NVIDIA card into it.

798
00:44:53,945 --> 00:44:57,805
Speaker 7:  And they will, it will never happen. Like they will add touchscreens

799
00:44:57,805 --> 00:45:01,565
Speaker 7:  to Mac and put Mac OS on an iPad two decades before they

800
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:04,925
Speaker 7:  allow Nvidia hardware to run their computer. Like it's just never gonna,

801
00:45:05,525 --> 00:45:09,445
Speaker 7:  everyone has to be dead. Like generations of people have to be dead

802
00:45:09,545 --> 00:45:11,805
Speaker 7:  before Apple and Nvidia can bend their fences. I

803
00:45:11,805 --> 00:45:15,245
Speaker 8:  Kind of think you're right. I like, I want to find some like would

804
00:45:15,255 --> 00:45:18,765
Speaker 8:  DraftKings take that bet on which one happens first? Because I would, I would

805
00:45:18,765 --> 00:45:22,125
Speaker 8:  very much enjoy being involved in that wager. But I think

806
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:24,685
Speaker 7:  You're right. It it's not small. There's a long version. Short version. The

807
00:45:24,685 --> 00:45:28,165
Speaker 7:  short version is, there were some aqui pros that Nvidia chips ages ago and

808
00:45:28,165 --> 00:45:31,805
Speaker 7:  Nvidia screwed up the thermals so that they would basically come

809
00:45:32,045 --> 00:45:35,805
Speaker 7:  unglued, un soldered inside the computers. Oh boy. And I think Nvidia wanted

810
00:45:35,805 --> 00:45:39,605
Speaker 7:  Apple to pay for it. And Apple obviously. And now never generations of people

811
00:45:39,605 --> 00:45:42,645
Speaker 7:  have to be dead. That's what I'm saying. Like your children's children may

812
00:45:42,705 --> 00:45:44,405
Speaker 7:  see an Apple computer Nvidia trip.

813
00:45:45,115 --> 00:45:45,605
Speaker 8:  Fair enough.

814
00:45:45,885 --> 00:45:48,845
Speaker 7:  I mean, I should just find one right now. By the way, the maxed out Mac Studio

815
00:45:49,025 --> 00:45:50,285
Speaker 7:  is $14,000.

816
00:45:50,875 --> 00:45:53,165
Speaker 8:  That feels low. Like I'm That seems fine.

817
00:45:53,325 --> 00:45:54,005
Speaker 7:  You're like, let's do it.

818
00:45:54,155 --> 00:45:57,845
Speaker 8:  Yeah. That, that and the new MacBook Air, they're deals. They're

819
00:45:57,845 --> 00:45:58,725
Speaker 7:  Deals, nothing but a deal.

820
00:45:58,875 --> 00:46:02,845
Speaker 8:  512 gigs of unified memory on the Max

821
00:46:02,845 --> 00:46:03,125
Speaker 8:  Studio.

822
00:49:37,005 --> 00:49:40,925
Speaker 8:  I think on a, on a tablet, 64 Ks is actually basically

823
00:49:40,925 --> 00:49:43,845
Speaker 8:  fine. Like, what are you downloading under your fucking iPad movies?

824
00:49:44,345 --> 00:49:48,245
Speaker 7:  No, no, you're wrong. Wait until your kid needs to take a plane

825
00:49:48,245 --> 00:49:49,285
Speaker 7:  with an iPad. Yeah,

826
00:49:49,305 --> 00:49:53,245
Speaker 8:  She doesn't need 4K. Yeah, that's Bluey Is is AO K at four 80?

827
00:49:53,425 --> 00:49:53,765
Speaker 8:  Do you know

828
00:49:53,825 --> 00:49:57,765
Speaker 7:  How many episodes of Bluey there are? Do you know how many episodes Ofaw

829
00:49:57,765 --> 00:50:01,285
Speaker 7:  patrol? They are. Have you ever sat with a 6-year-old and argued about which

830
00:50:01,285 --> 00:50:04,365
Speaker 7:  episodes Ofaw patrol to put on their iPad before a 90 minute flight?

831
00:50:05,575 --> 00:50:09,035
Speaker 7:  You're just like, all of 'em, just all of just give the library and that's

832
00:50:09,035 --> 00:50:11,275
Speaker 8:  I'm I'm done with this conversation. That's why. Yeah, all the kids, they,

833
00:50:11,275 --> 00:50:14,675
Speaker 8:  they're supposed to get the $350 iPad. They end up getting one terabyte of

834
00:50:14,675 --> 00:50:17,355
Speaker 8:  storage. It's real preloaded Paw Patrol.

835
00:50:17,965 --> 00:50:21,275
Speaker 7:  We're back, everybody. We're back. We're just, it just rolled right in. That's,

836
00:50:21,375 --> 00:50:24,395
Speaker 7:  people wonder what happens between the segments while someone else reads

837
00:50:24,395 --> 00:50:25,915
Speaker 7:  the ads. That's what happens.

838
00:50:28,485 --> 00:50:30,925
Speaker 7:  All right. We got a tech lightning round. There's actually quite a lot of

839
00:50:31,255 --> 00:50:34,535
Speaker 7:  small tech news. I I wanna start with this one because

840
00:50:35,105 --> 00:50:39,015
Speaker 7:  David, I feel like we've run the Dig is back story 50 times.

841
00:50:40,295 --> 00:50:41,265
Speaker 8:  It's probably right. Yeah,

842
00:50:41,415 --> 00:50:44,825
Speaker 7:  It's been back several times. If you recall, dig was one of the early sort

843
00:50:44,825 --> 00:50:48,225
Speaker 7:  of news aggregators when I worked at Eng Gadget a million years ago.

844
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:52,105
Speaker 7:  We would argue about what stories should get a dig badge. So if we saw that

845
00:50:52,105 --> 00:50:55,425
Speaker 7:  like traffic was like going up on a story, we'd put the dig badge on it.

846
00:50:55,425 --> 00:50:59,065
Speaker 7:  And the reason we'd argue about it was, I, I believe the dig badge at the

847
00:50:59,065 --> 00:51:02,425
Speaker 7:  time was a flash object, so it would slow down the entire

848
00:51:02,615 --> 00:51:03,105
Speaker 7:  website.

849
00:51:04,025 --> 00:51:04,845
Speaker 8:  Oh wow. But we'd be like,

850
00:51:04,965 --> 00:51:07,085
Speaker 7:  We're getting a lot of dig traffic. Like it's worth

851
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:11,525
Speaker 8:  Dig did send a lot of traffic. Like it was a real, it had a a pretty long

852
00:51:11,585 --> 00:51:15,325
Speaker 8:  run there of If you were at the top of the Dig homepage, like it,

853
00:51:15,385 --> 00:51:16,445
Speaker 8:  it crashed websites

854
00:51:16,825 --> 00:51:19,405
Speaker 7:  And you'd want to game it. So If you saw that you're getting some traction,

855
00:51:20,175 --> 00:51:23,565
Speaker 7:  you'd be like, we should put the dig badge on this story so people can click.

856
00:51:23,845 --> 00:51:27,615
Speaker 7:  I, you know, I dig it. There are some of you listening have no idea

857
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:31,335
Speaker 7:  what we're talking about, but like, it was like Reddit, it was a meaningful

858
00:51:31,335 --> 00:51:34,615
Speaker 7:  competitor Reddit at one point in time, and then it went away,

859
00:51:35,115 --> 00:51:39,095
Speaker 7:  and now Alexis Ohanian, founder of Reddit, maybe gonna bring it back

860
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:41,215
Speaker 7:  with founder Kevin Rose and David, you talk to them.

861
00:51:41,725 --> 00:51:45,695
Speaker 8:  Yeah. So the, the one difference between the many comebacks

862
00:51:45,695 --> 00:51:48,655
Speaker 8:  of Dig and this comeback of Dig is that this is the first one that Kevin Rose

863
00:51:48,755 --> 00:51:52,695
Speaker 8:  who created Dig is actually doing. So there's something meaningful

864
00:51:52,695 --> 00:51:55,335
Speaker 8:  there, and he is doing it with Alexis Ohanian, who's the co-founder of Reddit.

865
00:51:55,595 --> 00:51:55,815
Speaker 8:  And

866
00:51:57,925 --> 00:52:01,215
Speaker 8:  it's really interesting because talking to them about it, it's basically

867
00:52:01,215 --> 00:52:05,055
Speaker 8:  like Kevin in particular has been, has had many opportunities to do

868
00:52:05,075 --> 00:52:08,975
Speaker 8:  Dig Again, and I think for a variety of reasons, chose not

869
00:52:08,975 --> 00:52:12,815
Speaker 8:  to, but they are all all in on AI and,

870
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:16,415
Speaker 8:  and the idea that it can be a, a tool for helping

871
00:52:16,415 --> 00:52:19,895
Speaker 8:  moderators do stuff and helping sort content and helping like

872
00:52:20,215 --> 00:52:23,095
Speaker 8:  summarize stuff and help people build stuff within these communities. Like

873
00:52:23,675 --> 00:52:27,295
Speaker 8:  the, the next turn for social networking is

874
00:52:27,295 --> 00:52:30,455
Speaker 8:  basically like, what if we were nice to our users, which is a surprisingly

875
00:52:30,845 --> 00:52:34,775
Speaker 8:  rare thing in the social world right now, and what if we were able

876
00:52:34,775 --> 00:52:38,535
Speaker 8:  to build the tools that moderators in particular actually need?

877
00:52:39,455 --> 00:52:41,935
Speaker 8:  I think the theory is super interesting and there are definitely a lot of

878
00:52:41,935 --> 00:52:45,135
Speaker 8:  people out there who have fond memories of digs, so they're gonna get to

879
00:52:45,135 --> 00:52:46,295
Speaker 8:  trade on that for a minute.

880
00:52:47,895 --> 00:52:51,635
Speaker 8:  But they're also, like, the thing they're trying to build is pretty unformed

881
00:52:51,855 --> 00:52:55,515
Speaker 8:  at the moment. It's very new. They're very early in trying to figure out

882
00:52:55,515 --> 00:52:59,495
Speaker 8:  what it is. But I like, I don't know, I'm curious about this in a way.

883
00:52:59,495 --> 00:53:00,735
Speaker 8:  I didn't expect to be, I

884
00:53:00,735 --> 00:53:04,615
Speaker 9:  Was a huge dig user back in the day. Loved it. It was, it was a, a really

885
00:53:04,615 --> 00:53:08,015
Speaker 9:  important website and I think really early to those sort of

886
00:53:09,355 --> 00:53:13,335
Speaker 9:  social news aggregation ideas, I I, I think one of the big

887
00:53:13,335 --> 00:53:17,215
Speaker 9:  reasons that it failed was that it wasn't Reddit. It didn't figure

888
00:53:17,275 --> 00:53:20,215
Speaker 9:  out the community element. Yep. And Reddit did.

889
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:25,095
Speaker 9:  And I think the problem that they're about to encounter is that what they're

890
00:53:25,165 --> 00:53:28,845
Speaker 9:  basically describing doing now is making it Reddit, but with some

891
00:53:29,065 --> 00:53:32,965
Speaker 9:  ai and the cool, maybe like, I

892
00:53:32,965 --> 00:53:36,285
Speaker 9:  love, I I, I have very, very fond memories of Dig,

893
00:53:37,825 --> 00:53:41,005
Speaker 9:  but it, it definitely sends a little, like you're saying unformed right now

894
00:53:41,065 --> 00:53:44,645
Speaker 9:  in terms of exactly how that pans out. But it is true, like Reddit

895
00:53:44,645 --> 00:53:48,165
Speaker 9:  moderators have a lot of challenges and it is a lot of work to keep those

896
00:53:48,165 --> 00:53:52,125
Speaker 9:  communities together and not breaking rules and happy. And I think If you

897
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:55,325
Speaker 9:  are able to take some of the friction away from that,

898
00:53:55,925 --> 00:53:58,645
Speaker 9:  maybe there is something they can do that makes it a little bit better and

899
00:53:58,645 --> 00:54:01,245
Speaker 9:  smarter. And obviously Alexis's involvement here,

900
00:54:02,465 --> 00:54:04,445
Speaker 9:  you know, gives a little bit of sheen to it.

901
00:54:04,785 --> 00:54:08,445
Speaker 8:  Do we think Reddit's good? This is the thing I think a lot about be, and

902
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:11,365
Speaker 8:  I'm sort of serious. I like, I think a, a real thing Reddit has going for

903
00:54:11,365 --> 00:54:15,325
Speaker 8:  it is that it is the only game in town in a, in a pretty meaningful way.

904
00:54:15,345 --> 00:54:18,085
Speaker 8:  If you want to do things like you can do on Reddit, there's really nowhere

905
00:54:18,085 --> 00:54:19,365
Speaker 8:  else to go. Wait,

906
00:54:20,045 --> 00:54:23,765
Speaker 7:  I disagree. Really? There's still a giant ecosystem of like old school

907
00:54:23,785 --> 00:54:27,525
Speaker 7:  forums that exists and there are like weird companies that run the

908
00:54:27,525 --> 00:54:31,405
Speaker 7:  underlying software. So like every car in the world has a forum.

909
00:54:32,065 --> 00:54:35,765
Speaker 8:  That's fair. But but like, If you want to, If you want to do

910
00:54:35,965 --> 00:54:39,005
Speaker 8:  a bunch of that in one place, I suppose, yeah, like If you wanna talk about

911
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:41,805
Speaker 8:  cars, there are other places to go. But I think part of the appeal of Reddit

912
00:54:42,065 --> 00:54:45,565
Speaker 8:  is that it is both a bunch of individual communities, but it kind of puts

913
00:54:45,565 --> 00:54:48,365
Speaker 8:  them together in a meaningful way. Yeah.

914
00:54:48,365 --> 00:54:51,965
Speaker 9:  Though I do wonder, like I I, I'm not, listen, there was a, a dig

915
00:54:51,965 --> 00:54:55,845
Speaker 9:  Reddit rivalry back in the day and I chose my side and my side lost. And

916
00:54:55,845 --> 00:54:59,165
Speaker 9:  so I've, I've still got a grudge there. I do wonder like

917
00:54:59,745 --> 00:55:03,645
Speaker 9:  how much Reddit users are using the Reddit homepage, the r slash

918
00:55:03,785 --> 00:55:04,405
Speaker 9:  all feed,

919
00:55:06,115 --> 00:55:10,085
Speaker 9:  whereas Dig, dig was a homepage. You visited the homepage, you know, if

920
00:55:10,085 --> 00:55:13,045
Speaker 9:  they lean into the, that again, that is a different type of product than

921
00:55:13,045 --> 00:55:16,925
Speaker 9:  Reddit where you were going to specific communities or curating a very

922
00:55:17,125 --> 00:55:21,085
Speaker 9:  specific subset of communities that speak to you. And I do think, you

923
00:55:21,085 --> 00:55:24,885
Speaker 9:  know, they have proven, you know, phenomenally strong at that. I, I, I think

924
00:55:24,885 --> 00:55:28,725
Speaker 9:  Reddit has like kind of come and gone time and again over the past like

925
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:32,605
Speaker 9:  decade and I feel like it's, you know, maybe stronger than ever right now.

926
00:55:33,785 --> 00:55:37,125
Speaker 9:  So I, I, I don't know. I would say that Reddit is good, is very good at what

927
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:40,645
Speaker 9:  it is doing. And I think it's kind of hard to beat, like Neli is, right?

928
00:55:41,225 --> 00:55:45,175
Speaker 9:  There are these super nerdy forums for specific niches, but a

929
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:49,095
Speaker 9:  lot of those forums now just take place on Reddit. And I, I think

930
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:52,335
Speaker 9:  for a mainstream audience, like there is nowhere else you can go.

931
00:55:52,545 --> 00:55:56,055
Speaker 7:  Right? So here's the company I'm obsessed with, it's called Vertical Scope.

932
00:55:56,055 --> 00:55:58,895
Speaker 7:  They're in Canada. They seem very sweet, I should get them onto Coder in

933
00:55:58,895 --> 00:56:02,855
Speaker 7:  some way. They own AAV s forum, which is why I think about them

934
00:56:02,855 --> 00:56:06,295
Speaker 7:  all the time. Oh yeah. Because AAVs Forum is the real thing. It, Reddit has

935
00:56:06,295 --> 00:56:09,735
Speaker 7:  not even bit into one ounce of what AAV s Forum represents. If you're like

936
00:56:09,735 --> 00:56:13,335
Speaker 7:  a home theater nerd, you're listening to the show, you know what a BS warm

937
00:56:13,335 --> 00:56:16,775
Speaker 7:  is, they also own toyota nation.com, ben's

938
00:56:16,775 --> 00:56:20,615
Speaker 7:  world.org, guitars 1 0 1 and something called i fish.net,

939
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:23,525
Speaker 7:  which is internet's hard fish,

940
00:56:23,525 --> 00:56:27,245
Speaker 8:  Especially like a two Truths and a lie kind of situation. Like one of these

941
00:56:27,265 --> 00:56:27,845
Speaker 8:  is not real.

942
00:56:28,075 --> 00:56:32,005
Speaker 7:  Also something called dog forums. It's real, they

943
00:56:32,005 --> 00:56:35,805
Speaker 7:  have 101 million monthly active users across the thing. They're not

944
00:56:35,895 --> 00:56:39,445
Speaker 7:  right. Like they're big. Yeah. It's 1200 sites that they run on their forums.

945
00:56:41,185 --> 00:56:45,125
Speaker 7:  But you're right, If you go to AVS form, there's not some connectivity

946
00:56:45,305 --> 00:56:49,125
Speaker 7:  to i fish.net, right? There's not this like overarching,

947
00:56:49,185 --> 00:56:52,525
Speaker 7:  I'm on a social platform that has subreddits. There's just this big software

948
00:56:52,525 --> 00:56:54,525
Speaker 7:  and then obviously what they do is they wanna ads across all that stuff.

949
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:58,005
Speaker 7:  I think that's really fascinating. And I think that really interesting thing

950
00:56:58,005 --> 00:57:01,925
Speaker 7:  about Dig and Jake, you, you were a dig user, so

951
00:57:01,965 --> 00:57:05,935
Speaker 7:  I, I want to like dig was about sending you away, right? It

952
00:57:05,935 --> 00:57:09,175
Speaker 7:  was about curating the internet and there's a quote in David's piece where

953
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:11,895
Speaker 7:  they're like, we don't want to be just like an RSS reader with a like button.

954
00:57:13,075 --> 00:57:16,775
Speaker 7:  Reddit is about the content on Reddit. Like yes, there are links on Reddit,

955
00:57:16,775 --> 00:57:20,615
Speaker 7:  yes, they embed YouTube videos, all this stuff. But Reddit is really about

956
00:57:20,715 --> 00:57:24,615
Speaker 7:  the stuff that is happening on Reddit. Totally. And a, a big problem

957
00:57:24,675 --> 00:57:28,055
Speaker 7:  for almost every sort of like curator of links in the internet now including

958
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:32,015
Speaker 7:  us, is that all of the action is on social platforms.

959
00:57:32,105 --> 00:57:35,175
Speaker 7:  There are not as many cool things on the web to link to as there used to

960
00:57:35,175 --> 00:57:35,255
Speaker 7:  be.

961
00:57:35,725 --> 00:57:36,815
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Which

962
00:57:36,815 --> 00:57:40,495
Speaker 7:  Is just a weird thing that is currently happening. And so like I wonder

963
00:57:40,715 --> 00:57:44,655
Speaker 7:  is the new dig, Jake, as you think about why you picked Dig in

964
00:57:44,655 --> 00:57:47,015
Speaker 7:  the first place, was it because it was aggregating the web and it was like

965
00:57:47,015 --> 00:57:49,095
Speaker 7:  showing all this stuff? Or is it 'cause there was a community on there?

966
00:57:49,595 --> 00:57:52,015
Speaker 9:  No, it was because it was aggregating the web, right? Like If you were a

967
00:57:52,015 --> 00:57:55,775
Speaker 9:  tech nerd, If you went to dig.com, you would get everything you needed

968
00:57:55,855 --> 00:57:58,775
Speaker 9:  to know. It was the place to be. And you know,

969
00:58:00,475 --> 00:58:04,295
Speaker 9:  it, it was, it was a light touch website, super fun to be on there, but it

970
00:58:04,295 --> 00:58:07,935
Speaker 9:  was not about community. Not at all. And I think again, like ultimately I

971
00:58:07,935 --> 00:58:11,455
Speaker 9:  think that was one of the reasons that they lost, right? Like, like AMAs

972
00:58:11,455 --> 00:58:15,335
Speaker 9:  could not have evolved on Dig in the way that

973
00:58:15,335 --> 00:58:19,095
Speaker 9:  they did on Reddit. And I think Reddit's ability to create those communities

974
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:22,975
Speaker 9:  and to have homegrown content is what empowered it to, you know,

975
00:58:22,975 --> 00:58:26,895
Speaker 9:  become so valuable and become such a special place. And so

976
00:58:26,895 --> 00:58:30,295
Speaker 9:  this new dig is, you know, we should say we have not seen it, right? Right

977
00:58:30,295 --> 00:58:33,895
Speaker 9:  now they just have like a landing page that says coming soon, there's supposed

978
00:58:33,895 --> 00:58:37,055
Speaker 9:  to be invites going out in the next few weeks or something like that. But

979
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:40,175
Speaker 9:  you know, we fundamentally dunno exactly where it's going to land

980
00:58:40,915 --> 00:58:44,775
Speaker 9:  on that spectrum between just being a news aggregator and

981
00:58:44,945 --> 00:58:47,855
Speaker 9:  being a more community centric, you know, Reddit type of thing.

982
00:58:49,235 --> 00:58:53,055
Speaker 9:  And I, I think just looking at the internet that exists

983
00:58:53,185 --> 00:58:57,175
Speaker 9:  today, it seems very unlikely that they would create something that is

984
00:58:57,175 --> 00:59:00,055
Speaker 9:  just, you know, the original version of Dig where it is just collecting a

985
00:59:00,055 --> 00:59:03,655
Speaker 9:  bunch of links and sending you out. Right? You sort of need that community

986
00:59:03,655 --> 00:59:06,855
Speaker 9:  element. And at that point it's like, okay, well where's the daylight between

987
00:59:07,245 --> 00:59:08,255
Speaker 9:  this and Reddit?

988
00:59:08,445 --> 00:59:12,255
Speaker 7:  It's AI tools for moderators. Yeah. David, did they tell you anything about

989
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:14,335
Speaker 7:  Federation or Social web or anything like that?

990
00:59:14,655 --> 00:59:18,215
Speaker 8:  I asked about that and the response was basically

991
00:59:19,005 --> 00:59:22,925
Speaker 8:  it's a thing that they're interested in, but it's so unsettled

992
00:59:22,925 --> 00:59:26,005
Speaker 8:  that it didn't make sense to buy into any particular

993
00:59:26,835 --> 00:59:29,335
Speaker 8:  system right now. Which I actually think is a pretty reasonable argument.

994
00:59:29,405 --> 00:59:33,055
Speaker 8:  Like, should you at some point want to be part of this

995
00:59:33,055 --> 00:59:36,735
Speaker 8:  federated system If you are dig and want to like build tools for

996
00:59:36,735 --> 00:59:37,975
Speaker 8:  communities? Yes.

997
00:59:39,515 --> 00:59:42,975
Speaker 8:  If you're a tiny team trying to get a product off the ground, should you

998
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:46,655
Speaker 8:  be making giant bets on Activity Pub or at Proto right now? Probably not.

999
00:59:46,925 --> 00:59:47,215
Speaker 8:  Yeah.

1000
00:59:47,915 --> 00:59:51,885
Speaker 7:  Did you see that? Tap Bots, which made Tweetbot, which was great,

1001
00:59:51,885 --> 00:59:55,605
Speaker 7:  and they made Ivory from Ason. They have a new one for Blue Sky called Phoenix

1002
00:59:55,605 --> 00:59:59,285
Speaker 7:  that they just announced. Oh yeah. And it's fascinating and they should,

1003
00:59:59,465 --> 01:00:02,445
Speaker 7:  but they're a small team and basically our entire announcement for their

1004
01:00:02,445 --> 01:00:06,335
Speaker 7:  Blue Sky app is like an apology. They're

1005
01:00:06,335 --> 01:00:09,175
Speaker 7:  like, we know you want us to keep doing ivory, but they were small so we're

1006
01:00:09,175 --> 01:00:11,975
Speaker 7:  gonna just like try this one and we don't know which one's gonna win, but

1007
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:15,015
Speaker 7:  we promise we're not abandoning this one. And I, I was reading, I felt really

1008
01:00:15,015 --> 01:00:18,015
Speaker 7:  bad for them. I was like, you don't have to apologize. Like, yeah, no one

1009
01:00:18,025 --> 01:00:21,855
Speaker 7:  knows what's gonna win. There's even a line in their post that's like,

1010
01:00:22,275 --> 01:00:25,215
Speaker 7:  we think Activity Pub is probably gonna win like over the long term, but

1011
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:27,455
Speaker 7:  Right. All the actions on Blue Sky right now, so we should probably make

1012
01:00:27,455 --> 01:00:30,815
Speaker 7:  an app for that. And like, it's like guys, everybody gets it. Every,

1013
01:00:31,235 --> 01:00:35,015
Speaker 7:  no one knows how this is gonna shake out. Like right. It, it

1014
01:00:35,015 --> 01:00:37,695
Speaker 7:  seems like it's, it will be the future in some way,

1015
01:00:38,985 --> 01:00:42,925
Speaker 7:  but it is true that all the users are using App Protocol

1016
01:00:43,545 --> 01:00:47,365
Speaker 7:  and all of the engineers like Activity Pub to win then that,

1017
01:00:47,625 --> 01:00:49,605
Speaker 7:  that's just gonna take a while for it to play out.

1018
01:00:49,875 --> 01:00:52,725
Speaker 8:  Yeah, it's tough. And I think it's the, the thing I'm hearing from a lot

1019
01:00:52,725 --> 01:00:55,925
Speaker 8:  of developers right now is, is that same kind of thing where it's like, okay,

1020
01:00:55,925 --> 01:00:59,845
Speaker 8:  I don't wanna build myself out of the possibility of doing

1021
01:00:59,845 --> 01:01:03,765
Speaker 8:  either of these things, but I also don't wanna spend a lot of resources

1022
01:01:03,935 --> 01:01:07,365
Speaker 8:  supporting them. Which I think right now is probably like the prudent way

1023
01:01:07,365 --> 01:01:08,085
Speaker 8:  to think about the internet.

1024
01:01:08,495 --> 01:01:10,525
Speaker 7:  Sorry, I'm just investigating what's on live phish.com,

1025
01:01:13,415 --> 01:01:17,345
Speaker 7:  just closing tabs and is fish.com It's the, the I fish forms. Like

1026
01:01:17,345 --> 01:01:17,505
Speaker 7:  if

1027
01:01:17,505 --> 01:01:20,465
Speaker 8:  Apple made a fish, it would be called the I Fish. That's, this is what we're

1028
01:01:20,465 --> 01:01:20,545
Speaker 8:  talking

1029
01:01:20,545 --> 01:01:24,505
Speaker 7:  About here. No, it's i fish.net. I'm sorry. I

1030
01:01:24,505 --> 01:01:26,865
Speaker 7:  fish.net is the world's biggest fishing form.

1031
01:01:27,015 --> 01:01:27,625
Speaker 8:  Fantastic.

1032
01:01:28,345 --> 01:01:31,155
Speaker 7:  I thought it was about keeping fish as as pets, but

1033
01:01:31,895 --> 01:01:34,915
Speaker 8:  That's a completely different community. It's not allowed on I Fish s a

1034
01:01:34,915 --> 01:01:35,915
Speaker 7:  Wildly different community.

1035
01:01:39,785 --> 01:01:43,245
Speaker 7:  That's my fish fish net. Some, some of, there's a there on the i phish.net

1036
01:01:43,265 --> 01:01:46,565
Speaker 7:  forums, there's, there's a sub forum called Life in General.

1037
01:01:47,525 --> 01:01:49,285
Speaker 7:  It has 1.3 million posts

1038
01:01:51,515 --> 01:01:52,165
Speaker 7:  just saying

1039
01:01:52,865 --> 01:01:56,365
Speaker 8:  People just wanna hang out. Like it turns out people just wanna hang out.

1040
01:01:56,365 --> 01:01:57,965
Speaker 7:  They didn't need any AI to do that.

1041
01:01:58,195 --> 01:02:01,885
Speaker 8:  Yeah. One more piece of news on this before we leave the, the social stuff

1042
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:05,605
Speaker 8:  behind. There was some news this week that Discord is potentially

1043
01:02:06,405 --> 01:02:09,965
Speaker 8:  starting to think about an IPO, which is kind of fascinating. Discord has

1044
01:02:09,965 --> 01:02:13,805
Speaker 8:  been through some weird ups and downs as a company over the years,

1045
01:02:14,265 --> 01:02:17,845
Speaker 8:  almost got a, was like kind of maybe sort of getting acquired by

1046
01:02:18,045 --> 01:02:22,005
Speaker 8:  Microsoft at one point that didn't happen. Has been, has

1047
01:02:22,005 --> 01:02:25,605
Speaker 8:  had lots of ups and downs for content reasons. It's a weird time to go public.

1048
01:02:26,915 --> 01:02:30,525
Speaker 9:  Strange. I feel like end result for Discord, given that like If you just

1049
01:02:30,525 --> 01:02:34,005
Speaker 9:  look at the trajectory of Slack, slack went public, it was public for like

1050
01:02:34,005 --> 01:02:37,565
Speaker 9:  30 seconds, didn't really go great and now they're owned by Salesforce

1051
01:02:37,965 --> 01:02:41,485
Speaker 9:  and it's like, it's fine. So I don't know, like

1052
01:02:41,715 --> 01:02:45,285
Speaker 9:  Discord is fundamentally the same thing, but like for gamers

1053
01:02:45,715 --> 01:02:49,445
Speaker 7:  They dis wait, neither Discord nor Slack enjoy that comparison.

1054
01:02:50,065 --> 01:02:52,445
Speaker 7:  No, they hate it. And you're like, guys, If you opened your apps,

1055
01:02:54,245 --> 01:02:57,885
Speaker 7:  so what Slack will tell you is yes, we yes, but we enterprise

1056
01:02:57,885 --> 01:03:00,445
Speaker 7:  authentication is right.

1057
01:03:00,745 --> 01:03:04,725
Speaker 9:  And so is is is the the gamer market bigger than the enterprise market? Like

1058
01:03:04,925 --> 01:03:05,045
Speaker 9:  I

1059
01:03:05,595 --> 01:03:08,605
Speaker 7:  Well it's, I think there's, as a meme, stocks a consumer market, so like

1060
01:03:08,605 --> 01:03:12,085
Speaker 7:  Discord If you, you know, it's just a big consumer market that might pay

1061
01:03:12,085 --> 01:03:12,965
Speaker 7:  them directly.

1062
01:03:14,905 --> 01:03:15,855
Speaker 9:  Right. That's true.

1063
01:03:16,195 --> 01:03:19,255
Speaker 7:  But yeah, I, I think we're, we're in the age of all of these social platforms

1064
01:03:19,465 --> 01:03:23,135
Speaker 7:  being like, we're companies or there's space here. Like

1065
01:03:23,415 --> 01:03:26,535
Speaker 7:  everyone is pretty frustrated with the four billionaires who run all communications

1066
01:03:26,555 --> 01:03:30,535
Speaker 7:  in America. What if, what if we tried? Right. And it

1067
01:03:30,535 --> 01:03:32,535
Speaker 7:  helps If you have a billionaire of your own like Alexis.

1068
01:03:33,045 --> 01:03:36,655
Speaker 8:  Yeah, a couple of them in fact. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I think that one of

1069
01:03:36,655 --> 01:03:39,495
Speaker 8:  the things that Kevin said about Dig, which I thought was really interesting

1070
01:03:39,495 --> 01:03:42,335
Speaker 8:  is like, I kept pressing on like, how big do you want this thing to be?

1071
01:03:43,395 --> 01:03:47,265
Speaker 8:  And they seem really interested in not trying to like,

1072
01:03:47,265 --> 01:03:50,985
Speaker 8:  deliberately not trying to go out and build another, you know, many billion

1073
01:03:50,985 --> 01:03:54,305
Speaker 8:  dollar gigantic company, which is like a thing you can say when you're already

1074
01:03:54,545 --> 01:03:58,105
Speaker 8:  fabulously wealthy from other means. Like this is the kind of thing that

1075
01:03:58,105 --> 01:04:01,945
Speaker 8:  they're like, maybe without the pressures of being a public company to go,

1076
01:04:02,725 --> 01:04:06,345
Speaker 8:  you know, screw over our users to please our shareholders, we can actually

1077
01:04:06,345 --> 01:04:10,105
Speaker 8:  do more interesting stuff. And so I think there is a real like boutiquey

1078
01:04:10,105 --> 01:04:12,785
Speaker 8:  nature to a lot of these projects that I think are really exciting.

1079
01:04:13,925 --> 01:04:17,065
Speaker 8:  And I think if, if the, if this dig thing goes well, it'll look like that

1080
01:04:17,065 --> 01:04:18,065
Speaker 8:  too. Would be my guess.

1081
01:04:18,295 --> 01:04:22,265
Speaker 7:  Once you go IPO then you have shareholders who want money. Right. And I,

1082
01:04:22,305 --> 01:04:25,945
Speaker 7:  I wonder how Discord will respond to that other stuff. Nothing has new phones

1083
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:27,505
Speaker 7:  that phone three A and three a pro.

1084
01:04:27,895 --> 01:04:29,505
Speaker 9:  I've seen the AI button on the side.

1085
01:04:29,725 --> 01:04:31,185
Speaker 7:  Oh, of course. Yeah, that's necessary.

1086
01:04:31,485 --> 01:04:34,345
Speaker 9:  That's, that's the big new feature is I think it's called the essential button.

1087
01:04:34,605 --> 01:04:38,505
Speaker 7:  That's not confusing at all. I feel like I, we put the nothing phone on the

1088
01:04:38,505 --> 01:04:41,785
Speaker 7:  list, but actually the phone I wanna talk about is this weird Korean prototype

1089
01:04:41,785 --> 01:04:44,905
Speaker 7:  that Alison saw at Mobile World Congress. Well, that's right. Like nothing

1090
01:04:44,905 --> 01:04:47,665
Speaker 7:  made another phone, you know, they, it

1091
01:04:47,825 --> 01:04:51,465
Speaker 8:  Does AI things. No, that's fair. I do think I, I left it off the list

1092
01:04:51,605 --> 01:04:55,185
Speaker 8:  for today because Allison and Don Preston, who are at MWC are gonna come

1093
01:04:55,185 --> 01:04:58,785
Speaker 8:  on the show on Tuesday to talk about all of this stuff. But I do agree the

1094
01:04:58,885 --> 01:05:02,465
Speaker 8:  AI phone is maybe the single most interesting gadget of the entire week.

1095
01:05:02,625 --> 01:05:06,395
Speaker 7:  Well I just, I mean it's nuts. Like it makes a

1096
01:05:06,395 --> 01:05:09,515
Speaker 7:  3D avatar of you and watches everything you do and then it fills out forms

1097
01:05:09,515 --> 01:05:13,195
Speaker 7:  in the internet for you, which is whatever apparently wants. Like people

1098
01:05:13,195 --> 01:05:16,275
Speaker 7:  look at forms of the internet and they freak out apparently just every day

1099
01:05:16,285 --> 01:05:19,645
Speaker 7:  panic in the streets, just throwing their hands in the air. I don't know

1100
01:05:19,645 --> 01:05:22,605
Speaker 7:  how to fill out these forms. We have to collect all of society's information

1101
01:05:23,425 --> 01:05:27,005
Speaker 7:  to make an avatar of myself that can do this. But it's wild 'cause the, the

1102
01:05:27,005 --> 01:05:29,885
Speaker 7:  screen on the front is bifurcated and on top of the screen is an avatar of

1103
01:05:30,045 --> 01:05:30,165
Speaker 7:  yourself.

1104
01:05:30,765 --> 01:05:34,725
Speaker 8:  I don't understand it. I'm looking at this picture now and the

1105
01:05:34,725 --> 01:05:38,125
Speaker 8:  more I look at it, the less it makes sense to me. Actually

1106
01:05:38,125 --> 01:05:40,525
Speaker 9:  Does this, yo, is is that a second screen?

1107
01:05:40,945 --> 01:05:41,925
Speaker 7:  I'm just gonna read you this paragraph.

1108
01:05:41,925 --> 01:05:42,445
Speaker 8:  Like what is happening?

1109
01:05:42,565 --> 01:05:45,405
Speaker 7:  The idea is that you go around downloading your personal data history from

1110
01:05:45,445 --> 01:05:49,365
Speaker 7:  websites like Meta and Google also your medical records and financial data.

1111
01:05:49,915 --> 01:05:53,725
Speaker 7:  This is encrypted into a quote personal knowledge graph that is broken up

1112
01:05:53,885 --> 01:05:57,485
Speaker 7:  and stored across multiple third party cloud servers that theoretically only

1113
01:05:57,485 --> 01:06:01,045
Speaker 7:  the owner of data can access. And then all of this

1114
01:06:01,745 --> 01:06:05,085
Speaker 7:  is used to make an AI avatar that acts as a virtual assistant.

1115
01:06:05,385 --> 01:06:07,325
Speaker 9:  It also looks like it's running Android six.

1116
01:06:11,255 --> 01:06:11,455
Speaker 7:  I mean

1117
01:06:13,155 --> 01:06:16,055
Speaker 7:  it really does. Part of the charm of MWC is like what version of Android

1118
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:16,615
Speaker 7:  is this really?

1119
01:06:16,915 --> 01:06:18,055
Speaker 9:  I'm so excited for this.

1120
01:06:19,515 --> 01:06:22,375
Speaker 7:  We, you should talk to Alison about all this on the show when she's on, but

1121
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:26,735
Speaker 7:  they, the company claims that in order to do the demo where they had the

1122
01:06:26,735 --> 01:06:29,775
Speaker 7:  phone buy car insurance, they actually bought a car.

1123
01:06:31,735 --> 01:06:33,495
Speaker 7:  I guess they keep buying the car insurance.

1124
01:06:33,805 --> 01:06:36,495
Speaker 8:  Okay. I actually respect the hell outta that. Yeah. That is like the most

1125
01:06:36,525 --> 01:06:38,255
Speaker 8:  insured car in the world now.

1126
01:06:38,555 --> 01:06:42,335
Speaker 7:  It all looks very silly. And then, you know, as with everything, there's

1127
01:06:42,395 --> 01:06:46,175
Speaker 7:  too good to be true element. They say this phone will be sold globally on

1128
01:06:46,175 --> 01:06:49,255
Speaker 7:  May 1st for $375. Sure. Man, I

1129
01:06:52,275 --> 01:06:54,295
Speaker 7:  I'm dying to hear what Allison, and don't have to say it when they're on

1130
01:06:54,295 --> 01:06:56,975
Speaker 7:  the show, but it truly may be the most interesting gadget of the week.

1131
01:06:57,565 --> 01:07:01,415
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I I I agree. I guarantee we will never see it again. But

1132
01:07:01,435 --> 01:07:04,015
Speaker 8:  I'm glad we saw it once. And that comes for something, the

1133
01:07:04,015 --> 01:07:07,735
Speaker 7:  Best part of the whole thing is that I guess in Korea they did

1134
01:07:08,055 --> 01:07:11,735
Speaker 7:  a blockchain based vaccine record system, but

1135
01:07:11,735 --> 01:07:15,095
Speaker 7:  crypto is so toxic that they apologized for it in the briefing.

1136
01:07:15,605 --> 01:07:16,095
Speaker 8:  Good lord.

1137
01:07:16,935 --> 01:07:20,615
Speaker 7:  And they're like, it's not a cryptocurrency, it's just a database.

1138
01:07:20,645 --> 01:07:21,455
Speaker 7:  It's really slow.

1139
01:07:24,015 --> 01:07:27,905
Speaker 7:  Very good. Volkswagen Id dot everyone, which is

1140
01:07:28,285 --> 01:07:32,185
Speaker 7:  one of the worst names ever. Volkswagen's new ev it's

1141
01:07:32,185 --> 01:07:36,145
Speaker 7:  super cheap. And Sean Kain, former VERGE Transportation reporter

1142
01:07:36,495 --> 01:07:39,545
Speaker 7:  says it's gonna be the first Volkswagen to run Rivian software. If you remember,

1143
01:07:39,745 --> 01:07:42,385
Speaker 7:  Volkswagen invested a ton of money in Rivian. They spun off some weird middle

1144
01:07:42,385 --> 01:07:45,825
Speaker 7:  company that makes software for both companies. And here we are the first

1145
01:07:45,975 --> 01:07:49,345
Speaker 7:  it's 20,000 euros or $2,100.

1146
01:07:50,535 --> 01:07:53,625
Speaker 7:  It's cute. And I think the idea that it's running Rivian software is super

1147
01:07:53,905 --> 01:07:54,105
Speaker 7:  fascinating.

1148
01:07:54,105 --> 01:07:55,905
Speaker 9:  You've used it How is Rivian software?

1149
01:07:56,645 --> 01:08:00,545
Speaker 7:  It wasn't enough to get me to buy Rivian. Yeah. You know, like, I'm

1150
01:08:00,545 --> 01:08:03,985
Speaker 7:  like a fancy car person. I, I like, you know, I'm older now. What about

1151
01:08:03,985 --> 01:08:06,945
Speaker 8:  A rivian for a fifth of the price though? Yeah. Like that to me is the whole

1152
01:08:06,945 --> 01:08:10,425
Speaker 8:  story of this thing. Right? It's it's, it's the $20,000 of it all that makes

1153
01:08:10,425 --> 01:08:11,265
Speaker 8:  this thing interesting.

1154
01:08:11,365 --> 01:08:14,985
Speaker 7:  That's true. Like a rivian. Right now you buy an R one, it's like a hundred

1155
01:08:15,365 --> 01:08:18,325
Speaker 7:  thousand dollars and it's like there's no software that will get me to spend

1156
01:08:18,325 --> 01:08:21,125
Speaker 7:  that much money in a car. Right. But on a much cheaper car, like the R three

1157
01:08:21,165 --> 01:08:24,645
Speaker 7:  X like I, I basically have convinced myself that I'll buy an R three X when

1158
01:08:24,645 --> 01:08:27,445
Speaker 7:  it comes out 'cause it's cute and it'll be cheaper. Yeah. This is very much

1159
01:08:27,445 --> 01:08:30,485
Speaker 7:  in the same mode. You know, Vivian's whole thing is the same as Tesla's whole

1160
01:08:30,485 --> 01:08:34,085
Speaker 7:  thing or whatever. Instead of having tons and tons of subsystems in the car,

1161
01:08:34,395 --> 01:08:37,885
Speaker 7:  they just have one or I think it's now they're down to some small single

1162
01:08:37,895 --> 01:08:41,405
Speaker 7:  digit number of compute units. So they basically have built a computer in

1163
01:08:41,405 --> 01:08:44,525
Speaker 7:  the car. They've rearchitected how the cars work, which is the point of all

1164
01:08:44,525 --> 01:08:47,165
Speaker 7:  that software. So that's what Volkswagen is really investing in. 'cause their

1165
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:51,125
Speaker 7:  attempts to this were a disaster. Like famous in

1166
01:08:51,125 --> 01:08:54,485
Speaker 7:  corporate history level disaster. Volkswagen trying to do its own software.

1167
01:08:54,595 --> 01:08:54,885
Speaker 7:  What

1168
01:08:54,885 --> 01:08:58,605
Speaker 8:  I can't figure out about the, the id everyone, which again, like you undersold

1169
01:08:58,625 --> 01:09:00,045
Speaker 8:  how stupid a name that is for a

1170
01:09:00,045 --> 01:09:02,405
Speaker 7:  Car, it's so bad. It's in all caps and one is a number.

1171
01:09:02,475 --> 01:09:05,685
Speaker 8:  Yeah. It's awful. What, what is the thing that, by

1172
01:09:05,685 --> 01:09:08,245
Speaker 7:  The way, there's another one called the ID two all but

1173
01:09:09,765 --> 01:09:11,105
Speaker 7:  all is in lowercase

1174
01:09:11,255 --> 01:09:12,345
Speaker 8:  Something. So

1175
01:09:12,645 --> 01:09:16,105
Speaker 7:  ID is an uppercase dot two number lowercase all

1176
01:09:16,255 --> 01:09:20,105
Speaker 8:  Something about EVs has made everyone at auto companies

1177
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:24,225
Speaker 8:  lose their minds. They're like, what if all the designs were insane

1178
01:09:24,685 --> 01:09:28,465
Speaker 8:  as if they were from thousands of years from now and they were named

1179
01:09:28,465 --> 01:09:30,425
Speaker 8:  completely incomprehensible things.

1180
01:09:31,085 --> 01:09:34,745
Speaker 7:  So I understand it on the design front. I I really do because

1181
01:09:35,285 --> 01:09:38,945
Speaker 7:  If you are building an ev you really want a low coefficient of drag. So you

1182
01:09:38,945 --> 01:09:42,345
Speaker 7:  get all these weird Tylenol capsules just floating down the highways

1183
01:09:43,285 --> 01:09:46,745
Speaker 7:  and then you don't have to build a engine or you, you don't need an engine

1184
01:09:46,745 --> 01:09:50,065
Speaker 7:  bay the way you need it to before. You don't need a transmission tunnel down

1185
01:09:50,065 --> 01:09:53,825
Speaker 7:  the center of the car. Like, you just get to, you have a skateboard and you're

1186
01:09:53,825 --> 01:09:57,345
Speaker 7:  like, what crazy stuff can we do? And the designers at Hyundai were like

1187
01:09:57,545 --> 01:09:59,505
Speaker 7:  a lot of crazy stuff. Yeah. Actually

1188
01:10:01,585 --> 01:10:05,325
Speaker 7:  the names are, I don't, there's no logical reason for the names to be this

1189
01:10:05,325 --> 01:10:08,925
Speaker 7:  bad across the board and they're, they are very bad.

1190
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:13,125
Speaker 8:  But is the, is there something magical and repeatable about this? That it

1191
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:16,925
Speaker 8:  is $20,000? Like, it, it feels to me like it should be a bigger deal

1192
01:10:16,925 --> 01:10:19,405
Speaker 8:  that somebody is actually able to make this thing at this price.

1193
01:10:20,365 --> 01:10:24,245
Speaker 7:  I think the real story here, and I'm just, I'm just taking a shot,

1194
01:10:25,065 --> 01:10:28,325
Speaker 7:  is Rivian already built the software and

1195
01:10:28,765 --> 01:10:29,125
Speaker 7:  Volkswagen,

1196
01:10:30,715 --> 01:10:33,885
Speaker 7:  like they have a big business in China, and the Chinese EV market is super

1197
01:10:33,885 --> 01:10:37,525
Speaker 7:  mature. And I think that has allowed them to build a car some lower costs.

1198
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:40,475
Speaker 7:  And I think there's a reason we're talking about this car coming to Europe

1199
01:10:40,475 --> 01:10:44,445
Speaker 7:  and not to the United States right now. So like a lot of the investment has

1200
01:10:44,445 --> 01:10:48,005
Speaker 7:  been paid for, which is really what, why so many first generation EVs are

1201
01:10:48,005 --> 01:10:51,165
Speaker 7:  so expensive, right? You're, you're paying off a huge initial investment.

1202
01:10:51,465 --> 01:10:54,005
Speaker 7:  But If you Volkswagen, you know, you paid a bunch of money for your Rivian

1203
01:10:54,005 --> 01:10:57,245
Speaker 7:  investment, they're like, here it is. Like here's our CD rom make the car

1204
01:10:57,245 --> 01:11:01,165
Speaker 7:  good. And then there's huge investments across the entire Chinese

1205
01:11:01,165 --> 01:11:04,725
Speaker 7:  ecosystem. Actually, one of the, we should do a story on this somehow. I

1206
01:11:04,725 --> 01:11:07,965
Speaker 7:  will assign a story on this off this forecast. One of the most fascinating

1207
01:11:07,965 --> 01:11:10,605
Speaker 7:  things that is happening right now is that car YouTubers are discovering

1208
01:11:10,605 --> 01:11:12,005
Speaker 7:  that Chinese EVs are sick.

1209
01:11:12,315 --> 01:11:14,965
Speaker 8:  I've been noticing this. There's, there's like a run of these videos

1210
01:11:15,305 --> 01:11:18,445
Speaker 7:  Is like one of the best tiktoks around like one of my favorite TikTok channels.

1211
01:11:19,785 --> 01:11:23,765
Speaker 7:  He just did a bunch on Chinese cars. Like he opens one, I think it's

1212
01:11:23,765 --> 01:11:26,885
Speaker 7:  the L one. And he is like, if this car was in America, Tesla would be cooked.

1213
01:11:26,885 --> 01:11:30,005
Speaker 7:  Like that's the opening to the video. Wow. And then you, he goes through

1214
01:11:30,005 --> 01:11:33,845
Speaker 7:  it and the car is sick and it's $53,000 and like

1215
01:11:33,845 --> 01:11:37,445
Speaker 7:  yes. Is there a massive Chinese government subsidy

1216
01:11:37,825 --> 01:11:41,365
Speaker 7:  to develop those cars, produce those cars to do the ev Yes, there is the

1217
01:11:41,605 --> 01:11:44,565
Speaker 7:  economic system that develop that car is vastly different than the economic

1218
01:11:44,565 --> 01:11:48,005
Speaker 7:  system in the United States. But the car's done right, like it exists and

1219
01:11:48,005 --> 01:11:51,365
Speaker 7:  that the market is huge and Chinese automakers are,

1220
01:11:51,715 --> 01:11:54,885
Speaker 7:  they're, they're, they're like branching down a different evolutionary path.

1221
01:11:54,985 --> 01:11:57,725
Speaker 7:  Now, like here in the United States, we have a lot of hybrids. Like I have

1222
01:11:57,725 --> 01:12:01,595
Speaker 7:  a very cranky Jeep hybrid in China. They're all doing range

1223
01:12:01,595 --> 01:12:04,555
Speaker 7:  extenders. So they have gas engines that run at fixed RPMs that just charge

1224
01:12:04,555 --> 01:12:08,515
Speaker 7:  the batteries. We need more range. Mm. Which is like, that's how like diesel

1225
01:12:08,995 --> 01:12:11,915
Speaker 7:  electric locomotive works, right? Like they're just like headed off down

1226
01:12:11,915 --> 01:12:15,275
Speaker 7:  different roads. 'cause the core ev power train is like done.

1227
01:12:16,215 --> 01:12:19,395
Speaker 7:  And like we we're not, we're nowhere close. We have Tesla. And it's like,

1228
01:12:19,395 --> 01:12:22,155
Speaker 7:  well someone will throw an egg at your car. Like it's not a choice.

1229
01:12:23,375 --> 01:12:25,995
Speaker 7:  But I think it's like one of the most interesting stories is,

1230
01:12:27,875 --> 01:12:31,755
Speaker 7:  you know, like for a car and driver to do a big package

1231
01:12:31,895 --> 01:12:34,605
Speaker 7:  on Chinese cars, you know, they,

1232
01:12:35,905 --> 01:12:38,685
Speaker 7:  it would just be different. Like a traditional magazine like that just has

1233
01:12:38,685 --> 01:12:42,005
Speaker 7:  to like attack that problem differently. Car YouTubers just need content,

1234
01:12:42,455 --> 01:12:45,485
Speaker 7:  right? And they're kind of like out, like, here it is. Like

1235
01:12:46,425 --> 01:12:49,205
Speaker 7:  here's a, here's another weird Cadillac, it's

1236
01:12:49,735 --> 01:12:53,325
Speaker 7:  50,000 pounds. Like whatever. They're like, look at these other cars. Look

1237
01:12:53,325 --> 01:12:57,285
Speaker 7:  at, look at, these are weird. And there's an entire universe of cars that

1238
01:12:57,285 --> 01:13:00,805
Speaker 7:  are weird, like have like buttons that American cars don't have in them also.

1239
01:13:00,805 --> 01:13:02,445
Speaker 7:  And they're kinda like drawn to them. The, the

1240
01:13:02,445 --> 01:13:05,525
Speaker 8:  Chinese companies have done a good job of making cars that look like the

1241
01:13:05,525 --> 01:13:09,205
Speaker 8:  future in a cool way and not, like you said Tylenol

1242
01:13:09,205 --> 01:13:11,765
Speaker 8:  capsules. Like Yeah. Some lessons to be learned

1243
01:13:11,765 --> 01:13:15,125
Speaker 7:  From that. Look, I, I don't know, the economics of social platforms are weird.

1244
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:17,325
Speaker 7:  The economics of the creator economy are weird. I don't know if the Chinese

1245
01:13:17,345 --> 01:13:20,045
Speaker 7:  car companies are paying all the car YouTubers suit. Like, I don't know.

1246
01:13:20,155 --> 01:13:23,965
Speaker 7:  Like I, I don't know what junkets they're taking. I just know that you

1247
01:13:23,965 --> 01:13:27,365
Speaker 7:  watch the reaction to these videos and it is astounding,

1248
01:13:27,865 --> 01:13:31,415
Speaker 7:  right? Like the, the one I'm describing from Fort went viral. Like Kara Swisher

1249
01:13:31,415 --> 01:13:34,215
Speaker 7:  shared a car video. Like what are we doing here? Like, is this weird? My,

1250
01:13:34,435 --> 01:13:37,815
Speaker 7:  my cousin and my uncle sent it to me like it went viral in a different way.

1251
01:13:38,145 --> 01:13:41,855
Speaker 7:  Right? Because the car inside of that video is compelling. And his point

1252
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:45,855
Speaker 7:  is, we can't have this car. Like we don't have access to Chinese

1253
01:13:46,045 --> 01:13:49,895
Speaker 7:  cars this way and everyone because of tariffs, 'cause all this stuff.

1254
01:13:50,045 --> 01:13:53,975
Speaker 7:  They're like, oh, American manufacturers can't compete. That's not

1255
01:13:53,975 --> 01:13:56,895
Speaker 7:  what you want to, that's not what you want the comment section to be filled

1256
01:13:56,895 --> 01:13:59,735
Speaker 7:  with. Right? Like, you want the comment section to be filled with

1257
01:14:00,975 --> 01:14:04,775
Speaker 7:  like, fuck you GM forever or whatever. Like just, it was just not

1258
01:14:04,775 --> 01:14:07,815
Speaker 7:  present there. Right. And the part where it's like what you normally see

1259
01:14:07,815 --> 01:14:11,365
Speaker 7:  in an ev comment section, it's like, I, I'll never buy an ev The range extender

1260
01:14:11,365 --> 01:14:15,065
Speaker 7:  solved that problem. Kids are like, oh, you can just fill this thing. You

1261
01:14:15,065 --> 01:14:18,065
Speaker 7:  like gas, just put gas in this part of the car, it'll be fine.

1262
01:14:19,075 --> 01:14:22,865
Speaker 7:  We're far away from the Volkswagen. We, we started now,

1263
01:14:22,885 --> 01:14:26,185
Speaker 7:  now I'm just ranting about tariffs. A preview of what's to come my friend.

1264
01:14:26,485 --> 01:14:30,425
Speaker 7:  All right. Last item in the lightning round. And then I, I promise you, 90

1265
01:14:30,425 --> 01:14:34,185
Speaker 7:  more minutes of iPad Air conversation Microsoft shut down Skype.

1266
01:14:34,445 --> 01:14:34,905
Speaker 7:  I'm sad.

1267
01:14:36,015 --> 01:14:37,185
Speaker 8:  Jake, are you surprised by this?

1268
01:14:39,285 --> 01:14:43,145
Speaker 9:  No, no. I mean, I, I, I would love to know in the last time people used

1269
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:46,385
Speaker 9:  Skype was I, I was looking back at some of the

1270
01:14:46,545 --> 01:14:50,305
Speaker 9:  retrospectives. There were like five Skype redesigns I didn't even know

1271
01:14:50,665 --> 01:14:54,505
Speaker 9:  happened there. There was one that was like so experimental. It like didn't

1272
01:14:54,505 --> 01:14:58,265
Speaker 9:  even have an interface. Like I, it was like some weird like

1273
01:14:58,405 --> 01:15:02,385
Speaker 9:  neo Snapchat thing. It was cra nobody even knew this happened

1274
01:15:02,545 --> 01:15:05,745
Speaker 9:  'cause nobody was opening up Skype. And you know, it's really sad. Skype

1275
01:15:05,745 --> 01:15:05,945
Speaker 9:  was,

1276
01:15:08,245 --> 01:15:11,545
Speaker 9:  you know, a very foundational pioneer in,

1277
01:15:12,325 --> 01:15:14,825
Speaker 9:  you know, voice calling in the VoIP space.

1278
01:15:16,745 --> 01:15:20,305
Speaker 9:  I, I remember like using it very early on and you would pay like, you know,

1279
01:15:20,555 --> 01:15:24,345
Speaker 9:  cents and be able to make a phone call Ooh, like crazy from

1280
01:15:24,345 --> 01:15:27,905
Speaker 9:  your computer to a real phone. And it felt incredible.

1281
01:15:28,125 --> 01:15:31,265
Speaker 9:  It was like the coolest thing ever. People used to call real phones back

1282
01:15:31,265 --> 01:15:34,465
Speaker 9:  then. This was, don't worry about that. Yeah, it's not important. You know,

1283
01:15:34,465 --> 01:15:38,225
Speaker 9:  Skype, Skype was, was kind of mind blowing and it really had this incredible

1284
01:15:38,335 --> 01:15:41,985
Speaker 9:  life as, you know, a chat app too and a a,

1285
01:15:42,165 --> 01:15:45,665
Speaker 9:  you know, a voice calling app of its own.

1286
01:15:46,165 --> 01:15:49,345
Speaker 9:  And you know, Tom Warren has a piece up on our site right now looking back

1287
01:15:49,345 --> 01:15:50,425
Speaker 9:  at sort of what went wrong.

1288
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:55,195
Speaker 9:  It was sold to eBay for a while. eBay sold it to Microsoft. Microsoft paid

1289
01:15:55,195 --> 01:15:58,955
Speaker 9:  eight and a half billion, I think it was in 2011. And that was

1290
01:15:58,955 --> 01:16:02,915
Speaker 9:  right around the time things started going wrong. Which is not to say

1291
01:16:03,155 --> 01:16:06,195
Speaker 9:  it was Microsoft's fault so much as mobile was

1292
01:16:06,545 --> 01:16:10,075
Speaker 9:  exploding and Skype was a desktop service. And

1293
01:16:10,945 --> 01:16:14,435
Speaker 9:  this sort of ultimately, and I'm just stealing Tom's remarks here,

1294
01:16:15,735 --> 01:16:18,755
Speaker 9:  led to this situation where, okay, the pandemic comes around and everybody

1295
01:16:18,755 --> 01:16:22,435
Speaker 9:  needs to do voice calling and video chatting and nobody

1296
01:16:22,465 --> 01:16:25,155
Speaker 9:  went to Skype and everybody went to enterprise software

1297
01:16:26,345 --> 01:16:28,675
Speaker 9:  because it just, like, it never quite made that leap.

1298
01:16:29,145 --> 01:16:32,795
Speaker 8:  Okay. So I think, I think the, all the facts you just said are correct and

1299
01:16:32,795 --> 01:16:36,515
Speaker 8:  I think the story you just told is dead wrong. Hmm. I I, I

1300
01:16:36,875 --> 01:16:38,995
Speaker 8:  honestly believe I've spent a lot of time the last few days thinking about

1301
01:16:38,995 --> 01:16:42,315
Speaker 8:  this. I think Skype might be one of the most

1302
01:16:43,185 --> 01:16:46,955
Speaker 8:  bottled botched acquisitions in the history of the tech

1303
01:16:47,195 --> 01:16:51,035
Speaker 8:  industry. Like, I, I think you could make a case right now that Skype is

1304
01:16:51,035 --> 01:16:54,515
Speaker 8:  still the best loved brand name in its space.

1305
01:16:54,905 --> 01:16:58,235
Speaker 8:  Like, people I think still have better feelings about Skype right now

1306
01:16:59,065 --> 01:17:01,195
Speaker 8:  than they do about just about anything else in space. 'cause they

1307
01:17:01,195 --> 01:17:01,675
Speaker 7:  Stopped using it.

1308
01:17:02,265 --> 01:17:02,955
Speaker 8:  Sure. But like,

1309
01:17:03,265 --> 01:17:06,715
Speaker 7:  Like looking back, I, I, I mean, yeah, like I, I stopped using my creative

1310
01:17:06,995 --> 01:17:08,795
Speaker 7:  Rio MP three player and now I love it. But

1311
01:17:09,505 --> 01:17:10,045
Speaker 8:  No you don't.

1312
01:17:11,085 --> 01:17:13,805
Speaker 7:  I I love the memories associated with it. But

1313
01:17:13,805 --> 01:17:17,405
Speaker 8:  That's the thing. Skype was a decade ahead of its

1314
01:17:17,405 --> 01:17:20,925
Speaker 8:  competition on almost everything and had a bunch of like complicated tech

1315
01:17:20,925 --> 01:17:22,685
Speaker 8:  debt and foundational stuff in, I'm

1316
01:17:22,685 --> 01:17:24,205
Speaker 7:  Sorry it was a Diamond Rio. I apologize.

1317
01:17:24,395 --> 01:17:28,205
Speaker 8:  Yeah, there you go. Go ahead. Which is, yeah, you're not, you're,

1318
01:17:28,205 --> 01:17:31,765
Speaker 8:  you're not not helping my point here. This is great for me. Okay. I think

1319
01:17:32,685 --> 01:17:36,525
Speaker 8:  Microsoft bought a thing that, to your point, Jake had some tech debt,

1320
01:17:36,625 --> 01:17:40,405
Speaker 8:  had some problems had, was, was behind. But also

1321
01:17:40,435 --> 01:17:43,885
Speaker 8:  like the mobile revolution was the VoIP revolution, right? Like

1322
01:17:44,185 --> 01:17:48,045
Speaker 8:  mobile made WhatsApp happen. There's nothing that WhatsApp has that

1323
01:17:48,045 --> 01:17:51,965
Speaker 8:  Skype didn't sit on for a long time. Skype had a bunch

1324
01:17:51,965 --> 01:17:55,565
Speaker 8:  of like technical problems. It did peer-to-peer stuff because of the way

1325
01:17:55,565 --> 01:17:57,885
Speaker 8:  that it was architected early on. And it would've had to, but

1326
01:17:58,085 --> 01:17:58,725
Speaker 7:  Microsoft done did that,

1327
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:00,125
Speaker 8:  Right? This is

1328
01:18:00,125 --> 01:18:00,445
Speaker 7:  The thing,

1329
01:18:00,445 --> 01:18:04,005
Speaker 8:  Right? It's all just, there's no reason this didn't work except that

1330
01:18:04,285 --> 01:18:07,965
Speaker 8:  Microsoft screwed it up. And Skype had a bunch of correct

1331
01:18:08,055 --> 01:18:11,765
Speaker 8:  ideas about not only what Zoom and

1332
01:18:11,815 --> 01:18:15,285
Speaker 8:  Teams and Meet would eventually do, but what, like the whole

1333
01:18:15,315 --> 01:18:19,125
Speaker 8:  messaging ecosystem was going to become that. It could have been

1334
01:18:19,125 --> 01:18:23,005
Speaker 8:  Skype, could have been Zoom and WhatsApp simultaneously.

1335
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:26,725
Speaker 8:  It was just sitting right there for it. And it just

1336
01:18:27,165 --> 01:18:30,965
Speaker 8:  absolutely threw it away because of, as far as I can understand,

1337
01:18:31,035 --> 01:18:34,965
Speaker 8:  just total corporate disasters. I am also determined to get to the bottom

1338
01:18:34,985 --> 01:18:38,405
Speaker 8:  of what actually happened here inside of Microsoft. If you know and wanna

1339
01:18:38,405 --> 01:18:42,365
Speaker 8:  talk to me about it, David, at The Verge dot com. I have, I have until

1340
01:18:42,385 --> 01:18:45,885
Speaker 8:  May 5th to actually figure out the answer to this story before no one will

1341
01:18:45,885 --> 01:18:48,805
Speaker 8:  ever care anymore. And I am desperate to figure out what actually happened

1342
01:18:48,805 --> 01:18:52,325
Speaker 8:  here because like, something stupid

1343
01:18:52,725 --> 01:18:55,445
Speaker 8:  happened inside of Microsoft that made all of this fall apart and I cannot

1344
01:18:55,445 --> 01:18:57,485
Speaker 8:  figure out what it's, and also just the fact

1345
01:18:57,665 --> 01:18:59,365
Speaker 7:  Satcha Nadella was like, we own Skype.

1346
01:19:00,365 --> 01:19:02,805
Speaker 8:  I honestly, that might've been part of it, right? There's like a big leadership

1347
01:19:02,805 --> 01:19:05,205
Speaker 8:  change and like, we're gonna do something else. But even at the beginning

1348
01:19:05,205 --> 01:19:09,045
Speaker 8:  of the pandemic, the fact that Microsoft decided to build a thing called

1349
01:19:09,215 --> 01:19:13,205
Speaker 8:  Teams and turn that into its product instead

1350
01:19:13,205 --> 01:19:14,405
Speaker 8:  of just doubling down on Skype.

1351
01:19:16,595 --> 01:19:16,945
Speaker 7:  Weird,

1352
01:19:17,765 --> 01:19:20,815
Speaker 8:  Like, you know, it's a crappy brand for talking to your friends teams.

1353
01:19:21,935 --> 01:19:25,695
Speaker 8:  I feel the same way about Google Meet. It's like I, I get on for like

1354
01:19:25,915 --> 01:19:28,695
Speaker 8:  my fantasy football draft and they're like, oh, should we jump on meet? And

1355
01:19:28,695 --> 01:19:32,655
Speaker 8:  I'm like, no, I don't wanna go to work. Like this sucks. We just ruined

1356
01:19:32,685 --> 01:19:36,535
Speaker 8:  this. And like, I don't know, Skype, Skype had all the ingredients of

1357
01:19:36,535 --> 01:19:40,415
Speaker 8:  being like an actually central thing to the internet for a

1358
01:19:40,415 --> 01:19:43,375
Speaker 8:  really long time. And Microsoft just let it die.

1359
01:19:43,685 --> 01:19:46,575
Speaker 7:  Yeah. This reminds me that in the middle of the pandemic, Verizon bought

1360
01:19:46,575 --> 01:19:49,015
Speaker 7:  BlueJeans and they tried to make everyone think blue jeans would be a thing

1361
01:19:49,015 --> 01:19:49,335
Speaker 8:  For so

1362
01:19:49,335 --> 01:19:53,095
Speaker 7:  Much money. For so much money. I, I think Skype had some

1363
01:19:53,095 --> 01:19:56,935
Speaker 7:  technical problems that made it easier to start with teams or

1364
01:19:56,935 --> 01:20:00,695
Speaker 7:  to start again with teams. And I'll never forget, you know, teams basically

1365
01:20:00,695 --> 01:20:03,895
Speaker 7:  killed Slack, right? They, the introduction of teams and the bundling of

1366
01:20:03,895 --> 01:20:07,095
Speaker 7:  teams in office is what drove Slack into the arms of Salesforce.

1367
01:20:08,545 --> 01:20:11,845
Speaker 7:  And I'll never forget someone at Microsoft was like, you have to understand,

1368
01:20:12,245 --> 01:20:15,365
Speaker 7:  everyone thinks we're making some like work chat product

1369
01:20:16,055 --> 01:20:19,765
Speaker 7:  teams is a video conferencing product. Like, that's what it is. And that's

1370
01:20:19,765 --> 01:20:22,725
Speaker 7:  why people are using it. That's why. And you're like, but that's Skype. You

1371
01:20:22,935 --> 01:20:23,965
Speaker 7:  Skype. You

1372
01:20:23,965 --> 01:20:25,125
Speaker 8:  Did that already. Yeah.

1373
01:20:26,135 --> 01:20:29,195
Speaker 7:  And they were just very convinced that fundamentally

1374
01:20:30,435 --> 01:20:34,245
Speaker 7:  they were, they were initiating people to use Microsoft video chatting services

1375
01:20:34,275 --> 01:20:37,805
Speaker 7:  with teams. 'cause people thought it was Slack and Slack was all rage,

1376
01:20:38,715 --> 01:20:42,015
Speaker 7:  but they were actually competing with Zoom the entire time. I don't know

1377
01:20:42,015 --> 01:20:45,695
Speaker 7:  man, I, I'm sad. I, we made a lot of podcasts on Skype over the years. I

1378
01:20:45,695 --> 01:20:48,695
Speaker 7:  still think, by the way, Skype has the best To this day, the best audio and

1379
01:20:48,695 --> 01:20:50,015
Speaker 7:  video quality of all the services.

1380
01:20:52,015 --> 01:20:55,475
Speaker 7:  But I haven't touched it in forever. Like yeah

1381
01:20:55,635 --> 01:20:57,315
Speaker 8:  'cause why, why would you? Yeah, there's nothing,

1382
01:20:58,835 --> 01:21:01,675
Speaker 7:  Whenever, whenever I appear on CNBC for cable news hits, I would always tell

1383
01:21:01,675 --> 01:21:04,395
Speaker 7:  them to use Skype. 'cause they supported Skype and their engineers would

1384
01:21:04,395 --> 01:21:04,835
Speaker 7:  be like, what?

1385
01:21:07,025 --> 01:21:09,395
Speaker 7:  Like, you don't wanna love that. You don't wanna be on Zoom? And I be, zoom

1386
01:21:09,395 --> 01:21:11,715
Speaker 7:  looks bad. And I'm like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And they would later they'd

1387
01:21:11,715 --> 01:21:13,755
Speaker 7:  all be like, you're right. We can't get anyone else to

1388
01:24:36,495 --> 01:24:38,255
Speaker 8:  circled on the tariff calendar. They were

1389
01:24:38,255 --> 01:24:40,975
Speaker 7:  Already, by the way, delayed for a month. I just wanna make that out, right?

1390
01:24:41,155 --> 01:24:42,455
Speaker 7:  TikTok is illegal.

1391
01:24:42,915 --> 01:24:43,135
Speaker 8:  Oh

1392
01:24:43,135 --> 01:24:44,975
Speaker 7:  Yeah. That deadline is coming up in one month.

1393
01:24:45,035 --> 01:24:47,975
Speaker 8:  That's also gonna be that week. Oh man, the first week of April's gonna suck.

1394
01:24:49,895 --> 01:24:52,455
Speaker 7:  Rubber's hitting the road for the Trump administration, right? Yeah. Like

1395
01:24:52,915 --> 01:24:54,415
Speaker 7:  you, they have all these ideas. They

1396
01:24:54,415 --> 01:24:55,735
Speaker 9:  Can't possibly delay these. Again,

1397
01:24:57,525 --> 01:25:01,095
Speaker 7:  Laws are just a concept. Concepts of a law.

1398
01:25:01,515 --> 01:25:05,365
Speaker 7:  The tariff lawsuits have to be coming. So tariffs are a big deal.

1399
01:25:05,365 --> 01:25:07,245
Speaker 7:  You know, you might be wondering why is the first guy sign my terrorist,

1400
01:25:08,145 --> 01:25:11,365
Speaker 7:  the CEO of Best Buy is like the prices are gonna go up and everything we

1401
01:25:11,365 --> 01:25:15,085
Speaker 7:  sell because everything is manufactured abroad or you know, the

1402
01:25:15,575 --> 01:25:18,725
Speaker 7:  Apple loves to say this is what the iPhone, like the Corning makes the glass

1403
01:25:18,725 --> 01:25:21,805
Speaker 7:  in America and they ship it over here and the chips are made over here. And

1404
01:25:21,805 --> 01:25:24,925
Speaker 7:  that, that all comes to China to, for final assembly and it's shipped back

1405
01:25:24,925 --> 01:25:28,885
Speaker 7:  to America. And by the way, we're hiring 500 billion people in Houston to

1406
01:25:28,885 --> 01:25:31,365
Speaker 7:  build Apple intelligence servers because everyone loves Apple intelligence.

1407
01:25:31,365 --> 01:25:33,445
Speaker 7:  And you're like, oh, they're trying to point out that their supply chain

1408
01:25:33,445 --> 01:25:33,805
Speaker 7:  is global.

1409
01:25:35,515 --> 01:25:39,335
Speaker 7:  And so every product we cover has is just

1410
01:25:39,335 --> 01:25:42,815
Speaker 7:  deeply and meaningfully implicated by tariffs to the point where we've been

1411
01:25:42,815 --> 01:25:46,805
Speaker 7:  asking these companies now for over a month, like, what are you gonna do?

1412
01:25:47,265 --> 01:25:50,845
Speaker 7:  And they're starting. I think the chaos is starting to, I think for it

1413
01:25:50,845 --> 01:25:54,245
Speaker 7:  initially they didn't wanna say anything like, Jake, I mean you've even running

1414
01:25:54,265 --> 01:25:57,005
Speaker 7:  the story basically initially they were just like, no, nothing. Like,

1415
01:25:57,035 --> 01:26:00,605
Speaker 9:  Yeah, just nobody would respond to us at all. And, and we, we just kept sending

1416
01:26:00,605 --> 01:26:04,445
Speaker 9:  emails and then yeah, finally people have been

1417
01:26:04,605 --> 01:26:08,485
Speaker 9:  starting to just be like, well, yeah, the prices are going up. My favorite,

1418
01:26:08,485 --> 01:26:11,325
Speaker 9:  and we talked about this a couple weeks ago, but like a a, I think it was

1419
01:26:11,345 --> 01:26:15,205
Speaker 9:  Acer's, CEO was just like, well, yeah, it's, there's like a 10% tariff. The

1420
01:26:15,205 --> 01:26:19,085
Speaker 9:  price will go up 10%. Like, there's just, just math and it's, yeah.

1421
01:26:19,235 --> 01:26:22,965
Speaker 9:  It's, it's sort of unavoidable. If they actually do, if, if

1422
01:26:22,995 --> 01:26:26,565
Speaker 9:  they go into effect, which I think like the big question is knowing whether

1423
01:26:26,585 --> 01:26:28,685
Speaker 9:  or not they're in effect at any given time. Right?

1424
01:26:29,005 --> 01:26:32,925
Speaker 8:  I think what's been really interesting the last few days even has been that

1425
01:26:33,325 --> 01:26:37,025
Speaker 8:  I think this time those folks thought it was real.

1426
01:26:37,685 --> 01:26:41,345
Speaker 8:  And so, 'cause like if, If you rewind to like the campaign,

1427
01:26:42,685 --> 01:26:46,185
Speaker 8:  nobody believed Trump about tariffs, right? Like, this is the thing

1428
01:26:46,525 --> 01:26:49,425
Speaker 8:  all the banks have been saying since is like, oh, we didn't think he'd actually

1429
01:26:49,425 --> 01:26:52,665
Speaker 8:  do it. And then he was like, oh, I'm actually gonna do it. And everybody's

1430
01:26:52,665 --> 01:26:56,305
Speaker 8:  like, well, we'll see what happens. And then it, it, then it got

1431
01:26:56,325 --> 01:26:59,785
Speaker 8:  paused and it was like, ha ha, we told you this is never gonna happen. It's

1432
01:26:59,785 --> 01:27:03,065
Speaker 8:  gonna be fine. And 'cause everybody was like, well why isn't the stock market

1433
01:27:03,095 --> 01:27:06,905
Speaker 8:  tanking? Tariffs are gonna be a disaster. And then it

1434
01:27:06,905 --> 01:27:10,105
Speaker 8:  didn't because nobody thought it was gonna happen. But then this time it

1435
01:27:10,105 --> 01:27:13,065
Speaker 8:  started, it, it felt real enough to people that A, they started talking to

1436
01:27:13,065 --> 01:27:16,865
Speaker 8:  us and b things started to change like the, the best by

1437
01:27:16,945 --> 01:27:20,025
Speaker 8:  CEO. One of the most interesting things I thought he said was not just our

1438
01:27:20,025 --> 01:27:22,545
Speaker 8:  prices are gonna go up, he said they're gonna go up in the next couple of

1439
01:27:22,545 --> 01:27:26,265
Speaker 8:  days. Like they were, they were, they were ready for it. Like they were going

1440
01:27:26,265 --> 01:27:30,185
Speaker 8:  to start making these changes quickly because this stuff happens quickly.

1441
01:27:30,845 --> 01:27:33,865
Speaker 8:  And I then you get this pause again

1442
01:27:35,215 --> 01:27:38,925
Speaker 8:  based on as far as I can tell, nothing. Like it's, it's just the same.

1443
01:27:39,065 --> 01:27:42,405
Speaker 8:  We had a perfect phone call and now I'm pausing tariffs for a month thing

1444
01:27:42,405 --> 01:27:43,565
Speaker 8:  every time. And

1445
01:27:45,185 --> 01:27:48,965
Speaker 8:  it, it's just, now I wonder what all of these companies and people

1446
01:27:48,965 --> 01:27:52,845
Speaker 8:  think again is like, okay, is this now just what we're gonna do? This,

1447
01:27:52,845 --> 01:27:56,045
Speaker 8:  this threat is gonna loom for four years but never actually become real in

1448
01:27:56,045 --> 01:27:59,685
Speaker 8:  a meaningful way? Or does it get more real and more scary

1449
01:27:59,795 --> 01:28:03,765
Speaker 8:  each time and they are continuing to like batten

1450
01:28:03,765 --> 01:28:05,965
Speaker 8:  down the hatches even more. Right?

1451
01:28:05,965 --> 01:28:09,805
Speaker 7:  And then there's other ancillary components of this, like the di minimis

1452
01:28:09,805 --> 01:28:13,165
Speaker 7:  rule that allows Shein and Temu and a bunch of other companies

1453
01:28:13,785 --> 01:28:17,645
Speaker 7:  to ship packages from China under a certain dollar amount with no

1454
01:28:17,645 --> 01:28:21,565
Speaker 7:  customs or tariffs. And that already off the

1455
01:28:21,565 --> 01:28:25,325
Speaker 7:  books but delayed again because there was no infrastructure to actually check

1456
01:28:25,325 --> 01:28:28,165
Speaker 7:  those packages and make people pay for anything. Like

1457
01:28:30,415 --> 01:28:33,545
Speaker 7:  look, you can argue with the policy of any of this, right? Like sure,

1458
01:28:34,235 --> 01:28:37,185
Speaker 7:  maybe we shouldn't have a diminish rule. Maybe we shouldn't undercut American

1459
01:28:37,345 --> 01:28:41,225
Speaker 7:  retailers by allowing she to ex, I dunno, there's a lot you could say

1460
01:28:41,225 --> 01:28:45,105
Speaker 7:  about that. You need an infrastructure, you need to execute, right? Like

1461
01:28:45,475 --> 01:28:48,145
Speaker 7:  plans are great, it's all in the execution and they are not ready to execute

1462
01:28:48,145 --> 01:28:52,015
Speaker 7:  any of this over and over again. We see that. And then, you know, the

1463
01:28:52,015 --> 01:28:55,335
Speaker 7:  various leaders of Canada and and Mexico are like, we made a graph

1464
01:28:55,925 --> 01:28:59,615
Speaker 7:  that says criminals down and Trump is like, pause for a month and like I

1465
01:28:59,615 --> 01:29:03,565
Speaker 7:  just don't, what are we doing? Yeah. Car prices

1466
01:29:03,625 --> 01:29:06,365
Speaker 7:  are supposed to go up by as much as $12,000. I have no idea what's gonna

1467
01:29:06,365 --> 01:29:10,205
Speaker 7:  happen to the EV market. That thing about the Chinese EVs, that's a tariff

1468
01:29:10,205 --> 01:29:12,885
Speaker 7:  story, right? Yep. They, they don't, they don't exist here. 'cause like we've

1469
01:29:12,885 --> 01:29:15,645
Speaker 7:  just made it impossible to trade in those vehicles here you start taring

1470
01:29:15,645 --> 01:29:19,455
Speaker 7:  regular cars at these rates. Like maybe you

1471
01:29:19,575 --> 01:29:22,095
Speaker 7:  actually do end up with a bunch of Chinese car makers being like, yeah, we

1472
01:29:22,095 --> 01:29:24,135
Speaker 7:  can compete now. Yeah, by accident.

1473
01:29:24,225 --> 01:29:27,415
Speaker 8:  Cheap Chinese cars plus tariffs end up being cheaper than

1474
01:29:27,725 --> 01:29:31,335
Speaker 8:  expensive Canadian cars plus tariffs. It's like, I had not realized until

1475
01:29:31,335 --> 01:29:34,255
Speaker 8:  I read a story Andy Hawkins wrote about this, that cars are already at record

1476
01:29:34,255 --> 01:29:38,015
Speaker 8:  high prices. Like however this shakes out

1477
01:29:38,095 --> 01:29:41,695
Speaker 8:  on, on this front. It seems like we might be due for some weird upheaval

1478
01:29:41,695 --> 01:29:42,575
Speaker 8:  in the car market here.

1479
01:29:42,725 --> 01:29:46,535
Speaker 7:  Look, if not for the other baggage, the only car anyone should buy is a

1480
01:29:46,535 --> 01:29:50,055
Speaker 7:  2-year-old model three, like the most appreciated,

1481
01:29:50,175 --> 01:29:52,375
Speaker 7:  cheapest car in the world that like won't break down. 'cause

1482
01:29:52,465 --> 01:29:56,415
Speaker 8:  There is a, there is a sign in my neighbor's yard, two doors

1483
01:29:56,415 --> 01:29:59,855
Speaker 8:  down that just says sell your Tesla. Yeah. And I'm starting to see those

1484
01:29:59,855 --> 01:30:01,055
Speaker 8:  pop up all over my neighborhood. They're

1485
01:30:01,055 --> 01:30:01,415
Speaker 7:  All, they're all

1486
01:30:01,415 --> 01:30:04,135
Speaker 8:  Over the place. And the bumper stickers that say, I bought this before Elon

1487
01:30:04,135 --> 01:30:07,735
Speaker 8:  was crazy. Like, it's a real, it's a really fascinating thing happening in

1488
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:08,775
Speaker 8:  the Tesla universe right now.

1489
01:30:09,675 --> 01:30:13,255
Speaker 7:  If you, there's the great 4 0 4 media story this week about the cyber truck

1490
01:30:13,255 --> 01:30:17,135
Speaker 7:  owners club forum, just like breaking down over

1491
01:30:17,135 --> 01:30:19,535
Speaker 7:  how many, how many pe, how much people hate their cyber trucks

1492
01:30:21,085 --> 01:30:24,295
Speaker 7:  because you don't get to put the, I bought this before he was crazy on a

1493
01:30:24,295 --> 01:30:26,535
Speaker 7:  cyber truck, right? You're like, no, he was

1494
01:30:28,345 --> 01:30:30,575
Speaker 7:  right. He was doing a lot of this stuff. Like

1495
01:30:32,695 --> 01:30:34,535
Speaker 7:  speaking of Trump and Musk,

1496
01:30:36,165 --> 01:30:38,535
Speaker 7:  some, just some weirdness around Doge

1497
01:30:40,065 --> 01:30:43,725
Speaker 7:  the reality of what Doge is and the lawsuits are all kind of

1498
01:30:43,725 --> 01:30:47,405
Speaker 7:  colliding. So I think last time we talked about this, they officially

1499
01:30:47,405 --> 01:30:51,365
Speaker 7:  named an administrator of Doge, this woman named Amy Gleason. No one has

1500
01:30:51,365 --> 01:30:51,845
Speaker 7:  ever heard from

1501
01:30:52,785 --> 01:30:55,725
Speaker 8:  Who was, I think wasn't the story that she was on vacation in Mexico when

1502
01:30:55,725 --> 01:30:56,405
Speaker 7:  She was on vacation when she was

1503
01:30:56,405 --> 01:30:57,405
Speaker 8:  Named, yeah. When she was named. Yeah.

1504
01:30:57,405 --> 01:31:00,805
Speaker 7:  Good stuff. And then Trump gave the State of the Union and he pointed at

1505
01:31:00,915 --> 01:31:04,765
Speaker 7:  Elon who didn't know what to do with his hands. Like he didn't do a

1506
01:31:04,765 --> 01:31:08,405
Speaker 7:  Nazi salute, so that's a win, you know, low bar. We hit it. He

1507
01:31:08,405 --> 01:31:10,565
Speaker 8:  Just sort of was weird with a water bottle for a while. He was just

1508
01:31:10,725 --> 01:31:11,405
Speaker 7:  Like, what should I do it?

1509
01:31:13,255 --> 01:31:17,245
Speaker 7:  Sweet, weird dude. And he said, Elon is in

1510
01:31:17,245 --> 01:31:21,045
Speaker 7:  charge of Doge, Elon is the head of Doge, it's being run by Elon. The

1511
01:31:21,785 --> 01:31:25,565
Speaker 7:  amount of seconds between that statement and it appearing in court

1512
01:31:25,565 --> 01:31:28,725
Speaker 7:  filings about Doge being illegal, zero seconds,

1513
01:31:30,755 --> 01:31:34,605
Speaker 7:  like literally in real time filings were updated and submissions

1514
01:31:34,605 --> 01:31:38,445
Speaker 7:  were made being like the government is lying to the court about who? The

1515
01:31:38,445 --> 01:31:42,245
Speaker 7:  administrator of Doja, it's Elon Musk. Look at t Trump telling Congress that

1516
01:31:42,245 --> 01:31:45,965
Speaker 7:  Elon Rons do. So then today Trump had a cabinet meeting

1517
01:31:46,755 --> 01:31:50,605
Speaker 7:  with Elon president reporting in Politico where he told the

1518
01:31:50,605 --> 01:31:53,765
Speaker 7:  cabinet that they were in charge of their agencies and Elon had no authority

1519
01:31:53,765 --> 01:31:57,515
Speaker 7:  to fire anyone. And it's like, guys, the judges

1520
01:31:57,655 --> 01:31:58,355
Speaker 7:  aren't stupid.

1521
01:31:59,195 --> 01:31:59,485
Speaker 8:  Yeah.

1522
01:32:00,895 --> 01:32:04,665
Speaker 7:  Like they, they are getting the letters. I don't know if people really

1523
01:32:04,985 --> 01:32:07,905
Speaker 7:  recognize this, the letters, the emails he's sending out being like, what'd

1524
01:32:07,905 --> 01:32:10,305
Speaker 7:  you do this week? They're hitting the judicial branch.

1525
01:32:11,515 --> 01:32:12,055
Speaker 8:  Oh sure.

1526
01:32:12,525 --> 01:32:15,575
Speaker 7:  Like federal judges are getting the, what did you do this week? Emails.

1527
01:32:17,785 --> 01:32:20,075
Speaker 7:  They're not dumb. Like,

1528
01:32:21,695 --> 01:32:24,755
Speaker 7:  so I dunno if this is gonna work, but I I, the, the sort of like

1529
01:32:25,965 --> 01:32:29,635
Speaker 7:  legal reality, well the lawsuits are starting to catch up is basically what

1530
01:32:29,635 --> 01:32:33,555
Speaker 7:  I'm saying. And now we're at the point where, you know, Musk had a meeting

1531
01:32:33,555 --> 01:32:37,155
Speaker 7:  with the, like, Republican senators we're like, let us pass some laws to

1532
01:32:37,155 --> 01:32:37,995
Speaker 7:  do this for real.

1533
01:32:39,745 --> 01:32:42,485
Speaker 7:  And Trump has to like do this charade where he is like, Elon doesn't have

1534
01:32:42,485 --> 01:32:45,925
Speaker 7:  a job and everyone knows that he's in charge of Doge. I I think, I think

1535
01:32:45,925 --> 01:32:49,285
Speaker 7:  some of these lawsuits are gonna break against Elon and Trump in a big way

1536
01:32:49,285 --> 01:32:49,525
Speaker 7:  soon.

1537
01:32:50,825 --> 01:32:53,725
Speaker 8:  It, it's, it sure seems like it. And I think the, the, the bet they've been

1538
01:32:53,725 --> 01:32:55,685
Speaker 8:  making all along is that they can just be

1539
01:32:56,745 --> 01:33:00,525
Speaker 8:  2, 3, 12 steps ahead and it won't matter right. That

1540
01:33:00,525 --> 01:33:03,645
Speaker 8:  that what they've done will be hard to undo and they'll be onto the next

1541
01:33:03,645 --> 01:33:04,685
Speaker 8:  thing anyway. And

1542
01:33:06,315 --> 01:33:10,045
Speaker 8:  that one kind of seems to still be working. Yeah.

1543
01:33:10,115 --> 01:33:13,525
Speaker 8:  Like if, if the, if the judicial system is gonna remain

1544
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:18,285
Speaker 8:  four crises behind Doge, doge is gonna keep getting what it wants

1545
01:33:18,865 --> 01:33:22,525
Speaker 8:  and that, that continues to be the playbook as far as I can tell. Yeah.

1546
01:33:23,465 --> 01:33:27,085
Speaker 7:  On that same playbook, you know, there's all this reporting about the FAA

1547
01:33:27,085 --> 01:33:31,005
Speaker 7:  being ordered to cancel this Verizon contract for connectivity and

1548
01:33:31,005 --> 01:33:34,365
Speaker 7:  work with Starlink instead because SpaceX is gonna fix everything. We just

1549
01:33:34,525 --> 01:33:37,565
Speaker 7:  did a long decoder with Andy Hawkins about what's going on with the FAA.

1550
01:33:37,945 --> 01:33:41,885
Speaker 7:  So SpaceX denied this study. They posted on x quote, recent

1551
01:33:41,885 --> 01:33:45,485
Speaker 7:  media reports about SpaceX and the F AA are false. SpaceX is working in

1552
01:33:45,485 --> 01:33:49,445
Speaker 7:  coordination with L three Harris Tech. That's the main contractor. That's

1553
01:33:49,445 --> 01:33:52,885
Speaker 7:  the one that Elon said was single digit months away from catastrophic failure.

1554
01:33:53,705 --> 01:33:57,685
Speaker 7:  And the FAA to test the use of Starlink is one piece of the infrastructure

1555
01:33:57,685 --> 01:34:00,965
Speaker 7:  upgrades so badly needed along with Fiber wireless and other technologies.

1556
01:34:01,565 --> 01:34:05,445
Speaker 7:  Starlink is a possible partial fix to an aging system. There is no

1557
01:34:05,445 --> 01:34:08,645
Speaker 7:  effort or intent for Starlink to take over any existing contract. That's

1558
01:34:08,645 --> 01:34:12,285
Speaker 7:  just fear uncertainty. They've signed a loan agreement with L three Harris,

1559
01:34:12,395 --> 01:34:16,205
Speaker 7:  they've provided Starlink. So basically they've gone all the way from

1560
01:34:16,295 --> 01:34:20,285
Speaker 7:  Trump saying, I've asked Elon to fix air traffic control after a plane crash.

1561
01:34:20,745 --> 01:34:24,445
Speaker 7:  And Elon be like, I'll do it. They're single digit months away from catastrophic

1562
01:34:24,445 --> 01:34:28,245
Speaker 7:  failure. Here's some Starlink to fix it. Verizon being like, that

1563
01:34:28,665 --> 01:34:29,185
Speaker 7:  was our job.

1564
01:34:29,535 --> 01:34:30,945
Speaker 8:  Yeah, we're already fixing it.

1565
01:34:31,205 --> 01:34:34,025
Speaker 7:  And now SpaceX being like, we didn't, we didn't do anything. We, we gave

1566
01:34:34,025 --> 01:34:35,785
Speaker 7:  them, we bought some starlings at Best Buy.

1567
01:34:37,685 --> 01:34:41,595
Speaker 7:  Deeply confusing stuff. Again, you need a plan. These are all

1568
01:34:41,595 --> 01:34:45,075
Speaker 7:  great ideas you need to execute. And they, they have not laid out how to

1569
01:34:45,075 --> 01:34:45,275
Speaker 7:  execute.

1570
01:34:45,855 --> 01:34:49,675
Speaker 9:  I'm clear. Is L three Harris's system actually like months away from

1571
01:34:49,715 --> 01:34:51,555
Speaker 9:  failure or is that just something that Elon is telling us?

1572
01:34:52,065 --> 01:34:55,995
Speaker 7:  Andy has been asking Pete Buttigieg this question because

1573
01:34:56,095 --> 01:34:58,805
Speaker 7:  if they're single digit months away from failure today,

1574
01:35:00,235 --> 01:35:04,045
Speaker 7:  that means they were only a little over a year away from failure

1575
01:35:04,525 --> 01:35:08,245
Speaker 7:  when he was the Secretary of Transportation. And he has not yet answered

1576
01:35:08,245 --> 01:35:11,685
Speaker 7:  our questions. But you would think we would know if the entire United States

1577
01:35:11,685 --> 01:35:14,845
Speaker 7:  air traffic control system was a year away from catastrophic failure,

1578
01:35:15,545 --> 01:35:16,925
Speaker 7:  you, you'd think we would know it.

1579
01:35:16,945 --> 01:35:20,525
Speaker 8:  It does seem worth saying that the only evidence we have in either direction

1580
01:35:20,785 --> 01:35:23,605
Speaker 8:  so far is wood. Elon Musk says, and

1581
01:35:24,995 --> 01:35:27,605
Speaker 8:  that should be taken with the requisite grains of salt.

1582
01:35:28,745 --> 01:35:32,655
Speaker 7:  I I honestly wonder why, why SpaceX put out this statement. I

1583
01:35:32,735 --> 01:35:35,495
Speaker 7:  I think maybe a lot of people assume that they were gonna fix air traffic

1584
01:35:35,495 --> 01:35:37,535
Speaker 7:  control and they don't want that responsibility.

1585
01:35:38,645 --> 01:35:40,615
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I don't think that's a super fun job.

1586
01:35:41,125 --> 01:35:41,415
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

1587
01:35:42,475 --> 01:35:45,575
Speaker 8:  SpaceX also has like quite a bit going on at this particular moment in time.

1588
01:35:45,845 --> 01:35:46,135
Speaker 8:  Yeah,

1589
01:35:47,205 --> 01:35:51,095
Speaker 7:  There's more here. Trump wants to screen everybody applying

1590
01:35:51,095 --> 01:35:53,495
Speaker 7:  for citizenship. He wants to screen all their social media.

1591
01:35:55,615 --> 01:35:59,405
Speaker 7:  Sure. I mean it just, it's more incursion into

1592
01:35:59,405 --> 01:36:02,885
Speaker 7:  speech. Like that just is a thing that Trump administration is very fond

1593
01:36:02,885 --> 01:36:06,285
Speaker 7:  of doing is like saying some speech is good and some speech is bad and then

1594
01:36:06,285 --> 01:36:10,125
Speaker 7:  saying they support free speech. And then the Senate has stripped

1595
01:36:10,125 --> 01:36:13,965
Speaker 7:  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It's enforcement powers over

1596
01:36:14,835 --> 01:36:18,725
Speaker 7:  what it's general enforcement powers that would've covered x turning

1597
01:36:18,725 --> 01:36:22,265
Speaker 7:  into a payment service, which well, you know,

1598
01:36:23,985 --> 01:36:27,025
Speaker 7:  a little light corruption is like, you know, it's the, the stuff that life

1599
01:36:27,125 --> 01:36:28,505
Speaker 7:  is made of, you know, a

1600
01:36:28,505 --> 01:36:32,305
Speaker 8:  Little light corruption. It's my favorite Broadway musical. That's

1601
01:36:32,305 --> 01:36:35,185
Speaker 7:  What keeps it exciting out here. These United States. Speaking of speech,

1602
01:36:35,295 --> 01:36:37,185
Speaker 7:  it's, I think it's time, David, is it on time? Oh

1603
01:36:37,185 --> 01:36:40,905
Speaker 8:  My God. America's favorite podcast within a podcast. Brendan

1604
01:36:40,935 --> 01:36:41,665
Speaker 8:  Carr is a dummy.

1605
01:36:41,985 --> 01:36:45,425
Speaker 7:  I will say, I got some notes last week saying it

1606
01:36:45,715 --> 01:36:49,625
Speaker 7:  we're minimizing Brendan Carr by calling him a dummy. 'cause he's not stupid,

1607
01:36:49,655 --> 01:36:53,425
Speaker 7:  he's evil. And my point was that he's too dumb

1608
01:36:53,645 --> 01:36:55,425
Speaker 7:  to make his evil seem fun.

1609
01:36:56,185 --> 01:36:59,785
Speaker 8:  I also think being a dummy and being stupid are not the same thing. Yeah,

1610
01:37:00,025 --> 01:37:03,185
Speaker 8:  I, I feel very strongly that Brendan Carr is not stupid, but I do feel very

1611
01:37:03,345 --> 01:37:04,305
Speaker 8:  strongly that he's a dummy.

1612
01:37:04,445 --> 01:37:08,385
Speaker 7:  Let me make a comparison for you, Ted Cruz. Very smart man.

1613
01:37:08,815 --> 01:37:12,665
Speaker 7:  Some very bad ideas. You listen to Ted Cruz talk, he's like, he

1614
01:37:12,665 --> 01:37:16,505
Speaker 7:  makes it sound compelling. Like no one likes type,

1615
01:37:16,505 --> 01:37:19,945
Speaker 7:  you know what I mean? Like, he, he's like, let me weave you a story about

1616
01:37:19,945 --> 01:37:22,025
Speaker 7:  Supreme Court precedent. And at the end of it, you're like, huh, that's right.

1617
01:37:22,285 --> 01:37:26,065
Speaker 7:  And then you're like, wait, I thought about it that all that was lies. You

1618
01:37:26,065 --> 01:37:28,625
Speaker 7:  know, Brendan can't do it.

1619
01:37:29,815 --> 01:37:33,425
Speaker 7:  Like he's not smart enough to do it. He just says whatever

1620
01:37:34,455 --> 01:37:38,225
Speaker 7:  nonsensical censorship idea that he has, and I'll give you this

1621
01:37:38,225 --> 01:37:41,865
Speaker 7:  example. He was on stage last week after we taped,

1622
01:37:42,105 --> 01:37:45,905
Speaker 7:  he was on stage with Ben Smith, who's the editor in chief of S four, an event.

1623
01:37:46,425 --> 01:37:49,705
Speaker 7:  I know Ben Ben's a smart journalist. In the middle of this interview, Ben

1624
01:37:49,705 --> 01:37:52,665
Speaker 7:  Smith looked at Brendan Carr and said, I think, I think I'm being trolled

1625
01:37:52,665 --> 01:37:56,025
Speaker 7:  here because Brendan talks in such stupid circles,

1626
01:37:57,075 --> 01:38:00,385
Speaker 7:  right? Like, no matter what the question is, his idea is that he's so smart

1627
01:38:00,895 --> 01:38:03,945
Speaker 7:  that he can just like weave his way through it. And Ben was like, you're

1628
01:38:03,945 --> 01:38:07,915
Speaker 7:  just trolling me because you're, nothing you say makes sense. Like all of

1629
01:38:07,915 --> 01:38:11,395
Speaker 7:  it is in inherently contradictory and kind of like, you're just

1630
01:38:11,395 --> 01:38:15,115
Speaker 7:  justifying government censorship. And specifically what

1631
01:38:15,215 --> 01:38:18,755
Speaker 7:  he was responding to was Ben was saying, it aren't, aren't you just

1632
01:38:18,755 --> 01:38:22,675
Speaker 7:  attacking these broadcast stations for speech you don't like by holding

1633
01:38:22,675 --> 01:38:26,515
Speaker 7:  back their licenses or threatening these investigations? And Brendan's response

1634
01:38:26,515 --> 01:38:30,075
Speaker 7:  to this, this is one of the most value free, like,

1635
01:38:31,235 --> 01:38:34,965
Speaker 7:  like principles free, just naked. Like I'm a corrupt

1636
01:38:34,965 --> 01:38:38,405
Speaker 7:  piece of shit comments you can make. He said the FCC is built on

1637
01:38:38,405 --> 01:38:42,285
Speaker 7:  precedent and, you know, legal principles. And If you look

1638
01:38:42,285 --> 01:38:45,405
Speaker 7:  at what the Democrats did, I now have the, you know, they did bad stuff too.

1639
01:38:45,505 --> 01:38:49,345
Speaker 7:  So now I have the precedent to do bad stuff. And you're like,

1640
01:38:49,365 --> 01:38:53,225
Speaker 7:  no, you should not do bad stuff, right? If, if

1641
01:38:53,225 --> 01:38:57,025
Speaker 7:  your big worry is that under the Biden administration, the FCC

1642
01:38:57,085 --> 01:39:00,425
Speaker 7:  was doing all kinds of weird censorship, and you're a free speech warrior,

1643
01:39:00,885 --> 01:39:04,665
Speaker 7:  the answer is not for you to show up and do more censorship because they

1644
01:39:04,665 --> 01:39:08,595
Speaker 7:  set a bad precedent, right? Like, that makes you a

1645
01:39:08,595 --> 01:39:12,425
Speaker 7:  bad person, just straightforwardly If you're like, they

1646
01:39:12,435 --> 01:39:15,495
Speaker 7:  abuse the law. So now I am the Punisher.

1647
01:39:16,765 --> 01:39:20,625
Speaker 7:  You should not be in charge of speech in America. And that that is Brendan's

1648
01:39:20,625 --> 01:39:24,385
Speaker 7:  worldview. I promise you that is his worldview, is that he has been given

1649
01:39:24,505 --> 01:39:28,225
Speaker 7:  a permission slip to censor speech across the board

1650
01:39:28,455 --> 01:39:32,185
Speaker 7:  because the power he perceives to have, and when I say across the board,

1651
01:39:32,385 --> 01:39:33,665
Speaker 7:  I also mean across the ocean.

1652
01:39:35,415 --> 01:39:39,305
Speaker 7:  Because this week the, you know, his big thing this week, he, he said

1653
01:39:39,305 --> 01:39:43,225
Speaker 7:  the United States will defend the interest of our tech giants

1654
01:39:43,225 --> 01:39:46,955
Speaker 7:  against the uni, against the eus Digital Services Act. We've covered the

1655
01:39:46,955 --> 01:39:50,675
Speaker 7:  Digital Services Act a bunch on the show. I've made Jake write about it,

1656
01:39:50,675 --> 01:39:53,395
Speaker 7:  like every, like the entire VERGE team had to like write about the D S A

1657
01:39:53,595 --> 01:39:56,475
Speaker 7:  D S A is a big deal. It covers the big platforms. It says some platforms

1658
01:39:56,475 --> 01:39:59,515
Speaker 7:  are gatekeepers. There's Digital Markets Act, which right next to it. Then

1659
01:39:59,515 --> 01:40:01,995
Speaker 7:  the speech platforms have certain rules. What they can keep up and take down

1660
01:40:02,695 --> 01:40:04,995
Speaker 7:  the EU is like, we're, we're gonna have some laws around platforms. We have

1661
01:40:04,995 --> 01:40:08,955
Speaker 7:  a different, we don't, they don't have the First Amendment. They

1662
01:40:09,155 --> 01:40:12,985
Speaker 7:  have different speech laws in the eu, famously Elon Musk, I mean Mr.

1663
01:40:13,055 --> 01:40:16,145
Speaker 7:  Free speech absolutist lie, but he says it all the time. He is like, If you

1664
01:40:16,145 --> 01:40:19,505
Speaker 7:  don't like what's on our platform, pass a law and then we'll comply with

1665
01:40:19,505 --> 01:40:22,345
Speaker 7:  the law. Like, that's his vision. The EU passed some laws, they made some

1666
01:40:22,345 --> 01:40:26,055
Speaker 7:  laws, but JD Vance is like, your laws are incompatible to First Amendment.

1667
01:40:26,155 --> 01:40:29,895
Speaker 7:  And the EU is like, yeah, we don't, we don't have one of those. Like

1668
01:40:30,115 --> 01:40:32,895
Speaker 7:  we have, they have a different speech tradition. They're, I think they're

1669
01:40:32,895 --> 01:40:35,775
Speaker 7:  very proud of some of their free speech traditions. I get notes from our

1670
01:40:36,015 --> 01:40:37,735
Speaker 7:  European listeners all the time. They're like, we have free speech. This

1671
01:40:37,735 --> 01:40:41,695
Speaker 7:  is different than yours. And their criticism of our First Amendment is that

1672
01:40:41,695 --> 01:40:45,325
Speaker 7:  our First amendment is, is so absolute. Like we,

1673
01:40:46,065 --> 01:40:49,405
Speaker 7:  and I believe this, like I, I think this is a good thing, but the criticism

1674
01:40:49,425 --> 01:40:52,685
Speaker 7:  of it is it doesn't allow us to do common sense things

1675
01:40:54,015 --> 01:40:57,725
Speaker 7:  right there. We should not just allow hate speech the way that we allow it,

1676
01:40:57,725 --> 01:41:01,485
Speaker 7:  but our First Amendment jurisprudence allows it. We should

1677
01:41:01,635 --> 01:41:05,365
Speaker 7:  like deep fakes, we, we'll get to it, but like the EU can just like make

1678
01:41:05,365 --> 01:41:09,085
Speaker 7:  some speech laws in a way that I, I think is inappropriate. But they, their

1679
01:41:09,085 --> 01:41:13,045
Speaker 7:  criticism of our first amendment is you don't have to be this crazy about

1680
01:41:13,045 --> 01:41:15,485
Speaker 7:  it. Like you can just make some policies and see if they worked. And you

1681
01:41:15,485 --> 01:41:19,325
Speaker 7:  can change the policies. Brendan Carr is like, I will defend Facebook

1682
01:41:19,325 --> 01:41:22,405
Speaker 7:  against EU regulation. Dude, you run the FCC

1683
01:41:23,125 --> 01:41:26,935
Speaker 7:  like you are powerless against the European Union you have, there's

1684
01:41:26,935 --> 01:41:30,455
Speaker 7:  nothing for you to say that has anything to do with them. You can just

1685
01:41:30,585 --> 01:41:34,095
Speaker 7:  wield some enforcement authority corruptly, which you now said that you want

1686
01:41:34,095 --> 01:41:37,775
Speaker 7:  to do, and punish European companies that operate here or

1687
01:41:38,025 --> 01:41:42,015
Speaker 7:  issue statements of law that make no sense and basically just interfere with

1688
01:41:42,255 --> 01:41:46,115
Speaker 7:  business because you're on a power trip and everything

1689
01:41:46,115 --> 01:41:49,995
Speaker 7:  he does and says indicates that he's on a power trip. Even the

1690
01:41:49,995 --> 01:41:53,355
Speaker 7:  stuff that I think is intended to be like mysterious and fun is like, oh,

1691
01:41:53,355 --> 01:41:57,315
Speaker 7:  you're just on a power trip, for example, this is the last piece of

1692
01:41:57,315 --> 01:42:00,955
Speaker 7:  Brennan Carr. The SCC has these open meetings, right? And the open meetings

1693
01:42:00,955 --> 01:42:02,995
Speaker 7:  are supposed to be like, here's all the stuff on our agenda. They're usually

1694
01:42:02,995 --> 01:42:06,115
Speaker 7:  pretty unanimous. Like they don't argue at the open meetings. So they've

1695
01:42:06,115 --> 01:42:09,995
Speaker 7:  got one coming up and they're gonna explore at the march open meeting.

1696
01:42:09,995 --> 01:42:13,715
Speaker 7:  They're gonna explore alternatives to GPS to, you know, provide some redundancy

1697
01:42:13,715 --> 01:42:17,675
Speaker 7:  of system and also improvements to the 9 1 1 system. They're gonna next

1698
01:42:17,675 --> 01:42:21,275
Speaker 7:  generation 9 1 1. Great. This is like normal FCC stuff. Sure. This is what

1699
01:42:21,275 --> 01:42:25,075
Speaker 7:  you want the FCC doing. They're like, should 9 1 1 work better? Like Yeah,

1700
01:42:25,975 --> 01:42:27,395
Speaker 7:  you don't have to pay attention to this. I

1701
01:42:27,395 --> 01:42:30,115
Speaker 8:  Didn't know GPS was a problem, but we can come back to that some other time.

1702
01:42:30,265 --> 01:42:34,035
Speaker 7:  Well there's just like in a bipartisan way, you're like, we all depend on

1703
01:42:34,035 --> 01:42:36,635
Speaker 7:  this one system that could be disrupted. Sure. We should have, we should

1704
01:42:36,635 --> 01:42:37,115
Speaker 7:  have other,

1705
01:42:37,285 --> 01:42:39,355
Speaker 8:  Let's have more systems. Yeah. Right. Sure. I buy that.

1706
01:42:39,425 --> 01:42:42,995
Speaker 7:  This is some like basic stuff. Yeah. Final paragraph this. He says, wait,

1707
01:42:42,995 --> 01:42:46,915
Speaker 7:  there's more. Finally we'll consider an adjudicatory

1708
01:42:46,915 --> 01:42:50,875
Speaker 7:  item from the media bureau. I can't preview the details of an item like

1709
01:42:50,875 --> 01:42:54,155
Speaker 7:  this one in advance. I'm sure inquiring minds will wanna know, does it fit

1710
01:42:54,155 --> 01:42:57,435
Speaker 7:  with public safety? Our theme, unfortunately, the answer to that question

1711
01:42:57,455 --> 01:43:00,995
Speaker 7:  is no. But that's just how life and open meetings go. Sometimes this vote

1712
01:43:00,995 --> 01:43:04,235
Speaker 7:  will be part of our broader efforts to clean house and clear up some backlog.

1713
01:43:04,455 --> 01:43:07,755
Speaker 7:  So we'll be closing out with a good government win. What's an adjudicatory

1714
01:43:07,755 --> 01:43:08,835
Speaker 7:  item from the media bureau?

1715
01:43:09,305 --> 01:43:09,595
Speaker 8:  What

1716
01:43:10,865 --> 01:43:14,855
Speaker 7:  Right. He that, that means adjudicatory means he's gonna issue a judgment,

1717
01:43:14,855 --> 01:43:17,655
Speaker 7:  right? The media bureaus recovers all the broadcasters.

1718
01:43:19,375 --> 01:43:22,985
Speaker 7:  He's gonna do some goofy shit and he's like

1719
01:43:23,145 --> 01:43:24,225
Speaker 7:  hyping himself for it.

1720
01:43:24,275 --> 01:43:27,985
Speaker 8:  Could this be like the 60 miny kind of stuff that we've been talking about?

1721
01:43:28,055 --> 01:43:31,865
Speaker 8:  Like yet another, you were mean to Donald Trump on your news

1722
01:43:31,895 --> 01:43:32,865
Speaker 8:  show kind of things.

1723
01:43:33,665 --> 01:43:37,545
Speaker 7:  I I have no idea. I'm just saying like, he is drunk with power

1724
01:43:37,645 --> 01:43:41,425
Speaker 7:  and Yeah. And sitting in a chair that should not afford him any power whatsoever.

1725
01:43:42,285 --> 01:43:46,065
Speaker 8:  And he is having the time of his damn life. And we know that because he keeps

1726
01:43:46,065 --> 01:43:47,025
Speaker 8:  saying it out loud.

1727
01:43:47,495 --> 01:43:50,745
Speaker 7:  Yeah, he keeps, I mean, and I'm just saying we should not have government

1728
01:43:50,745 --> 01:43:54,645
Speaker 7:  sensors. I I know that's controversial here in America in 2025.

1729
01:43:55,745 --> 01:43:58,005
Speaker 7:  We should have government sensors. We should have government sensors who

1730
01:43:58,005 --> 01:44:01,885
Speaker 7:  think they can just make law any, any way they want, which is what Brendan

1731
01:44:01,945 --> 01:44:05,845
Speaker 7:  is doing. We should have government sensors who go to events and tell journalists

1732
01:44:05,845 --> 01:44:09,525
Speaker 7:  that they're empowered to be corrupt because they think their predecessors

1733
01:44:09,525 --> 01:44:13,465
Speaker 7:  were corrupt. That is exactly the opposite of how you clean up a

1734
01:44:13,465 --> 01:44:16,625
Speaker 7:  corrupt government. And you should not have government censors who think

1735
01:44:16,625 --> 01:44:20,465
Speaker 7:  that doing censorship is worth

1736
01:44:20,465 --> 01:44:23,745
Speaker 7:  like a hype reel in a press release. Like all this is wrong.

1737
01:44:24,215 --> 01:44:24,505
Speaker 7:  It's

1738
01:44:24,505 --> 01:44:28,305
Speaker 8:  Real like, bad guy with a gun, good guy with a gun energy.

1739
01:44:28,655 --> 01:44:32,585
Speaker 8:  Like the only way to stop the bad stuff is for me to do it. And

1740
01:44:32,585 --> 01:44:36,465
Speaker 8:  then it's not bad because I'm doing it. Yeah. It's like, it's kind of a,

1741
01:44:36,465 --> 01:44:39,745
Speaker 8:  like, I, there's like a, I'm a little tiny part of me that admires

1742
01:44:40,175 --> 01:44:43,945
Speaker 8:  that way of like thinking about your life, but it also just seems insane

1743
01:44:43,945 --> 01:44:44,225
Speaker 8:  to me.

1744
01:44:44,935 --> 01:44:47,825
Speaker 7:  When Trump was elected, our European reporters,

1745
01:44:48,565 --> 01:44:52,065
Speaker 7:  Thomas Ricker, tum War and all those folks, they were like, oh, we're in

1746
01:44:52,065 --> 01:44:55,905
Speaker 7:  for it. Because the EU is all about regulating the tech giants. And

1747
01:44:55,905 --> 01:44:59,865
Speaker 7:  there's a reason that all of the tech CEOs were the

1748
01:44:59,865 --> 01:45:03,785
Speaker 7:  inauguration. They want Trump to fight a war over the D s a in particular

1749
01:45:03,985 --> 01:45:07,305
Speaker 7:  d s a Digital Service act. And you can see that the war is starting.

1750
01:45:08,175 --> 01:45:10,985
Speaker 7:  It's not that Brendan Carr loves the tech giants, right? He wants to reopen

1751
01:45:11,175 --> 01:45:14,945
Speaker 7:  Section two 30 because he's just gonna write a law to reinterpret

1752
01:45:15,065 --> 01:45:17,665
Speaker 7:  a law that exists, not something an agency can do

1753
01:45:19,305 --> 01:45:22,755
Speaker 7:  very specifically, not something an agency can do anymore because it was

1754
01:45:22,755 --> 01:45:24,315
Speaker 7:  supreme recent Supreme Court ruling.

1755
01:45:26,165 --> 01:45:30,065
Speaker 7:  But it's like, you see that there's no logical coherency

1756
01:45:30,085 --> 01:45:33,985
Speaker 7:  to this man except the abuse of power. On

1757
01:45:33,985 --> 01:45:36,945
Speaker 7:  the one hand, he's gonna protect the check giants against Europe. On the

1758
01:45:36,945 --> 01:45:39,345
Speaker 7:  other hand, he's gonna beat them over the head with his interpretation of

1759
01:45:39,345 --> 01:45:42,785
Speaker 7:  two 30 so that they censor the way he wants them to. And it's like, just,

1760
01:45:43,955 --> 01:45:47,775
Speaker 7:  anyway, Brendan, as always, I know you listen, I know you get readouts. I,

1761
01:45:47,855 --> 01:45:51,575
Speaker 7:  I I, I honestly, I know you do. You're, you're welcome to come under

1762
01:45:51,625 --> 01:45:55,415
Speaker 7:  coder and face some real questions. I I'm gonna invite you every week I,

1763
01:45:55,555 --> 01:45:58,295
Speaker 7:  if people wanna tweet at Brendan, you can. He's, he's available. He loves

1764
01:45:58,295 --> 01:46:00,815
Speaker 7:  to tweet. He doesn't do anything except he know tweet at people and think

1765
01:46:00,815 --> 01:46:03,775
Speaker 7:  about how to abuse his power. So's up Brendan. He bren's and welcome on decoder.

1766
01:46:04,615 --> 01:46:08,265
Speaker 8:  What if, what if the adjudicatory item from the media bureau is Brendan Carr

1767
01:46:08,265 --> 01:46:09,065
Speaker 8:  coming on decoder?

1768
01:46:09,175 --> 01:46:12,585
Speaker 7:  That would be amazing. Brendan Carr is putting the eye Patel in jail.

1769
01:46:13,825 --> 01:46:16,835
Speaker 7:  I think he's a coward. I don't think he'll ever show up. So there's that.

1770
01:46:16,855 --> 01:46:18,075
Speaker 7:  But he's welcome. Anytime he wants,

1771
01:46:18,985 --> 01:46:20,045
Speaker 8:  We go. All

1772
01:46:20,045 --> 01:46:23,845
Speaker 7:  Right. We gotta wrap up with like a gadget just to clear the air. Jake, what

1773
01:46:23,845 --> 01:46:24,605
Speaker 7:  he got. Did

1774
01:46:24,605 --> 01:46:27,725
Speaker 9:  You see the phones that you can just attach an entire camera lens on the

1775
01:46:27,725 --> 01:46:28,005
Speaker 9:  back of

1776
01:46:28,805 --> 01:46:31,605
Speaker 7:  I did. And I got a note from Dieter being like, how do these, you think these

1777
01:46:31,675 --> 01:46:33,925
Speaker 7:  pogo pins work? Which is just very

1778
01:46:33,925 --> 01:46:34,605
Speaker 8:  Good. Wait

1779
01:46:34,605 --> 01:46:37,925
Speaker 9:  On, on this. They don't, they don't have to work. This is, I'm sure you should

1780
01:46:37,985 --> 01:46:41,325
Speaker 9:  ask Dom Mor because this is at MWC, so when you talk to 'em on Tuesday,

1781
01:46:41,825 --> 01:46:45,725
Speaker 9:  but it's, they're concepts, so I don't like do they work?

1782
01:46:45,795 --> 01:46:49,365
Speaker 9:  Like that's a very big question mark. Do they look insane and

1783
01:46:49,365 --> 01:46:52,325
Speaker 9:  ridiculous? Yeah. And do I like absolutely want this? A hundred percent.

1784
01:46:52,715 --> 01:46:56,205
Speaker 9:  It's just like, you know, and you could put a pancake, like pancake lenses

1785
01:46:56,215 --> 01:47:00,045
Speaker 9:  exist, right? There are small camera lenses. No, no, no, no. These are full

1786
01:47:00,045 --> 01:47:03,765
Speaker 9:  on telephoto lenses strapped to the back of, of what is essentially an

1787
01:47:03,765 --> 01:47:05,245
Speaker 9:  iPhone. So they just like

1788
01:47:05,315 --> 01:47:08,525
Speaker 8:  Made a phone with a mount on it and you can,

1789
01:47:09,305 --> 01:47:10,125
Speaker 9:  It rules, there's just,

1790
01:47:10,275 --> 01:47:11,365
Speaker 7:  It's an m mount, a full

1791
01:47:11,825 --> 01:47:15,725
Speaker 9:  Sensor just in the center, like open and exposed on the back

1792
01:47:15,725 --> 01:47:16,965
Speaker 9:  of this camera. It

1793
01:47:16,965 --> 01:47:20,405
Speaker 8:  Rules. It's great. Do you have to put a body cap on your phone when you're

1794
01:47:20,405 --> 01:47:20,885
Speaker 8:  not using it?

1795
01:47:22,635 --> 01:47:24,685
Speaker 9:  Yeah, it's not a bad idea. I mean,

1796
01:47:27,245 --> 01:47:29,725
Speaker 8:  I love, I I unironically love that idea.

1797
01:47:30,115 --> 01:47:30,725
Speaker 9:  This is great.

1798
01:47:30,955 --> 01:47:34,685
Speaker 8:  It's fabulous. Like we're, we're doing weird camera bump

1799
01:47:34,685 --> 01:47:37,765
Speaker 8:  things all over the place anyway. Like, just go after it.

1800
01:47:38,115 --> 01:47:41,965
Speaker 9:  Yeah, exactly. The, the cameras ha have sort of peaked. We've just

1801
01:47:41,965 --> 01:47:45,845
Speaker 9:  been doing multiple cameras. The ultimate trajectory

1802
01:47:45,905 --> 01:47:49,805
Speaker 9:  of smartphones is just to turn them back into DSLRs that can make

1803
01:47:49,805 --> 01:47:50,285
Speaker 9:  phone calls.

1804
01:47:50,545 --> 01:47:54,325
Speaker 8:  All I'm hearing is the lumia had this, right, like 12 years ago. The lumas

1805
01:47:54,325 --> 01:47:54,845
Speaker 8:  were correct.

1806
01:47:55,195 --> 01:47:58,445
Speaker 7:  What if, because there's two approaches here. The one is the what if the

1807
01:47:58,445 --> 01:48:01,525
Speaker 7:  main sensor was just a full on sensor, right?

1808
01:48:02,555 --> 01:48:06,465
Speaker 7:  Sure. And then there's what Jami is doing, I think, which is

1809
01:48:06,615 --> 01:48:10,585
Speaker 7:  what if we made a whole ass camera and just like mag safety it to

1810
01:48:10,585 --> 01:48:11,385
Speaker 7:  the back of the phone?

1811
01:48:11,935 --> 01:48:12,225
Speaker 9:  Yeah.

1812
01:48:14,845 --> 01:48:18,145
Speaker 7:  That's the one where it's like there's pogo pins. They're saying that it

1813
01:48:18,345 --> 01:48:21,665
Speaker 7:  communicates with like a, a laser communication system. Think

1814
01:48:21,665 --> 01:48:25,305
Speaker 9:  About how convenient it would be if in order to have the quality of

1815
01:48:25,305 --> 01:48:29,025
Speaker 9:  A-D-S-L-R on you at all times, all you had to do is carry an entire additional

1816
01:48:29,025 --> 01:48:30,625
Speaker 9:  lens that you could strap to your phone.

1817
01:48:33,305 --> 01:48:36,705
Speaker 9:  I, I want this to be great and this doesn't make any sense. So like,

1818
01:48:36,705 --> 01:48:40,425
Speaker 7:  It's a whole camera. It's got the sensor, the optics all in a

1819
01:48:40,505 --> 01:48:42,985
Speaker 7:  lens module and you just kinda like snap it on the back of a phone.

1820
01:48:43,165 --> 01:48:46,785
Speaker 9:  Oh, I didn't realize the, the sensor is in, in Xiaomi's lens.

1821
01:48:46,895 --> 01:48:48,345
Speaker 9:  Okay. That's pretty good actually. Right?

1822
01:48:48,345 --> 01:48:50,705
Speaker 7:  So the, the one, there's two of them. One of them is like, one

1823
01:48:50,705 --> 01:48:51,825
Speaker 9:  Of them is the exposed sensor.

1824
01:48:52,045 --> 01:48:55,345
Speaker 7:  One of 'em is the exposed sensor and then the lens is just go on it with

1825
01:48:55,505 --> 01:48:59,425
Speaker 7:  a regular mount. And that's like one idea, you know,

1826
01:48:59,495 --> 01:48:59,785
Speaker 7:  like

1827
01:49:00,455 --> 01:49:00,745
Speaker 9:  Idea

1828
01:49:01,175 --> 01:49:04,475
Speaker 7:  That's, If you just had the idea, that's the idea you would have. And then

1829
01:49:04,475 --> 01:49:07,915
Speaker 7:  there's x being like, ah, it's not quite ludicrous enough.

1830
01:49:08,265 --> 01:49:11,355
Speaker 7:  What if the sensor was in the lens and then every time you changed lenses,

1831
01:49:11,495 --> 01:49:13,035
Speaker 7:  you were also changing sensors.

1832
01:49:14,725 --> 01:49:18,625
Speaker 8:  My, my worst tech take has always been that

1833
01:49:18,625 --> 01:49:21,825
Speaker 8:  there is some very good idea in all of this. Like, do you remember the Samsung

1834
01:49:22,085 --> 01:49:25,825
Speaker 8:  Galaxy camera that was literally just a, a Samsung phone

1835
01:49:25,825 --> 01:49:27,225
Speaker 8:  strapped to a camera? Yeah,

1836
01:49:27,735 --> 01:49:28,025
Speaker 9:  That

1837
01:49:28,245 --> 01:49:32,225
Speaker 8:  Was a good idea. I remain 100% certain that a

1838
01:49:32,225 --> 01:49:34,745
Speaker 8:  point and shoot that runs full Android is a thing that should exist.

1839
01:49:34,925 --> 01:49:38,345
Speaker 9:  If you could watch Netflix on that thing, I I really think it would find

1840
01:49:38,345 --> 01:49:38,825
Speaker 9:  an audience.

1841
01:49:39,255 --> 01:49:42,465
Speaker 8:  Yeah, it's just like the, the creator economy is huge. Everybody is just

1842
01:49:42,465 --> 01:49:45,185
Speaker 8:  out here doing, like, you're telling me the people who like buy a second

1843
01:49:45,185 --> 01:49:49,085
Speaker 8:  phone just to make tiktoks, wouldn't buy a second phone with a kickass

1844
01:49:49,085 --> 01:49:49,565
Speaker 8:  lens on it.

1845
01:49:49,825 --> 01:49:53,605
Speaker 7:  So David, the funniest part of this story is that deep, deep in the

1846
01:49:53,605 --> 01:49:57,285
Speaker 7:  story, there is a link to Sony having this idea in 2013

1847
01:49:57,835 --> 01:50:01,605
Speaker 7:  with something called the Cyber Shot, QX 10 and QX 100. Yep. That story

1848
01:50:01,705 --> 01:50:04,045
Speaker 7:  was written by David Pierce for The Verge dot com,

1849
01:50:05,945 --> 01:50:06,725
Speaker 8:  10 outta 10.

1850
01:50:07,465 --> 01:50:11,165
Speaker 7:  And so you have a review of the QX 10 and your, your conclusion

1851
01:50:12,185 --> 01:50:15,005
Speaker 7:  was that the QX 10 was bad and the QX 100 was great.

1852
01:50:15,605 --> 01:50:19,085
Speaker 8:  I don't think any of that held up at all. I was right. No, no.

1853
01:50:19,665 --> 01:50:22,365
Speaker 8:  Can I get a readout on what the review scores were here?

1854
01:50:24,845 --> 01:50:25,605
Speaker 7:  I don't know. Oh

1855
01:50:25,605 --> 01:50:28,285
Speaker 8:  Yeah. This was the review I wrote about seeing Paul wrote on the Streets

1856
01:50:28,285 --> 01:50:28,445
Speaker 8:  of

1857
01:50:28,445 --> 01:50:32,285
Speaker 7:  New York City. The, the layouts are so broken after over a

1858
01:50:32,285 --> 01:50:36,125
Speaker 7:  decade, like 12 years later, these layouts are broken. So funny, one of the

1859
01:50:36,125 --> 01:50:38,445
Speaker 7:  pictures is just captioned with the word fire twice.

1860
01:50:40,785 --> 01:50:44,605
Speaker 8:  Fun fact. I don't know why. I literally, I have a picture of Paul Rudd in

1861
01:50:44,655 --> 01:50:48,205
Speaker 8:  cargo shorts that I took on this camera when I ran into

1862
01:50:48,205 --> 01:50:51,845
Speaker 7:  Him. Yeah. The, in downtown, the specific broken pole quote in this story

1863
01:50:51,865 --> 01:50:55,365
Speaker 7:  is the QX 10 is slightly better than your phone. The QX 100 blows it away.

1864
01:50:56,235 --> 01:50:57,365
Speaker 8:  Hell yeah. And

1865
01:50:57,525 --> 01:51:00,885
Speaker 7:  I think we all know what a huge hit the Sony Cyber shot QX one. All,

1866
01:51:00,905 --> 01:51:01,405
Speaker 8:  All I'm

1867

Speaker 7:  Hearing is history also, by the way, the score, I got to the score, the score

1868
01:51:04,005 --> 01:51:04,765

1869
01:51:06,555 --> 01:51:10,245
Speaker 8:  Sure. Seven. I dunno

1870
01:51:10,825 --> 01:51:14,445
Speaker 8:  the Yeah, I, I remember debating between the 0.2 and the 0.3 for a really

1871
01:51:14,445 --> 01:51:18,325
Speaker 8:  long time. All I'm hearing is history is proving David Wright and this

1872
01:51:18,325 --> 01:51:19,125
Speaker 8:  makes me really happy.
