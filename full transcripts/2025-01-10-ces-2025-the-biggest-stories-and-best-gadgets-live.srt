Description: In this special live episode of The Vergecast, from the Brooklyn Bowl in Las Vegas, it's time to talk CES. Nilay and David run through some of the show's biggest stories, plus the Meta news that dominated the conversations all week in Vegas. Then Allison Johnson, Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, and Victoria Song join the show to talk about all the newest, best, weirdest, and worst gadgets they've seen this year. AI is everywhere, everyone's making smart glasses, the smart home might be turning a corner, and we've seen it all this week.
Thanks to everyone who came out to the live show! And if you couldn't make it, stay tuned — this won't be the last time we all get to hang out.

Speaker 3:  over Brooklyn Bowl on our behalf. There's Vir has logos at the bar on

14
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:26,405
Speaker 3:  as much as we ever keep a VERGE cast on the rails. But I, I

15
00:01:26,405 --> 00:01:29,085
Speaker 3:  have to be honest with you, just the presence of this crowd has me knowing

16
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:32,365
Speaker 3:  that things are gonna get super weird on this episode of VERGE Cast, it's

17
00:01:32,365 --> 00:01:36,205
Speaker 3:  gonna be great. Jen, Allison and Vie are gonna join us. We're gonna talk

18
00:01:36,205 --> 00:01:39,445
Speaker 3:  about everything that's happening in cs, across their beats, across other

19
00:01:39,455 --> 00:01:42,925
Speaker 3:  beats. There's a helicopter that lands in a van that I really, really want

20
00:01:42,925 --> 00:01:43,365
Speaker 3:  to talk about.

21
00:01:43,865 --> 00:01:47,085
Speaker 4:  You've brought this up so many times now and you've like, you keep bringing

22
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:49,725
Speaker 4:  it up in such a way where you're like, you don't think it's cool, but you've

23
00:01:49,725 --> 00:01:53,005
Speaker 4:  now said it so many times that I'm like, NELI actually thinks this is very

24
00:01:53,005 --> 00:01:53,525
Speaker 4:  cool and

25
00:01:53,715 --> 00:01:55,725
Speaker 3:  It's lot we're gonna get into, I don't wanna, I don't wanna waste that we're

26
00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:56,165
Speaker 3:  gonna get into it,

27
00:01:57,825 --> 00:02:01,045
Speaker 3:  but there's, and we're gonna have lightning rounds obviously Search cast

28
00:02:01,975 --> 00:02:03,825
Speaker 4:  Sponsored by all these people, sponsored

29
00:02:03,825 --> 00:02:07,265
Speaker 3:  By all these people. David, tell me like, what's your vibe on CS this year?

30
00:02:08,165 --> 00:02:10,855
Speaker 4:  It's, it's been a weird CES.

31
00:02:12,145 --> 00:02:16,095
Speaker 4:  There hasn't been like the thing, like, I feel like last

32
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:19,895
Speaker 4:  year the rabbit R one, which sucks, was the thing

33
00:02:19,895 --> 00:02:23,095
Speaker 4:  at CES. It was like, it was the gadget that a lot of people were talking

34
00:02:23,095 --> 00:02:26,675
Speaker 4:  about and interested in. And this year it's like, it's, it's almost like

35
00:02:26,975 --> 00:02:30,035
Speaker 4:  two practical, like all the stuff I'm excited about and that we're gonna

36
00:02:30,035 --> 00:02:32,995
Speaker 4:  talk about is like real things that real people are gonna use, which is not

37
00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:36,795
Speaker 4:  what CES is about. Yeah. CES is about like deranged ideas about technology

38
00:02:37,175 --> 00:02:41,155
Speaker 4:  and there are lots of those and we will get to many of them. Yeah. Including

39
00:02:41,155 --> 00:02:44,875
Speaker 4:  helicopters that come out of the back of cars. But it, it just doesn't feel

40
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:48,555
Speaker 4:  like there has been like the, the one sort of breakout thing

41
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:52,275
Speaker 4:  yet, which in terms of like stuff that regular people will actually buy.

42
00:02:52,545 --> 00:02:56,475
Speaker 4:  It's probably a good CES on that front, but it doesn't feel

43
00:02:56,475 --> 00:02:57,995
Speaker 4:  quite csy that way. Yeah. Does that make

44
00:02:57,995 --> 00:03:01,895
Speaker 3:  Sense? So I have another theory about what's going on, CS and I, it's like

45
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:05,765
Speaker 3:  my face hugger theory of technology. Okay. Or

46
00:03:05,765 --> 00:03:09,445
Speaker 3:  like what, you know, an aliens like brush outta the chest. There's cs

47
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,645
Speaker 3:  the, the show that we all think we're coming to with the gadgets and the

48
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:16,605
Speaker 3:  TVs and whatever. And then at the aria there's the

49
00:03:16,885 --> 00:03:20,685
Speaker 3:  marketing people. Yes. There's some marketing people

50
00:03:20,685 --> 00:03:23,765
Speaker 3:  here. Be careful they're gonna latch onto your face and then

51
00:03:23,865 --> 00:03:27,285
Speaker 4:  On you can like it's literally, it's like much better dressed people walking

52
00:03:27,355 --> 00:03:30,365
Speaker 4:  much more intentionally at the Aria. Yes. Than at the Venetian.

53
00:03:30,675 --> 00:03:34,445
Speaker 3:  Well I'll get that one second. There are definitely better dressed intentionally

54
00:03:34,495 --> 00:03:38,485
Speaker 3:  seems maybe. So If you

55
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:41,365
Speaker 3:  just think about what's going on in technology broadly, right? We all have

56
00:03:41,365 --> 00:03:44,845
Speaker 3:  screens. The screens have apps. They show you video, they show you ai, slop,

57
00:03:45,045 --> 00:03:47,565
Speaker 3:  whatever they're showing you. And in the middle all that's funded by advertising.

58
00:03:47,785 --> 00:03:51,125
Speaker 3:  And sometime over the past decade the advertising industry realized that

59
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:54,525
Speaker 3:  they should be here. Where everyone's gonna talk about next year's screens

60
00:03:55,345 --> 00:03:57,985
Speaker 3:  and then they have the money and like

61
00:03:59,465 --> 00:04:02,805
Speaker 3:  the the car helicopter car guys like I'm here too.

62
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:07,045
Speaker 3:  And so it's just like this other parallel CES is here

63
00:04:07,495 --> 00:04:11,205
Speaker 3:  where If you want to meet 300 Meta executives, they're at the

64
00:04:11,525 --> 00:04:14,885
Speaker 3:  Aria. Yeah. They're not on the show floor. If you want to see the entire

65
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:18,845
Speaker 3:  Amazon's ads team or all the TikTok people, they're here. Like

66
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:22,485
Speaker 3:  a lot of the major company executives are here. They're just deal making

67
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:26,765
Speaker 3:  about ads somewhere else. And the show floor is like, it's

68
00:04:26,765 --> 00:04:29,645
Speaker 3:  not what it used to be. And So I think that's where you get the like there's

69
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:32,125
Speaker 3:  not one big thing that everyone's talking about. 'cause the one big thing

70
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:34,885
Speaker 3:  everyone's talking about is like programmatic advertising.

71
00:04:35,965 --> 00:04:38,855
Speaker 4:  Well and the other one is is ai, which

72
00:04:40,135 --> 00:04:42,975
Speaker 4:  I was talking to one of 'em gonna steal our thunder from one of our guests

73
00:04:42,975 --> 00:04:45,655
Speaker 4:  here who was saying basically like the strange thing about AI is you can't

74
00:04:45,655 --> 00:04:48,495
Speaker 4:  demo it to anybody. Yeah. Like it's just, it's, it's just like a thing that

75
00:04:48,495 --> 00:04:51,935
Speaker 4:  happens but it actually just looks like a television. So you're like, this

76
00:04:51,935 --> 00:04:55,015
Speaker 4:  television has a chat bot and it's like well A, what does that mean And B,

77
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:59,615
Speaker 4:  how do you show that on a show floor? So it's like Samsung just had a ship

78
00:04:59,615 --> 00:05:02,775
Speaker 4:  because that's the only thing there is to show is look, it's

79
00:05:03,015 --> 00:05:05,655
Speaker 3:  The Samsung booth has a sign in it and If you have been to the show floor,

80
00:05:05,715 --> 00:05:08,895
Speaker 3:  the Samsung booth has a sign in, it says smart things for ships. This is

81
00:05:08,895 --> 00:05:12,815
Speaker 3:  real. Which seems dangerous to me as a person who runs smart things in

82
00:05:12,815 --> 00:05:16,135
Speaker 3:  his home. We'll have Jen on later I'll, we can ask her if she thinks smart

83
00:05:16,135 --> 00:05:16,575
Speaker 3:  things is

84
00:05:16,575 --> 00:05:17,455
Speaker 4:  Appropriate. I would just say

85
00:05:17,555 --> 00:05:19,575
Speaker 3:  For sea bound navigation you

86
00:05:19,575 --> 00:05:22,535
Speaker 4:  Spend a tremendous amount of time talking about how your goal is boat money.

87
00:05:22,915 --> 00:05:26,735
Speaker 4:  And I feel like smart things for ships boat money, like there's a straight

88
00:05:26,735 --> 00:05:27,375
Speaker 4:  line in there for

89
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,975
Speaker 3:  You some. Well, so right next to smart Things for Ship is a sign that says

90
00:05:30,005 --> 00:05:33,815
Speaker 3:  society. It's not even like connected society, it's just the

91
00:05:33,815 --> 00:05:37,655
Speaker 3:  word society. And it's like Samsung is announcing society

92
00:05:37,715 --> 00:05:41,615
Speaker 3:  and next to society, their vision for it is that your ship will have

93
00:05:41,615 --> 00:05:43,895
Speaker 3:  smart home technology on it. And you're like, I think,

94
00:05:46,225 --> 00:05:50,185
Speaker 3:  I think this is a dangerous approach to what we're doing, but it's really

95
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:53,105
Speaker 3:  weird. Like Samsung is showing all these like solutions. There's no products

96
00:05:53,105 --> 00:05:55,985
Speaker 3:  in their booth, which is really weird. There's a model of a ship in the word

97
00:05:55,985 --> 00:05:58,805
Speaker 3:  society and then we're gonna talk about the Frame tv, I promise you we're

98
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:00,845
Speaker 3:  gonna talk about Frame tv. Those are the two wolves inside beach shows. And

99
00:06:00,845 --> 00:06:03,365
Speaker 3:  the Frame TV is not even being demoed in that booth. The art gallery, the

100
00:06:03,365 --> 00:06:06,765
Speaker 3:  Frame TV is being demoed in that booth. So it's just very odd

101
00:06:07,145 --> 00:06:11,085
Speaker 3:  moment for I think a lot of these companies where they're over the hardware

102
00:06:11,085 --> 00:06:14,645
Speaker 3:  race. Yeah. And then a bunch of the younger companies, the TCLs are like

103
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:16,085
Speaker 3:  still super in the hardware race.

104
00:06:17,725 --> 00:06:20,205
Speaker 3:  I will say, and we should talk about this quickly, we're gonna talk about

105
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:23,845
Speaker 3:  this a lot I suspect for the next four years because there are so many marketers

106
00:06:23,845 --> 00:06:26,965
Speaker 3:  here and because there are so many major technology company executives here.

107
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:31,405
Speaker 3:  Meta announced yesterday that they're getting rid of fact checking. They're

108
00:06:31,405 --> 00:06:33,805
Speaker 3:  going, they're changing their community standards. And we've been able to

109
00:06:33,805 --> 00:06:37,685
Speaker 3:  do a bunch of reporting about that 'cause everyone's here. And then sort

110
00:06:37,685 --> 00:06:41,485
Speaker 3:  of like what does it mean to advertise on Meta when their community

111
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:44,845
Speaker 3:  guidelines are changing is a thing that I've just had conversations about

112
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:48,725
Speaker 3:  because all of those folks are here and I, that's not

113
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:52,685
Speaker 3:  usually what you expect from cs. I'm assuming you came here to

114
00:06:52,725 --> 00:06:55,285
Speaker 3:  hear me rant about the Frame TV and not about Meta community guidelines,

115
00:06:55,445 --> 00:06:57,965
Speaker 3:  although it's The Vergecast. So you, I'm hoping that you all understand both

116
00:06:57,965 --> 00:06:59,325
Speaker 3:  things will always happen at the same time.

117
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:04,925
Speaker 3:  But that to me has been the story of the show just

118
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,725
Speaker 3:  because of the rooms I have happened to be in. Yeah. Everyone is talking

119
00:07:07,725 --> 00:07:11,005
Speaker 3:  about it. Oh for sure. 'cause it feels like the whole tech industry is now

120
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:14,605
Speaker 3:  in a much more transactional place. Cynically transactional.

121
00:07:15,465 --> 00:07:19,125
Speaker 3:  And that announcement coming on the first day of cs I think is no

122
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:22,925
Speaker 3:  accident of timing because all of Meta's marketers are here with their clients

123
00:07:23,775 --> 00:07:27,645
Speaker 3:  explaining what they mean when they say you can now refer to women

124
00:07:27,665 --> 00:07:30,405
Speaker 3:  as household objects on Meta. Which is a rule that they have changed. Yep.

125
00:07:30,405 --> 00:07:33,565
Speaker 3:  That's a rule that you can do. And the reason they announced it here is 'cause

126
00:07:33,565 --> 00:07:37,205
Speaker 3:  their salespeople are sitting with their biggest clients being like, here's

127
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:39,725
Speaker 3:  how this is actually gonna play out. And I think that has gotten a little

128
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:43,005
Speaker 3:  bit lost, right? Like yes, the timing is weird. Yes. It,

129
00:07:43,515 --> 00:07:45,565
Speaker 3:  mark Stocker made what appears to be like a hostage video.

130
00:07:47,145 --> 00:07:50,085
Speaker 3:  Is anyone here good at makeup? Can someone help him? So he is not always

131
00:07:50,085 --> 00:07:53,725
Speaker 3:  blown out in the T-zone. Like I'm only, I look great an eyeliner and that's

132
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:57,615
Speaker 3:  all I know how to do. But my goth phase did not. He always

133
00:07:57,615 --> 00:07:59,175
Speaker 3:  looks like he just needs to get evened out.

134
00:08:00,795 --> 00:08:02,175
Speaker 3:  That's just facts. But this is also

135
00:08:02,175 --> 00:08:04,775
Speaker 4:  Just what he does every four years now is make one of those videos where

136
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,655
Speaker 4:  he takes the opposite position of the one that he took four years ago.

137
00:08:07,825 --> 00:08:11,575
Speaker 3:  Right. And it's super cynical. I I think he's gotten a little bit radicalized,

138
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,975
Speaker 3:  right? He gets yelled at a lot. I think none of the big tech companies liked

139
00:08:14,975 --> 00:08:17,695
Speaker 3:  working with the Biden administration because the Biden administration's

140
00:08:17,815 --> 00:08:20,775
Speaker 3:  approach the big tech companies or what was effectively what If you didn't

141
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:24,725
Speaker 3:  exist, right? It's true. They all hated

142
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:28,245
Speaker 3:  Lena Khan. They all hated this Department of Justice. Google has two

143
00:08:28,315 --> 00:08:32,245
Speaker 3:  antitrust cases. Brewing Meta has a big one coming up in April.

144
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:36,725
Speaker 3:  That's I think the FTC is running about Instagram and WhatsApp and potentially

145
00:08:36,845 --> 00:08:40,285
Speaker 3:  breaking that apart. So I think they all just made their deal with the devil

146
00:08:40,345 --> 00:08:44,125
Speaker 3:  to be like, we give Trump money, maybe these problems will go away.

147
00:08:44,505 --> 00:08:48,325
Speaker 3:  And I think part of that is Mark literally using a lot of,

148
00:08:48,675 --> 00:08:52,445
Speaker 3:  like he says, the the legacy media is lying to you. Like in that

149
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:56,285
Speaker 3:  video he says transgenderism and he says that you can, the

150
00:08:56,285 --> 00:09:00,165
Speaker 3:  rule is now you can refer to being gay or transgender as a mental

151
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:04,005
Speaker 3:  illness. These are explicit, these are dog whistles to a community that

152
00:09:04,005 --> 00:09:07,885
Speaker 3:  is very, very receptive to them. And all of that is transactional. Right?

153
00:09:07,885 --> 00:09:10,765
Speaker 3:  Whether or not he believes that, I don't know. There's a lot of gay and trans

154
00:09:10,765 --> 00:09:13,925
Speaker 3:  people who work at Meta, like he has to support his own team in some way.

155
00:09:13,945 --> 00:09:15,245
Speaker 3:  And I think he's gonna have to explain that.

156
00:09:15,545 --> 00:09:18,965
Speaker 4:  It also doesn't matter. Like I think, I think the, the lesson we're learning

157
00:09:18,965 --> 00:09:22,805
Speaker 4:  here really quickly is that what Mark Zuckerberg believes, or what Tim Cook

158
00:09:22,805 --> 00:09:25,685
Speaker 4:  believes or what any of these folks believe actually doesn't matter. Like

159
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:29,205
Speaker 4:  they, they will run their companies as business people. And I think the,

160
00:09:29,205 --> 00:09:33,005
Speaker 4:  the thing that is happening is we, we either have to decide

161
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:36,965
Speaker 4:  to stop being surprised or like dedicate ourselves to continuing to

162
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:40,765
Speaker 4:  be angry that this happens. But this is just, everyone has just said what

163
00:09:40,765 --> 00:09:41,205
Speaker 4:  it is now.

164
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:44,725
Speaker 3:  I I was with another big tech company executive yesterday and they were just

165
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:46,925
Speaker 3:  like, we're treating the this this time it's business.

166
00:09:48,435 --> 00:09:51,035
Speaker 3:  I was, I was just the point of view that they had and I, it's

167
00:09:51,035 --> 00:09:53,395
Speaker 4:  Just been business the whole time. But I think that there was, there was

168
00:09:53,515 --> 00:09:57,235
Speaker 4:  a long period of time where there was a sense that like, okay, maybe

169
00:09:57,575 --> 00:10:01,195
Speaker 4:  we are going to buy into this new world where like young people care about

170
00:10:01,195 --> 00:10:04,675
Speaker 4:  values and each other and we're gonna save the world and you know, ESG is

171
00:10:04,675 --> 00:10:07,075
Speaker 4:  gonna be a part. And then everybody has decided, oh nevermind. That's actually

172
00:10:07,075 --> 00:10:10,995
Speaker 4:  not what it is. We're just going to win at capitalism. And that is, that

173
00:10:10,995 --> 00:10:11,435
Speaker 4:  is the game.

174
00:10:11,585 --> 00:10:14,875
Speaker 3:  Yeah. So we're gonna cover this a lot. I think over the next four years

175
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:18,915
Speaker 3:  we already have some further coverage scheduled for next week on both the

176
00:10:18,915 --> 00:10:22,795
Speaker 3:  site and the podcast. But I just, I wanted to call it out being one because

177
00:10:22,795 --> 00:10:26,555
Speaker 3:  we're like, what's the story of CES? For me, part of the story of

178
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:30,675
Speaker 3:  CS is the marketing industry is here, like in force it

179
00:10:30,675 --> 00:10:34,595
Speaker 3:  is driving the show in a way that is basically invisible even on

180
00:10:34,595 --> 00:10:37,315
Speaker 3:  our site. Like our site is basically like, look at this laptop, it folds

181
00:10:37,315 --> 00:10:41,235
Speaker 3:  in half. And that's really fun and I love it. But the money here is all

182
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,515
Speaker 3:  is all in the aria. It's all, a lot of people talking about how to command

183
00:10:44,515 --> 00:10:47,995
Speaker 3:  attention and the story of the show over there

184
00:10:48,535 --> 00:10:51,995
Speaker 3:  has been the biggest advertising platform around has made this big

185
00:10:51,995 --> 00:10:55,955
Speaker 3:  capitulation, this very transactional, very cynical capitulation. And

186
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:59,515
Speaker 3:  I think that's gonna have repercussions across the tech industry. Yeah. Because

187
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,435
Speaker 3:  If you don't have to spend $270 million in Pennsylvania,

188
00:11:03,545 --> 00:11:06,595
Speaker 3:  like you don't, you won't. And I think they're all gonna learn that lesson

189
00:11:06,595 --> 00:11:10,395
Speaker 3:  from Mark. And I think the question is like, does anybody, does anybody here

190
00:11:10,395 --> 00:11:13,195
Speaker 3:  think Mark Zuckerberg is not like a ruthless transactional businessman

191
00:11:14,665 --> 00:11:18,275
Speaker 3:  bowling? Yeah. He gave one of these. Yeah.

192
00:11:18,555 --> 00:11:21,995
Speaker 3:  Like a half and half. Does anyone think Tim Cook is not a ruthlessly

193
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:25,965
Speaker 3:  transactional businessman Like Tim Cook famously the why are you

194
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:29,045
Speaker 3:  still here story. You guys know the story where like they were talking about

195
00:11:29,045 --> 00:11:31,845
Speaker 3:  some problem with the supplier in China and his lieutenant was here and he

196
00:11:31,845 --> 00:11:33,885
Speaker 3:  looked at him and he said, why are you still here? And the guy got up, left

197
00:11:33,885 --> 00:11:37,165
Speaker 3:  the room and flew to China. Yeah. That guy, he's gonna be able to handle

198
00:11:37,165 --> 00:11:40,525
Speaker 3:  it, right? He handled Trump excellently the first time. Bezos

199
00:11:40,895 --> 00:11:43,805
Speaker 3:  ruthlessly transactional businessman. Yep. And then you've got like Sundar,

200
00:11:44,575 --> 00:11:48,545
Speaker 3:  like can he do it? Like, can Evan Spiegel roll up to Mar-a-Lago and

201
00:11:48,545 --> 00:11:52,165
Speaker 3:  be like, I've redesigned the Snapchat interface again.

202
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:56,645
Speaker 3:  Like I think all like this is gonna have huge repercussions across the tech

203
00:11:56,885 --> 00:11:59,925
Speaker 3:  industry. 'cause you need to be all kind of personality. And so we're gonna

204
00:11:59,925 --> 00:12:01,285
Speaker 3:  cover it I think for the next four years. But,

205
00:12:02,465 --> 00:12:02,685
Speaker 4:  But

206
00:12:02,685 --> 00:12:04,925
Speaker 3:  That's it. Now we should cover gadgets. Can we

207
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:08,685
Speaker 4:  Talk about the biggest question of CES? This is the, the the all that stuff

208
00:12:08,685 --> 00:12:12,485
Speaker 4:  is, you know, more important. Whatever the question I have about CES is,

209
00:12:12,505 --> 00:12:14,805
Speaker 4:  is the Frame Pro actually a good television? Oh my

210
00:12:14,805 --> 00:12:16,085
Speaker 3:  God. All right. Have you,

211
00:12:16,405 --> 00:12:20,165
Speaker 4:  I mean this question sincerely. So Chris Welch on our team wrote about the,

212
00:12:20,225 --> 00:12:23,525
Speaker 4:  the saying Samsung, the frame. I've learned that it's not called the Frame

213
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:27,005
Speaker 4:  television, it's called The Frame, which is ridiculous and I hate it. But

214
00:12:27,185 --> 00:12:31,165
Speaker 4:  The Frame Pro is a new tv and he started by being like, oh,

215
00:12:31,165 --> 00:12:34,485
Speaker 4:  this thing might kick ass. It's very cool. Lots of new stuff. And over the

216
00:12:34,485 --> 00:12:38,445
Speaker 4:  course of like 72 hours has come to basically I have been lied to. This

217
00:12:38,445 --> 00:12:41,325
Speaker 4:  thing might be awful. And So I wanna know, I wanna know how you feel.

218
00:12:41,565 --> 00:12:43,845
Speaker 3:  I want one, I want to point out as America's, I have not spent any time with

219
00:12:43,845 --> 00:12:45,965
Speaker 3:  Chris. He came to that conclusion independently as America's

220
00:12:46,445 --> 00:12:50,335
Speaker 4:  Foremost frame owner. Which is a thing.

221
00:12:50,335 --> 00:12:52,135
Speaker 4:  You just have to, you have to wear it. I I

222
00:12:52,135 --> 00:12:55,395
Speaker 3:  Do own one. How many people do you have A Frame tv. All right.

223
00:12:56,185 --> 00:12:56,675
Speaker 3:  Bowlers,

224
00:12:56,945 --> 00:12:58,595
Speaker 4:  NELI owes all of you money. Yeah, I just want

225
00:12:58,595 --> 00:13:02,195
Speaker 3:  That that was just a fist in the air. You're just like, yeah, frame tv, lots

226
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:05,715
Speaker 3:  of frame TVs. I have a Frame tv, everybody knows A Frame tv. The Frame TV

227
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,755
Speaker 3:  represents the death of Hollywood. I want you to, every time you turn on

228
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:11,915
Speaker 3:  this tv, I want you to be like, what I'm doing is killing Hollywood. And

229
00:13:11,915 --> 00:13:15,835
Speaker 3:  I mean that, I mean that in a very real sense. It is also Samsung's biggest

230
00:13:15,835 --> 00:13:19,315
Speaker 3:  success. It is a cultural product, not a tech product.

231
00:13:19,655 --> 00:13:22,715
Speaker 3:  You buy this thing 'cause it looks good when it's off. You buy this thing

232
00:13:22,995 --> 00:13:25,275
Speaker 3:  'cause it has an art store. How many people are paying the 50 bucks a month

233
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:29,205
Speaker 3:  for the art store? How many people are that? One person will admit

234
00:13:29,205 --> 00:13:31,125
Speaker 3:  it. How many of you're paying for it and you just don't wanna admit it in

235
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:34,165
Speaker 3:  this room with me right now, I I pay the money too. All right.

236
00:13:35,385 --> 00:13:39,325
Speaker 3:  It is a cultural product. It is not a technology product. And that is the

237
00:13:39,325 --> 00:13:41,765
Speaker 3:  thing everybody wants. The iPhone is a cultural product. It's not a technology

238
00:13:41,765 --> 00:13:45,365
Speaker 3:  product. It's a very high end technology product. But inherently it's a cultural

239
00:13:45,365 --> 00:13:49,125
Speaker 3:  product. So Samsung can have influencers and HT TV and interior

240
00:13:49,365 --> 00:13:52,605
Speaker 3:  designers sell the frame TV as like a statement piece that you put in your

241
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:56,285
Speaker 3:  living room. I have a Frame tv. My, I have a new neighbor and they redid

242
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:58,765
Speaker 3:  their living room and they were like, we bought the Frame tv. And they're

243
00:13:58,765 --> 00:14:00,685
Speaker 3:  like, it's not a Real Frame tv. And I was like, why are you bidding this

244
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:03,765
Speaker 3:  to me? No one like shows me any other product. And it's like, it's not the

245
00:14:03,765 --> 00:14:07,485
Speaker 3:  real one that doesn't happen. But the Frame TV has achieved the status

246
00:14:07,745 --> 00:14:11,485
Speaker 3:  and the fact that it is a bad TV is like

247
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:15,445
Speaker 3:  totally secondary to its status. It is a shit tv.

248
00:14:15,785 --> 00:14:18,885
Speaker 3:  I'm sorry. You don't, you don't have, you don't have, you can just, it's

249
00:14:18,885 --> 00:14:20,965
Speaker 3:  fine that I know it and you know it, you don't have to tell anyone else.

250
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:25,725
Speaker 3:  But it is a 7-year-old Edge lit panel that Samsung

251
00:14:25,945 --> 00:14:29,725
Speaker 3:  has long since made its margin on. And now they're selling them

252
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:33,805
Speaker 3:  for like three bills. Like a lot of you paid thousands of dollars for your

253
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:37,765
Speaker 3:  Frame TV when the core component of it is like a $200 Samsung panel

254
00:14:37,765 --> 00:14:40,765
Speaker 3:  from seven years ago. But it's all the stuff they've layered onto it. Right?

255
00:14:40,785 --> 00:14:44,725
Speaker 3:  The Matt display, they break out the box, they make it flat, you can buy

256
00:14:44,725 --> 00:14:48,525
Speaker 3:  the frames. I have a lot to say about the Frames and they art store.

257
00:14:48,585 --> 00:14:52,125
Speaker 3:  So they're, they're making all of this margin based on the lifestyle value

258
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,485
Speaker 3:  of the product on the product itself. And so the Frame Pro,

259
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:58,085
Speaker 4:  This is such a long way of explaining why you bought a terrible television

260
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:02,125
Speaker 4:  that has not yet answered my question. So Samsung, the thing this time was

261
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:05,245
Speaker 4:  they were like, what if we made it a good tv? And it sounds like they didn't

262
00:15:05,425 --> 00:15:05,805
Speaker 4:  do that.

263
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:08,365
Speaker 3:  They didn't do that. So they, they got to use some words.

264
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:13,525
Speaker 3:  So the ba so you know Edge Lit TV has the lights around the edge

265
00:15:13,525 --> 00:15:17,445
Speaker 3:  of the screen that light up the, the LCD panel. The new hot tech

266
00:15:17,505 --> 00:15:20,925
Speaker 3:  is mini LED back lights. I have lots and lots of small back lights you can

267
00:15:20,925 --> 00:15:23,725
Speaker 3:  turn on off the zones, you get true blacks. And then you know I have eds

268
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:27,045
Speaker 3:  which are the, that's what I have. That's actually what I have. Our Frame

269
00:15:27,045 --> 00:15:29,805
Speaker 3:  TV is in our bedroom and my daughter watches Moana. I don't want, she's sick.

270
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:30,765
Speaker 3:  That's why we own that tv.

271
00:15:33,755 --> 00:15:37,535
Speaker 3:  So Samsung is saying we've made it mini LED which everyone you're supposed

272
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:41,055
Speaker 3:  to think they're on the cutting edge of the technology 'cause they can't

273
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:44,995
Speaker 3:  use oled. 'cause If you put art on an OLED picture for days at a time,

274
00:15:44,995 --> 00:15:48,435
Speaker 3:  you'll burn out the oled. So they can't use the best technology. So they

275
00:15:48,435 --> 00:15:52,035
Speaker 3:  say they're using this up and coming disruptive technology called mini where

276
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:55,995
Speaker 3:  every other mini LED TV has thousands if not tens of thousands of

277
00:15:55,995 --> 00:15:59,835
Speaker 3:  dimming zones that let them simulate an OLED black level. But Samsung isn't

278
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:02,635
Speaker 3:  doing that. They just put them around the fucking edge of the TV so they

279
00:16:02,635 --> 00:16:06,235
Speaker 3:  can crank 'em really bright so the TV can get brighter. So they still have

280
00:16:06,235 --> 00:16:09,315
Speaker 3:  an edge lit panel, like they haven't done

281
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:11,235
Speaker 3:  anything. Well

282
00:16:11,235 --> 00:16:12,435
Speaker 4:  They did something. What

283
00:16:12,435 --> 00:16:13,075
Speaker 3:  Did they do? But they

284
00:16:13,075 --> 00:16:15,595
Speaker 4:  Didn't do the thing that they should have done. Which is make it a better

285
00:16:15,605 --> 00:16:16,275
Speaker 4:  television.

286
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:19,315
Speaker 3:  I don't think it matters when I say it's the death of Hollywood. What I mean

287
00:16:19,315 --> 00:16:21,915
Speaker 3:  is you all bought this to, I keep pointing it all you this like Jacques,

288
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,875
Speaker 3:  how dare you all

289
00:16:23,995 --> 00:16:26,555
Speaker 4:  Of these, these monsters bought this television. Yeah,

290
00:16:26,555 --> 00:16:30,155
Speaker 3:  This every Hollywood celebrity, you know, is mad at you. Tom Cruise is gonna

291
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,115
Speaker 3:  come in here and turn off motion smoothing one by one.

292
00:16:33,975 --> 00:16:37,115
Speaker 3:  But you bought a TV that is better when it's off.

293
00:16:37,785 --> 00:16:41,635
Speaker 3:  Like substantially better in its off state than it's on

294
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:44,995
Speaker 3:  state. Like the picture quality when the frame TV is off is better than when

295
00:16:44,995 --> 00:16:48,475
Speaker 3:  it's on. And that's cool like that. That's why we have one in our bedroom.

296
00:16:48,755 --> 00:16:52,515
Speaker 3:  'cause it's mostly off. It's such a small step from there

297
00:16:53,215 --> 00:16:55,835
Speaker 3:  to just hanging a real picture on your wall.

298
00:16:57,145 --> 00:17:00,835
Speaker 3:  It's such a small step from there to what's the, there's an e ink, like

299
00:17:01,115 --> 00:17:03,075
Speaker 3:  color e ink frame that they're selling here.

300
00:17:03,145 --> 00:17:04,635
Speaker 4:  It's a poster. You have to charge it once a

301
00:17:04,635 --> 00:17:07,795
Speaker 3:  Year that has an art store. It's such a small step to that. It's such a small

302
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:11,565
Speaker 3:  step to not having a TV because your,

303
00:17:11,635 --> 00:17:15,445
Speaker 3:  your TV is off showing you $50 a year content from

304
00:17:15,545 --> 00:17:17,205
Speaker 3:  the MoMA while you're on TikTok.

305
00:17:17,425 --> 00:17:21,245
Speaker 4:  Can I offer you a different idea? Which is the new LG stand by Me too. Which

306
00:17:21,245 --> 00:17:24,245
Speaker 4:  is just a thing you carry with a strap. This is a why a television when you

307
00:17:24,245 --> 00:17:25,405
Speaker 4:  can have a television with you all the time.

308
00:17:25,965 --> 00:17:28,485
Speaker 3:  Have you guys seen this Stand by Me too. It has a strap, but then it also

309
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,165
Speaker 3:  has a, so it's just a TV with a battery and it, a battery lasts for like

310
00:17:31,165 --> 00:17:34,565
Speaker 3:  four hours. It's very funny. The, you know, the first one was a suitcase.

311
00:17:34,705 --> 00:17:38,045
Speaker 3:  It came in like a, like a James Bond style suitcase

312
00:17:38,435 --> 00:17:41,085
Speaker 3:  with a, he would play solitaire on it. So he'd be like, I'm James Bond. And

313
00:17:41,085 --> 00:17:45,045
Speaker 3:  he'd be like, we're playing solitaire. But it ha the now it

314
00:17:45,045 --> 00:17:48,845
Speaker 3:  has a strap, it has a giant surface style kickstand attachment.

315
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:53,565
Speaker 3:  So you can just make it a giant tablet computer, which is very cool. Everyone

316
00:17:53,645 --> 00:17:56,485
Speaker 3:  I saw encounter this thing in the LGB earth was captivated by it.

317
00:17:56,595 --> 00:18:00,005
Speaker 4:  It's literally just a huge iPad without a touchscreen, which is both.

318
00:18:00,315 --> 00:18:03,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's ridiculous and kind of great.

319
00:18:03,235 --> 00:18:03,525
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

320
00:18:03,585 --> 00:18:05,925
Speaker 4:  And they're, they're showing it. There's like the, the big ideas, like you'll

321
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:09,725
Speaker 4:  you'll hang it up at your coffee shop to show the menu or whatever and that's

322
00:18:09,725 --> 00:18:13,485
Speaker 4:  all fine and good. But I, I want this thing to just like wander around my

323
00:18:13,485 --> 00:18:16,965
Speaker 4:  house with me and just, I just sit it next to me as I watch shows.

324
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,325
Speaker 4:  Like that's what I do with my phone all the time now. I'm like,

325
00:18:20,555 --> 00:18:24,205
Speaker 3:  It's a pop to not having a tv. What you are describing is a person

326
00:18:24,205 --> 00:18:27,045
Speaker 3:  without a television. And every now and again, you're gonna bring out your

327
00:18:27,045 --> 00:18:30,165
Speaker 3:  little shoulder strap TV and you're gonna like watch a show and you're gonna

328
00:18:30,165 --> 00:18:33,885
Speaker 3:  put it away. And once that hap like the culture

329
00:18:34,105 --> 00:18:37,685
Speaker 3:  of the world changes once, the default is we don't have TVs.

330
00:18:37,985 --> 00:18:41,765
Speaker 3:  And I, I promise you the Samsung Frame TV is the leading indicator of

331
00:18:41,815 --> 00:18:45,795
Speaker 3:  eventually not having TVs. I mean, and the frame Pro is a con

332
00:18:45,815 --> 00:18:49,435
Speaker 3:  and I just wanna be very careful about this. Like who, what professional

333
00:18:49,435 --> 00:18:53,315
Speaker 3:  needs this tele, like what are we doing? But we are

334
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:55,315
Speaker 3:  fully into lightning round by the way. I just wanna be clear. Yeah.

335
00:18:55,315 --> 00:18:57,795
Speaker 4:  So can can I just burn you through some more news? Yeah. Before we bring

336
00:18:57,795 --> 00:19:00,115
Speaker 4:  out our, our friends to talk about more interesting stuff than your weird

337
00:19:00,115 --> 00:19:03,995
Speaker 4:  ideas about television. Can we talk about Dell just for like a, just for

338
00:19:03,995 --> 00:19:07,035
Speaker 4:  like a minute. I just need to be very mad at Dell out loud on this podcast.

339
00:19:07,265 --> 00:19:08,235
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So Dell,

340
00:19:08,655 --> 00:19:09,715
Speaker 3:  That's a CS tradition

341
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:13,595
Speaker 4:  Dell, which had a million names of products for its

342
00:19:13,595 --> 00:19:17,195
Speaker 4:  laptops that no one could ever make sense of. Now has fewer names for its

343
00:19:17,195 --> 00:19:20,555
Speaker 4:  products that make somehow even less sense. So Dell has completely renamed

344
00:19:20,615 --> 00:19:21,075
Speaker 4:  its whole,

345
00:19:21,265 --> 00:19:22,595
Speaker 3:  They got rid of XPS.

346
00:19:22,725 --> 00:19:23,635
Speaker 4:  Right? Which

347
00:19:23,815 --> 00:19:25,235
Speaker 3:  Was this, which was a good brand.

348
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:28,155
Speaker 4:  It was like the best Windows computer. And they're like, ah, nevermind. So

349
00:19:28,155 --> 00:19:29,915
Speaker 4:  now there is the, there is the Dell.

350
00:19:30,685 --> 00:19:30,975
Speaker 3:  Just

351
00:19:30,975 --> 00:19:34,535
Speaker 4:  Dell. Just Dell. So you, you just like, I'll have a Dell please. It's like

352
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:38,095
Speaker 4:  a thing you can do now there's also the Dell Pro and there's the Dell Max.

353
00:19:39,305 --> 00:19:42,765
Speaker 4:  And if you're like David, that doesn't make sense. I have more for you. Within

354
00:19:42,835 --> 00:19:46,605
Speaker 4:  each of those tiers there is a Premium a plus and a base tier.

355
00:19:47,345 --> 00:19:51,285
Speaker 4:  So there is, there is now a Dell base. I'd like a Dell

356
00:19:51,285 --> 00:19:53,645
Speaker 4:  base please. That's sure.

357
00:19:53,665 --> 00:19:54,645
Speaker 3:  That's like a rental car

358
00:19:54,785 --> 00:19:56,805
Speaker 4:  All the way up to a Dell Max Premium.

359
00:19:57,255 --> 00:19:58,685
Speaker 3:  Which Dell Max Premium,

360
00:19:59,005 --> 00:20:00,685
Speaker 4:  I assume it costs $16 million.

361
00:20:01,745 --> 00:20:03,965
Speaker 3:  Are they, are they different products?

362
00:20:05,025 --> 00:20:08,305
Speaker 4:  I honestly couldn't tell you. I don't think Dell knows. I really don't. I

363
00:20:08,305 --> 00:20:10,585
Speaker 4:  think they just like had a bunch of laptops and they were like, we don't

364
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:13,505
Speaker 4:  know what any of these are anymore because we just have infinite skews of

365
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:15,745
Speaker 4:  things and just put a bunch of them in buckets and we're like,

366
00:20:17,445 --> 00:20:17,795
Speaker 3:  There

367
00:20:17,795 --> 00:20:18,795
Speaker 4:  You go. Shipped these to Best Buy.

368
00:20:19,015 --> 00:20:20,235
Speaker 3:  And the middle one is plus

369
00:20:20,615 --> 00:20:21,315
Speaker 4:  The middle one is plus,

370
00:20:21,315 --> 00:20:22,555
Speaker 3:  So you can get a Dell Max plus

371
00:20:22,695 --> 00:20:25,875
Speaker 4:  You can't. That's correct. Or a Dell Pro plus.

372
00:20:27,015 --> 00:20:28,015
Speaker 4:  I hate this so much.

373
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,135
Speaker 3:  You're so mad.

374
00:20:30,055 --> 00:20:33,495
Speaker 4:  I have always said that my future is to just start a consultancy where I

375
00:20:33,495 --> 00:20:36,775
Speaker 4:  will walk into your boardroom say that name is the stupidest thing I've ever

376
00:20:36,775 --> 00:20:40,535
Speaker 4:  heard leave. And you, you owe me $50,000. Like I'll be the one to say to

377
00:20:40,535 --> 00:20:42,615
Speaker 4:  your CEO. That's the stupidest idea you've ever had.

378
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,815
Speaker 3:  That's why people hire consultants. This is what

379
00:20:44,815 --> 00:20:48,725
Speaker 4:  I'm saying. I will do that for so cheap. Right. If it saves us

380
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:52,525
Speaker 4:  from stupid names like this. But anyway, so that sucks. The computers I'm

381
00:20:52,525 --> 00:20:56,365
Speaker 4:  sure will be fine. Dell has made fine computers for a very long time. Can

382
00:20:56,365 --> 00:21:00,295
Speaker 4:  we talk about the Sony ELA car for just a hot second? Do we think this

383
00:21:00,295 --> 00:21:04,095
Speaker 4:  exists now we have a price. This thing has been at CES in various forms of

384
00:21:04,165 --> 00:21:06,615
Speaker 4:  prototype for three years now.

385
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,455
Speaker 3:  Yeah, four years. They, they over, have you guys seen the Eila? It's

386
00:21:10,725 --> 00:21:14,695
Speaker 3:  just a sedan like, I dunno, it looks like

387
00:21:14,735 --> 00:21:17,655
Speaker 3:  a Lucid air, but Sony did it, you know, it's a

388
00:21:17,655 --> 00:21:20,815
Speaker 3:  $89,000. I was with some people today like walking around the show floor

389
00:21:20,995 --> 00:21:24,255
Speaker 3:  and I was like, this is Sony's car, it's a sedan that costs

390
00:21:24,255 --> 00:21:27,855
Speaker 3:  $89,000. And they like just a group of people.

391
00:21:28,275 --> 00:21:32,145
Speaker 3:  Gfa like I'm, I feel very bad for Sony Honda. They announced this

392
00:21:32,145 --> 00:21:35,905
Speaker 3:  thing five years ago at the height of infinite demand

393
00:21:35,925 --> 00:21:39,385
Speaker 3:  for Tesla. Like where Tesla was like, we can't make model wise fast enough.

394
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:43,365
Speaker 3:  And every car company was like, well what if we announced a car that

395
00:21:43,365 --> 00:21:46,885
Speaker 3:  we're gonna ship five years from now to fill some of that model wide demand.

396
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:47,525
Speaker 3:  And our

397
00:21:47,525 --> 00:21:50,085
Speaker 4:  Only idea about it is that it has PlayStation in it somehow.

398
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:54,405
Speaker 3:  Yeah. So I mean, so Sony's giant worry is that the cars will drive themselves

399
00:21:54,505 --> 00:21:57,965
Speaker 3:  and then people you'll the, you'll have more free time. 'cause in you're

400
00:21:57,965 --> 00:22:00,925
Speaker 3:  like living room on wheels, going to wherever you're going and your autonomous

401
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:04,565
Speaker 3:  car. And Sony should program the content and advertising

402
00:22:04,835 --> 00:22:08,285
Speaker 3:  that you consume during that time. And I've heard this idea from

403
00:22:08,765 --> 00:22:12,085
Speaker 3:  multiple entertainment companies, multiple car companies, that once we have

404
00:22:12,085 --> 00:22:15,205
Speaker 3:  autonomous cars, you drive around living room on wheels, whoever wins that

405
00:22:15,205 --> 00:22:18,765
Speaker 3:  fight to program, that screen is the next winner. And I'm just like, you

406
00:22:18,765 --> 00:22:22,485
Speaker 3:  know, the people still have phones. You have to beat my iPhone

407
00:22:22,485 --> 00:22:26,445
Speaker 3:  still. Like I get in an Uber all the time. The Uber drives around just

408
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:30,085
Speaker 3:  fine. I'm not like, I hope somebody like I turn off the screen in the back

409
00:22:30,085 --> 00:22:31,125
Speaker 3:  of the taxi. I wanna look at my

410
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:33,565
Speaker 4:  Phone. I do play the trivia games back there every once in a while. Oh no,

411
00:22:33,565 --> 00:22:34,805
Speaker 4:  they're so fun. You're

412
00:22:34,805 --> 00:22:36,125
Speaker 3:  Being so ruthlessly tracked.

413
00:22:36,305 --> 00:22:39,565
Speaker 4:  Oh, I'm, yeah, it's fine. They know how good I am at trivia. Like it's, it's

414
00:22:39,565 --> 00:22:41,885
Speaker 3:  Not a run. But I, but so they have announced the price and then I think a

415
00:22:41,885 --> 00:22:45,725
Speaker 3:  really funny thing is, you know, the IFA is the Sony Honda Mobility joint

416
00:22:45,725 --> 00:22:48,645
Speaker 3:  venture where Honda's doing a car and then Sony's programming. The experience

417
00:22:48,645 --> 00:22:51,405
Speaker 3:  isn't on the car. And you can like, you can in fact play PlayStation in the

418
00:22:51,405 --> 00:22:54,805
Speaker 3:  back of the ifa. Great. But at the same time, at this very show,

419
00:22:55,095 --> 00:22:58,985
Speaker 3:  Honda is showing off its own cooler cars and you're just like,

420
00:22:58,985 --> 00:23:02,265
Speaker 3:  hey, it's an $89,000 sedan that you don't like. Like this thing is doomed.

421
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:06,495
Speaker 3:  I hope none of you have pre-ordered ela. If, If you, If you, you know,

422
00:23:06,495 --> 00:23:09,815
Speaker 3:  have fun, you know, life is a series of experiences that you're allowed to

423
00:23:09,815 --> 00:23:13,775
Speaker 3:  have. But the actual Honda cars look way cooler, like

424
00:23:14,085 --> 00:23:17,215
Speaker 3:  much more futuristic. There's a, they they keep calling it a saloon, which

425
00:23:17,215 --> 00:23:21,055
Speaker 3:  is just what British people say instead of station Wagon. And it's like just

426
00:23:21,135 --> 00:23:21,455
Speaker 3:  a long,

427
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,335
Speaker 4:  I just learned that this week by the way. It's awesome. That's such a better

428
00:23:24,335 --> 00:23:28,095
Speaker 4:  name than Station Wagon. Yeah. Like a saloon car is cool,

429
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,895
Speaker 3:  But it does imply that there'll be like swinging doors and the British have

430
00:23:31,895 --> 00:23:32,575
Speaker 3:  once again lied to us,

431
00:23:34,435 --> 00:23:37,735
Speaker 3:  but it's like just such a cool looking car. It makes a lot of sense. Like

432
00:23:37,955 --> 00:23:40,855
Speaker 3:  you can see Honda's really thought about repackaging a car around a battery

433
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:43,455
Speaker 3:  instead of what most car makers are doing, which is like putting a battery

434
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:47,365
Speaker 3:  in existing design and playing it safe but no price, no

435
00:23:47,445 --> 00:23:50,645
Speaker 3:  ship date. We're like ages away. We're still in vaporware carland. And then

436
00:23:50,645 --> 00:23:52,565
Speaker 3:  the other thing that's really interesting is none of the other car makers

437
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:56,245
Speaker 3:  are here. And so for years, you know, Mercedes would be here and be like,

438
00:23:56,245 --> 00:23:59,925
Speaker 3:  this car has OLEDs on the outside and then BM bmw, like our car has e ink

439
00:23:59,925 --> 00:24:03,165
Speaker 3:  on the outside. And she'd be like, what about the inside of a car?

440
00:24:03,945 --> 00:24:07,285
Speaker 3:  And then they would show you crazy ideas for, you know, interactive cockpits

441
00:24:07,285 --> 00:24:10,645
Speaker 3:  and they would talk about EVs endlessly and autonomy endlessly. And none

442
00:24:10,645 --> 00:24:11,485
Speaker 3:  of them are here this year.

443
00:24:11,615 --> 00:24:15,565
Speaker 4:  We've seen such a trend like in the last 12 months of all of

444
00:24:15,565 --> 00:24:19,005
Speaker 4:  these companies walking back from these wild ideas. Yeah. Because there was

445
00:24:19,005 --> 00:24:22,205
Speaker 4:  a minute where it was like, this is, this is the future and it is coming

446
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:25,765
Speaker 4:  right now. And now everybody's like, this is potentially the future and it's

447
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:28,445
Speaker 4:  coming in a very long time because we can't figure out how to charge these

448
00:24:28,445 --> 00:24:28,605
Speaker 4:  things.

449
00:24:28,775 --> 00:24:32,405
Speaker 3:  Right. They were counting paradigms, they're counting on widespread electrification,

450
00:24:32,655 --> 00:24:35,485
Speaker 3:  which they have largely achieved in China, but they can't talk about that

451
00:24:35,485 --> 00:24:39,245
Speaker 3:  here. And they are counting on autonomy and

452
00:24:39,615 --> 00:24:42,405
Speaker 3:  those things are just not happening at the rate that Yeah. Anyone wants em

453
00:24:42,405 --> 00:24:43,725
Speaker 3:  to. Yeah. Waymo is here and they,

454
00:26:24,145 --> 00:26:26,965
Speaker 4:  Alison Johnson's over here. Alison, come hang out with us. Let's talk about

455
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:28,605
Speaker 4:  CES. Yeah, welcome Alison. Everybody.

456
00:26:32,065 --> 00:26:36,005
Speaker 4:  Alison has been talking about a phone toaster nonstop for several

457
00:26:36,035 --> 00:26:36,325
Speaker 4:  days,

458
00:26:37,895 --> 00:26:41,885
Speaker 4:  which I feel like you bring, bring your mic over. Okay. There's a bunch

459
00:26:41,885 --> 00:26:44,125
Speaker 4:  of stuff we should talk about, but can we just talk about the phone toaster?

460
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:46,205
Speaker 4:  We're sorry. I feel like you've like really oversold. We're

461
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:49,885
Speaker 7:  Gonna get right the phone toaster. Okay. Phone toaster. So the story is

462
00:26:50,765 --> 00:26:54,365
Speaker 7:  I got a press release in my inbox and I was so annoyed

463
00:26:54,475 --> 00:26:58,005
Speaker 7:  immediately with phone toaster. I was like, I don't wanna

464
00:26:58,275 --> 00:27:02,205
Speaker 7:  hear about this. And then we got here and I was like, well, I I

465
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:03,525
Speaker 7:  should go see the phone toaster.

466
00:27:04,185 --> 00:27:05,565
Speaker 3:  Is it actually called the Phone Toaster?

467
00:27:05,705 --> 00:27:09,445
Speaker 7:  No. Okay. That's, I told, I called it that once in my head and then it was

468
00:27:09,445 --> 00:27:10,685
Speaker 7:  just phone toaster after that.

469
00:27:12,395 --> 00:27:16,285
Speaker 7:  It's what it is, is the whole thing is called sw. It, it's

470
00:27:16,365 --> 00:27:17,285
Speaker 7:  a, it's called

471
00:27:17,465 --> 00:27:17,845
Speaker 3:  Sw It

472
00:27:18,785 --> 00:27:20,405
Speaker 7:  Sw it like sw it.

473
00:27:20,475 --> 00:27:22,645
Speaker 3:  They had phone toaster in their back pocket and they went with whip it.

474
00:27:24,005 --> 00:27:26,885
Speaker 7:  I know. I, you know. All right. They went with Whip It.

475
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:31,525
Speaker 7:  It's a, it's like a charging system for your phone

476
00:27:32,455 --> 00:27:36,125
Speaker 7:  where you have the phone case, there's a battery

477
00:27:36,835 --> 00:27:40,645
Speaker 7:  pack in it and you use it like you would

478
00:27:40,765 --> 00:27:44,605
Speaker 7:  a phone with a case and a battery and when it's time to charge you

479
00:27:44,695 --> 00:27:48,645
Speaker 7:  stick it in the phone toaster and it goes and it swaps

480
00:27:48,645 --> 00:27:52,245
Speaker 7:  out the battery and you take it out, you're good to go two seconds.

481
00:27:52,865 --> 00:27:56,565
Speaker 7:  And I was like, I'm still kind of like not understanding this.

482
00:27:57,745 --> 00:28:01,565
Speaker 7:  And they're like, well you just, you never charge your phone again. You just

483
00:28:02,135 --> 00:28:04,445
Speaker 4:  Sweep it. The truth is you perfectly understand it.

484
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:07,085
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Don't you need, how much does it cost?

485
00:28:07,955 --> 00:28:09,925
Speaker 7:  Okay. So that's the thing.

486
00:28:10,885 --> 00:28:12,005
Speaker 3:  I don't, that's not a good, okay.

487
00:28:12,785 --> 00:28:16,725
Speaker 7:  The phone toaster itself, the hub is for the

488
00:28:16,725 --> 00:28:20,645
Speaker 7:  Hub. Hub. It's the hub. Okay. The phone cases are the link.

489
00:28:21,235 --> 00:28:25,045
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Phone toaster is $450. Sure.

490
00:28:25,045 --> 00:28:28,485
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Yeah. And the phone case is $120.

491
00:28:29,025 --> 00:28:30,085
Speaker 3:  It doesn't come with a case.

492
00:28:30,485 --> 00:28:32,405
Speaker 7:  Do you have to buy because you have to buy the one for, can you

493
00:28:32,405 --> 00:28:36,335
Speaker 4:  Get the case without getting the toaster? You could, but why would you,

494
00:28:36,395 --> 00:28:36,895
Speaker 4:  why would you?

495
00:28:36,895 --> 00:28:38,375
Speaker 7:  Okay. That's fair. You need the toaster

496
00:28:38,555 --> 00:28:41,735
Speaker 3:  And you need multiple Does how many batteries are in each toaster?

497
00:28:42,175 --> 00:28:44,255
Speaker 7:  There's five batteries in the toaster.

498
00:28:45,235 --> 00:28:47,815
Speaker 4:  Do you ever say sentences and be like, how did we get here? I

499
00:28:48,835 --> 00:28:50,175
Speaker 7:  I'm like, this is what I'm paid to do

500
00:28:51,915 --> 00:28:55,055
Speaker 3:  And just correct me. So you would need like two, you need like one at home

501
00:28:55,055 --> 00:28:57,895
Speaker 3:  and one in your office or something. That's right. So you're like a thousand

502
00:28:57,895 --> 00:28:58,815
Speaker 3:  dollars deep into felt

503
00:28:58,815 --> 00:29:02,495
Speaker 7:  Toaster. Yeah. You gotta invest a thousand dollars in your toasters and,

504
00:29:02,555 --> 00:29:04,655
Speaker 7:  and then you never have to charge your phone again.

505
00:29:06,155 --> 00:29:08,675
Speaker 3:  I feel like I can never charge my phone again for a thousand dollars in a

506
00:29:08,675 --> 00:29:09,515
Speaker 3:  variety of different ways.

507
00:29:10,675 --> 00:29:14,115
Speaker 7:  I know you could have chargers like in every corner of your house. I just

508
00:29:14,115 --> 00:29:16,195
Speaker 7:  think like, there's something I appreciate where I

509
00:29:16,195 --> 00:29:16,835
Speaker 3:  Feel like we have two phones.

510
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:18,535
Speaker 7:  You could have a lot of phones.

511
00:29:18,725 --> 00:29:22,655
Speaker 4:  Just, I'm sorry. Are you, are you telling me you don't find the idea of being

512
00:29:22,655 --> 00:29:26,135
Speaker 4:  able to just like walk into your like

513
00:29:26,315 --> 00:29:29,455
Speaker 4:  living room when you get home and just go like, and your phone is magically

514
00:29:29,455 --> 00:29:32,415
Speaker 4:  charged again? Yeah. That kicks ass. That's it. You know what it's, it makes

515
00:29:32,415 --> 00:29:36,335
Speaker 4:  me think of like in in action movies when the guy can do like a

516
00:29:36,335 --> 00:29:40,095
Speaker 4:  really cool like hot swap of of magazines of ammo

517
00:29:40,235 --> 00:29:43,125
Speaker 4:  and it's like they like flip their guns around. That's us. That's what we

518
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:44,845
Speaker 4:  get now. Yeah. With the phone toaster

519
00:29:44,945 --> 00:29:46,245
Speaker 7:  For $450.

520
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:46,605
Speaker 4:  This is a

521
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:48,245
Speaker 3:  For one homie. It's called the sw. It

522
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:54,125
Speaker 4:  Just again, hand by consult. I will tell you it should have been the phone

523
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:54,325
Speaker 4:  toaster.

524
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:55,645
Speaker 7:  It's a phone toaster. Yeah.

525
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:57,005
Speaker 4:  I'm saying

526
00:29:57,435 --> 00:30:00,605
Speaker 3:  This says, remind me that when I got my first Sony, it had the little flip

527
00:30:00,605 --> 00:30:03,285
Speaker 3:  down microphone. I did practice trying to make that a cool move

528
00:30:04,985 --> 00:30:08,885
Speaker 3:  was not successful and remained single throughout high school. Carry on.

529
00:30:09,555 --> 00:30:11,965
Speaker 4:  What else have you seen? That's cool. You've been, you've been running around.

530
00:30:12,205 --> 00:30:14,325
Speaker 4:  I have seeing all kinds of stuff. So I feel like you've had less of a like

531
00:30:15,035 --> 00:30:18,685
Speaker 4:  focused goal at CES and you're more just like, what weird things can I

532
00:30:18,685 --> 00:30:20,765
Speaker 4:  encounter? Yeah. I, which is the correct way to do CES?

533
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:24,725
Speaker 7:  I have the best job and it's, I've never had this job at CES before.

534
00:30:24,725 --> 00:30:28,365
Speaker 7:  This is my sixth CES. Yeah,

535
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:29,365
Speaker 7:  because

536
00:30:29,365 --> 00:30:32,285
Speaker 4:  You spent a lot of your time not at CES with phones and there are just no

537
00:30:32,285 --> 00:30:33,045
Speaker 4:  phones here. Yeah, yeah.

538
00:30:33,105 --> 00:30:33,965
Speaker 7:  No phones. Just not a

539
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:34,485
Speaker 4:  Phone show. I

540
00:30:34,725 --> 00:30:38,645
Speaker 7:  Reviewed the one plus 13. It's awesome. And then I just left it

541
00:30:38,645 --> 00:30:42,445
Speaker 7:  in my hotel room and I went into the show floor. No it, it rules

542
00:30:42,885 --> 00:30:46,765
Speaker 7:  'cause like I've had the CS experience where you run from meeting to

543
00:30:46,765 --> 00:30:50,725
Speaker 7:  meeting and you're like sweating and you're talking to people and you don't

544
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:53,925
Speaker 7:  get to see anything. So this year I got to see things

545
00:30:54,665 --> 00:30:58,525
Speaker 7:  and I wandered through the west hall. I was like,

546
00:30:58,585 --> 00:31:02,245
Speaker 7:  I'm just going to like see what's here and get out real quick. Like an hour

547
00:31:02,245 --> 00:31:06,085
Speaker 7:  and a half later I was like taking pictures of myself with every like massive

548
00:31:06,395 --> 00:31:10,325
Speaker 7:  tractor I could find. I was like, this is the coolest thing. There's like

549
00:31:10,955 --> 00:31:14,405
Speaker 7:  massive, you know, electric vehicles and

550
00:31:15,005 --> 00:31:18,445
Speaker 7:  I was like, oh I got, I gotta move on. Like I can't spend

551
00:31:18,445 --> 00:31:22,045
Speaker 3:  My, can you do the demo? I think it's, caterpillar has a great demo where

552
00:31:22,045 --> 00:31:25,445
Speaker 3:  you can sit in a cockpit and remote operate a digger that's like hundreds

553
00:31:25,445 --> 00:31:28,805
Speaker 3:  of miles away. Oh no. What? And there's just a line I got and it's like they

554
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:31,205
Speaker 3:  have a drone. Is it over five? Looking at the digger. You do the digger

555
00:31:31,505 --> 00:31:32,165
Speaker 7:  On a or

556
00:31:32,285 --> 00:31:36,125
Speaker 3:  5G. Yes. It's all 5G. Finally the promise of 5G is been

557
00:31:36,285 --> 00:31:39,805
Speaker 3:  realized and it's three guys standing in line to operate a digger 500 miles

558
00:31:39,805 --> 00:31:40,485
Speaker 3:  away. I knew

559
00:31:40,485 --> 00:31:40,605
Speaker 7:  It.

560
00:31:43,425 --> 00:31:45,525
Speaker 3:  It all happened. We've run the race, we did

561
00:31:45,525 --> 00:31:45,645
Speaker 4:  It

562
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:46,725
Speaker 3:  F China

563
00:31:47,665 --> 00:31:48,085
Speaker 7:  Remote

564
00:31:48,085 --> 00:31:52,005
Speaker 3:  Control digger. There's a long line of people who just like sat in this

565
00:31:52,005 --> 00:31:55,685
Speaker 3:  thing and they like scooped up some dirt and they put the dirt away and it's

566
00:31:55,685 --> 00:31:58,485
Speaker 3:  like they're watching it on a TV and it's like, oh man, this isn't actually

567
00:31:58,485 --> 00:31:58,765
Speaker 3:  cool.

568
00:31:59,185 --> 00:32:00,525
Speaker 7:  That's what I'm gonna do tomorrow.

569
00:32:01,425 --> 00:32:04,965
Speaker 3:  You should go back tomorrow. Yeah. But it was very fun. One guy ran into

570
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:08,685
Speaker 3:  like, he couldn't do it and the guy's like, let me find you some looser soil.

571
00:32:08,785 --> 00:32:10,485
Speaker 3:  And I was like, that is the harshest

572
00:32:10,515 --> 00:32:10,805
Speaker 4:  Term

573
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:14,365
Speaker 7:  I've ever, alright, well now I'm nervous.

574
00:32:15,345 --> 00:32:18,765
Speaker 4:  Let me find interesting looser soil as a motivational poster that I would

575
00:32:18,765 --> 00:32:19,525
Speaker 4:  like to exist. Yeah.

576
00:32:19,585 --> 00:32:20,325
Speaker 7:  People, no,

577
00:32:20,765 --> 00:32:21,045
Speaker 3:  It's

578
00:32:21,045 --> 00:32:23,925
Speaker 4:  Rough. When life gets hard fund looser soil, it like that leaves something

579
00:32:23,925 --> 00:32:25,085
Speaker 4:  to me that's

580
00:32:25,085 --> 00:32:25,765
Speaker 7:  Like, that's

581
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:26,245
Speaker 4:  Powerful.

582
00:32:26,925 --> 00:32:30,605
Speaker 3:  Have you seen in Central Hall next to the Samsung

583
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:34,365
Speaker 3:  booth, there's a little booth for just an LED manufacturer.

584
00:32:35,195 --> 00:32:38,965
Speaker 3:  Like they don't make the displays really? They make the LED componentry

585
00:32:39,045 --> 00:32:42,205
Speaker 3:  and they're very proud of, apparently they've invented a million things first.

586
00:32:42,315 --> 00:32:46,285
Speaker 3:  Like the first wire free LED circuitry that can do a thing like all

587
00:32:46,285 --> 00:32:50,165
Speaker 3:  this stuff, the first heat resistant whatever. But their tagline,

588
00:32:50,925 --> 00:32:54,885
Speaker 3:  I swear to you, this is the tagline of this company, birth is not fair,

589
00:32:55,185 --> 00:32:58,845
Speaker 3:  but opportunity must be fair. And it's like in

590
00:32:59,075 --> 00:33:02,765
Speaker 3:  huge letters. And then right below it, it's like the future of

591
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:04,725
Speaker 3:  ole signage. And I'm like,

592
00:33:05,585 --> 00:33:05,805
Speaker 7:  Wow.

593
00:33:06,155 --> 00:33:09,685
Speaker 3:  Like stick to your guns. Like I go for it. Like shout it from the

594
00:33:09,685 --> 00:33:13,605
Speaker 3:  rooftops opportunity. Must be fair. It's like right next to

595
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:16,405
Speaker 3:  the Samsung booth. So all these people are walking by it and like taking

596
00:33:16,405 --> 00:33:19,725
Speaker 3:  selfies with it. 'cause it's so weird. And I think it's working, like, I

597
00:33:19,725 --> 00:33:23,005
Speaker 3:  think a lot of people are being radicalized into like an inherently progressive

598
00:33:23,005 --> 00:33:25,525
Speaker 3:  agenda, but it's ole manufacturer,

599
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:29,445
Speaker 7:  They wanted to see the frame pro. That's what they,

600
00:33:29,795 --> 00:33:31,925
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I feel like that's where your opportunity is to go over and be like,

601
00:33:32,085 --> 00:33:35,565
Speaker 4:  actually Ed isn't really massively available yet. It's it's still too expensive

602
00:33:35,945 --> 00:33:37,445
Speaker 4:  if you couldn just work on OLED becoming

603
00:33:37,455 --> 00:33:40,005
Speaker 3:  Commercial. Not fair. Find looser soil,

604
00:33:40,755 --> 00:33:41,045
Speaker 7:  Find

605
00:33:41,325 --> 00:33:43,005
Speaker 3:  Looser. What else have you seen that's scrap?

606
00:33:44,945 --> 00:33:48,925
Speaker 7:  So I, I got to wander around the central hall. I, So

607
00:33:48,925 --> 00:33:52,165
Speaker 7:  I used to cover cameras fulltime, I stopped by Nikon

608
00:33:53,105 --> 00:33:56,965
Speaker 7:  and you might be bummed to hear that there are like zero cameras.

609
00:33:57,265 --> 00:34:01,165
Speaker 7:  Oh man. At the Nikon booth. I was scandalized. There's like

610
00:34:02,005 --> 00:34:05,725
Speaker 7:  airplanes and then someone like doing a fake weather forecast for some reason.

611
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:10,685
Speaker 7:  But I I found Nikon. Yeah. I was like, sure,

612
00:34:11,745 --> 00:34:15,445
Speaker 7:  but there's a camera they're gonna take to the moon and it has a little jacket

613
00:34:15,665 --> 00:34:18,245
Speaker 7:  on. I thought that was so sweet. Yeah.

614
00:34:18,485 --> 00:34:18,765
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

615
00:34:18,945 --> 00:34:20,525
Speaker 4:  You got really excited about the jacket. I

616
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:24,165
Speaker 7:  Did. Yeah. I came back like three times and I was like, I wanna make sure

617
00:34:24,165 --> 00:34:28,125
Speaker 7:  I get all the facts right about the, the moon camera. Now I got

618
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:31,925
Speaker 7:  to just like see the show from the perspective of

619
00:34:31,925 --> 00:34:35,765
Speaker 7:  someone who's just like, wants to go see cool shit. The

620
00:34:36,045 --> 00:34:39,765
Speaker 7:  LG booth is awesome. They do the, there's a whole thing with the

621
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:43,925
Speaker 7:  translucent TV panels where like, you know, you

622
00:34:43,925 --> 00:34:47,645
Speaker 7:  stand around, you watch it and it's like jellyfish and then it morphs into

623
00:34:47,645 --> 00:34:51,445
Speaker 7:  other stuff and then they, all the panels kind of come out and

624
00:34:51,445 --> 00:34:55,405
Speaker 7:  it's stained glass and it looks like Jesus is about

625
00:34:55,425 --> 00:34:59,325
Speaker 7:  to like emerge from the TVs. Right. I was like, this

626
00:34:59,345 --> 00:35:02,365
Speaker 7:  is a spiritual experience right here for some people.

627
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:07,165
Speaker 7:  But yeah, like I just, I got to check out Eureka Park. I got to,

628
00:35:08,085 --> 00:35:08,885
Speaker 7:  I went to the Spear.

629
00:35:09,905 --> 00:35:10,445
Speaker 3:  Oh, for the Delta

630
00:35:10,505 --> 00:35:14,205
Speaker 7:  Two? Yeah. Yeah. I went for that. I was never been there before.

631
00:35:15,045 --> 00:35:18,925
Speaker 7:  I wasn't prepared for the Smellovision like portion of

632
00:35:18,925 --> 00:35:22,885
Speaker 7:  it. They did a thing with Uber Eats where it was like

633
00:35:22,925 --> 00:35:26,805
Speaker 7:  a bit, there was a guy on like a moped like delivering

634
00:35:26,805 --> 00:35:30,645
Speaker 7:  Uber Eats and then they like pump in this smell of

635
00:35:30,645 --> 00:35:34,525
Speaker 7:  like hazelnut and everybody's kinda like, do you smell that?

636
00:35:34,755 --> 00:35:38,645
Speaker 7:  It's kind of sweet. And then they were like, oh, a hazelnut

637
00:35:38,645 --> 00:35:41,125
Speaker 7:  coffee. Just how I like, I was like,

638
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:41,685
Speaker 4:  That's a lot.

639
00:35:41,985 --> 00:35:42,765
Speaker 7:  It, it was

640
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:46,005
Speaker 3:  A lot. One thing that I've been dying to ask you about is the TCL l Next

641
00:35:46,005 --> 00:35:49,965
Speaker 3:  paper phone. Yeah. I dunno if you've seen it. As you

642
00:35:49,965 --> 00:35:53,845
Speaker 3:  know, David is the number one retail agent for the books Palmer here in America.

643
00:35:54,615 --> 00:35:58,525
Speaker 3:  Which by the way, it currently is in some sort of weird Chinese AI

644
00:35:58,525 --> 00:36:00,845
Speaker 3:  data privacy scandal. So well done. David, thank

645
00:36:00,845 --> 00:36:00,925
Speaker 4:  You

646
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:05,005
Speaker 3:  For way to do an op on the people of America with your weird ePaper phone.

647
00:36:05,885 --> 00:36:08,925
Speaker 4:  I believe I advocated for mostly using that thing in airplane mode. So I'm

648
00:36:08,925 --> 00:36:10,525
Speaker 4:  good. I feel fine about this.

649
00:36:11,145 --> 00:36:14,965
Speaker 3:  So we, we, we've just seen a lot of interest in these like

650
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:18,885
Speaker 3:  minimal phones and it is a secondary device, right? Like, I don't, it

651
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,565
Speaker 3:  doesn't make any sense to me to have a e ink phone as your primary device.

652
00:36:21,905 --> 00:36:25,085
Speaker 3:  And so TCL this is like their second or third next paper phone

653
00:36:25,885 --> 00:36:29,405
Speaker 3:  and they're, they, they have Matt displays and then you can switch 'em to

654
00:36:29,405 --> 00:36:33,005
Speaker 3:  black and white mode. But this year they look almost like E Inc.

655
00:36:33,435 --> 00:36:37,365
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Yeah. They've been doing this next paper thing and it like was in

656
00:36:37,365 --> 00:36:41,045
Speaker 7:  the tablets first and then they brought it to the phones. And the

657
00:36:41,225 --> 00:36:44,885
Speaker 7:  the thing that I'm most excited about, and I think you are too,

658
00:36:45,185 --> 00:36:49,045
Speaker 7:  is the next paper key, which is just a little slider button on

659
00:36:49,045 --> 00:36:52,685
Speaker 7:  the side of the phone that puts it into Max Ink

660
00:36:52,755 --> 00:36:54,885
Speaker 7:  mode. And that just, that's

661
00:36:54,885 --> 00:36:55,685
Speaker 3:  Where it looks the most like

662
00:36:55,905 --> 00:36:59,685
Speaker 7:  Ink mode. Yeah. Yeah. That's the like ein mode and it's like Mono

663
00:36:59,815 --> 00:37:00,165
Speaker 7:  David

664
00:37:00,165 --> 00:37:02,885
Speaker 4:  Consultancy approves of that. Yeah. On

665
00:37:02,885 --> 00:37:06,805
Speaker 7:  Max you just like, pretend your phone is an ein phone for a minute and it's

666
00:37:06,805 --> 00:37:07,445
Speaker 7:  like, does it

667
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,885
Speaker 4:  Work? Like I feel like we, we've seen a lot of companies do this thing where

668
00:37:10,885 --> 00:37:14,285
Speaker 4:  they're like, it's an LCD but it's a, it's a better one to look at. What

669
00:37:14,285 --> 00:37:15,645
Speaker 3:  Netflix, what was the little startup just now?

670
00:37:15,825 --> 00:37:16,325
Speaker 4:  The daylight.

671
00:37:16,545 --> 00:37:20,125
Speaker 3:  The daylight. And they were all in. They were like, this will save you.

672
00:37:20,275 --> 00:37:22,565
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And it it, it was one of those, like, it had some interesting ideas,

673
00:37:22,585 --> 00:37:26,525
Speaker 4:  but it is a little bit like the, a sort of jack of all trades and master

674
00:37:26,525 --> 00:37:29,485
Speaker 4:  of None thing where it's like, it, it almost accomplishes all of its goals

675
00:37:29,485 --> 00:37:32,045
Speaker 4:  but it actually accomplishes none of them. And I feel like this has been

676
00:37:32,045 --> 00:37:34,445
Speaker 4:  true with a lot of these things, which is why I end up going back to E Inc.

677
00:37:34,445 --> 00:37:38,365
Speaker 4:  Because it's like Sure. It's slow refresh rate and it's, it doesn't work

678
00:37:38,455 --> 00:37:41,445
Speaker 4:  super well in certain conditions, but like it does the thing it's supposed

679
00:37:41,445 --> 00:37:45,165
Speaker 4:  to do. Which is not blare light in your eyes all the time. This does next

680
00:37:45,165 --> 00:37:47,125
Speaker 4:  paper. Like can it do the middle thing

681
00:37:47,555 --> 00:37:51,405
Speaker 7:  Kind of. Okay. I mean there's like, they have a matte kind of

682
00:37:51,405 --> 00:37:55,205
Speaker 7:  finish on the screen and they, they say all this stuff about,

683
00:37:55,515 --> 00:37:59,405
Speaker 7:  it's like, you know, rated to be really easy on your eyes and the

684
00:37:59,405 --> 00:38:02,845
Speaker 7:  blue light and the, all that. But like, really it's just,

685
00:38:03,145 --> 00:38:05,525
Speaker 3:  But really the thing that happens is you flip the switch on the side of the

686
00:38:05,525 --> 00:38:09,365
Speaker 3:  screen and like smoke comes out from the middle of the screen. Like

687
00:38:09,365 --> 00:38:13,165
Speaker 3:  there's an animation that's like ein is eating your display from the inside

688
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:17,005
Speaker 3:  out. It's very sci-fi and then it like takes over,

689
00:38:17,065 --> 00:38:20,325
Speaker 3:  it shuts down the screen and comes back as an e ink screen also for some

690
00:38:20,555 --> 00:38:23,765
Speaker 3:  extremely convoluted reason it quits all of your apps. Yeah.

691
00:38:24,545 --> 00:38:25,885
Speaker 3:  So it's not great in that

692
00:38:25,885 --> 00:38:29,565
Speaker 4:  Sense. I I literally believed you when you said smoke comes out. Like I was

693
00:38:29,805 --> 00:38:32,165
Speaker 4:  honestly like That makes sense. Yeah. TCO made a phone, you hit

694
00:38:32,165 --> 00:38:35,765
Speaker 3:  Explodes and you're left with a Kindle. Yeah. Pre prestige. When when you

695
00:38:35,765 --> 00:38:39,645
Speaker 3:  flip it back like a, like a purpley smoke emerges from the middle

696
00:38:39,645 --> 00:38:40,085
Speaker 3:  of the screen.

697
00:38:40,115 --> 00:38:41,565
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It's like a ripple. It's,

698
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:45,445
Speaker 3:  And there's a middle one, which is like a desaturated color e ink. And it's

699
00:38:45,445 --> 00:38:49,165
Speaker 3:  just like the thing, like I watched people cruise by all kinds of dumb AI

700
00:38:49,165 --> 00:38:53,005
Speaker 3:  ideas all day today and everyone stopped at the next paper booth.

701
00:38:53,485 --> 00:38:56,085
Speaker 3:  'cause the idea that you have a phone where you're reading it looks more

702
00:38:56,085 --> 00:38:59,845
Speaker 3:  like paper is inherently very compelling. And to me it's like,

703
00:38:59,865 --> 00:39:03,005
Speaker 3:  oh, maybe that's like the most interesting phone we're gonna see for a while.

704
00:39:03,605 --> 00:39:05,845
Speaker 3:  'cause it's, it's not like AI is gonna do any

705
00:39:06,245 --> 00:39:06,765
Speaker 7:  I know. Yeah.

706
00:39:07,385 --> 00:39:10,725
Speaker 4:  All right Allison, before we ruthlessly kick you off the stage. Okay. We

707
00:39:10,725 --> 00:39:14,165
Speaker 4:  have to talk about the thing that you and I both got. Yeah. I would say unnecessarily

708
00:39:14,165 --> 00:39:16,045
Speaker 4:  excited about at CES unveiled. Yeah.

709
00:39:16,165 --> 00:39:16,925
Speaker 7:  I scooped you.

710
00:39:17,225 --> 00:39:20,565
Speaker 4:  You did. It was honestly, we have a slack room where we were talking about

711
00:39:20,565 --> 00:39:22,605
Speaker 4:  the stuff we were gonna write about and I was like, I'm doing this now. Alison

712
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:24,925
Speaker 4:  was like, I did it already. It is the meanest thing that's ever happened

713
00:39:24,925 --> 00:39:28,725
Speaker 4:  to me. It's a a top fear water bottle. What's the whole thing? Explain

714
00:39:28,725 --> 00:39:31,525
Speaker 4:  this to the people. It is, who should all buy this thing immediately?

715
00:39:32,035 --> 00:39:36,005
Speaker 7:  Soda Stream. But for Hydro flask, like, that's it. It's

716
00:39:36,005 --> 00:39:39,445
Speaker 7:  a little top. You screw onto the top of your water bottle.

717
00:39:40,265 --> 00:39:44,085
Speaker 7:  You put the CO2 canister in and there there's like a little plastic lid

718
00:39:44,105 --> 00:39:48,085
Speaker 7:  you put on top and it does the put carbonation thing. And then

719
00:39:48,425 --> 00:39:52,005
Speaker 7:  you have sparkling water and you can be free and walk with it.

720
00:39:52,885 --> 00:39:53,005
Speaker 7:  I,

721
00:39:53,115 --> 00:39:55,445
Speaker 4:  It's honestly, it's all I've ever wanted. I don't know why I got so excited

722
00:39:55,445 --> 00:39:58,085
Speaker 4:  about this. But the idea of like, and they make a like specific water bottle.

723
00:39:58,085 --> 00:40:00,965
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And they're like, you can have your still water bottle and your sparkling

724
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:03,325
Speaker 4:  water bottle. Yeah. Which is like drop the little capsule in and it's, oh,

725
00:40:03,325 --> 00:40:03,605
Speaker 7:  I want,

726
00:40:04,425 --> 00:40:06,605
Speaker 3:  How many uses do you get outta each capsule? This

727
00:40:06,605 --> 00:40:07,005
Speaker 7:  Is who can,

728
00:40:07,335 --> 00:40:09,325
Speaker 4:  Don't don't ask questions. Don't worry about it. You can

729
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:10,365
Speaker 7:  Feel it's good.

730
00:40:10,795 --> 00:40:11,565
Speaker 3:  $5,000

731
00:40:11,975 --> 00:40:13,245
Speaker 4:  Water bottle. You never charge your

732
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:14,725
Speaker 3:  Phone a subscription. It's tracking

733
00:40:14,725 --> 00:40:17,485
Speaker 7:  You. Yes. And you have sparkling water for the rest of

734
00:40:17,485 --> 00:40:19,645
Speaker 3:  Your life. It's important. You know, sparkling water is freely available.

735
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:21,685
Speaker 3:  Okay. Point that out.

736
00:40:21,825 --> 00:40:24,005
Speaker 4:  And we don't all have that LaCroix money. Be like, yeah.

737
00:40:25,515 --> 00:40:25,805
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

738
00:40:26,865 --> 00:40:29,965
Speaker 4:  All right Allison, thank you. You're gonna come back when we do some q and

739
00:40:29,965 --> 00:40:32,765
Speaker 4:  a stuff, but for now go away. Okay. Yeah. We have to move on.

740
00:40:34,055 --> 00:40:35,045
Speaker 4:  Thank you. Yeah. Allison,

741
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:39,285
Speaker 4:  Jen Tuy, come hang out with us. Let's talk smart home things.

742
00:40:41,145 --> 00:40:44,005
Speaker 4:  Jen Tuy. Everybody should know this. All of our team is wonderful, but no

743
00:40:44,005 --> 00:40:47,725
Speaker 4:  one at CES is a celebrity. Quite like Gen Tuy is a

744
00:40:47,725 --> 00:40:51,645
Speaker 4:  celebrity. Yeah. Anyone who makes a smart home, anything which

745
00:40:51,645 --> 00:40:55,485
Speaker 4:  is everyone at CES is like largely obsessed with Gen

746
00:40:55,605 --> 00:40:56,405
Speaker 4:  Tuy. Yeah.

747
00:40:56,555 --> 00:40:57,045
Speaker 3:  Welcome.

748
00:40:57,295 --> 00:40:57,725
Speaker 4:  We're very

749
00:40:57,725 --> 00:41:01,645
Speaker 8:  Excited you're here. I, I was with Owen our a geographer today and I

750
00:41:01,645 --> 00:41:04,925
Speaker 8:  had quite a few people. In fact, I see some in the audience who are Yeah.

751
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:09,445
Speaker 8:  Come up to me and was like, said how wonderful they love The Verge, but that

752
00:41:09,465 --> 00:41:13,405
Speaker 8:  I'm their favorite. So yeah. A few also said they

753
00:41:13,405 --> 00:41:14,125
Speaker 8:  were gonna subscribe.

754
00:41:14,425 --> 00:41:18,405
Speaker 3:  Hey, there you go. That's what we have a subscription fee, but

755
00:41:18,405 --> 00:41:19,165
Speaker 3:  you get sparkling water.

756
00:41:20,225 --> 00:41:23,205
Speaker 4:  Can we talk about robot vacuums? All I want to talk about in the whole world

757
00:41:23,205 --> 00:41:26,405
Speaker 4:  is robot vacuums. I I have become

758
00:41:26,575 --> 00:41:30,445
Speaker 4:  completely sold on all weird robot vacuums

759
00:41:30,445 --> 00:41:31,845
Speaker 4:  ideas this week. That's

760
00:41:31,845 --> 00:41:32,565
Speaker 8:  Good. 'cause there are a lot of them.

761
00:41:32,635 --> 00:41:36,525
Speaker 4:  There's so many of them. I just wanna, I I want you to explain

762
00:41:36,525 --> 00:41:39,045
Speaker 4:  the ones that you've seen and liked the best. But the one that I got to see

763
00:41:39,045 --> 00:41:42,685
Speaker 4:  that is my favorite was there's a robo rock one

764
00:41:42,955 --> 00:41:46,925
Speaker 4:  that is just, it's, it's just a roomba looking thing, but it has

765
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:50,405
Speaker 4:  a robotic arm that comes out. I mean, so slowly,

766
00:41:50,985 --> 00:41:54,925
Speaker 4:  so slowly it just, it slowly comes out and it kind of goes like

767
00:41:54,925 --> 00:41:58,725
Speaker 4:  this. And then if it like sees a sock next to it, it just sort of gently

768
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:02,405
Speaker 4:  reaches over and picks up the sock and then just moves with it somewhere

769
00:42:02,725 --> 00:42:06,165
Speaker 4:  and then just puts the sock down in a different place. Correct. And there

770
00:42:06,165 --> 00:42:10,005
Speaker 4:  was a person at the Robo Rocks booth whose job was to

771
00:42:10,085 --> 00:42:12,565
Speaker 4:  reach over and put the sock back in the vacuum's way.

772
00:42:13,745 --> 00:42:13,965
Speaker 8:  And

773
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:17,685
Speaker 4:  It was the be i, I stood there for like much too long watching this person

774
00:42:17,685 --> 00:42:21,485
Speaker 4:  just slowly fight with the vacuum about where the sock should go. And I enjoyed

775
00:42:21,485 --> 00:42:22,605
Speaker 8:  It very much. Did you see them doing their dance?

776
00:42:23,305 --> 00:42:25,365
Speaker 4:  No. There's a dance they had, they

777
00:42:25,365 --> 00:42:29,355
Speaker 8:  Had a whole row of them stacked right the front of the booth and

778
00:42:29,355 --> 00:42:33,155
Speaker 8:  they had them dancing and sink the arms. Incredible. I know. It was, it was

779
00:42:33,155 --> 00:42:33,395
Speaker 8:  pretty good.

780
00:42:33,535 --> 00:42:37,475
Speaker 3:  Can I just say, I'm, and everyone wants to talk about humanoid robots. I'm

781
00:42:37,475 --> 00:42:40,235
Speaker 3:  afraid of the vacuums that have limbs.

782
00:42:40,915 --> 00:42:41,275
Speaker 8:  They're,

783
00:42:41,295 --> 00:42:45,035
Speaker 3:  But before we got on stage, Jen was like, one of them has legs. That's just

784
00:42:45,115 --> 00:42:48,075
Speaker 3:  a thing. She casually said, I I'm gonna find out more

785
00:42:48,075 --> 00:42:51,915
Speaker 8:  Soon. Legs and arm. That was, that was the, you know, we, it, they

786
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:55,195
Speaker 8:  elevated throughout the week. So it started and we actually got to see the

787
00:42:55,265 --> 00:42:59,075
Speaker 8:  robo rock a sneak peak last month. So we were, we were

788
00:42:59,175 --> 00:43:02,875
Speaker 8:  all prepped for the arms. And in fact when we were all prepped for the arm,

789
00:43:03,095 --> 00:43:06,875
Speaker 8:  the uprising, the robot uprising was coming. And then

790
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:10,995
Speaker 8:  the other Rob, so there are lots of competitors in the robo rock, robo

791
00:43:11,075 --> 00:43:14,235
Speaker 8:  vac space and Robo Rock came out with the arm and then

792
00:43:14,655 --> 00:43:18,555
Speaker 8:  dreamy came out with the legs. And then that was

793
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:20,635
Speaker 8:  their debut. And these are, these are robots that are coming, you're gonna

794
00:43:20,635 --> 00:43:22,835
Speaker 8:  be able to buy. And they're like, the next couple of months, these aren't

795
00:43:22,835 --> 00:43:26,155
Speaker 8:  concept vacuums. And then I went to the dreamy booth and they're like, oh,

796
00:43:26,155 --> 00:43:29,435
Speaker 8:  but now we have one that has legs and an arm.

797
00:43:30,855 --> 00:43:33,955
Speaker 8:  So this is, and that they said, actually that'll be out by the end of the

798
00:43:33,955 --> 00:43:34,075
Speaker 8:  year.

799
00:43:34,215 --> 00:43:35,115
Speaker 3:  How fast can it run?

800
00:43:36,215 --> 00:43:39,555
Speaker 8:  So this is, it's, the legs are a little, I mean it's,

801
00:43:40,265 --> 00:43:44,195
Speaker 8:  they just basically raise the robot up far enough so that it can

802
00:43:44,195 --> 00:43:48,035
Speaker 8:  kind of get over and transition. Like if you've ever had a robot vacuum that

803
00:43:48,035 --> 00:43:50,835
Speaker 8:  can't get into your bathroom, 'cause you've got like a high ledge and then

804
00:43:50,835 --> 00:43:53,915
Speaker 8:  it kind of, the legs kind of collapse from under it and it goes forward.

805
00:43:54,095 --> 00:43:56,795
Speaker 8:  So it's not like it's gonna climb up your staircase to the second floor.

806
00:43:57,015 --> 00:43:57,235
Speaker 8:  You

807
00:43:57,235 --> 00:44:00,075
Speaker 4:  Can almost like hear it go every time. It's

808
00:44:00,075 --> 00:44:00,155
Speaker 8:  Just

809
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:01,995
Speaker 4:  Like lunging over.

810
00:44:02,065 --> 00:44:05,235
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Well and when I was watching the one with the legs and the arm,

811
00:44:06,175 --> 00:44:08,275
Speaker 8:  he said, well, we kind of modeled it after a horse.

812
00:44:10,095 --> 00:44:13,715
Speaker 8:  And you can see the legs go up and then the arm goes up and it's like,

813
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:17,715
Speaker 3:  And this is, I wanna be clear, this is a vacuum cleaner.

814
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:23,515
Speaker 8:  So the idea is if anyone's ever used a robot vacuum, they often get stuck.

815
00:44:23,855 --> 00:44:26,755
Speaker 8:  Or if you've left your socks out, they'll suck up your socks. And then there's

816
00:44:26,935 --> 00:44:30,355
Speaker 8:  AI powered obstacle avoidance, which is supposed to help them get around

817
00:44:30,355 --> 00:44:32,780
Speaker 8:  the sock. But then, then they haven't cleaned the floor where the sock was.

818
00:44:33,065 --> 00:44:36,605
Speaker 8:  So this idea is it's gonna pick up your sock. You can tell it where to put

819
00:44:36,605 --> 00:44:40,485
Speaker 8:  it. And so it'll go put it in a basket or it,

820
00:44:40,545 --> 00:44:43,405
Speaker 8:  the dreamy one can pick up shoes so it can go put shoes.

821
00:44:43,435 --> 00:44:44,685
Speaker 3:  It's strong enough to pick up a shoe.

822
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:47,925
Speaker 4:  500 pounds. Yeah, we we're done for it. It's over now.

823
00:44:48,265 --> 00:44:50,525
Speaker 3:  It can hop like a horse and pick up shoes.

824
00:44:51,515 --> 00:44:51,805
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

825
00:44:52,205 --> 00:44:52,325
Speaker 3:  I

826
00:44:52,325 --> 00:44:55,205
Speaker 8:  Don't like this. And this one actually the dream, the new dreamy one can,

827
00:44:55,385 --> 00:44:57,585
Speaker 8:  can use tools. So

828
00:45:00,055 --> 00:45:02,145
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I actually don't like that. I changed my mind.

829
00:45:02,645 --> 00:45:04,425
Speaker 3:  I'm out. So they've all seen the movies, right?

830
00:45:04,775 --> 00:45:05,065
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

831
00:45:06,485 --> 00:45:10,425
Speaker 8:  But the ultimate idea is they'll clean everywhere. 'cause right now they

832
00:45:10,425 --> 00:45:14,225
Speaker 8:  are kind of spotty. Yeah. But it'll, and it, it can, it has this

833
00:45:14,225 --> 00:45:17,705
Speaker 8:  little arm kind of goes into a toolbox and takes a tool out. But yes, I could

834
00:45:17,705 --> 00:45:20,945
Speaker 8:  de I mean right now it's a soft brush. But you know, when it's like little

835
00:45:20,945 --> 00:45:21,305
Speaker 8:  chains,

836
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:24,345
Speaker 4:  There's a full like battle bot situation you're describing. Well,

837
00:45:24,345 --> 00:45:27,065
Speaker 8:  I kept saying, you know, could we put you're across the way from each other?

838
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:30,985
Speaker 8:  Can we just get the two robots together? Yeah. And go for it. But

839
00:45:31,085 --> 00:45:32,545
Speaker 8:  no, they weren't having any of them. Like,

840
00:45:32,685 --> 00:45:35,145
Speaker 3:  Are are, is there a list of acceptable tools?

841
00:45:36,015 --> 00:45:37,465
Speaker 8:  It's just little brushes. It's

842
00:45:37,465 --> 00:45:40,705
Speaker 3:  Like they're mostly brushes. Brushes because like you give this robot a hammer,

843
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:44,385
Speaker 3:  like all kinds of weird shit just checking. All right.

844
00:45:44,645 --> 00:45:47,545
Speaker 8:  But they're everywhere. Robots with arms, legs, all sorts of things.

845
00:45:47,685 --> 00:45:51,255
Speaker 3:  It does seem like in terms of just like household

846
00:45:51,435 --> 00:45:54,855
Speaker 3:  robots, it's the vacuums that people are like, these are the ones people

847
00:45:55,135 --> 00:45:58,535
Speaker 3:  actually buy and then everything else is kind of, and so there's just a tremendous

848
00:45:58,535 --> 00:46:00,655
Speaker 3:  amount of weird vacuum ideas.

849
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:05,095
Speaker 8:  It's where the innovation is definitely in the robot space because, and

850
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:08,495
Speaker 8:  I've talked about this before, you know the whole kind of dream is the rosy

851
00:46:08,495 --> 00:46:11,975
Speaker 8:  the robot, the human eye. But that's, you know what if and when that ever

852
00:46:11,975 --> 00:46:15,435
Speaker 8:  comes is gonna be, no one's be able to afford it

853
00:46:16,615 --> 00:46:20,115
Speaker 8:  and it's gonna be kind of scary. So for me the idea of like

854
00:46:20,265 --> 00:46:23,755
Speaker 8:  modular single purpose robots or

855
00:46:24,135 --> 00:46:27,755
Speaker 8:  robots that can do one or two tasks rather than

856
00:46:27,945 --> 00:46:31,795
Speaker 8:  like a big powerful humanoid robot roaming around

857
00:46:31,795 --> 00:46:35,635
Speaker 8:  your house makes a lot more sense. And in fact, switch bot who's kind of

858
00:46:35,635 --> 00:46:39,075
Speaker 8:  known for quite innovative, slightly janky products,

859
00:46:40,225 --> 00:46:44,115
Speaker 8:  came out with a modular robot platform. So the little,

860
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:47,475
Speaker 8:  it has a little robot with something that's called an fusion platform that

861
00:46:47,475 --> 00:46:51,115
Speaker 8:  goes on top. And then you can put different accessories and it will drive

862
00:46:51,115 --> 00:46:55,035
Speaker 8:  around your house and like bring you things. It has,

863
00:46:55,055 --> 00:46:58,115
Speaker 8:  you can put a fan on it so you can have it like come and keep you cool.

864
00:46:58,695 --> 00:47:01,435
Speaker 8:  Purify the air. So this is like, you know it's,

865
00:47:01,435 --> 00:47:04,435
Speaker 4:  Wait, you forgot the one where it'll do a Teles robot. Oh it's just a big,

866
00:47:04,535 --> 00:47:06,435
Speaker 4:  big ass selfie stick that you can stick big selfie stick, stick your phone

867
00:47:06,655 --> 00:47:08,355
Speaker 4:  and then it'll just wander around your house. Yes.

868
00:47:08,465 --> 00:47:09,595
Speaker 8:  That one sold. That would be

869
00:47:09,735 --> 00:47:11,315
Speaker 3:  All the way back to an iPad on

870
00:47:11,935 --> 00:47:12,435
Speaker 8:  A's what it is.

871
00:47:12,865 --> 00:47:14,875
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It also cleans your floors at the

872
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:15,115
Speaker 8:  Same time.

873
00:47:15,115 --> 00:47:17,835
Speaker 3:  Like 10 years ago I walked around CS and people were like, the future of

874
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:21,715
Speaker 3:  work is an iPad. On a segue, we actually, we have a

875
00:47:21,715 --> 00:47:25,595
Speaker 3:  great video from ageism. James Vincent just came to our

876
00:47:25,595 --> 00:47:29,445
Speaker 3:  office from his home in London as an iPod on

877
00:47:29,485 --> 00:47:33,405
Speaker 3:  a stick or an iPad on a stick. And his conclusion was like, no one respects

878
00:47:33,405 --> 00:47:33,565
Speaker 3:  me.

879
00:47:37,585 --> 00:47:40,965
Speaker 3:  You can see it's like it's hard. All right. I'm saying good luck to everyone.

880
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:42,885
Speaker 8:  I know the robots

881
00:47:43,035 --> 00:47:45,165
Speaker 4:  Have the idea of them though. Like the idea that you have this little tiny

882
00:47:45,165 --> 00:47:48,485
Speaker 4:  thing that a does a thing, it cleans your floors, but it also

883
00:47:48,485 --> 00:47:52,245
Speaker 4:  increasingly like understands and has mapped your house, knows how to move

884
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:54,165
Speaker 4:  around. The idea that there's more stuff you can do with

885
00:47:54,165 --> 00:47:55,645
Speaker 3:  That back. Can you tools and throw shoes?

886
00:47:55,755 --> 00:47:57,005
Speaker 4:  Yeah, that I'm less excited about

887
00:47:57,465 --> 00:47:57,965
Speaker 3:  The can.

888
00:47:57,965 --> 00:48:01,405
Speaker 4:  You can open a box and use tools could go sideways but

889
00:48:01,905 --> 00:48:04,685
Speaker 4:  air purifiers and selfie sticks, I mean yeah this

890
00:48:04,685 --> 00:48:08,165
Speaker 3:  Works. It's gonna roll up in like a puff of smoke is gonna come out and you're

891
00:48:08,165 --> 00:48:09,485
Speaker 3:  gonna fall to the ground. Yeah,

892
00:48:10,075 --> 00:48:10,365
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

893
00:48:10,635 --> 00:48:14,005
Speaker 3:  Wake up without a kidney. What is going on? Use tools.

894
00:48:15,515 --> 00:48:17,085
Speaker 3:  Yeah, think about it. I'm just saying

895
00:48:18,465 --> 00:48:21,005
Speaker 4:  I'm fine with this. It doesn't look like a person so it's less creepy.

896
00:48:22,155 --> 00:48:25,725
Speaker 8:  Well actually the switch bot is, they are working on an the switch bot just

897
00:48:25,725 --> 00:48:26,325
Speaker 8:  on a little face.

898
00:48:27,355 --> 00:48:31,285
Speaker 3:  Alright, speaking of horror, so let's talk about matter. There's a

899
00:48:31,285 --> 00:48:34,885
Speaker 3:  lot of matter stuff here. There is an entire door

900
00:48:35,035 --> 00:48:37,205
Speaker 3:  lock camera, biometric handle.

901
00:48:38,075 --> 00:48:40,285
Speaker 8:  It's the year of the door lock I called it. Yeah,

902
00:48:40,645 --> 00:48:44,445
Speaker 3:  Your most, the product you listed here is most likely to buy is the

903
00:48:44,445 --> 00:48:48,165
Speaker 3:  new schlag lock that has ultra wideband. Yes.

904
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:51,005
Speaker 3:  And I believe I was reading Jen's right up and it's like it calculates your

905
00:48:51,245 --> 00:48:55,125
Speaker 3:  velocity as you approach the door, which is just not a thing that you

906
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:56,445
Speaker 3:  think a door lock needs to do.

907
00:48:56,955 --> 00:49:00,245
Speaker 8:  Well so the idea is actually got a demo of it this evening. It they're not

908
00:49:00,245 --> 00:49:03,725
Speaker 8:  shown on the show floor. They did, that was all they released. But they did

909
00:49:03,725 --> 00:49:07,165
Speaker 8:  give me a little sneak peek just before I came here. And the idea of the

910
00:49:07,325 --> 00:49:11,085
Speaker 8:  velocity is If you are, so UWB is like what we, what's in

911
00:49:11,105 --> 00:49:14,725
Speaker 8:  use in cars now for automatic unlocking. So it,

912
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:18,685
Speaker 8:  it's precise positioning so it knows how you're approaching. So this way

913
00:49:18,685 --> 00:49:22,365
Speaker 8:  If you are walking sideways across your front lawn, your

914
00:49:22,365 --> 00:49:26,205
Speaker 8:  door's not gonna unlock right? It knows that your, your trajectory towards

915
00:49:26,385 --> 00:49:30,365
Speaker 8:  the lock. So as you're walking towards the lock, If you are running it

916
00:49:30,365 --> 00:49:33,005
Speaker 8:  will unlock faster. Like say you wanna get in your house quick,

917
00:49:33,315 --> 00:49:36,325
Speaker 4:  Does it like whip open the door If you really want to surprise somebody,

918
00:49:36,995 --> 00:49:40,205
Speaker 3:  It's like the vacuum is coming, unlock the door.

919
00:49:41,465 --> 00:49:44,885
Speaker 8:  But it's a great, I think the UWB technology is really what's gonna push

920
00:49:44,895 --> 00:49:48,445
Speaker 8:  smart locks into the mainstream because to date

921
00:49:49,305 --> 00:49:53,165
Speaker 8:  access control has been kind of fiddly. The fingerprint I

922
00:49:53,165 --> 00:49:56,605
Speaker 8:  is my favorite option. But for a lot of people it's not a great option.

923
00:49:57,005 --> 00:50:00,845
Speaker 8:  Fingerprints can be, you know, don't always get recognized. It's

924
00:50:00,945 --> 00:50:04,845
Speaker 8:  fiddly to set up and then the keypad obviously that's, that's

925
00:50:04,845 --> 00:50:07,365
Speaker 8:  almost takes as long time as getting your key out if you're putting there.

926
00:50:07,625 --> 00:50:11,565
Speaker 8:  And then they've had this idea of automatic unlocking for a while but it's

927
00:50:11,565 --> 00:50:13,925
Speaker 8:  never been very good 'cause it uses wifi and

928
00:50:15,495 --> 00:50:19,365
Speaker 8:  geofencing and a few different radios. So like there's so many failure points.

929
00:50:19,395 --> 00:50:23,325
Speaker 8:  Whereas this is just point to point radio to radio as you

930
00:50:23,565 --> 00:50:27,365
Speaker 8:  approach the door will unlock and it unlocks before you get there. So you're

931
00:50:27,365 --> 00:50:30,165
Speaker 8:  not standing there like a lemon for like 30 seconds waiting for your daughter

932
00:50:30,165 --> 00:50:33,125
Speaker 8:  to unlock. Which has happened to me regularly. So quick

933
00:50:33,325 --> 00:50:34,925
Speaker 3:  Question, how do lemons stand?

934
00:50:36,155 --> 00:50:37,085
Speaker 8:  It's an English term

935
00:50:39,955 --> 00:50:40,965
Speaker 8:  backing up in,

936
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:45,365
Speaker 3:  I'm like I'm super fascinated this 'cause there's also a new, there's standards

937
00:50:45,365 --> 00:50:47,565
Speaker 3:  on top of standards, right? Yes. There's,

938
00:50:47,565 --> 00:50:48,325
Speaker 8:  So this is allero,

939
00:50:48,555 --> 00:50:49,445
Speaker 3:  It's called Aero.

940
00:50:49,745 --> 00:50:52,405
Speaker 8:  So this isn't, so ALLERO is coming this year

941
00:50:53,945 --> 00:50:55,205
Speaker 3:  The classic Swar home story.

942
00:50:55,725 --> 00:50:59,645
Speaker 8:  Yes. And it's been known like, so aero's like

943
00:50:59,705 --> 00:51:03,125
Speaker 8:  Matter LiRo is been, is like an industry collaboration between

944
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:07,245
Speaker 8:  Apple, Google, Samsung and then all the lock makers and it's an access

945
00:51:07,245 --> 00:51:10,925
Speaker 8:  control standard to basically make it so that any

946
00:51:10,925 --> 00:51:14,885
Speaker 8:  smartphone can unlock any door lock obviously authorized not

947
00:51:14,885 --> 00:51:18,725
Speaker 8:  just, so rather than having to have a specific platform to use

948
00:51:18,725 --> 00:51:22,285
Speaker 8:  your smart lock or a specific smartphone, any UWDB

949
00:51:22,405 --> 00:51:26,205
Speaker 8:  device or NFC. So it's bringing Apple Home key, the

950
00:51:26,205 --> 00:51:30,005
Speaker 8:  idea of home key to all phones. So right now if you've ever used Apple

951
00:51:30,035 --> 00:51:33,885
Speaker 8:  Home Key, it's very convenient. Put tap your watch to your lock,

952
00:51:34,225 --> 00:51:37,085
Speaker 8:  tap your phone to your lock unlocks it. But you can't use that If you have

953
00:51:37,085 --> 00:51:40,605
Speaker 8:  an Android phone. But now that's with ly we're gonna get

954
00:51:41,285 --> 00:51:45,245
Speaker 8:  NFC unlocking for all phones and UWB unlocking for all

955
00:51:45,245 --> 00:51:49,005
Speaker 8:  compatible phones, obviously you have to have UWB and NFC in your phone.

956
00:51:49,265 --> 00:51:52,365
Speaker 8:  But that's, that's been coming for a while. There's a lot of

957
00:51:53,465 --> 00:51:57,005
Speaker 8:  phones and watches that now have that. So I think, I mean it's gonna take

958
00:51:57,125 --> 00:52:01,085
Speaker 8:  a while. The Allero standard is gonna be announced like what it is

959
00:52:01,145 --> 00:52:04,765
Speaker 8:  the spec this year. But I think the lock manufacturers are already

960
00:52:05,085 --> 00:52:08,605
Speaker 8:  starting to make the locks to work with it. And Apple

961
00:52:08,605 --> 00:52:12,365
Speaker 8:  announced at ww DC last year. Yes last year

962
00:52:12,915 --> 00:52:16,685
Speaker 8:  that that they are supporting the UWB hands free unlocking. So

963
00:52:16,865 --> 00:52:20,405
Speaker 8:  it, there's a lot of momentum there and it is, it's a really seamless

964
00:52:20,495 --> 00:52:24,365
Speaker 8:  experience compared to most of the other ways that you use Smart Lock. So

965
00:52:24,845 --> 00:52:27,805
Speaker 8:  I think we're gonna see a real uptick in Do you have a smart lock? Yeah,

966
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:31,565
Speaker 3:  I've got the encode plus. Okay. Which is home key. Yeah. And then I have

967
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:35,485
Speaker 3:  the cheap Aqura one, which is also home key and that one you

968
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:39,365
Speaker 3:  get what you pay for. It's just like sort of straightforwardly get

969
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:43,125
Speaker 3:  what you pay for. Yeah. But it's great 'cause we just tap the phone on the

970
00:52:43,125 --> 00:52:46,965
Speaker 3:  door and it unlocks And the problem is sometimes I have an Android

971
00:52:46,965 --> 00:52:50,925
Speaker 3:  phone and then I can't do that. Right. And like it seems like all this is

972
00:52:50,925 --> 00:52:53,365
Speaker 3:  just one turn too late. I know you're calling it the year of the smart lock,

973
00:52:53,785 --> 00:52:56,725
Speaker 3:  but it, and there's a rumor that Apple will make a lock this year, which

974
00:52:56,725 --> 00:52:58,645
Speaker 3:  is very funny. Like of all the products

975
00:52:58,645 --> 00:53:00,925
Speaker 8:  That we make with the video built in and that's the other thing we saw video

976
00:53:01,285 --> 00:53:04,925
Speaker 8:  doorbells built into smart locks everywhere and Palm unlocking. I'm not so

977
00:53:04,925 --> 00:53:06,045
Speaker 8:  sure about the palm unlocking. You

978
00:53:06,045 --> 00:53:06,965
Speaker 3:  Just like wave your palm at it.

979
00:53:06,965 --> 00:53:10,005
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I did it a few times. I think Phillips, not Phillips Hu what

980
00:53:10,005 --> 00:53:11,085
Speaker 3:  Does it like your palm?

981
00:53:11,515 --> 00:53:15,205
Speaker 8:  Yeah, they say it's a lot more secure than a fingerprint.

982
00:53:15,845 --> 00:53:18,965
Speaker 8:  Apparently your Palm has more sure things going on.

983
00:53:19,605 --> 00:53:19,965
Speaker 3:  I don't know

984
00:53:19,965 --> 00:53:23,405
Speaker 4:  What we're beating is like a, like a key and a lock. Like I think a fingerprint's

985
00:53:23,525 --> 00:53:24,005
Speaker 4:  probably fine. Yeah,

986
00:53:24,005 --> 00:53:25,685
Speaker 3:  We're we're we're still moving in the right

987
00:53:25,685 --> 00:53:29,205
Speaker 8:  Direction. But then it's the hands free element. You know, you just, no

988
00:53:29,435 --> 00:53:31,005
Speaker 3:  This is not hands free, but

989
00:53:31,005 --> 00:53:32,965
Speaker 8:  It is because you actually touching this hands that's just not touching.

990
00:53:33,065 --> 00:53:33,485
Speaker 8:  You're,

991
00:53:33,485 --> 00:53:37,245
Speaker 3:  This is the most hands actually there's no, there's no hand contact.

992
00:53:37,475 --> 00:53:39,325
Speaker 3:  Hand hand. Very much hand. Yeah.

993
00:53:39,995 --> 00:53:42,285
Speaker 8:  It's, it's in I'd say it's in between. Sure.

994
00:53:42,795 --> 00:53:45,325
Speaker 3:  This is why I want it to just whip open the door when I walk up.

995
00:53:45,545 --> 00:53:47,325
Speaker 8:  See that it doesn't do yet. Can

996
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:50,765
Speaker 3:  You set the velocity? Can you be like, this is how fast I can run.

997
00:53:52,625 --> 00:53:56,565
Speaker 8:  No, it it, so that's what I, I hadn't Schlag Schlag was the first

998
00:53:56,565 --> 00:54:00,365
Speaker 8:  company I'd heard talk about velocity. So it, but I think that's neat because

999
00:54:00,385 --> 00:54:04,125
Speaker 8:  If you are in a hurry rather than it, you suddenly

1000
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:08,045
Speaker 8:  have to stop. Yeah. It's gonna, it it can anticipate it's reacting

1001
00:54:08,045 --> 00:54:11,285
Speaker 8:  to you and that's really where the smart home's going. I think it's like

1002
00:54:11,785 --> 00:54:15,605
Speaker 8:  it anticipates your needs rather than you needing to tell it what you

1003
00:54:15,605 --> 00:54:19,525
Speaker 8:  want to do or program it or put buttons in, you know, push buttons,

1004
00:54:19,625 --> 00:54:23,245
Speaker 8:  put your fingerprint and the smart your home is starting to react to you.

1005
00:54:23,305 --> 00:54:25,245
Speaker 8:  And that's kind of where we're moving I think.

1006
00:54:25,505 --> 00:54:29,365
Speaker 3:  So what's really interesting is, so you know Apple, this is kinda the second

1007
00:54:29,365 --> 00:54:33,325
Speaker 3:  time they've pulled this move, right? They did Home Kit and then they

1008
00:54:33,325 --> 00:54:36,805
Speaker 3:  gave a lot of home kit away to become Matter. Then they did Home Keys and

1009
00:54:36,805 --> 00:54:40,765
Speaker 3:  they gave a lot of home key away to be Aly and we'll see if that comes to

1010
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:44,685
Speaker 3:  anything right? But like you can see like they're moving more things into

1011
00:54:44,685 --> 00:54:48,605
Speaker 3:  the industry ecosystem because they, they just need the ecosystem

1012
00:54:48,605 --> 00:54:52,205
Speaker 3:  to exist, right? And very, very few companies wanna make stuff for just one

1013
00:54:52,565 --> 00:54:55,725
Speaker 3:  platform, especially at the scale most of these companies operate at. But

1014
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:59,525
Speaker 3:  then the rumors are like Apple will just make a lock with a face

1015
00:54:59,555 --> 00:55:03,525
Speaker 3:  like face ID built into it. And that makes no sense to me. And then the

1016
00:55:03,525 --> 00:55:06,965
Speaker 3:  rumor is this year Apple will do like a smart home

1017
00:55:07,955 --> 00:55:09,445
Speaker 3:  iPad situation that

1018
00:55:09,445 --> 00:55:09,965
Speaker 8:  Will get,

1019
00:55:10,825 --> 00:55:13,485
Speaker 3:  But then I'm just like looking at the other news here, which is Aqura has

1020
00:55:13,485 --> 00:55:17,285
Speaker 3:  announced Ooh like a wall mountable smart home controller. Yes. And

1021
00:55:17,285 --> 00:55:20,525
Speaker 3:  you're like oh they're just gonna kill their, this ecosystem of products

1022
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:24,005
Speaker 3:  they need to make this work that they keep giving the standards away to.

1023
00:55:24,475 --> 00:55:28,285
Speaker 3:  They're just going to eat them. Like the equator thing is

1024
00:55:28,285 --> 00:55:31,725
Speaker 3:  wild. So has anybody ever pause is here, I know he has

1025
00:55:32,905 --> 00:55:35,005
Speaker 3:  the CEO of home assistance here. I know this person has done it,

1026
00:55:36,585 --> 00:55:39,325
Speaker 3:  but has anybody ever been like, I'm gonna put an iPad on my wall to control

1027
00:55:39,345 --> 00:55:43,045
Speaker 3:  my smart home stuff? It's this yes, it's our audience. I know

1028
00:55:44,075 --> 00:55:46,965
Speaker 3:  more of you than subscribe to the art store on the frame TV is, that's what

1029
00:55:46,965 --> 00:55:50,245
Speaker 3:  I wanna say. And it's like hard. It's just like a fundamentally complicated

1030
00:55:50,275 --> 00:55:53,685
Speaker 3:  idea. 'cause you gotta get power to the iPad, you gotta keep the iPad in

1031
00:55:53,735 --> 00:55:56,765
Speaker 3:  kiosk mode or you gotta run an Android tablet. You end up with a bunch of

1032
00:55:56,765 --> 00:56:00,605
Speaker 3:  weird matter I can you tell how much therapy I do with Jen on like a

1033
00:56:00,605 --> 00:56:03,765
Speaker 3:  day-to-day basis about pharma stuff. And so

1034
00:56:04,535 --> 00:56:07,765
Speaker 3:  Aqura has these new ones, I I think you've actually seen them where they

1035
00:56:07,765 --> 00:56:10,685
Speaker 3:  just replaced your light switches in the way that,

1036
00:56:12,165 --> 00:56:16,145
Speaker 3:  has anybody ever seen the new like aftermarket screens you can put in

1037
00:56:16,145 --> 00:56:19,145
Speaker 3:  cars where you just like take out the old radio and they're just like, fuck

1038
00:56:19,145 --> 00:56:23,065
Speaker 3:  it tablet. Which like covers up all the vents and now it's

1039
00:56:23,165 --> 00:56:24,925
Speaker 3:  like, what if we do that in your house? It's like we're gonna take out your

1040
00:56:24,925 --> 00:56:28,885
Speaker 3:  light switches and we're just gonna mount a seven inch display where your

1041
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:32,245
Speaker 3:  light switch was and guess where the power comes from? The power to your

1042
00:56:32,245 --> 00:56:35,605
Speaker 3:  light switch and then this will be the panel. Yeah. And this feels like the

1043
00:56:35,605 --> 00:56:36,325
Speaker 3:  new thing to me.

1044
00:56:36,475 --> 00:56:40,285
Speaker 8:  Yeah, this is this smart home control interfaces, which is something I go

1045
00:56:40,285 --> 00:56:43,965
Speaker 8:  on about a lot on the site. It's like because you voice

1046
00:56:44,065 --> 00:56:47,925
Speaker 8:  and phone control are just not compatible in a household

1047
00:56:47,925 --> 00:56:51,245
Speaker 8:  where there's more than one person. Like you need ways to control your smart

1048
00:56:51,245 --> 00:56:55,205
Speaker 8:  home. And Brilliant was the first sort of air company in this

1049
00:56:55,205 --> 00:56:59,165
Speaker 8:  space that did replacing the light switch with a touchscreen panel. But

1050
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:03,085
Speaker 8:  what's happened now is that with matter, you've now got, you're

1051
00:57:03,085 --> 00:57:06,965
Speaker 8:  not locking yourself into an ecosystem. And the problem had been, even though

1052
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:10,805
Speaker 8:  brilliant tried with integrations is that there just weren't enough things.

1053
00:57:11,385 --> 00:57:14,125
Speaker 8:  If you're gonna wire something to your house, it needs to control everything.

1054
00:57:14,585 --> 00:57:17,685
Speaker 8:  And a carer right now it is not quite there but

1055
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:21,725
Speaker 8:  with matter they're saying they're gonna be able to, you'll basically eventually

1056
00:57:21,745 --> 00:57:25,565
Speaker 8:  be able to control any matter compatible device straight

1057
00:57:25,635 --> 00:57:29,605
Speaker 8:  from the touch screen. It's wired to lights so you're solving the problem

1058
00:57:29,665 --> 00:57:33,325
Speaker 8:  of your lights. You can, you know, dim change

1059
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:37,165
Speaker 8:  colors, set scenes using the touch panel for the

1060
00:57:37,285 --> 00:57:41,005
Speaker 8:  light that it's wired to. And then any other lights in your home

1061
00:57:41,225 --> 00:57:45,205
Speaker 8:  or maybe your door door lock. It's also a video intercom. So If you

1062
00:57:45,205 --> 00:57:49,125
Speaker 8:  have video doorbell, it'll pull up when someone rings you can talk

1063
00:57:49,125 --> 00:57:53,045
Speaker 8:  to them. It has a little microphone. It's big and chunky though.

1064
00:57:53,065 --> 00:57:56,325
Speaker 8:  And then there's a spousal approval factor when it comes to light switches.

1065
00:57:57,185 --> 00:58:00,645
Speaker 8:  So my actual favorite, one of the AKA they showed off three

1066
00:58:00,645 --> 00:58:04,525
Speaker 8:  touchscreen panels and one has a little dial, it

1067
00:58:04,525 --> 00:58:08,365
Speaker 8:  has a tiny little screen in it that you can swipe the screen to choose

1068
00:58:08,365 --> 00:58:11,245
Speaker 8:  what you want to select. So say I want to turn on the living room lights

1069
00:58:11,245 --> 00:58:15,045
Speaker 8:  or dim them and then it has this lovely tactile dial that you can just turn

1070
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:15,645
Speaker 8:  And that's

1071
00:58:15,885 --> 00:58:19,485
Speaker 4:  U us is like cool and tactile as light switches. They're like, they good.

1072
00:58:19,675 --> 00:58:19,965
Speaker 4:  This

1073
00:58:19,965 --> 00:58:20,885
Speaker 3:  Looks like, like a thermostat

1074
00:58:20,915 --> 00:58:22,525
Speaker 4:  Spousal approval through the roof on

1075
00:58:22,525 --> 00:58:26,245
Speaker 8:  Light switches. Philistine. Yeah, but

1076
00:58:26,305 --> 00:58:29,165
Speaker 8:  you can't, the light switch turns your light on and off or maybe dims it.

1077
00:58:29,515 --> 00:58:33,165
Speaker 8:  This I can swipe and touch one button

1078
00:58:33,345 --> 00:58:37,165
Speaker 8:  and like all the lights in my house or in my living room will set to a

1079
00:58:37,165 --> 00:58:41,005
Speaker 8:  mood. You know, the mood, the movie time dim to a

1080
00:58:41,005 --> 00:58:44,125
Speaker 8:  certain light, maybe throw in a little funky

1081
00:58:44,735 --> 00:58:48,405
Speaker 8:  color just for some, you know, fun. No you, I'm not selling. How many

1082
00:58:48,405 --> 00:58:51,245
Speaker 4:  People in your household know successfully how to operate this thing? Well

1083
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:52,245
Speaker 8:  That's the thing. These,

1084
01:00:57,675 --> 01:01:00,295
Speaker 4:  V's. Job this week was to wear all of the smart glasses

1085
01:01:01,875 --> 01:01:05,455
Speaker 4:  and also all of the wearables, which I think means like touching gross things

1086
01:01:05,525 --> 01:01:09,455
Speaker 4:  more than most people who go to CES. You've had a lot of like

1087
01:01:09,505 --> 01:01:12,095
Speaker 4:  close encounters with gadgets that we don't recommend at this show.

1088
01:01:13,275 --> 01:01:17,215
Speaker 9:  Thanks for reminding me David. I actually hadn't

1089
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:17,815
Speaker 9:  thought about that.

1090
01:01:18,355 --> 01:01:20,935
Speaker 3:  So your job is putting stuff that's been on other people's face and your

1091
01:01:20,935 --> 01:01:21,775
Speaker 3:  face. Yeah. How are you feeling?

1092
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:24,175
Speaker 4:  I, you know, which violates every rule of C.

1093
01:01:27,395 --> 01:01:29,695
Speaker 4:  Can we talk about smart glasses for me? Yeah, let's talk about smart glasses.

1094
01:01:29,795 --> 01:01:33,575
Speaker 4:  If there is like a device category that everybody was excited

1095
01:01:33,575 --> 01:01:35,615
Speaker 4:  about this week, I feel like it's smart glasses.

1096
01:01:35,995 --> 01:01:39,295
Speaker 3:  Can I just read you the names of these companies that be typed into the list

1097
01:01:39,955 --> 01:01:43,415
Speaker 9:  And these are the ones that I was like, okay, in my inbox there's like at

1098
01:01:43,415 --> 01:01:47,175
Speaker 9:  least 500,000 smart glass pitches. These are the ones that I selected

1099
01:01:47,275 --> 01:01:48,575
Speaker 9:  as worthy of talking about.

1100
01:01:49,325 --> 01:01:53,075
Speaker 3:  Okay, rocket that's spelled R-O-K-I-D

1101
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:55,875
Speaker 3:  nuance X reel. Everyone knows Nuance Music,

1102
01:01:57,475 --> 01:01:57,965
Speaker 3:  Camilio,

1103
01:01:58,945 --> 01:01:59,365
Speaker 9:  Camelo,

1104
01:01:59,625 --> 01:02:03,205
Speaker 3:  Camelo, even Realities and then Halladay. Yeah

1105
01:02:03,675 --> 01:02:06,445
Speaker 3:  this, these are just, people are just coming. I'm pretty sure holidays are

1106
01:02:06,565 --> 01:02:09,565
Speaker 3:  referenced to Ready Player one, right? Because holiday and Ready player one

1107
01:02:09,575 --> 01:02:09,925
Speaker 3:  seems

1108
01:02:09,925 --> 01:02:10,125
Speaker 4:  Right,

1109
01:02:11,155 --> 01:02:14,335
Speaker 3:  But it's just like we're, we're entering a new zone of companies

1110
01:02:15,235 --> 01:02:18,285
Speaker 3:  like, we're like reality Hacker Labs. Like it's like that's what

1111
01:02:18,285 --> 01:02:20,870
Speaker 4:  We're gonna do. Well it just makes me think like this stuff must have gotten

1112
01:02:20,925 --> 01:02:23,525
Speaker 4:  a lot easier to make in the relatively recent

1113
01:02:23,525 --> 01:02:27,445
Speaker 9:  Mess. Phenomenally easier to make. This is a thing that, so I've been a

1114
01:02:27,445 --> 01:02:31,245
Speaker 9:  smart glasses skeptic for a really long, long time because

1115
01:02:31,245 --> 01:02:33,645
Speaker 9:  there were just, I mean we all know what happened with Google Glass, right?

1116
01:02:33,645 --> 01:02:36,365
Speaker 9:  Glass holes like eh, that's not really a thing.

1117
01:02:37,705 --> 01:02:41,365
Speaker 9:  But I think in the last two to three years the technology has

1118
01:02:41,365 --> 01:02:45,205
Speaker 9:  miniaturized and basically expanded to a point where it's like, oh

1119
01:02:45,555 --> 01:02:49,305
Speaker 9:  crap, this could actually happen. And

1120
01:02:49,325 --> 01:02:52,265
Speaker 9:  that's kind of what we're seeing on the floor. So I think we've gotten to

1121
01:02:52,265 --> 01:02:56,145
Speaker 9:  a point where everyone has agreed, oh smart glasses, they're a

1122
01:02:56,265 --> 01:02:57,385
Speaker 9:  thing. This is happening. Wait,

1123
01:02:57,405 --> 01:03:01,345
Speaker 3:  Can we just put a little definition around smart glasses? 'cause

1124
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:04,985
Speaker 3:  it's pretty wide open right now. So the Meta ray

1125
01:03:05,035 --> 01:03:08,545
Speaker 3:  bands, I think Meta will call smart glasses. Yes. But they have no

1126
01:03:08,575 --> 01:03:11,265
Speaker 3:  display component. Yes. Right. That's a camera and

1127
01:03:11,415 --> 01:03:13,025
Speaker 9:  There's like categories

1128
01:03:13,515 --> 01:03:16,785
Speaker 3:  Voice assistant and I think Meta is dramatically

1129
01:03:16,855 --> 01:03:19,585
Speaker 3:  overselling. Does anybody here have them? Alright.

1130
01:03:20,385 --> 01:03:23,805
Speaker 9:  No you can. You see, you see, you see Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people hop them

1131
01:03:23,805 --> 01:03:26,445
Speaker 3:  Substantially more people than pay for the art store. I just wanna be clear

1132
01:03:26,445 --> 01:03:30,285
Speaker 3:  about that too. You're, is there you, do you have them because

1133
01:03:30,285 --> 01:03:33,895
Speaker 3:  they're a camera or because you're talking to Meta AI all the time. How many

1134
01:03:33,895 --> 01:03:37,835
Speaker 3:  of you're talking to Meta AI all the time on your redbands? No, I

1135
01:03:37,835 --> 01:03:40,755
Speaker 3:  we would point out either everyone's embarrassed or no hands have gone up.

1136
01:03:41,335 --> 01:03:43,875
Speaker 3:  How many of you're too embarrassed to admit that you're talking to weird

1137
01:03:43,875 --> 01:03:46,835
Speaker 3:  Meta ai right. Bands all the time. How many of you're using the camera all

1138
01:03:46,835 --> 01:03:49,115
Speaker 3:  the time? 'cause it's really convenient to Yeah, that's a lot of hands. Yeah.

1139
01:03:49,115 --> 01:03:53,075
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And So I think Meta is dramatically overselling the smart glass,

1140
01:03:53,735 --> 01:03:57,475
Speaker 3:  the smartness of its smart glasses. 'cause it's not a display. Yeah

1141
01:03:57,545 --> 01:04:01,435
Speaker 3:  it's just a camera on some glasses that look okay, sure. But all the

1142
01:04:01,435 --> 01:04:04,635
Speaker 3:  ones that we're talking about Cs are displays. Yes. Right. That's the new

1143
01:04:04,955 --> 01:04:05,155
Speaker 3:  category.

1144
01:04:05,505 --> 01:04:07,875
Speaker 4:  Well that everybody including Meta agrees that's the next thing.

1145
01:04:08,585 --> 01:04:11,485
Speaker 3:  So yeah. But like Meta is like this is a surprise hit like smart glasses

1146
01:04:11,545 --> 01:04:15,085
Speaker 3:  are the future. I'm like weird little cameras are the future for you.

1147
01:04:15,675 --> 01:04:19,325
Speaker 9:  Well it's, it's kind of both. Yeah, it's kind of both. I just think

1148
01:04:19,395 --> 01:04:23,325
Speaker 9:  Meta rolled out the AI in such a way that people just don't

1149
01:04:23,325 --> 01:04:27,205
Speaker 9:  know how to use it properly. And if they say multimodal one more time, I'm

1150
01:04:27,205 --> 01:04:31,005
Speaker 9:  going to lose it. That's just like where I'm at. But

1151
01:04:32,145 --> 01:04:35,645
Speaker 9:  you know the interesting thing was like, let's talk about Rocket, right?

1152
01:04:35,745 --> 01:04:39,525
Speaker 9:  So Rocket it does everything that the Meta glasses do.

1153
01:04:39,795 --> 01:04:43,645
Speaker 9:  They have a camera in it but there is a display and it's a pretty

1154
01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:47,525
Speaker 9:  cool display but it's a, I think what they call this type of display is a

1155
01:04:47,525 --> 01:04:50,285
Speaker 9:  monocular monochrome display. And so

1156
01:04:50,285 --> 01:04:51,725
Speaker 4:  Monocular monochrome display, I like

1157
01:04:51,725 --> 01:04:55,645
Speaker 9:  That monocular monochrome display with micro etched displays in

1158
01:04:55,645 --> 01:04:58,805
Speaker 9:  the lenses. So like you look at them, they look like a normal pair of glasses.

1159
01:04:59,075 --> 01:05:02,685
Speaker 9:  They are much lighter than the Meta ray advance 'cause weight. We've talked

1160
01:05:02,685 --> 01:05:06,245
Speaker 9:  about this a lot. The weight is kind of a deal breaker sometimes. Yeah. When

1161
01:05:06,245 --> 01:05:10,205
Speaker 9:  you're wearing them. So they're quiet light, you can't actually see

1162
01:05:10,205 --> 01:05:13,845
Speaker 9:  the display unless you like the light hits you in a certain way it's etched

1163
01:05:14,235 --> 01:05:17,485
Speaker 9:  into the actual glass. But when you look into it, you can see

1164
01:05:17,995 --> 01:05:21,805
Speaker 9:  kind of like a, like if you're thinking of a military fighter jet and that

1165
01:05:21,805 --> 01:05:25,725
Speaker 9:  type of green laser looking display in there, you can see it okay it's an

1166
01:05:25,865 --> 01:05:29,365
Speaker 9:  actual display. And then the demo, I got

1167
01:05:29,745 --> 01:05:33,525
Speaker 9:  the, the person was speaking to me in Chinese and I could see the translation

1168
01:05:33,525 --> 01:05:37,405
Speaker 9:  happening in real time really. And then I could say something to her and

1169
01:05:37,405 --> 01:05:39,005
Speaker 9:  she would answer me in Chinese and there

1170
01:05:39,005 --> 01:05:41,845
Speaker 3:  Was no external commute. Was this going out to a cloud? Was this happening

1171
01:05:41,845 --> 01:05:42,085
Speaker 3:  locally?

1172
01:05:43,825 --> 01:05:47,075
Speaker 9:  Well that, that was a hard question because again she's speaking to me in

1173
01:05:47,075 --> 01:05:47,235
Speaker 9:  Chinese.

1174
01:05:48,425 --> 01:05:52,315
Speaker 3:  Well I'm just wondering like yeah If you can do that locally on a

1175
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:53,995
Speaker 3:  pair of glasses with a reasonable battery life, that's,

1176
01:05:54,595 --> 01:05:57,395
Speaker 9:  I mean it is attached to your phone, right? Sure. Okay. Yeah. So that that's,

1177
01:05:57,395 --> 01:06:00,955
Speaker 9:  that's basically, we are still at the point where your phone is powering

1178
01:06:00,955 --> 01:06:04,475
Speaker 9:  all of this and it's over Bluetooth. It's not like computing everything locally

1179
01:06:04,655 --> 01:06:08,555
Speaker 9:  on that particular thing, but it's pretty wild. And as like journalists you

1180
01:06:08,555 --> 01:06:12,195
Speaker 9:  can have a teleprompter on there, you're wearing a pair of glasses, it does

1181
01:06:12,215 --> 01:06:16,155
Speaker 9:  not look like you're seeing anything. And this kind

1182
01:06:16,155 --> 01:06:20,115
Speaker 9:  of subsect of the monocular green laser thing that I

1183
01:06:20,115 --> 01:06:23,915
Speaker 9:  saw three of them, which I was like, oh that's a mini trend within a big

1184
01:06:23,915 --> 01:06:25,435
Speaker 9:  trend. Cool, cool stuff.

1185
01:06:25,435 --> 01:06:28,555
Speaker 3:  Right? There's a component here that everyone has decided they can use and

1186
01:06:28,555 --> 01:06:28,635
Speaker 3:  like,

1187
01:06:28,855 --> 01:06:31,595
Speaker 9:  And the reason why is because they have solved in a certain

1188
01:06:32,535 --> 01:06:36,075
Speaker 9:  aspect the ambient light problem. Oh. So the ambient light problem with smart

1189
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:39,955
Speaker 9:  glasses is that you walk out into the sun and you can't see shit because

1190
01:06:40,345 --> 01:06:43,915
Speaker 9:  it's the sun, it like blinds everything out. So there's no point in a smart

1191
01:06:43,915 --> 01:06:47,275
Speaker 9:  glass If you can't see the display that you paid a lot of money for. But

1192
01:06:47,275 --> 01:06:51,155
Speaker 9:  with the green it's easier on your eyeballs. So like green

1193
01:06:51,155 --> 01:06:54,675
Speaker 9:  light is apparently the healthiest for your eye. It's the easiest to see

1194
01:06:54,695 --> 01:06:57,715
Speaker 9:  and it borrows from military technology because the contrast is

1195
01:06:57,715 --> 01:07:00,475
Speaker 4:  Really great. I will say what you just said is alarmingly similar to how

1196
01:07:00,575 --> 01:07:04,115
Speaker 4:  humane described the projector on the pin. And that didn't go super great.

1197
01:07:04,255 --> 01:07:04,475
Speaker 4:  No

1198
01:07:04,475 --> 01:07:05,475
Speaker 9:  It didn't. But it's

1199
01:07:05,475 --> 01:07:08,835
Speaker 3:  Like, it's little different. Did you ever say they borrowed from military?

1200
01:07:09,655 --> 01:07:12,555
Speaker 4:  No, but they were big on green lasers and how they were gonna be useful in

1201
01:07:12,715 --> 01:07:14,355
Speaker 4:  sunlight. That is. And then you go outside and it's

1202
01:07:14,355 --> 01:07:17,195
Speaker 9:  What if it work? But that's it's but that it's outside in the sunlight. Like

1203
01:07:17,195 --> 01:07:20,715
Speaker 9:  that's the, that so like holiday's solution to that. And I found Holliday

1204
01:07:20,715 --> 01:07:23,795
Speaker 9:  to be the most finicky of the three with the smallest amount. 'cause it's

1205
01:07:23,795 --> 01:07:27,635
Speaker 9:  like this tiny little dot it's held in like the bar

1206
01:07:27,735 --> 01:07:31,555
Speaker 9:  of it. So like when you think about wearing smart glasses and where the

1207
01:07:31,555 --> 01:07:35,235
Speaker 9:  display appears, it's actually like in the bar itself. So when you're talking

1208
01:07:35,255 --> 01:07:39,115
Speaker 9:  to someone, they're just basically doing this the entire time looking

1209
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:42,115
Speaker 9:  up into the corner. And so it looks, looks like they're rolling your eyes

1210
01:07:42,115 --> 01:07:43,035
Speaker 9:  at you the entire time.

1211
01:07:44,105 --> 01:07:47,315
Speaker 3:  Well So I, I'm curious about this 'cause you got to see them. Yeah but you

1212
01:07:47,315 --> 01:07:49,835
Speaker 3:  know, earlier we were talking about like is there a product at CS that everyone

1213
01:07:49,835 --> 01:07:53,315
Speaker 3:  was talking about and like the holiday glasses are the closest to it And

1214
01:07:53,315 --> 01:07:55,915
Speaker 3:  then I think a lot of people got the demo and had that experience and it

1215
01:07:55,915 --> 01:07:57,675
Speaker 3:  stopped being the thing that everyone was talking about it.

1216
01:07:57,675 --> 01:07:59,835
Speaker 4:  It's, yeah, it seemed much more exciting at the beginning of the week than

1217
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:01,875
Speaker 4:  I think it turned out to be once people started trying it. So

1218
01:08:01,875 --> 01:08:05,835
Speaker 9:  Like here's the thing, smart glasses. Yeah but you, the most annoying thing

1219
01:08:05,835 --> 01:08:09,315
Speaker 9:  about XR smart glasses, any of these things is that you have to see it to

1220
01:08:09,315 --> 01:08:13,075
Speaker 9:  believe it. And you know, when we're thinking about making

1221
01:08:13,075 --> 01:08:16,085
Speaker 9:  videos for these things and trying to like convey to people like, oh this

1222
01:08:16,085 --> 01:08:19,325
Speaker 9:  is actually cool. Literally you're taking these glasses, you're taking your

1223
01:08:19,325 --> 01:08:22,725
Speaker 9:  phone and you're like, if I angle the thing in the right way, I can get a

1224
01:08:22,725 --> 01:08:26,405
Speaker 9:  really blurry half portion of the green laser that you're gonna see.

1225
01:08:27,105 --> 01:08:30,485
Speaker 9:  So it's really hard to convey to people that, and like the holiday thing,

1226
01:08:30,645 --> 01:08:33,845
Speaker 9:  I think they got in early at the show, which was like good for them. But

1227
01:08:33,845 --> 01:08:37,705
Speaker 9:  like you're literally like, I don't know and it's not

1228
01:08:37,705 --> 01:08:40,945
Speaker 9:  as discreet because when you talk to someone you can see a green.in their

1229
01:08:40,965 --> 01:08:44,105
Speaker 9:  eye, like just a green.in their eye and you're like,

1230
01:08:44,605 --> 01:08:45,265
Speaker 9:  that's weird.

1231
01:08:45,405 --> 01:08:46,985
Speaker 3:  That's my targeting laser for the robot

1232
01:08:46,985 --> 01:08:49,945
Speaker 9:  Robot. That's my target. I'm an Android robot with a green dot.

1233
01:08:50,405 --> 01:08:52,745
Speaker 3:  So always. So you talk about the demo of the translation, like we've always

1234
01:08:52,745 --> 01:08:56,625
Speaker 3:  talked about, there's a lot of problems between here and the dream of AR

1235
01:08:56,625 --> 01:09:00,545
Speaker 3:  glasses, right? So you need a display,

1236
01:09:00,545 --> 01:09:04,465
Speaker 3:  which it seems like some people are getting closer to one display

1237
01:09:04,785 --> 01:09:08,745
Speaker 3:  solution that you can put on reasonably lightweight glasses. You need compute.

1238
01:09:08,925 --> 01:09:12,465
Speaker 3:  And it sounds like we're offloading that to the phone. I now, yeah,

1239
01:09:13,495 --> 01:09:17,465
Speaker 3:  then you need a bat, you need a battery that is not heavy but Verizon, enough

1240
01:09:17,465 --> 01:09:20,225
Speaker 9:  Battery life, you need a battery the more advanced it is for sure.

1241
01:09:20,765 --> 01:09:24,725
Speaker 3:  And then you, you like need stuff to do. Yeah,

1242
01:09:24,725 --> 01:09:27,605
Speaker 3:  right? Like you need to like augment reality. Like the, the goal is like,

1243
01:09:27,645 --> 01:09:30,965
Speaker 3:  I, I say this all the time, If you can just make me a pair of glasses

1244
01:09:31,295 --> 01:09:34,565
Speaker 3:  where you can just tell me your name, like I'll buy 'em in a heartbeat. The

1245
01:09:34,565 --> 01:09:37,325
Speaker 3:  problem is you need to build like a worldwide facial recognition database.

1246
01:09:37,325 --> 01:09:39,525
Speaker 3:  Just gimme surveillance state and everything will be fine and it's, you know,

1247
01:09:39,525 --> 01:09:41,685
Speaker 3:  we're headed there anyway. Okay. So like when we talk, just gimme the glasses

1248
01:09:42,025 --> 01:09:44,565
Speaker 3:  but you need to like build all this other stuff. Yeah. And it seems like

1249
01:09:44,565 --> 01:09:48,485
Speaker 3:  the ones here, they're really focused on like display.

1250
01:09:48,945 --> 01:09:52,125
Speaker 9:  So like what, what it is now and what I've seen on the floor is that we have

1251
01:09:52,125 --> 01:09:55,405
Speaker 9:  all agreed that smart glasses, we've agreed on smart glasses with all these

1252
01:09:55,645 --> 01:09:59,485
Speaker 9:  companies. What we've not agreed on is how to do them. So

1253
01:09:59,515 --> 01:10:03,365
Speaker 9:  what you have at CES is a bunch of people going smart glasses and now we're

1254
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:07,045
Speaker 9:  gonna throw so much spaghetti on the wall and see what sticks. Yeah.

1255
01:10:07,345 --> 01:10:11,325
Speaker 9:  So they're trying to figure out, and like Google told me this

1256
01:10:11,325 --> 01:10:15,245
Speaker 9:  when I went to see the Android XR demos of their smart glasses prototype

1257
01:10:15,265 --> 01:10:19,205
Speaker 9:  is that you cannot approach it from one way. You have to approach it from

1258
01:10:19,205 --> 01:10:23,165
Speaker 9:  all other ways. So the, the thing about META'S glasses that

1259
01:10:23,165 --> 01:10:26,925
Speaker 9:  kind of really kicked the door open is it got normal people thinking

1260
01:10:26,925 --> 01:10:30,765
Speaker 9:  like, oh I have a use for this. I'm gonna take a, like for me, I'm gonna

1261
01:10:30,765 --> 01:10:34,125
Speaker 9:  take so many videos of my cats and they're not gonna be freaked out because

1262
01:10:34,165 --> 01:10:38,085
Speaker 9:  I have a phone in their face. And it sounds really stupid, but that actually

1263
01:10:38,085 --> 01:10:41,285
Speaker 9:  is a thing that gets people going toward it. And then for some of these people

1264
01:10:41,285 --> 01:10:44,925
Speaker 9:  they're like, oh you know what teleprompters, how many people would,

1265
01:10:45,105 --> 01:10:48,285
Speaker 9:  If you have to speak on anything, how many of you would love to have a little

1266
01:10:48,285 --> 01:10:51,725
Speaker 9:  teleprompter in front of your eyes that you can read that no one knows that

1267
01:10:51,725 --> 01:10:55,245
Speaker 9:  you're reading? Like it's great, you could have notes in something. Like

1268
01:10:55,245 --> 01:10:57,605
Speaker 9:  you can travel to a different country and yeah, your phone's in your pocket,

1269
01:10:57,745 --> 01:11:00,885
Speaker 9:  but you can talk to someone and understand what they're saying. Like that's

1270
01:11:01,905 --> 01:11:05,725
Speaker 9:  pretty cool If you think about that. Yeah. So those are like

1271
01:11:05,725 --> 01:11:08,885
Speaker 9:  real life use cases. So you have people approaching from the style first,

1272
01:11:08,885 --> 01:11:12,125
Speaker 9:  like the Essilor Luxottica people, they're just like, you know, I saw them

1273
01:11:12,125 --> 01:11:15,685
Speaker 9:  today, they were very Italian, very stylish. I felt like a schlub next to

1274
01:11:15,685 --> 01:11:19,365
Speaker 9:  them. But they were like, we want things that people use. So the nuance audio

1275
01:11:19,515 --> 01:11:22,885
Speaker 9:  ones, they are over the counter hearing aids in a glasses format because

1276
01:11:22,885 --> 01:11:26,765
Speaker 9:  it reduces stigma. It can still like noise cancel to a

1277
01:11:26,765 --> 01:11:30,165
Speaker 9:  certain, it is really cool. 'cause if I look at David and he's talking, it'll

1278
01:11:30,195 --> 01:11:34,005
Speaker 9:  amplify his voice, but then if I turn away from him, it'll cancel him out.

1279
01:11:35,145 --> 01:11:35,725
Speaker 9:  So like that's just,

1280
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:37,285
Speaker 3:  That's the goal. That's that's a great idea.

1281
01:11:37,465 --> 01:11:41,285
Speaker 9:  You want idea? Yeah. So it's pretty cool. Yeah. And it supports all prescriptions

1282
01:11:41,285 --> 01:11:45,125
Speaker 9:  and it's like kind of geared towards the elderly who need glasses to

1283
01:11:45,125 --> 01:11:48,405
Speaker 9:  see and can't hear. That's so that's like a real use case that they have.

1284
01:11:48,945 --> 01:11:52,765
Speaker 9:  And then you have people on like the other end of the spectrum, like the

1285
01:11:52,765 --> 01:11:56,725
Speaker 9:  music is and the X reel and they're like, we are the future. You will

1286
01:11:56,725 --> 01:12:00,485
Speaker 9:  be watching movies on your glasses and like everything will be seen and

1287
01:12:00,485 --> 01:12:04,085
Speaker 9:  there'll be a little, so they had me like AI prompted

1288
01:12:04,745 --> 01:12:08,645
Speaker 9:  Fat Cat with unicorn wings that I could just like pinch to

1289
01:12:08,765 --> 01:12:11,005
Speaker 9:  be large. And I'm like, sure, that's a thing that's smart.

1290
01:12:12,065 --> 01:12:14,365
Speaker 3:  But like that's a display. Like what they're saying is like a display. You

1291
01:12:14,365 --> 01:12:16,485
Speaker 3:  can put a display in front of your eyes, but Nuance has display. We don't

1292
01:12:16,485 --> 01:12:17,045
Speaker 3:  know what's gonna be on

1293
01:12:17,045 --> 01:12:20,045
Speaker 9:  There. Display Nuance has no display, right? That's just audio only. So like,

1294
01:12:20,205 --> 01:12:23,805
Speaker 9:  I think in the transition, like BS kind of kicked it off with the glasses

1295
01:12:23,955 --> 01:12:27,845
Speaker 9:  with just making them audio. That's cool. Carmelo has

1296
01:12:27,865 --> 01:12:31,685
Speaker 9:  no display. The cool thing about Culo, and this is the only cool

1297
01:12:31,685 --> 01:12:35,165
Speaker 9:  thing is that you, you slide, you press a button and it changes the color

1298
01:12:35,185 --> 01:12:36,445
Speaker 9:  of the lens. And I'm

1299
01:12:36,445 --> 01:12:38,925
Speaker 3:  Like, that's why I thought it was called camilio. I just wanna be very honest.

1300
01:12:39,065 --> 01:12:41,045
Speaker 3:  Oh yeah, probably should be.

1301
01:12:41,225 --> 01:12:45,045
Speaker 9:  But you hear that on paper and you're like, that's stupid. Then you go into

1302
01:12:45,045 --> 01:12:48,845
Speaker 9:  the thing and you're like, Ooh, it changes colors. I'm so cool. Or

1303
01:12:48,845 --> 01:12:52,165
Speaker 9:  like you have, you change the tint. So it's like, oh it's really bright out.

1304
01:12:52,245 --> 01:12:54,885
Speaker 9:  I need the tint to be full, full of the way. Or if you're like me and you're

1305
01:12:54,895 --> 01:12:58,725
Speaker 9:  shady, you're like, oh I don't like this person. I'm gonna pull it all the

1306
01:12:58,725 --> 01:13:01,165
Speaker 9:  way to dark So I can make eyes at them. And So

1307
01:13:01,405 --> 01:13:05,005
Speaker 3:  I love the idea that you're wearing your glasses and just ruthlessly like

1308
01:13:05,005 --> 01:13:08,685
Speaker 3:  subtweeting people. Oh for sure. Like you're like, goodbye, goodbye. And

1309
01:13:08,685 --> 01:13:10,725
Speaker 3:  then you like turn your head, you're like, I can't hear you anymore. I

1310
01:13:10,725 --> 01:13:12,165
Speaker 9:  Can't. It's like, ooh,

1311
01:13:12,545 --> 01:13:14,965
Speaker 3:  Yay. It. It does seem like all of this

1312
01:13:16,295 --> 01:13:18,925
Speaker 3:  right there, there's some part of it's like, I think really fun, right? There's

1313
01:13:18,925 --> 01:13:21,405
Speaker 3:  all very innovative, we're all gonna try a bunch of stuff, but it also feels

1314
01:13:21,405 --> 01:13:25,255
Speaker 3:  like, well we can't make a watch, right?

1315
01:13:25,255 --> 01:13:28,695
Speaker 3:  Like no one's gonna buy a smart watch that isn't an Apple or a Google or

1316
01:13:28,695 --> 01:13:32,535
Speaker 3:  a Samsung ecosystem device. So we're gonna mount a computer

1317
01:13:32,555 --> 01:13:35,455
Speaker 3:  to your face. Here's a bunch of face stuff.

1318
01:13:36,175 --> 01:13:39,615
Speaker 9:  I mean the number one problem with the face stuff is that we are

1319
01:13:39,955 --> 01:13:43,935
Speaker 9:  so vain as a species. Like kids cry when they find out they have to

1320
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:46,575
Speaker 9:  wear glasses because oh my god, they have to wear glasses. If you're David

1321
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:49,655
Speaker 9:  who routinely tells me has 2020 vision, thanks

1322
01:13:49,655 --> 01:13:51,095
Speaker 4:  David. People say I have the best vision.

1323
01:13:51,325 --> 01:13:53,455
Speaker 9:  Okay. People, people say, say that. Say that. David has the best, many

1324
01:13:53,455 --> 01:13:54,495
Speaker 3:  People have, lot of people say

1325
01:13:54,495 --> 01:13:57,255
Speaker 9:  That say like, why would you wear glasses? Right. Unless there's a function

1326
01:13:57,255 --> 01:13:58,095
Speaker 9:  for it. You're just, I would

1327
01:13:58,095 --> 01:13:59,015
Speaker 3:  Like people to know that

1328
01:13:59,015 --> 01:14:02,255
Speaker 4:  I don't need glasses. Yeah. Like I want the opposite of glasses.

1329
01:14:02,425 --> 01:14:06,215
Speaker 9:  Right? But if you're like me and you're basically a blind bat, and If you

1330
01:14:06,215 --> 01:14:09,975
Speaker 9:  look at my phone, the text is so large, you know,

1331
01:14:09,975 --> 01:14:13,285
Speaker 9:  you're used to wearing glasses and so then it becomes more functional because

1332
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:16,125
Speaker 9:  it's something you're already wearing. But that's, that's a huge problem.

1333
01:14:16,605 --> 01:14:19,125
Speaker 9:  Prescriptions are a huge problem if you're blind like me, negative nine.

1334
01:14:19,125 --> 01:14:22,645
Speaker 9:  Yeah, negative eight, huge astigmatism. Some of these glasses can't support

1335
01:14:22,665 --> 01:14:26,245
Speaker 9:  my actual thing. So then it's like, eh, you know, and

1336
01:14:26,445 --> 01:14:29,485
Speaker 9:  everyone's face is different. Everyone is aesthetic existent at different

1337
01:14:29,755 --> 01:14:33,085
Speaker 9:  mass producing these things. There's so many different challenges towards

1338
01:14:33,085 --> 01:14:36,845
Speaker 9:  smart glasses. So it's not like we're all gonna be wearing these tomorrow.

1339
01:14:37,145 --> 01:14:40,765
Speaker 9:  But I do think they've decided for whatever reason, yes, this is

1340
01:14:41,005 --> 01:14:44,765
Speaker 9:  possible. Throw everything at the wall, see what sticks, see what,

1341
01:14:44,765 --> 01:14:48,685
Speaker 9:  what is the way forward. And they all believe that it will converge

1342
01:14:48,705 --> 01:14:51,925
Speaker 9:  at this point where we have computers on our faces if we can.

1343
01:14:52,125 --> 01:14:54,725
Speaker 4:  I mean that's the CES story right there. That's the CES story. Like just

1344
01:14:54,725 --> 01:14:57,045
Speaker 4:  pick a thing that maybe will happen in a decade and let's try some weird

1345
01:14:57,045 --> 01:14:58,085
Speaker 4:  stuff about it. Yeah, yeah. Basically.

1346
01:14:58,245 --> 01:14:58,485
Speaker 9:  I love

1347
01:14:58,485 --> 01:14:59,045
Speaker 4:  That. That's,

1348
01:14:59,105 --> 01:15:03,045
Speaker 3:  That's, I'll remind you of course of my chart of whale bullshit. Do you know

1349
01:15:03,045 --> 01:15:07,005
Speaker 3:  about the chart? Two axes. One is utility and one is fids. And

1350
01:15:07,085 --> 01:15:10,405
Speaker 3:  you need to have vastly more utility than fids or your failure and

1351
01:15:11,035 --> 01:15:14,965
Speaker 3:  face is like a minus 500. I I propose If you put

1352
01:15:14,965 --> 01:15:16,565
Speaker 3:  something on your face, it has to be so useful.

1353
01:15:16,745 --> 01:15:20,285
Speaker 9:  It does, but I also propose that we actually visualize this graph and every

1354
01:15:20,285 --> 01:15:23,005
Speaker 9:  single time I do a wearable review, we have the graph in here.

1355
01:15:23,305 --> 01:15:24,605
Speaker 3:  We can do this, AI can do this for

1356
01:15:24,605 --> 01:15:26,165
Speaker 9:  Us, and AI can do this for us. And so, so

1357
01:15:26,225 --> 01:15:27,525
Speaker 3:  It will be lies, it will not

1358
01:15:27,525 --> 01:15:31,045
Speaker 9:  Be accurate. When, when I take briefings, I can go, okay, here's here's The

1359
01:15:31,165 --> 01:15:34,565
Speaker 9:  Verge approved graph. Please point to where on this graph your product is.

1360
01:15:34,995 --> 01:15:37,405
Speaker 9:  That would, that would make my life so much easier. I'm just saying

1361
01:15:37,625 --> 01:15:39,805
Speaker 3:  I'm correct about this. I think Joanna stole this in the journal recently,

1362
01:15:39,805 --> 01:15:43,605
Speaker 3:  so now we have to take it back. Let's putting out, okay, last thing I wanna

1363
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:44,885
Speaker 3:  talk to you about V and we should we, we

1364
01:15:44,885 --> 01:15:47,245
Speaker 4:  Have to quit. We've gone way over. We, we don't need to let these poor people

1365
01:15:47,245 --> 01:15:47,445
Speaker 4:  go.

1366
01:15:47,715 --> 01:15:48,005
Speaker 3:  Okay.

1367
01:15:48,195 --> 01:15:51,205
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And we can, we'll, we'll hang out after, but we gotta, let's end the

1368
01:15:51,205 --> 01:15:52,525
Speaker 4:  podcast and go hang out with these nice people.

1369
01:15:52,765 --> 01:15:54,405
Speaker 3:  I just wanted her to talk about Mariami for one second.

1370
01:15:54,585 --> 01:15:55,645
Speaker 4:  No, you can't. It's not

1371
01:15:55,645 --> 01:15:58,685
Speaker 3:  Allowed. There's a weird robots that just hugs you. It's like a hugging robot.

1372
01:15:59,025 --> 01:16:00,245
Speaker 3:  Go, go find the hugging robot.

1373
01:16:00,835 --> 01:16:03,325
Speaker 4:  It's cute. Go find the hooky robot. All right, here's the title of

01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:06,605
Speaker 3:  The episode. Thank you all for joining us. We have gone way over. It's wonderful

1376
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:13,085

1377
01:16:13,085 --> 01:16:15,965
Speaker 3:  alley screens. This whole time has been delightful for me. My ego is very

1378
01:16:15,965 --> 01:16:19,845
Speaker 3:  healthy. I appreciate all of you frame TV owners. We can get a drink in

1379
01:16:19,845 --> 01:16:22,525
Speaker 3:  a corner and really work through it. That's it. That's for cast rock and

1380
01:16:22,525 --> 01:16:22,645
Speaker 3:  roll.
