00:00:02,595 --> 00:00:06,325
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Anti glare

3
00:00:06,325 --> 00:00:10,045
Speaker 2:  coatings. I'm your friend David Pierce and I am doing my taxes.

4
00:00:10,515 --> 00:00:14,365
Speaker 2:  It's that time of year, my friends, the one time a year I need a

5
00:00:14,365 --> 00:00:18,365
Speaker 2:  printer. Mine is currently broken and suddenly I have to pretend that I understand

6
00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:22,245
Speaker 2:  a lot more than I actually do about like complicated financial

7
00:00:22,445 --> 00:00:26,245
Speaker 2:  documents. And honestly, most of all, this is the time of year that I

8
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:30,325
Speaker 2:  most wish I were more organized during the rest of the year so

9
00:00:30,325 --> 00:00:34,085
Speaker 2:  that this wasn't such a painful process. I have this like beautiful filing

10
00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:38,045
Speaker 2:  system that I never touch until right about now, and then I

11
00:00:38,185 --> 00:00:42,005
Speaker 2:  regret all of my life choices over the past 12 months, but I don't really

12
00:00:42,005 --> 00:00:45,685
Speaker 2:  see that dynamic changing anytime soon. So here we are. Anyway, we have

13
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:49,205
Speaker 2:  an awesome show for you today, but some quick housekeeping stuff before we

14
00:00:49,205 --> 00:00:52,965
Speaker 2:  get to that. First thing you'll notice, it's Tuesday and this episode is

15
00:00:52,965 --> 00:00:56,645
Speaker 2:  publishing. We are from now on going to be publishing The Vergecast on

16
00:00:56,645 --> 00:01:00,325
Speaker 2:  Tuesdays and Fridays. There are a bunch of reasons for that, but mostly

17
00:01:00,585 --> 00:01:04,565
Speaker 2:  it just lets us cover more stuff more quickly when we had to wait

18
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:07,725
Speaker 2:  until Wednesdays, it felt like we were doing a show and then really quickly

19
00:01:07,725 --> 00:01:10,885
Speaker 2:  doing another show and then not doing a show for a bunch of days. So this

20
00:01:10,885 --> 00:01:14,565
Speaker 2:  just kind of evenly spaces The Vergecast a little better. It'll let us be

21
00:01:14,565 --> 00:01:18,085
Speaker 2:  more on top of the news. It'll let us do all kinds of stories and it won't,

22
00:01:18,085 --> 00:01:21,485
Speaker 2:  you know, bunch our episodes up quite so much in your feed. Hope it's gonna

23
00:01:21,485 --> 00:01:24,565
Speaker 2:  be great. Hope it doesn't screw up any of your routines. Please let us know

24
00:01:24,565 --> 00:01:28,445
Speaker 2:  what you think. Also, we are gonna start having a full post on

25
00:01:28,445 --> 00:01:31,765
Speaker 2:  The Verge dot com with all of our show notes, a whole bunch of links, lots

26
00:01:31,765 --> 00:01:35,405
Speaker 2:  of information about every single episode we've heard all of you asking for

27
00:01:35,405 --> 00:01:38,245
Speaker 2:  better show notes and more links to stuff you can read about that we talk

28
00:01:38,245 --> 00:01:41,365
Speaker 2:  on the show. So we're just gonna start doing that at The Verge dot com slash

29
00:01:41,565 --> 00:01:44,405
Speaker 2:  Vergecast. You'll be able to find all of that every single time we publish

30
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:47,245
Speaker 2:  an episode. That's a great place to leave comments, tell us what you think

31
00:01:47,245 --> 00:01:50,925
Speaker 2:  of the episode. We're gonna try to do a good job of being in the comments

32
00:01:51,105 --> 00:01:54,925
Speaker 2:  and talking to you and we want to hear all the dumb things we say and all

33
00:01:54,925 --> 00:01:58,205
Speaker 2:  the times that you agree with me and not Eli, put it in the comments, tell

34
00:01:58,205 --> 00:02:01,725
Speaker 2:  us everything. We have lots more changes coming soon actually,

35
00:02:01,725 --> 00:02:05,445
Speaker 2:  especially on YouTube. So stay tuned. The Vergecast as a thing

36
00:02:05,745 --> 00:02:08,845
Speaker 2:  is not changing so don't worry. But we have little ways we think we can do

37
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:12,725
Speaker 2:  everything a little better and make it all more fun to watch

38
00:02:12,745 --> 00:02:16,325
Speaker 2:  and listen to and download and all that good stuff. So lots more coming.

39
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:20,045
Speaker 2:  Stay tuned. Alright, enough of that. Let's get to the show. The first thing

40
00:02:20,045 --> 00:02:23,405
Speaker 2:  we're gonna do today is we're gonna talk to Josh Miller, who is the CEO of

41
00:02:23,405 --> 00:02:27,005
Speaker 2:  a startup called the Browser Company, which is trying to basically nothing

42
00:02:27,055 --> 00:02:30,685
Speaker 2:  short of reinvent the web browser and do some big

43
00:02:31,065 --> 00:02:34,965
Speaker 2:  AI stuff and generally maybe change the internet forever. That

44
00:02:34,965 --> 00:02:38,325
Speaker 2:  all sounds big and ambitious, but it is big and ambitious and it's fascinating.

45
00:02:38,555 --> 00:02:42,365
Speaker 2:  Then we're gonna dig into all things Galaxy S 24 with Allison

46
00:02:42,365 --> 00:02:46,165
Speaker 2:  Johnson because it's only February and we might have already

47
00:02:46,235 --> 00:02:50,125
Speaker 2:  seen the most important Android phone of the year. All of that is coming

48
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:53,965
Speaker 2:  up in just a second. But first I have to go finish this one thing on this

49
00:02:53,985 --> 00:02:57,405
Speaker 2:  tax form, which is literally a form I've never heard of before.

50
00:02:57,595 --> 00:03:00,805
Speaker 2:  Hopefully this only takes a a minute. This is To Vergecast. We'll be right

51
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:00,965
Speaker 2:  back.

52
00:04:03,385 --> 00:04:07,195
Speaker 2:  Welcome back over the last couple of years, this browser called Arc

53
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:10,715
Speaker 2:  has become super popular. It's available on Mac and iOS, it's coming to Windows

54
00:04:10,745 --> 00:04:14,675
Speaker 2:  soon. People are super into it, which is weird honestly. I

55
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:18,235
Speaker 2:  mean when was the last time people got excited about a web browser, the

56
00:04:18,235 --> 00:04:20,995
Speaker 5:  New Netscape power and ease of use. It's

57
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:22,515
Speaker 5:  free@netscape.com

58
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:26,755
Speaker 2:  But Arc has some cool unusual ideas about how

59
00:04:26,755 --> 00:04:30,635
Speaker 2:  browsers should work and it's just so much nicer to use than Chrome

60
00:04:30,695 --> 00:04:34,155
Speaker 2:  or Edge. It's just caught on for a lot of people. As a result,

61
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:37,755
Speaker 2:  last week, the Browser company, which is the company that makes Arc released

62
00:04:37,915 --> 00:04:41,755
Speaker 2:  a new mobile app called Arc Search. It's a mobile browser and a pretty good

63
00:04:41,755 --> 00:04:45,635
Speaker 2:  one, but it's way more than that. It's also an AI tool called

64
00:04:45,775 --> 00:04:49,315
Speaker 2:  Browse. For me that is like a combination of search engine

65
00:04:49,975 --> 00:04:53,715
Speaker 2:  ai, chat bot, webpage maker and a bunch of other things.

66
00:04:54,225 --> 00:04:58,195
Speaker 2:  It's confusing to explain and frankly kind of hard. So let me just give you

67
00:04:58,195 --> 00:05:01,875
Speaker 2:  an example. Let's see the Grammys were the other day, So, I go into

68
00:05:02,015 --> 00:05:05,635
Speaker 2:  Arc Search on my phone and I say what happened at

69
00:05:05,895 --> 00:05:09,475
Speaker 2:  the Grammys on Sunday? And then I type that in and then I hit

70
00:05:09,535 --> 00:05:13,395
Speaker 2:  browse for me in Arc and it takes a second, it says it's reading

71
00:05:13,575 --> 00:05:17,195
Speaker 2:  six webpage, CBS news, New York Times, stuff like that. And then it pops

72
00:05:17,195 --> 00:05:21,155
Speaker 2:  up this page that says highlights of the 2024 Grammy Awards. This

73
00:05:21,315 --> 00:05:25,195
Speaker 2:  is a completely AI generated webpage. It has a bunch of things at

74
00:05:25,195 --> 00:05:28,755
Speaker 2:  the top like Killer Mike, the rapper was arrested,

75
00:05:29,005 --> 00:05:32,995
Speaker 2:  Taylor Swift won her fourth album of the year award Women

76
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:35,835
Speaker 2:  Dominated. There was a physical altercation apparently it just says that

77
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:39,555
Speaker 2:  at the top. And then it has some search results and then it has

78
00:05:39,555 --> 00:05:42,875
Speaker 2:  more information about Killer Mike being arrested. More information about

79
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:46,595
Speaker 2:  Taylor Swift's wins, more notable wins including

80
00:05:46,595 --> 00:05:50,275
Speaker 2:  Tracy Chapman who didn't win but performed a duet. This is the thing about

81
00:05:50,415 --> 00:05:53,995
Speaker 2:  ai, right? None of this is perfect, but anyway, it's this big long list of

82
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:57,845
Speaker 2:  information and links and media and videos to watch that is

83
00:05:57,845 --> 00:06:01,725
Speaker 2:  all completely AI generated. It is building a webpage for me

84
00:06:01,725 --> 00:06:05,205
Speaker 2:  every single time I search. It's neat and it doesn't always work as you can

85
00:06:05,205 --> 00:06:09,045
Speaker 2:  see and it's weird, like a lot of AI stuff is weird, but it also points

86
00:06:09,065 --> 00:06:12,085
Speaker 2:  at something really big about how the internet is changing. What does it

87
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:15,885
Speaker 2:  mean for the web that I can just get information like this? Arc

88
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:19,925
Speaker 2:  is essentially just Googling for me, which is handy, but it kind of

89
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:23,685
Speaker 2:  changes the whole dynamic of the internet. So I grabbed Josh Miller, the

90
00:06:23,685 --> 00:06:27,565
Speaker 2:  Browser company's CEO to talk all of that through what Arc wants to

91
00:06:27,565 --> 00:06:31,365
Speaker 2:  be, how it's gonna break the web apart and lots more. I've been talking to

92
00:06:31,365 --> 00:06:34,845
Speaker 2:  Josh for years. I find Arc really fascinating honestly, and

93
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:39,045
Speaker 2:  he's always had these really big ideas about what a browser could

94
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:42,685
Speaker 2:  be and also why he thinks a browser is worth building in the first place.

95
00:06:43,225 --> 00:06:47,085
Speaker 2:  And If you rewind four or five years ago, we're in this age back then

96
00:06:47,095 --> 00:06:51,085
Speaker 2:  where a couple of operating systems rule the world, right? Android, iOS,

97
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:54,365
Speaker 2:  windows, Mac, you wanna do anything interesting. You have to reckon with

98
00:06:54,365 --> 00:06:58,045
Speaker 2:  those oss and they are the ones that have the real control over how things

99
00:06:58,045 --> 00:07:01,885
Speaker 2:  work. But Josh had this inkling at the time that the web and

100
00:07:02,085 --> 00:07:04,645
Speaker 2:  specifically web-based apps were making a comeback.

101
00:07:05,535 --> 00:07:09,405
Speaker 6:  Figma notion, slack, even discord. These are all

102
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:13,365
Speaker 6:  just secretly web apps running in web browsers pretending they're not

103
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:17,005
Speaker 6:  web browsers. And so the foundational observation of the browser

104
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:20,805
Speaker 6:  company was, oh my goodness, the next operating system

105
00:07:20,945 --> 00:07:24,805
Speaker 6:  is right in front of our eyes. It's gonna look more like

106
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:28,165
Speaker 6:  a web Browser, it's gonna be a web browser design for the web because

107
00:07:28,355 --> 00:07:32,205
Speaker 6:  essentially to use a Wall Street term, the cloud

108
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:36,165
Speaker 6:  is underestimated and the shift to the cloud is underestimated. It is a

109
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:40,045
Speaker 6:  fundamental shift that we take for granted that all of the things

110
00:07:40,065 --> 00:07:43,245
Speaker 6:  in our life related technology are actually not in our lives anymore. They're

111
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:46,605
Speaker 6:  out on a server or many servers somewhere. And so the bet of the browser

112
00:07:46,605 --> 00:07:50,405
Speaker 6:  company was If. you reimagine the interface to those things, to

113
00:07:50,405 --> 00:07:53,925
Speaker 6:  the internet that would effectively become the most important operating system

114
00:07:53,945 --> 00:07:57,845
Speaker 6:  in our lives. And to be totally self-aware, that was kind of all we

115
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:58,405
Speaker 6:  had at the time.

116
00:07:59,065 --> 00:08:02,845
Speaker 2:  So that's the frame here, right? The web is the thing. It's as if the app

117
00:08:02,845 --> 00:08:06,805
Speaker 2:  store was already around in 2004 or 2005 or

118
00:08:06,965 --> 00:08:10,885
Speaker 2:  whatever and Apple went, huh, somebody should build an iPhone to run all

119
00:08:10,885 --> 00:08:14,805
Speaker 2:  these things that might be cool. It's exactly backwards in the most

120
00:08:15,045 --> 00:08:18,525
Speaker 2:  interesting way. That's ARC's big plan. And now with ai,

121
00:08:18,905 --> 00:08:22,725
Speaker 2:  Arc can do that more and bigger and faster, but

122
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:27,005
Speaker 2:  what is it trying to do and is what it's trying to do what we

123
00:08:27,035 --> 00:08:30,885
Speaker 2:  want both as users and like people on the internet. So that's where

124
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:34,445
Speaker 2:  Josh and I really got into it. I asked him, you know, you've been shouting

125
00:08:34,505 --> 00:08:38,445
Speaker 2:  all this nonsense about web browsers for years now and this new app,

126
00:08:38,545 --> 00:08:42,285
Speaker 2:  Arc Search feels like the closest thing yet to getting to that

127
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:46,245
Speaker 2:  idea about what an operating system can do to the web.

128
00:08:46,665 --> 00:08:50,125
Speaker 2:  So does this feel like you've finished, like you've done the thing?

129
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,805
Speaker 6:  The first thing I'll say is now I know you thought I was spewing nonsense

130
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,645
Speaker 6:  for these past few years that we've been friends.

131
00:08:55,925 --> 00:08:58,205
Speaker 2:  Listen, we're all spewing nonsense most of the time. It's okay,

132
00:08:58,215 --> 00:09:00,965
Speaker 6:  We're all spewing nonsense. That's true. Another thing people don't tell

133
00:09:00,965 --> 00:09:04,885
Speaker 6:  you when you're younger. Yes, but not for reasons. You may

134
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:08,365
Speaker 6:  think, okay, the reason that this new iPhone app,

135
00:09:08,745 --> 00:09:12,565
Speaker 6:  Arc Search feels like the truest representation of what we've been saying

136
00:09:12,665 --> 00:09:16,605
Speaker 6:  for many years. My dad has this phrase that he told me way too

137
00:09:16,605 --> 00:09:20,485
Speaker 6:  many times growing up, which is disregard the words. And the idea

138
00:09:20,485 --> 00:09:24,005
Speaker 6:  of this phrase is that we, we add these labels to things, these

139
00:09:24,255 --> 00:09:27,685
Speaker 6:  nouns and they gain all this cultural meaning to the point where

140
00:09:28,225 --> 00:09:31,885
Speaker 6:  we almost forget that they were made up. They don't actually mean they don't

141
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:36,085
Speaker 6:  represent the natural law. Yeah. And what we've been saying from

142
00:09:36,085 --> 00:09:40,045
Speaker 6:  the beginning and the reason that we use these phrases, the internet, computer

143
00:09:40,145 --> 00:09:43,805
Speaker 6:  and operating system for the web as imperfect as they were and as ambiguous

144
00:09:43,805 --> 00:09:46,805
Speaker 6:  as they were, is that we were trying to say is that If you approach

145
00:09:48,205 --> 00:09:51,765
Speaker 6:  software and interface it to the internet from a human perspective,

146
00:09:52,435 --> 00:09:56,405
Speaker 6:  what does David need to do today? What does David's wife have to get

147
00:09:56,405 --> 00:10:00,365
Speaker 6:  done today? Why are they turning to their computer? And you work backwards

148
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:04,205
Speaker 6:  from that. You probably don't need a thing called a web browser or

149
00:10:04,325 --> 00:10:08,165
Speaker 6:  a search engine or a webpage 'cause those are random nouns that

150
00:10:08,485 --> 00:10:12,405
Speaker 6:  were invented 25 years ago. The

151
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:16,045
Speaker 6:  reason that Arc Search represents in its purest form to date, our big

152
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,725
Speaker 6:  idea is that it's something different. It's something new,

153
00:10:19,955 --> 00:10:23,245
Speaker 6:  it's kind of hard to put a label on it. You struggled with it in your review.

154
00:10:23,545 --> 00:10:27,085
Speaker 6:  Is it a browser, is it a search engine? Is it ai, is it

155
00:10:27,245 --> 00:10:31,125
Speaker 6:  something else? And that makes me really excited because that

156
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,965
Speaker 6:  is what we were trying to do. We were trying to start with what does David

157
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:36,605
Speaker 6:  need to do when he is at the restaurant with a bunch of friends and they

158
00:10:36,605 --> 00:10:40,245
Speaker 6:  have a random question about something that comes up in conversation. Find

159
00:10:40,245 --> 00:10:43,805
Speaker 6:  the answer to that as quickly as possible and we should employ whatever tools

160
00:10:43,825 --> 00:10:47,485
Speaker 6:  and nouns and technologies we need to do that as quickly as possible.

161
00:10:47,945 --> 00:10:51,405
Speaker 6:  And yeah, turns out, ends up looking a little different than web browsers

162
00:10:51,405 --> 00:10:54,925
Speaker 6:  of 25 years ago and search engines of 25 years ago and web pages of

163
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:58,205
Speaker 6:  yesteryear. So that's what makes me so excited about Arc searches.

164
00:10:58,675 --> 00:11:02,565
Speaker 6:  It's a reminder to ourselves and everybody that hey, we can invent new

165
00:11:02,575 --> 00:11:06,085
Speaker 6:  nouns. And in fact if those new nouns are invented to solve

166
00:11:06,085 --> 00:11:09,925
Speaker 6:  problems and realize goals that we have, they might even

167
00:11:09,925 --> 00:11:13,125
Speaker 6:  be better than the old nouns. That's why I'm so excited about it and I'm,

168
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:17,285
Speaker 6:  one of our principles has always been the idea of a general purposed

169
00:11:17,305 --> 00:11:18,925
Speaker 6:  web browser is deeply flawed.

170
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,205
Speaker 2:  So you just brought up a bunch of things that I wanna talk about, but we've

171
00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:25,645
Speaker 2:  started to talk about the internet in a really different way than we used

172
00:11:25,645 --> 00:11:29,125
Speaker 2:  to. Where I think you could make the case that we

173
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:33,405
Speaker 2:  got the internet that we got, which I think by and large is a

174
00:11:33,405 --> 00:11:37,005
Speaker 2:  good version of the internet based on this like overall value

175
00:11:37,325 --> 00:11:40,725
Speaker 2:  exchange that everyone agreed on, right? Like Google came up because

176
00:11:40,985 --> 00:11:43,925
Speaker 2:  Google made a bet that what was good for the web would also be good for Google

177
00:11:43,985 --> 00:11:46,645
Speaker 2:  and set itself up as a company that would worked that way. And it worked

178
00:11:46,645 --> 00:11:49,565
Speaker 2:  that way for a really long time and it went super well for Google and I think

179
00:11:49,565 --> 00:11:52,765
Speaker 2:  largely went well for the internet. Facebook built on some of the same premises,

180
00:11:52,765 --> 00:11:56,005
Speaker 2:  right? Like there's this idea that I as a person on the internet am going

181
00:11:56,005 --> 00:11:59,605
Speaker 2:  to get value out of something. The people who make the tools that I use are

182
00:11:59,605 --> 00:12:03,245
Speaker 2:  also gonna get value that like everywhere along the way, if we can all find

183
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:07,125
Speaker 2:  win-wins the, it's gonna make the internet better. And I think with the

184
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:10,845
Speaker 2:  advent of ai, what it has come to is, okay, the internet exists,

185
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:15,125
Speaker 2:  it is now a thing to be mined for your benefit. And I think

186
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:18,885
Speaker 2:  the, the people who are mad at open AI and chat GPT and

187
00:12:19,025 --> 00:12:22,405
Speaker 2:  the the New York Times suing over the training data, there's this idea that

188
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:26,325
Speaker 2:  like, well we made things and you used to take those things but you would

189
00:12:26,335 --> 00:12:30,005
Speaker 2:  deliver value back to us and now you're just taking

190
00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:33,805
Speaker 2:  them because the, the idea is that the internet is just out there and everything

191
00:12:33,805 --> 00:12:36,805
Speaker 2:  that's out there is out there and you can just have it. And I think one of

192
00:12:36,805 --> 00:12:39,085
Speaker 2:  the things that I thought was really interesting about Arc Search is not

193
00:12:39,105 --> 00:12:41,885
Speaker 2:  only are you doing the LLM stuff, which I think is is interesting we should

194
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:44,845
Speaker 2:  talk about, but you're also, you're blocking ads by default. You're blocking

195
00:12:44,845 --> 00:12:47,205
Speaker 2:  trackers by default, you're blocking the cookie popups by default. That's

196
00:12:47,205 --> 00:12:50,685
Speaker 2:  a big series of I would say

197
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,925
Speaker 2:  potentially user-centric and maybe internet hostile

198
00:12:54,665 --> 00:12:58,125
Speaker 2:  set of things to do. You rely on the internet to work

199
00:12:58,585 --> 00:13:01,725
Speaker 2:  but you also are sort of tacitly agreeing that the way the internet works

200
00:13:01,995 --> 00:13:04,645
Speaker 2:  doesn't really work. Like how do you do both of those at the same time?

201
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:09,205
Speaker 6:  I think If, you look back at maybe what some people would say were

202
00:13:09,265 --> 00:13:13,205
Speaker 6:  the glory times for the early web when as you're alluding

203
00:13:13,205 --> 00:13:16,285
Speaker 6:  to maybe the incentives were better aligned and the value exchange was better

204
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:20,045
Speaker 6:  aligned. I personally remember Craigslist decimating the

205
00:13:20,245 --> 00:13:23,765
Speaker 6:  business models of the offline media companies and Yep. And especially in

206
00:13:23,765 --> 00:13:27,565
Speaker 6:  newspapers because of the innovations at this moment in time when we're talking

207
00:13:27,565 --> 00:13:31,445
Speaker 6:  about the value exchange being great, I actually order remember a lot

208
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:35,045
Speaker 6:  of second order negative externalities that came from the web at this glorious

209
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:35,925
Speaker 6:  moment. Yeah, that's

210
00:13:35,925 --> 00:13:36,165
Speaker 2:  A good point.

211
00:13:36,425 --> 00:13:40,325
Speaker 6:  My belief is that having worked at Facebook after selling my

212
00:13:40,325 --> 00:13:44,125
Speaker 6:  first company there is that anything that transforms

213
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:48,645
Speaker 6:  our world, again sociology major has very positive things

214
00:13:48,645 --> 00:13:52,605
Speaker 6:  that happen and has very negative things that happen, right? Airbnb is one

215
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:56,325
Speaker 6:  of my favorite products and experiences. It's ruining a lot of cities.

216
00:13:56,905 --> 00:14:00,805
Speaker 6:  The same is true for almost everything that changes how we

217
00:14:00,805 --> 00:14:04,685
Speaker 6:  live our lives as it relates to LLMs and AI and what

218
00:14:04,685 --> 00:14:08,525
Speaker 6:  you're alluding to in terms of its relationship to the exchange of value.

219
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:12,925
Speaker 6:  I think the same is true here. I think it is absolutely

220
00:14:12,925 --> 00:14:16,605
Speaker 6:  true that Arc Search and the fact that we remove the

221
00:14:16,635 --> 00:14:20,605
Speaker 6:  clutter and BS and make you faster and get you what you need with

222
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:24,525
Speaker 6:  a lot less time is objectively good for

223
00:14:24,525 --> 00:14:28,165
Speaker 6:  the vast majority of people. And it is also true.

224
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:32,565
Speaker 6:  It breaks something, it breaks a bit of the value exchange and not just Arc

225
00:14:32,565 --> 00:14:36,405
Speaker 6:  Search but all of these tools, yeah it's, it's at one level higher than Arc

226
00:14:36,405 --> 00:14:40,325
Speaker 6:  Search or chat GBT. We are grappling with a revolution

227
00:14:41,025 --> 00:14:44,645
Speaker 6:  in how software works and computers work and

228
00:14:44,785 --> 00:14:48,645
Speaker 6:  that's gonna mess some stuff up. And I totally agree with the premise

229
00:14:48,705 --> 00:14:52,675
Speaker 6:  of the question which is hey, something's breaking and it is really gonna

230
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:56,635
Speaker 6:  break soon. I a hundred percent agree So I think the answer is

231
00:14:57,395 --> 00:15:01,195
Speaker 6:  I think it will do more positive than negative. And I think it's kind of

232
00:15:01,475 --> 00:15:05,395
Speaker 6:  unbelievable how much of humanity's time has been wasted by how atrocious

233
00:15:05,395 --> 00:15:09,075
Speaker 6:  the mobile web is in support of the search ad business

234
00:15:09,085 --> 00:15:12,835
Speaker 6:  model. And we gotta figure out a better way to get content creators and

235
00:15:12,835 --> 00:15:16,755
Speaker 6:  publishers paid because it it, it's not gonna work and it's not

236
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:20,555
Speaker 6:  been working and it's not been working since Craigslist. So that is

237
00:15:20,555 --> 00:15:22,315
Speaker 6:  definitely a challenge for us all to grapple with.

238
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,995
Speaker 2:  I do think the one difference, and don don't wanna like dwell on philosophies

239
00:15:25,995 --> 00:15:28,715
Speaker 2:  of ai, but I think the one difference between the like Craigslist example,

240
00:15:28,715 --> 00:15:32,635
Speaker 2:  which is a really good one and this is that Craigslist built a better

241
00:15:32,635 --> 00:15:36,155
Speaker 2:  product than all of those things, right? Like and and I think what we're

242
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,955
Speaker 2:  learning about the media industry in particular is that the media industry

243
00:15:38,955 --> 00:15:42,595
Speaker 2:  spent a long time build building really crappy products and got eaten alive

244
00:15:42,615 --> 00:15:46,115
Speaker 2:  by better products. That just is what it is. And the next

245
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,115
Speaker 2:  reckoning is going to be like what does it look like for a media company

246
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:52,035
Speaker 2:  to build product? It's a thing we talk about all the time at The Verge. It's

247
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,795
Speaker 2:  like why we did the redesign of our website the way we did. It's like as

248
00:15:54,795 --> 00:15:57,915
Speaker 2:  we think about all of our future, it's as much about product as it is about

249
00:15:58,075 --> 00:16:01,795
Speaker 2:  anything else. And the difference between that and

250
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:05,715
Speaker 2:  what's happening now is that what's happening now with a lot of LLMs, one

251
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:09,395
Speaker 2:  way to look at it is it's as if Craigslist had taken

252
00:16:10,015 --> 00:16:13,835
Speaker 2:  all of the classifieds out of all of the existing newspapers and just posted

253
00:16:13,835 --> 00:16:16,275
Speaker 2:  them on the internet. And I think people would be like, well that's not a

254
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:19,835
Speaker 2:  better product that's you stealing from me and repackaging it in a new way.

255
00:16:19,835 --> 00:16:22,395
Speaker 2:  And I think that would've been a very different version of the conversation.

256
00:16:22,895 --> 00:16:26,595
Speaker 2:  And again, I think there is a lot of like society wide reckoning to do

257
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:30,675
Speaker 2:  about ai. There are a lot of people who are like, well the upside is so

258
00:16:30,705 --> 00:16:34,475
Speaker 2:  high that it's worth the, you know, investment

259
00:16:34,575 --> 00:16:38,235
Speaker 2:  of all of our stuff into it because we'll get more utility out of it.

260
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:42,035
Speaker 2:  But I just think like that fundamental question I don't think has precedent

261
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:45,315
Speaker 2:  on the internet because it's just never worked like this before and don don't

262
00:16:45,315 --> 00:16:48,035
Speaker 2:  think we have answers to it, which is gonna be fascinating and now you're

263
00:16:48,035 --> 00:16:49,435
Speaker 2:  right in the middle of it. So congratulations.

264
00:16:49,985 --> 00:16:53,595
Speaker 6:  It's really exciting to think about from a media company perspective,

265
00:16:54,265 --> 00:16:58,195
Speaker 6:  what is the superior product? What is that next evolution of

266
00:16:58,195 --> 00:17:02,115
Speaker 6:  media? And what I would say is candidly I have a

267
00:17:02,115 --> 00:17:05,395
Speaker 6:  deeper relationship with The Verge than I ever have before.

268
00:17:05,865 --> 00:17:09,635
Speaker 6:  I've been reading The Verge for over a decade now. I have never spent

269
00:17:09,635 --> 00:17:12,915
Speaker 6:  that much time and had that much depth with your, with your publication.

270
00:17:13,255 --> 00:17:17,195
Speaker 6:  Now I'm not saying that the economic incentives of your ad model with podcasts

271
00:17:17,195 --> 00:17:20,555
Speaker 6:  are working out, but that's all to say that in the same way that

272
00:17:21,135 --> 00:17:25,035
Speaker 6:  Arc can rethink our interface to the internet in

273
00:17:25,035 --> 00:17:28,755
Speaker 6:  a new way thanks to this technology, I think the answer probably lies

274
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:32,195
Speaker 6:  in the media industry and media companies rethinking what they do as well.

275
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:32,835
Speaker 6:  Sure.

276
00:17:32,895 --> 00:17:35,195
Speaker 2:  And I will say to your credit, one thing you have said to me many times over

277
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:39,155
Speaker 2:  the years is that there is a big phase of this for Arc

278
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:42,275
Speaker 2:  that is figurine out how to like be a good citizen of all of those things.

279
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:45,995
Speaker 6:  You see this in Arc Search by the way, which is here's what we could have

280
00:17:45,995 --> 00:17:49,565
Speaker 6:  done. You could have typed in a question to Arc Search and we could have

281
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:53,845
Speaker 6:  answered it and given ourselves all of the credit, right? Look

282
00:17:53,845 --> 00:17:57,765
Speaker 6:  at how smart Arc is. It's the smartest thing that ever existed.

283
00:17:58,425 --> 00:18:02,005
Speaker 6:  In fact what we do is we say extremely prominently

284
00:18:02,225 --> 00:18:05,205
Speaker 6:  we don't, we actually don't even let you do anything else until you read

285
00:18:05,205 --> 00:18:08,405
Speaker 6:  the fact that hey we are your browser.

286
00:18:09,225 --> 00:18:12,845
Speaker 6:  We are gonna go read these six websites, these six

287
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:16,565
Speaker 6:  websites and then we are gonna summarize a little bit about what each of

288
00:18:16,565 --> 00:18:20,245
Speaker 6:  those said and then we're gonna link to all of them. We're gonna link to

289
00:18:20,245 --> 00:18:24,125
Speaker 6:  them multiple times, we're even gonna verify a pull quote from them. And

290
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:28,085
Speaker 6:  so I think again, this change is inevitable. I

291
00:18:28,085 --> 00:18:31,525
Speaker 6:  think it's good for most people. I do think they're second order

292
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:35,685
Speaker 6:  externalities. I think it is the responsibility of folks like us to do

293
00:18:35,785 --> 00:18:39,565
Speaker 6:  our best with the role that we have to be good

294
00:18:39,845 --> 00:18:42,805
Speaker 6:  citizens and that's what we try to do here relative to other competing products

295
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:46,565
Speaker 6:  which I shouldn't name because I got Pr training but I don't think

296
00:18:46,565 --> 00:18:49,885
Speaker 6:  it's enough. And I think the answer to this question is one level higher

297
00:18:49,885 --> 00:18:53,365
Speaker 6:  than the browser company or Verge or anyone else. but it is absolutely something

298
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,205
Speaker 6:  we need to grapple with.

299
00:18:54,505 --> 00:18:58,125
Speaker 2:  So, I'm glad you brought up the UX of it all because I think how is an

300
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:02,245
Speaker 2:  AI tool supposed to look is my favorite question in the world right now.

301
00:19:02,345 --> 00:19:05,165
Speaker 2:  And I think people on this podcast are tired of hearing me rant about it.

302
00:19:05,505 --> 00:19:09,085
Speaker 2:  But the one thing I believe for sure is that a text box is not The future

303
00:19:09,085 --> 00:19:12,285
Speaker 2:  of the internet. But I'm curious, like the one thing I know about the browser

304
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:16,285
Speaker 2:  companies, you spend a lot of time prototyping, you spend a lot of time experimenting

305
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:19,965
Speaker 2:  and building stuff and you landed on Arc Search

306
00:19:20,145 --> 00:19:23,485
Speaker 2:  the way it is, which is an interesting mix of kind of what I would call,

307
00:19:23,515 --> 00:19:27,445
Speaker 2:  like there's media stuff at the top and then there's kind of a like

308
00:19:27,565 --> 00:19:30,405
Speaker 2:  bulleted summary and then there's a bunch of links and then there's more

309
00:19:30,405 --> 00:19:33,725
Speaker 2:  summary and then there's more links. Is that a, is that a fair description

310
00:19:33,725 --> 00:19:35,365
Speaker 2:  of, of the situation? The

311
00:19:35,365 --> 00:19:38,645
Speaker 6:  Two things that you're missing that I'm especially proud of is we embed YouTube

312
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:42,485
Speaker 6:  videos. True. So you can watch videos in line and then we embed

313
00:19:42,885 --> 00:19:46,845
Speaker 6:  verified quotes where we pull a quote from one of the articles and

314
00:19:46,845 --> 00:19:50,525
Speaker 6:  then we use AI and we say Hey ai, you

315
00:19:50,765 --> 00:19:54,725
Speaker 6:  actually make stuff up a lot so do us a favor this pull quote you told

316
00:19:54,725 --> 00:19:58,165
Speaker 6:  us you pulled, just go double check to make sure it's actually there. And

317
00:19:58,165 --> 00:20:01,685
Speaker 6:  then if it is, then we say hey, this quote's verified, we can show it. So

318
00:20:01,685 --> 00:20:04,285
Speaker 6:  those are two other interface innovations I'm especially proud of.

319
00:20:04,435 --> 00:20:08,205
Speaker 2:  Okay. So of all of the things you tried and thought about and played with,

320
00:20:08,305 --> 00:20:12,245
Speaker 2:  why did that feel like the right setup? I think we're, we're still

321
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:15,845
Speaker 2:  in this phase again of there are a million ways AI can

322
00:20:15,845 --> 00:20:19,805
Speaker 2:  present itself to you. Most of them right now are chatbots. What about this

323
00:20:19,805 --> 00:20:22,205
Speaker 2:  one stuck out to you as feeling right for Arc Search?

324
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:26,485
Speaker 6:  So as you mentioned we prototype a lot so we tried

325
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:30,765
Speaker 6:  50 variations of that experience before we landed on the exact

326
00:20:30,765 --> 00:20:34,645
Speaker 6:  one you see in Arc Search today. And in fact down to the tiniest details

327
00:20:34,715 --> 00:20:38,405
Speaker 6:  like do we show emojis as bullet points or do we just show bullet points?

328
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:40,765
Speaker 2:  You landed on emojis, which was the right call by the way.

329
00:20:40,775 --> 00:20:44,285
Speaker 6:  Thank you. Thank you. I take no credit for it. Shout out to Nate. The way

330
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:48,005
Speaker 6:  that we landed on it is I agree with what you said

331
00:20:48,095 --> 00:20:51,445
Speaker 6:  which is why does everyone think text boxes are like The future,

332
00:20:51,915 --> 00:20:55,045
Speaker 6:  there's gotta be something better. But I think the way that we approached

333
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:58,725
Speaker 6:  it was not, you know, hey should it be this or should it be that?

334
00:20:58,865 --> 00:21:02,085
Speaker 6:  We really try to approach it as hey let's write down

335
00:21:02,535 --> 00:21:06,165
Speaker 6:  throughout the week what are the things we look up on the go on our phone?

336
00:21:06,555 --> 00:21:10,125
Speaker 6:  Just quickly make a note of it and then let's go through all that stuff that

337
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,765
Speaker 6:  we turn to our computer in our pocket and our internet for

338
00:21:13,985 --> 00:21:17,325
Speaker 6:  on the go. What are the commonalities, what are the sort of things we wonder

339
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:21,285
Speaker 6:  about? Okay, great. Looks like I'm really bad at cooking and at the age

340
00:21:21,285 --> 00:21:24,965
Speaker 6:  of 33 I still don't know how to make couscous. That's

341
00:21:24,965 --> 00:21:28,845
Speaker 6:  problematic for a bunch of reasons. But if I need to know how to make couscous

342
00:21:28,905 --> 00:21:32,845
Speaker 6:  and I've got one hand 'cause my other hand is dirty and the water's

343
00:21:32,845 --> 00:21:36,725
Speaker 6:  boiling and I got other stuff to do, what is the fastest way we can

344
00:21:36,745 --> 00:21:40,485
Speaker 6:  get you the information for that job to be done and the others?

345
00:21:40,785 --> 00:21:44,565
Speaker 6:  And what you end up finding is it's not just a wall of text,

346
00:21:44,675 --> 00:21:48,405
Speaker 6:  it's not just photos, it's not just video, it's sort of a mixture of things

347
00:21:48,825 --> 00:21:52,765
Speaker 6:  but it's all grounded in not, hey let's go make a product that is a webpage

348
00:21:52,765 --> 00:21:56,685
Speaker 6:  or a text box or a a photo gallery. But we really try to do ground it in

349
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:59,685
Speaker 6:  what do you, what are you turning to this rectangle in your pocket for every

350
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:03,565
Speaker 6:  day and how can we craft a dynamic interface that

351
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:07,325
Speaker 6:  as best as possible tries to shapeshift itself to answer

352
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:11,165
Speaker 6:  exactly what you want. So what you'll notice is If, you ask Arc

353
00:22:11,165 --> 00:22:15,125
Speaker 6:  Search for how to cook couscous, you're actually gonna get back a a

354
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,925
Speaker 6:  very different experience than If. you asked it what is the meaning of

355
00:22:18,925 --> 00:22:20,925
Speaker 6:  life for example. Sure, sure.

356
00:22:20,955 --> 00:22:23,765
Speaker 2:  It's very telling to me that the phone was the centerpiece of that. 'cause

357
00:22:23,765 --> 00:22:27,445
Speaker 2:  one of the things I was gonna ask you is does this same paradigm make

358
00:22:27,445 --> 00:22:31,045
Speaker 2:  sense on a desktop browser? And I almost

359
00:22:31,095 --> 00:22:34,605
Speaker 2:  don't think that it does. one of the things you, you've always said to me,

360
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:37,845
Speaker 2:  which I think I mostly agree with is that most people don't want to use

361
00:22:38,165 --> 00:22:41,725
Speaker 2:  technology. They have a thing they'd like to get done and they use technology

362
00:22:41,725 --> 00:22:45,125
Speaker 2:  in service of that. They're not just like goofing around on their phone,

363
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:47,725
Speaker 2:  they mostly have like a a thing they'd like to do. And so your job is to

364
00:22:47,725 --> 00:22:50,605
Speaker 2:  help them do it faster. And I think if that's how you think about it, the

365
00:22:50,605 --> 00:22:54,045
Speaker 2:  way you put Arc Search together makes a lot of sense. But in in a world of

366
00:22:54,045 --> 00:22:57,685
Speaker 2:  like I am just sitting here and I wanna like

367
00:22:58,135 --> 00:23:01,805
Speaker 2:  learn as much about Machu Picchu as I can, the idea of

368
00:23:01,805 --> 00:23:04,845
Speaker 2:  delivering me what Arc Search is, which is sort of like a finished product

369
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:08,805
Speaker 2:  thing makes a lot less sense but that's also not what people do on their

370
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:12,365
Speaker 2:  phone. So like does this feel like a sort of truly mobile

371
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:16,445
Speaker 2:  centric and even maybe mobile specific way of solving this problem?

372
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:21,005
Speaker 6:  So three things. The first is you're absolutely right that which

373
00:23:21,005 --> 00:23:24,885
Speaker 6:  device you're on will radically change what it should and will

374
00:23:24,885 --> 00:23:28,405
Speaker 6:  look like in Arc. Okay. And so the sort of questions you're wondering at

375
00:23:28,405 --> 00:23:30,685
Speaker 6:  the bar when you're talking to your friend are different than when you're

376
00:23:30,685 --> 00:23:34,365
Speaker 6:  at your desktop on a Sunday trying to do some big research project

377
00:23:34,585 --> 00:23:38,045
Speaker 6:  for a big purchase. You and your wife are about to make fair. And so yes

378
00:23:38,265 --> 00:23:41,245
Speaker 6:  it will look very different on desktop because what you're trying to do is

379
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:44,765
Speaker 6:  very different. The second thing is the principle behind

380
00:23:45,345 --> 00:23:49,205
Speaker 6:  Arc Search, which is these artists formerly known as

381
00:23:49,225 --> 00:23:53,205
Speaker 6:  the web browser, the search engine and webpages are archaic

382
00:23:53,255 --> 00:23:57,085
Speaker 6:  ideas that should be merged and blended together into a

383
00:23:57,085 --> 00:24:00,805
Speaker 6:  new dynamic interface. Definitely applies on desktop and

384
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:04,565
Speaker 6:  definitely applies on mobile in other ways. Okay? And an example

385
00:24:04,585 --> 00:24:08,445
Speaker 6:  of that is on desktop, one of the features we just launched

386
00:24:08,985 --> 00:24:12,805
Speaker 6:  is something we call instant links. And instant links you can

387
00:24:12,805 --> 00:24:16,765
Speaker 6:  type in, you can hit new tab and on desktop in Arc

388
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:20,245
Speaker 6:  type videos of Steve Jobs unveiling the

389
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,805
Speaker 6:  iPhone iPod Macintosh and

390
00:24:24,435 --> 00:24:28,205
Speaker 6:  iPad and hit enter and Arc will go out and it'll

391
00:24:28,275 --> 00:24:31,885
Speaker 6:  grab a video of each of those Steve Jobs

392
00:24:31,885 --> 00:24:35,805
Speaker 6:  unveiling events and put it right in your browser. You skip the search engine

393
00:24:35,965 --> 00:24:39,765
Speaker 6:  altogether, right? That's the same idea, that's the exact same idea

394
00:24:40,025 --> 00:24:44,005
Speaker 6:  but tailor to the thing you were trying to do on that device in

395
00:24:44,005 --> 00:24:47,565
Speaker 6:  that moment. So that foundational principle of there's a new type of

396
00:24:47,805 --> 00:24:51,405
Speaker 6:  software, a browser that browses for you, that merges these three things.

397
00:24:52,105 --> 00:24:55,445
Speaker 6:  Is there, I think the final thing I'll note, which I think is more broadly

398
00:24:55,445 --> 00:24:58,605
Speaker 6:  applicable is If, you were to really reduce down

399
00:24:59,315 --> 00:25:03,205
Speaker 6:  this phrase ai, which also means kind of nothing correct and you

400
00:25:03,205 --> 00:25:07,125
Speaker 6:  were to ruse down, reduce down even large language models, which also

401
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:10,725
Speaker 6:  kind of doesn't mean anything just sounds fancier. Yeah this sounds really

402
00:25:10,855 --> 00:25:14,525
Speaker 6:  fancy and smart but don't ask me what So If you were to reduce

403
00:25:15,385 --> 00:25:18,965
Speaker 6:  AI and LLMs down to their essence and explain it to a five-year-old.

404
00:25:19,305 --> 00:25:23,245
Speaker 6:  The thing you would say is for the first time computers can read

405
00:25:24,185 --> 00:25:27,605
Speaker 6:  and if computers can read then they can understand,

406
00:25:27,895 --> 00:25:31,845
Speaker 6:  truly understand what you're asking them. And So I think really

407
00:25:31,845 --> 00:25:35,685
Speaker 6:  the underlying principle of what Arc is doing

408
00:25:36,115 --> 00:25:39,485
Speaker 6:  with this new category of software on mobile and desktop

409
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:43,645
Speaker 6:  is not actually even the output. That's not what's new.

410
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:47,325
Speaker 6:  Yeah, sure it will be new and that it'll be dynamic and it'll look and feel

411
00:25:47,365 --> 00:25:51,245
Speaker 6:  a little different. It's the idea that you can go to Arc on mobile or desktop

412
00:25:51,545 --> 00:25:54,965
Speaker 6:  and tell Arc what you're looking for and what you're trying to do.

413
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:59,485
Speaker 6:  And thanks to these large language models we can understand that for

414
00:25:59,485 --> 00:26:03,405
Speaker 6:  the first time and route you to the right place and route

415
00:26:03,405 --> 00:26:07,045
Speaker 6:  you to different things in different ways that wouldn't have been possible

416
00:26:07,045 --> 00:26:10,405
Speaker 6:  before. That's really what's the most different to me. And I think people

417
00:26:10,795 --> 00:26:14,765
Speaker 6:  fail to talk about that 'cause they tend to focus on, oh my god, it

418
00:26:14,765 --> 00:26:18,645
Speaker 6:  just wrote me a haiku about computers even that why would I need a haiku

419
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:22,285
Speaker 6:  about, I mean it is wild, but that is not, that's not really what's fundamentally

420
00:26:22,285 --> 00:26:25,085
Speaker 6:  new. It's the fact that our computers can read and think with us for the

421
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:29,045
Speaker 6:  first time. OpenAI has this product or this part of their API

422
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:32,805
Speaker 6:  called function calling and function calling is remarkable. What function

423
00:26:32,805 --> 00:26:36,245
Speaker 6:  calling is able to do is it's able to allow us to

424
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:40,405
Speaker 6:  take an input from a person like you saying what are the best

425
00:26:40,405 --> 00:26:43,885
Speaker 6:  iPhone chargers and then not only understand

426
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:48,045
Speaker 6:  what you're asking, but then based on its understanding, route it to

427
00:26:48,285 --> 00:26:52,085
Speaker 6:  specific places and to specific things that actually have nothing to do with

428
00:26:52,225 --> 00:26:56,125
Speaker 6:  ai. So one of the reasons that people including me many months ago

429
00:26:56,155 --> 00:27:00,045
Speaker 6:  were a little bit bearish in all this AI hype was I was just seeing

430
00:27:00,045 --> 00:27:03,605
Speaker 6:  these blobs of text outputted and assume that was ai.

431
00:27:04,225 --> 00:27:07,325
Speaker 6:  No, no, no. That was just one output. But thanks to function calling

432
00:27:08,025 --> 00:27:12,005
Speaker 6:  you can say, okay, if David is asking for videos

433
00:27:12,105 --> 00:27:16,005
Speaker 6:  of Steve Jobs unveiling the iPod, iPhone Macintosh, great. He's

434
00:27:16,005 --> 00:27:19,685
Speaker 6:  looking for these three videos. So go to YouTube and grab those videos. Hmm.

435
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:22,805
Speaker 6:  There's no hallucinating there. I mean again, it's gonna get it wrong. It's

436
00:27:22,805 --> 00:27:26,045
Speaker 6:  technology, it's as imperfect as we are. But that's actually

437
00:27:26,385 --> 00:27:30,365
Speaker 6:  wildly valuable and pretty unreal. Why isn't everyone talking about that?

438
00:27:30,365 --> 00:27:33,885
Speaker 6:  And it's 'cause we get caught up in these memes and these words that just

439
00:27:34,115 --> 00:27:38,045
Speaker 6:  mean everything and nothing to us. So function calling,

440
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:40,085
Speaker 6:  it's where it's at and there'll be more of those in The future.

441
00:27:40,385 --> 00:27:43,205
Speaker 2:  That's super interesting. Well and that's also just like

442
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:47,405
Speaker 2:  straightforwardly the thing that comes after search engines, right? Like

443
00:27:47,405 --> 00:27:51,085
Speaker 2:  you're in a certain way all that's doing is taking

444
00:27:51,475 --> 00:27:55,245
Speaker 2:  what would be a Google results page with a bunch of ads at the top and just

445
00:27:55,565 --> 00:27:59,485
Speaker 2:  skipping all of that. It's just saying, instead of me having to go

446
00:27:59,585 --> 00:28:02,165
Speaker 2:  say, where's this video and then click on the video and then watch the video

447
00:28:02,165 --> 00:28:06,045
Speaker 2:  and then save it to my sidebar, it's just putting those things in

448
00:28:06,145 --> 00:28:09,725
Speaker 2:  my sidebar, which in a funny way to me is like actually way more understandable

449
00:28:09,835 --> 00:28:13,725
Speaker 2:  than a lot of the AI stuff because one of the reactions to all of

450
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:17,325
Speaker 2:  these things is basically like actually Google's very good and

451
00:28:17,755 --> 00:28:21,445
Speaker 2:  it's very good at finding information and maybe we don't need to just completely

452
00:28:21,805 --> 00:28:24,965
Speaker 2:  reinvent this wheel with chatbots. And to a large extent, I'm actually really

453
00:28:24,965 --> 00:28:27,805
Speaker 2:  receptive to that argument. I think Google is a lot less good than it used

454
00:28:27,805 --> 00:28:30,205
Speaker 2:  to be, but it's still If. you wanna find a piece of information on the internet,

455
00:28:30,365 --> 00:28:34,165
Speaker 2:  Google's pretty damn good. But then the next step

456
00:28:34,415 --> 00:28:37,845
Speaker 2:  after Google alerting you to the existence of that information

457
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,965
Speaker 2:  is awful. And it's because web browsers suck. And this is like why I've always

458
00:28:41,965 --> 00:28:45,205
Speaker 2:  thought Arc is interesting. So you've just sort of backed your way towards

459
00:28:45,585 --> 00:28:49,125
Speaker 2:  the search engine and now you're, you're just like dis intermediating it

460
00:28:49,565 --> 00:28:50,445
Speaker 2:  entirely. I

461
00:28:50,445 --> 00:28:53,845
Speaker 6:  Agree. I think Google doesn't get enough credit for how it's innovated and

462
00:28:53,845 --> 00:28:57,565
Speaker 6:  pushed search forward and how actually wondrous search is, and

463
00:28:58,165 --> 00:29:01,085
Speaker 6:  I would push back on the idea that Google search gets us what we're looking

464
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:04,885
Speaker 6:  for because if aliens arrive tomorrow and they're like, look, I just read

465
00:29:04,885 --> 00:29:08,525
Speaker 6:  this great book, God Saved Texas by Lawrence Wright on the Spaceship Write

466
00:29:08,525 --> 00:29:12,365
Speaker 6:  over and I'm looking for a new book. And you went to Google and you

467
00:29:12,365 --> 00:29:16,205
Speaker 6:  typed in books similar to Gods Safe Texas by Lawrence Wright

468
00:29:16,425 --> 00:29:19,725
Speaker 6:  and then wow, magically so fast Google brought you what

469
00:29:20,165 --> 00:29:24,085
Speaker 6:  you wanted. Alien's like, oh wow. Are those books, well no, not quite.

470
00:29:24,085 --> 00:29:27,845
Speaker 6:  Those are called links and those links, yeah, yeah. Click on the

471
00:29:27,845 --> 00:29:30,245
Speaker 6:  link, the book's gonna be in there. Oh no. So these aren't books either.

472
00:29:30,245 --> 00:29:33,285
Speaker 6:  These are listicles and in the listicles are books and then If, you click

473
00:29:33,285 --> 00:29:36,925
Speaker 6:  on this other thing, those are books. So the truth is that

474
00:29:37,135 --> 00:29:40,365
Speaker 6:  there are these abstractions that we forget about, but

475
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:44,525
Speaker 6:  Google doesn't really bring on one hand to make it simple.

476
00:29:44,785 --> 00:29:48,285
Speaker 6:  Google brings you what you're asking for in the sense that it brings back

477
00:29:48,325 --> 00:29:51,365
Speaker 6:  a bunch of links and on the other hand, it doesn't bring you what you're

478
00:29:51,365 --> 00:29:54,365
Speaker 6:  asking for and that it makes you stop at Google first. And oftentimes the

479
00:29:54,365 --> 00:29:57,045
Speaker 6:  thing you're looking for are buried in a bunch of links in a bunch of links

480
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:01,005
Speaker 6:  behind that. And now we have the technology to say, let's just go straight

481
00:30:01,005 --> 00:30:04,165
Speaker 6:  to bringing you what you want and bring it right to you. That's a, that's

482
00:30:04,165 --> 00:30:08,045
Speaker 6:  a pretty big idea. And that's exactly how a human being wants it to

483
00:30:08,045 --> 00:30:08,165
Speaker 6:  work.

484
00:30:08,925 --> 00:30:12,045
Speaker 2:  I agree and disagree with that and the, I like, I'm glad you put it that

485
00:30:12,045 --> 00:30:15,285
Speaker 2:  way because I think one of the fun things we're going through right now because

486
00:30:15,285 --> 00:30:18,965
Speaker 2:  of AI is trying to figure out which

487
00:30:19,745 --> 00:30:23,485
Speaker 2:  new ideas are better enough to be worth unlearning decades

488
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:27,565
Speaker 2:  worth of habits and which aren't, right? Like I think about don don't

489
00:30:27,565 --> 00:30:31,405
Speaker 2:  know Siri and Google Assistant and Alexa, right? And the idea that voice

490
00:30:31,405 --> 00:30:34,205
Speaker 2:  is a much more natural interface for asking for information than typing on

491
00:30:34,205 --> 00:30:37,845
Speaker 2:  a keyboard unequivocally true. The tech wasn't very good and

492
00:30:37,915 --> 00:30:41,725
Speaker 2:  also people are not used to it. And so we all kind of were just like, well

493
00:30:41,725 --> 00:30:44,645
Speaker 2:  it's pretty easy to type on my phone, I'll just do that. Instead, I just

494
00:30:44,705 --> 00:30:47,525
Speaker 2:  was interviewing somebody for a future episode of the show about keyboard

495
00:30:47,635 --> 00:30:51,005
Speaker 2:  layouts and like, you know, what's better than wordy keyboard layouts is

496
00:30:51,005 --> 00:30:54,925
Speaker 2:  everything else, but good luck trying to convince people to not use Krty

497
00:30:55,245 --> 00:30:58,685
Speaker 2:  keyboards, right? So I think that question of can you build something that

498
00:30:58,705 --> 00:31:02,605
Speaker 2:  is so much better that it will actually make people

499
00:31:02,635 --> 00:31:06,325
Speaker 2:  make real behavioral change versus like, no it's,

500
00:31:06,515 --> 00:31:10,005
Speaker 2:  it's not the most human natural thing in the world that we all sort of learned

501
00:31:10,005 --> 00:31:13,845
Speaker 2:  how to type in what Google calls keyword ease. But I'm pretty

502
00:31:13,925 --> 00:31:17,285
Speaker 2:  good at it now. Like I, I can get what I want out of Google pretty

503
00:31:17,285 --> 00:31:20,845
Speaker 2:  successfully and so, you know, screw the aliens, what's it gonna take for

504
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:24,405
Speaker 2:  me to switch, I think is is very much the open question and this like path

505
00:31:24,405 --> 00:31:27,645
Speaker 2:  of AI over the next two years I think is really where we're gonna start to

506
00:31:27,645 --> 00:31:30,805
Speaker 2:  see where it does and doesn't clear the bar. And I think it's gonna be fascinating.

507
00:31:31,445 --> 00:31:35,125
Speaker 6:  I agree with you unless you're a web browser. Okay, and this is

508
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:38,845
Speaker 6:  exactly why we built a web browser. This is exactly why operating systems

509
00:31:39,435 --> 00:31:43,085
Speaker 6:  have so much leverage in how we use technology in that if I were to make

510
00:31:43,385 --> 00:31:47,245
Speaker 6:  an AI chat bot app called Chatty and it got really

511
00:31:47,245 --> 00:31:50,325
Speaker 6:  popular and wanted to radically change the way we get information,

512
00:31:51,145 --> 00:31:54,445
Speaker 6:  you gotta remember to go to that tab and as you said, you have this great

513
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:58,285
Speaker 6:  muscle memory. you know, it may be chatty is better than Google, but

514
00:31:58,545 --> 00:32:02,445
Speaker 6:  you have to remember to instead of hitting new tab or command t, go

515
00:32:02,445 --> 00:32:05,685
Speaker 6:  to that chatty tab. Yep. That's really hard to your, it really is.

516
00:32:05,795 --> 00:32:06,085
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

517
00:32:06,115 --> 00:32:09,885
Speaker 6:  It's really hard if in fact you are the web

518
00:32:09,885 --> 00:32:13,765
Speaker 6:  Browser and you are the text box that people type into

519
00:32:13,785 --> 00:32:17,205
Speaker 6:  to go to Google, you don't need to change your behavior. Mm. Your behavior

520
00:32:17,485 --> 00:32:20,325
Speaker 6:  actually doesn't happen in Google. Google's just a tab two. Everyone forgets

521
00:32:20,325 --> 00:32:23,845
Speaker 6:  that it's actually the browser that is your interface to the web and is the

522
00:32:23,845 --> 00:32:27,805
Speaker 6:  Browser where your muscle memory is and then you might say, yeah, well If,

523
00:32:27,885 --> 00:32:31,565
Speaker 6:  you send me to Chatty instead of Google. I'm still gonna be mad because I

524
00:32:31,565 --> 00:32:35,005
Speaker 6:  wanted Google because Chatty's not as good at all the searches. Well great

525
00:32:35,065 --> 00:32:38,885
Speaker 6:  thanks to function calling and thanks to ai we can know if you're

526
00:32:38,965 --> 00:32:42,925
Speaker 6:  asking us something that really Google's the best at or should what

527
00:32:42,925 --> 00:32:46,165
Speaker 6:  you send send you to Chatty or should we not send you anywhere? Should we

528
00:32:46,165 --> 00:32:49,685
Speaker 6:  just bring it to you? So one of the other features that we're launching on

529
00:32:50,305 --> 00:32:54,245
Speaker 6:  Arc for Mac is, I hate to admit it, I have

530
00:32:54,245 --> 00:32:57,965
Speaker 6:  an alert set up and not even alert at some regular

531
00:32:58,285 --> 00:33:01,485
Speaker 6:  interval. I go to Google and I type news about the Browser company or news

532
00:33:01,485 --> 00:33:05,045
Speaker 6:  about Arc Browser and I do that a lot. We have a new feature called live

533
00:33:05,045 --> 00:33:08,805
Speaker 6:  folders where whenever there's a new press story hopefully written by David

534
00:33:08,805 --> 00:33:12,445
Speaker 6:  Pierce and hopefully glowing about Arc, it'll just pop up in my

535
00:33:12,445 --> 00:33:16,405
Speaker 6:  sidebar. don don't even need to go to search. So again, because we're the

536
00:33:16,405 --> 00:33:19,325
Speaker 6:  web browser, you don't have to change ingrained behavior. We're just gonna

537
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:23,205
Speaker 6:  pop it up right in your sidebar. So yes, I think people underestimate

538
00:33:23,625 --> 00:33:27,445
Speaker 6:  how ingrained behaviors are and how hard it is to get people to change anything

539
00:33:27,445 --> 00:33:30,525
Speaker 6:  because at the end of the day they don't really care about technology and

540
00:33:30,525 --> 00:33:33,805
Speaker 6:  that is exactly why we built a web Browser. Everyone thought we,

541
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:37,085
Speaker 6:  why would you work on a desktop web browser? It could not be more boring.

542
00:33:37,635 --> 00:33:40,885
Speaker 6:  Well it's actually in, in fact because it's so boring that we wanna work

543
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:44,725
Speaker 6:  on it because you happen to use it for eight hours a day and so If, you use

544
00:33:44,725 --> 00:33:48,325
Speaker 6:  it for eight hours a day and you're all over this rectangle. If we place

545
00:33:48,325 --> 00:33:51,925
Speaker 6:  things in this rectangle or if we change where you go in the rectangle, when

546
00:33:51,925 --> 00:33:55,245
Speaker 6:  you type in something that's actually a great place to be to change

547
00:33:55,725 --> 00:33:59,205
Speaker 6:  entrench behavior without you having to change anything yourself, just

548
00:33:59,445 --> 00:34:03,205
Speaker 6:  abstracting that complexity. All we're proposing with Arc and this idea of

549
00:34:03,205 --> 00:34:07,045
Speaker 6:  a browser that browses for you is that we can then do

550
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,005
Speaker 6:  to Google what Google did to the web, Google and all these other applications

551
00:34:10,005 --> 00:34:13,885
Speaker 6:  we use, which is wow, there are now so many web apps open and

552
00:34:14,075 --> 00:34:17,885
Speaker 6:  tabs and Google Docs and all of these things. It's too much to reason

553
00:34:17,895 --> 00:34:20,885
Speaker 6:  about, I have to do 10 search queries just to find what I'm looking for.

554
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:25,285
Speaker 6:  It's time for a layer that sits above that which says, you tell us what you're

555
00:34:25,285 --> 00:34:29,125
Speaker 6:  trying to do and we'll go use the search engines and web apps and read the

556
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:32,885
Speaker 6:  articles for you. So that's the other thing that feels so exciting is it

557
00:34:32,885 --> 00:34:35,925
Speaker 6:  feels like a natural kind of march of progress toward

558
00:34:36,465 --> 00:34:40,445
Speaker 6:  making it your day easier and easier until one day you can

559
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:44,285
Speaker 6:  really just tell Arc or whatever software comes next what

560
00:34:44,285 --> 00:34:47,005
Speaker 6:  you're trying to do and it will go figure out what on the internet you want

561
00:34:47,005 --> 00:34:47,285
Speaker 6:  to use.

562
00:34:48,225 --> 00:34:52,085
Speaker 2:  If you're right, two companies come to mind that are sort

563
00:34:52,085 --> 00:34:56,045
Speaker 2:  of perfectly set up to do the vertically integrated thing

564
00:34:56,045 --> 00:35:00,005
Speaker 2:  you're describing, which are Google and Microsoft, like they're sitting on

565
00:35:00,025 --> 00:35:03,965
Speaker 2:  the whole tech stack more so than you are to do all of

566
00:35:03,965 --> 00:35:07,845
Speaker 2:  the things that you just described. Google has Google, Google has

567
00:35:07,845 --> 00:35:11,725
Speaker 2:  Chrome, Google has Gemini and all of its like all it has to do is like

568
00:35:11,725 --> 00:35:15,525
Speaker 2:  put three project managers in a room together and they could start to build

569
00:35:15,635 --> 00:35:19,325
Speaker 2:  something similar to what you're describing. Microsoft's the same with Bing

570
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:23,005
Speaker 2:  and all the open AI stuff and what's to prevent them from

571
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:26,725
Speaker 2:  doing this too. I think there's real energy in the browser space

572
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:30,245
Speaker 2:  because of this for the first time and right now so much of it is just like

573
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:33,685
Speaker 2:  we stick a chat bot or sidebar or some of the little

574
00:35:33,685 --> 00:35:36,325
Speaker 2:  organizational stuff like Google just launched a bunch of stuff in Chrome

575
00:35:36,325 --> 00:35:40,005
Speaker 2:  that is basically like less interesting feature rips of what

576
00:35:40,105 --> 00:35:43,685
Speaker 2:  Arc Max was doing a few months ago. But they with real

577
00:35:43,825 --> 00:35:47,485
Speaker 2:  energy and resources, they could out muscle you in pretty much every direction

578
00:35:47,485 --> 00:35:48,725
Speaker 2:  here if they chose to, right?

579
00:35:49,265 --> 00:35:52,725
Speaker 6:  You are absolutely right that I view our true competition

580
00:35:53,265 --> 00:35:57,205
Speaker 6:  as Microsoft, Google, and Apple. Sure. I actually

581
00:35:57,205 --> 00:36:01,085
Speaker 6:  think Apple is the one that is in the best position to do this and

582
00:36:01,085 --> 00:36:04,285
Speaker 6:  they're all trillion dollar companies with everything.

583
00:36:05,545 --> 00:36:09,525
Speaker 6:  Of course that is terrifying. And of course that is gonna be

584
00:36:09,765 --> 00:36:13,485
Speaker 6:  a big challenge. you know there's this famous story about Google Chrome

585
00:36:13,485 --> 00:36:17,085
Speaker 6:  where when you open a new tab, you see the new tab page,

586
00:36:17,465 --> 00:36:20,725
Speaker 6:  it shows you a tile of your most frequently visited sites

587
00:36:21,465 --> 00:36:25,085
Speaker 6:  and the way that they used to show those tiles were with screenshots, you

588
00:36:25,085 --> 00:36:29,005
Speaker 6:  know, a picture of the webpage and then this PM had this idea, you know,

589
00:36:29,005 --> 00:36:32,845
Speaker 6:  it's actually much easier and faster to just show the logo

590
00:36:33,105 --> 00:36:37,045
Speaker 6:  of the website because people can more quickly identify, oh that

591
00:36:37,045 --> 00:36:40,965
Speaker 6:  tile is Twitter than it is to identify the screenshot. And that

592
00:36:41,025 --> 00:36:44,725
Speaker 6:  PM was right. It made it so much easier for people to quickly

593
00:36:44,795 --> 00:36:47,845
Speaker 6:  find what they were looking for by clicking on one of those tiles. There

594
00:36:47,845 --> 00:36:51,205
Speaker 6:  was a major freak out at Google because overnight

595
00:36:51,665 --> 00:36:55,605
Speaker 6:  ad revenue search ad revenue dropped by 5%, which is a

596
00:36:55,605 --> 00:36:59,565
Speaker 6:  huge deal at Google scale. Yeah, 5% red alert. What

597
00:36:59,845 --> 00:37:03,725
Speaker 6:  happened, what did we change? And it turned out that this pm making it easier

598
00:37:03,825 --> 00:37:07,485
Speaker 6:  for people to get what they needed faster in the web browser tanked

599
00:37:07,605 --> 00:37:11,445
Speaker 6:  Google's global ad revenue because when you click on a

600
00:37:11,445 --> 00:37:15,325
Speaker 6:  tile, you're not doing a Google search. So on paper, do

601
00:37:15,325 --> 00:37:19,245
Speaker 6:  Google and Microsoft have everything it takes? Yes.

602
00:37:19,825 --> 00:37:23,805
Speaker 6:  Is there a lot of structural challenges to big public companies with shareholder

603
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:27,885
Speaker 6:  pressures not to hurt the cash cow that is search ads? Yes,

604
00:37:28,435 --> 00:37:32,165
Speaker 6:  sure Can I remember the last time that Google and

605
00:37:32,485 --> 00:37:36,005
Speaker 6:  Microsoft invented something wildly new that

606
00:37:36,365 --> 00:37:39,965
Speaker 6:  revolutionized a category where nothing had come before it?

607
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:44,245
Speaker 6:  No. Is this time different? Potentially we're gonna pretend like we're

608
00:37:44,245 --> 00:37:47,605
Speaker 6:  competing with them in a really big way. Yeah, but I think that we're just

609
00:37:47,605 --> 00:37:51,405
Speaker 6:  gonna keep doing our thing and hope that they keep loving search ads. Fair

610
00:37:51,405 --> 00:37:54,405
Speaker 2:  Enough. So the the reason I would think in that way of thinking to be

611
00:37:55,115 --> 00:37:58,365
Speaker 2:  most curious about what Apple is up to is that it seems to have a lot of

612
00:37:58,365 --> 00:38:01,685
Speaker 2:  those same capabilities and less to lose

613
00:38:02,385 --> 00:38:06,365
Speaker 2:  as a search business essentially like safari. I

614
00:38:06,365 --> 00:38:09,285
Speaker 2:  mean the whole Google antitrust thing makes this very interesting with the

615
00:38:09,445 --> 00:38:13,405
Speaker 2:  safari ads deal that could get very complicated over time, but Apple

616
00:38:13,405 --> 00:38:16,925
Speaker 2:  seems to have a big, very successful, very popular browser that makes it

617
00:38:16,965 --> 00:38:20,885
Speaker 2:  a lot less, is a lot less important to its future as a company

618
00:38:21,315 --> 00:38:23,565
Speaker 2:  than say Chrome is to Google.

619
00:38:24,285 --> 00:38:27,365
Speaker 6:  I actually think you're putting a little too much emphasis on search. I think

620
00:38:27,365 --> 00:38:30,405
Speaker 6:  it's one or two levels higher than that. Okay. What we're really talking

621
00:38:30,405 --> 00:38:33,925
Speaker 6:  about is this idea, which by the way is not original to us, but the idea

622
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:37,885
Speaker 6:  is you tell Arc or you tell your interface to your computer or the internet

623
00:38:38,035 --> 00:38:41,685
Speaker 6:  what you're trying to do and then in this new world it will go

624
00:38:41,985 --> 00:38:45,485
Speaker 6:  use whatever tools and any information it needs to do it for you and bring

625
00:38:45,485 --> 00:38:48,525
Speaker 6:  it back to you. There's almost universal agreement that's how it's gonna

626
00:38:48,525 --> 00:38:52,205
Speaker 6:  work. And in order for that to work, you need three things. First

627
00:38:52,345 --> 00:38:56,165
Speaker 6:  you need a really rich data set about each individual,

628
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:59,285
Speaker 6:  everything that's going on in their personal life, professional life, what

629
00:38:59,285 --> 00:39:02,565
Speaker 6:  they type in text boxes, what they read on webpage, the documents that matter

630
00:39:02,565 --> 00:39:06,085
Speaker 6:  to their work. So you need, you need a unique data set about each individual.

631
00:39:06,505 --> 00:39:10,325
Speaker 6:  The second thing you need is you need the ability to manipulate

632
00:39:10,825 --> 00:39:14,765
Speaker 6:  all of the tools and the applications that people rely on to do what they

633
00:39:14,765 --> 00:39:17,685
Speaker 6:  do on their computers and on the internet said differently. You need them

634
00:39:17,685 --> 00:39:21,565
Speaker 6:  to be logged into the apps. Sure. The third thing that you need

635
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:25,805
Speaker 6:  is you need an interface. To your point about behavior change that

636
00:39:25,805 --> 00:39:28,925
Speaker 6:  people use all the time, all day, every day, they don't need to change anything

637
00:39:28,925 --> 00:39:32,685
Speaker 6:  they do, they just keep doing their thing and you can then

638
00:39:32,705 --> 00:39:35,805
Speaker 6:  go put The future in those places. You need those three things.

639
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:40,245
Speaker 6:  There are only two types of software that have

640
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:44,045
Speaker 6:  those three things. The first are operating systems, the second

641
00:39:44,065 --> 00:39:48,005
Speaker 6:  are web browsers. I promise you there is no way that The future

642
00:39:48,315 --> 00:39:52,205
Speaker 6:  powered by AI will exist in anything other than an

643
00:39:52,205 --> 00:39:56,165
Speaker 6:  operating system or a web. Browser, So, I. The only thing that keeps me

644
00:39:56,165 --> 00:40:00,085
Speaker 6:  up at night are web browser companies and operating system companies because

645
00:40:00,205 --> 00:40:03,725
Speaker 6:  I think those are the only two type of companies that have a shot at reimagining

646
00:40:03,725 --> 00:40:05,525
Speaker 6:  our interface to the internet. So

647
00:40:05,715 --> 00:40:08,445
Speaker 2:  Last thing, and this is a question I've been meaning to ask you for several

648
00:40:08,445 --> 00:40:12,325
Speaker 2:  weeks now. Did you see the rabbit launch at CES? This little

649
00:40:12,745 --> 00:40:16,605
Speaker 2:  AI gadget thing? I saw that thing and I, after

650
00:40:16,675 --> 00:40:18,845
Speaker 2:  talking about a lot of the stuff that you and I have been talking about for

651
00:40:18,845 --> 00:40:20,845
Speaker 2:  a while and a lot of stuff you've been talking about now, I looked at that

652
00:40:20,845 --> 00:40:24,005
Speaker 2:  and I was like, okay, if, if Josh and the browser company had become a hardware

653
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:27,965
Speaker 2:  company, this is roughly what they would've gone after. The same idea

654
00:40:27,965 --> 00:40:31,725
Speaker 2:  of like, okay, if the goal is to have these tools accomplish

655
00:40:31,725 --> 00:40:35,205
Speaker 2:  something on your behalf, instead of building me like a nice web browser

656
00:40:35,205 --> 00:40:38,725
Speaker 2:  that I'm in all day, you would've built me like a fun teenage engineering

657
00:40:38,825 --> 00:40:42,645
Speaker 2:  gadget that I can press a button and talk to all day. Does that feel right

658
00:40:42,645 --> 00:40:44,285
Speaker 2:  to you? What did you make of what rabbit's up to?

659
00:40:44,895 --> 00:40:48,725
Speaker 6:  First of all, I love anyone that dares to dream

660
00:40:49,105 --> 00:40:52,685
Speaker 6:  and anyone that just goes for it and I love that energy.

661
00:40:52,755 --> 00:40:54,765
Speaker 2:  They are nothing if not going for it. That team,

662
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:59,045
Speaker 6:  I love anyone that stands up on a metaphorical stage and says, I'm

663
00:40:59,045 --> 00:41:02,165
Speaker 6:  excited. I think The future should work like this and I'm gonna dedicate

664
00:41:02,165 --> 00:41:04,925
Speaker 6:  my life to doing something really bold and different than what we're used

665
00:41:04,925 --> 00:41:08,805
Speaker 6:  to. So, I have a lot of respect for that. I also totally agree that

666
00:41:08,805 --> 00:41:12,765
Speaker 6:  The future is going to work like you telling your computer whether it's

667
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:16,485
Speaker 6:  Arc or Rabbit, what you wanna do and it should go do it for you and abstract

668
00:41:16,485 --> 00:41:20,005
Speaker 6:  that complexity. I think the one place where I personally

669
00:41:20,905 --> 00:41:24,405
Speaker 6:  see a slightly different future is I don't want

670
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:28,205
Speaker 6:  more gadgets in my life. Okay? I don't want more devices.

671
00:41:28,605 --> 00:41:32,045
Speaker 6:  I think the secular trend to the cloud and the secular

672
00:41:32,255 --> 00:41:35,805
Speaker 6:  trend toward our stuff, our digital stuff, being out on a server

673
00:41:35,805 --> 00:41:39,765
Speaker 6:  somewhere, whether it's an application or our data, is that we can actually

674
00:41:39,765 --> 00:41:43,325
Speaker 6:  kind of free ourselves from the machines. We can free ourself from the devices

675
00:41:43,515 --> 00:41:47,125
Speaker 6:  because they're everywhere. I was on a united flight last night, I was like,

676
00:41:47,185 --> 00:41:50,325
Speaker 6:  I'm not sure if the this, for the first time this seat in front of me could

677
00:41:50,485 --> 00:41:54,205
Speaker 6:  probably run the Vision Pro. It's like it's the computers are going everywhere

678
00:41:54,825 --> 00:41:58,565
Speaker 6:  and so what I'm really excited about is a world in which the computer

679
00:41:58,625 --> 00:42:02,365
Speaker 6:  and air quotes that you talk to, the place it has all of your data and stuff

680
00:42:02,985 --> 00:42:06,885
Speaker 6:  is not another new box I gotta put somewhere on my

681
00:42:06,885 --> 00:42:10,845
Speaker 6:  body, whether that's on my face or in my pocket or another button

682
00:42:11,005 --> 00:42:13,965
Speaker 6:  I gotta remember to press instead of that other button. But oh wait, that's

683
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:17,085
Speaker 6:  not the action button. That's the volume and screenshot. What I'm really

684
00:42:17,085 --> 00:42:20,765
Speaker 6:  excited about is the idea that your computing life just goes with you

685
00:42:20,765 --> 00:42:24,645
Speaker 6:  everywhere to every device. But I do think the rabbit is

686
00:42:24,885 --> 00:42:28,645
Speaker 6:  fascinating from a vision perspective and a boldness perspective and I probably

687
00:42:28,925 --> 00:42:32,885
Speaker 6:  have a lot more in common with whoever started that company than I do

688
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:35,605
Speaker 6:  with someone else that I shouldn't name.

689
00:42:36,675 --> 00:42:39,845
Speaker 2:  Fair enough. So what you just made me realize is that I've been talking about

690
00:42:40,105 --> 00:42:44,045
Speaker 2:  Arc in terms of Chrome for a really long time and I should have been talking

691
00:42:44,045 --> 00:42:46,445
Speaker 2:  about it in terms of Chrome OS for a really long time

692
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:49,245
Speaker 6:  Internet computer operating system for the web.

693
00:42:49,585 --> 00:42:51,965
Speaker 2:  But what you're describing, and you know one of the things you announced

694
00:42:52,115 --> 00:42:55,685
Speaker 2:  last week was this thing. Was it Arc anywhere the new syncing service

695
00:42:56,075 --> 00:42:58,885
Speaker 2:  that becomes very important, right? Because what you're essentially building

696
00:42:58,905 --> 00:43:02,405
Speaker 2:  me is not a piece of software that lives on my computer. You're building

697
00:43:02,405 --> 00:43:06,245
Speaker 2:  me a piece of software that lives everywhere that I can just sort of

698
00:43:06,265 --> 00:43:10,245
Speaker 2:  tap into in whatever way I need to, whenever I need to. And all

699
00:43:10,245 --> 00:43:13,885
Speaker 2:  of a sudden like Arc anywhere becomes the thing as much as

700
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:16,085
Speaker 2:  whatever it is on my device becomes the thing.

701
00:43:16,785 --> 00:43:20,565
Speaker 6:  Arc anywhere is the product. Arc anywhere is the computer. Okay,

702
00:43:20,565 --> 00:43:23,165
Speaker 2:  This all just clicked in my brain as you were talking. This is

703
00:43:23,165 --> 00:43:27,005
Speaker 6:  Why we have to talk more. It isn't today, I'm not don, don't wanna over promise.

704
00:43:27,145 --> 00:43:30,765
Speaker 6:  It is a cross platform sinking mechanism for getting your tabs wherever you

705
00:43:30,765 --> 00:43:34,565
Speaker 6:  need them. But right behind you on this recording you have a tv, it looks

706
00:43:34,565 --> 00:43:37,965
Speaker 6:  like a TV sitting up on a little nightstand. It's a

707
00:43:37,965 --> 00:43:40,205
Speaker 2:  Piece of crap. Never buy a Roku TV people. Well

708
00:43:40,205 --> 00:43:43,885
Speaker 6:  One day that piece of crap computer in five years will actually be a very

709
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:48,085
Speaker 6:  powerful computer. Just like the phone in our pocket is

710
00:43:48,085 --> 00:43:51,885
Speaker 6:  a much more powerful computer than it was a decade ago. And so the idea of

711
00:43:51,985 --> 00:43:55,285
Speaker 6:  Arc and Arc anywhere is that one day when you're sitting on that couch behind

712
00:43:55,285 --> 00:43:58,165
Speaker 6:  you, looking at that screen you're looking at, which is now as powerful as

713
00:43:58,165 --> 00:44:02,125
Speaker 6:  the iPhone in your pocket, you should just be able to toss at

714
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:06,045
Speaker 6:  a glance and authenticate that it's you. And then you're in air

715
00:44:06,045 --> 00:44:09,685
Speaker 6:  quotes, computer, all of your apps and data and conversations and people

716
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:13,725
Speaker 6:  should appear on that screen. That is the whole idea of Arc.

717
00:44:13,835 --> 00:44:17,605
Speaker 6:  That is the idea of this next wave is that your computer is just an

718
00:44:17,705 --> 00:44:21,605
Speaker 6:  old noun for saying the stuff that matters in your digital life

719
00:44:21,605 --> 00:44:25,245
Speaker 6:  that is yours. And that should go with you anywhere, on any screen, on any

720
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:29,205
Speaker 6:  device and the way that you, it should interface with it in The future is

721
00:44:29,205 --> 00:44:33,165
Speaker 6:  not opening seven applications and 19 search query tabs and 27

722
00:44:33,165 --> 00:44:36,965
Speaker 6:  listicles. You should just tell the device in your life through Arc,

723
00:44:37,265 --> 00:44:39,965
Speaker 6:  here's what I'm trying to do and it should bring it to you. It should be

724
00:44:39,965 --> 00:44:43,765
Speaker 6:  a a browser that browses for you or a better tagline. 'cause I don't love

725
00:44:43,765 --> 00:44:45,845
Speaker 6:  that tagline, but it feels weird to invent your own noun.

726
00:44:48,155 --> 00:44:50,685
Speaker 7:  Alright, we gotta take a break and then we're gonna

727
00:44:50,685 --> 00:44:52,765
Speaker 8:  Talk Samsung and we're gonna talk galaxies.

728
00:44:53,015 --> 00:44:53,725
Speaker 7:  We'll be right back.

729
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:43,445
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. It's been a couple of weeks now since Samsung launched.

730
00:48:43,705 --> 00:48:47,405
Speaker 2:  Its new devices, the Galaxy, S 24, S 24 plus, and S 24

731
00:48:47,455 --> 00:48:51,245
Speaker 2:  Ultra, which means the Verges Allison. Johnson has had time to put

732
00:48:51,425 --> 00:48:54,845
Speaker 2:  all three of those phones through their paces and she's published their reviews.

733
00:48:54,845 --> 00:48:58,165
Speaker 2:  They're on The Verge dot com. Put 'em in the show notes and like I said,

734
00:48:58,395 --> 00:49:01,845
Speaker 2:  post on the site with all the links you need. It's wild to think that it

735
00:49:01,845 --> 00:49:05,725
Speaker 2:  is only the first week of February and we might have already seen the

736
00:49:05,725 --> 00:49:09,445
Speaker 2:  best Android phone of 2024, but I think that might be the case.

737
00:49:09,835 --> 00:49:13,605
Speaker 2:  Samsung as always, has done some of its usual upgrades here with

738
00:49:13,605 --> 00:49:16,845
Speaker 2:  better screens and some design tweaks and a little bit of new camera hardware.

739
00:49:17,145 --> 00:49:20,925
Speaker 2:  But most of what's new here is ai. There is so,

740
00:49:21,465 --> 00:49:25,245
Speaker 2:  so, so much AI in these phones, it's nuts. But

741
00:49:25,245 --> 00:49:28,965
Speaker 2:  does it add up to anything or is it all just another gimmick in

742
00:49:29,035 --> 00:49:32,565
Speaker 2:  Samsung's long, long line of phone gimmicks. Like I said,

743
00:49:32,565 --> 00:49:35,925
Speaker 2:  Allison has tried it all and she's here to answer that for us. Hi Allison.

744
00:49:36,455 --> 00:49:40,445
Speaker 2:  Hello. Welcome out of Samsung Chaos. This is very exciting for

745
00:49:40,445 --> 00:49:40,525
Speaker 2:  you.

746
00:49:40,735 --> 00:49:44,245
Speaker 13:  Thank you. It was a recent development so I'm happy to be here.

747
00:49:44,755 --> 00:49:47,925
Speaker 2:  This is a tough time because you basically had to take three different phones

748
00:49:48,275 --> 00:49:51,645
Speaker 2:  that are the same phone but different phones and try to figure out how to

749
00:49:51,645 --> 00:49:54,445
Speaker 2:  like make them make sense and also write something that is interesting to

750
00:49:54,445 --> 00:49:58,165
Speaker 2:  read about all of them, which is a difficult challenge.

751
00:49:58,715 --> 00:50:02,565
Speaker 13:  Yeah. And the same challenge as like most phones lately

752
00:50:02,655 --> 00:50:06,565
Speaker 13:  where the updates are just pretty incremental.

753
00:50:07,095 --> 00:50:10,925
Speaker 13:  Aside from Galaxy ai, which is a whole thing that you know we'll get

754
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:14,725
Speaker 13:  into, but it's just an interesting dynamic looking at it this year.

755
00:50:14,955 --> 00:50:18,885
Speaker 13:  Like the Ultra has always been the like we're just gonna throw everything

756
00:50:18,885 --> 00:50:22,645
Speaker 13:  in a phone. And for the past couple years that has been like,

757
00:50:22,955 --> 00:50:26,325
Speaker 13:  this is great, like you guys are killing it. And then the

758
00:50:26,745 --> 00:50:30,285
Speaker 13:  the regular ones, the s and S plus just sort of felt like

759
00:50:30,515 --> 00:50:34,325
Speaker 13:  they're good. They're a good alternative if you're like okay with

760
00:50:34,555 --> 00:50:38,245
Speaker 13:  Samsung's take on things and you want a really good Android phone.

761
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:41,645
Speaker 13:  Right. And that's sort of the case this year, but it's like slightly different.

762
00:50:41,995 --> 00:50:44,685
Speaker 2:  Okay. We're, we're about to spoil where I was going with all this, but I

763
00:50:44,685 --> 00:50:48,325
Speaker 2:  kind of think it's the opposite this year. Oh really? Like so the Ultra is

764
00:50:48,325 --> 00:50:51,645
Speaker 2:  still very much the kitchen sink phone. Like it is the Samsung

765
00:50:52,245 --> 00:50:55,525
Speaker 2:  iest of Samsung phones and I mean that both as a compliment and an insult

766
00:50:56,145 --> 00:51:00,085
Speaker 2:  as always with Samsung, but to me I got to the end of all

767
00:51:00,085 --> 00:51:03,565
Speaker 2:  your reviews and I was like okay, for the first time in a few years, I actually

768
00:51:03,885 --> 00:51:07,805
Speaker 2:  think the base Galaxy S 24 is the best

769
00:51:08,305 --> 00:51:12,005
Speaker 2:  Galaxy phone. Yeah. For most people right now. Which I don't feel like has

770
00:51:12,005 --> 00:51:15,925
Speaker 2:  been true for don. Don't know at least the last few years I feel like I would've

771
00:51:15,925 --> 00:51:19,805
Speaker 2:  always tried to talk people up and now I'm kind of like you

772
00:51:19,825 --> 00:51:23,125
Speaker 2:  get almost all the stuff in a slightly better size

773
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:27,565
Speaker 2:  for $799 instead of $1,299. Yeah.

774
00:51:27,715 --> 00:51:31,525
Speaker 2:  With the base model like big win for the base model this year. It

775
00:51:31,525 --> 00:51:35,165
Speaker 13:  Is, it's a big win for people who like smaller big phones

776
00:51:35,685 --> 00:51:37,005
Speaker 13:  'cause they're all big. They're

777
00:51:37,005 --> 00:51:37,285
Speaker 2:  All big.

778
00:51:37,555 --> 00:51:41,405
Speaker 13:  Yeah, no that sums up how I feel about them and I guess I

779
00:51:41,405 --> 00:51:45,205
Speaker 13:  think of like the Ultra just always kind of feels like it's

780
00:51:45,205 --> 00:51:49,005
Speaker 13:  in its own little atmosphere. It's like what

781
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:52,925
Speaker 13:  phone do you compare it to that has an spen and 12 cameras, you know?

782
00:51:53,205 --> 00:51:53,485
Speaker 13:  That's

783
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:53,765
Speaker 2:  Very true.

784
00:51:54,115 --> 00:51:57,725
Speaker 13:  It's kind of always felt to me like you sort of know if

785
00:51:57,745 --> 00:52:01,125
Speaker 13:  that's the thing you want and you want all that extra.

786
00:52:01,515 --> 00:52:05,445
Speaker 13:  Yeah. What feels different this year is that nothing on the

787
00:52:05,495 --> 00:52:09,365
Speaker 13:  Ultra just feels like, oh yeah, I totally see why this is worth the

788
00:52:09,375 --> 00:52:13,285
Speaker 13:  extra money because it is more money this year. It's 1299,

789
00:52:13,335 --> 00:52:17,005
Speaker 13:  which is a hundred dollars more than last year. And yeah,

790
00:52:17,265 --> 00:52:20,845
Speaker 13:  all of the exciting new features like air quotes,

791
00:52:20,905 --> 00:52:24,845
Speaker 13:  that's Samsung's words, the AI are on all

792
00:52:24,845 --> 00:52:28,485
Speaker 13:  three phones, like with no differences in how they

793
00:52:28,485 --> 00:52:32,165
Speaker 13:  perform or any of that. And this little phone, the regular S

794
00:52:32,165 --> 00:52:36,125
Speaker 13:  24 just feels like a good size and I'm happy it's here.

795
00:52:36,475 --> 00:52:36,765
Speaker 13:  Yeah.

796
00:52:37,105 --> 00:52:39,845
Speaker 2:  So, okay, let, let's talk through this a little bit because I think the first

797
00:52:39,845 --> 00:52:43,765
Speaker 2:  thing you pointed out to me right before we started recording is the actual

798
00:52:44,485 --> 00:52:48,245
Speaker 2:  physical object itself, which is again a thing I think that is sort of

799
00:52:48,245 --> 00:52:52,045
Speaker 2:  carried through all three versions of the phone. Correct me if

800
00:52:52,045 --> 00:52:55,925
Speaker 2:  I'm wrong, but they made this thing what seems to be a little, it's a little

801
00:52:55,925 --> 00:52:59,885
Speaker 2:  nicer. It's, it's nicer to hold in the hand. Samsung has a long history

802
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:03,845
Speaker 2:  of making just the slipperiest phones on the face of the earth and and

803
00:53:03,845 --> 00:53:05,205
Speaker 2:  it seems like they solve some of that this time.

804
00:53:05,435 --> 00:53:08,605
Speaker 13:  Yeah, well Google took that crown away. Like pixel

805
00:53:09,385 --> 00:53:13,125
Speaker 13:  is the most slippery. It really is. Object. It should be studied by

806
00:53:13,485 --> 00:53:16,965
Speaker 13:  scientists. I don't understand it. Yeah, no like Samsung,

807
00:53:17,545 --> 00:53:20,885
Speaker 13:  the Ultra still has, it has the flat screen this year which like,

808
00:53:21,465 --> 00:53:25,325
Speaker 13:  yay you have an spen, you want a flat screen, you're like running the pen

809
00:53:25,325 --> 00:53:29,085
Speaker 13:  over the edge that stinks. Still has a little bit of that

810
00:53:29,635 --> 00:53:33,445
Speaker 13:  like note design, the S 24, the S 24

811
00:53:33,475 --> 00:53:37,005
Speaker 13:  plus they, I'm just gonna say it like they are just straight up

812
00:53:37,155 --> 00:53:40,725
Speaker 13:  iPhones and that's fine. Like they have the,

813
00:53:41,145 --> 00:53:44,885
Speaker 13:  the flat edges. The S 23 was still kind of a

814
00:53:44,885 --> 00:53:48,845
Speaker 13:  curved edge, still had kind of a, I don't really wanna call

815
00:53:48,845 --> 00:53:52,365
Speaker 13:  it a Samsung look, it had a different look to it. It's not like a

816
00:53:52,365 --> 00:53:55,925
Speaker 13:  drastically different change, but I find it more

817
00:53:55,925 --> 00:53:59,365
Speaker 13:  comfortable to hold when I go to pick it up off of the table. It doesn't

818
00:53:59,365 --> 00:54:03,285
Speaker 13:  like fly outta my hands. They look great, they feel great and I

819
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:07,205
Speaker 13:  think like why reinvent the shape of a phone? Just

820
00:54:07,225 --> 00:54:08,005
Speaker 13:  go with what works.

821
00:54:08,485 --> 00:54:11,885
Speaker 2:  I agree. I feel like the two things that have always driven me crazy about

822
00:54:11,885 --> 00:54:15,685
Speaker 2:  some of these designs are either I'm holding it in my hand and it kind of

823
00:54:15,715 --> 00:54:19,125
Speaker 2:  digs into your palm in a way that feels bad or,

824
00:54:20,065 --> 00:54:23,365
Speaker 2:  and this is really my true slipperiness test. I'm holding the phone in my

825
00:54:23,365 --> 00:54:27,205
Speaker 2:  hand and I go to put it in my pocket and there have been phones that

826
00:54:27,265 --> 00:54:30,245
Speaker 2:  in the motion of like moving it down to put it in my pocket, I have just

827
00:54:30,265 --> 00:54:33,565
Speaker 2:  thrown it onto the ground. Yeah. Like I don't even drop it. Like I slingshot

828
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:36,005
Speaker 2:  it out of my hand onto the ground. Yeah.

829
00:54:36,195 --> 00:54:37,645
Speaker 13:  With prejudice. Yeah. Right.

830
00:54:38,145 --> 00:54:42,045
Speaker 2:  And yeah and the pixel is maybe the worst at that. Yeah.

831
00:54:42,105 --> 00:54:45,565
Speaker 2:  In history. But that is like the, the iPhone is they, they found the right

832
00:54:46,025 --> 00:54:49,245
Speaker 2:  mix of like the flat edges and the sort of rounded corners and it just like,

833
00:54:49,245 --> 00:54:53,125
Speaker 2:  it feels like an object in a nice way And I, I'm, I'm glad that Samsung

834
00:54:53,185 --> 00:54:54,205
Speaker 2:  has landed in that same place.

835
00:54:54,715 --> 00:54:58,685
Speaker 13:  Yeah. My Galaxy brain take is that phones over the next year

836
00:54:58,785 --> 00:55:02,405
Speaker 13:  are just gonna converge on that design. Like the pixel nine leaks,

837
00:55:02,795 --> 00:55:06,525
Speaker 13:  have the flat edges like this is fine, let's just do it.

838
00:55:06,535 --> 00:55:08,325
Speaker 13:  Let's embrace it. We're gonna go there.

839
00:55:08,645 --> 00:55:11,965
Speaker 2:  I think that's for the best honestly. Yeah. It's like there was that phase

840
00:55:11,965 --> 00:55:15,125
Speaker 2:  with laptops where everybody was like, what if they did weird stuff

841
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:19,605
Speaker 2:  and they flipped around and moved to the left and we just moved the track

842
00:55:19,625 --> 00:55:22,165
Speaker 2:  pad over here and everybody was like, oh no, what if it just looked like

843
00:55:22,165 --> 00:55:25,365
Speaker 2:  a laptop and we worried about other things And that is, that is the correct

844
00:55:25,365 --> 00:55:25,685
Speaker 2:  answer.

845
00:55:25,795 --> 00:55:29,605
Speaker 13:  Yeah. Nobody's like, oh I wish my refrigerator looked cooler

846
00:55:29,745 --> 00:55:32,645
Speaker 13:  and different than other different, it was like you just wanna know where

847
00:55:32,645 --> 00:55:33,125
Speaker 13:  stuff is.

848
00:55:34,045 --> 00:55:37,565
Speaker 2:  A hundred percent. So my first question with all Samsung phones is

849
00:55:38,305 --> 00:55:41,965
Speaker 2:  how Samsung are these Samsung phones? And I will say too,

850
00:55:41,965 --> 00:55:45,765
Speaker 2:  Samsung's credit, it used to be horrific. Yeah. I used to tell people do

851
00:55:45,765 --> 00:55:49,205
Speaker 2:  not buy a Samsung phone because it will torture you with popups and

852
00:55:49,475 --> 00:55:53,045
Speaker 2:  duplicate apps and things you'll hate. And I no longer feel

853
00:55:53,205 --> 00:55:57,165
Speaker 2:  quite that strongly, but I still think one UI is a mess in

854
00:55:57,165 --> 00:56:00,605
Speaker 2:  certain ways. So how, how Samsung are these phones this year?

855
00:56:01,075 --> 00:56:04,965
Speaker 13:  They're like tolerably. Samsung. Okay. You do, there

856
00:56:04,965 --> 00:56:08,405
Speaker 13:  is the like list of stuff I go through when I'm setting up a Samsung phone

857
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:12,365
Speaker 13:  and it is much longer than any other phone I use.

858
00:56:12,425 --> 00:56:16,085
Speaker 13:  You have to sort the app drawer. So apps

859
00:56:16,265 --> 00:56:19,445
Speaker 13:  are alphabetical instead of just like nonsense order

860
00:56:19,885 --> 00:56:20,445
Speaker 2:  Sounds right.

861
00:56:20,515 --> 00:56:24,205
Speaker 13:  There's 10 million things in the quick menu

862
00:56:24,665 --> 00:56:28,445
Speaker 13:  settings. All that is still a reality. It's it's just like, and this is

863
00:56:28,445 --> 00:56:32,405
Speaker 13:  kind of where I keep landing with like Pixel versus Samsung is that

864
00:56:32,405 --> 00:56:35,445
Speaker 13:  you just kind of have to work for it a little harder with the Samsung. You

865
00:56:35,445 --> 00:56:39,085
Speaker 13:  put in the work ahead of time, you disable the popup notification

866
00:56:39,595 --> 00:56:43,525
Speaker 13:  like sell me a new Galaxy S series phone. Like I don't

867
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,965
Speaker 13:  need that. I'm using the new Galaxy S series phone.

868
00:56:46,115 --> 00:56:49,925
Speaker 2:  That was one of your best lines in the review is opening up a Galaxy S 24

869
00:56:49,925 --> 00:56:52,765
Speaker 2:  setting it up and getting a popup saying, have you heard about the new Galaxy

870
00:56:52,885 --> 00:56:56,165
Speaker 2:  S 24 every year It's like guys we're doing something wrong here every

871
00:56:56,165 --> 00:57:00,125
Speaker 13:  Year. I I treasure that popup. I'm like oh there it is.

872
00:57:00,475 --> 00:57:03,965
Speaker 13:  Yeah you can disable it. It's just If you

873
00:57:04,175 --> 00:57:08,085
Speaker 13:  don't it it comes for you. Yeah. You can get

874
00:57:08,085 --> 00:57:11,685
Speaker 13:  to a place where you can just live totally peacefully with it. Yeah. And

875
00:57:11,685 --> 00:57:15,165
Speaker 13:  it, it has very good things going for it. Another iPhone

876
00:57:15,315 --> 00:57:18,645
Speaker 13:  feature that they wisely stole

877
00:57:19,145 --> 00:57:22,885
Speaker 13:  is the always on display that the wallpaper just kind of dims.

878
00:57:23,585 --> 00:57:27,445
Speaker 13:  So you see that all the time but you get those widgets too. So you

879
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:31,245
Speaker 13:  have like your little calendar widget or the battery indicator

880
00:57:31,425 --> 00:57:34,845
Speaker 13:  or is it gonna rain in the next hour is like I love that I should gimme

881
00:57:34,865 --> 00:57:35,645
Speaker 13:  all the information.

882
00:57:36,525 --> 00:57:40,245
Speaker 2:  I think this is the thing about these phones that you are most

883
00:57:40,245 --> 00:57:43,605
Speaker 2:  wrong about. No, but that's okay. No, this is just personal purpose. I think

884
00:57:43,605 --> 00:57:47,445
Speaker 2:  the iPhones always on display is bad. Yeah. And just makes me

885
00:57:47,445 --> 00:57:49,445
Speaker 2:  think my phone is on and that's stupid.

886
00:57:49,745 --> 00:57:53,445
Speaker 13:  You're not alone. I hear that a lot. I'm gonna die on that hill. It's

887
00:57:53,445 --> 00:57:57,285
Speaker 2:  Listen, you know to each their own you're wrong and so is Samsung and

888
00:57:57,285 --> 00:58:00,885
Speaker 2:  that's fine. Okay. And so is Apple. I think the pixel got it right where

889
00:58:00,885 --> 00:58:03,565
Speaker 2:  it's just like I wanna know the time and like the little thing where the

890
00:58:03,565 --> 00:58:07,085
Speaker 2:  song is playing into that love that don't need any more than that and just

891
00:58:07,105 --> 00:58:09,605
Speaker 2:  the thing where it kind of seems like I turned the brightness all the way

892
00:58:09,605 --> 00:58:12,365
Speaker 2:  down on my phone is not an always on display

893
00:58:12,905 --> 00:58:16,245
Speaker 13:  And naturally there's a setting in the Samsung phone you can turn that right

894
00:58:16,265 --> 00:58:20,005
Speaker 13:  off with just the wallpaper parts so you can have a normal always on

895
00:58:20,005 --> 00:58:23,845
Speaker 13:  display. But I think that is kind of the basic difference between like

896
00:58:24,035 --> 00:58:27,965
Speaker 13:  Samsung's philosophy and Googles is like on the pixel you

897
00:58:27,965 --> 00:58:31,845
Speaker 13:  have at a glance and you don't, you don't need to go in and

898
00:58:31,845 --> 00:58:35,525
Speaker 13:  set up a bunch of widgets. It's just gonna tell you something on

899
00:58:35,635 --> 00:58:39,525
Speaker 13:  your home screen or on the lock screen like hey you got a calendar appointment

900
00:58:39,525 --> 00:58:43,485
Speaker 13:  coming up. Or it doesn't always nail it. Sometimes I'm like oh that

901
00:58:43,485 --> 00:58:46,885
Speaker 13:  would've been a useful thing to know but it's just kind of gonna do those

902
00:58:46,885 --> 00:58:50,685
Speaker 13:  things for you. And Samsung's like here are 10,000 settings

903
00:58:50,865 --> 00:58:53,845
Speaker 13:  you can mess with and you can get to a place where you get all

904
00:58:53,845 --> 00:58:57,685
Speaker 2:  That. I wish Samsung would dial in the balance of

905
00:58:57,685 --> 00:59:00,645
Speaker 2:  the defaults there a little more. But I've come to really appreciate over

906
00:59:00,645 --> 00:59:04,285
Speaker 2:  time, especially as Google has kind of worked down

907
00:59:04,285 --> 00:59:08,165
Speaker 2:  towards giving you less to do. Like part of the reason people like Android

908
00:59:08,825 --> 00:59:12,605
Speaker 2:  is because it is so much more customizable and Samsung to its credit

909
00:59:12,745 --> 00:59:16,405
Speaker 2:  is like listen, everything there is to do, we are going to give you

910
00:59:16,645 --> 00:59:19,285
Speaker 2:  a way to do. And I actually think to some extent that's the right approach.

911
00:59:19,405 --> 00:59:23,245
Speaker 2:  I wish it made better choices about how it initially sets up the

912
00:59:23,245 --> 00:59:27,205
Speaker 2:  phone. And I wish there were some things that were less duplicative. Like

913
00:59:27,245 --> 00:59:30,765
Speaker 2:  I think you mentioned that there are basically like three different augmented

914
00:59:30,765 --> 00:59:34,365
Speaker 2:  reality search products on this phone. Like that's bad. That's just bad user

915
00:59:34,365 --> 00:59:37,405
Speaker 2:  experience. Yeah. But I do appreciate the thing that Samsung is like, look,

916
00:59:37,505 --> 00:59:40,805
Speaker 2:  do you want there to be 650 things in the settings that you can touch?

917
00:59:41,345 --> 00:59:44,085
Speaker 2:  We have that for you. I seriously, I think it's, it's a good thing people

918
00:59:44,085 --> 00:59:45,765
Speaker 2:  like that about Android. I think it's the right thing.

919
00:59:45,955 --> 00:59:46,565
Speaker 13:  They deliver

920
00:59:46,565 --> 00:59:49,525
Speaker 2:  It. Yeah. There should just be a version of Samsung phones that is like when

921
00:59:49,525 --> 00:59:51,925
Speaker 2:  you set it up it's like do you wanna do this the easy way or the hard way?

922
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:53,565
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And and you can pick either one

923
00:59:53,755 --> 00:59:55,605
Speaker 13:  Like the easy button right? Yeah.

924
00:59:56,545 --> 00:59:59,565
Speaker 2:  So the thing on the Ultra that really jumped out to me, I have basically

925
00:59:59,585 --> 01:00:03,485
Speaker 2:  two Ultra specific questions. The first is the screen. And it seems like

926
01:00:03,625 --> 01:00:07,245
Speaker 2:  of the specs in the whole series, the biggest

927
01:00:07,435 --> 01:00:11,365
Speaker 2:  upgrade from the 24 and the 24 plus to the 24

928
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:14,845
Speaker 2:  Ultra might be this new display. Was that your takeaway?

929
01:00:15,265 --> 01:00:15,485
Speaker 2:  If

930
01:00:15,565 --> 01:00:19,445
Speaker 13:  I was putting my money down on these phones, that's what

931
01:00:19,445 --> 01:00:22,965
Speaker 13:  I would pay for. Okay. For the Ultra it has a new

932
01:00:22,965 --> 01:00:26,765
Speaker 13:  gorilla glass that is supposedly much more

933
01:00:26,765 --> 01:00:30,645
Speaker 13:  scratch resistant. I put my phone next to my keys. It's bad.

934
01:00:30,925 --> 01:00:34,885
Speaker 13:  I always get those little like hairline scratches without fail don

935
01:00:34,885 --> 01:00:38,725
Speaker 13:  don't have a single one on the Ultra and it's only been, it's a

936
01:00:38,725 --> 01:00:41,445
Speaker 13:  small sample size but so far so good. But

937
01:00:41,445 --> 01:00:45,245
Speaker 2:  You're pretty brutal on phones like your, your review period is not

938
01:00:45,435 --> 01:00:46,445
Speaker 2:  easy. Yeah,

939
01:00:46,805 --> 01:00:50,085
Speaker 13:  I don don't have a case. My kid will touch it. He's got like, you know,

940
01:00:50,085 --> 01:00:54,005
Speaker 13:  peanut butter on his fingers the works. So yeah, there's that

941
01:00:54,405 --> 01:00:58,205
Speaker 13:  which is promising and the anti glare coating

942
01:00:58,255 --> 01:01:02,205
Speaker 13:  which is just, it's a little bit like magic. Like it's not like some

943
01:01:02,205 --> 01:01:05,925
Speaker 13:  brand new technology. It's just literally an anti glare coating on the

944
01:01:06,015 --> 01:01:09,685
Speaker 13:  phone screen. But you hold it up against another phone outside

945
01:01:10,345 --> 01:01:14,325
Speaker 13:  and a the Ultra gets really bright so you have

946
01:01:14,325 --> 01:01:18,005
Speaker 13:  that working for you and it just cuts the glare

947
01:01:18,145 --> 01:01:21,485
Speaker 13:  way down and you can, you sort of prepare yourself to like

948
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:25,685
Speaker 13:  squint at the phone. When you look at it outside you're like, oh I can see

949
01:01:25,685 --> 01:01:29,485
Speaker 13:  this just flying. Like it's almost as good as just in my house.

950
01:01:29,835 --> 01:01:30,125
Speaker 13:  Yeah.

951
01:01:30,385 --> 01:01:34,285
Speaker 2:  That's huge. And I think glare is one of those things we've all gotten used

952
01:01:34,285 --> 01:01:36,765
Speaker 2:  to on our phones. Like I was thinking about this reading your reviews that

953
01:01:36,995 --> 01:01:39,925
Speaker 2:  I've gotten used to the thing now where you kind of learn how to block the

954
01:01:39,925 --> 01:01:43,325
Speaker 2:  sun with your body as you're using your phone. Yeah. And you, you sort of

955
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:46,565
Speaker 2:  keep it down here and you like le hunch over it. Yeah. To not have glare

956
01:01:46,865 --> 01:01:50,485
Speaker 2:  but once you don't notice it and like once it's gone

957
01:01:51,105 --> 01:01:54,285
Speaker 2:  that's a huge change. And it's like for especially things like taking pictures

958
01:01:54,385 --> 01:01:58,005
Speaker 2:  and If, you have to hold it at an angle and you, you're sort of looking down

959
01:01:58,505 --> 01:02:02,485
Speaker 2:  off axis at your phone. Like anti glare is a bigger deal than it

960
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:04,605
Speaker 2:  seems in a lot of ways I think. Which is pretty cool. Yeah.

961
01:02:04,925 --> 01:02:07,965
Speaker 13:  I liked it better than most of the AI features

962
01:02:09,005 --> 01:02:12,645
Speaker 2:  Honestly. We're gonna get to those in in one second. Yeah. But the other

963
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:16,445
Speaker 2:  thing that I'm curious about with the Ultra specifically is this Zoom

964
01:02:16,495 --> 01:02:20,285
Speaker 2:  trade off that Samsung made. They went from 10 x zoom

965
01:02:20,705 --> 01:02:24,685
Speaker 2:  on the lens and then it was digital zoom in between. So If you wanted it

966
01:02:24,685 --> 01:02:28,285
Speaker 2:  like five x it was digital zoom to the opposite where now it's a five x lens

967
01:02:28,665 --> 01:02:32,205
Speaker 2:  but you can digital zoom to 10 x. I'm deeply suspicious

968
01:02:32,545 --> 01:02:36,405
Speaker 2:  of this change because digital zoom is a lie that we tell

969
01:02:36,405 --> 01:02:40,165
Speaker 2:  ourselves it's just cropping. What did you find? Is this, is the, was this

970
01:02:40,165 --> 01:02:41,605
Speaker 2:  the right trade? Was this the wrong trade?

971
01:02:42,115 --> 01:02:45,765
Speaker 13:  Well the slightly less evil version of digital zoom

972
01:02:45,985 --> 01:02:49,605
Speaker 13:  is this like actual crop into the middle of the sensor that they're doing

973
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:53,565
Speaker 13:  and that's what's happening now at 10 XI

974
01:02:53,565 --> 01:02:56,805
Speaker 13:  was a big fan of the 10 x lens. I thought it was great. It was so much fun.

975
01:02:56,905 --> 01:03:00,885
Speaker 13:  So I was really kind of bummed to see it go. But the more I kind of

976
01:03:00,885 --> 01:03:04,765
Speaker 13:  sat with it, the more I get it, like five x is more,

977
01:03:05,315 --> 01:03:09,205
Speaker 13:  there's just more utility kind of in every day you can kind of take

978
01:03:09,325 --> 01:03:13,005
Speaker 13:  a portrait of someone if they're across the room, you're not taking

979
01:03:13,205 --> 01:03:15,565
Speaker 13:  a portrait with a 10 x lens. Like that's

980
01:03:15,565 --> 01:03:19,525
Speaker 2:  True. 10 x is kind of a party trick in a way that five x is like a

981
01:03:19,525 --> 01:03:21,085
Speaker 2:  thing you might do anyway.

982
01:03:21,085 --> 01:03:21,365
Speaker 13:  Exactly.

983
01:03:21,585 --> 01:03:22,285
Speaker 2:  That's interesting.

984
01:03:22,545 --> 01:03:26,245
Speaker 13:  And it's a higher resolution sensor. It's actually a little bigger

985
01:03:26,395 --> 01:03:30,125
Speaker 13:  than the old telephoto. All these things going for it. Samsung

986
01:03:30,265 --> 01:03:33,805
Speaker 13:  is like so don't worry that the quality at 10 x is like

987
01:03:34,245 --> 01:03:38,085
Speaker 13:  actually just fine And that's like kind of true If, you

988
01:03:38,085 --> 01:03:41,725
Speaker 13:  don't like iix peep. It's kind of a pointless

989
01:03:42,085 --> 01:03:45,685
Speaker 13:  exercise. But I, I go there and I think the detail

990
01:03:45,685 --> 01:03:49,485
Speaker 13:  captures about the same but you just see the where the little tiny

991
01:03:49,715 --> 01:03:53,125
Speaker 13:  lens falls apart. You're like ah that's there's a little chromatic

992
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:57,045
Speaker 13:  aberration. It's like that's in the 1% of like what

993
01:03:57,045 --> 01:04:00,965
Speaker 13:  anybody should care about. It is totally fine for just about

994
01:04:01,245 --> 01:04:02,405
Speaker 13:  anything else. So, and

995
01:04:02,445 --> 01:04:06,165
Speaker 2:  I suppose I can get behind the idea that you're trading really good 10 x

996
01:04:06,235 --> 01:04:10,125
Speaker 2:  zoom and mediocre five x zoom for really good five x zoom and

997
01:04:10,125 --> 01:04:14,045
Speaker 2:  mediocre 10 x zoom. Yeah. In real life that is probably a decent trade

998
01:04:14,245 --> 01:04:14,525
Speaker 2:  I suppose

999
01:04:14,905 --> 01:04:15,805
Speaker 13:  It makes sense. Yeah.

1000
01:04:15,835 --> 01:04:18,925
Speaker 2:  Okay. I just, they said they were like oh even at 10 x it'll look better

1001
01:04:19,085 --> 01:04:22,245
Speaker 2:  'cause it has more megapixels. And I was like I bet that's a lie. Yeah. And

1002
01:04:22,385 --> 01:04:23,725
Speaker 2:  I'm happy to know that it wasn't no

1003
01:04:23,785 --> 01:04:25,805
Speaker 13:  It wasn't quite just me to a better, yeah.

1004
01:04:26,145 --> 01:04:30,085
Speaker 2:  So okay let's talk about the AI stuff 'cause I think that's kind of the point

1005
01:04:30,085 --> 01:04:33,805
Speaker 2:  of these phones, right? And I think my sense of your

1006
01:04:34,025 --> 01:04:37,925
Speaker 2:  review was basically there's a ton of AI stuff here. You tested a

1007
01:04:37,925 --> 01:04:41,805
Speaker 2:  lot of it, but I'm curious like for you, not as a phone reviewer but

1008
01:04:41,805 --> 01:04:45,565
Speaker 2:  just as like a person who has a phone, what of these AI features

1009
01:04:46,615 --> 01:04:50,005
Speaker 2:  feels like it would actually be a thing you would use in everyday life? And

1010
01:04:50,005 --> 01:04:52,605
Speaker 2:  leave the camera out. We'll come back to the camera in a sec. Yeah. But of

1011
01:04:52,605 --> 01:04:56,125
Speaker 2:  the like there's the translation on a phone call, there's the recorder stuff,

1012
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:59,365
Speaker 2:  there's a bunch of other stuff like what feels like it actually could insert

1013
01:04:59,365 --> 01:05:00,325
Speaker 2:  itself into your life.

1014
01:05:00,865 --> 01:05:04,525
Speaker 13:  The thing I see as the most useful that I don't, don don't

1015
01:05:04,525 --> 01:05:07,765
Speaker 13:  currently have a use for it but it's kind of nice to know it was there is

1016
01:05:07,765 --> 01:05:11,685
Speaker 13:  the translation stuff. So that's where you call someone and you

1017
01:05:11,685 --> 01:05:15,285
Speaker 13:  can turn on this live translator and it'll just,

1018
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:19,605
Speaker 13:  you talk and it speaks for you and the other person and it translates back

1019
01:05:19,605 --> 01:05:23,125
Speaker 13:  and forth. I called the song our, our

1020
01:05:23,125 --> 01:05:26,805
Speaker 13:  wearables reviewer and she speaks Japanese and

1021
01:05:27,585 --> 01:05:31,205
Speaker 13:  her take on it was like, it gets the gist of it right? If your conversation

1022
01:05:31,205 --> 01:05:34,925
Speaker 13:  is like kind of transactional or you like I need to make a reservation or

1023
01:05:35,085 --> 01:05:38,685
Speaker 13:  whatever, sure gonna do those things fine. She tried to tell me her cat

1024
01:05:38,705 --> 01:05:42,325
Speaker 13:  was eating her chair and it said that she was eating the chair. It was

1025
01:05:42,635 --> 01:05:46,525
Speaker 13:  confusing. Very funny. But I think that's kind of

1026
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:50,365
Speaker 13:  where a lot of these AI features are. You're like, it's actually

1027
01:05:50,595 --> 01:05:54,365
Speaker 13:  more useful than not to have that there. As long as

1028
01:05:54,365 --> 01:05:58,325
Speaker 13:  you're not relying on it as like yeah this is gonna perfectly translate,

1029
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:02,645
Speaker 13:  you know, whatever I wanna say to this other person. Or you're not expecting,

1030
01:06:02,645 --> 01:06:06,205
Speaker 13:  like I want you to summarize a page of notes and you're just gonna

1031
01:06:06,205 --> 01:06:10,125
Speaker 13:  blindly be like, well my notes summary, my AI summary said this

1032
01:06:10,225 --> 01:06:13,845
Speaker 13:  so it must be true. Right. It's just kind of like a good starting point.

1033
01:06:14,145 --> 01:06:15,085
Speaker 13:  That's where I see it.

1034
01:06:15,315 --> 01:06:19,245
Speaker 2:  Yeah and I think with a lot of this stuff, the the sort of don't rely

1035
01:06:19,245 --> 01:06:22,965
Speaker 2:  on this too much. Footnote is a useful one but

1036
01:06:23,205 --> 01:06:25,845
Speaker 2:  I think you, you said at one point I, one of interview is like there's no

1037
01:06:25,845 --> 01:06:29,685
Speaker 2:  way in which this is worse than not having it. So So I'll take

1038
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:32,565
Speaker 2:  it. Yeah. Which is fair. And I think the challenge with some of these phones

1039
01:06:32,565 --> 01:06:36,205
Speaker 2:  for me now is Samsung wants you to buy these phones for the AI

1040
01:06:36,445 --> 01:06:39,165
Speaker 2:  features, right? And Google increasingly wants you to buy these phones for

1041
01:06:39,165 --> 01:06:43,085
Speaker 2:  the AI features. And I think on the camera, which we're gonna get to in just

1042
01:06:43,085 --> 01:06:46,205
Speaker 2:  a second, there are compelling cases to be made there that AI is letting

1043
01:06:46,205 --> 01:06:50,045
Speaker 2:  you do genuinely cool new, like worth getting this

1044
01:06:50,045 --> 01:06:53,725
Speaker 2:  phone over another phone sets of things. I don't know that I see any of that

1045
01:06:53,725 --> 01:06:57,005
Speaker 2:  here that it's like none of these strike me as

1046
01:06:57,685 --> 01:07:01,325
Speaker 2:  a tiebreaker over another device, if that makes sense. Like

1047
01:07:01,515 --> 01:07:04,525
Speaker 2:  nice to have. You'll probably use them if you're there. Like the, the recorder

1048
01:07:04,585 --> 01:07:07,885
Speaker 2:  is a cool thing and I've always loved a pixel recorder but I've never bought

1049
01:07:08,245 --> 01:07:11,605
Speaker 2:  a pixel because of the pixel recorder. Do you know what I mean? Does any

1050
01:07:11,605 --> 01:07:15,285
Speaker 2:  of the AI stuff feel like it clears that like this is why you would buy this

1051
01:07:15,285 --> 01:07:16,485
Speaker 2:  over something else bar?

1052
01:07:17,085 --> 01:07:20,685
Speaker 13:  I don't, I don't know if we're quite there. Okay. I think the, maybe with

1053
01:07:20,725 --> 01:07:24,685
Speaker 13:  a small asterisk for the pixel on the like face swap stuff, which

1054
01:07:24,685 --> 01:07:28,405
Speaker 13:  we all have, you know, feelings about. But that's the one that

1055
01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:32,605
Speaker 13:  people I talk to who are like not online, you know, are like,

1056
01:07:32,605 --> 01:07:36,445
Speaker 13:  oh I saw this pixel phone does this thing. I'm like, yeah actually

1057
01:07:36,515 --> 01:07:40,245
Speaker 13:  it's, it's really useful and like people see the utility for it. Yeah. There's

1058
01:07:40,245 --> 01:07:43,725
Speaker 13:  a lot of AI like camera and on-camera that I just sort of feel like,

1059
01:07:44,425 --> 01:07:48,165
Speaker 13:  is this helping it? Like is anyone gonna use this? Like the, especially

1060
01:07:48,225 --> 01:07:51,965
Speaker 13:  the chat assist stuff where it's like I'll write

1061
01:07:51,965 --> 01:07:55,925
Speaker 13:  something but you know, put some emoji in it or make it sound

1062
01:07:55,925 --> 01:07:59,805
Speaker 13:  professional or casual. Like I, I'll like write a text and

1063
01:07:59,805 --> 01:08:03,725
Speaker 13:  think to myself like should I use this? I'm like no

1064
01:08:04,965 --> 01:08:08,765
Speaker 13:  I have no reason to try it. Right. But the photo stuff is interesting.

1065
01:08:08,845 --> 01:08:11,965
Speaker 13:  I think it's, it's at a place where it's a little more compelling to people.

1066
01:08:12,345 --> 01:08:16,245
Speaker 13:  And Samsung's take on generative ai photo

1067
01:08:16,315 --> 01:08:18,045
Speaker 13:  editing is interesting.

1068
01:08:18,355 --> 01:08:21,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah. How compare and contrast it a bit to what the Pixel is doing. 'cause

1069
01:08:21,325 --> 01:08:24,925
Speaker 2:  the underlying models are, are mostly Googles, right? So in theory

1070
01:08:25,555 --> 01:08:28,285
Speaker 2:  it's, it's dealing with the same underlying technology but what is Samsung

1071
01:08:28,415 --> 01:08:30,725
Speaker 2:  doing differently from what we've seen on the pixels?

1072
01:08:31,115 --> 01:08:35,085
Speaker 13:  Yeah. So you kind of have the interface for the tools and

1073
01:08:35,085 --> 01:08:38,845
Speaker 13:  they're like very similar. You go into this separate kind of

1074
01:08:38,845 --> 01:08:42,725
Speaker 13:  editing pane of like you're doing AI and you can select

1075
01:08:42,745 --> 01:08:46,605
Speaker 13:  an object and move it or erase it. That's kind of the same

1076
01:08:46,625 --> 01:08:48,085
Speaker 13:  on Pixel and Samsung. I

1077
01:08:48,085 --> 01:08:50,925
Speaker 2:  Will say though, by the way, for anyone who has not yet read Allison's review

1078
01:08:50,945 --> 01:08:54,605
Speaker 2:  of the S 24 and S 24 plus, the funniest thing

1079
01:08:54,825 --> 01:08:58,645
Speaker 2:  in that whole review is a picture that you took, I think one of your, of

1080
01:08:58,645 --> 01:09:02,125
Speaker 2:  your husband's arm draped over a couch that you tried to remove. What, what

1081
01:09:02,285 --> 01:09:03,285
Speaker 2:  happened when you tried to remove this?

1082
01:09:03,625 --> 01:09:07,565
Speaker 13:  So yeah, I, I selected it and I hit, you know, take it out of the

1083
01:09:07,565 --> 01:09:11,285
Speaker 13:  scene. I did this on the pixel in the Samsung and the Pixel J

1084
01:09:11,355 --> 01:09:14,605
Speaker 13:  just kind of tried to like fill in the background. It was like there's a

1085
01:09:14,605 --> 01:09:18,485
Speaker 13:  couch here. Samsung was like, you want a new arm made out of pillows

1086
01:09:19,305 --> 01:09:23,085
Speaker 13:  and it just like creepiest frigging thing I've ever seen. Yeah.

1087
01:09:23,265 --> 01:09:27,165
Speaker 13:  And it's so cursed and it's now on the webs. It's on The Verge dot com forever.

1088
01:09:27,355 --> 01:09:27,645
Speaker 13:  It's

1089
01:09:27,645 --> 01:09:29,805
Speaker 2:  Good stuff. That's what we're here for. But anyway I derailed you. Sorry

1090
01:09:29,805 --> 01:09:30,165
Speaker 2:  keep going.

1091
01:09:30,355 --> 01:09:34,165
Speaker 13:  Yeah, no that kind of sums it up. 'cause like I think the pixel in like

1092
01:09:34,165 --> 01:09:37,885
Speaker 13:  what it'll actually generate and they are running on same

1093
01:09:37,885 --> 01:09:41,485
Speaker 13:  Google models, the pixel's a little more prone to be like, okay, you wanna

1094
01:09:41,595 --> 01:09:44,925
Speaker 13:  fill in the background here. It doesn't always look super great. Sometimes

1095
01:09:45,275 --> 01:09:49,245
Speaker 13:  it's really good, sometimes it's not. But the Samsung phone for

1096
01:09:49,485 --> 01:09:53,005
Speaker 13:  whatever reason is very eager to just like throw something else in there

1097
01:09:53,185 --> 01:09:55,365
Speaker 2:  That's such Samsung energy. I love it. It

1098
01:09:55,365 --> 01:09:59,085
Speaker 13:  Really is. Yeah. Like you, I selected a lamp on a

1099
01:09:59,245 --> 01:10:02,805
Speaker 13:  a table and I tried to take it out and it put a different lamp in. Like

1100
01:10:03,025 --> 01:10:05,365
Speaker 13:  that's not what I wanted at all. Like

1101
01:10:05,365 --> 01:10:07,725
Speaker 2:  It's like what's behind this in another lamp probably. Yeah. Let's see.

1102
01:10:08,315 --> 01:10:12,125
Speaker 13:  Just infinite layups like it's so strange.

1103
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:14,365
Speaker 13:  That's so good. Yeah, it's Samsung energy.

1104
01:10:14,745 --> 01:10:17,805
Speaker 2:  The one we talked a bunch about on To Vergecast when this launched was the

1105
01:10:18,085 --> 01:10:22,005
Speaker 2:  a ability to take any video and make it into a slow motion video and NELI

1106
01:10:22,005 --> 01:10:25,405
Speaker 2:  got like very in his feelings about how this is creating frames that don't

1107
01:10:25,405 --> 01:10:29,205
Speaker 2:  exist. What was your experience of actually using this thing in,

1108
01:10:29,345 --> 01:10:30,685
Speaker 2:  in life? How did it feel?

1109
01:10:31,225 --> 01:10:35,205
Speaker 13:  So I don't quite have the same philosophical hangup with it.

1110
01:10:35,625 --> 01:10:39,325
Speaker 13:  I'm like, okay sure. Let's, this is fun. I can slow down a video of my kid

1111
01:10:39,325 --> 01:10:40,405
Speaker 13:  on a swing. I think

1112
01:10:40,405 --> 01:10:43,885
Speaker 2:  That's where most people are. It's great. That's based on the emails we got

1113
01:10:43,885 --> 01:10:45,965
Speaker 2:  after that episode. I think most people agree with you

1114
01:10:46,415 --> 01:10:50,245
Speaker 13:  There. All that's the consensus. Yeah. When, so when we

1115
01:10:50,245 --> 01:10:54,205
Speaker 13:  tried it out just initially in the kind of product demo time, both vi

1116
01:10:54,425 --> 01:10:58,245
Speaker 13:  vi Veen and I were like, this is really impressive. Like it looks pretty

1117
01:10:58,245 --> 01:11:01,045
Speaker 13:  convincing and then you kind of throw more

1118
01:11:01,895 --> 01:11:05,445
Speaker 13:  complexity at it and it falls apart a lot of, a little bit. You can see

1119
01:11:05,445 --> 01:11:09,285
Speaker 13:  where it's like things sort of look jerky and the one I did was

1120
01:11:09,285 --> 01:11:12,925
Speaker 13:  like my kid on a swing and you know, he, he pulls him back and

1121
01:11:13,125 --> 01:11:16,805
Speaker 13:  lets him go and it's like so cute and he is just like

1122
01:11:17,235 --> 01:11:20,885
Speaker 13:  overjoyed but then his like the chains of the swing are just kind of like

1123
01:11:20,885 --> 01:11:22,765
Speaker 13:  flickering in and out of existence. Oh,

1124
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:23,325
Speaker 2:  Interesting.

1125
01:11:23,555 --> 01:11:27,405
Speaker 13:  Yeah. And like it's trying to decide what the, the mulch on the

1126
01:11:27,495 --> 01:11:31,045
Speaker 13:  playground should look like in every one of those frames where it doesn't

1127
01:11:31,045 --> 01:11:34,885
Speaker 13:  exist. So it just kinda like looks real warped and kind of,

1128
01:11:35,155 --> 01:11:36,565
Speaker 13:  it's a little distracting. Like

1129
01:11:36,705 --> 01:11:39,965
Speaker 2:  It makes the mulch looks like it's moving. Looking at the video. Yeah like,

1130
01:11:39,995 --> 01:11:42,605
Speaker 2:  like have you ever seen the thing where there's, there's just like a billion

1131
01:11:43,125 --> 01:11:46,165
Speaker 2:  ants altogether. It looks like sort of a solid thing but it's just like churning.

1132
01:11:46,275 --> 01:11:48,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's what it makes the mulch look like. It's a little unsettling

1133
01:11:49,325 --> 01:11:49,445
Speaker 2:  honestly.

1134
01:11:49,865 --> 01:11:53,765
Speaker 13:  It is. Yeah. It's, it's like take something very cute

1135
01:11:54,025 --> 01:11:57,285
Speaker 13:  and fun and makes it just a little like cursed.

1136
01:11:57,845 --> 01:12:01,245
Speaker 2:  Yeah. The one AI thing I forgot to ask you about was the circle to search

1137
01:12:01,245 --> 01:12:04,685
Speaker 2:  thing. And this is something that is not technically a Samsung only feature,

1138
01:12:05,075 --> 01:12:08,885
Speaker 2:  it's also on the pixel now and it's kind of, you can like hack your way

1139
01:12:08,885 --> 01:12:12,525
Speaker 2:  into something very similar just using Google's overall multi search stuff.

1140
01:12:13,145 --> 01:12:16,725
Speaker 2:  But I think this is very cool and strikes me as the kind of thing in general

1141
01:12:16,795 --> 01:12:20,445
Speaker 2:  that is like just a good feature. It's also a good reason to have an spen

1142
01:12:20,475 --> 01:12:24,045
Speaker 2:  like yay for the Ultra. Yeah. But you've tested this a bunch. I have not

1143
01:12:24,045 --> 01:12:27,085
Speaker 2:  been able to use it at all. What's been the, the verdict on circle of search?

1144
01:12:27,595 --> 01:12:31,165
Speaker 13:  Yeah, I think it's something that I am gonna miss when I don't have it.

1145
01:12:31,395 --> 01:12:35,125
Speaker 13:  It's not, it's not like you're constantly, I'm like oh I'm gonna circle

1146
01:12:35,125 --> 01:12:39,045
Speaker 13:  everything, search it in this Instagram post. But when you do need it

1147
01:12:39,225 --> 01:12:42,405
Speaker 13:  and you kind of have to unlearn the old way of doing things. Like I was

1148
01:12:42,405 --> 01:12:46,085
Speaker 13:  texting with a friend and they mentioned the name of the restaurant where

1149
01:12:46,085 --> 01:12:49,765
Speaker 13:  you're gonna meet at and my instinct was like go open Google

1150
01:12:49,995 --> 01:12:53,845
Speaker 13:  Maps and type it in and search it. And I had to backtrack. I was like,

1151
01:12:53,845 --> 01:12:57,485
Speaker 13:  no, no, no I can, I can just like highlight this in it.

1152
01:12:57,745 --> 01:13:01,605
Speaker 13:  you know you don't have to leave the app you're in just pops up with your

1153
01:13:01,605 --> 01:13:05,565
Speaker 13:  everything you were gonna look for in Google Maps. Yeah. I'm like oh this

1154
01:13:05,565 --> 01:13:09,085
Speaker 13:  is how we should have been using our phones. Like this feels so much

1155
01:13:09,475 --> 01:13:13,405
Speaker 13:  more intuitive and I think I'm gonna miss it when it's not an option.

1156
01:13:13,675 --> 01:13:17,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah it's, it's the kind of thing that seems weird

1157
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:20,005
Speaker 2:  until you do it about four times and then it's like oh this makes sense.

1158
01:13:20,315 --> 01:13:24,245
Speaker 2:  Yeah it is insane that I have to copy text in a

1159
01:13:24,245 --> 01:13:27,845
Speaker 2:  text message, close this app, open another app, go to the search bar, type

1160
01:13:27,845 --> 01:13:31,085
Speaker 2:  on that and hit search just to get the map for the direction that this person

1161
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:34,685
Speaker 2:  sent me. Like that's a bad user experience that we're just all used to like

1162
01:13:34,685 --> 01:13:37,125
Speaker 2:  this is the thing about AI in general that I think is kind of exciting. It's

1163
01:13:37,125 --> 01:13:40,965
Speaker 2:  just finding ways to shortcut all of that stuff because it can start to figure

1164
01:13:41,145 --> 01:13:45,005
Speaker 2:  out, oh this is an address, there's really only one thing you wanna do with

1165
01:13:45,005 --> 01:13:48,565
Speaker 2:  an address. Let's just do that for you. I think that's very cool.

1166
01:13:48,835 --> 01:13:52,765
Speaker 13:  Yeah, like don't write me an email like Shakespeare wrote it. Just

1167
01:13:52,765 --> 01:13:56,685
Speaker 13:  like give those shortcuts like totally do the grant work

1168
01:13:56,705 --> 01:13:58,085
Speaker 13:  for me please. Exactly.

1169
01:13:58,675 --> 01:14:01,525
Speaker 2:  Okay, last thing and then I'm gonna let you go. one of the big promises Samsung

1170
01:14:01,595 --> 01:14:05,445
Speaker 2:  made here is seven years of software support, which I think in the abstract

1171
01:14:05,445 --> 01:14:09,045
Speaker 2:  is very cool. Google also said seven years, right? So that's we, this is

1172
01:14:09,045 --> 01:14:12,605
Speaker 2:  now like the gold standard. I think that's very cool. Is it realistic if

1173
01:14:12,605 --> 01:14:16,285
Speaker 2:  I'm buying an S 24 to assume that I'm still going to want this phone in seven

1174
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:20,245
Speaker 2:  years. Like the big spec missing for me is the Q2 charging, which I think

1175
01:14:20,245 --> 01:14:23,925
Speaker 2:  is whatever seven years from now you'll probably want better wireless charging

1176
01:14:23,925 --> 01:14:27,245
Speaker 2:  than this phone gives you. But even looking past that, like is it realistic

1177
01:14:27,245 --> 01:14:31,085
Speaker 2:  for this phone or really any phone to say I am feasibly going

1178
01:14:31,085 --> 01:14:33,565
Speaker 2:  to keep this thing and it's gonna be useful to me for seven years.

1179
01:14:33,945 --> 01:14:36,925
Speaker 13:  For the vast majority of people they're gonna be trading in their phone

1180
01:14:36,925 --> 01:14:40,645
Speaker 13:  before that. Especially with the Ultra sort of feels like people who

1181
01:14:40,825 --> 01:14:44,685
Speaker 13:  buy that phone are on a quicker upgrade cycle 'cause they want the

1182
01:14:44,685 --> 01:14:47,685
Speaker 13:  next big thing with all the Yeah, with all this stuff.

1183
01:14:47,685 --> 01:14:51,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah. The Venn diagram of Spen users and people who only upgrade every seven

1184
01:14:51,205 --> 01:14:52,645
Speaker 2:  years I don't think is huge.

1185
01:14:53,145 --> 01:14:57,085
Speaker 13:  Not a big one there. But you know, I look at like my parents

1186
01:14:57,425 --> 01:15:01,125
Speaker 13:  or like bless his heart, my husband with his iPhone 10 R.

1187
01:15:01,875 --> 01:15:05,205
Speaker 13:  Yeah. They just want to not shop for a phone. They're like, I hate that.

1188
01:15:05,525 --> 01:15:08,845
Speaker 13:  I don't wanna deal with Verizon doing a whole bunch of

1189
01:15:09,145 --> 01:15:13,045
Speaker 13:  things. Jedi mind tricks, like I just want my phone and I

1190
01:15:13,045 --> 01:15:16,605
Speaker 13:  want it to work for a long time. And I think that's fair. I think Samsung

1191
01:15:17,105 --> 01:15:21,085
Speaker 13:  has a good track record in that respect. They've sort of been pushing

1192
01:15:21,085 --> 01:15:24,885
Speaker 13:  forward with more years of support and they were doing

1193
01:15:24,885 --> 01:15:28,485
Speaker 13:  better than Google for a hot second. But Google caught wise,

1194
01:15:29,105 --> 01:15:32,845
Speaker 13:  so I'm glad to see it. I think it's, it's probably gonna make a difference

1195
01:15:32,865 --> 01:15:35,405
Speaker 13:  for a minority, but I think it's important.

1196
01:15:35,715 --> 01:15:39,565
Speaker 2:  Yeah and I guess I, I do like the idea that you should be able to decide

1197
01:15:39,565 --> 01:15:42,925
Speaker 2:  to upgrade your phone before your phone forces you to upgrade it. Right?

1198
01:15:42,925 --> 01:15:46,645
Speaker 2:  Right. Like I, I think that's a good thing and I think seven years

1199
01:15:46,705 --> 01:15:49,885
Speaker 2:  is probably two years longer than even

1200
01:15:50,475 --> 01:15:53,285
Speaker 2:  most sort of normal people will keep their phones partly just because of

1201
01:15:53,285 --> 01:15:56,405
Speaker 2:  like battery health, right? Like it's, yeah, it's just gonna get to the point

1202
01:15:56,405 --> 01:15:59,205
Speaker 2:  where your phone doesn't charge for very long. Right. Anymore. But yeah,

1203
01:15:59,205 --> 01:16:02,885
Speaker 2:  then at least I'm in a position where I get to say I want a new phone rather

1204
01:16:02,885 --> 01:16:04,405
Speaker 2:  than my phone being like I'm dead.

1205
01:16:04,885 --> 01:16:05,285
Speaker 13:  Exactly.

1206
01:16:05,545 --> 01:16:09,405
Speaker 2:  Get a new phone. Yeah. So S 24 Samsung

1207
01:16:09,475 --> 01:16:13,245
Speaker 2:  usually is like the default Android phone. Does it stay

1208
01:16:13,245 --> 01:16:16,485
Speaker 2:  there this year do you think? Like is this the phone of 2024 in the Android

1209
01:16:16,485 --> 01:16:17,245
Speaker 2:  world? I

1210
01:16:17,245 --> 01:16:21,205
Speaker 13:  Think so. And I, when I reviewed the Pixel eight in the eight Pro,

1211
01:16:21,645 --> 01:16:25,045
Speaker 13:  I was really impressed and I was kind of like, Samsung's gonna have to really

1212
01:16:25,045 --> 01:16:28,885
Speaker 13:  come up with something. And I think they did. There's an asterisk,

1213
01:16:29,035 --> 01:16:32,525
Speaker 13:  there's, you know, if Samsung software is very

1214
01:16:32,525 --> 01:16:36,445
Speaker 13:  unappealing to you, you just want something a little more turnkey.

1215
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:41,125
Speaker 13:  You don't ever want to think about whether Bixby exists

1216
01:16:41,185 --> 01:16:45,165
Speaker 13:  or not. The Pixel is a great option and, and there

1217
01:16:45,165 --> 01:16:49,085
Speaker 13:  are things I think that are compelling about it. you know, If, you

1218
01:16:49,085 --> 01:16:53,005
Speaker 13:  do like the face swap that's there for

1219
01:16:53,005 --> 01:16:56,725
Speaker 13:  you. The way the assistant like processes natural

1220
01:16:57,325 --> 01:17:01,285
Speaker 13:  language is a little better than on the assistant

1221
01:17:01,305 --> 01:17:05,005
Speaker 13:  on the Samsung Galaxy phones. So there are still reasons to look at the

1222
01:17:05,005 --> 01:17:08,645
Speaker 13:  Pixel, but I think, yeah, I think Samsung keeps, keeps the Crown

1223
01:17:09,275 --> 01:17:12,845
Speaker 2:  Fair enough. All right, we're gonna do this many more times but I'm

1224
01:17:12,845 --> 01:17:15,885
Speaker 2:  especially, I'm gonna play you that clip when we do the pixel nine, whenever

1225
01:17:15,885 --> 01:17:18,765
Speaker 2:  that comes out this year. Okay. And we're gonna see how it holds up, but

1226
01:17:18,765 --> 01:17:19,765
Speaker 2:  I appreciate it. Thanks Allison.

1227
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:20,605
Speaker 14:  Thank you.

1228
01:17:22,115 --> 01:17:22,605
Speaker 15:  Alright,

1229
01:17:22,605 --> 01:17:25,005
Speaker 2:  We gotta take one more break and then we'll be back to answer a question

1230
01:17:25,025 --> 01:17:27,125
Speaker 2:  for To Vergecast Hotline. We'll be right back.

1231
01:19:24,785 --> 01:19:28,315
Speaker 2:  Welcome back, let's get to the Hotline as always. The number is

1232
01:19:28,315 --> 01:19:32,155
Speaker 2:  8 6 6 Verge one one and the email is Vergecast at The

1233
01:19:32,155 --> 01:19:35,875
Speaker 2:  Verge dot com. We love all of your questions. It's been so fun hearing about

1234
01:19:35,975 --> 01:19:39,835
Speaker 2:  everybody's Vision Pro experiences and we're gonna try to keep putting

1235
01:19:39,835 --> 01:19:43,155
Speaker 2:  that stuff on the show as much as we can. We don't wanna overload you with

1236
01:19:43,155 --> 01:19:46,875
Speaker 2:  Vision Pro stuff, but we think this thing is fascinating this week. Surprise.

1237
01:19:46,875 --> 01:19:49,715
Speaker 2:  We have a Vision Pro question. We're gonna get to a bunch more of these,

1238
01:19:49,715 --> 01:19:53,355
Speaker 2:  like I said, including your experiences, which I loved hearing about

1239
01:19:53,735 --> 01:19:56,115
Speaker 2:  on Friday, but I thought this one was interesting and actually made me think

1240
01:19:56,455 --> 01:20:00,035
Speaker 2:  a lot. It comes from Dan, I think maybe Stan. I think

1241
01:20:00,055 --> 01:20:02,635
Speaker 2:  it's Dan either way. If I got your name wrong, I'm sorry. Here it's,

1242
01:20:03,695 --> 01:20:07,585
Speaker 17:  Hey there. This is Dan from San Francisco. I got a Vision Pro

1243
01:20:07,775 --> 01:20:11,585
Speaker 17:  icon in my iPhone camera app today and I think

1244
01:20:11,975 --> 01:20:15,865
Speaker 17:  that it wants me to start shooting in spatial video. Should I do

1245
01:20:15,865 --> 01:20:19,825
Speaker 17:  that? even that I might not buy a Vision Pro ever. Can I

1246
01:20:19,825 --> 01:20:23,545
Speaker 17:  shoot everything in Spatial Pro already or should I wait and shoot

1247
01:20:23,645 --> 01:20:26,625
Speaker 17:  normal video now? Only help me out. Thank you.

1248
01:20:27,215 --> 01:20:30,665
Speaker 2:  Okay, so I've gone back and forth on this question a bunch since I first

1249
01:20:30,665 --> 01:20:34,425
Speaker 2:  heard it and I think the answer is no. I think at this

1250
01:20:34,425 --> 01:20:38,105
Speaker 2:  point, If, you have no particular intention of getting a headset.

1251
01:20:38,685 --> 01:20:42,505
Speaker 2:  The answer's kind of no spatial video has some really neat stuff going on,

1252
01:20:42,555 --> 01:20:46,065
Speaker 2:  especially the way it's integrated with the headset If. you just shoot it

1253
01:20:46,065 --> 01:20:49,705
Speaker 2:  on your iPhone. You're kind of just capturing 3D video and that's all well

1254
01:20:49,705 --> 01:20:53,185
Speaker 2:  and good. The Vision Pro has that neat way of presenting it where it has

1255
01:20:53,185 --> 01:20:56,585
Speaker 2:  those kind of misty borders around it. So it looks a little like you're looking

1256
01:20:56,585 --> 01:21:00,265
Speaker 2:  through a portal rather than just looking at a video. But the other thing

1257
01:21:00,265 --> 01:21:03,905
Speaker 2:  about the Vision Pro is that actually it's a great way to just watch regular

1258
01:21:04,195 --> 01:21:07,985
Speaker 2:  video and you can get 4K video off of the iPhone. You

1259
01:21:07,985 --> 01:21:11,905
Speaker 2:  can't get 4K spatial video. Spatial video is huge. It's

1260
01:21:11,905 --> 01:21:15,825
Speaker 2:  about twice the size of a normal 10 80 p video So I think at this

1261
01:21:15,825 --> 01:21:19,505
Speaker 2:  point, if you're not anticipating getting this soon If, you wanna use spatial

1262
01:21:19,505 --> 01:21:23,465
Speaker 2:  video as like the second thing you shoot, right? You're like, I'm gonna take

1263
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:26,945
Speaker 2:  a video of my kid's baseball game. Take the regular video first and take

1264
01:21:26,945 --> 01:21:30,025
Speaker 2:  it in the highest quality you can and then go back and get the spatial video.

1265
01:21:30,095 --> 01:21:33,745
Speaker 2:  It's a fun sort of neat thing, but I wouldn't treat that as your

1266
01:21:33,935 --> 01:21:37,625
Speaker 2:  main media capture situation. That said,

1267
01:21:37,865 --> 01:21:41,825
Speaker 2:  I do think spatial video is coming in the sense that

1268
01:21:41,905 --> 01:21:44,985
Speaker 2:  I think everyone agrees that this is a format that is going to be around

1269
01:21:45,005 --> 01:21:48,905
Speaker 2:  for a long time. Meta is now supporting spatial video on the Quest headsets.

1270
01:21:49,115 --> 01:21:52,945
Speaker 2:  Apple is obviously all in on the Vision Pro, both as a capture

1271
01:21:53,115 --> 01:21:56,825
Speaker 2:  thing for spatial video and as a way to watch it back. I think this format

1272
01:21:56,925 --> 01:21:59,865
Speaker 2:  is real, so it's a fun thing to start playing around with. I don't think

1273
01:21:59,865 --> 01:22:03,625
Speaker 2:  it's like the 3D video of eight years ago that

1274
01:22:03,625 --> 01:22:06,425
Speaker 2:  kind of went nowhere and now You don't really even have a way to play it.

1275
01:22:06,825 --> 01:22:10,545
Speaker 2:  I don't think spatial video is going to die, but I also don't think it's

1276
