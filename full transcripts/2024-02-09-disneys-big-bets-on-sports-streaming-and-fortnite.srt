Description: The Verge's David Pierce, Alex Cranz, and Adi Robertson discuss sports streaming, Apple Vision Pro updates, Bluesky removing its invite system, and more.

2
00:01:02,035 --> 00:01:05,845
Speaker 5:  Welcome To. The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of multi-stakeholder

3
00:01:05,845 --> 00:01:09,605
Speaker 5:  media companies. I'm your friend David Pierce. NELI Patel is

4
00:01:09,665 --> 00:01:13,325
Speaker 5:  not here, but we all are, which is very exciting. Alex Cranz is here. Hi

5
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:13,525
Speaker 5:  Alex.

6
00:01:13,585 --> 00:01:16,565
Speaker 3:  Hey, I'm your friend who's ready to do a victory lap. Let's go in second.

7
00:01:16,565 --> 00:01:20,245
Speaker 5:  Let's, it's coming. It's coming. Addie Robertson's here. Hi Addie. We have

8
00:01:20,245 --> 00:01:23,485
Speaker 5:  a lot to talk about this week. There's a bunch of streaming news. Disney

9
00:01:23,945 --> 00:01:26,845
Speaker 5:  did a just all the things we're gonna talk about that, A bunch of Vision

10
00:01:26,905 --> 00:01:30,325
Speaker 5:  Pro stuff. This is like the first week that regular humans got vision pros

11
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:34,125
Speaker 5:  and it got real weird. So we're gonna talk about that Bluesky stuff, bunch

12
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:37,845
Speaker 5:  of other stuff. We'll do a big lightning round. But let's start with Disney,

13
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,925
Speaker 5:  right? I feel like we have to start with Disney. I hate, hate, hate talking

14
00:01:40,925 --> 00:01:43,365
Speaker 5:  about earnings on the podcast. Technically it is my least favorite thing,

15
00:01:43,665 --> 00:01:46,365
Speaker 5:  but every once in a while Bob Iger shows up and is like, what's up losers?

16
00:01:46,765 --> 00:01:47,445
Speaker 5:  It's earnings time.

17
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:50,845
Speaker 3:  Well, I think technically it's not just Disney, right? Like it's Disney and

18
00:01:50,865 --> 00:01:53,885
Speaker 3:  and Warner Brothers discovery. True.

19
00:01:53,885 --> 00:01:57,405
Speaker 5:  Okay. You're right. Fox. So within the Disney story there are like somewhere

20
00:01:57,405 --> 00:02:01,285
Speaker 5:  between two and three individual stories.

21
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,765
Speaker 5:  Yes. We should probably start with the sports thing, right? That was kind

22
00:02:04,765 --> 00:02:08,685
Speaker 5:  of the big streaming wars news of the week and Alex, this is where your victory

23
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:10,325
Speaker 5:  lap begins. This, this tell us what's going

24
00:02:10,325 --> 00:02:14,005
Speaker 3:  On. Yeah. So what's happening is, is ESPN and Fox, which are both

25
00:02:14,005 --> 00:02:17,925
Speaker 3:  currently owned by Disney, are Oh yeah. Are teaming

26
00:02:17,925 --> 00:02:21,285
Speaker 3:  up with Warner Brothers, which is not owned by Disney currently.

27
00:02:21,285 --> 00:02:22,205
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Give it time.

28
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:26,045
Speaker 3:  Give it time are all coming together to make a giant streaming app,

29
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:29,845
Speaker 3:  which is effectively what Hulu was back in like 2009, which is

30
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:33,765
Speaker 3:  when A, B, C and Fox and NBC

31
00:02:34,585 --> 00:02:38,485
Speaker 3:  all eventually came together to make Hulu and like fund Hulu

32
00:02:38,485 --> 00:02:40,925
Speaker 3:  and put all their content on it. It didn't start that way, but that's, that's

33
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:43,765
Speaker 3:  where it went after like a year or two and that's what's happening now. It's

34
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:47,645
Speaker 3:  like Hulu for sports. And I said that right as the news broke

35
00:02:48,065 --> 00:02:51,525
Speaker 3:  and then as more came out it was like, yes, I'm right. It is Hulu for sports.

36
00:02:51,555 --> 00:02:54,485
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You were increasingly vindicated. Yeah, just bit. So, okay, lemme lemme

37
00:02:54,485 --> 00:02:58,045
Speaker 5:  see if I understand this 'cause we've gotten sort of bits and pieces of information

38
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:01,645
Speaker 5:  about what this thing is, but it's, it's a streaming service that is launching

39
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:05,725
Speaker 5:  later this year sometime. Yep. It will have a name. Yep. We don't know

40
00:03:05,725 --> 00:03:09,445
Speaker 5:  what the name is. Warner Brothers is involved. So it will probably be

41
00:03:09,445 --> 00:03:13,205
Speaker 5:  stupid but it will have a name, it's gonna be a

42
00:03:13,225 --> 00:03:16,765
Speaker 5:  mix of all of the linear networks

43
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:20,845
Speaker 5:  owned by those companies. Right. So like all the ESPNs,

44
00:03:21,185 --> 00:03:25,165
Speaker 5:  all the Fox sports', A, B, C, all the TT of

45
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:25,365
Speaker 5:  the world,

46
00:03:25,845 --> 00:03:26,245
Speaker 3:  TBS

47
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:29,325
Speaker 5:  And just like those full channels. Yes. Right. It's just like it is, it is

48
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:32,645
Speaker 5:  live television of those channels. Sports are not sports. Right, right. Okay.

49
00:03:32,685 --> 00:03:35,045
Speaker 5:  'cause that was one of the big questions is like is this just sports? Is

50
00:03:35,045 --> 00:03:37,445
Speaker 5:  this not it's just, it's just channels. Yeah.

51
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:41,445
Speaker 3:  It'ss just channels, but it basically is sports. Okay. Right. And

52
00:03:41,585 --> 00:03:45,365
Speaker 3:  and and so it's gonna be like, it's gonna be all of these different sports

53
00:03:45,365 --> 00:03:48,805
Speaker 3:  things and then Disney is still saying they're gonna do something with ESPN

54
00:03:49,385 --> 00:03:53,005
Speaker 3:  as its own standalone, which has me wondering what the hell's going on with

55
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:56,725
Speaker 3:  the ESPN Plus, which I think you are one of the few people

56
00:03:56,725 --> 00:03:58,685
Speaker 3:  I've ever met that was like, yes, this is a rad service.

57
00:03:59,225 --> 00:04:02,485
Speaker 5:  No this is good. Okay. You're explaining that this makes no sense. Yeah.

58
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:06,285
Speaker 5:  Which is the thing that I have been trying to figure out is does this actually

59
00:04:06,285 --> 00:04:08,645
Speaker 5:  make any sense? Because all of that is there right. And then there's going

60
00:04:08,645 --> 00:04:11,565
Speaker 5:  to be what I think amounts to like

61
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:15,965
Speaker 5:  individual sports, right? Yeah. So the stuff on ESPN plus the stuff that

62
00:04:16,585 --> 00:04:20,205
Speaker 5:  Warner Brothers gets through the Bleacher report,

63
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:23,725
Speaker 5:  the stuff that Fox has streaming, like all that will also exist

64
00:04:24,145 --> 00:04:26,285
Speaker 5:  inside of this Hulu for sports

65
00:04:26,515 --> 00:04:27,565
Speaker 3:  Theoretically. Yeah.

66
00:04:27,855 --> 00:04:28,205
Speaker 5:  Thing.

67
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:33,165
Speaker 5:  And that's, that's it, right? It will have its own price, you can pay for

68
00:04:33,165 --> 00:04:36,445
Speaker 5:  it, but also If, you wanna watch all of that stuff on the other services

69
00:04:36,445 --> 00:04:40,205
Speaker 5:  that are also part of this. You can, and a lot of that stuff will

70
00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:42,805
Speaker 5:  also be on cable because it's just the cable channels that you're getting

71
00:04:42,805 --> 00:04:44,845
Speaker 5:  in the streaming bundle. So what is this thing?

72
00:04:45,445 --> 00:04:49,245
Speaker 3:  I think, I think it's like a question I think I hear a lot from my brother

73
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:52,605
Speaker 3:  and sometimes from you and Eli, but you guys are much more technically savvy

74
00:04:53,385 --> 00:04:56,725
Speaker 3:  is streaming is really hard. If, you wanna watch sports? Yes. Like my brother

75
00:04:56,865 --> 00:05:00,285
Speaker 3:  is constantly complaining because he, he thinks okay, I have this sports

76
00:05:00,315 --> 00:05:03,925
Speaker 3:  service that means I can watch the Cowboys anytime I want. Well

77
00:05:04,185 --> 00:05:08,125
Speaker 3:  the Mavericks now, now I can watch the Mavericks anytime I want and and then

78
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:11,725
Speaker 3:  he'll be like, no, it's a blackout and and it's really annoying

79
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:15,805
Speaker 3:  and he has to then go buy another streaming service or he has to find someone

80
00:05:15,905 --> 00:05:19,805
Speaker 3:  who like can like stream just that one channel to him and

81
00:05:19,805 --> 00:05:23,645
Speaker 3:  it's all stupid and confusing and this I think is going to potentially reduce

82
00:05:23,645 --> 00:05:27,285
Speaker 3:  that confusion but not a lot because sports streaming is still

83
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:31,565
Speaker 3:  a huge mess because every single sports like owner

84
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:35,485
Speaker 3:  like NFL and everybody is selling their rights all over the place in

85
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:39,285
Speaker 3:  all these different ways and like trying to put all of their eggs

86
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:43,045
Speaker 3:  in every single basket. And it feels like this is kind of

87
00:05:43,045 --> 00:05:43,845
Speaker 3:  solving for that

88
00:05:45,485 --> 00:05:46,545
Speaker 3:  but kind of not.

89
00:05:48,005 --> 00:05:51,815
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It feels like don don't know. Addie, does any of this make any sense

90
00:05:51,815 --> 00:05:54,535
Speaker 5:  to you? Can you explain this to us? Sports as the resident sports lover,

91
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:55,175
Speaker 5:  the

92
00:05:55,175 --> 00:05:56,695
Speaker 3:  Person, the person who clearly knows

93
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,605
Speaker 6:  Anything about sports. I mean this seems mostly it.

94
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:04,325
Speaker 6:  That is absolutely the impression I get is that sports is the great thing

95
00:06:04,325 --> 00:06:07,845
Speaker 6:  that streaming hasn't managed to do anything with yet, right? Yes. Which

96
00:06:07,845 --> 00:06:11,245
Speaker 6:  also I think means that there's more of a piracy ecosystem around it in a

97
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:14,725
Speaker 6:  lot of ways. And I do wonder what impact that's going to have on this

98
00:06:15,065 --> 00:06:19,045
Speaker 6:  at a time when my sense is piracy and all the other areas that streaming

99
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,165
Speaker 6:  once decimated has grown a lot. Yes.

100
00:06:21,745 --> 00:06:25,285
Speaker 5:  That's interesting. Yeah. Yeah. I don't really pirate anything except off

101
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:29,165
Speaker 5:  of Alex's plex server. Totally legal. But I have

102
00:06:29,195 --> 00:06:32,925
Speaker 5:  watched more sports than I'm proud of on like a TikTok

103
00:06:32,995 --> 00:06:36,125
Speaker 5:  live stream because I literally couldn't find anywhere else to watch it.

104
00:06:36,485 --> 00:06:40,205
Speaker 5:  I generally feel like if I try my hardest to find a legal way to watch something

105
00:06:40,205 --> 00:06:44,005
Speaker 5:  and there isn't one, it's no longer my fault. Which is not a good legal argument,

106
00:06:44,145 --> 00:06:47,525
Speaker 5:  but it's how I feel about streaming. And often with sports I'm like okay,

107
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:51,325
Speaker 5:  I pay for every single streaming service I can find that will

108
00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:54,965
Speaker 5:  show me sports and still there's like a one in three chance I just can't

109
00:06:54,965 --> 00:06:56,645
Speaker 5:  watch whatever is on. And

110
00:06:56,665 --> 00:06:58,205
Speaker 3:  You pay for Life TV too, right?

111
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,645
Speaker 5:  Not anymore So. I got rid of cable. But the, this is part of the whole thing

112
00:07:01,645 --> 00:07:04,685
Speaker 5:  is like the only reason now to have cable

113
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:08,885
Speaker 5:  is If you like sports because it is the one place that generally has all

114
00:07:08,885 --> 00:07:12,805
Speaker 5:  the sports. Unless you want, like if you're big into like college volleyball,

115
00:07:13,505 --> 00:07:17,445
Speaker 5:  you're on ESPN Plus, right? But for the most part, live

116
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:21,525
Speaker 5:  TV is like the last bastion of, it's just where all the things

117
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,245
Speaker 5:  are. Which is very funny because now that's the biggest problem in streaming

118
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:27,245
Speaker 5:  is there is no place where all the things are. So we all just want cable

119
00:07:27,245 --> 00:07:27,965
Speaker 5:  again. Well

120
00:07:27,965 --> 00:07:31,325
Speaker 3:  And there are also these, these smaller services that do live streaming

121
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:35,365
Speaker 3:  that sports is kind of what they do. Like I think FUBU is one

122
00:07:35,805 --> 00:07:39,725
Speaker 3:  and Sling TV is another one where like they still have

123
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:43,325
Speaker 3:  all of these channels and so they've been making 40, $50 a month on people

124
00:07:43,585 --> 00:07:46,725
Speaker 3:  for just this. Right. And they're about to get bodied.

125
00:07:46,985 --> 00:07:50,205
Speaker 5:  Do you think so like is this the end of online tv

126
00:07:50,205 --> 00:07:52,845
Speaker 3:  I, don Dunno, a lot of live tv? No, I don't think it's the end of online,

127
00:07:53,595 --> 00:07:56,645
Speaker 3:  live online tv. I think it's probably going to be

128
00:07:57,325 --> 00:08:01,205
Speaker 3:  devastating for a few specific companies like

129
00:08:01,405 --> 00:08:03,565
Speaker 3:  Sling and fubu. Yeah, right.

130
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:07,165
Speaker 5:  Who I pay for Sling exclusively to watch sports. Yeah. And I will stop now.

131
00:08:07,745 --> 00:08:09,085
Speaker 3:  Hulu's gonna be fine. Right.

132
00:08:10,665 --> 00:08:12,365
Speaker 3:  Who else does live streaming at this point?

133
00:08:12,365 --> 00:08:15,365
Speaker 5:  YouTube TV is the big one now. YouTube. Yeah. And YouTube TV has even made

134
00:08:15,445 --> 00:08:18,645
Speaker 5:  a big deal out of sports as the reason to have YouTube tv.

135
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:21,685
Speaker 5:  Like they got the NFL Sunday ticket deal. They paid a whole bunch of money

136
00:08:21,685 --> 00:08:25,645
Speaker 5:  for it's, it's the core thing that YouTube TV is,

137
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:28,845
Speaker 5:  is a sports package. And increasingly

138
00:08:29,985 --> 00:08:33,725
Speaker 5:  if this thing works and there are a million reasons to think it might not,

139
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:36,885
Speaker 5:  like did you see guys see the news today that the leagues were blindsided

140
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:40,205
Speaker 5:  by this and had no idea this was coming, which is bananas. And

141
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:41,085
Speaker 5:  I feel

142
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:44,445
Speaker 3:  Like the FTC is gonna be very busy with this soon. I'm

143
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,085
Speaker 6:  Actually curious why this hasn't happened earlier

144
00:08:46,555 --> 00:08:48,285
Speaker 3:  With the, everybody bundling together

145
00:08:48,755 --> 00:08:52,565
Speaker 6:  Just the sports sport. Like a, someone making a really big play for

146
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,245
Speaker 6:  live a large live sports.

147
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:58,205
Speaker 3:  It's because partially the leagues, the leagues don't, like the leagues wanna

148
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:01,405
Speaker 3:  control their rights. Their rights are super, super lucrative. Which is why

149
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:05,565
Speaker 3:  Google spent a ton of money to get YouTube TV and and the

150
00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:06,765
Speaker 3:  NFL Sports

151
00:09:06,765 --> 00:09:07,805
Speaker 5:  Sunday ticket Sunday

152
00:09:07,805 --> 00:09:09,925
Speaker 3:  Ticket. Yeah. There we go. Sports ticket. Sports ticket.

153
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:13,685
Speaker 5:  It's the same thing. It's, no, I it's, it's, I think it honestly begins and

154
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:17,485
Speaker 5:  ends there. It is so expensive to have sports and it is like

155
00:09:17,585 --> 00:09:21,485
Speaker 5:  the last thing that is that expensive. And I think it,

156
00:09:21,485 --> 00:09:24,605
Speaker 5:  but I think it spins both ways, right? I think for a while it was like, oh

157
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,445
Speaker 5:  okay, we can use sports to grow our own thing. And

158
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:32,245
Speaker 5:  I think it was when Max launched that they made a big deal outta

159
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:34,765
Speaker 5:  Bleacher Report being part of it, right? Right. They were like, we have HBO

160
00:09:34,945 --> 00:09:38,525
Speaker 5:  and we have Bleacher Report as if those things were like equals. And that

161
00:09:38,705 --> 00:09:42,565
Speaker 5:  didn't really work. And now I think all these companies

162
00:09:42,565 --> 00:09:45,765
Speaker 5:  are at a point where it's like, okay, if you're trying to buy sports rights,

163
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:49,645
Speaker 5:  which again are the best way to win in tv,

164
00:09:49,815 --> 00:09:53,245
Speaker 5:  right? Is to like If, you have the NFL, you're going to have a successful

165
00:09:53,245 --> 00:09:57,165
Speaker 5:  television business. It's just how it works. If, you want to do that?

166
00:09:57,585 --> 00:10:01,205
Speaker 5:  You either have to have tech company money because now

167
00:10:01,545 --> 00:10:04,845
Speaker 5:  Amazon and Apple and Google are all in this fight and they just have infinity

168
00:10:04,845 --> 00:10:08,765
Speaker 5:  money to throw at this or they have to band

169
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:12,885
Speaker 5:  together and find a way to fight this. Because what the leagues want is

170
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,845
Speaker 5:  they want their stuff to be everywhere, which is why they're also on broadcast

171
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:19,405
Speaker 5:  tv. Roger Goodell, the NFL commissioner, just gave a long

172
00:10:19,465 --> 00:10:23,325
Speaker 5:  speech basically about how they're not gonna ditch broadcast TV because that's

173
00:10:23,325 --> 00:10:25,885
Speaker 5:  how most people experience the games. It's like that's true and it's gonna

174
00:10:25,885 --> 00:10:29,525
Speaker 5:  be true for a while. So you either have to replace that

175
00:10:29,965 --> 00:10:33,685
Speaker 5:  unbelievable scale with some other kind of unbelievable scale, which I think

176
00:10:33,685 --> 00:10:36,485
Speaker 5:  each of these companies wanted to do. I know for sure Disney has been trying

177
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:39,685
Speaker 5:  to do this, right? They're like, oh, ESPN is going to be the thing. And they're

178
00:10:39,685 --> 00:10:42,485
Speaker 5:  like, well it's gonna cost you like a hundred billion dollars. And they're

179
00:10:42,485 --> 00:10:46,365
Speaker 5:  like, well nevermind. And so it, it does seem

180
00:10:46,525 --> 00:10:49,285
Speaker 5:  like kind of a sign of desperation out of these companies that they're like,

181
00:10:49,285 --> 00:10:53,245
Speaker 5:  our only chance is to all do this together or else we're host.

182
00:10:53,245 --> 00:10:56,885
Speaker 3:  Well we, we saw that last year because ESPN has been book looking for a partner

183
00:10:56,945 --> 00:11:00,445
Speaker 3:  for a while now and yeah. And apparently it had one over at Fox, which is

184
00:11:00,445 --> 00:11:03,725
Speaker 3:  part of Disney. They could've just like walked down the street and knocked

185
00:11:03,725 --> 00:11:07,685
Speaker 3:  on the door, but like, let's work together, come on. And I,

186
00:11:07,685 --> 00:11:11,445
Speaker 3:  I guess they finally did. And then Warner Brothers who has very, very vocally,

187
00:11:11,445 --> 00:11:14,805
Speaker 3:  like David Zoff has been like, anybody wanna do business with me? I'm ready

188
00:11:14,805 --> 00:11:15,365
Speaker 3:  to do business.

189
00:11:15,365 --> 00:11:17,885
Speaker 5:  Yeah. He's like, I'll buy you, you buy me. I don't care. Let's just whatever

190
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,165
Speaker 5:  you want, let's just, let's sign some checks. And

191
00:11:19,165 --> 00:11:22,365
Speaker 3:  And this like is a great deal for them because most of these,

192
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:26,205
Speaker 3:  most of these big channels are owned by Disney. Only a few of these channels

193
00:11:26,205 --> 00:11:29,885
Speaker 3:  are owned by Warner Brothers and now they've got like an

194
00:11:29,985 --> 00:11:33,565
Speaker 3:  actual leg into sports, no disrespect to Bleacher Report. They've got an

195
00:11:33,565 --> 00:11:37,405
Speaker 3:  actual leg into like live broadcast sports. Yeah. And that's huge

196
00:11:37,545 --> 00:11:41,045
Speaker 3:  for them. And then these other two have some money bags over in the corner

197
00:11:41,425 --> 00:11:44,885
Speaker 3:  who are gonna pay them more money and hopefully fund whatever

198
00:11:45,195 --> 00:11:48,605
Speaker 3:  massive lawsuits I guess they're gonna deal with from the leagues and

199
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:52,525
Speaker 3:  probably the FTC. It does absolutely feel like the kind of

200
00:11:52,725 --> 00:11:55,085
Speaker 6:  Consolidation that the FTC right now is, is

201
00:11:55,085 --> 00:11:55,365
Speaker 3:  Gonna be

202
00:11:55,365 --> 00:11:56,085
Speaker 6:  Like. Yeah.

203
00:11:56,605 --> 00:11:56,685
Speaker 3:  Hmm.

204
00:11:57,585 --> 00:11:59,565
Speaker 5:  Do you think I've been, I've been going back and forth on this. 'cause on

205
00:11:59,565 --> 00:12:03,405
Speaker 5:  the one hand it's just a thing they're all doing together, right? And I think

206
00:12:03,545 --> 00:12:07,325
Speaker 5:  the case that they seem to be making to each other and to the sports

207
00:12:07,325 --> 00:12:11,005
Speaker 5:  leagues and to the world is like, this isn't a new product. We're just taking

208
00:12:11,405 --> 00:12:15,045
Speaker 5:  a bunch of existing things. Like one of the things I was reading made an

209
00:12:15,205 --> 00:12:19,045
Speaker 5:  interesting case that the fact that they are linear streaming

210
00:12:19,045 --> 00:12:23,005
Speaker 5:  channels and not some new way of disseminating

211
00:12:23,005 --> 00:12:26,365
Speaker 5:  the content is how they've managed to do this without signing new deals with

212
00:12:26,365 --> 00:12:29,405
Speaker 5:  the league. And don don't know if that's true or not, but I assume the case

213
00:12:29,405 --> 00:12:33,165
Speaker 5:  that they're gonna make is, this is okay because it's all, you know, stuff

214
00:12:33,165 --> 00:12:36,245
Speaker 5:  we were doing anyway, we're just packaging it differently. But I have a hard

215
00:12:36,245 --> 00:12:39,325
Speaker 5:  time imagining that's how it reads to feel like Han or anyone else.

216
00:12:39,535 --> 00:12:42,525
Speaker 6:  We've just spent a bunch of time talking about these small streaming players

217
00:12:42,555 --> 00:12:46,125
Speaker 6:  that are going to get bodied by this. Yeah. And that is just the biggest

218
00:12:46,605 --> 00:12:48,565
Speaker 6:  argument that Yeah. That people could make.

219
00:12:48,755 --> 00:12:50,365
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I think that's probably right.

220
00:12:50,555 --> 00:12:53,965
Speaker 3:  It's all down to Fuo, FUO and Sling TV are about to change

221
00:12:54,385 --> 00:12:56,365
Speaker 3:  the history of sports broadcasting in America.

222
00:12:56,825 --> 00:13:00,805
Speaker 5:  But wait, let's talk about Hulu because yeah, the, you made

223
00:13:00,805 --> 00:13:03,125
Speaker 5:  the case when this is first coming out that this is Hulu for sports, right?

224
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:06,285
Speaker 5:  Which congratulations, you were precisely correct on that. We should also

225
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:09,765
Speaker 5:  probably do a disclosure here. Let's see, NELI ISS not here so we'll, we'll

226
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:13,405
Speaker 5:  do it. Comcast is an minority investor in Vox Media

227
00:13:13,405 --> 00:13:17,125
Speaker 5:  through its subsidiary NBC Universal, which owns Peacock, notably

228
00:13:17,225 --> 00:13:20,685
Speaker 5:  not a part of this. Notably also owns lots of sports rights as does CBS and

229
00:13:20,685 --> 00:13:23,165
Speaker 5:  Paramount plus. So lots of sports still not in this.

230
00:13:24,545 --> 00:13:28,445
Speaker 5:  We made a Netflix show. It's good. I had nothing to do with it. Y'all might

231
00:13:28,445 --> 00:13:29,805
Speaker 5:  have, it's a show. Oh, you did

232
00:13:30,065 --> 00:13:30,605
Speaker 6:  An interview.

233
00:13:31,085 --> 00:13:33,725
Speaker 5:  There you go. So Addie is wildly conflicted. Oh my

234
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:34,885
Speaker 3:  God. Addie, why are you doing

235
00:13:35,985 --> 00:13:38,925
Speaker 5:  Don Don't know other things. Alex as a black server, I have a black dubious

236
00:13:38,925 --> 00:13:42,905
Speaker 5:  legality. But we should just

237
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:46,665
Speaker 5:  like, let's, let's do a little bit of a retrospective on whether

238
00:13:46,775 --> 00:13:50,545
Speaker 5:  Hulu was a good idea because If you rewind a million years ago, it was

239
00:13:50,545 --> 00:13:54,465
Speaker 5:  sort of a similar thing, right? They were like, okay, Netflix exists.

240
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:58,385
Speaker 5:  What we need is a way to take all the things that we like about broadcast

241
00:13:58,445 --> 00:14:01,235
Speaker 5:  TV on the internet. Well

242
00:14:01,235 --> 00:14:03,915
Speaker 3:  They weren't even fighting Netflix at the time. They were explicitly fighting

243
00:14:04,265 --> 00:14:07,635
Speaker 3:  pirates. Like they were they were No, that's right. It was Torrance. They,

244
00:14:07,635 --> 00:14:10,635
Speaker 3:  they were, they were fed up with Torrance. don don't know who does those.

245
00:14:11,175 --> 00:14:14,635
Speaker 3:  And and they were too super upset with it. And so they said So I think it

246
00:14:14,635 --> 00:14:18,395
Speaker 3:  was like NBC Universal was one of the first ones was like, Hey, let's, it

247
00:14:18,395 --> 00:14:21,315
Speaker 3:  got with some private equity companies and, and made this deal. And then

248
00:14:21,635 --> 00:14:25,595
Speaker 3:  A, B, C and Fox, who at that point, only one of them was owned

249
00:14:25,595 --> 00:14:29,355
Speaker 3:  by Disney all said, oh, we, we wanna be in on this too. We want like a

250
00:14:29,355 --> 00:14:33,275
Speaker 3:  nice controlled way to get our stuff out there without having to manage

251
00:14:33,275 --> 00:14:36,755
Speaker 3:  like abc.go.com. Remember that website? Oh yeah.

252
00:14:37,095 --> 00:14:40,115
Speaker 3:  And, and so they said, okay, let's all bundle together. Let's, let's do it

253
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:44,315
Speaker 3:  this way. And then CBS was like, F you guys we're gonna go do

254
00:14:44,315 --> 00:14:47,675
Speaker 3:  our own thing. And eventually that became Paramount Plus, which

255
00:14:47,675 --> 00:14:50,315
Speaker 5:  Is weird. We we choose not to reference CBS all Access.

256
00:14:50,705 --> 00:14:54,005
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It was like, it, it just went off and did its own thing. But everybody

257
00:14:54,005 --> 00:14:57,965
Speaker 3:  else came together to fight piracy and at the time Hulu was

258
00:14:57,995 --> 00:15:01,005
Speaker 3:  huge. Like it was like the second most followed website after like YouTube

259
00:15:01,065 --> 00:15:03,485
Speaker 3:  or something at the time because people were really into it. 'cause they

260
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,005
Speaker 3:  got all the stuff and then everybody immediately started to like

261
00:15:07,145 --> 00:15:10,525
Speaker 3:  bicker and, and fight. Because apparently when you have all of these huge

262
00:15:10,755 --> 00:15:13,605
Speaker 3:  egos and, and big companies in the room all trying to work together,

263
00:15:14,555 --> 00:15:17,045
Speaker 3:  they don't. So Right.

264
00:15:17,155 --> 00:15:21,005
Speaker 5:  Well, and and I feel like that the other reason this is

265
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:24,805
Speaker 5:  just Hulu again is it's that dynamic. Exactly. Yeah. Right. It's, I don't

266
00:15:24,805 --> 00:15:27,965
Speaker 5:  think pirates are so much the fight here. Like I, I really

267
00:15:28,565 --> 00:15:32,525
Speaker 5:  increasingly believe this is about like rights consolidation and making sure

268
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:36,085
Speaker 5:  a hundred they can, they can like continue to stay in the game together and

269
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:39,485
Speaker 5:  build a sports thing. Both because it's what people want and because it's

270
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:42,605
Speaker 5:  the only way any of them can afford it. But this sense of like, okay, if

271
00:15:42,605 --> 00:15:46,525
Speaker 5:  we don't give people one place to come to do it, they will find other ways

272
00:15:46,525 --> 00:15:50,205
Speaker 5:  that are worse for us. Yeah. Which is what Hulu was. And Hulu really worked

273
00:15:50,205 --> 00:15:53,405
Speaker 5:  because it was like, oh I wanna watch Parks and Rec, which was just on tv.

274
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:56,245
Speaker 5:  I can either go torrent it tomorrow or I can just go to Hulu tomorrow. And

275
00:15:56,245 --> 00:15:59,205
Speaker 5:  everybody went to Hulu 'cause it was easier. Yep. It was like it was Spotify

276
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:03,125
Speaker 5:  in the music industry, like same thing. But then it turns out that

277
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:06,205
Speaker 5:  having three large companies own a company together

278
00:16:06,955 --> 00:16:10,685
Speaker 5:  goes badly. Yeah. And like, you know, who's been through this now is Disney

279
00:16:10,945 --> 00:16:14,645
Speaker 5:  Disney knows this better than anybody and is now willingly

280
00:16:14,645 --> 00:16:17,925
Speaker 5:  signing up for this again, Disney just screwed itself into paying like

281
00:16:17,925 --> 00:16:21,845
Speaker 5:  20 billion more dollars to acquire the rest of Hulu from Comcast after all

282
00:16:21,845 --> 00:16:25,605
Speaker 5:  of this. And now is just happily jumping back

283
00:16:25,605 --> 00:16:29,085
Speaker 5:  into bed in this exact same agreement again. It doesn't make any sense to

284
00:16:29,085 --> 00:16:29,565
Speaker 5:  me. I

285
00:16:29,565 --> 00:16:33,525
Speaker 3:  Think it, it kind of makes sense. I think Disney has been facing a lot

286
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:37,165
Speaker 3:  of existential crisises with its various bus businesses. Fair.

287
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:40,685
Speaker 3:  Particularly broadcast tv, particularly ESPN. And

288
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:44,725
Speaker 3:  this gives them like a lot of opportunity to make some money back and make

289
00:16:44,725 --> 00:16:48,085
Speaker 3:  those businesses viable again provided they don't get

290
00:16:48,495 --> 00:16:52,485
Speaker 3:  fully bodied by the FTC Fu Bo, everyone

291
00:16:52,485 --> 00:16:54,925
Speaker 3:  else involved. I'm honestly, let's

292
00:16:54,925 --> 00:16:58,445
Speaker 6:  Just be clear that no matter what the FTC does, the FTC also tends to have

293
00:16:58,445 --> 00:17:02,365
Speaker 6:  to go through the courts and the FTC has not a great track record with

294
00:17:02,365 --> 00:17:02,725
Speaker 6:  the courts

295
00:17:02,725 --> 00:17:04,005
Speaker 5:  Right now. Yeah, no. They mostly lose.

296
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:08,005
Speaker 3:  Yeah. So that's fair. That's fair. They'll get like bodied on

297
00:17:08,005 --> 00:17:11,725
Speaker 3:  Twitter or excuse me, they'll get like bodied on Threads, maybe X

298
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:13,325
Speaker 3:  possibly TikTok.

299
00:17:14,485 --> 00:17:15,925
Speaker 5:  I think Bob Iger will get over it. Yeah.

300
00:17:15,925 --> 00:17:16,725
Speaker 3:  I think he'll survive it.

301
00:17:17,385 --> 00:17:20,725
Speaker 5:  And speaking of Bob Iger, so let's, let's switch to the other story here.

302
00:17:20,885 --> 00:17:24,845
Speaker 5:  'cause I think the other thing happening at Disney right now is like

303
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:28,245
Speaker 5:  Disney is both I think to your point kind of in an existential crisis.

304
00:17:29,235 --> 00:17:32,725
Speaker 5:  It's been a weird couple of years for Disney. It's not growing as fast as

305
00:17:32,725 --> 00:17:36,325
Speaker 5:  it wanted to. It's not making much money as it wanted to. ESPN is still this

306
00:17:36,325 --> 00:17:40,285
Speaker 5:  like giant fountain of cash. Yeah. That now seems threatened. So they're

307
00:17:40,285 --> 00:17:44,165
Speaker 5:  trying to figure out all this other stuff and yet our man Bob Iger

308
00:17:44,165 --> 00:17:47,405
Speaker 5:  shows up to the earnings this week and is really like kind of feeling himself

309
00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:50,620
Speaker 5:  rolls out these big giant initiatives and it's just like, what's up everybody?

310
00:17:50,635 --> 00:17:52,445
Speaker 5:  Like we're still the Walt Disney company.

311
00:17:53,195 --> 00:17:56,485
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It was it, it had like big Bob Capic energy

312
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:59,965
Speaker 3:  particularly 'cause it was so like tech focused. A lot of the stuff he was

313
00:17:59,965 --> 00:18:02,925
Speaker 3:  saying. 'cause one of the things is that they're gonna have their own like

314
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:07,285
Speaker 3:  persistent universe tied to Fortnite, which we

315
00:18:07,285 --> 00:18:10,485
Speaker 3:  don't entirely know what that means or what that's gonna look like. We have

316
00:18:10,485 --> 00:18:14,125
Speaker 3:  a vague idea, but it's got Fortnite, persistent

317
00:18:14,365 --> 00:18:17,525
Speaker 3:  universe and Disney involved. So that sounds like money and cool.

318
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:19,565
Speaker 5:  It feels like that's gonna

319
00:18:20,075 --> 00:18:23,485
Speaker 3:  Work. Yeah. It feels like that. That's like a Bob Chappy. Like that's the

320
00:18:23,675 --> 00:18:26,245
Speaker 3:  sort of thing he wanted to do. Right? Like he wanted to turn his that's true

321
00:18:26,245 --> 00:18:29,205
Speaker 3:  company into a tech company. And so this is like, okay, this is giving them

322
00:18:29,205 --> 00:18:32,685
Speaker 3:  some inroads and taking their their like terrific IP

323
00:18:33,185 --> 00:18:36,325
Speaker 3:  and putting it out there in the Fortnite space and and making those deals.

324
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:40,645
Speaker 3:  And then you also have like, okay, they're gonna start cracking down on Disney

325
00:18:40,835 --> 00:18:44,405
Speaker 3:  plus password sharing, which is another like tech thing where it's like,

326
00:18:44,405 --> 00:18:48,325
Speaker 3:  okay, no more free rides. Get outta here. Which Bob did when he was

327
00:18:48,325 --> 00:18:50,285
Speaker 3:  like, no more free rides at Disney World or

328
00:18:50,405 --> 00:18:53,125
Speaker 5:  Whatever he did. And Bob Iger was like, how dare you do that. Yeah. That's

329
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:56,365
Speaker 5:  so hostile to our customers. We love everybody who comes to Disney World.

330
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,805
Speaker 5:  How dare you raise prices. But he

331
00:18:57,805 --> 00:19:01,565
Speaker 3:  Doesn't love people who share passwords. Yeah. Don't do it. Bob will hate

332
00:19:01,565 --> 00:19:02,485
Speaker 3:  you. Well

333
00:19:02,485 --> 00:19:05,645
Speaker 5:  Let's, let's talk about this Fortnite thing. 'cause I think this was

334
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:10,285
Speaker 5:  a surprise in a lot of ways. Disney said they're

335
00:19:10,285 --> 00:19:13,605
Speaker 5:  investing $1.5 billion, I think in Epic

336
00:19:14,825 --> 00:19:18,605
Speaker 5:  to create a, a persistent universe, as you said. Yeah. tied to

337
00:19:18,605 --> 00:19:22,285
Speaker 5:  Fortnite. Again, we have no details on this, but Disney and

338
00:19:22,435 --> 00:19:25,685
Speaker 5:  Epic have partnered a ton on stuff over the years. Yeah. There's been all

339
00:19:25,685 --> 00:19:28,965
Speaker 5:  kinds of Marvel stuff inside of Fortnite and my sense is this stuff has done

340
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:32,885
Speaker 5:  very well and feels like in a lot of ways kind of a natural

341
00:19:32,975 --> 00:19:36,205
Speaker 5:  place for Disney as a company to go. Right?

342
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:40,605
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I, the absolute first thing I thought is, oh, I kind of thought this

343
00:19:40,605 --> 00:19:41,805
Speaker 6:  had already somehow happened.

344
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:47,565
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So, I mean I think what we've seen from Fortnite over

345
00:19:47,565 --> 00:19:51,285
Speaker 5:  the last year or from Epic really is this idea that they can take the thing

346
00:19:51,285 --> 00:19:54,365
Speaker 5:  that is Fortnite and the Unreal engine underneath it and build it out into

347
00:19:54,365 --> 00:19:57,605
Speaker 5:  more stuff. Right. They did, they did Lego Fortnite. They have the racing

348
00:19:57,675 --> 00:20:00,325
Speaker 5:  game that I can't remember the name of right now, but it's very fun and everybody

349
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:03,925
Speaker 5:  should play and there's just like, there is a universe around Fortnite now.

350
00:20:04,315 --> 00:20:05,765
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That seems very powerful.

351
00:20:05,855 --> 00:20:09,325
Speaker 6:  Which also ties into, it seems like what they kind of want to be is

352
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:13,605
Speaker 6:  corporate Roblox. Yeah. Roblox is incredibly popular. Roblox

353
00:20:13,605 --> 00:20:16,765
Speaker 6:  is also just the Junkiest thing in the world. Yes. You go to a website and

354
00:20:16,765 --> 00:20:20,565
Speaker 6:  click on a thing and you find like a prison simulator made by a 13-year-old

355
00:20:21,065 --> 00:20:22,285
Speaker 3:  By my godson. Loves it.

356
00:20:22,715 --> 00:20:26,605
Speaker 6:  This is more it is. They want to be a game full

357
00:20:26,605 --> 00:20:30,165
Speaker 6:  of games and, but it's these very well recognized

358
00:20:30,465 --> 00:20:30,685
Speaker 6:  ips

359
00:20:30,985 --> 00:20:34,085
Speaker 5:  And it seems like if that's the goal, you literally could not imagine a better

360
00:20:34,085 --> 00:20:35,965
Speaker 5:  partner than Disney, right? Yeah.

361
00:20:35,965 --> 00:20:37,925
Speaker 3:  Yeah. So is is Roblox Well

362
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:38,965
Speaker 6:  Lego was a pretty good partner.

363
00:20:39,145 --> 00:20:40,365
Speaker 5:  Lego's That's true Lego. Yeah,

364
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:41,765
Speaker 3:  Because they did Lego first, right? Yeah, yeah.

365
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:45,845
Speaker 5:  Lego for and Lego Fortnite bio accounts is doing super well and makes sense.

366
00:20:45,955 --> 00:20:49,925
Speaker 5:  It's like, the thing I keep coming back to is like, I'm, I'm very old.

367
00:20:49,955 --> 00:20:53,725
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And So I play Fortnite, like, it's like a game for shooting most

368
00:20:53,725 --> 00:20:57,005
Speaker 5:  people, especially younger than me, because again, I'm very old.

369
00:20:57,525 --> 00:20:59,805
Speaker 5:  Fortnite is just like a place to hang out. It's

370
00:20:59,805 --> 00:21:01,965
Speaker 3:  Just a place to like do fun stuff. Yeah.

371
00:21:01,965 --> 00:21:05,165
Speaker 5:  And there's like, there are, there are purely creative worlds in Fortnite

372
00:21:05,165 --> 00:21:07,725
Speaker 5:  where you just go to build stuff and it's, the Roblox is kind of the same

373
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:11,645
Speaker 5:  thing, right? Like the, the being there is the point. And like

374
00:21:12,265 --> 00:21:16,205
Speaker 5:  Disney world, it just, it just is digital Disney world in so many

375
00:21:16,205 --> 00:21:19,865
Speaker 5:  ways. And I feel like Disney, I'm almost

376
00:21:19,865 --> 00:21:23,385
Speaker 5:  surprised Disney didn't try to do this itself, but it seems like a

377
00:21:23,745 --> 00:21:27,665
Speaker 5:  big, big bet on who is going to win this race that it would pick Epic to

378
00:21:27,665 --> 00:21:28,025
Speaker 5:  go with.

379
00:21:28,505 --> 00:21:31,585
Speaker 6:  I also think the scaffolding of a game, even if you're mostly hanging out,

380
00:21:31,645 --> 00:21:35,105
Speaker 6:  is really important. Just because we have seen at this point, two or three

381
00:21:35,105 --> 00:21:39,025
Speaker 6:  decades of things like MMOs tend to be really successful

382
00:21:39,095 --> 00:21:43,025
Speaker 6:  even if people are using them to get married or hang

383
00:21:43,025 --> 00:21:46,545
Speaker 6:  out with friends. Whereas things like Horizon where the

384
00:21:46,645 --> 00:21:50,425
Speaker 6:  entire goal is why don't you do the things you do in real life but you can't

385
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:54,545
Speaker 6:  actually get any of the sensory experience. It seems like people just don't

386
00:21:54,655 --> 00:21:57,665
Speaker 6:  like, obviously some people use them. Things like VR chat definitely have

387
00:21:57,905 --> 00:22:00,985
Speaker 6:  a a base. Yeah. But I think it's a little less intuitive

388
00:22:01,965 --> 00:22:03,505
Speaker 6:  why you should get into them. I

389
00:22:03,505 --> 00:22:06,905
Speaker 3:  Mean, my godson, I was back in in Texas

390
00:22:07,385 --> 00:22:11,225
Speaker 3:  recently and that night he's like, I'm gonna play Roblox with my friends.

391
00:22:11,325 --> 00:22:13,585
Speaker 3:  And we were like, all right, cool. And we off, we went off to the rodeo.

392
00:22:13,885 --> 00:22:16,465
Speaker 3:  We came back that night and he was asleep. We get up the next morning and

393
00:22:16,465 --> 00:22:20,345
Speaker 3:  he's like, my favorite game in the world is Lego Fortnite. The

394
00:22:20,345 --> 00:22:23,345
Speaker 3:  babysitter showed it to me and now I'm obsessed. And that's all he plays

395
00:22:23,365 --> 00:22:26,545
Speaker 3:  now. Like, it was just like an instant drug for him. And he was not a big

396
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:29,825
Speaker 3:  Fortnite player. He was like Roblox fan. But that like, it was just very

397
00:22:29,825 --> 00:22:32,585
Speaker 3:  clear, built that world to give him that thing and then he could be like,

398
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:35,825
Speaker 3:  there's my babysitter's house over there in Fortnite. And I was like, well

399
00:22:35,825 --> 00:22:39,545
Speaker 3:  that's a little creepy. But also I love this for you and I love that she

400
00:22:39,545 --> 00:22:43,425
Speaker 3:  has the patience to play this with you 'cause you're eight. Yeah. but it's

401
00:22:43,425 --> 00:22:47,065
Speaker 3:  like, it's a very weird, like, it's not weird, but it's just kind of

402
00:22:48,175 --> 00:22:52,155
Speaker 3:  how quick it is for, for people to just jump into it and, and

403
00:22:52,155 --> 00:22:54,115
Speaker 3:  it feels like with Disney that's just gonna be like huge.

404
00:22:55,465 --> 00:22:59,275
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean, yeah. Having the pull of like characters you

405
00:22:59,595 --> 00:23:03,475
Speaker 5:  recognize and that storytelling that Disney is so good at goes a really

406
00:23:03,475 --> 00:23:06,235
Speaker 5:  long way. but it, it breaks my brain to think about all of this. Because

407
00:23:06,235 --> 00:23:10,035
Speaker 5:  on the one hand, I think the two things that this says to me are Epic

408
00:23:10,415 --> 00:23:13,755
Speaker 5:  is winning in some vague but real way.

409
00:23:14,295 --> 00:23:18,035
Speaker 5:  And also that we're all still betting on this idea

410
00:23:18,095 --> 00:23:21,195
Speaker 5:  of the Metaverse being a thing. And I really thought we had just given up

411
00:23:21,195 --> 00:23:25,075
Speaker 5:  on that idea. Like I've made so much fun of the whole concept of the Metaverse

412
00:23:25,075 --> 00:23:27,755
Speaker 5:  for the last two years. And now I'm sitting here being like, this is an unbelievably

413
00:23:27,755 --> 00:23:28,955
Speaker 5:  good idea. Of course Disney is dating.

414
00:23:29,035 --> 00:23:32,395
Speaker 6:  I feel vindicated because I feel like that it was not me who wrote this,

415
00:23:32,415 --> 00:23:35,835
Speaker 6:  but several people just said, look, the Metaverse is just video games.

416
00:23:36,385 --> 00:23:40,155
Speaker 6:  It's just that we went through a weird period where a bunch of men in

417
00:23:40,165 --> 00:23:43,955
Speaker 6:  suits decided that we, what if it was video games, but

418
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:47,325
Speaker 6:  minus the things that people actually like about video games. I

419
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:50,925
Speaker 3:  Feel like you used to make the point a lot that Roblox was the metaverse

420
00:23:51,065 --> 00:23:54,205
Speaker 3:  and like Roblox was one of the biggest metaverses, right.

421
00:23:54,645 --> 00:23:57,965
Speaker 6:  I think And when Roblox itself decided it wanted to make that point. Yeah,

422
00:23:57,965 --> 00:24:01,925
Speaker 6:  true. That's too, it it ended up changing its name away from

423
00:24:01,925 --> 00:24:05,565
Speaker 6:  games. And that's also I think kind of silly because clearly

424
00:24:05,635 --> 00:24:08,125
Speaker 6:  what people are doing games there. Yeah.

425
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:08,725
Speaker 3:  That's what they think.

426
00:24:08,725 --> 00:24:09,445
Speaker 6:  Even they're highly social.

427
00:24:10,055 --> 00:24:10,405
Speaker 3:  Right.

428
00:24:10,745 --> 00:24:13,445
Speaker 6:  But I just, I think we've gotten away from the idea that you're going to

429
00:24:13,445 --> 00:24:17,165
Speaker 6:  work in Fortnite, which is kind of what I associate the metaverse

430
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:18,725
Speaker 6:  boom of the pandemic era with.

431
00:24:19,065 --> 00:24:21,645
Speaker 5:  So there's no like B2B Fortnite software

432
00:24:22,585 --> 00:24:26,245
Speaker 6:  Is that Roblox told all its employees to come into the office

433
00:24:26,245 --> 00:24:28,125
Speaker 6:  because you can't work in Roblox.

434
00:24:28,465 --> 00:24:29,965
Speaker 3:  We try to work in Lego Fortnite.

435
00:24:30,745 --> 00:24:33,205
Speaker 5:  I'm down. I would try that. Yeah. I do podcast in Lego Fortnite. Yeah. Come

436
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:33,685
Speaker 5:  on, let's

437
00:24:33,685 --> 00:24:35,685
Speaker 3:  Do a whole show in Lego Fortnite. We can do it.

438
00:24:36,115 --> 00:24:39,965
Speaker 5:  I'll wear Myre Meta smart glasses. Same. And we'll, we'll hang out on Lego

439
00:24:39,965 --> 00:24:43,325
Speaker 5:  Fortnite. It'll be sick. So you, you like

440
00:24:43,955 --> 00:24:46,645
Speaker 5:  this thing works for you. You're, you're in on this concept. Like,

441
00:24:46,925 --> 00:24:48,805
Speaker 6:  I mean, not me personally, but it makes sense to me.

442
00:24:48,915 --> 00:24:50,445
Speaker 5:  Okay. Why not you personally?

443
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:53,645
Speaker 6:  Because I don't like being around other people virtually.

444
00:24:54,945 --> 00:24:58,765
Speaker 5:  That's honest. Yeah. Okay. I respect that. Yeah.

445
00:24:58,845 --> 00:25:02,685
Speaker 5:  I I think this part of Disney feels

446
00:25:02,755 --> 00:25:06,365
Speaker 5:  like in many ways the biggest bet where like

447
00:25:06,515 --> 00:25:10,285
Speaker 5:  it's, they're still very much calling Disney like the Disney plus

448
00:25:10,285 --> 00:25:14,045
Speaker 5:  company. Like that is the thing. Disney needs to work, but Disney

449
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:17,885
Speaker 5:  spent I think $2 billion to do a gambling thing that

450
00:25:17,915 --> 00:25:21,485
Speaker 5:  will work because it's sports gambling and it can't help but work. It's doing

451
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:25,245
Speaker 5:  great. Yeah. But this feels like in terms of sort of big swings with

452
00:25:26,285 --> 00:25:30,205
Speaker 5:  a lot of room for error and a lot of like monstrous room for success,

453
00:25:31,185 --> 00:25:34,005
Speaker 5:  the the Epic thing seems like it could be a big Yeah.

454
00:25:34,005 --> 00:25:37,885
Speaker 3:  Because I feel like Disney when it comes to games has had like a

455
00:25:37,885 --> 00:25:41,645
Speaker 3:  very mixed run of things. Right. Like they've had some good stuff,

456
00:25:41,645 --> 00:25:42,645
Speaker 3:  they've had some bad stuff.

457
00:25:42,645 --> 00:25:45,405
Speaker 5:  That's true. Disney's not, I'm trying to think of the good, they've licensed

458
00:25:45,405 --> 00:25:46,925
Speaker 5:  games based on Disney IP and they're

459
00:25:47,235 --> 00:25:50,005
Speaker 3:  Like, they've licensed stuff. So you have like Kingdom Hearts and they're

460
00:25:50,075 --> 00:25:51,965
Speaker 6:  Many Star Wars games. All of the

461
00:25:51,965 --> 00:25:52,405
Speaker 3:  Star Wars,

462
00:25:52,405 --> 00:25:53,645
Speaker 5:  They do exist. Right.

463
00:25:53,645 --> 00:25:53,965
Speaker 3:  But then they

464
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:57,765
Speaker 5:  Are they good and fun and exciting and worth playing. Yeah. Shit.

465
00:25:57,885 --> 00:26:00,845
Speaker 3:  Disney's also had like it own, they're out there internal studios and then

466
00:26:00,845 --> 00:26:03,445
Speaker 3:  it's like moved away from those internal studios. I think under Bob chap

467
00:26:03,585 --> 00:26:07,325
Speaker 3:  it, it, it did some a lot of like heavy reorg Yeah. With the

468
00:26:07,325 --> 00:26:11,125
Speaker 3:  studios. And, and so this is like an interesting, almost like return

469
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:14,575
Speaker 3:  to form for Disney to be like Oh yeah. Games.

470
00:26:14,925 --> 00:26:18,815
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I mean the thing I associate mo weirdly most with it is, is we inspector's

471
00:26:18,815 --> 00:26:22,655
Speaker 6:  Epic Mickey. Yes. That's which I don think anyone would really call a, an

472
00:26:22,935 --> 00:26:24,255
Speaker 6:  absolutely massive financial success.

473
00:26:24,635 --> 00:26:28,095
Speaker 3:  No, but it was like, that was at the most Disney of Disney games. Right.

474
00:26:28,205 --> 00:26:31,215
Speaker 3:  Like, that was like, anytime I think of a video game of Disney, I go back

475
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:34,975
Speaker 3:  to him being like, yeah, you're gonna paint your way like into The future

476
00:26:35,085 --> 00:26:37,495
Speaker 3:  with like Mickey Mouse say

477
00:26:37,705 --> 00:26:40,775
Speaker 6:  Revel was symbolic of that period though. That was like the height of

478
00:26:41,255 --> 00:26:43,135
Speaker 6:  prestige aa single player games.

479
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:43,685
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

480
00:26:44,285 --> 00:26:47,645
Speaker 5:  I just Googled best Disney video games ever just to make sure there wasn't

481
00:26:47,645 --> 00:26:51,045
Speaker 5:  like an obvious one I was missing. And we're looking at things like Castle

482
00:26:51,105 --> 00:26:55,045
Speaker 5:  of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse from 1990 and Quack Shot

483
00:26:55,045 --> 00:26:57,725
Speaker 5:  from 1991. Like the track record's not amazing.

484
00:26:58,275 --> 00:27:02,125
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Yeah. And so they, they've got all these terrific IP that

485
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:05,965
Speaker 3:  they've been very good at selling out to other companies and now doing this

486
00:27:06,315 --> 00:27:09,805
Speaker 3:  with Epic in what seems like a, it is gonna be a much tighter

487
00:27:10,645 --> 00:27:14,405
Speaker 3:  relationship. I'll be really curious to see what happens there.

488
00:27:14,505 --> 00:27:18,485
Speaker 3:  And also if it explodes, it's gonna be like really

489
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:19,325
Speaker 3:  interesting to watch.

490
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:23,245
Speaker 5:  It's also very fun that this is one of Apple's best friends Yes.

491
00:27:23,245 --> 00:27:26,965
Speaker 5:  Partnering with one of Apple's Mortal enemies. Yeah. Which I just enjoy

492
00:27:26,965 --> 00:27:30,565
Speaker 5:  very much. Like Bob Iger and Tim Cook are going to have a lot of

493
00:27:31,035 --> 00:27:34,605
Speaker 5:  very polite, very testy phone calls over the next couple of years. And I'm

494
00:27:34,605 --> 00:27:37,005
Speaker 5:  very excited about it. Yeah. It's gonna be great times. Oh my God.

495
00:27:37,005 --> 00:27:39,165
Speaker 6:  I mean, Disney was a big launch partner. It was supposed to be for The Vision

496
00:27:39,225 --> 00:27:40,005
Speaker 6:  Pro. Yeah.

497
00:27:40,595 --> 00:27:43,525
Speaker 3:  Yeah, you can, you can go hang out, you can watch a movie like I think in,

498
00:27:43,585 --> 00:27:45,915
Speaker 3:  in Darth Vader's Palace

499
00:27:47,515 --> 00:27:48,695
Speaker 3:  for something. It's,

500
00:27:49,445 --> 00:27:52,325
Speaker 6:  I don't remember if it is that exactly, but yes, it is Disney definitely

501
00:27:52,325 --> 00:27:53,485
Speaker 6:  Star Wars themed. Yeah.

502
00:27:53,485 --> 00:27:56,885
Speaker 3:  Yeah. There's, I think there's one that's like on on the Volcano Planet where

503
00:27:56,885 --> 00:28:00,605
Speaker 3:  he lived for a while. I know far too much about Star Wars apparently.

504
00:28:00,605 --> 00:28:01,845
Speaker 3:  Judging by both of your faces.

505
00:28:02,225 --> 00:28:05,565
Speaker 6:  Oh no, I remember, I remember all those things. I'm trying to remember because

506
00:28:05,645 --> 00:28:09,605
Speaker 6:  I went into the theater and I do not remember where it was. I wanted

507
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:10,805
Speaker 6:  to say Tattoo Queen

508
00:28:10,805 --> 00:28:11,245
Speaker 3:  Is there Was there,

509
00:28:11,245 --> 00:28:13,405
Speaker 5:  Oh, there was a tattooed that I know Tattoo Queen. Yeah. I don't know if

510
00:28:13,405 --> 00:28:15,045
Speaker 5:  there were others, but there was definitely a tattoo. Maybe

511
00:28:15,045 --> 00:28:18,085
Speaker 3:  I just made up Darth Vader. I wanna watch a movie on Darth Vader's like thrown

512
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:21,405
Speaker 5:  It's a good idea in his giant house. Listen, I know for sure Bob Iger is

513
00:28:21,405 --> 00:28:23,925
Speaker 5:  listening to this podcast. So Bob, get it done. Do make it happen. Come on.

514
00:28:24,445 --> 00:28:27,645
Speaker 5:  Alright, one more thing before we switch gears and take a break here. I don

515
00:28:27,645 --> 00:28:31,605
Speaker 5:  Know If, you guys saw it, but the, the Feistiest argument of the week on

516
00:28:31,605 --> 00:28:34,365
Speaker 5:  Threads, everyone's favorite feisty social media platform

517
00:28:36,105 --> 00:28:40,045
Speaker 5:  was about Apple TV Plus and HBO. Yeah. And I just, I

518
00:28:40,045 --> 00:28:42,765
Speaker 5:  just wanna, I just wanna feel everybody out on, on how we feel about this.

519
00:28:42,785 --> 00:28:46,725
Speaker 5:  So Wired wrote a story basically positing that Apple TV

520
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:51,325
Speaker 5:  is the new HBO and that it's, it is where you go to get

521
00:28:51,795 --> 00:28:55,525
Speaker 5:  basically nothing but very good things. They don't do that much, but the

522
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:59,005
Speaker 5:  things that they do are very good. And then Lucas Shaw, who's a reporter

523
00:28:59,005 --> 00:29:02,805
Speaker 5:  at Bloomberg and very good and knows this stuff better than most quote tweeted

524
00:29:02,965 --> 00:29:05,845
Speaker 5:  somebody saying something to the effect of anyone writing something like

525
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:09,405
Speaker 5:  this should be required to say that nobody watches Apple TV Plus. And the

526
00:29:09,525 --> 00:29:13,005
Speaker 5:  feelings that that brought out in people on the internet, people

527
00:29:13,035 --> 00:29:16,565
Speaker 5:  blogged about it, people posted about it. People got very angry at Lucas.

528
00:29:17,285 --> 00:29:20,725
Speaker 5:  Somebody called him a funny name that he then quote tweeted and it just became

529
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:24,685
Speaker 5:  this whole thing. But I, I think the, the question underneath it

530
00:29:24,785 --> 00:29:28,525
Speaker 5:  is like, is Apple TV the the

531
00:29:28,585 --> 00:29:32,325
Speaker 5:  one now? Like is it, is it, is it the best one?

532
00:29:33,065 --> 00:29:34,005
Speaker 5:  Is an interesting one.

533
00:29:34,085 --> 00:29:37,605
Speaker 3:  I mean, here, here's a question if, do you like science fiction?

534
00:29:39,155 --> 00:29:39,765
Speaker 5:  Sometimes.

535
00:29:40,035 --> 00:29:42,765
Speaker 3:  Okay. Do you like weird

536
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:47,165
Speaker 3:  modernist takes on historical women's stories?

537
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:51,755
Speaker 5:  Yes. Okay. Universally,

538
00:29:52,495 --> 00:29:54,675
Speaker 3:  And do you like Ted Lasso?

539
00:29:54,675 --> 00:29:55,475
Speaker 5:  This is Scar Accurate

540
00:29:56,135 --> 00:29:59,955
Speaker 3:  If, you like those three things then like Apple TV is great.

541
00:30:00,195 --> 00:30:04,115
Speaker 3:  I think Apple TV Plus is very much like HBO in that it has

542
00:30:04,115 --> 00:30:07,315
Speaker 3:  really high standards. It maintains those really high standards. And like

543
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:11,275
Speaker 3:  HBO for a very long time, nobody watched it. Everybody's just like, like

544
00:30:11,275 --> 00:30:14,475
Speaker 3:  we, we love to be like, oh yeah, HBO Game of Thrones Game of Thrones is huge.

545
00:30:14,735 --> 00:30:18,675
Speaker 3:  It, it's massive. And a ton of people watched Game of Thrones that

546
00:30:18,675 --> 00:30:22,635
Speaker 3:  was not normal for HBO. That was a surprise

547
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:25,475
Speaker 3:  and a shock and a delight for HBO. And,

548
00:30:25,535 --> 00:30:29,475
Speaker 5:  And also I'm pretty sure that like the Game of Thrones ratings would've

549
00:30:29,475 --> 00:30:32,075
Speaker 5:  been like a pretty bad episode at the Big Bang Theory. No,

550
00:30:32,075 --> 00:30:34,275
Speaker 6:  No, there were still, yeah. Isn't, I just don't say a conflict between the

551
00:30:34,275 --> 00:30:35,515
Speaker 6:  two things you just mentioned. Yeah,

552
00:30:35,515 --> 00:30:36,275
Speaker 5:  That's totally fair.

553
00:30:36,785 --> 00:30:40,755
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I think they were doing like 10, 11 million average viewers for,

554
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:44,715
Speaker 3:  which was massive for HBO. Yeah. And at the time for broadcast TV was

555
00:30:44,715 --> 00:30:48,515
Speaker 3:  like pretty Okay. But you know, you think about the Mash finale

556
00:30:48,575 --> 00:30:51,995
Speaker 3:  or was it Grey's? My, my big one is Grey's Anatomy Season two

557
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:55,315
Speaker 3:  was over 20 million people watching it. So you're like,

558
00:30:56,475 --> 00:31:00,335
Speaker 3:  no. Yeah. I, I, 20 million people did not watch the,

559
00:31:00,335 --> 00:31:02,615
Speaker 3:  the latest season of for all mankind. They should have.

560
00:31:03,615 --> 00:31:06,455
Speaker 6:  I guess the thing that interests me about this comparison is that a lot of

561
00:31:06,555 --> 00:31:10,495
Speaker 6:  the way that I experienced early, like Prestige TV and HBO shows was through

562
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:14,015
Speaker 6:  a critic's ecosystem that doesn't exist anymore. That a lot of

563
00:31:14,355 --> 00:31:17,655
Speaker 6:  the, I think you've written about this, that there was the idea that

564
00:31:17,815 --> 00:31:20,895
Speaker 6:  nobody's, like, not that many people are watching this show, but every critic,

565
00:31:20,915 --> 00:31:23,375
Speaker 6:  you know, is watching this show. Yes. Everything on the internet is writing

566
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:26,895
Speaker 6:  about it. There are these whole little ecosystems. I'm really curious what

567
00:31:26,895 --> 00:31:27,695
Speaker 6:  that looks like for Apple.

568
00:31:28,205 --> 00:31:31,855
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And I think Apple's been doing kind of okay with it. That's one of

569
00:31:31,855 --> 00:31:34,895
Speaker 3:  the reasons it's gone so far into science fiction is because like you have

570
00:31:34,895 --> 00:31:38,215
Speaker 3:  Monarch, which is a big show that's based in, in the Godzilla world, and

571
00:31:38,215 --> 00:31:42,015
Speaker 3:  it does ask you to care about the Godzilla movies. You shouldn't,

572
00:31:43,075 --> 00:31:44,855
Speaker 5:  But it, it wants you to so bad. It wants

573
00:31:44,855 --> 00:31:47,455
Speaker 3:  You to, and the show is, the show is legitimately good. I think it's got

574
00:31:47,455 --> 00:31:51,095
Speaker 3:  a great like time ahead of it. And same with for all mankind,

575
00:31:51,315 --> 00:31:55,125
Speaker 3:  but it doesn't really, like, they're not really hitting

576
00:31:55,305 --> 00:31:58,725
Speaker 3:  at the same kind of like pace that traditionally those critically

577
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,965
Speaker 3:  acclaimed like shows like we don't have a television without pity anymore.

578
00:32:02,325 --> 00:32:06,205
Speaker 3:  AV club is very, very different than it was 10, 15 years ago, shit,

579
00:32:06,205 --> 00:32:09,725
Speaker 3:  five years ago. And, and so You don't have those like

580
00:32:09,725 --> 00:32:12,885
Speaker 3:  conversations happening. Instead you have like people on TikTok

581
00:32:13,495 --> 00:32:17,045
Speaker 3:  going through and judging Emma Stone's favorite movies and saying why they

582
00:32:17,045 --> 00:32:20,845
Speaker 3:  suck, which is like not particularly useful criticism. Or

583
00:32:20,845 --> 00:32:24,525
Speaker 3:  you have, what is it? You have Threads and, and people making fun of

584
00:32:24,685 --> 00:32:28,365
Speaker 3:  Lucas for something. He was right about like, nobody watches Apple TV except

585
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:29,965
Speaker 3:  for B and David I think. Yeah.

586
00:32:29,965 --> 00:32:32,165
Speaker 5:  Well there were, there were a lot of people who responded being like, well

587
00:32:32,165 --> 00:32:34,365
Speaker 5:  Apple TV Plus has 25 million subscribers.

588
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:36,445
Speaker 3:  That's different than how many people viewers.

589
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:39,925
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. They all watch Ted Lasso. Yeah. They, I'll give you that. They

590
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:40,725
Speaker 5:  did all watch Ted Lasso

591
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:44,205
Speaker 3:  And then they, they they maybe watched, did they watch Foundation? Probably

592
00:32:44,225 --> 00:32:45,005
Speaker 3:  not Severance.

593
00:32:45,075 --> 00:32:47,525
Speaker 5:  They all said they watched Foundation. Yeah. They watched like an episode

594
00:32:47,525 --> 00:32:48,885
Speaker 5:  and a half and they're like, yeah, totally. The

595
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:52,525
Speaker 3:  Only person in the world who watched all of Foundation is Dan Seaford.

596
00:32:53,785 --> 00:32:55,685
Speaker 5:  And he's, and then they had to leave The Verge because of it.

597
00:32:55,685 --> 00:32:58,525
Speaker 3:  Yeah. That's why he's not at The Verge anymore is because we found out he

598
00:32:58,525 --> 00:33:00,165
Speaker 3:  watched all of Foundation and we were like, wow.

599
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:04,845
Speaker 5:  No, but Addie I think you're the point you're making about critics made me

600
00:33:04,845 --> 00:33:08,205
Speaker 5:  think of something which is that like, even still, like I think about a,

601
00:33:08,285 --> 00:33:11,125
Speaker 5:  a website like The Ringer, which is a lot of really good pop culture coverage.

602
00:33:11,315 --> 00:33:15,285
Speaker 5:  They sort of instinctively cover every new

603
00:33:15,515 --> 00:33:19,405
Speaker 5:  like 9:00 PM on Sunday HBO show. Right. Because there's just an assumption

604
00:33:19,435 --> 00:33:23,045
Speaker 5:  that this show sort of matters, right? Whether it's the White Lotus or

605
00:33:23,095 --> 00:33:26,925
Speaker 5:  succession or any of those kind of handful of times

606
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,645
Speaker 5:  a year shows that gets out.

607
00:33:28,645 --> 00:33:30,405
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I'm getting that true detective right now. Yeah,

608
00:33:30,405 --> 00:33:34,045
Speaker 5:  Totally. And there's just a like cultural

609
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:37,085
Speaker 5:  assumption that this show is relevant because it is like the Sunday night

610
00:33:37,085 --> 00:33:40,845
Speaker 5:  show on HBO Apple TV definitely doesn't have that. No.

611
00:33:41,045 --> 00:33:44,965
Speaker 5:  Like I could not tell you what day any Apple TV show comes out, which I think

612
00:33:44,965 --> 00:33:46,565
Speaker 5:  is like a meaningful thing. Was

613
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:47,965
Speaker 3:  Ted Lasso Tuesdays?

614
00:33:48,245 --> 00:33:51,005
Speaker 5:  I honestly couldn't tell you like the, the only streaming one in general

615
00:33:51,165 --> 00:33:55,085
Speaker 5:  I remember was the first season of the Mandalorian on

616
00:33:55,085 --> 00:33:58,405
Speaker 5:  Disney Plus came out Friday mornings. And I had friends who would

617
00:33:58,715 --> 00:34:02,125
Speaker 5:  literally like wake up early in the morning on Friday morning to watch the

618
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:05,765
Speaker 5:  show in order to like be able to talk about it at work. And so like

619
00:34:06,305 --> 00:34:09,285
Speaker 5:  that's the level that you get to. And I think HBO just sort of is granted

620
00:34:09,285 --> 00:34:13,205
Speaker 5:  that level of, of cultural relevance, even if it's not real.

621
00:34:13,275 --> 00:34:16,885
Speaker 5:  Like we were just looking this up before we started and 4 million people

622
00:34:16,885 --> 00:34:20,805
Speaker 5:  watched the series finale of succession, like one of the great TV

623
00:34:20,815 --> 00:34:24,605
Speaker 5:  shows that every critic on the internet was writing about, which is like

624
00:34:24,675 --> 00:34:28,125
Speaker 5:  half the number of people who watch an episode of Chicago Fire, like everybody's

625
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:29,965
Speaker 5:  95th favorite TV show.

626
00:34:31,585 --> 00:34:35,125
Speaker 5:  But nothing has hit that sort of cultural

627
00:34:35,565 --> 00:34:39,285
Speaker 5:  relevance that HBO just gets to have because it's an

628
00:34:39,385 --> 00:34:42,885
Speaker 5:  HBO. Yeah. And even that Apple TV has a lot of good shows. I actually think,

629
00:34:42,885 --> 00:34:46,845
Speaker 5:  like If, you just took 50 random shows from

630
00:34:46,845 --> 00:34:50,445
Speaker 5:  any streaming service. I would bet that Apple TVs are better

631
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:53,245
Speaker 5:  than any random 50 on any other restric.

632
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:56,165
Speaker 3:  And that's what there were, I mean that was like the kind of the core argument

633
00:34:56,285 --> 00:35:00,165
Speaker 3:  I think of that HBO piece. The Apple TV plus piece was that

634
00:35:00,345 --> 00:35:03,845
Speaker 3:  hey, it like pound for pound. It's, it's, it's hitting above its weight.

635
00:35:03,845 --> 00:35:06,285
Speaker 3:  Like it's, it's doing well. Yeah, I think that's probably right. But it's

636
00:35:06,315 --> 00:35:09,845
Speaker 3:  also, it's not doing true detective numbers. It's not doing

637
00:35:09,955 --> 00:35:13,485
Speaker 3:  Chicago fire numbers. And historically Prestige TV

638
00:35:13,835 --> 00:35:17,725
Speaker 3:  doesn't do Chicago fire numbers. That's why part of why it's Prestige TV

639
00:35:17,905 --> 00:35:21,125
Speaker 3:  is because a lot of people say, I don't wanna watch that. It's too smart.

640
00:35:21,435 --> 00:35:22,205
Speaker 5:  It's too prestigious.

641
00:35:22,355 --> 00:35:23,125
Speaker 3:  It's too prestigious.

642
00:35:23,485 --> 00:35:26,445
Speaker 5:  I will say though, and we need to take a break, but criminal record on Apple

643
00:35:26,465 --> 00:35:30,405
Speaker 5:  TV Plus Kicks Ass, I'm pretty sure it's not gonna land the plane and it's

644
00:35:30,405 --> 00:35:33,365
Speaker 5:  not gonna make any sense at the end, but it's like five episodes in and they've

645
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:37,165
Speaker 5:  all been great. So I, love this one. Highly recommend, but I might take that

646
00:35:37,165 --> 00:35:39,285
Speaker 5:  back. Anyway, we need to take a break. We'll be right back.

647
00:37:42,265 --> 00:37:45,045
Speaker 5:  All right, we're back. Let's talk Vision. Pro.

648
00:37:46,225 --> 00:37:49,645
Speaker 5:  So as you're listening to this on Friday, it's now been a week since The

649
00:37:49,645 --> 00:37:52,445
Speaker 5:  Vision Pro came out into the world. We've got a bunch of news, but

650
00:37:53,295 --> 00:37:56,765
Speaker 5:  Addie I just want you to like describe the vibes of what you've seen from

651
00:37:56,845 --> 00:37:58,405
Speaker 5:  a week of Vision Pro being in the world.

652
00:37:59,505 --> 00:38:02,885
Speaker 6:  It feels like I've seen sort of three things. One is

653
00:38:03,405 --> 00:38:06,445
Speaker 6:  everyone noticing all of the little annoying things about The, Vision Pro

654
00:38:07,045 --> 00:38:10,925
Speaker 6:  that NELI and the rest of us noticed. Two is people

655
00:38:10,925 --> 00:38:14,685
Speaker 6:  going, oh wow, I'm like a developer or I'm a person who is interested

656
00:38:14,705 --> 00:38:18,605
Speaker 6:  in technology and this thing is a technologically interesting system, both

657
00:38:18,605 --> 00:38:21,845
Speaker 6:  of which were, I feel like kind of prefigured by our review. Yes. The third

658
00:38:21,985 --> 00:38:25,045
Speaker 6:  is this thing's really expensive. This is a cloud symbol.

659
00:38:26,665 --> 00:38:30,445
Speaker 5:  Agreed. And that is the one I should have seen coming more

660
00:38:30,445 --> 00:38:34,405
Speaker 5:  than I did. I think I sort of took it as this thing is

661
00:38:34,405 --> 00:38:38,245
Speaker 5:  really expensive. Maybe it'll be kind of

662
00:38:38,295 --> 00:38:41,965
Speaker 5:  ridiculous and g to wear outside. Holy God. Was I wrong?

663
00:38:42,305 --> 00:38:43,485
Speaker 5:  No. Oh man. Was I wrong?

664
00:38:43,485 --> 00:38:46,325
Speaker 3:  You're right. You're still right. Don't don't. It's still Gsh.

665
00:38:46,585 --> 00:38:49,445
Speaker 5:  I'm right in the abstract, Don, I'm wrong. In actual reality, don't

666
00:38:49,445 --> 00:38:49,925
Speaker 3:  Give people power.

667
00:38:50,965 --> 00:38:54,405
Speaker 5:  I mean, what was it? I think, I think Jake posted something on the site.

668
00:38:55,065 --> 00:38:58,965
Speaker 5:  The headline of the quick post he did was just, it's been 10 hours and

669
00:38:58,965 --> 00:39:02,805
Speaker 5:  this is a video of a man in his car driving while

670
00:39:02,805 --> 00:39:06,085
Speaker 5:  wearing a Vision Pro, which like we knew was gonna happen. And we got a bunch

671
00:39:06,085 --> 00:39:09,605
Speaker 5:  of cyber track, wasn't impressed. Posts from people saying, boy, you guys

672
00:39:09,605 --> 00:39:12,565
Speaker 5:  called this. And I kept being like, this was not a tough call guys. Like

673
00:39:12,565 --> 00:39:15,925
Speaker 5:  this was what it was gonna be. But now we've seen, we've seen people walking

674
00:39:15,925 --> 00:39:19,805
Speaker 5:  around the mall, you see people on the subway. Like you're totally right.

675
00:39:19,805 --> 00:39:22,565
Speaker 5:  That being the person with this out in the world

676
00:39:23,975 --> 00:39:26,845
Speaker 5:  makes you interesting. And I don't think that'll last, but it's very much

677
00:39:26,845 --> 00:39:27,565
Speaker 5:  where right now I,

678
00:39:27,645 --> 00:39:30,965
Speaker 6:  I feel like there are two ways this could go. One is the iPhone, which having

679
00:39:30,985 --> 00:39:34,445
Speaker 6:  an iPhone in the early days, like if somebody else had one, you were like,

680
00:39:34,445 --> 00:39:38,245
Speaker 6:  oh my God, iPhone. Totally. The other way is, I remember Google Glass,

681
00:39:38,725 --> 00:39:41,805
Speaker 6:  I remember the period like the week or two where Google Glass, it was like,

682
00:39:41,805 --> 00:39:45,405
Speaker 6:  oh, this is so exotic. All of these models where it, it's like this

683
00:39:45,405 --> 00:39:49,045
Speaker 6:  incredibly exciting sci-fi thing. And it looked a lot, a lot cooler than

684
00:39:49,165 --> 00:39:52,485
Speaker 6:  The Vision Pro, frankly. Yes. And then within a month or two you were getting

685
00:39:52,485 --> 00:39:53,725
Speaker 6:  banned from bars. Yeah.

686
00:39:54,105 --> 00:39:57,565
Speaker 3:  No, no. I I a hundred percent it's gonna be that side because right now all

687
00:39:57,565 --> 00:40:01,285
Speaker 3:  the people doing it aren't using The Vision Pro correctly, which was pointed

688
00:40:01,285 --> 00:40:04,445
Speaker 3:  out to me by someone in our office who has a Vision Pro.

689
00:40:04,445 --> 00:40:08,405
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah. If you're walking down the street with a Vision Pro on just like

690
00:40:08,405 --> 00:40:10,605
Speaker 5:  pinch, pinching the air, you're not doing anything. Yeah.

691
00:40:10,725 --> 00:40:14,165
Speaker 3:  Apparently you can only have one. Sorry. Apparently you can only have one

692
00:40:14,165 --> 00:40:17,325
Speaker 3:  window open and you have to hold it like this all the time. So theoretically

693
00:40:17,345 --> 00:40:18,525
Speaker 3:  the only way to actually make it,

694
00:40:18,525 --> 00:40:19,285
Speaker 5:  It's carrying your window

695
00:40:19,555 --> 00:40:20,285
Speaker 6:  Down the street,

696
00:40:20,715 --> 00:40:24,365
Speaker 3:  Walking around like that. And I'm like, yeah, you guys, and he got so mad,

697
00:40:24,545 --> 00:40:27,445
Speaker 3:  he was like, they're not doing it right. You can only have one window at

698
00:40:27,445 --> 00:40:30,245
Speaker 3:  a time. And he was like walking through the office showing us how to make

699
00:40:30,465 --> 00:40:30,845
Speaker 3:  it works.

700
00:40:31,165 --> 00:40:34,285
Speaker 5:  I was kind of hoping it would be like, you wake up in the morning and you

701
00:40:34,285 --> 00:40:37,685
Speaker 5:  like walk to the subway, just sort of leaving browser tabs behind you. Yeah.

702
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:41,365
Speaker 5:  And then you just pick them all up on the way home. You just, you come back

703
00:40:41,365 --> 00:40:43,805
Speaker 5:  out, you put it on and it's like, oh cool. There's all this stuff I had to

704
00:40:43,805 --> 00:40:46,965
Speaker 5:  do today. Like, that sounds awesome. That is super not how it works.

705
00:40:47,105 --> 00:40:47,325
Speaker 3:  No,

706
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,525
Speaker 6:  I would just like to note also, this is a thing that I have had many people

707
00:40:50,525 --> 00:40:54,445
Speaker 6:  mention about pass through is I am waiting someday

708
00:40:54,475 --> 00:40:58,445
Speaker 6:  this thing is going to crash while you are wearing it, it is going to be

709
00:40:58,695 --> 00:41:02,685
Speaker 6:  incredibly annoying to suddenly be blind. Yeah, yeah. While you are driving.

710
00:41:03,285 --> 00:41:03,565
Speaker 6:  Right.

711
00:41:04,015 --> 00:41:06,565
Speaker 3:  Don't drive with it. Yeah. Don't be dumb.

712
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:10,485
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that's a good, just quick PSA don't do that. Yeah. Just don't, don't

713
00:41:10,485 --> 00:41:10,965
Speaker 5:  do that. Well

714
00:41:10,965 --> 00:41:14,885
Speaker 3:  I think like when, when when the Wall Street Journal did theirs,

715
00:41:15,325 --> 00:41:19,005
Speaker 3:  when Joanna did her her review and she did like a ski slope thing, they just

716
00:41:19,195 --> 00:41:22,245
Speaker 3:  shut down the ski slope. 'cause they were like, oh, we can't have other people

717
00:41:22,245 --> 00:41:26,205
Speaker 3:  like on this slope with her. And what if she goes blind right

718
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:29,685
Speaker 3:  into somebody can't have that happen. So it's like, oh boy, don't, don't

719
00:41:29,685 --> 00:41:30,045
Speaker 3:  drive with it.

720
00:41:30,205 --> 00:41:33,285
Speaker 5:  I like that Joanna shows up and she's like, guys, I have an N-D-A-I-I have

721
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:35,725
Speaker 5:  to do this separately. And they're like, don't worry, we don't won't anywhere

722
00:41:35,745 --> 00:41:39,685
Speaker 5:  run around you anyway. Like you're cool. but it

723
00:41:39,685 --> 00:41:43,325
Speaker 5:  doesn seem like the people have landed on the thing that

724
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:46,485
Speaker 5:  we've all been talking about for the better part of a year now, which is

725
00:41:46,485 --> 00:41:49,925
Speaker 5:  like, this thing is a, is a television that seems to be overwhelmingly the

726
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:53,965
Speaker 5:  takeaway is like, like you're saying, there's some cool technological

727
00:41:53,965 --> 00:41:57,885
Speaker 5:  stuff going on here in in certain like engineering ways. This thing is

728
00:41:58,235 --> 00:42:02,165
Speaker 5:  masterful and amazing, kind of useless for a lot of things,

729
00:42:02,945 --> 00:42:06,885
Speaker 5:  but holy crap, is it a great TV watching experience That's like the

730
00:42:06,885 --> 00:42:08,885
Speaker 5:  thing I've seen overwhelmingly seems to be that

731
00:42:09,215 --> 00:42:12,885
Speaker 6:  Which is driving me insane because it is a TV that I cannot

732
00:42:13,225 --> 00:42:17,085
Speaker 6:  use in the way that I would use a TV because it is single user, the single

733
00:42:17,115 --> 00:42:20,925
Speaker 6:  user this of this thing has been driving me just up a wall for a week.

734
00:42:21,035 --> 00:42:22,925
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Oh no, I completely agree. And you're

735
00:42:22,925 --> 00:42:24,245
Speaker 3:  Getting mad, like watching you think here

736
00:42:24,265 --> 00:42:28,045
Speaker 6:  I'm, I'm angry. Like I'm genuinely angry because I have

737
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:31,965
Speaker 6:  so many electronics and I look, I share them with a person.

738
00:42:32,155 --> 00:42:35,445
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And the point is, we are both able to use this thing

739
00:42:36,105 --> 00:42:39,805
Speaker 6:  and I can't, it's not just like, oh, it's fitted for your face or whatever.

740
00:42:39,915 --> 00:42:43,245
Speaker 6:  It's, you literally can't use the interface. Right. It won't recognize your

741
00:42:43,245 --> 00:42:43,925
Speaker 6:  eyes. Yeah.

742
00:42:43,945 --> 00:42:47,525
Speaker 3:  We we haven't all been using Eli's review unit because

743
00:42:48,425 --> 00:42:49,005
Speaker 3:  we can't.

744
00:42:49,135 --> 00:42:52,485
Speaker 6:  Right. I mean, you can start a guest, like, to be clear, the thing that happens

745
00:42:52,505 --> 00:42:56,165
Speaker 6:  is there's one person who can own this thing. It recognizes them. You can

746
00:42:56,165 --> 00:42:59,045
Speaker 6:  start a guest session by pressing the button and then you have to do this

747
00:42:59,045 --> 00:43:02,805
Speaker 6:  like minute long calibration process of picking colored Dots out. Yeah. And

748
00:43:02,805 --> 00:43:06,725
Speaker 6:  then it can recognize you and it can recognize you basically until it swaps

749
00:43:06,725 --> 00:43:10,605
Speaker 6:  back. And then you have to start a new guest session. So there is gets to

750
00:43:10,605 --> 00:43:13,005
Speaker 6:  be one designated TV user in the house.

751
00:43:13,985 --> 00:43:15,685
Speaker 3:  That's it. No one else watches TV in the house.

752
00:43:15,845 --> 00:43:18,005
Speaker 6:  Everyone else has to spend a minute getting their TV ready.

753
00:43:18,265 --> 00:43:21,365
Speaker 5:  And I do think I, I was less worried about this

754
00:43:21,985 --> 00:43:25,605
Speaker 5:  before it launched than I have become now. I'm with you. I think it's, it's

755
00:43:25,685 --> 00:43:28,565
Speaker 5:  actually the single biggest thing missing from The. Vision Pro right now

756
00:43:28,625 --> 00:43:32,325
Speaker 5:  is decent multi-user support. Because if it is a

757
00:43:32,325 --> 00:43:36,085
Speaker 5:  television and or a game console, it's gonna be a thing you pick up

758
00:43:36,545 --> 00:43:40,445
Speaker 5:  put on use for a bit and then put down. Right. It is, it is a

759
00:43:40,445 --> 00:43:44,125
Speaker 5:  like very much a, an episodic device like all headsets are right now. Yeah.

760
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:46,605
Speaker 5:  Like Chris Grant made this point on this show a while ago, and I haven't

761
00:43:46,605 --> 00:43:49,205
Speaker 5:  stopped thinking about it ever since. I was like, oh, why aren't there VR

762
00:43:49,205 --> 00:43:51,485
Speaker 5:  games that are fun to play for eight hours? And he was because like, who

763
00:43:51,485 --> 00:43:54,285
Speaker 5:  the hell wants to play a VR game for eight hours? Like, I think that's right.

764
00:43:54,385 --> 00:43:58,045
Speaker 5:  And so the idea that I take off my headset and put it down on my couch and

765
00:43:58,045 --> 00:44:01,765
Speaker 5:  the headset is the television and my wife can't then put it on

766
00:44:02,665 --> 00:44:06,165
Speaker 5:  is stupid. Like, there there are people who are saying,

767
00:44:06,505 --> 00:44:10,445
Speaker 5:  you know, it's, it's lonely and you can't watch TV alone

768
00:44:10,545 --> 00:44:14,125
Speaker 5:  or you have to watch TV alone in it. And I both think that's true and also

769
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:16,685
Speaker 5:  kind of overstated. Like a lot of people spend a lot of time watching TV

770
00:44:16,685 --> 00:44:20,645
Speaker 5:  alone. I think that's basically Okay. Yeah. Somewhere Richard Lawler is

771
00:44:20,645 --> 00:44:24,485
Speaker 5:  listening to this feeling very vindicated. But this idea

772
00:44:24,485 --> 00:44:27,965
Speaker 5:  that it, it would be like no one else in my house is allowed to watch

773
00:44:29,105 --> 00:44:31,285
Speaker 5:  my TV ever. It's just bad.

774
00:44:31,285 --> 00:44:31,725
Speaker 3:  It's just fifties.

775
00:44:32,235 --> 00:44:35,245
Speaker 6:  Well, or like no one's allowed to use a my PlayStation.

776
00:44:35,575 --> 00:44:36,845
Speaker 5:  Right? Yeah, exactly.

777
00:44:37,185 --> 00:44:40,885
Speaker 3:  So like ri rich multi kid families,

778
00:44:41,785 --> 00:44:44,605
Speaker 3:  you, you remember, did you ever have friends like that when you were a kid?

779
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:47,325
Speaker 3:  And they'd be like, oh, this is my PlayStation. My brother has his own PlayStation.

780
00:44:47,325 --> 00:44:48,285
Speaker 3:  What? No. You'd be

781
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:49,485
Speaker 6:  Like, I did not have this. Now

782
00:44:49,865 --> 00:44:52,925
Speaker 3:  Why? Why do I have that? Why do I have my own PlayStation? And your parents

783
00:44:52,925 --> 00:44:56,765
Speaker 3:  would be like, because they cost money. Get out. Yeah. Go go

784
00:44:56,785 --> 00:44:57,285
Speaker 3:  mow the yard.

785
00:44:57,315 --> 00:44:59,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah. They'd be like, go outside. That's your PlayStation. And because

786
00:44:59,245 --> 00:45:03,045
Speaker 6:  It's extremely easy to switch because every other entertainment focused computing

787
00:45:03,045 --> 00:45:06,125
Speaker 6:  device on the market, except maybe the iPad recognizes you are supposed to

788
00:45:06,125 --> 00:45:07,205
Speaker 6:  have multiple profiles.

789
00:45:07,645 --> 00:45:09,405
Speaker 3:  I just like watching Addie get so bad

790
00:45:09,405 --> 00:45:12,405
Speaker 5:  About, I was talking, I was talking to Jake on our team earlier. The fun

791
00:45:12,405 --> 00:45:14,845
Speaker 5:  of being in the office is I get to just randomly get in arguments with people

792
00:45:15,025 --> 00:45:17,565
Speaker 5:  and he got very heated and was started, was saying that we should start giving

793
00:45:17,565 --> 00:45:21,245
Speaker 5:  every iPad a zero out of 10 until they give proper multi-user support.

794
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:25,205
Speaker 5:  Mm. And I'm just like, hell yeah dude. Like that's, it's a

795
00:45:25,325 --> 00:45:27,645
Speaker 5:  stance. Let's go for it. No multi users are

796
00:45:27,645 --> 00:45:28,405
Speaker 3:  Nothing more, only zeros.

797
00:45:28,515 --> 00:45:32,405
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I support this. I'm into this. Any other Vision Pro stuff we

798
00:45:32,405 --> 00:45:34,045
Speaker 5:  should talk about? don don't wanna linger on this. We've talked a lot about

799
00:45:34,045 --> 00:45:35,245
Speaker 5:  Vision Pro on the show. We, we,

800
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:39,005
Speaker 3:  We, I fixed it. Did a big breakdown. Oh yeah. And

801
00:45:39,825 --> 00:45:43,405
Speaker 3:  boy howdy is the, the pixels per inch. Awesome.

802
00:45:43,985 --> 00:45:45,765
Speaker 5:  Is it nuts? Yeah. It us through the numbers.

803
00:45:45,955 --> 00:45:49,605
Speaker 3:  It's 3,386 pixels per inch.

804
00:45:49,795 --> 00:45:50,485
Speaker 5:  That seems high.

805
00:45:50,515 --> 00:45:54,205
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It's it's only, it's only a few, a few pixels

806
00:45:54,275 --> 00:45:57,805
Speaker 3:  less than what you would expect for like four, like what 4K

807
00:45:57,805 --> 00:46:01,685
Speaker 3:  requires. Which is why it's not technically a 4K display, but it's like,

808
00:46:01,705 --> 00:46:02,085
Speaker 3:  but it's

809
00:46:02,155 --> 00:46:03,605
Speaker 5:  This big. Yeah. Yeah.

810
00:46:04,105 --> 00:46:07,485
Speaker 3:  In fact that it's an inch. Wow. And it has that many pixels on it is is kind

811
00:46:07,485 --> 00:46:08,325
Speaker 3:  of insane. Do

812
00:46:08,325 --> 00:46:11,325
Speaker 6:  Do you wanna give the Quest three and the, the other numbers that were in

813
00:46:11,325 --> 00:46:14,405
Speaker 6:  our post? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I gotcha. A useful comparison. Yeah.

814
00:46:14,425 --> 00:46:17,325
Speaker 3:  And, and by comparison, the, the Meta Quest three has

815
00:46:17,505 --> 00:46:21,245
Speaker 3:  1,218 PPI and then the

816
00:46:21,665 --> 00:46:24,965
Speaker 3:  HT vi, the HTC Vive Pro has

817
00:46:25,075 --> 00:46:28,965
Speaker 3:  950 and If, you want something that you actually look at

818
00:46:29,155 --> 00:46:33,125
Speaker 3:  more than like once a day. The iPhone 15

819
00:46:33,305 --> 00:46:36,965
Speaker 3:  Pro Max has 460 PPI. Wow. So this thing is,

820
00:46:38,225 --> 00:46:38,845
Speaker 3:  and they

821
00:46:38,845 --> 00:46:42,725
Speaker 6:  Point out that pixels per degree is a lot of, is in some ways more accurate.

822
00:46:42,725 --> 00:46:46,485
Speaker 6:  That's like the degree of field of view that Right. Pixels

823
00:46:46,485 --> 00:46:50,445
Speaker 6:  because it headset is like this thing where it just blows up a gigantic,

824
00:46:51,405 --> 00:46:54,565
Speaker 6:  a small screen to a gigantic field. Right. But even those numbers are also

825
00:46:54,565 --> 00:46:54,685
Speaker 6:  pretty

826
00:46:54,685 --> 00:46:57,565
Speaker 3:  Good. Yeah, it is. It's like the numbers here are just

827
00:46:58,485 --> 00:47:01,885
Speaker 3:  outrageously high and you're like, okay, so this thing is like

828
00:47:02,715 --> 00:47:06,525
Speaker 3:  damn good. Yeah. 'cause the pixels per degree, The, Vision Pro is at 34

829
00:47:07,205 --> 00:47:10,765
Speaker 3:  PPD, which is lower than the 94 and the 95

830
00:47:10,765 --> 00:47:14,125
Speaker 3:  ratings for the iPhone 15 from 15

831
00:47:14,475 --> 00:47:17,845
Speaker 3:  feet away. Or No, the iPhone 15 from a foot away

832
00:47:18,265 --> 00:47:22,125
Speaker 3:  or the standard 65 inch 4K TV from 6.5

833
00:47:22,155 --> 00:47:25,805
Speaker 3:  feet away, So, I, guess low is lower number better here for the PPD

834
00:47:26,305 --> 00:47:26,965
Speaker 3:  for the pixel

835
00:47:26,965 --> 00:47:27,365
Speaker 6:  Higher

836
00:47:27,425 --> 00:47:27,805
Speaker 3:  Per degree.

837
00:47:27,805 --> 00:47:29,125
Speaker 5:  Higher, higher, higher, higher. Typically

838
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:33,125
Speaker 6:  Better. I think that the point is that it is still not

839
00:47:33,125 --> 00:47:36,365
Speaker 6:  going to get you the kind of clarity that you get from like looking at Okay.

840
00:47:36,525 --> 00:47:40,405
Speaker 6:  A very small field of view for a small screen. but

841
00:47:40,405 --> 00:47:43,245
Speaker 6:  it is still, I don't know that I have the numbers here, but it is still pretty

842
00:47:43,245 --> 00:47:46,925
Speaker 6:  good for comparing it against other headsets. Yeah.

843
00:47:47,065 --> 00:47:50,925
Speaker 5:  But it also makes pretty clear how hard a technical problem this is

844
00:47:50,925 --> 00:47:54,485
Speaker 5:  because, I mean, Neela, I was talking about this when we talked about his

845
00:47:54,485 --> 00:47:58,445
Speaker 5:  review. It's like the, the comparison to like blood cells, which means

846
00:47:58,445 --> 00:48:02,405
Speaker 5:  nothing. but it is, it is technologically insane. Yeah. That Apple got this

847
00:48:02,405 --> 00:48:06,245
Speaker 5:  many pixels onto a screen this small and it's still not enough to do

848
00:48:06,625 --> 00:48:09,965
Speaker 5:  the thing that we need to do in order for this stuff to be really realistic,

849
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:13,405
Speaker 5:  right? Like that is the scale of this problem is you can have

850
00:48:13,915 --> 00:48:17,365
Speaker 5:  that many pixels on that small space, but because it's so close to your eyes

851
00:48:17,665 --> 00:48:21,365
Speaker 5:  and because it is literally trying to simulate reality, the bar is just

852
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:25,325
Speaker 5:  so, so, so high that even that Apple has done like

853
00:48:25,345 --> 00:48:29,165
Speaker 5:  an order of magnitude more than anyone else has been able to do, we're still

854
00:48:29,165 --> 00:48:32,365
Speaker 5:  not there. Like, it just, it the road for really making this stuff amazing

855
00:48:32,505 --> 00:48:33,725
Speaker 5:  is so long. It's crazy.

856
00:48:33,835 --> 00:48:37,805
Speaker 6:  It's also yeah, a reason why pixels are just not the be all and end

857
00:48:37,805 --> 00:48:40,565
Speaker 6:  all of headsets. Totally. Like things like field of View turn out to be a

858
00:48:40,565 --> 00:48:42,485
Speaker 6:  really big deal with The Vision Pro. Yeah.

859
00:48:42,515 --> 00:48:45,885
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. It's been really interesting watching everybody go through,

860
00:48:46,685 --> 00:48:50,445
Speaker 5:  I would say the kind of normal honeymoon phase of a Vision Pro where you

861
00:48:50,445 --> 00:48:54,245
Speaker 5:  get it on, you do the first couple of things, you get the setup, you learn

862
00:48:54,245 --> 00:48:57,365
Speaker 5:  how to do, the pinch, the eye tracking, and it's like, oh my God, it works.

863
00:48:57,505 --> 00:49:01,285
Speaker 5:  And it feels amazing. And then very slowly you start to notice like, oh,

864
00:49:01,325 --> 00:49:04,885
Speaker 5:  I can see the edges of, of my vision here as I'm going. And then, oh,

865
00:49:05,665 --> 00:49:09,045
Speaker 5:  the pinching doesn't really work and you just like, slowly but surely the

866
00:49:09,045 --> 00:49:12,965
Speaker 5:  things that don't quite work start to creep in. But everybody seems to have

867
00:49:13,435 --> 00:49:17,245
Speaker 5:  that very first 20 minutes in the headset where it's like, oh my God,

868
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:19,405
Speaker 5:  I'm never taking this off. This is the greatest thing that's ever happened.

869
00:49:19,675 --> 00:49:19,965
Speaker 5:  That

870
00:49:19,965 --> 00:49:22,845
Speaker 6:  Is also the impression that I feel like everyone who put on a VR headset

871
00:49:22,865 --> 00:49:24,285
Speaker 6:  in 2013 got. Yeah,

872
00:49:24,305 --> 00:49:25,125
Speaker 5:  That's probably true.

873
00:49:25,185 --> 00:49:28,805
Speaker 3:  No, that's that's true. Yeah. I, I was talking to a friend who he did when,

874
00:49:29,035 --> 00:49:32,325
Speaker 3:  when I worked with him, we, we worked on the, the original Oculus Quest

875
00:49:32,625 --> 00:49:34,685
Speaker 3:  review. Was it the Oculus Quest? The Rift?

876
00:49:34,745 --> 00:49:35,405
Speaker 6:  The Rift was the

877
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:36,725
Speaker 5:  First the original Rift. Yeah. Yeah.

878
00:49:36,825 --> 00:49:40,165
Speaker 3:  And we worked on the original Rift review and he's like, wow. I, I kind of

879
00:49:40,165 --> 00:49:43,805
Speaker 3:  called it like, then I said basically my review is a lot like all of the

880
00:49:43,805 --> 00:49:47,645
Speaker 3:  The Vision Pro reviews right now. And it's like, look back. Yeah.

881
00:49:47,665 --> 00:49:51,045
Speaker 3:  No, he's, he's right. Like, like when you finally try really cool vr, you're

882
00:49:51,045 --> 00:49:53,725
Speaker 3:  like, oh wow, this is awesome. And then it kind of goes away, which is why

883
00:49:53,725 --> 00:49:57,685
Speaker 3:  nobody talks about VR cardboard anymore. 'cause that was really cool when

884
00:49:57,685 --> 00:50:01,645
Speaker 3:  you first put on like the cardboard, right. And then five minutes later you're

885
00:50:01,645 --> 00:50:02,525
Speaker 3:  like, okay, what do I do now?

886
00:50:02,915 --> 00:50:06,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I think a lot of this stuff is just a question of how long it takes

887
00:50:06,145 --> 00:50:10,045
Speaker 5:  to reveal its problems to you. Yes. And The Vision Pro to its

888
00:50:10,045 --> 00:50:13,685
Speaker 5:  credit seems to take a pretty long time to reveal its problems to you. But

889
00:50:13,685 --> 00:50:17,245
Speaker 5:  right about the time it starts getting heavy and the battery starts dying

890
00:50:17,705 --> 00:50:20,565
Speaker 5:  and the gestures don't work quite so well. And

891
00:50:20,565 --> 00:50:24,365
Speaker 3:  You remember you spent 300 and or $3,500 on it.

892
00:50:24,655 --> 00:50:28,245
Speaker 5:  Every once in a while. Somebody has just been posting in all caps

893
00:50:28,245 --> 00:50:31,845
Speaker 5:  $3,500. And I feel like this is now my legacy on The Vergecast. I'm very

894
00:50:31,845 --> 00:50:32,285
Speaker 5:  happy about it.

895
00:50:32,565 --> 00:50:35,845
Speaker 6:  I do feel bad. You mentioned Google Cardboard. I feel really bad for all

896
00:50:35,845 --> 00:50:39,605
Speaker 6:  of the people who spent a bunch of time making 180 and 360

897
00:50:39,605 --> 00:50:43,405
Speaker 6:  degree videos, I guess, including us many years ago. And Apple's just like,

898
00:50:43,405 --> 00:50:46,125
Speaker 6:  no, they're not good enough. You're not looking at 'em. Yeah. Can't look

899
00:50:46,125 --> 00:50:47,125
Speaker 3:  At 'em. They look like potatoes.

900
00:50:47,295 --> 00:50:51,205
Speaker 5:  Which is wild because it's not like Apple is going way

901
00:50:51,205 --> 00:50:55,085
Speaker 5:  out of its way to ensure every experience you have in The

902
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:58,685
Speaker 5:  Vision Pro is like perfect, insane. And a lot of people are having issues

903
00:50:58,685 --> 00:51:02,605
Speaker 5:  with, you know, motion sickness and, and some of the like problems

904
00:51:02,605 --> 00:51:06,165
Speaker 5:  with the ways that apps work. And there are not that many

905
00:51:06,165 --> 00:51:10,005
Speaker 5:  guardrails except on videos that Apple doesn't think look good enough. And

906
00:51:10,005 --> 00:51:11,685
Speaker 5:  I think that's kind of a silly set of guardrails.

907
00:51:12,315 --> 00:51:16,205
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's, it's frustrating. Yeah. Especially that it's even just on the

908
00:51:16,205 --> 00:51:19,405
Speaker 6:  web. Like the web is the place I think of as you should be able to just go

909
00:51:19,505 --> 00:51:22,405
Speaker 6:  and experience a thing, even if the quality is not great. Yeah.

910
00:51:22,645 --> 00:51:26,285
Speaker 5:  If I'm willing to go onto that stupid keyboard and type www

911
00:51:26,505 --> 00:51:30,365
Speaker 5:  dot YouTube dot com slash 360 videos that are gonna make me

912
00:51:30,365 --> 00:51:33,725
Speaker 5:  throw up. Like, that is my right. Yeah. This is the internet. I should be

913
00:51:33,725 --> 00:51:36,565
Speaker 5:  allowed to dot that. Alright. Anyway, we should move on

914
00:51:37,345 --> 00:51:41,245
Speaker 5:  before we get to the laying ground. One more thi one and a half more things

915
00:51:41,365 --> 00:51:44,605
Speaker 5:  I want to talk about. I'm only giving Alex a half, we'll half get to that

916
00:51:44,605 --> 00:51:48,405
Speaker 5:  in a second. Bluesky opened up this week, which I think is interesting.

917
00:51:49,435 --> 00:51:53,325
Speaker 5:  This is the, the new Twittery social network that all

918
00:51:53,325 --> 00:51:56,005
Speaker 5:  the shit posters went to and have been kind of hanging out in secret for

919
00:51:56,005 --> 00:51:59,725
Speaker 5:  the last year. And now Bluesky is opened to everybody.

920
00:52:00,345 --> 00:52:04,245
Speaker 5:  The Jay, their CEO did an interview with Alex Heath talking about how they

921
00:52:04,245 --> 00:52:05,725
Speaker 5:  plan to make money and

922
00:52:07,235 --> 00:52:09,845
Speaker 5:  what do you, what do you guys make of this? Is like, is Bluesky, do you know,

923
00:52:09,865 --> 00:52:10,565
Speaker 5:  is Bluesky coming?

924
00:52:10,825 --> 00:52:14,445
Speaker 3:  How I fully understood, I I didn't, I hadn't looked at the website yet.

925
00:52:14,765 --> 00:52:18,525
Speaker 3:  I was scrolling through Threads and I saw a bunch of post saying I'm on Bluesky,

926
00:52:18,825 --> 00:52:21,845
Speaker 3:  but I'll still be posting here on Threads. And that's how I knew that Bluesky

927
00:52:21,845 --> 00:52:25,725
Speaker 3:  had opened. And I was like, Hmm, is it good If that's how I find

928
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,885
Speaker 3:  out is just a bunch of people on Threads saying, I'll I'll still be here.

929
00:52:28,885 --> 00:52:30,245
Speaker 3:  I'll still be on both posting on both.

930
00:52:31,395 --> 00:52:33,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's interesting. You're on Bluesky, right? I'm on

931
00:52:33,685 --> 00:52:37,565
Speaker 6:  Bluesky. I've, I went to Mastodon first. I still use Mastodon.

932
00:52:37,795 --> 00:52:41,365
Speaker 6:  I've slipped to Bluesky just because Blue Skies felt much more low stakes.

933
00:52:41,425 --> 00:52:41,645
Speaker 6:  It

934
00:52:42,005 --> 00:52:42,205
Speaker 5:  Interesting.

935
00:52:42,675 --> 00:52:46,205
Speaker 6:  Part of it was that it was private, that it was just much smaller.

936
00:52:47,065 --> 00:52:51,005
Speaker 6:  but it does feel like where a bunch of a Twitter people that I liked

937
00:52:51,035 --> 00:52:54,565
Speaker 6:  went, and B, it feels like I don't have to be

938
00:52:54,805 --> 00:52:57,845
Speaker 6:  contributing to a greater social good, which was the feeling I ended up getting

939
00:52:57,845 --> 00:52:58,885
Speaker 6:  from Mastodon. Yes.

940
00:52:59,725 --> 00:53:03,525
Speaker 5:  Mastodon is very much like a, an NGO designed

941
00:53:03,705 --> 00:53:07,605
Speaker 5:  to make the world a better place through lots of developmental

942
00:53:08,365 --> 00:53:09,125
Speaker 5:  documentation, which

943
00:53:09,125 --> 00:53:12,485
Speaker 6:  I'm sure is not true for absolutely every instance. Like all of the usual

944
00:53:12,675 --> 00:53:16,165
Speaker 6:  caveats. I just got the sense that I was like, is this really a good enough

945
00:53:16,525 --> 00:53:19,445
Speaker 6:  constructive enough thing? There were just so many people talking about you

946
00:53:19,445 --> 00:53:22,765
Speaker 6:  just, you shouldn't be, you shouldn't be cluttering up our timelines with

947
00:53:22,765 --> 00:53:26,285
Speaker 6:  all of this frivolous stuff. Yeah. And then I went to Bluesky and Drill was

948
00:53:26,285 --> 00:53:26,965
Speaker 6:  there. It's

949
00:53:26,965 --> 00:53:28,925
Speaker 5:  Just all frivolous. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

950
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:31,645
Speaker 6:  I, and well also a decent amount of law Twitter ended up there.

951
00:53:31,995 --> 00:53:35,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Fair. Yeah. I, part of me thinks it's a success

952
00:53:36,015 --> 00:53:39,845
Speaker 5:  story if they all end up being their own things and different,

953
00:53:39,845 --> 00:53:43,205
Speaker 5:  and I think the weirdest part is gonna be the people who

954
00:53:44,075 --> 00:53:47,645
Speaker 5:  kind of commit to posting everywhere and try to be the same thing

955
00:53:47,645 --> 00:53:51,325
Speaker 5:  everywhere. I just don't think it's gonna work. And I think these things

956
00:53:51,325 --> 00:53:54,605
Speaker 5:  have all developed such different norms that, like

957
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:58,685
Speaker 5:  the vibe on Bluesky is unrecognizable to the vibe on

958
00:53:59,275 --> 00:54:03,205
Speaker 5:  Threads or on Mastodon largely in good ways, but mostly

959
00:54:03,265 --> 00:54:07,125
Speaker 5:  in just extremely chaotic ways. There's just a lot of people making inside

960
00:54:07,125 --> 00:54:09,605
Speaker 5:  jokes that you don't understand if you've been off of Bluesky for more than

961
00:54:09,605 --> 00:54:13,205
Speaker 5:  10 minutes. But that's a good thing. Right. And I think that part of the

962
00:54:13,205 --> 00:54:16,965
Speaker 5:  big bet that the social web is making right now that is that there

963
00:54:17,065 --> 00:54:21,045
Speaker 5:  can be lots of winners and lots of things to come out, but in some

964
00:54:21,045 --> 00:54:23,965
Speaker 5:  ways I think Bluesky taking this long to open up was both the best and worst

965
00:54:23,965 --> 00:54:26,885
Speaker 5:  thing that happened to Bluesky. Like Bluesky has this very

966
00:54:27,715 --> 00:54:30,845
Speaker 5:  like mature vibe now, right? Like Bluesky knows what it is,

967
00:54:31,905 --> 00:54:34,965
Speaker 5:  but the downside of that is it knows what it is for this small group of people

968
00:54:34,965 --> 00:54:38,765
Speaker 5:  who have been there together, alone, like on a desert island for

969
00:54:38,925 --> 00:54:42,885
Speaker 5:  a year while Threads became sort of the clear mainstream choice.

970
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:47,965
Speaker 5:  Mastodon continues to be Mastodon, Threads in Mastodon are eventually

971
00:54:47,965 --> 00:54:50,845
Speaker 5:  gonna be integrated. And so it just kind of feels like Bluesky is

972
00:54:52,115 --> 00:54:55,845
Speaker 5:  just relegated to forever being an also ran.

973
00:54:56,185 --> 00:54:56,405
Speaker 5:  Yes.

974
00:54:57,085 --> 00:55:00,525
Speaker 3:  I mean that's why I didn't, I, I, I have an account but I don't really

975
00:55:00,525 --> 00:55:04,045
Speaker 3:  participate in Bluesky as much just 'cause my brain can only handle so much

976
00:55:04,045 --> 00:55:07,925
Speaker 3:  social media and So I don't wanna, like, I, I am not gonna be one of

977
00:55:07,925 --> 00:55:10,685
Speaker 3:  those people on a bunch of different platforms and always talking. And that

978
00:55:10,685 --> 00:55:14,645
Speaker 3:  one I was like, I just feel like this one is not gonna be the big one. I

979
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:17,245
Speaker 3:  think a lot of really cool people are there, but a lot of the really cool

980
00:55:17,245 --> 00:55:20,965
Speaker 3:  people there, I'll just text Yeah. And talk to them because they're my friends.

981
00:55:21,225 --> 00:55:21,445
Speaker 3:  On

982
00:55:21,445 --> 00:55:25,325
Speaker 6:  The other hand, I kind of, well a, I do wish that it were much easier to

983
00:55:25,325 --> 00:55:28,085
Speaker 6:  have a single interface where I could at least check all these things. Yes.

984
00:55:28,545 --> 00:55:32,525
Speaker 6:  At the same time, that's very annoying to me. But I also, I don't know,

985
00:55:32,685 --> 00:55:36,285
Speaker 6:  I hope we get more sites that are small and niche and

986
00:55:36,995 --> 00:55:40,405
Speaker 6:  that I can just go to for a small subset of things. Bluesky in some ways

987
00:55:40,405 --> 00:55:43,725
Speaker 6:  reminds me of Tumblr in its post hegemonic era.

988
00:55:44,395 --> 00:55:48,085
Speaker 3:  Yeah. In its current era where it's just like a couple of folks, you know,

989
00:55:48,185 --> 00:55:49,965
Speaker 3:  and they're being really weird and that's great. Yeah.

990
00:55:50,665 --> 00:55:53,605
Speaker 5:  Now Tumblr's in the phase where every time somebody mentions Tumblr you go,

991
00:55:53,605 --> 00:55:57,005
Speaker 5:  oh, Tumblr. Yeah. And that is kind of what Bluesky feels like already,

992
00:55:57,225 --> 00:55:58,965
Speaker 6:  Except that I guess one of them allows porn.

993
00:55:59,475 --> 00:56:00,685
Speaker 5:  Well, you know, Tumblr,

994
00:56:01,065 --> 00:56:04,485
Speaker 6:  I'm really curious how long it's going to last because I am just

995
00:56:04,975 --> 00:56:08,965
Speaker 6:  Apple and Google exerted so much pressure a few years

996
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:12,805
Speaker 6:  ago in getting not saved for work stuff either paywall or take,

997
00:56:12,805 --> 00:56:16,645
Speaker 6:  or not paywall, but like either walled away or taken down. Yeah. The Bluesky

998
00:56:16,645 --> 00:56:17,565
Speaker 6:  getting on it feels

999
00:56:19,385 --> 00:56:19,605
Speaker 6:  odd.

1000
00:56:19,995 --> 00:56:23,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean, to some extent I think you could make a pretty, pretty good

1001
00:56:23,485 --> 00:56:27,165
Speaker 5:  argument that Bluesky never should have opened up that main, that that sort

1002
00:56:27,165 --> 00:56:30,885
Speaker 5:  of managing and slowing down that growth was a good thing for

1003
00:56:30,885 --> 00:56:33,725
Speaker 5:  Bluesky. Like, it grew too fast in the beginning. Like remember when people

1004
00:56:33,725 --> 00:56:36,925
Speaker 5:  were hacking the invite codes and a ton of people came on all at once, it

1005
00:56:36,925 --> 00:56:40,565
Speaker 5:  became a mess. Like the, the norms changed. People started doing weird stuff.

1006
00:56:40,625 --> 00:56:44,205
Speaker 5:  The platforms started breaking in weird ways. The health thread ruined everyone's

1007
00:56:44,205 --> 00:56:47,765
Speaker 5:  life and forgot about the health. There was I think a a moment where they

1008
00:56:47,765 --> 00:56:51,685
Speaker 5:  said, okay, we're gonna, we're gonna slow this down on purpose. And I think

1009
00:56:51,685 --> 00:56:53,685
Speaker 5:  that was the right thing to do then. And I think you could make the case,

1010
00:56:53,685 --> 00:56:57,485
Speaker 5:  it's the right thing to do. Now the problem is that runs against all of

1011
00:56:57,635 --> 00:57:01,325
Speaker 5:  Blue Sky's stated goals. Right. Which are to build a social

1012
00:57:01,645 --> 00:57:04,965
Speaker 5:  protocol for the web that is bigger than Bluesky and to kind of reinvent

1013
00:57:04,965 --> 00:57:06,805
Speaker 5:  the way that we do everything. Which I think at this point

1014
00:57:08,465 --> 00:57:12,245
Speaker 5:  it, it lost, right? Like we're, we're in a VHS Beta Max war with,

1015
00:57:12,995 --> 00:57:16,525
Speaker 5:  with at Protocol, which runs Bluesky and Activity Pub, which is underneath

1016
00:57:16,525 --> 00:57:20,245
Speaker 5:  Mastodon, which Threads is gonna adopt. And it almost

1017
00:57:20,245 --> 00:57:23,405
Speaker 5:  doesn't matter anymore. I don't think which one is better Activity Pub is

1018
00:57:23,405 --> 00:57:27,125
Speaker 5:  gonna win. Yes. It's just gonna win. And I think if I'm

1019
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:30,925
Speaker 5:  Bluesky, you either have to look at it and say, okay, do we want to keep

1020
00:57:31,125 --> 00:57:34,965
Speaker 5:  fighting this fight that we are now so far behind? Or do we go,

1021
00:57:34,995 --> 00:57:38,045
Speaker 5:  like you're talking about and try to be something different and not try to

1022
00:57:38,045 --> 00:57:41,645
Speaker 5:  build the next great social media company, but like lean into this thing

1023
00:57:41,645 --> 00:57:43,685
Speaker 5:  that we already are, which I think could be very cool,

1024
00:57:44,225 --> 00:57:47,565
Speaker 3:  But doesn't at some point they have to make money. Yeah.

1025
00:57:48,415 --> 00:57:49,085
Speaker 5:  Presumably.

1026
00:57:49,745 --> 00:57:53,605
Speaker 3:  And like I think that's gonna be a real challenge if they

1027
00:57:53,605 --> 00:57:56,125
Speaker 3:  don't grow. I, and I I totally agree with you. I think having

1028
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:59,165
Speaker 5:  These masson runs on like a Patreon Yeah. I don know you can get, you can

1029
00:57:59,165 --> 00:58:00,685
Speaker 5:  get by for a pretty long time. That's

1030
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:00,725
Speaker 3:  True.

1031
00:58:01,025 --> 00:58:04,525
Speaker 6:  The source projects Yeah. Used to be taken for granted as just things that

1032
00:58:04,525 --> 00:58:04,965
Speaker 6:  could exist.

1033
00:58:05,155 --> 00:58:09,005
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And there's a way to run this stuff as like an okay business that

1034
00:58:09,005 --> 00:58:12,725
Speaker 5:  doesn't involve, like if Bluesky wants to be a

1035
00:58:12,965 --> 00:58:16,925
Speaker 5:  trillion dollar company, there are certain things you have to do in pursuit

1036
00:58:16,925 --> 00:58:20,445
Speaker 5:  of that. Right. Right. But I think my hope is for the next phase of the social

1037
00:58:20,465 --> 00:58:23,365
Speaker 5:  web that not everybody tries to be a trillion dollar company. That there

1038
00:58:23,365 --> 00:58:26,885
Speaker 5:  are going to be lots and lots of much smaller ways to do this stuff. Fingers

1039
00:58:26,885 --> 00:58:27,205
Speaker 3:  Crossed.

1040
00:58:27,345 --> 00:58:30,685
Speaker 5:  And I think Bluesky, I could be totally wrong because there are a lot of

1041
00:58:30,685 --> 00:58:34,405
Speaker 5:  things Bluesky does really well and it's a, it's a nice looking app. Everybody

1042
00:58:34,405 --> 00:58:37,645
Speaker 5:  on there is, that's where Drill is. It's like, it is the most fun

1043
00:58:38,185 --> 00:58:41,405
Speaker 5:  social platform on the internet. Like I really believe that.

1044
00:58:42,145 --> 00:58:46,125
Speaker 5:  but it is such an unusual place now that I feel like if I had

1045
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:49,045
Speaker 5:  never been there before, it would show up and it would, it would feel very

1046
00:58:49,045 --> 00:58:49,285
Speaker 5:  strange.

1047
00:58:50,025 --> 00:58:53,765
Speaker 6:  It also feels like a place that you kind of can only really grasp If, you

1048
00:58:53,765 --> 00:58:54,405
Speaker 6:  were on Twitter.

1049
00:58:55,675 --> 00:58:59,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But like, but like on Twitter, like capital o on

1050
00:58:59,315 --> 00:59:03,085
Speaker 5:  Twitter and, and God help you If. you were one of those

1051
00:59:03,085 --> 00:59:06,445
Speaker 5:  people. It really is. It's full of like decade old Twitter jokes

1052
00:59:06,795 --> 00:59:10,165
Speaker 5:  that If you don't get you, you sort of need a glossary to help you understand

1053
00:59:10,285 --> 00:59:11,525
Speaker 5:  what the hell is going on in Bluesky.

1054
00:59:12,195 --> 00:59:12,485
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

1055
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:17,565
Speaker 5:  It's funny. But, we'll, we'll see. I I support all of this. I

1056
00:59:17,565 --> 00:59:20,645
Speaker 5:  hope Bluesky works. I just don't think it's going to All right. Alex,

1057
00:59:22,105 --> 00:59:23,725
Speaker 5:  I'm so afraid to do this Right now

1058
00:59:24,445 --> 00:59:26,245
Speaker 3:  I have, I'm so nervous. I have a piece of news here, here

1059
00:59:26,245 --> 00:59:28,165
Speaker 5:  About what's gonna happen. I have a piece of this before we take a break.

1060
00:59:28,225 --> 00:59:29,285
Speaker 5:  We have one more

1061
00:59:30,815 --> 00:59:33,965
Speaker 5:  story we should talk about for such a short amount of time,

1062
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:38,325
Speaker 3:  Shortest amount of time. And, and in fact it says Alex be careful in

1063
00:59:38,345 --> 00:59:42,285
Speaker 3:  all caps. As some of you know, I did make a bet

1064
00:59:42,285 --> 00:59:45,285
Speaker 3:  with some people that at some point we would probably see

1065
00:59:46,285 --> 00:59:50,125
Speaker 3:  a picture of Elon Musk in little Elon.

1066
00:59:51,205 --> 00:59:52,885
Speaker 3:  I I don, I don't wanna say any other way. I

1067
00:59:52,885 --> 00:59:53,805
Speaker 5:  Already hate this. Yeah.

1068
00:59:54,105 --> 00:59:57,885
Speaker 3:  And we're one step closer because they are currently

1069
00:59:58,075 --> 01:00:02,005
Speaker 3:  dealing with a problem on the platform on x the

1070
01:00:02,205 --> 01:00:05,285
Speaker 3:  platform where there is a non-consensual photo of a celebrity

1071
01:00:06,905 --> 01:00:07,845
Speaker 3:  in the nude. And

1072
01:00:08,045 --> 01:00:10,605
Speaker 5:  I mean, it's Drake's nudes. Yeah. Like we can just say this. It's like there's,

1073
01:00:10,605 --> 01:00:13,445
Speaker 5:  there's everyone on the internet knows this. This is why this became a story.

1074
01:00:13,625 --> 01:00:13,845
Speaker 5:  It

1075
01:00:13,845 --> 01:00:17,605
Speaker 3:  Led to, it led to X being the number one app on the Apple

1076
01:00:17,785 --> 01:00:21,685
Speaker 3:  App store. I wanna just be very clear, non-consensual

1077
01:00:21,695 --> 01:00:25,645
Speaker 3:  nudes are not Okay. Don't do that. But also, I hate how close

1078
01:00:25,745 --> 01:00:29,565
Speaker 3:  we are getting to the, the big nude where I

1079
01:00:29,565 --> 01:00:32,805
Speaker 3:  win a bet. I don't wanna win this bet. It's a terrible bet.

1080
01:00:33,365 --> 01:00:34,365
Speaker 5:  Everyone loses that bet

1081
01:00:34,765 --> 01:00:36,165
Speaker 3:  Everyone loses when I win this bet.

1082
01:00:37,735 --> 01:00:41,645
Speaker 3:  Clean up your Act X. Like stop, stop letting non-consensual stuff

1083
01:00:41,675 --> 01:00:43,925
Speaker 3:  just be all over your platform. That's not cool.

1084
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:47,805
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Well, and that, and then all this stuff, we, we were kind of

1085
01:00:47,955 --> 01:00:51,605
Speaker 5:  bookended with stories about the Taylor Swift deep fakes being all over

1086
01:00:51,965 --> 01:00:55,445
Speaker 5:  x first there were, there were non-consensual

1087
01:00:55,445 --> 01:00:59,205
Speaker 5:  problematic, non-consensual DeepFakes. And now there's a deepfake of Taylor

1088
01:00:59,205 --> 01:01:03,085
Speaker 5:  Swift endorsing Donald Trump that's all over the platform. X is

1089
01:01:03,085 --> 01:01:05,125
Speaker 5:  just an odd, odd place and

1090
01:01:05,235 --> 01:01:08,645
Speaker 3:  It's, yeah, it's, it's an old kind of internet, but not in a good way,

1091
01:01:08,725 --> 01:01:12,485
Speaker 3:  particularly If you like, have any vested interest in

1092
01:01:12,645 --> 01:01:14,285
Speaker 3:  X and don't wanna be sued. Yeah.

1093
01:01:14,825 --> 01:01:18,365
Speaker 6:  I'm saying it reminds me of Reddit back in the mid-teens

1094
01:01:18,985 --> 01:01:21,245
Speaker 6:  during the period where they were extremely laci faire.

1095
01:01:21,675 --> 01:01:21,965
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

1096
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:26,325
Speaker 5:  But at least Reddit would like say out loud that they

1097
01:01:26,325 --> 01:01:29,125
Speaker 5:  didn't want these things. They wouldn't do anything about it for a long time,

1098
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:33,045
Speaker 5:  but at least they would say, we don't want this awful stuff to be all

1099
01:01:33,045 --> 01:01:36,245
Speaker 5:  over our platform. Yeah. You do not get that sense from the leadership at

1100
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:36,845
Speaker 5:  X right now.

1101
01:01:37,275 --> 01:01:41,165
Speaker 6:  They're, yeah. Well I think that Elon is definitely operating in a

1102
01:01:41,165 --> 01:01:44,765
Speaker 6:  landscape that comes after Reddit's cleanup in which you're

1103
01:01:45,115 --> 01:01:49,085
Speaker 6:  Yeah. You're, you can't even just say, don don't endorse this, but it's here.

1104
01:01:49,355 --> 01:01:52,525
Speaker 6:  It's like you have to have full throated endorsement of Yes. The Nazis

1105
01:01:53,195 --> 01:01:56,725
Speaker 6:  even that like, look, yes, he is condemned the Nazis. He also just talks

1106
01:01:56,725 --> 01:02:00,045
Speaker 6:  to a bunch of far-Right people and spreads his own conspiracy theories. And

1107
01:02:00,045 --> 01:02:03,805
Speaker 6:  there's just a bunch of stuff that even that Reddit people

1108
01:02:04,195 --> 01:02:07,645
Speaker 6:  like hung out with and invited the guy from creep shots into

1109
01:02:08,215 --> 01:02:12,165
Speaker 6:  their events. Like they didn't end up doing that. Right.

1110
01:02:12,515 --> 01:02:16,205
Speaker 5:  Yeah. No, I I think that's right. And it's just bad times

1111
01:02:16,345 --> 01:02:16,565
Speaker 5:  all

1112
01:02:16,565 --> 01:02:19,925
Speaker 3:  Around. Yeah. It's just bad times. I don't wanna win this bet. Don't

1113
01:02:20,265 --> 01:02:23,925
Speaker 3:  please. I like, I went from kind of wanting to win the bet because I like

1114
01:02:23,925 --> 01:02:27,885
Speaker 3:  to be smug and win things to like, I don't actually wanna win

1115
01:02:27,885 --> 01:02:29,205
Speaker 3:  this bet with Liz. Don't.

1116
01:02:29,435 --> 01:02:33,005
Speaker 5:  It's a terrible bet. And also to everyone who is asking for trending topics

1117
01:02:33,065 --> 01:02:36,845
Speaker 5:  to be on Threads. You don't want that, don't click on

1118
01:02:36,845 --> 01:02:40,565
Speaker 5:  trending topics. 'cause something bad will probably happen when you do it.

1119
01:02:40,635 --> 01:02:43,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah. All right. We need to take a break then we're gonna go back, do a lightning

1120
01:02:43,445 --> 01:02:43,605
Speaker 5:  ground.

1121
01:02:46,525 --> 01:02:48,285
Speaker 10:  Remember November 7th, 2020,

1122
01:02:50,585 --> 01:02:54,565
Speaker 11:  You had people discovering that Joe Biden was going to

1123
01:02:54,565 --> 01:02:58,525
Speaker 11:  win the election and just bursting out of their houses and going out into

1124
01:02:58,525 --> 01:02:58,885
Speaker 11:  the streets

1125
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:05,365
Speaker 11:  and dancing and, and making noise and high fiving each other.

1126
01:03:07,665 --> 01:03:09,605
Speaker 12:  The best day of my life, best day the year

1127
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:13,885
Speaker 11:  This was happening in cities across the country. People were celebrating

1128
01:03:13,905 --> 01:03:17,205
Speaker 11:  in a way you just don't see anymore. And, and I thought that was an important

1129
01:03:17,205 --> 01:03:20,965
Speaker 11:  moment to recall because it captured the joy that people felt

1130
01:03:21,015 --> 01:03:24,765
Speaker 11:  about Biden winning, which was not really about Biden's

1131
01:03:24,765 --> 01:03:28,365
Speaker 11:  program. People were just thrilled that Donald Trump was going to go,

1132
01:03:28,875 --> 01:03:32,725
Speaker 13:  January 20th is gonna be day at the

1133
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:36,645
Speaker 13:  White House because we're gonna get rid of the orange pizza trash

1134
01:03:36,645 --> 01:03:37,565
Speaker 13:  Donald Trump,

1135
01:03:37,945 --> 01:03:41,565
Speaker 10:  How people went from jubilant to totally jaded and how

1136
01:03:41,615 --> 01:03:45,445
Speaker 10:  Biden could maybe win 'em back this week on today

1137
01:03:45,445 --> 01:03:46,005
Speaker 10:  explained.

1138
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:55,235
Speaker 5:  All right, we're back. Let's not talk about Drake's nudes anymore.

1139
01:03:56,285 --> 01:03:58,515
Speaker 5:  Let's do a laying around. Addie you go first. What do you have?

1140
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:02,515
Speaker 6:  So the FCC has a log against robocalls

1141
01:04:03,095 --> 01:04:06,955
Speaker 6:  and this is said you cannot have artificial voices. Do

1142
01:04:07,155 --> 01:04:08,395
Speaker 6:  artificial voices include AI voices,

1143
01:04:11,035 --> 01:04:12,635
Speaker 3:  Artificial voices? You would in the Yes.

1144
01:04:12,635 --> 01:04:13,755
Speaker 5:  You would work. My instinct is yes.

1145
01:04:14,175 --> 01:04:17,595
Speaker 6:  And they agreed. Good. Okay. Cool. Good for them. Cool. Nice. They declared

1146
01:04:17,605 --> 01:04:21,075
Speaker 6:  today that the, that AI generated voice clones in

1147
01:04:21,075 --> 01:04:24,955
Speaker 6:  robocalls definitely do violate the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. That

1148
01:04:24,955 --> 01:04:27,795
Speaker 6:  means they can crack down on them. This is partly relevant because the election

1149
01:04:27,795 --> 01:04:31,715
Speaker 6:  season is heating up and New Hampshire has just released the

1150
01:04:31,745 --> 01:04:35,515
Speaker 6:  results of an investigation about who was making

1151
01:04:35,525 --> 01:04:38,155
Speaker 6:  phone calls pretending to be Joe Biden. It's companies in Texas.

1152
01:04:38,545 --> 01:04:40,195
Speaker 3:  Yeah, it was companies in my hometown.

1153
01:04:40,545 --> 01:04:42,595
Speaker 5:  Okay. You need to be less excited about this. I mean,

1154
01:04:42,595 --> 01:04:44,595
Speaker 3:  Look, anytime I see my hometown, this is not

1155
01:04:44,635 --> 01:04:46,755
Speaker 5:  A cool like, ah, that's, those are my people moments.

1156
01:04:46,935 --> 01:04:50,115
Speaker 3:  If. You're not from like New York or like a big town and you and you see

1157
01:04:50,115 --> 01:04:52,915
Speaker 3:  like, like I'm from Fort Worth, I see Fort Worth and a name. I'm like, oh

1158
01:04:52,945 --> 01:04:54,715
Speaker 3:  cool. And, and then I closer you

1159
01:04:55,115 --> 01:04:58,515
Speaker 5:  A little closer. Fort Worth, Texas. Like, it's like a tiny town in Iowa.

1160
01:04:59,235 --> 01:05:02,755
Speaker 5:  I mean it's like a large city right next to Dallas, Texas. Oh,

1161
01:05:02,755 --> 01:05:04,395
Speaker 3:  This is sort of flattering. Thank you. Yeah.

1162
01:05:04,515 --> 01:05:06,115
Speaker 6:  I think of it as being a pretty, pretty big place.

1163
01:05:06,185 --> 01:05:09,635
Speaker 3:  Look when you're next to Dallas, like they're always over there talking about

1164
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:13,195
Speaker 3:  how cool they are and how you suck. I see. So we have some inferiority

1165
01:05:13,195 --> 01:05:15,835
Speaker 3:  complexes over in Fort Worth, right? Well we believe, and apparently we also

1166
01:05:15,835 --> 01:05:16,635
Speaker 3:  have spams

1167
01:05:18,155 --> 01:05:21,725
Speaker 3:  calling pretending to be Joe Biden. And they were saying like, don't vote.

1168
01:05:21,725 --> 01:05:22,325
Speaker 3:  Right? Yeah.

1169
01:05:22,325 --> 01:05:24,965
Speaker 6:  You gotta save your vote a thing that your doesn't make any sense. Save your

1170
01:05:24,965 --> 01:05:25,165
Speaker 6:  vote. Oh wow.

1171
01:05:26,545 --> 01:05:26,965
Speaker 3:  Thanks

1172
01:05:27,095 --> 01:05:30,205
Speaker 5:  Texas. Wait, didn't, wasn't that a whole story in the last election cycle

1173
01:05:30,205 --> 01:05:33,205
Speaker 5:  that there were, there was a guy who was convicted of

1174
01:05:33,985 --> 01:05:37,845
Speaker 5:  for posting on Twitter about like telling people not to

1175
01:05:37,845 --> 01:05:41,805
Speaker 5:  vote, making fake ads saying you can vote by text message and telling

1176
01:05:41,805 --> 01:05:43,125
Speaker 5:  people not to vote. I

1177
01:05:43,125 --> 01:05:46,765
Speaker 6:  Think you were thinking of Jacob Wool the troll who

1178
01:05:46,905 --> 01:05:50,845
Speaker 6:  Yes. Was doing robocalls. Okay. And robocalls were, yeah,

1179
01:05:50,845 --> 01:05:54,485
Speaker 6:  they were an issue in the last election. They're obviously also just an issue

1180
01:05:54,545 --> 01:05:58,085
Speaker 6:  as part of the overwhelming span. That means I don't answer my phone anymore.

1181
01:05:58,145 --> 01:05:59,525
Speaker 6:  Yep. Same. And

1182
01:05:59,685 --> 01:06:02,045
Speaker 5:  I told somebody in an email the other day, oh, gimme a call when you get

1183
01:06:02,045 --> 01:06:05,245
Speaker 5:  a sec. And they called me four minutes later and I didn't answer. I was like,

1184
01:06:05,245 --> 01:06:06,565
Speaker 5:  I don't know this number. I'm not answering the

1185
01:06:06,565 --> 01:06:10,485
Speaker 6:  Phone. Anyway, so now AI has like, it has a lot of things supercharged

1186
01:06:10,485 --> 01:06:14,445
Speaker 6:  this, it's starting to become an issue and the FCC is at the very least

1187
01:06:14,725 --> 01:06:18,605
Speaker 6:  recognizing it's an issue. And we probably will end up seeing more about

1188
01:06:18,605 --> 01:06:18,765
Speaker 6:  this.

1189
01:06:19,515 --> 01:06:23,445
Speaker 5:  This also seems like we're already kind of deep in the deep fake

1190
01:06:23,885 --> 01:06:25,205
Speaker 5:  election in a very real way.

1191
01:06:25,405 --> 01:06:28,965
Speaker 3:  I just If you get a call and it's like, hello, this is President Biden.

1192
01:06:30,545 --> 01:06:31,765
Speaker 3:  Why would you ever believe that

1193
01:06:31,765 --> 01:06:33,205
Speaker 5:  Call call. I'd like Joe, what's up dude?

1194
01:06:33,515 --> 01:06:36,965
Speaker 3:  Like that like that's just like whenever you get the emails that is like,

1195
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:40,485
Speaker 3:  this is President Biden, I need your help right now. Alex Cranz.

1196
01:06:40,485 --> 01:06:44,285
Speaker 5:  But you would at least think that is a message he recorded,

1197
01:06:44,295 --> 01:06:45,805
Speaker 5:  right? It's like, no you wouldn't.

1198
01:06:46,115 --> 01:06:50,005
Speaker 3:  When you see those move on emails, are you like, oh my god, Nancy Pelosi

1199
01:06:50,105 --> 01:06:54,005
Speaker 3:  is actually emailing me. David Pierce? No. You're always like, this is stupid

1200
01:06:54,025 --> 01:06:54,565
Speaker 3:  and not real.

1201
01:06:54,835 --> 01:06:58,325
Speaker 6:  Okay. You want the weirdest version of this though? Is that Eric Adams,

1202
01:06:58,745 --> 01:07:01,685
Speaker 6:  who you will hear definitely in conjunction with the weirdest of anything.

1203
01:07:02,045 --> 01:07:05,845
Speaker 6:  Yeah. He does his own deep fakes. Like he had a bunch of

1204
01:07:05,845 --> 01:07:08,525
Speaker 6:  calls where he auto translated his voice. Yes,

1205
01:07:08,965 --> 01:07:09,285
Speaker 3:  I remember that.

1206
01:07:09,505 --> 01:07:13,245
Speaker 6:  To make it sound like he spoke languages that he didn't, I'm curious how

1207
01:07:13,245 --> 01:07:15,245
Speaker 6:  that stuff is going to end up being affected by this.

1208
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:19,765
Speaker 3:  I mean, hopefully, I would assume it'd be the same way where they're like,

1209
01:07:20,025 --> 01:07:20,805
Speaker 3:  no, that's not true.

1210
01:07:21,525 --> 01:07:25,285
Speaker 5:  I don't, oh man, what a legal mess that's gonna be. Can you deep fake

1211
01:07:25,565 --> 01:07:25,725
Speaker 5:  yourself?

1212
01:07:27,645 --> 01:07:30,125
Speaker 5:  I I don don don't know.

1213
01:07:30,365 --> 01:07:34,285
Speaker 3:  I feel like maybe just don't do that kind of call. Maybe, maybe just

1214
01:07:34,285 --> 01:07:38,045
Speaker 3:  don't like it's so, it's so pi like dumb because it's just like

1215
01:07:38,045 --> 01:07:41,845
Speaker 3:  Nancy Pelosi is not writing me this email. Joe Biden is not out here

1216
01:07:41,845 --> 01:07:45,685
Speaker 3:  calling me like at the phone, at the phone. Banks calling me because

1217
01:07:46,185 --> 01:07:49,685
Speaker 3:  do we do phone banks anymore? Is that really a thing anymore? No.

1218
01:07:50,455 --> 01:07:54,365
Speaker 3:  Maybe, maybe in New Hampshire, but it's just dumb.

1219
01:07:54,625 --> 01:07:58,485
Speaker 3:  I'm just like, who, who is answering these calls being like, oh wow, Joe

1220
01:07:58,485 --> 01:08:00,525
Speaker 3:  told me not to vote. Well, better not vote.

1221
01:08:01,325 --> 01:08:04,765
Speaker 5:  I mean, I I mean still people. The answer is forever Don't more people than

1222
01:08:04,765 --> 01:08:04,965
Speaker 5:  you think.

1223
01:08:05,075 --> 01:08:05,925
Speaker 3:  Yeah, but I'm

1224
01:08:05,925 --> 01:08:09,725
Speaker 5:  Just like, what? This stuff is, this stuff is a mess. And yeah, we are only

1225
01:08:09,725 --> 01:08:12,245
Speaker 5:  at the very beginning of what's to come Alex, what you got

1226
01:08:13,425 --> 01:08:16,765
Speaker 3:  My, my thing is not about Joe Biden or my, my home state or, okay, well then

1227
01:08:16,765 --> 01:08:20,205
Speaker 3:  don don't care. Yeah, nevermind. It's all dumb. No, it is cool because

1228
01:08:20,515 --> 01:08:23,685
Speaker 3:  Ford, Ford, hold on, let me see. I almost said Fort Worth again.

1229
01:08:24,315 --> 01:08:24,885
Speaker 5:  Ford Worth.

1230
01:08:25,155 --> 01:08:28,885
Speaker 3:  Ford Worth. Okay. So Ford has been quietly creating a

1231
01:08:28,925 --> 01:08:32,725
Speaker 3:  skunkworks team for low cost EVs. And that's exciting because

1232
01:08:32,915 --> 01:08:36,605
Speaker 3:  cheaper EVs are good. More competitors with Tesla

1233
01:08:36,795 --> 01:08:39,245
Speaker 3:  will be good. Just competition in general. We love that.

1234
01:08:40,745 --> 01:08:43,965
Speaker 3:  It is also, did you all watch that show like All American? I think it was

1235
01:08:43,965 --> 01:08:46,205
Speaker 3:  called like the auto show. Oh yeah.

1236
01:08:46,265 --> 01:08:47,405
Speaker 5:  On nbc, American Auto,

1237
01:08:47,925 --> 01:08:51,285
Speaker 3:  American Auto. Yeah. Yeah. It just feels like it was out of a, a storyline

1238
01:08:51,285 --> 01:08:51,845
Speaker 3:  from that.

1239
01:08:52,185 --> 01:08:55,445
Speaker 5:  So, okay, lemme explain to you what I don't understand about this. Ford

1240
01:08:56,755 --> 01:09:00,525
Speaker 5:  notoriously a company that makes cars. Yeah. You don't

1241
01:09:00,525 --> 01:09:04,245
Speaker 5:  need to make a car company inside of your car company to make cars,

1242
01:09:04,505 --> 01:09:08,405
Speaker 5:  but you can just make cars. Yeah. That's your, that's your thing. It's like

1243
01:09:08,405 --> 01:09:11,725
Speaker 5:  Apple's like, well we created a skunkworks team inside of Apple to build

1244
01:09:11,755 --> 01:09:15,005
Speaker 5:  smartphones. It's like, nope. You do that already. Just tell them to make

1245
01:09:15,045 --> 01:09:18,085
Speaker 5:  a different one. Yeah. What is the, I this what Yeah,

1246
01:09:18,765 --> 01:09:20,165
Speaker 3:  I think my, my understanding of it is

1247
01:09:20,165 --> 01:09:23,245
Speaker 5:  Ford is like, it's illegal for Ford to make anything other than F1 fifties.

1248
01:09:23,585 --> 01:09:26,245
Speaker 5:  So they have to create a whole new thing to make something else. I

1249
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:29,885
Speaker 3:  Suspect it was probably because a lot of the people working on the Skunkworks

1250
01:09:29,885 --> 01:09:33,725
Speaker 3:  project, the, the head of it is, is a guy who was at Tesla for

1251
01:09:33,725 --> 01:09:37,365
Speaker 3:  years, Alan Clark. But a lot of the people working on it are from this place

1252
01:09:37,365 --> 01:09:40,765
Speaker 3:  called Automotive Auto Space

1253
01:09:40,945 --> 01:09:44,845
Speaker 3:  Motive, space Power. I had to ah, A MP.

1254
01:09:44,915 --> 01:09:48,725
Speaker 3:  Sure. Yeah. I had to, I had to spell it out And, and they

1255
01:09:48,965 --> 01:09:52,045
Speaker 3:  acquired this startup last year and So I think it's probably just easier

1256
01:09:52,225 --> 01:09:56,005
Speaker 3:  to hold them into a little company than a big company. But still, I, I agree

1257
01:09:56,005 --> 01:09:59,805
Speaker 3:  with you. It's like you can just go tell your people to make cheap EVs. Like

1258
01:09:59,995 --> 01:10:02,845
Speaker 5:  That just makes me think they call it a skunkworks. 'cause somebody at Ford

1259
01:10:02,845 --> 01:10:05,765
Speaker 5:  thinks that makes them sound like a tech company, but Sounds cool. And what

1260
01:10:05,765 --> 01:10:09,125
Speaker 5:  that actually is, is just a team at your company that's, that's just some

1261
01:10:09,125 --> 01:10:09,925
Speaker 5:  people who work for you.

1262
01:10:09,925 --> 01:10:12,885
Speaker 3:  They're, they're gonna go make a really cool stealth bomber. That's

1263
01:10:13,235 --> 01:10:16,805
Speaker 5:  Ford. I think it's awesome. I am extremely in favor of Ford and everybody

1264
01:10:16,805 --> 01:10:20,605
Speaker 5:  else trying to figure out how to make cheap EVs because that dream seems

1265
01:10:20,605 --> 01:10:23,925
Speaker 5:  increasingly dead all over the place now. And

1266
01:10:24,955 --> 01:10:28,325
Speaker 5:  like more power to anybody trying to pull this off.

1267
01:10:28,475 --> 01:10:32,405
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It's, it's funny, like Farley, the, the CEO of Ford

1268
01:10:32,585 --> 01:10:36,325
Speaker 3:  had an earnings call after all of this came out. TechCrunch reported the

1269
01:10:36,325 --> 01:10:39,925
Speaker 3:  story and said the, the Clark and, and the team at ammp

1270
01:10:40,015 --> 01:10:43,885
Speaker 3:  slash ford, skunkworks cheap evs.com,

1271
01:10:44,165 --> 01:10:47,765
Speaker 3:  whatever you wanna call the place, said this is a flexible platform that

1272
01:10:47,765 --> 01:10:51,725
Speaker 3:  will not only deploy to several types of vehicles, but will be, but will

1273
01:10:51,725 --> 01:10:55,205
Speaker 3:  be a large installed base for software and services that we're now seeing

1274
01:10:55,265 --> 01:10:58,845
Speaker 3:  at Ford Pro. I don't know what any of that

1275
01:10:58,935 --> 01:11:02,165
Speaker 3:  means. And I, I don't understand how this company is running

1276
01:11:02,985 --> 01:11:04,445
Speaker 3:  and doesn't know that it's a car company.

1277
01:11:04,845 --> 01:11:08,685
Speaker 5:  Somebody went to chat GPT and said, listen Dear chat GPTI run

1278
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:09,285
Speaker 5:  a car company

1279
01:11:09,915 --> 01:11:10,765
Speaker 3:  Like Jim Farley.

1280
01:11:10,765 --> 01:11:14,645
Speaker 5:  What would I say if I ran a tech company instead? And they wrote that press

1281
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:14,965
Speaker 5:  release.

1282
01:11:15,075 --> 01:11:19,005
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Jim Farley. Don't, don't let Chad GPT write your press releases anymore.

1283
01:11:19,005 --> 01:11:20,165
Speaker 5:  Just build cars, man. Just,

1284
01:11:20,165 --> 01:11:20,925
Speaker 3:  Just make cool cars.

1285
01:11:20,925 --> 01:11:24,325
Speaker 5:  Just make cheaper cars. Yeah. Take the things that you make and make them

1286
01:11:24,325 --> 01:11:25,325
Speaker 5:  cheaper maybe

1287
01:11:25,335 --> 01:11:26,565
Speaker 3:  Maybe shorter, right.

1288
01:11:26,565 --> 01:11:27,485
Speaker 5:  Inside your company. Yeah.

1289
01:11:27,485 --> 01:11:30,405
Speaker 3:  Maybe I don't need cameras to be able to see out of the front of my car.

1290
01:11:31,145 --> 01:11:33,165
Speaker 5:  Listen, it's, we can all dream little

1291
01:11:33,165 --> 01:11:33,285
Speaker 3:  Things.

1292
01:11:33,285 --> 01:11:37,245
Speaker 5:  Total things. I'm gonna go last because we started on a

1293
01:11:37,295 --> 01:11:39,645
Speaker 5:  Cranz victory lap and now we're gonna take a David Victory lap. Yeah. What,

1294
01:11:39,645 --> 01:11:39,845
Speaker 5:  what

1295
01:11:39,845 --> 01:11:40,045
Speaker 3:  Is it?

1296
01:11:40,625 --> 01:11:44,445
Speaker 5:  So the, the information reported this week that Apple is developing,

1297
01:11:44,495 --> 01:11:48,165
Speaker 5:  quote, at least two iPhone prototypes that are

1298
01:11:48,395 --> 01:11:48,965
Speaker 5:  flip phones

1299
01:11:49,345 --> 01:11:53,285
Speaker 3:  In their skunkworks project that's probably not actually owned

1300
01:11:53,285 --> 01:11:53,565
Speaker 3:  by Apple.

1301
01:11:53,565 --> 01:11:57,445
Speaker 5:  Correct. Which is just they, they take all the people who

1302
01:11:57,445 --> 01:12:00,765
Speaker 5:  work at Apple Park and they just tell them to make phones

1303
01:12:02,385 --> 01:12:05,205
Speaker 5:  and they say You're a skunkworks now. And somebody raises their hand and

1304
01:12:05,205 --> 01:12:08,365
Speaker 5:  says, what does that mean? Does it change anything? And they say, shut up.

1305
01:12:08,805 --> 01:12:11,805
Speaker 5:  We're a tech company. This is The future. Just

1306
01:12:11,805 --> 01:12:12,245
Speaker 3:  Go do it.

1307
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:16,325
Speaker 5:  But there have been rumors about this for a while that Apple was making these

1308
01:12:16,325 --> 01:12:20,285
Speaker 5:  things. And also a thing to know about a company like Apple is

1309
01:12:20,285 --> 01:12:24,005
Speaker 5:  that they prototype everything like If. you can imagine a phone of

1310
01:12:24,355 --> 01:12:27,765
Speaker 5:  some shape or function or feature.

1311
01:12:28,365 --> 01:12:32,205
Speaker 5:  I, I would bet you $10 there is one on a table somewhere

1312
01:12:32,705 --> 01:12:35,805
Speaker 5:  in Apple Park. It's just how it works. It's just what you do. If, you are

1313
01:12:35,845 --> 01:12:39,525
Speaker 5:  a company this big that makes this many products, but Apple like me

1314
01:12:40,465 --> 01:12:44,365
Speaker 5:  thinks flip phones kick ass and is gonna make some And I think it's awesome.

1315
01:12:44,725 --> 01:12:48,485
Speaker 5:  I love that. And apparently also Apple is working on a foldable iPad,

1316
01:12:48,495 --> 01:12:52,045
Speaker 5:  which is the other dream. Yeah. Like what a, that's just like give me an

1317
01:12:52,045 --> 01:12:54,965
Speaker 5:  iPad mini that folds up and I can put it in my pocket. Like hell Yeah. That

1318
01:12:54,965 --> 01:12:58,885
Speaker 5:  is also apparently being worked on this stuff is complicated. We've seen

1319
01:12:58,915 --> 01:13:02,805
Speaker 5:  flip phones, they're hard and bad and have big creases and have

1320
01:13:02,805 --> 01:13:03,165
Speaker 5:  their issues.

1321
01:13:04,765 --> 01:13:08,645
Speaker 5:  I still firmly believe this is like the next thing. Yes. And

1322
01:13:08,805 --> 01:13:12,525
Speaker 5:  I think it's clearer to everyone, including Apple, that smartphones

1323
01:13:12,525 --> 01:13:16,445
Speaker 5:  need a next thing or they're just gonna be laptops. They're just gonna

1324
01:13:16,445 --> 01:13:19,285
Speaker 5:  be fine. You're gonna have it, you're never gonna think about it. You're

1325
01:13:19,285 --> 01:13:22,325
Speaker 5:  gonna upgrade it when it dies and that's gonna be it. And Apple has a lot

1326
01:13:22,325 --> 01:13:25,805
Speaker 5:  of money riding on being able to get you to upgrade more quickly than that.

1327
01:13:26,225 --> 01:13:29,285
Speaker 5:  And I think Foldables are gonna be that thing.

1328
01:13:29,845 --> 01:13:33,725
Speaker 3:  I think the only part of this that surprises me is that we

1329
01:13:33,725 --> 01:13:37,565
Speaker 3:  aren't closer to the Apple foldable given historically

1330
01:13:37,565 --> 01:13:41,205
Speaker 3:  their timeline of kind of like following everybody else. Yeah. They're usually

1331
01:13:41,205 --> 01:13:44,165
Speaker 3:  only a couple of years with, with the exception of The, Vision, Pro, they're

1332
01:13:44,165 --> 01:13:47,285
Speaker 3:  usually only a couple years behind everybody else. This and this one would

1333
01:13:47,285 --> 01:13:47,405
Speaker 3:  be like

1334
01:13:47,475 --> 01:13:50,405
Speaker 5:  Five or six years. Do you know my theory about this? What they can't call

1335
01:13:50,405 --> 01:13:53,765
Speaker 5:  it anything other than the iPhone and you can't make an iPhone

1336
01:13:54,835 --> 01:13:58,565
Speaker 5:  that is like a 1.0 anymore. Mm. Like they, they

1337
01:13:58,615 --> 01:14:02,605
Speaker 5:  can't come out and be like, it's a new thing. It's called the I flip

1338
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:05,765
Speaker 5:  everybody like no, it's just a flip. It's this iPhone. Yeah. Like what are

1339
01:14:05,765 --> 01:14:09,485
Speaker 5:  we doing here? And So I think if I'm Apple, I feel like I have to make an

1340
01:14:09,485 --> 01:14:13,245
Speaker 5:  iPhone that is like on par with all the iPhones we already sell,

1341
01:14:13,455 --> 01:14:17,325
Speaker 5:  which is now a 17-year-old line of phones. Same.

1342
01:14:17,425 --> 01:14:20,965
Speaker 5:  And So I. Think catching up to that is really hard because the flip phones

1343
01:14:21,035 --> 01:14:24,685
Speaker 5:  require new components. They require rethinking how batteries work.

1344
01:14:24,685 --> 01:14:27,285
Speaker 5:  There's some new software stuff they're gonna have to do. Like it's hard

1345
01:14:27,285 --> 01:14:31,165
Speaker 5:  work to do this well. And I think in the way that Apple was

1346
01:14:31,165 --> 01:14:34,365
Speaker 5:  clearly very comfortable releasing a Vision Pro that is not the thing they

1347
01:14:34,365 --> 01:14:38,045
Speaker 5:  wanted it to be. I don't think you get away with that. Okay.

1348
01:14:38,075 --> 01:14:41,445
Speaker 5:  With an iPhone. I think you can maybe get away with that with an iPad. I

1349
01:14:41,445 --> 01:14:44,765
Speaker 5:  think if they came out with a foldable iPad and were like, this is a whole

1350
01:14:44,765 --> 01:14:47,125
Speaker 5:  new thing. And people were like, it's not perfect, but oh my God, it folds

1351
01:14:47,125 --> 01:14:51,045
Speaker 5:  isn Isn't that cool? That I could see. But I think the

1352
01:14:51,045 --> 01:14:55,005
Speaker 5:  iPhone is too big and too important to everything that Apple is

1353
01:14:55,005 --> 01:14:58,485
Speaker 5:  doing for them to be like, here's a thing that's not quite finished. Okay.

1354
01:14:58,565 --> 01:14:59,885
Speaker 5:  I, that's my theory. I guess

1355
01:14:59,885 --> 01:15:02,925
Speaker 6:  I can see that the iPhone is also just your phone is a thing that you absolutely

1356
01:15:02,925 --> 01:15:06,565
Speaker 6:  need to work in a way that you don't a bunch of other devices. Right?

1357
01:15:06,565 --> 01:15:10,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah. If if like if my iPad sucks, I just put it down. But like

1358
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:14,925
Speaker 5:  I if Yeah. No, you're exactly right. If I leave my phone at home, life

1359
01:15:14,925 --> 01:15:18,445
Speaker 5:  has fallen apart. I had, when I was at, when I was in Vegas

1360
01:15:18,705 --> 01:15:22,645
Speaker 5:  for CES, I, my phone just like broke. Yeah. One day. And it was the

1361
01:15:22,645 --> 01:15:26,485
Speaker 5:  most stressful, like six hours trying to get all of that to work again. 'cause

1362
01:15:26,485 --> 01:15:28,765
Speaker 5:  I couldn't log into anything. 'cause I didn't have the two-factor working.

1363
01:15:29,405 --> 01:15:32,845
Speaker 5:  I couldn't talk to my wife because we talk over SMS because she's on the

1364
01:15:32,845 --> 01:15:36,805
Speaker 5:  Pixel and I'm on an iPhone. Like it was awful. And I had this moment of

1365
01:15:36,805 --> 01:15:39,725
Speaker 5:  being like, oh, I'm way too reliant on my phone. But that's just life now.

1366
01:15:39,725 --> 01:15:40,965
Speaker 5:  You're exactly right. You can actually

1367
01:15:41,035 --> 01:15:44,845
Speaker 3:  Feel your stress. Like I only sort of tangentially knew about

1368
01:15:45,035 --> 01:15:47,965
Speaker 3:  what was happening with your phone, but I could still feel the stress through

1369
01:15:47,965 --> 01:15:48,725
Speaker 3:  Vegas. Oh

1370
01:15:48,725 --> 01:15:52,405
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Oh yeah. I about burned our hotel down with my anxiety

1371
01:15:52,425 --> 01:15:54,965
Speaker 3:  Trying to Yeah. Like the moment. And you could also at what, at one point

1372
01:15:54,965 --> 01:15:58,085
Speaker 3:  you're like, oh, I'm feeling pretty good. David must have gotten his phone

1373
01:15:58,085 --> 01:16:00,365
Speaker 3:  fixed. Okay, we're

1374
01:16:00,365 --> 01:16:02,805
Speaker 5:  Good. Yeah. I had this moment of like, okay, I have meetings to go to. I

1375
01:16:02,805 --> 01:16:05,365
Speaker 5:  have things I'm supposed to do today. I'm not doing any of it because my

1376
01:16:05,365 --> 01:16:08,605
Speaker 5:  phone doesn't work. Yeah. It's like, what is this world that I live in now?

1377
01:16:08,985 --> 01:16:12,165
Speaker 5:  But that, like, I can't, I cannot leave my hotel room until my phone works

1378
01:16:12,175 --> 01:16:15,525
Speaker 5:  again. Yeah. It's not good. It's not good. But, but you're totally right.

1379
01:16:15,525 --> 01:16:18,925
Speaker 5:  Like that, that is, that is where Apple is. And so if they're like, here's

1380
01:16:18,925 --> 01:16:21,125
Speaker 5:  the iPhone flip, it might break,

1381
01:16:21,745 --> 01:16:24,485
Speaker 3:  But gimme the iPad, gimme the, I like, that's what I'm saying. I got my little

1382
01:16:24,485 --> 01:16:27,765
Speaker 3:  iPad mini. I wanna get rid of that thing. I want, I want it to fold. I wanna

1383
01:16:27,765 --> 01:16:28,525
Speaker 3:  have it in my back pocket.

1384
01:16:28,745 --> 01:16:32,565
Speaker 5:  I'm ready. I've been waiting so long to upgrade my iPad Mini, which still

1385
01:16:32,565 --> 01:16:36,085
Speaker 5:  has touch id and is like busted and is now old enough that some of the apps

1386
01:16:36,085 --> 01:16:39,885
Speaker 5:  won't update, update anymore. And I'm just holding out. I'm like, give me,

1387
01:16:39,885 --> 01:16:41,805
Speaker 5:  give me the thing Apple, give it to me.

1388
01:16:41,825 --> 01:16:45,485
Speaker 3:  You're gonna have to wait till it's sounds like 2026 is the

1389
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:48,565
Speaker 3:  earliest people are are theorizing. This is gonna come out, but we'll see.

1390
01:16:49,045 --> 01:16:50,165
Speaker 5:  I can't wait that long. Yeah.

1391
01:16:50,405 --> 01:16:53,925
Speaker 3:  I mean we, we've got new iPads coming probably pretty soon. I'm just

1392
01:16:53,925 --> 01:16:57,125
Speaker 5:  Gonna listen. Tim Cook. I know you're listening. You're you, you're in a

1393
01:16:57,125 --> 01:17:01,045
Speaker 5:  room with Bob. I hear right now listening to this podcast. Just ship

1394
01:17:01,045 --> 01:17:04,125
Speaker 5:  me one. I won't even tell anybody. Just get me one. It'll be fine. Everything

1395
01:17:04,125 --> 01:17:08,085
Speaker 5:  will be okay. All right. We gotta get outta here. We've, we've

1396
01:17:08,085 --> 01:17:11,645
Speaker 5:  gone long as always. Yep. In Eli's honor.

1397
01:17:11,795 --> 01:17:14,405
Speaker 5:  That sounds like Eli's dead. Eli's just gone for the day. He'll be back.

1398
01:17:14,765 --> 01:17:17,205
Speaker 5:  Everybody always gets very worried about NELI when he's not here. I promise

1399
01:17:17,485 --> 01:17:21,325
Speaker 5:  everyone he's okay. He's just, I think on a plane being too ashamed of

1400
01:17:21,325 --> 01:17:24,205
Speaker 5:  himself to use his Vision Pro. Yeah. Which I plan to give him a lot of crap

1401
01:17:24,205 --> 01:17:27,685
Speaker 5:  for next week. But we need to get outta here. But before we do one quick
