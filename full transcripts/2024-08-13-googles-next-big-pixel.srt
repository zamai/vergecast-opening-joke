Description: Today on the flagship podcast of the correct height-to-width ratio of a foldable phone: 
The Verge’s David Pierce, Allison Johnson, Victoria Song, and Chris Welch discuss all the new gadget announcements from Google’s Pixel event — including the Pixel 9, the Pixel Watch 3, the Pixel buds, and more.

2
00:00:02,395 --> 00:00:05,765
Speaker 1:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of the correct

3
00:00:06,025 --> 00:00:09,925
Speaker 1:  height to width ratio of a foldable phone. I'm your friend David Pierce

4
00:00:10,265 --> 00:00:14,005
Speaker 1:  and I'm back. I was on vacation for the last two weeks up in New

5
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:17,885
Speaker 1:  England, looking at leaves and froing in fields and

6
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:22,085
Speaker 1:  drinking fancy coffee and doing all the things that you normally do on vacation.

7
00:00:22,525 --> 00:00:26,325
Speaker 1:  I missed a shocking amount of news for like late July and

8
00:00:26,325 --> 00:00:30,165
Speaker 1:  early August. Truly bonkers how much stuff is going on, but now

9
00:00:30,185 --> 00:00:33,005
Speaker 1:  I'm back. The team did an awesome job while I was out. Thank you to everybody

10
00:00:33,005 --> 00:00:35,645
Speaker 1:  who sent us feedback on the pilots we've been doing. We have lots more fun

11
00:00:35,645 --> 00:00:39,565
Speaker 1:  stuff coming up on that front, but it's gadgets and friends. So we have a

12
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:43,405
Speaker 1:  lot to do today on the show. We are going to talk all pixel all the time.

13
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:46,405
Speaker 1:  The reason this episode is coming out a little bit late is because Google

14
00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:50,045
Speaker 1:  is having an event today, potentially right now as you're listening to this,

15
00:00:50,255 --> 00:00:53,805
Speaker 1:  announcing all of its hardware for the year. We've gotten some of the hardware

16
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:57,765
Speaker 1:  already, the New Nest thermostat, the new TV streamer, but all

17
00:00:57,765 --> 00:01:01,045
Speaker 1:  the phones, all the, everything that's been leaked and talked about for months,

18
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,205
Speaker 1:  it's all coming out right now. A couple of folks on our team have seen this

19
00:01:04,205 --> 00:01:06,845
Speaker 1:  stuff. They've been briefed on the news. They know what's coming. So we are

20
00:01:06,845 --> 00:01:10,005
Speaker 1:  gonna talk about all the new stuff coming from Google and what it means.

21
00:01:10,245 --> 00:01:13,645
Speaker 1:  I really can't figure out Google as a hardware company. I've spent a long

22
00:01:13,645 --> 00:01:17,405
Speaker 1:  time trying to figure it out and we're gonna try and do it all at once on

23
00:01:17,405 --> 00:01:21,365
Speaker 1:  this episode. So that's what this episode is. It's all Google all the time.

24
00:01:21,475 --> 00:01:25,405
Speaker 1:  It's The Pixel special. We're gonna get into it, but first I just have

25
00:01:25,465 --> 00:01:28,805
Speaker 1:  one quick PSA for you. And I learned this again. I've learned this a hundred

26
00:01:28,805 --> 00:01:32,765
Speaker 1:  times and I keep forgetting every time I go on vacation. The buffer day

27
00:01:33,185 --> 00:01:37,045
Speaker 1:  is everything. When you get home from a trip, make sure there is one whole

28
00:01:37,065 --> 00:01:40,685
Speaker 1:  day between the end of that trip and whatever thing you have to do next,

29
00:01:40,755 --> 00:01:44,325
Speaker 1:  back to school, back to work, whatever it is you're doing. Come home on Saturday

30
00:01:44,435 --> 00:01:47,645
Speaker 1:  instead of going on Sunday and night and then going back to work Monday morning.

31
00:01:47,865 --> 00:01:51,765
Speaker 1:  That's awful. Didn't do the buffer day. Regret the buffer day. All

32
00:01:51,765 --> 00:01:55,205
Speaker 1:  hail the buffer day. Let's talk Pixel. This is The Vergecast. We'll be right

33
00:01:55,205 --> 00:01:55,365
Speaker 1:  back.

34
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,035
Speaker 1:  very, very few of you

35
00:03:53,095 --> 00:03:57,075
Speaker 1:  and I have a list of gadgets that I wanna talk

36
00:03:57,075 --> 00:04:00,355
Speaker 1:  about. And first what's gonna happen is I'm gonna give you the list and then

37
00:04:00,355 --> 00:04:03,075
Speaker 1:  you're gonna tell me if there's anything that I'm missing that are surprises

38
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:05,395
Speaker 1:  because I'm coming back from two weeks of vacation and I missed a lot of

39
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:09,355
Speaker 1:  things and then I have ranked the things in the order in which I am

40
00:04:09,355 --> 00:04:11,675
Speaker 1:  interested in them and then we're gonna talk about them. That'll sound good.

41
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:12,235
Speaker 1:  Great.

42
00:04:12,615 --> 00:04:12,835
Speaker 6:  So

43
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:16,715
Speaker 1:  Here's my whole list. I have The, Pixel nine, The, Pixel nine

44
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:20,155
Speaker 1:  Pro, the other Pixel nine Pro and The Pixel nine fold. Are those all the

45
00:04:20,155 --> 00:04:21,715
Speaker 1:  phones? Did I miss any phones? Those

46
00:04:21,715 --> 00:04:22,195
Speaker 6:  Are the phones.

47
00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:25,475
Speaker 1:  Okay. I have a Pixel Watch two and Pixel Buds.

48
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:27,555
Speaker 5:  Pixel Watch three. Oh

49
00:04:27,555 --> 00:04:29,395
Speaker 1:  God. David is it the Pixel Watch three already? It

50
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:30,755
Speaker 5:  Is the Pixel Watch three already.

51
00:04:31,345 --> 00:04:34,475
Speaker 1:  Okay, alright. Oh and there's two of them. So we have the Pixel Watch three

52
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:38,315
Speaker 1:  and the other Pixel Watch three. Yes. And the Pixel buds with a number attached

53
00:04:38,315 --> 00:04:41,355
Speaker 1:  that I can't be bothered to worry about right now. We also have the Google

54
00:04:41,495 --> 00:04:45,475
Speaker 1:  TV streamer, nay Chromecast, RIP, which I wanna

55
00:04:45,475 --> 00:04:48,675
Speaker 1:  talk about. Those are all the gadgets, but I also have, I haven't Nest thermostat

56
00:04:48,675 --> 00:04:50,955
Speaker 1:  I guess. We'll, we'll touch on that, but we're gonna get to that with Jen

57
00:04:51,045 --> 00:04:54,315
Speaker 1:  later this summer I think. And I have The Pixel screenshots thing, a bunch

58
00:04:54,315 --> 00:04:57,675
Speaker 1:  of AI and just some other random nonsense to get to. Am I missing anything

59
00:04:57,675 --> 00:04:59,275
Speaker 1:  before we dive in? I don't think so.

60
00:04:59,515 --> 00:04:59,995
Speaker 6:  I think you got it

61
00:05:00,355 --> 00:05:02,555
Speaker 5:  Probably, but we'll get to it. We'll get get to it

62
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,475
Speaker 1:  Probably. Yeah, this is Google, like there's probably several gadgets that

63
00:05:05,475 --> 00:05:09,155
Speaker 1:  the leak between now and the event on Tuesday when folks are hearing this.

64
00:05:09,395 --> 00:05:13,315
Speaker 1:  So for anything we missed, I apologize. Blame Sue Hai. Let's start with the

65
00:05:13,315 --> 00:05:16,635
Speaker 1:  funds, because I feel like this is, this is just where we have to start

66
00:05:16,965 --> 00:05:19,955
Speaker 1:  again, this, this is all new. I don't know any of the specs of these things.

67
00:05:19,955 --> 00:05:22,835
Speaker 1:  So the first thing you, you're all gonna have to do is kind of give me the

68
00:05:22,835 --> 00:05:25,395
Speaker 1:  rundown of what's going on and then we're gonna, we're gonna talk about our

69
00:05:25,395 --> 00:05:29,075
Speaker 1:  feelings about all of it. So let's, let's start with The. Pixel nine.

70
00:05:29,145 --> 00:05:30,795
Speaker 1:  Allison, tell me about The. Pixel nine.

71
00:05:31,145 --> 00:05:34,715
Speaker 6:  Yeah, pixel nine. So we used to have two phones. Wow.

72
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:39,155
Speaker 6:  Two phones that didn't fold. Now there's three phones that don't fold in

73
00:05:39,155 --> 00:05:42,995
Speaker 6:  half. So Pixel nine is still the, the entry level is

74
00:05:43,235 --> 00:05:47,195
Speaker 6:  a hundred dollars more expensive this year, which seems to keep happening

75
00:05:47,495 --> 00:05:48,635
Speaker 6:  to this phone.

76
00:05:48,905 --> 00:05:52,035
Speaker 1:  Yeah, remember when The Pixel was like the cheap flagship that was like its

77
00:05:52,035 --> 00:05:52,915
Speaker 1:  whole thing that is long

78
00:05:52,915 --> 00:05:56,635
Speaker 6:  Gone. I looked at it The Pixel six was 5 99 and we are

79
00:05:56,985 --> 00:06:00,845
Speaker 6:  $200 farther away from that. So this year

80
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:04,765
Speaker 6:  it's got 6.3 inch screen, which is like, they keep

81
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:08,165
Speaker 6:  making it a tiny bit bigger without making the phone like

82
00:06:08,965 --> 00:06:12,365
Speaker 6:  meaningfully bigger. So it's still like this small phone

83
00:06:12,745 --> 00:06:16,485
Speaker 6:  of the pixels like due without what you want, but

84
00:06:16,515 --> 00:06:20,325
Speaker 6:  there's more ram this year upgraded ultra wide

85
00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:24,005
Speaker 6:  camera, little bit bigger battery, that kind of thing,

86
00:06:24,035 --> 00:06:27,605
Speaker 6:  like incremental stuff. And then there's all the ai,

87
00:06:27,905 --> 00:06:28,245
Speaker 6:  you know,

88
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,325
Speaker 1:  There's a new chip, right? That's, that's like, yeah, I would assume for

89
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:34,165
Speaker 1:  all the AI stuff they're trying to do that ends up being like the big spec

90
00:06:34,165 --> 00:06:35,445
Speaker 1:  bump here would be the new chip

91
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:38,965
Speaker 6:  Tensor G four and that's a across the board in all of them.

92
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:42,845
Speaker 1:  That is one thing Google does that I really like is have the same chip in

93
00:06:42,845 --> 00:06:46,045
Speaker 1:  everything and they claim it's an AI thing and that sort of makes sense.

94
00:06:46,265 --> 00:06:50,165
Speaker 1:  But at least your phone should perform very well no matter which one

95
00:06:50,165 --> 00:06:53,925
Speaker 1:  you buy is a is a nice and not always common thing to have

96
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:54,365
Speaker 1:  going on.

97
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:55,805
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Good job Google.

98
00:06:56,465 --> 00:06:59,565
Speaker 1:  Not a lot of enthusiasm coming from you on The. Pixel nine. I gotta say like,

99
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,925
Speaker 1:  I'm just, it's just, it's those not brimming with excitement.

100
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:07,445
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's, it's the boring one this year. Okay. I think mostly because there's

101
00:07:07,505 --> 00:07:11,325
Speaker 6:  now a pro version like pro phone

102
00:07:11,325 --> 00:07:15,205
Speaker 6:  that's basically the same size. And I get excited about this size phone.

103
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:19,365
Speaker 6:  So I wanna see The Pixel nine Pro. Unfortunately it is

104
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:23,405
Speaker 6:  shipping much later than the other ones. So it's gonna

105
00:07:23,405 --> 00:07:26,885
Speaker 6:  be TVD on like opinions about that one. The

106
00:07:26,885 --> 00:07:30,565
Speaker 5:  Colors are nice this year on the, on the small phone. The,

107
00:07:30,705 --> 00:07:31,565
Speaker 5:  the boring phone.

108
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,805
Speaker 1:  Are they, what are the colors?

109
00:07:33,145 --> 00:07:36,765
Speaker 5:  You know, there's always the two boring colors and then there's this winter

110
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:40,605
Speaker 5:  green, yeah. Peony. So it's very like pink and

111
00:07:40,605 --> 00:07:44,445
Speaker 5:  green. It's, it's a vibe. It's a very happy pink.

112
00:07:44,475 --> 00:07:47,845
Speaker 5:  It's, it's pink. It's not like here's a drop of pink.

113
00:07:48,355 --> 00:07:49,845
Speaker 5:  It's basically white. They

114
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:50,405
Speaker 6:  Went for it.

115
00:07:50,515 --> 00:07:53,245
Speaker 5:  They went for it. They, they were just like colors. We love them.

116
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:56,725
Speaker 1:  I actually appreciate that from Google. I feel like everyone else is out

117
00:07:56,725 --> 00:07:59,965
Speaker 1:  here trying to like come up with fancy names for beige on their phones

118
00:08:00,535 --> 00:08:04,445
Speaker 1:  every year. And Google at least is, is committed to the bit of, do

119
00:08:04,445 --> 00:08:08,045
Speaker 1:  you want this green phone? Yeah. And I do want the screen phone.

120
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:12,205
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Like I I do Google. Yes. Thank you. Alright, so le let's talk about

121
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:15,965
Speaker 1:  the, the pro because the, my guess would be that

122
00:08:16,025 --> 00:08:19,965
Speaker 1:  the pro is going to be vastly more interesting to most people than the

123
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:23,645
Speaker 1:  regular Pixel nine. Especially because The Pixel nine is not so

124
00:08:23,735 --> 00:08:27,605
Speaker 1:  cheap anymore as to be kind of a tiebreaker for money reasons

125
00:08:27,705 --> 00:08:31,445
Speaker 1:  for most people. So what, and and like you said, You can now get a Pixel

126
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:35,165
Speaker 1:  nine Pro at the same size as The Pixel nine, which I think is also a big

127
00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:37,245
Speaker 1:  deal. So what's, what's the story of the pro here?

128
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:41,645
Speaker 6:  Yeah, the Pro. So all three other phones are

129
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:45,485
Speaker 6:  pro something. There's the Nine Pro, that's the smaller one

130
00:08:46,035 --> 00:08:49,885
Speaker 6:  nine Pro xl, which is a 6.8 inch grain, which

131
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:53,525
Speaker 6:  is up in, you know, Samsung Galaxy S 24 Ultra

132
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:57,605
Speaker 6:  Territory. It's like a big one. And then the, the Fold The Pixel

133
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:01,725
Speaker 6:  nine Pro Fold is a pro phone this year. And

134
00:09:01,725 --> 00:09:05,565
Speaker 6:  as best I can tell, I made a spreadsheet of the Specs Pro

135
00:09:05,615 --> 00:09:09,405
Speaker 6:  means it has 16 gigs of Ram. That's the only like

136
00:09:09,595 --> 00:09:13,565
Speaker 6:  through line on the pro phones. Okay. So like you said, they all

137
00:09:13,565 --> 00:09:17,365
Speaker 6:  have 10 zero G four, you have two choices of pro

138
00:09:17,365 --> 00:09:21,165
Speaker 6:  phones that don't fold in half super big screen or

139
00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:25,365
Speaker 6:  reasonably sized screen. The nine Pro is

140
00:09:25,395 --> 00:09:28,965
Speaker 6:  9 99. So that's, no it's not a price increase

141
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:33,205
Speaker 6:  even though the phone is small. It's weird comparing the eight Pro to the

142
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:36,645
Speaker 6:  Nine Pro. 'cause it's, you really wanna compare the eight Pro to the Nine

143
00:09:36,645 --> 00:09:39,925
Speaker 6:  Pro xl. It's real wonky. Yeah.

144
00:09:39,925 --> 00:09:42,685
Speaker 1:  Chris, Chris, can you make sense of this lineup for me? Because you're, you're

145
00:09:42,685 --> 00:09:46,485
Speaker 1:  the person I trust to want the most phone at all times possible and I

146
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:48,965
Speaker 1:  I, I appreciate that about you. What do you make of this lineup?

147
00:09:49,705 --> 00:09:53,405
Speaker 7:  It feels pretty conventional. Like once you like, just look at the nine and

148
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:57,605
Speaker 7:  nine Pro xl which are gonna come out first. So that's kinda like just the

149
00:09:57,605 --> 00:10:00,805
Speaker 7:  usual playbook for Google. And then Nine Pro will be out sometime next month

150
00:10:00,805 --> 00:10:04,725
Speaker 7:  they say. But yeah, I mean I want the fold obviously for no reason other

151
00:10:04,725 --> 00:10:05,165
Speaker 7:  than it's very

152
00:10:05,445 --> 00:10:05,605
Speaker 1:  Previous

153
00:10:06,825 --> 00:10:10,285
Speaker 7:  And they got the screen size right and yeah, there's a lot to like about

154
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:10,685
Speaker 7:  it this year.

155
00:10:11,055 --> 00:10:13,845
Speaker 1:  Let's just get into that because I feel like I wanted to start with The Pixel

156
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:17,405
Speaker 1:  phones because I feel like a, they are the ones that most people who want

157
00:10:17,405 --> 00:10:21,285
Speaker 1:  these phones will buy, but also they are what they are, right? Like we're,

158
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:23,365
Speaker 1:  we're in a phase with all of these phones, no matter what company you buy

159
00:10:23,365 --> 00:10:25,965
Speaker 1:  from, where You can pretty much write down a list of what's going to happen

160
00:10:25,965 --> 00:10:29,445
Speaker 1:  next year. And you're almost always right. So let's move on from that because

161
00:10:29,485 --> 00:10:33,445
Speaker 1:  I, I agree it seems like the fold is probably the most different

162
00:10:33,585 --> 00:10:37,525
Speaker 1:  and maybe most compelling thing in this phone lineup. And

163
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:40,685
Speaker 1:  Chris, I particularly, I want you to explain this phone to me because you

164
00:10:40,685 --> 00:10:44,445
Speaker 1:  just wrote a, a thing that I would call like a, a deep backhanded

165
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:48,405
Speaker 1:  compliment to The Pixel fold where you're kind of like, I love

166
00:10:48,405 --> 00:10:52,005
Speaker 1:  this thing, it sucks. I can't wait for them to do it better. So

167
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:55,725
Speaker 1:  so tell me, tell me about the, the new pixel fold and, and what it seems

168
00:10:55,725 --> 00:10:56,845
Speaker 1:  like Google maybe did right this time.

169
00:10:57,245 --> 00:11:00,325
Speaker 7:  So they changed the whole form factor. So the first fold was like a passport

170
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:04,445
Speaker 7:  style, like short and squat. And that was fun. Like the outer screen was

171
00:11:04,445 --> 00:11:07,565
Speaker 7:  like not quite as tall as most phones you could use with one hand very easily.

172
00:11:07,945 --> 00:11:11,205
Speaker 7:  And then when you opened it, it was like a very wide like inner screen. Now

173
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:13,645
Speaker 7:  they're going towards like the one plus open direction where it's like a

174
00:11:13,645 --> 00:11:16,845
Speaker 7:  very tall outer screen. It's like a normal phone. It's like a 6.3 inch display,

175
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:18,965
Speaker 7:  like just like The Pixel nine display essentially it's like the same size.

176
00:11:19,105 --> 00:11:21,765
Speaker 7:  So you've got like a whole phone on the outside now, so you're not really

177
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:24,845
Speaker 7:  like making any compromises there. And then you open it up, it's just like

178
00:11:24,845 --> 00:11:28,805
Speaker 7:  a giant, like whole tablet now. So the first to, I like

179
00:11:28,805 --> 00:11:32,485
Speaker 7:  had a ton of like black bars with many apps on the sides 'cause like it's

180
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:35,365
Speaker 7:  Android and no one actually like, you know, cares about like one device.

181
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:38,645
Speaker 7:  So hopefully now Google's gonna say that like all these apps are gonna like

182
00:11:38,645 --> 00:11:41,725
Speaker 7:  open full screen by default now. So it's gonna have like better app compatibility

183
00:11:42,265 --> 00:11:45,085
Speaker 7:  and it's way brighter too. Like the first fold wasn't that bright outside

184
00:11:45,085 --> 00:11:48,405
Speaker 7:  this one, it was like very, very, very bright. So they have like fixed many

185
00:11:48,405 --> 00:11:51,165
Speaker 7:  problems. The cameras are still nowhere near as good as the pros obviously

186
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:54,165
Speaker 7:  that's the main issue. And there's just, just like not much room to fit,

187
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,845
Speaker 7:  super nice cameras in there. So that's the main compromise you're gonna make

188
00:11:57,845 --> 00:12:01,685
Speaker 7:  if there is one. But it just seems like a super refined, nice version of

189
00:12:01,685 --> 00:12:04,045
Speaker 7:  the first fold. It's like what the first fold should have been essentially.

190
00:12:04,145 --> 00:12:07,405
Speaker 7:  And, but it's but it's now $1,800, which is

191
00:12:07,715 --> 00:12:08,805
Speaker 7:  extremely expensive.

192
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:11,165
Speaker 6:  Hmm. Improve flatness. It

193
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:11,805
Speaker 7:  Is very flat

194
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:16,045
Speaker 1:  18. Yeah. I just, the price kills me and it's like Google, if I, if they

195
00:12:16,045 --> 00:12:19,485
Speaker 1:  made me the CEO of Google, I would be willing to lose so much money on pixel

196
00:12:19,575 --> 00:12:23,205
Speaker 1:  folds just to like, this is, this is your chance

197
00:12:23,385 --> 00:12:26,485
Speaker 1:  if you're Google. And I want, we're gonna get back to some of the like big

198
00:12:26,485 --> 00:12:30,285
Speaker 1:  picture, where does Google fit into this universe stuff in, in

199
00:12:30,485 --> 00:12:34,445
Speaker 1:  a minute. Because I wrote a bunch of years ago when the first pixel

200
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:38,165
Speaker 1:  came out that this was the best phone on the planet and I believed it then.

201
00:12:38,165 --> 00:12:41,925
Speaker 1:  And I think Google has the potential to do it now and like just keeps getting

202
00:12:41,925 --> 00:12:43,885
Speaker 1:  in its own way in a thousand ways. But we're gonna come back to all of that.

203
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:48,125
Speaker 1:  But this is like, if, if I'm Google, this sounds like a

204
00:12:48,355 --> 00:12:51,525
Speaker 1:  real chance for this company to be like, we have done, we have done the thing

205
00:12:51,555 --> 00:12:54,885
Speaker 1:  like we got it Connor, right? Samsung is getting a little closer to getting

206
00:12:54,885 --> 00:12:58,765
Speaker 1:  it right but is doing sort of a series of boring iterative

207
00:12:58,765 --> 00:13:02,685
Speaker 1:  upgrades. And Alison, I remember at IO last year we were talking and it was

208
00:13:02,685 --> 00:13:06,645
Speaker 1:  like, okay this pixel fold feels like it's not, it's almost there but it's

209
00:13:06,965 --> 00:13:10,565
Speaker 1:  not quite there. And the, the clear vibe from the first pixel fold was like,

210
00:13:10,565 --> 00:13:13,605
Speaker 1:  I cannot wait for the next one when they have another year to push at the

211
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:16,725
Speaker 1:  hardware. Another year of trying to convince people to make these apps. and

212
00:13:16,725 --> 00:13:20,365
Speaker 1:  it feels like this has a real shot of like, this might be the one

213
00:13:20,515 --> 00:13:24,005
Speaker 1:  like in terms of the closest foldable phone to getting it fully right,

214
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:28,325
Speaker 1:  we might be almost there from Google. Am I, am I too excited about this?

215
00:13:29,205 --> 00:13:32,845
Speaker 6:  I I think I'm just like slightly less optimistic. Okay. It does

216
00:13:32,915 --> 00:13:36,765
Speaker 6:  feel like the move they should have made and like the phone that we wanted

217
00:13:36,915 --> 00:13:40,125
Speaker 6:  last year is here. I love the OnePlus open

218
00:13:40,675 --> 00:13:44,605
Speaker 6:  form factor. So like moving towards that I think is a great

219
00:13:44,635 --> 00:13:48,525
Speaker 6:  move that my biggest complaint about the original

220
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:52,325
Speaker 6:  pixel folder is so heavy, it was just uncomfortable to

221
00:13:52,325 --> 00:13:55,765
Speaker 6:  hold it for a while and then it, it can be the best foot in the world but

222
00:13:55,765 --> 00:13:59,245
Speaker 6:  if you don't wanna hold it, there's a problem. So this one's

223
00:13:59,245 --> 00:14:02,845
Speaker 6:  significantly lighter. I think those are all really good things.

224
00:14:03,165 --> 00:14:06,845
Speaker 6:  I think I'm still confused by the, like I get that they have to make trade

225
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:10,765
Speaker 6:  offs for the camera, but if you're putting pro on the name of this

226
00:14:10,775 --> 00:14:14,685
Speaker 6:  phone and you're still having to compromise on

227
00:14:15,065 --> 00:14:15,525
Speaker 6:  the camera,

228
00:14:16,185 --> 00:14:20,085
Speaker 1:  You're also charging $1,800. Exactly. Which I feel as the person who says

229
00:14:20,085 --> 00:14:23,965
Speaker 1:  prices very loudly occasionally on this podcast, it's $1,800.

230
00:14:24,345 --> 00:14:25,485
Speaker 1:  That's so much money.

231
00:14:25,925 --> 00:14:29,125
Speaker 6:  I know that's like the going rate for a folding phone I guess,

232
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,365
Speaker 1:  Which is like fine, I get that. That's, they're expensive and that's what

233
00:14:32,365 --> 00:14:35,405
Speaker 1:  they seem to cost. But like I just don't, and I feel this way with everybody.

234
00:14:35,485 --> 00:14:38,845
Speaker 1:  I don't think you get to make any kind of significant

235
00:14:38,935 --> 00:14:42,805
Speaker 1:  compromise and get away with it at that price. And Google is gonna

236
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:46,285
Speaker 1:  say it can do a lot of stuff in software for the camera and that what a lot

237
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,725
Speaker 1:  of people are doing with the camera is not taking photos. They're doing all

238
00:14:48,725 --> 00:14:52,645
Speaker 1:  this AI stuff and that's all well and good but I do think the, we

239
00:14:52,645 --> 00:14:55,605
Speaker 1:  are going to end up pretty rigorously stress testing this thing. And I think

240
00:14:55,605 --> 00:14:58,925
Speaker 1:  there is absolutely no room for error in the camera in these folds because

241
00:14:58,925 --> 00:15:02,805
Speaker 1:  they're just too expensive. Agreed. V are you a folding phone person? I

242
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:04,405
Speaker 1:  don't feel like you and I have ever talked about folding phones.

243
00:15:04,915 --> 00:15:08,765
Speaker 5:  It's too expensive for me. I am a cheap ass with my phones.

244
00:15:09,835 --> 00:15:13,245
Speaker 5:  Well not really because I have the iPhone provac.

245
00:15:13,785 --> 00:15:17,165
Speaker 5:  You know what I really don't like is I don't like how they keep adding adjectives

246
00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:19,805
Speaker 5:  to the ends of these phones along with numbers. Correct. So that it's like

247
00:15:19,805 --> 00:15:23,725
Speaker 5:  an alphabet soup. But like I'm always intrigued by them. I just,

248
00:15:23,865 --> 00:15:27,485
Speaker 5:  so I take my phone running and I have this feeling of

249
00:15:28,105 --> 00:15:31,925
Speaker 5:  if I drop this while I'm running 'cause I have eaten

250
00:15:31,985 --> 00:15:35,285
Speaker 5:  it while running before, I'm just gonna sit there and be like,

251
00:15:35,985 --> 00:15:39,765
Speaker 5:  no I'm bleeding. But also the repair

252
00:15:39,955 --> 00:15:43,725
Speaker 5:  bill, I'm bleeding both my blood and money.

253
00:15:44,345 --> 00:15:48,005
Speaker 5:  So that's why I haven't gotten any kind of

254
00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:51,645
Speaker 5:  folding phone yet because then I would feel the need to have like a safe

255
00:15:51,695 --> 00:15:55,645
Speaker 5:  phone for running and then that's, we're getting into two phone, three

256
00:15:55,645 --> 00:15:59,605
Speaker 5:  phone territory. I'm already have, I'm all, I'm already dual wielding phones

257
00:15:59,795 --> 00:16:02,925
Speaker 5:  because they've decided to make it so that wear West

258
00:16:03,885 --> 00:16:07,565
Speaker 5:  watches don't work with an iPhone. I used to be able to get away with one

259
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:11,485
Speaker 5:  phone and test all of these watches. Nope. I have to have two fricking phones

260
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:15,405
Speaker 5:  at all times now. So welcome to my, I don't need a third, I

261
00:16:15,405 --> 00:16:19,045
Speaker 5:  don't need a third folding phone. even though I would like one, I would just

262
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:22,805
Speaker 5:  wanna play around with it. But you know, I'm still mad at you David

263
00:16:22,865 --> 00:16:26,565
Speaker 5:  for talking about the book's Palma so much. So stop asking me to buy more

264
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:27,245
Speaker 5:  things. I

265
00:16:27,245 --> 00:16:31,085
Speaker 1:  Talked about it once. Everybody needs to leave me alone about this. I

266
00:16:31,085 --> 00:16:34,525
Speaker 1:  got very excited about it one time and I was right

267
00:16:34,985 --> 00:16:38,805
Speaker 1:  and now this is, this is somehow my legacy as I have convinced too many people

268
00:16:38,805 --> 00:16:42,725
Speaker 1:  to buy this deeply overpraised adorable little gadget and to all

269
00:16:42,725 --> 00:16:46,685
Speaker 1:  those people, I'm not sorry at all remotely. Sorry. Just be glad

270
00:16:46,845 --> 00:16:50,485
Speaker 1:  v that they didn't release a pixel ring because I, I literally had the thought

271
00:16:50,505 --> 00:16:53,045
Speaker 1:  in going through this that like v it's gonna run outta fingers. Like it's

272
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,285
Speaker 1:  just, we're just, we're toast here.

273
00:16:54,745 --> 00:16:57,885
Speaker 5:  So like I, I'm basically testing all of these and I've narrowed it down to

274
00:16:57,885 --> 00:17:01,765
Speaker 5:  the three that I think are the best. If they came out with a pixel ring,

275
00:17:02,305 --> 00:17:05,525
Speaker 5:  that's probably next year. But if they came out with a pixel ring this year,

276
00:17:05,765 --> 00:17:09,485
Speaker 5:  I would be in so much trouble. I already have

277
00:17:09,825 --> 00:17:11,685
Speaker 5:  six ring tans. It's bad.

278
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:14,245
Speaker 1:  So let's actually move on to the wearables 'cause while we're just running

279
00:17:14,245 --> 00:17:16,525
Speaker 1:  through the news, let's run through the news. So the, the Pixel Watch three,

280
00:17:16,855 --> 00:17:19,725
Speaker 1:  which I am reliably told is the new one.

281
00:17:20,825 --> 00:17:22,165
Speaker 1:  What's the deal with the Pixel Watch three?

282
00:17:22,435 --> 00:17:26,285
Speaker 5:  Well there's a new size now there after everyone complained that the

283
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:29,685
Speaker 5:  41 millimeter is too small, they have now come out with a 45

284
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:33,565
Speaker 5:  millimeter and then they were like, okay so the hardware, it's basically

285
00:17:33,565 --> 00:17:37,245
Speaker 5:  gonna look the same as last year. Except we're gonna add an ultra wide man

286
00:17:37,445 --> 00:17:41,085
Speaker 5:  chip and actual displays. They're Viggo writer bold

287
00:17:41,225 --> 00:17:45,005
Speaker 5:  now. Yeah sure they look the same. Most people

288
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:48,005
Speaker 5:  looking at the watches are just gonna be like that. That sure is a watch

289
00:17:48,005 --> 00:17:51,925
Speaker 5:  that bezels are 16% slimmer. Love that. And then they were just

290
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:55,765
Speaker 5:  like, and here is a laundry list of software updates that there's,

291
00:17:55,985 --> 00:17:59,605
Speaker 5:  it is physically impossible that I will remember every single bit of

292
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:03,485
Speaker 5:  software that they've crammed into this thing. And it's like actually quite

293
00:18:03,575 --> 00:18:07,285
Speaker 5:  impressive the amount of software updates. There's like You

294
00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:11,525
Speaker 5:  can stream your nest doorbell or cam feed straight to your wrist.

295
00:18:11,705 --> 00:18:15,485
Speaker 5:  You can unlock your BMW if you have a BMW You can also

296
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:19,045
Speaker 5:  unlock your pixel phone. You can do custom

297
00:18:19,275 --> 00:18:22,845
Speaker 5:  runs now, which you know, other watches have been able to do for a long time.

298
00:18:22,845 --> 00:18:26,605
Speaker 5:  But now You can program your actual thing. It's very Garmin like

299
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:30,205
Speaker 5:  you have a morning summary of all of your stuff. There's an auto sleep

300
00:18:30,395 --> 00:18:33,365
Speaker 5:  mode, there's cardio load, it's, it's a lot.

301
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:37,685
Speaker 1:  So Google is is deep in the like health and fitness

302
00:18:37,715 --> 00:18:40,445
Speaker 1:  race now they are like Google, there was a minute at the beginning of the

303
00:18:40,445 --> 00:18:42,805
Speaker 1:  Pixel Watch where Google was doing that but also had some big ideas about

304
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:45,965
Speaker 1:  like the assistant and this is an AI thing and it feels like they're getting

305
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:49,005
Speaker 1:  away from that and just pushing towards this is a health and fitness device.

306
00:18:49,405 --> 00:18:53,325
Speaker 5:  I actually think they're, they're, they're pushing equally okay towards the

307
00:18:53,325 --> 00:18:57,205
Speaker 5:  productivity stuff and the health stuff. It was very heavy on the

308
00:18:57,205 --> 00:19:00,725
Speaker 5:  productivity stuff first I think because they were mostly coasting on Fitbit

309
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:04,485
Speaker 5:  exists. This is a Fitbit platform. Sure. Now this time around they've basically

310
00:19:04,485 --> 00:19:08,205
Speaker 5:  gone, what is Garmin doing and let's just add it to the watch.

311
00:19:08,445 --> 00:19:11,925
Speaker 5:  So there's like a morning summary. Now, you know Garmin,

312
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:16,525
Speaker 5:  a couple of generations ago they introduced this thing called morning Morning

313
00:19:16,545 --> 00:19:20,365
Speaker 5:  report and it'll tell you like your overnight stats and the

314
00:19:20,365 --> 00:19:24,125
Speaker 5:  weather so that You can wake up and go like, oh it's 90 degrees time

315
00:19:24,145 --> 00:19:27,485
Speaker 5:  to die on this five mile run. So now the Google

316
00:19:27,815 --> 00:19:31,765
Speaker 5:  Pixel Watch three is gonna do that and then, you know, they're adding

317
00:19:31,765 --> 00:19:35,725
Speaker 5:  something called cardio load. Now I think if you've ever used a Garmin

318
00:19:35,825 --> 00:19:39,645
Speaker 5:  or a Polar or just like a multi-sport watch, you know what cardio load is.

319
00:19:40,065 --> 00:19:43,725
Speaker 5:  But that's not really something we've seen on these major flagship watches

320
00:19:43,905 --> 00:19:47,765
Speaker 5:  to be like, what's your cardio load And cardio load is basically how

321
00:19:47,795 --> 00:19:51,765
Speaker 5:  intensely your heart has been working in your workouts over

322
00:19:51,845 --> 00:19:55,365
Speaker 5:  a period of time. And it's kind of a gauge of like, oh, you know, maybe

323
00:19:55,705 --> 00:19:59,645
Speaker 5:  my cardio load is really high, I should ease off or just do more

324
00:19:59,645 --> 00:20:03,285
Speaker 5:  like, I hate this but like zone two training,

325
00:20:03,595 --> 00:20:07,245
Speaker 5:  it's, it's, it's very triggering to hear zone two training for me. So, you

326
00:20:07,245 --> 00:20:10,925
Speaker 5:  know, that's what that cardio load thing is. And then, you know, custom running

327
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:14,205
Speaker 5:  workouts and running metrics like vertical oscillation,

328
00:20:14,745 --> 00:20:18,685
Speaker 5:  stride cadence, vertical oscillation is the most useless metric by the way.

329
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,405
Speaker 5:  I don't know what you're supposed to do with that. It just tells you how

330
00:20:21,425 --> 00:20:25,325
Speaker 5:  far up and down you move while you run and like the less the better, but

331
00:20:25,585 --> 00:20:29,445
Speaker 5:  you're just gonna, what do you whatcha gonna do? I'm a bouncy runner.

332
00:20:29,505 --> 00:20:31,725
Speaker 5:  How are you gonna change the fact that you're a bouncy runner anyway? But

333
00:20:31,725 --> 00:20:34,365
Speaker 5:  it's gonna tell you all those things. There's a new running dashboard within

334
00:20:34,425 --> 00:20:37,925
Speaker 5:  the, the Fitbit app. It's, it's a lot of stuff

335
00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:42,125
Speaker 5:  and just like, oh the the biggest one that I haven't mentioned that yet is

336
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:46,085
Speaker 5:  that it can now detect a loss of a pulse and

337
00:20:46,085 --> 00:20:47,925
Speaker 5:  call emergency services for you.

338
00:20:48,035 --> 00:20:48,725
Speaker 1:  That seems good.

339
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:52,725
Speaker 5:  Loss of pulse. Like it's basically like are you dying? Yeah,

340
00:20:52,765 --> 00:20:56,645
Speaker 1:  I, love it. Loss of pulse is such an amazing euphemism. Yeah this is

341
00:20:56,645 --> 00:20:57,805
Speaker 1:  a serious one, right?

342
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:01,605
Speaker 5:  Yeah, yeah it's very serious. So it's like, you know, if you overdose, if

343
00:21:01,605 --> 00:21:04,725
Speaker 5:  you have a heart attack and you're alone, it's gonna call

344
00:21:04,995 --> 00:21:08,965
Speaker 5:  emergency services for you in the eu, not in the US yet.

345
00:21:09,205 --> 00:21:13,085
Speaker 5:  'cause obviously this needs regulatory. Go ahead

346
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:17,005
Speaker 5:  for that because the potentials for a false alarm are

347
00:21:17,005 --> 00:21:20,205
Speaker 5:  very scary. I talked to Google and they were like sensor fusion.

348
00:21:21,095 --> 00:21:24,845
Speaker 5:  Don't worry if you just take your watch off, which is a loss of pulse

349
00:21:24,935 --> 00:21:28,885
Speaker 5:  event, it's not gonna call emergency services. But you know, that's like

350
00:21:28,915 --> 00:21:32,765
Speaker 5:  kind of an interesting thing from Google because thus far they have

351
00:21:32,865 --> 00:21:35,885
Speaker 5:  pretty much been playing catch up in the smartwatch space. They are very

352
00:21:35,885 --> 00:21:39,725
Speaker 5:  late. We're only on iteration three of the Pixel Watch Apple Watch.

353
00:21:39,725 --> 00:21:43,485
Speaker 5:  We're coming out with number 10 and Samsung's fucked

354
00:21:43,505 --> 00:21:47,445
Speaker 5:  up their numbering such a long time ago, but we are already on seven.

355
00:21:47,905 --> 00:21:51,605
Speaker 5:  So you know, there they're pr there are several generations behind, but they

356
00:21:51,665 --> 00:21:54,685
Speaker 5:  are coming out with a health feature that nobody else has

357
00:21:55,505 --> 00:21:59,125
Speaker 5:  by gen three. And you know, they say it's because the Pixel Watch samples

358
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:02,925
Speaker 5:  your heart rate at a, at a much, much, much higher frequency than other

359
00:22:03,085 --> 00:22:06,725
Speaker 5:  flagship smart watches. Which is true because they're doing it every other

360
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:10,525
Speaker 5:  second, most other smart watches, unless you are in the middle of a

361
00:22:10,525 --> 00:22:14,125
Speaker 5:  workout, will do it once every five minutes or so. So, you know,

362
00:22:14,595 --> 00:22:18,165
Speaker 5:  it's, it is something that they can differentiate themselves with. So many

363
00:22:18,165 --> 00:22:22,125
Speaker 5:  updates. I liter, I'm sure I forgot like five or six software

364
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,205
Speaker 5:  updates in there. Yeah.

365
00:22:23,305 --> 00:22:26,965
Speaker 1:  But there's an interesting theme there, which is like down this deep

366
00:22:27,765 --> 00:22:31,405
Speaker 1:  tracking yourself rabbit hole, which is kind of what everyone has, has leaned

367
00:22:31,405 --> 00:22:34,005
Speaker 1:  into in this space, which makes a lot of sense. Two more questions on this

368
00:22:34,025 --> 00:22:36,205
Speaker 1:  and then we're gonna take a break and then we're gonna do the rest of these

369
00:22:36,205 --> 00:22:39,935
Speaker 1:  gadgets. Question number one, Fitbit. Where

370
00:22:42,155 --> 00:22:45,735
Speaker 5:  Fitbit is increasingly going the way of nest in that like

371
00:22:45,955 --> 00:22:49,455
Speaker 5:  it is a word that we use. There's a lot of history there. Technically you

372
00:22:49,455 --> 00:22:53,095
Speaker 5:  still are using the Fitbit app but is all Google now baby.

373
00:22:53,235 --> 00:22:56,695
Speaker 5:  That's what it simplification of Fitbit is I think

374
00:22:57,195 --> 00:23:00,895
Speaker 5:  almost complete. I think next year is the deadline for migrating

375
00:23:01,075 --> 00:23:04,735
Speaker 5:  all of your Fitbit accounts over to Pixel or Google

376
00:23:04,735 --> 00:23:08,295
Speaker 5:  accounts rather And. if you wanna buy the new watches, you gotta migrate.

377
00:23:08,475 --> 00:23:09,735
Speaker 5:  So e

378
00:23:10,195 --> 00:23:13,695
Speaker 1:  My absolute hottest take on all of this is that Google branded these exactly

379
00:23:13,705 --> 00:23:16,895
Speaker 1:  wrong. That it should have gone all the way into the Fitbit

380
00:23:17,425 --> 00:23:20,695
Speaker 1:  brand and all of these products should be called Fitbits, which were like,

381
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:24,535
Speaker 1:  Fitbit was like Kindle and Kleenex for the longest time and Google was just

382
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:27,255
Speaker 1:  like, nah, nevermind. Nobody, nobody knows what Fitbits are. They're like

383
00:23:27,255 --> 00:23:27,815
Speaker 1:  Pixel watches.

384
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:32,095
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it's weird because they still have some Fitbits. It's just this

385
00:23:32,525 --> 00:23:36,335
Speaker 5:  main flagship Fitbit watch that's actually a Pixel watch.

386
00:23:36,635 --> 00:23:40,495
Speaker 5:  And I think that's just probably part of their ecosystem play because

387
00:23:40,555 --> 00:23:44,335
Speaker 5:  you do see it working more with other Google services

388
00:23:44,485 --> 00:23:48,365
Speaker 5:  offline maps, you have Google maps, offline maps now. So there that, that's

389
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:51,645
Speaker 5:  why. But at the same time it's just very confused

390
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:56,085
Speaker 5:  and it was more so confused with the original and the Pixel Watch too. So.

391
00:23:57,115 --> 00:24:00,725
Speaker 1:  Okay, last question on the Pixel Watch if memory serves, we have

392
00:24:00,825 --> 00:24:04,685
Speaker 1:  broken our review unit both years of the Pixel Watch.

393
00:24:04,885 --> 00:24:05,205
Speaker 1:  I believe

394
00:24:06,015 --> 00:24:10,005
Speaker 5:  Chris cracked the first one. I cracked the second one. Oh

395
00:24:10,005 --> 00:24:10,165
Speaker 5:  Chris,

396
00:24:10,165 --> 00:24:13,725
Speaker 1:  That was you the first time. Yeah. Yeah. And I, if, if memory serves, it

397
00:24:13,725 --> 00:24:17,645
Speaker 1:  was one of those like you didn't do anything and then it was cracked. That's

398
00:24:17,645 --> 00:24:18,205
Speaker 7:  How it went. Yeah,

399
00:24:18,205 --> 00:24:22,125
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that Google doesn't believe me, put it on a

400
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:25,165
Speaker 5:  charger, looked at it and I was like, why is it scratched to hell and back

401
00:24:25,165 --> 00:24:28,125
Speaker 5:  and everyone's like, you, there's no way you got those scratches without

402
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:32,005
Speaker 5:  knowing what you did. I don't know what I did. They it, I woke up and it

403
00:24:32,005 --> 00:24:33,685
Speaker 5:  was scratched. So yeah.

404
00:24:33,825 --> 00:24:37,685
Speaker 1:  And that to me is like the bar for me, right? It's like if I fall on the

405
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:40,885
Speaker 1:  ground and scrape it against concrete and it scratches, like I understand

406
00:24:40,885 --> 00:24:44,485
Speaker 1:  how that happens, but if I don't even know how it got scratched and it

407
00:24:44,485 --> 00:24:47,685
Speaker 1:  scratched, that's that's, that's a you problem. It's just a very fragile

408
00:24:47,685 --> 00:24:50,885
Speaker 7:  Design, you know, it's like a glass dome that's gonna happen. Totally.

409
00:24:50,985 --> 00:24:52,405
Speaker 5:  And it's not sapphire. Yeah.

410
00:24:52,685 --> 00:24:56,565
Speaker 6:  I will say I wear a pixel watch with most of the Android phones are

411
00:24:56,685 --> 00:25:00,645
Speaker 6:  reviewed and I'm just a dingus. I'm like always ram it into

412
00:25:00,795 --> 00:25:01,725
Speaker 6:  like a doorway.

413
00:25:01,725 --> 00:25:04,805
Speaker 1:  Allison is seven feet tall is an important thing to tell everybody.

414
00:25:05,325 --> 00:25:09,045
Speaker 6:  It's like flailing all the time. It's been okay. I don't have any, I don't

415
00:25:09,045 --> 00:25:10,285
Speaker 6:  have any scratches. I dunno.

416
00:25:10,285 --> 00:25:14,245
Speaker 5:  Okay. I I was totally fine with the first one. I, I legitimately am telling

417
00:25:14,245 --> 00:25:17,325
Speaker 5:  you I went to bed and I either put it on the charger where I was wearing

418
00:25:17,325 --> 00:25:21,205
Speaker 5:  it, I don't remember. It was zero ago. I woke up, it looked like my cat

419
00:25:21,205 --> 00:25:24,925
Speaker 5:  went to town on it, but my cat did not go to town on it. So I,

420
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:29,045
Speaker 5:  I don't know what happened. Google actually took the watch from me and they

421
00:25:29,045 --> 00:25:32,685
Speaker 5:  sent it to a lab and they were like, abrasions happened. Whoa. I was like,

422
00:25:32,685 --> 00:25:36,045
Speaker 5:  well no shit, but I, we don't know what they were.

423
00:25:36,195 --> 00:25:39,005
Speaker 1:  Abrasions happened Is the title of your memoir by the way? Just to Yeah,

424
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:42,565
Speaker 1:  just to put that out there right now. A any word on if this one is going

425
00:25:42,565 --> 00:25:45,925
Speaker 1:  to be better at that stuff? Do we have any like we've been saying since the

426
00:25:45,925 --> 00:25:49,165
Speaker 1:  jump that one of the worries of this design was that it would be more fragile

427
00:25:49,305 --> 00:25:52,445
Speaker 1:  and that has clearly I would say proven out over time. No changes this time,

428
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:52,845
Speaker 1:  no

429
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:56,285
Speaker 7:  Changes. Yeah, I'm very excited for the big watch, but like that's even more

430
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:59,525
Speaker 7:  like surface area for it to be damaged, so we'll see. Right.

431
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:02,405
Speaker 1:  All right, all right, fair enough. All right, well we gotta take a break,

432
00:26:02,425 --> 00:26:04,645
Speaker 1:  but we have a couple more GA to get to. We'll be right back.

433
00:31:05,595 --> 00:31:08,715
Speaker 7:  case. The case now has a speaker on the outside, so if you lose it, you'll

434
00:31:08,715 --> 00:31:11,515
Speaker 7:  make a noise. So some small quality of life improvements, but yeah, the main

435
00:31:11,515 --> 00:31:15,435
Speaker 7:  things are the much better A NC and the sound quality, which we'll see.

436
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:18,555
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I'm very curious to see how the sound quality turns out because like,

437
00:31:18,555 --> 00:31:21,635
Speaker 1:  at least for my purposes, it's always been good enough. Yeah, definitely

438
00:31:21,735 --> 00:31:25,595
Speaker 1:  not best in class, but good enough. and it was the, the pairing was super

439
00:31:25,595 --> 00:31:29,155
Speaker 1:  easy. I always found them more comfortable than most of the other ones. I

440
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:31,755
Speaker 1:  think they super comfortable, they just fit my ears better for whatever reason.

441
00:31:32,055 --> 00:31:35,995
Speaker 1:  And I always thought their noise cancellation was pretty good. Anyway, they

442
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:39,515
Speaker 1:  do a really good job with noise cancellation on mic performance. We've tested

443
00:31:39,515 --> 00:31:43,475
Speaker 1:  them on the show and they, they did some, they did really well canceling

444
00:31:43,475 --> 00:31:46,595
Speaker 1:  out noise as you're talking into them. So if they can like vastly improve

445
00:31:46,595 --> 00:31:49,755
Speaker 1:  that again yeah, that's pretty exciting. Yeah, absolutely. But yeah, they're

446
00:31:49,755 --> 00:31:53,275
Speaker 1:  like, they're just AirPods for Android territory and I think that is a useful

447
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:56,835
Speaker 1:  and good thing and frankly every company is gonna end up having those and

448
00:31:56,835 --> 00:32:00,355
Speaker 1:  that works fine. Now we get to the big news, big news, which is, which is

449
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:03,635
Speaker 1:  the, the death of Chromecast. This is the real story here.

450
00:32:04,305 --> 00:32:07,715
Speaker 1:  This is, I, I went on vacation Google lost an

451
00:32:07,715 --> 00:32:11,355
Speaker 1:  antitrust trial and killed Chromecast and it was just, I was like, I don't

452
00:32:11,355 --> 00:32:14,395
Speaker 1:  know how I'm supposed to deal with this when I don't have a podcast on which

453
00:32:14,395 --> 00:32:18,275
Speaker 1:  to talk about this. So Chris, gimme the quick rundown both on the new

454
00:32:18,275 --> 00:32:22,115
Speaker 1:  thing that is coming out and the old thing that is dying. What,

455
00:32:22,115 --> 00:32:22,995
Speaker 1:  what's going on here? Yeah,

456
00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:26,115
Speaker 7:  So the new thing is the Google TV streamer. Quite a name,

457
00:32:26,515 --> 00:32:29,955
Speaker 1:  Terrible name by the way. Just before, just before we get in, awful awful

458
00:32:29,985 --> 00:32:30,275
Speaker 1:  name,

459
00:32:30,965 --> 00:32:34,915
Speaker 7:  Chromecast had brand recognition, but now let's do Google TV streamer.

460
00:32:34,985 --> 00:32:36,435
Speaker 7:  This flows right off the tongue,

461
00:32:36,695 --> 00:32:39,500
Speaker 1:  It really does. What if we had more pixel streamer, pick that, pick

462
00:32:39,685 --> 00:32:43,645
Speaker 7:  Anything. So it costs a hundred bucks. It's a box now, it's not a dongle

463
00:32:43,645 --> 00:32:47,285
Speaker 7:  anymore. So it's a set top box. It's, it's nice, it's pretty, it's got like

464
00:32:47,285 --> 00:32:51,005
Speaker 7:  a built-in ethernet jack, which is nice to have on streamers all the time.

465
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:55,085
Speaker 7:  But it runs the same like software as the most recent Chromecast. So you're

466
00:32:55,085 --> 00:32:58,605
Speaker 7:  gonna have all that, it'll have like Gemini AI features. Sure

467
00:32:58,965 --> 00:33:01,925
Speaker 7:  it's gonna be 20% faster than the Chromecast. People have always been like

468
00:33:01,925 --> 00:33:05,685
Speaker 7:  waiting for like a fast Chrome cast. And so they claim that like the Nvidia

469
00:33:05,805 --> 00:33:09,365
Speaker 7:  Shield was their like main like goalpost here to reach. I don't, I don't

470
00:33:09,365 --> 00:33:12,925
Speaker 7:  think it's gonna reach that because like 20% faster than the 4-year-old Chromecast

471
00:33:12,925 --> 00:33:16,805
Speaker 7:  with Google TV is like still not gonna be a barn burner of a, of a

472
00:33:16,805 --> 00:33:19,485
Speaker 7:  device. And it's like most of our comments were like, that's not gonna get

473
00:33:19,485 --> 00:33:22,125
Speaker 7:  it done for me. I'm gonna, you know, just go buy an Apple tv, yada yada.

474
00:33:22,645 --> 00:33:25,285
Speaker 7:  But the Chromecast is dead, but the casting feature is still alive and well

475
00:33:25,285 --> 00:33:29,205
Speaker 7:  obviously, so You can still cast to the box, do all the same stuff, but the

476
00:33:29,205 --> 00:33:31,205
Speaker 7:  name is now gone. Quick

477
00:33:31,205 --> 00:33:34,965
Speaker 1:  Poll before, before I, I get it. How do all of you do your

478
00:33:34,965 --> 00:33:38,285
Speaker 1:  smart TV stuff? Like v what's your, what's your smart TV situation like when

479
00:33:38,285 --> 00:33:39,965
Speaker 1:  you wanna watch Netflix on your tv, what do you have?

480
00:33:40,365 --> 00:33:42,125
Speaker 5:  I got two Apple TVs.

481
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,325
Speaker 1:  Okay. Allison, what about you? We

482
00:33:44,325 --> 00:33:47,125
Speaker 6:  Have a Samsung tv. We do all the built-in apps.

483
00:33:47,585 --> 00:33:48,765
Speaker 5:  Oh my god, that's so brave.

484
00:33:49,105 --> 00:33:51,805
Speaker 1:  No, well, so okay, we're gonna come back to that because I think, I think

485
00:33:52,315 --> 00:33:55,965
Speaker 1:  this is the whole point of this device. Chris, what's yours?

486
00:33:56,205 --> 00:33:59,925
Speaker 7:  I mean I have everything. So I've got the Apple tv, fire TV, cube,

487
00:34:00,565 --> 00:34:01,125
Speaker 7:  Roku, ultra.

488
00:34:01,195 --> 00:34:04,365
Speaker 1:  What is your like main when you're like not thinking about work and you're

489
00:34:04,365 --> 00:34:06,605
Speaker 1:  just like, I just wanna sit down and watch something. Which remote you grab?

490
00:34:06,835 --> 00:34:08,205
Speaker 7:  It's the Apple TV 4K.

491
00:34:08,355 --> 00:34:12,245
Speaker 1:  Okay. So if I, if I were to like big picture, try

492
00:34:12,245 --> 00:34:16,045
Speaker 1:  and explain what Google is doing here. It seems like the thesis is if you

493
00:34:16,195 --> 00:34:19,845
Speaker 1:  want just a simple kind of cheap,

494
00:34:20,175 --> 00:34:23,725
Speaker 1:  don't really worry about it. Way to stream shows

495
00:34:23,915 --> 00:34:26,445
Speaker 1:  performance isn't amazing, but you just like need a thing that plays your

496
00:34:26,445 --> 00:34:30,365
Speaker 1:  shows. You, you kind of have agent in it choice, right? Like your, your

497
00:34:30,465 --> 00:34:33,085
Speaker 1:  TV probably does it. You probably have a dongle that does it. You probably

498
00:34:33,085 --> 00:34:35,805
Speaker 1:  have a box that does it. Your cable company will happily give you one. Like

499
00:34:35,805 --> 00:34:38,845
Speaker 1:  there's a million ways to do it. And so if you want to

500
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:42,885
Speaker 1:  differentiate and win, you have to do

501
00:34:42,885 --> 00:34:46,605
Speaker 1:  better, right? And, and we've been in this weird space for the last few years

502
00:34:46,605 --> 00:34:50,485
Speaker 1:  where the only ones doing better have been the Apple TV

503
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:54,325
Speaker 1:  and the Nvidia Shield, both of which are like old outdated devices at this

504
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:57,645
Speaker 1:  point. But both of which were so far beyond everybody else that they continue

505
00:34:57,645 --> 00:35:01,005
Speaker 1:  to be the only options if you're like, I want my TV to be fast.

506
00:35:01,465 --> 00:35:04,845
Speaker 1:  And on the, on the one hand I think that the idea of let's compete at the

507
00:35:04,845 --> 00:35:08,205
Speaker 1:  top end and make them better and make people want to buy them instead of

508
00:35:08,205 --> 00:35:11,965
Speaker 1:  just the default thing that they have is very exciting. But I do, I kind

509
00:35:11,965 --> 00:35:15,645
Speaker 1:  of agree with our commenters in the sense that I'm not sure, at least from

510
00:35:15,645 --> 00:35:19,205
Speaker 1:  what we've seen so far, we'll have to test the thing and see that this

511
00:35:19,545 --> 00:35:22,365
Speaker 1:  is that thing. Like if Google had come out and been like, we have five Xed

512
00:35:22,365 --> 00:35:25,845
Speaker 1:  the performance of the Chromecast, it's gonna blow your freaking mind

513
00:35:26,005 --> 00:35:29,405
Speaker 1:  through the back of your head and it's $500

514
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:30,645
Speaker 7:  People would've freaked out.

515
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:34,885
Speaker 1:  Yeah, but I am, I am I, am I thinking about this the right way Chris? Like

516
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:36,365
Speaker 1:  is that your read on the situation too? Yeah,

517
00:35:36,365 --> 00:35:39,405
Speaker 7:  Yeah, for sure. I think like they're saying prices like their ceiling for

518
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:41,845
Speaker 7:  like what they can do as far as like a device, which is fine, but even then

519
00:35:41,885 --> 00:35:44,645
Speaker 7:  I think you could have squeezed some out, just toss like a 2-year-old tensor

520
00:35:44,645 --> 00:35:47,245
Speaker 7:  in there, you know, like what's the issue here? Like you've got your own

521
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:51,045
Speaker 7:  silicon, like toss a tensor G one in there, you know, or whatever they are

522
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:54,205
Speaker 7:  and just, yeah, so like 20%, I mean it's not nothing. It's got like twice

523
00:35:54,205 --> 00:35:57,645
Speaker 7:  the ram, which should also help out quite a bit. But as far as like a speed

524
00:35:57,645 --> 00:36:01,205
Speaker 7:  demon, you know, this is probably not gonna be quite that. We could see a

525
00:36:01,205 --> 00:36:04,965
Speaker 7:  new Apple TV this fall. So that would just be like Apple just kind of like

526
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:08,965
Speaker 7:  lapping them again very quickly. So we'll see how that shakes out.

527
00:36:09,185 --> 00:36:12,525
Speaker 1:  Alison, is is there anything here for you? Are you excited about this at

528
00:36:12,525 --> 00:36:15,725
Speaker 1:  all? I just, they're they're going for you, right? Like you're now the person

529
00:36:15,905 --> 00:36:19,645
Speaker 1:  who is not gonna buy a Chromecast and because your TV does it fine,

530
00:36:20,355 --> 00:36:21,725
Speaker 1:  they're trying to give you something else.

531
00:36:22,115 --> 00:36:25,885
Speaker 6:  Okay. You know what they don't have is there's a all the like

532
00:36:25,905 --> 00:36:29,845
Speaker 6:  10,000 free, you know, ad supported channels on the Samsung tv.

533
00:36:30,265 --> 00:36:34,165
Speaker 6:  We have one called Ocean Vibes and that's just plays

534
00:36:34,355 --> 00:36:38,285
Speaker 6:  when we o when we turn the TV on is the best

535
00:36:38,285 --> 00:36:42,165
Speaker 6:  thing in the world. There's just like fish swimming around and coral reefs

536
00:36:42,425 --> 00:36:45,925
Speaker 6:  and you just sit there and you're like, yeah, this is all right.

537
00:36:46,345 --> 00:36:49,965
Speaker 6:  So talk to me. No, talk to me when you have

538
00:36:50,015 --> 00:36:51,725
Speaker 6:  ocean vibes Google

539
00:36:52,355 --> 00:36:56,245
Speaker 1:  That is so diametrically opposed from the answer I was expecting from you

540
00:36:56,485 --> 00:36:56,765
Speaker 1:  I. love it.

541
00:36:56,985 --> 00:36:58,285
Speaker 7:  That's great. That's

542
00:36:58,365 --> 00:37:02,085
Speaker 1:  A fantastic, fantastic outcome. But yeah, I mean, and I think

543
00:37:02,225 --> 00:37:06,005
Speaker 1:  to some extent Chris, like the, this, this is the thing here, right? Is if

544
00:37:06,005 --> 00:37:09,565
Speaker 1:  I'm Google and I am curious what they've been telling all of you about the,

545
00:37:09,565 --> 00:37:13,205
Speaker 1:  the AI stuff coming in general here, because I'm very excited about The Pixel

546
00:37:13,205 --> 00:37:16,805
Speaker 1:  screenshots feature, which is like a sort of managed

547
00:37:17,105 --> 00:37:20,285
Speaker 1:  AI organized library of all the screenshots you take. I think that's very

548
00:37:20,285 --> 00:37:24,165
Speaker 1:  smart. But in general, the idea here is like we're going to put lots of new

549
00:37:24,165 --> 00:37:26,725
Speaker 1:  power into these new devices, dot, dot

550
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:31,645
Speaker 1:  ai, and I don't know, at least from what I've seen so far, again, it's Monday

551
00:37:31,645 --> 00:37:34,165
Speaker 1:  as we're recording this, the event is on Tuesday. I'm very curious to see

552
00:37:34,165 --> 00:37:38,005
Speaker 1:  if they can find a way to make a really compelling AI case for this stuff.

553
00:37:38,345 --> 00:37:42,005
Speaker 1:  But with a TV streamer in particular, I'm like, okay, you're giving me theoretically

554
00:37:42,005 --> 00:37:45,845
Speaker 1:  more power other than my apps launch faster, which is meaningful to me, but

555
00:37:45,845 --> 00:37:46,525
Speaker 1:  not to most people.

556
00:37:46,985 --> 00:37:50,525
Speaker 7:  You can use Gemini to make screen saves, which is interesting

557
00:37:50,965 --> 00:37:53,445
Speaker 7:  because they see like how all the frame TV's doing. So they're like, you

558
00:37:53,445 --> 00:37:54,685
Speaker 7:  know, you've got this whole ambient mode

559
00:37:54,825 --> 00:37:57,525
Speaker 1:  So Gemini can make you open ocean vibes.

560
00:37:58,225 --> 00:38:01,165
Speaker 6:  Yes. Oh no, no, that'll be your ocean vibes. I don't, I don't want real ocean.

561
00:38:01,285 --> 00:38:04,365
Speaker 6:  I don't want your AI ocean vibes.

562
00:38:05,385 --> 00:38:09,325
Speaker 7:  So there's that. And also I guess they're gonna do summaries now, so

563
00:38:09,325 --> 00:38:11,685
Speaker 7:  they already show you like the Rotten Tomato scores for movies, but now it's

564
00:38:11,685 --> 00:38:14,525
Speaker 7:  gonna like us bring in content from across the web. So it might be like,

565
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,805
Speaker 7:  here's what someone on Reddit said about this show. Hopefully not that, but

566
00:38:17,805 --> 00:38:18,885
Speaker 7:  you know, we'll see. Oh

567
00:38:19,225 --> 00:38:19,445
Speaker 6:  God.

568
00:38:19,845 --> 00:38:22,885
Speaker 7:  So that's the other thing is like summaries for everything that you are like

569
00:38:23,265 --> 00:38:26,925
Speaker 7:  seeing and browsing. But beyond that, you know,

570
00:38:27,345 --> 00:38:29,005
Speaker 7:  not, not too much compelling. Which

571
00:38:29,005 --> 00:38:31,845
Speaker 1:  Kind of brings me back to like, I'm, I'm very sad that Chromecast has gone

572
00:38:31,845 --> 00:38:35,045
Speaker 1:  because I, I continue to think the Chromecast was a really good idea

573
00:38:35,795 --> 00:38:39,485
Speaker 1:  because I think this might be an unpopular opinion. I have no idea how people

574
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:42,685
Speaker 1:  feel. I think Google TV is like by a mile the best

575
00:38:42,915 --> 00:38:46,085
Speaker 1:  interface. Yeah, I like it a lot. It, it does a really good job of like,

576
00:38:46,195 --> 00:38:49,325
Speaker 1:  it's, it's very content first, but it also makes getting to the apps easy.

577
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:53,885
Speaker 1:  Apple is super App first. I think the Fire TV is mostly

578
00:38:53,885 --> 00:38:57,765
Speaker 1:  just trash. Roku is super app first and I think Google TV

579
00:38:57,915 --> 00:39:01,765
Speaker 1:  like does a pretty good job of showing you everything you would wanna see

580
00:39:01,765 --> 00:39:05,565
Speaker 1:  relatively in one place. And so for me, like I have a Roku TV

581
00:39:05,585 --> 00:39:09,445
Speaker 1:  and I bought an Apple TV that I just use instead on my Roku tv.

582
00:39:09,445 --> 00:39:13,325
Speaker 1:  So my Roku TV's one job is just to take me to my Apple TV because it is

583
00:39:13,325 --> 00:39:17,245
Speaker 1:  like an unusable interface on this trash TCL TV I bought at Costco a

584
00:39:17,245 --> 00:39:17,725
Speaker 1:  million years ago.

585
00:39:17,795 --> 00:39:19,965
Speaker 7:  That is probably true for many people these days. Yeah,

586
00:39:20,215 --> 00:39:24,125
Speaker 1:  Right. So I think if, if I'm Google I'm like, okay, keep pushing at

587
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:27,805
Speaker 1:  this idea of like a 30, $50 way to give you Google tv, which is

588
00:39:27,905 --> 00:39:31,605
Speaker 1:  better. And, and I feel like what Google is instead doing is saying, okay,

589
00:39:31,605 --> 00:39:34,845
Speaker 1:  we wanna, they're, they're like splitting a weird difference between make

590
00:39:34,845 --> 00:39:38,565
Speaker 1:  it easy to get Google TV and make a really powerful box. It seems like they're

591
00:39:38,565 --> 00:39:41,965
Speaker 1:  kind of in a middle ground that I'm not super positive is gonna work for

592
00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:45,045
Speaker 7:  Them. Yeah. They're not gonna make anybody happy. It's like not quite the

593
00:39:45,045 --> 00:39:48,885
Speaker 7:  full speed right box and not the cheap thing that the Chromecast was either.

594
00:39:49,185 --> 00:39:51,605
Speaker 7:  So we'll see. I mean I'm looking forward to checking it out, you know, if

595
00:39:51,605 --> 00:39:54,085
Speaker 7:  it's faster, that'll be, that'll make a big difference. But yeah, I love

596
00:39:54,085 --> 00:39:57,765
Speaker 7:  Google tv. Like you David, the ads aren't as in your face as Roku or

597
00:39:57,945 --> 00:40:01,685
Speaker 7:  you know, so there's that. But yeah, we'll see. I'm excited to check it out.

598
00:40:01,715 --> 00:40:04,845
Speaker 7:  It's shipping like last among all these devices in like late September, so

599
00:40:04,845 --> 00:40:08,125
Speaker 7:  it's gonna be a while before we get it in our hands, but it's coming.

600
00:40:08,435 --> 00:40:12,205
Speaker 1:  Yeah, it's, it's gonna be an interesting fall for a lot of that stuff, so,

601
00:40:12,205 --> 00:40:15,005
Speaker 1:  okay. Any other announcements coming? You, y'all have gotten all the news,

602
00:40:15,005 --> 00:40:18,285
Speaker 1:  seen all the things. Any, any other like newsy cleanup we should do here

603
00:40:18,285 --> 00:40:21,565
Speaker 1:  before we talk Big picture? What is the future of Google and everything?

604
00:40:22,585 --> 00:40:22,805
Speaker 6:  No.

605
00:40:23,035 --> 00:40:24,965
Speaker 1:  Have you, have any of you tried Pixel screenshots?

606
00:40:25,485 --> 00:40:28,445
Speaker 7:  They showed me a very, very briefly, it seemed cool that they did a search

607
00:40:28,445 --> 00:40:31,285
Speaker 7:  for like someone's wifi password that, that someone had like sent like a

608
00:40:31,285 --> 00:40:35,005
Speaker 7:  screenshot of Oh that seems to be like the example every company shows. But

609
00:40:35,005 --> 00:40:36,245
Speaker 6:  It's a separate app, right?

610
00:40:36,355 --> 00:40:37,285
Speaker 7:  Yeah, it's a separate app.

611
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,445
Speaker 1:  Okay. Oh, it's its own app. It's not like, I assumed it was like in the,

612
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:43,085
Speaker 1:  in the photos app in Interesting. That's what

613
00:40:43,085 --> 00:40:46,885
Speaker 6:  I'm so curious about is like, that sounds great. We've got

614
00:40:46,885 --> 00:40:50,325
Speaker 6:  that feature over there. Like how do you bring it all together? Is it gonna

615
00:40:50,345 --> 00:40:54,005
Speaker 6:  be Gemini, is it gonna, am I gonna have to pay for

616
00:40:54,365 --> 00:40:57,525
Speaker 6:  a version of Gemini that's gonna do all these things? I don't know. That's,

617
00:40:57,665 --> 00:41:01,365
Speaker 6:  that's where I am with AI on pixel phones right now. Yeah. Is like,

618
00:41:02,075 --> 00:41:02,725
Speaker 6:  show it to me.

619
00:41:03,185 --> 00:41:06,885
Speaker 1:  My thing is like, I was thinking about this recently, my go-to use case

620
00:41:06,985 --> 00:41:10,285
Speaker 1:  is, so we live maybe like a mile down the street from the library

621
00:41:10,985 --> 00:41:14,765
Speaker 1:  and I'm frequently walking past the library and every once in a while they

622
00:41:14,765 --> 00:41:18,525
Speaker 1:  put up a banner with the dates of the book sales that they're doing.

623
00:41:18,905 --> 00:41:22,525
Speaker 1:  And every single time I take a picture of the banner 'cause I'm like, oh,

624
00:41:22,525 --> 00:41:25,805
Speaker 1:  I have to remember when the book sale is and every single time it just goes

625
00:41:25,805 --> 00:41:29,085
Speaker 1:  into my camera roll and disappears. Like all of those photos and screenshots

626
00:41:29,085 --> 00:41:31,725
Speaker 1:  and that kind of stuff does where I'm like, oh, this is a thing I should

627
00:41:31,725 --> 00:41:34,685
Speaker 1:  buy and then it goes into my camera roll and disappears. And so the idea

628
00:41:34,785 --> 00:41:38,765
Speaker 1:  of like I can just sort of constantly tell my phone, this is

629
00:41:38,765 --> 00:41:41,285
Speaker 1:  the thing I think is interesting and then it can make sense of all that for

630
00:41:41,285 --> 00:41:45,245
Speaker 1:  me is so compelling to me and I think makes way more sense than all the

631
00:41:45,245 --> 00:41:49,125
Speaker 1:  recall stuff is. Like I, all I have to do is tell it remember this for me

632
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:53,005
Speaker 1:  and it will do it. Like that is perfect. But I think you,

633
00:41:53,025 --> 00:41:55,725
Speaker 1:  to your point Alison, like how you integrate that with everything else makes

634
00:41:55,725 --> 00:41:59,205
Speaker 1:  a lot of sense. 'cause if I have to take a photo and then put it in the screenshots

635
00:41:59,205 --> 00:42:02,045
Speaker 1:  app, I'm gonna forget to do that. And I have now solved none of my problem.

636
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:06,125
Speaker 1:  So I think it's, it's gonna be a really interesting like push and pull there

637
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:09,325
Speaker 1:  trying to figure out how do you make this not creepy, but really seamless

638
00:42:10,225 --> 00:42:13,325
Speaker 1:  but not too in your face as you're trying to do other stuff. Which I feel

639
00:42:13,325 --> 00:42:16,285
Speaker 1:  like it's kind of the story of all things AI and Google right now.

640
00:42:16,795 --> 00:42:20,005
Speaker 6:  Yeah, that is the thing I want, I want to be able to

641
00:42:20,555 --> 00:42:24,405
Speaker 6:  look up the door code for the Airbnb without like digging through

642
00:42:24,465 --> 00:42:28,365
Speaker 6:  emails or logging into Airbnb or whatever. I,

643
00:42:28,605 --> 00:42:32,125
Speaker 6:  I don't need to put a hat on a picture of a

644
00:42:32,295 --> 00:42:34,685
Speaker 6:  bunny that I took. What do you

645
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:34,845
Speaker 5:  Mean?

646
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:37,485
Speaker 1:  To be fair, you have been doing that nonstop for

647
00:42:37,485 --> 00:42:41,445
Speaker 6:  Weeks, which I have been, it's a blast. But honestly it's

648
00:42:41,445 --> 00:42:44,605
Speaker 6:  where we're at I think with Apple Intelligence, which is still, you know,

649
00:42:44,745 --> 00:42:48,485
Speaker 6:  in developer preview blah blah blah. It's like,

650
00:42:48,515 --> 00:42:52,205
Speaker 6:  it's still missing that thing of like, what is gonna tie it all

651
00:42:52,405 --> 00:42:56,365
Speaker 6:  together and am I just gonna be able to be like, Gemini, put the book

652
00:42:56,365 --> 00:43:00,165
Speaker 6:  sale on my calendar, tell me if I have a conflict or something.

653
00:43:00,185 --> 00:43:03,485
Speaker 6:  Or or is it gonna just be like, I don't know.

654
00:43:04,765 --> 00:43:08,645
Speaker 5:  I think the latter. Yeah. Based on the history of AI

655
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:09,725
Speaker 5:  features. Yeah.

656
00:43:09,945 --> 00:43:13,765
Speaker 6:  I'm so nervous about it because I got, I'm doing the labs

657
00:43:14,105 --> 00:43:17,925
Speaker 6:  for the labs like preview for Gemini in your

658
00:43:17,925 --> 00:43:21,365
Speaker 6:  Gmail. They fi which they like finally integrated and I was like, great,

659
00:43:21,675 --> 00:43:25,605
Speaker 6:  I'll search for this order number for my shoes and it does its thing

660
00:43:25,605 --> 00:43:28,765
Speaker 6:  and it's like thinking, it's like there's no order number for your shoes.

661
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:32,965
Speaker 6:  I'm like, this is no, you had one job like it, it was

662
00:43:32,965 --> 00:43:36,885
Speaker 6:  right there. And like I tried it again later and it it

663
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:40,485
Speaker 6:  able to do it. I don't know why you got caught up that time. It's like, it

664
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:44,365
Speaker 6:  feels that one time for you and you're like, why am I gonna try and use this

665
00:43:44,365 --> 00:43:45,325
Speaker 6:  again? I'm not.

666
00:43:45,715 --> 00:43:48,805
Speaker 1:  Yeah, it it is really funny. We're, we're in this phase with so many of these

667
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:52,965
Speaker 1:  features where like, because I have this specific problem that these

668
00:43:52,965 --> 00:43:56,845
Speaker 1:  things can solve for me, I'm willing to try any of them, but the tech

669
00:43:56,955 --> 00:44:00,885
Speaker 1:  broadly speaking just isn't there. And so like you try it twice

670
00:44:01,265 --> 00:44:04,485
Speaker 1:  and it doesn't work and it's like, well that's pretty much that.

671
00:44:05,265 --> 00:44:07,525
Speaker 5:  Yep. Or you could get nagged by it.

672
00:44:07,665 --> 00:44:08,685
Speaker 1:  Oh yeah. Oh my god.

673
00:44:08,865 --> 00:44:12,525
Speaker 5:  Google is is just basically also kind of following

674
00:44:12,555 --> 00:44:16,525
Speaker 5:  Samsung's lead and I forgot, but they're adding AI suggested workouts to

675
00:44:16,665 --> 00:44:19,725
Speaker 5:  the Pixel Watch three based on like your metrics.

676
00:44:20,105 --> 00:44:23,925
Speaker 1:  My suggestions are gonna be like, just do anything. Just stand up. Just just

677
00:44:23,925 --> 00:44:26,205
Speaker 1:  what if you just walked around for once in your life? But,

678
00:44:26,385 --> 00:44:29,045
Speaker 5:  But you know, they were showing it to me and they were like, oh you know,

679
00:44:29,185 --> 00:44:33,085
Speaker 5:  you haven't really been pushing it in terms of cardio load and you

680
00:44:33,115 --> 00:44:36,965
Speaker 5:  took a rest, so why don't you do like a bunch of sprints and

681
00:44:36,995 --> 00:44:37,485
Speaker 5:  it's just like,

682
00:44:37,485 --> 00:44:38,325
Speaker 6:  Oh, get

683
00:44:38,325 --> 00:44:42,245
Speaker 5:  Outta here. Oh fine. I mean it's hard, it's hard. Building a training plan

684
00:44:42,265 --> 00:44:45,125
Speaker 5:  is hard but that I was just like, okay, if my

685
00:44:45,255 --> 00:44:47,805
Speaker 6:  Pixel watch tells me I'm gonna throw it into the sea.

686
00:44:48,235 --> 00:44:50,925
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Wait v can we talk about the notification you got from your galaxy

687
00:44:50,925 --> 00:44:54,045
Speaker 1:  ring? This is just a little, little, little diversion into v's experience.

688
00:44:54,205 --> 00:44:58,085
Speaker 5:  I was about to say. So like I, you know, I'm sinking my ring this morning

689
00:44:58,525 --> 00:45:02,485
Speaker 5:  looking at the energy score and it's like, hey, you need to move around or

690
00:45:02,545 --> 00:45:06,165
Speaker 5:  you might start gaining weight. No. And I was like, excuse me, what,

691
00:45:06,475 --> 00:45:10,005
Speaker 5:  what I ran three miles this morning, go to jail.

692
00:45:10,235 --> 00:45:10,525
Speaker 5:  Wait,

693
00:45:10,525 --> 00:45:13,525
Speaker 1:  Is that, that's literally the words that it said you or you might start gaining

694
00:45:13,525 --> 00:45:13,805
Speaker 1:  weight.

695
00:45:14,115 --> 00:45:16,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Hold on, let me, lemme look at this.

696
00:45:16,605 --> 00:45:17,285
Speaker 1:  Absolutely not.

697
00:45:17,635 --> 00:45:21,445
Speaker 5:  Your active time has decreased compared to your usual insufficient

698
00:45:21,725 --> 00:45:25,605
Speaker 5:  activity may result in weight gain and other health issues. Try

699
00:45:26,005 --> 00:45:29,565
Speaker 5:  standing up, moving around and reducing your sedentary time.

700
00:45:29,865 --> 00:45:33,685
Speaker 5:  And it's because I let this dumb ring die yesterday so it didn't, it

701
00:45:33,685 --> 00:45:37,445
Speaker 5:  didn't basically like capture my three mile run yesterday too.

702
00:45:37,925 --> 00:45:41,325
Speaker 5:  'cause you know, I'd be out here doing 10 hours of workouts a week,

703
00:45:41,785 --> 00:45:45,725
Speaker 5:  but you know, just like it thinks I missed one day and it's like, get

704
00:45:45,725 --> 00:45:49,525
Speaker 5:  up hoe move around. Oh my gosh the ai, you might gain

705
00:45:49,525 --> 00:45:53,205
Speaker 5:  weight. And I was just like, yeah, but what if I want it? I'm trying to get

706
00:45:53,225 --> 00:45:56,845
Speaker 5:  jacked, I wanna gain weight 'cause muscles are heavier. It's so,

707
00:45:57,315 --> 00:45:59,125
Speaker 5:  there's a lot of nuance and context

708
00:46:38,065 --> 00:46:38,285
Speaker 1:  I'm

709
00:48:23,535 --> 00:48:24,615
Speaker 15:  policy is, what a

710
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:22,435
Speaker 1:  it for a long time. Never say never with Google, but it feels like this

711
00:51:22,435 --> 00:51:26,075
Speaker 1:  matters to Google in a very real way. What I still wonder

712
00:51:26,255 --> 00:51:30,195
Speaker 1:  and what seems to be true is that Google has not made

713
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:34,035
Speaker 1:  any kind of like mainstream dent as a hardware

714
00:51:34,035 --> 00:51:37,355
Speaker 1:  company yet. I think ironically like the Chromecast was probably the most

715
00:51:37,355 --> 00:51:40,515
Speaker 1:  successful piece of hardware Google ever made. It was a huge hit, especially

716
00:51:40,515 --> 00:51:44,155
Speaker 1:  at the beginning 'cause it was cheap and it worked really well and there's

717
00:51:44,155 --> 00:51:48,075
Speaker 1:  really nothing since then that feels like a sort

718
00:51:48,075 --> 00:51:51,955
Speaker 1:  of gigantic mainstream winner. Like there is still very much Apple and Samsung,

719
00:51:51,955 --> 00:51:55,875
Speaker 1:  especially in the United States. And then like gigantic gap down to

720
00:51:55,875 --> 00:51:56,635
Speaker 1:  Google. I

721
00:51:56,635 --> 00:52:00,275
Speaker 5:  Would argue that the Pixel Watch is actually kind of the opposite

722
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:04,195
Speaker 5:  really. I think Samsung is hurting a little bit and they're having to

723
00:52:04,435 --> 00:52:07,995
Speaker 5:  actually bring up their game a little. And because the Pixel Watch

724
00:52:08,215 --> 00:52:11,755
Speaker 5:  was wildly popular when it first came out to the point where Samsung was

725
00:52:11,755 --> 00:52:15,555
Speaker 5:  like, uhoh, I gotta do things. Here's a copycat Apple Watch Ultra and a

726
00:52:15,555 --> 00:52:19,475
Speaker 5:  ring. So you know, I think that's surprisingly one area

727
00:52:19,625 --> 00:52:23,435
Speaker 5:  that it's doing pretty well in. But you know, smart watches are kind of

728
00:52:23,435 --> 00:52:27,315
Speaker 5:  bifurcated into iOS and Android at the moment anyway, so it didn't

729
00:52:27,315 --> 00:52:30,675
Speaker 5:  have to really compete with Apple at all because people on Android can't

730
00:52:30,695 --> 00:52:33,915
Speaker 5:  get an Apple watch. It only really had to compete with Samsung, which is

731
00:52:33,915 --> 00:52:37,395
Speaker 5:  weirdly its partner in where OS land.

732
00:52:37,895 --> 00:52:41,835
Speaker 5:  But it's kind of been eating Samsung's lunch for a

733
00:52:41,835 --> 00:52:45,075
Speaker 5:  little bit 'cause it's, I don't know, it's it's, it's interesting. They're

734
00:52:45,075 --> 00:52:49,035
Speaker 5:  doing weird interesting stuff there and it's kind of ecosystemy in a weird

735
00:52:49,035 --> 00:52:49,235
Speaker 5:  way.

736
00:52:49,745 --> 00:52:52,515
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I mean I think the The Pixel watches actually is is a good example

737
00:52:52,515 --> 00:52:56,195
Speaker 1:  and it does seem like, at least on that front, with the first one I remember

738
00:52:56,275 --> 00:52:58,955
Speaker 1:  people being so excited just about the way it looked that it was like this

739
00:52:58,955 --> 00:53:02,795
Speaker 1:  is the first smartwatch that doesn't sort of scream technology at

740
00:53:02,795 --> 00:53:06,395
Speaker 1:  you. And that was, that was a big win for Google. So maybe that's

741
00:53:06,695 --> 00:53:08,915
Speaker 1:  one of the answers to my question, which is gonna be, do we see anything

742
00:53:08,915 --> 00:53:12,715
Speaker 1:  here that feels like it has kind of breakout potential? I think

743
00:53:12,975 --> 00:53:16,275
Speaker 1:  I'm maybe the most bullish of the four of us on the possibility that the

744
00:53:16,345 --> 00:53:19,995
Speaker 1:  fold could be a winner. I think at $1,800 there's a pretty big

745
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:24,195
Speaker 1:  within low cap on how big a winner it can possibly be.

746
00:53:24,495 --> 00:53:27,525
Speaker 1:  But from the stuff that you've seen and you know, y'all have been testing

747
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:31,045
Speaker 1:  and talking to folks about these things for years now, do we see anything

748
00:53:31,045 --> 00:53:34,765
Speaker 1:  that's sort of a, a possible kind of game changer in the Google hardware

749
00:53:34,965 --> 00:53:35,045
Speaker 1:  business

750
00:53:35,595 --> 00:53:39,365
Speaker 7:  Screenshots app? I dunno, it really comes down to like past

751
00:53:39,365 --> 00:53:41,965
Speaker 7:  years have always been, oh the camera is great. Which it still is. Like people

752
00:53:41,965 --> 00:53:45,765
Speaker 7:  know that The Pixel camera is great. Like that's its like main thing. But

753
00:53:45,765 --> 00:53:48,725
Speaker 7:  this year it feels like all this AI stuff, like if it works it's gonna be

754
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:52,565
Speaker 7:  great. You know, like if it doesn't then it's gonna be meh. Like I see pixels

755
00:53:52,565 --> 00:53:55,325
Speaker 7:  out in the world, like I think they're selling some, they are selling a few.

756
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:58,605
Speaker 7:  So I think like, you know, they've got a base of customers but it's like

757
00:53:58,605 --> 00:54:01,205
Speaker 7:  how do you get them to upgrade? 'cause like hardware is like all the same

758
00:54:01,235 --> 00:54:05,085
Speaker 7:  year over like all these like Pixel nine Pro and Pixel nine. It's like there

759
00:54:05,085 --> 00:54:08,405
Speaker 7:  was some like tensor G four benchmarks. It's like barely faster than last

760
00:54:08,405 --> 00:54:11,805
Speaker 7:  year's chip. So like it's not gonna be like that. That's not why you're gonna

761
00:54:11,805 --> 00:54:15,165
Speaker 7:  upgrade. You're gonna upgrade four Gemini potentially for like some of these

762
00:54:15,165 --> 00:54:17,885
Speaker 7:  new camera software features. It's like software, software, software this

763
00:54:17,885 --> 00:54:21,405
Speaker 7:  year. And so like if the screenshot app works, like that's gonna be great

764
00:54:21,585 --> 00:54:25,245
Speaker 7:  and if it doesn't then it's then I'm going to buy the fold and

765
00:54:25,725 --> 00:54:29,005
Speaker 7:  for the next five years that'll be my phone because I can't afford an $1,800

766
00:54:29,005 --> 00:54:29,285
Speaker 7:  phone.

767
00:54:29,565 --> 00:54:32,885
Speaker 1:  I was gonna say, and and you are historically representative of people who

768
00:54:32,885 --> 00:54:35,845
Speaker 1:  buy smartphones. Yeah. So that, that makes perfect sense. Exactly. No, I

769
00:54:35,845 --> 00:54:39,045
Speaker 1:  mean the, the AI thing I think is, is a really interesting point because

770
00:54:39,185 --> 00:54:43,005
Speaker 1:  the bet from all of these companies really is that they can take

771
00:54:43,165 --> 00:54:46,845
Speaker 1:  a bunch of kind of little AI things, whether it's in the camera

772
00:54:47,385 --> 00:54:51,205
Speaker 1:  or in the productivity stuff or in some of the wearables and that all of

773
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:54,885
Speaker 1:  that adds up to something that is kind of a tie breaker to

774
00:54:55,015 --> 00:54:58,245
Speaker 1:  other devices. And I feel like, Alison, this has been a theme of a lot of

775
00:54:58,245 --> 00:55:01,165
Speaker 1:  the coverage you've been doing recently is like, does all this AI stuff really

776
00:55:01,165 --> 00:55:04,325
Speaker 1:  add up to anything? And I'm curious how you feel. Obviously we, we have to

777
00:55:04,325 --> 00:55:07,565
Speaker 1:  review all these things, there's still lots to be seen and this is all changing

778
00:55:07,565 --> 00:55:11,525
Speaker 1:  really fast. But do you have an early read of like, is there a kind

779
00:55:11,525 --> 00:55:14,205
Speaker 1:  of whole greater than the sum of its parts in the AI story here?

780
00:55:14,835 --> 00:55:18,805
Speaker 6:  This, I wish I did. This is just one of those like I feel like you

781
00:55:18,805 --> 00:55:22,725
Speaker 6:  gotta live with the phone a little bit to see if it, I, I

782
00:55:22,725 --> 00:55:26,445
Speaker 6:  think, you know, we, we all bought a Chromecast 'cause it solved a problem

783
00:55:26,455 --> 00:55:30,005
Speaker 6:  where like, this is incredible, it's 20 bucks and you just plug it in the

784
00:55:30,005 --> 00:55:33,885
Speaker 6:  back of your tv. I don't see anything like

785
00:55:33,885 --> 00:55:36,285
Speaker 6:  that. You know, like in The

786
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:18,085
Speaker 5:  I think it's just the whole ambient computing thing. Like I think

787
00:56:18,095 --> 00:56:21,645
Speaker 5:  completely to your point, it's gonna be the whole ecosystem play

788
00:56:21,915 --> 00:56:25,565
Speaker 5:  because you know, The Pixel, I'm just, you know, wearable ladies, so of course

789
00:56:25,605 --> 00:56:28,685
Speaker 5:  I think in wearables, but like the Pixel Watch when it came out they were

790
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:32,525
Speaker 5:  like, this works for anyone with any phone. And just increasingly year

791
00:56:32,545 --> 00:56:36,085
Speaker 5:  by year, more and more features are just gonna work better if you have a

792
00:56:36,085 --> 00:56:39,725
Speaker 5:  pixel phone with your pixel watch. So like this year it's gonna be

793
00:56:39,735 --> 00:56:43,445
Speaker 5:  pixel recorder app on the watch, it's gonna be seeing your doorbell

794
00:56:43,475 --> 00:56:46,525
Speaker 5:  feed and it's just gonna be one of those things where

795
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:51,285
Speaker 5:  I think it's just what do my gadgets play

796
00:56:51,285 --> 00:56:55,085
Speaker 5:  well with? And that's how we win dominance. So if the Pixel Watch is

797
00:56:55,085 --> 00:56:58,685
Speaker 5:  great and it works with other pixel hardware, that's Google saying

798
00:56:59,035 --> 00:57:02,845
Speaker 5:  suck it Samsung because who uses smart things? Honest, honest

799
00:57:02,845 --> 00:57:06,445
Speaker 5:  to God. I think that's like kind of what they're doing and why they just

800
00:57:06,445 --> 00:57:10,405
Speaker 5:  go ambient computing when you're now watching every once in a while.

801
00:57:10,475 --> 00:57:11,685
Speaker 5:  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

802
00:57:11,915 --> 00:57:15,805
Speaker 1:  Well, and I think that's, that's what's been so sort of backhanded about

803
00:57:15,845 --> 00:57:19,445
Speaker 1:  Google's entire hardware strategy over the years is that like

804
00:57:19,745 --> 00:57:23,485
Speaker 1:  the reason people end up in the Samsung ecosystem is because they buy

805
00:57:23,715 --> 00:57:27,365
Speaker 1:  Samsung phones and so then, then they're forced to use smart things. Google

806
00:57:27,465 --> 00:57:31,125
Speaker 1:  is trying to convince you that there is some like essential googs

807
00:57:31,195 --> 00:57:34,965
Speaker 1:  that is worth buying into the ecosystem. and it has just always felt like

808
00:57:34,965 --> 00:57:38,645
Speaker 1:  they needed the one hardware victory to get there.

809
00:57:39,305 --> 00:57:43,165
Speaker 1:  And, and it's like people, people want the gadget and then they buy into

810
00:57:43,165 --> 00:57:45,405
Speaker 1:  the software and Google is trying to do that backwards, which I think is

811
00:57:45,405 --> 00:57:49,325
Speaker 1:  really interesting but doesn't really seem like it has worked in a huge way.

812
00:57:49,325 --> 00:57:51,725
Speaker 1:  Obviously time will tell and, and the reviews will be really interesting

813
00:57:51,725 --> 00:57:53,725
Speaker 1:  and I'm, I'm like, I I think it's

814
00:59:32,605 --> 00:59:35,885
Speaker 1:  are more important than I'm realizing You can always email us at Vergecast
