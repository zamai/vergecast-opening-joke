2
00:00:03,385 --> 00:00:07,235
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Inside Baseball. I'm your

3
00:00:07,235 --> 00:00:11,235
Speaker 2:  friend David Pierce, and I am outside for the first time in kind of an alarmingly

4
00:00:11,235 --> 00:00:15,075
Speaker 2:  long time. I was sick most of last week. Plus it's just like gray

5
00:00:15,335 --> 00:00:19,315
Speaker 2:  and dreary and cold and just gross outside. So I've mostly spent

6
00:00:19,315 --> 00:00:22,675
Speaker 2:  the last week just kinda lying on the couch, feeling bad for myself and watching

7
00:00:22,675 --> 00:00:26,595
Speaker 2:  shows I've seen 50 times before, which no complaints. It's a terrific

8
00:00:26,595 --> 00:00:30,075
Speaker 2:  way to spend your life, but I just needed to get outside. So we're just out

9
00:00:30,075 --> 00:00:32,995
Speaker 2:  for a walk. By the way, I've gotten some questions from people over the last

10
00:00:32,995 --> 00:00:36,955
Speaker 2:  couple of weeks who are like, David, what are you doing during these

11
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:40,555
Speaker 2:  intros? Are you actually doing these things or are you like lying to us?

12
00:00:40,935 --> 00:00:44,635
Speaker 2:  And the answer is, I'm always doing these things. I've done these intros

13
00:00:44,665 --> 00:00:48,515
Speaker 2:  from a train. I've done these intros from a paint shop. I've done

14
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:52,235
Speaker 2:  them while putting together Legos. I did one at one point

15
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:56,315
Speaker 2:  like in a courthouse, and I don't think I was supposed to do that. I

16
00:00:56,315 --> 00:00:59,555
Speaker 2:  don't think I got in trouble, but probably not a good idea,

17
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:03,515
Speaker 2:  but I'm here for you. The other question I've gotten a bunch is, David, why

18
00:01:03,515 --> 00:01:06,395
Speaker 2:  do you start the show this way? Nobody cares. Just get to the tech news and

19
00:01:06,395 --> 00:01:09,955
Speaker 2:  to that, I say that is terrific feedback and a perfectly fair point.

20
00:01:10,465 --> 00:01:13,675
Speaker 2:  It's also probably not gonna change. So I'm real sorry about that. Questions

21
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:17,595
Speaker 2:  like that, by the way, are all we're gonna do on this show today. We've

22
00:01:17,595 --> 00:01:20,035
Speaker 2:  gotten a lot of questions over the last week, especially since we launched

23
00:01:20,055 --> 00:01:23,915
Speaker 2:  our subscription last week about The Verge and about The Vergecast and

24
00:01:23,915 --> 00:01:27,715
Speaker 2:  about ads, and about how the media works and about how podcasts work. And

25
00:01:27,715 --> 00:01:31,315
Speaker 2:  so we figured we'd just answer as many of them as we can all in one place.

26
00:01:31,565 --> 00:01:35,115
Speaker 2:  We're gonna talk to Helen Haack, our publisher, and Neela Patel, my

27
00:01:35,115 --> 00:01:39,035
Speaker 2:  co-host, your friend, my boss, about all of this stuff,

28
00:01:39,215 --> 00:01:42,755
Speaker 2:  the business, the editorial, how we think about what we make and who we make

29
00:01:42,755 --> 00:01:46,355
Speaker 2:  it for and how we charge for it. All this stuff. I think this stuff really

30
00:01:46,355 --> 00:01:49,235
Speaker 2:  matters. It's gonna get really wonky and detailed at some points. And if

31
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:53,155
Speaker 2:  you're not interested in like deep thoughts on the future of media, there

32
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:56,235
Speaker 2:  might be spots here that aren't for you. But I think this stuff really matters

33
00:01:56,335 --> 00:01:59,995
Speaker 2:  and it's a story about the internet and about what it means to try and make

34
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:03,035
Speaker 2:  it work. We're going through a lot of this stuff, but we're far from the

35
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:05,955
Speaker 2:  only ones going through it. So I think talking through what it looks like

36
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:09,155
Speaker 2:  and how we're navigating it might actually be interesting. We're gonna find

37
00:02:09,155 --> 00:02:13,075
Speaker 2:  out all that is coming up in just a second. But first, I'm

38
00:02:13,075 --> 00:02:16,195
Speaker 2:  not done on this walk. It feels good to be outside. I forgot how good it

39
00:02:16,195 --> 00:02:19,395
Speaker 2:  feels to be outside. So we're gonna keep doing it then we'll get to it. This

40
00:02:19,395 --> 00:02:20,795
Speaker 2:  is The Vergecast. See you in a sec.

41
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:24,165
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. All right, fun fact it started raining, I

42
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:27,965
Speaker 2:  don't know, 45 seconds after I turned off the camera for that intro,

43
00:04:28,385 --> 00:04:32,365
Speaker 2:  So I went inside. It's better here. I was wrong. Don't

44
00:04:32,365 --> 00:04:36,285
Speaker 2:  listen to me about going outside. Inside is where it's at. Alright, we

45
00:04:36,285 --> 00:04:39,245
Speaker 2:  have a lot of questions to do. Let's just get into it. We're gonna do this

46
00:04:39,305 --> 00:04:43,245
Speaker 2:  in two chunks. First, we're gonna talk to Helen Hala about some

47
00:04:43,245 --> 00:04:47,045
Speaker 2:  of the more sort of explicitly businessy things about

48
00:04:47,465 --> 00:04:50,885
Speaker 2:  The Verge and The Vergecast. I think as you've heard us talk a lot about

49
00:04:50,885 --> 00:04:54,565
Speaker 2:  on this show, we try really hard to keep those two things as far apart as

50
00:04:54,805 --> 00:04:58,765
Speaker 2:  possible. So Helen is gonna talk to us about as much of

51
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:02,325
Speaker 2:  the money as we possibly can. Then Neli is gonna come on and we're gonna

52
00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:06,005
Speaker 2:  talk, I would say more broadly about how we make the show and how we make

53
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:09,405
Speaker 2:  The Verge and how we think about all of this stuff. There's gonna be some

54
00:05:09,405 --> 00:05:13,005
Speaker 2:  overlaps, I suspect, between these two segments because Neli and Helen are

55
00:05:13,005 --> 00:05:16,925
Speaker 2:  both tasked with thinking kind of big picture about The Verge at

56
00:05:16,925 --> 00:05:20,725
Speaker 2:  all times. But it felt useful to pull these two things apart. So

57
00:05:21,015 --> 00:05:24,685
Speaker 2:  first we're gonna talk to Helen. We got some questions including the number

58
00:05:24,685 --> 00:05:28,565
Speaker 2:  one by a mile question that you all had about

59
00:05:28,565 --> 00:05:31,885
Speaker 2:  The Verge and The Vergecast for this meta show. So let's just dive into it.

60
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,045
Speaker 2:  Helen, have luck. Welcome back to the show.

61
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,045
Speaker 5:  Thank you so much. Excited to be here.

62
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:39,845
Speaker 2:  It's been a minute. I feel like you're, you're allowed to invite yourself

63
00:05:39,845 --> 00:05:43,205
Speaker 2:  on anytime. So I assume the fact that it's been a while just means that you

64
00:05:43,205 --> 00:05:46,085
Speaker 2:  don't want to be here ever and I have dragged you here against your will.

65
00:05:46,425 --> 00:05:50,125
Speaker 5:  I'm just an invisible presence behind The Verge that's been here for 10 years

66
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:53,045
Speaker 5:  and is in everyone's dms, but rarely appears in public.

67
00:05:53,465 --> 00:05:54,405
Speaker 2:  Is it 10 years now?

68
00:05:55,265 --> 00:05:56,205
Speaker 5:  It was 10 years in November.

69
00:05:56,205 --> 00:05:59,845
Speaker 2:  David, my, my Helen origin story is that you and I ran

70
00:06:00,045 --> 00:06:03,925
Speaker 2:  CES together one year right after you joined and right

71
00:06:03,925 --> 00:06:07,325
Speaker 2:  before I left. And so we had this like insane

72
00:06:07,685 --> 00:06:11,605
Speaker 2:  crucible of a CES and then parted ways for a long time and

73
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,725
Speaker 2:  now we get to work together again.

74
00:06:12,725 --> 00:06:16,685
Speaker 5:  We spent a lot of time in that CE Cs trailer where

75
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:19,645
Speaker 5:  I learned that David is really good at writing headlines

76
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:24,765
Speaker 5:  and Cs from a VERGE perspective is exhausting,

77
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:25,525
Speaker 5:  but fun.

78
00:06:25,995 --> 00:06:29,805
Speaker 2:  Some, some things don't change, it turns out. Alright, so before we get into

79
00:06:29,805 --> 00:06:32,565
Speaker 2:  some of the questions we got from folks, let's just, let's just set up kind

80
00:06:32,565 --> 00:06:36,325
Speaker 2:  of who you are and what we're doing here. So you're the VIRs publisher,

81
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:37,725
Speaker 2:  what does that mean?

82
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:41,805
Speaker 5:  That means, first and foremost for this show, I'm Eli's boss. That's very

83
00:06:41,805 --> 00:06:45,405
Speaker 5:  important. But what that really means is I am the layer of the company,

84
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:49,405
Speaker 5:  Vox Media, our parent company in between editorial, the newsroom

85
00:06:49,825 --> 00:06:53,685
Speaker 5:  and the business side. So my job is to oversee the

86
00:06:53,685 --> 00:06:56,885
Speaker 5:  newsroom and kind of buffer it from the business things when we talk about

87
00:06:56,885 --> 00:07:00,805
Speaker 5:  the firewall between editorial and business. Hi, I'm Helen, I'm the firewall.

88
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,525
Speaker 5:  You're the firewall, I'm the firewall. That's really good.

89
00:07:04,905 --> 00:07:08,525
Speaker 5:  And So I spend a lot of time making sure that The

90
00:07:08,805 --> 00:07:12,245
Speaker 5:  Verge is making enough money to support our journalism.

91
00:07:13,045 --> 00:07:15,965
Speaker 5:  I spend a lot of time working on management problems,

92
00:07:17,245 --> 00:07:20,925
Speaker 5:  strategy problems. I spend a lot of time on the phone with Neli.

93
00:07:21,345 --> 00:07:25,205
Speaker 5:  But yes, I, I think for you know, all intensive purposes, my

94
00:07:25,205 --> 00:07:28,685
Speaker 5:  most important job is the firewall between the business and The Verge

95
00:07:29,435 --> 00:07:33,365
Speaker 5:  such that we keep it running and keep everyone employed while also doing

96
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:33,765
Speaker 5:  great work.

97
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:37,165
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I feel like I always think of you as the person whose job is to be

98
00:07:37,305 --> 00:07:41,085
Speaker 2:  simultaneously the most high level and the most

99
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:42,685
Speaker 2:  in the weeds of anyone at The Verge.

100
00:07:43,185 --> 00:07:46,445
Speaker 5:  Yes. One way I sometimes explain my job to people is I spend

101
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:50,365
Speaker 5:  30% of my time just on straight up management headaches. I

102
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:54,245
Speaker 5:  spend 30% of my time on what are our biggest businesses that

103
00:07:54,245 --> 00:07:57,965
Speaker 5:  we need to take care of that has historically been advertising. So I spend

104
00:07:57,965 --> 00:08:00,765
Speaker 5:  a bunch of time going to client meetings, events,

105
00:08:02,105 --> 00:08:05,765
Speaker 5:  all of those fun things, and I spend 30% of my time working on new businesses.

106
00:08:05,765 --> 00:08:09,445
Speaker 5:  Where do I think The Verge needs to be in the future? And the biggest one

107
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:12,205
Speaker 5:  of those this year has been subscriptions, which I know we're gonna talk

108
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:12,645
Speaker 5:  about later.

109
00:08:12,795 --> 00:08:16,405
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So to that point actually, one of the questions we've gotten a bit

110
00:08:16,405 --> 00:08:20,165
Speaker 2:  of is both why this, like why

111
00:08:20,185 --> 00:08:23,885
Speaker 2:  do a subscription to the website, but I would say more significantly the

112
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:27,805
Speaker 2:  question seems to be why now as opposed to, you know, people

113
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:30,205
Speaker 2:  who've been doing this for forever, there are lots of folks who haven't.

114
00:08:30,345 --> 00:08:31,285
Speaker 2:  Why was this the time,

115
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,855
Speaker 5:  Well, I'll take those questions maybe separately. Sure. The why subscriptions

116
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:39,855
Speaker 5:  and why now, why subscriptions? I think anyone who listens to The

117
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:43,735
Speaker 5:  Vergecast has heard Neli and you David talk about Google

118
00:08:43,925 --> 00:08:47,695
Speaker 5:  Zero and some of the forces that are shaping the internet in the future.

119
00:08:48,865 --> 00:08:52,135
Speaker 5:  There have been a lot of pressures on media businesses over the years.

120
00:08:52,755 --> 00:08:56,445
Speaker 5:  The Verge is a big advertising business, but when you look at

121
00:08:56,625 --> 00:09:00,165
Speaker 5:  how does a big digital advertising business work today,

122
00:09:00,865 --> 00:09:04,685
Speaker 5:  things that are pressure on that business model, a lot of ad

123
00:09:04,685 --> 00:09:08,645
Speaker 5:  technology is made and sold by companies like Facebook

124
00:09:08,645 --> 00:09:12,005
Speaker 5:  and Google. They own an outsized portion of the total digital media

125
00:09:12,525 --> 00:09:16,485
Speaker 5:  advertising pie. Fox Media has insulated ourselves from that a bit by

126
00:09:16,485 --> 00:09:19,645
Speaker 5:  also having our own ad tech stack called concert, which I don't think we

127
00:09:19,645 --> 00:09:23,405
Speaker 5:  talk enough about, but that's definitely one pressure.

128
00:09:23,435 --> 00:09:27,005
Speaker 5:  Another is the pressure of distribution on our scale. So

129
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:30,765
Speaker 5:  advertising, you make a lot of money in advertising If you could charge high

130
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:34,645
Speaker 5:  rates for it because the product you make is really good or maybe

131
00:09:34,645 --> 00:09:38,005
Speaker 5:  you're not sharing a cut of that with someone else, you make money because

132
00:09:38,265 --> 00:09:42,165
Speaker 5:  you're reaching a lot of people. And that's where distribution has really

133
00:09:42,235 --> 00:09:46,045
Speaker 5:  changed since, you know, 2016 Facebook was sending a

134
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:49,405
Speaker 5:  fire hose of traffic to everyone, right? Google has been

135
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,525
Speaker 5:  sending fire hoses of traffic to every publisher in the world. And

136
00:09:53,755 --> 00:09:57,165
Speaker 5:  with the rise of generative search that's changing,

137
00:09:57,505 --> 00:10:01,405
Speaker 5:  search is changing a lot. And so, you know, NELI and I have

138
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:04,565
Speaker 5:  been talking for a long time about how do we prepare The Verge for a point

139
00:10:04,565 --> 00:10:08,205
Speaker 5:  where we're not getting a ton of traffic from other people's platforms

140
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:12,285
Speaker 5:  and so we need our own audience. That was the whole premise of our

141
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:16,565
Speaker 5:  redesigned website in 2022. And so the kind of next

142
00:10:16,565 --> 00:10:20,165
Speaker 5:  extension of that, how do you insulate the business model from

143
00:10:20,475 --> 00:10:24,405
Speaker 5:  some of these big forces? Well, it's subscription. What drives a

144
00:10:24,405 --> 00:10:27,525
Speaker 5:  really good subscriptions business. It's really good content that reaches

145
00:10:27,525 --> 00:10:31,045
Speaker 5:  a lot of loyal people and so it was kind of the obvious

146
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:35,245
Speaker 5:  next place to go. That being said, we've been really

147
00:10:35,725 --> 00:10:39,485
Speaker 5:  cautious, I would say, in how we've approached it to try and keep a big

148
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:43,445
Speaker 5:  free product of The Verge going. At the same time, a

149
00:10:43,445 --> 00:10:47,405
Speaker 5:  lot of people use The Verge as a daily news utility. If we don't wanna be

150
00:10:47,405 --> 00:10:51,045
Speaker 5:  so dependent on other people's distribution, I think we need to tend to that

151
00:10:51,045 --> 00:10:54,725
Speaker 5:  daily habit, make sure we do a good job there. But you know,

152
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:59,165
Speaker 5:  I think the challenges of running an internet content business are

153
00:10:59,165 --> 00:11:02,805
Speaker 5:  huge. They're only getting harder and worse. I think

154
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:06,885
Speaker 5:  the place we need to be to insulate ourselves from all that change is

155
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:10,885
Speaker 5:  to have a healthy subscriptions business. And then why now you know, the

156
00:11:10,885 --> 00:11:14,805
Speaker 5:  best time to launch. What is the cliche saying the best time to plant a

157
00:11:14,805 --> 00:11:18,445
Speaker 5:  tree is 10 years ago, the next best time is tomorrow. Right?

158
00:11:18,835 --> 00:11:21,885
Speaker 5:  Same with subscriptions. The best time to launch a subscription business

159
00:11:21,885 --> 00:11:24,285
Speaker 5:  is 10 years ago. The next best time is tomorrow.

160
00:11:25,195 --> 00:11:29,165
Speaker 2:  Fair enough. Do you think the ultimate goal here is

161
00:11:29,265 --> 00:11:33,165
Speaker 2:  to kind of be all of those things at the same time? Like we, we

162
00:11:33,165 --> 00:11:35,765
Speaker 2:  talk about, you know, there's the, there's an advertising business and there's

163
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:38,445
Speaker 2:  a subscriptions business and there's having a huge audience and there's having

164
00:11:38,485 --> 00:11:42,205
Speaker 2:  a dedicated audience. And I feel like a lot of what we've seen in media

165
00:11:42,275 --> 00:11:45,925
Speaker 2:  over the last few years is people betting on one or the other

166
00:11:46,065 --> 00:11:49,565
Speaker 2:  and very rarely all of the above. Do you think it's possible to bet on all

167
00:11:49,565 --> 00:11:50,005
Speaker 2:  of the above?

168
00:11:50,935 --> 00:11:54,405
Speaker 5:  When you say all of the above? The, the thing I would maybe clarify

169
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:58,365
Speaker 5:  is I think where people got into trouble as media businesses was

170
00:11:58,395 --> 00:12:01,565
Speaker 5:  betting on total traffic and total page use

171
00:12:02,425 --> 00:12:06,165
Speaker 5:  and what has become really clear as X

172
00:12:06,465 --> 00:12:10,165
Speaker 5:  has stopped sending meaningful traffic as Zuckerberg has gotten

173
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:13,445
Speaker 5:  less interested in news, is that

174
00:12:14,315 --> 00:12:18,005
Speaker 5:  true audience is different from a bunch of page views. Yes.

175
00:12:18,545 --> 00:12:21,885
Speaker 5:  And so when we're thinking about what do we need to invest in,

176
00:12:22,315 --> 00:12:26,245
Speaker 5:  it's true audience who comes to us directly, things

177
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:30,005
Speaker 5:  we know about those people, right? Like you could look at the

178
00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:33,805
Speaker 5:  total VERGE page views, but the people who are true VERGE

179
00:12:34,165 --> 00:12:38,125
Speaker 5:  audience, those people on average do a lot of page views for us.

180
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:42,405
Speaker 5:  That's where a lot of our meaningful audience comes from. And so if I were

181
00:12:42,405 --> 00:12:46,245
Speaker 5:  to say what we need is a large, loyal audience of

182
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:50,045
Speaker 5:  real people who truly care about and form habit around The Verge.

183
00:12:50,865 --> 00:12:54,605
Speaker 5:  And that is the single biggest asset. And on that

184
00:12:54,695 --> 00:12:58,645
Speaker 5:  asset you can support several kinds of businesses. You could support

185
00:12:58,825 --> 00:13:02,085
Speaker 5:  an advertising business, you can support a subscriptions business, you could

186
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:05,285
Speaker 5:  support a commerce business. But the true currency

187
00:13:06,115 --> 00:13:10,085
Speaker 5:  that I think any media brand needs in order to survive the next

188
00:13:10,405 --> 00:13:14,045
Speaker 5:  13 years is a direct loyal audience

189
00:13:14,505 --> 00:13:17,645
Speaker 5:  who actually has affinity and builds habit around your brand.

190
00:13:17,955 --> 00:13:21,445
Speaker 2:  Yeah, yeah. I remember my, my old boss at Wired, Nick Thompson always used

191
00:13:21,445 --> 00:13:23,165
Speaker 2:  to say when, when they were doing the paywall over there that

192
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:28,805
Speaker 2:  the beauty of this system is it just aligns us better with the

193
00:13:28,805 --> 00:13:32,565
Speaker 2:  people who read our stuff. He's like, that's just, we're gonna do

194
00:13:32,565 --> 00:13:35,485
Speaker 2:  lots of other things. But this idea that we are now pulling in the same direction

195
00:13:35,745 --> 00:13:39,005
Speaker 2:  as the people who come to our website every day feels pretty good.

196
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You know, I think there's the part of a subscription business that's

197
00:13:42,325 --> 00:13:46,205
Speaker 5:  just business, right? This is another revenue line for us. But one thing

198
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:49,565
Speaker 5:  I'm really excited about is, okay, if we're gonna build

199
00:13:49,755 --> 00:13:53,565
Speaker 5:  loyalty and habit, what we really need people to do is come

200
00:13:53,805 --> 00:13:57,645
Speaker 5:  directly to The Verge, log into The Verge, spend a bunch of time on The Verge,

201
00:13:57,645 --> 00:14:01,365
Speaker 5:  maybe become a commenter, interact with our people and getting

202
00:14:01,365 --> 00:14:04,765
Speaker 5:  people to subscribe and pay for something

203
00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:09,085
Speaker 5:  actually ends up deepening their relationship. And it makes us, I think,

204
00:14:09,235 --> 00:14:12,805
Speaker 5:  more directly accountable to our audience. I think we have always felt directly

205
00:14:12,805 --> 00:14:16,765
Speaker 5:  accountable to our audience, but in a way like you all listeners with Vergecast

206
00:14:16,765 --> 00:14:20,685
Speaker 5:  who might now be VERGE subscribers, you are our clients, we have a

207
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:24,645
Speaker 5:  job we have to do for you, we have standards we have to meet. And

208
00:14:24,685 --> 00:14:28,345
Speaker 5:  I think it aligns editorial and business incentives

209
00:14:28,485 --> 00:14:32,385
Speaker 5:  in a really great way. I wouldn't say that's, that advertising is

210
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,345
Speaker 5:  opposite. You know, I think advertising rewards good journalism

211
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:40,145
Speaker 5:  if you're trying to do, you know, like a good direct

212
00:14:40,545 --> 00:14:44,295
Speaker 5:  advertising business. Yeah. But I am excited for the,

213
00:14:44,395 --> 00:14:46,695
Speaker 5:  the way this will change our relationship to our audience.

214
00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:50,095
Speaker 2:  Totally. Well, with that in mind, let me give you three questions that our

215
00:14:50,295 --> 00:14:52,485
Speaker 2:  audience has been asking us that I think you're the, you're the best person

216
00:14:52,485 --> 00:14:56,405
Speaker 2:  to answer. The first one is, I would

217
00:14:56,405 --> 00:15:00,125
Speaker 2:  say by, by several orders of magnitude, the most asked

218
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:04,445
Speaker 2:  question over the last two weeks, both before and

219
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,845
Speaker 2:  after we announced the subscription, which I gotta kick out of and it is,

220
00:15:07,985 --> 00:15:11,965
Speaker 2:  it is ad free podcasts in general and ad free Vergecast

221
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:14,285
Speaker 2:  in particular that is not part of the subscription.

222
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:19,565
Speaker 2:  Where is, where is your mind and, and the verges mind on

223
00:15:20,265 --> 00:15:21,205
Speaker 2:  ad free podcasts?

224
00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:24,855
Speaker 5:  I love Vergecast listeners, I know you all want ad free podcasting.

225
00:15:26,335 --> 00:15:30,095
Speaker 5:  I think look first David, I wanna set some context about media.

226
00:15:30,675 --> 00:15:34,095
Speaker 5:  It is a bloodbath out there right now. Like our competitors are cutting jobs,

227
00:15:35,005 --> 00:15:38,735
Speaker 5:  newsrooms are moving away from reporting on news journalism, jobs

228
00:15:38,845 --> 00:15:42,775
Speaker 5:  keep going away. And so success for The Verge in our

229
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,735
Speaker 5:  subscription product is not that we are like

230
00:15:46,555 --> 00:15:49,935
Speaker 5:  making a bunch of Im media executives super rich and buying

231
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:54,055
Speaker 5:  Supercars success is like we get to continue to exist and

232
00:15:54,055 --> 00:15:57,935
Speaker 5:  if we're super successful, maybe we get to give a few more journalists jobs

233
00:15:58,005 --> 00:16:01,695
Speaker 5:  next year and have their work here on The Vergecast. So

234
00:16:02,605 --> 00:16:06,295
Speaker 5:  it's, this is not like a big remarkable profit

235
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:10,135
Speaker 5:  engine. The media business famously wildly profitable.

236
00:16:10,195 --> 00:16:13,335
Speaker 2:  You're not buying several fancy new cars as a result of this

237
00:16:13,435 --> 00:16:16,535
Speaker 5:  Is what you're saying. No, I'm so sorry Neli, I won't be buying you a new

238
00:16:16,535 --> 00:16:16,775
Speaker 5:  truck.

239
00:16:18,355 --> 00:16:21,255
Speaker 5:  So if the virtuals really well next year, what that looks like is we get

240
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:24,455
Speaker 5:  give a few more journalist jobs and we get to continue to exist.

241
00:16:25,395 --> 00:16:29,175
Speaker 5:  So I wanna set that context of like what

242
00:16:29,175 --> 00:16:32,575
Speaker 5:  we're trying to do here is continue to exist, make more things, make better

243
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:36,335
Speaker 5:  things, right? But you know, there's a reason PR people outnumber journalists

244
00:16:36,335 --> 00:16:39,855
Speaker 5:  six to one in this country right now. It's because virtually every journalist

245
00:16:39,855 --> 00:16:43,215
Speaker 5:  could leave the industry and make more money elsewhere. A big place The Verge

246
00:16:43,215 --> 00:16:46,135
Speaker 5:  has lost reporters to is actually Google. We love you Dieter,

247
00:16:47,595 --> 00:16:50,415
Speaker 5:  but we don't leave. Like we all care about the work. We really like working

248
00:16:50,415 --> 00:16:54,295
Speaker 5:  with our colleagues. It's kind of earnest and corny. Sorry David, but

249
00:16:54,355 --> 00:16:55,535
Speaker 5:  that's why we keep doing this

250
00:16:55,535 --> 00:16:57,695
Speaker 2:  Thing. I know we try to avoid saying that out loud, but it is true

251
00:16:58,005 --> 00:17:01,535
Speaker 5:  Without the way I've talked a little bit about why subscriptions and why

252
00:17:01,535 --> 00:17:05,455
Speaker 5:  now in the subscription product on the website we did a

253
00:17:05,455 --> 00:17:09,095
Speaker 5:  premium ad experience and we did it instead of an ad-free experience. And

254
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:12,655
Speaker 5:  I'll kind of explain why The Verge makes most of our money in advertising

255
00:17:12,655 --> 00:17:16,535
Speaker 5:  today. We are not in a situation where The Verge is in such trouble.

256
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:20,175
Speaker 5:  We need to make a hard pivot because there's no advertising left. And the

257
00:17:20,175 --> 00:17:23,455
Speaker 5:  only thing that will save us is subscription revenue. We still have a pretty

258
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,455
Speaker 5:  good ad business and we need to take care of that thing because it's going

259
00:17:26,455 --> 00:17:30,095
Speaker 5:  to be paying our bills for the next several years. Subscriptions are a really

260
00:17:30,095 --> 00:17:33,975
Speaker 5:  long game. And so as we build this thing, we cannot afford

261
00:17:33,975 --> 00:17:37,415
Speaker 5:  to mess up our advertising business or the virtual be in bad trouble. So

262
00:17:37,475 --> 00:17:41,415
Speaker 5:  as we were looking though at what do people want from The Verge

263
00:17:41,415 --> 00:17:44,295
Speaker 5:  website? Well they wanted fewer ads, they wanted better ads, they definitely

264
00:17:44,295 --> 00:17:48,015
Speaker 5:  didn't want the churn boxes. And so we said, okay, if we can't do ad free

265
00:17:48,015 --> 00:17:50,805
Speaker 5:  because we need to take care, care of our ad business. And what people are

266
00:17:50,805 --> 00:17:53,605
Speaker 5:  really talking about is they don't want it to interrupt their reading experience

267
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:57,005
Speaker 5:  so much. They don't want some of the like video ads. They don't want the

268
00:17:57,005 --> 00:18:00,205
Speaker 5:  out upgrade chum boxes. We can make that happen, right? So

269
00:18:00,865 --> 00:18:04,365
Speaker 5:  we did a premium ad experience and then benefits of that to the

270
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:08,965
Speaker 5:  ad side are, you know, those chum boxes and some of

271
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:12,765
Speaker 5:  those other ad units, those are served by third parties. And so any ad sold

272
00:18:12,765 --> 00:18:16,125
Speaker 5:  there aren't sold directly by Vox Media. So someone else is taking a cut.

273
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:20,245
Speaker 5:  So when I got rid of those in our subscription, what I can also do is say

274
00:18:20,245 --> 00:18:23,565
Speaker 5:  to our advertisers, If you wanna reach the premium VERGE audience who

275
00:18:24,045 --> 00:18:27,445
Speaker 5:  subscribes and pays for us, the only way to do that is to buy your ads directly

276
00:18:27,445 --> 00:18:30,765
Speaker 5:  from Vox Media. And I love that because then I don't have to give a cut of

277
00:18:30,765 --> 00:18:34,045
Speaker 5:  any revenue to anyone else, right? And that helps me insulate my business.

278
00:18:34,685 --> 00:18:37,805
Speaker 5:  I mentioned earlier Vox Media makes their own ad tech. It's like a weird

279
00:18:37,805 --> 00:18:41,045
Speaker 5:  part of the business, but it's an important thing of like now I can serve

280
00:18:41,045 --> 00:18:44,565
Speaker 5:  my own ads. I don't give anyone else a cut. And so the end

281
00:18:44,685 --> 00:18:48,485
Speaker 5:  result of the premium ad experience on the website is we tend to the ad

282
00:18:48,685 --> 00:18:51,965
Speaker 5:  business, we maybe actually give us a really powerful good tool

283
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:56,085
Speaker 5:  to do better in the ads business. And we do

284
00:18:56,515 --> 00:19:00,125
Speaker 5:  service for our audience to streamline the page, maybe make more people read,

285
00:19:00,175 --> 00:19:03,805
Speaker 5:  maybe make people have a better experience so they read more pages and that

286
00:19:03,805 --> 00:19:07,685
Speaker 5:  it all kind of works. So that's the website. We did

287
00:19:07,685 --> 00:19:11,445
Speaker 5:  not include podcasts at launch in part because we are just trying to

288
00:19:11,445 --> 00:19:14,605
Speaker 5:  launch the best time to launch a subscription is 10 years ago. So we're just

289
00:19:14,605 --> 00:19:18,325
Speaker 5:  trying to get out the door. Yeah. But there's two barriers that make podcast

290
00:19:19,045 --> 00:19:22,725
Speaker 5:  advertising a little bit harder for us to figure out. One is

291
00:19:22,725 --> 00:19:26,525
Speaker 5:  technical and one is business. So I'll talk about those separately. On the

292
00:19:26,525 --> 00:19:30,445
Speaker 5:  technical front, we don't control any of the platforms where people are listening

293
00:19:30,445 --> 00:19:34,285
Speaker 5:  to podcasts. I doubt many of you VERGE casters are like clicking a megaphone

294
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,485
Speaker 5:  embed on our website. If you are we left, I bet you are listening to the

295
00:19:37,485 --> 00:19:41,045
Speaker 5:  show on YouTube in Apple Podcasts and Spotify

296
00:19:41,905 --> 00:19:45,245
Speaker 5:  in wherever you get your podcasts, right? So we don't control that, which

297
00:19:45,245 --> 00:19:49,205
Speaker 5:  means it's a little hard to have an ad-free

298
00:19:49,205 --> 00:19:53,045
Speaker 5:  podcast feed because we're not in control of a platform. So the way

299
00:19:53,045 --> 00:19:56,285
Speaker 5:  most people do it today is they have their main feed which contains ads

300
00:19:56,865 --> 00:20:00,685
Speaker 5:  and then they create a separate feed that is the ad free

301
00:20:00,715 --> 00:20:04,685
Speaker 5:  feed that they give to subscribers that does take people off

302
00:20:04,685 --> 00:20:08,405
Speaker 5:  the main feed, which reduces their total numbers there.

303
00:20:08,705 --> 00:20:12,325
Speaker 5:  And then if the distribution platform does anything algorithmically in terms

304
00:20:12,325 --> 00:20:16,285
Speaker 5:  of recommendations, you've taken a bunch of audience out of your main

305
00:20:16,285 --> 00:20:19,325
Speaker 5:  feed, but you've also taken like the most engaged audience out of that feed.

306
00:20:19,545 --> 00:20:23,445
Speaker 5:  So that can be a little bit risky, right? Right. You know, apple has now

307
00:20:23,725 --> 00:20:27,565
Speaker 5:  offering Apple podcast subscriptions, but that is in their platform. They

308
00:20:27,565 --> 00:20:31,245
Speaker 5:  own the customer relationships, they own the credit cards. That's not good

309
00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:35,005
Speaker 5:  for our business. And so there's the technical barrier, it

310
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:38,885
Speaker 5:  can be overcome, but that's just one thing that we're thinking

311
00:20:38,885 --> 00:20:39,645
Speaker 5:  about that is

312
00:20:39,645 --> 00:20:43,005
Speaker 2:  Both like the beautiful and complicated thing about podcasts is that there

313
00:20:43,005 --> 00:20:46,205
Speaker 2:  just is no one who can wrap their arms around the whole

314
00:20:46,205 --> 00:20:48,565
Speaker 5:  Thing. Yeah. So it's, it's kind of a hacky solution. Yeah, yeah. You make

315
00:20:48,565 --> 00:20:52,445
Speaker 5:  a, you make a separate feed and you give it to a bunch of people and if

316
00:20:52,445 --> 00:20:56,125
Speaker 5:  they unsubscribe, I think it's not really easy to cut them off from that

317
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:59,765
Speaker 5:  feed. But like all of this is like solvable, right? Yeah. It's not ideal

318
00:20:59,905 --> 00:21:02,485
Speaker 5:  but it's solvable. You can come up with solutions. Plenty of people have

319
00:21:02,485 --> 00:21:06,405
Speaker 5:  come up with solutions to do this. I would say the bigger issue for

320
00:21:06,405 --> 00:21:09,725
Speaker 5:  us is the business issue. So when we were launching and we were figuring

321
00:21:09,725 --> 00:21:13,005
Speaker 5:  out what to charge for VERGE subscription, we wanted to keep the price point

322
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:16,965
Speaker 5:  pretty low so that it was accessible to as many people as possible for

323
00:21:16,965 --> 00:21:20,005
Speaker 5:  the people who make The Verge part of their daily utility. And we did not

324
00:21:20,005 --> 00:21:23,965
Speaker 5:  wanna come in super high on pricing and both alienate our

325
00:21:24,085 --> 00:21:27,725
Speaker 5:  core VERGE people, but also like limit the number of people

326
00:21:27,865 --> 00:21:31,645
Speaker 5:  we could, you know, entice into a subscription. The thing is,

327
00:21:31,645 --> 00:21:35,405
Speaker 5:  podcast ads are currently worth more than website ads. I think for those

328
00:21:35,405 --> 00:21:38,965
Speaker 5:  of you who are listening to this podcast, you have David and Neli in your

329
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:42,925
Speaker 5:  ears. It is a more engaging ad

330
00:21:42,925 --> 00:21:46,805
Speaker 5:  format than a banner ad. Even the most engaging banner ad I

331
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:50,365
Speaker 5:  would say, my guess is podcast advertising is by and large

332
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:54,325
Speaker 5:  outperforming some other forms of advertising, which means it's very

333
00:21:54,325 --> 00:21:58,245
Speaker 5:  expensive and advertisers happen to love The Vergecast. As

334
00:21:58,245 --> 00:22:02,125
Speaker 5:  you have seen, advertisers are even buying the lightning round on The Vergecast.

335
00:22:02,265 --> 00:22:04,805
Speaker 2:  We will never understand why, but we are grateful that they do it.

336
00:22:05,865 --> 00:22:09,685
Speaker 5:  So for us to take ads out of The Vergecast for again,

337
00:22:09,985 --> 00:22:13,885
Speaker 5:  the most engaged people, that would cost us a lot of money and it would

338
00:22:13,885 --> 00:22:17,405
Speaker 5:  cost us more money than we are charging for a subscription. So then we have

339
00:22:17,405 --> 00:22:20,765
Speaker 5:  kind of two possibilities. One is to say,

340
00:22:21,475 --> 00:22:25,045
Speaker 5:  okay, is there some kind of ad light experience similar to what we're doing

341
00:22:25,045 --> 00:22:28,885
Speaker 5:  on the website? Like what is fewer ads that's few enough that

342
00:22:29,065 --> 00:22:32,965
Speaker 5:  you vergecast people would not be still furiously angry that there are

343
00:22:32,965 --> 00:22:36,525
Speaker 5:  ads. Is it one pre-roll? Like what does that look like?

344
00:22:37,405 --> 00:22:41,125
Speaker 5:  I think that's one avenue to explore. The other is to say,

345
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:44,845
Speaker 5:  okay, maybe there's a price or a separate tier of VERGE

346
00:22:45,045 --> 00:22:48,525
Speaker 5:  subscription such that we could take all ads outta The Vergecast without

347
00:22:48,525 --> 00:22:52,455
Speaker 5:  killing our business. And I think both of those are things we

348
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:56,135
Speaker 5:  will be exploring. I know people want it, I would like to be able to give

349
00:22:56,135 --> 00:22:59,695
Speaker 5:  it to people and I think we'll be able to figure it out. But those are just

350
00:22:59,695 --> 00:23:03,415
Speaker 5:  the business realities of podcasting ads and why it's a little

351
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:07,215
Speaker 5:  harder for us to lose those. Because again, while I would like

352
00:23:07,455 --> 00:23:10,735
Speaker 5:  everyone here to maybe dream that a ton of people are getting

353
00:23:11,235 --> 00:23:14,935
Speaker 5:  wildly rich off digital media, it is just not the case. Yeah.

354
00:23:15,235 --> 00:23:18,215
Speaker 5:  And so what we are trying to do here is continue to exist,

355
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:20,175
Speaker 5:  hire a few more journalists.

356
00:23:20,685 --> 00:23:24,095
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. The goal is to be able to keep making The Vergecast like that's,

357
00:23:24,095 --> 00:23:27,935
Speaker 2:  that's fundamentally what we're here to do. That's, that's a good

358
00:23:27,935 --> 00:23:30,975
Speaker 2:  answer. And I will say just to everyone who has written in it's, it's this

359
00:23:31,515 --> 00:23:35,255
Speaker 2:  and it's chapters on the podcast and I promise you we hear you

360
00:23:35,435 --> 00:23:38,255
Speaker 2:  and we, we we are, we are thinking about both all the time

361
00:23:39,235 --> 00:23:43,055
Speaker 2:  and, and again, thank you to everybody who writes in and tells us their feelings

362
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:45,965
Speaker 2:  because you all have a lot of them and I very much enjoy it. All right, two

363
00:23:45,965 --> 00:23:49,805
Speaker 2:  more simpler questions and then I'm gonna let you get outta here. Question

364
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:53,645
Speaker 2:  number one is we got a bunch of questions about Apple News

365
00:23:53,755 --> 00:23:57,685
Speaker 2:  both in terms of like, should I read the website if I want

366
00:23:57,705 --> 00:24:01,525
Speaker 2:  to support The Verge is should I read and subscribe there or should I

367
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:05,365
Speaker 2:  read it in Apple News? Plus now that it's an Apple News Plus and

368
00:24:05,555 --> 00:24:08,525
Speaker 2:  just a bunch of people trying to figure out the sort of content mix. We used

369
00:24:08,525 --> 00:24:12,405
Speaker 2:  to have a lot of stuff in Apple News, now we're in Apple News Plus. What,

370
00:24:12,425 --> 00:24:15,725
Speaker 2:  how does that factor into kind of the broader subscription thinking here?

371
00:24:16,635 --> 00:24:20,085
Speaker 5:  I'll say the broader subscription thinking is that now we charge for The

372
00:24:20,245 --> 00:24:24,045
Speaker 5:  Verge, there is a VERGE subscription, which means we are giving less of The

373
00:24:24,165 --> 00:24:27,765
Speaker 5:  Verge away for free. And in particular we are giving less of The Verge

374
00:24:27,915 --> 00:24:31,085
Speaker 5:  away for free on other people's platforms. And so

375
00:24:32,005 --> 00:24:35,165
Speaker 5:  a great way to support The Verge is to Subscribe to The Verge and use our

376
00:24:35,165 --> 00:24:38,565
Speaker 5:  website, put a bookmark on your homepage, read us there.

377
00:24:38,745 --> 00:24:42,525
Speaker 5:  That's terrific. We are also participating in Apple News Plus,

378
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:47,005
Speaker 5:  so going forward in Apple News, you will need to be an Apple News Plus

379
00:24:47,325 --> 00:24:50,605
Speaker 5:  subscriber in order to read The Verge there. And I know there were some people,

380
00:24:50,745 --> 00:24:54,605
Speaker 5:  it sounds like actually more people than I thought who were loyal VERGE readers

381
00:24:54,605 --> 00:24:57,165
Speaker 5:  who were reading us for free in Apple News were really sad now.

382
00:24:57,165 --> 00:25:00,965
Speaker 2:  Same. I was very surprised by how many people noticed us being gone

383
00:25:00,965 --> 00:25:01,565
Speaker 2:  from Apple News.

384
00:25:01,915 --> 00:25:05,375
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I was actually surprised not because

385
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:09,295
Speaker 5:  there's not a ton of Apple News users who consume their news that way.

386
00:25:09,315 --> 00:25:12,575
Speaker 5:  That's totally a way people consume their news, but more that

387
00:25:13,155 --> 00:25:17,055
Speaker 5:  within Apple News people were like loyally

388
00:25:17,055 --> 00:25:20,735
Speaker 5:  following The Verge specifically. Yeah. Because it is more of an algorithmic

389
00:25:20,735 --> 00:25:24,575
Speaker 5:  news pla or I guess in their case it's more of an editor curated news experience

390
00:25:24,935 --> 00:25:28,055
Speaker 5:  where it's a bunch of different publications. So I think the surprising thing

391
00:25:28,055 --> 00:25:28,895
Speaker 5:  to me there is not

392
00:25:30,665 --> 00:25:33,725
Speaker 5:  was more like they're curating so many publications that there's people who

393
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:37,205
Speaker 5:  specifically care about The Verge for reading Apple News. But

394
00:25:37,835 --> 00:25:41,775
Speaker 5:  the reality is we are now charging on our website. I would hate to

395
00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:45,495
Speaker 5:  be charging people for something on our website and then giving it away for

396
00:25:45,495 --> 00:25:48,815
Speaker 5:  free somewhere else that would not feel also fair to the people who are paying

397
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:52,215
Speaker 5:  us on the website. And so for that reason, I would say

398
00:25:52,715 --> 00:25:55,655
Speaker 5:  two important ways you could support The Verge would be subscribing to The

399
00:25:55,735 --> 00:25:59,295
Speaker 5:  Verge or If you are an Apple News Plus subscriber or would like to consume

400
00:25:59,295 --> 00:26:02,135
Speaker 5:  your news that way, subscribe to Apple News Plus and then a Read a Bunch

401
00:26:02,135 --> 00:26:05,975
Speaker 5:  of VERGE content in Apple. And that also supports us and that's fine by me.

402
00:26:06,045 --> 00:26:06,335
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

403
00:26:06,335 --> 00:26:09,775
Speaker 2:  That's a, that's a, the that win-win I think is actually a useful thing because

404
00:26:10,015 --> 00:26:13,935
Speaker 2:  a thing we hear surprisingly frequently is people being like, I want to

405
00:26:13,935 --> 00:26:17,375
Speaker 2:  support The Verge. What is the best way to do that? And the thing I always

406
00:26:17,485 --> 00:26:21,175
Speaker 2:  have told people is come hang out on the website and now I feel like it's

407
00:26:21,175 --> 00:26:24,175
Speaker 2:  come hang out on the website and pay for the website. But also like If you

408
00:26:24,175 --> 00:26:27,735
Speaker 2:  are an Apple News Plus person and wanna stay that way, that's fine. That

409
00:26:27,735 --> 00:26:29,175
Speaker 2:  that works for us too. Yeah, that

410
00:26:29,175 --> 00:26:30,375
Speaker 5:  Supports us too. All right, that's

411
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:34,295
Speaker 2:  Good. All right, one more, this is a question from Tim

412
00:26:34,525 --> 00:26:37,015
Speaker 2:  that I'm just gonna read verbatim because I thought it was really interesting

413
00:26:37,015 --> 00:26:40,295
Speaker 2:  and I wanna know what you think Tim says. So you've often spoken about how

414
00:26:40,295 --> 00:26:43,765
Speaker 2:  adding a subscription model to something that is otherwise ad supported can

415
00:26:43,765 --> 00:26:47,365
Speaker 2:  change how ads are sold or what the value of them is. It changes the demographics

416
00:26:47,385 --> 00:26:50,725
Speaker 2:  of the free users in a way that reduces the value of the ads. And then

417
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:55,005
Speaker 2:  basically like what, what do we do with that now that The Verge has made

418
00:26:55,005 --> 00:26:57,685
Speaker 2:  the shift? Was that part of the thinking of making the shift?

419
00:26:58,155 --> 00:27:01,605
Speaker 5:  Well definitely, I mean I think you just heard me explain why we did a premium

420
00:27:01,785 --> 00:27:04,725
Speaker 5:  ad experience instead of ad free and it was for exactly this reason.

421
00:27:05,905 --> 00:27:09,685
Speaker 5:  If we were to take all of our content and make it totally

422
00:27:09,945 --> 00:27:13,725
Speaker 5:  ad free for VERGE subscribers, that weakens your advertising

423
00:27:14,005 --> 00:27:17,805
Speaker 5:  business both in terms of scale, like how much

424
00:27:18,325 --> 00:27:21,605
Speaker 5:  audience is there, how engaged that scale is.

425
00:27:22,345 --> 00:27:26,045
Speaker 5:  And then also I think advertisers perceive

426
00:27:26,315 --> 00:27:30,005
Speaker 5:  that someone who is paying for The Verge is someone

427
00:27:30,185 --> 00:27:33,845
Speaker 5:  who truly loves The Verge, truly cares about The Verge. And if an

428
00:27:34,045 --> 00:27:37,565
Speaker 5:  advertiser wants to work with The Verge, that's exactly the person they wanna

429
00:27:37,565 --> 00:27:41,205
Speaker 5:  most reach are like super fans. And so

430
00:27:41,905 --> 00:27:45,885
Speaker 5:  Tim is dead on that. The reason we did not do Ad Free is

431
00:27:45,885 --> 00:27:49,205
Speaker 5:  because we thought it would be too damaging to our advertising business,

432
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:52,525
Speaker 5:  which again will pay our bills for the next several years at least, in which

433
00:27:52,525 --> 00:27:56,125
Speaker 5:  I think can happily coexist. And so this is in the world of digital media

434
00:27:56,215 --> 00:27:59,885
Speaker 5:  where again, like success is like journalism continues to happen,

435
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:03,845
Speaker 5:  but you're seeing the same pressure play out on like

436
00:28:04,405 --> 00:28:08,245
Speaker 5:  platforms like Netflix, right? Netflix was ad free for a long time and

437
00:28:08,265 --> 00:28:11,645
Speaker 5:  has finally had to reckon with the fact that even as a subscription business,

438
00:28:12,075 --> 00:28:15,965
Speaker 5:  they're cheaper subscription tiers. They're not charging

439
00:28:15,965 --> 00:28:19,765
Speaker 5:  enough money to make up for the money they would make just doing ads.

440
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:24,285
Speaker 5:  And so there is definitely a fine balance If you put too many ads and you

441
00:28:24,325 --> 00:28:28,045
Speaker 5:  alienate people and they don't wanna consume your content, that's a bad

442
00:28:28,045 --> 00:28:30,965
Speaker 5:  experience and it's bad for the advertiser too. So

443
00:28:32,005 --> 00:28:35,485
Speaker 5:  I guess all of which is to say that's exactly why we're doing premium ad

444
00:28:35,485 --> 00:28:37,085
Speaker 5:  experience and non ad free. Okay,

445
00:28:37,155 --> 00:28:41,045
Speaker 2:  Fair enough. And then how did we land on the price? $7 a month, $50 a year?

446
00:28:41,575 --> 00:28:44,685
Speaker 2:  Where is that? Is that number art? Is it science? Where did that come from?

447
00:28:45,405 --> 00:28:49,385
Speaker 5:  Ooh, that's good. How did we land on price? So we wanted to be

448
00:28:49,385 --> 00:28:52,505
Speaker 5:  affordable enough that we thought a lot of people who Subscribe to The Verge

449
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:56,585
Speaker 5:  could pay for us. We did a survey last year to ask people like, would

450
00:28:56,585 --> 00:29:00,105
Speaker 5:  we be part of your kind of personal expenses or business expenses?

451
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:03,425
Speaker 5:  Hmm. And by and large what we heard is we would be part of people's personal

452
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:07,665
Speaker 5:  expenses. We didn't therefore want to charge hundreds and

453
00:29:07,665 --> 00:29:11,025
Speaker 5:  hundreds of dollars a year that we assumed people would be billing back to

454
00:29:11,185 --> 00:29:11,705
Speaker 5:  our workplace.

455
00:29:12,035 --> 00:29:14,745
Speaker 2:  Right? Which is like the Wall Street Journal money. Like that's a different

456
00:29:14,935 --> 00:29:18,825
Speaker 5:  Kind of expense D or the information or some of those

457
00:29:18,825 --> 00:29:21,985
Speaker 5:  competitors, right? I think I would assume a lot of those

458
00:29:22,585 --> 00:29:25,785
Speaker 5:  subscriptions are being billed back to the workplace. What we heard is people

459
00:29:25,785 --> 00:29:29,585
Speaker 5:  wanna Subscribe to The Verge because they personally love The Verge and it's

460
00:29:29,585 --> 00:29:33,505
Speaker 5:  part of not just their work utility, but it's also something that brings

461
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:37,465
Speaker 5:  them entertainment and joy. And so those are the people

462
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:41,045
Speaker 5:  we wanna reach with our subscription people who have a true

463
00:29:41,205 --> 00:29:44,085
Speaker 5:  relationship with The Verge people who make it part of their daily habit.

464
00:29:44,465 --> 00:29:48,045
Speaker 5:  And so we didn't wanna price too high that we would

465
00:29:48,345 --> 00:29:51,845
Speaker 5:  not be able to reach those people. And so we did a bunch of competitive research,

466
00:29:51,945 --> 00:29:55,765
Speaker 5:  we did a bunch of research on what it will cost us to like

467
00:29:55,825 --> 00:29:59,485
Speaker 5:  run this thing. We did a bunch of research on what is turning off all the

468
00:29:59,485 --> 00:30:02,525
Speaker 5:  ads that we turned off cost, right? And what do we need to cover there?

469
00:30:03,585 --> 00:30:07,125
Speaker 5:  And so we kind of put all of that together to arrive at the price.

470
00:30:07,865 --> 00:30:11,845
Speaker 5:  We did decide to charge significantly less if people subscribe annually than

471
00:30:11,845 --> 00:30:15,605
Speaker 5:  monthly. That's because I want a long-term relationship with people.

472
00:30:15,985 --> 00:30:19,805
Speaker 5:  Our annual subscription also right now comes with this incredibly cool

473
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:23,765
Speaker 5:  magazine content goblins that is deranged and perfect and wonderful. It's

474
00:30:23,765 --> 00:30:23,925
Speaker 2:  Fantastic.

475
00:30:24,075 --> 00:30:27,805
Speaker 5:  Yeah. As a former engagement editor who did marketing and SEO before

476
00:30:27,905 --> 00:30:29,045
Speaker 2:  You were a content goblin.

477
00:30:29,665 --> 00:30:29,885
Speaker 5:  Yes.

478
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:31,765
Speaker 2:  We've all done it at one point. It's okay.

479
00:30:31,765 --> 00:30:33,845
Speaker 5:  Well no, we're all still content goblins. That's true, David.

480
00:30:36,185 --> 00:30:39,765
Speaker 5:  But yeah, so we, we had to be expensive enough to cover our costs and make

481
00:30:39,765 --> 00:30:43,285
Speaker 5:  this a good business. But I wanted to be cheap enough and Neli and

482
00:30:43,725 --> 00:30:46,845
Speaker 5:  I think everyone wanted to be cheap enough that we thought people could afford

483
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,725
Speaker 5:  this as part of their daily entertainment, maybe more so

484
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:53,085
Speaker 5:  than an expensive subscription they bought through work. Fair

485
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:53,725
Speaker 2:  Enough. I like it.

486
00:30:53,765 --> 00:30:56,885
Speaker 5:  I don't know, it's, there's not actually like that many great places to hang

487
00:30:56,885 --> 00:30:59,845
Speaker 5:  out online anymore. I don't know if like this is part of the

488
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:04,685
Speaker 5:  canon of AI content that hits the web or how the social platforms are working.

489
00:31:04,715 --> 00:31:07,725
Speaker 5:  Like there just aren't that many fun places on the web anymore. I think The

490
00:31:07,885 --> 00:31:11,485
Speaker 5:  Verge fills that for a lot of people. I want it to fill that for a lot of

491
00:31:11,485 --> 00:31:15,325
Speaker 5:  people. Yeah. And so we wanted to price where it could be

492
00:31:15,325 --> 00:31:16,925
Speaker 5:  part of people's regular budget.

493
00:31:17,345 --> 00:31:21,005
Speaker 2:  And it is very fun to just be increasingly focused on

494
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:24,765
Speaker 2:  making The Verge dot com a fun place to hang out like that

495
00:31:24,985 --> 00:31:28,685
Speaker 2:  in addition to all of the like high-minded journalistic ideals. Like that's

496
00:31:28,685 --> 00:31:31,765
Speaker 2:  a really fun problem to try and solve is just make it a fun place to be.

497
00:31:32,065 --> 00:31:34,405
Speaker 2:  And that is like, that is a real goal we have. Yeah.

498
00:31:34,715 --> 00:31:38,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That was quick posts, right? That's what we wanted to do with the new

499
00:31:38,045 --> 00:31:41,925
Speaker 5:  website was create a homepage. That's so fun. You sit there

500
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:45,085
Speaker 5:  and you refresh it all day. Right? I mean David, I think you know this, but

501
00:31:45,165 --> 00:31:48,885
Speaker 5:  I joined The Verge because I was a super VERGE fan in my

502
00:31:48,915 --> 00:31:50,885
Speaker 5:  past life when I worked in marketing for

503
00:36:29,665 --> 00:36:33,205
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. So there's more business stuff to talk about and I

504
00:36:33,205 --> 00:36:37,085
Speaker 2:  suspect we will talk about some of it. But let's switch gears a bit

505
00:36:37,085 --> 00:36:40,605
Speaker 2:  and talk about how we make the things that we make and

506
00:36:40,945 --> 00:36:43,925
Speaker 2:  how we think about the world that we live in. And who better to do that with

507
00:36:44,355 --> 00:36:47,765
Speaker 2:  than your friend. My co-host, my boss

508
00:36:48,685 --> 00:36:51,965
Speaker 2:  Verges editor in chief Neela Patel. That sounded like a wrestling intro.

509
00:36:51,965 --> 00:36:55,005
Speaker 2:  That was pretty fun. We have a lot of questions for Neli. We're gonna spend

510
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:58,405
Speaker 2:  a bunch of time talking about all of this stuff. So let's just dive into

511
00:36:58,405 --> 00:37:02,165
Speaker 2:  it. Neli, hello. Hello. I just want you to know that Helen was here

512
00:37:02,165 --> 00:37:06,005
Speaker 2:  before you and she called herself the firewall. She was like, hi, I am

513
00:37:06,005 --> 00:37:09,445
Speaker 2:  Helen. I'm the firewall. And that's awesome. And that is what you have

514
00:37:09,865 --> 00:37:13,325
Speaker 2:  to live up to on this episode. You need a nickname that you give yourself.

515
00:37:13,595 --> 00:37:15,325
Speaker 2:  That is so good that I agree to it.

516
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:16,695
Speaker 7:  The fire.

517
00:37:17,715 --> 00:37:21,615
Speaker 2:  The fire. There we go. All right. That's pretty good. Okay, so we got, we

518
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:25,575
Speaker 2:  got a lot of questions around a couple of different themes. So I

519
00:37:25,575 --> 00:37:28,775
Speaker 2:  have tried to sort of break this up thematically, but you're gonna notice

520
00:37:28,795 --> 00:37:31,455
Speaker 2:  it just gets more random as it goes because we've just got a lot of questions.

521
00:37:31,455 --> 00:37:33,095
Speaker 2:  We're gonna answer as many of 'em as we can. By the way,

522
00:37:33,095 --> 00:37:35,335
Speaker 7:  Can I just agree with you that Helen is an incredibly hard act to follow?

523
00:37:36,115 --> 00:37:37,055
Speaker 2:  Oh God, yeah. So

524
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:40,015
Speaker 7:  There's a reason we made her, our boss. We're like, you should be in charge.

525
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:44,695
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's, it's very real. Okay. We have what

526
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:48,215
Speaker 2:  I would call like a, like a gentle controversy to start with, which I'm very

527
00:37:48,215 --> 00:37:52,135
Speaker 2:  excited about. So let me, let me, I'm gonna play you a question and then

528
00:37:52,135 --> 00:37:55,015
Speaker 2:  I'm gonna read you an email and I think they're, they're together. So we're

529
00:37:55,015 --> 00:37:55,375
Speaker 2:  gonna talk about them

530
00:37:55,535 --> 00:37:58,695
Speaker 7:  Together. If this isn't about whether or not theater at large of The Verge

531
00:37:58,695 --> 00:38:01,055
Speaker 7:  should have a shitty TV in good taste, I'm gonna be very disappointed.

532
00:38:01,635 --> 00:38:03,615
Speaker 2:  No, I think everyone's actually pretty kind on that one.

533
00:38:05,155 --> 00:38:08,495
Speaker 2:  I'm, I'm the outlier on that one, but, but that's okay. I'm good with it.

534
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:09,695
Speaker 2:  All right. Lemme just play this question for you.

535
00:38:11,275 --> 00:38:15,135
Speaker 8:  Hi, this is Jessica from Massachusetts. One of the things that I've always

536
00:38:15,135 --> 00:38:18,935
Speaker 8:  appreciated about The Verge was the wall that you put between the

537
00:38:18,935 --> 00:38:22,295
Speaker 8:  sales department and the newsroom. Now that you have

538
00:38:23,605 --> 00:38:27,375
Speaker 8:  lightning round sponsorship and now that the team is

539
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:31,215
Speaker 8:  aware of who the sponsors are, how are you going to maintain

540
00:38:31,215 --> 00:38:35,205
Speaker 8:  that journalistic integrity? Thanks so much. Love you guys, but

541
00:38:35,205 --> 00:38:35,885
Speaker 8:  listening for you.

542
00:38:37,095 --> 00:38:40,465
Speaker 2:  Okay, so we have that. And I'd also like to read you an email we got from

543
00:38:40,525 --> 00:38:40,745
Speaker 2:  Max,

544
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:42,335
Speaker 7:  My daughter,

545
00:38:42,555 --> 00:38:46,095
Speaker 2:  Not your daughter. Okay. But you never know Max, max does have thought the,

546
00:38:46,315 --> 00:38:47,895
Speaker 7:  The email is, why do I have to be quiet?

547
00:38:49,555 --> 00:38:52,535
Speaker 2:  Max writes, NELI has said multiple times that he keeps a firewall between

548
00:38:52,535 --> 00:38:55,375
Speaker 2:  the newsroom and the ad team. And it's been said that they would make money

549
00:38:55,395 --> 00:38:58,815
Speaker 2:  if the news people read the ads versus ad people. Neli goes as far as to

550
00:38:58,835 --> 00:39:02,135
Speaker 2:  not directly say the companies that are sponsoring the lightning round, but

551
00:39:02,345 --> 00:39:05,575
Speaker 2:  David does ad reads for The Vergecast. Liam, I know he's the producer, but

552
00:39:05,575 --> 00:39:08,295
Speaker 2:  he does appear as a voice from time to time. Also does them, what makes those

553
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:11,815
Speaker 2:  reads different or acceptable? Why can David do ad reads but Neli can't.

554
00:39:12,325 --> 00:39:14,335
Speaker 2:  Different questions, same thing,

555
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:17,195
Speaker 7:  Respond. Wait, no, I think they're different things. Are they?

556
00:39:17,265 --> 00:39:20,315
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Why do you think they're okay? Well then let's, let's pull them apart.

557
00:39:20,315 --> 00:39:21,235
Speaker 2:  Why do you think they're different things?

558
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:25,675
Speaker 7:  So we can look at our own website and see who our advertisers are all the

559
00:39:25,675 --> 00:39:29,395
Speaker 7:  time. That's a very normal thing. So knowing who the Lightning ad

560
00:39:29,395 --> 00:39:32,275
Speaker 7:  sponsors are to me is not any different than

561
00:39:32,985 --> 00:39:36,955
Speaker 7:  knowing whatever that, you know, whatever wireless carrier

562
00:39:37,015 --> 00:39:40,075
Speaker 7:  is buying ads on our site around iPhone time.

563
00:39:40,965 --> 00:39:43,775
Speaker 7:  It's been 13 years. I know the wireless carriers buy ads on our site around

564
00:39:43,775 --> 00:39:47,615
Speaker 7:  iPhone time. I think you can see that that doesn't really affect

565
00:39:47,615 --> 00:39:51,375
Speaker 7:  how we cover the wireless carriers, right? So knowing who the Lightning ad

566
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:55,015
Speaker 7:  sponsor is to me, is it, that's just all of a piece, right? It's,

567
00:39:55,155 --> 00:39:57,855
Speaker 7:  we can, we can see the product that we deliver to the audience

568
00:39:59,275 --> 00:40:03,215
Speaker 7:  and we just don't let that affect us. Like where they come, they go, the

569
00:40:03,215 --> 00:40:07,175
Speaker 7:  rule is the advertising team doesn't get to tell us what to

570
00:40:07,175 --> 00:40:11,135
Speaker 7:  do and we don't get to tell them what to do. Right. And

571
00:40:11,135 --> 00:40:14,975
Speaker 7:  that is very difficult. Like I, there are, there are ads

572
00:40:14,975 --> 00:40:17,095
Speaker 7:  on this show that I know people would prefer we didn't have.

573
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:21,685
Speaker 7:  But because the advertising team doesn't get to get to tell us what to do,

574
00:40:21,985 --> 00:40:25,365
Speaker 7:  our ability to, to open the door and start telling them what to do is

575
00:40:25,885 --> 00:40:29,485
Speaker 7:  challenging. 'cause then the door's open. Right now we're

576
00:40:29,485 --> 00:40:32,605
Speaker 7:  negotiating and I don't wanna have that negotiation. So that's just different

577
00:40:32,605 --> 00:40:36,005
Speaker 7:  to me. Right. It's, we're aware of what they're doing. 'cause we, at the

578
00:40:36,005 --> 00:40:39,525
Speaker 7:  end that we, we assemble the whole product and we put it out in the world

579
00:40:40,185 --> 00:40:42,805
Speaker 7:  and the lightning round is new. And it's funny and it's funny that the first

580
00:40:42,805 --> 00:40:46,765
Speaker 7:  sponsor was a big company, but we have ideas for that too. So I

581
00:40:46,775 --> 00:40:49,805
Speaker 7:  we're just gonna work that out. It's, it's new, but I think

582
00:40:50,705 --> 00:40:54,675
Speaker 7:  that is a familiar expression of the firewall. And the reason I was

583
00:40:54,675 --> 00:40:57,875
Speaker 7:  joking that I'm the fire is because the, the people that yell the most, the

584
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:00,115
Speaker 7:  yelling usually goes in one direction. It's me that way.

585
00:41:00,475 --> 00:41:03,435
Speaker 2:  I was gonna say, I think you spend a lot of time telling sales what to do.

586
00:41:03,435 --> 00:41:07,035
Speaker 2:  They're just not obligated to listen to you, I think is the

587
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:07,835
Speaker 2:  key difference,

588
00:41:07,925 --> 00:41:11,195
Speaker 7:  Right? My job is to protect the user experience of the website, right? Right.

589
00:41:11,215 --> 00:41:14,635
Speaker 7:  And so like, you can just look around at advertising supported websites and

590
00:41:14,635 --> 00:41:17,875
Speaker 7:  you can see the things that we have not done. And that is a lot of me and

591
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,115
Speaker 7:  Helen agreeing that we are not gonna do those things. And then I'm just the

592
00:41:20,115 --> 00:41:23,715
Speaker 7:  heavy, like I, I get to yell, right? She has to go run our business.

593
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:27,955
Speaker 7:  So that's that the, so does that have I adequately

594
00:41:27,955 --> 00:41:29,435
Speaker 7:  separated these two things? Yeah,

595
00:41:29,455 --> 00:41:32,555
Speaker 2:  No, I think that's fair. And I think the, the, the point that I was gonna

596
00:41:32,555 --> 00:41:35,045
Speaker 2:  make about the the firewalls is what you said. That it actually, it exists

597
00:41:35,045 --> 00:41:38,565
Speaker 2:  in both directions, which is that like they see the stuff that we make and

598
00:41:38,565 --> 00:41:42,325
Speaker 2:  we see the stuff that they sell, but neither side has any

599
00:41:42,355 --> 00:41:45,965
Speaker 2:  idea of what's going on. And like, we didn't know, I didn't know when I made

600
00:41:45,965 --> 00:41:49,685
Speaker 2:  the rundown for the show who was advertising in that show. So Right. It's

601
00:41:49,685 --> 00:41:52,965
Speaker 2:  like knowing who they are is I think less

602
00:41:52,965 --> 00:41:56,205
Speaker 2:  compromising than if we understood more of the process and how much money

603
00:41:56,225 --> 00:41:59,445
Speaker 2:  was involved and what was sold for when and to whom. Like that

604
00:42:00,325 --> 00:42:03,465
Speaker 2:  we stay away from very much on purpose. But like you're right, I can, I can

605
00:42:03,465 --> 00:42:06,065
Speaker 2:  look at our webpage and tell you who's advertising on it and I think by and

606
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,585
Speaker 2:  large that's mostly fine. Yeah.

607
00:42:07,585 --> 00:42:11,265
Speaker 7:  And I can pull that even farther back. We trade on a lot of old school

608
00:42:11,275 --> 00:42:14,385
Speaker 7:  journalism, right? We're built on a foundation that has been around for a

609
00:42:14,385 --> 00:42:17,505
Speaker 7:  long time. So when you were printing magazines,

610
00:42:18,405 --> 00:42:22,145
Speaker 7:  the advertising was printed in the magazine. Right? And

611
00:42:22,205 --> 00:42:26,065
Speaker 7:  you had to physically assemble that product and decide where the

612
00:42:26,065 --> 00:42:30,025
Speaker 7:  ads would go If, you know, I was a car and driver reader in the nineties

613
00:42:30,025 --> 00:42:33,305
Speaker 7:  in Wisconsin when I was a kid. And half of the letters the editor were like,

614
00:42:33,305 --> 00:42:36,665
Speaker 7:  why are there BMW ads are on the BM BMW review? You're biased. And like they

615
00:42:36,665 --> 00:42:39,865
Speaker 7:  would print the letters just so they could say, look, no, we're not. Whether

616
00:42:39,865 --> 00:42:42,385
Speaker 7:  or not you believe them in the nineties and Car and Driver, they did give

617
00:42:42,385 --> 00:42:46,225
Speaker 7:  a lot of good reviews to, to BMWs back then. But this is just like an

618
00:42:46,285 --> 00:42:49,665
Speaker 7:  old muscle, right? You have an editor in chief and you have a publisher and

619
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:54,145
Speaker 7:  we, Helen and I have a great relationship, but she's the business and I'm

620
00:42:54,145 --> 00:42:57,945
Speaker 7:  the newsroom and we're supposed to have a little bit of tension. Yeah.

621
00:42:57,965 --> 00:43:00,985
Speaker 7:  And that's good. Like that's, that's what we mean by the firewall is she

622
00:43:00,985 --> 00:43:04,025
Speaker 7:  has to go be, make us money. And I have to just spend the money. Great.

623
00:43:06,105 --> 00:43:08,825
Speaker 7:  I didn't know you were reading the ads and I'm just gonna tell you that you

624
00:43:08,825 --> 00:43:09,265
Speaker 7:  have to stop.

625
00:43:09,785 --> 00:43:13,625
Speaker 2:  I think I've read one ad this year. Okay. For whatever it's worth.

626
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:18,945
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Okay. So we should talk about this in two ways. One is just

627
00:43:18,945 --> 00:43:21,465
Speaker 2:  realistically, you are my boss and you get to tell me what to do. So like,

628
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:23,505
Speaker 2:  you, you win this fight. But

629
00:43:25,025 --> 00:43:28,905
Speaker 2:  I think as, as a, as a co-host of The Vergecast, I, I do wanna press

630
00:43:28,925 --> 00:43:31,545
Speaker 2:  on this slightly 'cause I think this is something I just have less religion

631
00:43:31,545 --> 00:43:35,225
Speaker 2:  about than you do on podcast ads in particular. Yes.

632
00:43:35,765 --> 00:43:39,705
Speaker 2:  And I just wanna poke at it, right? Like the, the line for me of

633
00:43:39,705 --> 00:43:43,545
Speaker 2:  like, we don't make branded content, right, is like so, so,

634
00:43:43,605 --> 00:43:47,545
Speaker 2:  so clear and so clean and so important to everything that we do, right?

635
00:43:47,565 --> 00:43:51,345
Speaker 2:  So like when, when years ago, like branded

636
00:43:51,345 --> 00:43:54,305
Speaker 2:  blog posts were like a huge business for Buzzfeed and it was a thing everybody

637
00:43:54,305 --> 00:43:56,905
Speaker 2:  was talking about. Like the the divide between those two things was always

638
00:43:56,905 --> 00:44:00,685
Speaker 2:  very clear to me. It's, that's

639
00:44:00,685 --> 00:44:04,485
Speaker 2:  less problematic for me in podcasts then. Like it's,

640
00:44:04,485 --> 00:44:08,365
Speaker 2:  it's not quite as stark for me there. Like you see a lot of podcast ads where

641
00:44:08,365 --> 00:44:10,965
Speaker 2:  one thing they really want is like personal experience, right? So you hear

642
00:44:10,965 --> 00:44:14,805
Speaker 2:  your podcast host talk about the product they got and why they like it. That's

643
00:44:14,805 --> 00:44:18,445
Speaker 2:  part of the ad. The advertiser pays more money for that and we just, resolutely

644
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:21,925
Speaker 2:  won't do that. We just don't do it. And

645
00:44:22,825 --> 00:44:26,685
Speaker 2:  the middle ground there where it's like the

646
00:44:26,685 --> 00:44:30,645
Speaker 2:  host who is obviously reading an ad reads an ad

647
00:44:31,425 --> 00:44:35,045
Speaker 2:  is just like a common part of the form of

648
00:44:35,125 --> 00:44:38,885
Speaker 2:  podcasts and frankly just makes me feel less

649
00:44:38,895 --> 00:44:42,725
Speaker 2:  gross than it would in some other forms. And I can't

650
00:44:42,725 --> 00:44:46,645
Speaker 2:  totally describe why, but that's where I'm at. Like, I

651
00:44:46,645 --> 00:44:50,565
Speaker 2:  think the, the advertiser I read an ad for is like, not somebody we

652
00:44:50,565 --> 00:44:53,725
Speaker 2:  would ever cover. I would never do it for somebody we would ever cover.

653
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:58,045
Speaker 2:  And yeah, I don't know. It felt okay and it always comes to me as like, here's

654
00:44:58,045 --> 00:45:01,005
Speaker 2:  a thing to do. I'm like, sure. And I just read it and it's over.

655
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:04,765
Speaker 7:  I would say one of the major challenges of having David work at your organization

656
00:45:04,825 --> 00:45:08,045
Speaker 7:  is David's like, yeah, I will do everything. And then you're like, wait,

657
00:45:08,245 --> 00:45:12,085
Speaker 7:  that rocket ship is gone. I have tore that and that's

658
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:14,325
Speaker 7:  very much the David Pierce experience and I love it. I have no complaints

659
00:45:14,325 --> 00:45:17,405
Speaker 7:  about that. But the, I think the,

660
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:22,265
Speaker 7:  I think I've just been radicalized over the past five to 10 to 13 years

661
00:45:22,285 --> 00:45:26,225
Speaker 7:  of running this place. Okay. I think that nuance is gone. I

662
00:45:26,225 --> 00:45:30,185
Speaker 7:  think it is dead. And I particularly think that

663
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:34,425
Speaker 7:  the new audience, the younger audience that came up in influencer world

664
00:45:34,975 --> 00:45:38,825
Speaker 7:  does not even know that there should be a firewall. Does not even know that

665
00:45:38,825 --> 00:45:42,585
Speaker 7:  we're trading on hundreds of years of traditional

666
00:45:42,595 --> 00:45:46,345
Speaker 7:  journalism editor, publisher dynamics. We're gonna print a

667
00:45:46,545 --> 00:45:49,985
Speaker 7:  magazine and the, the ads are gonna sit next to the reviews and there's a

668
00:45:49,985 --> 00:45:53,465
Speaker 7:  whole ecosystem and there's lots of crotchety old journalists who talk about

669
00:45:53,465 --> 00:45:56,945
Speaker 7:  the fights. Like they don't even know that existed. 'cause it's gone. Right?

670
00:45:57,435 --> 00:46:01,305
Speaker 7:  We're we're, we we're just rebuilding the ecosystem from scratch for better

671
00:46:01,305 --> 00:46:05,025
Speaker 7:  or worse. And most of the creators we compete with

672
00:46:05,415 --> 00:46:09,305
Speaker 7:  have decided that the, they, there's not a wall. The wall

673
00:46:09,305 --> 00:46:12,465
Speaker 7:  exists within themselves. Right. And they have to, and I think a lot of them

674
00:46:12,485 --> 00:46:15,745
Speaker 7:  do a good job of explaining where their lines are gonna be fine.

675
00:46:16,285 --> 00:46:19,745
Speaker 7:  Our line is just very different. And I think the second we make it more complicated

676
00:46:19,745 --> 00:46:23,705
Speaker 7:  where we lose, right? And so like we, us

677
00:46:23,705 --> 00:46:26,425
Speaker 7:  saying, well, you know, we have a list of approved advertisers that we'll

678
00:46:26,425 --> 00:46:30,385
Speaker 7:  do host reads for, but we won't do personal, like in

679
00:46:30,385 --> 00:46:34,345
Speaker 7:  the broad ecosystem of stuff. Like I think that message

680
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:38,145
Speaker 7:  just gets lost, right? And the idea that you can pay us to say

681
00:46:38,145 --> 00:46:41,725
Speaker 7:  stuff is the only message it comes through. So that's why I've been like

682
00:46:41,725 --> 00:46:45,485
Speaker 7:  very over the years, like I used to read some of the ads and I thought it

683
00:46:45,485 --> 00:46:48,685
Speaker 7:  was funny when we restarted the End Gadget podcast, we had no ads. 'cause

684
00:46:48,685 --> 00:46:52,645
Speaker 7:  who was gonna buy our show with me and Josh and Paul just like

685
00:46:52,645 --> 00:46:56,085
Speaker 7:  start like restarting this old podcast. It was sitting around and when we

686
00:46:56,085 --> 00:46:59,645
Speaker 7:  got our first ads, we were like thrilled, right? Because it was like validating.

687
00:46:59,745 --> 00:47:03,365
Speaker 7:  And I can see a bunch of creators feel the

688
00:47:03,365 --> 00:47:04,565
Speaker 7:  validation of, oh, an

689
00:47:04,765 --> 00:47:07,205
Speaker 2:  Advertiser. Oh yeah. The first Brandand deal is a moment as a creator.

690
00:47:07,205 --> 00:47:10,885
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Right? And I, I'm totally sympathetic to that. So like,

691
00:47:10,915 --> 00:47:14,485
Speaker 7:  I've had all the experiences. I just think now at this point when

692
00:47:15,675 --> 00:47:19,495
Speaker 7:  we are rebuilding this ecosystem from scratch for an audience that has no

693
00:47:19,735 --> 00:47:23,655
Speaker 7:  familiarity with it, where the, the instinct and the expectation

694
00:47:23,955 --> 00:47:27,575
Speaker 7:  is you can pay people to say things on social platforms.

695
00:47:28,415 --> 00:47:31,805
Speaker 7:  I think we just have to be harsher about it. And fundamentally what what

696
00:47:31,805 --> 00:47:35,045
Speaker 7:  we're selling with our subscription is like, this is, this is the thing that

697
00:47:35,045 --> 00:47:38,725
Speaker 7:  keeps us from having to do that to keep the lights on. And maybe that's too

698
00:47:38,725 --> 00:47:42,545
Speaker 7:  harsh. I, I think, I think at the end of the day, like the

699
00:47:42,665 --> 00:47:46,425
Speaker 7:  internet destroys nuance and I'm, I'm just, I'm willing to be a little

700
00:47:47,335 --> 00:47:50,985
Speaker 7:  harsher to preserve the clarity of our message around how the

701
00:47:50,985 --> 00:47:54,105
Speaker 7:  journalism is made than maybe I was a few years ago. Right? Like,

702
00:47:55,145 --> 00:47:58,245
Speaker 7:  that's fine. Like Josh once gave away a car out on The Verge and like, and

703
00:47:58,245 --> 00:48:01,365
Speaker 7:  he was like in the back of a Ford, like giving away a car. Like we've, we've

704
00:48:01,365 --> 00:48:04,605
Speaker 7:  done all the things and we've had all the experiences and I, I think what

705
00:48:04,865 --> 00:48:08,845
Speaker 7:  the thing that I'm just really settled on

706
00:48:09,265 --> 00:48:12,915
Speaker 7:  is it's too hard to convey the nuance. We just end up

707
00:48:12,915 --> 00:48:15,395
Speaker 7:  over-communicating what the advertising and why the advertising didn't affect

708
00:48:15,395 --> 00:48:19,155
Speaker 7:  us than about the journalism. And I would rather just spend our time

709
00:48:19,155 --> 00:48:20,075
Speaker 7:  focused on the journalism.

710
00:48:20,335 --> 00:48:23,955
Speaker 2:  That's fair. I mean, I feel like that argument is the same one for

711
00:48:24,455 --> 00:48:28,435
Speaker 2:  why you won't shut up about this on our site and on the podcast

712
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:32,435
Speaker 2:  and wherever and why we're doing this episode. Right? Like I think a a thing

713
00:48:32,515 --> 00:48:36,235
Speaker 2:  I have realized over time is that like you're,

714
00:48:36,575 --> 00:48:40,515
Speaker 2:  you, you, we are doing this as a publication sort of performatively and

715
00:48:40,515 --> 00:48:44,435
Speaker 2:  it's on purpose, right? Like it is, we, we are making more out of this than

716
00:48:44,435 --> 00:48:48,355
Speaker 2:  we need to because that is the, the tide is pulling the

717
00:48:48,355 --> 00:48:48,715
Speaker 2:  other way.

718
00:48:49,265 --> 00:48:52,395
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And look, these are very traditional standards we were talking about,

719
00:48:52,445 --> 00:48:56,275
Speaker 7:  right? We have peers and friends at traditional

720
00:48:56,275 --> 00:48:58,355
Speaker 7:  newsrooms who are like, why do you guys talk about this so much? This is

721
00:48:58,355 --> 00:48:59,435
Speaker 7:  just how it works. This

722
00:48:59,435 --> 00:49:01,715
Speaker 2:  Is what I mean. Like, we came up with an ethics policy and you were like,

723
00:49:01,715 --> 00:49:04,195
Speaker 2:  I have done ethics. And I was like, no, other people have had ethics

724
00:49:04,195 --> 00:49:07,835
Speaker 7:  Policy. Yeah. And our ethics policy, to be a hundred percent honest, was

725
00:49:07,835 --> 00:49:11,235
Speaker 7:  totally stolen from Walt Mossberg at the Wall Street Journal, right? Like

726
00:49:11,235 --> 00:49:14,475
Speaker 7:  we just boosted theirs and that we've, you know, slowly iterated on it over

727
00:49:14,475 --> 00:49:18,315
Speaker 7:  the years. This is old stuff, but I think the failure of

728
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:22,315
Speaker 7:  the journalism industry, not the media industry, the journalism

729
00:49:22,595 --> 00:49:25,795
Speaker 7:  industry is not communicating how the information is made.

730
00:49:27,045 --> 00:49:30,435
Speaker 7:  Every other industry is like, look at how cool it is that we made this thing.

731
00:49:30,855 --> 00:49:34,195
Speaker 7:  You wanna watch a Dorito get made, there's infinity content that's like,

732
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:38,235
Speaker 7:  watch this corn turn into a Dorito. And you're like, wow,

733
00:49:38,235 --> 00:49:41,755
Speaker 7:  that's really cool. You wanna watch how journalism gets made? No one ever

734
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:44,515
Speaker 7:  talks about it. They're just like, here's the story where the New York Times

735
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:48,075
Speaker 7:  don't question us. And I, I think in this ecosystem,

736
00:49:48,745 --> 00:49:52,035
Speaker 7:  when so many creators on social platforms are so powerful and so influential,

737
00:49:52,575 --> 00:49:55,395
Speaker 7:  and they talk about how they make this stuff all the time, we can play a

738
00:49:55,395 --> 00:49:58,315
Speaker 7:  little bit of that game. And all we're really saying is we're doing this

739
00:49:58,415 --> 00:50:02,235
Speaker 7:  the old fashioned way, right? Like, we are just gonna remain

740
00:50:02,235 --> 00:50:06,115
Speaker 7:  independent. We have new competitors who have substantially the same

741
00:50:06,115 --> 00:50:09,155
Speaker 7:  policy as us, four or four media substantially the same policies as us, right?

742
00:50:09,455 --> 00:50:13,195
Speaker 7:  I'm not saying this is totally unexpected. I, I think the

743
00:50:13,195 --> 00:50:17,075
Speaker 7:  piece of it that's new is we have to communicate about it very loudly.

744
00:50:17,495 --> 00:50:19,995
Speaker 7:  And I think this is the part we can argue about. We have to draw much harsher

745
00:50:20,005 --> 00:50:23,155
Speaker 7:  lines to make the message simple enough for the modern internet.

746
00:50:23,815 --> 00:50:26,355
Speaker 2:  And that's just that. Yeah, I think that's fair. I mean, and I think, I think

747
00:50:26,355 --> 00:50:29,345
Speaker 2:  we, we ultimately land in not that different places, right? Which is that

748
00:50:29,345 --> 00:50:30,585
Speaker 2:  like, in a vacuum,

749
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:36,045
Speaker 2:  this is a sliding scale, but we're just, we and you in particular are just

750
00:50:36,165 --> 00:50:38,805
Speaker 2:  choosing not to treat this as a sliding scale because like, I'm just going

751
00:50:38,805 --> 00:50:42,005
Speaker 2:  to live all the way at the top because it, it is a slippery and hard to explain

752
00:50:42,055 --> 00:50:45,965
Speaker 2:  slope as soon as you start going down it. And that's fine. I buy that

753
00:50:45,965 --> 00:50:49,685
Speaker 2:  logic. It is, I I would say there are probably people who work at

754
00:50:49,745 --> 00:50:51,725
Speaker 2:  Vox Media who wish you would be a little less,

755
00:50:52,305 --> 00:50:54,725
Speaker 7:  We would militant so much money if I read the ads, I just wanna be

756
00:50:54,725 --> 00:50:55,325
Speaker 2:  There. It's like that.

757
00:50:55,645 --> 00:50:57,805
Speaker 7:  I don't wanna, I don't, that's my point. I'm not gonna shade this. We would

758
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:01,085
Speaker 7:  make a ton of money if we read the ads. And actually another weird piece

759
00:51:01,085 --> 00:51:04,685
Speaker 7:  of our structure and being a media company and making

760
00:51:04,685 --> 00:51:07,485
Speaker 7:  traditional journalism is that if David and I were just creators,

761
00:51:08,235 --> 00:51:11,485
Speaker 7:  literally we would make the money if we read the ads, yes.

762
00:51:12,295 --> 00:51:16,025
Speaker 7:  Like individually, we would just cash the checks and then, you know,

763
00:51:16,285 --> 00:51:19,865
Speaker 7:  buy, buy cars. Like that's what I would do. I dunno, David too,

764
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:21,785
Speaker 7:  I'd make David buy an ed team.

765
00:51:23,565 --> 00:51:26,785
Speaker 7:  We don't do that. We, when a company cashes the checks and then we use it

766
00:51:26,785 --> 00:51:30,425
Speaker 7:  to pay for our newsroom, right? And we've got this huge newsroom

767
00:51:30,425 --> 00:51:34,065
Speaker 7:  behind us that does most of the work that we just talk about in the show.

768
00:51:34,085 --> 00:51:37,625
Speaker 7:  And I like that. I want to keep making journalism jobs. I,

769
00:51:38,065 --> 00:51:40,825
Speaker 7:  I want to keep hiring 22 year olds who have no idea what they're doing and

770
00:51:40,825 --> 00:51:43,465
Speaker 7:  watch them graduate and go to senior positions and start their own things

771
00:51:43,465 --> 00:51:46,905
Speaker 7:  in the future. We've done a lot of that over 13 years, and that's just because

772
00:51:46,905 --> 00:51:49,665
Speaker 7:  of the revenue. So yeah, we could make a lot more money.

773
00:51:50,805 --> 00:51:54,025
Speaker 7:  We wouldn't make it as individuals. Maybe we could fund our newsroom, but

774
00:51:54,145 --> 00:51:57,905
Speaker 7:  I think we would, we would end up destroying the core value of the newsroom.

775
00:51:57,965 --> 00:52:01,745
Speaker 7:  And you can see many of our competitors that have made those kinds of deals

776
00:52:01,765 --> 00:52:05,305
Speaker 7:  or made those kinds of trade offs do not exist anymore. Right. Because

777
00:52:05,545 --> 00:52:07,745
Speaker 7:  ultimately the only thing you're really selling is your credibility. And

778
00:52:07,745 --> 00:52:08,865
Speaker 7:  once you let that go, it's gone.

779
00:52:09,235 --> 00:52:13,105
Speaker 2:  Right? And there's a, I mean, like, you, you can draw a a straight line

780
00:52:13,105 --> 00:52:15,985
Speaker 2:  from the end of that sentence too, and this is why we did this subscription,

781
00:52:15,985 --> 00:52:19,625
Speaker 2:  right? Like, it is, it just, it it aligns all of that stuff

782
00:52:19,695 --> 00:52:23,545
Speaker 2:  much more cleanly when the people who consume our

783
00:52:23,545 --> 00:52:26,385
Speaker 2:  stuff are the ones who pay for that stuff. There's just no

784
00:52:27,055 --> 00:52:30,945
Speaker 2:  weirdness in that circle in a way that is really, really clarifying and

785
00:52:30,945 --> 00:52:31,105
Speaker 2:  helpful.

786
00:52:31,775 --> 00:52:35,705
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I think, I think it's challenging and like I said, we would

787
00:52:35,705 --> 00:52:39,385
Speaker 7:  make a lot more money if I read the ads. Like it's not lost on me. And

788
00:52:39,565 --> 00:52:43,225
Speaker 7:  it is, Helen is one side of the firewall and I'm the other, and I'm the one

789
00:52:43,225 --> 00:52:47,155
Speaker 7:  who says, we're not gonna make that money. That it, that money is, that money

790
00:52:47,175 --> 00:52:51,035
Speaker 7:  is too expensive. Yeah. Right. Is like a, a way that I think about it. It's,

791
00:52:51,095 --> 00:52:54,435
Speaker 7:  it costs too much to make this money. We will not make more money in the

792
00:52:54,435 --> 00:52:57,435
Speaker 7:  future. We'll just make it in the beginning and then we'll be, now we'll

793
00:52:57,435 --> 00:53:00,035
Speaker 7:  be competing against people who will do even worse things that we will not

794
00:53:00,035 --> 00:53:03,595
Speaker 7:  do, and I don't wanna compete with them. And the good news w

795
00:53:03,705 --> 00:53:07,595
Speaker 7:  weirdly, is that the more we stay harsh, the more

796
00:53:07,595 --> 00:53:11,315
Speaker 7:  we are differentiated, the more stable the demand remains. Right? People

797
00:53:11,315 --> 00:53:15,195
Speaker 7:  want to buy advertising on our site because big brands

798
00:53:15,195 --> 00:53:17,595
Speaker 7:  want to buy advertising on our site because they know they can't buy us,

799
00:53:18,475 --> 00:53:22,385
Speaker 7:  which is weird. That's just a weird outcome in the right, in the media

800
00:53:22,385 --> 00:53:25,685
Speaker 7:  ecosystem. Lots of CEOs wanna come on decoder all the time

801
00:53:25,995 --> 00:53:29,925
Speaker 7:  because they, they know they can't tell me to do. And like,

802
00:53:30,205 --> 00:53:33,605
Speaker 7:  I think a lot of them want to prove to their teams that they can take the

803
00:53:33,605 --> 00:53:37,445
Speaker 7:  heat. Weird. That's just a weird, it's counterintuitive notion

804
00:53:37,445 --> 00:53:40,885
Speaker 7:  in a world where a bunch of, you know, like Casey

805
00:53:41,065 --> 00:53:44,605
Speaker 7:  Newton is always joking with me that the podcast ecosystem is like, you can

806
00:53:44,605 --> 00:53:46,885
Speaker 7:  pick two names out of a hat and they've interviewed each other on a podcast

807
00:53:48,665 --> 00:53:52,525
Speaker 7:  And there's like rules and like a lot of them are programmed and like whatever,

808
00:53:52,575 --> 00:53:55,845
Speaker 7:  right? A lot of it is branded content is bought and paid for and we're not.

809
00:53:55,905 --> 00:53:59,165
Speaker 7:  And because we're so loud about it, we have a long list of incoming,

810
00:54:00,095 --> 00:54:03,085
Speaker 7:  we're we're not lacking for people who wanna show up and, and, and talk on

811
00:54:03,085 --> 00:54:06,965
Speaker 7:  our show. So I, there's greater value there over the long term. And

812
00:54:06,965 --> 00:54:09,765
Speaker 7:  being focused on that long term is really hard. And I mean, it's ecosystem

813
00:54:09,765 --> 00:54:13,685
Speaker 7:  that quite frankly is like dying by the day. Yeah. So that's where

814
00:54:13,685 --> 00:54:15,925
Speaker 7:  part of subscriptions come in is like, how do we make something healthy and

815
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:18,725
Speaker 7:  resilient? How do we diversify revenue? And then how do we make sure that

816
00:54:18,725 --> 00:54:21,885
Speaker 7:  we're still selling the thing that we're selling, which is independence.

817
00:54:22,585 --> 00:54:23,325
Speaker 2:  All right. That's good.

818
00:54:23,425 --> 00:54:26,485
Speaker 7:  All right. Wait, can I, we we have to address why Liam gets to read the ads?

819
00:54:26,865 --> 00:54:29,645
Speaker 2:  Oh yeah, sure. Okay. Well here, let me, let me play the next question. Yeah.

820
00:54:29,645 --> 00:54:31,285
Speaker 2:  Which I think is a, is a good way to get into this.

821
00:54:32,705 --> 00:54:36,445
Speaker 9:  Hi, Jolene Joseph here calling from my closet. So I just wanna do a David

822
00:54:37,695 --> 00:54:41,365
Speaker 9:  intro there. Yeah. I'm just curious actually about how

823
00:54:41,785 --> 00:54:45,405
Speaker 9:  you decide to do ads on the show in particular.

824
00:54:46,255 --> 00:54:49,445
Speaker 9:  Y'all talked about this a little bit, but I'm really curious on how you make

825
00:54:49,445 --> 00:54:53,165
Speaker 9:  the decision on who reads those ads. I remember at some point

826
00:54:53,355 --> 00:54:56,645
Speaker 9:  Neli was reading some HubSpot ads.

827
00:54:57,165 --> 00:55:01,005
Speaker 9:  This was at least, I wanna say a few years ago. I don't forget

828
00:55:01,005 --> 00:55:04,685
Speaker 9:  because I used to work at Salesforce. But yeah, I'm just curious

829
00:55:05,145 --> 00:55:08,765
Speaker 9:  how you make that decision on who is gonna read the ads, whether or not

830
00:55:09,085 --> 00:55:12,485
Speaker 9:  somebody who is actually a host of the show versus

831
00:55:13,085 --> 00:55:16,725
Speaker 9:  producer versus somebody else. It seems like there was a change at some point

832
00:55:16,835 --> 00:55:20,805
Speaker 9:  made perhaps to give a little bit more distance. I noticed other

833
00:55:20,805 --> 00:55:24,005
Speaker 9:  shows do this differently. I've been thinking about a bit as I start to do

834
00:55:24,005 --> 00:55:27,765
Speaker 9:  some consulting myself and thinking about paid partnerships and

835
00:55:27,765 --> 00:55:30,365
Speaker 9:  what that actually looks like. And yeah, I just love to get a little bit

836
00:55:30,365 --> 00:55:32,005
Speaker 9:  more insight on how you make those decisions.

837
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:37,055
Speaker 2:  So there you go. You knew the frame of the question. I just wanna get more

838
00:55:37,055 --> 00:55:38,615
Speaker 2:  people's voices onto the show. I

839
00:55:38,615 --> 00:55:39,855
Speaker 7:  Do like the fake David intro.

840
00:55:41,425 --> 00:55:43,855
Speaker 2:  You'd be alarmed at how often I'm in my closet recording

841
00:55:43,855 --> 00:55:46,455
Speaker 7:  Face. Yeah, you'd be alarmed at how often David is faking the intro. He is

842
00:55:46,455 --> 00:55:49,175
Speaker 7:  like, I'm riding a horse. He is like doing the coconuts in the closet. How

843
00:55:49,175 --> 00:55:50,935
Speaker 2:  Dare you. How dare you.

844
00:55:53,165 --> 00:55:56,535
Speaker 7:  This is the inside baseball man. That's something people want. David has

845
00:55:56,535 --> 00:55:57,775
Speaker 7:  so many coconuts in his closet,

846
00:55:59,195 --> 00:56:00,575
Speaker 2:  So yeah. Why, why Liam?

847
00:56:01,155 --> 00:56:04,575
Speaker 7:  So the, the, the reality of we would make a lot more money if we read the

848
00:56:04,575 --> 00:56:07,795
Speaker 7:  ads is real, right? And that is just demand in the market that what they

849
00:56:07,795 --> 00:56:10,315
Speaker 7:  want is social reads. What they want is what David is talking about, what

850
00:56:10,475 --> 00:56:13,995
Speaker 7:  personal experience they're trying to trade on. The trust you have with the

851
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:17,735
Speaker 7:  voices you're hearing that's advertising that

852
00:56:17,795 --> 00:56:20,735
Speaker 7:  is just fundamentally how advertising works. They're like, you trust this

853
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:24,635
Speaker 7:  person now they will sell you a cell phone in that If you

854
00:56:24,635 --> 00:56:28,515
Speaker 7:  watch television advertising, you're like a random SNL celebrity selling

855
00:56:28,515 --> 00:56:32,435
Speaker 7:  you Verizon. That's just a thing that is happening left and right. So that's

856
00:56:32,435 --> 00:56:35,595
Speaker 7:  like the foundation of advertising. And I honestly, I have no

857
00:56:36,405 --> 00:56:40,215
Speaker 7:  like, moral complaints about that. That's how that industry works. And it's

858
00:56:40,215 --> 00:56:43,015
Speaker 7:  worked for a long time and I think people understand it. Where I think it

859
00:56:43,015 --> 00:56:46,375
Speaker 7:  gets dicey is we as journalists should not be endorsing things, especially

860
00:56:46,375 --> 00:56:50,355
Speaker 7:  as product reviewers. And there's other categories where it maybe it makes,

861
00:56:50,355 --> 00:56:53,515
Speaker 7:  makes sense, but we do so much product reviewing and we should not be anywhere

862
00:56:53,515 --> 00:56:56,435
Speaker 7:  near products at the same time, we know the demand in the market is there.

863
00:56:57,175 --> 00:57:01,075
Speaker 7:  So our solution here is that Liam is a character on our show. He is a

864
00:57:01,275 --> 00:57:05,195
Speaker 7:  familiar voice, but he is just the producer of the show. He's not

865
00:57:05,195 --> 00:57:07,755
Speaker 7:  writing product reviews for the site. He doesn't have editorial control over

866
00:57:07,755 --> 00:57:11,235
Speaker 7:  his show, which I have a lot of sympathy for Liam being the producer of the

867
00:57:11,235 --> 00:57:14,715
Speaker 7:  show that the editor in chief hosts real pain in the ass. Yeah.

868
00:57:15,505 --> 00:57:18,395
Speaker 7:  Huge, huge pain in the ass. So

869
00:57:19,515 --> 00:57:23,195
Speaker 7:  just insulated enough. And then the rule is Liam doesn't get to do anything

870
00:57:23,195 --> 00:57:27,035
Speaker 7:  except read the copy that is delivered to him. So there's not

871
00:57:27,145 --> 00:57:30,915
Speaker 7:  even that back and forth weirdness. We think that's a

872
00:57:30,915 --> 00:57:34,635
Speaker 7:  good solution, right? We think it matches with the experience

873
00:57:34,635 --> 00:57:37,275
Speaker 7:  everybody else has on other podcast, which is like, here's a familiar voice

874
00:57:37,315 --> 00:57:39,715
Speaker 7:  reading this thing. It's not our voices.

875
00:57:41,145 --> 00:57:44,455
Speaker 7:  Right? So we, we solved that problem and, and maybe we've gotten it wrong.

876
00:57:44,515 --> 00:57:48,375
Speaker 7:  You you should tell us, but it it, it creates enough of

877
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:52,055
Speaker 7:  the same product where our sales team can go into the market and compete

878
00:57:52,685 --> 00:57:56,495
Speaker 7:  without causing all of the downstream problems because it's not us.

879
00:57:57,155 --> 00:58:00,835
Speaker 7:  And like, in a very real way, it's not us. I'm open to the

880
00:58:01,075 --> 00:58:04,475
Speaker 7:  feedback, but I, I think there's enough division there where I'm not, the

881
00:58:04,475 --> 00:58:07,795
Speaker 7:  nuance isn't being crushed or I'm not relying on the nuance. Like it's a

882
00:58:07,795 --> 00:58:11,555
Speaker 7:  different person. I would say my dream for the longest time

883
00:58:11,615 --> 00:58:14,835
Speaker 7:  has been to bring back the hype desk and have an on staff influencer who

884
00:58:14,835 --> 00:58:18,395
Speaker 7:  just lives on the hype desk. Yep. This is the loneliest job in America.

885
00:58:18,915 --> 00:58:22,715
Speaker 7:  You get to be part of The Verge, but not in the newsroom. And your job

886
00:58:22,735 --> 00:58:26,475
Speaker 7:  is to just do branded content and never talk to anyone in the newsroom.

887
00:58:26,955 --> 00:58:29,675
Speaker 7:  'cause you have to maintain the wall. You can see why no one has signed up

888
00:58:29,675 --> 00:58:30,395
Speaker 7:  for this. It's coolest this job.

889
00:58:30,505 --> 00:58:30,795
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

890
00:58:31,225 --> 00:58:35,035
Speaker 7:  Like be alone, be the thing you can buy in The Verge that it's totally isolated

891
00:58:35,035 --> 00:58:38,995
Speaker 7:  from everyone else. Does not seem like a great job, but it's one

892
00:58:38,995 --> 00:58:42,275
Speaker 7:  of the other ways we've, we've thought about the solution here. I don't know

893
00:58:42,275 --> 00:58:45,475
Speaker 7:  if that's ever gonna happen, but it's, I'm, I'm, we're trying to find ways

894
00:58:45,475 --> 00:58:48,795
Speaker 7:  to be competitive in the market and still preserve

895
00:58:49,455 --> 00:58:52,995
Speaker 7:  the, the credibility that is the fundamentally the thing we're selling. But

896
00:58:52,995 --> 00:58:55,195
Speaker 7:  Liam's here, Liam, do you have anything to add to this? Yeah,

897
00:58:55,235 --> 00:58:58,755
Speaker 3:  I would just say I get ad requests on a regular basis. It's not something

898
00:58:58,755 --> 00:59:02,555
Speaker 3:  I communicate to Neli or David at all. They have no idea

899
00:59:02,555 --> 00:59:06,155
Speaker 3:  what ads I've read that week and what get included in the show. So that's

900
00:59:06,155 --> 00:59:08,115
Speaker 3:  one of the ways we create that boundary.

901
00:59:08,985 --> 00:59:09,275
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

902
00:59:09,355 --> 00:59:12,475
Speaker 2:  I do enjoy the emails I get every week from people complaining about one

903
00:59:12,475 --> 00:59:15,315
Speaker 2:  ad or another. And that's how I find out who advertises on our show most

904
00:59:15,315 --> 00:59:16,675
Speaker 2:  of the time is from people who are mad

905
00:59:16,675 --> 00:59:19,475
Speaker 7:  About it. So those emails are really interesting. I I think they're, they're

906
00:59:19,475 --> 00:59:22,085
Speaker 7:  proof that people can't tell the difference,

907
00:59:23,165 --> 00:59:26,995
Speaker 7:  right? That, that it's all one experience. And mostly our

908
00:59:26,995 --> 00:59:30,755
Speaker 7:  competitors take responsibility for the whole experience. Yeah,

909
00:59:30,755 --> 00:59:31,115
Speaker 2:  That's fair.

910
00:59:31,135 --> 00:59:35,035
Speaker 7:  And we, we just don't, and like that's, I think that's weird. I think it's

911
00:59:35,035 --> 00:59:38,875
Speaker 7:  dissonant for a lot of people, but I fundamentally, I I

912
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:42,555
Speaker 7:  don't know If you can keep them

913
00:59:42,795 --> 00:59:45,795
Speaker 7:  separate while you're taking the junkets and while you're accepting the brand

914
00:59:45,795 --> 00:59:49,555
Speaker 7:  deals and negotiating their rates. I maybe some creators can, again,

915
00:59:49,555 --> 00:59:53,395
Speaker 7:  there's lots of them who have really laid out exactly what they will and

916
00:59:53,395 --> 00:59:56,395
Speaker 7:  want to. Michael Fisher, Mr. Mobile has been very complimentary of our ethics

917
00:59:56,395 --> 00:59:59,435
Speaker 7:  policy over the years. He has done an excellent job of laying out what he

918
00:59:59,435 --> 01:00:03,265
Speaker 7:  will and won't do and how it will work for him, but he still takes the money.

919
01:00:03,315 --> 01:00:06,505
Speaker 7:  Right. And like, you've gotta trust him. I think a lot of people do. I think

920
01:00:06,505 --> 01:00:09,905
Speaker 7:  they, I I I think that's a reasonable position to take. Like he's laid it

921
01:00:09,905 --> 01:00:13,865
Speaker 7:  out. He's been explicit, he's very clear. That's not every creator. And I

922
01:00:13,865 --> 01:00:17,805
Speaker 7:  think that's too hard for us at scale. I can't run a whole

923
01:00:17,805 --> 01:00:21,485
Speaker 7:  newsroom being like, I've made up some rules. Like it has to be simple and

924
01:00:21,485 --> 01:00:22,565
Speaker 7:  it has to be simple for the audience.

925
01:00:22,955 --> 01:00:26,885
Speaker 2:  Yeah. All right. We have a few more quicker ones that are less about

926
01:00:27,015 --> 01:00:30,645
Speaker 2:  Eli's feelings about ads. Let's just plow through these before we get to

927
01:00:30,645 --> 01:00:33,605
Speaker 2:  take a break. Let me, let me play you a couple. This I think might have been

928
01:00:33,605 --> 01:00:35,245
Speaker 2:  my favorite question we got this entire time.

929
01:00:36,385 --> 01:00:40,165
Speaker 10:  Hey, this casters, I've been listening to your podcast for forever, and

930
01:00:40,195 --> 01:00:44,085
Speaker 10:  I've always wondered what exactly happens during ad breaks. Do you like

931
01:00:44,195 --> 01:00:48,005
Speaker 10:  chat for five minutes and then return, or do you resume recording

932
01:00:48,005 --> 01:00:49,395
Speaker 10:  immediately? Thanks.

933
01:00:50,265 --> 01:00:51,325
Speaker 2:  Do people wanna know Neli?

934
01:00:51,385 --> 01:00:54,365
Speaker 7:  I'm so sad about this. This is a real,

935
01:00:55,475 --> 01:00:59,305
Speaker 7:  we're gonna destroy your suspension of disbelief. I'm really sorry

936
01:00:59,305 --> 01:01:01,865
Speaker 7:  about this. Like, I, I don't wanna tell you,

937
01:01:03,645 --> 01:01:07,465
Speaker 7:  we don't know. We just say, okay, we gotta stop and then we hit a

938
01:01:07,465 --> 01:01:10,585
Speaker 7:  button to pause the recording and then another button to start again. And

939
01:01:10,585 --> 01:01:11,265
Speaker 7:  we just keep going.

940
01:01:12,475 --> 01:01:16,405
Speaker 2:  Sometimes we get seltzers. I would say that's like the main ad break activity

941
01:01:16,585 --> 01:01:18,005
Speaker 2:  is, is a beverage. Yeah. But

942
01:01:18,005 --> 01:01:19,925
Speaker 7:  The, the show is not recorded in real time.

943
01:01:21,295 --> 01:01:24,165
Speaker 2:  There are people out there who want us to do The Vergecast live

944
01:01:25,075 --> 01:01:28,405
Speaker 2:  more. I would say that's a thing we will probably do occasionally. But there

945
01:01:28,405 --> 01:01:31,445
Speaker 2:  are people who are like, I want the unedited live version of The Vergecast.

946
01:01:31,445 --> 01:01:32,925
Speaker 2:  And I'm like, it would blow your mind.

947
01:01:35,345 --> 01:01:36,005
Speaker 2:  No, you don't.

948
01:01:38,275 --> 01:01:41,165
Speaker 7:  Yeah. We just are like, we we should take a break. All right. We're back

949
01:01:41,195 --> 01:01:44,445
Speaker 7:  like literally in the same breath. I say those words sometimes. Yep.

950
01:01:44,915 --> 01:01:47,085
Speaker 2:  Yeah. All right. That's a good one. All right. Let's see.

951
01:01:47,085 --> 01:01:50,485
Speaker 7:  This is like finding out that they do jeopardy all in one day and they just

952
01:01:50,485 --> 01:01:52,405
Speaker 7:  change our clothes. Like I was heartbroken.

953
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:56,605
Speaker 2:  Okay. I had a friend very recently who won several episodes of Jeopardy

954
01:01:56,625 --> 01:01:59,765
Speaker 2:  in a row, and I've only gotten like bits and pieces of the process of how

955
01:01:59,765 --> 01:02:03,365
Speaker 2:  they do it. And it is, it was like a hundred years ago, he

956
01:02:03,365 --> 01:02:07,165
Speaker 2:  filmed like a week's worth of stuff in an afternoon. Like just insane. Yeah.

957
01:02:07,165 --> 01:02:10,645
Speaker 2:  And it has ruined jeopardy for me forever. I don't even, it, it's fine, but

958
01:02:10,885 --> 01:02:12,205
Speaker 2:  I hate it. I can't watch it anymore.

959
01:02:12,425 --> 01:02:14,965
Speaker 7:  The only thing, the only thing I'll say about Jeopardy, one more thing about

960
01:02:15,125 --> 01:02:19,045
Speaker 7:  Jeopardy. I'm not prone to believe conspiracies exist because often too

961
01:02:19,085 --> 01:02:22,375
Speaker 7:  many people have to keep a secret, right? Like, we landed on the moon and

962
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:24,695
Speaker 7:  I know we land a moon because not enough people could keep the secret and

963
01:02:24,695 --> 01:02:27,135
Speaker 7:  we faked the moon landing for this long. Agreed. And then you're like, they

964
01:02:27,135 --> 01:02:30,735
Speaker 7:  keep Jeopardy a secret for a long time and you're like, Hmm, what are the

965
01:02:30,735 --> 01:02:33,855
Speaker 7:  drones doing over New Jersey? Like, that's fully where my head goes every

966
01:02:33,855 --> 01:02:34,575
Speaker 7:  time. I don't know,

967
01:02:34,635 --> 01:02:38,335
Speaker 2:  I'm, I picture Jeopardy is like a fully autonomous show. There's like, the

968
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:41,895
Speaker 2:  room is always there recording and people just come in and make a show

969
01:02:41,895 --> 01:02:42,335
Speaker 2:  sometimes.

970
01:02:43,035 --> 01:02:45,095
Speaker 7:  And the people who know like never leave the room.

971
01:02:45,165 --> 01:02:47,375
Speaker 2:  Exactly. Yeah. They live there. It's fine. To

972
01:02:47,375 --> 01:02:51,335
Speaker 3:  Any of our listeners who enjoy the Great British Bake Off, do not look up

973
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:53,415
Speaker 3:  how they make that show. It will ruin it for you.

974
01:02:54,035 --> 01:02:55,145
Speaker 2:  See. Yeah, that's

975
01:02:55,145 --> 01:02:57,745
Speaker 7:  Good. You asked us what we do during ad breaks and now we've ruined a baking

976
01:02:57,775 --> 01:02:58,865
Speaker 7:  show. Yeah, we're doing great.

977
01:02:59,115 --> 01:03:01,265
Speaker 2:  We're so sorry. All right, next up.

978
01:03:02,485 --> 01:03:06,465
Speaker 11:  Hi Vergecast. John Roco here. Two things for you. First, ever since you

979
01:03:06,465 --> 01:03:09,985
Speaker 11:  started doing all these additional podcasts, it's like, it's like so many

980
01:03:09,985 --> 01:03:13,265
Speaker 11:  podcasts. I loved it so much better when it was concise and it was just,

981
01:03:13,535 --> 01:03:16,945
Speaker 11:  just the Friday episode. 'cause now it's super hard for me to keep up with

982
01:03:16,945 --> 01:03:20,745
Speaker 11:  my other podcasts because all these podcasts are so

983
01:03:20,855 --> 01:03:24,505
Speaker 11:  good. I just subscribed. I love you guys. Keep up the great work. Thank

984
01:03:24,505 --> 01:03:24,625
Speaker 11:  you.

985
01:03:25,085 --> 01:03:27,745
Speaker 2:  So I wanted to pick this one because this is a question we've gotten a bunch,

986
01:03:27,745 --> 01:03:31,145
Speaker 2:  which is basically like, we do a lot more vergecast than we used to.

987
01:03:32,245 --> 01:03:35,985
Speaker 2:  And that is part of what you brought me here to do a couple of years ago.

988
01:03:37,205 --> 01:03:40,105
Speaker 2:  Do you want to, do you want to explain how we think about The Vergecast now?

989
01:03:40,495 --> 01:03:42,865
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I mean, you know, part of the answer is it's your job to figure it

990
01:03:42,865 --> 01:03:46,345
Speaker 7:  out, but the thing that I'm reacting to most is the idea that we used to

991
01:03:46,345 --> 01:03:46,745
Speaker 7:  be concise.

992
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:52,585
Speaker 7:  I don't, yeah, I don't know If you listened to our first album that was like

993
01:03:52,665 --> 01:03:56,545
Speaker 7:  a, you know, a quadruple sided pr prog

994
01:03:56,545 --> 01:04:00,265
Speaker 7:  rock exploration. It was, it was not Concise Sand

995
01:04:00,355 --> 01:04:01,745
Speaker 7:  Anisa is what we made. I

996
01:04:01,945 --> 01:04:05,505
Speaker 2:  Remember the early days of The Verge, we would record in the studio, in our

997
01:04:05,505 --> 01:04:09,465
Speaker 2:  office at four o'clock and we would leave at like six 30, like

998
01:04:09,475 --> 01:04:13,425
Speaker 2:  physically exhausted at the end of some episode. So it's like, I can't talk

999
01:04:13,455 --> 01:04:15,265
Speaker 2:  anymore after this episode.

1000
01:04:16,815 --> 01:04:20,585
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So I appreciate that in the, in the over the

1001
01:04:20,585 --> 01:04:24,465
Speaker 7:  haze of time We concision has been added to our list of qualities.

1002
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:29,745
Speaker 7:  I actually think having more episodes lets us be more focused because

1003
01:04:29,865 --> 01:04:33,145
Speaker 7:  we're not trying to cram every idea into one thing. And really

1004
01:04:33,805 --> 01:04:37,625
Speaker 7:  as you run a media company of whatever size, you start to

1005
01:04:37,625 --> 01:04:40,825
Speaker 7:  realize you have to make more focused products. They have things have to

1006
01:04:40,825 --> 01:04:43,425
Speaker 7:  go find their audiences. Our TikTok channel isn't really look at anything

1007
01:04:43,425 --> 01:04:45,505
Speaker 7:  like our homepage. And our homepage isn't really looking at anything like

1008
01:04:45,505 --> 01:04:49,345
Speaker 7:  our YouTube channel. And that's just how it goes, you know? And for

1009
01:04:49,345 --> 01:04:53,225
Speaker 7:  the podcast in particular, I think we know that

1010
01:04:53,225 --> 01:04:57,065
Speaker 7:  the Friday show has a big audience that does not want us

1011
01:04:57,085 --> 01:05:00,265
Speaker 7:  to mess with it too much. And there's just too much to fit into this show.

1012
01:05:00,685 --> 01:05:04,545
Speaker 7:  And the Tuesday show is, is allowed to tell more narrative kinds of stories

1013
01:05:04,605 --> 01:05:08,225
Speaker 7:  and build its own audience and wants a different kind of thing. So my

1014
01:05:08,225 --> 01:05:11,305
Speaker 7:  recommendation to anyone who thinks you're doing too much podcast

1015
01:05:12,085 --> 01:05:15,985
Speaker 7:  is figure out what you want from us and that we have probably provided

1016
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:19,725
Speaker 7:  to you. And that's a way for us to grow the audience

1017
01:05:20,305 --> 01:05:24,085
Speaker 7:  as opposed to just extracting more from the audience we have. And that's

1018
01:05:24,085 --> 01:05:27,605
Speaker 7:  really what we're after, is we want to grow our audience, particularly like

1019
01:05:27,605 --> 01:05:30,245
Speaker 7:  new audience. People have not encountered us before. We wanna go find them

1020
01:05:30,245 --> 01:05:32,845
Speaker 7:  with stories that are interesting and bring them into the fold. And you do

1021
01:05:32,845 --> 01:05:34,125
Speaker 7:  that with focus. Yep.

1022
01:05:34,385 --> 01:05:35,845
Speaker 2:  That's a good answer. I have no notes.

1023
01:05:36,595 --> 01:05:38,485
Speaker 7:  David's like, I'm doing three more episodes a week.

1024
01:05:38,485 --> 01:05:42,085
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Listen, eight days a week, Vergecast. Here we go. All right, one more

1025
01:05:42,085 --> 01:05:42,885
Speaker 2:  and then we're gonna take a break.

1026
01:05:43,945 --> 01:05:47,525
Speaker 10:  Hey, this is Leo calling from beautiful Holland, Michigan. Hey, I got a

1027
01:05:47,685 --> 01:05:50,845
Speaker 10:  question about The Vergecast meta episode and maybe a little bit of an axe

1028
01:05:50,845 --> 01:05:53,965
Speaker 10:  to grind. Hey, I'm wondering, you guys a couple years ago went through all

1029
01:05:54,085 --> 01:05:57,525
Speaker 10:  the work to make this beautiful redesign and rebrand of the theme song and

1030
01:05:57,525 --> 01:06:01,165
Speaker 10:  all that. I'm an audio podcast listener, so maybe this isn't true on the

1031
01:06:01,565 --> 01:06:05,005
Speaker 10:  YouTube version, but you guys have this great theme song and then a year

1032
01:06:05,005 --> 01:06:08,845
Speaker 10:  or two later you chopped it down. So we just had bu bu bubu,

1033
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:12,325
Speaker 10:  bu bu, which is a little bit of a bummer. And now for the last month or

1034
01:06:12,445 --> 01:06:15,285
Speaker 10:  two, it's just been bump bump, bump bump. Welcome To The Vergecast. And

1035
01:06:15,515 --> 01:06:18,725
Speaker 10:  what, what's the deal do you think? We don't have the attention span for

1036
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:22,605
Speaker 10:  it. Is this the TikTok ification of the show? Love to hear your thoughts

1037
01:06:22,605 --> 01:06:25,405
Speaker 10:  about why the theme song's been trimmed. Thanks guys of the show.

1038
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:27,965
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Liam, why has the theme song been trimmed?

1039
01:06:28,715 --> 01:06:32,685
Speaker 3:  Good question. He was close with the TikTok ification. It's not quite

1040
01:06:32,705 --> 01:06:36,485
Speaker 3:  TikTok though, it's YouTube. We want the YouTube to

1041
01:06:36,485 --> 01:06:40,325
Speaker 3:  match the audio feed. And on YouTube, starting out with a big long theme

1042
01:06:40,325 --> 01:06:44,275
Speaker 3:  song is just kind of, you know, not something people will

1043
01:06:44,295 --> 01:06:48,275
Speaker 3:  sit through. So we made a compromise and shortened it down. But I think this

1044
01:06:48,275 --> 01:06:51,915
Speaker 3:  person's right. I don't really like it either. So Eric, our,

1045
01:06:52,135 --> 01:06:54,755
Speaker 3:  our audio engineer and I, we're gonna go back to the drawing board and see,

1046
01:06:54,855 --> 01:06:58,795
Speaker 3:  see what we can do with our theme song to refresh it and not be

1047
01:06:58,815 --> 01:07:00,875
Speaker 3:  so jarring, for lack

1048
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:03,195
Speaker 7:  Of a better word. That's the third episode. Every week is just the full theme

1049
01:07:03,195 --> 01:07:04,955
Speaker 7:  song we should just publish it with. There

1050
01:07:04,955 --> 01:07:07,755
Speaker 3:  You go. I love that. Yeah. Can we sell ads against that?

1051
01:07:08,335 --> 01:07:12,035
Speaker 7:  We had a lot of fun. Breakmaster Cylinder who also did the decoder theme

1052
01:07:12,035 --> 01:07:15,835
Speaker 7:  song. Did the revamped Vergecast theme. I

1053
01:07:15,835 --> 01:07:19,795
Speaker 7:  don't, this is just some lore. Josh Polsky wrote The Vergecast

1054
01:07:19,805 --> 01:07:22,555
Speaker 7:  theme and really we were listening to that MGMT song that everyone liked.

1055
01:07:22,815 --> 01:07:25,675
Speaker 7:  You can see there's a direct line Oh yeah. Of inspiration there. So then

1056
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:29,395
Speaker 7:  we had that one. It was great. And then we don't, we didn't have the stems

1057
01:07:29,395 --> 01:07:32,955
Speaker 7:  like Josh, he just like made it on his computer and like, here's the thing,

1058
01:07:32,955 --> 01:07:36,875
Speaker 7:  like we made it all lost the midst of time. So we had to

1059
01:07:36,875 --> 01:07:40,435
Speaker 7:  like redo it so we could do all the stuff David's doing on the Tuesday episodes

1060
01:07:40,435 --> 01:07:43,275
Speaker 7:  with music beds and stuff. Like, we just needed more stuff.

1061
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:47,155
Speaker 7:  So this was a good time to like make more stuff. And it was really fun to

1062
01:07:47,155 --> 01:07:50,715
Speaker 7:  work with Breakmaster Cylinder. And there, I've always been worried that

1063
01:07:50,715 --> 01:07:54,115
Speaker 7:  we made it too aggressive. Like it's a cool thing to listen to,

1064
01:07:54,855 --> 01:07:58,435
Speaker 7:  but like there's like a saxophone break in it. Yeah. Which you,

1065
01:07:58,695 --> 01:07:58,915
Speaker 7:  if

1066
01:07:58,915 --> 01:08:01,955
Speaker 2:  Memory serves specifically requested in the theme

1067
01:08:01,955 --> 01:08:05,315
Speaker 7:  Song I did. It was my idea. Abstraction. Breaking it. So I think it's good.

1068
01:08:05,355 --> 01:08:09,315
Speaker 7:  I think I like, I like that people like it, but it, that's just

1069
01:08:09,315 --> 01:08:13,235
Speaker 7:  the lore of it is like literally Josh made the original theme

1070
01:08:13,235 --> 01:08:17,015
Speaker 7:  in garage band, like overnight and like all

1071
01:08:17,015 --> 01:08:20,815
Speaker 7:  lost to the midst of time. Like I've asked him like it's just gone.

1072
01:08:20,815 --> 01:08:24,375
Speaker 7:  Like it's not gonna come back. Yeah. So we just needed to remake it and

1073
01:08:24,595 --> 01:08:27,415
Speaker 7:  we had an opportunity to do it. We should use it more though 'cause it's

1074
01:08:27,415 --> 01:08:27,655
Speaker 7:  very good.

1075
01:08:28,035 --> 01:08:31,415
Speaker 2:  It is very good. And by the way, If you wanna blame YouTube for it, you should,

1076
01:08:31,435 --> 01:08:34,855
Speaker 2:  but you should specifically blame YouTube music and the way that it interacts

1077
01:08:34,855 --> 01:08:38,655
Speaker 2:  with YouTube and just the truly insane way that YouTube has approached podcasts.

1078
01:08:39,435 --> 01:08:41,895
Speaker 2:  But that is for another show. Alright, we gotta take a break and then we're

1079
01:08:41,895 --> 01:08:43,975
Speaker 2:  gonna come back and we're gonna grab back our way through the rest of these

1080
01:08:44,135 --> 01:08:44,855
Speaker 2:  questions. We'll be right back.

1081
01:11:11,285 --> 01:11:15,005
Speaker 2:  Alright, we're back with Neli Patel. We have some more questions. Neil, I

1082
01:11:15,005 --> 01:11:17,765
Speaker 2:  took one sip of water during that ad break If you wanna know how long

1083
01:11:17,765 --> 01:11:19,845
Speaker 7:  It was. No, we talked for five minutes. Neil and I, well Liam read stuff.

1084
01:11:19,905 --> 01:11:22,165
Speaker 2:  Sat for five minutes and listened to the as.

1085
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:27,805
Speaker 2:  All right, let's run through a few more. So th this is kind of a grab bag

1086
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:31,085
Speaker 2:  set of questions. We got a lot of people who just have questions about The

1087
01:11:31,405 --> 01:11:34,445
Speaker 2:  Verge, how we work, how we're thinking about things. So we're just gonna,

1088
01:11:34,445 --> 01:11:36,405
Speaker 2:  we're gonna plow through a bunch of 'em as fast as we can. Sound good?

1089
01:11:37,245 --> 01:11:37,535
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

1090
01:11:38,095 --> 01:11:39,335
Speaker 2:  Fabulous. All right. Here's the first one.

1091
01:11:40,435 --> 01:11:43,535
Speaker 12:  Hey guys. Now that The Verge has gone subscription, it's kept me wondering

1092
01:11:43,535 --> 01:11:47,215
Speaker 12:  about The Verge redesign. Again, I make websites and

1093
01:11:47,215 --> 01:11:50,895
Speaker 12:  digital products and things for a living and the redesign was kind of huge.

1094
01:11:51,315 --> 01:11:54,335
Speaker 12:  It kind of felt a little bit like Ben Thompson's aggregation theory of like

1095
01:11:55,275 --> 01:11:57,755
Speaker 12:  aggregating stuff from other sources and pulling the value into your own

1096
01:11:57,755 --> 01:12:01,595
Speaker 12:  homepage. And I'm curious how it worked just like as a

1097
01:12:01,595 --> 01:12:05,315
Speaker 12:  person who, who does this for a living? Did it work? To what extent did

1098
01:12:05,315 --> 01:12:08,955
Speaker 12:  it work? So I apply this same theory, other websites, a lot of, any

1099
01:12:09,195 --> 01:12:11,115
Speaker 12:  insights you can give. Thanks. Bye.

1100
01:12:11,925 --> 01:12:14,585
Speaker 2:  So we got a couple versions of this question. So just to, just to make it

1101
01:12:14,585 --> 01:12:18,065
Speaker 2:  very slightly broader than this, the, the question we got several times was

1102
01:12:18,065 --> 01:12:22,025
Speaker 2:  essentially it's been a little over two years since our redesign. We've

1103
01:12:22,025 --> 01:12:24,265
Speaker 2:  done the subscription, which is obviously another huge change to what The

1104
01:12:24,305 --> 01:12:27,425
Speaker 2:  Verge is doing. Looking back, did the redesign work?

1105
01:12:28,715 --> 01:12:31,775
Speaker 7:  Yes. And it's actually really funny you mentioned Ben Thompson because when

1106
01:12:31,775 --> 01:12:34,095
Speaker 7:  we launched the redesign he was like, oh, that's aggregation theory. And

1107
01:12:34,095 --> 01:12:37,655
Speaker 7:  I went onto his podcast and talked about it for an hour. Nice. 'cause that

1108
01:12:37,655 --> 01:12:41,415
Speaker 7:  is exactly what it is. If you have a big direct audience that you are already

1109
01:12:41,415 --> 01:12:45,135
Speaker 7:  serving, the easiest thing to do is make the

1110
01:12:45,135 --> 01:12:48,695
Speaker 7:  product more useful. And I actually got this idea in a pretty

1111
01:12:48,785 --> 01:12:52,695
Speaker 7:  tangential way. We had done a bunch of surveys about how people felt about

1112
01:12:52,695 --> 01:12:56,495
Speaker 7:  different tech companies and the most loved tech companies were Google and

1113
01:12:56,495 --> 01:12:59,015
Speaker 7:  Amazon every year that we ran the survey and Apple is actually kind of at

1114
01:12:59,015 --> 01:13:02,215
Speaker 7:  the bottom of the, the list of the big tech companies. And we were just like

1115
01:13:02,215 --> 01:13:04,975
Speaker 7:  trying to figure out why. And it's like, oh, these are utilities. People

1116
01:13:05,115 --> 01:13:09,095
Speaker 7:  use Google on Amazon every single day. Yep. And they kind of don't, they

1117
01:13:09,095 --> 01:13:12,775
Speaker 7:  just like use, they hold their iPhones to use Google and that probably has

1118
01:13:12,775 --> 01:13:15,095
Speaker 7:  shaped a bunch of our coverage, but it also shaped a bunch of our product

1119
01:13:15,095 --> 01:13:18,135
Speaker 7:  thinking, which is people come to our homepage every day and we should make

1120
01:13:18,135 --> 01:13:21,255
Speaker 7:  it as useful as possible. And then people will come back.

1121
01:13:22,035 --> 01:13:25,975
Speaker 7:  And this has come up also with Blue Sky recently. And the

1122
01:13:25,975 --> 01:13:29,695
Speaker 7:  way they treat links, like I think they've been pretty open. Like we're part

1123
01:13:29,695 --> 01:13:33,175
Speaker 7:  of the web, we will send you away. 'cause we know if we send you away to

1124
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:37,125
Speaker 7:  high quality things, you are more likely to come back. Yep. That,

1125
01:13:37,275 --> 01:13:40,165
Speaker 7:  that same idea we've had the whole time, we will send you away. We are happy

1126
01:13:40,225 --> 01:13:43,965
Speaker 7:  to link out, we're happy to link to our competitors. We have some ideas about

1127
01:13:43,965 --> 01:13:47,365
Speaker 7:  how to make that more seamless in a world of paywalls.

1128
01:13:49,025 --> 01:13:52,835
Speaker 7:  Stay tuned. But we, we just

1129
01:13:52,905 --> 01:13:56,755
Speaker 7:  know that making our own product more useful after two years

1130
01:13:56,895 --> 01:14:00,195
Speaker 7:  has worked Right. Time spent, our homepage has gone up by like minutes.

1131
01:14:01,275 --> 01:14:04,855
Speaker 7:  No one can move that number. Like it is an impossible number to move on almost

1132
01:14:04,855 --> 01:14:07,775
Speaker 7:  every product and our redesign accomplish it. 'cause there's just more to

1133
01:14:07,775 --> 01:14:10,135
Speaker 7:  look at and more places to go and then people come back.

1134
01:14:10,365 --> 01:14:14,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah. The idea of a homepage was like a, an open

1135
01:14:14,685 --> 01:14:17,485
Speaker 2:  question not very long ago. I mean like one, one of the things we talked

1136
01:14:17,485 --> 01:14:21,285
Speaker 2:  about, you showed me the very early versions of this before

1137
01:14:21,485 --> 01:14:25,325
Speaker 2:  I came back and I had come from a place where we were having genuine

1138
01:14:25,325 --> 01:14:28,765
Speaker 2:  conversations about like, is it even worth having in caring for a homepage?

1139
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:33,445
Speaker 2:  And I think I would say both history and the rest of the media

1140
01:14:33,805 --> 01:14:36,365
Speaker 2:  industry has proven homepage is pretty much correct the last couple

1141
01:14:36,365 --> 01:14:39,205
Speaker 7:  Years. Yeah. And not to harp on this, 'cause David hears me harp on this

1142
01:14:39,205 --> 01:14:43,085
Speaker 7:  all the time, but it is just about owning your own distribution. Right? This

1143
01:14:43,085 --> 01:14:45,325
Speaker 7:  is why people have email newsletters. They can email it to you directly and

1144
01:14:45,325 --> 01:14:48,805
Speaker 7:  there's not an algorithm between you and the audience. Our homepage is just

1145
01:14:48,805 --> 01:14:52,285
Speaker 7:  us. Here's a feed of stuff we liked. And you can

1146
01:14:52,715 --> 01:14:56,365
Speaker 7:  come look at our list of things that we liked. And people, I think people

1147
01:14:56,365 --> 01:15:00,085
Speaker 7:  enjoy that 'cause they know that we made it not the Facebook algorithm

1148
01:15:00,115 --> 01:15:04,045
Speaker 7:  made it or the X algorithm made it or whatever. So there's some

1149
01:15:04,045 --> 01:15:06,645
Speaker 7:  value there. I don't know if that's a thing you can just like Cold Start,

1150
01:15:07,235 --> 01:15:11,205
Speaker 7:  because it only works If you have an audience. It might work If you can

1151
01:15:11,805 --> 01:15:14,245
Speaker 7:  communicate to a big enough audience that this is what you're doing and there

1152
01:15:14,245 --> 01:15:17,965
Speaker 7:  there's continual value there. But the idea that your product should

1153
01:15:18,205 --> 01:15:21,125
Speaker 7:  directly be the most valuable thing that you make and you can show it to

1154
01:15:21,125 --> 01:15:24,965
Speaker 7:  people and you're, you don't let someone, someone else's distribution

1155
01:15:24,965 --> 01:15:28,925
Speaker 7:  get in the way that is everywhere in media right now. Right. That

1156
01:15:28,925 --> 01:15:32,285
Speaker 7:  is every newsletter author that is every homepage redesign that you're seeing.

1157
01:15:32,515 --> 01:15:34,445
Speaker 7:  It's, oh, we gotta take control of our distribution.

1158
01:15:35,195 --> 01:15:38,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Totally agree. All right, next up we have a question from Clemente

1159
01:15:39,265 --> 01:15:43,125
Speaker 2:  who says, I'm a huge fan of The Economist and I especially love their

1160
01:15:43,325 --> 01:15:46,605
Speaker 2:  print editions. There's something quite different sitting down with a nice

1161
01:15:46,605 --> 01:15:50,485
Speaker 2:  thick magazine with a bunch of amazing art. You guys could take

1162
01:15:50,485 --> 01:15:52,925
Speaker 2:  a page from The Onion and come out with a couple of editions a year, maybe

1163
01:15:52,925 --> 01:15:56,765
Speaker 2:  including your best long form pieces. Would The Verge ever

1164
01:15:56,765 --> 01:16:00,165
Speaker 2:  come out in print? We're the last website on earth. Would we ever be print?

1165
01:16:00,505 --> 01:16:04,245
Speaker 2:  That's Clemente question. And we have, I want to excuse

1166
01:16:04,505 --> 01:16:07,485
Speaker 2:  things like content goblins, which is amazing. Yeah. And everyone we've made

1167
01:16:07,485 --> 01:16:10,485
Speaker 2:  a lot of over the past year. But like, I think, I think the question is like

1168
01:16:10,485 --> 01:16:14,005
Speaker 2:  an ongoing sort of serious print product of our

1169
01:16:14,005 --> 01:16:15,685
Speaker 2:  journalism. Is that a thing you'd ever made seen?

1170
01:16:15,685 --> 01:16:18,645
Speaker 7:  Will we print out the website and mail it to you several times a year, but

1171
01:16:18,645 --> 01:16:22,285
Speaker 7:  like pretty a pretty, yeah. Maybe

1172
01:16:22,475 --> 01:16:25,925
Speaker 7:  like the world's most qualified maybe and the

1173
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:30,125
Speaker 7:  qualifications are a, a number of things have to go

1174
01:16:30,125 --> 01:16:34,005
Speaker 7:  our way in unlikely directions for that to be worth our time.

1175
01:16:35,045 --> 01:16:38,605
Speaker 7:  I wanna do it. Which is why it's a maybe I think it would be really fun.

1176
01:16:39,185 --> 01:16:43,165
Speaker 7:  And I've only ever worked in digital media and I've always just been jealous

1177
01:16:43,225 --> 01:16:45,765
Speaker 7:  of print covers. I, you, everybody who's listen to the show has heard me

1178
01:16:45,765 --> 01:16:49,645
Speaker 7:  say, I just wanna circle things in Red Pen. I watch David Haskell, the editor-in-chief

1179
01:16:49,645 --> 01:16:53,325
Speaker 7:  of New York magazine. He really does just print out the thing and like look

1180
01:16:53,325 --> 01:16:57,125
Speaker 7:  at the layouts. That's awesome. Yeah. Right. Like, it's cool.

1181
01:16:57,475 --> 01:17:01,205
Speaker 7:  It's a lot of work like closing every issue of New York

1182
01:17:01,445 --> 01:17:04,445
Speaker 7:  magazine. We, we watch them do it. They, they work on the floor just above

1183
01:17:04,445 --> 01:17:08,365
Speaker 7:  us in the New York office. It's a lot of work and it, that's a

1184
01:17:08,365 --> 01:17:12,245
Speaker 7:  50-year-old legendary magazine and work is worth it. We would have to just

1185
01:17:12,245 --> 01:17:15,485
Speaker 7:  start all that from scratch. And so maybe we can do it in some small ways.

1186
01:17:15,485 --> 01:17:18,965
Speaker 7:  Maybe we can do more regular zines, maybe even build our way up to it. That's,

1187
01:17:18,965 --> 01:17:22,365
Speaker 7:  that's the set of unlikely things that has to break our way. It, there's

1188
01:17:22,365 --> 01:17:25,565
Speaker 7:  nothing stopping us from doing it. It's just a whole other set of work that,

1189
01:17:27,535 --> 01:17:31,195
Speaker 7:  you know, time is a zero sum commodity. Like I, we, we would just have to

1190
01:17:31,745 --> 01:17:33,275
Speaker 7:  stop doing some other work to do that.

1191
01:17:33,975 --> 01:17:37,545
Speaker 2:  Yeah. All right. I would personally love to do it just because I want

1192
01:17:37,735 --> 01:17:41,545
Speaker 2:  back at Wired, they used to have like a, a row of vertical touch screens

1193
01:17:41,545 --> 01:17:44,105
Speaker 2:  and they would put a page up on each one and literally like page through

1194
01:17:44,105 --> 01:17:47,185
Speaker 2:  the whole magazine on the, it was awesome. I want that so bad.

1195
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:49,565
Speaker 2:  I don't think it worked, but it was cool.

1196
01:17:51,005 --> 01:17:51,805
Speaker 7:  I that's, they

1197
01:17:51,805 --> 01:17:54,685
Speaker 2:  Didn't seem to do any work, they just showed it to people and that was awesome.

1198
01:17:55,445 --> 01:17:59,405
Speaker 2:  Alright, next question. We're gonna do two more and then I'll let you get

1199
01:17:59,405 --> 01:18:03,255
Speaker 2:  out here. Here is one that I very much enjoyed. It's

1200
01:18:03,655 --> 01:18:05,455
Speaker 2:  particularly Neli question.

1201
01:18:06,945 --> 01:18:10,415
Speaker 10:  Hello, my name is Nick. I'm calling from Minnesota.

1202
01:18:10,965 --> 01:18:14,785
Speaker 10:  This is a question for the meta lowercase

1203
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:18,185
Speaker 10:  m how is The Vergecast or The Verge work episode?

1204
01:18:18,815 --> 01:18:20,105
Speaker 10:  Neli often says

1205
01:18:22,055 --> 01:18:25,865
Speaker 10:  that The Verge is like a Montessori and

1206
01:18:25,865 --> 01:18:29,825
Speaker 10:  he just lets people pursue their passions. But I would like to know

1207
01:18:29,865 --> 01:18:32,945
Speaker 10:  a little bit more about the nuts and bolts of that. There obviously must

1208
01:18:32,945 --> 01:18:36,865
Speaker 10:  be some check-ins and you know, how do you make

1209
01:18:36,865 --> 01:18:39,945
Speaker 10:  sure people are moving forward on projects or choosing the right projects

1210
01:18:40,445 --> 01:18:44,065
Speaker 10:  or pursuing passions that are relevant to your audience?

1211
01:18:45,905 --> 01:18:49,705
Speaker 10:  I am finishing a master's degree in organizational leadership. So these

1212
01:18:49,705 --> 01:18:53,225
Speaker 10:  types of people management and organizational development questions are

1213
01:18:53,225 --> 01:18:56,505
Speaker 10:  really interesting to me. I'd also like to know how has

1214
01:18:57,295 --> 01:19:01,025
Speaker 10:  that shifted as The Verge has grown? Right. It's easy to run

1215
01:19:01,225 --> 01:19:04,665
Speaker 10:  a Montessori style team when you have a team of six and make you harder

1216
01:19:04,695 --> 01:19:08,505
Speaker 10:  when there's a team of, I don't know, a hundred something. Anyway, bye-bye.

1217
01:19:09,785 --> 01:19:11,145
Speaker 2:  I did a decoder question for you.

1218
01:19:11,445 --> 01:19:15,265
Speaker 7:  Oh boy. Yeah, if you'd like to hear me contend with that question. I

1219
01:19:15,265 --> 01:19:19,065
Speaker 7:  spent an hour a week doing therapy with CEOs and that's all that show is.

1220
01:19:19,205 --> 01:19:22,625
Speaker 7:  Yep. How do I do this? Can you tell me? Do you know? Do you know how you're

1221
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:26,105
Speaker 7:  doing it? And the answers are often much more appealing than anyone wants

1222
01:19:26,105 --> 01:19:30,025
Speaker 7:  them to be. Yeah, it was easier at the beginning. That's actually the first

1223
01:19:30,025 --> 01:19:33,945
Speaker 7:  thing you know, there's still a handful of co-founders on our

1224
01:19:33,945 --> 01:19:36,385
Speaker 7:  team, Sean Hollister, Thomas Tricker, like we're all here. David was like

1225
01:19:36,665 --> 01:19:40,545
Speaker 7:  employee number one. I think all of us remember when it was

1226
01:19:40,545 --> 01:19:44,425
Speaker 7:  like 15 people in one room and we solved every decision by

1227
01:19:44,445 --> 01:19:47,665
Speaker 7:  all yelling at each other. Yep. Because no one had kids.

1228
01:19:48,965 --> 01:19:52,625
Speaker 7:  That's, that's super real. That's 24 hours a day in one room

1229
01:19:52,625 --> 01:19:55,865
Speaker 7:  yelling at each other. And that's how we did everything. And there was a

1230
01:19:55,885 --> 01:19:58,545
Speaker 7:  purity to that. I think it came out in the product. I think you could see

1231
01:19:58,545 --> 01:20:00,625
Speaker 7:  it in the product. It came out in the stress levels.

1232
01:20:01,975 --> 01:20:04,465
Speaker 7:  Certainly it came out in the alcohol use

1233
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:09,145
Speaker 7:  that is totally not scalable. I like, I have as much

1234
01:20:10,415 --> 01:20:13,865
Speaker 7:  fond recollection of our startup days as anyone. It was fun.

1235
01:20:14,805 --> 01:20:18,545
Speaker 7:  It was, you can't run an organization that way. And even if you're doing

1236
01:20:18,545 --> 01:20:21,025
Speaker 7:  the startup days, you still should stop it as soon as you can.

1237
01:20:22,645 --> 01:20:26,025
Speaker 7:  That's just not how to do it. So the, and now we're bigger, right?

1238
01:20:26,875 --> 01:20:29,705
Speaker 7:  We're much bigger and we're totally distributed. We're not even all in the

1239
01:20:29,705 --> 01:20:32,825
Speaker 7:  same room anymore. So we've, we have had to come up with a bunch of other

1240
01:20:32,825 --> 01:20:35,745
Speaker 7:  ways to communicate what we're doing and why we're doing it and how we do

1241
01:20:35,745 --> 01:20:35,825
Speaker 7:  it.

1242
01:20:37,425 --> 01:20:40,625
Speaker 7:  I think that the job as the editor in chief is just scaling taste

1243
01:20:41,415 --> 01:20:45,345
Speaker 7:  like all the publication is, is a taste at the end of the day. That's

1244
01:20:45,345 --> 01:20:49,145
Speaker 7:  all. It's like, that's what matters. Like here's some stuff

1245
01:20:49,145 --> 01:20:52,185
Speaker 7:  that's in, here's some stuff that's out, that's the whole publication. So

1246
01:20:52,325 --> 01:20:56,185
Speaker 7:  for us, it's just a lot of conversations about that. Why is this a verb

1247
01:20:56,185 --> 01:20:59,625
Speaker 7:  story and is this good enough? Are the only two questions I think I consistently

1248
01:20:59,725 --> 01:21:03,545
Speaker 7:  ask. Everything else is kind of just like on the margin, like tactical, like

1249
01:21:03,845 --> 01:21:06,305
Speaker 7:  did you talk to this person or we have, we written a good headline, but the

1250
01:21:06,305 --> 01:21:08,545
Speaker 7:  two questions that we come back to that the whole team is kind of always

1251
01:21:08,545 --> 01:21:12,025
Speaker 7:  asking is why is this virtual story and is this good enough? And If you get

1252
01:21:12,265 --> 01:21:15,705
Speaker 7:  everyone doing that all the time, you don't have to police it, right? Because

1253
01:21:15,905 --> 01:21:17,545
Speaker 7:  everyone knows that they're allowed to ask those questions to each other

1254
01:21:17,565 --> 01:21:21,545
Speaker 7:  and that they should know the answers and the answer to, is this

1255
01:21:21,545 --> 01:21:25,345
Speaker 7:  good enough? Is almost always no. Right? Right. Like that's the right answer

1256
01:21:25,345 --> 01:21:27,785
Speaker 7:  to that question. And then, then it's like, well wait, we have to get it

1257
01:21:27,785 --> 01:21:30,185
Speaker 7:  out the door. Like we're, we're in a race, we gotta get the story out the

1258
01:21:30,185 --> 01:21:32,865
Speaker 7:  door, we'll fix it later or something. Or it's, I need to go back and make

1259
01:21:32,865 --> 01:21:36,105
Speaker 7:  it better. And as long as everyone agrees that those are the shape of those

1260
01:21:36,305 --> 01:21:39,345
Speaker 7:  questions and that you should be prepared to answer them, then, then you're

1261
01:21:39,345 --> 01:21:42,985
Speaker 7:  fine. Like you can really trust everyone to go as fast as they can

1262
01:21:43,295 --> 01:21:46,105
Speaker 7:  because at the end of the day, everyone is asking themselves those questions

1263
01:21:46,165 --> 01:21:47,985
Speaker 7:  and prepared to ask one another those questions.

1264
01:21:48,585 --> 01:21:52,155
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's pretty good. And yeah, for more, listen to Neli talk on decoder

1265
01:21:52,155 --> 01:21:53,395
Speaker 2:  just incessantly all the time.

1266
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:54,315
Speaker 7:  How you do this.

1267
01:21:56,775 --> 01:21:57,195
Speaker 7:  That's

1268
01:21:57,195 --> 01:22:00,835
Speaker 2:  All I'm asking you. You joke that you started doing that show to learn how

1269
01:22:00,835 --> 01:22:04,355
Speaker 2:  to manage and it feels more and more true every episode, but the thing you're

1270
01:22:04,355 --> 01:22:07,715
Speaker 2:  realizing is that no one is good at it. And so it's like, I don't know if

1271
01:22:07,715 --> 01:22:08,875
Speaker 2:  that makes me feel better or worse. Do you

1272
01:22:08,875 --> 01:22:09,435
Speaker 7:  Have a plan?

1273
01:22:11,025 --> 01:22:12,835
Speaker 7:  What is it? Can you say it out loud? Something

1274
01:22:12,835 --> 01:22:16,715
Speaker 2:  About doors and decisions. That's all I know. Alright, last

1275
01:22:16,715 --> 01:22:20,155
Speaker 2:  one and then I'm gonna let you go. This is a question from Jeffrey. This

1276
01:22:20,155 --> 01:22:23,995
Speaker 2:  is going to sound like a really self-aggrandizing way to end this, but this

1277
01:22:23,995 --> 01:22:26,115
Speaker 2:  is a question we actually get a lot and I think it's interesting to answer.

1278
01:22:26,785 --> 01:22:30,155
Speaker 2:  Jeffrey says, what can we all do to ensure the viability, longevity, and

1279
01:22:30,155 --> 01:22:33,035
Speaker 2:  success of The Verge? Obviously the simple answer is subscribing, but I think

1280
01:22:33,035 --> 01:22:35,395
Speaker 2:  it's worth it to remind your loyal audience about the need to support the

1281
01:22:35,515 --> 01:22:38,235
Speaker 2:  website, whether it's through subscribing or other methods. I have the site

1282
01:22:38,235 --> 01:22:40,875
Speaker 2:  bookmarked and check it several times a day, consuming ads and giving you

1283
01:22:40,875 --> 01:22:43,715
Speaker 2:  clicks and theoretically some amount of revenue and bypassing the search

1284
01:22:43,715 --> 01:22:46,475
Speaker 2:  Google search algorithm and the associated ills. Are there other metrics

1285
01:22:46,585 --> 01:22:49,275
Speaker 2:  that help you show your reach and popularity that VERGE lovers should be

1286
01:22:49,275 --> 01:22:51,515
Speaker 2:  using? Do article shares matter? Should I click every affiliate link just

1287
01:22:51,515 --> 01:22:53,875
Speaker 2:  to help you out? Should I be following my favorite VERGE writers and other

1288
01:22:54,075 --> 01:22:57,635
Speaker 2:  social media x blue sky MAs on et cetera? First of all, Jeffrey, I love you

1289
01:22:57,635 --> 01:23:00,155
Speaker 2:  for asking this question. Yeah. And second of all, this is a question we

1290
01:23:00,155 --> 01:23:02,475
Speaker 2:  get a lot and I think goes back to what we were talking about at the beginning

1291
01:23:02,495 --> 01:23:06,195
Speaker 2:  of like of people want the stuff that they like

1292
01:23:06,495 --> 01:23:09,635
Speaker 2:  to succeed, right? It's why people cheer on their creators for getting brand

1293
01:23:09,635 --> 01:23:13,435
Speaker 2:  deals. It means you get to keep doing this, right? Like we, we want our favorite

1294
01:23:13,435 --> 01:23:16,835
Speaker 2:  teams to win. What does that look like for The Verge

1295
01:23:17,475 --> 01:23:21,355
Speaker 2:  throwing out, give us $50 a year, which you should do, come be part of the

1296
01:23:21,355 --> 01:23:24,595
Speaker 2:  community and comment mean things on all of Eli's stories.

1297
01:23:25,745 --> 01:23:26,955
Speaker 2:  What else goes on that list for you?

1298
01:23:28,135 --> 01:23:31,705
Speaker 7:  I've just come to accept that our competitors are not other

1299
01:23:31,705 --> 01:23:35,645
Speaker 7:  publications. They are creators. Hmm. I think

1300
01:23:35,645 --> 01:23:38,645
Speaker 7:  that's fine. I, I hope you've heard me say over and over again. I wish them

1301
01:23:38,645 --> 01:23:42,285
Speaker 7:  all the best. I think some of them do excellent work. I hope

1302
01:23:42,395 --> 01:23:45,365
Speaker 7:  they're even, I hope all of them are successful on their own terms and they

1303
01:23:45,365 --> 01:23:48,765
Speaker 7:  build their own businesses and everyone does a great job and has a good time.

1304
01:23:49,825 --> 01:23:53,775
Speaker 7:  We make something different, right? And that, that's fine. Like

1305
01:23:53,775 --> 01:23:57,415
Speaker 7:  our product is differentiated from the creator ecosystem

1306
01:23:57,835 --> 01:24:00,775
Speaker 7:  by din of the fact that we have our own distribution, that we have whatever

1307
01:24:00,775 --> 01:24:03,095
Speaker 7:  traditional journalistic ethics policy, all this stuff.

1308
01:24:04,945 --> 01:24:08,845
Speaker 7:  The thing that I think would help us the most in that ecosystem is

1309
01:24:09,105 --> 01:24:12,725
Speaker 7:  by having the same kinds of audiences that creators have that are

1310
01:24:12,725 --> 01:24:16,685
Speaker 7:  talking about them. And like, If you look at the comment section,

1311
01:24:16,995 --> 01:24:19,605
Speaker 7:  like a robust dialogue about what the creators are doing and why they're

1312
01:24:19,605 --> 01:24:23,205
Speaker 7:  doing it, and like they evangelize for their,

1313
01:24:23,425 --> 01:24:27,285
Speaker 7:  the people. And I, I don't know that any media organizations

1314
01:24:27,285 --> 01:24:31,255
Speaker 7:  have contended with that fact. Like as a group,

1315
01:24:32,765 --> 01:24:36,385
Speaker 7:  the journalism industry has been too high and mighty for too long.

1316
01:24:37,245 --> 01:24:40,605
Speaker 7:  I That is just a failure. Yes. I I see that failure, I perceive that failure

1317
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:44,845
Speaker 7:  very clearly. I think most people perceive that failure and you kind

1318
01:24:44,845 --> 01:24:47,765
Speaker 7:  of have the Jeff Bezoses of the world being like,

1319
01:24:49,235 --> 01:24:51,975
Speaker 7:  you trust the media less than Congress. The media will have even less than

1320
01:24:51,975 --> 01:24:55,535
Speaker 7:  an opinion now. Right? That's what he's doing with the Post, right? Patrick,

1321
01:24:55,605 --> 01:24:59,015
Speaker 7:  soon strong at the, at the LA Times billionaire owner of the LA Times is

1322
01:24:59,015 --> 01:25:02,855
Speaker 7:  gonna add a bias meter to their stories, an AI powered bias meter

1323
01:25:02,855 --> 01:25:06,575
Speaker 7:  to their stories. So you can push a button and he, and like read the other

1324
01:25:06,575 --> 01:25:09,775
Speaker 7:  version, like the unbiased version of the story. This is the most undercutting

1325
01:25:09,775 --> 01:25:13,135
Speaker 7:  thing you can do to a newsroom possible. Yeah. These are just reactions to

1326
01:25:13,135 --> 01:25:16,295
Speaker 7:  the idea that people don't trust the media. Okay. I I think those are wrong,

1327
01:25:16,425 --> 01:25:19,835
Speaker 7:  especially for our kind of newsroom, which is inherently

1328
01:25:19,925 --> 01:25:23,875
Speaker 7:  evaluative. Like I, we hold the phone and I'm like seven. Like

1329
01:25:24,305 --> 01:25:27,835
Speaker 7:  there's no there, there it is. Like, right, there's, there's straightforwardly.

1330
01:25:27,835 --> 01:25:31,675
Speaker 7:  We're like, this is bad, like all the time. So I think it's better

1331
01:25:31,675 --> 01:25:34,715
Speaker 7:  for us to say we are in a relationship with your audience and it's gonna

1332
01:25:34,715 --> 01:25:38,315
Speaker 7:  be the same kind of personal relationship, for lack of a better word,

1333
01:25:38,315 --> 01:25:41,515
Speaker 7:  parasocial relationship, where we're real people that you know,

1334
01:25:42,135 --> 01:25:45,795
Speaker 7:  and we're accountable to you the way that creators, I think, feel accountable

1335
01:25:45,795 --> 01:25:48,555
Speaker 7:  to our audiences on these platforms. There's a lot of dynamics in there that

1336
01:25:48,555 --> 01:25:52,515
Speaker 7:  I think are, are hard, but what I'm boiling my answer down to is like, you

1337
01:25:52,515 --> 01:25:55,595
Speaker 7:  should care about us. You should communicate with us. You should communicate

1338
01:25:55,595 --> 01:25:59,475
Speaker 7:  to other people about why what you're getting from us is

1339
01:25:59,475 --> 01:26:02,755
Speaker 7:  different or hopefully better than what you're getting from everything else.

1340
01:26:02,755 --> 01:26:05,805
Speaker 7:  Because that's really at the end of it. I don't wanna do a bunch of marketing

1341
01:26:05,805 --> 01:26:09,205
Speaker 7:  about our ethics policy. I wanna have an audience that's like, this ethics

1342
01:26:09,205 --> 01:26:13,165
Speaker 7:  policy is important to us and see more places try to copy

1343
01:26:13,225 --> 01:26:17,125
Speaker 7:  it to increase the quality of the media that people consume.

1344
01:26:17,855 --> 01:26:20,835
Speaker 7:  That's a big goal. I I, I just can't do that on my own. And that's, I think

1345
01:26:20,835 --> 01:26:21,755
Speaker 7:  the way you can help,

1346
01:26:22,665 --> 01:26:24,245
Speaker 2:  But also like, follow us on Blue Sky, right?

1347
01:26:24,395 --> 01:26:27,085
Speaker 7:  Yeah. But yeah, but also you might as well also buy every affiliate product.

1348
01:26:28,365 --> 01:26:31,965
Speaker 7:  I don't even know how that works. Will I do that? Just send me a check. Personally,

1349
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:35,845
Speaker 2:  I actually think that's the one you shouldn't do. I think If you send me

1350
01:26:35,845 --> 01:26:37,525
Speaker 2:  like a personal check Yes. To give it back.

1351
01:26:38,525 --> 01:26:40,245
Speaker 7:  I will read your name on the show.

1352
01:26:42,105 --> 01:26:46,005
Speaker 7:  But yeah, the the high-minded thing that just in the back of my

1353
01:26:46,005 --> 01:26:49,685
Speaker 7:  head all the time is if we are successful

1354
01:26:49,815 --> 01:26:53,795
Speaker 7:  doing it this way, we might push some people to

1355
01:26:54,135 --> 01:26:57,995
Speaker 7:  try and copy how we talk about our ethics policy and the making of the

1356
01:26:57,995 --> 01:27:01,795
Speaker 7:  journalism and the independence. You can see it with the independent

1357
01:27:01,795 --> 01:27:05,555
Speaker 7:  newsletter folks, right? That it's happening over there. You can see what

1358
01:27:05,555 --> 01:27:08,035
Speaker 7:  the 4 0 4 media post. I don't, I'm not saying you're copy this, but you can

1359
01:27:08,035 --> 01:27:12,015
Speaker 7:  see that there's a response to the void of

1360
01:27:12,015 --> 01:27:15,895
Speaker 7:  that stuff by talking about it more. And I'm just sort of like

1361
01:27:15,925 --> 01:27:19,055
Speaker 7:  hopeful that if we can build audiences

1362
01:27:20,675 --> 01:27:24,485
Speaker 7:  that like openly say in the market, this is the thing

1363
01:27:24,485 --> 01:27:27,205
Speaker 7:  we like, then there will be more supply of it.

1364
01:27:28,325 --> 01:27:30,625
Speaker 2:  That's pretty good. All right. You need to go?

1365
01:27:30,855 --> 01:27:34,305
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I quit. That was my last day. David's in charge now. Yeah. He's gonna

1366
01:27:34,305 --> 01:27:34,825
Speaker 7:  read all the ads.

1367
01:27:35,235 --> 01:27:37,305
Speaker 2:  Let's go post Red ads forever.

1368
01:27:38,895 --> 01:27:42,865
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Neli, we got lots more questions, so we'll, we'll find some other time

1369
01:27:42,865 --> 01:27:45,665
Speaker 2:  to, to keep going through some of these things, but thank you to everybody

1370
01:27:45,685 --> 01:27:49,185
Speaker 2:  who emailed and called and keep stuff coming. We got, we got

1371
01:27:49,815 --> 01:27:52,025
Speaker 2:  lots of stuff left to do, lots of stuff to figure out on the subscription.

1372
01:27:52,535 --> 01:27:56,505
Speaker 2:  Lots of new ideas about Vergecast stuff. If you want me to

1373
01:27:56,505 --> 01:28:00,425
Speaker 2:  read more ads, tell me lie it won't work, but you can tell 'em Anyway.

1374
01:28:00,855 --> 01:28:02,345
Speaker 2:  Neli, thank you as always. Thank

Speaker 7:  You.

1376
01:28:03,245 --> 01:28:05,305
Speaker 2:  All right, before we go, Liam, come back just for one second.

1377
01:28:05,655 --> 01:28:06,505
Speaker 3:  Sure. What's

1378
01:28:06,505 --> 01:28:10,345
Speaker 2:  Going on? We just made some CES plans. You know them better than I do,

1379
01:28:10,345 --> 01:28:11,985
Speaker 2:  so tell the people what our CES plans are.

1380
01:28:12,625 --> 01:28:16,585
Speaker 3:  Absolutely. The Virgil will be back at CES this year, but

1381
01:28:16,685 --> 01:28:19,625
Speaker 3:  what's special is that this year we're doing a live vergecast. It's gonna

1382
01:28:19,625 --> 01:28:22,945
Speaker 3:  be on January 8th, which is the Wednesday of CES week.

1383
01:28:23,275 --> 01:28:27,145
Speaker 3:  It'll be free and open to the public. And yeah, we're,

1384
01:28:27,145 --> 01:28:29,225
Speaker 3:  we're hoping to get a bunch of people out there to have good time with us

1385
01:28:29,285 --> 01:28:31,905
Speaker 3:  and, and just do live vergecast and talk about CES.

1386
01:28:32,115 --> 01:28:36,065
Speaker 2:  Where is it, are we doing it at like the, the Vegas stadium with 60,000 people?

1387
01:28:36,125 --> 01:28:36,465
Speaker 2:  Is that

1388
01:28:36,575 --> 01:28:40,105
Speaker 3:  Nope, we're gonna be right on the strip. It's at the Las Vegas

1389
01:28:40,545 --> 01:28:41,425
Speaker 3:  Brooklyn Bowl of all

01:28:41,425 --> 01:28:43,185
Speaker 2:  Places. There's a Brooklyn Bowl in Las Vegas.

1391
01:28:43,395 --> 01:28:45,585
Speaker 3:  We're bringing New York to to Vegas this year. There we go.

1392
01:28:45,905 --> 01:28:49,385
Speaker 2:  I love it. Yeah, we have a couple more episodes between now and the end of

1393
01:28:49,385 --> 01:28:53,265
Speaker 2:  the year, so we'll, we'll keep reminding y'all, but if you're going to CES,

1394
01:28:53,785 --> 01:28:57,185
Speaker 2:  it's Wednesday night, come hang out with us. It's gonna be very fun. I'm

01:28:59,145 --> 01:28:59,865
Speaker 3:  Will food and drinks,

1397
01:28:59,965 --> 01:29:02,445
Speaker 2:  So that's all that matters. All right, Liam, thank you. Of course.

1398
01:29:04,275 --> 01:29:08,245
Speaker 2:  Alright, that is it for the first cast today. Thank you to Helen and Neli

1399
01:29:08,245 --> 01:29:11,485
Speaker 2:  for being here. And thank you for listening and thank you especially to everyone

1400
01:29:11,825 --> 01:29:15,285
Speaker 2:  who called and emailed with questions. People are always like, oh, why do

1401
01:29:15,285 --> 01:29:19,125
Speaker 2:  you do these meta shows? Does anyone care? And frankly, I wonder this

1402
01:29:19,285 --> 01:29:23,165
Speaker 2:  sometimes too, but it's so fun hearing the stuff that you guys want to

1403
01:29:23,165 --> 01:29:26,645
Speaker 2:  know and understand and are thinking about and care about and are

1404
01:29:27,005 --> 01:29:30,845
Speaker 2:  engaging with us on. And we're still figuring all of this stuff

1405
01:29:30,845 --> 01:29:34,685
Speaker 2:  out as we go too, right? So this is a super fun thing to get to do

1406
01:29:34,995 --> 01:29:38,885
Speaker 2:  with all of you, and I'm so, so grateful for everyone who did it. This

1407
01:29:38,885 --> 01:29:42,765
Speaker 2:  is one of my favorite Virgin traditions that we do on this show, and

1408
01:29:43,535 --> 01:29:46,645
Speaker 2:  incredibly grateful for everyone who is part of it with us. So thank you.

1409
01:29:46,955 --> 01:29:50,725
Speaker 2:  There's lots more on our subscription, on our business, on

1410
01:29:50,745 --> 01:29:54,005
Speaker 2:  all of the stuff that we've been talking about at The Verge dot com. Eli's

1411
01:29:54,005 --> 01:29:57,565
Speaker 2:  note that he wrote when we first launched the subscription last week, I think

1412
01:29:57,565 --> 01:30:00,445
Speaker 2:  puts a lot of this in a really good perspective. So I'll make sure that's

1413
01:30:00,445 --> 01:30:04,085
Speaker 2:  in the show notes. Keep it locked on the website. Tell us what you want from

1414

Speaker 2:  If I'm being completely honest, I in particular have been bad about checking

1419
01:30:20,805 --> 01:30:24,045
Speaker 2:  the email recently because it just got overrun with spam at one point and

1420
01:30:24,045 --> 01:30:27,725
Speaker 2:  it became kind of annoying to dig through every single day.

1421
01:30:27,865 --> 01:30:30,565
Speaker 2:  But I actually think we solved the spam problem. I've been better at checking

1422
01:30:30,565 --> 01:30:34,205
Speaker 2:  it recently. So keep the emails coming. We love hearing from you.
