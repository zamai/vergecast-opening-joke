16
00:02:02,115 --> 00:02:05,435
Speaker 6:  A lot. I also feel like Netflix just green lit that for me just now.

00:02:21,065 --> 00:02:22,155
Speaker 4:  He's like babies laughing.

25
00:02:23,955 --> 00:02:25,955
Speaker 4:  I feel like I have to disclose it on the EP of a Netflix show.

Speaker 5:  My God, I love your work.

38
00:02:47,865 --> 00:02:51,675
Speaker 4:  It's good. Yeah. you know that when you plug a USB device

39
00:02:51,695 --> 00:02:55,235
Speaker 4:  in to, to Windows and it's like, do do, it's a good one.

40
00:02:55,935 --> 00:02:57,395
Speaker 4:  That's episode three. Yeah.

41
00:03:01,165 --> 00:03:04,405
Speaker 4:  I just, I'm just offering my, you know, you had a brainstorm. It's a spinoff

42
00:03:04,405 --> 00:03:07,285
Speaker 4:  for The Vergecast. All right. There's actually quite a lot of news this week.

43
00:03:07,715 --> 00:03:10,525
Speaker 4:  Yeah. We've gotta talk about what's happening to the iPhone. Emulators have

44
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:13,845
Speaker 4:  hit various app stores around the world, which is actually really interesting.

45
00:03:14,025 --> 00:03:17,285
Speaker 4:  Google has reshuffled its Android team, which we should talk about.

46
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:21,165
Speaker 4:  Meta launched its big AI push to compete with chat GBT.

47
00:03:21,665 --> 00:03:25,165
Speaker 4:  It is true that Sony announced the next generation of its million LED TVs

48
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:28,165
Speaker 4:  that will be a full hour in the middle of the show today. Then we got a couple

49
00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:31,325
Speaker 4:  of letting rounds and David's gonna do something he calls Headline Blitz

50
00:03:31,325 --> 00:03:32,925
Speaker 4:  with David Pierce. Yeah.

51
00:03:34,855 --> 00:03:35,205
Speaker 4:  Speed

52
00:03:35,205 --> 00:03:38,925
Speaker 6:  Round. I'm just, I'm gonna, it's the just sounds, but it's me screaming

53
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:41,485
Speaker 6:  headlines at you about TikTok. It's gonna be incredible.

54
00:03:42,845 --> 00:03:46,565
Speaker 4:  I also, I just want to, I'm gonna try to summon some

55
00:03:46,565 --> 00:03:49,885
Speaker 4:  energy in the world. It appears not today,

56
00:03:51,025 --> 00:03:53,965
Speaker 4:  but there might be a lightning round sponsor in The future. So If, you could,

57
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:55,645
Speaker 4:  everyone listening could just

58
00:03:56,555 --> 00:03:57,685
Speaker 5:  Send us the good vibes.

59
00:03:58,175 --> 00:04:00,845
Speaker 4:  We're gonna make it happen. Yeah, it's a, it's a guy named Steve.

60
00:04:01,985 --> 00:04:03,205
Speaker 4:  He, he gave me 20 bucks.

61
00:04:03,445 --> 00:04:05,005
Speaker 5:  I love Steve. Thanks for the 20.

62
00:04:05,115 --> 00:04:08,725
Speaker 4:  It's not Steve. Sorry Steve. Okay, let's talk about emulators on the app

63
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:12,125
Speaker 4:  store. This is a big deal. So If, you've been listening to Vergecast. you

64
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:12,285
Speaker 4:  know,

65
00:04:14,345 --> 00:04:17,485
Speaker 4:  the Europeans did some regulating as they want to do.

66
00:04:18,755 --> 00:04:22,725
Speaker 4:  They basically said you have to allow other app stores in Europe on iOS devices.

67
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:27,165
Speaker 4:  Those other app stores started appearing. One launched this week, alt Store

68
00:04:27,305 --> 00:04:31,125
Speaker 4:  pal. What's the first thing these alternative app stores want

69
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:34,645
Speaker 4:  to allow game emulators. It's the thing people want. There's been a little

70
00:04:34,645 --> 00:04:38,525
Speaker 4:  bit of back and forth about which emulators are going up first, which

71
00:04:38,525 --> 00:04:41,925
Speaker 4:  ones aren't. Apple responds to this by saying, you know what?

72
00:04:42,385 --> 00:04:46,125
Speaker 4:  We are going to allow emulators in our app store now because we

73
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:49,645
Speaker 4:  don't want people installing these other app stores. That means emulators

74
00:04:49,645 --> 00:04:53,365
Speaker 4:  have come to the i Apple Run io s App Store, the first good one

75
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:57,445
Speaker 4:  called Delta is out. It's been 10 years in the making basically RI test out.

76
00:04:57,445 --> 00:05:01,125
Speaker 4:  The developer isn't cranking away on it in various ways, gray

77
00:05:01,275 --> 00:05:04,645
Speaker 4:  area ways for 10 years. It's here. People are playing it and they're loving

78
00:05:04,645 --> 00:05:07,925
Speaker 4:  it. It's good. David, you've been tracking this all very closely. What's,

79
00:05:08,065 --> 00:05:08,725
Speaker 4:  what's the vibe?

80
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:12,285
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I'm just looking to see if this app is still the number one app in

81
00:05:12,285 --> 00:05:15,845
Speaker 6:  the app store. It is in fact still the number one app in the app store. So

82
00:05:16,265 --> 00:05:19,685
Speaker 6:  it was like two weeks ago. As you're hearing this, on Friday, I think two

83
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:23,165
Speaker 6:  weeks to the day since Apple did what it likes to do in these cases, which

84
00:05:23,165 --> 00:05:27,085
Speaker 6:  is just sort of update a support page without really telling anybody. But

85
00:05:27,085 --> 00:05:31,045
Speaker 6:  there are people watching these things. And basically over the last

86
00:05:31,675 --> 00:05:35,645
Speaker 6:  five days really we got The first, Apple

87
00:05:35,925 --> 00:05:39,685
Speaker 6:  emulator, which showed up in the app store and then fairly quickly

88
00:05:39,825 --> 00:05:43,725
Speaker 6:  was revealed to be a clone of the old version

89
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:47,725
Speaker 6:  of Delta, which was an app called gba four io

90
00:05:47,925 --> 00:05:51,685
Speaker 6:  s spelled just like it sounds really pulls off the tongue and

91
00:05:51,825 --> 00:05:55,445
Speaker 6:  it event it quickly got pulled from the app store and then another one came

92
00:05:55,445 --> 00:05:59,325
Speaker 6:  out, I think it was called Bii. It was out for a minute and

93
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,845
Speaker 6:  then the developer pulled it out of what the developer said was fear,

94
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:06,205
Speaker 6:  which we should come back to, which I think is fascinating. And then like

95
00:06:06,205 --> 00:06:10,045
Speaker 6:  you said, Delta came out, we've talked to RI on this show before. He was

96
00:06:10,045 --> 00:06:12,285
Speaker 6:  on the show last fall talking about emulators. He's been working on this

97
00:06:12,285 --> 00:06:16,205
Speaker 6:  forever. And at one point a few years ago, thought he

98
00:06:16,205 --> 00:06:19,325
Speaker 6:  was gonna be in the app store and then that got ripped away and has come

99
00:06:19,325 --> 00:06:23,045
Speaker 6:  up with, I would say, increasingly creative ways, If, you want to do some

100
00:06:23,045 --> 00:06:26,845
Speaker 6:  work to get this thing out. As soon as the announcement came out

101
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:29,405
Speaker 6:  that third party app stores were gonna be allowed, he announced he's been

102
00:06:29,405 --> 00:06:32,605
Speaker 6:  working on one. Like this was always the plan. And then I think it seems

103
00:06:32,635 --> 00:06:36,525
Speaker 6:  like basically just out of nowhere, apple was

104
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:39,085
Speaker 6:  like, yeah, you're cool. You can do this. And he was like, sick. I've been

105
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:43,085
Speaker 6:  building this for 10 years. Here it is. and it is like, I mean, it is a

106
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:46,765
Speaker 6:  remarkably good app for what it does.

107
00:06:47,425 --> 00:06:50,645
Speaker 6:  We can talk about the legality of ROMs and emulation. We should talk about

108
00:06:50,645 --> 00:06:54,565
Speaker 6:  all of that. I did a decoder episode with Sean Hollister on all of this like

109
00:06:54,565 --> 00:06:58,525
Speaker 6:  two weeks ago. It was very good, but it, it's, it's just so funny.

110
00:06:58,525 --> 00:07:02,485
Speaker 6:  This is like a version 10 app that just showed up on the app store

111
00:07:02,585 --> 00:07:06,485
Speaker 6:  all at once. Like, I think I can say this without getting me or ri in

112
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:08,845
Speaker 6:  trouble. This thing has been in test flight for a very long time because

113
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:12,765
Speaker 6:  there's a lot less review on test flight. You can

114
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:16,405
Speaker 6:  just test apps in beta. Some people can have them. I have had it.

115
00:07:16,835 --> 00:07:19,685
Speaker 6:  It's like it's out there and now all of a sudden he was able to just flip

116
00:07:19,685 --> 00:07:23,485
Speaker 6:  the switch and it is the number one app in the app store. So much pent up

117
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,605
Speaker 6:  demand for something like this. It's fascinating.

118
00:07:26,225 --> 00:07:30,165
Speaker 4:  So we should talk about the legality of it. Alex, I know you've been tracking

119
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:34,285
Speaker 4:  a lot of that stuff over time. There's a war on emulators

120
00:07:34,475 --> 00:07:35,645
Speaker 4:  generally occurring.

121
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:39,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah, yeah. Nintendo is, Nintendo for the longest time was

122
00:07:39,685 --> 00:07:42,445
Speaker 5:  like, you know what you do you, because the emulator audience I think was

123
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:46,045
Speaker 5:  fairly small and I think they have been kind of probably dreading

124
00:07:46,545 --> 00:07:49,245
Speaker 5:  and looking at this moment and knowing it was gonna happen at some point.

125
00:07:49,445 --> 00:07:52,925
Speaker 5:  'cause you can get 'em on Android and, and, and, and go to town,

126
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,165
Speaker 5:  but iOS, but

127
00:07:54,165 --> 00:07:54,685
Speaker 6:  It takes some work.

128
00:07:54,955 --> 00:07:58,405
Speaker 5:  Like it's, yeah, it takes some work and, and iOS is like, there's some impact

129
00:07:58,405 --> 00:08:01,765
Speaker 5:  there. And If, you can just automatically download this and then get your

130
00:08:01,885 --> 00:08:05,725
Speaker 5:  ROMs. That means you're not gonna pay Nintendo for kind

131
00:08:05,725 --> 00:08:09,205
Speaker 5:  of a similar version of it on your switch. Right. Like why would you do that

132
00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:11,725
Speaker 5:  when you can just have it on your iPhone?

133
00:08:12,005 --> 00:08:15,245
Speaker 4:  I mean, so the, the answer for the longest time is, and why doesn't Nintendo

134
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,925
Speaker 4:  make a Game Boy advance emulator and sell Ros?

135
00:08:19,825 --> 00:08:23,765
Speaker 4:  And the answer to that has been they don't want to pay 30% to

136
00:08:23,765 --> 00:08:24,325
Speaker 4:  Apple. And

137
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:28,525
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it's kind of like, I think the, the the more accurate, like,

138
00:08:29,795 --> 00:08:33,765
Speaker 5:  like emotionally, their response is, you know, that meme of, of

139
00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:36,085
Speaker 5:  your beloved,

140
00:08:37,345 --> 00:08:38,485
Speaker 4:  The meme of my beloved

141
00:08:38,825 --> 00:08:39,645
Speaker 5:  Singer, this

142
00:08:40,105 --> 00:08:41,165
Speaker 4:  Singer Mariah Carey.

143
00:08:41,345 --> 00:08:41,765
Speaker 6:  Mariah

144
00:08:41,815 --> 00:08:45,325
Speaker 5:  Carey. Okay. you know that one of Mariah, that's what I think of

145
00:08:45,545 --> 00:08:49,125
Speaker 4:  The meme of my beloved sounds like a very, very inexpensive Netflix

146
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:49,565
Speaker 4:  show.

147
00:08:52,385 --> 00:08:54,205
Speaker 4:  That's just a couple guys in an iPhone and

148
00:08:54,225 --> 00:08:57,965
Speaker 5:  One Yeah, that's like a, a freebie show. Yeah. Right. That's on freebie.

149
00:08:58,385 --> 00:08:59,085
Speaker 4:  I'm sorry.

150
00:08:59,825 --> 00:09:02,925
Speaker 5:  But you know that the Mariah Carey meme where she's like, I don't know her

151
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:06,005
Speaker 5:  and puts the glasses down. Yeah. That's kind of been Nintendo looking at

152
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:09,805
Speaker 5:  the iPhone for the last, like, last 15 years. Fair enough.

153
00:09:09,805 --> 00:09:12,005
Speaker 5:  Yeah. but don don't know her go away. Well,

154
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:15,605
Speaker 4:  But, but If, you put Nintendo games on the iPhone, you, you just reduce the

155
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:17,925
Speaker 4:  value of Nintendo's hardware. Right, right, right. Like that's the thing.

156
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:19,285
Speaker 4:  Yeah. That has been the problem. And

157
00:09:19,285 --> 00:09:22,125
Speaker 5:  That, that, that is the thing that's, that's what Nintendo is most focused

158
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:26,005
Speaker 5:  on, is they, they they've got a really good business of focusing on the hardware

159
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:28,725
Speaker 5:  and they, they've opened up right? They they've done some more development.

160
00:09:29,455 --> 00:09:33,365
Speaker 5:  Super Mario, is it Super Mario Run? I believe they've got some, some good

161
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:37,125
Speaker 5:  games on there and and they've even recently as like, I believe late

162
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:41,085
Speaker 5:  last year were kind of like, yeah, we're gonna start exploring more stuff

163
00:09:41,505 --> 00:09:41,725
Speaker 5:  on

164
00:09:43,265 --> 00:09:46,845
Speaker 5:  iOS. But they've, for the longest time they've not been a fan of it. And

165
00:09:46,845 --> 00:09:48,845
Speaker 5:  they've recently started going after these companies again,

166
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:53,405
Speaker 4:  Companies in like little groups. Yeah. So Jason

167
00:09:53,665 --> 00:09:57,165
Speaker 4:  Citron, the CEO of Discord is on decoder next week. Look out for that

168
00:09:57,955 --> 00:10:01,845
Speaker 4:  Discord just got what amounts to a cease and desist like legal orders

169
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:05,845
Speaker 4:  saying delete these channels, these servers that are hosting

170
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,925
Speaker 4:  emulator groups and they just wiped them out. Yep. And it's actually, when

171
00:10:09,925 --> 00:10:12,605
Speaker 4:  we talked about it, you know, he's like, the lawyers won't let me say,

172
00:10:13,825 --> 00:10:16,565
Speaker 4:  but basically he's like, we don't have a choice. And no one really knows

173
00:10:16,665 --> 00:10:19,805
Speaker 4:  how they ended up and not a choice. So you're just in this weird moment

174
00:10:20,335 --> 00:10:23,845
Speaker 4:  where this stuff has been tolerated because the distribution is

175
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:27,925
Speaker 4:  zero or handful of people in test flight who know Riley.

176
00:10:28,155 --> 00:10:31,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Or illegal in a way that's like, fine,

177
00:10:32,235 --> 00:10:35,685
Speaker 4:  there's a lot of arguments that it should be legal, but it's been

178
00:10:36,005 --> 00:10:39,525
Speaker 4:  tolerated. Yeah. Now it's in the store like apple's, like,

179
00:10:39,735 --> 00:10:43,165
Speaker 4:  screw it. The last thing we can allow is the rise of

180
00:10:43,165 --> 00:10:47,085
Speaker 4:  successful alternative app stores because there's demand for

181
00:10:47,085 --> 00:10:50,245
Speaker 4:  these emulators. We have to allow it in our store to keep people away from

182
00:10:50,245 --> 00:10:53,565
Speaker 4:  the alternative app stores. and it, it feels like this whole conversation

183
00:10:53,565 --> 00:10:54,725
Speaker 4:  is gonna come to some kind of head.

184
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:58,725
Speaker 6:  I totally agree. And I think this is sort of a truism of

185
00:10:58,745 --> 00:11:02,205
Speaker 6:  gaming in general that has held true over time. That people who wanna play

186
00:11:02,215 --> 00:11:06,205
Speaker 6:  games will jump through a surprising number of hoops in order

187
00:11:06,225 --> 00:11:10,205
Speaker 6:  to play games. Right. It's why all of the cutting edge PC hardware is

188
00:11:10,205 --> 00:11:12,845
Speaker 6:  given to gamers first because they're the ones who will pay for it and do

189
00:11:12,845 --> 00:11:16,405
Speaker 6:  the work to adopt it. It's why Apple allowed game streaming for the same

190
00:11:16,405 --> 00:11:19,645
Speaker 6:  reason people will go out of their way to do whatever they have to do in

191
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:23,245
Speaker 6:  order to play games. And so Apple has started to pull this stuff back, but

192
00:11:23,485 --> 00:11:27,205
Speaker 6:  I just keep thinking about when we did an episode on emulators on this show

193
00:11:27,205 --> 00:11:30,805
Speaker 6:  last year, Chris Plant, the editor in chief of Polygon, basically said when

194
00:11:30,805 --> 00:11:34,285
Speaker 6:  I asked when are we just gonna get Spotify for old video games? Why can't

195
00:11:34,285 --> 00:11:37,405
Speaker 6:  I pay 20 bucks a month to play all of these ROMs perfectly legally? And he

196
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:41,085
Speaker 6:  just looks me dead in the face and goes, no one actually wants that. And,

197
00:11:41,085 --> 00:11:44,965
Speaker 6:  and hi, his point was just that this group of people is so small and

198
00:11:45,145 --> 00:11:48,925
Speaker 6:  so irrelevant to the rest of the gaming industry that it's actually

199
00:11:48,945 --> 00:11:52,725
Speaker 6:  not worth the effort to care about them for Nintendo for

200
00:11:52,725 --> 00:11:56,325
Speaker 6:  anybody else. That it's like you leave them alone because odds are they're

201
00:11:56,325 --> 00:11:59,445
Speaker 6:  also buying your new games. And so that's great. You don't wanna piss them

202
00:11:59,445 --> 00:12:03,345
Speaker 6:  off, but it's just kind of a live and let live thing because it

203
00:12:03,345 --> 00:12:06,985
Speaker 6:  doesn't mean anything to anybody else. I think the fact that Delta is so

204
00:12:06,985 --> 00:12:10,065
Speaker 6:  successful and the fact that this has become such a big thing is going to

205
00:12:10,065 --> 00:12:13,905
Speaker 6:  be a really interesting moment in that story because

206
00:12:13,905 --> 00:12:16,945
Speaker 6:  this is the first time ever it looks like there is actual, honest to God

207
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:20,025
Speaker 6:  mainstream demand for something like this. Because If, you just download

208
00:12:20,025 --> 00:12:23,825
Speaker 6:  Delta, there's nothing there. It's just an app with nothing to do. You have

209
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:27,625
Speaker 6:  to fill it with stuff and that stuff has to come from somewhere. And that

210
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:31,545
Speaker 6:  stuff mostly comes from places that are not you dumping

211
00:12:31,735 --> 00:12:35,545
Speaker 6:  ROMs that are yours from your Game Boy cartridges, which

212
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:37,945
Speaker 6:  no one knows how to do and no one is going to know how to do. And you can

213
00:12:37,945 --> 00:12:41,225
Speaker 6:  just go on Google and search for Ros and they're all right there. So like,

214
00:12:41,225 --> 00:12:44,065
Speaker 6:  this stuff is just out of the shadows in a way it never has been

215
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:47,185
Speaker 4:  Before. I feel like notable Plex owner, Alex Cranz has a response. For You

216
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:47,705
Speaker 4:  David. I I

217
00:12:47,705 --> 00:12:51,105
Speaker 5:  Do. It is a lot easier. If, you wanna back up your carts now

218
00:12:51,325 --> 00:12:55,225
Speaker 5:  versus 20 years ago. That's true. There's a lot of different ways to

219
00:12:55,225 --> 00:12:57,905
Speaker 5:  do it. I think you can technically do it with some of the analog

220
00:12:58,665 --> 00:13:02,385
Speaker 5:  consoles and, and there's a whole bunch of little tools and stuff. And to

221
00:13:02,385 --> 00:13:05,465
Speaker 5:  be clear, Nintendo doesn't care as much about the NES games and the super

222
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:08,465
Speaker 5:  Nintendo games. Like when they went after Yuzu, that was because Yuzu was

223
00:13:08,465 --> 00:13:11,745
Speaker 5:  doing much more like it was doing the switch. Yeah. The thing actually out

224
00:13:11,745 --> 00:13:12,545
Speaker 5:  right now that you can hide

225
00:13:12,545 --> 00:13:15,425
Speaker 6:  Including tears of the Kingdom. Yeah. Like before other people were playing

226
00:13:15,425 --> 00:13:18,105
Speaker 6:  tears of the Kingdom. People on Yuzu were able to play tears of the Kingdom.

227
00:13:18,325 --> 00:13:22,025
Speaker 5:  And this next part I say as someone who owns the Super

228
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:25,425
Speaker 5:  Nintendo version of the analog Loves a Retro game.

229
00:13:26,455 --> 00:13:27,985
Speaker 5:  Have you played a retro game lately?

230
00:13:28,705 --> 00:13:31,545
Speaker 4:  I, so I'm watching Fallout and I was like, I should play fall at one. And

231
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:34,185
Speaker 4:  then I looked at it and I was like, I'm not gonna play fall at one.

232
00:13:34,415 --> 00:13:38,065
Speaker 5:  Okay. Yeah, it's, it's like watching old movies, you, it takes a very particular

233
00:13:38,135 --> 00:13:39,465
Speaker 5:  kind of person to be like, yes.

234
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:43,265
Speaker 6:  You know where they really work though is on the iPhone. Yes.

235
00:13:43,725 --> 00:13:43,945
Speaker 4:  So

236
00:13:44,285 --> 00:13:47,665
Speaker 6:  All the games that look like crap on your 60 inch 4K TV

237
00:13:48,135 --> 00:13:51,945
Speaker 6:  look great in a little square on your iPhone. It is the

238
00:13:51,945 --> 00:13:53,465
Speaker 6:  perfect place for this kind of thing.

239
00:13:53,845 --> 00:13:56,305
Speaker 5:  But it's, it's it in some ways. Right. but

240
00:13:56,445 --> 00:13:58,945
Speaker 6:  Don don't know this. I just know this hypothetically based on Yeah.

241
00:13:58,945 --> 00:13:59,625
Speaker 5:  Hypothetically,

242
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:02,945
Speaker 6:  You know, the internet and all of the carts that I have legally

243
00:14:03,195 --> 00:14:03,865
Speaker 6:  downloaded.

244
00:14:03,975 --> 00:14:07,545
Speaker 4:  This is great. Yeah. I feel like the fact that I am one

245
00:14:07,965 --> 00:14:11,865
Speaker 4:  in, in charge of this operation two, a fucking copyright

246
00:14:11,865 --> 00:14:15,825
Speaker 4:  lawyer and three deeply aware of the situation is all bad.

247
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:17,465
Speaker 4:  Like, I'm going to jail when I leave here.

248
00:14:17,745 --> 00:14:20,705
Speaker 5:  Yeah. They're actually, actually sitting out there. But just for neli, David

249
00:14:20,705 --> 00:14:21,345
Speaker 5:  and I get off

250
00:14:21,405 --> 00:14:23,985
Speaker 4:  The Nintendo police are here. They're like, Nintendo don't,

251
00:14:26,525 --> 00:14:26,905
Speaker 4:  I'm sorry,

252
00:14:28,705 --> 00:14:31,265
Speaker 4:  I, I couldn't apologize more deeply if I wanted to.

253
00:14:31,645 --> 00:14:32,145
Speaker 5:  Here's a,

254
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:38,265
Speaker 4:  So let's set aside the legality, right, because it, it is actually a weird

255
00:14:38,455 --> 00:14:42,385
Speaker 4:  gray area. There's a lot of parallels to Napster and ripping

256
00:14:42,785 --> 00:14:46,745
Speaker 4:  MP threes and it's a lot. Yeah. The law has changed.

257
00:14:46,795 --> 00:14:50,585
Speaker 4:  Maybe we'll come back and do a whole thing on the legality of, of that. Let's

258
00:14:50,585 --> 00:14:54,525
Speaker 4:  set that aside. One huge problem Apple has here is it

259
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:58,165
Speaker 4:  traditionally has not allowed emulation of any kind. and now it is

260
00:14:58,685 --> 00:15:02,565
Speaker 4:  allowing it, which means an entire library of software

261
00:15:02,795 --> 00:15:06,645
Speaker 4:  that people like better than Apple software is available and proving a

262
00:15:06,645 --> 00:15:10,605
Speaker 4:  very important point, right? Like Nintendo

263
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:14,485
Speaker 4:  games are better than the games that Apple has had heartedly supported

264
00:15:14,545 --> 00:15:18,485
Speaker 4:  for 10 years. Yeah. And they are running in emulation.

265
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:22,125
Speaker 4:  They're not sw they're not coded in Swift. The

266
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:26,085
Speaker 4:  controls are better, they're more portable, it's better. They like the whole

267
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:30,005
Speaker 4:  thing is showing a vision of what the iPhone

268
00:15:30,005 --> 00:15:33,845
Speaker 4:  could have been the whole time if Apple would just let go.

269
00:15:34,465 --> 00:15:38,285
Speaker 4:  Yep. And I, I feel like that's actually the bigger problem for Apple in

270
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:42,165
Speaker 4:  office. Like the next emulator that comes out is going to just

271
00:15:42,265 --> 00:15:44,525
Speaker 4:  be Windows 95. Right.

272
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:48,045
Speaker 6:  But it can't, that breaks the rules. This is like the, the

273
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:51,965
Speaker 6:  parsing Apple's review guidelines is so funny here because you can just

274
00:15:52,155 --> 00:15:55,725
Speaker 6:  tell the number of meetings they had to make sure what you just said is

275
00:15:55,725 --> 00:15:59,205
Speaker 6:  impossible. Lemme just read you two sentences. It says additionally,

276
00:15:59,495 --> 00:16:03,165
Speaker 6:  retro game console emulator apps can offer to download games.

277
00:16:05,205 --> 00:16:08,785
Speaker 6:  So much going on in that sentence, the following sentence, you are

278
00:16:08,785 --> 00:16:11,905
Speaker 6:  responsible for all such software offered in your app, including ensuring

279
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:15,185
Speaker 6:  that such software complies with these guidelines and all applicable laws,

280
00:16:15,795 --> 00:16:19,425
Speaker 6:  which applicable laws, who's to say, but the, the, the phrase

281
00:16:19,475 --> 00:16:23,155
Speaker 6:  retro game console emulator apps you

282
00:16:23,335 --> 00:16:27,155
Speaker 6:  is so specific and so lawyered to

283
00:16:27,555 --> 00:16:30,475
Speaker 6:  absolute death. What is, what, what counts as retro?

284
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:35,075
Speaker 6:  Who's to say Apple can do whatever it wants? What counts as a console? A

285
00:16:35,215 --> 00:16:38,875
Speaker 6:  PC probably doesn't like it is so narrowly tailored

286
00:16:39,055 --> 00:16:42,995
Speaker 6:  to just let Apple do whatever it wants in nothing else. In the funniest

287
00:16:43,095 --> 00:16:43,315
Speaker 6:  way.

288
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:47,555
Speaker 5:  I just think this is gonna somehow end up with all the Nintendo

289
00:16:48,115 --> 00:16:52,075
Speaker 5:  emulators getting kicked off because Nintendo raises a stink and we're just

290
00:16:52,075 --> 00:16:53,315
Speaker 5:  left with like Atari links

291
00:16:53,315 --> 00:16:56,915
Speaker 4:  There. But there can't be a universe. By the way, Atari links emulators

292
00:16:57,065 --> 00:17:00,795
Speaker 4:  rule. I had California games on my Atari links. That shit was awesome. You

293
00:17:00,795 --> 00:17:01,155
Speaker 5:  Had Atari

294
00:17:01,365 --> 00:17:04,755
Speaker 4:  Links. Oh yeah, I did not notably have a game gear. No,

295
00:17:05,355 --> 00:17:08,675
Speaker 4:  I had the other thing That's a bummer. I'm so sorry. I had the

296
00:17:08,685 --> 00:17:10,235
Speaker 4:  ostracized at links.

297
00:17:10,235 --> 00:17:13,395
Speaker 5:  You're the one that I could only find it like the Offbrand toy

298
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:16,115
Speaker 4:  Story. It wasn't great. I really wanted the TV tuner attachment. We, we we're

299
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:19,515
Speaker 4:  gonna come to TV tuners later. The show Curious We'll back. It's all thematically

300
00:17:20,055 --> 00:17:20,475
Speaker 4:  linked.

301
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:26,195
Speaker 4:  I'm just thinking about my entire links. It had the little cartridges that

302
00:17:26,195 --> 00:17:29,795
Speaker 4:  were like very thin. It was so cute. The Xbox 360 is a retro game console

303
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,155
Speaker 4:  at this point in time. Is

304
00:17:31,155 --> 00:17:31,355
Speaker 6:  It?

305
00:17:31,815 --> 00:17:35,355
Speaker 4:  Yes, of course it is. Maybe it's two generations ago. It's 20 years old.

306
00:17:36,075 --> 00:17:39,715
Speaker 5:  I think part of this is gonna be these companies who are actively selling

307
00:17:39,715 --> 00:17:43,035
Speaker 5:  it, right? Like, like Microsoft is pretty active in supporting old games,

308
00:17:43,035 --> 00:17:46,115
Speaker 5:  right? They they they're very backwards compatible. Nintendo's actually pretty

309
00:17:46,115 --> 00:17:49,925
Speaker 5:  backwards compatible Sony way less so. So, so I think

310
00:17:49,925 --> 00:17:51,525
Speaker 5:  there's a real potential of seeing like a PS

311
00:17:51,525 --> 00:17:55,205
Speaker 4:  One game. If, you are Microsoft. Yeah. You have a 20-year-old

312
00:17:55,205 --> 00:17:58,805
Speaker 4:  console. Why aren't you putting that emulator on the store tomorrow?

313
00:17:59,115 --> 00:18:02,525
Speaker 4:  Well some with the ability to download games for three bucks and you're giving

314
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:05,645
Speaker 4:  30 a buck to Apple and who cares? That is free money.

315
00:18:06,275 --> 00:18:09,965
Speaker 5:  Some consoles are harder to, to emulate than others. Right? Like, like the

316
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:13,885
Speaker 5:  Nintendo consoles, most of them are really easy. N 64. Yeah. Super

317
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:17,725
Speaker 5:  hard. Even on an iPhone today it is really hard to get in N

318
00:18:17,725 --> 00:18:21,565
Speaker 5:  64 games playing properly. And I think Xbox might be the same.

319
00:18:21,605 --> 00:18:24,485
Speaker 5:  I need to double check this, but I'm pretty sure that the Xbox 360, you don't

320
00:18:24,485 --> 00:18:28,365
Speaker 5:  see as big a robust emulator community around it

321
00:18:28,365 --> 00:18:32,045
Speaker 5:  as you do like Sony games. And part of that is, again, you can just go buy

322
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:35,845
Speaker 5:  those games. Like If, you have an Xbox, any kind of Xbox you can just go

323
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:38,085
Speaker 5:  and play Saints Row to or whatever.

324
00:18:38,155 --> 00:18:40,965
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Sony is an interesting example because Sony has done a really good

325
00:18:40,965 --> 00:18:44,605
Speaker 6:  job over the years of making its current

326
00:18:44,685 --> 00:18:47,445
Speaker 6:  consoles. And I confess, I don't have a PS five, so I don't know how true

327
00:18:47,445 --> 00:18:51,405
Speaker 6:  this still is now, but for a long time there were a lot

328
00:18:51,405 --> 00:18:55,125
Speaker 6:  of PS one and PS two games that you could play on a PS three and a PS four.

329
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:58,725
Speaker 6:  Like they've done a good job of keeping that stuff available and making it

330
00:18:58,755 --> 00:19:02,325
Speaker 6:  part of its cloud services and all this stuff. So I think

331
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,965
Speaker 6:  if I'm Sony, I can sort of see it in both directions where one, it's like,

332
00:19:05,965 --> 00:19:09,445
Speaker 6:  okay, this is helping me sell PlayStations, so I I want to do that. But on

333
00:19:09,445 --> 00:19:12,885
Speaker 6:  the other hand, I kind of agree that if Sony was just like, Hey, for

334
00:19:13,805 --> 00:19:17,765
Speaker 6:  whatever, 10 bucks a month, you can play every PS one game on your iPhone.

335
00:19:17,765 --> 00:19:21,565
Speaker 6:  Like I'd sign up for that in a heartbeat and it's just sitting there for

336
00:19:21,685 --> 00:19:21,805
Speaker 6:  them.

337
00:19:21,985 --> 00:19:24,565
Speaker 4:  It is true that some of this stuff is hard, but have you heard of the staggering

338
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:25,645
Speaker 4:  power of the Aeries trip?

339
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,965
Speaker 5:  I, so as you guys were talking, I was looking this up and apparently there's

340
00:19:29,965 --> 00:19:33,805
Speaker 5:  only really like one emulator for right now for Xbox 360. It's only for pc.

341
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:37,845
Speaker 5:  It's called Xenia, which love the name. And on Reddit there

342
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:41,765
Speaker 5:  is discussions. It, people are really weird about it. They're, they're

343
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:45,685
Speaker 5:  like, yeah, it sucks or it's fine. But it's apparently like one of the only

344
00:19:45,755 --> 00:19:46,045
Speaker 5:  ones.

345
00:19:46,505 --> 00:19:47,725
Speaker 4:  No, there's one called Zemo.

346
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,205
Speaker 5:  Oh there's also Zemo.

347
00:19:49,645 --> 00:19:50,965
Speaker 4:  Zemo is for the Mac. Yeah.

348
00:19:51,105 --> 00:19:52,365
Speaker 6:  How did you forget about Zemo? I'm

349
00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:54,245
Speaker 4:  So sorry. We're we're all just Googling weird. We're just

350
00:19:54,245 --> 00:19:54,685
Speaker 5:  Googling this

351
00:19:54,685 --> 00:19:58,125
Speaker 4:  Furiously now. The now the point is Microsoft is very capable of making the

352
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:01,885
Speaker 4:  products. Sony is very capable of making the product. It is free to them.

353
00:20:02,045 --> 00:20:05,965
Speaker 4:  'cause they already own the library. The demand is obvious

354
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:10,485
Speaker 4:  and the thing it's just gonna prove out is Apple's

355
00:20:10,545 --> 00:20:14,285
Speaker 4:  way of doing things has unnecessarily restricted user experiences

356
00:20:14,345 --> 00:20:14,805
Speaker 4:  on the Amazon.

357
00:20:14,805 --> 00:20:15,285
Speaker 5:  That's a good point. Yeah.

358
00:20:15,425 --> 00:20:19,285
Speaker 4:  Yep. And I, I, that is the danger because once that

359
00:20:19,415 --> 00:20:23,285
Speaker 4:  falls away and people are like, wait, this is better than when

360
00:20:23,285 --> 00:20:27,005
Speaker 4:  Apple is in tight control of this ecosystem, which is what we hear. By the

361
00:20:27,005 --> 00:20:30,965
Speaker 4:  way, when we talk about antitrust and control, we get an awful lot

362
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:34,525
Speaker 4:  of notes from people who are like, this is what I'm paying for, for Tim Cook

363
00:20:34,945 --> 00:20:37,125
Speaker 4:  to push all the buttons on my phone for me.

364
00:20:37,595 --> 00:20:41,165
Speaker 6:  Well, and I would point out that one of the really hard things about regulating

365
00:20:41,165 --> 00:20:45,045
Speaker 6:  that is proving the other way because a big part of what like the DOJ

366
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:48,605
Speaker 6:  in this case is saying is that it would be better if it wasn't like this.

367
00:20:48,945 --> 00:20:52,885
Speaker 6:  And that's so, so, so hard to prove. And this

368
00:20:53,105 --> 00:20:56,605
Speaker 6:  to your point, is going to be a very real way in which it is going to get

369
00:20:56,645 --> 00:20:59,485
Speaker 6:  a lot better very quickly because it changed.

370
00:20:59,745 --> 00:21:03,565
Speaker 4:  And I believe, I don't know, but I believe that's why the emulator rule

371
00:21:03,585 --> 00:21:06,685
Speaker 4:  is global and not just in Europe where Apple is

372
00:21:07,565 --> 00:21:11,205
Speaker 4:  required, like legally required to allow other app stores which would just

373
00:21:11,205 --> 00:21:14,645
Speaker 4:  go ahead and do this. They know they can see the outsized

374
00:21:14,785 --> 00:21:18,525
Speaker 4:  demand for emulators If. you allow other app stores with more

375
00:21:18,525 --> 00:21:21,365
Speaker 4:  permissive rules, people will flock to those app stores. They'll get the

376
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:25,325
Speaker 4:  demand. They'll be like, in Europe, we get game emulators, why don't we get

377
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:28,605
Speaker 4:  them here? Well I guess we need rules to allow other app stores in the United

378
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:32,605
Speaker 4:  and they're not. Right. I think they'd rather soon be in a lawsuit with Nintendo

379
00:21:32,605 --> 00:21:36,485
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Than have any political capital to open up the app model

380
00:21:36,485 --> 00:21:36,645
Speaker 4:  in

381
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:38,925
Speaker 5:  The United States. And that'd be a wild lawsuit, right? Because a lot of

382
00:21:38,925 --> 00:21:39,405
Speaker 5:  these games

383
00:21:41,155 --> 00:21:45,045
Speaker 5:  were made in a copyright was super weird in the eighties around

384
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:46,285
Speaker 5:  video games, if I remember correctly.

385
00:21:46,285 --> 00:21:47,205
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It remains super weird.

386
00:21:47,405 --> 00:21:51,045
Speaker 5:  I would say it's not, it is not, it's not easily sorted. So this would be

387
00:21:51,085 --> 00:21:52,525
Speaker 5:  a fight for Nintendo regardless.

388
00:21:53,825 --> 00:21:56,885
Speaker 4:  It Well it depends on who you're suing, what you're suing them for. Like

389
00:21:57,535 --> 00:22:01,325
Speaker 4:  again, the the the things that you would map it to

390
00:22:01,505 --> 00:22:05,285
Speaker 4:  are still Napster and Grokster. Yeah. In the

391
00:22:05,285 --> 00:22:08,965
Speaker 4:  Supreme Court and the appeals courts in those cases, like invented theories

392
00:22:08,965 --> 00:22:12,325
Speaker 4:  of liability. Like with Grokster it was like

393
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:15,445
Speaker 4:  you are enabling copyright infringement. you know, it's happening. You're

394
00:22:15,445 --> 00:22:18,685
Speaker 4:  marketing the thing for cop infringement. Now you are liable for copier infringement

395
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:22,605
Speaker 4:  even though you've done none yourself. Yeah. That's a, that's a bunch of

396
00:22:22,605 --> 00:22:24,525
Speaker 4:  steps down there. You gotta get all the way there.

397
00:22:26,105 --> 00:22:28,365
Speaker 4:  I'm not sure that you're gonna do that against a single developer. I'm not

398
00:22:28,365 --> 00:22:31,485
Speaker 4:  sure you can prove that case against Apple by allowing these emulators on

399
00:22:31,485 --> 00:22:35,405
Speaker 4:  your store, you know, this, you're marketing the iPhone to do this copyright

400
00:22:35,405 --> 00:22:38,205
Speaker 4:  infringement. There's a lot of road. That's a lot of steps.

401
00:22:38,435 --> 00:22:42,365
Speaker 6:  Okay. Yeah. It's also Apple is like the, the second sentence of

402
00:22:42,365 --> 00:22:45,845
Speaker 6:  that thing in the guidelines that I read is Apple pretty clearly foisting

403
00:22:45,845 --> 00:22:48,725
Speaker 6:  that responsibility on whoever is shipping the emulator. They're like, oh,

404
00:22:48,985 --> 00:22:52,405
Speaker 6:  if people use software in here that isn't yours to own, that's your problem.

405
00:22:52,585 --> 00:22:55,125
Speaker 6:  We, we told you not to. You've broken our terms of service. Well

406
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:58,925
Speaker 5:  That's why they pulled the the one app too, right? Like the, the was GBA

407
00:22:58,925 --> 00:22:59,685
Speaker 5:  four iOS.

408
00:23:00,185 --> 00:23:02,445
Speaker 4:  No, that is very confusing. Yeah,

409
00:23:02,525 --> 00:23:02,885
Speaker 6:  I agree.

410
00:23:03,385 --> 00:23:07,205
Speaker 4:  So IGBA comes out, that's the first emulator hit any of these stores.

411
00:23:07,275 --> 00:23:08,765
Speaker 5:  Okay, so not GBA

412
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:12,605
Speaker 4:  Fours. Right. But then RI tweets, hey this is a fork of GBA four iOS

413
00:23:12,665 --> 00:23:14,805
Speaker 4:  the thing that I made long ago

414
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,405
Speaker 5:  That I definitely never had on my phone at any

415
00:23:17,405 --> 00:23:20,525
Speaker 4:  Point. Right. And, and well his point was Apple makes all this noise about

416
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:24,165
Speaker 4:  how the app store is controlled and safe and here's just a bootleg of my

417
00:23:24,165 --> 00:23:27,645
Speaker 4:  decade old project that they let slide through while my real project

418
00:23:28,345 --> 00:23:31,285
Speaker 4:  is waiting sitting in review. Yeah. So he is like very irritated about this.

419
00:23:33,015 --> 00:23:36,805
Speaker 4:  Apple pulls the app and then in a classic sort of Apple

420
00:23:36,865 --> 00:23:39,845
Speaker 4:  way, there's no public explanation given of what they're doing. There's nothing

421
00:23:39,865 --> 00:23:43,805
Speaker 4:  we can link to. There's Mac rumors saying Apple has told us on background

422
00:23:45,435 --> 00:23:48,325
Speaker 4:  that they've pulled it for these two reasons, one of which is copyright.

423
00:23:48,475 --> 00:23:52,165
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's so important in this context to remember

424
00:23:52,195 --> 00:23:56,005
Speaker 6:  that Apple's review process is insane. Like, like in all

425
00:23:56,005 --> 00:23:59,805
Speaker 6:  seriousness, like anyone who claims that Apple's app review

426
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:03,365
Speaker 6:  process is consistent and has rules and

427
00:24:03,565 --> 00:24:07,445
Speaker 6:  make sense is just out of their mind. Right? And like we see this all

428
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:11,285
Speaker 6:  the time. It's so easy for bad apps to get through while people

429
00:24:11,425 --> 00:24:14,805
Speaker 6:  get their apps hung up on absolute tiny

430
00:24:14,805 --> 00:24:18,165
Speaker 6:  technicalities that don't actually have anything to do with anything. It's,

431
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,965
Speaker 6:  it's lunacy. And so I think what happened in this case is

432
00:24:21,995 --> 00:24:25,845
Speaker 6:  once it became obvious that this app was just a rip of Riley's app,

433
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:30,995
Speaker 6:  it's very popular. This is a new thing. It makes sense from Apple's perspective

434
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:34,755
Speaker 6:  to say you've violated the rules by borrowing someone

435
00:24:34,855 --> 00:24:38,435
Speaker 6:  else's app. I think there's even the rules borrowed in scare quotes in

436
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,395
Speaker 6:  Apple's guidelines that they can't borrow your work.

437
00:24:42,205 --> 00:24:45,395
Speaker 6:  Which is a very funny way to say. And so I think in this case it was, it's

438
00:24:45,455 --> 00:24:49,155
Speaker 6:  pretty easy and protected for Apple to say you just boosted somebody else's

439
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,795
Speaker 6:  app, you can't have this.

440
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:54,675
Speaker 5:  Well yeah and it, it was like, it basically had wiped some of the licenses

441
00:24:54,825 --> 00:24:56,315
Speaker 5:  that the original was developed with

442
00:24:56,315 --> 00:24:56,795
Speaker 4:  Classic

443
00:24:57,215 --> 00:24:58,155
Speaker 5:  Off off of it and

444
00:24:58,305 --> 00:24:59,635
Speaker 4:  Classic bad faith move.

445
00:24:59,745 --> 00:25:01,955
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And like filled it with ads, right? Yeah.

446
00:25:02,135 --> 00:25:05,275
Speaker 5:  So it was just all around like, no, this is garbage. Yeah. And the guy

447
00:25:05,915 --> 00:25:06,155
Speaker 5:  apologized.

448
00:25:06,155 --> 00:25:07,755
Speaker 6:  This is the thing that we see in the app store all the time. Do you remember

449
00:25:07,895 --> 00:25:11,275
Speaker 6:  the, when Flappy Bird came out and all of a sudden there were 40,000 flappy

450
00:25:11,275 --> 00:25:14,755
Speaker 6:  birds that all had a million ads or chat GPT when it came out and was first

451
00:25:14,755 --> 00:25:18,155
Speaker 6:  really popular, you could search for chat GPT and there were a billion things

452
00:25:18,155 --> 00:25:21,555
Speaker 6:  that kind of looked like chat GPT and were called chat GPT, but just had

453
00:25:21,575 --> 00:25:24,795
Speaker 6:  ads and would like steal your family from you. Like

454
00:25:25,645 --> 00:25:29,475
Speaker 6:  Apple is bad at this and and just continues

455
00:25:29,475 --> 00:25:33,395
Speaker 6:  to pretend that it is like in a firm hold of everything that happens on

456
00:25:33,395 --> 00:25:35,515
Speaker 6:  the app store and it just is not. Nope.

457
00:25:35,855 --> 00:25:39,675
Speaker 4:  So that's emulators here in the United States around the

458
00:25:40,185 --> 00:25:44,075
Speaker 4:  world because Apple knows if it allows emulators in alternative app

459
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:47,515
Speaker 4:  stores in Europe, people want them here. It's bad. So it's allowed them here.

460
00:25:47,905 --> 00:25:50,435
Speaker 6:  Wait, can I ask a legal question though? This is the thing I've been wondering

461
00:25:50,435 --> 00:25:53,715
Speaker 6:  about the last couple of days is this has been going on the, this idea that

462
00:25:54,455 --> 00:25:58,315
Speaker 6:  we now see what better looks like and that could be bad for Apple.

463
00:25:58,385 --> 00:26:01,755
Speaker 6:  I've been trying to figure out in my head if I'm Apple, am I

464
00:26:02,425 --> 00:26:05,475
Speaker 6:  more worried about, okay, this sort of prove the point that the iPhone gets

465
00:26:05,475 --> 00:26:09,115
Speaker 6:  better if we allow this one thing now it becomes more legally dicey. They're

466
00:26:09,115 --> 00:26:11,195
Speaker 6:  gonna say, well now we have to allow all these other things because we've

467
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:14,755
Speaker 6:  proven the point that it gets better when we do. Or does Apple say

468
00:26:15,765 --> 00:26:19,515
Speaker 6:  we've thrown you a bone or two, let's all shake hands and move on.

469
00:26:20,225 --> 00:26:22,395
Speaker 6:  Does that make sense? I'm trying to figure out like which is the winning

470
00:26:22,795 --> 00:26:23,195
Speaker 6:  strategy there.

471
00:26:23,575 --> 00:26:27,555
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna ask some AI generation program to generate Tim Cook

472
00:26:27,735 --> 00:26:30,875
Speaker 4:  and Jonathan Cantor and Tim who was saying, we've thrown you a bone or two

473
00:26:31,615 --> 00:26:34,635
Speaker 4:  now let's shake hands and like it'll blow up. Like we're gonna blow up a

474
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:38,035
Speaker 4:  data center With that prompted it is an unimaginable situation. Okay.

475
00:26:39,275 --> 00:26:43,205
Speaker 4:  I I think the danger for Apple is they will get forced into allowing

476
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:47,085
Speaker 4:  more and more things. This has long been the danger. This is why

477
00:26:47,085 --> 00:26:50,925
Speaker 4:  they have fought it for so long. We don't know what kinds of things

478
00:26:51,035 --> 00:26:54,925
Speaker 4:  will happen in the European market because other kinds of app stores are

479
00:26:54,925 --> 00:26:57,845
Speaker 4:  gonna let other kinds of things happen. So there's only one app store in

480
00:26:57,845 --> 00:27:01,725
Speaker 4:  Europe right now. It's by Riley Test out. It is called Alt

481
00:27:01,725 --> 00:27:05,605
Speaker 4:  Store Pal. It's gonna launch with Delta obviously. And

482
00:27:05,605 --> 00:27:09,285
Speaker 4:  this clipboard manager app clip, which is a type of app that is

483
00:27:09,285 --> 00:27:12,685
Speaker 4:  forbidden by Apple in the regular app store because a clipboard manager can

484
00:27:12,685 --> 00:27:16,565
Speaker 4:  see all the things that you are copying and pasting and da da da da. Totally

485
00:27:16,565 --> 00:27:19,405
Speaker 4:  normal. That clipboard managers on desktop computers, apple is not allowed

486
00:27:19,425 --> 00:27:22,365
Speaker 4:  on the phone. So here we go. Here's this one other kind of thing you can

487
00:27:22,365 --> 00:27:26,085
Speaker 4:  do in the iPhone that you couldn't do before. Is that gonna be enough to,

488
00:27:26,305 --> 00:27:30,125
Speaker 4:  to turn the tide of regulation around? I don't know, emulators obviously

489
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:33,005
Speaker 4:  were Yeah. Right. Yeah. So there, there's only one store right now.

490
00:27:34,475 --> 00:27:38,125
Speaker 5:  Yeah, yeah. There's only one store and then and there's no porn or gambling.

491
00:27:38,465 --> 00:27:41,765
Speaker 5:  And I feel like we, we made a bet. I think I may have lost a bet

492
00:27:41,765 --> 00:27:44,285
Speaker 4:  Somewhere. How quickly porn. Well I think Riley's been working on this store

493
00:27:44,285 --> 00:27:45,405
Speaker 4:  Yeah. For a long time. He,

494
00:27:45,405 --> 00:27:46,845
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And he didn't wanna put porn.

495
00:27:46,845 --> 00:27:50,085
Speaker 6:  Give it, give it a minute. Kranz. I, I absolutely do not believe you have

496
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:50,885
Speaker 6:  lost this bet yet.

497
00:27:51,075 --> 00:27:52,045
Speaker 5:  Okay. It's coming.

498
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:55,245
Speaker 4:  The second the Vision os app store opens

499
00:27:56,865 --> 00:27:59,205
Speaker 4:  the floodgates. Wrong phrase.

500
00:28:03,745 --> 00:28:04,445
Speaker 4:  I'm sorry boy.

501
00:28:05,055 --> 00:28:05,885
Speaker 5:  Don't cut any of that.

502
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:08,205
Speaker 4:  There's only one. The the point is there's only one store we don't know.

503
00:28:08,205 --> 00:28:11,485
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But the second, there's another compelling thing

504
00:28:12,075 --> 00:28:15,965
Speaker 4:  that you can accomplish with an app from another store that is

505
00:28:15,965 --> 00:28:19,565
Speaker 4:  compelling enough for anyone, any significant set of people to go download

506
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:23,325
Speaker 4:  that store and get that app. Apple will allow that thing. It,

507
00:28:23,345 --> 00:28:27,245
Speaker 4:  it seems inevitable that that is the, the just the how the

508
00:28:27,355 --> 00:28:31,165
Speaker 4:  flow of innovation is gonna go now. you know, we always joke that like, just

509
00:28:31,165 --> 00:28:35,045
Speaker 4:  the hint of competition makes these companies behave just like

510
00:28:35,045 --> 00:28:38,965
Speaker 4:  the, a whisper of competition here. You have both like

511
00:28:39,405 --> 00:28:42,525
Speaker 4:  mandated competition because of the regulators. There's now other app stores

512
00:28:42,905 --> 00:28:45,645
Speaker 4:  and there's gonna be way more than a whisper of competition. There's gonna

513
00:28:45,645 --> 00:28:49,285
Speaker 4:  be just people trying stuff. 'cause it's a land grab in

514
00:28:49,285 --> 00:28:52,725
Speaker 4:  Europe for iPhone customers again, which is cool.

515
00:28:53,235 --> 00:28:56,925
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah. And that pipeline of cool apps

516
00:28:56,995 --> 00:29:00,965
Speaker 6:  come out that Apple doesn't allow to, apple allows it

517
00:29:00,985 --> 00:29:04,085
Speaker 6:  so that people don't go through the hoops of downloading an app store. Like

518
00:29:04,085 --> 00:29:07,965
Speaker 6:  what it, what it seems is now obvious, and I'm so curious how far this

519
00:29:07,965 --> 00:29:11,845
Speaker 6:  will go, is that it is more important to Apple to keep you in the app

520
00:29:11,845 --> 00:29:15,765
Speaker 6:  store than to keep its rules about the App store. Oh yeah. Like

521
00:29:15,815 --> 00:29:19,645
Speaker 6:  Apple will bend massively as long as you

522
00:29:19,645 --> 00:29:23,405
Speaker 6:  stay in the app store and it's gonna be so interesting to see how

523
00:29:23,465 --> 00:29:27,365
Speaker 6:  far that extends. Like I I I am on record with like

524
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:30,965
Speaker 6:  the Apple sports stuff to say that betting and gambling is coming

525
00:29:31,465 --> 00:29:35,165
Speaker 6:  to Apple platforms in a way that people do not yet see.

526
00:29:35,345 --> 00:29:39,285
Speaker 6:  And I think this like porn I think is probably a pretty bright line

527
00:29:39,285 --> 00:29:42,405
Speaker 6:  for Apple that it, it won't cross for a variety of reasons, but like

528
00:29:43,055 --> 00:29:47,005
Speaker 6:  there will be popular betting apps that do things that Apple's

529
00:29:47,005 --> 00:29:50,565
Speaker 6:  apps won't let you do. And like how far will it go

530
00:29:50,945 --> 00:29:54,285
Speaker 6:  to keep as much in the app store as it possibly can is going to be a big

531
00:29:54,445 --> 00:29:55,285
Speaker 6:  question over the next year or so.

532
00:29:55,285 --> 00:29:59,205
Speaker 5:  Oh see, I I think the port is gonna happen as well. I think they're

533
00:29:59,205 --> 00:30:01,765
Speaker 5:  gonna do like in the App store. Yeah. I think they're gonna be like, oh,

534
00:30:01,865 --> 00:30:05,725
Speaker 5:  you can age gate it and then use Face ID to access your PornHub

535
00:30:05,725 --> 00:30:06,045
Speaker 5:  account

536
00:30:06,345 --> 00:30:08,085
Speaker 6:  And they'll tell a security story about

537
00:30:08,085 --> 00:30:10,605
Speaker 5:  It. Yeah, yeah. They're gonna do a whole security story about it.

538
00:30:11,395 --> 00:30:13,405
Speaker 4:  This is No, I disagree. Okay. Yeah. And I,

539
00:30:13,405 --> 00:30:16,325
Speaker 5:  Because you'll just see too much porn on the, the subway. No.

540
00:30:17,325 --> 00:30:20,885
Speaker 4:  Although here two things. One, as I was riding the subway into work this

541
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:24,445
Speaker 4:  morning, a woman was watching a horror movie with full

542
00:30:24,445 --> 00:30:27,365
Speaker 4:  speakers, no headphones. Oh, cool. And there was just a lot of deep breathing

543
00:30:27,365 --> 00:30:31,285
Speaker 4:  and then screaming, just horror movie. And for

544
00:30:31,285 --> 00:30:33,805
Speaker 4:  a while it was just deep breathing. So everyone was looking around the subway

545
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:37,245
Speaker 4:  car, incredible breach of subway etiquette all the way around.

546
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:40,925
Speaker 4:  And I was like, should I just give her my AirPods? Yeah. Like this might

547
00:30:40,925 --> 00:30:42,525
Speaker 4:  be worth the 200 bucks right now. Yeah.

548
00:30:42,845 --> 00:30:46,645
Speaker 6:  I honestly believe that If, you are listening to something on full speaker.

549
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:51,685
Speaker 6:  Everyone else within earshot is now firmly within their right

550
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:55,525
Speaker 6:  to come over and press pause or rewind or we're all watching this

551
00:30:55,685 --> 00:30:56,685
Speaker 6:  together now. Like you

552
00:30:56,915 --> 00:30:58,045
Speaker 4:  Just sit down next to the

553
00:30:58,045 --> 00:31:00,685
Speaker 6:  Person. Yeah. We're all watching this together. And I can be like, co can

554
00:31:00,685 --> 00:31:03,525
Speaker 6:  we just go back 10 minutes? I missed the part that was happening. You should

555
00:31:03,525 --> 00:31:05,645
Speaker 6:  be able to sit down next to 'em and be like, we're watching this together.

556
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:08,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Do the double tap to go back 10 seconds. Exactly.

557
00:31:09,935 --> 00:31:11,885
Speaker 4:  Don't do that. But If, you do let us know how it goes.

558
00:31:12,965 --> 00:31:13,165
Speaker 5:  Probably not.

559
00:31:13,365 --> 00:31:17,205
Speaker 4:  Well, I'm guessing not. Well. Okay. That was a side note. Here

560
00:31:17,205 --> 00:31:19,965
Speaker 4:  is why I think Apple won't just like, let porn happen. Okay.

561
00:31:22,935 --> 00:31:26,045
Speaker 4:  There was nothing to watch the other night. And I I did it. I watched Argyle

562
00:31:27,275 --> 00:31:30,085
Speaker 4:  welcome. It was bad. It was bad. It's real bad. Did his

563
00:31:30,115 --> 00:31:32,765
Speaker 5:  Hair ever move? Did he ever fix his hair?

564
00:31:33,395 --> 00:31:35,885
Speaker 4:  It's not, I don't want to say anything about this movie. What I wanna say

565
00:31:35,905 --> 00:31:39,885
Speaker 4:  is, throughout the entire period that I was watching Argyle,

566
00:31:40,245 --> 00:31:42,765
Speaker 4:  I was trying to imagine Tim Cook watching Argyle.

567
00:31:46,225 --> 00:31:49,685
Speaker 5:  Is that just like, if Tim Cook wouldn't do this, it won't appear on the app

568
00:31:49,685 --> 00:31:49,925
Speaker 5:  store.

569
00:31:50,165 --> 00:31:54,125
Speaker 4:  I I think that is as good of a content understanding for Apple as

570
00:31:54,325 --> 00:31:58,045
Speaker 4:  anything and you're like, this is about as far as as he's gonna go.

571
00:31:58,115 --> 00:32:00,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like he, he had to sit there

572
00:32:01,985 --> 00:32:05,645
Speaker 4:  and then he had to tell Matthew Vaughan that that was a good movie. Mm. Right.

573
00:32:05,645 --> 00:32:09,045
Speaker 4:  Like they, there was a, there was obviously a screening. This is a big Apple

574
00:32:09,045 --> 00:32:12,525
Speaker 4:  movie from the Twisted Mind of Matthew Vaughn. Yeah. UA Lippa in

575
00:32:13,545 --> 00:32:16,845
Speaker 4:  the thing. And then they all got up and the lights came on and in, you know,

576
00:32:17,305 --> 00:32:18,245
Speaker 4:  apple Park and Tim was like,

577
00:32:22,575 --> 00:32:23,445
Speaker 5:  Right. Yeah.

578
00:32:23,965 --> 00:32:27,725
Speaker 4:  I just, there's like a part of me that says like that there's a

579
00:32:28,085 --> 00:32:31,925
Speaker 4:  boundary on Apple's behavior. And I don't know exactly what it is about

580
00:32:31,925 --> 00:32:35,605
Speaker 4:  the image of Tim Cook watching Argyle. That makes me confident. The boundary

581
00:32:35,635 --> 00:32:39,405
Speaker 4:  will never get to porn. Yeah. But If, you just sit there. I

582
00:32:39,405 --> 00:32:43,205
Speaker 4:  don't watch Argo. I don't, I can't stress this enough. This is not a good

583
00:32:43,205 --> 00:32:46,885
Speaker 4:  use of your time. No, it's awful. It is just not a good use of your time.

584
00:32:47,985 --> 00:32:51,685
Speaker 4:  But If, you watch it and you imagine him cook watching it and being like,

585
00:32:51,685 --> 00:32:55,045
Speaker 4:  this is what I paid for. Mm. Yeah. Then, then there's a part of your brain

586
00:32:55,045 --> 00:32:58,805
Speaker 4:  that's like when the, the whatever Apple product marketing

587
00:32:58,805 --> 00:33:01,365
Speaker 4:  manager comes to him and says, all right, here's how we're gonna solve for

588
00:33:01,365 --> 00:33:05,125
Speaker 4:  the porn revenue. Yeah. Like that person will just like get Ed on site.

589
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:09,965
Speaker 4:  Like, he's like, my brain can't process this.

590
00:33:10,035 --> 00:33:11,805
Speaker 5:  He's just got a little spring in his office that he

591
00:33:14,115 --> 00:33:17,445
Speaker 4:  It's a beautiful Johnny. I, yeah. Liquid metal. Like,

592
00:33:18,035 --> 00:33:19,965
Speaker 5:  It's gorgeous. It looks kinda like the Webby Award.

593
00:33:20,025 --> 00:33:23,925
Speaker 4:  The design is obvious and it's minimalism, but it's just a box

594
00:33:23,945 --> 00:33:27,885
Speaker 4:  on a spring. It's like, all right, that's enough. Talk about Tim

595
00:33:27,885 --> 00:33:31,325
Speaker 4:  Cook and pornography in the same sort of mental space. We're sorry,

596
00:33:32,935 --> 00:33:35,565
Speaker 4:  we're not David, you're, I know you're covering it. Are there more app stores

597
00:33:36,065 --> 00:33:37,245
Speaker 4:  in the mix here?

598
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:42,045
Speaker 6:  I think so. So the, the first phase of this, there's been a

599
00:33:42,045 --> 00:33:45,605
Speaker 6:  handful of folks saying it's coming, right? And a lot of it is gaming. Epic

600
00:33:45,785 --> 00:33:49,525
Speaker 6:  has been loudly talking about doing this. The folks behind the, the

601
00:33:49,705 --> 00:33:53,525
Speaker 6:  Set app thing, which is like a subscription to a bunch of Mac

602
00:33:53,525 --> 00:33:56,165
Speaker 6:  apps. They've said they're working on some stuff. So I think we're gonna

603
00:33:56,165 --> 00:33:59,125
Speaker 6:  get more of these and there's gonna be a set of them that are like very

604
00:33:59,565 --> 00:34:03,445
Speaker 6:  professional and very legit and are sort of big businesses

605
00:34:03,555 --> 00:34:07,085
Speaker 6:  unto themselves. And then there's just gonna be this crazy

606
00:34:08,235 --> 00:34:12,085
Speaker 6:  minefield of new ideas. And I think those are gonna

607
00:34:12,085 --> 00:34:15,365
Speaker 6:  take a while from what I can tell. It's like it's hard work to build one

608
00:34:15,365 --> 00:34:19,245
Speaker 6:  of these things. And I think in Riley's case, he's been running alt

609
00:34:19,245 --> 00:34:22,885
Speaker 6:  store for a while and so there were, there was a bunch of paperwork and stuff

610
00:34:22,885 --> 00:34:25,525
Speaker 6:  to do to get this working. There was the, you have to get like a million

611
00:34:25,525 --> 00:34:28,445
Speaker 6:  dollar line of credit or something to open one of these app stores. Cool.

612
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:32,565
Speaker 6:  But he was able to, from what I understand, jump through these hoops

613
00:34:32,565 --> 00:34:34,085
Speaker 6:  relatively quickly if this is just a

614
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:37,085
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Because Tim Sweeney was like, here's a million dollar line of credit.

615
00:34:37,365 --> 00:34:38,325
Speaker 4:  I need this to start happening

616
00:34:38,355 --> 00:34:42,205
Speaker 6:  Basically. Right. And then if you're, if you're the, the MPA

617
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:45,605
Speaker 6:  folks who have been running set for a while, or you're epic, like you have

618
00:34:45,605 --> 00:34:49,565
Speaker 6:  the resources to do this, but If, you wanna just spin up an app

619
00:34:49,565 --> 00:34:52,325
Speaker 6:  store from nothing, it's actually pretty hard work. Yeah. And so I think

620
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:56,565
Speaker 6:  that my guess is like this fall and maybe even into

621
00:34:56,565 --> 00:35:00,445
Speaker 6:  next year is when the like truly weird stuff is gonna start

622
00:35:00,445 --> 00:35:01,765
Speaker 6:  to happen. But it is going to happen.

623
00:35:02,425 --> 00:35:05,205
Speaker 4:  My question is, what is the next set of emulators? Like, just to stay focused

624
00:35:05,205 --> 00:35:07,725
Speaker 4:  on emulators. Maybe Apple's not gonna allow Windows five.

625
00:35:07,725 --> 00:35:08,485
Speaker 5:  It's T links 95.

626
00:35:08,835 --> 00:35:11,445
Speaker 4:  It's definitely Ari Links, but like maybe Apple isn't gonna allow Windows

627
00:35:11,805 --> 00:35:14,805
Speaker 4:  emulation in this app store at the gate. But you can see

628
00:35:15,895 --> 00:35:19,885
Speaker 4:  maybe Alt store is gonna allow Windows 95 emulation and

629
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:23,165
Speaker 4:  we're all gonna be playing leisure suit Larry, on our iPads. Right. Like

630
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:27,125
Speaker 4:  it's interest. Yeah. You can see Commodore 64 mean is the Commodore

631
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,805
Speaker 4:  64 retro game console? I don't know.

632
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:33,365
Speaker 5:  Yes. I guess it was. Yeah, it was. I believe there was one briefly on the

633
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:33,605
Speaker 5:  store.

634
00:35:33,895 --> 00:35:36,365
Speaker 4:  There you go. I mean, oh yeah, that's right. What is the definition of a

635
00:35:36,365 --> 00:35:39,445
Speaker 4:  retro game console? Right? We could do another half hour on the birch chest,

636
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:43,365
Speaker 4:  I'm confident, but as that starts to open and the library

637
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:47,365
Speaker 4:  of acceptable software starts to expand, which Apple has

638
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:50,765
Speaker 4:  never allowed, they've wanted everyone to stay inside of their user interface

639
00:35:50,865 --> 00:35:53,445
Speaker 4:  and for good reason. I don't think these are bad things that Apple wanted.

640
00:35:54,135 --> 00:35:57,365
Speaker 4:  Right. They didn't want a bunch of weird flash ports in the iPhone in the

641
00:35:57,365 --> 00:36:00,765
Speaker 4:  beginning. They, they made very serious rules about how apps should look

642
00:36:00,765 --> 00:36:04,605
Speaker 4:  and feel so that the user experience would be great. I think

643
00:36:04,605 --> 00:36:08,405
Speaker 4:  that that the time limit on needing to do that has long since expired.

644
00:36:09,225 --> 00:36:12,805
Speaker 4:  So now it's like, what, what else is gonna be allowed here? And you can see

645
00:36:12,805 --> 00:36:16,525
Speaker 4:  that emulation of various kinds of other computers are gonna

646
00:36:16,525 --> 00:36:20,205
Speaker 4:  very quickly open the door to floods of other cool software,

647
00:36:20,415 --> 00:36:24,365
Speaker 4:  which all, most of which by the way won't be monetized by like weird micropayments

648
00:36:24,365 --> 00:36:26,525
Speaker 4:  and hat. Yeah. 'cause it's just old software.

649
00:36:26,825 --> 00:36:30,725
Speaker 5:  I'm curious, one that I think will be kind of interesting is Scum vm. So

650
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:33,325
Speaker 5:  Scum v Scum VM is a

651
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:35,005
Speaker 4:  Lot of, oh, what was that Game? Monkey Island.

652
00:36:35,035 --> 00:36:38,645
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Monkey Island Point and Click Games all made by Lucas Arts. Yeah.

653
00:36:38,695 --> 00:36:42,605
Speaker 5:  Which is now owned by Disney. And, and Scum VM is

654
00:36:42,605 --> 00:36:45,325
Speaker 5:  kind of like independently maintained by other people. And I'm like, oh,

655
00:36:45,505 --> 00:36:49,085
Speaker 5:  that's a really, that's one you always see anytime a system starts allowing

656
00:36:49,325 --> 00:36:52,205
Speaker 5:  emulators, the PSP, the the Vita. Like

657
00:36:53,035 --> 00:36:56,725
Speaker 5:  even the the Steam deck, that's one of the first ones you see. And it's like,

658
00:36:57,505 --> 00:37:00,405
Speaker 5:  is it gonna, is it gonna pop up soon? Are we gonna get scu vm? Are we gonna

659
00:37:00,405 --> 00:37:03,685
Speaker 5:  be able to play the dig in Monkey Island on this thing? Or is Disney gonna

660
00:37:03,685 --> 00:37:04,885
Speaker 5:  come around and say, Hey,

661
00:37:05,155 --> 00:37:09,045
Speaker 4:  Yeah, we'll see. I'm look, I it's gonna be what? There's a part of me

662
00:37:09,155 --> 00:37:12,605
Speaker 4:  that, the thing I'm looking forward to most is some sort of

663
00:37:13,015 --> 00:37:16,965
Speaker 4:  retro windows or Mac emulator. Yeah. That just lets me run a

664
00:37:17,045 --> 00:37:19,525
Speaker 4:  non-creative cloud version of Photoshop on an iPad.

665
00:37:21,035 --> 00:37:21,325
Speaker 5:  It's

666
00:37:21,325 --> 00:37:24,405
Speaker 4:  Close coming. That's coming, right? It's a, it's coming. Wes Davis, our weekend

667
00:37:24,405 --> 00:37:26,965
Speaker 4:  editor post on Threads a video of him playing,

668
00:37:28,305 --> 00:37:30,725
Speaker 5:  It was the Kirby, the Canvas Kirby game. Yeah.

669
00:37:30,725 --> 00:37:33,285
Speaker 4:  Yeah. On an iPad. The ds Yeah. For the Nintendo Ds. But he was playing it

670
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:37,125
Speaker 4:  with a stylus on iPad and it's like, that's better than any idea. And Apple's

671
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:38,405
Speaker 4:  had for an iPad game. Yeah. I was

672
00:37:38,405 --> 00:37:40,085
Speaker 5:  Like, that's, that's cool as hell. I love that.

673
00:37:40,345 --> 00:37:44,245
Speaker 4:  That's not great. I'm excited for it all Little chaos

674
00:37:44,305 --> 00:37:47,925
Speaker 4:  is good for this market. Yeah. All right. I want you all to go, we're gonna

675
00:37:47,925 --> 00:37:51,045
Speaker 4:  take a break. You all go Just watch the Argy trailer.

676
00:37:52,095 --> 00:37:56,005
Speaker 6:  Don't, don't do that. Why would you tell people to do that? Go

677
00:37:56,005 --> 00:37:58,685
Speaker 6:  do anything with your life other than watch the Argyle trailer.

678
00:37:59,835 --> 00:38:02,565
Speaker 4:  I've never watched a movie where I've, I've like openly wished the Apple

679
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:06,405
Speaker 4:  TV had a two x button. I'm just like, because I can't

680
00:38:06,405 --> 00:38:07,565
Speaker 4:  stop in the middle. Yeah,

681
00:38:08,225 --> 00:38:11,805
Speaker 5:  You don't just like walk out of the room like, I'm just gonna go do laundry

682
00:38:11,805 --> 00:38:14,085
Speaker 4:  Now. No, I gotta know what happened. It's just like a curse. This is why

683
00:38:14,085 --> 00:38:14,605
Speaker 4:  I watch so

684
00:41:39,645 --> 00:41:42,865
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back. For me, it was the scene where she started ice skating.

685
00:41:43,695 --> 00:41:46,465
Speaker 5:  Wait, who? Who I haven't seen it yet. No, this is spoilers. No,

686
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:51,105
Speaker 6:  We cannot do this. Listen, sometimes I would

687
00:41:51,105 --> 00:41:55,025
Speaker 6:  say The Verge cast is known for long diversions down strange rabbit

688
00:41:55,025 --> 00:41:58,145
Speaker 6:  holes. This is just like objective cruelty to our audience.

689
00:41:59,605 --> 00:42:02,425
Speaker 4:  I'm just, you know that famous story where Tim Cook looks at his lieutenant

690
00:42:02,425 --> 00:42:05,265
Speaker 4:  and he is like, why are you still here? Yeah. I literally imagined him standing

691
00:42:05,265 --> 00:42:09,185
Speaker 4:  up in the Steve Jobs theater when that happened in the movie and being

692
00:42:09,185 --> 00:42:10,465
Speaker 4:  like, why are you all still here?

693
00:42:10,705 --> 00:42:14,505
Speaker 5:  Matthew Vaughn just crying, running, weeping from the room.

694
00:42:15,455 --> 00:42:16,065
Speaker 4:  It's not good.

695
00:42:18,185 --> 00:42:20,745
Speaker 4:  I have so much to say about how bad this movie is. I can't, all right,

696
00:42:20,765 --> 00:42:22,425
Speaker 5:  That's, that's a, that's a Tuesday episode.

697
00:42:22,575 --> 00:42:22,865
Speaker 4:  It's

698
00:42:23,445 --> 00:42:25,545
Speaker 6:  No that, do that on decoder. Get that out. Here's a full,

699
00:42:25,545 --> 00:42:28,665
Speaker 4:  We're gonna get Matthew Vaughn on decoder and be like, all right, so the

700
00:42:28,665 --> 00:42:29,025
Speaker 4:  big reveal of

701
00:42:29,145 --> 00:42:31,065
Speaker 6:  The smoothie. How do you make decisions? And let's change that.

702
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:35,345
Speaker 4:  Whew. All right.

703
00:42:37,285 --> 00:42:41,265
Speaker 4:  All right. Speaking of decoder, oh, there's an org chart change of

704
00:42:41,265 --> 00:42:41,905
Speaker 4:  Google. Yeah.

705
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:44,225
Speaker 5:  Okay. That's a, that's that was a good segue. I love that.

706
00:42:44,265 --> 00:42:46,265
Speaker 4:  I pulled that one off. I was rehearsing that one. Yeah,

707
00:42:46,465 --> 00:42:46,905
Speaker 5:  I loved that.

708
00:42:47,225 --> 00:42:49,385
Speaker 4:  I looked in the mirror this morning, I'm like, we're gonna get this right

709
00:42:49,435 --> 00:42:50,705
Speaker 4:  today. Just nail it.

710
00:42:52,935 --> 00:42:53,225
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

711
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:58,665
Speaker 5:  So Google, Google's getting a whole reorg, like, or it's not just Google,

712
00:42:58,695 --> 00:43:02,225
Speaker 5:  it's Android, right? Because David, you, you actually spoke with Rick.

713
00:43:02,565 --> 00:43:04,145
Speaker 5:  You, you got the whole the whole thing.

714
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:08,585
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So the place to start is that Google is a famously

715
00:43:08,815 --> 00:43:12,385
Speaker 6:  well run company with an org structure that makes sense to

716
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:16,425
Speaker 6:  everyone and is is structured in

717
00:43:16,425 --> 00:43:19,145
Speaker 6:  order to make everyone produce good work. Are you right? We all agree on

718
00:43:19,145 --> 00:43:22,945
Speaker 6:  that as sort of the premise Yeah. Of all of this. No, Google is just

719
00:43:23,085 --> 00:43:27,045
Speaker 6:  abject chaos all the time. And this is like in large

720
00:43:27,075 --> 00:43:30,845
Speaker 6:  part, deliberate like the, from the beginning Google's whole thing has been

721
00:43:30,845 --> 00:43:33,765
Speaker 6:  like hire really good people and just sort of like turn them loose and it's

722
00:43:33,765 --> 00:43:37,685
Speaker 6:  just like a loose construction of smart people who make things. And

723
00:43:37,685 --> 00:43:40,805
Speaker 6:  that's fine as far as it goes. That's how you get Gmail, which was somebody's

724
00:43:40,805 --> 00:43:44,645
Speaker 6:  20% project, 20 plus years ago. Now it's also

725
00:43:44,645 --> 00:43:48,325
Speaker 6:  how you get 400,000 messaging apps and all of the weird

726
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:51,045
Speaker 6:  things that Google has built and killed over the years. But

727
00:43:51,835 --> 00:43:55,485
Speaker 6:  basically the, the thing that I have come to understand over the last couple

728
00:43:55,485 --> 00:43:58,405
Speaker 6:  of days of talking to people, including this new team at Google, which is

729
00:43:58,405 --> 00:44:02,365
Speaker 6:  basically a combination of Google's hardware team,

730
00:44:02,735 --> 00:44:06,125
Speaker 6:  which was run by Rick Oslow and its Android team,

731
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:10,245
Speaker 6:  which was run by roi, Lockheimer. roi, also ran

732
00:44:10,585 --> 00:44:13,725
Speaker 6:  Chrome, Chrome os, Google Photos, Google One

733
00:44:14,545 --> 00:44:18,525
Speaker 6:  and smattering of other stuff. But it basically oversaw like a lot of

734
00:44:18,525 --> 00:44:22,125
Speaker 6:  the most popular platforms where people actually interact with Google

735
00:44:22,255 --> 00:44:26,165
Speaker 6:  stuff. All of that is now being smooshed into one team under

736
00:44:26,195 --> 00:44:29,125
Speaker 6:  Rick Oslo. It's called the Platforms and Devices team.

737
00:44:30,225 --> 00:44:34,125
Speaker 6:  And the idea very much is to make all of that into

738
00:44:34,145 --> 00:44:37,845
Speaker 6:  one team so that they can run faster with ai. Like the whole story

739
00:44:37,955 --> 00:44:41,805
Speaker 6:  over and over is just ai. We have to do things faster.

740
00:44:41,905 --> 00:44:45,325
Speaker 6:  We have to make our moves more quickly. We have to be able to pivot faster.

741
00:44:45,325 --> 00:44:48,365
Speaker 6:  We have to be able to build new stuff faster. We need to have hardware, software,

742
00:44:48,365 --> 00:44:51,405
Speaker 6:  and AI altogether. We need to have full stack everything like

743
00:44:52,405 --> 00:44:56,385
Speaker 6:  Google. I think as we've seen over the last, what, 18 months

744
00:44:56,485 --> 00:45:00,265
Speaker 6:  now, got caught sort of off guard by

745
00:45:00,605 --> 00:45:04,305
Speaker 6:  the speed with which AI took over the world. Like Google built so much of

746
00:45:04,305 --> 00:45:08,145
Speaker 6:  this foundational technology and yet didn't beat

747
00:45:08,175 --> 00:45:11,625
Speaker 6:  chat. GPT to market like that is a failing of that company

748
00:45:12,165 --> 00:45:16,025
Speaker 6:  and they are now racing to keep up. And I think sort of

749
00:45:16,265 --> 00:45:19,025
Speaker 6:  smushing the hardware and software together, particularly on phones

750
00:45:20,365 --> 00:45:24,065
Speaker 6:  is a, a pretty huge shift in trying to make that go faster.

751
00:45:24,365 --> 00:45:25,585
Speaker 4:  So I have a number of questions here.

752
00:45:28,085 --> 00:45:31,825
Speaker 4:  One, I think Google was initially, Alex is just laughing.

753
00:45:32,005 --> 00:45:34,945
Speaker 5:  I'm just laughing. I was like the speed with your, I've got some questions.

754
00:45:35,105 --> 00:45:38,345
Speaker 4:  I just Yeah, I'm reading this. I mean, it's an org chart. Yeah. I,

755
00:45:39,065 --> 00:45:42,745
Speaker 4:  I have a number of ideas about this org chart change, but the core one is

756
00:45:43,135 --> 00:45:46,265
Speaker 4:  what you just said, which is Google was caught off guard by t it's failing

757
00:45:46,265 --> 00:45:49,185
Speaker 4:  the company. We're, it's, it's been a year now.

758
00:45:50,175 --> 00:45:53,025
Speaker 4:  LLMs are not as good as people said they were gonna be. Like the humane,

759
00:45:53,815 --> 00:45:57,665
Speaker 4:  like even If, you imagine a version of the Humane pin where

760
00:45:57,665 --> 00:46:01,545
Speaker 4:  the hardware was perfect and it was fast. It's still like that's the wrong

761
00:46:01,545 --> 00:46:01,905
Speaker 4:  bridge.

762
00:46:03,015 --> 00:46:03,305
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

763
00:46:03,735 --> 00:46:07,545
Speaker 4:  They, they just, there's no way for them to fix that problem. Right. And

764
00:46:07,545 --> 00:46:11,185
Speaker 4:  we have not seen any meaningful improvements on

765
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:14,945
Speaker 4:  hallucination for any of these models really? So you're like, yeah, they

766
00:46:14,945 --> 00:46:17,265
Speaker 4:  were caught off guard and then they were really worried that Google search

767
00:46:17,265 --> 00:46:21,065
Speaker 4:  would go away. Satya Nadella is out there being like, I'm makeup

768
00:46:21,075 --> 00:46:25,025
Speaker 4:  dance. I would, it is true that Google started

769
00:46:25,025 --> 00:46:26,025
Speaker 4:  dancing. They, they

770
00:46:26,025 --> 00:46:27,145
Speaker 5:  Did a little tippy tap dance,

771
00:46:27,365 --> 00:46:28,865
Speaker 6:  But Sya Nadella didn't do it.

772
00:46:30,135 --> 00:46:34,025
Speaker 4:  Yeah, right. It's like, but that wasn't, Bing has not been the

773
00:46:34,025 --> 00:46:37,305
Speaker 4:  beneficiary of said dancing in any way, shape, or form. Nope. Google, I would

774
00:46:37,305 --> 00:46:41,265
Speaker 4:  say dancing without rhyme or reason. Not a lot of

775
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:44,705
Speaker 4:  rhythm in the, the dancing happening in Mountain View. Agreed.

776
00:46:45,045 --> 00:46:48,105
Speaker 4:  And so it's like if If you believe that that is the thing that set them into

777
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:50,025
Speaker 4:  action, that's the thing they're talking about. Like to what end,

778
00:46:51,705 --> 00:46:55,225
Speaker 6:  I don't know if I'm being completely honest and I feel like this is the strange

779
00:46:55,225 --> 00:46:59,025
Speaker 6:  moment we've come to in ai. Like you had Drew Houseton on

780
00:46:59,215 --> 00:47:03,105
Speaker 6:  decoder this week, I think, and he repeated the line

781
00:47:03,105 --> 00:47:06,705
Speaker 6:  that Sundar Phai and others have said that AI is as important as fire. Like

782
00:47:06,705 --> 00:47:10,585
Speaker 6:  people just say that unironically, that that this is the

783
00:47:10,585 --> 00:47:13,585
Speaker 6:  most important thing that has ever happened to society. Like literally that's

784
00:47:13,585 --> 00:47:14,985
Speaker 6:  a thing people say out loud. And

785
00:47:18,445 --> 00:47:21,785
Speaker 6:  is it like, is there any actual evidence of that so far?

786
00:47:23,065 --> 00:47:26,945
Speaker 5:  I mean, I, I would say yeah, Liz,

787
00:47:27,005 --> 00:47:27,905
Speaker 5:  Liz and I fire

788
00:47:27,975 --> 00:47:31,885
Speaker 6:  Alex. Yeah. Fire also electricity. I would say there's ample evidence. It's

789
00:47:31,885 --> 00:47:33,565
Speaker 6:  not crypto like I think, no, I

790
00:47:33,565 --> 00:47:36,565
Speaker 5:  Think we're there. Yeah. I think, I think Liz and I have talked about this

791
00:47:36,605 --> 00:47:40,165
Speaker 5:  a lot. She gets like weird 2:00 AM texts from me just being like, do you

792
00:47:40,555 --> 00:47:43,285
Speaker 5:  think that like AI is the biggest thing since

793
00:47:44,465 --> 00:47:48,205
Speaker 4:  If Liz Internet Liz is not responding to these texts with AI generator responses?

794
00:47:48,325 --> 00:47:48,965
Speaker 4:  I don't know what we're

795
00:47:48,965 --> 00:47:52,005
Speaker 5:  Doing here. No. She's always fully in the conversation with me.

796
00:47:53,675 --> 00:47:57,645
Speaker 5:  It's really nice that she returns my calls. Thank you, Liz. But I, I do think

797
00:47:57,645 --> 00:48:01,285
Speaker 5:  that like AI is artificial intelligence as a whole, not necessarily

798
00:48:01,355 --> 00:48:05,325
Speaker 5:  just generative AI is a pretty big moment, right? Like, like

799
00:48:05,325 --> 00:48:09,085
Speaker 5:  there's a form of automation that is, that is enormous and,

800
00:48:09,105 --> 00:48:12,925
Speaker 5:  and it covers a whole lot of different industries. And that kind of big

801
00:48:13,125 --> 00:48:16,885
Speaker 5:  C change is very rare. and it is as big as the internet. It is as big

802
00:48:17,305 --> 00:48:21,205
Speaker 5:  as when we started automating, you know, machinery and stuff like that. Like

803
00:48:21,205 --> 00:48:24,965
Speaker 5:  it's a big moment, but it happens in fits and spurts and,

804
00:48:25,025 --> 00:48:28,285
Speaker 5:  and, and stuff. And right now we're kind of, in a moment,

805
00:48:29,635 --> 00:48:30,605
Speaker 5:  it's a technical term,

806
00:48:30,615 --> 00:48:34,125
Speaker 6:  Right? It's only obvious which things qualify in

807
00:48:34,365 --> 00:48:37,605
Speaker 6:  retrospect, right? Like If, you, if you're running one of these companies,

808
00:48:37,705 --> 00:48:41,565
Speaker 6:  you look at what the internet did 25 years ago and you look at what

809
00:48:42,225 --> 00:48:46,085
Speaker 6:  Mobile did 15 years ago and you say, okay, a whole generation

810
00:48:46,085 --> 00:48:49,725
Speaker 6:  of companies died at the hands of these changes and the world

811
00:48:49,725 --> 00:48:53,165
Speaker 6:  changed because of these changes. Like If, you believe that AI is the next

812
00:48:53,185 --> 00:48:56,965
Speaker 6:  one. You kind of have to bet everything right now,

813
00:48:57,035 --> 00:49:00,965
Speaker 6:  even before it's ready because If you don't, you'll, you'll

814
00:49:01,185 --> 00:49:05,005
Speaker 6:  get left behind by the companies that do. That's one

815
00:49:05,005 --> 00:49:08,045
Speaker 6:  side of the bet. The other side of the bet is that at this moment

816
00:49:09,055 --> 00:49:13,005
Speaker 6:  there is nothing about AI and chatbots

817
00:49:13,005 --> 00:49:16,485
Speaker 6:  and this thing that is that important yet. And,

818
00:49:16,785 --> 00:49:19,725
Speaker 6:  and, and so we're in this place where it's, it's still, I think the, like

819
00:49:20,585 --> 00:49:24,125
Speaker 6:  we got that incredible pop of like Oh my God. I cannot believe this thing

820
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:28,045
Speaker 6:  is as good as it is when chat GPT launched. And there

821
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:31,925
Speaker 6:  has not been a moment that has surpassed that since then.

822
00:49:32,455 --> 00:49:35,605
Speaker 6:  Maybe I'm wrong. I, I, I would be curious to know if there are folks who

823
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:38,405
Speaker 6:  feel like we've hit higher highs than that in terms of like,

824
00:49:39,445 --> 00:49:43,205
Speaker 6:  remarkable achievements in ai, but to me it feels like we're still riding

825
00:49:43,275 --> 00:49:47,245
Speaker 6:  that one single high. But If you believe that

826
00:49:47,245 --> 00:49:51,205
Speaker 6:  it is going to be as big and fast and powerful as so many of these

827
00:49:51,205 --> 00:49:53,925
Speaker 6:  people do. You don't have a choice but to bet everything on it, because otherwise

828
00:49:53,925 --> 00:49:57,605
Speaker 6:  you're just dooming your self and your company and your employees to death.

829
00:49:58,115 --> 00:49:58,405
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

830
00:49:59,435 --> 00:50:03,245
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And f fine. I I think all of the big

831
00:50:03,275 --> 00:50:07,245
Speaker 4:  high point moments in AI since then, or at least the ones

832
00:50:07,245 --> 00:50:10,925
Speaker 4:  that have like made the news broadly, like broken into mainstream news,

833
00:50:11,025 --> 00:50:14,285
Speaker 4:  not just this show have been bad. Yeah.

834
00:50:14,285 --> 00:50:15,365
Speaker 6:  They've been failures. Yeah,

835
00:50:15,365 --> 00:50:16,085
Speaker 4:  They've been failures.

836
00:50:16,085 --> 00:50:16,965
Speaker 6:  They've been swaggy popes.

837
00:50:17,235 --> 00:50:20,765
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like, you know, weird, weird woke

838
00:50:21,395 --> 00:50:25,285
Speaker 4:  mind virus controversies. Like fake ones, like just like

839
00:50:25,285 --> 00:50:28,965
Speaker 4:  all over the place. Like barred, just getting dates wrong all over the

840
00:50:28,995 --> 00:50:32,205
Speaker 4:  like. Yeah. The thing that is notable about these systems right now is that

841
00:50:32,205 --> 00:50:36,125
Speaker 4:  they don't know anything. Yep. Right. We're gonna talk about Meta's AI launch

842
00:50:36,125 --> 00:50:40,045
Speaker 4:  this week. I generated a bunch of images of stuff and

843
00:50:40,045 --> 00:50:43,525
Speaker 4:  it just like, doesn't know how clothes move. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, and it's

844
00:50:43,525 --> 00:50:47,485
Speaker 4:  like, oh, this isn't that useful. And that's like,

845
00:50:47,585 --> 00:50:51,165
Speaker 4:  so I just wanna stay there for one second. Like, you're making this bet

846
00:50:51,195 --> 00:50:54,325
Speaker 4:  because you're like, we have to accelerate our, our AI moment.

847
00:50:56,315 --> 00:50:59,325
Speaker 4:  It's still unclear like what that moment looks like in the end. And maybe

848
00:50:59,325 --> 00:51:02,805
Speaker 4:  that the whole point is like, move faster, figure out what's right and what's

849
00:51:02,805 --> 00:51:06,165
Speaker 4:  wrong. Oslo gave you the example of the Pixel camera.

850
00:51:07,675 --> 00:51:08,405
Speaker 4:  Okay, I get it.

851
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:10,845
Speaker 5:  But they've been doing AI stuff with the Pixel camera

852
00:51:11,225 --> 00:51:14,085
Speaker 4:  For a long, but this is his example. Yeah. And he is like, we're gonna do

853
00:51:14,085 --> 00:51:15,045
Speaker 4:  that, but faster. It,

854
00:51:15,065 --> 00:51:18,445
Speaker 5:  It felt a little to me, and, and David maybe correct me if I'm wrong, it

855
00:51:18,445 --> 00:51:22,285
Speaker 5:  felt a little like Silicon Valley in particular is very hyped on

856
00:51:22,425 --> 00:51:25,885
Speaker 5:  ai, right? Like, like there the conversation is what are you doing with ai?

857
00:51:26,025 --> 00:51:29,005
Speaker 5:  If you're not doing something, you're stupid. And a lot of this felt like

858
00:51:29,005 --> 00:51:32,925
Speaker 5:  almost an response to those people being like, yes, we also care about

859
00:51:33,025 --> 00:51:36,285
Speaker 5:  ai. We're at the big, we're we're big. This is our performative moment to

860
00:51:36,285 --> 00:51:39,605
Speaker 5:  tell you that we genuinely believe in this.

861
00:51:40,105 --> 00:51:42,605
Speaker 5:  But it was really for that audience, not necessarily

862
00:51:43,945 --> 00:51:44,285
Speaker 5:  for the,

863
00:51:44,645 --> 00:51:46,965
Speaker 6:  I think that's half right. Like, I think that's exactly right. I think the

864
00:51:46,965 --> 00:51:50,885
Speaker 6:  other audience is investors, right? Yeah. To right now, If, you

865
00:51:50,885 --> 00:51:54,605
Speaker 6:  want to continue to run the company that you run. You have to tell an

866
00:51:54,665 --> 00:51:58,445
Speaker 6:  AI story. You just do. Like, that's, that is where we are. It's,

867
00:51:58,475 --> 00:52:02,405
Speaker 6:  it's what everybody was doing with Mobile 10 years ago

868
00:52:02,405 --> 00:52:06,165
Speaker 6:  is like, If, you didn't have a mobile strategy. What are you doing now?

869
00:52:06,595 --> 00:52:10,205
Speaker 6:  That that thing is ai, right? Like it's, mark Zuckerberg is the perfect example

870
00:52:10,205 --> 00:52:13,045
Speaker 6:  of this. Like, mark doesn't talk about the Metaverse anymore 'cause nobody

871
00:52:13,045 --> 00:52:15,965
Speaker 6:  wants to hear about the Metaverse and they sell shares in Meta when they

872
00:52:15,965 --> 00:52:19,885
Speaker 6:  do. And so now they're telling an AI story and in a lot of ways, the

873
00:52:19,985 --> 00:52:23,285
Speaker 6:  AI story and the Metaverse story actually run together. But they talk about

874
00:52:23,285 --> 00:52:27,205
Speaker 6:  it differently because that is how you win. And you get people excited and

875
00:52:27,205 --> 00:52:30,245
Speaker 6:  you convince them that you are marching towards something huge. So I think

876
00:52:30,245 --> 00:52:34,125
Speaker 6:  you're right. They're, they're telling that sort of same story to two audiences,

877
00:52:34,195 --> 00:52:37,965
Speaker 6:  because without them, they don't have the runway and talent they need to

878
00:52:37,965 --> 00:52:38,525
Speaker 6:  get there at all.

879
00:52:38,915 --> 00:52:40,605
Speaker 4:  Okay. So this was, but the first question,

880
00:52:40,795 --> 00:52:41,445
Speaker 5:  Okay, sorry.

881
00:52:41,705 --> 00:52:44,725
Speaker 4:  Is this the right goal, right? Yes. That's just the first one. And I think

882
00:52:44,725 --> 00:52:47,765
Speaker 4:  the answer is probably yes. Like you have, it has to be the right answer.

883
00:52:47,835 --> 00:52:51,365
Speaker 4:  Yeah. We have to show movement towards this goal. We have to unify

884
00:52:51,365 --> 00:52:55,125
Speaker 4:  Google's famously messy teams, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Google

885
00:52:55,185 --> 00:52:58,845
Speaker 4:  now has Google DeepMind, which itself is a merger of Google

886
00:52:59,015 --> 00:53:02,125
Speaker 4:  Brain and DeepMind, the CEO of that

887
00:53:02,995 --> 00:53:05,725
Speaker 4:  Saba, who's been on decoder. And I asked him, how will this merger work?

888
00:53:05,725 --> 00:53:09,125
Speaker 4:  And he is like, it'll be fine. Recently suddenly comments

889
00:53:09,255 --> 00:53:13,245
Speaker 4:  suggesting he's not so happy with it. So, right. So now you've got

890
00:53:13,485 --> 00:53:17,325
Speaker 4:  Google Research in DeepMind. We'll see how that's going.

891
00:53:17,345 --> 00:53:21,005
Speaker 4:  And then you've got this new group, which

892
00:53:21,705 --> 00:53:25,245
Speaker 4:  you know it from a thousand yards. If, you squint and you're hammered is

893
00:53:25,245 --> 00:53:28,325
Speaker 4:  like, oh, this is, they're doing an Apple. Yeah. They're doing hardware and

894
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:32,285
Speaker 4:  software and services all under one roof to make better

895
00:53:32,645 --> 00:53:33,685
Speaker 4:  complete products. They're

896
00:53:33,685 --> 00:53:36,325
Speaker 5:  Gonna vertically integrate everything. Right? When the FTC is like, Hey,

897
00:53:36,715 --> 00:53:37,005
Speaker 5:  stop

898
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:37,925
Speaker 6:  That. That's perfect tactic.

899
00:53:38,045 --> 00:53:41,165
Speaker 4:  I mean, you do have to be hammered Yeah. To, to make that claim. Like, I

900
00:53:41,165 --> 00:53:44,845
Speaker 4:  don't, but you see it, right? It's like If, you squint, you're like, oh,

901
00:53:44,845 --> 00:53:46,365
Speaker 4:  okay. Then they'll do all the products over here.

902
00:53:47,955 --> 00:53:51,805
Speaker 4:  They still have a Samsung to deal with. Like if Google's like, now the Pixel

903
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:55,285
Speaker 4:  rules, 'cause we made the software custom for the Pixel. Do you want some

904
00:53:55,285 --> 00:53:59,165
Speaker 4:  of this Samsung also? You just announced a bunch of our AI stuff in your

905
00:53:59,165 --> 00:54:01,965
Speaker 4:  phones. How are they gonna manage that?

906
00:54:02,825 --> 00:54:06,685
Speaker 6:  Google is very sensitive to this question. I raised this

907
00:54:06,845 --> 00:54:10,605
Speaker 6:  question to Rick and Hiroshi and the, their response was essentially,

908
00:54:10,985 --> 00:54:14,005
Speaker 6:  no, you're wrong. Everything is fine. The partners love us. Don't even worry

909
00:54:14,005 --> 00:54:17,085
Speaker 6:  about it. I'm paraphrasing, but only, only Justin.

910
00:54:18,425 --> 00:54:19,045
Speaker 6:  But I think,

911
00:54:19,325 --> 00:54:22,365
Speaker 4:  I mean they gave you a quote from the CEO EO of Qualcomm for this story just

912
00:54:22,365 --> 00:54:25,365
Speaker 4:  to be like, see that's like, dude, he sells ships to every, like he doesn't

913
00:54:25,365 --> 00:54:25,885
Speaker 4:  care. That's right.

914
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:26,765
Speaker 6:  That's right.

915
00:54:26,765 --> 00:54:30,405
Speaker 4:  Christian Haman does not care if Google and Samsung are beefing as long as

916
00:54:30,565 --> 00:54:31,685
Speaker 4:  everyone's on phones. Yeah. He's good. It's

917
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:32,765
Speaker 5:  All about the power of Snapdragon.

918
00:54:32,835 --> 00:54:33,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

919
00:54:33,285 --> 00:54:36,165
Speaker 6:  I think there, there are two things going on here. One,

920
00:54:37,325 --> 00:54:41,045
Speaker 6:  I think there's an interesting thing here to

921
00:54:41,045 --> 00:54:45,005
Speaker 6:  compare what Google is doing to actually what Patos Pinene did at Microsoft,

922
00:54:45,975 --> 00:54:49,245
Speaker 6:  which is he was running Surface and then he was running Surface and Windows.

923
00:54:49,785 --> 00:54:53,485
Speaker 6:  And the way that they came to see it was actually what we need to do is we

924
00:54:53,485 --> 00:54:57,405
Speaker 6:  need to make the best Windows PCs and then give what

925
00:54:57,425 --> 00:55:01,165
Speaker 6:  we make back to the ecosystem. So like the Surface team

926
00:55:01,405 --> 00:55:04,885
Speaker 6:  actually pioneered a lot of things that really worked well on Windows. They

927
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:07,685
Speaker 6:  did a lot of work on the handwriting stuff. They did a lot of work on Detachables

928
00:55:07,825 --> 00:55:11,485
Speaker 6:  and then essentially gave that back to partners who were then able to make

929
00:55:11,485 --> 00:55:12,805
Speaker 6:  better Windows PCs as a result.

930
00:55:12,905 --> 00:55:15,325
Speaker 4:  Can I tell you a story about that? Sure. I feel like I can tell the story

931
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:18,405
Speaker 4:  'cause it doesn't work there anymore. Okay. So one of my favorite CS moments,

932
00:55:18,585 --> 00:55:22,565
Speaker 4:  I'm walking around a Microsoft booth with Enos and we're

933
00:55:22,565 --> 00:55:25,165
Speaker 4:  we're talking about that exact concept. What, why do you make these things?

934
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:28,205
Speaker 4:  'cause the surface machines were there and the partner machines were there.

935
00:55:28,205 --> 00:55:30,405
Speaker 4:  And I was like, this has gotta be weird. For You. And he was like, no, no,

936
00:55:30,405 --> 00:55:32,605
Speaker 4:  no. Lemme show you something. Anos was like, no, no. Lemme show you something.

937
00:55:32,605 --> 00:55:36,565
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And he is like, that's my hinge. Mm. And he

938
00:55:36,565 --> 00:55:39,085
Speaker 4:  was appointing at one of the partner machines. He's like, we, that's our

939
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:42,965
Speaker 4:  hinge and that's my displayed blah, blah, blah. Like, he

940
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:46,405
Speaker 4:  was like, this is all our stuff. And like what we're doing, like we are just

941
00:55:46,565 --> 00:55:50,285
Speaker 4:  spending the money to innovate because the e none of these OEMs can out spend

942
00:55:50,295 --> 00:55:54,285
Speaker 4:  Apple. So this is worth it to us. And I asked

943
00:55:54,285 --> 00:55:58,245
Speaker 4:  him for years to give me that story like in a printable way. But

944
00:55:58,245 --> 00:56:00,645
Speaker 4:  obviously none of the partners are gonna be like, that's upon us' Engine.

945
00:56:00,885 --> 00:56:01,325
Speaker 4:  Right? Right.

946
00:56:01,545 --> 00:56:04,205
Speaker 6:  But I think there's something to that, right? And If, you are the company

947
00:56:04,205 --> 00:56:08,005
Speaker 6:  with the resources to feed the ecosystem. You can kind of

948
00:56:08,105 --> 00:56:12,045
Speaker 6:  rising tide, lift all boats that situation. And if you're Google and

949
00:56:12,205 --> 00:56:16,045
Speaker 6:  what you need is for AI to win broadly and for Gemini to

950
00:56:16,045 --> 00:56:19,995
Speaker 6:  win, specifically doing that work on the

951
00:56:19,995 --> 00:56:23,805
Speaker 6:  Pixel and then giving it to Samsung theoretically works for

952
00:56:23,805 --> 00:56:27,445
Speaker 6:  everybody. I I say theoretically because I think Samsung

953
00:56:27,705 --> 00:56:30,405
Speaker 6:  has a long history of not being psyched about Google's

954
00:56:31,845 --> 00:56:35,485
Speaker 6:  situation internally Anyway. Ties in, I guess still

955
00:56:35,485 --> 00:56:39,325
Speaker 6:  exists. I would not bet Samsung is thrilled with this change

956
00:56:39,345 --> 00:56:43,165
Speaker 6:  at Google. But I, I do buy the theory that if Google manages

957
00:56:43,165 --> 00:56:46,885
Speaker 6:  this correctly, it could, it could pull Android

958
00:56:47,105 --> 00:56:49,405
Speaker 6:  AI as a whole along with it.

959
00:56:49,475 --> 00:56:52,445
Speaker 5:  Well, and and you're talking about phones. We've been talking about phones

960
00:56:52,445 --> 00:56:55,285
Speaker 5:  mainly. But it's not just gonna be the phones, right? Like it's gonna be

961
00:56:55,285 --> 00:56:59,205
Speaker 5:  in the TVs and the watches and all the other places too, where Samsung

962
00:56:59,435 --> 00:57:03,205
Speaker 5:  doesn't have as big a, a sharehold. Right?

963
00:57:03,205 --> 00:57:06,725
Speaker 5:  Like Samsung TVs, they sell a lot of TVs mainly to Neli,

964
00:57:07,305 --> 00:57:08,125
Speaker 5:  but no

965
00:57:08,485 --> 00:57:08,965
Speaker 6:  Ties in Baby.

966
00:57:09,965 --> 00:57:13,845
Speaker 4:  I love it. But Oh, that's a good sound. The actually the ties in startup

967
00:57:13,845 --> 00:57:16,645
Speaker 4:  sound on the tv do, do, do. It is like, ooh,

968
00:57:17,035 --> 00:57:18,005
Speaker 6:  Just sounds episode,

969
00:57:18,005 --> 00:57:18,845
Speaker 4:  Episode four.

970
00:57:21,825 --> 00:57:25,085
Speaker 5:  But, but there is all this other stuff. And, and in those cases, like

971
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:28,365
Speaker 5:  yes, this makes a lot of sense, right? Like Android, okay,

972
00:57:28,365 --> 00:57:29,725
Speaker 4:  Let Android give you the counter example.

973
00:57:30,355 --> 00:57:30,645
Speaker 5:  Okay.

974
00:57:31,345 --> 00:57:34,285
Speaker 4:  Let me just before you go off into Android tv 'cause there's nothing I want

975
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:36,605
Speaker 4:  to talk about, more about the raging success of Android tv.

976
00:57:37,195 --> 00:57:38,485
Speaker 5:  It's all you think about. I know

977
00:57:38,865 --> 00:57:42,405
Speaker 4:  Google bought Motorola famously.

978
00:57:42,595 --> 00:57:46,525
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And Andy Rubin, the founder of Android,

979
00:57:46,525 --> 00:57:50,405
Speaker 4:  who worked at Google at that time, was, it is another CS story. He was walking

980
00:57:50,405 --> 00:57:53,485
Speaker 4:  around Cs and he saw how hard Samsung was skinning Android

981
00:57:54,385 --> 00:57:57,965
Speaker 4:  got furious, locked into a battle with Samsung

982
00:57:58,185 --> 00:58:02,085
Speaker 4:  to bring them back into the fold and ruin Android less. Yeah.

983
00:58:02,935 --> 00:58:03,645
Speaker 5:  Touch whiz.

984
00:58:04,065 --> 00:58:07,165
Speaker 4:  And the deal was Google had to sell Motorola

985
00:58:08,025 --> 00:58:11,285
Speaker 4:  to Lenovo. That's what, that was the concession that Samsung

986
00:58:11,515 --> 00:58:14,045
Speaker 4:  extracted to stop it.

987
00:58:15,235 --> 00:58:19,085
Speaker 4:  Like it wasn't because I yelled at them about making bloop bloop sounds and

988
00:58:19,085 --> 00:58:23,045
Speaker 4:  having, making everyone go to the bathroom because of touch whiz. It

989
00:58:23,045 --> 00:58:26,565
Speaker 4:  was because Andy Rubin was like, what are you doing? Yeah, I will sell Motorola

990
00:58:26,665 --> 00:58:30,405
Speaker 4:  and stop competing with you directly. If, you real touch whiz Beckon. That's

991
00:58:30,525 --> 00:58:34,365
Speaker 4:  a lot. Right? And many things have happened since then. We've now,

992
00:58:34,365 --> 00:58:37,485
Speaker 4:  it's called one ui. Like what? It's all different now. Google since then

993
00:58:37,585 --> 00:58:41,525
Speaker 4:  bought the failing HTC turned that into whatever pixels we have now.

994
00:58:41,525 --> 00:58:45,445
Speaker 4:  Like the relationships are different. It seems like the tensions

995
00:58:45,445 --> 00:58:48,645
Speaker 4:  are different, but there is actually history of

996
00:58:49,155 --> 00:58:53,125
Speaker 4:  Samsung being so irritated that Google would compete with it head up

997
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:56,925
Speaker 4:  by buying Motorola, that it started peeling people off and

998
00:58:56,925 --> 00:58:59,205
Speaker 4:  Google had to make the big concession. Yeah.

999
00:58:59,835 --> 00:59:00,125
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

1000
00:59:00,345 --> 00:59:03,205
Speaker 5:  But at the same time, touch was sucked.

1001
00:59:04,235 --> 00:59:06,645
Speaker 5:  Like it was hurting Samsung, wasn't it?

1002
00:59:08,185 --> 00:59:10,165
Speaker 4:  You know, many people,

1003
00:59:10,905 --> 00:59:13,285
Speaker 5:  It was hurting me to look at it. So I just assumed

1004
00:59:13,405 --> 00:59:16,965
Speaker 4:  Famously someone has called this show and insisted that ladies love The Wiz.

1005
00:59:18,075 --> 00:59:20,685
Speaker 4:  This is a real thing that has happened on this show before. I forgot about

1006
00:59:20,685 --> 00:59:24,285
Speaker 4:  that. Big Papa Joe baby. We'll run the clip. We'll, we'll put the clip in

1007
00:59:24,285 --> 00:59:27,005
Speaker 4:  the, in the show notes. That's a real thing that has happened. Yeah. We've

1008
00:59:27,005 --> 00:59:30,925
Speaker 4:  been doing this show for a very long time. Yes. I don't know if

1009
00:59:30,925 --> 00:59:34,045
Speaker 4:  people like touch with or not. I dunno if that was a good idea. I'm just

1010
00:59:34,045 --> 00:59:37,045
Speaker 4:  saying that tension was there. Yeah. And part of the reason Tieszen exists

1011
00:59:37,425 --> 00:59:41,285
Speaker 4:  is because Samsung wanted its own operating system.

1012
00:59:42,105 --> 00:59:45,765
Speaker 4:  It does not want to, it wants to be in control of its future. Right.

1013
00:59:45,945 --> 00:59:49,925
Speaker 4:  and it has this massive dependency on Google and phones. and it did

1014
00:59:49,925 --> 00:59:52,805
Speaker 4:  not want that in TVs it anywhere else. It doesn't want these dependencies

1015
00:59:53,255 --> 00:59:56,325
Speaker 4:  where I I'm just saying, you look at this and you're like, oh, they're, you're,

1016
00:59:56,325 --> 01:00:00,285
Speaker 4:  you know, you do your drunk thousand yard squint Yeah. At

1017
01:00:00,285 --> 01:00:02,725
Speaker 4:  this org chart change. You're like, oh, they're, they're gonna walking right

1018
01:00:02,725 --> 01:00:03,245
Speaker 4:  back into it.

1019
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,485
Speaker 5:  I call that the 2:00 AM Liz Text

1020
01:00:06,285 --> 01:00:06,565
Speaker 4:  Squint.

1021
01:00:07,515 --> 01:00:11,205
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I I think that's right. I guess I think that the thing that is

1022
01:00:11,205 --> 01:00:14,485
Speaker 6:  different from 10 years ago is like, where are you gonna go? Like Samsung

1023
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:18,405
Speaker 6:  knows ties in is not a move at this point.

1024
01:00:19,635 --> 01:00:23,445
Speaker 6:  There's just no, there's no option outside of Android

1025
01:00:23,665 --> 01:00:27,365
Speaker 6:  If. you are a smartphone manufacturer. Samsung, if it made

1026
01:00:27,365 --> 01:00:31,245
Speaker 6:  Android worse or tried to go the the A OSP route and

1027
01:00:31,245 --> 01:00:34,685
Speaker 6:  build their own apps like it, it didn't work last time and it super wouldn't

1028
01:00:34,685 --> 01:00:38,005
Speaker 6:  work this time. Yeah. And the other side is If, you believe

1029
01:00:38,395 --> 01:00:42,155
Speaker 6:  that AI is the thing you need Google more than ever

1030
01:00:42,155 --> 01:00:45,955
Speaker 6:  because like Samsung has been way out in front of

1031
01:00:45,955 --> 01:00:49,435
Speaker 6:  promoting Gemini, it's getting a lot of these Gemini features ahead of pixels

1032
01:00:49,455 --> 01:00:53,315
Speaker 6:  in some cases. Like, I, I think if, if You believe in the AI

1033
01:00:53,515 --> 01:00:57,395
Speaker 6:  revolution, Samsung is actually sort of forced to increase its

1034
01:00:57,395 --> 01:01:00,395
Speaker 6:  dependency on Google, not try to get away from it.

1035
01:01:00,915 --> 01:01:04,755
Speaker 5:  I mean, what if they end up going with like Harmony os or whatever Huawei's

1036
01:01:06,345 --> 01:01:07,955
Speaker 5:  operating system is on, right? Like,

1037
01:01:08,005 --> 01:01:09,955
Speaker 6:  How's that, how's that going for, for them in the us?

1038
01:01:10,585 --> 01:01:14,515
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Not great, but you like, I don't know. I I, I think I don't

1039
01:01:14,515 --> 01:01:17,595
Speaker 5:  wanna just immediately say they're, they're totally locked into Android.

1040
01:01:17,875 --> 01:01:21,755
Speaker 5:  Although they, they very much are. I think there is like options available

1041
01:01:21,815 --> 01:01:23,275
Speaker 5:  to them, especially as we have this,

1042
01:01:23,635 --> 01:01:26,835
Speaker 6:  I say this in all sincerity. Make me a list of those options. Yeah.

1043
01:01:26,905 --> 01:01:29,995
Speaker 5:  It's, it's Harmony os they're just gonna go all in on the Chinese market.

1044
01:01:30,185 --> 01:01:32,595
Speaker 4:  This is why you need middleware and super apps.

1045
01:01:35,535 --> 01:01:36,315
Speaker 5:  You got us there.

1046
01:01:36,425 --> 01:01:40,235
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It was coming inevitably. Yeah. All right. I I'm exci

1047
01:01:40,415 --> 01:01:44,275
Speaker 4:  I'm hopeful for a more focused faster Google. That's what Rick

1048
01:01:44,275 --> 01:01:46,475
Speaker 4:  is saying he wants to do. He wants to move everything faster. He wants to

1049
01:01:46,475 --> 01:01:50,035
Speaker 4:  shit more things. I, I think the best thing Google could do would to

1050
01:01:50,705 --> 01:01:54,275
Speaker 4:  kill even more products actually right now, just do remember reduce the number

1051
01:01:54,275 --> 01:01:57,475
Speaker 4:  of Google products by half and then loudly announced that it will just keep

1052
01:01:57,475 --> 01:02:01,315
Speaker 4:  iterating those products for five years. That'd be cool. That would be a

1053
01:02:01,315 --> 01:02:01,915
Speaker 4:  huge change.

1054
01:02:02,215 --> 01:02:06,075
Speaker 6:  Do you remember in like 2011 when Larry Page came back as CEO and

1055
01:02:06,135 --> 01:02:10,075
Speaker 6:  he did, I think it was on an investor call,

1056
01:02:10,075 --> 01:02:13,635
Speaker 6:  said the, he gave the whole like more wood behind fewer arrows speech. And

1057
01:02:13,635 --> 01:02:16,595
Speaker 6:  then Google promptly killed a whole bunch of stuff that it had been working

1058
01:02:17,825 --> 01:02:21,725
Speaker 6:  on. Like this is just the Google cycle, right? They're like, they

1059
01:02:21,825 --> 01:02:25,525
Speaker 6:  realize, oh, we're not making enough money and or the world is changing.

1060
01:02:25,525 --> 01:02:28,845
Speaker 6:  The first time it was about Google Plus was like, we're gonna reorient everything

1061
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:32,245
Speaker 6:  around social, which went super great and that's why we all use Google Plus

1062
01:02:33,555 --> 01:02:36,245
Speaker 6:  now. It's just the same thing again, right? Like Google sort of lets, its

1063
01:02:36,525 --> 01:02:40,485
Speaker 6:  company sprawl lets everything get weird hires, lots of people builds a million

1064
01:02:40,485 --> 01:02:43,645
Speaker 6:  messaging apps. And then at some point you go, oh, this is actually making

1065
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:47,885
Speaker 6:  us interesting, but it's making us slow and we have to all point in one

1066
01:02:47,985 --> 01:02:51,365
Speaker 6:  direction now. And that's what you do when you have to point in one direction.

1067
01:02:51,365 --> 01:02:54,125
Speaker 6:  And for Google that one direction is very much ai. Like, they made a couple

1068
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:57,925
Speaker 6:  of other little org changes today as part of this

1069
01:02:58,165 --> 01:03:01,605
Speaker 6:  announcement at DeepMind in Google research and elsewhere. And like Sundar

1070
01:03:01,635 --> 01:03:04,845
Speaker 6:  Phai in particular is very clear that the message is like, move faster and

1071
01:03:04,845 --> 01:03:08,085
Speaker 6:  move towards ai. Like that is Google's job for the foreseeable future.

1072
01:03:08,865 --> 01:03:09,435
Speaker 6:  Will it work?

1073
01:03:10,965 --> 01:03:14,665
Speaker 6:  Yes. Because Google is a famously well run company with a culture and structure.

1074
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:15,585
Speaker 6:  That makes total sense.

1075
01:03:15,805 --> 01:03:18,145
Speaker 4:  All right, well Google IO is coming up next month. Yeah,

1076
01:03:18,145 --> 01:03:18,705
Speaker 6:  That's right. Yep.

1077
01:03:19,085 --> 01:03:22,545
Speaker 4:  And I anticipate we will, I we end up talking to all of these folks at IO

1078
01:03:22,545 --> 01:03:25,865
Speaker 4:  every year. So we, we will just see how it's going. We're like one month

1079
01:03:25,865 --> 01:03:26,385
Speaker 4:  in, did it work?

1080
01:03:28,055 --> 01:03:29,345
Speaker 5:  Just stare really hard. And

1081
01:03:29,345 --> 01:03:32,465
Speaker 6:  Then AI sued our phai. We'll say, yes it did. And then that'll be it all.

1082
01:03:32,645 --> 01:03:36,545
Speaker 4:  You know, I, we have Meta is competing with chat JPT on our list.

1083
01:03:36,545 --> 01:03:40,505
Speaker 4:  Here they are. They announced AI products. It's, they're everywhere. You

1084
01:03:40,505 --> 01:03:44,145
Speaker 4:  can chat with a Meta AI on literally any Meta surface. You can think of

1085
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:47,065
Speaker 4:  Instagram, WhatsApp for some reason. Have you done

1086
01:03:47,065 --> 01:03:47,225
Speaker 5:  That?

1087
01:03:48,085 --> 01:03:51,905
Speaker 4:  No. I, I have gone directly to Meta dot ai. Oh. And only

1088
01:03:51,955 --> 01:03:55,025
Speaker 4:  asked to produce images of Jesus made of spaghetti.

1089
01:03:58,565 --> 01:03:58,785
Speaker 4:  The

1090
01:03:58,785 --> 01:03:59,585
Speaker 6:  True correct use.

1091
01:03:59,805 --> 01:04:03,665
Speaker 4:  Yes. Which it won't do it, it will not produce any

1092
01:04:03,985 --> 01:04:07,425
Speaker 4:  religious iconography. If, you ask it to produce images of a Middle Eastern

1093
01:04:07,485 --> 01:04:10,985
Speaker 4:  man from ancient times made of spaghetti. It will happily do that.

1094
01:04:11,445 --> 01:04:13,305
Speaker 6:  Oh, but it's not Jesus per se.

1095
01:04:14,585 --> 01:04:16,065
Speaker 4:  I, you know, you can, it's

1096
01:04:16,065 --> 01:04:16,865
Speaker 5:  Open to interpretation.

1097
01:04:16,965 --> 01:04:20,865
Speaker 4:  You can get to a, a state, you can prompt

1098
01:04:21,225 --> 01:04:24,705
Speaker 4:  engineer your way into something that I believe is, we can

1099
01:04:24,705 --> 01:04:25,465
Speaker 6:  Look more jesusy.

1100
01:04:28,805 --> 01:04:32,225
Speaker 4:  So the reason I, I mentioned this just to point out, this has been going

1101
01:04:32,225 --> 01:04:36,065
Speaker 4:  on for months now. Crazy AI generated images are

1102
01:04:36,065 --> 01:04:39,985
Speaker 4:  constantly going viral on Facebook. The last one, I think

1103
01:04:39,985 --> 01:04:43,625
Speaker 4:  our friends at Hard Fork covered it. Jesus is a crab,

1104
01:04:44,175 --> 01:04:46,625
Speaker 4:  just like hundreds of thousands of likes. Was there a shrimp?

1105
01:04:47,815 --> 01:04:49,865
Speaker 4:  There's crab and shrimp. Oh, there's crab and

1106
01:04:50,205 --> 01:04:53,385
Speaker 6:  And shrimp. Oh, I got deep into shrimp. Jesus. I totally miss crab. Yeah.

1107
01:04:53,385 --> 01:04:56,825
Speaker 4:  I think hard fork was shrimp. Jesus. But there's also, you know, cartonization

1108
01:04:56,825 --> 01:04:59,905
Speaker 4:  is like a real phenomenon and evolution where everything turns into a crab.

1109
01:04:59,905 --> 01:05:03,465
Speaker 4:  and it has been true of AI generated Jesus as well

1110
01:05:03,845 --> 01:05:07,745
Speaker 4:  on these platforms. And then the one that just killed me,

1111
01:05:08,255 --> 01:05:12,065
Speaker 4:  it's a quick post on this. I wrote it, you can go into it. The images

1112
01:05:12,285 --> 01:05:15,145
Speaker 4:  of Jesus made of spaghetti on the Lambo also made of spaghetti.

1113
01:05:15,145 --> 01:05:16,025
Speaker 5:  Oh my God. It was so good.

1114
01:05:16,765 --> 01:05:20,685
Speaker 4:  The last one I saw had 36,000 likes. Oh my God. It's

1115
01:05:20,685 --> 01:05:24,445
Speaker 4:  very good. And I, you know, if Meta is gonna release AI tools, we gotta see

1116
01:05:24,445 --> 01:05:25,845
Speaker 4:  if we can just close the loop. Yeah.

1117
01:05:27,585 --> 01:05:31,565
Speaker 4:  And the, the answer is no, actually that spaghetti Jesus on a

1118
01:05:31,565 --> 01:05:34,405
Speaker 4:  Lambo is not nearly as good as the ones that are currently on Meta other

1119
01:05:34,845 --> 01:05:38,765
Speaker 4:  platforms. So whatever tool the spams are using a little bit

1120
01:05:38,775 --> 01:05:41,885
Speaker 4:  ahead of Meta's tools currently. I like

1121
01:05:41,885 --> 01:05:44,245
Speaker 6:  That. That's, that's good for them. Meta some work to do. Meta should always

1122
01:05:44,245 --> 01:05:47,605
Speaker 6:  be a little bit behind its own users. That feels right. I do think it's interesting

1123
01:05:47,605 --> 01:05:50,765
Speaker 6:  though that part of this also Meta released Lama three, which is the new

1124
01:05:50,765 --> 01:05:54,285
Speaker 6:  version of its own LLM. and it seems

1125
01:05:54,545 --> 01:05:57,565
Speaker 6:  in a very real way, like we have a pretty strong

1126
01:05:58,275 --> 01:06:02,205
Speaker 6:  sort of four party race right now between Claude from Anthropic,

1127
01:06:03,285 --> 01:06:07,245
Speaker 6:  GPT, whatever, Gemini, and now Llama

1128
01:06:07,425 --> 01:06:11,285
Speaker 6:  to be like the model. We're in this space where

1129
01:06:11,285 --> 01:06:13,885
Speaker 6:  it's like, it feels like computer chips from a million years ago when like

1130
01:06:14,175 --> 01:06:17,365
Speaker 6:  every subsequent one that comes out every two weeks is like a little bit

1131
01:06:17,365 --> 01:06:21,205
Speaker 6:  faster and just the, the sort of speed and success

1132
01:06:21,205 --> 01:06:24,845
Speaker 6:  is going up really fast. But these four companies are all like deep in it.

1133
01:06:24,845 --> 01:06:28,725
Speaker 6:  They have a ton of money, they're very invested. and it is, it is kind of

1134
01:06:28,725 --> 01:06:29,645
Speaker 6:  happening really fast.

1135
01:06:30,275 --> 01:06:34,205
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Although I don't know that it's quite like computer chips and

1136
01:06:34,205 --> 01:06:38,165
Speaker 4:  that they are all bad in different

1137
01:06:38,165 --> 01:06:42,125
Speaker 4:  ways. Fair. Right. Like as chatbots, Molly White,

1138
01:06:42,185 --> 01:06:45,365
Speaker 4:  who writes Web3 is going just scrape. She just had a newsletter that she's

1139
01:06:45,365 --> 01:06:48,525
Speaker 4:  like, I'm kind of interested in this. Like I, I'm more positive around the

1140
01:06:48,525 --> 01:06:51,005
Speaker 4:  people think given how she feels or cryptocurrency will link to the newsletter

1141
01:06:51,005 --> 01:06:53,965
Speaker 4:  as well. But she's like, I asked it to write this newsletter and she has

1142
01:06:53,965 --> 01:06:57,845
Speaker 4:  all the results of all the four. And she's like, the thing about them is

1143
01:06:57,925 --> 01:07:01,365
Speaker 4:  I told it to write like me. and it just is scolding you. Like they, they

1144
01:07:01,365 --> 01:07:04,525
Speaker 4:  write like angry school teachers I think was her phrase. And it's like, that's

1145
01:07:04,525 --> 01:07:08,045
Speaker 4:  the thing. Like it, they can generate

1146
01:07:08,275 --> 01:07:08,565
Speaker 4:  copy.

1147
01:07:10,785 --> 01:07:14,485
Speaker 4:  Is there a reliable way for anyone to say whether the copy

1148
01:07:14,585 --> 01:07:18,005
Speaker 4:  is generated is getting better or worse even within a single model?

1149
01:07:18,745 --> 01:07:18,965
Speaker 4:  Or,

1150
01:07:19,925 --> 01:07:22,885
Speaker 5:  I mean, is it between them as a critic and an editor? Yes,

1151
01:07:23,745 --> 01:07:24,805
Speaker 5:  but don don't wanna read it all.

1152
01:07:25,025 --> 01:07:28,565
Speaker 4:  But you look at like four columns of like middling work and you're like,

1153
01:07:28,705 --> 01:07:30,365
Speaker 4:  aren't I gonna rank these? Yeah.

1154
01:07:30,365 --> 01:07:30,845
Speaker 5:  They're

1155
01:07:30,845 --> 01:07:33,285
Speaker 4:  All garbage. All of you get D minuses. Like get outta here.

1156
01:07:33,635 --> 01:07:36,485
Speaker 6:  Well, in that way it's actually kind of an interesting parallel to the computer

1157
01:07:36,495 --> 01:07:39,725
Speaker 6:  chips thing because we're in the, we're in the phase where they're all passing

1158
01:07:40,155 --> 01:07:43,925
Speaker 6:  benchmark tests with increasingly impressive scores that don't mean much

1159
01:07:43,945 --> 01:07:47,645
Speaker 6:  to real people yet. Yeah. And the question is like, is anyone

1160
01:07:47,925 --> 01:07:51,525
Speaker 6:  actually going to make real use of the sort of raw capability of this stuff

1161
01:07:51,795 --> 01:07:55,605
Speaker 6:  that means anything to anybody? And so far I, the answer

1162
01:07:55,625 --> 01:07:57,645
Speaker 6:  is largely not really. Yeah.

1163
01:07:57,745 --> 01:08:01,725
Speaker 4:  But I do think one interesting piece of the Meta puzzle at

1164
01:08:01,725 --> 01:08:05,645
Speaker 4:  least is it has massive distribution and is 0% afraid of

1165
01:08:05,645 --> 01:08:09,445
Speaker 4:  using it. Yeah. Yep. Like If, you use a Meta product. Boy

1166
01:08:09,465 --> 01:08:12,605
Speaker 4:  is there AI next to you now it's just happening. It's just here it is.

1167
01:08:13,195 --> 01:08:16,125
Speaker 4:  Just talking to you. Am Meta's AI showed up in a Facebook group for people

1168
01:08:16,275 --> 01:08:20,045
Speaker 4:  with gifted and disabled children made up a child It had and said it was

1169
01:08:20,045 --> 01:08:23,805
Speaker 4:  very happy in the New York City public schools. Oh no. Yeah. That's

1170
01:08:24,085 --> 01:08:27,925
Speaker 4:  just a thing. And someone said, is this Black Mirror and AI responded? No,

1171
01:08:27,925 --> 01:08:31,805
Speaker 4:  it's not. It's just me. Meta ai That's a, it was like a story

1172
01:08:31,805 --> 01:08:35,765
Speaker 4:  in 4 0 4, which we also link many links. Links to everyone. I'm

1173
01:08:35,765 --> 01:08:38,805
Speaker 4:  just saying the most notable stuff about this air. And I was like, when it's

1174
01:08:38,805 --> 01:08:39,845
Speaker 4:  going it's a little sideways. Yeah.

1175
01:08:40,315 --> 01:08:44,045
Speaker 5:  It's, I mean they've, they've gotten really, really good at making machines

1176
01:08:44,045 --> 01:08:45,845
Speaker 5:  that are impressive at confidently lying.

1177
01:08:46,355 --> 01:08:46,645
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1178
01:08:46,945 --> 01:08:47,445
Speaker 5:  And that's

1179
01:08:47,585 --> 01:08:49,525
Speaker 4:  The goal. I mean, they've always been the goal. Yeah. Like

1180
01:08:49,595 --> 01:08:53,245
Speaker 5:  Just go put a little suit on it and have it run for office. Like it's got

1181
01:08:53,245 --> 01:08:53,525
Speaker 5:  it down

1182
01:08:53,595 --> 01:08:56,285
Speaker 4:  Finally. Yeah. Finally a president. I can get you behind. Yeah.

1183
01:08:57,165 --> 01:08:57,605
Speaker 5:  Llama three.

1184
01:08:57,915 --> 01:08:59,245
Speaker 4:  It's like, I'm shrimp. Jesus.

1185
01:09:01,665 --> 01:09:02,805
Speaker 4:  I'm proud to be an American.

1186
01:09:04,505 --> 01:09:06,285
Speaker 4:  That's enough. AI talk. Let's talk about the real thing.

1187
01:09:08,115 --> 01:09:09,325
Speaker 4:  Mini LED televisions.

1188
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:11,405
Speaker 5:  Yeah, we got the tv.

1189
01:09:11,755 --> 01:09:15,285
Speaker 4:  It's, it's been heavy man. Sorry David. Policy updates. There's been

1190
01:09:15,445 --> 01:09:18,125
Speaker 4:  Europeans AI stands for awesome interpolation.

1191
01:09:20,305 --> 01:09:23,525
Speaker 4:  All right. So Sony, this is like the most important story of the year.

1192
01:09:24,505 --> 01:09:27,205
Speaker 5:  I'm with you for now. Until next week.

1193
01:09:29,065 --> 01:09:31,605
Speaker 4:  I'm telling you there's a revolution in TVs happening.

1194
01:09:33,755 --> 01:09:34,845
Speaker 4:  Just lock in.

1195
01:09:36,025 --> 01:09:39,085
Speaker 5:  All the TV makers are like Neil. I gets it. Yeah.

1196
01:09:39,435 --> 01:09:43,365
Speaker 4:  Because I do. So at CSS last year we saw

1197
01:09:43,365 --> 01:09:46,885
Speaker 4:  a bunch of mini led D televisions. I confidently predicted that many LEDs

1198
01:09:47,015 --> 01:09:49,965
Speaker 4:  would bring prices down and people would start buying bigger TVs.

1199
01:09:50,795 --> 01:09:53,205
Speaker 4:  There's a little bit of data's worth, there's a little bit of data about

1200
01:09:53,205 --> 01:09:56,365
Speaker 4:  some other thing that I'll talk about in a second. Sony has started skipping

1201
01:09:56,465 --> 01:10:00,325
Speaker 4:  cs. They've done it for years. They announced their TVs this year. Sony

1202
01:10:01,425 --> 01:10:05,365
Speaker 4:  slowly pulling back for mullets, which is really

1203
01:10:05,685 --> 01:10:09,605
Speaker 4:  interesting. So the oled, I have the A 95 L

1204
01:10:09,985 --> 01:10:13,885
Speaker 4:  QD OLED ola, very bright, very colorful. They're just

1205
01:10:14,205 --> 01:10:17,405
Speaker 4:  sticking around. No updates to the flagship OLED in the SO line.

1206
01:10:17,665 --> 01:10:17,885
Speaker 5:  Wow.

1207
01:10:19,065 --> 01:10:22,605
Speaker 4:  All of the flagship TVs are mini LED TVs. They're the

1208
01:10:22,745 --> 01:10:23,645
Speaker 4:  bravia nines.

1209
01:10:25,395 --> 01:10:28,445
Speaker 4:  Sony won't tell you how many backlight zones they have. They'll just tell

1210
01:10:28,445 --> 01:10:32,005
Speaker 4:  you increasing percentages. Incredible chart. They're just like

1211
01:10:32,005 --> 01:10:35,725
Speaker 4:  325% and more dimming zones.

1212
01:10:36,035 --> 01:10:36,645
Speaker 5:  Just more,

1213
01:10:38,035 --> 01:10:38,725
Speaker 4:  Just more.

1214
01:10:38,815 --> 01:10:40,125
Speaker 5:  Don't worry about it. It's just a lot.

1215
01:10:42,305 --> 01:10:46,125
Speaker 4:  So I've seen, and that's three 25% more than last year's X 95 L which

1216
01:10:46,125 --> 01:10:49,725
Speaker 4:  I've seen, which is a beautiful TV that only if you're paying attention to,

1217
01:10:50,025 --> 01:10:53,285
Speaker 4:  do you see any blooming? Now it's brighter. There's

1218
01:10:53,285 --> 01:10:56,925
Speaker 4:  325% more zones. I'm anticipating that there will be no

1219
01:10:56,925 --> 01:11:00,805
Speaker 4:  blooming or it'll be even harder to see. Which means you can now

1220
01:11:00,865 --> 01:11:04,205
Speaker 4:  get gigantic super bright

1221
01:11:04,605 --> 01:11:08,485
Speaker 4:  LED bright TV with the black levels of OLED without the burning

1222
01:11:08,485 --> 01:11:09,045
Speaker 4:  problems.

1223
01:11:10,145 --> 01:11:10,845
Speaker 5:  How much is that

1224
01:11:10,845 --> 01:11:14,685
Speaker 4:  Cost? And, and it's better for gaming 'cause it's faster refresh of

1225
01:11:14,835 --> 01:11:15,125
Speaker 4:  LEDs.

1226
01:11:15,275 --> 01:11:19,005
Speaker 5:  Yeah, no, i, I totally am all for that. and it was someone with a

1227
01:11:19,005 --> 01:11:22,965
Speaker 5:  2017 oled. Really? You cannot understand how much I'm

1228
01:11:22,965 --> 01:11:23,565
Speaker 5:  all for that. Oh,

1229
01:11:23,635 --> 01:11:26,685
Speaker 4:  It's also 50% brighter than the X 95. I'm just telling you. But how

1230
01:11:26,685 --> 01:11:27,005
Speaker 5:  Much is it?

1231
01:11:27,035 --> 01:11:30,365
Speaker 4:  They're not, they're not like a, a number. That's good.

1232
01:11:31,745 --> 01:11:35,645
Speaker 6:  No ne Neil tell the people, tell the people what is the cheapest one of

1233
01:11:35,645 --> 01:11:36,165
Speaker 6:  these cost?

1234
01:11:36,905 --> 01:11:40,765
Speaker 4:  The the 65 inch is 32 9 9, which is

1235
01:11:40,895 --> 01:11:43,485
Speaker 4:  not outta whack with top end OLEDs. Let's top

1236
01:11:43,505 --> 01:11:45,845
Speaker 6:  End. Let's, let's just, can I just say that? Can I just say that price number

1237
01:11:46,085 --> 01:11:48,005
Speaker 6:  slightly differently? Yeah. It costs

1238
01:11:48,005 --> 01:11:51,165
Speaker 6:  $3,299 and 99 cents.

1239
01:11:51,165 --> 01:11:51,765
Speaker 4:  If you're like sitting there,

1240
01:11:51,765 --> 01:11:55,445
Speaker 6:  32 99 is like, oh, 33 bucks. That's what a normal

1241
01:11:55,455 --> 01:11:56,485
Speaker 6:  TV costs now. No,

1242
01:11:56,485 --> 01:11:59,525
Speaker 4:  No. You're gonna have to stay on the wall for 10 years. If you're out there

1243
01:11:59,525 --> 01:12:02,685
Speaker 4:  cross shopping an LG G three, you're like, oh, that's interesting.

1244
01:12:03,185 --> 01:12:04,685
Speaker 4:  That's all I'm saying. Yeah. You're

1245
01:12:04,685 --> 01:12:08,125
Speaker 6:  Gonna have it on your wall for two years and then Neli Patel is gonna come

1246
01:12:08,125 --> 01:12:11,805
Speaker 6:  on The Vergecast in 2025 and say, listen everybody, there's

1247
01:12:11,805 --> 01:12:14,245
Speaker 6:  another 325% increase. Well,

1248
01:12:14,245 --> 01:12:18,125
Speaker 4:  So here's the problem. So the A 95 only goes up to 77 inches and

1249
01:12:18,585 --> 01:12:21,485
Speaker 4:  the top end braa nines are 85 inches.

1250
01:12:21,485 --> 01:12:22,245
Speaker 5:  That's so much tv,

1251
01:12:22,295 --> 01:12:25,965
Speaker 4:  Which is $5,499. I just bought this TV last

1252
01:12:26,245 --> 01:12:30,085
Speaker 4:  September. Like, what am I doing? It's a, this is bad.

1253
01:12:30,085 --> 01:12:33,845
Speaker 4:  Like I have to send her to college. Right. you know, like that's gonna be

1254
01:12:33,845 --> 01:12:36,445
Speaker 4:  a couple days of college by the time she's ready to go to college.

1255
01:12:37,185 --> 01:12:38,365
Speaker 6:  That's like some textbooks.

1256
01:12:38,685 --> 01:12:40,405
Speaker 5:  Yeah. A single textbook. Yeah.

1257
01:12:40,405 --> 01:12:42,925
Speaker 4:  You get 24 hours in the storm kid. I bought a new tv.

1258
01:12:46,505 --> 01:12:50,165
Speaker 4:  I'm just saying these TVs represent a huge

1259
01:12:50,215 --> 01:12:54,165
Speaker 4:  shift from Ed in this market. Yeah. This

1260
01:12:54,165 --> 01:12:57,165
Speaker 4:  is when it's starting to happen. And that, I think that means the rest of

1261
01:12:57,165 --> 01:13:00,325
Speaker 4:  the TVs are gonna get cheaper. Like these are the crazy top ends that are

1262
01:13:00,405 --> 01:13:03,685
Speaker 4:  supposed to compete with the high end eds. They have insane features. They,

1263
01:13:05,255 --> 01:13:08,885
Speaker 4:  we've we're so far from the motion smoothing debate. Generally

1264
01:13:09,355 --> 01:13:13,165
Speaker 4:  like regular, you know, regular people TVs, you still have to turn off motion

1265
01:13:13,165 --> 01:13:17,085
Speaker 4:  smoothing at the high end of the market. Now the TVs have built

1266
01:13:17,105 --> 01:13:21,045
Speaker 4:  in calibrated modes for the services where the services can calibrate

1267
01:13:21,045 --> 01:13:24,445
Speaker 4:  your TV for whatever they're streaming. So Prime video

1268
01:13:24,885 --> 01:13:28,845
Speaker 4:  calibrated on the new Sony Bravia Nines will know if

1269
01:13:28,845 --> 01:13:31,925
Speaker 4:  you're watching a movie or you're watching Monday Night Football and recalibrate

1270
01:13:31,925 --> 01:13:32,925
Speaker 4:  the tv For You automatically.

1271
01:13:33,025 --> 01:13:34,005
Speaker 5:  But that'll only work.

1272
01:13:34,625 --> 01:13:34,965
Speaker 4:  If. you

1273
01:13:34,985 --> 01:13:37,725
Speaker 5:  Use use this the smart TV function they have. Oh,

1274
01:13:38,475 --> 01:13:39,845
Speaker 4:  It's gonna be not talk with the details.

1275
01:13:41,865 --> 01:13:45,725
Speaker 4:  If. you wanna run Bravia core and stream at 80 megabits per second. You gotta

1276
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:46,845
Speaker 6:  Look so tight.

1277
01:13:47,505 --> 01:13:49,285
Speaker 5:  You gotta, you gotta make some sacrifices.

1278
01:13:49,345 --> 01:13:53,045
Speaker 4:  By the way, there's some debate in the comments of Chris Welch's story about

1279
01:13:53,045 --> 01:13:56,165
Speaker 4:  this, about whether it's called Bravia Core or Sony Pictures core.

1280
01:13:57,365 --> 01:14:01,285
Speaker 4:  I just, lemme just clear it up. It's only a Bravia core and Bravia TVs

1281
01:14:01,285 --> 01:14:05,165
Speaker 4:  were the only place the platform supports 80 megabits per

1282
01:14:05,165 --> 01:14:08,525
Speaker 4:  second Purestream. Everywhere else it's Sony picture score and it doesn't

1283
01:14:08,525 --> 01:14:10,005
Speaker 4:  have the one feature. That's good. Mm.

1284
01:14:10,145 --> 01:14:12,005
Speaker 6:  So Sony Pictures is the bad one.

1285
01:14:12,355 --> 01:14:16,125
Speaker 4:  Sony picture score is like, what if we made a not good streaming service

1286
01:14:16,195 --> 01:14:19,525
Speaker 4:  with a small cat? Like what if we made a streaming service where you opened

1287
01:14:19,525 --> 01:14:22,445
Speaker 4:  it and it was like, Mme. Webb is the thing. We got this

1288
01:14:24,675 --> 01:14:25,725
Speaker 5:  Just you turn it off.

1289
01:14:26,275 --> 01:14:29,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I just didn't, I didn't redeem my credits for Madam Web.

1290
01:14:30,465 --> 01:14:34,325
Speaker 6:  No, I will say Sony does a thing that I appreciate, which is they

1291
01:14:34,325 --> 01:14:38,165
Speaker 6:  just, they make the TV that is just the

1292
01:14:38,165 --> 01:14:41,765
Speaker 6:  DOPE TV and they're like, whatever it costs no problem. But like

1293
01:14:41,875 --> 01:14:45,725
Speaker 6:  this 5,501 is enormous. It has, what was it called? Like

1294
01:14:45,965 --> 01:14:49,405
Speaker 6:  X wide angle for the viewing angle stuff. It has amazing

1295
01:14:49,445 --> 01:14:53,085
Speaker 6:  speakers. It's like I just, Sony does the thing that I like where they're

1296
01:14:53,085 --> 01:14:56,325
Speaker 6:  like, here is the luxury version and we are just going to slowly make that

1297
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:59,925
Speaker 6:  one cheaper over time. And someday in

1298
01:15:00,065 --> 01:15:03,925
Speaker 6:  2061, I will own this exact TV in my house

1299
01:15:04,025 --> 01:15:05,085
Speaker 6:  and I can't look, I can't,

1300
01:15:05,355 --> 01:15:09,205
Speaker 4:  It's gonna take a long time. So the, the, that's the Brav nine, the top

1301
01:15:09,235 --> 01:15:12,605
Speaker 4:  ends. So the flagship Sony TVs this year are mini LEDs and

1302
01:15:13,025 --> 01:15:16,685
Speaker 4:  my A 95, which we'll just soldier on. Yeah. Well,

1303
01:15:16,685 --> 01:15:18,885
Speaker 5:  I mean that, that's good though because you don't have, do you have regret

1304
01:15:18,885 --> 01:15:20,525
Speaker 5:  buying it? Do you have the fomo?

1305
01:15:21,285 --> 01:15:22,165
Speaker 4:  I don't want to say it this time

1306
01:15:23,915 --> 01:15:27,605
Speaker 4:  then the, the one step down, the brav eights are regular

1307
01:15:27,925 --> 01:15:31,765
Speaker 4:  OLEDs, not the cutie OLEDs that I have in the A 95. They've got all the same

1308
01:15:31,765 --> 01:15:35,565
Speaker 4:  stuff. But you can just see Sony is like their biggest

1309
01:15:35,675 --> 01:15:38,685
Speaker 4:  best. Their push is many LEDs. I think the resting industry will follow them.

1310
01:15:39,325 --> 01:15:42,765
Speaker 4:  Then there's actually cheaper many LED D TVs. They don't have all the stuff.

1311
01:15:44,645 --> 01:15:46,565
Speaker 5:  I think you use cheaper generously here.

1312
01:15:47,795 --> 01:15:49,125
Speaker 6:  It's a very relative term,

1313
01:15:49,425 --> 01:15:52,885
Speaker 4:  $2,300 for a 65 inch man set is like,

1314
01:15:53,235 --> 01:15:57,205
Speaker 4:  that is as good as the X 95 is dead on competitive with an ola. Do

1315
01:15:57,205 --> 01:15:58,245
Speaker 4:  you with a high end Ola? I

1316
01:15:58,245 --> 01:16:02,125
Speaker 5:  Think I, I need to just one in my house next to my 2017

1317
01:16:02,525 --> 01:16:06,045
Speaker 5:  Ola to see which is better. I gotta like get 'em next to each other. Yeah.

1318
01:16:06,045 --> 01:16:07,085
Speaker 5:  And see if it's truly better.

1319
01:16:07,185 --> 01:16:10,885
Speaker 4:  All right. So I will end my, I know gushing over Sony television, which I

1320
01:16:10,885 --> 01:16:13,565
Speaker 4:  haven't seen. I don't know, I don't know if these are as good as I want them

1321
01:16:13,565 --> 01:16:17,165
Speaker 4:  to be. I don't know what 325% more dimming zones mean. I don't know if these

1322
01:16:17,355 --> 01:16:21,205
Speaker 4:  auto calibrated modes that require to use their weird software that

1323
01:16:21,395 --> 01:16:24,965
Speaker 4:  basically tries to like ransom you into enabling samba

1324
01:16:24,965 --> 01:16:28,805
Speaker 4:  interactive tv, which washes your every move like a hawk

1325
01:16:28,805 --> 01:16:32,725
Speaker 4:  to sell it to some snarling data. Bro, I, I don't know. All right. That's

1326
01:16:32,725 --> 01:16:34,765
Speaker 4:  all just there. I'm just saying picture quality wise, you can see what's

1327
01:16:34,765 --> 01:16:38,445
Speaker 4:  happening in this market. Yeah. Next to that is the fucking Frame

1328
01:16:38,585 --> 01:16:42,485
Speaker 4:  tv, which is like dominating the charts. And I just

1329
01:16:42,485 --> 01:16:45,885
Speaker 4:  wanna tell this story about the rudest text. You can sell, send me po the

1330
01:16:45,905 --> 01:16:49,365
Speaker 4:  rudest text I've ever received. And I feel comfortable saying this 'cause

1331
01:16:49,365 --> 01:16:51,245
Speaker 4:  I posted about it and Casey revealed himself.

1332
01:16:52,755 --> 01:16:53,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1333
01:16:53,385 --> 01:16:56,365
Speaker 4:  So ca you know, Casey and I are friends. Casey, you can tell by the tone

1334
01:16:56,365 --> 01:16:56,765
Speaker 4:  of my voice.

1335
01:16:58,465 --> 01:17:01,485
Speaker 4:  And so, you know, he just got a new house. He's like, everyone's excited.

1336
01:17:01,685 --> 01:17:05,205
Speaker 4:  Everyone's buying stuff. I just got a new house and he is like, should I

1337
01:17:05,205 --> 01:17:08,325
Speaker 4:  buy a Frame tv? And he sent me this text at 1230 in the morning. Oh my. And

1338
01:17:08,325 --> 01:17:12,165
Speaker 4:  I, he's on the West Coast. On the East coast. And I I I believe this conversation

1339
01:17:12,165 --> 01:17:14,445
Speaker 4:  took another full hour. Like, I was like, I can't let this go. Something's

1340
01:17:14,445 --> 01:17:15,485
Speaker 4:  wrong on the internet. Yeah,

1341
01:17:15,595 --> 01:17:18,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You, you like, you couldn't sleep that night until you get that done.

1342
01:17:18,245 --> 01:17:21,765
Speaker 4:  I tried so hard to, to make this man buy an LGGI was like, you play video

1343
01:17:21,775 --> 01:17:22,125
Speaker 4:  games.

1344
01:17:24,105 --> 01:17:26,885
Speaker 4:  You do you like quality. What,

1345
01:17:26,885 --> 01:17:28,165
Speaker 5:  What? Why did he want the frame?

1346
01:17:29,235 --> 01:17:33,165
Speaker 4:  Because in the end it was revealed that all of the

1347
01:17:33,165 --> 01:17:36,605
Speaker 4:  people, he was asking own frame TVs, including me.

1348
01:17:38,085 --> 01:17:41,965
Speaker 4:  I own two. I mean, one's just in the studio, in the podcast studio in my

1349
01:17:41,965 --> 01:17:44,245
Speaker 4:  house. It just shows the decoder logo. That's all it does. Yeah.

1350
01:17:44,585 --> 01:17:46,645
Speaker 5:  And it is, and it does have a beautiful bezel.

1351
01:17:47,225 --> 01:17:49,725
Speaker 4:  It was, yeah. It yeah, it, it, sure,

1352
01:17:50,035 --> 01:17:52,605
Speaker 5:  Sure. I'm trying to help you here Neil. I'm trying, I'm trying.

1353
01:17:52,945 --> 01:17:56,925
Speaker 4:  I'm saying the Frame TV is like a 10-year-old LCD panel with a single backlight

1354
01:17:57,025 --> 01:18:00,365
Speaker 4:  No dimming zones. It's just a bad tv. Yeah.

1355
01:18:01,025 --> 01:18:04,045
Speaker 4:  But people like it because this the display is Matt at

1356
01:18:05,625 --> 01:18:09,365
Speaker 4:  and most people don't actually watch their TVs anymore. They watch TikTok

1357
01:18:09,635 --> 01:18:12,765
Speaker 6:  Neli. Can I, can I float a theory at you that maybe

1358
01:18:13,305 --> 01:18:17,045
Speaker 6:  people don't care about 325% more dimming zones

1359
01:18:17,045 --> 01:18:19,445
Speaker 6:  anymore? Is it, is it possible they

1360
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:22,565
Speaker 4:  Don't care about TVs anymore? I think the Frame TV is the, the Harbinger

1361
01:18:22,805 --> 01:18:26,525
Speaker 4:  of Doom. What's the problem? What, what is the thing all streaming services

1362
01:18:26,625 --> 01:18:30,205
Speaker 4:  are facing? People are saying, okay, there's gonna be a big black rectangle

1363
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:33,725
Speaker 4:  in my house. I want it to look best when it's off. 'cause it's mostly off.

1364
01:18:34,235 --> 01:18:37,965
Speaker 5:  Wait, I just realized the Sony TV is basically like

1365
01:18:38,165 --> 01:18:41,885
Speaker 5:  a cool gaming PC to the, the

1366
01:18:41,905 --> 01:18:42,845
Speaker 5:  Frames iMac.

1367
01:18:44,355 --> 01:18:47,325
Speaker 4:  I've never, I don't think I've ever wanted to melt as much as I currently

1368
01:18:47,325 --> 01:18:48,005
Speaker 4:  wish to melt.

1369
01:18:48,465 --> 01:18:50,685
Speaker 5:  You have so many iMac in your house. Neli

1370
01:18:51,395 --> 01:18:54,605
Speaker 6:  Neli. This is why it just sounds is gonna be a huge hit on your place because

1371
01:18:54,605 --> 01:18:58,445
Speaker 6:  nobody watches their TV anyway. I was, it just sound while you look at TikTok,

1372
01:18:58,915 --> 01:18:59,205
Speaker 6:  it's

1373
01:18:59,205 --> 01:19:02,565
Speaker 4:  Gonna be incredible. I, but I'm saying like, I think I keep making this joke

1374
01:19:02,565 --> 01:19:06,325
Speaker 4:  that I could write 10,000 words about the Frame tv. It definitely could.

1375
01:19:06,415 --> 01:19:10,405
Speaker 4:  Maybe I just need to like rant into a camera for an hour. We can

1376
01:19:10,475 --> 01:19:13,845
Speaker 4:  edit it together. Yeah. But all I'm saying is you look at the market, you

1377
01:19:13,845 --> 01:19:17,685
Speaker 4:  look at the, the quality of TVs that are coming. Right? There's a technology

1378
01:19:17,815 --> 01:19:21,565
Speaker 4:  shift in the TV industry underway right now with these many identities. I

1379
01:19:21,565 --> 01:19:24,325
Speaker 4:  think they're gonna be really cool. And then you look at what people are

1380
01:19:24,485 --> 01:19:27,525
Speaker 4:  spending the money on, like what people think the best TV on the market is.

1381
01:19:27,985 --> 01:19:31,125
Speaker 4:  What's still priced? Ex you we're worried about these prices. Go look at

1382
01:19:31,125 --> 01:19:32,845
Speaker 4:  the frame when it's not on sale. Yeah.

1383
01:19:32,845 --> 01:19:33,125
Speaker 5:  It's

1384
01:19:33,125 --> 01:19:35,845
Speaker 4:  Insane. You're buying a 20 16,

1385
01:19:36,985 --> 01:19:40,925
Speaker 4:  20 17 vintage, you know, edge Lit l Ct p like it's

1386
01:19:41,005 --> 01:19:44,445
Speaker 4:  bad. And they're charging the prices of an OLED because the display is Matt

1387
01:19:44,445 --> 01:19:45,605
Speaker 4:  and you can pay 50 bucks for

1388
01:19:47,425 --> 01:19:49,125
Speaker 4:  the art store. And people are like, that's the best TV you can buy.

1389
01:19:49,665 --> 01:19:53,645
Speaker 5:  And that's why Samsung will stick with Android ties

1390
01:19:53,665 --> 01:19:57,645
Speaker 5:  on the phone. Oh, on the phone. It's all comes back to the phone in

1391
01:19:57,645 --> 01:19:58,085
Speaker 5:  Android.

1392
01:19:58,425 --> 01:19:58,925
Speaker 4:  Why is that?

1393
01:19:59,965 --> 01:20:00,205
Speaker 5:  I just

1394
01:20:00,205 --> 01:20:03,365
Speaker 4:  Forgot because the ties and App store is killing it on the

1395
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:04,725
Speaker 5:  Frame. It was a bad joke. Keep going.

1396
01:20:04,995 --> 01:20:08,845
Speaker 4:  Okay. We'll just cut that part anyway. I'm just saying it's like, just keep

1397
01:20:08,845 --> 01:20:11,125
Speaker 4:  ranting about this forever. Forever and ever and ever.

1398
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:12,045
Speaker 5:  I like

1399
01:20:12,045 --> 01:20:15,405
Speaker 4:  It though. I I'm telling you the Frame TV is the harbinger of doom

1400
01:20:16,185 --> 01:20:17,445
Speaker 4:  for the streaming services.

1401
01:20:19,825 --> 01:20:20,045
Speaker 5:  Mm.

1402
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:23,445
Speaker 4:  Because people are like, oh, we don't watch this thing. We're gonna pay a

1403
01:20:23,445 --> 01:20:23,845
Speaker 4:  premium.

1404
01:20:24,705 --> 01:20:28,085
Speaker 5:  Oh, you're saying because the TV is so crappy that when they do watch it,

1405
01:20:28,085 --> 01:20:29,325
Speaker 5:  they'll be like, what's the point?

1406
01:20:29,345 --> 01:20:33,325
Speaker 6:  People are buying a TV intentionally to not watch it is

1407
01:20:33,325 --> 01:20:36,205
Speaker 6:  what you're saying. Mm. The point of a TV is no longer to be watched.

1408
01:20:36,335 --> 01:20:40,245
Speaker 4:  Right. It's to just be there. It's like a binky. Yeah. Like if

1409
01:20:40,245 --> 01:20:42,925
Speaker 4:  I need a tv, I'll turn on this thing and I don't really care what it looks

1410
01:20:42,925 --> 01:20:45,565
Speaker 4:  like the rest of the time. It's gonna show me a picture. Is

1411
01:20:45,565 --> 01:20:46,525
Speaker 5:  It that many people though?

1412
01:20:47,145 --> 01:20:50,525
Speaker 4:  It is. I would argue the Frame TV is Samsung's most important product.

1413
01:20:50,945 --> 01:20:53,565
Speaker 4:  It is the product that has the most impact on the culture today.

1414
01:20:56,125 --> 01:20:57,645
Speaker 4:  A thousand words. 10,000 words.

1415
01:20:57,845 --> 01:21:00,205
Speaker 5:  I was like, I read 15,000 words. I wanna read all of these words. I need,

1416
01:21:00,205 --> 01:21:01,725
Speaker 4:  When am I gonna, I host two podcasts a week.

1417
01:21:03,285 --> 01:21:07,125
Speaker 4:  I and I, I can't even justify to the, to this group of people that we should

1418
01:21:07,125 --> 01:21:10,885
Speaker 4:  talk about the Frame TV that much. Everyone I need to take a week off.

1419
01:21:11,365 --> 01:21:15,245
Speaker 6:  I got a lot of emails asking for your 10,000 words on the

1420
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:17,845
Speaker 6:  Frame tv. So I think we're, we're gonna have to just do this at some point.

1421
01:21:17,915 --> 01:21:18,205
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

1422
01:21:18,205 --> 01:21:21,125
Speaker 5:  We're we're, we'll carve the time out. We'll call Carve the Time out. All

1423
01:21:21,205 --> 01:21:25,045
Speaker 4:  Right. Let's do one more TV related just to end this segment

1424
01:21:25,265 --> 01:21:28,005
Speaker 4:  in place. Okay. Of hope and optimism. Oh,

1425
01:21:28,015 --> 01:21:31,965
Speaker 6:  Noran. Are we about to go from Neli? Crazy to Crans is crazy. Yeah. Oh no.

1426
01:21:32,035 --> 01:21:35,445
Speaker 5:  Well 'cause one of the things I noticed in the Sony story was that these

1427
01:21:35,585 --> 01:21:39,245
Speaker 5:  TVs all have a TSC 2.0 twos in em. Yeah.

1428
01:21:39,985 --> 01:21:43,605
Speaker 5:  And this week was the big broadcasting

1429
01:21:43,815 --> 01:21:47,685
Speaker 5:  conference in Las Vegas, NAB. And everybody was making lots of

1430
01:21:47,845 --> 01:21:50,725
Speaker 5:  announcements. And the big announcement, some of the big announcements I

1431
01:21:50,725 --> 01:21:54,605

01:22:28,825 --> 01:22:30,485
Speaker 6:  I'm basically friends with Zoe de Chanel.

1445
01:22:30,765 --> 01:22:31,525
Speaker 5:  That's the new disclosure.

1446
01:22:34,345 --> 01:22:37,805
Speaker 5:  But, but they both announced that they were bringing new

1447
01:22:37,895 --> 01:22:41,205
Speaker 5:  technology to a TSC 3.0. Right now there's a couple of

1448
01:22:41,365 --> 01:22:45,285
Speaker 5:  channels in the country that broadcast on this spectrum that, that use

1449
01:22:45,445 --> 01:22:49,325
Speaker 5:  a TSC 3.0 Not a lot. And right now, If, you go and you watch shows on those

1450
01:22:49,405 --> 01:22:53,245
Speaker 5:  channels. It's just normal tv. There's no reason to

1451
01:22:53,405 --> 01:22:56,925
Speaker 5:  be excited. But coming soon because of

1452
01:22:57,115 --> 01:23:00,965
Speaker 5:  Roxy, you're gonna be able to pause and skip in your

1453
01:23:00,965 --> 01:23:04,245
Speaker 5:  local news. And then on the Today Show,

1454
01:23:04,695 --> 01:23:07,845
Speaker 5:  which I know everyone listening is a huge fan of,

1455
01:23:09,105 --> 01:23:12,205
Speaker 5:  you'll be able to do the same. That's pretty good. Through the NBC Universal

1456
01:23:12,205 --> 01:23:16,085
Speaker 5:  stuff. And so it's like, it's a little bit and little, little, yeah. Little

1457
01:23:16,105 --> 01:23:19,285
Speaker 5:  bit. Little little something happening there. And eventually it could be

1458
01:23:19,285 --> 01:23:22,965
Speaker 5:  something really cool. I still keep being like one of these days Peacock

1459
01:23:22,985 --> 01:23:26,925
Speaker 5:  is just gonna be on NBC and that'll just be the new NBC Oh,

1460
01:23:26,925 --> 01:23:27,045
Speaker 5:  I

1461
01:23:27,045 --> 01:23:30,205
Speaker 4:  See. And it'll distribute over there. I got, I got you. Yeah. One day, the

1462
01:23:30,205 --> 01:23:33,285
Speaker 4:  thing I want to real about this story is that when Alex was writing

1463
01:27:00,735 --> 01:27:04,075
Speaker 16:  And I'll tell my mom, mom, I'm gonna the bathroom, I'll be back if I'm not

1464
01:27:04,075 --> 01:27:07,875
Speaker 16:  out in like three minutes. Dog. She's like knocking on the door going,

1465
01:27:07,875 --> 01:27:11,275
Speaker 16:  everything okay in there? Yeah, mom. Everything's cool, dog.

1466
01:27:17,485 --> 01:27:21,465
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back. I would say that it's when there's not quite enough

1467
01:27:21,535 --> 01:27:25,465
Speaker 4:  news is when our show goes the longest. Mm. I don't know why

1468
01:27:25,465 --> 01:27:26,785
Speaker 4:  that is, but that has been true for 10

1469
01:27:26,785 --> 01:27:29,825
Speaker 6:  Years. I think it's when I give you too much time to mess with the rundown.

1470
01:27:29,825 --> 01:27:32,785
Speaker 6:  Before we start, I'm gonna start revealing The Vergecast to you.

1471
01:27:33,735 --> 01:27:37,465
Speaker 4:  Four minutes before we just just live reacts. We could just do a box of me

1472
01:27:37,905 --> 01:27:41,745
Speaker 4:  reacting to you doing To Vergecast the whole time. It's rare that we get

1473
01:27:41,785 --> 01:27:44,625
Speaker 4:  a show that's so out of control that we bring up Big, Papa Joe.

1474
01:27:46,215 --> 01:27:46,505
Speaker 6:  Here

1475
01:27:46,505 --> 01:27:49,465
Speaker 4:  We are. That's a lot. All right, we're here. We gotta we gotta wrap this

1476
01:27:49,465 --> 01:27:53,425
Speaker 4:  thing up. We're we're just way, way over the line. I've promised it and now

1477
01:27:53,425 --> 01:27:57,265
Speaker 4:  it's here. David Pierce's headline blitz. David,

1478
01:27:57,335 --> 01:27:57,945
Speaker 4:  take it away.

1479
01:27:58,345 --> 01:28:01,505
Speaker 6:  I would like to just briefly catch you up on all of the things that are happening

1480
01:28:01,505 --> 01:28:04,945
Speaker 6:  with TikTok, because TikTok is not banned. It is still here

1481
01:28:06,125 --> 01:28:09,465
Speaker 6:  and it is wild, is just how I would say it. So here's what has gone on in

1482
01:28:09,465 --> 01:28:13,425
Speaker 6:  TikTok land just since the last time we did this show together in

1483
01:28:13,425 --> 01:28:17,385
Speaker 6:  the studio. TikTok Notes is an app that is coming out. It's only available

1484
01:28:17,405 --> 01:28:20,225
Speaker 6:  in a couple of countries, but it's just straight up Instagram. TikTok just

1485
01:28:20,225 --> 01:28:23,465
Speaker 6:  did Instagram and they're like, here, would you like Instagram? TikTok made

1486
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:27,385
Speaker 6:  it. So that's the thing that exists. There are also now ways to

1487
01:28:27,405 --> 01:28:30,705
Speaker 6:  buy event tickets, like concert tickets and stuff inside of TikTok because

1488
01:28:30,765 --> 01:28:33,545
Speaker 6:  TikTok hasn't found enough ways to sell you stuff. They wanna sell you more

1489
01:28:33,545 --> 01:28:36,865
Speaker 6:  stuff. I think that is gonna work. I think like

1490
01:28:37,805 --> 01:28:40,945
Speaker 6:  all of this concert stuff is going to move inside of music apps in really

1491
01:28:41,105 --> 01:28:43,425
Speaker 6:  interesting ways. And I think TikTok is gonna do it first, and it's gonna

1492
01:28:43,425 --> 01:28:47,345
Speaker 6:  be really fascinating. There's been a bunch of like non-New

1493
01:28:47,575 --> 01:28:51,465
Speaker 6:  news about the TikTok divestment stuff. There's a new bill in the

1494
01:28:51,585 --> 01:28:55,545
Speaker 6:  house that is being attached to aid to foreign countries

1495
01:28:55,545 --> 01:28:59,505
Speaker 6:  that is partly now also a TikTok ban. So it's possible

1496
01:28:59,505 --> 01:29:02,010
Speaker 6:  that that is going to move to the Senate much more quickly where they're

1497
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:05,595
Speaker 6:  gonna have to talk about divestment and banning. The president has said that

1498
01:29:05,595 --> 01:29:09,515
Speaker 6:  he's going to potentially delay a ban another six months to make

1499
01:29:09,515 --> 01:29:13,155
Speaker 6:  this all happen again. TikTok has said it's going to

1500
01:29:13,595 --> 01:29:17,475
Speaker 6:  restrict people who p keep posting problematic stuff on the

1501
01:29:17,495 --> 01:29:18,155
Speaker 6:  For You feed.

1502
01:29:20,135 --> 01:29:23,955
Speaker 6:  It also was reported this week that all of this project Texas stuff,

1503
01:29:23,955 --> 01:29:26,755
Speaker 6:  which I would say we have relentlessly made fun of on this show for a long

1504
01:29:26,755 --> 01:29:30,435
Speaker 6:  time, is basically just a bunch of nonsense. And that by dance has

1505
01:29:30,815 --> 01:29:33,555
Speaker 6:  access to lots of US users, TikTok, data,

1506
01:29:34,835 --> 01:29:38,195
Speaker 6:  Twitch and Spotify continue to do their best TikTok impressions.

1507
01:29:38,625 --> 01:29:42,035
Speaker 6:  Spotify is rolling out a remix thing so you can start to play with music

1508
01:29:42,035 --> 01:29:44,515
Speaker 6:  in the same way that you can play with sounds and speed them up on TikTok.

1509
01:29:45,475 --> 01:29:48,395
Speaker 6:  Twitch is doing a For You feed basically, I don't know how to say it more

1510
01:29:48,395 --> 01:29:51,835
Speaker 6:  than that. They just did a For You feed for Twitch, which I think is actually

1511
01:29:51,835 --> 01:29:55,755
Speaker 6:  very smart. The world is TikTok now. Like everybody is trying

1512
01:29:55,755 --> 01:29:58,875
Speaker 6:  to become TikTok and TikTok is trying to become everybody else. And maybe

1513
01:29:58,875 --> 01:30:01,355
Speaker 6:  it'll be banned and maybe it won't. And that's all I got.

1514
01:30:01,995 --> 01:30:05,915
Speaker 4:  I will say that TikTok trying to sell stuff relentlessly is just

1515
01:30:06,475 --> 01:30:08,835
Speaker 4:  reaching new levels of weirdness. For me personally,

1516
01:30:08,995 --> 01:30:12,435
Speaker 5:  I found a solution. Okay. Okay. Here's what you guys are gonna do. You're

1517
01:30:12,435 --> 01:30:15,715
Speaker 5:  gonna go on TikTok and you're gonna search Deep Talk

1518
01:30:16,415 --> 01:30:20,195
Speaker 5:  one word Deep Talk, and then you're gonna watch a bunch of those videos.

1519
01:30:20,385 --> 01:30:23,475
Speaker 5:  They're gonna be really weird. They're gonna be nonsensical. You're gonna

1520
01:30:23,475 --> 01:30:26,635
Speaker 5:  be really confused. You're gonna be like, this is just, looks like what Kranz

1521
01:30:26,635 --> 01:30:30,155
Speaker 5:  brain looks like on the inside. Yeah. Yeah. And you like a few of those and

1522
01:30:30,155 --> 01:30:33,795
Speaker 5:  then you're on Deep Talk and you're no longer on Shop Talk. Okay.

1523
01:30:34,065 --> 01:30:34,515
Speaker 5:  It's great.

1524
01:30:34,835 --> 01:30:38,755
Speaker 4:  I would, when I say all AI right now is, is my experience

1525
01:30:38,755 --> 01:30:42,515
Speaker 4:  with it is like weird and bad. Yeah. TikTok believes I

1526
01:30:42,515 --> 01:30:46,435
Speaker 4:  want to coil things that look like ropes. Mm. So much. It's

1527
01:30:46,435 --> 01:30:49,755
Speaker 4:  like you're gonna buy a garden hose reel, you're gonna buy an extension cord

1528
01:30:49,875 --> 01:30:53,475
Speaker 4:  reel. You're gonna buy a USB cord re which I don't think you should be doing

1529
01:30:53,495 --> 01:30:57,315
Speaker 4:  at all. It's just like, have you thought about reels? Buy

1530
01:30:57,475 --> 01:31:01,035
Speaker 4:  'em, just buy 'em now. and it and the the

1531
01:31:01,035 --> 01:31:04,995
Speaker 4:  pitches are increasingly abstract and a little threatening. Yeah.

1532
01:31:05,465 --> 01:31:09,235
Speaker 4:  Like, they're like, you will feel guilt. They, you don't get in on this hose

1533
01:31:09,395 --> 01:31:10,155
Speaker 4:  reel deal now.

1534
01:31:10,945 --> 01:31:11,955
Speaker 5:  Mine is a puppet.

1535
01:31:13,665 --> 01:31:15,315
Speaker 4:  It's already bad. It's already bad. Alex

1536
01:31:15,585 --> 01:31:19,395
Speaker 5:  Skateboarding on a leaf over water. Yeah.

1537
01:31:19,395 --> 01:31:22,195
Speaker 5:  That's all my TikTok is right now. And it's great. I'm like, I don't know

1538
01:31:22,195 --> 01:31:23,035
Speaker 5:  what the hell's happening here.

1539
01:31:23,135 --> 01:31:24,995
Speaker 4:  I'm just saying there's, there are people out there right now who have bought

1540
01:31:24,995 --> 01:31:28,595
Speaker 4:  like up upwards of a dozen hose reels because this algorithm

1541
01:31:28,775 --> 01:31:31,995
Speaker 4:  is just the ruthlessly manipulated them. Yeah.

1542
01:31:32,275 --> 01:31:36,075
Speaker 5:  I mean, I did buy something not directly from TikTok. All right. But they

1543
01:31:36,075 --> 01:31:38,435
Speaker 5:  should be a strainer. I went and got it on Amazon. It's great.

1544
01:31:38,685 --> 01:31:41,955
Speaker 4:  We'll see. Do we have a sense of the Senate bill might be moving?

1545
01:31:42,575 --> 01:31:43,915
Speaker 4:  Do we have a sense of it's gonna happen or not

1546
01:31:44,095 --> 01:31:48,075
Speaker 6:  At the moment? Not exactly, but Lauren Finer just wrote a really

1547
01:31:48,075 --> 01:31:51,915
Speaker 6:  good story that the, the general assumption is that because it's tied to

1548
01:31:51,915 --> 01:31:55,895
Speaker 6:  foreign aid, the Senate is basically gonna have no choice but to talk

1549
01:31:55,895 --> 01:31:59,245
Speaker 6:  about it. Like where we landed with the last bill is the Senate is just sort

1550
01:31:59,245 --> 01:32:00,925
Speaker 6:  of studiously pretending it doesn't exist.

1551
01:32:02,675 --> 01:32:06,605
Speaker 6:  That is going to be less possible now. And it's, it's, I

1552
01:32:06,605 --> 01:32:10,565
Speaker 6:  think it's gonna get raised one way or another. Where it goes seems to

1553
01:32:10,565 --> 01:32:11,205
Speaker 6:  be anyone's guess.

1554
01:32:11,625 --> 01:32:15,245
Speaker 4:  All right. We, we have time for I, I think two more. You, that was David's

1555
01:32:15,365 --> 01:32:18,485
Speaker 4:  headline Blitz. Everyone congratulate David, please sign a note you'd like

1556
01:32:18,485 --> 01:32:19,845
Speaker 4:  more headline Blitz in The future. You could

1557
01:32:19,845 --> 01:32:22,325
Speaker 6:  Sponsor the headline blitz inside of the lightning round if you'd

1558
01:32:22,325 --> 01:32:25,045
Speaker 4:  Like to. It's available for sponsorships at this time.

1559
01:32:26,335 --> 01:32:29,245
Speaker 4:  We're still, we're we're very close. Just everyone close your eyes and send

1560
01:32:29,245 --> 01:32:32,085
Speaker 4:  good vibes for our first Lightning round sponsor, and then we'll move on

1561
01:32:32,085 --> 01:32:34,085
Speaker 4:  to the headline blitz. All right. Alex, what you got? Yeah,

1562
01:32:34,085 --> 01:32:37,725
Speaker 5:  So Boston Dynamics, they make the, the robots. That's a good one. Yeah. They,

1563
01:32:37,725 --> 01:32:41,245
Speaker 5:  they, they make the robots. Earlier this week they said goodbye to Atlas

1564
01:32:41,425 --> 01:32:45,285
Speaker 5:  and then the very next day they said hello to New Atlas in the most

1565
01:32:45,455 --> 01:32:48,565
Speaker 5:  terrifying video of all time. Yeah. Where like the legs

1566
01:32:49,505 --> 01:32:53,085
Speaker 5:  did like some weird 360 degree hinge stuff.

1567
01:32:53,665 --> 01:32:57,005
Speaker 5:  The head looks like some sort of lamp. It basically looks like a video game

1568
01:32:57,005 --> 01:33:00,965
Speaker 5:  monster. And, and then we wrote about how it needs

1569
01:33:00,965 --> 01:33:01,525
Speaker 5:  to have hair.

1570
01:33:02,345 --> 01:33:05,485
Speaker 4:  We did, we did do that. It was a good pitch from Alex. Yeah. And I said,

1571
01:33:05,485 --> 01:33:08,645
Speaker 4:  just make sure it's over reported. And boy did Eve pizer over report the

1572
01:33:08,645 --> 01:33:09,805
Speaker 4:  story of why robots need hair.

1573
01:33:10,485 --> 01:33:14,285
Speaker 5:  Excellent. Just asking directly Some poor scientists. Do you think the

1574
01:33:14,285 --> 01:33:17,725
Speaker 5:  robot would be less creepy with fur and the robot's like No.

1575
01:33:17,905 --> 01:33:21,805
Speaker 4:  The scientist was like, not the robot. You don't ask the robot. What would

1576
01:33:21,805 --> 01:33:23,165
Speaker 4:  make it less creepy? Sorry.

1577
01:33:26,975 --> 01:33:27,605
Speaker 5:  Don't worry about it.

1578
01:33:29,345 --> 01:33:33,245
Speaker 4:  Was this written by a robot? Yeah. Give the robot's hair written by

1579
01:33:33,365 --> 01:33:33,925
Speaker 4:  a robot.

1580
01:33:36,455 --> 01:33:40,205
Speaker 4:  Sorry. You should watch the video. Our former VI reporter

1581
01:33:40,255 --> 01:33:44,165
Speaker 4:  James Vincent, I believe his post on the video was, it's

1582
01:33:44,165 --> 01:33:47,285
Speaker 4:  funny that Boston Dynamics just leaned directly into Terrifying. Yeah.

1583
01:33:47,355 --> 01:33:50,365
Speaker 5:  Just Oh yeah. Horrifying, horrifying thing. It's

1584
01:33:50,405 --> 01:33:53,085
Speaker 4:  Very good because it looks like a person, but it moves like a horror movie.
