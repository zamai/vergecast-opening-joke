Speaker 3:  Welcome to the Vergecast. The flagship podcast of loud engine sounds.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,400
Speaker 3:  I'm your friend, David Pierce. And I am currently sitting in my basement

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,120
Speaker 3:  playing Mario tennis on my Nintendo switch on my television,

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:19,000
Speaker 3:  which doesn't sound like a big deal, but is actually a very big deal to me.

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,880
Speaker 3:  You might have heard me complaining on the show a couple of weeks ago about

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,840
Speaker 3:  all of Nintendo's stupid proprietary docs and cables for the

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,280
Speaker 3:  switch. And a bunch of you reached out to recommend that I buy one product,

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,640
Speaker 3:  the Yankee janky, I don't know. It's GE N K I, and

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,120
Speaker 3:  the product is called the convert doc. I bought one. It works perfectly,

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,080
Speaker 3:  and I'm very grateful to everyone who recommended it. Anyway, we have a great

43
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,350
Speaker 3:  Welcome back last week, as you probably already know if you've listened to

44
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,190
Speaker 3:  this show, Samsung held yet another unpacked event and launched

45
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,230
Speaker 3:  a bunch of new stuff.

46
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,470
Speaker 5:  We wanted you to be able to imagine something different, an entirely

47
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,190
Speaker 5:  new way to think about your smartphone.

48
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,310
Speaker 3:  There's the galaxy Z fold four, which folds together like a

49
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,200
Speaker 3:  hotdog bun. And then there's the Z flip for which flips closed like

50
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,960
Speaker 3:  a hamburger bun, plus some headphones and watches and all sorts of other

51
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,600
Speaker 3:  stuff. It's a lot to sort through. So we asked you to send in

52
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,240
Speaker 3:  whatever questions you had about the phones in particular to our Vergecast

53
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,000
Speaker 3:  hotline, which the number don't forget is eight, six, six verge. One one,

54
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,920
Speaker 3:  call us, ask us all your questions in this case. We got some great ones.

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,160
Speaker 3:  Thanks again to everyone who called in. It's super fun hearing from you.

56
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,280
Speaker 3:  Please keep calling to answer all of your questions about Samsung, which

57
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,280
Speaker 3:  were weird and all over the place. I brought in a panel of verge experts,

58
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,960
Speaker 3:  deputy editor, Dan Seifert.

59
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:31,440
Speaker 6:  Hello,

60
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,600
Speaker 3:  Reviewer Allison Johnson. Hello and managing editor, Alex. Crans

61
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,360
Speaker 3:  hello. I think we're gonna get through a bunch of questions, cuz a lot of

62
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,040
Speaker 3:  people have a lot of thoughts about Samsung. Let's start. I think our first

63
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,040
Speaker 3:  question is from Leo.

64
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,120
Speaker 7:  Hi David and merge crew. This is Leo calling from beautiful west Michigan.

65
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,040
Speaker 7:  I'm one of those mini iPhone mini or other

66
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,880
Speaker 7:  compact phone fans. There are dozens of us out there who like small phones

67
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,680
Speaker 7:  currently rocking a way too big pale six. And I'm wondering

68
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,320
Speaker 7:  is the Z flip four. Finally, what I'm looking for in a small Android phone,

69
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,280
Speaker 7:  I really miss my Sony experience Z three compact. And I don't know if I wanna

70
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,760
Speaker 7:  switch to the iPhone. So I'd love to hear your thoughts about size and if

71
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,600
Speaker 7:  not, Z four flip what are my options out there for small phones? And

72
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,200
Speaker 7:  do you hear any rumblings and anything coming down the bike? Thanks.

73
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,600
Speaker 3:  Okay. First of all, I really miss my Sony experience. Z three

74
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,560
Speaker 3:  compact is a sentence you will only hear on the verge cast. Yes. So congratulations,

75
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,160
Speaker 3:  correct to all of us, but also I really like this idea because it had never

76
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,960
Speaker 3:  really clicked for me that like maybe this new run of flip phones is like

77
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,120
Speaker 3:  the small smartphones we were promised. I think this is very interesting

78
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,360
Speaker 3:  theory, Dan, you're making a face. Why are you making a face?

79
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,320
Speaker 6:  I hate to pour cold water on that. But it's

80
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,080
Speaker 6:  what I do. As someone who's used a folding

81
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,320
Speaker 6:  flip phone, I'm here to tell you that they are small when they're closed

82
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,960
Speaker 6:  and fit in your pocket. Very nice. So if that's what you want from a small

83
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,920
Speaker 6:  phone is like to fit in more places easier, whether it's your pocket

84
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,000
Speaker 6:  or purse or a bag or whatever. Yes, they do that. But when I

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,960
Speaker 6:  think of a small phone, I think of, I can use this easily in one hand. And

86
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,560
Speaker 6:  that is where they do not work well because it takes two hands to open up

87
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,320
Speaker 6:  the flip every single time, unless you wanna like jam your thumb under there

88
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,880
Speaker 6:  and gouge the screen as you do it, don't recommend doing that with your thousand

89
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,720
Speaker 6:  dollars phone. And then when you open it, it's a 6.8 inch screen.

90
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,000
Speaker 6:  It's a big phone. So it's not like it's like easily reachable with one hand,

91
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,000
Speaker 6:  like to scroll down from the top or reach across with your thumb or anything

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,360
Speaker 6:  like that. It becomes a big phone. So in my mind,

93
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,000
Speaker 6:  no, these do not solve the small phone desire because they are not easily

94
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,880
Speaker 6:  used by one hand. But I think Allison probably

95
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,960
Speaker 6:  has a suggestion for you.

96
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,480
Speaker 8:  I sure do. Let's

97
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:44,720
Speaker 3:  Hear it.

98
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,120
Speaker 8:  No, this is the little kind of, I guess dark horse of

99
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,000
Speaker 8:  2022, the ASU Xeno nine.

100
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,520
Speaker 8:  I have used it. I haven't fully reviewed it yet because a couple of

101
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,320
Speaker 8:  things have come up, but it's a little one. It's a compact is like

102
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,960
Speaker 8:  a truly compact Android flagship.

103
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,280
Speaker 8:  It's got top of the line processor, really interesting camera

104
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,480
Speaker 8:  system where the stabilization like moves the whole camera

105
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,120
Speaker 8:  around. There's just a lot of cool stuff about it. It's like IP

106
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,920
Speaker 8:  68. There's a headphone Jack. I hold it in my hand and I'm just like,

107
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,320
Speaker 8:  this just feels right.

108
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,680
Speaker 3:  We establish on this show very recently, Allison, that 6.1 inches

109
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,400
Speaker 3:  is the correct size for a smaller smartphone.

110
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,240
Speaker 3:  Does the Zen phone pass the test?

111
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,280
Speaker 8:  So here's the asterisks on that 6.1 inches

112
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:40,480
Speaker 8:  is my, like I concede that not everybody wants a small phone.

113
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,240
Speaker 8:  Like I want a small phone. Everybody else seems to want a giant phone. So

114
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,040
Speaker 8:  I think like 6.1 inches is where we can all kind of like agree and

115
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,680
Speaker 8:  that's okay. I review a lot of Android phones. So

116
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,680
Speaker 8:  as my team has pointed out my perception on what a

117
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,360
Speaker 8:  small phone is, has been skewed. I took the

118
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,200
Speaker 8:  pixel six, a out of the box. I was like, look a tiny phone. And

119
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,520
Speaker 8:  everybody quickly corrected me that it was not tiny.

120
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,200
Speaker 8:  So yeah, I don't, I think I'm an unreliable narrator here. I like a small

121
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,480
Speaker 8:  phone. I'm desensitized to giant phones.

122
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,920
Speaker 3:  So it seems to me like the, the true answer for Leo here is like, if, if

123
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,040
Speaker 3:  what you want in a small phone is that it is like smaller and will fit in

124
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,840
Speaker 3:  your pockets more easily. Congratulations. The flip phone is great. If what

125
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,520
Speaker 3:  you want is like an actually small phone that you can hold in your hand either

126
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,480
Speaker 3:  by the Zen phone or just get over it and come live in the large phone world

127
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,480
Speaker 3:  in which we unfortunately all exist. Yeah. Which I feel like is the right

128
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,040
Speaker 3:  answer. Like if you want a small phone, just stop wanting a small phone,

129
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,240
Speaker 3:  feels like the correct way to live your life going forward.

130
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,080
Speaker 8:  I don't know if that's how I would put it. Yeah.

131
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,840
Speaker 8:  Look at the Zen phone nine. It's lovely.

132
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,080
Speaker 3:  I like it. Okay. So next up we have another call about

133
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,560
Speaker 3:  screen size actually from, I believe a caller from Aurora, Illinois.

134
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,160
Speaker 9:  Hey, I have a question about folding phones and video aspect ratios.

135
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,920
Speaker 9:  If you're watching YouTube and standard, like 16 by nine,

136
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,800
Speaker 9:  how much bigger is that video actually getting, when you go from the

137
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,600
Speaker 9:  outside screen on like a Samsung folding phone to the inside

138
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,440
Speaker 9:  screen, it seems like a lot of that would just be extra letter boxing

139
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,720
Speaker 9:  and then just like marginally bigger video itself. All right.

140
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,840
Speaker 9:  Thanks. Have a great day.

141
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,080
Speaker 3:  I believe I am the person on this podcast currently, who has used folding

142
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,720
Speaker 3:  phones, the least. So you all tell me, I think this is a

143
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,080
Speaker 3:  perfectly fair question though. Like what if you're just looking at a 16,

144
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,000
Speaker 3:  nine video on this, you know, giant ass internal display of the fold.

145
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,280
Speaker 3:  What are you really getting?

146
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,880
Speaker 6:  You do get a bigger video picture and yes,

147
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,800
Speaker 6:  you do get black bars above and be, and below it, especially if you turn

148
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,760
Speaker 6:  the phone into landscape mode and you're full screen that YouTube video,

149
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,000
Speaker 6:  the open fold phone is roughly four by three aspect

150
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,800
Speaker 6:  ratio. You know, there's, it's, it's not exact, but it's close enough. So,

151
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,000
Speaker 6:  so you will get black bars above and below it. However, within those black

152
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,720
Speaker 6:  bars, you still get a large video. Like I can put a

153
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,600
Speaker 6:  pixel six pro above the video and it's like the same size.

154
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,920
Speaker 6:  So you, when you full screen it, you are getting like a big, big phone

155
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:14,360
Speaker 6:  size video when you're playing it. What's interesting about it though,

156
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,320
Speaker 6:  is if you don't full screen it, then you get like all this extra UI

157
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,240
Speaker 6:  that you don't get on normal phones, cuz it behaves like a tablet UI. So

158
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,760
Speaker 6:  you get the right rail of suggested videos. You get your

159
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,000
Speaker 6:  descriptions, your comments and things like that. So like it, it depends

160
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,600
Speaker 6:  on like where you want to use this extra space that you have, but you can

161
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:36,560
Speaker 6:  make more use of it than if you just had a standard, a slab

162
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,520
Speaker 6:  smartphone with a giant screen on it.

163
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:42,880
Speaker 10:  Also 16 by nine is like a very popular aspect ratio.

164
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,520
Speaker 10:  It's hugely popular on YouTube, et cetera. But it's not the only one

165
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:51,000
Speaker 10:  all of TV up until what like the mid two thousands was in four by three.

166
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,480
Speaker 10:  Some movies were in four by three, like you've got even narrower

167
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,480
Speaker 10:  aspect ratios, like 1.8, five and

168
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,520
Speaker 10:  2.39 and, and all of these super cinematic ones. So like there's a lot

169
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,640
Speaker 10:  of different types of screens. And I think we saw like Microsoft even saying

170
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,560
Speaker 10:  four by three is actually a really good display size because it's gonna

171
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,320
Speaker 10:  give you all of those different ones feeling kind of nice.

172
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,200
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I think the best way to think about it is like if you've ever watched

173
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,640
Speaker 6:  video on an iPad, it's gonna be a very similar experience to that. You're

174
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,000
Speaker 6:  going to have black bars above and be below it. Those will change in size

175
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,960
Speaker 6:  depending on what aspect ratio it is. But this is very much like having an

176
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,440
Speaker 6:  iPad mini that folds in half. And so all of the, you know,

177
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,000
Speaker 6:  compromises that you get with that, but all the benefits that you get to.

178
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,280
Speaker 3:  Okay. Allison, what have you found in, in testing the Z fold for so far?

179
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,080
Speaker 3:  Are you like a full screener or do you do the like big phone size video

180
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,560
Speaker 3:  plus all the interface around it?

181
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,680
Speaker 8:  It's kind of dependent on like how I wanna be sitting. Like

182
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,920
Speaker 8:  sometimes you wanna lay down and, and not hold your phone.

183
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,600
Speaker 8:  So I think that's the, like I've used this phone

184
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,840
Speaker 8:  more for us. Like it is a truly small screen experience

185
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,960
Speaker 8:  having it on like the cover screen, but you can prop that up

186
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,840
Speaker 8:  and play video. You can have it open in the L shape

187
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,960
Speaker 8:  and watch a teeny tiny video that way, which kind of

188
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,440
Speaker 8:  stinks. But you don't have to use your hands

189
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:17,400
Speaker 3:  Somewhere. Someone on Samsung's marketing team is so happy. The amount

190
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,320
Speaker 3:  of time they have spent being like, look, you can put this thing on a table,

191
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,480
Speaker 3:  folded into the L shape and watch videos. And I guess it's good. Like who

192
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,480
Speaker 3:  knew it was worth it?

193
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,720
Speaker 8:  I like propped it up like a book, I guess, where it's like

194
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,760
Speaker 8:  open. And I had a, I had TikTok playing on one side, which

195
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,680
Speaker 8:  that even kind of works so many different things you can do with it.

196
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,800
Speaker 3:  So you open it up, you go split screen TikTok on one side reels on the

197
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,600
Speaker 3:  other side and just infinite doom scrolling forever

198
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,240
Speaker 8:  Fight. The two of you fight it out.

199
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:50,640
Speaker 3:  That was helpful. Thank you all. Let's move on to the next one. A lot of

200
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,520
Speaker 3:  people have questions about screen size, which I guess is fair. This is what

201
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,920
Speaker 3:  folding phones are all about. Our next question comes from Kevin,

202
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:00,720
Speaker 11:  Big H cast. What is a computer? My name is Kevin. And my question is with

203
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,120
Speaker 11:  the Z three, there are already issues with things like the Google feed

204
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:08,000
Speaker 11:  and YouTube, the YouTube ops, basically having side column,

205
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,360
Speaker 11:  unless you were turned into what I guess essentially a landscape mode. So

206
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,840
Speaker 11:  now that they've made the screen shorter on the D 44, doesn't that mean

207
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,960
Speaker 11:  that that landscape real estate has been made smaller? Like, are those apps

208
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,560
Speaker 11:  gonna populate properly? They already had issues. Yeah. Let me know. Thanks

209
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,920
Speaker 3:  Allison. I really wanna know what you've seen so far, cuz I think this is

210
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,760
Speaker 3:  a thing Samsung has been tinkering with over the last few years

211
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,800
Speaker 3:  with like how apps should render at different screen sizes. And when you

212
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,920
Speaker 3:  open the phone versus when you turn the phone versus when it's closed, like

213
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,760
Speaker 3:  has Samsung figured out how apps are supposed to look on all these screens

214
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:40,960
Speaker 3:  yet?

215
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,120
Speaker 8:  I mean, I think they've gotten pretty close to me. Like the

216
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,440
Speaker 8:  difference is, you know, with the phone closed using the cover screen,

217
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,480
Speaker 8:  does it feel like a normal phone? Does it feel just super

218
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:57,000
Speaker 8:  thin and weird and claustrophobic? It's all right.

219
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:01,000
Speaker 8:  Like it's good enough. I don't think the screen size difference

220
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,560
Speaker 8:  is big enough to make any kind of big difference in, in how much

221
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:09,760
Speaker 8:  video, you know, and how things render or like how

222
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,240
Speaker 8:  much content you can get on the screen. It's just a matter of like, is it

223
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,320
Speaker 8:  a little more comfortable to use? And for me it's been the first

224
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,840
Speaker 8:  day of using it. I was like, I feel like I'm aiming at these really tiny,

225
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,120
Speaker 8:  you know, keys on the keyboard, but I got used to it after about a day. And

226
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,000
Speaker 8:  I think it's, it's like 90% there to where it's a big enough screen that

227
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,160
Speaker 8:  you feel comfortable being like, yes, this is my phone.

228
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:36,200
Speaker 3:  Does it feel less like a TV remote now? Cuz that was always my issue with

229
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,280
Speaker 3:  the early folds. Was that when you, when they were closed, it felt like you

230
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,360
Speaker 3:  were holding this like impossibly long TV remote.

231
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,640
Speaker 8:  It's still a little remote ish. Okay. Almost there. But you, you still

232
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,280
Speaker 8:  get that vibe

233
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,240
Speaker 3:  And Dan Android is supposed to solve this at some point, right? Like isn't

234
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,360
Speaker 3:  Android 12 L going to be the magic thing that fixes everything for us.

235
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,440
Speaker 6:  The fold for does run 12 L or it's based on Android, 12 L with

236
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,320
Speaker 6:  Samsung optimizations on top of it. So it does have that. What 12

237
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,240
Speaker 6:  L really does though is really kind of hard to say. We've only seen

238
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,200
Speaker 6:  12 L on a big tablet and then this fold four.

239
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,400
Speaker 6:  So we haven't seen it on a lot of places yet. Mostly what you see it on in

240
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,080
Speaker 6:  the fold. Four is the little task bar at the bottom. Where on the fold

241
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:20,800
Speaker 6:  three or the earlier models you had like a task bar. You could like

242
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:24,840
Speaker 6:  swipe in from the side of the phone to launch apps from now, it's gonna be

243
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,440
Speaker 6:  at the bottom, similar to how Mac S and windows work and things like that.

244
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,320
Speaker 6:  And I think that like, there are a couple of things that Samsung does to

245
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,200
Speaker 6:  how you decide how you want the screen to render apps.

246
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,920
Speaker 6:  Like you can go into settings and adjust the screen zoom. So you can say,

247
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,320
Speaker 6:  give me less zoom. So I fit more stuff on the screen or gimme

248
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,600
Speaker 6:  bigger zoom. So I got bigger icons and it's easier to read and stuff like

249
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,000
Speaker 6:  that. And that will impact how certain apps render, because that will adjust

250
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,600
Speaker 6:  whether an app says, oh, I'm displayed on a tablet and I'm gonna show my

251
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,280
Speaker 6:  tablet interface or, oh, I'm displayed on a phone and I'm just gonna be a

252
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,680
Speaker 6:  big phone interface. So that can like tweak things a little bit. I think

253
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,960
Speaker 6:  that the difference between the fold three and the fold four is really not

254
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,880
Speaker 6:  that significant. Even though like on a spec sheet, the aspect ratio is

255
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,160
Speaker 6:  slightly different and the screen size measures slightly different. The difference

256
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,840
Speaker 6:  in practice is not that huge. So like an app is likely going to

257
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,680
Speaker 6:  display exactly the same on the fold four, as it did on the fold

258
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,720
Speaker 6:  three. And we kind of like did a little bit of comparisons. We know that

259
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,160
Speaker 6:  YouTube definitely does. Like it's exact same way on the fold three in the

260
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,640
Speaker 6:  fold four. So there's like, you know, some tweaks you can make to it and

261
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,120
Speaker 6:  things like that. And it's really gonna very depend on what apps that you

262
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,040
Speaker 6:  are really into famously. The one app that really does

263
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,960
Speaker 6:  not like foldable phones is shocker, Instagram. And the way

264
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,920
Speaker 6:  that it opens on the inside screens is it opens in a,

265
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:48,400
Speaker 6:  essentially a letter box format. So Samsung has like built

266
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,840
Speaker 6:  software to, to handle Instagram. So you can see Instagram without

267
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,680
Speaker 6:  it like zooming in and cropping out everything really horribly. But

268
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,080
Speaker 6:  like that was Samsung fixing it because Android does not really fix it.

269
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,680
Speaker 3:  So before we move on, the thing I have to know is how zoomed in is your phone,

270
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,840
Speaker 3:  Dan, for anyone who is not familiar with Dan seafer uses bigger

271
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,160
Speaker 3:  font on his computer than almost anyone else. I know. So I just feel like,

272
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,000
Speaker 3:  I just need to know like, are we, are we a right in the middle guy? Are we

273
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,720
Speaker 3:  a zoom all the way in guy? Like where are we at?

274
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,640
Speaker 6:  I was tinkering with it today, actually. Cuz of course I also

275
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,600
Speaker 6:  tinker, I've got the zoom set all the way to the plus and then

276
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,120
Speaker 6:  I make the font smaller. I tried it the other way so that I could have like

277
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,040
Speaker 6:  more space, but just make the font bigger. And that made like the interface

278
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,840
Speaker 6:  elements all weird.

279
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,080
Speaker 3:  So like big UI, small text.

280
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,800
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I think it's actually the default UI size cuz there's two, at least

281
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,280
Speaker 6:  on the fold three, there are two settings there's default and then more space.

282
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,320
Speaker 6:  And so I've got it set on default and then I just take the font back one

283
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,200
Speaker 6:  notch so that I can fit more stuff in the screen. All right. And then just

284
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,400
Speaker 6:  hold it closer to my face, I guess

285
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,640
Speaker 3:  Just ramp up the prescription on your glasses just real quick.

286
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,520
Speaker 3:  Alright, let's move on. So next up we have a question from Justin.

287
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,480
Speaker 12:  Hey David, it's Justin, Jay Mitch, and your Twitter DMS. I

288
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,360
Speaker 12:  wanted to know if the new Z flip four has USBC

289
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:11,400
Speaker 12:  display port out or USB HD I over USBC

290
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,680
Speaker 12:  so that I could do decks or just mirror my Android phone to my

291
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:19,200
Speaker 12:  AR headset so that I can watch movies in bed without bothering my wife.

292
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:23,160
Speaker 12:  That is my dream set up a small foldable device that I can put

293
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,920
Speaker 12:  in my pocket and then plug into a huge display and none of the other

294
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,520
Speaker 12:  flips had it. And I was waiting to see if they would announce it. And I

295
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,640
Speaker 12:  didn't say anything at the event and I can't find any information on this

296
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,480
Speaker 12:  anywhere. So I would appreciate an answer to this question. Thanks man.

297
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,120
Speaker 6:  To address Justin's question. We can confirm that the flip forward

298
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,760
Speaker 6:  does not support Samsung decks and we are very certain

299
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,720
Speaker 6:  that it does not support video out over U SBC, but we'll be testing

300
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,800
Speaker 6:  that in the future. So stay tuned, but

301
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:56,480
Speaker 6:  TLDR, I would not expect it to do what you're hoping it to do. Unfortunately.

302
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,360
Speaker 3:  Any idea why not Samsung has made this big deal about Dex for so long. This

303
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,840
Speaker 3:  is an odd line to pick, to not put it on.

304
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,080
Speaker 6:  So this is pure speculation here, but I think that when you are running

305
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:11,480
Speaker 6:  like video out over USBC on a phone and if you're running

306
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,960
Speaker 6:  a desktop environment like Dex or things like that, it's very taxing on the

307
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,920
Speaker 6:  phone's processor and it's taxing on the thermal system. And the one thing

308
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,720
Speaker 6:  with the flip phones is that they do not have as good thermal management

309
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,640
Speaker 6:  as the larger devices or the other devices. And so they will throttle their

310
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,560
Speaker 6:  processor faster than say a fold will or an S 22 ultra will.

311
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,040
Speaker 6:  And I know, I think PC mag did some side by side benchmark comparisons

312
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,400
Speaker 6:  with temperatures and everything like that. And they noticed that the flip

313
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,360
Speaker 6:  four was throttling faster than the fold four did. So that would be my guess

314
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:45,120
Speaker 6:  is it's a performance management system thing, limitation or

315
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,120
Speaker 6:  whatever, but it'd be it. Like I think his idea is really cool and

316
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,880
Speaker 6:  like, it'd be like a really cool idea if it did work

317
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:56,040
Speaker 3:  Just to confirm really quickly, the fold does support

318
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,440
Speaker 3:  decks. Right. And all the other H D I out stuff.

319
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,800
Speaker 6:  That's correct. Yep. Yeah. So the fold is like the full computer in your

320
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,080
Speaker 6:  pocket Delio, but unfortunately the flip does not.

321
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,840
Speaker 3:  Justin, when you figure this out report back, we, we wanna know. All right,

322
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,800
Speaker 3:  we have one more question before we go here. It is slightly different, but

323
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,280
Speaker 3:  we're gonna answer it anyway. This is from Gordon.

324
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:18,200
Speaker 13:  This is Gordon. Thanks guys. I have not received

325
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,120
Speaker 13:  a text back from the last two women to give me their phone number. Obviously

326
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,000
Speaker 13:  a man Android user. Is it time for me to just give up on the fight

327
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,120
Speaker 13:  for independent text messaging platforms and buy into an

328
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,640
Speaker 13:  iPhone? I wish I could say I'm not this desperate, but I am

329
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,440
Speaker 13:  definitely desperate enough to pay $3,000 to migrate

330
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,360
Speaker 13:  my entire digital life. Thanks.

331
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,320
Speaker 10:  I got this. Okay,

332
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,080
Speaker 3:  Alex, go,

333
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,160
Speaker 10:  Hey Gordon. I hate to tell you this, but it is the green bubbles.

334
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,960
Speaker 10:  I, I could confirmed this.

335
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:50,640
Speaker 3:  Wow.

336
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,720
Speaker 10:  Not with Gordon specifically. I had a friend and he was, he was having

337
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,520
Speaker 10:  trouble. He had at least two women say to him, it's your green

338
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,480
Speaker 10:  bubbles. I don't want them in my life. It could be the green

339
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,400
Speaker 10:  bubbles. It could be a wide variety of things going on.

340
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,000
Speaker 10:  Are you looking at the green bubbles on your phone more than you are talking

341
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,880
Speaker 10:  to the woman across from you? That could be part of the problem, but no,

342
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,880
Speaker 10:  I think it's okay to migrate because iOS is superior in the

343
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,520
Speaker 10:  United States and will help you a lot more than, than

344
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,120
Speaker 10:  Android will. But I think also if you love your Android

345
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:28,960
Speaker 10:  phone and a lot of people do at least like one person on the

346
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,600
Speaker 10:  Vergecast loves their Android phone. If you love your Android phone,

347
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,560
Speaker 10:  keep it because out there somewhere as a woman who loves her

348
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,080
Speaker 10:  Android phone and when you text her and you pop up that green bubble and

349
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,440
Speaker 10:  you're like, oh, here it goes. Here's another one she's gonna reject me

350
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,360
Speaker 10:  cuz of this green bubble, she's gonna go, oh my God, there's another one

351
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,840
Speaker 10:  like me. And that that's like a love connection right there for you.

352
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,720
Speaker 10:  So like honestly I think you should keep it. Don't don't change your

353
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,640
Speaker 10:  devices to, to try to get with a girl. Just focus on being really

354
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,000
Speaker 10:  awesome and cool. Which it sounds like you are and keep holding out for

355
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,880
Speaker 10:  that green bubble girl. Cuz I swear she's out there somewhere.

356
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,640
Speaker 3:  I just can't believe that we let you get through a whole thing after you

357
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,160
Speaker 3:  said, as everybody knows, iOS is just better than Android in the us.

358
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,640
Speaker 3:  That's just like a thing you said. And we're just, we're just cool with that.

359
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,080
Speaker 3:  Apparently

360
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,760
Speaker 10:  I'm out here speaking the truth, David, I'm just speaking truth to power

361
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,200
Speaker 10:  and the power is Android. I don't know what's going on.

362
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,240
Speaker 3:  Listen, I'm a blue bubble and my wife is a green bubble and we

363
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,200
Speaker 3:  mostly get along. Okay. Aww.

364
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,400
Speaker 10:  That's inspiring.

365
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:35,520
Speaker 3:  But here's what I wonder is, is the correct answer to just give them some

366
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,480
Speaker 3:  other, like, should you give them your Instagram handle? Should you just

367
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,040
Speaker 3:  be like, oh no, I use signal and then they'll be like, oh wow, such great

368
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,440
Speaker 3:  personal data policies and then fall in love with you even harder. Like like

369
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,680
Speaker 3:  is there a better answer than your cell phone number out there that we can

370
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:49,880
Speaker 3:  give?

371
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:53,880
Speaker 10:  Like I only use signal because I, I care about your privacy and

372
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,160
Speaker 10:  mine.

373
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:58,320
Speaker 3:  Yeah, exactly. Our love is end to end encrypted. It's like done lock it down

374
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,160
Speaker 10:  End to end encryption. Woo.

375
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,920
Speaker 3:  All right, Gordon, let us know how it goes. We're all rooting for you Dan,

376
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,040
Speaker 3:  Alex, Allison. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you.

377
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,560
Speaker 3:  We are gonna take a break and then we will be back to continue our testing

378
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,480
Speaker 3:  of earbud microphones because I just need to know if I bought the right

379
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,800
Speaker 3:  headphones. We'll be right back.

380
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,640
Speaker 3:  If you run an e-commerce business, this ad might change everything for you.

381
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,280

382
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:29,200
Speaker 3:  texts from major brands and wondered quietly allowed, what sort of magic

383
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:32,560
Speaker 3:  dusts are these guys sprinkling over their communications? Here's a secret.

384
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,680
Speaker 3:  They probably use Clavio. Clavio takes the mystery out of email and SMS

398
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:28,000
Speaker 14:  Big wireless companies have used confusing contracts to hide fees and

399
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,840
Speaker 14:  fine print and charge you more money for way too long. We've all seen it

400
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,840
Speaker 14:  happen. You sign up for a plan at the advertised price and then when you

401
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,240
Speaker 14:  get the bill, it's completely different. This is one of the reasons I signed

402
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,840
Speaker 14:  up for mint mobile. It offers premium wireless starting at just 15 bucks

403
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,440
Speaker 14:  a month. And I figured there would be some hidden fees, but I, I read the

404
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,520
Speaker 14:  contract twice and there aren't any and here's why mint mobile cut out

405
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,360
Speaker 14:  the one middle man, big wireless still relies on in person retail.

406
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:57,560
Speaker 14:  Every plan gets you high speed data delivered on the nation's largest 5g

Speaker 14:  number, just change your provider to mint OAL to get your new wireless

409
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,920
Speaker 14:  plan for just 15 bucks a month and get the plan shipped to your door for

413
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:28,760
Speaker 3:  Welcome back a couple of months ago on this show, I found myself with

414
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,320
Speaker 3:  a question which wireless earbuds should I buy to use for phone calls,

415
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:36,440
Speaker 3:  zoom meetings and all the voice dictation and chattering

416
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,240
Speaker 3:  with Siri. I do all day. We talk a lot about sound quality with

417
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,120
Speaker 3:  headphones, but I really just wanted to know about microphones. So I

418
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,960
Speaker 3:  sent verge of you or Chris Welch, who is a good sport to a coffee shop to

419
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,440
Speaker 3:  test out a bunch of different wireless earbuds to see how they sound

420
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,200
Speaker 3:  specifically for voice calls,

421
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,920
Speaker 15:  The outdoor seating. There are several people out here. There's music playing

422
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,600
Speaker 15:  overhead. Someone's like call directly next to me. So

423
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,960
Speaker 3:  The pretty clear winners of that test were the apple AirPods pro and the

424
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:07,960
Speaker 3:  Sony link buds, which both had the clearest detail in the voice

425
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,800
Speaker 3:  and took out a lot of background noise. I actually ended up buying a pair

426
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,520
Speaker 3:  of link buds after that test. And I have to say, I love them so far,

427
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,720
Speaker 3:  but I'm always looking for something better. And since that test two new

428
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,360
Speaker 3:  earbuds have come out. There's the Samsung galaxy buds to pro, which came

429
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,320
Speaker 3:  out at that unpacked event last week and the Google pixel buds pro. So

430
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,920
Speaker 3:  now obviously we have to put those new earbuds to the test, along with the

431
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,360
Speaker 3:  winners of the last round to see who is the current champion,

432
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,040
Speaker 3:  but we wanted to up the anti with the test this time. So we actually put

433
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,800
Speaker 3:  Chris on a boat. Like I said, he's a good sport. The New York city fairy

434
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,640
Speaker 3:  to be exact, which is a very noisy and chaotic part of the city. It has

435
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:48,720
Speaker 3:  engines, waves, people talking helicopters, wind.

436
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,840
Speaker 3:  It should be terrible for headphones. So let's see how this goes. Chris Welch.

437
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:53,200
Speaker 3:  Hello?

438
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,120
Speaker 16:  Hello. It's good to be back.

439
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:59,120
Speaker 3:  Tell me where you are right now. Your, your location and setup is deeply

440
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,760
Speaker 3:  hilarious to me at this moment, which we force you to do. And I'm sorry.

441
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,160
Speaker 3:  So tell, tell us where you are.

442
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:07,360
Speaker 16:  We are down at the wall street ferry waiting to get on a boat. Wanna

443
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,800
Speaker 16:  come up with a new way of testing earbuds. That's not the everyday, just

444
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,560
Speaker 16:  out on the street stress test. So we thought we'd go on the water

445
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,840
Speaker 16:  on a nice day. It's finally pleasant out in New York. Again, there's a helicopter

446
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,320
Speaker 16:  overhead. So we've got all sorts of

447
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,160
Speaker 3:  Things happening here. Yeah. We came outta the coffee shop test being like,

448
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,240
Speaker 3:  okay, this was good. But they all did like relatively, well, my big takeaway

449
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,840
Speaker 3:  was like great job earbuds. So it was like, okay, we need to like, let let's

450
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,520
Speaker 3:  break these things and see how we do. Okay. So which earbuds are we using

451
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,360
Speaker 3:  right now? How are we doing

452
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:38,280
Speaker 15:  Right now? These are the AirPods pro the standard bear for the

453
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,760
Speaker 15:  iPhone at least. And usually pretty competent, pretty good.

454
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:45,880
Speaker 3:  There's more sort of low level rumble than we had the last time where it

455
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,600
Speaker 3:  like it, it sounds like somebody is sort of breathing into the headphone.

456
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:54,120
Speaker 3:  Okay. So this is not great noise cancellation of the announcements

457
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,240
Speaker 3:  there. I was much more impressed at the coffee shop. This is rough times.

458
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:00,400
Speaker 15:  Okay. We're getting on the boat.

459
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,720
Speaker 3:  All right. It's bow time.

460
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,640
Speaker 18:  East river.

461
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,720
Speaker 18:  Yeah, the verge,

462
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:16,320
Speaker 15:  The guy at the ferry just said, hello. He wants to work at the

463
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,720
Speaker 15:  verge. We got a fan here. So that's good.

464
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,760
Speaker 3:  We didn't even plant that. That was amazing. While we're still here,

465
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,800
Speaker 3:  let's switch to, let's do the link buds real fast.

466
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:30,440
Speaker 17:  Bluetooth can. Now we're on the link buds. Hopefully they sound

467
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,680
Speaker 17:  as, as much. They sound love Luke.

468
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:37,320
Speaker 3:  This sounds like I can hear the noise cancellation happening all the time.

469
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,840
Speaker 17:  I can hear you pretty clearly. The knees are open earbuds. So I also hear

470
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,520
Speaker 17:  everything else.

471
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,120
Speaker 3:  I went back and forth on the open ear thing a lot. And I would assume that

472
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,000
Speaker 3:  as you get like onto the ferry, I'm, you're not gonna be able to hear me

473
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,440
Speaker 3:  at all when we try to do this.

474
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:54,200
Speaker 17:  Yeah. So we'll see how the engine roar treats these.

475
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:57,760
Speaker 3:  Your voice sounds better than you did on the AirPods, but it's slightly less

476
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,280
Speaker 3:  pleasant just because it's, it's like there's clearly way more processing

477
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:01,640
Speaker 3:  going on.

478
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,760
Speaker 17:  It's more gated.

479
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:06,480
Speaker 3:  Whereas I think the AirPods do a, they do an okay job of kind of splitting

480
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,600
Speaker 3:  the difference. That's why I'm curious to hear on the ferry, how hard these

481
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,960
Speaker 3:  things go and what it ends up sounding like, but just in terms of like raw

482
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,320
Speaker 3:  background noise, I'm getting much less from you now than I was with the

483
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,280
Speaker 3:  AirPods, which is interesting.

484
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,520
Speaker 17:  Good job Sony and the one.

485
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,960
Speaker 3:  All right. Do you think you can switch one more time before you get on the

486
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,320
Speaker 3:  ferry? How much time do we have? Sure.

487
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,120
Speaker 17:  We can give it a go. Should we do the galaxy buds next or the pixel

488
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,120
Speaker 3:  Buds? Let's do the galaxy. They're the newest ones.

489
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,720
Speaker 17:  These are the brand new galaxy buds to pro

490
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:37,760
Speaker 17:  just announced at the event alongside the whole four flip four,

491
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,920
Speaker 17:  $230, I believe. And so far I'm a fan of a sound

492
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,720
Speaker 17:  quality. This is my first rail call test. So we're

493
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,720
Speaker 17:  putting them through the ringer.

494
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,920
Speaker 3:  You sound bad. Yeah. Like I can hear you. I can understand everything you're

495
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:54,760
Speaker 3:  saying, but it sounds like you're sort of yelling at me like through a

496
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,720
Speaker 3:  pillow, if that makes sense. Okay. But I can hear everything you're saying.

497
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,600
Speaker 3:  And the noise cancellation is really good. I'm hardly hearing any background

498
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,320
Speaker 3:  noise at all. You just don't sound very good.

499
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,360
Speaker 17:  Yeah. There are people shouting. There's a guy in the bike riding around.

500
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,680
Speaker 17:  There's a lot of background noise. So if you're not hearing any of that,

501
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,360
Speaker 17:  that's good. But the pillow thing is less than ideal.

502
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,440
Speaker 3:  I will say this is the worst. One of the three we've tested so far. Okay.

503
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,600
Speaker 3:  But it's still it's again. It's kinda like where we were the last time. It's

504
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,200
Speaker 3:  like, it works. I wouldn't recommend like calling the president of the

505
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,520
Speaker 3:  United States from these headphones in this situation. But like it's, it's

506
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,240
Speaker 3:  fine. We're we'll it'll do the job.

507
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:30,600
Speaker 17:  Okay. Well, we're getting aboard the boat right now. So it's time to change

508
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,040
Speaker 17:  the scenery and the sound and see how we make out.

509
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:39,360
Speaker 19:  Yeah.

510
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:44,040
Speaker 3:  All right. We are, are now aboard the ferry and like, I can tell it got noisier,

511
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,920
Speaker 3:  but it's like, it's not particularly painful for me to listen to still.

512
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,720
Speaker 17:  Yeah. That's impressive. Cause in real life here, like we're right next

513
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,520
Speaker 17:  to the engine and it's just quite intense so I can hear you

514
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,160
Speaker 17:  still, but it's definitely just a constant roar.

515
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:01,240
Speaker 17:  So if you're not hearing that too badly, then all Samsung, I'm not

516
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,200
Speaker 17:  sure how often people work from the ferry boat, but we're not here for that

517
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,920
Speaker 17:  reason. We here to just show what these things they're capable of.

518
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,960
Speaker 3:  And I feel like it's like, even if you don't wanna work from the ferry, like

519
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,600
Speaker 3:  I had this literally yesterday, I was on Amtrak on the way home. And I had

520
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,080
Speaker 3:  like a three and a half hour thing. And it's like, it's another one of those

521
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,520
Speaker 3:  where it's like, sometimes it's very loud because there's announcements and

522
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,040
Speaker 3:  people are talking and sometimes it's like relatively quiet and just sort

523
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,920
Speaker 3:  of going. And so I feel like knowing that it'll at least be

524
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:29,000
Speaker 3:  okay, even when the noise is really bad actually is very useful for me.

525
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:33,080
Speaker 3:  Right. Okay. So before the ferry leaves and stuff gets crazy, even crazier,

526
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:36,840
Speaker 3:  let's switch to the pixel bloods pro and get, get our last quick test. Here

527
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:41,560
Speaker 3:  you are on the Google pixel bloods pro. Yes. How do you like these in general?

528
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,040
Speaker 3:  We haven't talked about this on this show yet.

529
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:46,560
Speaker 17:  Yeah. I'm a fan. We've got a multipoint to compare them to two devices at

530
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,160
Speaker 17:  once, which the AirPods and Samsungs and even the Sony of the world

531
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,800
Speaker 17:  cannot do. So that's a nice little thing. I've had a few calls,

532
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:58,240
Speaker 17:  indoors, you know, very basic stuff. And haven't had many complaints,

533
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,000
Speaker 17:  but how do they sound on a boat?

534
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,240
Speaker 3:  I would put these kind of right in line with the AirPods. Actually.

535
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:08,280
Speaker 3:  I'm definitely getting that sort of baseline sort

536
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,040
Speaker 3:  of white noisy hum. But not in any particularly

537
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,920
Speaker 3:  unpleasant way. And your voice sounds pretty normal. So I think it's, it's

538
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,600
Speaker 3:  trying to sort of split that middle ground too, of like not overprocessing,

539
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:22,600
Speaker 3:  but also not getting all of the noise out as a result.

540
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:26,160
Speaker 17:  Right. Okay. That's pretty good then considering, you know, that's Google

541
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:29,560
Speaker 17:  their last few year, but it's the pixel buds too in particular were pretty

542
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,880
Speaker 17:  terrible. So you have like none of the issues and the dropouts that was

543
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,360
Speaker 17:  had. So I've been very, very happy about that. Sound quality is great. We're

544
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,760
Speaker 17:  gonna have spatial audio later this year with the head tracking, all that

545
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,960
Speaker 17:  stuff. So yeah. They're definitely Google's best Friday yet.

546
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:45,160
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I'm kind of impressed. The only thing that is annoying me is there

547
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,920
Speaker 3:  is this one band of high pitched audio that's coming through. And when

548
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,400
Speaker 3:  you're not talking, it kicks in even harder. So it's like, it's, it seems

549
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:56,040
Speaker 3:  to be trying to figure out how to find your voice and not getting it quite

550
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,080
Speaker 3:  right. But then when you're not talking it's noise, cancellation is really

551
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,600
Speaker 3:  good. Apple was kind of pulling everything out, but like a sort of

552
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,560
Speaker 3:  subtle white noise. This is definitely, there's like a little bit of a screeching

553
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:10,520
Speaker 3:  happening. It's like the train car on the railroad tracks noise a

554
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:10,800
Speaker 3:  little bit

555
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,880
Speaker 17:  Interesting how like each company tunes their algorithms, you know, so pick

556
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,280
Speaker 17:  out certain frequencies. So I guess it comes down to preference or what

557
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,320
Speaker 17:  have you, but at least you can hear me pretty well.

558
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,600
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Can you hear me? Okay. How are you, how am I doing

559
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,960
Speaker 17:  You? Like fine. We're gonna stay on the boat and keep going to our next

560
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,040
Speaker 17:  destination on the ferry.

561
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,200
Speaker 3:  Wait, is the ferry moving?

562
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,520
Speaker 17:  Oh yeah. The Ferry's been moving.

563
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:33,680
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Wow. I didn't even hear the ferry start to move. I expected a big horn

564
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,280
Speaker 3:  or something.

565
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:38,000
Speaker 17:  We've got a big Enogen behind us, you know, but none of that's coming through

566
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,800
Speaker 17:  on the earbuds. So

567
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,680
Speaker 15:  Pretty good

568
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:43,080
Speaker 3:  While we're here. Why don't we go back and do the other two? Let's get the

569
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,480
Speaker 3:  AirPods in the Sony. So we have all four sitting at this table.

570
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,880
Speaker 15:  We're back on the AirPods pro we're still dark. So we don't have both movement

571
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,880
Speaker 15:  sounds, but still pretty loud. We were at the same table we were at before

572
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,480
Speaker 15:  when the buttons were super quiet when I was not talking, as you said,

573
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,880
Speaker 15:  so apple might left through a bit more noise.

574
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,880
Speaker 3:  I kind of can't believe I'm saying this, this, the pixel buds sounded better.

575
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:08,120
Speaker 3:  You can very much tell that apple is like obsessed with making your voice

576
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:12,040
Speaker 3:  still sound like your voice. Like you sound the most like you on these, but

577
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,640
Speaker 3:  as a result, I'm definitely hearing more background noise. Like I can hear

578
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,520
Speaker 3:  the people talking as they walk behind you in a way that the pixel

579
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:22,400
Speaker 3:  buds would not, I'm still getting that same kind of like high pitched wine.

580
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,280
Speaker 3:  So I think it's, it's kind of even with Google on that front, but like Google

581
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,040
Speaker 3:  is definitely more aggressive than apple on this front, but it seems

582
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:33,680
Speaker 3:  like almost as natural, I'm kind of impressed with the pixel buds here.

583
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,360
Speaker 15:  Interesting. Not what I expected. These AirPods are known quantity. They

584
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,160
Speaker 15:  will see what happens with the rumored AirPods bro too. I think that might

585
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,040
Speaker 15:  come around this fall. Cause we've been out for a while. It's time for something

586
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,040
Speaker 15:  new apple, I think. And I think we're getting close to it. Should we do

587
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,760
Speaker 15:  link buds now?

588
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,120
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Let's switch the link buds.

589
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,640
Speaker 15:  We're back to Sony's link buds so I can hear everything around me. I can

590
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,320
Speaker 15:  still hear you, but I can imagine like if we go off the top on the boat,

591
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,920
Speaker 15:  it's going to be very, very dire very quick. So for now

592
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,080
Speaker 15:  I can still make you up.

593
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:06,320
Speaker 3:  Chris. I have really disappointing news. What? These are not as good. The

594
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,920
Speaker 3:  pixel bloods might be the best one so far, which I would not have bet at

595
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,080
Speaker 3:  all would be the case, but this is like, it's still sort of that same thing.

596
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:16,960
Speaker 3:  It's like, it's trying really, really hard to process and I can hear it

597
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,880
Speaker 3:  happening. And so it's, everything is kind of coming up and then coming down

598
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,320
Speaker 3:  and then coming up and then coming down and everything is a little topsy

599
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:28,360
Speaker 3:  turvy. You sound more pleasant to me on both

600
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,040
Speaker 3:  the AirPods and the pixel buds.

601
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,640
Speaker 15:  Wow. Fascinating. Cause these were far and away the champion, like the coffee

602
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:37,640
Speaker 15:  shop setting, but here they seem to be struggling with all the factors

603
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,240
Speaker 15:  around, so. Hmm.

604
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,640
Speaker 3:  All right. Well, while you're still moving, let's let's go back to the galaxy

605
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,560
Speaker 3:  buds and see if they can come out of last place in this test.

606
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:50,720
Speaker 17:  Yes. The brand new galaxy buds, two pro buds pro two,

607
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:53,880
Speaker 17:  whichever you prefer. Yeah. Like I was saying before, the Samsung's best

608
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,640
Speaker 17:  sounding here buds yet, but from the noise cancellation is great. Almost

609
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,640
Speaker 17:  at Sony's level. Maybe it's just, just shy.

610
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:03,080
Speaker 3:  The noise cancellation on here is pretty good. Like I'm, I'm, I'm not

611
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,560
Speaker 3:  getting a ton of background noise, but you sound

612
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:10,760
Speaker 3:  by a mile. The worst of the four we've been testing here, it's

613
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:14,720
Speaker 3:  very muffled. And like you're talking to me through the wall of

614
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:14,920
Speaker 3:  mud.

615
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:19,320
Speaker 17:  Not sure if that's like placement or what differently, but yeah, it's

616
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:23,280
Speaker 17:  not great to hear two $30 on earbuds. You don't wanna hear that. You

617
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,880
Speaker 17:  sound like you're talking to bud.

618
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:29,280
Speaker 3:  Let's do one last test. We're gonna throw out the link buds and we're gonna

619
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,200
Speaker 3:  throw out the galaxy buds and we're gonna take the AirPods. And the pixel

620
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:35,760
Speaker 3:  buds pro up to the top of the ferry where things are gonna get even crazier.

621
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,960
Speaker 3:  And that's where we're gonna do our, our final test here.

622
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:41,720
Speaker 17:  It's gonna be windy. It's gonna be noisy. It's gonna be a very big test

623
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,680
Speaker 17:  for this. See who wins?

624
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,280
Speaker 3:  All right. We're on a moving ferry. Just went under the bridge

625
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,560
Speaker 15:  Beautiful day here in

626
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:57,960
Speaker 15:  hellacious.

627
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:03,000
Speaker 15:  It's a nice day. We're on, we're on top of the ferry.

628
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,120
Speaker 15:  Lot of folks,

629
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:10,160
Speaker 15:  it's a cool up here. So worst case scenario for any

630
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,640
Speaker 15:  set of your sort of being on the,

631
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:15,400
Speaker 3:  This is pretty bad. I caught about 80% of that. I would say

632
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:19,840
Speaker 3:  Apple's doing a good job here of making it. Like I suspect if it was just

633
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,000
Speaker 3:  unprocessed audio, this would be like unlistenable and I would've to take

634
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,760
Speaker 3:  my headphones off. So it's canceling out most of it. But unfortunately, that

635
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,400
Speaker 3:  also includes your voice. So I think we have officially reached the, do not

636
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,520
Speaker 3:  make phone calls on top of the ferry portion of the proceedings here.

637
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:36,680
Speaker 15:  So make phone calls. If we do gotta project, it's really loud and

638
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:40,560
Speaker 15:  we yell, just freak out the other ferry passengers and

639
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,000
Speaker 3:  Listen, the last time we did this, we scared everybody out of a coffee shop.

640
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,960
Speaker 3:  So I think the least we can do is scare everybody off the ferry today.

641
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,760
Speaker 15:  Shall we switch to the possible new winners?

642
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:53,240
Speaker 3:  Let's do it. I have high hopes. Let's see what happens.

643
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,560
Speaker 3:  All right. Pixel blood stress test.

644
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:02,240
Speaker 17:  These are the pixel buds pro top of fairies in New York city.

645
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:07,120
Speaker 17:  We are about to dock though. So it's not quite a fair comparison versus

646
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,840
Speaker 17:  I mean the engine's on no, but we're not full speed right now.

647
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:15,480
Speaker 3:  You sound substantially better than you did on the AirPods. I think

648
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,760
Speaker 3:  we, I think we might need to do this test when, when we're fully moving again.

649
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,720
Speaker 3:  Cause it's, this is usable. Right? Whereas the AirPods were like, I

650
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,480
Speaker 3:  would just hang up on you and tell you to call me later. But yeah, this is,

651
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,800
Speaker 3:  this is too good to be true. I think we're, we're gonna have to wait until

652
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,880
Speaker 3:  you're back out on the, on the open sea for this one.

653
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:30,600
Speaker 17:  Okay.

654
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:36,760
Speaker 3:  Looks like we're moving again.

655
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,720
Speaker 17:  We are at speed. Once again,

656
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,240
Speaker 3:  This is better than the AirPods. I cannot believe

657
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,040
Speaker 17:  This better than the AirPods. Okay. I'm coming through like no words are

658
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,480
Speaker 17:  getting cut off nothing. You're not losing me at all.

659
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:51,680
Speaker 3:  The AirPods were definitely clipping you occasionally. It was like, I

660
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,320
Speaker 3:  could get all of your sentences, but it was, it was cut. You were kind of

661
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,040
Speaker 3:  coming and going, but this seems like it's, it's pretty clean.

662
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,280
Speaker 17:  That's impressive.

663
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:02,720
Speaker 3:  Turn and face your head directly into the wind. Let's make this as hard as

664
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,840
Speaker 17:  Possible. Okay. Facing into the wind, speaking

665
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,800
Speaker 17:  to you at a fairly normal volume for a ferry, I can hear the winds in

666
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,080
Speaker 17:  the earbuds. So is that coming through?

667
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,320
Speaker 3:  I can hear you fine. This is insane.

668
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,080
Speaker 3:  I kind of can't believe it. That's worked. Like we could have a call like

669
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,080
Speaker 3:  this and I don't think I would ever be like, Chris, are you on the top of

670
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,040
Speaker 3:  a ferry calling me?

671
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,080
Speaker 17:  Well, that's what they do Google.

672
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:31,200
Speaker 3:  Like I would guess right now that you're like walking down the street

673
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,480
Speaker 3:  and there's like a breeze, right? Like, but that's, that's what it sounds

674
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,240
Speaker 3:  like. It definitely doesn't sound like you're on top of a very loud ferry.

675
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:40,600
Speaker 17:  There is a breeze. Alright. Yeah. This is impressive. I mean, I can hear

676
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,320
Speaker 17:  you. It's fine. Obviously the active noise cancellation is pretty good.

677
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:48,400
Speaker 17:  You get someone noise with all your buds that have that. I think. But by

678
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,640
Speaker 17:  and large, we might have found our favorite new pick for very

679
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:55,960
Speaker 17:  earbuds. So, you know, any kind of like extreme circumstances, didn't expect

680
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,160
Speaker 17:  a pull up pro to come out on top today.

681
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,680
Speaker 3:  All right. Well this is we've. We've learned something here. I'm now looking

682
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:05,840
Speaker 3:  sadly at my link bloods S and I'm like, do I, did I make the right decision

683
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:09,040
Speaker 3:  in buying you? I'm gonna, I'm gonna go look at Amazon for a while and just,

684
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,800
Speaker 3:  just see how I feel.

685
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:14,200
Speaker 17:  Okay. Well, we gotta find your way home. Now that can be office, but

686
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:14,880
Speaker 17:  this has been fun.

687
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:18,480
Speaker 3:  Well, thank you. Go back to quieter places and we'll we'll. We'll hang again

688
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:18,720
Speaker 3:  soon.

689
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,360
Speaker 17:  All right, sir. See you soon.

690
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:26,880
Speaker 3:  We're gonna take a break and then we're gonna talk about pickup trucks. Neil

691
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:30,760
Speaker 3:  Patel just finished reviewing the Ford F-150 lightning. And

692
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,600
Speaker 3:  I don't know anything about pickup trucks, but he tells me it's a big deal.

693
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:34,960
Speaker 3:  We'll be right back.

Speaker 22:  kitchen, you should look to the Moen smart faucet with motion control,

712
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:54,150
Speaker 22:  it's sleek, modern, and a totally touchless experience. Turn it

713
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:57,950
Speaker 22:  on and control the temperature of the water with a wave of your hand. Plus

714
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:02,190
Speaker 22:  it comes with voice activation and custom voice enable presets that allow

715
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:05,710
Speaker 22:  you to create common commands. So you can make your time in the kitchen,

716
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,390
Speaker 22:  feel more magical, learn

717
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,790
Speaker 22:  more@moen.com.

718
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:18,600
Speaker 3:  Welcome back. So I should confess this right up front. I am

719
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:22,160
Speaker 3:  not a truck guy, not even a little bit, but I'm

720
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,080
Speaker 3:  fascinated by the Ford F-150 lightning. Anyway, because this is Ford trying

721
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,920
Speaker 3:  to take its most iconic vehicle, maybe the most iconic

722
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,640
Speaker 3:  vehicle that anybody makes into the electric truck of the future.

723
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:38,000
Speaker 3:  And I think weather Ford can pull that off. Might say a lot about

724
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,760
Speaker 3:  the whole car industry's attempt to go. Electric Mitel spent

725
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,720
Speaker 3:  a bunch of time over the last several weeks, racing around upstate New York

726
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,440
Speaker 3:  in a lightning, hanging out at home Depot parking lots, because apparently

727
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,080
Speaker 3:  that's what you do when you're a pickup truck guy. And he wrote a review

728
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,840
Speaker 3:  for the verge about all of it. It's up now I'll put the link in the show

729
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,560
Speaker 3:  notes. And what surprised me most about it was that the Ford

730
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:01,640
Speaker 3:  F-150 lightning is a truck. Yes, but it's also basically just a

731
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:05,200
Speaker 3:  really big tablet on wheels. And I love talking about

732
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:09,000
Speaker 3:  tablets. So I told NEI that he had to come tell us about this Ford tablet,

733
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:13,040
Speaker 3:  whether touchscreens are the future of cars and whether Ford software design

734
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,760
Speaker 3:  can match its pickup prowess. Hi Eli.

735
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,360
Speaker 23:  Hey buddy.

736
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,560
Speaker 3:  So you're a truck guy.

737
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,320
Speaker 23:  One of the more surprising developments of my entire life.

738
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:23,640
Speaker 3:  Have you always been a truck guy? Like when, when did Eli Patel truck guy

739
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,280
Speaker 3:  become a thing?

740
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:27,800
Speaker 23:  Well, I've always enjoyed a truck. Okay. Like I grew up in Wisconsin, there

741
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,880
Speaker 23:  were trucks around. I've always thought trucks were neat. The idea that

742
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,440
Speaker 23:  I would own a pickup truck and then consider purchasing a second pickup

743
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:37,840
Speaker 23:  truck. That's pandemic. That's just pure pandemic outcome.

744
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:41,480
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I mean, pre pandemic NELI was much more interested in like an

745
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,440
Speaker 3:  unnecessarily fast BMW than a second pickup

746
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,720
Speaker 23:  Truck, city cars. And now I'm like country cars. Yeah, that's good.

747
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:52,320
Speaker 3:  Okay. So the reason I bring this up is we're gonna mostly talk about the

748
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:56,000
Speaker 3:  F-150 lightning as like a gadget, because I think that's how you mostly think

749
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,040
Speaker 3:  about it. That's how you mostly reviewed it. So we're gonna talk mostly about

750
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,520
Speaker 3:  that, but like real quick before we do put this thing in like

751
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:05,720
Speaker 3:  future of cars, context for me, cuz I don't, all I know is that

752
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,600
Speaker 3:  Ford sells a lot of F one 50 S and it would be good if they were electric.

753
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,120
Speaker 3:  I guess like this thing seems to matter a lot. Tell me why.

754
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:15,680
Speaker 23:  Yeah. I think that's the basics. So pickup trucks are the most popular vehicles

755
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,560
Speaker 23:  in America. The F-150 in particular is the most

756
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:23,520
Speaker 23:  popular vehicle in America for like 45 years running. Wow. And that's

757
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,480
Speaker 23:  not a consumer number. That's a vehicles in

758
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,320
Speaker 23:  America number that is contractors that is delivery people that

759
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,000
Speaker 23:  is fleets like people by F one 50 S for their

760
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,600
Speaker 23:  businesses, huge companies buy hundreds of F one 50 S at a time.

761
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:42,480
Speaker 23:  So the most popular vehicle in America, they obviously are huge.

762
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:46,600
Speaker 23:  They've gotten incredibly big over time. If you look at F-150 from

763
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:50,040
Speaker 23:  the nineties, they look teeny they're little baby cars. Yeah. They're heavy.

764
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:54,080
Speaker 23:  They have big engines. They have a lot of emissions from the big engines.

765
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:57,960
Speaker 23:  So if you can electrify that and in particular electrify it, not

766
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:01,880
Speaker 23:  for consumers, but for that huge number of commercial customers that

767
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,800
Speaker 23:  don't often drive more than 300 miles in a day. Right. So they can come

768
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,840
Speaker 23:  home and they can charge back at their depots. That's what Ford calls it.

769
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:13,040
Speaker 23:  You've like made a huge impact on emissions. There's just an opportunity

770
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,880
Speaker 23:  here to electrify a lot of cars at once, cuz you're aiming kind of at

771
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,280
Speaker 23:  the biggest part of the market.

772
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:22,440
Speaker 3:  Okay. So if I'm forward, then I would basically try to make the

773
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:26,560
Speaker 3:  F-150 lightning as much. Exactly the same as the

774
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:30,080
Speaker 3:  F-150 that has been the best selling car in America for 45 years as possible.

775
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:33,960
Speaker 3:  Like change as little as you possibly can. And like hope nobody notices

776
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,760
Speaker 3:  seems like a very good business strategy in that sense. And to some extent

777
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,120
Speaker 3:  that that almost seems like what Ford did here. Like almost, but not quite.

778
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:44,160
Speaker 23:  It's an F-150. My joke is like Ford literally did not redesign the wheel.

779
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,080
Speaker 23:  It's the F-150 steering wheel. F-150 seats,

780
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:51,840
Speaker 23:  F-150 body panels. F-150 windshield wipers. F-150

781
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,120
Speaker 23:  everywhere. Then some minor tweaks, the taillights and headlight have the

782
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:59,040
Speaker 23:  little led surrounds the interiors. Like depending on your view

783
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,880
Speaker 23:  of the touchscreen, a little bit nicer than the platinum F-150

784
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:06,440
Speaker 23:  cuz it's just been redesigned a little bit. And obviously it has that drivetrain

785
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,480
Speaker 23:  and it can, it can just go real fast in a way that very few F-150 S can

786
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,040
Speaker 23:  go real fast.

787
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:14,560
Speaker 3:  That's fair. The headlights thing. There are very few things in the world

788
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:18,680
Speaker 3:  that drive Anna, my wife, as crazy as like non-standard headlights

789
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:22,520
Speaker 3:  and taillights. And every time we drive at night, she's like, this should

790
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,960
Speaker 3:  be regulated. All headlights and taillights should have to be the same. And

791
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,760
Speaker 3:  the thing the Mustang does where it like the lights sort of tick outward

792
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:31,360
Speaker 3:  drives her. Absolutely insane. So I'm sure the F-150 lightning is gonna do

793
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:31,840
Speaker 3:  the same thing.

794
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:35,920
Speaker 23:  So one thing that's true across car design is everybody wants the cool L

795
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,240
Speaker 23:  E D headlights that are like really thin and look really neat. They don't

796
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,240
Speaker 23:  make enough light. So if you actually look at where the real headlights

797
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,160
Speaker 23:  are in cars, they're all over the place in place. They're like hidden. So

798
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,280
Speaker 23:  it looks like the cool lights are the lights, but then the real lights are

799
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,160
Speaker 23:  like hidden somewhere else.

800
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,000
Speaker 3:  There's just somebody shining a flashlight behind it.

801
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:56,480
Speaker 3:  Okay. All right. So the software is the thing, right? And it's like, everybody

802
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,760
Speaker 3:  seems to have decided that Tesla's idea of like, what if we just put a giant

803
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:03,840
Speaker 3:  ass portrait mode screen in the middle of the car is the

804
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,480
Speaker 3:  correct idea. And before we even get into the specifics of it, are we sure

805
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:11,120
Speaker 3:  that's the right idea? Like I'm just like buttons, buttons are so good.

806
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:15,440
Speaker 3:  Give me like dials and the, the F-150 you have, if, if I'm remembering right

807
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,440
Speaker 3:  from seeing your video is like big landscape screen and then a bunch of buttons

808
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,360
Speaker 3:  at the bottom and I'm like, that is the future I can get behind.

809
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:24,640
Speaker 23:  So my F-150 is a generation behind. Okay. So it's not the new

810
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:28,600
Speaker 23:  F-150 S the new F one 50 S have a 12 inch landscape screen, climate control

811
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,160
Speaker 23:  buttons underneath it. I have the older model, which smaller

812
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,600
Speaker 23:  tinier screen that really is just like for the radio. And then

813
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:40,200
Speaker 23:  buttons ever like fast tuned with buttons. And I'm in love with the buttons.

814
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:43,720
Speaker 23:  Give more buttons, I'll take the buttons. The thing you're talking about

815
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:47,240
Speaker 23:  cars as computers, it's not the infotainment screen is like the smallest

816
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:51,160
Speaker 23:  piece of that puzzle. So like a normal car from

817
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:55,520
Speaker 23:  early two thousands was actually like 19 computers. And those

818
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,760
Speaker 23:  computers are all built by various suppliers. And the job of the car maker

819
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:02,800
Speaker 23:  was to like, buy those computers and integrate them. And they would

820
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,240
Speaker 23:  integrate them using like a pretty slow networking standard called like

821
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:10,080
Speaker 23:  can bus or like, whatever. It's the big Tesla. Innovation is like,

822
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:14,240
Speaker 23:  what if the car was one computer? Sure. Or what if we designed all

823
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,640
Speaker 23:  those computers and we networked it all with like ethernet and like you

824
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,640
Speaker 23:  talk to car people, and they're like single twisted pair. Ethernet is the

825
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,840
Speaker 23:  biggest revolution in automotive. And you're like, what ethernet? You're

826
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,160
Speaker 23:  talking about ethernet. Right. But it's real that like, yeah, being able

827
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:31,040
Speaker 23:  to send more data faster, more reliably, ground

828
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,040
Speaker 23:  a car and control all the software, the pieces like you need an

829
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,040
Speaker 23:  interconnect for that. So Ford isn't all the way there. Like Rivian is like

830
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:41,960
Speaker 23:  a, is an all ethernet networked vehicle. They've written every

831
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:45,360
Speaker 23:  line of code in that car. It's the future in that way? It's the same way.

832
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:49,040
Speaker 23:  The Tesla's the future. The lightning is again right in the middle.

833
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:53,120
Speaker 23:  Like they have a drive train that's new. They want to do over the year

834
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,360
Speaker 23:  updates and be able to update the software all across the car. Still lots

835
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:59,680
Speaker 23:  of supplier components again, cuz you've got a bunch of F150 stuff, lots

836
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:03,000
Speaker 23:  of supplier components flowing through it. And the thing that is expressed

837
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,960
Speaker 23:  to you is like, oh, it has a big vertical touchscreen fair. So it's like

838
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:10,680
Speaker 23:  the touchscreen is like the last piece of the puzzle. When you talk about

839
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,640
Speaker 23:  the car as a computer, what they're really talking about is previously we,

840
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:18,600
Speaker 23:  we basically like lightly connected a bunch of individual computer,

841
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:22,280
Speaker 23:  like modules. And now we're the whole car is one big computer,

842
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:25,840
Speaker 3:  Which I guess is like, I keep having to remind myself like that counts as

843
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,680
Speaker 3:  a large innovation. It's like, well and everything else. We did this a really

844
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,560
Speaker 3:  long time ago.

845
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:33,480
Speaker 23:  Yeah. And like, if you really, the car companies, traditional car, they're

846
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,760
Speaker 23:  all on this. Like their executives will all use the business. Like we're

847
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:40,640
Speaker 23:  on this journey of transformation. And what they mean is we had no idea

848
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,280
Speaker 23:  how to write a line of code before. Right. And now we that's all we do

849
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:47,880
Speaker 23:  like to the exclusion of, we know how to make wheels,

850
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:52,320
Speaker 23:  like, like they can buy wheels. They're like, actually, what will differentiate

851
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:55,200
Speaker 23:  the cars is the software engineering in the cars, but they never had to.

852
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:59,760
Speaker 23:  There's a story about like VW. They launched this massive program to

853
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,880
Speaker 23:  write all software in the cars. And it was like this like 10 year failure,

854
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,040
Speaker 23:  cuz they're just not good at it in a way that a clean sheet company, like

855
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,840
Speaker 23:  a Tesla or a Rivian or lucid or whatever, they start by hiring the software

856
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:09,280
Speaker 23:  engineers.

857
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,840
Speaker 3:  I feel like given that this touch screen is like the thing we're gonna treat

858
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,240
Speaker 3:  this thing, like a classic like verge smartphone review. So I went back to

859
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,320
Speaker 3:  like 2012 and I found all the categories of our smartphone review and they

860
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:23,040
Speaker 3:  fit, they fit hilariously well into the construct of, of

861
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:27,040
Speaker 3:  this car. Yeah. So the first one is the hardware, which is just like

862
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:30,880
Speaker 3:  the, the thing itself. Like, is this a good screen? Do we like,

863
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:34,280
Speaker 3:  do we like the touch? Does, how what's the hand feel like you like?

864
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:38,360
Speaker 23:  Yeah, it's slow. It's a really fast truck with a really

865
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:41,360
Speaker 23:  slow screen. And I have this line that I've been sneaking into reviews for

866
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:45,120
Speaker 23:  years and got cut out of the video cuz I said it like

867
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:48,960
Speaker 23:  in a very frustrated way, which is that life is too short for slow computers.

868
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:53,040
Speaker 23:  And the F-150 lightning is like the ultimate example of life being too short

869
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,680
Speaker 23:  for slow computers. Like it's slow. The truck

870
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:00,720
Speaker 23:  is fast. Like at any moment you can crack a huge grin

871
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:05,200
Speaker 23:  by just going fast in this truck. Yeah. One of the fastest production trucks

872
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:08,920
Speaker 23:  ever made, I got into a race with a Corvette, held my own again, like a

873
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:12,680
Speaker 23:  brand new Corvette, stingray held my own in a pickup truck. That's cool.

874
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:16,320
Speaker 23:  Like that's really fun. Then you're like, I need to do anything.

875
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:20,120
Speaker 23:  I need to turn on the seat heaters. And you're like, I hate it. So like

876
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,240
Speaker 23:  there's just this big discrepancy in like when you're like the hardware,

877
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,600
Speaker 23:  like the truck is a beautiful truck. The front is cool. But the actual like

878
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,560
Speaker 23:  hardware of the screen, the screen is nice. It's, you know, retina display,

879
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:34,360
Speaker 23:  it's thick in a way that all automotive screens appear to be needlessly

880
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:38,280
Speaker 23:  thick. If you look at how it's designed is actually a little, it appears

881
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,160
Speaker 23:  to be off center because the sensor for blue crews is like next to the screen.

882
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,400
Speaker 23:  So like they've just like rejiggered the F-150 interior, everything about

883
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,480
Speaker 23:  it seems to nice. It's just slow. Yep.

884
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,400
Speaker 3:  Describe slow to me cuz there's like I pull down on a menu

885
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,680
Speaker 3:  and it, this sort of old Android thing where it would like lag ever so slightly

886
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,120
Speaker 3:  behind your finger, that's like one version of slow. Then there's the version

887
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,920
Speaker 3:  of slow where it's like, I press a button and seven seconds later or

888
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,400
Speaker 3:  something happens where on that spectrum does the F-150 like, because I would

889
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,880
Speaker 3:  also think this is literally like slow touchscreens are like literal life

890
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,720
Speaker 3:  and death in a car like this. Like it's, it's pretty high stakes time

891
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:15,040
Speaker 3:  to like make things happen when you press buttons. Like how, how slow is

892
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:15,480
Speaker 3:  slow here.

893
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:17,960
Speaker 23:  It's both of those things, but sporadically,

894
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,520
Speaker 3:  Oh, even better. It's unreliably slow.

895
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,360
Speaker 23:  I think the touch latency part is connected to this overall slowness. So

896
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,960
Speaker 23:  there are many times when you like swipe on the screen to like swipe through

897
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,920
Speaker 23:  the cards at the bottom and you're like, this isn't keeping up with me,

898
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,240
Speaker 23:  but it's not that the touch screen is like not registering your touch events.

899
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:38,440
Speaker 23:  It's that the thing is slow and it's not nothing's happening. So like in

900
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,080
Speaker 23:  a smartphone would be like, does it have 120 hearts touch, sensitivity response

901
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:45,880
Speaker 23:  or whatever. And it's like, maybe it does. But the computer is so slow.

902
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,320
Speaker 23:  Doesn't know what to do. So like as a touch screen,

903
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:53,960
Speaker 23:  it is slow sometimes. But I think that is mostly related to sometimes

904
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,800
Speaker 23:  you touch it and it just needs a beat. Right? Like I wanna switch on the

905
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,440
Speaker 23:  radio to the maps and it's like, what we're gonna do.

906
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:03,680
Speaker 23:  Okay. We're gonna take the radio away and it'll be blank for a minute.

907
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:07,360
Speaker 23:  And then let's go ahead and fill in the map window. And then

908
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,840
Speaker 23:  where are we? All right. Let's get, let's pull down the data for you're

909
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:13,360
Speaker 23:  located and then like draw on them. And it's like, all this is just happening.

910
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:17,720
Speaker 23:  Whereas you know, on a smartphone, you swipe between absence instant

911
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:21,080
Speaker 23:  and there are cars that are instant now. And this one is just slow.

912
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:24,880
Speaker 3:  And this is I'm skipping ahead to the software section of the review now.

913
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:28,880
Speaker 3:  But the, you described this well and I still can't figure it out. This is

914
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,320
Speaker 3:  like Ford software, but it's kind of Android, but it's gonna be even more

915
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,360
Speaker 3:  Android over time.

916
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,120
Speaker 23:  So it's not Android at all right

917
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:35,640
Speaker 3:  Now. Oh,

918
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,560
Speaker 23:  Okay. So right now Ford's main software is called sync and

919
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:43,440
Speaker 23:  sync has this like long tortured history. They've first built it with

920
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:47,240
Speaker 23:  Microsoft on windows CE, this is like ancient sync. Then they kicked

921
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,520
Speaker 23:  Microsoft to the curb. They've rebuilt it on some proprietary stuff.

922
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:55,120
Speaker 23:  I think there's some QIX in there. Like now four owns it. Then they've

923
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,600
Speaker 23:  updated it now to sync four that's sync fours in most of their cars,

924
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:03,040
Speaker 23:  the Mustang lock E and the lightning have sync four a, which is just portrait

925
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:06,800
Speaker 23:  sync. It has like some portrait features, I guess you could call it like

926
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,240
Speaker 23:  it's got those little widgets. And then what is the big move

927
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:13,120
Speaker 23:  is they're gonna toss all of that out. They've signed this huge deal with

928
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:16,680
Speaker 23:  Google. They're gonna rebuild all of sync on Android using Android

929
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:18,960
Speaker 23:  automotive and with Google services.

930
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:22,400
Speaker 3:  Oh, this is gas that we've been talking about. Google automotive services,

931
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:22,720
Speaker 3:  gas

932
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,880
Speaker 23:  It's coming. So this was a big deal. It took years in the making Farley,

933
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:30,400
Speaker 23:  just CEO, Jim Farley just signed this deal with Google. They're very excited

934
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,000
Speaker 23:  about it. They hired Doug field from Tesla and apple

935
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:37,360
Speaker 23:  to run all of Ford's EV stuff. And he is gonna be in charge of all this

936
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,880
Speaker 23:  software too. The problem is none of that's coming out forever. Like in

937
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,640
Speaker 23:  terms of lightning, the new cars at the end of 2023, we'll have this new

938
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,640
Speaker 23:  version of Android sync, but the lightning

939
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:52,600
Speaker 23:  probably won't get it. Why until there's a new generation of the

940
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:56,240
Speaker 23:  lightning. That's just my understanding. And I think even inside of Ford,

941
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,840
Speaker 23:  this is somewhat confusing. So I talked to Jim Farley when the lightning

942
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:02,360
Speaker 23:  first started shipping and I said, what's going on with Android? And he

943
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,680
Speaker 23:  said, yeah, you know, second half of this generation, then I got a call

944
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,280
Speaker 23:  from someone who would know. And they said, you need to change like the

945
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,600
Speaker 23:  electrical systems of the car to support the new software. So

946
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,640
Speaker 23:  like maybe there'll be like a mid-cycle refresh, but I don't think the lightning

947
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,320
Speaker 23:  or, or Maki in this form are gonna get it all that is to say like you're

948
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,040
Speaker 23:  using this software and you're like, man, this would be great if they would

949
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,760
Speaker 23:  update the software. But all of their software engineering energy

950
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:30,720
Speaker 23:  is pointed at the new platform. And so there's supposed to be some big update

951
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,240
Speaker 23:  for this version of sync coming. Don't buy anything based on the promise

952
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:37,560
Speaker 23:  of software updates, I think is always our advice. And this is like a pretty

953
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,920
Speaker 23:  good example of that advice because you know that there's a dead end here.

954
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:45,120
Speaker 3:  Okay. Slowness aside, it seems like car UI is very

955
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,400
Speaker 3:  much like an unsolved problem. And we've talked a lot about like CarPlay

956
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:52,560
Speaker 3:  plans to take over the universe on this podcast, which I continue to think

957
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:56,120
Speaker 3:  are fascinating and potentially insane. But just watching your video, it's

958
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:59,440
Speaker 3:  like Ford has a lot of ideas about like side

959
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:03,400
Speaker 3:  scrolling menus. That don't strike me as

960
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,360
Speaker 3:  like the way that I would like to interact with my car.

961
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:09,760
Speaker 23:  Okay. There are hours of me ranting about this software to make it into

962
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,680
Speaker 23:  the video. Let me, I'll give you one example. First of all, nothing is labeled

963
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:17,680
Speaker 23:  there's oceans of pixels in this car and like,

964
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:21,000
Speaker 23:  oh, like oceans, it has more pixels than almost any car I've ever been in.

965
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:21,400
Speaker 23:  It's

966
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,560
Speaker 3:  Like a 15 and a half inch screen or something. Right. It's huge.

967
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:27,160
Speaker 23:  It's a 15 and a half inch screen. And it has like 10 inch instrument cluster.

968
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:30,960
Speaker 23:  And like a lot of it to your point from before is like, they're just

969
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:34,640
Speaker 23:  simulating a Ford F-150 from 1985. Like

970
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:38,360
Speaker 23:  there's like lots of those like old school icons in the instrument cluster.

971
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:42,240
Speaker 23:  And it's just like, I don't, that's a picture of an engine, like, like sure.

972
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,240
Speaker 23:  Like I don't, I don't know what that means. Like here's the letter C next

973
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,520
Speaker 23:  to a thermometer. Like, you know, if you're a car person, like, you know

974
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:51,560
Speaker 23:  what these means, but like they made those icons cuz they, all they had

975
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,440
Speaker 23:  was like LEDs and they had to ship them to a hundred countries or whatever.

976
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:58,640
Speaker 23:  It's like dudes, you've got pixels just like right out engine

977
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,600
Speaker 23:  temperature, like whatever it's. So like there's just like an infinity amount

978
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,800
Speaker 23:  of that going on, which is even more frustrating when you see the size of

979
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,760
Speaker 23:  the screen. Like the instant Custer is basically empty. It's rarely full

980
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,600
Speaker 23:  of information, but it's a huge screen. Then you've got the center

981
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:17,320
Speaker 23:  screen the big one and like the top row of it has

982
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:21,240
Speaker 23:  icons in it that are just as inscrutable as like the Android status

983
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:24,840
Speaker 23:  bar. Oh God. Like there is one in it that, you know, that little like

984
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:28,920
Speaker 23:  asterisk sign that you see on the side of an ambulance. So the entire

985
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,800
Speaker 23:  time I had this car, there was that symbol with a line through it. And

986
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,240
Speaker 23:  I was like, is it just telling me I'm not an ambulance,

987
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:40,120
Speaker 23:  but like you can't tap on it. It doesn't tell you what it is. And I like

988
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:43,680
Speaker 23:  finally was like, what is this? And it, all it means is that 9 1, 1 assist

989
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,640
Speaker 23:  is off. So if you get an accident in the car will not call 9 1 1 behalf.

990
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:50,720
Speaker 23:  Totally useful piece of information to know, I suppose, putting

991
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:54,200
Speaker 23:  it permanently on the screen without any way to tell you what is going on

992
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:58,400
Speaker 23:  when you have a 15 and a half inch touch screen is ridiculous.

993
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:02,520
Speaker 3:  You could write out 9 1, 1 assist is off without trying very hard. Like that's

994
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,680
Speaker 3:  a, that's a thing screens do.

995
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:06,560
Speaker 23:  Yeah. It's it's right there. Then there's like two different connectivity

996
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:10,320
Speaker 23:  icons, one for your phone, one for the internal LTE radio. When you've got

997
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:13,520
Speaker 23:  your phone on the wireless charging pad, there's just a picture, another

998
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:17,240
Speaker 23:  little icon of a phone up there. And so like it just for all the world feels

999
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,720
Speaker 23:  like your phone is disconnecting from the head unit. When really it's just

1000
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:23,560
Speaker 23:  rattling around the wireless charging pad. Why? And then you like click,

1001
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:27,480
Speaker 23:  you would never know this to change any of the settings of the truck. You

1002
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,680
Speaker 23:  have to click a picture of the truck. Like there's a picture of the truck

1003
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:34,440
Speaker 23:  in the upper left hand corner. And you're like, yeah, it's the truck. And

1004
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:38,080
Speaker 23:  you would never know that almost all of the settings are buried in the picture

1005
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,360
Speaker 23:  of the truck. So you click on the picture of the truck. This is why they

1006
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,960
Speaker 23:  cut it outta the video. I just wanna be clear. I just did this fucking hour

1007
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:47,880
Speaker 23:  to a camera. It drops down a menu and the menu is

1008
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:51,720
Speaker 23:  divided into two sections. One is labeled

1009
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:55,400
Speaker 23:  settings and one is labeled controls and who, God knows the difference

1010
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,680
Speaker 23:  between these things. And then you like go into the controls and there's

1011
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,000
Speaker 23:  like little buttons and you clip between them. And then all of the buttons

1012
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,920
Speaker 23:  in those are labeled settings. And it's just like, what is happening?

1013
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:08,520
Speaker 23:  Like, did anybody look at this and like pay attention

1014
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:13,000
Speaker 23:  to what words we're using? Cuz we seem to be using all the words interchangeably

1015
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,320
Speaker 23:  as though they're a taxonomy of. And like, this is how we would review a

1016
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:20,000
Speaker 23:  phone. Like if we were reviewing a new operating system, we would go into

1017
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,760
Speaker 23:  this in extraordinary detail and be like the settings,

1018
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:27,520
Speaker 23:  the new version of windows have been moved from here to here. Like, you

1019
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,800
Speaker 23:  know, apple changed window management on the iPad. And we'd like, as we

1020
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:34,680
Speaker 23:  have, we would like hammer away at scrolling your mouse to the bottom, right.

1021
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:38,480
Speaker 23:  This open stage manager. And we don't do that with cars. Right. And I

1022
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:41,080
Speaker 23:  I'm just looking at this car. I'm like, if anyone did this to this car,

1023
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:44,080
Speaker 23:  seriously, you would just throw it out and start over

1024
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:46,960
Speaker 3:  The way you're describing. It makes it sound like they hired a bunch of people

1025
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:50,680
Speaker 3:  who had like deliberately, never looked at a screen before. And they were

1026
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:54,600
Speaker 3:  like, let's just start this from scratch. Like we know we have just decided

1027
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:57,960
Speaker 3:  as a society, like what a settings menu looks like and like, should it be

1028
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:01,440
Speaker 3:  the gear icon? Maybe not, but it doesn't matter. And we all know that's what

1029
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,440
Speaker 3:  it means. And it's like, we just don't need new ideas about how to get to

1030
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:07,480
Speaker 3:  setting venues. Like I'm, we're good on that front. Let's fix other things.

1031
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:10,920
Speaker 23:  Yeah. At almost no point does this thing trade on your knowledge of how

1032
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:11,400
Speaker 23:  computers

1033
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,400
Speaker 3:  Work, which is crazy because that's, again, it's like, this is the moment

1034
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:18,120
Speaker 3:  to, if you're ever gonna do the like skew more fake nonsense, that's just

1035
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,920
Speaker 3:  like, let's help everybody understand it as quickly as possible. This feels

1036
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,640
Speaker 3:  like the time.

1037
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:25,640
Speaker 23:  Yeah. But, and then on the flip side they've got all these like old school

1038
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:29,280
Speaker 23:  weird unlabeled icons, like in the instrument cluster. Right? Right. So

1039
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,040
Speaker 23:  like the part where you're like simulating the old F-150 and then on the

1040
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,080
Speaker 23:  other hand, you're like, what if we try to invent

1041
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:40,680
Speaker 23:  settings taxonomy from scratch? It's like, you're not, you gotta do

1042
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:44,600
Speaker 23:  one or the other all the way. And like in this case, I just think Ford

1043
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,440
Speaker 23:  is a little trapped between two worlds and they've got this like gigantic

1044
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,240
Speaker 23:  Android refresh coming where presumably, because they're working with Google.

1045
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:54,520
Speaker 23:  Well, I mean, it's not like Android status bar. So like a vast gen of clarity,

1046
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:58,320
Speaker 23:  but presumably they've got some people who are versed in user interface

1047
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:01,920
Speaker 23:  design, like helping them along the way. So it just, that part of it to

1048
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,960
Speaker 23:  me is like, I think I say in the video it's caught between two worlds. It's

1049
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,520
Speaker 23:  it's held back and it's held back cuz it's not going far enough in I think

1050
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,360
Speaker 23:  in either direction.

1051
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:13,480
Speaker 3:  That's fair. Do you figure it out eventually? Like it's, it's like

1052
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:16,360
Speaker 3:  part of this makes me think that like the best case scenario here is it's

1053
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:19,480
Speaker 3:  kind of like getting into somebody else's car where you like reach where

1054
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:22,520
Speaker 3:  the volume no is. And actually that's the temperature knob. But like after

1055
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:25,560
Speaker 3:  a little while you sort of get the muscle memory back and you figure it out,

1056
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,320
Speaker 3:  like, did that happen with the lightning?

1057
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:30,120
Speaker 23:  Yeah. It, you know, I end the video by saying, if I could find one to buy

1058
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,520
Speaker 23:  for a reasonable price, cuz dealers are working like crazy and they're hard

1059
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:36,400
Speaker 23:  to buy. I would trade in my gas truck. Right? Like the, the part

1060
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,640
Speaker 23:  where I don't have to pay for gas for a truck that gets 16 to the gallon

1061
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:43,600
Speaker 23:  on a good day. And it's faster than my truck. And it's like fun

1062
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:47,040
Speaker 23:  to have and the front is useful. Yeah. I would just try if I could get one,

1063
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:47,600
Speaker 23:  I would buy one,

1064
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:50,360
Speaker 3:  But that's a, like, that's a, in spite of the software

1065
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:54,240
Speaker 23:  In spite of the software. Okay. Right. It's not like a deal breaker. It's

1066
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:58,200
Speaker 23:  if you are the sort of person who pays attention and values, good

1067
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,040
Speaker 23:  software, this is gonna drive you bonkers every day. But it's

1068
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:05,560
Speaker 23:  survivable, which I think is like where the car industry has been for a

1069
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:09,240
Speaker 23:  long time. The thing you're describing is is it eventually

1070
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:13,560
Speaker 23:  just ignorable? Yeah. And the answer is yes. To some extent, like you're

1071
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:17,440
Speaker 23:  not gonna dive into the settings of any car every day and like mess with

1072
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,840
Speaker 23:  it. The thing that is not ignorable is the touch stream, climate controls,

1073
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:24,680
Speaker 23:  which are just the worst and they're the worst in every car and

1074
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:28,160
Speaker 23:  they should be illegal. And here you're like, I want to turn on the seat

1075
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:32,000
Speaker 23:  heaters and you're just stabbing at an unresponsive touchscreen

1076
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:35,720
Speaker 23:  and that's the worst. Or you're like, I wanna turn on the, the, I wanna

1077
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:39,680
Speaker 23:  change the vents and you have to like open a full screen menu with

1078
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,960
Speaker 23:  a render of the car that is split into three zones

1079
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:46,840
Speaker 23:  and like light up the zones. And you're like, my mom's car in the eighties

1080
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:50,440
Speaker 23:  had this solved. Like why are we redoing this? And then you look at the

1081
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:54,320
Speaker 23:  gas F one 50 S and they've got hardware buttons. And you're like, I coulda,

1082
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,040
Speaker 23:  this was fine.

1083
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:58,640
Speaker 3:  Yep. It should either be a dial that goes up and down or an up button and

1084
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:01,320
Speaker 3:  a down button. Those are the two answers. And those are the only two answers.

1085
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:01,880
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

1086
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:05,560
Speaker 23:  So like there's a part of it. That's totally normal. Like, yes, you'll be

1087
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,400
Speaker 23:  occasionally annoyed because you have to use the built in maps to plot a

1088
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:13,360
Speaker 23:  charging route slow, but survivable and I used it. Yes. You'll be

1089
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:16,440
Speaker 23:  occasionally annoyed because wanting to change the radio station while you're

1090
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:19,920
Speaker 23:  in the map requires an awful lot of clicks. Fine. It's annoying.

1091
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:23,880
Speaker 23:  The climate controls are like, I hate this. Like almost a deal breaker.

1092
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:27,200
Speaker 23:  Not quite cuz like really, they just want you to set a temperature, an auto,

1093
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:31,120
Speaker 23:  which I think a lot of people quietly do. So maybe not the worst depending

1094
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,520
Speaker 23:  on who you are. But for me, I was like, I hate, I hate all of this.

1095
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:38,040
Speaker 3:  Okay. Fair enough. Alright. Last thing on the version of you checklist

1096
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:41,800
Speaker 3:  before I let you go is cameras. And this is another one that fits oddly

1097
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:45,720
Speaker 3:  well in your experience of the F-150 lane. Tell me about the cameras on

1098
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,040
Speaker 3:  this car.

1099
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:49,200
Speaker 23:  My favorite thing about new cars is the cameras are getting really good

1100
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:52,920
Speaker 23:  and they're like super high resolution. So this is no exception,

1101
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:56,880
Speaker 23:  super high resolution cameras. Really nice touch screen. Like the cameras

1102
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:00,560
Speaker 23:  on my old F-150 are like garbage, like VGA,

1103
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:04,600
Speaker 23:  tiny, low res touchscreen. It's like, I think I'm gonna hit another car.

1104
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:09,000
Speaker 23:  I don't know. Maybe who knows this thing has like all the cameras all

1105
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,960
Speaker 23:  over the place. You get the top down 360 view. You can look out the front,

1106
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:16,720
Speaker 23:  big screen, all high res there's a little just, they're doing all kinds

1107
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,240
Speaker 23:  of weird camera, warping tricks to give you all these views. So there's

1108
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,360
Speaker 23:  a little distortion of the edges, but like it's me who notices these things?

1109
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:25,320
Speaker 23:  Not like our video people are like, what are you talking about? And I was

1110
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:29,080
Speaker 23:  like, look at the, the thing that kills me at the cameras. So again, on

1111
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:32,000
Speaker 23:  my truck, there's a hardware button above the screen. You push the button,

1112
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:34,960
Speaker 23:  pops into the cameras. You just do whatever you want. You push the button

1113
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:38,840
Speaker 23:  again. You change the views. Amazingly simple, amazingly efficient,

1114
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:43,160
Speaker 23:  super useful. This thing is like three taps into the cameras. When

1115
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,680
Speaker 23:  you put in reverse, it obviously automatically opens the cameras. But any,

1116
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:48,040
Speaker 23:  any other place you gotta like tap your way into the cameras.

1117
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:51,520
Speaker 3:  Do you have to like hit the truck and then like front truck front left truck

1118
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:52,240
Speaker 3:  camera.

1119
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:55,600
Speaker 23:  Yeah. No. So I think, yes. I think you hit the truck and you gotta like

1120
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:58,440
Speaker 23:  open the cameras and you got the cameras on the screen. Then you've got,

1121
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:01,960
Speaker 23:  you've got a landscape view at the top and then a 360 view of the truck

1122
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:05,920
Speaker 23:  below it and like a T shape. Okay, great. Then there's a little menu button

1123
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,920
Speaker 23:  in that bottom part and you click on the menu and that gives you all the

1124
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:12,720
Speaker 23:  views. So, so far like annoying, but not the end of the world.

1125
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:16,080
Speaker 23:  Like maybe too many clicks. Lots of touch screens, but big screen high-res

1126
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:19,200
Speaker 23:  cameras. Sure. So you're like maybe this trade off is worth it. Then you're

1127
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,280
Speaker 23:  like, you've got it. Open the menu to switch cameras. You pick a camera

1128
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:26,520
Speaker 23:  then for some reason that menu will just close itself all

1129
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:30,360
Speaker 23:  by itself all the time. So you're like, wait, there's so much room on

1130
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:34,160
Speaker 23:  this display. Why was this a menu to begin with? And then why does that

1131
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:38,000
Speaker 23:  menu hide to what end is this menu hiding itself? Cause it's not

1132
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,720
Speaker 23:  covering anything up. Yeah.

1133
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:40,960
Speaker 3:  It could show you so many cameras.

1134
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:43,680
Speaker 23:  It could, yeah. It could show you all the cameras all the time. You could

1135
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,960
Speaker 23:  open a camera and still have controls to see the other cameras. And it's

1136
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,840
Speaker 23:  just shit like that. That just drives me bonkers. It's like this truck is

1137
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:54,160
Speaker 23:  so smart with blue crews. It can happily drive itself down a bunch of major

1138
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:58,040
Speaker 23:  highways, incredible technology, like best driver assist I've used

1139
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:02,000
Speaker 23:  and it's on a mainstream truck. Very cool. And you're like, I just wanna

1140
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,240
Speaker 23:  look at the rear camera and it's like, no, we're gonna close that on you.

1141
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:10,480
Speaker 23:  Not at this time, sir. All of that just needs to like just an interface

1142
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:14,080
Speaker 23:  designer needs to go through this thing and do the things that interface

1143
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:17,440
Speaker 23:  designers use here are the things that people use most often. We're gonna

1144
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,600
Speaker 23:  promote those to the top of the interface so you can get to them quickly.

1145
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:24,680
Speaker 23:  Here's the things, here's the user pathways through all the rest of the

1146
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:28,360
Speaker 23:  stuff. We're just gonna organize that into a coherent system and we're gonna

1147
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:31,720
Speaker 23:  take all the garbage and we're just gonna like hide it in the back of settings.app.

1148
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:34,520
Speaker 23:  And everyone will be fine with that. And instead it's just like, what if

1149
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:38,200
Speaker 23:  it was a maze? There's no destination. It's like,

1150
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,480
Speaker 23:  I need you to stop it.

1151
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:43,800
Speaker 3:  What if you explore your truck through a VR render of your truck,

1152
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:46,160
Speaker 23:  You know that thing you do when you get in new gadget and you like play

1153
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:49,640
Speaker 23:  with the settings, like usually I find that to be just a, a delight.

1154
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:52,600
Speaker 23:  Like I'm gonna mess with this setting and I'll come back to it with this.

1155
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:57,160
Speaker 23:  Yes. Still a delight. You extremely fun, new gadget, many, many

1156
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:00,400
Speaker 23:  settings. But I, in the back of my mind, there's always the fear. I will

1157
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,320
Speaker 23:  never see this screen again. I have no idea how I got here

1158
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:05,920
Speaker 23:  and I have no idea how to get back.

1159
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:09,560
Speaker 3:  And in the worst case scenario, you literally cannot get home at the end

1160
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,040
Speaker 3:  of it. And that's just, that's where you are.

1161
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:14,120
Speaker 23:  Yeah. I mean, there's that? Well, that's like the charging thing, right?

1162
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:18,120
Speaker 23:  Like you've gotta fine. Chargers can charge a thing fast. And all of

1163
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:21,760
Speaker 23:  that happens in Ford's maps cuz Apple's maps and Google's maps have

1164
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:25,680
Speaker 23:  no idea of where chargers are interesting. And like where the fast chargers

1165
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:29,560
Speaker 23:  are and Ford has that information it's map. So, you know, one note I was

1166
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:32,640
Speaker 23:  anticipating about CarPlay and Android auto is like everyone in every car

1167
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,240
Speaker 23:  view is like, you can just use CarPlay and Android auto. Yep. And it's like,

1168
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:39,200
Speaker 23:  no, actually if you drive an EV you can't right. Cuz you spend an

1169
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,880
Speaker 23:  awful lot of your time on trips, plotting out your charging stops and Ford

1170
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:46,720
Speaker 23:  system for that is better. Cuz it's tied to the actual range of the car.

1171
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:50,360
Speaker 23:  So the car knows how much battery it has left. Sure. And it's just sort

1172
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:53,960
Speaker 23:  of plotting you a route and it Ford also knows where the fast chargers are.

1173
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:56,680
Speaker 23:  Cuz it runs the charging network in a way that apple and Google do not.

1174
01:06:56,740 --> 01:07:00,040
Speaker 23:  So every part of this is like, oh you gotta use their software again. Huh?

1175
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:02,720
Speaker 23:  You thought you could escape it. You thought you were gonna use CarPlay.

1176
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:03,720
Speaker 23:  Cool guy. No, thank

1177
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:06,680
Speaker 3:  You. So all this and you're still the coolest guy in the home Depot parking

1178
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:08,000
Speaker 3:  lot. And you still wanna buy one

1179
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:11,360
Speaker 23:  Old guys were wa wandering up to me just saying, congratulations.

1180
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:15,120
Speaker 23:  I've never had that happen with the review product before I was like, it's

1181
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,840
Speaker 23:  not mine. They're like take good care of it. I was like, again, we have

1182
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:21,200
Speaker 23:  to give it back. And he is like, congratulations, one more time. It's like

1183
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:24,400
Speaker 23:  a reverence around this trip. Cause one thing that is true of EVs is people

1184
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,280
Speaker 23:  know they're fast. Yeah. So you've got the fastest car in the parking lot.

1185
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:31,200
Speaker 23:  Like all the trepidation, like they'd ask me the range they be. Is

1186
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,800
Speaker 23:  it fast though? And be it's so fast. Like Ford's gotta hit. I think some

1187
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,040
Speaker 23:  of it will be fine. The software piece, if they really wanna make that turn

1188
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:42,080
Speaker 23:  into being the tech company, that it seems very clear. They want to do that

1189
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:42,840
Speaker 23:  is a long road.

1190
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:46,560
Speaker 3:  All right. Well good luck buying one. I know it's been a journey. So God

1191
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:46,880
Speaker 3:  speed.

1192
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:49,520
Speaker 23:  Yeah. We haven't even talked about that, but these things are being marked

1193
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:53,120
Speaker 23:  up by like $50,000. So we'll see if anyone has one, they wanna flip to me.

1194
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:54,920
Speaker 23:  You just let me know. We'll negotiate it.

1195
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:58,400
Speaker 3:  All right. NE's off to keep calling dealers about buying a lightning and
