22
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,810
Speaker 7:  Hello and welcome to the Road, the flagship podcast of loading your

23
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,770
Speaker 7:  dishwasher. Liam,

24
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,170
Speaker 7:  he won't do it. Our producer, Liam just told us this is a true story,

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,690
Speaker 7:  that he could spend a full hour talking about how to load a

26
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:51,490
Speaker 7:  dishwasher the the right way. Now he's, he's roll.

27
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,970
Speaker 7:  He's like rolling farther and farther away from his microphone.

28
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,890
Speaker 7:  If we ever launch a subscription tier of this podcast, it's just gonna be

29
00:01:58,890 --> 00:01:59,610
Speaker 7:  dishwasher tips.

30
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,050
Speaker 1:  I'm here for

31
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,850
Speaker 7:  It. It's gonna be amazing. We have a lot to talk about today. There's apparently

32
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,090
Speaker 7:  a difference between modern dishwashers and older dishwashers.

33
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,090
Speaker 1:  And drying aid is

34
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,850
Speaker 7:  A thing. Drying aid is a thing. It's a blue liquid.

35
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,610
Speaker 8:  The only thing I know is that everyone has their own way of loading a dishwasher.

36
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,570
Speaker 8:  If you are ever going to have a roommate or a partner, make sure that

37
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,890
Speaker 8:  you see how they load a dishwasher first, because I guarantee you won't like

38
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,210
Speaker 8:  it. But

39
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,650
Speaker 1:  Liam's way, the only right way. Yeah, I've been convinced

40
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,290
Speaker 7:  It's true. People say you should talk about money before you get married.

41
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,170
Speaker 7:  You should sit down and be like, all right, here's a picture of a dishwasher.

42
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,810
Speaker 7:  I want you to start free associating and let's see if this is gonna work.

43
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,930
Speaker 7:  By the way, new dishwashers have two propellers. Old ones only have one,

44
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,650
Speaker 7:  which Liam says changes your whole strategy. He's now turned his bat. No,

45
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,290
Speaker 7:  and I always looked at me.

46
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,610
Speaker 1:  If you haven't counted your propellers, what are you even doing? Yeah, why

47
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:44,970
Speaker 1:  are you,

48
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,250
Speaker 7:  Are you alright? Kranz is on vacation, but we have an all-star

49
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,050
Speaker 7:  lineup here. I'm your friend Eli. Alison Johnson's here. Hey Alison.

50
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:52,970
Speaker 1:  Hello,

51
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,170
Speaker 7:  Monica Chin.

52
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,450
Speaker 1:  Hey, I'm coming to you live for my very own camera.

53
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,210
Speaker 7:  It's,

54
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,720
Speaker 7:  I, we got some notes that turning on the cameras again

55
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,000
Speaker 7:  just alters our vibe. I agree. Which we know. And now

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,480
Speaker 7:  Monica's like it is because now I have my own camera. Richard

57
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,000
Speaker 7:  Lawler's

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,520
Speaker 8:  Here. No Nvidia effects.

59
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,120
Speaker 7:  Yeah. What are you doing man? They said,

60
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,840
Speaker 8:  They said it was illegal.

61
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,760
Speaker 7:  You can you we didn't, we didn't give the people the effects last

62
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,040
Speaker 7:  week. We had some technical difficulties. Here's what I'd like you to do.

63
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,200
Speaker 7:  Just turn 'em on randomly throughout the show and

64
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
Speaker 7:  we'll see people commit.

65
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Speaker 9:  We'll try and guess.

66
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,000
Speaker 7:  Yeah, we'll try and guess if you're looking directly at the camera or if

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,120
Speaker 7:  it's ai power GPU

68
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,360
Speaker 8:  Software, that is my eyes. I guarantee this. None of this has been AI enhanced

69
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,800
Speaker 8:  or written by chat. G P T

70
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,520
Speaker 7:  I would actually, can we get like a chat G P T version of me to host

71
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,360
Speaker 7:  this show? Because I, that would be great. Everyone knows my at this

72
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,440
Speaker 7:  point chat. There's enough training material for chat G P T. It's like he's

73
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,160
Speaker 7:  gonna bitch about atmos and then probably complain about the government and

74
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,880
Speaker 7:  that's the whole show.

75
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,880
Speaker 8:  What's Comcast doing

76
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,280
Speaker 9:  Week? It's G I 2.1 come up.

77
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,920
Speaker 7:  All right there. There is a lot of news this week. There's Samsung

78
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,880
Speaker 7:  Galaxy unpacked 2023. There's new laptops, there's the

79
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,640
Speaker 7:  new S 23 and S 23 Ultra. There there is some news

80
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,400
Speaker 7:  about the government. The government remains hopelessly

81
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,400
Speaker 7:  confused about the second industry and it's earnings. Richard and

82
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,000
Speaker 7:  the news team have been deep in earning season. We had alphabet earnings,

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,760
Speaker 7:  we had meta earnings. Mark Zuckerberg said the word efficiency on the meta

84
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,640
Speaker 7:  earnings call 5,000 times in a row. He went from the metaverse

85
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,480
Speaker 7:  to efficiency. So I would say things are, are going

86
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,440
Speaker 7:  strangely at meta. All the stuff. Talk about, let's start with the most important

87
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,480
Speaker 7:  news out of Samsung Galaxy Impact 2023,

88
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,600
Speaker 7:  which was an announcement. And I think that we all agree that this is the

89
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,080
Speaker 7:  most important news, mixed reality partnership between Google,

90
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,800
Speaker 7:  Qualcomm and Samsung.

91
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,800
Speaker 9:  It's a lot of

92
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,600
Speaker 7:  Companies. It's a lot of companies. They announced, it's,

93
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,680
Speaker 7:  the quote was, it's more of a declarative announcement that they will work

94
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,960
Speaker 7:  together on mixed reality in the future. But they are, they would like you

95
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,920
Speaker 7:  to be aware that at some point something will happen.

96
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,280
Speaker 7:  We're aware we're, I mean this was like a big deal, like a middle of the

97
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,240
Speaker 7:  event. Alice, you were in the room. They like stopped the show. They brought

98
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,240
Speaker 7:  on the executives.

99
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,480
Speaker 9:  Oh yeah, yeah. It was a full like Academy Awards

100
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,560
Speaker 9:  moment, you know, like closeups of executives. And then

101
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,200
Speaker 9:  they came on stage and they're like hugging and it

102
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,320
Speaker 9:  accepted speeches. It was so strange. And

103
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,040
Speaker 9:  then like it just instantly brought the vibe down and you could just

104
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,400
Speaker 9:  feel like everyone was suddenly like very confused and bored

105
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,600
Speaker 9:  and, and then Tiara was like, that's it,

106
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,320
Speaker 9:  we're done.

107
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,240
Speaker 7:  Yeah. They're like, we don't have any real plans. I was just gonna read you

108
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,720
Speaker 7:  some of these quotes. Each player is taking a leadership in each category

109
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,200
Speaker 7:  and then we'll be working very closely together across the different

110
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,120
Speaker 7:  categories. Like if I'm an Apple and I'm working on my headset, I'm like

111
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,280
Speaker 7:  shaking in my boots. I'm like, get to work you guys.

112
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,640
Speaker 8:  How is it even possible that they could have so little to announce? I mean

113
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,000
Speaker 8:  like Meta makes a headset that runs on some

114
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,040
Speaker 8:  variation of Android, right? Yeah. Samsung makes the displays that are

115
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,680
Speaker 8:  in the,

116
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,480
Speaker 7:  The Quest too, like in its basic level is a

117
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,400
Speaker 7:  mid-range Android phone you put on your face. Like that's what it is.

118
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,760
Speaker 7:  It has a Qualcomm chip, it has an OLA display. They're just like, it's so

119
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,160
Speaker 7:  tricky. I dunno. Some lenses it's just like bolt this thing in your face.

120
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:33,040
Speaker 7:  This is the future of all, all reality and it works. It's

121
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,720
Speaker 7:  very convincing. But that's like what it is.

122
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,440
Speaker 8:  And Google has been working on mixed reality hardware for years. They should

123
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,520
Speaker 8:  be able to fake something, right? They should be able to just make something

124
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,320
Speaker 8:  up and have like a shadowy box on stage and say that's,

125
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,440
Speaker 1:  I mean, ripped to the cardboard.

126
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,160
Speaker 7:  Yeah, we're here. Google's k Miyaki when as for common

127
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,080
Speaker 7:  added, we're excited to work with our partners to build a new generation

128
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,520
Speaker 7:  of immersive computing experiences that will further elevate what users can

129
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,640
Speaker 7:  do with Google. This

130
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,560
Speaker 9:  Really sounds like chat. G P T wrote it. If you

131
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,200
Speaker 9:  were like chat G b t, write an announcement.

132
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,120
Speaker 7:  So

133
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,640
Speaker 1:  Here's what, just add announcement in

134
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,160
Speaker 7:  General. Here's, this is what was coming out like here are the three players

135
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,440
Speaker 7:  in the Android ecosystems. Get 'em on stage

136
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,080
Speaker 1:  Together. I'm getting what you're gonna do with Google.

137
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,880
Speaker 7:  It's like, here's, so the reason I bring this up first is one, it's hilarious.

138
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,640
Speaker 7:  Just like fundamentally hilarious that they announced nothing.

139
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,360
Speaker 7:  It's good. It's, I mean, so

140
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,840
Speaker 1:  Now they're

141
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,000
Speaker 7:  All friends. It's, yeah, we're just like that. Yeah, that was the vibe. But

142
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,880
Speaker 7:  two, this was Samsung's first unpacked in person in a long time and like

143
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,920
Speaker 7:  I, I feel like this is a marker of a return to in-person events. Because

144
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,240
Speaker 7:  if you were not in-person and you're like, okay, here's what we're gonna,

145
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,880
Speaker 7:  we're gonna put on press release and we're gonna make a video. Like you would

146
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,800
Speaker 7:  get to the stage where you like hired a video crew to be like, make a video.

147
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,800
Speaker 7:  And the video crew would be like, what is the video about? And then he would

148
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,520
Speaker 7:  not do this.

149
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,080
Speaker 7:  You would stop, but you're in person. You're like, all right, we got everybody

150
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,760
Speaker 7:  together. Like the Google executive's gonna be here, the Qualcom, let's just

151
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,640
Speaker 7:  get him on stage. Right? Let's just take a couple minutes, throw 'em up there

152
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,840
Speaker 7:  and be like, we love each other. We got something coming. Watch out Meta

153
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,120
Speaker 7:  and then bail. And that's more or less exactly what happened.

154
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,520
Speaker 9:  Yeah, that was it. It was like that's the

155
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,320
Speaker 7:  Show Everyone's looking for the moment that they think the pandemic was over.

156
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,160
Speaker 7:  And I'm telling you it's, it's this kind of nonsense tech company

157
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,600
Speaker 7:  announcement that like we didn't, it didn't happen in the pandemic cuz you

158
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,760
Speaker 7:  couldn't, you couldn't take the next step.

159
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,880
Speaker 9:  Someone would've been like, no, let's not,

160
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,960
Speaker 1:  Let's condense this a little bit. The producer in the back let's

161
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,320
Speaker 7:  Like, like, like the grammar checker reporter is like, this is too many

162
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,080
Speaker 7:  extra words. Just like get rid of these. All right,

163
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,840
Speaker 7:  so that's that announcement. I'm confident that Apple's reality

164
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,880
Speaker 7:  OS team is panicking right now at the future

165
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,680
Speaker 7:  mixed reality efforts from Google, Qualcomm and Samsung. But there was

166
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,600
Speaker 7:  actual news, some really good stuff I would say. I mean I, I've got the two

167
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,520
Speaker 7:  of you here. The laptops perhaps more interesting than

168
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:56,960
Speaker 7:  the phones.

169
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,320
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I think that's fair. That rarely happens. Yeah, because of my moment.

170
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,800
Speaker 1:  Yeah,

171
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,400
Speaker 7:  This is shy like, like you got your own camera kid.

172
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,560
Speaker 7:  Let's get out there. Let's start with, let's start with a laptop WAN

173
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:13,800
Speaker 7:  book three Ultra It, you know, looks like a MacBook Pro but it

174
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,560
Speaker 7:  Samsung's pushing it this year with

175
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,040
Speaker 1:  This stuff. Samsung's pushing it. So there are five new models

176
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,600
Speaker 1:  which you know, everyone was a little overwhelmed when they saw there were

177
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,960
Speaker 1:  five until I explained to them that four of them are very boring and really

178
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,840
Speaker 1:  only one of them we care about. So there are

179
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,720
Speaker 1:  two Galaxy Books Pro and there are two Galaxy Books Pro

180
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,880
Speaker 1:  360 and then there's a Galaxy Book Ultra, which is like this

181
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,720
Speaker 1:  whole other thing. It starts at 2399. It has an RTX 30 50

182
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,280
Speaker 1:  or an RTX 30 70 gpu. It can have a core I seven or a core I nine

183
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,760
Speaker 1:  or 13th Gen Intel H series. They have

184
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,840
Speaker 1:  2 28 80 by 1800, 120 Hertz OLA displays.

185
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,760
Speaker 1:  It looks a lot like it's trying to beat the

186
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,240
Speaker 1:  MacBook Pro. It is a hundred dollars cheaper for the base model, which if

187
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,480
Speaker 1:  you're shopping at that price point is not that much cheaper. It's a pretty

188
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,720
Speaker 1:  similar price. It's hard to say that it's targeting the exact same audience

189
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,400
Speaker 1:  because a big part of this Samsung laptops

190
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,480
Speaker 1:  appeal is that it's for Samsung people who really like Samsung and it has

191
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,520
Speaker 1:  all these things with the Samsung phone, but it seems a little bit like it's

192
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,360
Speaker 1:  trying to do the same thing that you see on the Apple side where they have

193
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,360
Speaker 1:  all these different ways that the phone interacts with it. They have like

194
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,920
Speaker 1:  Samsung apps in Windows similarly to how they're like

195
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,200
Speaker 1:  iOS icons right now on my MacBook screen.

196
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,440
Speaker 7:  Wait what iOS icons on your MacBook screen?

197
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,280
Speaker 1:  Well like, you know, they have consistently been making the icons

198
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,760
Speaker 1:  more like the I counterparts over the past few releases.

199
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,680
Speaker 7:  You're not one of like the few people running iOS?

200
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,600
Speaker 1:  Absolutely. No God no.

201
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,280
Speaker 1:  Let's clear that up right away. Yeah, so they,

202
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,880
Speaker 1:  it's for the past few years the Galaxy Book line has been

203
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,120
Speaker 1:  this really like lightweight line. Like they're super, super light, they

204
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,600
Speaker 1:  have really nice screens and those are sort of like the two things about

205
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,040
Speaker 1:  them. Like they're really light, they have really nice screens. They're kind

206
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,720
Speaker 1:  of like, I guess the, the best use case I'm usually able to like

207
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,120
Speaker 1:  cobble together is like, you really wanna watch Netflix on the train. Like

208
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,960
Speaker 1:  it's in like that kind of thing. This is the first one we've seen in a couple

209
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,560
Speaker 1:  years that really is like, hey instead of buying the MacBook maybe you should

210
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,440
Speaker 1:  buy this now I have no idea how that's gonna go. But yeah, the

211
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,880
Speaker 1:  Galaxy Book three Ultra seems like it's, it's sort of a play for that

212
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,120
Speaker 7:  Category. So last week we were talking about the MacBook Pros with M

213
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,720
Speaker 7:  two PRO chips. I believe you made this comparison and then you immediately

214
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,560
Speaker 7:  apologize for making the comparison. The GPU performance was like a 30 60.

215
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:32,920
Speaker 7:  Yeah

216
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,240
Speaker 1:  70 37

217
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,640
Speaker 7:  Of the max on the max. So the M two max GP

218
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,160
Speaker 7:  performance, bad direct comparison but rough analog 30

219
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,120
Speaker 7:  70. Yeah this is an actual RTX 40 70.

220
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,040
Speaker 1:  40 70 or 40 50. Yeah. And we don't know how much the

221
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,560
Speaker 1:  40 70 model's gonna cost. We, there are a ton. We don't know how well it's

222
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,840
Speaker 1:  gonna perform. There are a ton of things we don't know in particular. We

223
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,640
Speaker 1:  don't know how good the battery life is gonna be and that is a

224
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,560
Speaker 1:  big question mark both because of the chips and because of the display resolution,

225
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,280
Speaker 1:  which is high because Intel doesn't have like the greatest track record with

226
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,160
Speaker 1:  having great battery life in the past year because Windows

227
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,840
Speaker 1:  machines with discrete GPUs really don't have good track records. Yeah. With

228
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,240
Speaker 1:  having any kind of battery life whatsoever.

229
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,800
Speaker 7:  So, or any kind of thermal management

230
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,400
Speaker 1:  Or any kind of thermal management. We have had some horror stories this past

231
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,360
Speaker 1:  year of laptops that have done discrete GPUs and done each series

232
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,040
Speaker 1:  processors and tried to be thin and have just like been blazing

233
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,600
Speaker 1:  fireballs that died after two hours. So, you know,

234
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,560
Speaker 1:  will this be able to overcome that Will we'll have to see.

235
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:40,480
Speaker 1:  I hope they can. Am I super optimistic at the

236
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,440
Speaker 1:  outset? No, I'm curious. I think it's ambitious what they're doing

237
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,920
Speaker 1:  but I'm, you know, I'm interested to see whether they can pull it

238
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,680
Speaker 7:  Off. So one of the, the things that is kind of interesting about Samsung

239
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,320
Speaker 7:  right now is they don't really own an operating system.

240
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,120
Speaker 7:  Like there's ties in. Yeah. Which runs on washing

241
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,840
Speaker 7:  machines and televisions. Right. That's great. Dishwashers,

242
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,760
Speaker 7:  I'm sure Liam. Liam do you have any opinions on dishwasher operating

243
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,000
Speaker 7:  systems?

244
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,960
Speaker 1:  Dishwasher ties in

245
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,610
Speaker 7:  Just mid middling

246
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,290
Speaker 1:  Ambivalent on dishwasher operating systems.

247
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:17,410
Speaker 7:  But you know they don't own Android and they've skinneded Android to Hellen.

248
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,570
Speaker 7:  Back to Google Chag. It was actually, this is the first Samsung event in

249
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:24,130
Speaker 7:  a long time where they actually made reference to Google existing

250
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:28,410
Speaker 7:  in any direct way, like putting them on station. Like here's a thing, announcement's

251
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:32,090
Speaker 7:  one thing. Even just mentioning that they exist is not normal for Samsung.

252
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:32,450
Speaker 7:  Right.

253
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,650
Speaker 9:  Yeah that was, it was unusual. I mean I saw

254
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:40,610
Speaker 9:  Deeter, I was like, what are you doing here? Like an agent, a

255
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:40,930
Speaker 9:  spy

256
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,530
Speaker 7:  Google spy.

257
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,530
Speaker 7:  Yeah. But they, you know, they don't own Windows obviously. Is

258
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,770
Speaker 7:  is do we have like a analog to de and Microsoft don't answer that

259
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:51,930
Speaker 7:  question

260
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:57,730
Speaker 7:  but they're building this connectivity between those two by heavily

261
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,370
Speaker 7:  skinny and modifying these operating systems. Is it worthwhile?

262
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,210
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I mean I was at, one of the things that surprised me was how easy this

263
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:08,130
Speaker 1:  stuff was to set up. Like cuz I assume like sometimes when

264
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,970
Speaker 1:  you have to set up like fancy windows stuff, it takes, it's just this

265
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,610
Speaker 1:  whole thing. You have to open up, you have to download all this stuff. You

266
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:18,050
Speaker 1:  have to like open up 17 different things and it doesn't work the first time

267
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,610
Speaker 1:  and it crashes. And that, I've had that experience many times setting up

268
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,370
Speaker 1:  different connectivity features. For example, razor,

269
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,290
Speaker 1:  this actually worked very well. We set up the QuickShare feature which

270
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:34,210
Speaker 1:  allows you to like drag files from the

271
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:39,370
Speaker 1:  computer to the tablet or to the Galaxy phone. We

272
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,690
Speaker 1:  set up second screen which lets you use the Galaxy tab as like a

273
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,690
Speaker 1:  external monitor like next to it, which like is kind of slow but works

274
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,730
Speaker 1:  and it was all like a one click thing and it worked pretty well. It seems

275
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:54,560
Speaker 1:  like something that could be useful, like if you're a real like Samsung

276
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:58,080
Speaker 1:  nerd who has all the Samsung stuff, which like I know some people like that

277
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,040
Speaker 1:  and I think it's, I think it could be beneficial. It seems

278
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,200
Speaker 1:  like something could be handy and it doesn't seem like it would be too much

279
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,840
Speaker 1:  of a pain. Which is a really nice thing to be saying about like

280
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:12,840
Speaker 1:  a Windows laptop using third party software to try to do

281
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,880
Speaker 1:  fancy things. That's like a refreshing thing to say.

282
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:19,040
Speaker 7:  We got an email from our reader over the weekend and had the word Bixby

283
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,800
Speaker 7:  in it and I was like expecting to get a note every now and again we get a

284
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,880
Speaker 7:  note from somebody who loves Bixby. But instead the note was about somebody

285
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,560
Speaker 7:  who had gone to their local animal hospital and a dog named Bixby had come

286
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,920
Speaker 7:  to the animal hospital and that's,

287
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:37,760
Speaker 7:  that's as much success as Bixby has ever had was gonna the

288
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,040
Speaker 7:  hospital.

289
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,280
Speaker 1:  That's the most favorable email that's ever been sent about Bixby

290
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,080
Speaker 7:  Too. I saw. And I thank you for that email and if you ever run

291
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,600
Speaker 7:  into dogs' names Bixby, please let us know. It's very important to me

292
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,040
Speaker 7:  personally. But that kind of like cross layer,

293
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,240
Speaker 7:  combine the phone and the laptop, that's what Samsung needs to compete

294
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,640
Speaker 7:  with Apple.

295
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,960
Speaker 1:  I think so. And I think there's also, it's, it's a similar

296
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,920
Speaker 1:  sort of philosophy to what I think Apple has been pursuing over the

297
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,240
Speaker 1:  past couple years with various releases of Mac os. Where it's

298
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,160
Speaker 1:  not only, it's been trying to make it just look more like iOS

299
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,040
Speaker 1:  not only in the way you use it, but just like in the way it looks. I think

300
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,120
Speaker 1:  even in the expense of some like functionality to some extent, like where

301
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,040
Speaker 1:  they put the control center now and like how the settings now look like

302
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,880
Speaker 1:  the iOS settings and not how like system permits used to look. And I think

303
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,600
Speaker 1:  you see this a little bit on these Samsung laptops, the way that they like

304
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,440
Speaker 1:  lay out the task bar and the way

305
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,920
Speaker 1:  that some of the UI and these Samsung apps look like, it looks to me

306
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,760
Speaker 1:  as close as like it could to

307
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,760
Speaker 1:  using a Galaxy phone as a computer. Like it kind of feels like you're just

308
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,520
Speaker 1:  putting the Galaxy stuff and blowing it up on a bigger screen. Which like,

309
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,960
Speaker 1:  you know, it's it, if you're a person who's really used the Samsung interface,

310
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,520
Speaker 1:  maybe that's a thing you like, on the other hand I hear from Samsung people

311
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,760
Speaker 1:  who use Samsung phones all the time that often like the Samsung apps are

312
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,320
Speaker 1:  not the number one thing about them. So, which is like not, which is a little

313
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,880
Speaker 1:  bit different from using Apple where like those, a lot of those apps tell

314
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,600
Speaker 1:  you use all the time so

315
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,240
Speaker 7:  Well because Apple prohibits you from using any other apps. Right?

316
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:08,680
Speaker 1:  So

317
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:12,600
Speaker 7:  Richard here Windows person is this, is this laptop calling your name?

318
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:16,800
Speaker 8:  This is, it's interesting. It it's it, as you said, it looks like a MacBook.

319
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,840
Speaker 8:  My main question is I'm looking at the hardware, you know, it's got the olet

320
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,560
Speaker 8:  it, this, this is a touchscreen of course. Right? Or at least you can't get

321
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,080
Speaker 8:  it with Touchscreen

322
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,640
Speaker 1:  Ultra I don't think is

323
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:28,640
Speaker 8:  Oh it's not. Well you, I I look at it and I, I wonder

324
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:32,120
Speaker 8:  if, if your Apple and you're looking at Samsung's laptop that they've put

325
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,480
Speaker 8:  together, they've put together this, oh let's green, it's got this, you know,

326
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,200
Speaker 8:  best in class sort of GPU CPU power. Is this

327
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,280
Speaker 8:  why we're looking at a 2020 five-ish MacBook Pro that's gonna

328
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,120
Speaker 8:  have at least some of these things and we, we presume probably more, more

329
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,920
Speaker 8:  GPU power and o and OED screen. Is that, is that that part of why

330
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,520
Speaker 8:  they're, they're inspired to change. Maybe they're looking at this and seeing

331
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,240
Speaker 8:  that some people might switch. I don't, I don't think most people would switch

332
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,640
Speaker 8:  from when, from Mac to Windows you once you've made your choice here and

333
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,800
Speaker 8:  there. Yeah. But you start to look at these things. Would would people say,

334
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,840
Speaker 8:  would people see that Olded screen and think actually that's a little better

335
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,640
Speaker 8:  than the laptop I have?

336
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,080
Speaker 1:  Yeah, that's interesting. I, my sense is

337
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,240
Speaker 1:  that Apple's a a big advantage of

338
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:15,560
Speaker 1:  what, of like what the new MacBook Pro 16

339
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,360
Speaker 1:  brings like is the combination of power and efficiency that it has.

340
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,000
Speaker 1:  Like it's not just that it's super powerful cause like we know we're gonna

341
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,360
Speaker 1:  have laptops in possibly including this one next year that like are very

342
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,320
Speaker 1:  competitive with it on power. But currently this laptop is bring this Mac

343
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,480
Speaker 1:  laptop. It's like bringing efficiency that just like no one else is bringing.

344
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,120
Speaker 1:  And those two things in combination are what really make it stand out. Not

345
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,560
Speaker 1:  like one of those things or the other. And I think the,

346
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,040
Speaker 1:  I just don't know about the efficiency on the Galaxy book. I think a big

347
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,160
Speaker 1:  advantage the Galaxy Book does have over the MacBook is that it's a lot more

348
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,080
Speaker 1:  portable. It's like, it's around a pound lighter I think than the M two

349
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,360
Speaker 1:  max MacBook and it's a little bit less than a pound lighter than the M two

350
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,480
Speaker 1:  Pro MacBook. But it's a lot. I would much rather have it in my backpack than

351
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,200
Speaker 1:  have like this chunky thing in my

352
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,800
Speaker 7:  Backpack. But then you have to take a battery with

353
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,720
Speaker 1:  You. Right. So that's the question though is how much is the portability

354
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,600
Speaker 1:  that the Galaxy Book has like mitigated by the fact that it's, it might

355
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,560
Speaker 1:  have no battery and therefore like what's the point of bringing it anywhere?

356
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,800
Speaker 1:  And that is something that I think, I mean if I were Apple right now, I would,

357
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:18,040
Speaker 1:  I would wanna know how well it's doing there before I know whether to

358
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,520
Speaker 1:  be scared. Because I do think that that is a big advantage that potentially

359
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,920
Speaker 1:  Samsung could eat into. But I don't know if it's gonna, I'm not optimistic

360
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,520
Speaker 1:  that it's necessarily gonna do that on that front. Yeah,

361
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:31,480
Speaker 8:  I think so the potential appeal of this laptop is a bit limited by kind of

362
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,840
Speaker 8:  everything I know about Windows laptops in general. So, so that, that's a

363
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,400
Speaker 8:  downside even for me. But

364
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,880
Speaker 7:  It does have an Nvidia chip in it. So you can run NVIDIA's eye

365
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,840
Speaker 7:  tracking software

366
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,320
Speaker 1:  That's

367
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,880
Speaker 7:  True on it directly, which is critical.

368
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:48,800
Speaker 7:  He hasn't turned it on yet. I'm, so I'm gonna get you to turn it on by the

369
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,400
Speaker 7:  end of the show. There's more laptops, there's just the regular Galaxy Books.

370
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,080
Speaker 7:  What's going on there?

371
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,440
Speaker 1:  So these are just, these are basically chip bumps. So these are more of the,

372
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,920
Speaker 1:  we've reviewed a bunch of these before. They are the Galaxy Book Pro and

373
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,840
Speaker 1:  the Galaxy of Pro 360, the Galaxy Book Pro 360 is,

374
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:07,560
Speaker 1:  they are kind of some of the few like 15 inch convertibles that are left

375
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:11,480
Speaker 1:  on the market. They are some of them, but convertibles in general have gotten

376
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,040
Speaker 1:  like a lot, there've been a lot fewer those released in recent years. And

377
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,560
Speaker 1:  we're seeing more people go for the sort of surface pro esque form factor

378
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,440
Speaker 1:  with their quote unquote convertible options instead. And when I ask companies

379
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,000
Speaker 1:  about that, they all just say like, oh, like no one's buying convertibles.

380
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,040
Speaker 7:  Oh no one puts their their computer in TP mode.

381
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,200
Speaker 1:  Yeah, no one wants to just have it as a tent on their, in their kitchen while

382
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,400
Speaker 1:  they're cooking or whatever. They put in the video advertise mode, not

383
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,800
Speaker 7:  Team mode, tent mode. Please don't cancel me for that.

384
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,840
Speaker 1:  There used to be a, a Dell XBS 15 convertible. There's not that

385
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,960
Speaker 1:  in the same form factor anymore. There used to be, there used to be a bunch

386
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,760
Speaker 1:  of convertible think pads that are now just clamshells. Those are not totally

387
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,600
Speaker 1:  govers, solely falling out fashion. This is still the Galaxo Pro 360.

388
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,240
Speaker 1:  Like one option you might go for if you're one of the like 12 people who

389
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,880
Speaker 1:  like really wants like a big screen thing that can flip around into a tent,

390
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,800
Speaker 1:  that's for

391
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,840
Speaker 7:  You. So you're gonna find it. That's, that's a good Samsung is for though

392
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,080
Speaker 7:  is like very hyper-specific niche products.

393
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,920
Speaker 1:  They have spen support, which is I think pretty crucial

394
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:11,000
Speaker 1:  if you have a, have a convertible, like you wanna be able to write on it.

395
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,640
Speaker 1:  And otherwise, I think the big upgrade here in addition to the processor

396
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,000
Speaker 1:  is that the screens have gotten a lot better. So one of the things that I

397
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,560
Speaker 1:  didn't like about the Galaxy Book lines of last year and the year before

398
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,320
Speaker 1:  was that they like very stubbornly stuck to the 16 by nine screen

399
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:29,640
Speaker 1:  and like Samsung's like a company that's known for making

400
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,000
Speaker 1:  good displays, like the displays should be like a huge draw of these panels.

401
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,320
Speaker 1:  And like before they just weren't, cuz they were fhd, they were 16 by nine.

402
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,920
Speaker 1:  So they've gotten a huge upgrade here. They have the 120 hertz,

403
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,840
Speaker 1:  they're calling it three K, but it's 20 80, 1800. There's no three

404
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,480
Speaker 1:  in there. They're not doing that. Yeah. And it,

405
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,240
Speaker 1:  so these, these

406
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,880
Speaker 7:  Are you any other odd numbered Ks?

407
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,560
Speaker 1:  There's not Yeah, one

408
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,160
Speaker 7:  K if you're gonna make up a K's,

409
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,760
Speaker 1:  I mean 5k.

410
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,680
Speaker 7:  Alright, five 5k. But there's only one that has

411
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,440
Speaker 7:  ever been 5k. Like an odd numbered K means you're off on your own.

412
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,880
Speaker 7:  Yes. You're just like off in the

413
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:08,440
Speaker 1:  No man here, there be Dragons.

414
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,120
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It's like, oh, I got a 5K display. It's like, yeah, you made a weird

415
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,400
Speaker 7:  choice.

416
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,440
Speaker 1:  Whatever. Yeah. So these are quote unquote three K displays a

417
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,240
Speaker 1:  lot of K's, three whole K's. But they, they look, they look very nice

418
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:25,400
Speaker 1:  and I, I think previously it was sort of hard to figure out like

419
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,800
Speaker 1:  where these might stand out, like what their niche might be. The big thing

420
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,520
Speaker 1:  was that they were super light. There's like now one more thing to like make

421
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,160
Speaker 1:  them stand out a little bit more, which is that they have the super nice

422
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,960
Speaker 1:  screen whether this will make these into MacBook competitors. I I

423
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,320
Speaker 1:  not

424
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,280
Speaker 7:  Saying is that just like all the, always the frame because Richard's point

425
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,080
Speaker 7:  that people don't switch back and forth, it's like more or less been true

426
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,480
Speaker 7:  for 30 years. Sure. Right.

427
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,600
Speaker 1:  I think, I mean I think that a question I get

428
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,400
Speaker 1:  from people a lot is like, I would buy the MacBook Air, but I'm like not

429
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,720
Speaker 1:  an out person. What's the MacBook Air alternative? And I think

430
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:01,680
Speaker 1:  that's kind of a currently kind of a power vacuum. Like there are

431
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,280
Speaker 1:  lots of different models that could vy for that, that MacBook Air alternative

432
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,920
Speaker 1:  spot. We didn't like have a decisive one last year. I said it was probably

433
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,920
Speaker 1:  a Zen book, but like it was so hard to get a MD powered things

434
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,400
Speaker 1:  last year that it was hard to recommend. Like this is one you could get that

435
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,920
Speaker 1:  you could definitely buy. I think this is, these are probably going for that

436
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,200
Speaker 1:  error pro alternative slot. They're super, super light. They're really portable.

437
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Speaker 1:  Generally they have pretty good battery life, which is like a big thing that

438
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,400
Speaker 1:  was lacking a lot of models last year that we really look for when naming

439
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:32,760
Speaker 1:  that, that contender. So whether these will be the best

440
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,560
Speaker 1:  one. See they are usually pretty good, but they're also, because they're

441
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,640
Speaker 1:  so niche, because like they're really, the thing about them is they're super

442
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,960
Speaker 1:  light and they have good displays and that's not, like, that doesn't necessarily

443
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,040
Speaker 1:  lend itself to a big mainstream demographic that I'd broadly recommended

444
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,880
Speaker 1:  for. So we'll see, we'll hope to hope to review these. But

445
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,600
Speaker 1:  I, I think that Samsung is by making these big

446
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,520
Speaker 1:  display improvements, is kind of trying to improve in the

447
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,360
Speaker 1:  place that they as Samsung are best able to improve them.

448
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,720
Speaker 1:  And I, I think that's probably

449
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,800
Speaker 7:  Stuck, right? I mean they're stuck with Intel's chips and Intel is having

450
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,760
Speaker 7:  like a disaster run. Yeah. Andy doesn't have supply like, well

451
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,520
Speaker 7:  they're like, all right screens. We own the screen factory. We'll do

452
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:15,840
Speaker 7:  screens.

453
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,600
Speaker 1:  Yeah, it's that. And the big thing they're pushing is the added continuity

454
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,440
Speaker 1:  features, which is sort of the other thing that they are best able to control.

455
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,000
Speaker 1:  The big speed, the big,

456
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,000
Speaker 7:  The Bigby

457
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,400
Speaker 1:  Experience. Like there's all these, the press release was like 75%. Like

458
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,160
Speaker 1:  here are all the ways you can use this with your Samsung phone, which you

459
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,800
Speaker 1:  could already do last year. We're just gonna repeat them. And then the last

460
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,720
Speaker 1:  paragraph was like, and also their new new display. This

461
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,600
Speaker 7:  Number, there's a laptop connection to this actually. Let's talk about Intel

462
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,240
Speaker 7:  just broadly for one minute. These are launching into a market

463
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:47,040
Speaker 7:  that basically is seen all the upgrades that are gonna happen,

464
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:51,240
Speaker 7:  all happen last year instead is, is this like, this just seems like

465
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,640
Speaker 7:  the weirdest time to do laptops,

466
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,160
Speaker 1:  Right? It's a weird time. Apples M two chips are really, really good.

467
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,720
Speaker 1:  Everyone else is really trying to make chips that are that good. We don't

468
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,320
Speaker 1:  know what's going on with AM MD supply. We hope it'll have supply. Yeah,

469
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,240
Speaker 1:  we don't know. We hope Intel will fix its battery life. We prob

470
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:07,880
Speaker 1:  we hope Intel will

471
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:08,920
Speaker 7:  To fix its

472
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,200
Speaker 1:  Company. We hope Intel will fix its company. There's lots of things we hope.

473
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:16,520
Speaker 1:  I think I within the next month or so, we'll we'll have some

474
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,560
Speaker 1:  answers. I hope so. But right now it's a lot of

475
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,760
Speaker 1:  crossed fingers that people can figure stuff out.

476
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,000
Speaker 7:  When do we expect to get these in info reviews?

477
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,880
Speaker 1:  I would hope the ultra they have not given us release date, but I would hope

478
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,800
Speaker 1:  it'll be soon. I keep asking it

479
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,320
Speaker 7:  Before or after the vaporware mixed reality headset.

480
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,200
Speaker 7:  Who

481
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,800
Speaker 1:  Can, who can

482
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,040
Speaker 7:  Say

483
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,280
Speaker 7:  I can't get over it. All right, we gotta take a break. We'll come back and

484
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,200
Speaker 7:  talk about the S 23, S 23 plus S 23 Ultra.

485
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,000
Speaker 7:  Are there more? S 20 threes Allison? That's it. That's it. All right.

486
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:52,440
Speaker 7:  At least three S 20 threes. We'll see if Samsung announces another one while

487
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,640
Speaker 7:  we take this break. We'll be right back.

488
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:01,540
Speaker 2:  Today's episode is sponsored by Aura. Here's the riddle. What's the point

489
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:05,340
Speaker 2:  of a sleep tracker if it's so bulky that wearing it keeps you awake? Lots

490
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,820
Speaker 2:  of stuff is trackable these days. Your heart rate, your steps, but you're

491
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,300
Speaker 2:  only gonna get something out of that data if you have a device you actually

492
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,820
Speaker 2:  want to wear. But the Aura Ring gives you personalized health insights, all

493

00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,220
Speaker 2:  sensor technology tracks, heart rate, calories burned, and your activity

495
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,940
Speaker 2:  levels. And then at night it tracks info on your body temperature,

496
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:31,060
Speaker 2:  sleep quality, respiration rate, and more. You get all that personalized

497

499
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,860
Speaker 2:  it is it just disappears. I forget I'm even wearing it. One small ring could

513
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,260
Speaker 7:  All right, we're back. Alison and Chrisman, we have not really talked about

514
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:40,260
Speaker 7:  this event, really their first in-person event in a long

515
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,060
Speaker 7:  time. You were there. What was the vibe?

516
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:45,980
Speaker 9:  It was, I mean it was full on, there was, you know,

517
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,620
Speaker 9:  the lights, the stage, it was a pretty big venue,

518
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,780
Speaker 9:  the Masonic Auditorium, which had a bunch of QR codes

519
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,660
Speaker 9:  that said like, understand more about free masonry. And then that kinda

520
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,540
Speaker 9:  weirded me out. I didn't, I did not scan any of

521
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:01,660
Speaker 9:  those.

522
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,900
Speaker 7:  Stand here for the Illuminati. It's good.

523
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,460
Speaker 9:  Yeah, I avoided that. No, it was really

524
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:11,380
Speaker 9:  kind of high energy, really high production.

525
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:15,900
Speaker 9:  It felt, and I haven't been to a Samsung event in the past,

526
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,420
Speaker 9:  but you know, apple was pretty subdued and Google

527
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,580
Speaker 9:  Pixel was like very small and subdued.

528
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,540
Speaker 9:  Yeah. And this was like, we're going all out Samsung.

529
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,140
Speaker 9:  Yeah. So

530
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,500
Speaker 7:  Did they have any Broadway dancers? There

531
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,580
Speaker 9:  Were no dancing. Oh

532
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,260
Speaker 7:  No. There was a time when like Samsung would be like full on like, here's

533
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,980
Speaker 7:  a cast of Billy Elliot, they're gonna dance about phones. Like truly some

534
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,300
Speaker 7:  of the strangest events in my entire life occurred.

535
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:44,580
Speaker 9:  Yeah. Okay. Maybe it was restrained then, because this is like

536
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,620
Speaker 9:  Samsung warming up too. They didn't have

537
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,580
Speaker 10:  Doors flying off their hinges at people

538
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,300
Speaker 9:  In the

539
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:53,260
Speaker 7:  Video. Yeah, like Apple has a vibe because they do their events

540
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:57,100
Speaker 7:  on their campus and like, you know, they play the, the, the

541
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,580
Speaker 7:  new age music as you're walking up to the thing. Like every Apple event

542
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,780
Speaker 7:  immediately starts with the energy of you might be raptured,

543
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,660
Speaker 7:  right? And like you can't touch, like the whole place is basically a museum.

544
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,980
Speaker 7:  You're like, not a lot like it just, there's an energy to an Apple event

545
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,820
Speaker 7:  that's very specific. Google is like, I dunno, should we be quirky

546
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,420
Speaker 7:  goofballs or not? Like, you know, like here our house. And then Samsung

547
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:22,260
Speaker 7:  has always just been like glitz, like pure glitz. Like Vegas

548
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:26,140
Speaker 7:  occurs with Samsung. So it's good to see they're all kind of like returning

549
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,460
Speaker 7:  to form. Yeah. In their way

550
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:32,540
Speaker 9:  I think. So this, yeah, this was, this was a full,

551
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:36,220
Speaker 9:  full on deal and, and they started

552
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:40,100
Speaker 9:  right off with the, the ultra and stuck with

553
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,160
Speaker 9:  that for a long time. Like

554
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:48,000
Speaker 9:  I was even like, wow, okay, I've, I've heard a lot about this at

555
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,600
Speaker 9:  this point. They got so deep into the camera stuff. I was

556
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,280
Speaker 9:  really surprised. Yeah. I made the mistake of writing in an

557
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,120
Speaker 9:  article that was on the verge.com. They will not say the words

558
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,280
Speaker 9:  full well capacity on stage. I was like, you know, there's cool things

559
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,680
Speaker 9:  happening with smartphone cameras, but they're just, they're boring. Like

560
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,120
Speaker 9:  you can't put them in a presentation. And they frigging said

561
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,080
Speaker 9:  full well

562
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,720
Speaker 7:  Capacity. They read your piece,

563
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,200
Speaker 9:  They, gosh. And I was like,

564
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:19,040
Speaker 7:  Like scrolling off stage. Yeah. Did this in here. The prompter

565
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,720
Speaker 9:  She'll really hate it.

566
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:24,640
Speaker 7:  So yeah. Okay, let's talk about this camera. They said ni

567
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,680
Speaker 7:  again, it's a 200 megapixel camera.

568
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:33,120
Speaker 7:  It uses all of those pixels in different configurations based on

569
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:36,880
Speaker 7:  lighting from what I understand, or ambient light conditions. What's going

570
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,120
Speaker 7:  on here?

571
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:41,040
Speaker 9:  So yeah, there really is, there really is the big story of

572
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,200
Speaker 9:  all three of these devices. It's, it's only the S 23 Ultra that has this

573
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:49,240
Speaker 9:  200 megapixel camera. But it's, it's really interesting.

574
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,840
Speaker 9:  There's, you know, there's other improvements in the camera system. There's

575
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,360
Speaker 9:  like the optical image stabilization is supposedly a little better.

576
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:59,320
Speaker 9:  There's a new selfie camera, all those little like tweaks and things

577
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,400
Speaker 9:  they do every year. But the new sensor

578
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:07,120
Speaker 9:  is really interesting cuz like, you don't need 200 megapixels.

579
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,920
Speaker 9:  Like nobody, nobody needs 200 megapixels. But that's not really

580
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,720
Speaker 9:  the point. It's like, like you said, it's doing, it's doing pixel binning

581
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:18,720
Speaker 9:  in kind of different configurations. It can do, you know, four by

582
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,480
Speaker 9:  four or 16 pixels, you know,

583
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,320
Speaker 9:  all grouped together to give you like the imitation of a bigger

584
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,840
Speaker 9:  pixel and in low light conditions. So

585
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:33,440
Speaker 9:  better light sensitivity, better photos in theory.

586
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,720
Speaker 9:  I'm gonna check it out. I, I took one 200 megapixel photos so

587
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,480
Speaker 9:  far and that's a lot of pixels.

588
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,720
Speaker 7:  You have to explain what full forewell capacity means at this point. My god

589
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,440
Speaker 7:  time. My god. We're all the way here. You started there. You gotta clo gotta

590
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,080
Speaker 7:  finish it out.

591
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:52,720
Speaker 9:  So the thing is like the pixels are so tiny on

592
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,120
Speaker 9:  this thing. It's like 0.6 micrometers.

593
00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:00,160
Speaker 9:  When the pixels are so small it's, there's just a level at which

594
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,800
Speaker 9:  they like can't capture any more light. They just, they're like

595
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:07,760
Speaker 9:  done full and you get, you get

596
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:11,360
Speaker 9:  oversaturation like blooming and and ugly stuff in your photos.

597
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:15,840
Speaker 9:  They figured out a way to do some magic that

598
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,800
Speaker 9:  I don't really understand and increase the capacity, the full

599
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,200
Speaker 9:  well capacity of the individual pixels.

600
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:26,680
Speaker 9:  So that's everything I know about full well capacity.

601
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:30,960
Speaker 7:  So they, they spend a lot of time on the camera and it's not just,

602
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,840
Speaker 7:  it's better low light performance or less noisy performance. Right. They're

603
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,040
Speaker 7:  they're trying to do a lot of additional things with the sensor.

604
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:41,080
Speaker 9:  Yeah. Yeah. And it's, I I guess dynamically,

605
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,840
Speaker 9:  you know, changing between, you know, you're always gonna get a 12

606
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,680
Speaker 9:  megapixel image when you're in 12 megapixel mode. But

607
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,960
Speaker 9:  behind the scenes it's doing some different things with those

608
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:56,120
Speaker 9:  pixels and binning or using more of them if you're in

609
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,880
Speaker 9:  good light. Yeah. Just kind of, kind of cranking up the

610
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,000
Speaker 9:  computational photography. Just that extra notch. And there's

611
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,800
Speaker 9:  just, there's other stuff that's really interesting that's coming out. There's

612
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,200
Speaker 9:  this app you can download called Camera Assistant and

613
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:15,680
Speaker 9:  it gets like really granular in the stuff that it gives you a bunch

614
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:19,080
Speaker 9:  more controls on the camera. It's, I believe for

615
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,520
Speaker 9:  S 23 and the S 22 series. But you can like,

616
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:27,480
Speaker 9:  you can override when it would switch from like

617
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,120
Speaker 9:  if you're using the telephoto lens in low light, it would typically switch

618
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:35,240
Speaker 9:  to the main camera and just digital Zoom cuz there's not enough light. You

619
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,800
Speaker 9:  can override that and you can be like, no, I want you to stick with the telephoto

620
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,320
Speaker 9:  all the time. It's like maybe a bad choice, but you can do that.

621
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,240
Speaker 7:  Bixby now lets you make bad choices. It's like, yeah.

622
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:46,880
Speaker 9:  You're

623
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,520
Speaker 7:  Like, that's can I have another drink? And Bixby is like, you can,

624
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,240
Speaker 9:  Right. Should you,

625
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,160
Speaker 7:  Yeah, we're not, we're not gonna stop you. Yeah. Like

626
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,600
Speaker 7:  Samsungs vibe all right.

627
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,120
Speaker 9:  Yeah. They're like, here you go. You wanna mess up your pictures,

628
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,280
Speaker 9:  you can do it

629
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:08,240
Speaker 7:  That level of control. Right. Samsung has sort of always offered it.

630
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:12,360
Speaker 7:  Is it, are they making the main camera app simpler? Because usually you would

631
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,880
Speaker 7:  just like offload that stuff to make the main experience way simpler.

632
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,440
Speaker 9:  Yeah. Yeah. And it is, it is like you have to go download it

633
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:22,360
Speaker 9:  and then all those settings will appear in the camera app

634
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:26,080
Speaker 9:  like settings. So yeah, they, they're trying to keep it like,

635
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,200
Speaker 9:  okay, you don't wanna do the deep dive, you don't wanna get it in the weeds.

636
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,840
Speaker 9:  Like you can just use this camera. But yep. It's kind of cool.

637
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,940
Speaker 7:  Is that the big feature of the Ultra? Is there anything else going on there?

638
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,660
Speaker 7:  They squared it off a little bit, which looks nice.

639
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:41,620
Speaker 9:  Yeah. Oh I, yeah, I like it. Maybe I just, I

640
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:44,700
Speaker 9:  spend too much time like holding phones and thinking about them.

641
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,820
Speaker 9:  I'm like welcome

642
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,260
Speaker 7:  To the verse

643
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:51,180
Speaker 9:  Cast. Oh my gosh. Yeah. I'm like, if I, I

644
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:55,020
Speaker 9:  sound crazy when I try and explain it. I'm like, well it's like a tiny

645
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,620
Speaker 9:  bit more flat on the sides and my husband's like, this is

646
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,140
Speaker 7:  Probably the one place. But that's

647
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,820
Speaker 1:  A big feel. Cause I feel like all the only thing I associate these phones

648
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,340
Speaker 1:  with basically, or the big thing I did was like how round they were on the

649
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,860
Speaker 1:  sides. Like, like super

650
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:12,740
Speaker 9:  Round. It sucks. You're like, and cuz you're trying to use a

651
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:16,660
Speaker 9:  pen and it like keeps going over the edge. Right. Cuz it's like an infinity

652
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,540
Speaker 9:  pool of screen. So yeah, they, the sides are a

653
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,980
Speaker 9:  little more squared off this time. I like it. I think it looks kind of fancy.

654
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:28,340
Speaker 9:  I like the cream color. Twitter's yelling me about how they

655
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,780
Speaker 9:  don't like cream color, but I'll die on that hill.

656
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:34,540
Speaker 7:  I mean at this point Twitter's just like a collection of like Elon in his

657
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,000
Speaker 7:  spots. Yeah. Like Elon doesn't like cream and like that's Twitter.

658
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:40,720
Speaker 9:  There's just a whole bunch of bots are yelling at me.

659
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,520
Speaker 7:  $1,200 is crazy for this phone.

660
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:48,680
Speaker 9:  Yeah. Which is the same as last year. So at this point

661
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,120
Speaker 9:  we're like, well it didn't get more expensive so that's good. But you do

662
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:56,040
Speaker 9:  get a higher storage capacity at the

663
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,760
Speaker 9:  base model. It's 256 now for 1199.

664
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:03,160
Speaker 9:  So that's good. But other things I didn't mention, there's

665
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,160
Speaker 9:  across the whole series there's a new, there's obviously a new Snap Dragon

666
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,240
Speaker 9:  eight gen two processor. It's like technically a

667
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:15,080
Speaker 9:  very slightly different version that's like special for

668
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,760
Speaker 9:  Samsung. It has just kind of like a higher

669
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,680
Speaker 9:  performance ceiling

670
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,640
Speaker 7:  Has no, it has a name. I'm just gonna read the name. The name is Snapdragon

671
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,440
Speaker 7:  eight gen two for Galaxy.

672
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,040
Speaker 9:  Yeah. It's

673
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,560
Speaker 1:  Like similar to Microsoft's like little fancy Microsoft processors they have

674
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,600
Speaker 1:  in all their surface books. No, it's four

675
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,960
Speaker 7:  Microsoft. Yeah. It's like Qualcomm was like, we turn it up a little bit.

676
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,200
Speaker 7:  It's for you, it's for Galaxy.

677
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,120
Speaker 9:  Yeah. It's special. Yeah, sure. Yeah.

678
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,760
Speaker 7:  The bigger deal is that they're using it worldwide, right?

679
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:48,760
Speaker 9:  Yeah, yeah. There's no more, you know, some areas get

680
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,720
Speaker 9:  the snap dragon, some get the XOs chip, it's every phone everywhere.

681
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,120
Speaker 9:  All at once has the Snap dragon. That's

682
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,840
Speaker 7:  Really unusual.

683
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,880
Speaker 7:  Something going on with X N S trips. I guess we don't really get them in

684
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,600
Speaker 7:  in the United States, so I've never really known what's going on with x n

685
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,160
Speaker 7:  s chips. Yeah. Like I read foreign publications and they're like this do,

686
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,280
Speaker 7:  and I'm like, great the speed test, but I can't use one.

687
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:12,160
Speaker 7:  Like it's like illegal to use one here.

688
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:16,320
Speaker 9:  I think there was like one or two mid-range phones I looked at that they

689
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:20,160
Speaker 9:  just kind of threw the XOs in and there was really, it was just very quiet.

690
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,880
Speaker 9:  They're like, oh yeah,

691
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,000
Speaker 1:  Gotta clear out their closet.

692
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,640
Speaker 9:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe they were lying around. I don't know.

693
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,640
Speaker 7:  They're like, can you make XOs for Galaxy? And Samsung was like, no. And

694
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,320
Speaker 7:  it's like, but you're

695
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,640
Speaker 9:  Meos for me.

696
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:37,840
Speaker 7:  So it seems like running through Ultra on the whole pretty incremental,

697
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,840
Speaker 7:  right? We've, we've seen a pixel bending camera from Samsung before. It was

698
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,640
Speaker 7:  really good. I think we Becca's big camera test last year.

699
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,880
Speaker 7:  She said the S 22 Ultra was the be her favorite camera. Yeah. The best in

700
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,880
Speaker 7:  this context is a very subjective thing to say. It was Becca's favorite camera.

701
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,280
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And Becca's the best camera viewer. So I think you can just close those,

702
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,160
Speaker 7:  those dots together. But this seems like the next step

703
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,560
Speaker 7:  of a big pixel binning sensor, not a radical step.

704
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:06,000
Speaker 9:  Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's all pretty incremental and

705
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:10,240
Speaker 9:  like I, I do think it's interesting like what they had to

706
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,840
Speaker 9:  do to get here, like to get to 200 megapixels and

707
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:17,520
Speaker 9:  the little tweaks under the hood are interesting. But yeah, at the end of

708
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,360
Speaker 9:  the day it's like, it is a pixel bidding camera. It's got a

709
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,760
Speaker 9:  newer chip. It has like slightly better gorilla glass

710
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,160
Speaker 9:  and but the square, it's square.

711
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,440
Speaker 7:  The head square square though that's where we're our phones are like this

712
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,400
Speaker 7:  black rectangle is squared off on the sides and no satellites And

713
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,080
Speaker 7:  no satellites.

714
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,240
Speaker 9:  Not satellites for Samsung

715
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,000
Speaker 7:  Because

716
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,040
Speaker 8:  Samsung cares about things being ready before they put them in their devices.

717
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,440
Speaker 8:  Sudden.

718
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,520
Speaker 9:  Yeah. You wouldn't think they would just throw stuff at the

719
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,480
Speaker 9:  wall like that would

720
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,240
Speaker 7:  You? Samsung and Qualcomm together? No, they never just

721
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,480
Speaker 7:  announced nothing on a stage.

722
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:58,160
Speaker 7:  We do that. The satellite thing is on the whole, I find

723
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,240
Speaker 7:  the Apple commercials about sos to be extremely weird,

724
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,600
Speaker 7:  you know and like I get that it works and I'm, if

725
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,680
Speaker 9:  You don't have this, you're gonna die

726
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,720
Speaker 7:  Immediately. Yeah. It's like the one commercial where they're on the mountain

727
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:13,040
Speaker 7:  in the helicopter comes like this would be, yes. I'm appreciative that

728
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,240
Speaker 7:  this exists. This is the weirdest commercial to be watching in the middle

729
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,000
Speaker 7:  of football. Like it's just like things get real dark for

730
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,720
Speaker 7:  30 seconds and you're out and you're like, oh you're not. I look at my phone,

731
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,280
Speaker 7:  I'm like, one day you'll save my but

732
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,080
Speaker 9:  Right.

733
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,640
Speaker 7:  It's just weird.

734
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:31,360
Speaker 9:  Yeah. Us us 23 Ultras just gonna leave me in the woods.

735
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,360
Speaker 7:  Yeah, you're

736
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,800
Speaker 9:  Doomed. It's just gonna be I'm be done.

737
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,280
Speaker 7:  Well you, you can fire off all 200 megapixels at once. I hope you don't like

738
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,320
Speaker 7:  staying alive Alison.

739
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,200
Speaker 9:  Yeah. Oh god.

740
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:43,320
Speaker 7:  So the satellite stuff is there. I don't think those networks are built out

741
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,280
Speaker 7:  yet. Even like Apple's network is still pretty low bandwidth. You can

742
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,800
Speaker 7:  see why on a very expensive phone, they're not adding more costs to it

743
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,720
Speaker 7:  until it means something to people. Whereas Apple

744
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,520
Speaker 7:  just needed to differentiate it and best we get cart like Apple is like,

745
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,080
Speaker 7:  we'll just scare people in the buying phones this year. Like if you're close

746
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,440
Speaker 7:  to death iPhone, that's weird for them. That's their positioning.

747
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,160
Speaker 7:  Maybe you looked at God today, the iPhone

748
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:13,800
Speaker 7:  in the

749
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,160
Speaker 9:  Middle of

750
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:18,440
Speaker 8:  Can you trust your kids with another phone and

751
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,200
Speaker 7:  An iPhone. The next Apple commercial is 10 book being like if you want to

752
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,080
Speaker 7:  stir death in the face, I

753
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:30,640
Speaker 7:  That's good. It's a very goth year for Apple. The

754
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,880
Speaker 7:  HomePod comes in black first

755
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:38,120
Speaker 7:  Anyway. The, that's, that's satellite. Whatever. I just wanna come

756
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,760
Speaker 7:  back to the camera for one second. It seems like we are at this place where

757
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,360
Speaker 7:  the mainstream is beginning to realize the cameras are really processed

758
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,840
Speaker 7:  and the photos look weird. And maybe the tech industry

759
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,800
Speaker 7:  particularly Samsung was like what people love is

760
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,680
Speaker 7:  insane colors and no contrast.

761
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:00,280
Speaker 7:  And like soon Gen Z will just be like, this is what photos look

762
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:04,160
Speaker 7:  like. And the answer is everyone realizes that that looks a

763
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,080
Speaker 7:  little too wild and it has not become sort of a default look. Are they

764
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,000
Speaker 7:  backing off yet?

765
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:13,240
Speaker 9:  I, I really haven't seen, I think it's just, they're sort of like doing like

766
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:17,080
Speaker 9:  Apple where they just pile on options. They're like okay here's

767
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,360
Speaker 9:  our version. You don't like that Fine. You can use

768
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,280
Speaker 9:  cool contrast or whatever. They're all called and

769
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:28,360
Speaker 9:  yeah I'm sure there's some setting and some camera

770
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,960
Speaker 9:  assistant menu on the Samsung that will be like make the

771
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,760
Speaker 9:  blue sky like a little less neon blue next

772
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,680
Speaker 9:  time. But it's, yeah, it's sort of on like us to

773
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,240
Speaker 9:  figure that out and I would kind of like, could you maybe

774
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:47,720
Speaker 9:  do something so like I take a picture of a sunset, it doesn't

775
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,120
Speaker 9:  suddenly look like violent purple.

776
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,640
Speaker 9:  Like that's my basic ask.

777
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:57,800
Speaker 7:  Yeah. There's just something going on here with these phones where it's the,

778
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:02,120
Speaker 7:  like they've learned just as the TV manufacturers and Best Buy have learned

779
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,880
Speaker 7:  like really bright things win or like Pepsi learned in the

780
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,880
Speaker 7:  eighties, Pepsi will always win the Pepsi challenge at the theme park cuz

781
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,280
Speaker 7:  as more sugar in it. But then you live with it, you're like, my TV looks

782
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,240
Speaker 7:  bonkers. Like this is too sweet. And then I think people

783
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,480
Speaker 7:  now with their phones are like, these photos don't look good. Like I don't

784
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,880
Speaker 7:  love every photo that's coming off of this phone because they're all, they're

785
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,640
Speaker 7:  all so noticeably overprocessed or far from

786
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,480
Speaker 7:  reality and it, it just doesn't seem like either one of these companies is

787
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,360
Speaker 7:  willing to blink yet. Like apple's getting closer to Samsung and

788
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,960
Speaker 7:  we've talked about that so many times and every, every year we're like, the

789
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,600
Speaker 7:  phones are getting closer together and in good light they're kind of indistinguishable.

790
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,240
Speaker 7:  But that target of indistinguishable photo is getting weirder and

791
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:45,680
Speaker 7:  weirder.

792
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:50,000
Speaker 9:  Yeah. I just still, I take pictures of people with an iPhone in

793
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,800
Speaker 9:  their orange and I'm like, why are we still having this

794
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,800
Speaker 9:  problem? Yeah. I don't know any orange people.

795
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:01,800
Speaker 7:  Well I'm just wondering cuz once you have a 200 megapixel sensor,

796
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:05,640
Speaker 7:  it, I mean the phone's huge but it's still small. Right? And you've got

797
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:09,760
Speaker 7:  full well capacity that's still teeny tiny. In order to get any

798
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,280
Speaker 7:  image off of that, like we're well beyond what is a photo and into

799
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:17,840
Speaker 7:  you might as well type in make a photo of a sunset and let

800
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,520
Speaker 7:  like the phone like chat G b t generate the answer for you.

801
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,680
Speaker 7:  Right. Like you're so far away from we're gonna

802
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,880
Speaker 7:  open the shutter and close it and show you a reflection of reality. You're

803
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,720
Speaker 7:  fully, there's a computer at the level of even just gathering the light.

804
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:37,480
Speaker 9:  Yeah, yeah. Just the, the basic mechanics of like

805
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:41,560
Speaker 9:  photography and making a photo are just like so far behind

806
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:41,800
Speaker 9:  us.

807
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:47,600
Speaker 9:  We are well into the future of neon sunsets

808
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,560
Speaker 9:  and I don't, I don't see it like coming down anytime soon. Like

809
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:55,000
Speaker 7:  No, my prediction is the next, the Galaxy S 24,

810
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:59,000
Speaker 7:  instead of how many lenses this time in the back 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

811
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:03,480
Speaker 7:  it will have zero and it will just be like a mid journey prompt

812
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,120
Speaker 7:  that's like I'm,

813
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,280
Speaker 1:  That's what Microsoft and Samsung are working on with their mixed reality.

814
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,440
Speaker 1:  It's chatt being the camera.

815
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:12,160
Speaker 7:  Just like you tell Bicks be like make a photo of my mother.

816
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:16,200
Speaker 9:  Yeah. In front of the Grand Canyon. She's

817
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,160
Speaker 7:  Like generate that for you. Zero lens cameras. You heard it here on

818
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,920
Speaker 7:  the road fast first, it's gonna be great.

819
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:24,520
Speaker 9:  I'm looking forward to it.

820
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,200
Speaker 7:  What's going on with the S 23 plus and the regular S 23?

821
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:30,360
Speaker 9:  So those were even less interesting

822
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,880
Speaker 9:  honestly they, they, they really got just little

823
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,040
Speaker 9:  incremental upgrades. They got the new four Galaxy

824
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:42,120
Speaker 9:  Snapdragon gen two processor. They, I

825
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,360
Speaker 9:  think maybe the most meaningful thing is that they got slightly bigger batteries.

826
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:49,200
Speaker 9:  The S 23 is to like relatively small. It's 30

827
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,880
Speaker 9:  900 million hours and then S 23 plus is

828
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,640
Speaker 9:  4,700 in the battery life in the S 22

829
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,520
Speaker 9:  phones I think was like not great. It wasn't, it wasn't

830
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:04,400
Speaker 9:  like deal breaking bad but you just kind of like, you start to

831
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,120
Speaker 9:  get the, like your palms get kind of clammy by the end of the day when you're

832
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,960
Speaker 9:  like, oh I'm at 20% or whatever. So I think a little

833
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:15,680
Speaker 9:  battery boost could actually be a big, a good thing here.

834
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,720
Speaker 9:  And that's kinda it. They got the new gorilla glass, the S

835
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,560
Speaker 9:  23 plus got the base model storage upgrade. But

836
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:27,520
Speaker 9:  the S 23 didn't, no, no change in price,

837
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,240
Speaker 9:  which is good news. I think it's squares

838
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:35,080
Speaker 9:  still. I don't think those ones are, no they, they

839
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:39,200
Speaker 9:  had like straighter edges to start with. They already kind of

840
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,800
Speaker 9:  looked like iPhones from 2016, which I secretly

841
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,040
Speaker 9:  really love. So they were already on the right side of

842
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:47,000
Speaker 9:  history there.

843
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,320
Speaker 7:  We're gonna talk about earnings for a bunch of companies a minute here. Apple

844
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:55,200
Speaker 7:  just posted their earnings. Google posted its earnings. Samsung is in the

845
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,560
Speaker 7:  same spot with these phones as they are in with laptops and sort of everybody's

846
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:02,040
Speaker 7:  in, which is everybody bought their upgrade in the pandemic

847
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:06,320
Speaker 7:  and now they're like, I don't need another phone or laptop. And I think

848
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:09,920
Speaker 7:  particularly for these mid-range phones, like I thought the iPhone 14

849
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,800
Speaker 7:  plus would be a huge seller cuz a big cheap screen and it's like

850
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:17,160
Speaker 7:  fine. You know like the thing that's selling is the really high end and the

851
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,320
Speaker 7:  sort of midrange everybody is already upgraded through. Yeah. Do do these

852
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,720
Speaker 7:  S 20 threes, are they just kind of like, well we gotta have something or

853
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,800
Speaker 7:  are they like actually trying to get people to upgrade?

854
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:30,040
Speaker 9:  Yeah, I think these are just, this is just the, the current phone

855
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:34,120
Speaker 9:  on the shelf with the like new for 2023. That's

856
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:34,600
Speaker 7:  This one.

857
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:38,680
Speaker 9:  Yeah. It's like, is it your year to upgrade? Here you

858
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:42,360
Speaker 9:  go. You know, you don't want last year's model. You want the

859
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:46,240
Speaker 9:  brand shiny new one. I think like the

860
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,880
Speaker 9:  whole whole kind of launch event and all the like

861
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:54,080
Speaker 9:  pizzazz and whatever is is more about like kind

862
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:57,760
Speaker 9:  of convincing you you're in the right ecosystem. Yeah. More than like, oh

863
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,280
Speaker 9:  I gotta run out and go get this S 23 Ultra cuz 200

864
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,760
Speaker 9:  megapixels. It's sort of like, you know when your time comes around you're

865
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,720
Speaker 9:  like, I'm gonna upgrade this here. Kind of remember you're like, yeah, see

866
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:09,240
Speaker 9:  that

867
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,160
Speaker 1:  Kind of tracks with the laptop stuff too because so much of their pitch was

868
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,920
Speaker 1:  like, hey remember you can do this stuff with the Galaxy phone. Yeah.

869
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,000
Speaker 1:  Just FYI guys, we've had this for a while.

870
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:21,560
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I mean Apple, apple does that too, right? They like, here's a new version

871
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,960
Speaker 7:  of Mac Os and then let launch the laptops and like 90% of it is like Mac

872
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,280
Speaker 7:  os features from WW C fine. I'm just saying like,

873
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:31,480
Speaker 7:  it's great they had an event, it's great. Everyone's back together. Like

874
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,440
Speaker 7:  we're back in it. Samsung next year will have Broadway answers once again,

875
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,320
Speaker 7:  I'm sure. But it's just a weird spot, right? Where

876
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:43,280
Speaker 7:  everything is very incremental and the market is

877
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,080
Speaker 7:  very much saying we don't need new stuff. So it's not, I I just like,

878
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,930
Speaker 7:  I'm looking at these phones. They're great, they're fun. The edges

879
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:54,890
Speaker 7:  are more square. The chip is for Galaxy now. I mean

880
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:55,450
Speaker 7:  that's huge.

881
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:56,930
Speaker 1:  Oh yeah. No

882
00:47:56,930 --> 00:47:57,010
Speaker 7:  One,

883
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:58,010
Speaker 1:  No one else can have that

884
00:47:58,010 --> 00:47:59,610
Speaker 7:  Chip. That's all anybody's been talking to us.

885
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:01,530
Speaker 1:  Apple go

886
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:05,370
Speaker 7:  Away. No one else can have a stab Dragon chip. I get it. But it, it just

887
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:09,210
Speaker 7:  seems like they're launching into sort of market that's

888
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:13,170
Speaker 7:  kind of bored or, or has already done. It's like upgrades. Yeah. And on top

889
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:16,930
Speaker 7:  of that, the 5G upgrade cycle is it is the thing,

890
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,930
Speaker 7:  I mean, you know, y'all know how I feel about that. That's what chat G B

891
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:22,770
Speaker 7:  T would really be like is like the robot, like 5G is bullshit. Like,

892
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:29,090
Speaker 7:  but like it's it's just sort of like happening. It's a default. It's not

893
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:32,930
Speaker 7:  a reason to upgrade. It hasn't pulled anyone forward. Is that just like,

894
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,770
Speaker 7:  that's is my vibe is like Samsung had to announce a bunch of stuff. There

895
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:40,690
Speaker 7:  are some new chips, there's some new camera capabilities and like here,

896
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:43,730
Speaker 7:  here it's, and I I think Apple's like in the same place too. I mean we Chip

897
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:45,650
Speaker 7:  bumped MacBooks is the same deal. Right?

898
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,850
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I mean I think it was interesting talking to people at

899
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:53,130
Speaker 1:  CES because I did get a sense that a lot of them were,

900
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,730
Speaker 1:  were sort of like, yeah we're trying to figure out how to keep the PC exciting

901
00:48:57,190 --> 00:49:01,010
Speaker 1:  and target, you know, convince the high end that these PCs

902
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:04,170
Speaker 1:  can do things that they couldn't do before. And like a lot of what they were

903
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:07,090
Speaker 1:  pushing was webcam features. That was like a big thing. They're like, well

904
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:08,370
Speaker 1:  Richard, Richard,

905
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:12,130
Speaker 7:  You won't do it. Not yet. These are my real eyes.

906
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:16,010
Speaker 1:  Web gaming is like, oh you're, you know, you're conferencing a lot now you

907
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:19,690
Speaker 1:  need this. There was a lot of push on the gaming

908
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,930
Speaker 1:  side and people saying like, your game, these new games that are coming out,

909
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:26,770
Speaker 1:  you can play them now with all this, this these, this new gaming laptop and

910
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:30,730
Speaker 1:  Samsung didn't is has not been a huge

911
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:34,610
Speaker 1:  player in either of those spaces with its previous Galaxy Books. And so

912
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:38,250
Speaker 1:  it seems to me like the book Ultra is maybe the closest thing they have to

913
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:41,970
Speaker 1:  something that could appeal to the gaming demographic. They, the way they

914
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:44,890
Speaker 1:  said it to me at the event was like, you know, you could game on this. Is

915
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:47,490
Speaker 1:  it for gamers? No, but you could game on this was sort of like their, their

916
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:51,410
Speaker 1:  vibe, which you know is fair. Is it sort of the Apple thing too at this point.

917
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:55,290
Speaker 1:  So I think that they are coming that that's I think the,

918
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:59,130
Speaker 1:  the most exciting one of these and the one that I can see people

919
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:02,090
Speaker 1:  upgrading to. Especially if they have a Galaxy book that doesn't play games

920
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:04,570
Speaker 1:  really well. Like that could be a reasonable sell for them.

921
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:05,770
Speaker 7:  All right, we'll

922
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:06,610
Speaker 1:  See. But you know, we'll see

923
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,370
Speaker 7:  That's the news from unpacked, right? And there was, that's it. Yeah.

924
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:15,090
Speaker 7:  I mean it's again, I don't wanna like end on a down note, which

925
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:18,930
Speaker 7:  I've been told not to do over and over again. We have to wait for new

926
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:22,770
Speaker 7:  foldables. We yeah, we gotta wait for new foldables. They got some new screen

927
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:26,610
Speaker 7:  text. We're not ready. Yeah, but it's like these are this your Samsung rectangles

928
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:27,120
Speaker 7:  are here, here

929
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:32,640
Speaker 7:  Bpe like how many times was Bixie mentioned? Did they mention it all? Oh

930
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,440
Speaker 9:  My gosh man, I don't, I don't think I heard Bix. They

931
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,720
Speaker 9:  must have said Bixby like once at least

932
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:41,920
Speaker 7:  We gotta didn't hear it. Gotta do We, we did our usual super cut. We gotta

933
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,400
Speaker 7:  start doing Bixby. Supercuts. She's like Bixby count one person be like,

934
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,440
Speaker 7:  and it's not Bixby me,

935
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:54,040
Speaker 7:  but that layer, that service layer, they're trying to build. They keep mentioning

936
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:58,000
Speaker 7:  it but it hasn't like gone anywhere else. Yeah, okay. I mean

937
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,680
Speaker 7:  look, apple needs a competitor. They're the leader of the market. Google's

938
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,760
Speaker 7:  like, we sold more pixels than ever before and it's still like seven.

939
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:07,640
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I mean the continuity stuff, I think the continuity stuff is cool.

940
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:11,320
Speaker 1:  It works. Isn't as smooth as Apple's continuity stuff I think.

941
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:14,440
Speaker 1:  No, I know you said before like, oh people don't switch. Like I switched

942
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,680
Speaker 1:  like I, I switched from Windows to Apple not too long ago. Oh no, I think,

943
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,040
Speaker 1:  I think that we are at a point where

944
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,600
Speaker 7:  That's another full hour page.

945
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,640
Speaker 1:  That's another full fantastic.

946
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:22,800
Speaker 7:  It's like next

947
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,520
Speaker 1:  Week for the full story for, for my journey.

948
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:30,560
Speaker 1:  I think there are, this is the first year that I know some really

949
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,840
Speaker 1:  hardcore windows people who are starting to say to me like, should I look

950
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:37,360
Speaker 1:  at these Macs? And I like I in many, many years in this career, I've never,

951
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,560
Speaker 1:  I basically have never heard that before. And I think if I were same thing,

952
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:44,320
Speaker 1:  I'd really be trying to pull out the shoe lights is here and put out a competitor.

953
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:48,240
Speaker 1:  Cuz I do think, you know, if only tot stem the tide of people leaving

954
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:48,800
Speaker 1:  to Apple. If

955
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,680
Speaker 7:  Not because of the price performance in the process. Yeah. All right, we'll

956
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,400
Speaker 7:  see we gotta take a break. We, there is earnings, like literally as we've

957
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,720
Speaker 7:  been speaking, apple earnings broke, there's alphabet earnings. There's just,

958
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:01,840
Speaker 7:  we gotta talk about some money. We'll be back in a second. We'll go through

00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:33,020
Speaker 7:  We're back. It's time to talk earnings. You know, like I spend

997
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,420
Speaker 7:  a lot of time on CNBC and I'm still bad at this. I just wanna be clear

998
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:41,740
Speaker 8:  Just talking about money man, it's this little unimportant thing.

999
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:41,980
Speaker 8:  Well

1000
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:45,300
Speaker 7:  You know I have this theory and I've thought about this a lot covering

1001
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:49,420
Speaker 7:  tech, especially for a site like ours that has a, like a inherent

1002
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:53,380
Speaker 7:  built-in like big reviews program is the weirdest part

1003
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:57,180
Speaker 7:  of the media. Like there are very few other parts of the media

1004
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,980
Speaker 7:  where you're like, we're gonna cover the people, we're gonna cover the events,

1005
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:04,060
Speaker 7:  we're gonna look at the thing, we're gonna make jokes about bpe and then

1006
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:07,140
Speaker 7:  we're gonna take your product and we're gonna look at it and Allison's gonna

1007
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,100
Speaker 7:  be like seven

1008
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:13,500
Speaker 7:  just like never happens. Like it doesn't happen in like in politics

1009
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:17,380
Speaker 7:  the voters vote, right? But that's not you doing it in sports. The teams

1010
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:20,900
Speaker 7:  play and there's a winner and a loser, but you didn't like sports writers

1011
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,540
Speaker 7:  are not like out there being like you're gonna win. And we are very much

1012
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:28,180
Speaker 7:  like you lost HomePod. Good. Try,

1013
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:31,980
Speaker 7:  try again. Right? The only thing that up, the only external thing that

1014
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,700
Speaker 7:  happens is earnings where the companies tell you if like they made money

1015
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:35,020
Speaker 7:  or not.

1016
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:38,180
Speaker 9:  It's a whole different language to learn the

1017
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:42,420
Speaker 9:  EBITDA and the runway and yeah it's, it's

1018
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:46,100
Speaker 9:  like being thrown into a different world with different people who

1019
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:47,900
Speaker 9:  say different things.

1020
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,900
Speaker 7:  Yes. And care very little about like you cannot tell, I cannot go on

1021
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,780
Speaker 7:  CBC and be like, it's got a 200 megapixel camera. They'll be like who cares?

1022
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:57,420
Speaker 9:  They're not gonna hear about the full well capacity.

1023
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,740
Speaker 7:  The next time I go on tv I'm definitely gonna be like full well capacity.

1024
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:05,620
Speaker 7:  Just throw it out there in like zero context and see what happens. Oh

1025
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:06,460
Speaker 9:  My gosh, do it.

1026
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,740
Speaker 8:  The actual US usability, what what people actually think does not matter.

1027
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:13,940
Speaker 8:  How did it do financially? Right? And how do they project that it will do

1028
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:17,780
Speaker 8:  financially next quarter compared to last year? Last year

1029
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:19,060
Speaker 8:  over year. Yeah. Same quarter.

1030
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:22,420
Speaker 7:  I'm saying this is the weirdest, this is the weirdest little intersection

1031
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:26,210
Speaker 7:  of covering tech. Cause nothing else has this part where

1032
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:30,570
Speaker 7:  the journalists evaluate the end result. We're like Google, we covered everything

1033
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:33,370
Speaker 7:  that you did and it's a four. You know like it's just like,

1034
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:38,410
Speaker 7:  and then there's this other part of, of the business anyhow, I just wanna

1035
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:41,490
Speaker 7:  point out, it's weird, we talk about it a lot but it's, it's because it's

1036
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:45,250
Speaker 7:  these earnings every quarter are the moment where the company

1037
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:48,730
Speaker 7:  tells you, the public companies tell you how they did. Right. Did people

1038
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:52,650
Speaker 7:  like our phones? And the answer, we'll start with Apple. The answer is

1039
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:56,290
Speaker 7:  people like the phones but they can't make any so they didn't make as much

1040
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:58,410
Speaker 7:  money as they usually do. Is that about right Richard?

1041
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:02,940
Speaker 8:  Yeah. So they reported their earnings for a Q1 2023

1042
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,860
Speaker 8:  they took in 117, which

1043
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:08,140
Speaker 7:  Is the holiday quarter. Apples quarters are yes. Are

1044
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:11,780
Speaker 7:  scooted over one. So Q1 23 is really

1045
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,220
Speaker 7:  December quarter 22.

1046
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:16,860
Speaker 8:  That's the other thing about about it. You have to learn a whole new calendar

1047
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,860
Speaker 8:  that isn't your regular calendar and not all the companies use the same calendar.

1048
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:22,460
Speaker 8:  So you're gonna be saying weird things all the time. Yeah. People will look

1049
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:25,420
Speaker 8:  at you like you are insane because you're like, oh yeah it's q4,

1050
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:26,220
Speaker 7:  Is it?

1051
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:30,860
Speaker 8:  Maybe. Anyhow. But yes, there's been wait times for the

1052
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:34,540
Speaker 8:  iPhone for, for the high end iPhone 14 models they make the most money on.

1053
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:38,580
Speaker 8:  They've had these supply issues, they are kind of reshuffling

1054
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:42,020
Speaker 8:  their supply chain to rely less on China. They've been so many issues in

1055
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:45,340
Speaker 8:  China with C O V D and other issues with labor.

1056
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:48,660
Speaker 8:  Everything in that that is all kind of combined to affect

1057
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:53,020
Speaker 8:  the the profit of one, you know, one of the most profitable

1058
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:56,420
Speaker 8:  companies over the, or perhaps the most profitable company over the last

1059
00:57:56,420 --> 00:58:00,340
Speaker 8:  few years. Also they have a problem where the last generation of, when you

1060
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:03,980
Speaker 8:  look at their laptops, the M one laptops were so, were such an incredible

1061
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:07,860
Speaker 8:  upgrade over what had been out there. Two a little bit better but it's

1062
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:08,540
Speaker 8:  just a little bit better.

1063
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:12,860
Speaker 7:  So Apple did predict that Max sales would decline substantially compared

1064
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:16,820
Speaker 7:  to a year ago. They were correct in this prediction. Max sales are down

1065
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:20,780
Speaker 7:  29% and I think that all feeds into it like the M one MacBook error.

1066
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:24,620
Speaker 7:  Like we were like throw your laptop out the window and buy this thing. And

1067
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:28,380
Speaker 7:  then combined with the pandemic it was the thing to buy. And

1068
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:32,100
Speaker 7:  that's a no one is, unless you are very picky about webcams,

1069
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:35,620
Speaker 7:  which I am and that webcam is garbage.

1070
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:41,020
Speaker 7:  There's no reason to buy a new MacBook Air. And I think most people are

1071
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:43,820
Speaker 7:  not that picky about webcams. So you can see apples just like running like

1072
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:47,260
Speaker 7:  this is a company that makes most of its money on the iPhone is having really

1073
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:50,620
Speaker 7:  hard times making enough iPhones to sell,

1074
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:54,690
Speaker 7:  which might mask the fact that people don't want those lower

1075
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,850
Speaker 7:  mid-tier iPhones. Allison. Like they want the pros

1076
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:02,130
Speaker 7:  and maybe all the demand for upgrades in the, in the mid-tier is

1077
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:05,770
Speaker 7:  satiated by pandemic upgrades. Upgrade cycles are getting longer

1078
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:10,090
Speaker 7:  so they can't make enough of the high-end stuff and then the all the Mac

1079
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:13,570
Speaker 7:  upgrades are done for now. So they're kind of stuck with services, right?

1080
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:15,530
Speaker 7:  Seems like it. They

1081
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:18,930
Speaker 8:  Are and that's why we suddenly have Apple TV plus we have they, them bundling

1082
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:21,920
Speaker 8:  all their services together says you can get your iCloud and your Apple TV

1083
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,600
Speaker 8:  and your news and everything else because the people who buy those highest

1084
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,320
Speaker 8:  end devices, the people who get the most expensive subscriptions or get the

1085
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:31,800
Speaker 8:  package, they just wanna find another way to get something from you because

1086
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,920
Speaker 8:  that's the way that they can demonstrate revenue growth to their investors.

1087
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:37,080
Speaker 8:  So other than of course launching a car

1088
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,000
Speaker 7:  Or this headset, so services revenue for Apple up 6%,

1089
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:46,040
Speaker 7:  they now have more than 2 billion active devices running the services.

1090
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:50,320
Speaker 7:  I'm sure this means an iCloud storage upgrade. Push

1091
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,960
Speaker 7:  notification is about to hit all 2 billion of those devices.

1092
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:57,960
Speaker 7:  Did you know that Apple has games in Apple arcade? 2 billion beeps

1093
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:01,920
Speaker 7:  all at the same time around the world, right? Tim cook's like we made some

1094
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,160
Speaker 7:  money. The one that surprised me, well two that surprised me in combination

1095
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:08,200
Speaker 7:  wearables, which has Apple Watch and AirPods down

1096
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:12,640
Speaker 7:  which tracks, cuz I think most of those things get bought along with an

1097
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:16,280
Speaker 7:  iPhone. So I think there's some, well AirPods people lose,

1098
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:20,440
Speaker 7:  but I think the vast majority of AirPods get bought with your iPhone. The

1099
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,480
Speaker 7:  vast majority of Apple watches get bought around an iPhone. So if iPhone

1100
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:26,880
Speaker 7:  sells, again, let's go down iPad revenue up

1101
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,800
Speaker 7:  30%. Even though the iPad line, from what I can tell

1102
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:34,760
Speaker 7:  is more confusing than it has ever been before. But maybe that's

1103
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,600
Speaker 7:  it. People are just like going to the store and they're freaked out. They're

1104
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:40,640
Speaker 7:  surrounded by a wall of iPads, you know, like, I gotta watch, I have to have

1105
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,520
Speaker 7:  one. All there's gotta one for for whatever. So all in all,

1106
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:47,000
Speaker 8:  I feel like you're at a point in the cycle where, where people are upgrading

1107
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,440
Speaker 8:  iPads. It's like, like I bought a new iPad last year. All right. There's

1108
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:53,520
Speaker 8:  gotta be somebody who's like, oh, okay, you know that that old one is just

1109
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,320
Speaker 8:  not cutting it anymore.

1110
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:58,160
Speaker 7:  Yeah. All in all, all this adds up to the iPhone is down, the Mac

1111
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:02,000
Speaker 7:  is down, that means apples down, right? Apples year over year 5% down in

1112
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,360
Speaker 7:  the holiday quarter. That's a big deal. That's one of those like wow. Usually

1113
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,200
Speaker 7:  Apple sluts records in this quarter and I think they're, they're hurting

1114
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,920
Speaker 7:  because of the covid stuff in China in particular. So that's Apple.

1115
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,800
Speaker 8:  And as as you mentioned, Samsung and Apple and everyone is kind of having

1116
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:17,640
Speaker 8:  these same things and Samsung had just a, after a string of record breaking

1117
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,600
Speaker 8:  quarters had like their worst quarter in eight years. Yeah. And that's just

1118
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:21,800
Speaker 8:  where we are now. Liz,

1119
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,240
Speaker 7:  We're wrote that great piece last week about all the companies doing layoffs

1120
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:28,960
Speaker 7:  and tech. I, I don't know if we have a lot of like MBA students or MBA

1121
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,280
Speaker 7:  professors out there. There's a paper or a book to be written

1122
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:36,600
Speaker 7:  about the single greatest business mistake in our generation,

1123
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:39,840
Speaker 7:  which is everyone thought the things that happened in the pandemic would

1124
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:43,720
Speaker 7:  happen forever. They're like, everyone will buy a new laptop

1125
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:47,280
Speaker 7:  every year to work at home. We should make thousands of. And it's like, no

1126
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,320
Speaker 7:  dude, they're gonna buy one and then they're gonna go back outside. Like

1127
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:53,800
Speaker 7:  the entire business community was like, what if these motherfuckers never

1128
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,880
Speaker 7:  go outside again? And like here we're,

1129
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:57,080
Speaker 8:  We got 'em.

1130
01:01:57,670 --> 01:02:00,520
Speaker 7:  It's like, no, like Barks stock was like, here's what they're gonna do. They're

1131
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,880
Speaker 7:  gonna stay inside all day and they're gonna be brains and vats and I'm gonna

1132
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,240
Speaker 7:  build the metaverse for the vat brain people. And it's like, I don't,

1133
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:08,720
Speaker 7:  I could have told you what was gonna happen to

1134
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:13,120
Speaker 8:  No, they they would rather go to concerts in person.

1135
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:17,080
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It turns out Fortnite concerts were only interesting when you

1136
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,480
Speaker 7:  were not allowed to leave your house.

1137
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,280
Speaker 9:  Right. We have options now.

1138
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:25,240
Speaker 7:  Yeah, it's pretty good. A little better just, just touching grass alone.

1139
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:26,680
Speaker 7:  Not in Fortnite is great.

1140
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:30,880
Speaker 8:  And so Apple's launching pay later as, as Tim

1141
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,880
Speaker 8:  Cook said on c CBC said it's coming. So this

1142
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,920
Speaker 7:  Is very late. They announced this a while ago, but they, they, it's still

1143
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,880
Speaker 8:  Out. They're getting big into financial services. Apple is not a bank yet,

1144
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:43,960
Speaker 8:  but they're getting closer. You know, they're gonna let you earn interest

1145
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:47,840
Speaker 8:  on, on your, your balance and suddenly this is a very important thing for

1146
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:50,600
Speaker 8:  them. Like this is, this is, as I said, we're talking about the money here.

1147
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,480
Speaker 8:  This is what Tim Cook's whole compensation is based on. What can he

1148
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,680
Speaker 8:  do to grow Apple? They're trying to find something and, and I don't, well

1149
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:01,440
Speaker 7:  There's only three categories, right? Like there there's only three

1150
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:05,320
Speaker 7:  categories that are big enough to move the needle for Apple it's healthcare

1151
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:09,600
Speaker 7:  cars and the banks. Like you can't, I'm like,

1152
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,480
Speaker 7:  apple should make a TV and you look at the entire TV industry, if Apples

1153
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,960
Speaker 7:  took a hundred percent market share of the TV industry, they'd be like, that

1154
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,520
Speaker 7:  wasn't enough. That wasn't enough percentage growth. And like

1155
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:22,720
Speaker 7:  this is, this is like a champagne problem. Like Tim Cook cries about this

1156
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:26,320
Speaker 7:  problem while breaking open a magnum of champagne on his yacht. He's like,

1157
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:30,040
Speaker 7:  how do I move the needle? I don't know, bring me another magnum of champagne.

1158
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:34,600
Speaker 7:  Like right. But this is their problem to move the needle. They have to

1159
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:37,880
Speaker 7:  go play in the biggest remaining industries, which is why they're chasing

1160
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:41,840
Speaker 7:  cars, which is why they think they're doctors and now it's

1161
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:42,640
Speaker 7:  why they think they're a bank.

1162
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:44,880
Speaker 9:  Kind of terrifying.

1163
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:48,720
Speaker 7:  It is smaller. Speaking of other gigantic terrifying companies, let's talk

1164
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:52,480
Speaker 7:  about Google. They also had, they had like a

1165
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:56,160
Speaker 7:  flat earnings quarter and it's partially because of the advertising slowdown,

1166
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:00,080
Speaker 7:  partially cuz of Apple, but partially cuz they, they're now having to like

1167
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:03,880
Speaker 7:  spend money to invent new things, which Google has not,

1168
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:06,000
Speaker 7:  I would say had a great track record of doing.

1169
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:09,960
Speaker 8:  You, you may have heard they, their new products don't always, always turn

1170
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:13,040
Speaker 8:  into something or, or they launch something and then a couple of years later

1171
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,080
Speaker 8:  they're killing it. I'm not talking about Stadia, but I could

1172
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:15,200
Speaker 7:  Be.

1173
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:20,120
Speaker 8:  But yeah, when you're talking about advertising revenue, they said down

1174
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:23,880
Speaker 8:  2 billion. So yeah, that's a pretty significant hit. And

1175
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,960
Speaker 8:  somehow Google will have to get by after they, their profits for the quarter

1176
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:30,800
Speaker 8:  were only 13.6 billion, which I would think is

1177
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:34,400
Speaker 8:  pretty good. But because they made 20.6 billion the year before, they're,

1178
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,440
Speaker 8:  they're not so happy with. Yeah.

1179
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,280
Speaker 7:  Google also just had layoffs. Apple's the only big tech company that has

1180
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:41,920
Speaker 7:  not had layoffs recently. Google obviously just had its first mass

1181
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,240
Speaker 7:  layoffs in its history. Amazon just had layoffs. Microsoft had layoffs, meta

1182
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,960
Speaker 7:  had layoffs. We'll get to that in a second. It sounds like Zuckerberg wants

1183
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:51,640
Speaker 7:  to have more layoffs cause he just keeps paddling on about efficiency,

1184
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:54,520
Speaker 7:  which is, I know what that means. Y'all know what that means.

1185
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:59,560
Speaker 7:  But Google like, you know, Google is an advertising company. Like fundamentally

1186
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:03,320
Speaker 7:  that's how Google makes money is advertising on the web. They've, we, I've

1187
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,800
Speaker 7:  been hammering on this for the past couple weeks. Google's in the hardest

1188
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:09,480
Speaker 7:  spot I think it's ever been in as a company, right? The DOJ is coming after

1189
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:13,440
Speaker 7:  the ad stuff chat g PT is coming after Google's

1190
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,960
Speaker 7:  search results on in both directions. You can ask chat g for answers.

1191
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:20,560
Speaker 7:  And then Shady SEO farms are just making chat g b t

1192
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:24,320
Speaker 7:  webpages to ruin Google search results. So the product is getting squeezed

1193
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,840
Speaker 7:  on both sides. Apples ad tracking transparency stuff not

1194
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,760
Speaker 7:  great for Google, right? It's, it's ruining its ability to, to

1195
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:35,200
Speaker 7:  track users across the web and deliver personalized advertising. The, it

1196
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,880
Speaker 7:  just feels like the hardest spot Google's ever been in. And that

1197
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:42,840
Speaker 7:  I would not say that these earnings showcase any glimmer of the

1198
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:43,080
Speaker 7:  future.

1199
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:46,680
Speaker 8:  No. And the, and the new things they've been developing aren't really filling

1200
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:50,480
Speaker 8:  the gap. You look at the cloud, not not doing it YouTube, not doing

1201
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:54,360
Speaker 8:  it pixel hardware. I mean look, we're, we're trying but it's,

1202
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:57,320
Speaker 8:  it's just not doing it. The, the Pixel watch is unfortunately not making

1203
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,160
Speaker 8:  a dent in that 2 billion.

1204
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:02,080
Speaker 7:  Wouldn't it be incredible if pixel hardware just like saved, saved Google

1205
01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:05,120
Speaker 7:  like tomorrow the pixels like, all right, that's the end, that's the new

1206
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:09,080
Speaker 7:  iPhone gonna run the company. We did it. So just

1207
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:12,480
Speaker 7:  to be specific, lots of Google's main revenue drivers are down

1208
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:16,520
Speaker 7:  over the past year advertising down by 2 billion as Richard said services,

1209
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:20,560
Speaker 7:  which includes Android chrome hardware, which is a bonkers thing to

1210
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:24,400
Speaker 7:  put in services. That's how important hardware is to

1211
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:24,640
Speaker 7:  Google.

1212
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:26,680
Speaker 9:  They just threw it in there. Yeah,

1213
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:30,400
Speaker 7:  Just lump it in with Chrome. But services includes Android, chrome hardware,

1214
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,880
Speaker 7:  Google Maps, Google Play search and YouTube down by 1.5 billion.

1215
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:37,640
Speaker 7:  And then it also spent more than a 1.5 billion

1216
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:41,160
Speaker 7:  on r and d. So you just see Google, Google's in this place where it has to

1217
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:44,720
Speaker 7:  invent something new cuz the things that make a lot of money are going down.

1218
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:48,200
Speaker 7:  And then on top of that YouTube, which is a bit of a bright spot, they just

1219
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:51,760
Speaker 7:  roll that monetization for YouTube shorts like yesterday. So if this thing

1220
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:55,200
Speaker 7:  is gonna become the next generation of the YouTube creator economy, which

1221
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:59,080
Speaker 7:  TikTok does not have, which Instagram does not have, so if they can actually

1222
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:03,040
Speaker 7:  get the payment split to creators right on shorts, you might

1223
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:06,800
Speaker 7:  see more creators going to YouTube. But that's still pretty insignificant

1224
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:10,240
Speaker 7:  and a long way out. Like that's a pretty tough combination of things for

1225
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:10,520
Speaker 7:  YouTube.

1226
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:13,880
Speaker 8:  I think the executives are walking around asking if anyone has a $7 billion

1227
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:17,480
Speaker 8:  idea for the next quarter. We've got Sergey Brynn putting in poll requests

1228
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:21,280
Speaker 8:  I think for, for the first time in years. So just,

1229
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,480
Speaker 8:  just any, if anyone who's still there, if you, if you have a way to make

1230
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,200
Speaker 8:  7 billion, they're, they're certainly

1231
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:30,520
Speaker 9:  Interesting. Yeah, well maybe start with Google search and make

1232
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:34,400
Speaker 9:  it le a less miserable experience. I don't know like

1233
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:37,960
Speaker 9:  it's so bad now that I, I don't know, I

1234
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,800
Speaker 9:  need to read the article we're passing around but like

1235
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:45,840
Speaker 9:  it's so, there's so much junk you have to like wade through to

1236
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:49,320
Speaker 9:  get to whatever you were looking for. Just feels like it's

1237
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:53,240
Speaker 9:  something a product's been like piled on and piled on and just kind of

1238
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,200
Speaker 9:  forgotten about.

1239
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:57,040
Speaker 7:  Yeah, well cuz it's monopoly, it this it's a,

1240
01:07:57,630 --> 01:08:01,080
Speaker 8:  A bit of news that came in just as we were getting into the earnings. They've

1241
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:04,920
Speaker 8:  scheduled an event to show off some AI search stuff. We don't know if it's

1242
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:08,560
Speaker 8:  gonna be the chatbot, but February 8th, 8:30 AM Eastern Time

1243
01:08:08,590 --> 01:08:11,080
Speaker 8:  live from France AI search stuff.

1244
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:14,240
Speaker 7:  Oh that's great. All right. That's definitely not a panic scheduled event.

1245
01:08:16,410 --> 01:08:20,040
Speaker 7:  No, this is, this is rumors I think CNBC reported this week.

1246
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:24,000
Speaker 7:  Google has a version of the search landing page where it just tells

1247
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,840
Speaker 7:  you the answer and it has some suggested prompts of things you

1248
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:31,560
Speaker 7:  might ask. It's chap out for. Now to be perfectly

1249
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:35,160
Speaker 7:  clear, Google's claim, and this is

1250
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:39,320
Speaker 7:  what people in the industry believe to be true, is that Lambda, it's big

1251
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:43,200
Speaker 7:  l l m, it's competitor at chat. G p t is superior to chat

1252
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:47,040
Speaker 7:  G P t. That's the claim. That's what people have been saying. They

1253
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,440
Speaker 7:  won't release it because like every AI chatbot it will just

1254
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:54,240
Speaker 7:  confidently lie to you. So that's a real problem if

1255
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:58,120
Speaker 7:  you're Google. So we'll see how they deploy this thing. They obviously

1256
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:01,920
Speaker 7:  are very defensive about the fact that they invented a lot of this technology

1257
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:06,440
Speaker 7:  and they have had the scruples of not just releasing it. Whereas open eyes

1258
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:09,280
Speaker 7:  like, I don't know the robot's gonna lie to you, see what happens next.

1259
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:13,240
Speaker 7:  There's also a rumor that the Google version, the chat bot will be able to

1260
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:16,960
Speaker 7:  answer questions like current events, which is like, that's where the

1261
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,720
Speaker 7:  confident lining becomes a real problem, you know? So we'll see.

1262
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:24,160
Speaker 7:  I wanna keep talking about ours, I wanna talk about meta, but real quick

1263
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:28,040
Speaker 7:  on Microsoft. Microsoft is an, is just like high on

1264
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:31,840
Speaker 7:  life because it has this open AI investment. So they're just like starting

1265
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:35,720
Speaker 7:  to announce things. Teams Premium has features powered by

1266
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:39,640
Speaker 7:  open ai. So you can watch chat g PT talking teams for

1267
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:43,600
Speaker 7:  you. They're rolling out tech to write sales

1268
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,440
Speaker 7:  emails using chat G P T, which is like Microsoft is so

1269
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:51,160
Speaker 7:  excited about having the tiniest tread of a lead in AI

1270
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:55,280
Speaker 7:  and the first thing they thought about doing was like mail merge like the

1271
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:58,720
Speaker 7:  most Microsoft thing. I can't believe that they didn't bring Balmer back

1272
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:02,480
Speaker 7:  for that one. Yeah, cool. It's very good. And then there's this

1273
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:06,320
Speaker 7:  pretty lightly sourced rumor in SE four that the next version

1274
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:10,000
Speaker 7:  of Bing will have chat G P T in it powered by G PT four,

1275
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:14,040
Speaker 7:  which is a huge hype balloon. People think G PT four is gonna be like the

1276
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:16,880
Speaker 7:  best thing ever have, even like the C of an ai. Sam Altman is like, people

1277
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,760
Speaker 7:  are gonna be disappointed by chat GBT that's powered by G four because you've

1278
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:24,120
Speaker 7:  hyped it up so much you have no choice but to be disappointed. That said,

1279
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:27,920
Speaker 7:  a new version of Bing that as G PT four powered results

1280
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:32,280
Speaker 7:  is a threat to Google just from Mindshare alone, right? Just

1281
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:35,600
Speaker 7:  from seeming like the cutting edge alone. And I think that's why Google is

1282
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,990
Speaker 7:  like, oh we gotta start announcing some stuff and then last year we should

1283
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:42,750
Speaker 7:  talk about meta Mark Zuckerberg is having like a religious experience it

1284
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:46,550
Speaker 7:  seems like. Oh he went to like the Church of

1285
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:50,430
Speaker 7:  Prophets. I was like, we need to make them because he got, you know,

1286
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:53,430
Speaker 7:  he was like, he spent all of his time being like, I'm do the metaverse billions

1287
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:57,110
Speaker 7:  of dollars, let's lose all the money. And then app tracking

1288
01:10:57,110 --> 01:11:00,190
Speaker 7:  transparency happened, the market crashed, the advertising market crashed.

1289
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:04,070
Speaker 7:  TikTok happened. Instagram stopped being cool and now

1290
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:08,030
Speaker 7:  he is like, I gotta fire everybody. I don't want managers, managing managers,

1291
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:11,950
Speaker 7:  managing managers, I want people to do stuff so maybe we're gonna get more

1292
01:11:11,950 --> 01:11:14,080
Speaker 7:  efficient. And then he had this earnings call where he, he said the word

1293
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:17,240
Speaker 7:  efficiency 500 times in a row. Oof.

1294
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:21,480
Speaker 7:  Which is like, that just means he is gonna

1295
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:22,320
Speaker 7:  start clipping people.

1296
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:27,480
Speaker 8:  Yeah, you're gonna be doing a little bit more with a little bit less. But

1297
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:30,160
Speaker 8:  e, even with all the bad news that we've had about Facebook, about the growth,

1298
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:34,040
Speaker 8:  about how many people are using it, they record over 2 billion daily

1299
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:37,480
Speaker 8:  active users in this last quarter, the highest that we've ever seen. And

1300
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:40,680
Speaker 8:  I wonder what's going on there? Is it because we've got the apps kind of

1301
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:43,880
Speaker 8:  integrated now all of your logins are shared. Like what, what is, what is

1302
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:46,080
Speaker 8:  causing these, these numbers that we're seeing is, is this real? So

1303
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:50,160
Speaker 7:  From what I'm seeing here, it's the 2 billion is Facebook itself the

1304
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:53,080
Speaker 7:  blue app and then the family of apps is

1305
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:56,920
Speaker 7:  3.7 billion people monthly across family of apps on Facebook

1306
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:00,760
Speaker 7:  it's 2 billion daily actives. That's crazy. And I is it just that they added

1307
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:04,600
Speaker 7:  reels to Facebook? Oh boy. Like at

1308
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,960
Speaker 7:  this point it's like you open the thing and like it just starts playing video

1309
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:10,920
Speaker 7:  at you, right? They just boosted talk's, move. What they don't have is

1310
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:14,600
Speaker 7:  any monetization strategy for this stuff yet or any creator strategy for

1311
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:18,560
Speaker 7:  this stuff or really any strategy for this stuff. They're just

1312
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:19,040
Speaker 7:  like, screw it. You

1313
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,480
Speaker 8:  They have NFTs on Instagram I

1314
01:12:22,450 --> 01:12:23,640
Speaker 7:  That'll do it. You

1315
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,640
Speaker 8:  You will non fungible these tokens

1316
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:29,880
Speaker 7:  That that'll do it. That is, oh no, Zuckerberg on the call pointed

1317
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:33,400
Speaker 7:  out people like reels. That's what people like. Reels don't have as many

1318
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:36,520
Speaker 7:  ads, they don't have as many ad products. So he is like, we gotta optimize,

1319
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:40,480
Speaker 7:  we gotta make it more efficient how we monetize reels just that

1320
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:43,920
Speaker 7:  word again. See I think they're just in the part of the Facebook growth curve

1321
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:47,120
Speaker 7:  where they're like, here's all the stuff you like reels have at it and they're

1322
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:50,560
Speaker 7:  gonna start adding ads onto it. And I feel like this happened, Instagram

1323
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:54,200
Speaker 7:  already five times in a row we're like, Instagram was great and then Instagram

1324
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:57,200
Speaker 7:  was shit and then they were like fixed it. They made a crap again. And that's

1325
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:01,000
Speaker 7:  what's gonna happen to reels all this in the context of YouTube adding creator

1326
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,760
Speaker 7:  monetization and in the context of TikTok basically just being like under

1327
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:08,600
Speaker 7:  attack from everybody. Like there's not a big tech company or at

1328
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,720
Speaker 7:  this point a politician America who's like, we should have TikTok in this

1329
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:15,440
Speaker 7:  country. So there's just a weird that

1330
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:19,480
Speaker 7:  weird scrolling video moment. I think we're gonna look back

1331
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:22,120
Speaker 7:  on it in five years and be like, this was one of the weirdest periods in

1332
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:24,880
Speaker 7:  tech when everyone was like, here's what you want. You want vertical video

1333
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,520
Speaker 7:  to scroll by as fast as we can make it. And mostly it's weird people dancing

1334
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:32,320
Speaker 7:  like, and we're just, I think we're just gonna look back on this video. This

1335
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:36,080
Speaker 7:  is such a weird format war. Like there's like H D D D and Blu-ray

1336
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:39,440
Speaker 7:  and there's gonna be reels versus shorts versus TikTok and we're gonna be

1337
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:42,640
Speaker 7:  like, that was bizarre because by the end of it, I think the government's

1338
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:46,520
Speaker 7:  gonna have booted TikTok out of the country and Facebook and YouTube

1339
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:50,440
Speaker 7:  are going to have realized that these products don't monetize as well as

1340
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:54,280
Speaker 7:  regular long form video on YouTube or Facebook's

1341
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:57,760
Speaker 7:  other monetization products and they're gonna start to decline them in relevance

1342
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,880
Speaker 7:  in their algorithms. That's my prediction then

1343
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:00,960
Speaker 8:  You need more efficiency,

1344
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:04,760
Speaker 7:  You need more efficiency. Just get more efficient. Yeah, I mean I'll say

1345
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,800
Speaker 7:  this is the last thing actually these two headlines together are great.

1346
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:12,160
Speaker 7:  I think they're very funny. Perfect example of where the government is at

1347
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:15,880
Speaker 7:  with the tech regulation right now. White House goes after App store

1348
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:19,520
Speaker 7:  gatekeepers, apple and Google. So Commerce department was like, you guys

1349
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,640
Speaker 7:  are gatekeepers, you gotta open the floodgates, you gotta let more things

1350
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:26,240
Speaker 7:  happen on your phones. Apple and Google face mounting pressure to remove

1351
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:28,840
Speaker 7:  TikTok from their app stores. It's like guys,

1352
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:33,560
Speaker 7:  either you open the gates and you're like stop being the gatekeepers. Or

1353
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:37,640
Speaker 7:  you say use your power to boot this app off your phones

1354
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:41,760
Speaker 7:  by removing it from the store you you cannot have both things.

1355
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:44,720
Speaker 9:  Open the gates but not like that.

1356
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:45,840
Speaker 7:  Exactly.

1357
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:47,400
Speaker 9:  Shut a little bit.

1358
01:14:47,870 --> 01:14:51,560
Speaker 7:  I say this is like a totally weird moment, right where TikTok is still in

1359
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:55,480
Speaker 7:  its ascendancy culturally for sure because the Chinese government pours

1360
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:59,200
Speaker 7:  money into bite dance and we bite Dance is not a public

1361
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:03,080
Speaker 7:  company so we have no idea how it works here. We we can't see

1362
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:06,360
Speaker 7:  into the company to see if it's growing or the advertising working. And then

1363
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:09,840
Speaker 7:  these other competitors are all public companies that are losing money because

1364
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,360
Speaker 7:  the market sound all this other stuff and they're under pressure to compete

1365
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:15,240
Speaker 7:  with TikTok and it's just a weird dynamic where the answer is gonna be

1366
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:19,800
Speaker 7:  Facebook convinces the United States government to ban TikTok. I swear to

1367
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:23,280
Speaker 7:  you this is going to happen. This is gonna be great. All right, we gotta

1368
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:27,120
Speaker 7:  wrap this up. We are over as always, I wanna call out some things we great

1369
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:30,840
Speaker 7:  piece about the EV price war or my contributor to the Virgin named Patrick George.

1370
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:34,920
Speaker 7:  Basically his thesis is like, you see the Mustang MA get a price reduction,

1371
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:38,720
Speaker 7:  you see the Tesla get a price reduction. Wait, just wait until there's actual

1372
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:42,040
Speaker 7:  competition in this market and that's good. I'm gonna call it Sean Holster

1373
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:45,400
Speaker 7:  who has just dogged the UFI company for claims about

1374
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:48,760
Speaker 7:  encryption on its home security cameras. I mean you just gotta read the lead

1375
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:52,080
Speaker 7:  of his piece. It's like first they lied, then they deflected, then they lied

1376
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:55,640
Speaker 7:  again and now they've told me the truth. And the truth is the cameras were

1377
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:58,120
Speaker 7:  not encrypted and he has all the responses.

1378
01:15:58,330 --> 01:16:02,000
Speaker 9:  No, they had a lot of words for non-encrypted.

1379
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,800
Speaker 9:  That's it's a fascinating read.

1380
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:08,880
Speaker 8:  Yeah. In to end encryption in in somehow became

1381
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:11,800
Speaker 8:  into not really, yeah,

1382
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:16,120
Speaker 7:  End of somewhere. I wanna call it Addie Robertson who

1383
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:19,920
Speaker 7:  wrote an Amma, the great headline, the okay computer about the Lisa,

1384
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:23,840
Speaker 7:  the Apple, Lisa, it's the history of the Lisa. We've got a big partnership

1385
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:27,200
Speaker 7:  with the Computer history museum to make stuff like this. So this is part

1386
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:30,680
Speaker 7:  of that partnership. It's an amazing piece. Which was the history, the genesis

1387
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:34,480
Speaker 7:  of Lisa. This thing obviously failed. You can tell that the Verge loves fail

1388
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:38,400
Speaker 7:  technology. We're like Springboard the Lisa, this is what we

1389
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:38,880
Speaker 7:  do here.

1390
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:41,000
Speaker 9:  The sob stories.

1391
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:44,160
Speaker 7:  There's actually much more to come on Lisa coverage cuz of the anniversary.

1392
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:47,960
Speaker 7:  We, there's a big event at the Computer History museum. It was like adorable.

1393
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:51,320
Speaker 7:  All the people worked on Lisa over there. It was fun. We, we sent a bunch

1394
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:55,200
Speaker 7:  of people there. And then lastly, I got a shout out Mia

1395
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:58,960
Speaker 7:  who wrote, I would say a disappointing piece. Like the piece is good, excellent

1396
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:01,320
Speaker 7:  reporting. Mia's a great reporter, well-written the whole thing. But the

1397
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:05,280
Speaker 7:  piece is disappointing about CNET and this private equity company that

1398
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:08,320
Speaker 7:  is like hollowing it out from the inside and it's our direct competitor.

1399
01:17:08,330 --> 01:17:11,760
Speaker 7:  So there's your disclosure. I know that CNN's our competitor, but we know

1400
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:15,560
Speaker 7:  a lot of people in the CNN newsroom, they have been a great competitor for

1401
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:19,480
Speaker 7:  a long time and now it's like a private equity VUL is turning

1402
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:23,040
Speaker 7:  it into this like SEO driven machine. It is worth reading.

1403
01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:26,360
Speaker 7:  I keep going on and about Google as Alison mentioned, like Google search

1404
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:29,840
Speaker 7:  results are getting worse. Why are they getting worse? Because companies

1405
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:33,680
Speaker 7:  are getting better at gaming Google. And so like the architecture of the

1406
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:37,520
Speaker 7:  web is like based on Google's influences and the CNET story

1407
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:41,320
Speaker 7:  is like a microcosm of what happens when you pivot

1408
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:45,160
Speaker 7:  from making good stuff to making things you think Google will like. And there's

1409
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:48,480
Speaker 7:  a real difference in that. We'll see them, but

1410
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:52,680
Speaker 7:  okay, that's it. Go read all that stuff. Thanks to Monica for joining
