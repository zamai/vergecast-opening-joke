Speaker 3:  Woo hoo. Alex is from Texas. It's

13
00:01:07,325 --> 00:01:09,165
Speaker 5:  True. That's why I wear my little cowboy boots today.

14
00:01:09,475 --> 00:01:10,245
Speaker 3:  Where's your hat?

00:01:13,355 --> 00:01:15,365
Speaker 5:  Also in Fort Worth. Sorry.

18
00:01:15,715 --> 00:01:16,685
Speaker 3:  Very good. David Pierce

19
00:01:16,705 --> 00:01:20,325
Speaker 4:  Is here. I have no cowboy hats. I wore a cowboy hat one time and literally

20
00:01:20,565 --> 00:01:23,845
Speaker 4:  a stranger told me I looked stupid in it. That's a true story.

21
00:01:24,525 --> 00:01:25,405
Speaker 5:  I think you look cute in

22
00:01:25,405 --> 00:01:28,325
Speaker 4:  Water. It was. They were like trying to be nice, but it was very much a like

23
00:01:28,615 --> 00:01:31,445
Speaker 4:  honey, like that's not for you. Take it off kind of vibe. And I just, that

24
00:01:31,445 --> 00:01:33,045
Speaker 4:  was the end of my cowboy hat face. It's fair.

25
00:01:33,045 --> 00:01:36,445
Speaker 3:  That's fair. Were you wearing it in a cowboy hat? Appropriate situation?

26
00:01:36,595 --> 00:01:37,685
Speaker 4:  Evidently not. Were you

27
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:38,685
Speaker 3:  Like at the bank? Yeah,

28
00:01:39,005 --> 00:01:41,365
Speaker 5:  I was in Austin. That's cowboy hat appropriate. Yeah.

29
00:01:41,365 --> 00:01:43,285
Speaker 3:  Like, well, it depends on where the bank is. Yeah, that's

30
00:01:43,285 --> 00:01:47,245
Speaker 5:  True. New York. No, no. Austin kind of Fort

31
00:01:47,245 --> 00:01:48,045
Speaker 5:  Worth. Definitely. See,

32
00:01:48,045 --> 00:01:49,645
Speaker 3:  You can see the Texas is coming out Alex now. Yeah.

33
00:01:49,645 --> 00:01:50,845
Speaker 4:  We're learning things here. This is good.

34
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:53,085
Speaker 3:  Yeah. All right. So here's what we're gonna do for this live bird chat. By

35
00:01:53,085 --> 00:01:55,005
Speaker 3:  the way, if you're listening to this in your car, we have an audience here

36
00:01:55,005 --> 00:01:57,565
Speaker 3:  at South by Southwest makes noise audience. Woo.

37
00:01:59,355 --> 00:02:03,005
Speaker 3:  Very good. I'm very excited for this

38
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:06,165
Speaker 3:  ridiculous gimmick that David has come up with. It's very, very complicated.

39
00:02:06,165 --> 00:02:08,765
Speaker 3:  Explain what we're gonna do and we're gonna, we're gonna play this game that

40
00:02:08,765 --> 00:02:11,005
Speaker 3:  David's come up with it at the end, we'll have some questions, but explain

41
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:11,405
Speaker 3:  the game.

42
00:02:11,635 --> 00:02:15,165
Speaker 4:  Okay. So about a year ago, we were trying to figure out

43
00:02:15,545 --> 00:02:19,125
Speaker 4:  how to talk about the Streaming world and like who's up, who's down, who's

44
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:23,005
Speaker 4:  winning, who's losing? So we did this Draft and we all basically picked a

45
00:02:23,005 --> 00:02:26,605
Speaker 4:  bunch of Streaming services that are like hours for the year. And then everything

46
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:30,045
Speaker 4:  changed. Like immediately between recording that episode and putting out

47
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:32,725
Speaker 4:  that episode, the whole Streaming world changed. So now we're gonna do it

48
00:02:32,725 --> 00:02:35,885
Speaker 4:  again. We're gonna go back. I've made it more complicated and it's gonna

49
00:02:35,885 --> 00:02:38,725
Speaker 4:  be much more work for everybody and I'm the only one who can see everything.

50
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:39,845
Speaker 4:  So I'm gonna win for sure.

51
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:40,885
Speaker 3:  David's gonna cheat.

52
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:41,845
Speaker 5:  Yeah, he's cheating.

53
00:02:42,505 --> 00:02:46,245
Speaker 4:  But we, we need help from all of you a few times throughout this first

54
00:02:46,395 --> 00:02:50,325
Speaker 4:  telling us who is going to pick first. I'm gonna explain the rules of

55
00:02:50,325 --> 00:02:52,885
Speaker 4:  the Draft in a second, but the first thing we need to do is I'm gonna recap

56
00:02:52,885 --> 00:02:56,765
Speaker 4:  last year and then y'all are gonna decide who won last year's Draft

57
00:02:56,785 --> 00:03:00,645
Speaker 4:  and thus gets to go first. Does that sound good? Okay. Cool. So last year,

58
00:03:00,995 --> 00:03:04,605
Speaker 4:  NELI Patel ended up, we each ended up with five things. NELI had

59
00:03:04,705 --> 00:03:08,485
Speaker 4:  TikTok, the Disney bundle, YouTube TV with Sunday

60
00:03:08,485 --> 00:03:11,085
Speaker 4:  Ticket. I don't know why we gave you both of the This is outrageous. Yeah.

61
00:03:11,085 --> 00:03:12,925
Speaker 4:  I murdered, in retrospect, outrageous. There's

62
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:15,445
Speaker 3:  0% chance that anyone did better than me in this drive. Go ahead.

63
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:18,965
Speaker 4:  Apple Music. Yep. And his friend Bin's. Plex Server

64
00:03:19,525 --> 00:03:20,045
Speaker 4:  AKA a choice

65
00:03:20,175 --> 00:03:21,645
Speaker 5:  Right To jail. Like not even mine. Vi.

66
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:23,725
Speaker 3:  I didn't pick Alex's weirdo Plex Server.

67
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:24,165
Speaker 4:  It's

68
00:03:24,165 --> 00:03:24,525
Speaker 5:  Way better.

69
00:03:24,835 --> 00:03:28,525
Speaker 4:  Alex. Cranz picked HBO Max Wwo. aw.

70
00:03:29,115 --> 00:03:32,845
Speaker 4:  Paramount Plus slash Showtime. Aw channels

71
00:03:32,985 --> 00:03:36,405
Speaker 4:  the app for watching the internet. It rules still exists. That one's good.

72
00:03:36,595 --> 00:03:37,205
Speaker 4:  Criterion.

73
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,205
Speaker 5:  It still exists.

74
00:03:38,735 --> 00:03:39,445
Speaker 4:  Apple One

75
00:03:39,855 --> 00:03:40,205
Speaker 5:  Still

76
00:03:40,205 --> 00:03:43,485
Speaker 3:  Exists. But that that, I don't know how you got away with that one because

77
00:03:43,485 --> 00:03:44,485
Speaker 5:  You got Disney Bundle.

78
00:03:45,185 --> 00:03:47,925
Speaker 3:  So you picked the bundle that includes iCloud and

79
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:51,485
Speaker 4:  Well, no, she got, it was basically music and Apple TV plus. Yeah. Is the,

80
00:03:51,485 --> 00:03:54,965
Speaker 4:  that was the idea. And then Alex got a bonus pick because she spent the least

81
00:03:54,965 --> 00:03:58,925
Speaker 4:  money. Yes. And she picked Xbox Cloud Gaming, which was a

82
00:03:58,925 --> 00:03:59,085
Speaker 4:  choice.

83
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:03,165
Speaker 5:  It was a very entertaining pick. Like everything I would, I would, I would

84
00:04:03,355 --> 00:04:05,645
Speaker 5:  pick all of those again in 2023.

85
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:09,485
Speaker 4:  I don't recommend that. My picks were YouTube, premium Peacock, Netflix,

86
00:04:09,755 --> 00:04:13,445
Speaker 4:  discovery plus W, WAMP and Hulu with live tv.

87
00:04:14,385 --> 00:04:17,805
Speaker 4:  So I won. I know I just said a lot of things all in a row.

88
00:04:18,185 --> 00:04:20,045
Speaker 4:  Who thinks NELI won the Draft? Obviously

89
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:22,525
Speaker 3:  Nothing dead silent in this

90
00:04:22,525 --> 00:04:23,405
Speaker 4:  Room. In your

91
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:24,805
Speaker 3:  Face. 'cause I talked too much shit.

92
00:04:24,985 --> 00:04:26,525
Speaker 4:  Who thinks Alex won the Draft? Yes.

93
00:04:26,555 --> 00:04:28,725
Speaker 5:  Come on. Cheer. Yes.

94
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:31,525
Speaker 3:  Are

95
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:32,765
Speaker 4:  You? I saw that. I

96
00:04:32,765 --> 00:04:33,245
Speaker 5:  Brought Ringers.

97
00:04:33,345 --> 00:04:34,805
Speaker 3:  Oh my God. He's def David's definitely.

98
00:04:35,245 --> 00:04:36,365
Speaker 4:  Who thinks David won the Draft?

99
00:04:39,855 --> 00:04:43,525
Speaker 4:  Katie Drummond clapped for me. So I won the Draft. Okay, so

100
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:47,125
Speaker 4:  the rules of this Draft Alex, you're gonna get to go first 'cause I think

101
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,165
Speaker 4:  you actually won the Draft. Thank you. Neela. I NELI can in last is what

102
00:04:50,195 --> 00:04:52,725
Speaker 4:  Neil, I lost now. That's the most important part. NELI

103
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:53,485
Speaker 3:  Lost. It's brutal.

104
00:04:53,785 --> 00:04:57,285
Speaker 4:  So for this year, the, the new addition to the Draft is we have categories

105
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:01,285
Speaker 4:  and you can't just pick anything. You have to fill the categories with

106
00:05:01,285 --> 00:05:04,405
Speaker 4:  Draft picks. And we have six categories. Like I said, this is gonna be very

107
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:07,285
Speaker 4:  complicated. You both have this on your phone, so you can check it as you'd

108
00:05:07,285 --> 00:05:07,805
Speaker 4:  like to. I like,

109
00:05:07,805 --> 00:05:09,045
Speaker 5:  Can I have my phone out?

110
00:05:09,105 --> 00:05:12,885
Speaker 4:  The categories are cheap, which means it has to have a tier that costs

111
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:17,045
Speaker 4:  under 10 bucks awards, which means the Streaming service has to have won

112
00:05:17,045 --> 00:05:20,965
Speaker 4:  an Oscar. An Oscar, not something else. An Oscar. There's 4K,

113
00:05:20,965 --> 00:05:24,005
Speaker 4:  which is pretty self-explanatory. It has to have seven in 4K, which rules

114
00:05:24,005 --> 00:05:27,805
Speaker 4:  out a surprising number, but we can talk about that live, which means

115
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:31,325
Speaker 4:  it has to have some live stuff niche, which means it has to be something

116
00:05:31,435 --> 00:05:34,245
Speaker 4:  very specific. And we can litigate that as we, this is

117
00:05:34,245 --> 00:05:35,925
Speaker 3:  The Alex Cranz memorial category.

118
00:05:36,425 --> 00:05:39,645
Speaker 4:  And then there's Wild Card, which is anything you want. Yeah. So we're not

119
00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:42,605
Speaker 4:  going in category order, but there are going to be six rounds of the Draft.

120
00:05:42,605 --> 00:05:46,365
Speaker 4:  And it is your job to fill out all six categories over the course of the

121
00:05:46,365 --> 00:05:49,805
Speaker 4:  Draft. Oh my God. Sound good? Everybody feel good? Do this? Yeah. All right.

122
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:52,405
Speaker 4:  Alex Cranz. All right, you're up first. So you have to pick a service and

123
00:05:52,445 --> 00:05:52,885
Speaker 4:  a category.

124
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:56,725
Speaker 5:  Okay. I'm gonna go 4K for my first one, and I'm gonna choose

125
00:05:56,725 --> 00:06:00,575
Speaker 5:  Netflix. Okay. Because I've gotten really into KDRs. All right.

126
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:03,855
Speaker 5:  And they've got a lot on there. Strong and also other, it's Netflix.

127
00:06:04,035 --> 00:06:07,855
Speaker 3:  So here's my proposed wild card edition to this Draft. Oh, good. Okay.

128
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:11,055
Speaker 3:  Every time anyone says a Streaming service, we have to rank how close to

129
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:14,895
Speaker 3:  death the Streaming service is on the go. 90 scale

130
00:06:14,915 --> 00:06:15,935
Speaker 3:  of Doom Streaming, because

131
00:06:15,935 --> 00:06:18,375
Speaker 4:  It turns out several of them last year were very close to

132
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,975
Speaker 3:  That. Very close to that. Yeah. So If, you are in our audience. you know

133
00:06:20,975 --> 00:06:24,215
Speaker 3:  what the Go 90 scale of Doom Streaming services is Verizon,

134
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:29,055
Speaker 3:  which is a cell phone carrier, launched just important fact

135
00:06:29,185 --> 00:06:33,175
Speaker 3:  along this road, launched a competitor YouTube called Go 90. This is

136
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:36,975
Speaker 3:  ages ago. The competitor featured the ability to turn your phone

137
00:06:37,255 --> 00:06:40,855
Speaker 3:  sideways to watch videos and landscape, which Verizon tried to brand going

138
00:06:40,855 --> 00:06:44,375
Speaker 3:  90. This is a real thing that happened from one of our nation's largest

139
00:06:44,815 --> 00:06:48,535
Speaker 3:  companies. They also had features in it called like, join a Crew because

140
00:06:48,535 --> 00:06:52,375
Speaker 3:  they thought the youth would like gang related terminology in their video

141
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:56,175
Speaker 3:  apps. This, this is all real. I'm not making this up. No, it qui

142
00:06:56,175 --> 00:06:59,215
Speaker 3:  it quickly failed. Like I, I can't even tell you how fast it failed. It went

143
00:06:59,215 --> 00:07:03,135
Speaker 3:  90. Yeah. Much like Quibi, another service that was

144
00:07:03,135 --> 00:07:06,735
Speaker 3:  predicated upon turning your phone to watch videos and landscape. So we have

145
00:07:06,735 --> 00:07:10,575
Speaker 3:  the Go 90 scale of Zoom Streaming services. So Zero is

146
00:07:10,895 --> 00:07:14,335
Speaker 3:  Alive, 90 is dead. So Alex, where

147
00:07:15,115 --> 00:07:18,015
Speaker 3:  is Netflix on the go? 90 scale of Doom Streaming services.

148
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:21,175
Speaker 5:  Okay. I'm about, to be really honest, I mainly picked it so neither of you

149
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:22,935
Speaker 5:  could pick it because I actually,

150
00:07:22,935 --> 00:07:24,655
Speaker 3:  There's a lot of gamesmanship in this stream. Yeah.

151
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:28,415
Speaker 5:  It's, it's all about beating them and feeling good about myself. So,

152
00:07:28,575 --> 00:07:32,095
Speaker 5:  I actually think it's like a 40 because I a 40 because I think they have

153
00:07:32,135 --> 00:07:35,175
Speaker 5:  a lot of programming problems and they need to improve it. Yeah. Like, I

154
00:07:35,175 --> 00:07:38,695
Speaker 5:  like the K dramas, but I don't know if everyone else likes to

155
00:07:38,695 --> 00:07:42,415
Speaker 4:  Wait. But Alex, I would remind you that the scale is not like the the

156
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:44,455
Speaker 4:  suckiness scale of its program. Yeah.

157
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:44,935
Speaker 5:  No,

158
00:07:44,935 --> 00:07:46,455
Speaker 4:  But it, the scale of doesn't exist

159
00:07:47,035 --> 00:07:49,015
Speaker 5:  In a year. Yeah. Okay. You

160
00:07:49,015 --> 00:07:49,735
Speaker 3:  Don't have to say in a year.

161
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,295
Speaker 5:  Is it like, yeah. Does it exist?

162
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,175
Speaker 3:  How, how close to death in this moment? Right?

163
00:07:54,135 --> 00:07:57,775
Speaker 5:  Hmm. I still think like 40. I kind wanna say 40.

164
00:07:58,015 --> 00:08:00,735
Speaker 5:  I, I, I'm, I'm out there. Like, I think Netflix has some issues.

165
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:04,655
Speaker 3:  Feel, feel like it. This moment in time, it's appropriate to do our disclosures.

166
00:08:06,225 --> 00:08:07,775
Speaker 3:  Where are you at? I produced a Netflix show.

167
00:08:09,565 --> 00:08:13,535
Speaker 3:  Very good about The. future of You should watch it. Our company has a significant

168
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,055
Speaker 3:  investment in it from NBCUniversal, which is owned by Comcast.

169
00:08:17,285 --> 00:08:20,535
Speaker 3:  They don't like us very much at all, given our coverage of Comcast.

170
00:08:21,475 --> 00:08:24,455
Speaker 3:  We make other television shows for other services at our company.

171
00:08:25,595 --> 00:08:27,975
Speaker 3:  And I personally watch television.

172
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:28,695
Speaker 5:  Yes.

173
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:29,975
Speaker 3:  Quite a bit.

174
00:08:31,165 --> 00:08:34,015
Speaker 4:  Alex does you but only illegally, so it's fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We don't

175
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:34,695
Speaker 4:  have to disclose that.

176
00:08:35,005 --> 00:08:38,455
Speaker 3:  Yeah. We all have Apple products. It's a very important disclosure. Go ahead.

177
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:42,695
Speaker 4:  All right, I'll let you go next because I'm feeling magnanimous today.

178
00:08:43,915 --> 00:08:44,615
Speaker 4:  What's your first thought?

179
00:08:44,645 --> 00:08:47,975
Speaker 3:  Reverse serpentine order? Yeah. All right. I'm start, I'm starting where

180
00:08:47,975 --> 00:08:49,815
Speaker 3:  I started last year. TikTok,

181
00:08:50,305 --> 00:08:51,135
Speaker 4:  Which category?

182
00:08:51,775 --> 00:08:52,575
Speaker 3:  Cheap, famous

183
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:53,215
Speaker 4:  Oscar winning

184
00:08:53,635 --> 00:08:57,565
Speaker 3:  TikTok is notably cheap. Okay. It's funded entirely by subsidies

185
00:08:57,565 --> 00:09:01,085
Speaker 3:  from the Chinese government and extremely crap

186
00:09:01,485 --> 00:09:02,925
Speaker 3:  garbage that is sold on the TikTok

187
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:05,765
Speaker 4:  Shop. You, you did see the band bill that was passed. Oh

188
00:09:05,765 --> 00:09:09,365
Speaker 3:  Yeah. TikTok currently is in the last s about, it's

189
00:09:10,105 --> 00:09:14,005
Speaker 3:  TikTok is about it in 89. Okay. It is the clo it is the most

190
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,805
Speaker 3:  alive thing that has ever been that close to death in the history of stream

191
00:09:16,805 --> 00:09:18,005
Speaker 3:  Streaming services. The

192
00:09:18,005 --> 00:09:21,885
Speaker 4:  Most alive. Th Okay. Right. Sure. It is the whole go 90 scale

193
00:09:21,905 --> 00:09:22,645
Speaker 4:  all at once. Yeah.

194
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,645
Speaker 3:  Yeah. but it, it just, it is the full spectrum of go 90.

195
00:09:26,715 --> 00:09:28,765
Speaker 3:  Have you ever seen those tiktoks where it's like, turn your phones slowly,

196
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:32,725
Speaker 3:  is the plane flies? It's that, it's that thing. Can I,

197
00:09:32,725 --> 00:09:36,405
Speaker 3:  this fact about TikTok today is to me, very funny. The SE

198
00:09:36,405 --> 00:09:40,245
Speaker 3:  Forge just had this reporting. So TikTok had a full screen

199
00:09:41,065 --> 00:09:44,805
Speaker 3:  un killable splash screen load that said, call your representative

200
00:09:45,315 --> 00:09:49,205
Speaker 3:  yesterday. And the only things you could do were

201
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:53,165
Speaker 3:  force quit the app or call your representative. You had no other choices

202
00:09:53,195 --> 00:09:56,885
Speaker 3:  like If, you wanted to engage with TikTok. Those were your choices. So Capitol

203
00:09:56,915 --> 00:10:00,605
Speaker 3:  Hill was flooded with calls from angry teens and there was one quote

204
00:10:01,195 --> 00:10:04,765
Speaker 3:  from one congressional office. We, our offices are flooded with calls from

205
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:07,605
Speaker 3:  angry teens and boomers who spend all day on the app.

206
00:10:09,845 --> 00:10:11,485
Speaker 3:  Really expands the definition of TikTok

207
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:14,125
Speaker 4:  There. I just love a bunch of teens being like, this is the first phone call

208
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,725
Speaker 4:  I've made in my life. Yeah. Give me TikTok.

209
00:10:17,245 --> 00:10:20,885
Speaker 3:  I need this. So you would think that this would work. Other apps have

210
00:10:20,885 --> 00:10:24,845
Speaker 3:  famously done this. Uber famously did this to get, you know, preferential

211
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:28,605
Speaker 3:  treatment in cities around the world during the uber time. This utterly

212
00:10:28,605 --> 00:10:32,285
Speaker 3:  backfired on TikTok, congressional Republicans. The bill

213
00:10:32,305 --> 00:10:35,965
Speaker 3:  sailed through to basically punish app stores that they carry TikTok. That's

214
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:39,125
Speaker 3:  how they're how're gonna do it. They're saying this is an, you know, the

215
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:42,525
Speaker 3:  stuff that congressional Republicans say China's bad. And in the accent,

216
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:46,205
Speaker 3:  and the quote they gave to se for was, we're worried the Chinese government

217
00:10:46,425 --> 00:10:49,365
Speaker 3:  is programming our teenagers minds. And this is proof

218
00:10:49,955 --> 00:10:52,005
Speaker 3:  because they got all the teens to call. They made

219
00:10:52,005 --> 00:10:52,405
Speaker 4:  Phone calls.

220
00:10:53,565 --> 00:10:55,325
Speaker 3:  I mean, it's very good.

221
00:10:56,145 --> 00:10:57,205
Speaker 4:  The teens did call.

222
00:10:57,395 --> 00:10:57,885
Speaker 3:  They did,

223
00:10:58,035 --> 00:10:59,125
Speaker 4:  They did program the teens

224
00:10:59,185 --> 00:11:01,325
Speaker 3:  To call. And for some reason they're all speaking Mandarin. Right. It's very

225
00:11:01,325 --> 00:11:05,085
Speaker 3:  confusing. Yeah. It's crazy. Anyway, so it's, it's in 89, but I'm taking

226
00:11:05,085 --> 00:11:06,525
Speaker 3:  it first off the board. I feel good about it.

227
00:11:06,675 --> 00:11:10,245
Speaker 4:  Okay. Fair enough. What about you? I'm, I'm torn.

228
00:11:10,775 --> 00:11:14,245
Speaker 4:  Apple TV won an Oscar. It did. That's a thing that happened. Yeah. For quota.

229
00:11:14,825 --> 00:11:18,805
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna take Apple TV plus in the awards category, Ooh for my first

230
00:11:18,805 --> 00:11:21,965
Speaker 4:  pick. I hate you, but good. I think there's a decent chance that is going

231
00:11:21,965 --> 00:11:25,525
Speaker 4:  to be the most complicated category. 'cause it turns out not a lot of

232
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:29,445
Speaker 4:  Oscars in those. So I'm taking that one on the go. 90 scale.

233
00:11:30,195 --> 00:11:34,005
Speaker 4:  It's like a six. Yeah. Like it's, apple just has all the money in the

234
00:11:34,245 --> 00:11:38,165
Speaker 4:  universe and Eddie Q just like hangs out in LA and does

235
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,325
Speaker 4:  whatever he wants. Yeah.

236
00:11:39,325 --> 00:11:41,325
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Tim Cook likes Ted Lasso. Yeah.

237
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:44,765
Speaker 4:  He's like friends with Lion o Messi now that's like, it's great. Yeah.

238
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:49,085
Speaker 3:  I will say that Apple keeps claiming that its movies make money and they

239
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:50,445
Speaker 3:  definitely don't. Well,

240
00:11:50,445 --> 00:11:52,165
Speaker 4:  It was great 'cause there was, there was a, they do make money,

241
00:11:52,235 --> 00:11:54,445
Speaker 5:  Just they don't, not enough profit. Yeah. Right.

242
00:11:55,345 --> 00:11:57,805
Speaker 4:  And it was one of those things where they were like, we spent all this money

243
00:11:57,905 --> 00:12:00,805
Speaker 4:  on, you know, a handful of huge movies, killers of Flower Moon, and a couple

244
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:04,645
Speaker 4:  of others famously invested like $700 million into a few movies. And

245
00:12:04,645 --> 00:12:06,685
Speaker 4:  they're like, but they're super profitable. And there were a bunch of people

246
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:09,405
Speaker 4:  who are like, you know, we can see the box office data, right? Like, it's

247
00:12:09,405 --> 00:12:13,085
Speaker 4:  just, it's just right there. And, and it's just adding three numbers

248
00:12:13,155 --> 00:12:16,725
Speaker 4:  that don't come anywhere near 700 million. But like, whatever.

249
00:12:17,075 --> 00:12:18,645
Speaker 4:  It's Apple's fine. Apple's

250
00:12:18,645 --> 00:12:19,165
Speaker 3:  Fine. I'm

251
00:12:19,165 --> 00:12:21,685
Speaker 4:  Not worried about Apple TV plus making a profit for Apple.

252
00:12:21,925 --> 00:12:24,845
Speaker 3:  I will say that everyone says it's the best one. Like people are like it.

253
00:12:24,955 --> 00:12:28,805
Speaker 3:  It's the new HBO. And my fundamental belief is like, some things are very

254
00:12:28,805 --> 00:12:32,445
Speaker 3:  good and then the things that are very bad are some of the most comically

255
00:12:32,505 --> 00:12:36,405
Speaker 3:  bad things anyone has ever spent money on. Like Apple. You can't open an

256
00:12:36,405 --> 00:12:38,965
Speaker 3:  Apple TV right now without it being like, you're gonna watch Argyle. And

257
00:12:38,965 --> 00:12:42,885
Speaker 3:  it's like, no, I'm not Like I read the reviews

258
00:12:42,885 --> 00:12:45,645
Speaker 3:  of Argyle. I've seen other people react to the concept of Argyle.

259
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:49,365
Speaker 4:  I saw Argyle in theaters. What is wrong? I don't know.

260
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:50,285
Speaker 3:  You have a child.

261
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:50,765
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

262
00:12:50,985 --> 00:12:51,885
Speaker 4:  He was asleep. It was,

263
00:12:52,465 --> 00:12:54,365
Speaker 5:  Did you, did you pay for a babysitter?

264
00:12:54,785 --> 00:12:58,045
Speaker 4:  No, I, the honest, I went alone. The honestly true story is

265
00:12:58,575 --> 00:12:59,285
Speaker 4:  alone. I did,

266
00:12:59,465 --> 00:13:00,005
Speaker 3:  Oh my God,

267
00:13:01,665 --> 00:13:05,525
Speaker 4:  My wife is in, is doing grad school again because she collects Master's

268
00:13:05,525 --> 00:13:09,405
Speaker 4:  degrees. I had nothing to do while she was

269
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:13,085
Speaker 4:  in class and my child was asleep. And So I was like, I'm gonna go to a movie.

270
00:13:13,105 --> 00:13:16,405
Speaker 4:  And the literal only thing playing at the time that I wanted to see it was

271
00:13:16,405 --> 00:13:16,765
Speaker 4:  ar Kyle,

272
00:13:17,385 --> 00:13:20,325
Speaker 3:  Should I watch it for free? And Apple TV plus this is what I mean, the hit

273
00:13:20,325 --> 00:13:22,045
Speaker 3:  rate is, is, is is good.

274
00:13:22,065 --> 00:13:23,165
Speaker 4:  Argyle is a movie to

275
00:13:23,165 --> 00:13:23,685
Speaker 3:  Watch solid,

276
00:13:23,685 --> 00:13:27,605
Speaker 4:  Consistent in like the last 25 minutes of a plane ride when you

277
00:13:27,605 --> 00:13:30,445
Speaker 4:  land and you're kind of like, oh, I should finish that eventually. And then

278
00:13:30,445 --> 00:13:31,925
Speaker 4:  you never do. Like, that's Argyle. So

279
00:13:31,925 --> 00:13:35,045
Speaker 3:  The, okay, I've had this idea. Tell me if this is good about Ed or bad. We

280
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:38,325
Speaker 3:  review movies thing we do with The Verge and that's fine. And most movies

281
00:13:38,345 --> 00:13:41,965
Speaker 3:  are reviewed on like the tomato meter scale, like five stars. I have

282
00:13:42,075 --> 00:13:45,965
Speaker 3:  long thought. We need to build a product that just tells you where

283
00:13:46,105 --> 00:13:49,845
Speaker 3:  to watch a movie. Right. That's the actual ranking. It's like,

284
00:13:49,845 --> 00:13:51,245
Speaker 3:  should you spend money on this in The future? You mean

285
00:13:51,275 --> 00:13:52,085
Speaker 4:  Like physically in

286
00:13:52,085 --> 00:13:55,325
Speaker 3:  The world? You physically take your body to Argyle alone while your child

287
00:13:55,345 --> 00:13:59,285
Speaker 3:  is sleeping. No, see, answered right there. Yeah. Should you wait to pay

288
00:13:59,285 --> 00:14:02,365
Speaker 3:  for it when you can buy it or rent it in the, in the first window? No

289
00:14:03,865 --> 00:14:05,605
Speaker 3:  answer for, it's like a hard nose. What's

290
00:14:05,605 --> 00:14:08,605
Speaker 4:  At the bottom of that lit, like on airplane phone seat. Back five minutes.

291
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:11,725
Speaker 4:  Delta at a time at Starbucks. Yeah. That's the

292
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,885
Speaker 3:  In one minute clips on TikTok.

293
00:14:14,265 --> 00:14:15,725
Speaker 5:  Yes. Perfect.

294
00:14:15,725 --> 00:14:19,205
Speaker 3:  Right? Like, wouldn't this be like vastly more useful than Star Ratings

295
00:14:19,665 --> 00:14:23,445
Speaker 3:  if I was just like, this movie is good enough to watch on a JetBlue flight

296
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:27,725
Speaker 3:  where you're a little bit hungover. Like that's, that's

297
00:14:27,725 --> 00:14:29,245
Speaker 3:  all the, and we're gonna, yeah, we're gonna roll this out.

298
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:31,885
Speaker 4:  Okay. Wait. Now I wanna know, what is the movie that you've seen the most

299
00:14:31,985 --> 00:14:34,405
Speaker 4:  of exclusively in one minute? TikTok clips.

300
00:14:34,435 --> 00:14:38,085
Speaker 3:  Moneyball. Okay. The TikTok algorithm is like, you are gonna watch Moneyball

301
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:38,325
Speaker 3:  today.

302
00:14:39,185 --> 00:14:42,605
Speaker 5:  Is it, is it Sully? Is that what it's called? The one where Sully lands

303
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:44,365
Speaker 4:  The plane with the plane? I think it is Sully. Yeah. I

304
00:14:44,365 --> 00:14:45,765
Speaker 5:  Never learned that. Is because only

305
00:14:45,765 --> 00:14:48,205
Speaker 3:  See, that is a hard movie to watch in one minute. Clip

306
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:51,685
Speaker 5:  Only. Yeah. They only wanna show me like the plane landing. I get

307
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:52,005
Speaker 3:  Actually

308
00:14:52,355 --> 00:14:53,165
Speaker 5:  Over and over again.

309
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:57,125
Speaker 3:  Similarly, I get a lot of flight with Denzel Washington Ooh, which is a very

310
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,885
Speaker 3:  intense movie to watch in the form of one minute. TikTok. Yeah. Yeah.

311
00:15:01,105 --> 00:15:01,725
Speaker 3:  I'm just gonna call this,

312
00:15:01,795 --> 00:15:05,605
Speaker 4:  Mine is Real Steel, by the way. The one Hugh Jackman Flights Robots. Perfect.

313
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:05,965
Speaker 4:  TikTok.

314
00:15:06,165 --> 00:15:09,205
Speaker 3:  Can I call it just my, my favorite new podcast right now? There's a, a producer

315
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,405
Speaker 3:  explanation who has a podcast called the Irishman. I don't know If you ever

316
00:15:12,525 --> 00:15:16,285
Speaker 3:  finished this project, but he was watching all of the

317
00:15:16,405 --> 00:15:20,205
Speaker 3:  Irishman, which is a three and a half hour movie in one minute increments,

318
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:24,005
Speaker 3:  and then making a four minute podcast about that every single day.

319
00:15:24,325 --> 00:15:25,005
Speaker 4:  That's fantastic.

320
00:15:25,745 --> 00:15:29,565
Speaker 3:  And he, and he calls the mins and he is like, this Min was really hard to

321
00:15:29,565 --> 00:15:31,965
Speaker 3:  watch. And it like, he only watched a min,

322
00:15:34,505 --> 00:15:37,445
Speaker 3:  it, it is unclear whether he's gonna do Killers of the Flower Min.

323
00:15:38,765 --> 00:15:39,325
Speaker 5:  I want that. Yeah.

324
00:15:39,325 --> 00:15:42,405
Speaker 4:  It'll take six months to do that. It's very good. I love that. Okay. Are

325
00:15:42,405 --> 00:15:45,005
Speaker 4:  we, are we snake drafting or are we going back to the top?

326
00:15:45,635 --> 00:15:46,805
Speaker 3:  That snake drafting

327
00:15:46,805 --> 00:15:49,605
Speaker 4:  Snake Draft. Right. So I. Get to go again. Wait, I hate this. I know. This

328
00:15:49,605 --> 00:15:53,085
Speaker 4:  is great news for me. Let's see. I'm gonna go to the live category and I'm

329
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,885
Speaker 4:  gonna pick Amazon Prime Video Ooh, which has football, which is live So I

330
00:15:56,885 --> 00:15:57,005
Speaker 4:  know.

331
00:15:57,005 --> 00:15:57,525
Speaker 3:  That's good. Okay.

332
00:15:57,525 --> 00:15:59,885
Speaker 5:  Wait, are you doing the, with the 3 99?

333
00:16:00,355 --> 00:16:01,845
Speaker 3:  Yeah. You're doing ads or no ads? Yeah.

334
00:16:02,225 --> 00:16:02,725
Speaker 5:  Ads or No

335
00:16:02,725 --> 00:16:04,725
Speaker 4:  Ads. Ads. I'm fine with ads. Okay.

336
00:16:05,115 --> 00:16:06,725
Speaker 3:  It's 'cause you're, you're buying it for football,

337
00:16:06,905 --> 00:16:08,565
Speaker 4:  Not fine. The ads one

338
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:08,885
Speaker 3:  Mediocre

339
00:16:09,005 --> 00:16:11,805
Speaker 4:  Football on the fire tv where you turn on your TV and it's like, would you

340
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,565
Speaker 4:  like to watch some ads? No, thank you.

341
00:16:13,665 --> 00:16:15,205
Speaker 3:  But you're, you're taking it for football?

342
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:19,805
Speaker 4:  No, I get it because of football, but I'm taking it because frankly of Mr.

343
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:22,405
Speaker 4:  And Mrs. Smith, which I kicks and I would like that show. Okay. So you're,

344
00:16:22,405 --> 00:16:25,165
Speaker 3:  You're like backing into the category. Yeah. Because there's like one low

345
00:16:25,165 --> 00:16:27,605
Speaker 3:  rent a FC game a week. Yeah. And that's okay.

346
00:16:27,605 --> 00:16:31,285
Speaker 4:  Perfect. Al Michaels gets me this one. This is So I'm happy. There

347
00:16:31,285 --> 00:16:32,885
Speaker 3:  You go. I'll allow it. Thank

348
00:16:32,885 --> 00:16:36,725
Speaker 4:  You. And I now have the two that are never gonna die because they're funded

349
00:16:36,725 --> 00:16:38,645
Speaker 4:  by billionaires who don't care. It's perfect. That's fair.

350
00:16:38,645 --> 00:16:39,045
Speaker 3:  Fair enough.

351
00:16:39,075 --> 00:16:42,365
Speaker 4:  Okay. There's only one more of those left on this list. We'll come back to

352
00:16:42,405 --> 00:16:43,325
Speaker 4:  that. It's gonna be all right.

353
00:16:44,395 --> 00:16:46,285
Speaker 5:  Wait, how does the serpentine, does this mean that that

354
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:48,805
Speaker 4:  Means NELI eyes up. I hate this. And then you get to in a row. Okay.

355
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:50,965
Speaker 5:  Do you get ever any in a row?

356
00:16:51,225 --> 00:16:51,805
Speaker 3:  Huh? No.

357
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:54,005
Speaker 5:  You get none in a row. Yeah. So you really

358
00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:57,405
Speaker 4:  Do. We actually deliberately did this to screw over Eli. Okay. Yeah.

359
00:16:57,405 --> 00:16:58,405
Speaker 5:  Then it's all great. But

360
00:16:58,495 --> 00:16:59,325
Speaker 4:  Don't tell him we said that.

361
00:16:59,505 --> 00:17:01,125
Speaker 3:  I'm still gonna win this Draft. Yeah,

362
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:01,605
Speaker 4:  We'll

363
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:04,725
Speaker 3:  See. I'm gonna do it with my next pick. Okay. Which is the Disney bundle,

364
00:17:04,935 --> 00:17:06,005
Speaker 3:  which is unbeatable.

365
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:10,245
Speaker 5:  Wait, what is the Disney bundle? Is it Disney and ESPN and Hulu.

366
00:17:10,245 --> 00:17:10,525
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

367
00:17:11,065 --> 00:17:14,605
Speaker 3:  And in India. Hot Star. Okay. Where the cricket sands out there. Yeah.

368
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:15,925
Speaker 4:  Do we allow bundles?

369
00:17:16,485 --> 00:17:18,485
Speaker 5:  Hmm. I feel like bundles shouldn't be allowed this time.

370
00:17:18,755 --> 00:17:21,205
Speaker 3:  It's hard to buy Disney without Bob Iger coming to your house and be like,

371
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:23,605
Speaker 3:  you're gonna get Hulu. Just take it.

372
00:17:23,665 --> 00:17:26,805
Speaker 4:  That's actually sort of true. It is genuinely easier to get the bundle. Also,

373
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:30,005
Speaker 3:  Hulu is now integrated into the Disney app itself. you know, the app for

374
00:17:30,205 --> 00:17:32,085
Speaker 3:  families. It's like, here's the Handmaid's Sale. Yeah,

375
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:35,125
Speaker 5:  But what are you taking it for? Are you taking it for live or are you taking

376
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:35,685
Speaker 5:  it? Oh

377
00:17:35,685 --> 00:17:36,285
Speaker 4:  Yeah. What's your category?

378
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,245
Speaker 3:  We're taking it for bluey, like dead ahead blue.

379
00:17:39,245 --> 00:17:40,125
Speaker 5:  That's not a category.

380
00:17:40,355 --> 00:17:41,205
Speaker 4:  Yeah. What category do

381
00:17:41,445 --> 00:17:44,645
Speaker 3:  Remember? I just built like an insane home theater in artist. Can I talk

382
00:17:44,645 --> 00:17:48,205
Speaker 3:  about this? For Bluey? For Bluey. Bluey. Like what is watched in this thing

383
00:17:48,265 --> 00:17:49,085
Speaker 3:  is Bluey.

384
00:17:50,635 --> 00:17:51,645
Speaker 3:  It's very good. Okay.

385
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:52,565
Speaker 4:  All right. Yeah.

386
00:17:52,745 --> 00:17:56,605
Speaker 3:  So can I, max rolls up to the tv, huge TV on the wall,

387
00:17:56,825 --> 00:18:00,685
Speaker 3:  and she tries to scroll it, which is wild. 'cause it's bigger than

388
00:18:00,685 --> 00:18:03,245
Speaker 3:  her. Oh, wow. So she's just like, come on, what

389
00:18:03,245 --> 00:18:05,005
Speaker 4:  Does she think is gonna happen? She's,

390
00:18:05,005 --> 00:18:08,245
Speaker 3:  It'll scroll. She thinks I'm gonna use the remote and then I'll get what

391
00:18:08,245 --> 00:18:12,165
Speaker 3:  she wants. That's she's five. Yeah, that's good. Fair enough.

392
00:18:12,185 --> 00:18:16,045
Speaker 3:  By the way, Disney is, I believe at a 30 on the go. 90 scale.

393
00:18:16,465 --> 00:18:17,045
Speaker 4:  The whole bundle.

394
00:18:17,985 --> 00:18:20,805
Speaker 3:  Disney, I'm putting on all of Disney. Oh, just the company. Just company.

395
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:24,805
Speaker 3:  Okay. Company. And it, that's 10 for no one knows what's going

396
00:18:24,805 --> 00:18:28,045
Speaker 3:  on with Marvel. Okay. Just some weird stuff there.

397
00:18:28,785 --> 00:18:32,365
Speaker 3:  10 for no one. They've got a big debt load with Hulu and all this other stuff.

398
00:18:32,365 --> 00:18:36,205
Speaker 3:  They gotta do that. And then 10, because Max made me watch a

399
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:37,845
Speaker 3:  series of movies called The Descendants.

400
00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:39,925
Speaker 5:  They're

401
00:18:39,945 --> 00:18:43,885
Speaker 3:  So bad. It's the villains of Disney movies all have had

402
00:18:44,005 --> 00:18:47,685
Speaker 3:  children and then they dance, fight to bring their cities together.

403
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:48,165
Speaker 3:  No, that

404
00:18:48,165 --> 00:18:48,725
Speaker 5:  Sounds great.

405
00:18:48,945 --> 00:18:50,325
Speaker 3:  And they made three of these things.

406
00:18:50,325 --> 00:18:52,885
Speaker 4:  Wait, is that the one they made after the Hunger Games? And they were like,

407
00:18:52,885 --> 00:18:55,485
Speaker 4:  this is kind of like that. And then it was awful. And they were like, don't

408
00:18:55,485 --> 00:18:55,925
Speaker 4:  worry, we're gonna make

409
00:18:55,925 --> 00:18:56,845
Speaker 3:  A bunch. I don't wanna talk about it.

410
00:18:58,185 --> 00:19:00,285
Speaker 5:  That's the rest of this podcast. It's just,

411
00:19:00,635 --> 00:19:04,565
Speaker 3:  It's more hard pivoting to descendants. More good. We've been waiting

412
00:19:04,565 --> 00:19:08,485
Speaker 3:  for it. It's very bad. And that to me, I think moves Disney closer to death

413
00:19:08,485 --> 00:19:08,885
Speaker 3:  than not.

414
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:12,645
Speaker 4:  I do feel like you have to add like five or six more points for just like,

415
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:16,645
Speaker 4:  Bob Iger might literally just burn it down. Lay out. Yeah. You might be like,

416
00:19:16,645 --> 00:19:20,205
Speaker 4:  I'm actually retiring this time and just torch Disney. Yeah. Okay. Well,

417
00:19:20,205 --> 00:19:23,845
Speaker 4:  what category do you want that in? I believe it qualifies for

418
00:19:23,845 --> 00:19:26,845
Speaker 4:  everything you have available except for niche. Because not,

419
00:19:26,845 --> 00:19:29,525
Speaker 3:  So, yeah. It's definitely not niche. No. I'm gonna, I'm gonna put Disney.

420
00:19:29,825 --> 00:19:32,525
Speaker 3:  The, the, the bundle in awards. I think the awards category is the hardest

421
00:19:32,585 --> 00:19:34,245
Speaker 3:  to fill is my, my feeling.

422
00:19:34,515 --> 00:19:36,845
Speaker 4:  Hulu won an Oscar. You can have it there.

423
00:19:37,165 --> 00:19:39,885
Speaker 3:  I believe Disney, the Disney Corporation has not

424
00:19:39,885 --> 00:19:40,965
Speaker 4:  Disney Plus, though.

425
00:19:42,405 --> 00:19:43,205
Speaker 3:  I don't think any Disney

426
00:19:43,275 --> 00:19:45,845
Speaker 4:  Plus originals are tearing it up at the award shows. Right.

427
00:19:46,465 --> 00:19:47,045
Speaker 3:  Oh, come on.

428
00:19:47,195 --> 00:19:50,245
Speaker 4:  High school. Musical. The musical, the series, the Crushing it. Give

429
00:19:50,245 --> 00:19:50,965
Speaker 3:  It a sound Design

430
00:19:52,695 --> 00:19:53,245
Speaker 3:  fan's not like

431
00:19:53,245 --> 00:19:55,565
Speaker 4:  Candy. That's probably true. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Alex, you get two picks

432
00:19:55,565 --> 00:19:55,925
Speaker 4:  now. Okay.

433
00:19:55,925 --> 00:19:59,765
Speaker 5:  I get two picks. I've done 4K. Correct. So, I need cheap.

434
00:20:00,185 --> 00:20:04,085
Speaker 5:  So for cheap, I'm gonna go Peacock. Okay. Because they, they got the

435
00:20:04,085 --> 00:20:06,965
Speaker 5:  live stuff. Yep. You could watch the State of the Union. If, you wanted to

436
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:09,805
Speaker 5:  on Peacock, you got the, the Olympics are coming and stuff like that.

437
00:20:09,805 --> 00:20:11,605
Speaker 4:  That's true. It's actually a good year to have Peacock

438
00:20:11,605 --> 00:20:15,085
Speaker 5:  And it's like, it's mad cheap. Okay. It is very affordable, but for,

439
00:20:15,355 --> 00:20:18,485
Speaker 4:  It's also where I watch Parks and Recreation, so it's very important to my

440
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:18,645
Speaker 4:  life.

441
00:20:18,835 --> 00:20:22,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I know. I, it was, this was, again, I knew you had picked it last year.

442
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:23,005

Speaker 4:  It was gonna be my next pick. You're welcome. That was right there. Thank

Speaker 5:  I got you. And then Ooh, what are the other categories again?

446
00:20:29,505 --> 00:20:32,565
Speaker 4:  You still have awards? Live Niche, and wild card.

447
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,045
Speaker 5:  See, those are also easy to fill. I feel like

448
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:38,165
Speaker 4:  One substantially less so. Mm.

449
00:20:38,385 --> 00:20:41,285
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna save awards for last. I've, I've got a, I've got a good, I've got

450
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:45,045
Speaker 5:  one in the pocket for awards. Okay. But I'm gonna go niche.

451
00:20:45,235 --> 00:20:48,245
Speaker 5:  Okay. This time I'm gonna go crunchy Roll Ooh.

452
00:20:49,355 --> 00:20:50,885
Speaker 3:  Wait, did you rank your last one?

453
00:20:51,265 --> 00:20:55,245
Speaker 5:  Oh, no, I have to rank it. You're right, you're right. Peacock. Ooh. I think

454
00:20:55,245 --> 00:20:58,525
Speaker 5:  that's like a, like a 2020.

455
00:20:58,755 --> 00:20:59,045
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

456
00:20:59,265 --> 00:20:59,645
Speaker 5:  You think

457
00:20:59,645 --> 00:21:01,925
Speaker 4:  Netflix is more likely to die than Peacock?

458
00:21:02,035 --> 00:21:05,125
Speaker 3:  Yeah. You think Disney is more likely to die in Peacock?

459
00:21:05,835 --> 00:21:09,405
Speaker 3:  Peacock is in danger of just directly being forgotten about. Yeah.

460
00:21:09,665 --> 00:21:10,605
Speaker 5:  But it's, it's growing

461
00:21:10,795 --> 00:21:13,525
Speaker 3:  Just straight up. The Roberts family, they owned this. Comcast is like, we

462
00:21:13,525 --> 00:21:15,725
Speaker 3:  did Peacock. Who named this? Yeah.

463
00:21:15,945 --> 00:21:18,845
Speaker 5:  Nobody knows it exists, but it's still like there. I think it's like the

464
00:21:18,935 --> 00:21:22,805
Speaker 5:  sixth most subscribed like platform right

465
00:21:22,805 --> 00:21:26,765
Speaker 5:  now for, or Streaming platforms. So like, people are doing it. Mainly it's

466
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:30,645
Speaker 5:  David and other people who wanna watch Parks and Rec. Yeah. And so, so

467
00:21:30,645 --> 00:21:34,245
Speaker 5:  yeah. And I feel like Parks and Rec is really gonna like, let us survive

468
00:21:34,345 --> 00:21:35,965
Speaker 5:  in a way that Netflix can't 'cause Netflix Doesn

469
00:21:35,965 --> 00:21:38,365
Speaker 3:  Own it. Just a direct, direct subscription to Parks and Rec. Yeah.

470
00:21:38,915 --> 00:21:39,805
Speaker 5:  Yeah. First

471
00:21:39,805 --> 00:21:43,085
Speaker 4:  Of all, I would pay for that for the rest of my life. Same. Yeah. But also

472
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:46,805
Speaker 4:  Netflix has Suits. N Eli's favorite show on television.

473
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:48,285
Speaker 3:  I start hissing at you.

474
00:21:50,005 --> 00:21:52,165
Speaker 3:  I don Dunno if I've told this story on a podcast. I have a niece, nephew,

475
00:21:52,165 --> 00:21:54,965
Speaker 3:  they're in college, they're doing great. And they, they hit their first exams

476
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:58,765
Speaker 3:  in their freshman year of college. And my niece, who wants to be a, she wants

477
00:21:58,765 --> 00:22:02,645
Speaker 3:  to do forensics, so she's a chem major. She texted me and said,

478
00:22:02,825 --> 00:22:06,805
Speaker 3:  what's law school like? Because she had encountered her first like

479
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:10,565
Speaker 3:  chem exams. And I was like, what is going on here? Like, this is a hard,

480
00:22:10,615 --> 00:22:13,725
Speaker 3:  don't go to law school, first of all, just like blanket advice. And she's

481
00:22:13,725 --> 00:22:16,765
Speaker 3:  like, well, I've been watching a lot of suits. And I was like, this is a

482
00:22:16,765 --> 00:22:20,325
Speaker 3:  danger to America. Like this dumb show.

483
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:23,685
Speaker 3:  But wait, isn't is like single-handedly taking women outta stem.

484
00:22:24,425 --> 00:22:28,245
Speaker 5:  The point of the show is that the guy doesn't go to law school. Yeah.

485
00:22:28,585 --> 00:22:30,325
Speaker 5:  So why would you wanna go to law school? That's a good school

486
00:22:30,525 --> 00:22:32,885
Speaker 3:  Watching point. The point of the show don't to is also that it rots your

487
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,445
Speaker 3:  brain and soul with every passing minute.

488
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:37,965
Speaker 3:  Sorry, I just like suits. I don't have to True.

489
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:39,325
Speaker 5:  You love it.

490
00:22:39,635 --> 00:22:41,725
Speaker 3:  I've watched several episodes of the show and I, the other thing

491
00:22:41,725 --> 00:22:43,965
Speaker 4:  Everybody should know is NELI auditioned for Suits. I didn't

492
00:22:43,965 --> 00:22:47,125
Speaker 3:  Get it. We're the Meghan Markle role. Actually, actually, it was a weird

493
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:50,525
Speaker 3:  callback. I could see, can you fit in this dress? And I was like, not at

494
00:22:50,525 --> 00:22:50,645
Speaker 3:  all.

495
00:22:52,275 --> 00:22:52,845
Speaker 5:  Just a little.

496
00:22:53,385 --> 00:22:54,605
Speaker 3:  All right. So that was, yeah.

497
00:22:54,765 --> 00:22:55,085
Speaker 5:  I, all right.

498
00:22:55,105 --> 00:22:57,005
Speaker 3:  So we like hard diverged in

499
00:22:57,005 --> 00:22:58,525
Speaker 5:  This space. Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. So

500
00:22:58,525 --> 00:23:01,965
Speaker 3:  Peacock you think is close, less close to death than Netflix. Yeah.

501
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:05,645
Speaker 5:  Because Peacock is an entertainment company. Like, like I, I,

502
00:23:05,925 --> 00:23:09,765
Speaker 5:  I fully believe that companies that are built on entertainment are going

503
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:13,445
Speaker 5:  to have their Streaming services probably survive longer than the companies

504
00:23:13,445 --> 00:23:17,125
Speaker 5:  who are built around tech. Because the tech companies are

505
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:21,085
Speaker 5:  trying to make art like technology. Yeah. And that's just,

506
00:23:21,755 --> 00:23:24,645
Speaker 5:  there's a lot of similarities between those two. But there's a lot of things

507
00:23:24,645 --> 00:23:25,525
Speaker 5:  that are not

508
00:23:25,525 --> 00:23:28,605
Speaker 3:  Similar. Yeah. Netflix is like, can we algorithmically recreate a movie?

509
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:32,165
Speaker 5:  Right. And that's dumb. Yeah. Whereas like, peacock's, like, can we

510
00:23:32,675 --> 00:23:36,365
Speaker 5:  make poker face? And that's cool. I mean, four people watched it.

511
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:39,085
Speaker 5:  I was one of them. But I bet a bunch of people in the crowd. It's very good

512
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,805
Speaker 5:  though. Yeah. Poker face was great. That's the only one that I hear Anybody

513
00:23:41,805 --> 00:23:42,125
Speaker 5:  know for

514
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,925
Speaker 3:  The audience in the car, there was dead silence from the crowd.

515
00:23:46,145 --> 00:23:46,365
Speaker 3:  Sh,

516
00:23:47,785 --> 00:23:51,045
Speaker 5:  We can put that in post. We can put that in post. Yeah. Standing Ovation.

517
00:23:51,045 --> 00:23:51,725
Speaker 5:  Believe in Peacock.

518
00:23:52,185 --> 00:23:54,285
Speaker 3:  All right. Crunchy roll. Go. 90 Scale Crunchy

519
00:23:54,285 --> 00:23:58,125
Speaker 5:  Roll. Ooh. That one's harder because they, they just are like, they're killing

520
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:02,085
Speaker 5:  off a lot of stuff over there. Right. Every time Lov like notices, he

521
00:24:02,085 --> 00:24:03,445
Speaker 5:  owns a company. He's like,

522
00:24:04,425 --> 00:24:06,245
Speaker 3:  No, crunch Roll is Sony. That's the anime.

523
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:07,365
Speaker 5:  Is it owned by Sony? Sony.

524
00:24:07,475 --> 00:24:10,685
Speaker 3:  Sony, okay. So, and Sony merged it with a company. This is a real name of

525
00:24:10,685 --> 00:24:12,125
Speaker 3:  a company. Fun animation.

526
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:14,245
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah. Fun animation's from my town.

527
00:24:14,405 --> 00:24:15,885
Speaker 3:  Super cool. And then they, can you

528
00:24:15,885 --> 00:24:18,005
Speaker 4:  Imagine the meeting where they had to decide whether to keep crunchy roll

529
00:24:18,005 --> 00:24:18,685
Speaker 4:  or fun animation?

530
00:24:19,995 --> 00:24:23,205
Speaker 3:  Very good. So yeah, Sony owns both of them. They merged 'em together. They

531
00:24:23,205 --> 00:24:27,045
Speaker 3:  got rid of the, the digital purchases. That was a big out Outroar

532
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:28,045
Speaker 3:  one of those words. So

533
00:24:28,045 --> 00:24:31,205
Speaker 5:  Crunchy roll. but it, it, they're just on max then they just like have a

534
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:31,805
Speaker 5:  license. Yeah.

535
00:24:31,955 --> 00:24:33,045
Speaker 3:  They're doing the distribution thing.

536
00:24:33,115 --> 00:24:37,005
Speaker 5:  Okay. Well Ooh that, that changes it a little on the Go 90 scale, right?

537
00:24:37,345 --> 00:24:38,845
Speaker 5:  If there doesn't have the specter. Well,

538
00:24:38,845 --> 00:24:42,085
Speaker 3:  It depends on how much you think touching HBO Max

539
00:24:42,235 --> 00:24:46,125
Speaker 3:  immediately brings you closer to death. Like If, you acknowledge HBO

540
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:47,445
Speaker 3:  Max. Like, are you closer to death?

541
00:24:47,465 --> 00:24:51,365
Speaker 5:  That's true. That's true. So, so 10 Points, because it was on HBO max.

542
00:24:51,505 --> 00:24:54,885
Speaker 5:  So it's been like, acknowledged by that 10 points because it's owned by Sony.

543
00:24:54,885 --> 00:24:58,365
Speaker 5:  And Sony also often forgets it owns things. And then

544
00:24:59,105 --> 00:25:03,045
Speaker 5:  10 points for the Weeps. I'm a weep. I'm sorry. I, I hope

545
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:03,725
Speaker 5:  that's not a whole So

546
00:25:03,725 --> 00:25:05,285
Speaker 3:  You, you're, you're you're coming to 40?

547
00:25:05,785 --> 00:25:09,085
Speaker 5:  No, I'm at 30. That's just 30. 30. Okay. So it's a 30. It's not 30.

548
00:25:09,145 --> 00:25:12,645
Speaker 4:  So still less likely to die than Netflix. Yeah, exactly. This all makes perfect

549
00:25:12,735 --> 00:25:14,445
Speaker 3:  Enemy fans are hardcore. Yeah, they

550
00:25:14,445 --> 00:25:15,085
Speaker 5:  Are hardcore.

551
00:25:15,435 --> 00:25:18,845
Speaker 3:  Sure. Like you're, we just had that, we just had the president of Crunch

552
00:25:18,845 --> 00:25:22,325
Speaker 3:  Roll and Decoder, and he was like, we're ready to go. He was, he was very

553
00:25:22,325 --> 00:25:22,925
Speaker 3:  excited about anime.

554
00:25:22,925 --> 00:25:26,445
Speaker 5:  Like that, that that thing started for just like people who wanted a pirate,

555
00:25:26,585 --> 00:25:30,405
Speaker 5:  an anime Yeah. From overseas. And then they were like, what if we just make

556
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:31,045
Speaker 5:  ourselves legit?

557
00:25:31,045 --> 00:25:31,885
Speaker 3:  If we sold, sold it to them instead.

558
00:25:32,345 --> 00:25:35,765
Speaker 5:  And, and they did. And it's like, cool. That's awesome. I support you. Crunchy

00:25:35,765 --> 00:25:35,925

Speaker 3:  the show. Max one really good. And then one woman, this is a real

583
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,885
Speaker 3:  thing. This is reporting. You cannot cancel me for this. This is a quote.

586
00:26:48,835 --> 00:26:52,725
Speaker 3:  This is a true thing that was said to us. And then I just backed away from

00:26:52,725 --> 00:26:56,605
Speaker 3:  this situation. one of them said to us, the ladies are taking the

588
00:26:56,605 --> 00:26:59,525
Speaker 3:  Paramount one because the logo is prettier Ooh.

589
00:27:00,825 --> 00:27:01,045
Speaker 5:  See,

590
00:27:01,445 --> 00:27:03,845
Speaker 3:  I didn't say that. I didn't make that up. Someone else said that to me. I'm

591
00:27:03,845 --> 00:27:07,045
Speaker 3:  just reporting to you what was said. And I guarantee you this was said to

592
00:27:07,045 --> 00:27:10,925
Speaker 3:  us just to even out the idea that everyone was taking the HBO

593
00:27:10,925 --> 00:27:11,125
Speaker 3:  max.

594
00:27:11,425 --> 00:27:14,965
Speaker 4:  Yes. Ooh. 'cause the first person was like, oh yeah, it's the max ones. And

595
00:27:14,965 --> 00:27:17,045
Speaker 4:  then was like, well, no. I mean, it's like, it's fine. They're both great.

596
00:27:17,045 --> 00:27:19,685
Speaker 4:  It's like 50 50. Don't worry, even worry about it. And then there was somebody

597
00:27:19,685 --> 00:27:21,165
Speaker 4:  two seats down who was like, what

598
00:27:21,165 --> 00:27:24,965
Speaker 3:  If I make some shit up about the logo being right here? That was like very

599
00:27:24,965 --> 00:27:28,885
Speaker 3:  much how this was going. Anyway, I, I took the HBO max bag to give it to

600
00:27:28,885 --> 00:27:32,845
Speaker 3:  my daughter Max, and then promptly forgot it, so. Aw, that's fine. Oh, she'll

601
00:27:32,845 --> 00:27:33,485
Speaker 3:  be fine. She knows.

602
00:27:34,925 --> 00:27:35,365
Speaker 5:  I hope so.

603
00:27:36,285 --> 00:27:40,245
Speaker 3:  HBO max, by the way, also Ed in 80 on the go 90 scale of

604
00:27:40,315 --> 00:27:41,245
Speaker 3:  Doom Streaming Services.

605
00:27:41,865 --> 00:27:44,405
Speaker 5:  How do you, how do you measure that? How do you get those points?

606
00:27:45,435 --> 00:27:48,605
Speaker 3:  Well, I don't think you have to add 'em up that that 80 is a real vibe. Yeah.

607
00:27:48,605 --> 00:27:51,845
Speaker 3:  That's just the looming presence of David's LOV and his decision making.

608
00:27:51,945 --> 00:27:52,165
Speaker 3:  He

609
00:27:52,165 --> 00:27:53,645
Speaker 5:  Just looks over and he's like, what's that? She

610
00:27:54,325 --> 00:27:58,125
Speaker 3:  HBO Max, as you know, a product of a doomed merger

611
00:27:58,155 --> 00:28:01,765
Speaker 3:  with at and t in which at and t convinced a federal judge

612
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:05,645
Speaker 3:  that this was quote, a vision deal. And that the vision was they would put

613
00:28:05,735 --> 00:28:09,405
Speaker 3:  short versions of Game of Thrones on Android phones. Oh

614
00:28:09,475 --> 00:28:09,765
Speaker 3:  yeah.

615
00:28:10,675 --> 00:28:11,245
Speaker 5:  That would've

616
00:28:11,245 --> 00:28:14,685
Speaker 3:  Ruled. And our nation's justice system looked at this and was like, sick.

617
00:28:15,835 --> 00:28:17,085
Speaker 5:  Yeah. 'cause it would've been cool.

618
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,365
Speaker 3:  It's like a real thing that

619
00:28:18,565 --> 00:28:21,005
Speaker 4:  Happened. Do you ever say a sentence out loud and be like, that can't possibly

620
00:28:21,005 --> 00:28:23,445
Speaker 4:  be true. Like there's no way. That thing I just said is real.

621
00:28:23,865 --> 00:28:27,725
Speaker 3:  It super happened. They're like, the division is, we're gonna preload

622
00:28:27,735 --> 00:28:30,485
Speaker 3:  stuff on mid-range Android phones, and it's gonna be Game of Throne slips.

623
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:34,885
Speaker 3:  That didn't pan out, as many of you may have noticed at all.

624
00:28:34,885 --> 00:28:38,845
Speaker 3:  Fall apart. They've got a enormous amount of debt. And what they

625
00:28:38,845 --> 00:28:42,725
Speaker 3:  have is a lot of at and t customers who can't quit HBO

626
00:28:42,725 --> 00:28:46,645
Speaker 3:  Max. I'm one of these people. I'm grandfathered into an HBO Max plan.

627
00:28:46,985 --> 00:28:50,405
Speaker 3:  And So I cannot put this in the 4K category. Ah, because

628
00:28:51,225 --> 00:28:55,165
Speaker 3:  my at and t account no longer knows about HBO Max and I can't

629
00:28:55,165 --> 00:28:58,805
Speaker 3:  leave whatever version of the service I'm currently subscribed to,

630
00:28:58,975 --> 00:29:00,565
Speaker 3:  which no longer has 4K.

631
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:02,125
Speaker 4:  That sounds right. This

632
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:05,565
Speaker 3:  Is com These are some of the, the, the biggest, most sophisticated

633
00:29:05,965 --> 00:29:09,325
Speaker 3:  companies in our country. And they're like, our database forgot about you,

634
00:29:10,305 --> 00:29:13,125
Speaker 4:  But they'll keep charging You. Don't worry about that. Yeah. They will keep

635
00:29:13,205 --> 00:29:15,645
Speaker 3:  Charging you. They're definitely gonna keep charging me. So. I believe. Yeah.

636
00:29:15,645 --> 00:29:16,605
Speaker 3:  The Wild Card. Would

637
00:29:16,605 --> 00:29:18,845
Speaker 5:  The 4K have even been good though, coming from Max?

638
00:29:19,605 --> 00:29:19,725
Speaker 3:  I,

639
00:29:19,745 --> 00:29:20,965
Speaker 5:  Excuse me. HBO Max?

640
00:29:21,865 --> 00:29:23,165
Speaker 3:  No, no, no, no, no. Definitely

641
00:29:23,165 --> 00:29:24,125
Speaker 5:  Not. It would've been bad.

642
00:29:24,485 --> 00:29:28,085
Speaker 3:  I watched what's the, what's the one where they fight, let them fight.

643
00:29:28,805 --> 00:29:29,365
Speaker 3:  Godzilla.

644
00:29:29,565 --> 00:29:30,125
Speaker 5:  Godzilla.

645
00:29:31,465 --> 00:29:35,285
Speaker 3:  That's how my brain works. I'd watched that in their version of Atmos

646
00:29:35,305 --> 00:29:39,045
Speaker 3:  and Vision. Yeah. And it was like, what if we do this at two bits per second?

647
00:29:39,355 --> 00:29:42,925
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It was just like a series of shapes and colors and noises. you know.

648
00:29:43,165 --> 00:29:46,285
Speaker 3:  Beautiful. Like a baby toy was just like happening. And then the one guy

649
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,885
Speaker 3:  was like, let them fight. It's good. That's how you wanna experience that.

650
00:29:49,035 --> 00:29:52,245
Speaker 4:  Love that. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. I can't believe no one has picked YouTube

651
00:29:52,245 --> 00:29:55,205
Speaker 4:  yet. I feel obligated to pick YouTube, which I'm YouTube. Wait,

652
00:29:55,205 --> 00:29:56,765
Speaker 3:  YouTube TV or YouTube Premium? Well, So,

653
00:29:56,765 --> 00:30:00,605
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna put YouTube in cheap. So neither. Oh, I'm getting you full.

654
00:30:00,785 --> 00:30:04,645
Speaker 4:  I'm getting YouTube with ads. All the ads, like every single ad you can imagine.

655
00:30:04,705 --> 00:30:04,965
Speaker 4:  I'm just

656
00:30:05,285 --> 00:30:07,005
Speaker 3:  Watching. That is the worst choice on this list I'm gonna watch. I love it.

657
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:08,965
Speaker 3:  YouTube with ads is the worst choice on this list.

658
00:30:09,865 --> 00:30:13,005
Speaker 5:  No, I disagree. We'll see, that's a good choice. That's, that's how I watch

659
00:30:13,005 --> 00:30:13,445
Speaker 5:  YouTube now

660
00:30:13,585 --> 00:30:16,925
Speaker 4:  I'm logged in So I get recommendations. All right. But I have to watch

661
00:30:17,425 --> 00:30:21,125
Speaker 4:  all the ads. I get mad at people who have ads now on YouTube.

662
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:23,885
Speaker 4:  That's the thing that has happened to me recently. Yeah. But I, I'll get

663
00:30:23,885 --> 00:30:26,045
Speaker 4:  over it. Win the Draft. I will over, I think bringing

664
00:30:26,045 --> 00:30:26,805
Speaker 3:  Is the best deal in Streaming.

665
00:30:27,065 --> 00:30:29,325
Speaker 4:  Yes, I agree with that. Just, but don don't get to have it.

666
00:30:29,505 --> 00:30:30,165
Speaker 3:  You're going ads.

667
00:30:30,345 --> 00:30:31,565
Speaker 4:  I'm going, I'm going YouTube.

668
00:30:31,885 --> 00:30:34,885
Speaker 3:  You're just going straight American cheese. It's, yeah. Other cheeses are

669
00:30:34,885 --> 00:30:37,325
Speaker 3:  available, but just Nope. Slices in the mouth. All right.

670
00:30:37,325 --> 00:30:40,165
Speaker 4:  Just want it. Just give it to me. Okay. So that's the end of round three.

671
00:30:40,165 --> 00:30:43,685
Speaker 4:  YouTube is a zero on the go. 90 scale. Yeah. Yeah, it's fine. Feel very good

672
00:30:43,685 --> 00:30:43,805
Speaker 4:  about

673
00:30:43,805 --> 00:30:46,285
Speaker 3:  That. It's the only, it's the only part of Google that feels like a enough

674
00:30:46,285 --> 00:30:46,605
Speaker 3:  what us

675
00:30:46,605 --> 00:30:49,045
Speaker 4:  Doing. It might be the only thing left on the internet at the end of all

676
00:30:49,045 --> 00:30:50,485
Speaker 4:  of this. Like it's just

00:31:50,805 --> 00:31:54,505
Speaker 1:  say goodbye to the org chart. It's time to accomplish those big ideas that

681
00:31:54,505 --> 00:31:58,425
Speaker 1:  would be impossible to achieve alone. Because individuals were great, but

686
00:32:17,925 --> 00:32:21,335
Speaker 4:  Alex so far has Peacock Netflix and Crunchy roll. Yeah.

687
00:32:21,685 --> 00:32:25,415
Speaker 4:  NELI has TikTok, the Disney bundle. And Max I have YouTube

688
00:32:25,415 --> 00:32:29,175
Speaker 4:  Apple TV and Prime Video. I think it's very clear who is

689
00:32:29,175 --> 00:32:33,135
Speaker 4:  currently in third place, but we'll leave that alone for now. I'm in

690
00:32:33,135 --> 00:32:33,575
Speaker 4:  first. Wow.

691
00:32:35,045 --> 00:32:36,735
Speaker 3:  Just wait. Just wait. Yeah,

692
00:32:36,735 --> 00:32:40,725
Speaker 4:  We're doing fine. I'm crush. Okay. So for round four, I get to go again,

693
00:32:40,935 --> 00:32:43,045
Speaker 4:  which I am not prepared for. What do

694
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:43,925
Speaker 5:  You what What are your, are your

695
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:46,765
Speaker 3:  Leftovers? I don't, haven't you been cheating this whole time? No. Is this

696
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:49,485
Speaker 3:  just like, you like hustling us? You're like, I don't know how to play pool.

697
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:52,805
Speaker 5:  He's just moving everything around. He is giving himself Netflix, giving

698
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:53,565
Speaker 5:  himself Netflix. I did

699
00:32:53,565 --> 00:32:57,245
Speaker 4:  Briefly give NELI two of my picks, so that was confusing. You're doing great.

700
00:32:57,505 --> 00:33:00,405
Speaker 4:  So I have 4K Niche and wild card left.

701
00:33:00,595 --> 00:33:00,885
Speaker 5:  Okay.

702
00:33:01,345 --> 00:33:01,965
Speaker 4:  And I think

703
00:33:03,765 --> 00:33:07,205
Speaker 4:  I can't do any of the 4K ones I know of anymore. So that's bad.

704
00:33:07,595 --> 00:33:10,725
Speaker 4:  Does Tuby count as niche? What do we think? No,

705
00:33:11,105 --> 00:33:13,405
Speaker 3:  No. Two Tuby is like what happens when you turn on?

706
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:15,045
Speaker 4:  I got a Yes from the audience. That's

707
00:33:15,045 --> 00:33:16,245
Speaker 3:  Just, you know, tuby.

708
00:33:17,755 --> 00:33:21,565
Speaker 3:  Well, tuby is like, like mainstream free. Yeah. Ad

709
00:33:21,565 --> 00:33:23,045
Speaker 3:  supported. It's just Alex loves these things.

710
00:33:23,075 --> 00:33:26,085
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's just free ad supported television. It's got all of the stuff

711
00:33:26,745 --> 00:33:29,405
Speaker 4:  You just made that sound very boring and very niche. That's kind of my point.

712
00:33:29,545 --> 00:33:29,765
Speaker 4:  No,

713
00:33:29,765 --> 00:33:33,565
Speaker 5:  No, because it's got you. Well, no way I can describe it as gonna

714
00:33:33,565 --> 00:33:34,165
Speaker 5:  support. Well,

715
00:33:34,165 --> 00:33:35,445
Speaker 3:  I'm I'm just saying like, If, you damn

716
00:33:35,445 --> 00:33:35,885
Speaker 4:  It. No,

717
00:33:35,885 --> 00:33:38,245
Speaker 3:  You're right. If you're one of these boomers and you get off TikTok, you,

718
00:33:38,245 --> 00:33:41,245
Speaker 3:  you on your eight hours of TikTok in the day Yeah. And you go turn on your,

719
00:33:41,305 --> 00:33:45,245
Speaker 3:  the cheapest TV that you bought at at Best Buy, you're watching Tuby. Like

720
00:33:45,245 --> 00:33:46,085
Speaker 3:  it's just happening to you.

721
00:33:46,085 --> 00:33:47,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah, that is probably true.

722
00:33:47,765 --> 00:33:50,685
Speaker 3:  I don't mean that to denigrate If. you choose Pluto, TikTok riddled boomers

723
00:33:50,685 --> 00:33:54,245
Speaker 3:  that populate the middle of the country. I am one of them. I mean to say

724
00:33:54,245 --> 00:33:57,285
Speaker 3:  that that is a thing that happens on TVs by default and that makes it not

725
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:57,605
Speaker 3:  mainstream.

726
00:33:57,915 --> 00:34:01,125
Speaker 4:  Fair enough. All right, well then I won't take that. I will take Criterion

727
00:34:01,585 --> 00:34:03,405
Speaker 3:  In. Yeah, that's, see, that's, that's much more

728
00:34:03,405 --> 00:34:06,765
Speaker 4:  Appropriate. Yeah, that feels right. Yeah. Criterion is like, I don't know,

729
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:10,405
Speaker 4:  it's like a in the twenties on the scale, I would say. Yeah. Like I want

730
00:34:10,405 --> 00:34:12,845
Speaker 4:  it to continue to exist and so do lots of people.

731
00:34:13,245 --> 00:34:14,565
Speaker 5:  I think Criterion wants it to

732
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:19,005
Speaker 4:  Continue to exist, but maybe all of Criterion will not exist forever.

733
00:34:19,585 --> 00:34:23,325
Speaker 5:  No, it feels pretty sustainable. Yeah. There was a really great story recently

734
00:34:23,325 --> 00:34:27,045
Speaker 5:  about just kind of how sustainable it is and its whole business. but it isn't

735
00:34:27,045 --> 00:34:29,765
Speaker 3:  Sustainability like James Cameron wants it to exist.

736
00:34:30,265 --> 00:34:30,925
Speaker 4:  Yes. Yeah. That

737
00:34:30,925 --> 00:34:32,525
Speaker 5:  Therefore it will exist. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

738
00:34:32,525 --> 00:34:32,885
Speaker 3:  That's fair.

739
00:34:33,395 --> 00:34:36,485
Speaker 4:  It's like the letterbox app where like, it'll be fine because Martin Scorsese

740
00:34:36,635 --> 00:34:39,965
Speaker 4:  uses it. So like push comes to shove, it's gonna be all right. All right.

741
00:34:39,965 --> 00:34:43,885
Speaker 4:  So I'm taking a criterion. That's my pick. NELI, you're up, you have

742
00:34:43,885 --> 00:34:47,165
Speaker 4:  three categories remaining. You have 4K live and each, those are your three

743
00:34:47,555 --> 00:34:48,045
Speaker 4:  YouTube

744
00:34:48,185 --> 00:34:51,685
Speaker 3:  TV with Sunday Ticket. I don't think you understand that. I'm just

745
00:34:51,685 --> 00:34:55,365
Speaker 3:  recapitulating my Draft that already won this thing. And

746
00:34:55,995 --> 00:34:58,685
Speaker 3:  YouTube nerds are like, what do I do with Discovery? Plus? Like, I'm just

747
00:34:58,685 --> 00:35:01,845
Speaker 3:  like straight America. but it didn't win. I picked. Huh?

748
00:35:01,985 --> 00:35:02,605
Speaker 5:  You didn't win.

749
00:35:03,075 --> 00:35:04,365
Speaker 4:  Well, yeah, you objectively did.

750
00:35:04,385 --> 00:35:08,085
Speaker 5:  In fact, I won. It's so, I'm, I'm just coming in again. I'm just saying

751
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:11,485
Speaker 3:  Alex, I like to think that we have a good relationship in, in this situation.

752
00:35:11,605 --> 00:35:14,125
Speaker 3:  I would like to just directly gaslight you and say that I won.

753
00:35:17,265 --> 00:35:18,925
Speaker 5:  All right. What are you gonna do? No, you chose YouTube

754
00:35:18,925 --> 00:35:22,445
Speaker 3:  YouTube TV Sunday Ticket is a straight zero. Yeah. Yeah. Like you can't,

755
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:26,325
Speaker 3:  you're fighting the service that delivers Taylor Swift and Travis Kel. Millions

756
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:29,485
Speaker 3:  of Americans every week. Like you're, it's fine. Yeah. It is the fastest

757
00:35:29,485 --> 00:35:33,325
Speaker 3:  growing cable service in America. It has the most cha it has the most stuff.

758
00:35:33,525 --> 00:35:37,245
Speaker 3:  'cause it's a cable service and it has the, the full backing of our

759
00:35:37,245 --> 00:35:39,525
Speaker 3:  nation's military slash LI

760
00:35:39,525 --> 00:35:42,125
Speaker 4:  Mean, it bought a decade of football, which means it bought a decade of existing.

761
00:35:42,155 --> 00:35:42,805
Speaker 4:  Yeah, yeah.

762
00:35:42,905 --> 00:35:46,205
Speaker 5:  You, you did So for 10 years. It's a zero, 11

763
00:35:46,215 --> 00:35:49,565
Speaker 3:  Years or un or un un until they break up. But yeah, from the reports I've

764
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:52,285
Speaker 3:  read, it suggests that he's in Singapore right now. So, I think think that

765
00:35:52,285 --> 00:35:54,445
Speaker 3:  that's true and that, you know, they both discuss taking the next step.

766
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,325
Speaker 3:  What do you think? I'm not following this m like crazy. I'm

767
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:01,365
Speaker 5:  Culture vibe. I get it.

768
00:36:01,515 --> 00:36:04,965
Speaker 4:  Alright, so that's yours. And, and I want you to know that I'm giving you

769
00:36:04,965 --> 00:36:07,805
Speaker 4:  YouTube tv because it is a separate product from YouTube.

770
00:36:08,265 --> 00:36:08,485
Speaker 3:  Yes.

771
00:36:08,705 --> 00:36:11,685
Speaker 4:  But If, you now try to just be like YouTube tv, but not Sunday. Take it.

772
00:36:11,705 --> 00:36:13,645
Speaker 4:  No. Yeah. NELI. No,

773
00:36:13,765 --> 00:36:16,045
Speaker 3:  I don't, I don't dunno what you're arguing with or who you're arguing with.

774
00:36:16,105 --> 00:36:16,725
Speaker 3:  But you saw I,

775
00:36:17,045 --> 00:36:18,285
Speaker 4:  I have played these games with you before.

776
00:36:20,025 --> 00:36:22,005
Speaker 3:  Yes. And I guess I'm now directly gaslighting.

777
00:36:22,485 --> 00:36:24,965
Speaker 4:  There we go. Okay. Alex, you're up. You get two now.

778
00:36:25,075 --> 00:36:28,125
Speaker 5:  Okay. I get two. I get to go two in a row. You get two picks. Wow. What,

779
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:29,245
Speaker 5:  what's left for me? How do

780
00:36:29,245 --> 00:36:30,285
Speaker 4:  You not know how this works? I don't know.

781
00:36:30,805 --> 00:36:30,925
Speaker 5:  I

782
00:36:30,925 --> 00:36:34,285
Speaker 4:  Didn't, your three left are awards Live and Wild card.

783
00:36:34,475 --> 00:36:37,165
Speaker 5:  Okay. I'm saving awards for less. Okay. I've got a good one for that

784
00:36:37,165 --> 00:36:38,645
Speaker 4:  One. I know you're very excited about this. I

785
00:36:38,645 --> 00:36:39,365
Speaker 5:  Know. So I've got Live

786
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:41,405
Speaker 4:  Live and Wild Card

787
00:36:41,545 --> 00:36:45,325
Speaker 5:  And Wild Card Ooh. That's tricky. So

788
00:36:45,325 --> 00:36:48,725
Speaker 5:  Live, I'm gonna go channels again. Okay. It worked last time. Explain

789
00:36:48,725 --> 00:36:49,605
Speaker 4:  To the people what channels.

790
00:36:49,605 --> 00:36:53,445
Speaker 5:  Okay. So Channels is an app. It's like a DVR app. You can, you can plug

791
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:57,325
Speaker 5:  it into your cable If, you still subscribe to Cable, you can plug

792
00:36:57,325 --> 00:36:59,965
Speaker 5:  it into an antenna and then you just DVR everything. It

793
00:36:59,965 --> 00:37:00,565
Speaker 4:  Also gets all the Fast

794
00:37:00,565 --> 00:37:03,245
Speaker 5:  Channels. Yeah. It gets all the fast channels. So you can go and like, just

795
00:37:03,245 --> 00:37:06,725
Speaker 5:  have your Pluto and have your Tube Tuby and then have your

796
00:37:07,485 --> 00:37:08,965
Speaker 5:  A, B, C and all of your other,

797
00:37:09,085 --> 00:37:11,765
Speaker 4:  I think it was you that described it to me as like an RSS reader for tv,

798
00:37:12,095 --> 00:37:13,565
Speaker 4:  which I found very compelling.

799
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:14,165
Speaker 5:  That's, that's

800
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:16,525
Speaker 4:  Kind true. It likes a nerdiest possible thing, but it's awesome.

801
00:37:16,825 --> 00:37:20,285
Speaker 5:  And it's sick. The guy's like very actively developing it. It's got a really

802
00:37:20,285 --> 00:37:24,245
Speaker 5:  pretty ui. I just, I just dig the hell out of it. I use it a lot. Okay.

803
00:37:24,245 --> 00:37:27,565
Speaker 5:  So I'm, I'm gonna go with that for my live, because it gets me all of my

804
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:31,765
Speaker 5:  lives. And then my Wild Card, I think this one's really obvious.

805
00:37:32,705 --> 00:37:36,605
Speaker 5:  It, it, it's gonna be paramount because, you know, somebody had to, it's

806
00:37:36,605 --> 00:37:38,725
Speaker 5:  like it's an 89 on the Go 90 scale.

807
00:37:38,915 --> 00:37:39,485
Speaker 3:  Yeah. The most

808
00:37:39,585 --> 00:37:42,605
Speaker 5:  89 channels. Yeah. Channels is like a zero. 'cause I, I, I don't think you,

809
00:37:42,705 --> 00:37:42,925
Speaker 5:  you

810
00:37:42,925 --> 00:37:43,965
Speaker 3:  Can't kill R Rss s Yeah.

811
00:37:43,965 --> 00:37:47,725
Speaker 5:  You can't kill R Ss. Yeah. But, but, but Paramount Plus is

812
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:50,285
Speaker 5:  definitely like an 89. It's as close as you can get

813
00:37:51,925 --> 00:37:55,875
Speaker 5:  until like, they sell it in a couple of weeks or whatever. So,

814
00:37:56,175 --> 00:38:00,035
Speaker 5:  but yeah. I I think it's a good wild card. It's, it's a fun, I I,

815
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:04,035
Speaker 5:  I enjoy the Cowboys and I enjoy the, the live stuff and

816
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:07,995
Speaker 5:  I enjoy the, the Star Trek. So it, like, it gets everything for

817
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:08,115
Speaker 5:  me.

818
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:11,795
Speaker 3:  And that wasn't enough to keep a Streaming service alive. No. Cowboy Cowboys

819
00:38:11,795 --> 00:38:12,275
Speaker 3:  and Star Trek.

820
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:15,355
Speaker 5:  You would think it would've been in 1966.

821
00:38:16,695 --> 00:38:20,155
Speaker 5:  And unfortunately me and the Boomers are the only ones that still watch it.

822
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:24,235
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But, but you know, it'll get merged with Peacock or something. So I'll

823
00:38:24,275 --> 00:38:25,195
Speaker 5:  have it all together again.

824
00:38:25,325 --> 00:38:29,235
Speaker 3:  There is a really good article about the demise of Paramount Plus that

825
00:38:29,235 --> 00:38:32,715
Speaker 3:  just talks about the, the sheer hubris, which was this product was launched.

826
00:38:32,945 --> 00:38:35,280
Speaker 3:  It's beautiful. Where they're like, well, we don't have a lot of a lot of

827
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,805
Speaker 3:  stuff, but we've got CBS, we've got Star Trek and we have Taylor Sheridan.

828
00:38:39,065 --> 00:38:41,085
Speaker 3:  And everyone's like, that's not enough stuff. Like, do you know how much

829
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:44,965
Speaker 3:  stuff Netflix has? They're like, no, no, no. CBS. It

830
00:38:44,965 --> 00:38:45,645
Speaker 3:  turned out that the great,

831
00:38:45,805 --> 00:38:49,205
Speaker 5:  I mean, it worked for them for like, what, 30 years as, as a broadcast network.

832
00:38:49,365 --> 00:38:52,525
Speaker 5:  CBS was the most watched broadcast network. So they're like, yeah. And you're

833
00:38:52,525 --> 00:38:55,525
Speaker 4:  One of only three things that exists to watch Yeah,

834
00:38:55,525 --> 00:38:58,565
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Crush. Yeah. When they had like a monopoly crush it kinda like a pseudo

835
00:38:58,765 --> 00:39:02,485
Speaker 5:  monopoly. They crushed it. Yeah. And then more competition came and they,

836
00:39:03,195 --> 00:39:04,605
Speaker 5:  they're in 89 on. Yeah. It gets

837
00:39:04,605 --> 00:39:06,205
Speaker 4:  Tougher when you're 80 Channel two.

838
00:39:06,315 --> 00:39:09,845
Speaker 3:  Yeah. One thing single handedly keeping CBS alive. This is a true story.

839
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:13,925
Speaker 3:  Alex is addicted to 60 Minutes. Yes. She walks into our newsroom

840
00:39:14,305 --> 00:39:18,125
Speaker 3:  at least twice a week and is like, I saw this thing in 60 Minutes. And all

841
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:20,885
Speaker 3:  of us have to be like, well, definitionally Alex, that means it happened

842
00:39:20,885 --> 00:39:22,325
Speaker 3:  eight months ago. It's true.

843
00:39:23,205 --> 00:39:26,765
Speaker 5:  I love it. It's my favorite show. It just gives you a really good insight

844
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:30,485
Speaker 5:  into what CBS once boomers to think about. Yeah. And I

845
00:39:30,645 --> 00:39:32,045
Speaker 5:  love that. I wanna know that too.

846
00:39:32,515 --> 00:39:32,805
Speaker 3:  Yeah,

847
00:39:33,865 --> 00:39:34,395
Speaker 4:  It's a good time.

848
00:39:34,535 --> 00:39:37,795
Speaker 5:  All right. Leslie Stall, I mean, oh my, my God. 89. I could talk about her

849
00:39:37,795 --> 00:39:41,155
Speaker 5:  for hours, but, but we, we don't have that much time to go, so

850
00:39:41,415 --> 00:39:42,155
Speaker 4:  We don't Yeah,

851
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:45,195
Speaker 3:  You're up next. I think about South by Southwest. I think about Leslie Stall.

852
00:39:45,345 --> 00:39:45,635
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

853
00:39:45,635 --> 00:39:47,355
Speaker 5:  Leslie Stall fangirling

854
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:51,075
Speaker 3:  Specifically. We, yeah, exactly. David, you're up next. Oh, it's me.

855
00:39:52,105 --> 00:39:54,875
Speaker 3:  Crap. All right, well I've got, I've got two left, right? Yeah. Yes.

856
00:39:55,665 --> 00:39:59,515
Speaker 3:  4K. 4K and Niche Niche. Well, this next one can go into

857
00:39:59,515 --> 00:40:03,475
Speaker 3:  either one. Okay. I'm picking my new favorite Streaming service Bravia

858
00:40:03,475 --> 00:40:07,435
Speaker 3:  Core. Oh God. The Streaming service only available on select Sony Top. Neil,

859
00:40:07,675 --> 00:40:07,795
Speaker 3:  I

860
00:40:07,795 --> 00:40:09,955
Speaker 4:  Just instantly lost the Draft. Congratulations.

861
00:40:10,335 --> 00:40:13,555
Speaker 3:  It has four movies on it and they all look amazing. They're all

862
00:40:13,555 --> 00:40:14,155
Speaker 5:  Spiderman

863
00:40:14,155 --> 00:40:16,915
Speaker 3:  Streams of 80 megabits per second is out of control. Sony owns no movies.

864
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:20,875
Speaker 3:  It owns no ip. It's just like old Spider-Man movies. You have to set the

865
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:24,755
Speaker 3:  TV to allow it to stream it like this level of bandwidth.

866
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:25,115
Speaker 3:  Do you have to

867
00:40:25,115 --> 00:40:28,275
Speaker 4:  Like call your cable company? You're like, listen, it's about to get weird

868
00:40:28,655 --> 00:40:32,275
Speaker 3:  Two hours. So this is a true fact about Sony is like such a big

869
00:40:32,275 --> 00:40:35,755
Speaker 3:  disconnected company. They make the TVs, only the TVs support the Streaming

870
00:40:35,755 --> 00:40:39,715
Speaker 3:  service. They did not put an ethernet port on the TVs that is

871
00:40:39,715 --> 00:40:43,635
Speaker 3:  fast enough to support the Streaming service. So you either have

872
00:40:43,635 --> 00:40:47,355
Speaker 3:  to use wifi or you have to buy a USB ethernet adapter like a us

873
00:40:47,385 --> 00:40:51,355
Speaker 3:  This is a trip. So I did it. It's great. I love it. I've never had

874
00:40:51,355 --> 00:40:54,315
Speaker 3:  more fun in my life, not watching movies and instead configuring the settings

875
00:40:54,315 --> 00:40:56,235
Speaker 3:  of my tv. It's very good.

876
00:40:56,615 --> 00:40:59,115
Speaker 5:  So where is it on the go nineties? It's like a zero, right? Oh,

877
00:40:59,115 --> 00:41:00,595

Speaker 3:  pristine quality of your entire life, like you can see every four, which

881
00:41:08,995 --> 00:41:12,915
Speaker 3:  I did. I did it So I watched the shit outta Ghostbusters two and then I showed

882
00:41:12,915 --> 00:41:16,355
Speaker 3:  it to other people and they were like, why are we watching Ghostbusters two?

883
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:18,675
Speaker 3:  I would just like 4K IMAX right now. You don't

Speaker 4:  Have to pick this. you know that, right? Yeah. No one, no one from

885
00:41:22,465 --> 00:41:23,595
Speaker 4:  Sony is like back there.

886
00:41:24,135 --> 00:41:24,355
Speaker 5:  You

887
00:41:24,355 --> 00:41:25,555
Speaker 4:  Have choices. No pointing anything at you.

888
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:29,595
Speaker 3:  There's a lot in the free, the glorious state of Texas. I'm

889
00:41:29,685 --> 00:41:32,995
Speaker 3:  exercising my free market rights as an American to pick

890
00:41:33,425 --> 00:41:37,405
Speaker 3:  Bravia core, the best Streaming service. That is the weirdest to use,

891
00:41:37,915 --> 00:41:41,405
Speaker 3:  that has a credit system that makes no sense. Sometimes it just forgets.

892
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:44,965
Speaker 3:  It gave you, it's all very bad, but it's all

893
00:41:45,485 --> 00:41:48,805
Speaker 3:  glorious. Like, I want every one of these services to offer me like stream

894
00:41:48,885 --> 00:41:52,605
Speaker 3:  a Blu-ray to me. And that's, that's what David's just looking at me. He's

895
00:41:52,605 --> 00:41:53,485
Speaker 3:  like, you should stop talking.

896
00:41:53,755 --> 00:41:54,645
Speaker 5:  He's horrified.

897
00:41:55,195 --> 00:41:55,605
Speaker 3:  It's good.

898
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:58,485
Speaker 4:  I just always thought it was a bit when you would come in and be like, I

899
00:41:58,485 --> 00:42:00,325
Speaker 4:  watched a movie on Bravia court and

900
00:42:00,325 --> 00:42:01,085
Speaker 3:  Now I'm like, oh no,

901
00:42:01,135 --> 00:42:02,565
Speaker 4:  Neela loves Bravia court.

902
00:42:03,245 --> 00:42:03,845
Speaker 3:  I do like

903
00:42:04,065 --> 00:42:06,645
Speaker 5:  You have like a little monitor to show it so that it always shows you what

904
00:42:06,645 --> 00:42:07,205
Speaker 5:  the bit rate is.

905
00:42:07,385 --> 00:42:10,685
Speaker 3:  Do you think I don't have the Arrow app on my phone open showing me how fast

906
00:42:11,085 --> 00:42:13,925
Speaker 3:  internet speed is going on the TV while, while I watch something like Zero

907
00:42:13,955 --> 00:42:15,925
Speaker 3:  Dark 30 again? Is that what I'm

908
00:42:15,925 --> 00:42:18,605
Speaker 4:  Like I usually don't watch zero Dark 30. It's just up there while you watch

909
00:42:19,155 --> 00:42:20,485
Speaker 4:  your Euro app. It's very

910
00:42:20,485 --> 00:42:23,685
Speaker 3:  Good. Yeah. And then I've, I've told this story before. If, you watch zero

911
00:42:23,685 --> 00:42:26,125
Speaker 3:  dark 30 and then you have a small child who is not compliant about eating.

912
00:42:26,185 --> 00:42:29,325
Speaker 3:  You start accidentally like saying torture words to your small child.

913
00:42:30,575 --> 00:42:33,445
Speaker 3:  She's like zero, dark 30 is like very intense. And then the next day I was

914
00:42:33,445 --> 00:42:36,565
Speaker 3:  like, your behavior determines how you're treated. She's like, I'm not eating

915
00:42:36,565 --> 00:42:39,725
Speaker 3:  the apples. Don't do that. Just like, don't do that to your child.

916
00:42:42,025 --> 00:42:45,645
Speaker 4:  All right, now it's me. We've got one left too. I have two left, but I get

917
00:42:45,645 --> 00:42:48,845
Speaker 4:  to do 'em both right now. Oh wow. Serious. Which feels like a lot of pressure.

918
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:52,925
Speaker 4:  So I'm gonna pick two B for 4K because I just now this second confirmed that

919
00:42:52,925 --> 00:42:56,285
Speaker 4:  there is at least one 4K thing on two B and it's a fireplace video.

920
00:42:56,965 --> 00:43:00,725
Speaker 4:  Like, it's like a ule log situation, but it counts.

921
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:04,725
Speaker 4:  It's 4K and it's on two B So. I get to have it. So that's going in

922
00:43:04,725 --> 00:43:07,845
Speaker 4:  4K. Okay. Okay. Pretty psyched about it. That works. I should have picked

923
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:11,125
Speaker 4:  Tuby for a different one. I did this Draft poorly. Yeah. Has it has turned

924
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:11,325
Speaker 4:  out

925
00:43:11,325 --> 00:43:12,365
Speaker 3:  Here're at the end. We're just picking stuff,

926
00:43:12,505 --> 00:43:15,245
Speaker 4:  But we're coming around. It could have been long. That'll be fine. I just

927
00:43:16,085 --> 00:43:19,165
Speaker 4:  realized all of my wild cards were gone two rounds ago. So it's been like

928
00:43:19,165 --> 00:43:21,725
Speaker 4:  kind of messing with me for a while. Yeah. But it's okay. So, I'm picking

929
00:43:21,795 --> 00:43:25,165
Speaker 4:  Tuby. Okay. Which I actually think is like 30,

930
00:43:25,475 --> 00:43:28,685
Speaker 4:  somewhere in that range. On the scale. It's like

931
00:43:29,135 --> 00:43:33,005
Speaker 4:  doing really well. It's like sneakily very popular. Also Fox has no

932
00:43:33,005 --> 00:43:36,005
Speaker 4:  other Streaming anything to do. Yeah. So they just give everything to Tuby.

933
00:43:36,385 --> 00:43:40,045
Speaker 4:  But also toy's whole thing was, it's free and there's ads

934
00:43:40,505 --> 00:43:44,405
Speaker 4:  and that's where everybody else is going. Yep. So

935
00:43:44,675 --> 00:43:48,405
Speaker 4:  that could be bad. Yeah. And so now they're like, what If you? Yeah. They're

936
00:43:48,405 --> 00:43:50,925
Speaker 4:  like, now they're like, well we have to get some good content. How do we

937
00:43:50,925 --> 00:43:54,765
Speaker 4:  do that? It's like, oh no, welcome to everyone else's

938
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:55,685
Speaker 4:  hell from the last 12 days.

939
00:43:55,685 --> 00:43:58,605
Speaker 5:  Well, they just go to like Z Love and they're like, Hey, is there any show

00:44:08,315 --> 00:44:08,885

Speaker 3:  Was perfect. you know, it's, it was great because I actually don't dunno

951
00:44:18,985 --> 00:44:22,725
Speaker 4:  What's the other one? I think for, for my wild card.

952
00:44:23,365 --> 00:44:25,005
Speaker 4:  I think I'm taking Instagram reels,

953
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:27,085
Speaker 3:  Which feels

954
00:44:27,345 --> 00:44:28,725
Speaker 4:  Insane as I say it out loud.

955
00:44:28,845 --> 00:44:32,565

Speaker 4:  Hey, TikTok has slideshows. Now

959
00:44:39,785 --> 00:44:43,245

00:44:43,345 --> 00:44:43,845
Speaker 3:  all in a row.

961
00:44:46,035 --> 00:44:46,325

00:45:05,325 --> 00:45:09,125
Speaker 3:  By the way, taking to be an Instagram rails back to back is

970
00:45:09,155 --> 00:45:10,605
Speaker 3:  just the saddest man. It feels

971
00:45:10,605 --> 00:45:11,045
Speaker 4:  Great. No,

972
00:45:11,045 --> 00:45:12,885

Speaker 3:  All right. Who's next? NELI. Crap. I wasn't prepared. I was, this is

992
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:11,405
Speaker 4:  Why. I don't know, sir, your last one is Niche. This is all you have left.

993
00:47:12,345 --> 00:47:15,645
Speaker 3:  So David just updated the spreadsheet with the word Sony Bravia Court, and

994
00:47:15,645 --> 00:47:18,525
Speaker 3:  somehow Google Docs transmitted his disdain.

995
00:47:20,915 --> 00:47:24,365
Speaker 3:  Alright. So my, the last category I have left is Niche. Correct.

996
00:47:25,595 --> 00:47:26,585
Speaker 3:  Which is tough here.

997
00:47:29,925 --> 00:47:30,045
Speaker 3:  I

998
00:47:30,385 --> 00:47:31,285
Speaker 4:  You are not allowed to pick

999
00:47:31,365 --> 00:47:35,285
Speaker 3:  A flex service. I have to think of a stream. Yeah. Okay. I know, I know

1000
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:39,085
Speaker 3:  what I'm gonna do. I feel weird about it. I'm gonna say it. It's only

1001
00:47:39,085 --> 00:47:42,565
Speaker 3:  because my, my father-in-law's at my house, and he has been watching this

1002
00:47:42,565 --> 00:47:45,205
Speaker 3:  Streaming service nonstop since he arrived.

1003
00:47:46,335 --> 00:47:47,325
Speaker 3:  Motor Trend tv.

1004
00:47:49,315 --> 00:47:50,485
Speaker 4:  Tell us about Motor Trend tv.

1005
00:47:50,765 --> 00:47:54,685
Speaker 3:  A Motor Trend TV is an app that plays motor trend content at you.

1006
00:47:55,665 --> 00:47:59,645
Speaker 3:  If. you are interested in older cars being turned into nicer cars. Do I have

1007
00:47:59,645 --> 00:48:03,285
Speaker 3:  an app for you? my friends? Have you ever thought about watching a show where

1008
00:48:03,285 --> 00:48:05,405
Speaker 3:  some dudes go to a car auction?

1009
00:48:06,225 --> 00:48:07,725
Speaker 4:  That's it. That's the whole

1010
00:48:08,865 --> 00:48:10,605
Speaker 5:  Do they, do they bid or do they just go

1011
00:48:11,165 --> 00:48:15,125
Speaker 3:  Well, they, they talk about whether they would bid. Is it worth it? It's

1012
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:19,005
Speaker 3:  very much like PBS but with cars and, you know, I

1013
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:22,765
Speaker 3:  I also find it, cap it. I'm not a car nerd, I just can't, the duration

1014
00:48:23,425 --> 00:48:26,885
Speaker 3:  it is currently being displayed in my home is really quite something. And

1015
00:48:26,885 --> 00:48:28,525
Speaker 3:  So, I just for the family. I'm doing this niche

1016
00:48:28,745 --> 00:48:30,885
Speaker 4:  For the family. Family. And this is like a thing you can turn on and it just

1017
00:48:30,885 --> 00:48:31,765
Speaker 4:  keeps happening at you.

1018
00:48:31,955 --> 00:48:35,845
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It's, it is like a full grid guide of MotorTrend content. Fair enough.

1019
00:48:36,035 --> 00:48:36,325
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

1020
00:48:36,465 --> 00:48:37,165
Speaker 5:  It is niche.

1021
00:48:37,475 --> 00:48:38,285
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It's the

1022
00:48:38,285 --> 00:48:39,005
Speaker 4:  Most, yeah. Counts. I

1023
00:48:39,005 --> 00:48:39,765
Speaker 5:  Would say that is the most, I'm

1024
00:48:39,765 --> 00:48:42,845
Speaker 3:  Pretty certain my father-in-Law is keeping this service afloat. Yeah.

1025
00:48:43,315 --> 00:48:44,205
Speaker 5:  It's just him. Yeah.

1026
00:48:44,205 --> 00:48:45,525
Speaker 4:  Is this MotorTrend one word or two

1027
00:48:45,525 --> 00:48:49,205
Speaker 3:  Words? It's one word. I think One word, but two word. Like TV is a different

1028
00:48:49,205 --> 00:48:50,045
Speaker 3:  word. you know what

1029
00:48:50,045 --> 00:48:53,485
Speaker 4:  I'm saying? MotorTrend tv. Yeah. Got it. That's right. Yeah. Okay.

1030
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:55,885
Speaker 4:  That's not what I thought you were gonna say. All right. What did

1031
00:48:55,885 --> 00:48:56,405
Speaker 3:  You think I was gonna say?

1032
00:48:56,565 --> 00:49:00,005
Speaker 4:  I something other than that, so many choices.

1033
00:49:00,925 --> 00:49:02,325
Speaker 5:  I was really excited to find out.

1034
00:49:02,555 --> 00:49:04,965
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I was really thinking about like, what's at the bottom of my Apple

1035
00:49:04,985 --> 00:49:08,165
Speaker 3:  TV grid and then, dude. Oh, that's

1036
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:08,645
Speaker 4:  Interesting.

1037
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:10,925
Speaker 3:  None of it's just a, it's a wasteland of Gone nine.

1038
00:49:11,035 --> 00:49:14,885
Speaker 4:  Mine is like BBC America. Yeah. And like a PBS app

1039
00:49:14,915 --> 00:49:18,805
Speaker 4:  that won't let me log in anymore because I canceled my account when I

1040
00:49:18,805 --> 00:49:22,245
Speaker 4:  moved. Yeah. And they were like, no, you hate PBS in America. You can't get

1041
00:49:22,245 --> 00:49:22,645
Speaker 4:  in anymore.

1042
00:49:23,005 --> 00:49:24,605
Speaker 5:  Yeah. They get really mad when you move.

1043
00:49:24,715 --> 00:49:25,325
Speaker 4:  Very upset.

1044
00:49:25,485 --> 00:49:26,005
Speaker 5:  PBS is

1045
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:29,125
Speaker 4:  Just so upset. Yeah. NPR is mad at me now. It's a whole thing. I'm so, all

00:49:38,585 --> 00:49:40,445
Speaker 5:  Muy M So Alex's line.

1052
00:49:40,525 --> 00:49:41,805

1053
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:43,325
Speaker 5:  It's real. It's real. And it's,

1054
00:49:43,585 --> 00:49:44,645
Speaker 3:  That's not Tubi?

1055
00:49:45,345 --> 00:49:46,445
Speaker 5:  No, it's

1056
00:49:46,625 --> 00:49:48,085
Speaker 3:  Mui. Got it. Okay.

1057
00:49:48,715 --> 00:49:52,645
Speaker 5:  It's real. I I swear it's real. I saw it when I was walking in. They had

1058
00:49:52,645 --> 00:49:54,405
Speaker 5:  some signs outside and I went and I, you like,

1059
00:49:54,475 --> 00:49:58,045
Speaker 3:  Were like, in case I need to think of a fifth Streaming service. I

1060
00:49:58,045 --> 00:49:58,925
Speaker 5:  Forgot about movie.

1061
00:49:59,065 --> 00:50:01,445
Speaker 3:  And, and then you check to make sure they'd won an Oscar. Yeah.

1062
00:50:01,555 --> 00:50:04,845
Speaker 5:  Because because movie is all independent films

1063
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:07,365
Speaker 5:  from the last few decades. That's a

1064
00:50:07,365 --> 00:50:09,085
Speaker 4:  Good one. What? Oscar? Did it win a

1065
00:50:09,085 --> 00:50:09,245
Speaker 5:  Lot?

1066
00:50:09,585 --> 00:50:10,725
Speaker 4:  No, no, no, no, no, no. Hold

1067
00:50:10,725 --> 00:50:11,205
Speaker 5:  On. No, no, no.

1068
00:50:11,205 --> 00:50:15,125
Speaker 4:  Hold on. This is not a movie that won. An Oscar is available on this

1069
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:19,085
Speaker 4:  service. Yeah. That's nothing. This is a, this is a

1070
00:50:19,095 --> 00:50:20,885
Speaker 4:  movie original. She chose

1071
00:50:20,885 --> 00:50:23,125
Speaker 5:  Disney Plus as his award

1072
00:50:23,345 --> 00:50:26,805
Speaker 3:  One. 'cause they paid for the movies. An Oscar. What did like, Disney.

1073
00:50:27,385 --> 00:50:27,605
Speaker 3:  The

1074
00:50:27,605 --> 00:50:31,165
Speaker 4:  Oscar. A documentary Oscar, thanks to Questlove. Alex. Cranz.

1075
00:50:31,705 --> 00:50:34,765
Speaker 4:  And then I made a whole Disney plus original joke. Where have you been? Alex?

1076
00:50:34,915 --> 00:50:35,205
Speaker 4:  Wait,

1077
00:50:35,205 --> 00:50:37,405
Speaker 5:  Wait, where have you been? This? But you're saying that I can't just choose

1078
00:50:37,405 --> 00:50:38,245
Speaker 5:  like No,

1079
00:50:38,245 --> 00:50:39,125
Speaker 4:  That's all of them.

1080
00:50:39,665 --> 00:50:40,765
Speaker 5:  So I couldn't have you.

1081
00:50:40,945 --> 00:50:44,805
Speaker 4:  It has a movie available that has won an Oscar. Is is is

1082
00:50:44,805 --> 00:50:46,205
Speaker 4:  TikTok in one minute? Increment.

1083
00:50:46,205 --> 00:50:50,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah, exactly. That's all of those. Exactly. I was, I was all ready for it.

1084
00:50:50,345 --> 00:50:50,565
Speaker 5:  So

1085
00:50:50,705 --> 00:50:53,645
Speaker 3:  You were just gonna pick, like it has a movie available that has one of Oscar.

1086
00:50:53,645 --> 00:50:54,725
Speaker 3:  Yes. Hundred percent Reddit.

1087
00:50:55,525 --> 00:50:56,885
Speaker 5:  A hundred percent. All right.

1088
00:50:57,605 --> 00:51:00,605
Speaker 3:  Hmm. This was the hardest category because of, for the, for because of this

1089
00:51:00,605 --> 00:51:03,765
Speaker 3:  rule. This exact reason. Because if not for the rule, it would be the easiest

1090
00:51:04,205 --> 00:51:04,725
Speaker 3:  category. Right.

1091
00:51:04,725 --> 00:51:05,365
Speaker 4:  Because it is

1092
00:51:05,365 --> 00:51:06,925
Speaker 5:  The easiest category. It's all of them. All right.

1093
00:51:07,155 --> 00:51:09,365
Speaker 3:  Twitter has movies on it that everyone wants.

1094
00:51:09,765 --> 00:51:09,885
Speaker 5:  I

1095
00:51:09,885 --> 00:51:13,405
Speaker 3:  Know, by the way, he says it's a video first platform. Does Twitter count?

1096
00:51:13,425 --> 00:51:14,205
Speaker 3:  You could pick Twitter

1097
00:51:15,545 --> 00:51:19,525
Speaker 4:  If If, you can. If Tucker Carlson has won an Oscar while on X,

1098
00:51:20,145 --> 00:51:21,565
Speaker 4:  he can have it. Yeah, sure.

1099
00:51:21,585 --> 00:51:24,605
Speaker 5:  So it has to have been a Streaming service very specifically.

1100
00:51:25,345 --> 00:51:29,245
Speaker 4:  Yes. The, the company that hosts it has to

1101
00:51:29,245 --> 00:51:31,045
Speaker 4:  have made it and it has to have won an Oscar.

1102
00:51:31,075 --> 00:51:32,165
Speaker 5:  Then I'll choose Hulu.

1103
00:51:32,665 --> 00:51:34,085
Speaker 3:  She can do that. 'cause she's not in the bundle.

1104
00:51:34,195 --> 00:51:36,485
Speaker 4:  That is true. Okay. Bam. That's fair.

1105
00:51:37,025 --> 00:51:37,805
Speaker 5:  But movie's better.

1106
00:51:38,385 --> 00:51:38,605
Speaker 4:  No,

1107
00:51:39,115 --> 00:51:41,605
Speaker 3:  It's, you heard about movie just now? I

1108
00:51:41,605 --> 00:51:45,285
Speaker 5:  Know. And it looks really sick. I'm gonna go subscribe. It's got 4K.

1109
00:51:45,655 --> 00:51:47,485
Speaker 5:  There you go. It's got a lot of old movies,

1110
00:51:48,315 --> 00:51:49,765
Speaker 3:  Many of which have won Oscars. So

1111
00:51:50,085 --> 00:51:52,605
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's it's got award-winning content on it. Yeah,

1112
00:51:53,075 --> 00:51:53,365
Speaker 3:  Sure.

1113
00:51:53,585 --> 00:51:53,805
Speaker 5:  So

1114
00:51:54,165 --> 00:51:56,925
Speaker 4:  I. Think I won ISN and Theatrically distributes films by emerging and established

1115
00:51:56,925 --> 00:52:00,325
Speaker 4:  filmmakers. Unlike everything else that does that exact same thing. I

1116
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:03,365
Speaker 3:  Feel like the best case scenario for buying display advertising at South

1117
00:52:03,365 --> 00:52:07,085
Speaker 3:  by Southwest is people on a stage Googling what your company is in front

1118
00:52:07,085 --> 00:52:07,525
Speaker 3:  of an audience.

1119
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:09,645
Speaker 4:  I legitimately was like 40% search,

1120
00:52:09,645 --> 00:52:12,605
Speaker 3:  Like zero people have signed up, but we have definitely Googled it now. Alex

1121
00:52:12,655 --> 00:52:14,445
Speaker 4:  Cranz. Where is movie on the go nineties.

1122
00:52:15,355 --> 00:52:16,805
Speaker 3:  This is the worst case scenario.

1123
00:52:17,685 --> 00:52:17,925
Speaker 5:  Advertising.

1124
00:52:17,945 --> 00:52:18,325
Speaker 3:  So by

1125
00:52:18,325 --> 00:52:20,405
Speaker 5:  Southwest, wait, no, it's a Hulu now, right?

1126
00:52:20,755 --> 00:52:21,045
Speaker 3:  Well,

1127
00:52:21,045 --> 00:52:21,645
Speaker 4:  I'd like you to do

1128
00:52:21,645 --> 00:52:25,485
Speaker 5:  Both. Okay. You want me to do both? Okay. Movie is,

1129
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:29,245
Speaker 5:  it feels like it's gonna be pretty low on the go. 90 scale. It feels like,

1130
00:52:29,245 --> 00:52:32,725
Speaker 5:  like a 20 because a lot of you like, like it was, it was just like you

1131
00:52:32,725 --> 00:52:33,805
Speaker 3:  Put a movie year

1132
00:52:33,805 --> 00:52:37,685
Speaker 4:  20, 28, Netflix is gone. Yeah, but

1133
00:52:37,775 --> 00:52:38,845
Speaker 4:  movie, movie

1134
00:52:39,215 --> 00:52:42,525
Speaker 5:  Curse this because like, nobody knows about movie and movie's just

1135
00:52:42,525 --> 00:52:45,325
Speaker 3:  Like, yeah, they can't kill it. If you can't find it. Yeah.

1136
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:48,525
Speaker 5:  It's, it's just, it's just like, it's just thriving over there in a corner.

1137
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,445
Speaker 5:  Oh good. And periodically you're like, you know what, I'll turn on movie

1138
00:52:51,825 --> 00:52:54,885
Speaker 5:  and Netflix though. Everybody's gonna like flip on it. Yeah. Netflix has

1139
00:52:54,995 --> 00:52:57,765
Speaker 3:  Like public company like Reed's gotta get out there and explain its content.

1140
00:52:57,765 --> 00:53:00,485
Speaker 3:  Movies just like, I don't know, we just licensed Oscar winning independent

1141
00:53:00,485 --> 00:53:00,565
Speaker 3:  film.

1142
00:53:00,565 --> 00:53:01,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah, they could do whatever

1143
00:53:01,285 --> 00:53:02,565
Speaker 3:  You want. Hard. I buy it. I buy it. Yeah.

1144
00:53:03,475 --> 00:53:04,565
Speaker 5:  Hulu on the other hand,

1145
00:53:06,685 --> 00:53:09,885
Speaker 5:  I chose a lot of 80 nines on this one. Huh? Yeah, because that's definitely

1146
00:53:09,885 --> 00:53:13,005
Speaker 5:  like an 89. Like it's, it doesn't have a lot of time left in this world.

1147
00:53:14,315 --> 00:53:16,245
Speaker 4:  Hulu might be the most 89 of

1148
00:53:16,355 --> 00:53:17,485
Speaker 5:  More than Paramount Plus.

1149
00:53:17,865 --> 00:53:18,885
Speaker 3:  No. Yeah. In no way.

1150
00:53:19,475 --> 00:53:23,445
Speaker 4:  Hulu is already actively dying. The person who owns Hulu has said he's guilty.

1151
00:53:23,515 --> 00:53:23,805
Speaker 4:  Well,

1152
00:53:23,805 --> 00:53:27,725
Speaker 3:  So saying like try to rank different 80 nines. That's

1153
00:53:27,845 --> 00:53:28,965
Speaker 3:  actually why you have other numbers.

1154
00:53:30,005 --> 00:53:31,685
Speaker 4:  I didn't give anything at 89. This is

1155
00:53:31,765 --> 00:53:35,725
Speaker 3:  A new problem. What is the most 89? It's like a question that has long been

1156
00:53:35,725 --> 00:53:36,485
Speaker 3:  solved by the

1157
00:53:36,485 --> 00:53:40,285
Speaker 5:  Existence of other. Paramount Plus is now an 87. Okay. And then we'll put

1158
00:53:40,435 --> 00:53:40,885
Speaker 5:  Hulu at

1159
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:41,885
Speaker 4:  89. Okay. There I, I can.

1160
00:53:41,945 --> 00:53:43,245
Speaker 5:  And then TikTok is at eight.

1161
00:53:43,405 --> 00:53:47,245
Speaker 3:  TikTok is 89. Like that's straight up. 88. You think it's 88.

1162
00:53:47,575 --> 00:53:50,205
Speaker 5:  Which do you think is more likely to not be here at the end of the year?

1163
00:53:50,205 --> 00:53:50,965
Speaker 5:  Paramount Plus

1164
00:53:51,985 --> 00:53:53,765
Speaker 3:  Or TikTok might not be here at the end of the week.

1165
00:53:54,485 --> 00:53:54,925
Speaker 5:  That's fair.

1166
00:53:56,655 --> 00:53:57,885
Speaker 3:  We'll see. I mean maybe, probably Will. The

1167
00:53:57,885 --> 00:54:00,205
Speaker 5:  Teens are strong. The teens are strong. People love their TikTok.

1168
00:54:00,635 --> 00:54:04,005
Speaker 3:  They they do. And they will VPN into China immediately. The teens

1169
00:54:04,505 --> 00:54:06,325
Speaker 3:  get me on the other side of that firewall. Yeah.

1170
00:54:06,445 --> 00:54:10,285
Speaker 5:  A lot of people are learning about VPNs. So, I. I think it, I think it'll

1171
00:54:10,285 --> 00:54:12,445
Speaker 5:  persist. I'm putting it into 88.

1172
00:54:12,985 --> 00:54:16,445
Speaker 3:  All right. Again, what is the most, 89 is a baffling question.

1173
00:54:17,205 --> 00:54:19,965
Speaker 3:  I think TikTok is right now at this moment. Who knows what's gonna happen.

1174
00:54:20,195 --> 00:54:23,765
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I think TikTok is 89. I think Paramount Plus is in 88. I think Hulu

1175
00:54:23,765 --> 00:54:27,285
Speaker 3:  is in 87. Okay. Hulu is famously un killable.

1176
00:54:27,795 --> 00:54:31,125
Speaker 3:  Like many, many, many people have tried to kill Hulu and they can't do it.

1177
00:54:31,285 --> 00:54:31,405
Speaker 3:  I

1178
00:54:31,405 --> 00:54:34,485
Speaker 5:  Would love if Bob was just like, couldn't do it. Just let it persist.

1179
00:54:34,545 --> 00:54:36,085
Speaker 3:  That's his next press conference. Somehow

1180
00:54:36,085 --> 00:54:36,765
Speaker 4:  Someone Don

1181
00:54:36,995 --> 00:54:39,085
Speaker 3:  Owns, I've been trying to kill this thing. He's like,

1182
00:54:39,405 --> 00:54:40,685
Speaker 5:  Hulu keeps going. We're gonna enjoy it.

1183
00:54:41,245 --> 00:54:43,885
Speaker 3:  I think, but I think they want to merge it into Disney. I think they want

1184
00:54:43,885 --> 00:54:47,285
Speaker 3:  that to be the brand. Like all this stuff. Yeah. It's gone on.

1185
00:54:47,995 --> 00:54:49,725
Speaker 3:  It's my my feeling. Yeah.

1186
00:54:49,955 --> 00:54:51,645
Speaker 4:  Hulu is not going to be around for very long.

1187
00:54:51,815 --> 00:54:55,085
Speaker 3:  We're gonna be so wrong. Like it's gonna be Hulu and movie. I'm so excited

1188
00:54:55,085 --> 00:54:55,965
Speaker 3:  to next

1189
00:54:56,035 --> 00:54:59,525
Speaker 4:  Year and Netflix has just gone out of business and Alex is like I told you,

1190
00:55:00,265 --> 00:55:03,845
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna be so vindicated. Plus is still around. Hulu is still around and

1191
00:55:03,845 --> 00:55:04,565
Speaker 5:  Netflix is gone.

1192
00:55:04,565 --> 00:55:06,245
Speaker 3:  Please watch my show on Netflix before.

1193
00:55:10,035 --> 00:55:13,485
Speaker 5:  Alright. You can watch it in a one minute Sections on Instagram reels.

1194
00:55:13,485 --> 00:55:17,365
Speaker 3:  Please watch The future up in one minute Increments on Instagram reels. That's

1195
00:55:17,365 --> 00:55:17,965
Speaker 3:  gonna go great for

1196
00:55:17,965 --> 00:55:20,245
Speaker 4:  Us. It's perfect. All right. That is the end of the Draft. Would you like

1197
00:55:20,245 --> 00:55:20,405
Speaker 4:  to read

1198
00:55:20,405 --> 00:55:21,645
Speaker 3:  That? The end of the Draft? Yeah. Yes,

1199
00:55:21,645 --> 00:55:25,565
Speaker 4:  Please. We've done it. Okay. Alex Cranz one first. Yes. And you picked

1200
00:55:26,155 --> 00:55:30,045
Speaker 4:  Peacock Movie slash Hulu. I'm actually gonna

1201
00:55:30,045 --> 00:55:32,605
Speaker 4:  give you both. Yes. I just feel like you should have both. Thank you. I

1202
00:55:32,605 --> 00:55:33,045
Speaker 5:  Appreciate

1203
00:55:33,045 --> 00:55:36,645
Speaker 4:  It. Fine. Netflix channels Crunchy Roll and

1204
00:55:36,645 --> 00:55:37,245
Speaker 4:  Paramount Plus,

1205
00:55:37,465 --> 00:55:39,605
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna have a great time watching all of my content.

1206
00:55:40,365 --> 00:55:41,525
Speaker 4:  I think there's legitimate,

1207
00:55:41,525 --> 00:55:43,965
Speaker 3:  There was just a dismissive his laugh from over there. I just wanna be very

1208
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:45,645
Speaker 3:  clear. I think there's, that didn't come through in

1209
00:55:46,165 --> 00:55:49,765
Speaker 4:  Election. Only two of yours still exist by the time we do this next NELI

1210
00:55:49,765 --> 00:55:53,485
Speaker 4:  and I picked TikTok, the Disney bundle. Nailed it. Sony Bravia

1211
00:55:53,565 --> 00:55:57,445
Speaker 4:  Co. Which is a real, real tank. YouTube TV with

1212
00:55:57,445 --> 00:56:00,045
Speaker 4:  Sunny Ticket MotorTrend tv. Yeah. And Max,

1213
00:56:00,325 --> 00:56:01,725
Speaker 3:  I just wanna point out, this is, you were

1214
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:02,725
Speaker 4:  All over the place today.

1215
00:56:03,155 --> 00:56:07,085
Speaker 3:  This is breath, this is depth. This is Oscar winning MotorTrend

1216
00:56:07,305 --> 00:56:09,845
Speaker 3:  TV At this point, if they don't win an Oscar, what are you doing?

1217
00:56:11,405 --> 00:56:15,285
Speaker 3:  Everyone else has Moy. Yeah. Yeah. I would say the range here is

1218
00:56:15,285 --> 00:56:18,925
Speaker 3:  unparalleled. The quality is unparalleled. The 4K is available.

1219
00:56:19,185 --> 00:56:23,005
Speaker 3:  If, you can get off your at t plan. There's no fight in it. Is

1220
00:56:23,125 --> 00:56:24,925
Speaker 5:  Is, is MotorTrend tv in 4K?

1221
00:56:25,745 --> 00:56:26,965
Speaker 3:  No, no, no.

1222
00:56:27,275 --> 00:56:27,685
Speaker 4:  It's not

1223
00:56:29,115 --> 00:56:29,405
Speaker 3:  Just

1224
00:56:29,655 --> 00:56:30,405
Speaker 4:  360 p

1225
00:56:30,405 --> 00:56:34,365
Speaker 3:  Dave. That that is being shot on a GoPro from 1994. It's, that's

1226
00:56:34,365 --> 00:56:35,445
Speaker 3:  the, that's the situation.

1227
00:56:35,805 --> 00:56:38,805
Speaker 4:  I love it. David, what did you choose? I picked YouTube. Okay. With ads.

1228
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:42,285
Speaker 4:  Yeah. All the ads. Apple tv,

1229
00:56:43,395 --> 00:56:47,325
Speaker 4:  tuby, prime Video, criterion Collection and Instagram reels. Honestly,

1230
00:56:47,325 --> 00:56:48,685
Speaker 4:  that's fine. Which I'm still having a lot of feelings.

1231
00:56:48,885 --> 00:56:51,485
Speaker 5:  I think you won actually thinking about it. I'm like, no,

1232
00:56:52,425 --> 00:56:54,965
Speaker 3:  I'm sorry. You picked YouTube with ads and Instagram res and you're gonna

1233
00:56:55,285 --> 00:56:55,405
Speaker 3:  W

1234
00:56:55,405 --> 00:56:56,365
Speaker 4:  You picked Ravi Co and Mo.

1235
00:56:57,275 --> 00:56:58,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. Like

1236
00:56:58,385 --> 00:56:58,805
Speaker 4:  80

1237
00:56:58,875 --> 00:56:59,165
Speaker 3:  Mega.

1238
00:56:59,345 --> 00:57:00,525
Speaker 4:  You can't all have winners man.

1239
00:57:01,705 --> 00:57:04,245
Speaker 3:  Why do, why do you have a gigabit in Inter Connection? What

1240
00:57:04,245 --> 00:57:06,045
Speaker 4:  Was the new movie that just came to Bravia Chord? The

1241
00:57:06,345 --> 00:57:10,205
Speaker 3:  Anyone but you a movie, which does not contain any sequences of action

1242
00:57:10,205 --> 00:57:13,845
Speaker 3:  fast enough to require 80 megabits per second. Like that movie can be compressed

1243
00:57:13,955 --> 00:57:15,125
Speaker 3:  into a series of still frames.

1244
00:57:15,155 --> 00:57:16,925
Speaker 4:  Glen, how I'll taking your shirt off looking great.

1245
00:57:16,945 --> 00:57:20,365
Speaker 3:  Here's Glen Powell. Here's Glen Powell next to another Jack Guy. Like

1246
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:23,925
Speaker 3:  just one frame at a time. It's barely, it's just a series of pictures going

1247
00:57:23,925 --> 00:57:24,405
Speaker 3:  by very quickly

1248
00:57:24,515 --> 00:57:27,285
Speaker 4:  That you could watch in one minute increments on TikTok and probably get

1249
00:57:27,285 --> 00:57:27,725
Speaker 4:  the vibe. Yeah. Oh,

1250
00:57:27,725 --> 00:57:31,405
Speaker 3:  Easily. And I'm confident that that will be like tiktoks entire content

1251
00:57:31,685 --> 00:57:34,325
Speaker 3:  strategy is a copyright infringement. Yeah. And also Chinese, these propaganda.

1252
00:57:35,865 --> 00:57:39,205
Speaker 3:  And you can just see, I, I maintain a list of tiktoks that I think should

1253
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:43,005
Speaker 3:  be media studies, PhDs happy to share. And all of them

1254
00:57:43,025 --> 00:57:45,405
Speaker 3:  are just layers upon layers of copyright infringement.

1255
00:57:45,915 --> 00:57:48,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah. That's good stuff. Alright. That's it. Hey, David's like that's, that's

1256
00:57:48,605 --> 00:57:48,805
Speaker 4:  the Draft

1257
00:57:48,985 --> 00:57:50,245
Speaker 3:  We did. We won. Who won?

1258
00:57:50,945 --> 00:57:52,365
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah. Let's, let's, let's

1259
00:57:52,395 --> 00:57:53,565
Speaker 3:  Declare yourself winner.

1260
00:57:54,045 --> 00:57:54,405

Speaker 3:  Three. We have an audience. Yeah.

1263
00:57:57,805 --> 00:58:01,365
Speaker 4:  Okay. No, you're right. Who thinks NELI won the Draft? Yeah, that's correct.

1264
00:58:01,365 --> 00:58:01,845
Speaker 4:  It a brutal

1265
00:58:02,585 --> 00:58:04,045
Speaker 5:  One person did raise their hands.

1266
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:05,365
Speaker 3:  That guy runs Bravia.

1267
00:58:05,475 --> 00:58:07,565
Speaker 4:  That was really nice of you. Yeah, that's

1268
00:58:07,565 --> 00:58:08,525
Speaker 3:  Steve. Sony right there

1269
00:58:08,525 --> 00:58:10,165
Speaker 4:  Thinks won the Draft Alex Cranz.

1270
00:58:11,115 --> 00:58:13,445
Speaker 5:  Look at that Crunchy Roll fans out there.

1271
00:58:14,585 --> 00:58:15,765
Speaker 4:  And who thinks I won the Draft
