Description: We've finally finished testing, scoring, and reviewing Apple's new gear for the fall. On this episode we talk through our reviews of the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro, the Apple Watch 10, and the AirPods 4, to see whether they're real upgrades and whether they're worth your money. And then, on the Vergecast Hotline (866-VERGE11), we make the case for the Pixel in 2024.

00:00:02,595 --> 00:00:06,165
Speaker 1:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of ugly

3
00:00:06,335 --> 00:00:10,085
Speaker 1:  color tinted app icons that we love. Anyway, I'm your friend

4
00:00:10,085 --> 00:00:13,925
Speaker 1:  David Pierce and I bought a new computer monitor. This is

5
00:00:13,925 --> 00:00:17,685
Speaker 1:  not like exciting big news, but to me it is exciting and big news. I went

6
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:21,645
Speaker 1:  from 24 inches to 27 inches, which is

7
00:00:21,765 --> 00:00:25,285
Speaker 1:  actually a bigger difference than I expected. I almost got a 32 inch monitor,

8
00:00:25,745 --> 00:00:28,845
Speaker 1:  but the idea of being one of those people who has to like look from side

9
00:00:28,865 --> 00:00:32,165
Speaker 1:  to side to see everything on my screen just felt

10
00:00:32,295 --> 00:00:35,525
Speaker 1:  ridiculous. It's just a normal like 4K de monitor.

11
00:00:36,405 --> 00:00:40,045
Speaker 1:  I don't think I'm good enough or sensitive

12
00:00:40,045 --> 00:00:43,845
Speaker 1:  enough to need a studio display or one of those LG ones that

13
00:00:43,845 --> 00:00:47,245
Speaker 1:  everybody likes that are, you know, thousands of dollars. I'm a simple man

14
00:00:47,275 --> 00:00:51,165
Speaker 1:  with simple pixel needs and this one makes me happy. But there is

15
00:00:51,165 --> 00:00:54,445
Speaker 1:  one feature about it that I deeply, deeply love already.

16
00:00:54,985 --> 00:00:58,845
Speaker 1:  So, I spend all of my time staring into webcams, right?

17
00:00:58,985 --> 00:01:02,765
Speaker 1:  I'm doing podcasts, we're making videos. I'm just in meetings.

18
00:01:02,865 --> 00:01:06,525
Speaker 1:  I'm using webcams all day, every day. That is the life of of modern

19
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:10,405
Speaker 1:  person it seems, and I never know where

20
00:01:10,545 --> 00:01:14,085
Speaker 1:  to look, right? You can do the thing where you like barrel the camera and

21
00:01:14,105 --> 00:01:16,925
Speaker 1:  it kind of freaks everybody out 'cause they're making eye contact with you

22
00:01:16,925 --> 00:01:20,485
Speaker 1:  over zoom. Or you can sort of look way down and

23
00:01:20,485 --> 00:01:23,725
Speaker 1:  they're looking at the top of your head, but you're looking at them and so

24
00:01:23,725 --> 00:01:27,485
Speaker 1:  there's no eye contact. It's weird. And what this monitor does

25
00:01:27,785 --> 00:01:30,685
Speaker 1:  is it just lets me, it just lets me slide it up and down. So I can go, I

26
00:01:30,685 --> 00:01:34,485
Speaker 1:  can go down so it's easier. It's like right at eye level. I can make

27
00:01:34,485 --> 00:01:38,365
Speaker 1:  eye contact, I can move it up. So then it's up there and it's

28
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:42,245
Speaker 1:  nice and high and now it's not weird because I can look at

29
00:01:42,245 --> 00:01:45,925
Speaker 1:  sort of a normal distance and I'm looking right into the screen and not into

30
00:01:45,925 --> 00:01:49,325
Speaker 1:  the camera. I love it. Now I can just

31
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:53,365
Speaker 1:  make whatever level of eye contact I want to and I can wield eye contact

32
00:01:53,585 --> 00:01:57,525
Speaker 1:  as a weapon instead of just awkwardly sort of staring down

33
00:01:57,705 --> 00:02:01,565
Speaker 1:  all the time. I'm unstoppable now. My webcam game

34
00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:06,045
Speaker 1:  is on point anyway. We're not here to talk about computer monitors or webcams

35
00:02:06,265 --> 00:02:10,245
Speaker 1:  or my deep eye contact. We are here to talk about Apple

36
00:02:10,245 --> 00:02:13,845
Speaker 1:  reviews. That's what we're gonna do on this whole show. All the new devices

37
00:02:13,915 --> 00:02:16,485
Speaker 1:  came out, we've reviewed all of them. That's actually the reason the show

38
00:02:16,505 --> 00:02:20,485
Speaker 1:  is a day late. Embargoes make everything complicated, but all

39
00:02:20,485 --> 00:02:23,925
Speaker 1:  of our reviews are out. The new iPhones, the new Apple watches, the new AirPods,

40
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:27,485
Speaker 1:  everything. And we're gonna spend this whole show talking about those, whether

41
00:02:27,505 --> 00:02:30,685
Speaker 1:  you should buy them, whether they're good upgrades, what all this means for

42
00:02:30,685 --> 00:02:34,325
Speaker 1:  the future of everything in our lives. So much to get to. It's gonna be very

43
00:02:34,325 --> 00:02:38,285
Speaker 1:  fun. All that is coming up in just a second, but I

44
00:02:38,285 --> 00:02:41,125
Speaker 1:  have been sitting here staring into this camera for way too long now and

45
00:02:41,325 --> 00:02:44,085
Speaker 1:  I gotta go take a break before we get into it. This is The Vergecast. We'll

46
00:02:44,085 --> 00:02:44,365
Speaker 1:  be right back.

47
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:04,725
Speaker 1:  where saying the words iPhone or 16 all just sounds not

48
00:04:04,725 --> 00:04:08,125
Speaker 1:  like words anymore. You know, that happens. It's not great, but

49
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:12,205
Speaker 1:  some spec bumps, some new buttons, some old buttons on new

50
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:16,405
Speaker 1:  phones. An interesting lineup this year. And I would say one of

51
00:04:16,405 --> 00:04:19,925
Speaker 1:  the more complicated ones to suss out which phone

52
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:24,005
Speaker 1:  is actually the right one for most people. So we're gonna get into that.

53
00:04:24,195 --> 00:04:27,685
Speaker 1:  Neil Patel and Allison Johnson have been reviewing these things ever since

54
00:04:27,825 --> 00:04:31,765
Speaker 1:  we got them and heard about them last week and they have lots of thoughts.

55
00:04:31,895 --> 00:04:35,765
Speaker 1:  Let's dive in. Neil Patel. Hello? Hello. Alison

56
00:04:35,765 --> 00:04:39,725
Speaker 1:  Johnson. Hi. Hello. Okay, so just to like pull back the cover

57
00:04:40,005 --> 00:04:43,845
Speaker 1:  slightly here we are doing this 24 hours before the

58
00:04:43,845 --> 00:04:46,965
Speaker 1:  review embargo, not even 20 hours before the review embargo for the iPhones,

59
00:04:47,095 --> 00:04:50,925
Speaker 1:  which is not a super fun time to do anything.

60
00:04:50,945 --> 00:04:54,085
Speaker 1:  If, you are the person having to review the iPhone. So just thank you both

61
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:57,965
Speaker 1:  for doing this to me. And also If, you just sort of like disappear into

62
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,885
Speaker 1:  insanity in the middle of this. I will, I will understand.

63
00:05:00,035 --> 00:05:02,445
Speaker 3:  Well actually, can I say one thing about that, which is I think very funny,

64
00:05:02,465 --> 00:05:06,165
Speaker 3:  please. The review period is a day longer than usual,

65
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:10,845
Speaker 3:  even though there's a full days less worth of stuff to talk

66
00:05:10,845 --> 00:05:11,605
Speaker 3:  about on these days,

67
00:05:12,215 --> 00:05:14,925
Speaker 1:  Right? 'cause the event was a Monday and it's normally Tuesday to Tuesday.

68
00:05:15,475 --> 00:05:15,765
Speaker 1:  Yeah.

69
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:17,525
Speaker 3:  And now it's Monday to Wednesday.

70
00:05:17,715 --> 00:05:21,365
Speaker 1:  It's Monday to Wednesday. Yeah. Every new button we get an extra day

71
00:05:22,325 --> 00:05:23,085
Speaker 1:  I think is how it works.

72
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:26,965
Speaker 3:  It's just fun. It's like for, for as little stuff as there is to say, we

73
00:05:26,965 --> 00:05:29,165
Speaker 3:  have much more time to say it, which I think is fascinating.

74
00:05:29,315 --> 00:05:30,165
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So, but I,

75
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:33,605
Speaker 3:  But please keep it this way Apple, if you're listening. Oh yeah. More time

76
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:35,925
Speaker 3:  is better. Which I've been telling them for a full decade.

77
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:39,645
Speaker 1:  No takebacks. Yeah, yeah, agreed. This is the bare minimum forever.

78
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:43,725
Speaker 1:  Apple. Okay, so Allison, you're doing the

79
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:47,445
Speaker 1:  regular iPhones and Neli, you've, you've been reviewing the pro, is that

80
00:05:47,445 --> 00:05:51,325
Speaker 1:  right? Yes. Okay, so let's just quickly dispense

81
00:05:51,325 --> 00:05:55,045
Speaker 1:  with all the stuff that is not on these phones yet, which is any sign of

82
00:05:55,045 --> 00:05:58,445
Speaker 1:  Apple intelligence. Have you noticed, like it's been a weird time. That was

83
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:02,325
Speaker 1:  the big thing. They talked about the, the iOS 18 came out,

84
00:06:02,325 --> 00:06:05,085
Speaker 1:  there's a bunch of new stuff in there, but none of the really Apple intelligence

85
00:06:05,085 --> 00:06:09,045
Speaker 1:  stuff, like do these phones feel incomplete in your lives

86
00:06:09,355 --> 00:06:12,205
Speaker 1:  without Apple intelligence stuff? Like how much should people write off the

87
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,125
Speaker 1:  fact that none of that is here yet?

88
00:06:15,065 --> 00:06:19,045
Speaker 4:  No, I'm, I'm finding it kind of easy to ignore. Like there's,

89
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,645
Speaker 4:  there's a ton of new stuff in iOS 18 actually without all the Apple

90
00:06:22,645 --> 00:06:26,445
Speaker 4:  intelligence. So it just very much feels like the new

91
00:06:26,545 --> 00:06:30,205
Speaker 4:  iPhone. Like there's two new buttons on the regular version. There's all

92
00:06:30,205 --> 00:06:34,045
Speaker 4:  this stuff to dig into in iOS 18. So

93
00:06:34,115 --> 00:06:37,365
Speaker 4:  that it's kind of outta my mind for the moment for sure.

94
00:06:38,055 --> 00:06:40,725
Speaker 1:  Neela, what about you? We had a big argument about this last week. We

95
00:06:40,725 --> 00:06:44,445
Speaker 3:  Did. I think these phones are incomplete in that

96
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:48,925
Speaker 3:  it's hard to make the case to buy one If. you have an

97
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:52,605
Speaker 3:  iPhone and the reason that you might buy particularly

98
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:56,525
Speaker 3:  the regular 16 is that it has the eight gigs of ram, which supports Apple

99
00:06:56,525 --> 00:07:00,325
Speaker 3:  intelligence, which is not here. So If, you have a regular iPhone and you

100
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:04,125
Speaker 3:  upgrade to the new iPhone 16, you'll have a nice experience. I,

101
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:07,605
Speaker 3:  Allison has had a nice experience. It's a nice phone, it's seven ninety nine,

102
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:11,565
Speaker 3:  you get a bunch of stuff, but it will be

103
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:14,725
Speaker 3:  essentially the same experience as upgrading a regular phone to iOS 18.

104
00:07:15,345 --> 00:07:18,405
Speaker 3:  And I think that's a real problem for Apple. I feel the same way on the pro

105
00:07:18,465 --> 00:07:22,125
Speaker 3:  as well. Particularly if a 15 pro, there is zero reason

106
00:07:22,465 --> 00:07:26,325
Speaker 3:  to get a 16 pro. Hmm. The 15 pro is getting Apple intelligence

107
00:07:26,325 --> 00:07:30,045
Speaker 3:  when it arrives. It's just hard to make the case So I. I've

108
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:34,125
Speaker 3:  spent a week with these phones, I've come up with one reason to upgrade them

109
00:07:35,225 --> 00:07:39,165
Speaker 3:  and that is so wonky and you have to

110
00:07:39,165 --> 00:07:43,045
Speaker 3:  be such a photo nerd to even make the argument that I don't think

111
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:43,605
Speaker 3:  it's convincing.

112
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:46,685
Speaker 1:  Okay, well that is where we're going to spend most of our time. But I, I

113
00:07:46,685 --> 00:07:49,965
Speaker 1:  am curious, big picture, Alison, has that been your, your takeaway too? Like

114
00:07:49,965 --> 00:07:53,845
Speaker 1:  pretty good phone, nothing to sort of run out to the store

115
00:07:53,845 --> 00:07:54,365
Speaker 1:  for here?

116
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:58,405
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think, like, I agree with everything Neil says

117
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:01,925
Speaker 4:  except that there's no reason to upgrade to it. I think it is like

118
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:06,685
Speaker 4:  it's, it's the, we're on like a three or four year cadence of

119
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:10,445
Speaker 4:  like, you hold onto your iPhone and you're sort of doing this dance of

120
00:08:10,445 --> 00:08:14,005
Speaker 4:  like, should I upgrade? Should I not upgrade? And this is excluding anybody

121
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:18,005
Speaker 4:  who's like super interested in a five x telephoto lens or like any of

122
00:08:18,005 --> 00:08:21,965
Speaker 4:  the, the cool pro stuff that happens. So, I don't, I think for someone who's

123
00:08:21,965 --> 00:08:25,725
Speaker 4:  doing that dance of like, is it now do I upgrade now? Like this

124
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:29,765
Speaker 4:  is a really good year to upgrade, but yeah, you, it's it's

125
00:08:29,765 --> 00:08:32,725
Speaker 4:  gonna be an iPhone. It's gonna be a lot like the iPhone you had.

126
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:35,765
Speaker 1:  I do like that as a way of thinking about it actually. 'cause there is the

127
00:08:35,885 --> 00:08:39,485
Speaker 1:  question of like, is this the phone you've been waiting for?

128
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:43,765
Speaker 1:  And I think the answer is no. But the question is if, if the

129
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:47,285
Speaker 1:  question is, should you wait for the next one, the answer's also kind of

130
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:50,605
Speaker 1:  no. Yeah. Which says something about like the, just the path that we're on

131
00:08:50,605 --> 00:08:53,165
Speaker 1:  with the iPhone, but it's also a nice place to be. It's like, If, you need

132
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:56,405
Speaker 1:  a new phone, go buy this one. You'll like it. Yeah. And it will do the things

133
00:08:56,405 --> 00:09:00,245
Speaker 1:  that are coming, you won't feel left out by the time we get

134
00:09:00,245 --> 00:09:00,925
Speaker 1:  to the next one.

135
00:09:01,035 --> 00:09:04,645
Speaker 3:  There's also just the reality of how most people are acquiring these phones

136
00:09:04,705 --> 00:09:07,765
Speaker 3:  now, which is they're, they're on payment plans, they're carriers on a cycle.

137
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:11,725
Speaker 3:  Right? So will this phone just happen to you? It will, it

138
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:15,405
Speaker 3:  will just occur to you and you'll, you'll fi you'll wake up one day and you'll

139
00:09:15,405 --> 00:09:18,205
Speaker 3:  have an iPhone 16 and that will just be the end of it. And I think that's

140
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:22,165
Speaker 3:  fine and weird, but it is true as Allison points out. But those upgrade cycles

141
00:09:22,505 --> 00:09:26,165
Speaker 3:  can get much longer now. And that to me is why I keep saying the phone's

142
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:29,925
Speaker 3:  incomplete because you would ideally Apple

143
00:09:29,925 --> 00:09:33,765
Speaker 3:  would get to push up the upgrade cycle by offering the suite of new

144
00:09:33,965 --> 00:09:36,365
Speaker 3:  features that you can't get on any of the other iPhone. And that is just

145
00:09:36,365 --> 00:09:37,165
Speaker 3:  not the case right now.

146
00:09:37,595 --> 00:09:40,565
Speaker 1:  Yeah, that, that's fair. So before we get into the camera stuff, which is

147
00:09:40,565 --> 00:09:44,245
Speaker 1:  I assume where we are going to get very lost in the weeds of, of Eli's feelings,

148
00:09:44,465 --> 00:09:47,605
Speaker 1:  is there anything else about these that you wanna like, spend some time talking

149
00:09:47,605 --> 00:09:50,165
Speaker 1:  about? I think we've talked about the action button feels like it's good

150
00:09:50,485 --> 00:09:54,045
Speaker 1:  that that's coming to the, the base level phones. Has anything else really

151
00:09:54,045 --> 00:09:57,205
Speaker 1:  like jumped out at you and your experiences here? Alison, I'm particularly

152
00:09:57,205 --> 00:10:01,165
Speaker 1:  curious for you with the, the entry level phone quote unquote

153
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:01,965
Speaker 1:  entry level phone.

154
00:10:03,585 --> 00:10:06,325
Speaker 1:  Is there anything that you feel like has, has jumped out in your experience

155
00:10:06,325 --> 00:10:07,245
Speaker 1:  so far that we should talk about?

156
00:10:07,785 --> 00:10:11,725
Speaker 4:  No, it's sort of just been a feeling like, oh, this is nice

157
00:10:11,755 --> 00:10:15,045
Speaker 4:  that this is here. You know, I spent some time with a 15 pro

158
00:10:15,345 --> 00:10:19,085
Speaker 4:  before I moved over to the 16 that I'm reviewing

159
00:10:19,545 --> 00:10:23,285
Speaker 4:  and just feeling like, oh, okay, I get this little action button and I program

160
00:10:23,305 --> 00:10:27,085
Speaker 4:  it to open the daycare app. So when I'm signing my kid out, there isn't like

161
00:10:27,525 --> 00:10:31,325
Speaker 4:  a line of people behind me while I'm fumbling around trying to find an app.

162
00:10:32,225 --> 00:10:36,045
Speaker 4:  So it's like, just, just little nice, nice to have things here and there.

163
00:10:37,585 --> 00:10:41,005
Speaker 4:  But yeah, the, the real actions in the, the camera stuff I think.

164
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:44,445
Speaker 1:  Okay. Let's, let's just get into this now and

165
00:10:45,675 --> 00:10:49,205
Speaker 1:  Neli I would like you to explain, so what I would call

166
00:10:49,585 --> 00:10:53,285
Speaker 1:  not quite an existential crisis, but like a deep philosophical

167
00:10:53,555 --> 00:10:56,765
Speaker 1:  hole you have fallen into over the last week about

168
00:10:57,425 --> 00:11:00,765
Speaker 1:  the iPhone sixteens camera. Yeah. What has your experience been?

169
00:11:00,765 --> 00:11:03,965
Speaker 3:  There's just a lot going on with this camera. So I think the first thing

170
00:11:03,965 --> 00:11:07,685
Speaker 3:  to say is that the pro camera is, is in fact

171
00:11:07,685 --> 00:11:11,165
Speaker 3:  significantly better than the regular iPhone 16 camera. We've gotten a lot

172
00:11:11,165 --> 00:11:14,485
Speaker 3:  of questions from folks that are asking whether the pro is worth it this

173
00:11:14,485 --> 00:11:18,405
Speaker 3:  year because on paper the specs seem pretty much the same And, then

174
00:11:18,405 --> 00:11:21,445
Speaker 3:  you actually look at the photos and the pro cameras just substantially better.

175
00:11:21,465 --> 00:11:25,445
Speaker 3:  The main camera is substantially better. It can capture more light, it has

176
00:11:25,445 --> 00:11:29,245
Speaker 3:  bigger pixels, all this stuff. But as you use them, and particularly as you

177
00:11:29,245 --> 00:11:33,045
Speaker 3:  use the new photographic styles, Alison and I have been talking and the entire

178
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,205
Speaker 3:  vibe from Apple is like, you figure it out.

179
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,925
Speaker 3:  Like what does, what do you want? What do you want photos to look like? You

180
00:11:39,925 --> 00:11:43,445
Speaker 3:  just, you just, you, whatever you want is fine. Whatever color you want the

181
00:11:43,445 --> 00:11:46,885
Speaker 3:  people to be is fine. And that is just like,

182
00:11:47,555 --> 00:11:51,525
Speaker 3:  it's not wrong, right? Like that is a pretty valid approach to

183
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:55,485
Speaker 3:  give the person taking the photo control over what the photos look

184
00:11:55,485 --> 00:11:59,385
Speaker 3:  like. But Apple also ships the most popular camera

185
00:11:59,565 --> 00:12:03,545
Speaker 3:  in the world and it, it is like they have just let go of having a

186
00:12:03,545 --> 00:12:07,065
Speaker 3:  point of view, which is I think a big change.

187
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:11,305
Speaker 3:  And it's not a big change in the sense that like it's doing wild AI stuff.

188
00:12:11,655 --> 00:12:15,425
Speaker 3:  It's just a big ch like once you let go of what

189
00:12:15,425 --> 00:12:19,385
Speaker 3:  color people are like, it's, there's not much left

190
00:12:19,385 --> 00:12:21,105
Speaker 3:  to hold onto. You know what I mean? Yeah.

191
00:12:21,495 --> 00:12:25,225
Speaker 1:  Real quick, how do you actually use the styles? It's, it's a thing we saw

192
00:12:25,225 --> 00:12:28,425
Speaker 1:  like bits and pieces of it in the announcement, but you guys have actually

193
00:12:28,455 --> 00:12:31,985
Speaker 1:  used these, like how do they fit into the workflow of using the camera

194
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:34,025
Speaker 3:  In, in like 10 different ways?

195
00:12:35,295 --> 00:12:39,065
Speaker 1:  Well this is why I ask because it's, it's not, my initial impression was

196
00:12:39,065 --> 00:12:42,145
Speaker 1:  that it was kind of like an Instagram filter where like you take a picture

197
00:12:42,165 --> 00:12:45,345
Speaker 1:  And then it's like these are the things it can look like it, it seems like

198
00:12:45,485 --> 00:12:48,305
Speaker 1:  it is that and not that at the same time

199
00:12:48,605 --> 00:12:51,585
Speaker 3:  It is, it is not though there it's much fancier than Instagram filters. But

200
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:54,905
Speaker 3:  at the end I think most people perceive them to be Instagram filters. Okay.

201
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,705
Speaker 3:  Do you know what I mean? Like they're an Instagram filter literally just

202
00:12:57,705 --> 00:13:01,625
Speaker 3:  sits over the top of your photo, right? Apple controls the whole imaging

203
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:05,705
Speaker 3:  pipeline so it can just do a higher quality job of adding colors and

204
00:13:05,705 --> 00:13:09,465
Speaker 3:  shadows and whatever. So yeah, apple is running the same,

205
00:13:10,045 --> 00:13:13,785
Speaker 3:  you know, take up to nine photos, HDR imaging pipeline

206
00:13:13,895 --> 00:13:17,705
Speaker 3:  that they always have been, they call it photo engine, which is very funny.

207
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:23,305
Speaker 3:  And all they've really done is reshuffle the steps so that you can edit the

208
00:13:23,325 --> 00:13:27,025
Speaker 3:  styles after you've taken a photo. That's it. Like, it's the same

209
00:13:27,155 --> 00:13:30,705
Speaker 3:  basic steps as the iPhone 15. And the thing that they've changed is

210
00:13:31,055 --> 00:13:34,905
Speaker 3:  when you take your nine photos that expose everything in the

211
00:13:34,905 --> 00:13:38,705
Speaker 3:  photo evenly, now you can do things like change which

212
00:13:38,755 --> 00:13:42,225
Speaker 3:  parts of the photo expose at what rates, how many shadows there are.

213
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:46,305
Speaker 3:  They can semantically detect faces. So you can

214
00:13:46,445 --> 00:13:50,425
Speaker 3:  adjust things like the undertones and skin tone, which is one set of filters.

215
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:54,065
Speaker 3:  Or you can go pretty wild into what they call the mood filters.

216
00:13:54,735 --> 00:13:58,425
Speaker 3:  Then that's much more like the Fuji film recipes where you're like

217
00:13:58,425 --> 00:14:02,265
Speaker 3:  simulating a film stock that has different colors and it, it's cool, all

218
00:14:02,265 --> 00:14:05,905
Speaker 3:  of it is cool And. then the actual controls of it are, you can do it live

219
00:14:05,905 --> 00:14:09,385
Speaker 3:  with a preview. You can switch the styles using the new camera control

220
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:13,225
Speaker 3:  and you like slide along And. then there's a really important control that

221
00:14:13,225 --> 00:14:15,785
Speaker 3:  we'll get to called Tone, which you can also adjust while you're taking a

222
00:14:15,785 --> 00:14:19,625
Speaker 3:  photo that is the HDR ness of a photo,

223
00:14:19,845 --> 00:14:23,665
Speaker 3:  for lack of a better term. And you can just turn it down. Like

224
00:14:24,775 --> 00:14:27,465
Speaker 3:  when I say there's one reason to buy this camera, it's that you can just

225
00:14:27,495 --> 00:14:31,425
Speaker 3:  turn off apple's super intense HDR look and make

226
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:35,225
Speaker 3:  it look like a normal camera again. That's, and so you can control

227
00:14:35,225 --> 00:14:39,105
Speaker 3:  that. Or once you've taken a photo you open the, the

228
00:14:39,105 --> 00:14:42,465
Speaker 3:  photo picker and you can change the styles and it is a

229
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:46,665
Speaker 3:  dpad, which is a, just a totally fiddly

230
00:14:46,665 --> 00:14:50,585
Speaker 3:  way of dealing with this. Yeah. But it's like you have a, a little two axis

231
00:14:50,735 --> 00:14:53,445
Speaker 3:  dpad of what your photo looks like and you can mess around with it

232
00:14:53,745 --> 00:14:57,575
Speaker 1:  Is, so this sounds like the kind of thing that is like extra

233
00:14:57,765 --> 00:15:01,135
Speaker 1:  editing features as the way you're describing it, which seems like

234
00:15:01,765 --> 00:15:04,535
Speaker 1:  fine, they're just like, here's some stuff you might do in Lightroom. We're

235
00:15:04,535 --> 00:15:07,095
Speaker 1:  gonna let you do it in the photos app.

236
00:15:08,405 --> 00:15:12,295
Speaker 1:  Allison, are you using this as, as much as Neli is? Like has this

237
00:15:12,295 --> 00:15:16,015
Speaker 1:  caused you as much philosophical pain as this has caused Neli over the last

238
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:16,215
Speaker 1:  week?

239
00:15:16,365 --> 00:15:19,455
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I, I don't know if pain's the right, well no pain is the right word.

240
00:15:20,885 --> 00:15:24,615
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I am super into it. Like I, I am a person

241
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:28,615
Speaker 4:  who want, I want more shadows in my photos. I'm, I'm tired of,

242
00:15:28,835 --> 00:15:32,815
Speaker 4:  you know, everything being smooshed into this gray middle ground. Yes.

243
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:36,815
Speaker 4:  And this feels like the answer to a lot of people

244
00:15:36,905 --> 00:15:40,855
Speaker 4:  being like, skin tones look weird on my iPhone

245
00:15:41,115 --> 00:15:44,335
Speaker 4:  or like, I don't like all this HDR processing and yeah, they're just going

246
00:15:44,335 --> 00:15:47,215
Speaker 4:  like, okay, you do the work then.

247
00:15:48,355 --> 00:15:52,055
Speaker 4:  But I like that 'cause I like getting in there and messing with

248
00:15:52,355 --> 00:15:56,055
Speaker 4:  things. It's kind of wonky how you set it up.

249
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,935
Speaker 4:  Like I think with the previous photographic styles you would just kind of

250
00:16:00,145 --> 00:16:03,655
Speaker 4:  swipe to one And then like you can make that your

251
00:16:03,765 --> 00:16:07,695
Speaker 4:  default from the camera app. I think this time

252
00:16:07,695 --> 00:16:11,415
Speaker 4:  around you kind of have to go through this like setup process

253
00:16:11,745 --> 00:16:15,735
Speaker 4:  where it's like, pick four of your favorite photos that you've

254
00:16:15,735 --> 00:16:19,695
Speaker 4:  taken with this camera. And there's like a whole philosophical thing of

255
00:16:19,695 --> 00:16:23,655
Speaker 4:  like, you know, the, the thesis is like to get you

256
00:16:23,795 --> 00:16:27,655
Speaker 4:  to dial in the skin tone, you kind of prefer like

257
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:31,255
Speaker 4:  a warmer or cooler cast. And so you're like, is this four

258
00:16:31,255 --> 00:16:35,175
Speaker 4:  pictures of me? Is this four pictures of my kid? Like what, what does this

259
00:16:35,175 --> 00:16:39,095
Speaker 4:  mean? So there's a weird kind of, I kind of had to work

260
00:16:39,095 --> 00:16:42,695
Speaker 4:  through all that And then I settled on one. I think I like

261
00:16:42,695 --> 00:16:46,455
Speaker 3:  Allison and I both have families with ranges of skin tones in them. So you're

262
00:16:46,455 --> 00:16:49,415
Speaker 3:  like, I'm gonna pick these four photos And, then I'm gonna pick a style.

263
00:16:49,435 --> 00:16:53,335
Speaker 3:  And it's like who? Yeah, I think we both landed on our kids. Yeah. Who

264
00:16:53,335 --> 00:16:54,975
Speaker 3:  are like interesting in the middle.

265
00:16:55,885 --> 00:16:59,815
Speaker 4:  Like, like I only, I only accidentally take a picture of my husband

266
00:17:00,255 --> 00:17:04,055
Speaker 4:  sometimes like it's all pictures of my kid. But yeah,

267
00:17:04,115 --> 00:17:06,455
Speaker 4:  he is sort of in the middle ground there. Yeah.

268
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:09,015
Speaker 3:  And that picker is actually really interesting 'cause you open it and it

269
00:17:09,015 --> 00:17:12,135
Speaker 3:  says pick four photos and you think you're gonna do something

270
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:16,295
Speaker 3:  algorithmic or mathematical, but it's just a preview. Hmm. It's

271
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:20,215
Speaker 3:  just preview. Like you can slide through the presets And, then pick one you

272
00:17:20,215 --> 00:17:23,455
Speaker 3:  like And, then that is the default, which is I think a little odd. You can

273
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,855
Speaker 3:  also just change it after the fact. You can leave it, you can, you mess with

274
00:17:26,855 --> 00:17:28,855
Speaker 3:  the camera controls. There's so many camera controls now you can leave it.

275
00:17:28,855 --> 00:17:32,695
Speaker 3:  So it's sticky once you pick one. There's all the stuff you can do to

276
00:17:32,695 --> 00:17:36,415
Speaker 3:  get the camera to consistently shoot the photos you want them to look, but

277
00:17:36,415 --> 00:17:39,975
Speaker 3:  there's nothing bad at the sort of guides you to it

278
00:17:40,465 --> 00:17:44,335
Speaker 3:  apart from pick four photos of someone and pick

279
00:17:44,335 --> 00:17:47,095
Speaker 3:  an undertone that it becomes the preferred undertone.

280
00:17:47,605 --> 00:17:50,925
Speaker 1:  Yeah, that's really interesting there there's, there's such a like power

281
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:54,805
Speaker 1:  of defaults thing in that that feels so unapply to me that

282
00:17:54,805 --> 00:17:58,605
Speaker 1:  it's like app Apple is for better and for worse the

283
00:17:58,605 --> 00:18:02,285
Speaker 1:  most aggressive company maybe in tech at being like, here is how this

284
00:18:02,285 --> 00:18:06,245
Speaker 1:  should work. Yeah. And it has, it has sort of slowly rolled it back

285
00:18:06,345 --> 00:18:10,205
Speaker 1:  in such a way that If you want to change things, you can, but it has

286
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:13,085
Speaker 1:  still always had really strong opinions about how things should be.

287
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:16,525
Speaker 3:  And so what's really interesting here is one, all of these features are on

288
00:18:16,525 --> 00:18:19,965
Speaker 3:  both the pro phone and the regular phone. The camera control, the styles,

289
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:23,765
Speaker 3:  the sliders, the tone, all of it is there on both phones, which is

290
00:18:24,205 --> 00:18:27,965
Speaker 3:  fascinating. And. then the default, the take it outta the box,

291
00:18:27,965 --> 00:18:31,605
Speaker 3:  take a picture. It's even more HDR than it was before.

292
00:18:31,785 --> 00:18:32,245
Speaker 1:  Oh really?

293
00:18:32,665 --> 00:18:35,685
Speaker 3:  So Apple has heard all this feedback. They've got taken all this criticism,

294
00:18:35,785 --> 00:18:39,485
Speaker 3:  you know, in the review video you'll see we just have a super cut of people

295
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:43,245
Speaker 3:  on TikTok saying the camera looks bad on the FN 15 Pro Alex

296
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:47,005
Speaker 3:  Earl to 7 million followers is like, why does the iPhone 15 camera suck?

297
00:18:47,635 --> 00:18:50,325
Speaker 3:  I've been reviewing things a long time, I will never publish anything that

298
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:54,085
Speaker 3:  devastating. That's, that's bad, right? That's a bad place

299
00:18:54,445 --> 00:18:57,205
Speaker 3:  for them to be. Yeah. And they, instead of walking it back, they've added

300
00:18:57,205 --> 00:19:01,005
Speaker 3:  these controls, but then the photos one to one are

301
00:19:01,235 --> 00:19:05,205
Speaker 3:  even brighter from the 15 Pro to the 16 pro. The photos from the 16

302
00:19:05,205 --> 00:19:09,165
Speaker 3:  pro are even like massively brighter than the photos from the 16. So

303
00:19:09,165 --> 00:19:12,525
Speaker 3:  Apple's really leaning into, we're gonna bring down all the bright parts

304
00:19:12,545 --> 00:19:15,325
Speaker 3:  and bring up all the shadows and everything will be totally flat. So you

305
00:19:15,325 --> 00:19:19,285
Speaker 3:  can see all the detail. But then they're adding this control, which is, you

306
00:19:19,285 --> 00:19:23,205
Speaker 3:  know, tone is like a weird word to put in the top level

307
00:19:23,265 --> 00:19:27,045
Speaker 3:  of a camera. Yeah. Right. And what they mean, what that means is

308
00:19:27,075 --> 00:19:30,685
Speaker 3:  tone mapping, which is not a word that anyone knows. No.

309
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:33,685
Speaker 3:  Like it what most people when they see tone, I think they think of the old

310
00:19:33,685 --> 00:19:37,605
Speaker 3:  control and like a CRT TV that would make everything green or like make

311
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:38,565
Speaker 3:  everything blue. Right.

312
00:19:38,805 --> 00:19:40,565
Speaker 1:  It's it's a color slider. Yeah.

313
00:19:40,575 --> 00:19:43,965
Speaker 3:  Right. And this what this actually is a shadows. So they're, they're taking

314
00:19:43,995 --> 00:19:47,885
Speaker 3:  that big stack of nine photos And, then they're, you know, by tone mapping

315
00:19:47,945 --> 00:19:51,765
Speaker 3:  it, you're, you're saying, okay, I'm gonna find all the right exposures across

316
00:19:51,765 --> 00:19:55,485
Speaker 3:  the whole image and add them all up. So you get one even image with detail

317
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:58,325
Speaker 3:  everywhere. So the blacks don't go to black and the brights don't go to white.

318
00:19:58,795 --> 00:20:02,365
Speaker 3:  It's just gonna be stuff everywhere. And tone mapping by turning it down,

319
00:20:02,365 --> 00:20:05,045
Speaker 3:  they're saying we're gonna do that less. And that's it. That's the whole

320
00:20:05,045 --> 00:20:07,925
Speaker 3:  control. And it is confusing and weird and I think people are gonna think

321
00:20:07,925 --> 00:20:11,885
Speaker 3:  it's just brightness, but it is actually controlling the HDR processing.

322
00:20:12,065 --> 00:20:16,045
Speaker 1:  So it sounds like the possibility, like you're going to be

323
00:20:16,045 --> 00:20:19,925
Speaker 1:  able to take better looking photos on the 16 maybe

324
00:20:19,925 --> 00:20:23,605
Speaker 1:  than on any iPhone before. But If, you don't touch it, your photos might

325
00:20:23,605 --> 00:20:24,525
Speaker 1:  be even worse.

326
00:20:24,985 --> 00:20:27,005
Speaker 3:  And yeah, this, and to me yes, I agree.

327
00:20:27,035 --> 00:20:30,685
Speaker 1:  Like lower floor and higher ceiling than a lot of iPhone photos

328
00:20:30,775 --> 00:20:33,765
Speaker 1:  we've seen before. Yeah. Which is a really strange place to be. We're like

329
00:20:33,825 --> 00:20:36,765
Speaker 1:  min maxing the, the phone set up here.

330
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:40,365
Speaker 3:  It's, we, I think Apple's default is getting away from them. I, I think they

331
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:44,125
Speaker 3:  have like some ideological rules about never wanting to lose any

332
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:47,845
Speaker 3:  detail, never letting things clip, never showing you noise. They're still

333
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:51,325
Speaker 3:  doing an awful lot of sharpening and noise introduction. Like

334
00:20:51,755 --> 00:20:55,045
Speaker 3:  it's just all over the place in these phones. So if that's the thing that

335
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:58,845
Speaker 3:  bothers you, the tone control isn't gonna help you. But I think that

336
00:20:58,845 --> 00:21:01,485
Speaker 3:  Apple has these rules that like If, you anyone pulls out a photo and takes

337
00:21:01,485 --> 00:21:04,365
Speaker 3:  a photo, they should be able to generate a usable image no matter how hard

338
00:21:04,385 --> 00:21:08,205
Speaker 3:  it is. Which is incredible, right? Like that has not been true

339
00:21:08,205 --> 00:21:10,205
Speaker 3:  of most cameras in most situations. Right.

340
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:11,805
Speaker 1:  And that's a reasonable starting point.

341
00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:15,525
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Like people love taking backlit photos. Like they, people are like

342
00:21:15,965 --> 00:21:19,285
Speaker 3:  a window, let me stand in front of it. And then complain that the faces are

343
00:21:19,285 --> 00:21:22,685
Speaker 3:  in shadow and the iPhone just doesn't have this problem anymore. Like

344
00:21:23,585 --> 00:21:27,285
Speaker 3:  you can just do it and it can solve that problem, which is kind of incredible.

345
00:21:27,865 --> 00:21:31,765
Speaker 3:  But it also means that other thing, like the trade-offs of that are, are

346
00:21:31,945 --> 00:21:35,685
Speaker 3:  bad. Like people are complaining about those trade-offs now. But the weirdness

347
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:38,805
Speaker 3:  of it for me in, in sort of the upgrade conversation is If, you are the person

348
00:21:38,805 --> 00:21:42,645
Speaker 3:  who didn't like the way the 15 photos looked. You're gonna not like the

349
00:21:42,645 --> 00:21:46,605
Speaker 3:  16 photos even more unless you know to go into the

350
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:50,445
Speaker 3:  settings to mess with the tone control to set the, the undertones

351
00:21:50,505 --> 00:21:54,485
Speaker 3:  to like, to really adjust the camera to your liking, which implies one,

352
00:21:54,785 --> 00:21:58,525
Speaker 3:  you know why you don't like the 15 photos and two, you understand what those

353
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,725
Speaker 3:  controls mean so she can get them to a place where you do like them while

354
00:22:01,725 --> 00:22:05,645
Speaker 3:  the default is getting worse. So you might be taking one step forward, but

355
00:22:05,885 --> 00:22:07,285
Speaker 3:  actually like two steps back and the upgrade.

356
00:22:07,635 --> 00:22:11,045
Speaker 1:  Well, and and to your point about this coming to all of the phones,

357
00:22:11,725 --> 00:22:15,245
Speaker 1:  I think if you're Apple, you can get away with that

358
00:22:15,415 --> 00:22:18,885
Speaker 1:  trade off to some extent on the pro and especially the pro max, right? Like

359
00:22:18,885 --> 00:22:21,685
Speaker 1:  you're, you're selling these things to an audience of people who are willing

360
00:22:21,685 --> 00:22:25,645
Speaker 1:  to pay more, to get more tools with which to

361
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:29,085
Speaker 1:  do stuff. And I think that's where you can say like, look, If, you want to

362
00:22:29,085 --> 00:22:33,005
Speaker 1:  have this other stuff here it is, but it's, it's gonna be more complicated.

363
00:22:33,065 --> 00:22:36,365
Speaker 1:  But here it is, I think on the $799 iPhone 16,

364
00:22:37,385 --> 00:22:41,085
Speaker 1:  the default thing out of the box becomes much, much, much more

365
00:22:41,085 --> 00:22:43,445
Speaker 1:  important. Yeah. And that's where I start to worry that you're gonna get

366
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,045
Speaker 1:  a lot of people who are disappointed with this camera because they don't

367
00:22:46,045 --> 00:22:49,765
Speaker 1:  know and maybe shouldn't have to know all this other

368
00:22:49,765 --> 00:22:51,045
Speaker 1:  stuff that they can do with it.

369
00:22:51,445 --> 00:22:53,885
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I honestly think Apple should have labeled these presets in a much

370
00:22:53,925 --> 00:22:57,775
Speaker 3:  stupider way. Like point and shoot camera, camera

371
00:22:57,885 --> 00:23:01,735
Speaker 3:  with big lens, you know, like Yeah. Like

372
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:05,535
Speaker 3:  just some instead of right wing tone. Which again,

373
00:23:06,165 --> 00:23:09,015
Speaker 3:  once you understand it, it's very powerful and it, to me it is the reason

374
00:23:09,015 --> 00:23:12,615
Speaker 3:  to buy this phone. I am a very unique individual

375
00:23:12,835 --> 00:23:16,415
Speaker 3:  in that sense. Like I just want shadows in my photo. I'm gonna spend money

376
00:23:16,435 --> 00:23:20,135
Speaker 3:  on a new phone. Like weird, I own 50 cameras, I can just get

377
00:23:20,135 --> 00:23:24,095
Speaker 3:  shadows at any time. Right. But I think for most

378
00:23:24,095 --> 00:23:27,695
Speaker 3:  people these presets are just, they're a bunch of words. And then Alison,

379
00:23:27,815 --> 00:23:30,615
Speaker 3:  I don't know If, you've had this experience, the camera control is pretty

380
00:23:31,215 --> 00:23:34,415
Speaker 3:  sensitive and it's kind of easy to get yourself sideways.

381
00:23:34,965 --> 00:23:37,455
Speaker 3:  Yeah. By adjusting stuff you had no intention of adjusting.

382
00:23:37,515 --> 00:23:38,655
Speaker 1:  Oh, interesting. Yeah,

383
00:23:39,215 --> 00:23:42,215
Speaker 4:  I, I have had some struggles with the camera control and

384
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,815
Speaker 4:  boy was I primed to like it,

385
00:23:46,465 --> 00:23:50,165
Speaker 4:  but I'm just generally finding it like really stiff

386
00:23:50,545 --> 00:23:54,325
Speaker 4:  to like, you do the full press and you do the actual button press

387
00:23:54,425 --> 00:23:58,045
Speaker 4:  to take a photo And, then there's all the other stuff that you can

388
00:23:58,245 --> 00:24:01,485
Speaker 4:  accidentally mess with. It's, it's that like hap kind of light press

389
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:05,965
Speaker 4:  And, then you slide your finger to change one of

390
00:24:05,965 --> 00:24:09,125
Speaker 4:  those settings or like do a double press and you'll pick another setting.

391
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:13,365
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I found myself like I'm trying so hard not to shake

392
00:24:13,365 --> 00:24:17,125
Speaker 4:  the phone and I'm pushing down on the shutter button but not hard

393
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:20,965
Speaker 4:  enough and I keep pushing and like my finger will move a little bit and

394
00:24:20,965 --> 00:24:24,845
Speaker 4:  I'll change the exposure come up and I'm like, this is bad. Like

395
00:24:24,925 --> 00:24:28,725
Speaker 4:  I was just trying to take a photo now. Yeah. Like I am paying way

396
00:24:28,725 --> 00:24:32,365
Speaker 4:  more attention to like the camera settings than I am the thing I'm taking

397
00:24:32,445 --> 00:24:32,965
Speaker 4:  a picture of.

398
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,965
Speaker 3:  Mostly I just want the controls to go away. Yeah, right. Once you adjust

399
00:24:36,965 --> 00:24:40,885
Speaker 3:  like on any other camera you like adjust the control, your finger

400
00:24:40,885 --> 00:24:44,685
Speaker 3:  doesn't stay on the control. Yeah. And this is because it's a

401
00:24:44,965 --> 00:24:48,645
Speaker 3:  capacitive slider and a button you like adjust it with a capacitive part

402
00:24:48,645 --> 00:24:52,045
Speaker 3:  And, then your finger's still on it to push a photo and the control is still

403
00:24:52,045 --> 00:24:54,845
Speaker 3:  there. So you're still adjusting the control while you're pushing the shutter

404
00:24:54,845 --> 00:24:57,285
Speaker 3:  button and it's all just a little bit too much. Yeah. And

405
00:24:57,285 --> 00:25:01,125
Speaker 4:  You're supposed to tap on the screen to get the controls

406
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,925
Speaker 4:  to go away. And I'm like, well then I'm tapping back, tapping under

407
00:25:03,925 --> 00:25:04,605
Speaker 3:  It. I'm so

408
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:07,805
Speaker 4:  Close going back and Yeah, no, don't make me do that. You

409
00:25:07,805 --> 00:25:10,165
Speaker 1:  Know what that makes me think of is like, you know when you're using a, a

410
00:25:10,165 --> 00:25:13,325
Speaker 1:  game controller and you're supposed to click with the joystick and how long

411
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:17,125
Speaker 1:  it takes to learn to click the joystick without moving the joystick so that

412
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:19,765
Speaker 1:  you're suddenly slightly in the wrong place when you're clicking.

413
00:25:20,905 --> 00:25:24,445
Speaker 1:  and we talked about this on the show last week that like the, the upside

414
00:25:24,445 --> 00:25:27,965
Speaker 1:  of this would be forget all the funky stuff in the middle.

415
00:25:28,065 --> 00:25:31,045
Speaker 1:  Mostly what you want to do is just mash the button and take a picture and

416
00:25:31,045 --> 00:25:33,205
Speaker 1:  If you mash the button, it will take a picture. It sounds like it's actually

417
00:25:33,205 --> 00:25:37,005
Speaker 1:  maybe not even quite nailing that, that sometimes you

418
00:25:37,005 --> 00:25:40,645
Speaker 1:  wanna mash the button and you can't mash the button and so you're accidentally

419
00:25:40,645 --> 00:25:43,485
Speaker 1:  doing the stuff in the middle while you're trying to just mash the button.

420
00:25:43,595 --> 00:25:44,045
Speaker 1:  Yeah, no,

421
00:25:44,425 --> 00:25:47,605
Speaker 3:  You can just mash the button. It's just If you change anything

422
00:25:48,175 --> 00:25:51,205
Speaker 3:  using the button, then you can't mash the button anymore.

423
00:25:51,545 --> 00:25:53,405
Speaker 1:  Oh okay. I see. Right. It's

424
00:25:53,405 --> 00:25:56,205
Speaker 3:  Like you just can't get outta that unless you tap the screen and once you've

425
00:25:56,205 --> 00:25:58,365
Speaker 3:  tapped the screen, you might as well just be tapping the screen.

426
00:25:58,595 --> 00:26:02,485
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Right. Yeah. At that point, what, what are we accomplishing here? Okay,

427
00:26:03,405 --> 00:26:07,325
Speaker 1:  interesting. Ha. Have you guys liked the camera control? Like has it become

428
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:11,205
Speaker 1:  part of the sort of muscle memory of using your phone

429
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:12,725
Speaker 1:  in the time you've been testing it? I

430
00:26:12,725 --> 00:26:16,525
Speaker 4:  Will say I'm using it to launch the camera and that I am,

431
00:26:16,865 --> 00:26:18,245
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna stick with that. You know, like

432
00:26:18,265 --> 00:26:19,645
Speaker 1:  So you're using it as an action button?

433
00:26:20,155 --> 00:26:20,925
Speaker 4:  It's Yeah, but

434
00:26:21,005 --> 00:26:22,165
Speaker 1:  I want my action button action.

435
00:26:22,485 --> 00:26:25,925
Speaker 4:  I want two action buttons. I want the other action button to do whatever

436
00:26:25,965 --> 00:26:29,445
Speaker 4:  I want And then this one, yeah. I'm using to launch the camera and I have

437
00:26:29,445 --> 00:26:33,325
Speaker 4:  it set on exposure comp because if you've ever tried to

438
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:36,405
Speaker 4:  change the brightness of a photo while you're taking a picture on the iPhone,

439
00:26:36,435 --> 00:26:40,325
Speaker 4:  it's like the most infuriating thing. So I think I'm

440
00:26:40,325 --> 00:26:43,485
Speaker 4:  gonna like that in the long term. But yeah, I've just gone back to like launch

441
00:26:43,485 --> 00:26:47,325
Speaker 4:  it with the camera control And, then push the onscreen shutter button.

442
00:26:47,515 --> 00:26:50,685
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Exposure conversation is a good one. 'cause that one you can't change

443
00:26:50,685 --> 00:26:54,605
Speaker 3:  after the fact, but tone you can. Interesting. So you, you just,

444
00:26:54,605 --> 00:26:57,725
Speaker 3:  again, you're just kind of like making all these like calculations while

445
00:26:57,725 --> 00:26:58,805
Speaker 3:  you take an iPhone photo. Now

446
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:03,765
Speaker 3:  the other thing that I'll say is there are so many ways to launch camera

447
00:27:03,765 --> 00:27:07,325
Speaker 3:  apps in iOS 18 on one of these new phones because you can set

448
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:11,365
Speaker 3:  the shutter button, the camera control button to open whatever So, I have

449
00:27:11,405 --> 00:27:15,165
Speaker 3:  a preview version of Allied that you can just open there. There's, you can

450
00:27:15,165 --> 00:27:18,565
Speaker 3:  change the button on the lock screen, you can set the action button to whatever

451
00:27:18,565 --> 00:27:22,165
Speaker 3:  you want, And. then you can still from the lock screen, just slide over to

452
00:27:22,165 --> 00:27:24,885
Speaker 3:  the right and open the stock camera. So by the end of this you'll be able

453
00:27:24,885 --> 00:27:27,245
Speaker 3:  to open four different cameras from the logs, cameras

454
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:27,845
Speaker 4:  Everywhere.

455
00:27:28,525 --> 00:27:32,165
Speaker 1:  A million ways in control center. You can, yeah. Anything the world is your

456
00:27:32,165 --> 00:27:34,885
Speaker 1:  oyster so you can tap on the back to open it like this. Yeah. Open.

457
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:38,445
Speaker 3:  And I'll say we, we are, we, you know, as everyone knows, our rule is you

458
00:27:38,445 --> 00:27:42,045
Speaker 3:  have to review what's in the box and you, you can't really talk about potential

459
00:27:42,045 --> 00:27:45,685
Speaker 3:  or future products. That's our longstanding rule. It is

460
00:27:46,195 --> 00:27:49,085
Speaker 3:  very obvious that one of the reasons you put a camera button like this on

461
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:52,485
Speaker 3:  the phone is so that when you do launch Apple intelligence and you have visual

462
00:27:52,485 --> 00:27:55,885
Speaker 3:  intelligence and the phone can look at stuff, right? You can just get to

463
00:27:55,885 --> 00:27:59,845
Speaker 3:  the camera as fast as possible or set one of these many ways to open the

464
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:02,885
Speaker 3:  camera to a regular camera and another one to an AI camera or whatever you

465
00:28:02,885 --> 00:28:06,445
Speaker 3:  wanna do. None of that stuff is shipping it. But you can see how Apple's

466
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:10,965
Speaker 3:  creating a lot of options for what the camera is doing, only one of which

467
00:28:10,965 --> 00:28:12,285
Speaker 3:  necessarily is taking a picture.

468
00:28:12,985 --> 00:28:16,535
Speaker 1:  Right. Okay. Does all the stuff you guys have been talking about

469
00:28:16,665 --> 00:28:20,615
Speaker 1:  apply to video as well? The, the styles, the defaults, some of the

470
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:24,095
Speaker 1:  same stuff. Like, I, I just thinking about this, 'cause I know with iOS 18,

471
00:28:24,175 --> 00:28:27,055
Speaker 1:  a lot of people get really excited about the thing where you can pause a

472
00:28:27,055 --> 00:28:29,895
Speaker 1:  video recording as you're going, which is such a small thing, but it's like,

473
00:28:30,365 --> 00:28:33,615
Speaker 1:  it's a useful reminder that like, oh, these are as much video cameras for

474
00:28:33,615 --> 00:28:37,455
Speaker 1:  people as they are. Anything else? What have you guys had with

475
00:28:37,455 --> 00:28:38,975
Speaker 1:  video so far? Any feelings?

476
00:28:40,335 --> 00:28:44,015
Speaker 4:  I, there is a new feature in the video

477
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:46,535
Speaker 4:  recording with a, I think it's called Audio mix,

478
00:28:47,665 --> 00:28:51,655
Speaker 4:  where after you record your clip you can go in and it's, it's one

479
00:28:51,655 --> 00:28:55,295
Speaker 4:  of those things that like 99% of people are not gonna find.

480
00:28:55,475 --> 00:28:59,255
Speaker 4:  But you go in and edit your video and you can mess with the

481
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:03,295
Speaker 4:  like audio channels and I can't, I can't keep them straight

482
00:29:03,295 --> 00:29:06,095
Speaker 4:  in my head. There's like in frame in studio

483
00:29:07,315 --> 00:29:11,295
Speaker 4:  and they just change how much of the like subject you hear and how

484
00:29:11,455 --> 00:29:15,415
Speaker 4:  much of the like background noise it tunes out. Or if I'm talking and

485
00:29:15,415 --> 00:29:19,095
Speaker 4:  like saying dumb stuff to my kid while he's playing, like I can just

486
00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:22,695
Speaker 4:  like erase that now and just hear him, which is ideal.

487
00:29:23,155 --> 00:29:23,735
Speaker 1:  That's cool.

488
00:29:24,045 --> 00:29:27,695
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah. So I've been playing with that a little bit and I, I always

489
00:29:27,695 --> 00:29:31,455
Speaker 4:  forget how nice like the cinematic video is on the

490
00:29:31,455 --> 00:29:35,335
Speaker 4:  iPhone, like even the regular iPhone. It's like kind of wild

491
00:29:35,405 --> 00:29:39,095
Speaker 4:  that you get that from this seven nine nine phone. So

492
00:29:39,485 --> 00:29:43,095
Speaker 3:  Yeah. So I've been shooting the review video with our video team with

493
00:29:43,335 --> 00:29:47,215
Speaker 3:  Veen, our supervising producer. We tested audio mix on

494
00:29:47,215 --> 00:29:51,175
Speaker 3:  a, in a street festival in New York City and it held up really, it

495
00:29:51,175 --> 00:29:54,655
Speaker 3:  wasn't perfect. You can watch the video but it holds up, which is remarkable.

496
00:29:55,115 --> 00:29:59,055
Speaker 3:  And that's 'cause they've added four studio quality mike's to

497
00:29:59,055 --> 00:30:02,815
Speaker 3:  the iPhone, which is interesting. They record

498
00:30:02,925 --> 00:30:06,735
Speaker 3:  spatial audio as well. But if they're really there for this

499
00:30:06,735 --> 00:30:10,575
Speaker 3:  audio mix feature. And so If, you If you play the video

500
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:14,415
Speaker 3:  back on an Apple tv, it plays in 5.1 surround sound for some reason,

501
00:30:14,685 --> 00:30:15,735
Speaker 3:  like not at now.

502
00:30:15,735 --> 00:30:16,975
Speaker 1:  Your kid can sneak up on you.

503
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:20,575
Speaker 3:  It's just like, what is going on here? Your videos If, you airplay it, it's

504
00:30:20,575 --> 00:30:24,335
Speaker 3:  only in stereo, but If, you somehow get the file to an Apple TV airplay through

505
00:30:24,335 --> 00:30:28,135
Speaker 3:  photos or whatever. You get five phone surround, which is like a crazy thing

506
00:30:28,135 --> 00:30:30,295
Speaker 3:  for a phone to be able to do. But it's all,

507
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:33,215
Speaker 1:  I live a surround sound video that I'm going to watch vertically on my phone.

508
00:30:33,285 --> 00:30:34,095
Speaker 1:  Like yeah,

509
00:30:34,095 --> 00:30:37,935
Speaker 3:  Perfect. It's, it took a long time. Port

510
00:30:38,395 --> 00:30:41,735
Speaker 3:  the people at Apple, like I have a number of surround sign questions and

511
00:30:41,735 --> 00:30:44,855
Speaker 3:  they're like, okay, like this is gonna take us a long time to get through.

512
00:30:45,755 --> 00:30:49,495
Speaker 3:  So that's cool And. then, you know, the pro, the big feature is 4K one 20

513
00:30:49,555 --> 00:30:53,255
Speaker 3:  and shooting 4K one 20 in log and you can attach all these extra external

514
00:30:53,275 --> 00:30:57,095
Speaker 3:  drives. And Veen had the time of his life doing this and he came

515
00:30:57,095 --> 00:31:00,895
Speaker 3:  away being like, this is fun. But one of the weirdest

516
00:31:00,895 --> 00:31:04,495
Speaker 3:  pieces of this puzzle is that it's still an iPhone. It's like an

517
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:08,055
Speaker 3:  incredibly personal device tied to an iCloud

518
00:31:08,055 --> 00:31:11,855
Speaker 3:  account that wants you to upgrade storage all the, like all the stuff.

519
00:31:12,635 --> 00:31:16,615
Speaker 3:  And using it as a professional video camera is starting to run right up

520
00:31:16,615 --> 00:31:20,495
Speaker 3:  against the fact that it's a phone, it's a phone meant for a person. Right?

521
00:31:20,495 --> 00:31:24,375
Speaker 3:  It's, this isn't like a utility. Like at our office we have a

522
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:28,055
Speaker 3:  gear room where video producers from across the company, like check out cameras.

523
00:31:28,605 --> 00:31:32,455
Speaker 3:  They're not like tied to their iCloud accounts. And so like you're just in

524
00:31:32,615 --> 00:31:35,695
Speaker 3:  this place where this phone is getting in Incre becoming an incredibly powerful

525
00:31:35,695 --> 00:31:39,535
Speaker 3:  video camera, but the way the software thinks about it is

526
00:31:39,535 --> 00:31:43,375
Speaker 3:  still as one person's phone. And you're just kind of like running into that

527
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:46,895
Speaker 3:  reality. I think, I think Apple will find some way to solve it. It's obvious

528
00:31:46,895 --> 00:31:50,175
Speaker 3:  they want people to use this as video cameras, but it that one context,

529
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:54,695
Speaker 3:  it's like, do you want install game center? And it's like, why, why do

530
00:31:54,775 --> 00:31:55,535
Speaker 3:  I don't actually

531
00:31:57,115 --> 00:32:00,455
Speaker 4:  You're shooting the weekend, there's, you know, a music video and

532
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:03,935
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And it, it's like you're getting an Rrc s message now it's like, I

533
00:32:03,935 --> 00:32:04,855
Speaker 3:  don't wanna do any of this.

534
00:32:05,135 --> 00:32:09,055
Speaker 1:  Right. Fair enough. Okay. So the,

535
00:32:09,155 --> 00:32:12,695
Speaker 1:  the last thing I'm curious about is whether this has brought up any,

536
00:32:13,005 --> 00:32:16,975
Speaker 1:  what is a photo apocalypse feelings from both of you? It doesn't seem

537
00:32:16,975 --> 00:32:20,535
Speaker 1:  like Apple has done much of the, like, here's some wacky

538
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,855
Speaker 1:  editing stuff you can do that is either very cool or the end of truth in

539
00:32:24,055 --> 00:32:27,935
Speaker 1:  humanity in the world. What has been your experience so far? Have

540
00:32:27,935 --> 00:32:30,375
Speaker 1:  you had any of these feelings run across any of this stuff?

541
00:32:30,975 --> 00:32:34,815
Speaker 4:  I, in my experience is a weird one because I more or less

542
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:39,015
Speaker 4:  came over from the Pixel nine. I was doing all those reviews and picking

543
00:32:39,085 --> 00:32:39,485
Speaker 4:  up this,

544
00:32:39,485 --> 00:32:40,685
Speaker 1:  Which is a full on what is a photo

545
00:32:40,685 --> 00:32:44,125
Speaker 4:  Apocalypse? Yeah. It's just so beyond what is a photo

546
00:32:44,785 --> 00:32:48,685
Speaker 4:  And then picking this up. I'm like, oh, I'm playing with sliders. Like I

547
00:32:48,685 --> 00:32:52,525
Speaker 4:  am, I'm dialing in like saturation and contrast. It's like just such

548
00:32:52,565 --> 00:32:55,245
Speaker 4:  a wildly different experience and I,

549
00:32:56,515 --> 00:33:00,445
Speaker 4:  yeah, I, I'm digging it, but I haven't had anything, you know,

550
00:33:00,655 --> 00:33:03,885
Speaker 4:  throw me into a, a whirlwind of what is reality

551
00:33:04,585 --> 00:33:04,925
Speaker 4:  for sure.

552
00:33:04,995 --> 00:33:08,525
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I will say I've been using a pixel line and as part of this review

553
00:33:08,525 --> 00:33:11,965
Speaker 3:  and also an S 24 Ultra and both of those phones are like ai, do you wanna

554
00:33:11,965 --> 00:33:14,805
Speaker 3:  do some ai? Like you pick up a, a pixel line, you open the camera and it's

555
00:33:14,805 --> 00:33:17,285
Speaker 3:  like, are you ready to make some weird stuff with me?

556
00:33:19,385 --> 00:33:23,085
Speaker 3:  And there's like very And then this, this phone is not that. Apple is releasing

557
00:33:23,185 --> 00:33:26,045
Speaker 3:  one feature with Apple intelligence, a feature called cleanup, which is basically

558
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:29,885
Speaker 3:  magic eraser that lets you take stuff out. So we'll see how that works and

559
00:33:29,885 --> 00:33:32,485
Speaker 3:  we'll see if that causes any particular, what is a, a photo

560
00:33:33,335 --> 00:33:37,005
Speaker 3:  apocalypse thoughts. But I think Apple is gonna play it pretty

561
00:33:37,195 --> 00:33:41,165
Speaker 3:  safe. I I spent some time with John McCormick who is the

562
00:33:41,545 --> 00:33:45,445
Speaker 3:  VP of camera software engineering at Apple every year. He and

563
00:33:45,445 --> 00:33:48,325
Speaker 3:  I have like an existential dilemma about photography together

564
00:33:49,265 --> 00:33:52,965
Speaker 3:  and I basically asked him to respond to the pixel team at Google

565
00:33:53,045 --> 00:33:55,965
Speaker 3:  saying they now make memories instead of photos. Right. Which they said in

566
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:59,805
Speaker 3:  a wired piece and So I, like what's a photo? And so here's what he told me,

567
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:02,165
Speaker 3:  he answered, I've got John McCormack from Apple

568
00:34:03,235 --> 00:34:06,245
Speaker 3:  answering the question, what is a photo in Apple's mind? So here's the quote,

569
00:34:06,515 --> 00:34:10,285
Speaker 3:  it's long, I apologize. Here's our view of what a

570
00:34:10,285 --> 00:34:14,005
Speaker 3:  photograph is. The way we like to think of it is it's a personal celebration

571
00:34:14,005 --> 00:34:17,325
Speaker 3:  of something that really actually happened. Whether that's a simple thing,

572
00:34:17,325 --> 00:34:20,725
Speaker 3:  like a fancy cup of coffee that I had that's got some cool design on it all

573
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:24,525
Speaker 3:  the way through to my kids' first steps or my parents' last breath. It is

574
00:34:24,525 --> 00:34:27,165
Speaker 3:  something that really happened and it's something that is a marker in my

575
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:30,905
Speaker 3:  life and it's something that deserves to be celebrated. That's the

576
00:34:31,145 --> 00:34:32,065
Speaker 3:  answer. It happened

577
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:36,905
Speaker 1:  Deserves to be celebrated is a really weird

578
00:34:37,915 --> 00:34:41,265
Speaker 1:  place to end that thought. But I think the, like,

579
00:34:42,245 --> 00:34:45,865
Speaker 1:  it, it is a, a personal celebration of something that really actually happened.

580
00:34:45,865 --> 00:34:49,425
Speaker 1:  Something that really actually happened is like a, a, a thing I wholeheartedly

581
00:34:49,585 --> 00:34:51,865
Speaker 1:  agree with. So I'm just gonna focus on that. That feels good.

582
00:34:52,305 --> 00:34:56,185
Speaker 3:  I think this is tied to why they, why they are so intent

583
00:34:56,445 --> 00:35:00,145
Speaker 3:  on bringing up the shadows and dropping the highlights and

584
00:35:00,175 --> 00:35:03,705
Speaker 3:  capturing all of the detail and solving the backlit photo.

585
00:35:04,225 --> 00:35:07,185
Speaker 3:  Hmm. Right. They're like, we are gonna get a photo of this,

586
00:35:08,945 --> 00:35:12,865
Speaker 3:  whatever it's Right. And that I I think Celebr I agree with

587
00:35:12,865 --> 00:35:16,385
Speaker 3:  you, celebration's an odd word, but I, I think what they mean of it is like

588
00:35:16,385 --> 00:35:17,905
Speaker 3:  they need to honor the the moment

589
00:35:19,065 --> 00:35:19,385
Speaker 1:  I see,

590
00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:22,225
Speaker 3:  Right. Like that I've been, I've been puzzling over this quote since you

591
00:35:22,225 --> 00:35:26,065
Speaker 3:  said it to me. And I, that's what I've gotten to is like, I

592
00:35:26,065 --> 00:35:29,985
Speaker 3:  think that's why this camera is so aggressive at so many of the

593
00:35:29,985 --> 00:35:33,945
Speaker 3:  things it does because Apple is, they do not want to be in the hook for,

594
00:35:34,525 --> 00:35:38,085
Speaker 3:  it was the birthday party and you all stood in front of the window and everyone's

595
00:35:38,085 --> 00:35:42,045
Speaker 3:  face was in shadows. Right. And the window is bright white, right. Like that

596
00:35:42,045 --> 00:35:45,285
Speaker 3:  is a photo lots of people have taken by accident and Apple is not gonna let

597
00:35:45,285 --> 00:35:48,605
Speaker 3:  that happen. Yeah. And I, you know, none of the phone manufacturers are gonna

598
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:52,125
Speaker 3:  let that happen anymore. They're all chasing that same idea, which is we

599
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:54,645
Speaker 3:  are gonna get this, we are gonna make this photo happen.

600
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:55,725
Speaker 1:  Right.

601
00:35:55,835 --> 00:35:59,405
Speaker 3:  Like, and it's just, it it's gotten to like a set of aesthetic trade offs

602
00:35:59,405 --> 00:36:01,645
Speaker 3:  that I personally think is weird. It sounds like Allison, you, you might

603
00:36:01,645 --> 00:36:02,685
Speaker 3:  think shadows are good too,

604
00:36:04,465 --> 00:36:08,205
Speaker 3:  but I Yeah, when I, I've been thinking about the word

605
00:36:08,205 --> 00:36:11,525
Speaker 3:  celebration here for a minute. I I think that's what that means, right? Like

606
00:36:12,265 --> 00:36:15,885
Speaker 3:  the, the taking of the photo as a real moment that we were not gonna screw

607
00:36:15,885 --> 00:36:19,685
Speaker 3:  up and it actually happened. I'm curious, right, whether

608
00:36:20,435 --> 00:36:23,925
Speaker 3:  over time the competitors who are less

609
00:36:23,935 --> 00:36:27,885
Speaker 3:  idealistic push Apple off this position, you can already see it with some

610
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:31,165
Speaker 3:  of the aggressive processing they've done in response to Samsung in other

611
00:36:31,165 --> 00:36:31,525
Speaker 3:  markets,

612
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:36,165
Speaker 3:  beautification filters and things like that are much more prevalent and much

613
00:36:36,165 --> 00:36:39,405
Speaker 3:  more accepted in markets like China. Apple hasn't gotten all the way that

614
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:42,685
Speaker 3:  far, but they're starting to let people do it right in in different ways.

615
00:36:42,685 --> 00:36:45,325
Speaker 3:  They're, they're starting to let go because that is the competitive pressure.

616
00:36:45,785 --> 00:36:48,445
Speaker 3:  If Google starts selling a lot of pixel phones, 'cause you can just add weed

617
00:36:48,445 --> 00:36:52,405
Speaker 3:  to every photo by, by literally writing ad weed to photo. Like who

618
00:36:52,405 --> 00:36:55,045
Speaker 3:  knows what's gonna happen. Yeah. But that's where they're starting today.

619
00:36:55,045 --> 00:36:58,885
Speaker 3:  And I think cleanup is like a little bit off of that. But his other point

620
00:36:58,885 --> 00:37:02,445
Speaker 3:  to me was they only do things that are rooted in photographic tradition and

621
00:37:02,465 --> 00:37:05,045
Speaker 3:  taking stuff outta the background at this point is pretty much a part of

622
00:37:05,045 --> 00:37:06,205
Speaker 3:  photo photographic tradition.

623
00:37:07,455 --> 00:37:10,975
Speaker 1:  I mean that's fair. I I think I buy that thesis. It does seem like a pretty

624
00:37:11,135 --> 00:37:14,985
Speaker 1:  slippery slope from that sort of honorable

625
00:37:15,225 --> 00:37:18,705
Speaker 1:  starting point. I think that is like we are, we are going to get the thing

626
00:37:18,725 --> 00:37:22,425
Speaker 1:  you wanted to get damn the shadows and the aesthetics, right? Like

627
00:37:22,565 --> 00:37:25,465
Speaker 1:  you're, you're gonna see all the faces in that backlit photo, even if it

628
00:37:25,465 --> 00:37:28,105
Speaker 1:  makes everything else look like trash because the thing you wanted was the

629
00:37:28,105 --> 00:37:31,865
Speaker 1:  faces. I actually think that's like a reasonable place to be,

630
00:37:32,685 --> 00:37:36,625
Speaker 1:  but then it, it does cause lots of trade-offs and I think to your

631
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:40,585
Speaker 1:  point about like face filters and all this stuff, like Apple has seemed

632
00:37:40,685 --> 00:37:43,265
Speaker 1:  to start coming to this place where they're like, we're gonna let you do

633
00:37:43,265 --> 00:37:46,785
Speaker 1:  it. We're not gonna make it super easy. But If you want to do it If you want

634
00:37:46,785 --> 00:37:48,505
Speaker 1:  to just nasty up your home screen.

635
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:49,265
Speaker 3:  Yeah,

636
00:37:49,405 --> 00:37:53,385
Speaker 1:  You can now. Exactly. You can now. We don't want you to, but you super

637
00:37:53,525 --> 00:37:57,025
Speaker 1:  can now and, and there is definitely a thing that Apple is like, look, If

638
00:37:57,025 --> 00:38:00,985
Speaker 1:  you If you wanna ruin it, you can. That's on you dog.

639
00:38:01,305 --> 00:38:04,985
Speaker 1:  Like, and I think to some extent I think that's actually the right approach.

640
00:38:04,985 --> 00:38:08,025
Speaker 1:  But it's, it's interesting to see how far Apple will go

641
00:38:08,735 --> 00:38:12,185
Speaker 1:  with that approach and just basically be like, we didn't do it. We just let

642
00:38:12,185 --> 00:38:15,545
Speaker 1:  you do it. Which is very unapply and very

643
00:38:16,465 --> 00:38:18,985
Speaker 1:  interesting to watch as it tries to figure all of this out.

644
00:38:19,265 --> 00:38:22,825
Speaker 3:  I do think one of the reasons Apple hasn't gone into full, what is a photo

645
00:38:22,825 --> 00:38:26,785
Speaker 3:  apocalypse territory is that there's no like meaningful at

646
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:30,785
Speaker 3:  scale photo verification standard that works, right?

647
00:38:30,785 --> 00:38:34,385
Speaker 3:  There's C two PA, which literally the day we're recording Google said it's

648
00:38:34,385 --> 00:38:37,565
Speaker 3:  gonna support in search and ads but not put in Android.

649
00:38:38,905 --> 00:38:42,885
Speaker 3:  So this idea that you can like take a photo and have it verify

650
00:38:42,885 --> 00:38:46,525
Speaker 3:  that this was a real photo that happened and you know, track the chain of

651
00:38:46,535 --> 00:38:50,085
Speaker 3:  edits and know whether it was AI generated or not. And that's like

652
00:38:50,085 --> 00:38:54,005
Speaker 3:  cryptographically in the metadata. That's a big idea. There's a

653
00:38:54,005 --> 00:38:57,445
Speaker 3:  lot of companies signed up to make that idea work. Apple is not one of those

654
00:38:57,685 --> 00:39:00,205
Speaker 3:  companies yet. And I, I think their point of view is we, we don't wanna adopt

655
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:02,405
Speaker 3:  this until we know it's gonna work and it's worth it. And it's actually the

656
00:39:02,405 --> 00:39:04,725
Speaker 3:  thing that we wanna tie ourselves to because it is the most popular camera

657
00:39:04,725 --> 00:39:08,205
Speaker 3:  in the world. So, I think if they can solve that problem or the industry

658
00:39:08,205 --> 00:39:12,125
Speaker 3:  can solve that problem, which who knows big open question.

659
00:39:12,685 --> 00:39:16,485
Speaker 3:  I think that gives all these companies more freedom to, to let you do all

660
00:39:16,485 --> 00:39:20,045
Speaker 3:  kinds of wacky AI stuff. But I think you have to solve that problem first.

661
00:39:20,845 --> 00:39:23,255
Speaker 1:  Yeah, that makes sense to me. All right, last thing And, then we gotta take

662
00:39:23,255 --> 00:39:24,655
Speaker 1:  a break. Battery life

663
00:39:26,725 --> 00:39:30,575
Speaker 1:  full last week of feces about best battery

664
00:39:30,575 --> 00:39:33,695
Speaker 1:  life ever. That didn't mean anything and didn't even have graphs that didn't

665
00:39:33,695 --> 00:39:36,775
Speaker 1:  mean anything. Just a lot of open-ended statements about battery life.

666
00:39:37,645 --> 00:39:41,415
Speaker 1:  Have either of you noticed any new changes in the

667
00:39:41,415 --> 00:39:43,535
Speaker 1:  battery life of your iPhone in your testing so far?

668
00:39:44,135 --> 00:39:47,655
Speaker 4:  I, I mean I'll say it's good but it's not like it's,

669
00:39:48,355 --> 00:39:52,135
Speaker 4:  you can't get two days out of an iPhone battery all of a sudden.

670
00:39:52,205 --> 00:39:56,175
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's just sort of like, yeah, I think this is it. It keeps

671
00:39:56,195 --> 00:39:59,815
Speaker 4:  up with me all day. I can do a whole bunch of stuff and stream the

672
00:39:59,945 --> 00:40:03,655
Speaker 4:  radio station and do GPS and, and it's

673
00:40:03,765 --> 00:40:07,655
Speaker 4:  okay. It's, I think the question in on

674
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:11,615
Speaker 4:  our minds is like, how is this gonna perform in the long run? Like

675
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:15,375
Speaker 4:  the 15 pro has been kind of notorious for running

676
00:40:15,405 --> 00:40:18,855
Speaker 4:  down the battery health, like Yep. Alarmingly fast. So

677
00:40:19,445 --> 00:40:23,375
Speaker 4:  yeah, it's, it's like TBD it's fine now on the 16 and

678
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:27,215
Speaker 4:  the 16 plus you can just like add 30% to

679
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:30,495
Speaker 4:  like, it'll go that much more 'cause it's just massive.

680
00:40:31,555 --> 00:40:33,295
Speaker 4:  But that's been my experience.

681
00:40:33,925 --> 00:40:37,895
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I I have the same general experience, the 16 Pro Max,

682
00:40:37,895 --> 00:40:40,855
Speaker 3:  which is a huge phone by the way. Yeah. It has bigger battery in it

683
00:40:42,075 --> 00:40:46,015
Speaker 3:  and it runs longer. I mean, I've had the camera open and the screen on shooting

684
00:40:46,015 --> 00:40:49,575
Speaker 3:  this video, the, the whole week basically. It's fine. It's, it's doing its

685
00:40:49,575 --> 00:40:52,855
Speaker 3:  job but my 15 pro doesn't make it through the day anymore. And so

686
00:40:53,645 --> 00:40:56,855
Speaker 3:  does a brand new phone make it through the day? Yes. I think that is the

687
00:40:56,855 --> 00:40:59,975
Speaker 3:  case for every brand new phone, right. Six months from now or a year from

688
00:40:59,975 --> 00:41:03,935
Speaker 3:  now when you're still looking at your $1,400 investment. Is it gonna,

689
00:41:04,475 --> 00:41:08,415
Speaker 3:  is it gonna survive? And I I we have to find out, I think Apple is actually

690
00:41:08,415 --> 00:41:12,335
Speaker 3:  on a bad run of this. I think the 14 pro was bad and the 15 pro was

691
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:13,895
Speaker 3:  bad and I'm hoping the 16 pro is better.

692
00:41:14,245 --> 00:41:17,655
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I agree. And e even in the best case scenario, it feels like we're

693
00:41:17,655 --> 00:41:21,535
Speaker 1:  still very much at, you can use your phone all day, but you should probably

694
00:41:21,535 --> 00:41:24,415
Speaker 1:  charge it every night. And until we're past that,

695
00:41:25,365 --> 00:41:28,075
Speaker 1:  don't, don't give me big speeches about battery life.

696
00:41:28,215 --> 00:41:30,155
Speaker 3:  Oh no, I'm in a, I'm in a different spot entirely.

697
00:41:30,815 --> 00:41:31,155
Speaker 1:  Are you?

698
00:41:31,305 --> 00:41:35,205
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I'm at until I don't have to leave my house with

699
00:41:35,205 --> 00:41:37,725
Speaker 3:  a little MagSafe battery, don't talk to me.

700
00:41:38,025 --> 00:41:38,805
Speaker 1:  Oh wow. Right.

701
00:41:38,805 --> 00:41:41,285
Speaker 3:  That's where I'm at with the 15 pro. I leave the house with a battery pack

702
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:45,325
Speaker 3:  or I put it into low power mode. Right. And that battery's only at 93%

703
00:41:45,325 --> 00:41:47,485
Speaker 3:  according to iOS. That's

704
00:41:47,485 --> 00:41:48,085
Speaker 1:  Pretty bad. I

705
00:41:48,085 --> 00:41:50,245
Speaker 3:  Know people who are down in the eighties or after a year.

706
00:41:50,585 --> 00:41:54,045
Speaker 1:  I'm at, I'm at 89. Last I checked a few days ago. Yeah, it's pretty bad.

707
00:41:54,425 --> 00:41:54,645
Speaker 1:  And

708
00:41:54,665 --> 00:41:57,765
Speaker 3:  You know this all this depends, it's impossible to measure like If, you stay

709
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:01,165
Speaker 3:  at home on wifi, okay these batteries are great, right? The second you leave

710
00:42:01,165 --> 00:42:04,445
Speaker 3:  the house, you go into like three or four challenging cell environments.

711
00:42:04,465 --> 00:42:07,645
Speaker 3:  If, you take the subway, you phone's, hunting between stations for signal,

712
00:42:08,005 --> 00:42:11,765
Speaker 3:  like you're gonna run the battery on faster. So the idea that it is just

713
00:42:11,765 --> 00:42:15,725
Speaker 3:  better is probably true in the beginning. You're gonna have a radically different

714
00:42:15,725 --> 00:42:19,645
Speaker 3:  experience and I think Apple's challenge now is maintaining battery health

715
00:42:19,715 --> 00:42:23,365
Speaker 3:  over time. Especially because the battery replacements on these phones are

716
00:42:23,365 --> 00:42:25,245
Speaker 3:  more expensive than they're, than they were before. Right.

717
00:42:25,245 --> 00:42:28,605
Speaker 1:  Yeah. All right, well we'll see, I think this is going to be a particularly

718
00:42:28,745 --> 00:42:32,605
Speaker 1:  fun generation of iPhones to come back to in six months because

719
00:42:32,835 --> 00:42:33,965
Speaker 1:  like you're saying, 'cause all the

720
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:34,405
Speaker 3:  Software will

721
00:42:34,405 --> 00:42:37,925
Speaker 1:  Change, all the software will change. Literally. It's possible that the whole

722
00:42:37,925 --> 00:42:41,765
Speaker 1:  like value prop of an iPhone will change if Apple is right about what

723
00:42:41,765 --> 00:42:43,165
Speaker 1:  all of this stuff can do. Particularly

724
00:42:43,165 --> 00:42:43,685
Speaker 3:  For the 16.

725
00:42:43,865 --> 00:42:44,965
Speaker 1:  That's what I mean. Yeah, because

726
00:42:45,035 --> 00:42:47,405
Speaker 3:  Then it, then it becomes the one that you're supposed to upgrade to. And

727
00:42:47,405 --> 00:42:50,445
Speaker 3:  I, I just dunno. By the way, speaking of battery life, we have no idea what

728
00:42:50,445 --> 00:42:52,965
Speaker 3:  the effect of Apple intelligence and battery life will be. Right. Here's

729
00:42:52,965 --> 00:42:55,805
Speaker 3:  a bunch of stuff that might just be running in the background summarizing

730
00:42:55,805 --> 00:42:59,525
Speaker 3:  everything on your phone at all times. and we don't know the Apple intelligence

731
00:42:59,525 --> 00:43:02,525
Speaker 3:  goes to the cloud, right? The private cloud compute for a bunch of stuff.

732
00:43:02,785 --> 00:43:06,365
Speaker 3:  Yep. It's gonna run your radios and a bunch of moments and we don't know

733
00:43:06,365 --> 00:43:08,965
Speaker 3:  when or how like we're gonna find out.

734
00:43:09,555 --> 00:43:12,325
Speaker 1:  Yeah, fair enough. Alright, we gotta take a break. Allison, you're gonna

735
00:43:12,325 --> 00:43:15,005
Speaker 1:  come back in a little while 'cause we have one more thing to do on the show,

736
00:43:15,745 --> 00:43:18,325
Speaker 1:  but thank you both Godspeed, finishing your reviews.

737
00:43:18,975 --> 00:43:19,445
Speaker 3:  Thank you.

738
00:43:19,865 --> 00:43:20,885
Speaker 1:  Thanks guys. Later.

739
00:43:21,115 --> 00:43:21,605
Speaker 3:  Alright,

740
00:43:21,605 --> 00:43:24,085
Speaker 1:  We gotta take a break And then we're gonna come back and we're gonna talk

741
00:43:24,165 --> 00:43:26,885
Speaker 1:  Apple watch and we're gonna talk AirPods. We'll be right back.

742
00:45:55,765 --> 00:45:57,365
Speaker 7:  material? Is that new? Yeah. Yeah.

743
00:45:58,665 --> 00:46:01,445
Speaker 1:  But So I think for the most part here, we should probably talk about the

744
00:46:01,445 --> 00:46:04,965
Speaker 1:  series 10 because I think that is, that is the one with actual sort of new

745
00:46:04,965 --> 00:46:05,725
Speaker 1:  stuff going on.

746
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:07,565
Speaker 7:  Some newness is is happening.

747
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:11,725
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So let's start with the outside of it because there, I just

748
00:46:11,725 --> 00:46:15,605
Speaker 1:  can't get over this video that like, it's still seared into my brain all

749
00:46:15,605 --> 00:46:19,565
Speaker 1:  week of just this like very long pan shot down the watch

750
00:46:19,595 --> 00:46:23,405
Speaker 1:  band and it's like, okay, sure we, this is a thing. But anyway,

751
00:46:23,705 --> 00:46:27,465
Speaker 1:  how is it? It's, it's thinner, it's bigger. What's the verdict?

752
00:46:27,815 --> 00:46:31,745
Speaker 7:  It's thinner and bigger and lighter, which you know that that is a thing.

753
00:46:31,745 --> 00:46:34,025
Speaker 1:  Those are good things. I like all those things. Right? Those

754
00:46:34,025 --> 00:46:37,825
Speaker 7:  Are good things. Those are good design choices. It's just

755
00:46:37,885 --> 00:46:41,425
Speaker 7:  If, you know what an Apple watch looks like. No

756
00:46:41,485 --> 00:46:45,025
Speaker 7:  amount of adjectives is going to really, you know,

757
00:46:46,205 --> 00:46:49,425
Speaker 7:  change the fact that it looks like an Apple watch. It looks like, okay, all

758
00:46:49,425 --> 00:46:52,345
Speaker 7:  the Apple Watch, like, you know, when we were in the theater and he's like

759
00:46:52,425 --> 00:46:56,345
Speaker 7:  a design that you've never seen before. It's like, I Gretchen form you.

760
00:46:56,465 --> 00:46:59,865
Speaker 7:  I have seen this design before. It is just been tweaked. Okay.

761
00:47:00,175 --> 00:47:04,145
Speaker 7:  They're very nice tweaks. I'm not trying to disparage the tweaks. It

762
00:47:04,245 --> 00:47:08,225
Speaker 7:  is, I will say there has been, even though there is like a,

763
00:47:08,305 --> 00:47:12,185
Speaker 7:  a, a thinning of the watch, like it is a lot thinner, you know, take

764
00:47:12,225 --> 00:47:15,905
Speaker 7:  a lot with a grain of salt. It's 9.7 millimeters that is quite thin for smart

765
00:47:15,905 --> 00:47:19,625
Speaker 7:  watches. Generally we see them in the 11 to 13 millimeter

766
00:47:19,625 --> 00:47:23,505
Speaker 7:  range, sometimes 14, 15 if they're chunkers. So that is

767
00:47:23,505 --> 00:47:26,905
Speaker 7:  quite thin. I'm not, I'm not trying to say that that's not a a thing, but

768
00:47:27,685 --> 00:47:31,485
Speaker 7:  I'm just saying it's, it's the, there has also been an in

769
00:47:31,485 --> 00:47:35,205
Speaker 7:  beginning of it, because you know, when the first Apple Watch came

770
00:47:35,265 --> 00:47:38,845
Speaker 7:  out back in 20 14, 20 15, it was 38

771
00:47:39,085 --> 00:47:42,765
Speaker 7:  millimeters and 42 millimeters. Now we are at 42 millimeters and

772
00:47:42,765 --> 00:47:46,685
Speaker 7:  46 millimeters. So the small watch has become what

773
00:47:46,685 --> 00:47:48,925
Speaker 7:  was the biggest watch back in the day. It's

774
00:47:48,925 --> 00:47:51,685
Speaker 1:  The, I mean this is, this is what happens, right? This is like the iPhone

775
00:47:51,695 --> 00:47:55,405
Speaker 1:  intonating of Yes. The whole thing. This is, this is how it goes.

776
00:47:55,615 --> 00:47:59,525
Speaker 7:  There is like a, a real sense that it's, you know, we're 10

777
00:47:59,525 --> 00:48:02,805
Speaker 7:  years into the Apple Watch there is like an iPhone ification of it. Yeah.

778
00:48:02,805 --> 00:48:06,765
Speaker 7:  And, and that they're facing similar problems now where the updates

779
00:48:06,765 --> 00:48:10,445
Speaker 7:  every year are iterative and like sometimes they feel very

780
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:14,485
Speaker 7:  iterative. Like, Ooh, I think I saw someone online say this

781
00:48:14,485 --> 00:48:17,645
Speaker 7:  about both the phone and the watches. But it really feels like an S year

782
00:48:17,945 --> 00:48:21,525
Speaker 7:  and yeah, it does, it does feel like an S year in some ways. And I think

783
00:48:21,525 --> 00:48:25,245
Speaker 7:  people were hoping for more of like a big jump of a year. Okay.

784
00:48:25,245 --> 00:48:28,725
Speaker 1:  But I will say, and this is, this is the thing about the little hardware

785
00:48:28,725 --> 00:48:32,405
Speaker 1:  changes that I'm most curious about is the sort of

786
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:36,365
Speaker 1:  ideal watch. Screen size seems to be

787
00:48:36,365 --> 00:48:40,325
Speaker 1:  bigger, while the ideal watch size seems to be smaller,

788
00:48:40,705 --> 00:48:41,325
Speaker 1:  at least for me

789
00:48:42,035 --> 00:48:44,005
Speaker 7:  There's a lot of min maxing happening.

790
00:48:44,355 --> 00:48:48,125
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And so what I wonder is with this one, does it feel like Apple

791
00:48:48,185 --> 00:48:51,445
Speaker 1:  has gotten closer? I know you have kind of a tortured relationship with the

792
00:48:51,445 --> 00:48:52,925
Speaker 1:  sizes of smart watches over the years.

793
00:48:53,165 --> 00:48:53,645
Speaker 7:  I really do.

794
00:48:54,085 --> 00:48:57,645
Speaker 1:  But I'm very curious if it feels like this one If, you can make it

795
00:48:58,165 --> 00:49:01,965
Speaker 1:  a little bigger but a little thinner and a little lighter, maybe it'll still

796
00:49:01,965 --> 00:49:05,325
Speaker 1:  feel smaller despite being bigger. And maybe that's the right

797
00:49:05,515 --> 00:49:06,525
Speaker 1:  combination of things.

798
00:49:06,965 --> 00:49:10,765
Speaker 7:  I think they're onto something. Okay. I, whether people appreciate that

799
00:49:10,945 --> 00:49:14,245
Speaker 7:  is gonna be a different thing. But you know, I am wearing the 42

800
00:49:14,605 --> 00:49:17,885
Speaker 7:  millimeter 'cause they sent me the smaller size. 'cause I am the smaller

801
00:49:17,885 --> 00:49:21,845
Speaker 7:  person. So I have the 42 millimeter series 10.

802
00:49:21,845 --> 00:49:22,285
Speaker 7:  Which do

803
00:49:22,285 --> 00:49:25,325
Speaker 1:  You think is like the default size by the way? Like I feel like when it was

804
00:49:25,325 --> 00:49:29,085
Speaker 1:  38 and 42, I think most people bought 42. But now that it's 42 and 46

805
00:49:29,745 --> 00:49:32,565
Speaker 1:  If, you just pure off the top of your head, guess which would you think is

806
00:49:32,565 --> 00:49:33,885
Speaker 1:  like the main one people have?

807
00:49:34,285 --> 00:49:37,085
Speaker 7:  I would think the 42 to be quite honest because I think that's

808
00:49:37,085 --> 00:49:37,565
Speaker 1:  Where I'm at too.

809
00:49:37,835 --> 00:49:41,685
Speaker 7:  It's quite impressive. So actually the 46

810
00:49:42,005 --> 00:49:45,805
Speaker 7:  millimeter series 10 has the largest display area of any

811
00:49:45,805 --> 00:49:48,605
Speaker 7:  Apple Watch. And that is including the Ultra,

812
00:49:48,605 --> 00:49:49,765
Speaker 1:  Which is nuts. Which

813
00:49:49,765 --> 00:49:53,125
Speaker 7:  Is nuts when you think about it. Like truly the min maxing has happened here

814
00:49:53,275 --> 00:49:56,565
Speaker 7:  with with the four four, the 46 millimeter. And that's quite impressive

815
00:49:57,625 --> 00:50:01,565
Speaker 7:  and actually quite compelling to a lot of people who have ultras who don't

816
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:04,325
Speaker 7:  love the weight, me being one of them when I run.

817
00:50:05,385 --> 00:50:09,245
Speaker 7:  And you know like I love our Blurple band but the problem with the

818
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:12,805
Speaker 7:  Ral band is that my wrist is a little too small. So I have to wear it a little

819
00:50:12,805 --> 00:50:16,725
Speaker 7:  looser. So I really feel that drag when I'm running. That is

820
00:50:16,745 --> 00:50:20,445
Speaker 7:  not the case when you have a series 10, it is thinner and lighter. It

821
00:50:20,445 --> 00:50:23,885
Speaker 7:  feels like you're not really wearing quite as much when you go on a run.

822
00:50:23,905 --> 00:50:27,750
Speaker 7:  So I think for some people that will be quite compelling. Especially since

823
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:31,485
Speaker 7:  I do have the 42 millimeter and I right, right on the same wrist

824
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:35,285
Speaker 7:  right next to the, to the Ultra. I'm not really

825
00:50:35,285 --> 00:50:38,925
Speaker 7:  looking at that much smaller of a screen. So the 42 is slightly smaller

826
00:50:39,165 --> 00:50:42,805
Speaker 7:  I believe, than the Ultra, but not by much.

827
00:50:43,305 --> 00:50:43,965
Speaker 7:  Not by much.

828
00:50:44,385 --> 00:50:48,325
Speaker 1:  And I remember when the first ultra came out, we were talking about it and

829
00:50:48,325 --> 00:50:51,325
Speaker 1:  I think it was Neli who got really excited about it and he was like, let,

830
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:53,485
Speaker 1:  I'm just gonna love it with you. I'm not gonna use any of these features.

831
00:50:53,645 --> 00:50:56,645
Speaker 1:  I don't care about any of the outdoorsy nonsense. I'm going to sit on my

832
00:50:56,645 --> 00:51:00,205
Speaker 1:  couch and look at this huge screen and Apple Watch Ultra. And I think that's

833
00:51:00,205 --> 00:51:04,005
Speaker 1:  a lot of people. Right. And I think especially as we get to

834
00:51:04,165 --> 00:51:07,805
Speaker 1:  this thing where Apple is big on Glanceable information and it's an AI input

835
00:51:07,805 --> 00:51:11,205
Speaker 1:  output system, like I kind of get the appeal of like, how much screen can

836
00:51:11,205 --> 00:51:14,245
Speaker 1:  we put on your wrist before it feels bad? And it sounds like they've got

837
00:51:14,245 --> 00:51:17,765
Speaker 1:  that balance kind of right? Like does that forever change

838
00:51:18,425 --> 00:51:21,805
Speaker 1:  the appeal of an Apple watch? To most people it feels like, probably not.

839
00:51:22,965 --> 00:51:26,565
Speaker 7:  Probably not. But within the balance, like as far as wearability goes,

840
00:51:26,675 --> 00:51:30,565
Speaker 7:  like I, they did make some like meaningful, significant tweaks in

841
00:51:30,565 --> 00:51:34,525
Speaker 7:  terms of wearability especially, you know, part of the impetus to make these

842
00:51:34,715 --> 00:51:38,085
Speaker 7:  lighter and more comfortable and more wearable is, you know, sleep tracking.

843
00:51:38,445 --> 00:51:42,085
Speaker 7:  Sleep tracking has historically not been the Apple Watch like

844
00:51:42,085 --> 00:51:45,845
Speaker 7:  biggest strength. Just because one Battery life is not as impressive

845
00:51:45,865 --> 00:51:49,485
Speaker 7:  as other wearables in this category. Which, you know, they're addressing

846
00:51:49,485 --> 00:51:53,365
Speaker 7:  with faster charging but also comfort. Like I, I've been sleeping with

847
00:51:53,365 --> 00:51:56,685
Speaker 7:  the ultra too for the past year. It's not fun. It's, it's not what I would

848
00:51:56,685 --> 00:52:00,525
Speaker 7:  call the most comfortable smart watch to sleep with.

849
00:52:00,595 --> 00:52:04,445
Speaker 7:  It's, it's just not agreed. So you know, in that respect I've been

850
00:52:04,445 --> 00:52:07,925
Speaker 7:  wearing the series 10 to sleep and it's a lot more

851
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:11,525
Speaker 7:  comfortable than the ultra two. So, you know, sleep tracking is a thing that's

852
00:52:11,525 --> 00:52:15,405
Speaker 7:  important to you. That is a thing. It, there is a blurring of the lines now.

853
00:52:15,605 --> 00:52:19,165
Speaker 7:  'cause something that I've been thinking a lot about in the last couple of

854
00:52:19,165 --> 00:52:22,885
Speaker 7:  days is the electrification of the series 10. Hmm. Because it does

855
00:52:22,915 --> 00:52:26,445
Speaker 7:  feel like they were like hmm, there are certain things about the ultra that

856
00:52:26,475 --> 00:52:30,245
Speaker 7:  have really gotten people excited. Let's port that over

857
00:52:30,585 --> 00:52:34,285
Speaker 7:  to the series 10. So now you have people online just really confused

858
00:52:34,745 --> 00:52:38,725
Speaker 7:  as to like, should I ditch the ultra? Because

859
00:52:39,105 --> 00:52:42,925
Speaker 7:  as you said, some of these people are not athletes or not very like

860
00:52:43,075 --> 00:52:46,725
Speaker 7:  into the training aspect or like the outdoorsiness of of the

861
00:52:46,775 --> 00:52:50,485
Speaker 7:  ultra. So they don't need dual dual band GPS, they don't need

862
00:52:50,865 --> 00:52:54,805
Speaker 7:  an 80 decibel siren that's like, you know, like these things that were made

863
00:52:54,805 --> 00:52:58,725
Speaker 7:  for it to be extreme and raw outdoorsy. They just really want

864
00:52:58,725 --> 00:53:01,965
Speaker 7:  that big beautiful screen and the lightness of it. So like for them

865
00:53:02,625 --> 00:53:06,285
Speaker 7:  you're starting to look at the titanium version, which I must say it's very

866
00:53:06,285 --> 00:53:09,965
Speaker 7:  fancy. Yeah I feel very special and fancy while wearing it. I'm like, ooh,

867
00:53:10,565 --> 00:53:14,525
Speaker 7:  I feel expensive. And it is expensive. It starts at 6 99.

868
00:53:14,665 --> 00:53:18,325
Speaker 7:  The, the ultra is I think just a hundred dollars

869
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:22,085
Speaker 7:  more. So you're starting to get to the point where it's like, well well why

870
00:53:22,145 --> 00:53:25,965
Speaker 7:  am I buying an ultra then So I think like the real question is like who is

871
00:53:26,085 --> 00:53:29,485
Speaker 7:  supposed to get what because the prices, especially If, you get the nicer

872
00:53:29,885 --> 00:53:33,685
Speaker 7:  materials, they're starting to look the same. So like

873
00:53:33,705 --> 00:53:37,565
Speaker 7:  the watches themselves also is just like, okay, so really what we're getting

874
00:53:37,565 --> 00:53:41,525
Speaker 7:  down to is battery. Like battery is a big thing

875
00:53:41,945 --> 00:53:45,925
Speaker 7:  and dual band GPS for like if you're like me I I am just like

876
00:53:45,985 --> 00:53:49,765
Speaker 7:  ooh how do I feel about giving up dual band GPS because I

877
00:53:49,765 --> 00:53:53,405
Speaker 7:  really want to know down to the hundredth of a mile like what my run was

878
00:53:53,405 --> 00:53:57,205
Speaker 7:  this morning For sure. And then you just like battery life

879
00:53:57,365 --> 00:54:01,285
Speaker 7:  I think for the ultra is kind of gonna be a distinguishing

880
00:54:01,285 --> 00:54:02,925
Speaker 7:  factor because yeah,

881
00:54:03,105 --> 00:54:06,125
Speaker 1:  So I, I'm glad you brought that up 'cause I, it, it does seem to me that

882
00:54:06,265 --> 00:54:09,805
Speaker 1:  for like an everyday user the

883
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:13,965
Speaker 1:  question of skews is kind of more complicated than ever.

884
00:54:14,245 --> 00:54:16,845
Speaker 1:  I think like, and this is such classic Apple right now, right? There was

885
00:54:16,845 --> 00:54:20,565
Speaker 1:  a time when it was like okay I can pretty quickly explain

886
00:54:20,665 --> 00:54:24,485
Speaker 1:  to you which thing in the line is which and now it's like there's the cheapest

887
00:54:24,485 --> 00:54:27,845
Speaker 1:  one And, then everything up from there is confusing. Yes. And where you land

888
00:54:27,865 --> 00:54:31,805
Speaker 1:  on that line is very hard. But I think my instinct is the same as

889
00:54:31,805 --> 00:54:34,445
Speaker 1:  yours that there's going to be a lot of people who would've wanted an ultra

890
00:54:34,445 --> 00:54:38,245
Speaker 1:  who are now going to be perfectly happy with the series 10, which does all

891
00:54:38,245 --> 00:54:42,085
Speaker 1:  the same stuff in terms of like day-to-day use has an even

892
00:54:42,085 --> 00:54:45,565
Speaker 1:  bigger screen is lighter. Like that all seems like a victory except for the

893
00:54:45,565 --> 00:54:49,005
Speaker 1:  battery life. Like I, the, the ultra, this is the thing that has gotten me

894
00:54:49,005 --> 00:54:51,765
Speaker 1:  for the last couple of revs of this thing is the battery life. It's, it's

895
00:54:51,765 --> 00:54:55,565
Speaker 1:  like an order of magnitude better. It's not like slightly better. It is like

896
00:54:55,775 --> 00:54:57,805
Speaker 1:  twice as good and that is a huge

897
00:54:57,805 --> 00:55:01,605
Speaker 7:  Difference. It is, you can go two days without charging If. you have an ultra.

898
00:55:01,605 --> 00:55:05,405
Speaker 7:  Whereas I, I am still charging daily if I have the series 10

899
00:55:05,825 --> 00:55:09,605
Speaker 7:  and you know, I had I think a, I had a 25 minute

900
00:55:09,605 --> 00:55:12,285
Speaker 7:  shower this morning and it went from

901
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:15,805
Speaker 7:  67% ish to a hundred within that time.

902
00:55:16,065 --> 00:55:17,005
Speaker 7:  That's, that's great.

903
00:55:17,005 --> 00:55:19,405
Speaker 1:  Okay. Right. 'cause fast charging was one of the upgrades here, right?

904
00:55:19,515 --> 00:55:20,845
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So like fast charging

905
00:55:21,065 --> 00:55:24,565
Speaker 1:  That's pretty good. Yeah, mine is currently charging much slower than that.

906
00:55:24,925 --> 00:55:28,205
Speaker 7:  I, I will say that fast charging can be tricky with the Apple Watch because

907
00:55:28,265 --> 00:55:31,885
Speaker 7:  one you have to make sure that the charger supports fast charging And. then

908
00:55:32,025 --> 00:55:35,845
Speaker 7:  two, you have to make sure like all of your accessories are are like gonna

909
00:55:35,945 --> 00:55:39,765
Speaker 7:  do the fast charging for you. 'cause otherwise, like even with the Ultra

910
00:55:39,765 --> 00:55:43,605
Speaker 7:  which supports fast charging like my, my spouse is just like it

911
00:55:43,605 --> 00:55:47,365
Speaker 7:  didn't charge what happened. So like they, I find that to be like a,

912
00:55:47,565 --> 00:55:51,245
Speaker 7:  a thing that people have trouble with in general with knowing

913
00:55:51,245 --> 00:55:55,165
Speaker 7:  whether the charger they're using is actually gonna support that.

914
00:55:55,345 --> 00:55:59,245
Speaker 7:  So especially since it's even less clear If you buy a dock, the docks

915
00:55:59,415 --> 00:56:02,485
Speaker 7:  don't all support the fast charging for the Apple Watch. So that can be very

916
00:56:02,635 --> 00:56:06,085
Speaker 7:  confusing. So yeah, battery life, you know,

917
00:56:06,525 --> 00:56:10,405
Speaker 7:  I the ultra just is a lot more reliable when you

918
00:56:10,405 --> 00:56:14,165
Speaker 7:  stick it into battery saver mode. It does last quite a

919
00:56:14,165 --> 00:56:17,965
Speaker 7:  while in that mode. So I really think like battery life

920
00:56:17,985 --> 00:56:21,205
Speaker 7:  is kind of the distinguishing factor here. 'cause you're going from daily

921
00:56:22,065 --> 00:56:25,995
Speaker 7:  to multi-day and Right. For a lot of people that

922
00:56:25,995 --> 00:56:28,475
Speaker 7:  is really difficult to give up and I understand why it's a big difference.

923
00:56:28,475 --> 00:56:31,795
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I understand why because as soon as you take the smartwatch off there's

924
00:56:31,835 --> 00:56:35,355
Speaker 7:  a good chance you're not gonna put it back on. So that is the thing like,

925
00:56:35,555 --> 00:56:39,115
Speaker 7:  I mean Garmin fans, I love you but y'all are insufferable about like

926
00:56:40,145 --> 00:56:44,115
Speaker 7:  comparing the battery life and it's like yes, yes, yes we know, we

927
00:56:44,115 --> 00:56:47,355
Speaker 7:  know that the Garmin has the better battery life. It you also don't do quite

928
00:56:47,355 --> 00:56:49,795
Speaker 7:  as much so that that there's like that trade off there.

929
00:56:50,025 --> 00:56:52,915
Speaker 1:  Yeah. The big other thing about the series 10, I'm curious about And then.

930
00:56:52,915 --> 00:56:54,835
Speaker 1:  I'm curious if there's anything else that has jumped out to you in testing.

931
00:56:55,455 --> 00:56:59,315
Speaker 1:  Is the speaker both. Both the, like I,

932
00:56:59,435 --> 00:57:02,875
Speaker 1:  I was thinking about this after the event, like a

933
00:57:03,415 --> 00:57:06,435
Speaker 1:  God help us if we get to the point where people are like playing music and

934
00:57:06,555 --> 00:57:09,635
Speaker 1:  podcasts and yelling into their like awful

935
00:57:10,345 --> 00:57:13,715
Speaker 1:  dystopian disaster stuff. Like sounds awful.

936
00:57:14,145 --> 00:57:17,915
Speaker 1:  Also I'd probably do it like would I occasionally

937
00:57:18,145 --> 00:57:21,595
Speaker 1:  like to be able to listen something through the speaker of my watch? Yeah.

938
00:57:22,135 --> 00:57:26,035
Speaker 1:  Do I hate that? Yeah. But like, so this is what I wonder, have you

939
00:57:26,035 --> 00:57:29,675
Speaker 1:  been, have you been testing this at all? Are you running around listening

940
00:57:29,675 --> 00:57:32,635
Speaker 1:  to just like bumping Taylor Swift out of your smartwatch? How's this going?

941
00:57:32,835 --> 00:57:35,635
Speaker 7:  I will not be bumping Taylor Swift out of my smartwatch. I'm not a, I'm not

942
00:57:35,675 --> 00:57:39,395
Speaker 7:  a Swifty, I'm, I'm a K-pop head. So I have

943
00:57:39,395 --> 00:57:42,715
Speaker 7:  been bumping k-pop out of my smartwatch. Okay.

944
00:57:43,495 --> 00:57:47,435
Speaker 7:  But there is like a question of etiquette there because if I

945
00:57:47,435 --> 00:57:50,915
Speaker 7:  am on a subway that just makes me a jerk doing that.

946
00:57:51,575 --> 00:57:55,355
Speaker 7:  And I think Apple itself is very aware that people are

947
00:57:55,425 --> 00:57:58,755
Speaker 7:  primarily going to be using headphones when they listen to stuff through

948
00:57:58,755 --> 00:58:02,595
Speaker 7:  the watch. That is the natural way of doing things. I'm

949
00:58:02,795 --> 00:58:06,395
Speaker 7:  a little baffled by this feature as to like why,

950
00:58:07,535 --> 00:58:10,555
Speaker 7:  and I think it just comes to a topic you and I have talked about is just

951
00:58:10,785 --> 00:58:14,235
Speaker 7:  open ear transparency, like needing that

952
00:58:14,315 --> 00:58:18,115
Speaker 7:  situational awareness. So like where I find it most natural to use is when

953
00:58:18,215 --> 00:58:21,595
Speaker 7:  I'm at home and I have to kind of cook

954
00:58:22,015 --> 00:58:25,915
Speaker 7:  and you know, I find that it's better if I don't have headphones in when

955
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:29,795
Speaker 7:  I'm cooking because you should know what appliances are beeping and

956
00:58:29,795 --> 00:58:32,875
Speaker 7:  beeping at you. I have a menace of a cat who

957
00:58:33,515 --> 00:58:36,795
Speaker 7:  thinks he's Catie and wants to help and I gotta make sure he's not gonna

958
00:58:36,795 --> 00:58:40,675
Speaker 7:  burn himself while licking a pan or you know, that kind of stuff. Sure.

959
00:58:40,675 --> 00:58:43,635
Speaker 7:  Or the spouse comes in, they have a question and like then you have to take

960
00:58:43,635 --> 00:58:47,275
Speaker 7:  out your headphones and you're like what? So in those instances, yeah

961
00:58:47,345 --> 00:58:50,795
Speaker 7:  like it's actually kind of nice to have it playing

962
00:58:51,135 --> 00:58:54,635
Speaker 7:  on the watch 'cause it's closer to you. I leave my phone, I have a recipe

963
00:58:54,815 --> 00:58:58,755
Speaker 7:  up there, I'm trying to do different things. So in that instance, sure

964
00:58:59,255 --> 00:59:03,195
Speaker 7:  it doesn't get that loud. It's loud enough but like If

965
00:59:03,195 --> 00:59:06,555
Speaker 7:  you were to actually whip it out and just try and play your music like a

966
00:59:06,705 --> 00:59:10,515
Speaker 7:  jerk on the subway, no one would hear it

967
00:59:10,515 --> 00:59:14,395
Speaker 7:  because it's, it's just really loud. The ambient noise is super loud anyway

968
00:59:14,535 --> 00:59:18,235
Speaker 7:  and it doesn't get that loud like If, you're in a quiet room, you're definitely

969
00:59:18,235 --> 00:59:22,005
Speaker 7:  gonna be able to hear it. But yeah. Does it have the best sound quality

970
00:59:22,395 --> 00:59:26,125
Speaker 7:  also? No. Like If you care about like hearing the

971
00:59:26,125 --> 00:59:30,045
Speaker 7:  high hat in the distance like in a mix, like let's

972
00:59:30,045 --> 00:59:32,525
Speaker 7:  be real. That's, that's, that's not happening here. But yeah,

973
00:59:32,685 --> 00:59:36,485
Speaker 1:  I mean to me that actually feels like the right outcome. The only

974
00:59:37,205 --> 00:59:40,805
Speaker 1:  occasions I ever would use this really is for like

975
00:59:40,935 --> 00:59:44,765
Speaker 1:  phone calls occasionally out of the watch when like my phone is

976
00:59:44,765 --> 00:59:48,325
Speaker 1:  somewhere else or I'm walking or whatever. Or the

977
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:52,445
Speaker 1:  situation like the one you described where I'm in the kitchen cooking

978
00:59:52,745 --> 00:59:56,685
Speaker 1:  or even like you see the people on a, on a bike ride Yeah. With the

979
00:59:56,685 --> 00:59:59,645
Speaker 1:  Bluetooth speaker or whatever. Like little things like that there, there

980
00:59:59,645 --> 01:00:03,125
Speaker 1:  are moments in time I can see this being sort of okay. And the fact that

981
01:00:03,125 --> 01:00:06,125
Speaker 1:  it's not good enough to be annoying on the subway actually feels like a huge

982
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:09,245
Speaker 1:  victory. Yeah. So I will take that. Yeah. That is good for the world that

983
01:00:09,245 --> 01:00:10,645
Speaker 1:  the speaker is not good enough to do that.

984
01:00:10,795 --> 01:00:14,645
Speaker 7:  Yeah, it it, like I was with the podcast guys yesterday and

985
01:00:14,645 --> 01:00:17,565
Speaker 7:  they're like, oh show us the speaker. And I like, I put it on and they're

986
01:00:17,565 --> 01:00:21,165
Speaker 7:  like eh, it doesn't get that loud. And I'm like, yeah it, it doesn't like

987
01:00:21,245 --> 01:00:21,685
Speaker 7:  I don't want it

988
01:00:21,685 --> 01:00:21,965
Speaker 1:  To get that

989
01:00:21,965 --> 01:00:25,205
Speaker 7:  Loud. No you don't want it to. Yeah. So it's like it's appropriate for like

990
01:00:25,635 --> 01:00:28,965
Speaker 7:  your headphones die and you wanna listen to the last two minutes of your

991
01:00:28,965 --> 01:00:31,485
Speaker 7:  podcast or something like that. Yeah it's appropriate for that. It's not

992
01:00:31,505 --> 01:00:34,965
Speaker 7:  really, we're not replacing phones as playing something,

993
01:00:35,255 --> 01:00:39,205
Speaker 7:  we're not replacing speakers. It's just, it's there If, you need

994
01:00:39,205 --> 01:00:41,885
Speaker 7:  it in a pinch. That sort of situation.

995
01:00:42,235 --> 01:00:45,685
Speaker 1:  Yeah, that's totally fair. Has anything else jumped out to you about this

996
01:00:45,685 --> 01:00:46,645
Speaker 1:  one as you've been reviewing it?

997
01:00:48,915 --> 01:00:52,365
Speaker 7:  It's just lighter and thinner and bigger. It's like really all about the

998
01:00:52,365 --> 01:00:55,605
Speaker 7:  screen and what's really kind of jumping out to me, like I said is

999
01:00:55,765 --> 01:00:59,445
Speaker 1:  There's a whole extra line of text. I still, I I'll never not hear

1000
01:00:59,755 --> 01:01:03,285
Speaker 1:  them saying that during the event you can read an extra line of text. There's

1001
01:01:03,285 --> 01:01:07,005
Speaker 7:  A whole extra whoa line of text. Oh actually because

1002
01:01:07,065 --> 01:01:10,605
Speaker 7:  the screen is bigger actually like the buttons are also slightly bigger,

1003
01:01:10,775 --> 01:01:11,445
Speaker 7:  which is great.

1004
01:01:11,505 --> 01:01:12,525
Speaker 1:  Oh see that's actually nice.

1005
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:16,245
Speaker 7:  Which is great. If, you have nails like me right now during review season

1006
01:01:16,465 --> 01:01:20,325
Speaker 7:  and like touchscreens and nails are not friends. Tough times.

1007
01:01:20,355 --> 01:01:23,885
Speaker 7:  They're not friends. So this actually does help me a little bit when I'm

1008
01:01:23,885 --> 01:01:27,325
Speaker 7:  putting in the passcode. That's kind of nice. The thing that I

1009
01:01:27,875 --> 01:01:31,765
Speaker 7:  have been thinking about though is whether we've reached the end of min

1010
01:01:31,825 --> 01:01:34,965
Speaker 7:  maxing size of screen versus comfort because

1011
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:39,685
Speaker 7:  I really do not think we can get the case size much bigger.

1012
01:01:39,835 --> 01:01:43,445
Speaker 7:  Like once you get to the 43, 44 millimeter as like the

1013
01:01:43,685 --> 01:01:47,405
Speaker 7:  smallest size you are leaving out quite a large swath of people.

1014
01:01:47,645 --> 01:01:50,965
Speaker 7:  'cause I have small wrist but I don't have the smallest risks. I know

1015
01:01:51,555 --> 01:01:55,365
Speaker 7:  lots of like mostly women out here with very, very tiny bird

1016
01:01:55,365 --> 01:01:59,085
Speaker 7:  wrist and the 42 millimeter with this giant honky screen

1017
01:01:59,345 --> 01:02:02,965
Speaker 7:  is kind of gonna be the biggest that I think is gonna be

1018
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:06,925
Speaker 7:  usable for them. After that we start getting into a

1019
01:02:07,365 --> 01:02:11,165
Speaker 7:  territory that's not great and So I do think that means

1020
01:02:11,235 --> 01:02:15,125
Speaker 7:  like we gotta solve this battery issue because you know right, we

1021
01:02:15,125 --> 01:02:18,645
Speaker 7:  saw this on the pixel watch three, two, like the 45 millimeter,

1022
01:02:18,785 --> 01:02:22,445
Speaker 7:  that's about the biggest eye could go comfortably

1023
01:02:22,825 --> 01:02:26,685
Speaker 7:  and So I don't know where companies are gonna go from

1024
01:02:26,685 --> 01:02:30,325
Speaker 7:  here as far as like these big screens,

1025
01:02:31,135 --> 01:02:34,765
Speaker 7:  small, smaller wrist. I feel like we've reached the limit.

1026
01:02:35,545 --> 01:02:39,325
Speaker 7:  So Nice, nice that you pulled out the, the tricks and the stops.

1027
01:02:39,385 --> 01:02:43,245
Speaker 7:  But what's next year? Are we gonna go like the bezel is

1028
01:02:43,655 --> 01:02:47,445
Speaker 7:  8.76% thinner? Like are we just gonna go that

1029
01:02:47,445 --> 01:02:50,965
Speaker 7:  route? Because you know, I did see some people online and I think y'all need

1030
01:02:50,965 --> 01:02:54,685
Speaker 7:  to calm down about how like just visually the, the changes

1031
01:02:54,755 --> 01:02:58,565
Speaker 7:  from the nine to the 10 make the bezels look slightly larger on the

1032
01:02:58,565 --> 01:03:02,005
Speaker 7:  10 that is like optically speaking. True

1033
01:03:02,515 --> 01:03:06,005
Speaker 7:  also as someone who uses all manner of smart watches is not that serious.

1034
01:03:06,235 --> 01:03:10,045
Speaker 7:  It's really not that serious. A lot of the Apple Watch screens, like the

1035
01:03:10,045 --> 01:03:13,485
Speaker 7:  pixel watch ones make use of the darker background and the bezels. So it's

1036
01:03:13,925 --> 01:03:17,285
Speaker 7:  functionally depending on what watch face you use, it's functionally you're

1037
01:03:17,285 --> 01:03:20,765
Speaker 7:  not, you are really not gonna see it there but oh, oh oh

1038
01:03:21,035 --> 01:03:24,885
Speaker 7:  wide oled so you can view more angles. That is surprisingly

1039
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:28,085
Speaker 7:  like it's one of those things that you're like, okay, yeah, whatever.

1040
01:03:28,825 --> 01:03:32,645
Speaker 7:  But like when you're just like very discreetly trying to read a, a funny

1041
01:03:32,645 --> 01:03:36,445
Speaker 7:  text message in a meeting and you're going like, oh yeah, that

1042
01:03:36,445 --> 01:03:38,765
Speaker 7:  that actually is kind of kind of fun.

1043
01:03:39,645 --> 01:03:43,485
Speaker 1:  I agree with that and it does my, my strident belief since

1044
01:03:43,485 --> 01:03:46,445
Speaker 1:  the first days of the Apple Watch has been that If, you have a smart watch

1045
01:03:46,445 --> 01:03:49,005
Speaker 1:  that doesn't tell you the time. Every time you look at it you have failed.

1046
01:03:49,465 --> 01:03:53,445
Speaker 1:  And this is another step in the right direction of when I

1047
01:03:53,445 --> 01:03:56,085
Speaker 1:  look at my watch it will tell me the time. Yes. So I'll take it. Yeah this

1048
01:03:56,085 --> 01:03:59,925
Speaker 1:  is, this is a victory. Okay. So it seems to me that if

1049
01:03:59,925 --> 01:04:03,645
Speaker 1:  you're in the position of like I

1050
01:04:03,645 --> 01:04:07,445
Speaker 1:  need to upgrade my watch, you have an old one, it broke batteries, terrible

1051
01:04:07,845 --> 01:04:11,665
Speaker 1:  whatever, this is probably the one to get right. Like yes or

1052
01:04:11,805 --> 01:04:14,905
Speaker 1:  the last couple of years it's been like you could maybe go back a year and

1053
01:04:14,905 --> 01:04:18,705
Speaker 1:  it would be fine but it feels like this one is probably worth the upgrade.

1054
01:04:19,215 --> 01:04:22,745
Speaker 7:  It's pro, I think it is worth the upgrading to this. Like there are a few

1055
01:04:22,745 --> 01:04:26,145
Speaker 7:  exceptions I guess like If you really like the color pink and you're gonna

1056
01:04:26,145 --> 01:04:30,065
Speaker 7:  go with the aluminum last year's pink is more

1057
01:04:30,065 --> 01:04:33,465
Speaker 7:  pink than this year's rose gold. There are like a very small number of people

1058
01:04:33,605 --> 01:04:37,145
Speaker 7:  I'm talking to at the moment here who care about that particular

1059
01:04:37,515 --> 01:04:41,225
Speaker 7:  color. The one thing I would ask people to consider is blood

1060
01:04:41,225 --> 01:04:45,105
Speaker 7:  oxygen, If, you live in the US if that matters to you in

1061
01:04:45,285 --> 01:04:49,145
Speaker 7:  any capacity at all, If, you do upgrade to the

1062
01:04:49,145 --> 01:04:50,865
Speaker 7:  10, you will be losing that feature.

1063
01:04:51,035 --> 01:04:52,585
Speaker 1:  Right. If you upgrade at all.

1064
01:04:52,935 --> 01:04:56,905
Speaker 7:  Well like If you upgrade and you are in the us If you're outside of the US

1065
01:04:57,005 --> 01:05:00,505
Speaker 7:  you still get blood oxygen. Love that for you. But

1066
01:05:01,525 --> 01:05:05,425
Speaker 7:  my, my thought though as a caveat is do you really

1067
01:05:05,455 --> 01:05:09,145
Speaker 7:  need it on the Apple Watch? My my my my read is no

1068
01:05:09,545 --> 01:05:13,145
Speaker 7:  I have not missed it using the series 10. So

1069
01:05:13,535 --> 01:05:17,405
Speaker 7:  there's that. It's not that serious. Like I, I'm gonna

1070
01:05:17,405 --> 01:05:20,645
Speaker 7:  be real, I don't think most people use the blood oxygen app.

1071
01:05:21,105 --> 01:05:24,925
Speaker 1:  So, I tend to agree. Yeah. Okay. But then the other question

1072
01:05:24,945 --> 01:05:28,765
Speaker 1:  is like if I have an eight or a nine, my watch is

1073
01:05:28,765 --> 01:05:32,565
Speaker 1:  fine. I'll get some trade in money if I get the 10, is it worth like

1074
01:05:32,775 --> 01:05:35,445
Speaker 1:  going out of my way to go get the 10

1075
01:05:35,675 --> 01:05:38,685
Speaker 7:  Calm down. No. Okay. Like calm down. No.

1076
01:05:39,075 --> 01:05:42,405
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I mean this is kind of what it feels like this whole year of Apple

1077
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:46,285
Speaker 1:  products is right. It's like these are good ones. If, you need a new

1078
01:05:46,285 --> 01:05:49,285
Speaker 1:  one. These are probably the ones to get But If, you don't need a new one.

1079
01:05:49,285 --> 01:05:52,685
Speaker 1:  There's nothing here that is going to give you like incredible gadget. fomo.

1080
01:05:52,955 --> 01:05:54,485
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I would, I would say that

1081
01:05:54,585 --> 01:05:58,205
Speaker 1:  Except maybe the titanium a li like a tiny bit. A little bit. The titanium.

1082
01:05:58,545 --> 01:06:02,405
Speaker 7:  The titanium a little bit. Because I will say, you know, just in my experience

1083
01:06:02,405 --> 01:06:06,205
Speaker 7:  in the past using stainless steel, it's lighter. It is significantly lighter

1084
01:06:06,225 --> 01:06:09,765
Speaker 7:  to have the titanium and it looks just like the stainless steel and it's

1085
01:06:09,765 --> 01:06:13,445
Speaker 7:  very pretty and it has a little coating over it to

1086
01:06:13,445 --> 01:06:17,205
Speaker 7:  prevent scratches. We'll see that. That's not something I can know over like

1087
01:06:17,245 --> 01:06:21,125
Speaker 7:  a really short term period like that has to be tested over a

1088
01:06:21,125 --> 01:06:24,645
Speaker 7:  few months. Right. Scrapes, cats trying to eat the watch. Like that sort

1089
01:06:24,645 --> 01:06:28,485
Speaker 7:  of thing. But I gotta say it really looks nice. I, I was just looking,

1090
01:06:28,605 --> 01:06:32,085
Speaker 7:  I was like, wow, I look fancy. Like my outfit

1091
01:06:32,425 --> 01:06:36,365
Speaker 7:  has been upgraded by like several points just because it looks

1092
01:06:36,395 --> 01:06:40,085
Speaker 7:  much nicer. I I tend to have like very sporty accessories. So I don't look

1093
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:43,965
Speaker 7:  polished. But I was like, ooh, ooh I could go to a wedding and this and look

1094
01:06:43,965 --> 01:06:44,205
Speaker 7:  cool.

1095
01:06:44,315 --> 01:06:46,085
Speaker 1:  It's a little like super pish. It

1096
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:49,845
Speaker 7:  Is. It is. It is. It is quite nice. It's quite nice Colors.

1097
01:06:49,925 --> 01:06:51,205
Speaker 7:  Colors are nice this year.

1098
01:06:51,425 --> 01:06:54,445
Speaker 1:  All right, well that's not helping my FOMO as somebody with a perfectly usable

1099
01:06:54,445 --> 01:06:56,965
Speaker 1:  series eight, but that is probably the right

1100
01:06:56,965 --> 01:07:00,445
Speaker 7:  Answer. Yeah, no, no, you're, you're in the chill out zone. I think

1101
01:07:00,985 --> 01:07:02,005
Speaker 7:  the only, only

1102
01:07:02,545 --> 01:07:03,285
Speaker 1:  That's where I live.

1103
01:07:03,665 --> 01:07:07,565
Speaker 7:  The only people who I think have a debate on their hands are people with

1104
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:11,365
Speaker 7:  series sixes. Like those are the only ones who I think series

1105
01:07:11,365 --> 01:07:15,285
Speaker 7:  five older time to upgrade. Yeah. Series six. You could make

1106
01:07:15,325 --> 01:07:18,085
Speaker 7:  a very good case for it. Series seven,

1107
01:07:19,705 --> 01:07:22,485
Speaker 7:  series eight, series nine. I think you could just chill.

1108
01:07:22,875 --> 01:07:25,365
Speaker 1:  Fair enough. All right v thank you so much as always.

1109
01:07:25,475 --> 01:07:26,805
Speaker 7:  Yeah, thanks for having me.

1110
01:07:27,575 --> 01:07:31,315
Speaker 1:  One quick note before we move on, V and I did talk very briefly

1111
01:07:31,485 --> 01:07:35,035
Speaker 1:  about the sleep apnea testing stuff that's in the Apple Watch now,

1112
01:07:35,535 --> 01:07:39,275
Speaker 1:  but when we talked it hadn't come out yet and there were

1113
01:07:39,475 --> 01:07:43,315
Speaker 1:  questions about FDA approval anyway. It did get approved by the

1114
01:07:43,355 --> 01:07:46,235
Speaker 1:  FDA and it will be in the Apple Watch and that is a thing we're gonna have

1115
01:07:46,235 --> 01:07:50,195
Speaker 1:  to follow up on. That's also a hard thing to do in a review cycle. The

1116
01:07:50,195 --> 01:07:54,035
Speaker 1:  health stuff is complicated and it takes time. So we're gonna let V do some

1117
01:07:54,035 --> 01:07:57,555
Speaker 1:  real proper testing on that and we'll get back to you on all things sleep

1118
01:07:57,685 --> 01:08:00,705
Speaker 1:  apnea. Anyway, let's move on. Let's do AirPods.

1119
01:08:01,295 --> 01:08:05,265
Speaker 1:  AirPods, I confess are the ones I am most personally fascinated

1120
01:08:05,285 --> 01:08:09,225
Speaker 1:  by. I'm forever looking at this perfect middle

1121
01:08:09,225 --> 01:08:12,985
Speaker 1:  ground of comfy good sounding, not terribly

1122
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:16,925
Speaker 1:  expensive and noise canceling headphones and the perfect

1123
01:08:16,925 --> 01:08:20,565
Speaker 1:  middle ground of that does not exist. At least it has not existed

1124
01:08:20,745 --> 01:08:24,405
Speaker 1:  so far. But it seems like Apple might be inching ever

1125
01:08:24,465 --> 01:08:28,445
Speaker 1:  closer with the AirPods four. I know this is a hard thing to get

1126
01:08:28,445 --> 01:08:32,365
Speaker 1:  right so I'm not getting my hopes up, but I'm very, very, very, very curious.

1127
01:08:32,855 --> 01:08:36,845
Speaker 1:  Chris Welch has reviewed all of these for us over the years. He has the new

1128
01:08:36,855 --> 01:08:40,025
Speaker 1:  pairs. Let's get into it. Chris Welch. Hello.

1129
01:08:40,395 --> 01:08:42,025
Speaker 8:  Hello David. It's a pleasure to be back.

1130
01:08:42,455 --> 01:08:45,065
Speaker 1:  Just headphones. This is, I feel like there are other things we should talk

1131
01:08:45,065 --> 01:08:45,185
Speaker 1:  about

1132
01:08:45,285 --> 01:08:45,585
Speaker 8:  On the

1133
01:08:45,585 --> 01:08:47,985
Speaker 1:  Show from time to time. You do all these things that are very interesting

1134
01:08:47,985 --> 01:08:49,905
Speaker 1:  and yet we just talk about it. Headphones here on the show.

1135
01:08:50,295 --> 01:08:50,985
Speaker 8:  Fine by me.

1136
01:08:51,445 --> 01:08:54,905
Speaker 1:  So. I. I've realized that unusually this year

1137
01:08:55,255 --> 01:08:59,145
Speaker 1:  with Apple devices. The first question I have to ask is what

1138
01:08:59,165 --> 01:09:02,385
Speaker 1:  are you actually testing? There are things Apple announced that haven't shipped

1139
01:09:02,385 --> 01:09:05,265
Speaker 1:  yet. There are things Apple announced that aren't shipping for a very long

1140
01:09:05,265 --> 01:09:08,545
Speaker 1:  time. You got, you got some devices. What have you been testing

1141
01:09:08,975 --> 01:09:11,065
Speaker 1:  that you actually have access to right now?

1142
01:09:11,505 --> 01:09:15,185
Speaker 8:  So I've got the AirPods for both pairs, the standard pair and also the new

1143
01:09:15,185 --> 01:09:18,585
Speaker 8:  pair that has noise cancellation for the first time. That's really all I've

1144
01:09:18,585 --> 01:09:21,105
Speaker 8:  been testing this whole time is really like how well does noise cancellation

1145
01:09:21,135 --> 01:09:24,865
Speaker 8:  work in this open style of earbud. Thankfully like all the features are there

1146
01:09:24,865 --> 01:09:28,705
Speaker 8:  on day one with this product on, unlike the rest of apple's lineup this

1147
01:09:28,705 --> 01:09:32,585
Speaker 8:  year. So it all works out of the box, which you know, always very nice.

1148
01:09:33,405 --> 01:09:36,785
Speaker 8:  So yeah, just been kinda going back and forth. They sound the same so there's

1149
01:09:36,785 --> 01:09:40,425
Speaker 8:  not much there between them that's all good. They sound really good. Like

1150
01:09:40,585 --> 01:09:43,145
Speaker 8:  honestly like I've never been like a standard AirPods person 'cause like

1151
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:45,905
Speaker 8:  for years they just didn't fit my ears right at all. Like you'd like twist

1152
01:09:45,905 --> 01:09:49,585
Speaker 8:  them in just a certain way to get them to stay. These ones do a better job

1153
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:52,345
Speaker 8:  staying in my ears. So, so far so good I think. Okay.

1154
01:09:52,645 --> 01:09:56,265
Speaker 1:  How different is the design this time? It's always hard to tell in the photos

1155
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:56,945
Speaker 1:  and renders

1156
01:09:57,135 --> 01:10:00,545
Speaker 8:  Very slight tweaks. Like the contours and the shape. Yeah, they didn't change

1157
01:10:00,545 --> 01:10:00,785
Speaker 8:  much.

1158
01:10:01,085 --> 01:10:03,785
Speaker 1:  I'm somebody for whom the open ear AirPods have always worked really well.

1159
01:10:03,855 --> 01:10:06,745
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And I really like the way that they fit. So every time they're like,

1160
01:10:06,745 --> 01:10:09,025
Speaker 1:  we've changed the design, I'm like no don't change the design.

1161
01:10:09,025 --> 01:10:12,785
Speaker 8:  Yeah, yeah. They changed it ever so slightly using 50 million scans or data

1162
01:10:12,785 --> 01:10:16,705
Speaker 8:  points of like ear shapes. So you know the usual but okay not

1163
01:10:16,705 --> 01:10:19,385
Speaker 8:  that different compared to the last ones. I compared them directly and yeah,

1164
01:10:19,385 --> 01:10:20,505
Speaker 8:  they're still pretty similar. Okay.

1165
01:10:20,505 --> 01:10:23,625
Speaker 1:  So the idea is there, there are some people for whom they should fit now

1166
01:10:23,725 --> 01:10:27,265
Speaker 1:  but they shouldn't not work for anybody that they did work for before.

1167
01:10:27,335 --> 01:10:29,945
Speaker 8:  Hopefully. Hopefully there's always someone who's gonna complain.

1168
01:10:30,145 --> 01:10:33,465
Speaker 1:  I know. Yeah. It, it will be me. I mean I, I say they work for me but also

1169
01:10:33,465 --> 01:10:37,265
Speaker 1:  like the number of times they've just fallen out of my head. I,

1170
01:10:37,585 --> 01:10:40,305
Speaker 1:  I don't know what work for me really counts as in a lot of cases. Right.

1171
01:10:40,805 --> 01:10:44,545
Speaker 1:  But it does seem like the big question with the AirPods for

1172
01:10:45,365 --> 01:10:48,785
Speaker 1:  is just as simple as is a NC worth $50,

1173
01:10:49,225 --> 01:10:53,185
Speaker 1:  right? Like that's the price difference. That is the only feature change

1174
01:10:53,285 --> 01:10:55,985
Speaker 1:  as far as I can tell is that kind of the frame. So there

1175
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:59,145
Speaker 8:  Are some other differences. So with a NC Molly you get the wireless charging

1176
01:10:59,235 --> 01:11:02,305
Speaker 8:  which might be enough for a lot of people to spend 50 bucks for. There's

1177
01:11:02,305 --> 01:11:05,665
Speaker 8:  that. Yep. The case has the speaker for fine mine, which I've never used

1178
01:11:06,005 --> 01:11:09,465
Speaker 8:  but it's there. If you need it. And that's really the main three features

1179
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:13,245
Speaker 8:  that it has over the standard one. But the battery life, they're both

1180
01:11:13,465 --> 01:11:17,365
Speaker 8:  IP 54 I think water resistant and so yeah, that's all the

1181
01:11:17,365 --> 01:11:18,005
Speaker 8:  same between the both.

1182
01:11:18,115 --> 01:11:22,045
Speaker 1:  Okay. I am slightly bummed I have to say that we didn't get like one

1183
01:11:22,045 --> 01:11:25,645
Speaker 1:  of the rumors right before was that there might be a more interesting capacitive

1184
01:11:25,645 --> 01:11:28,885
Speaker 1:  case with like some music controls on it. Mm. Like we've seen from some of

1185
01:11:28,885 --> 01:11:31,845
Speaker 1:  these other companies. I am slightly disappointed we didn't get that. I have

1186
01:11:31,845 --> 01:11:32,045
Speaker 1:  to say

1187
01:11:32,105 --> 01:11:35,565
Speaker 8:  No still the white GLO of case it is small, it's like so tiny now it's almost

1188
01:11:35,565 --> 01:11:38,125
Speaker 8:  like a square shape that it's gotten like so small. Oh it's

1189
01:11:38,125 --> 01:11:38,765
Speaker 1:  Small. Okay.

1190
01:11:39,345 --> 01:11:41,165
Speaker 8:  So sorry for people listening to this.

1191
01:11:41,515 --> 01:11:45,285
Speaker 1:  It's like imagine a a piece of orbit gum stretched a little bit.

1192
01:11:45,585 --> 01:11:47,165
Speaker 1:  That's basically what that case looks like now.

1193
01:11:47,555 --> 01:11:47,845
Speaker 8:  Yeah.

1194
01:11:48,865 --> 01:11:52,565
Speaker 1:  So all right, so what's, first of all, let, let's just science

1195
01:11:52,635 --> 01:11:56,605
Speaker 1:  this a little bit for a second. The idea of a NC

1196
01:11:56,865 --> 01:12:00,405
Speaker 1:  on a pair of open ear headphones like the

1197
01:12:00,755 --> 01:12:04,605
Speaker 1:  AirPods four I, I know you were skeptical going

1198
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:08,605
Speaker 1:  in that this is even a thing that is possible to do or do well

1199
01:12:09,465 --> 01:12:13,445
Speaker 1:  how does Apple do a NC on something like this? Like

1200
01:12:13,445 --> 01:12:17,005
Speaker 1:  how does it even sort of in theory work as opposed to a pair of headphones

1201
01:12:17,025 --> 01:12:20,005
Speaker 1:  you can shove interior ears that actually physically block out a lot of things.

1202
01:12:20,525 --> 01:12:23,245
Speaker 8:  So it's been done before like Samsung just put out the buds three that have

1203
01:12:23,245 --> 01:12:27,045
Speaker 8:  the same kind of concept doesn't work quite as well, but the technology's

1204
01:12:27,045 --> 01:12:29,885
Speaker 8:  the same between these and the AirPods Pro like so that there are mics in

1205
01:12:29,885 --> 01:12:32,565
Speaker 8:  the earbuds, they scan for noise and they play like the inverse of whatever

1206
01:12:32,565 --> 01:12:35,605
Speaker 8:  you're hearing to kind of cancel it out. And so Apple says they like kind

1207
01:12:35,605 --> 01:12:39,365
Speaker 8:  of changed the driver so they like tilt towards your ears more with these

1208
01:12:39,385 --> 01:12:42,605
Speaker 8:  and I guess that helps out when it comes to the A NC. And so like I've been

1209
01:12:42,605 --> 01:12:44,885
Speaker 8:  impressed, you have to like set your expectations. Like it's nowhere near

1210
01:12:44,885 --> 01:12:48,445
Speaker 8:  the pros, it's nowhere near tips. So you can't like put these into your ears

1211
01:12:48,445 --> 01:12:52,365
Speaker 8:  and have everything just like fade away. I'd say it cuts

1212
01:12:52,365 --> 01:12:55,725
Speaker 8:  things down by like 30%, maybe

1213
01:12:55,735 --> 01:12:59,725
Speaker 8:  40%, probably 30 ish. So like If you like what

1214
01:12:59,725 --> 01:13:02,445
Speaker 8:  I found is like you can't just put them in and have quiet but If you play

1215
01:13:02,455 --> 01:13:05,565
Speaker 8:  music. That's really where you notice that you don't have to like turn up

1216
01:13:05,565 --> 01:13:08,565
Speaker 8:  the volume as loud as you would would have otherwise. Like that's really

1217
01:13:08,595 --> 01:13:12,165
Speaker 8:  part of this whole appeal I think. And also kind of ties into like apple's

1218
01:13:12,165 --> 01:13:15,045
Speaker 8:  like hearing health stuff lately. So you just don't have to crank the volume.

1219
01:13:15,045 --> 01:13:17,645
Speaker 8:  That's been the main benefit. But if you're like you're on a plane and you're

1220
01:13:17,645 --> 01:13:19,965
Speaker 8:  like just turn 'em on without music, you're gonna hear everything around

1221
01:13:19,965 --> 01:13:23,685
Speaker 8:  you still. So it's not gonna like be some miracle but

1222
01:13:23,925 --> 01:13:25,565
Speaker 8:  Right. But it's nice. Yeah. Okay.

1223
01:13:25,825 --> 01:13:29,765
Speaker 1:  So is maybe the right analogy just in terms of what this feels like in

1224
01:13:30,045 --> 01:13:33,805
Speaker 1:  practice, like a pair of over ear headphones

1225
01:13:33,875 --> 01:13:37,805
Speaker 1:  without the noise cancellation turned on. Like it's, you put them on and

1226
01:13:37,805 --> 01:13:41,245
Speaker 1:  everything gets quieter and a little more isolated

1227
01:13:41,585 --> 01:13:45,125
Speaker 1:  but it's not like when you flip it on and like the noise from the plane

1228
01:13:45,125 --> 01:13:45,725
Speaker 1:  disappears.

1229
01:13:45,875 --> 01:13:49,685
Speaker 8:  Yeah. No, not at all. Okay. Yeah, it takes off like you hear what kinda

1230
01:13:49,685 --> 01:13:52,285
Speaker 8:  like a, I'd say it's like a white noise machine. Like you would still hear

1231
01:13:52,285 --> 01:13:54,965
Speaker 8:  like a fair amount of noise in the background and it's like I was at a bar

1232
01:13:54,965 --> 01:13:57,485
Speaker 8:  last night super loud. I just put 'em in for the sake of trying it and I

1233
01:13:57,485 --> 01:14:01,405
Speaker 8:  could still hear a conversation nearby and people talking. So it's not gonna

1234
01:14:01,405 --> 01:14:04,845
Speaker 8:  like change that kind of environment. But it did cut it down. So

1235
01:14:05,325 --> 01:14:08,525
Speaker 8:  I was playing music at like 70% volume and I could still hear my music just

1236
01:14:08,525 --> 01:14:11,140
Speaker 8:  fine. And so, you know, like it does make a difference, which I think think

1237
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:14,325
Speaker 8:  is gonna be enough for a lot of people to just kind of say 50 bucks, why

1238
01:14:14,325 --> 01:14:16,885
Speaker 8:  not? You know, plus the wireless charging and whatnot so. Right.

1239
01:14:17,115 --> 01:14:20,285
Speaker 1:  Well yeah, it's to your point about the hearing health stuff, that

1240
01:14:20,945 --> 01:14:24,885
Speaker 1:  way of thinking about reducing the noise is actually really interesting

1241
01:14:24,965 --> 01:14:27,285
Speaker 1:  'cause you can see that as a negative, right? Like Right. What that sounds

1242
01:14:27,305 --> 01:14:31,205
Speaker 1:  to me like is when I get on a plane it's still going

1243
01:14:31,205 --> 01:14:35,165
Speaker 1:  to be very loud. So these are not going to replace like the, the Bose

1244
01:14:35,165 --> 01:14:37,885
Speaker 1:  headphones that I like to get on a plane with because it's quiet and helps

1245
01:14:37,885 --> 01:14:41,405
Speaker 1:  me sleep while I watch a movie. Right. But on the other hand, the thing you

1246
01:14:41,405 --> 01:14:45,085
Speaker 1:  just described, like I can listen to music at the bar without it being impossibly

1247
01:14:45,085 --> 01:14:48,685
Speaker 1:  loud and still sort of hear the people around me's actually that's a, that's

1248
01:14:48,685 --> 01:14:51,765
Speaker 1:  a use case, right? Like that's a real Yeah, that's a real thing And it's,

1249
01:14:51,795 --> 01:14:55,685
Speaker 1:  it's kind of a hack on transparency mode in a certain way

1250
01:14:55,925 --> 01:14:59,725
Speaker 1:  where you have headphones that let you hear the world but

1251
01:14:59,725 --> 01:15:03,085
Speaker 1:  also your music and if, if Apple can get that balance right. That's both,

1252
01:15:03,085 --> 01:15:06,845
Speaker 1:  it's a pro and a con of the level of a NC in a strange way.

1253
01:15:06,845 --> 01:15:07,165
Speaker 1:  Right?

1254
01:15:07,165 --> 01:15:09,725
Speaker 8:  Yeah. So it's been good. I mean these actually have, so there's noise canceling

1255
01:15:09,725 --> 01:15:12,325
Speaker 8:  mode, there is transparency mode on these as well and you would think like,

1256
01:15:12,325 --> 01:15:15,645
Speaker 8:  why is that necessary in open, open style earbuds? But so it boosts like

1257
01:15:15,645 --> 01:15:18,485
Speaker 8:  certain frequencies like voices, you can hear people easier. Okay. When you

1258
01:15:18,485 --> 01:15:22,165
Speaker 8:  turn on the transparency mode and it's got all the like AirPods Pro software

1259
01:15:22,165 --> 01:15:25,365
Speaker 8:  stuff, like the conversation awareness, so when you start speaking the volume

1260
01:15:25,395 --> 01:15:29,245
Speaker 8:  goes down yada yada. So that's all there, which is nice. Sound quality

1261
01:15:29,245 --> 01:15:32,765
Speaker 8:  is actually like, surprisingly like the base response is like way better

1262
01:15:32,765 --> 01:15:36,365
Speaker 8:  than like most of the past models they put out. So that's been my main like

1263
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:40,125
Speaker 8:  thing I've noticed. The base response is really good. Yeah, they just sound

1264
01:15:40,125 --> 01:15:43,525
Speaker 8:  really clear. They're still not like my type of earbuds but they're just

1265
01:15:43,725 --> 01:15:45,565
Speaker 8:  really well made AirPods so. Okay.

1266
01:15:45,715 --> 01:15:49,645
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Do you think we're at a point now where the biggest difference between

1267
01:15:50,585 --> 01:15:54,525
Speaker 1:  the AirPods and the pros just in sort of

1268
01:15:54,525 --> 01:15:56,925
Speaker 1:  day-to-day use. Obviously there's the, the hearing health stuff and all that,

1269
01:15:57,285 --> 01:16:00,525
Speaker 1:  but do you think the main difference between the two is just going to be

1270
01:16:01,105 --> 01:16:04,845
Speaker 1:  how they fit and feel in your ears? Like it, it feels like the, the

1271
01:16:04,845 --> 01:16:08,725
Speaker 1:  base AirPods are getting closer to the pros in such a way that the pros

1272
01:16:08,725 --> 01:16:11,685
Speaker 1:  are gonna be better. Yeah. And if, if the main thing you want is sound quality,

1273
01:16:12,035 --> 01:16:15,885
Speaker 1:  yeah fine. But it does seem like the gap between the two in terms

1274
01:16:15,885 --> 01:16:19,645
Speaker 1:  of sort of everyday sound quality is much, much smaller than it once was.

1275
01:16:19,755 --> 01:16:20,045
Speaker 1:  Yeah,

1276
01:16:20,045 --> 01:16:20,325
Speaker 8:  For sure.

1277
01:16:20,665 --> 01:16:22,005
Speaker 1:  That's really exciting. Yeah,

1278
01:16:22,265 --> 01:16:25,485
Speaker 8:  It is. Are the pros like still sound better obviously. And the A NC is obviously

1279
01:16:25,485 --> 01:16:28,645
Speaker 8:  like that much better than these are. So like If you want the best thing,

1280
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:32,005
Speaker 8:  there's that so it's like good, better, best like good is the AirPods four

1281
01:16:32,385 --> 01:16:34,205
Speaker 8:  and they sound really nice for the price

1282
01:16:34,785 --> 01:16:38,605
Speaker 8:  1 29, 1 79 or the AirPods four with a NC

1283
01:16:38,665 --> 01:16:42,525
Speaker 8:  And, then you go up to the pros and so it's a pretty good straightforward

1284
01:16:42,675 --> 01:16:46,245
Speaker 8:  product lineup. I, you know, I can't say that but like the iPads or whatever,

1285
01:16:46,265 --> 01:16:49,205
Speaker 8:  but this is pretty straightforward as as far as like what you should buy

1286
01:16:49,345 --> 01:16:52,005
Speaker 8:  and like here's what you get buying that thing. So yeah,

1287
01:16:52,325 --> 01:16:54,285
Speaker 1:  Compared to the iPads, everything is straightforward. Yes. So, I don't know,

1288
01:16:54,285 --> 01:16:55,525
Speaker 1:  that's a totally fair part

1289
01:16:56,025 --> 01:16:57,285
Speaker 8:  But valid point. Yeah.

1290
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:01,965
Speaker 1:  Does it make sense to you that the AirPods four and the

1291
01:17:01,965 --> 01:17:05,805
Speaker 1:  AirPods four with a NC are two separate things like it, it seems like the

1292
01:17:05,805 --> 01:17:09,725
Speaker 1:  normal Apple move in a lot of ways would've been to just scrap the bottom

1293
01:17:09,785 --> 01:17:13,285
Speaker 1:  one and say $179 is still a pretty competitive price

1294
01:17:13,865 --> 01:17:17,725
Speaker 1:  for this kind of headphone. Yeah. Is it surprising to you that

1295
01:17:17,725 --> 01:17:20,005
Speaker 1:  the sort of very base model exists at all?

1296
01:17:20,225 --> 01:17:22,405
Speaker 8:  Not really. I think they still want something like in that price point. 'cause

1297
01:17:22,405 --> 01:17:25,485
Speaker 8:  there's so many lower cost options from like so many brands like JBL and

1298
01:17:25,485 --> 01:17:29,245
Speaker 8:  whoever else that yeah that cost like $70, $50. So you've gotta have something

1299
01:17:29,245 --> 01:17:33,045
Speaker 8:  that's like not too far off from that and that's what the AirPods four are

1300
01:17:33,465 --> 01:17:36,765
Speaker 8:  and you get most of the same sound qual, well same sound quality and like

1301
01:17:37,115 --> 01:17:40,725
Speaker 8:  much of the same features. The call quality is nice. They've got this new

1302
01:17:40,925 --> 01:17:44,605
Speaker 8:  voice isolation feature from the AirPod pros as well. So I uses AI

1303
01:17:44,745 --> 01:17:48,565
Speaker 8:  of course to make you clear on phone calls. So that's on both

1304
01:17:48,565 --> 01:17:51,845
Speaker 8:  models too. So you get a lot for 1 29 honestly. But If you want a NC and

1305
01:17:52,045 --> 01:17:54,125
Speaker 8:  wireless charging 50 bucks more so.

1306
01:17:54,265 --> 01:17:58,205
Speaker 1:  Got it. Okay. And one question we got on the hotline from actually a couple

1307
01:17:58,205 --> 01:18:01,845
Speaker 1:  of people was how big a deal is the H two chip? And I think

1308
01:18:02,585 --> 01:18:06,365
Speaker 1:  to some extent it's just better, right? Like new

1309
01:18:06,365 --> 01:18:09,765
Speaker 1:  chips do more things. Yeah. And I think if I'm not mistaken, apple mentioned

1310
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:13,845
Speaker 1:  voice isolation as like one of the things that's gonna get better with extra

1311
01:18:13,845 --> 01:18:17,765
Speaker 1:  processing. Yeah. But I'm also assuming based on the way you're describing

1312
01:18:18,005 --> 01:18:21,765
Speaker 1:  A and C working that that is like, that's a huge amount of processing

1313
01:18:21,765 --> 01:18:25,645
Speaker 1:  this thing has to do. Yeah. So that makes me think that there are gonna

1314
01:18:25,645 --> 01:18:29,485
Speaker 1:  be a lot of people who are like, do I buy the H one AirPods because

1315
01:18:29,485 --> 01:18:32,805
Speaker 1:  they're gonna be cheaper or is the H two chip worth it? And it sounds like

1316
01:18:32,805 --> 01:18:36,005
Speaker 1:  maybe the H two chip is gonna be worth it. Yeah, for sure. For sure. Okay.

1317
01:18:36,205 --> 01:18:39,045
Speaker 8:  I would say So I mean it's not that much more expensive. I'm sure you can

1318
01:18:39,045 --> 01:18:41,925
Speaker 8:  find deals on the past models, but these sound better first of all. So like

1319
01:18:41,925 --> 01:18:44,445
Speaker 8:  that's why I would buy them. Most of all they sound significantly better

1320
01:18:44,445 --> 01:18:48,325
Speaker 8:  than the AirPods three did to my ears at least. Always subjective. But yeah,

1321
01:18:48,325 --> 01:18:51,365
Speaker 8:  like you get a lot and like the H two chip is key for a lot of the, those

1322
01:18:51,645 --> 01:18:54,645
Speaker 8:  features plus the A NC. Like this is why these have a lot of these features

1323
01:18:54,645 --> 01:18:58,525
Speaker 8:  and the AirPods max still don't because the AirPods max do not have the H

1324
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:02,485
Speaker 8:  two chip. Yeah. So, but yes, I would myself, I would

1325
01:19:02,485 --> 01:19:05,805
Speaker 8:  go with the A NC model. I think it is worth just having those few extra features

1326
01:19:05,865 --> 01:19:09,685
Speaker 8:  for not a ton more money. But yeah, I mean there are some

1327
01:19:09,805 --> 01:19:12,485
Speaker 8:  downsides. Like there's still no multi-point, which I would love. Apple just

1328
01:19:12,485 --> 01:19:15,605
Speaker 8:  loves it's like multi-device like auto switching, which has gotten better

1329
01:19:15,605 --> 01:19:17,845
Speaker 8:  over the last couple years I think. But it, it can still like always like

1330
01:19:17,845 --> 01:19:21,085
Speaker 8:  pair to the wrong thing at the wrong time when it's like most inconvenient

1331
01:19:21,105 --> 01:19:21,765
Speaker 8:  for you. So,

1332
01:19:22,245 --> 01:19:26,045
Speaker 1:  I Apple is, I would say guilty. A lot of

1333
01:19:26,045 --> 01:19:29,965
Speaker 1:  being too clever by half. And I think, yeah, the clever multi switching is

1334
01:19:29,965 --> 01:19:33,645
Speaker 1:  the most too clever by half thing that Apple does. Yeah. I just want a button

1335
01:19:33,795 --> 01:19:37,445
Speaker 1:  that says, I never ever, ever, ever want to connect my

1336
01:19:37,445 --> 01:19:41,405
Speaker 1:  AirPods to my MAC mini ever. I have never once wanted to, I am never going

1337
01:19:41,425 --> 01:19:45,365
Speaker 1:  to want to stop asking me every single time I sit down in a

1338
01:19:45,365 --> 01:19:48,765
Speaker 1:  chair if I want to connect my AirPods to my Mac mini. Like it just drives

1339
01:19:48,825 --> 01:19:49,645
Speaker 1:  me crazy.

1340
01:19:51,345 --> 01:19:54,525
Speaker 1:  But that is neither here nor there. So you haven't gotten a chance to test

1341
01:19:54,785 --> 01:19:58,725
Speaker 1:  the AirPods Pro two yet with the hearing health stuff,

1342
01:19:58,725 --> 01:20:00,965
Speaker 1:  otherwise they're basically the same. The hearing health stuff is coming.

1343
01:20:01,175 --> 01:20:05,045
Speaker 1:  We'll try that when it comes. Yep. You have I would say

1344
01:20:05,045 --> 01:20:08,645
Speaker 1:  for all intents and purposes, tried the AirPods max because they're the AirPods

1345
01:20:08,645 --> 01:20:11,005
Speaker 1:  max with A-U-S-B-C port and some new colors.

1346
01:20:11,185 --> 01:20:12,285
Speaker 8:  New colors. Yeah. At

1347
01:20:12,285 --> 01:20:15,325
Speaker 1:  Some point I think we'll we'll end up doing a full review of those because

1348
01:20:15,665 --> 01:20:18,925
Speaker 1:  we should, they're gonna be on sale. But my biggest question for you is

1349
01:20:19,625 --> 01:20:23,485
Speaker 1:  coming into this event, there was like a little bit of talk about what

1350
01:20:23,505 --> 01:20:27,325
Speaker 1:  the maxes might be, if there were gonna be maxes on a,

1351
01:20:27,325 --> 01:20:30,125
Speaker 1:  you know, scale of one to 10, how surprised were you that Apple decided to

1352
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:31,925
Speaker 1:  essentially do nothing with the AirPods Max?

1353
01:20:32,665 --> 01:20:35,845
Speaker 8:  Pretty bummed, honestly. 'cause I like the max, you know, I'm not sure like

1354
01:20:35,845 --> 01:20:39,205
Speaker 8:  why they're like so unworthy of like actual hardware upgrades after all these

1355
01:20:39,205 --> 01:20:42,405
Speaker 8:  years. And like I see them everywhere. It's like people clearly buy them,

1356
01:20:42,405 --> 01:20:45,085
Speaker 8:  people like buy like cases for their like ear cups. Have you seen these?

1357
01:20:45,085 --> 01:20:48,765
Speaker 8:  Like on the street? It's wild. So there's a whole like aftermarket for accessories

1358
01:20:48,765 --> 01:20:52,245
Speaker 8:  for the AirPods Max and they're really good headphones. But I assume Apple

1359
01:20:52,245 --> 01:20:55,805
Speaker 8:  just has must have some kinda like customer data that says like, people just

1360
01:20:55,855 --> 01:20:59,485
Speaker 8:  don't need like some of the AirPods Pro features or care, like they just

1361
01:20:59,485 --> 01:21:02,765
Speaker 8:  wanna get on a plane, put these on and zone out and like that's all they

1362
01:21:02,765 --> 01:21:03,445
Speaker 8:  really want them for.

1363
01:21:03,665 --> 01:21:07,245
Speaker 1:  That's interesting that like maybe there's less to do in that

1364
01:21:07,375 --> 01:21:08,285
Speaker 1:  space. Yeah.

1365
01:21:08,505 --> 01:21:10,365
Speaker 8:  But like you would think they would want like some of the hearing health

1366
01:21:10,575 --> 01:21:14,565
Speaker 8:  stuff there too, like in the over ear Yeah. Format too. So, I'm not

1367
01:21:14,565 --> 01:21:18,485
Speaker 8:  sure like what the thinking is there, but you would hope like there's

1368
01:21:18,485 --> 01:21:21,885
Speaker 8:  the true AirPods max too. Not, not too far off.

1369
01:21:22,785 --> 01:21:26,725
Speaker 8:  Who knows? Maybe once the AirPods Pro three come out, they'll

1370
01:21:26,725 --> 01:21:30,165
Speaker 8:  like do both at the same time. But, but yeah, it's a bummer. I mean they're

1371
01:21:30,165 --> 01:21:34,005
Speaker 8:  so heavy and that case hasn't changed the case. The

1372
01:21:34,005 --> 01:21:35,645
Speaker 8:  case is still as it was.

1373
01:21:35,915 --> 01:21:39,485
Speaker 1:  That is the thing that kills me is there are just a couple of really obvious

1374
01:21:39,605 --> 01:21:42,685
Speaker 1:  upgrades. Yeah, I think the, the basic look of it, I've really come around

1375
01:21:42,685 --> 01:21:45,765
Speaker 1:  to over the years. Yeah. I was not wild about it at the beginning, but I

1376
01:21:45,765 --> 01:21:49,645
Speaker 1:  think it, it looks better on people's heads than it does kind of on its own.

1377
01:21:49,705 --> 01:21:53,405
Speaker 1:  So like I, I'm, I'm in favor. Sounds good. Works great. But there are,

1378
01:21:53,415 --> 01:21:57,125
Speaker 1:  there are enough sort of little upgrades both in the hardware and the case

1379
01:21:57,585 --> 01:22:00,645
Speaker 1:  and now even in the, the processing and the software, it's like you could

1380
01:22:00,645 --> 01:22:03,205
Speaker 1:  make these better without trying very hard. Yeah. And that, that is the thing

1381
01:22:03,205 --> 01:22:06,765
Speaker 1:  that kind of bums me out about the max. So. Okay, last question And then,

1382
01:22:06,765 --> 01:22:09,685
Speaker 1:  then I'll, I'll let you get outta here. The, the, again, the big question

1383
01:22:09,725 --> 01:22:13,205
Speaker 1:  I think a lot of people are gonna ask is do I get the four or is it worth

1384
01:22:13,205 --> 01:22:17,165
Speaker 1:  $50 to get the a NC for most people? Obviously

1385
01:22:17,165 --> 01:22:20,925
Speaker 1:  if price is your main question, get the cheaper one, but do you think

1386
01:22:20,925 --> 01:22:24,725
Speaker 1:  most people, the right best option is gonna be to spend the 50 bucks?

1387
01:22:24,745 --> 01:22:26,165
Speaker 1:  Is it worth the upgrade? Yeah.

1388
01:22:26,515 --> 01:22:29,445
Speaker 8:  Okay. I think So I mean it's there. If, you need it and it's pretty easy

1389
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:31,765
Speaker 8:  to just like turn off If. you don't like it. Like you can actually feel so

1390
01:22:31,765 --> 01:22:33,725
Speaker 8:  like some of the pressure that you would get, like when you on a NC from

1391
01:22:33,725 --> 01:22:36,645
Speaker 8:  the AirPods Pro Mm. You still get like some of that sensation. Some people

1392
01:22:36,645 --> 01:22:39,765
Speaker 8:  don't like that, but you can just turn it off If, you don't want that. But

1393
01:22:39,765 --> 01:22:42,285
Speaker 8:  it's nice to have, you know, like if you're out somewhere on the street and

1394
01:22:42,285 --> 01:22:46,125
Speaker 8:  it's like loud, it'll cut it down by like, you know, like a third or so,

1395
01:22:46,395 --> 01:22:50,285
Speaker 8:  like, but, and that's like enough to just play your music and not

1396
01:22:51,065 --> 01:22:54,925
Speaker 8:  go crazy from like outside whatever. So yeah, it's worth it.

1397
01:22:55,185 --> 01:22:57,405
Speaker 1:  All right, fair enough. All right, well one of these days you have to come

1398
01:22:57,405 --> 01:23:00,285
Speaker 1:  back and we're gonna do Pixel Buds, we're gonna do Galaxy Buds and we're

1399
01:23:00,285 --> 01:23:03,045
Speaker 1:  gonna do AirPods and we are going to put a bunch of bad sounding audio on

1400
01:23:03,045 --> 01:23:06,885
Speaker 1:  the Bcast and I cannot wait. So many good reviews. Yeah. Good. Alright

1401
01:23:06,885 --> 01:23:10,365
Speaker 1:  Chris, thank you as always. Thank you sir. Cheers. Alright, we gotta take

1402
01:23:10,365 --> 01:23:13,045
Speaker 1:  one more break. And, then we are gonna take a question from the Vergecast

1403
01:23:13,045 --> 01:23:14,245
Speaker 1:  Hotline. We'll be right back.

1404
01:26:17,125 --> 01:26:20,165
Speaker 13:  think they really showed me why I should get a new iPhone,

1405
01:27:32,925 --> 01:27:36,365
Speaker 4:  this and I couldn't do that before, like

1406
01:27:36,785 --> 01:27:40,365
Speaker 4:  the nine pro fold is like the poster

1407
01:27:40,575 --> 01:27:44,565
Speaker 4:  child for that. Like you can, the way you can use

1408
01:27:44,625 --> 01:27:45,965
Speaker 4:  the, the inner screen,

1409
01:27:47,755 --> 01:27:51,685
Speaker 4:  there's just like, there's really nothing else. Like it is kind

1410
01:27:51,685 --> 01:27:52,805
Speaker 4:  of how I would put it and,

1411
01:27:54,705 --> 01:27:58,405
Speaker 4:  you know, RCS on iOS 18 might alleviate

1412
01:27:58,845 --> 01:28:02,085
Speaker 4:  a little bit of the, the messaging woes. Yeah.

1413
01:28:02,555 --> 01:28:05,965
Speaker 4:  There's still, you know, really not a substitute for like

1414
01:28:06,605 --> 01:28:09,525
Speaker 4:  FaceTime or any of that, but yeah, two times the phone. That's what I

1415
01:28:10,135 --> 01:28:13,725
Speaker 1:  Got's pretty good. I have been amazed

1416
01:28:14,025 --> 01:28:17,005
Speaker 1:  by how much I like the fold. We're gonna come back, you and I are at some

1417
01:28:17,005 --> 01:28:19,645
Speaker 1:  point in the next couple of weeks gonna have to come back and re-litigate

1418
01:28:19,645 --> 01:28:23,565
Speaker 1:  our flip versus fold debate. Mm. Yeah because I have,

1419
01:28:23,725 --> 01:28:27,045
Speaker 1:  I have new feelings that are making me sad about my old feelings and we're,

1420
01:28:27,045 --> 01:28:30,685
Speaker 1:  we're gonna talk about that. I love this phone and I think that's so nice

1421
01:28:30,945 --> 01:28:34,765
Speaker 1:  to, to Keith's point about the Google ecosystem, every time I really

1422
01:28:35,125 --> 01:28:38,325
Speaker 1:  reinvest in Android, which I've been doing because of this phone, I am reminded

1423
01:28:38,345 --> 01:28:42,045
Speaker 1:  of how much better it is to be a Google user on an Android phone.

1424
01:28:42,275 --> 01:28:46,205
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Just in part because Gemini is so built into everything

1425
01:28:46,205 --> 01:28:50,085
Speaker 1:  and you can access all of your information in all the different Google

1426
01:28:50,445 --> 01:28:54,405
Speaker 1:  services. It's so much better. Yeah. As a Google Home controller than the

1427
01:28:54,405 --> 01:28:58,365
Speaker 1:  iPhone is. You get like top level access to all that stuff

1428
01:28:58,425 --> 01:29:01,525
Speaker 1:  in a way that if you're on an iPhone, you always have to launch an app before

1429
01:29:01,525 --> 01:29:04,725
Speaker 1:  you can do Google stuff. You can just do it all from the home screen of your

1430
01:29:04,725 --> 01:29:08,565
Speaker 1:  phone. Yeah. And that's very powerful. But literally it is such a nice phone.

1431
01:29:08,955 --> 01:29:12,365
Speaker 1:  It's such a nice phone. It's, I cannot get over how much I like this phone.

1432
01:29:12,515 --> 01:29:16,165
Speaker 1:  It's thin, it's the right size. Even If, you like don't open the inner screen

1433
01:29:16,165 --> 01:29:18,885
Speaker 1:  all that often, which I don't, it's still a great phone And. then you're

1434
01:29:18,885 --> 01:29:22,805
Speaker 1:  like, oh my God, there's an inner screen. Yeah. It's, I I love this phone

1435
01:29:22,865 --> 01:29:25,685
Speaker 1:  and I think the switching costs have gone way down,

1436
01:29:26,685 --> 01:29:30,245
Speaker 1:  which is very exciting. Like the, the idea that leaving an iPhone and going

1437
01:29:30,245 --> 01:29:33,965
Speaker 1:  to an Android phone is going to sort of break your brain is just not true

1438
01:29:34,195 --> 01:29:38,045
Speaker 1:  anymore. Yeah. Weirdly, the thing that is always the

1439
01:29:38,045 --> 01:29:41,925
Speaker 1:  hardest for me switching is that you swipe down on an

1440
01:29:41,925 --> 01:29:44,845
Speaker 1:  iPhone to get to Spotlight and be able to start searching for stuff and you

1441
01:29:44,845 --> 01:29:48,085
Speaker 1:  swipe up on Android. Oh yeah. That is the thing that takes me the longest

1442
01:29:48,185 --> 01:29:51,325
Speaker 1:  to switch every single time. Yeah. Everything else, they've just become so

1443
01:29:51,325 --> 01:29:55,245
Speaker 1:  similar over time. They have most of the same features. They do most things

1444
01:29:55,385 --> 01:29:59,045
Speaker 1:  the same way. Apple has adopted a lot of Android's customization.

1445
01:29:59,115 --> 01:30:02,845
Speaker 1:  Android has started to sort of organize the phone in the way that Apple

1446
01:30:03,145 --> 01:30:06,525
Speaker 1:  did for a long time. They're just not that far apart. Yeah. Like weirdly,

1447
01:30:06,605 --> 01:30:09,765
Speaker 1:  I agree with you that FaceTime is the single stickiest thing left the RCS

1448
01:30:09,765 --> 01:30:12,805
Speaker 1:  thing. It won't solve everything, but it makes some things easier. You can

1449
01:30:12,935 --> 01:30:16,925
Speaker 1:  deregister from iMessage much more easily than you used to. Yeah.

1450
01:30:17,435 --> 01:30:21,285
Speaker 1:  Liam, our producer did this. He bought a fold and he turned off

1451
01:30:21,925 --> 01:30:25,765
Speaker 1:  iMessage and it used to be somewhere between like 24

1452
01:30:25,785 --> 01:30:29,685
Speaker 1:  and 72 hours you were in like weird iMessage limbo it, it was like

1453
01:30:29,685 --> 01:30:32,685
Speaker 1:  minutes with him. Yeah. This time it was very exciting. Yeah.

1454
01:30:33,205 --> 01:30:36,925
Speaker 4:  I, I live that, that dangerous life like several times

1455
01:30:37,085 --> 01:30:40,725
Speaker 4:  a year when I switch from an iPhone to

1456
01:30:41,475 --> 01:30:45,245
Speaker 4:  Yeah. One of the Android phones and it, it is easier. I think there's

1457
01:30:45,315 --> 01:30:48,965
Speaker 4:  kind of an outdated notion of like how difficult it is to switch

1458
01:30:48,965 --> 01:30:52,725
Speaker 4:  between these systems and I am living

1459
01:30:52,735 --> 01:30:56,645
Speaker 4:  proof that you can do it multiple times a year and it, there's

1460
01:30:56,645 --> 01:31:00,205
Speaker 4:  no like major social cost to it. Yeah.

1461
01:31:00,225 --> 01:31:03,405
Speaker 1:  You will still be a green bubble, but I think yeah, like

1462
01:31:04,105 --> 01:31:07,965
Speaker 1:  it, it's fine. Yeah. Just own being a green bubble. Lean in. Yeah. Your

1463
01:31:07,965 --> 01:31:10,245
Speaker 1:  phone has two screens that's cooler than iPhone.

1464
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:14,165
Speaker 4:  So just open up the phone anytime, you know, you need to prove something.

1465
01:31:14,165 --> 01:31:17,285
Speaker 4:  You know someone like, well, do you have two phones attached to your phone?

1466
01:31:17,525 --> 01:31:20,765
Speaker 1:  Right. Oh, you can't see those words on that screen? Watch this. I have a

1467
01:31:20,765 --> 01:31:21,805
Speaker 1:  whole nother screen. Yeah, no

1468
01:31:21,805 --> 01:31:24,605
Speaker 4:  Big deal. Yeah. Look at this. Yeah, something else. I think

1469
01:31:25,605 --> 01:31:29,365
Speaker 4:  particularly this year with the Pixel series, I haven't tried out

1470
01:31:29,525 --> 01:31:33,365
Speaker 4:  the Pixel Watch three yet, but I'm dying to. But it seems like that

1471
01:31:33,745 --> 01:31:37,205
Speaker 4:  the ecosystem of hardware around it has also gotten

1472
01:31:37,825 --> 01:31:41,125
Speaker 4:  is just elevated this year. Like the Pixel nine hardware,

1473
01:31:41,945 --> 01:31:45,765
Speaker 4:  the Pixel Watch three by all accounts is very nice and finally

1474
01:31:45,765 --> 01:31:49,605
Speaker 4:  just feels like this is a great smartwatch. Like you, you

1475
01:31:49,605 --> 01:31:53,365
Speaker 4:  just buy this one when you have a pixel phone and everything is nice.

1476
01:31:53,745 --> 01:31:57,645
Speaker 4:  So, I think that that's always been part of the, the

1477
01:31:57,645 --> 01:32:01,445
Speaker 4:  math in the Apple ecosystems is like, well you have this phone,

1478
01:32:01,505 --> 01:32:04,925
Speaker 4:  you just buy these earbuds, you buy this watch and you're done and it all

1479
01:32:04,925 --> 01:32:08,645
Speaker 4:  works and yeah. Yeah. Pixel maybe getting there a little bit.

1480
01:32:09,085 --> 01:32:12,965
Speaker 1:  A a hundred percent. And the other thing is that as Google has made

1481
01:32:12,965 --> 01:32:16,325
Speaker 1:  all that stuff work really well with like Fast Pair and nearby share and

1482
01:32:16,325 --> 01:32:19,485
Speaker 1:  all this stuff that is sort of knitting its own ecosystem together, it's

1483
01:32:19,485 --> 01:32:23,125
Speaker 1:  giving that to other companies too. So like we're at a point now where

1484
01:32:23,915 --> 01:32:27,805
Speaker 1:  Apple's ecosystem is probably still a little cleaner

1485
01:32:27,905 --> 01:32:31,165
Speaker 1:  and simpler and better connected, but only If you only buy Apple products

1486
01:32:31,665 --> 01:32:35,645
Speaker 1:  and Google and Android have gotten 90% of the way there with

1487
01:32:35,925 --> 01:32:39,805
Speaker 1:  like the rest of the industry. And I think your just pure

1488
01:32:39,915 --> 01:32:43,845
Speaker 1:  sort of number of choices you have of things that you can attach to your

1489
01:32:43,845 --> 01:32:44,205
Speaker 1:  devices

1490
01:32:45,775 --> 01:32:49,595
Speaker 1:  way better on Android and like, it, it won't be quite

1491
01:32:49,615 --> 01:32:53,275
Speaker 1:  as perfect as just buying an Apple watch and scanning the thing and poof

1492
01:32:53,275 --> 01:32:56,875
Speaker 1:  it's set up. Yeah. But it's a lot closer and you have a lot more choices.

1493
01:32:57,095 --> 01:33:01,035
Speaker 1:  And I think, I think like the, the whole better together

1494
01:33:01,035 --> 01:33:04,435
Speaker 1:  thing that Apple has had for so long is not nearly the advantage it once

1495
01:33:04,435 --> 01:33:04,635
Speaker 1:  was.

1496
01:33:04,945 --> 01:33:05,235
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1497
01:33:06,715 --> 01:33:10,195
Speaker 1:  I am also just sitting here convincing myself to switch to Android. Like

1498
01:33:10,195 --> 01:33:13,955
Speaker 1:  I'm, I'm using the full but I haven't moved my eim yet and I'm sitting here

1499
01:33:13,955 --> 01:33:15,555
Speaker 1:  being like, I it's time to, it's time to do

1500
01:33:15,555 --> 01:33:18,315
Speaker 4:  Eim. Oh, that's a commitment. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe it's time.

1501
01:33:18,315 --> 01:33:22,115
Speaker 1:  It's just time to do it. It's time. I'm just, it's just time. But okay. So

1502
01:33:22,615 --> 01:33:26,555
Speaker 1:  now last question. W would you recommend doing

1503
01:33:26,555 --> 01:33:30,375
Speaker 1:  this? Like is this, if you've been debating leaving the

1504
01:33:30,375 --> 01:33:34,335
Speaker 1:  ecosystem, switching Apple to Android,

1505
01:33:34,795 --> 01:33:35,815
Speaker 1:  is this the year to do it?

1506
01:33:36,955 --> 01:33:40,675
Speaker 4:  I think it is. I think that the hardware has been

1507
01:33:41,095 --> 01:33:44,955
Speaker 4:  on the Pixel side particularly kind of inching towards this.

1508
01:33:44,955 --> 01:33:48,595
Speaker 4:  Like is it really a flagship, eh, it's kind of this like upper

1509
01:33:48,595 --> 01:33:52,515
Speaker 4:  mid-range thing and this, I, I hold a Pixel nine up

1510
01:33:52,515 --> 01:33:54,075
Speaker 4:  next to the iPhone 16

1511
01:33:55,655 --> 01:33:59,635
Speaker 4:  Galaxy S 24 and like they're all just really nice phones and

1512
01:34:00,015 --> 01:34:03,795
Speaker 4:  it sort of feels like the first time that I've, I've been like, yeah,

1513
01:34:03,795 --> 01:34:06,755
Speaker 4:  these, these deserve to all be in the same conversation.

1514
01:34:08,235 --> 01:34:11,075
Speaker 4:  I think it's a really good year to do it and I think we're gonna,

1515
01:34:12,265 --> 01:34:16,195
Speaker 4:  yeah, to your point on the, the Gemini stuff, I think we're going

1516
01:34:16,195 --> 01:34:20,035
Speaker 4:  to get funneled into these AI subscription

1517
01:34:20,645 --> 01:34:24,475
Speaker 4:  nightmares. Yes. Where If, you are in the Google ecosystem and

1518
01:34:24,475 --> 01:34:27,875
Speaker 4:  like I am very much, you know, in Gmail and

1519
01:34:28,115 --> 01:34:31,995
Speaker 4:  Google Docs and all of those services, it's gonna get

1520
01:34:32,085 --> 01:34:36,035
Speaker 4:  weird If you are, you know, trying to use the AI

1521
01:34:36,315 --> 01:34:39,995
Speaker 4:  features and they're behind some kind of like Google one paywall.

1522
01:34:40,215 --> 01:34:43,395
Speaker 4:  You know, I don't know, this is speculation. I don't wanna like

1523
01:34:44,055 --> 01:34:45,795
Speaker 4:  get too far ahead of myself,

1524
01:34:47,695 --> 01:34:50,395
Speaker 4:  but that is something to consider. I think there is

1525
01:34:51,635 --> 01:34:55,445
Speaker 4:  potential for like, value of being all

1526
01:34:55,465 --> 01:34:59,085
Speaker 4:  in on one system, like they're quite wasn't before.

1527
01:34:59,685 --> 01:35:03,645
Speaker 4:  I don't know. There, it, it feels like a, a stick that they're getting ready

1528
01:35:03,705 --> 01:35:05,325
Speaker 4:  to just like smack us with.

1529
01:35:06,285 --> 01:35:10,165
Speaker 1:  I I totally agree. And I think the system thing is the one thing

1530
01:35:10,355 --> 01:35:14,165
Speaker 1:  that weirdly keeps me sort of tied to

1531
01:35:14,385 --> 01:35:18,005
Speaker 1:  iPhone. Like you can use most Google things,

1532
01:35:18,795 --> 01:35:22,725
Speaker 1:  most of the Google universe on an iPhone it's not

1533
01:35:22,725 --> 01:35:26,645
Speaker 1:  as good, but it's there not true in reverse. Right? Yeah. Like if,

1534
01:35:26,645 --> 01:35:30,365
Speaker 1:  if there are any Apple only apps that you like or you like

1535
01:35:30,555 --> 01:35:34,485
Speaker 1:  Siri or there are certain Apple E experiences that you want

1536
01:35:34,485 --> 01:35:38,365
Speaker 1:  to have, they just don't exist on Android and So I. Think the

1537
01:35:38,525 --> 01:35:40,925
Speaker 1:  question of like, do I want to use a little of both

1538
01:35:42,405 --> 01:35:46,255
Speaker 1:  kind of leads you to an iPhone in a strange way where I think If, you

1539
01:35:46,255 --> 01:35:49,975
Speaker 1:  just want to pick one. The clear answer at this moment is Gemini. I think

1540
01:35:50,575 --> 01:35:54,375
Speaker 1:  I, I'm so happy if I'm wrong about this in six months,

1541
01:35:54,395 --> 01:35:57,775
Speaker 1:  but I have incredibly low expectations for what Apple intelligence is gonna

1542
01:35:57,775 --> 01:36:01,135
Speaker 1:  look like for the foreseeable future. And Gemini

1543
01:36:01,595 --> 01:36:05,135
Speaker 1:  has many flaws but is doing a lot of stuff already.

1544
01:36:05,815 --> 01:36:08,615
Speaker 1:  And so If you If you want to just buy in, that's probably the one to start

1545
01:36:08,615 --> 01:36:11,295
Speaker 1:  with as opposed to like crossing your fingers for Siri to get really good

1546
01:36:11,325 --> 01:36:15,255
Speaker 1:  next year. Yeah. But you can a little bit have your cake and eat it

1547
01:36:15,255 --> 01:36:19,095
Speaker 1:  too on the iPhone. Yeah. Because there is both Siri and there is the

1548
01:36:19,095 --> 01:36:22,975
Speaker 1:  Google app and you can, you can have both and So, I think in,

1549
01:36:22,975 --> 01:36:26,895
Speaker 1:  in a weird way. Android forces you to both it, it gives you a bigger ecosystem,

1550
01:36:26,895 --> 01:36:30,255
Speaker 1:  but also forces you to make a choice in a way that the iPhone a little bit

1551
01:36:30,255 --> 01:36:31,015
Speaker 1:  doesn't yet.

1552
01:36:31,125 --> 01:36:32,975
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah. I think that's fair.

1553
01:36:33,515 --> 01:36:34,615
Speaker 1:  But the fold is so nice.

1554
01:36:34,915 --> 01:36:38,375
Speaker 4:  The fold is so NICE's so nice. Just 10 out of 10 on like

1555
01:36:38,375 --> 01:36:38,935
Speaker 4:  niceness.

1556
01:36:39,535 --> 01:36:43,175
Speaker 1:  Yeah. If this thing wasn't $1,800, I would be like screaming from rooftops

1557
01:36:43,175 --> 01:36:46,175
Speaker 1:  that this is the phone everybody should buy. Yeah, absolutely. Its $1,800.
