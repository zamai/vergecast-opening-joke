Description: For the first episode in our three-part miniseries on the future of music, we tell the story of Track Star, a music game show that has become a viral hit on TikTok and Instagram. Jack Coyne, the show's friendly host, tells us how Track Star came to be, why the format works so well, and why A-list celebrities like Olivia Rodrigo, Ed Sheeran, and Kamala Harris are all clamoring to be on the show. Coyne also tells us where Track Star might go next — and why the future of music content might look a lot like the past.

00:00:03,105 --> 00:00:06,835
Speaker 1:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Low Stakes Game

3
00:00:06,835 --> 00:00:10,595
Speaker 1:  shows. I'm your friend David Pierce and I finally

4
00:00:10,745 --> 00:00:14,595
Speaker 1:  have perfected my Nintendo Switch setup. So. I mentioned on this

5
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:18,595
Speaker 1:  show a while back that I needed a new game console mostly because

6
00:00:18,595 --> 00:00:22,235
Speaker 1:  there's a bunch of new games coming out that didn't support my PS four. I

7
00:00:22,235 --> 00:00:26,035
Speaker 1:  wanted something new. The team almost convinced me to

8
00:00:26,035 --> 00:00:29,795
Speaker 1:  buy a steam deck, but then they were like, oh, it doesn't play the only game

9
00:00:29,795 --> 00:00:33,475
Speaker 1:  that you care about, which is EAFC, which used to be called fifa. So that

10
00:00:33,475 --> 00:00:36,995
Speaker 1:  didn't work. So I did a bunch of research and a bunch of trying stuff and

11
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:40,915
Speaker 1:  eventually landed on just buying EAFC at 25 and

12
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:44,435
Speaker 1:  trying to run it on my unbelievably old and kind of

13
00:00:44,615 --> 00:00:48,435
Speaker 1:  busted Nintendo Switch. It's not great Game's a little

14
00:00:48,525 --> 00:00:52,515
Speaker 1:  laggy jumps a lot every time you wanna like move down a menu. It takes

15
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:56,395
Speaker 1:  a full second to think about it, but it works. I have the game game's

16
00:00:56,395 --> 00:01:00,315
Speaker 1:  downloaded, it's all going fine. So of course as I'm want to do, I then got

17
00:01:00,315 --> 00:01:04,275
Speaker 1:  very obsessed with the setup. I bought a new controller from

18
00:01:04,275 --> 00:01:08,075
Speaker 1:  this company called Power A, which looks cool but I hate it, so

19
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:11,835
Speaker 1:  I'm already in the market for another controller. I bought an adapter so

20
00:01:11,835 --> 00:01:15,755
Speaker 1:  that I can connect the switch to my iPad and use it as

21
00:01:15,795 --> 00:01:19,515
Speaker 1:  a bigger screen when I'm on the road. I bought a thing to connect it to my

22
00:01:19,535 --> 00:01:23,435
Speaker 1:  tv. I bought a thing to connect it to my computer monitor. I've

23
00:01:23,435 --> 00:01:26,315
Speaker 1:  done way too much work to make this all work, but now I have gotten to the

24
00:01:26,315 --> 00:01:30,115
Speaker 1:  point where basically anywhere I am at any time with zero setup,

25
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:34,795
Speaker 1:  I can play EAFC 25 on my Nintendo

26
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:38,725
Speaker 1:  Switch. It's the dream. The game doesn't work very well, but

27
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:42,485
Speaker 1:  it works and I have it and at least for now that is enough. Also,

28
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:45,845
Speaker 1:  Nintendo, please release the switch too because my setup is now perfect.

29
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:50,445
Speaker 1:  All I need is a better console. Let's do this. Alright, we're

30
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:54,045
Speaker 1:  not here to talk about the Switch. We are here to do the first episode in

31
00:01:54,045 --> 00:01:57,285
Speaker 1:  our new three part miniseries all about the future of music.

32
00:01:57,735 --> 00:02:01,325
Speaker 1:  We've done episodes on this topic before and it's just something we really

33
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:05,165
Speaker 1:  like talking about and it turns out music actually hits a lot

34
00:02:05,165 --> 00:02:09,125
Speaker 1:  of the stuff we care about most. On The Vergecast. It's about creators, it's

35
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:12,925
Speaker 1:  about policy, it's about ai, it's about infrastructure, it's about

36
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:16,845
Speaker 1:  what it means to be a person in the world. Music

37
00:02:17,155 --> 00:02:20,605
Speaker 1:  just covers everything and so it's really fun to find new ways to talk about

38
00:02:20,605 --> 00:02:24,445
Speaker 1:  music. Today on the show I'm talking to a guy named Jack Coyne who is

39
00:02:24,685 --> 00:02:27,965
Speaker 1:  a creator. He's on TikTok. You've probably seen his show

40
00:02:28,745 --> 00:02:32,365
Speaker 1:  and you may not even have realized it. Super fun conversation. I really enjoyed

41
00:02:32,365 --> 00:02:36,325
Speaker 1:  talking to Jack. I learned a ton. We're gonna get into it. But

42
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:39,805
Speaker 1:  first. I'm almost done with this game. There's this new mode called Rush.

43
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:43,645
Speaker 1:  Every game is like seven minutes long. I'm just gonna finish that and then

44
00:02:43,645 --> 00:02:45,965
Speaker 1:  we'll get into it. This is The Vergecast. We'll be right back.

45
00:03:31,815 --> 00:03:35,145
Speaker 1:  Welcome back. I'm so, so sorry to do this,

46
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:38,825
Speaker 1:  especially right at the beginning, but I have to tell you a

47
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:42,905
Speaker 1:  back in my day story just really quick. So back in

48
00:03:42,905 --> 00:03:46,465
Speaker 1:  my day back when I was a kid, way back in the ancient history,

49
00:03:46,735 --> 00:03:50,585
Speaker 1:  that was the 1990s and early two thousands, MTV was

50
00:03:50,765 --> 00:03:53,545
Speaker 1:  the biggest thing in music. Turn

51
00:03:53,545 --> 00:03:57,425
Speaker 4:  It on, leave it on America. See the, you wanna

52
00:03:57,645 --> 00:04:01,585
Speaker 5:  See, I want my MTV. Alright,

53
00:04:02,265 --> 00:04:03,425
Speaker 4:  I want my mtv.

54
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:09,385
Speaker 1:  I probably don't have to explain the idea of television to most of you,

55
00:04:09,925 --> 00:04:13,825
Speaker 1:  but just in case MTV was a TV channel that for

56
00:04:13,825 --> 00:04:17,385
Speaker 1:  hours and hours a day would just play shows about music.

57
00:04:17,495 --> 00:04:21,385
Speaker 1:  Sometimes it would just play music videos back to back one after

58
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:24,625
Speaker 1:  another for hours at a time and you really cannot

59
00:04:24,775 --> 00:04:28,545
Speaker 1:  overstate how big a deal culturally MTV was.

60
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:33,025
Speaker 1:  In particular, it felt at the time like Carson Daly and TRL

61
00:04:33,035 --> 00:04:36,745
Speaker 1:  Total Request Live were the most important brands in the music

62
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:40,745
Speaker 1:  business. I'm sure there are people who will say otherwise, but that's how

63
00:04:40,745 --> 00:04:44,665
Speaker 1:  it felt to me at the time. I just went back and found a bunch of old

64
00:04:44,865 --> 00:04:48,185
Speaker 1:  TRL episodes, which you can find a surprising number of just by

65
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,985
Speaker 1:  searching around on YouTube and I kept noticing that what I

66
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:56,185
Speaker 1:  remembered about TRL and what TRL actually was are

67
00:04:56,205 --> 00:05:00,105
Speaker 1:  two really different things. I remember TRL as the music video

68
00:05:00,105 --> 00:05:04,025
Speaker 1:  countdown, they would do a top 10 usually over the course of an entire episode

69
00:05:04,205 --> 00:05:08,065
Speaker 1:  and it was a big deal for artists to get in that top 10. They would come

70
00:05:08,085 --> 00:05:12,025
Speaker 1:  on and be congratulated for moving up a spot, but most of

71
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:15,945
Speaker 1:  these episodes that I'm seeing is just artists like hanging out and

72
00:05:15,945 --> 00:05:19,865
Speaker 1:  talking about music. They're sitting on couches or stools or

73
00:05:19,865 --> 00:05:23,665
Speaker 1:  just standing in the crowd, just kind of hanging out. Some

74
00:05:23,665 --> 00:05:26,585
Speaker 1:  artists would bring their favorite music videos to talk about. Sometimes

75
00:05:26,585 --> 00:05:30,305
Speaker 1:  they would guest, host and talk about all the most popular videos. Sometimes

76
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:34,465
Speaker 1:  it had nothing to do with music at all and winds up

77
00:05:34,465 --> 00:05:37,145
Speaker 1:  feeling like, why on earth is this a TRL episode?

78
00:05:38,085 --> 00:05:41,625
Speaker 1:  Here's one good example. I found an episode from 2001 where

79
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,705
Speaker 1:  Jessica Simpson, who at that time was like at the peak of her powers, is

80
00:05:44,705 --> 00:05:48,505
Speaker 1:  talking about her new music and she takes a quiz during

81
00:05:48,505 --> 00:05:52,185
Speaker 1:  another music video about other music and TRL.

82
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:56,225
Speaker 6:  I'm here with Jessica Simpson. Jess, how are you on your your TRL trivia?

83
00:05:56,225 --> 00:05:57,105
Speaker 6:  You've seen the show before.

84
00:05:58,005 --> 00:06:00,805
Speaker 7:  I have seen the show before. I hope I'm good. I'm not really good at this

85
00:06:00,805 --> 00:06:01,765
Speaker 7:  kind of thing, but all them

86
00:06:01,785 --> 00:06:05,525
Speaker 6:  Are. Yeah, we've put you with your fans, Joel, be able to confer with their

87
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:08,805
Speaker 6:  fans. We'll give you five questions and here are your five questions. Question

88
00:06:08,805 --> 00:06:11,085
Speaker 6:  number one is, what was the first NSYNC video to go to

89
00:06:11,085 --> 00:06:14,765
Speaker 1:  Number one? Something about that clip just screams 2001

90
00:06:14,905 --> 00:06:18,565
Speaker 1:  to me. I don't know why. Just everything about it. This is like a

91
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:22,405
Speaker 1:  crazy blast from the past. Anyway, I've been thinking a lot about

92
00:06:22,605 --> 00:06:26,285
Speaker 1:  TRL and MTV recently and really the whole idea of how we

93
00:06:26,565 --> 00:06:30,525
Speaker 1:  discover and get to know new music. Obviously the whole

94
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:34,245
Speaker 1:  music universe is different than it was 20 years ago and

95
00:06:34,465 --> 00:06:38,325
Speaker 1:  in so many ways we're actually much closer to artists than we've ever been.

96
00:06:38,895 --> 00:06:42,805
Speaker 1:  Every time an artist has an album coming out now you suddenly see them on

97
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:46,805
Speaker 1:  a million podcasts or they're doing some like hour long

98
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:50,685
Speaker 1:  interview with Za Lowe for Apple Music where they walk around London or they're

99
00:06:50,685 --> 00:06:54,525
Speaker 1:  doing cover songs on an Australian radio station's YouTube channel, like

100
00:06:54,565 --> 00:06:58,125
Speaker 1:  a version. By the way, one of the great things on the internet, there's more

101
00:06:58,215 --> 00:07:02,125
Speaker 1:  music content than ever and we actually get more chances to

102
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:06,085
Speaker 1:  see and hear from our favorite musicians than ever. A lot of the most

103
00:07:06,245 --> 00:07:09,765
Speaker 1:  followed people on Instagram are musicians. All of that

104
00:07:10,485 --> 00:07:14,325
Speaker 1:  together is why it's so interesting and almost strange to me

105
00:07:14,595 --> 00:07:18,405
Speaker 1:  that this little TikTok show has worked as well as it has. Welcome

106
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:18,605
Speaker 1:  to

107
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,685
Speaker 8:  The show. Hello. Hey. Hey If. you can name the artist. You win five bucks.

108
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:24,405
Speaker 8:  It's The Beatles. The Beatles.

109
00:07:25,305 --> 00:07:29,205
Speaker 1:  The show is called Track Star and it's all over the place on TikTok and

110
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:32,965
Speaker 1:  Instagram in case you've never seen it. It goes more or less like this.

111
00:07:33,555 --> 00:07:37,005
Speaker 1:  Jack Coyne, the host who's a voice you just heard meets somebody on the street.

112
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:40,805
Speaker 1:  Sometimes it's a totally random person just happening to walk by.

113
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:44,645
Speaker 1:  Sometimes it's an a plus list musician. Sometimes it's something kind of

114
00:07:44,645 --> 00:07:48,125
Speaker 1:  right in between and he hands them a microphone and a pair of headphones.

115
00:07:48,795 --> 00:07:52,165
Speaker 1:  Jack then plays a song through the headphones and if the person can guess

116
00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:55,965
Speaker 1:  the artist of that song, they win five bucks. If they get it right, they

117
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:59,325
Speaker 1:  get to try again for 10 bucks or keep the five bucks and walk away.

118
00:07:59,825 --> 00:08:03,645
Speaker 1:  The number keeps doubling until they get it wrong or walk away and then it

119
00:08:03,645 --> 00:08:07,405
Speaker 1:  ends. It's a super simple premise and it really works.

120
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:11,605
Speaker 1:  TrackStar is only a couple of years old but it has 400,000 followers on

121
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:15,285
Speaker 1:  TikTok, another 340,000 on Instagram and is

122
00:08:15,285 --> 00:08:19,165
Speaker 1:  continuing to grow really fast. But more than just the numbers, it's

123
00:08:19,185 --> 00:08:23,165
Speaker 1:  the guests that Jack gets on this show that blow my mind. Just to scroll

124
00:08:23,165 --> 00:08:27,085
Speaker 1:  through some of the most recent ones, Keith Urban is on here. Julia Louis

125
00:08:27,165 --> 00:08:31,085
Speaker 1:  Dreyfuss is here. Joe Jonas, Kamala Harris. Sure.

126
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:35,365
Speaker 1:  Dan Reynolds, the lead singer of Imagine Dragons, Ed Sheeran, Olivia

127
00:08:35,635 --> 00:08:39,085
Speaker 1:  Rodrigo, Nelly Ferdo is here. Okay, sorry. You get the idea. But these are

128
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:42,965
Speaker 1:  a-listers. These are big name people and they're just rolling up

129
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:46,965
Speaker 1:  to listen to Jack CO's playlists. I needed to know

130
00:08:47,065 --> 00:08:50,645
Speaker 1:  why this show has worked. So I called up Jack at his office in Manhattan.

131
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:54,205
Speaker 9:  My name's full name's Jack Coyne and you can call me a content creator.

132
00:08:54,655 --> 00:08:58,565
Speaker 1:  Quick Jack backstory, he got started as a creator way back in the day

133
00:08:58,715 --> 00:09:02,645
Speaker 1:  when he started working for Casey NY Stat who is probably still your favorite

134
00:09:02,735 --> 00:09:06,485
Speaker 1:  YouTuber's. Favorite YouTuber. He was an assistant, an office manager,

135
00:09:06,725 --> 00:09:10,245
Speaker 1:  a producer eventually made videos for Casey's app Beam and

136
00:09:10,245 --> 00:09:14,165
Speaker 1:  basically cut his teeth both as a content creator and more

137
00:09:14,405 --> 00:09:17,165
Speaker 1:  specifically as a content creator on the streets of New York City.

138
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:21,445
Speaker 9:  I worked on his very first YouTube video ever with him and his thing was

139
00:09:21,715 --> 00:09:24,765
Speaker 9:  just, there's a million stories out there, especially in New York City, If,

140
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:28,525
Speaker 9:  you look outside, you'll trip and fall into a story and So

141
00:09:28,805 --> 00:09:32,485
Speaker 9:  I. That attitude was really ingrained in me from like the time I was 18 years

142
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:32,685
Speaker 9:  old.

143
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:36,765
Speaker 1:  Jack, by the way, calls himself a music guy, but only in the way that

144
00:09:37,045 --> 00:09:40,605
Speaker 1:  everyone who likes music is a music guy. He liked classic rock and pop music

145
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:44,485
Speaker 1:  and just liked music. He definitely did not set out to be

146
00:09:44,485 --> 00:09:48,245
Speaker 1:  known for making music related stuff, but a few years ago

147
00:09:48,345 --> 00:09:52,285
Speaker 1:  he was working with brands on social media content and he started a

148
00:09:52,285 --> 00:09:55,245
Speaker 1:  company with his brother and a friend who were both doing the same kind of

149
00:09:55,245 --> 00:09:59,165
Speaker 1:  thing to see if they could all just do it more efficiently together.

150
00:09:59,705 --> 00:10:03,605
Speaker 9:  We said if we put our our clients together and we all help

151
00:10:03,605 --> 00:10:06,565
Speaker 9:  each other with our videos, we'll have extra time on the side to come up

152
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:10,485
Speaker 9:  with our own original shows and ideas. I had previously had

153
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:14,325
Speaker 9:  a YouTube channel, I'd worked with YouTube creators before

154
00:10:14,785 --> 00:10:17,645
Speaker 9:  and I just sensed that there was this huge opportunity in the moment to do

155
00:10:17,645 --> 00:10:21,125
Speaker 9:  something with short form video both on TikTok Instagram

156
00:10:21,465 --> 00:10:25,045
Speaker 9:  and of course on YouTube and so we kind of carved out extra time for

157
00:10:25,045 --> 00:10:28,925
Speaker 9:  ourselves and resources from doing the brand work to be able to create

158
00:10:28,925 --> 00:10:29,565
Speaker 9:  Public Opinion.

159
00:10:30,235 --> 00:10:34,045
Speaker 1:  What was the thing you wanted to do first when you were like, okay,

160
00:10:34,045 --> 00:10:37,605
Speaker 1:  we're gonna have this spare time to make something we wanna make.

161
00:10:37,945 --> 00:10:41,045
Speaker 1:  Did you have a like initial sense of what that thing was? Well,

162
00:10:41,185 --> 00:10:44,885
Speaker 9:  So the reason we called the company Public Opinion was because it was about

163
00:10:44,885 --> 00:10:48,725
Speaker 9:  talking to people. That was like a shorthand way of saying talking to

164
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:52,125
Speaker 9:  people and the reason that we wanted to talk to people is we

165
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:55,485
Speaker 9:  recognized that this man on the street type content was

166
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:59,685
Speaker 9:  increasing in popularity, but we felt like no one was doing it great. It

167
00:10:59,685 --> 00:11:02,485
Speaker 9:  was a lot of like gotcha sort of making fun of people.

168
00:11:03,975 --> 00:11:07,125
Speaker 9:  Let's catch someone in an awkward or funny moment and make them look stupid

169
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:08,085
Speaker 9:  and we were like, I've always

170
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:11,685
Speaker 1:  Felt like half the internet was just people doing Billy on the street impressions.

171
00:11:11,715 --> 00:11:12,005
Speaker 1:  Yeah,

172
00:11:12,035 --> 00:11:15,805
Speaker 9:  Exactly. Yeah, and we felt maybe there's a way to do this that's like nicer

173
00:11:17,065 --> 00:11:20,885
Speaker 9:  and more positive and and maybe we can try and make people a little bit

174
00:11:20,885 --> 00:11:24,605
Speaker 9:  smarter with the stuff we were doing. So we were asking trivia questions

175
00:11:24,605 --> 00:11:27,285
Speaker 9:  about New York City and trying to educate people about New York City. That's

176
00:11:27,285 --> 00:11:28,005
Speaker 9:  where we got started.

177
00:11:28,715 --> 00:11:32,485
Speaker 1:  Okay. Was it, was that like a civic-minded thing

178
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:35,845
Speaker 1:  or was it just fun and you thought New York was cool and that was a good

179
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:36,205
Speaker 1:  way to do it?

180
00:11:36,515 --> 00:11:39,525
Speaker 9:  It's, it's a personal interest thing. It's something that I've always been

181
00:11:40,205 --> 00:11:43,725
Speaker 9:  interested in, curious about and I think it was like, okay guys, we gotta

182
00:11:43,725 --> 00:11:46,245
Speaker 9:  go shoot. We looked out the window and we're like, what's that building?

183
00:11:46,585 --> 00:11:49,005
Speaker 9:  Oh, maybe there's something interesting about that building and we can talk

184
00:11:49,005 --> 00:11:52,565
Speaker 9:  to people about it. And that was the entry point. Okay. It was just like

185
00:11:52,565 --> 00:11:56,285
Speaker 9:  the obvious thing because we were here in New York and I love it here.

186
00:11:56,985 --> 00:12:00,965
Speaker 1:  The Public Opinion channel is very much alive and super fun too, by the

187
00:12:00,965 --> 00:12:04,525
Speaker 1:  way. And it works just the way you think. Since it's obviously currently

188
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:08,245
Speaker 1:  election season, Jack has been mostly running around asking people trivia

189
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:12,205
Speaker 1:  questions about New York City and US presidents and how the two kind

190
00:12:12,205 --> 00:12:12,765
Speaker 1:  of collide,

191
00:12:13,015 --> 00:12:16,885
Speaker 8:  Which president has a parkway named after him? You're driving? Yeah, yeah,

192
00:12:16,885 --> 00:12:18,885
Speaker 8:  yeah, yeah. Driving on the east side. Where are you driving? I think the

193
00:12:18,925 --> 00:12:20,525
Speaker 8:  FDR man. Yes. Two more questions

194
00:12:21,145 --> 00:12:25,125
Speaker 1:  But the problem they ran into early on was that most people in New York don't

195
00:12:25,325 --> 00:12:29,285
Speaker 1:  actually know that much about New York, new York's whole thing. Its whole

196
00:12:29,345 --> 00:12:33,285
Speaker 1:  appeal is that people come from everywhere. It's a super transient

197
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:37,125
Speaker 1:  town. That's what makes it so exciting. But I mean your trivia

198
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:40,885
Speaker 1:  game show isn't very fun if nobody knows any of the answers. Right.

199
00:12:41,565 --> 00:12:44,885
Speaker 9:  I would say maybe our hit rate was two outta 10 people who actually knew

200
00:12:44,885 --> 00:12:47,685
Speaker 9:  something about New York that besides just, oh, I don't really know the answer

201
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:50,725
Speaker 9:  to that question. That's not interesting content. And so it was like our

202
00:12:50,725 --> 00:12:53,605
Speaker 9:  second show has to be something that's much more universal and something

203
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:57,005
Speaker 9:  that everybody can talk about because like I said, Public Opinion,

204
00:12:57,305 --> 00:13:01,165
Speaker 9:  what's something that is gonna cast a wider net music was the obvious answer

205
00:13:02,305 --> 00:13:06,045
Speaker 9:  and we found right away like the hit rate of just getting people to engage

206
00:13:06,045 --> 00:13:09,725
Speaker 9:  with us with higher and their reactions and the stories that came out of

207
00:13:09,725 --> 00:13:12,125
Speaker 9:  talking to songs was really exciting.

208
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:16,525
Speaker 1:  Why was music the obvious answer? I could imagine, especially as a New Yorker,

209
00:13:17,395 --> 00:13:21,205
Speaker 1:  like a dozen things you might land on before music. You're like, let's do

210
00:13:21,205 --> 00:13:25,125
Speaker 1:  Yankees trivia or like let's talk about you know, famous New

211
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:28,805
Speaker 1:  Yorkers or whatever. Like there's a lot of places you could go other than

212
00:13:28,805 --> 00:13:30,685
Speaker 1:  music. Why? Why did you learn on music? Yeah,

213
00:13:30,705 --> 00:13:34,525
Speaker 9:  We definitely thought about doing sports stuff and continue to think about

214
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:37,205
Speaker 9:  doing sports stuff because we have a little tangentially and it's super fun

215
00:13:37,205 --> 00:13:40,725
Speaker 9:  and people are so passionate about that and a few other things. But I think

216
00:13:40,725 --> 00:13:44,605
Speaker 9:  simultaneously we recognize that there was a lot of music

217
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:48,725
Speaker 9:  conversation happening on the platforms and TikTok

218
00:13:49,605 --> 00:13:53,145
Speaker 9:  is a music driven platform, right? Like the reason videos,

219
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:57,145
Speaker 9:  a lot of videos take off is the sounds that are attached to 'em. So, so we

220
00:13:57,145 --> 00:14:00,305
Speaker 9:  were like, let's just get into the sound and music business because

221
00:14:00,885 --> 00:14:04,145
Speaker 9:  that's where the platform is driving people and we pretty quickly realized

222
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:08,065
Speaker 9:  that there's a lot of interest from record labels, from musicians, from

223
00:14:08,065 --> 00:14:11,585
Speaker 9:  music management, PR to attach themselves to something that's making

224
00:14:11,715 --> 00:14:13,745
Speaker 9:  waves in music on social media.

225
00:14:14,535 --> 00:14:18,505
Speaker 1:  This makes perfect sense to me. TikTok is many things but it is mostly

226
00:14:18,865 --> 00:14:22,425
Speaker 1:  a music platform. And remember, just to reset the timeline here,

227
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,665
Speaker 1:  this is like 2022, early 2023 as

228
00:14:26,985 --> 00:14:30,745
Speaker 1:  everyone is going outside again post pandemic and as TikTok is still growing

229
00:14:30,805 --> 00:14:34,145
Speaker 1:  at an absolutely outrageous, unprecedented rate,

230
00:14:34,455 --> 00:14:38,065
Speaker 1:  TrackStar got a hundred thousand followers in its first month of existence,

231
00:14:38,065 --> 00:14:41,945
Speaker 1:  which is wild. They basically started posting videos and it took off immediately

232
00:14:42,525 --> 00:14:46,345
Speaker 1:  and he's right. It's definitely true that music is as universal as

233
00:14:46,545 --> 00:14:49,345
Speaker 1:  anything out there, but what do you think the odds are just as a thought

234
00:14:49,345 --> 00:14:53,245
Speaker 1:  experiment that If you just walked up to some random person and handed them

235
00:14:53,245 --> 00:14:56,725
Speaker 1:  your headphones that they would know the song you were currently listening

236
00:14:56,725 --> 00:15:00,385
Speaker 1:  to. I feel like pretty low, right? Just for fun.

237
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:04,265
Speaker 1:  Here's the top five songs in the United States right now as I'm recording

238
00:15:04,265 --> 00:15:07,985
Speaker 1:  this. According to Billboard Love Somebody by Morgan Wallen brand new.

239
00:15:07,985 --> 00:15:10,945
Speaker 1:  Don't think I've heard it but I think I could probably pick out Morgan Wallen

240
00:15:11,385 --> 00:15:14,465
Speaker 1:  a bar song by Shazi. That one I've got that's been everywhere for months.

241
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:18,745
Speaker 1:  Birds of a Feather by Billie Eilish, maybe I think I could guess

242
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:21,665
Speaker 1:  a Billie Eilish song but I can't hear that one in my head right now. And

243
00:15:21,665 --> 00:15:24,785
Speaker 1:  there's like a whole genre of people who kind of just sound like Billie Eilish,

244
00:15:25,245 --> 00:15:29,145
Speaker 1:  So I, don't know about That one, die With a Smile by Lady Gaga and Bruno

245
00:15:29,175 --> 00:15:32,425
Speaker 1:  Mars. I actually love both those artists and have literally never heard of

246
00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:36,065
Speaker 1:  that song until right this second. And Espresso by Sabrina Carpenter,

247
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,945
Speaker 1:  obviously yes, everybody knows Espresso, even If, you don't think you know

248
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:44,065
Speaker 1:  Espresso, you know Espresso, but that's the top five songs in the country.

249
00:15:44,645 --> 00:15:48,585
Speaker 1:  Do you know all Five? Do you think everyone knows All Five? Every

250
00:15:48,585 --> 00:15:52,385
Speaker 1:  time I watch Track Star, that's all I can think about. How Hard must Jack

251
00:15:52,415 --> 00:15:56,265
Speaker 1:  have to try to find songs that people know And how many throwaway

252
00:15:56,265 --> 00:15:59,945
Speaker 1:  takes must there be of just total failure where people

253
00:15:59,995 --> 00:16:01,145
Speaker 1:  don't know the music?

254
00:16:01,885 --> 00:16:05,425
Speaker 9:  So more often than not, younger people

255
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:09,665
Speaker 9:  who grew up with the streaming platforms are much

256
00:16:09,665 --> 00:16:13,465
Speaker 9:  more playlist oriented and and artist agnostic.

257
00:16:13,495 --> 00:16:17,425
Speaker 9:  They're listening to songs and sounds and they know tons of songs but they're

258
00:16:17,425 --> 00:16:21,385
Speaker 9:  like, I don't know who that is. So oh totally it is harder with

259
00:16:21,385 --> 00:16:25,225
Speaker 9:  like young 20 somethings because they, they just go on Spotify

260
00:16:25,325 --> 00:16:28,545
Speaker 9:  and they listen to a playlist and then that playlist through that playlist

261
00:16:28,545 --> 00:16:30,505
Speaker 9:  they discover certain types of artists that they like.

262
00:16:32,085 --> 00:16:35,945
Speaker 9:  So if I can figure that out, it's helpful. Okay, you like this one band?

263
00:16:35,955 --> 00:16:39,425
Speaker 9:  Maybe there's like a thread here that I can pull on but, but now I think

264
00:16:39,425 --> 00:16:42,385
Speaker 9:  there's a little bit of pushback with that generation where some people are

265
00:16:42,385 --> 00:16:45,705
Speaker 9:  saying, you know what, I want to go back and discover what the eighties was

266
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:49,145
Speaker 9:  like. And you find these younger people who are like, I love classic rock

267
00:16:49,505 --> 00:16:52,665
Speaker 9:  and some of those videos perform really well for us. Or we had a kid who's

268
00:16:52,885 --> 00:16:56,425
Speaker 9:  in high school and he's like, I'm really into yacht rock man, I can't believe

269
00:16:56,425 --> 00:16:58,865
Speaker 8:  We're doing yacht rock with a 17-year-old Here you are,

270
00:17:01,915 --> 00:17:05,545
Speaker 10:  Great song, bless the reins, kind of wanna let it play through to be honest.

271
00:17:05,565 --> 00:17:05,865
Speaker 10:  Let it

272
00:17:05,865 --> 00:17:08,745
Speaker 8:  Play, let it Rock. It's Africa by Toto $5, let's

273
00:17:08,745 --> 00:17:10,385
Speaker 10:  Go introduce yourself. My name's Jack,

274
00:17:10,475 --> 00:17:11,585
Speaker 8:  Great name, great name

275
00:17:12,005 --> 00:17:15,865
Speaker 9:  And and the internet loved this kid because he just

276
00:17:15,865 --> 00:17:19,625
Speaker 9:  was talking about how great yacht rock is and he's like 16 years old

277
00:17:20,485 --> 00:17:23,865
Speaker 9:  and he was just had an amazing run of songs and was so funny and

278
00:17:24,185 --> 00:17:28,105
Speaker 9:  charismatic. So when we first started the very first episodes I had

279
00:17:28,105 --> 00:17:31,785
Speaker 9:  created a playlist of like game show, I called it, I have a playlist on my

280
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:35,225
Speaker 9:  phone now. It's called like game show game songs or something. Okay. And

281
00:17:35,225 --> 00:17:38,625
Speaker 9:  it's just like great classic songs like If, you go at the

282
00:17:38,855 --> 00:17:42,625
Speaker 9:  500 greatest artists of all time Rolling Stone List and pick their best

283
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,825
Speaker 9:  songs. Like that's a good, like songs everybody kind of knows.

284
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:50,245
Speaker 9:  So we just, I had a playlist set and If you didn't know these songs,

285
00:17:50,535 --> 00:17:53,725
Speaker 9:  sorry You're Outta Luck. And then there was like the realization of well

286
00:17:53,725 --> 00:17:56,885
Speaker 9:  if someone gets out after two songs that's kind of boring, you want to encourage

287
00:17:56,885 --> 00:18:00,085
Speaker 9:  them to go to five or six, it's more fun, interesting video.

288
00:18:00,905 --> 00:18:03,685
Speaker 1:  So now when they're doing a random interview with a person on the street,

289
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:07,285
Speaker 1:  Jack will usually start by talking with them a little bit about music.

290
00:18:07,705 --> 00:18:11,085
Speaker 1:  And when it's a celebrity it becomes a big research project to find songs

291
00:18:11,155 --> 00:18:14,725
Speaker 1:  that both might be in their wheelhouse but also

292
00:18:14,725 --> 00:18:18,605
Speaker 1:  meaningful to them. In both cases the goal very explicitly is

293
00:18:18,605 --> 00:18:22,085
Speaker 1:  for people to do well at the game but not so well it's suspicious,

294
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:26,365
Speaker 1:  you know, you wanna make it easy enough to be fun without making it so

295
00:18:26,365 --> 00:18:29,285
Speaker 1:  easy. It's boring and that's a really tricky balance.

296
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:33,885
Speaker 9:  So there's like a dialogue, what kind of stuff do you listen to? And I

297
00:18:33,885 --> 00:18:37,205
Speaker 9:  think we did one early version where somebody was like, I only love jazz

298
00:18:37,255 --> 00:18:40,685
Speaker 9:  music. And so it's like, okay, let's do a jazz theme. And that video performed

299
00:18:40,685 --> 00:18:44,485
Speaker 9:  well and you realize like having a group of different jazz songs

300
00:18:44,655 --> 00:18:48,325
Speaker 9:  gives the video a theme in addition to the person that you're talking to.

301
00:18:48,325 --> 00:18:51,725
Speaker 9:  There's another sort of narrative playing out there. And so

302
00:18:51,915 --> 00:18:55,885
Speaker 9:  shifted much more into, can I try and find like groupings of songs

303
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:59,805
Speaker 9:  that make sense together? Anytime we do eighties pop, it's

304
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,205
Speaker 9:  like it's clear what's where you're going and the audience wants to know

305
00:19:03,205 --> 00:19:06,125
Speaker 9:  what are the eighties pop songs that ace gonna play here. So finding those

306
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:09,885
Speaker 9:  themes is helpful. And then when it comes to someone

307
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:13,765
Speaker 9:  who's a celebrity, it's trying to research them and and

308
00:19:13,765 --> 00:19:17,565
Speaker 9:  understand or listening to their music and thinking to myself what do,

309
00:19:17,565 --> 00:19:20,605
Speaker 9:  what do I think they were inspired by? And if I can figure that out,

310
00:19:21,115 --> 00:19:24,045
Speaker 9:  they're gonna have a bigger reaction say, how do you know that I was into

311
00:19:24,045 --> 00:19:27,605
Speaker 9:  this song? I just guessed it. Based on these other songs you've written,

312
00:19:27,605 --> 00:19:30,405
Speaker 9:  they sound like alike or they, it seems like there's inspiration there

313
00:19:31,425 --> 00:19:34,525
Speaker 1:  As with everything on the internet, the whole process isn't quite as random

314
00:19:34,665 --> 00:19:38,045
Speaker 1:  and chaotic and man on the street as it might seem in the videos. But I think

315
00:19:38,045 --> 00:19:41,925
Speaker 1:  that's fine and we're gonna talk more about how TrackStar works

316
00:19:42,145 --> 00:19:45,645
Speaker 1:  and why it works. But first we gotta take a break. We'll be right back.

317
00:20:34,185 --> 00:20:37,245
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. So let's just go behind the music here for a minute

318
00:20:37,245 --> 00:20:41,005
Speaker 1:  with TrackStar and talk about how the show actually gets made because I think

319
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:44,925
Speaker 1:  something about its structure and format is actually a big part of why it

320
00:20:44,925 --> 00:20:48,885
Speaker 1:  works. So the whole thing just starts with Jack just wandering

321
00:20:48,905 --> 00:20:50,205
Speaker 1:  out into the streets of New York.

322
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:54,525
Speaker 9:  So the way that we approach like man on the street content creation

323
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:58,365
Speaker 9:  is I, I have a sign that I hold up that I just in Sharpie

324
00:20:58,365 --> 00:21:02,085
Speaker 9:  on cardboard write whatever the question is and the question might be name

325
00:21:02,085 --> 00:21:06,005
Speaker 9:  the artist win $5 or it might be like New York City trivia win

326
00:21:06,005 --> 00:21:09,645
Speaker 9:  a prize and people see that sign and they approach me and they say, what

327
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:11,725
Speaker 9:  is this about? I wanna win some money, I wanna be a part of this.

328
00:21:12,195 --> 00:21:16,045
Speaker 1:  This is one way to do a man on the street stuff The other way, the one

329
00:21:16,165 --> 00:21:19,925
Speaker 1:  I think you see probably more often online is just to ambush people with

330
00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:23,565
Speaker 1:  a microphone and a camera. Catching people off guard in that case is part

331
00:21:23,725 --> 00:21:27,525
Speaker 1:  of the appeal and frankly part of why it's fun to watch. But that

332
00:21:27,525 --> 00:21:31,365
Speaker 1:  was never Jack's thing. I can't tell if he's too embarrassed to do it

333
00:21:31,545 --> 00:21:35,525
Speaker 1:  or feels too bad or it just feels sort of gross. But whatever it is, he

334
00:21:35,525 --> 00:21:38,965
Speaker 1:  didn't wanna do it. So instead he'd stand there with a sign, wait for someone

335
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:42,565
Speaker 1:  to come up to him, he would explain the show and then they were off and running.

336
00:21:42,915 --> 00:21:46,005
Speaker 1:  Jack would hand them a pair of headphones, they would put them on and then

337
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:47,045
Speaker 1:  he'd hand them a microphone.

338
00:21:47,425 --> 00:21:51,045
Speaker 9:  So the handheld microphone was going back to when we

339
00:21:51,465 --> 00:21:54,645
Speaker 9:  run a whiteboard, deciding what we wanted to do. I wanted to

340
00:21:55,005 --> 00:21:58,325
Speaker 9:  capture this like local news feel and give

341
00:21:58,755 --> 00:22:02,645
Speaker 9:  like the idea of handing a microphone to someone on the street

342
00:22:02,645 --> 00:22:05,805
Speaker 9:  of New York. Like we wrote down on the board voice of New York City. That's

343
00:22:05,805 --> 00:22:09,245
Speaker 9:  what we wanted to be one of our intentions. So when I have a mic and I say,

344
00:22:09,265 --> 00:22:12,125
Speaker 9:  you know what, we're gonna give you a chance to spotlight and say your piece

345
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:15,845
Speaker 9:  or put your thing. That was the in the sort of what we were trying to indicate

346
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:19,965
Speaker 9:  visually with with the stick mic and the flags. So that was

347
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:23,845
Speaker 9:  totally locked in the headphones were both practical so

348
00:22:23,845 --> 00:22:27,685
Speaker 9:  like you're not, we could cut the music however we want to and people can

349
00:22:27,685 --> 00:22:31,525
Speaker 9:  sort of be in the zone. And then it was also a visual signifier of when you

350
00:22:31,525 --> 00:22:35,045
Speaker 9:  put the headphones on you're part of the game. And then there's the

351
00:22:35,045 --> 00:22:39,005
Speaker 9:  branding aspect where we felt like at some point before we started the

352
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:42,685
Speaker 9:  show I'm like a headphone brand will wanna sponsor this show for sure because

353
00:22:42,715 --> 00:22:46,245
Speaker 9:  this we're just making headphones look cool. So it was a lot of those things

354
00:22:46,405 --> 00:22:46,685
Speaker 9:  I think.

355
00:22:47,335 --> 00:22:49,145
Speaker 1:  Have you gotten the headphone sponsor yet?

356
00:22:49,315 --> 00:22:52,145
Speaker 9:  We've had a few throughout the years. We've had a few different different

357
00:22:52,145 --> 00:22:55,385
Speaker 9:  ones. Yeah, we've worked with Sennheiser, Bose and Beats.

358
00:22:55,985 --> 00:22:59,505
Speaker 1:  I think this kind of stuff is so clever and it's the stuff I think about

359
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:03,505
Speaker 1:  all the time when I watch these really successful social shows. If, you create

360
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:07,025
Speaker 1:  a show that requires nothing other than a set of Bluetooth headphones, a

361
00:23:07,025 --> 00:23:10,905
Speaker 1:  smartphone and two handheld local news microphones. You can do that

362
00:23:10,905 --> 00:23:14,825
Speaker 1:  show basically anywhere and with almost no setup. Like

363
00:23:14,885 --> 00:23:18,825
Speaker 1:  do you know why the Hot one set is all black the way it is or

364
00:23:18,885 --> 00:23:22,585
Speaker 1:  why all of those like Vanity Fair videos or the Wired Auto Complete

365
00:23:22,585 --> 00:23:26,385
Speaker 1:  series are just on white backgrounds. It's at least in part

366
00:23:26,445 --> 00:23:29,585
Speaker 1:  so that they can set up that set basically anywhere.

367
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,545
Speaker 1:  Because one thing I've learned over the years is that If, you want to do

368
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:36,545
Speaker 1:  a show with famous people, your show has to be able to travel to those

369
00:23:36,545 --> 00:23:40,385
Speaker 1:  famous people. And in this case it's a heck of a lot simpler than

370
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:43,625
Speaker 1:  showing up and eating hot wings and talking about your feelings. All you

371
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:47,005
Speaker 1:  have to do is show up, put on headphones and listen to some music. But there

372
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:50,525
Speaker 1:  is one other thing about Track Star that's really clever and I think kind

373
00:23:50,525 --> 00:23:54,205
Speaker 1:  of unique in this space, it's also a game for the viewer.

374
00:23:54,555 --> 00:23:58,445
Speaker 9:  There's like a couple different aspects of it. There's playing people's snippets

375
00:23:58,445 --> 00:24:01,285
Speaker 9:  of songs like on when you're driving around on the car, on the radio is a

376
00:24:01,285 --> 00:24:05,245
Speaker 9:  game that everyone's played. Like this is not a new idea. So it was

377
00:24:05,245 --> 00:24:09,005
Speaker 9:  more taking this concept of guest the artist and putting it in a

378
00:24:09,005 --> 00:24:12,165
Speaker 9:  framework that's gonna make sense for social media. And I think the biggest

379
00:24:12,745 --> 00:24:16,325
Speaker 9:  lesson that we took away was people like watching the guest,

380
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:19,685
Speaker 9:  they like watching the interaction but they also like to be actively

381
00:24:20,245 --> 00:24:24,165
Speaker 9:  participating in what's happening. So a lot of the comments are, oh you

382
00:24:24,165 --> 00:24:27,245
Speaker 9:  shouldn't put the album cover 'cause I guessed it too soon. Like or I've,

383
00:24:27,275 --> 00:24:30,845
Speaker 9:  I've watched people watching it on their phone looking over their shoulder

384
00:24:31,185 --> 00:24:34,365
Speaker 9:  and they're saying the answers as they're watching it, ah, that that happened.

385
00:24:34,365 --> 00:24:36,725
Speaker 9:  Like when I showed it to my mom for the first time, she's like, oh that's

386
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:40,405
Speaker 9:  Bruce Springsteen. And so then I realized we were onto something 'cause

387
00:24:40,715 --> 00:24:44,085
Speaker 9:  there's this active participation instead of sitting back and

388
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:45,205
Speaker 9:  watching it.

389
00:24:45,655 --> 00:24:48,765
Speaker 1:  Right, which is different from your average like even

390
00:24:49,115 --> 00:24:52,165
Speaker 1:  celebrity interview or something where you're, you're just sort of in the

391
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:54,805
Speaker 1:  audience, like you're trying to invent something that you're both watching

392
00:24:54,805 --> 00:24:55,965
Speaker 1:  and playing simultaneously.

393
00:24:56,905 --> 00:24:59,165
Speaker 9:  And I think because of that, which I guess is

394
00:24:59,245 --> 00:25:02,325
Speaker 1:  A game show like that, you just made a good game show basically. Yeah, well,

395
00:25:02,325 --> 00:25:05,285
Speaker 9:  Well when you watch Jeopardy, right? Right, you're trying to answer the questions

396
00:25:05,865 --> 00:25:08,525
Speaker 9:  as quick as Ken Jennings or whoever's on

397
00:25:09,705 --> 00:25:13,325
Speaker 9:  and So I think what's cool is because of the celebrities and the regular

398
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:17,005
Speaker 9:  people mix, everyone who's watching feels like if I'm in New York,

399
00:25:17,095 --> 00:25:20,725
Speaker 9:  maybe I could end up being on this show and maybe I could win a lot of money.

400
00:25:20,855 --> 00:25:24,325
Speaker 9:  Which say that's why we watch Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? All these other

401
00:25:24,325 --> 00:25:25,885
Speaker 9:  shows, like we could win a million dollars

402
00:25:26,665 --> 00:25:30,525
Speaker 1:  At this point. I think I get why the show works, it's fun to play

403
00:25:30,525 --> 00:25:34,325
Speaker 1:  this kind of trivia game. It's fun to watch strangers succeed and frankly

404
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:38,045
Speaker 1:  even more fun to watch them fail. And there's also something about

405
00:25:38,195 --> 00:25:41,405
Speaker 1:  just all kinds of man on the street content that is compelling.

406
00:25:41,955 --> 00:25:45,325
Speaker 1:  Like do you ever see those videos where a bunch of dudes set up a basketball

407
00:25:45,325 --> 00:25:48,845
Speaker 1:  hoop or a soccer goal and then they throw the ball to a bunch of strangers

408
00:25:49,065 --> 00:25:52,765
Speaker 1:  who either shoot it or kick it or get hit in the head or fall

409
00:25:52,865 --> 00:25:56,725
Speaker 1:  on their heels trying to do it or whatever. That all works

410
00:25:56,745 --> 00:26:00,485
Speaker 1:  for the same reason. I honestly, I swear to you, I think I could make that

411
00:26:00,485 --> 00:26:04,285
Speaker 1:  shot. I hope that I get to try someday and I will watch every single one

412
00:26:04,285 --> 00:26:07,725
Speaker 1:  of those videos when they cross my timeline, So I get Why the show works.

413
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:11,765
Speaker 1:  But I'm still wondering why all of these big name musicians keep

414
00:26:11,765 --> 00:26:15,565
Speaker 1:  showing up on TrackStar. It's not the biggest show in the world. It's doing

415
00:26:15,565 --> 00:26:19,445
Speaker 1:  well, but it's not, you know, earth shattering and frankly a lot of

416
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:22,885
Speaker 1:  these artists are vastly more famous than Jack or TrackStar.

417
00:26:23,225 --> 00:26:27,085
Speaker 1:  It kind of seems like he has more to gain than they do. And plus

418
00:26:27,155 --> 00:26:30,645
Speaker 1:  when they do come on, it's not like they do some nakedly

419
00:26:30,645 --> 00:26:34,165
Speaker 1:  promotional version of the game where they talk about themselves the whole

420
00:26:34,165 --> 00:26:37,965
Speaker 1:  time or they only listen to their own songs. There's tons of that kind of

421
00:26:37,965 --> 00:26:41,845
Speaker 1:  thing on the internet and it's all fine. But on Track Star, they really are

422
00:26:41,845 --> 00:26:45,485
Speaker 1:  just another contestant playing the game sometimes literally the only

423
00:26:45,695 --> 00:26:49,165
Speaker 1:  promo they do is just saying their name. And obviously

424
00:26:49,435 --> 00:26:53,405
Speaker 1:  even that is not a new idea at all. Of course every late night guests

425
00:26:53,465 --> 00:26:57,005
Speaker 1:  who plays a game with Jimmy Fallon or does like the thing where they

426
00:26:57,475 --> 00:27:01,405
Speaker 1:  test British snacks versus American snacks, they're all promoting

427
00:27:01,605 --> 00:27:04,245
Speaker 1:  something without wanting to seem like they're promoting something. You know

428
00:27:04,245 --> 00:27:08,005
Speaker 1:  what I mean? But like that's the Tonight Show. Jack Queen is great,

429
00:27:08,055 --> 00:27:11,885
Speaker 1:  don't get me wrong, but I think Jimmy Fallon is probably just a smidge

430
00:27:11,885 --> 00:27:15,605
Speaker 1:  more famous and yet apparently every single one of track

431
00:27:15,605 --> 00:27:19,245
Speaker 1:  star's celebrity appearances have come from those people getting in touch

432
00:27:19,245 --> 00:27:23,125
Speaker 1:  with him, not the other way around. That means a-list. Musicians are

433
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:26,925
Speaker 1:  going out of their way to be on his show. Who was the first artist

434
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:27,525
Speaker 1:  to reach out?

435
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:32,185
Speaker 9:  Olivia Rodrigo. Okay. It was Olivia Rodrigo or Ed

436
00:27:32,185 --> 00:27:35,625
Speaker 9:  Sheeran, I can't remember the order. But those two were very early on and

437
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:38,545
Speaker 9:  close to each other. It was crazy. Yeah.

438
00:27:39,565 --> 00:27:40,945
Speaker 1:  Why did they reach out?

439
00:27:42,025 --> 00:27:45,545
Speaker 9:  I guess they have savvy teams and then I, I think in

440
00:27:45,545 --> 00:27:49,385
Speaker 9:  hindsight now I've realized more so that this is part

441
00:27:49,385 --> 00:27:53,345
Speaker 9:  of the music business now is being on social

442
00:27:53,345 --> 00:27:56,985
Speaker 9:  media and making sure that these social platforms are

443
00:27:57,195 --> 00:28:00,705
Speaker 9:  aware of what you're doing in the music space. And so

444
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:04,625
Speaker 9:  doing stuff on your own TikTok account is important and then appearing

445
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:08,625
Speaker 9:  in the TikTok universe is important or or your

446
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:09,505
Speaker 9:  streams aren't gonna do well.

447
00:28:10,085 --> 00:28:13,975
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I think part of the reason I ask about that specifically with

448
00:28:13,975 --> 00:28:17,095
Speaker 1:  TrackStar is your, you're not

449
00:28:17,755 --> 00:28:21,625
Speaker 1:  doing the thing where it's like, let's do a podcast where we talk

450
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:25,465
Speaker 1:  about your album for an hour or you're not saying like let's

451
00:28:25,465 --> 00:28:28,985
Speaker 1:  rank your 10 favorites of your own songs. Like the sort of standard things

452
00:28:28,985 --> 00:28:32,505
Speaker 1:  people do to promote themselves in their work. People just come on and play

453
00:28:32,505 --> 00:28:36,265
Speaker 1:  your game, right? Like and and the most they get to say

454
00:28:37,025 --> 00:28:39,705
Speaker 1:  I watched the Keith Urban one again right before we did this. So this is

455
00:28:39,705 --> 00:28:42,985
Speaker 1:  like fresh on my mind. All he says is my name is Keith Urban. Like he barely

456
00:28:43,665 --> 00:28:47,305
Speaker 1:  promotes himself or his work or anything like at all. He's just like, what's

457
00:28:47,305 --> 00:28:51,265
Speaker 1:  up, I'm Keith Urban and does the show with you. And on the one hand

458
00:28:52,015 --> 00:28:55,825
Speaker 1:  it's slightly surprising that that's a thing artists are willing to do in

459
00:28:55,825 --> 00:28:58,825
Speaker 1:  this day and age when everything is so transactional and promotional and

460
00:28:58,825 --> 00:29:02,705
Speaker 1:  all that stuff. But also the fact that they started coming to you just

461
00:29:02,705 --> 00:29:06,625
Speaker 1:  wanting to do that is like very cool and very unusual in this moment. Yeah,

462
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:07,105
Speaker 1:  in the industry.

463
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:11,525
Speaker 9:  I think that and that you can look at the comment section on that video.

464
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:16,525
Speaker 9:  I think it's the best thing that he could have done to promote himself is

465
00:29:16,525 --> 00:29:20,245
Speaker 9:  to not talk about himself because people are are saying, damn, this guy

466
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:24,005
Speaker 9:  is really cool. Who knew Keith Urban was so cool? Yeah. And knew so much

467
00:29:24,005 --> 00:29:26,605
Speaker 9:  about music And that's where they're commenting and then they're going to

468
00:29:26,605 --> 00:29:29,925
Speaker 9:  his profile and they're looking at his music and they're like, is this guy

469
00:29:30,005 --> 00:29:33,805
Speaker 9:  let me explore this myself. And you give the audience the tool of

470
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:37,045
Speaker 9:  feeling like they get to discover it on their own instead of shoving it down

471
00:29:37,045 --> 00:29:40,965
Speaker 9:  their throats. And I think that's one of the great things about the

472
00:29:41,055 --> 00:29:43,255
Speaker 9:  show is that we, it's not like heavy promotional.

473
00:29:43,745 --> 00:29:46,495
Speaker 1:  There are two things in there that I find really interesting and frankly

474
00:29:46,565 --> 00:29:50,455
Speaker 1:  very telling and very 2024. The first is the idea that you have to

475
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:54,215
Speaker 1:  keep signaling to the platforms themselves, TikTok and Instagram and the

476
00:29:54,215 --> 00:29:57,855
Speaker 1:  rest that you're relevant and you're around. You have to keep making your

477
00:29:57,855 --> 00:30:01,455
Speaker 1:  own stuff obviously, but also showing up in stuff with a similar

478
00:30:01,585 --> 00:30:05,375
Speaker 1:  focus and a similar audience to be like, Hey algorithms, other people think

479
00:30:05,415 --> 00:30:08,815
Speaker 1:  I matter. This has obviously been a thing forever, right? Creator

480
00:30:08,925 --> 00:30:12,495
Speaker 1:  collabs have been around as long as there have been creators. But there's

481
00:30:12,495 --> 00:30:16,055
Speaker 1:  something specific about signaling that to the platform that I find really

482
00:30:16,335 --> 00:30:20,055
Speaker 1:  fascinating. The other thing is the thing that keeps making me think of TRL,

483
00:30:20,525 --> 00:30:24,495
Speaker 1:  that maybe actually doing something that gets you out there but doesn't just

484
00:30:24,605 --> 00:30:28,375
Speaker 1:  feel like pure promotion of your latest project is more important

485
00:30:28,765 --> 00:30:32,455
Speaker 1:  than ever. This is the reason people post their personal lives

486
00:30:32,675 --> 00:30:35,975
Speaker 1:  on Instagram. It's the reason authenticity is

487
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:40,015
Speaker 1:  everything, right? That stuff is what people care about now.

488
00:30:40,015 --> 00:30:43,935
Speaker 1:  It's what they gravitate to and it feels more important to do

489
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:48,175
Speaker 1:  and maybe harder to pull off on social media than just about on any

490
00:30:48,175 --> 00:30:52,055
Speaker 1:  other platform. And I think TrackStar and things like it give people

491
00:30:52,175 --> 00:30:55,415
Speaker 1:  a way to show up in front of an audience that feels

492
00:30:55,755 --> 00:30:59,615
Speaker 1:  candid and authentic and not nakedly promotional even

493
00:30:59,615 --> 00:31:02,735
Speaker 1:  when it's not exactly any of those things.

494
00:31:03,435 --> 00:31:06,975
Speaker 1:  On a lot of the videos that Jack does with well-known artists, there are

495
00:31:07,095 --> 00:31:11,015
Speaker 1:  comments from people who love that the artist isn't promoting themselves

496
00:31:11,155 --> 00:31:14,775
Speaker 1:  on the Keith Urban video, which I just re-watched, there's a ton of that.

497
00:31:14,775 --> 00:31:17,375
Speaker 1:  People love that Keith is just a guy who wants to show up and talk about

498
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:21,255
Speaker 1:  music. And I think that works for Keith Urban. There are also, by the

499
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:24,535
Speaker 1:  way, comments from people on every single one of these videos who are just

500
00:31:24,535 --> 00:31:28,455
Speaker 1:  like, oh my gosh, imagine running into so-and-So in New York or

501
00:31:28,615 --> 00:31:32,495
Speaker 1:  OMG, I can't believe you just ran into them. I assume a bunch of

502
00:31:32,495 --> 00:31:36,335
Speaker 1:  those people are in on the bit, but I bet they aren't all in on the

503
00:31:36,335 --> 00:31:40,255
Speaker 1:  bit. And I think that vibe is really important both for the

504
00:31:40,255 --> 00:31:44,015
Speaker 1:  show and for the guests coming onto it. Personally, I first

505
00:31:44,015 --> 00:31:47,495
Speaker 1:  found TrackStar because of one of those better known artists. I think.

506
00:31:48,135 --> 00:31:50,215
Speaker 1:  I think it was Olivia Rodrigo Go

507
00:31:53,295 --> 00:31:56,415
Speaker 8:  Birthday, 50 cents. It was the number one song of the year, the year you

508
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:59,975
Speaker 8:  were born. I did know that. Can you introduce yourself? Hey, I'm Olivia Rodrigo,

509
00:31:59,975 --> 00:32:00,735
Speaker 8:  thanks for having me.

510
00:32:01,035 --> 00:32:04,335
Speaker 1:  But I do also have a distinct memory of seeing the Track star video with

511
00:32:04,335 --> 00:32:08,295
Speaker 1:  Malcolm Todd who is an up and coming artist who was in track stars all

512
00:32:08,295 --> 00:32:11,775
Speaker 1:  time, most popular video with more than 15 million views.

513
00:32:11,985 --> 00:32:12,335
Speaker 1:  Three

514
00:32:12,335 --> 00:32:16,055
Speaker 11:  20 or you want to take the 1 63 20? I just have to beat Olivia. Rodrigo,

515
00:32:16,275 --> 00:32:18,815
Speaker 11:  you're not going two, there's one goal at this point. She's

516
00:32:18,815 --> 00:32:19,455
Speaker 8:  Unbeatable.

517
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:24,975
Speaker 11:  Oh, black Sabbath.

518
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:30,055
Speaker 1:  The fact that Malcolm Todd was more popular than Olivia Rodrigo or

519
00:32:30,295 --> 00:32:33,415
Speaker 1:  Ed. Sheeran or any of the other names that I've mentioned so far. By the

520
00:32:33,415 --> 00:32:36,895
Speaker 1:  way, did I mention Oprah yet? Because Oprah was on the show pretty recently.

521
00:32:37,645 --> 00:32:41,605
Speaker 1:  Wild Times. This all continues to surprise me, but it

522
00:32:41,605 --> 00:32:45,245
Speaker 1:  turns out that celebrities even really big ones aren't needle

523
00:32:45,305 --> 00:32:46,645
Speaker 1:  movers the way that you might think.

524
00:32:47,275 --> 00:32:49,805
Speaker 9:  It's interesting, I've thought about a lot like what would happen if Taylor

525
00:32:49,805 --> 00:32:52,325
Speaker 9:  Swift came on the show. That would be a huge moment, right? Biggest artists

526
00:32:52,325 --> 00:32:56,255
Speaker 9:  in the world. I think we would maybe gain

527
00:32:56,725 --> 00:33:00,535
Speaker 9:  5,000 followers from having Taylor Swift done. I don't, I think the

528
00:33:00,535 --> 00:33:03,255
Speaker 9:  video itself would do really well and then maybe some people would write

529
00:33:03,255 --> 00:33:06,735
Speaker 9:  about it and say, Taylor Swift went on this social media show,

530
00:33:07,355 --> 00:33:10,895
Speaker 9:  but, and that would be valuable for us from a brand equity standpoint, but

531
00:33:10,895 --> 00:33:14,735
Speaker 9:  it would not boost the following in any meaningful

532
00:33:14,735 --> 00:33:18,255
Speaker 9:  way. But then down the road, you know,

533
00:33:18,525 --> 00:33:21,815
Speaker 9:  Oreo might say, wow, this guy had Taylor Swift Dom, we should pay him a million

534
00:33:21,815 --> 00:33:23,055
Speaker 9:  dollars to do something else.

535
00:33:24,545 --> 00:33:27,815
Speaker 1:  Let's talk about the something else there. But first. We have to take a break.

536
00:33:28,025 --> 00:33:28,735
Speaker 1:  We'll be right back.

537
00:34:17,475 --> 00:34:21,335
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. So TrackStar is working, it's popular, it's

538
00:34:21,335 --> 00:34:24,655
Speaker 1:  growing. The format is endlessly repeatable and essentially works forever.

539
00:34:25,155 --> 00:34:28,695
Speaker 1:  The team does want to have Taylor Swift on just in case that wasn't clear

540
00:34:28,755 --> 00:34:32,455
Speaker 1:  before. And Jack also has a running list of other ideal guests.

541
00:34:33,085 --> 00:34:36,375
Speaker 1:  He's talked a bunch in interviews before about Bruce Springsteen, but there

542
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:37,255
Speaker 1:  are lots of others too.

543
00:34:38,175 --> 00:34:42,135
Speaker 9:  Barack Obama. Oh yeah. Because he does, he releases his

544
00:34:42,135 --> 00:34:43,775
Speaker 9:  songs all the time and And

545
00:34:43,775 --> 00:34:46,695
Speaker 1:  Nobody ever believes him, which I love. Everybody is like he, there's no

546
00:34:46,695 --> 00:34:47,895
Speaker 1:  way he listens to these songs.

547
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:51,815
Speaker 9:  I would, I would actually play him the songs from his own playlist. Yeah.

548
00:34:51,815 --> 00:34:55,535
Speaker 9:  Be like, you really listen to Million Dollar Baby by Tommy Richmond, like

549
00:34:55,535 --> 00:34:59,095
Speaker 9:  that's really your jam. Yeah. And then I'm imagining him anyway,

550
00:34:59,455 --> 00:35:03,295
Speaker 9:  that would be a fun one to do just to like put him to the test. I think

551
00:35:03,395 --> 00:35:06,935
Speaker 9:  as far as musicians go, there's Paul McCartney

552
00:35:08,035 --> 00:35:11,415
Speaker 9:  so, or Ringo even might be more legendary than Paul McCartney. Sure.

553
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:16,575
Speaker 9:  So there's like those classic just people who've been around for a long

554
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:19,615
Speaker 9:  time who are legends and icons are great. And then

555
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:24,255
Speaker 9:  I think that there's a huge opportunity with like hip hop that we

556
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:28,135
Speaker 9:  haven't fully tapped into where like an extended conversation

557
00:35:28,165 --> 00:35:31,935
Speaker 9:  with Nas would be really cool. And talking about stuff that he's

558
00:35:31,935 --> 00:35:35,575
Speaker 9:  listening to and rappers that inspired him I think would be a little unexpected.

559
00:35:36,115 --> 00:35:39,605
Speaker 9:  And then, yeah, more non-musicians, more just like

560
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:43,925
Speaker 9:  interesting people who care about music I think would be fun. And athletes.

561
00:35:44,465 --> 00:35:47,965
Speaker 9:  That's like the real untapped one. Totally. Like I want to talk to LeBron

562
00:35:47,965 --> 00:35:51,885
Speaker 9:  James, like I he loves music. What if what? What would it be like if he and

563
00:35:51,885 --> 00:35:54,445
Speaker 9:  I were in a room together and I'm playing him songs and he's getting all

564
00:35:54,445 --> 00:35:55,365
Speaker 9:  fired up this, I

565
00:35:55,365 --> 00:35:56,045
Speaker 1:  Love listening

566
00:35:56,045 --> 00:35:56,565
Speaker 9:  To this before

567
00:35:56,605 --> 00:35:57,765
Speaker 1:  A game. Yeah,

568
00:35:57,765 --> 00:35:58,365
Speaker 9:  It'd be amazing.

569
00:35:59,105 --> 00:36:03,045
Speaker 1:  Beyond that though, it's pretty clear to me that the Public Opinion team

570
00:36:03,185 --> 00:36:07,085
Speaker 1:  has tapped into something bigger than just the 92nd

571
00:36:07,175 --> 00:36:11,085
Speaker 1:  setup with the headphones and the microphone on TikTok. So now they're trying

572
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,445
Speaker 1:  to expand outside of that.

573
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:16,685
Speaker 9:  I mean I think it's exciting for us to experiment and add on different layers

574
00:36:16,785 --> 00:36:19,725
Speaker 9:  and try different things. So we recently started doing a head-to-head TrackStar

575
00:36:19,725 --> 00:36:20,885
Speaker 9:  versus Competition,

576
00:36:20,975 --> 00:36:22,285
Speaker 1:  Which I like. It's very good,

577
00:36:22,415 --> 00:36:25,805
Speaker 9:  Which is fun where you get, especially when you have two artists who have

578
00:36:25,805 --> 00:36:29,685
Speaker 9:  a song that they're collaborating on or maybe it's a band with where

579
00:36:29,685 --> 00:36:32,805
Speaker 9:  you can create some of that band rivalry and banter.

580
00:36:33,705 --> 00:36:36,445
Speaker 9:  So we're experimenting with that. And then we have another show that we do

581
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:40,005
Speaker 9:  called Track Star Presents, which is a performance show here in the studio

582
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:44,445
Speaker 9:  and we put out episodes like every week or two and it's kind of like

583
00:36:44,445 --> 00:36:48,405
Speaker 9:  a tiny desk concert but with more conversation in between the songs.

584
00:36:48,745 --> 00:36:52,565
Speaker 9:  And that's like a half 20 minute to a half hour episode on YouTube. So

585
00:36:52,565 --> 00:36:53,325
Speaker 9:  it's very different.

586
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:57,665
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Is that, how big a focus is that for you right now

587
00:36:57,685 --> 00:37:01,265
Speaker 1:  trying to sort of build the like longer form YouTube

588
00:37:01,335 --> 00:37:01,825
Speaker 1:  channel?

589
00:37:02,535 --> 00:37:06,265
Speaker 9:  Well we just, for a long time we had both shows Public Opinion

590
00:37:06,565 --> 00:37:10,465
Speaker 9:  and Track Star on one YouTube channel and we recently decided to

591
00:37:10,465 --> 00:37:14,385
Speaker 9:  split them just because it felt like the two, there was two different audiences

592
00:37:14,645 --> 00:37:17,985
Speaker 9:  and so putting two different videos up on the same channel didn't make sense.

593
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:22,145
Speaker 9:  So we finally split them and started a new track star YouTube

594
00:37:22,145 --> 00:37:25,625
Speaker 9:  channel and our first video was five or so minute

595
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:29,305
Speaker 9:  conversation with Amelia de Malden Bird from Chicken Shop Date. She's great.

596
00:37:29,305 --> 00:37:33,285
Speaker 9:  and we, we realized she's amazing. We realized doing she her

597
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:36,205
Speaker 9:  press people said, can she come on Track Star? She's gonna be in New York.

598
00:37:36,385 --> 00:37:40,205
Speaker 9:  Yes, of course. That'd be amazing. We film for 20 to 30 minutes probably

599
00:37:40,205 --> 00:37:44,045
Speaker 9:  each episode. And what you see on TikTok is 90 or less usually and we're

600
00:37:44,045 --> 00:37:47,805
Speaker 9:  like, we're leaving so much great stuff on the floor, like

601
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:50,445
Speaker 9:  why don't we put out a five minute episode and show people what that's like

602
00:37:50,465 --> 00:37:53,885
Speaker 9:  and then add some more layers to it. And so we just put out the first one

603
00:37:54,145 --> 00:37:57,965
Speaker 9:  and then we're putting out these TrackStar presents sessions

604
00:37:58,065 --> 00:38:01,445
Speaker 9:  on the same channel. So we're really excited about it. The hard part about

605
00:38:01,515 --> 00:38:05,365
Speaker 9:  long form is you have to create the packaging. You're not just a

606
00:38:05,365 --> 00:38:08,125
Speaker 9:  hundred percent relying on the algorithm to push it to people who want it.

607
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:12,085
Speaker 9:  Right? You have to get people to click in, which is a whole other game.

608
00:38:12,985 --> 00:38:16,765
Speaker 1:  Do you think you're in a position now where you

609
00:38:16,865 --> 00:38:20,365
Speaker 1:  and TrackStar are big enough that you can pull that audience

610
00:38:20,945 --> 00:38:24,685
Speaker 1:  anyway? Or does it truly feel like starting from nothing trying to make it

611
00:38:24,685 --> 00:38:25,285
Speaker 1:  happen on YouTube?

612
00:38:26,515 --> 00:38:28,895
Speaker 9:  It feels like starting from from nothing because

613
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:33,735
Speaker 9:  the consumption pattern is so, so different.

614
00:38:34,165 --> 00:38:38,125
Speaker 9:  Like when you're watching short form videos in your feed, it's like

615
00:38:38,755 --> 00:38:42,495
Speaker 9:  you're on the toilet, you're making coffee, you're in line for something.

616
00:38:42,525 --> 00:38:45,455
Speaker 9:  It's just like in the background throughout your day. Whereas YouTube is

617
00:38:45,455 --> 00:38:49,175
Speaker 9:  like, you've gotta really dial in and pay attention to it. Even a podcast

618
00:38:49,515 --> 00:38:52,015
Speaker 9:  can be like, you're in your car, it's in the background, you're walking to

619
00:38:52,015 --> 00:38:55,975
Speaker 9:  work. Whereas YouTube, you really have to get people and and I think

620
00:38:55,975 --> 00:38:59,375
Speaker 9:  it's almo, a huge percentage of it now is happening on connected TVs.

621
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:03,615
Speaker 9:  So you really gotta get people to say, instead of watching Netflix, I'm gonna

622
00:39:03,615 --> 00:39:07,535
Speaker 9:  watch TrackStar for a half hour. And so it's a big jump and hopefully we

623
00:39:07,535 --> 00:39:09,815
Speaker 9:  can get some people, but I think we have to find that people who are already

624
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:13,215
Speaker 9:  looking for great stuff on YouTube and get them to discover us,

625
00:39:14,015 --> 00:39:17,935
Speaker 1:  A big part of making the existing channel work and the success of all these

626
00:39:17,935 --> 00:39:21,495
Speaker 1:  new initiatives hangs on the person in these videos that we haven't talked

627
00:39:21,495 --> 00:39:24,895
Speaker 1:  that much about yet. That's Jack. He's always

628
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:29,055
Speaker 1:  really involved in the track star videos. He's often wearing a backwards

629
00:39:29,235 --> 00:39:33,095
Speaker 1:  hat or like a cool overcoat, but he is always laughing and having

630
00:39:33,115 --> 00:39:36,655
Speaker 1:  fun with the guests and he's the one who really sets the vibe

631
00:39:36,915 --> 00:39:39,975
Speaker 1:  for the whole thing in a way that I actually think is really important. He

632
00:39:39,975 --> 00:39:43,695
Speaker 1:  like points to the camera and demands of the person that they introduce

633
00:39:43,695 --> 00:39:47,175
Speaker 1:  themselves regardless of whether it's a person that you've never seen before

634
00:39:47,235 --> 00:39:51,135
Speaker 1:  and we will never see again. Or if it is like one of the 50 most famous people

635
00:39:51,475 --> 00:39:54,935
Speaker 1:  on planet Earth, I love that he's kind of

636
00:39:55,215 --> 00:39:59,135
Speaker 1:  reluctant to give himself much credit, but I really do think he's a bigger

637
00:39:59,135 --> 00:40:00,495
Speaker 1:  part of it than it might seem.

638
00:40:01,175 --> 00:40:05,135
Speaker 9:  I think my job is to be very sort of

639
00:40:05,265 --> 00:40:08,895
Speaker 9:  optimistic and kind and make people feel

640
00:40:08,895 --> 00:40:12,735
Speaker 9:  comfortable and sort of try and bring out a positive like I'm

641
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:15,695
Speaker 9:  If you as you watch the show, you see 'em really smiley and I'm laughing

642
00:40:15,695 --> 00:40:18,855
Speaker 9:  and I'm giggling all the time. That's true. That is who my personality is.

643
00:40:18,855 --> 00:40:22,535
Speaker 9:  But I also think that that helps make the random person on the street comfortable.

644
00:40:22,765 --> 00:40:26,575
Speaker 9:  Like I'm not trying to play. Gotcha. I'm trying to encourage you

645
00:40:26,595 --> 00:40:29,855
Speaker 9:  to guess these songs correctly because when you get something right, you're

646
00:40:29,855 --> 00:40:32,815
Speaker 9:  excited and you're happy and you're like, oh wow, I just won five bucks.

647
00:40:33,195 --> 00:40:37,055
Speaker 9:  And then I can come in and say, so tell me about your life, like

648
00:40:37,055 --> 00:40:40,255
Speaker 9:  how did you grow up? Or tell me about your mom or whatever. And So I, it's

649
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:44,335
Speaker 9:  sometimes I refer to it as like a, the game show as a Trojan horse to

650
00:40:44,335 --> 00:40:48,255
Speaker 9:  get people to open up 'cause they're distracted by guessing songs

651
00:40:48,795 --> 00:40:51,255
Speaker 9:  and then they're much more comfortable and willing to talk about everything

652
00:40:51,255 --> 00:40:54,335
Speaker 9:  else, which is like eating the hot ones, eating the, the hotter they get,

653
00:40:54,335 --> 00:40:58,095
Speaker 9:  the more you're distracted by how spicy it is. So you talk about your feelings,

654
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:02,255
Speaker 9:  right? So I think that's probably a large part of my

655
00:41:02,255 --> 00:41:06,135
Speaker 9:  role and and where it comes from is my whole career of

656
00:41:06,135 --> 00:41:10,095
Speaker 9:  making videos and doing YouTube content. I've always been told the best

657
00:41:10,095 --> 00:41:13,055
Speaker 9:  part of what you do is when you're engaging and talking to regular people

658
00:41:13,155 --> 00:41:16,575
Speaker 9:  and and having that off the cuff conversation, you should lean into that.

659
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:20,095
Speaker 1:  This is the sneakiest thing about TrackStar and it's the thing that makes

660
00:41:20,095 --> 00:41:23,255
Speaker 1:  it different from so much music content out there.

661
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:26,855
Speaker 1:  It's actually really only a little tiny bit about the music.

662
00:41:27,605 --> 00:41:31,415
Speaker 1:  Jack seems to have always understood this thing as a conversation show

663
00:41:31,685 --> 00:41:35,285
Speaker 1:  with sort of a loose musicy structure rather than

664
00:41:35,645 --> 00:41:39,565
Speaker 1:  a thing where the music is the point. And honestly even the music

665
00:41:39,665 --> 00:41:43,565
Speaker 1:  he picks is meant to make that other dynamic work

666
00:41:43,565 --> 00:41:43,805
Speaker 1:  better.

667
00:41:44,665 --> 00:41:48,585
Speaker 9:  So before I go into it, or even at the beginning of the

668
00:41:48,585 --> 00:41:52,425
Speaker 9:  conversation, I'm asking about what do you listen to or what are some, who

669
00:41:52,425 --> 00:41:55,585
Speaker 9:  are some artists that have resonated with you or I research the celebrity

670
00:41:55,585 --> 00:41:59,505
Speaker 9:  and I try and find things that they're, they're they're gonna have an emotional

671
00:41:59,785 --> 00:42:03,625
Speaker 9:  response to and that helps open people up. Like, wait, you played

672
00:42:03,625 --> 00:42:07,105
Speaker 9:  this song? Like how do you know that this was like the song that I danced

673
00:42:07,105 --> 00:42:10,625
Speaker 9:  my first dance in my wedding? And so that's gonna trigger an emotional response.

674
00:42:11,845 --> 00:42:15,665
Speaker 9:  So that's the intention of the songs is to try and find things that remind

675
00:42:15,665 --> 00:42:19,625
Speaker 9:  people of, oh man, I used to listen to this with my dad when we were

676
00:42:19,845 --> 00:42:22,105
Speaker 9:  on the way to baseball practice. Well tell me about that.

677
00:42:23,805 --> 00:42:27,785
Speaker 9:  So I'm hoping that that's working. It's not easy to do like always on the

678
00:42:27,785 --> 00:42:30,705
Speaker 9:  spot, but that's what I'm a hundred percent striving for all the time.

679
00:42:31,225 --> 00:42:33,905
Speaker 1:  I feel like that has come up a bunch where you play a song for somebody and

680
00:42:33,905 --> 00:42:37,865
Speaker 1:  they're like, oh this is, this song indirectly inspired some

681
00:42:37,865 --> 00:42:40,985
Speaker 1:  other song that I wrote or was like meaningful to me as a teenager or whatever.

682
00:42:41,205 --> 00:42:45,025
Speaker 1:  And I always assumed that was mostly research, but

683
00:42:45,025 --> 00:42:48,585
Speaker 1:  it's, it's interesting that it's a mix of research and just sort of

684
00:42:49,015 --> 00:42:51,265
Speaker 1:  educational guesses about what music people like.

685
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:55,585
Speaker 9:  You'd be surprised how often I stumble into something that I had no,

686
00:42:55,985 --> 00:42:58,905
Speaker 9:  I didn't realize that there was all this meaning behind it. And that's like

687
00:42:58,925 --> 00:43:01,425
Speaker 9:  my favorite moments in doing the show

688
00:43:02,005 --> 00:43:05,775
Speaker 1:  If, you think about that, setup music as a way into other kinds

689
00:43:05,975 --> 00:43:09,815
Speaker 1:  of content and especially into personal conversation. You can go all

690
00:43:09,815 --> 00:43:13,775
Speaker 1:  sorts of ways and that in a nutshell appears to be the TrackStar plan.

691
00:43:14,305 --> 00:43:18,095
Speaker 9:  There have been lots of conversations about starting a record label

692
00:43:18,635 --> 00:43:22,575
Speaker 9:  really. So it's not like happening tomorrow, but it's definitely

693
00:43:22,575 --> 00:43:26,245
Speaker 9:  something that's TrackStar Records could happen.

694
00:43:27,165 --> 00:43:30,765
Speaker 1:  A that's a good name. Yeah, so that's good. What would that, why, why do

695
00:43:30,765 --> 00:43:31,885
Speaker 1:  a record label? What would that look like?

696
00:43:32,555 --> 00:43:36,525
Speaker 9:  Well there's, it's twofold. There's, because of the sessions that are happening

697
00:43:36,525 --> 00:43:40,045
Speaker 9:  in here, we have artists come in and do covers. So there's a lot of,

698
00:43:41,365 --> 00:43:45,045
Speaker 9:  I think a lot of covers are blowing up online and there's an

699
00:43:45,045 --> 00:43:48,645
Speaker 9:  opportunity there. Triple J is like releasing stuff and a few of those

700
00:43:49,635 --> 00:43:53,575
Speaker 9:  different online publishers have released songs in conjunction with

701
00:43:53,575 --> 00:43:56,095
Speaker 9:  artists. So there's an opportunity there. And then like you, like you talked

702
00:43:56,095 --> 00:44:00,015
Speaker 9:  about like discovering new artists, what if we, what if we got a pool of

703
00:44:00,015 --> 00:44:03,695
Speaker 9:  money together and we said we're gonna invest a million dollars in 10 artists

704
00:44:03,995 --> 00:44:07,295
Speaker 9:  and we're gonna tell the story of Track Star records through social media

705
00:44:07,445 --> 00:44:11,215
Speaker 9:  over the course of a year. And it's almost like how making the band was on

706
00:44:11,455 --> 00:44:13,655
Speaker 9:  MTV back in the day. Can we do that through social media?

707
00:44:14,695 --> 00:44:15,395
Speaker 1:  Do you think? You could?

708
00:44:16,065 --> 00:44:16,785
Speaker 9:  A hundred percent. Yeah.

709
00:44:17,465 --> 00:44:21,305
Speaker 1:  I watched making the band religiously back in the day when it was

710
00:44:21,305 --> 00:44:24,745
Speaker 1:  about creating the Band o town. And I swear to you, that show would

711
00:44:24,845 --> 00:44:28,665
Speaker 1:  100% work today. A super intense competition

712
00:44:28,665 --> 00:44:32,240
Speaker 1:  show. That's also a behind the scenes look at, at what it means to be a pop

713
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,125
Speaker 1:  star is like social media gold. Actually there

714
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:40,005
Speaker 1:  was recently a Netflix show about a K-pop group called Cat's Eye that

715
00:44:40,105 --> 00:44:43,885
Speaker 1:  was essentially that, but they also had this very public side of it where

716
00:44:43,885 --> 00:44:47,765
Speaker 1:  people were seeing the performances throughout the audition process. It was

717
00:44:47,835 --> 00:44:51,245
Speaker 1:  wild. the show is awesome. I would watch it a million more times, about a

718
00:44:51,245 --> 00:44:54,965
Speaker 1:  million more kinds of groups. There are other moves for

719
00:44:54,965 --> 00:44:58,725
Speaker 1:  TrackStar itself too, as it grows and becomes more of a business.

720
00:44:59,345 --> 00:45:03,205
Speaker 1:  One thing I see in the comments of the videos all the time is people discovering

721
00:45:03,205 --> 00:45:07,125
Speaker 1:  new songs thanks to TrackStar, the show does have an official Spotify

722
00:45:07,565 --> 00:45:11,005
Speaker 1:  playlist with all the songs, but there's definitely more it could do there

723
00:45:11,395 --> 00:45:15,365
Speaker 1:  because being a reliable source of new music or just a reliable

724
00:45:15,465 --> 00:45:19,125
Speaker 1:  way to make old songs cool again, makes you very powerful

725
00:45:19,265 --> 00:45:20,365
Speaker 1:  in the modern music world.

726
00:45:21,175 --> 00:45:24,625
Speaker 9:  It's like, it goes back to being a teenager and saying

727
00:45:25,295 --> 00:45:29,145
Speaker 9:  like, pass me the ox. Like I'm gonna play a song that's like,

728
00:45:29,445 --> 00:45:33,185
Speaker 9:  you guys are gonna love that. I think everyone has that like little piece

729
00:45:33,185 --> 00:45:35,785
Speaker 9:  of there where they wanna show their friends, like, check this song out.

730
00:45:35,785 --> 00:45:36,545
Speaker 9:  This is a great song.

731
00:45:38,225 --> 00:45:42,045
Speaker 9:  So yeah, huge part of why, why I do this and how I like to choose the song

732
00:45:42,045 --> 00:45:45,965
Speaker 9:  So. I just wanna play good stuff in terms of becoming a taste maker. Like

733
00:45:45,965 --> 00:45:47,405
Speaker 9:  if that's happening, that's great.

734
00:45:48,965 --> 00:45:52,205
Speaker 9:  I just want people to know about good music, I guess. And maybe there's a

735
00:45:52,205 --> 00:45:55,525
Speaker 9:  way to turn that into something that's a little bit more substantial or meaningful

736
00:45:55,585 --> 00:45:59,485
Speaker 9:  or focused specifically on that. I mean we have playlists on on our

737
00:45:59,485 --> 00:46:03,205
Speaker 9:  Spotify, like a bunch of different playlists, so there's some stuff there.

738
00:46:03,315 --> 00:46:06,565
Speaker 1:  Have you gotten labels or anything calling you being like, Hey, can you play

739
00:46:06,565 --> 00:46:07,845
Speaker 1:  this song during Track Star?

740
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:12,005
Speaker 9:  Yeah, all the time people ask us to play songs, but I can't just,

741
00:46:13,305 --> 00:46:16,325
Speaker 9:  the, the thing is a lot of times it's new songs, can you play this brand

742
00:46:16,325 --> 00:46:19,125
Speaker 9:  new song? I'm like, well how are people gonna know this song that like, no

743
00:46:19,125 --> 00:46:22,565
Speaker 9:  one, this artist just came out. It doesn't make any sense. Like, like I,

744
00:46:22,685 --> 00:46:25,325
Speaker 9:  I If, you wanna pay me to play The Beatles? I'll do that. And people are

745
00:46:25,325 --> 00:46:26,765
Speaker 9:  like, we're not gonna pay you to play the Beatles.

746
00:46:29,315 --> 00:46:29,845
Speaker 9:  Like, damn.

747
00:46:31,785 --> 00:46:35,405
Speaker 9:  So yeah, it's, it doesn't it, it's hard. You have to find things that like

748
00:46:35,405 --> 00:46:38,405
Speaker 9:  are universally recognized and tend, those tend to be things that people

749
00:46:38,405 --> 00:46:39,165
Speaker 9:  aren't promoting.

750
00:46:40,165 --> 00:46:43,605
Speaker 1:  Remember though, Jack is not a music guy that's important to all of this.

751
00:46:44,075 --> 00:46:48,005
Speaker 1:  He's a creator. He likes telling stories. Music is just a vehicle to get

752
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:51,885
Speaker 1:  there. TrackStar was just an excuse to talk to people about something they

753
00:46:51,885 --> 00:46:55,365
Speaker 1:  liked and cared about and knew everything else they're working on

754
00:46:55,785 --> 00:46:59,765
Speaker 1:  is the same way. And you know, if that happens to also double

755
00:46:59,825 --> 00:47:03,245
Speaker 1:  as a really fun game show to watch and a way for mega famous

756
00:47:03,245 --> 00:47:06,405
Speaker 1:  celebrities to be out and about and into music all the better.

757
00:47:07,305 --> 00:47:11,085
Speaker 1:  It really does feel to me like a throwback to the early two thousands when

758
00:47:11,085 --> 00:47:14,605
Speaker 1:  shows like TRL were all about making music feel like a hang.

759
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:18,645
Speaker 1:  And they understood before social media, before the

760
00:47:19,005 --> 00:47:22,925
Speaker 1:  internet made, everything about the individual people that getting to

761
00:47:22,925 --> 00:47:25,965
Speaker 1:  know the artists and getting to know what they liked and what they cared

762
00:47:25,965 --> 00:47:29,765
Speaker 1:  about and what inspired them was maybe even more important to

763
00:47:29,765 --> 00:47:33,645
Speaker 1:  liking their music than the music. Another show that

764
00:47:33,645 --> 00:47:37,205
Speaker 1:  I loved from around that time was popup video, which was adding trivia and

765
00:47:37,205 --> 00:47:40,965
Speaker 1:  jokes to music videos way before anyone was posting memes on Instagram.

766
00:47:41,695 --> 00:47:45,365
Speaker 1:  Popup video by the way, was apparently a big inspiration for TrackStar.

767
00:47:47,195 --> 00:47:50,445
Speaker 13:  What was the cute Beatle doing in a Tokyo jail cell?

768
00:47:52,185 --> 00:47:54,445
Speaker 13:  Should George Harrison get his own sit

769
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:58,565
Speaker 1:  TRL popup video making the band? The music industry has

770
00:47:58,565 --> 00:48:02,245
Speaker 1:  changed in countless ways in 20 years, but maybe it hasn't

771
00:48:02,245 --> 00:48:05,605
Speaker 1:  changed at all. And maybe if it has, we're going back

772
00:48:06,025 --> 00:48:09,045
Speaker 1:  to some things about the way that it was that maybe we never should have

773
00:48:09,045 --> 00:48:12,485
Speaker 1:  left in the first place. People are buying records again. They're listening

774
00:48:12,485 --> 00:48:16,205
Speaker 1:  to full albums to get away from the infinite playlisting of

775
00:48:16,205 --> 00:48:20,085
Speaker 1:  everything that thing Jack is talking about where you just hear music and

776
00:48:20,085 --> 00:48:22,645
Speaker 1:  you sort of know the sounds, but you don't know the artists, you don't know

777
00:48:22,645 --> 00:48:26,445
Speaker 1:  the lyrics. That just feels bad. I had a friend

778
00:48:26,465 --> 00:48:30,365
Speaker 1:  who used to call it Spotify music, music that's designed to not

779
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:33,765
Speaker 1:  bother you when you're not paying attention. And to be just interesting enough

780
00:48:33,765 --> 00:48:37,725
Speaker 1:  when you are to keep you hooked. That's not good music. That's

781
00:48:37,725 --> 00:48:41,485
Speaker 1:  Spotify music and I think people are pushing back toward looking for good

782
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:45,125
Speaker 1:  music. They're also, you know, rocking wired headphones and

783
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:49,165
Speaker 1:  they're looking for new ways to hang out with their favorite music and

784
00:48:49,445 --> 00:48:53,205
Speaker 1:  musicians and get to know them in new ways. It's new platforms,

785
00:48:53,265 --> 00:48:57,245
Speaker 1:  new hosts, new musicians, but the more things change, the more

786
00:48:57,245 --> 00:49:00,765
Speaker 1:  they say the same. I think that lines from a song actually.

787
00:49:01,315 --> 00:49:02,125
Speaker 1:  It's a good one.

788
00:49:03,755 --> 00:49:07,165
Speaker 1:  Alright, that is it for The Vergecast today. Thank you to Jack for being

789
00:49:07,165 --> 00:49:10,685
Speaker 1:  on the show with me today. And thank you as always for listening. There's

790
00:49:10,755 --> 00:49:13,725
Speaker 1:  lots more on everything we talked about at The Verge dot com. I'll put a

791
00:49:13,725 --> 00:49:17,165
Speaker 1:  bunch of links in the show notes. You should go watch TrackStar videos. They're

792
00:49:17,165 --> 00:49:21,125
Speaker 1:  super fun. I see a lot of people who will find one video and then

793
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,645
Speaker 1:  just go back to the very beginning of TrackStar and watch them all the way

794
00:49:23,645 --> 00:49:26,685
Speaker 1:  through. Super fun. I actually highly recommend doing so.

795
00:49:27,705 --> 00:49:31,205
Speaker 1:  As always, If you have thoughts, questions, feelings, or other

796

800
00:49:46,365 --> 00:49:49,405

801

807
00:50:11,325 --> 00:50:14,245
