00:00:02,595 --> 00:00:05,725
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Corporate in Fighting.

3
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:09,765
Speaker 2:  I'm your friend David Pierce and I am sitting on my back patio getting the

4
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:13,285
Speaker 2:  grill ready because it is July 4th weekend and that's just what you do.

5
00:00:13,475 --> 00:00:16,965
Speaker 2:  This is America. It's July 4th. It's also my birthday on

6
00:00:16,965 --> 00:00:20,845
Speaker 2:  July 4th. And so we sit outside and we grill even though it's

7
00:00:20,845 --> 00:00:24,045
Speaker 2:  very hot and there's mosquitoes everywhere. And would I rather be inside

8
00:00:24,145 --> 00:00:27,965
Speaker 2:  in the air conditioning looking at my television? Yes, but it's July 4th,

9
00:00:28,385 --> 00:00:31,885
Speaker 2:  so we're grilling stuff. Anyway, we have an awesome episode coming up for

10
00:00:31,885 --> 00:00:35,485
Speaker 2:  you today. We are gonna basically start a tech company together. Neil

11
00:00:35,575 --> 00:00:39,285
Speaker 2:  Appel, Alex Kranz and I are going to, as a group of

12
00:00:39,555 --> 00:00:43,445
Speaker 2:  CEOs, which couldn't possibly go poorly, figure out how we

13
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:47,285
Speaker 2:  would build a tech company out of the tech industry as it exists. Now, it

14
00:00:47,285 --> 00:00:49,845
Speaker 2:  sounds a little complicated, but I'll explain the rules when we get into

15
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:53,525
Speaker 2:  it. It'll all make sense. But basically I wanted to see if you were to start

16
00:00:53,525 --> 00:00:57,045
Speaker 2:  from scratch and say, okay, what are the best products in tech? What can

17
00:00:57,085 --> 00:01:00,085
Speaker 2:  I take? What can I put together? What could we build that would be cool and

18
00:01:00,085 --> 00:01:03,885
Speaker 2:  different and that we could make? Awesome. How would we do that? We had a

19
00:01:03,885 --> 00:01:06,365
Speaker 2:  lot of fun putting this together and figured this would be a fun time to

20
00:01:06,365 --> 00:01:10,085
Speaker 2:  do it. It's July. The news is a little bit slow. We're about to get

21
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:13,965
Speaker 2:  into Crazy Gadget season again. But it felt like a fun way to take

22
00:01:14,085 --> 00:01:17,805
Speaker 2:  a different kinda look at the tech industry. I should also say some

23
00:01:17,805 --> 00:01:21,445
Speaker 2:  credit for this whole concept goes to a podcast I really like called The

24
00:01:21,445 --> 00:01:25,365
Speaker 2:  Big Picture, really good show about movies. And they did one recently where

25
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:29,285
Speaker 2:  the two of them started their own studios together and they

26
00:01:29,285 --> 00:01:32,565
Speaker 2:  kind of did a draft and picked actors and writers and it was a very fun episode.

27
00:01:32,665 --> 00:01:36,565
Speaker 2:  And so I just kind of stole that concept and we're going to take it

28
00:01:36,565 --> 00:01:39,845
Speaker 2:  and turn it and do something similar on the show today. So we're gonna start

29
00:01:39,845 --> 00:01:43,245
Speaker 2:  a tech company. I'm very curious what you think as you listen to it. If you

30
00:01:43,245 --> 00:01:46,045
Speaker 2:  think we made bad decisions, if you think we made good decisions. If you

31
00:01:46,045 --> 00:01:49,485
Speaker 2:  think we're monsters, I wanna hear everything. Call the hotline. Eight six six

32
00:01:49,685 --> 00:01:53,485
Speaker 2:  VERGE one one. Email us Vergecast at The Verge dot com. Tell us how you'd

33
00:01:53,485 --> 00:01:57,125
Speaker 2:  start a tech company and maybe between us we're gonna take over the tech

34
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,645
Speaker 2:  industry. It's gonna be awesome. Anyway, all of that is coming up in just

35
00:02:00,685 --> 00:02:04,405
Speaker 2:  a second. But first I just noticed that I turned the grill on without

36
00:02:04,645 --> 00:02:08,165
Speaker 2:  actually turning the propane on. So this is how good I am at grilling. I'm

37
00:02:08,165 --> 00:02:10,685
Speaker 2:  gonna go fix that problem. This is The Verge Cast. We'll be right back.

38
00:03:28,155 --> 00:03:28,455
Speaker 2:  All right,

39
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:10,935
Speaker 2:  of other companies is essentially how this is gonna work. So I have, I think

40
00:04:10,935 --> 00:04:14,575
Speaker 2:  it's either 10 or 11 categories here that we as a, as a tech company

41
00:04:14,915 --> 00:04:18,415
Speaker 2:  are going to enter by taking that product from another company.

42
00:04:18,785 --> 00:04:22,695
Speaker 2:  There are several rules. Again, this is very convoluted. Yeah. But it's

43
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:26,095
Speaker 2:  gonna work. It's gonna be fine once we get into it. Everything we take from

44
00:04:26,095 --> 00:04:29,615
Speaker 2:  a tech company, we get, as it exists right now, whatever it's selling,

45
00:04:30,045 --> 00:04:33,975
Speaker 2:  whoever it is that makes it all the factory deals, all the marketing stuff,

46
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:37,095
Speaker 2:  everything we can, we can change it as we like, but we get, we don't get

47
00:04:37,095 --> 00:04:40,895
Speaker 2:  the idea of it. We get the thing as it is right now. We only care

48
00:04:40,895 --> 00:04:44,575
Speaker 2:  about things up to 2030 after that. Who knows We're all gonna live on Mars.

49
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:48,375
Speaker 2:  So we're, we're playing like a six year long game here. And frankly, if we

50
00:04:48,435 --> 00:04:52,375
Speaker 2:  as the triumvirate of CEOs last until 2030, we will have been wildly

51
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:52,935
Speaker 2:  successful.

52
00:04:53,115 --> 00:04:56,375
Speaker 5:  I'm banking out really fast. Yeah. As soon as we IPO I'm gone. I'm

53
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:59,615
Speaker 2:  Sorry. Alex is resting investing from like day one here. It's, it's gonna

54
00:04:59,615 --> 00:05:03,295
Speaker 2:  be great. We can spend as much money as we want, but making money

55
00:05:03,635 --> 00:05:07,135
Speaker 2:  is not the point. We're actually not gonna talk about money at all on this

56
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:10,895
Speaker 2:  show. Okay? We don't wanna go out of business. But our main goal

57
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:14,335
Speaker 2:  is just to build the greatest tech company in the history of the universe.

58
00:05:14,405 --> 00:05:18,015
Speaker 2:  Like that. That is what we're after here. Because this is like, if we start

59
00:05:18,015 --> 00:05:20,535
Speaker 2:  talking about the money side of things, it just gets weird and complicated

60
00:05:20,555 --> 00:05:22,255
Speaker 2:  in ways that we don't have time for. That's what

61
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:25,175
Speaker 6:  We're gonna tell our investors. We're just gonna be like, look guys, if we

62
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:28,375
Speaker 6:  talk about money, this is gonna get weird and complicated. Yeah. So just,

63
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:29,615
Speaker 6:  you just relax, we're

64
00:05:29,615 --> 00:05:31,775
Speaker 5:  Just out to make an a GI don't worry about it. I guess.

65
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:35,015
Speaker 2:  Yeah, like for 20 years Jeff Bezos was like, I can make money whenever I

66
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:37,815
Speaker 2:  feel like it for now I'm just gonna like make cool stuff. Like that's the

67
00:05:37,815 --> 00:05:41,655
Speaker 2:  vibe at our tech company. And I would say the two most important

68
00:05:41,655 --> 00:05:45,375
Speaker 2:  things as we pick here are we can only take one product

69
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:49,455
Speaker 2:  from each company. So once, once we have used something from

70
00:05:49,505 --> 00:05:53,375
Speaker 2:  Apple, we cannot use anything else from Apple or Samsung or Google or whoever

71
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:57,015
Speaker 2:  else. One product per company, which I think is gonna be very complicated.

72
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:01,205
Speaker 2:  That product also cannot be the whole company. So if, if there is a

73
00:06:01,205 --> 00:06:05,165
Speaker 2:  company that makes a single product with its name, like I originally had

74
00:06:05,655 --> 00:06:09,205
Speaker 2:  Figma in one of our categories as like a thing we might want to take. But

75
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:11,765
Speaker 2:  if you take Figma from Figma, there is no Figma anymore. So that doesn't

76
00:06:11,765 --> 00:06:12,325
Speaker 2:  count. Well

77
00:06:12,325 --> 00:06:13,605
Speaker 6:  What about, what about Fig Jam?

78
00:06:15,195 --> 00:06:18,085
Speaker 6:  Sure. Moving right along. Yes,

79
00:06:18,355 --> 00:06:21,965
Speaker 2:  Sure. That's actually, I'll give you that. Another one I had is like,

80
00:06:22,145 --> 00:06:25,485
Speaker 2:  oh here's a good example. Like we can't take Salesforce from Salesforce,

81
00:06:25,545 --> 00:06:27,285
Speaker 2:  but we could take Slack from Salesforce.

82
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:30,725
Speaker 6:  Oh, I see. So if Apple had a product called Apple, you would just be like,

83
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:31,365
Speaker 6:  no. That

84
00:06:31,365 --> 00:06:35,125
Speaker 2:  Accounted for, you know, 98% of its revenue. Yeah. So, sure. I guess under

85
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:39,085
Speaker 2:  that rule we can take fig jam, I'll add fig Jam back to the

86
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:42,765
Speaker 2:  list. And most importantly, this is not competitive. We are

87
00:06:42,815 --> 00:06:46,405
Speaker 2:  three CEOs. We are doing this together. And so we have to agree on everything

88
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:49,965
Speaker 2:  that we're going to take. Which I assume means this is going to take 12 hours.

89
00:06:50,705 --> 00:06:53,445
Speaker 5:  Is there such thing as a hung jury in this situation?

90
00:06:53,985 --> 00:06:57,485
Speaker 2:  No, because there are three of us and if it comes to it, we will vote and

91
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,765
Speaker 2:  two to one will win. Yeah. This is why we have three CEOs. This is, it's

92
00:07:00,765 --> 00:07:02,725
Speaker 2:  a perfect, I can't believe no one has thought of this before.

93
00:07:02,725 --> 00:07:04,845
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Why? Why are people doing one and two

94
00:07:05,265 --> 00:07:08,925
Speaker 2:  Odd number? CEOs solves all your problems. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Here are the

95
00:07:08,925 --> 00:07:12,725
Speaker 2:  categories. We're gonna do smartphones, tablets, and PCs. Then we're gonna

96
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:16,565
Speaker 2:  take a break. We're gonna do wearables, headphones, app platforms,

97
00:07:16,565 --> 00:07:20,525
Speaker 2:  which is not specific apps, but think of like app businesses, like

98
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:24,365
Speaker 2:  Microsoft Office is one of the options in that category. And then we're going

99
00:07:24,365 --> 00:07:27,445
Speaker 2:  to do what I have called boring B2B money faucets, which is the thing that

100
00:07:27,445 --> 00:07:29,925
Speaker 2:  makes you all the money that nobody ever wants to talk about. Then we're

101
00:07:29,925 --> 00:07:33,285
Speaker 2:  gonna take another break and then we're gonna do messaging, streaming service,

102
00:07:33,795 --> 00:07:36,765
Speaker 2:  wild card gadgets, and wild card everything else. And then we're gonna get

103
00:07:36,765 --> 00:07:39,005
Speaker 2:  outta here and we're gonna go be filthy rich. Sound good?

104
00:07:39,345 --> 00:07:40,325
Speaker 5:  I'm so excited to be rich.

105
00:07:40,595 --> 00:07:44,445
Speaker 2:  Alright. Category number one is smartphones. This to me is maybe the

106
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:47,685
Speaker 2:  easiest but also maybe the most difficult one to do first, which is why I

107
00:07:47,685 --> 00:07:49,005
Speaker 2:  wanted it to do it first.

108
00:07:49,505 --> 00:07:53,085
Speaker 5:  See, I, I also agree with you 'cause I think we're probably along the same

109
00:07:53,085 --> 00:07:54,405
Speaker 5:  lines for what the phone should be.

110
00:07:54,715 --> 00:07:57,605
Speaker 6:  Well it, the only thing that makes it different is David told us not to worry

111
00:07:57,605 --> 00:07:57,885
Speaker 6:  about money.

112
00:07:57,985 --> 00:07:58,965
Speaker 2:  Oh, interesting. We

113
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:00,205
Speaker 5:  Don't worry about money. Well

114
00:08:00,205 --> 00:08:03,605
Speaker 6:  If you give one wit about money, you take the iPhone. Yes. Right? Because

115
00:08:03,605 --> 00:08:06,445
Speaker 6:  then you then now you funded whatever other boondoggles you want to get on.

116
00:08:06,925 --> 00:08:09,645
Speaker 6:  Like Yeah. Then we can pick the Cobo for tablets and it's fine.

117
00:08:09,745 --> 00:08:12,965
Speaker 5:  That's what we should do. Exactly. You're you're right on the same wave

118
00:08:13,195 --> 00:08:16,845
Speaker 6:  Link. But if you don't care about money, then you might have a substantive

119
00:08:16,845 --> 00:08:18,805
Speaker 6:  discussion about what phone you want. Well,

120
00:08:18,805 --> 00:08:21,085
Speaker 2:  So, okay, let me, let me frame this slightly differently. We don't care,

121
00:08:21,345 --> 00:08:24,685
Speaker 2:  we are not spending our time thinking about quarterly earnings and shareholder

122
00:08:24,685 --> 00:08:28,245
Speaker 2:  value, but we do wanna win Right In like big picture win

123
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:30,845
Speaker 6:  Then we're taking the iPhone. Yeah, I've already, I've crushed you.

124
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,325
Speaker 5:  We're taking the iPhone. We win.

125
00:08:32,565 --> 00:08:35,525
Speaker 2:  I think that's right. I think the only reason for me that the iPhone is challenging

126
00:08:35,525 --> 00:08:39,205
Speaker 2:  is that there are a lot of categories here in which Apple is also very good

127
00:08:39,225 --> 00:08:41,845
Speaker 2:  and some in which it has a lot less competition. Oh

128
00:08:41,845 --> 00:08:45,725
Speaker 6:  No, no. I can, every other category I can, I can defeat everyone

129
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,485
Speaker 6:  else with the power of the iPhones lockin.

130
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:48,765
Speaker 2:  Oh, interesting.

131
00:08:49,065 --> 00:08:52,645
Speaker 6:  Do you trust me? You just wait God And I'm allowed to change stuff.

132
00:08:53,155 --> 00:08:55,205
Speaker 6:  Yeah, we're good. We nailed it. It's fine.

133
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:59,365
Speaker 2:  Oh my God. I just realized we're gonna speed run building an app

134
00:08:59,465 --> 00:09:01,245
Speaker 2:  tax out of Yeah, it's,

135
00:09:01,245 --> 00:09:04,045
Speaker 6:  It's gonna go so fast. You think I don't care about money David.

136
00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:07,085
Speaker 6:  45%. Let's

137
00:09:07,105 --> 00:09:09,805
Speaker 2:  Go. Yeah, somewhere. Le Conn just started listening to this and she's like,

138
00:09:09,805 --> 00:09:10,125
Speaker 2:  this is,

139
00:09:10,255 --> 00:09:12,045
Speaker 6:  She's like, this isn't the tech company I would've built.

140
00:09:12,665 --> 00:09:12,885
Speaker 2:  We

141
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,365
Speaker 5:  Were not even gonna be allowed to make a company. Lena Conn's. Like, Nope,

142
00:09:15,385 --> 00:09:15,885
Speaker 5:  no, not

143
00:09:15,885 --> 00:09:17,205
Speaker 6:  This person. Your fake company is illegal, sir.

144
00:09:18,445 --> 00:09:22,285
Speaker 2:  Okay. But just for this, for the sake of argument, the other nominees

145
00:09:22,285 --> 00:09:25,805
Speaker 2:  that I had here were Samsung, which I think is probably the only other

146
00:09:25,805 --> 00:09:29,205
Speaker 2:  reasonable competitor here. The Google Pixel. If you're, you know, feeling

147
00:09:29,205 --> 00:09:32,565
Speaker 2:  good about yourself, the nothing phone, which is a fun, like dark horse if

148
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:35,405
Speaker 2:  you wanna like bet on doing something weird and cool in the next six years

149
00:09:35,405 --> 00:09:39,325
Speaker 2:  until 2030. Interesting bet. Huawei one plus Asus

150
00:09:39,325 --> 00:09:41,565
Speaker 2:  Motorola, like, it gets bleak pretty fast.

151
00:09:42,355 --> 00:09:45,165
Speaker 6:  Real fast. Were you hoping that one of us would be like Motorola?

152
00:09:45,565 --> 00:09:49,365
Speaker 2:  I was hoping one of you would fight for Samsung to be honest, just because

153
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:53,565
Speaker 2:  I think it's possible to maybe want to pick an Apple product in another one.

154
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:56,205
Speaker 2:  'cause we've now ruled out every other Apple product. No, 'cause

155
00:09:56,205 --> 00:09:58,885
Speaker 5:  I'm looking it through the rest and I'm like, I'm like, there's other really

156
00:09:58,885 --> 00:10:02,725
Speaker 5:  good competitors in these other places. Okay. But like the iPhone, if you're,

157
00:10:02,725 --> 00:10:05,925
Speaker 5:  if if the phone is like the engine of the business,

158
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:10,205
Speaker 5:  which it feels like probably is true, then we want the iPhone.

159
00:10:10,405 --> 00:10:13,725
Speaker 6:  I mean alternatively the, the one that I would've argued for would've been

160
00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:17,565
Speaker 6:  the pixel because then the one thing you would change about it would be caring

161
00:10:18,245 --> 00:10:20,445
Speaker 6:  and then, and then it would be good. Yeah.

162
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:20,605
Speaker 2:  But

163
00:10:20,665 --> 00:10:23,805
Speaker 5:  The iPhone we've got like the people who are making the good processors on

164
00:10:23,805 --> 00:10:26,365
Speaker 5:  the iPhone. Whereas the Pixel we've got not that,

165
00:10:26,905 --> 00:10:30,045
Speaker 6:  But sure. But you know, a little, a little caring goes a long way. Yeah,

166
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:33,565
Speaker 6:  that's true. That's true. Like also trying to market the phone would be useful.

167
00:10:33,805 --> 00:10:37,245
Speaker 2:  I mean, yeah, like in, in terms of raw upside, the

168
00:10:37,365 --> 00:10:41,085
Speaker 2:  ROII think for the Pixel would be huge. Whereas the iPhone, I have a hard

169
00:10:41,085 --> 00:10:44,965
Speaker 2:  time imagining making the iPhone more successful. But it's also very successful.

170
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,125
Speaker 2:  I think the answer is just the iPhone. I don't know that we need to talk

171
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:47,725
Speaker 2:  about this much longer.

172
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:49,925
Speaker 6:  It's gonna solve every other problem on this list.

173
00:10:50,105 --> 00:10:53,685
Speaker 2:  So again, I would, I would remind you that one of the things we are not trying

174
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:56,405
Speaker 2:  to do here is build a services business or a monopoly.

175
00:10:57,235 --> 00:11:01,125
Speaker 6:  Wait, we, we are not trying to build a monopoly. We wanna win. Hmm. So you're

176
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:04,885
Speaker 6:  saying this collection of three CEOs has to have some values? Yeah,

177
00:11:05,045 --> 00:11:08,085
Speaker 2:  We wanna like be cool. Our main value is like be cool.

178
00:11:08,315 --> 00:11:11,965
Speaker 6:  Okay. I want to have a monopoly in a cool way. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Fair.

179
00:11:12,155 --> 00:11:13,205
Speaker 6:  Okay, we, we can move

180
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:16,805
Speaker 2:  On. All right. So the iPhone next up tablets, which is

181
00:11:16,805 --> 00:11:20,685
Speaker 2:  ironically a very similar set of companies, but I would say that we, we can't

182
00:11:20,685 --> 00:11:24,245
Speaker 2:  pick the iPad. So the iPad is out, which leaves us with the four

183
00:11:24,245 --> 00:11:27,925
Speaker 2:  nominees I picked so far. Were the Samsung Galaxy

184
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:31,765
Speaker 2:  tabs, the Google Pixel tablet such as it is Amazon's

185
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:35,325
Speaker 2:  whole Kindle lineup, which I think counts as a tablet. Cobo, you could do

186
00:11:35,325 --> 00:11:38,765
Speaker 2:  one plus there's a lot of tablets out there. We could argue about the Microsoft

187
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:41,965
Speaker 2:  Surface as a tablet line, but I think, I won't count that. We'll get to that

188
00:11:41,965 --> 00:11:44,165
Speaker 2:  in a minute. What do you guys think? Who's the favorite here?

189
00:11:44,725 --> 00:11:48,685
Speaker 5:  I think we go with the books and then we have the Apple, the iPhone

190
00:11:48,685 --> 00:11:50,885
Speaker 5:  team make the operating system good.

191
00:11:51,315 --> 00:11:54,405
Speaker 6:  Wait, is that, can You, can you make that choice? Can I pick the Galaxy?

192
00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:55,685
Speaker 6:  But it runs iPad os.

193
00:11:55,945 --> 00:11:58,885
Speaker 2:  No, but it, but if we don't take the iPad, we don't get iPad os we're

194
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,765
Speaker 5:  Gonna use iOS to put on, put that on the books.

195
00:12:01,825 --> 00:12:04,365
Speaker 6:  Oh and then I didn't, we didn't take Mac Os which would've been the real

196
00:12:04,365 --> 00:12:06,485
Speaker 6:  move. We can't, huh?

197
00:12:06,755 --> 00:12:07,485
Speaker 2:  Yeah. See

198
00:12:07,985 --> 00:12:11,165
Speaker 6:  So wait, so wait, hold on to wind this. Put a red

199
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:13,685
Speaker 2:  On all of this To get an iPad running Mac os

200
00:12:14,045 --> 00:12:17,885
Speaker 6:  I have to like take the pixel so I can take the MacBook so

201
00:12:17,925 --> 00:12:20,485
Speaker 6:  I can take the Samsung Galaxy and make it run Mac os

202
00:12:21,785 --> 00:12:25,725
Speaker 6:  to get to a Galaxy pad running Mac os I have to take the Pixel and then a

203
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:26,605
Speaker 6:  MacBook. That would be

204
00:12:26,605 --> 00:12:28,645
Speaker 2:  The way. I'm gonna be honest, I don't hate that strategy.

205
00:12:30,245 --> 00:12:33,245
Speaker 6:  I feel like the board of directors meeting will be very confusing.

206
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:37,925
Speaker 6:  No, I'm with, I'm with Krantz. I think you take the Kindle lineup, you jazz

207
00:12:37,945 --> 00:12:40,645
Speaker 6:  up the software a little bit. People are happy. I

208
00:12:40,645 --> 00:12:44,365
Speaker 5:  Wanted to go books to get Escape the lock-in. 'cause I feel like we save

209
00:12:44,365 --> 00:12:46,445
Speaker 5:  some money with that acquisition. But

210
00:12:46,445 --> 00:12:49,485
Speaker 2:  We can solve the lock-in, remember Android is open source. So Android is

211
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:51,525
Speaker 2:  fair game. no matter what we do, we can just have Android,

212
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:53,605
Speaker 6:  We can un DRM the books is what you're saying.

213
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:57,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. And I think, so then the real question is like, who, who is better

214
00:12:57,045 --> 00:13:00,965
Speaker 2:  at making the hardware that we can take and have a pretty solid lead

215
00:13:00,965 --> 00:13:04,365
Speaker 2:  on? And I feel like, I feel like it's Amazon. Like books does cool stuff,

216
00:13:04,665 --> 00:13:07,765
Speaker 2:  but I feel like if we, we just steal the Amazon team and we're like, what

217
00:13:07,765 --> 00:13:09,605
Speaker 2:  if we did a good job again? Yeah.

218
00:13:09,845 --> 00:13:11,285
Speaker 5:  'cause we get, we get Panos. Oh

219
00:13:11,285 --> 00:13:12,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah, we get Panos.

220
00:13:12,195 --> 00:13:13,645
Speaker 5:  Yeah, we're doing the Kindle. That's right.

221
00:13:13,885 --> 00:13:14,965
Speaker 2:  I feel good about that. Yeah.

222
00:13:14,965 --> 00:13:16,605
Speaker 5:  We're doing the Kindle and we're gonna make it good now

223
00:13:16,635 --> 00:13:18,325
Speaker 6:  It's a real culture hire right there. Yeah.

224
00:13:18,545 --> 00:13:22,245
Speaker 2:  Do we immediately kill the whole Kindle fire line? Yes. And we just focus

225
00:13:22,245 --> 00:13:23,205
Speaker 2:  on E Inc. No, no,

226
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:27,085
Speaker 6:  No. That's good for kids. Okay, so actually I would say we take the, the

227
00:13:27,085 --> 00:13:30,165
Speaker 6:  tablet thing we're taking is like the extended Kindle. The

228
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:31,885
Speaker 2:  Kindle universe we get Yeah.

229
00:13:31,885 --> 00:13:35,285
Speaker 6:  Yeah. All this class of ca tablets is accomplishing for anyone is

230
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:38,925
Speaker 6:  playing Disney Plus for your children. So we're just like, the Kindle Fire

231
00:13:39,275 --> 00:13:42,765
Speaker 6:  kids is the centerpiece of our tablet strategy.

232
00:13:43,145 --> 00:13:43,365
Speaker 6:  And

233
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:46,365
Speaker 5:  Then we also just make a nice e-reader on the side that runs iOS.

234
00:13:46,365 --> 00:13:48,925
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And then I can go to various state capitals and be like, you want,

235
00:13:48,945 --> 00:13:52,885
Speaker 6:  you wanna make laws protecting kids make a law saying you have to buy a Kindle

236
00:13:52,885 --> 00:13:53,445
Speaker 6:  fire for kids.

237
00:13:53,835 --> 00:13:57,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah. There we go. I mean, I love how we're like making a really good

238
00:13:57,765 --> 00:14:00,645
Speaker 5:  culturally important company that also doesn't break laws.

239
00:14:01,305 --> 00:14:03,805
Speaker 6:  I'm not trying to break the laws. I'm trying to make the laws. Yeah.

240
00:14:04,065 --> 00:14:05,045
Speaker 2:  I'm trying to be the laws.

241
00:14:05,825 --> 00:14:08,965
Speaker 6:  Do you understand if you don't buy a Kindle fire, you will be arrested.

242
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:13,685
Speaker 2:  Here is my question is, do we reboot the fire phone with our

243
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:14,245
Speaker 2:  iPhone team?

244
00:14:16,695 --> 00:14:18,045
Speaker 6:  Which part are we like the

245
00:14:18,045 --> 00:14:19,085
Speaker 5:  3D display. We've

246
00:14:19,085 --> 00:14:22,925
Speaker 6:  Already added 50 cameras to the phone. What if we had four more to make

247
00:14:22,925 --> 00:14:23,925
Speaker 6:  it 3D? Yeah.

248
00:14:24,105 --> 00:14:27,965
Speaker 2:  And it's one of them is just for barcodes. Yeah. Amazon Kindle easy choice.

249
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:31,965
Speaker 2:  Next up is PCs. And I think the list of folks is fairly

250
00:14:32,325 --> 00:14:33,445
Speaker 2:  familiar here. Alex, what do you got?

251
00:14:33,675 --> 00:14:37,285
Speaker 5:  Okay, so the list is, it's, it's, we can't do Apple, but we got Microsoft,

252
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:41,525
Speaker 5:  Lenovo, Seus, aer, hp, razor Dell. I think

253
00:14:41,525 --> 00:14:45,245
Speaker 5:  we should go Lenovo because if you, you get rid of all of the spam wear

254
00:14:45,675 --> 00:14:49,525
Speaker 5:  that they like automatically install. You have some really nice laptops.

255
00:14:49,665 --> 00:14:49,885
Speaker 5:  You

256
00:14:49,885 --> 00:14:51,445
Speaker 6:  Got really nice hardware. Yeah, you

257
00:14:51,445 --> 00:14:55,085
Speaker 5:  Got really nice hardware. And then we make the iOS team,

258
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:59,005
Speaker 5:  they're gonna be working nights, but they're gonna have to basically like

259
00:15:00,005 --> 00:15:02,325
Speaker 5:  reinvent Mac os like they, they can figure it out.

260
00:15:02,505 --> 00:15:05,485
Speaker 6:  You can back into it. You start iOS started with Mac Os and you're like,

261
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:06,645
Speaker 6:  go the other way. Go

262
00:15:06,645 --> 00:15:10,365
Speaker 5:  The other way. I I I fully believe in them. If we can make PC

263
00:15:10,365 --> 00:15:11,525
Speaker 5:  clones, we can do this too.

264
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:14,925
Speaker 6:  But we don't have the chips. I guess we do. 'cause we have the iPhone. So

265
00:15:14,925 --> 00:15:18,165
Speaker 6:  now we're just, now we just put a, a hinge and a lid on an iPhone. We're

266
00:15:18,165 --> 00:15:22,085
Speaker 6:  like, that's a laptop. Yeah. Which is more or less the iPad. I just

267
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:24,605
Speaker 6:  wanna be very clear about what we're discussing. We're like, we make iPads

268
00:15:24,605 --> 00:15:25,485
Speaker 6:  now, but it's

269
00:15:25,485 --> 00:15:27,685
Speaker 5:  Also got the little, it's got the little the dot

270
00:15:28,105 --> 00:15:31,525
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah, the little, the Trackpad guy. Yeah. I see. I was gonna say Microsoft.

271
00:15:31,725 --> 00:15:34,325
Speaker 6:  'cause you I want control of the operating system. That's

272
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,165
Speaker 2:  Where I go to. Right.

273
00:15:36,165 --> 00:15:39,845
Speaker 6:  And I want the surface line. I don't, now I've pulled the tablet

274
00:15:40,275 --> 00:15:43,245
Speaker 6:  ecosystem bigger, right? Yeah. I've got my, my Kindles and my Kindle fires

275
00:15:43,245 --> 00:15:46,925
Speaker 6:  and I've got the Surface Pro and I've got a whole range of products.

276
00:15:47,115 --> 00:15:50,565
Speaker 5:  Tell us about all of the really good laptops and all-in-ones

277
00:15:50,835 --> 00:15:53,245
Speaker 5:  that, that we're gonna get with our Microsoft acquisition.

278
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:56,845
Speaker 6:  So here again, a lot of my strategy is just try hard. Okay.

279
00:15:57,045 --> 00:16:00,765
Speaker 6:  Right. Just to be clear. So yeah. The Surface Studio, but like what if you

280
00:16:00,765 --> 00:16:04,565
Speaker 6:  put a real chip in it? Mm huh And that's just me and meetings

281
00:16:04,835 --> 00:16:08,765
Speaker 6:  like what if circle this on the whiteboard and then write, try hard and

282
00:16:08,765 --> 00:16:12,285
Speaker 6:  then like three exclamation points. And that's my whole surface strategy.

283
00:16:12,665 --> 00:16:14,085
Speaker 5:  We can make it all run risk v

284
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:19,405
Speaker 6:  With like the power of one Raspberry Pi four. Yeah, my

285
00:16:19,405 --> 00:16:23,365
Speaker 6:  vote. We, David, you're the tiebreaker here. It's between Microsoft and Lenovo.

286
00:16:23,725 --> 00:16:25,885
Speaker 6:  I agree. Lenovo makes some of the, the better hardware here.

287
00:16:26,245 --> 00:16:29,845
Speaker 5:  You make a compelling point about being able to have Windows and make it

288
00:16:29,845 --> 00:16:30,045
Speaker 5:  good.

289
00:16:30,265 --> 00:16:34,085
Speaker 2:  The one wrench I would like to throw in is that if we get Dell, we just instantly

290
00:16:34,115 --> 00:16:37,325
Speaker 2:  have the best lineup of Windows PCs that exists.

291
00:16:37,985 --> 00:16:39,645
Speaker 6:  But we don't have Windows. We don't have

292
00:16:39,645 --> 00:16:41,045
Speaker 2:  Windows. Do we want windows?

293
00:16:41,545 --> 00:16:44,485
Speaker 6:  You know, like for example, like, I would like to walk up to the box that

294
00:16:44,485 --> 00:16:47,405
Speaker 6:  says like security and Right. Try hard.

295
00:16:47,645 --> 00:16:50,445
Speaker 2:  I will say though, under the rules of this game though, I don't, we, I think

296
00:16:50,445 --> 00:16:53,405
Speaker 2:  what we're getting is like a perpetual license to Windows. I don't think

297
00:16:53,405 --> 00:16:53,685
Speaker 2:  we're getting

298
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:56,005
Speaker 6:  Even inside my, that's probably how the service team, yeah. I

299
00:16:56,005 --> 00:16:57,085
Speaker 2:  Don't think we get to run Windows,

300
00:16:57,585 --> 00:17:00,085
Speaker 6:  But so when we took the iPhone, we don't get to run iOS. No,

301
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,285
Speaker 5:  We do. That one counts. It

302
00:17:02,285 --> 00:17:05,405
Speaker 2:  Does, it feels different. I can't describe to you why. No, it's because it's,

303
00:17:05,405 --> 00:17:09,165
Speaker 2:  it's one device to one operating system. This is not one device to one operating

304
00:17:09,165 --> 00:17:12,965
Speaker 2:  system. We are a partner to the operating system, not the only venue for

305
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,005
Speaker 2:  the operating system. Even

306
00:17:14,005 --> 00:17:15,285
Speaker 6:  If we're Microsoft, we're

307
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:18,725
Speaker 2:  Not. But we're the Surface team. We aren't Microsoft, we're Vergecast incorporated.

308
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:20,845
Speaker 2:  We're not taking Windows from Microsoft.

309
00:17:21,345 --> 00:17:21,565
Speaker 6:  Ah.

310
00:17:22,405 --> 00:17:26,205
Speaker 2:  I still think it's Microsoft just because I think we're, we're clearly building

311
00:17:26,725 --> 00:17:30,405
Speaker 2:  a luxury thing here. And I think getting there with Lenovo

312
00:17:30,985 --> 00:17:33,445
Speaker 2:  is gonna be challenging. Like, I don't, I don't know how we're gonna convince

313
00:17:33,445 --> 00:17:36,805
Speaker 2:  everybody that Lenovo is like, kick ass cool again. I think we can get there

314
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:37,605
Speaker 2:  with Surface. Well,

315
00:17:37,605 --> 00:17:40,365
Speaker 6:  No, but we are not. We're we're not Lenovo. We're just, we're just taking

316
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:41,925
Speaker 6:  the product. We're doing a little rebrand. You

317
00:17:41,925 --> 00:17:42,925
Speaker 5:  Got the think pad. Yeah,

318
00:17:42,925 --> 00:17:44,325
Speaker 6:  You're right. We wearing a little coat of paint on there.

319
00:17:44,465 --> 00:17:48,365
Speaker 2:  Get the yogas. So you guys want some yogas? Yeah, they do the flippy

320
00:17:48,365 --> 00:17:52,205
Speaker 2:  things. I'm gonna make tent mode happen for America. Okay. I'm, I'm

321
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:55,525
Speaker 2:  going Lenovo, because I think we're gonna want Microsoft later. I think there

322
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:58,685
Speaker 2:  are other things in this list that are going to be more useful to have for

323
00:17:58,885 --> 00:18:00,645
Speaker 2:  Microsoft. So I think we should pick Lenovo.

324
00:18:00,785 --> 00:18:02,045
Speaker 5:  You're right. That's true.

325
00:18:02,945 --> 00:18:05,245
Speaker 2:  I'm dying to know what you think those things are, but we'll come back to

326
00:18:05,245 --> 00:18:08,925
Speaker 2:  it. Think of all the boring things that make you the most valuable company

327
00:18:08,985 --> 00:18:12,845
Speaker 2:  on planet Earth. And that's, that's what Microsoft does so

328
00:18:12,845 --> 00:18:13,045
Speaker 2:  well.

329
00:18:13,395 --> 00:18:14,805
Speaker 5:  It's not the surface team.

330
00:18:14,955 --> 00:18:17,725
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I think. All right, so we're, we're picking, we're picking Lenovo.

331
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:21,725
Speaker 2:  Welcome to the team. The little nub. It's very, what's that thing called?

332
00:18:21,825 --> 00:18:23,685
Speaker 2:  The track point? Is that what that's called? Track

333
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,805
Speaker 5:  Point. Track point. Love that thing. We just call it a nub. That's it's a

334
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:30,525
Speaker 5:  nub. We're rebranding it immediately. Just immediate. That's the first thing

335
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:31,325
Speaker 5:  we do. Day one.

336
00:18:31,555 --> 00:18:35,445
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I love this. Alright, so just to recap so far, we're gonna take

337
00:18:35,445 --> 00:18:39,365
Speaker 2:  a quick break. We have, as Vergecast incorporated, we now make the

338
00:18:39,365 --> 00:18:43,325
Speaker 2:  Apple iPhone, the Amazon, Kindle, and Lenovo's set of

339
00:18:43,785 --> 00:18:44,405
Speaker 2:  PCs. I feel

340
00:22:49,515 --> 00:22:52,955
Speaker 2:  company I thought of when I said wearable out loud to myself. What do you

341
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:56,115
Speaker 2:  guys think? Any, any jump out to you that we should definitely get into?

342
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:57,875
Speaker 2:  I have a clear favorite here

343
00:22:58,135 --> 00:23:01,315
Speaker 6:  Out the gate. I'm going bold and taking Meta for the Ray bands. Oh,

344
00:23:01,425 --> 00:23:04,595
Speaker 5:  Okay. Ooh, that's a good plan. I wasn't even, I was thinking of the, the,

345
00:23:04,655 --> 00:23:06,235
Speaker 5:  the headset. I forgot about the glasses.

346
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:10,435
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Okay. On that front, do we get one or the other or do we get both?

347
00:23:10,705 --> 00:23:14,355
Speaker 2:  Like if we, if we say Quest, we get all the quests in one

348
00:23:14,355 --> 00:23:17,115
Speaker 2:  product, but I feel like the smart glasses are a different thing.

349
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:20,355
Speaker 6:  Get your face computers away from me. Okay. You know what I mean? Just that.

350
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,475
Speaker 6:  No, no, no. Although what are three band?

351
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:24,515
Speaker 2:  You just want the smart glasses.

352
00:23:24,915 --> 00:23:25,555
Speaker 6:  I just want the glasses.

353
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:28,635
Speaker 2:  Even if we get the whole team, we're immediately killing the Quest line and

354
00:23:28,635 --> 00:23:30,035
Speaker 2:  we're just going Smart glasses. That's

355
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:32,595
Speaker 6:  What they just did. I just want That's what Meta just did. Yeah. Smart Fish

356
00:23:32,835 --> 00:23:36,675
Speaker 6:  reorganize that team. So I am saying the glasses are the

357
00:23:36,675 --> 00:23:40,355
Speaker 6:  future. Okay. And we're, we're putting, we're putting our excess iPhone profits

358
00:23:40,355 --> 00:23:40,795
Speaker 6:  into the glasses.

359
00:23:41,715 --> 00:23:45,035
Speaker 5:  Interesting. Oh, I mean, if the glasses like ran a really good

360
00:23:46,065 --> 00:23:48,565
Speaker 5:  ai, well no, we don't have one of those. We have Siri.

361
00:23:48,805 --> 00:23:52,245
Speaker 6:  Although on a six year time horizon, it's like, hmm, hmm. Maybe I just wanna

362
00:23:52,245 --> 00:23:53,685
Speaker 6:  take Samsung's watches and do login.

363
00:23:56,005 --> 00:23:58,525
Speaker 2:  I mean, that is, that is actually an interesting question, right? Like, is,

364
00:23:58,585 --> 00:24:01,565
Speaker 2:  are we betting that smart glasses are going to be

365
00:24:02,205 --> 00:24:06,085
Speaker 2:  sufficiently huge by 2030? That this is like worth it for us? Or are we

366
00:24:06,085 --> 00:24:09,045
Speaker 2:  just taking like a nerd gadget for the next six years?

367
00:24:09,225 --> 00:24:12,365
Speaker 5:  No, this makes sense for us because we are, we're like, we're, we're cool.

368
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:15,165
Speaker 5:  We're luxury. What's this luxury? Like a pair of Ray bands

369
00:24:15,515 --> 00:24:17,405
Speaker 2:  Fair. Okay. I have two others I'd like to throw at you. An

370
00:24:17,405 --> 00:24:17,805
Speaker 5:  Aura ring.

371
00:24:18,435 --> 00:24:21,165
Speaker 2:  That is one of the things I was gonna throw at you. I think Aura is like

372
00:24:21,165 --> 00:24:24,045
Speaker 2:  a sneakily fascinating company. They're, and they are, they're way ahead

373
00:24:24,265 --> 00:24:28,245
Speaker 2:  in Smart Rings. Smart rings are a lot of people think including our own

374
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:32,165
Speaker 2:  v song about to be a real thing. I think especially if you're betting that

375
00:24:32,165 --> 00:24:35,805
Speaker 2:  this like health and fitness thing is gonna keep growing really fast, that's

376
00:24:35,805 --> 00:24:39,605
Speaker 2:  a place to go. I also think Garmin for kind of the same reasons. Like what

377
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:43,365
Speaker 2:  if we can redesign Garmin's watches so that they don't look dumb,

378
00:24:43,705 --> 00:24:46,445
Speaker 2:  but they have all the cool stuff that Garmin already has that people really

379
00:24:46,445 --> 00:24:50,405
Speaker 2:  like. I feel like you could make something out of Garmin. I also, my

380
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:53,525
Speaker 2:  immediate reaction when we did this was Snap because I want the spectacles

381
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:56,965
Speaker 2:  line, but I think we go, we go RayBan Meta Smart Glasses and that gets us

382
00:24:56,965 --> 00:24:59,445
Speaker 2:  everywhere. We're going probably significantly faster.

383
00:24:59,715 --> 00:25:02,925
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's basically, do we wanna go watch Ring or Glasses?

384
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:03,925
Speaker 5:  Totally.

385
00:25:04,185 --> 00:25:04,405
Speaker 2:  But

386
00:25:04,405 --> 00:25:06,485
Speaker 5:  If we go Samsung, we do watch and ring. Right?

387
00:25:06,555 --> 00:25:09,845
Speaker 6:  Well, so the the thing that this I think makes very clear

388
00:25:10,505 --> 00:25:14,445
Speaker 6:  is You can take any of the watches and You can do iPhone lock in.

389
00:25:14,465 --> 00:25:18,165
Speaker 6:  And now you have a realistic competitor to the Apple Watch, right? Like

390
00:25:18,195 --> 00:25:21,845
Speaker 6:  Yeah. That's the thing that actually holds a bunch of these companies back

391
00:25:22,305 --> 00:25:24,925
Speaker 6:  is they cannot communicate with the iPhone. Right?

392
00:25:24,925 --> 00:25:28,605
Speaker 2:  Yeah. But that be cool Neli. It's written, it's written

393
00:25:28,745 --> 00:25:32,365
Speaker 2:  at the top of the building of our headquarters. It just says, be cool. What's

394
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:32,565
Speaker 2:  cooler

395
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:34,125
Speaker 5:  Than lock in? What's cooler

396
00:25:34,155 --> 00:25:34,685
Speaker 2:  Than lock?

397
00:25:34,755 --> 00:25:37,845
Speaker 6:  Yeah. The change I'm making is being like, all right, whoop, you're in like,

398
00:25:37,845 --> 00:25:41,725
Speaker 6:  let's go. You know? Yeah. Like You can, You can now more directly

399
00:25:41,725 --> 00:25:43,085
Speaker 6:  figure out Apple integrations.

400
00:25:43,425 --> 00:25:44,965
Speaker 2:  Buy a ThinkPad, get a whoop, let's go.

401
00:25:46,585 --> 00:25:49,645
Speaker 6:  But I'm just saying like, if that on a six year time horizon, maybe that

402
00:25:49,645 --> 00:25:53,325
Speaker 6:  is a better move than take the Meta

403
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:57,645
Speaker 6:  ray bands and figure out how glasses work. Which by the way, glasses

404
00:25:57,915 --> 00:26:01,525
Speaker 6:  also held back because they cannot properly integrate with your phone. Yeah.

405
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:04,365
Speaker 6:  This is like a, a real problem for all these products, but

406
00:26:04,365 --> 00:26:08,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that's why like the glasses, we get them properly integrating

407
00:26:08,325 --> 00:26:12,005
Speaker 5:  with the phone. Then we also have like an additional

408
00:26:12,015 --> 00:26:13,605
Speaker 5:  audio solution. When

409
00:26:13,685 --> 00:26:16,525
Speaker 6:  You say an additional audio solution, I mean, some headphones. Well,

410
00:26:16,525 --> 00:26:20,005
Speaker 5:  You know, we headphones is headphones coming up next. So you,

411
00:26:20,025 --> 00:26:22,925
Speaker 6:  You've been a CEO for 20 minutes. You are already super corporate.

412
00:26:22,925 --> 00:26:26,165
Speaker 5:  It's an additional Yeah. We need, we need more than one audio solution for

413
00:26:26,165 --> 00:26:26,845
Speaker 5:  our company guys,

414
00:26:27,075 --> 00:26:29,165
Speaker 2:  I've prepared a deck to talk about this. We even

415
00:26:29,165 --> 00:26:30,925
Speaker 5:  Need to be diversified in our audio.

416
00:26:32,155 --> 00:26:34,125
Speaker 6:  This is good. Good. It happens to everybody know,

417
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:37,885
Speaker 5:  It's, it be just immediate. Yeah. But the Garmin, like the Garmin has

418
00:26:37,905 --> 00:26:41,885
Speaker 5:  so much cool stuff in it. They just look so ugly and we've got the

419
00:26:41,885 --> 00:26:45,365
Speaker 5:  Apple team now. Right. They can like make it look good. We're that team,

420
00:26:45,365 --> 00:26:48,645
Speaker 5:  that poor team in Panos pane just chained to their desk.

421
00:26:48,785 --> 00:26:50,965
Speaker 2:  We need that team to keep making iPhones though. I don't know.

422
00:26:51,025 --> 00:26:53,365
Speaker 6:  But but they, it's not like they're doing a lot. They're like, take the buttons

423
00:26:53,365 --> 00:26:53,845
Speaker 6:  off it. You know?

424
00:26:56,545 --> 00:26:59,325
Speaker 2:  That's true. It's, it's thinner next time. Like we did

425
00:26:59,325 --> 00:27:02,565
Speaker 6:  It. I think you're the tiebreaker. I think it's between Garmin and Meta once

426
00:27:02,565 --> 00:27:06,045
Speaker 6:  again. David, you have to, you have to pull apart this corporate battle.

427
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:10,325
Speaker 2:  I think we should pick Meta. Ooh. Yeah. Because I think, I think the

428
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:13,805
Speaker 2:  RayBan Meta partnership is

429
00:27:14,315 --> 00:27:18,125
Speaker 2:  cool. I think the glasses are awesome and people really like them and I think

430
00:27:18,825 --> 00:27:22,565
Speaker 2:  our ability to like integrate them a little and make them way better

431
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:26,405
Speaker 2:  for people. Instant victory. Like I think with the other

432
00:27:26,455 --> 00:27:30,445
Speaker 2:  picks that we have here, we have a chance to like immediately make these

433
00:27:30,445 --> 00:27:33,245
Speaker 2:  things much cooler in a way that I feel like we're gonna have to basically

434
00:27:33,245 --> 00:27:36,525
Speaker 2:  like tear down the Garmin hardware team and build it back up. And I feel

435
00:27:36,525 --> 00:27:38,005
Speaker 2:  like that's gonna take us a while. Yeah.

436
00:27:38,005 --> 00:27:39,445
Speaker 5:  That's gonna be more than six years.

437
00:27:39,865 --> 00:27:43,445
Speaker 2:  Garmin, please know that I love you and you make cool things. Just like make

438
00:27:43,445 --> 00:27:44,085
Speaker 2:  them cooler.

439
00:27:44,345 --> 00:27:47,605
Speaker 6:  Garmin. If you'd like to integrate with Vergecast Incorporated's, iPhone

440
00:27:47,845 --> 00:27:48,965
Speaker 6:  You can pass 55%.

441
00:27:48,965 --> 00:27:50,565
Speaker 2:  Yeah. We'd love to have you. We've

442
00:27:50,565 --> 00:27:52,205
Speaker 5:  Got some really good audio solutions for you.

443
00:27:52,825 --> 00:27:55,925
Speaker 6:  The, the developer program is open and it will only be slightly more than

444
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:56,725
Speaker 6:  half of your revenue.

445
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:02,445
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Also, the smart glasses are just like cool. And I love using them and

446
00:28:02,685 --> 00:28:05,365
Speaker 2:  I want to have them. So we're, we're going with that. I feel good about it.

447
00:28:05,645 --> 00:28:09,525
Speaker 2:  I don't love that we just hired a hardware team out of Meta, which

448
00:28:09,525 --> 00:28:13,485
Speaker 2:  makes me feel a lot of feelings in general, but it's okay. We're we're doing

449
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:13,885
Speaker 2:  it. We

450
00:28:13,885 --> 00:28:15,285
Speaker 6:  Now know everything about you.

451
00:28:17,145 --> 00:28:20,965
Speaker 2:  Our privacy policy by the way, is dope. Like, let's just take that for granted

452
00:28:21,835 --> 00:28:22,325
Speaker 6:  Because

453
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,405
Speaker 2:  You're wondering about our privacy policy. It is sick.

454
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:26,245
Speaker 5:  The EU never gets mad at us.

455
00:28:26,465 --> 00:28:29,325
Speaker 2:  No. It's like not a problem at all. I should have said at the beginning,

456
00:28:29,325 --> 00:28:32,605
Speaker 2:  by the way, by picking the iPhone, we did just bring ourselves a delightful

457
00:28:32,605 --> 00:28:36,285
Speaker 2:  antitrust case that I'm not super psyched about, but I feel like it's

458
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:38,685
Speaker 2:  it's one of those is coming anyway, right? Yeah. Like you might as well,

459
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:39,165
Speaker 2:  Lena

460
00:28:39,395 --> 00:28:39,885
Speaker 5:  Call us.

461
00:28:40,355 --> 00:28:43,205
Speaker 2:  Neli has been begging to fight an antitrust case. So like it's

462
00:28:43,205 --> 00:28:46,645
Speaker 6:  Time from this side. That's really what I've been after this whole time is

463
00:28:46,865 --> 00:28:47,965
Speaker 6:  let me be the monopolist.

464
00:28:48,355 --> 00:28:49,005
Speaker 2:  It's, it's perfect.

465
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,885
Speaker 6:  I'm just saying we're raising rent. If we're going down, we're going down

466
00:28:51,885 --> 00:28:52,165
Speaker 6:  Rich.

467
00:28:53,395 --> 00:28:56,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And by the time any of this comes out, it'll be past 2030. We'll be

468
00:28:56,285 --> 00:28:58,885
Speaker 2:  out anyway. It's, it's fine. Yeah. I'm not worried about it. Alright, next

469
00:28:59,205 --> 00:29:03,125
Speaker 2:  category is headphones. And here again, we're pretty wide

470
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:06,405
Speaker 2:  open. Apple is off the board, but I'm gonna allow Beats to stay on the board

471
00:29:06,405 --> 00:29:09,765
Speaker 2:  because it is different enough that I think will allow it because

472
00:29:09,765 --> 00:29:10,845
Speaker 6:  They don't care about it.

473
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,565
Speaker 2:  Yeah, pretty much. Like, I don't know if Apple knows that it owns Beats,

474
00:29:13,565 --> 00:29:17,045
Speaker 2:  so we're just gonna let it ride. But there's also obvious players here. Bose

475
00:29:17,045 --> 00:29:19,405
Speaker 2:  and Sony and Sonos is a new one.

476
00:29:19,595 --> 00:29:21,125
Speaker 5:  Just headphones though. We'll,

477
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:23,805
Speaker 2:  No, we'll make this headphones slash speakers. We'll go audio solutions.

478
00:29:24,065 --> 00:29:26,165
Speaker 2:  Oh my gosh. In, in Alex Grand. I

479
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:27,965
Speaker 5:  Think you know exactly where we're going with this.

480
00:29:28,555 --> 00:29:30,325
Speaker 2:  Neli is gonna advocate for the party speaker.

481
00:29:30,475 --> 00:29:33,485
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I'm taking Sony now that it's audio solutions.

482
00:29:34,075 --> 00:29:37,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah, we've got a lot Ara. Wider range.

483
00:29:37,435 --> 00:29:40,805
Speaker 6:  It's the ult. I mean, you want luxury. What

484
00:29:41,035 --> 00:29:43,125
Speaker 6:  screams luxury more than the words? Mega base.

485
00:29:43,525 --> 00:29:44,965
Speaker 2:  A seven foot tall speaker

486
00:29:45,345 --> 00:29:47,885
Speaker 6:  By the way. Shout out to the Vergecast listeners who just send me pictures

487
00:29:47,885 --> 00:29:51,645
Speaker 6:  of it in the wild. Amazing. It's like they're birding, you know,

488
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,805
Speaker 6:  but like the only one person cares about birds and it's me.

489
00:29:55,705 --> 00:29:59,405
Speaker 2:  How does it feel to be known for the cyber truck wiper and Sony party speakers?

490
00:29:59,435 --> 00:30:01,165
Speaker 2:  Like, is this a good legacy that you're happy

491
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:05,085
Speaker 6:  About? Is that on the list? Cyber truck wiper on the wild card gadgets. Cyber

492
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:05,885
Speaker 6:  truck wiper.

493
00:30:06,145 --> 00:30:10,005
Speaker 2:  We have two wild card options, so don't, don't worry. I, for me

494
00:30:10,005 --> 00:30:13,485
Speaker 2:  it's Sonos on this one. Interesting. I want Sonos real bad because again,

495
00:30:13,485 --> 00:30:17,045
Speaker 2:  we're in this like, we want to build cool stuff that's integrated. Sonos

496
00:30:17,045 --> 00:30:19,605
Speaker 2:  makes good products. They know how to make good audio products. I feel like

497
00:30:19,605 --> 00:30:23,285
Speaker 2:  we could take Sonos and be like, just learn how to make software. Everything's

498
00:30:23,285 --> 00:30:23,645
Speaker 2:  gonna be fine.

499
00:30:24,195 --> 00:30:25,965
Speaker 6:  Just learn this easy part. Yeah. Like,

500
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:28,645
Speaker 2:  Have you heard of apps? What if we did that? This could be

501
00:30:28,645 --> 00:30:32,405
Speaker 6:  Fine. So again, I I I would actually take Sony here, not just because of

502
00:30:32,405 --> 00:30:35,365
Speaker 6:  the party speaker situation. I think our headphones are really good. They're

503
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:39,085
Speaker 6:  my Sony noise cancels are really good, right? I think they compete with Bose

504
00:30:39,485 --> 00:30:43,205
Speaker 6:  to be the top of the market. Then they've got an actual audio solutions catalog,

505
00:30:43,955 --> 00:30:47,885
Speaker 6:  like an actual array of speakers and like, what is one product I want desperately

506
00:30:47,915 --> 00:30:51,365
Speaker 6:  from Sonos so they won't sell is like a receiver, right? Like fair. There's

507
00:30:51,365 --> 00:30:54,525
Speaker 6:  a huge array of those audio products that You can

508
00:30:54,735 --> 00:30:58,245
Speaker 6:  ruthlessly integrate with a phone in a way that even Sonos can't right now.

509
00:30:58,245 --> 00:31:00,885
Speaker 6:  That's why they have the software problems. Like their app platform has to

510
00:31:00,885 --> 00:31:04,405
Speaker 6:  support a bunch of stuff because they can't just put it on your phone directly.

511
00:31:04,785 --> 00:31:07,365
Speaker 6:  And also Mega Megabase. I would just get it. Okay. I would

512
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,525
Speaker 2:  Have it. Alex, what do you think? I just

513
00:31:09,525 --> 00:31:13,205
Speaker 5:  Really like the Sony headphones. Okay. They just have such a nice, wider,

514
00:31:13,735 --> 00:31:17,605
Speaker 5:  wider range. Like Sonos just got into headphones. They don't have any in-ear

515
00:31:17,605 --> 00:31:19,245
Speaker 5:  monitors. Sure. They don't have any buds.

516
00:31:19,555 --> 00:31:23,205
Speaker 2:  Also tough time to be taking over Sonos. Like real, real kind of reputation

517
00:31:23,265 --> 00:31:23,485
Speaker 2:  hit

518
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:26,925
Speaker 6:  Oh, you know what you don't have on here. What's that? And again, I'm, I'm

519
00:31:26,925 --> 00:31:30,805
Speaker 6:  just gonna point this out for everyone. I think the age of televisions is

520
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:34,485
Speaker 6:  coming to an end because David made a list of gadgets and didn't put TVs

521
00:31:34,485 --> 00:31:34,685
Speaker 6:  on them.

522
00:31:34,835 --> 00:31:37,845
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I don't care. I, no part of me wants to build televisions.

523
00:31:38,115 --> 00:31:40,845
Speaker 6:  Well, I'll just remind everyone that I asked the CEO EO of Netflix about

524
00:31:40,845 --> 00:31:44,165
Speaker 6:  the Samsung frame tv and he was like, why are you stop talking to me. Yeah.

525
00:31:45,085 --> 00:31:47,325
Speaker 6:  I was like, do you think this is a harbinger of doom? And he was like, I

526
00:31:47,325 --> 00:31:48,565
Speaker 6:  don't know what you're saying. I have,

527
00:31:48,805 --> 00:31:49,045
Speaker 2:  I own

528
00:31:49,045 --> 00:31:52,325
Speaker 6:  One, but I'm just saying you made an entire list of gadgets and you didn't

529
00:31:52,325 --> 00:31:55,365
Speaker 6:  put TVs on here. It's a, it's a prophecy because

530
00:31:55,365 --> 00:31:58,085
Speaker 5:  He knew you were gonna say the Sam we're gonna acquire the Samsung frame

531
00:31:58,085 --> 00:31:58,605
Speaker 5:  and fix it.

532
00:31:58,665 --> 00:32:01,885
Speaker 2:  To be clear. Not an oversight. We are not getting in the television business.

533
00:32:02,205 --> 00:32:05,485
Speaker 2:  What if we made no money and everything was impossible and we had to spy

534
00:32:05,485 --> 00:32:05,925
Speaker 2:  on our users.

535
00:32:06,305 --> 00:32:10,165
Speaker 6:  All I'm saying is if TVs were on here anywhere, then I would

536
00:32:10,165 --> 00:32:13,645
Speaker 6:  change my headphones pick to see if you're giving me audio solutions, but

537
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:17,525
Speaker 6:  not TVs, then it's Sony. Okay. If you're, if TVs

538
00:32:17,525 --> 00:32:21,165
Speaker 6:  are back on the list, then I, I have to, I'm required by

539
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:24,685
Speaker 6:  like blood and heritage to take Sony televisions. Okay. And then I would

540
00:32:24,685 --> 00:32:25,925
Speaker 6:  change my headphones pick. So

541
00:32:25,925 --> 00:32:29,845
Speaker 2:  We do have a wild card round coming later. And, if you, if you think You

542
00:32:29,845 --> 00:32:33,285
Speaker 2:  can win the fight for us to get Sony TVs, You can, You can hold your fire

543
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:33,645
Speaker 2:  for them.

544
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:35,805
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna fight for TCL so hard.

545
00:32:35,805 --> 00:32:39,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I don't think you're gonna win the Sony TVs fight. I just don't think,

546
00:32:39,085 --> 00:32:40,205
Speaker 2:  think we wanna be in the TV business.

547
00:32:40,315 --> 00:32:43,285
Speaker 6:  Well, if I take him off the board here, it's a big, it's a big decision.

548
00:32:43,285 --> 00:32:46,805
Speaker 6:  Yes. How do I get Ma West in the tablet is kind of the, you know, I gotta

549
00:32:46,805 --> 00:32:47,725
Speaker 6:  play three moves ahead.

550
00:32:48,085 --> 00:32:51,445
Speaker 2:  I will be down with Sony here, by the way. Tough beat for Bose that none

551
00:32:51,445 --> 00:32:53,405
Speaker 2:  of us are even attempting to take Bose. They're

552
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:54,045
Speaker 5:  Fine. Well, well

553
00:32:54,045 --> 00:32:57,565
Speaker 6:  You made it audio solutions, right? If it was just headphones,

554
00:32:58,405 --> 00:33:01,005
Speaker 6:  I would immediately go Bose so I could win the Sony fight later.

555
00:33:01,485 --> 00:33:05,205
Speaker 2:  Interesting. Okay. Yeah. And I don't, it's just like a bunch of weird scientists

556
00:33:05,205 --> 00:33:09,125
Speaker 2:  in Massachusetts. Like, we don't, we don't need that. I'll go Sony under

557
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:12,125
Speaker 2:  one stipulation, which is that we immediately rename every single product

558
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:13,605
Speaker 2:  they make to something. Yes. Not stupid.

559
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:17,165
Speaker 6:  No. With more letters. Twice as many letters

560
00:33:17,825 --> 00:33:19,725
Speaker 2:  And another dash in the middle for no

561
00:33:19,725 --> 00:33:19,925
Speaker 6:  Reason.

562
00:33:22,195 --> 00:33:23,165
Speaker 6:  Just get in there.

563
00:33:23,675 --> 00:33:27,525
Speaker 2:  Okay. I think it's Sony. Okay. Yeah. I, I feel good about this. I think we're,

564
00:33:27,525 --> 00:33:28,165
Speaker 2:  I think we're aligned.

565
00:33:28,445 --> 00:33:29,805
Speaker 6:  I can figure something out for TVs. Yeah.

566
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:33,405
Speaker 2:  I feel now obligated to take something from Samsung just so that you can't

567
00:33:33,405 --> 00:33:35,605
Speaker 2:  argue for the Frame tv because I don't need this in my life.

568
00:33:36,105 --> 00:33:39,805
Speaker 6:  That's not what I was gonna take again. I believe it's a harbinger of doom.

569
00:33:41,195 --> 00:33:44,725
Speaker 2:  Okay. So the next two things on here are, I would say

570
00:33:45,145 --> 00:33:48,685
Speaker 2:  the sneaky places. We're gonna make a lot of money. This is what pays for

571
00:33:48,685 --> 00:33:52,165
Speaker 2:  everything else that the shareholders are gonna love and we're probably never

572
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:56,045
Speaker 2:  gonna talk about again. The first one is app platforms, which I suppose

573
00:33:56,045 --> 00:33:59,765
Speaker 2:  could be a single app if we wanted a single app. But I'm thinking more along

574
00:33:59,765 --> 00:34:03,445
Speaker 2:  the lines of like big groups of things. So like, I had Adobe Creative Cloud

575
00:34:03,465 --> 00:34:07,365
Speaker 2:  as an option here and Microsoft Office and Google Workspace. This is like

576
00:34:07,725 --> 00:34:11,165
Speaker 2:  probably B2B software that is going to make us just a tremendous amount of

577
00:34:11,165 --> 00:34:12,085
Speaker 2:  money. What do we think?

578
00:34:12,545 --> 00:34:16,325
Speaker 6:  So I have to go with office. Okay. Only for one

579
00:34:16,335 --> 00:34:19,045
Speaker 6:  small reason, and I can't believe you didn't think of it first, David. We

580
00:34:19,045 --> 00:34:20,925
Speaker 6:  cannot run this company without Microsoft Excel.

581
00:34:20,985 --> 00:34:21,885
Speaker 2:  Oh, that's interesting.

582
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:25,725
Speaker 6:  No company can be run without Microsoft Excel. Like just for our own survival.

583
00:34:25,725 --> 00:34:26,285
Speaker 6:  Yeah. You know,

584
00:34:26,285 --> 00:34:29,805
Speaker 5:  You can just like pay for a license. We'll have so much money

585
00:34:30,225 --> 00:34:32,525
Speaker 5:  we can just pay for a license for Excel.

586
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:34,565
Speaker 2:  But what if other people paid us for licenses?

587
00:34:34,835 --> 00:34:37,925
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I'm just saying you want, you want a, you want a dog food, you know,

588
00:34:37,925 --> 00:34:39,045
Speaker 6:  your your own your own work.

589
00:34:39,155 --> 00:34:42,405
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But we can have Adobe Creative Cloud and just have a

590
00:34:42,445 --> 00:34:44,405
Speaker 5:  stranglehold on the entire industry.

591
00:34:45,185 --> 00:34:46,565
Speaker 6:  You want people to hate us.

592
00:34:47,105 --> 00:34:50,925
Speaker 5:  We can just like, I love a monopoly. I'm, I'm on this side of

593
00:34:50,925 --> 00:34:51,485
Speaker 5:  things now,

594
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:55,205
Speaker 2:  Another antitrust fight that I'm really excited about. Yeah. We're

595
00:34:55,205 --> 00:34:58,285
Speaker 5:  Only gonna be there six years By the time that stuff all hits, we'll be long

596
00:34:58,315 --> 00:34:58,605
Speaker 5:  gone.

597
00:34:58,825 --> 00:35:02,525
Speaker 2:  So I think the upside of Creative Cloud is we take Creative Cloud,

598
00:35:02,945 --> 00:35:06,405
Speaker 2:  we make the pricing better and we're legends. Right? Like instantly. Yeah.

599
00:35:06,555 --> 00:35:10,325
Speaker 2:  Best possible PR win is we just like give away

600
00:35:10,595 --> 00:35:12,605
Speaker 2:  Premier. We're just like here You can have it.

601
00:35:12,745 --> 00:35:15,925
Speaker 5:  No, we, we sell like, rather than the cloud license, we're like, okay, You

602
00:35:15,925 --> 00:35:19,285
Speaker 5:  can just buy Premier, but it'll cost a thousand dollars. Yeah.

603
00:35:19,525 --> 00:35:19,765
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

604
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:22,925
Speaker 5:  Then we make a lot of money and people are happy because they can just own

605
00:35:22,925 --> 00:35:23,445
Speaker 5:  it for

606
00:35:23,445 --> 00:35:24,125
Speaker 2:  Six years. Yeah. For

607
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:27,925
Speaker 5:  Six years. And then it's gone and then, and then, you know, whoever

608
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:31,245
Speaker 5:  follows us. Panos, I'm sorry you're taking over the company from us.

609
00:35:31,795 --> 00:35:32,285
Speaker 5:  Good luck.

610
00:35:32,725 --> 00:35:35,645
Speaker 6:  A lot of our ideas are like, what if we made slightly less money? But that's

611
00:35:35,645 --> 00:35:39,045
Speaker 6:  fine. Whereas my ideas are what if we made a lot more money?

612
00:35:39,755 --> 00:35:43,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah. This, this says a lot about the, the distinct vibes of The Vergecast

613
00:35:43,365 --> 00:35:47,325
Speaker 2:  Incorporated team. I would say it's either office or it's Creative

614
00:35:47,325 --> 00:35:49,965
Speaker 2:  Cloud. Right? I feel like there's nothing else you, like, we could go try

615
00:35:49,965 --> 00:35:53,685
Speaker 2:  to get like Oracle's weird business or like IBM's consulting arm or

616
00:35:53,925 --> 00:35:57,125
Speaker 2:  whatever, but we haven't picked a Google thing. Mm. Do we not want Google

617
00:35:57,125 --> 00:36:00,525
Speaker 2:  Workspace? Do we just take Google Workspace and go kill office?

618
00:36:00,865 --> 00:36:04,645
Speaker 6:  So my, my idea here again, you know, the, our our company's mission

619
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:08,645
Speaker 6:  is try hard. Yeah. And workspace is a ripe target for trying hard. Yeah.

620
00:36:08,675 --> 00:36:11,445
Speaker 6:  This is also where you could do messaging. You could, you know, you could

621
00:36:11,445 --> 00:36:14,405
Speaker 6:  walk in the room, be like, make a list of all the messaging products and

622
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:16,725
Speaker 6:  then walk out and six months later you come back in and look at the list

623
00:36:16,725 --> 00:36:20,125
Speaker 6:  and you like circle one and you're like this one we're just doing this one.

624
00:36:20,405 --> 00:36:23,805
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And we're gonna name it Gchat. That's a real, that's a thing you could

625
00:36:23,805 --> 00:36:24,005
Speaker 6:  do here.

626
00:36:24,105 --> 00:36:27,085
Speaker 2:  It is. It is. Messaging I would point out is a separate category. So we're,

627
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:29,725
Speaker 2:  we're gonna get to messaging, but if we, whatever company we pick here, we

628
00:36:29,725 --> 00:36:33,685
Speaker 2:  can't pick there. Okay. Which is a case for and against some folks

629
00:36:33,685 --> 00:36:34,365
Speaker 2:  here. And

630
00:36:34,365 --> 00:36:38,125
Speaker 5:  If we pick Microsoft Office, we can't pick Azure. If we

631
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:41,405
Speaker 5:  pick Google Workspace, we can't pick Google Cloud. That's

632
00:36:41,405 --> 00:36:45,245
Speaker 6:  Right. No one was picking Google Cloud. Come on. I, okay, I'll, I'll I will

633
00:36:45,365 --> 00:36:48,405
Speaker 6:  nce and say we should pick Creative Cloud. And our mission here is to make

634
00:36:48,405 --> 00:36:50,205
Speaker 6:  people not not hate us. Yeah.

635
00:36:50,285 --> 00:36:54,245
Speaker 2:  I think, I think this is where we win over all the people to use

636
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:57,845
Speaker 2:  our hardware because they're gonna love, this is how we sell Lenovo ThinkPads

637
00:36:57,845 --> 00:37:01,685
Speaker 6:  Because of 55% lock-in Yeah. You can run Creative Cloud

638
00:37:02,105 --> 00:37:05,405
Speaker 6:  on someone else's laptop. It'll just cost four times as much money.

639
00:37:06,485 --> 00:37:09,165
Speaker 6:  I I don't make the rules. Yeah. Except for that one.

640
00:37:09,515 --> 00:37:12,765
Speaker 5:  Well just like, like the more your company makes, we charge you more like

641
00:37:12,765 --> 00:37:14,325
Speaker 5:  just a, a scale, a sliding scale.

642
00:37:14,425 --> 00:37:17,645
Speaker 2:  Oh, I like that. You pay per YouTube subscriber instead of per

643
00:37:19,105 --> 00:37:19,605
Speaker 6:  So evil.

644
00:37:20,915 --> 00:37:23,965
Speaker 5:  Exactly. Oh, you're just getting out in this industry. You basically get

645
00:37:23,965 --> 00:37:24,685
Speaker 5:  it for free. Right?

646
00:37:24,685 --> 00:37:24,925
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

647
00:37:25,325 --> 00:37:26,165
Speaker 2:  I love this. The minute

648
00:37:26,165 --> 00:37:28,965
Speaker 5:  You start making success that we, we come for our

649
00:37:28,965 --> 00:37:32,885
Speaker 6:  Cut and if you're wearing our wearable, we can track your general

650
00:37:32,885 --> 00:37:35,805
Speaker 6:  burnout level as a creator and we start bringing the price back down. Yeah.

651
00:37:36,005 --> 00:37:38,085
Speaker 5:  I love that. See, oh my god. Synergy.

652
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:42,165
Speaker 2:  We actually turn the app off when you need a rest day and then, and then

653
00:37:42,165 --> 00:37:42,485
Speaker 2:  we'll get it

654
00:37:42,485 --> 00:37:43,445
Speaker 6:  Back. Calm down Jimmy.

655
00:37:46,745 --> 00:37:49,205
Speaker 2:  All right. So we're, we're good on Creative cloud. Alright.

656
00:37:49,805 --> 00:37:50,645
Speaker 6:  I mean Sure.

657
00:37:50,885 --> 00:37:51,765
Speaker 2:  I think it's the right answer.

658
00:37:51,785 --> 00:37:54,645
Speaker 6:  That's okay. I, I know I'm the one who has to deal with like whatever terms

659
00:37:54,645 --> 00:37:58,165
Speaker 6:  of service conflagration. It's like I'm fine. I'll I'll do it. Yeah.

660
00:37:58,165 --> 00:38:01,005
Speaker 5:  David and I work four days a year. Oh

661
00:38:01,005 --> 00:38:04,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Kran and I are the ones who like go to canned lions and like meet with

662
00:38:04,525 --> 00:38:07,205
Speaker 2:  advertisers. You have to actually like do the things. I

663
00:38:07,205 --> 00:38:09,765
Speaker 6:  Have to write the blog post. It's like, all right, we changed our terms of

664
00:38:09,765 --> 00:38:13,445
Speaker 6:  service. Exactly. It's true that we're gonna take your firstborn child,

665
00:38:13,865 --> 00:38:16,325
Speaker 6:  but we're doing this for the good of all humanity.

666
00:38:16,915 --> 00:38:20,685
Speaker 2:  This is beautiful. I love this for you. Alright, next category is the

667
00:38:20,685 --> 00:38:24,485
Speaker 2:  boring B2B on a faucets. This is where we get to, we get to

668
00:38:24,485 --> 00:38:28,245
Speaker 2:  pick our cloud provider. We can make B2B chips

669
00:38:28,275 --> 00:38:31,725
Speaker 2:  that we sell. I was gonna put arm in here, but we can't have arm because

670
00:38:31,745 --> 00:38:35,325
Speaker 2:  arm only thing is arm. So that doesn't really work. We can, this is, this

671
00:38:35,325 --> 00:38:39,045
Speaker 2:  is where we make all of our money, but we try to never talk about in public

672
00:38:39,045 --> 00:38:40,005
Speaker 2:  because no one cares.

673
00:38:40,305 --> 00:38:41,525
Speaker 6:  Can we take TSMC?

674
00:38:41,755 --> 00:38:43,525
Speaker 2:  What would you want to take from TSMC

675
00:38:43,745 --> 00:38:45,005
Speaker 6:  Making the chips for everybody?

676
00:38:45,265 --> 00:38:46,205
Speaker 2:  No, that's their whole thing.

677
00:38:47,385 --> 00:38:50,925
Speaker 6:  But they don't make a product called TSMC. No, we don't ship T

678
00:38:51,275 --> 00:38:52,005
Speaker 6:  SMCs around the world.

679
00:38:52,005 --> 00:38:54,245
Speaker 2:  Right. That would be then just buying the company, which is not what we're

680
00:38:54,245 --> 00:38:55,125
Speaker 2:  doing. We're taking products.

681
00:38:55,265 --> 00:38:57,325
Speaker 5:  You get like one TSMC factory.

682
00:38:57,675 --> 00:39:00,845
Speaker 2:  This is like an expansion draft in sports. Right. We get to like pick from

683
00:39:00,845 --> 00:39:02,205
Speaker 2:  your roster, but we can't have your team.

684
00:39:02,315 --> 00:39:05,645
Speaker 6:  What about that one company in Europe that actually makes the lithography

685
00:39:05,645 --> 00:39:07,725
Speaker 6:  machine? Ooh, that TSMC relies on

686
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:09,805
Speaker 2:  That like $23 million machine.

687
00:39:10,355 --> 00:39:14,285
Speaker 6:  Yeah. There's only, what's the name of that company? A SML. I think we should

688
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,765
Speaker 6:  take a s ml. I think we should take the machine that makes the fabs.

689
00:39:16,785 --> 00:39:18,365
Speaker 2:  The machine. That makes the fabs. Okay.

690
00:39:18,825 --> 00:39:20,685
Speaker 5:  Not like Azure. Yeah.

691
00:39:20,685 --> 00:39:24,245
Speaker 6:  But like, you know, I'm already defending Creative Cloud. Like, I'm not trying

692
00:39:24,245 --> 00:39:24,845
Speaker 6:  to be outta

693
00:39:24,845 --> 00:39:28,365
Speaker 5:  Here. I just wanna print all the money. Like this. This is, this is our money

694
00:39:28,365 --> 00:39:31,085
Speaker 5:  printer. Who, who gets mad at Azure? Right? Lately

695
00:39:32,545 --> 00:39:35,405
Speaker 6:  No one. But it's also in second place. Right? You have to, you have to go

696
00:39:35,405 --> 00:39:39,285
Speaker 6:  make the AI case, you gotta do the AI CRM thing to

697
00:39:39,285 --> 00:39:42,365
Speaker 6:  make, to grow Azure. Right. I guess we're just milking it for profits and

698
00:39:42,365 --> 00:39:43,045
Speaker 6:  walking away. Right?

699
00:39:43,055 --> 00:39:44,565
Speaker 5:  Right. Yeah. We're only here for six years

700
00:39:44,745 --> 00:39:47,045
Speaker 6:  And we are, we can't take AWS 'cause we took the Kindle. Right.

701
00:39:47,315 --> 00:39:51,165
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Which is a very funny trade to have made. If, if

702
00:39:51,165 --> 00:39:52,485
Speaker 2:  you're trying to build a business,

703
00:39:52,885 --> 00:39:56,685
Speaker 5:  I mean, Ooh, we could take whisper from OpenAI

704
00:39:56,795 --> 00:39:58,885
Speaker 2:  Whisper's open source. We're good there. Oh

705
00:39:58,885 --> 00:40:02,765
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Good. Also OpenAI, it's on this list as a money faucet, but it is not,

706
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:05,205
Speaker 6:  it's like a reverse, it's a drain. Oh, I

707
00:40:05,315 --> 00:40:08,765
Speaker 2:  True. I meant to write this as basically like if we want, we can take

708
00:40:09,235 --> 00:40:12,565
Speaker 2:  like GPT-4 oh from OpenAI, which,

709
00:40:12,565 --> 00:40:16,365
Speaker 6:  Which still, which they are now in a one, a stunning business.

710
00:40:16,995 --> 00:40:19,165
Speaker 6:  Judo move or giving away for free to Apple.

711
00:40:19,275 --> 00:40:22,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah. No, I, I'm not, I don't think that's the winner, but I just, I wanted

712
00:40:22,205 --> 00:40:23,565
Speaker 2:  to have an AI I option here.

713
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,845
Speaker 5:  Let's take Nvidia GForce now. Yeah.

714
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:30,485
Speaker 2:  So this is the thing. How do we get something from Nvidia? This is, this

715
00:40:30,485 --> 00:40:33,885
Speaker 2:  is my question. What do we take from Nvidia? Is it just the H 100 business?

716
00:40:34,025 --> 00:40:37,645
Speaker 2:  Do we just, we just take NVIDIA's whole AI

717
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:39,005
Speaker 2:  chip situation.

718
00:40:39,345 --> 00:40:42,925
Speaker 6:  I'm telling you. Do you, do you buy a SML and then you're like, if you

719
00:40:43,145 --> 00:40:47,125
Speaker 6:  use these machines to make H one hundreds, 55%.

720
00:40:48,585 --> 00:40:48,805
Speaker 2:  Huh?

721
00:40:50,275 --> 00:40:54,085
Speaker 5:  That is a pretty good funny faucet. I feel like we'll be ripe for

722
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:55,085
Speaker 5:  disruption there.

723
00:40:55,515 --> 00:40:59,365
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I think taking the, the Nvidia AI chip

724
00:40:59,645 --> 00:41:03,405
Speaker 6:  business is like a strong move. 'cause now you're selling to Google Cloud

725
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:06,645
Speaker 6:  and Azure. Yeah. And on a six year horizon, they all wanna disrupt you, but

726
00:41:06,645 --> 00:41:07,085
Speaker 6:  they won't be able

727
00:41:07,085 --> 00:41:10,405
Speaker 2:  To. That's what I was about to say. Do we worry that every other chip maker

728
00:41:10,425 --> 00:41:13,805
Speaker 2:  on earth is going to start making these and this becomes a bad bet pretty

729
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:14,045
Speaker 2:  soon?

730
00:41:14,185 --> 00:41:16,085
Speaker 5:  That's Panos problem in six years.

731
00:41:16,435 --> 00:41:19,725
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Not in six years, baby. Okay. In six years I'm on a boat. Yeah.

732
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:23,885
Speaker 2:  I mean the other, the other problem here is that if we, if we take that

733
00:41:24,185 --> 00:41:28,005
Speaker 2:  the bubble bursts and we become the poster child of the AI bubble

734
00:41:28,005 --> 00:41:31,045
Speaker 2:  that just burst and that's gonna happen in less than six years.

735
00:41:31,145 --> 00:41:33,885
Speaker 6:  That's true. This is why I'm saying we should take, take a s ml, the chip

736
00:41:33,885 --> 00:41:34,125
Speaker 6:  company

737
00:41:34,795 --> 00:41:38,765
Speaker 2:  That is like the least sexy business you could possibly imagine in that

738
00:41:39,165 --> 00:41:41,765
Speaker 2:  I doubt there's as much money in it because I don't think they can make all

739
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:43,245
Speaker 2:  that many of those. They really

740
00:41:43,245 --> 00:41:46,685
Speaker 5:  Cannot. It's like Samsung in their battery business. Actually, maybe this

741
00:41:46,685 --> 00:41:49,965
Speaker 5:  is a good idea. We're Samsung just makes a bunch of random stuff that makes

742
00:41:50,085 --> 00:41:51,245
Speaker 5:  'em a ton of money. Oh

743
00:41:51,245 --> 00:41:53,125
Speaker 6:  Yeah. We could take LG display right here.

744
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:55,085
Speaker 2:  Right? Oh, that's good. Ooh.

745
00:41:55,615 --> 00:41:59,285
Speaker 6:  Right. Like you want, you wanna put an in your phone, come talk to Lucky

746
00:41:59,285 --> 00:42:00,605
Speaker 6:  Gold Star. You know. Wait, I

747
00:42:00,605 --> 00:42:01,005
Speaker 2:  Like that a

748
00:42:01,005 --> 00:42:04,485
Speaker 5:  Lot. I was like, LG display that, that feels like it the way we all were

749
00:42:04,485 --> 00:42:05,125
Speaker 5:  just like, yeah.

750
00:42:05,505 --> 00:42:09,165
Speaker 2:  See, and it, that feels, that feels sticky. They're gonna make screens for

751
00:42:09,165 --> 00:42:12,245
Speaker 2:  a long time. I feel like we're in and that's like, that's easy. It runs itself.

752
00:42:12,245 --> 00:42:13,725
Speaker 2:  We're good. All right. I love this. And,

753
00:42:13,945 --> 00:42:16,725
Speaker 6:  And we love talking about it. We do. You know. Yeah. You, you want to talk

754
00:42:16,725 --> 00:42:18,565
Speaker 6:  about dual layer OLEDs? Let's go.

755
00:42:18,825 --> 00:42:21,925
Speaker 2:  Do you feel like this gets you close enough to the TV business that you're

756
00:42:21,925 --> 00:42:22,605
Speaker 2:  happy now, Eli?

757
00:42:23,395 --> 00:42:24,925
Speaker 5:  They make the panels that go in your So

758
00:42:25,035 --> 00:42:26,085
Speaker 6:  It's true. They do make the panels.

759
00:42:26,385 --> 00:42:27,645
Speaker 2:  That's, we're like, we're, we're

760
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:30,885
Speaker 6:  Fine. I got my, I got myself a monitor in TV business. Yeah. We're gonna

761
00:42:30,885 --> 00:42:34,365
Speaker 6:  take l LG display and we're going to, we're we're gonna make TVs

762
00:42:34,505 --> 00:42:38,085
Speaker 5:  And then we're just gonna bolt two Sony party speakers to it. Boom.

763
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:40,205
Speaker 6:  You think we won? Sell these tomorrow. Come on.

764
00:42:41,275 --> 00:42:43,645
Speaker 5:  Come on. Some little pulsing lights at the bottom. Yeah.

765
00:42:43,915 --> 00:42:46,965
Speaker 2:  Okay. All right. Nailed it. That's good. LG display. This is great. I'm in.

766
00:42:47,445 --> 00:42:49,725
Speaker 2:  Alright, we're gonna take one more break and then we're gonna come back.

767
00:42:49,785 --> 00:42:53,005
Speaker 2:  We got four more to do. We're gonna build VERGE casting. We'll be right back.

768
00:45:06,375 --> 00:45:10,155
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Next up for the triumvirate

769
00:45:10,335 --> 00:45:14,195
Speaker 2:  at Vergecast Incorporated is messaging. We can,

770
00:45:14,215 --> 00:45:18,035
Speaker 2:  we can take, again, not a company, so we can't take signal from Signal

771
00:45:18,135 --> 00:45:21,715
Speaker 2:  or Telegram From Telegram, but we can, we can take and reinvent any

772
00:45:21,715 --> 00:45:25,635
Speaker 2:  messaging app or platform or ecosystem that we want. We can't take

773
00:45:25,635 --> 00:45:29,195
Speaker 2:  from Meta, which I just realized because we took the RayBan Smart Glasses,

774
00:45:29,445 --> 00:45:33,235
Speaker 2:  which I now slightly regret because I would like to have taken WhatsApp so

775
00:45:33,235 --> 00:45:37,075
Speaker 5:  We can take all of the different Google chats that have existed and finally

776
00:45:37,105 --> 00:45:37,715
Speaker 5:  make one.

777
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,675
Speaker 6:  Yeah. This is our opportunity. Yeah.

778
00:45:39,735 --> 00:45:40,715
Speaker 2:  We can make Gchat

779
00:45:41,345 --> 00:45:45,235
Speaker 6:  Done. Done. I, I can solve, I canfin

780
00:45:45,355 --> 00:45:46,155
Speaker 6:  I can solve this.

781
00:45:46,955 --> 00:45:50,395
Speaker 2:  I mean, again, on the list of like do it and be legends. Finally making

782
00:45:50,685 --> 00:45:51,915
Speaker 2:  Gchat is is way up there.

783
00:45:51,985 --> 00:45:55,955
Speaker 6:  Just making Gchat and then I, you know, I got the phone. So, or

784
00:45:55,955 --> 00:45:58,155
Speaker 6:  your blue bubble problems are solved. Yeah.

785
00:45:58,335 --> 00:46:00,515
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah. We don't have to worry about Messenger. We

786
00:46:00,515 --> 00:46:02,075
Speaker 2:  Just put blue bubbles on the iPhone. Yeah,

787
00:46:02,145 --> 00:46:05,955
Speaker 6:  It's super done. Whoa. This isn't even, why are we in Gchat, baby? I

788
00:46:05,955 --> 00:46:08,515
Speaker 6:  met my wife on that. That's a real story, by the way. That's not just a case

789
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:08,715
Speaker 6:  in your

790
00:46:08,715 --> 00:46:09,875
Speaker 2:  Picture. That is a real thing. Yeah.

791
00:46:09,925 --> 00:46:13,755
Speaker 6:  Becky and I spent years of our, our early relationship in Gchat and nowhere

792
00:46:13,755 --> 00:46:13,955
Speaker 6:  else.

793
00:46:14,415 --> 00:46:18,395
Speaker 2:  Do you ever randomly find like the transcripts of those chats when you're

794
00:46:18,395 --> 00:46:20,955
Speaker 2:  searching for something in your Gmail? This is a thing that happens to me

795
00:46:21,155 --> 00:46:24,475
Speaker 2:  occasionally. I'll search for like, pizza in my Gmail and it'll be like,

796
00:46:24,695 --> 00:46:28,395
Speaker 2:  did you mean this conversation you had with your ex 11 years ago that we

797
00:46:28,395 --> 00:46:28,995
Speaker 2:  saved in Gmail?

798
00:46:29,695 --> 00:46:32,395
Speaker 6:  Ooh, I haven't thought about that. And now I'm worried about looking.

799
00:46:33,045 --> 00:46:33,795
Speaker 5:  Don't look. Don't

800
00:46:33,795 --> 00:46:35,035
Speaker 6:  Look. So we're, we're gonna set that aside.

801
00:46:35,565 --> 00:46:35,995
Speaker 5:  Don't look.

802
00:46:36,185 --> 00:46:37,755
Speaker 2:  It's good. It's probably for the best. All

803
00:46:37,755 --> 00:46:41,515
Speaker 6:  Of those Gchat conversations were before we were dating. So they were just

804
00:46:41,515 --> 00:46:45,195
Speaker 6:  conversations about the things we had gotten up to at night,

805
00:46:45,365 --> 00:46:46,515
Speaker 6:  which is a lot of things.

806
00:46:46,835 --> 00:46:49,915
Speaker 2:  I. love it. Yeah. That's very good. Yeah. All right. The only other one I

807
00:46:49,915 --> 00:46:53,235
Speaker 2:  would throw in is Slack, which I think is like a forever

808
00:46:53,525 --> 00:46:55,235
Speaker 2:  unrealized potential that

809
00:46:55,455 --> 00:46:56,115
Speaker 5:  Or Discord.

810
00:46:56,295 --> 00:46:59,995
Speaker 2:  So, but we can't take Discord. 'cause Discord is Discord, right? Like, oh,

811
00:46:59,995 --> 00:47:01,675
Speaker 2:  that's right. That's, that's It's off the, just I

812
00:47:01,675 --> 00:47:02,995
Speaker 5:  Thought somebody else on Discord now.

813
00:47:03,095 --> 00:47:06,675
Speaker 2:  No, they almost sold, but it's still just Discord. Microsoft was gonna, but

814
00:47:06,675 --> 00:47:10,275
Speaker 2:  then they were like, this seems like a disaster. Which probably reasonable

815
00:47:10,275 --> 00:47:10,515
Speaker 2:  call

816
00:47:11,165 --> 00:47:15,155
Speaker 5:  Gchat being good, like, we're gonna kind of win people

817
00:47:15,155 --> 00:47:19,075
Speaker 5:  over with, with Adobe, but eventually we will jack

818
00:47:19,075 --> 00:47:22,035
Speaker 5:  up the prices on them and have it like, without question. Yeah. Yeah. Just

819
00:47:22,035 --> 00:47:24,995
Speaker 5:  having Gchat there as like instant win. Okay. Okay.

820
00:47:25,295 --> 00:47:28,635
Speaker 2:  Oh, yeah. All right. I feel good about this. It's Gchat and we're, we're

821
00:47:28,635 --> 00:47:31,325
Speaker 2:  agreed that we're scrapping all the other nonsense. And we're calling it

822
00:47:31,455 --> 00:47:31,965
Speaker 2:  Gchat, right?

823
00:47:31,965 --> 00:47:33,445
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Without, okay. Easily

824
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:37,165
Speaker 2:  We are building the Gchat that always should have existed. Next one is streaming

825
00:47:37,165 --> 00:47:40,565
Speaker 2:  service, which is actually fun because again, we can't steal a company. So

826
00:47:40,565 --> 00:47:42,485
Speaker 2:  like, Netflix is out. Oh,

827
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:44,405
Speaker 6:  Shit. We just traded Gchat for YouTube,

828
00:47:45,795 --> 00:47:47,085
Speaker 2:  Dude. Oh, no,

829
00:47:47,465 --> 00:47:49,845
Speaker 6:  No, no. Can we go back? We should take Slack.

830
00:47:49,845 --> 00:47:50,485
Speaker 5:  No, we can take TikTok.

831
00:47:50,825 --> 00:47:52,245
Speaker 6:  Oh, we can take TikTok. Yeah,

832
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:53,245
Speaker 2:  You're right. We can take TikTok

833
00:47:53,465 --> 00:47:54,765
Speaker 6:  For now. It's on by, by chance.

834
00:47:55,545 --> 00:47:55,765
Speaker 2:  So.

835
00:47:55,945 --> 00:47:59,165
Speaker 6:  Oh, we can buy. We are it We are gonna save America. Yeah, we,

836
00:47:59,165 --> 00:48:02,085
Speaker 5:  We buy it. Oh yeah. There we, oh my God.

837
00:48:02,305 --> 00:48:05,285
Speaker 6:  My dude. The wild card round here is amazing. We're gonna, we're gonna be

838
00:48:05,305 --> 00:48:08,405
Speaker 6:  heroes with Gchat and we're gonna save America's youth. Oh,

839
00:48:08,505 --> 00:48:12,485
Speaker 2:  Wow. We just did it. This is, this is, we did it. We're now the coolest company

840
00:48:12,505 --> 00:48:16,245
Speaker 2:  on earth. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And the good news is this one isn't even gonna

841
00:48:16,245 --> 00:48:19,485
Speaker 2:  be very expensive because they're desperately trying to get rid of it. Yeah.

842
00:48:19,505 --> 00:48:20,405
Speaker 5:  Eat your heart out Oracle.

843
00:48:20,665 --> 00:48:23,925
Speaker 6:  We do have to fight the Chinese government and Larry Ellison, it'll be fine.

844
00:48:24,065 --> 00:48:27,405
Speaker 6:  Do you think at the end to buy TikTok you have to win a boat race against

845
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:31,165
Speaker 6:  Larry Ellison? He's like, I'll do this. If You can beat me in the

846
00:48:31,165 --> 00:48:31,565
Speaker 6:  America's

847
00:48:31,565 --> 00:48:32,685
Speaker 2:  Cup, let's yacht about it.

848
00:48:33,235 --> 00:48:33,525
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

849
00:48:35,235 --> 00:48:39,165
Speaker 2:  Okay. So I will just say there's a bunch of Disney streaming services that

850
00:48:39,165 --> 00:48:43,085
Speaker 2:  are interesting. ESPN would make us an awful lot of money for a pretty long

851
00:48:43,085 --> 00:48:46,845
Speaker 2:  time. Hulu exists, Disney Plus exists.

852
00:48:47,265 --> 00:48:49,925
Speaker 2:  We could have Apple TV Plus and have all the good shows. Yeah.

853
00:48:49,925 --> 00:48:53,805
Speaker 5:  But those are also dependent on external licenses that we might not

854
00:48:53,835 --> 00:48:54,325
Speaker 5:  acquire.

855
00:48:55,035 --> 00:48:55,325
Speaker 2:  True.

856
00:48:55,715 --> 00:48:58,485
Speaker 5:  With our streaming service acquisition. Right. We're not getting the star

857
00:48:58,485 --> 00:49:00,125
Speaker 5:  rights to Star Wars. We

858
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:03,365
Speaker 2:  Get, we get all the existing contracts. Yeah. But I think you're right. If

859
00:49:03,365 --> 00:49:06,245
Speaker 2:  we get Disney plus we get, we don't get to own Star Wars. You're right.

860
00:49:06,585 --> 00:49:10,525
Speaker 6:  The economics of streaming are very simple. There's a handful of companies

861
00:49:11,105 --> 00:49:15,085
Speaker 6:  who think the Samsung Frame TV will continue to exist. Their business model

862
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:18,805
Speaker 6:  is they pay a lot of money for content and then try to pay, make people

863
00:49:18,865 --> 00:49:22,405
Speaker 6:  pay money for it. The other model is TikTok

864
00:49:22,915 --> 00:49:26,805
Speaker 6:  gets free content from America's teenagers and then sells ads against it.

865
00:49:27,305 --> 00:49:31,285
Speaker 6:  And not for nothing. An infinite array of pirated movies from the idiots

866
00:49:31,285 --> 00:49:34,365
Speaker 6:  who are paying for content. Yeah. It's, it's gotta be TikTok you just for

867
00:49:34,365 --> 00:49:37,485
Speaker 6:  the, the economics of the business. Like, do you want to have costs or not

868
00:49:37,495 --> 00:49:37,845
Speaker 6:  costs.

869
00:49:38,065 --> 00:49:40,765
Speaker 2:  But again, TikTok not famously making a ton of money right now.

870
00:49:40,875 --> 00:49:43,765
Speaker 6:  Well, 'cause they're, they're, you know, we're, we'll fix that 55%.

871
00:49:44,145 --> 00:49:48,085
Speaker 5:  No, no. It's, it's, we, we do something like deal with Adobe Creative Cloud

872
00:49:48,335 --> 00:49:50,085
Speaker 5:  where we somehow charge our own creators.

873
00:49:50,235 --> 00:49:53,085
Speaker 2:  Well, we're gonna have to, because if we get TikTok, we don't get cap cut.

874
00:49:53,105 --> 00:49:56,325
Speaker 2:  So we're gonna have to immediately put the Creative Cloud team on building

875
00:49:56,545 --> 00:49:58,165
Speaker 2:  cap cut. Yeah. So that people would,

876
00:49:58,265 --> 00:50:00,805
Speaker 6:  But the TikTok video editor is cap cut. So we just spin it out.

877
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:02,285
Speaker 2:  It's good enough. Yeah. Like it'll work

878
00:50:02,285 --> 00:50:03,005
Speaker 6:  And we call it cut cap.

879
00:50:03,005 --> 00:50:06,645
Speaker 2:  You can probably cut Cap. There we go. All right. TikTok and cut Cap. We've

880
00:50:06,645 --> 00:50:09,565
Speaker 2:  done it. All right. I, I think that's right. I feel good about it. I like

881
00:50:09,565 --> 00:50:12,845
Speaker 2:  briefly wanted to fight for Prime video just because it is like, it's another

882
00:50:12,845 --> 00:50:16,805
Speaker 2:  one that is like, try harder. Oh no. We took Kindle.

883
00:50:17,185 --> 00:50:20,165
Speaker 2:  God. Yeah, we took Kindle. Yeah. The amount of money that cost that taking

884
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:22,005
Speaker 2:  Kindle has cost us. Good Lord.

885
00:50:22,565 --> 00:50:25,245
Speaker 6:  I mean, it is very funny that we took Kindle and Google Check.

886
00:50:26,665 --> 00:50:28,845
Speaker 5:  That's what we took from those companies. I

887
00:50:28,845 --> 00:50:32,485
Speaker 2:  Will say if, if we want to go back and take Slack and YouTube, we have a

888
00:50:32,485 --> 00:50:32,685
Speaker 2:  chance.

889
00:50:33,385 --> 00:50:34,805
Speaker 5:  No, we're committed.

890
00:50:35,105 --> 00:50:38,365
Speaker 2:  Is there anything cooler than fixing Gchat? Like, that might be the single

891
00:50:38,365 --> 00:50:41,205
Speaker 2:  most important thing we do at this company. I feel really good about it.

892
00:50:41,485 --> 00:50:41,605
Speaker 2:  I

893
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:43,205
Speaker 5:  Mean, the teens will prefer us for TikTok.

894
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:47,005
Speaker 2:  That's true. Okay. So we have, we have two more categories, one of which

895
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:50,445
Speaker 2:  I just changed two minutes ago and I'm very excited about it. So far. We

896
00:50:50,445 --> 00:50:54,325
Speaker 2:  have the iPhone business from Apple. We have the Kindle

897
00:50:54,485 --> 00:50:58,365
Speaker 2:  business from Amazon, the PC business from Lenovo. We're doing

898
00:50:58,505 --> 00:51:01,045
Speaker 2:  all of Meta's wearables. We haven't decided yet if we're killing the Quest,

899
00:51:01,145 --> 00:51:04,125
Speaker 2:  but we're probably killing the quest. We're all in on the smart glasses.

900
00:51:04,775 --> 00:51:08,525
Speaker 2:  We're taking Sony's audio solutions. We're taking Adobe Creative

901
00:51:08,535 --> 00:51:12,365
Speaker 2:  Cloud. We're taking LG Display and we're taking Yeah.

902
00:51:12,815 --> 00:51:16,005
Speaker 2:  Gchat. Well, we're taking the mess of Google's messaging systems, which I

903
00:51:16,005 --> 00:51:18,485
Speaker 2:  think actually probably means we hire most of Google because everybody's

904
00:51:18,485 --> 00:51:21,525
Speaker 2:  working on messaging in one way or another. And we're, we're, we're making

905
00:51:21,935 --> 00:51:25,485
Speaker 2:  Gchat and then we are saving America and taking over TikTok.

906
00:51:25,825 --> 00:51:27,285
Speaker 2:  How do we feel so far? Feel good? Just

907
00:51:27,285 --> 00:51:28,365
Speaker 6:  How many rules? I'm feeling great.

908
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:32,445
Speaker 2:  I really feel like it does. Lenovo is still very much the like, weird

909
00:51:32,825 --> 00:51:35,685
Speaker 2:  one out, but we're gonna make Lenovo cool again. It's gonna be great. Yeah.

910
00:51:35,685 --> 00:51:36,205
Speaker 5:  We'll fix it.

911
00:51:36,235 --> 00:51:39,645
Speaker 2:  Okay. So we have, we have two left. Which one is wild card

912
00:51:39,795 --> 00:51:43,765
Speaker 2:  gadgets, which is, I think the rules still apply. So we can't

913
00:51:43,765 --> 00:51:46,605
Speaker 2:  take from a company we've already taken from, but we can take from any category,

914
00:51:46,605 --> 00:51:49,765
Speaker 2:  including categories we have not talked about. So it's some other product

915
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:54,165
Speaker 2:  that Vergecast Inc is going to make that is not off limits because we've

916
00:51:54,165 --> 00:51:58,085
Speaker 2:  already taken from another company. We can, we can do TVs. This is where

917
00:51:58,085 --> 00:52:01,725
Speaker 2:  we take the cyber truck. If we wanna take the cyber truck. Anything you guys

918
00:52:01,725 --> 00:52:04,045
Speaker 2:  want? Any initial thoughts? Anything you're excited about?

919
00:52:04,235 --> 00:52:06,965
Speaker 6:  Well, so this is where I was kinda back into taking LGS TVs.

920
00:52:06,965 --> 00:52:07,725
Speaker 2:  Okay. Too

921
00:52:07,725 --> 00:52:09,405
Speaker 6:  Late. But then we already have LG display.

922
00:52:09,725 --> 00:52:12,245
Speaker 2:  I think this is better. We have the part of the business that's like good

923
00:52:12,345 --> 00:52:15,245
Speaker 2:  and not the part of the business that is Web os. I feel really good about

924
00:52:15,685 --> 00:52:17,445
Speaker 2:  LG Display and not lgp.

925
00:52:17,755 --> 00:52:20,485
Speaker 5:  Have you guys heard of a company called Stores and Bickle?

926
00:52:20,665 --> 00:52:22,765
Speaker 2:  Is this how we get into like, I bespoke whiskey?

927
00:52:23,305 --> 00:52:26,285
Speaker 5:  No, this is how we get in. We just get the volcano. They make a whole bunch

928
00:52:26,285 --> 00:52:29,765
Speaker 5:  of different vapes. We just get the volcano business. Okay. And then we,

929
00:52:29,765 --> 00:52:33,405
Speaker 5:  like, we make one that looks really, really cool. We put

930
00:52:33,765 --> 00:52:37,725
Speaker 5:  a big screen on it, put some big speakers on the side. Just a whole

931
00:52:37,805 --> 00:52:39,085
Speaker 5:  one-stop party business.

932
00:52:39,325 --> 00:52:40,725
Speaker 2:  It's just for Alex Krantz.

933
00:52:40,785 --> 00:52:44,085
Speaker 5:  It was just, you know, legalization is coming for this country. True. We

934
00:52:44,085 --> 00:52:45,965
Speaker 5:  gotta, we gotta be there at the st at the start.

935
00:52:46,305 --> 00:52:49,685
Speaker 2:  I'm not feeling that. I gotta tell you. No, I just feel like by, if, if we

936
00:52:49,685 --> 00:52:51,285
Speaker 2:  were in this till 2040, yeah,

937
00:52:51,285 --> 00:52:51,885
Speaker 5:  That makes sense.

938
00:52:52,105 --> 00:52:55,365
Speaker 2:  I'd be down 20, 30. Feels iffy. And that's just like a lot of

939
00:52:55,955 --> 00:52:57,405
Speaker 2:  legislation stuff. All right.

940
00:52:57,425 --> 00:53:00,885
Speaker 6:  I'm, I'm just, I'm throwing this out there. The Nvidia Shield, we,

941
00:53:00,885 --> 00:53:02,005
Speaker 5:  We, oh yeah. We didn't, didn't do

942
00:53:02,005 --> 00:53:02,205
Speaker 2:  Nvidia

943
00:53:02,205 --> 00:53:05,485
Speaker 6:  Did, we didn't do we we didn't take, we took LG display over NVIDIA's GP

944
00:53:05,845 --> 00:53:06,005
Speaker 6:  business.

945
00:53:06,775 --> 00:53:07,725
Speaker 2:  We're doing really well.

946
00:53:07,955 --> 00:53:09,925
Speaker 5:  This gets us the Tegra. Yeah.

947
00:53:10,185 --> 00:53:11,125
Speaker 2:  Why this? Because

948
00:53:11,445 --> 00:53:15,365
Speaker 6:  I, I think between Crans and I, we can communicate with an audience of

949
00:53:15,365 --> 00:53:17,805
Speaker 6:  tv. We can, we can bring the shield back to problem.

950
00:53:17,915 --> 00:53:19,725
Speaker 2:  This is a try harder move. Look,

951
00:53:19,725 --> 00:53:23,045
Speaker 6:  If you look, if you look on the forms right now, people are like the shield,

952
00:53:23,045 --> 00:53:23,725
Speaker 6:  isn't it anymore?

953
00:53:23,915 --> 00:53:25,460
Speaker 2:  It's true. and it was for a long time.

954
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:28,210
Speaker 6:  There's a lot of people who are like, what you wanna do is run infuse on

955
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:30,565
Speaker 6:  Apple tv. And I think that's, that's a shame.

956
00:53:30,925 --> 00:53:32,525
Speaker 5:  Interesting. Yeah. We're not getting infused.

957
00:53:32,705 --> 00:53:35,325
Speaker 2:  Do we wanna get into the car business is my big question here.

958
00:53:35,705 --> 00:53:38,725
Speaker 6:  No. 'cause I, we, to be a successful car maker, you gotta, you gotta make

959
00:53:38,725 --> 00:53:41,885
Speaker 6:  a shoe, you gotta make a mid-size crossover. And I, that's just not for us.

960
00:53:41,995 --> 00:53:42,285
Speaker 6:  Okay.

961
00:53:42,665 --> 00:53:45,685
Speaker 2:  But again, we, we, we would take all the infrastructure required to do it.

962
00:53:45,685 --> 00:53:48,565
Speaker 2:  So we'd, we'd be up and running, making Kia Forte's tomorrow.

963
00:53:48,815 --> 00:53:50,445
Speaker 5:  We're not buying Kia. We're

964
00:53:50,445 --> 00:53:51,965
Speaker 2:  Not, we're we're just taking the Forte.

965
00:53:53,885 --> 00:53:57,365
Speaker 5:  I was like, I don't want any part of the Kia Hyundai business. They keep

966
00:53:57,365 --> 00:53:57,485
Speaker 5:  that

967
00:53:57,755 --> 00:54:01,405
Speaker 2:  Neli. You don't want the Mustang Mach. This is your moment. Take the Mach

968
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:01,845
Speaker 2:  e man.

969
00:54:02,115 --> 00:54:04,925
Speaker 6:  It's a shoe. I I'm just telling you, I'm just not, I'm not making a mid-size

970
00:54:04,925 --> 00:54:08,685
Speaker 6:  crossover. Alright. No, thank you. Like, if you're gonna let me be like

971
00:54:08,685 --> 00:54:12,165
Speaker 6:  crazy about it, you know, let's get nuts. But I don't,

972
00:54:12,995 --> 00:54:16,965
Speaker 6:  that business is too, too wackadoo. I, I, I talk to a lot of car CEOs.

973
00:54:16,965 --> 00:54:19,845
Speaker 6:  They're all same. Like, that's what will tear

974
00:54:19,845 --> 00:54:20,765
Speaker 2:  Us apart. Okay.

975
00:54:21,035 --> 00:54:24,925
Speaker 5:  Wait, I thought of it. Okay. Samsung's barely a

976
00:54:24,925 --> 00:54:26,725
Speaker 5:  live digital camera business.

977
00:54:26,945 --> 00:54:28,805
Speaker 2:  Oh, I like getting into the camera business.

978
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:32,645
Speaker 6:  Ooh. And then we can actually make them smartphones, right? Yeah. We actually

979
00:54:32,645 --> 00:54:35,565
Speaker 6:  take, you do the thing where you make the smartphone mirrorless camera. Exactly.

980
00:54:36,565 --> 00:54:36,725
Speaker 6:  Interesting.

981
00:54:36,795 --> 00:54:37,965
Speaker 5:  Does Samsung still make cameras?

982
00:54:38,465 --> 00:54:42,205
Speaker 2:  Do we want Samsung's though? Or do we want like Fuji's X 100

983
00:54:42,565 --> 00:54:42,685
Speaker 2:  business?

984
00:54:43,115 --> 00:54:45,645
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And then we, and then the solution is you just make them.

985
00:54:45,775 --> 00:54:49,725
Speaker 2:  Right? Make more of them. Let people buy them. Who would like them? Yeah.

986
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:53,045
Speaker 6:  I like that. I I like taking the camera. That's actually a great idea. Yeah.

987
00:54:53,065 --> 00:54:56,885
Speaker 5:  And then we fix the software so that it like, doesn't take you 12

988
00:54:56,885 --> 00:54:59,045
Speaker 5:  hours just to change the setting.

989
00:54:59,275 --> 00:55:03,045
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Sony cameras, but with menus that humans beings can

990
00:55:03,285 --> 00:55:07,125
Speaker 6:  navigate. Yeah. But I, I do think Fuji is like a good, in terms of wild card

991
00:55:07,185 --> 00:55:09,565
Speaker 6:  gadget for our brand especially. And

992
00:55:09,565 --> 00:55:12,405
Speaker 5:  Then we do like a limited release of the iPhone and the Fuji and they have

993
00:55:12,405 --> 00:55:15,805
Speaker 5:  like the same look to 'em. We'd sell a lot of money.

994
00:55:16,105 --> 00:55:18,485
Speaker 2:  That's pretty good. All right. That's good. So we're, we're taking, we're

995
00:55:18,485 --> 00:55:22,405
Speaker 2:  taking Fuji's X 100. All right. Yeah. Yeah. I like it. And

996
00:55:22,405 --> 00:55:26,085
Speaker 2:  then last category, the one I just added a minute ago, I had

997
00:55:26,085 --> 00:55:30,005
Speaker 2:  another non gadget wild card, but I think that's boring. So what we're gonna

998
00:55:30,005 --> 00:55:31,605
Speaker 2:  do instead is we're gonna buy a startup. Yeah.

999
00:55:31,845 --> 00:55:33,325
Speaker 6:  I, I know my answer right away. Really?

1000
00:55:33,515 --> 00:55:34,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I

1001
00:55:34,005 --> 00:55:35,285
Speaker 5:  Really hope it's the same one.

1002
00:55:35,285 --> 00:55:36,165
Speaker 6:  It's, it's rivian.

1003
00:55:36,385 --> 00:55:38,845
Speaker 2:  Oh, so you want to get into the car business

1004
00:55:39,385 --> 00:55:41,925
Speaker 6:  The whole time? Yeah. It was because they don't make a shoe.

1005
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:46,445
Speaker 2:  They also famously lose all the money in the world.

1006
00:55:46,875 --> 00:55:49,365
Speaker 6:  Sure. But 55% I can fix it. If you

1007
00:55:49,365 --> 00:55:53,285
Speaker 2:  Want a Rivian, you have to buy an iPhone. Rivian

1008
00:55:53,285 --> 00:55:55,365
Speaker 2:  are now in app purchases on iPhones.

1009
00:55:56,255 --> 00:55:57,285
Speaker 6:  55%.

1010
00:55:57,675 --> 00:56:01,605
Speaker 5:  What about like, we could get SSI we could have like just the AI guy.

1011
00:56:01,755 --> 00:56:02,045
Speaker 5:  It's

1012
00:56:02,045 --> 00:56:03,245
Speaker 6:  Just one guy. We're

1013
00:56:03,245 --> 00:56:03,405
Speaker 2:  You're,

1014
00:56:03,405 --> 00:56:04,565
Speaker 5:  We're already, I

1015
00:56:04,565 --> 00:56:07,645
Speaker 6:  Mean in that case, is OpenAI still a startup? 'cause that would be another

1016
00:56:07,765 --> 00:56:09,605
Speaker 2:  I was just about to say, I think open AI counts, but

1017
00:56:09,605 --> 00:56:12,445
Speaker 6:  You want something, you want like a startup, you want like an earthy.

1018
00:56:12,745 --> 00:56:16,645
Speaker 2:  So my vote, if we're buying an AI company, I wanna buy Anthropic. Yeah,

1019
00:56:17,315 --> 00:56:17,605
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1020
00:56:17,775 --> 00:56:21,645
Speaker 2:  Which is, I would say less valued but also way

1021
00:56:21,645 --> 00:56:23,005
Speaker 2:  less problematic. And they're

1022
00:56:23,165 --> 00:56:24,445
Speaker 5:  Actually making products, right?

1023
00:56:24,615 --> 00:56:27,805
Speaker 2:  Their product is, is moving along fast. They're like kind of right in the

1024
00:56:27,805 --> 00:56:31,725
Speaker 2:  mix with Google and Open ai. I don't know that I want to deal with the, like

1025
00:56:32,185 --> 00:56:34,365
Speaker 2:  Sam Altman of it all, if I'm being honest.

1026
00:56:35,105 --> 00:56:37,765
Speaker 6:  And a CEO is notoriously difficult here. Yeah,

1027
00:56:37,765 --> 00:56:41,645
Speaker 2:  Exactly. So if, if we're going ai and

1028
00:56:41,645 --> 00:56:45,045
Speaker 2:  that was one of my instincts, my vote would be anthropic. I also think like

1029
00:56:45,525 --> 00:56:48,645
Speaker 2:  a company like Notion would be an interesting one for us to buy potentially

1030
00:56:48,645 --> 00:56:49,525
Speaker 2:  a lot of money. There is

1031
00:56:49,525 --> 00:56:52,165
Speaker 6:  Notion, a startup. They've been around for a long time. This gets us into

1032
00:56:52,165 --> 00:56:54,285
Speaker 6:  like, what is a startup zone? Yeah.

1033
00:56:54,515 --> 00:56:57,205
Speaker 2:  Like, is Stripe still a startup? They're doing pretty well. I like

1034
00:56:57,205 --> 00:57:01,085
Speaker 5:  The idea of Anthropic though. Like that is firmly a startup.

1035
00:57:01,235 --> 00:57:03,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And Anthropic counts. I think like

1036
00:57:03,285 --> 00:57:06,405
Speaker 5:  Rivian has factories. Is that a startup when it has factories.

1037
00:57:06,875 --> 00:57:07,165
Speaker 6:  Fair.

1038
00:57:08,865 --> 00:57:12,525
Speaker 2:  It is just a fair point. Pretty much a car company. Yeah. But Neli, the problem

1039
00:57:12,525 --> 00:57:15,525
Speaker 2:  is if we buy Rivian, they're gonna, we have six years to convince you to

1040
00:57:15,525 --> 00:57:18,085
Speaker 2:  make a shoe. We will convince you to make a shoe.

1041
00:57:18,155 --> 00:57:22,125
Speaker 6:  Look, the R three X is very close to a shoe, but it's a, it's

1042
00:57:22,125 --> 00:57:24,405
Speaker 6:  a cool shoe. That's all I got for

1043
00:57:24,405 --> 00:57:27,445
Speaker 2:  You. So, okay. The, the other anthropic question is, do we wanna be in the

1044
00:57:27,585 --> 00:57:30,525
Speaker 2:  AI game? Like, are we, no, we don't need a move.

1045
00:57:30,945 --> 00:57:34,325
Speaker 5:  Not really. 'cause then we have to deal with copyright stuff. Neil's got

1046
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:38,245
Speaker 5:  a lot of blogs he's gonna have to write already, like apology blogs. I don't,

1047
00:57:38,385 --> 00:57:39,125
Speaker 5:  we don't need more.

1048
00:57:39,395 --> 00:57:43,085
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Neli is definitely the one testifying in Congress. Right. We're all,

1049
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:45,765
Speaker 2:  we're all on the same page about that. Yeah. I have, I have several other

1050
00:57:45,765 --> 00:57:48,445
Speaker 2:  options for You. can I throw some options at you? I love an option. We could

1051
00:57:48,445 --> 00:57:52,245
Speaker 2:  buy DJ I another company that might need some saving in America that

1052
00:57:52,245 --> 00:57:53,965
Speaker 2:  does some interesting stuff, but not a startup.

1053
00:57:54,225 --> 00:57:56,805
Speaker 6:  So you, you, this is now just companies we could buy. Mm.

1054
00:57:57,185 --> 00:57:58,205
Speaker 2:  Is it not a startup? It's

1055
00:57:58,205 --> 00:57:58,725
Speaker 6:  Super not a startup.

1056
00:57:58,955 --> 00:58:02,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah. You're probably right. Okay. Fine. That doesn't count. There's the

1057
00:58:02,005 --> 00:58:05,885
Speaker 2:  like Canva's and Figma of the world that also are kind of iffy on whether

1058
00:58:05,885 --> 00:58:09,645
Speaker 2:  they're startups. But like if we're in the creator world with Creative Cloud,

1059
00:58:09,645 --> 00:58:13,445
Speaker 2:  we fold that in the FTC won't allow it. Yeah. But these aren't the rules.

1060
00:58:13,815 --> 00:58:17,725
Speaker 6:  Canva is 10 years old and has a $26 billion value. Like, it's just like not

1061
00:58:17,805 --> 00:58:18,605
Speaker 6:  a startup. They

1062
00:58:20,155 --> 00:58:23,845
Speaker 6:  like, you wanna go? You do. You need some installer shit. Like what's some

1063
00:58:23,845 --> 00:58:25,285
Speaker 6:  like weird two person app?

1064
00:58:25,545 --> 00:58:26,765
Speaker 2:  Oh, interesting. Okay. Let's get

1065
00:58:26,765 --> 00:58:27,085
Speaker 5:  Carrot.

1066
00:58:27,395 --> 00:58:28,965
Speaker 2:  Does Discord count? No. Yep.

1067
00:58:29,225 --> 00:58:33,125
Speaker 6:  Not a startup. Like the, if Rivian isn't a startup, none of these other things

1068
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:34,125
Speaker 6:  are startups that you're mentioning.

1069
00:58:34,155 --> 00:58:37,925
Speaker 2:  Okay, fair enough. I think Anthropic is the best idea I have. Yeah.

1070
00:58:37,995 --> 00:58:38,845
Speaker 6:  Anthropic is

1071
00:58:38,845 --> 00:58:41,845
Speaker 2:  Good. I think I'm buying Anthropic. Yeah. It's like we're gonna like run

1072
00:58:41,845 --> 00:58:45,525
Speaker 2:  them off to the side though. They're, we're gonna sort of Instagram anthropic

1073
00:58:45,525 --> 00:58:48,285
Speaker 2:  where it's like you do your thing And. if you become really successful, we'll

1074
00:58:48,285 --> 00:58:51,805
Speaker 2:  ruin it for you eventually. Yeah. But until then, like you're kind of, this

1075
00:58:51,805 --> 00:58:55,565
Speaker 2:  is like your, your problem. And like if you get in trouble, that's your

1076
00:58:55,565 --> 00:58:59,285
Speaker 2:  problem and not ours. We're gonna call them like the moonshot factory

1077
00:58:59,385 --> 00:58:59,885
Speaker 2:  or whatever.

1078
00:59:00,035 --> 00:59:03,965
Speaker 5:  Well I think just having them collab on making Siri not suck would be like

1079
00:59:04,155 --> 00:59:05,045
Speaker 5:  huge. Yeah.

1080
00:59:05,145 --> 00:59:07,765
Speaker 2:  Oh yeah. 'cause we do need Siri to not suck. Yeah. That's pretty important.

1081
00:59:08,345 --> 00:59:09,405
Speaker 5:  Big, big change for us.

1082
00:59:10,035 --> 00:59:13,805
Speaker 2:  Okay. Alright. and it is welcome to the team Anthropic

1083
00:59:13,945 --> 00:59:14,365
Speaker 2:  people.

1084
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:18,405
Speaker 5:  How do you feel about party speakers? Anthropic? How can you make AI

1085
00:59:18,995 --> 00:59:19,685
Speaker 5:  accelerated,

1086
00:59:19,955 --> 00:59:22,445
Speaker 6:  Make these LEDs blink smarter than ever?

1087
00:59:22,845 --> 00:59:26,685
Speaker 2:  We have a lot of audio solutions that are ready for you. Okay. I

1088
00:59:26,685 --> 00:59:30,525
Speaker 2:  feel like we've done this. Can I, can I recap for you? Yes. Yes. At Vergecast

1089
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:34,405
Speaker 2:  Incorporated, here are the things that we make now we

1090
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:38,085
Speaker 2:  have the iPhone business. We have the Kindle business and all that that entails.

1091
00:59:38,665 --> 00:59:42,445
Speaker 2:  Lenovo PCs are now Vergecast PCs, Meta's whole

1092
00:59:42,915 --> 00:59:46,805
Speaker 2:  wearables thing. The Quest and the RayBan Smart Glasses.

1093
00:59:46,945 --> 00:59:50,765
Speaker 2:  That's us now. Sony's audio solutions, headphones, party speakers. The whole

1094
00:59:50,765 --> 00:59:54,605
Speaker 2:  jam. That's ours now. Yes. Adobe Creative Cloud is our big software

1095
00:59:54,785 --> 00:59:58,525
Speaker 2:  app platform Play. LG Display is now ours.

1096
00:59:58,785 --> 01:00:02,765
Speaker 2:  We are, we are. Just fing it up for everybody. If you want a TV hit

1097
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:06,285
Speaker 2:  up. The Vergecast. I love this. Yes. That feels right. We are taking over

1098
01:00:06,385 --> 01:00:09,925
Speaker 2:  all of Google's messaging shenanigans and turning 'em into Gchat, which might

1099
01:00:09,925 --> 01:00:11,805
Speaker 2:  be the single hardest thing we signed ourselves up for

1100
01:00:11,805 --> 01:00:14,445
Speaker 6:  Here. This is what kills us. I want to be clear. That's right. It's like

1101
01:00:14,445 --> 01:00:17,805
Speaker 6:  the guitarists in the singer start arguing a little bit and then Oasis breaks

1102
01:00:17,825 --> 01:00:20,205
Speaker 6:  up. That's messaging. Yeah.

1103
01:00:22,745 --> 01:00:26,365
Speaker 2:  Joe Biden just gave us TikTok. Yeah. Congrats to us. Big day. We

1104
01:00:26,705 --> 01:00:30,645
Speaker 2:  now have Fuji Film's X 100 business and Anthropic is

1105
01:00:30,645 --> 01:00:33,525
Speaker 2:  now part of The Vergecast Incorporated. How do we feel? This feels

1106
01:00:33,525 --> 01:00:36,885
Speaker 6:  Good. This feels great. This is the right combo of things.

1107
01:00:37,255 --> 01:00:41,245
Speaker 6:  We're doing a little bit of good. We're doing a little bit more evil. We're

1108
01:00:41,245 --> 01:00:43,205
Speaker 6:  making some money and then we're gonna fix messages.

1109
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:47,445
Speaker 2:  Yeah. We are incredibly deep into hardware. Like my only worry

1110
01:00:47,465 --> 01:00:50,125
Speaker 2:  is like, should we not have done LG display and pick something that is more

1111
01:00:50,125 --> 01:00:52,965
Speaker 2:  like cloud software? ai e No.

1112
01:00:52,965 --> 01:00:56,605
Speaker 5:  No, no. Because if we own the hardware, then they all have to do We done

1113
01:00:56,785 --> 01:01:00,285
Speaker 5:  ai, we got Anthropic. Yeah, we got anthropic in the iPhone. We,

1114
01:01:00,665 --> 01:01:01,525
Speaker 5:  we have all the power.

1115
01:01:01,665 --> 01:01:05,485
Speaker 2:  And Anthropic is like, their whole thing is they want to be like a B2B thing.

1116
01:01:05,585 --> 01:01:08,685
Speaker 2:  So that's, that could eventually pay dividends for us. And we have

1117
01:01:08,795 --> 01:01:12,165
Speaker 5:  Most of Google because we acquired all of Google messaging. Yeah.

1118
01:01:12,305 --> 01:01:16,285
Speaker 6:  And we're, we're just printing money on increasing creative cloud fees. Yeah.

1119
01:01:16,395 --> 01:01:17,205
Speaker 6:  Just to be clear,

1120
01:01:17,615 --> 01:01:21,245
Speaker 5:  Right. Microsoft is gonna be paying us so much money for their creative cloud.

1121
01:01:21,565 --> 01:01:25,325
Speaker 6:  I I think there's money to be had. And again, tiktoks business model is they,

1122
01:01:25,395 --> 01:01:26,525
Speaker 6:  they pirate content.

1123
01:01:26,755 --> 01:01:29,165
Speaker 2:  What are we gonna do with the TikTok shop? What's our first move with the

1124
01:01:29,165 --> 01:01:29,725
Speaker 2:  TikTok shop?

1125
01:01:29,905 --> 01:01:33,405
Speaker 6:  Oh, we are 55%. Yeah. Straight up.

1126
01:01:33,905 --> 01:01:36,285
Speaker 6:  You wanna transact in the TikTok shop? We're taking the fees.

1127
01:01:36,515 --> 01:01:40,205
Speaker 5:  Yeah. We just charge outrageous fees there. Except for our own products,

1128
01:01:40,585 --> 01:01:43,125
Speaker 5:  in which case we give them. We don't charge a fee at all.

1129
01:01:43,185 --> 01:01:46,285
Speaker 2:  Oh yeah. The self preferencing is going to be out of control. Yeah. On all

1130
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:50,125
Speaker 2:  of these. Like, do you want good Photoshop? You have to use RX

1131
01:01:50,125 --> 01:01:52,685
Speaker 2:  100 camera. Otherwise you get bad Photoshop. Really? Sorry.

1132
01:01:53,155 --> 01:01:55,885
Speaker 6:  This is actually great. It's like why do these companies act like this? And

1133
01:01:55,885 --> 01:01:58,885
Speaker 6:  it's like we're pretending we run the company and we're like, we are gonna

1134
01:01:58,885 --> 01:01:59,365
Speaker 6:  be so evil.

1135
01:01:59,505 --> 01:02:02,365
Speaker 2:  We started out trying to do a good job and now we're doing this. We're just

1136
01:02:02,365 --> 01:02:02,525
Speaker 2:  the most

1137
01:02:02,555 --> 01:02:06,525
Speaker 5:  Evil. Lena Khan just waiting behind us All right

1138
01:02:06,525 --> 01:02:06,725
Speaker 5:  now.

1139
01:02:07,075 --> 01:02:09,965
Speaker 2:  Yeah. All right. Well I think we've solved it. I feel like there's, we're,

1140
01:02:09,965 --> 01:02:12,285
Speaker 2:  we're easily a trillion dollar company right off the bat here.

1141
01:02:12,435 --> 01:02:13,125
Speaker 5:  Immediately.

1142
01:02:13,465 --> 01:02:16,125
Speaker 2:  Our website is gonna be sick, by the way. Yeah. That, that's very important

1143
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:19,445
Speaker 2:  to me. We're gonna give all our products cool names and our website is gonna

1144
01:02:19,445 --> 01:02:23,245
Speaker 2:  be so tight with like a good, understandable URL scheme.

1145
01:02:23,455 --> 01:02:26,765
Speaker 2:  These, these are the things I care about. I'm gonna run the

1146
01:03:06,525 --> 01:03:07,085
Speaker 6:  Megabase

1147
01:03:08,735 --> 01:03:10,125
Speaker 5:  Every time you type just a,

1148
01:03:35,655 --> 01:03:39,605
Speaker 2:  weird thing with me. And thank you as always for listening. As You can tell,

1149
01:03:40,065 --> 01:03:42,965
Speaker 2:  we have a lot of thoughts on all this, but I wanna hear yours too. We're

1150
01:03:42,965 --> 01:03:45,925
Speaker 2:  gonna put some links in the show notes to coverage we've done of these companies.

1151
01:03:46,185 --> 01:03:46,405
Speaker 2:  But
