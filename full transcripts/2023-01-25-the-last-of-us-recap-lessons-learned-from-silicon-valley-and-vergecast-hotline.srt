00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,080
Speaker 2:  Hello, and you're listening to The Verge, the flagship podcast

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,720
Speaker 2:  of Zombie Kisses. I'm your friend Alex Kranz, and we've got a big

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,200
Speaker 2:  show Today, obviously we're gonna be talking about the last of us with Charles

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,600
Speaker 2:  Pullum Moore. It's gonna be really, really exciting. And we're gonna be talking

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,760
Speaker 2:  about the zombie kisses. So if you haven't seen the latest episode of The

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,760
Speaker 2:  Last of Us, probably should go ahead and skip that part. Right now though,

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,800
Speaker 2:  I'm making cocktails. I'm making something called a Jet pilot, which involves

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,480
Speaker 2:  a lot of booze, a lot of juices, a little ice

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,840
Speaker 2:  in a blender. And it wouldn't exist if

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,240
Speaker 2:  non-competes had existed in the bartending world in the thirties because

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,000
Speaker 2:  it's based on something called the Zombie. The bartenders took the idea

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,960
Speaker 2:  for it, went to another hotel, made it. It's delicious. And it also makes

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,560
Speaker 2:  sense because I'm gonna be talking about non-competes on the show today.

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,680
Speaker 2:  I've got Margaret O'Mara coming on. She's a professor. She's written this

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,200
Speaker 2:  incredible book called The Code, all about the creation of Silicon Valley.

17
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,840
Speaker 2:  She makes a really smart case that the Silicone Valley we know today

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,720
Speaker 2:  might not be the same if non-competes had been

19
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,920
Speaker 2:  enforced in California in the fifties and sixties. It's gonna be really,

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,680
Speaker 2:  really fun. I'm super excited for you guys to hear it. We've also gonna be

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,080
Speaker 2:  doing the hotline today, so we've got a lot of your questions in and we're

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,200
Speaker 2:  gonna go ahead and answer them. It's gonna be a great time. But first I'm

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,600
Speaker 2:  gonna get back to Megan, this cocktail and a blender. See you on the other

46
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,080
Speaker 2:  Back. Okay, so as I already noted, we're talking the last of us with Charles

47
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,200
Speaker 2:  Pullum Moore today. So if you haven't watched and don't wanna be spoiled,

48
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,630
Speaker 2:  go ahead and skip this segment. No, really, I'm waiting.

49
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,390
Speaker 2:  Okay, great. Welcome everybody else. Look, the Last of us

50
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,830
Speaker 2:  is a bonafide hit and it's also one of the most successful adaptations of

51
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:01,240
Speaker 2:  a video game we've seen since like, like Angelina Jolie's, tomb Raider.

52
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,920
Speaker 2:  So Charles and I are gonna talk about the first two episodes, the state of

53
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,320
Speaker 2:  video game adaptations, and the hurdles still facing the last of us.

54
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,480
Speaker 2:  Hello Charles, how are you doing today?

55
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,520
Speaker 6:  I'm good crayons. How are you?

56
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,920
Speaker 2:  I'm good. I'm excited to talk with you about the last of us because we have

57
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,760
Speaker 2:  some different opinions and some similar opinions on this. And I think what

58
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,560
Speaker 2:  we first wanna probably talk about is this is kind of a big deal for

59
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,240
Speaker 2:  hbo, right? Like it's been super successful so

60
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,920
Speaker 6:  Far. Yeah. To listen to the way that HBO O is talking about this

61
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,320
Speaker 6:  show. It is the second coming more, more

62
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,960
Speaker 6:  specifically it is their second highest

63
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,320
Speaker 6:  rated show after House of the Dragon, sort of like since

64
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,120
Speaker 6:  2010, which is the, that's sort of like, that's sort of the starting point

65
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,080
Speaker 6:  that we're using as the beginning of like when streaming got serious and

66
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,120
Speaker 6:  it's like hbo, you existed before then and HBO's like, don't think about,

67
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,640
Speaker 6:  don't

68
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,840
Speaker 2:  Think about that. Don't think about it. Yeah, don't worry about it. But

69
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,720
Speaker 6:  It is, you know, it is sort of impressive that, aside from the

70
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,240
Speaker 6:  follow up to one of HBO's most successful shows, which you know has

71
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,800
Speaker 6:  eclipsed its predecessor in terms of its popularity rather in terms of its

72
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,600
Speaker 6:  premier's popularity. This new endeavor from the network has also

73
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,560
Speaker 6:  shown the early signs of being what the kids like to

74
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,360
Speaker 6:  call a hit. Yeah. You know, 4.7 million, you know,

75
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,800
Speaker 6:  4.7 million viewers for Premier is nothing to sneeze at.

76
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,000
Speaker 6:  And while HBO as an entity is

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,880
Speaker 6:  not new to this game, right, hbo, this is what

78
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,160
Speaker 6:  they do, they put out hits, right? Yeah. What is sort of, you know, special

79
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,760
Speaker 6:  and momentous about the last of us as you know, if you're listening to this,

80
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,760
Speaker 6:  you know, the last of us based on a video game, video games

81
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,000
Speaker 6:  have a reputation for not being, not lending themselves to the most

82
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,720
Speaker 6:  interesting or compelling adaptations.

83
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,040
Speaker 2:  I mean, I loved Super Mario Brothers the movie, was

84
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,360
Speaker 2:  it a good movie? No.

85
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,840
Speaker 6:  I mean like we, we are of an age, like we are of that age where we have gone

86
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,800
Speaker 6:  through enough waves of things both from like the

87
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,280
Speaker 6:  first party creators. Like we've just seen a number of different Marios Yeah.

88
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,760
Speaker 6:  That now at our big ages we can appreciate what the movie was trying to do.

89
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,440
Speaker 6:  Right. Whereas when you're, when you're young and impressionable, it's like,

90
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,960
Speaker 6:  it's not the thing that I thought it was gonna be. It's terrible. Yeah. Whereas

91
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,600
Speaker 6:  now it's sort of like in this era of her

92
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,520
Speaker 6:  medically sealed and calculated for success adaptations. You look at

93
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,840
Speaker 6:  something like that Mario movie and go, wow. Like the studios really would

94
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,640
Speaker 6:  not try to be like that bold. I was actually just

95
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,560
Speaker 6:  having a conversation about the last of us and the upcoming Mario movie and

96
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,520
Speaker 6:  it's like, yo, like looking back on that Mario, on the live action Mario

97
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,480
Speaker 6:  film, like the idea of a New York City encased in like wet

98
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,120
Speaker 6:  fungus that's colonized at everything is very much what the last of us is

99
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,760
Speaker 6:  trying to go for. Who's to say, who knows? Like maybe if Baba

100
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,720
Speaker 6:  Hoskins, our IP was popping up as Mario now we'd all be like, yo,

101
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,880
Speaker 6:  that right there, that's something I really wanna dig into.

102
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,720
Speaker 2:  I know, I, I, I feel like nobody understood how video game

103
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,240
Speaker 2:  adaptation should work then. And you look back on it and you're like, yeah,

104
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,960
Speaker 2:  it would've been stupid to do a live action like adaptation of the actual

105
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,240
Speaker 2:  Mario game. That would've been dumb.

106
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,520
Speaker 6:  It could have been dumb. It's one of those things where it's, it's, you know,

107
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,320
Speaker 6:  in order for video game adaptations to be successful, there is no one,

108
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,640
Speaker 6:  there is no one way to do it. Right? You can go for

109
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,440
Speaker 6:  accuracy and authenticity, quote unquote,

110
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,440
Speaker 2:  Which is what the last of us is doing, which

111
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,560
Speaker 6:  Is a lot of what the last of us is doing and that's what we're gonna talk

112
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,120
Speaker 6:  about. But there's also something to be said for taking risks and spending

113
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,880
Speaker 6:  money on the production to make it look good and interesting and really selling

114
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,720
Speaker 6:  people on the concept. I think that oftentimes when the shorthand

115
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,520
Speaker 6:  is sort of like, oh, this video game adaptation is bad, what people

116
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,120
Speaker 6:  are really speaking to is the different ways in which the

117
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,920
Speaker 6:  adaptations maybe didn't quite work hard enough

118
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,800
Speaker 6:  to get people on board with their idea of what the adaptation was going

119
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,080
Speaker 6:  to be. And it's kind of like, look, you know this thing and you recognize

120
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,720
Speaker 6:  that this thing is gonna be something different. How about you come on this

121
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,640
Speaker 6:  journey with us? And oftentimes when a film goes out

122
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,600
Speaker 6:  of its way to sort of make that jump from one medium to another easy for

123
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,520
Speaker 6:  you, you kind of find yourself having a good time. Like that's kind of, that

124
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,560
Speaker 6:  was, we're not even talking about the last twist yet, but like that was,

125
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,760
Speaker 6:  that's, that's often how I think about Detective Pikachu, which is a solid

126
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,600
Speaker 6:  film that people don't recognize as being like pretty close to a game. One

127
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,800
Speaker 6:  because a lot of people didn't play the game, but two, because the movie

128
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,560
Speaker 6:  really does go out of its way to sell you on,

129
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,280
Speaker 6:  Hey, what if there was a city filled with 12 species

130
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,080
Speaker 6:  of Pokemon no more, no less? You know?

131
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,840
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I I think like, I think we're, we can talk about the last of us when

132
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,600
Speaker 2:  we talk about this because Detective Pikachu told a really good

133
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,880
Speaker 2:  story first, right? Like, like the reason that people like that movie, the

134
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,640
Speaker 2:  reason people still like that movie is because it was out to tell a good

135
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,520
Speaker 2:  story. And if it hadn't been Pikachu, if it'd just been some other adorable

136
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,120
Speaker 2:  tiny, fluffy creature and a whole bunch of other adorable tiny fluffy creatures

137
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,560
Speaker 2:  probably wouldn't have done as well. Cuz you wouldn't have had that emotional

138
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,280
Speaker 2:  resonance, but it still would've like, worked as a film.

139
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,400
Speaker 6:  It would've worked. And I was gonna say, well, like would about Detective

140
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,240
Speaker 6:  Meow that wouldn't have worked. But then I was thinking to myself like, I

141
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,320
Speaker 6:  totally would've seen a live action team Rocket movie. But the, the thing

142
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,280
Speaker 6:  is like the, the magic of Detective Pikachu really

143
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,160
Speaker 6:  was sort of like, let's create a world that feels rooted

144
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,400
Speaker 6:  in the Pokemon world. Which is to say, you know, you've got my chances guiding

145
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,160
Speaker 6:  traffic, but we are going to make it read as realistic

146
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,280
Speaker 6:  enough for you adult Pokemon fans because we all know who these movies are

147
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,040
Speaker 6:  for. Right. To be able to and want to project yourself

148
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,000
Speaker 6:  into this space so that you can still get that, you know, little nostalgia

149
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,880
Speaker 6:  kick and be able to appreciate the story being told about how Me

150
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,720
Speaker 6:  Too is plotting to take over the world by swapping every,

151
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,120
Speaker 6:  it's very, it's, it's, it's, it's

152
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,800
Speaker 2:  It's a lot. It's a lot. Everybody go watch Detective Pikachu. It's a fun

153
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,520
Speaker 2:  movie. But I think that's interesting to talk about that when we talk

154
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,040
Speaker 2:  about the last of us, because the last of us didn't have as many

155
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,800
Speaker 2:  hurdles to, to jump over, right? Like Naughty Dog has historically done video

156
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,160
Speaker 2:  games that are, everybody calls 'em movies, everybody's like, oh, uncharted

157
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,560
Speaker 2:  is a movie. The Last of Us is a movie. So it kind of like, it already had

158
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,360
Speaker 2:  a lot of the big beats that you seal. It felt like easy mode as adaptations

159
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:04,640
Speaker 2:  go.

160
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,080
Speaker 6:  It is the truth. It's, it's one of those truths that when you say it out

161
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,360
Speaker 6:  loud, fans get upset with you. And it's like, well, you know, let's just

162
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,600
Speaker 6:  call it it. Like let's just call the thing what it is when you're playing

163
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,440
Speaker 6:  through the last of us. While it is this really dramatic story about

164
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,000
Speaker 6:  a man and his charge trying to survive through the apocalypse,

165
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,880
Speaker 6:  that feels rather specific and unique in the moment when you're

166
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,600
Speaker 6:  like ensconced in it. The moment that you take a step back from the last

167
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,520
Speaker 6:  of us and you know, you look to the left and the right and

168
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,200
Speaker 6:  see things like The Walking Dead, you know, in, in all of its fullness, you

169
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,840
Speaker 6:  recognize that it's just, it's, and I don't say this disparagingly, it's

170
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,440
Speaker 6:  another one of these stories, right? Yeah. This one is right down the middle

171
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,360
Speaker 6:  you've got a grizzled, middle-ish aged man who's got

172
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,160
Speaker 6:  regrets and a lot of you know, guilt and he's, he wears it on his

173
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,880
Speaker 6:  face and he carries it, he carries it in his gait and he's really just living

174
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,840
Speaker 6:  for this little girl who isn't his daughter, but she's just like his and

175
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,360
Speaker 6:  it's like, where have I heard this story before? And the answer is everywhere,

176
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,880
Speaker 6:  right? That it, yeah. It is one of those, you know, quote unquote

177
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,560
Speaker 6:  universal stories whose universality comes from the fact that it is told

178
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,080
Speaker 6:  over and over and over again.

179
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:14,120
Speaker 2:  I mean that's like Pedro Pascal's career the last couple of years

180
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,160
Speaker 2:  has been telling this story.

181
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:20,000
Speaker 6:  I don't know if anyone's seen the Mandalorian, but I mean to say that like

182
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,960
Speaker 6:  Ellie and Grok are essentially the same figure. It's not like

183
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,680
Speaker 6:  they got a lot in common. Right? I feel like, I feel like the two of them

184
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,720
Speaker 6:  would get along very, very well. But with the last of us as video game, what

185
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,080
Speaker 6:  really sort of set it apart and what really solidified it in a lot of fans

186
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,600
Speaker 6:  minds is being, you know, best video game story ever

187
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,200
Speaker 6:  has a lot to do with the fact that the game brought together a lot of

188
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,200
Speaker 6:  the components of, I don't wanna call 'em prestige, but you know,

189
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,880
Speaker 6:  serious and well-crafted apocalyptic stories. It brought all of those together

190
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,560
Speaker 6:  and packaged them into a video game that played a lot

191
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,320
Speaker 6:  like a cinematic story that gave you the ability, because it's

192
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,400
Speaker 6:  a third person game to just sort of shift around the scene as it was unfolding.

193
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,040
Speaker 6:  There are action elements, there are stealth elements, but you are supposed

194
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,640
Speaker 6:  to really develop a relationship. You are supposed to develop an

195
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,520
Speaker 6:  affinity for Ellie in all of her foul mouthiness and sort of the

196
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,320
Speaker 6:  way that she balks at the way that Joel is. And you're

197
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,360
Speaker 6:  supposed to sort of almost feel like the unseen third

198
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,560
Speaker 6:  companion who's like following along with them and

199
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,880
Speaker 6:  for people for whom this was their first exposure to that kind

200
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,440
Speaker 6:  of story, that kind of game. I, it's, it's not hard to understand why

201
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,040
Speaker 6:  this caught on for so many people, why this sort of became such a big, such

202
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,880
Speaker 6:  a big kick because, and again, this is not to disparage oftentimes, you know,

203
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,840
Speaker 6:  video game stories, they're not always great, right? Yeah. They're not always,

204
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,760
Speaker 6:  sometimes it is like, hey you are here to power these

205
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,400
Speaker 6:  guns up and mow through these masses of

206
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,200
Speaker 6:  undead people and that's it and that's it. Don't worry about the story. Yeah.

207
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,040
Speaker 6:  And the last of us really did sort of prioritize you internalizing the

208
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,200
Speaker 6:  story and your feelings about those characters. There were rumblings for

209
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,680
Speaker 6:  a very long time that there was going to be Last of Us film. It's also easy

210
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,520
Speaker 6:  to understand why because this does ape the shape and the

211
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,480
Speaker 6:  movements of not just to zombie movie, but there are also

212
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,200
Speaker 6:  traces of things like children of men in this. There

213
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,000
Speaker 6:  are shades of the road in this for the cor mc McCarthy fans,

214
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Speaker 6:  right. It's, it's obvious, it's easy to see why the studios saw to themselves,

215
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,840
Speaker 6:  oh this has to be on the big screen. Yeah. But is often the case with

216
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,760
Speaker 6:  video game projects, you know, they get stuck in development. Hell, it

217
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,120
Speaker 2:  Was messy

218
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:35,320
Speaker 6:  And ultimately, you know, it finds its home. The project finds its

219
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,040
Speaker 6:  home on H B O as a series, which,

220
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,840
Speaker 6:  you know, the general understanding is that the adaptation curse is not specific

221
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,720
Speaker 6:  to movies. It's like, no, no, no. Once you try to turn a video game into

222
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,720
Speaker 6:  anything that's not a video game, it just be instantly becomes bad. But again,

223
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,520
Speaker 6:  because the last of us at its core was always crafted with such

224
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,280
Speaker 6:  a cinematic style of storytelling in mind, what we've

225
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,120
Speaker 6:  seen, what you and I have seen people who are listening, being to watch the

226
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,360
Speaker 6:  show we're seeing is a lot of the show is like a pretty faithful,

227
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,160
Speaker 6:  you know, there are, yeah, let's say maybe 60% faithful

228
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,560
Speaker 6:  recreations and there are other 40% or things that are different, but it's

229
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,160
Speaker 6:  like, oh, this is just what I didn't see on camera. Cuz I didn't,

230
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,680
Speaker 6:  I wasn't facing in that direction while I was playing.

231
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,160
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I think that's, that's really, that's one of the things I've kind of

232
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,800
Speaker 2:  liked about it is because I played the game and I hate zombies. They terrify

233
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,120
Speaker 2:  me. And so like, playing the game was the worst experience in the world.

234
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,920
Speaker 2:  Cause like I'll play it. Everybody loves it, I gotta play it. My brother

235
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,400
Speaker 2:  would come over and do his laundry and I'd be like, can you beat this part

236
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,280
Speaker 2:  cuz I'm too scared like a grown ass woman asking my brother to do

237
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,240
Speaker 2:  this. But that's why I liked the, the movie is I was like, oh, I can just

238
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,240
Speaker 2:  skip to the cut scenes. I don't have to worry about mowing down all these

239
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,160
Speaker 2:  guys or sneaking past all of these, these zombies. I can just get to

240
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,120
Speaker 2:  the good parts, the reason that I played the game and, and have historically

241
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,040
Speaker 2:  played naughty dog games. But there were, there were definitely some, some

242
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,320
Speaker 2:  changes here. And I wanna talk about some of those. The first one we're gonna

243
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,200
Speaker 2:  talk about is the death of Tess. Presumably everybody's

244
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,920
Speaker 2:  listening to this very different from the game cuz the game, her death happens

245
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,520
Speaker 2:  off camera and it's by humans. And in this she

246
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,320
Speaker 2:  frenches a zombie.

247
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,640
Speaker 6:  It's a, it's a heroic noble sacrifice. And she's like, Joel,

248
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,480
Speaker 6:  they got me,

249
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,120
Speaker 2:  They

250
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,400
Speaker 6:  Got me. They got me. Joel, and I'm glad we're talking about this because

251
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,240
Speaker 6:  in this first episode, Tess has sort of been won over on the idea

252
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,880
Speaker 6:  of Ellie being potentially like the savior Yeah. Of humanity.

253
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,840
Speaker 6:  And that's also something that, that is not unlike the show or rather unlike

254
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,800
Speaker 6:  the game, but the show puts a lot more emphasis on it subtly, right?

255
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,560
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's not, it's not exactly the most, like they're not beating you over

256
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,200
Speaker 6:  the head with it, but there are more people who are sort of aware of Ellie's

257
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,800
Speaker 6:  specialness and it sort of inspires them to

258
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,720
Speaker 6:  rise to do heroic things in order to make sure that she and Joel are

259
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,080
Speaker 6:  able to, to like make it away. And the first, one of the first big examples

260
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,640
Speaker 6:  of this is us seeing Tess, you know, decide to,

261
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,520
Speaker 6:  she blows the thing up. There's a bunch of cor decept zombies coming in

262
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,000
Speaker 6:  and they swarm her and, and

263
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,560
Speaker 2:  She's trying to light the the lighter.

264
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,800
Speaker 6:  Can I tell you that's one of my least favorite tropes. I've never had a lighter

265
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,240
Speaker 6:  just like stay lit also when I like let it go. So this whole like, I'm gonna

266
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,120
Speaker 6:  throw it dramatically,

267
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,320
Speaker 2:  Zippos will do it, but zippos also light easy and I was just like,

268
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,880
Speaker 2:  I know you're dying. I know you're scared but can you like,

269
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,760
Speaker 2:  can you focus for half a second,

270
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,480
Speaker 6:  Do it with some intentionality and then just set it down.

271
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,520
Speaker 2:  When I saw that moment where it's a really violent, really, really

272
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,480
Speaker 2:  kind of gross moment, her death in this versus the game, the game is like

273
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,840
Speaker 2:  happens off camera and yes you can technically go back and look at her body

274
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,200
Speaker 2:  and be like <unk> That was my jewel impression by the way.

275
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,920
Speaker 2:  You can technically do that. But in this it's like, no, she's gonna have

276
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,800
Speaker 2:  a very graphic death and you are gonna know she's dead. And it felt

277
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,720
Speaker 2:  really kind of cruel to me. I was like okay,

278
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:56,040
Speaker 2:  I didn't need that. Like one Anna to is doing a great job of getting

279
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,880
Speaker 2:  us to care about this character. She's doing a great job of developing relationships

280
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,720
Speaker 2:  with these other characters. So like we feel her relationship

281
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,280
Speaker 2:  and her commitment to Ellie in a way that didn't always necessarily

282
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,680
Speaker 2:  translate in the game. And we feel that relationship with her and Joel in

283
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,400
Speaker 2:  a way that didn't translate in the game. And then to be like, no, now

284
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,160
Speaker 2:  she's gonna like make out with a zombie.

285
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:23,080
Speaker 6:  My reading The Zombie made out with her, the zombie was very much like, come

286
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,520
Speaker 6:  on, come on. And she was like, look, where else am I gonna go? I know what

287
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,320
Speaker 6:  you mean as you alluded to earlier. I'm neutral on the show. I think

288
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,920
Speaker 6:  it's fine. Right. Yeah, I think it is definitely, it's one of the better

289
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,040
Speaker 6:  apocalyptic zombie shows out in the past 10

290
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,960
Speaker 6:  years let's say, in that I just like that it moves. There

291
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,280
Speaker 6:  are other series like The Walking Dead that really do meander and spend too

292
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,680
Speaker 6:  much time focusing on petty human things that I understand. That's, I can

293
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,720
Speaker 6:  understand that that's, that's where the comics exist. That's where, you

294
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,840
Speaker 6:  know, they are sort of most comfortable. But after a while it's like, I don't

295
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,800
Speaker 6:  care about cannibals doing, doing silly things that, you know,

296
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,360
Speaker 6:  hurt people.

297
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,280
Speaker 2:  I'm focused on these two characters. Let's move along. Let's get 'em to

298
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,360
Speaker 2:  Colorado. That

299
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,840
Speaker 6:  Being said, something that I, I came to feel about this show as I watched

300
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,840
Speaker 6:  all nine episodes is because, so it is a very, it is a really

301
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,000
Speaker 6:  faithful adaptation of the game, but because it is a television show, there

302
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,480
Speaker 6:  are some things that are structurally different about it and in a way that

303
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,480
Speaker 6:  like when you play through a video game as you're progressing through, we

304
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,040
Speaker 6:  don't really think about games as levels anymore, but they're just sort of

305
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,200
Speaker 6:  vignettes that you sort of play through. When I'm sitting down to play a

306
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,000
Speaker 6:  video game, it's almost kind of like interactive theater for me.

307
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,680
Speaker 6:  There is a certain degree to which I do not

308
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,640
Speaker 6:  think or worry too much about the logistics

309
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,280
Speaker 6:  of how people move around the world. I I don't think I'm unique in that

310
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,080
Speaker 6:  and there is some of that here in the game or rather here in the show.

311
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:51,080
Speaker 6:  But one of the things that I came away feeling because of the show's structure

312
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,240
Speaker 6:  it all, it has a way of creating this kind of like character of the week

313
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,680
Speaker 6:  kind of scenario. Yeah. Where just as a

314
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,440
Speaker 6:  character has had a chance to exist on screen and really

315
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,160
Speaker 6:  sell you on them as a person and how they fit into this world, they end up

316
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,960
Speaker 6:  dying. Which again is not unique, especially in

317
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,720
Speaker 6:  an apocalyptic show, but they always end up

318
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,520
Speaker 6:  dying in a way that to me felt as if it was meant to sort of

319
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,080
Speaker 6:  make you go, oh wow. Damn, that's sad. And

320
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,800
Speaker 6:  while I, I totally appreciate that being the intended

321
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,920
Speaker 6:  response, there comes a point at which the

322
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,520
Speaker 6:  mm I don't wanna say manufactured this, but sort of the intentional working

323
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,440
Speaker 6:  towards that feeling kind of started to feel hollow for

324
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:36,600
Speaker 6:  me.

325
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:40,600
Speaker 2:  I get that. I think you can, you can see the structure of this show

326
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,360
Speaker 2:  really clearly in a way that you don't always. And so like on the last of

327
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,080
Speaker 2:  us, I don't think this is a spoiler, those odd number episodes tend to be

328
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,920
Speaker 2:  like flashbacks. We're gonna stop and we're gonna sit with a character and

329
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,760
Speaker 2:  we're gonna really think about them. Even number episodes are like, we gonna

330
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,680
Speaker 2:  move through the plot today, Let's get through it. You know, what's coming?

331
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,440
Speaker 2:  Let's go. And so I started to like brace

332
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,240
Speaker 2:  myself cuz especially cuz being aware of these characters and being aware

333
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,120
Speaker 2:  of, of their stories in the game, I was like, okay, I

334
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,560
Speaker 2:  know what's coming next. I know next week is gonna be, we're gonna go deep

335
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,000
Speaker 2:  dive with these two characters and I know what's gonna happen to them probably

336
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,840
Speaker 2:  in that episode or the episode right after. And so I get like, you do

337
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,360
Speaker 2:  feel that kind of manufactured way where you're like, do I actually like

338
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,120
Speaker 2:  this? Is this actually good or am I just like enjoying it because

339
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,920
Speaker 2:  it's an adaptation of something I've enjoyed and I like seeing a new version

340
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,280
Speaker 2:  of it,

341
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:36,320
Speaker 6:  But also because the shape of everyone's arcs, the the

342
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,440
Speaker 6:  specific details when you zoom in are very different. But after a

343
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,400
Speaker 6:  while the pattern does become, here's a new character for you to develop

344
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,280
Speaker 6:  an affinity for, get ready for them to die and for us to return to Eli and

345
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,200
Speaker 6:  Joel. And that's all supposed to serve to rather to reinforce upon

346
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,280
Speaker 6:  you like these are the situations this, these are the circumstances that

347
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,920
Speaker 6:  El and Joel exist in. And I can appreciate that without Yeah. You know, I

348
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,680
Speaker 6:  don't, I don't always need to see, you know, the happy couple

349
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,440
Speaker 6:  who finds love in the apocalypse suddenly die. Oh my God. Aren't you

350
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,440
Speaker 6:  sad? Cuz that happens a couple that happens a couple of times in this show

351
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,360
Speaker 6:  and it's like, alright, alright, I get it, I get it, I

352
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,160
Speaker 6:  get it. But these zo I I, it's, it's funny, I like you

353
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,880
Speaker 6:  am a big old scared cat. Yeah. When it comes to zombies, Zach Snyder's, Don

354
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,520
Speaker 6:  of the Dead truly ruined me for a few years. Right. Just really,

355
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:28,600
Speaker 6:  I, we can talk about that at another time. But with the last

356
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,840
Speaker 6:  of us, I being the weirdo that I am,

357
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,920
Speaker 6:  this being both the gay and the show, putting so much

358
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,560
Speaker 6:  focus on the fungal aspect of the

359
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,320
Speaker 6:  infection. I came into the show really excited

360
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:47,360
Speaker 6:  to see not just the clickers, I wanna see all of it, right? Yeah. I, I wanna

361
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,280
Speaker 6:  see every stage of the infection. And I get that the show doesn't

362
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,600
Speaker 6:  necessarily start off in a place where we're going to be seeing

363
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,640
Speaker 6:  all of them out and about hunting. But one of the things that I,

364
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,600
Speaker 6:  especially at this point where we are in this series now personally,

365
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,680
Speaker 6:  I want to see more, I wanna see more than just can we kiss

366
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,480
Speaker 6:  and I gave you my fungal infection. I wanna see more, I wanna see more

367
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,160
Speaker 6:  fungal armor.

368
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,960
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Well the show, the show is continuing on. We don't wanna spoil

369
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,840
Speaker 2:  the rest of it for, for our audience. I assume a lot of you who are listening

370
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,880
Speaker 2:  to this are watching the show. I love it. If you're listening to this and

371
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,760
Speaker 2:  you haven't been watching the show, sorry for the spoilers, I'm sorry.

372
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,280
Speaker 2:  You're gonna have to go Google like Tess make out Zombie

373
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:32,520
Speaker 6:  Do that Halloween costume. Like that's, start thinking about

374
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,480
Speaker 2:  That now. That's a good costume. I think we, we, you know, we might come

375
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,920
Speaker 2:  back to this. This is, this is still gonna be a really big adaptation. Do

376
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,840
Speaker 2:  you think this is gonna be a sea change for video adaptations? Do you think

377
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,480
Speaker 2:  people are gonna stop hand ringing about it? Especially as games themselves

378
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,120
Speaker 2:  have often gotten more cinematic?

379
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:51,200
Speaker 6:  I think the more interesting thing to pay attention to is if and how

380
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,080
Speaker 6:  games really start posturing themselves to lend themselves to adaptations

381
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,880
Speaker 6:  better. And I don't think that's necessarily going to mean everything is

382
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,280
Speaker 6:  going to be third person. Every game is just gonna give all of its

383
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:05,240
Speaker 6:  NPCs like, you know, wiki in trees that you can just click through and it's

384
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,120
Speaker 6:  like, ooh, I know who's gonna play this person. It's not necessarily gonna

385
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,080
Speaker 6:  be that, but I think it is gonna be interesting to see if more developers

386
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:15,320
Speaker 6:  try to start positioning their games for this kind

387
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:15,600
Speaker 6:  of thing.

388
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,240
Speaker 2:  Kinda like comics have been doing the last like 10, 15 years

389
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,160
Speaker 2:  where they're like, this is actually just like our pitch for the movie you

390
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,240
Speaker 2:  should make instead. Yeah,

391
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:24,600
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

392
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,280
Speaker 2:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's why Captain Marvel exists.

393
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,680
Speaker 2:  Sorry, love Captain Marvel. Great movie, but it

394
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:35,600
Speaker 2:  exists because they wanted to make a movie. The comic does. Well, thank you

395
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,000
Speaker 2:  Charles. This has been a wonderful conversation. Of course. You're gonna

396
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,800
Speaker 2:  have to come on again. We'll do, let's do like a two hour episode on Super

397
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,320
Speaker 2:  Mario Brothers the movie. And Wyatt's arguably one of the most

398
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,400
Speaker 2:  interesting film adaptations of a game.

399
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:51,400
Speaker 6:  This is something that we can a hundred percent agree on. So yes.

400
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,560
Speaker 2:  Yeah, we're gonna do it. Get excited, we'll do that and we'll be like, oh

401
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,160
Speaker 2:  yeah. And then also there's this other supermarket movie. It's great. But

402
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,240
Speaker 2:  thank you so much Charles,

403
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,440
Speaker 6:  This is great.

404
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,320
Speaker 2:  We're gonna take a break and when we get back we're gonna be talking with

405
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,320
Speaker 2:  Margaret all about non-competes

406
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:20,020
Speaker 2:  Support for today's show comes from Deloitte. What does the future look

407
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,780
Speaker 2:  like? It's a question that drives progress, but more importantly, how do

408
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:27,380
Speaker 2:  you get there? It's curiosity, resourcefulness and bold

409
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,220
Speaker 2:  ideas that can drive us even further than new technology. Because

410
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,940
Speaker 2:  while technology can take you far human exploration could take you even

411
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,260
Speaker 2:  farther. Deloitte helps businesses build the future only they can imagine

412
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:42,420
Speaker 2:  by melding deep business acumen and innovative technology with a

413
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:46,320
Speaker 2:  vast team of tech savvy professionals. Unlock technology as powerful as

414
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,720
Speaker 2:  your vision and push the boundaries of the possible so that you can stay

415
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,440
Speaker 2:  a step ahead with the thinking to help you transform what's next into

416
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,080
Speaker 2:  what's now helping you see the extraordinary potential in the seemingly ordinary

417
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,440
Speaker 2:  while blending the possible with the practical is what Deloitte does.

418
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,360
Speaker 2:  See how you can engineer advantage with Deloitte at

Speaker 2:  deloitte.com/us/engineering advantage.

420
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:17,140
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. So a few weeks ago and after months of

421
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,900
Speaker 2:  investigation, the FTC announced its plan to get rid of the non-compete in

422
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,020
Speaker 2:  the United States. The

423
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,700
Speaker 7:  Rule would make it illegal for a company to enter into a new non-compete

424
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,580
Speaker 7:  agreement with a worker or maintain an existing non-compete. And

425
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,500
Speaker 7:  companies would mostly not be allowed to tell workers they're subject to

426
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,740
Speaker 7:  non-compete clauses.

427
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:38,380
Speaker 2:  A lot of people have had feelings about that and there's a lot of concern

428
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:42,060
Speaker 2:  that without non-competes innovation and companies is just gonna like falter.

429
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,060
Speaker 2:  But I personally don't think that's true. California has basically never

430
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:49,540
Speaker 2:  permitted the enforcement of non-competes. And Silicon Valley, which is like

431
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:53,180
Speaker 2:  hugely innovative, has thrived partially because of that.

432
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,460
Speaker 2:  But you shouldn't just believe me and that's why I'm talking to Margaret

433
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,900
Speaker 2:  O'Mara, she's a historian at the University of Washington, an author of several

434
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:03,300
Speaker 2:  books including the Code, which is all about the creation of Silicon Valley

435
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,460
Speaker 2:  as we know it.

436
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,420
Speaker 2:  So Margaret, thank you for joining us today.

437
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,780
Speaker 8:  It's great to be here. Thanks for having me.

438
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:17,620
Speaker 2:  I was really excited to talk to you because obviously there's been a lot

439
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:21,140
Speaker 2:  of discussion about non-competes lately. A lot of hand ringing from

440
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,780
Speaker 2:  certain parts of the world, a lot of like finally

441
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,860
Speaker 2:  from other parts of the world. And what I thought was really interesting

442
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,780
Speaker 2:  was reading your book, the code, you kind of talk about this

443
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,940
Speaker 2:  myth that we've known about, about Silicon Valley for a long time. That

444
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,700
Speaker 2:  the non-compete or the lack of non-competes built Silicon Valley.

445
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,740
Speaker 2:  Would you say that's true?

446
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,740
Speaker 8:  I think it's one factor. You know, it's, it's one of these things that historians

447
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:48,380
Speaker 8:  love. It's this totally serendipitous accidental,

448
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,020
Speaker 8:  it's an accident of history. It's, yeah, there was, the reason

449
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:55,900
Speaker 8:  that Silicon Valley has been advantaged in this particular way

450
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,700
Speaker 8:  has to do with the California state Constitution of, you know,

451
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,660
Speaker 8:  formulated in the late 19th century, which was just trying to kind of, it

452
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:07,180
Speaker 8:  was this hodgepodge of lots of different legal traditions, you know, Spanish,

453
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,740
Speaker 8:  Anglo-American, and long story short just ended up with this provision

454
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:15,620
Speaker 8:  that you could not enforce the non-compete agreement and the way that it

455
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:19,580
Speaker 8:  worked in practice, particularly in early Silicon Valley, meaning in

456
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,540
Speaker 8:  the 1960s when the chip industry is starting, the

457
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,300
Speaker 8:  silicon semiconductor makers that put the silicon in the valley,

458
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:31,580
Speaker 8:  that people could easily hop from one company to another.

459
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,260
Speaker 8:  And, and certainly employers kind of tried to prevent

460
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:39,420
Speaker 8:  IP from, from traveling with them, right. But they really,

461
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:43,880
Speaker 8:  they really couldn't. And so it was incredibly generative and allowed

462
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,200
Speaker 8:  tacit knowledge and experience and technical knowledge to go from

463
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,840
Speaker 8:  one place to another quite easily

464
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:53,400
Speaker 2:  Because there was only a couple of, of these, these chip makers

465
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,120
Speaker 2:  there. And then suddenly there was a ton and you look and you're like, wait,

466
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:01,080
Speaker 2:  you all seem to start at like Fairchild and you all just kinda

467
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,920
Speaker 2:  left. And then like Intel, Intel was started by two guys from Fairchild,

468
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,800
Speaker 2:  right? Yeah. Would Intel exist now? I mean obviously

469
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,640
Speaker 2:  it might exist now, but yeah. If non-competes had been enforceable in

470
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,240
Speaker 2:  California, would Intel have grown as as much as it did then?

471
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:20,440
Speaker 8:  Gosh, I don't know. I mean there's, yeah, I mean, I think just broadly the

472
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,800
Speaker 8:  incredibly generative nature of lots of small firms kind of networked

473
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,760
Speaker 8:  small firms was really enabled by this kind of fluidity

474
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,640
Speaker 8:  in the marketplace. And you know, part of it was kind of a, we're

475
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,440
Speaker 8:  making this up as we go along element to it. I, I

476
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,400
Speaker 8:  like to think about the early Valley as kind of like the Galapagos Islands

477
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,200
Speaker 8:  where you are removed from other

478
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:47,760
Speaker 8:  inputs. You're kind of in this very isolated space. I mean, keep in mind

479
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,400
Speaker 8:  the only other thing going on there was growing apricots

480
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,080
Speaker 8:  and fruit orchard. You know, there's just not, this wasn't an

481
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,080
Speaker 8:  industrial area like say Boston

482
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:03,680
Speaker 8:  or you know, New York or other places that the electronics industry

483
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,600
Speaker 8:  and the computer industry was growing at that time. And so, and these were

484
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,560
Speaker 8:  young, younger people. The the guys who ended up out there

485
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,360
Speaker 8:  were there in part because they didn't have connections and money.

486
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,200
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And, and they didn't have a lot of managerial experience

487
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,960
Speaker 8:  or a lot of, you know, being non, non-hierarchical and having

488
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,720
Speaker 8:  kind of flat management structures was also something really highly valued

489
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,560
Speaker 8:  in the early valley.

490
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:31,560
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And you talk about in, in the book that some of these initial companies,

491
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:35,040
Speaker 2:  the managers were just bad. Like, you'd go and you'd work for a guy and he'd

492
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,800
Speaker 2:  be a genius, but he'd be terrible to work with. And so these guys would go,

493
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,520
Speaker 2:  wait a minute, I can take a lot of the ideas I have here and just go start

494
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,320
Speaker 2:  my own company and not work for this jackass.

495
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:49,120
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Turns out being a Nobel Prize winner does not

496
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,400
Speaker 8:  necessarily mean you're gonna be a great boss. The most

497
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:56,320
Speaker 8:  notoriously bad boss that really kind of gets this flywheel going

498
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:00,400
Speaker 8:  is William Shockley the go inventor of the transistor. He's the person who

499
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:04,800
Speaker 8:  brings out these super talented young engineers to work for

500
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,640
Speaker 8:  him at his, his newly created Shockly Semiconductor,

501
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,360
Speaker 8:  which is the very first semiconductor startup in the valley in the mid fifties.

502
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:16,440
Speaker 8:  He's impossible to work for. He has a lot of other not very great

503
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,280
Speaker 8:  character traits and eight of them band

504
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,160
Speaker 8:  together find someone who's going to help them

505
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,400
Speaker 8:  find financing and start their own company. And

506
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:32,440
Speaker 8:  yeah, there was no, you know, the long arm of California law

507
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,120
Speaker 8:  couldn't come in and say, no, you can't do that. And then in turn, when

508
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,560
Speaker 8:  the Fairchild semiconductor, which was that new company when that got

509
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:43,720
Speaker 8:  to be the, you know, know the people who had financed that were being

510
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,560
Speaker 8:  a little bit obstinate about allowing the, the people who work

511
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,040
Speaker 8:  there to do what they wanted to do. Shocking. Yeah. They left and went on

512
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,680
Speaker 8:  to start their own companies or go to other companies and see these ideas.

513
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,600
Speaker 8:  So yeah, there's this ability to just jump ship and, and go that is,

514
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,160
Speaker 8:  it's, you know, contributing to it. I mean one of the really cool things

515
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,920
Speaker 8:  about all of this is that, you know, we all wanna kind of point to here's

516
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,040
Speaker 8:  this one thing that made everything happen. Yes. And actually it's a lot

517
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,760
Speaker 8:  of things working together, but the non-competes is this sort of wonderful

518
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:16,640
Speaker 8:  oddball circumstance that underscores how,

519
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,520
Speaker 8:  you know, sometimes you can't, things you don't expect will be

520
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,480
Speaker 8:  really consequential. And also these like distinctions of

521
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,240
Speaker 8:  geography actually really do matter. The, the kind of state what state law

522
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,280
Speaker 8:  is like has a is consequential.

523
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:34,560
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I think a lot of times my kind of go-to on non-competes is Mark

524
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,240
Speaker 2:  Papermaster in the, the mid two thousands he was at I B M,

525
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:42,360
Speaker 2:  he was overseeing a lot of their chip business there. Tony

526
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,120
Speaker 2:  Fidel leaves Apple, he was the creator of the iPod. He leaves and

527
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,360
Speaker 2:  they say, okay, we're gonna bring in Mark Papermaster. And they bring him

528
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,560
Speaker 2:  in and IBM's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. And because he'd signed

529
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:55,400
Speaker 2:  his contract in New York and not in California, he went to court

530
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,120
Speaker 2:  and he, he ended up settling and couldn't work for six months, was

531
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,760
Speaker 2:  unemployed by Apple for six months, worked there for a year and then left

532
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:06,760
Speaker 2:  like just ruined kind of his career. And that wouldn't have happened

533
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,400
Speaker 2:  in California necessarily if he'd signed all those contracts additionally.

534
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:14,680
Speaker 8:  Yeah. And look, you know, the, you know, part of this story, this California

535
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,680
Speaker 8:  noncompete story is also, you know, the early days, of course these companies

536
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:21,080
Speaker 8:  are incorporated in California, they're just in California. Yeah. Now we

537
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,640
Speaker 8:  have tech companies that have, you know, they may be headquartered in California,

538
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,800
Speaker 8:  but they're all over the world. So, you know, the stories could become a

539
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,520
Speaker 8:  little more murky too. Right, right. We do have instances in which very

540
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,880
Speaker 8:  valuable talent and ideas try to move and the

541
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,880
Speaker 8:  the, the companies try to claw that back. So the big look, the big Silicon

542
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,400
Speaker 8:  Valley based companies are not immune from that either.

543
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,120
Speaker 8:  But I think there's a real value in recognizing

544
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:51,160
Speaker 8:  innovation rarely happens kind of vertically within the silo of

545
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,000
Speaker 8:  one company. Yeah. It usually happens with a lot of different places.

546
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:58,600
Speaker 8:  Inputs, you know, this is the real contrast drawn between

547
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:02,760
Speaker 8:  the early Valley and Boston's Route 1 28, which was

548
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,480
Speaker 8:  a lot of big companies where things were within. And the east coast more

549
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,360
Speaker 8:  generally was a lot of big companies like, like at and t and Bell

550
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,040
Speaker 8:  Labs, which is where Shockley started and the ability

551
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:17,920
Speaker 8:  to kind of, you know, have these smaller firms, multiple

552
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,800
Speaker 8:  smaller firms rather than one single one seems to have been, you know,

553
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,760
Speaker 8:  you can track, there's just more ideas being generated and new things

554
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,240
Speaker 8:  happening.

555
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:30,320
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Let's, let's talk a little bit more about the east coast side of things

556
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:34,440
Speaker 2:  because pre shockly, pre Fairchild, it was the east coast where

557
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,560
Speaker 2:  most of the development was happening. That was where a lot of the universities

558
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,480
Speaker 2:  were. That was where a lot of the, the, the big companies were. And then

559
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,800
Speaker 2:  it slowly moved to Silicon Valley and part of that was was because of the

560
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,760
Speaker 2:  non-competes because Boston and, and New York, yeah. They'd enforce them.

561
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,720
Speaker 2:  They'd keep these guys from it.

562
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,480
Speaker 8:  Right. Yeah. And well, and it was that sort of enforcement I think is one

563
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,040
Speaker 8:  piece of kind of a broader story

564
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,200
Speaker 2:  Of yeah, maybe

565
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,080
Speaker 8:  Let's call it more conservative business culture or you know, this is

566
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,640
Speaker 8:  the way we do things. You know, keep in mind that in the

567
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,240
Speaker 8:  middle part of the 20th century, a lot of this advanced electronics,

568
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,760
Speaker 8:  particularly miniature electronics, was really state of the art.

569
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,280
Speaker 8:  Not, you know, it was risky business. Like, oh, there's not a, you know,

570
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,720
Speaker 8:  what's the use case? The thing that was, you know, the flywheel that was

571
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,640
Speaker 8:  really creating a market in large part was the Cold

572
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,320
Speaker 8:  War and military spending and the US government was ordering up these

573
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:29,480
Speaker 8:  esoteric high-tech things, but more broadly in the commercial

574
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,520
Speaker 8:  side. Yeah. There was a commercial computer industry in the fifties and sixties,

575
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:36,440
Speaker 8:  a huge one. It was almost entirely had ordered on the east coast. And that's

576
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,320
Speaker 8:  another thing that's kind of gets lost in the story. Yeah. You

577
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,080
Speaker 8:  have these really early super important milestones of

578
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,480
Speaker 8:  computing that are happening on the east coast. I mean, a really important

579
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,960
Speaker 8:  part of this whole history is the very first all digital pro

580
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,720
Speaker 8:  programmable computer is the Neac, which is developed at the

581
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,040
Speaker 8:  University of Pennsylvania. Penn in Philly in comes out in

582
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,120
Speaker 8:  1946. The inventors of that try to

583
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,560
Speaker 8:  commercialize it. Penn makes it super, super

584
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,920
Speaker 8:  difficult for them to do so. And

585
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:12,880
Speaker 8:  ultimately they kind of leave their jobs at the university and they

586
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:16,160
Speaker 8:  don't have kind of financing. They, you know, look the university, other

587
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,840
Speaker 8:  kind of financiers there were not that interested in investing. They

588
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,720
Speaker 8:  commercialize as this startup called univac, which creates a

589
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,560
Speaker 8:  commercial version of this. This is really the first, you know, in the very

590
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,040
Speaker 8:  early days of computing, UNIVAC kind of was synonymous with computer in the

591
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,880
Speaker 8:  way that Kleenex is with facial tissue and Google is with

592
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,320
Speaker 8:  search, right? Yeah. Just for a brief period. But they had to kind of go

593
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,600
Speaker 8:  on their own. And you know, it's a really

594
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:45,960
Speaker 8:  good example of this, well we don't wanna, you know, we don't wanna

595
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,760
Speaker 8:  invest in this new thing. Like what are you gonna do with that? How are you

596
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,520
Speaker 8:  gonna make money? And, and whereas on the west coast there was,

597
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:56,280
Speaker 8:  you know, a different, you know, it was less, there were fewer

598
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,680
Speaker 8:  established institutions that were ready to stay. No.

599
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,160
Speaker 8:  And there was now this big stream of money coming in,

600
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,800
Speaker 8:  particularly in places like California that had to do with military

601
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,640
Speaker 8:  spending. And so that's a, a wave that these small firms got to ride.

602
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:12,360
Speaker 8:  Yeah,

603
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,440
Speaker 2:  No, that's cool that they, they kind of, they wrote it and then they created

604
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,400
Speaker 2:  Silicon Valley and like Yeah, now everything's there. Now it's California's

605
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,600
Speaker 2:  what the fifth largest economy in the world or something incredible like

606
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:22,800
Speaker 2:  that.

607
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:26,920
Speaker 8:  Yeah. It's enormous. You know, it's, it also points to like, we can also

608
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,640
Speaker 8:  look and see kind of what matters and what doesn't. Right. So,

609
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,600
Speaker 8:  you know, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and business leaders have,

610
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,560
Speaker 8:  you know, forever been complaining about California taxes and they are

611
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,200
Speaker 8:  high for sure. And certainly here in my state of

612
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,920
Speaker 8:  Washington, there's, it's definitely been a regional advantage that there's

613
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,680
Speaker 8:  no state income tax and other things that kind of tech firms have used

614
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,440
Speaker 8:  to leverage to recruit people and to grow. But look, if we

615
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,240
Speaker 8:  really look at the sort of, what is the thing, if Thai taxes

616
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:01,000
Speaker 8:  were deterrent to a high-tech cluster growing and

617
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,680
Speaker 8:  innovation happening, then California would've been, wouldn't have start

618
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,840
Speaker 8:  begun in the first place. You know, there are kind of other things. So this,

619
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,640
Speaker 8:  this non-compete story is a great example of, there are other things, a

620
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,400
Speaker 8:  state conditions that a state law can create

621
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,040
Speaker 8:  or local business climate that are actually more important

622
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:23,040
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Than whether it's a high tax or a low tax place.

623
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,000
Speaker 8:  And of course if you're a really low tax region, then you know, I mean taxes

624
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,440
Speaker 8:  pay for public amenities. So one of the things that grew California, certainly

625
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,160
Speaker 8:  in the middle part of the 20th century was, yes, it was high taxes, but they

626
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,880
Speaker 8:  were spending a lot on building roads and schools and infrastructure and

627
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,400
Speaker 8:  all these things that were making it pretty easy and

628
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,200
Speaker 8:  interest. You know, people were drawn to migrate to California because of

629
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:46,360
Speaker 8:  that.

630
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:50,360
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I know. And they did not go to Texas. Well we had ti

631
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:51,920
Speaker 2:  we had ti at Tandy.

632
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:55,600
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I mean a lot. Look, a lot of people went to Texas. It's great. Yeah.

633
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,440
Speaker 8:  Another reminder too is like, you know, people are like, oh, Texas is the

634
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,440
Speaker 8:  new high-tech capital. And you're like, well actually they've been doing

635
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,120
Speaker 8:  that stuff for a long time. Yeah, yeah. Like this is, you know,

636
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,120
Speaker 8:  nothing's as new as you think. That's the other thing. History professors

637
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,880
Speaker 8:  always like to chime in, be like, this isn't new. We've been doing this for

638
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,080
Speaker 8:  a while.

639
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:18,240
Speaker 2:  It's true though. Yeah. I think a lot of people in California are like, oh,

640
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,680
Speaker 2:  you're making non-competes out, getting rid of non-competes. That's not new.

641
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,640
Speaker 2:  We've been doing that for decades. Yeah. Since, since the beginning,

642
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,640
Speaker 8:  Since 1870.

643
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:31,400
Speaker 2:  Well do so, so it sounds like non-competes are, are just kind of one

644
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,840
Speaker 2:  part of this big puzzle for, for the development of Silicon Valley, but they

645
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,800
Speaker 2:  really did enable a lot of these firms to be much more creative, to

646
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,440
Speaker 2:  let people bounce around to to, to create that kind of ingenuity

647
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:46,160
Speaker 2:  that we think of as like a hallmark of the region.

648
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:50,760
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I think that's right. And I think, you know, what it underscores,

649
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,480
Speaker 8:  I think for wherever you are is that the tech

650
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,280
Speaker 8:  industry, it's, it's not about necessarily the tech, it's about the

651
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,760
Speaker 8:  people, right. The people who, who create the ideas

652
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:06,160
Speaker 8:  and that, you know, the, the moving back and forth and the

653
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,040
Speaker 8:  willingness to, you know, I think what it also does is, it's not to say

654
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,600
Speaker 8:  that Silicon Valley has not always been an extremely competitive place.

655
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,760
Speaker 8:  These, all these little chip makers in the sixties, you would not, I mean

656
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:21,600
Speaker 8:  the elbows were sharp. Yeah, yeah. They were, they were hustling

657
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,320
Speaker 8:  hard to out to outrun one another. But you do create

658
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,600
Speaker 8:  kind of this collaborative ecosystem

659
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,960
Speaker 8:  of people, you know, just a lot of connective tissue

660
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,480
Speaker 8:  across firms. And that over time is really

661
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,400
Speaker 8:  generative. If you actually look at the, I love Steve Jobs once,

662
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,960
Speaker 8:  the metaphor that he used, which I really love is talk, he talks about passing

663
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,480
Speaker 8:  the baton. Yeah. Which is one generation kind of

664
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,040
Speaker 8:  passes the baton to the next in tech. And so that's the other thing. There's

665
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,840
Speaker 8:  kind of this lateral movement at during a certain tech generation

666
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,760
Speaker 8:  and then it also turns over to, you know, this, the people making

667
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,680
Speaker 8:  microchips are the mentors and the investors of

668
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,280
Speaker 8:  the people making desktop computers. And then those people

669
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:10,320
Speaker 8:  are the ones investing and mentoring the early.com

670
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,000
Speaker 8:  companies and on and on. And so that kind of

671
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:18,200
Speaker 8:  collaboration across entities and across time is

672
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:22,440
Speaker 8:  a real secret of Silicon Valley that sometimes gets lost in the

673
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,160
Speaker 8:  shuffle. Cuz we think present tense and future tense is what it, what

674
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,040
Speaker 8:  matters. But actually time and the time

675
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,000
Speaker 8:  it has taken to create this very distinctive community that

676
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,920
Speaker 8:  non-competes helped foster that. Yeah. In the

677
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,160
Speaker 8:  very beginning. That's really what makes it go

678
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:44,160
Speaker 2:  Well. Thank you Margaret. This was super, super informative. I appreciate

679
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,360
Speaker 2:  it you taking the time to come chat.

680
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,320
Speaker 8:  Well delighted to join you. Thanks.

681
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,880
Speaker 2:  We're gonna take another break and when we're back, we're gonna be doing

682
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,960
Speaker 2:  the hotline. Stay tuned.

683
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:06,980
Speaker 2:  Okay. Welcome back. It's time to hear what our listeners are thinking about

684
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:10,940
Speaker 2:  in the tech world. Our VIR hotline is open 24 7 where you can

685
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:14,420
Speaker 2:  leave us messages and ask all of your Burning Tech questions. We selected

686
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:18,340
Speaker 2:  a few to run today, but keep calling, I swear we listen, we

687
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,780
Speaker 2:  wanna hear from you. Our first question comes from Jay in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

688
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,980
Speaker 2:  Let's go right to it.

689
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:27,660
Speaker 9:  Hi, this is Jay from Ann Arbor, Michigan and like

690
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:31,300
Speaker 9:  many of the cast hosts, I am excited

691
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:35,500
Speaker 9:  about U S BBC and as more things use

692
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:39,500
Speaker 9:  US BBC connectors, the problem I'm starting to face

693
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:43,340
Speaker 9:  is that I don't have enough ports to plug everything in.

694
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,220
Speaker 9:  And it doesn't seem like there are as many hubs

695
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:51,100
Speaker 9:  available as there are for U S B A connectors. I've

696
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:54,860
Speaker 9:  read that some of that has to do with the chips that are required

697
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:58,540
Speaker 9:  to make that happen. But I was wondering what your take was.

698
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,380
Speaker 9:  Thanks a lot

699
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,980
Speaker 2:  Jay. We're gonna go ahead and talk to Sean Hollister, who I like

700
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:07,460
Speaker 2:  to think is the verges u S BBC expert. Sean,

701
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,220
Speaker 2:  what's happening with u s bbc?

702
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:13,780
Speaker 10:  Hi Jay. You're absolutely right. It does have something to do with the

703
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:17,580
Speaker 10:  chips. You see there are a lot of companies who want to

704
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:21,700
Speaker 10:  make u s BBC hubs who want to make U s BBC docking stations,

705
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,100
Speaker 10:  but all of them or very very many of them rely on chips from

706
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,900
Speaker 10:  a smaller number of suppliers. And so these chip companies are like,

707
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,800
Speaker 10:  well what do people want out of a USS BBC dock? And most of them

708
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,600
Speaker 10:  say they want a single cable that lets their laptop plug into legacy

709
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:41,720
Speaker 10:  peripherals. And so U S B A continues to be hugely

710
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,000
Speaker 10:  popular. Ethernet doesn't have a replacement yet. Cameras

711
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:49,240
Speaker 10:  have not really switched from big SD cards to micro SD cards.

712
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:53,200
Speaker 10:  And so all of those things are competing for space

713
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:57,120
Speaker 10:  and for capabilities in the chips and

714
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:01,000
Speaker 10:  docks that are made. And so like if I

715
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,200
Speaker 10:  want to get us BBC ports right now I'm kind of limited to

716
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:08,320
Speaker 10:  Thunderbolt four docks. If you want to pay 300, $400,

717
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,960
Speaker 10:  maybe 200 if you're lucky for a Thunderbolt four

718
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:16,040
Speaker 10:  docking station, they're out there, cow digit pluggable, even

719
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,000
Speaker 10:  anchor mix, some of them, each one of them is gonna make you make some kind

720
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,880
Speaker 10:  of trade-offs. Either you're gonna pay a lot of money if you want something

721
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,560
Speaker 10:  that gives you like three downstream usb, four Thunderbolt four

722
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,440
Speaker 10:  ports, or you're going to pay for a lot less capability. I

723
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,400
Speaker 10:  saw one in an anchor that'll give you like two additional U S

724
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,280
Speaker 10:  BBC ports outta your laptop. Ah, but even that costs 200 bucks. It's a

725
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:38,680
Speaker 10:  lot of money.

726
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:42,040
Speaker 2:  Two, only two extra ports. A hundred dollars a port.

727
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:45,560
Speaker 10:  Yeah. Because when you're talking about Thunderbolt four people assume,

728
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,680
Speaker 10:  oh yeah, this person's gonna plug in a bunch of high speed like external

729
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:52,960
Speaker 10:  GPUs and heavy duty storage. It's gonna be rate arrays.

730
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:57,040
Speaker 10:  But then they're also going to have to go to Intel generally and get some

731
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,840
Speaker 10:  fancy chips to do that. Each one of those chips

732
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:04,280
Speaker 10:  generally gives you two ports on a docking station.

733
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:08,360
Speaker 10:  So there'll be one port that'll be the one that goes into your laptop and

734
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,520
Speaker 10:  then you get one downstream port out of that. And then your second chip

735
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,120
Speaker 10:  will probably get you your other two downstream ports. So you'll have your,

736
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,160
Speaker 10:  maybe your monitor will come out of that and you'll have your rate array

737
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,000
Speaker 10:  and then you'll have maybe your a second monitor or, or some other

738
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,120
Speaker 10:  fancy U S BBC device on the other end, but you don't get a lot.

739
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:29,160
Speaker 2:  Yeah, yeah. That sounds like nothing. So if, if Jay or

740
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,720
Speaker 2:  myself wants to add like four or five U s BBC

741
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,560
Speaker 2:  ports, we basically just need to go spend $300

742
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:39,360
Speaker 2:  on a Thunderbolt for Doc in Hope.

743
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:43,000
Speaker 10:  I really wish it was different. That's kind of the case right now. If you

744
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,840
Speaker 10:  go to Amazon, you search for a U US BBC hub, most of them

745
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,240
Speaker 10:  are just gonna have a single u SB connector that plugs into your laptop.

746
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:54,040
Speaker 10:  And then if there's a second U S BBC on it, it might not even be for

747
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,840
Speaker 10:  data, it'll just be a power input. Ugh. So they figure you're gonna

748
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,680
Speaker 10:  plug your laptops CPC power adapter into the hub and then

749
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,160
Speaker 10:  you can get the pass through to your laptop. That way you get that glorious,

750
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,200
Speaker 10:  oh yeah, I can plug this single cable in my laptop. I get my power, it's

751
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,760
Speaker 10:  charging, it's gonna, I can plug my old flash drive in, I can plug my hd,

752
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,600
Speaker 10:  my monitor in, I can plug my ethernet in for Wired internet. They

753
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,200
Speaker 10:  don't expect that you're gonna have all this high speed additional peripherals

754
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,840
Speaker 10:  and that if you do, you're gonna be willing to spend those extra, you know,

755
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,360
Speaker 10:  a hundred, 200, $300 for the Thunderbolt four

756
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:29,240
Speaker 2:  Episode. Is there any hope? Like is there something, did something

757
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,640
Speaker 2:  get announced that ces were there there rumors? Are we, are we gonna get

758
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,240
Speaker 2:  any relief?

759
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:36,560
Speaker 10:  I wish. I think what it's going to take, I think what it's really going

760
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,680
Speaker 10:  to take is when we have

761
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:43,640
Speaker 10:  passed by some of these old legacy peripherals, when people have accepted

762
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,280
Speaker 10:  you don't really need ethernet anymore, you're gonna be fine with wifi,

763
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,120
Speaker 10:  we're getting to the point where WiFi's getting a little more, more reliable.

764
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:53,640
Speaker 10:  You can get back channel three, you know, your 60 gigahertz band

765
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:57,840
Speaker 10:  so that you have that dedicated high speed short range connection to

766
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,880
Speaker 10:  your router, right? Or to your VR headset or something. Maybe you don't

767
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,680
Speaker 10:  need that port anymore in the future. Maybe micro SD

768
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:08,360
Speaker 10:  becomes more reliable. You don't need that. But right now, if you are a

769
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:12,200
Speaker 10:  cheap hub manufacturer in Shenzhen that's trying to put out a

770
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,960
Speaker 10:  whole bunch of hubs for all of these alphabet

771
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,720
Speaker 10:  soup brands and even some of the brands you know about, you are probably

772
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,680
Speaker 10:  going to be buying that chip from a supplier that wants to supply all of

773
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,400
Speaker 10:  those legacy those, you know, those, those peripherals

774
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,680
Speaker 10:  that people wanna plug in that are a little bit more old school.

775
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:34,600
Speaker 2:  Okay. So people like Jay, myself, I am almost completely out of u s

776
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,400
Speaker 2:  BBC ports on my Max Studio at this point. We, we just need to like

777
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:41,960
Speaker 2:  hope that these suppliers start to recognize that there's more of us

778
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,280
Speaker 2:  and we're a market too.

779
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:47,480
Speaker 10:  I think there's that. I also think laptops will pro and desktops will probably

780
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,440
Speaker 10:  just have more of these ports in the future. What frustrates me to No End

781
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:54,920
Speaker 10:  is the USS BBC state on Desktop PCs

782
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,520
Speaker 10:  where yeah, you know, if you're getting a desktop you wanna plug a lot of

783
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:02,400
Speaker 10:  things into it. But the last two motherboards I bought

784
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,840
Speaker 10:  with USS BBC ports on them, they would only have a single port

785
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:09,720
Speaker 10:  on the back of the machine. And what frustrates the heck outta me is you

786
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:13,440
Speaker 10:  know how there's like an IO panel, you need to stick into the back of your

787
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,080
Speaker 10:  PC case to like hold all those ports and keep them from like just

788
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,760
Speaker 10:  electrically touching the sides of your case. Those things are generally

789
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,160
Speaker 10:  springy enough that when I stick a U s BBC cable into the back, it just

790
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,760
Speaker 10:  pushes it right back out again. It like bounces right out. It frustrates

791
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,200
Speaker 10:  the heck outta me if you really just do need more u s BBC ports and you

792
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,000
Speaker 10:  don't care about how fast they are. I have seen a bunch of one

793
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,920
Speaker 10:  port to four port USBC hubs on the internet that it is one

794
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,720
Speaker 10:  thing that the chips are being made for. Just know that they can

795
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,280
Speaker 10:  be really slow. Some of them are just five gigabits per second. That's USB

796
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,080
Speaker 10:  3.0 speeds out of your US BBC ports.

797
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:53,040
Speaker 2:  I hate that. Well, thank you Sean. Jay, I wish the news was

798
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,200
Speaker 2:  better. Sorry.

799
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:59,800
Speaker 2:  Okay, we're gonna kick it to this next question, which I've got Dan

800
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,520
Speaker 2:  Seifert here to answer. Hello roll the tape. Andrew.

801
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:06,800
Speaker 9:  Hey Verge cast hotline. My name is Frank from North Carolina.

802
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,960
Speaker 9:  I have two laptops, one work and one personal, and they both use

803
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,600
Speaker 9:  Thunderbolt four. What is a good option

804
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:18,560
Speaker 9:  to easily switch between the two of them seamlessly without paying for one

805
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,080
Speaker 9:  of those ridiculously expensive KVMs that support

806
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,880
Speaker 9:  Thunderbolt for? Is there a quick and easy solution to this? All right,

807
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:26,600
Speaker 9:  thanks. Bye.

808
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,800
Speaker 2:  All right, Dan, can you help Frank out?

809
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,760
Speaker 11:  Frank, thank you for this question. I love this question. It is a problem

810
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:36,360
Speaker 11:  that's near and dear to my heart, so I relate very well to it. I will say,

811
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:40,120
Speaker 11:  I don't know exactly your setup here, so I'm not sure if you wanna use

812
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:44,000
Speaker 11:  the both of these laptops with the same monitor, mouse and keyboard or

813
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,760
Speaker 11:  if you just want to be able to switch between inputs on them. So we're gonna

814
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,480
Speaker 11:  explore multiple options for you and hopefully you can find

815
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,400
Speaker 11:  something that works for you. So for starters, you mentioned a Thunderbolt

816
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,160
Speaker 11:  four dock. If there's a Thunderbolt four dock that has a built-in KVM switch

817
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:03,120
Speaker 11:  into it, I don't know of it. All of those expensive fancy docks that you

818
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:06,920
Speaker 11:  see on the market with lots of ports and they cost about three to $400 or

819
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,600
Speaker 11:  so. You can't actually switch between inputs on those.

820
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:13,560
Speaker 11:  You can output to multiple displays, but you really can only connect one

821
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,280
Speaker 11:  computer at a time to them. So that's not really the solution. There is

822
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,120
Speaker 11:  a few hardware options for you. There's a basic KVM

823
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:24,720
Speaker 11:  switch. KVM stands for keyboard video and mouse. They've been around for

824
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:29,000
Speaker 11:  eons. The modern ones these days use H D M I inputs

825
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,880
Speaker 11:  and USB ports. And so you would just kind of, if your laptops have

826
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,600
Speaker 11:  just u s BBC on them, you would have to do u s BBC to H D M I and get a

827
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,760
Speaker 11:  converter cable, which is not too hard to do. But basically you plug both

828
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,160
Speaker 11:  laptops into those. You plug your one mouse and your one keyboard into it

829
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,840
Speaker 11:  and you plug your one display into it and then you have a little switch

830
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:49,680
Speaker 11:  on the switch itself to switch between them. So you use one at a time

831
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,440
Speaker 11:  and you just kind of switch between 'em. So that's a very simple hardware

832
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,160
Speaker 11:  solution for you. There is one silly

833
00:48:56,670 --> 00:49:00,440
Speaker 11:  u s BBC four switch U SB four

834
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,240
Speaker 11:  switch that uses u s BBC ports. It's a thousand dollars dev board.

835
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:08,760
Speaker 11:  It takes two u s BBC inputs and it outputs to one u s BBC

836
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,520
Speaker 11:  plug and then you can switch between them. That's an option. I'm just saying

837
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:16,320
Speaker 11:  I'm laying out all the options here. It's not maybe one I'd recommend, but

838
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,960
Speaker 11:  it's an option. And then the last hardware solution for you

839
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:24,320
Speaker 11:  is a lot of big monitors have the ability

840
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,840
Speaker 11:  to accept multiple inputs, whether that's multiple display

841
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,640
Speaker 11:  inputs from two different computers, or also you can

842
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,800
Speaker 11:  connect your keyboard and mouse directly to the monitor and they have built

843
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:38,720
Speaker 11:  in KVM switches on them. And so if your screen is big enough,

844
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,880
Speaker 11:  you can split the screen. You usually see this with like the ultra wide

845
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,840
Speaker 11:  screens. And so one side can be your one, your personal laptop. The

846
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:49,400
Speaker 11:  other side can be your work laptop and there's a KVM switch built into the

847
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:53,280
Speaker 11:  monitor itself so that you can use the same mouse and keyboard to switch

848
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,840
Speaker 11:  between them. So that's another hardware option for you. But if you already

849
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:00,080
Speaker 11:  have a display already, you don't wanna buy a new one or anything like that.

850
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,560
Speaker 11:  There are some software options. Yeah, software,

851
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:07,560
Speaker 11:  yes, software. The first one is Universal control on a Mac. It

852
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:11,440
Speaker 11:  only works between two Mac and they have to share an iCloud account. I'm

853
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,040
Speaker 11:  gonna guess that you don't have two Macs here. Just most people who have

854
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,080
Speaker 11:  a work laptop and a personal laptop don't have two Macs in the same scenario.

855
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:21,720
Speaker 11:  Maybe you do, but if you don't or if you, you do also have to have them

856
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,480
Speaker 11:  both on the same iCloud account, which might be precluded by one of them

857
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,120
Speaker 11:  being work option. So, so Universal Control works really cool, but it's

858
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,640
Speaker 11:  probably not a practical option here. Another software option is called

859
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:35,480
Speaker 11:  Logitech Flow. If you happen to have a modern keyboard or mouse

860
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,720
Speaker 11:  from Logitech, there's an app that you can download on both computers. It

861
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,600
Speaker 11:  works cross Windows and Mac that will let you do the universal

862
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,280
Speaker 11:  control thing. Basically you just move your cursor over to the edge of the

863
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,520
Speaker 11:  screen and it passes it over to the next one and then you click on it and

864
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,880
Speaker 11:  your keyboard will work over on that computer and you can move your mouse

865
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,520
Speaker 11:  back over to the other side. So if you have the right Logitech stuff,

866
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:58,360
Speaker 11:  you can do that. There's a couple of apps I found that don't require

867
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,120
Speaker 11:  specific hardware. They're called Share Mouse and Synergy and they both

868
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,560
Speaker 11:  appear to do the same kind of thing. I've

869
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,040
Speaker 2:  Used Synergy. Yeah,

870
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:09,800
Speaker 11:  It's if you have your computer like open and on and plugged

871
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,600
Speaker 11:  into separate displays, you can use the same mouse and keyboard

872
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,440
Speaker 11:  and just move it between them. With these apps installed, share

873
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,400
Speaker 11:  Mouse is about $81. It does have a free trial that you can try out to see

874
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,360
Speaker 11:  if it works. Synergy is a little bit cheaper. It's about $30. I haven't

875
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,480
Speaker 11:  personally used either of them. Alex has used Synergy. Apparently.

876
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:32,400
Speaker 2:  I've used Synergy. It was, it was years ago. It

877
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:35,880
Speaker 2:  technically gets the job done. Is it

878
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:39,800
Speaker 2:  the prettiest? No, but it it, it works.

879
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:43,520
Speaker 11:  Yeah. I mean it, it'll work if we're trying to do this on a shoestring budget,

880
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,440
Speaker 11:  30 bucks is not bad to spend.

881
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:49,560
Speaker 2:  It just doesn't ever feel as natural as using like the Monitor

882
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,880
Speaker 2:  solution you you offered or those hardware solutions.

883
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,480
Speaker 11:  Yeah, hardware solutions are probably the way to go. I'm gonna recommend

884
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:00,480
Speaker 11:  the easiest setup and I'm gonna assume that you got some space on your

885
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,880
Speaker 11:  desk. I think the easiest setup is to use an external display with your

886
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,680
Speaker 11:  main laptop, which would be like probably your work laptop, right? The one

887
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:10,520
Speaker 11:  that you're, you're spending the most time on. You install one of the apps

888
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:14,480
Speaker 11:  like Synergy onto both computers so you can share your mouse

889
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,000
Speaker 11:  and your keyboard and then you just leave your personal laptop open on the

890
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,960
Speaker 11:  side of your desk and when you wanna like move over to your personal laptop

891
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,280
Speaker 11:  to send a Discord message or an iMessage or whatever it is you're doing

892
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:27,000
Speaker 11:  over there, you just move your cursor over, you do it and then you move

893
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,040
Speaker 11:  back to your work one that's on your big display. I think that's probably

894
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:33,960
Speaker 11:  the most practical, easiest setup, an alternate option for you

895
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:37,640
Speaker 11:  if you're not wanting to use your work laptop and your personal laptop at

896
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:41,160
Speaker 11:  the same time. Like this is kind of like you're like, I've got a work laptop

897
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,040
Speaker 11:  that I do work on, but then I've got a gaming laptop that I only play games

898
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:47,840
Speaker 11:  on. You're probably not like having those active at the same time, but

899
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:51,720
Speaker 11:  what you do there is then you buy a, either a Thunderbolt or u

900
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,320
Speaker 11:  s BBC doc that's got a lot of ports on it. You plug your display and all

901
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,760
Speaker 11:  your peripherals into it, you plug your mouse, your keyboard, ethernet,

902
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,440
Speaker 11:  whatever, your speakers, everything goes into that dock. And then to switch

903
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,400
Speaker 11:  between the computers, you just unplug one cable outta the one and plug

904
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,000
Speaker 11:  it into the other when it's time to play games or something like that. That's

905
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,560
Speaker 11:  what I personally do. I don't usually use two laptops at the same time.

906
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,760
Speaker 11:  When I'm working, I got my work one setup. If I do wanna play games, I pull

907
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:18,040
Speaker 11:  out the gaming laptop and I just switch the cable over from the dock. So

908
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,880
Speaker 11:  those are my solutions. I don't think any of them are super elegant.

909
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:25,040
Speaker 2:  I will say Synergy has gotten prettier than the last time I used

910
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,440
Speaker 2:  it circa like 2013.

911
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:31,520
Speaker 11:  It, it also looks prettier than share mouse. Share Mouse looks pretty

912
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:31,920
Speaker 11:  basic.

913
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:36,120
Speaker 2:  You can sometimes find, I think there might be an open source one

914
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:40,280
Speaker 2:  as well out there, but most of them tend to be a

915
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:44,080
Speaker 2:  little buggy and it usually requires you to like run a server

916
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:45,240
Speaker 2:  essentially.

917
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:49,360
Speaker 11:  Yeah, you do. The way those work is over basically over ad

918
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,920
Speaker 11:  hoc wifi. So you kind of have to have like a, there's, there is

919
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:56,320
Speaker 11:  some kind of like internet like communication and

920
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,960
Speaker 2:  You have to install the software on that, that work computer, which

921
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,920
Speaker 2:  depending on how tight you are with your IT department Yeah, could

922
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:04,520
Speaker 2:  be a problem.

923
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:08,240
Speaker 11:  Exactly. Yeah there there's definitely lots of caveats here in terms of

924
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,920
Speaker 11:  like what your specific setup is and like what you'll be allowed to do.

925
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:15,960
Speaker 11:  I don't think your IT department can get in the way of you using a basic

926
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,240
Speaker 11:  hardware KVM switch like that cuz that's just a matter of plugging things

927
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:22,000
Speaker 11:  in and it's got a hardware switch on it that you just click the button to

928
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,400
Speaker 11:  switch between them. So that might be the most practical solution for you.

929
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:29,760
Speaker 2:  All right, well Frank, please let us know how the KVM hunt goes.

930
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,120
Speaker 2:  Dan, thank you so much.

931
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:35,280
Speaker 11:  Good luck and somebody please make a Thunderbolt for KVM doc

932
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,280
Speaker 11:  switch. I will buy it. Somebody do it please.

933
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:42,200
Speaker 2:  Okay, so our next question is from Mark. Let's give it a listen.

934
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:46,760
Speaker 12:  Hey Verge Travis Mark, I am in soho in

935
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,680
Speaker 12:  New York City and I see this ad going up by meta. It says set up a new era

936
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:54,360
Speaker 12:  of personal privacy with automatic end-to-end encryption

937
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:57,800
Speaker 12:  from WhatsApp. And I just wanna know what's the difference between that

938
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:01,760
Speaker 12:  end-to-end encryption and all the other ones. Is it real? Am I gonna get

939
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,120
Speaker 12:  screwed? Is it good? Please help. Thanks.

940
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:08,240
Speaker 2:  Okay, so to answer this question we had to go to somebody who's been writing

941
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,320
Speaker 2:  about a bunch. Mitchell Clark, is WhatsApp real?

942
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:15,400
Speaker 13:  Yeah, so the T R D R is kind of interesting. End-to-end

943
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:19,200
Speaker 13:  encryption is actually good and it will almost certainly

944
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:23,080
Speaker 13:  not screw you over. That's not the same thing as saying that

945
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,960
Speaker 13:  it's immune to surveillance if that's what you're worried about about cuz

946
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:29,840
Speaker 13:  that's kind of like an entirely different thing. So to go a bit

947
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:33,720
Speaker 13:  deeper into that, you asked how its encryption is different from the other

948
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:37,560
Speaker 13:  apps and the, the kind of interesting thing that I've found is that it is

949
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:41,520
Speaker 13:  not, at least when it comes to Signal, which

950
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,120
Speaker 13:  is kind of like the gold standard for private messaging apps, it uses

951
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:49,120
Speaker 13:  the literally the same protocol as Signal. So in

952
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:52,320
Speaker 13:  terms of whether Meta or the government would be able to read your messages,

953
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:56,520
Speaker 13:  you should be totally fine using WhatsApp. Now the

954
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:00,400
Speaker 13:  thing that the ad doesn't tell you is that in terms of privacy there

955
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,120
Speaker 13:  are 100% better options out there. That's because WhatsApp can

956
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:07,880
Speaker 13:  and almost certainly does collect metadata on your conversations.

957
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:11,440
Speaker 13:  So while it doesn't know what you are saying, it does have a record of who

958
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,160
Speaker 13:  you were talking with when you were talking with them. You know, if y'all

959
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:19,120
Speaker 13:  exchange pictures or whatever like that stuff, it can tell

960
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:22,760
Speaker 2:  That seems not great for people who want end to encryption.

961
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:26,560
Speaker 13:  I'm not saying that it's like lying by a mission, it is

962
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:30,320
Speaker 13:  technically private, it does have end-to-end encryption for

963
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:34,120
Speaker 13:  your messages and those contents, but the metadata it can

964
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,920
Speaker 13:  see and it also collects things like your location information, device

965
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,080
Speaker 13:  information, stuff like that. And that data is super

966
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:45,280
Speaker 13:  valuable. Governments can and have asked Meta to hand it over before.

967
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:49,560
Speaker 13:  And so if you are the type of person who's concerned

968
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:53,680
Speaker 13:  about data collection and overall privacy, then that's

969
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,200
Speaker 13:  something you really wanna consider. Not just with WhatsApp but with a bunch

970
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,400
Speaker 13:  of different apps that say that they support end-to-end encryption because

971
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,080
Speaker 13:  they can, but there's more to that story. So iMessage in

972
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:08,200
Speaker 13:  ocs, it's kind of the same deal with those. The one app that doesn't do

973
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:12,160
Speaker 13:  that is Signal. So there's a feature in it that

974
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,080
Speaker 13:  makes it so that even the company running the app can't tell who you're

975
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:18,920
Speaker 13:  messaging, which is pretty solid. So like in terms of real word

976
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:22,600
Speaker 13:  stuff, meta can read what's on the outside of your envelope that

977
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:26,560
Speaker 13:  you're mailing to someone, your, your thank you cards for Christmas

978
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:30,400
Speaker 13:  presents, which you should be sending right now. Meta can read the address,

979
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,960
Speaker 13:  your address, who, who you're sending it to. And so can a bunch of other

980
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:37,920
Speaker 13:  people who make end-to-end encrypted messaging apps Signal cannot.

981
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:41,840
Speaker 13:  Okay. Neither of them can see what's in that envelope, but there's a difference

982
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,480
Speaker 13:  between how much data they are collecting.

983
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:48,600
Speaker 2:  So like WhatsApp, iMessage, that's gonna make sense for people

984
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:52,640
Speaker 2:  who are talking with their family and friends and maybe just don't want the

985
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:56,120
Speaker 2:  world to know what all salacious things they get up to in their chats.

986
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:59,880
Speaker 2:  And then Signal is like, no, I don't want you to know anything.

987
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:04,120
Speaker 13:  Right. If you are, I don't, I was gonna

988
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,960
Speaker 13:  try to come up with an example. I don't want the FBI to burst into my house,

989
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,840
Speaker 13:  so I'm I'm I'm gonna, I'm gonna leave it very vague, but like the, the

990
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:14,320
Speaker 13:  one rub of this is that if you have friends and family using a messaging

991
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:18,040
Speaker 13:  app that's probably WhatsApp, like the network effect with these

992
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,760
Speaker 13:  messaging apps is really, really strong. So you're not,

993
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,320
Speaker 13:  even if you did want to, you know, convince your mom to use Signal,

994
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:28,640
Speaker 13:  you're probably not gonna have a whole lot of luck with that. It's usually

995
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:32,600
Speaker 13:  a losing battle trying to get people to adopt new messaging apps. So

996
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:36,600
Speaker 13:  if, if you are wondering, I have people wanting me to use WhatsApp,

997
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:40,240
Speaker 13:  does it have this bare minimum level of safety? The answer is yes

998
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,480
Speaker 13:  and it should be totally fine if you're not trying

999
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,960
Speaker 13:  to blow the whistle on illegal government actions

1000
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:52,080
Speaker 13:  or corporate espionage, like for that maybe, maybe choose something

1001
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:52,400
Speaker 13:  different.

1002
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:55,560
Speaker 2:  I love that. All right, thank you Mitchell. Yeah.

1003
00:58:57,230 --> 00:58:59,200
Speaker 2:  Okay, here's the final question for today.

1004
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:03,280
Speaker 14:  So number one, David Pierce, you know my friend, you didn't invite me to

1005
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,480
Speaker 14:  your Christmas party, so let's get through that. Wait, am I supposed to

1006
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,920
Speaker 14:  say my name? Alright. Anyways, but number two voice assistants,

1007
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:13,960
Speaker 14:  like what's going on with voice assistants? It seems like nobody's

1008
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,480
Speaker 14:  doing anything interesting with them anymore. Is it because they can't be

1009
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,160
Speaker 14:  monetized? Can you please fix theory please.

1010
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:23,400
Speaker 2:  All right, well David is not here to invite you to use Christmas party

1011
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:26,480
Speaker 2:  or answer the question, but I've got Jen Tui here.

1012
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:27,160
Speaker 15:  Hi.

1013
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:31,400
Speaker 2:  Hi Jen. Like what's going on is, are things

1014
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,800
Speaker 2:  happening in voice assistant land?

1015
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:37,080
Speaker 15:  Well, it's an interesting question there, multi-part, honestly.

1016
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:40,960
Speaker 15:  You know, I think voice assistants are really quite good right now.

1017
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:45,000
Speaker 15:  I think we've kind of come to expect a lot from them because our other personal

1018
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,960
Speaker 15:  devices are so, you know, intuitive and responsive to us. But

1019
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,640
Speaker 15:  voice assistants, especially in the smart home, kind of have a harder job

1020
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,240
Speaker 15:  than say like your smartphone or your computer where, you know, we've become

1021
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:00,040
Speaker 15:  used to such easy interaction because voice assistants

1022
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,160
Speaker 15:  generally lack the context that say a smartphone does. And the

1023
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,960
Speaker 15:  attempts that companies have made to sort of personalize the various voice

1024
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:11,160
Speaker 15:  assistants who, NA, whose names, I'll try not to say too many times. So

1025
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:14,880
Speaker 15:  not to activate everyone's devices, but those attempts to sort of

1026
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,880
Speaker 15:  personalize them have been, have, haven't worked that well, especially in

1027
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:21,840
Speaker 15:  multi people households. So you may say something

1028
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:25,360
Speaker 15:  to your voice assistant, like, you know, play my playlist and it, it doesn't

1029
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:28,960
Speaker 15:  know who you are. Yeah. And so those things, that's been a bit tricky.

1030
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:32,800
Speaker 15:  Each company has tried to address that, but more often than not it

1031
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:36,680
Speaker 15:  ends up just being frustrating for the user. And generally I would say

1032
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:40,800
Speaker 15:  of the three main voice assistants, each kind of has its pluses

1033
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:44,640
Speaker 15:  and minuses. You know, like Amazon's has a very wide

1034
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:48,120
Speaker 15:  range of capabilities, but that can get hard

1035
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:51,760
Speaker 15:  because it's not specific enough. You know, you might, I've had

1036
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,560
Speaker 15:  examples where I've asked the assistant to, you know, turn on a light

1037
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:59,400
Speaker 15:  switch or do some smart home thing and it'll end up sort of

1038
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,520
Speaker 15:  telling me the latest news headlines because it, it gets confused.

1039
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:07,240
Speaker 15:  So you know that and that's frustrating and because we're so used to things,

1040
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:10,800
Speaker 15:  you know, technology has become so advanced. We're used to things doing

1041
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,560
Speaker 15:  exactly what we expect and voice assistants are la have lagged behind

1042
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:18,480
Speaker 15:  there. You know, like Google is really good for general knowledge, you

1043
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,480
Speaker 15:  know, things like directions, traffic, weather. And then

1044
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:25,800
Speaker 15:  Apple's assistant is so well integrated into the Apple ecosystem,

1045
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:29,720
Speaker 15:  you know, they've just launched some new capabilities like with the HomePod

1046
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:33,360
Speaker 15:  that we just wrote about this week. You know, you can ask your HomePod

1047
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:37,240
Speaker 15:  mini to find your husband if he's gone missing. So it will,

1048
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:40,160
Speaker 15:  you know, like find my on your iPhone now instead of having to pull out

1049
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,600
Speaker 15:  the iPhone you can just say, Hey s where's my husband?

1050
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:48,240
Speaker 15:  And it will give you direct, you know, give you even directions to go

1051
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:51,840
Speaker 15:  find him. Oh wow. And you know, they are adding new features but in general

1052
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:55,920
Speaker 15:  the problem is no one voice assistant does all of these

1053
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,720
Speaker 15:  things. Well, you know? Yeah. You kind of have to pick or choose and, and

1054
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:03,400
Speaker 15:  this, the caller did say specifically, please fix Siri.

1055
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:07,720
Speaker 15:  And that's a leading question. You know, I'd love to know what specifically

1056
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:11,320
Speaker 15:  he, his problem is with Siri personally, as I've written about,

1057
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:15,440
Speaker 15:  I do find Siri to sort of actually be one of the better voice assistants

1058
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,160
Speaker 15:  for smart home control. But anything else or largely anything. Anything

1059
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:22,840
Speaker 15:  else. And it does kind of spin its wheels a lot and I think a lot of them

1060
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:26,680
Speaker 15:  have this problem where you are waiting on them to do what you've asked

1061
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:30,720
Speaker 15:  because they're often relying on a cloud connection and

1062
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,880
Speaker 15:  that, you know, gets frustrating for you sitting there waiting for it to

1063
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:37,400
Speaker 15:  turn the lights on or off or read you the news headlines

1064
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:41,240
Speaker 15:  because you know, one of the issues is in the smart

1065
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:45,160
Speaker 15:  home is if you rely too much on the cloud, the voice assistant has to

1066
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:49,040
Speaker 15:  send the command and then the get the data and bring it back and then do

1067
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:52,920
Speaker 15:  its thing. And you know, in my mind I think voice control works

1068
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:56,800
Speaker 15:  best when it's local, when the connection, everything it it's

1069
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:00,040
Speaker 15:  working on is local. And that's also sometimes where you'll find using the

1070
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:03,800
Speaker 15:  voice assistant on a phone, the ones that work well on a phone

1071
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:08,040
Speaker 15:  is quicker than using it with smart home speakers. And this is

1072
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:11,000
Speaker 15:  actually something and you know, you can't have me on the ver without me

1073
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:11,960
Speaker 15:  mentioning the word matter.

1074
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:17,520
Speaker 15:  It's, this is something for the smart home I think Matter may actually

1075
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:21,240
Speaker 15:  help with because it will help bring all our

1076
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:25,200
Speaker 15:  control of smart home devices locally. Devices will be able to

1077
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:29,120
Speaker 15:  talk directly to each other rather than having to go to the cloud and talk

1078
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:33,320
Speaker 15:  directly to voice assistance. So, you know, that may be an area

1079
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:36,480
Speaker 15:  we're gonna see some improvement. It's gonna take a while though. I think

1080
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,320
Speaker 15:  voice assistance often get the blame because they're the control point.

1081
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:43,920
Speaker 15:  Like you get mad at your smartphone when you know a website's not working

1082
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:47,720
Speaker 15:  or an app's not working when in fact it's quite likely that

1083
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:51,360
Speaker 15:  it's like a device network issue or some connectivity

1084
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,400
Speaker 15:  that's sort of broken in the background and it's not actually their fault,

1085
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,600
Speaker 15:  but that's why you get shoot the messenger.

1086
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:03,000
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I used s and S sometimes doesn't wanna connect

1087
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,920
Speaker 2:  to the internet and it's unclear why and it just likes to return. I can't

1088
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:10,360
Speaker 2:  do that right now. And I'm like, but you can. I know you can

1089
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:13,800
Speaker 15:  And you just did it like 20 minutes ago, why can't you do it now?

1090
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:18,080
Speaker 2:  Now? And it's so frustrating and I know intellectually something's

1091
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:21,960
Speaker 2:  going on here, I need to troubleshoot the wifi, but no, I'm still mad

1092
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,760
Speaker 2:  at this little tiny speaker in my kitchen and I want to throw it against

1093
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:25,400
Speaker 2:  out the window.

1094
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:30,640
Speaker 2:  Do you think we're gonna see more use of

1095
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,720
Speaker 2:  these conversational ais that we've seen like chat G B T, do you think those

1096
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,840
Speaker 2:  are gonna become more involved in these voice assistants or are they gonna

1097
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:41,680
Speaker 2:  continue to be this place where we ask very specific kind of

1098
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:45,400
Speaker 2:  robotic questions to them and they give us those very kit tined

1099
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:46,160
Speaker 2:  answers?

1100
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:50,440
Speaker 15:  Yeah, and so that's another area I think people get frustrated is you

1101
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:54,320
Speaker 15:  have to use for the most part very specific nomenclature. And you know,

1102
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:58,160
Speaker 15:  if you just vary it instead of saying like every day you say every

1103
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,120
Speaker 15:  night and it doesn't know what you're talking about, it is tricky. It's

1104
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:04,960
Speaker 15:  also makes it hard for people in your home who aren't used to using voice

1105
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:08,880
Speaker 15:  assistants to control things because they may say, you know, turn on the

1106
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,680
Speaker 15:  lamp instead of turn on the light and the the voice assistant doesn't

1107
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:16,400
Speaker 15:  know the answer. And these kind of new innovations around

1108
01:05:16,570 --> 01:05:20,440
Speaker 15:  AI is very interesting and I, you know, we had a great piece on

1109
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:23,920
Speaker 15:  the, on the site this week sort of looking, I think someone ki created

1110
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:28,360
Speaker 15:  a really cool voice assistant. Yeah. Using yes.

1111
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:31,560
Speaker 15:  And that was that, that was amazing. And it looked and it was like, yeah

1112
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:34,880
Speaker 15:  this could be the sort of sort of nirvana for voice assistants. But I think

1113
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:38,440
Speaker 15:  people rightly pointed out, when you don't have a tightly

1114
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:42,400
Speaker 15:  controlled ecosystem for a voice assistant, it could get messy and scary

1115
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,560
Speaker 15:  very quickly. Especially like, you know, I

1116
01:05:46,590 --> 01:05:49,800
Speaker 15:  I, I posted this question on, on Twitter a little while ago, like what is

1117
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:52,480
Speaker 15:  it that annoys you most about your voice assistant? And an old colleague

1118
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,000
Speaker 15:  of mine said, well when it plays non toddler friendly versions of old

1119
01:05:56,700 --> 01:06:00,520
Speaker 15:  and it's like, you know, you don't, there are times when you want control,

1120
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:04,560
Speaker 15:  you just don't want the whole world wide world of artificial intelligence

1121
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:08,600
Speaker 15:  streaming through your smart speaker and into the ears of your, through

1122
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:12,200
Speaker 15:  your old toddler. So you know, we kind of need this

1123
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:16,040
Speaker 15:  control mechanism and you know, we need these companies to sort of be able

1124
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:19,960
Speaker 15:  to provide the exact information we want and not go off onto weird

1125
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:23,720
Speaker 15:  tangents. But you know, it's a hard problem to solve. I'm not an

1126
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:27,360
Speaker 15:  AI expert but I'm sure our colleague James Vincent would be able to, would

1127
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:30,760
Speaker 15:  agree with me that, you know, this type of natural

1128
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,720
Speaker 15:  language processing, this type of, you know, being able to adapt to the

1129
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:38,640
Speaker 15:  way we speak to a voice assistant, nailing that down and getting that right

1130
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:42,600
Speaker 15:  is incredibly hard. You know, the simplest things in life are

1131
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:46,560
Speaker 15:  a lot harder to do in technology than it than you would think on the

1132
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:50,320
Speaker 15:  monetization front, which is the other part of his question. You know, there's

1133
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:54,160
Speaker 15:  one of the three that's sort of the prime target here. Amazon's

1134
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:57,640
Speaker 15:  assistant is constantly trying to sell us things. Yes,

1135
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:01,720
Speaker 15:  it's a tricky world. I don't, when you think about what we are getting

1136
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:05,080
Speaker 15:  from a voice assistant, it is kind of surprising that we're not having to

1137
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:08,760
Speaker 15:  pay for it. I mean the functionality that you are getting, you know, it's

1138
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:12,320
Speaker 15:  like, you know, the older dash, I dunno if it's old, but in the tech world,

1139
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:15,680
Speaker 15:  you know, if you are not paying for it then you are the product. So

1140
01:07:15,950 --> 01:07:19,800
Speaker 15:  that's something with Siri and Google assistant,

1141
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:23,640
Speaker 15:  you know, it's a feature of their hardware so it's a feature of the smartphone

1142
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:27,520
Speaker 15:  or the smart speaker and those companies are monetizing in

1143
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:31,360
Speaker 15:  different ways. But with Amazon's, you know, their main monetization

1144
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:35,560
Speaker 15:  strategy is byproducts from us. So we are gonna see more of

1145
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:39,440
Speaker 15:  that. I'm very sure in the future with the voice assistant in

1146
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,120
Speaker 15:  your home. So just be aware when you're picking which one, which one you

1147
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:46,440
Speaker 15:  wanna bring into your home, that that one is the one that's most likely

1148
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:50,560
Speaker 15:  to see more monetization in the future, which already does. So

1149
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:51,040
Speaker 15:  start

1150
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:54,560
Speaker 2:  Trying to sell you stuff. Yep. Well that's one of the reasons I went with

1151
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:58,440
Speaker 2:  Siri honestly is, is is I knew there was a little bit more mindfulness

1152
01:07:58,650 --> 01:08:02,200
Speaker 2:  of privacy and unlikely for me to be

1153
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:06,120
Speaker 2:  monetized in my data to necessarily be monetized. Yeah. Or at least in ways

1154
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,640
Speaker 2:  that are very visible to me.

1155
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:11,240
Speaker 15:  And then on the flip side though, Siri doesn't do as much as

1156
01:08:11,470 --> 01:08:15,400
Speaker 15:  Amazon's or Google's does and that's why Yeah because it doesn't know

1157
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:19,000
Speaker 15:  as much about you because you've chosen that for that reason. So you know,

1158
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:22,560
Speaker 15:  as I said the beginning, the three do things very differently and in different

1159
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:26,240
Speaker 15:  ways and in a way that's good cuz you can choose which one and the

1160
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,520
Speaker 15:  ultimate, you know, in the ideal world will all it, there'll be one that

1161
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,800
Speaker 15:  can do it all. And you know, it was interesting that ces this year

1162
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:36,840
Speaker 15:  Amazon was showing off some integrations using its voice

1163
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:40,680
Speaker 15:  assistant in different places. So it's now you can

1164
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:44,760
Speaker 15:  actually get, or you will be able to have both Amazon's assistant and Apple's

1165
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:48,560
Speaker 15:  as assistant in vehicle infotainment system.

1166
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,440
Speaker 15:  So you can choose which one you talk to. And then they also partnered

1167
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:55,680
Speaker 15:  with Josh ai, which is a really interesting,

1168
01:08:56,190 --> 01:09:00,040
Speaker 15:  entirely local based home voice control system. Oh cool.

1169
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:03,520
Speaker 15:  So that's kind of an interesting partnership because you're getting the

1170
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:07,200
Speaker 15:  local control but then when you want to, you can, you know, reach out to

1171
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:10,720
Speaker 15:  the cloud and you know, get the latest Buffalo Bills sports score or whatever

1172
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:11,640
Speaker 15:  it is that you want, but

1173
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:15,600
Speaker 2:  It runs like natively on your, your home hardware. You don't have

1174
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:15,760
Speaker 2:  to,

1175
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:19,720
Speaker 15:  That's what they were saying. Yeah. So Josh AI has its own little

1176
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:23,120
Speaker 15:  speakers that you kind of can put around your home. And to be clear, Josh

1177
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:26,800
Speaker 15:  AI is, is a very high end, quite an expensive Okay.

1178
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,880
Speaker 15:  System that you would add to a high end. I

1179
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:29,480
Speaker 2:  Got all excited.

1180
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:34,760
Speaker 15:  It may become a little more accessible at some point, but yeah, it, so they

1181
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:38,040
Speaker 15:  have these, I think they're called nano microphones and you can just kind

1182
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:41,800
Speaker 15:  of put them around your home from my understanding was, and I, this

1183
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:45,600
Speaker 15:  isn't out yet, but this is, they were announcing the partnership, my understanding

1184
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,160
Speaker 15:  is that there will be integration. So you can ask the same device

1185
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:53,240
Speaker 15:  for either Josh AI or Amazon's assistant and depending on

1186
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:56,920
Speaker 15:  what you want to, what kind of information you want or what actions you

1187
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:59,880
Speaker 15:  want to take. So there's, there are developments and movements in voice

1188
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:03,480
Speaker 15:  assistance and I think they'll continue to grow and get more

1189
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:07,320
Speaker 15:  useful, but probably also still be something you want to yell at every now

1190
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:07,560
Speaker 15:  and then.

1191
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:14,160
Speaker 15:  And I have been told by engineers at Amazon that they do pay attention

1192
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:16,000
Speaker 15:  when you swear at it.

1193
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:17,840
Speaker 2:  Oh no, that's very bad for

1194
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,960
Speaker 15:  Me. It's registered as a negative customer feedback.

1195
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:26,960
Speaker 2:  Oh boy. Well I am gonna have to go apologize

1196
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:31,040
Speaker 2:  to all my voice assistants now, so thank you
