Description: Nilay, Alex, and David talk about what's happening on social media — and around the web — in the wake of the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. Then they talk about their early impression of Apple's public betas, from the redesigned homescreens to the iPad's fancy new math abilities. After that, it's time for a bunch of gadgets all asking the same idea: is this anything? Then it's off to the lightning round, filled with 4K streams and leaky infinity pools.


2
00:01:14,255 --> 00:01:17,695
Speaker 5:  lightning round what I want and I put my name next to it in bold with great

3
00:01:18,055 --> 00:01:21,855
Speaker 5:  enthusiasm. and it is one of those things, I love a thing that's a metaphor

4
00:01:21,955 --> 00:01:25,855
Speaker 5:  for something. Yeah. But you don't know what, but it is for sure a metaphor.

5
00:01:26,365 --> 00:01:28,655
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Like a vibe's a four. Yeah.

6
00:01:29,635 --> 00:01:31,255
Speaker 5:  That's really good. Yeah, that's, that's right.

7
00:01:31,685 --> 00:01:34,735
Speaker 3:  It's just like, oh, this story is the correct vibe for the, this moment of

8
00:01:34,735 --> 00:01:35,895
Speaker 3:  America. Yeah. Alex Kranz is here.

9
00:01:36,205 --> 00:01:39,975
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I I, I don't own a house, but if I did, it wouldn't be that one for

10
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:40,855
Speaker 4:  a variety of reasons.

11
00:01:42,595 --> 00:01:45,295
Speaker 3:  All right. There's a lot of talk about the Apple betas came out this week.

12
00:01:45,345 --> 00:01:49,015
Speaker 3:  We've got a, what David is calling an, is this anything gadget bonanza,

13
00:01:49,355 --> 00:01:53,175
Speaker 3:  and then we got the lightning round unsponsored. Mm. At this point,

14
00:01:53,175 --> 00:01:55,615
Speaker 3:  someone should start a company called Unsponsored. Just putting that out.

15
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:55,895
Speaker 3:  Yeah,

16
00:01:55,895 --> 00:01:56,335
Speaker 5:  That's pretty good.

17
00:01:56,595 --> 00:01:59,655
Speaker 3:  But we should start with what is arguably the biggest story in the world,

18
00:02:00,345 --> 00:02:04,335
Speaker 3:  which is the attempted assassination of Donald Trump and then

19
00:02:04,335 --> 00:02:08,175
Speaker 3:  the RNC in which Trump was nominated and announced JD Vance as

20
00:02:08,355 --> 00:02:11,775
Speaker 3:  his running mate. The is the vice presidential nominee, and I wanna spend

21
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:15,015
Speaker 3:  a lot of time on this. It feels important to talk about. It is the biggest

22
00:02:15,015 --> 00:02:18,815
Speaker 3:  story in the world, and there are lots of VERGE stories in this story. For

23
00:02:18,815 --> 00:02:22,695
Speaker 3:  example, I think as we learn more about the would be assassin who

24
00:02:22,695 --> 00:02:26,455
Speaker 3:  was 20 years old. It feels likely it is digital footprint will reveal a bunch,

25
00:02:26,455 --> 00:02:29,975
Speaker 3:  and that means things like hacking his phone were immediately important.

26
00:02:30,905 --> 00:02:33,975
Speaker 3:  We've talked a lot about cops trying to hack phones on the show and on The

27
00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:37,775
Speaker 3:  Verge over the years, and they got into it almost immediately. And

28
00:02:37,775 --> 00:02:40,615
Speaker 3:  that's because they've just gotten good at it. The FBI isn't running to Apple

29
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:43,855
Speaker 3:  to ask them to break the phone open. So there's that sort of stuff happening

30
00:02:43,855 --> 00:02:47,575
Speaker 3:  as that investigation goes forward, more

31
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:51,215
Speaker 3:  immediately important in the context of The Verge and The Verge has,

32
00:02:51,835 --> 00:02:55,575
Speaker 3:  is what happened to the social networks afterwards. We've talked a lot about

33
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:59,240
Speaker 3:  content moderation on the show and whether or not social networks have have

34
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,965
Speaker 3:  a duty to the truth. Mark Zuckerberg has famously said he doesn't want to

35
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:06,485
Speaker 3:  be the arbiter of truth and set up a weird fake Supreme court for content

36
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:10,325
Speaker 3:  moderation on Facebook platforms. We are at a place now

37
00:03:10,335 --> 00:03:13,845
Speaker 3:  where they appear to have given up. Right. Like

38
00:03:14,305 --> 00:03:17,805
Speaker 3:  you would put COVID. It's sort of the high point of content

39
00:03:17,975 --> 00:03:21,605
Speaker 3:  moderation, controversies and discussion and interest

40
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,005
Speaker 3:  from the platforms.

41
00:03:23,175 --> 00:03:26,725
Speaker 5:  Maybe not in terms of success, but certainly in terms of volume. Yeah.

42
00:03:27,235 --> 00:03:30,925
Speaker 5:  Like it was, it was the moment everyone was most aggressively like on it

43
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:32,085
Speaker 5:  one way or another. Yeah.

44
00:03:32,785 --> 00:03:36,165
Speaker 3:  And whether, you know, like are you gonna amplify conspiracy theories? And

45
00:03:36,575 --> 00:03:40,205
Speaker 3:  there was just a lot there that has resulted in major

46
00:03:40,245 --> 00:03:42,925
Speaker 3:  lawsuits. And one of them just hit the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court

47
00:03:42,925 --> 00:03:46,205
Speaker 3:  said no, the government's allowed to talk to the social networks. Like

48
00:03:47,065 --> 00:03:50,525
Speaker 3:  all of that had happened, and it feels like it's in the past and

49
00:03:50,895 --> 00:03:54,605
Speaker 3:  we've been sort of talking about it, but then the

50
00:03:55,005 --> 00:03:58,525
Speaker 3:  shooting happened and you just saw in real time

51
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:02,605
Speaker 3:  the social networks, Twitter X, whatever it's called

52
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:06,405
Speaker 3:  threads. They were good at it for one second.

53
00:04:07,275 --> 00:04:11,085
Speaker 3:  They were like, this thing happened and here's video of it,

54
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:14,445
Speaker 3:  and here's some photos of it, and here's everyone just reacting to it for

55
00:04:14,475 --> 00:04:18,445
Speaker 3:  like one second. You could verify that a thing had happened and they

56
00:04:18,445 --> 00:04:22,285
Speaker 3:  were ahead of the major news networks, which are very, very cautious in

57
00:04:22,405 --> 00:04:26,085
Speaker 3:  breaking news events like that. So if you just wanted a shot of pure

58
00:04:26,085 --> 00:04:27,325
Speaker 3:  adrenaline, they would give it to you.

59
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:31,405
Speaker 5:  Well, and this was actually an, an unusually perfect case in

60
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:35,245
Speaker 5:  that sense because you had a, a televised event, right? Like

61
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:39,205
Speaker 5:  the, he's, he's on stage talking as all of this is happening. Like

62
00:04:39,465 --> 00:04:43,325
Speaker 5:  the person this is happening to is right there in front of a camera. You

63
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:47,205
Speaker 5:  have what turned out to be some like truly historic photographers out there

64
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:50,885
Speaker 5:  working, taking shots that ended up being really important really quickly.

65
00:04:50,885 --> 00:04:54,685
Speaker 5:  And that stuff gets uploaded faster than ever. So we had this like primary

66
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:58,765
Speaker 5:  source material faster and more sort

67
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:02,445
Speaker 5:  of remarkably than almost anything I can ever remember. Like

68
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:06,325
Speaker 5:  the speed with which, what you would call, like the photo of the things

69
00:05:06,325 --> 00:05:10,125
Speaker 5:  started. Yeah. Floating around the internet was just unbelievable to me.

70
00:05:10,305 --> 00:05:11,685
Speaker 5:  It was like seconds. Yeah.

71
00:05:11,905 --> 00:05:15,125
Speaker 3:  And it just wa was there, and then you saw this sort of like weird,

72
00:05:16,285 --> 00:05:20,085
Speaker 3:  everyone quoting the like CNN or New York Times headline that was more cautious

73
00:05:20,595 --> 00:05:23,245
Speaker 3:  than the rush to judgment on the social networks and be like, why? This is

74
00:05:23,245 --> 00:05:27,005
Speaker 3:  like, it's like the big networks are cautious. The the rigor

75
00:05:27,265 --> 00:05:31,045
Speaker 3:  is the point. And like there's a gap here. And that gap

76
00:05:31,145 --> 00:05:35,045
Speaker 3:  has only gotten wider, which is utterly fascinating to me.

77
00:05:35,045 --> 00:05:38,045
Speaker 3:  There's no attempt to moderate

78
00:05:38,645 --> 00:05:42,605
Speaker 3:  pictures of a shooting like a guy got shot and there's pictures

79
00:05:42,605 --> 00:05:46,405
Speaker 3:  of it everywhere and there's no attempt to moderate it. On top of that,

80
00:05:46,855 --> 00:05:50,725
Speaker 3:  there is just, I mean, an, an explosion of

81
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:54,565
Speaker 3:  conspiracy theories from everyone. E everyone

82
00:05:54,565 --> 00:05:57,605
Speaker 3:  is a conspiracy theorist right now, and they're all just like flooding onto

83
00:05:57,605 --> 00:06:01,485
Speaker 3:  these platforms, particularly X and there's no

84
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:04,885
Speaker 3:  attempt to slow it down or fact check it or anything like that. And You can

85
00:06:04,885 --> 00:06:08,565
Speaker 3:  just see like, oh, the, the knob got turned. We're just not doing content

86
00:06:08,565 --> 00:06:11,525
Speaker 3:  moderation anymore. Like we, we don't care about this. We're gonna do the

87
00:06:11,525 --> 00:06:15,325
Speaker 3:  really bad stuff. You, you talk to people who are still working in the industry,

88
00:06:16,015 --> 00:06:19,685
Speaker 3:  right? They're gonna continue to not, they're gonna continue working

89
00:06:19,915 --> 00:06:23,805
Speaker 3:  against child sexual abuse material or just like

90
00:06:23,805 --> 00:06:26,925
Speaker 3:  abject pornography and platforms that aren't supposed to have it. They will

91
00:06:26,925 --> 00:06:30,885
Speaker 3:  all for, for forever and ever. Copyright infringement will

92
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:34,765
Speaker 3:  be a thing that the platforms care about, but this, they're just

93
00:06:34,765 --> 00:06:38,245
Speaker 3:  like over it, right? The idea that harmful information can spread on social

94
00:06:38,245 --> 00:06:41,325
Speaker 3:  networks and that the platforms of any responsibility,

95
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:46,365
Speaker 3:  it's gone. It, and it, it, i I think this one's a marker. Like, it feels

96
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:49,205
Speaker 3:  like a real marker to me that that's where the information environment is

97
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:52,885
Speaker 3:  now. And for all the other stuff we talk about, like AI or sludge or

98
00:06:52,915 --> 00:06:56,405
Speaker 3:  fake photos. Yeah. It all happened immediately.

99
00:06:56,755 --> 00:07:00,485
Speaker 3:  Yeah. After this event and nothing happened.

100
00:07:01,185 --> 00:07:04,925
Speaker 5:  You know what I think a lot about in these events now is the, the sort of

101
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:09,005
Speaker 5:  public turn Mark Zuckerberg made over the last several years where

102
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:13,285
Speaker 5:  he went from being the guy who was talking really earnestly about

103
00:07:13,305 --> 00:07:17,125
Speaker 5:  how hard meta and Facebook in particular was trying with content

104
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:21,045
Speaker 5:  moderation and saying things true things. Like, the

105
00:07:21,045 --> 00:07:24,045
Speaker 5:  reason we get so much crap for this is because we're the ones trying the

106
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:26,605
Speaker 5:  hardest and the most transparently. Like, I think that's basically true.

107
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:30,965
Speaker 5:  And he even, he eventually was just like, you know what? This is actually

108
00:07:30,965 --> 00:07:33,645
Speaker 5:  not worth it. Like, all I'm doing is signing myself up to get yelled at.

109
00:07:33,705 --> 00:07:37,685
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna go back to posting about new WhatsApp features and

110
00:07:37,685 --> 00:07:40,245
Speaker 5:  cool stuff in the Metaverse, and I'm gonna go back to being the product guy

111
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,885
Speaker 5:  and Nick Clegg, who nobody cares about, gets to be the one who talks about

112
00:07:43,885 --> 00:07:47,205
Speaker 5:  content moderation. And I think that is, to me, is so indicative of

113
00:07:47,905 --> 00:07:51,765
Speaker 5:  how we've gotten to this place of like, it's somewhere

114
00:07:51,765 --> 00:07:55,725
Speaker 5:  between like resignation and nihilism where there is a sense that

115
00:07:56,515 --> 00:07:59,845
Speaker 5:  this isn't going to get better, so why even try

116
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:04,205
Speaker 5:  and what does better even look like? Because no one agrees on what it's supposed

117
00:08:04,205 --> 00:08:07,925
Speaker 5:  to be anymore. So it just feels like at some point the only like rational

118
00:08:07,925 --> 00:08:10,765
Speaker 5:  thing to do is just throw up your hands and be like, you know, whatever you

119
00:08:10,765 --> 00:08:13,565
Speaker 5:  guys do whatever you want, I'm out. Yeah. and it really, really feels like

120
00:08:13,565 --> 00:08:14,525
Speaker 5:  that's where everyone has landed.

121
00:08:14,755 --> 00:08:18,205
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's a value proposition, right? Like there, there is no value in,

122
00:08:18,305 --> 00:08:22,245
Speaker 4:  in content moderation for at this point. And in maintaining that

123
00:08:22,245 --> 00:08:25,765
Speaker 4:  theater of content moderation, the value has, has just vastly

124
00:08:26,365 --> 00:08:28,965
Speaker 4:  diminished over the last few years. So it's like, okay, I don't need to do

125
00:08:28,965 --> 00:08:31,845
Speaker 4:  it anymore. I can move on to other stuff. And we've seen that in a lot of

126
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,885
Speaker 4:  things, a lot of these kind of theatrical moments, particularly in Big Tech

127
00:08:34,885 --> 00:08:37,925
Speaker 4:  where they're like, oh yeah, we, we, you know, we care about being good.

128
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:41,005
Speaker 4:  We care about doing all these things. They no longer have to, they realized

129
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:44,165
Speaker 4:  that actually doesn't net them as much as they need it. They thought it would.

130
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:46,525
Speaker 4:  And so they've just kind of said, nah, nevermind.

131
00:08:46,915 --> 00:08:49,605
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It's just fascinating to me because, you know, the immediate reaction

132
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:53,125
Speaker 3:  from everyone is like, tone down the rhetoric, be good to each other. We're

133
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:56,845
Speaker 3:  all Americans. And then a day later, all of the social

134
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:00,005
Speaker 3:  platforms are flooded with conspiracy theories.

135
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:04,885
Speaker 3:  My favorite one is the shooter was in a video that

136
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:08,205
Speaker 3:  was an ad for BlackRock, which is a private equity company that is an, an

137
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:12,285
Speaker 3:  investor in like gun companies. And they did something at a school

138
00:09:12,305 --> 00:09:14,765
Speaker 3:  and he was like in the background of the video that they did about the teacher

139
00:09:14,785 --> 00:09:18,645
Speaker 3:  at the school. And so now there's a BlackRock conspiracy theory. Okay. And

140
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:22,485
Speaker 3:  it's like, even that is like fine,

141
00:09:22,555 --> 00:09:25,085
Speaker 3:  fine, fine. You should be able to post that to social media. Like whatever.

142
00:09:25,085 --> 00:09:28,605
Speaker 3:  You wanna have some wackadoo like idea. But you look at

143
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:32,605
Speaker 3:  Twitter and it's like, because of the volume and because Twitter

144
00:09:32,665 --> 00:09:36,325
Speaker 3:  has driven away so many otherwise sane people or X has driven away so many

145
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,965
Speaker 3:  other, it's not just like sort of conventional wisdom, right? And it's like,

146
00:09:39,965 --> 00:09:42,645
Speaker 3:  oh, this is the stuff that actually poisons the discourse. Right? This is

147
00:09:42,645 --> 00:09:45,925
Speaker 3:  a thing that actually makes it harder to bring people together and actually

148
00:09:45,925 --> 00:09:49,805
Speaker 3:  creates the social division. And the platforms have basically given up. You

149
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:52,245
Speaker 3:  can see it on TikTok too in a very different way, right? It's just people

150
00:09:52,245 --> 00:09:56,045
Speaker 3:  yelling at each other all day about this and like insisting that one

151
00:09:56,045 --> 00:09:58,485
Speaker 3:  side or the other has it for each other. And the platforms have basically

152
00:09:58,485 --> 00:10:02,365
Speaker 3:  given up trying to stop it. And I, there's it's election

153
00:10:02,365 --> 00:10:06,045
Speaker 3:  year, it's bound to be polarized. But that's, to me, that's the big VERGE

154
00:10:06,045 --> 00:10:09,765
Speaker 3:  story here is there was a moment several years ago when the

155
00:10:09,965 --> 00:10:13,685
Speaker 3:  platforms really wanted to, to like create healthy

156
00:10:13,685 --> 00:10:17,525
Speaker 3:  conversations that was Twitter's metric and now they're over it,

157
00:10:17,905 --> 00:10:21,765
Speaker 3:  you know? And like meta is like threads is a place for conversations. And

158
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:26,245
Speaker 3:  what that amounts to is people just asking questions

159
00:10:26,245 --> 00:10:28,805
Speaker 3:  where they appear to be idiots so people will yell at them for engagement

160
00:10:28,825 --> 00:10:32,645
Speaker 3:  all day long. Yep. Like everyone's like people on like you open threads and

161
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:36,125
Speaker 3:  like every third post is someone's like, I just took a bite of an orange

162
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:39,365
Speaker 3:  without taking the peel off. Did you know that that's bad? And it's like,

163
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:39,925
Speaker 3:  what the fuck?

164
00:10:42,555 --> 00:10:44,525
Speaker 3:  Like truly, what are you talking about?

165
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:49,325
Speaker 5:  I, I posted on threads the other day that Amazon is a terrible website because

166
00:10:49,345 --> 00:10:52,885
Speaker 5:  Amazon is a terrible website and I had a bunch of people accuse me of engagement

167
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,325
Speaker 5:  bait for it, which I really enjoyed. Yeah. It's the first time in a while

168
00:10:55,325 --> 00:10:57,525
Speaker 5:  I've been accused of engagement bait and it, it made me very happy.

169
00:10:57,525 --> 00:11:00,645
Speaker 3:  Threads is the first platform that has completely incentivized people from

170
00:11:00,645 --> 00:11:04,445
Speaker 3:  asking questions because you, no matter what, you seem like

171
00:11:04,485 --> 00:11:06,645
Speaker 3:  you're Jason clout. It's very good.

172
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,805
Speaker 5:  It's good stuff. But no, I think to your, to your point about the like

173
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:14,645
Speaker 5:  matching all of that sort of giving up on content

174
00:11:14,645 --> 00:11:18,485
Speaker 5:  moderation with the fact that what, like the FBI

175
00:11:18,485 --> 00:11:22,165
Speaker 5:  does immediately is try to get into the shooter's phone is like,

176
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:26,605
Speaker 5:  it, it's, it's both getting worse and higher stakes all the

177
00:11:26,605 --> 00:11:28,925
Speaker 5:  time, right? Yeah. And so much of what we've been seeing over the last few

178
00:11:28,925 --> 00:11:32,885
Speaker 5:  days is like Discord released a statement that

179
00:11:32,885 --> 00:11:36,245
Speaker 5:  the shooter had a Discord account like that that is news

180
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:40,165
Speaker 5:  that he was on Discord. And there there's been this weird back and forth

181
00:11:40,305 --> 00:11:42,885
Speaker 5:  on whether there was some kind of like,

182
00:11:44,345 --> 00:11:48,045
Speaker 5:  not manifesto, but like hint as to what was coming on a Steam account that

183
00:11:48,045 --> 00:11:50,725
Speaker 5:  seems like it was and it wasn't some, and so we're in this place where it's

184
00:11:50,725 --> 00:11:54,405
Speaker 5:  like this stuff matters more than ever as they try to figure out what

185
00:11:54,605 --> 00:11:58,445
Speaker 5:  happened. And yet the ability to figure out what is actually going

186
00:11:58,465 --> 00:12:00,845
Speaker 5:  on feels like it's getting further and further away from us.

187
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:05,245
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And especially if you're just a normal person who's just opening

188
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:08,845
Speaker 3:  an app on their phone, right? Yeah. So that's that We're gonna cover a lot

189
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:12,805
Speaker 3:  of that. It, it seems important. I'll give, I'll give you one

190
00:12:12,805 --> 00:12:16,565
Speaker 3:  other example, which is just a very new example. These photos that we're

191
00:12:16,565 --> 00:12:19,805
Speaker 3:  all talking about, those photos were taken by professional photographers

192
00:12:20,065 --> 00:12:23,965
Speaker 3:  who were in the pit to get paid to do a job with very expensive cameras.

193
00:12:24,265 --> 00:12:26,725
Speaker 3:  People have argue, started arguing with the settings of the cameras, by the

194
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:30,485
Speaker 3:  way, which is very nerdy I thing to do online. Those

195
00:12:30,485 --> 00:12:33,605
Speaker 3:  photos are owned. They have, you know, they're copyrighted image images.

196
00:12:33,905 --> 00:12:35,965
Speaker 3:  One of them is owned by the New York Times. I think the other one's owned

197
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:39,525
Speaker 3:  by the, the ap. They're everywhere. They're just straight

198
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,125
Speaker 3:  copyright infringement. All the merch. You're seeing the hats with the photos

199
00:12:42,145 --> 00:12:46,005
Speaker 3:  on them. It's a straightforward copyright infringement. The photo

200
00:12:46,325 --> 00:12:49,605
Speaker 3:  agencies and the Times and all those other companies, they're gonna have

201
00:12:49,605 --> 00:12:52,845
Speaker 3:  to issue a bunch of take downs. It, we, we went out and asked them

202
00:12:53,385 --> 00:12:57,085
Speaker 3:  and basically all of them were like, we are evaluating our options. Weird,

203
00:12:58,055 --> 00:13:01,485
Speaker 3:  weird. Like that photo feels like it immediately belongs to the world, right?

204
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:03,565
Speaker 3:  but it super doesn't Well, and

205
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:07,405
Speaker 5:  In part it feels that way because all of these other machines moves so much

206
00:13:07,405 --> 00:13:11,005
Speaker 5:  faster than the lawyers for those news organizations, right? Like

207
00:13:11,585 --> 00:13:15,565
Speaker 5:  the, the Etsy's popular page was filled with

208
00:13:15,565 --> 00:13:18,645
Speaker 5:  that kind of merch that you're talking about. Yeah. Like Amazon has a thing

209
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:21,845
Speaker 5:  that You can print on demand. Like literally all you have to do is upload

210
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:25,565
Speaker 5:  a photo to Amazon and boom, you're selling merch. Like, it,

211
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:29,685
Speaker 5:  it is crazy how quick, how quickly that stuff is able to happen now.

212
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:33,605
Speaker 5:  And it's happening faster in every other part of the system

213
00:13:34,195 --> 00:13:37,645
Speaker 5:  than like within these organizations that are actually trying to figure out

214
00:13:37,645 --> 00:13:40,365
Speaker 5:  what to do about it. And so they all figure, you know, I'm gonna go, I'm

215
00:13:40,365 --> 00:13:42,805
Speaker 5:  gonna make my money. I'm gonna sell my T-shirts and I'm gonna get out before

216
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,805
Speaker 5:  anybody else has even like figured out what their first move is.

217
00:13:45,805 --> 00:13:48,525
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And I would just wrap this up. We spent a lot of time talking to AI

218
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:52,205
Speaker 3:  and boy do I get the emails when we talk about AI and hint even a little

219
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:55,685
Speaker 3:  bit that AI might be useful or interesting, right? That it's stealing work.

220
00:13:55,685 --> 00:13:59,445
Speaker 3:  That it's stealing creativity. If you have those feelings about the AI companies

221
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,485
Speaker 3:  and You can and should, I don't, I won't stop you.

222
00:14:03,905 --> 00:14:07,645
Speaker 3:  How do you feel about someone whose job it is to stand in a place where you

223
00:14:07,645 --> 00:14:11,485
Speaker 3:  might get shot at, take some of the most historic photos in the world and

224
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:15,085
Speaker 3:  immediately watch that stuff get stolen by very opportunistic

225
00:14:15,615 --> 00:14:19,525
Speaker 3:  merch vendors on Amazon. Is that bad? Like May,

226
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,365
Speaker 3:  maybe, but I don't think anybody has the same immediate reaction to

227
00:14:23,365 --> 00:14:27,325
Speaker 3:  it the way that I know they do. We talk about opening ai totally. Like

228
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,045
Speaker 3:  there's something there that's weird. We, we spend a lot of time talking

229
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:32,525
Speaker 3:  about how copy law is the only functional regulation in the internet. 'cause

230
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:36,165
Speaker 3:  it's effectively a speech regulation and you're about to see it

231
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:40,085
Speaker 3:  used as in a way that feels very much like a speech regulation.

232
00:14:40,665 --> 00:14:44,325
Speaker 3:  You wanna sell a hat with this photo on it. Some photo agency is gonna come

233
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:48,205
Speaker 3:  and tell you that you can't. And like we reckoning

234
00:14:48,205 --> 00:14:52,085
Speaker 3:  with that is it's right next to the content moderation question.

235
00:14:52,485 --> 00:14:54,365
Speaker 3:  'cause a lot of people are gonna lose their minds 'cause they feel like that

236
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:57,645
Speaker 3:  photo belongs to the world or those photos belong to the world. Anyway, lots

237
00:14:57,645 --> 00:15:01,165
Speaker 3:  of urge stories there. I'm confident we co you remember the Shepherd

238
00:15:01,295 --> 00:15:05,085
Speaker 3:  fairy picture of Obama? We covered the copyright case around that

239
00:15:05,085 --> 00:15:08,885
Speaker 3:  photo of Obama for like 10 years and we we did a story and it like six

240
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:12,605
Speaker 3:  months ago, it's gonna be that again. Yeah, right. Just like what does it

241
00:15:12,605 --> 00:15:16,565
Speaker 3:  mean for these images to exist on the internet in the way they do? And

242
00:15:16,565 --> 00:15:19,565
Speaker 3:  who gets to, who gets to make money on them? It's like kind of one question.

243
00:15:19,865 --> 00:15:23,005
Speaker 3:  And the second question is like, that is content moderation and the content

244
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,965
Speaker 3:  moderation apparatus of our information environment is, it's in a,

245
00:15:27,405 --> 00:15:30,805
Speaker 3:  I think as Alex was saying, like in a pretty nihilistic space. Yeah.

246
00:15:31,315 --> 00:15:35,285
Speaker 3:  Like, like you have to make sure there's not the worst thing. You

247
00:15:35,285 --> 00:15:39,245
Speaker 3:  clear that bar. It's like a free for all. Yep. All right. So

248
00:15:39,245 --> 00:15:43,005
Speaker 3:  that is that event. Immediately thereafter, there was a

249
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,685
Speaker 3:  Republican national convention this week. It was not a quiet week for politic

250
00:15:46,765 --> 00:15:50,325
Speaker 3:  politics in America. President Biden has covid. It's like chill times all

251
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,125
Speaker 3:  around. Yeah.

252
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:57,045
Speaker 3:  Not a quiet week by any means. My instruction, the only news on the RC that's

253
00:15:57,045 --> 00:16:00,885
Speaker 3:  worth talking about is Trump picked JD Vance, who's center from Ohio is his

254
00:16:01,565 --> 00:16:05,485
Speaker 3:  running mate, his vice presidential nominee. And then a million people

255
00:16:06,505 --> 00:16:10,445
Speaker 3:  in tech came out in support of Trump. Elon Musk,

256
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:14,525
Speaker 3:  the Andreessen Horowitz partners, mark Andreessen, Ben Horowitz, just like

257
00:16:14,525 --> 00:16:18,325
Speaker 3:  down every crypto bro You can think of is pro-Trump. They love JD

258
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:22,045
Speaker 3:  Vance, who was a venture capitalist, took a lot of money from Peter

259
00:16:22,045 --> 00:16:25,645
Speaker 3:  Thiel over the years. There's just a reactionary right wing

260
00:16:25,745 --> 00:16:26,845
Speaker 3:  crypto bro

261
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:32,365
Speaker 3:  situation there. There it is. We will cover it

262
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:34,805
Speaker 3:  more. I don't, we don't wanna talk about, about it in the Vergecast. Now

263
00:16:34,805 --> 00:16:38,325
Speaker 3:  I wanna make sure we do some like reporting on it. Yeah. But JD Vance is

264
00:16:38,325 --> 00:16:42,085
Speaker 3:  a really interesting character. And I, I don't mean that in the, like

265
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:47,445
Speaker 3:  you should read his book, which is bad. I mean that in the, it's

266
00:16:47,445 --> 00:16:51,045
Speaker 3:  it's, it's not good. And the movie's worse. I mean that in the,

267
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,725
Speaker 3:  the malleability of his positions is really interesting. His relationship

268
00:16:54,865 --> 00:16:57,805
Speaker 3:  to the power of Big Tech is

269
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:02,645
Speaker 3:  interesting. He was just at a conference that r and Lauren Finer was at

270
00:17:02,665 --> 00:17:05,885
Speaker 3:  called Remedy Fest, where he said, I think Lena Kahn's doing a good job.

271
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:09,285
Speaker 3:  Why does he think Lena Kahn's doing a good job? Because he thinks they should

272
00:17:09,285 --> 00:17:12,965
Speaker 3:  break up Google. Why does he wanna break up Google so he can push weird right

273
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:16,845
Speaker 3:  wing conspiracies on the internet. Like you, it, you start at, oh, we agree,

274
00:17:16,865 --> 00:17:20,565
Speaker 3:  and then you like drill down and it's like, oh, the,

275
00:17:20,945 --> 00:17:24,805
Speaker 3:  the flow of information is not going the way that some of these people

276
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:28,605
Speaker 3:  want. So we will use the power of the state to like

277
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:32,005
Speaker 3:  break these companies up. And then you just like end up in this is like total

278
00:17:32,005 --> 00:17:35,485
Speaker 3:  horseshoe theory, strange bedfellows moment. So we're gonna cover a lot of

279
00:17:35,485 --> 00:17:39,325
Speaker 3:  that. I just warning the listener like it's

280
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:43,245
Speaker 3:  coming because it's so, it's so much, there's so much weird

281
00:17:43,315 --> 00:17:46,725
Speaker 3:  Mark Andreessen Peter Thiel crypto tech money

282
00:17:47,465 --> 00:17:51,405
Speaker 3:  now involved in this presidential election that it's impossible

283
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:52,085
Speaker 3:  for us not to cover

284
00:17:52,085 --> 00:17:54,805
Speaker 4:  It. Yeah. Because Peter Thiel famously stayed out of the last one, right?

285
00:17:55,645 --> 00:17:57,605
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Well I mean he said he was

286
00:17:58,185 --> 00:17:59,325
Speaker 4:  He said he would. Yeah. Yeah.

287
00:17:59,555 --> 00:18:03,485
Speaker 3:  It's outta control. All right. I just, you know,

288
00:18:03,585 --> 00:18:06,885
Speaker 3:  I'm like a cranky gen Xer You can imagine how I feel about this entire situation,

289
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,085
Speaker 3:  but here it is. Anyway, iOS 18 betas,

290
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,325
Speaker 4:  They're out. They're here. They're out.

291
00:18:11,545 --> 00:18:11,765
Speaker 3:  No,

292
00:18:11,995 --> 00:18:15,645
Speaker 4:  David's been checking a bunch of them out. Like David, you, you risked your

293
00:18:15,645 --> 00:18:18,125
Speaker 4:  phone. You, you took the hit for the rest of us. Yeah,

294
00:18:18,245 --> 00:18:22,205
Speaker 5:  I started with the iPad because I was like, that's safe. It's just

295
00:18:22,205 --> 00:18:25,765
Speaker 5:  an iPad. I have thousands of them what could possibly go wrong?

296
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,925
Speaker 5:  And now somehow I'm running iPad OS 18 iOS 18

297
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:34,485
Speaker 5:  macOS Sequoia and the new TV o s

298
00:18:34,485 --> 00:18:38,365
Speaker 5:  like how is what, how is this my life? Everything is broken. My batteries

299
00:18:38,395 --> 00:18:42,205
Speaker 5:  have just absolutely gone to hell. But I get to use the cool new stuff.

300
00:18:42,475 --> 00:18:46,085
Speaker 5:  It's, it's fine. It's a trade. Yeah. I'll say the single

301
00:18:46,635 --> 00:18:50,405
Speaker 5:  most important thing that has happened to me in my technology life this year,

302
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:53,805
Speaker 5:  I'm not exaggerating, is having RCS on the iPhone.

303
00:18:54,595 --> 00:18:56,125
Speaker 4:  Well, it's like saving your marriage, right?

304
00:18:56,275 --> 00:19:00,045
Speaker 5:  Like, like literally my, my wife uses an Android

305
00:19:00,045 --> 00:19:01,765
Speaker 5:  phone. She's a pixel row for life.

306
00:19:03,305 --> 00:19:07,285
Speaker 5:  And steadfastly refuses to understand that

307
00:19:07,285 --> 00:19:11,165
Speaker 5:  when she sends me a video, it, it looks like a potato every

308
00:19:11,165 --> 00:19:14,285
Speaker 5:  single time. So like what will happen is the, the woman who runs our daycare

309
00:19:14,435 --> 00:19:18,285
Speaker 5:  will send Anna a adorable video of my child and Anna will forward it to me.

310
00:19:18,285 --> 00:19:21,885
Speaker 5:  And I literally can't see it because it just, it's just eight

311
00:19:21,985 --> 00:19:25,405
Speaker 5:  pixels stacked that sort of looks like blonde hair. Like that's just all,

312
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:29,365
Speaker 5:  it's Yeah. But now I have RCS, the photos are

313
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:33,245
Speaker 5:  big, the videos are big, like it works correctly. I, I don't have to like

314
00:19:33,275 --> 00:19:37,205
Speaker 5:  make every make her send me Google photos links anymore. It's the best.

315
00:19:37,505 --> 00:19:41,365
Speaker 5:  And it's like a little wonky and it falls back to SMS too often. It's

316
00:19:41,365 --> 00:19:44,525
Speaker 5:  getting better as time goes on. I think like the networks and the carriers

317
00:19:44,525 --> 00:19:48,005
Speaker 5:  are all kind of figuring it out. But RCS on, on

318
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:51,925
Speaker 5:  iPhone like huge win. Yeah. And to all the people who have been

319
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:55,565
Speaker 5:  in my mentions telling me like, oh, you silly Americans, we all use

320
00:19:55,845 --> 00:19:58,925
Speaker 5:  WhatsApp. First of all, congratulations. Like, I don't know what to tell

321
00:19:58,925 --> 00:20:02,325
Speaker 5:  you. Great job. Second of all, making people switch messaging apps is

322
00:20:02,325 --> 00:20:06,125
Speaker 5:  impossible. Yeah. It's just, I don't care what messaging app you use, try

323
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,085
Speaker 5:  your best to get all your friends and family to use a different one. Just,

324
00:20:09,115 --> 00:20:13,005
Speaker 5:  just try best of luck. It's not gonna work no matter what it is that you

325
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:16,885
Speaker 5:  use. And so for us here in the good old

326
00:20:17,165 --> 00:20:20,925
Speaker 5:  US of A, we're stuck with text messaging. So anything that makes text

327
00:20:20,925 --> 00:20:23,525
Speaker 5:  messaging slightly better, humongous victory.

328
00:20:24,865 --> 00:20:28,365
Speaker 3:  I'm excited for this to roll out wide and for people to,

329
00:20:30,865 --> 00:20:34,405
Speaker 3:  how do I put this? I'm excited to see if when RCS rolls out wide with iOS

330
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:37,725
Speaker 3:  18, if the green bubble stigma reduces. Yeah,

331
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:41,565
Speaker 5:  I actually think it's going to, I really do. You I do because the, the, the

332
00:20:41,635 --> 00:20:45,405
Speaker 5:  main things that it improves are, what I

333
00:20:45,405 --> 00:20:48,805
Speaker 5:  haven't done is, is like really stress test group chats with this. So I,

334
00:20:48,805 --> 00:20:51,845
Speaker 5:  that is like the main problem, right? So I'll have to see how that does.

335
00:20:51,945 --> 00:20:55,845
Speaker 5:  But the ability to get read receipts

336
00:20:55,985 --> 00:20:59,925
Speaker 5:  and the ability to send high res images and videos and

337
00:20:59,945 --> 00:21:02,805
Speaker 5:  the typing indicators, those are like the three things that immediately

338
00:21:04,065 --> 00:21:07,845
Speaker 5:  my messaging system with my wife got better. Also, the tap

339
00:21:07,855 --> 00:21:11,805
Speaker 5:  backs work a little better, but now that You can use any emoji, it's still

340
00:21:11,805 --> 00:21:15,725
Speaker 5:  kind of wonky on the Android side because if you'd use one that it

341
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:19,445
Speaker 5:  doesn't recognize it just punts it through as a text message. But I,

342
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,085
Speaker 5:  it's like, it's not all the way better. And there's all the new iMessage

343
00:21:22,085 --> 00:21:25,445
Speaker 5:  stuff, the like animations and the text decorations and all that that You

344
00:21:25,445 --> 00:21:29,405
Speaker 5:  can do that you still can't do in Android. But it's much closer. And

345
00:21:29,405 --> 00:21:31,525
Speaker 5:  I think it's like, it's not gonna get all the way better, but I think it's

346
00:21:31,525 --> 00:21:32,245
Speaker 5:  gonna get a little better.

347
00:21:32,865 --> 00:21:36,325
Speaker 3:  Is this gonna work in messages on a Mac?

348
00:21:37,425 --> 00:21:41,365
Speaker 5:  Yes. I have been RC sing from my Mac, but only because it

349
00:21:41,365 --> 00:21:43,485
Speaker 5:  linked to your phone's just forwarding to your phone. Does it,

350
00:21:43,665 --> 00:21:47,165
Speaker 4:  It break as often as like, I feel like when you're just text

351
00:21:47,165 --> 00:21:49,385
Speaker 4:  messaging, it breaks all the time.

352
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:53,545
Speaker 5:  It, it was actually worse at first. Like

353
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:57,265
Speaker 5:  when I first downloaded all the betas, it was really slow and was occasionally

354
00:21:57,655 --> 00:22:01,305
Speaker 5:  just failing to send messages at all. But in the last I would say

355
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:05,265
Speaker 5:  week it's been super stable. So I, I have, I have high hopes

356
00:22:05,285 --> 00:22:09,065
Speaker 5:  for where this is gonna land, but it was definitely wonky at first.

357
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:13,605
Speaker 3:  Alright. I, there's, we won't have to do endless follow up once this hits

358
00:22:13,605 --> 00:22:17,525
Speaker 3:  wide if people like it. Yeah. Even try the

359
00:22:17,525 --> 00:22:19,445
Speaker 3:  Phone mirroring on the Mac too. That seems amazing.

360
00:22:20,745 --> 00:22:24,245
Speaker 5:  It is. Oh boy. It is. and it isn't, but it is because it works, right? It's

361
00:22:24,245 --> 00:22:26,925
Speaker 5:  like, it's like continuity camera in the sense that like, it just, it just

362
00:22:26,925 --> 00:22:30,645
Speaker 5:  mostly does the thing and every once in a while it doesn't, for some indiscernible

363
00:22:30,645 --> 00:22:34,125
Speaker 5:  reason, like Liam, our producer, we were on a call the other day and he just

364
00:22:34,185 --> 00:22:37,045
Speaker 5:  for the whole call couldn't get continuity camera to work. And then like

365
00:22:37,045 --> 00:22:40,125
Speaker 5:  the next time you tried it works. And phone mirroring is a little like that.

366
00:22:40,505 --> 00:22:44,445
Speaker 5:  But the biggest problem is you can't change the size of the

367
00:22:44,445 --> 00:22:48,365
Speaker 5:  window. So if you're on a laptop screen, it shows up like relatively close

368
00:22:48,425 --> 00:22:51,045
Speaker 5:  to kind of real size of your iPhone, which I think is what they were going

369
00:22:51,045 --> 00:22:54,685
Speaker 5:  for. But if you're on a big densely pixel display, it shows up

370
00:22:54,815 --> 00:22:58,645
Speaker 5:  teeny tiny. It's like I'm on, I'm on a pretty, I'm on a 27 inch screen

371
00:22:58,675 --> 00:23:02,405
Speaker 5:  here and the iPhone on my screen is like half the size of my actual

372
00:23:02,405 --> 00:23:04,645
Speaker 5:  iPhone and there's nothing I can do about it. and it drives me nuts.

373
00:23:04,835 --> 00:23:07,965
Speaker 3:  That is great. I'm sorry. That's that's great.

374
00:23:08,865 --> 00:23:11,725
Speaker 3:  The, and it is like, I know that's like a beta bug. Like they have to know

375
00:23:12,345 --> 00:23:14,525
Speaker 3:  and they'll do something, but it's

376
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:17,445
Speaker 5:  Actually just resize the window. It's just hilarious. We solved, it's such

377
00:23:17,485 --> 00:23:20,325
Speaker 5:  a stage manager problem where they're like, what if we give you a new way

378
00:23:20,325 --> 00:23:23,765
Speaker 5:  to do wind? Like, no, let me drag the corner of my window to make it bigger.

379
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:24,885
Speaker 5:  This is not complicated.

380
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:28,405
Speaker 3:  It's very good. Does it? It's you don't have a touchscreen on a max. So it

381
00:23:28,405 --> 00:23:29,165
Speaker 3:  does it like do the,

382
00:23:29,545 --> 00:23:33,245
Speaker 5:  If you have the magic mouse or the magic track pad, it's great.

383
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:36,205
Speaker 5:  It just like maps all the gestures the same way you swipe and you scroll

384
00:23:36,205 --> 00:23:39,645
Speaker 5:  and everything else on a, I use a Logitech mouse

385
00:23:40,265 --> 00:23:44,045
Speaker 5:  and it's basically unusable. You, you like click on the bar at the bottom

386
00:23:44,105 --> 00:23:47,845
Speaker 5:  to go to the home screen. Some things will scroll, some things don't scroll,

387
00:23:48,025 --> 00:23:51,125
Speaker 5:  you can't scroll left and right. Like so on Instagram, if there's a gallery,

388
00:23:51,365 --> 00:23:52,685
Speaker 5:  I just can't do it.

389
00:23:54,205 --> 00:23:57,245
Speaker 5:  I think some of these things will probably get better over time. I also think

390
00:23:57,695 --> 00:24:00,365
Speaker 5:  Apple, it's, it's really, it's like on a laptop it's solid, right? Because

391
00:24:00,365 --> 00:24:02,525
Speaker 5:  you, you have the track pad, you have the gestures. That all works fine,

392
00:24:03,345 --> 00:24:07,285
Speaker 5:  but Apple is just not interested in you if you don't use

393
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:11,285
Speaker 5:  exclusively Apple gear. And so I think this is like

394
00:24:11,305 --> 00:24:14,805
Speaker 5:  for, for all of us Logitech fans out there, this is gonna be problematic.

395
00:24:15,075 --> 00:24:18,525
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I was gonna say this is, this is kind of common for all Apple integrations

396
00:24:18,585 --> 00:24:22,365
Speaker 4:  on the computer. You're just like, okay, cool. I can't do any of this unless

397
00:24:22,365 --> 00:24:25,325
Speaker 4:  I buy a magic track pad and then I have to use that instead of a really good

398
00:24:25,325 --> 00:24:27,325
Speaker 4:  mouse. I don't want to Yeah,

399
00:24:27,325 --> 00:24:30,125
Speaker 5:  Pretty much. I hate the magic track pad. Like I know there are a lot of people

400
00:24:30,145 --> 00:24:33,965
Speaker 5:  out there who really like it. I hate it. Yeah. Like I get the

401
00:24:34,035 --> 00:24:37,965
Speaker 5:  idea of it, but because it's so far away from the screen, it's so divorced

402
00:24:37,965 --> 00:24:41,365
Speaker 5:  from what's actually going on that it feels like it's trying way too hard

403
00:24:41,785 --> 00:24:45,165
Speaker 5:  and it just, it feels bad at the angle. My hands are at all the time. I

404
00:24:45,165 --> 00:24:48,965
Speaker 4:  Hate it. No, IIII can't stand it. I, that's why I use a track ball. I, because

405
00:24:48,965 --> 00:24:52,645
Speaker 4:  the track ball You can sometimes set like a key. So You can still get a lot

406
00:24:52,645 --> 00:24:55,525
Speaker 4:  of the gestures in by like hitting a key and using the ball. That's cool.

407
00:24:55,705 --> 00:24:58,325
Speaker 4:  But with the regular mouse, you're just like, well, I guess I don't, I don't

408
00:24:58,335 --> 00:25:00,765
Speaker 4:  horizontal scroll ever again. Cool.

409
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:01,925
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Can't do it. I'm out.

410
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:07,005
Speaker 3:  I can't wait to try this. A tiny little phone monkeying with a mouse. Oh,

411
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:07,245
Speaker 3:  it's

412
00:25:07,245 --> 00:25:10,925
Speaker 5:  Gonna be great. Just truly for me, I suspect there are gonna be lots of little

413
00:25:10,925 --> 00:25:13,845
Speaker 5:  things people do with it. Like for me, like the one I wrote about in the

414
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:17,805
Speaker 5:  story is my thermostat only works as a mobile app. So just being a, to

415
00:25:17,805 --> 00:25:20,565
Speaker 5:  like fire that up from my laptop is really handy without getting my phone

416
00:25:20,565 --> 00:25:24,445
Speaker 5:  outta my bag or whatever. But truly for me, it's just

417
00:25:24,445 --> 00:25:28,205
Speaker 5:  gonna be a way to drag and drop things from my computer to my phone and vice

418
00:25:28,205 --> 00:25:31,925
Speaker 5:  versa. Like it just solves the airplay problem of, I have a photo

419
00:25:31,955 --> 00:25:35,805
Speaker 5:  here and I need it to be over here. And it's, it's easier and faster

420
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:39,805
Speaker 5:  and that feature's not out yet, but it's apparently coming and just as a

421
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:41,765
Speaker 5:  drag and drop machine, I'm very excited about it.

422
00:25:42,155 --> 00:25:45,725
Speaker 3:  Yeah, you gotta get Home Bridge, dude. No, I'm Tony, you need a little

423
00:25:45,885 --> 00:25:49,205
Speaker 3:  raspberry pie that just bridges your thermostat into home Kit. You'd

424
00:25:49,205 --> 00:25:52,965
Speaker 4:  Be great. Then you get home assistance to also be a bridge into

425
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:53,485
Speaker 4:  home kit.

426
00:25:53,825 --> 00:25:55,885
Speaker 3:  We could do this for you. The Alex and I are waiting.

427
00:25:56,075 --> 00:25:57,725
Speaker 4:  Yeah, we're here, we're coming down.

428
00:25:57,865 --> 00:26:01,005
Speaker 3:  We can put a little Tamagotchi home bridge server in your house. So

429
00:26:01,005 --> 00:26:03,325
Speaker 5:  You have to care for I'm, I'm stuck at trying to get a lock for my front

430
00:26:03,325 --> 00:26:06,565
Speaker 5:  door that I can open with my fingerprint. And even that Anna's like, no,

431
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:10,365
Speaker 5:  that's why Keys are great. She's not wrong. Keys are great. Like

432
00:26:11,565 --> 00:26:11,605
Speaker 5:  somebody

433
00:26:11,605 --> 00:26:14,725
Speaker 4:  Like Hlu on it and you're just like, against it. Don't get in my house ever

434
00:26:14,725 --> 00:26:15,285
Speaker 4:  again. Exactly.

435
00:26:15,675 --> 00:26:18,645
Speaker 3:  Once you get to You can unlock this door by beeping your phone at it.

436
00:26:19,635 --> 00:26:23,605
Speaker 3:  Then the flip is my wife is like, I don't

437
00:26:23,605 --> 00:26:26,525
Speaker 3:  ever wanna see again a key. I don't ever wanna see a key again in my life.

438
00:26:27,535 --> 00:26:28,365
Speaker 3:  Don't you dare.

439
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:31,725
Speaker 3:  That's not, that's not a choice.

440
00:26:32,245 --> 00:26:34,685
Speaker 5:  I need that. We need Becky and Anna to hang out. Can we, can we make this

441
00:26:34,685 --> 00:26:34,885
Speaker 5:  happen?

442
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:38,525
Speaker 3:  We, we were test driving a rivian. So next week on decoder there, it's a

443
00:26:38,525 --> 00:26:41,845
Speaker 3:  co rivian rj sc cr and so we had Rivian to test drive and

444
00:26:42,235 --> 00:26:45,725
Speaker 3:  they didn't give us the keys. Rivian do come with a regular key fob, but

445
00:26:45,725 --> 00:26:49,285
Speaker 3:  they just gave us the cards and I showed them to, I was like, these are the

446
00:26:49,285 --> 00:26:51,045
Speaker 3:  keys. And she was like, no, they're not.

447
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:53,205
Speaker 4:  Just

448
00:26:53,205 --> 00:26:57,125
Speaker 3:  Reject it. She was just like, I'm never gonna drive that card. Like, no

449
00:26:57,125 --> 00:27:00,365
Speaker 3:  thanks. She's like, I don't wanna know anything about that at all. Like

450
00:27:00,555 --> 00:27:03,165
Speaker 3:  0% interest in your dumb key cards.

451
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:09,125
Speaker 3:  All right. We gotta talk about the biggest, the biggest thing in the beta,

452
00:27:09,215 --> 00:27:10,845
Speaker 3:  which is a calculator in the iPad.

453
00:27:11,515 --> 00:27:12,765
Speaker 4:  Yeah. That that is it. That's

454
00:27:12,785 --> 00:27:16,445
Speaker 3:  It. It's, I mean when I think about wwdc, like what did they announce? Some

455
00:27:16,685 --> 00:27:18,765
Speaker 3:  bullshit and then a calculator for the,

456
00:27:20,925 --> 00:27:21,445
Speaker 5:  That's basically right.

457
00:27:21,465 --> 00:27:23,765
Speaker 4:  Change your life. Is it like a whole new world?

458
00:27:24,785 --> 00:27:28,645
Speaker 5:  No, I, I confess I'm slightly disappointed by the whole, you,

459
00:27:28,645 --> 00:27:32,205
Speaker 3:  You haven't been doing like, like high school algebra this whole time. Wow.

460
00:27:32,425 --> 00:27:32,645
Speaker 3:  So

461
00:27:33,525 --> 00:27:37,205
Speaker 5:  I think Apple really

462
00:27:37,305 --> 00:27:40,965
Speaker 5:  thinks that if you're like a graduate

463
00:27:40,965 --> 00:27:44,805
Speaker 5:  student studying mathematics, that you're gonna love this. And I think

464
00:27:44,805 --> 00:27:47,645
Speaker 5:  Apple also thinks there's like tens of millions of those people in the world

465
00:27:48,785 --> 00:27:52,685
Speaker 5:  and they're wrong on both counts. But the, the weird thing is, so like

466
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:56,605
Speaker 5:  the calculator app is fine, right? It's a calculator app. And I think it's

467
00:27:56,605 --> 00:27:59,685
Speaker 5:  so funny that Apple is like, we wanted to really take the time to get this

468
00:27:59,685 --> 00:28:02,565
Speaker 5:  right. It's like, no dude, you shipped the calculator app and then you also

469
00:28:02,565 --> 00:28:05,685
Speaker 5:  made another feature. Like you could have just shipped the calculator app.

470
00:28:05,955 --> 00:28:09,085
Speaker 5:  It's just the calculator app with bigger buttons. I don't know, I don't know

471
00:28:09,085 --> 00:28:13,005
Speaker 5:  how to be clearer about that. That's what it is. But the cool thing is,

472
00:28:13,105 --> 00:28:16,885
Speaker 5:  is math notes, right? And it's like, that is both, it's the thing

473
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:20,565
Speaker 5:  inside of notes where You can, You can hand write stuff and it'll do the

474
00:28:20,685 --> 00:28:24,645
Speaker 5:  equations for you. And that thing is incredible when

475
00:28:24,645 --> 00:28:28,605
Speaker 5:  it works, which is a lot. But also missing some sort of obvious

476
00:28:28,605 --> 00:28:32,405
Speaker 5:  stuff. Like you write a list of numbers and then you draw a line underneath

477
00:28:32,405 --> 00:28:35,925
Speaker 5:  and it'll automatically sum those numbers up for you, right? And then You

478
00:28:35,925 --> 00:28:39,765
Speaker 5:  can actually tap on one of the numbers and, and drag a slider to make the

479
00:28:39,765 --> 00:28:43,485
Speaker 5:  number go up and down. Super cool. and it attempts to do it in your

480
00:28:43,485 --> 00:28:46,965
Speaker 5:  handwriting, which failed spectacularly for me. But I think that's just because

481
00:28:46,965 --> 00:28:50,325
Speaker 5:  my handwriting is so bad, it's like borderline unreadable. I've talked to

482
00:28:50,325 --> 00:28:53,125
Speaker 5:  some other people with pretty good handwriting and they've said it works

483
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:56,285
Speaker 5:  much better. So your mileage I think will vary depending on your handwriting.

484
00:28:57,665 --> 00:29:01,645
Speaker 5:  But there's just little things. So, right, so like, one of the use cases

485
00:29:01,995 --> 00:29:05,845
Speaker 5:  I've heard a bunch is like, you're, you're totaling up expenses for

486
00:29:05,925 --> 00:29:08,325
Speaker 5:  a weekend, right? I'm in the middle of planning vacation and we're trying

487
00:29:08,325 --> 00:29:11,125
Speaker 5:  to like total how much everything is gonna cost. So you write a bunch of

488
00:29:11,195 --> 00:29:15,005
Speaker 5:  numbers down, it'll total 'em all up for you. But then if you go

489
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:18,365
Speaker 5:  next to it and you write like food colon next to the, you know,

490
00:29:18,385 --> 00:29:22,125
Speaker 5:  $225, the whole thing falls apart. It just like

491
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:26,085
Speaker 5:  doesn't understand what your equation is anymore. and it won't total anything

492
00:29:26,085 --> 00:29:28,965
Speaker 5:  up for you. So it's like you have to, you have to operate under these very

493
00:29:28,965 --> 00:29:32,205
Speaker 5:  like, specific confines of what it understands as an equation.

494
00:29:33,185 --> 00:29:36,445
Speaker 5:  and it's awesome. And as long as you do that. So this is what I mean by like

495
00:29:36,685 --> 00:29:39,565
Speaker 5:  graduate math, right? Like if you're sitting there doing math problems as

496
00:29:39,565 --> 00:29:42,885
Speaker 5:  math problems, it's awesome, awesome. and it works really well. But if you're

497
00:29:42,885 --> 00:29:46,565
Speaker 5:  like a person taking notes and you want to do math inside of them,

498
00:29:48,105 --> 00:29:50,485
Speaker 5:  it doesn't work quite as well. Mm. Does that make sense?

499
00:29:50,825 --> 00:29:53,445
Speaker 4:  So it's for like just kids who have homework,

500
00:29:53,915 --> 00:29:57,005
Speaker 5:  It's for doing math. Like I, it's like that really is what it is. It's like

501
00:29:57,035 --> 00:30:00,805
Speaker 5:  what I want it to be is like do the math inside of my notes

502
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:04,485
Speaker 5:  as I take notes. and it is not for that, it's for doing math problems.

503
00:30:04,785 --> 00:30:07,965
Speaker 4:  Do you think that the iPad Pro is now gonna become

504
00:30:08,585 --> 00:30:12,485
Speaker 4:  two like mathematicians and scientists, what the iPad Mini was to

505
00:30:12,505 --> 00:30:12,925
Speaker 4:  pilots?

506
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:18,765
Speaker 5:  I need to, I need to write this story. I'm so convinced that this

507
00:30:19,015 --> 00:30:21,125
Speaker 5:  pilot thing is a lie

508
00:30:23,945 --> 00:30:24,165
Speaker 3:  And

509
00:30:24,205 --> 00:30:25,765
Speaker 5:  I have no evidence for this, but

510
00:30:25,765 --> 00:30:25,965
Speaker 3:  I'm,

511
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:29,605
Speaker 5:  I'm, I'm so sure that like three Delta Pilots got iPad

512
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:32,485
Speaker 5:  Minis and then Apple was like, yes, this is it.

513
00:30:34,225 --> 00:30:34,445
Speaker 3:  And

514
00:30:34,745 --> 00:30:37,965
Speaker 5:  It is only time I fly. They're still bringing on briefcase full of paperwork.

515
00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:41,205
Speaker 5:  Like if this got replaced by iPads, I don't know where it is.

516
00:30:41,905 --> 00:30:45,845
Speaker 5:  But. anyway, all that aside, I do think Apple really, really, really, really

517
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:49,285
Speaker 5:  wants the iPad to be an education device. Like I think the way that a, a

518
00:30:49,285 --> 00:30:53,085
Speaker 5:  whole generation grew up with Max in the classroom

519
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:57,925
Speaker 5:  and basically the generations recently have grown up with Chromebooks. Apple

520
00:30:57,985 --> 00:31:01,885
Speaker 5:  is like desperate for that thing to be iPads. And I think it sees the pencil

521
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:05,365
Speaker 5:  in particular as a way to get there. I don't

522
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:09,685
Speaker 5:  necessarily know if it's gonna work. I'm also not the Target demo, so I don't

523
00:31:09,685 --> 00:31:13,485
Speaker 5:  know. Yeah. But like it's very clear that that is like, even, even

524
00:31:13,485 --> 00:31:16,725
Speaker 5:  going back and looking at the demos, they're, they're doing really sophisticated

525
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,525
Speaker 5:  math, like not the kind of thing that a normal person does in their day-to-Day

526
00:31:20,525 --> 00:31:24,205
Speaker 5:  life. And I think for the sophisticated stuff, it, it works better than for

527
00:31:24,205 --> 00:31:26,685
Speaker 5:  just like trying to make sense of my notes.

528
00:31:27,065 --> 00:31:30,885
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna miss Texas Instruments when the TI 83 gets killed by the iPad Pro,

529
00:31:31,075 --> 00:31:34,805
Speaker 3:  There's a store in my little town. I'm not sure if they

530
00:31:34,805 --> 00:31:38,205
Speaker 3:  make any money selling anything other than T 80 threes to the high schoolers.

531
00:31:38,445 --> 00:31:41,445
Speaker 3:  Like they just have a wall of T 80 threes and then all the high schoolers

532
00:31:41,445 --> 00:31:45,405
Speaker 3:  in town go to that store to buy their TA 83. And I, it's just

533
00:31:45,425 --> 00:31:48,685
Speaker 3:  so confusing. The whole thing is confusing to me. Especially because

534
00:31:49,195 --> 00:31:52,965
Speaker 3:  when I was in high school 20 years ago, we were using

535
00:31:53,165 --> 00:31:56,765
Speaker 3:  T 80 threes. Yeah. 25 years ago we were using

536
00:31:56,905 --> 00:32:00,845
Speaker 5:  Is that the most enduring technology like it might be of the last two

537
00:32:00,845 --> 00:32:01,445
Speaker 5:  decades? Might

538
00:32:01,445 --> 00:32:02,125
Speaker 4:  Be. I feel like it is.

539
00:32:02,945 --> 00:32:06,605
Speaker 3:  Here's what I learned about the TI 82. The 83 is different. The

540
00:32:06,915 --> 00:32:10,605
Speaker 3:  case of a T 82, the Shell was exactly

541
00:32:10,745 --> 00:32:14,685
Speaker 3:  the right size to fit a game boy pocket. So You

542
00:32:14,685 --> 00:32:17,485
Speaker 3:  can just slide a game boy pocket up into that shell.

543
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:21,805
Speaker 3:  And the thing that we had to figure out was how to hide the sound. The game

544
00:32:21,805 --> 00:32:23,085
Speaker 3:  boy, you know, ding your

545
00:32:23,085 --> 00:32:25,885
Speaker 5:  Teacher's like, gosh, Neil is really doing some calculations over

546
00:32:25,885 --> 00:32:26,805
Speaker 3:  There. We were

547
00:32:27,075 --> 00:32:28,485
Speaker 4:  Furiously calculating,

548
00:32:28,485 --> 00:32:30,525
Speaker 3:  Dude, you were just fully playing Game boy in the back of that.

549
00:32:31,755 --> 00:32:34,565
Speaker 5:  He's, he's math and so hard. His parents are gonna be so proud.

550
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:39,525
Speaker 3:  But the problem, you had to turn it on before, before he walked in.

551
00:32:39,645 --> 00:32:42,285
Speaker 3:  'cause you can't shut off the startup hep of a game Boy Pocket.

552
00:32:42,555 --> 00:32:43,645
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Ding.

553
00:32:44,525 --> 00:32:46,125
Speaker 3:  Definitely not caught at least once.

554
00:32:48,705 --> 00:32:52,165
Speaker 3:  All right. Two other Apple things I wanna talk about. One very, very funny.

555
00:32:53,935 --> 00:32:57,605
Speaker 3:  Apple has partnered with Taboola to put ads in Apple News. You don't know

556
00:32:57,605 --> 00:33:01,485
Speaker 3:  what Taboola is, except you obviously do. It's the Trump box provider on

557
00:33:01,485 --> 00:33:04,485
Speaker 3:  every website in the world, including our own. We don't, we don't like it.

558
00:33:05,225 --> 00:33:07,805
Speaker 3:  But you know, we don't work for free. So there's some Taboola ads at the

559
00:33:07,805 --> 00:33:10,765
Speaker 3:  bottom of our pages that make our company some money and then they pay the

560
00:33:10,765 --> 00:33:13,925
Speaker 3:  bills. It's famously the belly fat ads, right? Like for years. Yeah. That

561
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:17,205
Speaker 3:  was who was serving the belly fats. And we've written stories about the belly

562
00:33:17,225 --> 00:33:20,365
Speaker 3:  fat ads. I I think it was Caitlin Tiffany wrote a story for us that like

563
00:33:20,585 --> 00:33:24,485
Speaker 3:  chased all the way down what the one weird vegetable is. Oh no way.

564
00:33:24,675 --> 00:33:25,245
Speaker 3:  It's corn.

565
00:33:29,115 --> 00:33:31,205
Speaker 3:  It's nonsensical. Yeah.

566
00:33:34,785 --> 00:33:37,685
Speaker 3:  All bad. But Apple doesn't wanna do ads.

567
00:33:38,595 --> 00:33:42,045
Speaker 3:  They had a partnership with NBC to sell ads in Apple News. It didn't work.

568
00:33:42,245 --> 00:33:45,005
Speaker 3:  I don't think they got the scale. And now they have this partnership with

569
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:48,365
Speaker 3:  Tabula and it's like, what, what kind of ads are we gonna see in Apple News

570
00:33:48,385 --> 00:33:52,165
Speaker 3:  now? And then you look in Tabula is actually a huge company.

571
00:33:53,435 --> 00:33:57,325
Speaker 3:  Like massive company. 'cause they just put the garbage across

572
00:33:57,325 --> 00:34:01,165
Speaker 3:  the entire web. And wait, did Tabula buy Outbrain the other chum box

573
00:34:01,405 --> 00:34:04,845
Speaker 3:  provider? Or was it vice versa? No, it didn't happen. It got, it got broken.

574
00:34:05,305 --> 00:34:08,045
Speaker 3:  Oh, it was, it was so big it wasn't allowed. Yeah.

575
00:34:10,505 --> 00:34:14,365
Speaker 4:  The FTC said no, only we must have competition in the

576
00:34:14,365 --> 00:34:15,805
Speaker 4:  chum box industry.

577
00:34:16,325 --> 00:34:20,165
Speaker 3:  I can't believe we didn't do features on chum box warfare. Oh my God.

578
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:24,405
Speaker 3:  Anyhow. Very bad. One of the least, one

579
00:34:24,405 --> 00:34:28,365
Speaker 3:  of the least on-brand deals in Apple history. Yeah. And I

580
00:34:28,365 --> 00:34:30,765
Speaker 3:  think they're gonna, I think they're gonna keep it. 'cause what are you gonna

581
00:34:30,765 --> 00:34:34,685
Speaker 3:  do? I think Apple's at the, what you gonna do phase of this where

582
00:34:34,685 --> 00:34:37,525
Speaker 3:  they were just like, yeah, whatever. It's money. What, what are you, what

583
00:34:37,525 --> 00:34:39,685
Speaker 3:  are you gonna do? You're gonna go somewhere else. You're gonna not read Apple

584
00:34:39,685 --> 00:34:43,245
Speaker 3:  News publishers are gonna, you're gonna respond to

585
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:47,605
Speaker 3:  chum boxes and Apple. Well look at your sites. And I I think they're

586
00:34:47,605 --> 00:34:50,845
Speaker 3:  just gonna take the money. I I there's no way that unless it's like

587
00:34:51,405 --> 00:34:54,525
Speaker 3:  egregiously bad, which with Tabula it could be egregiously bad. Yeah.

588
00:34:56,245 --> 00:34:59,565
Speaker 3:  I dunno. Just a weird deal for them all the way around. Like people reacted

589
00:34:59,565 --> 00:35:03,405
Speaker 3:  to it so negatively and I don't think they give a shit. Yeah, well I

590
00:35:03,405 --> 00:35:07,165
Speaker 4:  Think that's right. It's just Apple being a content creator, right?

591
00:35:07,165 --> 00:35:10,885
Speaker 4:  Like, like they're, they're in the, the, the industry of content now in a

592
00:35:10,885 --> 00:35:13,085
Speaker 4:  way they haven't been in for A long time. And this is just like

593
00:35:14,255 --> 00:35:15,925
Speaker 4:  finalizing the form for that.

594
00:35:16,635 --> 00:35:19,725
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It's just, if you think about Apple's pitch to everyone,

595
00:35:21,115 --> 00:35:22,525
Speaker 4:  This is not it. This is like

596
00:35:22,525 --> 00:35:25,645
Speaker 3:  Right. It's like premium experience. It's,

597
00:35:26,555 --> 00:35:30,085
Speaker 3:  this is trusted publishers. It's not just garbage and then, or

598
00:35:30,385 --> 00:35:34,125
Speaker 3:  Tabula ads. Yeah. I mean this is what, this is what endlessly chasing

599
00:35:34,485 --> 00:35:36,725
Speaker 3:  services revenue eventually leads you to,

600
00:35:36,725 --> 00:35:40,685
Speaker 5:  Right? Yeah. Like, it, it just, it just gets uglier and uglier as time

601
00:35:40,685 --> 00:35:44,405
Speaker 5:  goes on because you have to keep finding ways to turn pennies

602
00:35:44,405 --> 00:35:47,725
Speaker 5:  into dollars and turn free things into pennies. And

603
00:35:48,435 --> 00:35:51,325
Speaker 5:  it's, it sucks And like it's, this is gonna go in the news app, it's gonna

604
00:35:51,325 --> 00:35:54,085
Speaker 5:  go in the stocks app. Like Apple has gotten

605
00:35:54,985 --> 00:35:58,685
Speaker 5:  slowly sort of frog boilingly aggressive

606
00:35:58,685 --> 00:36:02,125
Speaker 5:  about advertising all over iOS. Yeah. And

607
00:36:02,915 --> 00:36:06,365
Speaker 5:  this just feels like, it feels like it's about, this will not be the last

608
00:36:06,535 --> 00:36:09,925
Speaker 5:  thing we see from Apple with ugly ads, I don't think. But

609
00:36:09,925 --> 00:36:13,845
Speaker 4:  But don't worry David, because in just seven days you two can

610
00:36:13,885 --> 00:36:15,525
Speaker 4:  lose seven inches off your waistline.

611
00:36:16,345 --> 00:36:17,485
Speaker 3:  But not if you eat corn,

612
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:19,925
Speaker 4:  Stay away from corn, the

613
00:36:20,105 --> 00:36:23,245
Speaker 3:  Get this great vegetable you, you have to avoid. Avoid. Why don't we hawk

614
00:36:23,245 --> 00:36:26,845
Speaker 3:  supplements? We could all, we could be doing the show in a boat. The other

615
00:36:26,845 --> 00:36:30,805
Speaker 3:  piece of Apple News much more. I I don't think we're ever gonna hawk

616
00:36:30,805 --> 00:36:34,005
Speaker 3:  supplements. Look, I I, you all know that I want a boat, but there's, there's

617
00:36:34,005 --> 00:36:36,205
Speaker 3:  a line and that's it.

618
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,285
Speaker 3:  The lightning round remains unsponsored. I'll just put one after.

619
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:43,285
Speaker 5:  If you go buy Eli a boat called supplements though, that's pretty funny.

620
00:36:43,545 --> 00:36:44,685
Speaker 5:  And I'll allow that

621
00:36:45,615 --> 00:36:47,285
Speaker 4:  Still on the table. That's still on the table.

622
00:36:48,785 --> 00:36:51,685
Speaker 3:  And there's one last piece. Apple I think is really interesting and sort

623
00:36:51,685 --> 00:36:55,645
Speaker 3:  of like in a tangential way related, which

624
00:36:55,645 --> 00:36:59,565
Speaker 3:  is the sort of competitive pressure put on the app store

625
00:37:00,265 --> 00:37:03,965
Speaker 3:  by the DMA and the eu. And by emulators means that Apple

626
00:37:04,065 --> 00:37:07,405
Speaker 3:  has now approved the first like nineties

627
00:37:07,865 --> 00:37:11,765
Speaker 3:  PC emulator for iOS. So it can, it's it's

628
00:37:11,965 --> 00:37:15,885
Speaker 3:  U-T-M-S-C. It can run Windows XP that looks

629
00:37:15,885 --> 00:37:19,765
Speaker 3:  like Windows xp, Mac Stein and, and Linux. If you

630
00:37:19,765 --> 00:37:22,805
Speaker 3:  wanna run Linux on your phone, which I think you do,

631
00:37:23,835 --> 00:37:27,165
Speaker 3:  this was, they rejected it, it was gonna go into alt store

632
00:37:27,785 --> 00:37:31,645
Speaker 3:  and then Apple approved it. And You can see just

633
00:37:31,675 --> 00:37:35,485
Speaker 3:  that competitive dynamic occurring where they do not

634
00:37:35,555 --> 00:37:39,445
Speaker 3:  want the other store to be good. Yep. So they're loosening

635
00:37:39,445 --> 00:37:43,205
Speaker 3:  the rules of their own store over and over again. And that

636
00:37:43,205 --> 00:37:45,205
Speaker 3:  competition is working. It

637
00:37:45,205 --> 00:37:45,405
Speaker 4:  Rules,

638
00:37:45,725 --> 00:37:49,645
Speaker 5:  I think it was ri test it who, who runs alt store and

639
00:37:49,755 --> 00:37:53,685
Speaker 5:  does Delta and has been on this show a couple of times. I think it was him

640
00:37:53,685 --> 00:37:57,165
Speaker 5:  that posted, basically it turns out the best way to get your app onto the

641
00:37:57,165 --> 00:37:59,325
Speaker 5:  app store is to is to threaten to be on alt store.

642
00:37:59,665 --> 00:38:01,605
Speaker 4:  That's exactly, yeah. He did it.

643
00:38:01,605 --> 00:38:05,485
Speaker 5:  It it's true. Like it is, it is real that like any,

644
00:38:06,065 --> 00:38:09,885
Speaker 5:  it is increasingly clear that if you want to get something onto an iPhone,

645
00:38:09,885 --> 00:38:12,765
Speaker 5:  there are going to be other ways to do it. And Apple is so desperate to keep

646
00:38:12,765 --> 00:38:15,285
Speaker 5:  you in the app store that it will bend its rules in any direction. It has

647
00:38:15,285 --> 00:38:19,045
Speaker 5:  to to keep you there. I believe I owe somebody some money because

648
00:38:19,205 --> 00:38:22,925
Speaker 5:  I said on this show not that long ago, I would be shocked if we got a

649
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:26,645
Speaker 5:  full PC emulator because Apple's rules

650
00:38:26,645 --> 00:38:30,485
Speaker 5:  have been very clear that it is a, it is like, it's it's for retro games,

651
00:38:30,485 --> 00:38:34,365
Speaker 5:  right? Like that was clearly what Apple wanted these things to be for. So

652
00:38:34,365 --> 00:38:38,165
Speaker 5:  this strikes me as yet another goalpost move that

653
00:38:38,245 --> 00:38:40,525
Speaker 5:  I didn't even expect. No. For what Apple will allow.

654
00:38:40,825 --> 00:38:43,765
Speaker 4:  Is it, is it a, is it a PC emulator? It's, it's xp.

655
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:49,085
Speaker 5:  Well, so UTM will let you emulate all the way up through Windows 11. Okay.

656
00:38:49,105 --> 00:38:52,885
Speaker 5:  So I, I don't, I don't, I have not tried it in the app so I don't

657
00:38:53,045 --> 00:38:54,205
Speaker 5:  actually know what's possible. Yeah.

658
00:38:54,205 --> 00:38:58,045
Speaker 4:  But like we Davis was trying out XP and it took him like two hours

659
00:38:58,625 --> 00:38:59,685
Speaker 4:  to install it.

660
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:00,165
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

661
00:39:00,165 --> 00:39:03,445
Speaker 5:  These things are not easy, but like it, it'll You can emulate it an X 86

662
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:07,565
Speaker 5:  pc. Like I think with some work there's

663
00:39:07,725 --> 00:39:10,605
Speaker 5:  probably a lot more You can do here than gets credit for. Also you could

664
00:39:10,925 --> 00:39:14,645
Speaker 5:  emulate XP and then emulate a Windows 11

665
00:39:14,965 --> 00:39:18,805
Speaker 5:  computer with an emulator on Windows XP and just, just turtles all the way

666
00:39:18,805 --> 00:39:20,045
Speaker 5:  down this bitch. Yeah.

667
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:21,285
Speaker 4:  Yes. Hell yes.

668
00:39:21,825 --> 00:39:25,725
Speaker 3:  So I think it's so there's a reason they've not wanted like general purpose

669
00:39:26,045 --> 00:39:28,965
Speaker 3:  computer emulators 'cause they don't want people to run apps on them,

670
00:39:29,695 --> 00:39:33,685
Speaker 3:  right. Like that. It's a big complicated loophole. But

671
00:39:33,685 --> 00:39:37,125
Speaker 3:  it's a loophole, right? Yeah. You, you put a general purpose PC emulator

672
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:41,005
Speaker 3:  on the phone and then anyone can just run whatever software they want without

673
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:44,925
Speaker 3:  paying Apple 30%. Yep. Not a loophole that Apple will allow. But

674
00:39:44,925 --> 00:39:47,405
Speaker 3:  now they've allowed it. And what's fascinating to me about this is like maybe

675
00:39:47,405 --> 00:39:50,525
Speaker 3:  on the phone this isn't such a big deal 'cause whatever, it's a phone,

676
00:39:51,425 --> 00:39:55,205
Speaker 3:  an iPad running Macs nine or even

677
00:39:55,205 --> 00:39:58,125
Speaker 3:  Windows XP is like, wait, does this rule?

678
00:39:59,475 --> 00:40:03,125
Speaker 3:  Like is that I did a lot of work in Macs nine. I like

679
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:06,565
Speaker 3:  many things happened in my life in the context of Macs nine.

680
00:40:08,635 --> 00:40:12,485
Speaker 3:  Like yeah, I'll, I'll just run Mac West nine in my head all day. It has

681
00:40:12,485 --> 00:40:14,645
Speaker 3:  better multitasking the iPad does today.

682
00:40:14,925 --> 00:40:15,565
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That's real.

683
00:40:16,145 --> 00:40:17,565
Speaker 4:  And more customization too.

684
00:40:18,675 --> 00:40:22,205
Speaker 3:  Yeah. The apps me the just quit in the background on you all the time in

685
00:40:22,205 --> 00:40:25,285
Speaker 3:  Mac West nine Windows XP actually has

686
00:40:26,435 --> 00:40:29,605
Speaker 3:  technically more advanced multitasking than macOS nine.

687
00:40:30,465 --> 00:40:34,045
Speaker 3:  So it's just like you just like find yourself running in this circle where

688
00:40:34,045 --> 00:40:37,045
Speaker 3:  you're like, wait, does the window management and multitasking of an emulated

689
00:40:37,045 --> 00:40:40,405
Speaker 3:  operating system from 20 years ago, is that a better iPad experience?

690
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:43,685
Speaker 5:  I mean it honestly might be. Yeah. Do you think we're gonna get to the point

691
00:40:43,685 --> 00:40:47,365
Speaker 5:  where You can emulate a Mac on your iPhone and then

692
00:40:47,385 --> 00:40:50,845
Speaker 5:  mirror your phone to that Mac that's being emulated on your iPhone and then

693
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:51,485
Speaker 5:  use that phone?

694
00:40:51,985 --> 00:40:52,725
Speaker 4:  God, I hope so.

695
00:40:52,945 --> 00:40:54,365
Speaker 5:  That's the dream right there. That's

696
00:40:54,365 --> 00:40:54,725
Speaker 4:  The dream. Yes.

697
00:40:54,805 --> 00:40:58,685
Speaker 5:  I wanna use my phone three level steam on my phone.

698
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:00,845
Speaker 5:  That's what I'm going for. I

699
00:41:00,845 --> 00:41:03,565
Speaker 4:  Think you just invented Atrix, the Motorola Atrix.

700
00:41:04,025 --> 00:41:08,005
Speaker 3:  Oh man. The thing ruled. It did not. No it did not. Anyway.

701
00:41:08,865 --> 00:41:12,725
Speaker 3:  I'm very excited for this emulation scene in particular to hit the iPad

702
00:41:13,365 --> 00:41:17,205
Speaker 3:  because this is the thing that Apple has feared And. if you get to a place

703
00:41:17,205 --> 00:41:21,125
Speaker 3:  where it's just like easy where it's like push a button and turn

704
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:24,565
Speaker 3:  your iPad into a Windows PC and people start doing it.

705
00:41:25,185 --> 00:41:28,605
Speaker 3:  That's the thing that makes Apple Jake iPad multitasking. Seriously. I don't.

706
00:41:28,605 --> 00:41:32,325
Speaker 3:  We're gonna get there. It just, there's a glimmer of it now, which is fascinating

707
00:41:32,955 --> 00:41:36,845
Speaker 3:  competition. It works. Yeah. All right. We gotta take a break. We are just,

708
00:41:36,965 --> 00:41:39,645
Speaker 3:  I don't even know we're way over. It's, it's next week already. We'll be

709
00:41:39,645 --> 00:41:39,925
Speaker 3:  right back.

710
00:42:18,485 --> 00:42:21,805
Speaker 1:  best part is You can find meta AI right in the apps you already have

711
00:42:22,395 --> 00:42:25,645
Speaker 1:  Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Messenger.

712
00:43:40,165 --> 00:43:41,685
Speaker 5:  things that have made you feel a lot of feelings.

713
00:43:41,795 --> 00:43:45,125
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Okay. So there's a new Canon EOS R one and R five mark two.

714
00:43:45,825 --> 00:43:49,245
Speaker 3:  And they are some of the first cameras, especially pro cameras like this

715
00:43:49,315 --> 00:43:52,725
Speaker 3:  from brands like this that just have AI features in them.

716
00:43:53,265 --> 00:43:57,165
Speaker 3:  And the AI features are fine. Like I, they're fine. They have

717
00:43:57,525 --> 00:44:00,805
Speaker 3:  noise reduction that gets you two more stops. So You can

718
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,925
Speaker 3:  run the ISO a little bit hotter and the noise direction is good.

719
00:44:04,985 --> 00:44:08,405
Speaker 3:  That's AI powered. And then they have 400% image

720
00:44:08,405 --> 00:44:12,245
Speaker 3:  upscaling, which is bananas. So if you just think about it, they've got a

721
00:44:12,245 --> 00:44:15,445
Speaker 3:  sensor in them. Light hits the sensor that makes the image. The sensor is

722
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:19,205
Speaker 3:  usually, it determines the size of the image. Now the cameras can just

723
00:44:19,715 --> 00:44:21,605
Speaker 3:  make you an image that's four times bigger.

724
00:44:22,205 --> 00:44:24,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah. The image is however big you want it to be.

725
00:44:24,385 --> 00:44:27,405
Speaker 3:  And it's just in the camera. and it is based on the fact that the camera

726
00:44:27,535 --> 00:44:31,245
Speaker 3:  knows everything about the light hitting the sensor. It knows the lens you're

727
00:44:31,245 --> 00:44:34,725
Speaker 3:  using. It knows the settings you're at. And so, you know, the argument is

728
00:44:34,725 --> 00:44:38,645
Speaker 3:  their AI upscaling will be better in camera 'cause it's all

729
00:44:38,665 --> 00:44:42,165
Speaker 3:  one closed ecosystem than if you take it out to one of the many, many, many

730
00:44:42,405 --> 00:44:46,045
Speaker 3:  software up upscales that exist out in the world. Weird.

731
00:44:46,055 --> 00:44:49,885
Speaker 3:  Right. Weird to have the camera itself generate

732
00:44:50,065 --> 00:44:50,925
Speaker 3:  pixels that weren't there.

733
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:54,045
Speaker 5:  I mean this is the stuff we've been talking about with smartphones for like

734
00:44:54,045 --> 00:44:57,245
Speaker 5:  two years now. Right? And we're now at a point where

735
00:44:57,875 --> 00:45:01,845
Speaker 5:  this feels like it's about to become unavoidable. And there

736
00:45:01,845 --> 00:45:04,485
Speaker 5:  there was a thing where it was like, okay, the the like last

737
00:45:05,395 --> 00:45:08,845
Speaker 5:  bastion of photo or photographic

738
00:45:09,285 --> 00:45:13,045
Speaker 5:  honesty is going to be these like fancy high-end

739
00:45:13,045 --> 00:45:16,765
Speaker 5:  cameras. And even that is going away like really, really fast.

740
00:45:17,225 --> 00:45:20,885
Speaker 4:  I'm just so surprised it's Canon doing it and not like

741
00:45:21,355 --> 00:45:24,965
Speaker 4:  Sony or or Panasonic or anybody else who's been in the

742
00:45:25,005 --> 00:45:25,885
Speaker 4:  muralist game.

743
00:45:26,235 --> 00:45:28,805
Speaker 5:  This doesn't seem like a Panasonic move. They're like, do you want our cameras

744
00:45:28,905 --> 00:45:30,205
Speaker 5:  now? How about this? Yeah,

745
00:45:30,315 --> 00:45:33,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Right. Like, like Olympus, like these companies have all been here

746
00:45:33,615 --> 00:45:37,445
Speaker 4:  doing muralist cameras for a lot longer than Canon and, and messing

747
00:45:37,445 --> 00:45:40,525
Speaker 4:  with like computational photography a lot longer than Canon. And Canon was

748
00:45:40,525 --> 00:45:41,885
Speaker 4:  like, Nope, we're doing it now.

749
00:45:42,795 --> 00:45:43,085
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

750
00:45:43,805 --> 00:45:45,645
Speaker 4:  I mean that's exactly how Canon talks by the way.

751
00:45:46,395 --> 00:45:47,325
Speaker 3:  They I agree.

752
00:45:47,505 --> 00:45:50,365
Speaker 5:  Thomas Canon, the Thomas Cannon just out there yelling.

753
00:45:52,145 --> 00:45:55,005
Speaker 3:  So it's wonky. You gotta use some Canon menus.

754
00:45:56,025 --> 00:45:59,845
Speaker 3:  The cameras can only do it with pictures they taken themselves. Oddly

755
00:46:00,145 --> 00:46:03,805
Speaker 3:  the upscaling only works with JPEGs and Acfs

756
00:46:03,965 --> 00:46:07,645
Speaker 3:  in case you're a sort of monster shooting Heaths on your

757
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,325
Speaker 3:  DORI

758
00:46:09,325 --> 00:46:11,645
Speaker 5:  What you're doing. I wonder if that's an intentional choice that they're

759
00:46:11,645 --> 00:46:15,245
Speaker 5:  like, we, we have to preserve the sanctity of the raw file, I feel like,

760
00:46:15,245 --> 00:46:17,765
Speaker 5:  but we start to do weirder stuff with some of these other things. Well

761
00:46:17,765 --> 00:46:21,725
Speaker 4:  Yeah, Canon's also always done kind of weird stuff with the, the the regular

762
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:25,485
Speaker 4:  ones, right? Like the JPEGs, they they would make 'em warmer too. Like it

763
00:46:25,485 --> 00:46:28,045
Speaker 4:  was noticeably warmer on a Canon jpeg.

764
00:46:28,355 --> 00:46:31,965
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I mean look, going from a raw to a JPEG is a processing step.

765
00:46:31,965 --> 00:46:35,805
Speaker 3:  There's stylistic choices You can make It is if you have

766
00:46:35,845 --> 00:46:39,605
Speaker 3:  a modern DSLR and you shoot raw at high ISOs,

767
00:46:39,705 --> 00:46:42,605
Speaker 3:  the pictures are gonna be noisier than the JPEGs. 'cause the JPEGs have noise

768
00:46:42,805 --> 00:46:46,405
Speaker 3:  reduction built into them. But like that is usually taking

769
00:46:46,425 --> 00:46:50,365
Speaker 3:  detail out, Not adding it in. And so like you're like, yeah, I

770
00:46:50,635 --> 00:46:54,085
Speaker 3:  like, I personally love the AI noise removal in Lightroom. I use it all the

771
00:46:54,085 --> 00:46:57,605
Speaker 3:  time. I think I've said on the show, like it has re it has changed my

772
00:46:57,605 --> 00:47:01,125
Speaker 3:  relationship to some of my older cameras 'cause it's so good. But now the

773
00:47:01,125 --> 00:47:04,845
Speaker 3:  camera's doing it itself and there's none as far as I can tell, none of the

774
00:47:04,945 --> 00:47:07,765
Speaker 3:  AI metadata that everyone has been talking about putting into these things

775
00:47:08,345 --> 00:47:11,805
Speaker 3:  to indicate that some of these pixels are fake. Like the computer just made

776
00:47:11,805 --> 00:47:14,325
Speaker 3:  up some of these pixels, some of these details might not have been there.

777
00:47:14,355 --> 00:47:18,245
Speaker 3:  Like we don't know in, in the examples I've seen

778
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:21,365
Speaker 3:  it's kind of accurate, but then you're like, ah, is that right? Like, we

779
00:47:21,365 --> 00:47:24,005
Speaker 3:  just don't know how it's gonna work in every case. And then the,

780
00:47:25,145 --> 00:47:29,005
Speaker 3:  the chain of like metadata that you would need to

781
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:32,845
Speaker 3:  verify this is a real image. No, it just isn't. It just doesn't

782
00:47:32,845 --> 00:47:35,925
Speaker 3:  exist. And actually, you know, we were talking about the Trump, the images

783
00:47:35,945 --> 00:47:39,805
Speaker 3:  of the Trump shooting, immediate AI generated

784
00:47:39,805 --> 00:47:43,765
Speaker 3:  images from that AI modifications, lots and lots of

785
00:47:43,765 --> 00:47:47,005
Speaker 3:  weird images. They changed the secret service agents to smiling in some,

786
00:47:47,005 --> 00:47:50,885
Speaker 3:  like all this like crazy stuff and all of this stuff that

787
00:47:50,885 --> 00:47:54,485
Speaker 3:  we have talked about for years about content authenticity, about

788
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:57,085
Speaker 3:  labels, about blah blah. It's just out the window. Yeah.

789
00:47:57,085 --> 00:47:57,605
Speaker 5:  Nowhere to

790
00:47:57,605 --> 00:48:00,645
Speaker 3:  Be found. Yeah. I was like, none of that worked. Like, nope, you're like,

791
00:48:00,645 --> 00:48:02,885
Speaker 3:  we're gonna build in all these safeguards like are you using any safeguards?

792
00:48:02,885 --> 00:48:06,085
Speaker 3:  It's like, no. Like we were overwhelmed by sheer volume of crap.

793
00:48:07,305 --> 00:48:11,005
Speaker 3:  And so like it's just fascinating. The canons putting it in the camera now,

794
00:48:11,025 --> 00:48:15,005
Speaker 3:  it is buried in the menu system of a professional Canon diosa. It is

795
00:48:15,005 --> 00:48:18,165
Speaker 3:  not, the apocalypse is not totally here yet, but it's, it's like staring

796
00:48:18,165 --> 00:48:18,645
Speaker 3:  us in the face.

797
00:48:18,785 --> 00:48:21,205
Speaker 5:  That's kind of the thing I've been thinking about with this this week is

798
00:48:21,745 --> 00:48:25,405
Speaker 5:  the thing you said, and I think it was around the Pixel last year

799
00:48:25,775 --> 00:48:29,525
Speaker 5:  about like the question is where in the pipeline do you encounter this ability?

800
00:48:29,625 --> 00:48:32,645
Speaker 5:  And that ends up being really important. Like in, in Lightroom that's an

801
00:48:32,645 --> 00:48:35,245
Speaker 5:  app you downloaded onto your computer that you brought your phone in or your

802
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:39,165
Speaker 5:  photo into and you pressed a button on purpose to do it. And that, that feels

803
00:48:39,165 --> 00:48:43,045
Speaker 5:  like one thing as opposed to having it happen, you know in

804
00:48:43,085 --> 00:48:46,925
Speaker 5:  Google photos where your photos live or in the app on your phone

805
00:48:47,095 --> 00:48:50,885
Speaker 5:  where the photos go, like the camera roll and this goes even further to,

806
00:48:50,915 --> 00:48:54,885
Speaker 5:  okay now it's a setting on your camera. What if you move it to being

807
00:48:54,885 --> 00:48:57,525
Speaker 5:  a button on your camera to what if you move it to just being there on your

808
00:48:57,525 --> 00:49:01,485
Speaker 5:  camera by default. Like where this goes from a thing I'm doing

809
00:49:01,825 --> 00:49:05,565
Speaker 5:  to, you've just completely changed what is happening without me even

810
00:49:05,615 --> 00:49:09,525
Speaker 5:  being aware of it all. Just feels very weird Yeah. And as soon as you

811
00:49:09,525 --> 00:49:12,485
Speaker 5:  move it to the device, it feels like you've, you've shifted that threshold

812
00:49:12,485 --> 00:49:16,165
Speaker 5:  in a pretty meaningful way because now I think like what, what a lot of people

813
00:49:16,275 --> 00:49:19,645
Speaker 5:  want reasonably is to be able to just take photos off of their camera and

814
00:49:19,675 --> 00:49:23,245
Speaker 5:  have them be good. Right? Like that, that's a good outcome. I don't think

815
00:49:23,245 --> 00:49:26,325
Speaker 5:  most people want to muck around with their photos in Lightroom. So in a certain

816
00:49:26,325 --> 00:49:29,205
Speaker 5:  way it makes sense to say, okay, this thing that you're doing, that we can

817
00:49:29,325 --> 00:49:31,885
Speaker 5:  actually do very well with ai, we're just gonna do it for you because it's

818
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:35,765
Speaker 5:  a good thing. but it, it, it changes that to, this is now something you've

819
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:39,725
Speaker 5:  done to my photos rather than something I am able to

820
00:49:39,725 --> 00:49:41,725
Speaker 5:  do. and it does, it does change things.

821
00:49:42,085 --> 00:49:45,765
Speaker 4:  I can't wait for the first like, wedding photographer who uses this and gets

822
00:49:45,845 --> 00:49:48,645
Speaker 4:  a whole new like, set of lace detailing on a wedding dress

823
00:49:48,905 --> 00:49:50,485
Speaker 5:  Or just like a new bridesmaid. Yeah.

824
00:49:50,485 --> 00:49:53,365
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's like there's an extra one there now. Yeah. What's up girl?

825
00:49:53,645 --> 00:49:57,525
Speaker 3:  I mean, look, the R one is 62 99. The R five mark two

826
00:49:57,605 --> 00:50:01,485
Speaker 3:  is 42 99. If they could be like add bridesmaid. Yeah. That's

827
00:50:01,485 --> 00:50:03,885
Speaker 3:  the money. I would pay that money. Yeah, absolutely. I just add a bridesmaid

828
00:50:03,885 --> 00:50:04,645
Speaker 3:  to all of my photos.

829
00:50:06,595 --> 00:50:08,805
Speaker 4:  Just a picture of your kid and a bridesmaid

830
00:50:09,455 --> 00:50:13,365
Speaker 3:  There. She's good. Different one every time Who thought,

831
00:50:13,365 --> 00:50:16,845
Speaker 3:  yeah, let's go for it. Yeah. The, you know, there are professional

832
00:50:16,845 --> 00:50:20,685
Speaker 3:  photographers right now who have basically pushed meta into changing the

833
00:50:20,795 --> 00:50:24,765
Speaker 3:  made with AI label that they're putting on Instagram. So you

834
00:50:24,765 --> 00:50:28,525
Speaker 3:  would export a photo from Lightroom or Photoshop, it would take some metadata

835
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:32,485
Speaker 3:  that's like used AI to edit this image. They would put it on Instagram, and

836
00:50:32,485 --> 00:50:36,125
Speaker 3:  Instagram would ha like add a label that was like made with AI

837
00:50:36,355 --> 00:50:39,885
Speaker 3:  when maybe all they had done was the deno or maybe all they had done is like

838
00:50:39,925 --> 00:50:43,845
Speaker 3:  a little generative fill or something. Like some thing that is

839
00:50:44,005 --> 00:50:47,965
Speaker 3:  becoming very commonplace where the photographers were like, no, this image

840
00:50:48,025 --> 00:50:51,765
Speaker 3:  is not generated with ai. I edited it with

841
00:50:51,865 --> 00:50:55,045
Speaker 3:  AI and that is meaningfully different when I communicate with the audience.

842
00:50:55,305 --> 00:50:58,365
Speaker 3:  And meta was like, yeah, we agree with you. That's weird. And we're just

843
00:50:58,365 --> 00:51:02,205
Speaker 3:  at a place where actually we might need 50 labels

844
00:51:03,425 --> 00:51:06,525
Speaker 3:  to explain to people what all the different things You can do.

845
00:51:06,925 --> 00:51:08,605
Speaker 3:  Upscaled in camera with ai.

846
00:51:09,675 --> 00:51:09,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

847
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:10,885
Speaker 3:  Is that bride's,

848
00:51:10,885 --> 00:51:11,165
Speaker 4:  Brides

849
00:51:11,165 --> 00:51:14,805
Speaker 3:  Made added bridesmaid added, right. Versus I typed a prompt

850
00:51:14,985 --> 00:51:17,165
Speaker 3:  and now here's a picture. Right? Yeah.

851
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,245
Speaker 5:  Which is a's a perfect

852
00:51:18,245 --> 00:51:19,365
Speaker 3:  Segue of possibilities.

853
00:51:19,515 --> 00:51:23,005
Speaker 5:  It's a perfect segue into the Samsung thing that Allison Johnson wrote about

854
00:51:23,005 --> 00:51:23,285
Speaker 5:  this week.

855
00:51:23,505 --> 00:51:26,765
Speaker 4:  It rules I. love it so much. It's so stupid.

856
00:51:27,395 --> 00:51:31,245
Speaker 3:  This is the most Samsung caution to the goddamn

857
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:35,485
Speaker 3:  wind. Yes. I can't tell if I am mad about this

858
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:38,245
Speaker 3:  or impressed or whatever. I

859
00:51:38,245 --> 00:51:41,965
Speaker 4:  Was, I was mad about it reading it until you get to where like,

860
00:51:42,305 --> 00:51:45,485
Speaker 4:  she tried to make the Lochness monster come out of a lake and instead it

861
00:51:45,485 --> 00:51:49,245
Speaker 4:  was just a giant green bear with like super shredded

862
00:51:49,245 --> 00:51:53,205
Speaker 4:  green bear. And she tried to pick, make like the pope as

863
00:51:53,245 --> 00:51:56,045
Speaker 4:  a rabbit. Like she took a photo of a rabbit and tried to be like, make this

864
00:51:56,045 --> 00:51:58,805
Speaker 4:  the pope in a popemobile. and it was just like, we're gonna put a giant rabbit

865
00:51:58,875 --> 00:52:00,085
Speaker 4:  head inside a car.

866
00:52:00,715 --> 00:52:02,845
Speaker 5:  Okay. So just to, just to quickly explain what's going on here.

867
00:52:02,855 --> 00:52:06,525
Speaker 3:  Sorry. Samsung's image generation software having stroke is bizarrely woke.

868
00:52:06,525 --> 00:52:10,045
Speaker 3:  We, yeah. The wokeness has

869
00:52:10,325 --> 00:52:14,205
Speaker 3:  infected Samsung galaxy folds and it will not

870
00:52:14,205 --> 00:52:15,285
Speaker 3:  let you generate the poke.

871
00:52:16,585 --> 00:52:17,645
Speaker 5:  That's probably it. Yeah.

872
00:52:19,225 --> 00:52:23,205
Speaker 5:  The Alison Johnson is testing Samsung's new phones, the flip six

873
00:52:23,205 --> 00:52:25,885
Speaker 5:  and the fold six. Nobody listened to what Neli is saying. It's very important

874
00:52:25,885 --> 00:52:29,645
Speaker 5:  that you never listen to what Neli says. And I think the

875
00:52:29,755 --> 00:52:33,685
Speaker 5:  fold six has a feature called sketch to image, which is You can You

876
00:52:33,685 --> 00:52:36,125
Speaker 5:  can take a photo draw

877
00:52:36,985 --> 00:52:37,405
Speaker 3:  Pretty

878
00:52:37,555 --> 00:52:41,285
Speaker 5:  Crudely, a thing you want on that photo and it will generate that thing

879
00:52:41,915 --> 00:52:45,725
Speaker 5:  onto your photo. So I think the first one I saw her do was, it's a,

880
00:52:45,725 --> 00:52:49,525
Speaker 5:  it's a picture of like a, a harbor with a port and some

881
00:52:49,525 --> 00:52:53,085
Speaker 5:  flowers in the foreground. And she draws this like adorable little

882
00:52:53,555 --> 00:52:57,405
Speaker 5:  cartoon bee and I, I guess prompts it

883
00:52:57,585 --> 00:52:59,685
Speaker 5:  to be out of focus and

884
00:52:59,825 --> 00:53:00,765
Speaker 4:  No, she didn't prompt it.

885
00:53:00,945 --> 00:53:03,885
Speaker 5:  Oh, she didn't prompt it. Oh wow. She didn't prompt it. She give a B. She

886
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:06,725
Speaker 5:  just drew a B. Yeah. Oh, and she put it on a part of the photo that's out

887
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:10,445
Speaker 5:  of focus. Yeah. And so it generated an out of focus B in that spot

888
00:53:10,545 --> 00:53:14,045
Speaker 5:  in the photo And. if you just look at the photo, there is not a single chance

889
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:17,205
Speaker 5:  in hell. You would think that that B was not part

890
00:53:17,545 --> 00:53:21,485
Speaker 3:  Of the photo. There is an, there's a tiny little watermark in gray and

891
00:53:21,485 --> 00:53:23,965
Speaker 3:  the bottom left that says AI generated content

892
00:53:24,225 --> 00:53:25,005
Speaker 4:  If you squint.

893
00:53:26,365 --> 00:53:29,245
Speaker 5:  I literally, I had, I have looked at this photo a hundred times. I hadn't

894
00:53:29,245 --> 00:53:29,925
Speaker 5:  seen that until just now.

895
00:53:29,995 --> 00:53:32,085
Speaker 3:  It's pointed out. Yeah. It's, it is Samsung being like,

896
00:53:34,235 --> 00:53:38,205
Speaker 3:  this is what I mean. I can't tell if I'm upset or I'm just impressed at the

897
00:53:38,955 --> 00:53:42,845
Speaker 3:  fuck it like Yeah, like let's just do different disinformation.

898
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:46,125
Speaker 3:  Would you like to draw some, some disinformation? Not the pope, sir, but

899
00:53:46,125 --> 00:53:47,045
Speaker 3:  any other thing is fine.

900
00:53:48,865 --> 00:53:52,725
Speaker 3:  and it, it is crazy. Like she go look at the pictures in the, in the article

901
00:53:52,725 --> 00:53:56,525
Speaker 3:  that she put a ship in a harbor. It is true that she's, the bear

902
00:53:56,585 --> 00:54:00,205
Speaker 3:  is very good. I mean, fair. She's got a hat on a bunny.

903
00:54:01,505 --> 00:54:04,245
Speaker 3:  And then the water, if you look at the, at the picture of the, the, the hat

904
00:54:04,245 --> 00:54:08,045
Speaker 3:  on the bunny, the watermark is invisible. Yeah. It's there. It just totally

905
00:54:08,285 --> 00:54:12,205
Speaker 3:  bl blended in the grass. And Samsung is like, why wouldn't you just

906
00:54:12,205 --> 00:54:15,365
Speaker 3:  make that bigger for people? You also, you just crop it out. It's not in

907
00:54:15,365 --> 00:54:19,045
Speaker 3:  the photo. Right. This is what I mean by the, what is a photo

908
00:54:19,225 --> 00:54:22,925
Speaker 3:  apo? Like this is full. What is a photo apocalypse? So you are giving

909
00:54:22,925 --> 00:54:26,685
Speaker 3:  people the tool to just generate fake imagery based on real imagery

910
00:54:26,865 --> 00:54:30,085
Speaker 3:  and then send it out into the world with nothing with

911
00:54:30,755 --> 00:54:34,285
Speaker 3:  They can just lie. And like, we're gonna get to a place, I think

912
00:54:34,635 --> 00:54:38,405
Speaker 3:  more quickly than people want to, where

913
00:54:38,505 --> 00:54:42,405
Speaker 3:  no one trusts any image and then we're gonna have to work backwards from

914
00:54:42,405 --> 00:54:46,005
Speaker 3:  there. Or the alternative, which is

915
00:54:46,675 --> 00:54:50,605
Speaker 3:  very scary, where everyone trusts every image. There's not

916
00:54:50,605 --> 00:54:52,085
Speaker 3:  gonna be like some middle ground, right? Like

917
00:54:52,435 --> 00:54:55,485
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I don't think the middle ground exists. You either just say, oh sure,

918
00:54:55,485 --> 00:54:59,045
Speaker 5:  it's probably all real, and let the chips fall where they may. Or you trust

919
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:03,005
Speaker 5:  nothing. Yeah. And trusting nothing requires a lot more work. And, and

920
00:55:03,005 --> 00:55:06,085
Speaker 5:  so I think it's, it's actually easier to just say, oh sure, it's probably

921
00:55:06,085 --> 00:55:09,965
Speaker 5:  real and I'll be wrong sometimes. And that's fine. And I, I think like nihilism

922
00:55:09,965 --> 00:55:12,565
Speaker 5:  kind of leads you there in a way that's pretty scary. Yeah.

923
00:55:12,605 --> 00:55:16,245
Speaker 4:  I just, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna reserve my judgment on how, how

924
00:55:16,245 --> 00:55:19,645
Speaker 4:  panicked to be about this until we find out like if You can just draw abs

925
00:55:19,645 --> 00:55:21,285
Speaker 4:  on someone and it gives them abs,

926
00:55:22,705 --> 00:55:23,885
Speaker 5:  In which case you'd be pro,

927
00:55:24,985 --> 00:55:28,005
Speaker 4:  I'd probably be con. 'cause I don't wanna see a bunch of like, I want the

928
00:55:28,065 --> 00:55:31,725
Speaker 4:  abs to be real. Mm. Like don't, don't fake no fake abs here. Only real

929
00:55:31,905 --> 00:55:34,565
Speaker 4:  abs. So, so I'm, I'm very curious to see. I ask Alex, it's

930
00:55:34,565 --> 00:55:37,445
Speaker 5:  To have moral boundaries. Crans. Yeah. I appreciate that about you. Yeah.

931
00:55:38,255 --> 00:55:41,285
Speaker 4:  Small six, six pack of a moral boundaries. Everybody's gotta

932
00:55:41,285 --> 00:55:42,605
Speaker 3:  Have line. So it,

933
00:55:45,665 --> 00:55:49,285
Speaker 3:  And that moral boundary is shredded abs. That's it. Don't,

934
00:55:49,375 --> 00:55:52,885
Speaker 3:  don't fake me out wash water. Nothing. So

935
00:55:53,565 --> 00:55:57,405
Speaker 3:  interestingly, Samsung is not doing this locally. The picture

936
00:55:57,405 --> 00:56:00,325
Speaker 3:  gets sent out to the cloud, which is where some of the content moderation

937
00:56:00,325 --> 00:56:04,085
Speaker 3:  seems to come in, right? Like once you go away from your phone and into a

938
00:56:04,085 --> 00:56:07,525
Speaker 3:  cloud server, everyone wants to take responsibility for it, which is good.

939
00:56:07,525 --> 00:56:11,285
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Tech companies taking responsibility, unclear how long it will

940
00:56:11,755 --> 00:56:14,645
Speaker 3:  take over time. You know, these, these systems aren't being stressed yet.

941
00:56:15,635 --> 00:56:19,325
Speaker 3:  Well, data usage, power usage, all this stuff. But

942
00:56:19,425 --> 00:56:23,365
Speaker 3:  boy did Samsung just be like, fine, just draw on the photo and like we'll

943
00:56:23,365 --> 00:56:24,405
Speaker 3:  just make a fake photo for you.

944
00:56:24,405 --> 00:56:27,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You want the Lochness monster. Have the Lochness Monster or a Green

945
00:56:27,325 --> 00:56:28,445
Speaker 5:  Bear. Or a green bear.

946
00:56:29,465 --> 00:56:33,325
Speaker 3:  All right. Is this, if you're calling it the, is this anything gadget Bonanza?

947
00:56:33,865 --> 00:56:34,565
Speaker 3:  is this anything?

948
00:56:35,795 --> 00:56:39,525
Speaker 5:  This is something, yeah, I don't know what, but it is something, but I would

949
00:56:39,525 --> 00:56:43,365
Speaker 5:  like to, I would like to segue to one that is the most, is this

950
00:56:43,645 --> 00:56:47,565
Speaker 5:  anything of anything, which is that years after essential,

951
00:56:47,745 --> 00:56:51,485
Speaker 5:  the, the once promising Andy Rubin led phone

952
00:56:51,485 --> 00:56:55,245
Speaker 5:  company went away. We finally are starting

953
00:56:55,265 --> 00:56:59,165
Speaker 5:  to get information about the second thing they were building. There was a

954
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:02,765
Speaker 5:  lot of like, I think at the time we saw like

955
00:57:02,875 --> 00:57:06,285
Speaker 5:  renders of this very tall sort of remote controlee lookin phone,

956
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:11,045
Speaker 5:  but somebody found one on eBay and got a hands-on.

957
00:57:12,725 --> 00:57:15,365
Speaker 5:  I think this is the most interesting phone I've seen in years. and it also

958
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:17,725
Speaker 5:  might be so stupid. It

959
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:18,165
Speaker 3:  Looks so

960
00:57:18,325 --> 00:57:18,565
Speaker 5:  Dumb.

961
00:57:18,915 --> 00:57:22,845
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I I love stupid tech, so I'm just, I adore this thing.

962
00:57:23,525 --> 00:57:25,605
Speaker 4:  I don't understand how you would use it long term.

963
00:57:26,515 --> 00:57:30,365
Speaker 5:  It's basically the best way I can describe it is like, imagine two iPod nanos

964
00:57:30,475 --> 00:57:34,405
Speaker 5:  stacked on top of each other. Yeah. But it's all screen. It's just a,

965
00:57:34,405 --> 00:57:38,085
Speaker 5:  it's just a remote control and it looks like it's basically just a bunch

966
00:57:38,085 --> 00:57:42,045
Speaker 5:  of widgets, which perhaps unsurprisingly makes me very

967
00:57:42,045 --> 00:57:44,285
Speaker 5:  excited. I love a good widget. I

968
00:57:44,365 --> 00:57:48,085
Speaker 4:  I think that my, my big call out for this one is that it was obviously

969
00:57:48,085 --> 00:57:49,565
Speaker 4:  made before TikTok was a thing.

970
00:57:50,185 --> 00:57:52,805
Speaker 5:  No, but on this you could open TikTok on the bottom and then TikTok again

971
00:57:52,865 --> 00:57:53,325
Speaker 5:  on the top

972
00:57:54,025 --> 00:57:55,245
Speaker 4:  Little tiny TikTok.

973
00:57:55,475 --> 00:57:59,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it would be dope. I could make a TikTok and

974
00:57:59,325 --> 00:58:01,285
Speaker 5:  watch a TikTok all at exactly the same time. I

975
00:58:01,285 --> 00:58:03,845
Speaker 4:  Bet it would be really good for fidgeting. Like, just kind of flipping it

976
00:58:03,845 --> 00:58:07,245
Speaker 4:  around in your hand, the, the whole phone. 'cause it's so long.

977
00:58:08,345 --> 00:58:12,205
Speaker 3:  That's true. Like a pencil, if you'll recall, essentials plan

978
00:58:12,345 --> 00:58:16,005
Speaker 3:  was to do ambient computing. They were gonna put stuff in your house. The

979
00:58:16,005 --> 00:58:19,325
Speaker 3:  phone was just the first thing. So maybe this really was just a remote control.

980
00:58:19,505 --> 00:58:19,725
Speaker 3:  Mm.

981
00:58:20,225 --> 00:58:23,685
Speaker 5:  That's very possible. Yeah. That it was like they, they were making a, a

982
00:58:23,715 --> 00:58:26,765
Speaker 5:  home device. I wrote a whole thing about this when, back when I was at Wired

983
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:29,885
Speaker 5:  that they were, their big plan was like you said, to have,

984
00:58:30,915 --> 00:58:34,245
Speaker 5:  they were doing sort of an Alexa thing, but we're promising to do it in a

985
00:58:34,245 --> 00:58:37,565
Speaker 5:  much more elegant way. And even just looking at some of the stuff here, it

986
00:58:37,565 --> 00:58:41,245
Speaker 5:  is very much like get quick information and

987
00:58:41,345 --> 00:58:44,765
Speaker 5:  see what's going on rather than like endlessly scroll on Instagram.

988
00:58:45,175 --> 00:58:48,805
Speaker 5:  Which like, I'd take that, that that works. But I just, I miss

989
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:52,965
Speaker 5:  this thing where there were people asking questions about what size a phone

990
00:58:52,965 --> 00:58:56,725
Speaker 5:  was supposed to be and now no. We're, we've just decided that phones should

991
00:58:56,725 --> 00:58:59,805
Speaker 5:  be huge and leave weird divots in your pinky from trying to hold them. Yeah.

992
00:58:59,805 --> 00:59:01,205
Speaker 3:  I'm gonna say this isn't anything.

993
00:59:01,555 --> 00:59:05,245
Speaker 5:  Okay. Yeah, you're right. Sorry. Well, objectively co

994
00:59:05,245 --> 00:59:05,485
Speaker 3:  Conclusively not

995
00:59:05,725 --> 00:59:06,085
Speaker 5:  Anything. Yeah.

996
00:59:08,385 --> 00:59:12,285
Speaker 5:  Can I, can I interest you in the tiny, the tiny pot? is this

997
00:59:12,525 --> 00:59:12,645
Speaker 5:  anything?

998
00:59:13,235 --> 00:59:14,765
Speaker 4:  Okay. Which one? Which one? Let

999
00:59:14,765 --> 00:59:18,565
Speaker 5:  Me, let me back this up instead. Can I interest

1000
00:59:18,565 --> 00:59:22,365
Speaker 5:  you in a little silicon case for your Apple watch that gives

1001
00:59:22,365 --> 00:59:26,005
Speaker 5:  it a scroll wheel that appears to just mechanically move the digital crown?

1002
00:59:26,345 --> 00:59:26,565
Speaker 5:  Yes.

1003
00:59:26,715 --> 00:59:27,005
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

1004
00:59:27,165 --> 00:59:27,365
Speaker 4:  Very

1005
00:59:27,365 --> 00:59:28,845
Speaker 3:  Good. I mean, perfect.

1006
00:59:29,885 --> 00:59:31,005
Speaker 4:  I wish it wasn't $80.

1007
00:59:32,265 --> 00:59:35,085
Speaker 3:  No, that's the right price. You wish it was more That's the price of hubris.

1008
00:59:37,315 --> 00:59:39,805
Speaker 4:  They have a version without the wheel for like $30.

1009
00:59:40,105 --> 00:59:41,165
Speaker 3:  Oh, come on. And I'm

1010
00:59:41,165 --> 00:59:43,845
Speaker 4:  Just like, what's the point of that? Who's, who wants that?

1011
00:59:44,595 --> 00:59:47,325
Speaker 3:  Okay. So I will just remind everyone that when the Apple Watch was launched,

1012
00:59:47,325 --> 00:59:51,245
Speaker 3:  You can go back and watch this video. Bono was there. They,

1013
00:59:51,355 --> 00:59:54,965
Speaker 3:  they built a tent at a community college in California. This is a real thing

1014
00:59:54,965 --> 00:59:58,045
Speaker 3:  that happened and they sat us all down

1015
00:59:58,905 --> 01:00:02,885
Speaker 3:  and they were like, with every new Apple product comes a revolutionary

1016
01:00:02,885 --> 01:00:06,845
Speaker 3:  input device. You'll recall the mouse, here's Steve Jobs and a mouse.

1017
01:00:06,985 --> 01:00:10,805
Speaker 3:  You'll recall the, the click wheel on the iPod, the Multitouch

1018
01:00:11,625 --> 01:00:15,485
Speaker 3:  on the iPhone. And now with the Apple watch, the digital Crown.

1019
01:00:16,185 --> 01:00:20,125
Speaker 3:  And I just think a device that's like no actually click wheel. What if

1020
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:23,885
Speaker 3:  we just use a click wheel to turn the digital account is perfect. I will

1021
01:00:23,885 --> 01:00:25,085
Speaker 3:  pay $80 just for that.

1022
01:00:26,505 --> 01:00:27,605
Speaker 4:  Are you gonna put your watch in it?

1023
01:00:29,805 --> 01:00:33,245
Speaker 3:  I mean, I, I have so many old Apple watchOS, I'd be like, can shovel in here?

1024
01:00:33,625 --> 01:00:37,365
Speaker 3:  It does look delightful. I don't know why they've exposed the heart rate

1025
01:00:37,635 --> 01:00:41,045
Speaker 3:  sensors on the back. You can like, like are you supposed to hold it, press

1026
01:00:41,045 --> 01:00:41,165
Speaker 3:  it

1027
01:00:41,165 --> 01:00:41,605
Speaker 5:  To your neck?

1028
01:00:41,755 --> 01:00:42,045
Speaker 3:  Like

1029
01:00:44,945 --> 01:00:46,605
Speaker 5:  No. Okay. Wait. I I have one.

1030
01:00:47,145 --> 01:00:48,885
Speaker 3:  Oh, it's for charging. It's for charging. Oh,

1031
01:00:48,885 --> 01:00:49,285
Speaker 5:  Sure. That

1032
01:00:49,285 --> 01:00:50,045
Speaker 4:  Makes sense. That makes more sense.

1033
01:00:50,785 --> 01:00:54,525
Speaker 5:  My, my stupid usability question about this is the

1034
01:00:54,535 --> 01:00:58,485
Speaker 5:  watch, every time you take it off it locks. Like the way it

1035
01:00:58,485 --> 01:01:01,805
Speaker 5:  authenticates is by staying on your body and then you turn it on. Are you

1036
01:01:01,805 --> 01:01:04,885
Speaker 5:  gonna have to enter your passcode every single time you want to touch this

1037
01:01:04,885 --> 01:01:06,565
Speaker 5:  thing? Because that sounds awful. I think

1038
01:01:06,565 --> 01:01:08,525
Speaker 4:  You, you used to be able to dis disable.

1039
01:01:08,745 --> 01:01:10,045
Speaker 5:  Can you turn that off? Okay. Yeah.

1040
01:01:10,105 --> 01:01:13,365
Speaker 4:  You should be able to turn the watch stuff off. I never do

1041
01:01:13,365 --> 01:01:15,325
Speaker 5:  This. Okay. If that's the case, I'm gonna buy the hell outta this thing.

1042
01:01:16,595 --> 01:01:20,125
Speaker 5:  Also, it will decimate the battery life because you are absolutely not supposed

1043
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:24,045
Speaker 5:  to actively use the watch very much. But I don't care. I'm gonna use it.

1044
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:25,285
Speaker 4:  Do, yeah.

1045
01:01:25,675 --> 01:01:28,845
Speaker 3:  Okay. This is something. Love it. Go. I'll say that the between the weird

1046
01:01:29,365 --> 01:01:33,085
Speaker 3:  b Palmer news cycle that you and Craig might have kicked off

1047
01:01:33,545 --> 01:01:36,645
Speaker 3:  and the, the, the interest in the, these things.

1048
01:01:37,755 --> 01:01:40,285
Speaker 3:  Some something's happening out there. I dunno what it is. I dunno if it's

1049
01:01:40,285 --> 01:01:42,885
Speaker 3:  measurable. I dunno if anyone's actually giving up their phone, but people

1050
01:01:42,905 --> 01:01:46,765
Speaker 3:  are very much like, I'm sick of these rectangles. What do I think?

1051
01:01:46,785 --> 01:01:47,965
Speaker 3:  Dumber worse. Rectangles.

1052
01:01:47,965 --> 01:01:51,445
Speaker 5:  There is a, there is a moment of phone

1053
01:01:51,745 --> 01:01:54,605
Speaker 5:  disintermediation that is happening that I think is very exciting.

1054
01:01:56,975 --> 01:02:00,965
Speaker 5:  Let's see. Oh gosh, there's so many. Let's do the Dyson on track

1055
01:02:01,015 --> 01:02:01,685
Speaker 5:  headphones.

1056
01:02:01,995 --> 01:02:02,445
Speaker 3:  This is

1057
01:02:02,445 --> 01:02:04,885
Speaker 5:  Nothing. That's the first time I've said that name out loud. I don't like

1058
01:02:04,885 --> 01:02:06,765
Speaker 5:  it. It's not on track. The on track on track. Bad,

1059
01:02:07,185 --> 01:02:10,565
Speaker 3:  Bad. They're very, they're Dyson made very customizable headphones. That's

1060
01:02:10,565 --> 01:02:12,125
Speaker 3:  cool. I'm, I'm super down. And

1061
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:14,565
Speaker 5:  They don't look like a band mask, which I would argue is a tremendous

1062
01:02:14,565 --> 01:02:16,285
Speaker 4:  Improvement and, and they cost $500

1063
01:02:16,635 --> 01:02:18,285
Speaker 5:  Less improvement. Yeah. Not as

1064
01:02:18,285 --> 01:02:22,085
Speaker 4:  Good. Yeah, I, well really curious to see how they, they

1065
01:02:22,195 --> 01:02:25,885
Speaker 4:  work out. I know Chris Welch is gonna probably review 'em, call 'em in, but

1066
01:02:26,955 --> 01:02:27,245
Speaker 4:  yeah,

1067
01:02:27,315 --> 01:02:29,765
Speaker 3:  They do look cool. They're just expensive. Did the

1068
01:02:29,765 --> 01:02:31,325
Speaker 5:  Band one sound good? I don't remember.

1069
01:02:31,395 --> 01:02:35,325
Speaker 4:  They sounded okay. Okay. But this is giving real skull candy and

1070
01:02:35,325 --> 01:02:39,165
Speaker 4:  I don't know if that's a derogatory skull candy or a pos, it's just skull

1071
01:02:39,165 --> 01:02:39,445
Speaker 4:  candy.

1072
01:02:39,635 --> 01:02:43,285
Speaker 5:  It's a little derogatory for $500. It's derogatory. Yeah.

1073
01:02:44,765 --> 01:02:48,285
Speaker 3:  I think my issue with these and I, you know, I know people lo love Dyson

1074
01:02:48,285 --> 01:02:51,605
Speaker 3:  products. I just wanna sit on an airplane with headphones and say Dyson on

1075
01:02:51,605 --> 01:02:52,285
Speaker 3:  them in this way.

1076
01:02:52,715 --> 01:02:56,005
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Also there's no fan. Where is the fan? Yeah.

1077
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:58,765
Speaker 3:  You've got spin spinning. You've got one core technology Dyson.

1078
01:02:59,435 --> 01:02:59,725
Speaker 4:  Gosh.

1079
01:03:01,635 --> 01:03:04,325
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Okay. I wanna, maybe there's something, but I don't think there are

1080
01:03:04,445 --> 01:03:05,125
Speaker 3:  anything. So the

1081
01:03:05,125 --> 01:03:09,085
Speaker 5:  Way you just said Neli Dyson in this way, it makes me think you

1082
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:12,045
Speaker 5:  like bring your vacuum on the plane and you're like, happy to show that off.

1083
01:03:12,145 --> 01:03:13,845
Speaker 5:  But you don't wanna rep Dyson in this way.

1084
01:03:14,465 --> 01:03:17,245
Speaker 3:  That's what I'm saying. It's a, it's a very confus,

1085
01:03:17,245 --> 01:03:19,645
Speaker 5:  You're like with this air wrap style and they're just like killing it on

1086
01:03:19,645 --> 01:03:19,685
Speaker 5:  the

1087
01:03:19,685 --> 01:03:23,485
Speaker 3:  Plane. If you sat down on an airplane, I dunno. And you like opened a

1088
01:03:23,485 --> 01:03:26,645
Speaker 3:  box of food and had a Chevy logo, I'd like, what is happening here?

1089
01:03:27,195 --> 01:03:28,405
Speaker 3:  This makes no sense.

1090
01:03:29,355 --> 01:03:30,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I can give you that.

1091
01:03:30,325 --> 01:03:31,525
Speaker 4:  Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.

1092
01:03:31,965 --> 01:03:35,925
Speaker 5:  I think Dyson just had a bunch of headphone parts left and just

1093
01:03:35,925 --> 01:03:39,765
Speaker 5:  shipped them. That's my theory. The let's do last one

1094
01:03:39,765 --> 01:03:42,645
Speaker 5:  and then there I have, I have more. I have, we could do this forever, but

1095
01:03:42,645 --> 01:03:46,485
Speaker 5:  let's just do one last one and then we should go. And I think it is the most,

1096
01:03:46,585 --> 01:03:49,365
Speaker 5:  is this anything of all the major phone companies right now? and it's that

1097
01:03:49,365 --> 01:03:52,885
Speaker 5:  Google just leaked its own Pixel nine. Yeah. Yeah. Google was just like,

1098
01:03:52,885 --> 01:03:55,325
Speaker 5:  here's the Pixel nine pro. is this anything

1099
01:03:57,165 --> 01:03:58,325
Speaker 4:  I like They asked, I

1100
01:03:58,325 --> 01:04:01,805
Speaker 5:  Don't know. That should be the title of the YouTube video. They're like,

1101
01:04:01,805 --> 01:04:02,805
Speaker 5:  do do you like this? Well

1102
01:04:02,805 --> 01:04:04,325
Speaker 4:  They did this, was it last year?

1103
01:04:06,225 --> 01:04:09,245
Speaker 4:  Was it last year that they leaked the pixel? Like where

1104
01:04:09,505 --> 01:04:12,205
Speaker 3:  Is this just a leak? Can we stop calling this a leak? They just posted it.

1105
01:04:12,235 --> 01:04:13,485
Speaker 5:  They just posted the phone. Yeah,

1106
01:04:13,485 --> 01:04:16,045
Speaker 3:  That's true. I mean like a high res photo. They're like, here it is.

1107
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:20,525
Speaker 5:  They did a video that just says introducing the Google Pixel nine Pro. You're

1108
01:04:20,525 --> 01:04:21,645
Speaker 5:  right. They just launched the damn phone

1109
01:04:21,645 --> 01:04:22,525
Speaker 3:  Stop. That's not a

1110
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:23,845
Speaker 5:  Leak. You're absolutely right. Yeah.

1111
01:04:24,115 --> 01:04:26,485
Speaker 4:  They just were like, here it is for now.

1112
01:04:27,185 --> 01:04:31,125
Speaker 3:  It the camera bump is outrageous. It's huge. What are

1113
01:04:31,125 --> 01:04:31,725
Speaker 3:  we doing guys?

1114
01:04:32,395 --> 01:04:32,885
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I

1115
01:04:33,105 --> 01:04:35,925
Speaker 3:  The the camera bump is like starting to be the size of a phone

1116
01:04:37,795 --> 01:04:41,405
Speaker 3:  like that. The little i i Apple What's the Apple Watch phone called?

1117
01:04:41,915 --> 01:04:43,245
Speaker 5:  Wait, tiny pod. The,

1118
01:04:43,245 --> 01:04:47,125
Speaker 3:  Yeah, the tiny pod. I am I'm curious if the tiny pod with the Apple watch

1119
01:04:47,125 --> 01:04:49,085
Speaker 3:  in it is as big as the bump on the,

1120
01:04:49,195 --> 01:04:52,125
Speaker 5:  Okay, so pixel 10, you make the bump removable.

1121
01:04:52,505 --> 01:04:53,045
Speaker 4:  That's what

1122
01:04:53,045 --> 01:04:55,485
Speaker 5:  I was gonna say. And it's its own thing. Yeah. Now we're talking crazy. Yeah.

1123
01:04:55,485 --> 01:04:57,325
Speaker 4:  See what I'm saying? We did. Now we're talking. That's the good stuff.

1124
01:04:58,265 --> 01:05:01,525
Speaker 5:  We just did it. It's really like the whole story of this thing is going to

1125
01:05:01,525 --> 01:05:05,445
Speaker 5:  be, it runs Gemini fast. It's like, it's very clear.

1126
01:05:05,445 --> 01:05:06,805
Speaker 5:  That is the whole sales pitch here.

1127
01:05:07,275 --> 01:05:09,125
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Which, what else does Google has? I,

1128
01:05:09,205 --> 01:05:09,805
Speaker 5:  I do not find that.

1129
01:05:09,905 --> 01:05:13,845
Speaker 3:  Do people want this? But I am not convinced Gemini's doing

1130
01:05:13,845 --> 01:05:16,405
Speaker 3:  all the things Google wants to do. We'll, we'll get to that later. But if

1131
01:05:16,405 --> 01:05:20,365
Speaker 3:  that's the whole pitch here, it has to be good. And what have we learned

1132
01:05:20,365 --> 01:05:24,325
Speaker 3:  about AI hardware? It's probably broken and I don't

1133
01:05:24,325 --> 01:05:24,725
Speaker 3:  believe you.

1134
01:05:27,265 --> 01:05:30,685
Speaker 5:  So yeah, we're gonna say that launch is August 13th,

1135
01:05:30,935 --> 01:05:31,285
Speaker 5:  right?

1136
01:05:33,065 --> 01:05:36,685
Speaker 5:  So TBD But I'm gonna, I'm gonna say tentatively it is not

1137
01:05:36,965 --> 01:05:40,805
Speaker 5:  anything. We should take a break. But the last

1138
01:05:40,825 --> 01:05:44,405
Speaker 5:  one is the The OnePlus Pad two has a vibrating stylus

1139
01:05:46,345 --> 01:05:46,845
Speaker 5:  for reasons.

1140
01:05:47,995 --> 01:05:48,805
Speaker 3:  This is another thing.

1141
01:05:50,115 --> 01:05:53,165
Speaker 4:  Okay. You know what the, you're writing utensil to vibrate

1142
01:05:54,525 --> 01:05:54,645
Speaker 3:  A

1143
01:05:54,645 --> 01:05:57,445
Speaker 5:  Linear motor inside that makes the tip vibrate to give you that

1144
01:08:15,285 --> 01:08:16,565
Speaker 3:  break dancing. Yeah.

1145
01:08:16,935 --> 01:08:19,685
Speaker 5:  Which is to be fair, kind of jumping and and and yeah.

1146
01:08:19,935 --> 01:08:23,925
Speaker 3:  Every Olympic sport is one of those three. Jumping, flipping and swimming.

1147
01:08:27,745 --> 01:08:31,325
Speaker 3:  As you know, sports in America are basically in seven 20 p and have been

1148
01:08:31,325 --> 01:08:34,925
Speaker 3:  forever because there's no competition for broadcast. Comcast

1149
01:08:35,185 --> 01:08:37,325
Speaker 3:  is going to do the Olympics in 4K,

1150
01:08:39,545 --> 01:08:43,205
Speaker 3:  but they're only gonna do it. Comcast is gonna do the Olympics in 4K, probably

1151
01:08:43,205 --> 01:08:46,605
Speaker 3:  in Peacock, but probably like the horrible upscaled 4K that they do.

1152
01:08:47,985 --> 01:08:51,765
Speaker 3:  If you have a Comcast cable box, you will get

1153
01:08:51,885 --> 01:08:54,685
Speaker 3:  a high bit rate, low latency 4K feet of the Olympics.

1154
01:08:55,035 --> 01:08:55,325
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1155
01:08:56,145 --> 01:09:00,005
Speaker 3:  So if you have an A XI six A

1156
01:09:00,105 --> 01:09:04,005
Speaker 3:  she six, I don't know what kind of cable box that is because I live

1157
01:09:04,115 --> 01:09:08,045
Speaker 3:  here in the future. But if you have one of their cable boxes,

1158
01:09:09,305 --> 01:09:12,965
Speaker 3:  You can get Hi-Fi audio and a 30 megabits per second

1159
01:09:13,105 --> 01:09:16,445
Speaker 3:  low latency 4K stream of the Olympics. Which sounds awesome,

1160
01:09:17,555 --> 01:09:20,645
Speaker 3:  frankly. That sounds awesome. Yeah. It is just ridiculous that they're eliminated

1161
01:09:20,645 --> 01:09:23,245
Speaker 3:  to their K walks, which they say they have to do because of their custom

1162
01:09:23,245 --> 01:09:25,485
Speaker 3:  network, blah, blah blah, blah. There's absolutely no reason they have to

1163
01:09:25,485 --> 01:09:26,725
Speaker 3:  do this. Right? Yeah.

1164
01:09:26,725 --> 01:09:30,365
Speaker 4:  What, why didn't they put those resources into Peacock and letting Peacock

1165
01:09:30,385 --> 01:09:30,765
Speaker 4:  do it?

1166
01:09:31,205 --> 01:09:35,125
Speaker 5:  I will say this is going to work for Comcast. Like the obvious move

1167
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:38,965
Speaker 5:  here is to get people who don't have this box but have a

1168
01:09:38,965 --> 01:09:42,605
Speaker 5:  Comcast account to upgrade to this box. And it's gonna work

1169
01:09:42,875 --> 01:09:46,205
Speaker 5:  like the, the sporting events that make people go out and buy new

1170
01:09:46,545 --> 01:09:50,125
Speaker 5:  higher res televisions. Like it, it's the same

1171
01:09:50,355 --> 01:09:51,405
Speaker 5:  push it's gonna work.

1172
01:09:51,825 --> 01:09:54,125
Speaker 4:  Are the Olympics that Yeah, dude,

1173
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:56,365
Speaker 5:  It's the Olympics. The Olympics are huge

1174
01:09:57,315 --> 01:09:57,925
Speaker 4:  Sometimes.

1175
01:09:58,545 --> 01:10:01,885
Speaker 3:  So you get W Vision, HDR and Atmos immersive sound

1176
01:10:02,545 --> 01:10:05,805
Speaker 3:  and then Yep. Channel 1350, which is USA 4K

1177
01:10:06,925 --> 01:10:07,525
Speaker 3:  will get the

1178
01:10:07,555 --> 01:10:11,485
Speaker 5:  Wait. It's just the one channel. It's not all of the Olympics. It's just

1179
01:10:11,685 --> 01:10:12,205
Speaker 5:  USA

1180
01:10:12,745 --> 01:10:14,245
Speaker 3:  And Yep. And then four. So you, you get

1181
01:10:14,245 --> 01:10:17,405
Speaker 5:  The Olympics and Mon reruns. Yes. Congrats.

1182
01:10:18,625 --> 01:10:21,485
Speaker 3:  Yes. It's, it's 24 7 access to the national screen.

1183
01:10:22,425 --> 01:10:23,525
Speaker 3:  The national stream.

1184
01:10:23,745 --> 01:10:25,285
Speaker 5:  Oh, that's worse. I take it back.

1185
01:10:25,475 --> 01:10:26,365
Speaker 4:  Nevermind. Yeah,

1186
01:10:27,435 --> 01:10:27,925
Speaker 5:  Peacock

1187
01:10:28,075 --> 01:10:31,325
Speaker 4:  Just peacock's gonna like peacock. They seem to have been doing a really

1188
01:10:31,855 --> 01:10:32,965
Speaker 4:  smart design for it.

1189
01:10:33,165 --> 01:10:36,325
Speaker 5:  I got an email this morning telling me that my peacock price is about to

1190
01:10:36,325 --> 01:10:40,205
Speaker 5:  go up and guess when my price changes. Oh, it's in the middle of the

1191
01:10:40,525 --> 01:10:40,605
Speaker 5:  Olympics.

1192
01:10:42,285 --> 01:10:44,605
Speaker 5:  Surprise. You can test and see Peacock,

1193
01:10:44,745 --> 01:10:48,645
Speaker 4:  See if it like, which is better with or without paid

1194
01:10:48,645 --> 01:10:49,125
Speaker 4:  Peacock.

1195
01:10:50,165 --> 01:10:53,645
Speaker 5:  I, I am required to keep paid Peacock because it somehow has all my shows.

1196
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,405
Speaker 5:  We've talked about this,

1197
01:10:54,595 --> 01:10:56,845
Speaker 4:  This is true. This, I don't know why I, I suggested

1198
01:10:56,845 --> 01:10:59,765
Speaker 5:  That too. Yeah, peacock, I'm sorry, is weirdly like central to my day-to-Day

1199
01:10:59,765 --> 01:11:03,565
Speaker 5:  existence. But I try not to, I try not to think too much about that

1200
01:11:03,685 --> 01:11:04,525
Speaker 5:  'cause it just makes me sad.

1201
01:11:05,105 --> 01:11:07,085
Speaker 4:  You get all the girls five ever though. So

1202
01:11:08,085 --> 01:11:08,605
Speaker 5:  I do like that

1203
01:11:09,385 --> 01:11:12,685
Speaker 3:  If you have a compatible streaming device, you will get W Vision HDR and

1204
01:11:12,975 --> 01:11:16,285
Speaker 3:  Atmos. But you don't, you don't get the, the enhanced 4K.

1205
01:11:17,035 --> 01:11:20,965
Speaker 3:  This is very complicated. Yeah. All I'm saying is Sony Petra core, that

1206
01:11:21,405 --> 01:11:25,245
Speaker 3:  rebranded Sony a Bravia core that I have on, on my Sony tv still

1207
01:11:25,245 --> 01:11:28,605
Speaker 3:  showing me Madame Webb at 80 megabits per second. The finest dream experience

1208
01:11:28,605 --> 01:11:32,085
Speaker 3:  You can have in America today. All Kranz, what's yours?

1209
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:36,725
Speaker 4:  Also 4K related because Sling TV is adding four K streaming

1210
01:11:37,505 --> 01:11:40,725
Speaker 4:  for free, unlike everybody else who has

1211
01:11:41,045 --> 01:11:43,325
Speaker 3:  Charging for it. Where's where? Sling on the go. Nineties sale would you

1212
01:11:43,325 --> 01:11:43,445
Speaker 3:  say

1213
01:11:44,195 --> 01:11:44,805
Speaker 4:  With this?

1214
01:11:45,545 --> 01:11:47,285
Speaker 5:  At least in the seventies. Yeah.

1215
01:11:47,395 --> 01:11:48,925
Speaker 3:  This is like Hail Mary.

1216
01:11:50,245 --> 01:11:54,205
Speaker 4:  This is help. They've already done it once. They they did it, they did

1217
01:11:54,205 --> 01:11:58,125
Speaker 4:  a couple of days ago with the Fox Sports All Star game and we all

1218
01:11:58,125 --> 01:12:01,645
Speaker 4:  immediately went to social media to talk about watching

1219
01:12:01,645 --> 01:12:02,125
Speaker 4:  4K.

1220
01:12:02,275 --> 01:12:05,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that was huge news. Everybody, everybody knew that on

1221
01:12:05,165 --> 01:12:08,565
Speaker 4:  Sling TV and on their Roku or Amazon Fire advice,

1222
01:12:09,545 --> 01:12:13,045
Speaker 4:  but they didn't. Partially because it's, it's pretty much limited to sling

1223
01:12:13,115 --> 01:12:16,965
Speaker 4:  blue subscribers. 'cause there's two versions of Sling only in a couple

1224
01:12:16,965 --> 01:12:18,205
Speaker 4:  of major, a few major cities.

1225
01:12:18,205 --> 01:12:20,925
Speaker 3:  Okay. They're fully at an 80. They're fully at an 80. This is so common.

1226
01:12:21,205 --> 01:12:24,125
Speaker 3:  I care about this so much and it's so hard to understand what you're saying,

1227
01:12:24,225 --> 01:12:24,645
Speaker 3:  but if

1228
01:12:24,645 --> 01:12:28,605
Speaker 4:  You're in Gainesville, Florida, yeah. You You can get it

1229
01:12:29,305 --> 01:12:32,405
Speaker 4:  and you don't have to pay extra. Okay, sure. So it's yeah.

1230
01:12:32,505 --> 01:12:36,405
Speaker 5:  Big up to Gainesville. Yeah. I'll say if you run a streaming service and

1231
01:12:36,405 --> 01:12:40,205
Speaker 5:  you're out there 4K streaming as a, as a

1232
01:12:40,205 --> 01:12:44,165
Speaker 5:  like free up service to keep people engaged is going

1233
01:12:44,165 --> 01:12:48,085
Speaker 5:  to work. Someone needs to go out and just be the one that's like, yes,

1234
01:12:48,085 --> 01:12:52,005
Speaker 5:  You can have 4K for no more money because we love you. Besides Sling it will

1235
01:12:52,005 --> 01:12:55,765
Speaker 5:  work. Sling did it for what sounds like 11 people. So

1236
01:12:56,055 --> 01:13:00,045
Speaker 5:  great. I'm thrilled for those 11 people. Gainesville I'm

1237
01:13:00,045 --> 01:13:03,205
Speaker 5:  sure is, is, you know, happy rioting in the streets, like that's great, but

1238
01:13:04,155 --> 01:13:07,565
Speaker 5:  this, this is a feature that could work. Like this is the kind of thing

1239
01:13:07,875 --> 01:13:11,525
Speaker 5:  that people want and someone who wants their customers to be happy

1240
01:13:11,745 --> 01:13:13,005
Speaker 5:  should give this to them.

1241
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:17,045
Speaker 3:  Again, I have said many times YouTube should just pay to produce all the

1242
01:13:17,045 --> 01:13:19,685
Speaker 3:  games in 4K and then just have 4K games on YouTube tv.

1243
01:13:20,035 --> 01:13:20,845
Speaker 5:  Yeah. and

1244
01:13:20,845 --> 01:13:23,885
Speaker 3:  It, it's too con like they have the money and I, I'm pretty sure they would.

1245
01:13:23,885 --> 01:13:27,685
Speaker 3:  It's Google. They're like, whatever. I think it's too complicated.

1246
01:13:29,715 --> 01:13:33,085
Speaker 3:  Yeah. All right, David, bring us home. Oh my God. Okay. $27 million mansion.

1247
01:13:33,085 --> 01:13:33,885
Speaker 3:  That sucks. This is the, this

1248
01:13:33,885 --> 01:13:37,565
Speaker 5:  Is the best news. So Sam Altman bought a house

1249
01:13:37,745 --> 01:13:41,245
Speaker 5:  in 2020 for $27 million. That was,

1250
01:13:42,205 --> 01:13:45,085
Speaker 5:  I don't know if it was when he bought it, but it was at least at one time

1251
01:13:45,185 --> 01:13:48,925
Speaker 5:  the most expensive San Francisco real estate listing ever. and it

1252
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:49,285
Speaker 5:  sucked.

1253
01:13:50,345 --> 01:13:50,565
Speaker 3:  And

1254
01:13:50,985 --> 01:13:54,725
Speaker 5:  He sued or he his his people through a

1255
01:13:54,725 --> 01:13:58,605
Speaker 5:  series of weird corporate things that is fighting another

1256
01:13:58,605 --> 01:14:02,205
Speaker 5:  series of weird corporate things on the side of the developers sued

1257
01:14:02,995 --> 01:14:06,805
Speaker 5:  because basically they built him, what,

1258
01:14:06,835 --> 01:14:10,525
Speaker 5:  what his lawyers are alleging was a lemon of a $27 million house.

1259
01:14:10,835 --> 01:14:14,725
Speaker 5:  This whole story is bananas. So the Architectural Digest made

1260
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:18,805
Speaker 5:  an 11 minute long video. I'll link it in the show notes going through

1261
01:14:18,805 --> 01:14:22,525
Speaker 5:  the house before it was sold. And the house is, it's not

1262
01:14:22,675 --> 01:14:26,525
Speaker 5:  beautiful, but it's like incredible if that makes sense. It has,

1263
01:14:26,865 --> 01:14:30,565
Speaker 5:  it has a gym, it has a massage room, it has a closet that is larger

1264
01:14:30,635 --> 01:14:33,285
Speaker 5:  than most houses. It has a

1265
01:14:33,445 --> 01:14:34,405
Speaker 4:  Wellness cottage, right?

1266
01:14:34,825 --> 01:14:37,645
Speaker 5:  It has a wellness cottage. Thank you. That's the phrase I was looking for.

1267
01:14:38,425 --> 01:14:41,805
Speaker 5:  It has three ovens in the kitchen, which seems like one more than even like

1268
01:14:41,805 --> 01:14:45,325
Speaker 5:  the very extravagant amount of ovens to have it,

1269
01:14:45,825 --> 01:14:49,445
Speaker 5:  but it's real like show showstopping piece was this

1270
01:14:49,525 --> 01:14:53,165
Speaker 5:  cantilevered infinity pool that kind of looked out over San Francisco. It's

1271
01:14:53,365 --> 01:14:53,405
Speaker 5:  gorgeous.

1272
01:14:55,315 --> 01:14:59,285
Speaker 5:  According to the lawsuit, the people who were building

1273
01:14:59,465 --> 01:15:03,325
Speaker 5:  the house were involved in a bunch of like

1274
01:15:03,325 --> 01:15:06,605
Speaker 5:  corporate and financial shenanigans that led to

1275
01:15:07,115 --> 01:15:10,965
Speaker 5:  them doing a crappy job and not paying contractors.

1276
01:15:11,345 --> 01:15:14,925
Speaker 5:  Who then as a sabotage move did things like

1277
01:15:15,565 --> 01:15:19,165
Speaker 5:  shove bags and debris into drains, which then

1278
01:15:19,165 --> 01:15:23,005
Speaker 5:  clogged those drains, which did things like cause a ceiling to collapse

1279
01:15:23,465 --> 01:15:26,725
Speaker 5:  in the gym in the house it caused,

1280
01:15:27,135 --> 01:15:30,645
Speaker 5:  there were, there were like inches of standing water under some of the walkways.

1281
01:15:30,645 --> 01:15:34,365
Speaker 5:  There was apparently mold everywhere. Let's see, what else do I have?

1282
01:15:34,725 --> 01:15:37,365
Speaker 5:  Numerous leaking irrigation lines that were incorrectly installed on the

1283
01:15:37,365 --> 01:15:40,965
Speaker 5:  rooftop garden. Failure of the tread lights and the exterior

1284
01:15:40,965 --> 01:15:44,445
Speaker 5:  staircase, which were repaired but then failed again, defects in the design

1285
01:15:44,445 --> 01:15:48,085
Speaker 5:  and waterproofing of exterior planters just over and over and over again.

1286
01:15:48,785 --> 01:15:52,685
Speaker 5:  Big giant pool basically leaking into and rapidly destroying the rest of

1287
01:15:52,685 --> 01:15:56,485
Speaker 5:  the house. And the, the estimates were that the price

1288
01:15:56,505 --> 01:15:59,925
Speaker 5:  to fix all of this is going to be more than $4 million, which is

1289
01:16:00,525 --> 01:16:04,165
Speaker 5:  a number for repairs that I cannot fathom. And so

1290
01:16:04,165 --> 01:16:07,805
Speaker 5:  basically the, the lawsuit now is saying that Sam Altman was

1291
01:16:07,805 --> 01:16:11,045
Speaker 5:  essentially duped into buying a $27 million piece of crap.

1292
01:16:12,065 --> 01:16:15,485
Speaker 4:  Who made it? Was it It is so funny. It was like DR Horton behind it because

1293
01:16:15,485 --> 01:16:15,685
Speaker 4:  it,

1294
01:16:18,265 --> 01:16:19,525
Speaker 4:  one of the other big builders.

1295
01:16:20,515 --> 01:16:24,125
Speaker 3:  Well, I'm just saying sometimes you get duped into spending a lot of money

1296
01:16:24,745 --> 01:16:28,285
Speaker 3:  on an engineering marvel that can't actually do all the things people say

1297
01:16:28,285 --> 01:16:28,685
Speaker 6:  It could do.

1298
01:16:32,835 --> 01:16:33,365
Speaker 6:  Just, yeah,

1299
01:16:33,515 --> 01:16:36,725
Speaker 3:  Just one of those things. What if the capabilities of this cantilevered pool

1300
01:16:37,345 --> 01:16:41,165
Speaker 3:  do not match with the staggering amount of hype that

1301
01:16:41,165 --> 01:16:42,285
Speaker 3:  has come with said pool?

1302
01:16:43,445 --> 01:16:46,125
Speaker 5:  Hmm. Do you think the pool helps you send like slightly better business emails?

1303
01:16:46,465 --> 01:16:48,965
Speaker 3:  The pool has already tried to have sex with Kevin Ru,

1304
01:16:58,345 --> 01:16:59,165
Speaker 5:  But yeah, I should say

1305
01:16:59,165 --> 01:17:01,285
Speaker 3:  On the one hand, I love you Kevin. On the one

1306
01:17:01,285 --> 01:17:04,285
Speaker 5:  Hand, like this sucks. I don't mean to like particularly make fun of Sam

1307
01:17:04,285 --> 01:17:07,485
Speaker 5:  Walt, but like, as somebody who just went through a much less expensive and

1308
01:17:07,485 --> 01:17:11,245
Speaker 5:  problematic house renovation, this sucks. And like the

1309
01:17:11,245 --> 01:17:15,005
Speaker 5:  idea of spending all of this money on a house and then basically

1310
01:17:15,245 --> 01:17:18,885
Speaker 5:  discovering it is literally collapsing inside of itself.

1311
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:23,485
Speaker 5:  That sucks. I don't wish that on anybody in another way. It's very funny.

1312
01:17:23,675 --> 01:17:26,805
Speaker 3:  It's the, the metaphor here is very good. Yeah. Also, he was just driving

1313
01:17:26,805 --> 01:17:29,005
Speaker 3:  around like a $5 million clinic segment, right? Yeah,

1314
01:17:29,005 --> 01:17:29,445
Speaker 5:  It's fine.

1315
01:17:29,825 --> 01:17:33,085
Speaker 4:  And the house is so ugly. Like it's just

1316
01:17:34,515 --> 01:17:37,445
Speaker 4:  like incredibly, incredibly unattractive house.

1317
01:17:38,305 --> 01:17:42,285
Speaker 4:  So good for him. He can go get it redone. Like take his his earnings from,

1318
01:17:42,285 --> 01:17:45,805
Speaker 4:  from the lawsuit, make it look like a real house. It'll be great.

1319
01:17:46,635 --> 01:17:49,845
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's just, I, it, I would encourage everyone to go read the lawsuit.

1320
01:17:49,955 --> 01:17:53,365
Speaker 5:  I'll link it. It's, it's 38 pages and the first like 10 pages

1321
01:17:53,865 --> 01:17:57,765
Speaker 5:  are just explaining the structure of the company that

1322
01:17:57,765 --> 01:18:01,605
Speaker 5:  built this house and how insane it was. And there was like, they lost

1323
01:18:01,725 --> 01:18:02,965
Speaker 5:  a $50 million

1324
01:18:04,725 --> 01:18:07,445
Speaker 5:  judgment against them for other shoddy work that they did. And they were

1325
01:18:07,445 --> 01:18:09,765
Speaker 5:  like, the company was like running outta money. So they stopped funding their

1326
01:18:09,765 --> 01:18:13,645
Speaker 5:  projects while also at the same time doing marketing about

1327
01:18:13,645 --> 01:18:17,405
Speaker 5:  how like their whole thing was detailed and 25% of their work went into things

1328
01:18:17,405 --> 01:18:20,005
Speaker 5:  that the owner would never see because they just care that much. And that's

1329
01:18:20,005 --> 01:18:23,965
Speaker 5:  how it's 27 million I. love it. It's so, so funny. The

1330
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:27,765
Speaker 5:  whole thing is just like, there, there will be a documentary about this and

1331
01:18:27,765 --> 01:18:29,325
Speaker 5:  I will watch every single second of it.

1332
01:18:29,745 --> 01:18:32,965
Speaker 3:  And the documentary will be made by SOA and most of it'll be lies.

1333
01:18:35,315 --> 01:18:38,365
Speaker 3:  It's gonna be great. Yeah. I'm excited. Alright. We are way over. Like I

1334
01:18:38,365 --> 01:18:41,245
Speaker 3:  said, it's already next week. It's next week at the end of the first segment.

1335
01:18:43,435 --> 01:18:46,205
Speaker 5:  It's, it's fine Now it's September. Yeah. The iPhones are here now. Let's

1336
01:18:46,205 --> 01:18:46,765
Speaker 5:  talk about that. Yeah.

1337
01:18:46,825 --> 01:18:50,125
Speaker 3:  Oh no. All right. You gotta go. But before we do, I just wanna call it one

1338
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:53,125
Speaker 3:  story and it said this incredible, if you're an old head gadget blogger like

1339
01:18:53,125 --> 01:18:56,925
Speaker 3:  me, Sean Hollister and John Porter wrote about the

1340
01:18:56,985 --> 01:19:00,485
Speaker 3:  stream deck, the Elga stream deck and where it came from, which is this

1341
01:19:00,675 --> 01:19:04,165
Speaker 3:  legendary gadget blogger obsession, the Art

1342
01:19:04,375 --> 01:19:07,485
Speaker 3:  Leive optimist keyboard. It turns out, by the way, art Leiv

1343
01:19:08,145 --> 01:19:11,565
Speaker 3:  turned into like a very weird, hard right Russian

1344
01:19:11,925 --> 01:19:14,565
Speaker 3:  nationalist, which we had to add to the story. Oh boy. Which was not what

1345
01:19:14,565 --> 01:19:18,405
Speaker 3:  I wanted out of this very innocent story about the stream deck, but that

1346
01:19:18,405 --> 01:19:22,285
Speaker 3:  is such as 2024. But if you were like me, you're like reading

1347
01:19:22,285 --> 01:19:26,165
Speaker 3:  and writing gadget blogs it like 20 years ago, this keyboard

1348
01:19:26,355 --> 01:19:30,245
Speaker 3:  just kept coming up as the thing everybody wanted. and it turns out the company

1349
01:19:30,245 --> 01:19:33,285
Speaker 3:  that made the actual display has kept going and that turned into the stream

1350
01:19:33,285 --> 01:19:37,245
Speaker 3:  deck. And it's just like a winding tale of some people really

1351
01:19:37,245 --> 01:19:40,125
Speaker 3:  believe in that key should light up and I love it. And the design is incredible.

1352
01:19:40,125 --> 01:19:43,685
Speaker 3:  Cool. So go read that and then we've, we have just tons and tons of stories
