Description: Handheld gaming looks like the future — so why isn't it more popular? The Verge's Sean Hollister joins the show to talk about some new data about the handheld console market, what it says about the Steam Deck's dominance, whether the Switch 2 might change everything all over again, and why Sony and Microsoft don't appear to be in the game at all. After that, David reports on his trip to Florida to see TGL, the golf league aiming to bring the sport to new places and new fans, with the help of a truly enormous amount of technology. Finally, we answer a question on the Vergecast Hotline about iPads — and more specifically, one particularly good reason to upgrade to the Air or the Pro.

00:00:03,265 --> 00:00:06,875
Speaker 1:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of the Handheld Gaming

3
00:00:06,985 --> 00:00:10,315
Speaker 1:  Wars. I'm your friend David Pierce and I am sitting here messing around with

4
00:00:10,315 --> 00:00:13,475
Speaker 1:  a new phone. It's the nothing Phone three A Pro.

5
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:17,395
Speaker 1:  I think this phone's actually sort of interesting. Nothing in general has

6
00:00:17,395 --> 00:00:21,115
Speaker 1:  like big cool ideas about smartphones, but I've talked a bunch

7
00:00:21,115 --> 00:00:24,875
Speaker 1:  already on this show about how I suspect this is going to be a

8
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:28,675
Speaker 1:  relatively uninteresting year in smartphones. Flip phones

9
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:32,035
Speaker 1:  and foldable phones aren't quite ready to go fully mainstream.

10
00:00:32,495 --> 00:00:35,875
Speaker 1:  And I think the, the iPhones and galaxies and pixels of the world

11
00:00:36,345 --> 00:00:39,715
Speaker 1:  just aren't gonna be that interesting. So one of the challenges for myself

12
00:00:39,715 --> 00:00:43,595
Speaker 1:  this year has been to find new, interesting ideas about smartphones.

13
00:00:43,615 --> 00:00:47,075
Speaker 1:  And I think the thing in this phone, it's called the

14
00:00:47,075 --> 00:00:50,835
Speaker 1:  Essential Key, and it's basically a button on the side that is

15
00:00:51,075 --> 00:00:54,475
Speaker 1:  designed to be an AI input. It's not like visual

16
00:00:54,475 --> 00:00:57,995
Speaker 1:  intelligence in the way that, you know, apple is trying to do stuff for all

17
00:00:57,995 --> 00:01:01,515
Speaker 1:  the complicated multimodal systems. This is just, right now, frankly, it's

18
00:01:01,515 --> 00:01:05,235
Speaker 1:  a glorified voice recorder. But the idea is that it can also do things like

19
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:09,075
Speaker 1:  take screenshots and just ingest information from

20
00:01:09,095 --> 00:01:12,595
Speaker 1:  you as you use your phone and then store it, organize it, make sense of it.

21
00:01:12,935 --> 00:01:16,915
Speaker 1:  That's actually a thing AI is set up to do relatively well and strikes

22
00:01:16,915 --> 00:01:20,635
Speaker 1:  me as a pretty good idea. It's super, super limited on this phone. It like

23
00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:23,395
Speaker 1:  barely can do any of the things that I thought it might be able to do. But

24
00:01:23,665 --> 00:01:27,475
Speaker 1:  cool idea and seems like the sort of thing that if AI is gonna come into

25
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:30,955
Speaker 1:  smartphones, this is what it should look like. Anyway, we are not here to

26
00:01:30,955 --> 00:01:34,835
Speaker 1:  talk about really AI or smartphones today. We are gonna do two

27
00:01:34,835 --> 00:01:38,475
Speaker 1:  things on the show. First, I'm gonna talk to Sean Hollister about some

28
00:01:38,585 --> 00:01:42,515
Speaker 1:  data that he got about how the Steam Deck is doing compared to all

29
00:01:42,515 --> 00:01:46,355
Speaker 1:  of the other gaming handhelds out there and what it says about

30
00:01:46,355 --> 00:01:49,955
Speaker 1:  where the Steam Deck and the switch to and all the other handheld consoles

31
00:01:50,325 --> 00:01:53,675
Speaker 1:  might go next. After that, I'm gonna tell you a story about

32
00:01:54,235 --> 00:01:57,555
Speaker 1:  a golf tournament that I went to. I went to West Palm Beach, Florida to see

33
00:01:57,715 --> 00:02:01,635
Speaker 1:  a thing that is, if not the future of golf, A

34
00:02:01,635 --> 00:02:05,155
Speaker 1:  future of golf, or at least it desperately wants to be. And I think what

35
00:02:05,155 --> 00:02:09,115
Speaker 1:  that looks like and what that means and how you even do that is

36
00:02:09,115 --> 00:02:11,715
Speaker 1:  really interesting. So I'm gonna tell you a little bit about it. Then we

37
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,755
Speaker 1:  have a question from The Vergecast hotline. Lots of fun stuff coming in this

38
00:02:14,755 --> 00:02:18,515
Speaker 1:  episode. I'm very excited about it and I hope you enjoy it. All that is coming

39
00:02:18,515 --> 00:02:22,475
Speaker 1:  up in just a second. But first this thing lights up all the time and

40
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:26,275
Speaker 1:  it beeps at me and nothing has a lot of weird interface ideas that

41
00:02:26,435 --> 00:02:30,355
Speaker 1:  I need to go turn off. So I'm gonna go do that. This is the verse

42
00:02:30,355 --> 00:02:31,475
Speaker 1:  cast. We'll be right back.

43
00:03:04,155 --> 00:03:07,125
Speaker 1:  Welcome back. All right, let's talk about video games.

44
00:03:08,425 --> 00:03:12,405
Speaker 1:  I'm not the world's most qualified person to talk about the

45
00:03:12,645 --> 00:03:15,925
Speaker 1:  bleeding edge of video games. I should just be honest about that. I have

46
00:03:16,085 --> 00:03:19,565
Speaker 1:  a PS four right here and I have an original Nintendo Switch.

47
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:23,765
Speaker 1:  That's where I do most of my gaming. I've been waiting to upgrade

48
00:03:23,945 --> 00:03:27,825
Speaker 1:  to a PS five. I don't know what four for something.

49
00:03:27,855 --> 00:03:30,905
Speaker 1:  It's just that all of the games I wanted for so long were on the PS four

50
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:34,945
Speaker 1:  and then I mostly became a Switch person and I play some PC games too,

51
00:03:35,285 --> 00:03:38,825
Speaker 1:  but like I am not the person, the

52
00:03:39,145 --> 00:03:43,025
Speaker 1:  absolute cutting edge of PC graphics for everything, which I think might

53
00:03:43,045 --> 00:03:46,865
Speaker 1:  be the reason I'm so interested in handheld gaming, which seem like

54
00:03:46,865 --> 00:03:50,585
Speaker 1:  they have the possibility to give me what I want, which is something easy

55
00:03:50,685 --> 00:03:54,305
Speaker 1:  and portable and uncomplicated, but also give me

56
00:03:54,505 --> 00:03:57,985
Speaker 1:  access to this new generation of games. We've talked about handheld gaming

57
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:01,785
Speaker 1:  a lot on this show from the switch to the Steam Deck to

58
00:04:01,885 --> 00:04:05,865
Speaker 1:  all this stuff from I Neo and other companies that are flooding the internet.

59
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:09,945
Speaker 1:  But it turns out that the market is a little bit different than I expected

60
00:04:10,085 --> 00:04:13,865
Speaker 1:  in some ways that I was a little bit surprised by Sean Hollister

61
00:04:13,885 --> 00:04:17,745
Speaker 1:  on our team, got some data, he's been testing all of these things and he

62
00:04:17,745 --> 00:04:21,465
Speaker 1:  understands where we are in this space and where it's headed. So I figured

63
00:04:21,655 --> 00:04:25,465
Speaker 1:  this is a good time to get into it. Let's check it out. Sean Hollister,

64
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,305
Speaker 1:  welcome to the show.

65
00:04:26,805 --> 00:04:27,025
Speaker 5:  I'm

66
00:04:27,025 --> 00:04:29,745
Speaker 1:  Back. I get to do this a couple times with you recently. This is very exciting

67
00:04:29,745 --> 00:04:30,025
Speaker 1:  for me.

68
00:04:30,455 --> 00:04:31,545
Speaker 5:  It's so good to be here.

69
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:36,105
Speaker 1:  We were talking just before we started recording about why we are both so

70
00:04:36,105 --> 00:04:39,785
Speaker 1:  interested in gaming handhelds and I think the reason for you is because

71
00:04:39,885 --> 00:04:43,385
Speaker 1:  you, you use a lot of them and care about them and are interested in them

72
00:04:43,385 --> 00:04:47,145
Speaker 1:  and have them. I have no rational reason for my interest

73
00:04:47,165 --> 00:04:50,665
Speaker 1:  in this category. I think, I think gaming handhelds are like the most interesting

74
00:04:50,865 --> 00:04:54,705
Speaker 1:  hardware category on earth. And yet the only thing I play video games on

75
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:58,785
Speaker 1:  is my like first gen Nintendo switch

76
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:02,785
Speaker 1:  that sucks. Just like this is the thing I care about. You

77
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:05,865
Speaker 5:  Say it sucks, but a moment ago before we started recording, you told me that

78
00:05:05,865 --> 00:05:07,145
Speaker 5:  you were happy with it. I

79
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:10,505
Speaker 1:  Am happy with it. So the thing that I learned is we, we talked about this

80
00:05:10,735 --> 00:05:14,265
Speaker 1:  last fall and you guys, I would say did a

81
00:05:14,325 --> 00:05:17,825
Speaker 1:  heroic job of trying to sell me on a Steam Deck, which I did not buy.

82
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:22,105
Speaker 1:  Oh, potentially should have. Oh, and, and we should come back to that. But

83
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:25,665
Speaker 1:  I did not buy it. And what I did instead was just resolve to never unplug

84
00:05:25,665 --> 00:05:29,545
Speaker 1:  my switch ever again. And now It is, It is a, It is

85
00:05:29,585 --> 00:05:33,025
Speaker 1:  a console that sits here on my desk plugged in and it works just fine.

86
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:33,705
Speaker 1:  That's it.

87
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:37,705
Speaker 5:  I thought the Nintendo Switch was a revelation. What it came about. It, it,

88
00:05:37,965 --> 00:05:41,265
Speaker 5:  it really felt like that as soon as they got over the hump of it just being

89
00:05:41,265 --> 00:05:44,785
Speaker 5:  only a Zelda machine, it was like, this is amazing. You have games

90
00:05:45,015 --> 00:05:48,425
Speaker 5:  that are the same games when you're docked and the same games on the go.

91
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:52,385
Speaker 5:  They're the full games. You can play through full games now wherever

92
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:55,985
Speaker 5:  you are at any given moment on the toilet of course. And everywhere else

93
00:05:56,045 --> 00:05:59,725
Speaker 5:  you might go in your daily life, not just there in front of your big

94
00:05:59,725 --> 00:06:03,525
Speaker 5:  4K tv. And so that is, that was a revelation for me.

95
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:07,405
Speaker 5:  And then the Steam Deck when it came along was, and now

96
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:11,165
Speaker 5:  those games can be this giant library of games that you've owned on

97
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:14,805
Speaker 5:  PC for a decade, right? And it can be the new PC games that are coming out

98
00:06:14,805 --> 00:06:18,645
Speaker 5:  and it's not just restricted to, again, Zelda and Mario. And I'm like,

99
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:22,485
Speaker 5:  okay, revelation on top of Revelation, I am so sold. You just

100
00:06:22,485 --> 00:06:26,325
Speaker 5:  need to figure out all these bugs valve. And they did over the course

101
00:06:26,325 --> 00:06:30,245
Speaker 5:  of like three to nine months and then they started selling more of

102
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:33,925
Speaker 5:  them. And apparently though the market isn't as big as anybody

103
00:06:34,135 --> 00:06:37,965
Speaker 5:  hoped or expected, who talks about this as lovingly as you and I do. So yeah.

104
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:38,725
Speaker 5:  So let's, let's actually

105
00:06:38,725 --> 00:06:41,165
Speaker 1:  Start there. I think there, there are a few pieces of what you just said

106
00:06:41,165 --> 00:06:45,045
Speaker 1:  that I wanna, I wanna poke at. But you wrote a story recently where

107
00:06:45,045 --> 00:06:48,245
Speaker 1:  you, you got some new data about

108
00:06:48,905 --> 00:06:52,485
Speaker 1:  how well the Steam Deck is doing, but also how well the Steam Deck is doing

109
00:06:52,685 --> 00:06:56,085
Speaker 1:  compared to its competition. Can you just walk me through a little bit of

110
00:06:56,155 --> 00:06:56,805
Speaker 1:  what you learned?

111
00:06:57,315 --> 00:07:00,725
Speaker 5:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I'll walk through it my way first and then I wanna

112
00:07:00,725 --> 00:07:03,605
Speaker 5:  walk through it like the way everybody else has reacted to it. Okay. 'cause

113
00:07:03,605 --> 00:07:07,325
Speaker 5:  the two very different ways, I wrote a story and I, I'm just gonna read you

114
00:07:07,325 --> 00:07:11,205
Speaker 5:  the headline really quick. Three years later, the Steam Deck has

115
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:14,965
Speaker 5:  dominated handheld PC gaming was, was my headline,

116
00:07:14,965 --> 00:07:18,685
Speaker 5:  which I put out on, on on the third birthday of the system launching. So

117
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:21,965
Speaker 5:  I was like, okay, let's do this as a curtain razor, why not? I didn't actually

118
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:25,005
Speaker 5:  grab this data thinking it was going to be for the third birthday. It just

119
00:07:25,165 --> 00:07:27,445
Speaker 5:  happened to be a nice coincidence that when I started writing it, I was like,

120
00:07:27,985 --> 00:07:31,365
Speaker 5:  you know, if I hold onto this two more days, love when that happens, can

121
00:07:31,365 --> 00:07:35,205
Speaker 5:  publish shit on the birthday, why not? But so, so so I I, I went

122
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:39,005
Speaker 5:  out and a, I asked, I actually got tipped off during cs. Somebody was

123
00:07:39,005 --> 00:07:41,885
Speaker 5:  like, I asked them, you know, well how big is the total addressable market

124
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:45,045
Speaker 5:  for, for gaming handhelds anyway? And they're like, well according to the

125
00:07:45,045 --> 00:07:48,925
Speaker 5:  latest IDC numbers, it's prob IDC numbers. Well let me

126
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:52,725
Speaker 5:  talk to the guy at the IDC who compiles numbers. Yes. And, and I was,

127
00:07:52,845 --> 00:07:56,525
Speaker 5:  I was so happy that guy at the IDC who compiles numbers, whose name is Louis Ward

128
00:07:56,545 --> 00:08:00,405
Speaker 5:  by the way, was willing to share some of this with me. What

129
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:03,885
Speaker 5:  I thought this was going to be about was, we know the Steam Deck has sold

130
00:08:04,565 --> 00:08:08,485
Speaker 5:  millions, multiple millions, but how big

131
00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:12,005
Speaker 5:  a deal is it compared to the Windows handouts? 'cause there've been Jesus

132
00:08:12,255 --> 00:08:15,485
Speaker 5:  rogue Ally, ROG Ally, for those of you who are

133
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:17,005
Speaker 5:  nitpicky about that, it's

134
00:08:17,045 --> 00:08:20,765
Speaker 1:  RI don't wanna hear all it's, it's rock. Listen, I understand an acronym.

135
00:08:21,075 --> 00:08:21,565
Speaker 1:  It's Rock.

136
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:25,965
Speaker 5:  I say rock I get made fun of every time it's great Lenovo

137
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:29,845
Speaker 5:  Legion go the MSI Claw and so on. And

138
00:08:29,945 --> 00:08:33,685
Speaker 5:  at least two of those have had a big presence at retail. You know, best

139
00:08:33,785 --> 00:08:37,725
Speaker 5:  Buy, you go there, you can buy two different kinds of Asus r Ally

140
00:08:38,065 --> 00:08:41,565
Speaker 5:  and you can buy your Lenovo Legion Go. I was like, well the things that everybody

141
00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:45,125
Speaker 5:  can just go buy, they probably have a big chunk of the market right now.

142
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:49,005
Speaker 5:  Right? And so what Lewis told me, what he showed me was that

143
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:53,685
Speaker 5:  not so much the Steam Deck is like at probably around

144
00:08:53,685 --> 00:08:56,925
Speaker 5:  4 million and the Windows handhelds are probably at around

145
00:08:57,265 --> 00:09:01,205
Speaker 5:  2 million total. So total, this is cumulative. Not

146
00:09:01,205 --> 00:09:04,925
Speaker 5:  not per year. This is like since, but, but you're getting into the way everybody

147
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:08,005
Speaker 5:  else is reading this. So since, since 2022 when the Steam Deck came out,

148
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:11,765
Speaker 5:  and of course the Steam Deck had the entire first year, 2022 to itself.

149
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:14,925
Speaker 5:  So yeah, big head start building a new category.

150
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:19,005
Speaker 5:  What a lot of other people took away from my story is

151
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:23,895
Speaker 5:  handheld PC gaming is going nowhere fast. It's tiny.

152
00:09:24,475 --> 00:09:27,935
Speaker 5:  It is tiny compared to PCs it's tiny compared to, you know, probably desktop

153
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:31,935
Speaker 5:  graphics cards probably tiny compared to gaming laptops. It's very

154
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:35,855
Speaker 5:  tiny compared to Switch of course, which sells more in

155
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:40,175
Speaker 5:  a quarter than all of these have sold in three years. Even now that everybody

156
00:09:40,175 --> 00:09:41,535
Speaker 5:  knows the Switch two is coming, yes,

157
00:09:41,535 --> 00:09:45,455
Speaker 1:  There are somewhere in the range of like six-ish million handheld

158
00:09:45,455 --> 00:09:47,935
Speaker 1:  game consoles out there that are not the switch.

159
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:51,935
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It with the, with the exception of China. China

160
00:09:52,035 --> 00:09:55,055
Speaker 5:  is like the currently, and they're working on this, it's currently a hole

161
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,455
Speaker 5:  in the IDCs estimates. By the way, these are estimated shipments

162
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:03,655
Speaker 5:  not right. Actual consoles and not sold. So

163
00:10:03,855 --> 00:10:07,455
Speaker 5:  shipments. So theoretically shipments does include things like

164
00:10:09,805 --> 00:10:12,895
Speaker 5:  handhelds that are currently at retail and haven't been sold through yet,

165
00:10:12,895 --> 00:10:16,855
Speaker 5:  or handhelds that are being stockpiled. It also may include, because IDC

166
00:10:16,855 --> 00:10:20,095
Speaker 5:  is basing these estimates off of supply chain things like big batch orders

167
00:10:20,195 --> 00:10:23,175
Speaker 5:  of components going from somewhere here in, you know, in Taiwan or somewhere

168
00:10:23,175 --> 00:10:26,615
Speaker 5:  in China to the United States or to Europe. It is worldwide.

169
00:10:27,195 --> 00:10:31,015
Speaker 5:  But the, it may also include, you know, they bought a whole bunch of

170
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:34,695
Speaker 5:  components for a handheld that hasn't been chipped or even maybe announced

171
00:10:34,715 --> 00:10:38,375
Speaker 5:  yet. We don't know for sure that these are like actual handhelds,

172
00:10:38,515 --> 00:10:41,535
Speaker 5:  but given what some of the other estimates out there, given what we Valve

173
00:10:41,595 --> 00:10:45,455
Speaker 5:  has said about the multiple millions, these numbers seem right. The

174
00:10:45,475 --> 00:10:49,175
Speaker 5:  one hole is China, IDC has not necessarily gone

175
00:10:49,435 --> 00:10:52,975
Speaker 5:  one to look at what is being sold in China because again, it's tracking

176
00:10:53,155 --> 00:10:56,935
Speaker 5:  supply chain components that are being shipped out right. Of China.

177
00:10:57,355 --> 00:11:00,935
Speaker 5:  So maybe there's a decent sized handheld gaming market in China.

178
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:05,135
Speaker 5:  IDC is also not tracking the few, and I've always called them boutique

179
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:09,015
Speaker 5:  sellers of handheld gaming PCs like GPD in

180
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:13,135
Speaker 5:  Neo one X Player. There's other like ones like

181
00:11:13,135 --> 00:11:17,055
Speaker 5:  this that might also sell a bunch of Windows handheld gaming

182
00:11:17,315 --> 00:11:20,335
Speaker 5:  PCs. But when we look at like their Kickstarters, we're talking about

183
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:25,015
Speaker 5:  thousands of units, not millions of units. So we don't

184
00:11:25,015 --> 00:11:27,455
Speaker 5:  think they're making a big dent yet. We just don't know.

185
00:11:27,795 --> 00:11:31,655
Speaker 1:  So even in the very best case scenario, we're dealing with a

186
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:33,055
Speaker 1:  very small thing here.

187
00:11:33,885 --> 00:11:37,815
Speaker 5:  Yeah, yeah. It's small and, and, and is small. Like,

188
00:11:38,775 --> 00:11:42,195
Speaker 5:  is that good at three years? That's, that's like the question and

189
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:46,245
Speaker 5:  AMD's, Frank Ezor will be like, we're inventing a new category. Sure.

190
00:11:46,615 --> 00:11:50,485
Speaker 5:  Three years, you know, this is great. You look over at Smart Glasses,

191
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:54,245
Speaker 5:  you look over at Metas Ray bands, metas Ray bands are like at

192
00:11:54,435 --> 00:11:57,645
Speaker 5:  what, 2 million? And so, you know,

193
00:11:58,395 --> 00:12:02,085
Speaker 5:  they're, they're talking about ramping up quickly to 10 million per year

194
00:12:02,145 --> 00:12:06,045
Speaker 5:  at some point. Just Essilor Luxottica, the glasses

195
00:12:06,365 --> 00:12:10,045
Speaker 5:  maker working with meta and smart glasses. Just one firm, pretty big firm.

196
00:12:10,515 --> 00:12:13,885
Speaker 5:  Just one firm from 2 million cumulative to like

197
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:17,885
Speaker 5:  10 million annually. Maybe there's room

198
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:21,765
Speaker 5:  for Wind for Windows or for, sorry for, for Handels that play

199
00:12:21,765 --> 00:12:24,765
Speaker 5:  Windows games, let's put it that way. Sure. To go that direction,

200
00:12:26,565 --> 00:12:30,225
Speaker 5:  but I don't know, it's, it's not growing fast. And it

201
00:12:30,605 --> 00:12:33,945
Speaker 5:  did grow a bit and then it shrunk in 2023

202
00:12:34,485 --> 00:12:38,425
Speaker 5:  the year that that not that, that it was

203
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:41,985
Speaker 5:  no longer just valve with the Steam Deck, it was also the R-O-G-L-I, it was

204
00:12:41,985 --> 00:12:43,425
Speaker 5:  also of Allegion. Go

205
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:48,665
Speaker 5:  say shipments, estimated shipments nearly doubled.

206
00:12:50,005 --> 00:12:53,865
Speaker 5:  But then they have again in going into 2024. So

207
00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:56,945
Speaker 5:  interesting. Maybe a bit of trough of disillusionment. Maybe a lot of people

208
00:12:57,085 --> 00:13:00,945
Speaker 5:  bought those ROG allies and Le Legion

209
00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:04,545
Speaker 5:  Ghost or even Steam Deck and decided to return them or decided that

210
00:13:04,975 --> 00:13:08,905
Speaker 5:  they had as many as they wanted in the market and they, nobody needed to

211
00:13:08,905 --> 00:13:11,705
Speaker 5:  buy another one. Right now. Maybe it's a wait and see thing. Maybe some of

212
00:13:11,705 --> 00:13:15,585
Speaker 5:  those people are like, well why would I buy a Steam Deck when I'm

213
00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:19,345
Speaker 5:  sure a Steam Deck too is coming and better things on the way.

214
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,545
Speaker 1:  I have, I have different, the, let me throw two theories at you. Yeah. And

215
00:13:22,545 --> 00:13:25,585
Speaker 1:  I, I, and I wanna see if what you think about either of these. I think

216
00:13:26,355 --> 00:13:29,625
Speaker 1:  there is one theory that holds that

217
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:34,265
Speaker 1:  actually the people who play PC games and the people who

218
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:38,185
Speaker 1:  want a relatively speaking low powered machine

219
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:41,985
Speaker 1:  for playing games on the go is like the, those Venn

220
00:13:41,985 --> 00:13:45,785
Speaker 1:  diagrams do not overlap at all. Right? Like if I'm the person who is building

221
00:13:45,905 --> 00:13:49,745
Speaker 1:  a gaming tower to play games on my giant

222
00:13:49,925 --> 00:13:53,865
Speaker 1:  screen with my integrated GPU, I don't want a Windows handheld

223
00:13:53,865 --> 00:13:57,545
Speaker 1:  because it won't play the games the way that I want. That's one theory. I'm

224
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,225
Speaker 1:  not positive how much I buy that theory, but that's one theory. The other

225
00:14:00,225 --> 00:14:03,545
Speaker 1:  theory is just that these devices aren't very good. And

226
00:14:04,105 --> 00:14:07,385
Speaker 1:  I think the, which is why I wanna talk about the Steam Deck, because I think

227
00:14:07,385 --> 00:14:10,865
Speaker 1:  the question of how good is the Steam Deck really is actually like the most

228
00:14:11,145 --> 00:14:14,985
Speaker 1:  interesting question in this category right now because all the other

229
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:18,945
Speaker 1:  ones seem to suck in, in one form or another. Like you just reviewed

230
00:14:18,965 --> 00:14:22,825
Speaker 1:  the, the Lenovo Legion Go s which was supposed to be the one and

231
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:26,785
Speaker 1:  super Duper isn't the one. And it, it just seems to me that

232
00:14:26,785 --> 00:14:30,225
Speaker 1:  maybe what is happening is this is like a discerning group of people

233
00:14:30,645 --> 00:14:34,625
Speaker 1:  who would want something like this right now. And they're looking at all

234
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:38,545
Speaker 1:  of these devices and saying, oh, these are bad. I'm not going

235
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,985
Speaker 1:  to buy any of them. Is it just that simple?

236
00:14:41,545 --> 00:14:45,185
Speaker 5:  I wanna accept but also reject this idea

237
00:14:45,255 --> 00:14:48,345
Speaker 5:  that these things aren't very good. That, that it's like such a discerning

238
00:14:48,505 --> 00:14:52,205
Speaker 5:  audience. Okay. What I see anecdotally,

239
00:14:52,665 --> 00:14:56,165
Speaker 5:  but all the time are reports of people,

240
00:14:56,945 --> 00:15:00,205
Speaker 5:  you know, in Reddits and social media, in my comments in

241
00:15:00,785 --> 00:15:04,765
Speaker 5:  et cetera saying, my gosh, I didn't know I could

242
00:15:04,825 --> 00:15:08,405
Speaker 5:  do this kind of gaming on the go. Or I'm

243
00:15:08,555 --> 00:15:12,325
Speaker 5:  elapsed game PC gamer or, or a console gamer who never got

244
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:16,085
Speaker 5:  into the PC space to begin with. And wow, there's just

245
00:15:16,085 --> 00:15:19,805
Speaker 5:  this, all these riches at my fingertips now. All these riches, literally

246
00:15:19,805 --> 00:15:23,565
Speaker 5:  the palm of my hands I'm taking with me everywhere. I

247
00:15:23,565 --> 00:15:26,965
Speaker 5:  don't see a hundred of these every time I walk into an airport. Sure. These

248
00:15:26,965 --> 00:15:29,405
Speaker 5:  days I'm seeing like two or three when I walk into the airport, I'm like,

249
00:15:29,405 --> 00:15:33,045
Speaker 5:  okay, that's great. It's great to see that many of them. I think that if,

250
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:36,285
Speaker 5:  if, if, if I were to put my finger on one thing, I think it's awareness

251
00:15:37,195 --> 00:15:40,845
Speaker 5:  that a good one of these exists that the Steam

252
00:15:40,915 --> 00:15:44,685
Speaker 5:  Deck is very good or that one

253
00:15:44,705 --> 00:15:48,085
Speaker 5:  of the windows handhelds with a Steam Deck like os on It

254
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:52,125
Speaker 5:  is very good, fair that, that, that's like a, a a nerdy niche, which most

255
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,725
Speaker 5:  people are not gonna go. That they're not gonna go install Bazi on their,

256
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,965
Speaker 5:  on their thing and ex right? And if, if they're coming from the I'm aaps

257
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:01,565
Speaker 5:  PC gamer, they're probably not going all the way to Bazi right away. I think

258
00:16:01,565 --> 00:16:05,325
Speaker 5:  that that message could well be getting washed out

259
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:09,765
Speaker 5:  by a bunch of other things that seem to suck. Because if I'm

260
00:16:09,765 --> 00:16:13,405
Speaker 5:  getting into this market and I'm like, handhelds are super cool

261
00:16:14,025 --> 00:16:18,005
Speaker 5:  and my first, and, and and, and then I go to a store and I look for a handheld,

262
00:16:18,265 --> 00:16:22,085
Speaker 5:  and that handheld is the original ROG ally or the

263
00:16:22,325 --> 00:16:26,285
Speaker 5:  original Legion Go and, and I'm like, oh, I heard

264
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:29,645
Speaker 5:  about this Steam Deck thing, but windows windows are where my games are and

265
00:16:29,645 --> 00:16:33,485
Speaker 5:  that windows thing looks great and, and, and it looks like it's

266
00:16:33,485 --> 00:16:37,285
Speaker 5:  not too much money either those things are on sale. I might well go

267
00:16:37,305 --> 00:16:41,005
Speaker 5:  buy that Asos RG Ally or Lenovo Legion go and then be like,

268
00:16:41,915 --> 00:16:45,885
Speaker 5:  what is this bullshit? The battery dies after like an hour.

269
00:16:46,935 --> 00:16:50,005
Speaker 5:  These these controls feel a little bit weird in my hands.

270
00:16:51,765 --> 00:16:55,645
Speaker 5:  I have to touch the screen constantly to get to, to make things,

271
00:16:55,825 --> 00:16:59,085
Speaker 5:  to go where I want and to launch this program and, and to like,

272
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:03,125
Speaker 5:  I have to, when when you open the box on one of these things, you, you plug

273
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:06,925
Speaker 5:  it in, you turn on your As or your, your Lenovo and then you

274
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:10,805
Speaker 5:  spend 45 minutes installing mandatory updates and adding

275
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:14,805
Speaker 5:  away prompts for black dark pattern prompts for various pieces

276
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:18,485
Speaker 5:  of Microsoft software that you don't want subscriptions that you would never

277
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:22,445
Speaker 5:  pay for before you even get to the windows of desktop to begin

278
00:17:22,445 --> 00:17:26,125
Speaker 5:  installing your games through game launchers that may not be there yet. And

279
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,685
Speaker 5:  then you have to go and touchscreen your way through a web browser to go

280
00:17:28,885 --> 00:17:32,805
Speaker 5:  download them first. And what is this bullshit? If that is your

281
00:17:32,805 --> 00:17:36,645
Speaker 5:  first experience getting into handheld gaming, handheld PC of gaming,

282
00:17:37,105 --> 00:17:40,925
Speaker 5:  you're gonna think that the whole category is, is bullshit too. And

283
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:45,445
Speaker 5:  I don't know why Microsoft has not addressed this meaningfully. If you

284
00:17:45,445 --> 00:17:49,165
Speaker 5:  instead trust a company that's mostly known

285
00:17:49,305 --> 00:17:52,285
Speaker 5:  for games, not for hardware and has had some

286
00:17:53,215 --> 00:17:56,725
Speaker 5:  weird failings in hardware in the past to

287
00:17:57,165 --> 00:18:01,045
Speaker 5:  ship you a console that uses Linux, an operating system that you're

288
00:18:01,045 --> 00:18:04,965
Speaker 5:  likely wholly unfamiliar with and do not know whether it will

289
00:18:04,965 --> 00:18:08,805
Speaker 5:  play your games. And in some cases people will rightfully say will not

290
00:18:08,805 --> 00:18:11,605
Speaker 5:  play certain games. It did not play your fifa. It did not, it's not gonna

291
00:18:11,605 --> 00:18:15,485
Speaker 5:  play. Yeah. It, it, it's not gonna play your, your Call of duty, which

292
00:18:15,905 --> 00:18:19,285
Speaker 5:  you please do not try to play Call of Duty on a seven inch screen

293
00:18:20,325 --> 00:18:24,125
Speaker 5:  regardless of whether it's Windows or Linux. Right? If you

294
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:28,165
Speaker 5:  jump through the mental hoops of, ooh, there

295
00:18:28,165 --> 00:18:32,125
Speaker 5:  seems to be a lot of mental friction here. And then you turn that thing on,

296
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:36,365
Speaker 5:  you will be confronted with a wonderful experience that is designed

297
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:40,525
Speaker 5:  for handheld gaming and plays lots of games you can get very

298
00:18:40,635 --> 00:18:44,205
Speaker 5:  cheaply. Games often will come out on PC before they

299
00:18:44,485 --> 00:18:48,405
Speaker 5:  come out on consoles if they are, especially from the indie variety. Like

300
00:18:48,405 --> 00:18:52,165
Speaker 5:  if you wanted to play tro, which is now an amazing addiction on phones.

301
00:18:52,345 --> 00:18:56,205
Speaker 5:  Yep. It was an incredible addiction on handhelds like the Steam Deck first.

302
00:18:56,515 --> 00:19:00,245
Speaker 1:  Totally. So I, that's a really interesting way of thinking about it. 'cause

303
00:19:00,245 --> 00:19:03,965
Speaker 1:  I think that is a piece of that that is just like these

304
00:19:03,965 --> 00:19:07,885
Speaker 1:  devices make you ask a lot of questions and ensure a lot of

305
00:19:07,885 --> 00:19:11,725
Speaker 1:  things that buying a PlayStation doesn't, right? Like you buy

306
00:19:11,765 --> 00:19:14,445
Speaker 1:  a PlayStation and that you are going to plug it in and It is going to play

307
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:18,285
Speaker 1:  all of your games the way It is supposed to play your games and the

308
00:19:18,285 --> 00:19:21,965
Speaker 1:  whole handheld space, even the things that do that

309
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:25,885
Speaker 1:  passively well, it's not as straightforward and

310
00:19:25,885 --> 00:19:29,125
Speaker 1:  simple and obvious and you have to just crosscheck

311
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:33,085
Speaker 1:  compatibility and quality and do a lot more work.

312
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:36,965
Speaker 1:  So what we need then, this is where I come around to like where on earth

313
00:19:36,965 --> 00:19:40,805
Speaker 1:  are Sony and Microsoft in doing this? Because what we need

314
00:19:40,865 --> 00:19:44,605
Speaker 1:  is the thing that is just the simple one. And, and my next

315
00:19:44,805 --> 00:19:47,845
Speaker 1:  question for you was gonna be why hasn't the Switch

316
00:19:48,915 --> 00:19:51,885
Speaker 1:  sort of turned everybody onto the idea that this is a thing that's possible

317
00:19:51,885 --> 00:19:54,845
Speaker 1:  because it's been so successful, it's been out for a long time. It is truly

318
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:58,005
Speaker 1:  mainstream. The idea that like I can hold this device in my hands and play

319
00:19:58,005 --> 00:20:01,885
Speaker 1:  video games. But I think it's also true that Nintendo just sort of permanently

320
00:20:01,885 --> 00:20:05,685
Speaker 1:  exists off to the side of the rest of the gaming world. So what we need

321
00:20:05,685 --> 00:20:09,445
Speaker 1:  is something that is as straightforward and simple and mainstream

322
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,405
Speaker 1:  as the switch, but for these other kinds of games. And that is the thing

323
00:20:13,405 --> 00:20:17,285
Speaker 1:  I feel like the Steam Deck has not yet accomplished. And it

324
00:20:17,285 --> 00:20:18,165
Speaker 1:  seems like you agree with that.

325
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:22,445
Speaker 5:  The Steam Deck has not accomplished it in the market yet, but

326
00:20:22,445 --> 00:20:25,525
Speaker 5:  it has accomplished becoming the wake up call

327
00:20:26,345 --> 00:20:29,445
Speaker 5:  for those companies you just named for Microsoft. Okay. And for Sony,

328
00:20:30,285 --> 00:20:34,125
Speaker 5:  Microsoft and Sony for a very long time have known the

329
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:38,045
Speaker 5:  wisdom in the industry is that you cannot compete

330
00:20:38,045 --> 00:20:41,765
Speaker 5:  with Nintendo on a handheld. Every

331
00:20:41,765 --> 00:20:45,485
Speaker 5:  handheld that is faced off against Nintendo from the earliest game Boy days

332
00:20:46,185 --> 00:20:49,805
Speaker 5:  has utterly failed beyond. That's interesting.

333
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:54,125
Speaker 5:  A very specific pair of niches. The PS

334
00:20:54,305 --> 00:20:58,045
Speaker 5:  VDA was what had a wonderful niche of indie games.

335
00:20:58,785 --> 00:21:02,645
Speaker 5:  And both the PS VDA and PSP had a a, an a

336
00:21:02,645 --> 00:21:06,485
Speaker 5:  great niche in Japan very specifically and, and some

337
00:21:06,485 --> 00:21:10,125
Speaker 5:  other countries that that rely heavily on wonderful

338
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,965
Speaker 5:  transit, public transit when you have

339
00:21:14,165 --> 00:21:18,085
Speaker 5:  a public transit country where handheld gaming is

340
00:21:18,605 --> 00:21:22,245
Speaker 5:  valuable and you might have several other people on that train with you to

341
00:21:22,245 --> 00:21:26,205
Speaker 5:  do like local network things together. Mm. The DS Light did a

342
00:21:26,205 --> 00:21:29,765
Speaker 5:  great job of that from Nintendo, but also the PSP and Vita did some, some,

343
00:21:29,765 --> 00:21:33,485
Speaker 5:  some good jobs of that for Sony. But for the most part,

344
00:21:33,745 --> 00:21:37,725
Speaker 5:  for the entire history of handheld gaming, the collective wisdom has been

345
00:21:37,935 --> 00:21:41,845
Speaker 5:  don't mess with Nintendo. And if you are going to make a

346
00:21:41,845 --> 00:21:45,805
Speaker 5:  handheld, it's the place that you, you shovel things that, that

347
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:49,605
Speaker 5:  aren't going to maybe do as well on your, on your big console, you'll,

348
00:21:49,605 --> 00:21:52,645
Speaker 5:  you'll make, you'll make some games for that thing. But they have to be,

349
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:56,605
Speaker 5:  you know, small ports of things that you know, that you think

350
00:21:56,605 --> 00:22:00,565
Speaker 5:  might might work there. And, and, and anytime you spend one of

351
00:22:00,565 --> 00:22:04,245
Speaker 5:  your game ideas there like, like gravity rush on on Navita

352
00:22:04,985 --> 00:22:08,885
Speaker 5:  or or or Uncharted on Navita as well, those games are going to be

353
00:22:09,035 --> 00:22:11,725
Speaker 5:  watered down versions. 'cause you don't wanna put your A teams on that. You

354
00:22:11,725 --> 00:22:15,325
Speaker 5:  don't wanna take too much ammunition away from your primary console to do

355
00:22:15,325 --> 00:22:19,065
Speaker 5:  that. Well first with Nintendo and now with

356
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:22,905
Speaker 5:  the Steam Deck, the realization is that

357
00:22:23,155 --> 00:22:27,065
Speaker 5:  maybe handheld gaming is the future. Maybe this is an

358
00:22:27,135 --> 00:22:29,945
Speaker 5:  existential crisis for them. If they don't have

359
00:22:30,935 --> 00:22:34,815
Speaker 5:  some irons in that fire then maybe they miss out on

360
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:38,895
Speaker 5:  what gaming is all becoming. Hmm. Because the switch and

361
00:22:39,055 --> 00:22:41,895
Speaker 5:  the Steam Deck again prove that it doesn't have to be the port of the game.

362
00:22:42,355 --> 00:22:46,295
Speaker 5:  It doesn't have to be your B team putting a game on there. It can

363
00:22:46,295 --> 00:22:49,785
Speaker 5:  be any game that runs on your

364
00:22:50,765 --> 00:22:54,255
Speaker 5:  main system. Any game that doesn't require the horsepower

365
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:58,095
Speaker 5:  of a constant AC plug into the wall

366
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:02,375
Speaker 5:  that can be portable now and portable

367
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:06,545
Speaker 5:  also doesn't have to mean outside of the house. It can mean your couch. For

368
00:23:06,545 --> 00:23:10,505
Speaker 5:  many people it means your couch. So Sony got started with

369
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:14,225
Speaker 5:  the PlayStation portal for those couch folks, right? And the portal for all

370
00:23:14,225 --> 00:23:17,705
Speaker 5:  we know may have sold better than all these CK big handouts so far.

371
00:23:18,285 --> 00:23:21,805
Speaker 5:  But it right now it just plays your, your game streamed from your

372
00:23:21,805 --> 00:23:25,565
Speaker 5:  PlayStation box. You're on the couch with somebody else. Maybe they're

373
00:23:25,725 --> 00:23:26,925
Speaker 5:  watching tv, it's

374
00:23:26,925 --> 00:23:30,405
Speaker 1:  A controller with a screen much more than It is like an actual console. Yeah,

375
00:23:30,515 --> 00:23:33,605
Speaker 5:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it, but it lets you beep with somebody else who's watching

376
00:23:33,665 --> 00:23:37,125
Speaker 5:  TV on the main screen and then you can do the thing next, which is also what

377
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:40,205
Speaker 5:  I do with the Steam Deck and I also stream my PlayStation from the Steam

378
00:23:40,205 --> 00:23:42,805
Speaker 5:  Deck because by the way, the Steam Deck doubles as the PlayStation portal.

379
00:23:42,825 --> 00:23:46,565
Speaker 5:  If you install the right app Chiaki, go look it up. It's amazing. There you

380
00:23:46,565 --> 00:23:49,845
Speaker 5:  go. Now they also know they need to make

381
00:23:50,835 --> 00:23:54,565
Speaker 5:  real handouts and both Microsoft and

382
00:23:54,715 --> 00:23:58,685
Speaker 5:  Sony one praised the Steam Deck as

383
00:23:58,685 --> 00:24:01,765
Speaker 5:  it came out and was like, this is great. We're gonna put some of our games

384
00:24:01,765 --> 00:24:05,645
Speaker 5:  on there. 'cause they want that money from the games. Right Now both Sony

385
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:09,605
Speaker 5:  and Microsoft have realized that putting games on PC is basically

386
00:24:10,525 --> 00:24:13,245
Speaker 5:  existing games on pc. They're existing PlayStation games, they're existing

387
00:24:13,315 --> 00:24:16,725
Speaker 5:  Xbox games, they put them on pc, it's like printing free money for the most

388
00:24:16,725 --> 00:24:20,045
Speaker 5:  part. There's a little bit of work involved in, you know, in getting it ported

389
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:24,085
Speaker 5:  properly, but pretty much printing free money. And both of their

390
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:28,245
Speaker 5:  strategies have shifted over the years from we have to sell a

391
00:24:28,505 --> 00:24:32,365
Speaker 5:  box and the box will have an attached rate of games for sure. That

392
00:24:32,365 --> 00:24:36,085
Speaker 5:  justify making the box to, we want to be in the business of

393
00:24:36,085 --> 00:24:39,645
Speaker 5:  selling games. The Xbox is every

394
00:24:39,705 --> 00:24:43,485
Speaker 5:  screen you own, right? That's what Microsoft says. Not just internally but

395
00:24:43,485 --> 00:24:47,085
Speaker 5:  in its advertising. Now Sony's been moving that direction too.

396
00:24:48,225 --> 00:24:51,805
Speaker 5:  And so both of them praised it. They started putting their games

397
00:24:52,145 --> 00:24:54,925
Speaker 5:  on it. They started not only putting their games on but, but making sure

398
00:24:54,925 --> 00:24:58,565
Speaker 5:  the games ran well on a handheld form factor. Making them

399
00:24:59,175 --> 00:25:02,805
Speaker 5:  Steam Deck, you know, verified and they've dropped

400
00:25:03,015 --> 00:25:06,755
Speaker 5:  hints that they will have bigger handhelds

401
00:25:07,045 --> 00:25:10,795
Speaker 5:  later. The reports, which I should cite both of them to

402
00:25:10,795 --> 00:25:14,755
Speaker 5:  Bloomberg by the way, are that Sony and Microsoft will have

403
00:25:14,755 --> 00:25:18,515
Speaker 5:  something in the next few years. Not right away, it's not a

404
00:25:18,635 --> 00:25:21,915
Speaker 5:  reason to not buy something existing right now, but in the next few years

405
00:25:21,915 --> 00:25:25,395
Speaker 5:  they're both looking into this, they're both building around this, what

406
00:25:25,395 --> 00:25:29,235
Speaker 1:  Is the holdup here? Like the, the Steam Deck has been out long

407
00:25:29,235 --> 00:25:33,195
Speaker 1:  enough that people are demanding a new one because it seems to be

408
00:25:33,195 --> 00:25:37,035
Speaker 1:  at the end of a cycle before there should be a new one. And yet

409
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:40,955
Speaker 1:  we're still at a few years for Sony and Microsoft. And I think the, the reason

410
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:44,875
Speaker 1:  I'm particularly interested in this is from Microsoft's perspective because

411
00:25:45,185 --> 00:25:48,555
Speaker 1:  like you said, Microsoft is on this whole game pass

412
00:25:49,055 --> 00:25:52,955
Speaker 1:  all your games everywhere, every screen is an Xbox thing and it strikes me

413
00:25:52,955 --> 00:25:56,515
Speaker 1:  as the most obvious thing in the world for

414
00:25:57,035 --> 00:26:00,195
Speaker 1:  Microsoft to just build a handheld console and say, well you're streaming

415
00:26:00,195 --> 00:26:03,315
Speaker 1:  most of your games anyway. You don't even need a ton of power. Here is what

416
00:26:03,315 --> 00:26:07,155
Speaker 1:  amounts to a controller with a screen. Let's go nuts. And yet we're

417
00:26:07,155 --> 00:26:10,555
Speaker 1:  still at a few years out like it did. That just does not make sense to me.

418
00:26:11,775 --> 00:26:15,435
Speaker 5:  My, my gut is that it's infighting. I think, I think not every,

419
00:26:15,795 --> 00:26:18,355
Speaker 5:  I think not every team at these companies convinced there have been some

420
00:26:18,355 --> 00:26:21,875
Speaker 5:  major restructurings at Sony recently

421
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:26,755
Speaker 5:  in terms of like who, which, which people have the power and which

422
00:26:26,755 --> 00:26:30,435
Speaker 5:  departments. It's Sony Interactive Entertainment, I should say the

423
00:26:30,895 --> 00:26:34,795
Speaker 5:  the games arm, PlayStation we call it. And then on the

424
00:26:34,985 --> 00:26:37,795
Speaker 5:  Xbox side of things, there's always been infighting forever.

425
00:26:38,225 --> 00:26:41,515
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Microsoft, not famously the chillest company in the world. Yeah.

426
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:45,765
Speaker 5:  And and the key thing there has always been

427
00:26:46,995 --> 00:26:50,845
Speaker 5:  Windows versus Xbox and more recently Windows versus

428
00:26:51,205 --> 00:26:55,085
Speaker 5:  services versus Xbox. And so there's

429
00:26:55,085 --> 00:26:58,925
Speaker 5:  been, there's been the question of do you make an Xbox

430
00:26:59,245 --> 00:27:02,645
Speaker 5:  handheld or do you make a Windows handheld?

431
00:27:03,105 --> 00:27:06,805
Speaker 5:  Do you make both and have them cannibalize each other and you know,

432
00:27:06,865 --> 00:27:10,405
Speaker 5:  dilute your marketing message? Do you let the handheld cannibalize the

433
00:27:10,635 --> 00:27:14,365
Speaker 5:  Xbox? All of these kinds of conversations have probably been

434
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:18,165
Speaker 5:  percolating for years now. Totally. There are, there are

435
00:27:18,165 --> 00:27:21,885
Speaker 5:  some canceled devices in the past too. I mean we, we, we reported on Xbox

436
00:27:21,885 --> 00:27:25,525
Speaker 5:  tablet years ago. We reported on Xbox streaming stick. They,

437
00:27:25,525 --> 00:27:29,365
Speaker 5:  they've thought about ways to, you know, to branch this out and at the end

438
00:27:29,365 --> 00:27:33,205
Speaker 5:  of the day they've, they've canceled the ones we've heard about

439
00:27:33,355 --> 00:27:37,125
Speaker 5:  rumored coming out at some point in the future. There, there have always

440
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:41,085
Speaker 5:  been questions about, you know, whether they can just go straight to

441
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:45,005
Speaker 5:  streaming instead of local performance hardware. Which is also

442
00:27:45,075 --> 00:27:48,885
Speaker 5:  very key if you're building a handheld because you think in

443
00:27:48,885 --> 00:27:52,445
Speaker 5:  three years the world is going to be streaming all its games over the internet.

444
00:27:52,465 --> 00:27:56,045
Speaker 5:  You're building a very different handheld than if you're assuming that people

445
00:27:56,045 --> 00:27:59,485
Speaker 5:  are going to have to run that game on the actual hardware with all of that

446
00:27:59,485 --> 00:28:00,965
Speaker 5:  performance that's required for it.

447
00:28:02,845 --> 00:28:06,725
Speaker 5:  Historically, cloud gaming has gotten better over time in terms of

448
00:28:06,725 --> 00:28:10,685
Speaker 5:  the image quality. But at the end of the day it's, it's, there's so

449
00:28:10,685 --> 00:28:14,045
Speaker 5:  many like friction questions in people's minds of what's gonna work. Will

450
00:28:14,045 --> 00:28:17,925
Speaker 5:  I own my games? Is your house close enough to the

451
00:28:17,925 --> 00:28:21,685
Speaker 5:  servers? What happens if other people in your house suddenly use the internet?

452
00:28:21,685 --> 00:28:25,205
Speaker 5:  People's home routers and wifi points aren't really

453
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:29,845
Speaker 5:  designed to be like, I'm going to make sure that this one device's connection

454
00:28:29,845 --> 00:28:33,805
Speaker 5:  is rock solid unless you are an IT admin setting that up at

455
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:37,965
Speaker 5:  your own home with that proper quality of service. Nvidia and ex

456
00:28:38,285 --> 00:28:41,325
Speaker 5:  Microsoft have worked on baking some of that into the routers, some of that

457
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:45,205
Speaker 5:  you know, but you can't expect the average person to buy one of those things

458
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:49,165
Speaker 5:  and just have it work yet. And that we don't know when that's going to change.

459
00:28:49,705 --> 00:28:53,125
Speaker 5:  So I don't know how far Microsoft is down that road,

460
00:28:53,945 --> 00:28:57,325
Speaker 5:  but we did, so at CS we caught up with Jason

461
00:28:57,745 --> 00:29:01,405
Speaker 5:  Ronald whose title is VP of Next Generation

462
00:29:01,985 --> 00:29:05,765
Speaker 5:  at Xbox and he says that the idea

463
00:29:05,825 --> 00:29:09,125
Speaker 5:  is going to be bringing the best of Xbox to Windows.

464
00:29:10,075 --> 00:29:13,245
Speaker 5:  Okay. So boiling that down,

465
00:29:14,355 --> 00:29:17,845
Speaker 5:  they still wanna do the big platform play where

466
00:29:18,755 --> 00:29:22,685
Speaker 5:  they help a lot of Windows handhelds happen, which is great for

467
00:29:22,685 --> 00:29:25,765
Speaker 5:  them 'cause they sell Windows licenses on those handhelds and then they sell

468
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:29,365
Speaker 5:  Windows subscription services and apps and they can say it's also a PC and

469
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:33,365
Speaker 5:  all these kinds of things. But the big problem with Windows

470
00:29:33,365 --> 00:29:37,165
Speaker 5:  right now is you turn it on and it's Windows and they would like what you

471
00:29:37,185 --> 00:29:41,045
Speaker 5:  see to be Xbox. They would like what you see and I would like what

472
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:44,925
Speaker 5:  you see to be here are your games instead of here is

473
00:29:44,925 --> 00:29:47,605
Speaker 5:  45 minutes of installation and prompts, right?

474
00:29:47,675 --> 00:29:51,405
Speaker 1:  It's like set top boxes. Like when when I turn on the thing, you should show

475
00:29:51,405 --> 00:29:55,005
Speaker 1:  me the things that I am here for and nothing else. It's pretty simple.

476
00:29:55,435 --> 00:29:59,125
Speaker 5:  There's so many things on top of that that you could theoretically do. And

477
00:29:59,345 --> 00:30:02,765
Speaker 5:  the Steam Deck does that. I don't think a Windows

478
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:06,525
Speaker 5:  handheld that is Xbox Tomorrow would necessarily do.

479
00:30:06,985 --> 00:30:10,485
Speaker 5:  The Steam Deck has touch pads, two of them

480
00:30:11,035 --> 00:30:14,525
Speaker 5:  that let you play decades of PC games more easily because

481
00:30:15,155 --> 00:30:18,645
Speaker 5:  many of them expect you to have a mouse cursor to do things.

482
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:23,605
Speaker 5:  Steam Valve has worked tirelessly to make sure that the

483
00:30:23,605 --> 00:30:27,205
Speaker 5:  controls are the most customizable not just of any handheld but of

484
00:30:27,545 --> 00:30:31,445
Speaker 5:  any gaming device ever made. So that you can map

485
00:30:31,505 --> 00:30:35,125
Speaker 5:  any of them to do any number of things and not just map one to one, but also

486
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:38,645
Speaker 5:  create cords, multi key chords that do various things

487
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:42,525
Speaker 5:  or fine tune exactly how far

488
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:46,925
Speaker 5:  your character or camera turn when you move it this much based on the

489
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:50,965
Speaker 5:  gyroscope. I have a setup in a first person shooter game, which by the way

490
00:30:50,965 --> 00:30:53,725
Speaker 5:  you can play first person shooter games on a Steam Deck because of Gyro,

491
00:30:53,725 --> 00:30:57,405
Speaker 5:  because of Wonderful Gyro I can set up so that when I do a quick movement

492
00:30:57,505 --> 00:31:01,205
Speaker 5:  or press a certain button, it will rotate me exactly 180 degrees in the game

493
00:31:01,385 --> 00:31:05,045
Speaker 5:  or exactly 90 degrees to the left or right snap turns and things like that.

494
00:31:05,935 --> 00:31:08,765
Speaker 5:  There are layers upon layers of

495
00:31:09,725 --> 00:31:13,525
Speaker 5:  customizability that you can do there. And they've set up a community

496
00:31:13,795 --> 00:31:17,605
Speaker 5:  profile system where if you don't wanna spend any time mapping

497
00:31:17,685 --> 00:31:21,445
Speaker 5:  controls, you can just load a set that somebody else has made

498
00:31:21,585 --> 00:31:24,725
Speaker 5:  and upload it to the internet and be like, oh, I wonder what this does here

499
00:31:24,725 --> 00:31:28,005
Speaker 5:  is the mapping. It shows right you on a, on a, on like a picture of the Steam

500
00:31:28,005 --> 00:31:31,245
Speaker 5:  Deck, here's how all these things work. And you're like, oh that sounds great.

501
00:31:31,245 --> 00:31:34,405
Speaker 5:  I'll download that and try that. Wow that one didn't work for me. May download

502
00:31:34,405 --> 00:31:38,085
Speaker 5:  another one, try that right now I have controls that feel native to this

503
00:31:38,085 --> 00:31:41,885
Speaker 5:  system for a 10, 15-year-old PC game. If you

504
00:31:41,885 --> 00:31:45,285
Speaker 5:  want. The other thing that I think will be

505
00:31:45,635 --> 00:31:49,405
Speaker 5:  difficult for Microsoft to do if they just attack this

506
00:31:49,705 --> 00:31:53,005
Speaker 5:  as here is a new layer we're adding on top of Windows

507
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:57,285
Speaker 5:  is that many games don't run as well on Windows.

508
00:31:58,185 --> 00:32:02,125
Speaker 5:  Let me back up. Many Windows games do

509
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:06,085
Speaker 5:  not run as well on Windows as they currently do on

510
00:32:06,285 --> 00:32:08,405
Speaker 5:  Linux on a Steam Deck. Seems

511
00:32:08,545 --> 00:32:11,405
Speaker 1:  Bad, Sean seems bad. It's not great,

512
00:32:12,075 --> 00:32:16,045
Speaker 5:  It's not great. Recently I, I had somebody from Microsoft reach out

513
00:32:16,045 --> 00:32:19,045
Speaker 5:  to me about my Lenovo Legion go benchmarks and ask me,

514
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:23,125
Speaker 5:  are you sure you turned off this setting and benched it that way? 'cause

515
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:25,645
Speaker 5:  we've noticed some errant behavior. And I'm like, yep, notice that behavior.

516
00:32:25,645 --> 00:32:27,605
Speaker 5:  That's why I turned it off every time.

517
00:32:28,515 --> 00:32:31,765
Speaker 1:  That's rough. So this makes me think that

518
00:32:32,545 --> 00:32:36,265
Speaker 1:  the Steam Deck and Valve in general is maybe

519
00:32:36,295 --> 00:32:40,285
Speaker 1:  like one very big marketing budget away from being able

520
00:32:40,305 --> 00:32:44,005
Speaker 1:  to make this thing happen because I, I think in a very real way, like

521
00:32:44,735 --> 00:32:48,485
Speaker 1:  there is Xbox, there is PlayStation and then there's a huge big

522
00:32:48,535 --> 00:32:52,325
Speaker 1:  giant monster gap all the way down to everything else in terms of like the

523
00:32:52,325 --> 00:32:56,125
Speaker 1:  way that people think about gaming brands and if your valve your

524
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:59,485
Speaker 1:  options are, don't try to compete with that or

525
00:32:59,795 --> 00:33:03,525
Speaker 1:  basically spend billions of dollars trying to compete with that. And at least

526
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:06,525
Speaker 1:  from what I've understood of Valve over the years, it's not interested in

527
00:33:07,075 --> 00:33:10,805
Speaker 1:  like having Super Bowl commercials every year where it tells you about Steam

528
00:33:10,805 --> 00:33:14,565
Speaker 1:  Deck. But it also seems like based on sort of your

529
00:33:14,565 --> 00:33:18,285
Speaker 1:  experience, and again, what we've seen in these IDC numbers is like to the

530
00:33:18,285 --> 00:33:22,095
Speaker 1:  extent that this market exists, the Steam Deck is winning it.

531
00:33:22,475 --> 00:33:26,095
Speaker 1:  And if I'm valve what I should be doing is saying we have a pretty commanding

532
00:33:26,095 --> 00:33:29,535
Speaker 1:  lead here. What we need to do is grow this market as fast as possible because

533
00:33:29,535 --> 00:33:31,815
Speaker 1:  everybody thinks it's gonna be the next thing and somehow

534
00:33:33,475 --> 00:33:36,455
Speaker 1:  no one else is doing a good job. And so it's like,

535
00:33:37,225 --> 00:33:41,095
Speaker 1:  where where is valve pouring gasoline on this fire to make it

536
00:33:41,215 --> 00:33:42,255
Speaker 1:  a bigger thing all of a sudden?

537
00:33:43,005 --> 00:33:46,775
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I mean to some degree I really think

538
00:33:46,805 --> 00:33:50,655
Speaker 5:  that if there were, you know, demo stations in every Best Buy around the

539
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:54,375
Speaker 5:  country and if there were, you know,

540
00:33:54,605 --> 00:33:58,375
Speaker 5:  mall pop-up stores and things like that, that yeah, they could

541
00:33:58,375 --> 00:34:02,295
Speaker 5:  sell a lot more of these. On the other hand, I don't know how much

542
00:34:02,295 --> 00:34:04,855
Speaker 5:  they care about pouring gasoline on fires.

543
00:34:05,235 --> 00:34:05,655
Speaker 1:  That's

544
00:34:05,655 --> 00:34:09,535
Speaker 5:  Fair. They're a very small company. They're, I don't wanna say they're

545
00:34:09,535 --> 00:34:13,095
Speaker 5:  very focused because, because one of the tenets of Valve

546
00:34:13,515 --> 00:34:17,415
Speaker 5:  is that you can physically or virtually roll your desk around

547
00:34:17,515 --> 00:34:20,455
Speaker 5:  to different jobs there if you want. Oh, that's right. Yeah, yeah. This is

548
00:34:20,455 --> 00:34:23,015
Speaker 5:  this. They put, they, they put it out in a handbook. They released, I wanna,

549
00:34:23,055 --> 00:34:26,015
Speaker 5:  I wanna say in 2012, I guess they wanted to attract some new employees at

550
00:34:26,015 --> 00:34:28,535
Speaker 5:  that point and they're like, oh yeah, if it ever snows you don't come into

551
00:34:28,535 --> 00:34:31,335
Speaker 5:  work. This was before remote work was really a thing. You just work from

552
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:35,255
Speaker 5:  home. If, if, if you want to join a new project. The way we

553
00:34:35,255 --> 00:34:38,175
Speaker 5:  do new projects around here is somebody will say, I've got a new project

554
00:34:38,275 --> 00:34:41,815
Speaker 5:  and people roll their desk over there and the projects that have the most

555
00:34:41,865 --> 00:34:45,815
Speaker 5:  desks are the ones that we're, we're working on. So, 'cause all the desks

556
00:34:45,815 --> 00:34:48,575
Speaker 5:  have wheels and they decided to do it that way. A little different now they're

557
00:34:48,575 --> 00:34:51,535
Speaker 5:  a little more distributed, but I hear the rolling desks are still a thing.

558
00:34:51,535 --> 00:34:54,375
Speaker 5:  Okay. As of the last time I was there in 2023. So

559
00:34:55,735 --> 00:34:59,495
Speaker 5:  I don't wanna say that they're, they're focused, but I do wanna say that

560
00:34:59,495 --> 00:35:03,255
Speaker 5:  something like that would require a lot of concerted effort

561
00:35:04,085 --> 00:35:07,735
Speaker 5:  from the kinds of people that may be Valve doesn't spend

562
00:35:07,895 --> 00:35:11,095
Speaker 5:  all its time hiring, it doesn't spend on

563
00:35:12,045 --> 00:35:15,975
Speaker 5:  marketing so much or retail. It's not, it's not its

564
00:35:15,975 --> 00:35:19,815
Speaker 5:  thing it wants to build, it wants to build games and certainly

565
00:35:20,095 --> 00:35:23,055
Speaker 5:  somebody could step in and say, hey, you know, best Buy could say, oh, we'll

566
00:35:23,055 --> 00:35:26,615
Speaker 5:  do it for you. But Valve also wants to have pretty

567
00:35:26,635 --> 00:35:30,375
Speaker 5:  strong degree of control. They wanna make sure the message is right. They

568
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:34,335
Speaker 5:  wanna make sure they're, they're seen as this benevolent entity, which many

569
00:35:34,515 --> 00:35:38,285
Speaker 5:  PC gamers are happy to hold them up as because you know,

570
00:35:38,385 --> 00:35:42,165
Speaker 5:  hey, this Steam Deck wouldn't exist without them and look at all the, the

571
00:35:42,165 --> 00:35:46,085
Speaker 5:  way they handle themselves with this game and that game and they

572
00:35:46,085 --> 00:35:49,045
Speaker 5:  must have poured a ton of money into this that they're not recouping to make

573
00:35:49,045 --> 00:35:52,005
Speaker 5:  the Steam Deck happen to begin with. Then other field people are saying,

574
00:35:52,005 --> 00:35:55,765
Speaker 5:  well yeah, but they take 30% off of all of these games in Steam

575
00:35:55,865 --> 00:35:59,405
Speaker 5:  and they make ridiculous amounts of money. And I don't know.

576
00:35:59,805 --> 00:36:03,485
Speaker 5:  What I'll say there though is I don't know if they would just say yes

577
00:36:03,485 --> 00:36:07,405
Speaker 5:  because to anybody else wanting to do it for them because they like that

578
00:36:07,405 --> 00:36:08,045
Speaker 5:  amount of control.

579
00:36:08,545 --> 00:36:12,445
Speaker 1:  That's fair. So, but it does seem like we're, we're due for a race. If you

580
00:36:12,445 --> 00:36:15,725
Speaker 1:  believe this market is going to get much, much bigger in the coming years,

581
00:36:15,725 --> 00:36:19,685
Speaker 1:  and I think you and I both do, and I think if we're wrong it's because

582
00:36:19,685 --> 00:36:22,605
Speaker 1:  people are stupid, not because this isn't a good idea. So I just, I'm gonna

583
00:36:22,605 --> 00:36:26,525
Speaker 1:  plant that flag now. Like handheld gaming is, is the future we should

584
00:36:26,525 --> 00:36:30,405
Speaker 1:  have. I, I fervently believe that. But anyway, if that is

585
00:36:30,465 --> 00:36:34,445
Speaker 1:  the case, if, if the 6 million you talk about is gonna turn

586
00:36:34,445 --> 00:36:38,205
Speaker 1:  into 60 or a hundred in the next however many years,

587
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:42,565
Speaker 1:  it seems to me that the race is essentially can valve

588
00:36:43,525 --> 00:36:47,045
Speaker 1:  convince the world that the Steam Deck is good before

589
00:36:47,445 --> 00:36:51,335
Speaker 1:  somebody else can build a really good Windows

590
00:36:51,915 --> 00:36:55,765
Speaker 1:  or Xbox handheld? Is that the

591
00:36:55,765 --> 00:36:57,245
Speaker 1:  race? Is that where we are right now?

592
00:36:57,885 --> 00:37:01,445
Speaker 5:  I think that valve would be fine

593
00:37:02,145 --> 00:37:05,965
Speaker 5:  if they didn't win that race. And I, I, I don't know, I

594
00:37:05,965 --> 00:37:06,485
Speaker 5:  don't, I don't

595
00:37:06,485 --> 00:37:08,645
Speaker 1:  Know why that frustrates me, but that frustrates me. It does. It

596
00:37:08,765 --> 00:37:12,365
Speaker 5:  Frustrates me too. It frustrates me too. Like I want everyone to

597
00:37:12,365 --> 00:37:15,725
Speaker 5:  experience the glory of peace of gaming and the glory of handheld gaming.

598
00:37:16,165 --> 00:37:19,685
Speaker 5:  I want those two things for everybody and I want them to be intertwined,

599
00:37:20,385 --> 00:37:21,945
Speaker 5:  but, but

600
00:37:23,685 --> 00:37:27,595
Speaker 5:  Valve, I feel like they think about a lot of these projects

601
00:37:28,015 --> 00:37:31,675
Speaker 5:  as we, we want to

602
00:37:31,775 --> 00:37:35,555
Speaker 5:  uplift our people, our PC

603
00:37:35,555 --> 00:37:39,355
Speaker 5:  gamers. Here is another thing that would make that we want for ourselves,

604
00:37:39,355 --> 00:37:43,235
Speaker 5:  that we want our PC gamers to enjoy. And now that they

605
00:37:43,385 --> 00:37:47,355
Speaker 5:  have that, you know, guests, ve has said there's gonna be

606
00:37:47,755 --> 00:37:50,995
Speaker 5:  a Steam Deck two someday and a Steam Deck three someday and so on. They,

607
00:37:50,995 --> 00:37:54,355
Speaker 5:  they, they're planning this as a generational thing with maybe up to four

608
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,155
Speaker 5:  of them that they were willing to be like, yeah, we think we're gonna do

609
00:37:57,155 --> 00:37:57,315
Speaker 5:  that.

610
00:37:58,975 --> 00:38:01,835
Speaker 5:  But, but I don't know if they feel like they need to

611
00:38:02,775 --> 00:38:06,435
Speaker 5:  go much further, as long as somebody is letting

612
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:10,275
Speaker 5:  people do this. And so yeah, I I

613
00:38:10,595 --> 00:38:13,795
Speaker 5:  I think they will keep doing it, but I think they might be fine if the sales

614
00:38:13,935 --> 00:38:17,835
Speaker 5:  are just enough to, you know, recoup what they put into

615
00:38:17,835 --> 00:38:21,795
Speaker 5:  it when they combine the, the handheld and the game. But yes, as, as a watcher,

616
00:38:21,995 --> 00:38:23,355
Speaker 5:  somebody wants this stuff to happen, yes, please

617
00:38:25,505 --> 00:38:29,315
Speaker 5:  find the chip and the screen that'll make it happen. I wrote another story.

618
00:38:29,355 --> 00:38:33,115
Speaker 5:  I wrote a story what handheld PC makers should do

619
00:38:33,135 --> 00:38:36,365
Speaker 5:  to fight the Switch too. And I wrote it 'cause there was a lot of interest

620
00:38:36,365 --> 00:38:40,285
Speaker 5:  in the Nintendo Switch at that moment, but I do believe that there was

621
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:44,125
Speaker 5:  this moment for me where I was buying all my

622
00:38:44,535 --> 00:38:48,245
Speaker 5:  India games on Nintendo Switch. I was like, I want

623
00:38:48,825 --> 00:38:52,405
Speaker 5:  my Mario, my Zelda obviously, but I also wanna take all these other

624
00:38:52,405 --> 00:38:56,325
Speaker 5:  beautiful games. I would otherwise not have the time to play with me on the

625
00:38:56,325 --> 00:39:00,005
Speaker 5:  go to the bed, to the couch, et cetera

626
00:39:00,135 --> 00:39:04,125
Speaker 5:  where I can find the time to play them. And

627
00:39:04,165 --> 00:39:07,125
Speaker 5:  I was doing that for Switch and as soon as Steam Deck came out, I was like,

628
00:39:07,165 --> 00:39:10,025
Speaker 5:  I can do them there better, cheaper,

629
00:39:10,885 --> 00:39:14,745
Speaker 5:  longer without typing my password into Nintendo

630
00:39:14,745 --> 00:39:15,385
Speaker 5:  store every time

631
00:39:17,045 --> 00:39:20,905
Speaker 5:  and, and dealing with the Nintendo things arou around that.

632
00:39:21,565 --> 00:39:24,585
Speaker 5:  And now I was buying all my indie games on Steam Deck

633
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:28,665
Speaker 5:  and maybe there's this moment now where the switch to

634
00:39:29,755 --> 00:39:33,705
Speaker 5:  could be that next platform where people do that. If

635
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:37,505
Speaker 5:  Nintendo decides it's wants to be the place where all these indie games

636
00:39:37,505 --> 00:39:40,225
Speaker 5:  live and if it just massively overhauls its store,

637
00:39:41,325 --> 00:39:45,225
Speaker 5:  it has attracted the same kinds of games as the Steam

638
00:39:45,255 --> 00:39:49,025
Speaker 5:  Deck and it has Nintendo behind it and it's going to have so, so

639
00:39:49,305 --> 00:39:53,105
Speaker 5:  very many more sales than any of the handheld gaming

640
00:39:53,405 --> 00:39:57,345
Speaker 5:  PCs right. For a very long time to come if, if

641
00:39:57,665 --> 00:40:01,025
Speaker 5:  previous switch sales are any indication, if they don't screw it up royally

642
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:04,705
Speaker 5:  and make it a flop like the Weu, which by the way, the Weu has also sold

643
00:40:04,705 --> 00:40:08,665
Speaker 5:  more than all these handheld gaming PCs. Neither here nor there, but people

644
00:40:08,665 --> 00:40:11,705
Speaker 5:  love to bring that up when they're talking about my earlier story Fair. So,

645
00:40:11,885 --> 00:40:15,745
Speaker 5:  so I I give this advice like if you want to build

646
00:40:16,405 --> 00:40:20,105
Speaker 5:  the system that's going to beat the Steam Deck and to, that's going to meaningfully

647
00:40:20,105 --> 00:40:23,865
Speaker 5:  compete against the switch to, it's gotta have a

648
00:40:23,865 --> 00:40:27,625
Speaker 5:  true handheld operating system, not just a fresh coat of paint on windows.

649
00:40:27,965 --> 00:40:31,745
Speaker 5:  Yep. But it's also gotta, it's, it's, it's gotta have a great screen.

650
00:40:31,815 --> 00:40:34,785
Speaker 5:  It's gotta have a screen that doesn't suck up too much battery life. That

651
00:40:34,785 --> 00:40:38,105
Speaker 5:  doesn't suck up too much processing power, but it also has to have a chip.

652
00:40:39,095 --> 00:40:41,635
Speaker 5:  It has to have a chip that is more efficient

653
00:40:42,855 --> 00:40:46,705
Speaker 5:  than anything else that we've seen on the market. Save the Steam

654
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:50,465
Speaker 5:  Deck and it needs to be more powerful than the Steam Deck chip to get us

655
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:53,785
Speaker 5:  anywhere further. And that's what Valve keeps saying, it's waiting for

656
00:40:54,465 --> 00:40:57,625
Speaker 5:  interesting because that chip doesn't exist yet. Or if it exists, you know,

657
00:40:57,905 --> 00:41:01,705
Speaker 5:  nobody's been able to talk about it publicly yet the chip makers,

658
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:07,185
Speaker 5:  they build chips for the big slice of the

659
00:41:07,185 --> 00:41:10,385
Speaker 5:  market. They build them for the laptops, they build a few of them for the

660
00:41:10,415 --> 00:41:13,785
Speaker 5:  tablets like the Surface Pro. They don't build chips

661
00:41:14,215 --> 00:41:17,905
Speaker 5:  that are designed to go in anything much smaller than a laptop

662
00:41:18,165 --> 00:41:21,945
Speaker 5:  unless they get some custom or semi-custom orders for that.

663
00:41:22,925 --> 00:41:26,305
Speaker 5:  And so when Sony's building a new PlayStation, when

664
00:41:26,705 --> 00:41:30,545
Speaker 5:  Microsoft's building a new Xbox, they order semi-custom chips.

665
00:41:30,545 --> 00:41:34,005
Speaker 5:  They say, I want this chunk of a MD graphics and I want that chunk of

666
00:41:34,045 --> 00:41:37,525
Speaker 5:  A-M-D-C-P-U pair those things together, give me some custom

667
00:41:37,525 --> 00:41:39,365
Speaker 5:  interconnect, gimme some custom logic,

668
00:41:41,155 --> 00:41:45,005
Speaker 5:  bake this as small as you can in terms of nanometers on a wafer so that we

669
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:48,925
Speaker 5:  can get good yields out of that. And that's what I'm gonna order for my future

670
00:41:49,195 --> 00:41:50,085
Speaker 5:  console. Right.

671
00:41:50,105 --> 00:41:51,645
Speaker 1:  And give me 30 million of them.

672
00:41:51,915 --> 00:41:53,685
Speaker 5:  Exactly. Yeah. Gimme, gimme a lot of

673
00:41:55,205 --> 00:41:58,995
Speaker 5:  valve did the same for the Steam Deck, but

674
00:41:58,995 --> 00:42:02,235
Speaker 5:  none of these other handheld gaming PCs have that

675
00:42:02,805 --> 00:42:06,635
Speaker 5:  style of customer semi-custom chip. They've got a laptop chip, which

676
00:42:06,835 --> 00:42:10,475
Speaker 5:  a MD did some extra work to change the power

677
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:14,395
Speaker 5:  profile, make it a little bit more efficient because they know

678
00:42:14,395 --> 00:42:17,435
Speaker 5:  they're, we're not gonna be throwing as many watts at it in a handheld form

679
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:20,675
Speaker 5:  factor. But fundamentally they do not have the

680
00:42:20,765 --> 00:42:24,275
Speaker 5:  efficiency that you need to build something

681
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:28,155
Speaker 5:  that scales down to low wattage long

682
00:42:28,395 --> 00:42:32,235
Speaker 5:  battery life like the Steam Deck. Instead, windows manufacturers have to

683
00:42:32,235 --> 00:42:35,995
Speaker 5:  brute force it by putting in twice the size of battery like Asy did with

684
00:42:35,995 --> 00:42:39,715
Speaker 5:  the ROG Ally X. Right. Great system because they did that. But

685
00:42:39,715 --> 00:42:43,675
Speaker 5:  imagine if it had more efficient chip valve keeps coming

686
00:42:43,695 --> 00:42:47,435
Speaker 5:  out and saying one of their, one of their developers in particular, one of

687
00:42:47,435 --> 00:42:51,315
Speaker 5:  the Steam Deck designers, Pierre Lou gr I hope I got his name right,

688
00:42:51,325 --> 00:42:55,235
Speaker 5:  sorry if I butchered it just now. He keeps having

689
00:42:55,255 --> 00:42:59,075
Speaker 5:  to shoot down every new rumor, oh, valve's gonna use this new

690
00:42:59,075 --> 00:43:02,595
Speaker 5:  chip in their new thing. He came out and said, we are not putting the Z two

691
00:43:02,595 --> 00:43:06,395
Speaker 5:  in a Steam Deck. And until I reviewed the Lenovo Legion go

692
00:43:06,595 --> 00:43:09,995
Speaker 5:  s which has the Z two in it, I did not know why. And then I reviewed it,

693
00:43:10,095 --> 00:43:13,465
Speaker 5:  I'm like, this steam dig is beating

694
00:43:14,215 --> 00:43:17,225
Speaker 5:  this new a MD chip. How is that possible? That's

695
00:43:17,225 --> 00:43:21,025
Speaker 1:  A, that's a tough comparison. Yeah. So maybe what we're actually waiting

696
00:43:21,045 --> 00:43:24,785
Speaker 1:  for, rather than a bunch of belief in this new industry is just

697
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:29,025
Speaker 1:  somebody to build the chip and, and like floodgates will open

698
00:43:29,495 --> 00:43:32,465
Speaker 1:  when suddenly this thing is possible because that trade off you're describing

699
00:43:32,645 --> 00:43:35,745
Speaker 1:  is what everybody wants, right? Like that that is the thing that unlocks

700
00:43:35,745 --> 00:43:39,385
Speaker 1:  this and, and maybe that is the thing that we're waiting for more than anything

701
00:43:39,385 --> 00:43:40,105
Speaker 1:  else who

702
00:43:40,255 --> 00:43:44,225
Speaker 5:  Pays for the chip is the question, right? Is It, is it Qualcomm

703
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:48,145
Speaker 5:  that wants to get into the gaming space, started toying

704
00:43:48,145 --> 00:43:51,865
Speaker 5:  with it with the copilot plus PC chips, but didn't really get there

705
00:43:52,405 --> 00:43:56,385
Speaker 5:  and then suddenly Qualcomm, who's a giant player in modems

706
00:43:56,385 --> 00:43:59,745
Speaker 5:  and is beginning to be a small player in laptops, becomes the handheld PC

707
00:43:59,745 --> 00:44:03,705
Speaker 5:  gaming chip and this stuff has to move to ARM because Qualcomm makes

708
00:44:04,085 --> 00:44:08,065
Speaker 5:  arm chips and all of a sudden you're, you're running steam on arm and running

709
00:44:08,065 --> 00:44:11,905
Speaker 5:  Windows games on arm, which people have experimentally done and it

710
00:44:11,905 --> 00:44:15,385
Speaker 5:  kind of works. And there was even some code in the valve code base

711
00:44:15,385 --> 00:44:19,105
Speaker 5:  suggesting that the valve has maybe experimented with this too. Or

712
00:44:19,805 --> 00:44:23,505
Speaker 5:  is It, is it Microsoft building something

713
00:44:23,505 --> 00:44:27,185
Speaker 5:  special is Nvidia, Nvidia is the one who, by the way, Nvidia

714
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:29,825
Speaker 5:  is the one that builds the chip in the Nintendo Switch

715
00:44:30,945 --> 00:44:34,685
Speaker 5:  Nvidia, it sets Nvidia graphics in there. That's Nvidia, even CPUI believe

716
00:44:35,505 --> 00:44:39,405
Speaker 5:  Nvidia does Nvidia say, well we've, we've already got

717
00:44:39,555 --> 00:44:42,925
Speaker 5:  this chunk of the handheld gaming market, why don't we have all the handheld

718
00:44:42,925 --> 00:44:46,605
Speaker 5:  gaming market? And again, things move to arm and we're running Windows

719
00:44:46,655 --> 00:44:50,445
Speaker 5:  games on arm and and so on and so forth. Is it a bunch

720
00:44:50,585 --> 00:44:54,405
Speaker 5:  of these PC makers banding

721
00:44:54,405 --> 00:44:56,765
Speaker 5:  forces and saying a MD

722
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,845
Speaker 5:  instead of giving us a laptop chip this year, how about we all foot the bill

723
00:45:01,945 --> 00:45:05,885
Speaker 5:  for something better for handheld gaming PCs and then we're, we're all on

724
00:45:05,885 --> 00:45:09,525
Speaker 5:  the same footing as one another, but we were there anyway and now we think

725
00:45:09,525 --> 00:45:13,245
Speaker 5:  we can sell a lot more than, well if you look at 2 million

726
00:45:13,415 --> 00:45:17,005
Speaker 5:  cumulative sales for handheld, for Windows based handheld GIM

727
00:45:17,265 --> 00:45:21,205
Speaker 5:  PCs over the past, you know, two years, maybe they can't afford to

728
00:45:21,205 --> 00:45:24,165
Speaker 5:  do that quite yet. Maybe it'll be longer before that happens.

729
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:28,205
Speaker 1:  Yeah, somebody's either gonna have to go all in or

730
00:45:28,755 --> 00:45:32,725
Speaker 1:  something is going to have to happen externally that winds

731
00:45:32,725 --> 00:45:35,765
Speaker 1:  back. It seems like I have to say this is all really validating my theory

732
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:39,765
Speaker 1:  that I made the right call by just buying into the switch and never unplugging

733
00:45:39,765 --> 00:45:42,245
Speaker 1:  it and it's gonna be fine for a while. This is all making me feel better

734
00:45:42,245 --> 00:45:43,685
Speaker 1:  about that decision. Ah,

735
00:45:43,685 --> 00:45:43,965
Speaker 5:  David.

736
00:45:44,465 --> 00:45:47,645
Speaker 1:  All right Sean, we gotta take a break, but thank you for coming on as always.

737
00:45:47,715 --> 00:45:48,405
Speaker 1:  It's good to see you.

738
00:45:48,825 --> 00:45:49,245
Speaker 5:  Thanks.

739
00:45:50,105 --> 00:45:52,965
Speaker 1:  All right, we gotta take a break, but then we're gonna come back and we are

740
00:45:52,965 --> 00:45:56,685
Speaker 1:  going to talk about the future of sports and why the future of

741
00:45:56,685 --> 00:46:00,205
Speaker 1:  sports is really humongous, truly

742
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:04,565
Speaker 1:  gigantic displays because of course it's, we'll be right

743
00:46:04,565 --> 00:46:04,725
Speaker 1:  back

744
00:47:04,035 --> 00:47:07,795
Speaker 1:  few weeks ago I got on a plane down to West Palm Beach, Florida to go see

745
00:47:07,835 --> 00:47:11,555
Speaker 1:  a match in a new league called TGL Golf. The golf I went to see

746
00:47:11,555 --> 00:47:15,515
Speaker 1:  wasn't on this big beautiful outdoor course though there are lots of those

747
00:47:15,575 --> 00:47:19,435
Speaker 1:  in West Palm Beach. I was indoors, I was in this small arena

748
00:47:19,435 --> 00:47:22,955
Speaker 1:  called the SoFi Arena that had only been open for a few weeks.

749
00:47:23,425 --> 00:47:26,955
Speaker 1:  I'll explain how the game works in a minute, but first let me just walk you

750
00:47:26,955 --> 00:47:30,805
Speaker 1:  through the arena outside. It's just a big white box with a

751
00:47:30,805 --> 00:47:34,725
Speaker 1:  giant SoFi logo on it. It honestly looks more like a data center than

752
00:47:34,725 --> 00:47:38,165
Speaker 1:  a sports arena. When you kind of get there, you walk in the door and there's

753
00:47:38,165 --> 00:47:42,125
Speaker 1:  a TV set for filming pre-game shows. There's a merch store and there's

754
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:44,965
Speaker 1:  really not that much else. This whole thing, honestly, to stand there feels

755
00:47:45,145 --> 00:47:48,965
Speaker 1:  barely finished. It has a bunch of high top tables and

756
00:47:49,045 --> 00:47:52,845
Speaker 1:  a few bar carts that all just kind of appeared on the polished

757
00:47:53,045 --> 00:47:56,925
Speaker 1:  concrete and that's it. There's a walkway that goes all the way around the

758
00:47:56,925 --> 00:48:00,605
Speaker 1:  edge of the building and it's all kind of like this, but there's another

759
00:48:00,765 --> 00:48:03,725
Speaker 1:  structure inside of the building and this is where all of the good stuff

760
00:48:03,725 --> 00:48:07,525
Speaker 1:  happens. It's like a mix of a movie set and a sports arena.

761
00:48:08,065 --> 00:48:11,285
Speaker 1:  So just picture this with me, if I'm standing in the middle of the arena,

762
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:15,405
Speaker 1:  I'm on a flat patch of turf in the middle of a space that feels

763
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:19,605
Speaker 1:  maybe a little larger than a football field. On one side of me

764
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:23,485
Speaker 1:  there's a round area which has a couple of sand filled bunkers and a

765
00:48:23,575 --> 00:48:26,885
Speaker 1:  small hill and a bunch of different golf holes around it.

766
00:48:27,185 --> 00:48:30,805
Speaker 1:  That's the green, that's the spot where every single TGL hole

767
00:48:30,955 --> 00:48:34,765
Speaker 1:  ends. It's 41 yards across and the whole thing sits on a

768
00:48:34,765 --> 00:48:38,605
Speaker 1:  turntable so it can rotate up to 180 degrees. There are

769
00:48:38,605 --> 00:48:42,565
Speaker 1:  hundreds of tiny actuators underneath the green that can change its shape

770
00:48:42,825 --> 00:48:46,765
Speaker 1:  and its slope in just a few seconds too. It's one green, but

771
00:48:46,765 --> 00:48:50,325
Speaker 1:  it can be almost anything. That is where all TGL golf holes

772
00:48:50,545 --> 00:48:54,445
Speaker 1:  end. They begin on my other side where players stand on a patch

773
00:48:54,445 --> 00:48:58,165
Speaker 1:  of grass that's actually grown in a field outside of the arena and they hit

774
00:48:58,165 --> 00:49:02,045
Speaker 1:  balls into a giant screen. And when I say a giant screen,

775
00:49:02,405 --> 00:49:06,085
Speaker 1:  I mean a giant screen, it's 53 feet high

776
00:49:06,185 --> 00:49:09,605
Speaker 1:  and 64 feet across and however big you think a

777
00:49:09,605 --> 00:49:13,245
Speaker 1:  thirty three hundred and ninety two square foot screen looks in person.

778
00:49:13,805 --> 00:49:17,645
Speaker 1:  I promise you it's way bigger than that. In between the screen

779
00:49:17,645 --> 00:49:21,565
Speaker 1:  and the green, there's just tech everywhere you look. So as I'm

780
00:49:21,645 --> 00:49:25,485
Speaker 1:  standing here, there's a robotic camera wheeling around, like a go-kart capturing

781
00:49:25,485 --> 00:49:29,245
Speaker 1:  video from these super low angles. There's a SkyCam overhead

782
00:49:29,265 --> 00:49:32,965
Speaker 1:  on wires like the ones you see at an NFL game filming everything from

783
00:49:33,055 --> 00:49:36,725
Speaker 1:  above. There are sensors I can see there are sensors I can't see.

784
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:40,725
Speaker 1:  There's a huge lighting grid up above. This is what I mean

785
00:49:40,725 --> 00:49:44,245
Speaker 1:  by it feeling like a movie set. There's no sense here that the

786
00:49:44,245 --> 00:49:48,165
Speaker 1:  technology is separate from the field. There's a huge sensor

787
00:49:48,215 --> 00:49:52,125
Speaker 1:  array, just a few feet behind every golfer as they swing. And that robot

788
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:56,085
Speaker 1:  camera I mentioned does this cool swoopy motion thing in front

789
00:49:56,085 --> 00:49:59,925
Speaker 1:  of them before just about every shot. It all adds up

790
00:49:59,925 --> 00:50:03,605
Speaker 1:  to something that feels like a cross between a movie

791
00:50:04,065 --> 00:50:08,045
Speaker 1:  and a video game and a sporting event. It's a little bit we golf

792
00:50:08,145 --> 00:50:12,005
Speaker 1:  and a little bit professional golf and I have to be honest with you, I kind

793
00:50:12,005 --> 00:50:15,565
Speaker 1:  of love it. Okay, this is probably the point where I should explain

794
00:50:15,785 --> 00:50:19,765
Speaker 1:  how TGL works and why it works the way that it does. The how is

795
00:50:19,765 --> 00:50:23,045
Speaker 1:  both weird and fairly straightforward, at least for our purposes

796
00:50:23,635 --> 00:50:27,365
Speaker 1:  here is how Ricky Fowler, who's a pro golfer, explains it in a YouTube

797
00:50:27,605 --> 00:50:29,325
Speaker 1:  overview that TGL made a while ago.

798
00:50:29,575 --> 00:50:33,365
Speaker 7:  There are two sessions, the first triples a nine

799
00:50:33,365 --> 00:50:36,925
Speaker 7:  hole three versus three alternate shot. The second

800
00:50:37,355 --> 00:50:41,285
Speaker 7:  singles, six holes of players going head to head. Each

801
00:50:41,285 --> 00:50:45,245
Speaker 7:  hole is worth one point if tied at the end and overtime determines the winner.

802
00:50:45,805 --> 00:50:49,605
Speaker 7:  TGL is also bringing the golf a shot clock, a ref, a timeout to ice the

803
00:50:49,605 --> 00:50:53,405
Speaker 7:  golfer, a hammer to raise the stakes. And the players are all micd up to

804
00:50:53,405 --> 00:50:54,365
Speaker 7:  get you in on the action.

805
00:50:54,855 --> 00:50:58,525
Speaker 1:  There are more rules than that and some quirks to the system, but it's ultimately

806
00:50:58,525 --> 00:51:01,845
Speaker 1:  not terribly complicated. It's just golf as a team sport. It's really fun.

807
00:51:02,165 --> 00:51:05,645
Speaker 1:  I had a good time at the match I went to, which was really competitive and

808
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:09,365
Speaker 1:  went into overtime, which was a a chip off sort of like penalty kicks in

809
00:51:09,365 --> 00:51:11,765
Speaker 1:  soccer, but they were just chipping to get close to the whole super fun.

810
00:51:12,265 --> 00:51:16,205
Speaker 1:  The vibe of the whole thing is more goofy exhibition match

811
00:51:16,355 --> 00:51:20,085
Speaker 1:  than like high level golf tournament. But it's a fun thing.

812
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:24,205
Speaker 1:  And actually the thing that surprised me the most was that most of that tech,

813
00:51:24,235 --> 00:51:28,205
Speaker 1:  including that giant turntable green works pretty seamlessly.

814
00:51:28,205 --> 00:51:31,845
Speaker 1:  You don't even really notice it as it's happening. TGL is above all

815
00:51:32,125 --> 00:51:35,565
Speaker 1:  a TV show. No one who makes It is unclear about that fact.

816
00:51:35,955 --> 00:51:39,805
Speaker 1:  It's 15 holes long instead of 18 so that a whole match can be played in two

817
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:43,725
Speaker 1:  hours of primetime television matches are early in the week so

818
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:46,685
Speaker 1:  that they don't conflict with the golfer's more important tournaments and

819
00:51:46,685 --> 00:51:50,245
Speaker 1:  they're in the early evenings to fit with the rest of ESPN schedule. Hell,

820
00:51:50,265 --> 00:51:53,205
Speaker 1:  the whole thing is in Palm Beach because that's where a lot of the golfers

821
00:51:53,205 --> 00:51:56,885
Speaker 1:  live, and so most of them can just drive to the matches. One of them,

822
00:51:57,245 --> 00:52:00,005
Speaker 1:  I won't name who because it wasn't their fault, almost hit me with their

823
00:52:00,005 --> 00:52:03,565
Speaker 1:  car in the parking lot, but that's not important. The reason the

824
00:52:03,645 --> 00:52:07,485
Speaker 1:  TGL Arena looks like a movie set is because more than anything, It is

825
00:52:07,765 --> 00:52:11,525
Speaker 1:  a movie set. This thing is a product made to be watched on ESPN.

826
00:52:12,145 --> 00:52:15,565
Speaker 1:  The TGL folks actually borrowed from lots of other sports. In making this

827
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:19,445
Speaker 1:  TV show work, all the players come in with these wrestling

828
00:52:19,445 --> 00:52:23,325
Speaker 1:  style entrances that were lit by the same person who did some of the wrestling

829
00:52:23,525 --> 00:52:23,845
Speaker 1:  entrances,

830
00:52:24,345 --> 00:52:28,045
Speaker 8:  The 2020 PGA champion and 2021

831
00:52:28,115 --> 00:52:31,885
Speaker 8:  Open champion, a two time member of the Ryder Cup

832
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:35,765
Speaker 8:  and Presidents Cup teams makes some noise for Colin

833
00:52:40,125 --> 00:52:43,465
Speaker 1:  During the match. The players are micd up, so you get lots of the banter

834
00:52:43,465 --> 00:52:46,865
Speaker 1:  you might hear from players in a football or a basketball game. And honestly,

835
00:52:46,865 --> 00:52:49,145
Speaker 1:  hearing golf pros trash talk is pretty fun.

836
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:52,065
Speaker 7:  I played with 'em all day Saturday. I heavily didn't hit one shot like that.

837
00:52:53,165 --> 00:52:56,945
Speaker 1:  The overhead sky cam is also borrowed from the NFL and it adds some really

838
00:52:56,945 --> 00:53:00,785
Speaker 1:  cool stuff to golf. In a normal tournament, you'd never get to see a

839
00:53:00,785 --> 00:53:04,465
Speaker 1:  shot from directly overhead, and I've been seeing golf lovers all over

840
00:53:04,465 --> 00:53:08,225
Speaker 1:  really geek out over getting new views of pros form and swing

841
00:53:08,225 --> 00:53:12,025
Speaker 1:  because it's right over top of their head. The reality is all of this

842
00:53:12,025 --> 00:53:15,625
Speaker 1:  adds up to something way more interesting on television than in person.

843
00:53:16,255 --> 00:53:19,665
Speaker 1:  When I went, it was late January and it was the fourth ever match in the

844
00:53:19,665 --> 00:53:22,865
Speaker 1:  history of TGL. The match I went to was actually a big one. It was Tiger

845
00:53:22,865 --> 00:53:26,805
Speaker 1:  Woods and Rory McElroy who are two of golf's biggest names and two

846
00:53:26,805 --> 00:53:30,245
Speaker 1:  of the best players of this century and two of the investors who actually

847
00:53:30,275 --> 00:53:34,205
Speaker 1:  made TGL happen and they were facing off against each other, or at least

848
00:53:34,205 --> 00:53:38,165
Speaker 1:  their teams were Noah Kahn and Nile Horen were hanging out in the team box

849
00:53:38,165 --> 00:53:40,685
Speaker 1:  right across from my seat. They seemed like they were friends. I don't know

850
00:53:41,285 --> 00:53:44,405
Speaker 1:  the baseball players, David Ortiz and Mike Trout were in the house. It was

851
00:53:44,405 --> 00:53:47,805
Speaker 1:  a whole thing, you know, it was a big celebrity evening in West Palm Beach.

852
00:53:48,705 --> 00:53:52,565
Speaker 1:  The TGL folks are pretty much all either golf people or TV people

853
00:53:52,625 --> 00:53:56,405
Speaker 1:  or both, and they're still clearly learning how to make great

854
00:53:56,495 --> 00:54:00,285
Speaker 1:  arena sports. They had only just hired folks to come and

855
00:54:00,285 --> 00:54:04,245
Speaker 1:  like fire T-shirts into the crowd to get people psyched, but there were

856
00:54:04,245 --> 00:54:07,445
Speaker 1:  still a bunch of commercial breaks where all of us in the audience just kind

857
00:54:07,445 --> 00:54:11,285
Speaker 1:  of sat and waited for things to start up again. You never notice how long

858
00:54:11,365 --> 00:54:15,245
Speaker 1:  a commercial break is until you're just sitting there quietly waiting for

859
00:54:15,245 --> 00:54:19,205
Speaker 1:  sports to start. At one point, the in arena announcer alerted us that

860
00:54:19,205 --> 00:54:22,965
Speaker 1:  we were coming back like we were like a sitcom crowd supposed to cheer as

861
00:54:22,965 --> 00:54:26,485
Speaker 1:  we came back from commercial. There wasn't a big applaud now sign,

862
00:54:26,865 --> 00:54:30,485
Speaker 1:  but it honestly felt like that might be coming. I knew all of that would

863
00:54:30,485 --> 00:54:33,565
Speaker 1:  be the case though. They're pretty straightforward. Once again that this

864
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:37,285
Speaker 1:  is a TV product first and foremost. Even Tiger Woods would tell you that

865
00:54:38,125 --> 00:54:41,765
Speaker 1:  I really went to West Palm Beach to find out one thing and one thing only,

866
00:54:42,055 --> 00:54:45,565
Speaker 1:  which is the big question that I and a lot of other people have been wondering

867
00:54:45,565 --> 00:54:48,725
Speaker 1:  since we first heard about TGL. Is this

868
00:54:49,315 --> 00:54:53,125
Speaker 1:  golf? Can you replace a golf course with a screen and a

869
00:54:53,125 --> 00:54:57,095
Speaker 1:  turntable and still call it the same sport? We actually started getting

870
00:54:57,095 --> 00:55:00,935
Speaker 1:  answers to this question pretty quickly. In one of the very first

871
00:55:00,935 --> 00:55:04,295
Speaker 1:  matches of the season, tiger Woods may the greatest golfer of all time

872
00:55:04,565 --> 00:55:08,415
Speaker 1:  stepped up and hit a shot from about a hundred yards out and just

873
00:55:08,975 --> 00:55:12,615
Speaker 1:  absolutely drilled it into the water. He hit it way, way,

874
00:55:13,195 --> 00:55:14,175
Speaker 1:  way too long

875
00:55:21,135 --> 00:55:23,815
Speaker 9:  I think. I think that up box goes too far.

876
00:55:25,095 --> 00:55:26,455
Speaker 9:  I think the up box goes miles.

877
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:30,295
Speaker 1:  He hits the ball into the screen and the screen shows the ball bouncing off

878
00:55:30,295 --> 00:55:33,975
Speaker 1:  of the green and into the water. And the water by the way, is kind of shoddily

879
00:55:34,055 --> 00:55:37,255
Speaker 1:  rendered because I don't think anyone thought we'd need to look at the water

880
00:55:37,325 --> 00:55:41,055
Speaker 1:  very much. And Tiger just sort of stares down like

881
00:55:41,085 --> 00:55:44,975
Speaker 1:  he's confused that this just happened. Golfers this good can usually

882
00:55:45,125 --> 00:55:48,975
Speaker 1:  tell how a shot went the second they're finished swinging and you could

883
00:55:48,975 --> 00:55:52,665
Speaker 1:  tell this ball didn't do what he expected. A little while later,

884
00:55:52,715 --> 00:55:56,545
Speaker 1:  tiger hit another short shot like this one and hit it way left.

885
00:55:57,085 --> 00:56:01,025
Speaker 1:  He didn't like that shot very much either. He threw something I think a t

886
00:56:01,085 --> 00:56:04,505
Speaker 1:  at the tracking sensor behind him as he walked away and since he had his

887
00:56:04,505 --> 00:56:06,625
Speaker 1:  mic on, it was pretty clear how he felt

888
00:56:07,135 --> 00:56:09,145
Speaker 9:  That easy. That sucked. Thank you. So,

889
00:56:09,645 --> 00:56:13,305
Speaker 1:  And then not long After that, tiger hit it into the water again

890
00:56:14,085 --> 00:56:17,505
Speaker 1:  and this time all he did was look at the screen and laugh.

891
00:56:19,015 --> 00:56:20,745
Speaker 9:  Hang on. How many penalties have we had?

892
00:56:22,135 --> 00:56:25,765
Speaker 1:  Tiger's team, which is called the Jupiter Links golf club, got absolutely

893
00:56:25,775 --> 00:56:29,365
Speaker 1:  demolished in that match. Tiger chalked the whole thing up to him, just not

894
00:56:29,365 --> 00:56:33,285
Speaker 1:  playing well. But a lot of people started asking, is the technology here

895
00:56:33,605 --> 00:56:36,885
Speaker 1:  actually working? We've all seen what Tiger Woods can do with a golf club.

896
00:56:37,305 --> 00:56:41,205
Speaker 1:  So when it goes wrong, are we gonna blame him or

897
00:56:41,205 --> 00:56:44,965
Speaker 1:  are we gonna blame the technology? There's the saying in sports

898
00:56:44,995 --> 00:56:48,765
Speaker 1:  that ball don't lie. The idea is that whenever something happens that

899
00:56:48,815 --> 00:56:52,725
Speaker 1:  feels wrong, the game itself kind of auto corrects

900
00:56:52,915 --> 00:56:56,605
Speaker 1:  it's karma basically. But for sports, there was this NBA player, his name

901
00:56:56,605 --> 00:57:00,325
Speaker 1:  was Rashid Wallace, who would famously yell ball don't lie when

902
00:57:00,525 --> 00:57:04,365
Speaker 1:  he'd get called for a foul, but then the player who he didn't think he fouled

903
00:57:04,365 --> 00:57:07,805
Speaker 1:  would miss the free throw. I think Rasheed Wallace might've invented the

904
00:57:07,805 --> 00:57:11,525
Speaker 1:  saying, I'm honestly not sure, but the message is simple. The game

905
00:57:11,655 --> 00:57:15,565
Speaker 1:  tells the truth and the ball keeps the score. On a

906
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:18,525
Speaker 1:  real golf course, we'd know what happened. If Teer Woods is shot, went into

907
00:57:18,525 --> 00:57:21,965
Speaker 1:  the water, it would mean that Tiger hit a bad shot ball, don't lie.

908
00:57:22,785 --> 00:57:26,645
Speaker 1:  But in this case, we didn't see where Tiger's shot went. We

909
00:57:26,645 --> 00:57:30,525
Speaker 1:  saw the beginning of the shot and then it hit a huge giant screen and then

910
00:57:30,565 --> 00:57:33,925
Speaker 1:  a half second later we saw an animated ball fly through the air, bounce off

911
00:57:33,925 --> 00:57:34,885
Speaker 1:  the green and hit the water.

912
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:40,485
Speaker 1:  There is an awful lot that happens in that half second that is

913
00:57:40,725 --> 00:57:43,725
Speaker 1:  designed to make sure that the virtual ball still don't lie.

914
00:57:44,385 --> 00:57:48,285
Speaker 10:  So there's the, this pole here that's got two cameras we go

915
00:57:48,285 --> 00:57:52,125
Speaker 10:  further up little green light from the back. Oh yeah, there and the same

916
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:53,325
Speaker 10:  on the opposite side. So it's,

917
00:57:53,435 --> 00:57:57,245
Speaker 1:  That is Andrew McCauley, he's the CTO at a company called Tomorrow Sports

918
00:57:57,505 --> 00:58:01,085
Speaker 1:  and the Technical Mastermind behind all of TGL from the

919
00:58:01,195 --> 00:58:04,645
Speaker 1:  turntable to the screen, to the sensors, to the cabling. That puts it all

920
00:58:04,805 --> 00:58:08,405
Speaker 1:  together. That's all Andrew. And right now, as he and I are talking, he's

921
00:58:08,565 --> 00:58:11,885
Speaker 1:  standing on the middle of the TGL Arena turf, right behind the T box

922
00:58:12,205 --> 00:58:15,365
Speaker 1:  pointing to a bunch of different stuff and explaining to me how it all works.

923
00:58:16,155 --> 00:58:20,085
Speaker 1:  Each of those poles with two cameras that he mentioned is a full system from

924
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:23,565
Speaker 1:  a company called Top Tracer, which tracks a golf ball through the air

925
00:58:24,065 --> 00:58:27,325
Speaker 1:  top. Tracer is everywhere in golf. If you go to a driving range, there's

926
00:58:27,325 --> 00:58:30,685
Speaker 1:  a decent chance you're using top tracer tech just to see how far your shots

927
00:58:30,705 --> 00:58:34,485
Speaker 1:  go. This is the same idea, just way more complicated. There's

928
00:58:34,485 --> 00:58:38,205
Speaker 10:  A redundancy and an accuracy play to this from a redundancy

929
00:58:38,205 --> 00:58:42,045
Speaker 10:  standpoint, we could lose three systems, we could be down

930
00:58:42,045 --> 00:58:45,965
Speaker 10:  to just one pair left. Sure still get an accurate trace

931
00:58:47,075 --> 00:58:48,085
Speaker 10:  with all four running,

932
00:58:50,195 --> 00:58:53,845
Speaker 10:  they do, this is where, where it differs a little bit from the range. They,

933
00:58:53,955 --> 00:58:57,925
Speaker 10:  they stitch together the results from as many as

934
00:58:57,925 --> 00:59:01,165
Speaker 10:  it gets. Okay, so all four is it and chooses,

935
00:59:01,315 --> 00:59:05,285
Speaker 11:  Does it like improve linearly that way? Like is having four things pointing

936
00:59:05,285 --> 00:59:07,845
Speaker 11:  at it gonna give you better data than having one or two or three?

937
00:59:07,955 --> 00:59:11,245
Speaker 10:  That won't be linear because it, there's probably, there's a, there's a

938
00:59:11,245 --> 00:59:14,285
Speaker 10:  point where it's not gonna, it's gonna matter. Okay, but, but

939
00:59:14,285 --> 00:59:15,965
Speaker 11:  It helps more, more than one helps. Okay. But

940
00:59:15,965 --> 00:59:16,125
Speaker 1:  It helps.

941
00:59:16,155 --> 00:59:16,445
Speaker 10:  Okay.

942
00:59:16,985 --> 00:59:20,165
Speaker 1:  In addition to the top tracer cameras, which are capturing the flight of

943
00:59:20,165 --> 00:59:23,885
Speaker 1:  the ball in stereoscopic 3D, there's another sensor array

944
00:59:23,885 --> 00:59:27,605
Speaker 1:  right behind the tee box, lower down on the ground. This is called a launch

945
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:29,885
Speaker 1:  monitor and it's made by a company called Full Swing.

946
00:59:30,265 --> 00:59:33,965
Speaker 10:  One thing that top tracer doesn't do is give us that anything from moment

947
00:59:33,985 --> 00:59:37,085
Speaker 10:  of impact, right? It's just looking at the ball. If you go fly from the

948
00:59:37,085 --> 00:59:40,685
Speaker 10:  rough, the ball behaves that way and it models it that way, right? If you

949
00:59:40,685 --> 00:59:44,365
Speaker 10:  don't, it doesn't. So, but we added false false

950
00:59:44,365 --> 00:59:47,565
Speaker 10:  swings, obviously the sim, the big simulator game software

951
00:59:48,175 --> 00:59:52,125
Speaker 10:  customized for us and we added there an array

952
00:59:52,265 --> 00:59:56,205
Speaker 10:  of their launch monitors so that we could also

953
00:59:56,265 --> 01:00:00,165
Speaker 10:  get moment of impact information that gives us

954
01:00:00,165 --> 01:00:03,325
Speaker 10:  stuff with Club Trace that doesn't like club speed and things and things

955
01:00:03,325 --> 01:00:07,285
Speaker 10:  like that. Anything to do with the club, it gives us a second spin number

956
01:00:07,345 --> 01:00:07,685
Speaker 10:  as well.

957
01:00:08,405 --> 01:00:11,685
Speaker 1:  I called up Andrew later after this conversation and asked him to explain

958
01:00:11,685 --> 01:00:15,005
Speaker 1:  to me again how all of this stuff gets combined to figure out what happens

959
01:00:15,105 --> 01:00:19,045
Speaker 1:  to the ball. Basically what he said is it starts as soon as a player walks

960
01:00:19,045 --> 01:00:22,805
Speaker 1:  up to the box to hit their shot, the screen switches to show that their

961
01:00:22,835 --> 01:00:26,125
Speaker 1:  spot on the course pointing at the hole and everything resets.

962
01:00:26,765 --> 01:00:29,855
Speaker 12:  Yeah. So we've activated the system to be watching, right? And then as soon

963
01:00:29,855 --> 01:00:33,695
Speaker 12:  as the ball is hit and starts flying, the first thing that

964
01:00:33,695 --> 01:00:36,775
Speaker 12:  happens is the top tracer tracking system

965
01:00:37,535 --> 01:00:41,455
Speaker 12:  observes that ball flying and it's, it's 35 yards to the

966
01:00:41,455 --> 01:00:45,215
Speaker 12:  screen and it starts to

967
01:00:45,325 --> 01:00:49,135
Speaker 12:  calculate or extrapolate like where that ball

968
01:00:49,135 --> 01:00:52,895
Speaker 12:  would've continued to fly, what trajectory, speed, angles,

969
01:00:53,035 --> 01:00:56,895
Speaker 12:  et cetera, with that ball of continued to fly on if that

970
01:00:56,895 --> 01:00:59,655
Speaker 12:  screen hadn't happened to be there to stop it flying

971
01:01:00,995 --> 01:01:04,975
Speaker 12:  in parallel with that, the full swing radars that

972
01:01:04,975 --> 01:01:08,655
Speaker 12:  are behind the tee box give us moment of impact information.

973
01:01:09,195 --> 01:01:13,095
Speaker 12:  So that's where we get the club head speed from. We get some spin information

974
01:01:13,205 --> 01:01:17,175
Speaker 12:  from that top tracer also gives us spin

975
01:01:17,405 --> 01:01:21,175
Speaker 12:  with their calculations of the trajectory. So I think, as I mentioned,

976
01:01:21,395 --> 01:01:25,335
Speaker 12:  you know, when you were here, this is customized versions of

977
01:01:25,335 --> 01:01:27,815
Speaker 12:  all these people's technology and they're layered together

978
01:01:29,275 --> 01:01:33,055
Speaker 12:  to make this kind of a, you know, one, one of one tech stack

979
01:01:33,235 --> 01:01:36,495
Speaker 12:  for, for tracking golf balls accurately in a, in an indoor

980
01:01:37,385 --> 01:01:39,535
Speaker 12:  short field environment if you wanna call it that.

981
01:01:39,965 --> 01:01:43,565
Speaker 1:  Okay. So it's taking like one set of data

982
01:01:43,785 --> 01:01:47,685
Speaker 1:  is the, the impact, and that's if I'm right, that's basically what you get

983
01:01:47,685 --> 01:01:51,525
Speaker 1:  from, but like a normal simulator, right? It's all about that

984
01:01:51,525 --> 01:01:52,645
Speaker 1:  like immediate impact.

985
01:01:53,115 --> 01:01:57,045
Speaker 12:  Yeah, most certainly launch monitors simulators that are

986
01:01:57,045 --> 01:02:00,885
Speaker 12:  based on just a launch monitor sitting down by the ball and

987
01:02:00,885 --> 01:02:03,685
Speaker 12:  capturing that moment of impact and then they extrapolate what would've

988
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:07,725
Speaker 12:  happened from a relatively small amount of data. Okay, since

989
01:02:07,845 --> 01:02:11,765
Speaker 12:  we're capturing using top tracer data, we're watching the actual

990
01:02:11,765 --> 01:02:15,165
Speaker 12:  bull fly a long period of time and then extrapolating the rest of the flight.

991
01:02:15,225 --> 01:02:19,085
Speaker 12:  So that's much more like a well top tracer is, is a, is

992
01:02:19,205 --> 01:02:22,325
Speaker 12:  a range, right? It's the number one technology and range is out there tracking

993
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:25,765
Speaker 12:  balls, right? So you know, it's the best in the business in terms of, in

994
01:02:25,765 --> 01:02:28,485
Speaker 12:  terms of that, so, so we're actually tracking the flight of the ball and

995
01:02:28,485 --> 01:02:32,325
Speaker 12:  then extending it versus taking moment of

996
01:02:32,325 --> 01:02:34,805
Speaker 12:  impact information and extrapolating it from that, if that makes sense.

997
01:02:35,035 --> 01:02:35,325
Speaker 12:  Sure.

998
01:02:35,625 --> 01:02:39,565
Speaker 1:  Why 35 yards? I feel like obviously if you were just gonna

999
01:02:39,565 --> 01:02:42,085
Speaker 1:  do the entire length of a golf course, that sort of defeats the purpose,

1000
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:45,885
Speaker 1:  but like would it be better if it were 50 or

1001
01:02:45,885 --> 01:02:49,205
Speaker 1:  75 or a hundred yards of data that you could get

1002
01:02:50,435 --> 01:02:53,375
Speaker 12:  The 35 yards was, was absolutely

1003
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:58,095
Speaker 12:  based on the testing and the algorithms and the, and the

1004
01:02:58,095 --> 01:03:02,055
Speaker 12:  logic that says that's, you know, with some room

1005
01:03:02,055 --> 01:03:05,895
Speaker 12:  in there that's more than enough to get all the data you need to be

1006
01:03:06,095 --> 01:03:09,775
Speaker 12:  accurate for the rest of the shot. And then we literally

1007
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:13,215
Speaker 12:  size of the building, size of the field of play, how much real green do

1008
01:03:13,215 --> 01:03:14,935
Speaker 12:  we want map as much as we can get.

1009
01:03:15,845 --> 01:03:19,695
Speaker 1:  This is all designed for, like Andrew said, accuracy and redundancy

1010
01:03:20,195 --> 01:03:24,175
Speaker 1:  and after those messy tiger wood shots at the very beginning a lot

1011
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:27,975
Speaker 1:  of people had a lot of feelings, but TGL seemed to still be really confident

1012
01:03:27,975 --> 01:03:31,455
Speaker 1:  that its technology worked, but lots of fans weren't.

1013
01:03:31,905 --> 01:03:35,695
Speaker 1:  There were theories floating around that TGL chose to not

1014
01:03:35,835 --> 01:03:39,415
Speaker 1:  use better technology because Tiger Woods is involved with full swing

1015
01:03:39,795 --> 01:03:43,455
Speaker 1:  or that something in the physics engine of the TGL system was just fundamentally

1016
01:03:43,455 --> 01:03:47,335
Speaker 1:  broken. The thing is, and I think this is the problem, there's really

1017
01:03:47,355 --> 01:03:51,255
Speaker 1:  no way to know for sure and for an organization like TGL that

1018
01:03:51,255 --> 01:03:54,455
Speaker 1:  wants to be seen as a real honest to god sport,

1019
01:03:55,125 --> 01:03:59,015
Speaker 1:  that is a hard problem to solve. This is easy in the real world, right?

1020
01:03:59,115 --> 01:04:02,815
Speaker 1:  The ball goes where the ball goes and even in a video game,

1021
01:04:02,915 --> 01:04:06,695
Speaker 1:  at least everyone's playing by the same rules in a game that is typically

1022
01:04:06,705 --> 01:04:10,415
Speaker 1:  consistent. But when we combine the real world and the virtual

1023
01:04:10,795 --> 01:04:14,775
Speaker 1:  one and the virtual world's job is to figure out what's going on in the real

1024
01:04:14,775 --> 01:04:18,455
Speaker 1:  world and then make guesses about it, the translation gets really tricky.

1025
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,895
Speaker 1:  There've been a couple of other issues along these lines over the course

1026
01:04:21,895 --> 01:04:25,695
Speaker 1:  of the season. A few weeks After that, tiger Woods night, Tommy Fleetwood,

1027
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:29,535
Speaker 1:  another very good professional golfer stepped up and hit a really

1028
01:04:29,765 --> 01:04:30,735
Speaker 1:  confusing shot.

1029
01:04:36,485 --> 01:04:37,335
Speaker 14:  What just happened?

1030
01:04:38,485 --> 01:04:42,295
Speaker 1:  Fleetwood got up, swung the club normally hit it really well and according

1031
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:45,895
Speaker 1:  to the screen, hit it about 40 yards instead of the 167

1032
01:04:46,005 --> 01:04:49,935
Speaker 1:  that he needed. That's like a shot that I would hit on a

1033
01:04:49,995 --> 01:04:53,615
Speaker 1:  bad day on the golf course. Pros don't hit those shots and

1034
01:04:53,615 --> 01:04:56,815
Speaker 1:  Fleetwood hadn't either. This time it turns out there was actually a pretty

1035
01:04:56,815 --> 01:04:58,095
Speaker 1:  simple explanation.

1036
01:04:58,565 --> 01:05:02,295
Speaker 12:  What actually happened was that that the top trace system that I talked

1037
01:05:02,295 --> 01:05:05,695
Speaker 12:  about sitting there waiting for a golf ball to stop flying through on track,

1038
01:05:06,635 --> 01:05:10,255
Speaker 12:  it tracked the golf ball and Tommy Fleetwood hit a a, a beautiful

1039
01:05:10,305 --> 01:05:13,975
Speaker 12:  divot with that shot that flew in a beautiful

1040
01:05:14,115 --> 01:05:18,085
Speaker 12:  arc and unfortunately we tracked that as well as the golf ball and

1041
01:05:18,085 --> 01:05:21,965
Speaker 12:  the system decided that that was, that was the shot that got

1042
01:05:22,025 --> 01:05:22,245
Speaker 12:  hit.

1043
01:05:22,765 --> 01:05:26,375
Speaker 1:  What that means is that Fleetwood hit the ball and at the same time chopped

1044
01:05:26,375 --> 01:05:29,815
Speaker 1:  up a bunch of grass with his golf club. When he did, that's what a divot

1045
01:05:29,815 --> 01:05:33,575
Speaker 1:  is. The tracker, instead of picking up the ball, picked up the divot and

1046
01:05:33,575 --> 01:05:34,695
Speaker 1:  tracked it like the shot.

1047
01:05:35,195 --> 01:05:39,135
Speaker 12:  So it was an what we call an invalid reading in the rules. It was

1048
01:05:39,135 --> 01:05:42,935
Speaker 12:  fairly obvious very quickly to us what had happened. So we were able to

1049
01:05:42,935 --> 01:05:46,815
Speaker 12:  huddle with the rules, official inform 'em, and they were told the referee,

1050
01:05:46,915 --> 01:05:50,895
Speaker 12:  Hey, that this is a invalid reading. Our rules say that a

1051
01:05:51,015 --> 01:05:54,655
Speaker 12:  re-hit is allowed for no penalty. Please do that. And within a few seconds

1052
01:05:54,795 --> 01:05:58,375
Speaker 12:  that's what happened and Tommy hit the hit the shot again and

1053
01:05:58,945 --> 01:06:00,535
Speaker 12:  there was no issues with the second one.

1054
01:06:01,155 --> 01:06:04,885
Speaker 1:  Like Andrew said, that's in the rules, it went fine. It was a tough look

1055
01:06:04,885 --> 01:06:08,685
Speaker 1:  for TGL, but everyone got past it pretty fast. But it's also just

1056
01:06:08,825 --> 01:06:12,605
Speaker 1:  in a way fundamentally wrong. You know, I saw the ball

1057
01:06:12,745 --> 01:06:16,205
Speaker 1:  fly, I saw him hit it and it didn't do what the screen said it did.

1058
01:06:16,675 --> 01:06:20,645
Speaker 1:  That will never stop feeling strange and every time it happens, it gets

1059
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:24,405
Speaker 1:  a little harder to undo. Andrew says that TGL can fix

1060
01:06:24,405 --> 01:06:27,245
Speaker 1:  problems like that and that in fact they've made changes to the tech even

1061
01:06:27,255 --> 01:06:31,205
Speaker 1:  since that match and that tummy fleet would shot. But he does know there

1062
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:34,965
Speaker 1:  will be more edge cases and there's another challenge that the team is trying

1063
01:06:34,965 --> 01:06:38,525
Speaker 1:  to sort out, which is that no matter how big the screen is, it's still just

1064
01:06:38,645 --> 01:06:42,525
Speaker 1:  a huge two dimensional thing. When the TGL team was starting

1065
01:06:42,525 --> 01:06:46,325
Speaker 1:  out, they looked into 3D screens, bigger screens, smaller screens, more screens,

1066
01:06:46,325 --> 01:06:50,125
Speaker 1:  screen arrays, and Andrew did say he'd love to have as much screen as

1067
01:06:50,285 --> 01:06:53,285
Speaker 1:  he could possibly have. He at one point pointed up to the gap between the

1068
01:06:53,285 --> 01:06:56,325
Speaker 1:  screen and the ceiling and was basically like, what if there was more screen?

1069
01:06:57,025 --> 01:07:00,805
Speaker 1:  But this one is humongous and you still can't see it

1070
01:07:00,825 --> 01:07:04,445
Speaker 1:  the way that you see the real world, which I think created one of the most

1071
01:07:04,805 --> 01:07:08,725
Speaker 1:  fascinating moments of the whole year in TGL, which again happened

1072
01:07:08,845 --> 01:07:12,645
Speaker 1:  to Tiger Woods. So it's his turn to hit, he steps up and

1073
01:07:12,705 --> 01:07:15,805
Speaker 1:  he leans over to somebody and asks how far away he is, how

1074
01:07:15,805 --> 01:07:16,005
Speaker 15:  Far

1075
01:07:16,745 --> 01:07:17,485
Speaker 16:  99

1076
01:07:18,935 --> 01:07:22,285
Speaker 1:  Again, this is Tiger Woods we're talking about. So he knows what to do to

1077
01:07:22,285 --> 01:07:26,125
Speaker 1:  hit the ball 99 yards and it would be different if it were 101 yards or

1078
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:29,685
Speaker 1:  96 yards. That's how dialed in these guys are. These tiny

1079
01:07:29,685 --> 01:07:33,445
Speaker 1:  differences matter. But the thing is, tiger misheard, he

1080
01:07:33,445 --> 01:07:37,205
Speaker 1:  wasn't 99 yards away, he was 199

1081
01:07:37,205 --> 01:07:39,205
Speaker 1:  yards away. And so this happened.

1082
01:07:39,905 --> 01:07:43,805
Speaker 15:  No, I I heard you say 99, not 1 99

1083
01:07:44,645 --> 01:07:47,285
Speaker 15:  I I'm gonna have to do some investigative journalism. You know what the

1084
01:07:47,285 --> 01:07:50,645
Speaker 15:  hell? What the hell just happened? No, I I heard 99 yards. Sorry, I

1085
01:07:51,115 --> 01:07:53,085
Speaker 15:  grabbed my 56 and I hit a hundred yards.

1086
01:07:54,115 --> 01:07:57,965
Speaker 1:  This just wouldn't happen in real life golf. I mean I guarantee

1087
01:07:58,105 --> 01:08:01,365
Speaker 1:  you and I would both know the difference between being 99 yards away from

1088
01:08:01,365 --> 01:08:04,885
Speaker 1:  something and 199 yards away from something, you know what I mean?

1089
01:08:05,705 --> 01:08:09,525
Speaker 1:  But in Tiger's case, in this moment, he's 35 yards away from the screen.

1090
01:08:09,875 --> 01:08:13,605
Speaker 1:  He's always 35 yards away from the screen. He has to rely on the

1091
01:08:13,605 --> 01:08:17,565
Speaker 1:  technology to tell him the rest. The TGL players have actually been

1092
01:08:17,565 --> 01:08:21,205
Speaker 1:  saying all season that this has been one of the biggest challenges. They

1093
01:08:21,205 --> 01:08:25,045
Speaker 1:  play by sight and by feel and you just can't get that hitting the

1094
01:08:25,045 --> 01:08:29,005
Speaker 1:  ball into a screen even when it's a really big screen. The same is true

1095
01:08:29,005 --> 01:08:32,605
Speaker 1:  on the green by the way. One thing I heard tiger say is that the fact that

1096
01:08:33,105 --> 01:08:37,005
Speaker 1:  the TGL green is the same green but also a different

1097
01:08:37,005 --> 01:08:40,365
Speaker 1:  green every single time because they're able to change its rotation and its

1098
01:08:40,365 --> 01:08:44,325
Speaker 1:  shape really tripped him out. It's the same hole over and

1099
01:08:44,325 --> 01:08:47,365
Speaker 1:  over, but it's never ever the same hole and wrapping your head around that

1100
01:08:47,365 --> 01:08:51,125
Speaker 1:  turns out to be really complicated. Ultimately, this is why I think the

1101
01:08:51,245 --> 01:08:55,125
Speaker 1:  TGL question is fundamentally a technology one, can this

1102
01:08:55,225 --> 01:08:59,165
Speaker 1:  be golf or is it just something else? Take out

1103
01:08:59,225 --> 01:09:03,205
Speaker 1:  all of the issues that there have been. The truth is TGL doesn't even need

1104
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:06,965
Speaker 1:  to play by the rules of golf or even of physics or course design.

1105
01:09:07,295 --> 01:09:11,005
Speaker 1:  There are already a few holes in the TGL world

1106
01:09:11,115 --> 01:09:14,685
Speaker 1:  that are played around lava or on almost impossible

1107
01:09:14,795 --> 01:09:18,565
Speaker 1:  terrain. So like why not play TGL on the moon or in

1108
01:09:18,565 --> 01:09:22,365
Speaker 1:  some wild tron looking universe? The TGL folks

1109
01:09:22,385 --> 01:09:25,605
Speaker 1:  say that they're trying to strike a balance there, but it's a tricky one.

1110
01:09:25,605 --> 01:09:28,365
Speaker 1:  They want it to feel real. They want people who care about golf to care about

1111
01:09:28,645 --> 01:09:32,395
Speaker 1:  this, but they also need to embrace what's

1112
01:09:32,595 --> 01:09:36,555
Speaker 1:  possible here. And at least from where I sit, the more TGL tries

1113
01:09:36,555 --> 01:09:40,395
Speaker 1:  to feel like outdoor golf, the more obvious it becomes that the tech just

1114
01:09:40,405 --> 01:09:43,915
Speaker 1:  can't get there. That balance is tough for the golfers, but I think it's

1115
01:09:43,915 --> 01:09:47,675
Speaker 1:  even harder for viewers. How are you supposed to trust the

1116
01:09:47,675 --> 01:09:51,555
Speaker 1:  technology? Especially after seeing all the ways it can fail. There's

1117
01:09:51,555 --> 01:09:55,235
Speaker 1:  something pure and honest about sports. You watch the game and one team wins

1118
01:09:55,255 --> 01:09:58,715
Speaker 1:  and that's it. You sure fine complain about the refs and stuff and

1119
01:09:58,715 --> 01:10:02,275
Speaker 1:  everything's always unfair when your team loses, but fundamentally the game

1120
01:10:02,325 --> 01:10:06,275
Speaker 1:  tells the story. Ball don't lie. But here I look

1121
01:10:06,275 --> 01:10:09,915
Speaker 1:  at the YouTube comments on every TGL video and they're all just like, how

1122
01:10:09,915 --> 01:10:13,715
Speaker 1:  am I supposed to trust the physics engine here? TGL wants you to

1123
01:10:13,715 --> 01:10:17,315
Speaker 1:  bet on these matches. That's actually a big part of the plan. Are you gonna

1124
01:10:17,495 --> 01:10:20,915
Speaker 1:  bet on golf or are you gonna bet on computers working like they're supposed

1125
01:10:20,915 --> 01:10:24,835
Speaker 1:  to? And are those the same thing? Wouldn't you be easy to tweak the computers

1126
01:10:24,995 --> 01:10:28,715
Speaker 1:  to make people miss those shots? There's just something unknowable here,

1127
01:10:28,715 --> 01:10:32,515
Speaker 1:  something removed from real life that feels hard to overcome

1128
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:36,195
Speaker 1:  in a way that even playing a video game doesn't feel so hard to overcome.

1129
01:10:37,095 --> 01:10:40,275
Speaker 1:  The morning after the match, I went to the TGL folks were doing a tour for

1130
01:10:40,315 --> 01:10:43,435
Speaker 1:  a bunch of golf creators showing them how the tech works and letting them

1131
01:10:43,695 --> 01:10:47,115
Speaker 1:  hit into the huge screen to get a sense for themselves. I just sort of

1132
01:10:47,155 --> 01:10:50,835
Speaker 1:  sneakily jumped the line in jeans and sneakers, grabbed a club and

1133
01:10:50,835 --> 01:10:54,475
Speaker 1:  stepped out in front of the thing. All right, I gotta hit one good shot here.

1134
01:10:55,785 --> 01:10:58,435
Speaker 17:  Feel like I'm nervous. Whew.

1135
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:00,955
Speaker 17:  I don't even have anybody watching.

1136
01:11:01,855 --> 01:11:05,675
Speaker 1:  The TGL team told me that the whole setup, this whole arena is designed for

1137
01:11:05,675 --> 01:11:09,475
Speaker 1:  there to be one sweet spot where all the onscreen depth and

1138
01:11:09,475 --> 01:11:13,445
Speaker 1:  viewing angles and everything aligns exactly right. And that spot is right

1139
01:11:13,445 --> 01:11:17,005
Speaker 1:  here in the center on the tiny patch of grass where the player hits from.

1140
01:11:17,555 --> 01:11:21,085
Speaker 1:  It's kind of true standing there in the center. As the grass slopes away

1141
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:25,085
Speaker 1:  down from me and toward the screen 35 yards away, it does

1142
01:11:25,155 --> 01:11:29,125
Speaker 1:  feel more like I'm hitting a ball on a golf hole, but it also

1143
01:11:29,125 --> 01:11:32,965
Speaker 1:  feels like I'm hitting into a really big screen. I hit five shots,

1144
01:11:33,115 --> 01:11:36,285
Speaker 1:  some of which went okay and some of which went well,

1145
01:11:36,985 --> 01:11:37,485
Speaker 1:  not okay.

1146
01:11:39,905 --> 01:11:40,125
Speaker 18:  Ooh,

1147
01:11:40,345 --> 01:11:41,405
Speaker 1:  That's not going anywhere.

1148
01:11:43,325 --> 01:11:43,445
Speaker 18:  I,

1149
01:11:44,195 --> 01:11:47,965
Speaker 1:  Yeah, just seeing if it works. This was frankly very embarrassing to do in

1150
01:11:47,965 --> 01:11:51,005
Speaker 1:  front of a bunch of golf professionals, all of whom seem to have gorgeous

1151
01:11:51,145 --> 01:11:54,965
Speaker 1:  swings even though they're in marketing or it. But you know, I'm here for

1152
01:11:54,965 --> 01:11:58,845
Speaker 1:  journalism, right? Gotta see what happens when you suck. And they did

1153
01:11:58,845 --> 01:12:02,365
Speaker 1:  promise me that I'm not the worst they've ever seen, but they did also make

1154
01:12:02,365 --> 01:12:06,165
Speaker 1:  me promise not to reveal which celebrity hit a shot so bad. It broke part

1155
01:12:06,165 --> 01:12:09,845
Speaker 1:  of the screen on the side where it shows the scoreboard and stats, which

1156
01:12:09,845 --> 01:12:13,765
Speaker 1:  is why there's now a net that covers that screen. I really enjoyed my TGL

1157
01:12:13,765 --> 01:12:17,245
Speaker 1:  experience, I've enjoyed it all year and TGL has been a hit this year.

1158
01:12:17,555 --> 01:12:21,125
Speaker 1:  It's only year one and basically everybody who works there tells me they

1159
01:12:21,125 --> 01:12:24,805
Speaker 1:  have lots of ideas about how to make it better for next season. That has

1160
01:12:24,805 --> 01:12:28,725
Speaker 1:  to do with both the technology and with the way that the

1161
01:12:28,725 --> 01:12:32,325
Speaker 1:  game itself is actually played. They all understand that even the rules of

1162
01:12:32,325 --> 01:12:36,165
Speaker 1:  this are not fixed yet. There are also still a lot of golf

1163
01:12:36,195 --> 01:12:40,165
Speaker 1:  purists and fans who think the whole thing is weird and bad and just

1164
01:12:40,165 --> 01:12:43,485
Speaker 1:  kind of hokey, but the ratings have been solid. People are talking about

1165
01:12:43,485 --> 01:12:47,005
Speaker 1:  the league, tiger and Rory and the others seem to be having fun

1166
01:12:47,445 --> 01:12:50,765
Speaker 1:  honestly, and that might be the most important part. The playoffs start this

1167
01:12:50,765 --> 01:12:53,405
Speaker 1:  week and I'll definitely be watching, I've been watching more of this season

1168
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:57,325
Speaker 1:  than I actually expected, but the question is still right there and someone

1169
01:12:57,425 --> 01:13:01,205
Speaker 1:  is going to need to answer It. Is this golf or is this video games?

1170
01:13:01,395 --> 01:13:05,325
Speaker 1:  Does the distinction even necessarily matter? And when one

1171
01:13:05,325 --> 01:13:08,965
Speaker 1:  of the world's best golfers steps in and wax the ball into the screen,

1172
01:13:09,475 --> 01:13:13,285
Speaker 1:  what is supposed to happen in the real world ball? Don't lie,

1173
01:13:13,945 --> 01:13:17,525
Speaker 1:  but on the screen it can actually do pretty much whatever you want it to,

1174
01:13:18,065 --> 01:13:20,205
Speaker 1:  but you at some point have to decide what that is.

1175
01:13:21,785 --> 01:13:25,285
Speaker 1:  All right, that's enough golf talk for now. We need to take a break and then

1176
01:13:25,285 --> 01:13:28,285
Speaker 1:  we're gonna come back and take a question from the forecast hotline. We'll

1177
01:13:28,285 --> 01:13:28,645
Speaker 1:  be right back

1178
01:14:52,495 --> 01:14:55,935
Speaker 19:  I am, my name is Ben, I'm a senior in college. I'll be graduating here in

1179
01:14:55,935 --> 01:14:59,895
Speaker 19:  a couple weeks. Wanted to talk about iPad. I know you

1180
01:15:00,135 --> 01:15:03,575
Speaker 19:  recommend that everyone stick with the base iPad and that's probably a good

1181
01:15:03,575 --> 01:15:07,535
Speaker 19:  recommendation for most people. But I wanted to advocate

1182
01:15:07,535 --> 01:15:11,415
Speaker 19:  for the iPad Air just a little bit for one group of

1183
01:15:11,415 --> 01:15:15,295
Speaker 19:  people in particular, which is college students. I, like many

1184
01:15:15,315 --> 01:15:19,135
Speaker 19:  of my friends in college use an iPad for note taking and use an app like

1185
01:15:19,185 --> 01:15:20,455
Speaker 19:  Notability or

1186
01:15:22,605 --> 01:15:25,855
Speaker 19:  Good Notes and I don't know if you've used either of these apps, but they're

1187
01:15:25,935 --> 01:15:29,535
Speaker 19:  a lot better for the type of note taking that college students do than Apple's

1188
01:15:29,535 --> 01:15:33,255
Speaker 19:  inbuilt Notes app. And they also tend

1189
01:15:33,435 --> 01:15:37,375
Speaker 19:  to be pretty intense on iPads. Like my

1190
01:15:37,375 --> 01:15:41,335
Speaker 19:  2021 iPad Pro can get pretty warm while I'm working

1191
01:15:41,335 --> 01:15:43,295
Speaker 19:  with a big document in Notability.

1192
01:15:45,575 --> 01:15:48,955
Speaker 19:  So you know, the other thing I wanted to say is a lot of college students

1193
01:15:48,985 --> 01:15:52,795
Speaker 19:  come out of high school with some gift money or some more money

1194
01:15:52,815 --> 01:15:56,755
Speaker 19:  to spend. So five 50 for the extra head room with

1195
01:15:56,755 --> 01:16:00,675
Speaker 19:  the M three processor now I believe It is for an iPad air

1196
01:16:00,935 --> 01:16:04,675
Speaker 19:  is pretty reasonable because you know, I just had to

1197
01:16:04,675 --> 01:16:08,475
Speaker 19:  replace my laptop halfway through college 'cause my X PS 15

1198
01:16:08,715 --> 01:16:12,475
Speaker 19:  crapped out on me. And I think that spending the additional money up front

1199
01:16:12,575 --> 01:16:16,395
Speaker 19:  to get that more headroom, especially for someone who's using the

1200
01:16:16,425 --> 01:16:20,035
Speaker 19:  iPad for something that's not just Netflix is probably worth it in

1201
01:16:20,615 --> 01:16:24,195
Speaker 19:  my opinion. I think that's what a lot of people are doing in school and

1202
01:16:24,195 --> 01:16:28,115
Speaker 19:  I think that's where the biggest chunk of iPad air users come from,

1203
01:16:28,405 --> 01:16:32,075
Speaker 19:  especially when it's five 50 with an education

1204
01:16:32,275 --> 01:16:34,555
Speaker 19:  discount. So that's just my thoughts.

1205
01:16:35,595 --> 01:16:39,475
Speaker 1:  I picked this one to play this week because this reflects feedback

1206
01:16:39,475 --> 01:16:42,955
Speaker 1:  we've heard a lot over the last several weeks in a few ways actually.

1207
01:16:43,895 --> 01:16:47,875
Speaker 1:  One is just that it turns out that people who

1208
01:16:47,905 --> 01:16:51,835
Speaker 1:  want to take notes with a mix of a keyboard

1209
01:16:52,175 --> 01:16:56,155
Speaker 1:  and a pencil much more popular than I expected. That sounds sort of silly

1210
01:16:56,155 --> 01:16:59,755
Speaker 1:  to say now that is like the whole purpose of the iPad, but

1211
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:03,835
Speaker 1:  I've always thought of that as kind of a cool feature. But one of

1212
01:17:03,835 --> 01:17:06,555
Speaker 1:  those things that you think you're gonna wanna do a lot more than you actually

1213
01:17:06,555 --> 01:17:10,165
Speaker 1:  wanna do and that most people gravitate towards one or the other. But I think

1214
01:17:10,465 --> 01:17:14,325
Speaker 1:  in certain parts of the world and in certain kinds of jobs and

1215
01:17:14,325 --> 01:17:17,485
Speaker 1:  certainly for students, which is a thing I heard a lot about the last few

1216
01:17:17,485 --> 01:17:21,085
Speaker 1:  weeks, that is really powerful. That mix of

1217
01:17:21,525 --> 01:17:24,645
Speaker 1:  I can set this down on a desk and use it like a laptop with really long battery

1218
01:17:24,645 --> 01:17:28,485
Speaker 1:  life but I can also just flip it flat on the table and use it with a

1219
01:17:28,485 --> 01:17:32,325
Speaker 1:  pencil. Super powerful. And I think that

1220
01:17:32,905 --> 01:17:36,365
Speaker 1:  as we said in the hotline, here is one of the best cases

1221
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:40,845
Speaker 1:  both for the iPad in general but also for upgrading from the base iPad

1222
01:17:40,845 --> 01:17:44,205
Speaker 1:  to something like the Air or even the pro you get the better

1223
01:17:44,205 --> 01:17:47,845
Speaker 1:  accessories, you get that versatility, you get just

1224
01:17:47,985 --> 01:17:51,805
Speaker 1:  the sheer everythingness of the iPad and if you're gonna

1225
01:17:51,805 --> 01:17:55,765
Speaker 1:  buy an iPad, the point is to get something that can do things your laptop

1226
01:17:55,855 --> 01:17:59,805
Speaker 1:  can't, right? Like I really think if you are thinking about should I use

1227
01:17:59,805 --> 01:18:03,645
Speaker 1:  this as my main computer, the question is not will it be better on an iPad

1228
01:18:03,665 --> 01:18:07,325
Speaker 1:  or will it be more seamless on an iPad or can I do more stuff on the iPad?

1229
01:18:07,885 --> 01:18:11,325
Speaker 1:  'cause the answer is usually no. The iPad is a pretty locked down system

1230
01:18:11,845 --> 01:18:15,765
Speaker 1:  compared to the Mac or Windows. But there are things you can do on

1231
01:18:15,765 --> 01:18:19,725
Speaker 1:  it like physically that you can't with a Mac. And so if you start

1232
01:18:19,725 --> 01:18:23,245
Speaker 1:  from I need something I can write on with a pencil sometimes

1233
01:18:23,505 --> 01:18:26,965
Speaker 1:  of course you should buy an iPad and you should buy something that gives

1234
01:18:26,985 --> 01:18:30,605
Speaker 1:  you access to the best accessories. So that right there might be the best

1235
01:18:30,605 --> 01:18:34,485
Speaker 1:  case I've ever heard for an easy upgrade from the base

1236
01:18:34,675 --> 01:18:38,565
Speaker 1:  iPad to the air or the pro thing. Number two, there

1237
01:18:38,925 --> 01:18:42,885
Speaker 1:  are apps like Notability and Good Notes, both of which are fabulous apps

1238
01:18:42,945 --> 01:18:46,805
Speaker 1:  by the way. Notability in particular is one of the apps that Apple will

1239
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:50,685
Speaker 1:  often show in its demos to show you how good some

1240
01:18:50,685 --> 01:18:54,645
Speaker 1:  of the new features are. It requires a ton of processing power. It does

1241
01:18:54,705 --> 01:18:57,925
Speaker 1:  really interesting stuff with handwriting. It's built in some of the AI features.

1242
01:18:58,255 --> 01:19:02,165
Speaker 1:  Notability in particular I think is like one of the best and most iPad,

1243
01:19:02,715 --> 01:19:06,645
Speaker 1:  iPad apps anywhere. It's excellent and It is as

1244
01:19:06,645 --> 01:19:10,525
Speaker 1:  we were just talking about, the kind of thing you can't do in the same

1245
01:19:10,545 --> 01:19:14,525
Speaker 1:  way on any other device. And those things do want a lot of extra performance.

1246
01:19:14,525 --> 01:19:18,485
Speaker 1:  So again, if you want to do something like that, I think I may have slightly

1247
01:19:18,795 --> 01:19:22,645
Speaker 1:  overrated how powerful some of these powerful

1248
01:19:22,645 --> 01:19:26,125
Speaker 1:  apps need to be, right? I think a lot about things like

1249
01:19:26,235 --> 01:19:30,045
Speaker 1:  Photoshop and Lightroom and Logic and Final Cut, these like heavy

1250
01:19:30,885 --> 01:19:34,725
Speaker 1:  graphics intensive editing processes that some people do and some people

1251
01:19:34,725 --> 01:19:38,605
Speaker 1:  like to do on an iPad. But there is a level below that that is like

1252
01:19:38,925 --> 01:19:42,845
Speaker 1:  I just need to have lots of images in my notes and I need to be

1253
01:19:42,845 --> 01:19:46,085
Speaker 1:  able to write quickly and I need to be able to flip between a thousand pages

1254
01:19:46,145 --> 01:19:49,725
Speaker 1:  and do the character recognition and search. And that stuff requires real

1255
01:19:49,755 --> 01:19:53,485
Speaker 1:  performance and you can do it on a base iPad, but again you will notice

1256
01:19:53,585 --> 01:19:57,165
Speaker 1:  the difference. So I think that's meaningful. Thing number three, and this

1257
01:19:57,165 --> 01:20:00,165
Speaker 1:  is another one I've been thinking a lot about the last few weeks. The price

1258
01:20:00,165 --> 01:20:03,685
Speaker 1:  of an iPad is not a simple thing to understand.

1259
01:20:04,205 --> 01:20:07,405
Speaker 1:  I think this is true of phones too in a way that with laptops it really isn't.

1260
01:20:07,515 --> 01:20:11,445
Speaker 1:  Laptops kind of cost what they cost sometimes that are on sale, but the price

1261
01:20:11,735 --> 01:20:15,645
Speaker 1:  there is reasonably assumed to be the price most people

1262
01:20:15,645 --> 01:20:19,485
Speaker 1:  are going to pay. Not true with iPads. iPads have huge corporate discounts.

1263
01:20:19,495 --> 01:20:22,805
Speaker 1:  iPads have huge education discounts. You can often get last year's model

1264
01:20:22,805 --> 01:20:26,365
Speaker 1:  on a pretty big discount. You can find them on like holiday

1265
01:20:26,765 --> 01:20:30,445
Speaker 1:  discounts in a way that a lot of Apple products in particular don't get discounted.

1266
01:20:30,905 --> 01:20:34,645
Speaker 1:  So the idea of I can upgrade a little

1267
01:20:35,105 --> 01:20:39,005
Speaker 1:  and either get last year's model much cheaper or this year's model with some

1268
01:20:39,205 --> 01:20:42,725
Speaker 1:  discount that I have access to and thus instead of spending you know, 300

1269
01:20:42,725 --> 01:20:46,605
Speaker 1:  more dollars on an iPad, I'm spending like 150 more dollars on an

1270
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:50,325
Speaker 1:  iPad, then the upgrade becomes very compelling. So I think

1271
01:20:50,635 --> 01:20:54,485
Speaker 1:  this is a path that I maybe have underrated in thinking about the iPad.

1272
01:20:54,725 --> 01:20:58,285
Speaker 1:  I still think that if you are a person who wants to like hold an iPad in

1273
01:20:58,285 --> 01:21:01,285
Speaker 1:  your hand and watch movies on a plane or give it to your kids so they can

1274
01:21:01,285 --> 01:21:05,165
Speaker 1:  play games or I don't know, do the New York Times spelling D

1275
01:21:05,165 --> 01:21:08,885
Speaker 1:  every morning, that's like perfect iPad activities and they are

1276
01:21:08,945 --> 01:21:12,565
Speaker 1:  so well served by every iPad in the line, including the base one.

1277
01:21:13,145 --> 01:21:16,685
Speaker 1:  But there is a kind of base productivity

1278
01:21:16,745 --> 01:21:20,605
Speaker 1:  device that the iPad can be that isn't quite laptop replacement.

1279
01:21:20,605 --> 01:21:24,525
Speaker 1:  In fact part of the point is that it's not a laptop replacement but

1280
01:21:24,525 --> 01:21:28,365
Speaker 1:  It is almost that kind of thing. It can do things

1281
01:21:28,365 --> 01:21:31,845
Speaker 1:  your laptop can't, it can do things, your laptop can, but it gives you that

1282
01:21:31,845 --> 01:21:35,605
Speaker 1:  same kind of all in one machine. You do want

1283
01:21:35,865 --> 01:21:39,405
Speaker 1:  the performance upgrade there, especially if you're gonna use it even through

1284
01:21:39,465 --> 01:21:43,165
Speaker 1:  all four years of college, right? Like that's, that's a long time in device

1285
01:21:43,185 --> 01:21:47,125
Speaker 1:  cycles. And I think buying something with more power based on the idea that

1286
01:21:47,325 --> 01:21:51,085
Speaker 1:  I might want to do more with it and also it's just going to get harder

1287
01:21:51,185 --> 01:21:54,785
Speaker 1:  to do these things over time. That's great reason to upgrade an iPad.

1288
01:21:55,005 --> 01:21:58,505
Speaker 1:  So I just wanted to share this because this and all the feedback I've gotten

1289
01:21:58,655 --> 01:22:02,505
Speaker 1:  like this has really changed how I think about the upgrade path of an

1290
01:22:02,575 --> 01:22:06,505
Speaker 1:  iPad. And I think Apple really would like to lead you all the

1291
01:22:06,505 --> 01:22:09,865
Speaker 1:  way up to the pro. And I think that's harder, right? Like I think the leap

1292
01:22:09,935 --> 01:22:13,345
Speaker 1:  from, I need all this stuff so I should get an air all the way up to like,

1293
