Description: The Verge's Nilay Patel, David Pierce, and Alex Cranz discuss the Apple Vision Pro review rating, changes to the TikTok app, streaming news, and more.

2
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:19,435
Speaker 2:  Hello. And Welcome. To Vergecast, the flagship podcast of putting windows

3
00:01:19,655 --> 00:01:23,595
Speaker 2:  all around you and then walking around them and looking at

4
00:01:23,595 --> 00:01:25,555
Speaker 2:  them and being in the future.

5
00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:29,235
Speaker 5:  The future. Yeah, that's iTunes most specific genre.

6
00:01:33,665 --> 00:01:37,195
Speaker 2:  It's Vergecast. I'm your friend NELI. David Pierce is here. Hi Alex. Cranz

7
00:01:37,215 --> 00:01:38,195
Speaker 2:  is here. Hi. I'm your

8
00:01:38,195 --> 00:01:41,785
Speaker 7:  Friend that really misses Microsoft's windows.

9
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:45,145
Speaker 2:  The HoloLens people are so mad at me.

10
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:49,625
Speaker 2:  They're like, how did you do this whole review? And you never mentioned HoloLens,

11
00:01:49,965 --> 00:01:53,705
Speaker 2:  the thing that invented spatial compute, and it's true, Microsoft invented

12
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:57,185
Speaker 2:  a number of these words with no regard for what they meant.

13
00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:02,625
Speaker 2:  They're like, HoloLens is mixed reality. That means augmented reality,

14
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:06,945
Speaker 2:  this VR headset and windows. That's Windows mixed reality. Like just

15
00:02:07,945 --> 00:02:10,785
Speaker 2:  anything. Yeah, any, all the words meant the same thing. And I have done

16
00:02:10,785 --> 00:02:14,685
Speaker 2:  some very cool HoloLens demos in my life. I put on a

17
00:02:14,685 --> 00:02:18,605
Speaker 2:  HoloLens and I changed a spark plug on an A TV in

18
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:21,765
Speaker 2:  the basement of a Microsoft building and it it guided me.

19
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:26,455
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it put arrows like, go to this drawer, open this drawer, I

20
00:02:26,455 --> 00:02:28,615
Speaker 2:  don Dunno if any of that was real or if it was totally state, whatever it

21
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:31,615
Speaker 2:  was awesome. I was like, this is definitely the future of changing spark

22
00:02:31,615 --> 00:02:34,935
Speaker 2:  plugs in an A TV as long as the room is set out exactly right and the computer

23
00:02:34,935 --> 00:02:38,775
Speaker 2:  knows where all the parts are. Like this is how we should change spark plugs.

24
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:42,015
Speaker 2:  Which by the way, if you set up the room exactly right and you know where

25
00:02:42,015 --> 00:02:44,935
Speaker 2:  all the parts are, you no longer need the computer to change the spark plugs

26
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:45,335
Speaker 2:  because you

27
00:02:45,335 --> 00:02:46,735
Speaker 5:  Put the spark plugs where they go,

28
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:47,615
Speaker 6:  It's,

29
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:51,935
Speaker 2:  But whatever. You outsource that. But they were like, imagine a, a mechanic

30
00:02:51,955 --> 00:02:55,535
Speaker 2:  on an airline. And now I'm like, man, I wish Boeing had bought more HoloLens.

31
00:02:55,645 --> 00:02:59,605
Speaker 2:  They're also in Seattle. Just putting that out there. Microsoft, the

32
00:02:59,605 --> 00:03:03,165
Speaker 2:  problem with the, the HoloLens, oh, and I did a very cool demo. Microsoft,

33
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:07,525
Speaker 2:  one of the few companies in VR that has ever solved co-location.

34
00:03:08,665 --> 00:03:12,505
Speaker 2:  So I wore a HoloLens and someone else was wearing a HoloLens and

35
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:16,235
Speaker 2:  we were looking at the same thing at the same time. And like I would

36
00:03:16,555 --> 00:03:19,875
Speaker 2:  interact with, it was like a model of something and I would interact with

37
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:23,755
Speaker 2:  it and they would spin it the other way. And no one else, as

38
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:26,475
Speaker 2:  far as I can know, very no other company is on a, a commercial scale. I don't

39
00:03:26,475 --> 00:03:29,955
Speaker 2:  think the Quest headsets can do that. The Vision Pro can't do it. Okay, that's

40
00:03:29,955 --> 00:03:30,315
Speaker 7:  Cool then.

41
00:03:30,485 --> 00:03:34,315
Speaker 2:  Right? So I, I to all credit to HoloLens, the HoloLens

42
00:03:34,335 --> 00:03:38,115
Speaker 2:  is a gigantic failure, which is why I

43
00:03:38,115 --> 00:03:41,755
Speaker 2:  didn't mention it. It failed as a product.

44
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:46,355
Speaker 2:  The person who was leading the project got forced out of Microsoft for sexual

45
00:03:46,355 --> 00:03:49,915
Speaker 2:  misconduct allegations. They did a bunch of layoffs on the team.

46
00:03:50,225 --> 00:03:53,835
Speaker 2:  They've reorganized their hardware portfolio and they say quote, and this

47
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:56,915
Speaker 2:  is a real quote, we'll make a next version of the HoloLens when the time

48
00:03:56,935 --> 00:03:57,315
Speaker 2:  is right.

49
00:03:57,735 --> 00:03:59,635
Speaker 7:  Oh, there you is. It is it. Right.

50
00:04:00,255 --> 00:04:00,475
Speaker 2:  No,

51
00:04:02,815 --> 00:04:05,795
Speaker 2:  you know what they're gonna do? They're gonna make a bunch of AI stuff and

52
00:04:05,795 --> 00:04:09,555
Speaker 2:  print money instead of being like, you can change a spark plug with our glasses

53
00:04:09,735 --> 00:04:09,955
Speaker 2:  on.

54
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:13,795
Speaker 7:  Oh, I'll, I'll never be able to change a spark plug

55
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,235
Speaker 2:  Though. Yeah. Anyway, so shout out to the HoloLens people. I just,

56
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:20,115
Speaker 5:  HoloLens also objectively the coolest product name in this entire

57
00:04:20,395 --> 00:04:20,555
Speaker 5:  category.

58
00:04:20,935 --> 00:04:21,795
Speaker 7:  Oh yeah. A hundred

59
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:24,075
Speaker 5:  Percent. No question. HoloLens kicks ass.

60
00:04:24,545 --> 00:04:27,315
Speaker 2:  It's good. It's a good name. Yeah. And the first one was cool and the second

61
00:04:27,315 --> 00:04:30,075
Speaker 2:  one was even better. From what I'm told, I never tried the second one. And

62
00:04:30,295 --> 00:04:33,995
Speaker 2:  you know, if, if you have the perfect spark plug set up,

63
00:04:35,295 --> 00:04:35,515
Speaker 7:  Are

64
00:04:35,515 --> 00:04:36,955
Speaker 2:  You that thing kicked ass?

65
00:04:37,135 --> 00:04:40,075
Speaker 7:  Are you saying you, you don't fondly remember the Acer ah,

66
00:04:40,735 --> 00:04:44,555
Speaker 7:  1 0 1 db EY

67
00:04:44,555 --> 00:04:47,915
Speaker 7:  Windows mixed reality headset that had a good day. That's a good ring. Say

68
00:04:47,795 --> 00:04:47,915
Speaker 7:  it

69
00:04:47,915 --> 00:04:48,635
Speaker 5:  Slower. Slower.

70
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:53,115
Speaker 2:  But Addie and I just decided what the words would mean in our

71
00:04:53,115 --> 00:04:55,755
Speaker 2:  review. We made a sidebar. We're like, this is what mixed reality means and

72
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:58,035
Speaker 2:  this is what augmented reality means. And then Addie was like, you know,

73
00:04:58,035 --> 00:05:00,995
Speaker 2:  this is a flip of how Microsoft wanted it. And it's like, I don't care.

74
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:05,435
Speaker 2:  Like I'm putting my foot in the ground and this is what we're saying. Anyhow,

75
00:05:05,435 --> 00:05:09,275
Speaker 2:  so that shout out to the HoloLens people. I feel you. It was a cool

76
00:05:09,305 --> 00:05:09,595
Speaker 2:  demo.

77
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:11,755
Speaker 5:  Did any magic leap people get at you?

78
00:05:11,935 --> 00:05:14,115
Speaker 2:  The Magic Leap people were just happy to be mentioned,

79
00:05:15,725 --> 00:05:19,675
Speaker 2:  Right? Like your product is a true AR product. Optical AR

80
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:22,755
Speaker 2:  that has fatal compromises in it and no one should buy. They're like, oh

81
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:26,715
Speaker 2:  my God. Finally the validation we deserve some people, I

82
00:05:26,715 --> 00:05:30,555
Speaker 2:  will say two things. Some people, I basically called the top on

83
00:05:30,575 --> 00:05:34,315
Speaker 2:  two technologies in this review. I said, camera based pass

84
00:05:34,315 --> 00:05:38,115
Speaker 2:  through has is might be a dead end. And I, I feel that it might be a dead

85
00:05:38,115 --> 00:05:42,015
Speaker 2:  end. And I said, hand and eye tracking it. There's a

86
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:45,255
Speaker 2:  part of it that's valuable for some things, but it's also a dead end. It

87
00:05:45,255 --> 00:05:49,175
Speaker 2:  cannot be the primary input. And I heard from people who've been working

88
00:05:49,175 --> 00:05:50,175
Speaker 2:  on this who have shipped, wait,

89
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:52,855
Speaker 5:  Sorry, real quick. We should just say, by the way, this is your review of

90
00:05:52,855 --> 00:05:55,575
Speaker 5:  the Vision Pro, which went up this week. We talked a bunch about it on Tuesday.

91
00:05:55,765 --> 00:05:59,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah, yeah. But if, if you, if you haven't been living inside of Eli's brain

92
00:05:59,505 --> 00:06:02,525
Speaker 5:  for the last week or so, he's talking about the Apple Fission Pro,

93
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:05,045
Speaker 5:  which we just got to so fast.

94
00:06:07,725 --> 00:06:10,725
Speaker 2:  I was gonna say that's what I, no, this is right. I woke up, I used this

95
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:14,445
Speaker 2:  app called Sleep Cycle on my, to my, my alarm clock. And

96
00:06:14,445 --> 00:06:18,405
Speaker 2:  yesterday I woke up and it basically congratulated me on finally

97
00:06:18,405 --> 00:06:21,925
Speaker 2:  getting some sleep. Oh boy. It was like, good job. You've got

98
00:06:22,035 --> 00:06:25,645
Speaker 2:  400% more sleep last night than you've been getting.

99
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:30,365
Speaker 2:  And I was like, this is a disaster. So yeah, I'm wired now. I've like got

100
00:06:30,365 --> 00:06:33,805
Speaker 2:  too much sleep. But the amount of caffeine, I've basically only eaten Cinnamon

101
00:06:33,885 --> 00:06:37,045
Speaker 2:  Toast Crunch this week. It's bad. All of it's bad. The inside of

102
00:06:37,045 --> 00:06:39,165
Speaker 7:  Your mouth after that much Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

103
00:06:39,715 --> 00:06:43,325
Speaker 2:  Well, I didn't eat it all in one go. Yeah, but it's, it's cumulative.

104
00:06:43,595 --> 00:06:46,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It it's cumulative in that each bowl is 25 grams of sugar.

105
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:53,845
Speaker 2:  We'll miss you. Yeah. I'm just like, why the crash is gonna be bad.

106
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,885
Speaker 2:  We're not buying this anymore. But that's, I would like get home and be like,

107
00:06:56,885 --> 00:07:00,805
Speaker 2:  what can I eat? You know, like fast cereal cereal and I was like this

108
00:07:00,805 --> 00:07:04,455
Speaker 2:  cereal. Anyhow. Yes. Vision Pro Review. I heard

109
00:07:04,635 --> 00:07:08,315
Speaker 2:  the, the, the two things in my view that I, that were like the big

110
00:07:08,315 --> 00:07:12,075
Speaker 2:  ideas that I didn't overly highlight is a Vision Pro is the best version

111
00:07:12,135 --> 00:07:15,275
Speaker 2:  of a device with camera based pass through and hand and eye tracking they've

112
00:07:15,275 --> 00:07:18,155
Speaker 2:  ever seen. And I was like, it might have inadvertently proved that these

113
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:21,395
Speaker 2:  are deadheads and I have heard from people who have shipped

114
00:07:21,795 --> 00:07:25,675
Speaker 2:  millions of devices with camera pass through and who have invested

115
00:07:25,675 --> 00:07:29,435
Speaker 2:  millions upon billions of dollars and hand and eye tracking. And they

116
00:07:29,635 --> 00:07:32,995
Speaker 2:  were like, you have a point about camera pass through.

117
00:07:33,865 --> 00:07:37,675
Speaker 2:  It's good for what it's good for and like it's not a dead

118
00:07:37,735 --> 00:07:41,035
Speaker 2:  end if you use it. Right. But Apple's trying to make it do too much, which

119
00:07:41,035 --> 00:07:42,155
Speaker 2:  I thought was really interesting feedback.

120
00:07:42,255 --> 00:07:45,595
Speaker 5:  That's fair. Because it is like on the, on the Quest three, it's useful in

121
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:48,915
Speaker 5:  spots, right? It's like the, I'm playing a VR game and I like double tap

122
00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:52,635
Speaker 5:  on the headset and it opens up So I can like see what's around me or whether

123
00:07:52,755 --> 00:07:55,555
Speaker 5:  I just kicked my dog or whatever. But it's not like you don't, you don't

124
00:07:55,555 --> 00:07:58,235
Speaker 5:  live in the pass through. And so for that, I think pass through works fine.

125
00:07:58,235 --> 00:08:01,515
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Apple is like default state is passed through and I think, I think

126
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:03,595
Speaker 5:  that might be where it's pushing too hard.

127
00:08:03,665 --> 00:08:07,435
Speaker 2:  There's a really cool app that Gen two E posted on the site where

128
00:08:07,435 --> 00:08:10,875
Speaker 2:  it's shortcuts. Yeah. And you can put it the shortcuts all around your house.

129
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,795
Speaker 2:  So you get all these shortcuts by your TV and all this stuff and that's really

130
00:08:13,795 --> 00:08:16,475
Speaker 2:  cool. It's like, oh, but to use that, you have to word this all the time.

131
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:20,275
Speaker 2:  Right? So not no longer useful. So it, this is the

132
00:08:20,435 --> 00:08:22,595
Speaker 2:  argument, this is a simulator of what Apple really wants, but they're like,

133
00:08:22,595 --> 00:08:26,515
Speaker 2:  look, camera pass through has its uses, but if you try to

134
00:08:26,515 --> 00:08:29,675
Speaker 2:  pretend it's ar you're gonna run into the problem. We agree with you there.

135
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,995
Speaker 2:  And then the note about eye tracking and this person has spent a lot of money

136
00:08:33,995 --> 00:08:37,955
Speaker 2:  on eye tracking in their life was you are overloading an

137
00:08:38,045 --> 00:08:41,725
Speaker 2:  input channel by trying to use it for output, which is

138
00:08:42,485 --> 00:08:42,805
Speaker 2:  fascinating.

139
00:08:42,985 --> 00:08:43,845
Speaker 5:  We had explain, so

140
00:08:43,845 --> 00:08:47,485
Speaker 2:  Your eyes are an input channel, so you're used to taking in a lot of

141
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,805
Speaker 2:  information with your eyes or an input channel and then you overload it by

142
00:08:50,805 --> 00:08:54,405
Speaker 2:  trying to use it as an output channel to control the device. Oh, that's smart.

143
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:58,605
Speaker 2:  And so the the, the feedback was you, you hit on something that

144
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:01,405
Speaker 2:  this industry has been talking about for a long time. Hmm. Yeah. Which is

145
00:09:01,505 --> 00:09:03,965
Speaker 2:  you can't overload your input channels as output channels. And you'll run

146
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:06,005
Speaker 2:  into this problem with eye tracking because you have to look at what you

147
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:08,645
Speaker 2:  wanna look at and you have to look at what you wanna control instead of what

148
00:09:08,645 --> 00:09:09,165
Speaker 2:  you're looking at.

149
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:12,925
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Because historically eye tracking was just to like enhance it.

150
00:09:13,025 --> 00:09:16,805
Speaker 7:  So like if you kind of glanced to one side, the camera would move so you'd

151
00:09:16,805 --> 00:09:18,765
Speaker 7:  see what was ever whatever was over there. Yeah. That's

152
00:09:18,765 --> 00:09:20,325
Speaker 2:  Like render, that's foveated rendering,

153
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:22,005
Speaker 7:  Right? Yeah. And it didn't really well

154
00:09:22,005 --> 00:09:23,925
Speaker 2:  Like, but that's to save processor cycles.

155
00:09:24,095 --> 00:09:27,285
Speaker 7:  Right. But no, it it also made it a smoother experience. It made it like

156
00:09:27,555 --> 00:09:29,525
Speaker 7:  less, oh I'm just staring at some screens. Oh

157
00:09:29,525 --> 00:09:31,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah, yeah. So you It's a blurry. Yeah.

158
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:34,165
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It made it a nice experience. And even when you do it just on a regular

159
00:09:34,585 --> 00:09:38,205
Speaker 7:  laptop screen, I did a, I reviewed way too many Toby laptops once

160
00:09:38,355 --> 00:09:42,245
Speaker 7:  upon the time. It was really useful 'cause you could just kind of look at

161
00:09:42,245 --> 00:09:45,565
Speaker 7:  things and, and it would pop up and make it a little brighter and make it

162
00:09:45,565 --> 00:09:49,405
Speaker 7:  a little easier. But like anytime I would try to like control the computer

163
00:09:49,405 --> 00:09:52,805
Speaker 7:  with it, I was like, oh I hate this. Yeah. Because I'd like glance at my

164
00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:55,445
Speaker 7:  watch and my character just start running around in circles.

165
00:09:55,555 --> 00:09:58,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And this is overloading and input channels output. So you, when you

166
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:01,645
Speaker 2:  use it the way you're describing Yeah. For foveated rendering for highlights.

167
00:10:01,645 --> 00:10:05,165
Speaker 2:  Right. That make it a little brighter. You're enhancing the input channel.

168
00:10:05,175 --> 00:10:08,565
Speaker 2:  Right. When you use an output channel, you might overload yourself. So this

169
00:10:08,565 --> 00:10:10,925
Speaker 2:  person was like, yeah, in the history of eye tracking, this is a thing that

170
00:10:10,925 --> 00:10:14,525
Speaker 2:  we understand. And then they said, I had it wrong

171
00:10:14,825 --> 00:10:18,125
Speaker 2:  on hand tracking. Oh, that there's, the industry

172
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,845
Speaker 2:  believes in hand tracking. They're gonna get it right because it is the most

173
00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:25,085
Speaker 2:  natural way of doing things and there's a lot of work being done.

174
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,885
Speaker 2:  I keep pointing at it's the computer is always washing hands and the vision,

175
00:10:29,205 --> 00:10:32,045
Speaker 2:  regardless of that joke, the Vision Pro does mis register. A lot of hand

176
00:10:32,045 --> 00:10:34,805
Speaker 2:  input also cannot differentiate between your hands and someone else's hands.

177
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:38,965
Speaker 7:  Also, you personally look really goofy doing it in the office.

178
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:40,765
Speaker 7:  It's, it was so good. Wait,

179
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,845
Speaker 5:  Hold on. So if you're just sitting at your desk on the Vision Pro, I can

180
00:10:43,845 --> 00:10:47,685
Speaker 5:  just stick my hands in front of your face and start literally typing

181
00:10:47,745 --> 00:10:48,485
Speaker 5:  on your keyboard.

182
00:10:48,925 --> 00:10:52,245
Speaker 2:  Sure can. Or, or you can just put your hand in front and click your fingers

183
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,445
Speaker 2:  together and it'll register a click.

184
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:54,325
Speaker 7:  I'm gonna do this

185
00:10:54,745 --> 00:10:57,405
Speaker 5:  Tot you so much when I see you, I can't wait

186
00:10:57,405 --> 00:11:00,285
Speaker 2:  To do this assuming that I'm wearing the headset. What a good prank. It's

187
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:03,085
Speaker 2:  a good prank. So you screw people like the, when I say the thing is lonely,

188
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:07,445
Speaker 2:  it does not contemplate anyone else being around you who is not on their

189
00:11:07,445 --> 00:11:11,045
Speaker 2:  best behavior. Which is all the time all other people are not on their best

190
00:11:11,165 --> 00:11:11,205
Speaker 2:  behavior.

191
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:14,605
Speaker 7:  Is it just assuming that like the pass through will suddenly pop on and you'll

192
00:11:14,605 --> 00:11:16,045
Speaker 7:  see David being like Yew,

193
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:19,565
Speaker 7:  I assume that's the noise David's gonna make.

194
00:11:19,705 --> 00:11:21,085
Speaker 5:  That's what I do when I type. Yeah.

195
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:24,565
Speaker 2:  The only AR features in it specifically it recognizes

196
00:11:24,565 --> 00:11:28,365
Speaker 2:  David Peterson makes that sound So I.

197
00:11:28,445 --> 00:11:30,365
Speaker 2:  Anyway, I thought this was all really interesting feedback 'cause people

198
00:11:30,365 --> 00:11:33,565
Speaker 2:  who have been working on this stuff for a long time were like, we like to

199
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:37,285
Speaker 2:  review, here are the things we think you got right, right and wrong. And

200
00:11:37,545 --> 00:11:41,085
Speaker 2:  the camera based pass through as a replacement for

201
00:11:41,425 --> 00:11:44,725
Speaker 2:  true AR feels directionally correct to me. Right.

202
00:11:45,265 --> 00:11:49,205
Speaker 2:  This it might be the ceiling for that eye tracking. They're like

203
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:51,125
Speaker 2:  yeah, you know, people are gonna react to it differently. We'll see this

204
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:54,255
Speaker 2:  is the first big eye tracking at scale that will

205
00:11:54,995 --> 00:11:58,135
Speaker 2:  happen. And then they're like, you're just wrong in hand tracking. So we'll

206
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:01,455
Speaker 2:  see. I the fact that like it just mis registers input to me

207
00:12:01,905 --> 00:12:05,095
Speaker 2:  is again, people are gonna, by the time you are listening to this, people

208
00:12:05,095 --> 00:12:08,775
Speaker 2:  will have them. By the way, I, Justine has already worn a Vision Pro on a

209
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:09,695
Speaker 2:  cyber truck just

210
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:13,575
Speaker 7:  Immediately. Yes. Like as soon as the embargo lifted she was walking

211
00:12:13,575 --> 00:12:15,895
Speaker 2:  Out the truck and she's, I mean she's funny as hell. So like I appreciate

212
00:12:15,895 --> 00:12:19,055
Speaker 2:  that she did that. Yeah. But like some other kind of YouTuber, not I, Justine

213
00:12:19,075 --> 00:12:22,935
Speaker 2:  who is wonderful, some other kind of YouTuber is gonna do the actual thing

214
00:12:22,935 --> 00:12:26,335
Speaker 2:  with the cyber truck and the Vision Pro and with the clock is just ticking

215
00:12:26,635 --> 00:12:28,055
Speaker 7:  Unsafe. Don't do that. Don't

216
00:12:28,055 --> 00:12:28,535
Speaker 5:  Don't do it.

217
00:12:28,535 --> 00:12:31,495
Speaker 2:  They're not gonna listen to us. They're doing it for the views man. Don't

218
00:12:31,495 --> 00:12:32,935
Speaker 7:  Do it for the clicks. Do something else. Cool.

219
00:12:33,315 --> 00:12:35,735
Speaker 2:  Do the, so we'll see. I'm excited for people to actually get their hands

220
00:12:35,735 --> 00:12:39,055
Speaker 2:  on this outside of just experiencing other people's experiences

221
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:44,015
Speaker 2:  and I'm, I'm very curious to see how people react to hand and eye tracking

222
00:12:44,015 --> 00:12:44,575
Speaker 2:  in particular.

223
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:48,935
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Also, if you got one as you're hearing this on Friday

224
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:52,855
Speaker 5:  the second, it's the day this stuff is coming out. If you got one, call us

225
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:56,255
Speaker 5:  and tell us about it. We'll this will be a super fun thing to do on the hotline

226
00:12:56,255 --> 00:12:59,095
Speaker 5:  for the next few weeks. I just wanna hear people's experiences. Yeah. With

227
00:12:59,095 --> 00:13:01,855
Speaker 5:  the Vision Pro. Tell us what you're doing. Tell us what's cool. Tell us what

228
00:13:01,855 --> 00:13:05,735
Speaker 5:  sucks. Give us, give us your like 62nd review of the Vision Pro.

229
00:13:05,805 --> 00:13:09,015
Speaker 5:  Literally whenever you want. Call the hotline. Send us emails. Yeah.

230
00:13:09,615 --> 00:13:10,575
Speaker 5:  Vergecast at The Verge dot com.

231
00:13:10,715 --> 00:13:13,095
Speaker 2:  I'm dying to know. You can tell me, tell I'm, tell me I'm wrong. Whatever

232
00:13:13,095 --> 00:13:16,175
Speaker 2:  you want. I I'm dying to know how you feel about this product 'cause it is

233
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:20,095
Speaker 2:  new and that's what's exciting about it, which leads me into the score. So

234
00:13:20,135 --> 00:13:23,975
Speaker 2:  a lot of people have asked me about the score and I will tell you, and David

235
00:13:24,155 --> 00:13:28,095
Speaker 2:  in particular will tell you that I drove myself crazy

236
00:13:28,195 --> 00:13:31,335
Speaker 2:  trying to give this thing a score after I'd written the review. Yes. Confirmed

237
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:35,015
Speaker 2:  bonkers. Like, 'cause I'm the one who says World of no sevens

238
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:40,275
Speaker 2:  and I gave it a seven. It's like, oops. So if You don't know World of

239
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:44,035
Speaker 2:  no sevens, the thing I say all the time, which is you seven is just the

240
00:13:44,275 --> 00:13:48,115
Speaker 2:  default score. It is milk toast. And so if you say world of oh

241
00:13:48,115 --> 00:13:51,355
Speaker 2:  sevens, it forces you to make a very hard choice between six and eight.

242
00:13:52,805 --> 00:13:55,505
Speaker 2:  And I am the person who says this and I definitely gave this thing a seven

243
00:13:56,725 --> 00:13:59,225
Speaker 2:  and I tortured myself over that seven. And

244
00:13:59,225 --> 00:13:59,705
Speaker 5:  You got it wrong.

245
00:14:00,045 --> 00:14:01,985
Speaker 2:  And David thinks I should have given it. You got it

246
00:14:01,985 --> 00:14:05,505
Speaker 7:  Wrong. I, I tend to agree with, I was genuinely shocked 'cause I, I didn't

247
00:14:05,505 --> 00:14:08,785
Speaker 7:  participate in the review, but, but we, you know, we did The Vergecast and

248
00:14:08,785 --> 00:14:12,265
Speaker 7:  So. I went as soon as it posted and I click and I scrolled down and I saw,

249
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:16,345
Speaker 7:  saw that seven and I was like, but we, it felt like a six in The Vergecast

250
00:14:16,345 --> 00:14:18,025
Speaker 7:  that we recorded. This is interesting.

251
00:14:18,535 --> 00:14:22,265
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And I sat on The Vergecast and I have to own this. Yeah. Inconsistent

252
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:26,105
Speaker 2:  input system is a full point deduction. And at that moment in time, and I,

253
00:14:26,255 --> 00:14:29,945
Speaker 2:  this is a hundred percent true, the score that was

254
00:14:29,945 --> 00:14:33,705
Speaker 2:  entered into our little score database was a six. Oh mm. What? And I

255
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:36,865
Speaker 2:  said that knowing that I'd already typed the six into that database, what

256
00:14:36,865 --> 00:14:38,745
Speaker 7:  Pushed you back up to a seven? I

257
00:14:38,765 --> 00:14:42,705
Speaker 2:  Had a conversation with Verin and Becca in particular. Becca

258
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:47,065
Speaker 2:  are wonderful video directors who u made this whole review with me and

259
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:50,905
Speaker 2:  used it a lot in the course of that review. And they

260
00:14:51,285 --> 00:14:52,805
Speaker 2:  reminded me that it was really fun.

261
00:14:54,265 --> 00:14:58,165
Speaker 7:  So so it lost a point for inconsistency. Gained a point because

262
00:14:58,195 --> 00:14:58,885
Speaker 7:  it's fun as hell.

263
00:14:59,025 --> 00:15:02,965
Speaker 2:  It lost a point for Incon. Vien was we, we were re we were like, we were

264
00:15:02,965 --> 00:15:06,205
Speaker 2:  in it. We were like, we opened up our own how we rate page and like read

265
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:10,165
Speaker 2:  our own definitions of the numbers. Like you're in and office

266
00:15:10,165 --> 00:15:13,085
Speaker 2:  with people for hours upon hours arguing with the dumbest. Like you just

267
00:15:13,085 --> 00:15:16,765
Speaker 2:  like fall down the rabbit hole completely. We discussed bringing back

268
00:15:16,765 --> 00:15:19,685
Speaker 2:  decimals, which we had got rid of a couple years, like the whole thing.

269
00:15:21,585 --> 00:15:21,805
Speaker 2:  And

270
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:27,595
Speaker 2:  Vern's line was we need a, we need a number that means fantastic but useless

271
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:31,935
Speaker 2:  'cause that he's like, this is fantastic. I have no idea why I wanna use

272
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:32,015
Speaker 2:  this.

273
00:15:32,045 --> 00:15:35,255
Speaker 5:  What about the number that says it's $3,500?

274
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:40,215
Speaker 5:  Do you know how many you want fun buying a Nintendo Switch and you'll have

275
00:15:40,215 --> 00:15:43,615
Speaker 5:  $3,200 left. Isn't that cool?

276
00:15:44,355 --> 00:15:48,095
Speaker 2:  So look, like I say I was at six for a long time. Yeah. It was a six.

277
00:15:48,255 --> 00:15:52,215
Speaker 2:  I I swear to you it was a six and Becky was like, but you have

278
00:15:52,235 --> 00:15:56,095
Speaker 2:  had like the thing you are doing the, you were constantly talking

279
00:15:56,095 --> 00:15:59,295
Speaker 2:  about this thing that you keep coming back to like I'm lonely in here is

280
00:15:59,415 --> 00:16:01,535
Speaker 2:  'cause you're having fun and you want other people to have fun with you.

281
00:16:01,745 --> 00:16:05,455
Speaker 2:  Which is not how I feel about the Meta quest, which is like, this is fun.

282
00:16:05,685 --> 00:16:08,855
Speaker 2:  Like, nah, I'm swinging a bat around like there's not a point where I'm look

283
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:12,815
Speaker 2:  at this thing that you is wild that I want you to see. Like the

284
00:16:12,815 --> 00:16:16,455
Speaker 2:  art gallery of webpages that I made in our cafe. I was like, this is cra

285
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:19,215
Speaker 2:  like nothing else can do that right now. The me Quest can sort of do it,

286
00:16:19,715 --> 00:16:22,775
Speaker 2:  but they're kind of shaped like this is like perfectly locked in place windows

287
00:16:22,795 --> 00:16:26,735
Speaker 2:  and you can just leave the room and come back. That's your point is it was

288
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:30,615
Speaker 2:  fun. It was a full point deduction for the stuff I complained about and

289
00:16:30,635 --> 00:16:33,735
Speaker 2:  it it earned its way back into the seven zone.

290
00:16:34,735 --> 00:16:35,935
Speaker 2:  'cause it's not an eight. Yeah.

291
00:16:35,955 --> 00:16:37,615
Speaker 7:  Oh yeah. I was gonna say it was never an

292
00:16:37,615 --> 00:16:39,855
Speaker 2:  Eight. It was, there was no point. Was this thing getting an eight?

293
00:16:40,435 --> 00:16:41,255
Speaker 7:  Did it ever go to five

294
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:45,175
Speaker 2:  So I was texting with Dan Sert. Yes. Wonderful reviews that are number one

295
00:16:45,195 --> 00:16:48,495
Speaker 2:  Dex fan in the world. Dan Sert traitor. Dan just left The Verge. So he was

296
00:16:48,495 --> 00:16:51,615
Speaker 2:  not part of this review. We wish him well on his new journey in life. It's

297
00:16:51,615 --> 00:16:55,415
Speaker 2:  gonna be really fun for him. But Dan texted me after the review and was like,

298
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:59,335
Speaker 2:  seven, huh. And I was like, dude. And like

299
00:16:59,335 --> 00:17:03,215
Speaker 2:  literally people were jumping out of the woodwork to quote Dan at me

300
00:17:03,215 --> 00:17:06,935
Speaker 2:  throughout this process because Dan's quote is, you never regret giving

301
00:17:06,935 --> 00:17:10,425
Speaker 2:  something a lower score ever. Like if you just

302
00:17:10,705 --> 00:17:13,305
Speaker 2:  instinctively pick the lower score and you won't won't, it's five years from

303
00:17:13,305 --> 00:17:15,825
Speaker 2:  now you won't have regretted it. You might be like, ah, I gave that stupid

304
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:18,305
Speaker 2:  thing in eight. Why'd I do that? Yeah, but you'll never be like, I judge

305
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:22,065
Speaker 2:  it too harshly. Like literally I'm like walking down the street and people

306
00:17:22,065 --> 00:17:24,945
Speaker 2:  are like, you know what Dan would say? He's like haunting me.

307
00:17:25,165 --> 00:17:28,345
Speaker 5:  And I will say that's not, that's not a like judgment

308
00:17:29,145 --> 00:17:32,545
Speaker 5:  decision. That's not saying like we reflexively hate products. That is like

309
00:17:32,705 --> 00:17:36,585
Speaker 5:  a decade of hard worn experience. Yeah. And this is the mistake that you

310
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:40,505
Speaker 5:  made NELI is you got sucked in by the thing being fun. Like

311
00:17:40,505 --> 00:17:44,345
Speaker 5:  that's a stupid reason. It's just a stupid reason.

312
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:48,225
Speaker 5:  Like this is a $3,500 computer. You don't judge your MacBook

313
00:17:48,225 --> 00:17:51,965
Speaker 5:  on whether it's fun. You judge it on whether it does the things it is

314
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:56,165
Speaker 5:  supposed to do. And this fundamentally doesn't it? Yeah.

315
00:17:56,165 --> 00:17:59,245
Speaker 5:  There are a lot of things that it is supposed to do that it either doesn't

316
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:03,165
Speaker 5:  do or doesn't do very well and it is $3,500.

317
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:04,005
Speaker 5:  Like

318
00:18:04,075 --> 00:18:07,685
Speaker 2:  Look, I take the criticism and I, I look, I knew

319
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:11,485
Speaker 2:  what I was buying. I was buying a bunch of people telling me that I did give

320
00:18:11,485 --> 00:18:15,285
Speaker 2:  in a high score, including David on this very podcast. I knew how this

321
00:18:15,405 --> 00:18:17,685
Speaker 2:  Vergecast would start today when I gave it that seven. You did.

322
00:18:17,685 --> 00:18:20,085
Speaker 5:  But wait, I just, I just wanna point at the tension of this, which I think

323
00:18:20,085 --> 00:18:23,445
Speaker 5:  is both the tension you felt in reviewing this. And the reason we all think

324
00:18:23,445 --> 00:18:27,085
Speaker 5:  the Vision Pro is so interesting is that it is objectively

325
00:18:27,595 --> 00:18:30,925
Speaker 5:  cool and new and interesting, right? Like the Joanna Stern, our friend of

326
00:18:30,925 --> 00:18:33,885
Speaker 5:  the Wall Street Journal made a video and there's a moment in it where she

327
00:18:33,885 --> 00:18:37,605
Speaker 5:  sets two timers and puts them over two different things on her stove.

328
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:41,845
Speaker 5:  Like that kicks ass. It's so small and so silly, but

329
00:18:41,845 --> 00:18:45,805
Speaker 5:  it's so cool and people really responded to it. That is not a reason to buy

330
00:18:45,845 --> 00:18:49,605
Speaker 5:  a $3,500 product or to wear a headset on your face all day. but it

331
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,885
Speaker 5:  is. Which she said, right. but it is cool. It is

332
00:18:53,095 --> 00:18:56,605
Speaker 5:  undeniably cool. The shortcuts thing you were talking about is like undeniably

333
00:18:56,605 --> 00:18:59,685
Speaker 5:  cool and I wanna live in a world where that is part of my life. I will not

334
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:02,525
Speaker 5:  wear the headset and I will not buy the headset in order to get that thing.

335
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:06,205
Speaker 5:  But like that's that tension, right, where you have these moments where you're

336
00:19:06,205 --> 00:19:09,445
Speaker 5:  like, oh this is it. Like they, they did it, this is it. And then you have

337
00:19:09,445 --> 00:19:13,325
Speaker 5:  to weigh that against what is this thing I have on my face? What does

338
00:19:13,325 --> 00:19:17,165
Speaker 5:  that mean for like my life? Is this worth the cost? And you even said in

339
00:19:17,165 --> 00:19:20,925
Speaker 5:  the review, right? We, we review things not just based on like what they

340
00:19:21,205 --> 00:19:25,125
Speaker 5:  might be someday, but what the thing is in the box. But that is so

341
00:19:25,185 --> 00:19:25,405
Speaker 5:  but

342
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:29,245
Speaker 2:  But that's not, that's not what got it to seven. I I that's my rule.

343
00:19:29,595 --> 00:19:29,885
Speaker 2:  It's

344
00:19:29,885 --> 00:19:33,165
Speaker 5:  A good rule. It's the right rule, but it's, it's so hard to do, especially

345
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:37,245
Speaker 5:  in this case because a apple has a longer history of being

346
00:19:37,295 --> 00:19:41,125
Speaker 5:  right about these things than most. So like most of the time you

347
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:44,525
Speaker 5:  genuinely should not assume this thing will ever get better for any reason.

348
00:19:44,525 --> 00:19:48,365
Speaker 5:  Because most of the time it doesn't with Apple it usually does. Yeah. And

349
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:51,885
Speaker 5:  so you have to believe that more than with most companies. But then also

350
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:54,135
Speaker 5:  it's 3,500.

351
00:19:54,885 --> 00:19:58,855
Speaker 2:  Okay, so here's how I've that price thing also wait on

352
00:19:58,855 --> 00:20:02,815
Speaker 2:  my mind. Another good argument for six, if it's a phone review

353
00:20:02,815 --> 00:20:06,135
Speaker 2:  and even in in phone reviews now it's like you're just reviewing iPhones

354
00:20:06,135 --> 00:20:10,055
Speaker 2:  for people who buy iPhones. You're very rarely writing a review for

355
00:20:10,215 --> 00:20:12,935
Speaker 2:  somebody with an Android phone. Totally. Except for like blunt curiosity.

356
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:13,775
Speaker 2:  If the camera's good or bad,

357
00:20:15,855 --> 00:20:19,275
Speaker 2:  my assumption going into this was that I was not writing buying advice. The

358
00:20:19,275 --> 00:20:21,355
Speaker 2:  people who are buying the Vision Pro are buying the vision pro whether or

359
00:20:21,355 --> 00:20:24,195
Speaker 2:  not I think it's good or bad. So what was that score speaking? So the score

360
00:20:24,215 --> 00:20:28,155
Speaker 2:  was like, okay, like however many they sold 80,000, 120,000.

361
00:20:29,155 --> 00:20:31,735
Speaker 2:  The vast majority of people are gonna try this thing on. And my guess is

362
00:20:31,735 --> 00:20:34,335
Speaker 2:  after a while they're like, yeah it's seven and like that is where that came

363
00:20:34,335 --> 00:20:37,975
Speaker 2:  from, right? Is eh, it kind of works a all the time. But oh man,

364
00:20:37,975 --> 00:20:41,575
Speaker 2:  Sometimes I have really good time Like that, that exact thing. The reason

365
00:20:41,605 --> 00:20:45,575
Speaker 2:  it's world of no sevens is the that is why I got there.

366
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:49,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Because sometimes you're like, oh this is great. And then sometimes

367
00:20:49,205 --> 00:20:53,085
Speaker 2:  you're like, I'm looking at the look at the right and

368
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,925
Speaker 2:  like that is like a okay but real challenge in there. 10

369
00:20:56,975 --> 00:20:59,445
Speaker 2:  years from now, it's not broken. The last Apple product I gave a six to was

370
00:20:59,445 --> 00:21:03,405
Speaker 2:  the Apple Studio display whose webcam basically shipped an unusable

371
00:21:03,405 --> 00:21:06,645
Speaker 2:  state. Right. And I was like, this is six. 'cause this display technology,

372
00:21:06,705 --> 00:21:10,525
Speaker 2:  the panel is fine, but the backlight technology is steam powered

373
00:21:10,705 --> 00:21:14,445
Speaker 2:  and this camera's effectively broken six. And that was what,

374
00:21:14,445 --> 00:21:15,885
Speaker 2:  $1,200? $1,300.

375
00:21:16,115 --> 00:21:17,085
Speaker 5:  $1,600.

376
00:21:17,435 --> 00:21:19,125
Speaker 2:  1600. I should have given that a

377
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,245
Speaker 5:  Five. Yeah, you should have That's what I was about to say. You scored that

378
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:21,805
Speaker 5:  thing too high.

379
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:24,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah. All right. Maybe I'm just wrong, but

380
00:21:24,685 --> 00:21:28,365
Speaker 5:  I will say a bunch of people pointed out the similarities between what

381
00:21:28,395 --> 00:21:32,325
Speaker 5:  this thing is and what the original Apple Watch was, which I think

382
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:35,725
Speaker 5:  is really interesting because you gave both a seven and I think you were

383
00:21:35,725 --> 00:21:37,645
Speaker 5:  right about the Apple Watch and wrong about this. And I've been trying to

384
00:21:37,645 --> 00:21:39,845
Speaker 5:  figure out what it is. Interesting. I know what it is.

385
00:21:39,955 --> 00:21:41,685
Speaker 2:  Wait, wait, I wanna hear what David series. I

386
00:21:41,685 --> 00:21:44,565
Speaker 5:  Have two theories. One for it is $3,500

387
00:21:46,065 --> 00:21:50,005
Speaker 5:  and the other is, I think the first Apple Watch got

388
00:21:50,025 --> 00:21:53,965
Speaker 5:  the form factor almost right. And hadn't quite figured

389
00:21:53,985 --> 00:21:57,925
Speaker 5:  out the use case, but it was like still a nice thing to where I got furious

390
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,165
Speaker 5:  at the first Apple watch because it didn't tell the time. Yeah. The screen

391
00:22:01,325 --> 00:22:04,205
Speaker 5:  wasn't on all the time. Like how dare you a watch if you don't tell me the

392
00:22:04,205 --> 00:22:07,925
Speaker 5:  time when I look at you. but it it like the, the

393
00:22:07,925 --> 00:22:11,445
Speaker 5:  thing was there, right? It was close enough to being what the thing should

394
00:22:11,445 --> 00:22:14,365
Speaker 5:  be and it already did some of the things you would want it to. So it was

395
00:22:14,365 --> 00:22:18,325
Speaker 5:  like, that felt closer to me than this in which the thing

396
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:21,845
Speaker 5:  itself is nowhere near what it's supposed to be. Nope. Not even close. And

397
00:22:21,845 --> 00:22:25,805
Speaker 5:  so that's where it loses me. Like I deduct a full 0.4. Absolutely

398
00:22:25,805 --> 00:22:27,525
Speaker 5:  no one thinks this is what this is supposed to look

399
00:22:27,525 --> 00:22:31,085
Speaker 2:  Like. Yeah. I will say I feel very vindicated by the modern

400
00:22:31,445 --> 00:22:34,485
Speaker 2:  rereading of the Apple Watch reviews. I got raked over the Kohls for giving

401
00:22:34,485 --> 00:22:35,765
Speaker 2:  that thing a bad score. Yeah, it holds

402
00:22:35,765 --> 00:22:36,325
Speaker 5:  Up. It really does.

403
00:22:36,545 --> 00:22:40,245
Speaker 2:  And I was like, this thing is a, I believe I used the word bobble. I was

404
00:22:40,245 --> 00:22:43,765
Speaker 2:  like, this thing is a bobble and you will buy it if you, and if you buy it,

405
00:22:43,985 --> 00:22:47,885
Speaker 2:  you will like it because people like Bobs, but it is not fashion.

406
00:22:48,385 --> 00:22:51,205
Speaker 2:  It is technology that looks like fashion and they need to figure out what

407
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:55,005
Speaker 2:  it's for. And it took them three generations to get there and they

408
00:22:55,005 --> 00:22:58,605
Speaker 2:  totally rebooted the software. And I was like, no one will ever. And like

409
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:01,165
Speaker 2:  for a long time people were like, you were just unnecessarily harsh. And

410
00:23:01,165 --> 00:23:05,085
Speaker 2:  this time like literally our screenshots comparing my two reviews

411
00:23:05,615 --> 00:23:09,365
Speaker 2:  being like, oh, this is the same exact thing and the only thing I will

412
00:23:09,365 --> 00:23:12,965
Speaker 2:  remind everyone of is one, I was right. I'll always remind you that. No,

413
00:23:12,965 --> 00:23:13,245
Speaker 2:  but two,

414
00:23:15,065 --> 00:23:18,525
Speaker 2:  the, the path wasn't set when the thing was launched.

415
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:23,285
Speaker 2:  Right. So being like this thing happened to the Apple watch means it will

416
00:23:23,285 --> 00:23:26,835
Speaker 2:  happen to the other thing they had to adjust.

417
00:23:27,085 --> 00:23:30,875
Speaker 2:  Right. And actually the review is like, it adjusts them.

418
00:23:30,985 --> 00:23:33,835
Speaker 2:  Like they take the feedback from the market, from the customers, from the

419
00:23:33,835 --> 00:23:37,795
Speaker 2:  reviewers and they like make decisions based on it. And one of

420
00:23:37,795 --> 00:23:41,635
Speaker 2:  the big decisions they had to make along the way was we are totally rebooting

421
00:23:41,665 --> 00:23:44,875
Speaker 2:  watchOS to make the interface different, to completely

422
00:23:45,845 --> 00:23:49,325
Speaker 2:  decrease our reliance on third party apps in an app store.

423
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,845
Speaker 7:  You're just telling me your watch review should have been a six,

424
00:23:53,585 --> 00:23:56,845
Speaker 5:  But also Apple with the Apple watch. And this is true of a lot of Apple things,

425
00:23:56,845 --> 00:23:59,365
Speaker 5:  right? Apple starts by getting the hardware pretty close to Right.

426
00:24:00,345 --> 00:24:00,605
Speaker 7:  I'm gonna,

427
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,725
Speaker 5:  The software away it's

428
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,245
Speaker 2:  Alex will be joining Dan Seavert in the world Beyond.

429
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:10,405
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Can we just re-review every Apple product we've ever done right now

430
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:11,845
Speaker 5:  Let's just rescore them all. I

431
00:24:11,955 --> 00:24:12,965
Speaker 2:  Have a lot. Yeah, go ahead.

432
00:24:13,025 --> 00:24:16,525
Speaker 5:  The the watch hardware was very close and then the question is how do we

433
00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:20,365
Speaker 5:  make this thing into what it ought to be inside of

434
00:24:20,365 --> 00:24:23,325
Speaker 5:  this box? And Apple. Apple usually gets the box, right? In this case neither

435
00:24:23,345 --> 00:24:24,565
Speaker 5:  one of them is right? Yeah.

436
00:24:24,675 --> 00:24:28,485
Speaker 7:  Well it like the watch shipped to people and they could use it

437
00:24:28,485 --> 00:24:32,165
Speaker 7:  and they could set it up and they didn't have issues with it and lots of

438
00:24:32,165 --> 00:24:32,805
Speaker 7:  people bought one

439
00:24:32,915 --> 00:24:36,805
Speaker 2:  Wait, famously Carl Lagerfeld could not set his up and really she does not.

440
00:24:36,805 --> 00:24:39,965
Speaker 2:  Do you not know about this? This is like an old ette joke. Carl Lagerfeld

441
00:24:39,965 --> 00:24:42,365
Speaker 2:  was photographed, you know, they gave it to all the fashion people beginning.

442
00:24:42,365 --> 00:24:46,245
Speaker 2:  Yeah. They photographed Carl Lagerfeld wearing proudly wearing it with the

443
00:24:46,245 --> 00:24:47,205
Speaker 2:  setup screen on the face.

444
00:24:49,305 --> 00:24:52,205
Speaker 2:  And that's like we call, we started calling it Lagerfeld where you're just

445
00:24:52,205 --> 00:24:55,965
Speaker 2:  like wearing a dead Apple watch just as a, as a fashion accessory. That's

446
00:24:55,965 --> 00:24:56,205
Speaker 2:  awesome. but

447
00:24:56,205 --> 00:24:56,325
Speaker 5:  It

448
00:24:56,375 --> 00:25:00,045
Speaker 7:  Again, that was another reason to give it a seven because it was like a fashion

449
00:25:00,045 --> 00:25:04,005
Speaker 7:  thing. Not necessarily a good one, but it was fashion. And this is just like

450
00:25:04,475 --> 00:25:08,325
Speaker 7:  such a developer kit. Yeah. That I keep m like I keep thinking about

451
00:25:08,325 --> 00:25:10,845
Speaker 7:  that a lot. Like it feels like such a developer kit.

452
00:25:11,235 --> 00:25:14,365
Speaker 2:  They, they just won't say it man. There was a story in Vanity Fair, a

453
00:25:14,365 --> 00:25:16,365
Speaker 7:  Beautifully photographed story in Vanity

454
00:25:16,365 --> 00:25:16,885
Speaker 5:  Fair. It was

455
00:25:17,765 --> 00:25:17,885
Speaker 7:  Stunning.

456
00:25:18,605 --> 00:25:22,325
Speaker 2:  A photograph story in Vanity Fair. Tim Cook is wearing the headset.

457
00:25:22,635 --> 00:25:24,565
Speaker 5:  He's blinking. Yeah. Did you notice this? His

458
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:25,085
Speaker 2:  Eyes are closed.

459
00:25:25,425 --> 00:25:28,965
Speaker 5:  His googly eyes on the front of the headset are closed. He's blinking in

460
00:25:28,965 --> 00:25:29,245
Speaker 5:  the photo.

461
00:25:29,665 --> 00:25:30,365
Speaker 2:  That's very funny.

462
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:31,405
Speaker 5:  It's fantastic. They

463
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:35,085
Speaker 2:  Should put that on the website. Anyhow, there's a story in

464
00:25:35,085 --> 00:25:38,965
Speaker 2:  Vanity Fair and it is, I mean honestly a story could be from 10 years

465
00:25:38,965 --> 00:25:42,645
Speaker 2:  ago. I know Nick Bilton who wrote it. Nick is a very nice guy. I've had a

466
00:25:42,645 --> 00:25:45,045
Speaker 2:  taco at a party at his house before. Like he's a very nice guy,

467
00:25:46,465 --> 00:25:50,045
Speaker 2:  but it could have been written 10 years ago about vr. Right, right. Like

468
00:25:50,065 --> 00:25:52,845
Speaker 2:  the line is like Tim Cook saw himself on on the moon. He knew it was the

469
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:56,525
Speaker 2:  future. Like that line has been written about Mark Zuckerberg

470
00:25:56,705 --> 00:25:57,685
Speaker 2:  and Palmer. Like

471
00:25:57,875 --> 00:26:01,685
Speaker 7:  Yeah you could have just like done find and replace Magic

472
00:26:01,795 --> 00:26:04,125
Speaker 7:  Leap for every time they say Vision Pro at that review.

473
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:07,965
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Do you remember a Magic Leap? Was it Wired that ran the story

474
00:26:07,965 --> 00:26:11,285
Speaker 2:  where Yes. Ronney Ovitz was like, I'm hacking the GPU of your brain. Yep.

475
00:26:12,035 --> 00:26:14,725
Speaker 2:  Like we've just been here man. Like

476
00:26:16,025 --> 00:26:19,245
Speaker 2:  and So I think Apple can't say it's a developer kit. They can't

477
00:26:19,895 --> 00:26:23,805
Speaker 2:  place themself in the long line of companies that have

478
00:26:23,805 --> 00:26:27,085
Speaker 2:  been doing this for a long. They have to say it's finished. Which is why

479
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:31,045
Speaker 2:  they have to, they have to have entertainment and they have

480
00:26:31,045 --> 00:26:34,525
Speaker 2:  to do this. James Cameron is in that Manny fair piece quoted as

481
00:26:34,755 --> 00:26:37,965
Speaker 2:  saying this will change everything. And it's like, dude, you have done more

482
00:26:37,965 --> 00:26:39,005
Speaker 2:  scuba diving VR than anybody.

483
00:26:39,445 --> 00:26:42,485
Speaker 7:  I have been thinking about that quote specifically more than anything else

484
00:26:42,505 --> 00:26:46,485
Speaker 7:  that's come out of this whole situation. Yeah, because James Cameron is

485
00:26:47,025 --> 00:26:50,805
Speaker 7:  like, not generally a guy. I was gonna say he's not generally a

486
00:26:50,805 --> 00:26:53,485
Speaker 7:  guy prone to hyperbole, but he did once declare himself king of the world.

487
00:26:54,505 --> 00:26:56,165
Speaker 5:  Don don't know if that was hyperbole at some point,

488
00:26:57,145 --> 00:26:58,445
Speaker 2:  At that moment in time. Yeah.

489
00:26:58,545 --> 00:27:01,965
Speaker 7:  But when it comes to like technology, he's not usually a guy prone to hyperbole.

490
00:27:01,965 --> 00:27:05,045
Speaker 7:  And so when he's like, no, this changes everything and he's specifically

491
00:27:05,045 --> 00:27:08,285
Speaker 7:  talking about the display technology. Yeah. Like, which sounds really, really

492
00:27:08,285 --> 00:27:12,085
Speaker 7:  incredible. I was like, is there something there? Like have we missed

493
00:27:12,085 --> 00:27:15,845
Speaker 7:  something that James Cameron is seeing and that we're not besides like

494
00:27:15,845 --> 00:27:16,485
Speaker 7:  the inside of the headset?

495
00:27:16,985 --> 00:27:20,405
Speaker 2:  It is legitimately amazing display technology. I I have nothing but admiration

496
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:23,925
Speaker 2:  for how hard it was to build those displays. They are genuinely amazing.

497
00:27:23,955 --> 00:27:27,085
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Right. They are available apparently on the market. The same person

498
00:27:27,085 --> 00:27:30,245
Speaker 2:  who told me hand tracking being something they believed in was like, you

499
00:27:30,245 --> 00:27:32,885
Speaker 2:  know, Meta could have bought those. Like they, that was a thing that Meta

500
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:36,285
Speaker 2:  had the opportunity to buy. But Meta is a version of headset would've been

501
00:27:36,285 --> 00:27:40,245
Speaker 2:  even more expensive because Meta doesn't have

502
00:27:40,845 --> 00:27:44,445
Speaker 2:  M1 chips or M two chips. They would've had to go and buy chips with more

503
00:27:44,445 --> 00:27:47,525
Speaker 2:  power and more battery and they're like, this is, we can't go this way. Right.

504
00:27:47,785 --> 00:27:51,005
Speaker 2:  So Apple uniquely was able to make use of these displays,

505
00:27:51,695 --> 00:27:55,445
Speaker 2:  which are again an engineering marvel. But like

506
00:27:55,455 --> 00:27:59,445
Speaker 2:  James, they're just better than what you have now. Right.

507
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:03,005
Speaker 2:  They're just like linearly better than the thing you have now. Yeah. And

508
00:28:03,005 --> 00:28:06,965
Speaker 2:  that if you're James Cameron, like you should be able to see like,

509
00:28:07,115 --> 00:28:09,805
Speaker 2:  yeah, this is the step. Like this is the step change that changes at all

510
00:28:09,805 --> 00:28:10,325
Speaker 2:  is like not the thing.

511
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:13,325
Speaker 7:  I really wanna like sit him down and be like, did they just like cherry pick

512
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:14,005
Speaker 7:  your quotes here.

513
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:16,325
Speaker 2:  They run Apple TV plus man. I know. Like

514
00:28:16,365 --> 00:28:20,045
Speaker 7:  I need, I just need to know more from Jim. Jim call me. I know you listen

515
00:28:20,045 --> 00:28:21,165
Speaker 7:  to Vergecast. He does.

516
00:28:21,315 --> 00:28:21,605
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

517
00:28:22,255 --> 00:28:23,845
Speaker 7:  We'll talk about the the sub too. Jim

518
00:28:23,845 --> 00:28:27,525
Speaker 2:  Was a guy who told me about Meta. He's the source. If you're listening Tim

519
00:28:27,525 --> 00:28:30,205
Speaker 2:  Cook. That's not true at all. Not, not even like the slightest picture.

520
00:28:32,205 --> 00:28:34,685
Speaker 2:  A little bit. It's, it's, by the time you're listening to this, it is will

521
00:28:34,685 --> 00:28:37,245
Speaker 2:  be out. I'm sure some of you are driving. Your car is wearing it right now.

522
00:28:37,245 --> 00:28:38,605
Speaker 2:  Stop it. Pull over to the side of the road.

523
00:28:40,175 --> 00:28:44,005
Speaker 2:  Apple today. A little bit more Apple announced along with the

524
00:28:44,005 --> 00:28:47,805
Speaker 2:  launch division Pro 600 apps will be at

525
00:28:47,805 --> 00:28:50,395
Speaker 2:  launch. Which seems like a good number.

526
00:28:51,145 --> 00:28:51,555
Speaker 7:  It's a lot

527
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:55,715
Speaker 2:  For, for a new platform. It's a good number. Is it? I think So

528
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,915
Speaker 5:  I mean it's fine. It's some apps. But like this is the company that spends

529
00:28:59,915 --> 00:29:03,395
Speaker 5:  a lot of time talking about hundreds of thousands of apps and millions of

530
00:29:03,395 --> 00:29:05,515
Speaker 5:  apps. 600 is is

531
00:29:05,865 --> 00:29:09,515
Speaker 7:  Good. I'm gonna point out, I once got really roasted for being, for

532
00:29:09,755 --> 00:29:13,075
Speaker 7:  complaining about how few games launched with a Nintendo Switch.

533
00:29:14,225 --> 00:29:17,195
Speaker 7:  Granted I did say it when Zelda came out and it was one of the best games

534
00:29:17,195 --> 00:29:17,675
Speaker 7:  ever made.

535
00:29:18,015 --> 00:29:20,355
Speaker 2:  But like, here's the 600 apps. I don Six

536
00:29:20,355 --> 00:29:20,675
Speaker 7:  Hundred's.

537
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:21,915
Speaker 2:  Impressive 600 is great.

538
00:29:22,015 --> 00:29:25,875
Speaker 5:  600 is Vision Pro, like built for spatial computing.

539
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:27,355
Speaker 5:  It's also gonna have all the iPad stuff. Yeah.

540
00:29:27,355 --> 00:29:31,155
Speaker 2:  1 million apps. 600 Vision Pro apps. Sure. Which I will

541
00:29:31,165 --> 00:29:35,115
Speaker 2:  just point out is

542
00:29:36,255 --> 00:29:38,635
Speaker 2:  999,900 600. 999,400.

543
00:29:38,785 --> 00:29:39,235
Speaker 5:  400.

544
00:29:39,505 --> 00:29:42,565
Speaker 2:  400. Yeah. No, that's a a hundred. That's a million. Yep. Okay. I'm gonna

545
00:29:42,565 --> 00:29:46,285
Speaker 2:  do this math right. Math please leave this in. No,

546
00:29:46,345 --> 00:29:49,685
Speaker 2:  do not leave this in. Leave it in. Everyone's gonna find Dan if we leave

547
00:29:49,685 --> 00:29:50,045
Speaker 2:  this in.

548
00:29:51,785 --> 00:29:54,085
Speaker 2:  All right. Which I'll just point out is

549
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:57,765
Speaker 2:  999,400 iPad apps.

550
00:29:59,705 --> 00:30:01,005
Speaker 2:  That's a lot. iPad apps.

551
00:30:01,025 --> 00:30:02,045
Speaker 7:  That's a lot. iPad

552
00:30:02,045 --> 00:30:05,725
Speaker 2:  Apps. Anyway, among this, it's 600 is not bad if it's the right 600. But

553
00:30:05,725 --> 00:30:08,485
Speaker 2:  I'll just point out among the 600 they announced

554
00:30:09,135 --> 00:30:12,925
Speaker 2:  compatible apps from top cable services including Charter

555
00:30:13,205 --> 00:30:16,685
Speaker 2:  Spectrum, Comcast, Xfinity, Cox Contour, sling tv, and Verizon

556
00:30:17,235 --> 00:30:17,525
Speaker 2:  Fios.

557
00:30:18,115 --> 00:30:19,885
Speaker 7:  Yeah, that's what I want.

558
00:30:20,105 --> 00:30:23,645
Speaker 2:  If you are rocking the Verizon Fios app space, like I,

559
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:24,925
Speaker 2:  what are you doing man?

560
00:30:26,795 --> 00:30:30,245
Speaker 2:  Like paying your bills. If you, if you buy the space computer

561
00:30:30,985 --> 00:30:33,205
Speaker 2:  and take it out of its little marshmallow and put it on your head, you're

562
00:30:33,205 --> 00:30:36,925
Speaker 2:  like, let's open the Charter Spectrum app. What are you doing

563
00:30:37,065 --> 00:30:37,285
Speaker 2:  man?

564
00:30:37,525 --> 00:30:40,645
Speaker 7:  Well you gotta pay your bill so you can keep downloading stuff. Like

565
00:30:41,995 --> 00:30:45,125
Speaker 2:  It's, it's, that is the funniest. And that obviously you're trying to point

566
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:45,565
Speaker 2:  out like

567
00:30:46,475 --> 00:30:47,325
Speaker 7:  Entertainment.

568
00:30:47,475 --> 00:30:48,965
Speaker 2:  It's entertainment. It's

569
00:30:48,965 --> 00:30:49,365
Speaker 7:  Not Netflix,

570
00:30:49,435 --> 00:30:52,725
Speaker 2:  It's fine. Do you know what those apps, streaming four 80 p that they lie

571
00:30:52,745 --> 00:30:56,325
Speaker 2:  is seven 20 p. That is the lowest bitrate video you can get.

572
00:30:56,495 --> 00:31:00,125
Speaker 2:  Which is hilarious to me because I,

573
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:02,725
Speaker 2:  this is all buried in the review. I should quick post on this side just to

574
00:31:02,725 --> 00:31:06,545
Speaker 2:  break it out. It will not support VR video on YouTube. It's just like won't

575
00:31:06,545 --> 00:31:09,945
Speaker 2:  do it. Right. And they're like, because the VR video on YouTube is too low

576
00:31:09,945 --> 00:31:10,145
Speaker 2:  quality

577
00:31:11,115 --> 00:31:11,465
Speaker 7:  Apple.

578
00:31:12,005 --> 00:31:14,945
Speaker 2:  So it doesn't have a YouTube app. And if you go try to watch on 360 video

579
00:31:14,945 --> 00:31:18,745
Speaker 2:  on YouTube, it just won't work the end. Can I say

580
00:31:18,745 --> 00:31:22,105
Speaker 2:  one more Weedsy thing and then we can break out of this go? Yeah.

581
00:31:22,575 --> 00:31:26,465
Speaker 2:  It's very weedsy, but people asked us this question a lot

582
00:31:26,465 --> 00:31:29,145
Speaker 2:  and I didn't know the answer when we did the old episode. How does it smell?

583
00:31:29,565 --> 00:31:32,905
Speaker 2:  How does it smell? Okay. It smells like the future. Obviously

584
00:31:34,005 --> 00:31:36,505
Speaker 2:  the faintest whiff of roasted marshmallows.

585
00:31:38,305 --> 00:31:40,905
Speaker 2:  People ask about the MAC display sharing and I finally know how It works,

586
00:31:41,575 --> 00:31:45,445
Speaker 2:  which is very complicated. It is basically a 27 inch like studio

587
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:49,125
Speaker 2:  display or iMac display. So you tell your Mac, you're sharing to it, your

588
00:31:49,145 --> 00:31:53,005
Speaker 2:  Mac imagines a 27 inch 5K display. Ah mm. It

589
00:31:53,005 --> 00:31:56,725
Speaker 2:  runs the interface at 25 60 by 1440, which is a perfect two to one

590
00:31:56,725 --> 00:32:00,685
Speaker 2:  scale. That's how a 27 inch iMac works by default. You cannot change

591
00:32:00,705 --> 00:32:04,645
Speaker 2:  it. So a 27 inch iMac display can run it at other resolutions and it'll be

592
00:32:05,155 --> 00:32:07,885
Speaker 2:  fine. This one, it says it gives you a low resolution warning. So it wants

593
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:11,285
Speaker 2:  to run at this two to one scale, then it takes that 5K

594
00:32:12,605 --> 00:32:16,505
Speaker 2:  display and sends it as a 4K video stream to the Vision Pro, which you, you

595
00:32:16,505 --> 00:32:20,185
Speaker 2:  can then resize it will no. So it is not Pixel perfect at all. It

596
00:32:20,235 --> 00:32:23,505
Speaker 2:  looks great. I I have no complaints about how it looks, but the thing that

597
00:32:23,505 --> 00:32:27,425
Speaker 2:  is happening is that it is imagining a 5K display that a Mac knows how

598
00:32:27,425 --> 00:32:30,425
Speaker 2:  to run at because that is the 27 inch I mac, the 27 inch studio

599
00:32:32,165 --> 00:32:35,345
Speaker 2:  display. It runs the interface at 25 60 by 1440. But if you're running something

600
00:32:35,345 --> 00:32:38,985
Speaker 2:  4K, it has enough pixels to just do it 'cause it's 5K display. But then the

601
00:32:39,045 --> 00:32:42,655
Speaker 2:  thing that is happening is streaming at

602
00:32:42,655 --> 00:32:46,635
Speaker 2:  4K to the Vision Pro. So it compresses that and it makes us

603
00:32:46,745 --> 00:32:47,235
Speaker 2:  smaller.

604
00:32:47,495 --> 00:32:51,435
Speaker 7:  It sounds both technologically cool and also like I just

605
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:55,155
Speaker 7:  hate it from in the same way. I hate when people say Yeah this is

606
00:32:55,965 --> 00:32:59,955
Speaker 7:  seven 20 P streaming. Yeah. When it's secretly four 80.

607
00:33:00,065 --> 00:33:00,355
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

608
00:33:00,575 --> 00:33:04,075
Speaker 2:  Or lies. Or if they're like, this is hd. Yeah. And it's seven 20 lies Fox

609
00:33:05,145 --> 00:33:08,355
Speaker 2:  just putting that out there. Anyway, everyone will ask me that question and

610
00:33:08,355 --> 00:33:12,155
Speaker 2:  I that is the answer. And so it, it is correct. They keep calling it a 4K

611
00:33:12,155 --> 00:33:15,115
Speaker 2:  Mac display. It's actually a 5K Mac display, but it's actually running at

612
00:33:15,115 --> 00:33:19,035
Speaker 2:  25 60 by 1440 and whatever. It looks fine and you'll

613
00:33:19,035 --> 00:33:22,595
Speaker 2:  use it unless you need Pixel perfect accuracy. In which case take your face

614
00:36:27,295 --> 00:36:31,235
Speaker 2:  All right, that's enough. Talking with our eyes. Let's talk about our ears,

615
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:32,035
Speaker 2:  huh?

616
00:36:35,095 --> 00:36:36,875
Speaker 5:  All right, lay on this plane in Patel. Let's go.

617
00:36:39,635 --> 00:36:43,395
Speaker 2:  I tried. It's been such a long week. The Cinnamon Toast Crunch Crash

618
00:36:43,495 --> 00:36:45,235
Speaker 2:  is real man. It's happening

619
00:36:45,235 --> 00:36:46,395
Speaker 7:  In real time in front of me.

620
00:36:46,865 --> 00:36:50,835
Speaker 2:  Just melting over here. No, it's big news. This maybe bigger news

621
00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:54,725
Speaker 2:  than vision, bro. I, it's bigger news than it will impact more people more

622
00:36:54,925 --> 00:36:57,765
Speaker 2:  directly. Okay. Yeah, that's true. Cause more damage to the economy than

623
00:36:57,765 --> 00:37:01,605
Speaker 2:  you can I imagine. Josh Hawley is gonna write a build about it soon.

624
00:37:02,385 --> 00:37:06,205
Speaker 2:  The Universal Music Group in a fight with TikTok has pulled its catalog

625
00:37:06,675 --> 00:37:10,085
Speaker 2:  from TikTok. Its catalog includes Taylor, Swift,

626
00:37:10,775 --> 00:37:14,325
Speaker 2:  Drake, Olivia, Rodrigo Bad Bunny, basically

627
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:16,205
Speaker 2:  I think U2 is in the mix.

628
00:37:16,695 --> 00:37:20,005
Speaker 5:  Billy Eilish is on here. Harry Styles, Justin Bieber. Adele,

629
00:37:20,595 --> 00:37:20,885
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

630
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:21,645
Speaker 5:  All of

631
00:37:21,645 --> 00:37:24,565
Speaker 2:  Them. Universal. CEO Lucian Grange, who by the way was profiled in the New

632
00:37:24,565 --> 00:37:27,485
Speaker 2:  Yorker this week talking about his worries about the music industry in generated

633
00:37:27,505 --> 00:37:31,445
Speaker 2:  AI obviously ahead of them pulling

634
00:37:31,615 --> 00:37:34,805
Speaker 2:  their music from TikTok. They said TikTok has offered them horrible terms

635
00:37:34,945 --> 00:37:38,885
Speaker 2:  and is trying to bully them. They were this bad news for and

636
00:37:38,885 --> 00:37:41,645
Speaker 2:  it's gone. If you go look at Taylor Swift on TikTok right now, her catalog

637
00:37:41,825 --> 00:37:45,565
Speaker 2:  is gone. All those videos, all of those TikTok videos that have Taylor Swift

638
00:37:45,565 --> 00:37:48,845
Speaker 2:  and Olivia Rigo and all those other arson copyright notices.

639
00:37:49,075 --> 00:37:52,565
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And there's just a huge portion of TikTok that is now silent.

640
00:37:53,995 --> 00:37:57,605
Speaker 5:  It's nuts. And I assume this is ultimately just a negotiating

641
00:37:57,805 --> 00:38:01,045
Speaker 5:  tactic on both sides. And they'll, this feels to me sort of like a carriage

642
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,685
Speaker 5:  dispute with cable companies where it's like it's actually in everybody's

643
00:38:03,885 --> 00:38:07,845
Speaker 5:  interest to resolve this. And they will. but it Universal is clearly

644
00:38:08,505 --> 00:38:12,285
Speaker 5:  trying to prove that it is willing to pick this fight because I think

645
00:38:12,865 --> 00:38:16,605
Speaker 5:  TikTok has reached a point that, like I've been thinking a lot about Roku

646
00:38:16,635 --> 00:38:19,525
Speaker 5:  reading about this. 'cause there was this long period of time where Roku

647
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:23,005
Speaker 5:  was like every streaming company's favorite

648
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:27,325
Speaker 5:  streaming platform because it didn't have competitive content, it wasn't

649
00:38:27,325 --> 00:38:31,245
Speaker 5:  an advertising business, it was just the place people bought hardware to

650
00:38:31,245 --> 00:38:34,645
Speaker 5:  go to apps. And that was perfect for all the apps. Right. And so everybody

651
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,805
Speaker 5:  worked with Roku even when they wouldn't work with each other. When Apple

652
00:38:37,805 --> 00:38:40,805
Speaker 5:  and Amazon were beefing, they still both worked with Roku and then Roku got

653
00:38:40,805 --> 00:38:44,245
Speaker 5:  big enough that it said, we are going to start selling

654
00:38:44,645 --> 00:38:47,365
Speaker 5:  advertising on our own and we're actually gonna start making our own content

655
00:38:47,385 --> 00:38:51,155
Speaker 5:  and we're gonna start competing with you. But we're so powerful now that

656
00:38:51,155 --> 00:38:54,875
Speaker 5:  there's nothing you can do about it. Yep. And, and Roku started sort of just

657
00:38:55,015 --> 00:38:58,875
Speaker 5:  eating chunks of that market away. And it had gotten so big that there was

658
00:38:58,875 --> 00:39:01,915
Speaker 5:  nothing any of these players could do about it. And I think TikTok believes

659
00:39:02,295 --> 00:39:06,115
Speaker 5:  it is now that powerful. Yeah. That TikTok grew so much

660
00:39:06,535 --> 00:39:10,395
Speaker 5:  on the back of essentially like Goodwill and free marketing for all of these

661
00:39:11,255 --> 00:39:14,755
Speaker 5:  record labels and all the music being out there and became this like center

662
00:39:14,815 --> 00:39:18,515
Speaker 5:  of culture and now is turning around and saying like, look how

663
00:39:18,755 --> 00:39:22,635
Speaker 5:  powerful we are. You're gonna play by our rules now. Yeah. And I think Universal

664
00:39:22,635 --> 00:39:26,595
Speaker 5:  is one of the few companies probably in a position to actually hold

665
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:27,515
Speaker 5:  fast against that.

666
00:39:27,685 --> 00:39:30,875
Speaker 2:  Especially 'cause of its table of artists. And Universal, to be clear,

667
00:39:31,655 --> 00:39:35,355
Speaker 2:  is a big old school bully record label.

668
00:39:35,385 --> 00:39:39,155
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Like Lucian Grange is a very good operator. He has led the music

669
00:39:39,475 --> 00:39:42,955
Speaker 2:  industry through Universal through many shifts and he gets what he wants.

670
00:39:43,175 --> 00:39:46,755
Speaker 2:  Yep. He's the one who, when Fake Drake showed up on YouTube

671
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:51,315
Speaker 2:  is Lucy and Grange who pushed YouTube and Google into being like, here

672
00:39:51,315 --> 00:39:55,075
Speaker 2:  are responsible AI things and here's a new monetization system for

673
00:39:55,135 --> 00:39:58,435
Speaker 2:  AI generated music on YouTube. I dunno, that's great for the world. It's

674
00:39:58,435 --> 00:40:02,075
Speaker 2:  great for Universal music. Yes. Yeah. Right. And that's, that's his job.

675
00:40:02,075 --> 00:40:05,995
Speaker 2:  And he's gonna, but he has shown the ability to bully

676
00:40:06,435 --> 00:40:10,355
Speaker 2:  platforms using his gigantic catalog of artists. Right.

677
00:40:10,735 --> 00:40:12,315
Speaker 2:  And the artists all like him because,

678
00:40:12,455 --> 00:40:16,235
Speaker 5:  And there's hardly anybody with that specific kind of leverage against these

679
00:40:16,395 --> 00:40:17,035
Speaker 5:  platforms. Yeah. And he's,

680
00:40:17,035 --> 00:40:18,835
Speaker 7:  He's going after AI in this.

681
00:40:19,185 --> 00:40:22,235
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Specifically he wants protection against Generat of AI on this platform

682
00:40:22,235 --> 00:40:25,795
Speaker 2:  just as he has it on YouTube. I think the difference between TikTok and YouTube

683
00:40:25,815 --> 00:40:29,515
Speaker 2:  in this context is that YouTube is a music listening

684
00:40:29,755 --> 00:40:33,395
Speaker 2:  platform. And this is long confused, like YouTube itself, like

685
00:40:33,585 --> 00:40:36,875
Speaker 2:  YouTube YouTube, Google, very data-driven organizations.

686
00:40:37,595 --> 00:40:40,835
Speaker 2:  Susan Ky, the former CEO of YouTube used to say things like, we're a music

687
00:40:40,835 --> 00:40:44,435
Speaker 2:  service. Because if you look at the data, the thing people

688
00:40:44,815 --> 00:40:47,875
Speaker 2:  do the most on YouTube is they listen to music. Right?

689
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:51,355
Speaker 5:  Right. There's literally a stat on YouTube that is most

690
00:40:51,385 --> 00:40:55,315
Speaker 5:  watched non-music, video video on YouTube. Yeah. Like that's how big

691
00:40:55,315 --> 00:40:58,875
Speaker 5:  music is, is like Mr. Beast keeps breaking the non-music video

692
00:40:58,935 --> 00:41:02,315
Speaker 5:  record. Yeah. Right. 'cause that's YouTube is music videos slash

693
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:03,995
Speaker 5:  everything else. Right.

694
00:41:04,015 --> 00:41:07,395
Speaker 2:  Oh, right. And like the lo-fi beats girl, like Yeah. People turn on YouTube

695
00:41:07,415 --> 00:41:11,075
Speaker 2:  and they just like get access to music. Yeah. And so YouTube is a

696
00:41:11,075 --> 00:41:13,635
Speaker 2:  streaming and they, you know, they YouTube music exists and they, they've

697
00:41:13,635 --> 00:41:17,395
Speaker 2:  grown this thing and YouTube knows that. You know,

698
00:41:17,395 --> 00:41:21,355
Speaker 2:  Google executives now will tell you YouTube is a licensing product. Google

699
00:41:21,675 --> 00:41:25,315
Speaker 2:  searches a fair use product. YouTube is a licensing product. They know they

700
00:41:25,315 --> 00:41:28,595
Speaker 2:  need these relationships with the labels to preserve the existence of YouTube.

701
00:41:28,595 --> 00:41:32,475
Speaker 2:  Especially 'cause what people do the most is they just listen to music. Right.

702
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:36,485
Speaker 2:  TikTok is a discovery platform. Right. So and that is

703
00:41:36,485 --> 00:41:38,045
Speaker 2:  where their power comes from. Yeah.

704
00:41:38,065 --> 00:41:42,045
Speaker 7:  But I think I, I think music is still like intrinsic to its

705
00:41:42,045 --> 00:41:43,005
Speaker 7:  success to

706
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:43,885
Speaker 2:  It, but

707
00:41:44,185 --> 00:41:44,485
Speaker 7:  It has

708
00:41:44,485 --> 00:41:46,925
Speaker 2:  To listen. But TikTok to Spotify is the pathway there.

709
00:41:47,055 --> 00:41:50,805
Speaker 7:  Right. For, for music. But I'm saying for TikTok, the reason people

710
00:41:50,865 --> 00:41:54,525
Speaker 7:  go watch this stuff is because it's music. Like Right. But it's everybody

711
00:41:54,525 --> 00:41:55,125
Speaker 7:  doing cool

712
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:57,845
Speaker 2:  Soccer. But if your TikTok what you, what the data is showing you is people

713
00:41:58,165 --> 00:42:01,605
Speaker 2:  discover new songs on TikTok and then they go to Spotify and listen to them.

714
00:42:01,975 --> 00:42:05,885
Speaker 2:  Right. And you're saying to the music industry, you will not be able to

715
00:42:05,885 --> 00:42:09,445
Speaker 2:  break new artists to a younger generation without us. So you believe that

716
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:13,005
Speaker 2:  you have all this, whereas YouTube is looking at its data and saying if the

717
00:42:13,005 --> 00:42:16,325
Speaker 2:  music goes away, all of this is gone.

718
00:42:16,535 --> 00:42:20,485
Speaker 7:  Right. But I, I think UMG is saying you need us because

719
00:42:20,795 --> 00:42:23,925
Speaker 7:  otherwise the kids won't have any content to do their dances to,

720
00:42:24,265 --> 00:42:27,805
Speaker 2:  But they they will have other, this is the TikTok bet, right? Right. If your

721
00:42:27,865 --> 00:42:31,325
Speaker 2:  TikTok is, this is how you end up here, you're saying there will be other

722
00:42:31,325 --> 00:42:31,605
Speaker 2:  music.

723
00:42:31,635 --> 00:42:35,445
Speaker 7:  Yeah. They're hoping that somebody else is as big as Taylor Swift, which

724
00:42:35,445 --> 00:42:38,645
Speaker 7:  is like Right bold. Travis Kelsey is gonna start his own record. Like

725
00:42:38,645 --> 00:42:41,165
Speaker 2:  Right. The Super Bowl is in two weeks. This is a bad time to not have Taylor

726
00:42:41,165 --> 00:42:42,805
Speaker 2:  Swift on your, on your, on your platform.

727
00:42:42,805 --> 00:42:45,925
Speaker 5:  Well it's an interesting one though because like the, the, the three names

728
00:42:46,185 --> 00:42:49,085
Speaker 5:  we put in our story, which I think is sort of fascinating, are Taylor Swift

729
00:42:49,085 --> 00:42:52,605
Speaker 5:  Drake and Olivia Rodrigo. Right. I think Taylor Swift obviously does not

730
00:42:52,605 --> 00:42:56,485
Speaker 5:  need TikTok. TikTok is more in need of Taylor Swift

731
00:42:56,485 --> 00:42:59,725
Speaker 5:  than Taylor. Swift is TikTok. Right. don don't think that's arguable Drake.

732
00:42:59,955 --> 00:43:03,365
Speaker 5:  Same. Olivia Rodrigo, interesting case. Olivia

733
00:43:03,475 --> 00:43:06,405
Speaker 5:  Rodrigo very famous artist came up on Disney channel, had lots of things,

734
00:43:06,465 --> 00:43:09,885
Speaker 5:  but also her music broke in a big way on TikTok.

735
00:43:10,135 --> 00:43:13,325
Speaker 5:  Would Olivia Rodrigo be as big as she is now without TikTok?

736
00:43:14,185 --> 00:43:18,165
Speaker 5:  Who knows. Right? And, and she's huge. And I think ev the,

737
00:43:18,405 --> 00:43:21,125
Speaker 5:  I think you're right that the bet TikTok is making is that everyone who is

738
00:43:21,225 --> 00:43:24,965
Speaker 5:  not an a plus plus list artist

739
00:43:25,575 --> 00:43:29,045
Speaker 5:  needs TikTok more than TikTok needs them because there're, it is just an

740
00:43:29,325 --> 00:43:33,045
Speaker 5:  infinite supply of up and coming musicians all over TikTok

741
00:43:33,045 --> 00:43:33,565
Speaker 5:  everywhere.

742
00:43:33,565 --> 00:43:37,405
Speaker 2:  Right. Are you gonna break the little Boothing guy without Universal music?

743
00:43:37,595 --> 00:43:41,445
Speaker 2:  Like maybe you are right? Maybe. Yeah. What's the other look? Is

744
00:43:41,445 --> 00:43:45,205
Speaker 2:  TikTok just gonna do sea shanties? Yes. Maybe like,

745
00:43:45,265 --> 00:43:49,125
Speaker 2:  you know, like, do you remember Ricky desktop? We did a profile, lets see,

746
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:49,805
Speaker 2:  Ricky desktop,

747
00:43:50,065 --> 00:43:50,765
Speaker 5:  The DJ guy.

748
00:43:50,905 --> 00:43:54,525
Speaker 2:  He did the dice, beat the boat, beat the chicken wing beat. And then he,

749
00:43:54,525 --> 00:43:56,645
Speaker 2:  he was like, oh, now I'm a real producer and he won't talk to us anymore.

750
00:43:56,745 --> 00:43:59,605
Speaker 2:  Aw I don Ricky desktop. If you're out there, man, I hope you made it dude.

751
00:43:59,875 --> 00:44:01,605
Speaker 2:  Chicken Wing beat was fired.

752
00:44:03,505 --> 00:44:03,925
Speaker 5:  It was,

753
00:44:05,345 --> 00:44:08,685
Speaker 2:  It was. But like that's tiktoks bet is there's an infinite supply of new

754
00:44:08,685 --> 00:44:12,445
Speaker 2:  things to discover in Universal's. Bet is. You need rr like we have

755
00:44:12,545 --> 00:44:13,085
Speaker 2:  the stars.

756
00:44:13,465 --> 00:44:17,325
Speaker 7:  That's why I think this is fascinating. Like historically, I I just thought

757
00:44:17,325 --> 00:44:20,645
Speaker 7:  it was really interesting both because what David said earlier about how

758
00:44:20,645 --> 00:44:23,725
Speaker 7:  this is like the fights with the carriage fees. Yeah. It's the same thing.

759
00:44:23,725 --> 00:44:27,165
Speaker 7:  Like, oh, we are in a new entertainment age where now these fights are no

760
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:30,925
Speaker 7:  longer happening between TV companies and, and big studios. They're happening

761
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:34,925
Speaker 7:  between music companies and big social media platforms. And that's just

762
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:38,725
Speaker 7:  like, that's a we're in a whole new space. Yeah. And, and, and

763
00:44:38,725 --> 00:44:42,005
Speaker 7:  it's still rapidly developing. And now you have this whole generation of

764
00:44:42,005 --> 00:44:44,845
Speaker 7:  kids and it's like, okay, they're gonna stay on this platform that is doing

765
00:44:44,845 --> 00:44:48,485
Speaker 7:  their girl Taylor dirty, which is certainly a messaging that UMG can and

766
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:51,205
Speaker 7:  has pushed. Yeah. Or are they going to,

767
00:44:52,385 --> 00:44:56,005
Speaker 2:  Are you gonna protect Taylor Swift against ai? Yeah. That's what all Universal

768
00:44:56,005 --> 00:44:58,925
Speaker 2:  has to say. And the, the tiktoks right answer right now is like no.

769
00:44:59,195 --> 00:45:03,125
Speaker 5:  Well, and given, I mean a Taylor Swift is Taylor Swift,

770
00:45:03,145 --> 00:45:06,445
Speaker 5:  but also what's been happening with this, like the, the images that

771
00:45:06,445 --> 00:45:10,365
Speaker 5:  non-conceptual generative AI stuff of Taylor Swift on Twitter like

772
00:45:11,195 --> 00:45:15,125
Speaker 5:  this is, I I would not purport to

773
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:18,765
Speaker 5:  say that Universal timed this intentionally and perfectly, but boy, if they

774
00:45:18,765 --> 00:45:19,925
Speaker 5:  did, did they time it perfectly? Well,

775
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:23,765
Speaker 2:  Their contract was up on January 31st. They, they, the contract was

776
00:45:23,785 --> 00:45:24,285
Speaker 2:  pages ago. Yeah.

777
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:28,125
Speaker 5:  The timing just worked very well for them. But, but it did. And I think

778
00:45:28,145 --> 00:45:31,525
Speaker 5:  it is all of these things are very much coming together. And also one other

779
00:45:31,665 --> 00:45:35,245
Speaker 5:  wrench to throw in here is TikTok is relentlessly trying to

780
00:45:35,895 --> 00:45:39,565
Speaker 5:  close the TikTok to Spotify pipeline with TikTok music,

781
00:45:39,735 --> 00:45:42,445
Speaker 5:  which it is continuing to work on and continuing to test and continuing to

782
00:45:42,445 --> 00:45:46,045
Speaker 5:  roll out all over the world. And so TikTok is

783
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:49,405
Speaker 5:  becoming this thing where if It works and if TikTok music works,

784
00:45:50,315 --> 00:45:53,525
Speaker 5:  it's going to just like take the whole music industry

785
00:45:53,945 --> 00:45:56,725
Speaker 5:  inside of it. Yeah. And so if you're Universal you're like, okay, if we sign

786
00:45:56,765 --> 00:46:00,685
Speaker 5:  a bad deal now and TikTok music hits it suddenly becomes a really

787
00:46:00,785 --> 00:46:04,765
Speaker 5:  bad deal because now there's no, there's no out, there's nowhere to go because

788
00:46:04,765 --> 00:46:08,605
Speaker 5:  we've lost a whole generation of music listeners to this one

789
00:46:08,785 --> 00:46:09,485
Speaker 5:  app and service.

790
00:46:09,945 --> 00:46:13,365
Speaker 2:  Can I just, can I offer you some very, I just realized this, a very funny

791
00:46:14,415 --> 00:46:18,205
Speaker 2:  media inside baseball drama tidbit. Sure. The New

792
00:46:18,205 --> 00:46:21,765
Speaker 2:  Yorker this week has a profile of Lucian Grange. Conde

793
00:46:22,795 --> 00:46:26,685
Speaker 2:  Wired's cover this month is Z Show the

794
00:46:26,885 --> 00:46:30,405
Speaker 2:  CEO of TikTok. And they're just like battling it out across the covers of

795
00:46:30,405 --> 00:46:34,365
Speaker 2:  Conde Nest. It's pretty good. It's very good. I, but that's like where

796
00:46:34,365 --> 00:46:37,525
Speaker 2:  we're at, right? Like these people are out in public trying to advocate for

797
00:46:37,525 --> 00:46:41,205
Speaker 2:  themselves. I think TikTok is in danger. Look, I've called the top on this

798
00:46:41,205 --> 00:46:45,125
Speaker 2:  episode on camera pass through and eye tracking. I feel

799
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:47,125
Speaker 2:  like we're close to calling the top on TikTok. Wow.

800
00:46:47,785 --> 00:46:48,205
Speaker 7:  Really?

801
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:52,245
Speaker 2:  Yeah. If you TikTok, you know, it's a pandemic phenomenon.

802
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:56,325
Speaker 2:  They didn't just grow through like good vibes. They bought billions

803
00:46:56,325 --> 00:47:00,085
Speaker 2:  of dollars of Facebook advertising to get app installs. Right. So

804
00:47:00,225 --> 00:47:01,845
Speaker 7:  And that really pop Was it musically?

805
00:47:02,105 --> 00:47:05,205
Speaker 2:  It was musically. They bought musically and you know, they've got AI and

806
00:47:05,205 --> 00:47:09,165
Speaker 2:  the recommended, but like, this is a pandemic phenomenon that felt really

807
00:47:09,195 --> 00:47:12,525
Speaker 2:  good in that time. Like everyone's together, we're all doing these dances.

808
00:47:12,525 --> 00:47:14,205
Speaker 2:  Like we create cultural moments.

809
00:47:15,345 --> 00:47:17,925
Speaker 7:  We need to escape life and all we have to do is flick.

810
00:47:18,355 --> 00:47:20,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Right. And here's all these people talking. We're all baking bread.

811
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:24,805
Speaker 2:  The the kids are doing call and responses in department stores. You remember,

812
00:47:24,825 --> 00:47:27,205
Speaker 2:  you know, like they would all yell the thing and they yell the other like,

813
00:47:27,355 --> 00:47:29,245
Speaker 2:  what was it? It was, it was dirty.

814
00:47:30,895 --> 00:47:34,845
Speaker 2:  Which is great. That's what I love. Yeah. It was just fun. Like

815
00:47:34,845 --> 00:47:38,205
Speaker 2:  kids are terrifying. Their parents with this app is like, that's what we're

816
00:47:38,205 --> 00:47:42,165
Speaker 2:  here for. That's why The Verge exists, and now it's in the middle of

817
00:47:42,165 --> 00:47:45,565
Speaker 2:  what Co Doc Toro would call the in acidification cycle. Right? Right. So

818
00:47:46,385 --> 00:47:50,205
Speaker 2:  TikTok is no longer full of organic wonderful content from people

819
00:47:50,205 --> 00:47:53,565
Speaker 2:  who are bored in the pandemic. It's full of people trying to sell you stuff.

820
00:47:53,975 --> 00:47:57,925
Speaker 2:  Right. Including TikTok and more, more so than YouTube. Right.

821
00:47:57,925 --> 00:48:01,805
Speaker 2:  YouTube, you can have AdSense and you can just make videos and YouTube runs

822
00:48:01,805 --> 00:48:05,605
Speaker 2:  the pre-rolls and you get some money. And that's the end of that. The,

823
00:48:05,865 --> 00:48:09,045
Speaker 2:  the TikTok creator fund does not work that way, and it like doesn't even

824
00:48:09,065 --> 00:48:12,805
Speaker 2:  pay that much money. So if you get success on TikTok, you

825
00:48:12,805 --> 00:48:16,005
Speaker 2:  immediately start looking for a brand deal. Right. And you, you just see

826
00:48:16,005 --> 00:48:19,765
Speaker 2:  this, this thing happen so fast, and so it has

827
00:48:19,765 --> 00:48:23,645
Speaker 2:  just become like less good feeling in the

828
00:48:23,645 --> 00:48:27,085
Speaker 2:  same way that I would, I would say Instagram has had the exact same problem.

829
00:48:27,355 --> 00:48:29,925
Speaker 2:  Like Instagram is influencers now it's a

830
00:48:29,925 --> 00:48:30,125
Speaker 7:  Catalog.

831
00:48:30,595 --> 00:48:33,525
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Right. It's a, and TikTok is just headed that way and they've added

832
00:48:33,525 --> 00:48:36,725
Speaker 2:  the TikTok shop and now they're doing this thing where they're incentivizing

833
00:48:36,855 --> 00:48:40,165
Speaker 2:  horizontal videos Yeah. That are over a minute long to compete with YouTube

834
00:48:40,385 --> 00:48:43,165
Speaker 2:  and they're gonna add this music service. And you're like, you're getting

835
00:48:43,165 --> 00:48:47,045
Speaker 2:  farther and farther away from the thing that made it

836
00:48:47,095 --> 00:48:49,845
Speaker 2:  worth spending billions of dollars to at Appens install. Well,

837
00:48:49,845 --> 00:48:52,285
Speaker 7:  They're, they're doing the Elon Musk. They're trying to do an an Everything

838
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:52,525
Speaker 7:  app.

839
00:48:53,035 --> 00:48:56,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah, maybe. I just think like, when you open it, it's no longer like,

840
00:48:57,105 --> 00:49:00,805
Speaker 2:  here's a bunch of delightful things that are hap like it and maybe I just

841
00:49:00,805 --> 00:49:02,085
Speaker 2:  need to reset my algorithm or something.

842
00:49:02,265 --> 00:49:05,325
Speaker 5:  No, it's, it is what it is. I mean, and now like, I think the TikTok shop

843
00:49:05,425 --> 00:49:09,405
Speaker 5:  is the thing, right? Like, I hate it. If you wanna point at one thing, if

844
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:11,165
Speaker 5:  you wanna call the top Yeah. It's the TikTok

845
00:49:11,165 --> 00:49:14,365
Speaker 2:  Shop. By the way, to be clear, I'm not calling. I'm saying I feel comfortable

846
00:49:14,365 --> 00:49:15,845
Speaker 2:  saying we might be close to calling the top. No,

847
00:49:15,915 --> 00:49:19,565
Speaker 5:  NELI called the top. You heard it here first. Everybody done

848
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:21,765
Speaker 5:  four outta 10 on TikTok for me, like

849
00:49:21,765 --> 00:49:22,045
Speaker 7:  Hour.

850
00:49:23,425 --> 00:49:27,245
Speaker 5:  But no, the, the shop, not only did the TikTok shop come in

851
00:49:27,305 --> 00:49:30,565
Speaker 5:  and all of a sudden two outta three videos you saw was somebody trying to

852
00:49:30,565 --> 00:49:34,165
Speaker 5:  sell you something from the shop. John Herman at New York Mag wrote a really

853
00:49:34,165 --> 00:49:38,045
Speaker 5:  good piece about, he did a live stream after putting

854
00:49:38,045 --> 00:49:41,725
Speaker 5:  a used pencil in the TikTok shop and got thousands of

855
00:49:41,785 --> 00:49:45,685
Speaker 5:  viewers because TikTok just absolutely boost engagement

856
00:49:45,685 --> 00:49:49,045
Speaker 5:  through the roof as long as you're selling something. And now TikTok is running

857
00:49:49,045 --> 00:49:52,965
Speaker 5:  a test. We had a story this week where it's actually identifying

858
00:49:52,965 --> 00:49:56,605
Speaker 5:  products in videos with AI and offering purchase links to

859
00:49:57,945 --> 00:50:01,525
Speaker 5:  them. So not only is it incentivizing everybody to deliberately sell you

860
00:50:01,525 --> 00:50:04,165
Speaker 5:  stuff, it is going to sell you stuff even when you don't mean to sell stuff.

861
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:08,565
Speaker 5:  And all of the incentives on this platform now are going

862
00:50:08,565 --> 00:50:12,005
Speaker 5:  to be to sell you stuff from the TikTok shop, which by all accounts is being

863
00:50:12,005 --> 00:50:15,125
Speaker 5:  wildly subsidized and everything's very cheap and it's all sort of sketchy

864
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:18,925
Speaker 5:  and weird. But like that is going to break this platform faster

865
00:50:18,925 --> 00:50:19,485
Speaker 5:  than anything else.

866
00:50:19,565 --> 00:50:22,645
Speaker 7:  I have a question. Yeah. About the shop. Do you guys, like when you see the

867
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:25,605
Speaker 7:  little orange button, do you just scroll Yeah. Past it as

868
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:28,285
Speaker 2:  Quickly as possible? When I see the live indicator or when I see the TikTok

869
00:50:28,285 --> 00:50:31,285
Speaker 2:  shop, I'm like gone. Except same, same. There's one that gets me every time

870
00:50:31,345 --> 00:50:35,045
Speaker 2:  and it's wrecking my whole algorithmic situation. It is

871
00:50:35,045 --> 00:50:37,645
Speaker 2:  constantly trying to sell me off-brand DeWalt batteries.

872
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:39,445
Speaker 7:  And you're like, Ooh,

873
00:50:40,205 --> 00:50:43,565
Speaker 2:  I get so many TikTok shop live streams for like, you can buy five DeWalt,

874
00:50:43,825 --> 00:50:47,485
Speaker 2:  six amp hour batteries for just 20 bucks. Look at how well they're, and it's

875
00:50:47,485 --> 00:50:50,485
Speaker 2:  like, those are gonna light my house on fire and I just keep watching. They'd

876
00:50:50,485 --> 00:50:52,165
Speaker 2:  be like, are they gonna light on fire in this video?

877
00:50:52,625 --> 00:50:56,005
Speaker 7:  And it's also just QVC feel like anytime I see the live ones, I'm like, I,

878
00:50:56,325 --> 00:50:59,885
Speaker 7:  I don't watch QVC when I had like television. Why am I gonna do it on a TikTok?

879
00:51:00,005 --> 00:51:00,125
Speaker 7:  I

880
00:51:00,125 --> 00:51:02,525
Speaker 2:  Gotta go buy some batteries. I, it's in my brain. You think about

881
00:51:02,525 --> 00:51:03,285
Speaker 7:  It. Yeah. They got you.

882
00:51:03,835 --> 00:51:06,485
Speaker 2:  It's not even QVC. It's just a guy being like, look at these, look at how

883
00:51:06,485 --> 00:51:07,965
Speaker 2:  cheap these batteries are. Yeah. Seriously.

884
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:11,645
Speaker 5:  It's, yeah. It's not even as good as QVC. Like QVC tries a lot harder than

885
00:51:11,645 --> 00:51:14,725
Speaker 5:  this. But I also think like this, this is the same thing. And this is TikTok

886
00:51:14,725 --> 00:51:18,645
Speaker 5:  feeling itself, right? Yeah. I think Instagram, somebody wrote this, I think

887
00:51:18,645 --> 00:51:21,885
Speaker 5:  it was John Herman, but if it wasn't, I'm, I'm stealing this thesis from

888
00:51:21,885 --> 00:51:24,725
Speaker 5:  somebody else. So to whoever it was, I'm sorry, I forgot who you

889
00:51:25,745 --> 00:51:29,725
Speaker 5:  are. But Instagram has sort of identified this

890
00:51:29,725 --> 00:51:32,605
Speaker 5:  same thing where it's like, what if we made everything for sale but has done

891
00:51:32,605 --> 00:51:36,325
Speaker 5:  it very slowly and carefully because there is a sense of like, we don't wanna

892
00:51:36,905 --> 00:51:40,165
Speaker 5:  ruin the experience or at least not ruin it very quickly. TikTok doesn't

893
00:51:40,285 --> 00:51:43,885
Speaker 5:  give a shit about that. Yeah. TikTok is just like, oh, you like our

894
00:51:44,645 --> 00:51:48,045
Speaker 5:  app shopping now. And there is this sense of like, TikTok I

895
00:51:48,415 --> 00:51:52,405
Speaker 5:  think feels like it is inevitable now. Like it has won in a way

896
00:51:52,405 --> 00:51:55,605
Speaker 5:  that it can now turn on anything. It can change the algorithm. It can say,

897
00:51:55,605 --> 00:51:59,325
Speaker 5:  oh, we're doing horizontal videos now. It's literally going 90 NELI TikTok

898
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:00,645
Speaker 5:  is going, literally going

899
00:52:00,645 --> 00:52:03,125
Speaker 2:  90. Oh my God. I'm not ready to do that at all.

900
00:52:03,425 --> 00:52:06,765
Speaker 5:  No, I'm not even saying in reality, the app is going 90.

901
00:52:08,475 --> 00:52:08,925
Speaker 2:  They want

902
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:09,845
Speaker 5:  You to make horizontal videos.

903
00:52:10,345 --> 00:52:14,085
Speaker 2:  So one of my favorite things to do, this is gonna make me sound very pretentious

904
00:52:14,085 --> 00:52:17,805
Speaker 2:  when I say it. Whenever I leave America,

905
00:52:17,965 --> 00:52:19,085
Speaker 2:  I like to read books about America.

906
00:52:20,835 --> 00:52:21,965
Speaker 2:  It's just like a thing. I, I

907
00:52:21,965 --> 00:52:24,405
Speaker 7:  Also just tuck into some Tocqueville as soon as I leave.

908
00:52:24,545 --> 00:52:25,125
Speaker 2:  Not like that.

909
00:52:26,705 --> 00:52:27,005
Speaker 2:  I'm just

910
00:52:27,455 --> 00:52:30,285
Speaker 5:  Magic Neil. I just like unfurling the Pledge of Allegiance on the plane.

911
00:52:31,665 --> 00:52:35,365
Speaker 2:  Not like that. So one of my very favorite books is called The Conquest of

912
00:52:35,395 --> 00:52:39,285
Speaker 2:  Cool. It is about the American advertising in the sixties,

913
00:52:39,695 --> 00:52:43,645
Speaker 2:  after all the GIS came home and they got money and

914
00:52:43,645 --> 00:52:47,485
Speaker 2:  that's when the counterculture started. And it, it is, if you like Mad

915
00:52:47,485 --> 00:52:49,925
Speaker 2:  Men, you should read this book. 'cause it is the thesis of Mad Men, right?

916
00:52:49,925 --> 00:52:52,805
Speaker 2:  Is we're gonna take the counterculture, we're gonna take rebellion, we're

917
00:52:52,805 --> 00:52:56,365
Speaker 2:  gonna repackage it and sell it to people. And that means Americans just our

918
00:52:56,365 --> 00:53:00,125
Speaker 2:  culture is like kind of sarcastic and ironic all the time,

919
00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:04,045
Speaker 2:  right? Like we, we sell rebellion here in America and like selling out it,

920
00:53:04,715 --> 00:53:07,205
Speaker 2:  this is the most sellout our culture has ever been, but it's still like,

921
00:53:07,205 --> 00:53:10,045
Speaker 2:  ah, you sold that. Like that's, we're just not as sincere people here in

922
00:53:10,045 --> 00:53:13,625
Speaker 2:  the United States of America. Other countries are very

923
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:17,345
Speaker 2:  sincere, which is why I always read about our culture when I go, because

924
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:21,385
Speaker 2:  the contrast is real. And so you can see a little

925
00:53:21,385 --> 00:53:24,985
Speaker 2:  bit of that over commercialization because Instagram is

926
00:53:25,305 --> 00:53:28,585
Speaker 2:  American company that feels very American. Like it understands the thing

927
00:53:28,585 --> 00:53:32,505
Speaker 2:  that it is, and it knows it can't just slam shopping into your face

928
00:53:32,865 --> 00:53:36,145
Speaker 2:  culturally, the designers, the product managers atmosphere, like there's

929
00:53:36,145 --> 00:53:38,945
Speaker 2:  a lot of people who live here. Like it's an American product in that way,

930
00:53:38,945 --> 00:53:42,025
Speaker 2:  that it's American. They try to be very global. Like Instagram is huge all

931
00:53:42,025 --> 00:53:45,745
Speaker 2:  over the world. I I'm not denying that. I'm just saying there's a cultural

932
00:53:45,765 --> 00:53:49,705
Speaker 2:  aspect to the product's design that is reflective

933
00:53:49,705 --> 00:53:52,905
Speaker 2:  of the fact that you cannot just walk up to an American and be like, buy

934
00:53:52,905 --> 00:53:56,585
Speaker 2:  the shit. Like, it just kind of does. It sometimes just doesn't work, right?

935
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:59,945
Speaker 2:  Like there's, there's a little bit of ironic detachment that we accept here

936
00:53:59,975 --> 00:54:03,585
Speaker 2:  that we expect here. TikTok is just it rep

937
00:54:04,045 --> 00:54:07,265
Speaker 2:  it is a Chinese company. And I think there's a little bit of that.

938
00:54:08,015 --> 00:54:10,825
Speaker 2:  Like the reason there's everything apps in China, if you go to those places,

939
00:54:10,825 --> 00:54:14,265
Speaker 2:  they're ultra commercialized in a very different kind of way. Yeah. And I

940
00:54:14,265 --> 00:54:16,785
Speaker 2:  think, I'm not even saying it's good or bad, I'm just saying that, that it's

941
00:54:16,785 --> 00:54:18,265
Speaker 2:  a different culture. No,

942
00:54:18,265 --> 00:54:22,065
Speaker 7:  You, you can feel it. 'cause I think I also see it with

943
00:54:22,365 --> 00:54:26,185
Speaker 7:  how we're very reviews driven in this, this culture. Like in, in America,

944
00:54:26,325 --> 00:54:29,345
Speaker 7:  you go on Amazon, you go to places and you still are checking like, okay,

945
00:54:29,345 --> 00:54:33,025
Speaker 7:  does this have a good score? Am I gonna get this? And, and that, that shop

946
00:54:33,085 --> 00:54:33,705
Speaker 7:  app is like,

947
00:54:34,285 --> 00:54:35,785
Speaker 2:  No. So there's none of it, none of that.

948
00:54:35,785 --> 00:54:37,025
Speaker 7:  It's just like you wanna buy it, right?

949
00:54:38,175 --> 00:54:41,225
Speaker 2:  Yeah. There's just a different vibe. Yeah. And I, again, I don't, I don't,

950
00:54:41,385 --> 00:54:44,945
Speaker 2:  I I really am being careful. I don't mean to say like in a xenophobic way.

951
00:54:45,005 --> 00:54:48,825
Speaker 2:  I'm like literally just identifying a cultural difference

952
00:54:48,825 --> 00:54:52,705
Speaker 2:  in how the commercial content is presented to you in this app that I think

953
00:54:52,705 --> 00:54:54,505
Speaker 2:  is reflective of something else. Well, and

954
00:54:54,505 --> 00:54:58,345
Speaker 5:  You look at apps like Shein and Temu and like Wish

955
00:54:58,415 --> 00:55:01,985
Speaker 5:  Back in the day and like that vibe is

956
00:55:02,625 --> 00:55:06,145
Speaker 5:  a lot of that comes from China and is very much percolating all over the

957
00:55:06,145 --> 00:55:09,425
Speaker 5:  US now, right? Like there were all these years where all these different

958
00:55:09,425 --> 00:55:12,785
Speaker 5:  kinds of companies tried to make this influencer driven shopping work,

959
00:55:13,505 --> 00:55:17,465
Speaker 5:  which has been huge in China for years, right? Like a, a person will get

960
00:55:17,465 --> 00:55:21,265
Speaker 5:  on camera and just talk about products they like and they sell millions of

961
00:55:21,265 --> 00:55:23,865
Speaker 5:  dollars. And that has never been a thing in the US and it is like rapidly

962
00:55:24,305 --> 00:55:28,065
Speaker 5:  becoming one because that portion of culture

963
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:32,105
Speaker 5:  and commercial life is very much been exported to the US and I think it's

964
00:55:32,105 --> 00:55:33,465
Speaker 5:  happening really fast. Yeah. But

965
00:55:33,465 --> 00:55:33,865
Speaker 2:  It's just

966
00:55:34,425 --> 00:55:35,185
Speaker 7:  QVC

967
00:55:36,415 --> 00:55:39,625
Speaker 2:  Sort of, so it's just like sort of Yeah, but

968
00:55:39,625 --> 00:55:41,545
Speaker 5:  It's a really different generation, right? Like

969
00:55:42,065 --> 00:55:45,625
Speaker 2:  QVC is different. Actually it, I think it's, I was watching QVC in the lobby

970
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:49,505
Speaker 2:  of a hotel recently. It's a rock in life. What I read here,

971
00:55:49,745 --> 00:55:49,945
Speaker 2:  I was

972
00:55:49,945 --> 00:55:50,025
Speaker 7:  Like

973
00:55:50,715 --> 00:55:51,385
Speaker 2:  Highs and lows,

974
00:55:52,765 --> 00:55:53,785
Speaker 7:  So much excitement

975
00:55:54,775 --> 00:55:58,465
Speaker 2:  Signing the Apple security NDA for the Vision pro watching QVC in the hotel

976
00:55:58,465 --> 00:56:01,865
Speaker 2:  lobby, right? Highs and lows. And they were selling

977
00:56:03,105 --> 00:56:06,905
Speaker 2:  electric snowblower with a cord. And the poor woman

978
00:56:06,925 --> 00:56:10,385
Speaker 2:  had to be like, this cord is so convenient. And it was like just amazing.

979
00:56:10,385 --> 00:56:13,545
Speaker 2:  It was like some of the most amazing performance I've ever seen. I was like,

980
00:56:13,545 --> 00:56:16,545
Speaker 2:  screw the, screw the Oscars. Like, find this woman,

981
00:56:17,255 --> 00:56:18,825
Speaker 2:  this is the best actress in America.

982
00:56:20,725 --> 00:56:24,645
Speaker 2:  And like yeah, TikTok has some of that element to it, but a lot of it's just

983
00:56:24,645 --> 00:56:28,085
Speaker 2:  like showing you stuff like there's, there isn't that weird

984
00:56:28,085 --> 00:56:29,445
Speaker 7:  That that performative like isn't

985
00:56:29,445 --> 00:56:32,645
Speaker 2:  Best. Like Amazon has more QVC in it. And I'm telling you that I think that

986
00:56:32,645 --> 00:56:36,405
Speaker 2:  is like reflective of the sort of just like detachment you

987
00:56:36,405 --> 00:56:40,325
Speaker 2:  need. Yeah. Like it's, it's authentic, right? It's like very American

988
00:56:40,325 --> 00:56:44,205
Speaker 2:  authentic in its way. Oh, but it's not, but it obviously isn't. But

989
00:56:44,205 --> 00:56:47,005
Speaker 2:  that's what I mean, like yeah. There's, you have to build a little bit of

990
00:56:47,005 --> 00:56:50,685
Speaker 2:  artifice in our culture to go dead into selling. Right?

991
00:56:50,855 --> 00:56:53,685
Speaker 2:  Right. And in other cultures you don't. And that's just a cultural difference.

992
00:56:53,685 --> 00:56:56,885
Speaker 2:  And it's interesting to David's point to see that come through in the apps.

993
00:56:57,065 --> 00:57:00,765
Speaker 2:  What's really interesting is Meta doesn't operate in China,

994
00:57:01,225 --> 00:57:05,125
Speaker 2:  so we have not sent that back the other way. Right. Which is just

995
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:08,285
Speaker 2:  like also fascinating. Consider and it's good. I think for good reason they

996
00:57:08,285 --> 00:57:11,405
Speaker 2:  don't operate in China. Right? Like they don't want to give data to the Chinese

997
00:57:11,405 --> 00:57:13,925
Speaker 2:  government. Yeah. Google doesn't operate in China for the same reason

998
00:57:15,095 --> 00:57:18,845
Speaker 2:  Apple does. Interesting. So this moment for TikTok where I'm saying

999
00:57:18,845 --> 00:57:22,365
Speaker 2:  closest to calling the top, I wonder if that will be part of it too, where

1000
00:57:22,365 --> 00:57:26,245
Speaker 2:  their, their arrogance about what they are and what they represent to this

1001
00:57:26,245 --> 00:57:30,005
Speaker 2:  culture is gonna run into their ideas about what will work. Yeah,

1002
00:57:30,805 --> 00:57:31,365
Speaker 7:  I think that's right.

1003
00:57:31,455 --> 00:57:35,445
Speaker 2:  Right. And to, to run into sort of the essential nature of like

1004
00:57:35,505 --> 00:57:38,885
Speaker 2:  how Americans wish to consume advertising is gonna be really interesting.

1005
00:57:39,085 --> 00:57:42,645
Speaker 2:  'cause it's not like the TikTok users aren't already complaining about TikTok

1006
00:57:42,645 --> 00:57:45,885
Speaker 2:  shop. Right? Like they already don't like it. And now you're gonna take Taylor

1007
00:57:45,885 --> 00:57:49,405
Speaker 2:  Swift away and her label boss is gonna say you, they won't protect her from

1008
00:57:49,905 --> 00:57:53,575
Speaker 2:  AI clones of her voice. Like that's a, that's a

1009
00:57:53,775 --> 00:57:54,815
Speaker 2:  dangerous position. And there are

1010
00:57:55,115 --> 00:57:55,695
Speaker 7:  So many.

1011
00:57:56,165 --> 00:57:59,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Okay. That's enough TikTok.

1012
00:57:59,835 --> 00:58:00,125
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1013
00:58:00,875 --> 00:58:02,165
Speaker 2:  Killing it. This is the

1014
00:58:02,165 --> 00:58:04,045
Speaker 7:  Worst. I hate it. I hate it so much.

1015
00:58:05,205 --> 00:58:08,845
Speaker 2:  I I have been on such a like good healthy, clean eating

1016
00:58:08,915 --> 00:58:11,765
Speaker 2:  diet and exercise and this is the last week just reviewing this thing. I'm

1017
00:58:11,765 --> 00:58:13,885
Speaker 2:  just like, gimme the sugar. It's

1018
00:58:13,885 --> 00:58:17,565
Speaker 5:  A real, I think like everybody could, there, there's a version of this that

1019
00:58:17,565 --> 00:58:21,405
Speaker 5:  is very much like when you had like finals week in college. Yeah. And like

1020
00:58:21,405 --> 00:58:24,205
Speaker 5:  the whole rest of your life just sort of collapses around you.

1021
00:58:25,265 --> 00:58:28,805
Speaker 5:  That's what NELI has been through for the last seven days. Except in a,

1022
00:58:29,355 --> 00:58:29,645
Speaker 5:  that

1023
00:58:29,645 --> 00:58:33,525
Speaker 7:  Was like you would see him and the rest of the

1024
00:58:33,525 --> 00:58:36,525
Speaker 7:  team that worked on it and you Yeah. Yeah. It was like, oh you guys are in

1025
00:58:36,525 --> 00:58:36,885
Speaker 7:  finals.

1026
00:58:36,915 --> 00:58:40,845
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And now I have senioritis. Right. Let's string and Miller let you

1027
00:58:40,845 --> 00:58:41,165
Speaker 2:  go to six class.

1028
00:58:41,165 --> 00:58:42,125
Speaker 5:  We're doing any work again.

1029
00:58:42,705 --> 00:58:44,045
Speaker 2:  All right. We gotta take a break. We'll be right back.

1030
00:59:17,725 --> 00:59:21,485
Speaker 11:  This week on unexplainable, we're talking about the slight month of,

1031
00:59:23,135 --> 00:59:25,805
Speaker 11:  we're talking about the science of swearing.

1032
00:59:27,505 --> 00:59:30,685
Speaker 11:  If you stick your hand in a bucket of ice water, you might be able to tough

1033
00:59:30,685 --> 00:59:34,605
Speaker 11:  it out for a bit. But if you start saying something like donkey

1034
00:59:35,775 --> 00:59:38,645
Speaker 11:  eater, you'll be able to keep your hand in there way longer.

1035
00:59:39,105 --> 00:59:42,245
Speaker 12:  And the stronger you experience, that's where we're just being the better

1036
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:43,485
Speaker 12:  the painkiller It is.

1037
00:59:43,905 --> 00:59:47,605
Speaker 11:  But you don't get the same power from words like fudge only things like,

1038
00:59:49,735 --> 00:59:53,565
Speaker 12:  Which raises all these intriguing questions about what's happening when

1039
00:59:53,565 --> 00:59:54,205
Speaker 12:  we're f swearing

1040
00:59:56,185 --> 00:59:58,965
Speaker 11:  For new episodes every Wednesday. Listen to Unex

1041
01:00:00,645 --> 01:00:01,205
Speaker 11:  Playable.

1042
01:00:08,315 --> 01:00:10,895
Speaker 2:  Okay, we're back Lightning Round

1043
01:00:11,565 --> 01:00:13,055
Speaker 7:  Sponsored by Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

1044
01:00:14,475 --> 01:00:17,135
Speaker 2:  Do we have any individual sponsors of Lightning Round this week? I got some

1045
01:00:17,215 --> 01:00:20,735
Speaker 2:  emails last week, individual listeners who wanted to sponsor Lightning and

1046
01:00:20,735 --> 01:00:24,655
Speaker 2:  Liam, I've asked our sales team to reach out. Oh my God. If

1047
01:00:24,655 --> 01:00:27,695
Speaker 2:  you're an individual listener of the show and our sales team reaches out

1048
01:00:27,695 --> 01:00:31,495
Speaker 2:  to you, set the highest price you can think of. It's like

1049
01:00:31,825 --> 01:00:33,295
Speaker 2:  $50 million. Yeah.

1050
01:00:33,435 --> 01:00:37,055
Speaker 5:  But also if you just Venmo NELI 10 bucks. We'll, we'll we'll do it. It's

1051
01:00:37,055 --> 01:00:39,935
Speaker 2:  Fine. Wait, I guess it's the other way around. Our sales team should set

1052
01:00:39,935 --> 01:00:43,815
Speaker 2:  a high price. I don't know how advertising works. That's why I haven't

1053
01:00:43,815 --> 01:00:45,615
Speaker 2:  been able to sell the Lightning around to anyone.

1054
01:00:46,085 --> 01:00:46,735
Speaker 7:  Give us money.

1055
01:00:46,995 --> 01:00:49,895
Speaker 2:  I'm handing it, I'm giving it away to Smeg left and right.

1056
01:00:51,575 --> 01:00:54,155
Speaker 2:  You want a weird old fridge Smeg. Yeah. It's

1057
01:00:54,155 --> 01:00:56,955
Speaker 5:  Weird that Smeg has not reached out yet. So strange.

1058
01:00:57,135 --> 01:00:58,635
Speaker 7:  That's a weird name to choose.

1059
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:01,355
Speaker 2:  Actually, one of my favorite TikTok videos I've seen recently is a guy who

1060
01:01:01,475 --> 01:01:04,515
Speaker 2:  refurbish his fridge. Really? And I think they know, it's like they're listening

1061
01:01:04,515 --> 01:01:06,155
Speaker 2:  to me. Yeah. So like, show 'em some fridge videos.

1062
01:01:07,345 --> 01:01:08,555
Speaker 7:  They're listening. All right.

1063
01:01:08,685 --> 01:01:09,755
Speaker 2:  Cranz, what you got? I'm gonna

1064
01:01:09,935 --> 01:01:13,795
Speaker 7:  Be mean and do two Ooh. I haven't reviewed a giant headset

1065
01:01:13,825 --> 01:01:17,235
Speaker 7:  this week. That's so I'm gonna be selfish. We'll allow it and do too. So

1066
01:01:17,235 --> 01:01:21,195
Speaker 7:  my first one is, is streaming stuff, which is Hulu is cracking down on

1067
01:01:21,435 --> 01:01:25,075
Speaker 7:  password sharing. It's, it's been a while, but they, they said, yeah, we're

1068
01:01:25,075 --> 01:01:28,835
Speaker 7:  in on this too. We also want more of your money, which means more of you

1069
01:01:28,835 --> 01:01:32,675
Speaker 7:  need to use your passwords. Sign in. David,

1070
01:01:32,735 --> 01:01:33,675
Speaker 7:  how are you feeling about that?

1071
01:01:34,025 --> 01:01:37,915
Speaker 5:  This sucks. So, I, I forget where I first heard this. I think it

1072
01:01:37,915 --> 01:01:41,555
Speaker 5:  was on somebody on the the Town podcast, which is a very good podcast that

1073
01:01:41,555 --> 01:01:45,435
Speaker 5:  everybody should listen to who was saying that we as society

1074
01:01:46,025 --> 01:01:49,475
Speaker 5:  screwed up by not being angrier when Netflix did this.

1075
01:01:49,665 --> 01:01:53,235
Speaker 5:  Because we all just kinda rolled with it. We were like, oh yeah, Netflix

1076
01:01:53,445 --> 01:01:56,795
Speaker 5:  isn't gonna let you share your Netflix password. That sort of makes sense.

1077
01:01:56,795 --> 01:01:59,515
Speaker 5:  And then it worked and everybody else is like, oh dope, we can do that too.

1078
01:01:59,735 --> 01:02:03,515
Speaker 5:  We should have been so much angrier at this. Yeah. 'cause this sucks

1079
01:02:04,015 --> 01:02:07,555
Speaker 5:  and is bad and is just shaking users down

1080
01:02:08,335 --> 01:02:11,995
Speaker 5:  for every penny they can get from them. And we've just all kind of allowed

1081
01:02:11,995 --> 01:02:15,235
Speaker 5:  it to happen. And I can't get mad now that Hulu's doing it because I didn't

1082
01:02:15,235 --> 01:02:18,755
Speaker 5:  get mad when anybody else did it. But I wish I had, I should have been angrier.

1083
01:02:18,755 --> 01:02:19,445
Speaker 5:  We all should have.

1084
01:02:19,665 --> 01:02:23,005
Speaker 2:  Can I tell you a text I got literally as we've been podcasting? It's from

1085
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:26,725
Speaker 2:  my sister. It's a screenshot of Netflix and it says, looks

1086
01:02:26,725 --> 01:02:28,365
Speaker 2:  like our Netflix jig is up.

1087
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:33,965
Speaker 2:  This is real. Alex is looking at it. It's

1088
01:02:34,545 --> 01:02:38,365
Speaker 5:  My version specifically is Hulu. I have an incredibly insecure

1089
01:02:38,685 --> 01:02:42,165
Speaker 5:  password on my Hulu because I haven't changed it in probably a decade.

1090
01:02:42,685 --> 01:02:45,805
Speaker 5:  Because there, I mean there honestly must be 30 people out there in the world

1091
01:02:45,935 --> 01:02:49,245
Speaker 5:  using my Hulu account, including at least one ex-girlfriend.

1092
01:02:50,075 --> 01:02:53,365
Speaker 5:  I've been married for a long time now. Like it's, it's, it's

1093
01:02:53,985 --> 01:02:55,165
Speaker 5:  bad times coming

1094
01:02:55,265 --> 01:02:57,925
Speaker 7:  For a lot of people. Hulu sharing Hulu passwords is how I found out a friend

1095
01:02:57,985 --> 01:03:01,485
Speaker 7:  had a baby. It's because I was like, where's all this baby contact Wow. Coming

1096
01:03:01,755 --> 01:03:05,685
Speaker 7:  from? That's this is too much. And I was like, oh, she's still got my password.

1097
01:03:06,035 --> 01:03:08,685
Speaker 7:  Yeah, that's rude. Stop watching baby stuff. Make a new account.

1098
01:03:09,065 --> 01:03:11,845
Speaker 2:  So I. Amazon also launched ads this week, right? Yeah.

1099
01:03:11,905 --> 01:03:13,165
Speaker 7:  Amazon. Like speaking

1100
01:03:13,165 --> 01:03:14,805
Speaker 5:  Of things we should get loudly mad about.

1101
01:03:15,075 --> 01:03:18,925
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It, it feels like between last week and this week we're really like

1102
01:03:18,975 --> 01:03:22,685
Speaker 7:  fully swung into the dark ages of streaming. We're fully in that moment where

1103
01:03:22,685 --> 01:03:25,935
Speaker 7:  like, it sucks 'cause it, it, it sucks.

1104
01:03:25,965 --> 01:03:29,415
Speaker 2:  This is when the cable bundle just like comes roaring back. It's

1105
01:03:29,415 --> 01:03:30,775
Speaker 7:  Here, right? Like no,

1106
01:03:30,775 --> 01:03:33,815
Speaker 2:  It's not here. You can't just be like, I'll, I mean this is why Apple's announcing

1107
01:03:33,815 --> 01:03:34,935
Speaker 2:  the Charter Spectrum app and a vision.

1108
01:03:35,135 --> 01:03:38,535
Speaker 7:  I was, I was like, you can if you like I, I I like Verizon. Verizon's like,

1109
01:03:38,535 --> 01:03:42,415
Speaker 7:  would you like Disney Plus and Hulu? Yeah. For like a little less

1110
01:03:42,415 --> 01:03:43,855
Speaker 7:  money and maybe we'll throw in Apple tv.

1111
01:03:43,955 --> 01:03:47,135
Speaker 2:  No, I want like an old school cable box app now. Give me a grid guide. Start

1112
01:03:47,135 --> 01:03:48,335
Speaker 2:  playing stuff as soon, soon as I open

1113
01:03:48,335 --> 01:03:48,975
Speaker 7:  It. That's what I'm saying. That's,

1114
01:03:49,055 --> 01:03:53,015
Speaker 2:  I mean this is just too b we're about to have the CO2 behind. So I'll just

1115
01:03:53,015 --> 01:03:56,495
Speaker 2:  ask her if this is what's happening. It's, but man,

1116
01:03:57,335 --> 01:03:59,895
Speaker 2:  I wish one of these services would be like, all right, we're just doing it.

1117
01:04:00,075 --> 01:04:01,935
Speaker 2:  All the content's in 4K and it's everything.

1118
01:04:03,065 --> 01:04:05,365
Speaker 7:  The Apple TV kind of does that, but

1119
01:04:05,365 --> 01:04:05,965
Speaker 2:  It's not everything.

1120
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:07,985
Speaker 7:  They don't have a lot,

1121
01:04:08,095 --> 01:04:12,025
Speaker 2:  Even baseball and Apple TV Plus isn't in 4K and they own it. That's

1122
01:04:12,065 --> 01:04:13,585
Speaker 7:  'cause they're doing sports. If they weren't doing sports

1123
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:17,265
Speaker 2:  Tv, everything 4K and Apple TV plus and they, they literally own it, they're

1124
01:04:17,265 --> 01:04:20,905
Speaker 2:  gonna get to doing 180 degree 3D video of soccer

1125
01:04:21,385 --> 01:04:23,105
Speaker 2:  before they stream it in 4K to a tv.

1126
01:04:23,445 --> 01:04:24,465
Speaker 5:  God, that's real. I

1127
01:04:24,545 --> 01:04:25,705
Speaker 7:  A hundred percent believe that. By

1128
01:04:25,705 --> 01:04:27,745
Speaker 2:  The way, Addie called this out yesterday and I didn't mention it in this,

1129
01:04:27,805 --> 01:04:30,785
Speaker 2:  it started to talk with the vision program. Apple keeps flying on 360 videos

1130
01:04:30,845 --> 01:04:34,665
Speaker 2:  and they're 100% 180 degree videos. Oh yeah. You turn around it's just black.

1131
01:04:35,525 --> 01:04:37,665
Speaker 2:  And they're like, but it's a 360 degree. It's like,

1132
01:04:38,285 --> 01:04:41,985
Speaker 7:  No, you have to go all the way around. Did you show him the, the Michelle

1133
01:04:41,985 --> 01:04:42,305
Speaker 7:  Obama video?

1134
01:04:42,655 --> 01:04:45,545
Speaker 2:  Just like I, I can't, why do you think I was trying to watch YouTube vr Dude

1135
01:04:46,915 --> 01:04:48,215
Speaker 7:  Relive the moment I

1136
01:04:48,255 --> 01:04:51,975
Speaker 2:  Was like, be there again. A million years ago, a little baby

1137
01:04:52,085 --> 01:04:55,335
Speaker 2:  NELI Patel interviewed Michelle Obama at the White House with VR cameras.

1138
01:04:56,895 --> 01:04:58,055
Speaker 7:  I was so jealous of that video.

1139
01:04:58,075 --> 01:05:00,775
Speaker 2:  And we're just reliving it again. We're just reliving it. They're like, well,

1140
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:03,575
Speaker 2:  a new frontier of immersive entertainment. I was like, no, I was with the

1141
01:05:03,575 --> 01:05:06,775
Speaker 2:  first lady in a circle. You look all around,

1142
01:05:07,395 --> 01:05:10,695
Speaker 2:  you could watch Trey Shehorn, our executive producer being like, ramp that

1143
01:05:10,695 --> 01:05:12,975
Speaker 2:  up. Just like our current producer is doing right now.

1144
01:05:14,115 --> 01:05:14,815
Speaker 5:  Six outta 10.

1145
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:16,335
Speaker 7:  It's

1146
01:05:16,335 --> 01:05:18,245
Speaker 5:  Great. Alex, what was your other one? But

1147
01:05:18,245 --> 01:05:21,965
Speaker 7:  Yeah, but my other, my other Lightning round is, so

1148
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:26,445
Speaker 7:  Amazon was gonna buy iRobot, the, the, the robo vac company and

1149
01:05:27,305 --> 01:05:31,045
Speaker 7:  the EU said, no, can't do that. Yeah. So it, so they pulled out

1150
01:05:31,345 --> 01:05:34,685
Speaker 7:  the CEO of iRobot. Colin Eng is is gone.

1151
01:05:34,685 --> 01:05:37,205
Speaker 7:  350 people are getting laid off. Oh

1152
01:05:37,205 --> 01:05:37,405
Speaker 5:  No.

1153
01:05:38,025 --> 01:05:41,805
Speaker 7:  The companies like, and it sucks. And, and Tui are incredible

1154
01:05:41,885 --> 01:05:45,245
Speaker 7:  reviewer of everything. Smart Home wrote a really lovely piece this week

1155
01:05:45,245 --> 01:05:48,365
Speaker 7:  just being like, they were doing it. They were doing all the cool stuff.

1156
01:05:48,365 --> 01:05:51,645
Speaker 7:  And they're having to compete with companies like ufi who is owned by a bigger

1157
01:05:51,645 --> 01:05:55,405
Speaker 7:  company. Like all of the other big robo vacs are owned by companies in

1158
01:05:55,405 --> 01:05:59,285
Speaker 7:  China with lots and lots of money behind them. And iRobot's out there being

1159
01:05:59,285 --> 01:06:03,125
Speaker 7:  like, we're gonna figure out robotics in the home all by ourselves with no

1160
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:06,605
Speaker 7:  money. But yeah, so, so it's kind of a bummer. It's, it's unclear what's

1161
01:06:06,605 --> 01:06:09,725
Speaker 7:  gonna happen with iRobot. 'cause it seems like they really needed that acquisition

1162
01:06:09,905 --> 01:06:13,805
Speaker 7:  for the influx of cash because in order to compete with their competitors,

1163
01:06:13,805 --> 01:06:17,645
Speaker 7:  they either have to like make their already very expensive, Robax

1164
01:06:18,235 --> 01:06:22,165
Speaker 7:  more expensive, or they have to not com

1165
01:06:22,225 --> 01:06:23,805
Speaker 7:  or like they need money. Okay.

1166
01:06:23,805 --> 01:06:27,605
Speaker 2:  So I'll say two things about this. One, the reasoning that iRobot and

1167
01:06:27,605 --> 01:06:31,285
Speaker 2:  Amazon gave was we see no pathway to approval in the

1168
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:35,125
Speaker 2:  eu. Yes. Which is now what everyone says. Yes. And you know, the

1169
01:06:35,245 --> 01:06:38,045
Speaker 2:  eus argument was Amazon sells these vacuums. They're gonna buy this vacuum

1170
01:06:38,045 --> 01:06:40,525
Speaker 2:  company and prioritize their own vacuums against other vacuums. You can feel

1171
01:06:40,525 --> 01:06:44,485
Speaker 2:  how that, about that However you want. Amazon, just like every other company

1172
01:06:44,505 --> 01:06:47,205
Speaker 2:  is doing layoffs and cost cutting and

1173
01:06:48,395 --> 01:06:51,845
Speaker 2:  Dave Limp, the old head of hardware is gone and Panos pane for Microsoft

1174
01:06:51,845 --> 01:06:55,205
Speaker 2:  is in and they're cutting that whole division down. There's a part of me

1175
01:06:55,205 --> 01:06:59,045
Speaker 2:  that says blaming the Europeans is a very convenient excuse to not

1176
01:06:59,365 --> 01:07:01,085
Speaker 2:  randomly buy a robotic vacuum company.

1177
01:07:01,435 --> 01:07:02,205
Speaker 5:  It's certainly possible

1178
01:07:02,265 --> 01:07:05,325
Speaker 2:  For a smart home strategy that has not panned out for Amazon. Yeah. Like

1179
01:07:05,545 --> 01:07:08,565
Speaker 7:  It doesn't, their, their strategy just doesn't make sense

1180
01:07:08,945 --> 01:07:11,685
Speaker 2:  So, I'm just saying like, yeah, it's great to blame the EU and I encourage

1181
01:07:11,685 --> 01:07:15,205
Speaker 2:  you to blame the Europeans at any given time. The EU culture is so broken,

1182
01:07:15,235 --> 01:07:17,685
Speaker 2:  they have no apps just putting that out there.

1183
01:07:18,525 --> 01:07:22,325
Speaker 5:  Well there's also there, there's a weird thing happening where like the Roomba

1184
01:07:22,785 --> 01:07:26,685
Speaker 5:  was a genuinely like groundbreaking thing. iRobot

1185
01:07:26,685 --> 01:07:29,245
Speaker 5:  has made a lot of really good products for a really long time. That thing,

1186
01:07:29,245 --> 01:07:31,885
Speaker 5:  to your point, Alex is becoming completely commoditized, right? Like you

1187
01:07:31,885 --> 01:07:35,605
Speaker 5:  can get a pretty good, it's not as good as the best Roomba,

1188
01:07:35,825 --> 01:07:39,685
Speaker 5:  but a pretty good robot vacuum for like less than $200

1189
01:07:39,785 --> 01:07:42,925
Speaker 5:  now. These things are getting cheap really fast.

1190
01:07:44,145 --> 01:07:48,125
Speaker 5:  And then the other thing was, iRobot's whole idea was like, we are

1191
01:07:48,975 --> 01:07:51,525
Speaker 5:  based on the knowledge that we're getting and the understanding that we have

1192
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:54,925
Speaker 5:  of Your home, literally because we have a thing that's in there mapping where

1193
01:07:54,955 --> 01:07:58,645
Speaker 5:  your chairs are. Yeah. We're gonna be able to understand Your home in a

1194
01:07:58,965 --> 01:08:02,325
Speaker 5:  uniquely powerful way and we're gonna be able to do things with it. Like

1195
01:08:02,525 --> 01:08:04,725
Speaker 5:  remember when this got announced and all of a sudden everybody was panicked

1196
01:08:04,725 --> 01:08:08,365
Speaker 5:  about Amazon having the literal floor map of my house. Like that's a real

1197
01:08:08,365 --> 01:08:11,565
Speaker 5:  thing. Yeah. But there's also a ton that a company like Amazon with its resources

1198
01:08:11,585 --> 01:08:15,485
Speaker 5:  can do with that. If like NELI is saying you believe that Alexa and

1199
01:08:15,665 --> 01:08:19,165
Speaker 5:  Robots and Ring and all that stuff. Like, you can see how it all comes together,

1200
01:08:19,905 --> 01:08:23,725
Speaker 5:  but it seems increasingly clear that Amazon has just decided that's not

1201
01:08:24,045 --> 01:08:25,565
Speaker 5:  a winning strategy for Amazon.

1202
01:08:25,755 --> 01:08:29,485
Speaker 2:  Well, we have not heard a word from Pan ESP Pan yet. Yep. He's got the,

1203
01:08:30,155 --> 01:08:34,125
Speaker 2:  he's not a retiring man, you know? Yeah. He's

1204
01:08:34,125 --> 01:08:37,805
Speaker 2:  a very aggressive personality. He wants to win. I'm dying to hear what his

1205
01:08:37,805 --> 01:08:41,685
Speaker 2:  vision for all this is. We know what Dave Lim's vision was. He

1206
01:08:41,825 --> 01:08:45,405
Speaker 2:  has been on decoder. We've talked to him lots and lots, but it,

1207
01:08:45,985 --> 01:08:49,685
Speaker 2:  he never actually brought Ring and Alexa and all this other stuff together

1208
01:08:49,745 --> 01:08:53,165
Speaker 2:  in a cohesive way. Right. They're very separate ecosystems. one of my favorite

1209
01:08:53,165 --> 01:08:56,445
Speaker 2:  things about Amazon is they run Ring and Blink two different home security

1210
01:08:56,445 --> 01:08:58,765
Speaker 2:  camera systems that don't talk to each other.

1211
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:00,205
Speaker 7:  It's such a mess.

1212
01:09:00,315 --> 01:09:03,805
Speaker 2:  It's just utterly bizarre to me. Talking about QVC. The Blink

1213
01:09:04,005 --> 01:09:07,245
Speaker 2:  QVC commercials are incredible. So good. If you ever watch one, it's just

1214
01:09:07,245 --> 01:09:11,085
Speaker 2:  like these cameras just run on batteries. Like, it's just like, what is happening

1215
01:09:11,085 --> 01:09:11,285
Speaker 2:  here?

1216
01:09:12,345 --> 01:09:14,845
Speaker 7:  Eli, I think you have a beautiful future as a QVC host.

1217
01:09:15,205 --> 01:09:18,325
Speaker 2:  I would do so. Well, I can speak directly to the American Psyche, by the

1218
01:09:18,325 --> 01:09:21,685
Speaker 2:  way, the Europeans have one app, it's called Spotify. Apple hates it.

1219
01:09:22,405 --> 01:09:23,345
Speaker 2:  That's what I got for you.

1220
01:09:25,325 --> 01:09:27,865
Speaker 2:  The, by the way, the other thing I wanna say, I feel very badly for the people

1221
01:09:27,865 --> 01:09:30,985
Speaker 2:  who are gonna lose their jobs. Yeah. And I, I hear an argument out in the

1222
01:09:30,985 --> 01:09:33,425
Speaker 2:  world that's like, if you don't allow these exits, all these people lose

1223
01:09:33,425 --> 01:09:36,945
Speaker 2:  their jobs. I will just remind everyone that what happens when big companies

1224
01:09:36,945 --> 01:09:40,225
Speaker 2:  by smaller companies is that they lay everyone off and the companies fail

1225
01:09:40,225 --> 01:09:41,425
Speaker 2:  and they go away anyway. Yep.

1226
01:09:41,495 --> 01:09:44,985
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I it's, it's one of those things where, I don't know, like, it seems

1227
01:09:44,985 --> 01:09:48,305
Speaker 7:  like iRobot was always kind of like, not Dubin great. Yeah. This was probably

1228
01:09:48,305 --> 01:09:51,505
Speaker 7:  always gonna happen regardless of who bought them. And now it's just like,

1229
01:09:51,535 --> 01:09:54,785
Speaker 7:  well, we don't have to hide, we can't hide behind that anymore. We're laying

1230
01:09:54,785 --> 01:09:56,265
Speaker 7:  these people off. The CEO is leaving.

1231
01:09:56,805 --> 01:09:59,025
Speaker 2:  Amazon had bought this company six months now. They would've laid off 300

1232
01:09:59,025 --> 01:10:02,025
Speaker 2:  people. Yeah. Warner Brothers, Warner Bros. Discovery bought Warner Brothers.

1233
01:10:02,055 --> 01:10:04,825
Speaker 2:  They just, she was get keep getting rid of them. Yep.

1234
01:10:05,745 --> 01:10:09,705
Speaker 2:  Mergers are bad is my general argument that I'll keep making The Europeans

1235
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:12,145
Speaker 2:  have it right there. They're good at that. But I do think there's a little

1236
01:10:12,145 --> 01:10:16,005
Speaker 2:  bit of, a little bit of opportunistic un undoing of the deal.

1237
01:10:16,125 --> 01:10:18,285
Speaker 7:  I, I like that's a, that's a good theory. I I like that theory.

1238
01:10:18,315 --> 01:10:19,525
Speaker 2:  Yeah. All right. David, what's yours?

1239
01:10:20,115 --> 01:10:23,365
Speaker 5:  There's so many I want to talk about, but I will avoid talking about top

1240
01:10:23,365 --> 01:10:25,365
Speaker 5:  level domains for one day.

1241
01:10:25,365 --> 01:10:26,725
Speaker 2:  That was gonna be mine. Okay. You can

1242
01:10:26,725 --> 01:10:30,525
Speaker 5:  Have that. That's so cool. I'll talk about Snap, which I think

1243
01:10:30,735 --> 01:10:34,485
Speaker 5:  today Thursday announced that it is recalling and

1244
01:10:34,555 --> 01:10:38,445
Speaker 5:  refunding every single pixie drone that it sold because of

1245
01:10:38,445 --> 01:10:42,205
Speaker 5:  a problem with the batteries Ooh. And I just want to

1246
01:10:42,205 --> 01:10:46,085
Speaker 5:  sort of briefly mourn Snap interesting

1247
01:10:46,285 --> 01:10:48,365
Speaker 5:  hardware company, which I believe is dead.

1248
01:10:49,055 --> 01:10:50,325
Speaker 7:  There was just one drone, right?

1249
01:10:50,395 --> 01:10:53,085
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It was called the Pixie. It was like we had a, we had a great video

1250
01:10:53,085 --> 01:10:55,885
Speaker 5:  about it. Alex Heath made a really cool thing in like a Yeah, I remember

1251
01:10:55,885 --> 01:10:57,005
Speaker 5:  like weird carnival looking building

1252
01:10:57,385 --> 01:10:59,725
Speaker 7:  His joy as it like flew out of his hand. It's

1253
01:10:59,725 --> 01:11:03,005
Speaker 5:  Delightful. And it's such a cool idea is like, it, it was essentially like

1254
01:11:03,215 --> 01:11:06,805
Speaker 5:  autonomous little yellow drone that could land in your hand and fly around

1255
01:11:06,805 --> 01:11:09,525
Speaker 5:  and take pictures of you and like, makes perfect sense for what Snap is trying

1256
01:11:09,525 --> 01:11:13,485
Speaker 5:  to do. Snap also sort of relentlessly trying to make spectacles a

1257
01:11:13,485 --> 01:11:16,365
Speaker 5:  thing, but has been very quiet about that for a while now.

1258
01:11:17,845 --> 01:11:21,365
Speaker 5:  I just, there was a, there was a minute that that's not true. There were

1259
01:11:21,405 --> 01:11:24,685
Speaker 5:  a lot of minutes where I believed Snap was like a

1260
01:11:25,185 --> 01:11:29,165
Speaker 5:  sneaky company that was gonna win in a lot of really big ways. And I

1261
01:11:29,165 --> 01:11:32,765
Speaker 5:  am mourning the end of that thesis a little more every single day. Oh

1262
01:11:32,995 --> 01:11:36,725
Speaker 5:  yeah. But RIP the Pixie, which flew

1263
01:11:36,965 --> 01:11:39,365
Speaker 5:  apparently too high and too hot and too fast.

1264
01:11:40,985 --> 01:11:42,085
Speaker 2:  And its batteries explo.

1265
01:11:42,225 --> 01:11:43,125
Speaker 5:  Its batteries exploded.

1266
01:11:43,795 --> 01:11:47,365
Speaker 2:  It's amazing that Instagram and Meta got there faster with the

1267
01:11:47,475 --> 01:11:50,205
Speaker 2:  Raybans than snapped it with the spectacles. Yeah. Well

1268
01:11:50,205 --> 01:11:51,325
Speaker 7:  I think money had something to

1269
01:11:51,325 --> 01:11:54,865
Speaker 2:  Do with that. I'm sure money had something to do with it, but that people

1270
01:11:54,865 --> 01:11:58,825
Speaker 2:  were lining up for those spectacles. Like Snap was a big platform

1271
01:11:59,405 --> 01:12:03,265
Speaker 2:  and it never made the turn out of teens messaging

1272
01:12:03,395 --> 01:12:06,505
Speaker 2:  Right. To whatever the next thing is. Like they invented the filters. Yeah.

1273
01:12:07,425 --> 01:12:10,665
Speaker 5:  I mean do you remember how best, how long the, I, the, the joke went that

1274
01:12:10,665 --> 01:12:14,585
Speaker 5:  Evan Spiegel was the chief product officer at Facebook in addition

1275
01:12:14,585 --> 01:12:17,265
Speaker 5:  to being the CEO at Snap. Like it was true for a long time

1276
01:12:17,525 --> 01:12:20,425
Speaker 2:  And it turns out the product he needed to invent was advertising revenue

1277
01:12:23,655 --> 01:12:27,625
Speaker 2:  that is still much better at that than Evan Spiegel. Yep. All mine is

1278
01:12:29,115 --> 01:12:30,015
Speaker 2:  top level domains.

1279
01:12:30,015 --> 01:12:31,015
Speaker 5:  Yeah, buddy. Yeah.

1280
01:12:31,715 --> 01:12:35,655
Speaker 2:  I'm so excited about this story, especially because it's

1281
01:12:35,725 --> 01:12:39,015
Speaker 2:  such a bad top level domain. It's,

1282
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:43,415
Speaker 2:  it's not great if you know anything about the internet. So if you are a huge

1283
01:12:43,445 --> 01:12:46,735
Speaker 2:  nerd like me or Cranz Yeah. You have a lot of local,

1284
01:12:46,915 --> 01:12:48,215
Speaker 7:  Not David. David's not nerdy

1285
01:12:48,215 --> 01:12:51,615
Speaker 2:  Enough. Yeah, absolutely. No, no. There's one thing I know is that Cranz

1286
01:12:51,615 --> 01:12:54,695
Speaker 2:  and I are navigating to more local devices on our network than David can

1287
01:12:54,695 --> 01:12:57,695
Speaker 2:  even contemplate David's out there being like this pixie drone's amazing.

1288
01:13:00,345 --> 01:13:04,215
Speaker 5:  Right? I'm outside, you know, driving cool cars and picking up

1289
01:13:04,215 --> 01:13:07,615
Speaker 5:  chicks and you guys are just like 1 9 2

1290
01:13:07,945 --> 01:13:08,415
Speaker 5:  0.168. Yeah, let's go.

1291
01:13:08,995 --> 01:13:12,615
Speaker 2:  So you, if you have configured a router, if you

1292
01:13:12,765 --> 01:13:16,095
Speaker 2:  like me, have a little raspberry pi Tamagotchi doing a home bridge

1293
01:13:16,655 --> 01:13:20,415
Speaker 2:  situation. If you're like Cranz and you operate, I write server questionably

1294
01:13:20,415 --> 01:13:21,455
Speaker 2:  legal plex server.

1295
01:13:21,845 --> 01:13:22,255
Speaker 7:  It's legal

1296
01:13:22,675 --> 01:13:24,055
Speaker 2:  For the local community.

1297
01:13:25,695 --> 01:13:29,295
Speaker 2:  I still don't have the password. I'm just saying if you're like crayons and

1298
01:13:29,295 --> 01:13:31,775
Speaker 2:  you've been ripping Blu-rays to your plex server

1299
01:13:32,605 --> 01:13:34,535
Speaker 7:  Over a decade very legally,

1300
01:13:35,275 --> 01:13:39,215
Speaker 2:  You know Yeah. You gotta type 1 92 0.168, do whatever

1301
01:13:39,215 --> 01:13:42,895
Speaker 2:  to get to your right. And sometimes you

1302
01:13:42,905 --> 01:13:46,215
Speaker 2:  can fudge it with a dot local domain. There's all this stuff you can do.

1303
01:13:46,395 --> 01:13:49,855
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And sometimes it doesn't work. So, I can the internet corporation for

1304
01:13:49,855 --> 01:13:53,255
Speaker 2:  assigned names and numbers, incredible name for this organization that we

1305
01:13:53,255 --> 01:13:53,935
Speaker 2:  do not talk about enough.

1306
01:13:54,075 --> 01:13:55,495
Speaker 5:  Did not know that's what that stood for. That

1307
01:13:55,495 --> 01:13:58,295
Speaker 2:  This company, it's a, it's a, that's a long story, but it's just amazing

1308
01:13:58,295 --> 01:14:02,215
Speaker 2:  that like got themselves to, I can, you know, they just

1309
01:14:02,415 --> 01:14:05,375
Speaker 2:  reversed engineered the acronym, the internet corporation for assigned names

1310
01:14:05,375 --> 01:14:09,335
Speaker 2:  and numbers has proposed a new top level domain

1311
01:14:10,315 --> 01:14:13,705
Speaker 2:  for devices on your own network. So instead of typing 1

1312
01:14:13,705 --> 01:14:15,745
Speaker 2:  9 2 0.168, you'll

1313
01:14:17,425 --> 01:14:17,585
Speaker 2:  type whatever internal

1314
01:14:17,935 --> 01:14:18,905
Speaker 5:  NELI internal.

1315
01:14:20,455 --> 01:14:22,105
Speaker 7:  Nope. Hard pass.

1316
01:14:23,885 --> 01:14:24,305
Speaker 7:  Not to

1317
01:14:25,165 --> 01:14:28,505
Speaker 2:  The other choice. My friends was do private.

1318
01:14:32,415 --> 01:14:34,345
Speaker 7:  They should have put a pearl on there.

1319
01:14:35,615 --> 01:14:38,305
Speaker 2:  They, they ultimately chose dot internal

1320
01:14:40,725 --> 01:14:44,585
Speaker 2:  as it found. Quote dot private may carry the unintended imputation

1321
01:14:44,585 --> 01:14:45,185
Speaker 2:  of privacy.

1322
01:14:49,305 --> 01:14:53,025
Speaker 2:  I don't know. Yeah. I'm just saying Local was sitting right

1323
01:14:53,025 --> 01:14:53,305
Speaker 2:  there.

1324
01:14:55,795 --> 01:14:56,785
Speaker 2:  Stuff dot internal

1325
01:14:58,365 --> 01:14:58,745
Speaker 7:  Get out.

1326
01:14:58,895 --> 01:15:02,785
Speaker 2:  Like my Home bridge is HomeBridge local. You can't, I'm happy to tell it

1327
01:15:02,785 --> 01:15:05,345
Speaker 2:  to you because if you try to go to it, you'll go to Your home Bridge. This

1328
01:15:05,345 --> 01:15:06,105
Speaker 2:  works. I'm

1329
01:15:06,105 --> 01:15:06,665
Speaker 7:  So excited

1330
01:15:06,665 --> 01:15:09,905
Speaker 2:  To hack guys. That's like a hack. That's like a, that's like a Bonjour hack

1331
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:13,465
Speaker 2:  or whatever. Yeah. This is like a different, like an actual top level

1332
01:15:13,485 --> 01:15:17,185
Speaker 2:  domain that will mean this thing on the internet. And they went with DOT

1333
01:15:17,305 --> 01:15:20,665
Speaker 2:  internal because dot private. Yeah.

1334
01:15:20,735 --> 01:15:21,265
Speaker 7:  It's too much.

1335
01:15:21,445 --> 01:15:25,385
Speaker 2:  The implication would is private, not the other thing.

1336
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:30,855
Speaker 7:  I think we found that actually we're not the nerdiest people. It's, I can,

1337
01:15:31,435 --> 01:15:35,335
Speaker 2:  Anyway, there it's not done yet. It's not happening. You can go to the I

1338
01:15:35,335 --> 01:15:39,255
Speaker 2:  can website and leave comments. Please behave yourselves. Wink,

1339
01:15:39,325 --> 01:15:42,815
Speaker 2:  wink. It's ridiculous. I love it.

1340
01:15:43,375 --> 01:15:46,855
Speaker 2:  I lo I like, I like that people have so much stuff on their own

1341
01:15:46,855 --> 01:15:50,295
Speaker 2:  networks that this is a thing that we, I just like, people used to

1342
01:15:50,595 --> 01:15:52,575
Speaker 2:  insist that no one would ever have anything on their own network.

1343
01:15:52,875 --> 01:15:56,735
Speaker 5:  You know what else you could have done as the tlds.network? What, what a,

1344
01:15:56,735 --> 01:15:57,895
Speaker 5:  what a crazy idea that would've been

1345
01:15:58,405 --> 01:15:59,735
Speaker 2:  Yeah, my stuff. My

1346
01:15:59,735 --> 01:16:00,935
Speaker 5:  Stuff stuff I think is the one.

1347
01:16:01,155 --> 01:16:01,935
Speaker 7:  My dot stuff.

1348
01:16:02,315 --> 01:16:03,535
Speaker 5:  My dot stuff. Yeah.

1349
01:16:05,715 --> 01:16:06,855
Speaker 2:  Be Behind Firewall.

Speaker 5:  Behind Firewall. David, no Girls Allowed. That's my, that's my

1351
01:16:11,175 --> 01:16:11,695
Speaker 5:  local network.

1352
01:16:12,725 --> 01:16:16,495
Speaker 2:  It's very good. Simon's gonna write in and correct me on how Dot Local

1353
01:16:16,775 --> 01:16:19,495
Speaker 2:  actually works, but I know it's not official. TLD that's why I'm saying it.

1354
01:16:19,695 --> 01:16:20,095
Speaker 2:  I will say

1355
01:16:20,235 --> 01:16:24,055
Speaker 5:  In the abstract, I love the idea of having a name for

1356
01:16:24,055 --> 01:16:27,855
Speaker 5:  your local stuff. don don't. Instead of all of the IP address

1357
01:16:28,175 --> 01:16:28,375
Speaker 5:  Nonsense.

1358
01:16:28,975 --> 01:16:32,095
Speaker 7:  I memorized all of those IP addresses so long

1359
01:16:32,095 --> 01:16:33,255
Speaker 5:  Ago. It feels like a you problem.

1360
01:16:33,775 --> 01:16:37,295
Speaker 7:  I don't wanna have to go back and redo that. I need to know where my,

1361
01:16:37,595 --> 01:16:39,015
Speaker 7:  my doorbell is at all times.

1362
01:16:39,315 --> 01:16:42,695
Speaker 2:  I'm sorry. Here's how Local works. Local is a special use domain name reserved

1363
01:16:42,695 --> 01:16:46,295
Speaker 2:  by the internet engineering task force. The IETF, the

1364
01:16:46,355 --> 01:16:48,295
Speaker 2:  rivals to ican. don don't know the rivals Shark,

1365
01:16:48,435 --> 01:16:48,655
Speaker 5:  Jet

1366
01:16:48,785 --> 01:16:52,495
Speaker 2:  Shark fight. I think they should fight and it is not allowed to be a top

1367
01:16:52,495 --> 01:16:55,535
Speaker 2:  level domain. Oh. It has been reserved by the IETF.

1368
01:16:56,275 --> 01:16:59,815
Speaker 2:  If ICAN comes and takes it, that's a task force baby.

1369
01:17:00,635 --> 01:17:04,455
Speaker 2:  All right. That's, that's, I I'm sorry. It has been a

1370
01:17:04,455 --> 01:17:05,175
Speaker 2:  very long CIN Week
