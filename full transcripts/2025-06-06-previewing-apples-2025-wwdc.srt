Description: Developer conference season is almost over, but we've got one show left to see: Apple's WWDC begins on Monday. Nilay, David, and Joanna Stern spend time going through both what they expect to see at the show, and why this year's WWDC might feel a bit different than in years past. Apple is in a tricky place with regulators, developers, and users alike, and has some genuine explaining to do. After that, they talk about the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, and David's surprisingly easy adventure to acquire one. We also have a bit of smart glasses and AI gadgets news to discuss, so we do that too. Then it's time for Brendan Carr is a Dummy, and an update on a couple of the interesting new fediverse projects launching this week.


2
00:01:31,535 --> 00:01:31,885
Speaker 7:  Hello

3
00:01:32,685 --> 00:01:35,885
Speaker 5:  Joanna's live from her office at the Wall Street Journal. It's very fancy.

4
00:01:35,915 --> 00:01:38,285
Speaker 5:  This might be the fanciest situation we've ever had in the Birch cast.

5
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:39,445
Speaker 7:  We have a map.

6
00:01:40,865 --> 00:01:43,525
Speaker 6:  If you're watching this on YouTube, you should know that just outside of

7
00:01:43,525 --> 00:01:47,085
Speaker 6:  Joanna's frame is like 6,000 square feet of her office

8
00:01:47,595 --> 00:01:50,925
Speaker 6:  with several couches and a bunch of like glass

9
00:01:51,115 --> 00:01:53,925
Speaker 6:  statues. Like that's the, that's the image I want you to have in your mind

10
00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:54,245
Speaker 6:  through

11
00:01:54,275 --> 00:01:56,205
Speaker 5:  This entire show. Have you ever seen succession? Yes,

12
00:01:56,205 --> 00:02:00,005
Speaker 7:  Exactly. And we also have a bunch of typewriter. This is a

13
00:02:00,005 --> 00:02:01,805
Speaker 7:  newspaper and we have news print everywhere.

14
00:02:02,305 --> 00:02:04,685
Speaker 5:  Can you yell Stop the presses right now. What? What would happen?

15
00:02:06,105 --> 00:02:09,405
Speaker 7:  All the people that work on video will stop their presses. So they sit right

16
00:02:09,465 --> 00:02:10,325
Speaker 7:  out my office.

17
00:02:11,635 --> 00:02:15,045
Speaker 5:  It's very good. The people who are tasked with like Joanna YouTube stunts

18
00:02:15,045 --> 00:02:17,725
Speaker 5:  will be like, what presses where we supposed to get a press?

19
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:21,995
Speaker 7:  They're like, we did get that press two years ago. Yeah, it was a sandwich

20
00:02:21,995 --> 00:02:22,275
Speaker 7:  press.

21
00:02:22,465 --> 00:02:25,395
Speaker 5:  Like the person holding the kayak for your next trip to an island with a

22
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,275
Speaker 5:  robot will be like, I don't, is this a press?

23
00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:29,875
Speaker 7:  We've done that in like three years. I,

24
00:02:30,065 --> 00:02:33,795
Speaker 5:  It's still the best stunt you've ever done. I, I, I know. Go, if you're listening

25
00:02:33,795 --> 00:02:37,755
Speaker 5:  this just type Joanna Kayak Island and you'll find it. Lots of stuff to talk

26
00:02:37,755 --> 00:02:41,515
Speaker 5:  about. Next week is wwc, so we're gonna preview that e

27
00:02:41,665 --> 00:02:44,515
Speaker 5:  Elon and Trump are in some sort of fight, but we're not gonna talk about

28
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:47,515
Speaker 5:  it too much. I just wanna bring that up in the context. It's going on with

29
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:51,315
Speaker 5:  starlink lot on starlink actually the switch to launched and David

30
00:02:51,495 --> 00:02:55,475
Speaker 5:  has won. I do. So we gotta talk about that. But I wanna start with

31
00:02:55,515 --> 00:02:59,335
Speaker 5:  a little news. We won some awards this week. It's a real

32
00:02:59,335 --> 00:03:02,815
Speaker 5:  thing. We won best news and entertainment design. The American Society of

33
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:05,855
Speaker 5:  Magazine editors gave us the award for best news and entertainment design

34
00:03:05,855 --> 00:03:09,815
Speaker 5:  for our 2004 package, of which I would say David is

35
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:13,175
Speaker 5:  at fault for 'cause it was his idea. And then everyone had to think about

36
00:03:13,175 --> 00:03:16,695
Speaker 5:  2004 for like six months. That's basically how that turned out.

37
00:03:17,095 --> 00:03:20,335
Speaker 5:  But that had incredible art. We'll link it. You can go see it. It's one of

38
00:03:20,335 --> 00:03:23,095
Speaker 5:  the best interactions we've ever done. Our incredible creative director,

39
00:03:23,095 --> 00:03:25,935
Speaker 5:  Kristen and our art director Kath, worked on that really hard. They got to

40
00:03:25,935 --> 00:03:26,535
Speaker 5:  accept the award.

41
00:03:27,195 --> 00:03:30,775
Speaker 6:  The award by the way, is spectacular. No worries. 'cause they just, they

42
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:34,415
Speaker 6:  just printed out the top of the website and put it onto like a, a

43
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:37,015
Speaker 6:  glass plaque and gave it to Cath.

44
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:40,695
Speaker 5:  Well, in a glass plaque. It's not, it's not like rubber cemented on the top.

45
00:03:40,895 --> 00:03:41,375
Speaker 5:  It's in it

46
00:03:41,725 --> 00:03:45,615
Speaker 6:  Fair. It's but it's just like a printed piece of paper. It is inside the

47
00:03:45,615 --> 00:03:46,135
Speaker 6:  glass plaque.

48
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:50,255
Speaker 5:  Very good. It's very good. And then Mia au won the ASME next

49
00:03:50,255 --> 00:03:53,655
Speaker 5:  award, which is for the best reporters under 30.

50
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:58,215
Speaker 5:  I wanna be careful distinguish it from 30 under 30. If you win 30 under 30,

51
00:03:58,715 --> 00:03:59,615
Speaker 5:  you go to jail.

52
00:04:00,075 --> 00:04:00,295
Speaker 6:  Yes,

53
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:04,245
Speaker 7:  Yes. You get handcuffs, golden handcuffs you would get.

54
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:08,085
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it's a, that's the fast track to being incarcerated. Mia just wanted

55
00:04:08,085 --> 00:04:10,565
Speaker 5:  for being great young journalist and actually Nancy the word by saying, this

56
00:04:10,565 --> 00:04:12,925
Speaker 5:  is the future of journalism and then I heckled her for being the future of

57
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,725
Speaker 5:  journalism for the rest of the night. It's very good. Congratulations to

64
00:04:37,165 --> 00:04:38,745
Speaker 5:  you know, that's just not what we do here.

65
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:42,025
Speaker 7:  You just sold me, but I already paid so

66
00:04:42,225 --> 00:04:44,265
Speaker 5:  Cheaper than the Wall Street Journal. That's, that's,

67
00:04:44,465 --> 00:04:47,305
Speaker 7:  I mean that is a good sale right there. That's true. Yeah.

68
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:51,425
Speaker 5:  Alright, let's start. It's, It is developer conference season. We've had

69
00:04:51,665 --> 00:04:54,385
Speaker 5:  Microsoft, we've had Google, there's been some other ones in the backdrop.

70
00:04:54,385 --> 00:04:58,245
Speaker 5:  Anthropic had its first one just to, you know, join the, the fund. The

71
00:04:58,245 --> 00:05:01,885
Speaker 5:  last one, traditionally, sort of the big one is

72
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,765
Speaker 5:  Apple's. WC it's coming up next week. I would, I would just

73
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:09,685
Speaker 5:  wanna start with a context of wwe. C So this week there was a, a huge

74
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:13,445
Speaker 5:  court ruling that said Apple can't block

75
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:17,765
Speaker 5:  web links in the app store. So right. Apple had the big case

76
00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:21,685
Speaker 5:  with Epic. They went back and forth for five years. Eventually the judge

77
00:05:21,685 --> 00:05:25,165
Speaker 5:  in that case got fed up with Apple accused it of lying on the stand of having

78
00:05:25,165 --> 00:05:28,925
Speaker 5:  executives lie on the stand. Referred that executive for a criminal contempt

79
00:05:28,925 --> 00:05:32,805
Speaker 5:  proceedings and said, screw it. We're done here. You have to allow alternative

80
00:05:32,805 --> 00:05:36,005
Speaker 5:  payment systems in the app store. This is a huge threat to Apple's business.

81
00:05:36,005 --> 00:05:39,525
Speaker 5:  They immediately appeal and said, stay the ruling while we appeal how wrong

82
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:43,485
Speaker 5:  this is. And they lost that fight. So the, the ruling is in

83
00:05:43,485 --> 00:05:46,845
Speaker 5:  effect, while Apple goes through appeal, which effectively means four years

84
00:05:47,345 --> 00:05:50,845
Speaker 5:  now Apple is gonna have to allow links in the app store,

85
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:52,325
Speaker 5:  allow payment links in the app stores.

86
00:05:52,545 --> 00:05:56,245
Speaker 6:  It feels like that's done now. Like I'm, I'm sort of at the point where

87
00:05:56,425 --> 00:05:59,565
Speaker 6:  the, and and we talked about this before, that like even if Apple had gotten

88
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:03,685
Speaker 6:  this particular victory, it, it would've felt

89
00:06:03,685 --> 00:06:07,045
Speaker 6:  like putting toothpaste back in the tube in a certain way. And I think we've

90
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:10,965
Speaker 6:  already seen so many of these apps update to go with other systems

91
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:14,285
Speaker 6:  of linking out and all of a sudden you realize like, oh I can click the button

92
00:06:14,385 --> 00:06:18,165
Speaker 6:  in the Kindle app and go buy the Kindle book. Like what a world.

93
00:06:18,465 --> 00:06:21,765
Speaker 6:  And I think it was always gonna be very hard to go back from that. And I

94
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:25,645
Speaker 6:  feel like now at this point it feels very hard to me

95
00:06:25,645 --> 00:06:29,605
Speaker 6:  to imagine Apple winning and undoing all of this. Like it's so crystal

96
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:33,645
Speaker 6:  clear how crappy a move that would be for Apple that I think

97
00:06:33,645 --> 00:06:37,365
Speaker 6:  like even the company that is seems increasingly clear being or

98
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:41,245
Speaker 6:  increasingly happy being the bad guy. I don't, I don't know how you

99
00:06:41,245 --> 00:06:41,805
Speaker 6:  do that one.

100
00:06:42,025 --> 00:06:45,765
Speaker 5:  Yep. And Fortnite is back in the store. They had a big fight and the judge

101
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:48,205
Speaker 5:  VA said Figure this out or I'm gonna figure out for you. And Apple said,

102
00:06:48,205 --> 00:06:50,165
Speaker 5:  we figured out Fortnite is back in the store. We have an interview actually

103
00:06:50,165 --> 00:06:53,725
Speaker 5:  with Tim Sweeney. JP Peters interviewed Tim Sweeney this week and he said,

104
00:06:53,805 --> 00:06:55,805
Speaker 5:  I thought this would be two weeks and it was five years, but we were happy

105
00:06:55,805 --> 00:06:59,045
Speaker 5:  to wait it out and because 'cause they won of course he's happy to wait it

106
00:06:59,045 --> 00:06:59,165
Speaker 5:  out.

107
00:06:59,505 --> 00:07:02,045
Speaker 6:  Tim Sweeney's so full of shit. Yeah. Can we just say that

108
00:07:02,645 --> 00:07:03,245
Speaker 5:  Tim Sweeney,

109
00:07:03,425 --> 00:07:07,125
Speaker 6:  Who has at every point of this process been like, well we're just over here

110
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,245
Speaker 6:  trying to do our best and we just want to do what's, and it's like no, no,

111
00:07:10,245 --> 00:07:13,965
Speaker 6:  no, no. What has actually happened is you have found every single way to

112
00:07:13,965 --> 00:07:17,485
Speaker 6:  pick a fight with Apple in court that you have been able to for five years,

113
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:21,205
Speaker 6:  you have decided that It is worth all of the money that you make from V Bucks

114
00:07:21,705 --> 00:07:25,485
Speaker 6:  to just knife Apple over and over for five years. Yeah. So it's like

115
00:07:25,505 --> 00:07:28,365
Speaker 6:  if if they had put him back in the store, he would've found something else

116
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,445
Speaker 6:  to do to get kicked outta the store. I don like, I just, I just don't believe

117
00:07:31,445 --> 00:07:32,725
Speaker 6:  him for one second.

118
00:07:32,905 --> 00:07:35,645
Speaker 7:  Why didn't you interview Tim Sweeney? I feel like that would've been the

119
00:07:35,645 --> 00:07:39,085
Speaker 7:  best interview there you are full of shit. Tim. Tim Sweeney. Yeah. I'd like

120
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:40,245
Speaker 7:  to open with that.

121
00:07:40,665 --> 00:07:42,085
Speaker 6:  Tim, who else would you have sued

122
00:07:42,315 --> 00:07:45,365
Speaker 5:  When you send the pitch emails to book the, the episodes or like here's our,

123
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:48,365
Speaker 5:  here's our angle. You're full of shit. I mean it's worth a shot. We'll send

124
00:07:48,365 --> 00:07:51,845
Speaker 5:  that email at the end of the show. I mean I agree with that. I also think

125
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:54,365
Speaker 5:  they did think the fight would be over sooner. I assume that Epic thought

126
00:07:54,365 --> 00:07:58,125
Speaker 5:  they would win faster than they did and it only is because

127
00:07:58,135 --> 00:08:02,005
Speaker 5:  Apple was so non-compliant for so long that they've gotten to this

128
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:05,205
Speaker 5:  resounding victory. I do agree that the toothpaste is outta too, if Apple

129
00:08:05,565 --> 00:08:09,485
Speaker 5:  succeeds in this appeal and they borrow links again,

130
00:08:09,595 --> 00:08:13,525
Speaker 5:  well it turns out now there's a lot of data about

131
00:08:13,705 --> 00:08:17,165
Speaker 5:  how much money was going to Apple instead of the app developers that different

132
00:08:18,005 --> 00:08:20,965
Speaker 5:  countries and regulators around the world can all look at. Right. And it

133
00:08:20,965 --> 00:08:23,365
Speaker 5:  that's gonna be the case in the eu. It's the case in Japan. It's like all

134
00:08:23,365 --> 00:08:27,285
Speaker 5:  over the place. We're running this big AB test and the data shows,

135
00:08:27,865 --> 00:08:31,125
Speaker 5:  oh Apple kept a lot of money that could have gone to developers and and created

136
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:31,525
Speaker 5:  jobs and

137
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:34,125
Speaker 7:  All this stuff. Right? And now like the Amazons and the Spotifys of the world

138
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,845
Speaker 7:  will have the other data that says look how much money.

139
00:08:37,395 --> 00:08:40,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And that this is just a big deal. The reason I bring this up ahead

140
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:44,205
Speaker 5:  of WWC preview conversation is this is the

141
00:08:44,205 --> 00:08:47,045
Speaker 5:  developer conference. This is where Apple says, look at all these new capabilities

142
00:08:47,065 --> 00:08:50,645
Speaker 5:  of our next generation operating systems. Can't you get excited?

143
00:08:51,015 --> 00:08:54,165
Speaker 5:  Won't you get excited about building your apps using our new APIs and features

144
00:08:54,165 --> 00:08:57,165
Speaker 5:  and hooks and like look at all the cool new stuff you can do on the iPhone.

145
00:08:57,595 --> 00:09:01,125
Speaker 5:  This is why it's worth paying us 30% of every in-app purchase

146
00:09:01,235 --> 00:09:05,205
Speaker 5:  because our operating system is better developers and I think they're

147
00:09:05,205 --> 00:09:08,605
Speaker 5:  coming into this totally on their back foot with developers who are by and

148
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:12,565
Speaker 5:  large unhappy who are already starting new kinds of

149
00:09:13,405 --> 00:09:16,885
Speaker 5:  companies and organizations to manage payments differently. Right? You're

150
00:09:16,885 --> 00:09:20,685
Speaker 5:  you're seeing like an alternative payment ecosystem develop who are pretty

151
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:24,405
Speaker 5:  annoyed about the AI stuff, right? Like the energy is elsewhere in

152
00:09:24,585 --> 00:09:28,485
Speaker 5:  AI and who are also just like we are tired of this company, this heel turn

153
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:32,365
Speaker 5:  that Apple is doing saying we're definitely gonna yell at everyone

154
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:36,085
Speaker 5:  and we have all these emails from inside of Apple basically being like, how

155
00:09:36,085 --> 00:09:38,965
Speaker 5:  do we squeeze our developers from these court cases? And I just think it's

156
00:09:38,965 --> 00:09:42,245
Speaker 5:  a weird spot for Apple to begin this developer conference season.

157
00:09:42,805 --> 00:09:46,635
Speaker 7:  I agree. And I think the tide is turned for Apple not

158
00:09:46,635 --> 00:09:50,275
Speaker 7:  only in the space of the developers and the

159
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:54,115
Speaker 7:  30% and the 70% and all of the the money, but also just in terms of

160
00:09:54,115 --> 00:09:56,915
Speaker 7:  the fanfare for the company and the product. Which

161
00:09:57,895 --> 00:10:01,875
Speaker 7:  as we all have gone to these conferences for, I don't know, 150 years

162
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,435
Speaker 7:  now. Like there's the excitement there. Not only about like, oh I'm gonna

163
00:10:05,435 --> 00:10:08,155
Speaker 7:  build this app, it's just like I'm excited about Apple, right? Like people

164
00:10:08,155 --> 00:10:11,955
Speaker 7:  are just excited about the devices, they're excited about the software and

165
00:10:12,015 --> 00:10:15,355
Speaker 7:  to your point, like they're very, right now there's this big shift towards

166
00:10:15,445 --> 00:10:19,235
Speaker 7:  these AI platforms. What can we do with ai? And Apple's been outta that

167
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:22,875
Speaker 7:  conversation. I know you guys have been discussing on the podcast too, like

168
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:26,475
Speaker 7:  the I'VE and Altman partnership. I mean there's, there's this

169
00:10:27,035 --> 00:10:30,395
Speaker 7:  appetite and excitement for something else right now

170
00:10:30,815 --> 00:10:33,715
Speaker 7:  and it's not Apple that seems to be delivering it. Yeah.

171
00:10:33,735 --> 00:10:37,405
Speaker 6:  And Apple's on this kind of sneakily

172
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:41,125
Speaker 6:  bad run recently of a mix of

173
00:10:41,835 --> 00:10:45,325
Speaker 6:  launching things with incredible fanfare that it claims are going to be the

174
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:49,085
Speaker 6:  next big thing that either aren't or don't exist at all. And So I think

175
00:10:49,355 --> 00:10:52,885
Speaker 6:  like I think about the, we, we've always talked about WWC differently than

176
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:56,805
Speaker 6:  some of the other ones and like the, the wrap on Google for a long time

177
00:10:56,805 --> 00:11:00,445
Speaker 6:  was we would go to Google io and they would show us science projects and

178
00:11:00,445 --> 00:11:04,325
Speaker 6:  then we would go to WWC and they would show us products and they were

179
00:11:04,325 --> 00:11:07,725
Speaker 6:  like, apple was unusually clear at

180
00:11:07,915 --> 00:11:11,005
Speaker 6:  showing things that were finished that were going to ship, that you were

181
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:14,845
Speaker 6:  going to use. And we've had a bad run of that with

182
00:11:14,845 --> 00:11:18,365
Speaker 6:  all of the, there's been the CarPlay stuff that lingered a long time and

183
00:11:18,365 --> 00:11:21,845
Speaker 6:  then changed and got weird Siri, which is the

184
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:25,765
Speaker 6:  biggest story of this year's WWDC because

185
00:11:25,845 --> 00:11:29,605
Speaker 6:  I would bet you $500 it's just not gonna be there. Nope. Nope.

186
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:33,565
Speaker 6:  Is now a year old and we have not seen one lick of what

187
00:11:33,565 --> 00:11:36,245
Speaker 6:  it's supposed to be. Then throw in the Vision Pro, which was supposed to

188
00:11:36,245 --> 00:11:38,245
Speaker 6:  be the next big thing that was gonna change Ruby's mind that hasn't really

189
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:41,365
Speaker 6:  worked. There's just this sense of like, I think

190
00:11:42,275 --> 00:11:46,125
Speaker 6:  WWDC was sort of the year Apple like set agendas for a long time

191
00:11:46,825 --> 00:11:50,365
Speaker 6:  and it really doesn't feel like that is what's coming anymore.

192
00:11:50,705 --> 00:11:51,965
Speaker 6:  And it's a very strange shift.

193
00:11:52,305 --> 00:11:55,445
Speaker 5:  And I would add to that, they set design agendas for the year, right? 'cause

194
00:11:55,445 --> 00:11:58,685
Speaker 5:  they would show you app designs and new features and new modes of interactions

195
00:11:58,705 --> 00:12:02,525
Speaker 5:  and animation flourishes and all this stuff. And everyone would copy it.

196
00:12:02,825 --> 00:12:05,845
Speaker 5:  And I, I don't know, we, you know, we're hearing that there's gonna be a

197
00:12:05,845 --> 00:12:09,565
Speaker 5:  big redesign of all their operating systems this year. We've, we, and I think

198
00:12:09,565 --> 00:12:12,805
Speaker 5:  Greg Jaw tweeted some joke about the word sleek,

199
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:14,555
Speaker 5:  right? Like it's coming.

200
00:12:14,785 --> 00:12:18,395
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And they sent it out in an email like a sleek, it's like a s

201
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:19,195
Speaker 7:  sleek

202
00:12:19,225 --> 00:12:21,275
Speaker 5:  Peak. And those are the invites, right?

203
00:12:21,385 --> 00:12:22,875
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I don't, I I didn't like that

204
00:12:22,985 --> 00:12:26,875
Speaker 5:  They're hinting that there's gonna be some some big visual redesign. And

205
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:30,555
Speaker 5:  it's fascinating because they're diverging from the rest of the

206
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:34,195
Speaker 5:  industry and I'm not sure the rest of the industry is gonna follow them into

207
00:12:34,195 --> 00:12:38,075
Speaker 5:  their like glass based redesign language. Maybe. Maybe they

208
00:12:38,075 --> 00:12:41,115
Speaker 5:  will. People tend to copy Apple quite a bit. But you can just see the rest

209
00:12:41,115 --> 00:12:44,515
Speaker 5:  of the industry is kind of headed back towards Dimorphism, which is wild

210
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:49,285
Speaker 5:  and like weird. That's just weird. You know, like, like even

211
00:12:49,445 --> 00:12:52,005
Speaker 5:  Apple not as design leader is truly novel.

212
00:12:52,345 --> 00:12:55,685
Speaker 7:  But I actually think, I mean, we'll we will learn about this and I, I keep

213
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:59,285
Speaker 7:  having like a little bit of this nightmare that it, that it launches in September.

214
00:12:59,635 --> 00:13:03,445
Speaker 7:  That operating cell operating system itself like looks great

215
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,565
Speaker 7:  and you know, hopefully works, fingers crossed everything sort of works.

216
00:13:06,665 --> 00:13:10,485
Speaker 7:  We don't have this buggy situation but then the apps are in just

217
00:13:10,485 --> 00:13:14,125
Speaker 7:  look completely different. I mean we had this with with when the iPhone 10

218
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:17,645
Speaker 7:  came out, right? There was like that gap in time that the apps had to catch

219
00:13:17,645 --> 00:13:21,205
Speaker 7:  up and it looked like garbage on the phone. You remember that time that like,

220
00:13:21,725 --> 00:13:24,965
Speaker 7:  I don't know, it was probably like six months, right? Where the app developers

221
00:13:24,965 --> 00:13:28,365
Speaker 7:  had to update for the update with like the no home button design and all

222
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:32,005
Speaker 7:  that. It's like kind of like cringed at the apps that didn't have the update.

223
00:13:32,585 --> 00:13:36,125
Speaker 7:  Oh yeah. Like there's a possibility that some of these developers don't get

224
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,365
Speaker 7:  on board or they don't get on board right away because they're put their

225
00:13:38,605 --> 00:13:41,405
Speaker 7:  resources into something else. But I'm sure we're gonna hear a lot about

226
00:13:41,425 --> 00:13:45,325
Speaker 7:  how easy It is to do x, y and z. I mean two

227
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,725
Speaker 7:  clicks, an X code, all of those types of things. Yeah.

228
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:50,965
Speaker 6:  But it does seem like, to that point, I I like, this is another thing where

229
00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:54,285
Speaker 6:  it's gonna be an interesting test for Apple because again, it has spent the

230
00:13:54,285 --> 00:13:58,165
Speaker 6:  last few years just pissing off developers left and right

231
00:13:58,165 --> 00:14:00,645
Speaker 6:  and essentially telling developers that they don't matter, that apple's in

232
00:14:00,645 --> 00:14:04,525
Speaker 6:  charge, that it can do whatever it wants. And then also asking

233
00:14:04,525 --> 00:14:08,485
Speaker 6:  developers to do more all the time. And I think this is the

234
00:14:08,485 --> 00:14:12,085
Speaker 6:  thing I've heard a lot from folks over the last year or so is this question

235
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:15,725
Speaker 6:  of, okay, I'm being asked to make a really great iOS app

236
00:14:16,345 --> 00:14:20,245
Speaker 6:  and last year it was all of the new like color tinting and all

237
00:14:20,245 --> 00:14:23,325
Speaker 6:  the the dark mode stuff. And so they're like, okay, well now I have to rethink

238
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:25,645
Speaker 6:  the way that my widgets work and the way that my home screen stuff works

239
00:14:25,785 --> 00:14:28,285
Speaker 6:  and there's the new control center stuff and there's the new lock screen

240
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:31,325
Speaker 6:  stuff. So I have to build this whole new controls thing, but then there's

241
00:14:31,355 --> 00:14:35,205
Speaker 6:  also all of this new stuff being done so that I can port my iOS

242
00:14:35,205 --> 00:14:38,285
Speaker 6:  app to other platforms, which is extra work that I have to do. And now Apple

243
00:14:38,285 --> 00:14:41,365
Speaker 6:  also really wants me to build an app for the Vision Pro. And it's like if

244
00:14:41,365 --> 00:14:45,265
Speaker 6:  you're Netflix, you can like figure out how to make apps for

245
00:14:45,295 --> 00:14:49,065
Speaker 6:  lots of platforms. But if you're like one person or a small

246
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:52,925
Speaker 6:  team of developers, which is most of the apps in the app store, that's

247
00:14:53,005 --> 00:14:55,725
Speaker 6:  a giant amount of work to give people. So

248
00:14:55,725 --> 00:14:58,605
Speaker 5:  What's fascinating about that is how did that, how did that problem get solved

249
00:14:58,635 --> 00:15:02,045
Speaker 5:  most often is they started using web frameworks to do all that stuff. Yeah.

250
00:15:02,045 --> 00:15:05,045
Speaker 5:  To get the app logic in more places. And then you can just skin the sort

251
00:15:05,045 --> 00:15:08,405
Speaker 5:  of app logic in the web framework. And so many apps now are just like,

252
00:15:08,795 --> 00:15:12,645
Speaker 5:  like web apps and wrappers, which is fine and great and fascinating but it

253
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,965
Speaker 5:  means all the actions on the web. Yeah. And that's where all of the AI apps

254
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:18,965
Speaker 5:  are being developed. Like fundamentally all of the best AI apps are starting

255
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:22,205
Speaker 5:  as deployed on the web because you know the backend is in the, in the cloud

256
00:15:22,205 --> 00:15:22,925
Speaker 5:  anyway. Right.

257
00:15:22,935 --> 00:15:26,205
Speaker 7:  Which you talked about with Sundar in your interview, which was really fascinating

258
00:15:26,205 --> 00:15:29,845
Speaker 7:  to me. Like that's where people are going to launch their, their apps.

259
00:15:30,285 --> 00:15:34,165
Speaker 5:  I Sendar said that he had vibe coded in Rept and the CEO Rept

260
00:15:34,165 --> 00:15:36,965
Speaker 5:  clipped that and he got a million views and he's just the happiest.

261
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:41,805
Speaker 7:  I was actually just thinking like maybe we should just show up to WWDC as

262
00:15:41,805 --> 00:15:44,285
Speaker 7:  developers and just be like, now I'm a vibe coder. Now I'm gonna say with

263
00:15:44,285 --> 00:15:44,725
Speaker 7:  the developers

264
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:49,805
Speaker 5:  I watch a lot of tiktoks of people one shot coding iOS apps. Right?

265
00:15:49,805 --> 00:15:52,605
Speaker 5:  It's just like, here It is. And I don't know if that's good or bad. I just,

266
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,685
Speaker 5:  I know that the action isn't on Apple's platforms, right? The action of where's,

267
00:15:56,685 --> 00:16:00,005
Speaker 5:  where's my app being first developed? It's kind of on the web and that is

268
00:16:00,245 --> 00:16:02,725
Speaker 5:  remarkable. I I continue to think the web is remarkable but it just means

269
00:16:03,385 --> 00:16:07,365
Speaker 5:  the part where you make it pretty for iOS is like

270
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:11,045
Speaker 5:  not important a second order phenomenon. And it used to just be the, the

271
00:16:11,045 --> 00:16:14,645
Speaker 5:  first thing it used the first order bit was like, do I have a great

272
00:16:14,825 --> 00:16:16,205
Speaker 5:  iOS app? 'cause that's how I make all the money.

273
00:16:16,355 --> 00:16:19,965
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I mean there are, there are legions of Android apps that are just

274
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:24,365
Speaker 6:  iOS apps. Like that's it because Apple was able to

275
00:16:24,515 --> 00:16:28,405
Speaker 6:  lead that for so long, right? That it was, the assumption was that your

276
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:31,365
Speaker 6:  Apple version of your app was going to be the best one and then you would,

277
00:16:31,385 --> 00:16:34,525
Speaker 6:  you would scale that in whatever way you needed to off to other platforms.

278
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,245
Speaker 6:  And like to your point about Apple sort of skating in the other direction

279
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:40,685
Speaker 6:  from all these companies, like that's a big swing because if you're not leading

280
00:16:40,905 --> 00:16:44,845
Speaker 6:  now it's gonna feel bad. And it's like there, there

281
00:16:44,845 --> 00:16:48,525
Speaker 6:  is a real perception that like people with great taste use

282
00:16:48,935 --> 00:16:52,565
Speaker 6:  Apple products because they are cohesive and you can lose that really quickly.

283
00:16:53,075 --> 00:16:57,005
Speaker 7:  I'll make a bet here. And I think again in our 150 years of going

284
00:16:57,005 --> 00:17:00,885
Speaker 7:  to WWC, we know that Tim Cook usually opens talking

285
00:17:00,985 --> 00:17:04,485
Speaker 7:  to the developers and like highlighting how much money they made for them,

286
00:17:04,615 --> 00:17:08,565
Speaker 7:  right? Like so to play the other side of this, like Apple still makes

287
00:17:08,565 --> 00:17:12,485
Speaker 7:  a lot of money for these developers probably the most. And so

288
00:17:12,515 --> 00:17:15,935
Speaker 7:  they'll lean into that. People aren't gonna go anywhere.

289
00:17:16,345 --> 00:17:20,215
Speaker 7:  Maybe they won't update as quickly, but Tim Cook will still be up there

290
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:22,295
Speaker 7:  talking about how much money he made for developers,

291
00:17:22,425 --> 00:17:22,775
Speaker 6:  Right?

292
00:17:23,135 --> 00:17:25,415
Speaker 5:  I know they're gonna do that 'cause Apple keeps putting out press releases

293
00:17:25,415 --> 00:17:27,015
Speaker 5:  saying how much money they put out for they made for

294
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:29,095
Speaker 7:  Developers. Okay, so there's no bet here because we all agree.

295
00:17:29,175 --> 00:17:31,855
Speaker 5:  I mean like literally today they're like, look at how big the global app

296
00:17:31,855 --> 00:17:35,655
Speaker 5:  store ecosystem is, right? And the answer is $1.3 trillion in

297
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:39,415
Speaker 5:  developer buildings and sales. That's gonna be on a what 90% of

298
00:17:39,415 --> 00:17:42,615
Speaker 5:  billings and sales went to developers with no commission paid Apple. These

299
00:17:42,615 --> 00:17:45,615
Speaker 5:  are the first two bullet points. What are they trying to point out, right?

300
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:48,575
Speaker 5:  They're like, we don't take any money from, look at all this money we didn't

301
00:17:48,575 --> 00:17:52,405
Speaker 5:  take. And it's like, well the 10% you did take is still a huge amount

302
00:17:52,425 --> 00:17:55,445
Speaker 5:  of money, right? Like, I dunno what to tell you.

303
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:57,845
Speaker 7:  Yeah. That's gonna be the slide. That's like one of the first slides. You're

304
00:17:57,845 --> 00:17:58,445
Speaker 7:  right. Yeah.

305
00:17:58,505 --> 00:18:01,165
Speaker 5:  And so you can just see that they're, they're trying to make the case, they're

306
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:04,805
Speaker 5:  providing all this value. I wanted to start there. Not to just be

307
00:18:05,045 --> 00:18:08,805
Speaker 5:  negative, but to point out this is the context. Like the audience

308
00:18:09,265 --> 00:18:13,205
Speaker 5:  at WWC is developers who are feeling these pressures.

309
00:18:13,785 --> 00:18:17,765
Speaker 5:  The point of this conference is sometimes to launch a Mac Pro,

310
00:18:18,175 --> 00:18:21,925
Speaker 5:  right? And to get some flash of consumer recognition. And obviously Apple

311
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:25,565
Speaker 5:  has a lot of fans. But the point is to get developers excited

312
00:18:25,575 --> 00:18:29,045
Speaker 5:  about building for Apple's platforms as opposed to Microsoft or Google's

313
00:18:29,045 --> 00:18:33,005
Speaker 5:  or Open or whoever. And they're just in a weird spot. Like I

314
00:18:33,005 --> 00:18:36,805
Speaker 5:  think, I think that will be an undercurrent of this entire thing next

315
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:40,765
Speaker 5:  week that developers are, they need to be convinced in a

316
00:18:40,765 --> 00:18:42,925
Speaker 5:  way that hasn't been true of Apple in the bear a long time. I

317
00:18:42,925 --> 00:18:46,845
Speaker 6:  Do think though to Joanna's point there, there is a real, like, where

318
00:18:46,845 --> 00:18:49,925
Speaker 6:  else are you gonna go thing that Apple continues to have going for it.

319
00:18:50,865 --> 00:18:54,565
Speaker 6:  And this is again, like a lot of the, the sort of developer energy I hear

320
00:18:54,565 --> 00:18:58,365
Speaker 6:  around AI stuff is like, maybe that's the platform shift, right?

321
00:18:58,365 --> 00:19:00,685
Speaker 6:  It was like there was a minute where everybody was like, maybe we'll investigate

322
00:19:00,685 --> 00:19:03,725
Speaker 6:  the metaverse and then that wasn't it. And then everybody's like, is it Web3?

323
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,925
Speaker 6:  And they're like, no, that's not it. And now there is this sense that, okay,

324
00:19:06,925 --> 00:19:10,845
Speaker 6:  maybe AI is the thing that I can, I can build something

325
00:19:10,955 --> 00:19:14,885
Speaker 6:  into that will not come with all of the problems and restrictions of

326
00:19:15,145 --> 00:19:18,845
Speaker 6:  iOS. But like the, the people who have been making iOS apps for

327
00:19:18,865 --> 00:19:22,805
Speaker 6:  20 years and are really pissed at Apple are gonna keep making iOS apps. And

328
00:19:22,805 --> 00:19:26,525
Speaker 6:  the problem is Apple knows that and is, is going to continue to

329
00:19:26,895 --> 00:19:30,205
Speaker 6:  bleed that fact and those developers for as long as It is able to,

330
00:19:30,515 --> 00:19:33,725
Speaker 5:  Well except they can't take the money from the web links anymore. So they

331
00:19:33,725 --> 00:19:34,165
Speaker 5:  have to fight.

332
00:19:34,665 --> 00:19:35,805
Speaker 6:  That's yeah. Right?

333
00:19:35,805 --> 00:19:39,605
Speaker 5:  Like this is the, this is the dynamic it this's, where else are you gonna

334
00:19:39,605 --> 00:19:43,425
Speaker 5:  go? And the answer is, well somewhere else, like there's,

335
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,265
Speaker 5:  I can go somewhere else Now. Have you considered that Tim?

336
00:19:46,565 --> 00:19:47,745
Speaker 6:  For that thing? For sure. Yeah.

337
00:19:47,885 --> 00:19:51,265
Speaker 5:  And but that's the money. Yeah. So I think that brings us the, the the operating

338
00:19:51,265 --> 00:19:54,745
Speaker 5:  system updates and, and, and a bit of the preview here. We're expecting some

339
00:19:54,745 --> 00:19:58,625
Speaker 5:  visual refresh across the operating systems. We are expecting

340
00:19:58,705 --> 00:20:02,345
Speaker 5:  'em to mention the Vision Pro, which continues to exist. Obstinately continues

341
00:20:02,345 --> 00:20:06,265
Speaker 5:  to exist. They're gonna rename them all to, you know, iOS 26

342
00:20:06,465 --> 00:20:09,305
Speaker 5:  wherever in any year thing. Then there's like, wait, actually

343
00:20:09,305 --> 00:20:10,345
Speaker 7:  Wait, can we, can we talk about that,

344
00:20:10,495 --> 00:20:12,745
Speaker 6:  That Joanna, I wanna know how you feel about this. We've talked a lot about

345
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:16,065
Speaker 6:  this on this show, but you are a person who cares deeply about version numbers.

346
00:20:16,665 --> 00:20:20,585
Speaker 7:  I care a lot about this. I have a lot of thoughts. I tweeted this. Okay,

347
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:24,705
Speaker 7:  first of all I get the year thing, but It is

348
00:20:24,705 --> 00:20:28,505
Speaker 7:  2025 right now. This is what I said, said there are still a number of months

349
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:33,065
Speaker 7:  where we have to process that. And I'm still writing 2024

350
00:20:33,325 --> 00:20:34,145
Speaker 7:  on my checks.

351
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,145
Speaker 5:  Oh my God. Yes. Well how many checks

352
00:20:36,205 --> 00:20:39,105
Speaker 7:  Are you writing? Yes, I write checks. I knew you were gonna ask that and

353
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:40,345
Speaker 7:  I would like to talk about my checks.

354
00:20:40,535 --> 00:20:42,625
Speaker 5:  This is what happens when you work at a print newspaper run by

355
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:46,145
Speaker 7:  Report. No, it isn't what happens when we're in a print newspaper. It's what

356
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:49,485
Speaker 7:  happens when you have an accountant who is old school and will only take

357
00:20:49,485 --> 00:20:53,125
Speaker 7:  checks. It's when you have a lighting guy for your house and he

358
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:54,725
Speaker 7:  only takes checks. Your guy

359
00:20:54,725 --> 00:20:57,245
Speaker 5:  Doesn't want you to pay him on Zelle under the table. This I've learned that

360
00:20:57,245 --> 00:20:57,925
Speaker 5:  this is zealous for

361
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,805
Speaker 7:  I do so much. I do so much Zelle under the table. I mean I don't if you're

362
00:21:01,805 --> 00:21:05,525
Speaker 7:  listening to this, someone who's trying to audit all the

363
00:21:05,685 --> 00:21:09,645
Speaker 7:  people I pay for things, for houses stuff. Yeah. So much

364
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:13,315
Speaker 7:  Zelle. Anyway, I still write some checks. Okay.

365
00:21:13,495 --> 00:21:16,755
Speaker 7:  It happens. Yeah. Mostly for house stuff.

366
00:21:17,465 --> 00:21:19,355
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it seems, yeah. Zelle under the table though. I feel

367
00:21:19,355 --> 00:21:22,475
Speaker 7:  Like I need a spin off of the birch cast, which is just about my house and

368
00:21:22,575 --> 00:21:23,715
Speaker 7:  things that do, would do my

369
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,995
Speaker 5:  House would show with you. We can stop this right now if you just wanna talk

370
00:21:25,995 --> 00:21:26,355
Speaker 5:  about your house.

371
00:21:27,335 --> 00:21:30,395
Speaker 7:  We did the garage. That was a great hit. I feel like that was

372
00:21:30,395 --> 00:21:32,715
Speaker 6:  A great day. We still get emails about the garage and I delete them before

373
00:21:32,715 --> 00:21:33,555
Speaker 6:  Neil. I can see them.

374
00:21:34,155 --> 00:21:37,075
Speaker 7:  I know we had, you know, we did, we did a postmortem on that. I think there

375
00:21:37,075 --> 00:21:39,155
Speaker 7:  were ways we could have done it better, but we'll, we'll work on that for

376
00:21:39,155 --> 00:21:42,955
Speaker 7:  our next project anyway. I'm worried about the year thing.

377
00:21:43,105 --> 00:21:46,655
Speaker 7:  I'll get over that. It's also so many numbers. My annual

378
00:21:46,655 --> 00:21:50,375
Speaker 7:  tradition is to do the number of tips to correspond to the iOS version. And

379
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:54,335
Speaker 7:  so there's just no way. I think physically I can do 26 tips for iOS

380
00:21:54,335 --> 00:21:54,735
Speaker 7:  26.

381
00:21:55,155 --> 00:21:56,255
Speaker 5:  Oh this is your problem.

382
00:21:56,395 --> 00:22:00,335
Speaker 7:  You're in trouble. I'm, I'm gonna try, I, there's, I'm I I'm up for the

383
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:04,215
Speaker 7:  task. I'm not too old to do it. I think I can, I

384
00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:06,815
Speaker 7:  can overcome but that's a lot of tips to do.

385
00:22:07,115 --> 00:22:09,335
Speaker 5:  It is a lot. They they jumped you by like eight. Yeah,

386
00:22:10,035 --> 00:22:13,895
Speaker 6:  It is. It's gonna get into like new formatting tricks in Apple notes

387
00:22:14,295 --> 00:22:17,255
Speaker 6:  and it's like it's gonna be at the bottom where, but what I, my challenge

388
00:22:17,255 --> 00:22:20,895
Speaker 6:  to you Joanna is, is to do 26 tips Fort VOS

389
00:22:20,995 --> 00:22:24,175
Speaker 6:  26. That's the one. If you can do that

390
00:22:24,935 --> 00:22:27,515
Speaker 6:  26, you deserve all 8,000 square feet of your

391
00:22:27,515 --> 00:22:28,835
Speaker 7:  Office for all 26 viewers.

392
00:22:29,435 --> 00:22:29,595
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

393
00:22:29,595 --> 00:22:29,875
Speaker 7:  Exactly.

394
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:33,395
Speaker 5:  Listen, this is what chat GBT is for.

395
00:22:35,075 --> 00:22:37,315
Speaker 5:  I need eight more tips buddy. Get out there.

396
00:22:37,495 --> 00:22:40,515
Speaker 7:  You know, chat GBT tends to be wrong on the tips. They'll be like you need

397
00:22:40,515 --> 00:22:42,835
Speaker 7:  to adjust this settings menu and this. And it's like that doesn't exist.

398
00:22:43,305 --> 00:22:44,555
Speaker 7:  Okay. I've tried it.

399
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:47,315
Speaker 5:  That's the foundational stuff. And obviously Joanna is very annoyed 'cause

400
00:22:47,315 --> 00:22:51,235
Speaker 5:  she has to do slightly more work than last year. Great. We should talk

401
00:22:51,235 --> 00:22:53,995
Speaker 5:  about the actual features. Here's the thing that I'm most interested in,

402
00:22:54,055 --> 00:22:57,995
Speaker 5:  in the context of making developers excited. The, everyone has an

403
00:22:57,995 --> 00:23:01,395
Speaker 5:  incredible past process, right? It's the, It is the best mobile processor

404
00:23:01,395 --> 00:23:04,435
Speaker 5:  on a phone. Qualcomm is caught up in some ways. I'm sure we'll get some emails

405
00:23:04,485 --> 00:23:07,355
Speaker 5:  about someone's Nvidia shield that they're powering with the USB battery

406
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:11,315
Speaker 5:  pack or whatever. Like it's all happening, it's great, but they've got

407
00:23:11,315 --> 00:23:14,795
Speaker 5:  the neural engine, they've got a best in class mobile processor. They can

408
00:23:14,855 --> 00:23:16,195
Speaker 5:  run local models.

409
00:23:18,095 --> 00:23:21,555
Speaker 5:  Do you think that they're gonna find a way to tell developers like just do

410
00:23:21,555 --> 00:23:25,475
Speaker 5:  the AI stuff here instead of on Azure using an

411
00:23:25,475 --> 00:23:29,295
Speaker 5:  open AI model. Like, 'cause that is the game, right? Where

412
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:33,135
Speaker 5:  your AI app logic is running right now is gonna tell

413
00:23:33,135 --> 00:23:37,095
Speaker 5:  us a lot about the future of this industry writ large. And Apple

414
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:40,695
Speaker 5:  hasn't made a big play for, well actually a bunch of the stuff you wanna

415
00:23:40,695 --> 00:23:43,255
Speaker 5:  do, you can do locally on the phone because we have the processors to do

416
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,565
Speaker 5:  it and all of the built for Apple intelligence stuff came to nothing.

417
00:23:47,185 --> 00:23:49,965
Speaker 5:  But if they actually did build the phone for Apple Intelligence, well maybe

418
00:23:49,965 --> 00:23:53,645
Speaker 5:  they built the phone to run some models that are useful for app developers

419
00:23:54,145 --> 00:23:58,045
Speaker 7:  And private cloud compute, which like, I think they'll want to keep selling.

420
00:23:58,045 --> 00:24:01,565
Speaker 7:  They obviously put a lot of investment we think into that. So

421
00:24:02,205 --> 00:24:05,765
Speaker 7:  I think that that's like one way they get into the AI story this year

422
00:24:05,765 --> 00:24:09,605
Speaker 7:  without getting into Apple intelligence, right? Like to all of our

423
00:24:09,605 --> 00:24:12,605
Speaker 7:  conversation about the developers, they try to say, Hey, we are gonna give

424
00:24:12,605 --> 00:24:16,125
Speaker 7:  you access to small language models that run on device. We're gonna give

425
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:20,005
Speaker 7:  you large language model access and private cloud compute and you can build

426
00:24:20,005 --> 00:24:22,805
Speaker 7:  great things. We don't even know what you're gonna build. You go, go build

427
00:24:22,805 --> 00:24:26,535
Speaker 7:  it. My issue there and like, you know, it's like are the models

428
00:24:26,755 --> 00:24:27,215
Speaker 7:  any good,

429
00:24:27,845 --> 00:24:30,895
Speaker 5:  Good is a, has a relationship to cost.

430
00:24:31,635 --> 00:24:34,615
Speaker 5:  So if the model on the phone is like kind of crappy, but it's free to use,

431
00:24:35,485 --> 00:24:38,615
Speaker 5:  it's fine. You know, like, right. I I think that that's the case for them

432
00:24:38,615 --> 00:24:42,535
Speaker 5:  to make. 'cause I don't think that they can run a GPT-4 class model

433
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:46,115
Speaker 5:  on private cloud compute right now. I maybe they will. Maybe that's what

434
00:24:46,115 --> 00:24:48,755
Speaker 5:  they're gonna announce. But like that's your problem if you, if you want

435
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:52,555
Speaker 5:  that thing, you gotta go pay open AI or you gotta pay Google for

436
00:24:52,555 --> 00:24:56,475
Speaker 5:  Gemini or whoever. Like you got that class of model exists on someone else's

437
00:24:56,475 --> 00:24:57,235
Speaker 5:  data centers right now.

438
00:24:57,455 --> 00:25:00,675
Speaker 7:  But even like just all of our complaints that we probably have about Apple

439
00:25:00,675 --> 00:25:04,475
Speaker 7:  intelligence, the issues are largely because the models just don't feel

440
00:25:04,475 --> 00:25:08,195
Speaker 7:  that smart. Right? Yeah. Like you even just take the, you know, the

441
00:25:08,195 --> 00:25:11,915
Speaker 7:  image editing, right? Where you're, you wanna get something out of the background

442
00:25:12,265 --> 00:25:16,235
Speaker 7:  like that is not as good as what you see from a Google level type

443
00:25:16,235 --> 00:25:16,315
Speaker 7:  of

444
00:25:18,325 --> 00:25:21,795
Speaker 7:  experience or model or whatever. Take summaries and

445
00:25:21,795 --> 00:25:25,635
Speaker 7:  notifications. Those summaries make very little sense and

446
00:25:25,735 --> 00:25:29,555
Speaker 7:  to the point where most people have turned them off. Like yeah, that's the

447
00:25:29,555 --> 00:25:32,795
Speaker 7:  intelligence. And so if the intelligence that they're going to give access

448
00:25:32,795 --> 00:25:35,675
Speaker 7:  to isn't actually all that intelligent, I'm not sure what the sale, the sale

449
00:25:35,675 --> 00:25:35,875
Speaker 7:  is

450
00:25:36,645 --> 00:25:40,635
Speaker 6:  Cheap. It's, it's really interesting 'cause in theory if Apple were good

451
00:25:40,635 --> 00:25:44,515
Speaker 6:  at this, It is actually like perfectly positioned to do this

452
00:25:44,515 --> 00:25:47,875
Speaker 6:  in a really cool and coherent way where like, like you said, it has

453
00:25:48,825 --> 00:25:52,075
Speaker 6:  more stuff to work with locally than almost anybody. And, and there are

454
00:25:52,955 --> 00:25:56,755
Speaker 6:  a lot of good and useful things you can do on your phone with local AI

455
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:59,315
Speaker 6:  models, right? Like it solves a lot of search problems. It solves a lot of

456
00:25:59,315 --> 00:26:03,075
Speaker 6:  like how do I do small things on my phone? Like what if it made timers faster?

457
00:26:03,265 --> 00:26:05,115
Speaker 6:  Like there's just a lot of things you could do.

458
00:26:05,385 --> 00:26:08,475
Speaker 5:  Wait, David, can we just unpack what if it made timers faster? Yeah.

459
00:26:09,105 --> 00:26:10,835
Speaker 7:  Okay. I don't wanna cut you off. I was like, like transcription.

460
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:14,195
Speaker 5:  I sp up time. You're like these 30 seconds now goes by in 25.

461
00:26:14,495 --> 00:26:18,195
Speaker 6:  No, I'm talking about the, the gap between me saying timer and the timer

462
00:26:18,195 --> 00:26:22,155
Speaker 6:  stuff. Oh, I see. Okay. Like there, there have been these moments with

463
00:26:22,265 --> 00:26:25,315
Speaker 6:  Siri in particular in the past where they, they took a thing that had to

464
00:26:25,315 --> 00:26:28,115
Speaker 6:  go to the cloud and they made it run on the device and it immediately feels

465
00:26:28,115 --> 00:26:28,915
Speaker 6:  better. So I,

466
00:26:29,775 --> 00:26:32,995
Speaker 5:  All three of us are parents and we've often all made pasta and it's like

467
00:26:32,995 --> 00:26:35,715
Speaker 5:  if I could get this done in six minutes instead of nine we're my god gold,

468
00:26:35,815 --> 00:26:36,115
Speaker 5:  you know,

469
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:38,195
Speaker 6:  I would buy every iPhone. The

470
00:26:38,195 --> 00:26:39,955
Speaker 5:  Power of Apple intelligence bap

471
00:26:39,955 --> 00:26:43,285
Speaker 7:  Times just gets going from like 10 minutes to two and you're like, it's 10

472
00:26:43,285 --> 00:26:44,165
Speaker 7:  minutes, I swear.

473
00:26:44,715 --> 00:26:47,445
Speaker 6:  Yeah we this's, we we just solved some things.

474
00:26:48,305 --> 00:26:50,405
Speaker 5:  Get on it Craig timers faster.

475
00:26:51,835 --> 00:26:54,005
Speaker 7:  Wait, what was that quote? It was like time is not a

476
00:26:54,115 --> 00:26:57,845
Speaker 5:  Trump's like head of like Yeah White House technology was like

477
00:26:58,265 --> 00:27:01,285
Speaker 5:  we can now travel through time and space. Yeah, that's And everyone's like,

478
00:27:01,285 --> 00:27:02,565
Speaker 5:  that's it. Are you sure

479
00:27:04,385 --> 00:27:06,605
Speaker 7:  That's it? That's exactly what I'm thinking of because, because

480
00:27:06,605 --> 00:27:08,565
Speaker 5:  I'm good on space. I know we can travel through space

481
00:27:09,255 --> 00:27:09,925
Speaker 6:  Doing that already. Very

482
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:10,565
Speaker 5:  Confused about time.

483
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,075
Speaker 7:  Sorry David, go on.

484
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:16,825
Speaker 6:  Well now I, we'll come back to that, that that's The Verge cast.

485
00:27:17,965 --> 00:27:21,385
Speaker 6:  But but you, you start with that and you, right and you have the, this sort

486
00:27:21,385 --> 00:27:25,345
Speaker 6:  of base layer of on device private stuff. Apple gets to tell its

487
00:27:25,345 --> 00:27:28,865
Speaker 6:  big story about privacy and all this stuff like that all works great. Then

488
00:27:28,865 --> 00:27:32,585
Speaker 6:  the second thing is the, is the private cloud compute stuff that

489
00:27:32,595 --> 00:27:36,465
Speaker 6:  Apple like by all accounts, the infrastructure for that is actually

490
00:27:36,465 --> 00:27:39,705
Speaker 6:  pretty good. We have not seen it do anything interesting but like as a, as

491
00:27:39,745 --> 00:27:43,665
Speaker 6:  a theory and a product, it seems to be pretty interesting to a lot of people.

492
00:27:44,445 --> 00:27:47,905
Speaker 6:  That's where you, you can do a lot of stuff and then for the most

493
00:27:48,595 --> 00:27:52,385
Speaker 6:  aggressive, impressive sort of needy stuff, you

494
00:27:52,385 --> 00:27:56,305
Speaker 6:  have this seamless integration out to tragedy pt. And one of the rumors this

495
00:27:56,305 --> 00:27:59,585
Speaker 6:  time is that they're gonna bring more partners into that. So you could, you

496
00:27:59,585 --> 00:28:02,425
Speaker 6:  could route to Gemini, you could route to Claude. Like you basically have

497
00:28:02,425 --> 00:28:06,305
Speaker 6:  this thing where you need your phone to do something and it

498
00:28:06,305 --> 00:28:09,865
Speaker 6:  has every available option to choose from, from fast

499
00:28:10,165 --> 00:28:13,665
Speaker 6:  to slow and from cheap to expensive. Right? That's very cool.

500
00:28:13,845 --> 00:28:17,745
Speaker 6:  Except that Apple sucks at this. And it's like, and there is

501
00:28:17,745 --> 00:28:21,625
Speaker 6:  just, it's so frustrating because like you, you can see the idea

502
00:28:21,675 --> 00:28:25,425
Speaker 6:  being right and the execution just being a disaster over and over and over

503
00:28:25,425 --> 00:28:28,945
Speaker 6:  again. And so with all of this, I do think one of the things Apple is gonna

504
00:28:28,965 --> 00:28:32,825
Speaker 6:  do is point some of the Apple intelligence stuff

505
00:28:33,405 --> 00:28:37,185
Speaker 6:  at developers as a bunch of APIs you could call, right? Yeah. That like it's,

506
00:28:37,185 --> 00:28:40,185
Speaker 6:  it's gonna bring them in as features but it's also I think gonna start to

507
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:43,825
Speaker 6:  give developers more access to the underlying

508
00:28:43,925 --> 00:28:47,665
Speaker 6:  models and technology. And that's again potentially

509
00:28:47,665 --> 00:28:50,545
Speaker 6:  really interesting. And It is, It is a very appley thing to do to be like,

510
00:28:50,545 --> 00:28:53,745
Speaker 6:  hey, you know, rewind all the way back and apple's like you don't have a

511
00:28:53,745 --> 00:28:56,105
Speaker 6:  phone with a camera that knows where you are. What do you wanna do with that?

512
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:58,625
Speaker 6:  And people found really interesting stuff to do with that because there's

513
00:28:58,745 --> 00:29:02,705
Speaker 6:  interesting stuff to do with that. But the product sucks. So

514
00:29:02,705 --> 00:29:05,865
Speaker 6:  it's like Apple's gonna be like, Hey here's a bad model that doesn't do anything.

515
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:08,665
Speaker 6:  Is this interesting to developers? And I think developers are just gonna

516
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:09,105
Speaker 6:  be like no.

517
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:13,345
Speaker 5:  Yeah. 'cause they can just go build on the cloud on G PT four

518
00:29:13,405 --> 00:29:17,185
Speaker 5:  or Gemini. Right. Or Claude or anything else. And that part to me is

519
00:29:17,665 --> 00:29:20,265
Speaker 5:  fascinating. 'cause the history, the reason Apple has all this clout with

520
00:29:20,265 --> 00:29:23,705
Speaker 5:  developers is 'cause you got a bunch of stuff in the eighties and nineties

521
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:27,505
Speaker 5:  developing for the Mac got you a bunch of stuff for free that like you had

522
00:29:27,505 --> 00:29:30,465
Speaker 5:  to basically hard code in the windows and then nothing was cohesive,

523
00:29:31,185 --> 00:29:34,095
Speaker 5:  right? So you got like proportional fonts. This was like Steve Jobs's favorite

524
00:29:34,095 --> 00:29:37,215
Speaker 5:  thing to talk about is heated proportional fonts and windows, proportional

525
00:29:37,305 --> 00:29:40,295
Speaker 5:  ponds and Windows proportional fonts were like really bad for a one time

526
00:29:41,105 --> 00:29:43,365
Speaker 5:  you got that stuff for free. So a bunch of developers like, oh I wanna make

527
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:46,885
Speaker 5:  beautiful stuff here. You can go on and on and on down the line all the way

528
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:50,645
Speaker 5:  to, on the iPhone you got iPhone's like theming

529
00:29:50,645 --> 00:29:54,245
Speaker 5:  toolkit for free. Yeah. Like they would upgrade to iOS seven and then everyone

530
00:29:54,245 --> 00:29:57,285
Speaker 5:  like ran to use iOS seven's design language and that was cool

531
00:29:58,035 --> 00:30:00,965
Speaker 5:  here the capability you're talking about, the thing you're supposed to get

532
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:04,205
Speaker 5:  for free is like, oh there's a bunch of AI on the phone that I can use and

533
00:30:04,205 --> 00:30:06,365
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna build the next class of application. And I think developers are

534
00:30:06,365 --> 00:30:10,245
Speaker 5:  like, yeah but I can just use Gemini in the web. Right? And then that that

535
00:30:10,245 --> 00:30:10,485
Speaker 5:  rules,

536
00:30:10,805 --> 00:30:14,685
Speaker 6:  I can get that from other places. Apple is by a mile not the best

537
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:17,885
Speaker 6:  provider of that stuff right now, even if you're building II apps.

538
00:30:18,425 --> 00:30:22,405
Speaker 5:  But they do, to your point, they do own the phone. So until someone displaces

539
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:24,405
Speaker 5:  the phone, I think do with something, they do have a little bit of where

540
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,605
Speaker 5:  you're gonna go. So we should go through the other features that are rumored,

541
00:30:28,105 --> 00:30:32,045
Speaker 5:  as David mentioned, more integrations with outside AI partners. I'm actually

542
00:30:32,045 --> 00:30:35,405
Speaker 5:  really looking for how they integrate Google Gemini. I think

543
00:30:35,955 --> 00:30:39,365
Speaker 5:  it's in, it's in both Apple and Google's interest to

544
00:30:40,035 --> 00:30:43,965
Speaker 5:  move the money from Google paying Apple for Google search to

545
00:30:43,965 --> 00:30:47,245
Speaker 5:  be the default in safari to something else. 'cause that is under

546
00:30:47,355 --> 00:30:51,085
Speaker 5:  antitrust pressure. You know, there's this stat about Google searches and

547
00:30:51,605 --> 00:30:55,245
Speaker 5:  safari falling anyway that Sundar basically doesn't want to talk about.

548
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:59,885
Speaker 5:  So if you move that money to a Gemini integration, interesting.

549
00:30:59,885 --> 00:31:03,445
Speaker 5:  Right? Maybe you escape the problem. We'll see. But I'm curious how that

550
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:04,045
Speaker 5:  plays out. Have

551
00:31:04,045 --> 00:31:07,765
Speaker 7:  You guys changed your search default on Safari No. To anything?

552
00:31:08,185 --> 00:31:10,005
Speaker 7:  Is it It still goes to Google. Yeah.

553
00:31:10,385 --> 00:31:12,765
Speaker 5:  No, I just added chat GBT to my action button.

554
00:31:13,035 --> 00:31:17,005
Speaker 7:  Okay. So I changed my safari search to chat

555
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:17,565
Speaker 7:  GPT

556
00:31:19,305 --> 00:31:23,085
Speaker 7:  and it's a really poor experience. Like chat

557
00:31:23,165 --> 00:31:27,125
Speaker 7:  GBT has this extension so it's there It is an extension. And So I

558
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:30,885
Speaker 7:  think there's a lot of potential for them to change that to tap into.

559
00:31:31,185 --> 00:31:33,885
Speaker 7:  And we know they're talking to perplexity, we know they're talking to these

560
00:31:33,885 --> 00:31:37,525
Speaker 7:  other companies, whether they do it as a default or you know, they could

561
00:31:37,525 --> 00:31:41,165
Speaker 7:  keep Google as a default 'cause we all, there's all that baggage. But

562
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:45,165
Speaker 7:  they could make it considerably easier for you to use the address bar in

563
00:31:45,285 --> 00:31:49,005
Speaker 7:  Safari to get to an AI Yeah. Chat bot. Which I would love to see.

564
00:31:50,795 --> 00:31:54,725
Speaker 7:  What I was gonna jump in and say is like the chat GBT integration with Siri

565
00:31:54,945 --> 00:31:55,965
Speaker 7:  is terrible. It's

566
00:31:55,965 --> 00:31:57,125
Speaker 5:  Awful. It's very bad. Yeah.

567
00:31:57,305 --> 00:32:00,565
Speaker 7:  So either they have to improve that considerably and

568
00:32:01,465 --> 00:32:05,245
Speaker 7:  add extra partners. Like if they do add an anthropic and they do add a Google

569
00:32:05,245 --> 00:32:08,445
Speaker 7:  there, like they say, you know what, just like we let you change your whatever

570
00:32:08,515 --> 00:32:12,245
Speaker 7:  default of whatever. Over the years they've given us more of those

571
00:32:12,245 --> 00:32:15,845
Speaker 7:  options. We'll let you change the default on the, you know, Siri will default

572
00:32:15,845 --> 00:32:19,605
Speaker 7:  to go to Claude or Gemini, but they have to

573
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:22,525
Speaker 7:  improve that experience because otherwise it's like no one, there's no benefit

574
00:32:22,665 --> 00:32:23,045
Speaker 7:  in it.

575
00:32:23,355 --> 00:32:27,045
Speaker 5:  Well the baggage you're describing to be clear is literal

576
00:32:27,235 --> 00:32:29,005
Speaker 5:  bags full of $20 billion.

577
00:32:29,945 --> 00:32:30,165
Speaker 7:  Yes.

578
00:32:30,735 --> 00:32:34,575
Speaker 5:  Right? So like they have to move that money, right? And

579
00:32:34,575 --> 00:32:38,265
Speaker 5:  to say to Google, okay, you were paying us to be the default search

580
00:32:38,465 --> 00:32:41,405
Speaker 5:  provider. We might change that to perplexity 'cause it's a better experience.

581
00:32:41,905 --> 00:32:45,725
Speaker 5:  We would still really like your $20 billion. Here's this other integration

582
00:32:46,105 --> 00:32:47,645
Speaker 7:  And that integration is the Siri.

583
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:51,285
Speaker 5:  I don't know the answer. I just, I, I suspect because there's antitrust pressure

584
00:32:51,385 --> 00:32:55,085
Speaker 5:  on the deals exist now they will find some other place to make

585
00:32:55,085 --> 00:32:58,885
Speaker 5:  Google and Gemini the default that lets them preserve

586
00:32:58,885 --> 00:32:59,765
Speaker 5:  $20 billion.

587
00:32:59,985 --> 00:33:03,765
Speaker 6:  But then while this is happening, you also have the DOJ pointing at that

588
00:33:03,765 --> 00:33:07,085
Speaker 6:  possibility going, we cannot allow that to happen. Right? Yeah. That that

589
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:10,605
Speaker 6:  is like, they're like we have to get this trial done now so that Google can't

590
00:33:10,605 --> 00:33:13,765
Speaker 6:  make this next deal with Apple the way that It is currently attempting to

591
00:33:13,765 --> 00:33:14,845
Speaker 6:  do with everybody. Yeah.

592
00:33:15,065 --> 00:33:18,405
Speaker 5:  But it's like, you know, I have, see I like the action button opening cha

593
00:33:18,405 --> 00:33:22,285
Speaker 5:  g bt, this is a very dumb example, but because we are, whenever Joan is on,

594
00:33:22,285 --> 00:33:25,445
Speaker 5:  we only talk about home repair. I hung up a light fixture yesterday and it

595
00:33:25,445 --> 00:33:29,405
Speaker 5:  had weird connectors for the LEDs inside and one of them broke and I hit

596
00:33:29,405 --> 00:33:31,325
Speaker 5:  the action button and I took a picture of the weird connector and I said,

597
00:33:31,325 --> 00:33:35,085
Speaker 5:  how do I fix this? And Cha GBT just told me how to pry up the little pin

598
00:33:35,085 --> 00:33:37,725
Speaker 5:  that was broken, re crimp it and stick it back in there and it was fixed.

599
00:33:37,985 --> 00:33:39,565
Speaker 5:  And I was like, oh this is very useful.

600
00:33:39,755 --> 00:33:42,645
Speaker 7:  Yeah, but you're not using Apple's visual intelligence to do that, which

601
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:43,205
Speaker 7:  could do it.

602
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:47,525
Speaker 5:  But, but I'm using Apple's button. Right? Right. It's like if Apple can get

603
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:51,085
Speaker 5:  $20 billion to set that button to Gemini instead of chat GBT we're like they're

604
00:33:51,085 --> 00:33:51,445
Speaker 5:  in business.

605
00:33:52,035 --> 00:33:55,845
Speaker 7:  Well and the visual intelligence taps into Google, so

606
00:33:55,895 --> 00:33:58,365
Speaker 7:  maybe that's another place. And we've heard about that I believe a little

607
00:33:58,365 --> 00:34:02,045
Speaker 7:  bit in the trial that that's another place that they're building that future

608
00:34:02,065 --> 00:34:02,805
Speaker 7:  of the relationship.

609
00:34:03,225 --> 00:34:06,805
Speaker 5:  So that's one aspect we're looking for those integrations and who will be

610
00:34:06,805 --> 00:34:09,245
Speaker 5:  the providers and who will be defaults. I'm very curious about that. The

611
00:34:09,245 --> 00:34:12,245
Speaker 5:  second one that's on the list is this idea that they're gonna redesign shortcuts

612
00:34:12,505 --> 00:34:15,765
Speaker 5:  and then Apple Intelligence will help you like write better shortcuts, which

613
00:34:15,765 --> 00:34:18,565
Speaker 5:  is super fascinating. Not 'cause I think it'll be any good.

614
00:34:18,695 --> 00:34:21,045
Speaker 7:  David, you actually, when you worked at the Wall Street Journal, did a column

615
00:34:21,105 --> 00:34:24,085
Speaker 7:  on shortcuts and I'm still go back to that column to try to figure out how

616
00:34:24,085 --> 00:34:27,085
Speaker 7:  the fuck to use shortcuts. Okay. So

617
00:34:27,105 --> 00:34:30,445
Speaker 6:  The thing I say on this podcast sometimes that I get emails about every single

618
00:34:30,445 --> 00:34:34,405
Speaker 6:  time is that shortcuts is a bad app and a failed experiment by Apple. And

619
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:38,405
Speaker 6:  everyone who made it should feel bad. And people get very upset with me about

620
00:34:38,405 --> 00:34:39,885
Speaker 6:  that. But also I am completely correct.

621
00:34:40,505 --> 00:34:44,365
Speaker 7:  Yes. Yeah. But like it, the potential of It is amazing. Yes. It's such a

622
00:34:44,365 --> 00:34:47,125
Speaker 7:  good idea. Back to home stuff. I know there's so many home things I can do

623
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:47,925
Speaker 7:  with shortcuts,

624
00:34:48,825 --> 00:34:52,245
Speaker 5:  But none of them work. 'cause they, the the phone forgets to run your shortcuts.

625
00:34:52,475 --> 00:34:56,085
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And David didn't write about it like six years ago. Yep. And I don't

626
00:34:56,085 --> 00:34:56,565
Speaker 7:  know how to do it.

627
00:34:56,715 --> 00:35:00,085
Speaker 6:  Yeah. You don't have a PhD in software engineering, so you can't possibly

628
00:35:00,085 --> 00:35:01,325
Speaker 6:  use the shortcuts app. So

629
00:35:01,325 --> 00:35:04,525
Speaker 5:  This is what AI should fix. Yes. Right. You have this automation engine inside

630
00:35:04,525 --> 00:35:08,485
Speaker 5:  the phone already and then you're like, robot do something.

631
00:35:08,485 --> 00:35:11,885
Speaker 5:  And it's like, I'm gonna use this automation engine. And so much

632
00:35:12,385 --> 00:35:16,365
Speaker 5:  of AI stuff right now is just basic automation

633
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:18,845
Speaker 5:  wrapped up in a natural language interface. Yeah.

634
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:19,365
Speaker 6:  Like

635
00:35:19,365 --> 00:35:22,725
Speaker 5:  It's, it's not as complicated as anybody is making some of this stuff. I

636
00:35:22,725 --> 00:35:22,925
Speaker 5:  will say

637
00:35:23,065 --> 00:35:26,485
Speaker 6:  You, you say that like it's, it's a small thing, but that's actually a huge

638
00:35:26,495 --> 00:35:30,245
Speaker 6:  thing. Yeah. Like automation, natural language automation,

639
00:35:30,425 --> 00:35:34,125
Speaker 6:  if that's the extent of what AI ever turns out to be, is still like an

640
00:35:34,325 --> 00:35:37,965
Speaker 6:  enormously huge deal in how we use computers. Which is the thing that drives

641
00:35:37,965 --> 00:35:40,845
Speaker 6:  me so crazy. It's like, it's just, it's sitting right there. It's also the

642
00:35:40,845 --> 00:35:44,645
Speaker 6:  easy part. Like yeah you all the developers have said, here are all the building

643
00:35:44,645 --> 00:35:48,165
Speaker 6:  blocks that I have and you have a thing that in theory is very good at assembling

644
00:35:48,165 --> 00:35:52,085
Speaker 6:  those building blocks all by itself. What are we doing here? You know what

645
00:35:52,085 --> 00:35:55,885
Speaker 7:  I'm sort of thinking, I know I'm cutting off your list. You, but

646
00:35:56,235 --> 00:35:57,045
Speaker 7:  like the rest

647
00:35:57,115 --> 00:35:58,485
Speaker 5:  List I would say is bad.

648
00:35:59,405 --> 00:35:59,805
Speaker 6:  I have one more.

649
00:35:59,915 --> 00:36:02,925
Speaker 7:  This conversation has like made me feel like maybe Apple really isn't gonna

650
00:36:02,925 --> 00:36:06,485
Speaker 7:  fail at AI in the same way. Like Apple failed at mobile me, but still pulled

651
00:36:06,485 --> 00:36:10,475
Speaker 7:  through on cloud. Like, let me go a little bit to explain that a

652
00:36:10,475 --> 00:36:14,315
Speaker 7:  little bit more. Like Apple intelligence as a term is a

653
00:36:14,315 --> 00:36:18,035
Speaker 7:  thing that is not good or associated with good

654
00:36:18,035 --> 00:36:21,835
Speaker 7:  things, with at least our community of people that work

655
00:36:22,175 --> 00:36:23,595
Speaker 7:  and think about tech a lot.

656
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:27,635
Speaker 6:  No. And everyone, okay. I don't know anyone in my life who has, who is like,

657
00:36:27,635 --> 00:36:29,195
Speaker 6:  you know, what's tight is Apple intelligence.

658
00:36:29,465 --> 00:36:32,955
Speaker 7:  Well I think actually those people in your life, like they didn't even know

659
00:36:32,955 --> 00:36:36,315
Speaker 7:  it was there. Right? True. And so like true, maybe this is Apple's like mobile

660
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:39,835
Speaker 7:  me moment in AI and now we're going to,

661
00:36:40,105 --> 00:36:43,995
Speaker 7:  they will unlock the things that where AI will actually play a,

662
00:36:44,075 --> 00:36:47,995
Speaker 7:  a big difference on the iPhone and this race towards making Siri. Like

663
00:36:47,995 --> 00:36:51,595
Speaker 7:  maybe we let them go for a little bit and go and hopefully fix that. It's

664
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:55,355
Speaker 7:  very important. Don't let me say like, it isn't important. It is absolutely

665
00:36:55,355 --> 00:36:58,755
Speaker 7:  important. If they do not get Siri right, they will lose to these other companies

666
00:36:58,755 --> 00:37:02,195
Speaker 7:  that are building great conversational ai. But

667
00:37:02,465 --> 00:37:04,795
Speaker 7:  like I have hope in the things we are talking about right now.

668
00:37:05,885 --> 00:37:09,445
Speaker 6:  I do too. And it's actually, it's the kind of thing Apple historically does

669
00:37:09,445 --> 00:37:13,405
Speaker 6:  really well, including with like machine learning and the neural engine

670
00:37:13,405 --> 00:37:17,325
Speaker 6:  stuff. Like so much of what everybody is now calling AI features, we

671
00:37:17,325 --> 00:37:20,445
Speaker 6:  used to just call like features. I

672
00:37:20,445 --> 00:37:20,925
Speaker 7:  Mean like Right.

673
00:37:21,035 --> 00:37:23,045
Speaker 6:  It's just software. So in so many ways

674
00:37:23,195 --> 00:37:24,045
Speaker 7:  It's like stuff you use.

675
00:37:24,315 --> 00:37:26,805
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And So I think there, there's a bunch of things, right? Like the idea

676
00:37:26,805 --> 00:37:30,645
Speaker 6:  that you can, you can essentially prompt your way through shortcuts is fundamentally

677
00:37:30,645 --> 00:37:33,565
Speaker 6:  just a, an AI feature, but it's, we don't think about it the same way. Right?

678
00:37:33,565 --> 00:37:37,205
Speaker 6:  And like one of the big things that has been rumored is AI

679
00:37:37,205 --> 00:37:40,165
Speaker 6:  powered battery management, which is also just called battery management.

680
00:37:40,365 --> 00:37:43,525
Speaker 6:  Like, it's just, it's, it's just software. But It is using went

681
00:37:43,525 --> 00:37:46,005
Speaker 7:  Through this with a cloud too. Like this is where I'm going with the mobile

682
00:37:46,105 --> 00:37:49,725
Speaker 7:  me iCloud situation. Right. Like mobile me was not

683
00:37:50,355 --> 00:37:50,645
Speaker 7:  good.

684
00:37:51,965 --> 00:37:55,175
Speaker 5:  Well we famously prompted a meeting where Steve Jobs said, while Mossberg

685
00:37:55,175 --> 00:37:58,815
Speaker 5:  said we were bad, whose fault is this? And got mad at everybody. Right?

686
00:37:59,275 --> 00:38:02,815
Speaker 5:  Not great. But when you say they, they came around, they like, they did iCloud

687
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:06,695
Speaker 5:  and then they iCloud big innovation. iCloud is not giving enough storage

688
00:38:06,755 --> 00:38:10,015
Speaker 5:  by default so that you have to pay them more money every month.

689
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:12,535
Speaker 7:  I don know photos iCloud works pretty great

690
00:38:12,755 --> 00:38:14,815
Speaker 5:  Except that it fills up your storage and you gotta pay them more money every,

691
00:38:14,885 --> 00:38:18,015
Speaker 5:  like that that's what they solved in the cloud, right. They backed everybody

692
00:38:18,015 --> 00:38:21,055
Speaker 5:  up and they, they made a business out of it by selling it's

693
00:38:21,055 --> 00:38:23,055
Speaker 7:  Capitalism. I don't know what to tell you, but it's

694
00:38:23,055 --> 00:38:26,695
Speaker 5:  True. It's not broken. The way that mobile me was the, the problem you have

695
00:38:26,695 --> 00:38:30,095
Speaker 5:  with shortcuts with a, you know, a prompt

696
00:38:30,415 --> 00:38:33,455
Speaker 5:  engineering interface is shortcuts doesn't work.

697
00:38:33,865 --> 00:38:34,215
Speaker 6:  Right.

698
00:38:35,035 --> 00:38:39,025
Speaker 5:  Right. So it, it would be really cool to be like, Hey, every single day

699
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:42,505
Speaker 5:  when I wake up I check these four apps. I need you to just go check 'em for

700
00:38:42,505 --> 00:38:45,945
Speaker 5:  me and tell me if anything good happened. Right. This is like a thing that

701
00:38:46,505 --> 00:38:50,295
Speaker 5:  a lot of people would love to automate and shortcuts

702
00:38:50,465 --> 00:38:53,895
Speaker 5:  today will be like, I am drunk and

703
00:38:54,495 --> 00:38:58,455
Speaker 5:  I didn't do it. Like, you're like, well you are a bad friend. Like

704
00:38:58,455 --> 00:39:01,415
Speaker 5:  you're just untrustworthy and I'm gonna check the apps on my own. And you

705
00:39:01,415 --> 00:39:05,215
Speaker 5:  can put a whole layer of AI on top of that. But the, the, the core engine

706
00:39:05,215 --> 00:39:08,365
Speaker 5:  of that product doesn't work. And like, I don't know if Apple can solve that.

707
00:39:08,665 --> 00:39:10,285
Speaker 7:  I'm even gonna see what my shortcuts are.

708
00:39:10,905 --> 00:39:12,205
Speaker 5:  You have shortcuts. I

709
00:39:12,205 --> 00:39:14,765
Speaker 7:  Have short because I've tried over the years like I have.

710
00:39:14,765 --> 00:39:17,325
Speaker 5:  You're the only shortcut I ever had that was any good. It was, it was, I

711
00:39:17,325 --> 00:39:20,605
Speaker 5:  would say Vergecast famous in like the mid

712
00:39:20,605 --> 00:39:24,365
Speaker 5:  2010s when Mike McCarthy was the coach of the Packers and would

713
00:39:24,365 --> 00:39:27,285
Speaker 5:  consistently lose in the playoffs. Sure. I had a shortcut on my home screen

714
00:39:27,435 --> 00:39:31,285
Speaker 5:  that just tweeted the words Fire Mark Mike McCarthy. And I pushed

715
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,245
Speaker 5:  it without fail every

716
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:33,365
Speaker 6:  Sunday. That's pretty good.

717
00:39:34,465 --> 00:39:38,125
Speaker 7:  All my, okay. This is amazing. This is very virtual. All my failed shortcuts

718
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:38,805
Speaker 7:  are for the garage.

719
00:39:41,415 --> 00:39:45,375
Speaker 7:  I tried so hard. I must have tried so hard. Siri, where my

720
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:46,695
Speaker 7:  keys, I, yeah, I've got some stuff.

721
00:39:47,105 --> 00:39:49,175
Speaker 5:  We're gonna fix you around his garage one of these days. No,

722
00:39:49,175 --> 00:39:52,775
Speaker 7:  We fixed it. My garage is great. I didn't want, like I I'm killing it. My

723
00:39:52,775 --> 00:39:55,935
Speaker 7:  garage is great. Neither you saw my garage. It's great. Every time I say

724
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:56,095
Speaker 5:  I did,

725
00:39:56,095 --> 00:39:58,775
Speaker 7:  I was there. It worked. Hey Siri, I'm gonna say it on the PO so everyone's

726
00:39:58,775 --> 00:40:01,975
Speaker 7:  garages will open or like the two people that set up their garages. Every

727
00:40:01,975 --> 00:40:03,615
Speaker 7:  time I say, Hey Siri, open the garage. It works

728
00:40:04,195 --> 00:40:06,575
Speaker 5:  On the other one of those people in my garage is open opening the garage.

729
00:40:06,635 --> 00:40:07,375
Speaker 5:  Did it actually just do it?

730
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:12,095
Speaker 7:  Yes. And my wife is gonna text me and say there's

731
00:40:12,335 --> 00:40:15,775
Speaker 7:  somebody in the house who opened the garage. Yep. Just got an alert. All

732
00:40:15,775 --> 00:40:18,175
Speaker 7:  my devices just said smart garage door opener.

733
00:40:19,365 --> 00:40:20,255
Speaker 5:  This is great radio.

734
00:40:20,675 --> 00:40:22,635
Speaker 7:  Hey Siri, close the garage.

735
00:40:23,135 --> 00:40:24,035
Speaker 5:  Oh my gosh. Joanna

736
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:25,435
Speaker 7:  Closing the garage.

737
00:40:27,305 --> 00:40:29,955
Speaker 5:  Very good. Two things on the list are kind of the same thing. One on the

738
00:40:29,955 --> 00:40:33,075
Speaker 5:  iPhone and one on the iPad. And they're basically, it's every, every year

739
00:40:33,075 --> 00:40:36,795
Speaker 5:  it's rumored that they will fix the iPad in some way. Yep. And by fix I mean

740
00:40:36,795 --> 00:40:40,755
Speaker 5:  just make it a Mac or add better multitasking. So the the idea, they'll

741
00:40:40,755 --> 00:40:44,515
Speaker 5:  add a menu bar, they'll add freeform multitasking. And then on the

742
00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:48,475
Speaker 5:  iPhone there's the idea that they will add like stage manager

743
00:40:48,775 --> 00:40:52,555
Speaker 5:  or make it more like decks that lets it the iPhone itself connect to a monitor

744
00:40:52,555 --> 00:40:56,435
Speaker 5:  and be a computer. If they did no AI stuff and they

745
00:40:56,435 --> 00:41:00,155
Speaker 5:  were just like, you can plug your iPhone into a bigger monitor and use it

746
00:41:00,155 --> 00:41:02,555
Speaker 5:  like a computer. I think people would lose their minds.

747
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:06,115
Speaker 6:  I would, I would just die of happiness that day.

748
00:41:06,695 --> 00:41:10,035
Speaker 6:  It would be managed so badly. It would be such an

749
00:41:10,355 --> 00:41:13,835
Speaker 6:  unusably chaotic feature. And I would love it to absolute pieces and use

750
00:41:13,835 --> 00:41:14,475
Speaker 6:  it every single day.

751
00:41:14,735 --> 00:41:16,235
Speaker 7:  But isn't that what they did last year?

752
00:41:16,535 --> 00:41:20,475
Speaker 6:  No. So now you can have it so that you have a separate monitor when it's

753
00:41:20,475 --> 00:41:24,235
Speaker 6:  plugged in, but it's, you're, you're essentially just moving an app

754
00:41:25,495 --> 00:41:28,875
Speaker 6:  and, and that's only on the, that's like the, the iPad is like slightly better

755
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:32,355
Speaker 6:  at this. You can do stage manager on an external display. Like it's all well

756
00:41:32,355 --> 00:41:32,555
Speaker 6:  and good.

757
00:41:32,605 --> 00:41:34,765
Speaker 7:  Sorry. I mean, I guess I mean iPhone mirroring

758
00:41:35,745 --> 00:41:38,485
Speaker 5:  To your, that's you can like plug a mouse in your iPhone and, and look at

759
00:41:38,485 --> 00:41:42,045
Speaker 5:  it on a monitor. This is, you have multiple monitors on iPhone and then ideally

760
00:41:42,195 --> 00:41:45,805
Speaker 5:  what you have, Google basically announced a riff on this. Like Samsung's

761
00:41:45,805 --> 00:41:49,565
Speaker 5:  had decks for a while where you like plug your Samsung phone into a monitor

762
00:41:49,565 --> 00:41:52,965
Speaker 5:  and a keyboard and you get like a Linux desktop with a weird Samsung browser.

763
00:41:52,965 --> 00:41:53,285
Speaker 5:  Right.

764
00:41:53,395 --> 00:41:55,645
Speaker 6:  Neil, I valiantly tried to do it. This

765
00:41:55,645 --> 00:41:59,045
Speaker 5:  Is my dream. I tried to use this for a while. It was not good.

766
00:42:00,105 --> 00:42:02,765
Speaker 5:  But Google's gonna do it and I think that might be really interesting. If

767
00:42:02,765 --> 00:42:06,405
Speaker 5:  that's part of Android, we actually get proper Chrome instead of weird Samsung

768
00:42:06,415 --> 00:42:07,085
Speaker 5:  stuff. I

769
00:42:07,085 --> 00:42:10,645
Speaker 6:  Mean plug your phone in and it becomes a Chromebook is like the dream. Yeah.

770
00:42:10,645 --> 00:42:12,845
Speaker 6:  Like it, it would work. It's just sitting there. Just

771
00:42:12,845 --> 00:42:15,805
Speaker 7:  Like this doesn't make any sense for Apple. They want you to buy a Mac, they

772
00:42:15,805 --> 00:42:19,085
Speaker 7:  want you to buy the iPad. So why would they want you to plug your iPhone

773
00:42:19,085 --> 00:42:19,645
Speaker 7:  into a monitor?

774
00:42:20,165 --> 00:42:21,805
Speaker 5:  'cause they gotta compete. They gotta do stuff.

775
00:42:22,085 --> 00:42:23,045
Speaker 7:  I don't think so. They're

776
00:42:23,045 --> 00:42:25,725
Speaker 5:  Behind over here. What now? Your phone's a banana. Like they gotta come up

777
00:42:25,725 --> 00:42:27,805
Speaker 5:  with ideas like let's do it.

778
00:42:28,165 --> 00:42:31,125
Speaker 7:  I just think there's like no, there's no upside for them here on this.

779
00:42:31,395 --> 00:42:35,045
Speaker 6:  This rumor is pretty thin. Yeah, I don't believe it. And I would bet against

780
00:42:35,045 --> 00:42:38,085
Speaker 6:  it coming true. But it also like Neli, I just think about something like

781
00:42:38,185 --> 00:42:40,885
Speaker 6:  you and I every year sit in meetings with Apple executives and every year

782
00:42:40,885 --> 00:42:43,405
Speaker 6:  the Apple executives tell us the story about how the devices are different

783
00:42:43,405 --> 00:42:47,285
Speaker 6:  and they're for different purposes. And It is like, It is reached a point

784
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:51,525
Speaker 6:  now where a, I believe Apple when it says these

785
00:42:51,525 --> 00:42:55,125
Speaker 6:  things that, that it perceives the devices to be differently. But I also

786
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:58,965
Speaker 6:  think It is so obstinately clinging to that idea that these devices

787
00:42:59,105 --> 00:43:02,605
Speaker 6:  cannot run into each other. That they're leaving. Like

788
00:43:02,605 --> 00:43:04,645
Speaker 6:  obviously good ideas on the table. I think

789
00:43:04,645 --> 00:43:08,165
Speaker 5:  The iPad is fully in a, the where are you gonna go Zone.

790
00:43:08,435 --> 00:43:12,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like they don't need to have more iPad ideas 'cause like someone's

791
00:43:12,325 --> 00:43:16,245
Speaker 5:  gotta watch Disney plus, like where are you gonna go? And like, so

792
00:43:16,245 --> 00:43:20,045
Speaker 5:  it goes and eventually I think it will just ease its way

793
00:43:20,045 --> 00:43:23,365
Speaker 5:  into being more Mac like that's just happening every year. But the idea that

794
00:43:23,385 --> 00:43:27,085
Speaker 5:  the phone itself would get this deck stuff kind of interesting.

795
00:43:27,265 --> 00:43:27,885
Speaker 6:  It would be super

796
00:43:28,085 --> 00:43:30,965
Speaker 5:  Interesting. There's other stuff we, we can just go through 'em. You're gonna

797
00:43:30,965 --> 00:43:34,605
Speaker 5:  get ChatGPT access on watchOS maybe. We'll see. There's

798
00:43:34,605 --> 00:43:38,045
Speaker 5:  literally no rumors about Macs except they're gonna name it Tahoe. Which

799
00:43:39,115 --> 00:43:42,285
Speaker 5:  Mark Berman reported like it was a big deal. He's like, they've been waiting

800
00:43:42,305 --> 00:43:45,005
Speaker 5:  for this one for, to use the name like Tahoe. 'cause they all have houses

801
00:43:45,025 --> 00:43:45,765
Speaker 5:  in Lake Tahoe. They

802
00:43:45,765 --> 00:43:48,565
Speaker 7:  All have houses there. Yes. They always are on vacation there.

803
00:43:49,245 --> 00:43:52,005
Speaker 5:  I think they should start naming them after small Midwestern towns. Mac s

804
00:43:52,005 --> 00:43:55,685
Speaker 5:  Wisconsin is available. Craig, there's much that AirPod

805
00:43:55,685 --> 00:43:57,845
Speaker 5:  rumors, sleep detection, camera control.

806
00:43:59,975 --> 00:44:03,945
Speaker 5:  Sure. I mean what they, the AirPod update everyone wants is you can just

807
00:44:03,945 --> 00:44:06,985
Speaker 5:  talk to a voice assistant. Yeah. Still waiting on that.

808
00:44:07,165 --> 00:44:10,745
Speaker 6:  The camera control thing is neat. I will say I think I, I'm, that would be

809
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:14,985
Speaker 6:  just from like a pure UI perspective. I'm fascinated to see that one.

810
00:44:15,105 --> 00:44:18,545
Speaker 6:  'cause it's like, are we gonna get to a point where half of everybody's photos

811
00:44:18,645 --> 00:44:21,945
Speaker 6:  now just have them with like two fingers on one of their ears? Or is there

812
00:44:21,945 --> 00:44:25,465
Speaker 6:  gonna be like, we're gonna get the new like millennial pause while everybody

813
00:44:25,465 --> 00:44:27,785
Speaker 6:  clicks the thing and then waits for it to start the video? Like, I don't

814
00:44:27,785 --> 00:44:30,985
Speaker 6:  know. I have so many questions, but it's, it's like, it's a smart idea to

815
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:32,725
Speaker 6:  let you have a remote on your AirPods.

816
00:44:33,165 --> 00:44:36,885
Speaker 7:  I would use this feature once a year at like our family.

817
00:44:37,065 --> 00:44:40,125
Speaker 7:  You like you do the big family picture and you set your, like right behind

818
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:43,925
Speaker 7:  you, David, you set your like camera up on the exactly like above the fireplace

819
00:44:43,985 --> 00:44:47,525
Speaker 7:  on that little mantle. And then you have to like, like struggle with your

820
00:44:47,535 --> 00:44:51,445
Speaker 7:  watch to figure out how to take the photo. I don't know why I would have

821
00:44:51,445 --> 00:44:52,725
Speaker 7:  my AirPods on in that show.

822
00:44:53,915 --> 00:44:56,965
Speaker 6:  It's because you're not a cool zoomer who just wears AirPods all the time.

823
00:44:57,195 --> 00:45:00,605
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I guess like, but when am I ever gonna wanna take a pho? Like, I guess

824
00:45:00,605 --> 00:45:01,885
Speaker 7:  like you wanna take a selfie

825
00:45:03,795 --> 00:45:06,855
Speaker 7:  but you have your arm out. I don't know. It's, it's, this is what I, I'm

826
00:45:06,855 --> 00:45:10,255
Speaker 7:  really interested to see the video let they like show this feature in or

827
00:45:10,255 --> 00:45:13,655
Speaker 7:  like me the still shot. Like what is the real life scenario when you wanna

828
00:45:13,655 --> 00:45:15,615
Speaker 7:  touch your iPad, your AirPod to take a photo.

829
00:45:15,815 --> 00:45:18,895
Speaker 6:  A bunch of people in our Slack were suggesting that Apple should let you

830
00:45:18,895 --> 00:45:21,975
Speaker 6:  just hold it in your hand and do it and just have it as like a little discre

831
00:45:21,975 --> 00:45:23,655
Speaker 6:  clicker. Oh, that would be very cool. Oh,

832
00:45:23,655 --> 00:45:26,695
Speaker 7:  Like the selfie clickers that they like sell the little like cheap China

833
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:30,615
Speaker 7:  Exactly button with the little camera button. All right, fine. I'm sold

834
00:45:30,615 --> 00:45:30,815
Speaker 7:  on

835
00:45:30,815 --> 00:45:33,335
Speaker 5:  That. There's, I can't think of a more dad situation than me being like,

836
00:45:33,335 --> 00:45:36,135
Speaker 5:  oh yeah, get this out. I'm gonna get my AirPod out of its case. Hold it upside

837
00:45:36,135 --> 00:45:39,575
Speaker 5:  down. As opposed to just being like, someone else will take this photo.

838
00:45:40,335 --> 00:45:40,735
Speaker 5:  We'll see,

839
00:45:40,815 --> 00:45:43,935
Speaker 6:  I don't know. Joanna's out here going everywhere and met us Smart glasses

840
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:46,655
Speaker 6:  so she can take pictures of her kids. I don't know their AirPods.

841
00:45:47,635 --> 00:45:49,135
Speaker 7:  Oh, I love my metas smartt glasses.

842
00:45:50,765 --> 00:45:51,885
Speaker 7:  I don't think we're talking about that here.

843
00:45:52,505 --> 00:45:55,845
Speaker 5:  All right, last one. There's like half a rumor. I just wanna

844
00:45:56,305 --> 00:46:00,235
Speaker 5:  do a time check on it. People think we might see Apple Smart

845
00:46:00,235 --> 00:46:03,955
Speaker 5:  Home device. I I think this is 0%

846
00:46:03,955 --> 00:46:05,035
Speaker 5:  happening. What do you guys think?

847
00:46:05,425 --> 00:46:05,715
Speaker 7:  Same.

848
00:46:06,135 --> 00:46:10,035
Speaker 6:  I'm pretty close to zero. I think the, the only thing I can think of

849
00:46:10,535 --> 00:46:14,515
Speaker 6:  is if you're Tim Cook right now and you've gone through all

850
00:46:14,515 --> 00:46:18,485
Speaker 6:  this stuff and you've said, we need, we need, we

851
00:46:18,485 --> 00:46:22,125
Speaker 6:  need a thing there. 'cause there isn't, there isn't a thing in here unless

852
00:46:22,145 --> 00:46:23,285
Speaker 6:  the redesign, I

853
00:46:23,285 --> 00:46:24,405
Speaker 5:  Think the redesign is the thing.

854
00:46:24,825 --> 00:46:25,525
Speaker 7:  It is the thing.

855
00:46:25,845 --> 00:46:28,485
Speaker 6:  I assume it'll be the thing that they mostly talk about and it, it probably,

856
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:31,285
Speaker 6:  but like, I don't know, maybe my hopes should be higher. My hopes are not

857
00:46:31,285 --> 00:46:34,645
Speaker 6:  super high for what that's gonna turn out to be. But like

858
00:46:35,335 --> 00:46:37,965
Speaker 6:  maybe you're Tim Cook and you look at this and you're like, we need a one

859
00:46:37,965 --> 00:46:41,755
Speaker 6:  more thing to just like get everybody's minds going

860
00:46:41,775 --> 00:46:45,515
Speaker 6:  and they just preview it in some way and they're like, apple

861
00:46:45,575 --> 00:46:48,115
Speaker 6:  has gotten increasingly comfortable being like, here is the thing that's

862
00:46:48,115 --> 00:46:51,875
Speaker 6:  coming later. And I, I could see it, I

863
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:55,315
Speaker 6:  wouldn't bet on it, but I also like, I could see the logic for like

864
00:46:55,465 --> 00:46:57,915
Speaker 6:  running the video at the end of the keynote. I could

865
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:01,595
Speaker 5:  See it. Yeah. I just think they got really burned with Apple Intelligence

866
00:47:01,595 --> 00:47:05,515
Speaker 5:  last year and they can't do that again. Yeah. I also think the point of

867
00:47:05,515 --> 00:47:06,835
Speaker 5:  the smart home device is

868
00:47:07,465 --> 00:47:07,755
Speaker 7:  Siri

869
00:47:07,895 --> 00:47:10,955
Speaker 5:  To, is Siri is to say like, you can just talk to this thing and I'll talk

870
00:47:10,955 --> 00:47:14,795
Speaker 5:  back to you and you can do automations by just saying out loud. Like,

871
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:18,355
Speaker 5:  when Joanna gets home, just open and close the garage door 50 times in a

872
00:47:18,355 --> 00:47:18,475
Speaker 5:  row

873
00:47:19,025 --> 00:47:22,395
Speaker 7:  Just to like, and celebrate that it doesn't do a dance.

874
00:47:24,525 --> 00:47:27,355
Speaker 5:  We'll see, I mean it would be exciting. Jan, are you gonna be there? You

875
00:47:27,355 --> 00:47:27,875
Speaker 5:  gonna be there? We're gonna,

876
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:31,375
Speaker 7:  There gonna have be there. I have made a list of three things I would like

877
00:47:31,375 --> 00:47:34,635
Speaker 7:  to see. Yeah. Would you guys like to hear that? Yes. Yeah. Maybe you guys

878
00:47:34,635 --> 00:47:38,275
Speaker 7:  can share your list. We should have prepared this, but my number

879
00:47:38,415 --> 00:47:42,155
Speaker 7:  one want is an iMessage in group

880
00:47:42,155 --> 00:47:44,035
Speaker 7:  messages, typing indicators for everybody.

881
00:47:44,735 --> 00:47:45,475
Speaker 5:  Oh, that'd be good.

882
00:47:45,625 --> 00:47:48,915
Speaker 6:  Like multiples. Each person gets a typing indicator. Yes. Just like

883
00:47:49,115 --> 00:47:52,875
Speaker 7:  I like that. Every other chat app has basically, I would love them

884
00:47:53,215 --> 00:47:56,435
Speaker 7:  to fix this reactions problem on the Mac.

885
00:47:57,275 --> 00:48:01,145
Speaker 7:  It's happening to me right now. Why does this popup come up

886
00:48:01,165 --> 00:48:01,665
Speaker 7:  all the time?

887
00:48:02,025 --> 00:48:03,545
Speaker 5:  I don't know. What's popup, what are you talking about? The one where

888
00:48:03,545 --> 00:48:06,025
Speaker 6:  You do a thumbs up and it does the, it does the wild thumbs up emoji

889
00:48:06,165 --> 00:48:09,905
Speaker 7:  Or just like has an like an alert here that says like, your reactions are

890
00:48:09,905 --> 00:48:10,265
Speaker 7:  enabled.

891
00:48:10,655 --> 00:48:13,945
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it sucks. It's terrible. Just turn it off. It's terrible. No one wants

892
00:48:13,945 --> 00:48:16,985
Speaker 6:  this. This has a 0% approval rate. This feature, turn

893
00:48:16,985 --> 00:48:20,905
Speaker 5:  It off. This is a real like COVID idea that just needs to go away. I I

894
00:48:20,905 --> 00:48:21,705
Speaker 5:  know what you're saying. Yeah, a

895
00:48:21,705 --> 00:48:22,585
Speaker 6:  Hundred percent. My

896
00:48:22,585 --> 00:48:25,545
Speaker 7:  Last thing is a Siri thing because this happens to me every morning when

897
00:48:25,545 --> 00:48:29,025
Speaker 7:  I want to ask the home pod to do something,

898
00:48:29,525 --> 00:48:33,505
Speaker 7:  but all the other Siri devices are doing them like my iPhone or my

899
00:48:33,505 --> 00:48:36,585
Speaker 7:  watch. And I just think like some improvement. And I actually think that's

900
00:48:36,585 --> 00:48:39,105
Speaker 7:  one of the main reasons not, there's a lot of reasons people hate Siri, but

901
00:48:39,105 --> 00:48:42,785
Speaker 7:  I think that's one of the most frustrating, real like

902
00:48:43,065 --> 00:48:46,905
Speaker 7:  consumer pain points of Siri, which is like, you want your Siri here to

903
00:48:46,905 --> 00:48:50,065
Speaker 7:  do a thing, but the Siri in the next room is doing it or your

904
00:48:50,585 --> 00:48:53,305
Speaker 7:  spouse's Siri or whatever is doing it. You

905
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:56,865
Speaker 5:  Like a Siri power user? Yeah. I mean I have that problem with Google Assistant,

906
00:48:56,865 --> 00:48:58,105
Speaker 5:  but I don't have a problem with Siri. I'm

907
00:48:58,105 --> 00:49:00,905
Speaker 6:  So sorry to everybody whose devices just went off 25 times. Yeah,

908
00:49:00,905 --> 00:49:01,185
Speaker 7:  I'm sorry.

909
00:49:02,085 --> 00:49:02,865
Speaker 5:  In the garage door.

910
00:49:03,765 --> 00:49:07,105
Speaker 7:  But I, yeah, like I have home pods, I've got iPhones, I've got watches,

911
00:49:07,535 --> 00:49:08,665
Speaker 7:  I've got iPads.

912
00:49:09,365 --> 00:49:13,345
Speaker 5:  Anyway, I I I have Siri Wakeboards disabled on all of those things. Yeah,

913
00:49:13,665 --> 00:49:16,345
Speaker 5:  I have a multiple device wishlist too, which is if they just spend an hour

914
00:49:16,345 --> 00:49:20,025
Speaker 5:  being like, we've made it so that the important notifications

915
00:49:20,095 --> 00:49:23,265
Speaker 5:  come to your actual phone instead of disappearing into the void on

916
00:49:24,025 --> 00:49:27,785
Speaker 5:  whatever other device we think is alive. Fair. Yeah. That would make me very

917
00:49:27,785 --> 00:49:27,985
Speaker 5:  happy.

918
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:31,385
Speaker 6:  Yeah. The this, it would be an interesting version of

919
00:49:32,015 --> 00:49:35,825
Speaker 6:  this year's WWDC if if instead of like announcing,

920
00:49:36,085 --> 00:49:39,745
Speaker 6:  you know, big giant sweeping changes to how everybody is going to do everything.

921
00:49:39,975 --> 00:49:42,545
Speaker 6:  They were just like, hi, we spent a year just fixing things.

922
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:43,745
Speaker 5:  Snow leopard baby.

923
00:49:44,095 --> 00:49:47,585
Speaker 6:  Yeah, this is Snow Leopard. We're just doing it again. And because there's

924
00:49:47,585 --> 00:49:51,465
Speaker 6:  so many little things, it's like, for me it's like fix headphone

925
00:49:51,465 --> 00:49:55,145
Speaker 6:  routing so that when someone calls me on my phone, it doesn't ring

926
00:49:55,155 --> 00:49:58,545
Speaker 6:  every device and decide to put my AirPods on my MacBook, which is closed

927
00:49:58,545 --> 00:50:01,945
Speaker 6:  in my backpack. Like, what if we did that? Wouldn't that be cool?

928
00:50:02,815 --> 00:50:05,625
Speaker 6:  There's just so many of those little things that it's like actually

929
00:50:06,725 --> 00:50:09,985
Speaker 6:  if put enough of those together and I think you might win a lot of people

930
00:50:09,985 --> 00:50:12,025
Speaker 6:  over in the course of like an hour of talking

931
00:50:12,035 --> 00:50:15,465
Speaker 5:  About Can I, can I just issue my wonkiest feature request related to headphone

932
00:50:15,465 --> 00:50:18,905
Speaker 5:  writing? Yes. You ready? So I've got, I I have a computer

933
00:50:19,325 --> 00:50:23,025
Speaker 5:  as many people know, I have a computer and my computer has multiple monitors

934
00:50:23,685 --> 00:50:27,025
Speaker 5:  and one of the monitors is like the video conferencing monitor and it's got

935
00:50:27,085 --> 00:50:30,815
Speaker 5:  like a little log tech speakerphone daily. And I

936
00:50:30,815 --> 00:50:33,815
Speaker 5:  can't be like the windows on this monitor. The audio needs to come outta

937
00:50:33,815 --> 00:50:37,615
Speaker 5:  that thing. And the windows on this monitor need to use these speakers. That's

938
00:50:37,615 --> 00:50:40,935
Speaker 5:  a good one. Yeah. And if I could just assign speakers to a display so that

939
00:50:40,945 --> 00:50:44,375
Speaker 5:  audio playing from a Chrome window on this computer on this screen

940
00:50:44,885 --> 00:50:48,575
Speaker 5:  came out of these speakers and audio playing on this screen came out of the

941
00:50:48,655 --> 00:50:51,935
Speaker 5:  I would just be, that's it. That's WC I'd be like, apple stock probably should

942
00:50:51,935 --> 00:50:55,895
Speaker 5:  go up 30 to 40% today. Like, don't worry about this AI

943
00:50:55,895 --> 00:50:59,595
Speaker 5:  stuff they fixed. I can assign speakers to displays and

944
00:51:00,475 --> 00:51:03,035
Speaker 5:  I think I might be the only person in America with this problem. So

945
00:51:03,135 --> 00:51:06,675
Speaker 7:  No, I have this problem not as like, I don't have as many monitors as you,

946
00:51:06,695 --> 00:51:07,915
Speaker 7:  but I I feel that problem.

947
00:51:10,135 --> 00:51:13,755
Speaker 7:  I this should, this should be the one more thing that Tim Cook announces.

948
00:51:14,305 --> 00:51:17,115
Speaker 7:  It's a, you know, they did all the stuff around the calculator last year

949
00:51:17,175 --> 00:51:19,955
Speaker 7:  was that last year? It's a tariff calculator.

950
00:51:20,965 --> 00:51:21,315
Speaker 5:  Rough.

951
00:51:22,135 --> 00:51:24,995
Speaker 6:  The numbers just magically change every five minutes for no reset.

952
00:51:24,995 --> 00:51:27,155
Speaker 7:  It's like you wanted to calculate it today. Here you go.

953
00:51:27,255 --> 00:51:30,515
Speaker 5:  That's what AI is good for is non-deterministic math

954
00:51:31,045 --> 00:51:32,635
Speaker 5:  where you're like, how much does this cost? It's

955
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:22,995
Speaker 5:  All right, we're back. Yeah, switch two. Launch week. We, we we, we started

956
00:55:22,995 --> 00:55:26,315
Speaker 5:  with Apple Rumors 'cause you know it's developer season and there's a lot

957
00:55:26,315 --> 00:55:29,955
Speaker 5:  going on over there and also the Switch two literally came out this morning.

958
00:55:30,675 --> 00:55:33,595
Speaker 5:  So there's not much to say except David has one

959
00:55:34,275 --> 00:55:34,475
Speaker 6:  I do.

960
00:55:34,825 --> 00:55:37,115
Speaker 5:  Lots of people on our staff have them actually. Yeah. What's it, what's it

961
00:55:37,115 --> 00:55:38,035
Speaker 5:  like? Are you happy? It's,

962
00:55:38,185 --> 00:55:42,075
Speaker 6:  Well I I really like it so far. So let me, let me, I had a really interesting

963
00:55:42,075 --> 00:55:45,675
Speaker 6:  experience trying to get it. So the, it launched at midnight

964
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:50,155
Speaker 6:  and we've been covering kind of the runup to it and there are like discords

965
00:55:50,155 --> 00:55:53,955
Speaker 6:  upon discords of people trying to figure out how to get one and gaming the

966
00:55:53,955 --> 00:55:57,875
Speaker 6:  system and keeping an eye on what's in stock and when, and there are, I

967
00:55:57,875 --> 00:56:01,355
Speaker 6:  live in a pretty sort of dense urban area, so there are lots of places around

968
00:56:01,355 --> 00:56:05,195
Speaker 6:  me that were open at midnight, but there are two, two doors apart from each

969
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,515
Speaker 6:  other. There's a Best Buy and a target and I was like, all right, one of

970
00:56:07,515 --> 00:56:11,235
Speaker 6:  them will have it for me. So I went over at like 10 30 last night

971
00:56:12,545 --> 00:56:16,515
Speaker 6:  just to see, I was like, if, if the line seems plausible, I'll

972
00:56:16,515 --> 00:56:20,355
Speaker 6:  sit in it and try and get one at midnight, like a hundred plus people in

973
00:56:20,355 --> 00:56:24,245
Speaker 6:  line, super nuts. So I just turned around and bailed, came home

974
00:56:24,245 --> 00:56:26,765
Speaker 6:  and I was like, well I guess I'm not getting a switch. I won't have one to

975
00:56:26,765 --> 00:56:30,485
Speaker 6:  talk about on the podcast today. And then this morning I'm

976
00:56:30,555 --> 00:56:34,005
Speaker 6:  sitting around looking at my phone ignoring my child as I am want to do from

977
00:56:34,005 --> 00:56:37,725
Speaker 6:  time to time and I just like went to target.com and was like, I wonder if

978
00:56:37,725 --> 00:56:41,485
Speaker 6:  they, and it just said like, oh, in stock at the Target right next to the

979
00:56:41,485 --> 00:56:45,405
Speaker 6:  Best Buy. So I literally just drove to Target and bought

980
00:56:45,445 --> 00:56:49,325
Speaker 6:  a switch to, it was like, it was the most mundane launch

981
00:56:49,385 --> 00:56:53,365
Speaker 6:  day experience you could possibly imagine. And I got there and there

982
00:56:53,365 --> 00:56:57,045
Speaker 6:  was a steady sort of rush of people, like as I was walking into people walked

983
00:56:57,045 --> 00:57:00,845
Speaker 6:  out with switches, both of whom were like clearly pumped that they had scored

984
00:57:00,845 --> 00:57:04,285
Speaker 6:  a switch. But then I went over and there was a case full of them. There were

985
00:57:04,445 --> 00:57:07,965
Speaker 6:  probably 15 of them just sitting in this case. They had three bundles left.

986
00:57:08,305 --> 00:57:12,085
Speaker 6:  The woman in front of me bought one for her 13-year-old son for his birthday

987
00:57:12,105 --> 00:57:16,045
Speaker 6:  and was like the relief on her face that she had managed to get

988
00:57:16,075 --> 00:57:19,885
Speaker 6:  like, I cannot describe to you how happy this woman was. And then I got one

989
00:57:19,885 --> 00:57:23,845
Speaker 6:  and then the person behind me got the last bundle and nobody wanted anything

990
00:57:23,845 --> 00:57:27,105
Speaker 6:  other than the bundle that comes with Mario Kart World. And so there's just

991
00:57:27,105 --> 00:57:30,945
Speaker 6:  a bunch of them lying around. And So I just like shot just sort of

992
00:57:30,945 --> 00:57:33,825
Speaker 6:  without even meaning to just like came home with a switch to

993
00:57:35,045 --> 00:57:38,955
Speaker 6:  set the thing up, giant pain in the ass and then

994
00:57:39,225 --> 00:57:41,515
Speaker 6:  like posted something and being like, I can't believe how easy this was.

995
00:57:41,575 --> 00:57:45,355
Speaker 6:  And I have heard from so many other people who were like, yeah, Nintendo

996
00:57:45,355 --> 00:57:49,275
Speaker 6:  put us through this weird rigamarole for months trying to, you had to

997
00:57:49,275 --> 00:57:52,995
Speaker 6:  get an invitation from Nintendo for a specific time to

998
00:57:53,185 --> 00:57:56,515
Speaker 6:  like insanity and then you could just wake up and go to Target and get one

999
00:57:56,705 --> 00:57:59,755
Speaker 6:  like truly bizarre launch day experience. Should

1000
00:57:59,755 --> 00:58:00,235
Speaker 7:  I get one?

1001
00:58:00,495 --> 00:58:01,475
Speaker 6:  You should definitely get one.

1002
00:58:01,585 --> 00:58:03,355
Speaker 7:  What accessories does the bundle come with?

1003
00:58:03,615 --> 00:58:05,915
Speaker 6:  The bundle comes with, it comes with the dock,

1004
00:58:08,045 --> 00:58:10,225
Speaker 6:  it comes with the weird

1005
00:58:11,765 --> 00:58:14,115
Speaker 6:  controller thing that I can't find. It

1006
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:15,315
Speaker 7:  Comes with that pillow. Amazing.

1007
00:58:15,495 --> 00:58:19,315
Speaker 6:  It comes with a pillow. I also bought the the camera. You

1008
00:58:19,315 --> 00:58:21,795
Speaker 7:  Bought the camera. I was gonna ask, so you have to buy the camera separately,

1009
00:58:21,795 --> 00:58:21,995
Speaker 7:  right?

1010
00:58:22,155 --> 00:58:26,035
Speaker 6:  I have not set this up yet. There's the, this was the switch to camera I

1011
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:29,995
Speaker 6:  think was like $55, which is absurd for like a little camera on

1012
00:58:29,995 --> 00:58:33,315
Speaker 6:  a stick. And then there's the pro controller, which everybody on our team

1013
00:58:33,315 --> 00:58:37,275
Speaker 6:  tells me I need to buy, which is $85. So I'm like, I, I'm

1014
00:58:37,275 --> 00:58:41,075
Speaker 6:  like 650 bucks deep on this thing by the time I actually get it

1015
00:58:41,125 --> 00:58:45,035
Speaker 6:  fully like up and running. But I will say I played it a bunch this morning

1016
00:58:45,035 --> 00:58:48,835
Speaker 6:  because it was, it was journalism, it's for work and my,

1017
00:58:48,905 --> 00:58:52,475
Speaker 6:  like the first game I played was, was fifa, which secondly called

1018
00:58:52,635 --> 00:58:55,915
Speaker 6:  EAFC 25. And I get emails every time. I don't say that I'm aware of the name

1019
00:58:55,915 --> 00:58:59,595
Speaker 6:  of the game. It's still called FIFA unbelievably faster, like night and day

1020
00:58:59,815 --> 00:59:03,155
Speaker 6:  Faster from the switch that I was using. And that was the main thing I was

1021
00:59:03,155 --> 00:59:07,035
Speaker 6:  wondering about. There's lots of new games. Mario Kart World is, is

1022
00:59:07,215 --> 00:59:09,035
Speaker 6:  big and very fun and I've played a little bit of it,

1023
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:14,915
Speaker 6:  but just the, the like raw speed upgrade of the old games that I had

1024
00:59:14,915 --> 00:59:18,835
Speaker 6:  been annoyed by on an 8-year-old console. Like it, like

1025
00:59:18,895 --> 00:59:20,155
Speaker 6:  new games, which was

1026
00:59:20,185 --> 00:59:22,845
Speaker 7:  Very exciting. Now I'm tempted to go buy one. I don't wanna buy one, but

1027
00:59:23,025 --> 00:59:25,965
Speaker 7:  my 7-year-old is like, he doesn't actually know that there's a new switch

1028
00:59:25,965 --> 00:59:29,645
Speaker 7:  out, I don't think. But I, Ima like It is a maddening

1029
00:59:29,645 --> 00:59:33,285
Speaker 7:  experience. Experience downloading games on his switch.

1030
00:59:33,545 --> 00:59:37,125
Speaker 7:  Oh yeah, like the slowness, the everything is just like the parent, the parental

1031
00:59:37,125 --> 00:59:40,765
Speaker 7:  control. I mean, talk about software that needs a refresh. Like, I don't

1032
00:59:40,765 --> 00:59:44,205
Speaker 7:  know if that's been done. Is that done on the, on the two? Is there like

1033
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:44,445
Speaker 7:  it's

1034
00:59:44,445 --> 00:59:48,365
Speaker 6:  It's sort of stylistically similar, but it's it's clearly not the same software,

1035
00:59:48,365 --> 00:59:51,365
Speaker 6:  if that makes sense. Yeah. Like they didn't blow up the model, but It is,

1036
00:59:51,365 --> 00:59:54,525
Speaker 6:  It is noticeably better and faster in basically every interaction

1037
00:59:54,595 --> 00:59:56,765
Speaker 7:  That might be worth it. There's so is one

1038
00:59:56,765 --> 01:00:00,125
Speaker 6:  I've been, I've been very impressed so far, but what's been really interesting

1039
01:00:00,145 --> 01:00:04,125
Speaker 6:  is like the, the vibes around this launch are not that good, I don't

1040
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:07,965
Speaker 6:  think we've been talking a lot about this internally, but also like

1041
01:00:08,695 --> 01:00:12,365
Speaker 6:  there were, there were these big lines, but also Nintendo

1042
01:00:12,365 --> 01:00:15,565
Speaker 6:  didn't do reviews ahead of time for a couple of different reasons, which

1043
01:00:15,565 --> 01:00:19,285
Speaker 6:  is like fine. But I think also there is something to the like

1044
01:00:20,045 --> 01:00:22,925
Speaker 6:  coverage in the lead up to this thing that would've been exciting for people.

1045
01:00:23,545 --> 01:00:26,365
Speaker 6:  But then also everybody I talk to is like, eh, I'll buy it when there's better

1046
01:00:26,365 --> 01:00:26,605
Speaker 6:  games.

1047
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:30,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That's kinda how I feel. You're six 50 deep into Mario Kart World and

1048
01:00:30,285 --> 01:00:30,965
Speaker 5:  like, eh, I can wait.

1049
01:00:31,065 --> 01:00:34,405
Speaker 6:  So that's where a surprising number of people seem to have landed. And I

1050
01:00:34,405 --> 01:00:38,125
Speaker 6:  think there's, there's the Donkey Kong game coming. Like they had the, the

1051
01:00:38,365 --> 01:00:41,565
Speaker 6:  announcement that the Nintendo direct of all these games, what in April.

1052
01:00:42,625 --> 01:00:45,045
Speaker 6:  And people came away from that being like, great, there's an awesome slate

1053
01:00:45,045 --> 01:00:48,685
Speaker 6:  of games. Lots of stuff is coming, but on day one it really is a

1054
01:00:48,685 --> 01:00:51,445
Speaker 6:  $500 Mario Kart machine. Like in, in a really real way.

1055
01:00:52,025 --> 01:00:52,845
Speaker 7:  But the bigger screen

1056
01:00:53,395 --> 01:00:53,845
Speaker 6:  With the

1057
01:00:53,885 --> 01:00:56,365
Speaker 5:  Bigger screen, yeah, it, I mean that's a big boy. Hold it up again. Yeah,

1058
01:00:56,505 --> 01:00:59,805
Speaker 6:  It is big. So this is the switch too. Oh yeah.

1059
01:01:00,505 --> 01:01:02,125
Speaker 6:  And I'll, I'll just, just to compare,

1060
01:01:03,675 --> 01:01:06,325
Speaker 6:  this is the regular switch so It is like, oh

1061
01:01:06,325 --> 01:01:06,965
Speaker 7:  Yeah, look at that.

1062
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:10,335
Speaker 6:  A meaningfully bigger thing. Yeah. Yeah.

1063
01:01:10,575 --> 01:01:13,295
Speaker 5:  I mean the only game we play on the switch is UNT huddled Goose game. And

1064
01:01:13,535 --> 01:01:15,135
Speaker 5:  I think we can, we'll make it through,

1065
01:01:15,265 --> 01:01:16,695
Speaker 6:  Think about how fast the goose will be.

1066
01:01:17,235 --> 01:01:21,095
Speaker 7:  We play mar we tend play a ton of Mario Kart my son's obsessed with

1067
01:01:21,145 --> 01:01:21,655
Speaker 7:  among us.

1068
01:01:22,315 --> 01:01:23,775
Speaker 5:  Oh, I gotta start doing that with Max

1069
01:01:24,535 --> 01:01:28,215
Speaker 7:  Obsessed. So I mean like that like very simple 2D game I'm sure is not

1070
01:01:28,215 --> 01:01:31,935
Speaker 7:  necessarily any better on the switch too. So we're good. All

1071
01:01:32,095 --> 01:01:35,935
Speaker 5:  Right. We're gonna have lots of switch coverage coming 'cause like so much

1072
01:01:35,935 --> 01:01:39,925
Speaker 5:  of our staff has a switch to, they wanna talk about it a lot.

1073
01:01:40,045 --> 01:01:42,165
Speaker 5:  I suspect next week David, you're gonna have a whole switch to

1074
01:01:42,405 --> 01:01:45,205
Speaker 6:  Situation. So yeah, we, I can just tell people the schedule here. So Tuesday

1075
01:01:45,505 --> 01:01:49,485
Speaker 6:  is gonna be our big post WWDC episode and then I would say most of next

1076
01:01:49,485 --> 01:01:52,845
Speaker 6:  Friday and then all of the following Tuesday is all gonna be switched stuff

1077
01:01:53,365 --> 01:01:56,165
Speaker 6:  because that's when we'll have we, we will have reviewed the thing, we'll

1078
01:01:56,165 --> 01:01:58,805
Speaker 6:  have played all the games, we'll have tried all the accessories. Like we're,

1079
01:01:58,805 --> 01:02:02,165
Speaker 6:  we're sort of deliberately waiting a minute to like really do this thing

1080
01:02:02,165 --> 01:02:06,085
Speaker 6:  big. So we will, we have a lot more coming. And also call the hotline

1081
01:02:06,085 --> 01:02:09,405
Speaker 6:  and send us emails if you have questions because like two thirds of our staff

1082
01:02:09,425 --> 01:02:11,765
Speaker 6:  has one of these so we're, we're gonna get a lot of 'em on to talk about

1083
01:02:11,765 --> 01:02:12,645
Speaker 6:  it with us. Yeah.

1084
01:02:12,945 --> 01:02:16,325
Speaker 5:  All right Jen, I know you gotta, you gotta jump out here real quick before

1085
01:02:16,325 --> 01:02:20,085
Speaker 5:  we go. There is a bunch of new news but meta's like

1086
01:02:20,085 --> 01:02:23,965
Speaker 5:  experimental smart glasses, aria, you are like, you're, you know,

1087
01:02:23,965 --> 01:02:27,885
Speaker 5:  you're the Meta glasses Stan on the show. What are you, what you,

1088
01:02:28,905 --> 01:02:31,525
Speaker 5:  and then they're gonna start do wait, I mean you wear them and you take pictures.

1089
01:02:31,765 --> 01:02:32,645
Speaker 5:  I do. That's more than did

1090
01:02:32,645 --> 01:02:32,925
Speaker 7:  You wear them?

1091
01:02:33,365 --> 01:02:37,245
Speaker 5:  I bought the Clear Ray bands when they announce them and I was so

1092
01:02:37,325 --> 01:02:39,725
Speaker 5:  excited to get them and I bought them and I put them on my face and I was

1093
01:02:39,725 --> 01:02:42,205
Speaker 5:  like, no thank you. And I sent them back. You're

1094
01:02:42,265 --> 01:02:44,805
Speaker 6:  Mad that you have a big head. It's, it's fine.

1095
01:02:44,835 --> 01:02:46,565
Speaker 5:  They were not big enough for my head, like email a

1096
01:02:46,565 --> 01:02:50,365
Speaker 6:  Bed. I also have a big head like I get it, but it's not Meta's fault that

1097
01:02:50,365 --> 01:02:51,365
Speaker 6:  we have big heads. I

1098
01:02:51,365 --> 01:02:54,565
Speaker 5:  Was just like, I have good cameras that are fun to use and this is, I don't

1099
01:02:54,565 --> 01:02:58,205
Speaker 5:  know, what am I doing? And then they, there's some Quest stuff coming

1100
01:02:58,255 --> 01:03:01,685
Speaker 5:  along. Like there's a little bit of an arbitrage between Apple and Meta about

1101
01:03:01,685 --> 01:03:05,405
Speaker 5:  like exclusive VR content. I don't know, what do you think of the,

1102
01:03:05,405 --> 01:03:09,165
Speaker 5:  these new glasses? Because it seems like no one has solved the

1103
01:03:09,165 --> 01:03:12,485
Speaker 5:  display issue for augmented reality glasses, but we're adding more and more

1104
01:03:12,515 --> 01:03:14,485
Speaker 5:  sensors to the prototypes every single day.

1105
01:03:14,675 --> 01:03:18,285
Speaker 7:  Well I feel like this is what like a step towards, more towards the Orion

1106
01:03:18,435 --> 01:03:19,205
Speaker 7:  type of dream

1107
01:03:19,625 --> 01:03:23,605
Speaker 5:  And Orion were the augmented reality glasses that cost $10,000 a unit that

1108
01:03:23,605 --> 01:03:24,885
Speaker 5:  Meta could not manufacture at scale.

1109
01:03:25,675 --> 01:03:28,065
Speaker 7:  Right. And this is what a,

1110
01:03:29,075 --> 01:03:31,965
Speaker 7:  something that's supposed to come out later this year for researchers to

1111
01:03:31,965 --> 01:03:35,645
Speaker 7:  work with and developers to work with, I believe. So there's like some

1112
01:03:35,795 --> 01:03:39,725
Speaker 7:  real actual movement towards this, which

1113
01:03:39,845 --> 01:03:43,725
Speaker 7:  I think has like been what Meta does that I I think

1114
01:03:43,825 --> 01:03:46,605
Speaker 7:  and I think intentionally does that Apple doesn't, right? They're like building

1115
01:03:46,665 --> 01:03:49,365
Speaker 7:  out in front and there's just saying, hey, here's where we are having issues,

1116
01:03:49,385 --> 01:03:52,205
Speaker 7:  here's where we're trying to build. I think we're seeing Google try to do

1117
01:03:52,205 --> 01:03:55,885
Speaker 7:  that to a degree right now with, I get very confused, the

1118
01:03:56,145 --> 01:03:59,765
Speaker 7:  XR glasses, which are not the XR headset

1119
01:03:59,985 --> 01:04:02,565
Speaker 7:  that's supposed to come out this year, am I? Is that right? Right.

1120
01:04:02,915 --> 01:04:06,485
Speaker 6:  Yeah, there's there's the headset, which is Project Mohan, which I always

1121
01:04:06,725 --> 01:04:09,765
Speaker 6:  remember 'cause it's such stupid names. It's a very, and then there's

1122
01:04:09,825 --> 01:04:12,565
Speaker 5:  So SI Sundar referred to the headset as goggles. Right? Goggles. Which is

1123
01:04:12,565 --> 01:04:13,365
Speaker 5:  which an incredible term.

1124
01:04:13,585 --> 01:04:16,125
Speaker 7:  Oh, interesting. Well I loved that actually from him. He was like, we're

1125
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:17,365
Speaker 7:  gonna have goggles or we're gonna have glasses.

1126
01:04:18,225 --> 01:04:22,205
Speaker 6:  Do you think he knows that Google already made a thing called goggles a

1127
01:04:22,205 --> 01:04:23,125
Speaker 6:  long time ago. Course they did.

1128
01:04:23,705 --> 01:04:24,845
Speaker 5:  No, no. Mohan

1129
01:04:25,625 --> 01:04:29,245
Speaker 7:  But Mohan back to Mohan. Mohan is

1130
01:04:29,405 --> 01:04:33,205
Speaker 7:  also like considered under Android xr, is that right? Yes. Like

1131
01:04:33,205 --> 01:04:34,485
Speaker 7:  is that Yeah,

1132
01:04:34,955 --> 01:04:35,245
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

1133
01:04:35,595 --> 01:04:39,525
Speaker 7:  Very confusing. But what's happening, like, it's like everyone

1134
01:04:39,545 --> 01:04:43,485
Speaker 7:  has these two paths going, right? Google, Meta Apple, we think

1135
01:04:43,485 --> 01:04:46,805
Speaker 7:  Apple at least on the glasses, but for sure they do. There are some efforts

1136
01:04:46,805 --> 01:04:50,725
Speaker 7:  that are going towards the goggles as Sundar said, and some

1137
01:04:50,725 --> 01:04:53,405
Speaker 7:  efforts that are obviously going towards the glasses and hopefully eventually

1138
01:04:53,405 --> 01:04:55,965
Speaker 7:  they think these things will converge and they'll, they'll come together.

1139
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:59,925
Speaker 7:  But like the focus on the goggles right now is really interesting

1140
01:05:00,075 --> 01:05:02,725
Speaker 7:  that we had the, the journal had this story that Meta is trying to go after

1141
01:05:02,725 --> 01:05:06,605
Speaker 7:  Disney with exclusive content. It's like, is this

1142
01:05:06,685 --> 01:05:09,765
Speaker 7:  a world like we're gonna probably hear more about the Vision Pro last year.

1143
01:05:09,765 --> 01:05:13,365
Speaker 7:  Like where like you just feel like no one's really

1144
01:05:13,415 --> 01:05:17,325
Speaker 7:  using that type of device at scale. I mean mean not,

1145
01:05:17,385 --> 01:05:20,205
Speaker 7:  not we don't feel like It is. It's true. The numbers are there, right? Like

1146
01:05:20,205 --> 01:05:24,125
Speaker 7:  the number people aren't, but yet they still keep pushing into

1147
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:27,285
Speaker 7:  those directions. My guess though is like for the hope that eventually that

1148
01:05:27,285 --> 01:05:30,365
Speaker 7:  stuff comes when we're down the path that it comes to the glasses.

1149
01:05:30,955 --> 01:05:34,885
Speaker 5:  Well so you look at these new glasses and I mean it's just a

1150
01:05:35,045 --> 01:05:38,525
Speaker 5:  bunch of sensors really, right? They've added more spatial

1151
01:05:38,755 --> 01:05:42,365
Speaker 5:  mics, they've added ambient sensors, more track

1152
01:05:42,725 --> 01:05:46,365
Speaker 5:  movement trackers, more eye tracking cameras. Like no one has solved the

1153
01:05:46,365 --> 01:05:50,125
Speaker 5:  problem of the display, right? The or Meta is Orion

1154
01:05:50,125 --> 01:05:52,725
Speaker 5:  glasses were an attempt to solve the display problem, which is why they were

1155
01:05:52,725 --> 01:05:56,405
Speaker 5:  so expensive and un manufacturable at scale, right? So like we can put stuff

1156
01:05:56,405 --> 01:06:00,205
Speaker 5:  in front of your eyes. The Google glasses we just saw were like,

1157
01:06:00,205 --> 01:06:03,045
Speaker 5:  we're gonna put stuff in front of your eyes. But they were teeny tiny field

1158
01:06:03,045 --> 01:06:06,805
Speaker 5:  of view and it wasn't like mapped to reality in any way. It was just a,

1159
01:06:06,805 --> 01:06:10,525
Speaker 5:  it's basically a screen in front of your face. There's this big problem where

1160
01:06:10,545 --> 01:06:13,725
Speaker 5:  no one has solved the core component of augmented reality glasses,

1161
01:06:14,375 --> 01:06:18,245
Speaker 5:  which is putting stuff on a screen that is like mapped

1162
01:06:18,305 --> 01:06:22,105
Speaker 5:  to the world. And I think that's why everyone is doing these like ski

1163
01:06:22,105 --> 01:06:22,505
Speaker 5:  helmets

1164
01:06:22,535 --> 01:06:24,105
Speaker 7:  Because they can do it there. You

1165
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:27,385
Speaker 5:  Can do right camera pass through VR xr

1166
01:06:28,245 --> 01:06:31,425
Speaker 5:  and then it's like you built a simulator of the thing, but at least you're

1167
01:06:31,425 --> 01:06:35,145
Speaker 5:  working on it while you know, some mad scientist is solving your

1168
01:06:35,145 --> 01:06:38,625
Speaker 5:  display problem. But it's none of it's convincing. Well

1169
01:06:38,625 --> 01:06:41,185
Speaker 7:  That's how I know like how we all felt about the Vision Pro, but it's like

1170
01:06:41,185 --> 01:06:44,985
Speaker 7:  they still keep going at it. Which I guess if you're as the size of these

1171
01:06:45,185 --> 01:06:46,265
Speaker 7:  companies, you can, well

1172
01:06:46,265 --> 01:06:48,985
Speaker 5:  David, you were saying this, the sensor problem is so big that maybe they're

1173
01:06:48,985 --> 01:06:51,825
Speaker 5:  just focused on that while someone figures out the display problem. Yeah,

1174
01:06:51,865 --> 01:06:55,145
Speaker 6:  I mean I think the, the thing I keep hearing about smart glasses is that

1175
01:06:56,405 --> 01:07:00,265
Speaker 6:  the people who are making them are like everybody is wildly underestimating

1176
01:07:00,285 --> 01:07:03,825
Speaker 6:  how hard every single part of this problem is. Like I remember years ago,

1177
01:07:03,935 --> 01:07:07,825
Speaker 6:  some of the folks who were running this at Google were like, you don't understand

1178
01:07:07,885 --> 01:07:11,745
Speaker 6:  how different a thing It is that I have to make a product that

1179
01:07:11,745 --> 01:07:15,385
Speaker 6:  if it gets in your way at the wrong moment, once it has ruined

1180
01:07:15,845 --> 01:07:19,825
Speaker 6:  the success of that product. Like if, if I, if I push a notification while

1181
01:07:19,825 --> 01:07:23,305
Speaker 6:  you're asleep or like, I don't know, whatever having sex, like

1182
01:07:23,975 --> 01:07:27,745
Speaker 6:  once the whole thing falls apart and they were like, the bar for the user

1183
01:07:27,745 --> 01:07:31,545
Speaker 6:  interface is so high and what it means is I have to have perfect awareness

1184
01:07:31,845 --> 01:07:35,705
Speaker 6:  at all times of both you and the world and both

1185
01:07:35,705 --> 01:07:38,985
Speaker 6:  directions of that are incredibly hard. And So I think what's interesting

1186
01:07:38,985 --> 01:07:40,385
Speaker 6:  to me about this Meta thing is like

1187
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:45,625
Speaker 6:  the idea of how do we put all this stuff in these glasses that can just look

1188
01:07:45,625 --> 01:07:49,505
Speaker 6:  at your eyes all the time, right? It's like blink detection and and directional

1189
01:07:49,535 --> 01:07:53,425
Speaker 6:  like following your eyes where you go and looking at per eye detection, like

1190
01:07:53,575 --> 01:07:57,465
Speaker 6:  this stuff is so hard and it's such cutting edge science and It is just

1191
01:07:57,765 --> 01:07:59,665
Speaker 6:  one piece of the equation here.

1192
01:08:00,265 --> 01:08:02,665
Speaker 5:  I just have, sorry I just have this, you said this and now I have to think

1193
01:08:02,665 --> 01:08:05,505
Speaker 5:  about Micro Mark Zuckerberg is like, I need to know if you're banging,

1194
01:08:05,645 --> 01:08:09,105
Speaker 6:  We got a hotline question maybe 10 days ago that I will, we will answer on

1195
01:08:09,105 --> 01:08:12,385
Speaker 6:  the show from somebody who was like, I have smart glasses.

1196
01:08:12,885 --> 01:08:16,605
Speaker 6:  Do I need and they have my prescription, do I have to take them off before

1197
01:08:16,605 --> 01:08:19,285
Speaker 6:  I have sex? Otherwise there's cameras on my face while we're having sex.

1198
01:08:19,425 --> 01:08:21,885
Speaker 6:  And I have been not, I have not been able to stop thinking about it ever

1199
01:08:21,885 --> 01:08:22,485
Speaker 6:  since. Yeah,

1200
01:08:22,525 --> 01:08:24,645
Speaker 7:  I was wondering where that came from. David, get

1201
01:08:24,645 --> 01:08:26,005
Speaker 5:  Some other glasses bro.

1202
01:08:26,345 --> 01:08:28,325
Speaker 7:  It came from nowhere in your example.

1203
01:08:29,075 --> 01:08:32,685
Speaker 6:  That was the question, do I need dumb glasses for the bedroom and smart glasses

1204
01:08:32,685 --> 01:08:33,245
Speaker 6:  everywhere else?

1205
01:08:33,925 --> 01:08:37,885
Speaker 5:  Nowhere. It's like your Instagram followers have sent you three

1206
01:08:37,885 --> 01:08:39,485
Speaker 5:  messages and it's like no.

1207
01:08:40,695 --> 01:08:43,225
Speaker 6:  Yeah, pretty sure you're throwing those things in the trash the first time

1208
01:08:43,225 --> 01:08:43,585
Speaker 6:  that happens.

1209
01:08:43,945 --> 01:08:47,585
Speaker 5:  You know what I mean? Like a pure growth hacky Instagram notification would

1210
01:08:47,585 --> 01:08:48,225
Speaker 5:  be would be horrible

1211
01:08:48,725 --> 01:08:51,865
Speaker 6:  Vs. Song. Heard that hotline question and immediately demanded to talk about

1212
01:08:51,865 --> 01:08:55,625
Speaker 6:  it with me on the show as did my wife. So we will come back to that. But

1213
01:08:55,725 --> 01:08:59,625
Speaker 5:  The idea that like getting all the sensors, I mean we, we've gone

1214
01:08:59,625 --> 01:09:02,065
Speaker 5:  through this list so many times. Smart cloud, you need the display, the displays

1215
01:09:02,065 --> 01:09:05,545
Speaker 5:  are impossible but no one can literally, no one has built one. Yeah that

1216
01:09:05,545 --> 01:09:09,505
Speaker 5:  works at scale. That is manufacturable. You need to put compute in

1217
01:09:09,505 --> 01:09:13,425
Speaker 5:  there that you need a lot of it to detect the world and then

1218
01:09:13,425 --> 01:09:17,385
Speaker 5:  like immediately overlay graphics and then you need connectivity and

1219
01:09:17,385 --> 01:09:20,585
Speaker 5:  then you need a battery that can support all that compute and that connectivity

1220
01:09:20,685 --> 01:09:24,425
Speaker 5:  in real time that is running all the time. And then you need like a content

1221
01:09:24,425 --> 01:09:27,625
Speaker 5:  moderation system so that if you're looking at the United States capital

1222
01:09:27,805 --> 01:09:31,745
Speaker 5:  on January 6th, it doesn't tell you like this was the site

1223
01:09:31,745 --> 01:09:35,265
Speaker 5:  of Donald Trump's greatest triumph. Like you've got a million problems to

1224
01:09:35,265 --> 01:09:37,945
Speaker 5:  solve. Right. And bang detection apparently is very important to everyone.

1225
01:09:37,945 --> 01:09:38,225
Speaker 5:  It's

1226
01:09:38,225 --> 01:09:38,505
Speaker 6:  A big one.

1227
01:09:38,865 --> 01:09:39,155
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

1228
01:09:39,915 --> 01:09:42,675
Speaker 5:  I don't sex mode we're years away from this. I think this is why you get,

1229
01:09:43,195 --> 01:09:46,275
Speaker 5:  I think it would be better if the industry is like these mixed reality VR

1230
01:09:46,275 --> 01:09:49,995
Speaker 5:  headset. They are the simulators. Yeah. Like I think if

1231
01:09:50,195 --> 01:09:53,515
Speaker 5:  everyone was honest that these are not products meant to scale, but this

1232
01:09:53,515 --> 01:09:56,675
Speaker 5:  is how we're gonna work our way towards building the appropriate applications.

1233
01:09:57,255 --> 01:09:59,835
Speaker 5:  It might just like change how everyone perceives them.

1234
01:10:00,255 --> 01:10:02,835
Speaker 6:  But I think like also to your point Joanna, about the, the content thing,

1235
01:10:02,835 --> 01:10:06,715
Speaker 6:  I think one of the reasons everyone is chasing that idea so

1236
01:10:06,715 --> 01:10:10,515
Speaker 6:  hard is that it feels doable, right? If if

1237
01:10:10,515 --> 01:10:14,435
Speaker 6:  it's just we're gonna build all this wild stuff, but if the first thing we

1238
01:10:14,435 --> 01:10:18,275
Speaker 6:  can build is just like a sick personal television that you wear on your

1239
01:10:18,275 --> 01:10:21,435
Speaker 6:  face, maybe that'll work for people. And I'm, I'm suspicious of the idea

1240
01:10:21,435 --> 01:10:25,035
Speaker 6:  that that's a thing anybody wants, but I think It is, It is at least like

1241
01:10:25,695 --> 01:10:28,995
Speaker 6:  It is a version of this that feels achievable for these companies. And so

1242
01:10:28,995 --> 01:10:31,195
Speaker 6:  they are like pushing relentlessly after it.

1243
01:10:31,545 --> 01:10:35,355
Speaker 7:  Yeah and I mean obviously that's what Apple's been marketing

1244
01:10:35,365 --> 01:10:38,555
Speaker 7:  still with the Vision Pro, right? It is like your personal tv,

1245
01:10:38,705 --> 01:10:42,675
Speaker 5:  Have you seen an ounce of Vision Pro marketing in past five months? They

1246
01:10:42,675 --> 01:10:46,195
Speaker 6:  Just put out like a Bono video that no one watched

1247
01:10:46,655 --> 01:10:47,715
Speaker 5:  Bono's everywhere right now

1248
01:10:48,015 --> 01:10:51,875
Speaker 7:  Any of the pitches you get from pr, anything they post to the newsroom

1249
01:10:51,905 --> 01:10:55,715
Speaker 7:  like is all about the content. It's really not beyond that

1250
01:10:55,715 --> 01:10:58,875
Speaker 7:  at this point. Right. Watching sports, watching this, watching that. Like

1251
01:10:59,485 --> 01:11:03,435
Speaker 7:  maybe using your Mac right, they had the improvement or the Apple

1252
01:11:03,435 --> 01:11:05,515
Speaker 7:  intelligence came for that. I mean, yeah.

1253
01:11:05,815 --> 01:11:08,995
Speaker 5:  Did you see the price right clip where people try to guess the price to the

1254
01:11:08,995 --> 01:11:09,395
Speaker 5:  Vision Pro?

1255
01:11:09,615 --> 01:11:10,715
Speaker 7:  Yes. Amazing. It

1256
01:11:10,715 --> 01:11:11,475
Speaker 6:  Was very good.

1257
01:11:11,475 --> 01:11:12,835
Speaker 5:  People were like a hundred dollars.

1258
01:11:13,755 --> 01:11:16,645
Speaker 7:  It's funny as we have you guys, somebody I believe wrote about these there

1259
01:11:16,945 --> 01:11:20,805
Speaker 7:  you, you've seen these, these are the X reel glasses that are Yeah, with

1260
01:11:20,805 --> 01:11:23,925
Speaker 7:  the space top. I can't get them on right now. Those

1261
01:11:23,925 --> 01:11:25,125
Speaker 5:  Are pretty hot I have to say.

1262
01:11:25,355 --> 01:11:26,925
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I mean they look pretty sick John. I

1263
01:11:26,925 --> 01:11:29,285
Speaker 5:  Mean they look like Wayfarers but they are very, very chunky.

1264
01:11:30,475 --> 01:11:33,645
Speaker 7:  Yeah, they look awesome. Everyone here keeps telling me that I look like,

1265
01:11:33,665 --> 01:11:36,845
Speaker 7:  you know, one of those like, like glasses with a mustache.

1266
01:11:37,305 --> 01:11:39,165
Speaker 5:  But they have a cord that's a cord.

1267
01:11:39,235 --> 01:11:40,845
Speaker 7:  Yeah. The cord connects to the laptop.

1268
01:11:42,155 --> 01:11:45,085
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I'm gonna go ahead and say we're far away from air glasses.

1269
01:11:45,955 --> 01:11:49,645
Speaker 7:  I'll say the only use of those that I do like, there's everything

1270
01:11:49,695 --> 01:11:53,645
Speaker 7:  aside. I do like having multiple monitors when I don't ha when I'm away

1271
01:11:53,645 --> 01:11:54,205
Speaker 7:  from my computer.

1272
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:57,885
Speaker 6:  Yeah, that's fair. Joanna, you used to go and we should also take a break

1273
01:11:57,885 --> 01:12:01,805
Speaker 6:  here, but I, we have not heard what you think Johnny,

1274
01:12:01,985 --> 01:12:05,645
Speaker 6:  ive and OpenAI are building and we got a little bit of stuff this week. There

1275
01:12:05,645 --> 01:12:09,245
Speaker 6:  was like Johnny, ive did an interview with L Powell jobs talking about the

1276
01:12:09,365 --> 01:12:12,485
Speaker 6:  unintended consequences of the iPhone and how they wanted to fix all the

1277
01:12:12,775 --> 01:12:16,445
Speaker 6:  harms that smartphones have done and chat. GPT wants to be like a

1278
01:12:16,515 --> 01:12:19,325
Speaker 6:  universal life assistant, but we still don't know anything. What do you think

1279
01:12:19,325 --> 01:12:19,645
Speaker 6:  they're building?

1280
01:12:20,685 --> 01:12:23,125
Speaker 7:  I don't think they're building glasses. I mean they've basically said that,

1281
01:12:23,125 --> 01:12:26,925
Speaker 7:  right? I, there was a lot of chatter at Davos this year

1282
01:12:27,055 --> 01:12:30,765
Speaker 7:  there, like before this deal was announced, but there was a lot of

1283
01:12:30,765 --> 01:12:34,165
Speaker 7:  chatter already about the partnership between these two. Yes. And this Swiss

1284
01:12:34,165 --> 01:12:35,085
Speaker 7:  South everybody's

1285
01:12:35,085 --> 01:12:37,485
Speaker 6:  Clinking champagne glasses and talking about open eye.

1286
01:12:37,485 --> 01:12:40,405
Speaker 7:  Yeah. We're like, what are they building? What are they building? There was

1287
01:12:40,435 --> 01:12:43,965
Speaker 7:  chatter about the headphones, like earbuds with cameras or

1288
01:12:44,155 --> 01:12:47,405
Speaker 7:  like, which would make sense. But

1289
01:12:48,085 --> 01:12:51,845
Speaker 7:  I believe now like people have shifted and said they don't think that

1290
01:12:52,355 --> 01:12:54,405
Speaker 5:  I've been straight up told it's not headphones.

1291
01:12:55,045 --> 01:12:55,245
Speaker 6:  Interesting.

1292
01:12:55,475 --> 01:12:58,045
Speaker 5:  I'll just, I I don't think, I think it's like a, I think it's like a necklace.

1293
01:12:58,225 --> 01:13:01,245
Speaker 7:  Oh I hope it's not a necklace. But I will say, So I did a piece a few weeks

1294
01:13:01,305 --> 01:13:04,525
Speaker 7:  ago on these recording devices, Neil, I went to a dinner with me and I was

1295
01:13:04,525 --> 01:13:08,205
Speaker 7:  wearing the recording device. It's very weird. And I tested both the

1296
01:13:08,205 --> 01:13:11,845
Speaker 7:  Limitless and the B. These are both like AI recording devices. They listen

1297
01:13:11,985 --> 01:13:15,685
Speaker 7:  all the time and they summarize and make notes and to-do lists for you.

1298
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:20,005
Speaker 7:  And I will say there were some very positive

1299
01:13:20,915 --> 01:13:24,565
Speaker 7:  uses of those. So if they can figure out

1300
01:13:24,705 --> 01:13:28,685
Speaker 7:  the privacy stuff and they can do this in a smart way where like

1301
01:13:28,685 --> 01:13:32,405
Speaker 7:  you can talk to your chat GT assistant all the time, but it's also listening

1302
01:13:32,735 --> 01:13:33,365
Speaker 7:  maybe looking.

1303
01:13:34,995 --> 01:13:38,415
Speaker 7:  And again, they need to get the privacy stuff right. There's a lot of

1304
01:13:38,565 --> 01:13:39,895
Speaker 7:  potential there. But all

1305
01:13:39,895 --> 01:13:42,935
Speaker 5:  Those things had phone apps, right? The interface was a phone app.

1306
01:13:43,205 --> 01:13:44,255
Speaker 7:  They all had phone apps.

1307
01:13:44,355 --> 01:13:45,735
Speaker 5:  It was just a little piece of hardware.

1308
01:13:45,915 --> 01:13:48,895
Speaker 7:  But you don't have to like be looking at that. You just live your life with

1309
01:13:48,915 --> 01:13:50,975
Speaker 7:  the device listening all the time. Yeah.

1310
01:13:51,175 --> 01:13:54,335
Speaker 5:  I just don't think Johnny, Ivan and Sam Altman are building a device whose

1311
01:13:55,845 --> 01:13:59,695
Speaker 5:  fate lies with an iOS phone app. Yeah, yeah. Like that. That just seems

1312
01:13:59,695 --> 01:14:02,535
Speaker 5:  really hard to me. So by the way, it's all the same problems minus the display.

1313
01:14:02,535 --> 01:14:05,855
Speaker 5:  They need compute, they need connectivity and they need a battery. It needs

1314
01:14:05,855 --> 01:14:08,695
Speaker 5:  to be unobtrusive. And then I think they've got this other problem, which

1315
01:14:08,695 --> 01:14:12,605
Speaker 5:  is if at the end of the day the way that you set it up and use It is by

1316
01:14:12,765 --> 01:14:16,125
Speaker 5:  configuring it on an iOS device. Like, ooh, you, you've accomplished very

1317
01:14:16,125 --> 01:14:16,285
Speaker 5:  little.

1318
01:14:16,645 --> 01:14:20,125
Speaker 7:  I think that though, he said that in the video, he said that in the, I love

1319
01:14:20,145 --> 01:14:22,685
Speaker 7:  San Francisco, I wanna have sex with San Francisco video. Like

1320
01:14:22,785 --> 01:14:24,805
Speaker 5:  Why did this podcast get so horny in the past 10 minutes?

1321
01:14:24,845 --> 01:14:28,525
Speaker 7:  I know. Well I just, David dude, so we could say sex. So here we,

1322
01:14:28,805 --> 01:14:28,925
Speaker 7:  It is

1323
01:14:28,925 --> 01:14:30,365
Speaker 6:  The energy I bring. This is what we're doing.

1324
01:14:30,555 --> 01:14:33,285
Speaker 5:  Alright. Right. So Jony, Ive wants to bang San Francisco and he said something

1325
01:14:33,285 --> 01:14:34,325
Speaker 5:  about the iPhone during that time.

1326
01:14:34,555 --> 01:14:37,965
Speaker 7:  They said some, they said about the laptop and that we've moved beyond because

1327
01:14:37,965 --> 01:14:38,285
Speaker 7:  they're

1328
01:14:38,285 --> 01:14:39,365
Speaker 5:  Still this, they call those legacy products,

1329
01:14:39,545 --> 01:14:42,245
Speaker 7:  Legacy products that are still staples in your life. Like,

1330
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:45,645
Speaker 7:  I mean, I don't remember exact wording, I don't have the transcript, but

1331
01:14:45,645 --> 01:14:49,565
Speaker 7:  there was a, there was a lot of like implication. Like we're not gonna replace

1332
01:14:49,565 --> 01:14:52,645
Speaker 7:  those things. We will still have them. This is the new thing.

1333
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:56,025
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I don we'll see, I'm, I just, the only thing I know is

1334
01:14:56,785 --> 01:15:00,745
Speaker 5:  I, I've heard a lot of chatter about headphones and I was kind of told

1335
01:15:00,745 --> 01:15:03,665
Speaker 5:  it wasn't headphones and there's a lot of chatter about app pendant and I

1336
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:05,945
Speaker 5:  have no idea if it will be appendant. That's it. That's what I got. I love

1337
01:15:05,945 --> 01:15:07,065
Speaker 7:  An, I love a new necklace,

1338
01:15:07,085 --> 01:15:09,505
Speaker 5:  But I, I think they've got, I think they have to build something that does

1339
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:13,225
Speaker 5:  not rely on a phone. If they build basically a phone accessory, they,

1340
01:15:13,225 --> 01:15:14,625
Speaker 5:  they're, they're not gonna get to where they wanna go.

1341
01:15:14,925 --> 01:15:18,905
Speaker 7:  But then you have the same issues of the humane pen, which we, I you guys

1342
01:15:18,905 --> 01:15:22,025
Speaker 7:  have talked about, but like that had cellular built in and that was a big

1343
01:15:22,025 --> 01:15:25,905
Speaker 7:  problem. Yes, it was a big problem for that device. It might

1344
01:15:25,905 --> 01:15:28,705
Speaker 7:  have been the biggest problem for that device. There was a lot of it. Sorry,

1345
01:15:28,705 --> 01:15:29,145
Speaker 7:  let's not let's,

1346
01:15:29,145 --> 01:15:29,865
Speaker 6:  It's a long, it's

1347
01:15:56,775 --> 01:15:58,595
Speaker 7:  and I would be happy if they were

1348
01:19:48,715 --> 01:19:49,375
Speaker 8:  All right, we're back.

1349
01:19:50,615 --> 01:19:54,555
Speaker 5:  I'm excited to see Joanna in just mumbling to ChatGPT GBT in the corner of

1350
01:19:55,055 --> 01:19:56,955
Speaker 5:  WWC for a couple of days. It'll be good.

1351
01:19:57,145 --> 01:19:57,435
Speaker 8:  It's

1352
01:19:57,435 --> 01:20:00,715
Speaker 6:  Really like, give it to Joanna. She's like, she doesn't half-ass things,

1353
01:20:00,895 --> 01:20:04,475
Speaker 6:  you know what I mean? Like when Joanna decides to make AI her life,

1354
01:20:05,575 --> 01:20:06,195
Speaker 6:  she goes for it.

1355
01:20:06,205 --> 01:20:08,485
Speaker 5:  She's going for it. I mean, she's writing a book about it, making our lives.

1356
01:20:08,585 --> 01:20:09,365
Speaker 5:  So she's going for it.

1357
01:20:29,645 --> 01:20:33,365
Speaker 5:  That's the information. Still flavorful, I would say Very

1358
01:20:33,365 --> 01:20:36,725
Speaker 5:  flavorful. And in fact, I know it's gonna be flavorful 'cause David, it's

1359
01:20:36,725 --> 01:20:36,845
Speaker 5:  time.

1360
01:20:37,585 --> 01:20:41,525
Speaker 6:  Ugh. It is. It's once again it's summer, but It

1361
01:20:41,525 --> 01:20:45,125
Speaker 6:  is still time for America's favorite podcast. Within a podcast

1362
01:20:45,985 --> 01:20:49,265
Speaker 6:  future Webby award-winning podcast within a podcast.

1363
01:20:49,575 --> 01:20:53,105
Speaker 6:  Brendan Carr is a dummy. Eli, how does this keep happening? Like

1364
01:20:53,315 --> 01:20:56,745
Speaker 6:  every week I'm like, I, I have a line in the rundown that just says, Brendan

1365
01:20:56,745 --> 01:20:59,305
Speaker 6:  Carr is a dummy. And I'm like, oh God, there's not gonna be any links. This

1366
01:20:59,305 --> 01:21:02,705
Speaker 6:  is gonna be so great. We can finally not talk about this stupid man. And

1367
01:21:02,705 --> 01:21:04,425
Speaker 6:  yet here we are. We do this every time

1368
01:21:04,725 --> 01:21:08,025
Speaker 5:  We do and and there's no shortage of it. I will say this week usually

1369
01:21:08,525 --> 01:21:11,065
Speaker 5:  we get notes that are like, he's not a dummy, he's a threat to free speech.

1370
01:21:11,065 --> 01:21:14,465
Speaker 5:  And I I agree with those people. The thing is that he's also very stupid,

1371
01:21:15,035 --> 01:21:15,385
Speaker 6:  Right?

1372
01:21:15,555 --> 01:21:19,145
Speaker 5:  Right. So he, he does all these investigations and threatens the companies

1373
01:21:19,165 --> 01:21:22,345
Speaker 5:  for not being racist enough, threatening car stuff, stuff.

1374
01:21:23,125 --> 01:21:27,025
Speaker 5:  But he's also not good at executing or thinking more than

1375
01:21:27,025 --> 01:21:30,955
Speaker 5:  one step ahead. Right? He's a dummy. I i i, I

1376
01:21:30,955 --> 01:21:34,155
Speaker 5:  can't say this clearly enough. Brendan Carr, the chair of the Federal Communications

1377
01:21:34,155 --> 01:21:38,035
Speaker 5:  Commission aren't the regulator in charge of our nation's communications

1378
01:21:38,035 --> 01:21:41,995
Speaker 5:  infrastructure is a dummy. And sometimes it

1379
01:21:41,995 --> 01:21:45,915
Speaker 5:  just expresses itself because, well the only thing he succeeds in doing

1380
01:21:45,915 --> 01:21:49,875
Speaker 5:  is shooting himself in the foot. And I think it's starting to,

1381
01:21:49,935 --> 01:21:53,435
Speaker 5:  to weigh, unlike the other people at the

1382
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:55,495
Speaker 5:  FCC, 'cause they're all quitting.

1383
01:21:57,335 --> 01:22:01,075
Speaker 5:  So we're down, we're supposed to have five FCC commissioners. And

1384
01:22:01,195 --> 01:22:04,115
Speaker 5:  depending on the president's party, you're supposed to have three of the

1385
01:22:04,275 --> 01:22:07,795
Speaker 5:  majority party and two of the minority. Right. And then, you know, you kind

1386
01:22:07,795 --> 01:22:09,955
Speaker 5:  of, the votes go either way. But you have this like bipartisan

1387
01:22:11,495 --> 01:22:14,675
Speaker 5:  agency committee that like, makes decisions altogether and ideally they make

1388
01:22:14,675 --> 01:22:17,995
Speaker 5:  unanimously 'cause they've done the hard work of hashing out good policy

1389
01:22:18,065 --> 01:22:19,915
Speaker 5:  from both sides. You know, stuff.

1390
01:22:20,265 --> 01:22:20,555
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

1391
01:22:20,725 --> 01:22:23,715
Speaker 5:  Government stuff, government stuff. The thing you're supposed to do. Brendan

1392
01:22:23,775 --> 01:22:27,115
Speaker 5:  is such a dummy that he's not doing that at all, where he's just like issuing

1393
01:22:27,115 --> 01:22:30,755
Speaker 5:  proclamations about how there should be more censorship in America or whatever

1394
01:22:30,755 --> 01:22:34,595
Speaker 5:  he wants. And I, I, I don know what he's doing. So this

1395
01:22:34,595 --> 01:22:38,515
Speaker 5:  week, two different FCC commissioners from different

1396
01:22:38,515 --> 01:22:42,435
Speaker 5:  parties just resigned. Jeffrey Starks, who has been on the Rich House before

1397
01:22:42,435 --> 01:22:46,395
Speaker 5:  as a guest Democratic commissioner, quit goodbye. I think he, people

1398
01:22:46,395 --> 01:22:49,475
Speaker 5:  kind of knew he was gonna leave, but he's gone. And then surprisingly, Nathan

1399
01:22:49,545 --> 01:22:53,075
Speaker 5:  Simington, who is sort of just like another

1400
01:22:53,375 --> 01:22:57,035
Speaker 5:  to like another revolving door, Verizon

1401
01:22:57,215 --> 01:23:00,515
Speaker 5:  to, he's just been there for a while. He was an assistant to, to pie in,

1402
01:23:00,535 --> 01:23:03,835
Speaker 5:  in car in different ways. And then he became a commissioner. He bailed too.

1403
01:23:04,135 --> 01:23:07,455
Speaker 6:  He was appointed by Trump in the, in the first Trump administration, wasn't

1404
01:23:07,455 --> 01:23:08,695
Speaker 6:  he? Yep. Yeah. Cool.

1405
01:23:08,775 --> 01:23:10,935
Speaker 5:  I don't have, I don't have a high opinion. These guys are all just sort of

1406
01:23:10,935 --> 01:23:14,255
Speaker 5:  like, we're here to do what the cable companies tell us. Do like fine, like

1407
01:23:14,405 --> 01:23:18,215
Speaker 5:  your, your interchangeable util But you would think that he'd be riding high

1408
01:23:18,755 --> 01:23:22,695
Speaker 5:  in a car FCC 'cause you know, he gets rubber stamp stuff

1409
01:23:22,695 --> 01:23:26,415
Speaker 5:  too. Yeah. But, but no, he's, he's gone and it, the, the reports are

1410
01:23:26,895 --> 01:23:30,575
Speaker 5:  that he wants to do other things. Presumably he's gonna go work for one of

1411
01:23:30,575 --> 01:23:33,535
Speaker 5:  our nation's telecoms like that revolving door is just gonna spin really

1412
01:23:33,535 --> 01:23:37,055
Speaker 5:  fast and spit out millions of dollars in lobbying fees. And Nathan Une is

1413
01:23:37,055 --> 01:23:40,835
Speaker 5:  gonna collect them. I know this is what happens to all of them. It's a lot

1414
01:23:41,175 --> 01:23:45,075
Speaker 5:  gpi the CEO of our nation's preeminent wireless industry lobby right now.

1415
01:23:45,535 --> 01:23:48,675
Speaker 5:  That's, that's how it goes. But, so we're down to two. We're supposed to

1416
01:23:48,675 --> 01:23:51,795
Speaker 5:  have five in a Trump administration. You have three Republicans and two Democrats.

1417
01:23:52,055 --> 01:23:55,995
Speaker 5:  And we're down to one Democrat, Anna Gomez, who's literally touring the company

1418
01:23:56,175 --> 01:23:59,875
Speaker 5:  saying that Brendan Carr is a threat to democracy and free speech right now.

1419
01:24:00,855 --> 01:24:03,155
Speaker 6:  And it's also like operating under the assumption that she's going to be

1420
01:24:03,155 --> 01:24:03,915
Speaker 6:  fired at any minute.

1421
01:24:04,115 --> 01:24:05,155
Speaker 5:  I think. I think she's trying to get fired.

1422
01:24:05,505 --> 01:24:05,795
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

1423
01:24:06,615 --> 01:24:09,435
Speaker 5:  So, and to, to prove a point, which is I think one of the reasons they're

1424
01:24:09,435 --> 01:24:13,185
Speaker 5:  not firing. What if it's just Brendan? Do you see what I'm saying?

1425
01:24:13,565 --> 01:24:16,945
Speaker 5:  And then there's Brendan, oh my God. And he's, he's pushed everyone else

1426
01:24:17,045 --> 01:24:20,545
Speaker 5:  out. And the government is such a disaster now. 'cause Elon and Trump are

1427
01:24:20,665 --> 01:24:23,665
Speaker 5:  fighting that like there's no chance we're gonna nominate

1428
01:24:24,575 --> 01:24:28,545
Speaker 5:  four more FCC commissioners, two of whom have to be Democrats

1429
01:24:29,235 --> 01:24:30,935
Speaker 5:  by by statute. Yeah. Like It is not gonna

1430
01:24:30,935 --> 01:24:31,575
Speaker 6:  Happen. No.

1431
01:24:32,205 --> 01:24:35,765
Speaker 5:  So we're, we're down to Brendan and Anna. I, they don't even, they don't

1432
01:24:35,765 --> 01:24:38,805
Speaker 5:  even have like a quorum. Like they can't do anything anymore because they

1433
01:24:38,805 --> 01:24:39,485
Speaker 5:  don't have enough of them.

1434
01:24:39,855 --> 01:24:43,005
Speaker 6:  Right? 'cause they'll just, they'll just, it'll be one-to-one on everything

1435
01:24:43,025 --> 01:24:43,965
Speaker 6:  and then they just

1436
01:24:43,965 --> 01:24:47,085
Speaker 5:  Leave. And there's a lot of stuff to get done. Like there's BroadB broadband

1437
01:24:47,185 --> 01:24:51,005
Speaker 5:  to roll out in America. There's spectrum auctions to be held. Like there's

1438
01:24:51,005 --> 01:24:54,725
Speaker 5:  all this stuff to do. And Brendan is so distasteful and so stupid

1439
01:24:54,725 --> 01:24:58,525
Speaker 5:  that he, you know, Brendan his way into not having

1440
01:24:58,645 --> 01:25:02,285
Speaker 5:  a functional FCC, very good Brendan, you succeeded

1441
01:25:02,705 --> 01:25:06,605
Speaker 5:  and the only other person who works there now hates you so much that she's

1442
01:25:06,605 --> 01:25:09,485
Speaker 5:  literally touring the country calling you a threat to free speech.

1443
01:25:10,665 --> 01:25:14,035
Speaker 5:  Well done. Just in, when I think of like pure

1444
01:25:14,065 --> 01:25:17,635
Speaker 5:  political operators, you know, like people who like really

1445
01:25:17,865 --> 01:25:20,875
Speaker 5:  just like work the system. Like they're playing a video game.

1446
01:25:21,785 --> 01:25:25,435
Speaker 5:  It's not Brendan Carr like I, whatever this is, is not bad outcome.

1447
01:25:25,855 --> 01:25:29,495
Speaker 5:  So that's one very funny, just like pure idiocy.

1448
01:25:29,795 --> 01:25:32,815
Speaker 5:  So distasteful that everyone else quit, including the other Republican who

1449
01:25:32,815 --> 01:25:36,695
Speaker 5:  is himself kind of a Toby. Insane. So then there's like,

1450
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:40,055
Speaker 5:  this one is a winding road, but it might be even funnier.

1451
01:25:41,445 --> 01:25:45,345
Speaker 5:  So you will recall Brendan launched an investigation

1452
01:25:45,495 --> 01:25:49,265
Speaker 5:  into Dish network's use of spectrum to build a,

1453
01:25:49,385 --> 01:25:53,345
Speaker 5:  a what was supposed to be a Na Nation's fourth wireless network. And

1454
01:25:53,345 --> 01:25:56,225
Speaker 5:  he said, you're not using the spectrum. I'll come to why they are not using

1455
01:25:56,225 --> 01:25:59,625
Speaker 5:  that spectrum. But the reason he launched that investigation is because

1456
01:25:59,865 --> 01:26:03,605
Speaker 5:  starlink put out a report saying it had investigated dish all by

1457
01:26:03,605 --> 01:26:07,085
Speaker 5:  itself and they weren't using the spectrum. Right. That is just corruption.

1458
01:26:07,085 --> 01:26:09,925
Speaker 5:  That's not how that's supposed to work Straightforwardly. That's not how

1459
01:26:09,925 --> 01:26:12,525
Speaker 5:  that's supposed to work. You're not like, oh, starlink has a good point.

1460
01:26:12,705 --> 01:26:15,285
Speaker 5:  We should trust them and take the spectrum away from another private company.

1461
01:26:15,745 --> 01:26:19,605
Speaker 5:  I'm doing a great job, says me. It's like, so that they launched

1462
01:26:19,605 --> 01:26:23,565
Speaker 5:  this investigation. Now I believe wholeheartedly the Dish network

1463
01:26:23,625 --> 01:26:27,245
Speaker 5:  is not using the spectrum appropriately because it turns out there is not

1464
01:26:27,245 --> 01:26:31,205
Speaker 5:  a fourth wireless network in America. Correct. If you see it, if

1465
01:26:31,205 --> 01:26:34,925
Speaker 5:  you see the fourth nationwide wireless network that is

1466
01:26:35,485 --> 01:26:39,255
Speaker 5:  striking fear in a T-Mobile, you let me know. But I, I've looked around

1467
01:26:40,525 --> 01:26:43,145
Speaker 5:  and by look around I meant waved my phone in the sky.

1468
01:26:44,215 --> 01:26:47,865
Speaker 5:  However you look around it's not there. It's not there. It's supposed to

1469
01:26:47,865 --> 01:26:51,385
Speaker 5:  be there because Brendan's predecessor, a Jet Pi allowed

1470
01:26:51,985 --> 01:26:55,345
Speaker 5:  T-Mobile to buy Sprint consolidating the wireless industry, robber stamping

1471
01:26:55,345 --> 01:26:59,065
Speaker 5:  some telecom stuff. This is what these guys do. And made them promise

1472
01:26:59,185 --> 01:27:03,025
Speaker 5:  they would turn over Spectrum to EchoStar Dish Network and they would light

1473
01:27:03,025 --> 01:27:06,865
Speaker 5:  up a fourth wireless network, a 5G network. And EchoStar made

1474
01:27:06,865 --> 01:27:10,145
Speaker 5:  all these promises about how they were gonna take over Boost and then use

1475
01:27:10,145 --> 01:27:13,825
Speaker 5:  these MVNO agreements with at and t and T-Mobile and use that to

1476
01:27:13,825 --> 01:27:17,585
Speaker 5:  bootstrap a network while they built cutting Edge

1477
01:27:18,095 --> 01:27:21,945
Speaker 5:  5G network using open ran technologies running on

1478
01:27:21,945 --> 01:27:25,305
Speaker 5:  AWS. We've covered this at length and a G Pi

1479
01:27:26,065 --> 01:27:29,785
Speaker 5:  hoodwinked fully into believing this and said, okay, we're gonna let

1480
01:27:29,905 --> 01:27:32,465
Speaker 5:  T-Mobile by Sprint, we're gonna cut the amount of competition in America

1481
01:27:32,465 --> 01:27:36,385
Speaker 5:  and wireless. Sure. Prices go up, dish Network, we'll show up to save the

1482
01:27:36,505 --> 01:27:39,905
Speaker 5:  day and restore competition. It is 100 years later they have 20

1483
01:27:40,305 --> 01:27:42,625
Speaker 5:  subscribers. They still run Boost Mobile, but they're constantly roaming

1484
01:27:42,625 --> 01:27:46,465
Speaker 5:  onto at and t. None of this exists. Just none of this exists. This is

1485
01:27:46,465 --> 01:27:48,745
Speaker 5:  failed Republican policy from the first Trump administration.

1486
01:27:50,385 --> 01:27:54,235
Speaker 5:  Okay. Starlink has said they're not using the spectrum. We'd like it.

1487
01:27:54,935 --> 01:27:58,235
Speaker 5:  No process. Brendan's like, yeah, I'll give it to my buddy. Elon. Elon has

1488
01:27:58,235 --> 01:28:01,985
Speaker 5:  now fallen completely out with Trump. Like as we are speaking,

1489
01:28:02,095 --> 01:28:04,985
Speaker 5:  they continue to tweet at each other. Yep. About how much they hate each

1490
01:28:04,985 --> 01:28:08,825
Speaker 5:  other. It that seems like a poor political move from Brendan who

1491
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:12,615
Speaker 5:  can't see two feet in front of his face and EchoStar Dish

1492
01:28:12,615 --> 01:28:16,575
Speaker 5:  network. What have they decided to start doing? They're gonna start missing

1493
01:28:16,865 --> 01:28:20,495
Speaker 5:  their interest payments on the loans they took out for the spectrum so they

1494
01:28:20,495 --> 01:28:24,095
Speaker 5:  can declare bankruptcy and get out of this whole deal. Wow.

1495
01:28:24,205 --> 01:28:27,655
Speaker 5:  They're actively missing their payments on the spectrum now. And they're

1496
01:28:27,655 --> 01:28:30,815
Speaker 5:  doing it in response to this investigation. They're saying, you investigated

1497
01:28:30,815 --> 01:28:34,515
Speaker 5:  us, we're we're headed for the exit. So Brandon,

1498
01:28:35,295 --> 01:28:39,275
Speaker 5:  who again threw his lain with Elon Musk to, to take Spectrum from a company

1499
01:28:39,275 --> 01:28:42,475
Speaker 5:  that wasn't using it under a plan that his own predecessor launched,

1500
01:28:43,395 --> 01:28:46,775
Speaker 5:  has now put himself on the wrong side of Donald Trump, his putative boss.

1501
01:28:47,435 --> 01:28:50,935
Speaker 5:  And in a position where EchoStar might outplay him by just declaring

1502
01:28:50,935 --> 01:28:54,535
Speaker 5:  bankruptcy, we will still not get a fourth wireless network in America out

1503
01:28:54,535 --> 01:28:58,415
Speaker 5:  of this super. Not gonna happen, but we'll burn a bunch of money in

1504
01:28:58,415 --> 01:29:01,245
Speaker 5:  jobs in the process. We're gonna burn a bunch of money in Jobs. Jobs. And

1505
01:29:01,245 --> 01:29:05,085
Speaker 5:  I, I think Brendan has, because he's so dumb, didn't see the

1506
01:29:05,085 --> 01:29:08,605
Speaker 5:  two moves ahead of him that perhaps Charlie

1507
01:29:08,925 --> 01:29:12,765
Speaker 5:  Ergen, the, the CEO of EchoStar, the parent of Dish would have another card

1508
01:29:12,785 --> 01:29:16,165
Speaker 5:  to play. He's just a moron. Right.

1509
01:29:16,395 --> 01:29:17,405
Speaker 6:  This is just what we're doing here.

1510
01:29:17,665 --> 01:29:20,405
Speaker 5:  That's been Brendan Carr's dummy. It is always Brendan, if you can show up

1511
01:29:20,405 --> 01:29:23,085
Speaker 5:  on the podcast and defend these moves or any others, you, you're welcome

1512
01:29:23,085 --> 01:29:26,955
Speaker 5:  to come. We, we'd love to have you, dude, you're not doing

1513
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:28,715
Speaker 5:  anything else. All of your coworkers quit.

1514
01:29:29,305 --> 01:29:33,115
Speaker 6:  There's literally no one else. Anna Gomez is on tour. Go on tour, go on

1515
01:29:33,115 --> 01:29:35,475
Speaker 6:  tour to The Vergecast. That's, this is what we asked for.

1516
01:29:35,585 --> 01:29:39,475
Speaker 5:  Make, make the case that you didn't just get thoroughly outplayed by

1517
01:29:39,475 --> 01:29:43,435
Speaker 5:  like a Wildcat satellite operator who's gonna declare bankruptcy

1518
01:29:43,895 --> 01:29:47,635
Speaker 5:  and you're gonna have to resell the spectrum and you're probably not gonna

1519
01:29:47,635 --> 01:29:49,395
Speaker 5:  be able to just give it to starlink the way they want.

1520
01:29:50,655 --> 01:29:54,415
Speaker 6:  I also, I I was just reading Brendan Carr's blog post

1521
01:29:54,595 --> 01:29:58,575
Speaker 6:  on the FCC website that he wrote sort of announcing these changes.

1522
01:30:00,655 --> 01:30:01,625
Speaker 6:  He's just so annoying.

1523
01:30:02,895 --> 01:30:03,185
Speaker 5:  Like,

1524
01:30:03,235 --> 01:30:06,385
Speaker 6:  Lemme just read you a paragraph. There's a lot of time between now and our

1525
01:30:06,385 --> 01:30:09,465
Speaker 6:  scheduled June 26th commission meeting. So I wanted to lay out a couple of

1526
01:30:09,465 --> 01:30:12,265
Speaker 6:  items that I would like to get done at the meeting if we can stay tuned on

1527
01:30:12,265 --> 01:30:16,105
Speaker 6:  that front. What does he mean by that? I just said stay tuned. That's all.

1528
01:30:16,505 --> 01:30:16,945
Speaker 6:  I just read

1529
01:30:17,065 --> 01:30:20,105
Speaker 5:  Words. No, that's what he wrote. That's what he wrote. I, none of that was

1530
01:30:20,105 --> 01:30:21,545
Speaker 5:  me. What does he mean by that? In the third person

1531
01:30:21,545 --> 01:30:24,385
Speaker 6:  He wrote, stay tuned on that front and then in italics, what does he mean

1532
01:30:24,385 --> 01:30:27,985
Speaker 6:  by that? And italics, I just said stay tuned. We always make a final decision

1533
01:30:27,985 --> 01:30:30,665
Speaker 6:  about the commission meeting and its agenda closer to the meeting date. We

1534
01:30:30,665 --> 01:30:33,905
Speaker 6:  will do so again here. That's a whole paragraph of no words.

1535
01:30:35,495 --> 01:30:36,745
Speaker 6:  What are we doing, Brandon?

1536
01:30:37,655 --> 01:30:40,785
Speaker 5:  He's, again, he's not smart. I I I know a lot of people are like, you should

1537
01:30:40,785 --> 01:30:44,505
Speaker 5:  call the segment something else. You know, you should really, we we do get

1538
01:30:44,505 --> 01:30:47,665
Speaker 5:  this note. Yeah. You should really make sure that people understand the threat.

1539
01:30:47,815 --> 01:30:51,185
Speaker 5:  Yeah. There's some threats. I've called him a traitorous more on many times

1540
01:30:52,085 --> 01:30:54,865
Speaker 5:  on our podcast, which is not regulated by the FCC Sorry buddy,

1541
01:30:55,915 --> 01:30:59,695
Speaker 5:  but he's just stupid. Yeah. And like you, you see it

1542
01:30:59,695 --> 01:31:03,495
Speaker 5:  play out. Like he doesn't, he can't think two moves ahead. Anyway, again,

1543
01:31:03,495 --> 01:31:06,935
Speaker 5:  I repeat Brendan, you're, you're welcome. I know you listen, I, I know that

1544
01:31:06,995 --> 01:31:10,735
Speaker 5:  you hate it. If you can show up, you can show up on decoder. You know, people

1545
01:31:10,735 --> 01:31:13,975
Speaker 5:  come on decoder all the time. They answer their questions, they do their

1546
01:31:13,975 --> 01:31:17,935
Speaker 5:  best. They leave, you know, they can show up here. David will tell some jokes

1547
01:31:17,935 --> 01:31:18,895
Speaker 5:  about you to your face.

1548
01:31:20,605 --> 01:31:24,095
Speaker 6:  I'll just read him blog posts. You can yell at him. I'll just edit his writing

1549
01:31:24,115 --> 01:31:25,455
Speaker 6:  on his stupid website.

1550
01:31:27,115 --> 01:31:30,215
Speaker 5:  Anyhow, that's been Brennan Carr's dummy America's favorite podcast with

1551
01:31:30,215 --> 01:31:30,575
Speaker 5:  him. Podcast.

1552
01:31:31,205 --> 01:31:31,975
Speaker 6:  That was beautiful.

1553
01:31:32,185 --> 01:31:34,735
Speaker 5:  David, I think we need a, we need a little bit of a pal cleanser that we

1554
01:31:34,735 --> 01:31:34,855
Speaker 5:  gotta

1555
01:31:35,355 --> 01:31:36,855
Speaker 6:  You wanna talk about the Fedi verse for a minute?

1556
01:31:37,045 --> 01:31:38,895
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I would love to. That's my favorite thing.

1557
01:31:39,355 --> 01:31:43,255
Speaker 6:  So Fed Forum, which is like a big fedi verse

1558
01:31:43,425 --> 01:31:47,415
Speaker 6:  event is this week, but did you see the, the news

1559
01:31:47,415 --> 01:31:48,575
Speaker 6:  about this tool called Bounce?

1560
01:31:49,035 --> 01:31:51,135
Speaker 5:  Oh this is the one that lets you move, move things around?

1561
01:31:51,365 --> 01:31:55,295
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so Bounce is basically, it's, it's pretty

1562
01:31:55,495 --> 01:31:59,325
Speaker 6:  straightforwardly just like a migration tool from Blue Sky

1563
01:31:59,325 --> 01:32:00,085
Speaker 6:  to Mastodon.

1564
01:32:02,485 --> 01:32:05,945
Speaker 6:  Not all that exciting. It's built on top of this thing called, I think it's

1565
01:32:05,945 --> 01:32:09,705
Speaker 6:  called Bridge Fed, which is some like underlying work that ties the two things

1566
01:32:09,945 --> 01:32:13,865
Speaker 6:  together. But it basically, it connects these two accounts so that

1567
01:32:13,865 --> 01:32:17,825
Speaker 6:  you can move all of your stuff from one to

1568
01:32:17,825 --> 01:32:21,425
Speaker 6:  the other and still be able to post where you were. This is like, this is

1569
01:32:21,425 --> 01:32:24,425
Speaker 6:  the stuff, right? It's just like every once in a while we get an announcement

1570
01:32:24,845 --> 01:32:27,745
Speaker 6:  or a new product or a thing that people are explaining that It is like

1571
01:32:28,695 --> 01:32:31,865
Speaker 6:  this is the stuff, this is the, yeah. What we're doing when we talk about

1572
01:32:31,865 --> 01:32:35,825
Speaker 6:  the Fedi verse and like bounce a in the fact that It is kind of

1573
01:32:35,825 --> 01:32:39,745
Speaker 6:  messy to explain. And the reason they call it bounce is because

1574
01:32:39,745 --> 01:32:42,985
Speaker 6:  they're trying to get you to bounce from blue sky to Mastodon, which is like

1575
01:32:42,985 --> 01:32:43,465
Speaker 6:  pretty good,

1576
01:32:45,155 --> 01:32:48,935
Speaker 6:  but it's like the idea that I can just pick up my stuff on a social

1577
01:32:48,935 --> 01:32:52,855
Speaker 6:  network and put it down on another social network. Like, that's it baby.

1578
01:32:52,855 --> 01:32:55,895
Speaker 6:  That's the stuff. Yeah. And we're like starting to see this,

1579
01:32:56,085 --> 01:32:59,895
Speaker 5:  There's a bunch of stuff out of Feta Forum where it's like new ways of

1580
01:32:59,895 --> 01:33:03,575
Speaker 5:  thinking about the protocols. I really, broadly, I think we spent the last

1581
01:33:03,605 --> 01:33:06,775
Speaker 5:  year or so talking about capabilities,

1582
01:33:07,445 --> 01:33:10,335
Speaker 5:  like here's some technologies that will enable capabilities and the Fed versus

1583
01:33:10,695 --> 01:33:13,095
Speaker 5:  absolutely that thing. Activity, pub, app, protocol, whatever. It's like,

1584
01:33:13,405 --> 01:33:16,815
Speaker 5:  look at these core technologies and you gotta build them. And now, and same

1585
01:33:16,815 --> 01:33:20,695
Speaker 5:  as rave, look at these models and now they can lie to you. And now we're

1586
01:33:20,695 --> 01:33:24,615
Speaker 5:  in the products phase and like you can see the Federalist products are, are

1587
01:33:24,615 --> 01:33:25,975
Speaker 5:  coming pretty fast and furious now.

1588
01:33:26,155 --> 01:33:29,935
Speaker 6:  It it's taking a little longer than I would've hoped. I will say

1589
01:33:30,055 --> 01:33:33,575
Speaker 6:  I think there's been, that was so much energy

1590
01:33:34,535 --> 01:33:37,295
Speaker 6:  18 months ago that I think got a little bit

1591
01:33:38,545 --> 01:33:42,445
Speaker 6:  wasted, is too strong, but didn't quite get fully utilized. And I

1592
01:33:42,445 --> 01:33:45,765
Speaker 6:  think a lot of people were excited about what Threads is doing. And the,

1593
01:33:45,785 --> 01:33:48,885
Speaker 6:  the threads fed averse momentum seems to have slowed pretty aggressively.

1594
01:33:48,885 --> 01:33:52,645
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Blue Sky is doing great. Blue Sky is a version of the

1595
01:33:52,645 --> 01:33:55,765
Speaker 6:  Fedi verse, but is not sort of the whole story in a way. So it's like

1596
01:33:56,465 --> 01:33:59,245
Speaker 6:  we, we continue to be like right at the edge of the thing, but I think you're

1597
01:33:59,245 --> 01:34:02,205
Speaker 6:  right that the answer is just people just have to start building things people

1598
01:34:02,205 --> 01:34:05,085
Speaker 6:  like to use. Yeah. And then, and then we're gonna start to be there and It

1599
01:34:05,085 --> 01:34:09,005
Speaker 6:  is like every, every version of this that comes

1600
01:34:09,005 --> 01:34:12,125
Speaker 6:  out where it's like we're, we're getting another piece of the puzzle together.

1601
01:34:12,825 --> 01:34:16,205
Speaker 6:  And I think especially the stuff that touches Blue Sky, because that's just,

1602
01:34:16,235 --> 01:34:19,405
Speaker 6:  it's just the one with the juice right now. Right. And so like any piece

1603
01:34:19,405 --> 01:34:22,765
Speaker 6:  of it that is like, let me just attach a little bit of the open web to Blue

1604
01:34:22,785 --> 01:34:26,765
Speaker 6:  Sky, I think is, is super exciting. And I suspect there

1605
01:34:26,765 --> 01:34:30,485
Speaker 6:  will be more stuff coming out of the, the Feta forum. There was a lot of

1606
01:34:30,485 --> 01:34:34,285
Speaker 6:  news at the last one. I suspect there'll be more this time. But It is like

1607
01:34:35,065 --> 01:34:38,685
Speaker 6:  the, the momentum is still there. I just wish it were like shipping a little

1608
01:34:38,685 --> 01:34:39,685
Speaker 6:  faster, you know what I mean?

1609
01:34:40,245 --> 01:34:44,125
Speaker 5:  I feel like there was a, the momentum slowed because you had the VHS

1610
01:34:44,125 --> 01:34:48,085
Speaker 5:  versus beta moment with at Protocol and mast on and Activity

1611
01:34:48,105 --> 01:34:50,685
Speaker 5:  Pub and Threads. Yeah. And everyone thought threads are just make activity

1612
01:34:50,705 --> 01:34:53,325
Speaker 5:  pub win and Then it turns out Meta runs it.

1613
01:34:54,475 --> 01:34:54,765
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

1614
01:34:55,185 --> 01:34:56,485
Speaker 5:  And that just made

1615
01:35:23,695 --> 01:35:24,735
Speaker 5:  pick VHS for paid

1616
01:35:52,055 --> 01:35:55,795
Speaker 6:  is like everything is just going to be feeds. Yeah. And you can create feeds

1617
01:35:55,795 --> 01:35:58,395
Speaker 6:  from anywhere. You can consume feeds from anywhere and feeds can be anything.

1618
01:35:58,535 --> 01:36:02,515
Speaker 6:  And it's like, that is an incredibly powerful idea that we have like only

1619
01:36:02,665 --> 01:36:06,275
Speaker 6:  just begun exploring. And So I think every, again, every, every piece of

1620
01:36:06,275 --> 01:36:08,195
Speaker 6:  that that I see, I'm like, this is, this is the stuff.

1621
01:36:08,545 --> 01:36:12,275
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's gonna get there. Yeah. The this is, it's it's product

1622
01:36:12,275 --> 01:36:15,675
Speaker 5:  time. You gotta, you gotta make some products, everybody. Yeah. It'd be great

1623
01:36:15,675 --> 01:36:18,635
Speaker 5:  if Apple's like, we're gonna do a full hour on the Fedi verse. That's

1624
01:36:18,635 --> 01:36:21,195
Speaker 6:  Best. We're bringing back ping's. Sure. And it's the Fedi verse this time.

1625
01:36:21,695 --> 01:36:25,435
Speaker 5:  That'd be great. All right. We are at WWC next week. We'll have lots of that.

1626
01:36:25,655 --> 01:36:27,875
Speaker 5:  We have lots of switch coverage to come, but

1627
01:36:27,875 --> 01:36:31,675
Speaker 6:  We should say, by the way, our, our WWC episode is going to be late on Tuesday

1628
01:36:32,105 --> 01:36:35,435
Speaker 6:  just because the way WWDC works. We're not gonna get to record until late

1629
01:36:35,435 --> 01:36:39,395
Speaker 6:  on Monday. And then we will, we will have it as up as early as we can on

1630
01:36:39,395 --> 01:36:42,355
Speaker 6:  Tuesday. But if you're like waiting for the episode for your morning commute,

1631
01:36:42,905 --> 01:36:45,715
Speaker 6:  just know that I'm sorry. And it will be an afternoon commute kind of show

1632
01:36:45,715 --> 01:36:46,275
Speaker 6:  for you. Yeah.

1633
01:36:46,595 --> 01:36:49,955
Speaker 5:  I mean, have to get to a hotel room and record the episode after wwc. Exactly.
