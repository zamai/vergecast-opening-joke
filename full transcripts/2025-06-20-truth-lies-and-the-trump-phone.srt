Description: Starting a wireless carrier is easier than you might think. So is building a half-decent Android phone! But doing all the things Trump Mobile promises, at the price and on the schedule it says, seems awfully close to impossible. While Nilay's out, David and Jake chat with The Verge's Dominic Preston about what we know about Trump Mobile and the T1 Phone, why everyone wants to be a wireless carrier, and what it would actually take for this to work out. After that, David and Jake talk through some big news in the TV world, and the streaming takeover that appears to be happening faster all the time. Finally, in the lightning round, it's time for some brief FCC news, a check on the state of Siri, big questions about the ad-rich future of WhatsApp, a look at the new fediverse feed in Threads, and some thoughts on the Framework Laptop 12.


2
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:48,655
Speaker 4:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of phones. That

3
00:01:48,795 --> 00:01:52,615
Speaker 4:  for sure definitely do not exist. It, it just doesn't exist.

4
00:01:52,815 --> 00:01:55,535
Speaker 4:  I don't know what to say. It just does not exist. But we're gonna talk about

5
00:01:55,535 --> 00:01:59,055
Speaker 4:  this. I'm m your friend David Pierce. Jake AKIs is here. Hi, Jake. Hey,

6
00:01:59,055 --> 00:01:59,495
Speaker 5:  Good to be

7
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:03,015
Speaker 4:  Here. Your microphone works, your headphones work. The camera works.

8
00:02:03,595 --> 00:02:07,455
Speaker 4:  People should know that this is a small miracle we've accomplished to make

9
00:02:07,455 --> 00:02:08,655
Speaker 4:  this happen. It is. I

10
00:02:08,655 --> 00:02:12,175
Speaker 5:  Have some fancy technical wizardry that I've just learned that

11
00:02:12,535 --> 00:02:16,335
Speaker 5:  I, I can, can do in this room. So we'll see. We'll see if it comes up later.

12
00:02:16,445 --> 00:02:20,015
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's gonna get weird in here. Dom Preston's also here. Hi Dom.

13
00:02:20,395 --> 00:02:24,295
Speaker 4:  Hey, happy to be here. We have brought you here late in the day

14
00:02:24,665 --> 00:02:28,215
Speaker 4:  where you are. You're, you're in the uk. It's late, it's the evening,

15
00:02:29,635 --> 00:02:32,655
Speaker 4:  but, but Trump mobile exists and we have to talk about it. Do you know what

16
00:02:32,655 --> 00:02:35,975
Speaker 4:  I mean? Like, it's just that these are the rules. I don't make them, I just

17
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:39,335
Speaker 4:  abide by them. So we have a lot of news to talk about today. We're gonna

18
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:42,575
Speaker 4:  talk about, there's a bunch of interesting streaming stuff happening. I,

19
00:02:42,775 --> 00:02:46,655
Speaker 4:  I think this is like a sort of moment in the history of the

20
00:02:46,655 --> 00:02:50,575
Speaker 4:  television industry that we're gonna talk about some stuff on Siri,

21
00:02:51,165 --> 00:02:54,775
Speaker 4:  some interesting politics news. Whatsapp got ads and

22
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:57,095
Speaker 4:  everybody's having a lot of feelings about it. But we gotta start with Trump

23
00:02:57,095 --> 00:03:01,045
Speaker 4:  Mobile. We the, there, there is a phone, it's called

24
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:04,205
Speaker 4:  the Trump Mobile T one phone 8,002.

25
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:09,045
Speaker 4:  A fact that gives me a great number of questions. And then there

26
00:03:09,045 --> 00:03:12,885
Speaker 4:  is Trump Mobile, the wireless carrier. Dom, you,

27
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:16,365
Speaker 4:  you wrote the original story for us when, when Trump mobile came up, kind

28
00:03:16,365 --> 00:03:19,605
Speaker 4:  of out of nowhere. Do you wanna explain what this thing is? What did the

29
00:03:19,605 --> 00:03:21,445
Speaker 4:  Trump organization actually launch this week?

30
00:03:22,345 --> 00:03:26,245
Speaker 6:  So they've launched two things. It came almost out of nowhere. There'd been

31
00:03:26,245 --> 00:03:29,325
Speaker 6:  some trademark applications a few days prior. So we kind of had an inkling,

32
00:03:29,495 --> 00:03:32,405
Speaker 6:  maybe they're working on this, but in that like long term, maybe we'll see

33
00:03:32,405 --> 00:03:35,965
Speaker 6:  something eventually. And then all of a sudden, an hour after we published

34
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:39,685
Speaker 6:  the story there. The other thing was, so there's two parts to this.

35
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:43,485
Speaker 6:  There's a network, Trump Mobile, which is offering a

36
00:03:43,485 --> 00:03:47,445
Speaker 6:  single plan called the 47 plan. They

37
00:03:47,745 --> 00:03:51,685
Speaker 6:  are an MVNO. They're just kind of piggybacking on T-Mobile coverage. But

38
00:03:51,685 --> 00:03:54,045
Speaker 6:  that's just this kind of single plan you can get. You could bring any phone

39
00:03:54,045 --> 00:03:57,805
Speaker 6:  you want to Trump mobile if for some reason you wanted to and, and

40
00:03:57,805 --> 00:04:01,205
Speaker 6:  sign up. In theory, you can do that right now and switch to Trump mobile.

41
00:04:01,445 --> 00:04:05,085
Speaker 6:  I, I think in practice that might not work entirely smoothly, but

42
00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:08,965
Speaker 6:  supposedly you could. But then they also wanted to have a phone because,

43
00:04:09,145 --> 00:04:12,965
Speaker 6:  you know, you can't have Trump mobile without the Trump mobile. And that

44
00:04:12,965 --> 00:04:16,925
Speaker 6:  is the, the T one phone 8,002. This I feel

45
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:20,725
Speaker 6:  like we know less about in that we know a lot of things about it, but

46
00:04:20,735 --> 00:04:24,405
Speaker 6:  don't believe very many of them. We have a big long spec sheet. We

47
00:04:24,675 --> 00:04:28,445
Speaker 6:  kind of have a picture, but I'm pretty sure it's not actually a picture of

48
00:04:28,445 --> 00:04:32,245
Speaker 6:  a real phone in the world. And this is a

49
00:04:32,245 --> 00:04:36,045
Speaker 6:  phone they claim will be made in America or is being

50
00:04:36,045 --> 00:04:39,165
Speaker 6:  made in America, or will eventually be made in America. Some combination

51
00:04:39,165 --> 00:04:43,045
Speaker 6:  of the above. And it's coming out either in August or

52
00:04:43,045 --> 00:04:46,485
Speaker 6:  in September, depending on which part of their website you believe. Yeah,

53
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:50,085
Speaker 4:  We should say Dom, you're not like making

54
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:53,325
Speaker 4:  different guesses here about possibilities. These are all things that people

55
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:57,125
Speaker 4:  associated with this project have said out loud in public. Like

56
00:04:57,585 --> 00:05:01,125
Speaker 4:  it either will or won't or might be someday built in the United States is

57
00:05:01,165 --> 00:05:04,605
Speaker 4:  a compilation of things that Eric Trump said. Like that's just

58
00:05:04,945 --> 00:05:07,885
Speaker 4:  the, these are not educated guesses. That is what, that is what the person

59
00:05:07,885 --> 00:05:11,325
Speaker 4:  responsible for. This has said out loud over and over and over again.

60
00:05:11,635 --> 00:05:13,125
Speaker 4:  This is what we're doing here. This is

61
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,365
Speaker 6:  All we have to work with. Yeah.

62
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:18,485
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So I think, I think I like the way you set that up because like the

63
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:22,235
Speaker 4:  Trump mobile piece of it is just whatever,

64
00:05:22,245 --> 00:05:26,195
Speaker 4:  right? Like Jake, you, you wrote about sort of the, the economics of Trump

65
00:05:26,195 --> 00:05:29,715
Speaker 4:  mobile, but basically an NVO is not a complicated

66
00:05:29,845 --> 00:05:33,755
Speaker 4:  thing to do. You can just have a wireless carrier if you

67
00:05:33,755 --> 00:05:34,835
Speaker 4:  want, have a wireless carrier.

68
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:38,635
Speaker 5:  I mean, this is also such a funny week to have launched it because like less

69
00:05:38,635 --> 00:05:41,875
Speaker 5:  than a week before this, the Smartlist Podcast

70
00:05:42,755 --> 00:05:46,595
Speaker 5:  launched a mobile carrier and like, if, if Smartlist

71
00:05:46,615 --> 00:05:50,475
Speaker 5:  can launch a wireless carrier, then first off stay tuned for wireless.

72
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:54,435
Speaker 5:  It's probably not happening, but it could, it could is the point. I will

73
00:05:54,435 --> 00:05:58,405
Speaker 4:  Say, Mila is not here today. He's off doing fancy people things. I

74
00:05:58,435 --> 00:06:02,005
Speaker 4:  pitched him on the idea of VERGE Mobile as an

75
00:06:02,205 --> 00:06:05,605
Speaker 4:  MVNO and he immediately green lit it, and I'm saying it in public now so

76
00:06:05,605 --> 00:06:07,325
Speaker 4:  that he can't take it back. This

77
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,445
Speaker 5:  Is happening. This, this is how he goes head to head with Brendan Carr. You

78
00:06:10,445 --> 00:06:12,045
Speaker 5:  know who, who regulates VERGE Mobile.

79
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:13,405
Speaker 4:  Yeah,

80
00:06:13,405 --> 00:06:17,245
Speaker 5:  We're coming through, this is how we make it happen. But yeah, look like

81
00:06:18,115 --> 00:06:21,645
Speaker 5:  Allison Johnson talked to a couple of analysts about, you know, why are

82
00:06:21,935 --> 00:06:24,925
Speaker 5:  MVNOs like blowing up right now? And apparently it's, it's part of it is

83
00:06:25,395 --> 00:06:29,165
Speaker 5:  five GII, I hate to say it, but I, there's just a bunch of

84
00:06:29,215 --> 00:06:33,165
Speaker 5:  extra spectrum and bandwidth and capacity because of 5G. So

85
00:06:33,165 --> 00:06:36,045
Speaker 5:  there, so these networks are like, how do we offload this?

86
00:06:36,785 --> 00:06:40,725
Speaker 5:  Number two, eims make it really easy to just join whatever network

87
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:44,245
Speaker 5:  you want and try them out. And then I think everybody's looking at

88
00:06:44,245 --> 00:06:48,005
Speaker 5:  Ryan Reynolds who let, let's be clear what Ryan Reynolds did. He

89
00:06:48,155 --> 00:06:51,765
Speaker 5:  sold T-Mobile's own network back to T-Mobile

90
00:06:52,065 --> 00:06:55,605
Speaker 5:  for over a billion dollars, which good for him. That rules

91
00:06:56,025 --> 00:06:59,525
Speaker 4:  One of the great business cos of the century, honestly.

92
00:07:00,025 --> 00:07:03,805
Speaker 4:  And, and it, it's actually like a perfect microcosm of the whole thing. And

93
00:07:03,885 --> 00:07:06,245
Speaker 4:  I think Allison's gonna come on the show on Tuesday and we're, we're gonna

94
00:07:06,245 --> 00:07:09,965
Speaker 4:  sort of dive deeper into the world of MVNOs, but Mint Mobile,

95
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:14,005
Speaker 4:  which was an MVNO, like you're talking about, perfect example of this, right?

96
00:07:14,005 --> 00:07:17,805
Speaker 4:  Because all it is is you take Spectrum that exists from one of these

97
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:21,765
Speaker 4:  carriers. They give you capacity on their network, you then

98
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:25,205
Speaker 4:  build whatever brand you want to around it. And all you have to do is manage

99
00:07:25,205 --> 00:07:28,325
Speaker 4:  like billing and customer service, right? Like the, the network piece of

100
00:07:28,325 --> 00:07:32,125
Speaker 4:  it. It, it's kind of like standing up a company on AWS right? Like the,

101
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:35,605
Speaker 4:  the networking is no longer the problem. You just sort of solve everything

102
00:07:35,605 --> 00:07:39,525
Speaker 4:  else around it. And that is all stuff you can increasingly like

103
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:43,445
Speaker 4:  offload to a bunch of other SaaS things. So you just, like, you sign up for

104
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:47,445
Speaker 4:  six pieces of enterprise software and like you have an MVNO and

105
00:07:47,445 --> 00:07:51,325
Speaker 4:  you can just do it. And so it's becoming like a branding exercise

106
00:07:51,385 --> 00:07:54,525
Speaker 4:  now. And I think Allison compared it to like the, the liquor

107
00:07:55,485 --> 00:07:58,365
Speaker 4:  companies that used to just put, you know, George Clooney's name on a bottle

108
00:07:58,365 --> 00:08:02,005
Speaker 4:  of liquor and call it a day. Now you can do it with a wireless carrier.

109
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:05,445
Speaker 5:  I mean that's what it is, right? It's it's a branding exercise, which is

110
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:08,725
Speaker 5:  like, that is what the Trump organization is. They just put their name on

111
00:08:08,725 --> 00:08:10,005
Speaker 5:  things. It's Trump stakes.

112
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:13,685
Speaker 4:  Yes, I agree. And I think in a weird way, I actually think with Trump this

113
00:08:13,685 --> 00:08:16,965
Speaker 4:  makes more sense than with some other things. Yes. But like it's weirdly

114
00:08:16,965 --> 00:08:20,085
Speaker 4:  it's the smartless one that I have not been able to get my brain around.

115
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:23,445
Speaker 4:  Like what is there, is there any

116
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:27,205
Speaker 4:  celebrity or brand in the world that would make either of you immediately

117
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:30,885
Speaker 4:  switch wireless carriers to be on that mobile carrier Dom? Like who,

118
00:08:31,025 --> 00:08:32,325
Speaker 4:  who, who would do it for you?

119
00:08:32,785 --> 00:08:36,005
Speaker 6:  The only name that is for some reason immediately coming into my mind is

120
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:39,725
Speaker 6:  Kyle McLachlan of, of of Twin Peaks and so on.

121
00:08:39,835 --> 00:08:40,125
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

122
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,485
Speaker 4:  That's it. Twin Peaks mobile. You're in.

123
00:08:41,905 --> 00:08:45,805
Speaker 6:  I'm, I'm in. Yeah. And in loving memory of David Lynch, let's launch a

124
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:47,845
Speaker 6:  mobile network and, and we'll go from there.

125
00:08:48,315 --> 00:08:52,165
Speaker 4:  Twin Peaks also ironically have pretty good name for a wireless game. Yeah.

126
00:08:53,395 --> 00:08:55,005
Speaker 4:  Jake, what about you? Who would, who would it be for you?

127
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,005
Speaker 5:  You, oh, we're going with, with the Rock Wireless, right? This

128
00:08:59,195 --> 00:08:59,685
Speaker 5:  between

129
00:08:59,685 --> 00:08:59,925
Speaker 4:  The Rock

130
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:03,365
Speaker 5:  Wireless, like it's gonna be an every single movie contract that he has to

131
00:09:03,365 --> 00:09:06,445
Speaker 5:  be like, hello, I'm speaking you, you from Rock, rock Wireless.

132
00:09:06,945 --> 00:09:08,365
Speaker 4:  Can you hear me now? Yes. Terrific.

133
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:08,965
Speaker 5:  Of course you can.

134
00:09:09,545 --> 00:09:10,325
Speaker 4:  Of course you can.

135
00:09:10,435 --> 00:09:13,525
Speaker 5:  With the best connection across the 50 states.

136
00:09:14,985 --> 00:09:15,405
Speaker 4:  See that's

137
00:09:15,405 --> 00:09:16,765
Speaker 5:  Very good free international calling. Yeah.

138
00:09:17,145 --> 00:09:20,565
Speaker 4:  The thing that's really upsetting is that would 100% Oh it would crush. He

139
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:21,885
Speaker 4:  would do it and it would work.

140
00:09:22,835 --> 00:09:25,165
Speaker 5:  Like you need somebody who can sell it.

141
00:09:25,545 --> 00:09:28,845
Speaker 4:  Yes. This is very good. But wait, I, we will come back to the MV and O stuff.

142
00:09:28,925 --> 00:09:32,085
Speaker 4:  'cause I think like we're talking about, that's actually the more straightforward

143
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:35,325
Speaker 4:  part of this. And Jake, you mentioned Trump stakes, like this is just, it's

144
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:38,325
Speaker 4:  just Trump stakes. Like it really is just a pure

145
00:09:39,015 --> 00:09:42,605
Speaker 4:  brand licensing exercise. And fine, if you wanna overpay

146
00:09:43,025 --> 00:09:46,835
Speaker 4:  to say that you have Trump Mobile, knock yourself out. The service will be

147
00:09:46,835 --> 00:09:50,435
Speaker 4:  fine. It's too expensive. It's $47 and 45 cents because he was the

148
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:52,075
Speaker 4:  45th and 47th president.

149
00:09:53,895 --> 00:09:56,675
Speaker 4:  My favorite part of that, by the way, is it would've made way more chronological

150
00:09:56,675 --> 00:10:00,515
Speaker 4:  sense if it was $45 and 47 cents and they did it backwards just to scam

151
00:10:00,515 --> 00:10:01,755
Speaker 4:  you out of more money. Yes.

152
00:10:02,415 --> 00:10:03,115
Speaker 5:  You know, that's true.

153
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:06,315
Speaker 4:  Hate that. But we should talk about the phone.

154
00:10:07,285 --> 00:10:11,065
Speaker 4:  And one of the amazing VERGE things that

155
00:10:11,225 --> 00:10:14,825
Speaker 4:  happened to this week, which doesn't happen a lot, but is one of my favorite

156
00:10:14,825 --> 00:10:18,785
Speaker 4:  things that happens is a, a piece of news drops and like

157
00:10:18,865 --> 00:10:22,625
Speaker 4:  a huge percentage of VERGE employees all

158
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:26,505
Speaker 4:  begin the same quest at the same time. And this time it was,

159
00:10:26,735 --> 00:10:30,465
Speaker 4:  what the hell is that phone? Because we all made the same

160
00:10:30,465 --> 00:10:33,785
Speaker 4:  assumption and, and Dom you got to do this before anybody, which was, we

161
00:10:33,785 --> 00:10:37,145
Speaker 4:  saw the Photoshop of this phone on the website

162
00:10:37,645 --> 00:10:40,825
Speaker 4:  and we all sort of immediately assumed, okay, it's like a, it's a re badged

163
00:10:40,895 --> 00:10:44,865
Speaker 4:  something. And then the Internet's favorite question for several days has

164
00:10:44,865 --> 00:10:48,545
Speaker 4:  been, what is that something Dom,

165
00:10:48,685 --> 00:10:52,025
Speaker 4:  you see more weird phones than Jake And I do. By virtue of not being in the

166
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:54,745
Speaker 4:  United States, how has, how has this exploration gone for you?

167
00:10:55,335 --> 00:10:58,665
Speaker 6:  More challenging than I expected. I think though, the strangest thing about

168
00:10:58,665 --> 00:11:01,985
Speaker 6:  this was, I did think the moment this dropped, I thought, I can find out

169
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:05,865
Speaker 6:  what this is. I can absolutely go track down what phone this is. I,

170
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,465
Speaker 6:  you know, it was like rolling through my head all the names of the brands

171
00:11:08,465 --> 00:11:11,505
Speaker 6:  that I know work as ODMs and that and that, that do these off the shelf things.

172
00:11:11,685 --> 00:11:15,305
Speaker 6:  That's like I can find a phone that has been re reskinned. The weird thing

173
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:18,625
Speaker 6:  is we can't, we can find a lot of phones that are very similar,

174
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:23,065
Speaker 6:  a lot of phones that match everything on the spec list except

175
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:27,145
Speaker 6:  one bit. So it doesn't look like this

176
00:11:27,165 --> 00:11:31,105
Speaker 6:  is an exact version of another phone on the market that's just been given

177
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:35,145
Speaker 6:  like a gold spray paint and a, and a, you know, us flag on the back.

178
00:11:36,025 --> 00:11:39,345
Speaker 6:  Whatever they've done, you know, they are working with, well to whatever

179
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:43,145
Speaker 6:  extent, you know, this is real, they are working with some sort of ODM

180
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:47,145
Speaker 6:  in, in most likely in China to customize something a bit to make this

181
00:11:47,145 --> 00:11:50,545
Speaker 6:  from what we can tell. Because if there is an exact version of this phone

182
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:52,265
Speaker 6:  out there, we, we can't find it. So far

183
00:11:52,485 --> 00:11:56,045
Speaker 4:  What's the closest you've found? Like if you, if you had to pick one, where

184
00:11:56,045 --> 00:11:56,445
Speaker 4:  do you land?

185
00:11:56,825 --> 00:12:00,605
Speaker 6:  Oh, I think some of the, I've never actually known how you're meant to say

186
00:12:00,605 --> 00:12:04,565
Speaker 6:  it, but ePhone is always what I've gone for. I think some of

187
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:08,445
Speaker 6:  the ePhone models look very, very close. They have that perfect

188
00:12:09,825 --> 00:12:13,285
Speaker 6:  iPhone pro knockoff triangular camera module

189
00:12:14,145 --> 00:12:17,685
Speaker 6:  and they do have some models in, in basically the same size and, and with

190
00:12:17,685 --> 00:12:21,325
Speaker 6:  a headphone jack, which is that weird element that narrows everything down

191
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:25,125
Speaker 6:  a lot, including a 3.5 mil headphone Jack actually suddenly removes a lot

192
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:28,405
Speaker 6:  of the phones that this could be because that's obviously a part of the chassis

193
00:12:28,405 --> 00:12:32,005
Speaker 6:  and part of the design that I I imagine is baked in fairly early in the design

194
00:12:32,005 --> 00:12:34,325
Speaker 6:  of these things. So I I I can't say that with total confidence.

195
00:12:34,385 --> 00:12:37,805
Speaker 5:  Oh, that's interesting because I, I think, and David you pointed this out

196
00:12:37,805 --> 00:12:41,725
Speaker 5:  on the site, but the, the things that is most incongruous here is

197
00:12:41,725 --> 00:12:45,685
Speaker 5:  they say it runs Android 15, which is not true of, of a,

198
00:12:45,785 --> 00:12:49,645
Speaker 5:  you know, a cheapo knockoff Android phone and that it has a headphone jack,

199
00:12:49,775 --> 00:12:52,445
Speaker 5:  which is true of a very old

200
00:12:53,425 --> 00:12:57,245
Speaker 5:  cheapo Android phone. And So I like, I also have been poking around

201
00:12:57,385 --> 00:13:01,205
Speaker 5:  Dom and you can find a bunch of iPhone lookalikes on Ali

202
00:13:01,205 --> 00:13:05,005
Speaker 5:  Express and the headphone jack is the thing that I think is particularly

203
00:13:05,005 --> 00:13:05,725
Speaker 5:  hard to come by.

204
00:13:05,915 --> 00:13:09,845
Speaker 4:  Jake, you sent me a screenshot when you say poking around you I believe went

205
00:13:09,845 --> 00:13:13,485
Speaker 4:  to Amazon and Googled big Android phone and that was the great

206
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:15,285
Speaker 4:  journalism that Jake did mobile. I thought that was

207
00:13:16,025 --> 00:13:18,685
Speaker 5:  Was about the right starting point. And I have now, lemme tell you, it was

208
00:13:18,685 --> 00:13:22,405
Speaker 5:  so successful. I have repeated that everywhere you just type in big Android

209
00:13:22,405 --> 00:13:26,365
Speaker 5:  phone and it gets you exactly what you want. 'cause it turns out that

210
00:13:26,365 --> 00:13:30,085
Speaker 5:  people actually just want a thing that looks like an iPhone and you know

211
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:34,005
Speaker 5:  what? That, that search result gets you there. I do think like what we have

212
00:13:34,005 --> 00:13:35,125
Speaker 5:  been finding is telling

213
00:13:36,695 --> 00:13:40,045
Speaker 5:  these things cost what dom like $150.

214
00:13:41,235 --> 00:13:45,205
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I mean one of the closer comparisons, like actually

215
00:13:45,205 --> 00:13:48,725
Speaker 6:  a phone that did get a real release in the us well almost did it got recalled,

216
00:13:49,085 --> 00:13:52,725
Speaker 6:  but the, the T-Mobile Revel seven Pro 5G

217
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:56,245
Speaker 6:  is a pretty close match. I think the camera layout is wrong. It, it's not

218
00:13:56,245 --> 00:13:59,805
Speaker 6:  the exact same thing, but that did, you know, have a proper price announced

219
00:13:59,825 --> 00:14:03,605
Speaker 6:  by a major American company and that was $250 and it is a

220
00:14:03,605 --> 00:14:07,365
Speaker 6:  very close spec match for this. If you go for ones direct from the likes

221
00:14:07,365 --> 00:14:11,045
Speaker 6:  of ePhone or, or Doogie or OMI Digi,

222
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:14,685
Speaker 6:  then yeah, maybe you're more in the 200, 1 50 range.

223
00:14:15,275 --> 00:14:19,205
Speaker 4:  True kudos for saying all of those names with a straight face. The, the most

224
00:14:19,205 --> 00:14:23,005
Speaker 4:  enlightening thing about this whole process to me has been how

225
00:14:23,255 --> 00:14:26,765
Speaker 4:  truly deep the like Amazon alphabet soup

226
00:14:27,145 --> 00:14:30,685
Speaker 4:  of phone brands goes. I mean it's wild

227
00:14:30,945 --> 00:14:34,685
Speaker 4:  and every imaginable variation of

228
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:38,125
Speaker 4:  specs you can just, you can just have, and it's, this is like a thing I like

229
00:14:38,515 --> 00:14:42,445
Speaker 4:  intuitively sort of new, right? That like intellectually I understand

230
00:14:42,445 --> 00:14:46,325
Speaker 4:  that phones are mass manufactured unlike almost anything

231
00:14:46,325 --> 00:14:49,205
Speaker 4:  we've ever seen. And they're everywhere and you can have any kind of spec

232
00:14:49,205 --> 00:14:51,240
Speaker 4:  that you want and they're just pulling parts out of a bin and, and putting

233
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,245
Speaker 4:  them together and sending you the phone. But oh my God, can you just have

234
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:57,965
Speaker 4:  whatever phone you want on Alibaba tomorrow? And like Jake you said

235
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:01,485
Speaker 4:  98% of them will look alarmingly like an iPhone.

236
00:15:02,115 --> 00:15:06,085
Speaker 4:  It's just nuts. How many of these are out there and they're so cheap. Hmm.

237
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:09,805
Speaker 4:  Like a bunch of the specs, right? It was like a 5,000 million battery, 12

238
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,725
Speaker 4:  gigs of ram, I think 256 gigs of storage.

239
00:15:14,505 --> 00:15:17,565
Speaker 4:  All this like relatively fine

240
00:15:18,195 --> 00:15:21,805
Speaker 4:  Android specs, right? Like slightly better than the pixel nine. A way to

241
00:15:21,805 --> 00:15:22,165
Speaker 4:  go Google

242
00:15:24,095 --> 00:15:27,815
Speaker 4:  120 bucks in many cases. Like you, I'm gonna,

243
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:31,335
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna start buying phones just for fun. Like I, I need to own more phones

244
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:33,255
Speaker 4:  is the thing that I have learned at the end of this process.

245
00:15:33,755 --> 00:15:37,135
Speaker 5:  Dom, how much have you gotten a chance to try some of these like random cheapo

246
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:40,615
Speaker 5:  phones? Because again, like the specs, are they, they sound delightful and

247
00:15:40,615 --> 00:15:43,855
Speaker 5:  then in practice I get the impression that they do not perform like what

248
00:15:43,855 --> 00:15:45,215
Speaker 5:  you would expect from those numbers.

249
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:49,415
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it can be a mixed bag. I've tried a few, especially the

250
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,455
Speaker 6:  ruggedized ones.

251
00:15:52,005 --> 00:15:55,855
Speaker 6:  They, they tend to, I think performance is usually okay in

252
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:59,455
Speaker 6:  terms of them being reasonably fast to use depending on what chip set you're

253
00:15:59,455 --> 00:16:01,215
Speaker 6:  gonna find in there. But you know, once you've got the chip set and the ram

254
00:16:01,215 --> 00:16:04,855
Speaker 6:  that's pretty much baked in, the software will probably be ropey

255
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,935
Speaker 6:  the closer it is to being stock Android, the better a time you're likely

256
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:11,055
Speaker 6:  to have, the more they've bothered to put some spin on it. The worse of a

257
00:16:11,055 --> 00:16:14,335
Speaker 6:  time you're gonna have, you will probably be lucky to get

258
00:16:14,835 --> 00:16:18,735
Speaker 6:  an OS upgrade, you know, or a

259
00:16:18,735 --> 00:16:22,535
Speaker 6:  couple of security patches. I I would never trust these things for any sort

260
00:16:22,535 --> 00:16:25,295
Speaker 6:  of long-term use that kind of, almost like disposable phones.

261
00:16:26,395 --> 00:16:29,055
Speaker 6:  The big thing you're not gonna get is camera performance. None of them have

262
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:31,975
Speaker 6:  cameras worth of Damn at all. And that was the giveaway for me looking at,

263
00:16:31,975 --> 00:16:35,295
Speaker 6:  at the T one is going through and being like, yeah, a lot of these specs

264
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:38,975
Speaker 6:  sound fine. It's 120 hertz OLA display, it's got a decent sized

265
00:16:38,975 --> 00:16:42,655
Speaker 6:  battery, 12 gigs of ram is more generous than a lot of these funds would

266
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:46,255
Speaker 6:  ship with. Yeah. But then you get to that camera and it's a 50 megapixel

267
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:50,175
Speaker 6:  main camera with two megapixel depth and macro sensors. No information

268
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,895
Speaker 6:  about what those sensors in any of this are. So that 50 megapixel is probably

269
00:16:54,095 --> 00:16:57,895
Speaker 6:  absolutely dreadful. There's gonna be no software

270
00:16:57,895 --> 00:17:00,215
Speaker 6:  doing its own camera processing functionally, you know, it's, it's gonna

271
00:17:00,215 --> 00:17:03,775
Speaker 6:  be doing very little to improve the image you get. Those macro and depth

272
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:07,615
Speaker 6:  sensor are just dead space. The, the cheap end of the Android market has

273
00:17:07,615 --> 00:17:10,175
Speaker 6:  been throwing them on phones for years as a way to goose up camera counts.

274
00:17:10,485 --> 00:17:12,855
Speaker 6:  It's a three camera phone. Interesting. It looks like an iPhone with three

275
00:17:12,855 --> 00:17:16,055
Speaker 6:  cameras, you know, at a glance that's a triple camera. You open the camera

276
00:17:16,195 --> 00:17:19,975
Speaker 6:  app up, there's only one camera mode to use. There's no ultra wide, there's

277
00:17:19,975 --> 00:17:23,895
Speaker 6:  no zoom. You just have the camera. The macro in depth sensor might kick

278
00:17:23,895 --> 00:17:27,735
Speaker 6:  in at certain points. They might just not, and if they do,

279
00:17:27,735 --> 00:17:29,175
Speaker 6:  they're not gonna do anything you care about.

280
00:17:29,605 --> 00:17:33,455
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Two megapixel macro sensor is not an exciting piece

281
00:17:33,455 --> 00:17:37,135
Speaker 4:  of camera hardware, I would say. No. Yeah. I I'm so struck by

282
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:41,775
Speaker 4:  like how many of the sort of specs

283
00:17:41,775 --> 00:17:44,775
Speaker 4:  that we have thought of as important for a long time and like we talk about

284
00:17:44,775 --> 00:17:48,655
Speaker 4:  them in reviews are actually like, not not just table

285
00:17:48,655 --> 00:17:52,005
Speaker 4:  stakes but almost kind of irrelevant to a lot of this stuff now. Like

286
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:56,725
Speaker 4:  you, you should be worried about a phone that ships with less than this

287
00:17:56,725 --> 00:18:00,205
Speaker 4:  amount of storage, right? And like yeah, any, anything below a certain number

288
00:18:00,305 --> 00:18:03,325
Speaker 4:  you should take as like a huge red flag. Everything else is like, that's,

289
00:18:03,355 --> 00:18:07,245
Speaker 4:  it's just, it's just a phone. You just made a phone. And I think we've

290
00:18:07,245 --> 00:18:10,165
Speaker 4:  come to an interesting space where I remember, like, I wrote this big story

291
00:18:10,245 --> 00:18:13,285
Speaker 4:  a bunch of years ago about this company Blue Products, which is a, a Miami

292
00:18:13,495 --> 00:18:17,245
Speaker 4:  based, they're essentially an importer of phones,

293
00:18:17,345 --> 00:18:20,645
Speaker 4:  but they were very early to this game of like essentially drop shipping phones

294
00:18:20,645 --> 00:18:24,285
Speaker 4:  on Amazon and would would bring them in and tweak them a little bit. And

295
00:18:24,285 --> 00:18:27,725
Speaker 4:  they started to do more and more over time. But they had like real honest

296
00:18:27,725 --> 00:18:31,045
Speaker 4:  to god performance issues because they were, they were not using

297
00:18:31,755 --> 00:18:35,565
Speaker 4:  mid-range specs. And this is like in 2012 when mid-range specs were

298
00:18:35,565 --> 00:18:39,445
Speaker 4:  sort of a problem. Now you can get probably,

299
00:18:39,465 --> 00:18:43,445
Speaker 4:  we don't know what processor this T one phone has, which is a very notable

300
00:18:43,685 --> 00:18:47,525
Speaker 4:  emission, but assuming it's like a middle of the road processor, you can

301
00:18:47,525 --> 00:18:51,325
Speaker 4:  sort of brute force into reasonable performance

302
00:18:51,345 --> 00:18:54,365
Speaker 4:  on Android, right? Like most things work

303
00:18:55,115 --> 00:18:58,685
Speaker 4:  fine because there is just enough performance headroom in even like a half

304
00:18:58,685 --> 00:19:02,485
Speaker 4:  decent processor that I think the, the like overall quality of a

305
00:19:02,485 --> 00:19:05,205
Speaker 4:  crappy phone has gone way up over time.

306
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:07,365
Speaker 4:  Which is fascinating

307
00:19:07,465 --> 00:19:10,765
Speaker 6:  To get a phone that actively feels slow and laggy

308
00:19:11,265 --> 00:19:14,165
Speaker 6:  in that day-to-day usage. You know, I'm not gonna talk about gaming performance,

309
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:16,405
Speaker 6:  that's a different thing. But if you want something that really feels like

310
00:19:16,435 --> 00:19:19,565
Speaker 6:  slow and you open Instagram up, you would have to go below a hundred dollars

311
00:19:19,845 --> 00:19:23,645
Speaker 6:  I think to find something that's still in, in feels slow like that. Anything

312
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:26,485
Speaker 6:  above a hundred bucks and it's gonna feel fine just for social media and

313
00:19:26,485 --> 00:19:28,805
Speaker 6:  email and, and your average app,

314
00:19:29,295 --> 00:19:32,805
Speaker 4:  Right? Unless you decide to just

315
00:19:33,165 --> 00:19:36,045
Speaker 4:  absolutely ruin the phone with bloatware and spyware and all kinds of stuff.

316
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:40,245
Speaker 4:  And if I'm being completely honest with you, I think the

317
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:44,205
Speaker 4:  Trump organization might do that. Like I just, can you

318
00:19:44,205 --> 00:19:48,045
Speaker 4:  imagine the, the like windows style

319
00:19:48,715 --> 00:19:51,725
Speaker 4:  crap that's gonna get built into this and it's, it's gonna come with like

320
00:19:51,805 --> 00:19:55,605
Speaker 4:  a hundred apps, none of which you want. Most of which you've never heard

321
00:19:55,605 --> 00:19:59,485
Speaker 4:  of, all of which are like allowed to run in the background and cause all

322
00:19:59,485 --> 00:20:03,365
Speaker 4:  kinds of problems for like I think we've been on a good path away

323
00:20:03,675 --> 00:20:07,365
Speaker 4:  from junkie software coming on phones for a very long time. Even Samsung,

324
00:20:07,455 --> 00:20:11,365
Speaker 4:  which can barely help itself has kind of learned how to help itself and here

325
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,365
Speaker 4:  comes Trump mobile and they're just like, what if we just bundled every app

326
00:20:14,365 --> 00:20:18,125
Speaker 4:  that would give us a dollar onto your phone? Would that be fun? Would you

327
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:18,365
Speaker 4:  like that?

328
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,565
Speaker 6:  I'm fascinated to see where they land here because

329
00:20:22,205 --> 00:20:24,725
Speaker 6:  I still review a lot of Chinese phones and, and all of Chinese flagships

330
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:27,285
Speaker 6:  and you know, phones that don't launch in the US but would be in the like

331
00:20:27,285 --> 00:20:30,765
Speaker 6:  grand and a half price range if they did. And

332
00:20:31,465 --> 00:20:35,445
Speaker 6:  you can turn those on and they are filled with apps from minute

333
00:20:35,745 --> 00:20:39,725
Speaker 6:  one and not, not opera apps, not Xmi apps. They have

334
00:20:39,725 --> 00:20:43,245
Speaker 6:  every social media network come to the sun, every Chinese food delivery app,

335
00:20:44,455 --> 00:20:47,525
Speaker 6:  every different browser and search engine, all this stuff. There's so much

336
00:20:47,525 --> 00:20:50,605
Speaker 6:  stuff loaded on even a very high-end device in China that is still the way

337
00:20:50,605 --> 00:20:51,325
Speaker 6:  that market operates.

338
00:20:51,325 --> 00:20:51,925
Speaker 4:  That's so interesting.

339
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:55,405
Speaker 6:  And you're right, like in in the west, like the funds we that you can buy

340
00:20:55,405 --> 00:20:58,245
Speaker 6:  in in Europe and, and the states like that just doesn't happen anymore.

341
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:02,845
Speaker 6:  But it is still a money spinner if you're willing to make that compromise

342
00:21:03,065 --> 00:21:06,725
Speaker 6:  and Yeah, I I really bet the Trump organization is willing to make that

343
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:07,205
Speaker 6:  compromise.

344
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,445
Speaker 4:  I know I've been trying to decide like what what apps do I think are gonna

345
00:21:10,445 --> 00:21:13,925
Speaker 4:  get built in. I think the the funniest one that I've been able to come up

346
00:21:13,925 --> 00:21:17,685
Speaker 4:  with is signal. Like, I think Signal should reach out to the Trump organization

347
00:21:17,705 --> 00:21:21,405
Speaker 4:  and be like, just, just build us into the T one. We'll we'll we'll give you

348
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,925
Speaker 4:  some money just for a bit. I think I would enjoy that very much,

349
00:21:26,605 --> 00:21:30,505
Speaker 4:  but I suspect that will not be it and it will be much uglier. So Jake,

350
00:21:30,565 --> 00:21:33,665
Speaker 4:  here's my question. Is there any chance any of this is real, like

351
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:38,405
Speaker 4:  the the $500 T one phone launching on Trump mobile in

352
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:42,535
Speaker 4:  September? Is there any chance that's a real thing that's gonna

353
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:42,735
Speaker 4:  happen

354
00:21:43,325 --> 00:21:47,135
Speaker 5:  Made in the US No. I I think like can they have a

355
00:21:47,135 --> 00:21:51,015
Speaker 5:  phone available to send us by September? Yeah. Why not? Like I think we

356
00:21:51,015 --> 00:21:53,935
Speaker 5:  could get a phone available to, to send to people by September.

357
00:21:54,645 --> 00:21:58,255
Speaker 4:  Yeah. One Alibaba order away from having a bunch of phones that we Right.

358
00:21:58,835 --> 00:22:02,695
Speaker 5:  And like, you know, like if you look at the Trump

359
00:22:02,695 --> 00:22:06,615
Speaker 5:  mobile website, like it does not look like

360
00:22:06,695 --> 00:22:10,495
Speaker 5:  a thing. They put a lot of effort into it. It it like right,

361
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,855
Speaker 5:  this looks like it was, it was put together in about a day. And

362
00:22:14,435 --> 00:22:18,175
Speaker 5:  So I I'm not expecting this phone to be particularly great. I'm not

363
00:22:18,175 --> 00:22:21,335
Speaker 5:  expecting 'em to put a ton of work into making this

364
00:22:22,735 --> 00:22:26,375
Speaker 5:  wireless service all that exciting and appealing. I

365
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:29,975
Speaker 5:  suspect they will get a phone out the door. Surely they have the

366
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:34,175
Speaker 5:  resources to put in an ALI Express order. I I I think that is

367
00:22:34,175 --> 00:22:38,135
Speaker 5:  manageable on that one podcast we saw

368
00:22:38,295 --> 00:22:41,975
Speaker 5:  E Eric Trump holding up two versions of what like

369
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,975
Speaker 5:  supposedly was the, the T one phone

370
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:47,295
Speaker 5:  8,002. He

371
00:22:47,295 --> 00:22:50,735
Speaker 4:  Didn't say it was the T one phone, but he sure wanted you to think that it

372
00:22:50,735 --> 00:22:51,575
Speaker 4:  was the T one phone

373
00:22:51,685 --> 00:22:55,215
Speaker 5:  They keep showing. Here's the thing, there are two versions of this phone

374
00:22:55,215 --> 00:22:59,135
Speaker 5:  that we have seen. There's the one on the website, which is just an egregiously

375
00:22:59,195 --> 00:23:02,975
Speaker 5:  bad Photoshop. And then they keep having the, there's the ones that, that

376
00:23:03,045 --> 00:23:06,175
Speaker 5:  Eric has held up as well as the ones that they've posted on social media,

377
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:10,455
Speaker 5:  which are either just iPhones with stamps on the back

378
00:23:11,635 --> 00:23:15,415
Speaker 5:  Or they are, you know, the first versions of what they've imported from

379
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:19,335
Speaker 5:  from China. I, and seriously I've been like pixel

380
00:23:19,335 --> 00:23:22,815
Speaker 5:  peeping on these things. They have the antenna lines in the same spots as

381
00:23:22,815 --> 00:23:26,655
Speaker 5:  an iPhone. They have the buttons in the same spots as the iPhone. The

382
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,575
Speaker 5:  one thing that I have seen is that

383
00:23:30,245 --> 00:23:34,175
Speaker 5:  iPhones are, are really the only phones that have the volume buttons on the

384
00:23:34,495 --> 00:23:38,255
Speaker 5:  left hand side. And that's kind true. I I could be wrong, but

385
00:23:38,275 --> 00:23:41,535
Speaker 5:  all all of the, the Android knockoffs I've seen,

386
00:23:42,685 --> 00:23:45,860
Speaker 5:  even they, the ones that are trying to be exactly like an iPhone have the,

387
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,605
Speaker 5:  the volume buttons on the right and these ones. So I don't know, I I'm not

388
00:23:49,605 --> 00:23:53,565
Speaker 5:  sure if that's actually the key one that he's holding up, but you know,

389
00:23:53,575 --> 00:23:56,645
Speaker 5:  maybe they'll just wave around some more iPhones. I listen, I think they're

390
00:23:56,725 --> 00:24:00,325
Speaker 5:  probably gonna ship something. Do I think this phone is going to

391
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:03,725
Speaker 5:  revolutionize the phone industry? No. Do I think this phone is going to convince

392
00:24:05,245 --> 00:24:08,725
Speaker 5:  Americans and Congress that you can in fact

393
00:24:09,135 --> 00:24:13,045
Speaker 5:  build great phones in the United States? I do not think so

394
00:24:13,045 --> 00:24:15,685
Speaker 5:  particularly 'cause I do not think this is going to be built in the United States.

395
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:18,965
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I would agree with all of that. The, the Trump organization has said

396
00:24:19,065 --> 00:24:22,965
Speaker 4:  to a couple of folks that their plan is to build

397
00:24:22,965 --> 00:24:26,925
Speaker 4:  it in Alabama, California and Florida. Make of that

398
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:30,285
Speaker 4:  what you will, and again, we we should say there, there is a

399
00:24:30,365 --> 00:24:31,765
Speaker 4:  technicality by which

400
00:24:33,365 --> 00:24:37,305
Speaker 4:  you can get away with something like this, right? Like the, the rules for

401
00:24:37,855 --> 00:24:41,825
Speaker 4:  what it requires to be able to say something was made in x, y,

402
00:24:41,905 --> 00:24:45,785
Speaker 4:  Z place are not as straightforward as you would like

403
00:24:45,785 --> 00:24:49,745
Speaker 4:  them to be. Like it's, it's, it's all of this sort of

404
00:24:50,235 --> 00:24:54,065
Speaker 4:  vague language about like meaningfully changing something. So like you could

405
00:24:54,065 --> 00:24:56,865
Speaker 4:  bring it here and take a thing that's facing like this and turn it like this

406
00:24:57,005 --> 00:25:00,905
Speaker 4:  and kind of get away with calling it built

407
00:25:00,905 --> 00:25:04,305
Speaker 4:  in America. It's nonsense. But it's,

408
00:25:04,695 --> 00:25:08,425
Speaker 4:  it's true enough that I, I can see how

409
00:25:08,495 --> 00:25:11,545
Speaker 4:  someone in the organization will get up and say with a straight face,

410
00:25:12,455 --> 00:25:15,945
Speaker 4:  this thing was made in America like TM

411
00:25:16,845 --> 00:25:20,265
Speaker 4:  by the, by a very specific letter of a very specific law.

412
00:25:20,855 --> 00:25:23,945
Speaker 4:  This thing was made in America. And that's just, that just feels like where

413
00:25:23,945 --> 00:25:26,145
Speaker 4:  we're headed and it's gonna drive me insane. Yeah,

414
00:25:26,185 --> 00:25:29,265
Speaker 6:  I mean there's basically kind of two versions you can, the FTC has a full

415
00:25:29,575 --> 00:25:30,585
Speaker 6:  made in the USA

416
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:35,985
Speaker 6:  kind of system which is quite

417
00:25:36,265 --> 00:25:38,985
Speaker 6:  comprehensive and challenging And I don't think there's a realistic world

418
00:25:38,985 --> 00:25:42,785
Speaker 6:  in which this phone meets that because it requires you not

419
00:25:42,785 --> 00:25:45,505
Speaker 6:  only prove that you've built it here, but that like that a lot of the parts

420
00:25:45,655 --> 00:25:49,105
Speaker 6:  were built in the US as well. And that is just clearly beyond what this phone

421
00:25:49,105 --> 00:25:52,625
Speaker 6:  could be. But there is also basically this just kind of like, I can't remember

422
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:56,465
Speaker 6:  the actual term of it is, but it's functionally made in the SA asterisk

423
00:25:57,365 --> 00:26:01,065
Speaker 6:  and you know, wink. Yeah. It just gives all this leeway for, for

424
00:26:01,065 --> 00:26:04,945
Speaker 6:  exactly what you might have done. And it's kind of partially made in the

425
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:08,265
Speaker 6:  SA functionally, but you know, you can blur the lines a bit on where you

426
00:26:08,265 --> 00:26:10,705
Speaker 6:  use that and, And I imagine that's the space we're gonna see them in Whethers,

427
00:26:10,705 --> 00:26:13,905
Speaker 6:  there's some sort of final assembly happening in in the US

428
00:26:14,495 --> 00:26:18,025
Speaker 6:  even if that's as little as, you know, putting the SSID

429
00:26:18,225 --> 00:26:22,145
Speaker 6:  stickers on them and shoving them in a box and, and calling that assembly.

430
00:26:22,745 --> 00:26:26,505
Speaker 5:  I mean, Dom that's fascinating. This also gets at one of the other problems

431
00:26:26,575 --> 00:26:29,665
Speaker 5:  with the Trump organization running a mobile phone business, which is

432
00:26:30,685 --> 00:26:32,705
Speaker 5:  who runs the FTC,

433
00:26:33,505 --> 00:26:33,745
Speaker 4:  Right?

434
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:37,545
Speaker 5:  Is the FTC going to go after Trump mobile for

435
00:26:37,545 --> 00:26:41,225
Speaker 5:  Mismarketing? Their phone is the FCC is Brendan Carr

436
00:26:41,515 --> 00:26:44,965
Speaker 5:  gonna go after Trump mobile because they're, you know,

437
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:49,325
Speaker 5:  mishandling your data? Like I don't, it does,

438
00:26:49,325 --> 00:26:51,765
Speaker 5:  doesn't seem like it, it doesn't seem like that's gonna happen. Doesn't seem

439
00:26:51,915 --> 00:26:55,485
Speaker 5:  like I I I I'm pretty sure they can say it's made in America as much as they

440
00:26:55,485 --> 00:26:59,325
Speaker 5:  want. I do not see a way in which they could possibly get in trouble

441
00:26:59,615 --> 00:27:01,045
Speaker 5:  under the current administration.

442
00:27:01,355 --> 00:27:04,045
Speaker 6:  Well that's, 'cause that's one of the other little wrinkles around the question

443
00:27:04,045 --> 00:27:07,605
Speaker 6:  of whether this thing is real is something I was pointed out to me today

444
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:11,525
Speaker 6:  is that no one's been able to find an FCC ID for

445
00:27:11,525 --> 00:27:11,845
Speaker 6:  this phone.

446
00:27:12,425 --> 00:27:12,645
Speaker 4:  Oh,

447
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:15,405
Speaker 6:  Interesting. And you do need one, like if you want to launch a phone, you've

448
00:27:15,405 --> 00:27:19,325
Speaker 6:  gotta have that so that that could mean this really is a full reskin. They've

449
00:27:19,325 --> 00:27:22,405
Speaker 6:  changed nothing of an existing phone, in which case you could get away with

450
00:27:22,405 --> 00:27:26,325
Speaker 6:  using that FFC F-C-C-I-D. But as we said earlier, we kind of looked

451
00:27:26,325 --> 00:27:29,365
Speaker 6:  and we just can't find that phone. It doesn't seem to exist the exact carbon

452
00:27:29,435 --> 00:27:32,845
Speaker 6:  copy. So then you've gotta say, well either they don't have an

453
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:36,405
Speaker 6:  F-C-C-I-D and they really need one and they should have it by now for a September

454
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,885
Speaker 6:  launch and that's gonna mean there is no phone. Or you just say, well, you

455
00:27:39,885 --> 00:27:43,845
Speaker 6:  know, Brendan will fix it and you know, they'll, they'll escape by and

456
00:27:43,845 --> 00:27:44,365
Speaker 6:  it'll be fine.

457
00:27:44,675 --> 00:27:48,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah, we are, we are forever watching tests of there

458
00:27:48,665 --> 00:27:51,685
Speaker 4:  not being any rules and just seeing what happens. I will say

459
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:56,315
Speaker 4:  the optimistic part of me thinks all of this Trump

460
00:27:56,315 --> 00:28:00,075
Speaker 4:  stuff is a grift because it is obviously a grift to get you to pay too much

461
00:28:00,075 --> 00:28:03,875
Speaker 4:  money for a phone and too much money for a mobile carrier just to say

462
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:07,435
Speaker 4:  Trump and sure if you would like to do that,

463
00:28:07,975 --> 00:28:11,765
Speaker 4:  do it eyes wide open, know what you're doing, knock yourself out. I think

464
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:15,615
Speaker 4:  the, the like grand thesis of this

465
00:28:15,785 --> 00:28:18,935
Speaker 4:  thing and that they're trying to do, I think is sort of fascinating. Like

466
00:28:18,935 --> 00:28:22,695
Speaker 4:  a, a thing we talk about a lot is how bad

467
00:28:22,715 --> 00:28:26,375
Speaker 4:  the US phone market is because it is so controlled by a couple of

468
00:28:26,615 --> 00:28:30,495
Speaker 4:  companies, right? Like most people buy their phones in carrier

469
00:28:30,495 --> 00:28:34,295
Speaker 4:  stores. There are effectively three carriers. There are

470
00:28:34,995 --> 00:28:38,855
Speaker 4:  not that many places in those stores. And so the, the US market is

471
00:28:38,855 --> 00:28:42,815
Speaker 4:  so incredibly small and controlled and like Dom,

472
00:28:42,915 --> 00:28:46,895
Speaker 4:  I'm forever jealous of you because you, you have access to just like a vast

473
00:28:47,465 --> 00:28:51,295
Speaker 4:  ocean of cool smartphones that for a whole variety of reasons just do not

474
00:28:51,295 --> 00:28:54,615
Speaker 4:  come to the United States. Part of that is like politics with China, but

475
00:28:54,615 --> 00:28:57,975
Speaker 4:  a huge amount of it is just the way that the wireless business works here,

476
00:28:57,975 --> 00:29:01,815
Speaker 4:  which is that it's completely and utterly carrier dominated. And

477
00:29:01,855 --> 00:29:05,615
Speaker 4:  I think if we're, if we're heading to a point where what happens at the end

478
00:29:05,615 --> 00:29:09,535
Speaker 4:  of all of this MVNO stuff is that everything is

479
00:29:09,535 --> 00:29:13,415
Speaker 4:  sort of pulled out of basically Verizon, at and t

480
00:29:13,415 --> 00:29:17,335
Speaker 4:  and T-Mobile. Those companies become like infrastructure companies,

481
00:29:17,335 --> 00:29:21,295
Speaker 4:  right? In the way that like Google Cloud and AWS and Azure are infrastructure.

482
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:25,775
Speaker 4:  You have on top of that lots of new ideas about how this stuff can work.

483
00:29:25,795 --> 00:29:29,695
Speaker 4:  We get real competition in terms of like how you manage your

484
00:29:29,975 --> 00:29:32,495
Speaker 4:  wireless account and the perks that come with it and all the stuff that you

485
00:29:32,555 --> 00:29:36,455
Speaker 4:  get by having a wireless carrier there because there's real competition on

486
00:29:36,455 --> 00:29:39,935
Speaker 4:  top of this network. They can also start to make new kinds of phones. It's

487
00:29:40,015 --> 00:29:42,365
Speaker 4:  actually really easy to make phones. This is what we've been talking about.

488
00:29:42,395 --> 00:29:46,245
Speaker 4:  Like more companies should try to make phones but they don't because

489
00:29:46,265 --> 00:29:49,605
Speaker 4:  the pipeline has just been destroyed in the United States because Samsung

490
00:29:50,305 --> 00:29:54,125
Speaker 4:  and Apple own it. They've just bought the wireless industry in every

491
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:58,005
Speaker 4:  meaningful way in the United States. Google is like around and that's it.

492
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:02,085
Speaker 4:  And So I think if, if there is a world at the end of all of this,

493
00:30:03,195 --> 00:30:06,725
Speaker 4:  hopefully a, a much less thrifty one than the one that we appear to be in

494
00:30:06,725 --> 00:30:10,325
Speaker 4:  right now that is actually like we, because all of this stuff is so

495
00:30:10,325 --> 00:30:13,565
Speaker 4:  commoditized, we're gonna be able to get more of it from more directions.

496
00:30:14,485 --> 00:30:17,725
Speaker 4:  I think that could be really interesting. I don't think that's where we're

497
00:30:17,725 --> 00:30:20,885
Speaker 4:  headed because I think Apple and Samsung and the carriers remain way too

498
00:30:21,165 --> 00:30:24,885
Speaker 4:  powerful. But there is like a glimmer of a thing here that is like,

499
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:28,525
Speaker 4:  I can get access to wireless networking

500
00:30:30,175 --> 00:30:33,275
Speaker 4:  for a small amount of money and make it accessible in whatever way I want

501
00:30:33,275 --> 00:30:37,075
Speaker 4:  to other people that I think is like potentially a very powerful

502
00:30:37,075 --> 00:30:40,915
Speaker 4:  idea Right now it's Ryan Reynolds and Smartlist and Donald Trump. Yeah. But

503
00:30:40,915 --> 00:30:44,195
Speaker 4:  there's, we're starting to see other stuff and, And I think like Klarna,

504
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:48,075
Speaker 4:  the, the buy now pay later company launched an MVNO this week and it's like

505
00:30:48,365 --> 00:30:52,275
Speaker 4:  weird again. But like, I don't know, you can just start to see

506
00:30:52,445 --> 00:30:56,315
Speaker 4:  stuff happening when it's not like my entire life on my phone is not

507
00:30:56,315 --> 00:31:00,075
Speaker 4:  mediated through Verizon anymore. Interesting stuff could start to happen

508
00:31:00,335 --> 00:31:02,715
Speaker 6:  And it's just a very straightforward shift from the consumer perspective

509
00:31:02,715 --> 00:31:03,755
Speaker 6:  because you,

510
00:31:05,775 --> 00:31:08,715
Speaker 6:  if you're on Verizon, you kind of need to get your phone from Verizon nine

511
00:31:08,715 --> 00:31:10,555
Speaker 6:  times outta 10 or at least that makes it a lot easier. They make it very

512
00:31:10,555 --> 00:31:13,515
Speaker 6:  appealing for you to do that. When you're on an MVNO, it's a lot easier to

513
00:31:13,515 --> 00:31:17,395
Speaker 6:  just buy your phone from Amazon and put the SIM in

514
00:31:17,395 --> 00:31:20,275
Speaker 6:  or, or, or activate the eim or whatever it is. And I think that is a shift

515
00:31:20,275 --> 00:31:23,755
Speaker 6:  basically the UK market went through a few years ago. I know for me that's

516
00:31:23,755 --> 00:31:27,715
Speaker 6:  when I moved from, you know, getting my phones on contract from one of the

517
00:31:27,715 --> 00:31:31,675
Speaker 6:  big networks. I then switched to an MVNO about a decade ago and

518
00:31:31,675 --> 00:31:35,555
Speaker 6:  then was like, wait, I can just buy my, like buy a Nexus phone on

519
00:31:35,555 --> 00:31:38,595
Speaker 6:  Amazon and that's cheaper than doing it on the contract. And then I just

520
00:31:38,595 --> 00:31:41,755
Speaker 6:  put the sim in and that works and oh wow, I've saved so much money by doing

521
00:31:41,755 --> 00:31:44,795
Speaker 6:  this. And I think that's basically the sole shift we've had. And then as

522
00:31:44,795 --> 00:31:48,355
Speaker 6:  soon as Amazon can be the big phone player, it completely changes who's putting

523
00:31:48,355 --> 00:31:48,955
Speaker 6:  phones on the market.

524
00:31:49,315 --> 00:31:53,235
Speaker 4:  I remember I bought my wife an unlocked Pixel eight relatively recently.

525
00:31:53,235 --> 00:31:57,115
Speaker 4:  It was on this like giant sale at Best Buy And I bought her one and she

526
00:31:57,115 --> 00:32:01,035
Speaker 4:  was like blown away that I could just take her sim card out and

527
00:32:01,035 --> 00:32:04,875
Speaker 4:  put it in her new phone and it would work. Like, this is gonna sound

528
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:07,275
Speaker 4:  insane to anyone who doesn't live in the United States, but we, we have been

529
00:32:07,455 --> 00:32:11,115
Speaker 4:  so convinced by these companies that this is like a

530
00:32:11,115 --> 00:32:15,075
Speaker 4:  tightly controlled thing that only a couple of companies can manage for

531
00:32:15,075 --> 00:32:18,715
Speaker 4:  us. And that probably takes a professional to manage. No, and

532
00:32:18,715 --> 00:32:21,275
Speaker 4:  especially with eims, like you were saying, Jake, all this stuff can just

533
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:23,995
Speaker 4:  move around again now I see like there's so much potential here.

534
00:32:24,315 --> 00:32:27,515
Speaker 5:  I a hundred percent agree with you. Like even when I do this with my own

535
00:32:27,535 --> 00:32:31,195
Speaker 5:  phones, I'm like, are they gonna let me get, get away with it? Like,

536
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:35,515
Speaker 5:  it, it feels like open in a revolutionary way when

537
00:32:35,515 --> 00:32:38,395
Speaker 5:  it's actually just like, no, like this is just, this is just my data, this

538
00:32:38,395 --> 00:32:41,005
Speaker 5:  is my connectivity, this is my number. Of course I should be able to move

539
00:32:41,005 --> 00:32:44,885
Speaker 5:  it from here to here. And it is kind of a marvel that we're still able

540
00:32:44,885 --> 00:32:48,485
Speaker 5:  to do that. And you know, EIM does make it a little bit

541
00:32:48,485 --> 00:32:52,365
Speaker 5:  trickier, but in some ways, but it also makes it a

542
00:32:52,365 --> 00:32:55,165
Speaker 5:  lot more accessible in others. 'cause now you can just pop over to whatever

543
00:32:55,165 --> 00:32:56,605
Speaker 5:  network you feel like. Yeah,

544
00:32:56,615 --> 00:33:00,365
Speaker 4:  There is, again, I I suspect this ends closer

545
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:04,325
Speaker 4:  to Trump and Smartlist than it does to full democratization of wireless

546
00:33:04,325 --> 00:33:07,645
Speaker 4:  networks. But like, I gotta have something to hope for here. You know what

547
00:33:07,645 --> 00:33:10,645
Speaker 4:  I mean? All right Dom, we need to let you go here in a minute 'cause it is

548
00:33:10,645 --> 00:33:13,765
Speaker 4:  late and you need to go. But before we do, what is the coolest phone you've

549
00:33:13,765 --> 00:33:16,605
Speaker 4:  seen recently that Jake And I are never gonna get to touch in the United States?

550
00:33:17,435 --> 00:33:20,775
Speaker 6:  Oh, the Vivo X 200 Ultra, which I wrote about on

551
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:24,575
Speaker 4:  got, we got so much more stuff to talk about. Tom, thank you for being here.

552
00:36:25,825 --> 00:36:28,805
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back Jake, it's just you and me. Let's do

553
00:36:28,805 --> 00:36:28,885
Speaker 5:  It.

554
00:36:29,265 --> 00:36:33,085
Speaker 4:  Can I make a potentially insane sounding argument to you that I don't

555
00:36:33,445 --> 00:36:35,885
Speaker 4:  actually think is that insane? Okay, you're gonna think I'm crazy, but then

556
00:36:35,885 --> 00:36:37,645
Speaker 4:  at the end you're gonna think I'm not crazy. I just

557
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:41,485
Speaker 5:  Have to clarify for the audience. This is our daily work. This is just how

558
00:36:41,485 --> 00:36:43,365
Speaker 5:  it goes is true. This is like, let's go,

559
00:36:43,365 --> 00:36:46,405
Speaker 4:  Let's do it. Jake edits most of my stories and every once in a while I just

560
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:50,285
Speaker 4:  appear and I'm like, I said something absurd. Can you make sure it's obs

561
00:36:50,285 --> 00:36:54,085
Speaker 4:  as not absurd as I'm hoping it might be? I would like to argue

562
00:36:54,675 --> 00:36:58,505
Speaker 4:  that this week is a, is the end of

563
00:36:58,505 --> 00:37:02,425
Speaker 4:  television, okay? That, that like in, in a bunch of ways, you

564
00:37:02,425 --> 00:37:06,265
Speaker 4:  can mark some studies and data that came out this week as

565
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,705
Speaker 4:  the moment old school TV

566
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:10,385
Speaker 4:  died.

567
00:37:12,465 --> 00:37:14,985
Speaker 5:  I wanna hear, I wanna hear your numbers, I wanna hear your argument. Okay.

568
00:37:15,935 --> 00:37:19,905
Speaker 5:  This is one of those things where if it,

569
00:37:20,725 --> 00:37:24,545
Speaker 5:  you're not saying it died with one grand strike,

570
00:37:24,545 --> 00:37:28,385
Speaker 5:  right? This is still, it's a long arc and you're saying we've crested

571
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:32,265
Speaker 5:  and traditional TV is now its moment has passed.

572
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:36,585
Speaker 4:  I i it's more apocalyptic than that. So I, what I actually think is happening,

573
00:37:36,685 --> 00:37:40,665
Speaker 4:  so the way I've come to understand this business is that for a long time,

574
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:45,855
Speaker 4:  TV made just earth shatteringly huge amounts of money, right? Like

575
00:37:45,855 --> 00:37:48,495
Speaker 4:  that that's just true. It was an unbelievable business for a really long

576
00:37:48,495 --> 00:37:52,415
Speaker 4:  time. And then streaming came up and a lot of these companies

577
00:37:53,165 --> 00:37:57,055
Speaker 4:  made the bet that streaming is going to rise and cable is going to

578
00:37:57,055 --> 00:38:00,935
Speaker 4:  fall. And by cable, I mean cable and broadcast, which is a, an an important

579
00:38:00,935 --> 00:38:04,575
Speaker 4:  distinction that I, I will make a couple of times here that

580
00:38:05,045 --> 00:38:08,895
Speaker 4:  that is going to fall, but it is going to throw off so much money while it

581
00:38:08,895 --> 00:38:11,655
Speaker 4:  slowly dies because a lot of people who have cable are gonna keep having

582
00:38:11,655 --> 00:38:14,255
Speaker 4:  cable and there's a lot of money in cable and it's a very sticky thing that

583
00:38:14,485 --> 00:38:17,655
Speaker 4:  like eventually everyone who has cable will die and the cable business will

584
00:38:17,655 --> 00:38:20,535
Speaker 4:  die with it. But until then cable will be around and it'll throw off lots

585
00:38:20,535 --> 00:38:24,215
Speaker 4:  of money. So we're gonna keep investing in cable that, as we've talked about

586
00:38:24,215 --> 00:38:27,855
Speaker 4:  a bunch on this show, has been slowly shifting faster

587
00:38:27,995 --> 00:38:30,935
Speaker 4:  and faster and faster, right? I think there was a sense that maybe this was

588
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:34,775
Speaker 4:  like a multiple decade change into like maybe

589
00:38:34,805 --> 00:38:38,755
Speaker 4:  it's a one decade change. And what we've learned is that this

590
00:38:38,755 --> 00:38:42,075
Speaker 4:  is, it's a momentum business, right? Because so much of it is about where

591
00:38:42,075 --> 00:38:45,955
Speaker 4:  do you put ad dollars that in theory everybody could

592
00:38:45,985 --> 00:38:49,915
Speaker 4:  just move it tomorrow because if, if all the ad money goes away,

593
00:38:51,025 --> 00:38:54,955
Speaker 4:  none of it works anymore because for, for a variety of

594
00:38:54,955 --> 00:38:58,075
Speaker 4:  reasons that we can get into. And so what I think there is a thing that happened

595
00:38:58,075 --> 00:39:01,995
Speaker 4:  this week, which is the Nielsen gauge. Nielsen is the company that

596
00:39:01,995 --> 00:39:05,555
Speaker 4:  has done TV ratings for forever. The gauge is the thing they've been doing

597
00:39:05,555 --> 00:39:08,915
Speaker 4:  since 2021, I believe, to also try and measure

598
00:39:08,985 --> 00:39:12,835
Speaker 4:  streaming. And basically everybody says it's an imperfect measurement, but

599
00:39:12,835 --> 00:39:16,675
Speaker 4:  it is sort of directionally useful over time. And what

600
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:20,835
Speaker 4:  happened, this most recent version of the gauge was that

601
00:39:20,905 --> 00:39:24,635
Speaker 4:  streaming was bigger than cable and broadcast TV

602
00:39:24,735 --> 00:39:25,755
Speaker 4:  For the first time ever.

603
00:39:27,585 --> 00:39:31,475
Speaker 4:  This is like a hugely meaningful moment, right? So the, the number was that

604
00:39:31,475 --> 00:39:34,555
Speaker 4:  streaming accounted for 44% of viewership

605
00:39:34,915 --> 00:39:38,835
Speaker 4:  broadcasting cable accounted for 44.2%.

606
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:42,435
Speaker 4:  So 44.8 versus 44.2. If you were to say, David,

607
00:39:42,435 --> 00:39:46,035
Speaker 4:  where's the other 11%? I don't have a good answer for you. That's, there's

608
00:39:46,035 --> 00:39:47,435
Speaker 4:  like an other category that I,

609
00:39:47,655 --> 00:39:51,595
Speaker 5:  The TV is just off digress. You're just, where it's frame TVs, you're just

610
00:39:51,595 --> 00:39:53,075
Speaker 5:  looking at the art. Yeah. Like, yeah,

611
00:39:53,075 --> 00:39:56,955
Speaker 4:  Something like that. But anyway, so that, that's a big change and

612
00:39:57,095 --> 00:40:00,835
Speaker 4:  the momentum is just nuts. Can I just read you a bunch of numbers from your

613
00:40:00,835 --> 00:40:01,355
Speaker 4:  support? Yeah, I'd

614
00:40:01,355 --> 00:40:01,595
Speaker 5:  Love, love.

615
00:40:01,855 --> 00:40:05,675
Speaker 4:  So YouTube, Maine, which is sort of the, the industry term for like

616
00:40:05,675 --> 00:40:09,635
Speaker 4:  regular YouTube, not YouTube tv, not YouTube shorts, just YouTube, the, the

617
00:40:09,735 --> 00:40:13,635
Speaker 4:  proper YouTube app. Google as always very good at branding.

618
00:40:14,305 --> 00:40:18,275
Speaker 4:  YouTube main accounts for 12.5% of all streaming,

619
00:40:18,275 --> 00:40:21,315
Speaker 4:  which is as big as Netflix and Disney plus combined.

620
00:40:22,055 --> 00:40:25,995
Speaker 4:  It is it, it has been just dominant in this space for the last couple of

621
00:40:26,075 --> 00:40:29,555
Speaker 4:  years. It's up 120% in four years. Like, well,

622
00:40:29,555 --> 00:40:33,195
Speaker 5:  And we've, we've talked about it, how, how YouTube's biggest platform is

623
00:40:33,215 --> 00:40:36,195
Speaker 5:  now the tv. Yeah. Which I, I like still feels

624
00:40:36,785 --> 00:40:40,515
Speaker 5:  bewildering to me. Like YouTube, I, my own YouTube usage

625
00:40:40,655 --> 00:40:44,195
Speaker 5:  has increased dramatically over the past like five years even,

626
00:40:45,205 --> 00:40:48,715
Speaker 5:  which is honestly on a personal level, bad. It's not good. I should spend

627
00:40:48,715 --> 00:40:52,635
Speaker 5:  less time on YouTube, but like for me it's still very much a, a, a

628
00:40:52,735 --> 00:40:56,555
Speaker 5:  laptop thing. But you look at the numbers and, and you look at where

629
00:40:56,555 --> 00:41:00,195
Speaker 5:  their product efforts are going and it is to the tv and these numbers very

630
00:41:00,195 --> 00:41:02,115
Speaker 5:  much show you why. Yeah,

631
00:41:02,235 --> 00:41:05,635
Speaker 4:  I remember for years I would meet with people at YouTube and they would say

632
00:41:06,215 --> 00:41:09,355
Speaker 4:  The living room is our fastest growing screen. But it was for a long time

633
00:41:09,355 --> 00:41:12,715
Speaker 4:  it was like, it went from very small to still very small but bigger, right?

634
00:41:12,715 --> 00:41:16,675
Speaker 4:  And like fastest growing is a relative term, but then kind of in the last

635
00:41:17,115 --> 00:41:20,635
Speaker 4:  18 months it started to turn to like, no, this is actually our biggest platform.

636
00:41:21,055 --> 00:41:24,995
Speaker 4:  And now they're starting to redesign YouTube around the

637
00:41:24,995 --> 00:41:28,915
Speaker 4:  tv. Like we're seeing real TV first parts of

638
00:41:28,915 --> 00:41:32,755
Speaker 4:  YouTube in a way that I think is really fascinating. But I, I wrote

639
00:41:32,835 --> 00:41:36,125
Speaker 4:  a thing earlier this year for YouTube's 20th anniversary that was basically

640
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:39,925
Speaker 4:  like YouTube is just winning the entertainment industry. And that is,

641
00:41:39,925 --> 00:41:43,685
Speaker 4:  that continues to be true. But the fact that it was up 120%

642
00:41:44,145 --> 00:41:48,085
Speaker 4:  in the last four years just blew my mind. Like think about how dominant YouTube

643
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:51,525
Speaker 4:  was in 2021 and it has more than doubled

644
00:41:51,905 --> 00:41:54,765
Speaker 4:  in, in as on television since then. Insane.

645
00:41:54,765 --> 00:41:55,485
Speaker 5:  Seems impossible.

646
00:41:55,485 --> 00:41:59,205
Speaker 4:  So that's just one in like regular streaming

647
00:41:59,405 --> 00:42:02,325
Speaker 4:  services. I think we, we think of YouTube as kind of its own thing, but in

648
00:42:02,325 --> 00:42:06,085
Speaker 4:  the realm of like traditional streaming services. Netflix has been in first

649
00:42:06,085 --> 00:42:09,965
Speaker 4:  place for four years running, it's up 27% over the

650
00:42:09,965 --> 00:42:13,725
Speaker 4:  four years that the gauge has been running. And it accounts for like seven,

651
00:42:14,645 --> 00:42:17,605
Speaker 4:  I think seven and a half percent of streaming. So like huge

652
00:42:18,155 --> 00:42:21,805
Speaker 4:  Netflix is like the winner of the streaming war in like every

653
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:24,805
Speaker 4:  meaningful way and is still getting its as kicked by YouTube. But anyway,

654
00:42:24,805 --> 00:42:27,845
Speaker 4:  so Netflix growing like crazy, YouTube growing like crazy

655
00:42:28,745 --> 00:42:32,205
Speaker 4:  in that same period of time, broadcast according to

656
00:42:32,205 --> 00:42:35,885
Speaker 4:  Nielsen's Gauge has been down 21% and cable has been down

657
00:42:35,885 --> 00:42:36,965
Speaker 4:  39%.

658
00:42:37,235 --> 00:42:40,965
Speaker 5:  That is falling much faster than I would expect. Yes. And like,

659
00:42:40,965 --> 00:42:43,965
Speaker 5:  that's just absent the, the ad dollars problem, right? This is just people

660
00:42:43,965 --> 00:42:45,485
Speaker 5:  are shifting their behaviors

661
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:51,045
Speaker 5:  And I, I really expected this, this industry to sort of

662
00:42:51,045 --> 00:42:55,005
Speaker 5:  just like chug along pretty indefinitely. And

663
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:58,525
Speaker 5:  those are some dramatic devastating

664
00:42:59,405 --> 00:43:02,845
Speaker 5:  declines that are really going to imperil the ability to operate those businesses.

665
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:08,245
Speaker 5:  And I think I, I mean I suspect for a lot of our listeners, and certainly

666
00:43:08,245 --> 00:43:11,645
Speaker 5:  for me, it's like yeah, of course. Right? Like I, I

667
00:43:12,235 --> 00:43:14,965
Speaker 5:  have never had a cable subscription of my own, right?

668
00:43:15,795 --> 00:43:19,765
Speaker 5:  Because, you know, by the time I was out of college, right, like

669
00:43:19,835 --> 00:43:23,765
Speaker 5:  streaming was available, why would I not just stream everything

670
00:43:23,765 --> 00:43:27,725
Speaker 5:  that I, that I need on the rare occasions, right? I went to, I went

671
00:43:27,725 --> 00:43:31,405
Speaker 5:  to a bar to watch the finale of Breaking Bad.

672
00:43:31,645 --> 00:43:34,605
Speaker 5:  I think that was, that was the, the like the one where I was like, okay,

673
00:43:35,365 --> 00:43:39,005
Speaker 5:  I do need cable for this. But that just like, doesn't even, that doesn't

674
00:43:39,005 --> 00:43:42,765
Speaker 5:  happen anymore, right? Like that's scenario doesn't come up where the thing

675
00:43:42,945 --> 00:43:43,965
Speaker 5:  you want to watch,

676
00:43:45,505 --> 00:43:49,405
Speaker 5:  you can't get access to at home. Like one way or another.

677
00:43:49,665 --> 00:43:52,765
Speaker 5:  You can find a way to stream it, even if you have to sign up for an entire

678
00:43:52,765 --> 00:43:56,365
Speaker 5:  service that you don't want, or even if you have to sign up for like a, a

679
00:43:56,365 --> 00:44:00,325
Speaker 5:  bundled cable streaming service for a month. But it's all,

680
00:44:00,325 --> 00:44:04,125
Speaker 5:  it's all doable and it's, and it's like, you know, there's much

681
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:07,485
Speaker 5:  to complain about in terms of, oh, okay, we've just recreated the cable bundle

682
00:44:07,485 --> 00:44:10,925
Speaker 5:  in a million different ways. Yep, sure. Great. It turns out that streaming

683
00:44:11,185 --> 00:44:14,845
Speaker 5:  did not exactly save us a ton of money, and it is in fact wildly

684
00:44:14,845 --> 00:44:17,685
Speaker 5:  complicated. But these things are all

685
00:44:18,365 --> 00:44:21,685
Speaker 5:  available. It's all possible. You have those options in front of you.

686
00:44:22,185 --> 00:44:25,965
Speaker 5:  And I, I think like that has actually accelerated pretty

687
00:44:26,165 --> 00:44:29,485
Speaker 5:  dramatically probably just over the, the recent, like five years maybe during

688
00:44:29,505 --> 00:44:33,085
Speaker 5:  the time that we've seen that big decline, right? I think

689
00:44:33,445 --> 00:44:36,205
Speaker 5:  a lot of these stragglers were the traditional

690
00:44:37,115 --> 00:44:40,965
Speaker 5:  broadcast networks, and now you're finally going to be able to get those

691
00:44:40,965 --> 00:44:44,565
Speaker 5:  like major live events that traditionally you still

692
00:44:44,565 --> 00:44:48,245
Speaker 5:  would've had to have a cable subscription to get access to. Now

693
00:44:48,245 --> 00:44:51,965
Speaker 5:  that's all streaming. There's very little that you need to have cable

694
00:44:52,025 --> 00:44:55,765
Speaker 5:  for. You need to have cable if you just wanna like, have that experience

695
00:44:55,765 --> 00:44:58,045
Speaker 5:  of being able to flip through the channels and not really worry about it

696
00:44:58,045 --> 00:44:58,325
Speaker 5:  too much.

697
00:44:58,465 --> 00:45:02,125
Speaker 4:  And this becomes like a self-fulfilling thing over time, right? Like, I'm

698
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:05,605
Speaker 4:  thinking a lot about sports rights And I remember not that many years ago,

699
00:45:06,545 --> 00:45:10,365
Speaker 4:  all of the leagues made a point to stick with the broadcast networks

700
00:45:10,365 --> 00:45:14,165
Speaker 4:  because what they kept saying was, it's important to us that we have a product

701
00:45:14,165 --> 00:45:17,525
Speaker 4:  that is accessible to everybody and, and in a few spots would leave money

702
00:45:17,525 --> 00:45:21,485
Speaker 4:  on the table in order to do so. Right? Like it's, it matters to the NFL that

703
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:25,245
Speaker 4:  it is essentially accessible to everyone, even if

704
00:45:25,245 --> 00:45:29,045
Speaker 4:  that means not letting Amazon give you all of the money in the known

705
00:45:29,245 --> 00:45:32,925
Speaker 4:  universe to do so. But the thing that has changed, right, is that you, you

706
00:45:32,925 --> 00:45:35,965
Speaker 4:  can make an increasing case that actually if you wanna reach everybody all

707
00:45:35,965 --> 00:45:39,925
Speaker 4:  at once, the move is to do it on Netflix. That, like, I

708
00:45:40,045 --> 00:45:43,165
Speaker 4:  I think if you just took a poll of people that, you know,

709
00:45:43,955 --> 00:45:47,765
Speaker 4:  more of them are likely to have Netflix than to have like a quick way

710
00:45:47,765 --> 00:45:51,645
Speaker 4:  to watch Fox. And that is a, a

711
00:45:51,775 --> 00:45:55,685
Speaker 4:  giant cultural shift that I think we're only starting to see the money follow.

712
00:45:56,505 --> 00:45:59,605
Speaker 4:  But that's the thing, like when I see numbers like this, it's like every,

713
00:45:59,605 --> 00:46:03,125
Speaker 4:  everybody in this page watches the Nielsen cage. Like say what you want about

714
00:46:03,125 --> 00:46:07,085
Speaker 4:  the numbers. It is, it is the gold standard of how the

715
00:46:07,405 --> 00:46:10,205
Speaker 4:  advertisers in particular look at this stuff and they're going to look at

716
00:46:10,205 --> 00:46:14,165
Speaker 4:  this and they're gonna say, oh, it moved, not it's moving, but like it moved.

717
00:46:14,345 --> 00:46:17,685
Speaker 4:  We have this, this thing that we have been thinking was going to eventually

718
00:46:17,685 --> 00:46:19,485
Speaker 4:  changed has now changed.

719
00:46:20,075 --> 00:46:22,005
Speaker 5:  Well, it's funny, we, we were talking about

720
00:46:24,385 --> 00:46:27,765
Speaker 5:  Warner Brothers discovery splitting in half last week,

721
00:46:28,425 --> 00:46:32,005
Speaker 5:  and one of the re I mean, part of it is because Z Love has done a disastrous

722
00:46:32,005 --> 00:46:35,805
Speaker 5:  job, but another part of it is like they're splitting it into

723
00:46:36,265 --> 00:46:40,125
Speaker 5:  the thing that streams really well and the stuff that is cable tv and that's

724
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:41,645
Speaker 5:  just their good luck,

725
00:46:41,855 --> 00:46:44,765
Speaker 4:  Right? It does make a bunch of that stuff make sense. And we should, like,

726
00:46:44,765 --> 00:46:48,125
Speaker 4:  Comcast, Comcast, by the way, disclosure an investor in Vox Media,

727
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:53,205
Speaker 4:  giant fans of ours did the same thing. They, they were like, okay, we're

728
00:46:53,205 --> 00:46:56,685
Speaker 4:  gonna take the thing that's kind of working, which is peacock, which is

729
00:46:57,105 --> 00:47:00,405
Speaker 4:  by the way, WAMP, wamp like at the, at the very bottom, it's like the lowest

730
00:47:00,745 --> 00:47:04,245
Speaker 4:  one that the Nielsen gauge even ranks. There's like, Hey,

731
00:47:04,305 --> 00:47:04,845
Speaker 5:  That's success.

732
00:47:04,845 --> 00:47:06,965
Speaker 4:  It's peacock. And then it's other like, you did

733
00:47:06,965 --> 00:47:10,645
Speaker 5:  It, they were popping champagne bottles when they made that list.

734
00:47:11,275 --> 00:47:11,565
Speaker 5:  Okay,

735
00:47:11,635 --> 00:47:14,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah. They're like with the, we have the logo on there now. That's all, that's

736
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:17,605
Speaker 4:  all we need. But they did the same thing. They, they took the thing that

737
00:47:17,725 --> 00:47:20,565
Speaker 4:  works and then split off all of the cable companies. And it was like

738
00:47:21,495 --> 00:47:25,445
Speaker 4:  those companies now are just being essentially put out to pasture. Like

739
00:47:25,615 --> 00:47:29,495
Speaker 4:  there is this sense that not that long ago, there was

740
00:47:29,495 --> 00:47:33,255
Speaker 4:  this belief that like, oh, we, we should keep ESPN because

741
00:47:33,275 --> 00:47:36,935
Speaker 4:  it funds the rest of Disney and it will for a long time. And

742
00:47:37,205 --> 00:47:41,175
Speaker 4:  that idea is just quickly going away everywhere. And, and this is what

743
00:47:41,175 --> 00:47:44,935
Speaker 4:  I mean by I think like we we're going to look at this as the moment

744
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:48,975
Speaker 4:  it died because like everybody has been waiting for this sort of moment

745
00:47:49,035 --> 00:47:53,015
Speaker 4:  of confirmation that the change has happened. And this

746
00:47:53,015 --> 00:47:56,935
Speaker 4:  is not young people stream more. This is not like cable nevers

747
00:47:56,935 --> 00:48:00,855
Speaker 4:  or grow. This is, this is people in America are streaming

748
00:48:00,855 --> 00:48:04,535
Speaker 4:  more than they're watching cable. And, and even Nielsen's thing I think was

749
00:48:04,535 --> 00:48:07,535
Speaker 4:  like the, these numbers are very close, so they're like, it'll probably shift

750
00:48:07,555 --> 00:48:11,375
Speaker 4:  and you know, sports will start and it'll jump up again. But they were like,

751
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:15,215
Speaker 4:  the, the trend is, is unchanging and it very soon

752
00:48:15,245 --> 00:48:18,535
Speaker 4:  will be permanent that the streaming number is higher. And once that happens,

753
00:48:19,905 --> 00:48:23,755
Speaker 4:  it's, it's gonna get, it's gonna get weirder and like the money

754
00:48:23,755 --> 00:48:25,035
Speaker 4:  is going to move even faster.

755
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:29,155
Speaker 5:  I do wonder if there is a floor, right? Like you still hear about like

756
00:48:29,305 --> 00:48:32,355
Speaker 5:  there's somehow, there's still some a OL dial up customers. Sure. And they're

757
00:48:32,355 --> 00:48:36,235
Speaker 5:  just like, they're like, I, it works. I'm not changing. I, I'm sure there's

758
00:48:36,235 --> 00:48:39,155
Speaker 5:  a lot of people who just have cable and they're just never gonna unsubscribe.

759
00:48:39,475 --> 00:48:43,395
Speaker 5:  I could see it like falling to a point and just staying there steadily

760
00:48:43,475 --> 00:48:47,355
Speaker 5:  for a while. But honestly, I, it, it sounds

761
00:48:47,355 --> 00:48:50,715
Speaker 5:  crazy. It really does sound crazy to be like, actually TV's TV's dead. It's

762
00:48:50,715 --> 00:48:54,675
Speaker 5:  done. But, but I think you might be right like this, this actually is

763
00:48:54,795 --> 00:48:58,555
Speaker 5:  a really momentous case. You have sold me on this. Did it, it does mean that

764
00:48:58,555 --> 00:49:02,435
Speaker 5:  I think we're gonna probably continue to see some, some big changes in the

765
00:49:02,435 --> 00:49:06,155
Speaker 5:  streaming space too as everybody races to take advantage of that growth,

766
00:49:06,445 --> 00:49:10,195
Speaker 5:  right? Because this means there is more opportunity there. Now it also means

767
00:49:10,195 --> 00:49:13,795
Speaker 5:  they just by necessity have to go over there. One of the big things that

768
00:49:13,795 --> 00:49:17,075
Speaker 5:  we haven't talked about yet that I'm curious how much it is contributing

769
00:49:17,075 --> 00:49:20,995
Speaker 5:  to this is the fast channels, because that feels like

770
00:49:21,035 --> 00:49:24,955
Speaker 5:  a relatively new trend to me, and it seems like they

771
00:49:24,955 --> 00:49:28,555
Speaker 5:  are are, you know, there, there are new ones launching

772
00:49:28,645 --> 00:49:29,955
Speaker 5:  every single week somehow,

773
00:49:31,575 --> 00:49:35,235
Speaker 5:  and that, that seemed to be very popular. So I'm, I'm really curious if that

774
00:49:35,495 --> 00:49:39,475
Speaker 5:  is contributing to this. If part of this is that people are going, oh,

775
00:49:40,275 --> 00:49:43,995
Speaker 5:  I can, I can actually just watch stuff for free. Like there are maybe even

776
00:49:44,045 --> 00:49:47,675
Speaker 5:  fewer ads on these free streaming TV channels.

777
00:49:48,505 --> 00:49:52,315
Speaker 5:  Like what, what am I doing with cable still? Like, I'm paying a hundred dollars

778
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:55,555
Speaker 5:  or more a month for this giant bundle of channels. I don't even know what's

779
00:49:55,555 --> 00:49:56,155
Speaker 5:  on half of them.

780
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:01,935
Speaker 5:  And I, you know, the fast channels feel like one of those things

781
00:50:01,995 --> 00:50:05,735
Speaker 5:  that's like, if, if you had started that, you know,

782
00:50:06,075 --> 00:50:10,015
Speaker 5:  at the origin of streaming services, that business model wouldn't have made

783
00:50:10,015 --> 00:50:12,735
Speaker 5:  sense because the ad dollars wouldn't have been there. But now the ad dollars

784
00:50:12,795 --> 00:50:16,335
Speaker 5:  are shifting there. There's all kinds of new things you can do with streaming.

785
00:50:16,355 --> 00:50:19,055
Speaker 5:  And So I think we are gonna continue to see number one more of these things

786
00:50:19,055 --> 00:50:22,855
Speaker 5:  launch, but probably some new models pop up And I, I mean we,

787
00:50:22,855 --> 00:50:25,815
Speaker 5:  we also already see this with like Netflix and basically every other premium

788
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:29,445
Speaker 5:  streaming service shifting to this. Like actually just, just watch the ads

789
00:50:30,285 --> 00:50:33,845
Speaker 4:  Approach. Totally. And I think that, yeah, the fast channels are fascinating

790
00:50:33,845 --> 00:50:37,365
Speaker 4:  because they're just so easy in a way that I think

791
00:50:37,905 --> 00:50:41,605
Speaker 4:  we, we, I, we talked about this for years, right? That like the biggest problem

792
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:44,525
Speaker 4:  with streaming services is it's a hell of a lot of work to figure out what

793
00:50:44,525 --> 00:50:48,285
Speaker 4:  you wanna watch. And what I, what I miss about cable

794
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:51,885
Speaker 4:  is I could just turn on my TV and it, it was just showing me television

795
00:50:52,305 --> 00:50:56,125
Speaker 4:  And I would just like leave it on a channel and it would play things

796
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:59,965
Speaker 4:  like that. That sounds different now, but that's what it was and it was great.

797
00:51:00,545 --> 00:51:04,245
Speaker 4:  But now, like the Roku channel is the fifth most popular

798
00:51:04,245 --> 00:51:04,925
Speaker 4:  streaming service.

799
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:05,885
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that's

800
00:51:05,885 --> 00:51:09,505
Speaker 4:  Incredible. The Roku channel like insane and the Roku channel

801
00:51:09,685 --> 00:51:13,585
Speaker 4:  is, is just, it's Pure a fast channel and the only reason it's popular

802
00:51:13,925 --> 00:51:17,145
Speaker 4:  is because it's there because lots and lots and lots of people have Rokus

803
00:51:17,325 --> 00:51:20,905
Speaker 4:  and the Roku channel just has a lot of free stuff just sitting there

804
00:51:21,565 --> 00:51:25,385
Speaker 4:  for you to watch. And Tubi is also on this list to

805
00:51:25,385 --> 00:51:28,985
Speaker 4:  be more popular than Peacock. Tough day for

806
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:32,865
Speaker 4:  Peacock. But, but you're totally right. And, and these two things

807
00:51:32,885 --> 00:51:35,785
Speaker 4:  are starting to sit side by side, right? Where you, like you have Netflix

808
00:51:36,005 --> 00:51:39,865
Speaker 4:  for like the the high end premium stuff that I sort of

809
00:51:39,865 --> 00:51:43,145
Speaker 4:  go watch on purpose. And then you have Tub be in the Roku channel for just

810
00:51:43,145 --> 00:51:45,505
Speaker 4:  like, I just, just show me something and like

811
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:50,025
Speaker 5:  I'm consistently surprised at, at how much good programming

812
00:51:50,025 --> 00:51:51,865
Speaker 5:  is available on the fast channels,

813
00:51:53,565 --> 00:51:57,225
Speaker 5:  the frequency with which I will look up where I can watch a movie or TV show

814
00:51:57,485 --> 00:52:00,305
Speaker 5:  and they're like, oh, it's available with ads on this free thing. And I'm

815
00:52:00,305 --> 00:52:04,185
Speaker 5:  like, oh, with ads. And then it is like, not even that many ads like it,

816
00:52:04,255 --> 00:52:08,145
Speaker 5:  it's it, they are what the best value in streaming. It is really incredible.

817
00:52:08,285 --> 00:52:11,545
Speaker 4:  No question. I do think it's a lot of ads And I think the problem is

818
00:52:12,405 --> 00:52:15,065
Speaker 4:  we are being sort of re desensitized

819
00:52:15,745 --> 00:52:16,905
Speaker 5:  A ad may be true, that may be true.

820
00:52:16,905 --> 00:52:19,225
Speaker 4:  Like do you remember when they first started showing ads on some of these

821
00:52:19,225 --> 00:52:23,145
Speaker 4:  streaming services again? And it would be like one 32nd ad two

822
00:52:23,145 --> 00:52:26,585
Speaker 4:  times a show and you'd be like, ah, I'm gonna watch an ad.

823
00:52:26,965 --> 00:52:27,505
Speaker 5:  How dare you.

824
00:52:27,735 --> 00:52:31,585
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And now we're back to like, there was news last week that Amazon doubled

825
00:52:31,605 --> 00:52:34,825
Speaker 4:  its ad inventory and like, I'm not gonna notice it's just Right. We're just

826
00:52:34,825 --> 00:52:38,705
Speaker 4:  back to having too many ads all the time. And so the one that kills

827
00:52:38,705 --> 00:52:42,345
Speaker 4:  me on the Fast services, And I don't know if they fixed this because

828
00:52:42,585 --> 00:52:46,145
Speaker 4:  I, I either just stopped noticing it or they got better at it, but

829
00:52:46,295 --> 00:52:50,105
Speaker 4:  they are just trash at knowing when to insert ads.

830
00:52:50,615 --> 00:52:54,185
Speaker 4:  It's just like something in their system is just like every seven minutes

831
00:52:54,215 --> 00:52:58,025
Speaker 4:  just due two ads no matter what is going on. And so it'll be in the middle

832
00:52:58,045 --> 00:52:58,785
Speaker 4:  of a person's

833
00:52:59,145 --> 00:52:59,505
Speaker 5:  Sentence that's

834
00:52:59,505 --> 00:53:02,465
Speaker 4:  Not good and it'll just be like, buy Charmin toilet paper and then it'll

835
00:53:02,465 --> 00:53:05,945
Speaker 4:  go back to the person's sentence in the middle. And I'm just like, this is

836
00:53:05,945 --> 00:53:09,425
Speaker 4:  not a good user experience. I'm fine with the ads, but like, can we put them

837
00:53:09,425 --> 00:53:10,025
Speaker 4:  where they go?

838
00:53:11,095 --> 00:53:14,535
Speaker 5:  I, I've still may, I've just been lucky. I've still had the, like the other

839
00:53:14,535 --> 00:53:17,135
Speaker 5:  side of the experience where someone s like, I can't, I can't believe this

840
00:53:17,135 --> 00:53:20,135
Speaker 5:  ads on this thing. And then they'll show again. It's like they'll show me

841
00:53:20,135 --> 00:53:23,935
Speaker 5:  32nd spot at the, the beginning of something and then I just watch a two

842
00:53:23,935 --> 00:53:27,405
Speaker 5:  hour movie And I'm like, like I think you guys messed up here. Like, there

843
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:30,525
Speaker 5:  you needed to make me pay for this. It is the

844
00:53:30,605 --> 00:53:33,885
Speaker 4:  Greatest scam in television when they're like, we're gonna show you three

845
00:53:33,885 --> 00:53:36,525
Speaker 4:  minutes of ads and then you get the whole movie ad free and I'm just like,

846
00:53:36,525 --> 00:53:38,365
Speaker 4:  tight, I'm gonna leave for three minutes. Yeah.

847
00:53:38,385 --> 00:53:39,125
Speaker 5:  I'm like, you guys just,

848
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:40,005
Speaker 4:  What are we accomplishing here?

849
00:53:40,165 --> 00:53:43,445
Speaker 5:  Didn't know you had this in your catalog. Like you, you, you just forgot

850
00:53:43,645 --> 00:53:45,125
Speaker 5:  to sell ads against this. Yep,

851
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:48,205
Speaker 4:  Yep. Yeah. I'm just like, I'm gonna go make popcorn and then I'm gonna come

852
00:53:48,205 --> 00:53:51,565
Speaker 4:  back and I'm gonna watch an ad free movie. Like you can play an ad on my

853
00:53:51,565 --> 00:53:52,965
Speaker 4:  television while I'm not here. Right. This

854
00:53:53,035 --> 00:53:56,805
Speaker 5:  This is part of the thing. Like it is true, you are not always getting the

855
00:53:56,805 --> 00:53:59,965
Speaker 5:  best program. Sometimes it's great, but sometimes it is. In fact it's like

856
00:53:59,965 --> 00:54:03,925
Speaker 5:  that it is the c tier of movies that are on these things

857
00:54:03,925 --> 00:54:06,725
Speaker 5:  sometimes. But you know what, there are

858
00:54:06,725 --> 00:54:08,645
Speaker 4:  A lot of good bad movies out there. Well, you know what I mean?

859
00:54:09,035 --> 00:54:11,685
Speaker 5:  This is the thing like Netflix, you look through Netflix sometimes and you're

860
00:54:11,685 --> 00:54:15,605
Speaker 5:  like, I've seen all of these I've seen like, and I'm like, I I need

861
00:54:15,605 --> 00:54:19,485
Speaker 5:  that like weird tier of movies that you don't feel like paying for

862
00:54:19,485 --> 00:54:22,685
Speaker 5:  Netflix because not a lot of people are gonna watch them. But I've, I've

863
00:54:22,685 --> 00:54:24,805
Speaker 5:  seen, you know, I know you've got

864
00:54:25,665 --> 00:54:27,875
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I'm, I'm completely with you. I've,

865
00:54:27,875 --> 00:54:31,395
Speaker 5:  I've watched Hot Frosty five times now. Like, let's like what's next?

866
00:54:32,725 --> 00:54:36,575
Speaker 4:  Okay, first of all, hot Frosty is great justice

867
00:54:36,635 --> 00:54:37,495
Speaker 4:  for hot Frosty.

868
00:54:38,255 --> 00:54:41,495
Speaker 5:  I, I said nothing to to suggest otherwise.

869
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:45,895
Speaker 4:  There are very few things in my life that I enjoy as much as that period

870
00:54:45,895 --> 00:54:49,815
Speaker 4:  between Thanksgiving and like December 23rd where there's just

871
00:54:49,815 --> 00:54:53,655
Speaker 4:  an infinite supply of bad new Christmas movies. If

872
00:54:53,655 --> 00:54:56,935
Speaker 4:  you're ever like, who are these for? The answers me. I watch them. I am the

873
00:54:56,935 --> 00:54:58,295
Speaker 4:  reason they keep getting made,

874
00:54:59,185 --> 00:55:01,815
Speaker 5:  Lemme tell you. And I'm not sad tell this is why streaming is winning.

875
00:55:03,575 --> 00:55:06,295
Speaker 4:  'cause now there's more crappy stuff for me to watch. It's great times. Okay,

876
00:55:06,295 --> 00:55:09,935
Speaker 4:  wait on the TV is dying. Can I, can I offer you one more quick

877
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:14,015
Speaker 4:  study on, I'm telling you this is like an interesting week for, oh no,

878
00:55:14,085 --> 00:55:17,935
Speaker 4:  TV's dead. So there was, there's this group at,

879
00:55:18,355 --> 00:55:21,855
Speaker 4:  at Oxford called the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism

880
00:55:22,515 --> 00:55:26,415
Speaker 4:  and every year they do a big report on sort of the state of journalism

881
00:55:26,415 --> 00:55:30,185
Speaker 4:  in the world. It's, it's real bleak. It's,

882
00:55:30,185 --> 00:55:33,865
Speaker 4:  it's just what I'll say about that. It's not great to be a journalist.

883
00:55:33,865 --> 00:55:37,745
Speaker 4:  There's a lot of stuff going on. The PE misinformation is everywhere, but

884
00:55:37,745 --> 00:55:41,705
Speaker 4:  there are, there were a couple of interesting shifts, particularly

885
00:55:41,765 --> 00:55:45,665
Speaker 4:  in the United States that I thought were very interesting and also

886
00:55:45,665 --> 00:55:49,625
Speaker 4:  very bad news for television. So lemme just read you from this report.

887
00:55:49,625 --> 00:55:53,025
Speaker 4:  It says the proportion accessing news via social media and video networks

888
00:55:53,025 --> 00:55:56,665
Speaker 4:  in the United States is sharply up at 54%. So

889
00:55:56,665 --> 00:56:00,425
Speaker 4:  54% of people are getting news via social media and video networks. Video

890
00:56:00,425 --> 00:56:03,625
Speaker 4:  networks being like TikTok and stuff like that. That number is actually lower

891
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:07,345
Speaker 4:  than I would've guessed, but is is high.

892
00:56:07,485 --> 00:56:10,705
Speaker 4:  And I think probably the younger the audience, the higher that number is

893
00:56:10,705 --> 00:56:14,505
Speaker 4:  gonna be. That number 54% overtook

894
00:56:14,535 --> 00:56:17,985
Speaker 4:  both TV news, which is 50% and news

895
00:56:18,025 --> 00:56:21,545
Speaker 4:  websites slash apps 48% For the first time. So

896
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:25,725
Speaker 4:  now For the first time ever, social media and video networks

897
00:56:25,725 --> 00:56:28,965
Speaker 4:  are the dominant place by which people in the United States

898
00:56:29,955 --> 00:56:33,775
Speaker 4:  access their news. And again, the the trends suggest

899
00:56:33,775 --> 00:56:36,975
Speaker 4:  that number is only going to get even further away. TV is down

900
00:56:37,155 --> 00:56:41,095
Speaker 4:  22% online news sites are down 21% print is down

901
00:56:41,095 --> 00:56:44,735
Speaker 4:  33%. Like there's only one number

902
00:56:44,745 --> 00:56:48,535
Speaker 4:  going up. And it's, it's social media and social networks

903
00:56:48,955 --> 00:56:52,095
Speaker 4:  and everything else. Podcasts interestingly

904
00:56:52,805 --> 00:56:56,615
Speaker 4:  hanging in there, doing fairly well and are like more popular in the US

905
00:56:56,615 --> 00:57:00,455
Speaker 4:  than almost anywhere else as a news source. But again, like TV news

906
00:57:01,065 --> 00:57:01,415
Speaker 4:  dying.

907
00:57:01,965 --> 00:57:05,335
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I mean this, this makes a lot of sense, right? Like the, the in the

908
00:57:05,335 --> 00:57:07,695
Speaker 5:  old days. In the old days, right, but

909
00:57:08,075 --> 00:57:08,295
Speaker 4:  Old

910
00:57:08,295 --> 00:57:09,495
Speaker 5:  Days, couple days of in the old days,

911
00:57:09,495 --> 00:57:10,495
Speaker 4:  Eight years ago in the

912
00:57:10,495 --> 00:57:13,815
Speaker 5:  Late years, no, but like right, it was a real thing. Like the evening news

913
00:57:13,835 --> 00:57:17,335
Speaker 5:  was on, you had to have it on if you wanted to know what, right. That was

914
00:57:17,335 --> 00:57:19,655
Speaker 5:  also when they showed the weather, if you wanted to know what the weather.

915
00:57:19,655 --> 00:57:22,255
Speaker 5:  Right. These things become increasingly less essential.

916
00:57:24,185 --> 00:57:27,875
Speaker 5:  It's funny, like, you know, I don't know at what point in time

917
00:57:28,235 --> 00:57:31,355
Speaker 5:  I would've been like, like goodness. Like

918
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:36,075
Speaker 5:  you're, you're Ewing the great television news

919
00:57:36,415 --> 00:57:39,035
Speaker 5:  in favor of some, for sure. Right, right. Like

920
00:57:39,435 --> 00:57:41,995
Speaker 4:  I don I don know this is a commentary on quality, by

921
00:57:41,995 --> 00:57:43,515
Speaker 5:  The way, but it, it is certainly, you know,

922
00:57:45,235 --> 00:57:48,675
Speaker 5:  I, the the rise of, I I think like social video

923
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:52,995
Speaker 5:  news, like that kind of maybe spells out where some of this viewership is

924
00:57:52,995 --> 00:57:54,235
Speaker 5:  going, right? Like Yep.

925
00:57:55,375 --> 00:57:59,275
Speaker 4:  And a lot of it is, it's super, super creator based in a way that is,

926
00:57:59,335 --> 00:58:03,275
Speaker 4:  is very different from the sort of like giant networks that were

927
00:58:03,375 --> 00:58:07,355
Speaker 4:  around for the last generation. Like the whole way people experience

928
00:58:07,355 --> 00:58:09,995
Speaker 4:  this stuff has just changed. Well

929
00:58:09,995 --> 00:58:12,875
Speaker 5:  That's, I actually, I have so many questions And I would love to know when

930
00:58:13,155 --> 00:58:16,595
Speaker 5:  somebody says yes, I get most of my news from TikTok, like, what does that

931
00:58:16,595 --> 00:58:20,035
Speaker 5:  mean to them? Right? Like, does that mean that they caught a, a

932
00:58:20,215 --> 00:58:23,955
Speaker 5:  ten second snippet of a podcast where somebody goes, you know, they just

933
00:58:23,955 --> 00:58:27,835
Speaker 5:  passed the Genius Act and that's gonna regulate stable

934
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:31,275
Speaker 5:  coins and then they just like swipe up. Like is that, is that the thing?

935
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:31,955
Speaker 5:  Is it somebody,

936
00:58:32,255 --> 00:58:34,275
Speaker 4:  Can I tell you a fact that's gonna really bum you out?

937
00:58:34,655 --> 00:58:35,555
Speaker 5:  Oh no. Would

938
00:58:35,555 --> 00:58:39,315
Speaker 4:  You like to hear a list of some of the podcasts that people said

939
00:58:39,385 --> 00:58:43,315
Speaker 4:  they turned to for news? Yeah. Would you like to know the most popular?

940
00:58:43,615 --> 00:58:47,525
Speaker 4:  Is it us? No, it's the Joe Rogan experience, not, which I think

941
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:49,485
Speaker 4:  fairly neatly answers your question. Right? Okay. Like,

942
00:58:49,715 --> 00:58:50,805
Speaker 5:  Yeah, we, there is

943
00:58:50,805 --> 00:58:54,405
Speaker 4:  Also this giant change in what people perceive to be news.

944
00:58:54,425 --> 00:58:58,405
Speaker 4:  That's, news used to be like a a a sort of put

945
00:58:58,605 --> 00:59:02,205
Speaker 4:  together report of some kind and you would watch it at

946
00:59:02,225 --> 00:59:05,565
Speaker 4:  6:00 PM and that's what the news was. And then the news was like,

947
00:59:06,205 --> 00:59:10,085
Speaker 4:  I don't know, stuff on Twitter and New York times.com and now news

948
00:59:10,225 --> 00:59:13,885
Speaker 4:  is something else. And I feel like I can't even exactly

949
00:59:14,285 --> 00:59:18,085
Speaker 4:  describe what it is, but it is very clear that like, if you think, if you're

950
00:59:18,085 --> 00:59:20,645
Speaker 4:  sitting there being like, I get most of my news from the Joe Rogan experience

951
00:59:20,675 --> 00:59:24,005
Speaker 4:  that is like a fundamentally different understanding of how to move through

952
00:59:24,005 --> 00:59:26,485
Speaker 4:  the world than I am like fully capable of recording

953
00:59:26,485 --> 00:59:30,325
Speaker 5:  With it. It's so interesting. It's like, I mean, I, going to the

954
00:59:30,325 --> 00:59:33,725
Speaker 5:  New York Times in some ways feels like the same audience who like likes to

955
00:59:33,725 --> 00:59:36,285
Speaker 5:  play chess and like, like, don't get me wrong, like that's me, right? But

956
00:59:36,285 --> 00:59:40,165
Speaker 5:  it's like, yeah, sure. Like, yo, you could play sellers ofan, like the,

957
00:59:40,265 --> 00:59:43,685
Speaker 5:  you could play Fortnite. Those would be more fun.

958
00:59:44,725 --> 00:59:46,725
Speaker 4:  I get all my news from Fortnite, Jake, I should say

959
00:59:46,725 --> 00:59:49,925
Speaker 5:  That, right? And it's like, like, you know, sure you could go to the New York

960
00:59:49,925 --> 00:59:53,805
Speaker 5:  Times and, and it will have great reporting and you'll get things in a

961
00:59:53,805 --> 00:59:57,685
Speaker 5:  timely manner and it'll be accurate. Or you

962
00:59:57,965 --> 01:00:01,405
Speaker 5:  can hear a version of it. And I'm putting version in like

963
01:00:01,875 --> 01:00:05,645
Speaker 5:  very serious like air quotes there on Joe Rogan like

964
01:00:05,645 --> 01:00:09,565
Speaker 5:  some amount of time later. And I think that that makes a lot of sense to

965
01:00:09,565 --> 01:00:13,285
Speaker 5:  me, right? Like news just becomes entertainment, right? You, you, you are

966
01:00:13,285 --> 01:00:16,885
Speaker 5:  not seeking out news, you are seeking out entertainment

967
01:00:17,145 --> 01:00:20,965
Speaker 5:  and you happen to find out things about what is happening as a result.

968
01:00:22,025 --> 01:00:25,565
Speaker 5:  The problem with it being entertainment is that it is not always accurate.

969
01:00:26,585 --> 01:00:29,765
Speaker 5:  You know, listen, this is like a podcast we're chatting, but we also, like,

970
01:00:29,785 --> 01:00:33,765
Speaker 5:  we uphold the same like rigorous standards as, as we do on the

971
01:00:33,845 --> 01:00:37,645
Speaker 5:  verges website. Every single thing we're saying we are making sure is

972
01:00:37,805 --> 01:00:37,925
Speaker 5:  accurate

973
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:40,725
Speaker 4:  Here. I have never been wrong on The Vergecast before ever.

974
01:00:41,125 --> 01:00:44,485
Speaker 5:  Listen, our takes our takes no promises there.

975
01:00:45,305 --> 01:00:49,085
Speaker 5:  But you know, this makes a lot of sense, right? And I think like, to to,

976
01:00:49,185 --> 01:00:53,165
Speaker 5:  to go back to your arguing about tv, it's like yeah, people are looking for

977
01:00:53,165 --> 01:00:56,805
Speaker 5:  the more entertaining and engaging experiences and TV

978
01:00:57,465 --> 01:01:01,085
Speaker 5:  in a lot of like, number one it's, it's, it's old, it's inconvenient.

979
01:01:01,505 --> 01:01:05,245
Speaker 5:  It is also just like, it is work in a way that flipping

980
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:07,725
Speaker 5:  through TikTok is actually like pretty fun. Yeah,

981
01:01:07,985 --> 01:01:11,805
Speaker 4:  No, it just, it makes me think of like, do you remember that phase

982
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:16,165
Speaker 4:  when Facebook went from like a, a thing that

983
01:01:16,165 --> 01:01:20,125
Speaker 4:  young people did and then all of a sudden it felt like in, in the span

984
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:23,685
Speaker 4:  of a week everybody's parents joined Facebook. Yeah. Like, do, do you remember

985
01:01:23,685 --> 01:01:27,365
Speaker 4:  that moment where all of a sudden everyone was on, you could just assume

986
01:01:27,375 --> 01:01:31,045
Speaker 4:  other people had Facebook. That's kind of what it feels like we're going

987
01:01:31,045 --> 01:01:34,685
Speaker 4:  through right now with a lot of this stuff where it's like none of these

988
01:01:34,685 --> 01:01:38,085
Speaker 4:  trends are surprising. Like you're saying, like, this has been happening.

989
01:01:38,085 --> 01:01:42,045
Speaker 4:  We've been talking about it, but the speed at which it happened

990
01:01:42,385 --> 01:01:45,525
Speaker 4:  and then this sort of immediate flip to like,

991
01:01:46,115 --> 01:01:49,365
Speaker 4:  just everybody's on TikTok now. It's not like every

992
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:53,765
Speaker 4:  your, your parents are on TikTok now. God, I hope my parents are not

993
01:01:53,765 --> 01:01:57,565
Speaker 4:  on TikTok now, but like many people's parents are on TikTok now. And

994
01:01:57,905 --> 01:02:01,685
Speaker 4:  the, that, that thing has just happened. Like the shift

995
01:02:01,745 --> 01:02:05,565
Speaker 4:  is done and it, it will keep growing. But whatever inflection point

996
01:02:05,565 --> 01:02:06,645
Speaker 4:  we have been looking for

997
01:02:08,525 --> 01:02:11,885
Speaker 4:  happened, like, it, it, it, it inflected. Yes. And I think

998
01:02:12,505 --> 01:02:16,205
Speaker 4:  now we're just gonna have to like, there's going to be so many downstream

999
01:02:16,205 --> 01:02:19,965
Speaker 4:  effects of all of that. Even like the, the way that these

1000
01:02:20,495 --> 01:02:24,405
Speaker 4:  giant news organizations that are used to vast amounts of

1001
01:02:24,405 --> 01:02:27,245
Speaker 4:  money being thrown off by their cable news networks, that's gonna change.

1002
01:02:27,245 --> 01:02:29,765
Speaker 4:  They're gonna start thinking differently about how these platforms work.

1003
01:02:29,765 --> 01:02:32,965
Speaker 4:  That's already been happening, but it's only gonna accelerate. Like all of

1004
01:02:32,965 --> 01:02:33,605
Speaker 4:  this stuff is gonna change.

1005
01:02:33,645 --> 01:02:37,485
Speaker 5:  I mean, it's interesting, like news was the flagship program on a

1006
01:02:37,645 --> 01:02:41,245
Speaker 5:  lot of these big broadcast networks, right? Yeah. Like this was the primetime

1007
01:02:41,355 --> 01:02:45,205
Speaker 5:  show. It happened like around dinnertime or right after dinnertime, so you

1008
01:02:45,205 --> 01:02:47,925
Speaker 5:  could all watch it together, said it was there when you got home from work.

1009
01:02:48,115 --> 01:02:51,645
Speaker 4:  Well, and then the next generation was 24 hour cable news was like the killer

1010
01:02:51,645 --> 01:02:53,245
Speaker 4:  app of cable news, right? It was cable.

1011
01:02:53,675 --> 01:02:57,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And you look at Netflix, how many news shows do they have?

1012
01:02:58,385 --> 01:03:01,355
Speaker 4:  There's like John Lenney's show is like the closest thing

1013
01:03:01,355 --> 01:03:05,035
Speaker 5:  They have. Yeah, yeah. Right. Like it it is just so interesting that news

1014
01:03:05,035 --> 01:03:08,555
Speaker 5:  is just not a programming category that, that people are bothering with.

1015
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:11,795
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah. It's, I I don't know what to make of any of this. And I think

1016
01:03:12,235 --> 01:03:15,875
Speaker 4:  I, like you said earlier, none of this is a statement of quality. There's

1017
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:19,675
Speaker 4:  a lot of trash on tv, there's a lot of bad news on tv,

1018
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:23,955
Speaker 4:  but it is like, it is different now. And it, and it, and it, it happened

1019
01:03:23,955 --> 01:03:27,755
Speaker 4:  more quickly I think than anybody expected it to. Yeah. And we're like,

1020
01:03:29,145 --> 01:03:32,795
Speaker 4:  it's all gonna get faster from here. I think like I just, I I remember talking

1021
01:03:32,795 --> 01:03:36,395
Speaker 4:  to folks for this YouTube story that I was writing and one of the things

1022
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:40,355
Speaker 4:  they said was that when YouTube hit the top of the

1023
01:03:40,355 --> 01:03:44,235
Speaker 4:  Nielsen gauge when it first was on the Nielsen gauge, and it was like sort

1024
01:03:44,235 --> 01:03:47,355
Speaker 4:  of apples to apples how big it was as a TV streaming platform,

1025
01:03:48,065 --> 01:03:51,835
Speaker 4:  YouTube's entire business shifted because all of a sudden everybody saw it

1026
01:03:51,835 --> 01:03:55,795
Speaker 4:  differently. Right? And that is like, it, it can happen that fast. These

1027
01:03:55,795 --> 01:03:59,075
Speaker 4:  people look at these things and they go, oh, this one is winning and this

1028
01:03:59,075 --> 01:04:02,475
Speaker 4:  one is losing, we're gonna go on the winning team. And it just, that's how

1029
01:04:02,475 --> 01:04:02,995
Speaker 4:  it spirals.

1030
01:04:03,185 --> 01:04:07,035
Speaker 5:  It's also really funny how much this, all this, like we, this whole

1031
01:04:07,035 --> 01:04:10,435
Speaker 5:  streaming thing started as a way to get away from ads and commercials

1032
01:04:11,175 --> 01:04:14,355
Speaker 5:  and actually it's all just looped back around. And the thing that is driving

1033
01:04:14,415 --> 01:04:18,155
Speaker 5:  it is that the ad dollars are now in streaming. Yeah. Everybody's

1034
01:04:18,305 --> 01:04:19,595
Speaker 5:  rushing their 'cause that's where it is.

1035
01:04:21,205 --> 01:04:21,955
Speaker 5:  Can't escape it.

1036
01:04:22,355 --> 01:04:24,755
Speaker 4:  No, this is just what we do here. Okay, wait, a couple more streaming things

1037
01:04:25,075 --> 01:04:28,955
Speaker 4:  and then we should take a break. One, I think we just need to take

1038
01:04:28,955 --> 01:04:32,915
Speaker 4:  like a very brief victory lap because Max or

1039
01:04:32,915 --> 01:04:36,755
Speaker 4:  Warner Brothers Discovery announced this week that when you go into

1040
01:04:36,755 --> 01:04:40,595
Speaker 4:  the Max app, which is not yet called HBO Max again, but will be soon.

1041
01:04:41,155 --> 01:04:43,995
Speaker 4:  Every time I open the app on my tv, I'm like waiting for it to change. And

1042
01:04:43,995 --> 01:04:47,355
Speaker 4:  it's gonna be such a joyful moment when it switches to HBO Max. I'm gonna

1043
01:04:47,355 --> 01:04:51,155
Speaker 4:  laugh hysterically. But anyway, now they're, they're

1044
01:04:51,155 --> 01:04:54,275
Speaker 4:  doing AI video previews and they're actually going to be

1045
01:04:54,815 --> 01:04:58,675
Speaker 4:  mining platform data to figure out which parts of a show or

1046
01:04:58,675 --> 01:05:02,315
Speaker 4:  movie they should show you in the preview in order to make you more likely

1047
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:05,875
Speaker 4:  to watch it. And this is an idea that we had on The Verge. We, we

1048
01:05:06,275 --> 01:05:10,155
Speaker 4:  invented this on The Vergecast and no one can convince me otherwise. I

1049
01:05:10,155 --> 01:05:12,035
Speaker 4:  don't remember what it was, but I'll find it because

1050
01:05:12,055 --> 01:05:15,835
Speaker 5:  We did. I cannot wait until they start showing the twist at the

1051
01:05:15,855 --> 01:05:19,645
Speaker 5:  climax of movies. And people, you know, are just

1052
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:21,445
Speaker 5:  like, what the heck you guys,

1053
01:05:21,745 --> 01:05:24,165
Speaker 4:  Do you ever do the thing on YouTube where like it has the, it has the little

1054
01:05:24,325 --> 01:05:26,565
Speaker 4:  graph of how much people play it and you tell, and you just skip right to

1055
01:05:26,565 --> 01:05:27,445
Speaker 4:  the most replayed bit.

1056
01:05:27,685 --> 01:05:31,125
Speaker 5:  I only do that on YouTube that like, why would you click anywhere else? Of

1057
01:05:31,125 --> 01:05:31,245
Speaker 5:  course,

1058
01:05:32,555 --> 01:05:35,045
Speaker 4:  It's just, you go to the sixth sense, you just, I'm,

1059
01:05:35,045 --> 01:05:35,885
Speaker 5:  It was, it's

1060
01:05:35,985 --> 01:05:36,725
Speaker 4:  He was dead the time.

1061
01:05:36,755 --> 01:05:40,245
Speaker 5:  This is what I needed. Yeah, like that. Of course. It's why like, oh, this

1062
01:05:40,245 --> 01:05:40,885
Speaker 5:  sounded intriguing.

1063
01:05:42,115 --> 01:05:45,805
Speaker 4:  Yeah. The the AI is going to be both right and horribly, horribly wrong.

1064
01:05:48,185 --> 01:05:52,125
Speaker 4:  And then the other one is the, the, we're gonna talk

1065
01:05:52,205 --> 01:05:55,365
Speaker 4:  a bunch about meta in the lightning round. 'cause a really fascinating set

1066
01:05:55,365 --> 01:05:59,045
Speaker 4:  of meta news this week. But the, the streaming thing that it did this week

1067
01:05:59,265 --> 01:06:03,085
Speaker 4:  was basically rename and rebrand

1068
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:07,085
Speaker 4:  all of the video on all of Meta's products, particularly on Facebook

1069
01:06:07,545 --> 01:06:09,285
Speaker 4:  as reels. Okay. And so,

1070
01:06:09,625 --> 01:06:13,525
Speaker 5:  Oh my god, me and Barbara Krasnoff on our team tried

1071
01:06:13,525 --> 01:06:16,405
Speaker 5:  to get to the bottom of this a few months ago. We were trying to figure out

1072
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:20,125
Speaker 5:  like the different video products and what happened. You put, and

1073
01:06:20,365 --> 01:06:24,325
Speaker 5:  Facebook had at least three different video products. Oh my God. And I

1074
01:06:24,325 --> 01:06:28,245
Speaker 5:  wanna be clear, they looked the same, they worked the same, they

1075
01:06:28,245 --> 01:06:32,165
Speaker 5:  were accessible through the same apps. They were just in different places.

1076
01:06:32,785 --> 01:06:36,245
Speaker 5:  And we emailed them And I believe they were like, yeah,

1077
01:06:36,875 --> 01:06:40,725
Speaker 5:  some of them will play content from the others and others won't play content

1078
01:06:40,755 --> 01:06:43,325
Speaker 5:  from the others. And so there's sort of different silos, but they're not

1079
01:06:43,325 --> 01:06:43,845
Speaker 5:  different silo.

1080
01:06:44,075 --> 01:06:48,035
Speaker 4:  Jake, are you saying we deserve credit for this too? Did we do this when

1081
01:06:48,035 --> 01:06:51,075
Speaker 4:  you emailed Meta? Were somebody sent that to Mark and he was like, that's

1082
01:06:51,075 --> 01:06:52,275
Speaker 4:  a good idea, Jake, I should do that.

1083
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:56,635
Speaker 5:  I, I'm not sure, I'm not sure what was ever happening over there. I

1084
01:06:56,635 --> 01:06:59,475
Speaker 5:  don't know how they were operating this, it, it,

1085
01:07:01,375 --> 01:07:05,165
Speaker 5:  it was the most confusing way to operate three video

1086
01:07:05,485 --> 01:07:09,045
Speaker 5:  services. Yes. I guess, I don't know. I don't know how this emerged. And

1087
01:07:09,045 --> 01:07:12,525
Speaker 5:  so yes, finally here's the thing. It like

1088
01:07:13,665 --> 01:07:17,445
Speaker 5:  on one level Facebook says all video is now reels. It's like,

1089
01:07:17,585 --> 01:07:21,445
Speaker 5:  oh man. But on the other it's like, no. Like, actually, actually

1090
01:07:21,445 --> 01:07:25,205
Speaker 5:  this is like so much more sensible Yes. Than what they were doing

1091
01:07:25,205 --> 01:07:28,365
Speaker 5:  beforehand. That I'm actually like, thank goodness, like

1092
01:07:29,605 --> 01:07:33,365
Speaker 5:  EE even if this means the real situation might be worse because it's gonna

1093
01:07:33,365 --> 01:07:36,925
Speaker 5:  be flooded with more stuff. It's like it was way too complicated beforehand.

1094
01:07:37,465 --> 01:07:40,285
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah. I think, I think the, the most

1095
01:07:40,995 --> 01:07:44,845
Speaker 4:  problematic outcome of this is I think it makes very clear that

1096
01:07:45,245 --> 01:07:48,045
Speaker 4:  Facebook's future is just as a video player

1097
01:07:49,275 --> 01:07:53,205
Speaker 4:  that seriously, like I think Facebook is going to be, it's gonna be

1098
01:07:53,205 --> 01:07:56,445
Speaker 4:  groups, it's gonna be Marketplace, and it's gonna be a video player. And,

1099
01:07:56,505 --> 01:07:59,965
Speaker 4:  And I think the idea of Facebook as like the

1100
01:08:00,205 --> 01:08:03,685
Speaker 4:  repository for all of the video created elsewhere on Meta

1101
01:08:03,925 --> 01:08:07,805
Speaker 4:  properties is their best idea about how to bring people

1102
01:08:07,805 --> 01:08:08,565
Speaker 4:  back to Facebook.

1103
01:08:10,315 --> 01:08:13,565
Speaker 4:  Will it work? I don't know, but I think, I think that is pretty clearly where

1104
01:08:13,565 --> 01:08:17,085
Speaker 4:  we're headed. And this gives them a way to just like pour everything back

1105
01:08:17,115 --> 01:08:21,045
Speaker 4:  into Facebook. Because again, Facebook is very important to

1106
01:08:21,045 --> 01:08:24,245
Speaker 4:  Mark Zuckerberg in a way that I don't think any of the other products are.

1107
01:08:24,665 --> 01:08:28,405
Speaker 4:  And they will do everything they can to get people opening the Facebook app

1108
01:08:28,465 --> 01:08:32,325
Speaker 4:  as often as possible. Just one other thought on this is I think it's

1109
01:08:32,325 --> 01:08:35,565
Speaker 4:  very important to Facebook and to meta

1110
01:08:36,225 --> 01:08:40,045
Speaker 4:  at large to be competitive as a video platform. And

1111
01:08:40,835 --> 01:08:44,485
Speaker 4:  I've, I've written about this a bunch, but like anything you can do

1112
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:48,245
Speaker 4:  to juice view counts, you will do. And so for meta

1113
01:08:48,505 --> 01:08:51,965
Speaker 4:  to take all of these disparate video platforms and just roll them into one

1114
01:08:52,505 --> 01:08:55,845
Speaker 4:  is going to make all of the numbers look bigger and is gonna make it a much

1115
01:08:55,845 --> 01:08:59,285
Speaker 4:  more compelling appearing creator platform, it's gonna make it seem like

1116
01:08:59,285 --> 01:09:02,925
Speaker 4:  reach is much bigger. And so, like one of the things Mark Zuckerberg has

1117
01:09:02,925 --> 01:09:06,885
Speaker 4:  been saying is he wants Facebook to be culturally relevant. Again, I

1118
01:09:06,885 --> 01:09:10,725
Speaker 4:  think that might be impossible, but I think you can juice video numbers

1119
01:09:11,225 --> 01:09:15,165
Speaker 4:  in a such a way that will suggest cultural relevance and that might be

1120
01:09:15,165 --> 01:09:17,085
Speaker 4:  all you need. If the goal is to just make a lot of money.

1121
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:21,565
Speaker 5:  Thi this tracks me. I think I'm, maybe I'm underestimating them. I'm

1122
01:09:21,565 --> 01:09:25,165
Speaker 5:  not convinced this will necessarily work in a, at least in a good quality

1123
01:09:25,265 --> 01:09:28,925
Speaker 5:  way. But I I I think this actually loops all the way

1124
01:09:29,045 --> 01:09:32,325
Speaker 5:  back to the YouTube TV stuff that we were talking about.

1125
01:09:33,825 --> 01:09:37,525
Speaker 5:  Do you want to juice engagement? Do you wanna juice time

1126
01:09:37,615 --> 01:09:41,415
Speaker 5:  spent? Have people watch videos all day, right?

1127
01:09:41,495 --> 01:09:44,855
Speaker 5:  A hundred percent. YouTube, they change their algorithm to promote longer

1128
01:09:44,855 --> 01:09:48,815
Speaker 5:  videos. Okay, great. Now the videos are longer, now they're

1129
01:09:48,815 --> 01:09:52,295
Speaker 5:  better on tv now people are watching more YouTube on tv. You should make

1130
01:09:52,295 --> 01:09:54,175
Speaker 5:  your videos even longer 'cause people are sitting back

1131
01:13:13,335 --> 01:13:16,075
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back. It's time for the lightning round.

1132
01:13:39,105 --> 01:13:42,715
Speaker 4:  Alright, so since NE's not here, we're going to, we're going to

1133
01:13:42,945 --> 01:13:46,315
Speaker 4:  skip Brendan Carr as a dummy for a week. We're gonna give Brendan two weeks

1134
01:13:46,335 --> 01:13:50,275
Speaker 4:  to be a dummy. But there is one tiny bit of news that is

1135
01:13:50,275 --> 01:13:54,195
Speaker 4:  related to our man, man, Brendan, that we should just, we should just

1136
01:13:54,195 --> 01:13:57,315
Speaker 4:  mention very briefly, which is that the Senate confirmed Olivia Trusty

1137
01:13:58,295 --> 01:14:02,155
Speaker 4:  who was Trump's pick to be the new commissioner of the

1138
01:14:02,155 --> 01:14:05,195
Speaker 4:  FCC. The vote was, let's see, 53 to 45.

1139
01:14:06,215 --> 01:14:09,795
Speaker 4:  And now this means there are three people on the FCC

1140
01:14:10,025 --> 01:14:13,885
Speaker 4:  instead of two and kind of just one because Anna Gomez is just like

1141
01:14:13,885 --> 01:14:16,685
Speaker 4:  running around telling everybody that Brendan Carr is a monster and waiting

1142
01:14:16,685 --> 01:14:17,205
Speaker 4:  to get fired.

1143
01:14:19,575 --> 01:14:22,255
Speaker 4:  Hooray, great job everybody. Good government. Yeah,

1144
01:14:22,645 --> 01:14:26,375
Speaker 5:  This actually has a big impact, right? There is now a quorum again, right,

1145
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:30,015
Speaker 5:  because before they fired too many people and So there just

1146
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:33,815
Speaker 5:  weren't enough people for the FCC to actually officially legally get things

1147
01:14:33,815 --> 01:14:37,655
Speaker 5:  done. Right now there's three of them. Now they can, this

1148
01:14:37,655 --> 01:14:39,975
Speaker 5:  is sort of, this is like a slightly weird process.

1149
01:14:41,255 --> 01:14:45,135
Speaker 5:  FCC commissioners are usually nominated and confirmed

1150
01:14:45,155 --> 01:14:49,055
Speaker 5:  in pairs. There's usually one Democrat and one Republican at the same time.

1151
01:14:49,375 --> 01:14:52,615
Speaker 5:  Interesting. Now maybe you can make the argument that, okay, there already

1152
01:14:52,675 --> 01:14:56,295
Speaker 5:  is Anna Gomez and, and there's an odd number. So

1153
01:14:56,515 --> 01:15:00,335
Speaker 5:  may maybe that's why I think some people are definitely a little worried

1154
01:15:00,425 --> 01:15:02,895
Speaker 5:  about the fact that they only did a Republican this time.

1155
01:15:04,475 --> 01:15:08,135
Speaker 5:  The the, this is actually like very strange to me, but the

1156
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:12,095
Speaker 5:  communications act, which which established FCC, it's a legal

1157
01:15:12,125 --> 01:15:15,415
Speaker 5:  requirement that there can only be three people

1158
01:15:16,195 --> 01:15:18,695
Speaker 5:  out of the five commissioners. Only three of them can be of the same party.

1159
01:15:20,325 --> 01:15:23,585
Speaker 5:  So that there is some limit to your ability to

1160
01:15:24,435 --> 01:15:28,305
Speaker 5:  stack the commission. That being said, could the other

1161
01:15:28,325 --> 01:15:32,265
Speaker 5:  two people be like the wig party? And I don't think anybody's tested that

1162
01:15:32,265 --> 01:15:35,905
Speaker 5:  yet. So we'll find out. But yes, now the FCC

1163
01:15:37,535 --> 01:15:38,185
Speaker 5:  back at it.

1164
01:15:38,415 --> 01:15:41,745
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I mean can can I just, can I just read you a quote

1165
01:15:42,135 --> 01:15:45,185
Speaker 4:  from our story, which I feel like just perfectly, it says all the things

1166
01:15:45,185 --> 01:15:49,065
Speaker 4:  that I would like to say much better than I would say them. So

1167
01:15:49,065 --> 01:15:53,025
Speaker 4:  Lauren Finer wrote a story for us about Olivia Trusty and the

1168
01:15:53,125 --> 01:15:56,705
Speaker 4:  the nomination process. The confirmation process. And

1169
01:15:57,005 --> 01:16:00,345
Speaker 4:  she got a quote from a guy named Matt Wood, who is the VP of policy and general

1170
01:16:00,345 --> 01:16:04,265
Speaker 4:  counsel of a nonpartisan group called Free Press Action. I'm just gonna read

1171
01:16:04,265 --> 01:16:07,265
Speaker 4:  you the whole quote and then we're gonna move on. He says, in normal times

1172
01:16:07,265 --> 01:16:09,825
Speaker 4:  there would be little reason to oppose the confirmation of a candidate as

1173
01:16:09,825 --> 01:16:13,025
Speaker 4:  qualified as trustee, but these are not normal times Trustee's confirmation

1174
01:16:13,025 --> 01:16:16,105
Speaker 4:  gives Carr the majority. He needs to radically reshape the media sector in

1175
01:16:16,105 --> 01:16:19,345
Speaker 4:  Trump's image, including offering policy favors to large broadcasters in

1176
01:16:19,505 --> 01:16:23,225
Speaker 4:  exchange for their unwavering loyalty to the president. I agree

1177
01:16:23,225 --> 01:16:27,025
Speaker 4:  with every single word of that and that seems

1178
01:16:27,025 --> 01:16:30,945
Speaker 4:  to be what is going on. Let's move on. We'll, we'll come back to this, you

1179
01:16:30,945 --> 01:16:31,225
Speaker 4:  know, we'll just

1180
01:16:31,455 --> 01:16:32,825
Speaker 5:  Just end on that light

1181
01:16:32,825 --> 01:16:36,265
Speaker 4:  Note. I just, yeah, Brenda Carr remains a dummy. We'll get back to this next

1182
01:16:36,265 --> 01:16:36,825
Speaker 4:  week and now an

1183
01:16:36,825 --> 01:16:37,345
Speaker 5:  Empowered one

1184
01:16:37,925 --> 01:16:40,065
Speaker 4:  Now, now a dummy with

1185
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:40,865
Speaker 5:  Feel good about

1186
01:16:40,865 --> 01:16:43,385
Speaker 4:  That. Yeah. Someone else who can sign the papers for him.

1187
01:16:44,935 --> 01:16:48,705
Speaker 4:  Next up we got a little tiny nugget

1188
01:16:48,965 --> 01:16:52,465
Speaker 4:  of maybe kind of new news about Siri.

1189
01:16:53,655 --> 01:16:57,145
Speaker 4:  Everybody is, everybody is doing the, the

1190
01:16:58,015 --> 01:17:01,025
Speaker 4:  developer beta stuff, liquid glass is bad.

1191
01:17:02,455 --> 01:17:06,385
Speaker 4:  They're out there doing more interviews about iPad os and we continue

1192
01:17:06,385 --> 01:17:09,765
Speaker 4:  to hear spring 2026 for better. Siri,

1193
01:17:11,195 --> 01:17:12,475
Speaker 4:  I just, I just wanna put that out there.

1194
01:17:12,585 --> 01:17:13,715
Speaker 5:  Okay. Do you buy

1195
01:17:13,715 --> 01:17:14,395
Speaker 4:  It? No,

1196
01:17:16,715 --> 01:17:20,435
Speaker 5:  I thought there'd be some equivocation there. Yeah, I don I don't either.

1197
01:17:20,765 --> 01:17:23,955
Speaker 5:  Right? Like se 2 20 26. That sounds like maybe an internal target.

1198
01:17:24,695 --> 01:17:27,915
Speaker 5:  It, it just, it also just seems very weird to me the idea that they would

1199
01:17:27,915 --> 01:17:31,675
Speaker 5:  drop such a major feature so late in operating systems

1200
01:17:31,675 --> 01:17:32,395
Speaker 5:  release cycle.

1201
01:17:34,475 --> 01:17:38,315
Speaker 4:  I, I think if, if you were to say, would I bet on

1202
01:17:38,705 --> 01:17:42,595
Speaker 4:  fall 2026 with like the next round of software, I would

1203
01:17:42,595 --> 01:17:46,315
Speaker 4:  say more likely because it seems

1204
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:49,795
Speaker 4:  possible to me that there's going to have, they will have had a lot of time

1205
01:17:49,795 --> 01:17:53,555
Speaker 4:  to do the work. They, they are going to ship some of the features, but not

1206
01:17:53,555 --> 01:17:57,395
Speaker 4:  all of them. Like, I think, I think it's possible developers will have

1207
01:17:57,395 --> 01:18:00,275
Speaker 4:  had another full year to do the app intent stuff that I think is gonna make

1208
01:18:00,275 --> 01:18:01,755
Speaker 4:  a lot of this stuff work. Like we talked about last week

1209
01:18:03,675 --> 01:18:07,065
Speaker 4:  maybe, maybe I would believe that. But I, I think you're right, the idea

1210
01:18:07,065 --> 01:18:10,665
Speaker 4:  that they would just like ship this thing in March

1211
01:18:10,845 --> 01:18:14,705
Speaker 4:  as a like 0.4 update does not, I don know just

1212
01:18:14,705 --> 01:18:16,185
Speaker 4:  doesn't pass the test for me. I don't buy

1213
01:18:16,185 --> 01:18:20,065
Speaker 5:  It. Neither do I. One thing that I think is also gonna be really tricky

1214
01:18:20,065 --> 01:18:23,865
Speaker 5:  for Apple going forward is, you know, they, they have been

1215
01:18:23,985 --> 01:18:26,985
Speaker 5:  breaking from this a little bit, but traditionally they, they release software

1216
01:18:27,055 --> 01:18:30,545
Speaker 5:  once a year, right? And they have some small updates here and there and,

1217
01:18:30,545 --> 01:18:32,785
Speaker 5:  and that, that has been breaking, that has been breaking a little bit where

1218
01:18:32,785 --> 01:18:35,385
Speaker 5:  they'll, they'll do like, you know, a little bit of an update in the fall,

1219
01:18:35,385 --> 01:18:37,825
Speaker 5:  maybe a little bit in the spring. But basically it all comes once a year.

1220
01:18:38,405 --> 01:18:42,225
Speaker 5:  And I think for the AI world in particular, which is

1221
01:18:42,225 --> 01:18:46,105
Speaker 5:  moving so fast and which is seeing like some really

1222
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:50,545
Speaker 5:  material leaps from release to release where it's like, it, something can

1223
01:18:50,545 --> 01:18:54,345
Speaker 5:  go from like, oh, AI can never do that. It's so broken to like, oh, it can

1224
01:18:54,345 --> 01:18:58,225
Speaker 5:  like kind of do that. Which to be clear is, is meaningful

1225
01:18:59,165 --> 01:19:03,065
Speaker 5:  in a, in a couple months time. Like Apple really puts itself at

1226
01:19:03,145 --> 01:19:07,055
Speaker 5:  a pretty big disa like set aside that they

1227
01:19:07,055 --> 01:19:10,375
Speaker 5:  have to just make Siri work, which apparently is a, a monumental task,

1228
01:19:11,545 --> 01:19:15,455
Speaker 5:  right? Just being able to keep up with all the other, you know,

1229
01:19:15,915 --> 01:19:19,575
Speaker 5:  AI players. They, they're putting themselves at a really big disadvantage

1230
01:19:19,765 --> 01:19:23,375
Speaker 5:  with the way that they make their products and ship so infrequently.

1231
01:19:23,715 --> 01:19:27,655
Speaker 5:  So I, I look forward to seeing if they can meet this, you

1232
01:19:27,655 --> 01:19:31,415
Speaker 5:  know, reported internal date. I suspect, I suspect later in

1233
01:19:31,415 --> 01:19:35,295
Speaker 5:  2026 feels more likely to me just given how much they've been

1234
01:19:35,295 --> 01:19:36,055
Speaker 5:  struggling so far.

1235
01:19:36,695 --> 01:19:39,935
Speaker 4:  I was talking to somebody the other day about all of this and

1236
01:19:40,515 --> 01:19:43,775
Speaker 4:  people have been throwing out the, you know, they, they should just kill

1237
01:19:43,775 --> 01:19:47,655
Speaker 4:  the Siri brand thing for a while And I

1238
01:19:47,655 --> 01:19:50,095
Speaker 4:  just asked somebody, I was like, well would you know you're a product person,

1239
01:19:50,095 --> 01:19:53,975
Speaker 4:  would you get rid of the Siri brand and what would you rebrand it to? And

1240
01:19:53,975 --> 01:19:57,855
Speaker 4:  they were like, dude, spotlight, it's sitting right there. People like Spotlight.

1241
01:19:58,075 --> 01:20:01,215
Speaker 4:  People know what it is. People understand how it works. It's not trying to

1242
01:20:01,215 --> 01:20:04,095
Speaker 4:  do everything, but it is trying to do all the things that people actually

1243
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:07,925
Speaker 4:  want. Just call it Spotlight. Like you don't even have to retire Siri, just

1244
01:20:07,925 --> 01:20:11,485
Speaker 4:  keep adding features to Spotlight. Yes. And I was like, oh my God, that's

1245
01:20:11,485 --> 01:20:15,245
Speaker 4:  it. Like I, I I don't think that's gonna happen, but I kind of think that

1246
01:20:15,425 --> 01:20:18,845
Speaker 4:  is a brilliant idea that I wish I had had. I love it on my own. Alright,

1247
01:20:19,075 --> 01:20:22,925
Speaker 4:  next up. Some news that caused some

1248
01:20:22,925 --> 01:20:26,805
Speaker 4:  surprising amount of both consternation and funny jokes on the

1249
01:20:26,965 --> 01:20:30,645
Speaker 4:  internet this week. WhatsApp is officially getting

1250
01:20:31,185 --> 01:20:35,045
Speaker 4:  ads, ads, ads are coming to, let's see if I

1251
01:20:35,245 --> 01:20:39,165
Speaker 4:  remember this correctly. There are gonna be ads in the, the status sort of

1252
01:20:39,255 --> 01:20:42,485
Speaker 4:  story screens that I sincerely believe no one ever looks at.

1253
01:20:43,125 --> 01:20:46,925
Speaker 4:  There are gonna be promoted channels in the channels interface, which

1254
01:20:47,685 --> 01:20:50,485
Speaker 4:  I think is actually growing pretty fast from what I hear. Channels have actually

1255
01:20:50,485 --> 01:20:54,445
Speaker 4:  been a pretty big hit, especially globally. So notably the place

1256
01:20:54,445 --> 01:20:56,765
Speaker 4:  that ads are not is in your chats,

1257
01:20:58,465 --> 01:21:02,415
Speaker 4:  but this feels to me like maybe not the beginning of the end

1258
01:21:02,575 --> 01:21:05,615
Speaker 4:  of WhatsApp, but the beginning of a very different Whatsapp.

1259
01:21:06,085 --> 01:21:09,775
Speaker 5:  Well this is also right, like the, the founders famously

1260
01:21:09,775 --> 01:21:13,455
Speaker 5:  never wanted ads in the app and like look like

1261
01:21:13,565 --> 01:21:17,015
Speaker 5:  they had just watched Fight Club. They were like, kind of like on one and

1262
01:21:17,015 --> 01:21:20,535
Speaker 5:  they were like, ads are the death of humanity. Like, it was like a little

1263
01:21:21,095 --> 01:21:24,735
Speaker 5:  dramatic and like it's, it's, you know, ads bring us a lot of free stuff.

1264
01:21:24,805 --> 01:21:28,735
Speaker 5:  It's all right. But it is true, right? I I think they did like,

1265
01:21:28,735 --> 01:21:32,455
Speaker 5:  they did have a pretty singular point, which is that like that a a

1266
01:21:32,615 --> 01:21:36,455
Speaker 5:  a chat app is really intimate and personal. These are all of your friends,

1267
01:21:36,455 --> 01:21:39,855
Speaker 5:  they're people, you know and care about. Having ads

1268
01:21:39,935 --> 01:21:43,855
Speaker 5:  inserted between that is actually pretty disruptive. It's jarring,

1269
01:21:43,855 --> 01:21:47,615
Speaker 5:  it changes the experience in a material way. And while Meta has

1270
01:21:47,675 --> 01:21:51,575
Speaker 5:  not yet, you know, gone and done that, you know, it's

1271
01:21:51,655 --> 01:21:53,815
Speaker 5:  starting, it's happening. They went, Hey, we need to make some more money

1272
01:21:53,815 --> 01:21:57,455
Speaker 5:  off Whatsapp. How are we gonna juice it? The obvious answer, it's ads,

1273
01:21:58,065 --> 01:22:01,735
Speaker 4:  Right? Yeah. I mean there was the business chat thing that I think has, has

1274
01:22:01,735 --> 01:22:05,575
Speaker 4:  turned into some of a business for Meta, but this is also like,

1275
01:22:06,125 --> 01:22:09,895
Speaker 4:  clearly this is the thing that Meta does best is ads at massive

1276
01:22:09,945 --> 01:22:13,895
Speaker 4:  scale. And this is also the thing that Meta is

1277
01:22:13,895 --> 01:22:16,695
Speaker 4:  best equipped to do from an advertising perspective, which is advertised

1278
01:22:16,695 --> 01:22:20,335
Speaker 4:  for businesses next to other businesses. Like that's, that's what Facebook

1279
01:22:20,335 --> 01:22:23,735
Speaker 4:  ads are. Yeah. Like this makes perfect sense to me from a

1280
01:22:24,165 --> 01:22:27,575
Speaker 4:  meta business perspective. Like of course this is what you would do and it

1281
01:22:27,575 --> 01:22:31,455
Speaker 4:  is probably the least intrusive thing they could have done

1282
01:22:31,475 --> 01:22:34,415
Speaker 4:  in Whatsapp, but that's a really

1283
01:22:35,205 --> 01:22:38,295
Speaker 4:  high bar, right? Like it's all pretty intrusive. And I think

1284
01:22:39,465 --> 01:22:43,175
Speaker 4:  there was an interesting thing that it, it had to note

1285
01:22:43,535 --> 01:22:46,815
Speaker 4:  explicitly, which is that it won't use your

1286
01:22:47,175 --> 01:22:51,015
Speaker 4:  messages or your information to inform and

1287
01:22:51,015 --> 01:22:54,855
Speaker 4:  and tune the ads. And this, this is the like perception

1288
01:22:54,855 --> 01:22:58,255
Speaker 4:  change that I think is so hard to do after the fact, which is come in and

1289
01:22:58,255 --> 01:23:02,245
Speaker 4:  say, yes, of course we've been reading all of your messages, but we're

1290
01:23:02,245 --> 01:23:05,885
Speaker 4:  not gonna do anything with them. And even though, like I actually, I have

1291
01:23:05,885 --> 01:23:09,605
Speaker 4:  no reason not to believe Meta's lines about encryption.

1292
01:23:10,175 --> 01:23:13,285
Speaker 4:  There are a million conspiracy theories out there, but if, if, if there has

1293
01:23:13,285 --> 01:23:17,245
Speaker 4:  been a proof that Whatsapp messages are not encrypted, I

1294
01:23:17,365 --> 01:23:21,205
Speaker 4:  I I have not seen it. So I will assume that they are, but you

1295
01:23:21,205 --> 01:23:25,165
Speaker 4:  don't, that that perception goes away quickly. This sense of like,

1296
01:23:25,205 --> 01:23:29,085
Speaker 4:  I am in an actually private place, which already became

1297
01:23:29,085 --> 01:23:31,805
Speaker 4:  harder for Whatsapp to do when it was bought by Meta A company that is not

1298
01:23:31,805 --> 01:23:34,405
Speaker 4:  famous for being a good citizen of your privacy

1299
01:23:35,865 --> 01:23:39,705
Speaker 4:  to then say there's ads here. But we

1300
01:23:39,705 --> 01:23:43,305
Speaker 4:  still don't, we we're not looking, we're just putting ads. It's just a constant

1301
01:23:43,545 --> 01:23:47,185
Speaker 4:  reminder of who is here with me in this place where I'm supposed to be able

1302
01:23:47,185 --> 01:23:47,905
Speaker 4:  to be by myself.

1303
01:23:48,125 --> 01:23:51,665
Speaker 5:  No, that's so real. Like e everybody thinks Facebook is like tapping their

1304
01:23:51,665 --> 01:23:55,545
Speaker 5:  microphone and it's, it's like they just know everything

1305
01:23:55,545 --> 01:23:58,065
Speaker 5:  else about you. Right? Right. They, they they don't need to reach. Yeah.

1306
01:23:58,065 --> 01:23:58,345
Speaker 5:  That probably

1307
01:23:58,345 --> 01:23:59,465
Speaker 4:  Doesn't have to read your Whatsapp.

1308
01:23:59,835 --> 01:24:02,465
Speaker 5:  Right? Right. They don't have to, they already, they already know this stuff

1309
01:24:02,525 --> 01:24:06,385
Speaker 5:  and, and now it's going to be very like abundantly clear how much they

1310
01:24:06,385 --> 01:24:06,905
Speaker 5:  know about you.

1311
01:24:07,535 --> 01:24:11,185
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah. I think it's, it's, it's pushing in this very

1312
01:24:11,425 --> 01:24:14,705
Speaker 4:  interesting like snapchatty kind of direction, which is very funny because

1313
01:24:15,495 --> 01:24:18,715
Speaker 4:  it just absolutely decimated Snapchat as a product, but they're trying to

1314
01:24:18,715 --> 01:24:22,595
Speaker 4:  do some Snapchat stuff. But the, the last thing

1315
01:24:22,595 --> 01:24:26,155
Speaker 4:  I wanna say on this before we move on is, is just genuine kudos

1316
01:24:26,695 --> 01:24:29,715
Speaker 4:  to Signal for immediately after this happened,

1317
01:24:30,735 --> 01:24:34,595
Speaker 4:  screenshotting the, the, an announcement of it and saying

1318
01:24:34,625 --> 01:24:38,355
Speaker 4:  this was Meredith Whitaker, the, the president of Signal who said,

1319
01:24:38,515 --> 01:24:42,395
Speaker 4:  use Signal. We promise no AI clutter, no surveillance ads, whatever the rest

1320
01:24:42,395 --> 01:24:45,155
Speaker 4:  of the industry does, we lead, we don't follow heart emoji.

1321
01:24:46,295 --> 01:24:50,035
Speaker 4:  Nailed it. No. Like it is very funny how,

1322
01:24:50,255 --> 01:24:53,915
Speaker 4:  how much signals marketing is just written for

1323
01:24:53,915 --> 01:24:57,555
Speaker 4:  itself and they just, every time they're like, oh look, somebody did a bad

1324
01:24:57,555 --> 01:25:00,155
Speaker 4:  thing, we won't do that Use signal. That's their whole marketing message

1325
01:25:00,475 --> 01:25:03,835
Speaker 4:  and it, it just keeps working and it's very funny And I enjoy it very much.

1326
01:25:03,865 --> 01:25:07,715
Speaker 4:  It's good. All right, couple more and then we should get out of here. There

1327
01:25:07,715 --> 01:25:11,315
Speaker 4:  was this interesting change while we're talking about ads to

1328
01:25:11,315 --> 01:25:14,475
Speaker 4:  Reddit this week that I found really fascinating. Did you, did you track

1329
01:25:14,475 --> 01:25:15,155
Speaker 4:  this at all?

1330
01:25:15,625 --> 01:25:16,835
Speaker 5:  What do you mean by track this?

1331
01:25:17,575 --> 01:25:20,555
Speaker 4:  Did you, did you pay attention to what Reddit is doing at all? Reddit ads

1332
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:23,475
Speaker 4:  are not required to be interesting to you, but I I am happy to explain it

1333
01:25:23,475 --> 01:25:24,075
Speaker 4:  to you if you'd like to

1334
01:25:24,095 --> 01:25:27,075
Speaker 5:  Not No, tell tell me, tell me. Yeah, whatever. So

1335
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:31,195
Speaker 4:  Reddit basically forever trying to grow as a business and has realized

1336
01:25:31,265 --> 01:25:35,155
Speaker 4:  that the best thing it has going for it is all of the posts and comments

1337
01:25:35,175 --> 01:25:38,915
Speaker 4:  on Reddit. So Reddit announced two things for advertisers this week.

1338
01:25:39,575 --> 01:25:42,835
Speaker 4:  One of them is that it will basically let you take

1339
01:25:43,455 --> 01:25:46,915
Speaker 4:  all of the insights and all of the information from all of Reddit and use

1340
01:25:46,915 --> 01:25:50,875
Speaker 4:  it to inform your ads, which is the sort of thing that is like, true on

1341
01:25:50,945 --> 01:25:54,915
Speaker 4:  lots of platforms. But is is again the kind of thing that Reddit went

1342
01:25:54,915 --> 01:25:57,875
Speaker 4:  out of its way to be like we are a user friendly and moderation friendly

1343
01:25:58,475 --> 01:26:02,355
Speaker 4:  platform. When in like Facebook was like, screw you, we sell ads based on

1344
01:26:02,355 --> 01:26:05,405
Speaker 4:  all your stuff. Reddit is just fully doing that. But the thing that I find

1345
01:26:05,405 --> 01:26:09,245
Speaker 4:  even wilder is that now if you're an advertiser, you

1346
01:26:09,245 --> 01:26:12,885
Speaker 4:  can have an ad on Reddit and then right underneath it

1347
01:26:13,185 --> 01:26:16,805
Speaker 4:  Reddit will, will dynamically the AI driven e

1348
01:26:17,495 --> 01:26:21,325
Speaker 4:  place positive Reddit posts about your product that

1349
01:26:21,525 --> 01:26:24,805
Speaker 4:  you're trying to advertise. So they will just find people who said nice things

1350
01:26:24,805 --> 01:26:28,485
Speaker 4:  about you on Reddit and just dump it right underneath your ad all over Reddit.

1351
01:26:28,715 --> 01:26:31,725
Speaker 5:  That feels, that feels weird. I I it's bad. It's interesting when, when I

1352
01:26:31,725 --> 01:26:35,535
Speaker 5:  saw the headline for this, I, I part of this feels genius

1353
01:26:35,675 --> 01:26:38,135
Speaker 5:  and part of this feels, feels really not good. Like

1354
01:26:40,895 --> 01:26:44,635
Speaker 5:  it makes sense to me if, if you know

1355
01:26:44,825 --> 01:26:47,915
Speaker 5:  your Mercedes and somebody's like, check on my sick Mercedes,

1356
01:26:48,885 --> 01:26:52,835
Speaker 5:  great. Like go promote that. That seems cool. And, and like, you know, maybe

1357
01:26:52,835 --> 01:26:56,635
Speaker 5:  that's a little weird if you're the guy who gets promoted, but just like

1358
01:26:56,705 --> 01:27:00,195
Speaker 5:  streaming a bunch of random comments from out of context that feels a, that

1359
01:27:00,195 --> 01:27:03,995
Speaker 5:  feels off and, And I feel like users are going

1360
01:27:04,015 --> 01:27:07,755
Speaker 5:  to feel betrayed. 'cause you don't, you do not believe that your comment

1361
01:27:07,775 --> 01:27:11,395
Speaker 5:  is going to be used in that way. Right? It is meant to be in a

1362
01:27:11,715 --> 01:27:15,435
Speaker 5:  specific spot for a specific community. And I think once you start moving

1363
01:27:15,435 --> 01:27:18,995
Speaker 5:  that around, and particularly once you start putting dollars behind it that

1364
01:27:19,015 --> 01:27:22,755
Speaker 5:  you, the user are not seeing that starts to get really uncomfortable really

1365
01:27:22,755 --> 01:27:25,835
Speaker 5:  fast. So I understand why Reddit is doing this. There, there's like

1366
01:27:26,145 --> 01:27:30,075
Speaker 5:  something I think very smart about, Hey, there's

1367
01:27:30,075 --> 01:27:33,235
Speaker 5:  people saying nice things about you and like having fun with your stuff.

1368
01:27:33,255 --> 01:27:36,755
Speaker 5:  Why don't like just promote that instead of putting a boring ad that nobody

1369
01:27:36,755 --> 01:27:40,555
Speaker 5:  wants to read. I like that. But yeah, they have to be really careful.

1370
01:27:40,745 --> 01:27:44,355
Speaker 5:  Like these, you know, community is everything for Reddit

1371
01:27:44,615 --> 01:27:47,835
Speaker 5:  and this is a thing that is disruptive of that in a, in a very real way.

1372
01:27:48,225 --> 01:27:51,675
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I would just encourage everybody to go look at the screenshot in Jay's

1373
01:27:51,675 --> 01:27:55,435
Speaker 4:  story, which we'll put in the show notes. It's a lucid air ad that just looks

1374
01:27:55,435 --> 01:27:58,275
Speaker 4:  like a normal ad. It has a picture of the, the car, it looks like a Reddit

1375
01:27:58,295 --> 01:28:01,795
Speaker 4:  ad. And then right below it there's an AI summary that says

1376
01:28:01,795 --> 01:28:05,075
Speaker 4:  Redditers show excitement for Lucid Air's performance, quality and innovation.

1377
01:28:05,225 --> 01:28:08,115
Speaker 4:  They also appreciate the company's service and delivery. And then it has

1378
01:28:08,115 --> 01:28:11,995
Speaker 4:  a, a side scrolling list of presumably positive

1379
01:28:12,125 --> 01:28:13,355
Speaker 4:  posts about Lucid. This

1380
01:28:13,555 --> 01:28:17,155
Speaker 5:  Is, I'm looking at this gif this is the worst possible version of this feature.

1381
01:28:17,155 --> 01:28:19,475
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like I just, I don't understand this at all. It,

1382
01:28:19,615 --> 01:28:23,515
Speaker 4:  It feels so disingenuous and like not representative of what is actually

1383
01:28:23,515 --> 01:28:24,355
Speaker 4:  great about Reddit.

1384
01:28:24,535 --> 01:28:26,755
Speaker 5:  No, no. This is, this doesn't make sense at all. Yeah,

1385
01:28:26,955 --> 01:28:27,355
Speaker 4:  I, I'm,

1386
01:28:27,575 --> 01:28:30,035
Speaker 5:  And this feels terrible if you're one of these users too. Like, it looks

1387
01:28:30,035 --> 01:28:30,915
Speaker 5:  like you made an ad.

1388
01:28:31,505 --> 01:28:34,955
Speaker 4:  Yeah. That's alright. Two more things that we should get outta here. First

1389
01:28:34,955 --> 01:28:38,475
Speaker 4:  thing, the Senate passed the Genius Bill, a terrific,

1390
01:28:39,355 --> 01:28:42,995
Speaker 4:  terrific acronym to get to Genius. I, I'm very proud of this for everybody.

1391
01:28:43,975 --> 01:28:47,555
Speaker 4:  And basically what it does is it establishes a regulatory framework for stable

1392
01:28:47,645 --> 01:28:51,635
Speaker 4:  coins and crypto tokens, basically so that private companies can

1393
01:28:51,635 --> 01:28:55,275
Speaker 4:  now launch digital coins pegged to the value of the US dollar.

1394
01:28:57,005 --> 01:29:00,905
Speaker 4:  As far as I can tell Jake, this is a huge win for crypto people, right? Like

1395
01:29:00,905 --> 01:29:03,160
Speaker 4:  every, every, as far everybody seems very excited that this is

1396
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:06,345
Speaker 5:  Happening. Yeah. I I think the idea is that it legitimizes stable coins.

1397
01:29:06,345 --> 01:29:10,265
Speaker 5:  It also, it also means that the US is not going to, you know, alternatively

1398
01:29:10,355 --> 01:29:14,105
Speaker 5:  crack down on them. Right? True. I think that's the bigger fear. And and

1399
01:29:14,105 --> 01:29:17,745
Speaker 5:  this is saying, Nope, go ahead, go do your thing. I read through some of

1400
01:29:17,745 --> 01:29:21,505
Speaker 5:  the bill and it, it does put some like, I think, you know,

1401
01:29:21,805 --> 01:29:25,305
Speaker 5:  useful requirements to place, right? It, it requires that you

1402
01:29:25,865 --> 01:29:29,625
Speaker 5:  actually back your crypto token with, with,

1403
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:34,065
Speaker 5:  you know, real assets. It requires that once a month you publish what those

1404
01:29:34,065 --> 01:29:37,785
Speaker 5:  assets are. So there is some transparency and there is some requirements

1405
01:29:37,945 --> 01:29:38,185
Speaker 5:  here.

1406
01:29:40,255 --> 01:29:44,055
Speaker 5:  I have to say this still feels like a, you know,

1407
01:29:44,405 --> 01:29:47,815
Speaker 5:  product in need of a market to me.

1408
01:29:49,555 --> 01:29:53,295
Speaker 5:  But yeah, this is just a win for the crypto industry. It it is an

1409
01:29:53,295 --> 01:29:55,855
Speaker 5:  allowance for them to make these tokens.

1410
01:29:56,925 --> 01:30:00,055
Speaker 5:  Theoretically. It will make them less scammy, theoretically.

1411
01:30:00,285 --> 01:30:04,215
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I I would encourage anyone who wants to know how this stuff works to

1412
01:30:04,215 --> 01:30:07,575
Speaker 4:  read about Tether, which is a really fascinating, stable coin and probably

1413
01:30:07,575 --> 01:30:11,415
Speaker 4:  the most successful one we've had so far has also had a just

1414
01:30:12,045 --> 01:30:14,935
Speaker 4:  long running series of shenanigans around it. And I think

1415
01:30:15,765 --> 01:30:19,655
Speaker 4:  it's a good, it's a good place to understand like how this works

1416
01:30:19,715 --> 01:30:22,495
Speaker 4:  and where it can both go really well and get really weird.

1417
01:30:24,075 --> 01:30:27,895
Speaker 4:  But yeah, the, the incursion of crypto people into the government

1418
01:30:28,775 --> 01:30:32,255
Speaker 4:  continues a pace. And one of the interesting things about this was a lot

1419
01:30:32,255 --> 01:30:36,215
Speaker 4:  of the Democrat opposition to this bill has been

1420
01:30:36,215 --> 01:30:39,095
Speaker 4:  about essentially like Trump coin exists and now this makes

1421
01:30:39,595 --> 01:30:43,575
Speaker 4:  Donald Trump, it just lets him regulate his own money now. And that's

1422
01:30:43,575 --> 01:30:46,495
Speaker 4:  a strange thing. And so we will, we will have to see how all of that shakes

1423
01:30:46,495 --> 01:30:50,295
Speaker 4:  out, but let's end on some better news, which I am

1424
01:30:50,295 --> 01:30:53,975
Speaker 4:  much more unabashedly excited about, which is

1425
01:30:54,075 --> 01:30:57,775
Speaker 4:  new fedi verse stuff for threads. And

1426
01:30:59,255 --> 01:31:02,295
Speaker 4:  normally this is where Neli And I just like gas each other up about how great

1427
01:31:02,295 --> 01:31:05,895
Speaker 4:  the Fedi verse is. My question for you, Jake, is, are you excited about this

1428
01:31:06,155 --> 01:31:06,375
Speaker 4:  at

1429
01:31:06,375 --> 01:31:10,055
Speaker 5:  All? That's so funny. I I was gonna flip this back around because I, I'm

1430
01:31:10,055 --> 01:31:13,695
Speaker 5:  the person who's, I, I'm a little more skeptical. I was gonna ask you,

1431
01:31:13,995 --> 01:31:17,895
Speaker 5:  it seems to me that some of the Fedi verse momentum

1432
01:31:18,595 --> 01:31:22,295
Speaker 5:  has maybe slowed down. And admittedly this is a, this is a pretty big

1433
01:31:22,455 --> 01:31:25,855
Speaker 5:  announcement because I think when Threads launched, I think it was at Peak

1434
01:31:26,005 --> 01:31:29,655
Speaker 5:  fedi verse hype, and they're like, we're gonna be won the same with the Fedi

1435
01:31:29,655 --> 01:31:33,175
Speaker 5:  verse. Yeah. And then last year they're like, there's some fedi verse if

1436
01:31:33,175 --> 01:31:37,135
Speaker 5:  you want it. And now maybe there's finally a little bit

1437
01:31:37,135 --> 01:31:40,975
Speaker 5:  more fedi verse, but it does feel like in some

1438
01:31:40,975 --> 01:31:44,055
Speaker 5:  ways it now feels like things are even more fragmented to me. Right? Like

1439
01:31:44,535 --> 01:31:48,495
Speaker 5:  nowadays we're like, blue Sky has a personality. You know, what you get

1440
01:31:48,495 --> 01:31:52,415
Speaker 5:  on Blue Sky Threads is a personality, you know, what you get on on, on threads.

1441
01:31:52,895 --> 01:31:56,375
Speaker 5:  I don't know what's happening on Mastodon, but it is, it is there,

1442
01:31:56,635 --> 01:31:58,695
Speaker 4:  It very much has its own personality. Yeah.

1443
01:31:58,835 --> 01:31:59,325
Speaker 5:  So I I

1444
01:31:59,475 --> 01:32:00,205
Speaker 4:  Very much So

1445
01:32:00,925 --> 01:32:04,805
Speaker 5:  I think like, honestly thi this is, it is encouraging to me to

1446
01:32:04,805 --> 01:32:08,685
Speaker 5:  see that Threads is still pushing forward on this. 'cause I, I,

1447
01:32:08,805 --> 01:32:12,725
Speaker 5:  I could very easily have seen them just being like, hmm. And, and letting

1448
01:32:12,725 --> 01:32:15,645
Speaker 5:  it drop. But I am curious from your perspective, somebody who is following

1449
01:32:15,645 --> 01:32:19,525
Speaker 5:  the Fed averse stuff much more closely. How, how you feel

1450
01:32:19,525 --> 01:32:22,485
Speaker 5:  about the momentum for, for the Fedi verse right now,

1451
01:32:22,985 --> 01:32:26,885
Speaker 4:  I'm torn. So the, the news we should say it was essentially now there

1452
01:32:26,885 --> 01:32:30,485
Speaker 4:  is a, a semi dedicated feed

1453
01:32:30,665 --> 01:32:34,525
Speaker 4:  in the Threads app for Fedi verse posts. And I say semi dedicate

1454
01:32:34,525 --> 01:32:38,325
Speaker 4:  because it's, it's a feed within the following feed. So if you

1455
01:32:38,325 --> 01:32:41,285
Speaker 4:  want to get there, you have to open the app, go to your following feed, and

1456
01:32:41,285 --> 01:32:44,165
Speaker 4:  then there's a little menu at the top that shows you fedi verse post and

1457
01:32:44,165 --> 01:32:47,325
Speaker 4:  you tap that and you go to the fedi verse feed. So it's, it's there and it

1458
01:32:47,325 --> 01:32:51,005
Speaker 4:  is like front ish and center ish, but it's not like

1459
01:32:51,235 --> 01:32:54,685
Speaker 4:  full fedi verse integration with the, for you feed on threats.

1460
01:32:55,905 --> 01:32:59,885
Speaker 4:  But it is a meaningful integration of like, now you can see fedi verse

1461
01:32:59,975 --> 01:33:02,685
Speaker 4:  posts inside of threats. And that's a, that's a real thing.

1462
01:33:04,475 --> 01:33:08,365
Speaker 4:  What I find more, maybe not alarming, but

1463
01:33:08,365 --> 01:33:12,125
Speaker 4:  potentially worrisome is talking to Peter

1464
01:33:12,185 --> 01:33:14,885
Speaker 4:  Coddle, who's a, a software engineer at Meta working on a lot of this stuff

1465
01:33:14,905 --> 01:33:18,845
Speaker 4:  and seems to be kind of the, the spokesperson for a lot of meta's

1466
01:33:19,035 --> 01:33:21,045
Speaker 4:  threads work and Fedi verse work.

1467
01:33:22,595 --> 01:33:25,685
Speaker 4:  Meta doesn't seem to know exactly what it wants to do here, which I think

1468
01:33:25,685 --> 01:33:28,125
Speaker 4:  is really interesting. There's, there's one vision of the Fedi verse that

1469
01:33:28,125 --> 01:33:28,445
Speaker 4:  is like

1470
01:33:29,995 --> 01:33:33,565
Speaker 4:  perfectly interoperable, interconnected, everything, right? Like

1471
01:33:34,085 --> 01:33:37,525
Speaker 4:  I can post from one place to another place, you can like it and I'll see

1472
01:33:37,525 --> 01:33:40,845
Speaker 4:  it and we can have a sort of cross platform conversation

1473
01:33:41,465 --> 01:33:45,125
Speaker 4:  and like what if Facebook was, the internet is like that way of thinking

1474
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:47,125
Speaker 4:  about it, right? And that is

1475
01:33:48,645 --> 01:33:52,205
Speaker 4:  exciting but also complicated. And then there's another version of the Fedi

1476
01:33:52,205 --> 01:33:55,805
Speaker 4:  verse that is basically like, there are just a million

1477
01:33:56,585 --> 01:33:59,805
Speaker 4:  things in a bucket, right? Everything is content and, and

1478
01:34:00,355 --> 01:34:04,245
Speaker 4:  newsletters are a type of post and images are a type of post and videos are

1479
01:34:04,245 --> 01:34:07,645
Speaker 4:  a type of post and podcasts are a type of post. And all those posts go into

1480
01:34:07,985 --> 01:34:11,845
Speaker 4:  one giant database of posts. And then the cool thing

1481
01:34:11,845 --> 01:34:15,085
Speaker 4:  about the Fedi verse is you can build any kind of app you want to both create

1482
01:34:15,465 --> 01:34:19,325
Speaker 4:  and, and consume those posts. That's a very different idea

1483
01:34:19,325 --> 01:34:22,005
Speaker 4:  than the sort of completely interoperable social network, right? It's just

1484
01:34:22,005 --> 01:34:25,805
Speaker 4:  an, it's a like content machine that is not run by one company.

1485
01:34:26,995 --> 01:34:30,955
Speaker 4:  Both very cool, very different. And meta does not seem

1486
01:34:30,955 --> 01:34:34,795
Speaker 4:  to know which of those it wants threads to be. So right now it's much

1487
01:34:34,795 --> 01:34:38,555
Speaker 4:  more like you, it it, the fedi verse feed in threads is basically like an

1488
01:34:38,595 --> 01:34:42,435
Speaker 4:  RSS reader for Fedi verse posts. And that's not nothing, but it's not a

1489
01:34:42,435 --> 01:34:46,155
Speaker 4:  completely interoperable social network. And then

1490
01:34:46,335 --> 01:34:50,095
Speaker 4:  on the flip side, they're starting to do some of this work where like if

1491
01:34:50,175 --> 01:34:54,055
Speaker 4:  I, if I post and you like something in a fedi verse app that comes back to

1492
01:34:54,055 --> 01:34:58,005
Speaker 4:  threads, but that continues to be kind of messy and

1493
01:34:58,015 --> 01:35:01,725
Speaker 4:  weird. And So I I just, we're at this point now where

1494
01:35:02,125 --> 01:35:06,085
Speaker 4:  somebody needs to decide what we're doing here. And I think, I have thought

1495
01:35:06,085 --> 01:35:09,765
Speaker 4:  for the last year it would be threads that just by virtue

1496
01:35:09,905 --> 01:35:12,805
Speaker 4:  of its size and by virtue of meta's importance to the internet

1497
01:35:13,435 --> 01:35:17,165
Speaker 4:  threads would dictate a lot of things. And from what I've heard from Fedi

1498
01:35:17,165 --> 01:35:19,885
Speaker 4:  verse people, the threads folks have actually been pretty good citizens of

1499
01:35:19,885 --> 01:35:22,845
Speaker 4:  this. They have worked with the protocol, they have played by the rules,

1500
01:35:22,845 --> 01:35:26,645
Speaker 4:  they have been, you know, useful members of different systems

1501
01:35:26,865 --> 01:35:30,605
Speaker 4:  and, and actually part of meetings rather than just like coming

1502
01:35:30,705 --> 01:35:33,685
Speaker 4:  and dictating how all this is gonna work because platform's huge. But at

1503
01:35:33,885 --> 01:35:37,525
Speaker 4:  some point somebody has to just look at it and be like, here's what this

1504
01:35:37,525 --> 01:35:41,285
Speaker 4:  is for. And I still don't see that. And I worry

1505
01:35:41,355 --> 01:35:45,005
Speaker 4:  even talking to them that they don't know what it is and until they, until

1506
01:35:45,005 --> 01:35:48,725
Speaker 4:  someone decides what it is, it's gonna keep kind of being nothing.

1507
01:35:49,935 --> 01:35:53,835
Speaker 4:  And, and part of me is it like at this point now we're two

1508
01:35:53,835 --> 01:35:57,395
Speaker 4:  and a half years into the sort of post

1509
01:35:57,785 --> 01:36:01,475
Speaker 4:  Twitter era and it doesn't feel like we've made

1510
01:36:01,715 --> 01:36:05,155
Speaker 4:  progress. And I'm sort of like, what if we just had an answer?

1511
01:36:05,625 --> 01:36:08,635
Speaker 4:  Like I don't even, I don't even care what it is, just pick one of the things

1512
01:36:08,855 --> 01:36:12,355
Speaker 4:  and start doing it in a like, powerful, mainstream way

1513
01:36:13,785 --> 01:36:16,605
Speaker 4:  and instead we're we're kind of like, we're we're half answering a hundred

1514
01:36:16,605 --> 01:36:17,245
Speaker 4:  different questions.

1515
01:36:17,625 --> 01:36:20,845
Speaker 5:  No, I I think that makes a lot of sense. And and this is what I think is,

1516
01:36:20,985 --> 01:36:24,645
Speaker 5:  is so strange about this, the current state of the Fedi verse,

1517
01:36:25,945 --> 01:36:29,885
Speaker 5:  in some ways it feels like there are more fedi verse

1518
01:36:30,045 --> 01:36:33,205
Speaker 5:  products and in some ways they feel more siloed to me,

1519
01:36:34,135 --> 01:36:38,045
Speaker 5:  right? Somehow we've ended up in a universe where I

1520
01:36:38,045 --> 01:36:41,685
Speaker 5:  can go on these different networks that accomplish the same thing that are

1521
01:36:41,745 --> 01:36:45,685
Speaker 5:  all allegedly interoperable, but most of which

1522
01:36:46,505 --> 01:36:49,905
Speaker 5:  are basically just the one network. And

1523
01:36:50,365 --> 01:36:54,115
Speaker 5:  you know, I think with threads it's like, just do it, right?

1524
01:36:54,185 --> 01:36:58,075
Speaker 5:  Like why like you have this technology, you have a giant team, just do it.

1525
01:36:58,285 --> 01:36:58,635
Speaker 5:  Right?

1526
01:37:00,905 --> 01:37:03,165
Speaker 5:  And I don't quite know why they haven't. And I think maybe this is because

1527
01:37:03,165 --> 01:37:06,925
Speaker 5:  they haven't quite figured out how they want to interact with the Fedi verse,

1528
01:37:07,315 --> 01:37:11,205
Speaker 5:  what they want their fed averse input to be. And

1529
01:37:11,785 --> 01:37:15,285
Speaker 5:  you know, this is the thing, right? It, it comes from a very big company

1530
01:37:15,285 --> 01:37:19,245
Speaker 5:  that has its own interests and there's a a, a lot that

1531
01:37:19,245 --> 01:37:23,125
Speaker 5:  they have at stake there. And so it makes sense that they're taking a slow

1532
01:37:23,285 --> 01:37:26,685
Speaker 5:  approach. But I think that also just makes it so much more complicated for

1533
01:37:26,975 --> 01:37:29,765
Speaker 5:  every other player in the space. 'cause you just don't know what they're

1534
01:37:29,765 --> 01:37:33,365
Speaker 5:  gonna do when they're gonna do it. And I think, you know, this, this does

1535
01:37:33,395 --> 01:37:36,365
Speaker 5:  feel meaningful to me. It feels really meaningful to me that they are continuing

1536
01:37:36,365 --> 01:37:39,685
Speaker 5:  to build this, that you actually will be able to get fed stuff. And it's

1537
01:37:39,685 --> 01:37:42,605
Speaker 5:  just one of those things where it's like, oh, it's in a sub menu, right?

1538
01:37:42,715 --> 01:37:43,005
Speaker 5:  Like

1539
01:37:43,305 --> 01:37:47,005
Speaker 4:  It just feels like it's very hard for me to imagine Mark

1540
01:37:47,005 --> 01:37:50,685
Speaker 4:  Zuckerberg who is desperately committed to get people back on

1541
01:37:50,965 --> 01:37:54,165
Speaker 4:  Facebook and integrate ads everywhere. Also being

1542
01:37:55,055 --> 01:37:59,005
Speaker 4:  super enthusiastic about the idea of more interoperability

1543
01:37:59,005 --> 01:38:02,325
Speaker 4:  with other platforms. Right? And I just, I've hit this point now where like,

1544
01:38:02,945 --> 01:38:06,605
Speaker 4:  as far as I can tell, which is frankly not very far

1545
01:38:07,625 --> 01:38:10,405
Speaker 4:  the to do the fedi verse inside of meta is like one of those things you're

1546
01:38:10,405 --> 01:38:13,005
Speaker 4:  doing and kind of hoping Mark doesn't notice and

1547
01:38:14,105 --> 01:38:17,405
Speaker 4:  that's just never where you wanna be Yeah. With this kind of thing. And So

1548
01:38:17,445 --> 01:38:20,765
Speaker 4:  I think I, I sincerely hope I'm wrong And I sincerely hope there's a lot

1549
01:38:20,765 --> 01:38:24,565
Speaker 4:  more coming, but it was, this was one of those things that like, I'm, I'm

1550
01:38:24,595 --> 01:38:28,245
Speaker 4:  psyched this is as far as it has gone, but it, it doesn't feel like,

1551
01:38:28,905 --> 01:38:32,505
Speaker 4:  it doesn't feel like enough to me yet. Yep. Alright,

1552
01:38:32,685 --> 01:38:35,345
Speaker 4:  one more and then we're gonna go. Alright. And this one more is, is a thing

1553
01:38:35,345 --> 01:38:38,825
Speaker 4:  we just published today. We should say we're, we're recording this on Wednesday

1554
01:38:39,505 --> 01:38:42,825
Speaker 4:  because it's Juneteenth on Thursday and today

1555
01:38:43,465 --> 01:38:47,385
Speaker 4:  Antonio de Benedetto posted his review of the Framework

1556
01:38:47,485 --> 01:38:48,265
Speaker 4:  Laptop 12

1557
01:38:49,845 --> 01:38:53,785
Speaker 4:  device that I have been personally very excited about. And boy,

1558
01:38:53,785 --> 01:38:57,625
Speaker 4:  is it exactly what I expected it to be. It's so the, this

1559
01:38:57,625 --> 01:39:00,865
Speaker 4:  thing is like the, the Framework Laptop, it's $800,

1560
01:39:01,695 --> 01:39:05,625
Speaker 4:  it's cool and pink and colorful and pastelly. It's

1561
01:39:05,625 --> 01:39:08,505
Speaker 4:  very repairable and upgradeable, which is framework's whole thing.

1562
01:39:10,015 --> 01:39:13,305
Speaker 4:  This was designed to be the like, fun, approachable

1563
01:39:13,735 --> 01:39:17,545
Speaker 4:  version of what so far has been like a very nerdy brand of

1564
01:39:17,745 --> 01:39:21,655
Speaker 4:  computers. And it's like, it's awesome but

1565
01:39:21,655 --> 01:39:25,455
Speaker 4:  it's not very good all at the same time. And that is like exactly

1566
01:39:25,455 --> 01:39:27,375
Speaker 4:  what I assumed it would be and kind of a bummer,

1567
01:39:28,405 --> 01:39:31,165
Speaker 5:  Honestly, this is exactly what I expected And I think like what it needs

1568
01:39:31,165 --> 01:39:34,845
Speaker 5:  to be, right? Like if, if, if you haven't seen what the Framework

1569
01:39:34,845 --> 01:39:38,205
Speaker 5:  Laptop 12 looks like, like please Google it, it is the most delightful looking

1570
01:39:38,225 --> 01:39:42,165
Speaker 5:  laptop. It really is. It's like these pastel like pinks and aquas, it,

1571
01:39:42,165 --> 01:39:46,005
Speaker 5:  it is like one of the most fun pieces of tech that has come out in a

1572
01:39:46,005 --> 01:39:49,955
Speaker 5:  long time. It's great. And I think if you would just replace this with like

1573
01:39:49,995 --> 01:39:53,875
Speaker 5:  a normal, beige, boring thing, you'd be like, okay, but the

1574
01:39:54,075 --> 01:39:57,235
Speaker 5:  a hundred percent I, I, I think so much of this thing is the ethos, right?

1575
01:39:57,265 --> 01:40:01,235
Speaker 5:  Like it is repairable. It is upgradable, and it is fun. And

1576
01:40:01,235 --> 01:40:04,795
Speaker 5:  you know, what, is it a perfect laptop? Absolutely not. Right?

1577
01:40:05,095 --> 01:40:08,955
Speaker 5:  But I don like, it couldn't have been, it was not going

1578
01:40:08,975 --> 01:40:12,955
Speaker 5:  to be. No, but it, but it, I think you can buy this thing and feel good

1579
01:40:12,955 --> 01:40:16,195
Speaker 5:  about it. And, And I love that. Like, I love that they, they

1580
01:40:16,345 --> 01:40:18,315
Speaker 5:  delivered on, I think what they were promising here.

1581
01:40:18,495 --> 01:40:22,165
Speaker 4:  And there were a lot of things that framework

1582
01:40:22,185 --> 01:40:25,445
Speaker 4:  didn't do well here that are actually pretty easy to do well,

1583
01:40:26,085 --> 01:40:29,245
Speaker 4:  which I find sort of encouraging, right? Like the webcam is pretty bad

1584
01:40:29,985 --> 01:40:33,525
Speaker 4:  and the, the speakers are extremely whatever, and

1585
01:40:33,865 --> 01:40:37,405
Speaker 4:  it needs more ram and a better processor, right? Like a, the beauty of this

1586
01:40:37,405 --> 01:40:40,365
Speaker 4:  thing is you can upgrade some of those things yourself over time, but B,

1587
01:40:40,365 --> 01:40:44,245
Speaker 4:  those are things that a company like framework can

1588
01:40:44,245 --> 01:40:48,085
Speaker 4:  just go do better next time. Yeah. So I think to me, I, I look at this

1589
01:40:48,085 --> 01:40:51,765
Speaker 4:  and I'm like, okay, this is not the thing that I wanted it to be.

1590
01:40:51,945 --> 01:40:55,925
Speaker 4:  The performance isn't amazing. The keyboard isn't amazing. There's just like

1591
01:40:55,925 --> 01:40:59,045
Speaker 4:  a lot of sort of near misses, but they all feel

1592
01:40:59,315 --> 01:41:03,165
Speaker 4:  correctable. And I think a Antonio's takeaway was very much like, this

1593
01:41:03,165 --> 01:41:06,565
Speaker 4:  is a great idea. This is a thing that should exist. This will appeal to lots

1594
01:41:06,565 --> 01:41:10,485
Speaker 4:  of people. It just a, we need framework to deliver

1595
01:41:10,485 --> 01:41:13,525
Speaker 4:  on the upgrade path here and like, make this thing last a long time, which

1596
01:41:13,525 --> 01:41:17,205
Speaker 4:  the company's done a pretty good job of so far. But also like, stay at this

1597
01:41:17,205 --> 01:41:21,085
Speaker 4:  one, right? Like keep making adorable laptops and a couple of them from

1598
01:41:21,145 --> 01:41:24,605
Speaker 4:  now you'll have one that's awesome. Like, you know, you know what this is

1599
01:41:24,605 --> 01:41:28,525
Speaker 4:  making me think of actually is, do you remember the Google Pixel

1600
01:41:28,555 --> 01:41:31,965
Speaker 4:  book that was the very thin, like

1601
01:41:32,225 --> 01:41:33,325
Speaker 5:  Yes. Oh my gosh,

1602
01:41:33,325 --> 01:41:37,005
Speaker 4:  Yes. White and gray laptop that Google made. Yeah, I loved that thing to

1603
01:41:37,195 --> 01:41:37,485
Speaker 4:  bits

1604
01:41:37,485 --> 01:41:38,965
Speaker 5:  That it was thing had some fans,

1605
01:41:39,585 --> 01:41:42,685
Speaker 4:  One of my absolute favorite laptops of all time. And the only downside of

1606
01:41:42,685 --> 01:41:46,045
Speaker 4:  it was it had a just big giant

1607
01:41:46,355 --> 01:41:48,605
Speaker 4:  monster bezel and looked sort

1608
01:42:17,155 --> 01:42:20,455
Speaker 5:  I'm excited, I like I framework has been like, kind of on a roll putting

1609
01:42:20,455 --> 01:42:24,415
Speaker 5:  out some cool hardware and yeah, if they can keep at this and like keep doing

1610
01:42:24,415 --> 01:42:24,935
Speaker 5:  this on a

1611
01:42:54,095 --> 01:42:56,295
Speaker 4:  anybody who's been in a long time. And I would, I would very much like it

1612
01:42:56,295 --> 01:42:59,175
Speaker 4:  work in the right market to work. I just want a pink laptop. Like, I don't

1613
01:42:59,175 --> 01:43:02,135
Speaker 4:  think I knew I wanted a pink laptop until I read Antonio's review And I was

1614
01:43:02,135 --> 01:43:05,095
Speaker 4:  like, this, this color scheme like really works for me. It really works.

1615
01:43:05,285 --> 01:43:09,255
Speaker 4:  Yeah. All right. We have gone way over, Jake, it's been a delight to do this

1616
01:43:09,255 --> 01:43:12,975
Speaker 4:  with you. This is good. I'm now like nearing the end of

1617
01:43:13,115 --> 01:43:16,055
Speaker 4:  my time on The Vergecast before I go on parental leave and I'm starting to

1618
01:43:16,055 --> 01:43:19,975
Speaker 4:  have real like graduation sadness. It's like I'm never gonna see my friends

1619
01:43:19,975 --> 01:43:22,615
Speaker 4:  again. This is, this is, this is terrible, but

1620
01:43:22,615 --> 01:43:24,855
Speaker 5:  We're taking your keys away. It's been, you're not gonna be allowed back

1621
01:43:24,855 --> 01:43:25,255
Speaker 5:  in the Zoom.

1622
01:43:25,655 --> 01:43:28,255
Speaker 4:  I honestly think it's possible that I'm just never gonna be allowed to do

1623
01:43:28,255 --> 01:43:31,055
Speaker 4:  The Vergecast again. Everybody's gonna realize it's much better once I'm
