Description: The Verge's Nilay Patel, David Pierce, and Alex Cranz discuss Nilay's review of the Apple Vision Pro, and then answer questions from our listeners.

2
00:00:02,525 --> 00:00:06,135
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Variable

3
00:00:06,135 --> 00:00:09,655
Speaker 2:  Immersion. I'm your friend, David Pierce, and I am sitting here updating

4
00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:13,695
Speaker 2:  a bunch of apps on my Meta Quest. Three So I tend to

5
00:00:13,695 --> 00:00:17,655
Speaker 2:  go kind of in and out with VR stuff. I had a long run of doing

6
00:00:17,855 --> 00:00:21,335
Speaker 2:  workouts and Supernatural So I was using the thing almost every day. And

7
00:00:21,335 --> 00:00:24,895
Speaker 2:  then, you know, it was winter, I got Lazy So I didn't do that for a while.

8
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:28,735
Speaker 2:  And then recently I got really into the Assassin's Creed game, Assassin's

9
00:00:28,735 --> 00:00:32,455
Speaker 2:  Creed Nexus vr, it's super cool. But then I had one of those moments of being

10
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:35,735
Speaker 2:  like, okay, I'm spending too much time with this game. Time to stop. But

11
00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:39,655
Speaker 2:  recently I've been picking this thing back up because I'm gonna be honest

12
00:00:39,655 --> 00:00:43,495
Speaker 2:  with you, I've been having some fomo. So this week is the week

13
00:00:43,565 --> 00:00:47,415
Speaker 2:  Apple's Vision Pro comes out. We've been waiting for apple's, ar, vr,

14
00:00:47,705 --> 00:00:51,575
Speaker 2:  mixed reality, whatever you wanna call it, $3,500 headset to come

15
00:00:51,575 --> 00:00:54,935
Speaker 2:  out. And it's coming out this week on Friday, February 2nd. I've been hearing

16
00:00:54,935 --> 00:00:58,215
Speaker 2:  from people who pre-ordered one. I've been hearing lots of ideas about apps

17
00:00:58,215 --> 00:01:01,175
Speaker 2:  that are gonna come out. It all seems very exciting and it's just making

18
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:04,375
Speaker 2:  me feel bad 'cause I don't have one. But you know who does have one is NELI

19
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:08,135
Speaker 2:  Patel, the Verges editor in chief and my Vergecast co-host. So we figured

20
00:01:08,155 --> 00:01:11,535
Speaker 2:  for this episode, we would just grill NELI about the Vision Pro. He spent

21
00:01:11,535 --> 00:01:15,375
Speaker 2:  the last few days writing about it, testing it, trying to figure out

22
00:01:15,485 --> 00:01:19,455
Speaker 2:  what this thing means in the world and whether it's worth your

23
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:23,415
Speaker 2:  $3,500. So we got lots of questions from you. We have lots of questions for

24
00:01:23,595 --> 00:01:27,575
Speaker 2:  Eli Alex and I are gonna spend, I mean potentially like

25
00:01:27,575 --> 00:01:31,455
Speaker 2:  many, many, many hours asking Eli all of our questions about the Vision

26
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:35,455
Speaker 2:  Pro to figure out not only if it's better than this thing, the

27
00:01:35,575 --> 00:01:39,535
Speaker 2:  Quest three that I'm in right now, but if it's the future, is this. The

28
00:01:39,535 --> 00:01:43,255
Speaker 2:  next thing is this where we're headed. So that's what we're gonna do for

29
00:01:43,255 --> 00:01:46,975
Speaker 2:  the whole rest of this episode. It's All Vision Pro all the time, all week,

30
00:01:47,005 --> 00:01:50,615
Speaker 2:  because it's headset week. All that is coming up in just a second.

31
00:01:50,835 --> 00:01:54,535
Speaker 2:  But first I feel like I just guilted myself into doing a workout. So I'm

32
00:01:54,535 --> 00:01:58,455
Speaker 2:  gonna pop into Supernatural for a little bit, do some boxing, and then we're

33
00:01:58,455 --> 00:02:00,815
Speaker 2:  gonna get to it. This is The Vergecast. We'll be right back.

34
00:03:24,335 --> 00:03:28,105
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. Alright, it is 9:10 AM on Tuesday,

35
00:03:28,135 --> 00:03:32,025
Speaker 2:  January 30th, which means 10 minutes ago was when the embargo

36
00:03:32,085 --> 00:03:34,905
Speaker 2:  for Vision Pro reviews lifted. There's a bunch of 'em out there. Our friend

37
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:38,745
Speaker 2:  Mark has, Brownley has one. Our friend Joanna Stern has one a scene that

38
00:03:38,745 --> 00:03:42,025
Speaker 2:  has a video. I was watching, I, Justine has a fun video that I was just poking

39
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:45,625
Speaker 2:  through. There's a bunch of good stuff out there. But before the review

40
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,585
Speaker 2:  publishes is actually one of my favorite moments, especially being sort of

41
00:03:49,585 --> 00:03:52,865
Speaker 2:  inside the process because you go through all this testing and you have to

42
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:57,145
Speaker 2:  decide what to make of this thing. Not just is it good not, is

43
00:03:57,145 --> 00:04:00,825
Speaker 2:  it cool? Does it have some neat features? But is this a good package?

44
00:04:01,045 --> 00:04:05,025
Speaker 2:  Is this worth buying? Is it worth the price? And I think the challenge

45
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:08,305
Speaker 2:  for us and from watching some of these reviews for a lot of other folks is

46
00:04:08,305 --> 00:04:10,945
Speaker 2:  to figure out what to make of this thing. Everybody seems to agree that the

47
00:04:10,945 --> 00:04:14,625
Speaker 2:  tech is amazing. There's just no question that Apple did a

48
00:04:14,825 --> 00:04:18,705
Speaker 2:  lot of the things it was trying to do very well. But to what end?

49
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:22,745
Speaker 2:  What is this for? What is this thing about? What are you supposed to do with

50
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:26,505
Speaker 2:  it? Why does it exist? These are the big like existential questions

51
00:04:26,655 --> 00:04:30,425
Speaker 2:  that both as a reviewer and as a person thinking about buying a product like

52
00:04:30,425 --> 00:04:34,265
Speaker 2:  this, you have to think more about with a first generation

53
00:04:34,265 --> 00:04:38,145
Speaker 2:  device like this, it seems like the Vision Pro really is the first of something,

54
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:42,305
Speaker 2:  but exactly what that is and where it's going and whether we want it is

55
00:04:42,305 --> 00:04:46,185
Speaker 2:  hard to know. So about 24 hours ago as I'm

56
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:49,145
Speaker 2:  recording this, we sat down with Eli, we dragged him into the studio in this

57
00:04:49,145 --> 00:04:52,665
Speaker 2:  like haze of doing all of the review stuff and

58
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:56,345
Speaker 2:  tried to go through that before the review publishes, before he'd seen anything

59
00:04:56,345 --> 00:04:59,545
Speaker 2:  else before we'd gotten comments and everything, I just wanted us to sort

60
00:04:59,545 --> 00:05:03,465
Speaker 2:  of pick his brain about the review. So for the whole rest of

61
00:05:03,465 --> 00:05:07,185
Speaker 2:  the show, it's gonna be just me, Alex Cranz and NELI

62
00:05:07,185 --> 00:05:10,385
Speaker 2:  Patel. And we are going to go deep on the Vision Pro

63
00:05:10,955 --> 00:05:14,785
Speaker 2:  Eli's review how he felt, what it was like to use this thing and a whole

64
00:05:14,785 --> 00:05:18,585
Speaker 2:  bunch more. Let's get into it. NELI Patel, welcome.

65
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:22,545
Speaker 2:  Hello, Alex Krantz. Hello. Hello. NELI, we have talk about

66
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:26,305
Speaker 2:  your life status. We've all reviewed gadgets, all three of us. And I know

67
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:30,185
Speaker 2:  that this is the point of the process where it can either be going very

68
00:05:30,185 --> 00:05:33,865
Speaker 2:  well or you can be ruining a lot of things you've decided about your life

69
00:05:34,045 --> 00:05:37,105
Speaker 2:  and decisions you've made in the past that have led you to this moment. How

70
00:05:37,105 --> 00:05:37,385
Speaker 2:  you feeling?

71
00:05:37,985 --> 00:05:41,185
Speaker 5:  I want the audience to know that David has chosen to record this podcast

72
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:44,505
Speaker 5:  with me at the most vulnerable time for any reviewer.

73
00:05:44,735 --> 00:05:47,985
Speaker 2:  This was very much on purpose. Yes, it's, it's right now it is

74
00:05:47,985 --> 00:05:51,465
Speaker 2:  27 hours before embargo time. Yeah.

75
00:05:51,675 --> 00:05:55,465
Speaker 2:  Which is when everything about everything you've ever done in your life is

76
00:05:55,705 --> 00:05:57,285
Speaker 2:  suddenly up in the air. Yeah.

77
00:05:57,285 --> 00:06:00,645
Speaker 5:  So I'll just, just to give people the context. I've had the Vision Pro for

78
00:06:01,405 --> 00:06:04,925
Speaker 5:  a little less than a week. It'll be six days when you hear this. Apple

79
00:06:05,285 --> 00:06:08,645
Speaker 5:  Security arrived at my house, the Vision Pro last week. It was pretty intense

80
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,405
Speaker 5:  and we've had it, we've been using it. This is the moment in the review process

81
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:16,285
Speaker 5:  where the video is shot, it's being edited, the written

82
00:06:16,465 --> 00:06:20,285
Speaker 5:  review is mostly written, it's in edits. And I'm just sitting

83
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:23,645
Speaker 5:  around waiting to see if I'm right, which again is the most

84
00:06:23,655 --> 00:06:27,205
Speaker 5:  vulnerable part of any review. Like I've done, I've said what I think, here's

85
00:06:27,205 --> 00:06:30,525
Speaker 5:  what I think. And then tomorrow it'll get published and everyone will yell

86
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:33,685
Speaker 5:  at me or not yell, Who knows. But, so David is like, this is when I want

87
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:37,085
Speaker 5:  to talk to you, which is mean and unfair. That's the perfect

88
00:06:37,155 --> 00:06:39,045
Speaker 2:  Time. Yeah. I feel, I feel really good about it

89
00:06:39,105 --> 00:06:42,165
Speaker 5:  And you can hear it. We've been pulling basically Allnighters for a week.

90
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:45,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And you can hear it in my voice. I think

91
00:06:45,675 --> 00:06:49,205
Speaker 2:  It's been a lot. So in an effort to make this easy on you, basically what

92
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:52,845
Speaker 2:  is going to happen here is we have a long series of questions, some of them

93
00:06:53,155 --> 00:06:56,845
Speaker 2:  from us and some of them from listeners. We ask for

94
00:06:57,045 --> 00:07:00,405
Speaker 2:  questions on the hotline and in the email and on threads. And we got like

95
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:04,325
Speaker 2:  a billion of them. Some of them are very weird. But basically

96
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:07,965
Speaker 2:  we're sort of at the top here. We're gonna go through your review, like beat

97
00:07:08,025 --> 00:07:10,365
Speaker 2:  by beat. I just, we have a bunch of questions and we're gonna talk about

98
00:07:10,365 --> 00:07:13,365
Speaker 2:  them because this thing is weird and complicated and we're gonna sort of

99
00:07:13,795 --> 00:07:17,685
Speaker 2:  wind towards your big feelings about this at the end. And then we're gonna

100
00:07:17,685 --> 00:07:20,605
Speaker 2:  get into a bunch of questions we got from people. Does that make sense? Yeah.

101
00:07:20,755 --> 00:07:24,645
Speaker 2:  Okay. So the whole first section of this is called

102
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:28,565
Speaker 2:  Is It Good? And we're just gonna name a bunch of things and we're gonna

103
00:07:28,565 --> 00:07:32,365
Speaker 2:  ask about if it's good. And Alex, you should obviously ask all the questions.

104
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:35,485
Speaker 2:  I'm missing lots of stuff going on here, but okay. We have, we have a bunch

105
00:07:35,485 --> 00:07:38,925
Speaker 2:  of these, but the first one is, is wearing the thing, is it good?

106
00:07:39,985 --> 00:07:43,645
Speaker 5:  Medium. Okay. Medium. It's heavy. It is not,

107
00:07:43,825 --> 00:07:47,805
Speaker 5:  not heavy. Everything about this product is a

108
00:07:48,085 --> 00:07:52,045
Speaker 5:  fight between what Apple wants it to be and what it is. As

109
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:55,845
Speaker 5:  I've been using the thing, there's a very clear gap between Apple's

110
00:07:56,045 --> 00:07:59,965
Speaker 5:  ambitions and dreams. And the product that they can make and the product

111
00:07:59,965 --> 00:08:03,485
Speaker 5:  they can make today is the best version of this thing that anyone has ever

112
00:08:03,485 --> 00:08:07,365
Speaker 5:  made. I, I'd wanna be very clear about that. The headset you

113
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:10,285
Speaker 5:  put on your face where you look through lenses at a screen,

114
00:08:11,265 --> 00:08:15,245
Speaker 5:  no one's ever done it like this. It is very good. It is obviously not the

115
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,805
Speaker 5:  thing that they want. And so their ambition is just like way out ahead of

116
00:08:18,805 --> 00:08:21,325
Speaker 5:  the reality of this product. And the reality of this product is that it's

117
00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:25,205
Speaker 5:  heavy. It weighs more than an 11 inch iPad Pro. 11 inch iPad Pro is four

118
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:29,085
Speaker 5:  70 grams. This one is somewhere between six and six 50 depending on its

119
00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:33,125
Speaker 5:  configuration. Then there's the headband situation

120
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:37,165
Speaker 5:  where the really cool one, that one you want to use the solo band with the

121
00:08:37,245 --> 00:08:39,605
Speaker 5:  ridges in the back and the wheel, the one they like designed the full

122
00:08:39,665 --> 00:08:41,205
Speaker 2:  Ski goggles look. Yeah. Yeah.

123
00:08:41,715 --> 00:08:45,245
Speaker 5:  It's like, and that's one I've been using. It's, it's fine, but there's,

124
00:08:45,245 --> 00:08:48,525
Speaker 5:  there's like not a lot of affordances in it. So you know, like the back of

125
00:08:48,525 --> 00:08:51,845
Speaker 5:  your head, there's like a, a ridge, you know, to your neck. Like those are

126
00:08:51,845 --> 00:08:54,725
Speaker 5:  in different spots, in different people's heads, but there's no like hinge

127
00:08:54,725 --> 00:08:58,205
Speaker 5:  point. So if you just get what you get, like the thing just compresses around

128
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:01,845
Speaker 5:  your head and wherever the back of your head lines up with your eyes,

129
00:09:02,465 --> 00:09:06,365
Speaker 5:  that's what you get. You know, it's, it's like there's just that, there's

130
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:10,045
Speaker 5:  the, the fact of the thing is there's not a lot of

131
00:09:10,045 --> 00:09:13,925
Speaker 5:  affordances to wearing it. And then when you're wearing it, it's hot. Like

132
00:09:13,985 --> 00:09:17,965
Speaker 5:  it gets hot after a while and maybe that's, you get hot after a while.

133
00:09:17,965 --> 00:09:20,925
Speaker 5:  Maybe it's, it gets hot after a while, but you're like, I'm wearing a big

134
00:09:20,925 --> 00:09:23,325
Speaker 5:  heavy thing on my face. And then you just take it off and then when you take

135
00:09:23,325 --> 00:09:26,765
Speaker 5:  it off, you're no longer looking at screens, you're just back in the world

136
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:28,005
Speaker 5:  and you're like, oh, this is very nice.

137
00:09:28,585 --> 00:09:32,525
Speaker 2:  The thing that I remember, especially with a lot of the early

138
00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:37,325
Speaker 2:  Oculus and Quest stuff was there was that feeling where you would

139
00:09:37,325 --> 00:09:41,005
Speaker 2:  take it off and you would kind of like scrunch and stretch your face because

140
00:09:41,005 --> 00:09:43,805
Speaker 2:  you would realize like your, your forehead and the sort of bridge of your

141
00:09:43,805 --> 00:09:47,285
Speaker 2:  nose had gotten just tons of pressure. Yep. As you're wearing the thing.

142
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:49,845
Speaker 2:  Is that the feeling? Like is it, is it sort of the same thing?

143
00:09:49,985 --> 00:09:53,325
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah. Especially on my forehead. Okay. I feel like after a long while

144
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:57,205
Speaker 5:  you feel like your eyebrows are just working. Like you just, you just start

145
00:09:57,205 --> 00:09:59,645
Speaker 5:  doing the thing with your eyebrows. You're like, I'm just gonna lift it with

146
00:09:59,645 --> 00:10:02,765
Speaker 5:  my face a little bit more. And then you, and then you monkey with the fit.

147
00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:07,045
Speaker 5:  It's not the worst. Like make, take the decision to take the battery out

148
00:10:07,045 --> 00:10:10,805
Speaker 5:  of it to reduce weight. I understand why they made that decision and it,

149
00:10:10,805 --> 00:10:13,965
Speaker 5:  it's fine because the thing is such a stationary product, like in its way

150
00:10:14,475 --> 00:10:17,725
Speaker 5:  that the battery just goes on the table and you're fine. but it is like they

151
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:21,725
Speaker 5:  had to do it. If they'd add the batter is that's 383 grams or

152
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:24,885
Speaker 5:  something. If they'd added another 383 grams a weight to this, it would be

153
00:10:25,045 --> 00:10:28,845
Speaker 5:  a, A disaster. Yeah. So it's as close as they can get it

154
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:32,045
Speaker 5:  to being comfortable, but for a long duration of time

155
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,405
Speaker 5:  it is not.

156
00:10:33,555 --> 00:10:33,845
Speaker 2:  Okay.

157
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:37,685
Speaker 6:  Can you expand on it being stationary? Does it mean you're just like,

158
00:10:37,775 --> 00:10:39,845
Speaker 6:  everything you do in it, you're just sitting still?

159
00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:42,925
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like you and I talk about the quest all the time. Yeah. The Quest wants

160
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:46,685
Speaker 5:  you to get up and move and play Beat Saber and

161
00:10:46,685 --> 00:10:50,645
Speaker 5:  Supernatural. And there's a games on the Quest are like virtual reality games.

162
00:10:50,645 --> 00:10:54,245
Speaker 5:  So like I'm gonna run around in virtual reality, right. I'm gonna do stuff.

163
00:10:54,395 --> 00:10:57,085
Speaker 5:  This thing is like, I'm gonna sit down and I'm gonna look at Windows. Mm.

164
00:10:57,795 --> 00:11:01,485
Speaker 5:  Okay. Like in that those windows could be everywhere, but like mostly

165
00:11:01,915 --> 00:11:05,205
Speaker 5:  it's sit down and look at stuff. There are surprisingly few

166
00:11:05,815 --> 00:11:09,565
Speaker 5:  games for this thing that feel like you need to move around. The only one

167
00:11:09,565 --> 00:11:13,005
Speaker 5:  I've seen is Superfruit Ninja, which was in a demo,

168
00:11:13,335 --> 00:11:16,885
Speaker 5:  which is not even out yet. So I haven't even gotten a chance to play Superfruit

169
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:20,405
Speaker 5:  Ninja, which is very funny. And I haven't seen a single VR game yet. There

170
00:11:20,405 --> 00:11:23,885
Speaker 5:  are some coming, right? The thing supports Unity. I'm told that

171
00:11:24,405 --> 00:11:27,325
Speaker 5:  Unity developers across the industry are working very hard on bringing games.

172
00:11:27,535 --> 00:11:30,765
Speaker 5:  We'll see, that's to be seen. But all the games right now are

173
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:33,805
Speaker 5:  mixed reality games where just like a game board is floating in space.

174
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:37,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So it seems like it is big and heavy in the way you would sort of

175
00:11:37,925 --> 00:11:41,805
Speaker 2:  expect it to be big and heavy, but not like worse than a lot of other things.

176
00:11:41,805 --> 00:11:44,405
Speaker 2:  Like it's just a headset. I feel like so much of this, and it goes back to

177
00:11:44,405 --> 00:11:47,285
Speaker 2:  that thing you were saying at the beginning, like Apple would love for this

178
00:11:47,285 --> 00:11:49,085
Speaker 2:  not to be a headset, but it's a headset.

179
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:52,965
Speaker 5:  It is super, A headset. Yeah. You're going to ask all these questions about

180
00:11:53,105 --> 00:11:57,085
Speaker 5:  is it good? And the frame for that, all of them is like, is this

181
00:11:57,085 --> 00:12:00,965
Speaker 5:  the best headset ever made? Right. And the answer is almost always yes.

182
00:12:01,945 --> 00:12:02,645
Speaker 5:  But it's a headset.

183
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:06,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So just add parentheses for a headset to all of the questions we're

184
00:12:06,365 --> 00:12:10,285
Speaker 2:  about to get to. Yeah. The next one is the displays. Are they good? This

185
00:12:10,285 --> 00:12:11,125
Speaker 2:  seems very important.

186
00:12:11,555 --> 00:12:15,405
Speaker 5:  They are displays this, this is what I mean. You cannot, the displays are

187
00:12:15,405 --> 00:12:19,365
Speaker 5:  incredible. They are a triumph of engineering that you can't see

188
00:12:19,465 --> 00:12:22,925
Speaker 5:  pixels. The pixels are smaller than red blood cells, right? They're

189
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:25,885
Speaker 5:  7.5 microns. They're about the size one

190
00:12:25,885 --> 00:12:28,605
Speaker 2:  Of those very cool and totally meaningless right?

191
00:12:28,765 --> 00:12:32,005
Speaker 5:  Compared, but it like, they're like itty bitty, like, and then each of those

192
00:12:32,225 --> 00:12:36,005
Speaker 5:  pixels has three RGB subpixels. This isn't like a PenTile

193
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,365
Speaker 5:  pattern, it's like straight apple calls it S stripe. You can go look at a

194
00:12:39,365 --> 00:12:43,245
Speaker 5:  photo, it's RGB for each sub Pixel, each of which can be individually

195
00:12:43,245 --> 00:12:46,925
Speaker 5:  controlled, like the engineering of this little display panel,

196
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:50,925
Speaker 5:  or two of them in each device. That works when you're moving your head around

197
00:12:50,995 --> 00:12:54,885
Speaker 5:  like I am beyond impressed. But then you're looking at them through

198
00:12:54,885 --> 00:12:58,845
Speaker 5:  lenses and there's just the reality of a

199
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:02,525
Speaker 5:  display in a lens system. So the lenses have specular

200
00:13:02,525 --> 00:13:05,405
Speaker 5:  highlights or what looks like specular highlight. When you look at something

201
00:13:05,405 --> 00:13:09,205
Speaker 5:  bright, the lenses have color fringing, like green

202
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:13,285
Speaker 5:  pink color fringing around the edges that if you look for

203
00:13:13,285 --> 00:13:16,765
Speaker 5:  it in certain conditions, it's just gonna be there. The lenses are slightly

204
00:13:16,765 --> 00:13:20,685
Speaker 5:  vignette. The lenses are slightly distorted at the edges. I asked

205
00:13:20,685 --> 00:13:24,125
Speaker 5:  Apple about this and this is, they know like they, they're like, we're doing

206
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:27,165
Speaker 5:  a bunch of hardware and software to minimize these effects. But as you, they

207
00:13:27,165 --> 00:13:30,125
Speaker 5:  were, they said something to me like, as you, you're well aware of displays

208
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,605
Speaker 5:  and lenses. You are obviously familiar with these problems. I was like, yeah,

209
00:13:32,605 --> 00:13:36,445
Speaker 5:  yeah, here they are. Here's a thing that I, I keep

210
00:13:36,445 --> 00:13:39,725
Speaker 5:  thinking about and I actually really want your feedback on whether this is

211
00:13:39,725 --> 00:13:42,925
Speaker 5:  important or not. Apple spec for the display is 92% of the

212
00:13:43,085 --> 00:13:46,965
Speaker 5:  DCIP three color gamut, which is an incredible thing to put on a

213
00:13:46,965 --> 00:13:47,845
Speaker 5:  webpage. That sounds really good.

214
00:13:47,845 --> 00:13:49,125
Speaker 2:  That's NELI bait right there.

215
00:13:49,525 --> 00:13:53,165
Speaker 5:  DCIP three is like, you know, high-end color gamut for cinema people,

216
00:13:53,705 --> 00:13:57,045
Speaker 5:  but it itself only represents like 53 or

217
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,845
Speaker 5:  54% of the colors your eyes can see. So 92%

218
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:03,925
Speaker 5:  of DCIP three means the displays can only show you

219
00:14:03,925 --> 00:14:07,805
Speaker 5:  49% of the colors your eyes can see. I'm like a display, you know,

220
00:14:07,825 --> 00:14:11,485
Speaker 5:  I'm a display nerd and I don't care on a laptop or a phone. Like

221
00:14:11,635 --> 00:14:15,445
Speaker 5:  this is stuff I, I think about and I like, I like reading about if you're

222
00:14:15,445 --> 00:14:18,525
Speaker 5:  like asking me to look through it all the time, I'm like, well, you just

223
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,965
Speaker 5:  threw away 50% of the color information in the world. I don't know how to

224
00:14:21,965 --> 00:14:25,205
Speaker 5:  like, I emotionally do not know how to like comprehend that, right? Because

225
00:14:25,225 --> 00:14:28,565
Speaker 5:  in every other context, I just don't care because I can just look around.

226
00:14:29,145 --> 00:14:32,605
Speaker 5:  So displays are incredible. Like I don't want to overdo it. The displays

227
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:36,565
Speaker 5:  are incredible. They are a triumph. No one has ever engineered or shipped

228
00:14:36,565 --> 00:14:40,325
Speaker 5:  displays like this at scale. They're so just think about how tiny

229
00:14:40,325 --> 00:14:43,845
Speaker 5:  those pixels are and then you're like, oh, they are still displays, right?

230
00:14:43,955 --> 00:14:45,325
Speaker 6:  Like you never forget,

231
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:49,125
Speaker 5:  Right? You never forget. You are looking at screens like

232
00:14:49,465 --> 00:14:53,325
Speaker 5:  the most screens and then on, you know, the reality pass through is camera

233
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:57,285
Speaker 5:  based. So there's just like motion blur. Even a bright room when

234
00:14:57,285 --> 00:15:00,685
Speaker 5:  you like look around, there's motion blur on the displays. You can't, you

235
00:15:00,685 --> 00:15:04,405
Speaker 5:  just can't overcome the inherent nature of cameras and displays.

236
00:15:04,825 --> 00:15:08,685
Speaker 5:  So the question is like, is are the displays good? Is really a question about

237
00:15:08,685 --> 00:15:12,525
Speaker 5:  like, how is the product designed to be used and can

238
00:15:12,525 --> 00:15:15,565
Speaker 5:  the displays do all the things that you think they should be able to do?

239
00:15:16,065 --> 00:15:18,805
Speaker 5:  And the answer is they're the most incredible displays ever. They're triumph

240
00:15:18,805 --> 00:15:21,885
Speaker 5:  of engineering. You are still looking at screens and being asked to perceive

241
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:24,885
Speaker 5:  reality through screens is a is a tall ask.

242
00:15:25,195 --> 00:15:29,085
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's a weird one. I feel like for this first run

243
00:15:29,385 --> 00:15:33,085
Speaker 2:  of this, when this technology is new to most people and

244
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:37,605
Speaker 2:  new to like existence, that feels like a somewhat acceptable

245
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:41,365
Speaker 2:  trade off, right? Like we're, we're gonna hit a point where especially with

246
00:15:41,365 --> 00:15:44,565
Speaker 2:  something like this, if I am looking at my room and then I put on a headset

247
00:15:44,585 --> 00:15:48,445
Speaker 2:  and suddenly my room, which it's still showing me is

248
00:15:48,445 --> 00:15:52,045
Speaker 2:  different, that feels bad in a way that like I turn on my TV

249
00:15:52,305 --> 00:15:55,885
Speaker 2:  and trees don't look the same color, they do out my window, but they're like

250
00:15:55,885 --> 00:15:58,485
Speaker 2:  different trees in a different place and my brain understands that that's

251
00:15:58,485 --> 00:16:01,285
Speaker 2:  a screen. Like your brain is not supposed to understand that this is a screen,

252
00:16:01,285 --> 00:16:04,525
Speaker 2:  right? Like that's what success looks like is that you forget you're looking

253
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:07,965
Speaker 2:  at screens and for now at least it feels like

254
00:16:08,705 --> 00:16:12,285
Speaker 2:  I'm looking at screens and they're very good. Like just the fact that you

255
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:15,925
Speaker 2:  didn't even mention how it feels to like read text on a

256
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:19,125
Speaker 2:  webpage feels like a victory to me because it means it was fine. Yeah. And

257
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:22,965
Speaker 2:  that is, to me, at least for this first one that's the bar is like, can

258
00:16:23,005 --> 00:16:25,885
Speaker 2:  I look at stuff? And, and it seems like we're there,

259
00:16:26,065 --> 00:16:29,685
Speaker 5:  You can read texts on a webpage that refresh rates, it can go up to a hundred

260
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:33,685
Speaker 5:  hertz. I mean, again, incredible technical achievement

261
00:16:33,685 --> 00:16:36,925
Speaker 5:  with these displays. Yeah. I I not even a hint of,

262
00:16:37,505 --> 00:16:41,325
Speaker 5:  boy, I can imagine how these displays could be better, like incredible technical

263
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:45,165
Speaker 5:  achievement with these displays and when digital information,

264
00:16:45,495 --> 00:16:49,365
Speaker 5:  right? Windows, videos, Mac mirror, like all that

265
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:53,125
Speaker 5:  stuff looks good. But again, the displays are being

266
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:56,965
Speaker 5:  asked to pass through reality and your eyes

267
00:16:56,965 --> 00:17:00,685
Speaker 5:  are better than screens and cameras. And that is a historic problem.

268
00:17:00,685 --> 00:17:02,645
Speaker 5:  Like, don don't know that we can overcome that problem.

269
00:17:03,075 --> 00:17:06,765
Speaker 6:  Well I was gonna ask, is it, you know, when you think of AR the two kind

270
00:17:06,765 --> 00:17:10,285
Speaker 6:  of most successful, I'm using big scare quotes here. Most

271
00:17:10,285 --> 00:17:12,965
Speaker 6:  successful ones have been what? Magic Leap and HoloLens.

272
00:17:13,705 --> 00:17:15,205
Speaker 2:  That's a bleak, I use the scare

273
00:17:15,205 --> 00:17:19,045
Speaker 6:  Quotes guys, I use the scare quotes. Is the experience just that, that

274
00:17:19,245 --> 00:17:22,845
Speaker 6:  that interaction with the real world through this headset, is that better

275
00:17:23,265 --> 00:17:24,805
Speaker 6:  in this than in those systems?

276
00:17:25,425 --> 00:17:28,845
Speaker 5:  What's fascinating about both of those is one, they failed two,

277
00:17:29,795 --> 00:17:33,605
Speaker 5:  there's like no AR happening in this thing. None. Oh,

278
00:17:34,205 --> 00:17:38,165
Speaker 5:  there are exactly three ar things that I have seen so far.

279
00:17:38,665 --> 00:17:42,565
Speaker 5:  And by ar I mean digital information layered over the real world

280
00:17:43,055 --> 00:17:46,925
Speaker 5:  where the real world and the virtual world interact. Okay.

281
00:17:47,055 --> 00:17:49,720
Speaker 5:  Right. So virtual reality, you're just in a virtual, a virtual world, you're

282
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,950
Speaker 5:  doing stuff in the virtual world, the real world doesn't matter. Mixed reality

283
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,325
Speaker 5:  is what most people have experienced. It's what most of this is where you're

284
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:58,005
Speaker 5:  in the real world and you just like put up virtual stuff, but there's no

285
00:17:58,005 --> 00:18:01,805
Speaker 5:  connection between the real world and the virtual world. Right? Right. So

286
00:18:01,805 --> 00:18:05,765
Speaker 5:  I've got windows, safari windows are open all around me. It's not like

287
00:18:05,765 --> 00:18:08,445
Speaker 5:  I'm, they're sticking to the walls. Like they're just like floating all around

288
00:18:08,445 --> 00:18:11,565
Speaker 5:  me and then that bubble can move through the pass through. That's, it's weird,

289
00:18:11,785 --> 00:18:14,845
Speaker 5:  but it, you know, like yeah, that's mixed reality and that's what most people

290
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:18,605
Speaker 5:  are familiar with and that's a lot of this, the three AR features

291
00:18:18,635 --> 00:18:22,245
Speaker 5:  I've seen so far in the vision pro, two of which I think are historically

292
00:18:22,245 --> 00:18:25,925
Speaker 5:  important, like should go down as footnotes in the history of AR one. When

293
00:18:26,165 --> 00:18:30,045
Speaker 5:  you open a Mac laptop and you look at it and it's your laptop and your

294
00:18:30,045 --> 00:18:33,525
Speaker 5:  iCloud, a button floats above the screen that says connect.

295
00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:34,765
Speaker 2:  Oh that's awesome. Oh that's

296
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:38,045
Speaker 5:  Cool. And you can, you can just reach out and push it and then your MAC display

297
00:18:38,045 --> 00:18:40,485
Speaker 5:  mirrors into the Vision Pro. Incredible. That rules

298
00:18:40,825 --> 00:18:41,045
Speaker 2:  Two,

299
00:18:41,115 --> 00:18:45,005
Speaker 5:  When you are typing on a Bluetooth keyboard and you look down, it knows where

300
00:18:45,005 --> 00:18:48,325
Speaker 5:  the keyboard is and it puts a text preview window above it so you can look

301
00:18:48,325 --> 00:18:50,565
Speaker 5:  at your fingers typing on the keys and see what's being typed.

302
00:18:50,905 --> 00:18:54,165
Speaker 2:  Oh. So instead of having the text box like way up here while you're looking

303
00:18:54,165 --> 00:18:56,965
Speaker 2:  down at the keyboard, it brings the text box down to the keyboard. Right.

304
00:18:56,965 --> 00:19:00,405
Speaker 5:  I've got a big Google doc up there, I'm typing away and I look down at the

305
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:03,845
Speaker 5:  keyboard and I can see what I'm typing. So I don't have to like move my head

306
00:19:03,845 --> 00:19:07,525
Speaker 5:  around. Clever. And it, it positions that box correctly near the keyboard

307
00:19:07,705 --> 00:19:11,605
Speaker 5:  and it shows you what you're typing. That is a true AR feature, right? Yeah.

308
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:14,525
Speaker 5:  There's a connection between what I'm doing in the real world and a connection

309
00:19:14,525 --> 00:19:17,685
Speaker 5:  in the virtual world and they've made, and that is amazing. Again, I think

310
00:19:17,685 --> 00:19:21,405
Speaker 5:  these are like the first mainstream AR features to ever ship

311
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,845
Speaker 5:  historic. The third one that I've seen is the loading screen for Super

312
00:19:25,845 --> 00:19:29,245
Speaker 5:  Fruit Ninja where you can throw a strawberry at a pig that's running around

313
00:19:29,245 --> 00:19:32,645
Speaker 5:  your floor that is not even shipping yet. I only saw that in a demo

314
00:19:33,275 --> 00:19:36,885
Speaker 5:  that Apple gave me. It, it feels less historic. I'm just gonna say don don't

315
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,045
Speaker 5:  think that is quite as historic.

316
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:42,405
Speaker 2:  I feel like this is true erasure of the thing where I can put an IKEA couch

317
00:19:42,905 --> 00:19:44,805
Speaker 2:  in my living room through my iPad,

318
00:19:45,065 --> 00:19:47,725
Speaker 5:  But that's what Apple has been demoing forever. Right?

319
00:19:47,725 --> 00:19:51,445
Speaker 2:  I know. It's the only feature idea anyone has ever had until

320
00:19:51,635 --> 00:19:52,125
Speaker 2:  this thing

321
00:19:52,385 --> 00:19:55,085
Speaker 5:  And it's, it's just not here. And I asked and you know, they're like, game

322
00:19:55,085 --> 00:19:58,365
Speaker 5:  developers are working on this. Like, you know, the most charitable read

323
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:01,645
Speaker 5:  of this thing is this is a developer kit. Yeah. And so they're gonna build

324
00:20:01,645 --> 00:20:04,605
Speaker 5:  all these and they're, and they're yet to come and, and I think that you,

325
00:20:04,665 --> 00:20:06,645
Speaker 5:  if you wanna be really fair to this thing, that's how you think about it.

326
00:20:06,825 --> 00:20:10,525
Speaker 5:  But Apple's positioning everything, the thing they're asking it to do, the

327
00:20:10,665 --> 00:20:13,205
Speaker 5:  ad they put out is like people wearing it while they're just like hanging

328
00:20:13,205 --> 00:20:16,645
Speaker 5:  out doing laundry and a call comes in and you're like, what is the value

329
00:20:16,645 --> 00:20:20,005
Speaker 5:  of wearing this if it's not doing anything for you? And the value should

330
00:20:20,005 --> 00:20:23,765
Speaker 5:  be a bunch of AR stuff, not, I'm waiting for the phone to ring and I, there's

331
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:27,325
Speaker 5:  again, there's a real tension between the ambition of the product and how

332
00:20:27,325 --> 00:20:29,245
Speaker 5:  it's being communicated and the reality of the product.

333
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,165
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Okay. That's good. So, and I think this is related and we've kind of

334
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:34,645
Speaker 2:  halfway answered it, but the next one I had written down here is the pass

335
00:20:34,645 --> 00:20:36,205
Speaker 2:  through. Is it good?

336
00:20:36,705 --> 00:20:39,845
Speaker 5:  It is as good as any pass through can ever be and I think pass through is

337
00:20:39,845 --> 00:20:40,245
Speaker 5:  a dead end.

338
00:20:40,555 --> 00:20:44,125
Speaker 2:  Okay. That's essentially what I wanted you to say. And this is where, this

339
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:47,565
Speaker 2:  is where we get into questions about like optical AR and the question of

340
00:20:47,565 --> 00:20:49,965
Speaker 2:  like what are these things supposed to look like in the future? And one of

341
00:20:49,965 --> 00:20:53,445
Speaker 2:  your hobby horses, which you've talked about a lot on this podcast, is like

342
00:20:53,765 --> 00:20:57,485
Speaker 2:  a VR headset might be the wrong direction for this because eventually if

343
00:20:57,485 --> 00:21:00,565
Speaker 2:  it's gonna be glasses you're gonna have things like peripheral vision and

344
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:03,285
Speaker 2:  light is gonna be able to get in from the outside. So like even the best

345
00:21:03,685 --> 00:21:07,285
Speaker 2:  possible version of this thing we're trying to do is not the thing.

346
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:10,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And and it doesn't seem like using this has changed your mind on that

347
00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:10,485
Speaker 2:  at all.

348
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:14,685
Speaker 5:  It's displays and cameras. Yeah. So you've got a thing over your head and

349
00:21:14,685 --> 00:21:17,485
Speaker 5:  then there's a camera looking at the world for you and it's showing it on

350
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:21,165
Speaker 5:  display and that just, you already, if you are a Vergecast listener,

351
00:21:21,465 --> 00:21:25,325
Speaker 5:  you already know a bunch of stuff about cameras in displays just by osmosis

352
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,365
Speaker 5:  from being around the show story. Yeah.

353
00:21:26,365 --> 00:21:26,565
Speaker 2:  We're so

354
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:29,445
Speaker 5:  Sorry. In low light, what does a camera have to do? It has to increase the

355
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,685
Speaker 5:  ISO or increase the shutter speed. They can increase the shutter speed because

356
00:21:32,685 --> 00:21:36,605
Speaker 5:  they need the latency to be so low. So you can tell what it's doing is really

357
00:21:36,605 --> 00:21:40,365
Speaker 5:  ramping ISO and then doing a bunch of noise reduction. So in low light things

358
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:44,325
Speaker 5:  just get, the world is less sharp. I walked into my bathroom wearing

359
00:21:44,325 --> 00:21:46,645
Speaker 5:  the sue day and turned around and I couldn't find the light switch.

360
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:47,405
Speaker 2:  Oh wow.

361
00:21:47,535 --> 00:21:49,845
Speaker 5:  Right. Wow. It was just like too dark in there for me to see the light switch.

362
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:51,765
Speaker 5:  I took the thing off and I was like, well there's lights, you know, it's

363
00:21:51,765 --> 00:21:55,325
Speaker 5:  like, so there's a thing that happens there. It is incredible. Pastor again,

364
00:21:55,385 --> 00:21:58,365
Speaker 5:  it is the best that has ever been done on a consumer device. It is the best

365
00:21:58,365 --> 00:22:02,285
Speaker 5:  that most people ever experienced. Alex don don't know about the, the Varrio

366
00:22:02,285 --> 00:22:05,205
Speaker 5:  headset that you've talked about, but Addie is familiar with it. She was

367
00:22:05,205 --> 00:22:08,045
Speaker 5:  my editor on this. She's like, you know, it's an enterprise product. It's

368
00:22:08,045 --> 00:22:11,445
Speaker 5:  way more expensive. Like so for a consumer headset, this is definitely the,

369
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:14,325
Speaker 5:  the best pass through it has ever shipped. It might be better than the varrio,

370
00:22:14,325 --> 00:22:17,925
Speaker 5:  you know, probably, but the VA is like aimed it enterprise application. It's

371
00:22:17,925 --> 00:22:21,725
Speaker 5:  just like a different thing for a consumer product. This thing is the best

372
00:22:21,785 --> 00:22:25,485
Speaker 5:  you will get and it can do things that no other

373
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:29,005
Speaker 5:  password I've ever seen can do. I can just use my phone with no blooming.

374
00:22:29,005 --> 00:22:32,845
Speaker 5:  Like apple's HDR video processing capabilities are incredible

375
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:35,965
Speaker 5:  and they're doing it in real time at 12 milliseconds of latency. So

376
00:22:37,885 --> 00:22:41,525
Speaker 5:  stunning technical achievement. You're asking it to replace reality.

377
00:22:41,525 --> 00:22:45,285
Speaker 5:  You've set the bar so high that like, I don't know that it can be

378
00:22:45,285 --> 00:22:49,205
Speaker 5:  crossed. I can't sit here and imagine how you could make cameras and screens

379
00:22:50,045 --> 00:22:53,805
Speaker 5:  overcome their limitations. It like a real way. Like maybe noise

380
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:57,925
Speaker 5:  reduction can get even better but you have to make it 50 times better

381
00:22:58,385 --> 00:23:01,885
Speaker 5:  for this to substitute for reality. Yeah. And So I, there's just, when I

382
00:23:01,885 --> 00:23:05,645
Speaker 5:  say it's a dead end, it's like this is as good as anyone has ever done it

383
00:23:06,505 --> 00:23:10,405
Speaker 5:  and it feels like optical AR is still the thing you want where light

384
00:23:10,405 --> 00:23:14,325
Speaker 5:  is just passing through some glasses, some lenses and they're, the screens

385
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:16,765
Speaker 5:  are being put over it And that's really hard. And I think there's a reason

386
00:23:16,765 --> 00:23:18,725
Speaker 5:  Apple shipped this 'cause no one has gotten there yet.

387
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:22,485
Speaker 2:  There was some technology not that long ago, I think it might've been self-driving

388
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:26,125
Speaker 2:  cars that somebody described as like really amazing and three physics

389
00:23:26,245 --> 00:23:30,005
Speaker 2:  miracles away from being possible. And I feel like there's some of that in

390
00:23:30,005 --> 00:23:33,165
Speaker 2:  here too that it's like the things that we're doing here are incredible and

391
00:23:33,165 --> 00:23:36,485
Speaker 2:  we fundamentally have to change the laws of the universe in order to get

392
00:23:36,485 --> 00:23:38,645
Speaker 2:  to the next thing after this. Yeah.

393
00:23:38,715 --> 00:23:41,885
Speaker 5:  That, that feels, that feels correct with this device. It's

394
00:23:41,885 --> 00:23:42,125
Speaker 2:  Kinda like

395
00:23:42,405 --> 00:23:42,845
Speaker 7:  Robotics, right?

396
00:23:43,115 --> 00:23:43,965
Speaker 2:  Yeah, totally. Where you're

397
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:47,605
Speaker 6:  Always expecting the, the robot to walk like a human. But actually

398
00:23:47,745 --> 00:23:49,365
Speaker 6:  humans are really well made

399
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:53,845
Speaker 5:  For that thing. Humans are not well made for mounting hardware on like a

400
00:23:53,845 --> 00:23:54,885
Speaker 5:  VR headset on your face.

401
00:23:55,405 --> 00:23:57,885
Speaker 2:  I have found myself wondering, in talking to you about this thing many times

402
00:23:58,065 --> 00:24:02,045
Speaker 2:  who the like platonic ideal of the vision pro wearer is and like

403
00:24:02,045 --> 00:24:05,565
Speaker 2:  what the measurements of their face are. 'cause you know there is like, there

404
00:24:05,565 --> 00:24:08,965
Speaker 2:  is a head in there that is like just crushing it with the vision Pro

405
00:24:09,055 --> 00:24:12,325
Speaker 5:  Apple, you know, apple like measures everyone ears to make the AirPods. I

406
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:15,565
Speaker 5:  asked if there was a maximum head size. Okay and I was told

407
00:24:16,265 --> 00:24:18,965
Speaker 5:  we have not considered that, but there is a maximum hair size.

408
00:24:19,985 --> 00:24:20,205
Speaker 6:  Wow.

409
00:24:20,795 --> 00:24:22,605
Speaker 2:  It's Craig. If you have bigger hair than Craig,

410
00:24:22,945 --> 00:24:26,725
Speaker 5:  It is like very, it's not like a small, it is very large, but there is some

411
00:24:26,725 --> 00:24:27,965
Speaker 5:  sort of maximum hair size.

412
00:24:28,225 --> 00:24:32,165
Speaker 2:  We have to find the maximum hair size. This is now the first cat's main

413
00:24:32,165 --> 00:24:35,845
Speaker 2:  goal. All right, let's keep going Audio, which I think is a sneakily

414
00:24:35,845 --> 00:24:39,445
Speaker 2:  important and kind of underused feature of all of these headsets.

415
00:24:39,965 --> 00:24:40,645
Speaker 2:  Is it good?

416
00:24:40,955 --> 00:24:44,805
Speaker 5:  It's great. No, no complaints. It is very loud. The spacial stuff is

417
00:24:44,805 --> 00:24:48,445
Speaker 5:  really cool when you push the window. I watched the NFC championship game

418
00:24:48,785 --> 00:24:52,365
Speaker 5:  on YouTube TV and the browser on the, on the thing last night and as I pushed

419
00:24:52,385 --> 00:24:55,845
Speaker 5:  the browser window away, the Detroit lions got farther and farther away from

420
00:24:55,845 --> 00:24:59,805
Speaker 5:  me. You know, like that's cool. It is very loud. Everyone around you

421
00:24:59,805 --> 00:25:02,765
Speaker 5:  can hear what you're doing. So if you are in a public place, you should wear

422
00:25:02,765 --> 00:25:06,285
Speaker 5:  the air. You should in particular, you should wear second generation AirPods

423
00:25:06,285 --> 00:25:09,605
Speaker 5:  Pro. You can use any Bluetooth headphones you want. But the second generation

424
00:25:09,605 --> 00:25:13,285
Speaker 5:  AirPods Pro get all of the features so they get spatial audio, they get lower

425
00:25:13,285 --> 00:25:17,245
Speaker 5:  latency, they get 48 kilohertz. Like you just want to use those also

426
00:25:17,245 --> 00:25:20,965
Speaker 2:  Feels like the right, you don't want big headphones with these like you don't

427
00:25:20,965 --> 00:25:24,445
Speaker 2:  need more weight on your head as you're wearing grow. Yeah. Okay. But in

428
00:25:24,445 --> 00:25:27,405
Speaker 2:  but no, no notes. You're a guy who cares deeply about this stuff. You're,

429
00:25:27,405 --> 00:25:29,285
Speaker 2:  you're good with spatial audio, you're happy about this?

430
00:25:29,675 --> 00:25:33,525
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I mean I, I'm sure if I had more time in sleep I

431
00:25:33,525 --> 00:25:35,605
Speaker 5:  would have notes on the audio but no, no notes.

432
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:38,485
Speaker 2:  Everyone has just been sneaking up on you for several days now.

433
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:42,525
Speaker 5:  But again, there's not, again because there's not a lot of AR experiences

434
00:25:42,545 --> 00:25:46,285
Speaker 5:  or even VR experiences, that thing hasn't happened. It's just windows

435
00:25:46,465 --> 00:25:49,765
Speaker 5:  are playing audio at you. I was on a FaceTime call with Joanna and Marquez

436
00:25:49,765 --> 00:25:50,925
Speaker 5:  so we could look at personas and

437
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:56,645
Speaker 5:  boy and they, their PS three characters sounded like

438
00:25:56,795 --> 00:25:59,445
Speaker 5:  they were talking to me from where they were, which is cool.

439
00:25:59,755 --> 00:26:00,845
Speaker 6:  Part of that is really cool.

440
00:26:00,995 --> 00:26:03,365
Speaker 2:  Alright, one more and then we're gonna take a break and then we're gonna

441
00:26:03,365 --> 00:26:07,285
Speaker 2:  get into some of the like how you use this thing stuff. Battery life, is

442
00:26:07,285 --> 00:26:07,605
Speaker 2:  it good?

443
00:26:07,895 --> 00:26:11,285
Speaker 5:  Irrelevant. That's my answer. It's why it's fine.

444
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:15,085
Speaker 5:  It's two and a half hours. Okay. We haven't had a chance to like do a battery

445
00:26:15,085 --> 00:26:18,045
Speaker 5:  rundown. I'm not even sure that I would wanna subject anyone to do a battery

446
00:26:18,045 --> 00:26:21,445
Speaker 5:  rundown. And that's what I mean it by, it's irrelevant if you are in this

447
00:26:21,445 --> 00:26:25,205
Speaker 5:  thing for two and a half hours, boy are you gonna feel it? I can't. I just,

448
00:26:25,485 --> 00:26:29,085
Speaker 5:  I personally cannot imagine a situation where you want to be in it for that

449
00:26:29,085 --> 00:26:32,965
Speaker 5:  long. I know Joanna wore it for like 20 hours straight

450
00:26:32,965 --> 00:26:35,965
Speaker 5:  or whatever. She did some enormous, the don don't know what the actual number

451
00:26:35,965 --> 00:26:39,645
Speaker 5:  is 'cause I, as we are recording this, I have not read her review, but when

452
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:42,045
Speaker 5:  I had talked to her on that FaceTime call, she'd been wearing it for five

453
00:26:42,045 --> 00:26:44,885
Speaker 5:  hours. Oh boy. Wow. And I'm very worried. I love her to pieces. She's one

454
00:26:44,885 --> 00:26:48,125
Speaker 5:  of the very closest friends. I'm so worried about her. I just can't imagine

455
00:26:48,325 --> 00:26:52,245
Speaker 5:  a situation where you want to hit the battery life and

456
00:26:52,245 --> 00:26:55,165
Speaker 5:  then because it is so stationary you're, it feels like it'll be close to

457
00:26:55,165 --> 00:26:58,005
Speaker 5:  power. Now the one situation where you, I could see it being a problem is

458
00:26:58,005 --> 00:27:01,925
Speaker 5:  a plane. Hmm. But then you're sitting so you can just like plug in a battery

459
00:27:02,075 --> 00:27:02,805
Speaker 5:  like you'll be fine.

460
00:27:03,065 --> 00:27:05,605
Speaker 2:  Can you hot swap the batteries? That's a question. We've gotten a bunch.

461
00:27:06,185 --> 00:27:09,965
Speaker 5:  You cannot hot swap the batteries. The batteries are, it's a mechanical

462
00:27:09,975 --> 00:27:13,845
Speaker 5:  twist connector. It's very satisfying. It's like a big cyber decky

463
00:27:13,845 --> 00:27:17,165
Speaker 5:  twist connector, you know, and it lights up. The battery is a motion sensor

464
00:27:17,225 --> 00:27:20,245
Speaker 5:  so when you pick it up, the light glows green or orange. It's a very apple.

465
00:27:20,245 --> 00:27:22,645
Speaker 5:  There's no button to tell you the battery status. It has a motion sensor.

466
00:27:22,715 --> 00:27:26,565
Speaker 5:  Sure at 34 99 you can do anything. So

467
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:29,485
Speaker 5:  it just picks up and glows. But you can't hot swap it from the headset itself.

468
00:27:29,485 --> 00:27:31,565
Speaker 5:  You can just plug another battery into it over USBC.

469
00:27:31,835 --> 00:27:34,165
Speaker 2:  Alright, let's take a quick break and then we're gonna come back and talk

470
00:27:34,165 --> 00:27:36,445
Speaker 2:  about the bunch of ways you actually use this thing. We'll be right back.

471
00:31:00,475 --> 00:31:04,375
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Next one on my list. I think we should get into the

472
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:08,295
Speaker 2:  like life inside of the headset thing. And I, I feel like there are two big

473
00:31:08,705 --> 00:31:12,575
Speaker 2:  parts of the how you use this thing that really

474
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:16,135
Speaker 2:  sort of define whether this thing is gonna work or not. I guess the, the

475
00:31:16,135 --> 00:31:19,535
Speaker 2:  first one is, is the eye tracking. So eye tracking is it good?

476
00:31:19,885 --> 00:31:22,095
Speaker 5:  It's as good as anyone has ever shipped. Eye tracking.

477
00:31:23,755 --> 00:31:26,415
Speaker 2:  I'm just gonna start playing that for myself. At the beginning of every one

478
00:31:26,415 --> 00:31:27,255
Speaker 2:  of these answers, which

479
00:31:27,255 --> 00:31:30,215
Speaker 6:  Version of Toby does it really like perfectly replicate.

480
00:31:30,995 --> 00:31:32,135
Speaker 2:  That's Toby with two eyes.

481
00:31:34,035 --> 00:31:37,615
Speaker 5:  It is the best eye tracking that anyone has ever shipped. Yeah, I It's not

482
00:31:37,615 --> 00:31:41,215
Speaker 5:  good enough Ooh. This is, I like, I'm just gonna keep coming back to this

483
00:31:41,515 --> 00:31:44,535
Speaker 5:  and it's gonna be frustrating until you use it.

484
00:31:45,285 --> 00:31:49,135
Speaker 5:  It's the best, the first time you use it until you use it. It's hard to even

485
00:31:49,135 --> 00:31:53,095
Speaker 5:  for me to explain what I'm talking about. Yeah. The

486
00:31:53,095 --> 00:31:56,415
Speaker 5:  first time you put it on and we, you know, so many of us have had that demo,

487
00:31:57,045 --> 00:32:00,375
Speaker 5:  it's magic. You look at stuff, it highlights,

488
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,055
Speaker 5:  you click your fingers together. If you get it wrong, you're like, oh, you

489
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:05,975
Speaker 5:  just have to get used to it. Right? Like that's the experience that you have

490
00:32:05,995 --> 00:32:07,335
Speaker 5:  in that first demo. The idea

491
00:32:07,335 --> 00:32:11,055
Speaker 2:  Is basically like where your eyes focus is a

492
00:32:11,055 --> 00:32:13,655
Speaker 2:  cursor is sort of the way to think about it, right? And you're sort of moving

493
00:32:13,655 --> 00:32:17,615
Speaker 2:  that cursor around with your gaze and you look

494
00:32:17,615 --> 00:32:20,655
Speaker 2:  at a button in order to be able to click on that button, right? Is that like,

495
00:32:20,655 --> 00:32:23,055
Speaker 2:  is that a reasonable way to think about the metaphor there? Yeah.

496
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:26,575
Speaker 5:  You know how the iPad cursor kind of snaps it's that.

497
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:30,295
Speaker 5:  Okay. Right. So you just sort of like if buttons are big and you look in

498
00:32:30,295 --> 00:32:31,455
Speaker 5:  a general error, they will highlight.

499
00:32:31,515 --> 00:32:32,295
Speaker 2:  Oh, I see. Okay.

500
00:32:32,935 --> 00:32:36,775
Speaker 5:  Fascinating thing about this is one, I think Vision OS

501
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,325
Speaker 5:  is designed for eye tracking that is slightly more precise than it actually

502
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:43,085
Speaker 5:  is. Like that's how it feels. Ooh it probably isn't. It's probably designed

503
00:32:43,085 --> 00:32:44,965
Speaker 5:  to be exactly as it's apple, right? Meaning

504
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:47,205
Speaker 2:  Like the buttons are like a little too small and a little too close

505
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:51,245
Speaker 5:  Together. Yeah. I'll just give you one super dumb example. The keyboard

506
00:32:51,425 --> 00:32:55,405
Speaker 5:  is like ridiculous. Like it's just a fully rid, like they needed

507
00:32:55,405 --> 00:32:58,205
Speaker 5:  to have a keyboard and it's there, but there's no way they want you to use

508
00:32:58,205 --> 00:33:01,365
Speaker 5:  that keyboard for any serious text input. The keys are too close together.

509
00:33:01,585 --> 00:33:05,165
Speaker 5:  So you're like sitting there trying to look from one letter to another and

510
00:33:05,165 --> 00:33:08,725
Speaker 5:  you're just like, I hate, I hate this. And then you just give up and you

511
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:12,525
Speaker 5:  like dictate to Siri or you connect a regular keyboard and you use that keyboard.

512
00:33:12,525 --> 00:33:15,965
Speaker 5:  There's no way you should use that keyboard. And part of it is that it is

513
00:33:15,965 --> 00:33:19,165
Speaker 5:  just funda. It's fundamentally ridiculous. Part of it is like the, the buttons

514
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:22,605
Speaker 5:  are close, too close together and you will sit there trying to look from

515
00:33:22,605 --> 00:33:26,525
Speaker 5:  the E to the R and the system just like won't let you. And

516
00:33:26,525 --> 00:33:29,805
Speaker 5:  I've never looked at a letter as hard as I've tried to look at a letter

517
00:33:30,305 --> 00:33:32,445
Speaker 5:  and be like, I'm looking at it man. Brain

518
00:33:32,785 --> 00:33:34,605
Speaker 2:  Is saying like RRR.

519
00:33:34,715 --> 00:33:37,805
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And the sometimes the easiest thing to do is to look completely away

520
00:33:37,805 --> 00:33:41,685
Speaker 5:  and try again. Right? And maybe the thing is like, you know, I can't

521
00:33:41,885 --> 00:33:45,725
Speaker 5:  quantify it. Maybe it's 99% accurate, but

522
00:33:45,725 --> 00:33:48,125
Speaker 5:  that 1% just like ends it, but it

523
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:51,685
Speaker 6:  Doesn't like wiggle. Like Toby would sometimes kind of wiggle.

524
00:33:52,065 --> 00:33:53,925
Speaker 6:  It wouldn't quite register your eye.

525
00:33:54,195 --> 00:33:57,765
Speaker 5:  It's the best eye tracking that has ever been shipped. This is what I'm saying.

526
00:33:58,155 --> 00:34:01,805
Speaker 5:  This is the best anyone has ever done it. Yeah. Without question. It's the

527
00:34:01,805 --> 00:34:05,725
Speaker 5:  best anyone's ever done it. And you know, a keyboard on a computer is a

528
00:34:05,725 --> 00:34:09,405
Speaker 5:  hundred percent precise, right? Right. You push a button, that

529
00:34:09,405 --> 00:34:13,365
Speaker 5:  button is pushed every single time. Multitouch iPhone is actually not

530
00:34:13,365 --> 00:34:16,965
Speaker 5:  a hundred percent precise. There's a lot of algorithmic work happening to

531
00:34:16,965 --> 00:34:20,925
Speaker 5:  make a touchscreen appear to be a hundred percent precise. Like a lot

532
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:24,165
Speaker 5:  of work has happened over the past decade to make those touchscreens feel

533
00:34:24,165 --> 00:34:27,765
Speaker 5:  even more precise. But they appear to you to be a hundred percent precise.

534
00:34:28,145 --> 00:34:31,805
Speaker 5:  And when they are not, like when autocorrect fails, which is an experience

535
00:34:31,965 --> 00:34:35,805
Speaker 5:  everyone has, you are utterly frustrated, right? When when a touchscreen

536
00:34:35,805 --> 00:34:39,645
Speaker 5:  goes dead and you're jabbing at a button, it doesn't do anything. Whew. That's

537
00:34:39,645 --> 00:34:42,925
Speaker 5:  awful. Right? That's the worst. That's the worst. But most of the time a

538
00:34:42,925 --> 00:34:46,325
Speaker 5:  touchscreen appears to be a hundred percent like direct input control. Your

539
00:34:46,675 --> 00:34:50,565
Speaker 5:  eyes are bad that like you are just constantly

540
00:34:50,565 --> 00:34:53,645
Speaker 5:  looking at stuff that you don't wanna look at, right? Yeah. Or like you're

541
00:34:53,645 --> 00:34:56,725
Speaker 5:  looking at the biggest thing instead of, well the play button is the biggest

542
00:34:56,725 --> 00:35:00,085
Speaker 5:  thing in a video player. And I constantly wanna push the plus 10 seconds,

543
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:03,325
Speaker 5:  but my eyes are like, look at how big that play button is. And so I'm just

544
00:35:03,325 --> 00:35:06,325
Speaker 5:  looking at the wrong thing. And that is, it's the best anyone's ever done

545
00:35:06,325 --> 00:35:10,045
Speaker 5:  it. And it went Addie's line was It works until it

546
00:35:10,045 --> 00:35:13,405
Speaker 5:  doesn't. Mm. Right. And my version of that is it feels like magic until it

547
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:16,525
Speaker 5:  is not. Yeah. And there's, it's just a binary So I

548
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,925
Speaker 5:  this connects to hand tracking, which I think is your next question probably.

549
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:23,845
Speaker 5:  Yeah. The hand tracking is exactly the same way. It's magic until it is not.

550
00:35:24,385 --> 00:35:27,405
Speaker 5:  And particularly where it's not is when it can't see your hands,

551
00:35:28,095 --> 00:35:30,565
Speaker 5:  which, like, I'm just sitting at a table right now. If I just had my hands

552
00:35:30,585 --> 00:35:34,565
Speaker 5:  in my, my lap, it couldn't see my hands. This is a ridiculous complaint.

553
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:38,365
Speaker 5:  The hand tracking system needs to see your hands. No other computer stops

554
00:35:38,365 --> 00:35:39,725
Speaker 5:  working if it can't see your hands.

555
00:35:41,675 --> 00:35:45,245
Speaker 5:  Like, like if you want this to be a primary computing device like your hand,

556
00:35:45,305 --> 00:35:48,285
Speaker 5:  it has to be able to see your hands. If I, if you're just standing up and

557
00:35:48,285 --> 00:35:51,725
Speaker 5:  your hands are by your sides and if you're like me, they kind of like fall

558
00:35:51,725 --> 00:35:55,645
Speaker 5:  behind you, it stops working. And so like it's the

559
00:35:55,805 --> 00:35:58,965
Speaker 5:  best it's ever been shipped without question. It is the best it's ever been

560
00:35:58,965 --> 00:36:02,805
Speaker 5:  shipped it. It just hits the wall of reality, which is the thing

561
00:36:02,805 --> 00:36:06,125
Speaker 5:  is not actually your eyes and your hands are not actually controlling this

562
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:09,655
Speaker 5:  device. Cameras are watching your hands in your eyes

563
00:36:10,015 --> 00:36:13,935
Speaker 5:  interpreting them and turning that into input. And that interpretation

564
00:36:14,515 --> 00:36:15,255
Speaker 5:  has real limits.

565
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:19,375
Speaker 6:  So like to keep it fully functional at all times, you have to kinda like

566
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:21,095
Speaker 6:  keep your hands up at all

567
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:24,335
Speaker 5:  Times. No, it's a pretty big bubble around you. Okay. So like, if you are,

568
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:28,255
Speaker 5:  it's basically like if you slice your body in half, it's the plane of the

569
00:36:28,255 --> 00:36:32,175
Speaker 5:  body in front of you, like all the way around. So if you're sitting

570
00:36:32,195 --> 00:36:35,215
Speaker 5:  on a couch and you got a hand over the side of the couch, it mostly works

571
00:36:35,675 --> 00:36:39,535
Speaker 5:  If you are anywhere, anywhere, I can see your hands basically. Okay.

572
00:36:39,535 --> 00:36:43,135
Speaker 5:  But if you, if it's really dark and you are lying down

573
00:36:43,515 --> 00:36:47,135
Speaker 5:  and the IR flood lights in the front can't sort of like reach down and see

574
00:36:47,135 --> 00:36:50,415
Speaker 5:  your hands and light them up, the cameras can't see your hands. So then you

575
00:36:50,415 --> 00:36:54,055
Speaker 5:  can't use it. It's like you're, you're just gonna find all of these places

576
00:36:54,705 --> 00:36:57,695
Speaker 5:  where like if you are meant to wear this thing all the time, the, they will

577
00:36:57,695 --> 00:37:01,455
Speaker 5:  come up more than you think. But in most uses it feels like magic.

578
00:37:01,455 --> 00:37:05,295
Speaker 5:  Right? It's this line of it is absolutely magic until it is not. Oh, and

579
00:37:05,295 --> 00:37:08,055
Speaker 5:  then the other thing that's funny is that it is always using your hands as

580
00:37:08,055 --> 00:37:08,855
Speaker 5:  input. This is

581
00:37:08,855 --> 00:37:11,935
Speaker 2:  What I was about to ask about, like, have you had to train yourself to be

582
00:37:12,025 --> 00:37:15,975
Speaker 2:  aware of your eyes and hands in ways that you wouldn't be? Yes. Otherwise.

583
00:37:16,005 --> 00:37:19,815
Speaker 2:  Like you, anyone who has ever watched The Vergecast on YouTube knows

584
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:23,815
Speaker 2:  NELI, never ever, ever stops moving his hands. You touch the mics, you're

585
00:37:23,815 --> 00:37:25,895
Speaker 2:  moving around, you're gesturing at stuff, you're pointing at Yes. Things

586
00:37:25,895 --> 00:37:29,495
Speaker 2:  you're, you're like, are you like aware of these parts of your body

587
00:37:29,675 --> 00:37:31,575
Speaker 2:  in new ways after using these devices?

588
00:37:32,195 --> 00:37:36,095
Speaker 5:  Yes. In particular, you have to sit still. When I write scripts for a decoder

589
00:37:36,095 --> 00:37:40,015
Speaker 5:  or for video reviews like this, I talk as I write to make sure I

590
00:37:40,015 --> 00:37:43,975
Speaker 5:  can read what I'm writing and it sounds good and flows. And I move my hands

591
00:37:43,975 --> 00:37:47,895
Speaker 5:  when I talk. And I was just scrolling all over the place by accident, just

592
00:37:47,895 --> 00:37:51,615
Speaker 5:  whipping windows around for no reason, just clicking on stuff. And I was

593
00:37:51,615 --> 00:37:54,535
Speaker 5:  like, oh I gotta, I gotta keep my hands still. Some people do not secret

594
00:37:54,535 --> 00:37:56,615
Speaker 5:  their hands. This is a very personalized complaint. But if you do, you're

595
00:37:56,615 --> 00:37:59,975
Speaker 5:  gonna notice you have to sit still unless you want to do something. And then

596
00:37:59,975 --> 00:38:03,775
Speaker 5:  the other thing is that you have to get used to the

597
00:38:03,845 --> 00:38:07,655
Speaker 5:  control being linked to your eyes. And that is not how you use a

598
00:38:07,775 --> 00:38:10,455
Speaker 5:  computer. How many times have you looked at something on screen and just

599
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:13,295
Speaker 5:  banged around the arrow keys to get around without looking at the arrow keys

600
00:38:13,295 --> 00:38:17,055
Speaker 5:  constantly all the time on the Vision Pro you have to go

601
00:38:17,085 --> 00:38:20,215
Speaker 5:  look right. Right. That, and that's just like the simplest example on a phone

602
00:38:20,225 --> 00:38:23,095
Speaker 5:  where you know there's a little bit more collapse between what you're looking

603
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:26,735
Speaker 5:  at in the controls. How many times do I opened Lightroom and like move to

604
00:38:26,735 --> 00:38:29,975
Speaker 5:  slider back and forth while looking at the photo to see how the brightness

605
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:33,135
Speaker 5:  is changing or whatever. On the Vision Pro, you gotta look at that brightness

606
00:38:33,135 --> 00:38:35,325
Speaker 5:  slider. Weird. Weird.

607
00:38:35,915 --> 00:38:39,845
Speaker 6:  Does it feel like that friction could ever go away for you? Like at

608
00:38:39,845 --> 00:38:43,805
Speaker 6:  some point you could see yourself doing it more naturally and it's just you've

609
00:38:43,805 --> 00:38:44,605
Speaker 6:  had five days with it.

610
00:38:44,715 --> 00:38:47,405
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I've had five days with it. You know, I've asked Apple about this particular

611
00:38:47,405 --> 00:38:51,125
Speaker 5:  thing. This is a big philosophical needy design. Yeah. Question, right? Yeah.

612
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:54,925
Speaker 5:  Like should the control of the thing be directly linked to what you're looking

613
00:38:54,925 --> 00:38:58,485
Speaker 5:  at? Or should those things be disconnected? And so, you know, obviously

614
00:38:59,065 --> 00:39:02,045
Speaker 5:  I'm, I'm asking this, I'm just wandering the streets being like, what is

615
00:39:02,045 --> 00:39:05,485
Speaker 5:  the essential nature of input? This is what I love. I love it. I love talking

616
00:39:05,485 --> 00:39:08,045
Speaker 5:  about this stuff. And they're like, you get one, you get used to it and two,

617
00:39:08,755 --> 00:39:12,325
Speaker 5:  that it's not the only input on the system, right? You can connect a Bluetooth

618
00:39:12,645 --> 00:39:16,605
Speaker 5:  keyboard and trackpad, you can use Siri to do all this stuff. Like we want

619
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:20,005
Speaker 5:  to expand the range of computing inputs beyond the mouse and the keyboard.

620
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:24,565
Speaker 5:  And after five days or six days, I'm kind of like, well the mouse and keyboard

621
00:39:24,585 --> 00:39:28,405
Speaker 5:  are historically undefeated. So yeah, good luck. You know,

622
00:39:28,435 --> 00:39:28,725
Speaker 5:  like,

623
00:39:29,365 --> 00:39:33,325
Speaker 2:  I, I agree with that. The one that's missing there is like, I think there's

624
00:39:33,325 --> 00:39:36,325
Speaker 2:  a way of looking at the Vision Pro that is sort of an amalgamation of all

625
00:39:36,325 --> 00:39:39,605
Speaker 2:  of the technology Apple has ever built to do anything all in one device.

626
00:39:39,825 --> 00:39:43,285
Speaker 2:  And the one that it feels like it's missing is multitouch. Like it's, it's

627
00:39:43,285 --> 00:39:46,005
Speaker 2:  surprising to me. Yeah. Given all of the stuff in here that there isn't a

628
00:39:46,005 --> 00:39:49,885
Speaker 2:  way to reach out and touch the buttons on the keyboard to type.

629
00:39:50,225 --> 00:39:52,245
Speaker 5:  You can, you can punch one finger at a time. Oh

630
00:39:52,245 --> 00:39:52,885
Speaker 2:  You can. Oh okay.

631
00:39:52,885 --> 00:39:56,205
Speaker 5:  That makes me feel you can't multitouch. Okay. Right. So it can register

632
00:39:56,465 --> 00:40:00,285
Speaker 5:  big movements of the hands. I want to like, big is the wrong

633
00:40:00,285 --> 00:40:00,485
Speaker 5:  word.

634
00:40:00,545 --> 00:40:02,525
Speaker 2:  So you can type on it like a typewriter kind of.

635
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:06,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah, you can, you can hand pack on a, on a and you look silly and it's

636
00:40:06,325 --> 00:40:08,805
Speaker 5:  slow and it's not a hundred percent accurate. Sure. And like I said that,

637
00:40:09,065 --> 00:40:12,885
Speaker 5:  but you can do that, right? Like we don't have Optic Id

638
00:40:12,985 --> 00:40:16,645
Speaker 5:  set up on ours because other people, like the video team is constantly using

639
00:40:16,645 --> 00:40:19,885
Speaker 5:  it, light it up and all this stuff and so everyone puts it on and they punch

640
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:21,485
Speaker 5:  the code into Oh,

641
00:40:21,645 --> 00:40:22,085
Speaker 2:  Interesting. Okay.

642
00:40:22,085 --> 00:40:25,085
Speaker 5:  Right. Instead of doing the thing. 'cause it's just, it's just a big phone

643
00:40:25,305 --> 00:40:28,045
Speaker 5:  key badge or what looks like a phone keypad shows up in front of you and

644
00:40:28,045 --> 00:40:30,805
Speaker 5:  you're like boop boop boop boop. And it's like very funny to watch everyone

645
00:40:30,805 --> 00:40:31,845
Speaker 5:  do this every time they put it on.

646
00:40:32,035 --> 00:40:35,805
Speaker 2:  Okay. So that is a fallback option. At least makes me feel a little bit better

647
00:40:35,805 --> 00:40:39,765
Speaker 2:  about this. I do think there is a thing that the, the eye tracking, it just

648
00:40:39,835 --> 00:40:43,685
Speaker 2:  adds another step to everything you want to do. Yep. The the

649
00:40:43,685 --> 00:40:47,125
Speaker 2:  example I always give to people is like, your muscle memory knows where all

650
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:50,805
Speaker 2:  the app icons are on your phone. So like if you, if you had to think about

651
00:40:50,805 --> 00:40:53,965
Speaker 2:  looking at an app every single time you wanted to open it, it would be annoying.

652
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:58,125
Speaker 2:  And it's just your, your fingers learn where things are in a way that is

653
00:40:58,125 --> 00:40:59,725
Speaker 2:  useless to you on the Vision Pro.

654
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:02,165
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You have to be looking at things. I'll give you another example actually.

655
00:41:02,165 --> 00:41:05,685
Speaker 5:  The Multi-touch example is a really good one. So a quest where you have

656
00:41:05,885 --> 00:41:09,765
Speaker 5:  controllers and every VR company loves being like, you're

657
00:41:09,765 --> 00:41:13,645
Speaker 5:  a DJ now. They just love it. Didn't, you know, in my twenties I was

658
00:41:13,645 --> 00:41:17,405
Speaker 5:  like, I'm gonna be a DJ feels right if we all, we all go through this period.

659
00:41:17,425 --> 00:41:17,725
Speaker 5:  We all

660
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,485
Speaker 6:  Had that moment and

661
00:41:18,485 --> 00:41:20,725
Speaker 2:  In all subsequent decades, Bila has said those things.

662
00:41:20,755 --> 00:41:24,525
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I'm still a dj, I'm playing tonight at Soundbar. So in the Quest you

663
00:41:24,525 --> 00:41:27,565
Speaker 5:  have controllers in your hands and you like look at Tribe xr, which is the

664
00:41:27,565 --> 00:41:31,285
Speaker 5:  DJ app on the Quest and it's floating in space and you like reach out

665
00:41:31,385 --> 00:41:33,925
Speaker 5:  and it shows your hands, it doesn't show the the controllers and you push

666
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:37,485
Speaker 5:  the button and it looks like you're grabbing the fader and then after a while

667
00:41:37,485 --> 00:41:40,605
Speaker 5:  your brain kind of remaps, you're like, oh I'm actually grabbing this fader.

668
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:44,165
Speaker 5:  I'm actually twisting this knob. And your hands are doing some controller

669
00:41:44,165 --> 00:41:47,685
Speaker 5:  stuff, right? They're just like gripping or pushing the button, the trigger

670
00:41:47,685 --> 00:41:51,565
Speaker 5:  button. but it after your brain just kinda like remaps to that

671
00:41:51,565 --> 00:41:55,525
Speaker 5:  thing. Vision Pro doesn't have that. It's got taps. So you

672
00:41:55,525 --> 00:41:59,485
Speaker 5:  look at a knob and you tap your fingers and drag it the

673
00:41:59,485 --> 00:42:03,005
Speaker 5:  same way you do anything else and it's like, oh I'm not, there's no connection

674
00:42:03,005 --> 00:42:06,925
Speaker 5:  between me physically interacting with this floating deck in dj,

675
00:42:06,925 --> 00:42:10,405
Speaker 5:  which is the Vision Pro version of this. The way that in Tribe xr, it's like

676
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:13,885
Speaker 5:  I've got a controller, I'm pushing buttons on the controller and because

677
00:42:13,885 --> 00:42:17,815
Speaker 5:  something tactile is happening to my hands that looks like something tactile

678
00:42:17,815 --> 00:42:21,595
Speaker 5:  is happening over here. Like my brain is just like rewiring to be

679
00:42:21,595 --> 00:42:24,395
Speaker 5:  convinced that that is actually happening now. Interesting. Now can I DJ

680
00:42:24,495 --> 00:42:26,475
Speaker 5:  in any of these apps? No,

681
00:42:29,155 --> 00:42:32,315
Speaker 5:  Absolutely not. But the Vision Pro is like because you're just tapping your

682
00:42:32,315 --> 00:42:35,355
Speaker 5:  fingers together. It's like you're clicking. The difference is very much

683
00:42:35,465 --> 00:42:39,355
Speaker 5:  between, I would give you the difference is feels very much like the difference

684
00:42:39,355 --> 00:42:42,195
Speaker 5:  between a touchscreen and a mouse. Right? Where a touchscreen feels like

685
00:42:42,195 --> 00:42:44,435
Speaker 5:  you're directly controlling some pixels and a mouse is like I'm clicking

686
00:42:44,435 --> 00:42:45,515
Speaker 5:  on stuff. Okay. So

687
00:42:45,515 --> 00:42:48,835
Speaker 6:  Sort of like when you're on a screen and you're trying to play an old, like

688
00:42:48,835 --> 00:42:52,715
Speaker 6:  a Nintendo game on your phone it feels like garbage. But then younger people

689
00:42:53,095 --> 00:42:56,995
Speaker 6:  are just used to phone screens and so it, they don't hate it as much. They,

690
00:42:56,995 --> 00:42:58,275
Speaker 6:  they can play Fortnite and stuff.

691
00:42:58,345 --> 00:43:01,555
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I watch Max plays Minecraft on her iPad. I'm like how are you doing

692
00:43:01,555 --> 00:43:02,115
Speaker 5:  this? Yeah.

693
00:43:02,415 --> 00:43:03,755
Speaker 6:  So she'll have a great time. Yeah.

694
00:43:03,755 --> 00:43:06,595
Speaker 5:  So may maybe the younger people are gonna live fully in headsets and they're

695
00:43:06,595 --> 00:43:09,955
Speaker 5:  gonna be fun. But it's that, it's that control dynamic is

696
00:43:10,415 --> 00:43:13,675
Speaker 5:  you, you will feel it in a way that, again, I keep saying it is the best

697
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:16,835
Speaker 5:  it has ever been done. Is it good enough? Like I don Dunno, I I don Dunno.

698
00:43:16,875 --> 00:43:20,715
Speaker 5:  I don Dunno if it can ever be, it has to be 50 times better. By the way,

699
00:43:20,715 --> 00:43:24,115
Speaker 5:  can I say this thing please? Because I haven't given this a score yet. So

700
00:43:24,445 --> 00:43:28,155
Speaker 5:  we're gonna spend all night debating the score. I think shipping a

701
00:43:28,155 --> 00:43:32,035
Speaker 5:  $3,500 computer whose default input method is not a hundred

702
00:43:32,035 --> 00:43:35,995
Speaker 5:  percent consistent. That's a full point. Yes. That's a full

703
00:43:35,995 --> 00:43:37,075
Speaker 5:  point, right? A hundred

704
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:40,875
Speaker 2:  Percent. And one out of every a hundred times you hit a key. It just made

705
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:43,355
Speaker 2:  up a different key to do. Yeah. You would not like that keyboard.

706
00:43:43,665 --> 00:43:46,675
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Right. And there's all these other affordances and whatever, but like

707
00:43:46,705 --> 00:43:47,835
Speaker 5:  that feels like a full point.

708
00:43:47,985 --> 00:43:51,915
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Anytime I review an E Ink device, I have to like knock

709
00:43:51,915 --> 00:43:53,875
Speaker 6:  off a point 'cause it's not gonna work all the time.

710
00:43:54,455 --> 00:43:55,155
Speaker 5:  That's brutal.

711
00:43:55,375 --> 00:43:58,395
Speaker 2:  You type three letters and then four seconds later it types two of them and

712
00:43:58,395 --> 00:44:02,195
Speaker 2:  then something else. Okay. Let's get to the, the two main use cases

713
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:05,955
Speaker 2:  that I think we and others have identified for this thing so far. And you

714
00:44:05,955 --> 00:44:09,915
Speaker 2:  should, you should add to this list if there are any obvious big

715
00:44:09,915 --> 00:44:13,835
Speaker 2:  ones that I'm missing. But the first one is using it essentially as a

716
00:44:13,835 --> 00:44:17,715
Speaker 2:  monitor for your computer as a a thing to attach to a Mac

717
00:44:17,935 --> 00:44:19,675
Speaker 2:  and do stuff with. Is it good?

718
00:44:19,905 --> 00:44:23,675
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that's really good. Caveats it. One, it's really good. You put, especially

719
00:44:23,675 --> 00:44:27,515
Speaker 5:  if you have a a laptop, you push the button. The thing that I really enjoyed

720
00:44:27,515 --> 00:44:31,285
Speaker 5:  doing was putting the, the virtual display over where my Mac display

721
00:44:31,305 --> 00:44:34,605
Speaker 5:  had been. My MacBook display had been and then making it really big. So then

722
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:38,565
Speaker 5:  you're like, I have a 50 inch MacBook Pro, I'm gonna use Lightroom. It's

723
00:44:38,565 --> 00:44:39,605
Speaker 5:  cool. Like that is just cool.

724
00:44:39,705 --> 00:44:42,845
Speaker 2:  So it's like you have your Mac on your desk and then a giant ass like TV

725
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:45,285
Speaker 2:  sized monitor in front of you. Right?

726
00:44:45,285 --> 00:44:47,805
Speaker 5:  But like where the MacBook display is, oh

727
00:44:49,225 --> 00:44:53,165
Speaker 2:  Can you do the thing from your Mac where you have like a

728
00:44:53,165 --> 00:44:56,805
Speaker 2:  bunch of windows spread around the room or whatever. Can I put Mac apps in

729
00:44:56,805 --> 00:44:58,605
Speaker 2:  all those places? Or is that just Vision Pro apps

730
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:02,805
Speaker 5:  You get one single Mac display, you can't have multiple Mac displays, which

731
00:45:02,805 --> 00:45:06,685
Speaker 5:  know a lot of people wanna do, which you can do to much less good effect

732
00:45:06,715 --> 00:45:09,845
Speaker 5:  with Quest headsets, right? Like there are apps in the Quest that just will

733
00:45:09,845 --> 00:45:13,045
Speaker 5:  let you have multiple monitors. Yeah, I assume there will be those apps for

734
00:45:13,045 --> 00:45:17,005
Speaker 5:  Vision Pro, but by default and with all of the cool iCloud stuff that

735
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:20,485
Speaker 5:  you want, which is really important. It's one display. And by the way, the

736
00:45:20,485 --> 00:45:23,365
Speaker 5:  cool iCloud stuff, magic, you know, this is like an iPad on your face. Like

737
00:45:23,365 --> 00:45:26,805
Speaker 5:  it's a very easy way to understand what's happening here and the cool iPad

738
00:45:26,805 --> 00:45:30,725
Speaker 5:  stuff that Continuity can do is amazing in this context. So you're

739
00:45:30,725 --> 00:45:34,325
Speaker 5:  using a Mac in this window and then you just scroll the mouse on the Mac

740
00:45:34,325 --> 00:45:38,285
Speaker 5:  Track pad over and it turns into a Vision Pro Cursor. You copy from the Mac

741
00:45:38,285 --> 00:45:41,165
Speaker 5:  in this window and you paste it in the Vision Pro app over here and it just

742
00:45:41,165 --> 00:45:42,285
Speaker 5:  works. That's cool. Very cool.

743
00:45:42,705 --> 00:45:46,285
Speaker 2:  All right, so that's that one. And then the other one is basically using

744
00:45:46,345 --> 00:45:50,125
Speaker 2:  it as a TV entertainment system. This is the one I think Alex and I are both

745
00:45:50,145 --> 00:45:53,405
Speaker 2:  the most theoretically excited about. That feels like it could be the most

746
00:45:53,405 --> 00:45:55,765
Speaker 2:  immediately useful for people. Is it a good tv?

747
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:59,765
Speaker 5:  Super good. Okay, very good. I watched way more of Top Gun Maverick than

748
00:45:59,765 --> 00:46:03,725
Speaker 5:  I wanted to. And by the way, I watched it on the treadmill at 2.7

749
00:46:03,725 --> 00:46:06,485
Speaker 5:  miles an hour, just walking up a hill very slowly. Okay. I did not try to

750
00:46:06,485 --> 00:46:10,365
Speaker 5:  run, I was like, I'm not, yeah, I don Dunno about this, but I was like, can

751
00:46:10,365 --> 00:46:14,325
Speaker 5:  I take a slow walk watching a movie on the best TV I can get in near a

752
00:46:14,405 --> 00:46:18,245
Speaker 5:  treadmill? And the answer was unequivocally yes. Very cool. It does

753
00:46:18,245 --> 00:46:21,845
Speaker 5:  this really cool thing when you put it in environments where the light from

754
00:46:21,965 --> 00:46:25,925
Speaker 5:  the TV reflects, unlike the mountain, it's, it's just all very cool. The

755
00:46:25,925 --> 00:46:29,725
Speaker 5:  caveat I will give you is it supports 3D,

756
00:46:29,865 --> 00:46:32,405
Speaker 5:  it supports high frame rate. It's the only consumer device that supports

757
00:46:32,405 --> 00:46:36,325
Speaker 5:  high frame rate 3D. So you can watch Avatar wave water at 48 frames

758
00:46:36,325 --> 00:46:39,525
Speaker 5:  per second and three DI don't know if that's good. It's just like, that's

759
00:46:39,525 --> 00:46:42,885
Speaker 5:  what James Cameron wants. Like you can, you can, you can live that life.

760
00:46:43,205 --> 00:46:46,965
Speaker 5:  I watched five minutes that and I was sick. Oh wow. And I, you know, like

761
00:46:46,985 --> 00:46:50,725
Speaker 5:  I'm pretty good at vr like I do, I I play grand. My vr right. VR motion

762
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:54,565
Speaker 5:  does not drive me too crazy. This was like too much and I had to take it

763
00:46:54,565 --> 00:46:58,445
Speaker 5:  off immediately. So I would just be careful and there are no guardrails anywhere

764
00:46:58,465 --> 00:47:01,645
Speaker 5:  in Vision Os to tell you, be careful. The, the one that I've seen

765
00:47:02,425 --> 00:47:06,245
Speaker 5:  is if you take a spatial, like a a first person video and

766
00:47:06,245 --> 00:47:09,685
Speaker 5:  there's a lot of motion in it, it will detect that there's a lot of motion

767
00:47:09,685 --> 00:47:12,285
Speaker 5:  in it and be like, be careful watching this one. It does not say be careful

768
00:47:12,525 --> 00:47:13,125
Speaker 5:  watching Avatar wave

769
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:13,805
Speaker 2:  Water. Interesting.

770
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:16,885
Speaker 5:  But if be your own video, it'll sometimes say be careful.

771
00:47:17,105 --> 00:47:20,565
Speaker 2:  You should always be careful watching the way of water, no matter the circumstances.

772
00:47:20,985 --> 00:47:22,285
Speaker 2:  You should always be careful. Yeah.

773
00:47:22,925 --> 00:47:25,725
Speaker 5:  But yeah, the TV stuff is good. The thing that I will two caveats there.

774
00:47:26,065 --> 00:47:29,565
Speaker 5:  One, you're alone, there's no you even if like three of you have a vision

775
00:47:29,585 --> 00:47:32,485
Speaker 5:  pro together, you can't sync 'em up. So you can't look at the same thing

776
00:47:32,485 --> 00:47:36,445
Speaker 5:  at the same time. I mean you can manually sync them up, which is sad if

777
00:47:36,445 --> 00:47:38,845
Speaker 5:  you find yourself with like three people wearing a vision pro counting to

778
00:47:38,845 --> 00:47:42,005
Speaker 5:  three to hit the play button on Avatar. Like just buy a tv.

779
00:47:42,115 --> 00:47:45,325
Speaker 2:  It's like the thing on a plane where you, you try and hit play on on both

780
00:47:45,635 --> 00:47:48,405
Speaker 2:  screens at the same time. It's good stuff. Yeah.

781
00:47:48,505 --> 00:47:52,485
Speaker 5:  So like there, but there's no in in os sinking of that stuff.

782
00:47:52,485 --> 00:47:56,165
Speaker 5:  So you Yeah. I'll watch the same thing, which is weird Right. Movie or someone

783
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:59,845
Speaker 5:  social experiences and then two, you can't screen record what you're seeing

784
00:48:00,075 --> 00:48:03,525
Speaker 5:  like Disney will just DRM that shit out. Yeah. And I was like, this sucks.

785
00:48:03,555 --> 00:48:07,445
Speaker 5:  Like that's me being like, oh this sucks. Like a huge part

786
00:48:07,445 --> 00:48:09,845
Speaker 5:  of the experience of watching shows right now is like sharing clips of social

787
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:13,565
Speaker 5:  media or whatever and you can't Weird it's, and then, and then it's your

788
00:48:13,565 --> 00:48:16,365
Speaker 5:  eyes, right? You're like, I'm seeing this. Look at how cool the light on

789
00:48:16,365 --> 00:48:19,965
Speaker 5:  the mountains is. I can't show it to you because of copyright restrictions.

790
00:48:20,695 --> 00:48:21,525
Speaker 5:  Weird. Yeah.

791
00:48:21,785 --> 00:48:23,765
Speaker 6:  I'm sorry for laughing. That is weird.

792
00:48:24,195 --> 00:48:28,165
Speaker 5:  It's weird. It's weird to be like, oh, like Bob Iger has DRM

793
00:48:28,165 --> 00:48:30,525
Speaker 5:  to my eyes, I don't like that

794
00:48:30,755 --> 00:48:33,805
Speaker 6:  Very black mirror feeling. Yeah. Like I just keep thinking that the episode

795
00:48:33,805 --> 00:48:37,525
Speaker 6:  where she like gets her her husband outta the way or boyfriend or whatever.

796
00:48:37,675 --> 00:48:40,365
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And it just feels like these, this headset's really equipped for that

797
00:48:41,425 --> 00:48:42,645
Speaker 6:  but not in a pleasant way.

798
00:48:42,875 --> 00:48:43,965
Speaker 5:  It's weird man. Yeah,

799
00:48:44,115 --> 00:48:44,405
Speaker 6:  It's

800
00:48:44,405 --> 00:48:48,205
Speaker 2:  Weird. Are there any like big picture use cases other than those two?

801
00:48:48,205 --> 00:48:51,925
Speaker 2:  Those are the two people seem to mostly ask us about and also being have

802
00:48:51,925 --> 00:48:54,965
Speaker 2:  been kind of imagining since this thing first launched. Is there anything

803
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:58,445
Speaker 2:  that like leaps out to you as equally big to those two things?

804
00:48:58,905 --> 00:49:01,805
Speaker 5:  No. To be perfectly blunt, I mean I think the Mac thing is,

805
00:49:03,005 --> 00:49:06,765
Speaker 5:  I want to see how people actually react to it. Yeah. Like it's cool and it

806
00:49:06,765 --> 00:49:10,525
Speaker 5:  was really cool, but 25 60 by 1440 is not enough. Yep. Like my

807
00:49:10,525 --> 00:49:13,405
Speaker 5:  16 inch practical pro is more a solution than that. Right. So it's cool to

808
00:49:13,405 --> 00:49:16,765
Speaker 5:  have a big like editing and Lightroom huge is great, but then the sort of

809
00:49:16,765 --> 00:49:19,565
Speaker 5:  reality of the resolution is actually you're gonna find yourself fighting

810
00:49:19,565 --> 00:49:22,845
Speaker 5:  it. And then you know, TV is tv. Like some of that stuff is really cool.

811
00:49:23,665 --> 00:49:25,925
Speaker 5:  But I was, again, I was watching the playoffs last night. There's no Fox

812
00:49:25,925 --> 00:49:29,485
Speaker 5:  Sports app to scream in 4K and I was watching YouTube TV

813
00:49:30,055 --> 00:49:33,645
Speaker 5:  seven 20 P Fox at huge stuff. It's like you

814
00:49:34,085 --> 00:49:35,365
Speaker 5:  yeah, you

815
00:49:37,235 --> 00:49:37,525
Speaker 2:  Fair.

816
00:49:37,675 --> 00:49:41,205
Speaker 5:  There's a part of me and I'm just a shameless plug for the TV that I'm

817
00:49:41,205 --> 00:49:45,165
Speaker 5:  convincing myself was not an extraordinarily splurged purchase. You

818
00:49:45,165 --> 00:49:49,125
Speaker 5:  can go buy an is o lead for far less money and then you'll have a

819
00:49:49,125 --> 00:49:52,325
Speaker 5:  really nice TV that you can take pictures of if you wanna share something.

820
00:49:53,225 --> 00:49:55,365
Speaker 2:  But then Bob Iger will come to your house and

821
00:49:55,495 --> 00:49:59,445
Speaker 5:  Throw, then Bob, he is like, look, I'm not busy enough. I need you to stop

822
00:49:59,445 --> 00:49:59,765
Speaker 5:  doing that.

823
00:50:00,115 --> 00:50:01,005
Speaker 6:  Just cuts the cord

824
00:50:01,025 --> 00:50:03,805
Speaker 2:  Off. Alright, one more before we take a break and then we're gonna do some

825
00:50:04,045 --> 00:50:07,005
Speaker 2:  listener questions. Then we're gonna get outta here. The Vision Pro. Is it

826
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:07,205
Speaker 2:  good?

827
00:50:07,665 --> 00:50:11,325
Speaker 5:  The Vision Pro is the best version of this thing that anyone has ever made.

828
00:50:11,355 --> 00:50:11,645
Speaker 5:  Okay.

829
00:50:11,935 --> 00:50:15,925
Speaker 2:  Which to to Apple's credit has basically been what it has been

830
00:50:15,925 --> 00:50:18,725
Speaker 2:  saying about this all along. Right? Like the answer to why is this thing

831
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:22,485
Speaker 2:  $3,500 is because it is the best one of these we can make.

832
00:50:22,905 --> 00:50:26,845
Speaker 5:  Yes. Without question, it is the best version of this headset that anyone

833
00:50:26,865 --> 00:50:30,725
Speaker 5:  has ever made. It is unquestionably still a VR headset. It is a

834
00:50:30,725 --> 00:50:34,645
Speaker 5:  primary computing device. I do not think VR headsets are it. Maybe

835
00:50:34,675 --> 00:50:38,605
Speaker 5:  this thing just proves that point to a lot of people. Right. It is weird

836
00:50:38,665 --> 00:50:42,205
Speaker 5:  to be alone using a computer the way that this thing makes you alone. Hmm.

837
00:50:42,785 --> 00:50:45,525
Speaker 5:  We haven't even talked about the front display. Right. The, you know, the

838
00:50:45,525 --> 00:50:48,445
Speaker 5:  big thing about this that is supposed to make you not feel alone is the front

839
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:51,845
Speaker 5:  display showing your eyes to other people. Right? Well, you can't see 'em

840
00:50:51,845 --> 00:50:54,885
Speaker 5:  most of the time they're sup. It's super dim and that glass is really reflective

841
00:50:55,425 --> 00:50:58,765
Speaker 5:  and mostly people are like, am I supposed to be seeing something? And you're

842
00:50:58,765 --> 00:50:59,765
Speaker 5:  like, it's my eyes. And they're like, ah.

843
00:51:01,165 --> 00:51:04,565
Speaker 6:  I was like, is that actually maybe a good thing that you can't see it? Most

844
00:51:04,565 --> 00:51:04,925
Speaker 6:  of the time

845
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:08,165
Speaker 5:  They don't look good. They look like they totally look like CGI. It's a super

846
00:51:08,225 --> 00:51:11,965
Speaker 5:  low re display in there. Like I, I've seen the part, you know, in a briefing

847
00:51:12,155 --> 00:51:15,405
Speaker 5:  it's, you can just like, it's just a grid of pixels, like a sports stadium

848
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:19,045
Speaker 5:  screen or something. Or the sphere. God bless the sphere.

849
00:51:19,345 --> 00:51:22,045
Speaker 5:  Here's a question. Would you rather live in the vision pro or live in the

850
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:23,325
Speaker 5:  sphere? And the answer is the sphere.

851
00:51:24,875 --> 00:51:27,685
Speaker 2:  Okay. Sphere's a little more expensive but you know, it's okay,

852
00:51:28,125 --> 00:51:31,645
Speaker 5:  But it's really dim. You can't really see the eyes. You're never making anything

853
00:51:31,645 --> 00:51:34,685
Speaker 5:  that actually looks like eye contact. Like it just, that's not happening.

854
00:51:35,105 --> 00:51:37,685
Speaker 5:  So it's like you're just alone in there and like the stuff that I think is

855
00:51:37,685 --> 00:51:40,365
Speaker 5:  really cool, like yesterday I was walking around the, the cafe of our office,

856
00:51:40,365 --> 00:51:44,165
Speaker 5:  which is huge and I just had windows all over the place in there, just

857
00:51:44,165 --> 00:51:47,125
Speaker 5:  windows for days just like over tables floating in space. And I was just

858
00:51:47,125 --> 00:51:50,365
Speaker 5:  walking around looking at stuff and I was like, this rules.

859
00:51:51,305 --> 00:51:54,525
Speaker 5:  And no one else could experience that with me. Like other people just saw

860
00:51:54,525 --> 00:51:55,645
Speaker 5:  me looking around, pointing it up.

861
00:51:57,245 --> 00:52:00,565
Speaker 5:  I just think there's something lonely about that. Like really

862
00:52:01,155 --> 00:52:04,805
Speaker 5:  intensely lonely and I would rather not have that

863
00:52:04,805 --> 00:52:08,725
Speaker 5:  experience. And So I think VR is great. I like, I'm a VR headset user. I

864
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:12,645
Speaker 5:  love playing Grand. My own vr, I love Supernatural. Like there's single use

865
00:52:12,685 --> 00:52:16,645
Speaker 5:  applications, mostly gaming that make a lot of sense to like

866
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:20,645
Speaker 5:  have a focused lonely experience for using an iPad. don

867
00:52:20,645 --> 00:52:23,445
Speaker 5:  don't know, I like half the time I'm like, look at this on my screen to someone

868
00:52:23,445 --> 00:52:27,245
Speaker 5:  else. And that is really hard to do. Yeah. So I. It is the best version of

869
00:52:27,245 --> 00:52:30,845
Speaker 5:  this that has ever been made. But I went through and looked at every Tim

870
00:52:30,875 --> 00:52:34,685
Speaker 5:  Cook quote about VR and AR for the past decade and his complaint

871
00:52:34,685 --> 00:52:38,565
Speaker 5:  about it always has been VR is isolating and like I'm here at

872
00:52:38,565 --> 00:52:40,965
Speaker 5:  the end with holding the thing and I'm like, yep, VR is pretty isolating.

873
00:52:41,115 --> 00:52:44,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I mean that the, the like, big question I think we're gonna

874
00:52:44,925 --> 00:52:48,725
Speaker 2:  spend a lot of time talking about and covering over the next few years really

875
00:52:48,945 --> 00:52:52,765
Speaker 2:  is, is the vision pro like the end of that arc

876
00:52:53,385 --> 00:52:57,205
Speaker 2:  in which we realize that's not where we're headed? Or is it sort of overlapping

877
00:52:57,225 --> 00:52:59,565
Speaker 2:  the end of that arc, but it is actually the beginning of the next thing.

878
00:52:59,565 --> 00:53:01,925
Speaker 2:  And I think Apple wants you to believe it's the beginning of the next thing,

879
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:06,125
Speaker 2:  but what it built looks more like the end of the VR arc and So

880
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:08,485
Speaker 2:  I think, which it turns out to be is gonna be really interesting over time.

881
00:53:08,745 --> 00:53:12,605
Speaker 5:  We can end here. There's a real danger reviewing a first generation Apple

882
00:53:12,605 --> 00:53:12,845
Speaker 5:  product.

883
00:53:12,985 --> 00:53:13,405
Speaker 2:  Yes. Yep.

884
00:53:13,725 --> 00:53:17,565
Speaker 5:  I I feel it. Right? Like nobody looks back on a first generation like

885
00:53:17,685 --> 00:53:20,005
Speaker 5:  Quest review and is like they got it wrong. Like a first generation Apple

886
00:53:20,005 --> 00:53:23,445
Speaker 5:  product. Especially when you're in a tiny group of reviewers. People look

887
00:53:23,445 --> 00:53:26,845
Speaker 5:  back on it and they're like, you got it wrong. And I know this is a risk

888
00:53:26,845 --> 00:53:29,965
Speaker 5:  to say, but I'm gonna say this, this feels like it will convince a lot of

889
00:53:29,965 --> 00:53:33,725
Speaker 5:  people that some of these technologies are dead ends. Mm. Right. Like you,

890
00:53:33,785 --> 00:53:36,925
Speaker 5:  if you, you can try as hard as you want. You can be one of the richest companies

891
00:53:36,925 --> 00:53:39,965
Speaker 5:  in the world. You can put all of that capability in and there's a lot of

892
00:53:39,965 --> 00:53:42,645
Speaker 5:  this thing that feels like Apple made it because only Apple can make it.

893
00:53:42,895 --> 00:53:46,565
Speaker 5:  Right. Like the Giant's just looking for a fight and found one

894
00:53:47,335 --> 00:53:51,165
Speaker 5:  great. I think that's so cool. Like I, I have no qualms with that. Go

895
00:53:51,165 --> 00:53:54,885
Speaker 5:  get it. But that means if you look at this device, you're like, oh, pass

896
00:53:54,885 --> 00:53:58,765
Speaker 5:  through VR does not actually substitute for the goal, which is optical

897
00:53:58,765 --> 00:54:01,525
Speaker 5:  ar where you're just looking through a pair of glasses and the computer's

898
00:54:01,525 --> 00:54:05,125
Speaker 5:  putting stuff over reality. Like that's the goal. You gotta get there. And

899
00:54:05,125 --> 00:54:08,885
Speaker 5:  this thing, there's no, there's no path from here to there. And I don don't

900
00:54:08,885 --> 00:54:12,525
Speaker 5:  know, like that's my big take from this thing is like, it feels like Apple

901
00:54:12,525 --> 00:54:15,605
Speaker 5:  needed to build a simulator of the computing experiences it wanted to build.

902
00:54:16,145 --> 00:54:19,685
Speaker 5:  And if it talked about it that way, I might be a little, a little more charitable,

903
00:54:19,685 --> 00:54:22,045
Speaker 5:  but they're like show their ad is like people are just like doing laundry

904
00:54:22,065 --> 00:54:24,525
Speaker 5:  in it. It's like, no that this, this is not that thing.

905
00:54:24,955 --> 00:54:28,125
Speaker 2:  Okay. Alright. Well by the time you're hearing this, Eli's review is live.

906
00:54:28,125 --> 00:54:31,605
Speaker 2:  The video's live. Go watch it. Go read it. We're gonna take a break and then

907
00:54:31,605 --> 00:54:33,845
Speaker 2:  we're gonna come back and we're gonna do five minutes of quick questions.

908
00:54:33,845 --> 00:54:35,125
Speaker 2:  Then we're gonna get outta here. Be

909
00:57:49,125 --> 00:57:52,225
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. So. I have a big list of questions thanks to everybody

910
00:57:52,225 --> 00:57:55,625
Speaker 2:  who called and emailed and posted with questions. We've answered a bunch

911
00:57:55,625 --> 00:57:58,625
Speaker 2:  of them already, which is great. So we're just gonna blow through a bunch

912
00:57:58,625 --> 00:58:02,105
Speaker 2:  of the ones we didn't do already. The first one is a hotline question from

913
00:58:02,105 --> 00:58:02,305
Speaker 2:  Joe.

914
00:58:03,565 --> 00:58:06,745
Speaker 13:  Hi, my name's Joe and about the Apple Vision Pro.

915
00:58:07,495 --> 00:58:10,785
Speaker 13:  What does the thing smell like while you're wearing it?

916
00:58:11,375 --> 00:58:14,745
Speaker 2:  Nila, we got this question so many times I cannot tell you. How does it smell?

917
00:58:15,025 --> 00:58:15,625
Speaker 2:  I need to know.

918
00:58:16,265 --> 00:58:19,465
Speaker 5:  I don't know why people ask me this question. Here's my solution. AirPods

919
00:58:19,465 --> 00:58:23,385
Speaker 5:  Max outta the box had a smell because they were like manufactured in

920
00:58:23,385 --> 00:58:26,345
Speaker 5:  China and then shipped over here and like they, whatever particular process

921
00:58:26,445 --> 00:58:29,265
Speaker 5:  on the fabric I think has a smell. So there's like a tiny whiff of that smell

922
00:58:29,265 --> 00:58:32,865
Speaker 5:  immediately went away. Will they smell after you sweat in them for a while,

923
00:58:33,465 --> 00:58:37,345
Speaker 5:  don? Don't dunno yet. Okay. Dunno. Yet. I do know I had a little Z

924
00:58:37,345 --> 00:58:40,505
Speaker 5:  in my face with a video review and I wore a little bit of concealer and it

925
00:58:40,505 --> 00:58:43,385
Speaker 5:  got on the headband and I asked Joanne about this and she's like, that's

926
00:58:43,385 --> 00:58:45,745
Speaker 5:  covered in my review too. Interesting. But here's a big question. Do you

927
00:58:45,745 --> 00:58:48,385
Speaker 5:  wanna wear a computer that messes up your hair every time? Use it wrong.

928
00:58:48,645 --> 00:58:51,265
Speaker 5:  No. Do you wanna wear a computer that messes up your makeup every time you

929
00:58:51,265 --> 00:58:55,025
Speaker 5:  use it? Is it a different bigger question? Ooh and that

930
00:58:55,025 --> 00:58:58,905
Speaker 5:  stuff might smell, you know? Yes. Like once you cake this thing full

931
00:58:58,905 --> 00:59:00,305
Speaker 5:  of sweat and makeup Ooh.

932
00:59:00,615 --> 00:59:03,865
Speaker 2:  Okay. All right. That's a good one. Next, a question from Matt and we talked

933
00:59:03,865 --> 00:59:06,825
Speaker 2:  about this a little bit but I I, and it seems like the answer so far is we'll

934
00:59:06,825 --> 00:59:10,545
Speaker 2:  see, but he asks, is there any gaming use case beyond playing on a virtual

935
00:59:10,665 --> 00:59:14,305
Speaker 2:  screen with an Xcl controller that it seems like you can just do now, right?

936
00:59:14,305 --> 00:59:18,185
Speaker 2:  Like you can play games kind of from a Mac or in theory from Game Pass

937
00:59:18,185 --> 00:59:20,625
Speaker 2:  through Safari or whatever, but have you, is there any other gaming stuff

938
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:22,525
Speaker 2:  you've seen seen that sparks something in you?

939
00:59:23,465 --> 00:59:27,165
Speaker 5:  No, I mean the, the games are all like iPad games in three DI played we to

940
00:59:27,165 --> 00:59:30,405
Speaker 5:  golf, which is really fun. Nice. But it's still like it's in 3D, right? Those

941
00:59:30,405 --> 00:59:33,605
Speaker 5:  are, it's a 3D game inherently you're just looking at on 2D thing. And so

942
00:59:33,605 --> 00:59:36,045
Speaker 5:  like they just built it so it's virtual and you like pull back and let go.

943
00:59:36,645 --> 00:59:40,485
Speaker 5:  There's nothing like NFL Pro era or like any of these big VR

944
00:59:40,495 --> 00:59:44,085
Speaker 5:  games. They are to come. I'm told they are to come, but nothing yet.

945
00:59:44,565 --> 00:59:47,685
Speaker 2:  And that's actually a good segue to another question that we got from Kyle

946
00:59:48,185 --> 00:59:51,405
Speaker 2:  who says, I wanna know what iPad ports are like and if there's any jankis

947
00:59:51,405 --> 00:59:54,885
Speaker 2:  with them both in how they work and the general UI basically like apps that

948
00:59:54,885 --> 00:59:58,325
Speaker 2:  are just iPad apps that they check the checkbox to say put it on the Vision

949
00:59:58,345 --> 00:59:59,765
Speaker 2:  Pro. What have you seen so far?

950
01:00:00,485 --> 01:00:03,405
Speaker 5:  I think it is very telling that Apple shipped a bunch of its own apps as

951
01:00:03,405 --> 01:00:07,285
Speaker 5:  iPad apps. Fascinating. iPad apps are designed for your fingers. And so

952
01:00:07,285 --> 01:00:11,245
Speaker 5:  the eye tracking is even more frustrating than iPad apps. Mm. 'cause all

953
01:00:11,245 --> 01:00:14,565
Speaker 5:  the targets are even smaller. They work, they there's no, there's no not

954
01:00:14,565 --> 01:00:18,525
Speaker 5:  working. Right. They they work but you will inha you will realize like, oh,

955
01:00:18,985 --> 01:00:22,045
Speaker 5:  the same way that putting a mouse and keyboard experience on a touch screen

956
01:00:22,045 --> 01:00:22,765
Speaker 5:  can be frustrating.

957
01:00:23,005 --> 01:00:26,205
Speaker 2:  I was just gonna say like, have you ever attached a mouse or one of the keyboard

958
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:30,085
Speaker 2:  attachments on the iPad with the track pad? It's like it feels cool and also

959
01:00:30,475 --> 01:00:32,045
Speaker 2:  like it was clearly not designed for that.

960
01:00:33,115 --> 01:00:36,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And you can, you know, if you have a, they sent me a magic keyboard,

961
01:00:36,365 --> 01:00:39,405
Speaker 5:  a magic track pad. I had those connected a lot. You can just like, that all

962
01:00:39,405 --> 01:00:42,245
Speaker 5:  looks like iPad os it's all the same stuff. So yeah, they're totally usable.

963
01:00:42,245 --> 01:00:46,165
Speaker 5:  There's no particular weirdness there except if you're using hand and

964
01:00:46,165 --> 01:00:50,045
Speaker 5:  eye tracking you'll quickly discover that that apps are designed for

965
01:00:50,045 --> 01:00:53,485
Speaker 5:  not that And sometimes that shows up. I think it's totally, it's like barely

966
01:00:53,485 --> 01:00:55,325
Speaker 5:  criticism. Like it's just obvious what's happening.

967
01:00:55,715 --> 01:00:59,405
Speaker 6:  It's better than like when all the iPhone apps came to iPad and it was very

968
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:01,605
Speaker 6:  clearly like just the iPhone app big.

969
01:01:01,665 --> 01:01:03,325
Speaker 2:  Oh yeah, that's a good comparison. It's

970
01:01:03,325 --> 01:01:04,325
Speaker 5:  Way, way, way better than that. Yeah.

971
01:01:04,325 --> 01:01:07,885
Speaker 2:  Okay. Okay good. Alright, I have another hotline question. Another one. Believe

972
01:01:07,885 --> 01:01:10,165
Speaker 2:  it or not that we got multiple times from Ray.

973
01:01:11,265 --> 01:01:15,165
Speaker 14:  Hey this is Ray and this is a question about the Vision Pro. I wonder

974
01:01:15,165 --> 01:01:18,845
Speaker 14:  what happens if you look in a mirror with the Vision Pro

975
01:01:18,985 --> 01:01:22,525
Speaker 14:  on, would it phase you in like it does with other people or would it

976
01:01:22,765 --> 01:01:26,485
Speaker 14:  recognize that you're wearing the Vision Pro and not do it? And what happens

977
01:01:26,485 --> 01:01:30,165
Speaker 14:  if you turn on the fake eyes but it consider you a person that can fade

978
01:01:30,285 --> 01:01:31,325
Speaker 14:  into thanks.

979
01:01:31,835 --> 01:01:34,325
Speaker 5:  This is one of the first things I tried. Why do you think I was in the bathroom?

980
01:01:36,305 --> 01:01:39,725
Speaker 5:  You look crazy. You you? Because I was like trying to see my own eyes, right?

981
01:01:40,165 --> 01:01:42,725
Speaker 5:  So yeah, it does show you your own eyes, but I can't tell if it is because

982
01:01:42,725 --> 01:01:45,045
Speaker 5:  it thinks you're another person or if it knows that you're looking at yourself,

983
01:01:45,045 --> 01:01:48,285
Speaker 5:  which is like a weird Mm. Does a computer know I'm looking at myself is like,

984
01:01:48,505 --> 01:01:50,005
Speaker 5:  that's another two hours. Yeah, we

985
01:01:50,005 --> 01:01:50,645
Speaker 2:  Don't have time for that today.

986
01:01:52,185 --> 01:01:55,445
Speaker 2:  but it it like nothing horrible happened. Like, you're still here. No, you

987
01:01:55,445 --> 01:01:56,525
Speaker 2:  looked in the mirror, you're

988
01:01:56,525 --> 01:01:59,405
Speaker 5:  Still here. I was like, man, these eyes kind of suck. Walked away.

989
01:02:01,315 --> 01:02:05,285
Speaker 2:  Okay, cool. We got a question from Andy. Basically asking about

990
01:02:05,685 --> 01:02:09,005
Speaker 2:  multiple user support questions about OS and software

991
01:02:09,195 --> 01:02:12,725
Speaker 2:  adjustments for the hardware. Like is, is this a device you can

992
01:02:12,965 --> 01:02:14,125
Speaker 2:  functionally share with other people?

993
01:02:14,825 --> 01:02:18,565
Speaker 5:  No, absolutely not. The only affordance is something called guest

994
01:02:18,565 --> 01:02:22,445
Speaker 5:  mode where you say put this in guest mode and

995
01:02:22,445 --> 01:02:26,365
Speaker 5:  then it lets you limit what apps, whoever wears a headset can put can use

996
01:02:26,365 --> 01:02:28,925
Speaker 5:  next. And then it lets you limit whatever apps whoever's running a headset

997
01:02:28,985 --> 01:02:32,165
Speaker 5:  can use. And that's it. That's what you get. And then, and then you're supposed

998
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:34,565
Speaker 5:  to give it to someone else. They do a tiny little bit of setup just to align

999
01:02:34,565 --> 01:02:37,805
Speaker 5:  the displays. They don't even do the hand tracking setup and that's it. And

1000
01:02:37,805 --> 01:02:40,045
Speaker 5:  then so they then it's like you can only use Safari and they give it back

1001
01:02:40,045 --> 01:02:42,085
Speaker 5:  to you and you log in and you're good to go. But there's no multiple user

1002
01:02:42,085 --> 01:02:45,725
Speaker 5:  accounts. Nothing. It's, it is this thing is an iPad. Okay. But the same

1003
01:02:45,725 --> 01:02:48,605
Speaker 5:  way that iPad doesn't have multiple user support, this doesn't have it.

1004
01:02:48,785 --> 01:02:51,445
Speaker 6:  Did that feel like it heightened that lonely experience for you?

1005
01:02:51,715 --> 01:02:54,805
Speaker 5:  Yeah, this is my computer. Like you give it to someone else here you can

1006
01:02:54,805 --> 01:02:56,525
Speaker 5:  just use my computer now. It's weird. Yeah.

1007
01:02:56,635 --> 01:02:56,925
Speaker 2:  Okay.

1008
01:02:57,225 --> 01:03:00,245
Speaker 5:  By the way, a particularly weird thing about that is, you know, there's optic

1009
01:03:00,385 --> 01:03:03,685
Speaker 5:  id so someone else should not be able to unlock your computer. But 'cause

1010
01:03:03,685 --> 01:03:06,405
Speaker 5:  again, because other people are using it for capture and all this stuff to

1011
01:03:06,405 --> 01:03:09,285
Speaker 5:  make our video, other people can just be my persona.

1012
01:03:10,835 --> 01:03:14,325
Speaker 5:  Like they can make FaceTime calls with my head. It's like, it's not at all

1013
01:03:14,325 --> 01:03:16,965
Speaker 5:  how it's designed, it's just the reality of how we are using it today, which

1014
01:03:16,965 --> 01:03:17,125
Speaker 5:  is

1015
01:03:17,235 --> 01:03:20,085
Speaker 2:  Wild. Yeah. Talk about the personas for a sec. 'cause that was something

1016
01:03:20,085 --> 01:03:23,325
Speaker 2:  we got a couple of questions about too. This idea that if I make a FaceTime

1017
01:03:23,325 --> 01:03:26,925
Speaker 2:  call or I go on Google meet or whatever wearing this, that it's not

1018
01:03:26,925 --> 01:03:30,165
Speaker 2:  showing a camera version of me, it's showing like my

1019
01:03:31,305 --> 01:03:33,725
Speaker 2:  avatar. Yeah. What's the verdict on personas?

1020
01:03:34,565 --> 01:03:37,605
Speaker 5:  I will say what Marque said when we did our FaceTime call for the video.

1021
01:03:37,915 --> 01:03:41,645
Speaker 5:  This is very impressive And also bad. They're bad. They're in

1022
01:03:41,795 --> 01:03:45,285
Speaker 5:  like if I showed up in a meeting with a persona, I, I personally feel like

1023
01:03:45,285 --> 01:03:48,565
Speaker 5:  that would be insulting. So the persona just replaces the front facing camera.

1024
01:03:48,815 --> 01:03:51,605
Speaker 5:  Right? That's how you should think about it. Apps don't know it's happening.

1025
01:03:51,605 --> 01:03:55,365
Speaker 5:  They don't see it. They call for the front camera and they get

1026
01:03:55,675 --> 01:03:56,365
Speaker 5:  your persona.

1027
01:03:56,385 --> 01:03:59,925
Speaker 2:  Oh, so the Vision Pro just reports to whatever app you're doing? Yeah. This

1028
01:03:59,925 --> 01:04:00,925
Speaker 2:  is what the webcam is

1029
01:04:00,925 --> 01:04:03,925
Speaker 5:  Seeing. This is what the webcam is seeing. Oh. Which is fascinating. A great

1030
01:04:03,925 --> 01:04:06,725
Speaker 5:  hack. Like brilliant, right? Yeah. And then you know, you do the scan and

1031
01:04:06,725 --> 01:04:10,525
Speaker 5:  see your face, they look like PS three characters. Like we, I was talking

1032
01:04:10,525 --> 01:04:13,685
Speaker 5:  to Marquez and and Joanna on that call and I was like, Marquez, this looks

1033
01:04:13,685 --> 01:04:17,085
Speaker 5:  like you're about to give me an item that will help me fight the boss. Like

1034
01:04:17,385 --> 01:04:21,245
Speaker 5:  that's how it looks, you know, like Welcome To my store. Like in any

1035
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:25,085
Speaker 5:  game that you might play, they're ba they're uncanny. It's weird that they

1036
01:04:25,085 --> 01:04:27,605
Speaker 5:  have decided that everyone has the same tongue. Like You don't scan your

1037
01:04:27,605 --> 01:04:30,925
Speaker 5:  tongue, but you stick your tongue out. You have a tongue weird. Just weird.

1038
01:04:30,925 --> 01:04:33,805
Speaker 5:  Like someone at Apple is like do a tongue model. We'll just use it for everybody.

1039
01:04:35,505 --> 01:04:38,765
Speaker 5:  Do a tongue, like someone had that job, right?

1040
01:04:38,795 --> 01:04:40,765
Speaker 6:  Just the Gene Simmons tongue for everyone.

1041
01:04:40,795 --> 01:04:43,005
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's like you can't get different tongues. You, you're always wearing

1042
01:04:43,005 --> 01:04:46,005
Speaker 5:  the same clothes. It looks like you've just had the worst Botox ever.

1043
01:04:47,045 --> 01:04:50,925
Speaker 5:  Like I took a call with our creative director, will Joel to look at some

1044
01:04:50,925 --> 01:04:53,965
Speaker 5:  design stuff and he is like, I'm so used to looking at your face on these

1045
01:04:53,965 --> 01:04:57,485
Speaker 5:  calls because you're looking at something and you know, like your face

1046
01:04:57,485 --> 01:05:00,605
Speaker 5:  portrays more than you ever seen. And he is like, it's just, I can't, this

1047
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:04,525
Speaker 5:  is, I, this is not useful for me. So yeah, I Apple, it's in beta.

1048
01:05:04,525 --> 01:05:07,325
Speaker 5:  There's a reason it's in beta. There's a reason they haven't shown it to

1049
01:05:07,325 --> 01:05:11,125
Speaker 5:  anyone. Like it's not good. Yeah. Like there's a long way to go. Well

1050
01:05:11,305 --> 01:05:14,765
Speaker 5:  and it's like, you know for, I keep saying it has to be 50% better. I can

1051
01:05:14,765 --> 01:05:17,525
Speaker 5:  see how this can get 50% better. It's very offense.

1052
01:05:19,035 --> 01:05:22,725
Speaker 2:  Okay, fair enough. Alright, two more then. We'll then we're outta here from

1053
01:05:22,725 --> 01:05:26,565
Speaker 2:  Jesse. What is it like looking at real world displays through pass through

1054
01:05:26,865 --> 01:05:29,045
Speaker 2:  TVs, PCs, phones, smartwatches, et cetera?

1055
01:05:29,395 --> 01:05:32,565
Speaker 5:  Fine, but blurry. Okay. Yeah, that it fine, but blurry. Fair enough. Like

1056
01:05:32,565 --> 01:05:33,965
Speaker 5:  I, I can just use my phone, but it's blurry.

1057
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:38,205
Speaker 2:  And last one from our Raj who asks, is the digital crown

1058
01:05:38,205 --> 01:05:41,725
Speaker 2:  really useful to gradually transition between VR and ar? I don't see any

1059
01:05:41,725 --> 01:05:44,525
Speaker 2:  point where a person has to be in between the two modes. They could have

1060
01:05:44,525 --> 01:05:45,325
Speaker 2:  just switched back and forth.

1061
01:05:45,705 --> 01:05:48,645
Speaker 5:  So using it, you'll quickly discover there's a lot of times you wanna be

1062
01:05:48,645 --> 01:05:52,365
Speaker 5:  in between the two modes because if you put windows out in space and they're

1063
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:56,285
Speaker 5:  like going through walls or things, it screws their

1064
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:59,765
Speaker 5:  brain. So you're like, here's a portal into depth.

1065
01:05:59,995 --> 01:06:03,885
Speaker 5:  Like here's a portal into a big desert landscape. And so instead of

1066
01:06:03,885 --> 01:06:07,645
Speaker 5:  walls in front of me, there's like depth and now I can put windows into that

1067
01:06:07,655 --> 01:06:11,605
Speaker 5:  depth while I still have the room around me and I can look around. So

1068
01:06:11,605 --> 01:06:15,445
Speaker 5:  that is very useful. It is an inherent right? It is a big compromise

1069
01:06:15,475 --> 01:06:19,045
Speaker 5:  over like, should this be ar right? That's like I'm creating a virtual environment

1070
01:06:19,045 --> 01:06:22,165
Speaker 5:  to solve the problem of AR in this moment. And then you want to, you know,

1071
01:06:22,165 --> 01:06:26,125
Speaker 5:  you have Fuller on the moon, but like that halfway setting you, I

1072
01:06:26,125 --> 01:06:28,805
Speaker 5:  ended up using a lot more just to create that depth for the os.

1073
01:06:29,465 --> 01:06:33,325
Speaker 2:  All right, NELI, you have to go. You have now 26

1074
01:06:33,335 --> 01:06:36,005
Speaker 2:  hours to change your mind about everything. Chop

1075
01:06:36,005 --> 01:06:39,725
Speaker 5:  Chop. Send more questions. We'll, we'll do more of these. I, I know people

1076
01:06:39,725 --> 01:06:40,725
Speaker 5:  are gonna have infinite questions.

1077
01:06:40,865 --> 01:06:43,525
Speaker 2:  Oh for sure. And we, yeah, we're gonna, we're gonna cover this a bunch. We'll

1078
01:06:43,525 --> 01:06:45,965
Speaker 2:  talk about it more on Friday show. We'll, we'll we have a lot to do and I

1079
01:06:45,965 --> 01:06:49,165
Speaker 2:  think especially as we start to see more apps, we're gonna talk a lot about

1080
01:06:49,165 --> 01:06:49,845
Speaker 2:  this. So Yeah,

1081
01:06:50,125 --> 01:06:53,205
Speaker 5:  I think we have a lot developers have to basically make this product work.
