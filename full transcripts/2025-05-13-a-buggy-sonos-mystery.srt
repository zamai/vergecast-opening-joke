Description: The Verge's Will Poor recently came home from vacation and discovered he had an insect problem. More specifically, his Sonos speaker had an insect problem. Will brings us the story of what really happened there, and what he discovered about how the animal kingdom — and the electronics world — works. After that, The Verge's Andru Marino tells us about his research on all things AI podcasts. He tells us why people are so hooked on NotebookLM's Audio Overviews, where these generated shows fall short, and what all us human podcasters could learn from the bots. Finally, The Verge's Jennifer Pattison Tuohy helps us answer a question on the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!) all about smart lights. Which get complicated faster than you think.


2
00:00:03,335 --> 00:00:06,705
Speaker 2:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of a very

3
00:00:07,265 --> 00:00:11,065
Speaker 2:  specific kind of pest control. I'm your friend David Pierce, and I am sitting

4
00:00:11,065 --> 00:00:14,985
Speaker 2:  here doing a project I've been putting off for years, which

5
00:00:14,985 --> 00:00:18,585
Speaker 2:  is going through my surprisingly enormous collection of sports cards

6
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:22,265
Speaker 2:  to see if any of them are worth anything. They've just been sitting in a

7
00:00:22,265 --> 00:00:25,785
Speaker 2:  box. I really loved collecting them as a kid, and now I just have binders

8
00:00:25,785 --> 00:00:29,745
Speaker 2:  and binders full of them sitting around. I don't know if any of 'em are worth

9
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:33,585
Speaker 2:  anything, but I found this app, thank you, technology that lets you just

10
00:00:33,655 --> 00:00:37,625
Speaker 2:  scan the front of the card and it'll immediately identify it

11
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:41,025
Speaker 2:  and tell you if it's worth anything. The app's called Ldx

12
00:00:41,645 --> 00:00:44,745
Speaker 2:  and I have no idea if it's legit, but so far it's told me all of the cards

13
00:00:44,825 --> 00:00:48,665
Speaker 2:  I have are essentially worthless. We'll, see, I got a lot of them to go

14
00:00:48,665 --> 00:00:52,025
Speaker 2:  through. All you need is one, right? Anyway, that's not what we're here to

15
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:55,785
Speaker 2:  talk about. We are gonna do two things on the show today. First, I'm gonna

16
00:00:55,785 --> 00:00:59,545
Speaker 2:  talk to Will Poor about a very strange adventure he had after

17
00:00:59,545 --> 00:01:03,425
Speaker 2:  getting home from vacation and discovering what was going on inside of his

18
00:01:03,555 --> 00:01:07,265
Speaker 2:  Sonos. Then I'm gonna talk to Andrew Marino about an adventure

19
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:11,305
Speaker 2:  he's been on, trying to figure out whether all of these AI generated

20
00:01:11,345 --> 00:01:15,105
Speaker 2:  podcasts are actually up to something. Lots of fun stuff.

21
00:01:15,285 --> 00:01:18,345
Speaker 2:  We have a Hotline question about smart lates. Lots to do, lots to get to.

22
00:01:18,685 --> 00:01:22,505
Speaker 2:  All that is coming up in just a sec. But first I've decided I'm gonna scan

23
00:01:22,505 --> 00:01:25,825
Speaker 2:  these cards until I find one that is worth $20.

24
00:01:26,455 --> 00:01:29,745
Speaker 2:  That that doesn't seem like too much to ask. $20. We're going for it. This

25
00:01:29,745 --> 00:01:31,105
Speaker 2:  is The Vergecast. We'll be right back.

26
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:15,445
Speaker 7:  and I'm figuring out how to be a podcast producer again, so

27
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:19,445
Speaker 7:  we'll see if this is coherent in any way, but I think It is like

28
00:03:19,445 --> 00:03:20,005
Speaker 7:  riding a bike.

29
00:03:20,355 --> 00:03:23,205
Speaker 2:  Well, so one of the things we've been looking forward to in you coming back

30
00:03:23,265 --> 00:03:26,965
Speaker 2:  is you are a person with like lots of ideas and thoughts about stuff we should

31
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:30,645
Speaker 2:  do, and you and I, you and I overlap in some ways and also think really

32
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:32,645
Speaker 2:  differently in some ways. So it's like, it's very fun to get to work with

33
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:33,045
Speaker 2:  you on stuff.

34
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:38,805
Speaker 2:  You came back just like a house on fire being like, I have

35
00:03:38,805 --> 00:03:42,125
Speaker 2:  to talk about ants and Sonos. So

36
00:03:42,915 --> 00:03:46,285
Speaker 2:  with, I just, I don't even wanna wind this up for anybody. Like let's just,

37
00:03:46,705 --> 00:03:49,365
Speaker 2:  you, you literally came in and you're like, I have a story about ants and

38
00:03:49,415 --> 00:03:50,125
Speaker 2:  Sonos. Well, yeah.

39
00:03:50,165 --> 00:03:53,805
Speaker 7:  I came back and, and I was like, a thing happened to me.

40
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:57,765
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And I need to tell you about it. And the more I think about it,

41
00:03:57,925 --> 00:03:59,525
Speaker 7:  I think I need to tell the world about it. This

42
00:03:59,525 --> 00:04:00,125
Speaker 2:  Is what we're here for.

43
00:04:00,545 --> 00:04:03,405
Speaker 7:  So, so here we are. Yeah, I love it. That's, that's basically the setup.

44
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:08,165
Speaker 7:  I do have a story about ants and my sono speaker,

45
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:12,355
Speaker 7:  I should say. I've told a few people the story

46
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:16,235
Speaker 7:  and they've been beyond grossed out about it. So if you are a person

47
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:20,115
Speaker 7:  who doesn't like bugs, who is squid out about that kind of thing, this is

48
00:04:20,115 --> 00:04:21,355
Speaker 7:  maybe not the story for you.

49
00:04:23,195 --> 00:04:25,915
Speaker 7:  I don't know. How does that disclaimer hit you personally, David?

50
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:30,035
Speaker 2:  I think that's good. I would say I'm like, as long as it's not about

51
00:04:30,465 --> 00:04:32,835
Speaker 2:  spiders that can jump. I'm cool.

52
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:34,435
Speaker 7:  Crawling is fine.

53
00:04:34,555 --> 00:04:37,675
Speaker 2:  Crawling is fine as long as, as long as they are floor bound.

54
00:04:38,415 --> 00:04:41,395
Speaker 2:  But if, if they, if something can leap, we have a problem.

55
00:04:41,795 --> 00:04:44,475
Speaker 7:  I think this might be borderline for you, but we're gonna see how it goes.

56
00:04:44,755 --> 00:04:47,595
Speaker 2:  Alright, we'll see. I'm gonna, I'm gonna go with you as far as I can, but

57
00:04:47,595 --> 00:04:49,835
Speaker 2:  I may suddenly disappear from Okay, yeah.

58
00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:51,155
Speaker 7:  I'll just take it from there. Alright,

59
00:04:51,155 --> 00:04:51,675
Speaker 2:  Sounds good.

60
00:04:51,945 --> 00:04:55,795
Speaker 7:  Okay. So the, the story in brief is that before my leave ended,

61
00:04:55,975 --> 00:04:59,675
Speaker 7:  we, we took a trip with the whole family for a week. So we were gone from

62
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:03,435
Speaker 7:  the house for about a week and the day we got back, we walk in the front

63
00:05:03,435 --> 00:05:06,915
Speaker 7:  door and there's this little line of ants marching across our living room.

64
00:05:07,505 --> 00:05:11,435
Speaker 7:  This in of itself, not an unusual thing. We're dealing with ants all

65
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:15,315
Speaker 7:  the time. I recognize these particular ants specifically, they're,

66
00:05:15,425 --> 00:05:19,315
Speaker 7:  they're like an eighth of an inch. They're really small. They come up

67
00:05:19,315 --> 00:05:22,955
Speaker 7:  through our floorboards. They find snacks in the kitchen.

68
00:05:23,135 --> 00:05:25,995
Speaker 7:  We have to keep the house super clean because they're always, we're always

69
00:05:25,995 --> 00:05:29,715
Speaker 7:  kind of playing whack-a-mole with them. So we were like, ah, the answer

70
00:05:29,715 --> 00:05:33,625
Speaker 7:  back and I could see that they were headed to some dog kibble

71
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,505
Speaker 7:  that we had left in the front closet. Yeah,

72
00:05:35,505 --> 00:05:38,425
Speaker 2:  I feel like you have, you have pets and you have kids and so like answer

73
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:39,785
Speaker 2:  just sort of a fact of Yeah,

74
00:05:39,785 --> 00:05:42,865
Speaker 7:  This is like we are the, the best house on the block. Yeah. For the ants.

75
00:05:42,865 --> 00:05:46,785
Speaker 7:  Like bar none. So none of this was shocking until

76
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:50,665
Speaker 7:  I followed the little ant trail. Usually it just disappears into a crack

77
00:05:50,665 --> 00:05:54,265
Speaker 7:  in the molding or something. But this time it went across the living room

78
00:05:54,765 --> 00:05:58,725
Speaker 7:  and up onto this bench where we have these three big house plants. So I was

79
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,605
Speaker 7:  like, Ugh, God. They found the house plants. I guess they, maybe they're

80
00:06:01,605 --> 00:06:05,085
Speaker 7:  like nesting in the dirt. This is, this could be worse than I thought.

81
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:09,285
Speaker 7:  But then I kept following the trail and it didn't go into any of the house

82
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:13,045
Speaker 7:  plants. It went underneath our sono speaker,

83
00:06:13,895 --> 00:06:17,765
Speaker 7:  which is sitting right between two of the house plants. And I was like, why

84
00:06:17,765 --> 00:06:21,685
Speaker 7:  is it disappearing into the speaker? And I walk over and I lift up

85
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:25,525
Speaker 7:  the speaker and just ant explosion. Oh

86
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:25,845
Speaker 8:  No,

87
00:06:26,235 --> 00:06:29,725
Speaker 7:  Just hundreds, thousands. I don't know how to judge when

88
00:06:30,025 --> 00:06:33,645
Speaker 7:  all of a sudden, like every, every surface is moving with ants.

89
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:37,605
Speaker 7:  Too many, too many, yeah. Eggs, the whole nine yards.

90
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:42,205
Speaker 7:  I pick up the speaker and start running around with it

91
00:06:42,205 --> 00:06:46,045
Speaker 7:  like I'm holding something that's on fire. I don't wanna

92
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:49,365
Speaker 7:  set it down because there will just be ants wherever I put it. But at the

93
00:06:49,365 --> 00:06:53,205
Speaker 7:  same time, I can feel ants like crawling up my arms as I run around

94
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:57,005
Speaker 7:  with this thing. Oh, my wife is freaking out. My four month old

95
00:06:57,005 --> 00:07:00,925
Speaker 7:  baby is starting to fuss. My 3-year-old is like playing with trains or whatever.

96
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:04,885
Speaker 7:  He doesn't care, but it's, it's bedlam. So

97
00:07:05,145 --> 00:07:08,485
Speaker 7:  the closest thing I could think of to do is just sprint out the back door

98
00:07:08,485 --> 00:07:12,405
Speaker 7:  with it. So I go outside, I put it outside, I brush

99
00:07:12,405 --> 00:07:16,165
Speaker 7:  myself off, I walk in, we finish coming back from our

100
00:07:16,365 --> 00:07:17,645
Speaker 7:  vacation, a little scarred.

101
00:07:18,325 --> 00:07:19,165
Speaker 8:  I would just, I would

102
00:07:19,165 --> 00:07:23,085
Speaker 7:  Dispute the idea that this is like problem solved, but like, no, this

103
00:07:23,085 --> 00:07:26,645
Speaker 7:  is problem deferred. Yeah, sure. This is very much like, let's put pause

104
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:30,565
Speaker 7:  on this and deal with the kids. My wife incidentally

105
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:34,285
Speaker 7:  is, is one of the people who is unbelievably grossed out by

106
00:07:34,425 --> 00:07:37,685
Speaker 7:  any ants. So this is like a very traumatic moment for her fair.

107
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:41,745
Speaker 7:  Anyway, that all happened. I came back a day later,

108
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,855
Speaker 7:  blood pressure was down. I had the wherewithal to attach a microphone to

109
00:07:45,855 --> 00:07:49,735
Speaker 7:  myself this time and I brought the speaker into my garage to try

110
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,735
Speaker 7:  to take it apart and see what was going on.

111
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,215
Speaker 8:  Okay, so now the screen, oh,

112
00:07:57,235 --> 00:08:01,055
Speaker 8:  should just slide right up. Ah. Oh god.

113
00:08:01,055 --> 00:08:04,735
Speaker 8:  There's more. Oh god. Oh god. There's

114
00:08:04,765 --> 00:08:05,455
Speaker 8:  eggs, there's

115
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,295
Speaker 8:  Okay. Going outside, going outside, going outside, going outside, going outside.

116
00:08:12,715 --> 00:08:12,935
Speaker 8:  Oh

117
00:08:15,915 --> 00:08:17,575
Speaker 8:  god damn it.

118
00:08:19,195 --> 00:08:19,415
Speaker 8:  Ugh.

119
00:08:21,645 --> 00:08:21,935
Speaker 7:  Okay.

120
00:08:23,475 --> 00:08:25,895
Speaker 8:  I'm opening it up underneath the

121
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:26,135
Speaker 7:  Case.

122
00:08:27,225 --> 00:08:28,175
Speaker 8:  There are still,

123
00:08:30,235 --> 00:08:31,455
Speaker 8:  oh, there's so many ants.

124
00:08:32,565 --> 00:08:36,305
Speaker 7:  That's tough. There were still a lot of ants. It was not great. Many,

125
00:08:36,305 --> 00:08:39,865
Speaker 7:  many more ants, many, many more eggs. It was still,

126
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:44,025
Speaker 7:  it was still just a whole ecosystem. So I left it outside for

127
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:47,825
Speaker 7:  another week. I literal, I just extended the problem and forgot about it.

128
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:52,025
Speaker 7:  Did it not occur to you to just throw this thing in the trash? I was still

129
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:54,905
Speaker 7:  like, there was still a part of me that was like, I can save this speaker.

130
00:08:55,355 --> 00:08:57,605
Speaker 7:  Okay. I don's wanna let go of the speaker. I like the

131
00:08:57,605 --> 00:08:59,045
Speaker 2:  Speaker. Sono stuff is expensive. I

132
00:08:59,045 --> 00:09:01,245
Speaker 7:  Get it. Yeah. Yeah. It's, and it's, yeah, we've got two of them in the living

133
00:09:01,245 --> 00:09:05,205
Speaker 7:  room. It's, it's a whole thing. So I, I came back to

134
00:09:05,205 --> 00:09:08,605
Speaker 7:  it a week later and I like fully took it apart because I

135
00:09:08,685 --> 00:09:11,725
Speaker 7:  couldn't just assume that it was ant free.

136
00:09:13,285 --> 00:09:17,245
Speaker 7:  I probably broke it in the course of taking it apart. I haven't

137
00:09:17,245 --> 00:09:20,765
Speaker 7:  tried to put it back together, but I, I may have lost the Sonos after all,

138
00:09:21,665 --> 00:09:25,285
Speaker 7:  but the answer gone. So that is at least the end

139
00:09:25,505 --> 00:09:28,525
Speaker 7:  of that story and that speaker probably.

140
00:09:29,075 --> 00:09:29,765
Speaker 2:  Sure. Yeah.

141
00:09:30,505 --> 00:09:30,725
Speaker 7:  So

142
00:09:33,325 --> 00:09:37,125
Speaker 7:  I, that happened, time passed, but I couldn't get it outta my head. I,

143
00:09:37,325 --> 00:09:41,205
Speaker 7:  I needed to know what the heck was going on. I,

144
00:09:41,265 --> 00:09:45,045
Speaker 7:  in my head, the weird thing not being an ant was that the

145
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:48,085
Speaker 7:  speaker was sitting next to all of these lovely house plans. It just seemed

146
00:09:48,085 --> 00:09:51,805
Speaker 7:  like ants like nature, look at all this nature. Why did they choose

147
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:55,365
Speaker 7:  the Sonos out of all of these places to nest?

148
00:09:55,555 --> 00:09:58,045
Speaker 2:  Well, and it sounds like from the sound of the way you're describing it,

149
00:09:58,045 --> 00:10:01,805
Speaker 2:  it's not just like I had a bunch of ants in my speakers. It's like

150
00:10:02,465 --> 00:10:06,165
Speaker 2:  the ants of the neighborhood decided to move into my speakers. Yes.

151
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,725
Speaker 2:  Which feels different, right? Because if you were just like, I had some ants,

152
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:12,645
Speaker 2:  I have questions, I'd be like, why ants everywhere. Yeah. But this is like

153
00:10:12,825 --> 00:10:15,885
Speaker 2:  the ants as a group, like got together and decided

154
00:10:16,725 --> 00:10:17,625
Speaker 2:  to be in your speaker.

155
00:10:17,845 --> 00:10:21,065
Speaker 7:  It was a different thing. Yeah. It was different from the, like the answer

156
00:10:21,065 --> 00:10:22,625
Speaker 7:  back that we've experienced before.

157
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,545
Speaker 2:  Yeah. There was a meeting about it in which the ants picture speaker and

158
00:10:25,545 --> 00:10:25,745
Speaker 2:  we're

159
00:10:25,745 --> 00:10:29,545
Speaker 7:  Like, this is the place. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, absolutely. So I got curious and

160
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:33,225
Speaker 7:  I just googled ants in Sonos and I've,

161
00:10:33,295 --> 00:10:35,145
Speaker 7:  it's the internet. I found stuff, good

162
00:10:35,145 --> 00:10:35,905
Speaker 2:  Reporting tactic.

163
00:10:36,105 --> 00:10:39,985
Speaker 7:  I found a lot of stuff. There are all these forum posts on

164
00:10:39,985 --> 00:10:43,545
Speaker 7:  the Sonos website with people with the exact same problem.

165
00:10:43,965 --> 00:10:47,865
Speaker 7:  And in many times, my exact model, the Sonos play one, like

166
00:10:47,865 --> 00:10:51,705
Speaker 7:  there are many Sonos play one customers with

167
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:55,865
Speaker 7:  ant problems over the past few years. Weird other stuff on Reddit.

168
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:59,625
Speaker 7:  Like it's a thing. And all of these forum posters are just

169
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:03,185
Speaker 7:  sitting on these sites trading theories about

170
00:11:03,335 --> 00:11:07,305
Speaker 7:  what is going on. Some people thought there might be a glue in

171
00:11:07,305 --> 00:11:11,025
Speaker 7:  the electronics that they like, they thought the electronics could generate

172
00:11:11,215 --> 00:11:14,985
Speaker 7:  heat and maybe the ants like that. There's this theory bouncing around that

173
00:11:15,265 --> 00:11:19,105
Speaker 7:  ants might be attracted to magnetic fields for some reason. Ooh. Like

174
00:11:19,975 --> 00:11:23,715
Speaker 7:  it was going places. Everyone was also trading a lot of theories about

175
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:27,555
Speaker 7:  how to get rid of them. 'cause they, you know, someone suggested

176
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:31,275
Speaker 7:  they've just put the Sonos in a freezer for a while, but people

177
00:11:31,345 --> 00:11:35,235
Speaker 7:  also don't want a speaker full of dead ants. Right. Like, that's not

178
00:11:35,275 --> 00:11:36,235
Speaker 7:  a great solution either.

179
00:11:36,615 --> 00:11:39,795
Speaker 2:  If you want to get rid of the ants and also destroy your speaker. Like that's

180
00:11:39,795 --> 00:11:41,755
Speaker 2:  a, that's an easier problem to solve. Yeah.

181
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:45,635
Speaker 7:  Yeah, exactly. So there's, there's a lot of talk about how to maybe

182
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:49,555
Speaker 7:  bully the ants out of the speakers with, with an air conditioner

183
00:11:49,695 --> 00:11:52,755
Speaker 7:  or a heater or a fan yell

184
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:54,485
Speaker 2:  Offensive things at them through the speaker

185
00:11:55,355 --> 00:11:59,165
Speaker 7:  Play. Playing Ed Sheeran through the speaker was one suggestion that got

186
00:11:59,165 --> 00:11:59,645
Speaker 7:  some traction.

187
00:12:01,225 --> 00:12:04,725
Speaker 7:  The zaniest one was, for some reason people thought that maybe if you

188
00:12:04,795 --> 00:12:08,405
Speaker 7:  suspend the speakers over a bucket of water, but provide a bridge

189
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:12,845
Speaker 7:  away from the speaker. There's something about that setup that ants might

190
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:16,125
Speaker 7:  not like. It's, It is people just doing their best.

191
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:16,605
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

192
00:12:16,755 --> 00:12:20,485
Speaker 7:  With not a ton of information and a speaker full of ants. So

193
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:25,085
Speaker 7:  I set out to answer this question for myself, for the people on the internet,

194
00:12:25,905 --> 00:12:29,685
Speaker 7:  the two questions I had, one was just kind

195
00:12:29,845 --> 00:12:33,605
Speaker 7:  of, how specific is this problem? Like if you google

196
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:37,605
Speaker 7:  around, you can find lots of examples of ants getting into electronics.

197
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:41,765
Speaker 7:  So my question is, is this a problem with electronics

198
00:12:41,765 --> 00:12:45,325
Speaker 7:  and bugs? Is this a problem with ants and speakers, or is this a problem

199
00:12:45,325 --> 00:12:49,125
Speaker 7:  with this kind of ant and this kind of speaker? Like what

200
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,885
Speaker 7:  scale of problem are we dealing with here?

201
00:12:51,545 --> 00:12:55,125
Speaker 2:  I'm trying to imagine where you even start on this. 'cause I, I like, I like

202
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,365
Speaker 2:  that the place you go is like, am I the only person this has ever happened

203
00:12:57,365 --> 00:13:01,015
Speaker 2:  to? Yes. And you, you determine No, but I can't imagine there's like

204
00:13:01,455 --> 00:13:05,295
Speaker 2:  a, a copious body of scientific research on the ant qualities

205
00:13:05,395 --> 00:13:09,055
Speaker 2:  of, and I can't imagine like Sonos has thought about this particular, like,

206
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:09,655
Speaker 2:  where do you start?

207
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,535
Speaker 7:  No, Sonos did respond to a couple of the forum posts with basically just

208
00:13:13,535 --> 00:13:17,495
Speaker 7:  like, try your home warranty like this, this, this cannot be

209
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:20,495
Speaker 7:  a Sonos problem. Like, we refuse to make this a Sonos problem.

210
00:13:22,675 --> 00:13:26,535
Speaker 7:  So I, I also just really wanted to know what to do

211
00:13:26,535 --> 00:13:30,095
Speaker 7:  about it. Like, this was such an escalation from the ant

212
00:13:30,095 --> 00:13:33,975
Speaker 7:  situations that I've dealt with in my house. I all of a sudden start

213
00:13:33,975 --> 00:13:37,815
Speaker 7:  looking around at my like Roku box on the tv.

214
00:13:38,135 --> 00:13:41,495
Speaker 7:  The TV itself, I just felt like nothing was safe anymore. Oh yeah.

215
00:13:41,495 --> 00:13:45,135
Speaker 2:  You're like every, everything closed is like crawling with ants inside. Ugh.

216
00:13:45,135 --> 00:13:45,415
Speaker 2:  Right.

217
00:13:45,415 --> 00:13:48,775
Speaker 7:  And if and if there is something specific to electronics, then like, yeah.

218
00:13:48,805 --> 00:13:50,895
Speaker 7:  This, this could go a lot of bad places. Ugh.

219
00:13:50,925 --> 00:13:54,015
Speaker 2:  This officially just became my least favorite segment we've ever done. Like,

220
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:55,735
Speaker 2:  now I'm thinking about all the things. Yeah, you're still

221
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:59,615
Speaker 7:  Here, but Yeah, I can feel your mouse sort of like hovering over the exit

222
00:13:59,615 --> 00:14:00,255
Speaker 7:  box. All

223
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:02,375
Speaker 2:  Right, we're coming back. I'm ready. Okay. I'm back in. All right.

224
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:05,375
Speaker 7:  So we're gonna, we're gonna learn some things. It's gonna be fun. All right.

225
00:14:05,915 --> 00:14:09,895
Speaker 7:  The, the place that I started, which turned out to be really fruitful

226
00:14:10,315 --> 00:14:14,095
Speaker 7:  was entomologists. I, I live in the Seattle area,

227
00:14:14,235 --> 00:14:18,015
Speaker 7:  so I, I reached out to the entomology department at Washington State

228
00:14:18,015 --> 00:14:21,775
Speaker 7:  University. I figured someone regional might have a good sense of

229
00:14:22,105 --> 00:14:25,735
Speaker 7:  local ad populations. So I emailed the

230
00:14:25,735 --> 00:14:27,815
Speaker 7:  department. What

231
00:14:27,815 --> 00:14:28,935
Speaker 2:  Does that cold email say?

232
00:14:29,855 --> 00:14:32,655
Speaker 7:  I mean, it was really straightforward. This is the, the, the best thing about

233
00:14:32,655 --> 00:14:36,375
Speaker 7:  doing my job is I can just send insane emails as if they're

234
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,975
Speaker 7:  completely normal as, hi, I am a technology journalist and I have a bunch

235
00:14:39,975 --> 00:14:43,575
Speaker 7:  of ants in my speakers and I was wondering if an entomologist could

236
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:47,895
Speaker 7:  give me some tips about that. And true to form, they

237
00:14:47,895 --> 00:14:51,525
Speaker 7:  were like, absolutely. They put me in touch with a

238
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:54,365
Speaker 7:  master's student that had just graduated named Sam Dday.

239
00:14:55,785 --> 00:14:59,325
Speaker 7:  She specializes in, in what they call you social

240
00:14:59,515 --> 00:15:03,165
Speaker 7:  insects. These are insects like bees and ants that have queens

241
00:15:03,305 --> 00:15:06,325
Speaker 7:  and casts and colonies and that kind of social structure.

242
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:10,605
Speaker 7:  She was super into the question. She had some

243
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:15,405
Speaker 7:  experience with this kind of thing. And her first

244
00:15:15,435 --> 00:15:19,285
Speaker 7:  step with me was identifying the species of ant. It

245
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:23,005
Speaker 7:  was like, let's figure out what kind of ant this is and that'll tell us a

246
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,325
Speaker 7:  bunch about why they went and did this thing to you. Okay.

247
00:15:27,025 --> 00:15:27,245
Speaker 7:  How,

248
00:15:27,245 --> 00:15:29,165
Speaker 2:  How does one identify a species of, and

249
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:32,205
Speaker 7:  Well, a bunch of different ways. Okay. She had some suspicions just based

250
00:15:32,205 --> 00:15:35,845
Speaker 7:  on where I live and the story that I told. Basically their

251
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:39,805
Speaker 7:  behavior. She also asked for a closeup photo. So I got as, as

252
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:43,765
Speaker 7:  macro a photo as I could Nice of, of a dead one and sent them along to her

253
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:48,605
Speaker 7:  and then she suggested that I crush some of them up and smell them.

254
00:15:49,985 --> 00:15:51,005
Speaker 7:  My god. Which,

255
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:52,485
Speaker 2:  Speaking of bullying, the ants,

256
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:57,445
Speaker 7:  I found a bunch of dead ones. Okay. I collect, I just, I just shook the

257
00:15:57,445 --> 00:16:01,285
Speaker 7:  speaker out onto a piece of paper, collected a bunch of dead ones.

258
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:05,725
Speaker 7:  The trouble is I have a condition called a nasia. I

259
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:09,125
Speaker 7:  basically have no sense of smell. This is a fun fact about me. So I was out

260
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:12,925
Speaker 7:  of the running to perform this particular experiment. So

261
00:16:13,025 --> 00:16:15,845
Speaker 7:  the next best person was my already traumatized wife,

262
00:16:16,885 --> 00:16:20,605
Speaker 7:  Caroline, who was a real champ when I got a bunch of ant

263
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:23,245
Speaker 7:  carcasses and asked her to smell them.

264
00:16:23,915 --> 00:16:27,685
Speaker 9:  Okay. I'm just gonna crush them with the back of the spoon. And then

265
00:16:27,685 --> 00:16:30,805
Speaker 9:  you're gonna take a big sniff and tell me if you smell anything.

266
00:16:31,555 --> 00:16:31,845
Speaker 10:  Okay.

267
00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:33,005
Speaker 9:  Okay. Ready?

268
00:16:34,985 --> 00:16:38,845
Speaker 10:  Oh, it's not a bad smell,

269
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,765
Speaker 10:  but I do smell a thing.

270
00:16:40,995 --> 00:16:42,165
Speaker 9:  What does it smell like?

271
00:16:43,205 --> 00:16:45,405
Speaker 10:  I will need a second sniff. Get

272
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:45,605
Speaker 9:  In there.

273
00:16:46,915 --> 00:16:50,565
Speaker 10:  It's kind of lemony. Oh, is that,

274
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:54,005
Speaker 9:  I don't know. I don't know what they're supposed to smell like.

275
00:16:55,105 --> 00:16:56,645
Speaker 10:  Oh God. Did I get Ed on my nose?

276
00:16:59,505 --> 00:17:00,275
Speaker 2:  Your poor wife?

277
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:01,555
Speaker 7:  My poor wife

278
00:17:01,915 --> 00:17:02,995
Speaker 2:  Caroline. Thank you. We're all

279
00:17:03,235 --> 00:17:05,875
Speaker 7:  Grateful of all the debuts for to The Vergecast

280
00:17:07,575 --> 00:17:08,715
Speaker 7:  for the science. Okay. So

281
00:17:08,715 --> 00:17:11,195
Speaker 2:  We have some evidence though. We have, we have a lemony smell,

282
00:17:11,535 --> 00:17:15,235
Speaker 7:  We have a lemony smell, we have a photo, we have behavior.

283
00:17:15,655 --> 00:17:18,995
Speaker 7:  We have a lot. Yeah. So I sort of collated all of that and finally

284
00:17:19,575 --> 00:17:23,535
Speaker 7:  called Sam up on the phone to talk about it. She got like a

285
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:27,775
Speaker 7:  citrusy lemony smell. Hmm. Does that track with your

286
00:17:27,775 --> 00:17:28,335
Speaker 7:  experience?

287
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:32,055
Speaker 11:  You know, everyone smells something different. Oh,

288
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:36,735
Speaker 11:  the smell that people reference a lot is rotten coconut.

289
00:17:37,435 --> 00:17:39,055
Speaker 11:  Oh. Or blue cheese.

290
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:42,415
Speaker 7:  Okay. That's different than lemons. Yeah.

291
00:17:42,415 --> 00:17:43,935
Speaker 11:  That is very different than lemons.

292
00:17:45,655 --> 00:17:47,495
Speaker 11:  I think it almost smells like turpentine.

293
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:52,255
Speaker 7:  So based on the story, the behavior, the description, the photo,

294
00:17:52,715 --> 00:17:56,415
Speaker 7:  the fact that there was a smell, even if it wasn't the most expected one,

295
00:17:56,835 --> 00:18:00,255
Speaker 7:  all of this made Sam really confident that we were dealing with something

296
00:18:00,255 --> 00:18:04,015
Speaker 7:  called Theodorus house Ant or Oja, OHA.

297
00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:08,375
Speaker 2:  Okay. Is that like when I think of an ant, is that the ant I'm thinking

298
00:18:08,415 --> 00:18:10,775
Speaker 2:  of? Do you know what I mean? It's like everybody has like the ant in their

299
00:18:10,775 --> 00:18:11,815
Speaker 2:  house. Is this that ant?

300
00:18:12,015 --> 00:18:15,455
Speaker 7:  I think it depends. Okay. I think there's a really good chance that if it's

301
00:18:15,615 --> 00:18:19,535
Speaker 7:  a really small ant that is constantly annoying you in your

302
00:18:19,535 --> 00:18:23,095
Speaker 7:  house, there's a good chance that it's an Noha. Okay. 'cause they're native

303
00:18:23,155 --> 00:18:27,055
Speaker 7:  to North America, they're found all over the continent. They're very

304
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:30,655
Speaker 7:  common. There are other ants that get confused with uhhas, but

305
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:34,695
Speaker 7:  this is a really common one. They live the, like I

306
00:18:34,695 --> 00:18:38,655
Speaker 7:  said, they're, they're these social creatures. They live in really big colonies

307
00:18:38,655 --> 00:18:42,535
Speaker 7:  with a few queens and thousands and thousands of workers that run all over

308
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:44,855
Speaker 7:  the place and do cooperative colony things.

309
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:49,935
Speaker 7:  They're super, super common in homes, hence the name. And

310
00:18:49,935 --> 00:18:53,895
Speaker 7:  they're really interesting to entomologists right now because in North

311
00:18:53,895 --> 00:18:56,415
Speaker 7:  America they're undergoing this kind of mysterious shift

312
00:18:57,335 --> 00:18:59,335
Speaker 11:  Odors, haans in their natural

313
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:03,735
Speaker 11:  environment, which is in wooded areas.

314
00:19:04,445 --> 00:19:08,095
Speaker 11:  They usually will only have one, maybe a handful

315
00:19:08,235 --> 00:19:12,055
Speaker 11:  of queens, very small colonies. And what

316
00:19:12,055 --> 00:19:15,575
Speaker 11:  we've seen in the last 10 or 15 years is that

317
00:19:16,315 --> 00:19:20,215
Speaker 11:  in urban environments, the ris Haan starts kind

318
00:19:20,215 --> 00:19:23,655
Speaker 11:  of changing how it reacts. So our

319
00:19:23,905 --> 00:19:27,535
Speaker 11:  nests are now made up of hundreds of thousands

320
00:19:27,755 --> 00:19:31,415
Speaker 11:  of queens and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of, of

321
00:19:31,415 --> 00:19:35,255
Speaker 11:  workers in these urban environments. So

322
00:19:35,255 --> 00:19:38,735
Speaker 11:  that's part of what makes them so difficult to treat. It's just the size

323
00:19:38,735 --> 00:19:42,415
Speaker 11:  of them. And it's not just one single nest that

324
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:46,215
Speaker 11:  they're staying in. It's multiple interconnected super colonies

325
00:19:46,565 --> 00:19:50,175
Speaker 11:  that are forming in your backyard, in your neighbor's backyard,

326
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:54,215
Speaker 11:  in your neighbor's neighbor's backyard. Yeah. Pretty much just

327
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:58,615
Speaker 11:  entrenching a whole area in a cooperative nest, which is

328
00:19:58,935 --> 00:20:00,175
Speaker 11:  crazy. Very interesting.

329
00:20:00,955 --> 00:20:04,775
Speaker 7:  So that's all kind of a mystery. What we do know is

330
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:08,615
Speaker 7:  that they just have a lot of reasons to like suburban or urban

331
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:12,535
Speaker 7:  areas. There's human food and pet food all over the place. Toddler

332
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:16,615
Speaker 7:  crumbs, nice heated homes. And then homes have all these

333
00:20:16,805 --> 00:20:20,095
Speaker 7:  nice little nooks and crannies inside to, to live.

334
00:20:20,755 --> 00:20:24,295
Speaker 11:  If you can think of a house in your basement and your kitchen

335
00:20:24,635 --> 00:20:28,335
Speaker 11:  and your bathrooms, those are ideal spots for our

336
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:32,335
Speaker 11:  ods house sand. They want to live there just as much as we do.

337
00:20:32,775 --> 00:20:33,975
Speaker 11:  They find it just as nice.

338
00:20:35,195 --> 00:20:39,135
Speaker 7:  So knowing what Sam knows about Ojas, she was

339
00:20:39,135 --> 00:20:42,095
Speaker 7:  not remotely surprised about this story that I told her.

340
00:20:43,165 --> 00:20:46,485
Speaker 11:  I mean, this is the calling card of Ris

341
00:20:46,815 --> 00:20:50,725
Speaker 11:  Haans is that they seem to just appear

342
00:20:51,065 --> 00:20:54,525
Speaker 11:  one day and it's because they are so transient

343
00:20:54,935 --> 00:20:58,445
Speaker 11:  about every two weeks they are constantly moving their nests.

344
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:02,565
Speaker 11:  And unlike other ants that will find the food source,

345
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:06,165
Speaker 11:  take bits of it, bring it back to the nest for

346
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:10,765
Speaker 11:  distributing, haws don't do that. They don't take the food to

347
00:21:10,765 --> 00:21:14,725
Speaker 11:  the brood. They take the brood to the food. The

348
00:21:14,725 --> 00:21:18,525
Speaker 11:  speaker is situated in a perfect place that they can easily

349
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:21,165
Speaker 11:  get to the dog food in your, in your closet

350
00:21:22,385 --> 00:21:25,965
Speaker 11:  scraps in the, the kitchen. So they just

351
00:21:26,105 --> 00:21:30,045
Speaker 11:  really found this one place and were like, this is perfect. And

352
00:21:30,185 --> 00:21:34,165
Speaker 11:  you say that it took you about a week for them to move. And that's on

353
00:21:34,175 --> 00:21:38,045
Speaker 11:  brand. I don't know if it rained before or during that time

354
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:42,205
Speaker 11:  when you were gone, but rain is, It is definitely one of those that

355
00:21:42,555 --> 00:21:46,085
Speaker 11:  elicits them wanting to, to move around. And Seattle

356
00:21:46,335 --> 00:21:48,245
Speaker 11:  being one of the wettest places out there

357
00:21:48,905 --> 00:21:52,605
Speaker 7:  All the time. Yeah, yeah. So they're, that might be constantly sort of

358
00:21:52,605 --> 00:21:53,445
Speaker 7:  scrambling them.

359
00:21:53,915 --> 00:21:56,885
Speaker 11:  Exactly. So weather, food, resources,

360
00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:00,965
Speaker 11:  and also just the seasons as well.

361
00:22:01,815 --> 00:22:05,765
Speaker 11:  March is when they, everything is coming to life. It's

362
00:22:05,995 --> 00:22:09,405
Speaker 11:  when we're getting out and stretching our legs. And it's the same with our

363
00:22:09,535 --> 00:22:13,285
Speaker 11:  aunts. They're, those little ladies are, are trying to find new

364
00:22:13,295 --> 00:22:17,165
Speaker 11:  homes and they're trying to expand their numbers while

365
00:22:17,165 --> 00:22:19,325
Speaker 11:  the weather's nice and the resources are available.

366
00:22:20,385 --> 00:22:24,045
Speaker 2:  So I feel like this explains why they're around,

367
00:22:24,155 --> 00:22:27,965
Speaker 2:  like sort of why they'd show up at all. But have we answered yet

368
00:22:27,965 --> 00:22:31,525
Speaker 2:  why they would pick a speaker or I guess More specifically a

369
00:22:31,615 --> 00:22:35,445
Speaker 2:  Sonos play one? I really hope this mystery ends with some

370
00:22:35,835 --> 00:22:39,405
Speaker 2:  play one specific stuff. But it does feel like I, I get it,

371
00:22:39,995 --> 00:22:41,375
Speaker 2:  but do we know the speaker bit yet?

372
00:22:41,955 --> 00:22:44,455
Speaker 7:  We, we have not gotten to the speaker bit yet, but okay,

373
00:22:44,525 --> 00:22:45,055
Speaker 2:  Here we go.

374
00:22:45,085 --> 00:22:46,375
Speaker 7:  Okay. Here's the speaker bit.

375
00:22:47,195 --> 00:22:51,115
Speaker 11:  I did see a bunch of of people having the same problem with that

376
00:22:51,605 --> 00:22:54,475
Speaker 11:  exact speaker. Really? And yes. And

377
00:22:55,455 --> 00:22:59,395
Speaker 11:  you know, if I put on my, my ant glasses and look at things

378
00:22:59,535 --> 00:23:00,635
Speaker 11:  as if I were a worker,

379
00:23:00,975 --> 00:23:02,715
Speaker 7:  Please, this is exactly what I need.

380
00:23:03,505 --> 00:23:06,875
Speaker 11:  That is the perfect housing. Is that speaker

381
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:11,355
Speaker 7:  What? Tell me everything. What like you the ant, why is this seventh

382
00:23:11,355 --> 00:23:14,755
Speaker 7:  heaven for you when you like discover a Sonos? Yeah. Play one.

383
00:23:15,465 --> 00:23:19,235
Speaker 11:  Well, as I'm looking at it and, and when you were pulling it apart, it has

384
00:23:19,275 --> 00:23:22,755
Speaker 11:  a lot of crevices in it. It had a lot of little spaces where

385
00:23:23,295 --> 00:23:27,115
Speaker 11:  as an aunt I would be happy to place a bunch of brood in there,

386
00:23:27,465 --> 00:23:31,355
Speaker 11:  make sure it's nice and moist in there for them. It's easy to climate control.

387
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:35,595
Speaker 11:  It's a dark color. So if the sun is hitting it, it's gonna

388
00:23:35,595 --> 00:23:39,555
Speaker 11:  warm it up inside there. Make it nice and like tropical for

389
00:23:39,555 --> 00:23:42,195
Speaker 11:  me. That's perfect. That's seventh heaven To me.

390
00:23:42,985 --> 00:23:46,125
Speaker 7:  The thing that I realized after learning all this is, is I think the reason

391
00:23:46,185 --> 00:23:50,085
Speaker 7:  the Sonos made no sense for me as a human for

392
00:23:50,085 --> 00:23:53,925
Speaker 7:  an ant colony was because I picture ants digging

393
00:23:54,035 --> 00:23:57,805
Speaker 7:  tunnels and building nest. Like I, I think I was thinking about ant farm

394
00:23:58,205 --> 00:24:01,845
Speaker 7:  ants. Same. And that's just not ojas, that's just not their

395
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:05,885
Speaker 7:  behavior. They don't build their own extensive nests. They look for

396
00:24:05,985 --> 00:24:09,685
Speaker 7:  spaces that just work for them. They look for confined protected

397
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:13,685
Speaker 7:  spots and they just go to town. So the

398
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:17,525
Speaker 7:  inside of a speaker is great for them. They also, in

399
00:24:17,525 --> 00:24:21,405
Speaker 7:  your house love the voids between walls. They love the little spaces inside

400
00:24:21,495 --> 00:24:24,965
Speaker 7:  power outlets. They like little crevices around water pipes.

401
00:24:25,595 --> 00:24:29,485
Speaker 11:  I've heard stories of people coming back from the weekend and finding

402
00:24:29,965 --> 00:24:33,045
Speaker 11:  odor alsan colonies underneath their calculator at work.

403
00:24:34,025 --> 00:24:38,015
Speaker 7:  There was another thing though, that Sam really zeroed in on

404
00:24:38,385 --> 00:24:42,175
Speaker 7:  about this specific Sonos speaker. Nice. And, and others

405
00:24:42,405 --> 00:24:43,175
Speaker 7:  that are like it.

406
00:24:43,975 --> 00:24:47,895
Speaker 11:  I noticed that there's some speakers that have like the fabric

407
00:24:48,395 --> 00:24:52,335
Speaker 11:  that's over the speaker head. This one doesn't, this one has

408
00:24:52,335 --> 00:24:54,215
Speaker 11:  those tiny little holes and they look,

409
00:24:54,215 --> 00:24:55,455
Speaker 7:  It's got a little metal grill. Yeah.

410
00:24:55,825 --> 00:24:59,655
Speaker 11:  Those are perfect size for me. That is an entrance to

411
00:24:59,955 --> 00:25:03,895
Speaker 11:  the lobby, you know, that that was made for me to enter.

412
00:25:04,955 --> 00:25:08,655
Speaker 11:  So the, those answers seeing this tiny crevice and they're seeing

413
00:25:08,795 --> 00:25:11,655
Speaker 11:  the, the warmth in there and the electricity.

414
00:25:12,535 --> 00:25:16,355
Speaker 2:  So the electricity is part, I honestly like of all the crackpot

415
00:25:16,355 --> 00:25:19,555
Speaker 2:  theories you described at the top, this sounded like the most crackpot of

416
00:25:19,555 --> 00:25:22,155
Speaker 2:  the crackpot theories. And you're telling me the electricity is real.

417
00:25:22,665 --> 00:25:26,515
Speaker 7:  Same. I I was completely skeptical that there was

418
00:25:26,515 --> 00:25:30,395
Speaker 7:  something like about the magnetic fields and insects. It

419
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:34,315
Speaker 7:  just seemed like totally outta left field. But Sam

420
00:25:34,415 --> 00:25:35,235
Speaker 7:  had thoughts on that.

421
00:25:36,225 --> 00:25:40,085
Speaker 11:  It hasn't been looked at specifically in ojas, but it has

422
00:25:40,085 --> 00:25:43,685
Speaker 11:  been looked at in other ant species where they are

423
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,645
Speaker 11:  actually attracted to magnetic fields

424
00:25:49,025 --> 00:25:53,005
Speaker 11:  or the voltage. There's a couple of different trains of thought when it

425
00:25:53,005 --> 00:25:56,645
Speaker 11:  comes to that one with the electricity, there's a

426
00:25:56,645 --> 00:26:00,605
Speaker 11:  slight heat increase. So some ants might

427
00:26:00,605 --> 00:26:03,405
Speaker 11:  be perceiving it as a slightly warmer environment.

428
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:07,885
Speaker 11:  There's also some evidence that should suggests when

429
00:26:08,245 --> 00:26:11,925
Speaker 11:  ants get into electronics, they're more likely to get shocked.

430
00:26:12,545 --> 00:26:16,285
Speaker 11:  And when they get shocked, they released a pheromone. And that

431
00:26:16,315 --> 00:26:20,005
Speaker 11:  pheromone is then attracting more ants. Those

432
00:26:20,285 --> 00:26:23,925
Speaker 11:  ants are more likely gonna get shocked and they're gonna release the

433
00:26:23,925 --> 00:26:27,685
Speaker 11:  pheromone that's going to attract even more ants. And it's a vicious cycle.

434
00:26:28,345 --> 00:26:31,805
Speaker 11:  And so it's this pheromone that's being released, that's making this behavior

435
00:26:33,145 --> 00:26:37,125
Speaker 11:  to say, come here, come here. But it's an interesting thing and, and it's

436
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:41,005
Speaker 11:  only been looked at in a couple of studies about what is it? And they

437
00:26:41,065 --> 00:26:44,685
Speaker 11:  did see an increase in attractiveness

438
00:26:44,905 --> 00:26:46,765
Speaker 11:  as the voltage increased.

439
00:26:47,225 --> 00:26:50,845
Speaker 7:  Gotcha. So they're noticing an attraction to electricity. And the,

440
00:26:51,545 --> 00:26:54,765
Speaker 7:  the, the possible reasons for that are the heat,

441
00:26:55,545 --> 00:26:57,885
Speaker 7:  the, the, the shocking.

442
00:26:59,105 --> 00:27:02,885
Speaker 11:  Or a third thing, like I, they're, they could be picking up on a magnetic

443
00:27:02,975 --> 00:27:06,805
Speaker 11:  field that is eliciting some kind of response that we

444
00:27:06,805 --> 00:27:07,565
Speaker 11:  don't understand.

445
00:27:09,185 --> 00:27:13,165
Speaker 11:  You know, I'm, I'm not an ant I I'm an ant person, but I

446
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:17,085
Speaker 11:  can't necessarily think exactly like an ant. So there could be some third

447
00:27:17,145 --> 00:27:18,965
Speaker 11:  reason behind this.

448
00:27:19,885 --> 00:27:23,565
Speaker 2:  I wonder if Sam frequently has to remind herself that she's not an aunt.

449
00:27:23,755 --> 00:27:26,245
Speaker 2:  That seems like the kind of thing that as an entomologist, you every once

450
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:30,085
Speaker 2:  in a while have to be like, It is true. I'm not an an like she says that

451
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:32,965
Speaker 2:  sort of reminding you, but also sort of reminding herself. You know what

452
00:27:32,965 --> 00:27:33,365
Speaker 2:  I mean? Yeah.

453
00:27:33,365 --> 00:27:36,205
Speaker 7:  Well she kinda went back and forth between, well I'm not an aunt, but if

454
00:27:36,325 --> 00:27:40,165
Speaker 7:  I were an aunt in a way that you really felt like

455
00:27:40,185 --> 00:27:42,845
Speaker 7:  she was in inhabiting this position. Yeah.

456
00:27:43,345 --> 00:27:47,205
Speaker 2:  So is this satisfying to you? Like do you feel like this

457
00:27:47,205 --> 00:27:50,885
Speaker 2:  is, this is sort of the, the complete answer. It, it feels like,

458
00:27:51,525 --> 00:27:54,085
Speaker 2:  I understand now why they might pick your speaker in particular,

459
00:27:55,785 --> 00:27:58,925
Speaker 2:  but does it feel like you've gotten all the way to the end of the answer?

460
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:03,485
Speaker 7:  It kind of did. Yeah. I honestly wasn't expecting to get quite this far.

461
00:28:03,745 --> 00:28:07,605
Speaker 7:  But it, after talking to Sam, it felt like yes

462
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:10,845
Speaker 7:  It is these specific ants that are doing this.

463
00:28:11,585 --> 00:28:15,125
Speaker 7:  And this specific speaker definitely has some

464
00:28:15,225 --> 00:28:19,045
Speaker 7:  traits that they love. So I don't, to me it really

465
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:22,805
Speaker 7:  does explain all of those forum posts on the Sonos website.

466
00:28:22,805 --> 00:28:26,485
Speaker 7:  Like it's, it's not just this speaker. There's all kinds of

467
00:28:26,485 --> 00:28:30,445
Speaker 7:  electronics that have grills and little cubbies and are, you know, have magnetic

468
00:28:30,445 --> 00:28:34,005
Speaker 7:  fields. But this speaker of mine definitely

469
00:28:34,215 --> 00:28:37,245
Speaker 7:  ticks all of these different boxes for the ants.

470
00:28:37,555 --> 00:28:41,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It's kind of the, it's like the perfect storm for ant

471
00:28:41,365 --> 00:28:44,485
Speaker 2:  attraction where the kids Absolutely. Lots of electronics do sort of one

472
00:28:44,485 --> 00:28:47,845
Speaker 2:  or two of the things you just described, but the, the play one is sort of

473
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:51,485
Speaker 2:  the perfect center of the Venn diagram of all the things that those ants

474
00:28:51,485 --> 00:28:51,885
Speaker 2:  like deliver.

475
00:28:51,955 --> 00:28:55,365
Speaker 7:  Exactly. And so that's the thing that just completely flipped my thinking

476
00:28:55,405 --> 00:28:59,205
Speaker 7:  180 degrees from like of all the places. Why the Sonos to like,

477
00:28:59,545 --> 00:29:00,965
Speaker 7:  oh yeah, no, it would be the Sonos.

478
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:07,485
Speaker 2:  So you destroyed your play one, we think. I'm very curious

479
00:29:07,485 --> 00:29:09,325
Speaker 2:  to know when you put it back together, how it goes. Yeah,

480
00:29:09,325 --> 00:29:12,765
Speaker 7:  I'll, I'll follow up with that, but I don't have high hopes. It, it was done

481
00:29:12,765 --> 00:29:14,925
Speaker 7:  sort of in a, a fit of mania. Yeah.

482
00:29:14,985 --> 00:29:18,845
Speaker 2:  But knowing what you know now, outside of full

483
00:29:18,845 --> 00:29:22,725
Speaker 2:  panic, heaved the thing into the yard, what would you do? What, like for

484
00:29:22,725 --> 00:29:25,445
Speaker 2:  all the people who are on these forums trying to figure it out, what is the

485
00:29:25,445 --> 00:29:26,565
Speaker 2:  right answer? How do you get the answer out?

486
00:29:26,905 --> 00:29:30,765
Speaker 7:  So it turns out I, in my own panic, I was kind of on the right

487
00:29:30,765 --> 00:29:34,725
Speaker 7:  track. Well, so let's talk about getting them out. Yes. I think I might

488
00:29:34,755 --> 00:29:38,525
Speaker 7:  have lucked into a solution, but if someone came to you

489
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:42,865
Speaker 7:  and said, my speaker is full of ants, what would you tell

490
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:43,265
Speaker 7:  them to do?

491
00:29:44,065 --> 00:29:47,545
Speaker 11:  I think you, you did the right thing. You got them outta your house and

492
00:29:47,545 --> 00:29:50,385
Speaker 11:  gave them time to move all their brood out.

493
00:29:51,445 --> 00:29:55,425
Speaker 11:  You just have made it an environment that's not what they want

494
00:29:55,425 --> 00:29:55,785
Speaker 11:  anymore.

495
00:29:56,565 --> 00:30:00,435
Speaker 7:  So I mean, basically the advice is leverage that

496
00:30:00,435 --> 00:30:04,395
Speaker 7:  fact that we learned that they move around pretty regularly anyway. Just

497
00:30:04,545 --> 00:30:07,715
Speaker 7:  move the nest outside and wait for them to just wander off.

498
00:30:08,455 --> 00:30:12,395
Speaker 7:  If you can't move the nest, then you're in kind of ant trap territory or

499
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:14,595
Speaker 7:  calling in a professional or something like that.

500
00:30:16,135 --> 00:30:20,035
Speaker 7:  As for all those other ideas in the forum, San said that trying to

501
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:23,755
Speaker 7:  bully them out with heat and cold is kind of tricky because

502
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:27,515
Speaker 7:  they're just so resilient. Like, she told me this story about

503
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:31,195
Speaker 7:  how the thermostat in her lab went haywire one weekend

504
00:30:31,775 --> 00:30:35,555
Speaker 7:  and just cooked her whole lab at like a hundred plus degrees Whoa. A weekend.

505
00:30:35,575 --> 00:30:39,355
Speaker 7:  And she came back and all of her aunt colonies were dead except for the

506
00:30:39,465 --> 00:30:43,435
Speaker 7:  ohas, which were just, oh my gosh. Chugging along. So you might have

507
00:30:43,435 --> 00:30:46,275
Speaker 7:  a hard time with extreme temperatures with them specifically.

508
00:30:46,705 --> 00:30:47,235
Speaker 2:  Fair enough.

509
00:30:47,455 --> 00:30:50,875
Speaker 7:  And she did not know what to make of the bucket of water trick. That is just

510
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:54,155
Speaker 7:  gonna be the, the last enduring mystery of this story. So the, the

511
00:30:54,475 --> 00:30:57,955
Speaker 2:  Electricity theorists are gonna be unbearable on these forums now is what

512
00:30:57,955 --> 00:30:58,275
Speaker 2:  I'm hearing.

513
00:30:58,385 --> 00:31:00,275
Speaker 7:  Yeah, yeah. We just added a lot of fuel to that.

514
00:31:00,345 --> 00:31:03,595
Speaker 2:  What about, can you just play really loud music, like my immediate instinct

515
00:31:03,615 --> 00:31:07,275
Speaker 2:  was just like, put on something bassy, turn it up to a hundred

516
00:31:07,775 --> 00:31:10,915
Speaker 2:  and see if you can just like bounce them out of the speaker. Did you ask

517
00:31:10,915 --> 00:31:11,875
Speaker 2:  Sam about this? I

518
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:15,795
Speaker 7:  Did. And the answer is maybe like, just,

519
00:31:15,825 --> 00:31:19,555
Speaker 7:  just walk it outside and leave it alone is the easiest thing to do. But she

520
00:31:19,555 --> 00:31:23,275
Speaker 7:  got really curious about all these options and she thought that that

521
00:31:23,325 --> 00:31:27,235
Speaker 7:  might bother them because it turns out that these ants communicate via

522
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:30,915
Speaker 7:  sound themselves. They rub little parts of their ant bodies together to talk

523
00:31:30,915 --> 00:31:34,875
Speaker 7:  to each other. And so a whole bunch of vibrations from the speaker

524
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:37,955
Speaker 7:  might interfere with that. And it might piss them off enough that they would

525
00:31:37,955 --> 00:31:41,395
Speaker 7:  just give up and leave. So that's a real possibility too. She got really

526
00:31:41,395 --> 00:31:45,315
Speaker 7:  into the idea of, of further testing of speakers and ants.

527
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:49,155
Speaker 7:  So I, I really think I might have accidentally inspired like a PhD thesis

528
00:31:49,215 --> 00:31:49,595
Speaker 7:  in her,

529
00:31:51,405 --> 00:31:55,275
Speaker 2:  Which genre of music most repels ants is a thing I

530
00:31:55,275 --> 00:31:56,355
Speaker 2:  very much look forward to reading.

531
00:31:58,695 --> 00:32:02,555
Speaker 7:  So that was sort of the rundown of all of the theories.

532
00:32:02,895 --> 00:32:06,555
Speaker 7:  She also just gave me a bunch of an 1 0 1 kind of tips

533
00:32:06,735 --> 00:32:10,115
Speaker 7:  to keep ants from getting into my house in the first place

534
00:32:10,615 --> 00:32:13,795
Speaker 7:  so that I'm not playing whack-a-mole with the colonies once they're in there.

535
00:32:13,825 --> 00:32:14,995
Speaker 7:  Just basic prevention.

536
00:32:15,955 --> 00:32:19,875
Speaker 2:  Probably the best strategy. Yeah. But, okay. Do you know what I keep

537
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:23,555
Speaker 2:  thinking about here? This whole time is as soon as you said the, the, the

538
00:32:23,555 --> 00:32:27,355
Speaker 2:  cubbies and the grill and the, the mesh of the play one. I just keep sitting

539
00:32:27,355 --> 00:32:31,115
Speaker 2:  here being like, there's gonna be some Sonos designer who is sitting there

540
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:34,915
Speaker 2:  listening to this being like, oh my God, do I have to add ant colony

541
00:32:34,915 --> 00:32:38,795
Speaker 2:  habitability to my like design checklist the next time I make

542
00:32:39,005 --> 00:32:42,845
Speaker 2:  a speaker? Like, do you have advice? Did Sam have advice for Sonos on

543
00:32:42,845 --> 00:32:44,925
Speaker 2:  how to solve this? Clearly very real problem.

544
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:49,445
Speaker 7:  Well, I wanted to ask Sonos these questions like, my first stop

545
00:32:49,585 --> 00:32:52,965
Speaker 7:  was gonna be Sonos. 'cause I had to know, I don't know, they, there's a lot

546
00:32:52,965 --> 00:32:56,045
Speaker 7:  of people that keep their speakers outside on patios and things like that.

547
00:32:56,045 --> 00:32:59,845
Speaker 7:  Sure. And after this happened to me, I was like, is there a, a designer at

548
00:33:00,015 --> 00:33:03,725
Speaker 7:  Sonos somewhere that is asking ant infestation

549
00:33:04,005 --> 00:33:07,285
Speaker 7:  questions about the design of these speakers? So I got in touch with them.

550
00:33:07,675 --> 00:33:11,285
Speaker 7:  They were very polite. They said no very firmly two times

551
00:33:12,015 --> 00:33:15,845
Speaker 7:  about participating. I was still very curious. So I

552
00:33:15,845 --> 00:33:18,605
Speaker 7:  emailed a bunch of other speaker companies because I figured a lot of them

553
00:33:18,605 --> 00:33:22,465
Speaker 7:  would be dealing with a similar question, all

554
00:33:22,605 --> 00:33:26,225
Speaker 7:  nos or non responses from them. I, I think I'm just creating

555
00:33:26,355 --> 00:33:30,345
Speaker 7:  small panics on comms teams around the speaker industry. I,

556
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,625
Speaker 2:  I can guarantee you that somewhere there has been a meeting

557
00:33:34,155 --> 00:33:38,145
Speaker 2:  about the ant infestations over the last week. And if that's not impact journalism,

558
00:33:38,425 --> 00:33:39,145
Speaker 2:  I don't know what it's,

559
00:33:39,345 --> 00:33:42,865
Speaker 7:  I just, I want to be, to be an ant on the wall in one of those meetings.

560
00:33:43,305 --> 00:33:45,905
Speaker 7:  I just, I just want to know. But we may never know.

561
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:51,385
Speaker 7:  But like I said, I think I really inspired Sam to look into this more.

562
00:33:52,575 --> 00:33:56,455
Speaker 11:  I would love to do an experiment where I had a bunch of these

563
00:33:56,495 --> 00:34:00,055
Speaker 11:  speakers and I could have them in different environments and,

564
00:34:00,355 --> 00:34:03,815
Speaker 11:  and have some that are plugged in and some aren't to see if it's the, the,

565
00:34:04,435 --> 00:34:07,575
Speaker 11:  the magnetism. So I'd love to do an experiment like this.

566
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:11,455
Speaker 7:  Well, I guess my last question is, any advice for

567
00:34:11,785 --> 00:34:15,695
Speaker 7:  Sonos on making speakers that ants might not be as attracted

568
00:34:15,755 --> 00:34:15,975
Speaker 7:  to?

569
00:34:17,495 --> 00:34:21,455
Speaker 11:  I think that they should switch businesses and start making ant

570
00:34:21,455 --> 00:34:23,015
Speaker 11:  homes. They're really good at that.

571
00:34:24,805 --> 00:34:27,775
Speaker 7:  They're just, they're accidentally really, really good at this. They're

572
00:34:27,975 --> 00:34:28,655
Speaker 11:  Accidentally really good.

573
00:34:29,995 --> 00:34:33,885
Speaker 2:  Look, I'm just saying Sonos tried headphones that didn't really work.

574
00:34:34,035 --> 00:34:38,005
Speaker 2:  They were gonna do set top boxes. They canceled that. It's,

575
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:42,085
Speaker 2:  there might be a straighter line from speakers to ant homes than from

576
00:34:42,085 --> 00:34:45,085
Speaker 2:  speakers to any of that other stuff. They've done all the hard work already.

577
00:34:45,195 --> 00:34:45,685
Speaker 2:  They've

578
00:34:45,685 --> 00:34:46,325
Speaker 7:  Got this and

579
00:34:46,325 --> 00:34:48,245
Speaker 2:  Just start selling it at PetSmart. You're good to go.

580
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:52,365
Speaker 7:  Ask the ants. Dozens of colonies of ants in speakers can't be

581
00:34:52,365 --> 00:34:54,805
Speaker 7:  wrong. They're, they're onto something. I

582
00:34:54,805 --> 00:34:58,645
Speaker 2:  Love it. So you, you, this story for you started in the best possible way,

583
00:34:58,645 --> 00:35:02,125
Speaker 2:  which is just like a, a reporter staring at a mystery trying to figure it

584
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:05,685
Speaker 2:  out. I feel like you, I feel like you a hundred percented this mystery. You

585
00:35:05,685 --> 00:35:06,045
Speaker 2:  solved it.

586
00:35:06,505 --> 00:35:10,205
Speaker 7:  I'm giving myself, yeah. I'm giving myself full points. Yeah. I, I feel good.

587
00:35:10,435 --> 00:35:13,645
Speaker 7:  I've, I don't feel good about my Sonos, but I feel good about everything

588
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:13,725
Speaker 7:  else.

589
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:17,205
Speaker 2:  This was gonna be the last question I asked you. Has it changed how you think

590
00:35:17,205 --> 00:35:20,005
Speaker 2:  about speakers? Like, are you looking at your speaker placement in your house

591
00:35:20,005 --> 00:35:22,405
Speaker 2:  differently now knowing what you know?

592
00:35:22,965 --> 00:35:26,725
Speaker 7:  I am looking at all of my electronics differently. I will say that

593
00:35:26,755 --> 00:35:30,605
Speaker 7:  because I, it did completely invert my thinking around

594
00:35:31,075 --> 00:35:34,845
Speaker 7:  what ants want. And we're still gonna be dealing with these

595
00:35:35,165 --> 00:35:38,805
Speaker 7:  ants seasonally forever. And it's a little

596
00:35:38,835 --> 00:35:42,605
Speaker 7:  ominous. I it's, it's a little bit of a burden of knowledge situation.

597
00:35:43,365 --> 00:35:47,165
Speaker 7:  'cause like you said, I look at my Roku now and

598
00:35:47,265 --> 00:35:50,965
Speaker 7:  all I can think of are the, the tiny little cubbies inside of it. And that's

599
00:35:50,965 --> 00:35:54,885
Speaker 7:  a weird thing to think about when you're looking at your Roku, but here

600
00:35:54,885 --> 00:35:55,605
Speaker 7:  I am. Yeah.

601
00:35:55,605 --> 00:35:58,925
Speaker 2:  If you're, if you're watching or listening to this, my advice is just, just

602
00:35:58,925 --> 00:36:02,805
Speaker 2:  forget all of this. Just, it's, it don't look, ignorance is

603
00:36:02,935 --> 00:36:05,125
Speaker 2:  bliss. Everything's probably fine.

604
00:36:05,545 --> 00:36:09,205
Speaker 7:  You all shouldn't have listened to This is basically the

605
00:36:09,405 --> 00:36:09,605
Speaker 7:  takeaway.

606
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:13,445
Speaker 2:  Yeah. But if you, if you find a bunch of ants now you know what to do.

607
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:17,205
Speaker 2:  And if you don't see them, don't go looking and everything will probably

608
00:36:17,205 --> 00:36:17,565
Speaker 2:  be fine.

609
00:36:18,065 --> 00:36:22,045
Speaker 7:  And join the, the Sonos user forums. That's a, that's a fun time. I'm

610
00:36:22,045 --> 00:36:23,605
Speaker 7:  gonna go post a few things. Yeah.

611
00:36:23,605 --> 00:36:25,045
Speaker 2:  You've got, you've got answers for people.

612
00:36:25,395 --> 00:36:28,765
Speaker 7:  Yeah. I need to like go back, conquer and be the conquering hero. Exactly.

613
00:36:29,475 --> 00:36:31,325
Speaker 7:  It's time that the people knew. Yeah.

614
00:36:32,265 --> 00:36:34,845
Speaker 2:  All right, we gotta take a break and then we're gonna come back and we're

615
00:36:34,845 --> 00:36:38,605
Speaker 2:  gonna talk about podcasts, specifically AI generated podcasts.

616
00:36:38,775 --> 00:36:39,445
Speaker 2:  We'll be right back.

617
00:40:17,905 --> 00:40:21,835
Speaker 14:  funny gag, but also like thinking of stuff I wouldn't want to

618
00:40:21,835 --> 00:40:25,555
Speaker 14:  read and maybe an easier way to understand something.

619
00:40:26,745 --> 00:40:30,355
Speaker 14:  It's such a novelty that I think that's initially where I was going,

620
00:40:30,575 --> 00:40:33,835
Speaker 14:  but yeah, there's actually some interesting use cases for it.

621
00:40:34,225 --> 00:40:37,075
Speaker 2:  Yeah, talk me through that a little bit and I'm, I'm curious how you think

622
00:40:37,075 --> 00:40:40,675
Speaker 2:  about this as somebody who has been making podcasts for a long time. I think

623
00:40:41,555 --> 00:40:45,395
Speaker 2:  'cause the sort of obvious step one is like stereo instructions is

624
00:40:45,515 --> 00:40:49,355
Speaker 2:  a good example, right? I, I have this giant document that is full

625
00:40:49,355 --> 00:40:52,595
Speaker 2:  of technical information that I don't wanna read. Right? And for years

626
00:40:53,255 --> 00:40:57,235
Speaker 2:  the step was just have something read the document to you, right? And

627
00:40:57,235 --> 00:40:59,515
Speaker 2:  there there are just lots of people who learn better that way. Who rather

628
00:40:59,515 --> 00:41:02,915
Speaker 2:  than reading something, you hear something. And that is a, a better learning

629
00:41:02,915 --> 00:41:06,435
Speaker 2:  tool for lots of people. That's very straightforward, right? This is

630
00:41:06,435 --> 00:41:09,715
Speaker 2:  something different. The idea of like, we're, we're gonna,

631
00:41:10,085 --> 00:41:13,555
Speaker 2:  we're gonna not read the thing to you, but we're gonna talk about the thing

632
00:41:14,655 --> 00:41:18,355
Speaker 2:  It is is both sort of in that same line but also just a very

633
00:41:18,355 --> 00:41:20,635
Speaker 2:  different proposition for like how to learn and information.

634
00:41:21,735 --> 00:41:25,435
Speaker 14:  Yes. So I have realized from

635
00:41:25,435 --> 00:41:29,315
Speaker 14:  listening to a bunch of these, how much easier It is to

636
00:41:29,315 --> 00:41:32,995
Speaker 14:  understand something when it's a lot more casual and

637
00:41:33,085 --> 00:41:36,845
Speaker 14:  there's a lot more space between sentences and

638
00:41:37,555 --> 00:41:41,485
Speaker 14:  kind of breathing a little bit between topics. I just

639
00:41:41,485 --> 00:41:45,365
Speaker 14:  wanna play a clip and you can kind of understand what this is sounding like

640
00:41:45,465 --> 00:41:48,005
Speaker 14:  and what it's trying to mimic. That's okay. Yeah.

641
00:41:48,765 --> 00:41:52,575
Speaker 15:  Okay. Get this. Imagine a world where like every

642
00:41:52,605 --> 00:41:56,575
Speaker 15:  website you go to starts charging robots to access it. Oh wow.

643
00:41:56,875 --> 00:42:00,335
Speaker 15:  And, and smart home still can't even make us a decent cup of coffee.

644
00:42:00,845 --> 00:42:01,135
Speaker 15:  Okay.

645
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:07,055
Speaker 14:  So there, there's like space between each phrase and

646
00:42:07,055 --> 00:42:09,975
Speaker 14:  there's the other host is like commenting back

647
00:42:10,915 --> 00:42:14,735
Speaker 14:  and you kind of like take a second to digest

648
00:42:14,735 --> 00:42:18,575
Speaker 14:  what that last sentence was. Versus sometimes when I read a

649
00:42:19,035 --> 00:42:23,015
Speaker 14:  person reading straight text, you kind of forget what the

650
00:42:23,015 --> 00:42:26,935
Speaker 14:  last paragraph was about. Or you weren't paying attention closely. I

651
00:42:27,215 --> 00:42:30,495
Speaker 14:  realized that podcast actually is great for listening

652
00:42:31,155 --> 00:42:34,415
Speaker 14:  in the background because it does move really slowly

653
00:42:35,475 --> 00:42:39,335
Speaker 14:  and helps you still grasp what they're talking about without

654
00:42:39,335 --> 00:42:40,615
Speaker 14:  paying super close attention.

655
00:42:41,155 --> 00:42:44,415
Speaker 2:  So as you listen to something like that, what do you, like, I I always think

656
00:42:44,415 --> 00:42:47,815
Speaker 2:  about the training data with something like this. Like what's, what are these

657
00:42:47,905 --> 00:42:50,135
Speaker 2:  being trained to sound like, do you think?

658
00:42:50,845 --> 00:42:54,175
Speaker 14:  Yeah, so I talked to the director of product Simon

659
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:59,055
Speaker 14:  at a notebook, lm and he was saying that like a lot of this

660
00:42:59,195 --> 00:43:02,975
Speaker 14:  was, they got two people whose voices you're hearing

661
00:43:03,235 --> 00:43:07,055
Speaker 14:  in those notebook LM pieces to

662
00:43:07,055 --> 00:43:10,935
Speaker 14:  just riff in a studio for a long period of time. Oh, interesting. He said

663
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:14,615
Speaker 14:  one of the things they did was just give them a picture and just like

664
00:43:14,935 --> 00:43:18,855
Speaker 14:  describe to each other what's in the picture. So you can hear a lot of

665
00:43:18,905 --> 00:43:22,895
Speaker 14:  stuff within these generative podcasts that we're

666
00:43:23,255 --> 00:43:26,335
Speaker 14:  probably picked up over time in these recordings.

667
00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:30,815
Speaker 2:  That's fascinating. Like how do you mimic a podcast

668
00:43:30,845 --> 00:43:34,655
Speaker 2:  without making a podcast is such a mind bending exercise. That's very fun

669
00:43:34,655 --> 00:43:35,055
Speaker 2:  to think about.

670
00:43:35,365 --> 00:43:39,215
Speaker 14:  Yeah. Yeah. There's moments where I've listened to these audio

671
00:43:39,495 --> 00:43:40,895
Speaker 14:  overviews where they toss to a break

672
00:43:41,635 --> 00:43:45,415
Speaker 16:  As we navigate this crazy ever evolving tech

673
00:43:45,765 --> 00:43:46,895
Speaker 16:  landscape. Couldn't

674
00:43:46,895 --> 00:43:47,815
Speaker 15:  Have said it better myself.

675
00:43:48,185 --> 00:43:50,975
Speaker 16:  Right. So let's take a quick break and then we'll be back to explore some

676
00:43:50,975 --> 00:43:54,855
Speaker 16:  of the other Okay. Intriguing details from the verges review. Sounds good.

677
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:55,695
Speaker 16:  Stay tuned.

678
00:43:58,915 --> 00:44:02,615
Speaker 14:  That's amazing. And it's just, there's no need for that at all. But that

679
00:44:02,615 --> 00:44:05,735
Speaker 14:  was, you know, probably over time that's what this

680
00:44:06,405 --> 00:44:10,015
Speaker 14:  tool was gathering. And also there's probably a lot of other like

681
00:44:10,135 --> 00:44:13,935
Speaker 14:  podcasts that Gemini was, had been trained on, which, you know,

682
00:44:13,935 --> 00:44:16,175
Speaker 14:  obviously this uses Google's Gemini as well.

683
00:44:16,845 --> 00:44:20,655
Speaker 2:  Okay. So take me through your research process a little bit. I I think part

684
00:44:20,655 --> 00:44:22,695
Speaker 2:  of what I'm curious about on this one is like what you even

685
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:28,235
Speaker 2:  decide to upload to test how something like this can be used. What

686
00:44:28,235 --> 00:44:30,555
Speaker 2:  did you, what did you feed into the audio overview system?

687
00:44:31,155 --> 00:44:35,005
Speaker 14:  Yeah, so there's different things you can feed in. Like you can link your

688
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:38,645
Speaker 14:  Google drive right up to it. So any document that's in your Google Drive,

689
00:44:38,665 --> 00:44:42,085
Speaker 14:  It is pretty easy to add any text, audio,

690
00:44:43,225 --> 00:44:47,165
Speaker 14:  any link for like a website and YouTube. So

691
00:44:47,165 --> 00:44:51,085
Speaker 14:  YouTube it will just grab the transcript basically from the

692
00:44:51,085 --> 00:44:54,445
Speaker 14:  video and turn that into a summarization.

693
00:44:55,465 --> 00:44:59,365
Speaker 14:  So what I was trying to do was figure out what you

694
00:44:59,365 --> 00:45:03,125
Speaker 14:  can actually get from adding a mult bunch of

695
00:45:03,125 --> 00:45:06,565
Speaker 14:  different sources together. So like a YouTube video, just putting one of

696
00:45:06,565 --> 00:45:10,245
Speaker 14:  YouTube video I don't think is a great way of, of using this, but it's like

697
00:45:10,325 --> 00:45:14,245
Speaker 14:  a YouTube video and some notes that you took and recording of a meeting

698
00:45:14,425 --> 00:45:14,925
Speaker 14:  and like

699
00:45:16,565 --> 00:45:20,525
Speaker 14:  a PDF of something, like combining all that stuff together and then turning

700
00:45:20,525 --> 00:45:24,445
Speaker 14:  it into an overview or just whatever you wanna do with the notebook. Like

701
00:45:24,875 --> 00:45:28,725
Speaker 14:  take notes and, and ask it questions and all that. That was

702
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:31,845
Speaker 14:  the most useful and I thought that was like a, just a great way

703
00:45:32,585 --> 00:45:34,845
Speaker 14:  of researching and studying for something.

704
00:45:35,475 --> 00:45:38,645
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I think that's, I mean that's kind of the notebook lm pitch in general

705
00:45:39,045 --> 00:45:41,405
Speaker 2:  and I think makes a lot of sense. I am curious though, about the, if you

706
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:45,285
Speaker 2:  just feed it one YouTube link, what do you get back like a, a

707
00:45:45,285 --> 00:45:48,765
Speaker 2:  podcast about a YouTube video? Did they just describe the YouTube video?

708
00:45:49,865 --> 00:45:53,805
Speaker 14:  Yes, so I uploaded the verges iPhone

709
00:45:53,805 --> 00:45:57,605
Speaker 14:  16 Pro review. Okay. And it kind of just went through all the points

710
00:45:58,185 --> 00:46:01,805
Speaker 14:  of the video. So the video was 22 minutes and it

711
00:46:01,995 --> 00:46:05,965
Speaker 14:  made it into a 20 minute podcast. So it's not

712
00:46:05,965 --> 00:46:08,605
Speaker 14:  really something that, like you could have just listened to the YouTube

713
00:46:08,605 --> 00:46:12,445
Speaker 14:  video, you know, so it doesn't really translate that

714
00:46:12,445 --> 00:46:16,365
Speaker 14:  well. But if you upload maybe a bunch of iPhone 16

715
00:46:16,385 --> 00:46:20,285
Speaker 14:  pro reviews and you kind of get a summarization of all these

716
00:46:20,595 --> 00:46:24,085
Speaker 14:  different takes on the phone. Right. Maybe that's more useful.

717
00:46:24,305 --> 00:46:27,765
Speaker 2:  But, so okay. So walk me through, let, let's start on the good side. What,

718
00:46:27,795 --> 00:46:31,405
Speaker 2:  what have you, what did you try that sort of worked for you that you were

719
00:46:31,405 --> 00:46:35,285
Speaker 2:  like, okay, this is a, this is a real useful or interesting

720
00:46:35,415 --> 00:46:37,325
Speaker 2:  thing that is coming out of this whole process?

721
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:41,725
Speaker 14:  Yeah, like I said, instruction manuals, like the, the stereo receiver.

722
00:46:43,045 --> 00:46:46,525
Speaker 14:  I recently came across an ibo, original IBO

723
00:46:46,985 --> 00:46:50,525
Speaker 14:  dog Robot. Yeah. And there's a pretty long instruction manual and I just

724
00:46:51,125 --> 00:46:54,965
Speaker 14:  uploaded that PDF to kind of just, I can listen to on my commute or something

725
00:46:55,505 --> 00:46:56,605
Speaker 14:  to understand how that works.

726
00:46:57,365 --> 00:47:00,925
Speaker 15:  A robot with moods, that's pretty wild. For the early two

727
00:47:01,165 --> 00:47:01,405
Speaker 15:  thousands

728
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:04,965
Speaker 16:  It really was ambitious and you could still interact pad its head sensor

729
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,725
Speaker 16:  show with the ball or maybe colors. It had learned to like,

730
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:12,465
Speaker 14:  That thing worked pretty well. The other one is, I'm trying to

731
00:47:12,465 --> 00:47:15,745
Speaker 14:  get my drone pilot's license. Ooh. So

732
00:47:16,865 --> 00:47:20,665
Speaker 14:  Notebook EL has this tool called Discover where you can

733
00:47:20,775 --> 00:47:24,745
Speaker 14:  just type into it. I want, you know, drone license

734
00:47:25,385 --> 00:47:28,985
Speaker 14:  tutorial and it will pull up a bunch of stuff from the internet that is

735
00:47:29,355 --> 00:47:33,165
Speaker 14:  related to that and you can check off boxes of which source

736
00:47:33,265 --> 00:47:36,685
Speaker 14:  you want to use to put into the notebook. So you can really

737
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:40,205
Speaker 14:  use it as Google and then input those links

738
00:47:40,895 --> 00:47:44,825
Speaker 14:  into your notebook and turn that into a podcast or whatever. So like

739
00:47:45,585 --> 00:47:49,465
Speaker 14:  I wanted to read all these different tutorials about how to get my drone

740
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:53,345
Speaker 14:  pilot's license and I put all that, all those different sources,

741
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:57,425
Speaker 14:  a YouTube video, A-P-D-F-A website and that

742
00:47:57,495 --> 00:48:01,265
Speaker 14:  kind of took all the stuff maybe that they're all, there's some stuff that

743
00:48:01,265 --> 00:48:05,145
Speaker 14:  they're all saying similarly and then some stuff you grab from different

744
00:48:05,145 --> 00:48:08,705
Speaker 14:  sources that might help better than others. Give

745
00:48:08,705 --> 00:48:11,465
Speaker 2:  Me a sense of what that sounds like. I'm, I'm, I'm just trying to figure

746
00:48:11,465 --> 00:48:14,705
Speaker 2:  out, 'cause you, you know, again, you don't want it to read you the instructions

747
00:48:15,085 --> 00:48:18,625
Speaker 2:  for the robot or your stereo or whatever, but I also feel like

748
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:23,665
Speaker 2:  them talking about instructions without giving me the

749
00:48:23,665 --> 00:48:27,105
Speaker 2:  instructions is not quite the right answer either. So like what, what, what

750
00:48:27,105 --> 00:48:29,425
Speaker 2:  does this actually sort of come out sounding like when you feed something

751
00:48:29,425 --> 00:48:29,865
Speaker 2:  like this in

752
00:48:30,095 --> 00:48:33,545
Speaker 14:  Yeah, I'll share what the stereo instructions sound like, which is like

753
00:48:33,545 --> 00:48:34,505
Speaker 14:  pretty useful here.

754
00:48:35,185 --> 00:48:36,705
Speaker 16:  Phono inputs and a ground screw

755
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:39,945
Speaker 15:  For your turntable. Yeah. But only if your turntable doesn't have its own

756
00:48:39,945 --> 00:48:41,625
Speaker 15:  built-in phono preamp. Right.

757
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:44,425
Speaker 16:  If it does use a regular analog input

758
00:48:44,425 --> 00:48:47,705
Speaker 15:  Instead. Correct. And don't forget that MMMC switch we mentioned earlier,

759
00:48:47,795 --> 00:48:49,865
Speaker 15:  needs to match your turntables cartridge type.

760
00:48:51,605 --> 00:48:54,705
Speaker 14:  So like out of context, this is kind of silly and you don't really know

761
00:48:54,705 --> 00:48:57,025
Speaker 14:  what they're talking about, but when you're listening to the whole thing,

762
00:48:57,025 --> 00:49:00,505
Speaker 14:  like they do go into each thing and it's not just they're talking about,

763
00:49:00,845 --> 00:49:04,545
Speaker 14:  so this is a PDF of the stereo manual and like

764
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:08,585
Speaker 14:  gives through a bunch of these different options. Like this is

765
00:49:08,825 --> 00:49:11,785
Speaker 14:  probably actually better if you just wanna know how do I do this on the

766
00:49:11,785 --> 00:49:15,505
Speaker 14:  stereo and you just type to it. Mm. Or you can ask the

767
00:49:15,505 --> 00:49:16,905
Speaker 14:  podcast a question.

768
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:21,585
Speaker 2:  Well, you can ask the podcast a que like, like, it's like a call in

769
00:49:21,585 --> 00:49:25,465
Speaker 2:  show. Like you can, you can actually stop the hosts and tell them

770
00:49:25,525 --> 00:49:26,385
Speaker 2:  you have questions.

771
00:49:26,765 --> 00:49:30,345
Speaker 14:  Yes. Within the notebook LM interface,

772
00:49:30,475 --> 00:49:34,145
Speaker 14:  there is a interactive mode which you can

773
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:38,705
Speaker 14:  basically join the discussion. Like while they're talking you can,

774
00:49:38,945 --> 00:49:40,825
Speaker 14:  they'll be like, oh hey, what's up? So

775
00:49:40,825 --> 00:49:43,665
Speaker 2:  You've just like barged into the studio while they're recording and you're

776
00:49:43,665 --> 00:49:44,745
Speaker 2:  like, I I have something to say.

777
00:49:45,165 --> 00:49:45,745
Speaker 14:  Yes, totally.

778
00:49:46,565 --> 00:49:48,025
Speaker 15:  Is it to move production back?

779
00:49:48,215 --> 00:49:52,185
Speaker 16:  Good point. Apple's preemptive shipment of that volumes. Yep.

780
00:49:52,445 --> 00:49:53,545
Speaker 16:  Go on. Can

781
00:49:53,545 --> 00:49:56,545
Speaker 17:  We skip to the lightning round on ai?

782
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:58,745
Speaker 15:  You know what? Absolutely.

783
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:01,905
Speaker 16:  Sounds like you're eager to dive into the world of artificial intelligence.

784
00:50:02,035 --> 00:50:05,105
Speaker 15:  Let's do it. We were just about to wrap up our initial look at the tariffs

785
00:50:05,105 --> 00:50:05,305
Speaker 15:  anyway.

786
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:07,265
Speaker 16:  Exactly. So without further ado,

787
00:50:07,395 --> 00:50:09,385
Speaker 15:  Let's jump right into that AI lightning round.

788
00:50:09,395 --> 00:50:13,265
Speaker 16:  First up we saw that meta was apparently caught doing some

789
00:50:13,585 --> 00:50:14,065
Speaker 16:  interesting things

790
00:50:14,975 --> 00:50:17,435
Speaker 14:  And then we'll get back to the rest of the show and be like, anyways.

791
00:50:17,455 --> 00:50:20,955
Speaker 2:  Oh, okay. So you can't, you can't sort of right. Turn the whole thing, but

792
00:50:20,955 --> 00:50:23,475
Speaker 2:  you can just, you can kind of pop your head in and be like, oh, but what

793
00:50:23,475 --> 00:50:24,555
Speaker 2:  about, and then they'll get back to work.

794
00:50:24,785 --> 00:50:28,365
Speaker 14:  Okay. Yes. There are like prompts you can kind of do when you generate

795
00:50:28,585 --> 00:50:32,445
Speaker 14:  to be like, focus on this topic or make this topic shorter

796
00:50:32,625 --> 00:50:36,485
Speaker 14:  or, you know, I only want this amount of time to listen to this.

797
00:50:37,185 --> 00:50:40,525
Speaker 2:  Got it. Okay. One thing I know you tried that I'm, I'm very curious about

798
00:50:40,585 --> 00:50:44,045
Speaker 2:  is recipes because I think this is one thing,

799
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:48,325
Speaker 2:  audio recipes to me strike me as potentially a very good idea. Okay.

800
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:51,645
Speaker 2:  You know, in a way that is weird, right? 'cause it's like I use, I use an

801
00:50:51,645 --> 00:50:55,525
Speaker 2:  app that I'm like checking on my phone a hundred thousand times while I'm

802
00:50:55,525 --> 00:50:59,045
Speaker 2:  cooking. And the idea of like just somebody in my ear sort of talking me

803
00:50:59,045 --> 00:51:01,525
Speaker 2:  through the process as I'm cooking seems very cool

804
00:51:02,945 --> 00:51:06,115
Speaker 2:  complicated, right? Like, you can't make a 20 minute podcast that like perfectly

805
00:51:06,115 --> 00:51:08,875
Speaker 2:  matches everything that I'm doing. But it does seem like there's something

806
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:12,715
Speaker 2:  to, like, you could make a fun cooking show recipe by recipe

807
00:51:12,785 --> 00:51:15,395
Speaker 2:  that is actually kind of instructional if this really works. So I feel like

808
00:51:15,835 --> 00:51:18,435
Speaker 2:  I went from thinking this is a totally silly version of it to thinking maybe

809
00:51:18,435 --> 00:51:20,315
Speaker 2:  there's something here. What did you find?

810
00:51:21,465 --> 00:51:25,275
Speaker 14:  Yeah, I I was real, someone on the team suggested

811
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:29,115
Speaker 14:  we upload some recipes to it to see how it would do and

812
00:51:30,235 --> 00:51:34,195
Speaker 14:  I didn't feel like it was something I could follow along with while cooking.

813
00:51:34,975 --> 00:51:38,955
Speaker 14:  And also like in podcast fashion, it took like way

814
00:51:38,955 --> 00:51:42,835
Speaker 14:  too long to get to the point of the conversation. Now

815
00:51:42,835 --> 00:51:46,475
Speaker 14:  lemme play you a clip I got from this honey lemon chicken recipe. Okay.

816
00:51:46,735 --> 00:51:49,795
Speaker 16:  But the thing is we're not just gonna like read out the ingredients and

817
00:51:49,795 --> 00:51:53,435
Speaker 16:  call it a day. Right. We're gonna try to figure out why this

818
00:51:53,435 --> 00:51:57,035
Speaker 16:  particular approach and it's got like a 4.7 star rating, by the way.

819
00:51:57,215 --> 00:52:00,715
Speaker 16:  Why? Yeah. Pretty solid, right? So we're gonna figure out why this approach

820
00:52:00,715 --> 00:52:04,515
Speaker 16:  is so popular and what we can learn from it, even if we're not, you know,

821
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:06,875
Speaker 16:  planning on cooking anytime soon. Absolutely.

822
00:52:08,275 --> 00:52:10,755
Speaker 2:  I love so much that they're like, no, no, no, we're not gonna tell you about

823
00:52:10,755 --> 00:52:13,355
Speaker 2:  the recipe. You uploaded a recipe, we're not gonna tell you about the recipe,

824
00:52:13,365 --> 00:52:14,315
Speaker 2:  we're gonna talk about other stuff.

825
00:52:14,525 --> 00:52:17,915
Speaker 14:  Right. So eventually it does get to like what you do, what the ingredients

826
00:52:17,915 --> 00:52:21,875
Speaker 14:  are, but it was like, let's speak to the power of why

827
00:52:21,875 --> 00:52:25,435
Speaker 14:  this honey lemon chicken is so popular. And It is like, I don't really wanna

828
00:52:25,435 --> 00:52:29,235
Speaker 14:  know that. I just wanna get to the points. There may be a,

829
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:32,755
Speaker 14:  a world in the future where it's like, all right, now you're going to do

830
00:52:32,755 --> 00:52:36,195
Speaker 14:  this. Let me know when you're done and I'll get to the next thing. This

831
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:36,555
Speaker 14:  does sort

832
00:52:36,795 --> 00:52:40,235
Speaker 2:  Of neatly map to everything wrong with recipe sites on the internet. Right.

833
00:52:40,235 --> 00:52:42,835
Speaker 2:  That's the thing where you, you open a recipe webpage and you're like, I

834
00:52:42,835 --> 00:52:45,355
Speaker 2:  would just like to see the recipe. And they're like, first, how about 2000

835
00:52:45,355 --> 00:52:49,155
Speaker 2:  words about my life and all of my thoughts about honey chicken and

836
00:52:49,155 --> 00:52:52,995
Speaker 2:  everything that's happening to me right now. And then way down the page after

837
00:52:52,995 --> 00:52:56,755
Speaker 2:  some ads and videos, we'll get to the recipe. It's like they're, they're

838
00:52:56,755 --> 00:52:58,115
Speaker 2:  just making the podcast version of

839
00:52:58,115 --> 00:53:01,755
Speaker 14:  That. Oh my gosh. And it, when I mentioned about how they toss to a break,

840
00:53:01,985 --> 00:53:05,275
Speaker 14:  like there's a world where maybe like they wanna start monetizing these

841
00:53:05,295 --> 00:53:08,555
Speaker 14:  and when you Sure. You generate a honey lemon chicken recipe, there's like,

842
00:53:08,555 --> 00:53:11,435
Speaker 14:  all right, let's get to a break before we get into the ingredients and it

843
00:53:11,435 --> 00:53:14,115
Speaker 14:  just plays an ad or something like that.

844
00:53:14,555 --> 00:53:18,475
Speaker 2:  Yeah. That's, that's, that's super interesting. Did you

845
00:53:18,475 --> 00:53:21,875
Speaker 2:  test this with podcasts? Like you, you, I know you did YouTube videos,

846
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:25,350
Speaker 2:  but like, can you put a podcast in here and it'll make a podcast about the

847
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:25,550
Speaker 2:  podcast?

848
00:53:26,265 --> 00:53:29,925
Speaker 14:  Yes. Someone suggested putting like a four hour Joe Rogan podcast

849
00:53:30,155 --> 00:53:33,045
Speaker 14:  into it Sure. To generate, you know, a 20 minute summary.

850
00:53:34,155 --> 00:53:36,805
Speaker 2:  It's basically like a, it's like a meta podcast. Yeah. Like I'm gonna make

851
00:53:36,805 --> 00:53:37,885
Speaker 2:  a podcast about your podcast.

852
00:53:38,705 --> 00:53:42,605
Speaker 14:  Yes. We did try a scenario where we uploaded

853
00:53:43,025 --> 00:53:46,205
Speaker 14:  pre-production documents from our own podcasts

854
00:53:46,945 --> 00:53:50,445
Speaker 14:  and made them into a podcast and compare to how we

855
00:53:50,915 --> 00:53:51,365
Speaker 14:  made them.

856
00:53:52,065 --> 00:53:52,965
Speaker 2:  Oh, interesting. Okay.

857
00:53:53,065 --> 00:53:56,965
Speaker 14:  So decoder with Neli Patel, they have like

858
00:53:57,045 --> 00:54:00,645
Speaker 14:  a nice pre-production document with questions, topics, guest

859
00:54:00,955 --> 00:54:04,805
Speaker 14:  bios, and a lot of relevant links and all that stuff. So I

860
00:54:05,005 --> 00:54:08,525
Speaker 14:  uploaded that to NotebookLM and it

861
00:54:08,525 --> 00:54:12,205
Speaker 14:  generated a podcast of that discussion.

862
00:54:12,965 --> 00:54:16,805
Speaker 14:  I made one with, from an episode about EVs that Neli and

863
00:54:17,275 --> 00:54:19,965
Speaker 14:  Andy Hawkins from The Verge talked about. But it

864
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:23,205
Speaker 2:  Didn't have, it didn't, you didn't upload the actual finished podcast? Just

865
00:54:23,205 --> 00:54:24,565
Speaker 2:  the, the pre-production documents?

866
00:54:24,675 --> 00:54:27,965
Speaker 14:  Yeah. Yeah. Oh, thats so fun. I wanted to see how it worked compared to

867
00:54:27,985 --> 00:54:31,965
Speaker 14:  how we ended up making the show. Obviously you don't get enough

868
00:54:32,305 --> 00:54:36,245
Speaker 14:  of it because you don't have Neli, you don't have Andy. But it like did

869
00:54:36,285 --> 00:54:36,565
Speaker 14:  a pretty,

870
00:54:38,225 --> 00:54:42,125
Speaker 14:  it did a pretty impressive job of like taking all these points and like

871
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:45,045
Speaker 14:  going through them all. But it was more just like

872
00:54:46,095 --> 00:54:49,995
Speaker 14:  how you would do it if you just wanted to get the information for a research

873
00:54:50,045 --> 00:54:53,595
Speaker 14:  paper or something like that. Okay. It wasn't like going to break down

874
00:54:54,085 --> 00:54:58,035
Speaker 14:  these topics and what they mean and like, what are these questions that

875
00:54:58,255 --> 00:55:02,155
Speaker 14:  unfold because of these news things. Much like

876
00:55:02,155 --> 00:55:05,755
Speaker 14:  The Vergecast, we uploaded a rundown from The

877
00:55:05,915 --> 00:55:09,875
Speaker 14:  Vergecast, which is just a, a lot of links to stuff on The Verge. Oh

878
00:55:09,875 --> 00:55:13,555
Speaker 2:  Yeah. That's really interesting because that's like the, the decoder rundown

879
00:55:13,555 --> 00:55:17,075
Speaker 2:  you described is full of like information and clues and

880
00:55:17,395 --> 00:55:21,315
Speaker 2:  hints about what's interesting and has some real structure. The Friday

881
00:55:21,595 --> 00:55:24,675
Speaker 2:  Vergecast rundown is just, I mean, it's just like a hundred links in a Google

882
00:55:24,695 --> 00:55:27,075
Speaker 2:  doc. Yeah. And that's, that's the entirety of the prep doc.

883
00:55:27,815 --> 00:55:31,795
Speaker 14:  Yes. So when you listen to that audio overview of a

884
00:55:31,955 --> 00:55:35,395
Speaker 14:  Vergecast rundown, you quickly learn that it cannot open

885
00:55:35,395 --> 00:55:38,435
Speaker 14:  hyperlinks and that It is just reading

886
00:55:39,535 --> 00:55:43,475
Speaker 14:  the headlines and making some kind of generic

887
00:55:43,485 --> 00:55:45,475
Speaker 14:  takes about what that means.

888
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:49,115
Speaker 2:  So it's, it's experiencing the world like the way people who just scroll

889
00:55:49,115 --> 00:55:50,835
Speaker 2:  really fast through like their Facebook feed do.

890
00:55:51,305 --> 00:55:55,075
Speaker 14:  Yeah. Yeah. So here's a clip from it about the framework

891
00:55:55,215 --> 00:55:55,635
Speaker 14:  laptop,

892
00:55:56,135 --> 00:55:58,275
Speaker 15:  And then there's framework, the laptop company,

893
00:55:58,495 --> 00:56:00,155
Speaker 16:  Ah, the modular laptop folks,

894
00:56:00,155 --> 00:56:03,515
Speaker 15:  That's them. They actually had to stop selling some of their more affordable

895
00:56:03,515 --> 00:56:05,755
Speaker 15:  laptops, experienced order delays because of

896
00:56:05,755 --> 00:56:06,315
Speaker 16:  The tariffs.

897
00:56:06,425 --> 00:56:10,355
Speaker 15:  Yeah. And even briefly raised and then lowered their prices because of the

898
00:56:10,355 --> 00:56:13,315
Speaker 15:  tariffs. It just sounds incredibly volatile for them.

899
00:56:13,705 --> 00:56:17,515
Speaker 16:  That really underscores the immediate disruption, the instability that

900
00:56:17,515 --> 00:56:20,715
Speaker 16:  tariffs can inject into supply chains and pricing strategies.

901
00:56:20,725 --> 00:56:22,195
Speaker 15:  Total chaos seems like the

902
00:56:22,195 --> 00:56:25,525
Speaker 16:  Fact that they had to make such rapid adjustments reflects the realtime

903
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:27,245
Speaker 16:  pressures businesses are under.

904
00:56:28,625 --> 00:56:32,205
Speaker 14:  So you can tell, like all it's doing is just seeing that

905
00:56:32,445 --> 00:56:36,405
Speaker 14:  headline in adding it to context of the world, which it

906
00:56:36,405 --> 00:56:40,245
Speaker 14:  does have from Gemini a little bit. There was another one where I asked

907
00:56:40,245 --> 00:56:44,045
Speaker 14:  about a Sony Bravia TV from a headline. I actually asked it

908
00:56:44,045 --> 00:56:47,565
Speaker 14:  like, what is the model of that tv? And it didn't know because it wasn't

909
00:56:47,565 --> 00:56:48,045
Speaker 14:  in the headline.

910
00:56:48,075 --> 00:56:51,525
Speaker 2:  Okay. Yeah. That's an interesting one. Like I, I can even hear they're mentioning

911
00:56:51,525 --> 00:56:55,405
Speaker 2:  in there, you know, that they, they raised and then lowered the, the, the

912
00:56:55,405 --> 00:56:58,485
Speaker 2:  prices very quickly and literally the headline we had in that document is

913
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:02,205
Speaker 2:  framework raised prices and then unraised them an hour later because of Trump.

914
00:57:02,275 --> 00:57:06,125
Speaker 2:  Like, yep. It's just, it, it said all those words in a slightly different

915
00:57:06,125 --> 00:57:10,005
Speaker 2:  order again. But again, like that, that was all

916
00:57:10,005 --> 00:57:13,725
Speaker 2:  right. I don't know that that was like good or thoughtful, but it was, it

917
00:57:13,725 --> 00:57:17,245
Speaker 2:  was right. You sent me a big chunk of one of these, and my,

918
00:57:17,585 --> 00:57:21,365
Speaker 2:  my memory of listening to it was that there are a bunch of things that got

919
00:57:22,195 --> 00:57:24,005
Speaker 2:  sort of flatly wrong,

920
00:57:26,145 --> 00:57:28,525
Speaker 2:  all for sort of understandable reasons, which I thought was interesting.

921
00:57:28,525 --> 00:57:32,405
Speaker 2:  Like at at least there is absolutely we should say potential for

922
00:57:32,405 --> 00:57:34,885
Speaker 2:  these things to just completely make things up out of absolutely nowhere.

923
00:57:35,825 --> 00:57:38,485
Speaker 2:  And I'm curious if you had that experience, but at least in the one that

924
00:57:38,605 --> 00:57:42,525
Speaker 2:  I heard, there were a bunch of things that it just kind of whiffed

925
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:46,205
Speaker 2:  on making connections between, or made connections that are wrong and

926
00:57:46,515 --> 00:57:50,365
Speaker 2:  like misread a headline or something. But I, in every single case, I, I could

927
00:57:50,365 --> 00:57:53,685
Speaker 2:  figure out where it was getting the wrong information from,

928
00:57:54,405 --> 00:57:56,365
Speaker 2:  which I thought was really interesting. And it's like, okay, this thing is

929
00:57:56,365 --> 00:58:00,165
Speaker 2:  making a lot of mistakes, but I can trace the mistakes most

930
00:58:00,165 --> 00:58:03,605
Speaker 2:  people wouldn't. Right. Which is like, why this is dangerous. I like, I had,

931
00:58:03,685 --> 00:58:06,605
Speaker 2:  I had also made this podcast that it was trying to make, so like I knew the

932
00:58:06,605 --> 00:58:07,405
Speaker 2:  stuff it was talking about,

933
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:12,085
Speaker 2:  but so there, but it does just very confidently get things wrong

934
00:58:13,265 --> 00:58:16,835
Speaker 2:  without telling you anything about sort of where it's coming from.

935
00:58:17,815 --> 00:58:21,555
Speaker 14:  Yes. So I uploaded some notes from a podcast I was working

936
00:58:21,695 --> 00:58:25,555
Speaker 14:  on and it's had some of the people I talked to in the

937
00:58:25,715 --> 00:58:29,595
Speaker 14:  document, but not any quotes or anything. And when I put it in notebook

938
00:58:29,675 --> 00:58:33,315
Speaker 14:  l the audio overviews just kind of made up quotes that the people

939
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:33,675
Speaker 14:  said

940
00:58:33,985 --> 00:58:36,555
Speaker 2:  Like, attributed to these people. Yes. Oh my gosh.

941
00:58:37,295 --> 00:58:40,515
Speaker 14:  So that is just made up like that's really bad. They just made that up.

942
00:58:40,705 --> 00:58:44,515
Speaker 14:  Yeah, that's really bad. Yeah. Luckily it was only about

943
00:58:44,515 --> 00:58:47,075
Speaker 14:  salad dressing, but like you can imagine this could be serious.

944
00:58:47,545 --> 00:58:51,425
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I mean, and this is like, that's the thing with all of this stuff,

945
00:58:51,505 --> 00:58:54,345
Speaker 2:  right? And I, and so many of these tools are like, it's, it's the, it's the

946
00:58:54,345 --> 00:58:58,305
Speaker 2:  glue on pizza in Google, right? Some of this stuff you can

947
00:58:58,305 --> 00:59:02,145
Speaker 2:  see where it comes from. Some of It is just being purely hallucinated by

948
00:59:02,145 --> 00:59:05,105
Speaker 2:  these tools that have been taught to have answers even when no answers are

949
00:59:05,105 --> 00:59:07,425
Speaker 2:  available. Yeah. Like this is the thing a lot of these have been through,

950
00:59:07,425 --> 00:59:11,225
Speaker 2:  right? Where they, they will go and they will, they are asked for

951
00:59:11,225 --> 00:59:14,865
Speaker 2:  information that they don't have and so they will fabricate it and that is

952
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:18,385
Speaker 2:  the wrong outcome. But with something like this where like it, it would be

953
00:59:18,465 --> 00:59:22,245
Speaker 2:  a bad version of an audio overview for it to just

954
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:25,005
Speaker 2:  10 times in 20 minutes be like, we don't really know anything about that,

955
00:59:25,105 --> 00:59:29,005
Speaker 2:  so let's move on. And so that, that tension feels

956
00:59:29,105 --> 00:59:32,805
Speaker 2:  so, so real to me in a way that even Notebook LM in general

957
00:59:32,985 --> 00:59:36,845
Speaker 2:  has done a good job of citing its sources pretty aggressively

958
00:59:36,865 --> 00:59:39,885
Speaker 2:  and it'll point you to the thing it's talking about in all of the different

959
00:59:40,085 --> 00:59:44,045
Speaker 2:  documents. And it It is pretty thoughtful in that way. You

960
00:59:44,045 --> 00:59:46,885
Speaker 2:  can't do that with audio. You just can't, like you, you, if you are constantly

961
00:59:46,885 --> 00:59:49,725
Speaker 2:  like referencing the name of your source for every single thing that you

962
00:59:49,725 --> 00:59:52,125
Speaker 2:  say that's bad podcast and it's a problem.

963
00:59:52,675 --> 00:59:56,645
Speaker 14:  Yeah. That and also in the interactive mode you can try to

964
00:59:56,645 --> 01:00:00,525
Speaker 14:  correct the podcast host and maybe it will learn that and put it

965
01:00:00,525 --> 01:00:03,965
Speaker 14:  in some bank or something, but no, it doesn't work like that. The iPhone

966
01:00:03,965 --> 01:00:07,805
Speaker 14:  16 review it kept referring to Neli as Nelly and

967
01:00:08,035 --> 01:00:10,165
Speaker 14:  calling him her and she,

968
01:00:10,555 --> 01:00:12,845
Speaker 16:  Okay, so Nelly Patel from The Verge reviewed this, so

969
01:00:12,915 --> 01:00:16,205
Speaker 15:  Exactly. And she brings a really interesting perspective, doesn't she? Oh

970
01:00:16,205 --> 01:00:16,405
Speaker 15:  yeah,

971
01:00:17,065 --> 01:00:20,685
Speaker 14:  The host is Neely Patel and his pronouns are he him.

972
01:00:21,465 --> 01:00:23,085
Speaker 15:  Oh, that's an interesting question. You

973
01:00:23,085 --> 01:00:24,365
Speaker 16:  Know, it's easy to make assumptions

974
01:00:24,615 --> 01:00:26,485
Speaker 15:  Based on what we've seen and heard, but

975
01:00:26,805 --> 01:00:29,125
Speaker 16:  Actually Nelly Patel uses she her pronouns.

976
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,845
Speaker 15:  Thanks for pointing that out. It's good to be accurate.

977
01:00:31,205 --> 01:00:32,565
Speaker 16:  Absolutely. Thanks for keeping us on her toes.

978
01:00:32,985 --> 01:00:34,965
Speaker 15:  So getting back to Neely's review,

979
01:00:38,185 --> 01:00:39,205
Speaker 14:  She wrote the review, so

980
01:00:39,475 --> 01:00:43,245
Speaker 2:  Poor Neli Neli, I have, I've known Neli a long time and, and that, that man

981
01:00:43,245 --> 01:00:45,725
Speaker 2:  has had his name mispronounced every way you possibly could,

982
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:51,125
Speaker 2:  but Nelly, she her is, is a tough beat for, for

983
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:54,765
Speaker 2:  Neli Patel. So what, what does that make you think as a consumer

984
01:00:54,905 --> 01:00:58,605
Speaker 2:  of this stuff? I mean, I think you've now done the research to know that

985
01:00:58,605 --> 01:01:02,485
Speaker 2:  like there is, there is something that works about this kind of thing for

986
01:01:02,485 --> 01:01:06,295
Speaker 2:  certain kinds of information, but is there that thing in your brain that's

987
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:08,935
Speaker 2:  like, okay, this is giving me stereo instructions even or like information

988
01:01:08,935 --> 01:01:12,815
Speaker 2:  about a recipe and I don't know if I should completely trust it and by the

989
01:01:12,895 --> 01:01:15,495
Speaker 2:  time I have to pull out my phone to fact check this podcast, what am I doing

990
01:01:15,495 --> 01:01:15,735
Speaker 2:  here?

991
01:01:15,845 --> 01:01:19,655
Speaker 14:  Yeah. Yeah. I think it's like low stake stuff. I,

992
01:01:19,775 --> 01:01:23,455
Speaker 14:  I, I think like really if you want to get the most out of notebook lm I

993
01:01:23,455 --> 01:01:26,455
Speaker 14:  think it's more useful to just be typing to it and asking you questions

994
01:01:26,455 --> 01:01:30,255
Speaker 14:  about the sources. The audio overviews is interesting. Like maybe

995
01:01:30,255 --> 01:01:33,175
Speaker 14:  it's just some people will just like, that's the way they can learn and

996
01:01:33,175 --> 01:01:36,895
Speaker 14:  that's the way they wanna do it and I know they're gonna have more

997
01:01:37,035 --> 01:01:40,815
Speaker 14:  voices. If you get tired of those voices, there's gonna be more personas

998
01:01:40,815 --> 01:01:44,695
Speaker 14:  they call it. So I think the future's gonna get better. It's gonna

999
01:01:44,695 --> 01:01:48,575
Speaker 14:  be hard to see like how much It is actually improving as far as

1000
01:01:49,415 --> 01:01:50,135
Speaker 14:  accuracy goes.

1001
01:01:50,325 --> 01:01:54,215
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. I think the, the way I have always thought

1002
01:01:54,215 --> 01:01:57,295
Speaker 2:  about AI is like I, I treat it like I treat

1003
01:01:58,045 --> 01:02:01,495
Speaker 2:  Wikipedia in a certain sense and I, I actually, I would argue Wikipedia is

1004
01:02:01,495 --> 01:02:05,375
Speaker 2:  in many ways a more trustworthy source, but in the same sense that like I

1005
01:02:05,375 --> 01:02:09,335
Speaker 2:  wouldn't, I wouldn't take anything I read on Wikipedia and then

1006
01:02:09,335 --> 01:02:13,095
Speaker 2:  like submit it as professional work or

1007
01:02:13,625 --> 01:02:17,535
Speaker 2:  swear to it under oath or like bet my life on anything that I read

1008
01:02:17,535 --> 01:02:21,205
Speaker 2:  on Wikipedia. Do you know what I mean? But it's like in terms of going from,

1009
01:02:21,445 --> 01:02:25,365
Speaker 2:  I don't know, something about this to, I now kind of know something about

1010
01:02:25,365 --> 01:02:28,925
Speaker 2:  this, it tends to work and, and as long as the

1011
01:02:28,925 --> 01:02:32,285
Speaker 2:  requirement is not that I be an expert with a hundred percent correct knowledge,

1012
01:02:33,155 --> 01:02:36,085
Speaker 2:  fine. Right. But I'm like, I was, I was looking it up this morning,

1013
01:02:37,185 --> 01:02:40,725
Speaker 2:  we were watching Mulan because my son is home from daycare this week and

1014
01:02:40,725 --> 01:02:44,525
Speaker 2:  we have watched Mulan 250 times and it was like, who is that that's

1015
01:02:44,525 --> 01:02:47,925
Speaker 2:  singing this song? That voice sounds kind of familiar. That is information

1016
01:02:48,795 --> 01:02:52,725
Speaker 2:  that both AI and Wikipedia are well equipped to have and find and give

1017
01:02:52,725 --> 01:02:56,605
Speaker 2:  to me. And also if it's wrong, the world will not end. And so

1018
01:02:56,605 --> 01:03:00,525
Speaker 2:  for the stuff at the bottom of that pyramid, I'm like, go nuts. Listen to

1019
01:03:00,525 --> 01:03:04,445
Speaker 2:  the audio podcast about the Mulan singer and and

1020
01:03:04,495 --> 01:03:08,365
Speaker 2:  enjoy the next 20 minutes of your life. Anything above that, I think like

1021
01:03:08,595 --> 01:03:12,005
Speaker 2:  real skepticism becomes very important. Yeah.

1022
01:03:12,425 --> 01:03:15,965
Speaker 2:  But it's so hard because these are like the, the thing that has amazed me,

1023
01:03:15,965 --> 01:03:19,285
Speaker 2:  and I'm curious if this has been your experience too, is how quickly I came

1024
01:03:19,345 --> 01:03:22,845
Speaker 2:  to listen to these hosts as if they were people.

1025
01:03:23,235 --> 01:03:26,485
Speaker 2:  Like I've made a lot of podcasts and so I'm like editing their podcast in

1026
01:03:26,485 --> 01:03:29,245
Speaker 2:  my mind as I'm going, which makes me realize I'm producing this thing like

1027
01:03:29,245 --> 01:03:32,765
Speaker 2:  I'm producing people. And that was sort of alarming.

1028
01:03:34,235 --> 01:03:38,005
Speaker 14:  Yeah. After a while I do get sick of the host, to be honest. Yeah.

1029
01:03:38,365 --> 01:03:41,045
Speaker 14:  I just like, I don't, I'm sick of these people. I don't wanna listen to

1030
01:03:41,125 --> 01:03:44,365
Speaker 14:  'em anymore. They make too many puns. There's too many metaphors.

1031
01:03:44,635 --> 01:03:47,285
Speaker 2:  They do. What have you learned about like podcast tropes? 'cause I feel like

1032
01:03:47,285 --> 01:03:50,965
Speaker 2:  this would teach you every, all the bad habits that every podcaster has

1033
01:03:51,705 --> 01:03:54,805
Speaker 2:  are like boiled into this. What have you learned about being a podcast producer?

1034
01:03:55,275 --> 01:03:59,085
Speaker 14:  Yeah, like I said, like the ums actually might do something,

1035
01:03:59,495 --> 01:04:02,885
Speaker 14:  might help, but yeah, no, the tropes of like, let's unpack this.

1036
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:07,245
Speaker 14:  It really speaks to the power of that kind of stuff is like,

1037
01:04:07,245 --> 01:04:10,965
Speaker 14:  yeah. Oh my gosh, I can't, I'm I'm never using those

1038
01:04:10,965 --> 01:04:12,005
Speaker 14:  phrases ever again. They

1039
01:04:12,005 --> 01:04:15,325
Speaker 2:  Start like every episode by being like, let's do a deep dive. And I just

1040
01:04:15,345 --> 01:04:18,365
Speaker 2:  now deep dive is like on the list of corporate jargon that I'm just like,

1041
01:04:18,405 --> 01:04:20,605
Speaker 2:  I can't hear it without wanting to leap out of a window anymore.

1042
01:04:20,995 --> 01:04:24,285
Speaker 14:  Yeah. Simon took Amin a from Notebook El

1043
01:04:24,395 --> 01:04:28,045
Speaker 14:  mentioned that he heard some other podcasts saying

1044
01:04:28,055 --> 01:04:31,685
Speaker 14:  stuff that he noticed in Notebook LM first. Like,

1045
01:04:31,905 --> 01:04:35,725
Speaker 14:  oh, that's the million dollar question. I don't know. I don't know.

1046
01:04:35,845 --> 01:04:38,605
Speaker 14:  I think that's just, that's just a podcast he phrased.

1047
01:04:38,605 --> 01:04:40,605
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I don't think he gets credit for million dollar questions. I don't

1048
01:04:40,605 --> 01:04:42,245
Speaker 2:  think so. I think, I think that one's been around,

1049
01:04:42,825 --> 01:04:46,725
Speaker 14:  But like you can see like now you're already like they're sounding

1050
01:04:46,725 --> 01:04:47,525
Speaker 14:  the same. Right?

1051
01:04:47,555 --> 01:04:51,525
Speaker 2:  Totally. Yeah. And I'm, I'm going to be deep in my head about not sounding

1052
01:04:51,525 --> 01:04:55,405
Speaker 2:  like notebook lm it's like there was that thing going around not that long

1053
01:04:55,405 --> 01:04:59,285
Speaker 2:  ago where everybody was talking about the, the M dash and

1054
01:04:59,285 --> 01:05:03,045
Speaker 2:  chat G PT is like the Yeah, the the how, you know, it's chat GT is when there's

1055
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:06,645
Speaker 2:  M dashes. I'm like, no, I love M dashes. I write with M dashes all the time.

1056
01:05:06,925 --> 01:05:08,405
Speaker 2:  I write with fewer M dashes now.

1057
01:05:08,605 --> 01:05:09,885
Speaker 14:  Yeah, yeah. Right. Like

1058
01:05:09,885 --> 01:05:12,525
Speaker 2:  Consciously, I'm like, I don't wanna sound like chey pt, I have to not use

1059
01:05:12,685 --> 01:05:13,685
Speaker 2:  M dashes. Totally.

1060
01:05:14,145 --> 01:05:17,500
Speaker 14:  The more we see of all this artificial stuff online is like, like the more

1061
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:21,405
Speaker 14:  you appreciate stuff humans make and the more like, maybe we are

1062
01:05:21,405 --> 01:05:25,365
Speaker 14:  making better stuff now because we see like how boring

1063
01:05:25,545 --> 01:05:29,125
Speaker 14:  or uncreative AI can be. And like maybe that's like

1064
01:05:30,385 --> 01:05:33,845
Speaker 14:  we always talk about competition on The Vergecast. Like what if humans are

1065
01:05:33,845 --> 01:05:37,085
Speaker 14:  now competing with AI and now humans are just gonna be better because of

1066
01:05:37,085 --> 01:05:37,885
Speaker 14:  what AI is.

1067
01:05:38,595 --> 01:05:42,245
Speaker 2:  I'll, I'll take it. That's, that's an okay outcome. I think the, the

1068
01:05:42,435 --> 01:05:46,335
Speaker 2:  last question I keep thinking about with this is I, I

1069
01:05:46,335 --> 01:05:50,255
Speaker 2:  can see it as a tool for learning things, right?

1070
01:05:50,255 --> 01:05:53,975
Speaker 2:  Like in, in a sort of deliberate, I need to acquire this information

1071
01:05:54,245 --> 01:05:57,655
Speaker 2:  kind of way. And I think the, the feedback you we've gotten so far in the

1072
01:05:57,655 --> 01:06:00,095
Speaker 2:  video suggests that there are people who are using it that way that are like,

1073
01:06:00,095 --> 01:06:03,775
Speaker 2:  this is just a way that I absorb information better. And that's great. But

1074
01:06:03,775 --> 01:06:07,295
Speaker 2:  another thing, podcasts are for a lot of people It is just pure entertainment.

1075
01:06:07,295 --> 01:06:11,215
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It's just, it's like a fun and interesting and and valuable

1076
01:06:11,215 --> 01:06:15,155
Speaker 2:  way to spend your time hanging out with people. Do you see any

1077
01:06:15,155 --> 01:06:18,995
Speaker 2:  of this ever getting there? Like can these hosts ever be so fun to listen

1078
01:06:18,995 --> 01:06:20,715
Speaker 2:  to that you don't even really care what they're talking about?

1079
01:06:21,595 --> 01:06:25,075
Speaker 14:  I think the only thing is the interactive mode that really

1080
01:06:25,485 --> 01:06:28,835
Speaker 14:  takes it another level. 'cause you can't call into The Vergecast whenever

1081
01:06:28,835 --> 01:06:32,475
Speaker 14:  you're listening to it and ask the hosts a question. Like,

1082
01:06:32,695 --> 01:06:36,515
Speaker 14:  you can do that with this. You're not getting, like,

1083
01:06:37,155 --> 01:06:39,875
Speaker 14:  I don't think people are gonna have a parasocial relationship with these

1084
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:42,915
Speaker 14:  two AI hosts. So you, you don't get a lot of that.

1085
01:06:43,415 --> 01:06:45,275
Speaker 2:  The, the history of AI suggest we the

1086
01:06:45,275 --> 01:06:49,195
Speaker 14:  Point we we don't know. Yeah. But there is

1087
01:06:49,195 --> 01:06:53,075
Speaker 14:  something to that where like I know that a Notebook album is developing

1088
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:57,035
Speaker 14:  an app or they're gonna release an app and that is like, if I'm on

1089
01:06:57,035 --> 01:06:59,995
Speaker 14:  my phone and I have the app and I'm just listening to the podcast saying

1090
01:06:59,995 --> 01:07:03,875
Speaker 14:  it just be like, oh hey, can you take that again? Or what

1091
01:07:03,875 --> 01:07:07,475
Speaker 14:  is that? Can you explain more about this thing that

1092
01:07:07,575 --> 01:07:09,515
Speaker 14:  that's actually like pretty useful.

1093
01:07:10,065 --> 01:07:13,635
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it makes sense. And I think I like, I wanna see the version of this

1094
01:07:13,635 --> 01:07:17,615
Speaker 2:  that is just like two dudes shooting the shit

1095
01:07:17,615 --> 01:07:21,135
Speaker 2:  about sports, which is like a lot of the podcasts I listen to just to sort

1096
01:07:21,135 --> 01:07:25,075
Speaker 2:  of zone out while I'm walking the dog or whatever. And in a

1097
01:07:25,075 --> 01:07:28,995
Speaker 2:  way, that kind of stuff is sort of replicable. We we've, we

1098
01:07:28,995 --> 01:07:32,795
Speaker 2:  have a lot of data of it in, in a certain way. It's like, it

1099
01:07:32,795 --> 01:07:35,875
Speaker 2:  doesn't require all that much like true information. It's just kind of a

1100
01:07:35,875 --> 01:07:39,755
Speaker 2:  hang. Yeah. And people are are

1101
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:43,075
Speaker 2:  talking to the voice modes of these assistants that way. Like it, it both

1102
01:07:43,075 --> 01:07:46,875
Speaker 2:  seems totally implausible to me that it might just be fun to listen

1103
01:07:46,895 --> 01:07:50,795
Speaker 2:  to this for an hour, but also seems like maybe we're closer to that than

1104
01:07:50,795 --> 01:07:52,075
Speaker 2:  I'm giving it credit for. I don't

1105
01:07:52,075 --> 01:07:55,795
Speaker 14:  Know, maybe. Yeah. I was given an example that someone who

1106
01:07:55,795 --> 01:07:59,075
Speaker 14:  really likes one of the Real Housewives shows

1107
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:03,315
Speaker 14:  did not have anyone to talk to about it and just wanted to listen to some

1108
01:08:03,575 --> 01:08:06,635
Speaker 14:  two people talking about it on the podcast. And like,

1109
01:08:07,475 --> 01:08:10,915
Speaker 14:  I think there's a lot of examples of like sports and stuff that there's

1110
01:08:10,915 --> 01:08:14,395
Speaker 14:  like just thousands of podcasts that do this, but maybe something like

1111
01:08:14,685 --> 01:08:18,645
Speaker 14:  super niche, like maybe it's like high school football

1112
01:08:18,675 --> 01:08:21,925
Speaker 14:  team of your hometown or something like that and you're just feeding all

1113
01:08:21,925 --> 01:08:25,045
Speaker 14:  that information to it and like no one's gonna be doing a podcast about

1114
01:08:25,045 --> 01:08:26,725
Speaker 14:  that. That could be useful.

1115
01:08:27,155 --> 01:08:31,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I like that idea. Super niche podcasts is, is a

1116
01:08:31,045 --> 01:08:32,685
Speaker 2:  thing I would like to see more of in the world in general.

1117
01:08:33,265 --> 01:08:37,085
Speaker 14:  Yes. Yes. Yeah. Particularly I would prefer it more from people,

1118
01:08:37,305 --> 01:08:38,365
Speaker 14:  but Yeah. Yeah.

1119
01:08:38,435 --> 01:08:41,885
Speaker 2:  I'll, I'll take what I can get. All right Andrew, this is very fun. Thank

1120
01:08:41,885 --> 01:08:44,165
Speaker 2:  you for doing this with us. All right, we gotta take a break and then we're

1121
01:08:44,165 --> 01:08:47,165
Speaker 2:  gonna do a question from the first cast. Hot night Andrew. Thanks buddy.

1122
01:08:47,375 --> 01:08:47,725
Speaker 2:  Thank

1123
01:08:47,725 --> 01:08:47,805
Speaker 14:  You.

1124
01:11:35,165 --> 01:11:39,085
Speaker 22:  nicely with Apple HomeKit. I see all these influencers on socials with the

1125
01:11:39,245 --> 01:11:43,005
Speaker 22:  magazine lighting setups and I get a little jealous. Thanks in advance.

1126
01:11:43,235 --> 01:11:46,965
Speaker 22:  Keep up the great work. PS David, I went and bought a pair of

1127
01:11:47,285 --> 01:11:51,045
Speaker 22:  $19 US BBC apple ear pods just to record this voicemail

1128
01:11:51,105 --> 01:11:54,925
Speaker 22:  on your recommendation. Your efforts have not been in vain. Take care.

1129
01:11:56,015 --> 01:11:59,805
Speaker 2:  First of all, Sean gets it. Great job Sean. Second of all, gen two is here.

1130
01:11:59,825 --> 01:12:00,245
Speaker 2:  Hi Jen.

1131
01:12:00,495 --> 01:12:02,765
Speaker 23:  Hello. Hello. Happy to be here. The

1132
01:12:02,765 --> 01:12:05,965
Speaker 2:  First time I heard this question I was like, oh, this is simple and there

1133
01:12:05,965 --> 01:12:08,645
Speaker 2:  are lots of options and we can go through a bunch of them. And then listening

1134
01:12:08,645 --> 01:12:12,485
Speaker 2:  to that again, I'm actually like, this is kind of a complex thing to

1135
01:12:12,665 --> 01:12:13,445
Speaker 2:  try and do.

1136
01:12:14,615 --> 01:12:18,245
Speaker 23:  Sadly it's, you know what, it made it tricky

1137
01:12:19,265 --> 01:12:22,895
Speaker 23:  color changing. Soon as you said that is when it got complicated.

1138
01:12:23,405 --> 01:12:26,095
Speaker 2:  Okay, interesting. So if you didn't want color changing,

1139
01:12:26,355 --> 01:12:27,655
Speaker 23:  It would be so much easier. Yes.

1140
01:12:27,735 --> 01:12:28,775
Speaker 2:  Really? Oh, okay. Yes.

1141
01:12:29,175 --> 01:12:29,415
Speaker 23:  Well,

1142
01:12:29,475 --> 01:12:32,495
Speaker 2:  So all right, well, so let's, let's start there. 'cause I think the sort

1143
01:12:32,495 --> 01:12:35,335
Speaker 2:  of bones of what he's describing I think is actually a question a lot of

1144
01:12:35,335 --> 01:12:37,975
Speaker 2:  people go through. Yeah. And then the color changing is a wrinkle, but, so

1145
01:12:37,975 --> 01:12:41,495
Speaker 2:  let's, let's start without the wrinkle. Okay. What would you, where, where's

1146
01:12:41,495 --> 01:12:42,255
Speaker 2:  a good place to start for that?

1147
01:12:42,795 --> 01:12:46,255
Speaker 23:  So, well I, whenever anyone asks me a question about

1148
01:12:46,815 --> 01:12:50,295
Speaker 23:  existing smart home setups and how and expanding, I would always start with

1149
01:12:50,295 --> 01:12:53,975
Speaker 23:  what they have and build on that. So he said, I have Hugh and Casser

1150
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:58,695
Speaker 23:  and Lutron Casser is, I assume what he's referring to. And those are smart

1151
01:12:59,015 --> 01:13:02,935
Speaker 23:  switches. Number one rule about smart lighting is that

1152
01:13:02,935 --> 01:13:06,495
Speaker 23:  smart light switches do not work with smart bulbs.

1153
01:13:07,395 --> 01:13:11,215
Speaker 23:  And this is complicated. And I do have an

1154
01:13:11,215 --> 01:13:15,055
Speaker 23:  article explaining this, which we can link to, but there are some exceptions

1155
01:13:15,055 --> 01:13:18,575
Speaker 23:  which I'll get into. But you, if you ha, you cannot put a Phillips hu light

1156
01:13:18,575 --> 01:13:22,535
Speaker 23:  bulb in a socket controlled by a casser smart switch. If it's just

1157
01:13:22,635 --> 01:13:26,295
Speaker 23:  on and off, you might be okay. But if you have Phillips U bulbs, you want

1158
01:13:26,295 --> 01:13:30,175
Speaker 23:  dimming and dimming, they go crazy. I've done it and I've

1159
01:13:30,425 --> 01:13:34,415
Speaker 23:  burnt light switches and I've blown bulbs doing it. So

1160
01:13:34,415 --> 01:13:38,255
Speaker 23:  it's not good. And this is the problem. So if he didn't want color

1161
01:13:38,455 --> 01:13:42,335
Speaker 23:  lighting, I would just say get some decent quality dumb, I

1162
01:13:42,455 --> 01:13:46,295
Speaker 23:  hate that word, but LED light bulbs or light

1163
01:13:46,295 --> 01:13:49,735
Speaker 23:  fixtures and cas smart switches because they're rock solid,

1164
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:53,935
Speaker 23:  reliable. They work with apple home. You can use fixtures

1165
01:13:53,955 --> 01:13:57,135
Speaker 23:  and as opposed to just bulbs. So you can have something nice in your guest

1166
01:13:57,135 --> 01:14:00,855
Speaker 23:  room slash but that room has got a lot of

1167
01:14:00,855 --> 01:14:04,375
Speaker 23:  purposes. It does and that also makes it slightly complicated. Yeah.

1168
01:14:04,835 --> 01:14:07,855
Speaker 23:  So yeah, a nice fixture that you can control with light switches,

1169
01:14:08,505 --> 01:14:12,445
Speaker 23:  caers great, love them. But when you throw in color

1170
01:14:12,685 --> 01:14:16,165
Speaker 23:  changing and you already have Phillips Hu, then I would definitely consider

1171
01:14:16,745 --> 01:14:20,725
Speaker 23:  Philip Hu. Then you need to deal with a different switch

1172
01:14:21,085 --> 01:14:24,765
Speaker 23:  scenario because you cannot use casser. You mentioned wanting a

1173
01:14:24,925 --> 01:14:28,525
Speaker 23:  physical switch because you can't don't want to have to use an app.

1174
01:14:29,145 --> 01:14:32,605
Speaker 23:  I'm guessing that means that in-laws probably aren't gonna use voice control

1175
01:14:32,605 --> 01:14:34,405
Speaker 23:  either, because that would be another option.

1176
01:14:34,885 --> 01:14:38,285
Speaker 2:  I will say for this particular setup, like you're describing a room with

1177
01:14:38,285 --> 01:14:41,645
Speaker 2:  lots of different people and lots of different uses. I think requiring

1178
01:14:42,085 --> 01:14:45,485
Speaker 2:  physical switches feels like the right call. Like this is just not everyone

1179
01:14:45,485 --> 01:14:48,405
Speaker 2:  who comes into your house should not have to download an app to use your

1180
01:14:48,405 --> 01:14:52,325
Speaker 23:  Lights. You should always have physical switches. I agree. And, and

1181
01:14:52,325 --> 01:14:55,445
Speaker 23:  you're wiring it from the grand up. See this is the other, this is the fun

1182
01:14:55,445 --> 01:14:58,965
Speaker 23:  part for me. If I was building a brand new house right now, I would not

1183
01:14:58,965 --> 01:15:02,845
Speaker 23:  hardwire switches into my house. Interesting. Because all smart bulbs can

1184
01:15:02,845 --> 01:15:06,685
Speaker 23:  be controlled by wireless switches, which give you placement

1185
01:15:06,805 --> 01:15:09,645
Speaker 23:  option. So you can move them around if you just don't like where your light

1186
01:15:09,645 --> 01:15:12,405
Speaker 23:  switch is. But that could make resale tricky

1187
01:15:14,045 --> 01:15:17,165
Speaker 23:  'cause it's not expected. But for Phillips hu,

1188
01:15:17,825 --> 01:15:21,805
Speaker 23:  that's an option. So they do have their own wireless switches that you can

1189
01:15:21,865 --> 01:15:25,805
Speaker 23:  use. Their smart button wall-mounted dimmer switches and then

1190
01:15:25,805 --> 01:15:29,765
Speaker 23:  their hue, tap dial switch would all control every light in the home in

1191
01:15:29,765 --> 01:15:33,605
Speaker 23:  the room. Plus hue has a great selection of light fixtures

1192
01:15:33,605 --> 01:15:37,405
Speaker 23:  if you don't wanna just use bulbs, because you know, especially in

1193
01:15:37,405 --> 01:15:40,965
Speaker 23:  more modern homes, just having light bulbs is the way people are going there

1194
01:15:40,965 --> 01:15:44,885
Speaker 23:  looking for nice light fixtures that add to the aesthetic of the home.

1195
01:15:45,825 --> 01:15:48,645
Speaker 23:  And a lot of those are gonna be LE Ds. So they're permanently sealed so

1196
01:15:48,645 --> 01:15:52,485
Speaker 23:  you're not replacing bulbs. So that's, that's one option and you

1197
01:15:52,485 --> 01:15:56,285
Speaker 23:  wouldn't actually need wires for that. But in terms of code

1198
01:15:57,145 --> 01:16:00,125
Speaker 23:  or resale value, you know, you'd probably wanna wire 'em up the switches

1199
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:04,085
Speaker 23:  and then you could just put the Phillips hue option whether you use

1200
01:16:04,085 --> 01:16:07,725
Speaker 23:  the dimmer switch, the smart button or the tap switch over the wall plate.

1201
01:16:07,725 --> 01:16:10,845
Speaker 23:  So in future you could go back to wire if you wanted. Sure.

1202
01:16:11,205 --> 01:16:14,845
Speaker 2:  I feel like I'm even seeing more and more people just have the

1203
01:16:15,165 --> 01:16:19,045
Speaker 2:  existing switches for existing lights and then just stick the, the

1204
01:16:19,185 --> 01:16:22,005
Speaker 2:  hue switch or whatever just on the wall right next to it next as if it's

1205
01:16:22,005 --> 01:16:25,685
Speaker 2:  another switch. It's not like a perfect strategy but it, that seems simple

1206
01:16:25,685 --> 01:16:26,045
Speaker 2:  enough.

1207
01:16:26,305 --> 01:16:30,165
Speaker 23:  It is, It is. And that that would be the most straightforward. You

1208
01:16:30,165 --> 01:16:33,245
Speaker 23:  stay in one ecosystem with Hugh or Caer,

1209
01:16:34,145 --> 01:16:36,405
Speaker 23:  but there is good news and this is something that's changed.

1210
01:16:37,065 --> 01:16:39,205
Speaker 2:  Jen, if you're about to say matter, I'm gonna hang up on you.

1211
01:16:39,585 --> 01:16:39,805
Speaker 23:  No,

1212
01:16:43,375 --> 01:16:47,205
Speaker 23:  there is the matter does play a part in this answer. Okay. But no,

1213
01:16:47,315 --> 01:16:50,845
Speaker 23:  this is that there are now smart switches with something called

1214
01:16:51,015 --> 01:16:54,965
Speaker 23:  smart bulb mode. Hmm. So you can now buy smart switches

1215
01:16:55,035 --> 01:16:59,005
Speaker 23:  that work with smart bulbs. And basically the problem here is

1216
01:16:59,225 --> 01:17:03,005
Speaker 23:  if you wire up any switch to a smart bulb, there is gonna be a point when

1217
01:17:03,005 --> 01:17:05,845
Speaker 23:  you flip the switch off and it's designed to cut the power to the bulb and

1218
01:17:05,845 --> 01:17:09,605
Speaker 23:  then your smart bulb doesn't work. Also there can be power

1219
01:17:10,145 --> 01:17:13,885
Speaker 23:  levels with dimming. 'cause the whole point of dimming, what dimming

1220
01:17:14,085 --> 01:17:17,685
Speaker 23:  actually does is just reduce the power to the bulb and that's where they,

1221
01:17:17,785 --> 01:17:21,645
Speaker 23:  you get into issues with casser because it starts flickering. That's what

1222
01:17:21,925 --> 01:17:24,525
Speaker 23:  happened to my bulbs. So your smart bulbs will start flickering and that's

1223
01:17:24,525 --> 01:17:27,605
Speaker 23:  not fun. Got anyway. So these new bulbs

1224
01:17:28,635 --> 01:17:32,605
Speaker 23:  sort of trick the energy flow and they always keep

1225
01:17:32,605 --> 01:17:36,485
Speaker 23:  the bulb with a a minimum amount of power. And there's a couple

1226
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:40,205
Speaker 23:  people that make these. One is a company called Inve. They're really lovely

1227
01:17:40,295 --> 01:17:43,725
Speaker 23:  smart switches. This is the other thing you want probably want ones that

1228
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:47,685
Speaker 23:  look nice because there are some cheaper ones out there. But if

1229
01:17:47,685 --> 01:17:51,205
Speaker 23:  you want, you know, if you're building a new room, you're gonna want some

1230
01:17:51,205 --> 01:17:54,005
Speaker 23:  nice looking switches. They have them in different colors, they're really

1231
01:17:54,005 --> 01:17:57,765
Speaker 23:  nice, they work with Matter, they have thread over matter

1232
01:17:58,145 --> 01:18:01,485
Speaker 23:  and hopefully you're gonna have good wifi out in your garage. But this could

1233
01:18:01,485 --> 01:18:05,285
Speaker 23:  help if that's gonna be a problem. But there's $70 each, which is

1234
01:18:05,285 --> 01:18:09,045
Speaker 23:  also about how much the Casser switches are. So right switch smart switches

1235
01:18:09,065 --> 01:18:13,005
Speaker 23:  are expensive. That is the big downside. And the other downside within inve

1236
01:18:13,025 --> 01:18:16,845
Speaker 23:  is that they always seem to be out of stock. So they

1237
01:18:16,865 --> 01:18:20,365
Speaker 23:  may not work in this scenario, but you, this way you could have Phillips

1238
01:18:20,565 --> 01:18:24,485
Speaker 23:  U bulbs and physical switches in your garage. So I think

1239
01:18:24,485 --> 01:18:28,365
Speaker 23:  that could work pretty well for you if you can get, if you can get these

1240
01:18:28,365 --> 01:18:32,325
Speaker 23:  ones in stock. Yeah, I think they're sold primarily through in Valley's

1241
01:18:32,325 --> 01:18:36,245
Speaker 23:  website. Full disclosure, I have not tested any of Inovelli smart switches

1242
01:18:36,245 --> 01:18:39,565
Speaker 23:  myself, but I've always heard good things about them. They have a whole

1243
01:18:39,565 --> 01:18:43,405
Speaker 23:  line. They also have ZigBee ones Z-Wave ones. So if you

1244
01:18:43,405 --> 01:18:46,365
Speaker 23:  have ZigBee or Z-Wave in your smart home, you could go with that option

1245
01:18:46,365 --> 01:18:50,325
Speaker 23:  too. There are a couple other choices though, but this

1246
01:18:50,325 --> 01:18:53,325
Speaker 23:  would lock you into an ecosystem which,

1247
01:18:54,145 --> 01:18:57,485
Speaker 23:  you know, you've already got two ecosystems in your home. You've got Casita

1248
01:18:57,485 --> 01:19:00,965
Speaker 23:  and Hue, although they all work with Apple Home, but a Cara

1249
01:19:01,785 --> 01:19:05,725
Speaker 23:  has now really expanded its smart lighting options and they

1250
01:19:05,725 --> 01:19:09,605
Speaker 23:  have a smart switch with smart bulb mode, but they only work with

1251
01:19:09,685 --> 01:19:13,565
Speaker 23:  a Cara product. So you'd have to buy a Cara Light bulbs, a Cara

1252
01:19:13,575 --> 01:19:17,445
Speaker 23:  light strips and they also have the A car ceiling light and they're

1253
01:19:17,445 --> 01:19:21,045
Speaker 23:  much less expensive. We're talking like 20 or $30 instead of 70.

1254
01:19:22,025 --> 01:19:25,925
Speaker 23:  So that, that would be one other option. There are obviously lots of great

1255
01:19:25,925 --> 01:19:29,405
Speaker 23:  options in smart lighting. You mentioned YouTubers with wonderful backgrounds.

1256
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:33,485
Speaker 23:  I'm gonna guess a lot of those are gonna be using Nano Leaf. I was gonna

1257
01:19:33,505 --> 01:19:37,005
Speaker 23:  say, which would be an option here too. Works with Apple Home,

1258
01:19:37,175 --> 01:19:40,165
Speaker 23:  works with Matter. They just came out with a new

1259
01:19:41,125 --> 01:19:45,045
Speaker 23:  wireless switch, their wireless sense switch, which I've been testing recently

1260
01:19:45,065 --> 01:19:48,565
Speaker 23:  and it's, it's really interesting. It has a lot of great features

1261
01:19:49,025 --> 01:19:52,845
Speaker 23:  but I I, I hesitate for you to throw another brand in

1262
01:19:52,845 --> 01:19:56,645
Speaker 23:  the mix right now. I think Hugh is probably your best bet if you're gonna

1263
01:19:56,645 --> 01:19:59,765
Speaker 23:  go with wireless switches. But that is an option if you were thinking like,

1264
01:19:59,885 --> 01:20:03,685
Speaker 23:  I wanna move away from Hue, you could could look at Nano Leaf Life X is

1265
01:20:03,685 --> 01:20:07,445
Speaker 23:  another one. They don't have any good switch solutions though. It's,

1266
01:20:07,635 --> 01:20:11,565
Speaker 23:  it's so odd that it's taken a really long time for us to get a good

1267
01:20:11,885 --> 01:20:15,565
Speaker 23:  solution to the smart bulb, smart switch conundrum because

1268
01:20:15,665 --> 01:20:18,805
Speaker 23:  whilst the white lighting with smart lighting is great, especially when

1269
01:20:18,805 --> 01:20:22,005
Speaker 23:  you have tunable white lighting, so you can sort of change the tone throughout

1270
01:20:22,005 --> 01:20:25,925
Speaker 23:  the day. But It is fun to be able to throw in colored lighting,

1271
01:20:25,925 --> 01:20:29,685
Speaker 23:  especially in a room that's gonna maybe used for fun teenage activities

1272
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:33,085
Speaker 23:  or maybe doing some spin classes and you want some

1273
01:20:33,925 --> 01:20:37,845
Speaker 23:  pulsing lights to go along with the music. If you, if it's gonna be, I think

1274
01:20:37,845 --> 01:20:40,925
Speaker 23:  you said it was gonna be a workout room, Sean, but yeah, I'd like to see

1275
01:20:40,925 --> 01:20:44,765
Speaker 23:  more solutions here and we're beginning to, but they all tend to

1276
01:20:44,765 --> 01:20:48,445
Speaker 23:  stay within the same ecosystem and this is where Matter might

1277
01:20:48,475 --> 01:20:48,765
Speaker 23:  help.

1278
01:20:49,635 --> 01:20:52,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah, in theory It is, It is actually, this is a perfect

1279
01:20:53,505 --> 01:20:55,005
Speaker 2:  reason for matter to exist.

1280
01:20:55,325 --> 01:20:59,205
Speaker 23:  Something I have been looking for since Matter came like how can I

1281
01:20:59,205 --> 01:21:03,165
Speaker 23:  make, 'cause I have a Frankenstein selection of smart lights and switches

1282
01:21:03,165 --> 01:21:06,325
Speaker 23:  in my home and I cannot, it's been a struggle to get them all to work together

1283
01:21:07,585 --> 01:21:11,325
Speaker 23:  and that's where I, you know, sort of, to me the ultimate matter

1284
01:21:11,765 --> 01:21:15,525
Speaker 23:  actually has worked Moment will be when every light in my home

1285
01:21:15,705 --> 01:21:19,485
Speaker 23:  can all work in one app. Not there yet. Dream

1286
01:21:19,985 --> 01:21:21,805
Speaker 2:  How many apps is it right now, would you say?

1287
01:21:21,885 --> 01:21:25,005
Speaker 23:  I, I, I, I, I dunno that I could actually count

1288
01:21:25,485 --> 01:21:26,605
Speaker 2:  That's, that's too many.

1289
01:21:26,605 --> 01:21:30,485
Speaker 23:  Yeah, there's a lot of good solutions but for this case I would say

1290
01:21:31,685 --> 01:21:35,445
Speaker 23:  probably Skip Caer goes to Philip Hu and use the Philip

1291
01:21:35,625 --> 01:21:39,205
Speaker 23:  Hu smart button or more mounted dimmer switches or these

1292
01:21:39,785 --> 01:21:43,725
Speaker 23:  Vly smart Bulb mode switches. I would say go with ER

1293
01:21:44,105 --> 01:21:47,805
Speaker 23:  if they supported matter, but they don't, Lutron

1294
01:21:47,905 --> 01:21:51,485
Speaker 23:  has not gotten the matter bandwagon. They're great rock solid as I said.

1295
01:21:51,505 --> 01:21:55,325
Speaker 23:  But again, you know, for future proofing, I think I would,

1296
01:21:55,485 --> 01:21:58,685
Speaker 23:  I would definitely stick with products that work with Matter.

1297
01:21:59,265 --> 01:22:00,845
Speaker 23:  That's, I'm definitely at that stage now.

1298
01:22:01,315 --> 01:22:05,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah, I think that's the right call and I like that's like the, the

1299
01:22:05,145 --> 01:22:08,525
Speaker 2:  Hue solution is a little less elegant

1300
01:22:08,985 --> 01:22:12,325
Speaker 2:  but probably a lot simpler to actually put in your house and the NFL one

1301
01:22:12,325 --> 01:22:16,125
Speaker 2:  is like gonna be more work to get right. But then

1302
01:22:16,225 --> 01:22:20,125
Speaker 2:  is the thing that gives you kind of the most seamless version of

1303
01:22:20,125 --> 01:22:22,805
Speaker 2:  the experience you're looking for. So I think definitely, I think one of

1304
01:22:22,805 --> 01:22:23,965
Speaker 2:  those two things is probably Right. That

1305
01:22:23,965 --> 01:22:27,525
Speaker 23:  Makes sense. Yeah. And there are the run less wire switches too, if you've

1306
01:22:27,525 --> 01:22:31,365
Speaker 23:  come across those which are like kinetic switches that work

1307
01:22:31,365 --> 01:22:35,125
Speaker 23:  with Hu Bobs. Again, I've not used them myself, but I feel like if you're

1308
01:22:35,405 --> 01:22:39,045
Speaker 23:  gonna go with a wireless solution, go with Hughes Wireless solution because

1309
01:22:39,065 --> 01:22:42,965
Speaker 23:  the Hughes system just really works well together. Yeah. But if

1310
01:22:42,965 --> 01:22:46,885
Speaker 23:  you do want Wired, I think in Ave could be a good option. You just may

1311
01:22:46,885 --> 01:22:50,645
Speaker 23:  have to wait. I'm not sure when they're gonna be back in stock, but

1312
01:22:50,715 --> 01:22:54,525
Speaker 23:  yeah. And if you do get this all set up, I would love to hear

1313
01:22:54,605 --> 01:22:57,805
Speaker 23:  a report and what it looks like and send us some pictures and tell us how

1314
01:22:57,805 --> 01:22:58,205
Speaker 23:  it all went.
