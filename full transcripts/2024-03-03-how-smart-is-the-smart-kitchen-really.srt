Description: The Verge’s Jennifer Pattison Tuohy has as smart a kitchen as any reasonable person possibly could; she has smart appliances, a smart sink, a smart fridge, and more voice assistants than anyone could ever talk to. And for a few days, she tried to let her kitchen do the work: telling her what to cook, getting everything set up just right, and even taking some of the cooking and cleaning load off her shoulders. Jen kept a diary during her adventures, and then joined The Vergecast to tell the tale. The fun, frustrating, exciting, harrowing tale.

00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:41,285
Speaker 3:  Welcome To. The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Android

3
00:00:41,285 --> 00:00:45,125
Speaker 3:  Fridges. I'm your friend David Pierce and I'm here with Jen Pattison

4
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:46,325
Speaker 3:  Tui. Hi Jen Welcome back.

5
00:00:46,705 --> 00:00:48,605
Speaker 4:  Hi David. Great to be back as always.

6
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:52,645
Speaker 3:  This is part two of our Smart Home series, If. you missed last week's episode.

7
00:00:52,705 --> 00:00:56,085
Speaker 3:  Go back and listen to it. We got deep in our feelings about the Smart Kitchen.

8
00:00:56,425 --> 00:01:00,365
Speaker 3:  It was very fun For this episode, Jen, we gave you a very specific,

9
00:01:00,705 --> 00:01:04,125
Speaker 3:  and I suspect very arduous task, which is to basically

10
00:01:04,795 --> 00:01:08,485
Speaker 3:  explore the state of the art of the smart kitchen. You have kind of

11
00:01:08,685 --> 00:01:12,605
Speaker 3:  acquired as smart a kitchen as probably any reasonable person could be expected

12
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:16,525
Speaker 3:  to have at this point in time. And we asked you to

13
00:01:16,525 --> 00:01:20,125
Speaker 3:  basically demonstrate over the course of a few days exactly how

14
00:01:20,215 --> 00:01:24,005
Speaker 3:  smart you could make your kitchen and your life. And we asked you to keep

15
00:01:24,245 --> 00:01:28,165
Speaker 3:  a voice memos diary of the whole experience and we're gonna play a

16
00:01:28,165 --> 00:01:30,325
Speaker 3:  few clips of what we have here, right? Yeah,

17
00:01:30,355 --> 00:01:33,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So basically the idea was, okay, I'm going to

18
00:01:33,945 --> 00:01:37,765
Speaker 4:  really put my Smart Kitchen to the test. As I mentioned, I had bought a few

19
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:41,125
Speaker 4:  new appliances in the last couple years, but even myself as a Smart Home

20
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:45,005
Speaker 4:  Review, I haven't really dove into all of the features that they have. you

21
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:48,085
Speaker 4:  know, I haven't had to test them for work. So, I think it's a very common

22
00:01:48,085 --> 00:01:51,645
Speaker 4:  issue in the Smart kitchen. People get smart devices and actually never

23
00:01:52,035 --> 00:01:55,925
Speaker 4:  connect them or do any of the features that they have. So I was like,

24
00:01:55,985 --> 00:01:59,565
Speaker 4:  I'm really gonna like dive into the, the features of the stuff that I bought

25
00:01:59,565 --> 00:02:03,005
Speaker 4:  for myself. And then I'm also gonna explore how

26
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:06,605
Speaker 4:  those devices and other smart kitchen devices that I've tested

27
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:10,285
Speaker 4:  work together. Because this was sort of something we talked about a lot in

28
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:13,685
Speaker 4:  the last episode that a big problem with the smart home in general is that

29
00:02:13,685 --> 00:02:17,605
Speaker 4:  interoperability, you sort of feel siloed. A lot of devices feel very sort

30
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:21,285
Speaker 4:  of siloed. So that was kind of the overall theme, like put my smart kitchen

31
00:02:21,305 --> 00:02:25,285
Speaker 4:  to the test. But I also wanted to use, based on chatting with Ben

32
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:29,285
Speaker 4:  and Nick and the founder of Fresco and the Whisk app, now

33
00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:33,125
Speaker 4:  Samsung Food really puts it to the test how technology can

34
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:37,005
Speaker 4:  help us cook in terms of using recipes, guided cooking,

35
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:41,205
Speaker 4:  make, make me a better chef in my kitchen because that sort of seemed

36
00:02:41,205 --> 00:02:44,325
Speaker 4:  to be a theme that has emerged in the Smart kitchen. That it's not so much

37
00:02:44,325 --> 00:02:48,205
Speaker 4:  that the kitchen's gonna cook for you, but the kitchen is gonna help you

38
00:02:48,275 --> 00:02:51,685
Speaker 4:  cook better. So that was, that was kind of one of the things I was really

39
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:55,445
Speaker 4:  excited to try. Tried a few dishes I've never tried before. I

40
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:59,365
Speaker 4:  also wanted to see if the Smart Kitchen could save me time because convenience

41
00:02:59,705 --> 00:03:03,605
Speaker 4:  is sort of one of the big selling points of the smart home. Yep. That was

42
00:03:03,605 --> 00:03:07,565
Speaker 4:  sort of the framing for my sort of five to seven days of, of,

43
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:11,445
Speaker 4:  of using my smart kitchen to, to its fullest extent.

44
00:03:12,345 --> 00:03:16,285
Speaker 3:  So one of the things I've been thinking a lot about since we talked to Nick

45
00:03:16,285 --> 00:03:20,085
Speaker 3:  and Ben for last week's episode is this idea of

46
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:24,325
Speaker 3:  cooking and kind of the role of the Smart kitchen being kind of

47
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:27,965
Speaker 3:  on a longer timeline than we think about, right? Like we talk about the smart

48
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:31,725
Speaker 3:  kitchen as I'm standing in the kitchen making something,

49
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:35,365
Speaker 3:  I have a recipe in my hand and I need to go from recipe and raw ingredients

50
00:03:35,585 --> 00:03:39,485
Speaker 3:  to made thing. But actually the way they were thinking about it and the

51
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:43,445
Speaker 3:  way I think I'm curious to hear how it affected you is the timeline of that

52
00:03:43,445 --> 00:03:47,205
Speaker 3:  is much longer, right? It's like it's, it's grocery shopping, which is actually

53
00:03:47,205 --> 00:03:50,205
Speaker 3:  about meal planning, which is actually about recipe discovery, which is actually

54
00:03:50,205 --> 00:03:53,765
Speaker 3:  about health questions. And then on the other side it's, it's prep, it's

55
00:03:53,765 --> 00:03:57,645
Speaker 3:  cleanup, it's dish washing, it's all this different stuff. So actually there

56
00:03:57,645 --> 00:04:01,085
Speaker 3:  is this gigantic spectrum of like time and activities.

57
00:04:01,745 --> 00:04:05,645
Speaker 3:  Did your smart kitchen hit that whole spectrum? Like how, how broad a

58
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,045
Speaker 3:  look at this did you feel like you could take going in?

59
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:11,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah, no, I definitely started sort of from the beginning with the meal planning,

60
00:04:11,605 --> 00:04:15,565
Speaker 4:  which is something I have tried to do for many months, many

61
00:04:15,565 --> 00:04:19,245
Speaker 4:  years. Same. you know, I have two kids. I have a husband who

62
00:04:19,435 --> 00:04:23,365
Speaker 4:  insists on a full hot meal. We, we, I don't get away with cereal

63
00:04:23,425 --> 00:04:27,405
Speaker 4:  for dinner. That was sort of very quat of the experiment for me was

64
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:31,245
Speaker 4:  can this be better than it was before because I have never successfully managed

65
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,485
Speaker 4:  to meal plan. It's time consuming and

66
00:04:35,085 --> 00:04:39,045
Speaker 4:  tiresome and can be kind of expensive upfront. you know, in the end

67
00:04:39,065 --> 00:04:42,725
Speaker 4:  it probably saves you money because you don't end up buying takeout. But

68
00:04:42,835 --> 00:04:46,485
Speaker 4:  it's a chore for sure. And I really wanted to see Samsung

69
00:04:46,635 --> 00:04:50,045
Speaker 4:  food in particular. That's sort of something that this app touts that it

70
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:54,125
Speaker 4:  can help you with putting it all into one place because there are lots of

71
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:57,445
Speaker 4:  great tools out there for meal planning, digital tools, paper tools.

72
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:01,605
Speaker 4:  I've seen very fancy notebooks you can buy for $50 in stationary stores

73
00:05:01,615 --> 00:05:03,045
Speaker 4:  where you plan out your meal.

74
00:05:03,365 --> 00:05:05,965
Speaker 3:  I mean, I'm definitely gonna end up buying one of those and then never using

75
00:05:05,965 --> 00:05:07,365
Speaker 3:  it. That feels like me. Yeah.

76
00:05:07,905 --> 00:05:11,445
Speaker 4:  You know when you spend more time planning than you actually doing. Oh yeah.

77
00:05:11,705 --> 00:05:15,685
Speaker 4:  And I've just not, I, I've never found a good solution for me So I as

78
00:05:15,725 --> 00:05:19,685
Speaker 4:  a smart home reviewer. I was hoping that this would be the solution. I just,

79
00:05:19,705 --> 00:05:23,245
Speaker 4:  you know, spoiler alert it worked but it still took a lot of time.

80
00:05:24,285 --> 00:05:28,045
Speaker 3:  I, I would assume by the way that the beginning of this process would

81
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:31,925
Speaker 3:  involve the first smart gadget in our array here, which would be the fridge.

82
00:05:31,985 --> 00:05:35,885
Speaker 3:  That's the idea behind the smart fridge, right? Is that it can help you

83
00:05:36,355 --> 00:05:39,205
Speaker 3:  with some knowledge of what's in the fridge and what you buy and what you

84
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:42,885
Speaker 3:  eat and what's going bad and whatever actually help you make that

85
00:05:42,995 --> 00:05:46,285
Speaker 3:  meal plan. Right? That's kind of the dream. Was that the beginning of your

86
00:05:46,285 --> 00:05:46,485
Speaker 3:  test?

87
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:50,445
Speaker 4:  That was where I started standing in front of my giant tablet in the fridge,

88
00:05:50,505 --> 00:05:54,125
Speaker 4:  in my kitchen. And that did not go that well.

89
00:05:54,885 --> 00:05:58,485
Speaker 4:  I hate to say Okay, there were tools there that were better than the last

90
00:05:58,485 --> 00:06:01,685
Speaker 4:  time I had tried this because when I first got the fridge it did have some

91
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:05,445
Speaker 4:  of these capabilities to tell you what was in them. And those have been

92
00:06:05,445 --> 00:06:08,965
Speaker 4:  upgraded over the years, which is a good thing about a lot of these smart

93
00:06:08,965 --> 00:06:12,845
Speaker 4:  kitchen appliances. As I mentioned, I started this about two years ago.

94
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:16,365
Speaker 4:  I got a lot of smart appliances, although I've had my fridge for longer and

95
00:06:16,445 --> 00:06:20,285
Speaker 4:  I, over those two years more features have come. I can now voice control

96
00:06:20,385 --> 00:06:24,125
Speaker 4:  my oven to an extent and the smart fridge

97
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:28,165
Speaker 4:  can now recognize more foods, but it it, it didn't do it very well.

98
00:06:28,715 --> 00:06:32,325
Speaker 4:  Looking here it thinks my hummus is a salmon filet.

99
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:36,685
Speaker 4:  It thinks my salmon filet is meat and it

100
00:06:36,685 --> 00:06:40,445
Speaker 4:  seems to think my sour cream pot is a sandwich

101
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:45,285
Speaker 4:  and the whipped cream is a sports drink,

102
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:50,045
Speaker 4:  so, Hmm. Not entirely accurate. So it would've just been quicker for me to

103
00:06:50,155 --> 00:06:54,045
Speaker 4:  dictate a note into Siri of what was in my fridge rather than using the,

104
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:58,485
Speaker 4:  the food app. And, but the pieces and parts are there. So

105
00:06:59,205 --> 00:07:02,925
Speaker 4:  I could add using voice using Bixby, which was a new experience for me

106
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:06,405
Speaker 4:  'cause I've never used Bixby before. And that Samsung's voice assistant that's

107
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:10,365
Speaker 4:  built into my fridge and I was able to add all the food that was in my

108
00:07:10,365 --> 00:07:14,285
Speaker 4:  pantry to the food list so that I would have this master list. you

109
00:07:14,285 --> 00:07:17,405
Speaker 4:  know, that's kind of the ultimate goal that I would love the smart kitchen

110
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:20,725
Speaker 4:  to be able to do for me is keep track of what food I have. If I went and

111
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:24,485
Speaker 4:  bought that fancy Asian sauce for my one dish that I made

112
00:07:24,665 --> 00:07:28,045
Speaker 4:  two months ago, well can you suggest another recipe that I could use for

113
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:31,965
Speaker 4:  it? 'cause you know what I have in my pantry and make use of

114
00:07:31,965 --> 00:07:35,885
Speaker 4:  the food that's in your house rather than having to go buy it. And I

115
00:07:35,885 --> 00:07:39,685
Speaker 4:  was really hoping that once I put all of my food into the food

116
00:07:39,685 --> 00:07:43,125
Speaker 4:  list, which wasn't too laborious but certainly isn't something I'd want to

117
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,965
Speaker 4:  do regularly, it would spit out a meal plan sort of using

118
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:51,205
Speaker 4:  the food that I had. And it didn't do that. There were portions where

119
00:07:51,245 --> 00:07:54,965
Speaker 4:  I could go and sort of look in a section where my food was and say,

120
00:07:54,965 --> 00:07:57,885
Speaker 4:  okay, suggest recipes for me and then I could add those to my favorites and

121
00:07:57,885 --> 00:08:00,765
Speaker 4:  then I could go add those to my meal plan. But you know, that's a lot of

122
00:08:00,765 --> 00:08:04,405
Speaker 4:  steps. So that was a bit of a, that was a bit of a, a downside. And then

123
00:08:04,465 --> 00:08:07,765
Speaker 4:  the other thing that I really think it should do, and I did talk to Nick

124
00:08:07,765 --> 00:08:11,085
Speaker 4:  about this during the process and I said, is this something you're gonna

125
00:08:11,085 --> 00:08:14,685
Speaker 4:  bring to Samsung food? So I. I abandoned my Amazon

126
00:08:15,005 --> 00:08:18,685
Speaker 4:  a shopping list, which is what I normally use. And I used the Samsung food

127
00:08:18,845 --> 00:08:22,405
Speaker 4:  shopping list and then I ordered all the food through The Samsung Food

128
00:08:22,865 --> 00:08:26,765
Speaker 4:  app that connects to Instacart. And I said, okay, now

129
00:08:26,765 --> 00:08:30,405
Speaker 4:  shouldn't all of the food I just bought suddenly now be in my

130
00:08:30,915 --> 00:08:34,645
Speaker 4:  food list? Right. So I don't have to manually input. It seems logical.

131
00:08:35,105 --> 00:08:38,885
Speaker 4:  No, it doesn't do that. So I.

132
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,805
Speaker 4:  That was when I gave up on the food list. I'm like, I'm not doing this again.

133
00:08:42,985 --> 00:08:46,365
Speaker 3:  It is one of those things I think with both recipe

134
00:08:46,655 --> 00:08:50,485
Speaker 3:  collection and that sort of grocery shopping

135
00:08:51,325 --> 00:08:55,045
Speaker 3:  creation side of things this whole industry is, is you can see all of the

136
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:58,765
Speaker 3:  pieces. Yeah. And no one is actually putting any of them together. Yeah.

137
00:08:58,765 --> 00:09:02,565
Speaker 3:  Like I use this really lovely recipes app called, I think it's

138
00:09:02,765 --> 00:09:06,365
Speaker 3:  Mila, MELA. And it's beautiful. It does a really good job of

139
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:10,205
Speaker 3:  parsing recipes and putting it in and it does an awful job of just

140
00:09:10,205 --> 00:09:14,005
Speaker 3:  being like, Hey, remember this thing that you've cooked 10 times? Why are

141
00:09:14,005 --> 00:09:17,285
Speaker 3:  you saving another blueberry muffins recipe? You already have one that you

142
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:20,885
Speaker 3:  seem to like very much. And also remember how you've made blueberry muffins

143
00:09:20,885 --> 00:09:24,485
Speaker 3:  11 sundaes in a row. Here's the blueberry muffins recipe. Like there, there's

144
00:09:24,485 --> 00:09:27,965
Speaker 3:  just all these little pieces of it that feel like it's actually not

145
00:09:28,395 --> 00:09:32,045
Speaker 3:  more intelligence we need. It's just putting all of these little pieces together,

146
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:35,285
Speaker 3:  which I guess to some extent is the story of the smart kitchen. Yes. Like

147
00:09:35,285 --> 00:09:39,205
Speaker 3:  it's all in there. Yes. It's just a matter of making it sort of make

148
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:40,205
Speaker 3:  sense as a whole.

149
00:09:40,505 --> 00:09:43,365
Speaker 4:  We have the ingredients, we just don't have the finished product.

150
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:47,845
Speaker 3:  Oh boy. There's a metaphor for you. This just became the most meta episode

151
00:09:47,845 --> 00:09:51,565
Speaker 3:  of the verse cast we've ever done. I love it. Okay, so

152
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,645
Speaker 3:  that was the beginning of the process. Yes. But you, you acquired food. Yes.

153
00:09:54,645 --> 00:09:58,605
Speaker 3:  You had ingredients in your house. What was day one's experience?

154
00:09:58,635 --> 00:09:59,605
Speaker 3:  What did you do the first time?

155
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:03,365
Speaker 4:  So for some reason meal plans like to try and start you on a Monday and I

156
00:10:03,365 --> 00:10:06,645
Speaker 4:  was like, no, no, no, no. I need the weekend for this. So. I started, I started

157
00:10:06,665 --> 00:10:10,365
Speaker 4:  on a Saturday and it was actually a holiday weekend. So you know, I had plenty

158
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:14,245
Speaker 4:  of time and as I've mentioned before, I really enjoy cooking. So you know,

159
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:18,045
Speaker 4:  this was fun for me to do and to sort of test out all of these gadgets that

160
00:10:18,045 --> 00:10:21,925
Speaker 4:  I hadn't really spent a lot of time with outside of work. And yeah,

161
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:25,605
Speaker 4:  it was, the first day was, was really kind of fun because I was making dishes

162
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:29,645
Speaker 4:  I'd never really made myself before because I'm not very good at them and

163
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:33,005
Speaker 4:  things that my family really enjoys. Like one of the first things I did on

164
00:10:33,005 --> 00:10:36,525
Speaker 4:  Sunday morning was make biscuits and gravy, which is my husband's favorite

165
00:10:36,715 --> 00:10:40,205
Speaker 4:  dish. I'm gonna try and make it from scratch using

166
00:10:40,705 --> 00:10:44,205
Speaker 4:  my Thermomix mix. I did not think my Thermomix mix could make biscuits and

167
00:10:44,285 --> 00:10:47,885
Speaker 4:  gravy, but apparently it can. And it tells me it will only take me 20 minutes

168
00:10:47,905 --> 00:10:51,845
Speaker 4:  of prep time and then 20 minutes of cooking. That seems pretty fast for

169
00:10:51,845 --> 00:10:55,805
Speaker 4:  Sunday morning breakfast, Therma Mix, my favorite, still my favorite smart

170
00:10:55,805 --> 00:10:59,045
Speaker 4:  kitchen gadget. I have to say even that it's siloed in its own little ecosystem,

171
00:10:59,385 --> 00:11:02,805
Speaker 4:  but it can't bake. So, I got to use my oven for that purpose. And that was

172
00:11:02,805 --> 00:11:06,485
Speaker 4:  where I ran into some issues with voice control because this is another

173
00:11:06,635 --> 00:11:10,565
Speaker 4:  area where the smart kitchen feels like it should work. Well

174
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:14,365
Speaker 4:  voice control is a natural interface you would think for a kitchen

175
00:11:14,655 --> 00:11:18,085
Speaker 4:  where your hands are often busy and you're not holding your phone

176
00:11:18,585 --> 00:11:22,445
Speaker 4:  and it's still tricky. There's difficult nomenclature.

177
00:11:22,805 --> 00:11:26,245
Speaker 4:  I really struggled to get my oven to preheat using

178
00:11:26,575 --> 00:11:27,445
Speaker 4:  voice commands.

179
00:11:30,235 --> 00:11:33,735
Speaker 4:  And this also leads to another issue with the smart kitchen safety.

180
00:11:34,105 --> 00:11:37,975
Speaker 4:  There are so many sort of checks and balances put in by manufacturers

181
00:11:38,015 --> 00:11:40,975
Speaker 4:  I assume, who want to make sure that I don't maim myself or kill myself or

182
00:11:40,975 --> 00:11:42,815
Speaker 4:  burn my house down. Which is fair enough. Seems

183
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:43,655
Speaker 3:  Reasonable. Yeah.

184
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:47,935
Speaker 4:  But still causes friction and that's the one thing you don't want in the

185
00:11:47,935 --> 00:11:51,735
Speaker 4:  cooking process is friction. So the voice control, I feel

186
00:11:52,135 --> 00:11:55,485
Speaker 4:  ultimately I, and this might be a bit pie in the sky and you, you can, you'll

187
00:11:55,605 --> 00:11:58,925
Speaker 4:  probably shoot it down, but I think voice control would work better in the

188
00:11:58,925 --> 00:12:02,525
Speaker 4:  kitchen if it was in each appliance as opposed to a

189
00:12:02,635 --> 00:12:06,565
Speaker 4:  universal control that's trying to understand what you are addressing.

190
00:12:06,565 --> 00:12:09,685
Speaker 4:  So if I could talk to my oven and say preheat to,

191
00:12:10,545 --> 00:12:14,285
Speaker 4:  as opposed to having to ask Alexa to do it for me. And then

192
00:12:14,505 --> 00:12:17,685
Speaker 4:  it had this really annoying thing where it would If, you asked to preheat

193
00:12:17,685 --> 00:12:21,405
Speaker 4:  it automatically does it at 350 degrees. It, it didn't let me set

194
00:12:21,405 --> 00:12:25,205
Speaker 4:  what I wanted it to be. And then when I said, okay, don't do that, then

195
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:29,485
Speaker 4:  I want you to bake at 350 or 375 degrees, which

196
00:12:29,485 --> 00:12:33,325
Speaker 4:  is what I wanted. It does it. And it said okay, I will set the oven for an

197
00:12:33,325 --> 00:12:36,285
Speaker 4:  hour. I didn't tell it to set the oven for an hour. I didn't think about

198
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:39,365
Speaker 4:  the fact that I told it to set the oven for an hour. Two hours later when

199
00:12:39,365 --> 00:12:42,125
Speaker 4:  I went to go get my food, it was only half cooked because the Oven had turned

200
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:46,045
Speaker 4:  off and an hour. Oh geez. So yeah, not, not a

201
00:12:46,045 --> 00:12:46,645
Speaker 4:  good experience.

202
00:12:47,045 --> 00:12:50,965
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I do agree with you by the way, one of my most closely held

203
00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:54,725
Speaker 3:  theories about voice assistance is that every device

204
00:12:54,825 --> 00:12:58,485
Speaker 3:  should have its own and you should address the device, not

205
00:12:58,485 --> 00:13:02,405
Speaker 3:  address an assistant. Yes. About a device. Yes. I just think that

206
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:06,285
Speaker 3:  paradigm just doesn't make sense in a way that I want, I wanna look at my

207
00:13:06,305 --> 00:13:10,245
Speaker 3:  TV and say, Hey TV play ESPN and I wanna look at my Oven and

208
00:13:10,245 --> 00:13:13,565
Speaker 3:  say, hey Oven preheat to three 50. That's just, that just

209
00:13:13,635 --> 00:13:16,605
Speaker 3:  intuitively makes more sense than saying it does, you know, Hey

210
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:22,485
Speaker 3:  tell my GE smart oven to pre, like that's, that's nothing. You've lost me

211
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:26,445
Speaker 3:  at that point. Yes it is one of those things that that bar for all of

212
00:13:26,445 --> 00:13:29,725
Speaker 3:  this is, it has to be easier than walking over to it and pushing the buttons.

213
00:13:29,865 --> 00:13:33,605
Speaker 3:  And that's a really, really, really, really, really high bar to clear. But

214
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:36,485
Speaker 3:  if I can look at it from across the kitchen and say preheat to three 50,

215
00:13:36,675 --> 00:13:38,805
Speaker 3:  that does it. As long as it works.

216
00:13:39,225 --> 00:13:39,445
Speaker 4:  Yes.

217
00:13:39,905 --> 00:13:40,485
Speaker 3:  But it doesn't.

218
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:44,885
Speaker 4:  I have used individual devices with built-in voice control and they have

219
00:13:44,885 --> 00:13:48,125
Speaker 4:  never been good. you know, that's the, that's the hard part here is you're

220
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:51,845
Speaker 4:  asking a oven manufacturer to come up with a good voice assistant

221
00:13:52,225 --> 00:13:56,125
Speaker 4:  and I, I've used it in like robot vacuums and a few other devices and

222
00:13:56,275 --> 00:13:59,765
Speaker 4:  it's, it's just, you know, Amazon and Google and

223
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:03,485
Speaker 4:  Apple to some extent have nailed a good experience

224
00:14:04,075 --> 00:14:07,965
Speaker 4:  that not always perfect, but it's a lot better than you're gonna find most

225
00:14:07,965 --> 00:14:11,165
Speaker 4:  other places. Although I know Amazon does have this system where you can,

226
00:14:11,335 --> 00:14:15,045
Speaker 4:  developers can come to them and ask them to help them make like the Hey Disney

227
00:14:15,585 --> 00:14:19,525
Speaker 4:  is one of those examples. So I could see a future where this becomes possible.

228
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:23,605
Speaker 4:  And yes, I agree that would've, that would've made the voice experience work

229
00:14:23,665 --> 00:14:27,285
Speaker 4:  in my kitchen. And today it is not a good experience.

230
00:14:28,025 --> 00:14:32,005
Speaker 3:  So I, I'm curious at the beginning of this process, how much

231
00:14:32,065 --> 00:14:35,685
Speaker 3:  you had to force yourself to like do the smart

232
00:14:35,895 --> 00:14:38,845
Speaker 3:  thing in the kitchen, like quote unquote smart thing in the kitchen, right?

233
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:42,885
Speaker 3:  Because we asked you basically go way out of your way to use the

234
00:14:42,885 --> 00:14:46,765
Speaker 3:  smartness of these appliances. Did it occur to you at the beginning how many

235
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:49,885
Speaker 3:  times you had to stop and be like, okay, I have to not do this the way I

236
00:14:49,885 --> 00:14:53,405
Speaker 3:  would normally do this even with the same appliance in order to do the

237
00:14:53,755 --> 00:14:55,685
Speaker 3:  most technology forward part of

238
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:59,045
Speaker 4:  This? Yes, a lot. I had to do that a lot and it was frustrating

239
00:14:59,725 --> 00:15:03,565
Speaker 4:  because this is another issue that I've felt was a problem with the

240
00:15:03,565 --> 00:15:07,445
Speaker 4:  smart kitchen is that the app control of appliances is largely

241
00:15:08,315 --> 00:15:12,045
Speaker 4:  pointless. And when it is useful it does

242
00:15:12,265 --> 00:15:15,965
Speaker 4:  add extra steps. There are two examples. So I have

243
00:15:16,105 --> 00:15:19,965
Speaker 4:  two smart Countertop ovens that I've tested. There's the Valla and

244
00:15:19,965 --> 00:15:23,685
Speaker 4:  the Typhur. The Typhur is an Air Fryer, it's like a dome air

245
00:15:23,685 --> 00:15:27,285
Speaker 4:  Fryer and it is the best air Fryer I have ever used. It's

246
00:15:27,645 --> 00:15:31,565
Speaker 4:  awesome. But the app makes no sense. There's just no

247
00:15:31,575 --> 00:15:35,245
Speaker 4:  point to me in using the app. The only thing it can do is

248
00:15:35,395 --> 00:15:39,325
Speaker 4:  send the settings for a recipe I find in its own app,

249
00:15:39,335 --> 00:15:43,085
Speaker 4:  which is limited and that's somewhat useful. But the control panel

250
00:15:43,145 --> 00:15:47,085
Speaker 4:  is very simple and easy and it's just as easy to hit the buttons. And So

251
00:15:47,165 --> 00:15:50,365
Speaker 4:  I had kind of, I've had this Typhur for about three weeks and I've been testing

252
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:54,405
Speaker 4:  it and I never use the app and I, for this process I was

253
00:15:54,405 --> 00:15:57,245
Speaker 4:  like okay, I've got to make sure to use the app. And I was like, it wouldn't

254
00:15:57,245 --> 00:16:01,085
Speaker 4:  let me preheat, preheat, Oven to bake 400

255
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:01,525
Speaker 4:  degrees.

256
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:06,885
Speaker 5:  Sorry, I couldn't find anything to do that. To get started you'll

257
00:16:06,885 --> 00:16:08,205
Speaker 5:  need a smart kitchen appliance.

258
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:12,565
Speaker 4:  Okay. But I have a smart kitchen appliance. All right nomenclature,

259
00:16:12,825 --> 00:16:15,645
Speaker 4:  I'm probably saying it wrong. How about just

260
00:16:16,795 --> 00:16:18,205
Speaker 4:  tell my oven to preheat.

261
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:23,525
Speaker 5:  Okay, bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for one hour.

262
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:28,495
Speaker 4:  I had to preheat on the device, then go back to the app, choose

263
00:16:28,495 --> 00:16:32,455
Speaker 4:  the recipe and send those settings Once it finished preheating

264
00:16:32,455 --> 00:16:36,415
Speaker 4:  and it was like this is not useful. And then with the

265
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:40,575
Speaker 4:  valla, all you can do is send the settings. I can't add cooking

266
00:16:40,575 --> 00:16:43,855
Speaker 4:  time. Like the Valla is a great little lunchtime cooking

267
00:16:44,245 --> 00:16:47,775
Speaker 4:  machine. 'cause you know, If, you just want to reheat dinner for lunch. I

268
00:16:47,775 --> 00:16:51,415
Speaker 4:  don't wanna heat up my entire Thermador range, So, I just use this little

269
00:16:51,415 --> 00:16:55,215
Speaker 4:  Countertop oven. But sometimes it takes longer and

270
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:58,175
Speaker 4:  I'm like, oh I wanna add an extra five minutes for my desk and I'd love to

271
00:16:58,175 --> 00:17:01,135
Speaker 4:  be able to just press five minutes on the app. But no, you have to go back

272
00:17:01,135 --> 00:17:05,055
Speaker 4:  to the device and press the button. And it's like, what is the smart

273
00:17:05,085 --> 00:17:08,295
Speaker 4:  element here? There isn't really, and I get, again, this probably goes back

274
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:12,015
Speaker 4:  to the safety issue, unattended appliances that can reach

275
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:15,495
Speaker 4:  over 450 degrees. You know, they wanna make sure that you really meant to

276
00:17:15,495 --> 00:17:19,415
Speaker 4:  do that. And I get that. But yeah, that was frustrating. The

277
00:17:19,575 --> 00:17:23,295
Speaker 4:  only benefit I find there with the app is for

278
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:27,535
Speaker 4:  a more complicated device. So the Instapot for example, which

279
00:17:27,575 --> 00:17:31,055
Speaker 4:  I have, I was testing the Instapot Pro Plus, which is

280
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:34,815
Speaker 4:  Instant Pot's first sort of truly smart device. And it

281
00:17:34,985 --> 00:17:38,775
Speaker 4:  works with Fresco, the smart home, the smart kitchen platform.

282
00:17:39,235 --> 00:17:42,615
Speaker 4:  And in its app you, once you choose the recipe,

283
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:47,135
Speaker 4:  it will send the precise settings to the Instapot. And if you've

284
00:17:47,135 --> 00:17:50,300
Speaker 4:  used an Instapot, especially one like this, that that has a big screen with

285
00:17:50,305 --> 00:17:54,205
Speaker 4:  all sorts of complicated settings on, it's, it was so much easy. I had

286
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:56,605
Speaker 4:  no idea what I was doing. I was like so nice to be able to just press the

287
00:17:56,605 --> 00:17:59,645
Speaker 4:  button and they all showed up. Especially as the Instapot, it's kind of a

288
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:03,605
Speaker 4:  scary device. 'cause when it stops, it lets off all the steam, which I think

289
00:18:03,605 --> 00:18:04,605
Speaker 4:  we have a clip of that too.

290
00:18:06,675 --> 00:18:09,715
Speaker 4:  I was really scared of the Instapot. I put it like in the middle of the counter,

291
00:18:09,825 --> 00:18:12,355
Speaker 4:  like in the middle of my kitchen. I didn't want it near anything that might

292
00:18:12,355 --> 00:18:12,755
Speaker 4:  explode.

293
00:18:13,345 --> 00:18:17,075
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I'm so hung up on this idea of not being able to

294
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:20,595
Speaker 3:  preheat stuff remotely. Because I think to some extent

295
00:18:20,855 --> 00:18:23,875
Speaker 3:  one of the challenges for the smart kitchen is that you're, you're in your

296
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:27,435
Speaker 3:  kitchen typically when you're cooking. one of the reasons I think things

297
00:18:27,435 --> 00:18:31,355
Speaker 3:  like meal planning and grocery shopping for you is interesting

298
00:18:31,355 --> 00:18:34,555
Speaker 3:  is that that is stuff that can theoretically be done without you and that

299
00:18:34,555 --> 00:18:38,075
Speaker 3:  you're actually kind of happy to do remotely. But the odds of you wanting

300
00:18:38,095 --> 00:18:41,875
Speaker 3:  to make dinner without ever setting foot in your kitchen is both

301
00:18:42,225 --> 00:18:45,475
Speaker 3:  implausible and just kind of not realistic. Right? But the idea that I should

302
00:18:45,475 --> 00:18:49,395
Speaker 3:  be able to walk into my kitchen and my oven is preheated. Yeah. Seems

303
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:53,235
Speaker 3:  like the simplest, most useful thing to do.

304
00:18:53,325 --> 00:18:57,035
Speaker 3:  Right? Like I made dinner last night and my, my Grill is

305
00:18:57,085 --> 00:19:00,955
Speaker 3:  downstairs in our back patio and our kitchen is upstairs and all

306
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:04,755
Speaker 3:  I want in the whole world is to be able to point my phone at my Grill and

307
00:19:04,755 --> 00:19:07,875
Speaker 3:  say, Grill turn on while I'm standing in my kitchen

308
00:19:08,595 --> 00:19:12,515
Speaker 3:  prepping stuff. Yeah. And you just can't do that. No. And part of

309
00:19:12,515 --> 00:19:16,355
Speaker 3:  it is because of these totally valid and maybe slightly overbearing safety

310
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:20,075
Speaker 3:  things, but all reasons aside, that's the lowest

311
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:23,635
Speaker 3:  hanging fruit I can think of in the smart kitchen. And we still can't get

312
00:19:23,635 --> 00:19:27,195
Speaker 4:  It. We can't, no, I have So, I have tested the smart Traeger

313
00:19:27,535 --> 00:19:31,395
Speaker 4:  Smoker, outdoor Smoker and you can control the entire thing from the

314
00:19:31,395 --> 00:19:35,035
Speaker 4:  app change settings as it goes, which is great. But to

315
00:19:35,355 --> 00:19:38,755
Speaker 4:  actually start it, you have to go press the button. It will not let you do

316
00:19:38,755 --> 00:19:42,315
Speaker 4:  it. And the, the Thermador oven, so when I first got the Thermador,

317
00:19:42,695 --> 00:19:46,395
Speaker 4:  the only remote control option was by turning a dial

318
00:19:46,855 --> 00:19:50,475
Speaker 4:  to remote control. Then you could use your smartphone

319
00:19:51,305 --> 00:19:55,115
Speaker 4:  from anywhere. So I could preheat from anywhere. But I had, I would've had

320
00:19:55,115 --> 00:19:58,555
Speaker 4:  to have remembered to turn the dial to remote control before I left the house.

321
00:19:58,555 --> 00:20:02,395
Speaker 4:  Which is not something that's top of my list of things to do. And there

322
00:20:02,415 --> 00:20:06,235
Speaker 4:  has been an update I discovered during this testing that it

323
00:20:06,295 --> 00:20:10,115
Speaker 4:  should allow me to enable permanent remote start through the app.

324
00:20:10,715 --> 00:20:14,155
Speaker 4:  I spent a good half an hour and I couldn't get it to work. It just, wouldn't

325
00:20:14,155 --> 00:20:17,235
Speaker 4:  it, it just wouldn't let me do it. I, I don't know, maybe this is something

326
00:20:17,235 --> 00:20:20,115
Speaker 4:  that's coming soon and they just didn't make that clear enough in the app.

327
00:20:20,175 --> 00:20:23,555
Speaker 4:  But So I, I was actually at watching my son play tennis

328
00:20:24,535 --> 00:20:28,475
Speaker 4:  and it was on the match was going long and I knew I had, I had a

329
00:20:28,475 --> 00:20:32,435
Speaker 4:  chicken enchilada ready to cook. I was going to start cooking chicken enchiladas

330
00:20:32,435 --> 00:20:34,715
Speaker 4:  when I got home. I knew it was gonna be a long process. So I was like, okay,

331
00:20:34,715 --> 00:20:38,315
Speaker 4:  I'll preheat the oven from the app while I'm watching tennis

332
00:20:39,015 --> 00:20:42,715
Speaker 4:  and no luck. So you know, I had to do the fallback, which was text my husband

333
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:44,475
Speaker 4:  and tell him to get off the couch and go preheat

334
00:20:44,475 --> 00:20:47,245
Speaker 3:  The ice. There's the smart kitchen right there. That works too. Now you're

335
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:51,125
Speaker 3:  talking. Okay, so what else did you make over the course of this experiment?

336
00:20:51,205 --> 00:20:54,605
Speaker 3:  I won't, I won't make you go day by day, but did you have any particularly

337
00:20:55,275 --> 00:20:57,805
Speaker 3:  telling experiences? What else did you make? Oh

338
00:20:57,805 --> 00:21:01,645
Speaker 4:  Gosh, I made, so for the, the long holiday weekend I did a Saturday morning

339
00:21:01,645 --> 00:21:05,205
Speaker 4:  for tartar. That was kind of fun because what I did there was I

340
00:21:05,485 --> 00:21:09,285
Speaker 4:  used, so Samsung food has this feature where you can take a picture

341
00:21:09,345 --> 00:21:13,125
Speaker 4:  of ingredients and it will suggest recipes for you. So

342
00:21:13,725 --> 00:21:17,445
Speaker 4:  I, I mean it's limited usefulness I suppose because you know, you could just

343
00:21:17,445 --> 00:21:20,685
Speaker 4:  Google, okay I have eggs, I have pork, I have,

344
00:21:21,265 --> 00:21:22,285
Speaker 4:  but it was kind of fun,

345
00:21:22,725 --> 00:21:26,485
Speaker 3:  Which is a great way to cook by the way. I've actually had a lot of fun being

346
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:29,805
Speaker 3:  like, I have half a pound of ground Turkey, this

347
00:21:30,145 --> 00:21:34,085
Speaker 3:  Korean barbecue sauce that I forgot about and bok

348
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:37,285
Speaker 3:  choy, what can I make? What can I make? And, and you just sort of make whatever

349
00:21:37,285 --> 00:21:40,645
Speaker 3:  comes up. It's actually a pretty fun way to kind of empty the fridge of all

350
00:21:40,645 --> 00:21:41,485
Speaker 3:  the strange stuff you have.

351
00:21:41,595 --> 00:21:44,965
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And that was, you know, that was what I did with this. I, I So I do

352
00:21:44,965 --> 00:21:48,925
Speaker 4:  a CSA and I live in the south and I often get a lot of random

353
00:21:49,285 --> 00:21:53,085
Speaker 4:  vegetables that I have no idea what to do with. Although unfortunately Samsung

354
00:21:53,115 --> 00:21:56,605
Speaker 4:  food did not know what to do with most of them either because they were a

355
00:21:56,605 --> 00:22:00,485
Speaker 4:  bit random. but it gave me inspiration I would say, as opposed

356
00:22:00,505 --> 00:22:04,325
Speaker 4:  to effectively giving me a good dish. I, I had

357
00:22:04,355 --> 00:22:08,245
Speaker 4:  pork, I had ground pork, I had eggs, I just got from my chickens and I

358
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:11,845
Speaker 4:  had some vegetables and some potatoes and it thought it was mince beef,

359
00:22:12,505 --> 00:22:16,165
Speaker 4:  not pork, you know, it didn't get everything right. but it did come up with

360
00:22:16,165 --> 00:22:20,085
Speaker 4:  an idea of the frittata using the potatoes and the eggs. So I ended up

361
00:22:20,085 --> 00:22:23,765
Speaker 4:  doing nice frittata, which is something I used to cook all the time and I'd

362
00:22:23,765 --> 00:22:26,485
Speaker 4:  sort of forgotten about. So that was nice kind of getting the inspiration.

363
00:22:26,985 --> 00:22:30,645
Speaker 4:  And then what else did I do? So on the big sort of holiday lunch

364
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:35,005
Speaker 4:  I had planned to do a smoked pork butt. So

365
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:38,605
Speaker 4:  I've been testing the GE profile, indoor smart Smoker,

366
00:22:39,045 --> 00:22:42,365
Speaker 4:  which again is connected, but connectivity is

367
00:22:42,575 --> 00:22:46,525
Speaker 4:  relatively limited. Doesn't really do a lot for me, but it is a really

368
00:22:46,805 --> 00:22:50,605
Speaker 4:  interesting piece of tech being able to use a Smoker indoors. I mean, I'm

369
00:22:50,605 --> 00:22:53,885
Speaker 4:  lucky enough to have a backyard where I can use a Smoker, but I know I've,

370
00:22:53,885 --> 00:22:56,205
Speaker 4:  I've heard a lot of people that were very excited about the prospect of being

371
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:59,365
Speaker 4:  able to, you know, smoke some, smoke some butt indoors.

372
00:22:59,605 --> 00:23:03,245
Speaker 3:  There are a lot of people with like smokers on fire escapes.

373
00:23:03,505 --> 00:23:07,485
Speaker 3:  Yes. And all kinds of deeply dangerous things going on just in

374
00:23:07,485 --> 00:23:08,205
Speaker 3:  the name of the flavor.

375
00:23:08,515 --> 00:23:12,045
Speaker 4:  This is also an example of a, a smart appliance that I was hoping would help

376
00:23:12,045 --> 00:23:15,565
Speaker 4:  me cook better because barbecue is an art

377
00:23:16,065 --> 00:23:19,565
Speaker 4:  and you know, again, live in the south I'm familiar like there's a lot of

378
00:23:19,725 --> 00:23:23,445
Speaker 4:  barbecue places around here and I love me some brisket and some good

379
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:27,365
Speaker 4:  pulled pork. And I did try brisket, I did try pulled pork

380
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:30,805
Speaker 4:  smoked butt and none of it worked out very well. Oh no.

381
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:33,045
Speaker 3:  What, how come, what happened? I don't

382
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:36,965
Speaker 4:  Know. I put it in there for the 10 hours that it told me to

383
00:23:37,265 --> 00:23:40,605
Speaker 4:  and in the end it just came out kind of rubbery and

384
00:23:40,695 --> 00:23:44,525
Speaker 4:  overcooked. So I, I, you know, there could have been user error but

385
00:23:44,685 --> 00:23:48,045
Speaker 4:  I think one of the things I was frustrated with, with this device compared

386
00:23:48,045 --> 00:23:51,645
Speaker 4:  to say the Traeger, which I've used before, the outdoor one

387
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:55,805
Speaker 4:  is the Traeger will automatically adjust the time and the temperature

388
00:23:56,255 --> 00:24:00,205
Speaker 4:  based on the probe. Whereas this device, it would just, you, you had

389
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:03,565
Speaker 4:  to monitor it and adjust it yourself. And I think, I think

390
00:24:03,915 --> 00:24:07,125
Speaker 4:  that was probably where the user error came in at some point that I didn't,

391
00:24:07,385 --> 00:24:11,245
Speaker 4:  didn't top up the pellets fast enough or, and

392
00:24:11,245 --> 00:24:14,605
Speaker 4:  it's so it stopped smoking and just started cooking, which probably overcooked

393
00:24:14,605 --> 00:24:18,165
Speaker 4:  it. I see. But yeah, that was unfortunately wasn't a huge success. But then

394
00:24:18,685 --> 00:24:22,485
Speaker 4:  I did salvage it and this was kind of fun. So the next day I decided to

395
00:24:22,485 --> 00:24:26,165
Speaker 4:  make faux ramen where you put like all fun things in

396
00:24:26,345 --> 00:24:30,205
Speaker 4:  noodle soup and I'd never made that before and my husband loves it

397
00:24:30,465 --> 00:24:34,285
Speaker 4:  and So I sliced the top of the pork butt off and turned it

398
00:24:34,285 --> 00:24:38,245
Speaker 4:  into pork belly to put in my ramen. So you know, I did things that I hadn't,

399
00:24:38,445 --> 00:24:42,245
Speaker 4:  I would never have thought about doing before because you know, I gave myself

400
00:24:42,245 --> 00:24:46,085
Speaker 4:  the time and the tools because making chocolate MOUs is not an easy

401
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:49,445
Speaker 4:  process. If, you aren't used to hand whisking

402
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:53,725
Speaker 4:  egg whites and heating chocolate at really high temperatures and that I could

403
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:57,165
Speaker 4:  use a Therma mix for. So a lot of the devices that I had,

404
00:24:57,995 --> 00:25:01,525
Speaker 4:  like the Therma mix, the GE profile, smart mix stand

405
00:25:01,695 --> 00:25:05,445
Speaker 4:  mixer, the Air Fryer and the Instapot, it did enable

406
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:08,845
Speaker 4:  me to do things that I would not have been able to do before. But this goes

407
00:25:08,845 --> 00:25:12,405
Speaker 4:  back to that issue that we've talked about in the past is these are great

408
00:25:12,405 --> 00:25:15,285
Speaker 4:  individual smart gadgets to have in your kitchen.

409
00:25:16,135 --> 00:25:19,805
Speaker 4:  Smart. Not just because they're connected to wifi, but because they are adding

410
00:25:19,835 --> 00:25:23,765
Speaker 4:  something to the process. They're making the process easier so

411
00:25:23,765 --> 00:25:27,685
Speaker 4:  you can create more fun foods at home and have more joy

412
00:25:28,105 --> 00:25:32,045
Speaker 4:  out of your cooking. But they were all really quite siloed in their own

413
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:35,925
Speaker 4:  ecosystems. And as soon as I get out of The Thermomix world or out of the

414
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:39,685
Speaker 4:  Instapot world, I have to start all over with another app or another

415
00:25:39,775 --> 00:25:43,645
Speaker 4:  voice control or, and so that, that interoperability was something that

416
00:25:43,685 --> 00:25:47,045
Speaker 4:  I still came up against for ev you know, at every step of the way

417
00:25:47,395 --> 00:25:51,285
Speaker 4:  that isn't, there is no real solution yet to that, but individual

418
00:25:51,355 --> 00:25:55,245
Speaker 4:  devices in the smart kitchen are fun. If, you have enough

419
00:25:55,245 --> 00:25:55,805
Speaker 4:  counter space.

420
00:25:57,195 --> 00:26:00,445
Speaker 3:  That is a perfect segue. We need to take a break really fast, but then we're

421
00:26:00,445 --> 00:26:03,325
Speaker 3:  gonna come back and we're gonna talk about some of the takeaways and what

422
00:26:03,345 --> 00:26:06,045
Speaker 3:  we can all learn and smarten up in our kitchens about this. We'll be right

423
00:26:06,045 --> 00:26:06,205
Speaker 3:  back.

424
00:28:32,395 --> 00:28:36,295
Speaker 7:  Fox Creative, this is advertiser content from

425
00:28:36,295 --> 00:28:36,695
Speaker 7:  Kohler.

426
00:28:38,015 --> 00:28:40,855
Speaker 6:  I think when we think of design we're like beautiful poster,

427
00:28:42,015 --> 00:28:45,615
Speaker 6:  gorgeous graphics. But I also think design has like

428
00:28:46,655 --> 00:28:50,415
Speaker 6:  a place in making sure that people feel the best that they can be.

429
00:28:51,835 --> 00:28:55,815
Speaker 6:  Hi, I'm Laura Rado. I'm a group creative director of Vox Creative.

430
00:28:56,275 --> 00:29:00,015
Speaker 6:  During my nine to five and my five to nine, I've always got

431
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:03,215
Speaker 6:  good design on the brain. It's

432
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:08,095
Speaker 6:  metaphorically and physically glowing. It's like the

433
00:29:08,095 --> 00:29:11,855
Speaker 6:  Aurora Borealis, which is exactly why I was

434
00:29:11,915 --> 00:29:15,615
Speaker 6:  so excited to meet the new me 2.0 Kohler's

435
00:29:15,815 --> 00:29:19,215
Speaker 6:  smartest toilet. On first introduction,

436
00:29:20,035 --> 00:29:23,935
Speaker 6:  it legit just waved a hand at me, not actual waved a

437
00:29:23,935 --> 00:29:27,775
Speaker 6:  hand, but the lid moved up and greeted me

438
00:29:27,795 --> 00:29:31,775
Speaker 6:  for the use. But right now we're in a showroom. So I can't

439
00:29:31,935 --> 00:29:35,855
Speaker 6:  actually use it. Functions like this. A hands-free greeting

440
00:29:36,315 --> 00:29:39,695
Speaker 6:  and form combined in the newie to elevate the everyday.

441
00:29:40,565 --> 00:29:44,285
Speaker 6:  It's a sculpture that begs for someone to like

442
00:29:44,555 --> 00:29:48,165
Speaker 6:  rest their body on it and walk away feeling really comfortable.

443
00:29:48,845 --> 00:29:52,725
Speaker 6:  A temperature controlled bidet, the heated seat, automatic self

444
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:56,845
Speaker 6:  cleaning cycles, access to smart home functions thanks to a built in

445
00:29:56,845 --> 00:30:00,525
Speaker 6:  Alexa. The Numis got it all for everyone.

446
00:30:01,305 --> 00:30:05,205
Speaker 6:  The bottom has this really beautiful green glow and it's almost as if

447
00:30:05,205 --> 00:30:09,045
Speaker 6:  they knew that was my special color because If, you go into my bathroom at

448
00:30:09,045 --> 00:30:12,685
Speaker 6:  home, the entire bathroom is a mint green.

449
00:30:13,155 --> 00:30:17,005
Speaker 6:  It's like the new me knew that I was showing up. And what's really

450
00:30:17,005 --> 00:30:20,485
Speaker 6:  cool about this is that there is this like circular sphere

451
00:30:20,775 --> 00:30:24,605
Speaker 6:  metal piece that like allows for you to change the color on the bottom.

452
00:30:24,785 --> 00:30:28,005
Speaker 6:  So if I'm not in my mint green era, which I'm often am,

453
00:30:28,845 --> 00:30:32,165
Speaker 6:  I can be in another era. My like calming blue, my

454
00:30:32,555 --> 00:30:35,565
Speaker 6:  like rosy pink, like whatever I need to feel.

455
00:30:36,315 --> 00:30:39,835
Speaker 6:  It's, it's like the Sistine Chapel of Toilets

456
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:45,595
Speaker 6:  experience a fully connected oasis of clean and comfort

457
00:30:45,745 --> 00:30:48,115
Speaker 6:  with the new me 2.0. Learn

00:30:48,115 --> 00:30:49,835
Speaker 6:  more@kohler.com.

459
00:30:55,725 --> 00:30:59,495
Speaker 3:  Alright, we're back. So Jen, you've been through this whole experience, it

460
00:30:59,495 --> 00:31:03,295
Speaker 3:  sounds like it has been mostly interesting. I was gonna say

461
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:06,255
Speaker 3:  mostly good, but I'm not even sure that's true. but it has certainly been

462
00:31:06,455 --> 00:31:09,575
Speaker 3:  interesting. Let's talk about some takeaways from all of this because I think

463
00:31:10,055 --> 00:31:12,375
Speaker 3:  there are a lot of people who are looking around at their kitchen trying

464
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:16,215
Speaker 3:  to figure out what is useful to invest time and money

465
00:31:16,235 --> 00:31:19,375
Speaker 3:  and energy into figurine out. What apps should I download on my phone? Let's

466
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:22,815
Speaker 3:  help the people out here a little bit. So the first thing is,

467
00:31:23,275 --> 00:31:27,215
Speaker 3:  is smartening up your kitchen as much as possible? A good idea?

468
00:31:27,395 --> 00:31:30,415
Speaker 3:  Is this a goal people should have for their lives at this moment in time

469
00:31:30,795 --> 00:31:32,815
Speaker 3:  to try and get a very smart kitchen?

470
00:31:33,755 --> 00:31:37,375
Speaker 4:  No. Okay. Because things don't all work together,

471
00:31:37,955 --> 00:31:41,655
Speaker 4:  it can create chaos. If, you have too many smart devices,

472
00:31:41,795 --> 00:31:45,655
Speaker 4:  too many smart cooks in the kitchen spoil the broth. Your oatmeal

473
00:31:45,745 --> 00:31:49,695
Speaker 4:  timer is done, your oatmeal timer is done. Okay. It's mild chaos

474
00:31:49,755 --> 00:31:53,735
Speaker 4:  in here because my oatmeal timer is apparently

475
00:31:53,735 --> 00:31:57,455
Speaker 4:  done, my robot vacuum decided to start vacuuming because it's Monday morning

476
00:31:57,915 --> 00:32:01,895
Speaker 4:  and at some point my oven turned itself off and

477
00:32:01,895 --> 00:32:02,495
Speaker 4:  I don't know why.

478
00:32:03,365 --> 00:32:06,775
Speaker 3:  Okay, so if in theory we're gonna pick just

479
00:32:07,155 --> 00:32:11,095
Speaker 3:  one device to start with, I have a feeling I know the answer to this question

480
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:14,815
Speaker 3:  based on the many ways you have recommended The Thermomix in the past. but

481
00:32:14,815 --> 00:32:18,615
Speaker 3:  it does feel like the place to start is pick one or two of these kind of

482
00:32:18,935 --> 00:32:22,855
Speaker 3:  multipurpose, do lots of things, ideally interact with an

483
00:32:22,855 --> 00:32:26,735
Speaker 3:  app or each other or whatever, but start sort of appliance by appliance

484
00:32:26,735 --> 00:32:30,095
Speaker 3:  rather than thinking about your kitchen holistically.

485
00:32:30,425 --> 00:32:32,095
Speaker 3:  Where would you tell most people to start?

486
00:32:32,405 --> 00:32:36,015
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think it's, we're still a ways from the point where our holistic

487
00:32:36,015 --> 00:32:39,485
Speaker 4:  kitchen works well together. So, you know, I would If you if you're going

488
00:32:39,505 --> 00:32:43,365
Speaker 4:  out and buying new kitchen equipment, if you're gonna remodel your kitchen,

489
00:32:43,645 --> 00:32:47,485
Speaker 4:  I would definitely get an oven that has wifi connectivity because we know

490
00:32:47,485 --> 00:32:51,405
Speaker 4:  we're gonna have better capabilities in The future. And you can turn it off

491
00:32:51,415 --> 00:32:53,965
Speaker 4:  until you want it. you know, you don't have to connect it to the internet.

492
00:32:54,225 --> 00:32:58,125
Speaker 4:  But in terms of today, If, you want to get a gadget that's

493
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:01,645
Speaker 4:  going to improve your cooking experience. The

494
00:33:01,645 --> 00:33:05,445
Speaker 4:  Thermomix is a great device. It is very expensive though. I will caveat

495
00:33:05,515 --> 00:33:06,085
Speaker 4:  with that. It's

496
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:07,325
Speaker 3:  Like $1,500 or something, right?

497
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:12,005
Speaker 4:  But it does a lot. It's like seven things in one. And

498
00:33:12,265 --> 00:33:15,365
Speaker 4:  one of the great things about, and this is sort of what I feel like is a

499
00:33:15,365 --> 00:33:18,965
Speaker 4:  sort of goal for all smart kitchen appliances, is that it

500
00:33:19,355 --> 00:33:23,165
Speaker 4:  does make the cooking process easier and it helps you do things

501
00:33:23,165 --> 00:33:27,005
Speaker 4:  that you wouldn't necessarily be able to have done before because of,

502
00:33:27,065 --> 00:33:31,045
Speaker 4:  and it keeps it all in one device. So cleanup is minimal. This

503
00:33:31,045 --> 00:33:34,965
Speaker 4:  is an area we have not fixed. My kitchen is a mess right

504
00:33:34,965 --> 00:33:37,125
Speaker 4:  now, in fact, would you come and help me clean up?

505
00:33:37,705 --> 00:33:38,685
Speaker 3:  No, no thanks.

506
00:33:40,115 --> 00:33:43,965
Speaker 4:  Because yeah, chaos rains when you do a lot of cooking in your house

507
00:33:44,145 --> 00:33:47,485
Speaker 4:  and yes, we have the dishwasher but someone still has to load it and unload

508
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:51,205
Speaker 4:  it and yeah, I I, I did not find a solution to keeping my kitchen clean other

509
00:33:51,205 --> 00:33:55,005
Speaker 4:  than running my robot vacuum cleaner, which got in my way a lot. But yes,

510
00:33:55,185 --> 00:33:58,965
Speaker 4:  and as as a single device, The Thermomix actually has guided

511
00:33:58,965 --> 00:34:02,445
Speaker 4:  cooking. This was the one area I did find has improved

512
00:34:02,445 --> 00:34:06,285
Speaker 4:  significantly in my testing this last week is guided

513
00:34:06,285 --> 00:34:09,925
Speaker 4:  cooking has become a lot better. I used to use smart

514
00:34:10,005 --> 00:34:13,645
Speaker 4:  displays to try and do some guided cooking like Amazon's and

515
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:15,925
Speaker 4:  Google's have these functions built in.

516
00:34:16,185 --> 00:34:18,725
Speaker 3:  And that's mostly, you just kind of like load the thing and sort of swipe

517
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:20,285
Speaker 3:  from step to step in the recipe, right?

518
00:34:20,285 --> 00:34:23,765
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Okay. And it can also sometimes read out the steps for you

519
00:34:24,065 --> 00:34:27,085
Speaker 4:  and my fridge can read out the steps for me, but it does it really fast really,

520
00:34:27,085 --> 00:34:30,925
Speaker 4:  really quickly. And it's not very pleasant experience. But

521
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:34,765
Speaker 4:  The Thermomix has a built-in screen with the guided steps. So

522
00:34:34,785 --> 00:34:38,525
Speaker 4:  as you go along you're just following the guided steps. And that

523
00:34:38,725 --> 00:34:42,405
Speaker 4:  I find I found a very, very useful in my experimenting and The

524
00:34:42,405 --> 00:34:45,525
Speaker 4:  Fresco app is probably the one that I found that had the best guided cooking

525
00:34:45,855 --> 00:34:46,525
Speaker 4:  experience.

526
00:34:51,795 --> 00:34:55,725
Speaker 4:  Okay, so that is the in-app timer on

527
00:34:55,825 --> 00:34:59,685
Speaker 4:  The. Fresco app is showing the step

528
00:34:59,745 --> 00:35:03,125
Speaker 4:  by step with the ingredients for each step, which is

529
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:07,485
Speaker 4:  key because you know when you're reading recipe and it says

530
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,725
Speaker 4:  add the flour and you're like, well how much flour was it? And then you scroll

531
00:35:10,725 --> 00:35:14,685
Speaker 4:  all the way back up and find the amount this has the amount with the ingredient

532
00:35:15,265 --> 00:35:19,125
Speaker 4:  and the step plus a little button for starting a timer for

533
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:23,005
Speaker 4:  the amount of time the recipe called for that step, which is

534
00:35:23,235 --> 00:35:27,085
Speaker 4:  kind of ingenious. And I'm surprised no one's done this before. So, so far

535
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:27,725
Speaker 4:  this is pretty good.

536
00:35:28,395 --> 00:35:31,885
Speaker 3:  What about the flip side? Is there a gadget that you are desperate to get

537
00:35:31,885 --> 00:35:35,725
Speaker 3:  rid of and stop having on your counter either because it's bad or because

538
00:35:35,755 --> 00:35:38,445
Speaker 3:  it's just been sort of useless to you in real life?

539
00:35:38,965 --> 00:35:42,765
Speaker 4:  I need to cut down on my counter clutter and at this stage what I would really

540
00:35:42,835 --> 00:35:46,645
Speaker 4:  like, and this is maybe a future bit too far in The future,

541
00:35:46,825 --> 00:35:50,725
Speaker 4:  but I want my oven to do everything that the

542
00:35:50,885 --> 00:35:53,885
Speaker 4:  Typhur and The Thermomix and the

543
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:58,485
Speaker 4:  Tovala and the Instapot does. I'm like, could there not be a way that

544
00:35:58,485 --> 00:36:01,645
Speaker 4:  these capabilities could all be in the biggest,

545
00:36:02,315 --> 00:36:04,565
Speaker 4:  most powerful, most expensive? Because

546
00:36:04,585 --> 00:36:07,685
Speaker 3:  As you have pointed out to me before, all these air fryers are just fancy

547
00:36:07,685 --> 00:36:10,445
Speaker 3:  convection ovens, which is a thing that your oven can theoretically do

548
00:36:11,395 --> 00:36:13,965
Speaker 3:  well. And actually to that point, one of the things I I meant to ask you

549
00:36:13,965 --> 00:36:17,605
Speaker 3:  about earlier is you and I have both had these years long obsessions with

550
00:36:17,605 --> 00:36:21,565
Speaker 3:  these allin one little ovens that are like the size of a toaster

551
00:36:21,565 --> 00:36:24,645
Speaker 3:  Oven, but are super smart. So they've had the ones that have the cameras

552
00:36:24,755 --> 00:36:27,125
Speaker 3:  that you put it in and it knows you're making chocolate chip cookies and

553
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:30,045
Speaker 3:  it'll just bake the chocolate chip cookies for you. That feels like magic

554
00:36:30,045 --> 00:36:33,685
Speaker 3:  to me, right? Like make that the size of my oven and that's

555
00:36:33,795 --> 00:36:36,765
Speaker 3:  what I want. I want to open it up, I wanna put it in and I wanna have the

556
00:36:36,765 --> 00:36:40,485
Speaker 3:  Oven know what to do. Yes. And that seems like

557
00:36:41,015 --> 00:36:44,925
Speaker 3:  where we should be headed. But you haven't once mentioned one of

558
00:36:44,925 --> 00:36:48,405
Speaker 3:  these little mini all in one smart ovens. No. And it does sort of feel like

559
00:36:48,445 --> 00:36:49,925
Speaker 3:  a dying thing.

560
00:36:50,635 --> 00:36:54,525
Speaker 4:  Literally. I mean the June is literally dead, which is very sad. That's

561
00:36:54,525 --> 00:36:55,765
Speaker 3:  Right. Just recently, right?

562
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:59,645
Speaker 4:  Just recently like unofficially confirmed that they're not gonna make

563
00:36:59,645 --> 00:37:03,565
Speaker 4:  another one and you can't buy one. And when I remodeled my kitchen, I didn't

564
00:37:03,565 --> 00:37:07,285
Speaker 4:  have the space, but my ideal had been to do built-ins and to

565
00:37:07,495 --> 00:37:11,405
Speaker 4:  build in two dune ovens. That was what? Oh, that's funny. But

566
00:37:11,405 --> 00:37:14,805
Speaker 4:  you can't do that. They're not June oven never made that capability. It has

567
00:37:14,805 --> 00:37:18,725
Speaker 4:  to be a Countertop oven. There is no smart builtin oven that I

568
00:37:18,725 --> 00:37:22,565
Speaker 4:  was able to buy when I remodeled my kitchen. I know Samsung now has one and

569
00:37:22,645 --> 00:37:26,445
Speaker 4:  I think there's actually this last week at the kitchen and bath

570
00:37:26,765 --> 00:37:29,445
Speaker 4:  industry show, I think there was quite a lot being shown off in this space.

571
00:37:29,905 --> 00:37:33,405
Speaker 4:  But those are also a level above price wise and

572
00:37:33,555 --> 00:37:37,365
Speaker 4:  feature wise. But yeah, I, that's, I could imagine, you know, a big

573
00:37:37,735 --> 00:37:41,685
Speaker 4:  range with like four compartments that could do all these different

574
00:37:41,685 --> 00:37:45,605
Speaker 4:  things, have these different functions. And also I want my stove top to,

575
00:37:45,665 --> 00:37:49,405
Speaker 4:  to be smart, I want my stove top to be able to tell me when the water's boiled

576
00:37:49,405 --> 00:37:53,365
Speaker 4:  over and turn itself off. And you know, there's so many features that

577
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:56,925
Speaker 4:  I feel like we could just put all into one big

578
00:37:57,035 --> 00:38:00,245
Speaker 4:  appliance in our kitchen and not have to have all of these small

579
00:38:00,495 --> 00:38:04,205
Speaker 4:  Countertop pieces as as much fun as they are and useful as they are. We just

580
00:38:04,205 --> 00:38:08,125
Speaker 4:  don't have the space for them. All the outlets. I run out of outlets very

581
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:08,405
Speaker 4:  quickly.

582
00:38:08,945 --> 00:38:12,805
Speaker 3:  Yes. Oh no, I, I absolutely feel that I have, I bought a milk frother

583
00:38:13,225 --> 00:38:16,605
Speaker 3:  and which is a ridiculous thing to own. And I pay for said

584
00:38:16,605 --> 00:38:19,645
Speaker 3:  ridiculousness every time I wanna use it because I have to unplug, unplug

585
00:38:19,645 --> 00:38:22,965
Speaker 3:  something some other appliance in order to plug in the milk frother. That

586
00:38:22,965 --> 00:38:23,085
Speaker 3:  is

587
00:38:23,525 --> 00:38:26,525
Speaker 4:  Actually the my favorite smart kitchen device that we haven't even talked

588
00:38:26,525 --> 00:38:30,445
Speaker 4:  about is my, I do have a smart coffee maker and that again, is a space that

589
00:38:30,445 --> 00:38:34,285
Speaker 4:  hasn't really taken off. There was one Bosch showed one off at CES this

590
00:38:34,285 --> 00:38:37,245
Speaker 4:  year that you could, could actually, the first time you could use voice control

591
00:38:37,265 --> 00:38:41,165
Speaker 4:  on a Countertop coffee maker. So you could say, Hey, Amazon's a

592
00:38:41,475 --> 00:38:45,445
Speaker 4:  make me an espresso. And you know, that is the dream. Yeah,

593
00:38:46,345 --> 00:38:49,765
Speaker 4:  you've been able to do it with the really, really expensive fancy built-in

594
00:38:49,765 --> 00:38:53,165
Speaker 4:  ones. But I have a GE profile little

595
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:58,045
Speaker 4:  espresso maker and it, it's smart in that I can customize my

596
00:38:58,265 --> 00:39:02,085
Speaker 4:  cup but I can't talk to it. And this would be a great device

597
00:39:02,105 --> 00:39:06,005
Speaker 4:  for our built-in voice assistant. I think one day, one day I can walk

598
00:39:06,005 --> 00:39:08,045
Speaker 4:  into the kitchen and just be like, geez, make me a coffee.

599
00:39:08,355 --> 00:39:12,165
Speaker 3:  It's the dream. And that is another one that is kind of a little

600
00:39:12,165 --> 00:39:15,365
Speaker 3:  tiny closed ecosystem. Yeah. And you could see how it would work. And I think

601
00:39:15,405 --> 00:39:19,125
Speaker 3:  I, I know a lot of folks who bought the very sort of simple timer coffee

602
00:39:19,365 --> 00:39:23,085
Speaker 3:  maker and it's like you put the beans in at night and you say at six 30 Yeah,

603
00:39:23,095 --> 00:39:26,125
Speaker 3:  broom me some coffee. And that is, that's a thing you can do and it actually

604
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:27,965
Speaker 3:  works pretty well and I think it's very cool. If, you

605
00:39:28,205 --> 00:39:29,525
Speaker 4:  Remember to set it well, right?

606
00:39:29,715 --> 00:39:32,645
Speaker 3:  It's, it's like turning your oven to remote control, right? You have to,

607
00:39:32,645 --> 00:39:36,165
Speaker 3:  you have to do that one bit of thing. But again, it's the same thing as meal

608
00:39:36,405 --> 00:39:39,365
Speaker 3:  planning. Jen, just that one added tiny bit of

609
00:39:39,715 --> 00:39:42,725
Speaker 3:  proactivity in my life and I would be a better, happier person. Well

610
00:39:42,725 --> 00:39:46,005
Speaker 4:  That, that really gets to the heart of my kind of overall takeaway here was

611
00:39:46,005 --> 00:39:49,605
Speaker 4:  that while I found that like the meal planning was easier and helped

612
00:39:49,905 --> 00:39:53,885
Speaker 4:  expand my repertoire and kind of it break me out the cooking route that

613
00:39:53,885 --> 00:39:57,525
Speaker 4:  you mentioned and you know, I spent a lot more time cooking

614
00:39:57,705 --> 00:40:01,485
Speaker 4:  and I, you know, I felt good about cooking for my family as opposed to buying

615
00:40:01,485 --> 00:40:05,245
Speaker 4:  pizza. I didn't feel it was sustainable though. Like when I went

616
00:40:05,265 --> 00:40:09,085
Speaker 4:  to the next weekend, so to sit down and meal

617
00:40:09,085 --> 00:40:10,925
Speaker 4:  plan again, I was like, whew, this is a lot of work.

618
00:40:12,465 --> 00:40:15,725
Speaker 4:  And then So, what I came down to at the end is that right now

619
00:40:16,545 --> 00:40:20,445
Speaker 4:  I'm the connective tissue of my smart kitchen. I'm the, the diff i I'm

620
00:40:20,445 --> 00:40:23,365
Speaker 4:  the connection between the apps, the voice control, the appliances, the grocery

621
00:40:23,415 --> 00:40:27,205
Speaker 4:  store. I need something to come in and, and help

622
00:40:27,315 --> 00:40:31,125
Speaker 4:  fill some of those roles. You know, ultimately, you know, the Rosie the

623
00:40:31,135 --> 00:40:35,125
Speaker 4:  robot, I know we're a few years away from that or the robotic arms to do

624
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:38,925
Speaker 4:  some of the work. But I also feel like, and this is something that Ben and

625
00:40:38,925 --> 00:40:42,845
Speaker 4:  Nick talked to a bit in our last interview with them, is that this is probably

626
00:40:42,845 --> 00:40:46,685
Speaker 4:  where generative AI is really gonna come in and kind of move the needle

627
00:40:46,785 --> 00:40:50,605
Speaker 4:  on the smart kitchen in terms of helping pull all those pieces and parts

628
00:40:50,805 --> 00:40:54,485
Speaker 4:  together and taking some of that mental load away from you. And then combined

629
00:40:54,515 --> 00:40:58,365
Speaker 4:  with the interoperability, we're beginning to see between appliances

630
00:40:58,365 --> 00:41:02,085
Speaker 4:  with the home connectivity alliance matter and what Fresco's doing with

631
00:41:02,185 --> 00:41:05,325
Speaker 4:  its app. And I know I say this all the time, but we are so close.

632
00:41:06,135 --> 00:41:09,005
Speaker 3:  Don't say matter, Chad, don't do it. Don't do it.

633
00:41:10,065 --> 00:41:12,725
Speaker 4:  We are close. Oh, we're close. We're, we're a lot closer than we were 10

634
00:41:12,725 --> 00:41:16,605
Speaker 4:  years ago. I just feel like we didn't take as much, there hasn't been as

635
00:41:16,605 --> 00:41:20,525
Speaker 4:  much movement in the last decade as I had genuinely

636
00:41:20,535 --> 00:41:24,165
Speaker 4:  hoped there would be. I put off redoing my smart kitchen, my kitchen

637
00:41:24,345 --> 00:41:26,005
Speaker 4:  as long as I possibly could.

638
00:41:27,145 --> 00:41:29,205
Speaker 3:  Is there anything that came outta this that you learned that you're like,

639
00:41:29,205 --> 00:41:32,965
Speaker 3:  okay, I will actually pull this back into my real life as a real

640
00:41:33,005 --> 00:41:34,045
Speaker 3:  person? Yeah,

641
00:41:34,165 --> 00:41:38,005
Speaker 4:  I, I do think I will keep, I will keep using the The Samsung Food

642
00:41:38,105 --> 00:41:42,085
Speaker 4:  app. I did actually find that useful and I actually used my

643
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:45,965
Speaker 4:  smart fridges screen much more in the last week than I have in the

644
00:41:45,965 --> 00:41:49,885
Speaker 4:  entire five years that I've had it. Okay. So using the

645
00:41:49,905 --> 00:41:53,365
Speaker 4:  screen here on my fridge has actually been very

646
00:41:53,855 --> 00:41:57,565
Speaker 4:  handy for cooking this recipe. I can see the entirety

647
00:41:57,785 --> 00:42:01,725
Speaker 4:  of the ingredients on one screen and it stays on

648
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:05,685
Speaker 4:  unlike my phone or iPad, which keeps locking itself. So, I have to keep

649
00:42:05,965 --> 00:42:09,365
Speaker 4:  pressing, putting my code in or trying to get my face in the right angle.

650
00:42:09,885 --> 00:42:13,805
Speaker 4:  I will, my next recipe, I'm gonna try one of the smart displays because

651
00:42:14,225 --> 00:42:18,085
Speaker 4:  for memory those will stay fixed while you're following a

652
00:42:18,085 --> 00:42:21,965
Speaker 4:  recipe and they can call out the steps to you. Whereas for the fridge

653
00:42:22,085 --> 00:42:25,805
Speaker 4:  I had to keep coming back and checking. But it worked pretty well. It

654
00:42:25,865 --> 00:42:29,645
Speaker 4:  was useful on that big screen. And it does make me think, and this is

655
00:42:29,645 --> 00:42:33,485
Speaker 4:  something that Ben discussed last week, that ultimately we do need a

656
00:42:33,485 --> 00:42:37,445
Speaker 4:  central kitchen interface. Maybe that's one of those things that

657
00:42:37,445 --> 00:42:41,165
Speaker 4:  could replace the, the connective tissue that I mentioned about a,

658
00:42:41,365 --> 00:42:45,005
Speaker 4:  a, a central sort of dashboard for your smart kitchen. Once we have the

659
00:42:45,005 --> 00:42:48,925
Speaker 4:  interoperability and once we have maybe some, the generative AI

660
00:42:48,925 --> 00:42:52,765
Speaker 4:  being able to help with a lot of these tasks, having one central dashboard

661
00:42:52,815 --> 00:42:56,765
Speaker 4:  where you can control all of your appliances. Read your recipes. Yes.

662
00:42:56,765 --> 00:43:00,445
Speaker 4:  What watch TikTok when you're waiting for that timer to finish. I do feel

663
00:43:00,445 --> 00:43:03,325
Speaker 4:  like that is something we are, we are gonna need. I felt like we moved away

664
00:43:03,325 --> 00:43:07,285
Speaker 4:  from it because everyone was like, this is a bad idea but

665
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:09,725
Speaker 4:  I don't see another solution yet. So

666
00:43:10,145 --> 00:43:14,005
Speaker 3:  Here's my question about that though is, is that a screen

667
00:43:14,015 --> 00:43:17,285
Speaker 3:  built into one of your appliances and in that case I think the fridge is

668
00:43:17,285 --> 00:43:20,605
Speaker 3:  very natural, right? Like one thing you and I agree on is that the TV as

669
00:43:20,605 --> 00:43:23,565
Speaker 3:  a center of a smart home is a really interesting, powerful thing because

670
00:43:23,565 --> 00:43:27,485
Speaker 3:  it's this giant screen in the middle of your home that can

671
00:43:27,485 --> 00:43:31,245
Speaker 3:  do a lot of stuff and I think the kitchen, that's the fridge, right? That

672
00:43:31,245 --> 00:43:34,205
Speaker 3:  is the thing. It is, it is always within arms reach as you're in the kitchen.

673
00:43:34,205 --> 00:43:37,925
Speaker 3:  Unless you have a weird kitchen, it's just huge. It's right there. It makes

674
00:43:37,925 --> 00:43:41,245
Speaker 3:  a lot of sense that the fridge would be the thing. And yet I wanna upgrade

675
00:43:41,245 --> 00:43:44,765
Speaker 3:  most of my screens a lot more often than I wanna upgrade my kitchen. So my

676
00:43:44,925 --> 00:43:48,805
Speaker 3:  question is, is that some appliance maker who will build that thing or

677
00:43:48,865 --> 00:43:52,605
Speaker 3:  is that an iPad or a Pixel tablet? I mean Google made the pixel

678
00:43:52,605 --> 00:43:56,405
Speaker 3:  tablet like pretty clearly as a smart home thing and you just reviewed

679
00:43:56,405 --> 00:43:59,925
Speaker 3:  Amazon's Echo hub, which is very much after the same thing. Like is this

680
00:44:00,005 --> 00:44:03,685
Speaker 3:  a whole category of device that a kitchen maker

681
00:44:03,685 --> 00:44:06,805
Speaker 3:  needs to figure out? Or is this just a tablet that understands my kitchen?

682
00:44:07,235 --> 00:44:11,005
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I, I actually, when I was reviewing the Echo Hub, I did try and put

683
00:44:11,005 --> 00:44:14,245
Speaker 4:  it on the wall in my kitchen because it did feel like it would be a, a great

684
00:44:14,245 --> 00:44:15,405
Speaker 4:  device to have in the kitchen.

685
00:44:15,405 --> 00:44:18,005
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Stick a magnet on that thing. Yeah, put it right on the fridge. I love

686
00:44:18,005 --> 00:44:18,485
Speaker 3:  it. So

687
00:44:18,795 --> 00:44:21,885
Speaker 4:  Samsung's in a unique position because it's an electronics company and an

688
00:44:21,885 --> 00:44:25,765
Speaker 4:  appliance manufacturer. So it kind of had it, it was in a good position

689
00:44:25,765 --> 00:44:29,165
Speaker 4:  to do this and they've done a good job with it and they've iterated.

690
00:44:29,545 --> 00:44:33,285
Speaker 4:  But I agree that the idea of having

691
00:44:33,825 --> 00:44:37,125
Speaker 4:  one screen that you rely on to run your entire kitchen in your appliance

692
00:44:37,305 --> 00:44:40,925
Speaker 4:  is kind of a scary one. But on the flip side would be

693
00:44:41,015 --> 00:44:44,685
Speaker 4:  small screens in every appliance, which is actually what Samsung's doing

694
00:44:44,685 --> 00:44:48,605
Speaker 4:  and they showed at CES and that that those screens all communicate with each

695
00:44:48,605 --> 00:44:52,485
Speaker 4:  other. So you're not dealing with a nude interface every time you

696
00:44:52,485 --> 00:44:56,045
Speaker 4:  move around the kitchen. So you can, but you do have to have all smart things

697
00:44:56,055 --> 00:44:58,005
Speaker 4:  appliances or or Samsung appliances.

698
00:44:58,125 --> 00:45:00,885
Speaker 3:  I kind of hate that outcome. Yeah. I'm not gonna lie. Yeah. This idea of

699
00:45:00,885 --> 00:45:04,645
Speaker 3:  everything has its own little screen and touch universe is not what I'm after.

700
00:45:05,085 --> 00:45:08,445
Speaker 4:  I don't know that an iPad is a solution either I don't, you know,

701
00:45:08,555 --> 00:45:10,805
Speaker 4:  something that's portable is gonna walk out of the kitchen,

702
00:45:11,655 --> 00:45:14,365
Speaker 3:  Right, true. Or it's battery dies or whatever.

703
00:45:14,395 --> 00:45:17,765
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think something that is permanently in the kitchen

704
00:45:18,305 --> 00:45:22,205
Speaker 4:  but that is upgradable and swappable is where we will probably get

705
00:45:22,205 --> 00:45:25,605
Speaker 4:  to rather than it being in appliances. Because once you have interoperability

706
00:45:25,795 --> 00:45:29,605
Speaker 4:  once matter and the Home Connectivity Alliance brings everything

707
00:45:29,635 --> 00:45:32,965
Speaker 4:  hopefully to a point where all your appliances can talk to each other,

708
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:37,085
Speaker 4:  then you don't need a proprietary tablet in your fridge. You can

709
00:45:37,185 --> 00:45:41,085
Speaker 4:  use any device and I think we might start to see people kind of fill this

710
00:45:41,085 --> 00:45:44,845
Speaker 4:  niche and come up with dedicated sort of kitchen smart home

711
00:45:44,925 --> 00:45:48,845
Speaker 4:  control panels. And that's what I felt like I needed actually this this

712
00:45:48,845 --> 00:45:52,445
Speaker 4:  last week was just that extra interface where everything, all,

713
00:45:52,495 --> 00:45:55,845
Speaker 4:  everything was worked together in one space and I didn't have to kind of

714
00:45:55,845 --> 00:45:58,285
Speaker 4:  run around and deal with lots of different appliances.

715
00:45:58,475 --> 00:46:02,445
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And especially if I can have that thing without worrying about

716
00:46:02,445 --> 00:46:06,405
Speaker 3:  getting flour and olive oil all over my very expensive iPad.

717
00:46:07,385 --> 00:46:10,885
Speaker 3:  Now we're now we're talking, I'm into that. What about the software side

718
00:46:10,885 --> 00:46:13,485
Speaker 3:  of this before we go, we should talk about this. You mentioned, so Samsung

719
00:46:13,635 --> 00:46:17,125
Speaker 3:  food as an app that you have used and liked. I think one of the

720
00:46:17,405 --> 00:46:20,885
Speaker 3:  challenges of the Smart Kitchen is that it demands, you have a

721
00:46:21,475 --> 00:46:25,005
Speaker 3:  home screen full of apps to control all of your individual things.

722
00:46:25,905 --> 00:46:29,805
Speaker 3:  But did you find anything that A, either does a good job of putting

723
00:46:29,805 --> 00:46:33,405
Speaker 3:  that stuff together or B just feels like awesome smart Kitchen

724
00:46:33,685 --> 00:46:34,645
Speaker 3:  software that everybody should know about?

725
00:46:35,065 --> 00:46:38,805
Speaker 4:  So this, I did enjoy The Samsung Food app. I did not enjoy the ads. Lots

726
00:46:38,805 --> 00:46:42,325
Speaker 4:  of ads you can pay to get rid of them. I do feel like the

727
00:46:42,485 --> 00:46:46,365
Speaker 4:  Fresco's Kitchen os is probably our best experience I had and

728
00:46:46,365 --> 00:46:49,605
Speaker 4:  I had two experiences with that one. We talked about the guided recipe, which

729
00:46:49,605 --> 00:46:53,445
Speaker 4:  was, which was really useful. And that works with any recipe that

730
00:46:53,505 --> 00:46:56,565
Speaker 4:  it, that you can import into The Fresco app and then it sort of strips it

731
00:46:56,565 --> 00:46:59,885
Speaker 4:  and does the whole process of turning it into a guided recipe for you,

732
00:47:00,415 --> 00:47:04,165
Speaker 4:  which was useful. But what Fresco does with its kitchen

733
00:47:04,385 --> 00:47:07,765
Speaker 4:  os is it uses its interface in appliance

734
00:47:07,835 --> 00:47:11,765
Speaker 4:  manufacturers apps. And in my two to

735
00:47:11,765 --> 00:47:14,885
Speaker 4:  five years of testing smart kitchen appliances, I have yet to come across

736
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:18,765
Speaker 4:  a Smart Appliance kitchen, a smart kitchen appliances app

737
00:47:18,915 --> 00:47:22,565
Speaker 4:  that is any good. They are all useless,

738
00:47:23,275 --> 00:47:27,245
Speaker 4:  they're badly laid out, they don't have good interfaces, they're

739
00:47:27,245 --> 00:47:31,205
Speaker 4:  hard to understand. And so what Fresco's doing with its kitchen os is trying

740
00:47:31,205 --> 00:47:35,085
Speaker 4:  to make that a uniform experience no matter what device

741
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:39,005
Speaker 4:  you're using. It uses the same interface. And that's a huge

742
00:47:39,035 --> 00:47:42,965
Speaker 4:  step forward I think in the smart kitchen because as it is, most of our

743
00:47:42,965 --> 00:47:46,445
Speaker 4:  appliances have confusing interfaces. Like I still haven't figured out how

744
00:47:46,445 --> 00:47:50,205
Speaker 4:  to use 80% of what my microwave can do because I don't know, I,

745
00:47:50,385 --> 00:47:54,005
Speaker 4:  the the touch panel, it's not touch panel. It's, it's a beep beep beep panel

746
00:47:54,505 --> 00:47:58,485
Speaker 4:  and it's not intuitive. So yeah, I I really, I was impressed.

747
00:47:58,605 --> 00:48:01,805
Speaker 4:  I used the Kitchen os interface in the Instapot app

748
00:48:02,425 --> 00:48:06,045
Speaker 4:  and it was, it was, it definitely gave me a feeling of like, okay,

749
00:48:06,315 --> 00:48:10,245
Speaker 4:  someone has solved this, let's just hope more manufacturers

750
00:48:10,245 --> 00:48:14,205
Speaker 4:  will use this and put it into their apps rather than trying to come

751
00:48:14,205 --> 00:48:17,725
Speaker 4:  up and reinvent the wheel every time. Because that's where we end up with

752
00:48:17,915 --> 00:48:20,965
Speaker 4:  it's complicated and confusing and I just don't wanna use an app anymore.

753
00:48:21,805 --> 00:48:25,645
Speaker 4:  I just gonna go press the button on the device and probably set it

754
00:48:25,645 --> 00:48:26,685
Speaker 4:  wrong and burn my toast.

755
00:48:26,995 --> 00:48:30,965
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I I, I like the idea of thinking about how do we make

756
00:48:30,965 --> 00:48:34,765
Speaker 3:  it so that you are less the connective tissue of the smart kitchen

757
00:48:34,765 --> 00:48:38,485
Speaker 3:  because the individual things are getting smarter and I think, I mean this

758
00:48:38,485 --> 00:48:41,525
Speaker 3:  is why I'm, I'm glad we had Ben on last week to talk about kind of what it

759
00:48:41,525 --> 00:48:45,045
Speaker 3:  means to unify all this stuff across systems and

760
00:48:45,315 --> 00:48:48,965
Speaker 3:  they're very bullish on AI as the solution and we'll see about that.

761
00:48:49,205 --> 00:48:51,885
Speaker 3:  I have a lot of feelings about generative AI as the solution to everything,

762
00:48:52,265 --> 00:48:56,005
Speaker 3:  but yeah, I, I have really come to believe that relying on appliance

763
00:48:56,005 --> 00:48:59,605
Speaker 3:  manufacturers to build great software is just not going to work. Nope. And

764
00:48:59,605 --> 00:49:03,005
Speaker 3:  that's okay. Their job is not to build great software. Their job is to build

765
00:49:03,075 --> 00:49:06,885
Speaker 3:  washing machines Yes. And blenders and that's good

766
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:10,925
Speaker 3:  and fine. Yes. And what we need is the layer that comes in and

767
00:49:10,925 --> 00:49:14,645
Speaker 3:  I feel like we've spent the last decade getting a lot of versions of that

768
00:49:14,775 --> 00:49:18,485
Speaker 3:  layer that haven't really worked. And whether it's Matter or Kitchen

769
00:49:18,665 --> 00:49:22,645
Speaker 3:  os or something else, it does feel like everyone at least knows

770
00:49:23,145 --> 00:49:27,005
Speaker 3:  that's the thing now. And that's where we unlock a lot of what

771
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:28,165
Speaker 3:  comes next in the Smart kitchen

772
00:49:28,945 --> 00:49:32,845
Speaker 4:  For sure. We just need to bring it all together and the Smart Fridge needs

773
00:49:32,845 --> 00:49:36,205
Speaker 4:  to move beyond just Samsung too. Like they've done a great job here.

774
00:49:36,705 --> 00:49:40,605
Speaker 4:  It didn't start out well, but it's getting better and you

775
00:49:40,605 --> 00:49:44,365
Speaker 4:  got, you know, they've persevered. LG just kind of stopped

776
00:49:44,595 --> 00:49:48,125
Speaker 4:  with smart fridges and Well, cool. And GE,

777
00:49:48,725 --> 00:49:52,205
Speaker 4:  I you know, we, I just haven't seen much innovation in this sort of smart

778
00:49:52,205 --> 00:49:55,685
Speaker 4:  kitchen space for cooking. And there's been a lot of innovation in technology,

779
00:49:55,755 --> 00:49:59,485
Speaker 4:  just not in making it a seamless experience the way

780
00:49:59,485 --> 00:50:03,085
Speaker 4:  we've been talking about it. And, you know, we need a fridge that can tell

781
00:50:03,085 --> 00:50:06,965
Speaker 4:  us what food we have and what's gonna exp when it's gonna expire, what you

782
00:50:06,965 --> 00:50:10,405
Speaker 4:  need to buy. Because, you know, that doesn't, that's not just about convenience,

783
00:50:10,405 --> 00:50:14,125
Speaker 4:  but it solves a huge issue around food waste. And as we talked about healthy

784
00:50:14,145 --> 00:50:18,125
Speaker 4:  eating, there's just so, there's so much potential there. And I

785
00:50:18,125 --> 00:50:21,205
Speaker 4:  just feel like the other appliance manufacturers do kind of need to step

786
00:50:21,205 --> 00:50:23,965
Speaker 4:  up here. 'cause not everyone's gonna buy the Samsung Smart Fridge.

787
00:50:24,795 --> 00:50:28,685
Speaker 3:  Yeah. We, we talk a lot on this show about like the increasingly boring

788
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:32,485
Speaker 3:  state of smartphones. Like phones are becoming appliances. Like let's,

789
00:50:32,485 --> 00:50:35,525
Speaker 3:  let's make appliances, gadgets again. you know what I mean? Yes.

790
00:50:36,015 --> 00:50:37,085
Speaker 4:  Let's, I like it.

791
00:50:37,605 --> 00:50:41,405
Speaker 3:  I want Tim Cook to be on stage in three years being like, we've done it,

792
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:44,925
Speaker 3:  we've made the Apple Fridge. And everybody's like, oh my God. Like, that's,

793
00:50:44,925 --> 00:50:48,885
Speaker 3:  that's what we're going for. Jen. These are the rules. All right.

794
00:50:48,905 --> 00:50:52,285
Speaker 3:  We gotta get outta here. Jen, this has been a pleasure. Thank you for going

795
00:50:52,285 --> 00:50:56,125
Speaker 3:  through this insane process for our pleasure. I

796
00:50:56,245 --> 00:50:58,005
Speaker 3:  I, I apologize to you and your family.

797
00:50:58,345 --> 00:51:00,445
Speaker 4:  Oh, they loved it. They got to eat all the food.

798
00:51:01,075 --> 00:51:04,965
Speaker 3:  They got ramen, they got pork belly every, everybody wins. Alright,
