00:00:02,635 --> 00:00:03,125
Speaker 2:  Welcome

3
00:00:03,125 --> 00:00:06,925
Speaker 3:  To, The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of really, really old computers.

4
00:00:07,185 --> 00:00:10,605
Speaker 3:  I'm your friend David Pierce, and I am currently sitting in my car

5
00:00:10,985 --> 00:00:14,445
Speaker 3:  out front of my house. I've developed this morning routine over the last

6
00:00:14,445 --> 00:00:18,405
Speaker 3:  few weeks when it's been like bitterly cold and snowy and icy on

7
00:00:18,405 --> 00:00:22,245
Speaker 3:  the east coast of the US where I live. Where instead of coming out and

8
00:00:22,495 --> 00:00:26,165
Speaker 3:  being a proactive person who, you know, scrapes off my windshield and

9
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:29,365
Speaker 3:  dusts off all the snow and gets everything ready and just gets going for

10
00:00:29,365 --> 00:00:33,245
Speaker 3:  the day, I instead come out, turn on the car, put all the

11
00:00:33,245 --> 00:00:36,925
Speaker 3:  heat up to full blast, and then just sit here for like 15 minutes

12
00:00:37,095 --> 00:00:40,765
Speaker 3:  until everything you know, melts and goes away on its own.

13
00:00:40,985 --> 00:00:44,645
Speaker 3:  And then I'm safe to drive while I'm waiting. I listen to podcasts,

14
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:48,725
Speaker 3:  I drink coffee, I catch up on email. I like to convince myself

15
00:00:48,725 --> 00:00:52,285
Speaker 3:  that this is like a meditative thing I do to really get ready for the day

16
00:00:52,705 --> 00:00:56,245
Speaker 3:  and not just a thing that I do because I'm too lazy and too

17
00:00:56,965 --> 00:01:00,805
Speaker 3:  annoying about my hands being cold, to actually just get outta the car and

18
00:01:00,805 --> 00:01:04,685
Speaker 3:  get it ready. Listen, it's not a great strategy, but it's working for

19
00:01:04,685 --> 00:01:08,485
Speaker 3:  me and hopefully it's not gonna be this cold much longer, so I'm going with

20
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:12,365
Speaker 3:  it. Anyway, we have an awesome show coming up for you. today we're gonna

21
00:01:12,365 --> 00:01:16,165
Speaker 3:  talk about the 40th anniversary of the original Macintosh,

22
00:01:16,165 --> 00:01:19,885
Speaker 3:  which launched this week in 1984. We're gonna talk to Walt Mossberg,

23
00:01:19,945 --> 00:01:23,685
Speaker 3:  who has all the stories you could possibly imagine about that computer and

24
00:01:23,685 --> 00:01:27,605
Speaker 3:  what happened in the interim 40 years. Then we're gonna talk to Ali Abdaal,

25
00:01:27,665 --> 00:01:31,125
Speaker 3:  who is an influencer and creator and YouTuber that you might have heard of

26
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:35,085
Speaker 3:  about a book he wrote about what it means to be a productive person

27
00:01:35,385 --> 00:01:38,965
Speaker 3:  in the world. We're right at the time of the year where everybody bails on

28
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:42,165
Speaker 3:  their New Year's resolutions, and I thought it would be a fun time to talk

29
00:01:42,165 --> 00:01:46,005
Speaker 3:  about how to do better and whether specifically all of the

30
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:49,485
Speaker 3:  digital tools we have can help us do better. All of that is coming up in

31
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:53,445
Speaker 3:  just a second, but first I think the snow is finally going.

32
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:56,685
Speaker 3:  So I have to run to the store and then we're gonna get to it. This is the

33
00:01:56,805 --> 00:01:57,845
Speaker 3:  Vergecast. See you in a sec.

34
00:03:12,785 --> 00:03:16,635
Speaker 3:  Welcome back, I'm defrosted cars defrosted. Let's do some Verge

35
00:03:16,635 --> 00:03:20,355
Speaker 3:  casting. But real quick before we get started, we're working on an upcoming

36
00:03:20,355 --> 00:03:24,235
Speaker 3:  segment about Boss Ware, which is the software that employers use to

37
00:03:24,235 --> 00:03:27,875
Speaker 3:  monitor and evaluate their employees. That software is getting more powerful

38
00:03:28,055 --> 00:03:31,715
Speaker 3:  and more invasive all the time. You have software suites that are logging

39
00:03:31,765 --> 00:03:35,635
Speaker 3:  keystrokes and taking screenshots. They're calculating active and

40
00:03:35,635 --> 00:03:39,035
Speaker 3:  inactive time and they can even spy on you with your devices

41
00:03:39,215 --> 00:03:42,795
Speaker 3:  webcam. We're looking for people with firsthand experience with ware,

42
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:46,875
Speaker 3:  so if that's you get in touch. We wanna know how you're being tracked and

43
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:50,675
Speaker 3:  how it affects your day-to-Day work life. Also, we wanna know all of the

44
00:03:50,675 --> 00:03:53,955
Speaker 3:  ways you've found to creatively, let's say work around

45
00:03:54,595 --> 00:03:58,275
Speaker 3:  ware. We want to hear all your tips and tricks. You can email Vergecast at

46
00:03:58,275 --> 00:04:01,915
Speaker 3:  The Verge dot com or call the Hotline eight six six Verge one one.

47
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:05,395
Speaker 3:  We'll keep you anonymous if you want, but we want to hear all of your stories.

48
00:04:05,905 --> 00:04:09,875
Speaker 3:  Alright, today, first up, 40 years ago this week, in fact 40 years

49
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,435
Speaker 3:  ago today, if you're listening to this, on Wednesday, January 24th,

50
00:04:13,805 --> 00:04:17,715
Speaker 3:  apple launched the original Macintosh. It was a big deal in

51
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:21,595
Speaker 3:  part because Apple launched it alongside one of the most epic ads of all

52
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:25,315
Speaker 3:  time. Do you remember the one with the woman hurling the hammer at the big

53
00:04:25,315 --> 00:04:28,515
Speaker 3:  screen shattering it, and then you have the message about Big Brother. In

54
00:04:28,755 --> 00:04:29,235
Speaker 3:  1984,

55
00:04:29,975 --> 00:04:33,435
Speaker 7:  On January 24th, apple computer will introduce

56
00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:37,275
Speaker 7:  Macintosh and you'll see why 1984

57
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:40,075
Speaker 7:  won't be like 1984.

58
00:04:40,605 --> 00:04:44,235
Speaker 3:  Apple hyped this thing up in a big way, and as it turns out,

59
00:04:44,595 --> 00:04:47,955
Speaker 3:  deservedly so. Here's Steve Jobs introducing the Macintosh at a meeting of

60
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,475
Speaker 3:  the Boston Computer Society.

61
00:04:50,065 --> 00:04:54,035
Speaker 8:  What we need now is the third industry milestone product,

62
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:58,395
Speaker 8:  and that's what Macintosh is all about. We've been working on this thing

63
00:04:58,415 --> 00:05:01,875
Speaker 8:  for over two years now, and those of us that have been really close to it,

64
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:05,755
Speaker 8:  we'll all tell you it is insanely great and you'll have a

65
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:07,635
Speaker 8:  chance to see a little bit more of it later on tonight.

66
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,395
Speaker 3:  You can find that whole launch on YouTube. By the way, I'll put the link

67
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:15,235
Speaker 3:  in the show notes. It's great, super fun to watch 40 years later and

68
00:05:15,235 --> 00:05:18,795
Speaker 3:  40 years later, I think it's safe to say Jobs was mostly right,

69
00:05:19,175 --> 00:05:22,595
Speaker 3:  the Macintosh was a game changer, and its legacy is actually

70
00:05:22,595 --> 00:05:26,555
Speaker 3:  everywhere in the computers that we use now. So we figured on this

71
00:05:26,555 --> 00:05:30,075
Speaker 3:  anniversary, we'd go back in history a bit and talk about what the

72
00:05:30,075 --> 00:05:33,795
Speaker 3:  Macintosh meant 40 years ago and what it means now and

73
00:05:34,055 --> 00:05:37,355
Speaker 3:  who better to do it with than Walt Mossberg, former Verge executive editor,

74
00:05:37,475 --> 00:05:41,315
Speaker 3:  longtime Wall Street, Journal tech columnist, and probably the person

75
00:05:41,345 --> 00:05:44,795
Speaker 3:  with the most impressive gadget collection you'll ever see anywhere.

76
00:05:45,265 --> 00:05:47,875
Speaker 3:  Walt, Mossberg, Welcome, back to The. Vergecast. Always

77
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:48,835
Speaker 5:  Love to be here, David.

78
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:53,075
Speaker 3:  We're happy to have you. So our occasion this time is the 40th anniversary

79
00:05:53,135 --> 00:05:56,435
Speaker 3:  of the Macintosh, and one of the reasons I'm very excited to talk to you

80
00:05:56,435 --> 00:05:59,725
Speaker 3:  about it is obviously you've sort of seen this thing through its whole history,

81
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:03,925
Speaker 3:  but also the Macintosh came out, if I'm doing my math correctly,

82
00:06:04,505 --> 00:06:07,765
Speaker 3:  six or seven years before you became a tech columnist.

83
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:08,445
Speaker 9:  That's right.

84
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:12,005
Speaker 3:  You were a computer hobbyist at the time, so it's not like you were not aware

85
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:15,805
Speaker 3:  of the Macintosh in 1984. Right. What was your experience of that launch

86
00:06:15,805 --> 00:06:16,085
Speaker 3:  then?

87
00:06:16,555 --> 00:06:19,805
Speaker 9:  Well, I was, I was a crazed computer hobbyist,

88
00:06:20,385 --> 00:06:24,285
Speaker 9:  and it was really all, all I did outside of work. You know, at

89
00:06:24,285 --> 00:06:27,965
Speaker 9:  the time I was covering Washington for the Wall Street Journal, Washington

90
00:06:27,965 --> 00:06:31,765
Speaker 9:  Bureau. So my first encounter with the Mac was as a

91
00:06:32,205 --> 00:06:36,165
Speaker 9:  customer, but it was little confusing. I mean, I bought a Mac,

92
00:06:36,745 --> 00:06:40,685
Speaker 9:  not the first one, either the second or the third one, and I can't

93
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:44,845
Speaker 9:  remember, I loved it like any bleeding

94
00:06:44,915 --> 00:06:48,445
Speaker 9:  edge person, I thought it was genius, partly because

95
00:06:49,105 --> 00:06:52,605
Speaker 9:  it shipped with capabilities that on an Apple

96
00:06:52,905 --> 00:06:56,565
Speaker 9:  two or a Wintel pc you had to buy cards

97
00:06:56,785 --> 00:07:00,605
Speaker 9:  and put them in to get these things and the Mac had not every

98
00:07:00,665 --> 00:07:04,565
Speaker 9:  one of them. Like, I don't think it had a modem, but it, it

99
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:08,285
Speaker 9:  had sound. That was really good sound. It had

100
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:09,885
Speaker 9:  a bunch of other stuff.

101
00:07:10,745 --> 00:07:14,445
Speaker 3:  The thing about the Mac, I was, I was going back and trying to think, okay,

102
00:07:14,445 --> 00:07:18,125
Speaker 3:  like we sort of understand the legacy of it now as

103
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:22,365
Speaker 3:  it was the first computer that, you know, to use an Apple

104
00:07:22,505 --> 00:07:25,525
Speaker 3:  is just worked, right? It was the first thing you could sort of sit down

105
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,645
Speaker 3:  and intuitively use, which computers had just not been before.

106
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:30,365
Speaker 9:  Well, that's

107
00:07:30,365 --> 00:07:33,765
Speaker 3:  Right. But I'm particularly curious for your perspective in 1984,

108
00:07:34,265 --> 00:07:37,445
Speaker 3:  did it feel like that? Because part of me thinks about a lot of what we do

109
00:07:37,445 --> 00:07:41,245
Speaker 3:  with new technology is unlearn old bad habits and it actually

110
00:07:41,255 --> 00:07:44,325
Speaker 3:  feels bad. Like this thing we're doing with Google search right now, right?

111
00:07:44,325 --> 00:07:47,805
Speaker 3:  Where we all learned how to sort of type the keywords to get what we wanted

112
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:51,965
Speaker 3:  and now it's like, oh, we have these better tools, just ask a question like

113
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:55,605
Speaker 3:  a person. And that actually feels strange, even that it's an objectively

114
00:07:55,605 --> 00:07:58,685
Speaker 3:  better behavior. But I wonder coming from something like an Apple two E,

115
00:07:58,685 --> 00:08:01,085
Speaker 3:  which you would learn how to use and get very good at, and it's like learning

116
00:08:01,085 --> 00:08:04,445
Speaker 3:  an instrument coming to a Macintosh, even if it is sort of better,

117
00:08:04,755 --> 00:08:08,605
Speaker 3:  there's gotta be a weird phase of like, what do you mean I click

118
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,525
Speaker 3:  on this icon to open the thing?

119
00:08:10,985 --> 00:08:14,925
Speaker 9:  The weird phase for me maybe lasted 48 hours.

120
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:18,805
Speaker 9:  Okay. It was very easy to make the transition and the reason

121
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:22,845
Speaker 9:  was, although I was very proficient in Apple

122
00:08:23,195 --> 00:08:27,045
Speaker 9:  Doss or whatever the, I think pro doss, whatever they

123
00:08:27,045 --> 00:08:30,925
Speaker 9:  called it, it was Doss, it was like Doss from Microsoft or

124
00:08:31,055 --> 00:08:35,045
Speaker 9:  using Lotus 1, 2, 3. I mean, you had to learn a ton of commands

125
00:08:35,045 --> 00:08:38,405
Speaker 9:  and syntax and if you got, if you mistyped one letter,

126
00:08:38,905 --> 00:08:40,165
Speaker 9:  you were screwed. I

127
00:08:40,165 --> 00:08:42,645
Speaker 3:  Mean, you were writing code in a, in a very real way on it. You

128
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:46,285
Speaker 9:  Were. And you know, I became proficient at that, but

129
00:08:46,555 --> 00:08:50,205
Speaker 9:  even before I started my column, which was in

130
00:08:50,445 --> 00:08:54,325
Speaker 9:  1991, and which was all dedicated to

131
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:58,205
Speaker 9:  the proposition that computers were too hard to use and everything had to

132
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:02,045
Speaker 9:  get easier even before that, that's how I felt. In fact, that

133
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:06,125
Speaker 9:  bled into my decision to try to convince, successfully

134
00:09:06,405 --> 00:09:09,725
Speaker 9:  convince the Wall Street Journal, let me do a computer column. Well,

135
00:09:09,725 --> 00:09:12,765
Speaker 3:  And even in that first column, if I remember correctly, you mentioned the

136
00:09:13,005 --> 00:09:16,525
Speaker 3:  Macintosh as an example of kind of how to do this better.

137
00:09:17,205 --> 00:09:20,965
Speaker 9:  I don't remember that, but it's possible. I will tell you that in one of

138
00:09:20,985 --> 00:09:24,965
Speaker 9:  my many, many meetings with Bill Gates, he said to

139
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:28,125
Speaker 9:  me, this is some years later, he said to me,

140
00:09:28,645 --> 00:09:32,165
Speaker 9:  Mossberg, why don't you just headline every one of your columns by a Mac?

141
00:09:34,165 --> 00:09:38,125
Speaker 9:  I swear to God and with Steve Jobs, whatever I

142
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:41,965
Speaker 9:  said about the Mac, even if it was, you know, a rave review in my

143
00:09:41,965 --> 00:09:45,765
Speaker 9:  eyes, it was never good enough for him. Sure. Because I would point out some

144
00:09:46,205 --> 00:09:49,965
Speaker 9:  downside of it or whatever, even if I said, this is the one to buy, but

145
00:09:50,105 --> 00:09:54,045
Speaker 9:  please be aware of these five downsides, he would call me

146
00:09:54,045 --> 00:09:57,965
Speaker 9:  up and complain that I'd put any downsides in. So those were

147
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:00,245
Speaker 9:  the two polls I had, which

148
00:10:00,285 --> 00:10:02,765
Speaker 3:  I figured if you've got them both mad at you, you're probably doing something

149
00:10:02,765 --> 00:10:02,925
Speaker 3:  right.

150
00:10:03,445 --> 00:10:07,405
Speaker 9:  Probably doing something right. Yeah. So as a hobbyist and a customer,

151
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:12,285
Speaker 9:  I thought the Mac was vastly superior. I also owned a, a

152
00:10:12,315 --> 00:10:16,285
Speaker 9:  Doss machine at the time. I had all these computers that I couldn't afford,

153
00:10:16,705 --> 00:10:20,685
Speaker 9:  but I just fell in love with the graphical user interface and, and the Mac.

154
00:10:21,145 --> 00:10:24,965
Speaker 9:  So it's fair to say that Apple helped invent the personal

155
00:10:25,245 --> 00:10:28,845
Speaker 9:  computer. It was one of three companies that in 1977

156
00:10:29,485 --> 00:10:33,125
Speaker 9:  brought out a sort of mass market personal computer

157
00:10:33,575 --> 00:10:37,405
Speaker 9:  where you didn't have to be an engineer to use it, although really you

158
00:10:37,405 --> 00:10:40,845
Speaker 9:  had to be a techie and you know, radio Shack and,

159
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:45,205
Speaker 9:  and Commodore with the others. But the Apple two sort of, once it got

160
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:49,285
Speaker 9:  was VisiCalc, it became the thing that people wanted

161
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:53,685
Speaker 9:  more than the others. So they helped invent the personal computer and

162
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:57,205
Speaker 9:  then they, with the Mac, they completely changed seven years later.

163
00:10:57,745 --> 00:11:01,645
Speaker 9:  The way the personal computer is used to this day, I

164
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:05,245
Speaker 9:  don't know of another computer that's 40 years old.

165
00:11:05,685 --> 00:11:09,205
Speaker 9:  I mean, it's semantics, right? There's been a million different Macs, right?

166
00:11:09,205 --> 00:11:12,845
Speaker 9:  So you could say the iMac that I'm talking to you on is a

167
00:11:12,845 --> 00:11:16,765
Speaker 9:  standalone computer by itself and shouldn't be counted in the 40 year

168
00:11:16,905 --> 00:11:20,445
Speaker 9:  run, but it's all just iterations of the Mac and

169
00:11:21,175 --> 00:11:23,525
Speaker 9:  40 years is sort of incredible.

170
00:11:24,045 --> 00:11:27,725
Speaker 3:  I do think it's true that you can draw an unusually straight line

171
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:31,845
Speaker 3:  from that first Mac to the current crop of Macs. Even just

172
00:11:32,435 --> 00:11:35,925
Speaker 3:  what the thing looks like. I always enjoy going back and looking at you.

173
00:11:35,925 --> 00:11:39,765
Speaker 3:  You look at early versions of like Microsoft Word and Excel and some of these

174
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:43,365
Speaker 3:  things that have really endured over time and in a

175
00:11:43,365 --> 00:11:46,845
Speaker 3:  surprising number of cases, it's amazing how little changes, right? And I

176
00:11:46,845 --> 00:11:49,405
Speaker 3:  think part of that is like there's, there's one way to look at that, that

177
00:11:49,405 --> 00:11:52,525
Speaker 3:  is like maybe a failure of imagination to keep trying and you get a thing

178
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:56,165
Speaker 3:  that works and then it's, it's hard to fight success. But also a lot of these

179
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:59,805
Speaker 3:  things just got a lot of things right the first time. And I think the Mac

180
00:11:59,825 --> 00:12:03,525
Speaker 3:  was one of those things. It the basic sort of tenets of the

181
00:12:03,645 --> 00:12:07,485
Speaker 3:  GUI just were there and I think they were right. And, and everyone has

182
00:12:07,485 --> 00:12:11,205
Speaker 3:  tried. We've seen some people try and sort of reinvent that wheel over and

183
00:12:11,285 --> 00:12:14,925
Speaker 3:  over over time. And for the most part, nothing has been better than that.

184
00:12:15,195 --> 00:12:18,925
Speaker 9:  Well, I think that's right and just to, not to sound like an Apple fanboy,

185
00:12:18,925 --> 00:12:22,645
Speaker 9:  but I mean I think the iPhone was the same way. It obviously

186
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:26,085
Speaker 9:  didn't have the same interface as the Mac, but the iPhone touch

187
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:30,085
Speaker 9:  interface and the, you know, the scrolling and the different things

188
00:12:30,085 --> 00:12:33,765
Speaker 9:  they had are all on Android and, and you know,

189
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:37,245
Speaker 9:  they've borrowed back some things from Android, but largely

190
00:12:37,795 --> 00:12:41,245
Speaker 9:  what Apple sat down for the iPhone is the way

191
00:12:41,705 --> 00:12:45,445
Speaker 9:  all phones work. And what Apple sat down for the Mac is the way all

192
00:12:45,925 --> 00:12:49,885
Speaker 9:  computer, all computers, PCs work. but it wasn't that

193
00:12:49,885 --> 00:12:53,245
Speaker 9:  it didn't have flaws, it cost way too much.

194
00:12:53,415 --> 00:12:56,605
Speaker 3:  Right. I was just gonna ask what columnist Walt would've said about it in

195
00:12:56,765 --> 00:12:58,805
Speaker 3:  1984, and I'm guessing price would've been where you started.

196
00:12:59,165 --> 00:13:02,885
Speaker 9:  I would've said that they got this revolutionary UI or ux

197
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,885
Speaker 9:  correct. but it was out of range for most people

198
00:13:07,225 --> 00:13:11,205
Speaker 9:  and it was outrageous. And I will tell you that when

199
00:13:11,715 --> 00:13:15,205
Speaker 9:  many years later, 2007, we had

200
00:13:15,685 --> 00:13:19,445
Speaker 9:  famously, as you know, Cher and I had Gates and

201
00:13:19,475 --> 00:13:23,245
Speaker 9:  Jobs on stage together in a joint interview. And

202
00:13:23,275 --> 00:13:27,125
Speaker 9:  part of that interview was telling the story of the Mac. one of the things

203
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:31,045
Speaker 9:  that Gate said in that joint interview, he and Jobs were going back and

204
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:34,725
Speaker 9:  forth. Karen and I were going back and forth with them. Gate said,

205
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:38,845
Speaker 9:  you came to me and you said this is gonna be a a, a cheap

206
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:43,125
Speaker 9:  customer priced machine, blah blah. It's gonna do this and that.

207
00:13:43,545 --> 00:13:47,245
Speaker 9:  And when you delivered the machine, I was very excited 'cause the machine

208
00:13:47,245 --> 00:13:51,165
Speaker 9:  really looked good and I really wanted our apps to

209
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:54,965
Speaker 9:  work on it. But every time we had a meeting, the price went up

210
00:13:55,105 --> 00:13:58,885
Speaker 9:  and the price went up and the price went up. And you know,

211
00:13:59,035 --> 00:14:02,885
Speaker 9:  it's not like Microsoft sold its big

212
00:14:03,195 --> 00:14:06,685
Speaker 9:  apps at a or or Windows itself at a bargain

213
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:10,325
Speaker 9:  basement price. Sure. But they couldn't compete with Apple on

214
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:13,445
Speaker 9:  overcharging. I mean, as we are making this

215
00:14:13,995 --> 00:14:17,405
Speaker 9:  podcast, the Apple Vision Pro is coming out at

216
00:14:17,405 --> 00:14:21,365
Speaker 9:  $3,500. Yeah. And we all know that's gonna come

217
00:14:21,365 --> 00:14:25,205
Speaker 9:  down in price and, you know, maybe lose some features

218
00:14:25,205 --> 00:14:28,125
Speaker 9:  or whatever and it's gonna not sell very many at

219
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:32,005
Speaker 9:  $3,500. But that's what they did and that's what they did with the

220
00:14:32,065 --> 00:14:35,605
Speaker 9:  Mac. I think it was partly, 'cause Steve Jobs was a

221
00:14:35,605 --> 00:14:39,565
Speaker 9:  perfectionist. His idea of what was a customer friendly price

222
00:14:39,865 --> 00:14:42,565
Speaker 9:  wasn't really a customer friendly price.

223
00:14:42,955 --> 00:14:46,885
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I, I agree. They, there have definitely been more on the, we're gonna

224
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:50,165
Speaker 3:  make a good thing and you'll pay for it. Which has turned out to work pretty

225
00:14:50,165 --> 00:14:54,005
Speaker 3:  well for them over time, I would say. Why do you think the Mac name has

226
00:14:54,005 --> 00:14:57,245
Speaker 3:  stuck around this long? I, I was just looking back over it. It's, you know,

227
00:14:57,345 --> 00:15:01,245
Speaker 3:  you, we've had several CEOs. Steve Jobs left, Steve Jobs came back,

228
00:15:01,465 --> 00:15:04,005
Speaker 3:  the devices themselves have changed. There have been a million new things.

229
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:07,845
Speaker 3:  And it's like the only constant at Apple for 40 years is that something

230
00:15:07,845 --> 00:15:09,085
Speaker 3:  is called the Mac.

231
00:15:09,705 --> 00:15:13,125
Speaker 9:  Yes. Originally they used the full name Macintosh.

232
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:17,125
Speaker 9:  Right. And don don't know how many years that lasted, but

233
00:15:17,195 --> 00:15:20,925
Speaker 9:  everybody just called it a Mac anyway, everybody who

234
00:15:20,925 --> 00:15:23,805
Speaker 9:  bought it or referred to it or wrote about it, called it a Mac.

235
00:15:23,995 --> 00:15:26,405
Speaker 3:  Even back then, like, you'd be hanging out with your hobbyist friends and

236
00:15:26,405 --> 00:15:28,165
Speaker 3:  you'd be like, oh look, I have a Mac. Yeah,

237
00:15:28,315 --> 00:15:31,685
Speaker 9:  Okay. Nobody said, I mean, you know, maybe for the first six months people

238
00:15:31,795 --> 00:15:35,645
Speaker 9:  said Macintosh and then everybody started calling it a Mac. And so then

239
00:15:35,645 --> 00:15:39,365
Speaker 9:  Apple called it a Mac. And I don't know when the first

240
00:15:39,585 --> 00:15:43,445
Speaker 9:  of, well probably during jobs as exile, when there was

241
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:46,925
Speaker 9:  a parade of horribly incompetent CEOs

242
00:15:47,705 --> 00:15:50,605
Speaker 9:  and product managers and no real

243
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:55,245
Speaker 9:  leaps of improvement in the Mac, they might've

244
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:58,965
Speaker 9:  started calling it the Mac. Then they certainly started calling it the Mac

245
00:15:58,965 --> 00:16:02,485
Speaker 9:  with the iMac, which came out in 1998. And that was jobs in his

246
00:16:02,825 --> 00:16:06,405
Speaker 9:  second coming. But when jobs came back to Apple,

247
00:16:06,825 --> 00:16:10,765
Speaker 9:  he started calling my house and maybe some other journalists, I'm not

248
00:16:10,765 --> 00:16:14,565
Speaker 9:  gonna say it was only me. And we'd have these hour and a half conversations

249
00:16:15,505 --> 00:16:19,285
Speaker 9:  and we talk a lot about the Mac and he and about Apple

250
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:23,005
Speaker 9:  as a company and so forth. But when I went, I, I never forget, I went

251
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:27,325
Speaker 9:  to meet with him around that time around not long after he took over.

252
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:31,565
Speaker 9:  And he said that he was horrified when he got there to find

253
00:16:31,565 --> 00:16:35,005
Speaker 9:  out how many Mac models there were. This shouldn't have happened. There were

254
00:16:35,005 --> 00:16:38,805
Speaker 9:  like Quadras and Performas and I can't

255
00:16:38,925 --> 00:16:42,445
Speaker 9:  remember the other names, but I think most of 'em amended with an A for some

256
00:16:42,445 --> 00:16:46,165
Speaker 9:  reason there were there, there were just different Mac names and it was very

257
00:16:46,165 --> 00:16:49,965
Speaker 9:  hard for consumers to figure out the difference between them. And

258
00:16:49,965 --> 00:16:53,285
Speaker 9:  they have different, they had different sales teams, they had different PR

259
00:16:53,765 --> 00:16:57,565
Speaker 9:  campaigns. It was just ridiculous. They all

260
00:16:57,565 --> 00:17:01,445
Speaker 9:  still were too expensive. They all still were better

261
00:17:01,475 --> 00:17:05,245
Speaker 9:  than Wintel computers, I thought. But they were getting

262
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:09,365
Speaker 9:  worse because it's getting more complicated and all, all this stuff.

263
00:17:09,555 --> 00:17:13,445
Speaker 3:  Yeah. That was when Apple was started to license the idea out to other companies,

264
00:17:13,445 --> 00:17:15,925
Speaker 3:  right? They were gonna let other companies make Macintoshes. That

265
00:17:15,925 --> 00:17:19,565
Speaker 9:  Was the other thing. He was furious. He was fucking furious

266
00:17:19,855 --> 00:17:23,725
Speaker 9:  about it. He said to me, I can't believe they licensed

267
00:17:23,785 --> 00:17:26,965
Speaker 9:  the oss. And then he went to a whole discourse

268
00:17:27,455 --> 00:17:30,965
Speaker 9:  about how you have to make a choice. You can be a company that

269
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:35,045
Speaker 9:  licenses, like we now know Google licenses Android, or you could be

270
00:17:35,085 --> 00:17:38,685
Speaker 9:  a company that does vertical integration and sells the whole thing.

271
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:43,405
Speaker 9:  And or as he liked to say, the whole banana, that was his phrase. But

272
00:17:43,405 --> 00:17:47,085
Speaker 9:  you can't do both really successfully. So he canceled

273
00:17:47,305 --> 00:17:51,125
Speaker 9:  all those licenses and then he did for me, what I think he did

274
00:17:51,145 --> 00:17:54,925
Speaker 9:  for many people was he turned to the whiteboard in the room

275
00:17:54,985 --> 00:17:58,965
Speaker 9:  we were in, which I think was his conference room. And he drew

276
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:03,205
Speaker 9:  a four squares with a marker and he, and one

277
00:18:03,205 --> 00:18:07,005
Speaker 9:  was called consumer and one was called pro. And in

278
00:18:07,105 --> 00:18:10,765
Speaker 9:  the upper left hand box he wrote consumer desktop.

279
00:18:11,225 --> 00:18:15,125
Speaker 9:  And underneath that he wrote consumer laptop. In the upper right hand box

280
00:18:15,145 --> 00:18:18,525
Speaker 9:  he wrote pro desktop and pro

281
00:18:19,025 --> 00:18:22,445
Speaker 9:  laptop. He said, that's all I want, that's all I'm gonna make.

282
00:18:22,775 --> 00:18:26,445
Speaker 9:  Which was true for quite a while. Now I think

283
00:18:26,595 --> 00:18:26,885
Speaker 9:  less

284
00:18:26,885 --> 00:18:27,365
Speaker 3:  True now.

285
00:18:27,635 --> 00:18:31,405
Speaker 9:  Less true. Now, can I tell you just another random anecdote about the

286
00:18:31,405 --> 00:18:32,245
Speaker 3:  Mac? Please go.

287
00:18:32,635 --> 00:18:36,605
Speaker 9:  Okay. So he comes in, he saves the company, he saves the

288
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:40,605
Speaker 9:  Mac. I mean the iMac was genuinely another revolutionary

289
00:18:40,675 --> 00:18:44,605
Speaker 9:  step. Yeah. Revolutionary because it had every

290
00:18:45,295 --> 00:18:47,205
Speaker 9:  capability you wanted in it.

291
00:18:47,515 --> 00:18:50,645
Speaker 3:  Part of what I think is so interesting about that is that there are kind

292
00:18:50,645 --> 00:18:54,525
Speaker 3:  of those two distinct eras of the Mac, right? And I

293
00:18:54,525 --> 00:18:58,485
Speaker 3:  think, I think the iMac launch is a perfect sort of middle moment

294
00:18:58,585 --> 00:19:02,565
Speaker 3:  of the story. Because without it, like not only would Apple maybe have

295
00:19:02,565 --> 00:19:06,205
Speaker 3:  died, the Mac would've maybe gone away too. But then that was like

296
00:19:06,575 --> 00:19:09,845
Speaker 3:  Steve Jobs coming back in and, and sort of reaching back to 1984 and being

297
00:19:09,845 --> 00:19:13,245
Speaker 3:  like, no, this is, I am going to redraw the line back to that thing

298
00:19:13,595 --> 00:19:17,445
Speaker 3:  from this new device that we're making. Which is kind of a, just from a

299
00:19:17,445 --> 00:19:21,325
Speaker 3:  like business leader perspective, sort of remarkable in

300
00:19:21,685 --> 00:19:25,525
Speaker 3:  retrospect. And then from there it just, it has continued on in that

301
00:19:25,525 --> 00:19:26,925
Speaker 3:  same way for a really long time.

302
00:19:27,235 --> 00:19:31,045
Speaker 9:  Well, I would call the first iMac the funny rounded one

303
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:34,365
Speaker 9:  that you could, it was either translucent or in one case

304
00:19:34,395 --> 00:19:37,005
Speaker 9:  transparent, had all these colors. I

305
00:19:37,005 --> 00:19:38,005
Speaker 3:  Love that thing. You're

306
00:19:38,005 --> 00:19:41,765
Speaker 9:  Right. That you could think of it as the middle, but I would call it the

307
00:19:42,185 --> 00:19:46,125
Speaker 9:  second true second generation of the Mac. Okay. I mean the Mac

308
00:19:46,225 --> 00:19:50,045
Speaker 9:  had a number of smaller generations. Like I mentioned at one point

309
00:19:50,045 --> 00:19:53,765
Speaker 9:  they put a hard disc in it and then they branched it out

310
00:19:53,765 --> 00:19:57,645
Speaker 9:  into all these crazy models. But the iMac was really,

311
00:19:58,345 --> 00:20:02,165
Speaker 9:  here's what the Mac is now given the internet given

312
00:20:02,565 --> 00:20:06,445
Speaker 9:  1998, whatever, you know? Yeah. And you know,

313
00:20:06,445 --> 00:20:10,405
Speaker 9:  they did rip mix burn, they did all billboards that said that

314
00:20:10,405 --> 00:20:13,885
Speaker 9:  they did all those things. But then they did the, after the iMac, they did

315
00:20:13,885 --> 00:20:17,805
Speaker 9:  the I book, which was also very colorful, but

316
00:20:17,805 --> 00:20:21,525
Speaker 9:  it was shaped as many people noted, like a toilet seat.

317
00:20:22,865 --> 00:20:23,325
Speaker 9:  It was David,

318
00:20:23,365 --> 00:20:25,405
Speaker 3:  I was, you're not wrong, it was

319
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:30,165
Speaker 9:  My wife got one and just loved it. She did not

320
00:20:30,425 --> 00:20:33,605
Speaker 9:  get Doss or Windows. She had a Windows machine.

321
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:38,125
Speaker 9:  She struggled with it. She refused to buy a, a

322
00:20:38,185 --> 00:20:41,885
Speaker 9:  laptop because she didn't wanna struggle with that. And then I convinced

323
00:20:41,885 --> 00:20:45,845
Speaker 9:  her to buy this iBook and she didn't want to give it up. Even when it

324
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:49,805
Speaker 9:  was long past its sell by date. I mean, you know,

325
00:20:50,105 --> 00:20:51,325
Speaker 9:  she just didn't wanna give it up.

326
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,125
Speaker 3:  So I'm hearing you say that I'm struck by how experimental

327
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:59,045
Speaker 3:  all of that stuff was. There was such a long time where Apple just tried

328
00:20:59,305 --> 00:21:02,445
Speaker 3:  so many things and some of them were great and some of them were super weird.

329
00:21:02,825 --> 00:21:06,125
Speaker 3:  And I mean, especially in the iMac line, like good God, they tried every

330
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:09,845
Speaker 3:  imaginable shape of computer you could make there for a while it felt like,

331
00:21:10,265 --> 00:21:13,085
Speaker 9:  Hey, the cube was beautiful. It was beautiful.

332
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:15,405
Speaker 3:  It was, it was Everybody fell for the cube. Yeah.

333
00:21:15,695 --> 00:21:19,605
Speaker 9:  Until it cracked. And until you figured out that you

334
00:21:19,605 --> 00:21:23,565
Speaker 9:  were getting an underpowered computer for a grossly high price.

335
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:24,005
Speaker 9:  But

336
00:21:24,085 --> 00:21:27,485
Speaker 3:  Hey, it was beautiful. I'll, I'll give you that. but it seems like now

337
00:21:27,915 --> 00:21:31,525
Speaker 3:  there's just much less of that. And on the one hand, I, I actually think

338
00:21:32,305 --> 00:21:35,525
Speaker 3:  Max in general, they're obviously better than ever, but I think even

339
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:39,245
Speaker 3:  comparatively better than ever, like we're at a point now where the MacBook

340
00:21:39,245 --> 00:21:42,965
Speaker 3:  is so dramatically better than anything you can buy for Windows right now.

341
00:21:42,965 --> 00:21:45,365
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And I'm gonna get a bunch of angry emails for saying that, but I think

342
00:21:45,365 --> 00:21:49,085
Speaker 3:  it's true. And yet it feels like we've spent the last decade or so

343
00:21:49,145 --> 00:21:52,925
Speaker 3:  on this phase of just sort of gentle refinement of a bunch of ideas, right?

344
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:56,365
Speaker 3:  And even the new stuff like a Mac Studio is just a slightly different sized

345
00:21:56,465 --> 00:22:00,045
Speaker 3:  box for a thing that already existed. Are we just done with the experimenting

346
00:22:00,045 --> 00:22:03,405
Speaker 3:  phase? Like is the next 40 years of Mac, 40 years of gentle

347
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:04,125
Speaker 3:  refinement?

348
00:22:04,635 --> 00:22:06,445
Speaker 9:  Well, couple of things about that.

349
00:22:06,715 --> 00:22:09,405
Speaker 3:  This is a lead into a question about the Vision Pro by the way. So we're

350
00:22:09,405 --> 00:22:09,965
Speaker 3:  gonna get there too.

351
00:22:10,305 --> 00:22:14,125
Speaker 9:  One is Apple is no longer led by a product guy,

352
00:22:14,425 --> 00:22:18,005
Speaker 9:  no longer led by a product guy. There's a lot of good things about Tim Cook.

353
00:22:18,525 --> 00:22:22,325
Speaker 9:  I personally like Tim Cook. I've met with him not

354
00:22:22,325 --> 00:22:25,965
Speaker 9:  as much as I met with jobs over the years, but I have had some

355
00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:29,885
Speaker 9:  one-on-ones with him. He's a smart guy and he's obviously

356
00:22:30,465 --> 00:22:33,925
Speaker 9:  on the financial side. I mean the company has never done better.

357
00:22:34,535 --> 00:22:38,445
Speaker 9:  Steve in maybe 40 hours of meetings with Steve

358
00:22:38,445 --> 00:22:42,245
Speaker 9:  Jobs. He never mentioned the stock. He never, and by the way,

359
00:22:42,545 --> 00:22:46,525
Speaker 9:  he boycotted all the analysts quarterly phone calls he never

360
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:47,285
Speaker 9:  appeared on. Oh,

361
00:22:47,405 --> 00:22:47,845
Speaker 3:  Interesting. Okay.

362
00:22:47,995 --> 00:22:51,285
Speaker 9:  With one exception, they had a scandal one year.

363
00:22:51,825 --> 00:22:55,525
Speaker 9:  He considered it a fake scandal, but it was called Antennagate.

364
00:22:55,885 --> 00:22:57,285
Speaker 3:  I was about to guess that's what it was.

365
00:22:57,435 --> 00:23:00,965
Speaker 9:  This was on the iPhone, not the Mac, but they put the antenna on the outside

366
00:23:01,025 --> 00:23:05,005
Speaker 9:  and if you grabbed it in a certain way, you attenuated the signal,

367
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:07,365
Speaker 3:  The you're holding it wrong. Scandal. Yeah.

368
00:23:07,705 --> 00:23:11,565
Speaker 9:  And so he made rubber bumpers and you could get one for free and all that.

369
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:15,765
Speaker 9:  And for that quarter he appeared on the analyst call, but otherwise

370
00:23:15,865 --> 00:23:19,725
Speaker 9:  he didn't. So Tim is kind of interested in

371
00:23:19,725 --> 00:23:23,645
Speaker 9:  that and operations, which was his job. He

372
00:23:23,645 --> 00:23:27,565
Speaker 9:  was handpicked by Steve as his successor, but he wasn't

373
00:23:27,685 --> 00:23:31,205
Speaker 9:  a product guy. And this leads me to tell you a story when you talk about

374
00:23:31,205 --> 00:23:34,925
Speaker 9:  the Mac sort of stagnating, even after Steve

375
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:38,765
Speaker 9:  came back and got rid of all the extra models and the licensing and all that,

376
00:23:39,135 --> 00:23:42,925
Speaker 9:  their biggest seller, and in my opinion, I've written this many times,

377
00:23:43,115 --> 00:23:46,765
Speaker 9:  I'll be happy to say it right here. So I can share the hate mail with you.

378
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:51,085
Speaker 9:  The MacBook Air was the best laptop ever made,

379
00:23:51,545 --> 00:23:55,525
Speaker 9:  at least starting with the 2010 redesign. The one

380
00:23:55,525 --> 00:23:59,045
Speaker 9:  that he introduced by pulling it out of an envelope. The original one

381
00:23:59,345 --> 00:24:03,125
Speaker 9:  was fabulously thin. Nobody could believe a computer be that thin,

382
00:24:03,825 --> 00:24:06,645
Speaker 9:  but it was, it had some performance issues.

383
00:24:07,035 --> 00:24:10,205
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Another one in that vein of spectacular idea,

384
00:24:10,695 --> 00:24:12,405
Speaker 3:  overpriced and kind of underpowered.

385
00:24:12,545 --> 00:24:16,325
Speaker 9:  But it did well enough that they invested and in 2010 they

386
00:24:16,325 --> 00:24:19,965
Speaker 9:  made the one we're all familiar with until very recently with the

387
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:23,965
Speaker 9:  tapered edge. So I wrote four or five times

388
00:24:24,115 --> 00:24:28,005
Speaker 9:  over 20 years. I wrote, this is the best laptop

389
00:24:28,005 --> 00:24:31,445
Speaker 9:  ever built. And the fact is, it was their best selling product.

390
00:24:31,775 --> 00:24:35,485
Speaker 9:  There were some years where it was the best selling PC individual

391
00:24:35,615 --> 00:24:39,605
Speaker 9:  model of pc. Obviously they never outsold win the Windows

392
00:24:40,265 --> 00:24:44,085
Speaker 9:  PCs. Sure. But individual model of PC was the best seller.

393
00:24:44,585 --> 00:24:48,565
Speaker 9:  And for 20 years, the Windows guys tried to chase it and then

394
00:24:48,595 --> 00:24:52,405
Speaker 9:  they got crazy. Right. They started trying once

395
00:24:52,425 --> 00:24:56,205
Speaker 9:  it would fold and become a tablet and it was always like an inch and a half

396
00:24:56,295 --> 00:25:00,125
Speaker 9:  thick and all this crazy stuff. I once on

397
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:03,365
Speaker 9:  stage at the very first D conference was, was in

398
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:07,485
Speaker 9:  2003. So two years after the iPod came

399
00:25:07,485 --> 00:25:11,085
Speaker 9:  out, it was just an interview I had with, I don't even think Kara was there,

400
00:25:11,085 --> 00:25:14,925
Speaker 9:  it was just me and Jobs. And I said, you know, you've done

401
00:25:14,945 --> 00:25:18,205
Speaker 9:  all this stuff. You've invented the I the iMac

402
00:25:18,745 --> 00:25:21,725
Speaker 9:  and you're still at five or

403
00:25:22,295 --> 00:25:25,965
Speaker 9:  7% or whatever it was of the market. Yeah.

404
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:30,165
Speaker 9:  I said, how are you ever gonna move the needle on that? He said,

405
00:25:30,165 --> 00:25:33,765
Speaker 9:  well, we're moving the needle little bit by little bit. But he said, we're

406
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:37,565
Speaker 9:  never gonna outsell windows in computers. But he said, I

407
00:25:37,565 --> 00:25:41,405
Speaker 9:  love the iPod. And I said, why? He said, because I'm really tired of

408
00:25:41,405 --> 00:25:42,685
Speaker 9:  being 5% of the market.

409
00:25:44,905 --> 00:25:48,405
Speaker 9:  And the iPod was like 85% of the market, or

410
00:25:48,405 --> 00:25:52,205
Speaker 9:  75 whatever at the time. So he, that revealed to me

411
00:25:52,205 --> 00:25:55,725
Speaker 9:  that it really bothered him that his baby,

412
00:25:55,985 --> 00:25:59,805
Speaker 9:  his invention, the m, he could blame all

413
00:25:59,805 --> 00:26:03,565
Speaker 9:  the bo, what he called the bozos who were there when he was off

414
00:26:03,575 --> 00:26:07,565
Speaker 9:  doing another failed company next. He could blame all of

415
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:11,525
Speaker 9:  them. That was a 12 year gap. But nevertheless, the M

416
00:26:11,525 --> 00:26:13,925
Speaker 9:  Mac just just never, never made it.

417
00:26:14,145 --> 00:26:18,085
Speaker 3:  And yeah, and in some ways it's, it's now more successful than it

418
00:26:18,085 --> 00:26:18,685
Speaker 3:  ever has been.

419
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:22,205
Speaker 9:  Oh, it ab absolutely is. It's very successful.

420
00:26:22,635 --> 00:26:26,565
Speaker 3:  There's seemingly real runway on this idea left I

421
00:26:26,565 --> 00:26:30,325
Speaker 3:  think is kind of wild and is really the most remarkable thing about the Maxima

422
00:26:30,325 --> 00:26:33,965
Speaker 3:  is that it doesn't feel like an old idea even that at this point in tech.

423
00:26:33,965 --> 00:26:35,605
Speaker 3:  It's a really old idea. Well

424
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:39,565
Speaker 9:  They re just redesigned the MacBook Air. Yeah. Radically. I'm

425
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:43,485
Speaker 9:  not sure I like it. I like, I like the other one better. Yeah. But I'll just

426
00:26:43,485 --> 00:26:47,325
Speaker 9:  tell you one more story before you get to the Vision Pro. Tim is a guy.

427
00:26:47,325 --> 00:26:50,605
Speaker 9:  Who knows what he doesn't know. He knew he wasn't a product guy.

428
00:26:51,145 --> 00:26:54,925
Speaker 9:  So he, he gave even more power to Johnny.

429
00:26:55,265 --> 00:26:58,805
Speaker 9:  Ive their great designer. Eventually he gave him software,

430
00:26:59,065 --> 00:27:02,885
Speaker 9:  not just hardware, he gave him everything. Right. And here's the difference,

431
00:27:02,885 --> 00:27:06,725
Speaker 9:  Johnny Ive was a great designer and he had, sure, he had some

432
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:10,205
Speaker 9:  great designers under him. They probably still have a great design shot.

433
00:27:10,615 --> 00:27:14,445
Speaker 9:  Steve Jobs was his editor. Steve Jobs would pull him

434
00:27:14,445 --> 00:27:18,325
Speaker 9:  away from his crazier instincts. Steve Jobs would say no

435
00:27:18,505 --> 00:27:22,405
Speaker 9:  to some things and yes to other things. Tim Cook didn't

436
00:27:22,705 --> 00:27:26,645
Speaker 9:  do that. Right. I don't think does that to this day because he knows what

437
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:30,045
Speaker 9:  he doesn't know. And Johnny, ive decided

438
00:27:30,525 --> 00:27:34,365
Speaker 9:  I can't, I have no proof for what I'm saying, except I have a very high level

439
00:27:34,385 --> 00:27:38,205
Speaker 9:  source who told me this story. That's my, but it's a one source

440
00:27:38,535 --> 00:27:39,565
Speaker 9:  story. This is

441
00:27:39,565 --> 00:27:41,765
Speaker 3:  Good, good journalistic rigor on your part here. I like this.

442
00:27:42,385 --> 00:27:46,205
Speaker 9:  No, I'm make it clear to you that it's not full journalistic rigor. Sure.

443
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:50,165
Speaker 9:  But this person really knew, really super knew

444
00:27:50,185 --> 00:27:54,045
Speaker 9:  the products. What he said was, after Cook had given

445
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:57,925
Speaker 9:  Johnny all his power and Johnny no longer had an editor who

446
00:27:57,925 --> 00:28:01,085
Speaker 9:  went to a lunch with him every day, which was what jobs did,

447
00:28:01,705 --> 00:28:05,605
Speaker 9:  he decided they didn't need to be an he and a pro. He

448
00:28:05,605 --> 00:28:09,485
Speaker 9:  decided he could do the pro and make it as light and

449
00:28:09,505 --> 00:28:13,325
Speaker 9:  as thin or thinner than the MacBook Air and

450
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:17,685
Speaker 9:  it would be a higher price machine. So that would be better for their bottom

451
00:28:17,795 --> 00:28:21,765
Speaker 9:  line. And people would buy it even if they didn't need the

452
00:28:21,765 --> 00:28:25,685
Speaker 9:  extra power it gave. And so he could have one laptop that

453
00:28:25,685 --> 00:28:29,485
Speaker 9:  would do everything. And you might say, well that kind of even jobs in

454
00:28:29,485 --> 00:28:33,245
Speaker 9:  his four square thing had two laptops, a consumer and a pro.

455
00:28:33,305 --> 00:28:36,605
Speaker 9:  But Johnny wanted to have one laptop. And

456
00:28:37,095 --> 00:28:40,685
Speaker 9:  there was a big war between the design team

457
00:28:40,905 --> 00:28:44,485
Speaker 9:  and its acolytes. In other words, the Johnny I've led team

458
00:28:45,065 --> 00:28:49,045
Speaker 9:  and the engineering and product manager side of the company,

459
00:28:49,255 --> 00:28:53,125
Speaker 9:  which desperately wanted new improved versions of the

460
00:28:53,185 --> 00:28:56,325
Speaker 9:  air. 'cause the air was the, their bestselling product,

461
00:28:57,445 --> 00:29:01,205
Speaker 9:  probably the bestselling laptop in the world, the thing everyone was chasing.

462
00:29:01,385 --> 00:29:04,965
Speaker 9:  And they did not wanna leave it on a hill to die. But that's what they thought

463
00:29:04,985 --> 00:29:08,805
Speaker 9:  was happening. Hmm. And they, this battle kept up for a while and

464
00:29:08,835 --> 00:29:12,685
Speaker 9:  finally the product guys and the engineers

465
00:29:12,685 --> 00:29:16,285
Speaker 9:  managed to yank, yank it back. And they brought out a new

466
00:29:16,285 --> 00:29:19,805
Speaker 9:  MacBook Air with very minimal changes. but it was a new model.

467
00:29:20,505 --> 00:29:24,365
Speaker 9:  It had, I think more storage faster,

468
00:29:24,665 --> 00:29:25,925
Speaker 9:  you know, whatever. Basically

469
00:29:25,925 --> 00:29:27,485
Speaker 3:  Like a spec bump of a laptop.

470
00:29:27,485 --> 00:29:31,325
Speaker 9:  Correct. Yeah. And I remember that they introduced it at the Brooklyn

471
00:29:31,325 --> 00:29:35,045
Speaker 9:  Academy of Music and this source of mine pulled me aside and

472
00:29:35,075 --> 00:29:39,005
Speaker 9:  said we finally won. Mm. And then it was

473
00:29:39,025 --> 00:29:42,885
Speaker 9:  the first, I think it was the first machine or one of the first machines

474
00:29:43,265 --> 00:29:47,125
Speaker 9:  to get Apple Silicon So I still have, still have an M1

475
00:29:47,275 --> 00:29:50,965
Speaker 9:  MacBook Air, you being a professional

476
00:29:51,325 --> 00:29:55,285
Speaker 9:  computer writer, probably have an M three Pro or something. But

477
00:29:55,315 --> 00:29:55,885
Speaker 9:  believe it

478
00:29:55,885 --> 00:29:59,725
Speaker 3:  Or not, as a testament to how good this stuff has been, I'm still very happily

479
00:29:59,905 --> 00:30:03,805
Speaker 3:  on an M1 MacBook Air. I upgraded basically every minute

480
00:30:04,045 --> 00:30:07,525
Speaker 3:  I could new computers until I got to Apple Silicon. And I've been happy with

481
00:30:07,525 --> 00:30:09,525
Speaker 3:  the M1 for, what, three years now? Yeah,

482
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:11,685
Speaker 9:  Me too. Well good, good for you. Yeah.

483
00:30:12,065 --> 00:30:15,485
Speaker 3:  But wait, what I really wanna know is you very famously bought two

484
00:30:15,795 --> 00:30:19,765
Speaker 3:  MacBook errors. Yeah. Before all of the MacBook

485
00:30:19,765 --> 00:30:23,005
Speaker 3:  Air stuff got weird with the butterfly keyboards and all the nonsense they

486
00:30:23,005 --> 00:30:26,485
Speaker 3:  were doing to those computers on the idea that, you know, when my computer

487
00:30:26,485 --> 00:30:29,685
Speaker 3:  runs out, I'll still have one that I like. That's right. Have, have you been

488
00:30:29,685 --> 00:30:33,565
Speaker 3:  able to safely get rid of the backup MacBook Air? Has Apple won

489
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,205
Speaker 3:  you back with Apple silicon that now you can buy the new ones instead

490
00:30:36,365 --> 00:30:40,005
Speaker 9:  Of the backup? MacBook Air to my wife

491
00:30:40,235 --> 00:30:44,085
Speaker 9:  Chagrin is still, I think in the basement wrapped up in

492
00:30:44,085 --> 00:30:47,925
Speaker 9:  plastic, in the box, in the plastic thing.

493
00:30:47,945 --> 00:30:48,245
Speaker 9:  You know,

494
00:30:48,315 --> 00:30:48,885
Speaker 3:  Just in case.

495
00:30:48,955 --> 00:30:52,925
Speaker 9:  Just in case. But I love my M1 MacBook Air.

496
00:30:52,995 --> 00:30:56,685
Speaker 9:  It's what I use all the time. When I'm, when I'm using

497
00:30:57,405 --> 00:31:00,965
Speaker 9:  a Mac or any computer, I'll be honest with you, I, I

498
00:31:01,405 --> 00:31:05,285
Speaker 9:  probably do 75% of my computing on an iPad or an iPhone

499
00:31:05,385 --> 00:31:09,325
Speaker 9:  now. But when I need to use a computer, like right now, this is an

500
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:13,405
Speaker 9:  iMac, it's an M1 iMac and it's, it's fine.

501
00:31:13,465 --> 00:31:17,405
Speaker 9:  And the MacBook Air is fine and these are Macs and

502
00:31:17,405 --> 00:31:21,005
Speaker 9:  the Mac has been better than fine for its

503
00:31:21,095 --> 00:31:21,725
Speaker 9:  whole life.

504
00:31:22,345 --> 00:31:25,325
Speaker 3:  So, okay. Before, before I let you go here, let's talk about the Vision Pro

505
00:31:25,325 --> 00:31:28,925
Speaker 3:  just for a minute. Because the big question now is like, is this

506
00:31:29,425 --> 00:31:33,405
Speaker 3:  the beginning of a new 40 year cycle? Are we, are you and I

507
00:31:33,405 --> 00:31:36,925
Speaker 3:  gonna podcast in 2064, about

508
00:31:37,545 --> 00:31:41,245
Speaker 3:  how incredible the moment that the Vision Pro came out was and how the world

509
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:44,925
Speaker 3:  will never be the same? There are some things that, there's a new

510
00:31:44,925 --> 00:31:48,565
Speaker 3:  interface idea, there's a thing that is probably overpriced and

511
00:31:48,565 --> 00:31:52,405
Speaker 3:  underpowered, but seems to have some interesting ideas. What do you think

512
00:31:52,405 --> 00:31:53,965
Speaker 3:  about where we are at the Vision Pro right now?

513
00:31:54,235 --> 00:31:58,205
Speaker 9:  Well, I think they think that you're right that this

514
00:31:58,205 --> 00:32:02,125
Speaker 9:  will be like a, a new Mac or a new iPhone and last I don Dunno

515
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:06,005
Speaker 9:  how long the iPhone will last, but 17 years for phone seems like a long time

516
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:06,685
Speaker 9:  Still pretty

517
00:32:06,685 --> 00:32:07,445
Speaker 3:  Good. Yeah. That's

518
00:32:07,445 --> 00:32:11,365
Speaker 9:  What I think They think they're embarked on and they're very realistic.

519
00:32:11,435 --> 00:32:15,085
Speaker 9:  They knew, they know this. I, I, we don't have the numbers yet, but they

520
00:32:15,085 --> 00:32:18,845
Speaker 9:  know that this one is gonna sell less than a million in its first

521
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:22,725
Speaker 9:  year and all of that. They don't expect millions of people to go

522
00:32:22,725 --> 00:32:26,205
Speaker 9:  out and buy a $3,500 thing, which you

523
00:32:26,475 --> 00:32:30,205
Speaker 9:  with a battery that lasts two hours and is separate from the

524
00:32:30,205 --> 00:32:34,125
Speaker 9:  device and you know, all the other things. On the other hand, they

525
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:38,085
Speaker 9:  think what they like to call spatial computing is a real thing

526
00:32:38,105 --> 00:32:41,405
Speaker 9:  and has a lot of potential even that every major

527
00:32:41,965 --> 00:32:45,765
Speaker 9:  possible developer has refused to build something for it. Yeah,

528
00:32:46,075 --> 00:32:49,685
Speaker 9:  that was actually true on the Mac too, by the way. Microsoft and

529
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:53,165
Speaker 9:  Adobe were the only ones that built anything for it. And then

530
00:32:53,395 --> 00:32:56,765
Speaker 9:  Apple's in-house stuff at the beginning, So

531
00:32:57,325 --> 00:33:01,165
Speaker 9:  I think that's what they think. What do I think? I think it

532
00:33:01,165 --> 00:33:04,805
Speaker 9:  depends on how smart and fast

533
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:08,685
Speaker 9:  they are at getting the price down without too

534
00:33:08,685 --> 00:33:12,285
Speaker 9:  much sacrifice and features and also at

535
00:33:12,285 --> 00:33:15,725
Speaker 9:  getting the size of it down. And those two things may not

536
00:33:16,225 --> 00:33:20,045
Speaker 9:  run in tandem. There may be a cheaper version of

537
00:33:20,045 --> 00:33:23,965
Speaker 9:  what we have now. This big thing you wear in your face with very poor

538
00:33:23,965 --> 00:33:27,285
Speaker 9:  battery life and at the same time, maybe a year later

539
00:33:27,795 --> 00:33:31,645
Speaker 9:  they'll start, start to shrink the size of it until

540
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,885
Speaker 9:  eventually they, in their dreams and this is their dream.

541
00:33:36,445 --> 00:33:40,405
Speaker 9:  I know that, I know for a hundred percent fact that this is Tim

542
00:33:40,545 --> 00:33:44,525
Speaker 9:  Cook's dream that it gets to be these, it gets to be

543
00:33:44,525 --> 00:33:48,445
Speaker 9:  like this. Don't ask me how you can pack a battery and all

544
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:52,165
Speaker 9:  that power into this and there's no cord going down and all that, but

545
00:33:52,465 --> 00:33:56,045
Speaker 9:  you know, electricity still can't be carried over wifi or

546
00:33:56,045 --> 00:33:59,885
Speaker 9:  Bluetooth and all that. I think that's their ultimate goal.

547
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:03,805
Speaker 9:  I don't know if they can ever reach that goal, but it

548
00:34:03,805 --> 00:34:07,565
Speaker 9:  also could be that society kind of gets used to things not being worn in

549
00:34:07,565 --> 00:34:11,525
Speaker 9:  your face. As long as they're not as huge as this and

550
00:34:11,795 --> 00:34:15,605
Speaker 9:  they may be able to go half the size of this and be okay,

551
00:34:16,325 --> 00:34:20,285
Speaker 9:  I don don't know. I certainly would not be willing to say it's a 40

552
00:34:20,315 --> 00:34:24,245
Speaker 9:  year product. But you're not ruling out that they're onto something. I

553
00:34:24,245 --> 00:34:28,125
Speaker 9:  don't think it's a one year product because they have a lot of money and

554
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:32,085
Speaker 9:  they already have a roadmap. It's more than a roadmap.

555
00:34:32,085 --> 00:34:35,765
Speaker 9:  They're already designing the next one to be less money.

556
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:40,005
Speaker 9:  They have a roadmap for the next three after that. So

557
00:34:40,005 --> 00:34:43,965
Speaker 9:  it could be a, if it's a failure, it could be a four or five year, three

558
00:34:43,965 --> 00:34:47,925
Speaker 9:  or four year product. If it's not a failure and they're selling a

559
00:34:47,925 --> 00:34:51,605
Speaker 9:  plausible amount and the margin is good and all of that, and they're not

560
00:34:51,605 --> 00:34:55,565
Speaker 9:  losing money on it, they'll never break out sales on it. I'm

561
00:34:55,565 --> 00:34:59,525
Speaker 9:  sure unless a miracle happens and they sell a million in the

562
00:34:59,615 --> 00:35:03,365
Speaker 9:  first month, then there will be a press release a hundred

563
00:35:03,365 --> 00:35:06,645
Speaker 9:  percent. There'll be a press release. I agree that and the stock will shoot

564
00:35:06,665 --> 00:35:10,525
Speaker 9:  up. But you know, this is a new area. Meta

565
00:35:10,665 --> 00:35:14,365
Speaker 9:  is involved in it in certain ways. You know, it's,

566
00:35:14,395 --> 00:35:18,205
Speaker 9:  it's worth watching. You guys have covered it very well. My

567
00:35:18,295 --> 00:35:22,045
Speaker 9:  impression so far from everybody, including NELI

568
00:35:22,465 --> 00:35:25,645
Speaker 9:  in the first look is technically

569
00:35:26,555 --> 00:35:30,005
Speaker 9:  it's genius. They've technically done a genius job,

570
00:35:30,705 --> 00:35:34,525
Speaker 9:  but in terms of the price and the overall

571
00:35:34,585 --> 00:35:38,325
Speaker 9:  design, it's not something people will wanna buy.

572
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:41,765
Speaker 3:  I I think you're right. And I think, again, thinking about like a, the 40

573
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:45,685
Speaker 3:  year legacy of, of something like the Mac, I think the iPhone is

574
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:49,285
Speaker 3:  sort of a clear before and after moment, right? I think the, the day the

575
00:35:49,285 --> 00:35:51,605
Speaker 3:  iPhone came out, there was this thing that happened and everybody's like,

576
00:35:51,605 --> 00:35:52,565
Speaker 3:  oh, this is it. Yeah.

577
00:35:52,565 --> 00:35:55,405
Speaker 9:  But they still had to cut the price on it by a hundred bucks.

578
00:35:55,675 --> 00:35:58,885
Speaker 3:  Sure. I no, I I totally think that's right. That was another example of right,

579
00:35:58,885 --> 00:36:02,565
Speaker 3:  kind of overpriced and underpowered, but it was obvious there was something

580
00:36:02,695 --> 00:36:03,045
Speaker 3:  there

581
00:36:03,475 --> 00:36:05,165
Speaker 9:  Obvious, instantly obvious.

582
00:36:05,795 --> 00:36:09,485
Speaker 3:  This one, it's a little less obvious and So I think the, the

583
00:36:09,725 --> 00:36:12,685
Speaker 3:  question of the next couple of years. Like, I think you're right that evaluating

584
00:36:13,145 --> 00:36:16,325
Speaker 3:  the idea of the Vision Pro on this object

585
00:36:17,025 --> 00:36:20,045
Speaker 3:  is actually not the right way to think about it. So I'm trying to think about

586
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:22,885
Speaker 3:  sort of the five year run before we see the five year run, if that makes

587
00:36:22,885 --> 00:36:26,405
Speaker 3:  sense. And I, I think it's, there are reasons to think we might look back

588
00:36:26,405 --> 00:36:30,285
Speaker 3:  on this as the beginning of something cool, overpriced and

589
00:36:30,285 --> 00:36:34,165
Speaker 3:  underpowered, but on the right track. But at least to me it doesn't

590
00:36:34,585 --> 00:36:38,085
Speaker 3:  scream this is the right idea to me. The way the iPhone did,

591
00:36:38,525 --> 00:36:41,965
Speaker 9:  I mean look, he, the iPhone and the Mac actually

592
00:36:42,275 --> 00:36:45,925
Speaker 9:  both had to have price reductions. And in the case of the

593
00:36:45,925 --> 00:36:49,685
Speaker 9:  iPhone, we'll all remember that, you know, it started out without

594
00:36:50,235 --> 00:36:54,085
Speaker 9:  copy and Paste started out with a bunch of stuff that was

595
00:36:54,085 --> 00:36:58,045
Speaker 9:  missing. So it might've been the third version of the iPhone or the

596
00:36:58,045 --> 00:37:01,845
Speaker 9:  one where they got off edge. I, which I think was the third, was the three

597
00:37:02,185 --> 00:37:05,805
Speaker 9:  gss in some ways that was the first full fledged iPhone. And you know, then,

598
00:37:05,955 --> 00:37:09,645
Speaker 9:  then the hockey stick began, saw a chart just yesterday,

599
00:37:10,065 --> 00:37:13,685
Speaker 9:  but it was like an Apple chart. It was, it was not from Apple, but it was

600
00:37:13,685 --> 00:37:17,485
Speaker 9:  like an Apple chart in that it didn't have very many numbers for the

601
00:37:17,565 --> 00:37:18,525
Speaker 9:  x and Y axis

602
00:37:18,685 --> 00:37:20,645
Speaker 3:  Just had lines going up. You, you couldn't really

603
00:37:20,645 --> 00:37:24,325
Speaker 9:  Tell they were nice. It was a colored chart, you know, it said

604
00:37:24,505 --> 00:37:28,485
Speaker 9:  yellow as the Mac and green as everything else. don don't

605
00:37:28,485 --> 00:37:32,365
Speaker 9:  know. But so they've about tripled what their share was early.

606
00:37:33,025 --> 00:37:36,725
Speaker 9:  And I assume, I mean it's a, if the Mac

607
00:37:36,825 --> 00:37:40,405
Speaker 9:  was taken out of Apple, I think it's a $30 billion

608
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,285
Speaker 9:  business. Am I right? Something like that.

609
00:37:42,395 --> 00:37:43,685
Speaker 3:  That sounds right. Yeah. If it was

610
00:37:43,735 --> 00:37:47,605
Speaker 9:  Taken out of Apple, it would be a Fortune 500 company

611
00:37:48,505 --> 00:37:51,925
Speaker 9:  all by itself. Same is true of course of the iPhone,

612
00:37:52,465 --> 00:37:55,925
Speaker 9:  but the Mac, which was long considered, you know, like

613
00:37:56,065 --> 00:38:00,005
Speaker 9:  almost dying and it was the last thing and all that, it would be

614
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,645
Speaker 9:  a Fortune 500 company.

615
00:38:01,715 --> 00:38:03,845
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Not bad for being 40 years old. Not

616
00:38:03,845 --> 00:38:05,485
Speaker 9:  Bad for being 40 years old.

617
00:38:06,065 --> 00:38:09,925
Speaker 3:  All right, well I'm putting 2064 on the calendar for our 40 year

618
00:38:09,925 --> 00:38:13,725
Speaker 3:  Vision Pro retrospective and between now and then we're, we're gonna have

619
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:16,245
Speaker 3:  to have lots of reasons to have you back on. Thank you for doing this. This

620
00:38:16,245 --> 00:38:16,485
Speaker 3:  was super

621
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,245
Speaker 9:  Fun. I I'd love to do it.

622
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:21,645
Speaker 3:  Alright, we gotta take a break and then we're gonna come back and talk about

623
00:38:21,645 --> 00:38:25,605
Speaker 3:  getting things done, being productive, being a person on the

624
00:38:25,765 --> 00:38:29,525
Speaker 3:  internet and why overthinking your productivity system might not be such

625
00:38:29,525 --> 00:38:31,045
Speaker 3:  a good idea. We'll be right back.

626
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:07,835
Speaker 3:  All right, we're back. If you've been listening to this show for a while

627
00:41:08,015 --> 00:41:11,955
Speaker 3:  or if you subscribe to my newsletter called Installer Shameless Self-promotion,

628
00:41:12,255 --> 00:41:15,915
Speaker 3:  you know, I'm like way over my head deep into productivity

629
00:41:16,275 --> 00:41:19,675
Speaker 3:  software. I've used all the to-do apps, all the notes apps, all the calendars,

630
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:23,475
Speaker 3:  everything imaginable that claims it'll help me get

631
00:41:23,505 --> 00:41:27,195
Speaker 3:  more done and make my life better. And you can't spend

632
00:41:27,345 --> 00:41:31,195
Speaker 3:  much time in that corner of the internet without encountering this guy

633
00:41:31,425 --> 00:41:32,595
Speaker 3:  full name Ali Abdaal

634
00:41:32,735 --> 00:41:36,525
Speaker 12:  And I guess doctor turned entrepreneur and author. I dunno, maybe

635
00:41:36,525 --> 00:41:36,765
Speaker 12:  that

636
00:41:37,325 --> 00:41:41,205
Speaker 3:  Ali is right. He does do a lot of things. His YouTube channel is how I discovered

637
00:41:41,205 --> 00:41:42,605
Speaker 3:  him and I'm a big fan. Hey

638
00:41:42,605 --> 00:41:44,805
Speaker 12:  Friends, Welcome back to the channel in this video I wanna talk through

639
00:41:44,805 --> 00:41:47,965
Speaker 12:  seven habits that I try my best to do every day. And that saved me around

640
00:41:47,965 --> 00:41:49,325
Speaker 12:  three hours every single day.

641
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:53,645
Speaker 3:  Most recently, Ali wrote a book called Feel Good Productivity How to Do,

642
00:41:53,645 --> 00:41:56,845
Speaker 3:  More of What Matters To You. The book came out just this week and it's great

643
00:41:56,845 --> 00:42:00,285
Speaker 3:  and you should totally buy it and read it, but it is not at all what I expected.

644
00:42:00,725 --> 00:42:04,645
Speaker 3:  I expected the book to be all about cool tools and sick hacks and

645
00:42:04,645 --> 00:42:07,805
Speaker 3:  tips and tricks and systems for how to get more stuff done. After all, this

646
00:42:07,805 --> 00:42:11,445
Speaker 3:  is the guy who makes videos about his super complicated calendar system

647
00:42:11,785 --> 00:42:15,605
Speaker 3:  and the six AI tools he uses to increase productivity and how

648
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:18,645
Speaker 3:  to build your ultimate productivity system. He's done that kind of video

649
00:42:18,805 --> 00:42:22,605
Speaker 3:  a few times and it always does gangbusters numbers and in fact, Feel Good

650
00:42:22,605 --> 00:42:26,565
Speaker 3:  Productivity is almost the opposite of that. It's kind of a book about what

651
00:42:26,565 --> 00:42:30,365
Speaker 3:  makes this human as much as it is about how to be productive.

652
00:42:30,625 --> 00:42:34,325
Speaker 3:  And I got really curious about that combination of things and

653
00:42:34,325 --> 00:42:38,045
Speaker 3:  whether all the tools and apps and systems are even solving the right

654
00:42:38,085 --> 00:42:41,805
Speaker 3:  problems for us. I also figured this was a good time. We're three weeks into

655
00:42:41,805 --> 00:42:45,485
Speaker 3:  January, it's the beginning of a new year. This is, I think statistically

656
00:42:45,535 --> 00:42:49,245
Speaker 3:  right about the time most people ditch their New Year's resolutions. So it

657
00:42:49,245 --> 00:42:53,005
Speaker 3:  seemed like a fun time to talk about what it means to actually be productive

658
00:42:53,105 --> 00:42:56,485
Speaker 3:  and what it really takes. So I asked Ali to come on and tell me about writing

659
00:42:56,485 --> 00:43:00,245
Speaker 3:  the book, his productivity journey and a whole bunch more. We started with

660
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:03,805
Speaker 3:  one of the books Recurring themes, which is ironically the book itself.

661
00:43:04,745 --> 00:43:08,085
Speaker 3:  one of the things I like about the book is how much time in the book you

662
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,285
Speaker 3:  spend talking about the process of writing the book, which is a delightfully

663
00:43:11,285 --> 00:43:14,885
Speaker 3:  like Meta thing to do in a productivity book. It's like you, you could have

664
00:43:14,885 --> 00:43:17,245
Speaker 3:  kind of written the whole book about writing the whole book and it would've,

665
00:43:17,265 --> 00:43:20,405
Speaker 3:  it still would've sort of tracked, but I, I could feel it in the process

666
00:43:20,665 --> 00:43:24,205
Speaker 3:  of reading the book that it was like you took this thing

667
00:43:24,795 --> 00:43:28,685
Speaker 3:  seriously in a pretty unusual way that it was like, I wanna make a

668
00:43:28,685 --> 00:43:32,445
Speaker 3:  thing that lasts in a way that I think we're just not incentivized to do

669
00:43:32,445 --> 00:43:33,405
Speaker 3:  that on the internet most

670
00:43:33,405 --> 00:43:36,245
Speaker 12:  Of the time. No, exactly. Like everything on the internet is very, is very

671
00:43:36,245 --> 00:43:39,245
Speaker 12:  femoral. Yeah. Throughout the whole process I was like, ah, I wanna, I wanna

672
00:43:39,245 --> 00:43:42,325
Speaker 12:  take this seriously, but not too seriously to the point that it becomes

673
00:43:42,405 --> 00:43:45,805
Speaker 12:  paralyzing, but Right. Sincerely enough that, you know, I'm, I'm showing

674
00:43:45,805 --> 00:43:46,885
Speaker 12:  up and putting in my best effort.

675
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:49,805
Speaker 3:  Yeah, sincerely, not seriously one of the good lessons of the book. Exactly.

676
00:43:49,845 --> 00:43:52,405
Speaker 3:  I like that very much. Hang on. So part of the reason I wanted to talk to

677
00:43:52,405 --> 00:43:55,365
Speaker 3:  you about this is I feel like if I were to like boil the central thesis of

678
00:43:55,365 --> 00:43:59,165
Speaker 3:  your book down, it's that an underrated way to be productive is to make

679
00:43:59,165 --> 00:44:00,285
Speaker 3:  things more fun.

680
00:44:00,505 --> 00:44:01,285
Speaker 12:  That's literally it.

681
00:44:01,285 --> 00:44:04,125
Speaker 3:  There's a lot more to it and that's obviously like a massive generalization

682
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:07,365
Speaker 3:  of what you're saying, but I think that's like not a totally wrong takeaway

683
00:44:07,365 --> 00:44:08,565
Speaker 3:  from the book. Is that fair? That

684
00:44:08,565 --> 00:44:11,165
Speaker 12:  Is literally the, the thesis that we started the book with and the title

685
00:44:11,165 --> 00:44:13,565
Speaker 12:  initially was called Make It Fun. Oh

686
00:44:13,565 --> 00:44:13,885
Speaker 3:  There you go.

687
00:44:13,885 --> 00:44:17,765
Speaker 12:  Okay. Or like Fun, productive as Unproductive, fun, productive. It was like

688
00:44:17,765 --> 00:44:21,565
Speaker 12:  we played around with so many different titles. Eventually we kind of

689
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:25,285
Speaker 12:  realized that the word fun doesn't quite capture it and really like a lot

690
00:44:25,285 --> 00:44:28,245
Speaker 12:  of the science around it was this idea of feeling good and positive emotions.

691
00:44:28,445 --> 00:44:31,725
Speaker 12:  Hmm. And positive Emotions is not necessarily the same as fun, but to be

692
00:44:31,725 --> 00:44:34,285
Speaker 12:  honest it's close enough that I kind of equate them. And the way I think

693
00:44:34,285 --> 00:44:37,125
Speaker 12:  of it is, if you wanna be productive of anything, make it more fun and you'll

694
00:44:37,245 --> 00:44:39,605
Speaker 12:  probably be more productive at the thing and you'll also be happier along

695
00:44:39,605 --> 00:44:41,125
Speaker 12:  the way, which is win-win all round.

696
00:44:41,475 --> 00:44:45,005
Speaker 3:  Totally. So the thing that kept jumping out to me as I was reading it is

697
00:44:45,005 --> 00:44:48,805
Speaker 3:  so much of it is about framing and mindset and kind of the way that you talk

698
00:44:48,805 --> 00:44:51,205
Speaker 3:  to yourself and the way that you talk to other people and the way that you

699
00:44:51,405 --> 00:44:55,245
Speaker 3:  approach things and the process rather than kind of obsessing

700
00:44:55,245 --> 00:44:59,165
Speaker 3:  over just like raw data of how much you accomplish as

701
00:44:59,235 --> 00:45:02,725
Speaker 3:  sort of the end in itself. Which intellectually to me makes total sense,

702
00:45:02,725 --> 00:45:06,325
Speaker 3:  right? Like I, I believe every word in the book and it feels right. And yet

703
00:45:06,365 --> 00:45:09,965
Speaker 3:  I am a person who has spent an alarming amount of my life, like testing

704
00:45:09,965 --> 00:45:13,885
Speaker 3:  productivity tools, believing that I will find the right productivity

705
00:45:13,955 --> 00:45:17,925
Speaker 3:  tool that will solve all of my problems and magically work. And I

706
00:45:17,925 --> 00:45:20,765
Speaker 3:  kind of got to the end of your book and was like, okay, the correct answer

707
00:45:20,765 --> 00:45:24,005
Speaker 3:  here is to throw all of my technology into the ocean and

708
00:45:24,515 --> 00:45:28,245
Speaker 3:  rethink the way that I do everything. And you're also a guy who has spent

709
00:45:28,245 --> 00:45:32,085
Speaker 3:  an alarming amount of time testing Productivity tools. So like Square, square,

710
00:45:32,085 --> 00:45:34,525
Speaker 3:  those two things for me, those two sides of your brain.

711
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:38,605
Speaker 12:  Absolutely. So people have like various hot takes on this. Some people are

712
00:45:38,605 --> 00:45:42,045
Speaker 12:  like, you know, the tool really matters because the tool facilitates the

713
00:45:42,045 --> 00:45:44,965
Speaker 12:  productivity. Some people are like the tool doesn't matter at all because

714
00:45:45,005 --> 00:45:48,285
Speaker 12:  the tool is just a tool and any tool will do, whether it's Notion or Evernote

715
00:45:48,285 --> 00:45:52,125
Speaker 12:  or Google Keep or whatever the hell new apps city in Rome, et cetera, et

716
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:55,325
Speaker 12:  cetera, et cetera. My approach has always been that the tool that I will

717
00:45:55,345 --> 00:45:59,045
Speaker 12:  use is the one that feels good to use. This is why I still use Notion because

718
00:45:59,045 --> 00:46:02,525
Speaker 12:  Notion have done an amazing job of making it feel good to use Notion. The

719
00:46:02,625 --> 00:46:06,485
Speaker 12:  emojis, the font and the cover images between them make

720
00:46:06,485 --> 00:46:09,885
Speaker 12:  it a delight to use notion. The reason I use things three as my to-do list

721
00:46:09,885 --> 00:46:13,805
Speaker 12:  app is because the animations are delightful compared to Todoist, which

722
00:46:13,805 --> 00:46:17,565
Speaker 12:  is just a bit more like Todoist has more features teams and cross

723
00:46:17,805 --> 00:46:21,645
Speaker 12:  platform is all handy, but things is just so nice. And when we find

724
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:24,645
Speaker 12:  things that are nice to you, that's why people buy Apple products. They're

725
00:46:24,645 --> 00:46:28,165
Speaker 12:  just nice, something nice about them. Like when, for me, when an app feels

726
00:46:28,165 --> 00:46:31,125
Speaker 12:  good to use, I'm more likely to use it and therefore like that will make

727
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:33,725
Speaker 12:  me more productive. Totally. I dunno if you found this at all, like what's

728
00:46:33,725 --> 00:46:36,565
Speaker 12:  your take on the sort of the design aesthetics niceness of, of something?

729
00:46:36,905 --> 00:46:40,125
Speaker 3:  Oh no, I've, I've found that exactly. one of the notes I wrote down reading

730
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:43,685
Speaker 3:  the book was, I bet Ali loves people who design the hell outta their notion

731
00:46:43,685 --> 00:46:47,245
Speaker 3:  pages. Oh yeah, I think I'm right about that. But like it's, it's funny you

732
00:46:47,245 --> 00:46:50,565
Speaker 3:  mention things because it's one of those apps that is like objectively

733
00:46:51,065 --> 00:46:54,405
Speaker 3:  not what I need just in terms of like how my brain works and how I sort of

734
00:46:54,405 --> 00:46:58,125
Speaker 3:  run my days. It doesn't do it and yet every three months I try to force my

735
00:46:58,125 --> 00:47:01,725
Speaker 3:  life into things again because it's a lovely app with really nice animations,

736
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:05,765
Speaker 3:  it never crashes. It makes total sense. All the icons are beautiful.

737
00:47:05,765 --> 00:47:09,605
Speaker 3:  Like it, it feels really good and So I try to make myself use it. even that

738
00:47:09,765 --> 00:47:13,165
Speaker 3:  I know for sure it's never gonna work. I just like, I want to use it. And

739
00:47:13,165 --> 00:47:16,805
Speaker 3:  I think there's something to that. But I also think in this space it's

740
00:47:17,035 --> 00:47:20,925
Speaker 3:  very hard for any digital tool to do the

741
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:23,725
Speaker 3:  kind of thing that you're talking about. Early on in the book you talk a

742
00:47:23,725 --> 00:47:26,485
Speaker 3:  bunch about sort of making games out of everything and it's like how do we,

743
00:47:26,485 --> 00:47:28,725
Speaker 3:  how do we gamify things? And we went through this whole phase on the internet

744
00:47:28,725 --> 00:47:31,645
Speaker 3:  of like, how do we gamify everything? And sometimes It works and sometimes

745
00:47:31,675 --> 00:47:35,445
Speaker 3:  it's like disastrous because you try to gamify things that shouldn't be

746
00:47:35,445 --> 00:47:39,245
Speaker 3:  gamified and it gets really ugly and and problematic. But I think also

747
00:47:39,515 --> 00:47:42,885
Speaker 3:  it's very hard for these digital tools to be

748
00:47:43,075 --> 00:47:47,045
Speaker 3:  whimsical and fun and still useful. And So

749
00:47:47,045 --> 00:47:49,645
Speaker 3:  I think we've gotten to this point where with so many things where we've

750
00:47:49,645 --> 00:47:52,885
Speaker 3:  like leaned into like obsidian is like pure

751
00:47:53,425 --> 00:47:57,365
Speaker 3:  raw utility, right? Like yeah, there's nothing delightful about it,

752
00:47:57,425 --> 00:48:00,405
Speaker 3:  but it is like, holy God, if you wanna get things done, will it help you

753
00:48:00,405 --> 00:48:03,765
Speaker 3:  get things done in a certain way? And I guess notions may be an interesting

754
00:48:03,915 --> 00:48:06,685
Speaker 3:  outlier there and I wonder if that's part of why it's been so successful.

755
00:48:06,685 --> 00:48:10,005
Speaker 3:  But part of what I wonder is like the principles that you talk about in this

756
00:48:10,005 --> 00:48:13,805
Speaker 3:  book, like can those exist in the kinds of like productivity apps?

757
00:48:13,805 --> 00:48:15,245
Speaker 3:  You and I spend too much time thinking about.

758
00:48:15,595 --> 00:48:18,965
Speaker 12:  Yeah. And I think some apps have tried it like, fabulous. Did you come across

759
00:48:18,965 --> 00:48:20,205
Speaker 12:  that habit tracker fabulous.

760
00:48:20,585 --> 00:48:20,805
Speaker 3:  No,

761
00:48:20,945 --> 00:48:23,365
Speaker 12:  It was like a to-do list, but you would like build different habits into

762
00:48:23,365 --> 00:48:26,525
Speaker 12:  it. It's like you'd start off with a drink my water first thing in the morning

763
00:48:26,545 --> 00:48:30,525
Speaker 12:  and then like do my morning routine. And that was so full on on

764
00:48:30,525 --> 00:48:34,045
Speaker 12:  the design and cute animations and stuff all the way, but to the point that

765
00:48:34,045 --> 00:48:37,085
Speaker 12:  it was almost unusable because everything then took ages to be like a nice

766
00:48:37,085 --> 00:48:39,965
Speaker 12:  little delightful animation. So, I dunno, like a notion is an exception

767
00:48:39,965 --> 00:48:43,085
Speaker 12:  in that they somehow cracked the, the niceness thing. But for other apps

768
00:48:43,205 --> 00:48:46,045
Speaker 12:  it's really hard. Wonderlist back in the day was quite delightful. And then

769
00:48:46,045 --> 00:48:47,445
Speaker 12:  yeah, it it sort of died.

770
00:48:48,155 --> 00:48:50,245
Speaker 3:  Yeah, RIP Wonderlist was a good example.

771
00:48:50,655 --> 00:48:53,405
Speaker 12:  Inbox by Gmail was quite delightful. And then, and then it died. Well

772
00:48:53,405 --> 00:48:56,685
Speaker 3:  That's the thing, right? And I think the path a lot of these end up on is,

773
00:48:56,945 --> 00:49:00,005
Speaker 3:  and I've, I'd love following to-do list apps because they all go through

774
00:49:00,005 --> 00:49:03,605
Speaker 3:  the same thing where it's like everybody has sort of one thing, one idea

775
00:49:03,665 --> 00:49:07,485
Speaker 3:  or one mechanic or one sort of feature that makes them unusual and then people

776
00:49:07,485 --> 00:49:09,965
Speaker 3:  start to use it and they say, well, but I also need this feature and I need

777
00:49:09,965 --> 00:49:12,285
Speaker 3:  recurring tasks. And what if you had calendar integration and I really wanna

778
00:49:12,285 --> 00:49:15,565
Speaker 3:  take notes and I do my things this way, I need a priority system. And all

779
00:49:15,565 --> 00:49:19,445
Speaker 3:  of a sudden you've just built this like awful voltron of an app that does

780
00:49:19,445 --> 00:49:23,005
Speaker 3:  everything and is a mess in the same way that almost every other

781
00:49:23,005 --> 00:49:26,525
Speaker 3:  productivity app is a mess. And then that's when I get to the point where

782
00:49:26,525 --> 00:49:29,645
Speaker 3:  I'm like, okay, I need out, this is too much. This is making me feel bad.

783
00:49:29,785 --> 00:49:32,565
Speaker 3:  I'm like spending my life managing this system rather than actually accomplishing

784
00:49:32,765 --> 00:49:34,845
Speaker 3:  anything. And then I go find another app and go through exactly the same

785
00:49:34,845 --> 00:49:35,085
Speaker 3:  process.

786
00:49:35,315 --> 00:49:39,165
Speaker 12:  Yeah. Th this is like my life for the last 10 years, every few months.

787
00:49:40,225 --> 00:49:44,125
Speaker 3:  Do you feel like writing this book has changed the way you think about all

788
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:48,005
Speaker 3:  of that stuff? Like do you approach new productivity apps and

789
00:49:48,005 --> 00:49:50,605
Speaker 3:  stuff differently? I went back through your YouTube channel and tried to

790
00:49:50,605 --> 00:49:53,725
Speaker 3:  see if I could pinpoint like when you were working hard on the book based

791
00:49:53,725 --> 00:49:57,005
Speaker 3:  on how much you were talking about Productivity tools and I feel like I can

792
00:49:57,005 --> 00:50:00,125
Speaker 3:  sort of invent a narrative there, but I am curious like, did you have that

793
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:03,285
Speaker 3:  experience? Like do you find yourself switching less or caring less or trying

794
00:50:03,285 --> 00:50:06,045
Speaker 3:  new things less because you're like, actually the the tool matters a little

795
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:08,125
Speaker 3:  less than maybe I've thought over the years. Yeah,

796
00:50:08,555 --> 00:50:11,685
Speaker 12:  I've really come to that realization over time that the tool is almost meaningless

797
00:50:11,685 --> 00:50:14,405
Speaker 12:  other than the fact that someone nicer to use than others. We're actually

798
00:50:14,405 --> 00:50:18,245
Speaker 12:  working on a sort of productivity course to release in 2024 with like

799
00:50:18,365 --> 00:50:21,925
Speaker 12:  a community and a coaching program behind it. And that

800
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:25,485
Speaker 12:  has involved diving into a bunch of research around like goal setting and

801
00:50:25,485 --> 00:50:29,445
Speaker 12:  things like that. And a big goal for this course, which is why

802
00:50:29,445 --> 00:50:32,565
Speaker 12:  I'm, I'm thinking a lot about this stuff, is for it to be platform agnostic.

803
00:50:32,585 --> 00:50:35,205
Speaker 12:  Mm. I've come up with a bit of a, I'm, you know, be, I'd be curious to get

804
00:50:35,205 --> 00:50:37,965
Speaker 12:  your take on this a little sort of frame framework for productivity, which

805
00:50:37,965 --> 00:50:40,125
Speaker 12:  is, which is not in the book, but you know, who cares about talking about

806
00:50:40,125 --> 00:50:43,725
Speaker 12:  the book, which sort of stands for it's GPS goal plan

807
00:50:43,905 --> 00:50:47,565
Speaker 12:  system. That's what all the productivity boils down to have a goal that

808
00:50:47,565 --> 00:50:50,525
Speaker 12:  gives you a sort of destination to go towards, make a plan of how you're

809
00:50:50,525 --> 00:50:53,125
Speaker 12:  gonna get there, and then have a system that encourages you to actually

810
00:50:53,125 --> 00:50:56,965
Speaker 12:  follow the plan and then you adjust accordingly. Goal plan system GPS,

811
00:50:57,265 --> 00:51:00,605
Speaker 12:  and I've been kind of doing sort of informal productivity coaching for like

812
00:51:00,605 --> 00:51:03,725
Speaker 12:  friends and my team and stuff. And it always comes down to that if, if someone

813
00:51:03,925 --> 00:51:06,325
Speaker 12:  wants to be more productive, should have a goal, should have a plan, should

814
00:51:06,325 --> 00:51:08,845
Speaker 12:  have a system. And if someone is struggling with their productivity, it

815
00:51:08,845 --> 00:51:12,165
Speaker 12:  is almost always a problem with either the goal or the plan or the system.

816
00:51:12,825 --> 00:51:15,845
Speaker 12:  I'm trying to figure out a way of like presenting that in a way that, in

817
00:51:15,845 --> 00:51:19,365
Speaker 12:  a way that does, it's not like do this in notion or do this in OneNote or

818
00:51:19,365 --> 00:51:22,445
Speaker 12:  it's like do this in whatever you want used to p pen and paper use post-it

819
00:51:22,605 --> 00:51:25,605
Speaker 12:  notes use notion for like hair. The point is if you have a goal, you have

820
00:51:25,605 --> 00:51:27,605
Speaker 12:  a plan on a system, there's no way you're not gonna be productive.

821
00:51:28,265 --> 00:51:31,765
Speaker 3:  The great challenge I have had with like Capital P

822
00:51:31,765 --> 00:51:35,685
Speaker 3:  productivity internet people over the years has been that I think everything

823
00:51:35,685 --> 00:51:38,965
Speaker 3:  you just said is absolutely true and makes for terrible content, which is

824
00:51:39,065 --> 00:51:41,845
Speaker 3:  the challenge, right? And I think I, I was talking to somebody not that long

825
00:51:41,845 --> 00:51:45,805
Speaker 3:  ago about why Notion grew this huge community and I think

826
00:51:45,835 --> 00:51:48,845
Speaker 3:  it's partly, it's a very successful app because it's a very good app and

827
00:51:49,275 --> 00:51:53,125
Speaker 3:  also it is a very fun thing to tinker with and make

828
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:56,285
Speaker 3:  beautiful things with that you can share on the internet, right? Like notion

829
00:51:56,905 --> 00:52:00,725
Speaker 3:  allows for better YouTube videos than a text file.

830
00:52:01,025 --> 00:52:03,845
Speaker 3:  And that has nothing to do with whether or not it's a better app, but it,

831
00:52:03,845 --> 00:52:07,685
Speaker 3:  it is a better thing to make content about and I think so is

832
00:52:07,825 --> 00:52:11,645
Speaker 3:  really elaborate systems. So is, you know, coming up with things that you

833
00:52:11,645 --> 00:52:14,445
Speaker 3:  can sell courses about. And I think I'm as guilty of this as anybody, like

834
00:52:14,445 --> 00:52:17,845
Speaker 3:  I've spent a lot of time writing about and covering apps that

835
00:52:18,005 --> 00:52:21,845
Speaker 3:  purport to solve everything when in reality, like I find myself sending a

836
00:52:21,845 --> 00:52:24,605
Speaker 3:  lot of people this blog post, I forget the guy who wrote it, but he's like,

837
00:52:24,605 --> 00:52:28,565
Speaker 3:  my productivity system is a single text file. And he's like, I have a 15,000

838
00:52:28,755 --> 00:52:32,685
Speaker 3:  word long text file that is just, I write down all the things I have to

839
00:52:32,685 --> 00:52:35,965
Speaker 3:  do that day and then I do them. And it's like, oh shit, maybe it's that simple.

840
00:52:36,385 --> 00:52:40,205
Speaker 3:  But I, I do wonder like we're, we're in this place now where trying to

841
00:52:40,235 --> 00:52:43,605
Speaker 3:  make, you know, quote unquote content about this stuff

842
00:52:44,095 --> 00:52:47,565
Speaker 3:  feels almost disingenuous. If the goal is just know where you're going

843
00:52:48,105 --> 00:52:50,805
Speaker 3:  and figure out how to get there, like that's so much simpler and so much

844
00:52:50,805 --> 00:52:53,165
Speaker 3:  less sort of visually compelling in a certain way.

845
00:52:53,885 --> 00:52:57,725
Speaker 12:  I know, you know, one person who I've really been vibing with his stuff

846
00:52:57,965 --> 00:53:01,805
Speaker 12:  recently, Ramit Seti has been doing a whole new new thing on YouTube.

847
00:53:01,985 --> 00:53:04,365
Speaker 12:  He actually took my course on how to do YouTube and I connected with his

848
00:53:04,365 --> 00:53:07,165
Speaker 12:  team and stuff and now he's crushing it on YouTube. But one thing that he's

849
00:53:07,165 --> 00:53:10,765
Speaker 12:  doing, he's, he's doing just like long form conversations with people who

850
00:53:10,765 --> 00:53:13,245
Speaker 12:  are struggling with their finances and they're just like sharing their screen

851
00:53:13,245 --> 00:53:16,645
Speaker 12:  and going through their numbers and it's all the same simple stuff. Like

852
00:53:17,055 --> 00:53:20,845
Speaker 12:  don't spend more than you earn and like put stuff in investment

853
00:53:20,845 --> 00:53:24,725
Speaker 12:  accounts and like don't spend so much on a car payment for your truck that

854
00:53:24,725 --> 00:53:27,685
Speaker 12:  you can't afford. Basic stuff like that. That was in his book I'll Teach

855
00:53:27,685 --> 00:53:31,365
Speaker 12:  You To Be Rich. But there's something a about watching him coach a

856
00:53:31,435 --> 00:53:35,125
Speaker 12:  real couple through these problems and seeing how they deal with it. That's,

857
00:53:35,125 --> 00:53:38,325
Speaker 12:  I'm, I'm just hooked on this content even that I know exactly what the system

858
00:53:38,325 --> 00:53:40,565
Speaker 12:  is from the book and you know, I'm fairly familiar with personal finance,

859
00:53:40,875 --> 00:53:44,085
Speaker 12:  he's just really cool watching him like coach people through it. And so

860
00:53:44,145 --> 00:53:47,325
Speaker 12:  I'm thinking, hmm, maybe there's something there instead of, you know, for

861
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:50,245
Speaker 12:  me when when I think of the future of my content, instead of it being like

862
00:53:50,385 --> 00:53:53,925
Speaker 12:  let me try and invent some new productivity system that looks good on a

863
00:53:54,085 --> 00:53:57,565
Speaker 12:  fricking YouTube video, more like, hey, let's just get someone on a call

864
00:53:57,565 --> 00:54:00,045
Speaker 12:  and coach them through how to set goals, how to make a plan and how to build

865
00:54:00,085 --> 00:54:04,045
Speaker 12:  a system. And it will converge on the same things. It will converge on

866
00:54:04,225 --> 00:54:07,485
Speaker 12:  figure out roughly what you wanna do with your life. Turn it into a few

867
00:54:07,485 --> 00:54:11,165
Speaker 12:  goals for the year. Let's break them down, let's put it in the calendar

868
00:54:11,505 --> 00:54:15,405
Speaker 12:  and let's review it every now and then. But actually the process of doing

869
00:54:15,405 --> 00:54:19,325
Speaker 12:  that requires a lot of coaching for some people and needs emotions get

870
00:54:19,325 --> 00:54:23,045
Speaker 12:  in the way like fear gets in the way. There's like so much cool stuff but

871
00:54:23,045 --> 00:54:26,005
Speaker 12:  I think the cool stuff is in the human emotion behind it rather than in

872
00:54:26,005 --> 00:54:27,805
Speaker 12:  the how pretty is my notion page.

873
00:54:28,035 --> 00:54:30,605
Speaker 3:  Yeah and there's something too like I don't mean to denigrate people who

874
00:54:30,605 --> 00:54:33,285
Speaker 3:  have pretty notion pages. Like there is something too, like you said, if

875
00:54:33,285 --> 00:54:36,245
Speaker 3:  you're a pretty good notion page makes you use notion more like that's a

876
00:54:36,245 --> 00:54:39,565
Speaker 3:  victory, right? Like that is a thing that is successful and my problem is,

877
00:54:39,585 --> 00:54:42,085
Speaker 3:  the reason I switched productivity apps all the time I discovered is that

878
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:45,565
Speaker 3:  I just get bored with them. And so I've actually come to take the inevitable

879
00:54:45,565 --> 00:54:48,605
Speaker 3:  switching, I literally just did this yesterday, like took all of my notes

880
00:54:48,665 --> 00:54:52,325
Speaker 3:  out of one app and put them in another app, which is an unbelievable waste

881
00:54:52,325 --> 00:54:56,125
Speaker 3:  of time. Like it's just such a bad use of time and energy. But every

882
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:59,165
Speaker 3:  single time I like the system gets a little different. It's essentially a

883
00:54:59,165 --> 00:55:02,005
Speaker 3:  way to like look at all my notes again. I get to sort of move stuff around,

884
00:55:02,125 --> 00:55:04,765
Speaker 3:  I take some things out, I put some new things in and I've come to see that

885
00:55:04,825 --> 00:55:08,805
Speaker 3:  as like I'm switching apps but also sort of reviewing everything that

886
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:12,725
Speaker 3:  I have and whatever it takes to get there is a win. But I, I think that's

887
00:55:12,725 --> 00:55:16,365
Speaker 3:  right that it all of this is in some ways simpler and in some ways

888
00:55:16,435 --> 00:55:19,965
Speaker 3:  more complex than it is made out to be. And and it's an interesting thing

889
00:55:19,985 --> 00:55:23,685
Speaker 3:  for you as a person who people like look to for advice to be like, here are

890
00:55:23,685 --> 00:55:27,485
Speaker 3:  ways you can do this, but ultimately like this is about your feelings. It's

891
00:55:27,485 --> 00:55:31,285
Speaker 3:  just a very funny kind of line to have to walk as someone who is

892
00:55:31,285 --> 00:55:34,765
Speaker 3:  trying to guide people and especially for you like a mass audience of millions

893
00:55:34,765 --> 00:55:36,405
Speaker 3:  of people through that process.

894
00:55:37,035 --> 00:55:37,325
Speaker 12:  Yeah,

895
00:55:37,325 --> 00:55:39,885
Speaker 3:  You're like an internet therapist in a lot of ways. I

896
00:55:39,885 --> 00:55:42,525
Speaker 12:  Know exactly. Like I, I genuinely never thought the conclusion for any of

897
00:55:42,525 --> 00:55:45,165
Speaker 12:  this would be, it's about your feelings. But the three years of research

898
00:55:45,265 --> 00:55:48,885
Speaker 12:  around the book made me really realize, oh crap, it really is just about

899
00:55:48,885 --> 00:55:52,765
Speaker 12:  the feelings. And if you can deal with the feelings then honestly productivity's

900
00:55:52,765 --> 00:55:56,605
Speaker 12:  as simple as I write down what I need to do and then I do it. It's just

901
00:55:56,605 --> 00:55:58,045
Speaker 12:  that the feelings get in the way of that.

902
00:55:59,145 --> 00:56:02,245
Speaker 3:  One of the things that you mentioned with the CEO coach and I think is is

903
00:56:02,245 --> 00:56:05,525
Speaker 3:  true about a bunch of stuff in your book is how valuable a lot of this stuff

904
00:56:05,525 --> 00:56:09,045
Speaker 3:  is to do in person. Whether it's like giving feedback or

905
00:56:09,545 --> 00:56:12,845
Speaker 3:  the, you talk about kinda the random acts of kindness that you can do or

906
00:56:12,875 --> 00:56:16,085
Speaker 3:  receive and how meaningful that can be in productivity and all this stuff.

907
00:56:16,105 --> 00:56:19,485
Speaker 3:  And I think my experience has been that that is sort of obviously true that

908
00:56:19,765 --> 00:56:23,485
Speaker 3:  a lot of things that matter and are meaningful happen

909
00:56:23,835 --> 00:56:27,005
Speaker 3:  when you're in a room with somebody. But that's also just increasingly not

910
00:56:27,005 --> 00:56:29,605
Speaker 3:  the world we live in. Like you and I are doing this podcast, we're thousands

911
00:56:29,605 --> 00:56:32,925
Speaker 3:  of miles away from each other, this is the world we live in. Can this stuff

912
00:56:32,995 --> 00:56:36,125
Speaker 3:  work in a sort of digital space? Like I keep coming back to the idea that

913
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:39,325
Speaker 3:  like I agree with so many of the ideals in your book and I think they run

914
00:56:39,355 --> 00:56:42,685
Speaker 3:  into what it means to be a person in the world in

915
00:56:42,685 --> 00:56:46,165
Speaker 3:  2023 and 2024 in these really complicated

916
00:56:46,395 --> 00:56:49,245
Speaker 3:  ways. Like can we get that stuff through digital tools?

917
00:56:49,675 --> 00:56:52,885
Speaker 12:  Yeah, I think we can definitely get some of it. one of my favorite things

918
00:56:52,885 --> 00:56:55,885
Speaker 12:  to do is to work in an environment where there are other people working,

919
00:56:56,215 --> 00:56:59,845
Speaker 12:  which is why right now I'm in a WeWork rather than in my hotel room. 'cause

920
00:56:59,845 --> 00:57:02,725
Speaker 12:  I find it very depressing just working in a hotel room. But during, during

921
00:57:02,725 --> 00:57:05,765
Speaker 12:  the pandemic when all of these coworking spaces were closed, I found this

922
00:57:06,085 --> 00:57:10,045
Speaker 12:  writer's group that would just meet on Zoom four times a day for like an

923
00:57:10,045 --> 00:57:13,005
Speaker 12:  hour and it was so nice. It was like, I think it's still going a London

924
00:57:13,005 --> 00:57:16,125
Speaker 12:  writer's salon and it's just sick. Like, you know, it's like a zoom call

925
00:57:16,125 --> 00:57:18,645
Speaker 12:  with a few hundred writers. They spent five minutes at the start giving

926
00:57:18,645 --> 00:57:21,605
Speaker 12:  you a motivational quote five minutes at the end. Everyone's like posting

927
00:57:21,625 --> 00:57:24,645
Speaker 12:  in the chat what they accomplished. There genuinely is a feeling of community

928
00:57:24,745 --> 00:57:27,725
Speaker 12:  in being on a Zoom call with a couple hundred people and like all working

929
00:57:27,745 --> 00:57:31,165
Speaker 12:  on the same general thing. So I think that definitely works. I think similarly,

930
00:57:31,625 --> 00:57:33,765
Speaker 12:  you know, our team has just gone remote because they've decided to travel

931
00:57:33,765 --> 00:57:36,645
Speaker 12:  the world previously we were in person and so we've been trying to figure

932
00:57:36,705 --> 00:57:39,845
Speaker 12:  out like, okay, how do we apply these principles of like how do we make

933
00:57:39,845 --> 00:57:43,365
Speaker 12:  work feel good in a remote world? Even like, like simple stuff. Like we

934
00:57:43,365 --> 00:57:46,445
Speaker 12:  have a, we have a channel on Slack now for like nice comments that we say

935
00:57:46,445 --> 00:57:49,725
Speaker 12:  to each other or nice comments that we post from you know, people in our

936
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:53,205
Speaker 12:  audience and emails that we get. And we didn't really have that before because

937
00:57:53,225 --> 00:57:57,205
Speaker 12:  we were in person. But now the fact that there is a Slack channel dedicated

938
00:57:57,225 --> 00:58:00,845
Speaker 12:  for pleasantries and feedback and nice things, it's kind of cute

939
00:58:01,105 --> 00:58:04,285
Speaker 12:  and we've got this like matter app on Slack that gives you points and you

940
00:58:04,285 --> 00:58:07,565
Speaker 12:  can redeem them for a Starbucks gift card and it's just, you know this something

941
00:58:07,565 --> 00:58:08,485
Speaker 12:  about that. That's kind of nice.

942
00:58:08,715 --> 00:58:11,485
Speaker 3:  Does that stuff work for you as a person? It

943
00:58:11,485 --> 00:58:15,245
Speaker 12:  Really does, yeah. Honestly I love it. I love that shit. Like I used to

944
00:58:15,245 --> 00:58:19,005
Speaker 12:  be skeptical of motivational quotes and I used to be skeptical of affirmations

945
00:58:19,005 --> 00:58:22,565
Speaker 12:  and stuff but I think as I've gotten older I've realized the value

946
00:58:22,825 --> 00:58:26,805
Speaker 12:  of reminders. You know, even something like, you know back in

947
00:58:26,805 --> 00:58:29,485
Speaker 12:  the day when I had a computer monitor I used to have a post-it note, what

948
00:58:29,485 --> 00:58:33,245
Speaker 12:  would this look like if it were fun just written on it. And

949
00:58:33,645 --> 00:58:36,685
Speaker 12:  I think in the past I would've sort of scoffed that thinking like, the fuck,

950
00:58:36,715 --> 00:58:39,845
Speaker 12:  like how would that be helpful? And it's actually a really helpful reminder

951
00:58:39,945 --> 00:58:42,365
Speaker 12:  if you ask yourself what would this look like if it were fun? It's like,

952
00:58:42,365 --> 00:58:45,205
Speaker 12:  oh I'd probably take it a bit less seriously 'cause it's not that deep.

953
00:58:45,845 --> 00:58:48,325
Speaker 12:  Hmm. Haven't got any music in the background. Lemme put on concerning habits

954
00:58:48,325 --> 00:58:51,085
Speaker 12:  from Lord of the Rings. 'cause that'll always like, you know, cracks me

955
00:58:51,285 --> 00:58:54,285
Speaker 12:  up. It's a vibe. Oh I haven't said hello to some someone in my team in a

956
00:58:54,285 --> 00:58:56,845
Speaker 12:  while. Lemme just go say hello and sort of give 'em a little massage in

957
00:58:56,845 --> 00:58:59,605
Speaker 12:  a non weird way. I haven't said a nice message to someone on the team today

958
00:58:59,765 --> 00:59:02,205
Speaker 12:  'cause you know, as A-C-E-O-I should do that. So lemme just do that. And

959
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,765
Speaker 12:  it's like, great, now I'm getting back into my work. but it feels more fun.

960
00:59:04,865 --> 00:59:07,405
Speaker 12:  So I love, I love little reminders like that. I'm a sucker for emotion,

961
00:59:07,405 --> 00:59:08,245
Speaker 12:  motivational quotes.

962
00:59:08,825 --> 00:59:11,965
Speaker 3:  The part of the book that resonated with me the most actually was the part

963
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,445
Speaker 3:  at the very beginning where you're like, look, everybody talks about discipline

964
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:18,045
Speaker 3:  and everybody talks about this idea that sometimes you don't wanna do things

965
00:59:18,045 --> 00:59:21,285
Speaker 3:  and you should just do them anyway. And that's all well and good, but also

966
00:59:21,285 --> 00:59:25,245
Speaker 3:  like screw that. Like that's sometimes you have to do things

967
00:59:25,245 --> 00:59:28,885
Speaker 3:  you don't wanna do. Like sure that's life, but what if there were fewer of

968
00:59:28,885 --> 00:59:31,045
Speaker 3:  those things? Like that's what this book is about. And I was like, that's

969
00:59:31,045 --> 00:59:34,245
Speaker 3:  such like, thank you for that because there's so many and so much of the

970
00:59:34,245 --> 00:59:38,085
Speaker 3:  like hustle culture of the internet is like 24 hours a day just

971
00:59:38,085 --> 00:59:41,605
Speaker 3:  get it done. No excuses play like a champ and it's just like, it's just boring

972
00:59:41,705 --> 00:59:44,805
Speaker 3:  and I'm tired and I don't want to like leave me alone. Yeah,

973
00:59:45,025 --> 00:59:45,245
Speaker 12:  And

974
00:59:45,285 --> 00:59:48,725
Speaker 3:  I think I'm guessing that was intentional because if you've read all the

975
00:59:48,725 --> 00:59:52,045
Speaker 3:  productivity books that it seems you have read, you've heard that message

976
00:59:52,075 --> 00:59:55,485
Speaker 3:  more times than most, which is just like, shut up, do the work and like buy

977
00:59:55,485 --> 00:59:59,205
Speaker 3:  this supplement and you'll win. Mm. And I think that is

978
00:59:59,645 --> 01:00:03,525
Speaker 3:  a bleak world to live in and I feel like your version of the world is

979
01:00:03,525 --> 01:00:05,125
Speaker 3:  significantly less bleak on purpose.

980
01:00:05,675 --> 01:00:09,285
Speaker 12:  Yeah, I think I've, I've benefited a lot from, you know, as partly through

981
01:00:09,285 --> 01:00:12,205
Speaker 12:  the journey of having this YouTube channel. I just happen to connect with

982
01:00:12,535 --> 01:00:16,285
Speaker 12:  loads of people who are like really rich and really like, sort of business

983
01:00:16,405 --> 01:00:20,325
Speaker 12:  successful. Like deca millionaires, a hundred millionaires. I've,

984
01:00:20,525 --> 01:00:24,245
Speaker 12:  hmm, only I've met two billionaires and I love asking them for advice because

985
01:00:24,305 --> 01:00:27,525
Speaker 12:  I'm always like, okay, this is cool, cool shit. I I I get to hang out with

986
01:00:27,525 --> 01:00:30,645
Speaker 12:  people who are like way further ahead of me in their careers and also stupidly

987
01:00:30,645 --> 01:00:34,125
Speaker 12:  rich and like let me just ask them for life advice. And basically all of

988
01:00:34,125 --> 01:00:37,325
Speaker 12:  them sacrifice to their health and relationships and wellbeing for the sake

989
01:00:37,325 --> 01:00:40,565
Speaker 12:  of growing their business. Yep. And literally all of them regret doing that.

990
01:00:40,585 --> 01:00:43,085
Speaker 12:  And they're always like, bro, you know, if there's one thing you do, trust

991
01:00:43,085 --> 01:00:46,885
Speaker 12:  me, like rec recognize when enough is enough, don't sacrifice your family

992
01:00:46,945 --> 01:00:49,245
Speaker 12:  and your health and your wellbeing for the sake of growing your business

993
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:51,405
Speaker 12:  because it's not actually gonna make you happy. Even that you think it will

994
01:00:51,705 --> 01:00:54,605
Speaker 12:  to have some balance. Man I wish someone had told me about this before.

995
01:00:54,605 --> 01:00:57,605
Speaker 12:  Have some balance. Do all this stuff, enjoy the journey. The journey is

996
01:00:57,605 --> 01:01:00,805
Speaker 12:  the destination, the the goal's not gonna make you happy. The journey makes

997
01:01:00,805 --> 01:01:04,205
Speaker 12:  you happy. And I've just been hearing that. So I've been reading books about

998
01:01:04,205 --> 01:01:06,605
Speaker 12:  it, reading all the, the stuff about it and hearing it enough times from

999
01:01:06,605 --> 01:01:10,525
Speaker 12:  people to, I think I really have absorbed it into my heart. So my

1000
01:01:10,525 --> 01:01:13,645
Speaker 12:  whole thing these days is like, no achievement is actually gonna make you

1001
01:01:13,645 --> 01:01:16,325
Speaker 12:  happy. The thing that's gonna make you happy and feel content is having

1002
01:01:16,325 --> 01:01:19,605
Speaker 12:  that balanced life where you're enjoying the journey. So why not start now

1003
01:01:19,625 --> 01:01:23,045
Speaker 12:  rather than when you hit some arbitrary income milestone or whatever the

1004
01:01:23,045 --> 01:01:23,405
Speaker 12:  thing might be.

1005
01:01:23,705 --> 01:01:26,965
Speaker 3:  So, and speaking of that, actually one of the things you mentioned in the

1006
01:01:26,965 --> 01:01:29,205
Speaker 3:  book that I've been thinking about ever since is this idea of like adding

1007
01:01:29,645 --> 01:01:33,285
Speaker 3:  friction deliberately to your life. And as somebody who covers software,

1008
01:01:33,285 --> 01:01:35,805
Speaker 3:  this is a thing I've been thinking a lot about, like, especially in this

1009
01:01:35,805 --> 01:01:39,685
Speaker 3:  age of social media and stuff, right? Like we spent a whole generation

1010
01:01:40,445 --> 01:01:43,405
Speaker 3:  removing friction from everything, right? We made it really easy to connect

1011
01:01:43,405 --> 01:01:45,685
Speaker 3:  with people, we made it really easy for people to track everything. We made

1012
01:01:45,685 --> 01:01:49,085
Speaker 3:  it really easy to do everything online and we like kind of broke society

1013
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:53,285
Speaker 3:  in the process. And now I, the more people I talk to, the more they're

1014
01:01:53,285 --> 01:01:56,725
Speaker 3:  like, well what if we made shopping a little harder? Like what if, what if

1015
01:01:57,005 --> 01:02:00,565
Speaker 3:  shipping was slower? Like maybe, maybe that would suck, but also be better.

1016
01:02:00,585 --> 01:02:03,885
Speaker 3:  But I think we've hit a point where that's really, it's just hard to put

1017
01:02:03,885 --> 01:02:07,525
Speaker 3:  the toothpaste back in the tube in that front. And I think the people who

1018
01:02:07,525 --> 01:02:10,925
Speaker 3:  do things like you described in the book, like buy feature phones on purpose

1019
01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:14,845
Speaker 3:  are like, there's a world in which they're like smart forward thinkers and

1020
01:02:14,845 --> 01:02:18,205
Speaker 3:  there's a world in which they're like borderline insane people. I guess I

1021
01:02:18,205 --> 01:02:21,445
Speaker 3:  wonder like for you, you as somebody who, who is both sort of writing about

1022
01:02:21,445 --> 01:02:25,165
Speaker 3:  this for an audience and trying to live it yourself, do you have a good sense

1023
01:02:25,165 --> 01:02:28,725
Speaker 3:  of the balance there of like we have, we have so many tools that make it

1024
01:02:28,725 --> 01:02:31,765
Speaker 3:  easy to do so many things. Smartphones are so good for so many purposes.

1025
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:34,805
Speaker 3:  There's all these upsides to all these things. Like the friction that the,

1026
01:02:34,865 --> 01:02:38,805
Speaker 3:  the avoidance of friction that helped you get a giant audience is also

1027
01:02:38,825 --> 01:02:42,525
Speaker 3:  the avoidance of friction that is a problem for a lot of people

1028
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:45,885
Speaker 3:  trying to like successfully live their lives. Do you have a sense of kind

1029
01:02:45,885 --> 01:02:47,605
Speaker 3:  of how to walk that line the right way?

1030
01:02:48,155 --> 01:02:51,365
Speaker 12:  Yeah, I think I struggle with this like everyone else, the thing that I

1031
01:02:51,365 --> 01:02:55,285
Speaker 12:  think I I always bring it back down to is intentionality. So I

1032
01:02:55,285 --> 01:02:58,405
Speaker 12:  have no qualms about spending time on social media 'cause I also do it for

1033
01:02:58,405 --> 01:03:02,165
Speaker 12:  a job. But one thing I found enormously helpful is just getting rid of all

1034
01:03:02,165 --> 01:03:05,365
Speaker 12:  of all social media apps from my home screen. 'cause before I would just

1035
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:08,645
Speaker 12:  sort of swipe, swipe open up Twitter and scroll and

1036
01:03:08,945 --> 01:03:12,725
Speaker 12:  almost do that on autopilot with that, even thinking about it. Now the way

1037
01:03:12,725 --> 01:03:15,885
Speaker 12:  I open up Twitter is I scroll down on my phone, I type in Twitter, I realize

1038
01:03:15,885 --> 01:03:18,885
Speaker 12:  it's not called Twitter anymore and I type in X and then I go on the thing.

1039
01:03:19,305 --> 01:03:22,805
Speaker 12:  And that's enough friction for me to be like, I have to intentionally decide

1040
01:03:22,805 --> 01:03:25,325
Speaker 12:  to go on Twitter. For me to actually go on Twitter. It's not just to click

1041
01:03:25,325 --> 01:03:28,485
Speaker 12:  on my phone. The things that are clicks on my phone are Kindle Audible,

1042
01:03:28,785 --> 01:03:32,245
Speaker 12:  UAC day one, a new app that I've just released called Voice Pal, which is

1043
01:03:32,245 --> 01:03:35,925
Speaker 12:  like voice notes for steroids and like my workout tracker. So it's like

1044
01:03:36,025 --> 01:03:39,085
Speaker 12:  the only things I have access to at my fingertips are things that I would

1045
01:03:39,085 --> 01:03:42,725
Speaker 12:  like to spend more time on and that I think are good for my body and my

1046
01:03:42,725 --> 01:03:46,645
Speaker 12:  mind and my soul. Everything else I have to actively seek out. And

1047
01:03:46,645 --> 01:03:48,925
Speaker 12:  that is a good thing. That means, you know, I still watch YouTube videos

1048
01:03:48,985 --> 01:03:52,285
Speaker 12:  but I watch them when I have decided I wanted to watch a YouTube video.

1049
01:03:52,645 --> 01:03:55,565
Speaker 12:  Hmm. And I think one of the issues that so many people have is that, you

1050
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:58,605
Speaker 12:  know, if you are for example, drained of energy, you just find yourself

1051
01:03:58,675 --> 01:04:01,525
Speaker 12:  scrolling through TikTok or Instagram or whatever and when was the last

1052
01:04:01,525 --> 01:04:04,925
Speaker 12:  time you got off a scrolling session and thought, wow, I, I feel so energy

1053
01:04:04,925 --> 01:04:08,885
Speaker 12:  energized as a result of that never. Whereas going for a walk or

1054
01:04:09,105 --> 01:04:13,005
Speaker 12:  don don't know playing the guitar is a, you know, there's to towards

1055
01:04:13,005 --> 01:04:15,605
Speaker 12:  the end of the book, like generally creative things or things that like

1056
01:04:15,605 --> 01:04:19,445
Speaker 12:  help us flex our sense of autonomy or things that help us sort of separate

1057
01:04:19,515 --> 01:04:22,605
Speaker 12:  from work. These are really the things that recharge our energy and we all

1058
01:04:22,605 --> 01:04:26,005
Speaker 12:  know that. It's just we don't do it because it's, it's too easy to look

1059
01:04:26,005 --> 01:04:29,285
Speaker 12:  at the notification and like click on the thing and then now we're scrolling

1060
01:04:29,285 --> 01:04:30,085
Speaker 12:  before. Yeah.

1061
01:04:30,085 --> 01:04:33,165
Speaker 3:  Well and that brings me back to, I hate to keep harping on the, like, can

1062
01:04:33,165 --> 01:04:36,685
Speaker 3:  we do any of this online stuff? But it's telling to me that like you, you

1063
01:04:36,685 --> 01:04:38,965
Speaker 3:  had a a section in the book where it was like the two columns, right? Like

1064
01:04:38,965 --> 01:04:41,645
Speaker 3:  the things I do when I'm tired and the things that are actually restorative

1065
01:04:41,985 --> 01:04:45,245
Speaker 3:  and it's like the things you do when you're tired are look at screens and

1066
01:04:45,245 --> 01:04:47,845
Speaker 3:  the things that are restorative are basically like don't look at screens

1067
01:04:48,265 --> 01:04:48,485
Speaker 3:  and

1068
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:49,165
Speaker 12:  Yeah, pretty

1069
01:04:49,165 --> 01:04:52,565
Speaker 3:  Much. And, and to some extent I think maybe the answer is just what we need

1070
01:04:52,565 --> 01:04:56,365
Speaker 3:  is more balance. I think that's absolutely right. That like the, the

1071
01:04:56,365 --> 01:04:59,645
Speaker 3:  touch grass joke on the internet is like it's right, right? Like we should

1072
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:03,045
Speaker 3:  all spend a lot less time looking at screens. Like that is objectively true.

1073
01:05:03,305 --> 01:05:07,085
Speaker 3:  But I also wonder in this like phase that

1074
01:05:07,085 --> 01:05:10,965
Speaker 3:  we're in, where like can we solve technology with more technology? Is

1075
01:05:10,965 --> 01:05:14,205
Speaker 3:  there a sort of digital answer to this? And I think, like I talk to a lot

1076
01:05:14,205 --> 01:05:17,645
Speaker 3:  of people who do art on the iPad and that I think is like a perfectly

1077
01:05:18,055 --> 01:05:20,685
Speaker 3:  valid restorative use of screens, right? Like you're still looking at a screen,

1078
01:05:20,685 --> 01:05:23,285
Speaker 3:  but it is like a fundamentally creative activity. I've been learning how

1079
01:05:23,285 --> 01:05:27,005
Speaker 3:  to play guitar using an app called Musician. I think that counts no Nice.

1080
01:05:27,105 --> 01:05:30,565
Speaker 3:  But I do wonder like do you have versions of those things? Like are there,

1081
01:05:30,565 --> 01:05:34,525
Speaker 3:  are there things you can do still looking at your phone or a computer or

1082
01:05:34,565 --> 01:05:37,125
Speaker 3:  a screen of some kind that recharge you in that same way?

1083
01:05:37,515 --> 01:05:41,205
Speaker 12:  Yeah. So I, Don I don Dunno if this is just me, but one thing I love doing

1084
01:05:41,425 --> 01:05:45,205
Speaker 12:  is listening to a Lord of the Rings ambience type

1085
01:05:45,235 --> 01:05:49,165
Speaker 12:  soundtracks on YouTube. Okay. While working, 'cause I was doing some

1086
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:51,205
Speaker 12:  research for the book and there, there seems to be this weird thing where

1087
01:05:51,205 --> 01:05:55,165
Speaker 12:  hearing the sounds of nature has this weirdly energizing effect on

1088
01:05:55,165 --> 01:05:58,085
Speaker 12:  us. So you can obviously walking through nature is like the best, but you

1089
01:05:58,085 --> 01:06:01,005
Speaker 12:  can even just listen to Birds song or listen to like the sound of waves

1090
01:06:01,005 --> 01:06:04,245
Speaker 12:  of something and that taps into something in our brain. No one quite knows

1091
01:06:04,245 --> 01:06:07,445
Speaker 12:  what it is, but it seems to be quite energizing. Hmm. And so people have

1092
01:06:07,445 --> 01:06:10,005
Speaker 12:  put these like playlists together, like three hour long videos on YouTube

1093
01:06:10,005 --> 01:06:13,405
Speaker 12:  where it's like Harry Potter music or Lord the Ring's music, but with the

1094
01:06:13,405 --> 01:06:16,685
Speaker 12:  sounds of rain or the sounds of birds. I just love that shit. It's, it's

1095
01:06:16,685 --> 01:06:19,565
Speaker 12:  so nice and it's like anything becomes more fun and more energizing when

1096
01:06:19,565 --> 01:06:22,605
Speaker 12:  doing it with that sort of soundtrack in the background. So that's a way

1097
01:06:22,605 --> 01:06:26,165
Speaker 12:  in which I try and recharge while also also looking at a screen. One thing

1098
01:06:26,165 --> 01:06:28,245
Speaker 12:  someone should do, some someone needs to make an app that lets you listen

1099
01:06:28,245 --> 01:06:32,005
Speaker 12:  to podcasts, but with background music, you know like with some like meditation

1100
01:06:32,005 --> 01:06:34,645
Speaker 12:  apps like Waking Up by Sam Harris, it's like you can listen to the lectures

1101
01:06:34,675 --> 01:06:37,525
Speaker 12:  with some background music and the background music makes it so much more

1102
01:06:37,525 --> 01:06:39,245
Speaker 12:  immersive. That's pretty, I need someone to make this

1103
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:43,005
Speaker 3:  App, like listen to this podcast in the rainforest. It's like

1104
01:06:43,405 --> 01:06:44,645
Speaker 3:  I would do that. I would listen to that.

1105
01:06:44,675 --> 01:06:48,485
Speaker 12:  Yeah, rainforest or Epic or like classical or whatever, like lo-fi

1106
01:06:48,545 --> 01:06:50,285
Speaker 12:  and just makes the podcast more engaging.

1107
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:54,325
Speaker 3:  That's a problem AI could solve. Figure out how to score the the beats of

1108
01:06:54,325 --> 01:06:56,605
Speaker 3:  a of a podcast like that. It could do it. Oh

1109
01:06:56,605 --> 01:06:57,685
Speaker 12:  That would be cool. That's a good idea.

1110
01:06:58,005 --> 01:06:59,725
Speaker 3:  Ali, I think we just started a company. This is very exciting

1111
01:06:59,725 --> 01:07:02,045
Speaker 12:  For us. I think we did. Yeah, we've got a registered domain soon.

1112
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:13,405
Speaker 3:  All right Ali, thank you again everybody. Bye. Ali's book, Feel

1113
01:07:13,405 --> 01:07:16,885
Speaker 3:  Good. Productivity How to Do, More of What, Matters, To You. Great book.

1114
01:07:16,885 --> 01:07:20,285
Speaker 3:  Highly recommend it. We have to take one more break and then we're gonna

1115
01:07:20,285 --> 01:07:23,085
Speaker 3:  come back and answer a question on the birch cast. Hotline, we'll be right

1116
01:08:30,785 --> 01:08:31,605
Speaker 5:  for more details.

1117
01:09:39,545 --> 01:09:43,475
Speaker 3:  Welcome back. Let's get to the Hotline as always. The number is 8 6 6

1118
01:09:43,715 --> 01:09:47,355
Speaker 3:  Verge one one and the email is Vergecast at The Verge dot com. We love all

1119
01:09:47,355 --> 01:09:50,555
Speaker 3:  of your questions and we try to answer at least one on the show every week.

1120
01:09:50,575 --> 01:09:54,475
Speaker 3:  We have some super fun things coming in. Thank you to everybody who writes

1121
01:09:54,475 --> 01:09:57,675
Speaker 3:  and calls. It's my favorite thing about the first cast this week we have

1122
01:09:57,675 --> 01:10:01,075
Speaker 3:  a question from Erland from Norway, which seems relevant to what we've been

1123
01:10:01,075 --> 01:10:04,275
Speaker 3:  talking about today. Erland sent us an email that says I need to get a new

1124
01:10:04,295 --> 01:10:08,115
Speaker 3:  Mac. My last one is from 2014. It is a MacBook Pro, but now

1125
01:10:08,135 --> 01:10:11,515
Speaker 3:  I'm thinking of a Mac Mini to have at home and maybe later a MacBook Air

1126
01:10:11,515 --> 01:10:14,915
Speaker 3:  for travel, or should I just get a MacBook Pro? Again, I'm a hobby

1127
01:10:14,915 --> 01:10:18,115
Speaker 3:  photographer and videographer, but mostly I use it for presentations for

1128
01:10:18,115 --> 01:10:21,795
Speaker 3:  my job as a teacher. So that's the question. I have gone back and forth on

1129
01:10:21,795 --> 01:10:25,715
Speaker 3:  this question a thousand times, both in my life dealing with

1130
01:10:25,995 --> 01:10:29,755
Speaker 3:  my own setup and also just in general trying

1131
01:10:29,775 --> 01:10:33,355
Speaker 3:  to think through the best way to use a computer. Basically it's like should

1132
01:10:33,355 --> 01:10:36,555
Speaker 3:  you have a workstation at home and then a thing you take with you? Or should

1133
01:10:36,555 --> 01:10:40,475
Speaker 3:  you just have one computer that you kind of dock in and out of various

1134
01:10:40,775 --> 01:10:44,595
Speaker 3:  setups as you need it? I will say personally, I'm in a one computer

1135
01:10:44,835 --> 01:10:48,115
Speaker 3:  at home and one computer on the road phase. I'm actually on a Mac Mini right

1136
01:10:48,115 --> 01:10:51,995
Speaker 3:  now as I record this and I have a MacBook Air that goes with me whenever

1137
01:10:52,155 --> 01:10:55,755
Speaker 3:  I leave the house, which is increasingly rarely, but that's for another day.

1138
01:10:56,295 --> 01:11:00,115
Speaker 3:  So I think for most people though, if this is what you're

1139
01:11:00,275 --> 01:11:04,235
Speaker 3:  debating this specific thing, I think the answer is the MacBook Pro and I

1140
01:11:04,235 --> 01:11:06,915
Speaker 3:  went through just to spec it out real quick and see what the cost would be.

1141
01:11:06,935 --> 01:11:10,035
Speaker 3:  So you have a 13 inch MacBook Air, just the M

1142
01:11:10,055 --> 01:11:13,885
Speaker 3:  2 256 gigs, the base model MacBook Air for

1143
01:11:14,025 --> 01:11:17,725
Speaker 3:  1090 $9. I desperately want to upgrade your RAM here for

1144
01:11:17,725 --> 01:11:21,365
Speaker 3:  $200 more, but we'll leave it alone for now. And then you have the

1145
01:11:21,415 --> 01:11:25,365
Speaker 3:  eight gigabytes, 2 56 gigabytes M two base model

1146
01:11:25,505 --> 01:11:28,925
Speaker 3:  Mac Mini for $599. So you're at like

1147
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:33,125
Speaker 3:  1700 bucks all in between these two machines, two great

1148
01:11:33,125 --> 01:11:36,565
Speaker 3:  machines. They do a pretty good job of talking to each other. one of the

1149
01:11:36,565 --> 01:11:39,565
Speaker 3:  things you run the risk of with having two separate machines is you have

1150
01:11:39,735 --> 01:11:42,725
Speaker 3:  stuff on one device that's not on another device, but things like iCloud

1151
01:11:42,725 --> 01:11:46,605
Speaker 3:  Drive make that easier. I personally am just religious about uploading

1152
01:11:46,605 --> 01:11:50,005
Speaker 3:  stuff to Google Drive so that it's everywhere. It's a relatively easily solved

1153
01:11:50,205 --> 01:11:53,765
Speaker 3:  problem, but it is a thing that can happen. Or you can get a

1154
01:11:54,155 --> 01:11:57,445
Speaker 3:  base 14 inch M three MacBook Pro.

1155
01:11:58,015 --> 01:12:01,725
Speaker 3:  Again, base model, I wanna spend $200 to upgrade your ram, but you can just

1156
01:12:01,725 --> 01:12:05,565
Speaker 3:  get the stock base model for 1599. So for

1157
01:12:05,565 --> 01:12:09,085
Speaker 3:  all intents and purposes, the price is not that different, but it's a little

1158
01:12:09,085 --> 01:12:12,605
Speaker 3:  bit cheaper to just get the pro and I think that's the answer.

1159
01:12:13,075 --> 01:12:16,845
Speaker 3:  It's the newer computer, it's gonna last you longer. It has the better

1160
01:12:16,955 --> 01:12:20,605
Speaker 3:  processor. It has Apple's latest stuff. I think the PRO is

1161
01:12:21,165 --> 01:12:24,965
Speaker 3:  probably the single most versatile computer that Apple makes.

1162
01:12:25,225 --> 01:12:29,125
Speaker 3:  The M1, even MacBook Air and especially the

1163
01:12:29,245 --> 01:12:32,965
Speaker 3:  M two MacBook Air are gonna be plenty for all of the sort of standard presentation

1164
01:12:32,965 --> 01:12:36,645
Speaker 3:  stuff. But you'll notice the difference when you're doing things like editing

1165
01:12:36,645 --> 01:12:40,565
Speaker 3:  photos, and especially dealing with video. The speed increase you'll get

1166
01:12:40,565 --> 01:12:44,445
Speaker 3:  on the pro is meaningful. It's not gonna totally change your life, but it

1167
01:12:44,505 --> 01:12:48,325
Speaker 3:  is noticeable. And then on top of that, the MacBook Pro

1168
01:12:48,325 --> 01:12:52,165
Speaker 3:  gets just outrageous battery life. It's not super heavy, it's

1169
01:12:52,165 --> 01:12:55,965
Speaker 3:  noticeably heavier than the air, but it's not like gonna weigh down your

1170
01:12:56,165 --> 01:13:00,045
Speaker 3:  backpack in a super brutal way. And I think if

1171
01:13:00,065 --> 01:13:02,925
Speaker 3:  the question is should I get an error or should I get a pro, most people

1172
01:13:03,125 --> 01:13:06,805
Speaker 3:  I would tell to get just an error. But if you're debating, do I get an error

1173
01:13:06,945 --> 01:13:10,845
Speaker 3:  and then a mini, I think the pro actually overlaps

1174
01:13:11,025 --> 01:13:14,965
Speaker 3:  what's good about both of those computers in a pretty good way. So I

1175
01:13:14,965 --> 01:13:18,845
Speaker 3:  think if I were in your position, I would just get a 14 inch MacBook Pro,

1176
01:13:19,435 --> 01:13:23,205
Speaker 3:  spec it out as much as you can, and plan for that thing to last you an awfully

1177
01:13:23,205 --> 01:13:26,565
Speaker 3:  long time. You got 10 years outta your last MacBook Pro. I wouldn't be surprised

1178
01:13:26,565 --> 01:13:30,205
Speaker 3:  if you get just as long out of this one. So that's what I do. But Erland,

1179
01:13:30,315 --> 01:13:33,405
Speaker 3:  tell me what you decide and how it goes. And also if you have thoughts on

1181
01:13:37,405 --> 01:13:39,805
