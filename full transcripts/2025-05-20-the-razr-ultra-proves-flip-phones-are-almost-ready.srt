Description: Kids these days, you know? They love the '90s, they want everything to be colorful and bold and bouncy, and they really, truly love Snapchat. And the tech world is listening. On this episode, The Verge's Allison Johnson joins to talk about her review of the new Razr Ultra, the new-look Android 16, and why she thinks we're getting ever closer to a true flip phone resurgence. (Also: why we're not quite there yet.) After that, The Verge's Alex Heath explains what's going on with Snapchat, and how it's possible that the app is more popular than ever but still can't figure out how to cash in. It all makes us wonder: is there a business in chat at all? Finally, we answer a question on the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about a possible outcome for Chrome after the Google search trial ends.


2
00:00:03,575 --> 00:00:07,025
Speaker 2:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of really important

3
00:00:07,025 --> 00:00:10,745
Speaker 2:  technology with absolutely no business model. I'm m your friend David Pierce,

4
00:00:10,965 --> 00:00:14,545
Speaker 2:  and I am somewhere in the woods in the mountains of Virginia.

5
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:18,905
Speaker 2:  This is the week every year. That is Mother's Day, my wife's

6
00:00:19,105 --> 00:00:22,825
Speaker 2:  birthday, our wedding anniversary, and this year her grad school

7
00:00:22,825 --> 00:00:26,785
Speaker 2:  graduation. Congrats Anna. All in the span of seven days. So we try to get

8
00:00:26,785 --> 00:00:30,505
Speaker 2:  away, we try to have some fun, and this time it was go sit in the woods

9
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:34,825
Speaker 2:  and just be quiet. It's been lovely. Can't recommend it enough, but that

10
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:37,465
Speaker 2:  is not what we're here to talk about today. Today we're gonna do two things

11
00:00:37,465 --> 00:00:41,345
Speaker 2:  on the show. First, we're gonna talk about a couple of really

12
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:45,185
Speaker 2:  important new devices, and by new devices, I mean flip phones.

13
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:49,265
Speaker 2:  The new Motorola, Razr Ultra is out. Alison Johnson reviewed it. We're gonna

14
00:00:49,265 --> 00:00:51,785
Speaker 2:  talk about that. And we're also gonna talk a little bit about whether this

15
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:55,665
Speaker 2:  is finally the year of flip phones. Then Alex Heath is gonna come on

16
00:00:55,665 --> 00:00:58,705
Speaker 2:  and we're gonna talk about Snapchat. We're gonna talk about WhatsApp and

17
00:00:58,705 --> 00:01:02,585
Speaker 2:  we're gonna talk about whether letting people talk to each other is actually

18
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:06,265
Speaker 2:  a tech business that even exists. We also have a really fun question on The

19
00:01:06,385 --> 00:01:09,465
Speaker 2:  Vergecast hotline. Lots of stuff to do. All of that is coming up in just

20
00:01:09,505 --> 00:01:13,225
Speaker 2:  a sec. But first I have, I'm gonna be honest, just like a tiny bit more celebrating

21
00:01:13,225 --> 00:01:17,105
Speaker 2:  to do. And also I have not yet baked cake, So I gotta go bake a cake.

22
00:01:17,455 --> 00:01:19,665
Speaker 2:  Wish me luck. This is The Vergecast. We'll be right back.

23
00:02:01,905 --> 00:02:04,395
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. Allison Johnson is here. Hi Allison.

24
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:05,275
Speaker 4:  Hello.

25
00:02:05,665 --> 00:02:09,275
Speaker 2:  I've seen a lot of you recently for reasons I both can and cannot explain

26
00:02:09,415 --> 00:02:12,195
Speaker 2:  yet. Yeah, and it's, this is very exciting. It's, it's nice to

27
00:02:12,195 --> 00:02:15,075
Speaker 4:  See you again. It's good. It's a good addition to my life. I don't, I don

28
00:02:15,075 --> 00:02:15,275
Speaker 4:  Dunno.

29
00:02:16,535 --> 00:02:19,595
Speaker 2:  So there are two Android things I wanna talk about.

30
00:02:20,735 --> 00:02:24,035
Speaker 2:  One is kind of the like big picture Android 16

31
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:28,755
Speaker 2:  material three cool kid, young people design.

32
00:02:30,415 --> 00:02:34,355
Speaker 2:  But first I wanna talk about the razor. Yes. Because you and I might

33
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:38,275
Speaker 2:  be the only people on earth who believe in flip phones, but I still believe

34
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:38,875
Speaker 2:  in flip phones.

35
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:41,315
Speaker 4:  Yes, I do too. You

36
00:02:41,755 --> 00:02:45,555
Speaker 2:  Reviewed the new Razr Ultra, which is like the high end flip

37
00:02:45,555 --> 00:02:45,835
Speaker 2:  phone.

38
00:02:47,465 --> 00:02:48,955
Speaker 2:  What was the verdict? How'd you feel?

39
00:02:49,785 --> 00:02:53,475
Speaker 4:  It's so beautiful. Like, I can't emphasize this enough,

40
00:02:53,785 --> 00:02:57,275
Speaker 4:  like I don't get to say this a lot. They're shaped like phones. They look

41
00:02:57,275 --> 00:03:01,125
Speaker 4:  like phones, you know, we've like settled on a, a thing

42
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:05,005
Speaker 4:  for phones. This is a gorgeous phone. So the ultra

43
00:03:05,095 --> 00:03:09,085
Speaker 4:  comes in the, the like fancier finishes. They're all kind of

44
00:03:09,085 --> 00:03:13,045
Speaker 4:  fun. There's the regular razor and then the razor plus this one has the

45
00:03:13,045 --> 00:03:16,125
Speaker 4:  wood panel back. Maybe because I made such a stink about it,

46
00:03:17,845 --> 00:03:20,965
Speaker 4:  Motorola knew that that's the one I wanted.

47
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:25,205
Speaker 4:  It's gorgeous. It's not a huge departure or

48
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:29,725
Speaker 4:  huge evolution of the razor. I would say from last year.

49
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:33,685
Speaker 4:  Like there's some upgraded specs. You get the Snapdragon eight

50
00:03:33,855 --> 00:03:37,605
Speaker 4:  elite processor, which is just the most amount of firepower

51
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:41,605
Speaker 4:  you can throw at a phone. Right now. It has like a slightly bigger

52
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:46,085
Speaker 4:  interior screen than the other two. It has a seven inch display, it's

53
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:49,285
Speaker 4:  a little bit higher resolution and you get

54
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:53,765
Speaker 4:  upgraded cameras. There's an upgraded like 50 megapixel main

55
00:03:54,005 --> 00:03:57,885
Speaker 4:  camera, an ultra wide and then a 50 megapixel selfie camera.

56
00:03:58,425 --> 00:04:01,125
Speaker 2:  The cameras by the way, seems like a super big deal to me 'cause I think

57
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:05,405
Speaker 2:  one of the reasons I was excited about this phone in the first place is it's

58
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:09,325
Speaker 2:  one of the first flip phones I can think of where you

59
00:04:09,325 --> 00:04:13,285
Speaker 2:  don't look at the spec sheet and immediately see some glaring deficiency.

60
00:04:13,595 --> 00:04:17,405
Speaker 2:  Yeah. That It is like in theory, this is just a very good phone that

61
00:04:17,435 --> 00:04:21,405
Speaker 2:  also happens to be a flip phone. It's not like the Samsung stuff. It always

62
00:04:21,505 --> 00:04:25,445
Speaker 2:  has worse cameras than the, the normal candy bar phones. There's

63
00:04:25,505 --> 00:04:29,445
Speaker 2:  always some issue and the ultra seems like

64
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:33,005
Speaker 2:  it's, it's the first one with like a feature complete spec sheet,

65
00:04:33,335 --> 00:04:34,445
Speaker 2:  which is very exciting to me.

66
00:04:34,945 --> 00:04:38,925
Speaker 4:  It is. I would say it's like it has closed the gap more than

67
00:04:39,105 --> 00:04:40,845
Speaker 4:  any other flip phone for sure,

68
00:04:41,185 --> 00:04:42,125
Speaker 2:  But it's not all the way there.

69
00:04:42,755 --> 00:04:46,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Just the thing is like they, they called it Ultra, which already,

70
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:50,725
Speaker 4:  you know, you're, you're setting, you're making your bed

71
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:54,685
Speaker 4:  when you call a phone ultra fair. Yeah. And the Samsung Galaxy S 25

72
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:58,565
Speaker 4:  Ultra exists. It costs $1,300 and if

73
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:02,405
Speaker 4:  you want to get into like what, how much phone can you get

74
00:05:02,405 --> 00:05:05,965
Speaker 4:  for $1,300? You can get a phone with so many cameras,

75
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:10,245
Speaker 4:  you know, and like an amazing display. Like if you

76
00:05:10,245 --> 00:05:14,085
Speaker 4:  wanna get into that, there's still kind of, we're not quite at like

77
00:05:14,385 --> 00:05:17,885
Speaker 4:  parody I guess, but this does feel like they're like, we

78
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:22,045
Speaker 4:  shoved as much as we can in here. I found the battery life was

79
00:05:22,045 --> 00:05:25,845
Speaker 4:  like real good, honestly. Which is nice. Yeah. Is a

80
00:05:26,155 --> 00:05:30,045
Speaker 4:  concern for a flip phone. 'cause they are secretly just like two small

81
00:05:30,045 --> 00:05:33,965
Speaker 4:  phones like strapped together. Yeah. It, it feels

82
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:38,205
Speaker 4:  more than ever before. Like if you have been thinking about

83
00:05:38,285 --> 00:05:42,085
Speaker 4:  a flip phone and kind of put off by like Yeah, you know, but I want a little

84
00:05:42,115 --> 00:05:45,765
Speaker 4:  more, I don't wanna give up so much this, you don't have to give up

85
00:05:46,015 --> 00:05:47,565
Speaker 4:  quite so much this time around.

86
00:05:47,995 --> 00:05:51,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Or, or or having just increasingly

87
00:05:51,995 --> 00:05:55,925
Speaker 2:  more ideas. Yeah. Some of those ideas seem to be good

88
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:58,640
Speaker 2:  and some of them seem to be bad, but I feel like the, the two pieces of it

89
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,165
Speaker 2:  that I most wanna talk about are the outside screen, which I think

90
00:06:03,065 --> 00:06:06,885
Speaker 2:  my impression has been, Motorola has kind of done the most of the flip

91
00:06:06,885 --> 00:06:09,885
Speaker 2:  phone manufacturers in terms of like what you can actually do on the outside

92
00:06:09,885 --> 00:06:12,725
Speaker 2:  screen and then we have to talk about ai. But let's talk about that later

93
00:06:12,725 --> 00:06:13,805
Speaker 2:  because I don't want to

94
00:06:15,465 --> 00:06:19,445
Speaker 2:  the outside screen. What has, has Motorola like continued to kind of

95
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,125
Speaker 2:  dial in what you can do with the phone closed?

96
00:06:21,635 --> 00:06:25,485
Speaker 4:  Yeah, and, and I think for my money they, they're

97
00:06:25,775 --> 00:06:29,725
Speaker 4:  ahead and I have to apologize to the flip phones that are not sold

98
00:06:29,725 --> 00:06:33,685
Speaker 4:  in the us. I don't really get to play with those. So I'm really kind

99
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:37,645
Speaker 4:  of basing this on experience versus the Samsung Z flip six.

100
00:06:37,795 --> 00:06:41,565
Speaker 4:  Sure. Motorola just makes it super inviting and really easy

101
00:06:41,825 --> 00:06:45,685
Speaker 4:  to enable apps on the outer display. There's little

102
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:49,765
Speaker 4:  games which I normally shrug off. I was like, I, I don't

103
00:06:49,765 --> 00:06:53,725
Speaker 4:  wanna play a little marble game, but I handed the marble game to my

104
00:06:53,735 --> 00:06:57,725
Speaker 4:  child, to my three-year-old and he frigging loves it

105
00:06:58,545 --> 00:07:00,845
Speaker 4:  and he's actually kind of good at it. So like

106
00:07:02,145 --> 00:07:05,645
Speaker 4:  that's been a weird little bonus feature where I just hand him the phone

107
00:07:05,785 --> 00:07:08,805
Speaker 4:  and it's closed and he has a little marble game moment,

108
00:07:09,745 --> 00:07:13,325
Speaker 4:  but they, they make it really easy. There's a new like widget panel so you

109
00:07:13,325 --> 00:07:16,725
Speaker 4:  can kind of get even more like into

110
00:07:16,755 --> 00:07:20,605
Speaker 4:  customization for it. The, just like, the media

111
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:24,365
Speaker 4:  player is cute. You can make it a tape deck and the, the little

112
00:07:24,395 --> 00:07:28,365
Speaker 4:  tape reels. I like that like move as the music is playing.

113
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:31,205
Speaker 4:  I just, it it's fun. Yeah. I love it. The,

114
00:07:31,205 --> 00:07:35,005
Speaker 2:  The thing I've been trying to decide with all of the outside screens on

115
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:38,765
Speaker 2:  flip phones is whether their job is to be like a

116
00:07:38,765 --> 00:07:42,565
Speaker 2:  worse phone or if their job is to be more like a smartwatch where

117
00:07:42,565 --> 00:07:46,405
Speaker 2:  it's like simple controls but you can't actually

118
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:50,045
Speaker 2:  do very much. Right. Like, you, you, you hit one button at a time and that's

119
00:07:50,045 --> 00:07:53,885
Speaker 2:  kind of it. Yeah. What's what's your read on sort of in

120
00:07:53,885 --> 00:07:56,845
Speaker 2:  day-to-day use? How you want the outer screen to work?

121
00:07:57,485 --> 00:08:00,325
Speaker 4:  I think it's somewhere in the middle. Okay. I kind of started with like,

122
00:08:00,585 --> 00:08:03,565
Speaker 4:  the flip phone has a little smart watch on the front and that's cool and

123
00:08:03,585 --> 00:08:07,565
Speaker 4:  fun and you can do quick things. I end up doing a lot

124
00:08:07,565 --> 00:08:11,525
Speaker 4:  more than that on this phone. I actually had my digital boarding pass

125
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:15,085
Speaker 4:  for my flight on there and I pulled it out and had the,

126
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,965
Speaker 4:  the gate agent scan it and he was like, that's a cute little phone.

127
00:08:19,845 --> 00:08:23,805
Speaker 4:  I was like, oh, he doesn't know it's two phones in one.

128
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:28,765
Speaker 4:  But I like, I enable a lot of apps

129
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:33,165
Speaker 4:  So I can just fully open up Strava. I can choose

130
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:36,725
Speaker 4:  my activity, start my bike ride, and then just like put the phone away in

131
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:40,365
Speaker 4:  my pocket. Have I saved some kind of amazing amount of time

132
00:08:40,585 --> 00:08:44,285
Speaker 4:  or is it that much more convenient? I think it's like a, an

133
00:08:44,585 --> 00:08:48,565
Speaker 4:  an emotional like mental thing where I don't feel like I,

134
00:08:48,685 --> 00:08:52,325
Speaker 4:  I had to like dive into my whole phone and look at every notification.

135
00:08:53,665 --> 00:08:57,005
Speaker 4:  So for me it's really, it's really somewhere in the middle. I respond to

136
00:08:57,005 --> 00:09:00,725
Speaker 4:  text, I'll use the little keyboard. It's kind of janky, but it's perfect

137
00:09:00,945 --> 00:09:04,765
Speaker 4:  for just like, hey, on my way or, or those kind of things. So

138
00:09:05,305 --> 00:09:09,125
Speaker 4:  it can be less if you want it to be, but for me I've, it kind of crept towards

139
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,925
Speaker 4:  like it's a cute little phone when I want it.

140
00:09:12,445 --> 00:09:16,405
Speaker 2:  Hmm. Can you do things like open settings

141
00:09:16,545 --> 00:09:20,405
Speaker 2:  and get to the notification shade and like if you want sort of the full

142
00:09:20,405 --> 00:09:22,605
Speaker 2:  phone experience on the front screen, can you get it?

143
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:26,845
Speaker 4:  You can get a lot. Yeah. Okay. It has its own kind of built in UI for,

144
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:30,725
Speaker 4:  there's a, the notifications panel and

145
00:09:30,725 --> 00:09:34,445
Speaker 4:  you can swipe through that like you normally would. There's quick

146
00:09:34,445 --> 00:09:38,325
Speaker 4:  settings and, and all that stuff. You can run any app

147
00:09:38,325 --> 00:09:42,245
Speaker 4:  you want on it and you just have to tap through a, an alert

148
00:09:42,245 --> 00:09:46,085
Speaker 4:  that says like, Hey, this might suck. And sometimes

149
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:46,645
Speaker 4:  it really does.

150
00:09:48,545 --> 00:09:52,285
Speaker 4:  But Yeah. It's like Motorola is very like, it's your world.

151
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:54,405
Speaker 4:  You can do what you want with this and I love that.

152
00:09:55,075 --> 00:09:57,765
Speaker 2:  Yeah. That feels like mostly the right answer. There is a little part of

153
00:09:57,765 --> 00:10:01,525
Speaker 2:  me that is like, there should be a set of things that it

154
00:10:01,765 --> 00:10:04,245
Speaker 2:  protects you from in a certain way where it's like

155
00:10:05,545 --> 00:10:07,925
Speaker 2:  the, the notification shade is an interesting one Right. Because I feel like

156
00:10:07,925 --> 00:10:11,485
Speaker 2:  it should, I want it to show me the notification that like just

157
00:10:11,505 --> 00:10:15,325
Speaker 2:  buzzed in my pocket. Mm. But I actually feel like I want to have to open

158
00:10:15,425 --> 00:10:19,045
Speaker 2:  the phone in order to go get the rest of my notifications. Oh. Because there,

159
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:22,045
Speaker 2:  there's just that, that little tiny bit of added friction feels like it's,

160
00:10:22,045 --> 00:10:25,485
Speaker 2:  yeah. Useful. And again, it's, it's the thing you're describing that I think

161
00:10:26,565 --> 00:10:30,005
Speaker 2:  I find so charming about flip phones in the first place is that like when

162
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:33,605
Speaker 2:  I go to a text message, making it a literal physical

163
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:37,605
Speaker 2:  activity I have to do in order to then go open Instagram is going to

164
00:10:37,605 --> 00:10:41,445
Speaker 2:  prevent me from opening Instagram. Oh yeah. And I, I think like that, that's

165
00:10:41,605 --> 00:10:45,205
Speaker 2:  probably still true in this case just because the front screen is small enough

166
00:10:45,205 --> 00:10:48,245
Speaker 2:  and not quite good enough to really be a good Instagram experience. But I

167
00:10:48,245 --> 00:10:52,085
Speaker 2:  do feel like dialing in that sort of, how do we give you all the things to

168
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:55,965
Speaker 2:  do without then just sort of letting you into your phone

169
00:10:56,265 --> 00:10:59,885
Speaker 2:  unless you open the phone feels like that's the balance. I don't know that

170
00:10:59,885 --> 00:11:01,725
Speaker 2:  anybody has quite dialed in. Yeah.

171
00:11:02,065 --> 00:11:05,725
Speaker 4:  And it's a little bit of like personal responsibility

172
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:08,685
Speaker 4:  because Instagram is a hundred percent the one I will like

173
00:11:09,055 --> 00:11:12,885
Speaker 4:  mindlessly tap on a notification from the outer screen and

174
00:11:12,885 --> 00:11:16,805
Speaker 4:  it'll be like, you wanna open Instagram? Like, I haven't enabled it for

175
00:11:16,805 --> 00:11:20,245
Speaker 4:  the outer screen. And I'm like, oh no, no, no. I, I don't actually. And I

176
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:23,925
Speaker 4:  like back away like the social media apps

177
00:11:23,945 --> 00:11:27,845
Speaker 4:  really, I, I've kept off the front screen and it would be a bad

178
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:31,845
Speaker 4:  experience using them. You could if you wanted to. But

179
00:11:32,285 --> 00:11:36,205
Speaker 4:  I have maintained that as my, my barrier of like, I'm not

180
00:11:36,205 --> 00:11:39,645
Speaker 4:  gonna cross this line. I'm gonna have to make a conscious decision to open

181
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,645
Speaker 4:  the phone if I wanna check on Instagram.

182
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:45,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And that's an okay balance that you can set that up for yourself. Feels

183
00:11:45,285 --> 00:11:46,965
Speaker 2:  like a good, that's an okay way to do it.

184
00:11:47,035 --> 00:11:47,325
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

185
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:51,845
Speaker 2:  Tell me about the AI stuff. I think Motorola, again has just a lot of

186
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:54,045
Speaker 2:  ideas about what AI is supposed to do on your phone.

187
00:11:54,675 --> 00:11:58,045
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It was a little overwhelming. I, I'm still like

188
00:11:58,755 --> 00:12:01,645
Speaker 4:  reserving a little bit of judgment 'cause I wanna live with some of this

189
00:12:01,645 --> 00:12:05,565
Speaker 4:  stuff a little bit longer. But, so they have introduced something

190
00:12:05,565 --> 00:12:09,085
Speaker 4:  called Modo ai, which is really just, there's an app on the phone

191
00:12:09,705 --> 00:12:13,605
Speaker 4:  and it's kind of a dashboard for all the, these AI features

192
00:12:13,635 --> 00:12:17,485
Speaker 4:  that, that live alongside Gemini in every

193
00:12:17,575 --> 00:12:21,085
Speaker 4:  piece of AI that Google had shoved into Android.

194
00:12:21,785 --> 00:12:25,765
Speaker 4:  But Modo AI is, is like a handful of things. There's

195
00:12:26,255 --> 00:12:30,165
Speaker 4:  Catch me up, which will summarize your recent notifications

196
00:12:30,355 --> 00:12:32,205
Speaker 4:  from messaging apps.

197
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,845
Speaker 2:  Is Motorola better at this than Apple is?

198
00:12:36,425 --> 00:12:40,085
Speaker 4:  Yes. You know what? I think it's really, it's a good co Well, yes and no.

199
00:12:40,085 --> 00:12:43,765
Speaker 4:  Okay. 'cause it can only do the messaging apps. So I'm like, catch me up

200
00:12:43,765 --> 00:12:47,245
Speaker 4:  and I have a bunch of emails that I really need to get into and it it's just

201
00:12:47,245 --> 00:12:50,245
Speaker 4:  like you didn't get any texts in the last hour. Yeah.

202
00:12:50,385 --> 00:12:54,125
Speaker 2:  Is that even solving a, I don't feel like my notification overload is my

203
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,365
Speaker 2:  messaging apps. Like that's not the problem I'm having.

204
00:12:56,705 --> 00:13:00,405
Speaker 4:  That's where I'm hung up on it. I like that it's you opt in,

205
00:13:00,585 --> 00:13:04,365
Speaker 4:  you you're like, sure I need this at this moment. And it makes me more

206
00:13:04,395 --> 00:13:08,285
Speaker 4:  irritated with the Apple alternative, which is like, we're gonna give you

207
00:13:08,325 --> 00:13:12,165
Speaker 4:  a weird little summary of every single notification. It might be wrong too.

208
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:16,205
Speaker 4:  You gotta double check it. So there's that. There is

209
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:19,925
Speaker 4:  something called, remember this, which you can, it's

210
00:13:20,085 --> 00:13:23,965
Speaker 4:  a little pixel screenshots ish. 'cause you can screenshot a, a

211
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:27,565
Speaker 4:  website, you can take a picture of something, you can just write yourself

212
00:13:27,645 --> 00:13:31,565
Speaker 4:  a little text note and it'll save it and kind of catalog it

213
00:13:31,565 --> 00:13:34,685
Speaker 4:  in the way of AI reading it and tagging it.

214
00:13:35,545 --> 00:13:39,405
Speaker 4:  And then you, you ask the Moto AI later like, Hey, what time is

215
00:13:39,405 --> 00:13:43,205
Speaker 4:  my flight tomorrow? And in my experience,

216
00:13:43,225 --> 00:13:46,445
Speaker 4:  it was good with that stuff. It didn't go halluc and eat

217
00:13:47,235 --> 00:13:50,245
Speaker 4:  another flight out of another airport. That's good. Yeah. Yeah.

218
00:13:51,425 --> 00:13:54,925
Speaker 4:  But has that catch where you have to remember to add stuff to it.

219
00:13:55,255 --> 00:13:59,205
Speaker 2:  Right. But I will say I think that is a very cool sort of

220
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:02,685
Speaker 2:  overall idea. This idea of like, you just need a place to

221
00:14:02,965 --> 00:14:06,365
Speaker 2:  dump stuff that you encounter on your phone. Yeah. You know, you, you screenshot

222
00:14:06,405 --> 00:14:08,965
Speaker 2:  a text message or you see a recipe or whatever and you just sort of dump

223
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:12,885
Speaker 2:  it all somewhere that you can like access and query later I think is the

224
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:16,845
Speaker 2:  right idea. Yeah. I'm not super sold on the idea that every phone

225
00:14:16,845 --> 00:14:19,325
Speaker 2:  manufacturer should make this for themselves. I feel like this is better

226
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:23,085
Speaker 2:  as like a cross-platform thing tied to an account that I already have

227
00:14:23,085 --> 00:14:26,885
Speaker 2:  instead of all living on my phone. But this still feels like

228
00:14:27,355 --> 00:14:30,965
Speaker 2:  that in terms of like phone AI stuff actually feels sort of directionally

229
00:14:30,965 --> 00:14:33,885
Speaker 2:  correct to me. Yeah. In the same way that I think pixel screenshots is like

230
00:14:34,085 --> 00:14:34,925
Speaker 2:  a very good idea.

231
00:14:35,235 --> 00:14:38,725
Speaker 4:  Exactly. There's so many times I end up with a thing where I'm like, where

232
00:14:38,725 --> 00:14:42,685
Speaker 4:  do I put this? Like this? I don't wanna just leave it. I don't

233
00:14:42,755 --> 00:14:46,685
Speaker 4:  like wanna put it in a weird chrome bookmarks folder that I've

234
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:50,645
Speaker 4:  forgotten exists and Right. Yeah. So that's one

235
00:14:50,645 --> 00:14:54,125
Speaker 4:  of the things that like this feels promising, wanna use it a little more.

236
00:14:54,985 --> 00:14:58,805
Speaker 4:  And then, then there's like a, an AI voice, you know, recorder.

237
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:02,845
Speaker 4:  Then it makes a transcription just sort of like, you want it to pay attention

238
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:03,485
Speaker 4:  in a meeting

239
00:15:05,025 --> 00:15:05,925
Speaker 4:  you do that kind of thing.

240
00:15:05,925 --> 00:15:08,925
Speaker 2:  Motorola really just trying to do pixel stuff here it sounds like A

241
00:15:08,925 --> 00:15:12,565
Speaker 4:  Little bit. Yeah. Yeah. And it, it gets a little AI overload

242
00:15:12,795 --> 00:15:16,765
Speaker 4:  with the, the fact that Gemini and all that stuff is on

243
00:15:16,765 --> 00:15:20,485
Speaker 4:  here, but also like, they've tried to make it like very

244
00:15:20,485 --> 00:15:24,445
Speaker 4:  obvious how to interact with their ai. So there's like a little

245
00:15:24,805 --> 00:15:28,525
Speaker 4:  floating bubble on the screen that will get you to the ai.

246
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:32,285
Speaker 4:  There's the Moto AI app, which is like right in the middle of the home screen.

247
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:36,525
Speaker 4:  The Ultra has an AI button on the side. So you like

248
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:40,125
Speaker 4:  long press it or short press it and get into the ai.

249
00:15:40,675 --> 00:15:44,565
Speaker 4:  There's also ways to like prop up the phone, have the front

250
00:15:44,565 --> 00:15:48,285
Speaker 4:  screen kind of facing you and you can like approach it and the

251
00:15:48,465 --> 00:15:49,645
Speaker 4:  AI will start listening

252
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:50,565
Speaker 2:  Weird.

253
00:15:50,955 --> 00:15:54,925
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It was all a little much, I di I tried the propping up thing

254
00:15:54,925 --> 00:15:58,125
Speaker 4:  and then I just felt like the phone was watching me. So I,

255
00:15:58,155 --> 00:16:00,605
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So the idea is like you have it on your desk or whatever and then you

256
00:16:00,605 --> 00:16:03,525
Speaker 2:  walk up to it like the, what was it? The Echo show does this right. Where

257
00:16:03,525 --> 00:16:06,805
Speaker 2:  it'll, it'll change the interface when you get close to it. Right. But instead

258
00:16:06,805 --> 00:16:08,645
Speaker 2:  it's an AI assistant being like, what's up?

259
00:16:08,915 --> 00:16:12,445
Speaker 4:  Yeah, yeah. I like that. And there's a little, the little glowing borders

260
00:16:12,445 --> 00:16:15,645
Speaker 4:  going. I'm like, what does that mean? Is it listening? Is it waiting for

261
00:16:15,645 --> 00:16:17,325
Speaker 2:  Me? No, thank you. No, no.

262
00:16:17,665 --> 00:16:18,845
Speaker 4:  Didn't super love it.

263
00:16:19,325 --> 00:16:21,685
Speaker 2:  I do feel like Motorola is in

264
00:16:23,205 --> 00:16:26,805
Speaker 2:  a category I would put a lot of other companies in that I, I don't

265
00:16:26,805 --> 00:16:30,685
Speaker 2:  necessarily blame it for, but they're just so deep on

266
00:16:30,685 --> 00:16:34,565
Speaker 2:  the AI thing that it's like we have to overplay our hand on this that

267
00:16:34,565 --> 00:16:38,085
Speaker 2:  it's like we can't be chill about the ai. We can't just have you discovered

268
00:16:38,085 --> 00:16:42,005
Speaker 2:  over time. We have to just put it in

269
00:16:42,005 --> 00:16:45,245
Speaker 2:  front of you no matter where you are all the time. And this is like early

270
00:16:45,435 --> 00:16:49,085
Speaker 2:  Samsung mistakes, right. Where for years, every time you would do anything,

271
00:16:49,465 --> 00:16:52,405
Speaker 2:  the little popup would appear and Samsung would be like, did you know that

272
00:16:52,405 --> 00:16:56,125
Speaker 2:  milk music exists? And you'd be like, I don't care. Samsung. Like, I'm, I'm

273
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:59,445
Speaker 2:  good. I do know this and I'm not interested in knowing this information and

274
00:17:00,465 --> 00:17:04,045
Speaker 2:  my hope is give it another generation or two and

275
00:17:04,755 --> 00:17:08,565
Speaker 2:  they will stop feeling the need to beat you over the head with AI

276
00:17:08,585 --> 00:17:12,285
Speaker 2:  exists in quite the same way, but It is, everybody

277
00:17:12,385 --> 00:17:16,365
Speaker 2:  is kind of overshooting their actual usefulness with a lot

278
00:17:16,365 --> 00:17:18,685
Speaker 2:  of this stuff. Yeah. That said, I do think the button is a good idea.

279
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:23,405
Speaker 4:  Yeah. The button I don't hate, I wish you could reprogram it to do

280
00:17:23,405 --> 00:17:25,365
Speaker 4:  something else. They don't let you do that. Yeah.

281
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,285
Speaker 2:  It should be like the iPhone's action button. Yeah. Like even if you start

282
00:17:28,285 --> 00:17:31,165
Speaker 2:  it as an AI thing, but sort of let me turn it into something else. Fine.

283
00:17:31,395 --> 00:17:35,005
Speaker 4:  Yeah, yeah. Like we would like you to use it for ai but you know,

284
00:17:35,715 --> 00:17:39,325
Speaker 4:  it's your world. Yeah. And I, I kind of sympathize with

285
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:43,605
Speaker 4:  Motorola in that like, it, they're asking you to like create

286
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:47,125
Speaker 4:  some new behaviors with your phone and you have to take a minute and think

287
00:17:47,155 --> 00:17:50,885
Speaker 4:  like, how do we get to the ai? Or if I wanna put this and

288
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:54,925
Speaker 4:  remember this, what am I doing? So they've kind of put it everywhere. I feel

289
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:58,725
Speaker 4:  like an attempt to be like, here you go. But yeah, it,

290
00:17:58,785 --> 00:18:02,125
Speaker 4:  it just gets a little bit like AI overload pretty quickly.

291
00:18:02,545 --> 00:18:05,485
Speaker 2:  That's fair. So I'm gonna ask you the question I ask you every year around

292
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:07,805
Speaker 2:  this time, is this the year, the flip phone

293
00:18:09,285 --> 00:18:09,945
Speaker 4:  Man, I,

294
00:18:09,995 --> 00:18:13,825
Speaker 2:  We're gonna get at least another one from Samsung. Yeah. Sounds like the,

295
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:17,705
Speaker 2:  the flip iPhone, which is probably gonna be a fold iPhone, which I would

296
00:18:17,705 --> 00:18:21,585
Speaker 2:  like to be on the record as saying is a bad decision. Oh is, is a ways

297
00:18:21,645 --> 00:18:25,345
Speaker 2:  out. But like it, it feels like at the very least we are getting to the point

298
00:18:25,345 --> 00:18:29,185
Speaker 2:  where you can credibly say this phone is as good

299
00:18:29,185 --> 00:18:32,265
Speaker 2:  as the other phones you might buy. And also it's a flip phone. Like we're,

300
00:18:32,265 --> 00:18:34,145
Speaker 2:  we're almost there. And that feels important.

301
00:18:34,695 --> 00:18:38,665
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's closure than it's ever been. I think if you've been on the fence

302
00:18:38,665 --> 00:18:42,465
Speaker 4:  about a flip phone and you're pretty sure it's a good idea for you, actually

303
00:18:42,465 --> 00:18:46,145
Speaker 4:  someone in the comments had a good suggestion that you could get

304
00:18:46,285 --> 00:18:50,065
Speaker 4:  one of the like low end razors on a

305
00:18:50,215 --> 00:18:54,065
Speaker 4:  prepaid number for like 250 bucks or

306
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:57,785
Speaker 4:  something. Oh, that's a good idea. Like try that out, see if you like it

307
00:18:58,085 --> 00:19:01,945
Speaker 4:  and then that might be a good way to, you know, get

308
00:19:01,945 --> 00:19:05,265
Speaker 4:  your feet wet without jumping into a $1,300 phone.

309
00:19:05,695 --> 00:19:09,505
Speaker 4:  That, like the couple of things that I hesitate about

310
00:19:09,605 --> 00:19:13,265
Speaker 4:  on the Motorola and all the flip phones right now there,

311
00:19:13,265 --> 00:19:17,065
Speaker 4:  there's no dust protection. There's like teeny tiny

312
00:19:17,345 --> 00:19:21,065
Speaker 4:  particle protection. It's IP 48, but it's still

313
00:19:21,065 --> 00:19:24,985
Speaker 4:  kind of like, I would be a little more careful with this phone than a

314
00:19:24,985 --> 00:19:28,785
Speaker 4:  regular slab phone. I handed it to my 3-year-old and he put his

315
00:19:28,785 --> 00:19:32,585
Speaker 4:  fingers all over the inner screen. Like I was, I didn't go easy on this thing,

316
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:36,625
Speaker 4:  but that's a little bit of a hesitation. I am also a little

317
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:40,185
Speaker 4:  annoyed with Motorola as software policy. They haven't been like

318
00:19:40,635 --> 00:19:44,105
Speaker 4:  super great about rolling out software versions in a

319
00:19:44,245 --> 00:19:48,065
Speaker 4:  timely fashion. They support it for not quite as many

320
00:19:48,065 --> 00:19:51,865
Speaker 4:  years as Samsung. I think they do three OS versions and then

321
00:19:52,695 --> 00:19:55,305
Speaker 4:  four years of security updates, which is like,

322
00:19:55,305 --> 00:19:57,265
Speaker 2:  Which is not as good as its competitors. Yeah,

323
00:19:57,815 --> 00:20:01,705
Speaker 4:  It's okay. Like it'll it'll get most people as far as they wanna go

324
00:20:01,705 --> 00:20:05,625
Speaker 4:  with this phone probably. But yeah, we're getting there. Yeah. I'm like

325
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:09,505
Speaker 4:  if you, if you are pretty sure a flip phone is for you, like It

326
00:20:09,645 --> 00:20:11,265
Speaker 4:  is a great year for the flip phone.

327
00:20:11,935 --> 00:20:14,985
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I was excited to, I got to try yours for a minute.

328
00:20:16,405 --> 00:20:20,065
Speaker 2:  And we're also still at the point where like there is a crease

329
00:20:20,245 --> 00:20:24,105
Speaker 2:  if you look for it in the inside screen, but it's,

330
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:27,265
Speaker 2:  it it continues to go away. Yeah. Like it, which is, which is nice. Like

331
00:20:27,265 --> 00:20:29,545
Speaker 2:  even after a couple minutes of using it, I didn't really notice it anymore.

332
00:20:29,985 --> 00:20:33,705
Speaker 2:  It's still very tall and It is still not quite as good a screen as you get

333
00:20:33,705 --> 00:20:37,465
Speaker 2:  when it's just a regular pane of glass. But like you said, we're getting

334
00:20:37,465 --> 00:20:41,105
Speaker 2:  there. The, the gap gets smaller and smaller every year it seems.

335
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,865
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I'm very excited to see what Samsung does because from a hardware perspective,

336
00:20:44,865 --> 00:20:48,445
Speaker 2:  Samsung has been out in front of this for a long time and I think

337
00:20:48,855 --> 00:20:52,675
Speaker 2:  might might still be the one to get us there.

338
00:20:52,905 --> 00:20:56,475
Speaker 2:  Yeah. But we'll see. That's coming later. So before I let you go, let's talk

339
00:20:56,475 --> 00:21:00,435
Speaker 2:  about the, the Android 16 stuff for just a minute. What do you make of

340
00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:02,635
Speaker 2:  this? We talked a little bit about this on Friday show, but there's a, a

341
00:21:02,635 --> 00:21:06,555
Speaker 2:  new design language for Android. It's very like vibrant and bouncy

342
00:21:06,555 --> 00:21:09,315
Speaker 2:  and colorful. There's a new font.

343
00:21:10,465 --> 00:21:11,915
Speaker 2:  What do you think? What do you make of all this?

344
00:21:12,345 --> 00:21:15,995
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think it's fun. They're calling this material three

345
00:21:16,165 --> 00:21:20,075
Speaker 4:  expressive. It's a big update that's gonna be in the Android in

346
00:21:20,075 --> 00:21:23,515
Speaker 4:  Android 16. It's gonna be in the beta later this month. And

347
00:21:23,935 --> 00:21:27,715
Speaker 4:  we got kind of a little preview of it when Google

348
00:21:28,155 --> 00:21:31,675
Speaker 4:  accidentally posted a blog kind of explaining the

349
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:35,795
Speaker 4:  rationale behind the designs. You know, Google leaking Google stuff

350
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,555
Speaker 4:  is a, a tale as old as time.

351
00:21:37,835 --> 00:21:39,795
Speaker 2:  That's a true tradition of this time of year. Yeah,

352
00:21:40,155 --> 00:21:43,835
Speaker 4:  Right. But there's just a real emphasis in the

353
00:21:44,465 --> 00:21:48,355
Speaker 4:  kind of the appearance of it. It's very, like, they talk about

354
00:21:48,355 --> 00:21:52,035
Speaker 4:  the springy animations and the, the fonts are

355
00:21:52,135 --> 00:21:54,115
Speaker 4:  bolder, the colors are bolder,

356
00:21:55,655 --> 00:21:59,435
Speaker 4:  you know, there's new icon shapes and everything about It is

357
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:02,755
Speaker 4:  just screams like youth, like

358
00:22:03,525 --> 00:22:05,955
Speaker 4:  hello fellow kids kind of thing.

359
00:22:06,695 --> 00:22:09,715
Speaker 2:  Do you think that's the right call? I mean put that next to everything we've

360
00:22:09,715 --> 00:22:13,595
Speaker 2:  seen about what's coming in iOS, which is like very paired

361
00:22:13,595 --> 00:22:17,315
Speaker 2:  down and simple and they're, they're doing a similar kind of like

362
00:22:17,585 --> 00:22:20,555
Speaker 2:  layered three dimensional thing, but it's much more like

363
00:22:21,285 --> 00:22:24,075
Speaker 2:  spaceshipy and glassy and pristine.

364
00:22:24,955 --> 00:22:27,515
Speaker 2:  Android is going all the other way and they're just like, get really weird

365
00:22:27,585 --> 00:22:31,115
Speaker 2:  with what all of this looks like. Do you think that, is that the right

366
00:22:31,425 --> 00:22:34,275
Speaker 2:  call for Android? These things were, we're pushing towards each other for

367
00:22:34,295 --> 00:22:37,835
Speaker 2:  so long. iOS and Android we're looking more and more like every year and

368
00:22:37,835 --> 00:22:41,115
Speaker 2:  now it feels like in a pretty big way. They are absolutely breaking back

369
00:22:41,115 --> 00:22:41,395
Speaker 2:  apart.

370
00:22:41,705 --> 00:22:45,675
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I think it, you know, maybe It is kind of just the nature and

371
00:22:45,825 --> 00:22:49,595
Speaker 4:  they're gonna split apart and come back together again at some point. But

372
00:22:49,795 --> 00:22:53,395
Speaker 4:  I, in my mind, I think yeah, make it look different.

373
00:22:53,935 --> 00:22:57,675
Speaker 4:  iOS has such a stranglehold on the US market

374
00:22:57,975 --> 00:23:01,875
Speaker 4:  and especially among young people. I think we all read a study

375
00:23:02,425 --> 00:23:06,155
Speaker 4:  last year where like 88% of teenagers have an

376
00:23:06,155 --> 00:23:10,115
Speaker 4:  iPhone or something like that. So this feels like an attempt

377
00:23:10,175 --> 00:23:14,115
Speaker 4:  to address that market. And there's a little bit of like inherent

378
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:18,235
Speaker 4:  cringiness I think when a big company sort of

379
00:23:18,435 --> 00:23:22,115
Speaker 4:  approaches a younger demographic and is like, look, we speak your

380
00:23:22,475 --> 00:23:22,635
Speaker 4:  language.

381
00:23:23,215 --> 00:23:26,395
Speaker 2:  How do you do fellow kids is such a sick burn. But also like Exactly Right,

382
00:23:26,395 --> 00:23:27,395
Speaker 2:  right. You are correct about that.

383
00:23:27,425 --> 00:23:31,355
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But, but not, not to kind of dismiss it all as like, oh, they're just

384
00:23:31,415 --> 00:23:35,195
Speaker 4:  trying to like pander to Gen ZI think it's,

385
00:23:35,745 --> 00:23:39,595
Speaker 4:  it's good to refresh things and it seems like they've put a lot of

386
00:23:39,595 --> 00:23:43,155
Speaker 4:  thought into like how do we make this more usable for

387
00:23:43,225 --> 00:23:47,045
Speaker 4:  everybody? And, and I think making something that looks like an

388
00:23:47,185 --> 00:23:51,045
Speaker 4:  an iOS clone is wouldn't be a smart

389
00:23:51,045 --> 00:23:55,005
Speaker 4:  move right now. I think leaning into the difference of like,

390
00:23:55,315 --> 00:23:59,285
Speaker 4:  yeah, this is not an iPhone, this is something else. It, you

391
00:23:59,285 --> 00:24:02,845
Speaker 4:  can make it purple and pink if you want and it looks cool.

392
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:06,085
Speaker 2:  Are you a customizer, by the way, one of the things I've been thinking about

393
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:09,485
Speaker 2:  a lot with this is that there is this big push toward

394
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:13,445
Speaker 2:  letting you do whatever you want with your phone. And I, I keep trying to

395
00:24:13,445 --> 00:24:17,325
Speaker 2:  figure out how to put that next to the thing that we have known and said

396
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:19,605
Speaker 2:  for forever, which is that defaults are the only thing that matter, right?

397
00:24:19,605 --> 00:24:23,485
Speaker 2:  And So I'm like, is this, am I giving these companies too much credit

398
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:27,325
Speaker 2:  for giving people more customization tools that statistically

399
00:24:27,525 --> 00:24:31,445
Speaker 2:  speaking they're never going to use? Or is there something to the

400
00:24:31,445 --> 00:24:35,125
Speaker 2:  idea that actually these things are becoming more personal and more versatile

401
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:38,205
Speaker 2:  and what we should be giving people is more knobs and buttons and options

402
00:24:38,265 --> 00:24:39,045
Speaker 2:  to mess with.

403
00:24:39,635 --> 00:24:43,525
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Maybe it's a good moment to try it, I think. 'cause yeah, I think

404
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:47,005
Speaker 4:  in the past, like I don't super customize

405
00:24:47,505 --> 00:24:51,165
Speaker 4:  my phone. I play around with all the options. I

406
00:24:51,355 --> 00:24:55,005
Speaker 4:  pick one of the color palettes and material you, and,

407
00:24:55,425 --> 00:24:59,405
Speaker 4:  and then I, I'm like, this looks weird. And I just go back to the regular

408
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:03,565
Speaker 4:  one. But maybe kind of as the, as the hardware has

409
00:25:03,565 --> 00:25:06,805
Speaker 4:  just hit a point where, you know, flip phones and folding phones

410
00:25:07,395 --> 00:25:11,325
Speaker 4:  side, they all look the same. Like a Samsung phone, looks like

411
00:25:11,325 --> 00:25:15,285
Speaker 4:  an iPhone, looks like a Yeah. Pixel. Unless you're looking at the camera

412
00:25:15,355 --> 00:25:19,245
Speaker 4:  bump. So maybe that's kind of ripe for

413
00:25:19,245 --> 00:25:23,045
Speaker 4:  like, we'll do something fun and different in the software and people might,

414
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:27,005
Speaker 4:  might actually try these things out if they're like, you know, I, I

415
00:25:27,055 --> 00:25:30,405
Speaker 4:  would like a different color palette. I see more like

416
00:25:30,845 --> 00:25:34,765
Speaker 4:  colorful fun lock iOS lock screens. You know, since Apple made

417
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:38,365
Speaker 4:  that change. I don't believe I've seen anyone

418
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:42,165
Speaker 4:  outside of the, my my fellow like,

419
00:25:42,905 --> 00:25:46,645
Speaker 4:  you know, phone sickos tinting the icons on their

420
00:25:47,035 --> 00:25:50,725
Speaker 4:  home screens. Like Normies are not doing that. I don't think

421
00:25:51,295 --> 00:25:54,365
Speaker 2:  Phone sickos is is the exact correct description of who does that.

422
00:25:54,745 --> 00:25:58,685
Speaker 4:  Yes. And I put myself in that category love lovingly with all, all

423
00:25:58,685 --> 00:26:00,325
Speaker 4:  of my fellow phone sickos. Yeah.

424
00:26:00,555 --> 00:26:03,805
Speaker 2:  With all of these personalizations. My problem is like, and it's like what

425
00:26:03,805 --> 00:26:07,525
Speaker 2:  you said with the material, you colors like 60% of it. I'm like, this looks

426
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:11,405
Speaker 2:  awesome. I love it. It's so cool. And then like four times a day you

427
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:15,365
Speaker 2:  open a screen and it just like, it just feels and looks awful

428
00:26:15,545 --> 00:26:17,965
Speaker 2:  and everything is bad. And I'm like, I'm just gonna go back to the way that

429
00:26:17,965 --> 00:26:21,805
Speaker 2:  it was. And So I think, like my hope is if these

430
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:25,245
Speaker 2:  companies, and Google in particular can stay committed to this idea that

431
00:26:25,245 --> 00:26:29,205
Speaker 2:  it'll actually get developers and users and like wallpaper makers and everybody

432
00:26:29,385 --> 00:26:32,925
Speaker 2:  to buy into this way of thinking about what a phone should look like

433
00:26:33,785 --> 00:26:37,685
Speaker 2:  and start to solve some of those edge cases. 'cause right now it's like half

434
00:26:37,685 --> 00:26:41,045
Speaker 2:  the icons on my screen look great in whatever color I've chosen. Yeah. And

435
00:26:41,045 --> 00:26:44,765
Speaker 2:  the other half look like butts. Yeah. And you're like, you gotta fix that.

436
00:26:45,175 --> 00:26:46,925
Speaker 4:  Right. Fix the buts, please

437
00:26:47,185 --> 00:26:51,045
Speaker 2:  Fix the buts and then Android will be perfect. Is my takeaway. Exactly.

438
00:26:51,825 --> 00:26:55,405
Speaker 2:  So Android 16 coming this year seems like it, it might be the

439
00:26:55,795 --> 00:26:59,725
Speaker 2:  most interesting Android in a minute. Like it's been a while since we had

440
00:26:59,725 --> 00:27:02,285
Speaker 2:  an Android that you sort of update your phone and look at it and go, oh,

441
00:27:02,285 --> 00:27:05,205
Speaker 2:  it's different now. This feels like it might do it. And I'm excited about

442
00:27:05,205 --> 00:27:05,325
Speaker 2:  that.

443
00:27:05,715 --> 00:27:08,845
Speaker 4:  Yeah, me too. And there's, there's other stuff. They've got kind of like

444
00:27:08,965 --> 00:27:12,005
Speaker 4:  a, a live activities thing. There's gonna be

445
00:27:13,585 --> 00:27:17,565
Speaker 4:  new haptics and all that. It's gonna look and feel and do different things.

446
00:27:17,865 --> 00:27:20,645
Speaker 4:  So Yeah, it's been a minute. I I'm excited for that.

447
00:27:21,105 --> 00:27:23,485
Speaker 2:  Me too. All right, well we gotta take a break and then we're gonna come back.

448
00:27:23,485 --> 00:27:25,885
Speaker 2:  We're gonna talk about Snapchat. Allison, thank you as always.

449
00:27:26,095 --> 00:27:26,565
Speaker 4:  Thank you.

450
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:30,745
Speaker 2:  All right. I made a mistake. I hung up on Allison before we did one thing

451
00:27:30,745 --> 00:27:32,585
Speaker 2:  that Allison asked. So Allison's back. Hi Allison,

452
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:33,465
Speaker 4:  I'm back.

453
00:27:34,165 --> 00:27:36,385
Speaker 2:  You, you had a special request for the people.

454
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:37,185
Speaker 4:  I do.

455
00:27:37,645 --> 00:27:38,145
Speaker 2:  What's up?

456
00:27:38,585 --> 00:27:42,385
Speaker 4:  I have the great honor of hosting a couple episodes of The

457
00:27:42,545 --> 00:27:46,265
Speaker 4:  Vergecast this summer and something I wanna do is

458
00:27:46,605 --> 00:27:50,385
Speaker 4:  ask all of you to let me know your phone buying

459
00:27:51,195 --> 00:27:54,625
Speaker 4:  conundrums. I wanna hear from people who are

460
00:27:55,665 --> 00:27:59,145
Speaker 4:  considering a new phone who are stuck between two phones

461
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:03,665
Speaker 4:  who don't wanna upgrade their iPhone mini.

462
00:28:04,345 --> 00:28:08,145
Speaker 4:  I see you, I am one of you. This can be

463
00:28:08,825 --> 00:28:12,665
Speaker 4:  a pep talk, this can be therapy. I can help you talk through a buying decision.

464
00:28:13,465 --> 00:28:17,425
Speaker 4:  I spend all day thinking about what phone people should buy. So

465
00:28:17,425 --> 00:28:21,385
Speaker 4:  this is like, I'm just like itching to provide this service. So

466
00:28:21,975 --> 00:28:25,905
Speaker 4:  send me your, your questions, your, your troubles. I would

467
00:28:25,905 --> 00:28:26,465
Speaker 4:  like to hear them.

468
00:28:27,385 --> 00:28:31,225
Speaker 2:  I love this. I'm gonna call and ask you if it's actually time

469
00:28:31,225 --> 00:28:34,225
Speaker 2:  for me to give up on the iPhone and switch to Android. If I should go through

470
00:28:34,385 --> 00:28:37,225
Speaker 2:  the pain of leaving iMessage once and for all. That's mine.

471
00:28:37,855 --> 00:28:40,665
Speaker 4:  Okay. That'll be a a 60 minute segment. So

472
00:28:42,535 --> 00:28:45,905
Speaker 2:  Cool. And so yeah, same way as always. Call the hotline. Eight six six version

473
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:49,905
Speaker 2:  one one email Vergecast The Verge dot com. Yeah, you and a

474
00:28:49,905 --> 00:28:52,585
Speaker 2:  bunch of folks are gonna have a lot of fun on this show over the summer and

475
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:53,385
Speaker 2:  I'm very excited.

476
00:28:53,855 --> 00:28:55,505
Speaker 4:  It's gonna rule. I'm so excited.

477
00:28:56,075 --> 00:28:56,945
Speaker 2:  Sweet. All

478
00:30:16,095 --> 00:30:18,875
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Alex Heath is here. Hi Alex.

479
00:30:19,415 --> 00:30:19,995
Speaker 5:  Hey Devon.

480
00:30:20,575 --> 00:30:24,045
Speaker 2:  So as we do from time to time, you and I need to talk about Snapchat.

481
00:30:24,955 --> 00:30:28,845
Speaker 2:  It's possible that you and I are the only people in the news business who

482
00:30:28,845 --> 00:30:31,885
Speaker 2:  care about Snapchat, which is I think part of the point. But I care deeply

483
00:30:31,885 --> 00:30:35,725
Speaker 2:  about Snapchat and I wanna talk about it. So I think we should probably

484
00:30:35,725 --> 00:30:39,685
Speaker 2:  start like last fall because Snapchat launches

485
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:43,605
Speaker 2:  this big or announces that they're doing this big redesign, kind of a

486
00:30:43,605 --> 00:30:47,445
Speaker 2:  whole new way of thinking about Snapchat. I think they called it simple Snapchat.

487
00:30:48,545 --> 00:30:51,445
Speaker 2:  And you, you like understood what was going on at the time. And I think we

488
00:30:51,445 --> 00:30:54,365
Speaker 2:  talked about it a little bit but refresh our memory a little bit. Like what

489
00:30:54,365 --> 00:30:57,405
Speaker 2:  was Snapchat trying to do with this big change last fall?

490
00:30:58,075 --> 00:31:01,845
Speaker 5:  Yeah, Snapchat started as a pretty simple disappearing messaging app

491
00:31:01,865 --> 00:31:05,645
Speaker 5:  and over the years they added on a lot of stuff. There's a

492
00:31:05,705 --> 00:31:09,525
Speaker 5:  map where you can see where your friends are in the app. There's

493
00:31:09,765 --> 00:31:13,605
Speaker 5:  memories, which is essentially their own camera roll experience. There's

494
00:31:14,165 --> 00:31:17,845
Speaker 5:  Discover, which was their really early take on

495
00:31:18,225 --> 00:31:22,125
Speaker 5:  how a publishing environment can work in a visual messaging

496
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:25,605
Speaker 5:  application. And then they were doing Spotlight, which was their

497
00:31:26,025 --> 00:31:29,685
Speaker 5:  TikTok video, you know, full screen swipe up and down

498
00:31:29,735 --> 00:31:32,605
Speaker 5:  competitor. And it was just a lot. That

499
00:31:32,845 --> 00:31:34,005
Speaker 2:  Is a lot of stuff. Yeah.

500
00:31:34,315 --> 00:31:37,685
Speaker 5:  They're also scaling beyond their core

501
00:31:37,685 --> 00:31:40,885
Speaker 5:  demographic of young people and I think

502
00:31:41,575 --> 00:31:45,165
Speaker 5:  older people and don't want a ton of tabs. And so the idea was,

503
00:31:45,295 --> 00:31:49,045
Speaker 5:  let's condense all of this. They really need their content business,

504
00:31:49,145 --> 00:31:52,965
Speaker 5:  the video business spotlight and discover to get bigger

505
00:31:53,265 --> 00:31:56,805
Speaker 5:  and be more culturally relevant. And the idea was let's just

506
00:31:57,045 --> 00:32:00,845
Speaker 5:  simplify everything to three tabs messaging the camera Snap always

507
00:32:00,845 --> 00:32:03,925
Speaker 5:  opens to the camera and then on the right you would have

508
00:32:05,145 --> 00:32:09,085
Speaker 5:  all of the video content and publish or content merged together into just

509
00:32:09,145 --> 00:32:13,085
Speaker 5:  one feed like Reels or TikTok. And this was, you know, meant

510
00:32:13,085 --> 00:32:16,565
Speaker 5:  to not only appease investors by making the video business more front and

511
00:32:16,565 --> 00:32:20,525
Speaker 5:  center, but hopefully make the app more intuitive and encourage

512
00:32:20,595 --> 00:32:24,125
Speaker 5:  more people to not just message their friends on Snap but

513
00:32:24,775 --> 00:32:28,725
Speaker 5:  watch video, watch stuff from creators, watch stuff from

514
00:32:28,725 --> 00:32:29,165
Speaker 5:  publishers.

515
00:32:29,905 --> 00:32:33,685
Speaker 2:  The theory of that still, even as you describe it, strikes me as a good

516
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,685
Speaker 2:  idea. Yeah. That I think like Snap's whole thing has been

517
00:32:37,545 --> 00:32:40,540
Speaker 2:  trying to do all of this in one place makes sense. Right? And I think we,

518
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:43,845
Speaker 2:  you, you can sort of litigate that forever if the messaging app and the content

519
00:32:44,205 --> 00:32:47,965
Speaker 2:  business should have been fully separate products. But Snap

520
00:32:48,025 --> 00:32:51,645
Speaker 2:  has believed that they should be at least next to each other for a very long

521
00:32:51,645 --> 00:32:55,565
Speaker 2:  time. And the idea of like camera in the middle, talk to your friends

522
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:59,565
Speaker 2:  on one side, public facing video feed on the other

523
00:32:59,565 --> 00:33:03,285
Speaker 2:  side like that, that makes sense to me. That is like, that is the Snapchat

524
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:07,155
Speaker 2:  that seems like it could work and yet, and

525
00:33:07,155 --> 00:33:11,035
Speaker 2:  yet they, they in an earnings report just recently, they just

526
00:33:11,415 --> 00:33:14,475
Speaker 2:  bailed on that whole entire idea what is happening here.

527
00:33:15,705 --> 00:33:19,545
Speaker 5:  I think Snap is really struggling to execute, especially over

528
00:33:19,545 --> 00:33:22,645
Speaker 5:  the last, I would say five years really.

529
00:33:23,215 --> 00:33:27,005
Speaker 5:  There was a moment where it seemed like they were inventing all these new

530
00:33:27,115 --> 00:33:30,645
Speaker 5:  formats, really looking ahead to where social media was going. Everyone was

531
00:33:30,645 --> 00:33:33,605
Speaker 5:  copying them. And lately It is just been a lot of

532
00:33:34,795 --> 00:33:37,845
Speaker 5:  executional business strategy

533
00:33:38,805 --> 00:33:42,645
Speaker 5:  mishaps. And what happened with this simple Snapchat rollout was

534
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:46,365
Speaker 5:  that it was really hurting engagement with the

535
00:33:46,645 --> 00:33:50,005
Speaker 5:  audience that consumes content the most, which was the opposite of what they

536
00:33:50,005 --> 00:33:52,885
Speaker 5:  wanted to happen. And because Snap is so already

537
00:33:53,355 --> 00:33:57,165
Speaker 5:  financially on the rocks, they can't

538
00:33:57,165 --> 00:34:01,005
Speaker 5:  take huge swings like they used to, like when they redesigned

539
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:04,525
Speaker 5:  the app right after they iPod and then Kylie Jenner posted about how it sucked

540
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:07,485
Speaker 5:  and you know, the stock tanked and all of that. Right.

541
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:09,365
Speaker 2:  You can't really afford another one of those. Yeah.

542
00:34:09,365 --> 00:34:13,285
Speaker 5:  They stuck with it at the time and now they're just so beholden

543
00:34:13,345 --> 00:34:16,685
Speaker 5:  to Wall Street and quarterly earnings and proving that they can actually

544
00:34:16,685 --> 00:34:19,925
Speaker 5:  be a real business that they can't afford to tank

545
00:34:20,735 --> 00:34:24,285
Speaker 5:  their business with a redesign like this even if they think it's the thing

546
00:34:24,285 --> 00:34:27,005
Speaker 5:  that's gonna work in the long run. So yeah, it was a big swing and a miss.

547
00:34:27,635 --> 00:34:31,085
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it and it does feel like that tension you describe

548
00:34:31,895 --> 00:34:35,805
Speaker 2:  might be just unsolvable at some point for Snapchat because It is the, the

549
00:34:35,805 --> 00:34:39,765
Speaker 2:  two things that keep happening are like, especially for young users,

550
00:34:40,475 --> 00:34:44,045
Speaker 2:  they're growing up and continuing to use Snapchat and there is like a, there

551
00:34:44,045 --> 00:34:47,765
Speaker 2:  is a world in which Snapchat is more and more sort of culturally

552
00:34:47,765 --> 00:34:51,165
Speaker 2:  important to vast numbers of people

553
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:55,485
Speaker 2:  than ever. Like It is, It is a, a communication tool that like

554
00:34:55,485 --> 00:34:58,845
Speaker 2:  several generations of people now use all day every day.

555
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:02,925
Speaker 2:  And that is very important and very powerful. And yet Snapchat cannot figure

556
00:35:02,945 --> 00:35:06,925
Speaker 2:  out how to make a single nickel off of that entire thing. And

557
00:35:06,925 --> 00:35:10,565
Speaker 2:  so it just seems like it's, it's now stuck in this

558
00:35:10,885 --> 00:35:14,845
Speaker 2:  business of trying to be TikTok or reels

559
00:35:15,795 --> 00:35:17,205
Speaker 2:  when TikTok and reels exist.

560
00:35:17,795 --> 00:35:20,925
Speaker 5:  Well let's give them a little credit. They make more than a nickel.

561
00:35:22,185 --> 00:35:24,285
Speaker 5:  How, how much revenue do you think they made last quarter?

562
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:26,405
Speaker 2:  Well that's an interesting question.

563
00:35:27,605 --> 00:35:29,685
Speaker 5:  I wanna ask you that. And then how many users do you think they have?

564
00:35:31,605 --> 00:35:33,485
Speaker 5:  I think the audience will be surprised by both of these.

565
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:38,245
Speaker 2:  I'm gonna guess there's more users than revenue. It

566
00:35:38,245 --> 00:35:41,165
Speaker 5:  Would be actually no, but they're close. Okay.

567
00:35:42,205 --> 00:35:45,125
Speaker 2:  I think I'm give the numbers. I'm I'm gonna bet it's, I'm gonna bet it's

568
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:46,045
Speaker 2:  less than I would've thought a

569
00:35:46,045 --> 00:35:49,725
Speaker 5:  Annually. Yes. But quarterly. So they're, they're doing about 1.3 billion

570
00:35:49,885 --> 00:35:51,645
Speaker 5:  a year in Rev in a quarter in revenue

571
00:35:51,905 --> 00:35:54,445
Speaker 2:  That's higher than I would've guessed. I was gonna guess like high hundred

572
00:35:54,445 --> 00:35:55,005
Speaker 2:  millions.

573
00:35:55,005 --> 00:35:58,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And they've surpassed 900 million monthly active users.

574
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:02,285
Speaker 5:  So they're rapidly approaching a billion users. Over

575
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,325
Speaker 5:  460 million of those are daily.

576
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:07,725
Speaker 2:  That's huge like that that those are giant numbers

577
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:11,365
Speaker 5:  Significantly larger than X. It's in the same ballpark is like

578
00:36:11,485 --> 00:36:15,125
Speaker 5:  Telegram maybe bigger, obviously Meta's

579
00:36:15,325 --> 00:36:19,045
Speaker 5:  platforms are are larger, but in terms of like independent

580
00:36:19,045 --> 00:36:22,045
Speaker 5:  social media, it's by far the biggest. Yeah.

581
00:36:22,955 --> 00:36:24,375
Speaker 5:  And at the same time,

582
00:36:26,605 --> 00:36:29,975
Speaker 5:  snap stock price, if you pull it up from when they went public, God

583
00:36:30,485 --> 00:36:34,215
Speaker 5:  what is it like 10 ish years ago is, is negative.

584
00:36:35,315 --> 00:36:39,175
Speaker 5:  So this is a business that has gone sideways over the last decade while at

585
00:36:39,175 --> 00:36:42,495
Speaker 5:  the same time scaling its user base by a dramatic,

586
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:46,855
Speaker 5:  you know, percentage. And I think that just goes to show that

587
00:36:47,315 --> 00:36:50,825
Speaker 5:  maybe the thesis of this conversation too, that maybe you can't make money

588
00:36:51,045 --> 00:36:52,625
Speaker 5:  off of messaging. I dunno.

589
00:36:53,215 --> 00:36:57,145
Speaker 2:  Well yeah, I mean I guess is it, would you chalk that

590
00:36:57,285 --> 00:37:01,225
Speaker 2:  up to like you said, sort of pure executional failure? Like is this

591
00:37:01,225 --> 00:37:05,065
Speaker 2:  just a function of not having a very good sales team or like, or is

592
00:37:05,065 --> 00:37:08,585
Speaker 2:  there something kind of fundamentally different about what

593
00:37:09,025 --> 00:37:12,025
Speaker 2:  Snapchat is and who it's reaching that

594
00:37:12,775 --> 00:37:15,225
Speaker 2:  just doesn't work the same way that it has for other companies?

595
00:37:16,115 --> 00:37:20,035
Speaker 5:  I think it's a mix of all of that. Okay. I think it's really hard to compete

596
00:37:20,035 --> 00:37:23,235
Speaker 5:  with a platform like Meta that has over 10 million advertisers

597
00:37:23,915 --> 00:37:27,715
Speaker 5:  platforms with billions of users and it's just been grinding on the ads

598
00:37:27,765 --> 00:37:31,555
Speaker 5:  stuff. And now ai which is increasingly

599
00:37:31,555 --> 00:37:35,475
Speaker 5:  getting intertwined with ads for much longer at a much larger

600
00:37:35,895 --> 00:37:39,795
Speaker 5:  run rate. And you know, I think Snap also has been

601
00:37:39,795 --> 00:37:43,315
Speaker 5:  kind of precious about things for far too long. It is now finally

602
00:37:43,315 --> 00:37:47,115
Speaker 5:  realizing it needs to be a real business. And I think that

603
00:37:47,245 --> 00:37:50,235
Speaker 5:  delay in getting there really cost them.

604
00:37:51,575 --> 00:37:55,555
Speaker 5:  And you know, snap, I, I've been covering Snap since before they

605
00:37:55,555 --> 00:37:59,435
Speaker 5:  went public when they were a very small startup. The headlines like,

606
00:37:59,495 --> 00:38:02,595
Speaker 5:  is Snapchat dead? Is Snapchat cooks? You know,

607
00:38:03,195 --> 00:38:06,875
Speaker 5:  Snapchat's almost dead have been written many times. I've written them many

608
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:09,875
Speaker 5:  times the company has still held on, but

609
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:14,845
Speaker 5:  it's definitely not what everyone hoped it would be. And

610
00:38:15,705 --> 00:38:19,685
Speaker 5:  you know, they've tried ways to monetize. They've got

611
00:38:20,085 --> 00:38:23,445
Speaker 5:  Snapchat Plus now, which is a subscription that has 15 million

612
00:38:23,965 --> 00:38:27,925
Speaker 5:  subscribers where you get a bunch of extra things in the app. Their ads

613
00:38:28,245 --> 00:38:32,045
Speaker 5:  business is meaningful. It's nowhere near Meta or Google's, but it's, it's

614
00:38:32,045 --> 00:38:35,645
Speaker 5:  meaningful. It's nothing to completely thumb up, but

615
00:38:36,195 --> 00:38:38,925
Speaker 5:  they're just still really struggling to figure out how to

616
00:38:39,805 --> 00:38:43,085
Speaker 5:  monetize the app effectively. And for the longest time they just weren't

617
00:38:43,085 --> 00:38:46,525
Speaker 5:  monetizing the main way people use the app, which is messaging.

618
00:38:47,065 --> 00:38:50,445
Speaker 5:  And recently they started putting ads in chat and they're testing that, but

619
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:54,565
Speaker 5:  they don't want to tank the metrics of messaging either. 'cause that's their

620
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:58,525
Speaker 5:  core business. So there's just a lot of, they're, they're trying to

621
00:38:58,525 --> 00:39:01,245
Speaker 5:  do a lot because messaging and

622
00:39:02,865 --> 00:39:06,765
Speaker 5:  all of that that it entails and really talking to friends is

623
00:39:06,765 --> 00:39:08,005
Speaker 5:  just really hard to put ads in.

624
00:39:08,685 --> 00:39:12,495
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Well and then next to all of that is, is this thing

625
00:39:12,495 --> 00:39:16,375
Speaker 2:  that Snap has been trying to sell itself as for years now, which is that

626
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:19,975
Speaker 2:  Snap is a camera company, right? That, that actually we're not about messaging,

627
00:39:20,145 --> 00:39:22,775
Speaker 2:  we're not about Spotlight, we're not about any of this other stuff. We're

628
00:39:22,775 --> 00:39:26,415
Speaker 2:  about camera. And I think I bought that

629
00:39:26,555 --> 00:39:29,535
Speaker 2:  for a long time and I think still to this day, like if you wanna talk about

630
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:33,495
Speaker 2:  who is doing the most interesting ar camera stuff, I think it's probably

631
00:39:33,495 --> 00:39:36,775
Speaker 2:  still Snap. The problem is just no one cares.

632
00:39:37,315 --> 00:39:41,295
Speaker 2:  And I think, I think either we're still too early and this is happening more

633
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,375
Speaker 2:  slowly than we realized.

634
00:39:43,995 --> 00:39:47,855
Speaker 2:  And I mean the, the first generation of spectacles was 10 years ago and like

635
00:39:48,325 --> 00:39:52,135
Speaker 2:  Snap has just been at this a long time and the the world

636
00:39:52,235 --> 00:39:55,855
Speaker 2:  has not caught up to Snap. And either it's gonna happen slower than anybody

637
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:59,815
Speaker 2:  bet on or it's just not gonna happen at all. And I, I

638
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:03,495
Speaker 2:  used to think with confidence that it was just that it was happening

639
00:40:03,495 --> 00:40:06,735
Speaker 2:  slower. And I'm starting to wonder more and more if it's just not gonna happen

640
00:40:06,835 --> 00:40:07,135
Speaker 2:  at all.

641
00:40:07,315 --> 00:40:09,415
Speaker 5:  You know, they don't call themselves a camera company anymore.

642
00:40:09,755 --> 00:40:10,335
Speaker 2:  Did that change?

643
00:40:10,685 --> 00:40:13,695
Speaker 5:  They dropped it, yeah. Interesting. They dropped around the time they were

644
00:40:14,215 --> 00:40:17,455
Speaker 5:  redesigning the app and trying to really become an ads business. Now they're

645
00:40:17,455 --> 00:40:19,015
Speaker 5:  just a regular old tech company.

646
00:40:19,285 --> 00:40:22,775
Speaker 2:  They're just Snapchat again. Yeah. That feels very telling to me. Well

647
00:40:22,775 --> 00:40:25,655
Speaker 5:  I mean they, they, they still open to the camera and spectacles is still

648
00:40:25,655 --> 00:40:29,175
Speaker 5:  very much to the chagrin of their investors. A serious

649
00:40:29,435 --> 00:40:32,415
Speaker 5:  bet that Evan Spiegel the CO is very focused on.

650
00:40:34,035 --> 00:40:37,815
Speaker 5:  But yeah, they're, they're playing in a land of giants there. Right.

651
00:40:38,715 --> 00:40:42,335
Speaker 5:  And gosh, you think back to like the yellow vending

652
00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:46,295
Speaker 5:  machines, the first spectacles drop, how buzzy that was

653
00:40:48,355 --> 00:40:52,095
Speaker 5:  and it kind of is Snap in a nutshell. They created a lot of buzz. They did

654
00:40:52,095 --> 00:40:56,055
Speaker 5:  something pretty early that was foreshadowing what was

655
00:40:56,075 --> 00:40:59,975
Speaker 5:  to come right now with the meta Ray bands camera glasses finally

656
00:40:59,975 --> 00:41:03,735
Speaker 5:  taking off 10 years later. But at the same time

657
00:41:03,845 --> 00:41:07,375
Speaker 5:  they wildly overshot the demand and ended up

658
00:41:07,445 --> 00:41:11,175
Speaker 5:  costing them like 40 million in unsold inventory because they bought way

659
00:41:11,175 --> 00:41:14,855
Speaker 5:  more spectacles thinking this thing was gonna scale way faster. Right. And

660
00:41:14,855 --> 00:41:18,695
Speaker 5:  then it didn't, and then they've like reset that division like 14

661
00:41:18,695 --> 00:41:21,775
Speaker 5:  times since then. Yeah. So it's just this repeat

662
00:41:22,675 --> 00:41:26,165
Speaker 5:  pattern of good ideas that are probably too early

663
00:41:27,945 --> 00:41:31,925
Speaker 5:  and then messing up on the execution. I don't know how else to say it. Yeah.

664
00:41:32,225 --> 00:41:35,645
Speaker 5:  And when you look at how messaging apps are

665
00:41:35,675 --> 00:41:39,025
Speaker 5:  monetized, meta is probably the best example.

666
00:41:40,055 --> 00:41:43,745
Speaker 5:  They actually monetize it through ads on their other apps. So Meta has this

667
00:41:43,745 --> 00:41:47,505
Speaker 5:  conglomerate where ads that point people to me

668
00:41:47,575 --> 00:41:51,345
Speaker 5:  with businesses and WhatsApp and Messenger is a 10 billion a year

669
00:41:51,585 --> 00:41:55,325
Speaker 5:  business. And those ads don't show up in

670
00:41:55,565 --> 00:41:58,605
Speaker 5:  WhatsApp or Messenger. They show up on Facebook and Instagram and they point

671
00:41:58,605 --> 00:42:02,565
Speaker 5:  people to those apps. So Meta has built this flywheel with these

672
00:42:02,565 --> 00:42:06,525
Speaker 5:  products that serve different purposes that point to each other and

673
00:42:06,525 --> 00:42:10,325
Speaker 5:  that's how they're monetizing messaging. And then the only other really

674
00:42:10,615 --> 00:42:14,365
Speaker 5:  meaningful way that someone has ma monetized

675
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,925
Speaker 5:  messaging besides that would be like a Discord or a

676
00:42:17,925 --> 00:42:21,405
Speaker 5:  Telegram, which is, they're smaller still pretty

677
00:42:21,645 --> 00:42:24,725
Speaker 5:  subscription based. Most of the revenue Telegram made last year was actually

678
00:42:24,725 --> 00:42:28,485
Speaker 5:  from crypto, from its crypto holdings. It has this weird cryptocurrency

679
00:42:28,515 --> 00:42:29,725
Speaker 5:  that you can use in the app.

680
00:42:29,905 --> 00:42:30,485
Speaker 2:  Sounds right.

681
00:42:31,425 --> 00:42:35,365
Speaker 5:  So no one has figured out ads in a messaging environment. Yeah. And for years,

682
00:42:36,065 --> 00:42:39,805
Speaker 5:  up until the last couple years when they started testing ads in chat on Snapchat,

683
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:43,525
Speaker 5:  all the people at Snap I would talk to would be like, we are never going

684
00:42:43,525 --> 00:42:46,885
Speaker 5:  to really crack revenue growth until we figure out how to

685
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:50,805
Speaker 5:  monetize that messaging tab. And they're trying now. But,

686
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:54,445
Speaker 5:  you know, we'll see, I think rolling back the, the discover the content piece

687
00:42:54,445 --> 00:42:58,405
Speaker 5:  back to where it was is a sign that that video business

688
00:42:58,705 --> 00:43:01,805
Speaker 5:  and the ads that could go in there, which are make a lot of money for Instagram

689
00:43:01,805 --> 00:43:05,365
Speaker 5:  and TikTok are also gonna be a slower

690
00:43:05,755 --> 00:43:09,285
Speaker 5:  role for Snap. So yeah, it's just a challenging time for them.

691
00:43:09,835 --> 00:43:13,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Well, and I think you, you, you bring up a broader point about sort

692
00:43:13,365 --> 00:43:16,525
Speaker 2:  of consumer messaging apps that I've been thinking about a lot because it

693
00:43:16,525 --> 00:43:20,485
Speaker 2:  keeps coming up in this meta trial too, where on the one hand, you

694
00:43:20,485 --> 00:43:23,725
Speaker 2:  know, there's all these conversations about Instagram and whether Meta helped

695
00:43:23,745 --> 00:43:27,165
Speaker 2:  or hindered Instagram. And then on the WhatsApp side it's just like, it was

696
00:43:27,165 --> 00:43:30,405
Speaker 2:  just this tiny lifestyle business that had no interest in making money and

697
00:43:30,405 --> 00:43:33,725
Speaker 2:  no plans to make money and was never gonna make any money. And then Meta

698
00:43:33,725 --> 00:43:37,485
Speaker 2:  bought it and like supercharged it as a business, but, but like not really.

699
00:43:37,585 --> 00:43:40,205
Speaker 2:  And for a long time Meta didn't make any money and they spent a ton of money

700
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:44,965
Speaker 2:  on WhatsApp and now they're just starting to, like you said, sort

701
00:43:44,965 --> 00:43:47,605
Speaker 2:  of turn the screws on how to make money off of this giant platform that you

702
00:43:47,605 --> 00:43:51,525
Speaker 2:  have. And it's just made me wonder like we are at a moment

703
00:43:51,575 --> 00:43:54,365
Speaker 2:  right now where I think you could argue that

704
00:43:55,255 --> 00:43:59,025
Speaker 2:  messaging like person to person messaging, group chats and

705
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:02,585
Speaker 2:  and texts and whatever is like the single most important thing

706
00:44:03,205 --> 00:44:07,145
Speaker 2:  we do in, in our online lives right now. It is, It

707
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:10,825
Speaker 2:  is how we communicate in, in so many ways and it just

708
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:14,865
Speaker 2:  isn't a business for anybody. Like I, as far as I can tell, no one

709
00:44:15,005 --> 00:44:18,545
Speaker 2:  has figured out how to directly monetize letting you and I talk to each other

710
00:44:18,605 --> 00:44:22,425
Speaker 2:  on the internet. No one, you either have to subsidize it

711
00:44:22,445 --> 00:44:26,185
Speaker 2:  by making me buy an iPhone and making it really hard for me to leave. You

712
00:44:26,185 --> 00:44:29,425
Speaker 2:  have to find some, like you said, sort of ancillary way to

713
00:44:29,935 --> 00:44:33,865
Speaker 2:  like you, you sell ads where you put your

714
00:44:33,865 --> 00:44:37,305
Speaker 2:  number that I can text you, which is not the same, but, so I'm like, I've

715
00:44:37,305 --> 00:44:41,135
Speaker 2:  reached a point now where it's like, is this, is there just not a business

716
00:44:41,955 --> 00:44:45,855
Speaker 2:  in chat? And if that's true, is that a problem? And

717
00:44:45,855 --> 00:44:49,535
Speaker 2:  it feels like downstream from this that feels like it might be because then

718
00:44:49,695 --> 00:44:52,495
Speaker 2:  you look at somebody like Snap who is like, oh, what we have to do is we

719
00:44:52,495 --> 00:44:56,335
Speaker 2:  have to actually just ruin the experience for you in order to make any money

720
00:44:56,355 --> 00:44:56,855
Speaker 2:  off of this.

721
00:44:57,295 --> 00:45:00,455
Speaker 5:  I think it's a problem for people who can't build something around it like

722
00:45:00,725 --> 00:45:04,295
Speaker 5:  Snap right now you're right. Like Apple doesn't make money off iMessage,

723
00:45:04,295 --> 00:45:05,815
Speaker 5:  but iMessage helps 'em sell iPhones

724
00:45:07,715 --> 00:45:11,575
Speaker 5:  and Google with its many, many messaging apps I'm

725
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:13,735
Speaker 5:  sure makes money indirectly from those

726
00:45:13,765 --> 00:45:15,135
Speaker 2:  Messaging apps. Maybe I don know

727
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:18,815
Speaker 5:  Maybe who knows, but they probably don't even know. But yeah, it's, I mean

728
00:45:18,815 --> 00:45:22,415
Speaker 5:  do you remember when Snap was doing mini games and a little mini app store

729
00:45:22,415 --> 00:45:26,295
Speaker 5:  and they were trying to be WeChat and have all these

730
00:45:26,565 --> 00:45:30,375
Speaker 5:  apps and they bought like gaming studios and

731
00:45:30,375 --> 00:45:33,935
Speaker 5:  you could That's right. Yeah, you could and you could transact to these mini

732
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:34,255
Speaker 5:  apps

733
00:45:34,555 --> 00:45:37,815
Speaker 2:  And all that was gonna be stuff you could like invoke inside the chat, right?

734
00:45:37,845 --> 00:45:41,655
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And they shut that down too. And so they've tried,

735
00:45:41,895 --> 00:45:43,335
Speaker 5:  I mean they've tried a lot of things.

736
00:45:44,855 --> 00:45:48,415
Speaker 5:  I think for them they have to get the content piece down. They have, I mean

737
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:51,375
Speaker 5:  they have creators that are huge on Snap, you know, David Dorich, people

738
00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:55,135
Speaker 5:  like that that have millions of followers make a lot of money, but it's

739
00:45:55,135 --> 00:45:59,055
Speaker 5:  just not culturally relevant like TikTok or even reels. And

740
00:45:59,055 --> 00:46:02,575
Speaker 5:  that's a problem for them. Maybe they don't see it that way, but I think

741
00:46:02,575 --> 00:46:06,135
Speaker 5:  It is. And they also have this

742
00:46:06,495 --> 00:46:10,455
Speaker 5:  relationship with publishers where they share ad revenue with a bunch of

743
00:46:10,455 --> 00:46:13,455
Speaker 5:  publishers. Vox Media was in this at one point. I'm not sure if we still

744
00:46:13,455 --> 00:46:17,335
Speaker 5:  are. And that also just feels

745
00:46:17,335 --> 00:46:21,015
Speaker 5:  like that entire chess board of publishers

746
00:46:21,015 --> 00:46:24,615
Speaker 5:  relationships with platforms is fraught.

747
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:28,375
Speaker 5:  So I think the real hail Mary

748
00:46:29,035 --> 00:46:32,895
Speaker 5:  bet is that spectacles will work, eventually Snap

749
00:46:32,925 --> 00:46:36,775
Speaker 5:  will be able to transition to what Spiegel and to his

750
00:46:36,775 --> 00:46:40,655
Speaker 5:  credit, Tim Cook, Merck Zuckerberg, Senator Pacha also agree is

751
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:43,295
Speaker 5:  maybe the next platform AR glasses. Sure It

752
00:46:43,295 --> 00:46:44,375
Speaker 2:  Is the bet for sure.

753
00:46:44,685 --> 00:46:48,175
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And that, that will be the thing that gives them

754
00:46:48,345 --> 00:46:52,295
Speaker 5:  their next 10 to 20 years. Now I've written about this,

755
00:46:52,395 --> 00:46:56,055
Speaker 5:  I'm very skeptical of their ability to compete. I would love to see a smaller

756
00:46:56,055 --> 00:46:59,615
Speaker 5:  player, especially one like Snap that's been pretty innovative with the products.

757
00:46:59,615 --> 00:47:03,375
Speaker 5:  It does stay in the space and challenge the the Giants,

758
00:47:04,035 --> 00:47:07,855
Speaker 5:  but with their financial profile right now it's such a

759
00:47:07,855 --> 00:47:11,255
Speaker 5:  capital intensive business to do hardware well at scale.

760
00:47:12,005 --> 00:47:14,775
Speaker 5:  It's very hard. It's a very hard uphill thing. I'm like, their last spectacles

761
00:47:14,775 --> 00:47:18,575
Speaker 5:  that I tried last year, you know, they're not even for sale, right? They're

762
00:47:18,575 --> 00:47:22,335
Speaker 5:  just letting developers try them and you know, I think they'll do a consumer

763
00:47:22,335 --> 00:47:25,415
Speaker 5:  version in maybe the next year or two, but

764
00:47:26,155 --> 00:47:28,855
Speaker 5:  you know, it's gonna cost a lot. They're not gonna be able to make a ton

765
00:47:28,855 --> 00:47:32,845
Speaker 5:  of them. It'll still be an early adopter thing. Meanwhile, their investors

766
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:36,645
Speaker 5:  don't really have patience for them to not be growing their ads business

767
00:47:37,345 --> 00:47:41,045
Speaker 5:  the way they are. So they're still not profitable either. You know,

768
00:47:41,145 --> 00:47:44,565
Speaker 5:  Snap's not made a annual profit ever. So

769
00:47:44,905 --> 00:47:48,685
Speaker 5:  that's if, if they could really like change the way the company runs

770
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:52,845
Speaker 5:  and be leaner and make money and be content with being a

771
00:47:52,845 --> 00:47:56,485
Speaker 5:  smaller business, even though they have a huge user base that's highly engaged,

772
00:47:56,625 --> 00:48:00,285
Speaker 5:  you know, maybe they'll be able to hang in there. They also, I mean they

773
00:48:00,285 --> 00:48:03,205
Speaker 5:  have the benefit, I guess you could call it a benefit or a curse of their

774
00:48:03,205 --> 00:48:07,005
Speaker 5:  founder controlled, you know, like Meta, like Evan Spiegel can't be fired.

775
00:48:07,505 --> 00:48:11,445
Speaker 5:  He controls the company with Bobby Murphy, the co-founder. And that's

776
00:48:11,445 --> 00:48:14,605
Speaker 5:  why stuff like spectacles exists. So yeah, it's a complicated,

777
00:48:15,085 --> 00:48:18,965
Speaker 5:  fascinating company. You know, when I'm out and about, I still see Snap

778
00:48:19,515 --> 00:48:23,045
Speaker 5:  open on phones, you know, like on an airplane I'll still see people using

779
00:48:23,045 --> 00:48:25,965
Speaker 5:  it. It's still very much like in the culture,

780
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:30,445
Speaker 5:  especially like among college students. A thing I've heard is that

781
00:48:31,305 --> 00:48:35,045
Speaker 5:  as the pressure on how kids and teens

782
00:48:35,185 --> 00:48:39,165
Speaker 5:  use these platforms and the a specific, you know, attacks on

783
00:48:39,235 --> 00:48:42,685
Speaker 5:  Snap, the anonymity of it, the ephemerality,

784
00:48:43,415 --> 00:48:47,285
Speaker 5:  which leads to things like drug dealing and like sextortion and like, there's

785
00:48:47,285 --> 00:48:51,005
Speaker 5:  just inherent things in the product that can be really bad, especially for

786
00:48:51,005 --> 00:48:54,965
Speaker 5:  young people with the way it's designed. They're starting to feel that a

787
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:58,805
Speaker 5:  little bit in terms of not only just the regulatory scrutiny, but like the

788
00:48:58,805 --> 00:49:02,485
Speaker 5:  way that people and parents especially think about the product.

789
00:49:02,585 --> 00:49:06,285
Speaker 5:  And I think that could be a huge potential problem for their

790
00:49:06,395 --> 00:49:10,245
Speaker 5:  continued growth, especially with young people. They've got a lot to navigate

791
00:49:10,585 --> 00:49:14,565
Speaker 5:  and they've got Meta and all these other companies also betting

792
00:49:14,565 --> 00:49:18,325
Speaker 5:  and spending way more money on this new hardware platform that they're trying

793
00:49:18,325 --> 00:49:18,725
Speaker 5:  to invent.

794
00:49:19,155 --> 00:49:22,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I mean it seems like even on the messaging side, I mean I give Snap

795
00:49:22,765 --> 00:49:26,725
Speaker 2:  a lot of credit. I think it has been the most innovative

796
00:49:26,725 --> 00:49:30,245
Speaker 2:  messaging app for a very long time. And in terms of like

797
00:49:30,585 --> 00:49:34,005
Speaker 2:  how people talk to each other, It is, It is always been the most interesting

798
00:49:34,005 --> 00:49:37,765
Speaker 2:  one, right? Everything else is, is either stealing features from Snapchat

799
00:49:37,905 --> 00:49:41,685
Speaker 2:  or just less interesting, right? Like we have a million text messaging

800
00:49:41,885 --> 00:49:44,845
Speaker 2:  platforms and nothing else that is even trying to do the thing that Snapchat

801
00:49:44,845 --> 00:49:48,525
Speaker 2:  does really well. But I think you're right, It is, It is such a

802
00:49:48,525 --> 00:49:52,005
Speaker 2:  double-edged sword. This idea that everything goes away is both very sort

803
00:49:52,005 --> 00:49:55,045
Speaker 2:  of compelling in a, in a way right now in that like what we're learning is

804
00:49:55,045 --> 00:49:58,645
Speaker 2:  that more things should go away on the internet, but also it comes with huge

805
00:49:58,885 --> 00:50:02,205
Speaker 2:  downsides. And I think we are reckoning with that in

806
00:50:02,665 --> 00:50:06,645
Speaker 2:  new ways. What is your sense of how big and maybe how

807
00:50:06,645 --> 00:50:10,045
Speaker 2:  desperate a swing ads in chat is?

808
00:50:11,205 --> 00:50:14,925
Speaker 5:  I think it's big. They're, they haven't fully rolled it out to my

809
00:50:14,925 --> 00:50:17,645
Speaker 5:  knowledge, but they are starting to put ads in chat.

810
00:50:19,115 --> 00:50:21,725
Speaker 5:  They just have to, it's just where people spend the most time in the app.

811
00:50:21,725 --> 00:50:25,685
Speaker 5:  It always has been. And it, like I said, It is always driven certain

812
00:50:25,685 --> 00:50:29,325
Speaker 5:  people in the company crazy that they're not able to monetize that engagement,

813
00:50:29,335 --> 00:50:32,845
Speaker 5:  right. And that's why they did stuff like Discover and Spotlight and all

814
00:50:32,845 --> 00:50:36,485
Speaker 5:  these other things and AR is like, maybe we can find a way to monetize through

815
00:50:36,485 --> 00:50:38,805
Speaker 5:  that. So they have to do it. I think

816
00:50:40,235 --> 00:50:43,685
Speaker 5:  they, they, they don't want to tank engagement though at the same time.

817
00:50:44,075 --> 00:50:47,605
Speaker 5:  Like they found that they did with the redesign last year that they're rolling

818
00:50:47,675 --> 00:50:47,965
Speaker 5:  back.

819
00:50:48,425 --> 00:50:52,085
Speaker 2:  It is an interesting test. I mean you think about, we talk a lot about how

820
00:50:52,085 --> 00:50:55,165
Speaker 2:  sticky messaging is and it's one of those things like if you can, if you

821
00:50:55,165 --> 00:50:58,405
Speaker 2:  can build this sort of network of people talking to each other, people will

822
00:50:58,405 --> 00:51:01,605
Speaker 2:  stay on like almost anything else. But I also feel like the minute you put

823
00:51:01,645 --> 00:51:05,485
Speaker 2:  a pre-roll ad on me opening my group chat, I'm

824
00:51:05,485 --> 00:51:08,365
Speaker 2:  out. Right? Like that's, that's, there are very few things that are gonna

825
00:51:08,435 --> 00:51:11,885
Speaker 2:  unstick you like that. And So I think I'm,

826
00:51:12,095 --> 00:51:16,045
Speaker 2:  again, Snapchat is a, a, an app that has really interesting and

827
00:51:16,545 --> 00:51:19,645
Speaker 2:  in many ways ahead of its time design ideas. And So I think this question

828
00:51:19,645 --> 00:51:23,605
Speaker 2:  of like, what, what are ads supposed to look like in chat?

829
00:51:24,475 --> 00:51:28,235
Speaker 2:  I just don't know because I'm like a banner ad in between

830
00:51:28,235 --> 00:51:32,075
Speaker 2:  every four messages again, I'm out. Like, I just, I don't know, I don't

831
00:51:32,305 --> 00:51:36,155
Speaker 2:  even know how to imagine what a successful version of this looks like,

832
00:51:36,155 --> 00:51:39,955
Speaker 2:  but I also understand why at some point Snap and

833
00:51:39,955 --> 00:51:42,115
Speaker 2:  everybody else is gonna have to figure out what it looks like.

834
00:51:42,665 --> 00:51:46,555
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I I think they have to, you know, this conversation has me

835
00:51:46,755 --> 00:51:49,795
Speaker 5:  reminiscing about, you know, 10 years ago, like using Snap with

836
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:53,875
Speaker 5:  my wife, who's my girlfriend at the time, and like how we would just like

837
00:51:53,875 --> 00:51:55,875
Speaker 5:  share things throughout the day with each other in a way that was very like

838
00:51:55,965 --> 00:51:59,915
Speaker 5:  fluid and like goofy and like just a simple photo of something or

839
00:51:59,915 --> 00:52:03,835
Speaker 5:  like, yeah, you felt more connected to people through that visual messaging

840
00:52:03,835 --> 00:52:07,115
Speaker 5:  thing. And there's no product that really has captured that since then.

841
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:07,875
Speaker 2:  No, nothing.

842
00:52:08,495 --> 00:52:12,355
Speaker 5:  And network effects are real. And when you, you know, this happens,

843
00:52:12,475 --> 00:52:14,875
Speaker 5:  I bet a lot of people listening to this can relate. You get older, you leave

844
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:18,755
Speaker 5:  college, you and people are using iMessage instead or they're using WhatsApp

845
00:52:18,775 --> 00:52:22,195
Speaker 5:  or like Signal or, and your network's fracture

846
00:52:22,775 --> 00:52:26,755
Speaker 5:  and SNAP is just not a place where I have

847
00:52:26,755 --> 00:52:30,475
Speaker 5:  my friends anymore. Yeah. And I kind of miss that. Like, I miss, I miss those

848
00:52:30,475 --> 00:52:34,315
Speaker 5:  early days of it where you felt like you could be yourself and you could

849
00:52:34,315 --> 00:52:37,955
Speaker 5:  share just more frequently because it felt casual and

850
00:52:37,955 --> 00:52:41,835
Speaker 5:  depressurized in a way that Instagram definitely does not,

851
00:52:42,215 --> 00:52:46,035
Speaker 5:  or you know, some of these other services and yeah, them

852
00:52:46,265 --> 00:52:50,195
Speaker 5:  putting ads in that experience feels just like it inherently screws it

853
00:52:50,195 --> 00:52:54,075
Speaker 5:  up. So yeah, it's gonna be a, a tricky balance for

854
00:52:54,075 --> 00:52:54,195
Speaker 5:  them.

855
00:52:54,705 --> 00:52:58,435
Speaker 2:  It's, it's a tough one in the way that like, I think one of the reasons you

856
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:02,435
Speaker 2:  do something like Discover is that actually it's really obvious how

857
00:53:02,435 --> 00:53:05,555
Speaker 2:  to do the ads there, right? It's like that's a thing we know how to do and

858
00:53:05,555 --> 00:53:08,955
Speaker 2:  it works and people are used to it and it's you, you can understand why all

859
00:53:08,955 --> 00:53:12,355
Speaker 2:  of that works. And even ads in stories and stuff like that, like that stuff

860
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:16,185
Speaker 2:  feels natural in a way that there just is no version of that

861
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:20,225
Speaker 2:  in in human to human chat that I think is ever gonna

862
00:53:20,225 --> 00:53:23,265
Speaker 2:  feel good to people. To your point about the, the

863
00:53:23,735 --> 00:53:27,645
Speaker 2:  growing the user base outside of kind of the core Snapchat people,

864
00:53:28,265 --> 00:53:31,405
Speaker 2:  what's your sense of how much they even care about that anymore? I mean,

865
00:53:31,405 --> 00:53:35,285
Speaker 2:  like you said, the user base is enormous. I, I am, I don't know a single

866
00:53:35,285 --> 00:53:39,125
Speaker 2:  person my age who uses Snapchat, but maybe it doesn't matter, like maybe

867
00:53:39,145 --> 00:53:40,525
Speaker 2:  I'm old and lame now.

868
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:44,845
Speaker 5:  No, it matters. It matters. If you're running an ADS business it matters

869
00:53:44,845 --> 00:53:47,765
Speaker 5:  because teenagers can't buy a lot of stuff. So

870
00:53:47,875 --> 00:53:49,565
Speaker 2:  Fair. Which has always been a Snapchat problem.

871
00:53:49,795 --> 00:53:53,485
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You really need people in their thirties and forties, fifties even

872
00:53:54,015 --> 00:53:58,005
Speaker 5:  where, where a lot of the growth is happening is outside of the US and

873
00:53:58,005 --> 00:54:01,725
Speaker 5:  even Europe. Their users actually slightly declined in

874
00:54:01,925 --> 00:54:04,845
Speaker 5:  North America last quarter, which is a bad sign.

875
00:54:06,585 --> 00:54:09,965
Speaker 5:  You really have to be strong and growing in North America as one of these

876
00:54:09,965 --> 00:54:13,765
Speaker 5:  social networks that's ad supported for investors to believe in you

877
00:54:13,785 --> 00:54:17,765
Speaker 5:  for your stock price to continue to grow. Which the reason I

878
00:54:17,765 --> 00:54:20,565
Speaker 5:  focus on that is like the stock price is a trickle down of a lot of things

879
00:54:20,565 --> 00:54:23,685
Speaker 5:  that lets you hire better people. It gives you stability to make

880
00:54:24,755 --> 00:54:28,485
Speaker 5:  more strategic long-term decisions that cost you in the short term

881
00:54:28,915 --> 00:54:32,525
Speaker 5:  what we just talked about with the redesign. So it matters. And

882
00:54:33,245 --> 00:54:36,405
Speaker 5:  I think they're struggling to break out of that college team

883
00:54:36,905 --> 00:54:40,405
Speaker 5:  market and they always have. But

884
00:54:41,275 --> 00:54:45,165
Speaker 5:  yeah, I mean maybe the ship has sailed. You know, I've been, when you

885
00:54:45,165 --> 00:54:47,925
Speaker 5:  cover social media long enough, you just realize like network effects are

886
00:54:47,925 --> 00:54:51,565
Speaker 5:  all that matters. Once something tips in one direction, it's really

887
00:54:51,635 --> 00:54:55,245
Speaker 5:  hard, if not impossible to tip it the other way. And once

888
00:54:55,665 --> 00:54:59,405
Speaker 5:  all of your friends have decided that they use other apps to talk to you,

889
00:55:00,025 --> 00:55:03,205
Speaker 5:  how do you get them back on Snap? If I had to guess, there's

890
00:55:03,965 --> 00:55:07,405
Speaker 5:  millions and millions of people just in the US that they

891
00:55:07,735 --> 00:55:11,525
Speaker 5:  would love to, you know, quote unquote resurrect, like bring back to the

892
00:55:11,525 --> 00:55:15,365
Speaker 5:  app. Yeah. And how do you do that? Like what is the, it used to be like

893
00:55:15,615 --> 00:55:19,605
Speaker 5:  viral AR filters, you know, that would turn you into a baby or

894
00:55:19,605 --> 00:55:22,365
Speaker 5:  something like that, right? And now it's like, that's Chad GBT. It's like

895
00:55:22,365 --> 00:55:25,885
Speaker 5:  people doing that with AI and it's like Snap did that eight years ago

896
00:55:26,825 --> 00:55:29,725
Speaker 5:  and it, and it gave them these super viral moments where people came to the

897
00:55:29,725 --> 00:55:33,685
Speaker 5:  app and they just haven't had moments like that anymore. And so the thing

898
00:55:33,685 --> 00:55:37,085
Speaker 5:  that I watch was Snap is like, is the product

899
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:41,085
Speaker 5:  innovation still there? Are they still shipping things regularly that

900
00:55:41,115 --> 00:55:44,885
Speaker 5:  kind of wow the industry and that pace has definitely slowed as they're

901
00:55:44,885 --> 00:55:48,765
Speaker 5:  trying to fix the business. And so, you know, the thing that

902
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:52,245
Speaker 5:  may hurt them is like focusing too much on the business. They have to save

903
00:55:52,385 --> 00:55:55,525
Speaker 5:  in spite of the product that they have to keep relevant.

904
00:55:55,995 --> 00:55:58,885
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. It's, I mean it's kind of a vicious cycle at some point, right?

905
00:55:58,885 --> 00:56:02,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah. You, you can't take the big swings without the money to take the big

906
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:05,325
Speaker 2:  swings, but without big swings you don't get the money to take the big swings.

907
00:56:05,565 --> 00:56:09,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah, we should give them credit for this scale they've hit it's, yeah, it's

908
00:56:09,045 --> 00:56:12,725
Speaker 5:  still is next to impossible. You know, I remember I was in DC when

909
00:56:12,725 --> 00:56:16,205
Speaker 5:  Zuckerberg was on the stand for the meta FTC trial and he was talking about

910
00:56:16,225 --> 00:56:19,965
Speaker 5:  how to his knowledge, no independent company has hit a billion users.

911
00:56:20,155 --> 00:56:22,965
Speaker 5:  They all either get bought by a bigger conglomerate

912
00:56:24,265 --> 00:56:28,205
Speaker 5:  or you know, taken out and Snap is about to hit a billion users.

913
00:56:28,395 --> 00:56:30,565
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And that's a very hard thing to do.

914
00:56:31,125 --> 00:56:33,925
Speaker 2:  I mean that, that's why I'm so interested in this company, right? Like yeah,

915
00:56:34,085 --> 00:56:37,605
Speaker 2:  I cannot stop rooting for Snapchat like sort of against

916
00:56:37,905 --> 00:56:41,725
Speaker 2:  all reality and evidence. I

917
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:45,485
Speaker 2:  think Snapchat is doing a lot of smart good correct

918
00:56:45,545 --> 00:56:49,365
Speaker 2:  things and it's just like the, the fact that it just,

919
00:56:49,425 --> 00:56:53,405
Speaker 2:  if it could solve the ad business that would open up everything

920
00:56:53,405 --> 00:56:57,255
Speaker 2:  else it wants to do is such a frustrating reality to me

921
00:56:57,255 --> 00:57:01,055
Speaker 2:  that It is like what, what this company is not short of is good product

922
00:57:01,125 --> 00:57:04,855
Speaker 2:  that people like, right? Like It is, It is actually over and over able to

923
00:57:04,855 --> 00:57:08,095
Speaker 2:  make good products that people like It just can't make enough money for any

924
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:11,655
Speaker 2:  of that to matter. I mean, and I even think about like the pixie drone

925
00:57:12,075 --> 00:57:16,015
Speaker 2:  was cool. Yeah. And interesting and exciting and there just wasn't, that's

926
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:19,015
Speaker 2:  not the kind of thing you can do when you don't have an ad business, right?

927
00:57:19,015 --> 00:57:21,135
Speaker 2:  It's the kind of thing you can do when you're Mark Zuckerberg and you have

928
00:57:21,135 --> 00:57:24,975
Speaker 2:  just a money fountain coming outta Facebook all the time. Snap just can't,

929
00:57:25,085 --> 00:57:28,895
Speaker 2:  literally can't afford to do that. And it's so frustrating because there

930
00:57:28,895 --> 00:57:32,055
Speaker 2:  is such good product in that company and there always has been

931
00:57:32,675 --> 00:57:36,175
Speaker 2:  and It is just like the reality of being a company in the world has

932
00:57:36,485 --> 00:57:39,615
Speaker 2:  prevented Snapchat from I think being what it actually could have been,

933
00:57:40,355 --> 00:57:43,135
Speaker 5:  Man, RIP Pixie. That one lasted less than a year. I think

934
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:46,895
Speaker 2:  I know one of the cooler videos you've made, I think. Yeah. Going through

935
00:57:46,895 --> 00:57:49,335
Speaker 2:  like a warehouse. Yeah, like an arcade looking thing. That

936
00:57:49,335 --> 00:57:51,695
Speaker 5:  Was good stuff. That was a fun one. Yeah, there's so many things in the last

937
00:57:51,695 --> 00:57:54,895
Speaker 5:  few years that Snap has announced and then killed. Within a year they were

938
00:57:54,895 --> 00:57:58,055
Speaker 5:  gonna do this huge shopping play where they, they were gonna literally put

939
00:57:58,055 --> 00:58:01,575
Speaker 5:  like big vending machines with AR displays on them in

940
00:58:01,635 --> 00:58:04,975
Speaker 5:  stores. I, I remember doing this at their event a couple years ago

941
00:58:05,555 --> 00:58:09,095
Speaker 5:  and it was gonna like let their ads be more targeted. They were gonna hook

942
00:58:09,095 --> 00:58:13,055
Speaker 5:  into all these retailers and do ar try-on stuff and like reduce

943
00:58:13,075 --> 00:58:16,695
Speaker 5:  the amount of trade-ins that stores need to do with physical goods. Like

944
00:58:16,695 --> 00:58:20,615
Speaker 5:  you could just wear the stuff on you really cool, innovative, kind of weird

945
00:58:20,745 --> 00:58:24,695
Speaker 5:  wacky idea. Killed it within a year because they had to focus on

946
00:58:24,695 --> 00:58:28,655
Speaker 5:  getting the business turned around, right? And that back and

947
00:58:28,655 --> 00:58:31,255
Speaker 5:  forth that we've been talking about where they try a thing and then they

948
00:58:31,495 --> 00:58:34,415
Speaker 5:  realized they can't do it either because it doesn't work or it's hurting

949
00:58:34,415 --> 00:58:37,655
Speaker 5:  the business. They gotta focus on the business has just been a pattern for

950
00:58:37,655 --> 00:58:41,615
Speaker 5:  the last like five years and are for them to really

951
00:58:42,735 --> 00:58:45,905
Speaker 5:  come through this, they've gotta get outta that cycle. And I'm not sure how

952
00:58:45,905 --> 00:58:46,185
Speaker 5:  they do,

953
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:49,665
Speaker 2:  Should Evan have just taken the 6 billion from Mark Zuckerberg all those

954
00:58:49,665 --> 00:58:49,985
Speaker 2:  years ago?

955
00:58:50,665 --> 00:58:54,625
Speaker 5:  I don't know. I mean if it was mostly Facebook stock, which I

956
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:58,585
Speaker 5:  think a good healthy chunk of it was, yeah, everyone at Snap

957
00:58:58,585 --> 00:59:00,625
Speaker 5:  would be a lot richer right now. Yeah, that's true.

958
00:59:01,495 --> 00:59:04,745
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I mean 10 years ago everyone should have taken the deal if it included

959
00:59:05,105 --> 00:59:05,225
Speaker 2:  Facebook

960
00:59:05,225 --> 00:59:09,105
Speaker 5:  Stock Snap has had so many offers, you know Google Yeah. Many

961
00:59:09,105 --> 00:59:12,705
Speaker 5:  times Facebook again before they went public, other

962
00:59:12,985 --> 00:59:16,265
Speaker 5:  companies and other parts of the world. It's a very valuable asset. Like

963
00:59:16,265 --> 00:59:20,065
Speaker 5:  I said, there's very few scaled social networks to get to a billion users

964
00:59:20,175 --> 00:59:24,005
Speaker 5:  that have this kind of engagement. It's just can this

965
00:59:24,005 --> 00:59:27,405
Speaker 5:  team that's running it make it a huge business?

966
00:59:27,865 --> 00:59:30,445
Speaker 5:  And so far the answer is no.

967
00:59:30,695 --> 00:59:34,085
Speaker 2:  Right? It does make you wonder, I mean again, back to the like, can you make

968
00:59:34,125 --> 00:59:38,005
Speaker 2:  a messaging business a business? You, you wonder at some

969
00:59:38,005 --> 00:59:41,405
Speaker 2:  point if this is just a like structural mismatch if like the thing that is

970
00:59:41,405 --> 00:59:44,485
Speaker 2:  great about Snapchat is never going to be its business.

971
00:59:45,225 --> 00:59:49,085
Speaker 2:  And that is a really hard problem to solve because it then

972
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:52,765
Speaker 2:  means you have to go do another thing really well. Yeah. And very few

973
00:59:53,005 --> 00:59:54,525
Speaker 2:  companies have actually successfully done that.

974
00:59:55,315 --> 00:59:58,925
Speaker 5:  Yeah, we'll see, I mean, spectacles is the bet. That's like the big bet

975
00:59:58,925 --> 01:00:02,725
Speaker 5:  outside of Snapchat. It's gonna take a long time. And I feel like I was

976
01:00:02,725 --> 01:00:06,645
Speaker 5:  saying that 10 years ago, so this has been like the story of air

977
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:07,285
Speaker 5:  glasses is

978
01:01:58,055 --> 01:02:00,955
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Let's do a question from The Vergecast hotline. As

979
01:02:00,955 --> 01:02:04,795
Speaker 2:  always, you can call 8 6 6 VERGE one one. You can email Vergecast at The

980
01:02:04,875 --> 01:02:08,835
Speaker 2:  Verge dot com. Send us all of your thoughts and feelings and questions about

981
01:02:08,835 --> 01:02:12,635
Speaker 2:  everything. Recently, it seems a lot of you have questions about places you've

982
01:02:12,635 --> 01:02:16,475
Speaker 2:  found ants, which I find extremely delightful. But also you continue to have

983
01:02:16,635 --> 01:02:20,565
Speaker 2:  questions about the Google trial and in particular for now, let

984
01:02:20,565 --> 01:02:23,765
Speaker 2:  me just play you one of the questions I've actually gotten a few versions

985
01:02:23,765 --> 01:02:26,645
Speaker 2:  of over the last couple of weeks and see if I can answer it here. It's,

986
01:02:28,235 --> 01:02:31,495
Speaker 6:  Hey David, my name is Rag and I had a thought about

987
01:02:32,035 --> 01:02:34,855
Speaker 6:  the code rolling and the ongoing

988
01:02:35,495 --> 01:02:39,295
Speaker 6:  remedies trial for Google and Google Chrome and the talk about

989
01:02:39,295 --> 01:02:42,855
Speaker 6:  splitting it off into or like having it sold to a separate company.

990
01:02:43,395 --> 01:02:47,175
Speaker 6:  But I haven't seen in any of the discussions so far folks

991
01:02:47,535 --> 01:02:51,495
Speaker 6:  considering that why won't Google just turn down the project

992
01:02:51,775 --> 01:02:55,615
Speaker 6:  altogether? Why would they have to consider selling it? Like sure they could

993
01:02:55,805 --> 01:02:59,775
Speaker 6:  make some billions of dollars by selling it,

994
01:03:00,555 --> 01:03:03,975
Speaker 6:  but they probably stand to lose more, especially if they're selling it to

995
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:08,015
Speaker 6:  OpenAI. The value gain that OpenAI can have over the

996
01:03:08,015 --> 01:03:10,815
Speaker 6:  long term and like the immediate market share that they would have, the six,

997
01:03:10,915 --> 01:03:14,855
Speaker 6:  the whatever browser market share that Chrome has. It seems

998
01:03:14,855 --> 01:03:18,365
Speaker 6:  like unless this number is extremely high,

999
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:22,405
Speaker 6:  which I'm sure the DOJ will not let it be, then

1000
01:03:23,185 --> 01:03:26,765
Speaker 6:  why Google should even consider selling it and instead just be like, well,

1001
01:03:26,885 --> 01:03:30,205
Speaker 6:  chromium can go open source, we will not contribute to it anymore

1002
01:03:30,825 --> 01:03:34,725
Speaker 6:  and Chrome as a project will just turn it down and we'll,

1003
01:03:34,985 --> 01:03:38,045
Speaker 6:  you know, consider some open source project as like the default browser and

1004
01:03:38,045 --> 01:03:41,605
Speaker 6:  Android going forward. Yeah, I'm just curious about your thoughts and

1005
01:03:42,265 --> 01:03:46,165
Speaker 6:  why do you think that this is a bad idea or a good idea? And if Google

1006
01:03:46,165 --> 01:03:48,805
Speaker 6:  should or Google will actually consider doing this. Thank you.

1007
01:03:49,845 --> 01:03:53,535
Speaker 2:  Okay, So I think the thing about this question is

1008
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:58,325
Speaker 2:  it speaks to all of what's happening in this trial in a way that I actually

1009
01:03:58,325 --> 01:04:00,725
Speaker 2:  find really fascinating. I, I asked a bunch of people this question like

1010
01:04:00,725 --> 01:04:04,605
Speaker 2:  isn't the better idea if you want to take away Google's dominance to just

1011
01:04:04,605 --> 01:04:08,285
Speaker 2:  shut Chrome down altogether, right? Just remove the project open, source

1012
01:04:08,285 --> 01:04:12,125
Speaker 2:  it something, right? Like just take it away from Google, it doesn't

1013
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:15,765
Speaker 2:  matter who gets it. You don't even necessarily want to sort of King make

1014
01:04:15,765 --> 01:04:19,605
Speaker 2:  some other company just make Google, get rid of something, push

1015
01:04:19,625 --> 01:04:23,605
Speaker 2:  the project away, make it nobody's. I think what I've

1016
01:04:23,605 --> 01:04:27,365
Speaker 2:  come to realize is that's actually not the goal from the DOJ

1017
01:04:27,385 --> 01:04:30,885
Speaker 2:  in this case. So if you look at it there, there's sort of two things going

1018
01:04:30,885 --> 01:04:34,605
Speaker 2:  on, right? What they wanna do is they wanna undo some of Google's

1019
01:04:34,605 --> 01:04:38,485
Speaker 2:  dominance. You have this company that has built this whole system by

1020
01:04:38,485 --> 01:04:41,685
Speaker 2:  which it remains the biggest and most important thing in search, has all

1021
01:04:41,685 --> 01:04:45,245
Speaker 2:  the market share, and you wanna sort of systematically stop that from

1022
01:04:45,245 --> 01:04:49,045
Speaker 2:  happening, right? But the way that the DOJ

1023
01:04:49,065 --> 01:04:53,045
Speaker 2:  frames it, it's not just enough to sort of level the playing field

1024
01:04:53,325 --> 01:04:57,125
Speaker 2:  starting now, if you say, okay, beginning today,

1025
01:04:57,985 --> 01:05:01,165
Speaker 2:  may of 2025 or whenever this trial actually ends,

1026
01:05:01,785 --> 01:05:05,685
Speaker 2:  we are all playing by the same rules. Google has

1027
01:05:05,685 --> 01:05:09,565
Speaker 2:  this gigantic, essentially insurmountable lead. And even if you take away

1028
01:05:09,585 --> 01:05:13,285
Speaker 2:  Chrome, all you're doing is taking Google's lead and

1029
01:05:13,665 --> 01:05:16,925
Speaker 2:  moving it around, right? Like what the DOJ wants

1030
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:21,445
Speaker 2:  is to engineer a fairer fight. And that means not

1031
01:05:21,475 --> 01:05:25,365
Speaker 2:  just slowing Google down but actually speeding others up.

1032
01:05:25,865 --> 01:05:28,565
Speaker 2:  And this is one of the things about this trial that I have found really complicated.

1033
01:05:28,745 --> 01:05:32,325
Speaker 2:  So if you take something like Chrome and you say, okay, what we need is we,

1034
01:05:32,325 --> 01:05:35,925
Speaker 2:  we wanna give this to somebody in order to make them a viable

1035
01:05:35,935 --> 01:05:39,605
Speaker 2:  competitor. This is what Google is facing with a lot of its search stuff,

1036
01:05:39,605 --> 01:05:43,445
Speaker 2:  by the way, the do j's big plan to essentially white label Google search

1037
01:05:43,505 --> 01:05:47,405
Speaker 2:  and force Google to give away all of the data and all

1038
01:05:47,405 --> 01:05:51,045
Speaker 2:  of the search results and all of the query information that it gets from

1039
01:05:51,045 --> 01:05:54,165
Speaker 2:  its search engine in order to let others make better search engines.

1040
01:05:54,915 --> 01:05:58,845
Speaker 2:  It's the same idea here, right? It's not just you can't do X,

1041
01:05:58,965 --> 01:06:02,645
Speaker 2:  Y, and Z anymore. It's you Google have to do the work to bring a

1042
01:06:02,645 --> 01:06:06,605
Speaker 2:  competitor or several competitors or hundreds of competitors up to your level.

1043
01:06:06,665 --> 01:06:10,565
Speaker 2:  That's what the DOJ wants. And when it comes to Chrome, you have this thing

1044
01:06:11,075 --> 01:06:14,805
Speaker 2:  that could just be put into an open

1045
01:06:14,805 --> 01:06:18,365
Speaker 2:  source world and everybody could maintain it. But I have to say

1046
01:06:18,445 --> 01:06:22,045
Speaker 2:  Google's argument has been that actually building a browser is hugely

1047
01:06:22,045 --> 01:06:25,965
Speaker 2:  expensive and hugely complicated. And Chrome is only as good as It is because

1048
01:06:25,965 --> 01:06:29,845
Speaker 2:  Google has been the only company willing to invest this much time

1049
01:06:29,845 --> 01:06:33,565
Speaker 2:  and this many resources into it. I find that very compelling and I think

1050
01:06:33,945 --> 01:06:37,805
Speaker 2:  the judge does too. And so the idea that you would just

1051
01:06:37,875 --> 01:06:40,925
Speaker 2:  release it to everybody and Chrome would continue to be great, I think is

1052
01:06:40,925 --> 01:06:44,685
Speaker 2:  just wrong. And so you end up in a position where you're saying, okay,

1053
01:06:44,975 --> 01:06:48,925
Speaker 2:  we're either going to kill Chrome entirely for everybody,

1054
01:06:48,975 --> 01:06:52,765
Speaker 2:  which I don't think is actually plausible or even maybe possible

1055
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:56,765
Speaker 2:  given what Chrome is and where It is, you'd essentially just like blow

1056
01:06:56,785 --> 01:07:00,725
Speaker 2:  up half of people's devices. Nobody I think wants that. So

1057
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:04,645
Speaker 2:  then you have to say, we have to put this in someone's hands who

1058
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:08,445
Speaker 2:  also has the resources and incentives and finances to take care of this.

1059
01:07:09,335 --> 01:07:13,125
Speaker 2:  There aren't that many companies that can do that. There are a bunch of companies

1060
01:07:13,125 --> 01:07:17,005
Speaker 2:  out there that would very much like to buy Chrome. Perplexity has said

1061
01:07:17,005 --> 01:07:20,925
Speaker 2:  it once, it, Yahoo said it once, it open AI said it once it, I mean

1062
01:07:20,925 --> 01:07:23,485
Speaker 2:  anybody with the resources would happily buy Chrome. It's one of the most

1063
01:07:23,485 --> 01:07:27,285
Speaker 2:  popular and important things on the internet. I've heard from a lot of companies

1064
01:07:27,285 --> 01:07:31,045
Speaker 2:  who are like, you don't understand having this kind of browser data is

1065
01:07:31,425 --> 01:07:35,325
Speaker 2:  hugely important to almost any business on the internet. If I know what

1066
01:07:35,325 --> 01:07:38,885
Speaker 2:  4 billion people are doing online, I can figure out how to make money off

1067
01:07:38,885 --> 01:07:41,525
Speaker 2:  of that. It's just that it's gonna be really expensive to buy Chrome. So

1068
01:07:41,525 --> 01:07:45,005
Speaker 2:  there aren't that many companies that can actually afford the thing. And

1069
01:07:45,055 --> 01:07:49,005
Speaker 2:  doing that is going to be challenging. So the

1070
01:07:49,005 --> 01:07:52,565
Speaker 2:  flip side though is that whoever does get it immediately becomes

1071
01:07:52,965 --> 01:07:56,445
Speaker 2:  enormously powerful, right? It, it's like if you just let someone buy

1072
01:07:56,475 --> 01:08:00,285
Speaker 2:  Instagram, hugely powerful because now you own Instagram. It's not,

1073
01:08:00,805 --> 01:08:03,565
Speaker 2:  it's not like you're, you're bringing somebody up. You've given somebody

1074
01:08:03,565 --> 01:08:06,805
Speaker 2:  the most powerful version of this product

1075
01:08:07,465 --> 01:08:11,285
Speaker 2:  on the market. And so far it seems like the company that makes the most

1076
01:08:11,285 --> 01:08:15,245
Speaker 2:  sense would be OpenAI. It has the resources, it has the ability

1077
01:08:15,385 --> 01:08:18,925
Speaker 2:  to raise infinite money in order to be able to do stuff like this. It has

1078
01:08:19,365 --> 01:08:23,325
Speaker 2:  a real incentive to have a browser, to have all this data to be able to put

1079
01:08:23,325 --> 01:08:26,965
Speaker 2:  chat two PT more directly in front of you all the time. It is the one

1080
01:08:26,995 --> 01:08:30,965
Speaker 2:  closest to the same set of incentives and resources that Google has. But

1081
01:08:30,995 --> 01:08:34,925
Speaker 2:  then if you give open AI Chrome or even let

1082
01:08:34,925 --> 01:08:37,805
Speaker 2:  open AI buy Chrome, I think all the money is sort of immaterial. It's just

1083
01:08:37,805 --> 01:08:38,005
Speaker 2:  money.

1084
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:43,395
Speaker 2:  Now, open AI is vastly powerful and It is in a position of

1085
01:08:44,105 --> 01:08:48,035
Speaker 2:  huge authority over a lot of what we do online too. And the question I

1086
01:08:48,035 --> 01:08:51,995
Speaker 2:  think in front of the judge in this case is, is it better

1087
01:08:52,015 --> 01:08:55,715
Speaker 2:  to have two sort of giant

1088
01:08:55,905 --> 01:08:59,835
Speaker 2:  superpowers of the web than one? And the problem is that

1089
01:08:59,835 --> 01:09:03,755
Speaker 2:  we've had one, and it's been Google, but does two solve the problem

1090
01:09:04,095 --> 01:09:07,915
Speaker 2:  is, is Google and AI enough competition that it's

1091
01:09:07,915 --> 01:09:10,675
Speaker 2:  okay that we have two companies that are, you know, a thousand miles ahead

1092
01:09:10,835 --> 01:09:14,195
Speaker 2:  of everybody else in the race? Or is the goal to have

1093
01:09:14,495 --> 01:09:17,995
Speaker 2:  dozens, hundreds, thousands of other companies that can do the kind of stuff

1094
01:09:18,265 --> 01:09:21,915
Speaker 2:  that these companies are doing too. And if that's the goal,

1095
01:09:22,435 --> 01:09:26,115
Speaker 2:  I don't think you can allow Google to sell Chrome to open ai.

1096
01:09:26,555 --> 01:09:30,395
Speaker 2:  I don't even know who you have to allow Google to sell Chrome two,

1097
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:34,475
Speaker 2:  if what you're trying to do is raise a whole industry chromium, the,

1098
01:09:34,475 --> 01:09:38,235
Speaker 2:  the open source browser stack underneath a lot of this is very

1099
01:09:38,235 --> 01:09:41,195
Speaker 2:  important and is one of the things that lets a lot of people roll other browsers.

1100
01:09:41,855 --> 01:09:45,395
Speaker 2:  But Chrome won like in, in every meaningful way Chrome won the browser

1101
01:09:45,585 --> 01:09:49,475
Speaker 2:  wars and everybody else is just kind of nibbling around the edges. So the

1102
01:09:49,635 --> 01:09:53,555
Speaker 2:  question in front of the court in this particular case is, do we want to

1103
01:09:53,625 --> 01:09:57,595
Speaker 2:  King make one other company in order to make them

1104
01:09:57,655 --> 01:10:00,915
Speaker 2:  as powerful as Google, or at least close to it in the way that the internet

1105
01:10:00,915 --> 01:10:04,895
Speaker 2:  works? And is that competition, like, does that count? Did we do

1106
01:10:04,895 --> 01:10:08,295
Speaker 2:  the job or is there some other remedy that we're gonna have to figure out

1107
01:10:08,295 --> 01:10:12,265
Speaker 2:  here? And I think that's why the DOJ is pursuing this

1108
01:10:12,265 --> 01:10:16,225
Speaker 2:  idea of both kind of making Google White label all of

1109
01:10:16,225 --> 01:10:20,105
Speaker 2:  its search stuff such that any other search engine can get it, but also

1110
01:10:20,105 --> 01:10:23,305
Speaker 2:  take away Chrome and give it to somebody else. And So I think where we might

1111
01:10:23,375 --> 01:10:27,065
Speaker 2:  land is instead of one giant, we have two, whether it's OpenAI or somebody

1112
01:10:27,065 --> 01:10:30,225
Speaker 2:  else. And then the hope is if you can also have

1113
01:10:31,205 --> 01:10:34,825
Speaker 2:  dozens or hundreds or whatever of other Google quality

1114
01:10:34,885 --> 01:10:38,865
Speaker 2:  search engines, that that market becomes the solvable

1115
01:10:38,865 --> 01:10:42,425
Speaker 2:  thing. I don't know if that's the right answer, but I do think that's why

1116
01:10:43,205 --> 01:10:47,105
Speaker 2:  Google isn't going to be allowed to just get rid of Chrome.

1117
01:10:47,545 --> 01:10:50,065
Speaker 2:  There are a bunch of business reasons Google wouldn't do it, right? Like,

1118
01:10:50,645 --> 01:10:54,585
Speaker 2:  it, it, it makes a certain kind of like logical sense to say Google

1119
01:10:54,585 --> 01:10:58,545
Speaker 2:  would rather just shut the whole thing down. But if you offer the company

1120
01:10:58,925 --> 01:11:02,145
Speaker 2:  the chance to have, you know, tens of billions of dollars or nothing,

1121
01:11:02,575 --> 01:11:04,905
Speaker 2:  they're pretty much always gonna choose the tens of billions of dollars.

1122
01:11:05,605 --> 01:11:09,345
Speaker 2:  And Google wants Chrome. Google wants

1123
01:11:09,345 --> 01:11:12,465
Speaker 2:  this thing to continue to work, so It is going to hold onto it for dear life.

1124
01:11:12,465 --> 01:11:15,525
Speaker 2:  And I think the idea that it would just sort of voluntarily shut it down,

1125
01:11:17,065 --> 01:11:20,605
Speaker 2:  it, it makes a certain kind of abstract sense, but I don't think it's realistic

1126
01:11:20,665 --> 01:11:23,885
Speaker 2:  for Google. And it's also not what the DOJ wants because if it goes away,

1127
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:27,895
Speaker 2:  all it does is make Google the same kind of powerful, but in sort

1128
01:11:27,895 --> 01:11:30,495
Speaker 2:  of a different direction. I hope that makes sense. I think it's a really

1129
01:11:30,695 --> 01:11:34,255
Speaker 2:  interesting question and there's a lot of this left to litigate. There's

1130
01:11:34,255 --> 01:11:37,895
Speaker 2:  a lot of decisions for Judge Meta left to make about what competition looks

1131
01:11:37,895 --> 01:11:41,655
Speaker 2:  like and what it means to bring Google down versus bring others up

1132
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:44,895
Speaker 2:  and what sort of middle point there

1133
01:11:45,595 --> 01:11:49,495
Speaker 2:  counts as success. There's a bunch left of this trial. We have closing arguments,

1134
01:11:49,495 --> 01:11:53,415
Speaker 2:  we have the, the decision. We're months away. There's gonna be appeals.

1135
01:11:53,485 --> 01:11:56,135
Speaker 2:  It's, it's gonna be a while before we start this out, but I think we're,

1136
01:11:56,225 --> 01:11:59,815
Speaker 2:  we're starting to see what it might look like and I find it totally fascinating.

1137
01:12:01,835 --> 01:12:04,375
Speaker 2:  All right, that is it for the first cast today. Thank you to everybody who

1138
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:07,495
Speaker 2:  came on the show and thank you as always for listening. Like I mentioned,

1139
01:12:07,555 --> 01:12:07,775
Speaker 2:  if
