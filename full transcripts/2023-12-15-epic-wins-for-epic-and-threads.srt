Description: The Verge's Nilay Patel, David Pierce, and Alex Cranz discuss Apple responding to Beeper's iMessage for Android and the various other text-based platform news from this week.

2
00:01:20,035 --> 00:01:23,345
Speaker 4:  Hello and Welcome To The Vergecast, America's number one source of cyber

3
00:01:23,505 --> 00:01:26,705
Speaker 4:  sruck wiper news. Breaking news on The Vergecast. Today, the cyber sruck

4
00:01:26,715 --> 00:01:30,305
Speaker 4:  wiper is one blade. It will cost $79 to replace and the entire assembly,

5
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:33,825
Speaker 4:  I believe will cost 169 4 20.

6
00:01:34,745 --> 00:01:35,945
Speaker 4:  I actually dunno the second one.

7
00:01:37,095 --> 00:01:37,825
Speaker 5:  That sounds right though.

8
00:01:37,905 --> 00:01:38,905
Speaker 1:  I fully believe that.

9
00:01:39,385 --> 00:01:40,705
Speaker 5:  I was like, yeah, that's, that sounds like

10
00:01:40,985 --> 00:01:43,225
Speaker 1:  Accurate. Oh God, what have we become?

11
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:48,145
Speaker 4:  I'm, I'm your friend. Neli. That's David. Pierce having an existential crisis.

12
00:01:49,095 --> 00:01:49,945
Speaker 4:  Alex Cranz is here.

13
00:01:50,385 --> 00:01:53,065
Speaker 5:  I I'm your friend that also believes that's the right price. That sounds

14
00:01:53,065 --> 00:01:53,265
Speaker 5:  right.

15
00:01:53,585 --> 00:01:56,985
Speaker 4:  I don't think you can price something at 420 cents. I don't think. I just

16
00:01:56,985 --> 00:01:58,305
Speaker 4:  wanna, there's a tell in there.

17
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:02,865
Speaker 5:  You can you just like, you put an asterisk next to it.

18
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:04,945
Speaker 4:  All. right. Two things about the cyber track wiper. Before we begin the show,

19
00:02:04,945 --> 00:02:08,385
Speaker 4:  there's a lot to talk about. There's a huge week for low stakes apple drama.

20
00:02:08,585 --> 00:02:08,905
Speaker 4:  I will say

21
00:02:10,415 --> 00:02:14,265
Speaker 4:  Threads officially launched ActivityPub support in minor ways. You can,

22
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:18,385
Speaker 4:  we should talk about that. That's a big deal. And then big news of

23
00:02:18,445 --> 00:02:22,025
Speaker 4:  the week. Maybe the year, maybe the century. Google lost

24
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:26,385
Speaker 4:  the antitrust case with Epic. Epic won the antitrust case against

25
00:02:26,385 --> 00:02:29,385
Speaker 4:  Google. Sean. Hollister was in the courtroom every day. He interviewed Tim

26
00:02:29,455 --> 00:02:32,105
Speaker 4:  Sweeney at the end of it. He's gonna join the show. We're gonna talk all

27
00:02:32,105 --> 00:02:34,145
Speaker 4:  about what happened there and what it means. And then of course we don't

28
00:02:34,145 --> 00:02:37,905
Speaker 4:  have a lightning round. But let's begin with the cyber truck wiper, which

29
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:38,665
Speaker 4:  is why that's good. Do

30
00:02:38,665 --> 00:02:39,785
Speaker 1:  The most important news at the top.

31
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,585
Speaker 4:  That's good. Which is why the people are here.

32
00:02:43,565 --> 00:02:47,345
Speaker 4:  So many, many, many people sent me Jason ESSA's

33
00:02:47,755 --> 00:02:51,505
Speaker 4:  video of the truck on launch day. I think I've mentioned ha

34
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,785
Speaker 4:  on the channel before. This is like a great YouTube channel. Jason's really

35
00:02:53,785 --> 00:02:57,065
Speaker 4:  good. That video is very controversial. 'cause it is fawning, it is just

36
00:02:57,105 --> 00:03:00,725
Speaker 4:  a fawning look at the cyber truck and you can, whatever.

37
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:04,205
Speaker 4:  You can have whatever feelings about that and, and in that video, in that

38
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:07,925
Speaker 4:  moment, sure. In that video he

39
00:03:08,015 --> 00:03:11,975
Speaker 4:  waves around a cyber truck wiper on his lap. It shows

40
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:15,215
Speaker 4:  that it's one blade, but it's all fly. It's like I just didn't wanna, I couldn't

41
00:03:15,215 --> 00:03:16,895
Speaker 4:  engage with it. You know what I mean? Did you

42
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:20,775
Speaker 6:  Just almost say the phrase floppy blade and decide to

43
00:03:20,775 --> 00:03:21,615
Speaker 6:  run away from that?

44
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:25,455
Speaker 4:  Just do you see where, do you see where I'm at with it?

45
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:26,335
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

46
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:29,735
Speaker 4:  I do. So the evidence that it was one single blade was there

47
00:03:30,475 --> 00:03:33,815
Speaker 4:  at the launch day when the videos from Marquez and Jason came out and, and

48
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:37,775
Speaker 4:  I think MotorTrend had one too. I just couldn't, I couldn't be

49
00:03:37,775 --> 00:03:41,135
Speaker 4:  like, this is what solved the mystery. I just, I in my heart, do you know,

50
00:03:41,135 --> 00:03:42,415
Speaker 4:  do, do you know? Do you know what I mean? A

51
00:03:42,415 --> 00:03:45,935
Speaker 5:  Floppy blade can't solve a mystery. I, I understand. Yes, I understand.

52
00:03:45,945 --> 00:03:48,015
Speaker 6:  After all this work, it's just a floppy blade.

53
00:03:48,715 --> 00:03:52,175
Speaker 4:  So then this week and you know, people are sending it to me and I app, I

54
00:03:52,175 --> 00:03:56,055
Speaker 4:  appreciate all of the cyber truck wiper detectives out there this week. The

55
00:03:56,055 --> 00:03:59,855
Speaker 4:  parts manual for the cyber truck went online. Yeah. What's interesting about

56
00:03:59,855 --> 00:04:03,415
Speaker 4:  it is some people can see prices in it and we cannot,

57
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:07,975
Speaker 4:  oh, so Umar Shaki and her staff has a Tesla model three logged in with his

58
00:04:07,975 --> 00:04:10,815
Speaker 4:  account, can't see the prices on Twitter. People are going through it and

59
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:14,575
Speaker 4:  they can see the prices. Hmm. There's a discrepancy there. We're digging

60
00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:18,055
Speaker 4:  into why. Well, if you know why, please email us at first cast@theriggers.com.

61
00:04:18,795 --> 00:04:22,775
Speaker 4:  But in there, cyber shop wiper single blade seven $9, which

62
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:26,895
Speaker 4:  in the grand scheme of luxury vehicle wiper

63
00:04:26,895 --> 00:04:30,375
Speaker 4:  blades is not that high. But I would just ask you to look into your heart,

64
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:35,855
Speaker 4:  imagine a triangle and decide if you think the cyber truck wiper

65
00:04:35,855 --> 00:04:39,715
Speaker 4:  should cost as much as like A-B-M-W-M three wiper.

66
00:04:40,175 --> 00:04:43,075
Speaker 4:  You just tell me don don't know the answer to that question.

67
00:04:43,715 --> 00:04:47,475
Speaker 5:  I mean A BMW. Yes, it should. Wow. Same kind of person.

68
00:04:48,805 --> 00:04:52,635
Speaker 4:  Rough. And that's very fast. Everybody. That's Alex Cranz. It's Alex.

69
00:04:52,655 --> 00:04:53,915
Speaker 4:  Do Cranz The Verge dot com.

70
00:04:55,615 --> 00:04:59,515
Speaker 5:  You all read Idiots and cars on Reddit. You

71
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:00,995
Speaker 5:  know what I'm saying?

72
00:05:01,305 --> 00:05:04,355
Speaker 4:  Yeah. How much does the turn signal stock cost though, to be All? right.

73
00:05:05,315 --> 00:05:08,915
Speaker 4:  I do read it. Anyway, that's the cyber truck wiper news, we believe based

74
00:05:08,915 --> 00:05:12,155
Speaker 4:  on the available evidence. And it is a single floppy blade.

75
00:05:13,765 --> 00:05:17,665
Speaker 4:  don don't know man. I just, I, you watch the video, there's a video of marque

76
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:20,225
Speaker 4:  driving it through the rain and his video's really good, but you should watch

77
00:05:20,345 --> 00:05:22,825
Speaker 4:  'em all. It's fine. even that Jason one's really fun though. The production

78
00:05:22,825 --> 00:05:23,625
Speaker 4:  value is very high.

79
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:29,005
Speaker 4:  He's, he's wiping and you can see it bending. Is it

80
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:32,785
Speaker 4:  wipes? And then you're like, if anything, if there's something

81
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:36,745
Speaker 4:  other than rain, for example, snow or ice

82
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:41,295
Speaker 4:  is the thing just gonna bend at the halfway point? don

83
00:05:41,295 --> 00:05:44,175
Speaker 4:  don't know man. I don don't know. It's like a scoop. This, I don't wanna

84
00:05:44,175 --> 00:05:46,335
Speaker 4:  review this truck at all. I understand there's four wheel steering under

85
00:05:46,335 --> 00:05:49,735
Speaker 4:  it and it's 48 vol. I understand it's steer by wire. There's

86
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:53,055
Speaker 4:  technology. You can hit it with a hammer. Whatever you want. I just

87
00:05:54,045 --> 00:05:57,605
Speaker 4:  want to use the wiper and if anybody can hook Alexis Hanian,

88
00:05:57,985 --> 00:06:01,845
Speaker 4:  I'm talking to you bud. One, can I meet your wife two,

89
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:03,685
Speaker 4:  can I, can I try your cyber trucks? Right.

90
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:07,725
Speaker 6:  This is once again getting into Eli's forever vision

91
00:06:07,745 --> 00:06:11,605
Speaker 6:  of reviewing cars without ever going anywhere in them. Like Neli just

92
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:15,165
Speaker 6:  wants to sit inside of a car that is not going anywhere and review it that

93
00:06:15,365 --> 00:06:15,485
Speaker 6:  way.

94
00:06:15,915 --> 00:06:19,725
Speaker 4:  Just push, push all the buttons sequentially. It will be great. All, right?

95
00:06:19,725 --> 00:06:23,045
Speaker 4:  That's the cyber truck update for this week. Once again, The Verge is your

96
00:06:23,045 --> 00:06:26,645
Speaker 4:  number one source of Cybert truck wiper news. And it's all thanks to listeners

97
00:06:26,645 --> 00:06:29,615
Speaker 4:  like you Vergecast at The Verge dot com. All, right?

98
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:34,375
Speaker 4:  Big week for low stakes Twitter drama or yeah, big week for low stakes Apple

99
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:38,015
Speaker 4:  drama. Although I think if you're on Apple's security team,

100
00:06:38,225 --> 00:06:41,535
Speaker 4:  maybe this isn't so low stakes for you, David, tell the people what is going

101
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:43,175
Speaker 4:  on with Beeper Mini and iMessage.

102
00:06:43,565 --> 00:06:47,175
Speaker 6:  Okay, so last week you guys

103
00:06:47,285 --> 00:06:50,975
Speaker 6:  were on the pod talking about this new app, Beeper Mini that came out from

104
00:06:50,975 --> 00:06:53,255
Speaker 6:  this company Beeper, that if you listen to Vergecast, you've heard us talk

105
00:06:53,255 --> 00:06:56,375
Speaker 6:  about a few times. It's like a universal messaging app. And they had come

106
00:06:56,375 --> 00:07:00,055
Speaker 6:  out with a new app called BER Mini for Android that made you

107
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:04,255
Speaker 6:  completely, seamlessly a blue bubble on iOS.

108
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:08,815
Speaker 6:  Big Deal meant you could send native iMessages to iPhone users, it would

109
00:07:08,815 --> 00:07:11,855
Speaker 6:  fix your group chats. Like huge win. Everybody got very excited.

110
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:13,215
Speaker 6:  Apple

111
00:07:14,785 --> 00:07:18,485
Speaker 6:  didn't say anything when it came out. Has not really said anything over months

112
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:22,445
Speaker 6:  about these apps in general. Like beeper's been kind of making noise about

113
00:07:22,445 --> 00:07:26,045
Speaker 6:  how it's hacking iMessage for a while. text.com is a thing that exists Sunbird

114
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:29,285
Speaker 6:  and nothing did that weird thing not that long ago. Apple really hasn't said

115
00:07:29,645 --> 00:07:33,285
Speaker 6:  anything and I and others on our team have been pestering Apple for weeks

116
00:07:33,465 --> 00:07:37,285
Speaker 6:  to say something about this like this it, if Apple is the

117
00:07:37,645 --> 00:07:40,925
Speaker 6:  security focused company, it believes it is, it should have something to

118
00:07:40,925 --> 00:07:44,685
Speaker 6:  say about whether these are a good idea or not. We didn't hear anything for

119
00:07:44,685 --> 00:07:46,045
Speaker 6:  a long time. And then last

120
00:07:47,865 --> 00:07:51,685
Speaker 6:  Friday, right after you guys published The Vergecast, because

121
00:07:51,685 --> 00:07:55,485
Speaker 6:  the news is a fun and fickle thing, it started to become clear that

122
00:07:55,485 --> 00:07:58,965
Speaker 6:  Beeper Mini was not working anymore. People couldn't send messages. And

123
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:03,165
Speaker 6:  the ongoing assumption was that Apple had found a way to shut it down. The

124
00:08:03,165 --> 00:08:06,965
Speaker 6:  Beeper team starts like furiously try to fix it. Eric Midkowski, the

125
00:08:06,965 --> 00:08:10,925
Speaker 6:  founder, is talking to pe everyone he can find who will listen to

126
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:14,125
Speaker 6:  him about why Apple should not shut this down, why it's good for the world,

127
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:18,205
Speaker 6:  why it's making things more secure, even for iPhone users. On and on and

128
00:08:18,205 --> 00:08:21,805
Speaker 6:  on on Saturday as I'm sitting in the

129
00:08:22,145 --> 00:08:26,005
Speaker 6:  HyperX eSports arena in Las Vegas waiting for the World

130
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:29,085
Speaker 6:  Excel championships, which is a thing I'm sure we will talk more about in

131
00:08:29,085 --> 00:08:29,325
Speaker 6:  the future.

132
00:08:30,965 --> 00:08:34,485
Speaker 6:  I get a, I get a note from Apple saying finally we have something to say.

133
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:38,565
Speaker 6:  And basically what Apple did was confirm that they took steps to shut

134
00:08:38,565 --> 00:08:42,325
Speaker 6:  down Bieber Mini and kind of without saying in exactly those

135
00:08:42,325 --> 00:08:45,565
Speaker 6:  words said they intend to keep doing so. And

136
00:08:46,115 --> 00:08:49,485
Speaker 6:  that has sparked this whole fight where Beeper then spent the next few days

137
00:08:49,485 --> 00:08:53,365
Speaker 6:  trying to get back up and running. Apple seems to have kind of taken

138
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:56,885
Speaker 6:  steps to shut it down again after it got up and running. Beeper got a version

139
00:08:56,885 --> 00:09:00,125
Speaker 6:  of it that was still functional but less impressive where you still had to

140
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,885
Speaker 6:  use an Apple ID and you were only messaging from your email, not your phone

141
00:09:02,885 --> 00:09:06,085
Speaker 6:  number. So it's kind of a half measure. And basically we're now in this like

142
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:10,325
Speaker 6:  cat and mouse game where Beeper is both like on principle and

143
00:09:10,345 --> 00:09:14,245
Speaker 6:  for the sake of its product, deeply committed to the idea of getting

144
00:09:14,285 --> 00:09:17,645
Speaker 6:  iMessage working. And Apple has made very clear that it is not going to allow

145
00:09:17,645 --> 00:09:21,485
Speaker 6:  that to happen. And it's perfectly possible that

146
00:09:21,485 --> 00:09:24,085
Speaker 6:  things will change eight more times between when I'm saying this and when

147
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:27,845
Speaker 6:  you hear this podcast. But as of right now, that's where we stand, like two

148
00:09:27,845 --> 00:09:31,645
Speaker 6:  sides fundamentally at odds. And neither one really has even

149
00:09:31,965 --> 00:09:33,525
Speaker 6:  a move to back down at this point.

150
00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:37,085
Speaker 4:  Lemme just read this statement from Apple 'cause I think it's fascinating.

151
00:09:37,085 --> 00:09:40,645
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And again, this was sent to David while he was at the Excel World

152
00:09:40,645 --> 00:09:44,325
Speaker 4:  Championships and he messaged me at what I believe was 9:00 PM

153
00:09:44,425 --> 00:09:48,365
Speaker 4:  on a Friday night saying, can you edit this? I'm at, I'm in Las Vegas.

154
00:09:49,995 --> 00:09:51,485
Speaker 4:  Just an incredible message. Teresa

155
00:09:53,105 --> 00:09:56,725
Speaker 4:  All. right? Here's the whole statement from from Apple. At Apple we build

156
00:09:56,725 --> 00:09:59,925
Speaker 4:  our products and services with industry leading privacy and security technologies

157
00:10:00,205 --> 00:10:02,885
Speaker 4:  designed to give users control of their data and keep personal information

158
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:06,405
Speaker 4:  safe. We took steps to protect our users by blocking

159
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:10,125
Speaker 4:  techniques that exploit fake credentials in order to gain access to

160
00:10:10,165 --> 00:10:13,965
Speaker 4:  iMessage. These techniques post significant risk to user security and

161
00:10:13,965 --> 00:10:17,805
Speaker 4:  privacy, including the potential for metadata exposure and enabling

162
00:10:17,845 --> 00:10:21,565
Speaker 4:  unwanted messages, spam and phishing attacks. We will continue

163
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:25,805
Speaker 4:  to make updates in the future to protect our user. So this

164
00:10:25,905 --> 00:10:29,285
Speaker 4:  is a really interesting statement to me. One,

165
00:10:29,825 --> 00:10:30,445
Speaker 4:  it exists.

166
00:10:32,345 --> 00:10:35,485
Speaker 4:  That's, that's something, it's not nothing, right? Yeah.

167
00:10:36,185 --> 00:10:39,205
Speaker 6:  We, people should know this is worth saying out loud. I'm sure we have said

168
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:43,125
Speaker 6:  this in the past, but like we ask Apple to comment on things that

169
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,965
Speaker 6:  happen in and around the Apple world all the time. And

170
00:10:47,185 --> 00:10:49,885
Speaker 6:  the vast majority of the time we get absolutely nothing.

171
00:10:50,765 --> 00:10:54,485
Speaker 6:  Occasionally we will get a, like we decline a comment and then you get that

172
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:57,085
Speaker 6:  like canned statement that Apple says every once in a while when they acquire

173
00:10:57,165 --> 00:10:59,445
Speaker 6:  a company that's just like Apple acquires companies from time to time and

174
00:10:59,445 --> 00:11:03,325
Speaker 6:  just not generally a comment on the murder of acquisitions. So yeah,

175
00:11:03,325 --> 00:11:07,285
Speaker 6:  the very existence of a multiple sentence comment from Apple

176
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:08,925
Speaker 6:  is unbelievably

177
00:11:08,925 --> 00:11:12,005
Speaker 4:  Unusual. Yeah. So that's just one thing. Like the amount the, the amount

178
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,565
Speaker 4:  of pure signal from this statement existing is very high. Yeah. Apple felt

179
00:11:15,565 --> 00:11:18,965
Speaker 4:  like it needed to shut this down. It felt like it needed to explain why.

180
00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:22,965
Speaker 4:  And you know, you, everyone knows about our background rules. We said put

181
00:11:23,005 --> 00:11:24,845
Speaker 4:  a name on it and they put a name on it. Great.

182
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:29,845
Speaker 4:  Then it explains how they blocked it,

183
00:11:30,335 --> 00:11:33,965
Speaker 4:  which is super interesting, right? There's a level of technical

184
00:11:33,965 --> 00:11:37,885
Speaker 4:  detail in here. They block techniques that exploit fake credentials

185
00:11:37,885 --> 00:11:41,565
Speaker 4:  in order to gain access to iMessage. I'll come back to that. Then it

186
00:11:41,565 --> 00:11:45,405
Speaker 4:  explains why Beeper is dangerous in Apple's view.

187
00:11:46,555 --> 00:11:50,365
Speaker 4:  They, they don't have to do that, right? There's something in there

188
00:11:50,365 --> 00:11:54,165
Speaker 4:  where Apple felt like they have to say there are risks to security

189
00:11:54,185 --> 00:11:57,805
Speaker 4:  and privacy and what those risks are. Metadata,

190
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:01,645
Speaker 4:  metadata exposure, enabling unwanted messages, spam and phishing attacks.

191
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:06,695
Speaker 4:  This is vastly more information than anyone actually needs.

192
00:12:06,755 --> 00:12:09,695
Speaker 4:  Or that honestly that Apple is like these are their servers.

193
00:12:11,155 --> 00:12:14,935
Speaker 4:  You can feel however you want to, but one

194
00:12:14,965 --> 00:12:18,775
Speaker 4:  totally legitimate avenue for Apple to

195
00:12:18,775 --> 00:12:21,855
Speaker 4:  take here is to say, we locked down access to our servers or our servers

196
00:12:21,855 --> 00:12:25,735
Speaker 4:  go away. And Apple has done things like that

197
00:12:26,095 --> 00:12:29,935
Speaker 4:  a million times. Yeah. Like we're having this conversation in

198
00:12:29,935 --> 00:12:33,735
Speaker 4:  the context of Epic v Google, which was preceded by Epic v

199
00:12:33,735 --> 00:12:37,255
Speaker 4:  Apple, you'll recall Apple responded to Epic

200
00:12:38,085 --> 00:12:42,015
Speaker 4:  launching a in-app billing system on iOS by shutting

201
00:12:42,015 --> 00:12:44,895
Speaker 4:  down access to Unreal Engine. Yep.

202
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:47,255
Speaker 5:  Like,

203
00:12:48,325 --> 00:12:51,935
Speaker 4:  Like this is not a company that acts lightly when it acts. So. I wanna talk

204
00:12:51,935 --> 00:12:55,335
Speaker 4:  about the why just really quickly and, and then I wanna go back to the how

205
00:12:55,335 --> 00:12:58,215
Speaker 4:  because and how is important, especially with how Beeper vs is getting around

206
00:12:58,215 --> 00:13:01,775
Speaker 4:  it. Now, the why here, I think they have to say why,

207
00:13:02,165 --> 00:13:05,895
Speaker 4:  because there was demand for Beeper Mini.

208
00:13:05,895 --> 00:13:09,455
Speaker 4:  There were people lots and lots and lots and lots of people were

209
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:13,335
Speaker 4:  excited about it. They want this product. So for Apple

210
00:13:13,475 --> 00:13:17,055
Speaker 4:  to take it away from them, they had to provide some reasons

211
00:13:17,835 --> 00:13:21,415
Speaker 4:  for why it, why it's being disallowed, why an

212
00:13:21,415 --> 00:13:25,255
Speaker 4:  experience is being broken that people liked and people wanted. And

213
00:13:25,255 --> 00:13:29,055
Speaker 4:  those reasons have to be good. And in general, when it comes

214
00:13:29,055 --> 00:13:32,655
Speaker 4:  to large company ACE and their servers, the thing they turn to is security.

215
00:13:33,235 --> 00:13:36,895
Speaker 4:  Yep. And the security argument might be valid. I'm just saying in general

216
00:13:37,005 --> 00:13:39,975
Speaker 4:  when they're like, what's a morally unimpeachable reason for doing whatever

217
00:13:39,975 --> 00:13:43,775
Speaker 4:  we want? The answer is always security and So don

218
00:13:43,775 --> 00:13:46,815
Speaker 4:  don't know what the actual potential for metadata exposure is.

219
00:13:47,595 --> 00:13:50,975
Speaker 4:  That's a weird one. Especially 'cause Apple right now is in a bit of a crisis

220
00:13:51,605 --> 00:13:55,015
Speaker 4:  over the cops just asking for push notification data and getting it

221
00:13:55,285 --> 00:13:59,135
Speaker 4:  without warrants. Yep. That's a, that's a real problem in iOS apple's plugging

222
00:13:59,135 --> 00:14:02,575
Speaker 4:  that hole, changing some policy. But that was a real problem. Like if you're

223
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:06,415
Speaker 4:  worried about metadata exposure, there's, there are bigger fish to fry,

224
00:14:07,155 --> 00:14:10,375
Speaker 4:  but it, this is really interesting, right? They're, they're laying out metadata

225
00:14:10,655 --> 00:14:14,095
Speaker 4:  exposure, which is basically the cops asking for metadata from

226
00:14:14,535 --> 00:14:17,375
Speaker 4:  companies that don't have the resources to fight back like Beeper and then

227
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,935
Speaker 4:  all this enabling on launch itself. So that's the why and you can,

228
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:24,415
Speaker 4:  you can evaluate the why on your own. But I, big companies often turn to

229
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:27,615
Speaker 4:  security. Apple turn to security. Then there's the how

230
00:14:29,305 --> 00:14:32,365
Speaker 4:  we blocked techniques that exploit fake credentials. So Beeper was coming

231
00:14:32,365 --> 00:14:34,285
Speaker 4:  up with what fake serial numbers of Apple.

232
00:14:34,285 --> 00:14:37,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah. They were using like serial, they were spoofing serial numbers that

233
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:40,405
Speaker 5:  already existed for, for like Mac products Apple.

234
00:14:40,825 --> 00:14:44,205
Speaker 4:  And this is the thing that enabled them to just register any phone number

235
00:14:44,275 --> 00:14:47,605
Speaker 4:  time message. Right? Right. You did not need an Apple id.

236
00:14:48,145 --> 00:14:52,005
Speaker 4:  So now you do need an Apple id and it's tied to an email address and

237
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,765
Speaker 4:  I truly wonder if there is still a fake credential

238
00:14:56,705 --> 00:15:00,085
Speaker 4:  or an old serial number in the mix and whether Apple will be able to stop

239
00:15:00,085 --> 00:15:00,205
Speaker 4:  it.

240
00:15:00,315 --> 00:15:01,685
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's hard to know. 'cause I think

241
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:06,485
Speaker 6:  Eric and the Buer team have gotten maybe not surprisingly

242
00:15:07,195 --> 00:15:10,845
Speaker 6:  less open about how all of this works. They were very

243
00:15:10,845 --> 00:15:14,765
Speaker 6:  confident 10 days ago they put out a whole big like white paper

244
00:15:14,765 --> 00:15:17,645
Speaker 6:  about how the tech worked. A lot of it was open source. They're like, this

245
00:15:17,645 --> 00:15:21,565
Speaker 6:  is what we did and how we did it. And the assumption was we're only,

246
00:15:21,565 --> 00:15:23,805
Speaker 6:  they're only being dishonest because there's nothing Apple can do about it.

247
00:15:23,805 --> 00:15:27,205
Speaker 6:  Right. So that was like the line going around was if Apple wanted to stop

248
00:15:27,205 --> 00:15:30,885
Speaker 6:  this, it would have to shut down a huge portion of iMessage. Turns out not

249
00:15:30,885 --> 00:15:34,685
Speaker 6:  the case. So Beeper has definitely like locked down

250
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:38,645
Speaker 6:  some of its explanation, but what it used to do in the early days of

251
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:42,525
Speaker 6:  Beeper was just sign you into your Apple ID on a Mac mini in

252
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:46,365
Speaker 6:  a server rack somewhere that is in

253
00:15:46,365 --> 00:15:50,005
Speaker 6:  every way you can think about it. Insecure. Right? Right. Like it meant,

254
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:53,685
Speaker 6:  it meant your messages and your Apple ID information was sitting on a computer

255
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:57,605
Speaker 6:  that you did not own, like straightforward insecurity. What Bieber says now

256
00:15:57,985 --> 00:16:01,525
Speaker 6:  is that it's, it's figured out kind of a good middle ground how to take some

257
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:05,205
Speaker 6:  of that on device encryption and added security

258
00:16:05,785 --> 00:16:09,525
Speaker 6:  in Bieber Mini and applied it back to, to

259
00:16:09,525 --> 00:16:12,845
Speaker 6:  some extent the old way of doing things. It's not on a Mac mini anymore,

260
00:16:12,845 --> 00:16:16,405
Speaker 6:  it's still in your device, but they're going it seems like through the same

261
00:16:16,745 --> 00:16:19,845
Speaker 6:  old login through your Apple ID stuff as they used to. So they found kind

262
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:23,725
Speaker 6:  of a a half measure that seems to solve some problems, but

263
00:16:23,845 --> 00:16:27,125
Speaker 6:  it, it screws up the main thing, which is it no longer works with your phone

264
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:30,845
Speaker 6:  number. Like Eric has been texting me this week from his Gmail account, which

265
00:16:30,845 --> 00:16:34,765
Speaker 6:  is not the same as your phone number. It's just not. And so Bieber Mini

266
00:16:34,825 --> 00:16:38,685
Speaker 6:  is like kind of a, a knee capped version of what it once was,

267
00:16:38,785 --> 00:16:42,725
Speaker 6:  but it does seem to have at least if you believe Bieber and

268
00:16:42,725 --> 00:16:46,605
Speaker 6:  that is kind of the open question. Is it, it it is

269
00:16:47,155 --> 00:16:51,005
Speaker 6:  back in a lot of the right security practices here, which is good.

270
00:16:51,355 --> 00:16:55,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah. The one thing that I think is fascinating about this entire ordeal

271
00:16:55,165 --> 00:16:58,125
Speaker 4:  and then we should just move on because this is just gonna be a cat mask

272
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:02,045
Speaker 4:  game for a long time. Beeper is very confident in their technical solution.

273
00:17:02,745 --> 00:17:06,175
Speaker 4:  Right? And that turned out to not to be the case. And now they're very confident

274
00:17:06,175 --> 00:17:08,575
Speaker 4:  in this technical solution and maybe they'll get back to phone numbers and

275
00:17:08,855 --> 00:17:12,415
Speaker 4:  whatever that is. The technical side of this, can Apple

276
00:17:12,595 --> 00:17:16,435
Speaker 4:  defeat this exploit Maybe? it can Maybe, it can't Maybe, it will be cat mass

277
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:20,315
Speaker 4:  forever. It feels like it'll be Cat forever. There's a

278
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:24,535
Speaker 4:  gigantic legal problem here, right? Like Beeper users and I

279
00:17:24,535 --> 00:17:28,145
Speaker 4:  just accessing Apple servers without permission and

280
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,945
Speaker 4:  Apple has lawyers. I don't know if anybody

281
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:32,025
Speaker 6:  Aware. It's like a lot

282
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:35,985
Speaker 4:  Of stuff. There's there's quite a few of them. Yeah. They are not shy. And

283
00:17:36,665 --> 00:17:40,505
Speaker 4:  I think that this is probably, that's probably the last resort here again,

284
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:44,105
Speaker 4:  just the presence of this statement indicates to me

285
00:17:44,975 --> 00:17:48,785
Speaker 4:  that Apple knows it has to explain its behavior in blocking this on a

286
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:52,765
Speaker 4:  technical level. If they can't do that and they have to

287
00:17:52,765 --> 00:17:55,925
Speaker 4:  resort to a legal level or a contractual level,

288
00:17:56,625 --> 00:18:00,415
Speaker 4:  right? To say, okay, if you use on Unreal Engine, if you are

289
00:18:00,415 --> 00:18:03,855
Speaker 4:  using, if you're using our servers in an unapproved way,

290
00:18:04,065 --> 00:18:06,535
Speaker 4:  we're just gonna turn off your Apple IDs.

291
00:18:07,675 --> 00:18:10,615
Speaker 4:  You're done, you're out. That's just a contractual thing they can do. You

292
00:18:10,615 --> 00:18:14,135
Speaker 4:  broke our terms of service, you're done. No more, no more access to your

293
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:17,975
Speaker 4:  photos. They could do it. Right. Other platforms do

294
00:18:17,975 --> 00:18:18,775
Speaker 4:  stuff like that all the time.

295
00:18:20,455 --> 00:18:23,395
Speaker 4:  Do do you want them to like I they don don't think they want to do that to

296
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:27,235
Speaker 4:  people. If they go ahead and sue Beeper for a violation of the

297
00:18:27,395 --> 00:18:30,475
Speaker 4:  Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which is a very controversial statute. Like

298
00:18:30,475 --> 00:18:34,315
Speaker 4:  that's not like a, a cut and dry. You're morally correct when you

299
00:18:34,315 --> 00:18:38,155
Speaker 4:  invoke the CFAA do, do you wanna have that fight? Do you wanna

300
00:18:38,155 --> 00:18:41,435
Speaker 4:  go to court again? I I can send Sean to that courtroom too.

301
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:45,995
Speaker 4:  We, story streams are great. You know, I, I just think Apple would prefer

302
00:18:45,995 --> 00:18:48,955
Speaker 4:  to defeat this on a technical level and I think people would prefer to fight

303
00:18:48,955 --> 00:18:52,875
Speaker 4:  this on a technical level. There is a whole set of other levels that

304
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:56,315
Speaker 4:  is vastly more complicated that Apple has not touched yet. And I'm actually

305
00:18:56,315 --> 00:18:59,635
Speaker 4:  kind of shocked they haven't even sent the letter to re yet. That's like

306
00:18:59,635 --> 00:18:59,995
Speaker 4:  stop it.

307
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:01,155
Speaker 5:  I mean they

308
00:19:01,345 --> 00:19:02,475
Speaker 4:  Like that to me is they

309
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,235
Speaker 5:  Could have, they just haven't told us.

310
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,435
Speaker 4:  I think, I think Eric would happily publish that letter.

311
00:19:07,585 --> 00:19:10,675
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I agree with that. That would be out there. Well I think on the one

312
00:19:10,675 --> 00:19:14,475
Speaker 6:  hand, I think the reason Apple hasn't done that

313
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:18,235
Speaker 6:  yet is the thing that Beeper is holding onto, which is that

314
00:19:18,975 --> 00:19:22,675
Speaker 6:  people want Beeper. Like I think it, if you just abstract all of this away

315
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:26,315
Speaker 6:  and it's like, okay, what should the world look like? Beeper's, right? Right.

316
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:30,075
Speaker 6:  Like the Yep. I want to live in a world where Beeper Mini exists. It is

317
00:19:30,075 --> 00:19:33,675
Speaker 6:  better interoperable messaging is better. Cross-platform messaging is better.

318
00:19:34,175 --> 00:19:37,235
Speaker 6:  The whole green bubble, blue bubble thing is stupid and we should do whatever

319
00:19:37,235 --> 00:19:39,995
Speaker 6:  it takes to get rid of it. I believe all of those things. I also believe

320
00:19:39,995 --> 00:19:43,515
Speaker 6:  Apple is absolutely within its right to shut it all down. Right? Like both

321
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,275
Speaker 6:  of those things are true. I think Apple

322
00:19:47,775 --> 00:19:51,475
Speaker 6:  has started to pick a public fight here

323
00:19:51,705 --> 00:19:55,635
Speaker 6:  that Beeper can make very ugly for it if it wants to. And Apple

324
00:19:56,185 --> 00:19:59,755
Speaker 6:  will fight those fights if it comes to it. It will, it will pick a privacy

325
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:03,795
Speaker 6:  fight in the court of public opinion or in literal court when it comes

326
00:20:03,795 --> 00:20:07,675
Speaker 6:  to it. But that's a pretty big battle. And

327
00:20:08,145 --> 00:20:10,915
Speaker 6:  Eric and Bieber have proven they're willing to be very loud about this and

328
00:20:10,915 --> 00:20:14,195
Speaker 6:  they're willing to be very principled in their argument for an open internet.

329
00:20:14,495 --> 00:20:18,235
Speaker 6:  And that's just a hard fight to fight if you're Apple without looking like

330
00:20:18,235 --> 00:20:18,635
Speaker 6:  the bad guy.

331
00:20:18,715 --> 00:20:20,395
Speaker 5:  Well they have an obligation. Yeah.

332
00:20:20,795 --> 00:20:23,595
Speaker 6:  'cause they kind of are the bad guy. They're allowed to be the bad guy. They're

333
00:20:23,595 --> 00:20:27,555
Speaker 6:  well within their right to be the bad guy, but they will look like the bad

334
00:20:27,555 --> 00:20:28,875
Speaker 6:  guy if they pick this. But the

335
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:32,755
Speaker 5:  Apple kind of has to pick it a little bit, right? Because it does have the

336
00:20:32,755 --> 00:20:35,955
Speaker 5:  regulators in the eu it has regulators looking in the United States and one

337
00:20:35,955 --> 00:20:39,195
Speaker 5:  of its big defenses for all of its really like kind of

338
00:20:39,855 --> 00:20:43,715
Speaker 5:  bad practices is that it's security, security, security. So

339
00:20:43,715 --> 00:20:47,685
Speaker 5:  anytime there is like these security moments, they they have to do it. Otherwise

340
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:50,885
Speaker 5:  that argument falls apart in all those other places. Right?

341
00:20:51,055 --> 00:20:52,645
Speaker 6:  Right. But I think the, the more

342
00:20:54,325 --> 00:20:57,765
Speaker 6:  aggressively and loudly Apple right

343
00:20:58,055 --> 00:20:59,365
Speaker 6:  picks a fight with Beeper,

344
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:04,765
Speaker 6:  the worse it's gonna look doing so. Right. 'cause it's one thing to say we're

345
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:07,845
Speaker 6:  doing something to protect our users. It's another thing to say we are out

346
00:21:07,845 --> 00:21:11,005
Speaker 6:  to destroy this startup full of people who just wanna make messaging better.

347
00:21:11,435 --> 00:21:15,165
Speaker 5:  Well it's very similar to Jailbreaking where like

348
00:21:15,195 --> 00:21:18,125
Speaker 5:  they, they weren't necessarily always going out and, and sending letters

349
00:21:18,185 --> 00:21:21,965
Speaker 5:  to jail breakers. They were usually closing those holes quietly and then

350
00:21:21,965 --> 00:21:25,725
Speaker 5:  people would get upset and then they would just slowly start taking

351
00:21:25,825 --> 00:21:29,765
Speaker 5:  all of the good stuff from jailbreaking and put it into to Apple to the point

352
00:21:29,765 --> 00:21:33,445
Speaker 5:  where like nobody really jailbreak phones as often anymore because you don't

353
00:21:33,445 --> 00:21:37,005
Speaker 5:  have to like all, you don't get anything of real value for the

354
00:21:37,565 --> 00:21:40,125
Speaker 5:  majority of people. And it feels like it's kind of the same thing here where

355
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:44,085
Speaker 5:  they can just like keep making like the, if the solution for Beeper

356
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:47,765
Speaker 5:  becomes like unwieldy enough, then Beeper goes away because

357
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:51,605
Speaker 5:  nobody wants to just be sending texts via their, their email and,

358
00:21:51,785 --> 00:21:55,685
Speaker 5:  and Apple wins and kinda that similar jailbreak way of just like, well if

359
00:21:55,685 --> 00:21:59,125
Speaker 5:  the other, if the option's crummy enough, do you really wanna do it? And

360
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:03,005
Speaker 5:  most Apple users are like, nah, I'll just go to Android. Totally.

361
00:22:03,065 --> 00:22:06,605
Speaker 6:  And we're kind of headed down that road now, right? Like even the, the Beeper

362
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:10,205
Speaker 6:  team has been tweeting as this has all gone back and forth. Like, we understand

363
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:13,725
Speaker 6:  this is a pain, we're we're, we get it. If you wanna bail while we try to

364
00:22:13,725 --> 00:22:16,085
Speaker 6:  figure this out, like we will figure this out. Like they're clearly feeling

365
00:22:16,985 --> 00:22:20,925
Speaker 6:  the hit of how complicated Apple is making their lives. Yeah. But at

366
00:22:20,925 --> 00:22:24,365
Speaker 6:  the same time Elizabeth Warren is out here tweeting about

367
00:22:24,585 --> 00:22:28,565
Speaker 6:  Beeper and what is happening to green bubbles

368
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:30,285
Speaker 6:  and blue bubbles, which is like, it's

369
00:22:30,405 --> 00:22:30,725
Speaker 5:  Hysterical.

370
00:22:31,075 --> 00:22:34,845
Speaker 6:  This, this might be a fight coming for Apple

371
00:22:35,025 --> 00:22:39,005
Speaker 6:  in a way that it doesn't want and is probably not likely to try and

372
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:42,285
Speaker 6:  look like the heavy on more than it has to don don't know. I don't think

373
00:22:42,285 --> 00:22:45,685
Speaker 6:  this is anywhere near over. Yeah. I my guess would be Beeper Mini never gets

374
00:22:45,685 --> 00:22:49,605
Speaker 6:  back to being what it was. But this fight gets louder and uglier

375
00:22:49,605 --> 00:22:52,525
Speaker 6:  in other directions and I have no idea where it lands.

376
00:22:52,835 --> 00:22:53,805
Speaker 5:  That feels right. Yeah.

377
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:55,605
Speaker 4:  I I get the feeling that Apple

378
00:22:57,225 --> 00:23:00,285
Speaker 4:  is gonna just end up leaning on RCS support to solve all these problems.

379
00:23:00,285 --> 00:23:03,485
Speaker 4:  Right. This is why they're doing it. They, they basically made this horse

380
00:23:03,485 --> 00:23:06,405
Speaker 4:  trade with European regulators. We're gonna support RCS and you're not gonna

381
00:23:06,405 --> 00:23:09,925
Speaker 4:  make us open up iMessage in exactly the way that Beeper is trying to open

382
00:23:09,925 --> 00:23:13,565
Speaker 4:  up iMessage. Right. And eventually they will kill Beeper. It just seems like

383
00:23:14,305 --> 00:23:17,085
Speaker 4:  the question is whether they can do it on a technical level or whether they

384
00:23:17,085 --> 00:23:20,765
Speaker 4:  have to resort to the more aggressive legal level. I I

385
00:23:21,325 --> 00:23:25,045
Speaker 4:  I think the fact that they already c conceded the RRCs

386
00:23:25,205 --> 00:23:29,025
Speaker 4:  question means that they're not gonna hesitate to

387
00:23:29,025 --> 00:23:32,225
Speaker 4:  kill it. They're gonna maybe hesitate and how fast they kill it

388
00:23:33,065 --> 00:23:36,965
Speaker 4:  and hope and probably assume that they will do it on a technical

389
00:23:36,965 --> 00:23:40,365
Speaker 4:  level with what feels like an unimpeachable security

390
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:43,965
Speaker 4:  rationale rather than a legal level and what feels like a,

391
00:23:45,385 --> 00:23:49,325
Speaker 4:  you know, much less fun business rationale. Yeah. This thing preserves our

392
00:23:49,325 --> 00:23:52,805
Speaker 4:  lock-in, right? That's the answer. Yeah. Like we have the emails from Eddie

393
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:56,725
Speaker 4:  Q to Phil Schiller where Eddie Q is like, we should open up iMessage to Android

394
00:23:56,825 --> 00:23:58,925
Speaker 4:  and Phil Schiller's, I believe it was Phil Schiller,

395
00:24:00,865 --> 00:24:04,205
Speaker 4:  it was filler. Craig writes back, this is the thing that

396
00:24:04,435 --> 00:24:08,045
Speaker 4:  parents hand down their iPhones to their kids for. Yep. So

397
00:24:08,225 --> 00:24:11,405
Speaker 4:  no, and that's just as dead on as it gets.

398
00:24:12,105 --> 00:24:15,965
Speaker 4:  And I, a lawsuit based on that seems way less fun than a bunch

399
00:24:15,965 --> 00:24:18,325
Speaker 4:  of engineers fighting Alex by the way, to your point about jail breaking

400
00:24:19,245 --> 00:24:22,725
Speaker 4:  a huge number of members of the jail, a huge number of the

401
00:24:22,725 --> 00:24:26,685
Speaker 4:  jailbreak community was Apple engineers. Oh really? And I think there's

402
00:24:26,685 --> 00:24:29,165
Speaker 4:  a, I think, I think there, I think Apple knew this.

403
00:24:31,855 --> 00:24:35,795
Speaker 4:  There there was, there was a lot of, yeah there are some, there

404
00:24:35,795 --> 00:24:38,595
Speaker 4:  are some stories in the end as you guys, but we'll set those aside.

405
00:24:39,495 --> 00:24:43,115
Speaker 4:  That's what I'll say. I don't remember how off the record stories are.

406
00:24:43,655 --> 00:24:46,155
Speaker 4:  That's what I'm trying to tell you. That's fair. I think that's good enough.

407
00:24:46,155 --> 00:24:49,155
Speaker 4:  They're so long ago that I don't remember if they were secrets or not, but

408
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:52,755
Speaker 4:  it is true just on its face. You go back and dig through it.

409
00:24:53,555 --> 00:24:57,035
Speaker 4:  A substantial amount of the Joeb Break community was reliant on Apple Engineers,

410
00:24:57,045 --> 00:25:00,915
Speaker 4:  which is fascinating. So Beeper that's, that's your answer. Yeah.

411
00:25:00,915 --> 00:25:04,635
Speaker 4:  Jailbreak. The iPhone. That's your answer All. right. Let's talk about

412
00:25:04,645 --> 00:25:08,155
Speaker 4:  other messaging news which is much more exciting but also about

413
00:25:08,155 --> 00:25:12,075
Speaker 4:  interoperability, which is ActivityPub had a big moment

414
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:14,875
Speaker 4:  today. Yeah. Masks on had a big moment today. Threads had a big moment today.

415
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:15,555
Speaker 4:  Today. But what's going on there?

416
00:25:16,135 --> 00:25:20,035
Speaker 6:  So the biggest thing that, well two big things happened to

417
00:25:20,035 --> 00:25:23,835
Speaker 6:  Threads this week. One is that it's now available in the eu. So

418
00:25:23,835 --> 00:25:27,315
Speaker 6:  to everyone who has gotten a bunch of new followers putting

419
00:25:27,655 --> 00:25:30,955
Speaker 6:  u's where there should just be os that's why there's tons of those people.

420
00:25:31,255 --> 00:25:35,195
Speaker 6:  And the other thing is Mark Zuckerberg kind of out of nowhere posted

421
00:25:35,495 --> 00:25:38,715
Speaker 6:  on Threads, that Threads is now starting to

422
00:25:38,945 --> 00:25:42,155
Speaker 6:  integrate with ActivityPub in a very small way. Basically

423
00:25:42,735 --> 00:25:46,435
Speaker 6:  you can now read Threads posts from a couple of

424
00:25:46,435 --> 00:25:49,075
Speaker 6:  accounts. It's like Adam Mosseri and a couple of other Meta people right

425
00:25:49,075 --> 00:25:52,395
Speaker 6:  now. But ultimately it'll be everybody who's on Threads. You can read their

426
00:25:52,525 --> 00:25:55,315
Speaker 6:  posts on Mastodon or in any other

427
00:25:56,115 --> 00:26:00,035
Speaker 6:  ActivityPub app like that. So this is, this is the first real step

428
00:26:00,615 --> 00:26:03,955
Speaker 6:  in Federating Threads with the rest of the

429
00:26:04,275 --> 00:26:07,875
Speaker 6:  ActivityPub universe. And for months there's been this debate, is Threads

430
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:10,275
Speaker 6:  ever gonna do this? Now that they see it's such a big potential business

431
00:26:10,275 --> 00:26:14,155
Speaker 6:  and it's so successful, maybe they'll walk away and they have said over and

432
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:17,595
Speaker 6:  over and over like no, we plan to do this for real. And it appears that work

433
00:26:17,595 --> 00:26:21,115
Speaker 6:  is like very seriously underway. People are starting to see Adam

434
00:26:21,465 --> 00:26:25,355
Speaker 6:  ER's Threads posts in their Mastodon clients, which is kind of mind bending

435
00:26:25,355 --> 00:26:27,875
Speaker 6:  in the coolest way. Yeah. Like it's happening. It's the best.

436
00:26:28,025 --> 00:26:31,795
Speaker 4:  Yeah. He's at Macary at thread sut net. I signed, I followed him from my

437
00:26:31,795 --> 00:26:35,715
Speaker 4:  Mastodon social account using the Mammoth app and then I opened my regular

438
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:38,355
Speaker 4:  MAs on client and looked at my account and it was there and I was like, oh

439
00:26:38,355 --> 00:26:39,035
Speaker 4:  this is the future.

440
00:26:39,215 --> 00:26:40,555
Speaker 6:  Yep. That's it. That's the stuff

441
00:26:41,025 --> 00:26:44,725
Speaker 4:  Like I, I'm using multiple clients to access one account and

442
00:26:45,155 --> 00:26:48,605
Speaker 4:  content from another server entirely that is owned by Meta showing up here

443
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:51,085
Speaker 4:  and including a video. Right. He, the first thing he posted was a video.

444
00:26:51,155 --> 00:26:54,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And then a bunch of other Threads folks, including their

445
00:26:54,845 --> 00:26:58,365
Speaker 4:  engineers are, are posting like little jokes like it went from 4 0 4 to 200

446
00:26:59,505 --> 00:27:02,845
Speaker 4:  and you can tell they're just like playing with it now. The the cool stuff

447
00:27:02,845 --> 00:27:06,685
Speaker 4:  is not there yet, right. Like this has been enabled on the level of

448
00:27:06,795 --> 00:27:10,245
Speaker 4:  what you might think of as RSS right now. Yeah, that's right. So they published

449
00:27:10,245 --> 00:27:13,485
Speaker 4:  something on the thread server, another server can pull it in.

450
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:17,565
Speaker 4:  There's no interactivity, there's no true interoperability. Right. You're

451
00:27:17,565 --> 00:27:21,405
Speaker 4:  just kind of pulling some content down. Right. That's still a big deal. Right.

452
00:27:21,405 --> 00:27:25,205
Speaker 4:  And for a company like Meta to be like, we will publish a a syndicated

453
00:27:25,355 --> 00:27:28,805
Speaker 4:  feed of content from our platforms, our social

454
00:27:29,045 --> 00:27:31,405
Speaker 4:  platforms still like a big deal. Right. But it's not the thing.

455
00:27:31,915 --> 00:27:35,805
Speaker 6:  Well and the beauty of it is this is the part that Meta has the least

456
00:27:35,835 --> 00:27:39,685
Speaker 6:  incentive to do, right? Yeah. Like all of the rest of it is

457
00:27:39,745 --> 00:27:43,045
Speaker 6:  better for Meta. Like the thing where in theory, like you described Neela,

458
00:27:43,045 --> 00:27:47,005
Speaker 6:  you can read Adam's posts on Threads in your ma on app that is

459
00:27:47,005 --> 00:27:50,765
Speaker 6:  a third party app. What Meta wants and what's ultimately good for

460
00:27:50,765 --> 00:27:54,445
Speaker 6:  Meta's business is when you can like or reply to that stuff and it funnels

461
00:27:54,445 --> 00:27:57,685
Speaker 6:  all the way back through that whole stack to Threads. Yeah. Right. So Adam

462
00:27:57,785 --> 00:28:00,405
Speaker 6:  can be in Threads and you can be in Mammoth and you can have a conversation

463
00:28:00,405 --> 00:28:04,325
Speaker 6:  with each other. That's where all of this wins. So you wouldn't do the thing

464
00:28:04,325 --> 00:28:07,365
Speaker 6:  where you just let your content go other places without

465
00:28:08,315 --> 00:28:11,005
Speaker 6:  real commitment to building all the stuff that brings it back and all the

466
00:28:11,005 --> 00:28:13,445
Speaker 6:  account sharing stuff they're gonna want to do because it'll bring people

467
00:28:13,465 --> 00:28:17,405
Speaker 6:  to Threads because Threads is the best platform for it. Like this is

468
00:28:17,425 --> 00:28:20,445
Speaker 6:  not the one part of it you would do if you weren't committed to doing the

469
00:28:20,445 --> 00:28:20,765
Speaker 6:  rest of it.

470
00:28:21,195 --> 00:28:24,885
Speaker 4:  Yeah, and I agree with you. I think what I had point out is the other part's

471
00:28:24,885 --> 00:28:28,045
Speaker 4:  way harder. Like building an RSS feed is like pretty easy, right? Way harder.

472
00:28:28,065 --> 00:28:31,365
Speaker 4:  The part, the part where you're like, okay, someone hit like in

473
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:35,325
Speaker 4:  Mammoth or Ivory or whatever it on client

474
00:28:35,635 --> 00:28:39,165
Speaker 4:  that like funneled to their server, which then talked back to our server

475
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:42,885
Speaker 4:  and that like showed up on the Threads app for somebody

476
00:28:43,465 --> 00:28:46,965
Speaker 4:  that's very complicated. There are real security challenges there. There

477
00:28:46,965 --> 00:28:50,405
Speaker 4:  are real content moderation challenges there. It's not just likes, it's also

478
00:28:50,845 --> 00:28:54,045
Speaker 4:  comments and replies, reposts, like all that stuff

479
00:28:54,905 --> 00:28:57,685
Speaker 4:  as you bring it back onto your server, you have to, you have to moderate

480
00:28:57,705 --> 00:29:01,005
Speaker 4:  it, you have to care about it all, whatever. And I think that's the stuff

481
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:04,205
Speaker 4:  that's yet to build. But you are correct that that is the stuff that accrues

482
00:29:04,205 --> 00:29:07,405
Speaker 4:  value back to Meta. 'cause it makes their community ultimately more vibrant.

483
00:29:07,905 --> 00:29:11,605
Speaker 4:  And I think what Meta thinks it's gonna sell is better product design, better

484
00:29:11,605 --> 00:29:15,525
Speaker 4:  user experience, better advertising, all this stuff. Which, you know,

485
00:29:16,035 --> 00:29:18,765
Speaker 4:  it's a, it's if you're Meta it's a pretty good bet to make that you will

486
00:29:18,855 --> 00:29:22,725
Speaker 4:  outdo a handful of massive on server admins on things like

487
00:29:22,725 --> 00:29:25,205
Speaker 4:  content moderation and and advertising integration. Yeah.

488
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:28,285
Speaker 6:  It was really interesting. I went back and when I was writing the post about

489
00:29:28,285 --> 00:29:32,205
Speaker 6:  this was just pulling some of meta's old quotes about this stuff from

490
00:29:32,265 --> 00:29:35,325
Speaker 6:  the last six months or so as they've been talking about this. And they've

491
00:29:35,325 --> 00:29:39,205
Speaker 6:  been surprisingly consistent in a way I didn't even realize. Like Mark Zuckerberg

492
00:29:39,205 --> 00:29:42,845
Speaker 6:  in particular has talked about this as a creator play.

493
00:29:43,185 --> 00:29:46,845
Speaker 6:  The idea is that this network of open systems

494
00:29:47,105 --> 00:29:50,205
Speaker 6:  is what creators are going to want because they've understood too many times

495
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,965
Speaker 6:  that if you build an audience in one place that is captive to that one place,

496
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:56,525
Speaker 6:  people will eventually leave or that place will fall apart or whatever. And

497
00:29:56,525 --> 00:29:59,605
Speaker 6:  then you have to start from nothing and nobody wants that. And so what Mark

498
00:29:59,605 --> 00:30:03,085
Speaker 6:  and Adam Mosseri have continued to say is the future is

499
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:07,365
Speaker 6:  these more portable, more interconnected systems. And what Meta is

500
00:30:07,365 --> 00:30:11,005
Speaker 6:  betting is that it can build creator tools, right? It can build the best

501
00:30:11,005 --> 00:30:14,725
Speaker 6:  stuff to use to post it can build the best AI things.

502
00:30:14,785 --> 00:30:18,645
Speaker 6:  It can like bring Tom Brady into your life in a weird AI way. It

503
00:30:18,645 --> 00:30:22,405
Speaker 6:  can monetize you better. Like Meta is actually sort of

504
00:30:22,435 --> 00:30:25,845
Speaker 6:  divorcing the idea of social networking is a good business. Which it turns

505
00:30:25,845 --> 00:30:29,205
Speaker 6:  out it's not everybody has figured this out and leaning into we're gonna

506
00:30:29,205 --> 00:30:32,325
Speaker 6:  outsource all of the like hanging out with your friends bits of this and

507
00:30:32,325 --> 00:30:36,165
Speaker 6:  we're just going to win at how people make money on these platforms. And

508
00:30:36,725 --> 00:30:39,965
Speaker 6:  I actually think if I'm Meta, that's a pretty good bet because Meta has proven

509
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:41,565
Speaker 6:  over and over it's better at that than everybody.

510
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:45,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And I, I think it also creates opportunities

511
00:30:45,665 --> 00:30:49,485
Speaker 4:  for those creators or media companies in different ways. Like everyone

512
00:30:49,485 --> 00:30:51,805
Speaker 4:  knows what I, we're gonna do it somehow. don don't know how we're gonna do

513
00:30:51,805 --> 00:30:53,285
Speaker 4:  it, but if

514
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:55,125
Speaker 6:  You keep saying it, it'll eventually happen. It's,

515
00:30:55,225 --> 00:30:58,405
Speaker 4:  I'm just gonna horsepower this thing into his existence. Look, we had, I'll,

516
00:30:58,405 --> 00:31:01,085
Speaker 4:  I'll just give you some inside baseball. Our company had an all hands today

517
00:31:01,085 --> 00:31:04,245
Speaker 4:  just before we're recording and our CEO said the word fedi verse during the

518
00:31:04,245 --> 00:31:05,805
Speaker 4:  all hands. And I was like, I did it. You cheer.

519
00:31:06,025 --> 00:31:08,725
Speaker 6:  He did kind of say it like it was written on a piece of paper in front of

520
00:31:08,725 --> 00:31:10,165
Speaker 6:  him, but he'd never seen it before. Like I was

521
00:31:10,565 --> 00:31:13,165
Speaker 4:  Standing behind the curtain with a knife. You know, say it,

522
00:31:17,595 --> 00:31:17,885
Speaker 6:  That

523
00:31:17,885 --> 00:31:20,685
Speaker 4:  Just means I've said it enough that other people think they should say, which

524
00:31:20,685 --> 00:31:24,325
Speaker 4:  is victory one. But I'll just use another example.

525
00:31:25,555 --> 00:31:28,925
Speaker 4:  Threads lately has been very thirsty for Sports Threads. Yeah. I don Dunno

526
00:31:28,925 --> 00:31:31,805
Speaker 4:  if you know this, they, they start out, they are a bunch of F1 fans over

527
00:31:31,885 --> 00:31:35,285
Speaker 4:  there. So they even in Myer's video about launching in Europe today, he's

528
00:31:35,285 --> 00:31:38,325
Speaker 4:  like, we want to bring sports communities that are deeply rooted in Europe.

529
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:41,925
Speaker 4:  Like F1. Yep. Which is an amazing way to say F1 is kind of fussy.

530
00:31:42,475 --> 00:31:45,165
Speaker 6:  They did a whole thing with the NBA at the end season tournament. The other

531
00:31:45,165 --> 00:31:47,045
Speaker 6:  thing that was happening in Vegas. Yes. While I was there, they were like,

532
00:31:47,045 --> 00:31:50,805
Speaker 6:  they were a big sponsor. They brought in all the ESPN peoples ESPN's having

533
00:31:50,965 --> 00:31:54,725
Speaker 6:  this fight with, with Elon Musk and and Twitter. So they're all coming like

534
00:31:54,725 --> 00:31:56,285
Speaker 6:  it's, it's a, it's a thing that's happening.

535
00:31:56,465 --> 00:32:00,405
Speaker 4:  So if I was running ESPN today, I would not be like, you

536
00:32:00,405 --> 00:32:03,575
Speaker 4:  can have my reporters for free. Right? Yeah. You

537
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:08,175
Speaker 4:  woe is not gonna tweet scoops for free on Threads the way that he's been

538
00:32:08,175 --> 00:32:11,415
Speaker 4:  doing for Twitter. I'm setting up a Mastodon server

539
00:32:12,355 --> 00:32:16,015
Speaker 4:  and you can federate with us if you pay us the money for

540
00:32:16,015 --> 00:32:19,855
Speaker 4:  access to the the people. And that is just a new way of thinking

541
00:32:19,865 --> 00:32:23,815
Speaker 4:  about these businesses that it, I I, you know,

542
00:32:23,855 --> 00:32:26,695
Speaker 4:  a bunch of media executives like don't like thinking new ways. They're like,

543
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,575
Speaker 4:  what if we make YouTube videos? Like that's like how they all think,

544
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:34,415
Speaker 4:  have you heard of this platform? It's called TikTok. Like these are the dinners

545
00:32:34,415 --> 00:32:38,375
Speaker 4:  I go to. But they are all starting to think now, okay, well how

546
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:41,045
Speaker 4:  do we actually get paid for the stuff beyond just being like, we can make

547
00:32:41,045 --> 00:32:44,445
Speaker 4:  it go viral better than anybody else. And so there's just new

548
00:32:44,445 --> 00:32:48,405
Speaker 4:  opportunities for companies for creators to stand

549
00:32:48,405 --> 00:32:52,125
Speaker 4:  up their own services and say, look, if you want access to us, like we need

550
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:55,245
Speaker 4:  some revenue sharing terms or you need to let us put advertising into our

551
00:32:55,335 --> 00:32:58,525
Speaker 4:  feeds the same way that you let Instagram creators put advertising into their

552
00:32:58,535 --> 00:33:02,325
Speaker 4:  feeds. And I, I just, I dunno if any of that's gonna work. I truly

553
00:33:02,345 --> 00:33:06,165
Speaker 4:  do not know if any of that's gonna work. I know that it's new and

554
00:33:06,225 --> 00:33:09,365
Speaker 4:  no one has actually, like, I can't point to anything else that has ever worked

555
00:33:09,365 --> 00:33:13,005
Speaker 4:  like that and I can't point to anything else that could work like that. And

556
00:33:13,005 --> 00:33:16,725
Speaker 4:  so like new things are just like fundamentally exciting to me. 'cause I think

557
00:33:16,725 --> 00:33:20,685
Speaker 4:  the way it shakes out will be different or potentially better

558
00:33:21,105 --> 00:33:24,965
Speaker 4:  or potentially way worse. But it's new, right? Like I'm just on the

559
00:33:24,965 --> 00:33:27,845
Speaker 4:  hunt for new, like we've been doing it the, we've been doing it the platform

560
00:33:27,845 --> 00:33:31,765
Speaker 4:  way for like 10 years. We just ran our big package on Twitter being

561
00:33:31,765 --> 00:33:35,725
Speaker 4:  dead, which don don't know if people call it like Twitter is dead.

562
00:33:35,755 --> 00:33:39,485
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's not that we called it dead. Elon Musk killed the

563
00:33:39,485 --> 00:33:43,445
Speaker 4:  company and he renamed it X Linda Yao was on our

564
00:33:43,445 --> 00:33:46,525
Speaker 4:  stage at code and she's like, Twitter is dead, it's called X now.

565
00:33:47,675 --> 00:33:51,525
Speaker 4:  Okay, Twitter's dead, this is it, whatever. But inside of that I wrote a

566
00:33:51,525 --> 00:33:55,485
Speaker 4:  big piece, but it's just like what the platform era of media did to all of

567
00:33:55,485 --> 00:33:59,245
Speaker 4:  us. And it just, Ezra Klein is in that, and we talked about it on the Wednesday

568
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:03,005
Speaker 4:  show, but I just repeat this. He's like, Twitter increased the

569
00:34:03,005 --> 00:34:06,525
Speaker 4:  scale of our communication and it reduced our ability to communicate.

570
00:34:07,785 --> 00:34:11,205
Speaker 4:  And what if we just like did some other stuff and I, I promise you this ActivityPub

571
00:34:11,205 --> 00:34:14,685
Speaker 4:  stuff, it's at least the thing that creates the opportunity

572
00:34:15,225 --> 00:34:18,805
Speaker 4:  for people to think in new in different ways. It might not be the thing,

573
00:34:18,805 --> 00:34:22,525
Speaker 4:  it might not work, but I just, I just have not seen so many people

574
00:34:22,825 --> 00:34:26,085
Speaker 4:  having new ideas about the internet in a long time.

575
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:30,665
Speaker 5:  What about social media in particular? But I kind

576
00:34:30,665 --> 00:34:34,225
Speaker 5:  of, one big question about this whole integration. What happens for people

577
00:34:34,285 --> 00:34:38,225
Speaker 5:  who have like a lot of followers on Mastodon and also have a

578
00:34:38,225 --> 00:34:40,785
Speaker 5:  Threads account, what do they do?

579
00:34:41,445 --> 00:34:44,505
Speaker 6:  So this is, I would argue one of the most fun

580
00:34:44,815 --> 00:34:48,025
Speaker 6:  conversations about this right now because no one knows the answer to that

581
00:34:48,185 --> 00:34:50,665
Speaker 6:  question because there, there is a way of thinking about it that is like,

582
00:34:50,745 --> 00:34:54,625
Speaker 6:  I have one omnibus fedi verse account, right? Yeah. That

583
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:58,025
Speaker 6:  it is, it is my, it would be the equivalent of having one account that worked

584
00:34:58,025 --> 00:35:01,545
Speaker 6:  across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and everywhere else, right?

585
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:05,345
Speaker 6:  Your single account, you can actually make a really good case that that doesn't

586
00:35:05,345 --> 00:35:08,465
Speaker 6:  make any sense. That actually what you're gonna want is a couple of different

587
00:35:08,465 --> 00:35:11,585
Speaker 6:  accounts in different places and that the upside is that

588
00:35:12,325 --> 00:35:16,185
Speaker 6:  you choose where you post and to what. And so like you could use

589
00:35:16,185 --> 00:35:20,025
Speaker 6:  your Mastodon account for just like tweeting about the cool new glasses that

590
00:35:20,025 --> 00:35:22,545
Speaker 6:  you got and your Threads account could be your work account and that maybe

591
00:35:22,545 --> 00:35:26,505
Speaker 6:  those things being separate is useful. But the upside of it is

592
00:35:26,665 --> 00:35:29,505
Speaker 6:  that if I wanna read your work account where I have my personal account,

593
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:32,865
Speaker 6:  I can, right? So it's all sort of platform agnostic. but there might be a

594
00:35:32,865 --> 00:35:36,785
Speaker 6:  world in which people want lots of different accounts for different

595
00:35:37,315 --> 00:35:39,165
Speaker 6:  uses but that just gets bonkers.

596
00:35:40,715 --> 00:35:44,645
Speaker 6:  Like, oh I have 10 accounts for 10 different things. But you can

597
00:35:44,645 --> 00:35:48,605
Speaker 6:  access any of them from anywhere is like the, the UI of that totally

598
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:52,405
Speaker 6:  falls apart if we don't do it correctly. So I don't know. My guess would

599
00:35:52,405 --> 00:35:56,005
Speaker 6:  be, if I had to bet on something, I would guess that a lot of people will

600
00:35:56,005 --> 00:35:58,845
Speaker 6:  get Threads accounts because Threads is gonna be, it's gonna be the Gmail

601
00:35:59,065 --> 00:36:02,765
Speaker 6:  of this space for a while and then it'll just be sort of the

602
00:36:02,765 --> 00:36:06,725
Speaker 6:  default one to have and then we'll get to see how it

603
00:36:06,725 --> 00:36:10,165
Speaker 6:  plays out in lots of different directions. But right now, like I think a

604
00:36:10,165 --> 00:36:13,245
Speaker 6:  lot of us, we've talked about this on the show, we sort of bet on Threads

605
00:36:14,035 --> 00:36:17,965
Speaker 6:  betting A, that it would eventually integrate with ActivityPub and B, that

606
00:36:17,965 --> 00:36:20,885
Speaker 6:  it was probably gonna be the biggest platform for a while. And there are

607
00:36:20,885 --> 00:36:23,645
Speaker 6:  real values to being on the biggest platform. So like I've spent more time

608
00:36:23,825 --> 00:36:27,245
Speaker 6:  on Threads than Mastodon. So when it comes to it, I will probably end up

609
00:36:28,195 --> 00:36:32,005
Speaker 6:  investing more in my Threads account over time than my Mastodon account.

610
00:36:32,305 --> 00:36:35,245
Speaker 6:  But will I keep the MAs don? Don't know. This is also weird and this is why

611
00:36:35,245 --> 00:36:38,685
Speaker 6:  it's fun. Like to NE's point, like this is a new thing we've never actually

612
00:36:38,685 --> 00:36:39,525
Speaker 6:  had to figure out before.

613
00:36:39,915 --> 00:36:42,605
Speaker 5:  I've, I've been talking with other friends about this too because like I,

614
00:36:42,685 --> 00:36:45,445
Speaker 5:  I don't, I never really used Mastodon. I've got like an account there, but

615
00:36:45,445 --> 00:36:48,445
Speaker 5:  it just is like a placeholder of more than anything else. But I know people

616
00:36:48,445 --> 00:36:52,365
Speaker 5:  who are like very, very active on Mastodon and as they started seeing Threads

617
00:36:52,365 --> 00:36:54,405
Speaker 5:  getting bigger, they're like, okay, well we'll go start an account there.

618
00:36:54,505 --> 00:36:58,285
Speaker 5:  And so now they're active on both and one, how do you have the energy? Yeah,

619
00:36:58,285 --> 00:37:01,965
Speaker 5:  I understand but two like I was like well what's the calculus then? Like

620
00:37:02,435 --> 00:37:06,245
Speaker 5:  when, when, when this all interacts, do you maintain both accounts? You

621
00:37:06,245 --> 00:37:08,725
Speaker 5:  kill it and they're like I genuinely don't know. Yeah,

622
00:37:08,725 --> 00:37:09,725
Speaker 6:  I don't think anybody does. Yeah.

623
00:37:09,845 --> 00:37:10,245
Speaker 5:  NO

624
00:37:10,555 --> 00:37:13,685
Speaker 4:  Yeah I I think there's some real value

625
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:17,365
Speaker 4:  to having different places for different things.

626
00:37:18,005 --> 00:37:18,605
Speaker 5:  A hundred percent

627
00:37:19,575 --> 00:37:23,245
Speaker 4:  These were all people. I do not know how people are like being

628
00:37:23,635 --> 00:37:27,045
Speaker 4:  goblins on Blue Sky and then being whatever LinkedIn version of themselves

629
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:27,445
Speaker 4:  they're on

630
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:31,245
Speaker 6:  Threads also goblins, different kind of goblin but still pretty goblin engage

631
00:37:31,245 --> 00:37:31,445
Speaker 6:  there.

632
00:37:31,445 --> 00:37:33,645
Speaker 5:  Were in Go, were wearing a little tie on on Threads

633
00:37:35,505 --> 00:37:38,725
Speaker 4:  But like I can see a world again I don dunno if any of this will work. I

634
00:37:38,725 --> 00:37:40,645
Speaker 4:  don Dunno if this is a good idea. I don Dunno if, you know if we can build

635
00:37:40,645 --> 00:37:44,125
Speaker 4:  any of this, but I can just see a world where my work

636
00:37:45,195 --> 00:37:48,605
Speaker 4:  personality tweeting about tech and silliness

637
00:37:49,035 --> 00:37:52,885
Speaker 4:  happens at, you know, neli at The Verge dot com

638
00:37:53,185 --> 00:37:55,485
Speaker 4:  and you can follow that on Threads and that shows up in our homepage and

639
00:37:55,485 --> 00:37:58,165
Speaker 4:  those are quick posts and those get federated and you can you just follow

640
00:37:58,185 --> 00:38:02,165
Speaker 4:  me where you are and then tweeting about Aaron Rogers

641
00:38:02,165 --> 00:38:06,045
Speaker 4:  happens somewhere else. Right? Right. And that just

642
00:38:06,045 --> 00:38:09,725
Speaker 4:  seems better and maybe, maybe you want to, to

643
00:38:09,795 --> 00:38:13,765
Speaker 4:  slam all that stuff together. Maybe some people will, but it just feels like

644
00:38:13,945 --> 00:38:17,765
Speaker 4:  for too long we have just slammed too many things

645
00:38:18,085 --> 00:38:21,685
Speaker 4:  together. Right. And actually being like, okay I've built one distribution

646
00:38:21,685 --> 00:38:25,245
Speaker 4:  channel for one kind of audience that I can cultivate and grow

647
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:29,045
Speaker 4:  and I can build another distribution channel for my friends or my family

648
00:38:29,755 --> 00:38:33,165
Speaker 4:  that isn't like a wholesale platform shift.

649
00:38:34,165 --> 00:38:38,105
Speaker 4:  Like I'm this person on Instagram in the format of short videos.

650
00:38:39,005 --> 00:38:42,385
Speaker 4:  I'm this person on Twitter in the format of deeply

651
00:38:42,665 --> 00:38:46,385
Speaker 4:  snarky text posts, right? Like I'm the most nihilistic version of myself

652
00:38:46,385 --> 00:38:50,225
Speaker 4:  on Twitter and I'm this person on threat. Like that having

653
00:38:50,225 --> 00:38:54,065
Speaker 4:  the format dictate what kind of thing you're doing I think

654
00:38:54,085 --> 00:38:57,585
Speaker 4:  has forced just, it just caused a lot of weird shit to happen.

655
00:38:58,015 --> 00:39:00,625
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And I think saying, okay, yeah we can have lots of different feeds,

656
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:04,425
Speaker 4:  we lots different accounts and you can act, you're kind of format independent

657
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,585
Speaker 4:  but you're chasing different things. Again new, I don't have any of that's

658
00:39:07,585 --> 00:39:08,585
Speaker 4:  gonna work. Yeah, well I

659
00:39:08,625 --> 00:39:11,945
Speaker 5:  I think, I think that it, that trips me up there is is you know, this kind

660
00:39:12,105 --> 00:39:15,025
Speaker 5:  of stuff. We've been doing more than one account for a while now, right?

661
00:39:15,025 --> 00:39:18,985
Speaker 5:  Like Finsta accounts and stuff like that. But what

662
00:39:18,985 --> 00:39:22,065
Speaker 5:  happens is people inevitably go and have that one account because that's

663
00:39:22,065 --> 00:39:25,705
Speaker 5:  where they have the most interaction. Yeah. And so like are you really gonna

664
00:39:25,705 --> 00:39:26,945
Speaker 5:  wanna take your

665
00:39:29,545 --> 00:39:32,945
Speaker 5:  reckless at Green Bay Packers social

666
00:39:33,975 --> 00:39:37,545
Speaker 5:  account and and only use that when you have like 50

667
00:39:37,545 --> 00:39:41,105
Speaker 5:  followers Who there who also have the same feelings about Aaron Rogers? I

668
00:39:41,105 --> 00:39:45,025
Speaker 5:  assume more than 50 people have those feelings. They do. But like is, you

669
00:39:45,025 --> 00:39:47,745
Speaker 5:  know, are you gonna wanna do that? And then when you have this much bigger

670
00:39:47,745 --> 00:39:50,825
Speaker 5:  mouthpiece over here and I'm just really curious how people are gonna do

671
00:39:50,895 --> 00:39:51,505
Speaker 5:  feel about that.

672
00:39:51,945 --> 00:39:55,065
Speaker 4:  I feel, I just want to say this now and this is, I

673
00:39:55,065 --> 00:39:56,185
Speaker 5:  Apologize. This is about Aaron Rogers.

674
00:39:56,335 --> 00:40:00,145
Speaker 4:  I've, I've given him even more attention. Let's talk about Jordan Love

675
00:40:00,145 --> 00:40:03,985
Speaker 4:  or I call him Flag Hart. He's great. I need an account just for that just

676
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:07,785
Speaker 4:  to make Flag Hartt social. It's when you, when you type

677
00:40:07,945 --> 00:40:11,905
Speaker 4:  Jordan love's name into the iPhone to text your, your group chat about

678
00:40:11,905 --> 00:40:15,825
Speaker 4:  it, it replaces it with a Jordanian flag and a heart icons.

679
00:40:15,825 --> 00:40:18,305
Speaker 4:  Now we just call 'em flag heart. It's very good. We can make this happen

680
00:40:18,665 --> 00:40:18,785
Speaker 4:  together.

681
00:40:20,765 --> 00:40:22,505
Speaker 4:  Jordan, if you're listening and I know that you are,

682
00:40:24,165 --> 00:40:26,865
Speaker 4:  can I meet your wife and Jordan Love and drive your truck?

683
00:40:28,525 --> 00:40:32,425
Speaker 4:  That's a road trip I would enjoy. I would go on that trip in a heartbeat.

684
00:40:33,535 --> 00:40:36,025
Speaker 4:  Just the weirdest four people in a cyber truck.

685
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:38,435
Speaker 7:  So get quiet.

686
00:40:39,455 --> 00:40:41,355
Speaker 4:  So two of you are world class athletes.

687
00:40:44,495 --> 00:40:48,395
Speaker 4:  Yes. How's it go? Both of us were very active on Reddit

688
00:40:48,395 --> 00:40:49,035
Speaker 4:  when we were younger.

689
00:40:54,295 --> 00:40:54,915
Speaker 7:  Oh boy.

690
00:40:56,415 --> 00:40:59,435
Speaker 4:  Anyway, I'm excited about it. I think it's really fun if you have a master

691
00:40:59,435 --> 00:41:03,275
Speaker 4:  account, just like do it do the thing. Follow Myer's already

692
00:41:03,275 --> 00:41:06,035
Speaker 4:  the third most followed person in the Fed verse by by one chart that I saw.

693
00:41:06,035 --> 00:41:09,915
Speaker 4:  Which is wild. Yeah. Follow some people on Threads. Like just try

694
00:41:09,915 --> 00:41:13,835
Speaker 4:  it out like it will change your brain a little bit. Right? It's like

695
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:17,515
Speaker 4:  a follow button that you just don't expect to exist and you're like oh this

696
00:41:17,515 --> 00:41:21,475
Speaker 4:  is better. Like there's just something better about it being like, oh

697
00:41:21,495 --> 00:41:23,475
Speaker 4:  I'm in much more control of this situation.

698
00:41:25,075 --> 00:41:28,795
Speaker 4:  I don. I think, I think it's gonna be I don Dunno about great but it's gonna

699
00:41:28,795 --> 00:41:31,555
Speaker 4:  be different And I'm definitely in the market for different Yeah

700
00:41:31,735 --> 00:41:32,155
Speaker 5:  Agreed.

Speaker 9:  Thank you for having me yet again.

705
00:43:57,905 --> 00:44:01,845
Speaker 4:  I'm very excited to talk to you. You spent every single day in the courtroom

706
00:44:02,185 --> 00:44:05,965
Speaker 4:  for the Epic v Google trial. You were there when the verdict came in, which

707
00:44:05,965 --> 00:44:06,805
Speaker 4:  was very fast.

708
00:44:07,345 --> 00:44:09,925
Speaker 1:  Was it like a month was the whole thing Sean? How long? How long has

709
00:44:09,925 --> 00:44:13,845
Speaker 9:  It been? I spent a Fortnite in Fortnite court because it was, it was

710
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:17,605
Speaker 9:  14 actual days of bigot court. I know a Fortnite includes nights too,

711
00:44:18,085 --> 00:44:21,845
Speaker 9:  whatever. But yes, the trial lasted like four weeks plus

712
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:25,605
Speaker 9:  like one day we had Fridays off,

713
00:44:25,665 --> 00:44:29,645
Speaker 9:  but I spent 14 actual days in the courtroom. And on

714
00:44:29,645 --> 00:44:33,405
Speaker 9:  this last day we expected the verdict

715
00:44:33,575 --> 00:44:37,525
Speaker 9:  might come in quickly for Google and

716
00:44:37,665 --> 00:44:41,365
Speaker 9:  it came in quickly for Epic. And none of me, none, not

717
00:44:41,365 --> 00:44:44,525
Speaker 9:  myself, not any of the other courtroom reporters expected that. That was

718
00:44:44,605 --> 00:44:45,525
Speaker 9:  a huge surprise.

719
00:44:45,905 --> 00:44:49,405
Speaker 4:  So I just wanna congratulate Sean here inside baseball. Sean beat

720
00:44:49,765 --> 00:44:53,485
Speaker 4:  everyone by minutes if not hours to publishing

721
00:44:53,665 --> 00:44:57,445
Speaker 4:  the story of the verdict. So congratulations Sean. Well well played the

722
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:58,685
Speaker 9:  Power of a pre-written stub.

723
00:44:58,895 --> 00:45:00,805
Speaker 4:  Don't tell the people how we do it.

724
00:45:01,755 --> 00:45:05,565
Speaker 6:  Sean wrote 65 stories for every possible outcome. Sean

725
00:45:05,565 --> 00:45:06,845
Speaker 4:  Hollister in the multiverse

726
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,965
Speaker 9:  It was, it was four a pre-route. Four stories.

727
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:12,045
Speaker 4:  That's

728
00:45:12,045 --> 00:45:15,245
Speaker 6:  Ridiculous. So there's a version where Google wins one, where Epic wins one

729
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:18,645
Speaker 6:  where like the courtroom explodes. Yeah. And then one where the judge is

730
00:45:18,645 --> 00:45:20,005
Speaker 6:  just like, nevermind. Get outta here. All

731
00:45:20,005 --> 00:45:22,405
Speaker 4:  Of you by iPhones get out of my face.

732
00:45:23,235 --> 00:45:23,725
Speaker 9:  Exactly.

733
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:29,445
Speaker 4:  So Epic won. It was a runaway victory

734
00:45:29,475 --> 00:45:33,045
Speaker 4:  that Google found for it on every claim. That's the

735
00:45:33,365 --> 00:45:37,085
Speaker 4:  headline. Let's back up here. A lot of people are very familiar

736
00:45:37,315 --> 00:45:40,845
Speaker 4:  with Apple, the Epic in which Apple won on virtually every claim.

737
00:45:41,255 --> 00:45:45,165
Speaker 4:  There are some key differences in the trial. What were

738
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:47,685
Speaker 4:  these cases about and what were those differences?

739
00:45:48,185 --> 00:45:51,685
Speaker 9:  Oh my gosh, So I actually have an

740
00:45:52,075 --> 00:45:55,925
Speaker 9:  outline of the differences. 'cause this is the question on everybody's mind.

741
00:45:56,345 --> 00:45:59,845
Speaker 9:  How could Google possibly have lost this case

742
00:46:00,355 --> 00:46:04,125
Speaker 9:  when Apple one isn't Apple? The obvious

743
00:46:04,175 --> 00:46:08,125
Speaker 9:  monopolist with the walled garden and everything like that. But a

744
00:46:08,125 --> 00:46:12,005
Speaker 9:  whole bunch of things that I'd, I'd heard and and read told me that

745
00:46:12,005 --> 00:46:14,845
Speaker 9:  these were very different. First off, the lawyers for both sides were telling

746
00:46:14,845 --> 00:46:18,405
Speaker 9:  me before we began, these are logistically different cases with different

747
00:46:18,605 --> 00:46:22,485
Speaker 9:  evidences, different judges. The apple verdict doesn't carry any weight

748
00:46:22,485 --> 00:46:26,085
Speaker 9:  here. And not only that, they were not able to bring up the

749
00:46:26,085 --> 00:46:28,925
Speaker 9:  application in the courtroom. The judge said, you don't talk about this.

750
00:46:29,545 --> 00:46:33,445
Speaker 9:  So carries no weight at all. The next big thing

751
00:46:33,445 --> 00:46:37,325
Speaker 9:  of course is that Google controls its ecosystem with all

752
00:46:37,325 --> 00:46:41,045
Speaker 9:  these third party business deals. Whereas Apple's its own OEM,

753
00:46:41,055 --> 00:46:44,565
Speaker 9:  there are more unfair looking documents in more hands

754
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:48,645
Speaker 9:  because Google had to like hand out all these contracts to these

755
00:46:48,645 --> 00:46:49,325
Speaker 9:  different companies.

756
00:46:49,685 --> 00:46:53,525
Speaker 6:  Google just has to like send more emails with more attachments. Like literally

757
00:46:53,585 --> 00:46:55,125
Speaker 6:  it feels like that was a big part of this. Yeah,

758
00:46:55,905 --> 00:46:56,805
Speaker 4:  Emails. Yeah,

759
00:46:57,605 --> 00:46:58,005
Speaker 9:  Absolutely Emails.

760
00:46:58,185 --> 00:47:00,605
Speaker 4:  I'm just telling you it's a one word that means everything. And you can buy

761
00:47:00,685 --> 00:47:01,245
Speaker 4:  a shirt and

762
00:47:01,575 --> 00:47:04,605
Speaker 9:  We've known this for like ages now. We wrote a piece in what,

763
00:47:04,605 --> 00:47:08,405
Speaker 9:  20 11, 20 12. one of the first years of The Verge about the

764
00:47:08,585 --> 00:47:12,365
Speaker 9:  Sky Hook case where we saw how Google tries to control the ecosystem

765
00:47:12,365 --> 00:47:16,165
Speaker 9:  through all these contracts. But so many of them came out in this moment

766
00:47:16,545 --> 00:47:20,005
Speaker 9:  and so many of 'em looked unfair. And I don't know if like

767
00:47:20,185 --> 00:47:24,045
Speaker 9:  unfair would've swayed a judge, but I think it may have swayed a

768
00:47:24,045 --> 00:47:27,965
Speaker 9:  jury who looked at these like blatantly unfair, Spotify

769
00:47:28,155 --> 00:47:31,885
Speaker 9:  gets to pay, you know, nothing to Google to be in the Google Play store while

770
00:47:31,885 --> 00:47:35,525
Speaker 9:  other companies have to pay 26 or 30%. Like that seems

771
00:47:35,755 --> 00:47:39,645
Speaker 9:  blatantly unfair. The jury saw that, they saw Google trying to

772
00:47:39,645 --> 00:47:43,445
Speaker 9:  keep it secret and they didn't like that jury in front of a bench.

773
00:47:43,445 --> 00:47:47,165
Speaker 9:  That's one of the big things here. They saw that Google had a lot

774
00:47:47,325 --> 00:47:49,755
Speaker 9:  of things to hide, especially

775
00:47:51,255 --> 00:47:54,955
Speaker 9:  all of these chats between various executives that were being auto

776
00:47:55,065 --> 00:47:58,875
Speaker 9:  deleted by the corporate policy at the time for

777
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:02,715
Speaker 9:  for, for, for document retention. The judge is like, what the fuck

778
00:48:02,855 --> 00:48:06,475
Speaker 9:  Google, you're supposed to keep the documents

779
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:09,875
Speaker 9:  for us so that we can look at them in the courtroom. And Google was like,

780
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:11,475
Speaker 9:  nah, we never change any of that stuff. Ooh.

781
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:14,275
Speaker 6:  So wait, can I just say one thing about this actually? 'cause I was, I was

782
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:17,835
Speaker 6:  in court for USV Google when Sundar Pcha was

783
00:48:17,835 --> 00:48:21,795
Speaker 6:  testifying and they brought this up to him too and he absolutely

784
00:48:22,135 --> 00:48:26,075
Speaker 6:  won that interaction, which was so fascinating to

785
00:48:26,075 --> 00:48:29,555
Speaker 6:  me because the case that he made essentially was there was this one thread

786
00:48:29,555 --> 00:48:33,275
Speaker 6:  that they brought up with him in which the last thing you see is him saying,

787
00:48:34,215 --> 00:48:37,395
Speaker 6:  can you turn off history please? And so they turn off history and that's

788
00:48:37,395 --> 00:48:39,435
Speaker 6:  obviously the end of the thing 'cause they stop storing it. So they bring

789
00:48:39,435 --> 00:48:43,035
Speaker 6:  this up and they give s this whole long spiel about, you know, you're destroying

790
00:48:43,235 --> 00:48:46,515
Speaker 6:  evidence, this is a disaster. And, and his response is essentially, well,

791
00:48:46,535 --> 00:48:49,355
Speaker 6:  did you find any more versions of that happening? And they were like, how

792
00:48:49,355 --> 00:48:51,435
Speaker 6:  would we know you deleted it? And he was like, well you found this one because

793
00:48:51,555 --> 00:48:54,715
Speaker 6:  I asked them to turn off history. Did you find any other times where to turn

794
00:48:54,715 --> 00:48:58,555
Speaker 6:  off history? And and the lawyer goes, no, and that's the end. And Sunar just

795
00:48:58,555 --> 00:49:02,515
Speaker 6:  like victorious sits back and it, that immediately went away

796
00:49:02,575 --> 00:49:05,995
Speaker 6:  in USV Google and it was such a non-issue, but in this one it just

797
00:49:06,385 --> 00:49:07,595
Speaker 6:  kept being part of

798
00:49:07,595 --> 00:49:10,315
Speaker 4:  The trial. Can I, can I want Sean to, to get into this, I just wanna point

799
00:49:10,315 --> 00:49:14,155
Speaker 4:  something out that I think is often forgotten when we cover the legal

800
00:49:14,155 --> 00:49:17,835
Speaker 4:  system. One, we have an audience of tech people and people believe the legal

801
00:49:17,835 --> 00:49:21,755
Speaker 4:  system is deterministic. Like it's an algorithm, like you put in

802
00:49:21,755 --> 00:49:25,675
Speaker 4:  some inputs and you get an output and you can predict the output. Not true.

803
00:49:25,955 --> 00:49:29,875
Speaker 4:  I, I think this we are, we've learned over and over again in America

804
00:49:30,265 --> 00:49:33,635
Speaker 4:  over the past couple, not true, almost completely random, especially when

805
00:49:33,635 --> 00:49:37,515
Speaker 4:  there's a jury involved and then I'm a lawyer and

806
00:49:37,515 --> 00:49:39,915
Speaker 4:  I'm married to a lawyer and I have a lot of friends who are lawyers. So I'm

807
00:49:39,915 --> 00:49:42,635
Speaker 4:  just gonna say this and we can all just react to it however you want. Some

808
00:49:42,635 --> 00:49:44,875
Speaker 4:  lawyers are better than other lawyers

809
00:49:48,535 --> 00:49:52,315
Speaker 4:  and if you're Epic, you can afford really good lawyers,

810
00:49:53,175 --> 00:49:55,235
Speaker 4:  and if you are the United States government

811
00:49:56,705 --> 00:49:57,515
Speaker 5:  Hire better.

812
00:49:59,465 --> 00:50:03,195
Speaker 4:  It's just right, like prosecutors

813
00:50:03,465 --> 00:50:03,755
Speaker 4:  like

814
00:50:05,455 --> 00:50:08,235
Speaker 4:  you, you just see it. I, I, you know, it's like, I'm just like, you could

815
00:50:08,235 --> 00:50:12,035
Speaker 4:  just react to that however you want, but you can just see that

816
00:50:12,105 --> 00:50:15,915
Speaker 4:  some lawyers are better than other lawyers. And there's, that's a real

817
00:50:16,315 --> 00:50:18,195
Speaker 4:  difference in these cases for sure.

818
00:50:18,505 --> 00:50:22,195
Speaker 9:  Epic afforded some really good lawyers here. Yeah, I I, I was very impressed

819
00:50:22,305 --> 00:50:25,435
Speaker 9:  with how, just how much and how often

820
00:50:26,105 --> 00:50:29,835
Speaker 9:  they put the witnesses on edge and, and turned Google's

821
00:50:29,995 --> 00:50:33,515
Speaker 9:  witnesses against Google and all the, all these things. I was surprised that

822
00:50:33,675 --> 00:50:37,315
Speaker 9:  Google's lawyers didn't have a better defense, but they

823
00:50:37,585 --> 00:50:41,475
Speaker 9:  were in a very difficult position here because Epic spun this

824
00:50:41,475 --> 00:50:45,075
Speaker 9:  whole thing as this tale of good and evil with all of these

825
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:48,915
Speaker 9:  unfair documents on the table. And Google was left to explain

826
00:50:48,985 --> 00:50:52,635
Speaker 9:  away all these complicated business deals, which might make

827
00:50:52,685 --> 00:50:56,235
Speaker 9:  sense and might might've even convinced a judge, Hey, this is just normal

828
00:50:56,515 --> 00:50:59,315
Speaker 9:  business practices. You've seen this in your courtroom a thousand times,

829
00:50:59,855 --> 00:51:03,195
Speaker 9:  but the jury hasn't. The jury hasn't seen all these unfair deals

830
00:51:04,055 --> 00:51:07,915
Speaker 9:  and Epic constantly. Every Google executive

831
00:51:07,915 --> 00:51:11,075
Speaker 9:  that came under the stand, every Google witness that was there

832
00:51:11,815 --> 00:51:15,395
Speaker 9:  got grilled hard about their emails and about these

833
00:51:15,395 --> 00:51:18,995
Speaker 9:  deleted chats, you know? Oh, I love it. How, how will we ever know what's

834
00:51:18,995 --> 00:51:22,875
Speaker 9:  in your, what's in your chats? You'll never know. So Sundar though, the

835
00:51:22,875 --> 00:51:26,675
Speaker 9:  judge was willing to let Sundar pass the buck Epic's lawyer

836
00:51:26,775 --> 00:51:29,555
Speaker 9:  was all like, you know, you're res you, you agree that you're responsible

837
00:51:29,555 --> 00:51:33,315
Speaker 9:  for everything that goes on at Google. Right? But after the jury filed

838
00:51:33,375 --> 00:51:37,235
Speaker 9:  out of the courtroom, judge Donato was, you know, okay, okay, Sundar,

839
00:51:38,515 --> 00:51:42,355
Speaker 9:  I, I, I, I accept that you got bat advice from your lawyers,

840
00:51:42,605 --> 00:51:46,215
Speaker 9:  maybe, but I want the buck to stop with somebody.

841
00:51:47,165 --> 00:51:51,155
Speaker 9:  Bring your chief legal officer into court. So the judge hauled in

842
00:51:51,835 --> 00:51:55,755
Speaker 9:  Google's chief legal officer for over, I wanna

843
00:51:55,755 --> 00:51:59,715
Speaker 9:  say over an hour of questioning about how the heck got this happened.

844
00:52:00,615 --> 00:52:04,395
Speaker 9:  And he did not look good on the stand. Google CLO

845
00:52:05,405 --> 00:52:07,115
Speaker 9:  Judge was not buying it. Kent,

846
00:52:07,115 --> 00:52:07,995
Speaker 4:  His name is Kent Walker, by

847
00:52:07,995 --> 00:52:09,355
Speaker 9:  The way. Kent Walker, yes. Kent Walker.

848
00:52:11,715 --> 00:52:14,995
Speaker 9:  Google's Google's attorney who's, who's, sorry, Epic's attorney whose name's

849
00:52:15,195 --> 00:52:19,115
Speaker 9:  escaping me right now. But she was amazing. And, and,

850
00:52:19,175 --> 00:52:22,955
Speaker 9:  and she just, just completely threw him off balance. The

851
00:52:22,965 --> 00:52:26,635
Speaker 9:  judge double teamed Kent Walker with this, with this, this,

852
00:52:26,785 --> 00:52:29,875
Speaker 9:  with this attorney. And like, you know, I don't understand this either. Can

853
00:52:29,875 --> 00:52:33,355
Speaker 9:  you, can you explain those things you just said to me again, Mr. Walker,

854
00:52:34,055 --> 00:52:37,675
Speaker 9:  and, and he wasn't having any of it and he ended the, the judge, judge

855
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:42,115
Speaker 9:  almost one of the penultimate things that Judge Dondo did in the case is

856
00:52:42,115 --> 00:52:45,155
Speaker 9:  he said he's going to personally investigate Google Wow.

857
00:52:46,135 --> 00:52:49,595
Speaker 9:  For deleting all these chats and for, for abusing. What, what

858
00:52:49,595 --> 00:52:53,075
Speaker 9:  1, 1 1 Google Lawyer internally called fake legal

859
00:52:53,185 --> 00:52:57,075
Speaker 9:  privilege. We, we saw a whole bunch of documents during the case

860
00:52:57,075 --> 00:53:00,515
Speaker 9:  that were marked, you know, confidential and privileged. And Google

861
00:53:00,685 --> 00:53:04,075
Speaker 9:  executives, including Sundar Phai, agreed

862
00:53:04,545 --> 00:53:07,875
Speaker 9:  that the only reason some of these things were marked confidential and privileged

863
00:53:08,055 --> 00:53:11,115
Speaker 9:  was so that they wouldn't be forwarded around the company internally and

864
00:53:11,115 --> 00:53:12,515
Speaker 9:  potentially fall into other hands.

865
00:53:12,905 --> 00:53:16,595
Speaker 4:  It's not a good sign when the judge vows to personally

866
00:53:16,875 --> 00:53:19,355
Speaker 4:  investigate your company after the trial is over. Feels bad. So here's what

867
00:53:19,355 --> 00:53:22,395
Speaker 4:  I wanna know, Sean, and then we can, we can dive into some of the merits

868
00:53:22,395 --> 00:53:25,925
Speaker 4:  of the case. This was happening. The judge is furious

869
00:53:26,055 --> 00:53:28,525
Speaker 4:  about this. We, we talked about this a couple weeks ago. We're seeing all

870
00:53:28,525 --> 00:53:32,005
Speaker 4:  these documents. You up wrote a great recap of all the documents, all the

871
00:53:32,005 --> 00:53:35,005
Speaker 4:  deals the judge instructs the jury. Like

872
00:53:35,825 --> 00:53:39,685
Speaker 4:  you can interpret the lack of documentation and the hiding any way you

873
00:53:39,685 --> 00:53:43,605
Speaker 4:  want, which is a big wink wink on how to interpret

874
00:53:43,605 --> 00:53:46,805
Speaker 4:  them. And yet everyone thought Google would win.

875
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:51,935
Speaker 4:  Why? Like, that's the part that does. Why, why was the vibe in the courtroom

876
00:53:51,935 --> 00:53:53,175
Speaker 4:  that Google would win quickly here?

877
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:57,615
Speaker 9:  I think the vibe in the courtroom was that Google would win because

878
00:53:57,915 --> 00:54:01,695
Speaker 9:  of the key question that we always ask in an

879
00:54:01,855 --> 00:54:04,615
Speaker 9:  antitrust trial market definition.

880
00:54:05,695 --> 00:54:09,375
Speaker 9:  Google's been arguing since the very beginning of the case that whatever

881
00:54:09,435 --> 00:54:13,415
Speaker 9:  it did, it was justified because it does all these

882
00:54:13,415 --> 00:54:17,215
Speaker 9:  things to so that Android can compete with the iPhone. And if

883
00:54:17,215 --> 00:54:21,135
Speaker 9:  you say the market definition here is iPhone

884
00:54:21,135 --> 00:54:24,335
Speaker 9:  versus Android, Android is competing with iPhone, consumers are choosing

885
00:54:24,335 --> 00:54:27,015
Speaker 9:  to buy an iPhone versus an Android phone.

886
00:54:29,105 --> 00:54:32,725
Speaker 9:  How is Epic going to say, Hey Google, you have a

887
00:54:32,885 --> 00:54:36,685
Speaker 9:  monopoly on phones. Hey Google, you have a monopoly on apps. Epic

888
00:54:36,705 --> 00:54:40,565
Speaker 9:  wanted everybody to think that Google has a monopoly on Android app

889
00:54:40,885 --> 00:54:44,845
Speaker 9:  distribution very specifically and on Android in app payments where

890
00:54:44,905 --> 00:54:48,845
Speaker 9:  it kind of does, I mean, yes there's a Samsung app store, but

891
00:54:49,675 --> 00:54:53,525
Speaker 9:  Epic convincingly showed that Samsung's app store accounts for barely

892
00:54:53,625 --> 00:54:55,965
Speaker 9:  any download compared to Googles, you know, everybody wants to use Google.

893
00:54:55,995 --> 00:54:56,405
Speaker 9:  Well, and

894
00:54:56,405 --> 00:55:00,165
Speaker 6:  That it's all of that is because of Google's abuse

895
00:55:00,265 --> 00:55:03,645
Speaker 6:  of the system, right? That, that Google has done the work to ensure

896
00:55:04,075 --> 00:55:05,245
Speaker 6:  that Samsung and

897
00:55:05,245 --> 00:55:07,645
Speaker 4:  Others, others can't play nicely. I wanna come, that's the substance of it.

898
00:55:07,765 --> 00:55:11,645
Speaker 4:  I just, for one second, I just wanna sit on why everyone thought Google would

899
00:55:11,645 --> 00:55:15,445
Speaker 4:  win. So I read that, right? Okay. It's market definition.

900
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:18,645
Speaker 4:  Apple just won. Android is technically more open

901
00:55:19,435 --> 00:55:23,365
Speaker 4:  than the iPhone. Even if contractually it is not more open, as we've

902
00:55:23,365 --> 00:55:26,765
Speaker 4:  learned, of course the Google's gonna win, right? The phone's more, more

903
00:55:26,765 --> 00:55:27,405
Speaker 4:  open on its face

904
00:55:27,545 --> 00:55:30,645
Speaker 9:  And in so many ways too. I mean it's, it's, yes you can have your other app

905
00:55:30,645 --> 00:55:34,045
Speaker 9:  store on the phone, but you can also side load apps. Since the very beginning

906
00:55:34,065 --> 00:55:37,685
Speaker 9:  of Android, I was holding up my T-Mobile G one phone and I would download

907
00:55:37,685 --> 00:55:40,765
Speaker 9:  an a PK off the internet and I would put it on there. I don't if any of us

908
00:55:40,765 --> 00:55:44,285
Speaker 9:  immediate get room do that these days. Exactly. I don't know if anybody,

909
00:55:44,705 --> 00:55:47,845
Speaker 9:  any of us do it these days. 'cause so many things are on the play store already

910
00:55:47,865 --> 00:55:51,525
Speaker 9:  and why wouldn't you go there? But like the idea that

911
00:55:52,705 --> 00:55:56,685
Speaker 9:  you can put an app on an on Android phone, so many different ways. You can't

912
00:55:56,685 --> 00:56:00,165
Speaker 9:  put it on the iPhone. How could Google have a monopoly on Android app

913
00:56:00,405 --> 00:56:00,685
Speaker 9:  distribution?

914
00:56:01,145 --> 00:56:04,365
Speaker 4:  The other thing that I think is just sort of reverberating here, and I think

915
00:56:04,365 --> 00:56:07,965
Speaker 4:  we, we all noticed it was the lack of interest in the Google case compared

916
00:56:07,965 --> 00:56:11,765
Speaker 4:  to the Apple case. Like the Apple case was like a star studded, you know,

917
00:56:11,825 --> 00:56:15,525
Speaker 4:  our, our traffic charts are off the charts every single day. Google Verbaled

918
00:56:15,525 --> 00:56:18,085
Speaker 4:  along and Sean, you did a great, like a lot of people covered the Google

919
00:56:18,085 --> 00:56:21,965
Speaker 4:  trial by just following Sean in the story stream. Yep. Which is, you know,

920
00:56:21,965 --> 00:56:24,650
Speaker 4:  great, that's the service we provide. But we could see there was a different

921
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:27,805
Speaker 4:  level of interest. And the thing that I'm honing in on

922
00:56:28,505 --> 00:56:31,885
Speaker 4:  is one, I think everyone assumes that big companies will always win their

923
00:56:31,885 --> 00:56:35,085
Speaker 4:  antitrust cases, which is wrong. And then two,

924
00:56:35,885 --> 00:56:39,325
Speaker 4:  I think people thought it was boring and it appears that the jury did not

925
00:56:39,335 --> 00:56:43,245
Speaker 4:  think it was boring, right? This is like the key thing that everyone missed

926
00:56:43,585 --> 00:56:47,455
Speaker 4:  is the jury was like, oh, this is pretty exciting and interesting and

927
00:56:47,655 --> 00:56:48,255
Speaker 4:  dramatic actually.

928
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:52,175
Speaker 9:  Yeah. Not only was the jury paying attention

929
00:56:52,305 --> 00:56:55,895
Speaker 9:  throughout almost the entire trial, we saw some yawns and

930
00:56:56,085 --> 00:56:59,335
Speaker 9:  like a, when a couple of the expert economists came in and spent a while

931
00:56:59,335 --> 00:57:02,975
Speaker 9:  explaining, you know, basic market theories, there were a few

932
00:57:03,155 --> 00:57:06,335
Speaker 9:  yas, but most of the time they were extremely attentive. They were looking

933
00:57:06,335 --> 00:57:09,535
Speaker 9:  over at the person asking the questions, they were looking over at the witness

934
00:57:09,595 --> 00:57:12,415
Speaker 9:  to see what the answers were. They were looking at the judge, they were looking

935
00:57:12,415 --> 00:57:15,335
Speaker 9:  down at their monitors, looking at all the documents, trying to follow along

936
00:57:15,645 --> 00:57:19,015
Speaker 9:  with some of the slide decks. And they asked

937
00:57:19,415 --> 00:57:23,055
Speaker 9:  questions. Literally today we got to see a few of the

938
00:57:23,375 --> 00:57:27,255
Speaker 9:  questions that the jurors asked during the case. They

939
00:57:27,255 --> 00:57:30,495
Speaker 9:  wrote notes to the judge and said, Hey, can you ask Google

940
00:57:31,235 --> 00:57:35,175
Speaker 9:  how many of the devices are in the RSA 3.0 Premier Tier? Which by

941
00:57:35,175 --> 00:57:39,015
Speaker 9:  the way, is the contract that decides whether A OEM

942
00:57:39,315 --> 00:57:43,215
Speaker 9:  can preload another app store or not onto a phone. So they're like, oh

943
00:57:43,215 --> 00:57:46,255
Speaker 9:  yeah, did, did Google actually keep anybody from doing that? They cared.

944
00:57:46,435 --> 00:57:48,655
Speaker 4:  So now let's get to the substance of it, which is the market.

945
00:57:51,225 --> 00:57:54,665
Speaker 4:  I think everybody thinks the market is iOS versus Android, but here

946
00:57:55,185 --> 00:57:59,145
Speaker 4:  I think what we are really talking about is Google runs Android,

947
00:57:59,145 --> 00:58:02,585
Speaker 4:  it's a platform, it's open, anyone can use it. And there actually

948
00:58:02,925 --> 00:58:06,665
Speaker 4:  is a market for Android app distribution. There are other

949
00:58:06,885 --> 00:58:10,665
Speaker 4:  stores, there are other ways to get Android apps on Android

950
00:58:10,665 --> 00:58:14,185
Speaker 4:  phones. There is not a market for

951
00:58:14,525 --> 00:58:18,465
Speaker 4:  iOS app distribution, which I think was a real problem for Epic. They couldn't

952
00:58:18,465 --> 00:58:21,625
Speaker 4:  argue that Apple was unfairly dominated market 'cause no market existed.

953
00:58:21,935 --> 00:58:25,385
Speaker 6:  Well that's why that one became all about payments, right? That was fundamentally

954
00:58:25,405 --> 00:58:28,105
Speaker 6:  the thing. And like the win that Epic got was the anti steering stuff where

955
00:58:28,285 --> 00:58:31,905
Speaker 6:  you could start to tell Apple users that other ways to pay for things exist.

956
00:58:33,165 --> 00:58:35,585
Speaker 6:  But yeah, in that case, I went back and read a bunch of this and there's

957
00:58:35,585 --> 00:58:38,465
Speaker 6:  so much of it that it's like Apple was able to get away with so much because

958
00:58:39,505 --> 00:58:42,705
Speaker 6:  specifically it is so incredibly locked down and Google,

959
00:58:43,485 --> 00:58:47,265
Speaker 6:  we, we thought Google's relative openness was gonna be a reason. It was harder

960
00:58:47,265 --> 00:58:50,465
Speaker 6:  for Epic to win. And I think it actually went the other way and gave Epic

961
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:54,705
Speaker 6:  like a chance to make a case against Google that you just

962
00:58:54,705 --> 00:58:57,945
Speaker 6:  can't do. 'cause you have to pry open Apple as a company to do it. And that's

963
00:58:57,945 --> 00:58:58,305
Speaker 6:  not gonna work.

964
00:58:58,505 --> 00:58:59,505
Speaker 9:  I think that's absolutely right.

965
00:58:59,685 --> 00:59:03,025
Speaker 5:  We talked about this with the, with the Beeper vs. Stuff in the first segment

966
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:07,585
Speaker 5:  where, where like Apple kind of has an obligation, their whole brand is we

967
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:11,545
Speaker 5:  shut everything down, we lock it down, and it wins them trial after trial.

968
00:59:11,575 --> 00:59:15,065
Speaker 5:  Like if you look at this and say, oh yeah, if the minute

969
00:59:15,565 --> 00:59:18,705
Speaker 5:  Google started saying, well sure we have a monopoly here, but it's

970
00:59:19,095 --> 00:59:22,885
Speaker 5:  Android and we're competing against iPhone, Google was kind of in trouble

971
00:59:23,835 --> 00:59:27,645
Speaker 5:  because that was never the argument the other side made. And they just kind

972
00:59:27,645 --> 00:59:31,335
Speaker 5:  of like, it felt like almost they ignored the argument that Epic

973
00:59:31,435 --> 00:59:34,135
Speaker 5:  was making to be like, no, no, but see we're competing against Apple. And

974
00:59:34,135 --> 00:59:37,375
Speaker 5:  it's like, well why would you make that argument when you really can't bring

975
00:59:37,375 --> 00:59:41,215
Speaker 5:  up Apple that much here? And two, that's not

976
00:59:41,215 --> 00:59:43,455
Speaker 5:  what the people suing you are complaining about.

977
00:59:43,965 --> 00:59:47,695
Speaker 9:  Yeah. So, so, so when I was reporting on this case

978
00:59:47,935 --> 00:59:51,695
Speaker 9:  in the courtroom, what I did not understand until the very

979
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:54,095
Speaker 9:  end, and I don't know if it's always this way, but what I didn't understand

980
00:59:54,095 --> 00:59:57,815
Speaker 9:  until the very end was who is going to decide

981
00:59:58,435 --> 01:00:02,175
Speaker 9:  the market definition and how in a

982
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:05,935
Speaker 9:  jury trial in the Apple case, the judge said, well, you know,

983
01:00:05,965 --> 01:00:09,855
Speaker 9:  Epic, we don't, we don't think it's, it's about, you know,

984
01:00:10,395 --> 01:00:13,855
Speaker 9:  iPhone versus Android. It's gonna be about mobile game transactions because

985
01:00:13,855 --> 01:00:17,455
Speaker 9:  that's what you're actually suing over, right? Vbu and whether

986
01:00:17,505 --> 01:00:20,775
Speaker 9:  where people can buy them and how, and that meant that

987
01:00:21,525 --> 01:00:25,135
Speaker 9:  Epic had to be competing there with other game

988
01:00:25,135 --> 01:00:28,895
Speaker 9:  stores like Nintendo and Sony and Microsoft where it already

989
01:00:28,965 --> 01:00:32,615
Speaker 9:  pays the 30%. So why shouldn't you pay 30% here on Apple too?

990
01:00:33,195 --> 01:00:36,855
Speaker 9:  But in this case, the people who got to decide the market

991
01:00:36,855 --> 01:00:40,775
Speaker 9:  definition were the jurors. They got to write it in on the verdict

992
01:00:40,885 --> 01:00:44,855
Speaker 9:  form themselves, and they were steered by the

993
01:00:44,855 --> 01:00:48,775
Speaker 9:  jury instructions and by a lot of the case towards the idea that

994
01:00:48,775 --> 01:00:51,375
Speaker 9:  it would be Epic's chosen market definition of

995
01:00:52,535 --> 01:00:55,505
Speaker 9:  Android app distribution and in-app

996
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:59,265
Speaker 9:  transactions in-app, mobile payment systems. I mean, and so

997
01:00:59,495 --> 01:01:03,385
Speaker 9:  when they were confronted with that and, and, and the judge was very skeptical

998
01:01:03,485 --> 01:01:07,305
Speaker 9:  of any other theories like Google, sorry, really wanted you to

999
01:01:07,305 --> 01:01:10,945
Speaker 9:  think that this was not only just about Apple versus Android, but also

1000
01:01:11,225 --> 01:01:14,905
Speaker 9:  they had one of their expert economists come under the, under the stand and

1001
01:01:14,905 --> 01:01:18,665
Speaker 9:  suggest it was going to be about the facilitation of mobile transactions.

1002
01:01:19,405 --> 01:01:23,385
Speaker 9:  And the judge was not having that. God, the judge was like,

1003
01:01:24,835 --> 01:01:28,585
Speaker 9:  isn't what you're saying, doesn't that apply to any transaction on the internet?

1004
01:01:29,125 --> 01:01:31,785
Speaker 9:  How does any of that have to do with mobile apps? Specifically?

1005
01:01:32,165 --> 01:01:36,145
Speaker 4:  How do you get a job as an expert economist, you get paid so much money,

1006
01:01:36,145 --> 01:01:39,265
Speaker 4:  just be like, look at this chart. It means whatever who's paying me wants

1007
01:01:39,265 --> 01:01:39,705
Speaker 4:  it to mean

1008
01:01:42,815 --> 01:01:45,825
Speaker 4:  Like, it just seems like such a good and lucrative gig, right? It's like,

1009
01:01:45,825 --> 01:01:46,345
Speaker 4:  yeah, we, we

1010
01:01:46,345 --> 01:01:50,265
Speaker 9:  Heard like $1,600 an hour for this person to be on to be

1011
01:01:50,465 --> 01:01:53,545
Speaker 9:  delivering their, their statements in court. $1,200 an hour Wow. For this

1012
01:01:53,545 --> 01:01:55,225
Speaker 9:  person. And it was funny that the

1013
01:01:55,225 --> 01:01:55,865
Speaker 4:  Chart is all used

1014
01:01:55,875 --> 01:01:59,225
Speaker 9:  World every time it was this back and forth between Epic and Google. Hmm.

1015
01:01:59,385 --> 01:02:03,305
Speaker 9:  I wonder if we can point out how much their expert is making, but let's point

1016
01:02:03,305 --> 01:02:06,585
Speaker 9:  out that they're biased. Bit of a double-edged sword there.

1017
01:02:06,845 --> 01:02:10,735
Speaker 4:  But but just to be clear, the market on

1018
01:02:10,755 --> 01:02:14,615
Speaker 4:  its face because it exists is Android app distribution. It is.

1019
01:02:15,185 --> 01:02:19,015
Speaker 4:  There could have been a better and richer Samsung app store, but Google

1020
01:02:19,115 --> 01:02:23,005
Speaker 4:  paid some money. There was this idea that, what was it?

1021
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:26,765
Speaker 4:  Epic and Valve and a bunch of other companies, Activision,

1022
01:02:26,885 --> 01:02:30,405
Speaker 4:  BL Activision Blizzard would start app stores and

1023
01:02:30,405 --> 01:02:31,805
Speaker 4:  compete against Google. Yeah.

1024
01:02:31,805 --> 01:02:35,605
Speaker 9:  They wanted to build the steam of mobile was to compete against

1025
01:02:35,605 --> 01:02:39,365
Speaker 9:  Valve, but a Epic, Activision Blizzard, I think it was Supercell

1026
01:02:39,385 --> 01:02:41,845
Speaker 9:  was gonna be part of that. They were gonna build a steam of mobile, they

1027
01:02:41,845 --> 01:02:45,725
Speaker 9:  claimed and, and, and put that on Android. And then, you know, you'd,

1028
01:02:45,725 --> 01:02:47,165
Speaker 9:  you'd buy your games there maybe.

1029
01:02:47,545 --> 01:02:50,245
Speaker 4:  And then Google, Google responded this with something called Project Hug,

1030
01:02:50,295 --> 01:02:52,845
Speaker 4:  where it just went and hugged people with money to make them not do it.

1031
01:02:53,905 --> 01:02:57,485
Speaker 4:  That's a smooth move. That's what you want to do. It's a hug. And you're

1032
01:02:57,485 --> 01:02:59,965
Speaker 4:  like, is that getting a be Is it a weird little, oh no, it's just cash.

1033
01:03:00,715 --> 01:03:03,965
Speaker 9:  Well, they hugged him and then Pocket maybe the jury would, would, would,

1034
01:03:03,965 --> 01:03:07,205
Speaker 9:  would get that. It wasn't exactly a bribe because it's, it's, it's all like

1035
01:03:07,205 --> 01:03:11,085
Speaker 9:  these co-marketing arrangements here. We'll give you some Google ad credits

1036
01:03:11,425 --> 01:03:15,365
Speaker 9:  and here here's some revenue sharing over here. And here's, you know, the

1037
01:03:15,365 --> 01:03:19,285
Speaker 9:  only, the only company that I think Google directly paid it was

1038
01:03:19,285 --> 01:03:22,605
Speaker 9:  like, here's money for doing the thing. It's just a bribe is Motorola and

1039
01:03:22,805 --> 01:03:26,485
Speaker 9:  lg. But yes, I mean it all comes down to it's harder for anybody else

1040
01:03:27,145 --> 01:03:30,525
Speaker 9:  to build the thing because Google is paying someone. It's a bad bribe. but

1041
01:03:31,025 --> 01:03:31,245
Speaker 9:  it

1042
01:03:31,245 --> 01:03:34,485
Speaker 6:  Does come back. And this is why I think the, the fact that it's a jury trial

1043
01:03:34,545 --> 01:03:37,445
Speaker 6:  is so fascinating because it's like, there's a series of things in here,

1044
01:03:37,445 --> 01:03:40,765
Speaker 6:  right? And I think Project Hug, which you just described, and then the Spotify

1045
01:03:40,955 --> 01:03:44,845
Speaker 6:  deal that Google gave Spotify where it essentially doesn't,

1046
01:03:45,085 --> 01:03:47,405
Speaker 6:  actually, can you just explain that really fast? 'cause I, I confess, I got

1047
01:03:47,405 --> 01:03:50,845
Speaker 6:  hung up on like what the numbers are about here, but essentially Spotify

1048
01:03:51,985 --> 01:03:55,325
Speaker 6:  got a sneaky deal from Google where it essentially didn't have to pay anything

1049
01:03:55,325 --> 01:03:56,325
Speaker 6:  to be in the Play store. Right?

1050
01:03:56,945 --> 01:04:00,645
Speaker 9:  That's, that's it. I mean, okay, Spotify, okay. Normally

1051
01:04:01,025 --> 01:04:05,005
Speaker 9:  an app developer pays what, 30% to be on the play store.

1052
01:04:05,155 --> 01:04:09,045
Speaker 9:  They pay 15% for their first year or something like that.

1053
01:04:09,805 --> 01:04:13,325
Speaker 9:  If it's, and then it's, and then there's a 15% for subscriptions. There's

1054
01:04:13,325 --> 01:04:17,045
Speaker 9:  a bunch of ways that Google discounts the rate, but some app developers said,

1055
01:04:17,425 --> 01:04:21,285
Speaker 9:  we wanna have our own payment system. And Google first said, no,

1056
01:04:21,285 --> 01:04:24,325
Speaker 9:  you're not gonna have your own payment system. And then they said, well maybe

1057
01:04:24,455 --> 01:04:28,165
Speaker 9:  we'll do this experimental trial thing where some companies get their own

1058
01:04:28,165 --> 01:04:32,085
Speaker 9:  payment system and we'll give you a 4% discount. And

1059
01:04:32,085 --> 01:04:36,005
Speaker 9:  they called it something Choice billing. So if

1060
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:39,885
Speaker 9:  you, if you were on the choice billing, you'd have, Spotify would theoretically

1061
01:04:40,195 --> 01:04:44,085
Speaker 9:  have one system where it pays its 15% to Google

1062
01:04:44,145 --> 01:04:48,125
Speaker 9:  for subscriptions, or it's 30% for one time purchases, if that's

1063
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:51,965
Speaker 9:  a thing on Spotify anymore. And then on the on, on, if it

1064
01:04:51,965 --> 01:04:55,485
Speaker 9:  wants, if Spotify wants to use its own payment system, we get a 4% discount

1065
01:04:55,485 --> 01:04:57,445
Speaker 9:  on that. So 11%, which

1066
01:04:57,445 --> 01:05:00,965
Speaker 6:  Is nothing. And like this came up a bunch, right, that like by the time you

1067
01:05:00,965 --> 01:05:03,885
Speaker 6:  pay another payment processor, you're gonna be back at 15%. So you might

1068
01:05:03,885 --> 01:05:06,605
Speaker 6:  as well just give Google because it's simpler. So like that's not a deal

1069
01:05:06,625 --> 01:05:07,205
Speaker 6:  at over 50

1070
01:05:07,205 --> 01:05:10,205
Speaker 9:  Google calculated, you'd be paying more than that 4%. Yeah. Okay. To get

1071
01:05:10,205 --> 01:05:13,445
Speaker 9:  your own payment system, they thought it wasn't even gonna be a choice. So

1072
01:05:13,445 --> 01:05:13,565
Speaker 9:  it's,

1073
01:05:14,195 --> 01:05:14,645
Speaker 6:  It's a fake deal.

1074
01:05:14,815 --> 01:05:18,765
Speaker 9:  Money that completely fake. Okay. But what we learned is Google SE

1075
01:05:18,765 --> 01:05:21,885
Speaker 9:  or Spotify secretly had an arrangement to pay not

1076
01:05:21,885 --> 01:05:25,765
Speaker 9:  11%, but 0% when it used its own

1077
01:05:25,765 --> 01:05:26,605
Speaker 6:  Bill, which is a deal.

1078
01:05:27,375 --> 01:05:31,235
Speaker 9:  And that's, that's quite a deal. But, but Google isn't offering that to anyone

1079
01:05:31,235 --> 01:05:34,035
Speaker 9:  else that we're aware of. Google also said, Hey Netflix,

1080
01:05:35,035 --> 01:05:38,915
Speaker 9:  you don't wanna pay 30% anymore or 15% anymore. You can pay 10%, you wanna

1081
01:05:38,915 --> 01:05:42,715
Speaker 9:  pay 10%. Netflix said no. Yeah, we're gonna just bypass the

1082
01:05:42,715 --> 01:05:45,915
Speaker 9:  store. We're not gonna let you buy thing, buy your subscription to Netflix

1083
01:05:45,915 --> 01:05:48,515
Speaker 9:  through Android, you'll go buy it on the web, you'll buy it somewhere else.

1084
01:05:48,895 --> 01:05:50,875
Speaker 9:  We know you'll find it elsewhere. That's

1085
01:05:50,875 --> 01:05:54,755
Speaker 4:  Like when one monopoly hits another monopoly, like Netflix is like,

1086
01:05:54,755 --> 01:05:56,875
Speaker 4:  what are you gonna do? Not have Netflix? Yeah.

1087
01:05:58,865 --> 01:06:01,875
Speaker 4:  Like, hey, we don't, we're not paying you money to sign up for Netflix.

1088
01:06:02,895 --> 01:06:04,395
Speaker 4:  No, you'll just have it at birth. I

1089
01:06:04,395 --> 01:06:07,755
Speaker 9:  Love that's Netflix's approach constantly. Here's my question. That is also

1090
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:10,555
Speaker 9:  what Spotify said. What are you gonna do? Just not have Spotify? Yeah. And

1091
01:06:10,555 --> 01:06:14,515
Speaker 9:  Google said, okay, you can pay nothing. And at what point,

1092
01:06:14,815 --> 01:06:18,635
Speaker 9:  at what point Google said they were gonna do this to us if we didn't give

1093
01:06:18,755 --> 01:06:22,035
Speaker 9:  'em a deal, I didn't realize at that point that it was a 0% deal. I thought

1094
01:06:22,035 --> 01:06:25,995
Speaker 9:  it was, you know, maybe they get 6% or something, 0%. What do

1095
01:06:25,995 --> 01:06:28,555
Speaker 9:  you do at that point? If you're Google, do you say,

1096
01:06:30,295 --> 01:06:34,105
Speaker 9:  okay, you get the special deal. Do you say let's treat

1097
01:06:34,105 --> 01:06:37,825
Speaker 9:  everybody fairly like we, we pretend we're gonna do and and and you know,

1098
01:06:37,825 --> 01:06:40,905
Speaker 9:  make that real and just give everybody the 0%. What do you

1099
01:06:40,905 --> 01:06:44,265
Speaker 4:  Think? So Google has to make the deal because there's the other, there's

1100
01:06:44,265 --> 01:06:48,185
Speaker 4:  the out right? Apple just says we're gonna not have

1101
01:06:48,185 --> 01:06:52,025
Speaker 4:  Netflix, which is fascinating, like

1102
01:06:52,155 --> 01:06:56,105
Speaker 4:  their view. And it is played out in different ways for Apple in different

1103
01:06:56,545 --> 01:06:59,745
Speaker 4:  platforms. So on the iPhone they're like, we just wanna have Netflix and

1104
01:06:59,855 --> 01:07:03,665
Speaker 4:  everybody caves. Like the idea of not having your app on the iPhone

1105
01:07:03,875 --> 01:07:07,685
Speaker 4:  completely outta bounds. Apple tries to pull the stuff with

1106
01:07:07,905 --> 01:07:11,885
Speaker 4:  the TV app on the Apple TV and Netflix is like, no,

1107
01:07:11,895 --> 01:07:14,605
Speaker 4:  we're just, we're no, what are you gonna do? Not have Netflix. But at the

1108
01:07:14,605 --> 01:07:17,045
Speaker 4:  same time, and Apple's like, okay, you don't have to put your Apple tv,

1109
01:07:17,045 --> 01:07:20,205
Speaker 6:  Can you sign up on Netflix through in-app purchases? I don't think so. Netflix,

1110
01:07:20,235 --> 01:07:23,965
Speaker 6:  Netflix has held pretty fast on that stuff. Yeah. And, and there's, but the

1111
01:07:23,965 --> 01:07:27,365
Speaker 6:  thing is, there's only a handful of companies that can get away with that,

1112
01:07:27,365 --> 01:07:31,325
Speaker 6:  right? Like I'm actually surprised, yeah, Spotify rises to that level

1113
01:07:31,545 --> 01:07:35,085
Speaker 6:  for Google or anybody. But like I think if I'm Google my worry is like, okay,

1114
01:07:35,155 --> 01:07:38,365
Speaker 6:  Spotify's not in the play store. Spotify's gonna be in the Galaxy store.

1115
01:07:38,365 --> 01:07:41,045
Speaker 6:  And you know what, like a hell of a lot of people might do to get Spotify

1116
01:07:41,105 --> 01:07:42,765
Speaker 6:  on their phones is open the Galaxy store.

1117
01:07:42,765 --> 01:07:45,325
Speaker 4:  That's what I mean, there's a market there, right? They have an out, they

1118
01:07:45,645 --> 01:07:49,565
Speaker 4:  can go and say open this other app store, right? We we're gonna partner with

1119
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:53,485
Speaker 4:  Samsung directly and preload Netflix on the phone in

1120
01:07:53,485 --> 01:07:57,405
Speaker 4:  a way that Apple's just like, no, no other choices shall exist. And

1121
01:07:57,755 --> 01:08:01,485
Speaker 4:  Sean you interviewed Tim Sweeney right after the trial and I thought this

1122
01:08:01,485 --> 01:08:05,365
Speaker 4:  was the most important thing that he said. He said, I

1123
01:08:05,395 --> 01:08:09,285
Speaker 4:  wish Apple wasn't so like clear cut on what you can't

1124
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:13,085
Speaker 4:  do. And I think the exact words he used were Thou shalt not have another

1125
01:08:13,185 --> 01:08:16,765
Speaker 4:  app store. Yeah. And it's like, oh that's the, that's why you lost

1126
01:08:16,765 --> 01:08:20,325
Speaker 4:  against Apple because there wasn't even the possibility

1127
01:08:20,825 --> 01:08:24,005
Speaker 4:  for Apple to unfairly foreclose, right? Like

1128
01:08:24,405 --> 01:08:27,525
Speaker 4:  Google's like, oh, there's all these outs they can take. It might result

1129
01:08:27,525 --> 01:08:30,445
Speaker 4:  in some fragmentation. You can assign noble intentions to Google here, by

1130
01:08:30,445 --> 01:08:34,245
Speaker 4:  the way, you can say Android had a big fragmentation problem. You

1131
01:08:34,245 --> 01:08:37,045
Speaker 4:  don't want all these different ways to get apps, especially the big apps.

1132
01:08:37,395 --> 01:08:41,165
Speaker 4:  Like if you go get a new phone and to get Spotify and

1133
01:08:41,165 --> 01:08:45,005
Speaker 4:  Netflix and TikTok, you need to download three different app stores.

1134
01:08:45,395 --> 01:08:48,285
Speaker 4:  This is a bad outcome. Yes. For Google, it's a bad outcome for users. I think

1135
01:08:48,285 --> 01:08:52,205
Speaker 9:  It's important to remember that we at The Verge spent several years

1136
01:08:52,755 --> 01:08:56,605
Speaker 9:  writing reviews of Android phones where we were like, I wish this just had

1137
01:08:56,635 --> 01:08:59,885
Speaker 9:  pure stock Android on it. Instead of layers of blood

1138
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:01,645
Speaker 4:  Bone stock, I believe bone

1139
01:09:01,695 --> 01:09:05,445
Speaker 9:  Stock. That's right, that's right. Like, I want that from my phone.

1140
01:09:05,805 --> 01:09:09,485
Speaker 9:  Motorola testified on the stand that it helped them cell phones.

1141
01:09:09,955 --> 01:09:13,365
Speaker 9:  Like I get why Google wants to crack down in fragmentation. We've written

1142
01:09:13,385 --> 01:09:17,285
Speaker 9:  the editorial eight times here at The Verge and these contracts

1143
01:09:17,285 --> 01:09:20,805
Speaker 9:  are how it does that. But these contracts have also helped them make

1144
01:09:21,545 --> 01:09:25,125
Speaker 9:  the Google Play Store a profit center for the entire company that makes

1145
01:09:25,135 --> 01:09:28,765
Speaker 9:  ridiculous billions in revenue would be a Fortune 100

1146
01:09:28,965 --> 01:09:32,805
Speaker 9:  company all by itself and has a 72% or something like that

1147
01:09:33,165 --> 01:09:33,805
Speaker 9:  profit March.

1148
01:09:34,515 --> 01:09:38,445
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And one by the way, one way you could cut down in fragmentation is

1149
01:09:38,665 --> 01:09:42,205
Speaker 4:  by being more competitive, right? Like, this is actually like really

1150
01:09:42,405 --> 01:09:43,245
Speaker 6:  Interesting. Make better phones. Google

1151
01:09:43,745 --> 01:09:47,205
Speaker 4:  You, right? You could make a better phone. You could, you could make the

1152
01:09:47,205 --> 01:09:50,165
Speaker 4:  Pixel really competitive. Like there's a million ways to do it. And Google

1153
01:09:50,175 --> 01:09:53,925
Speaker 4:  chose to do it by taking a bunch of money, firing it into the market

1154
01:09:54,145 --> 01:09:57,605
Speaker 4:  and making sure that no other competitors existed. Which by the way, David

1155
01:09:57,785 --> 01:10:01,645
Speaker 4:  did come back to DOJ versus Google is exactly what they do in the

1156
01:10:01,645 --> 01:10:04,765
Speaker 4:  search market. And I don know how that case is gonna go. But the parallels

1157
01:10:04,765 --> 01:10:05,605
Speaker 4:  are right there. The

1158
01:10:05,805 --> 01:10:09,245
Speaker 6:  Parallels are right there. And I think the difference, like back to the thou

1159
01:10:09,255 --> 01:10:12,925
Speaker 6:  shalt not thing like you, you can accuse Apple of many things, but you cannot

1160
01:10:13,025 --> 01:10:16,685
Speaker 6:  accuse Apple of being inconsistent, right? Like, it, it is,

1161
01:10:17,025 --> 01:10:20,965
Speaker 6:  it, it has been what it has been for a very long time and you can dislike

1162
01:10:20,965 --> 01:10:24,765
Speaker 6:  it, but I think one of the reasons Apple keeps winning is because it just

1163
01:10:24,885 --> 01:10:28,565
Speaker 6:  keeps saying the same thing and it's not unclear about what you are signing

1164
01:10:28,565 --> 01:10:32,165
Speaker 6:  up for when you buy an iPhone. And when that

1165
01:10:32,165 --> 01:10:35,805
Speaker 6:  happens, it might be different. Google on the other hand, I think

1166
01:10:36,585 --> 01:10:39,725
Speaker 6:  the sketchiness of all of these deals I think really worked against Google,

1167
01:10:39,725 --> 01:10:43,605
Speaker 6:  especially in a jury case where like you can, you can sort of

1168
01:10:43,605 --> 01:10:47,445
Speaker 6:  talk yourself into some of these being like reasonable things that

1169
01:10:47,445 --> 01:10:50,645
Speaker 6:  reasonable businesses do, but like there's no question that they just feel

1170
01:10:50,895 --> 01:10:54,765
Speaker 6:  gross. And I think to, to a jury especially over time, and I

1171
01:10:54,765 --> 01:10:57,445
Speaker 6:  wonder how it felt even just sitting in the courtroom, like my sense was

1172
01:10:57,715 --> 01:11:01,365
Speaker 6:  even just like following your stuff in the story stream Sean, like you kind

1173
01:11:01,605 --> 01:11:05,485
Speaker 6:  of got more and more of like an ick over the course of

1174
01:11:05,485 --> 01:11:08,565
Speaker 6:  the trial watching all of this go down and you just go from thinking like,

1175
01:11:08,565 --> 01:11:11,845
Speaker 6:  oh, Google is a company that makes deals to insured to just being like, this

1176
01:11:11,845 --> 01:11:15,485
Speaker 6:  just sucks. And I think, like I get the sense everybody sort of felt that

1177
01:11:15,485 --> 01:11:16,525
Speaker 6:  over the course of four weeks.

1178
01:11:16,995 --> 01:11:20,965
Speaker 9:  Yeah. I think I maybe I, maybe I was a bit of a proxy for, for helping

1179
01:11:21,265 --> 01:11:24,965
Speaker 9:  our readers live vicariously in the, in the position of the jurors so they

1180
01:11:24,965 --> 01:11:28,005
Speaker 9:  could see it kind of like that. If you were in the courtroom, would you feel

1181
01:11:28,005 --> 01:11:31,965
Speaker 9:  the same way if you were one of the people on the nine jurors making

1182
01:11:31,965 --> 01:11:35,205
Speaker 9:  these decisions? I do wanna challenge what you said earlier about Apple being

1183
01:11:35,205 --> 01:11:39,045
Speaker 9:  consistent. It has been compared to Google incredibly

1184
01:11:39,055 --> 01:11:39,725
Speaker 9:  consistent.

1185
01:11:40,195 --> 01:11:40,485
Speaker 4:  Sure.

1186
01:11:40,625 --> 01:11:44,525
Speaker 9:  But Apple made sweetheart deals over private email too. I mean

1187
01:11:44,525 --> 01:11:48,485
Speaker 9:  that fair. Netflix had a unique relationship with Apple to do a 15%

1188
01:11:48,485 --> 01:11:52,085
Speaker 9:  revenue share, which was not enough for Netflix. And Netflix eventually did

1189
01:11:52,085 --> 01:11:55,925
Speaker 9:  go its own way, but they did try and

1190
01:11:55,925 --> 01:11:59,205
Speaker 9:  broker that similar kind of arrangement. Yeah, that's true. There were a

1191
01:11:59,205 --> 01:12:01,285
Speaker 9:  number of things like that that we saw back in the day,

1192
01:12:01,345 --> 01:12:04,005
Speaker 5:  But not at this trial. Because you weren't allowed to talk about Apple at

1193
01:12:04,005 --> 01:12:04,765
Speaker 5:  the trial for the most part.

1194
01:12:05,435 --> 01:12:06,605
Speaker 9:  Exactly. Yeah,

1195
01:12:06,605 --> 01:12:08,925
Speaker 4:  We had another trial. Alex you're gonna say something? No,

1196
01:12:08,925 --> 01:12:12,805
Speaker 5:  No, I think mine was just an anecdote because when, when I was, I was

1197
01:12:12,805 --> 01:12:16,605
Speaker 5:  like reading all of your coverage Sean and a, a friend of the family is a

1198
01:12:16,605 --> 01:12:20,565
Speaker 5:  former judge, and I'd be like, okay, I have a question for you as a former

1199
01:12:20,655 --> 01:12:24,565
Speaker 5:  judge, if someone has been going out of their way

1200
01:12:24,585 --> 01:12:28,325
Speaker 5:  to like hide a lot of documents and stuff to the point that it keeps

1201
01:12:28,325 --> 01:12:29,245
Speaker 5:  coming up in trial,

1202
01:12:30,945 --> 01:12:34,805
Speaker 5:  how would that case probably go for them? And, and that friend was like,

1203
01:12:36,235 --> 01:12:38,415
Speaker 5:  not, well, just as a judge,

1204
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:42,815
Speaker 5:  Don't do that. And then I was like, and then there was also a bunch of proof

1205
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:46,455
Speaker 5:  that they were doing these sweetheart deals and like other people do it,

1206
01:12:46,475 --> 01:12:50,335
Speaker 5:  but they were doing it and they're like, no, you're kind of boned in that

1207
01:12:50,445 --> 01:12:53,935
Speaker 5:  respect. They used more polite terminology there, but they were very much

1208
01:12:53,935 --> 01:12:57,775
Speaker 5:  like, oh, like, like it was, I think for anybody who wasn't

1209
01:12:57,925 --> 01:13:01,615
Speaker 5:  kind of in that tech space and had seen the Apple case, but it has like any

1210
01:13:01,615 --> 01:13:05,335
Speaker 5:  kind of grasp of this stuff. It was just like, oh no, you Google was, was

1211
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:09,215
Speaker 5:  gonna get wrecked. Like yeah, you can't piss the judge off that much and

1212
01:13:09,215 --> 01:13:11,295
Speaker 5:  expect to, to win generally.

1213
01:13:11,805 --> 01:13:14,375
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Where, where the judge is like, I will personally investigate you.

1214
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:19,215
Speaker 4:  That was a long night for Google's lawyers. Like they, a lot of Macallan

1215
01:13:19,235 --> 01:13:22,975
Speaker 4:  was consumed. That's what I, that's what I think Google's lawyer strength.

1216
01:13:24,555 --> 01:13:28,335
Speaker 4:  Two things that I want to bring up. One Alex, to your point, I think having

1217
01:13:28,435 --> 01:13:31,135
Speaker 4:  the jury, you know, there's that phrase like you don't wanna know how the

1218
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:33,495
Speaker 4:  sausage is made. And I think a lot of judges are like, oh, that's some sausage.

1219
01:13:33,845 --> 01:13:37,815
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And the jury is like, this is gross. Like I'm never eating a hot

1220
01:13:37,815 --> 01:13:41,215
Speaker 4:  dog again. Right? Like I think there's just that element of it. And then

1221
01:13:41,455 --> 01:13:44,895
Speaker 4:  I think, and this Shauna, I kind of want to bring this

1222
01:13:45,415 --> 01:13:48,855
Speaker 4:  together and, and wrap this up a little bit. There's just

1223
01:13:49,195 --> 01:13:52,775
Speaker 4:  the element that all business works like this.

1224
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:57,375
Speaker 4:  And if you just like see how it happens, like maybe that's bad,

1225
01:13:58,185 --> 01:14:01,695
Speaker 4:  right? Like Google's an advertising company in a

1226
01:14:01,995 --> 01:14:05,935
Speaker 4:  do a lot of deals and they're really good at making sharky deals. And

1227
01:14:05,935 --> 01:14:09,695
Speaker 4:  that version of Google is very different than the version of Google. That's

1228
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:13,605
Speaker 4:  like the new Google doodle is in different colors today, right? Like they,

1229
01:14:13,675 --> 01:14:17,605
Speaker 4:  they maintain that quirky silly image and then the back end of

1230
01:14:17,605 --> 01:14:21,365
Speaker 4:  Google is a Sharky advertising company. And

1231
01:14:21,365 --> 01:14:25,005
Speaker 4:  when you see it, it's like really bad. And there was one moment

1232
01:14:25,635 --> 01:14:29,605
Speaker 4:  that I still think is the most fascinating where Tim Sweeney and

1233
01:14:29,605 --> 01:14:33,525
Speaker 4:  Sun re met for settlement and they couldn't get there. And you

1234
01:14:33,525 --> 01:14:36,325
Speaker 4:  talked to Tim about it and he wouldn't tell you about it with the, about

1235
01:14:36,325 --> 01:14:40,165
Speaker 4:  the specifics, but it seemed like Google tried to make another

1236
01:14:40,165 --> 01:14:41,765
Speaker 4:  deal at the last minute. And Tim said, no,

1237
01:14:42,225 --> 01:14:45,805
Speaker 9:  That's what, that's certainly what Tim Sweeney was

1238
01:14:45,925 --> 01:14:49,685
Speaker 9:  implying. He, he certainly implied that Sundar tried to

1239
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:53,565
Speaker 9:  offer me personally something again, and, and frankly to, to

1240
01:14:53,565 --> 01:14:56,325
Speaker 9:  your point about like maybe this is just how the sausage is made, business

1241
01:14:56,325 --> 01:15:00,085
Speaker 9:  deals happen like this. The judge also

1242
01:15:00,085 --> 01:15:03,645
Speaker 9:  thought that Epic might take its own deal in the

1243
01:15:03,645 --> 01:15:07,485
Speaker 9:  courtroom after the jury had gone home for the day. Judge

1244
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:11,245
Speaker 9:  Donato was like, Hey Epic, Google,

1245
01:15:11,675 --> 01:15:15,485
Speaker 9:  have you tried settling yet? And when Epic's attorney, lead attorney

1246
01:15:15,635 --> 01:15:19,565
Speaker 9:  said, no, we haven't actually really tried that yet. And

1247
01:15:19,565 --> 01:15:23,365
Speaker 9:  he was like, what are you asking for? And Epic went off on some

1248
01:15:23,365 --> 01:15:27,245
Speaker 9:  like, we want this for us and all developers. And the judge came back with,

1249
01:15:27,915 --> 01:15:31,805
Speaker 9:  well, Spotify got this special deal for itself. I'm sure you could get

1250
01:15:31,805 --> 01:15:35,765
Speaker 9:  that special deal for yourselves too. Go talk about it. And so

1251
01:15:35,765 --> 01:15:38,965
Speaker 9:  the judge was under the implication by wait, that this wasn't gonna be a

1252
01:15:38,965 --> 01:15:42,565
Speaker 9:  blank thing for all developers. Maybe Epic should go get a special deal for

1253
01:15:42,565 --> 01:15:42,965
Speaker 9:  itself.

1254
01:15:43,315 --> 01:15:46,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah. By the way, most cases settle, this is a thing we should note, like

1255
01:15:46,605 --> 01:15:49,925
Speaker 4:  70 or 80% of cases settle and judges want the cases to settle,

1256
01:15:50,375 --> 01:15:54,205
Speaker 4:  right? The idea is that the American legal system should not resolve conflicts

1257
01:15:54,205 --> 01:15:57,525
Speaker 4:  between two rap priorities themselves. You should go work it out and that's

1258
01:15:57,525 --> 01:16:01,365
Speaker 4:  fine. So, I, I think the judge has to say that, but like the

1259
01:16:01,365 --> 01:16:04,685
Speaker 4:  idea that he asked Epic, what do you want? And Epic responded with some

1260
01:16:05,935 --> 01:16:09,745
Speaker 4:  potentially self-serving I but yet very idealistic creed perfectly

1261
01:16:09,745 --> 01:16:10,545
Speaker 4:  in character for Epic.

1262
01:16:10,545 --> 01:16:11,025
Speaker 6:  Well, and that's

1263
01:16:11,105 --> 01:16:11,985
Speaker 4:  Actually totally in character.

1264
01:16:12,055 --> 01:16:15,705
Speaker 6:  That was the other thing I was wondering, Sean is for what,

1265
01:16:15,915 --> 01:16:19,345
Speaker 6:  three years now? Tim Sweeney has been trying to kind of white knight his

1266
01:16:19,345 --> 01:16:22,825
Speaker 6:  way through all of these processes. Like he really

1267
01:16:23,555 --> 01:16:27,465
Speaker 6:  wants to be seen and have Epic be seen as the good

1268
01:16:27,465 --> 01:16:30,065
Speaker 6:  guy here, right? And he even said to you, he's like, we would never take

1269
01:16:30,065 --> 01:16:32,505
Speaker 6:  a deal. We're doing this for all developers. We've always done this for all

1270
01:16:32,505 --> 01:16:34,865
Speaker 6:  developers. Even when Google offered us a deal, we said, no, we wanna do

1271
01:16:34,865 --> 01:16:38,025
Speaker 6:  it for all developers. He like dug up an email that they offered the deal

1272
01:16:38,025 --> 01:16:41,905
Speaker 6:  that he didn't want. Like, but then he sits on

1273
01:16:41,905 --> 01:16:44,705
Speaker 6:  the stand and is like, yes, if this happens, we're probably gonna make billions

1274
01:16:44,705 --> 01:16:45,105
Speaker 6:  of dollars.

1275
01:16:45,945 --> 01:16:48,585
Speaker 9:  Okay. So little story about that, little story about that.

1276
01:16:49,825 --> 01:16:53,585
Speaker 9:  I thought, I thought that maybe Tim Sweeney is

1277
01:16:53,585 --> 01:16:56,385
Speaker 9:  just that kind of personality where

1278
01:16:57,485 --> 01:17:01,145
Speaker 9:  he walks up there and he doesn't necessarily know what he's saying

1279
01:17:01,445 --> 01:17:05,425
Speaker 9:  is, is truthful, but maybe not the best thing

1280
01:17:05,425 --> 01:17:09,365
Speaker 9:  to be seen publicly saying maybe, maybe this just kind of

1281
01:17:09,435 --> 01:17:11,525
Speaker 9:  came out of him. But then after

1282
01:17:11,525 --> 01:17:12,605
Speaker 6:  He's testifying on vibes,

1283
01:17:13,015 --> 01:17:16,885
Speaker 9:  Maybe Maybe it just came out of him that he's laughing about how he could

1284
01:17:16,885 --> 01:17:20,605
Speaker 9:  make billions of dollars by paying Google nothing. But No,

1285
01:17:21,265 --> 01:17:24,605
Speaker 9:  but no, I, I ran into him later in the hallway. I think it was the next day.

1286
01:17:24,845 --> 01:17:27,565
Speaker 9:  'cause by the way, he's been there every single day of the trail. Save one.

1287
01:17:29,045 --> 01:17:32,925
Speaker 9:  I ran him to the next day and he, and he, and he walks up to me and he says,

1288
01:17:33,585 --> 01:17:37,435
Speaker 9:  you got the number of exclamation points, right? Oh,

1289
01:17:37,675 --> 01:17:40,915
Speaker 9:  and he's referring to this post where he's laughing about making billions

1290
01:17:40,915 --> 01:17:41,795
Speaker 9:  of dollars off of Google.

1291
01:17:43,115 --> 01:17:43,355
Speaker 6:  Interesting.

1292
01:17:43,735 --> 01:17:44,955
Speaker 4:  How many exclamation points was it?

1293
01:17:44,985 --> 01:17:48,075
Speaker 9:  Just one actually, but one, one for that phrase. Well, there was

1294
01:17:48,075 --> 01:17:48,315
Speaker 6:  Another one,

1295
01:17:48,665 --> 01:17:51,515
Speaker 9:  Another sentence. Awesome. It's awesome that he could avoid paying Google

1296
01:17:51,835 --> 01:17:54,435
Speaker 9:  anything. So one, one there and then one for the, the billions of dollars,

1297
01:17:54,535 --> 01:17:55,715
Speaker 9:  two exclamation points total.

1298
01:17:56,335 --> 01:17:59,715
Speaker 6:  So is is Tim Sweeney still the white Knight for all developers everywhere?

1299
01:17:59,715 --> 01:18:03,635
Speaker 6:  Like as at the end of this, if as they appear to be winning this fight, which

1300
01:18:03,745 --> 01:18:07,115
Speaker 6:  will get appealed and God only knows, but like, does he still seem like the

1301
01:18:07,275 --> 01:18:10,475
Speaker 6:  champion of all developers or did he just like lie in his pockets and laugh

1302
01:18:10,475 --> 01:18:11,115
Speaker 6:  all the way to the bank?

1303
01:18:11,815 --> 01:18:15,715
Speaker 9:  God don don't know. I I I feel like a question in

1304
01:18:15,715 --> 01:18:19,435
Speaker 9:  the back of my mind for, for the three years now has been,

1305
01:18:20,065 --> 01:18:23,915
Speaker 9:  does he actually think he'll ever win any of these lawsuits

1306
01:18:24,095 --> 01:18:27,955
Speaker 9:  all the way through appeal? Or is he doing this to grossly

1307
01:18:28,185 --> 01:18:31,475
Speaker 9:  embarrass Google and Apple because all of these

1308
01:18:32,235 --> 01:18:35,755
Speaker 9:  documents and contracts are coming out and because he's decided he wants

1309
01:18:35,755 --> 01:18:39,635
Speaker 9:  to personally make his company's wealth go towards this,

1310
01:18:39,945 --> 01:18:40,595
Speaker 9:  this effort,

1311
01:18:41,315 --> 01:18:44,185
Speaker 6:  Which by all accounts would not be out of character for Tim Sweeney. Like

1312
01:18:44,185 --> 01:18:47,745
Speaker 6:  I've, I've never met the man, but everything people who know him say makes

1313
01:18:47,745 --> 01:18:49,865
Speaker 6:  that seem like a perfectly plausible explanation.

1314
01:18:50,585 --> 01:18:50,865
Speaker 9:  Absolutely.

1315
01:18:51,455 --> 01:18:54,305
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like a very funny Tim Sweeney fact is a,

1316
01:18:55,335 --> 01:18:58,155
Speaker 4:  you know, we, we have like lots of ideas, but on the record and off the record

1317
01:18:58,155 --> 01:19:02,065
Speaker 4:  and background, Tim Sweeney only talks on the record. That's just

1318
01:19:02,205 --> 01:19:05,385
Speaker 4:  the thing. He just like won't, he won't even entertain the idea that he should

1319
01:19:05,385 --> 01:19:08,145
Speaker 4:  talk to you in the background. That's him coming to us. That's usually the

1320
01:19:08,145 --> 01:19:11,785
Speaker 4:  other way around. And I know people have like lots of issues with him as

1321
01:19:11,785 --> 01:19:15,505
Speaker 4:  a personality and like what Steam does and whether not Steam. I know people

1322
01:19:15,505 --> 01:19:18,625
Speaker 4:  have like a lot of issues with Epic and what Epic does and whether Epic is

1323
01:19:18,625 --> 01:19:22,185
Speaker 4:  ruthless on the PC and they're buying exclusives from the Steam, like whatever.

1324
01:19:23,445 --> 01:19:27,385
Speaker 4:  But I, I do think there's an idealism there. Like it's, it's actually like

1325
01:19:27,425 --> 01:19:31,075
Speaker 4:  a really interesting thing for a company of, of Epic

1326
01:19:31,145 --> 01:19:35,115
Speaker 4:  size to be idealistic or to have a CEO who's idealistic. Like

1327
01:19:35,345 --> 01:19:38,995
Speaker 4:  most CEOs are like, soon Reper try offered me billions of dollars to

1328
01:19:38,995 --> 01:19:42,755
Speaker 9:  Go. He even tried to be idealistic about the billions of dollars thing.

1329
01:19:42,955 --> 01:19:46,835
Speaker 9:  I mean the very next thing that happened was in that

1330
01:19:46,835 --> 01:19:49,235
Speaker 9:  moment he said, I think it would be billions of dollars. It'd be awesome

1331
01:19:49,255 --> 01:19:53,155
Speaker 9:  if I could avoid paying Google anything. Google was very satisfied with

1332
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:57,035
Speaker 9:  that. And they said pass the witness. Epic came

1333
01:19:57,155 --> 01:20:00,995
Speaker 9:  back on and Epic said, you know, so why do you want, you know,

1334
01:20:01,055 --> 01:20:04,955
Speaker 9:  why, why, where do you think you get this same kind of deal where you avoid

1335
01:20:04,955 --> 01:20:07,870
Speaker 9:  paying anybody else anything? And he said, that's how, how it's been on the

1336
01:20:08,065 --> 01:20:11,765
Speaker 9:  PC with Windows. That's how it is on the Mac. You

1337
01:20:11,865 --> 01:20:15,445
Speaker 9:  can put apps on there and not pay somebody to put your apps on there.

1338
01:20:15,665 --> 01:20:19,285
Speaker 9:  So he may believe that this is part of the idealistic thing that he's trying

1339
01:20:19,285 --> 01:20:23,005
Speaker 9:  to do. And I think that he has supporters who also believe that.

1340
01:20:24,215 --> 01:20:26,355
Speaker 9:  I'm not quite sure which side I'm on of that.

1341
01:20:27,545 --> 01:20:30,915
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think that's an open question especially 'cause what's gonna happen

1342
01:20:30,985 --> 01:20:33,635
Speaker 4:  next is both of these cases are on appeal.

1343
01:20:34,835 --> 01:20:38,735
Speaker 4:  And I, I don't know if this is true, this is just my interpretation of the

1344
01:20:38,735 --> 01:20:42,575
Speaker 4:  Apple case. I think the judge ruled the way she did in the Apple case to

1345
01:20:42,875 --> 01:20:46,465
Speaker 4:  set up an appeal, right? There's a reason that

1346
01:20:46,725 --> 01:20:50,265
Speaker 4:  the judge in California felt very comfortable saying,

1347
01:20:50,885 --> 01:20:54,865
Speaker 4:  the state law in California allows me to do a prohibition on anti

1348
01:20:55,065 --> 01:20:58,545
Speaker 4:  steering, but the federal antitrust law does.

1349
01:20:59,085 --> 01:21:01,745
Speaker 4:  I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna run into that fight. I'm gonna let a higher,

1350
01:21:02,205 --> 01:21:06,065
Speaker 4:  I'm a trial court judge. I'm not gonna reinterpret

1351
01:21:06,085 --> 01:21:09,985
Speaker 4:  the antitrust law of the United States. I'm gonna kick that upstairs 'cause

1352
01:21:09,985 --> 01:21:13,105
Speaker 4:  she knows this appeal is coming. So that has always been my read of that.

1353
01:21:13,225 --> 01:21:15,785
Speaker 4:  I think she's a very savvy judge. She developed a trial record, she kicked

1354
01:21:15,785 --> 01:21:19,225
Speaker 4:  it upstairs. This judge had a jury. The jury doesn't give a shit about being

1355
01:21:19,385 --> 01:21:23,185
Speaker 4:  overturned on appeal. You know, like it's a, it's a different case.

1356
01:21:23,185 --> 01:21:25,985
Speaker 4:  Diff facts are different. The markets are different. Both cases are gonna

1357
01:21:25,985 --> 01:21:29,825
Speaker 4:  get appealed. Sean, based on your talk with Tim, you're

1358
01:21:29,985 --> 01:21:32,665
Speaker 4:  covering the trial. What, what do you think Epic is doing next here?

1359
01:21:32,945 --> 01:21:36,625
Speaker 9:  I think Epic is still gonna wait, quote unquote a little bit because

1360
01:21:36,965 --> 01:21:40,905
Speaker 9:  we have until the second week of January before Epic's lawyers

1361
01:21:40,965 --> 01:21:44,665
Speaker 9:  and Google's lawyers come back together and say, Hey judge, what is actually

1362
01:21:44,665 --> 01:21:48,345
Speaker 9:  going to happen now that Epic is won? Because we don't know what the judge

1363
01:21:48,965 --> 01:21:52,785
Speaker 9:  can or will actually grant Epic now that the

1364
01:21:52,785 --> 01:21:56,145
Speaker 9:  jury has said yes, there is, you know, this is an illegal monopoly as far

1365
01:21:56,145 --> 01:21:59,865
Speaker 9:  as we're concerned. So there's that Tim was like, oh yes,

1366
01:21:59,865 --> 01:22:02,345
Speaker 9:  we'll keep fighting everywhere. We've got all these other cases going on

1367
01:22:02,345 --> 01:22:05,545
Speaker 9:  around the world. They're waiting there. I I think there were a couple of

1368
01:22:05,545 --> 01:22:09,505
Speaker 9:  Australia cases that were kind of on hold because

1369
01:22:09,505 --> 01:22:12,705
Speaker 9:  they wanted to see what was going to happen in the US before Australia weighed

1370
01:22:12,705 --> 01:22:13,185
Speaker 9:  in classic

1371
01:22:13,185 --> 01:22:13,665
Speaker 4:  Australia.

1372
01:22:14,085 --> 01:22:17,665
Speaker 9:  And, and of course the Apple one is being appealed. They're, they were both

1373
01:22:17,745 --> 01:22:21,265
Speaker 9:  sides. Both Apple and Google are hoping the Supreme Court will take up the

1374
01:22:21,265 --> 01:22:24,425
Speaker 9:  Apple decision, which has already been through the appeals appellate level.

1375
01:22:24,635 --> 01:22:27,465
Speaker 4:  We'll see All, right? We have a, we have another year of sending Sean to

1376
01:22:27,465 --> 01:22:29,985
Speaker 4:  courtrooms. I'm so sorry, Sean, potentially in Australia.

1377
01:22:32,105 --> 01:22:33,865
Speaker 9:  I, I, I have wanted to visit Australia for a while.

1378
01:22:34,055 --> 01:22:34,345
Speaker 1:  He's

1379
01:22:34,345 --> 01:22:34,545
Speaker 4:  Beautiful.

1380
01:22:36,205 --> 01:22:38,905
Speaker 4:  All, right? We gotta take a break. We're gonna do a lightning round. We'll

1381
01:22:38,905 --> 01:22:39,265
Speaker 4:  grab on

1382
01:24:25,965 --> 01:24:29,145
Speaker 4:  All, right? We're back. Sean's sticking with us for the lightning round.

1383
01:24:29,825 --> 01:24:33,435
Speaker 4:  Sean, you're the guest of honor even cooped up for a Fortnite in Fortnite

1384
01:24:33,435 --> 01:24:34,715
Speaker 4:  court with Tim Sweeney. one of the

1385
01:24:34,715 --> 01:24:37,915
Speaker 6:  Best headlines we've run in a while, by the way, a Fortnite in Fortnite

1386
01:24:37,915 --> 01:24:40,675
Speaker 4:  Court, but people got mad at us. They're like, you're too gleeful about Epic

1387
01:24:40,675 --> 01:24:42,755
Speaker 4:  women. I'm like, the company's name is Epic. Yeah. What, what

1388
01:24:42,755 --> 01:24:43,155
Speaker 6:  Are we supposed

1389
01:24:43,155 --> 01:24:46,915
Speaker 4:  To do here? There's not a journalist in the country or world that can stay

1390
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:50,595
Speaker 4:  away from Epic victory in this moment. What are you talking about?

1391
01:24:50,825 --> 01:24:51,115
Speaker 4:  Epic

1392
01:24:51,255 --> 01:24:54,515
Speaker 9:  Win Epic victory for a while. Whether they read the Apple case. It's

1393
01:24:54,535 --> 01:24:56,195
Speaker 4:  The name of the company. Yeah.

1394
01:24:56,195 --> 01:24:59,875
Speaker 6:  It's not even like anyone who's reading that as an adjective is wrong.

1395
01:25:00,025 --> 01:25:01,955
Speaker 6:  Epic Epic win. It's, it's a fact.

1396
01:25:02,055 --> 01:25:04,475
Speaker 10:  Can you imagine the other way? Google win. Google

1397
01:25:04,475 --> 01:25:07,155
Speaker 4:  Victory read. It's like people just start searching. What did they win?

1398
01:25:08,095 --> 01:25:09,555
Speaker 4:  Bard's like, I don't know. Yeah.

1399
01:25:09,765 --> 01:25:12,675
Speaker 9:  Can't tell that. During, during the Apple case we called the Judge Epic Judge

1400
01:25:12,735 --> 01:25:14,235
Speaker 9:  fairly often. That was fun. Yeah.

1401
01:25:14,235 --> 01:25:16,915
Speaker 4:  Yeah. That's very good. All, right? Sean, you're the guest of honor. You

1402
01:25:16,915 --> 01:25:18,395
Speaker 4:  get to go first. What's your lightning round item?

1403
01:25:19,105 --> 01:25:22,915
Speaker 9:  Opera's gamer browser now has a panic button for when you're caught in the

1404
01:25:22,915 --> 01:25:23,435
Speaker 9:  act. Oh boy.

1405
01:25:23,555 --> 01:25:23,995
Speaker 4:  I knew you

1406
01:25:23,995 --> 01:25:25,035
Speaker 9:  Were gonna pick. Oh boy. And I

1407
01:25:26,675 --> 01:25:29,395
Speaker 9:  I don, I don't don don't wanna talk about the panic button. I wanna talk

1408
01:25:29,395 --> 01:25:33,155
Speaker 9:  about how Opera has a browser that has to

1409
01:25:33,215 --> 01:25:37,155
Speaker 9:  go to these incredible ridiculous gamer centric

1410
01:25:37,275 --> 01:25:40,995
Speaker 9:  extremes in order to differentiate from Chrome the

1411
01:25:41,235 --> 01:25:45,115
Speaker 9:  dominant browser because nobody else can compete. And we've just

1412
01:25:45,115 --> 01:25:47,195
Speaker 9:  been talking about Google competing with things like

1413
01:25:47,815 --> 01:25:51,275
Speaker 4:  No, this is, but this is the competition. This is, you need a browser

1414
01:25:51,545 --> 01:25:55,195
Speaker 4:  that can set limits on CPU and GPU usage. So you can keep gaming

1415
01:25:55,655 --> 01:25:59,475
Speaker 4:  at your full frame rates and that has a panic button. So if someone

1416
01:25:59,485 --> 01:26:02,835
Speaker 4:  walks in while you're gaming Mm. It's

1417
01:26:02,835 --> 01:26:03,885
Speaker 5:  Very resource intensive.

1418
01:26:04,145 --> 01:26:07,765
Speaker 9:  And there's a, there's a little known feature in Opera GX where if you die,

1419
01:26:08,675 --> 01:26:12,365
Speaker 9:  hopefully you press the button that told it to delete all your history so

1420
01:26:12,365 --> 01:26:14,445
Speaker 9:  that they won't see the things that you were looking at when you press

1421
01:26:14,445 --> 01:26:16,925
Speaker 6:  The panic button. If you, I just, my favorite thing about this is that it

1422
01:26:17,105 --> 01:26:20,445
Speaker 6:  it, when you press F 12, which jumps you out of whatever you're doing into

1423
01:26:20,445 --> 01:26:24,365
Speaker 6:  a quote unquote safe tab, one of the options they give you is to go to Twitch.

1424
01:26:24,455 --> 01:26:25,685
Speaker 6:  Which is like, is that better?

1425
01:26:27,785 --> 01:26:28,925
Speaker 4:  Oh, I'm playing a video game.

1426
01:26:29,125 --> 01:26:31,285
Speaker 6:  I don't want my boss to see me. Lemme go to Twitch.

1427
01:26:31,795 --> 01:26:33,885
Speaker 5:  Does it auto mute too?

1428
01:26:35,525 --> 01:26:36,205
Speaker 6:  I have not. Does

1429
01:26:36,205 --> 01:26:39,885
Speaker 5:  The tab auto mute? It should. I was gonna say Alex ask

1430
01:26:39,885 --> 01:26:40,285
Speaker 6:  Hard questions.

1431
01:26:40,485 --> 01:26:44,085
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I'll, if you, I, you know what? I don't want to linger on this for

1432
01:26:44,085 --> 01:26:44,845
Speaker 4:  one second. Longer.

1433
01:26:45,835 --> 01:26:46,365
Speaker 5:  Rest of

1434
01:26:46,365 --> 01:26:48,765
Speaker 4:  Around. If you're in a situation where you need a panic button in your browser,

1435
01:26:48,835 --> 01:26:50,325
Speaker 4:  fucking volume should be off.

1436
01:26:50,895 --> 01:26:53,405
Speaker 6:  Headphones. People headphones.

1437
01:26:54,645 --> 01:26:58,525
Speaker 5:  Freshman in college get this browser you share in a dorm room,

1438
01:26:58,865 --> 01:26:59,645
Speaker 5:  you get this browser.

1439
01:27:00,305 --> 01:27:00,525
Speaker 4:  Oh

1440
01:27:00,525 --> 01:27:02,365
Speaker 9:  My God. Can't wait to see their market show.

1441
01:27:02,465 --> 01:27:02,685
Speaker 6:  Boy,

1442
01:27:04,335 --> 01:27:05,125
Speaker 4:  Thank you Sean.

1443
01:27:07,425 --> 01:27:09,685
Speaker 4:  Why? Why did I do this? All, right?

1444
01:27:11,105 --> 01:27:14,605
Speaker 4:  Pierce, can you just, just clean, clean us up somehow?

1445
01:27:14,875 --> 01:27:18,725
Speaker 6:  Mine is the Apple TV app, which has a new panic button where

1446
01:27:18,725 --> 01:27:19,285
Speaker 6:  when you're

1447
01:27:22,095 --> 01:27:23,405
Speaker 5:  Takes you to HBO max.

1448
01:27:24,065 --> 01:27:24,285
Speaker 4:  So

1449
01:27:24,935 --> 01:27:25,285
Speaker 6:  Apple,

1450
01:27:26,265 --> 01:27:28,245
Speaker 4:  The dark recesses of HBO Max,

1451
01:27:28,505 --> 01:27:31,165
Speaker 6:  You hit a button and you go to HGCV just like that. It's like, no problem.

1452
01:27:31,525 --> 01:27:33,685
Speaker 6:  Whatever you were watching. No, the Apple

1453
01:27:34,715 --> 01:27:37,365
Speaker 4:  Somewhere. David's ZZ was like, ship a panic button.

1454
01:27:38,995 --> 01:27:40,045
Speaker 4:  This is how we win.

1455
01:27:40,675 --> 01:27:41,765
Speaker 6:  Yeah, you can have that for free too.

1456
01:27:41,765 --> 01:27:42,965
Speaker 5:  No one can know. You watch Gilded

1457
01:27:42,965 --> 01:27:46,845
Speaker 6:  Age. The Apple TV app just got a redesign on the Apple tv.

1458
01:27:47,175 --> 01:27:51,045
Speaker 6:  Apple has had this like don don't know, 15 year long obsession

1459
01:27:51,045 --> 01:27:54,805
Speaker 6:  with like trying to solve the interface of television. And I think it's like

1460
01:27:54,805 --> 01:27:58,405
Speaker 6:  the most quixotic thing Apple is trying to do. It's either that or build

1461
01:27:58,445 --> 01:28:01,485
Speaker 6:  a car. Like one two equally impossible. Yeah. Goals.

1462
01:28:02,545 --> 01:28:06,125
Speaker 6:  But the new TV app actually looks really nice. They've redesigned it. It

1463
01:28:06,145 --> 01:28:09,245
Speaker 6:  has easier ways to get to some of the channels you can get at through Apple

1464
01:28:09,345 --> 01:28:13,285
Speaker 6:  tv. It has some easy ways to get to like buying stuff from much

1465
01:28:13,285 --> 01:28:16,405
Speaker 6:  different platforms. Apple's big idea is to be like the TV guide for all

1466
01:28:16,405 --> 01:28:18,845
Speaker 6:  your streaming stuff. So it pulls all the stuff you're watching, all the

1467
01:28:18,845 --> 01:28:21,605
Speaker 6:  recommendations, all this stuff into one place. It notably does not have

1468
01:28:21,605 --> 01:28:25,525
Speaker 6:  Netflix, which like immediately destroys its utility for a large number of

1469
01:28:25,525 --> 01:28:26,085
Speaker 6:  users. Because

1470
01:28:26,395 --> 01:28:29,125
Speaker 4:  This is what I'm saying about net, like when when one monopoly hits another

1471
01:28:29,125 --> 01:28:29,445
Speaker 4:  one. Yeah.

1472
01:28:29,445 --> 01:28:32,475
Speaker 5:  It's also bad at a lot of other ones too.

1473
01:28:33,245 --> 01:28:37,145
Speaker 6:  It is. Apple. Apple I like, I think is on the right path here. I just

1474
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:41,065
Speaker 6:  think it's impossible to do what it's trying to do. But I admire Apple for

1475
01:28:41,065 --> 01:28:44,105
Speaker 6:  just continuing to believe that it is Apple. And so it can eventually bully

1476
01:28:44,105 --> 01:28:47,185
Speaker 6:  every other company into being part of this. But the new app is very nice.

1477
01:28:47,305 --> 01:28:51,025
Speaker 6:  I suspect we'll get a lot of this stuff on other platforms as well. And like

1478
01:28:51,965 --> 01:28:55,865
Speaker 6:  the streaming interface that we have sucks and somebody should

1479
01:28:56,045 --> 01:28:59,585
Speaker 6:  fix it. And like, I don't care if it's Apple, I don't care if it's like,

1480
01:28:59,655 --> 01:29:02,765
Speaker 6:  just watch, like pick a company. don don't. I don't care if it's Plex. No

1481
01:29:02,765 --> 01:29:05,125
Speaker 6:  one cant. I should want it to be Plex. I would like for it to be Plex. Plex.

1482
01:29:05,125 --> 01:29:05,485
Speaker 6:  Could you please

1483
01:29:05,485 --> 01:29:09,365
Speaker 9:  See this? I just wanna say that Steve Jobs did not tell Walter Isaacson

1484
01:29:09,435 --> 01:29:13,085
Speaker 9:  on's deathbed that he wanted to build a car. He said he'd cracked the TV

1485
01:29:13,145 --> 01:29:14,765
Speaker 9:  and it's about the time they cracked it. It's

1486
01:29:14,765 --> 01:29:16,325
Speaker 6:  Exactly right. That's exactly right.

1487
01:29:17,335 --> 01:29:21,035
Speaker 4:  Really the whole company chased this like deathbed comment for

1488
01:29:21,135 --> 01:29:22,075
Speaker 4:  too long. Do you

1489
01:29:22,075 --> 01:29:25,315
Speaker 6:  Think Steve just meant like his, he, he cracked his tv. He like threw something

1490
01:29:25,315 --> 01:29:28,115
Speaker 6:  at his television and cracked it and Walter just like, he threw

1491
01:29:28,155 --> 01:29:28,475
Speaker 4:  A remote.

1492
01:29:32,935 --> 01:29:35,915
Speaker 4:  So we bought a new house. We're like, I'm building a home theater down there.

1493
01:29:35,915 --> 01:29:39,115
Speaker 4:  It's like a whole thing. There's speaker wire everywhere. The poor electrician

1494
01:29:39,115 --> 01:29:42,075
Speaker 4:  just keeps looking at me like I'm crazy. It's great.

1495
01:29:43,175 --> 01:29:46,835
Speaker 4:  So two, two things. One, in the meantime we have a Samsung Frame tv, which

1496
01:29:46,835 --> 01:29:47,955
Speaker 4:  will eventually be the bedroom tv

1497
01:29:49,855 --> 01:29:53,835
Speaker 4:  and I have used ties in now. Mm. I'm just

1498
01:29:54,355 --> 01:29:55,755
Speaker 5:  A moment of silence for Neli

1499
01:29:56,435 --> 01:30:00,355
Speaker 4:  Ties, Tieszen Support Club more for you. Please help me.

1500
01:30:01,175 --> 01:30:04,635
Speaker 4:  But Samsung does one very smart thing with Tieszen on this TV in the builtin

1501
01:30:04,795 --> 01:30:08,115
Speaker 4:  software. When you're watching YouTube TV and you click out of it and you

1502
01:30:08,115 --> 01:30:11,515
Speaker 4:  sound like go back to any other place where there should be media playing,

1503
01:30:11,775 --> 01:30:15,475
Speaker 4:  it just starts playing it again as though you are just watching tv.

1504
01:30:15,705 --> 01:30:19,435
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's, it is just very, it's just very clever. It just

1505
01:30:19,635 --> 01:30:23,395
Speaker 4:  restarts your streaming app and it just has media playing where you're like

1506
01:30:23,505 --> 01:30:27,275
Speaker 4:  goofing around in the menus or whatever. It makes it feel like a TV and not

1507
01:30:27,275 --> 01:30:30,955
Speaker 4:  like the Apple tv, which very much feels like a tiny iOS device

1508
01:30:31,105 --> 01:30:34,155
Speaker 4:  that is very upset that you are not watching Apple TV plus.

1509
01:30:34,375 --> 01:30:37,435
Speaker 6:  Or like all the fire TVs now, which are like, oh, you turn on your TVs, here's

1510
01:30:37,435 --> 01:30:40,795
Speaker 6:  some ads. Do you wanna watch some ads? How about some ads as soon as

1511
01:30:40,795 --> 01:30:41,475
Speaker 5:  You turn it on.

1512
01:30:42,185 --> 01:30:45,395
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So there, there's something there which I think is just really clever

1513
01:30:45,455 --> 01:30:49,235
Speaker 4:  and smart. Yep. In Python. But it's part of the turn you're talking about

1514
01:30:49,235 --> 01:30:53,195
Speaker 4:  these interfaces suck because they're all trying to get

1515
01:30:53,195 --> 01:30:55,555
Speaker 4:  you to do something you don't want to do. Or they're all trying to keep you

1516
01:30:55,555 --> 01:30:59,475
Speaker 4:  away from watching TV or they wanna show you ads. Particularly like

1517
01:30:59,475 --> 01:31:03,155
Speaker 4:  Alex writes about Fast all the time, right? Like free ad supporting TV is

1518
01:31:03,155 --> 01:31:05,395
Speaker 4:  a big thing, which means they're desperately trying to get you to watch free

1519
01:31:05,395 --> 01:31:08,275
Speaker 4:  ad supported tv. That's weird. The second thing,

1520
01:31:10,025 --> 01:31:13,755
Speaker 4:  I've been thinking about this a lot with just Apple TV and like what will

1521
01:31:13,755 --> 01:31:17,075
Speaker 4:  be my primary device and here's what I've settled on. I'm gonna buy a Sony

1522
01:31:17,195 --> 01:31:21,115
Speaker 4:  a 95 L. Okay. They're not in stock anywhere. And I'm just gonna watch

1523
01:31:21,255 --> 01:31:24,995
Speaker 4:  Bravia core Sony's proprietary streaming service that has the highest bit

1524
01:31:24,995 --> 01:31:25,995
Speaker 4:  rates in the entire industry.

1525
01:31:26,335 --> 01:31:26,715
Speaker 6:  Oh boy.

1526
01:31:27,175 --> 01:31:28,315
Speaker 4:  In that Spiderman

1527
01:31:28,315 --> 01:31:31,715
Speaker 5:  Spider's gonna look so good on that tv. It's gonna be the red suit. It has

1528
01:31:31,715 --> 01:31:35,675
Speaker 4:  Like four movies. It's Yeah. Yeah. Look it has, I

1529
01:31:35,675 --> 01:31:37,595
Speaker 4:  think it has 4, 4 4

1530
01:31:38,265 --> 01:31:41,395
Speaker 5:  Reds. See? See you're gonna, you that's, they love to be like, look how good

1531
01:31:41,395 --> 01:31:43,515
Speaker 5:  Spider-Man looks with our high bit rate. Red

1532
01:31:43,515 --> 01:31:46,915
Speaker 4:  Is red, red is famously the hardest color to compress and

1533
01:31:47,035 --> 01:31:50,635
Speaker 4:  Spider-Man's a great demo. Yep. I'm gonna watch the hell outta

1534
01:31:50,635 --> 01:31:51,235
Speaker 4:  Spider-Man.

1535
01:31:51,425 --> 01:31:54,835
Speaker 5:  That and Red Buses in England. They're like, look at it, it's

1536
01:31:54,985 --> 01:31:56,875
Speaker 5:  beautiful. You're like, it's fine.

1537
01:31:57,905 --> 01:32:01,845
Speaker 4:  Yeah, don don't know it just like all of my stuff, I, I bought

1538
01:32:01,925 --> 01:32:04,925
Speaker 4:  a lot of movies in Apple and now it's like this thing does not want me to,

1539
01:32:05,115 --> 01:32:09,005
Speaker 4:  they shut down the movies app and the TV app, which I never ever used, but

1540
01:32:09,005 --> 01:32:11,685
Speaker 4:  they shut down the movies app and it's like, oh, I just wanted to see what

1541
01:32:11,685 --> 01:32:15,565
Speaker 4:  was out and like watch a movie and now it's like I have to contend with the

1542
01:32:15,565 --> 01:32:19,415
Speaker 4:  morning show. Like, here it is, here's just, do you want

1543
01:32:19,435 --> 01:32:22,975
Speaker 4:  the morning pay for this? Yeah. Watch it. And I'm like, I just wanna see

1544
01:32:22,975 --> 01:32:25,175
Speaker 4:  what movies are out. don don't know. Are

1545
01:32:25,175 --> 01:32:26,175
Speaker 9:  Any of us holding onto to discs?

1546
01:32:26,335 --> 01:32:26,775
Speaker 5:  I just bought a

1547
01:32:26,775 --> 01:32:29,735
Speaker 9:  Bunch. I've still got my 4K discs. They go in my PSS five. They just bought

1548
01:32:29,735 --> 01:32:31,495
Speaker 9:  a bunch. That's how I watch my, my good looking movies.

1549
01:32:32,215 --> 01:32:34,575
Speaker 4:  I I was gonna do that. But Bravia core dog,

1550
01:32:35,525 --> 01:32:39,495
Speaker 6:  Sean, I will say history is increasingly proving you, right? Yeah. I

1551
01:32:39,495 --> 01:32:43,415
Speaker 6:  was not here last week to be furious at what Sony did, removing all

1552
01:32:43,415 --> 01:32:47,375
Speaker 6:  the stuff that people had bought on on their PlayStations. But that shit

1553
01:32:47,385 --> 01:32:51,015
Speaker 6:  sucks. Yeah. And we are rapidly nearing a point where legitimately, if you

1554
01:32:51,015 --> 01:32:53,415
Speaker 6:  wanna make sure you can watch something, you're gonna have to buy it on disc,

1555
01:32:53,585 --> 01:32:56,535
Speaker 6:  which is like a dumb place to end up. but it feels

1556
01:32:56,535 --> 01:32:59,735
Speaker 5:  Like we're it's beautiful headed. No, it's, I've now got Michael Doffs, American

1557
01:32:59,865 --> 01:33:02,935
Speaker 5:  Ninja from the eighties on DVD and like

1558
01:33:04,425 --> 01:33:05,855
Speaker 5:  can't find that on streaming

1559
01:33:05,995 --> 01:33:07,695
Speaker 6:  All. right? Well there's Alex's like, whatcha gonna

1560
01:33:07,695 --> 01:33:11,615
Speaker 5:  Do you wanna watch that horror show? m like only one

1561
01:33:11,615 --> 01:33:14,775
Speaker 5:  way to watch it. Oh my God. If my sister's listening, I'm sorry. You now

1562
01:33:14,775 --> 01:33:15,095
Speaker 5:  know what you're,

1563
01:33:15,205 --> 01:33:15,775
Speaker 6:  It's too many

1564
01:33:19,395 --> 01:33:22,495
Speaker 4:  All. right. I'll do mine and then we'll end with Cranz. Mine is

1565
01:33:23,615 --> 01:33:26,495
Speaker 4:  a weird week for electric cars just around the board, but

1566
01:33:29,015 --> 01:33:31,895
Speaker 4:  Cadillac announced the Cadillac of Tik,

1567
01:33:32,715 --> 01:33:36,665
Speaker 4:  which is their next electric SUV. It looks pretty

1568
01:33:36,665 --> 01:33:39,905
Speaker 4:  good. It looks like a little baby Escalade Cadillac. I just wanna point out

1569
01:33:40,145 --> 01:33:44,105
Speaker 4:  Cadillac's prices for EVs are completely out of control. So this

1570
01:33:44,105 --> 01:33:47,465
Speaker 4:  one is going to cost $90,000. And I will remind you

1571
01:33:47,925 --> 01:33:51,065
Speaker 4:  it is called the Tik within IQ because I was

1572
01:33:51,265 --> 01:33:54,745
Speaker 6:  Cadillac. What what does Cadillac do? There's like the, the

1573
01:33:55,425 --> 01:33:57,025
Speaker 6:  lyric, which I assume is now pronounced

1574
01:33:57,265 --> 01:33:57,465
Speaker 4:  Lyric

1575
01:33:58,245 --> 01:34:02,185
Speaker 6:  And the, the que and the, there was like the Cinque and the

1576
01:34:02,385 --> 01:34:05,785
Speaker 6:  Celeste, like who at Cadillac keeps being like, you know what's dope is our

1577
01:34:05,865 --> 01:34:07,985
Speaker 6:  q names that are unpronounceable, like stop it.

1578
01:34:09,725 --> 01:34:12,865
Speaker 4:  So yeah, they, they start with a lyric, which sort of makes sense.

1579
01:34:12,865 --> 01:34:15,225
Speaker 6:  It's actually pronounced Ric. Sorry don don't know if I just wanna,

1580
01:34:16,365 --> 01:34:19,665
Speaker 4:  The, the Ric is actually kind of reasonably

1581
01:34:19,965 --> 01:34:23,465
Speaker 4:  priced. It's like you can get one in the sixties, which for a Cadillac is

1582
01:34:23,465 --> 01:34:26,905
Speaker 4:  like in the zone. They have, they have a cheaper one that

01:34:54,505 --> 01:34:58,325
Speaker 6:  I say that these cars are hot. Like I'm, I'm very into the styling they have

1593
01:34:58,325 --> 01:34:58,645
Speaker 6:  for these.

1594
01:34:59,285 --> 01:35:03,245
Speaker 4:  I have, I don't, I don't need a car. I moved back

1595
01:35:03,245 --> 01:35:06,525
Speaker 4:  to Civilization. I don't live in the woods anymore. I live in a very walkable

1596
01:35:06,525 --> 01:35:09,565
Speaker 4:  place. I'm like, I should buy a lyric all the time. I'm like, I should buy

1597
01:35:09,565 --> 01:35:12,205
Speaker 4:  a lyric. And I'm like, why? I would never. So you can say Lyric,

1598
01:35:13,785 --> 01:35:17,765
Speaker 4:  we have a hybrid with 25 miles of electric range. I haven't bought gas in

1599
01:35:17,765 --> 01:35:19,845
Speaker 4:  three months. 'cause that's all we need. Yeah.

1600
01:35:19,855 --> 01:35:20,765
Speaker 6:  How's the pickup truck

1601
01:35:21,925 --> 01:35:22,605
Speaker 4:  Pickup's going?

1602
01:35:24,245 --> 01:35:26,605
Speaker 4:  I love it so much and I need to get rid of it. And I

1603
01:35:28,515 --> 01:35:29,165
Speaker 4:  come on

1604
01:35:29,415 --> 01:35:32,725
Speaker 9:  Still waiting for the Iion, which is a Hyundai vehicle

1605
01:35:33,545 --> 01:35:35,485
Speaker 9:  to get some NACS charging.

1606
01:35:36,265 --> 01:35:38,925
Speaker 4:  Who decided? Huge. Also, I shouldn't buy any of this stuff. The future, what

1607
01:35:38,925 --> 01:35:41,005
Speaker 4:  are doing Until they, until they have the Chargers.

1608
01:35:41,865 --> 01:35:43,005
Speaker 9:  We need the Chargers

1609
01:35:43,225 --> 01:35:43,565
Speaker 5:  One day

1610
01:35:44,515 --> 01:35:47,015
Speaker 4:  All. right. I'm gonna buy a Cadillac All. right.

1611
01:35:49,195 --> 01:35:50,375
Speaker 4:  It does look pretty good. All, right?

1612
01:35:50,645 --> 01:35:53,965
Speaker 5:  This one, this one's a little sad. Take sound. I've been

1613
01:35:54,385 --> 01:35:57,565
Speaker 5:  2003. I was in college and I met a guy

1614
01:35:58,225 --> 01:36:01,755
Speaker 5:  and he said, he said panic button.

1615
01:36:01,755 --> 01:36:02,275
Speaker 4:  Panic button.

1616
01:36:02,415 --> 01:36:06,395
Speaker 5:  He said, Hey, my uncle's a producer at like Today show

1617
01:36:06,415 --> 01:36:10,355
Speaker 5:  or something. He's going to E three. Do you want to go? And I

1618
01:36:10,385 --> 01:36:14,315
Speaker 5:  went in college to E three and then I went for the next 10

1619
01:36:14,315 --> 01:36:15,275
Speaker 5:  years. Wow.

1620
01:36:16,815 --> 01:36:20,635
Speaker 5:  Not always with with hi his, his family and,

1621
01:36:20,735 --> 01:36:23,715
Speaker 5:  and the, the hosts of the Today Show or whatever was great.

1622
01:36:24,825 --> 01:36:28,485
Speaker 5:  And, and then I never went again 'cause it got really bad and it continued

1623
01:36:28,485 --> 01:36:32,165
Speaker 5:  to get bad. And E three just got less and less and less

1624
01:36:32,225 --> 01:36:36,205
Speaker 5:  useful. And that is why this year E three is officially

1625
01:36:36,355 --> 01:36:40,235
Speaker 5:  dead. It was the trade show for video games like Sean.

1626
01:36:40,235 --> 01:36:42,395
Speaker 5:  Did you ever go to E three? Yeah. I feel like you went to E three.

1627
01:36:44,495 --> 01:36:45,875
Speaker 5:  It was like, like it was kind of fun.

1628
01:36:45,975 --> 01:36:46,875
Speaker 9:  Should I tell the story?

1629
01:36:46,935 --> 01:36:49,315
Speaker 4:  Sean's like, I was born in the dark. It was fun.

1630
01:36:49,735 --> 01:36:53,715
Speaker 5:  You was, you saw cool stuff. Oh good. You know, I went, I went the year that

1631
01:36:53,715 --> 01:36:56,755
Speaker 5:  they, they moved it all to Santa Monica and you had to see all the video

1632
01:36:56,755 --> 01:36:59,995
Speaker 5:  games in an airplane hangar and otherwise you just had to know a lot of people.

1633
01:37:00,055 --> 01:37:03,955
Speaker 5:  And I did not So I spent a lot of time on the beach. That E three, it was

1634
01:37:03,955 --> 01:37:05,035
Speaker 5:  great, but

1635
01:37:06,655 --> 01:37:08,995
Speaker 5:  that's what I should have done. It's really, really nice.

1636
01:37:09,625 --> 01:37:12,435
Speaker 6:  Sean what's your weirdest e three story? I feel like there I can just see

1637
01:37:12,435 --> 01:37:14,915
Speaker 6:  on your face. Yeah. You have a weird E three story that You don't wanna tell.

1638
01:37:14,915 --> 01:37:16,035
Speaker 6:  You have to tell. I would like you to tell it

1639
01:37:16,515 --> 01:37:18,795
Speaker 9:  A weird e three story. I don't want to tell. Or do you or do you want, or

1640
01:37:18,795 --> 01:37:22,035
Speaker 9:  do you want the good one? The one about the good one? The one I told one.

1641
01:37:22,035 --> 01:37:23,155
Speaker 9:  Give us a good one. I love a good All, right? I'll,

1642
01:37:23,315 --> 01:37:24,115
Speaker 4:  I gotta a good one. Okay.

1643
01:37:24,115 --> 01:37:27,835
Speaker 9:  I'm just gonna read from my CNET article because, because I haven't

1644
01:37:27,955 --> 01:37:30,235
Speaker 9:  rewritten this and I, I'll just do my voice. It'll be great.

1645
01:37:32,755 --> 01:37:36,715
Speaker 9:  I was playing Warhawk. The first game for Sony's just announced PSS three

1646
01:37:36,715 --> 01:37:39,995
Speaker 9:  motion controller where you could fly a heavily armored war plane just by

1647
01:37:39,995 --> 01:37:43,475
Speaker 9:  tilting a game pad. Believe it or not, those simple motion controls were

1648
01:37:43,635 --> 01:37:47,075
Speaker 9:  revolutionary at the time. This was before the iPhone was announced. Before

1649
01:37:47,075 --> 01:37:50,195
Speaker 9:  Twitter existed and even before the Nintendo, we and PS three were released.

1650
01:37:50,575 --> 01:37:53,995
Speaker 9:  To give you some context yet on the show floor, there wasn't much of a line.

1651
01:37:54,415 --> 01:37:58,125
Speaker 9:  We only had to wait a few minutes before I got to try this potentially groundbreaking

1652
01:37:58,135 --> 01:38:01,845
Speaker 9:  title. The longer I played, the more people crowded around me.

1653
01:38:02,555 --> 01:38:06,445
Speaker 9:  Soon I felt like a star. I was on fire playing war, like, like a champ

1654
01:38:06,445 --> 01:38:09,605
Speaker 9:  in front of my very old audience. The more people watched, the better I played

1655
01:38:09,605 --> 01:38:13,365
Speaker 9:  flying that deadly war plane with precision. Then it was over. I turned

1656
01:38:13,565 --> 01:38:17,445
Speaker 9:  around and handed the controller two. She guru me a mode.

1657
01:38:20,315 --> 01:38:23,005
Speaker 4:  This is a dream you had, right? This is not an story.

1658
01:38:23,585 --> 01:38:27,525
Speaker 9:  Father of Barrio Zelda was behind me the whole time. The crowd

1659
01:38:27,525 --> 01:38:28,325
Speaker 9:  had been there for him

1660
01:38:29,955 --> 01:38:33,605
Speaker 9:  because they were watching the man who developed the We Motion

1661
01:38:33,655 --> 01:38:37,605
Speaker 9:  controller, try his competitor's product for the first time. And

1662
01:38:37,605 --> 01:38:41,165
Speaker 9:  you're just like, wow. And So I just stood there dumbfounded. He's playing,

1663
01:38:41,685 --> 01:38:45,245
Speaker 9:  watching Bebo to play this game and his face had no expression on it.

1664
01:38:45,515 --> 01:38:46,885
Speaker 9:  None. Yeah. Stone cold.

1665
01:38:46,945 --> 01:38:50,765
Speaker 5:  He was not as impressed with your playing. Fantastic. Was he?

1666
01:38:51,825 --> 01:38:53,085
Speaker 5:  Oh, I just saw like,

1667
01:38:53,755 --> 01:38:56,925
Speaker 4:  Well, Sean didn't know he wasn't paying attention. He was locked in the

1668
01:38:56,945 --> 01:38:57,765
Speaker 9:  War game. Blame for my

1669
01:38:57,805 --> 01:39:01,645
Speaker 5:  Audience. Saw Paris Hilton and like those, those TV or the, the

1670
01:39:01,725 --> 01:39:04,885
Speaker 5:  T-shirt cannons. He had t-shirt cannons of

1671
01:39:06,545 --> 01:39:07,215
Speaker 9:  Everything.

1672
01:39:07,295 --> 01:39:11,015
Speaker 4:  I never went to, I've never been once some weird stuff. Every instinct I

1673
01:39:11,015 --> 01:39:14,335
Speaker 4:  ever had was to stay away. It's good and, and I, I feel like it collapsed

1674
01:39:14,335 --> 01:39:18,295
Speaker 4:  on itself, right? Like it was a trade show that three big companies

1675
01:39:18,295 --> 01:39:21,815
Speaker 4:  were there. I think in Covid, sort like Microsoft pulled out. Then Sony pulled

1676
01:39:21,835 --> 01:39:24,575
Speaker 4:  out and there was like a question of whether it'll come back. And I think

1677
01:39:24,575 --> 01:39:28,535
Speaker 4:  those companies all, were like, wait, this sucked. Like we

1678
01:39:28,535 --> 01:39:31,335
Speaker 4:  can just do our own events, which is what all the tech companies have realized

1679
01:39:31,335 --> 01:39:34,975
Speaker 4:  over time. And there was no, there was no chance it was ever coming back

1680
01:39:35,195 --> 01:39:39,055
Speaker 9:  For years. I heard people say, oh, e three's gonna die this next year.

1681
01:39:39,735 --> 01:39:42,015
Speaker 9:  We don't need it. Particularly after that Santa Monica show where it got

1682
01:39:42,015 --> 01:39:44,855
Speaker 9:  like really tiny, they were like, oh, we don't need E three. But what I kept

1683
01:39:44,855 --> 01:39:48,775
Speaker 9:  hearing smart people in the room say was that

1684
01:39:48,835 --> 01:39:52,575
Speaker 9:  the executives at the video game companies would always need a

1685
01:39:52,575 --> 01:39:56,295
Speaker 9:  stage so that they could go glad hand each other and they

1686
01:39:56,295 --> 01:40:00,135
Speaker 9:  needed to have like some place where the meetings would happen. And now

1687
01:40:00,135 --> 01:40:03,655
Speaker 9:  we have Jeff Keeley with the Summer Game Fest and all those things,

1688
01:40:04,395 --> 01:40:07,935
Speaker 9:  and he'll gladly let people, executives, gland, hand each other on stage

1689
01:40:07,935 --> 01:40:09,615
Speaker 9:  even if they have nothing to show. Yeah.

1690
01:40:09,655 --> 01:40:13,575
Speaker 5:  I mean that, that's, that's exactly what happened. Like that 2008 Santa Monica

1691
01:40:13,725 --> 01:40:17,695
Speaker 5:  show was, it had gotten too big, right? Like 2007 was enormous. It

1692
01:40:17,695 --> 01:40:20,975
Speaker 5:  was really, really unwieldy. It was not a great time. And so they said, okay,

1693
01:40:20,975 --> 01:40:24,895
Speaker 5:  we're gonna shrink it down. And then they reopened it and

1694
01:40:24,895 --> 01:40:27,455
Speaker 5:  they were like, well, we need more people, so we're gonna let anybody come.

1695
01:40:28,315 --> 01:40:31,695
Speaker 5:  And that just made it like not a trade show anymore, but this weird

1696
01:40:32,075 --> 01:40:35,255
Speaker 5:  hybrid that didn't make anybody happy. And then finally,

1697
01:40:36,465 --> 01:40:40,325
Speaker 5:  COVID came and like, like Covid Covid effectively,

1698
01:40:40,435 --> 01:40:44,085
Speaker 5:  like they realized Oh, all, yeah. Everybody realized, oh wait, don don't

1699
01:40:44,085 --> 01:40:47,845
Speaker 5:  need this. I don't actually need the Glad hand here. Jeff Cleve. Jeff,

1700
01:40:47,995 --> 01:40:51,005
Speaker 5:  Jeff Keeley, and you know, a web

1701
01:40:52,235 --> 01:40:53,725
Speaker 5:  broadcast is enough for me.

1702
01:40:55,875 --> 01:40:58,735
Speaker 4:  All, right. Well that's the Vergecast. We'll back next week. Cs,

1703
01:41:01,355 --> 01:41:03,455
Speaker 5:  The vibes are different for CES. People are

1704
01:41:03,455 --> 01:41:04,455
Speaker 11:  Pumped speaking such a downer. People are

1705
01:41:04,455 --> 01:41:05,135
Speaker 4:  Pumped. Are they?

1706
01:41:06,925 --> 01:41:10,575
Speaker 4:  Well we things, things that did not stop at

1707
01:41:10,575 --> 01:41:11,015
Speaker 6:  The pandemic

1708
01:41:11,925 --> 01:41:15,855
Speaker 4:  Back with a vengeance. Cs. No, that's it. Sean, thank you

1709
01:41:15,855 --> 01:41:17,815
Speaker 4:  so much for coming. This has been really fun. Oh, thank you.

1710
01:41:18,045 --> 01:41:21,855
Speaker 6:  Wait, can I just say one more thing before you, before you take us out? I

1711
01:41:21,855 --> 01:41:25,575
Speaker 6:  just, I just wanna shout out a, a person on Threads named Mark

1712
01:41:26,085 --> 01:41:29,775
Speaker 6:  Pono who decided that what he would do is post at me every single day

1713
01:41:30,305 --> 01:41:33,615
Speaker 6:  until I mentioned him on a Vergecast episode, which I had no intention of

1714
01:41:33,615 --> 01:41:37,175
Speaker 6:  ever doing. And then he did it for two weeks to the point where Threads

1715
01:41:37,325 --> 01:41:40,255
Speaker 6:  throttled him and wouldn't let him post for a whole day because they thought,

1716
01:41:40,255 --> 01:41:44,095
Speaker 6:  oh no, Threads thought he was harassing me. Aw. Oh no, he's allowed to post

1717
01:41:44,095 --> 01:41:47,335
Speaker 6:  again. But I just wanna say I hear you and thank you. And also please, no

1718
01:41:47,335 --> 01:41:48,535
Speaker 6:  one ever do that to me. Aw,

1719
01:41:50,445 --> 01:41:54,335
Speaker 4:  Very good. Very good site. Look great this week

1720
01:41:55,235 --> 01:41:58,695
Speaker 4:  you go read Sean's coverage of the trial, all sorts of other good stuff.

1721
01:41:58,875 --> 01:42:01,175
Speaker 6:  The Twitter package is amazing. Like truly Twitter package is amazing. If

1722
01:42:01,175 --> 01:42:04,975
Speaker 6:  you haven't been on the scroll back of Alexandria, I spent 90

1723
01:42:05,165 --> 01:42:09,135
Speaker 6:  full minutes just scrolling reading tweets and it is gig it the

1724
01:42:09,135 --> 01:42:10,735
