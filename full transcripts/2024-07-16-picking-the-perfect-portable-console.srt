00:00:02,605 --> 00:00:05,975
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Nose Bridge

3
00:00:05,975 --> 00:00:09,855
Speaker 2:  Microphones. I'm your friend David Pierce and I am sitting in

4
00:00:09,855 --> 00:00:13,815
Speaker 2:  my new bathroom. It's been almost a month since we've been

5
00:00:13,815 --> 00:00:17,135
Speaker 2:  doing this construction, and I'm sure you've heard me complain about

6
00:00:17,675 --> 00:00:21,575
Speaker 2:  all of the construction noise and chaos on the show over the last month.

7
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:25,495
Speaker 2:  I, you've probably even heard some of the noise and chaos on the show over

8
00:00:25,495 --> 00:00:28,655
Speaker 2:  the last month. So I'm sorry for all of my noise and chaos,

9
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:32,975
Speaker 2:  but it's done. It's not all the way done because as I've learned with a project

10
00:00:32,975 --> 00:00:36,295
Speaker 2:  like this, it's never all the way done. I can like see the paint touchups

11
00:00:36,355 --> 00:00:39,495
Speaker 2:  and everything that I have to do. You do one of these things and you're suddenly

12
00:00:39,525 --> 00:00:42,695
Speaker 2:  just very like aware of your surroundings in a way that is

13
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:46,415
Speaker 2:  honestly not helpful. I don't recommend it. It's better to just sort of live

14
00:00:46,415 --> 00:00:49,975
Speaker 2:  your life and not notice all the imperfections. But now I have a sink that

15
00:00:49,975 --> 00:00:53,695
Speaker 2:  works. We have a shower that works. We have a toilet that works. I have places

16
00:00:53,755 --> 00:00:57,495
Speaker 2:  to put things. It's all very exciting. And now honestly, given

17
00:00:57,715 --> 00:01:01,215
Speaker 2:  the amount of money and time and energy we've spent in this bathroom, it

18
00:01:01,215 --> 00:01:04,695
Speaker 2:  only feels right for me to just live in this bathroom. So this is my home

19
00:01:04,755 --> 00:01:08,655
Speaker 2:  now. I'm VERGE casting from the bathroom from now on. Anyway,

20
00:01:08,955 --> 00:01:12,015
Speaker 2:  we have a lot of stuff to do today, so let's dive into it. We're gonna do

21
00:01:12,275 --> 00:01:15,775
Speaker 2:  two things. First, we're gonna talk about a bit of a gaming

22
00:01:16,295 --> 00:01:20,175
Speaker 2:  hardware conundrum that I'm having, and we're gonna see if two of

23
00:01:20,175 --> 00:01:24,095
Speaker 2:  my colleagues can help me figure out how to upgrade my PS four and

24
00:01:24,095 --> 00:01:27,935
Speaker 2:  what I actually need to buy. Then we're gonna do a test of some

25
00:01:27,935 --> 00:01:31,535
Speaker 2:  new wearable microphones. We love doing mic tests on this show and we haven't

26
00:01:31,535 --> 00:01:35,335
Speaker 2:  done them with the glasses and headsets and all that

27
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:38,655
Speaker 2:  kind of stuff that is out there in the world in a big way. So we're gonna

28
00:01:38,655 --> 00:01:41,735
Speaker 2:  test some microphones and see how everybody sounds. We also have a really

29
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:45,655
Speaker 2:  fun glasses question from The Vergecast hotline. Lots to do, so

30
00:01:45,655 --> 00:01:49,615
Speaker 2:  let's get to it. All that is coming in just one second. But first

31
00:01:49,855 --> 00:01:53,295
Speaker 2:  I just, there's a grout line that I have to go fix and it's gonna drive me

32
00:01:53,295 --> 00:01:56,455
Speaker 2:  crazy if I don't do it. This is The Vergecast. We'll be right back.

33
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,075
Speaker 2:  so as I

34
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:58,395
Speaker 2:  that I can play for like 15 minutes at a go. And the challenge I've always

35
00:03:58,395 --> 00:04:02,115
Speaker 2:  had with a game like Elden Ring is I just wanna play it for hours.

36
00:04:02,335 --> 00:04:05,835
Speaker 2:  And I feel like it never rewards you for just a couple of minutes of playing

37
00:04:05,895 --> 00:04:09,635
Speaker 2:  at a time in a way that some of these more finite battle

38
00:04:09,815 --> 00:04:13,595
Speaker 2:  royale or like football game sized games really are.

39
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:17,875
Speaker 2:  So all of this is to say I'm pretty happy with my gaming setup.

40
00:04:18,075 --> 00:04:21,675
Speaker 2:  I haven't really felt the need to get a PS five or anything like that.

41
00:04:22,015 --> 00:04:25,715
Speaker 2:  I'm still on a PS four pro. It works fine, everything's great. But more recently

42
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:29,195
Speaker 2:  I want something new. We've been talking a lot about

43
00:04:29,315 --> 00:04:33,075
Speaker 2:  handheld consoles on this show over the last eight months or so,

44
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:37,235
Speaker 2:  I would say. And there's just a lot of cool stuff happening. I also

45
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:41,195
Speaker 2:  travel more than I used to and I'm back to wanting something

46
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:44,875
Speaker 2:  I can play on the train or on a plane or in a hotel room when I'm not

47
00:04:45,055 --> 00:04:48,915
Speaker 2:  at home. I also just spend too much time sitting at my desk. Like right now

48
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:53,315
Speaker 2:  I'm sitting at my desk, my monitor's in front of me, my computer is

49
00:04:53,315 --> 00:04:56,555
Speaker 2:  underneath it. I have a Mac mini that I use for most things. And then right

50
00:04:56,555 --> 00:05:00,435
Speaker 2:  off to the right is my PlayStation. And so having this one space

51
00:05:00,575 --> 00:05:03,835
Speaker 2:  be the place that I sit for work all day and then to play games at night,

52
00:05:04,075 --> 00:05:07,395
Speaker 2:  I just don't like it. And I want something that I can take and sit on the

53
00:05:07,395 --> 00:05:11,315
Speaker 2:  couch while I hang out with the dog or play out in the backyard when the

54
00:05:11,315 --> 00:05:14,995
Speaker 2:  weather's nice. So I'm really into the idea of a handheld console, but

55
00:05:15,195 --> 00:05:19,115
Speaker 2:  I have no idea which one to get. So I enlisted two people to help

56
00:05:19,115 --> 00:05:22,875
Speaker 2:  me figure it out. Sean Hollister and Alex Kranz, they both know this stuff

57
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:26,475
Speaker 2:  way better than I do. And to together we are going to make a decision

58
00:05:26,885 --> 00:05:30,355
Speaker 2:  about which handheld console I'm gonna buy. Let's get into it.

59
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:33,955
Speaker 2:  Alex Krantz. Hello in Texas. Howdy y'all.

60
00:05:35,425 --> 00:05:38,795
Speaker 2:  Well this is, this is what we're gonna do here. Sean Hollister. Hello.

61
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:41,955
Speaker 8:  Hi. From the land of Gambling handhelds,

62
00:05:42,195 --> 00:05:45,635
Speaker 2:  I have brought you here to do personal tech support for me because that is

63
00:05:45,635 --> 00:05:49,355
Speaker 2:  what the first cast is about, is helping David figure out which

64
00:05:49,355 --> 00:05:52,955
Speaker 2:  gadgets he should buy. Good. I'm going to lay out for you my current situation

65
00:05:53,335 --> 00:05:57,325
Speaker 2:  and then you are going to help me solve my current situation. So

66
00:05:57,325 --> 00:06:01,205
Speaker 2:  my current situation is I have a PlayStation four, I've had it for a million

67
00:06:01,205 --> 00:06:04,925
Speaker 2:  years. It's fine. It plays video games. I would like to

68
00:06:04,925 --> 00:06:08,765
Speaker 2:  upgrade, but I don't think what I want is a PS five. I think what I want

69
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:12,605
Speaker 2:  is something handheld and portable because my PS four

70
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:16,405
Speaker 2:  like lives next to my computer in my basement and I'm spending too much time

71
00:06:16,405 --> 00:06:19,605
Speaker 2:  sitting in this chair looking at this screen. And I would like to have something

72
00:06:19,605 --> 00:06:22,005
Speaker 2:  that can like go out in the world with me and I travel a lot and all these

73
00:06:22,005 --> 00:06:25,725
Speaker 2:  things. So I want something that is like primarily but not entirely

74
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:30,565
Speaker 2:  a portable handheld gadget. I would like to play

75
00:06:30,595 --> 00:06:34,405
Speaker 2:  lots of games. We can talk about which games I do and don't care about, but

76
00:06:34,405 --> 00:06:38,285
Speaker 2:  I have exactly one non-negotiable game, which is, which is fifa,

77
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:42,725
Speaker 2:  EA Sports FC is the new name of it. I will call it FIFA until the day I die.

78
00:06:43,325 --> 00:06:47,085
Speaker 2:  I play that game more than I play every other game combined and I need that

79
00:06:47,085 --> 00:06:50,925
Speaker 2:  game. That's it. That's literally like, that is the entirety of where I am

80
00:06:50,985 --> 00:06:54,525
Speaker 2:  and I wanna buy something and I want you to tell me what to buy.

81
00:06:55,185 --> 00:06:59,085
Speaker 8:  Why? Why is that your game? Why is that your game? Because I have an

82
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,765
Speaker 8:  answer for you, but the answer has just been foiled by the fact that you

83
00:07:02,765 --> 00:07:06,325
Speaker 8:  have picked a game which, and I quote runs a,

84
00:07:06,755 --> 00:07:10,605
Speaker 8:  this program encountered E 1 1 1 0 0 B during initialization.

85
00:07:10,675 --> 00:07:14,405
Speaker 8:  Okay. Error message when you try to run it on a steam deck.

86
00:07:14,945 --> 00:07:17,165
Speaker 8:  So I guess I'm not gonna tell you to buy a steam deck.

87
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:20,845
Speaker 2:  My worry was this is going to be the shortest VERGE cast in history because

88
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:23,525
Speaker 2:  I was gonna say all that and you were both gonna say Steam Deck and then

89
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:27,285
Speaker 2:  we were gonna hang up and move on with our lives if it were not for this

90
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:30,925
Speaker 2:  one game that I require. Is the world sort of that simple

91
00:07:31,105 --> 00:07:32,205
Speaker 2:  at this particular moment?

92
00:07:32,715 --> 00:07:33,005
Speaker 9:  Yeah,

93
00:07:33,545 --> 00:07:37,285
Speaker 8:  It kind of is. and it maybe it won't be in like, okay,

94
00:07:37,585 --> 00:07:41,485
Speaker 8:  two weeks in, in, in two weeks or so through, is it three weeks? There

95
00:07:41,485 --> 00:07:45,285
Speaker 8:  will be a Windows handheld with a battery that is bigger than any other

96
00:07:45,285 --> 00:07:48,965
Speaker 8:  handheld on the market. And maybe that will solve the issue of Windows handhelds

97
00:07:48,965 --> 00:07:49,885
Speaker 8:  don't have great battery life.

98
00:07:49,955 --> 00:07:52,565
Speaker 9:  That won't solve all the other problems with the Windows handheld.

99
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:57,325
Speaker 9:  I'm gonna say David, you're, you're, you know, you're on The Vergecast, so

100
00:07:57,365 --> 00:08:01,285
Speaker 9:  I feel very comfortable saying you like to tinker, you enjoy

101
00:08:01,325 --> 00:08:02,565
Speaker 9:  a little tinkering. So

102
00:08:02,605 --> 00:08:06,165
Speaker 2:  I, I do, when I don't, I will say what I'm, I am willing to tinker.

103
00:08:06,725 --> 00:08:10,565
Speaker 2:  Like if it, if it's a matter of I need to like buy this thing and spend a

104
00:08:10,565 --> 00:08:13,605
Speaker 2:  couple of hours like downloading and tweaking and doing whatever I need to

105
00:08:13,605 --> 00:08:17,445
Speaker 2:  get it set up fine. I am not buying a

106
00:08:17,445 --> 00:08:21,245
Speaker 2:  thing with the intention of screwing with it forever. I would like this thing

107
00:08:21,245 --> 00:08:24,925
Speaker 2:  to play video games and I want to be able to sit down on my couch and be

108
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:28,325
Speaker 2:  playing video games as quickly as possible. That's actually very important

109
00:08:28,325 --> 00:08:28,605
Speaker 2:  to me.

110
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:32,965
Speaker 8:  Would you spend those two hours, hear me out? Would you spend

111
00:08:32,965 --> 00:08:36,605
Speaker 8:  those two hours setting up your steam deck to dual

112
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:40,085
Speaker 8:  boots windows off of an SD card?

113
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:44,405
Speaker 8:  Occasionally with the one non-negotiable game that apparently you

114
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:44,845
Speaker 8:  must have

115
00:08:45,145 --> 00:08:49,045
Speaker 9:  You can get FIFA on the steam deck without doing dual boot? I was,

116
00:08:49,205 --> 00:08:50,605
Speaker 9:  I was looking this up.

117
00:08:51,075 --> 00:08:51,725
Speaker 2:  Tell me more.

118
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:56,685
Speaker 9:  You will need to be comfortable diving

119
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,605
Speaker 9:  into the Linux side of Steam deck.

120
00:08:58,995 --> 00:08:59,285
Speaker 2:  Okay.

121
00:08:59,425 --> 00:09:02,885
Speaker 9:  And do some tweaking. And also does it have to be

122
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:04,845
Speaker 9:  FIFA 24?

123
00:09:05,465 --> 00:09:05,685
Speaker 2:  Yes.

124
00:09:06,305 --> 00:09:09,005
Speaker 9:  Oh, it can't can't be FIFA 23. Well

125
00:09:09,005 --> 00:09:12,405
Speaker 2:  No, it actually, it, what's important is that it's going to be 25 in like

126
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,245
Speaker 2:  six weeks and it's actually what I need is that one.

127
00:09:15,585 --> 00:09:18,925
Speaker 8:  Do you have to play it online? Because it's the anti sheet That's, that's

128
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:22,845
Speaker 8:  the problem here. Ea insisting on its own version of Anti Sheet instead of

129
00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:24,445
Speaker 8:  the ones that actually work on the steam deck.

130
00:09:24,795 --> 00:09:26,485
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I need to be online. Shit.

131
00:09:26,635 --> 00:09:26,925
Speaker 8:  Well

132
00:09:27,765 --> 00:09:31,005
Speaker 9:  I feel like the other FIFA games have appeared in Xbox Cloud

133
00:09:31,585 --> 00:09:34,165
Speaker 9:  and I feel like this one would also appear in Xbox Cloud.

134
00:09:34,315 --> 00:09:35,805
Speaker 8:  That was my next thought. You

135
00:09:35,805 --> 00:09:38,245
Speaker 2:  Make a very good point here, which is a thing that I should have said. I

136
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,965
Speaker 2:  don't need to be able to play this game on the first day that it is available.

137
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:44,725
Speaker 2:  Okay. I just need to play it at some point. Yeah. And what I have discovered

138
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:47,685
Speaker 2:  about the video game world is that those things are, are very different.

139
00:09:47,685 --> 00:09:51,445
Speaker 2:  Like when things come to Game Pass and there's stuff that comes to PlayStations

140
00:09:51,495 --> 00:09:55,485
Speaker 2:  Cloud stuff later on that isn't there, like day and date when

141
00:09:55,485 --> 00:09:58,325
Speaker 2:  they release, like the reason I picked this game that matters is because

142
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:02,525
Speaker 2:  I, I can just like get lost down this impossible universe with any game that

143
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:05,485
Speaker 2:  I want. And it's all very complicated. But just, just to tie off the one

144
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:09,165
Speaker 2:  piece of this, if, if all I was saying is I want a handheld thing to

145
00:10:09,365 --> 00:10:13,125
Speaker 2:  play games on and I did not give you any specific games Yeah. Is the answer

146
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,725
Speaker 2:  like the steam deck and it's not even close?

147
00:10:15,355 --> 00:10:18,685
Speaker 8:  Yeah, it really is. It really is. The steam deck.

148
00:10:19,305 --> 00:10:23,285
Speaker 8:  We, we we're in this moment where all of these other

149
00:10:23,765 --> 00:10:26,805
Speaker 8:  companies are like, we want a piece of that steam deck action, but we're

150
00:10:26,805 --> 00:10:30,565
Speaker 8:  gonna build it on Windows because gamers tell us that Windows is

151
00:10:30,565 --> 00:10:33,765
Speaker 8:  where all of the games are and they want to just be able to play the games

152
00:10:33,765 --> 00:10:35,285
Speaker 8:  they already own. Which

153
00:10:35,285 --> 00:10:35,605
Speaker 9:  Is true.

154
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:39,445
Speaker 8:  Which is true. But the reality is that the Steam deck

155
00:10:39,615 --> 00:10:43,005
Speaker 8:  plays Windows games and it plays more of them

156
00:10:43,345 --> 00:10:46,885
Speaker 8:  better than a native Windows system plays Windows games.

157
00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:49,925
Speaker 2:  What is the problem with the native Windows system? Because

158
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:54,445
Speaker 9:  Windows is built for computers for laptops and, and

159
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:58,325
Speaker 9:  desktops and things that you use with a mouse and a at least 13 inch

160
00:10:58,395 --> 00:11:01,765
Speaker 9:  display. And then you put that on a seven inch display

161
00:11:02,225 --> 00:11:04,565
Speaker 9:  and instead of a mouse you have a joystick.

162
00:11:05,195 --> 00:11:08,885
Speaker 2:  Okay, that sounds awful. Now that I'm thinking this through, that sounds

163
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:09,685
Speaker 2:  like a nightmare.

164
00:11:09,995 --> 00:11:13,805
Speaker 8:  That part's kind of a You can, if you wanna spend your two hours of setup,

165
00:11:14,225 --> 00:11:17,965
Speaker 8:  You can certainly spend 10 minutes of them setting up steam

166
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:21,405
Speaker 8:  to launch every time you launch your Windows computer, enter launch right

167
00:11:21,405 --> 00:11:24,965
Speaker 8:  into big picture mode. And then you have an interface that's similar to the

168
00:11:24,965 --> 00:11:28,445
Speaker 8:  steam deck, but it doesn't have the ability to like

169
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:32,725
Speaker 8:  tweak the handheld very easily so that you get great battery life. The

170
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:35,085
Speaker 8:  chips won't give you great battery life to begin with. 'cause there's all

171
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:38,565
Speaker 8:  that other overhead for all the other shit you don't need in Windows. Sometimes

172
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:42,285
Speaker 8:  you'll turn off your Windows system, you'll, you'll put it to sleep and you'll

173
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:45,285
Speaker 8:  turn it back on again and wake it up again and all of a sudden your app will

174
00:11:45,285 --> 00:11:48,085
Speaker 8:  be gone. And where did it go? I wonder why it isn't full screen anymore.

175
00:11:48,085 --> 00:11:52,005
Speaker 8:  It's this tiny icon on the Windows taskbar that's not great. Sometimes it

176
00:11:52,005 --> 00:11:54,725
Speaker 8:  won't wake up from sleep, it'll have restarted itself.

177
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:58,845
Speaker 2:  I'm having like netbook flashbacks to 10 years ago as you're describing

178
00:11:58,845 --> 00:11:59,085
Speaker 2:  this,

179
00:11:59,355 --> 00:12:03,085
Speaker 9:  Sometimes for some reason I can't get it to stop asking for the password

180
00:12:03,475 --> 00:12:07,285
Speaker 9:  when I open one of my Windows game consoles. And so then I have to like figure

181
00:12:07,285 --> 00:12:11,125
Speaker 9:  out how to get the, the accessibility keyboard up, which always

182
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:15,085
Speaker 9:  takes at least five minutes and then very carefully type

183
00:12:15,085 --> 00:12:18,365
Speaker 9:  in the password, which is super long because I like to be safe.

184
00:12:18,995 --> 00:12:21,525
Speaker 9:  It's, it's my favorite thing to do, David, you don't wanna do that.

185
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:25,645
Speaker 2:  This is not the most compelling case you've ever made, Alex. But wait, Sean,

186
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:29,525
Speaker 2:  you, you alluded to maybe there is something coming that solves this problem

187
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,605
Speaker 2:  for me. Okay.

188
00:12:31,025 --> 00:12:33,645
Speaker 8:  Not most of these problems. Okay. But, but the but the battery life. Okay,

189
00:12:33,645 --> 00:12:37,325
Speaker 8:  the battery life problem, as with the rug ally, the

190
00:12:37,405 --> 00:12:41,325
Speaker 8:  ROG ally, they're, they're gonna, they're gonna hop on me. So the ROG ally

191
00:12:41,355 --> 00:12:45,325
Speaker 8:  came out a year ago as like a steam dick, but

192
00:12:45,415 --> 00:12:49,405
Speaker 8:  worse in almost every way except that it had a better screen,

193
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:52,325
Speaker 8:  a variable refresh rate screen. It has since been surpassed by the Steam

194
00:12:52,325 --> 00:12:55,325
Speaker 8:  deck oled, which has an OLED screen that goes 90 hertz. I'm gonna stop getting

195
00:12:55,325 --> 00:12:58,965
Speaker 8:  into the weeds, but they're coming out with a new version of that

196
00:12:59,055 --> 00:13:02,805
Speaker 8:  later this month that will have a doubled battery in it

197
00:13:03,105 --> 00:13:06,405
Speaker 8:  and all kinds of other creature comforts. It'll be more comfortable to hold

198
00:13:07,665 --> 00:13:11,565
Speaker 8:  in the year since they shipped the original ROG ally, the

199
00:13:11,785 --> 00:13:15,645
Speaker 8:  UI hass gotten a little bit better. It's smoother. Like Tom

200
00:13:15,645 --> 00:13:19,565
Speaker 8:  Warren likes his, I think he might prefer that over the steam deck. He

201
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,245
Speaker 8:  is a notorious Windows fan boy.

202
00:13:21,445 --> 00:13:22,605
Speaker 9:  That's why he doesn't count.

203
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:26,565
Speaker 8:  I I think it's going to be very possibly the first Windows

204
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:30,725
Speaker 8:  handheld that I can recommend because they've gotten so many

205
00:13:30,725 --> 00:13:34,445
Speaker 8:  things right. but it fundamentally still runs Windows and

206
00:13:34,765 --> 00:13:38,645
Speaker 8:  Microsoft has not improved Windows in any meaningful way in the year

207
00:13:38,665 --> 00:13:40,565
Speaker 8:  and a half, two years since Steam Deck came out.

208
00:13:40,835 --> 00:13:44,365
Speaker 9:  They could though, right? Like, like we've been hearing a lot of rumors that

209
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,085
Speaker 9:  they're gonna introduce some sort of Xbox handheld in the next couple of

210
00:13:47,085 --> 00:13:50,925
Speaker 9:  years that'll very likely run on Windows because technically the Xbox

211
00:13:50,925 --> 00:13:54,365
Speaker 9:  runs on that. There's like the opportunity, I feel like a lot like

212
00:13:55,045 --> 00:13:58,805
Speaker 9:  remember when a MD was having its big resurgence. Nvidia was the game

213
00:13:59,365 --> 00:14:03,205
Speaker 9:  GPU and then a MD was like, we're gonna start doing this again. And the

214
00:14:03,205 --> 00:14:07,005
Speaker 9:  difference was Nvidia actually did software and made the games

215
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:09,885
Speaker 9:  work really, really well. Whereas a MD didn't for at least a year or two.

216
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:13,965
Speaker 9:  Yeah. That's where the Windows handhelds are. No one's done those really

217
00:14:14,035 --> 00:14:17,405
Speaker 9:  important software tweaks. So the Steam Deck wasn better, but

218
00:14:17,605 --> 00:14:20,765
Speaker 8:  Microsoft would have to be like, we're gonna ship a different OS on it. We're

219
00:14:20,765 --> 00:14:23,845
Speaker 8:  gonna ship conversion to Windows that's so stripped down. You don't recognize

220
00:14:23,845 --> 00:14:25,205
Speaker 8:  it as Windows anymore. Look,

221
00:14:25,385 --> 00:14:28,405
Speaker 9:  If it opens ea origins then the like I'm fine.

222
00:14:28,925 --> 00:14:32,565
Speaker 8:  EA is one of the achilles of the steam deck you brought up fifa. fifa

223
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:36,805
Speaker 8:  EA games will notoriously, particularly if you need online, they will just

224
00:14:37,175 --> 00:14:40,925
Speaker 8:  break on Steam deck because EA does not give a shit about

225
00:14:41,065 --> 00:14:44,765
Speaker 8:  valves handheld, and they'll just like change their stupid mandatory like

226
00:14:44,845 --> 00:14:48,405
Speaker 8:  DRM app all the time. Used to be called Origin. Now it's like EA app and

227
00:14:48,405 --> 00:14:51,165
Speaker 8:  games will just break there on Steam deck. But everything else works pretty

228
00:14:51,165 --> 00:14:51,365
Speaker 8:  good.

229
00:14:51,505 --> 00:14:54,445
Speaker 9:  But they do participate in cloud gaming. They're, they, they, most of their

230
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:58,285
Speaker 9:  stuff is available on the various cloud gaming platforms and all of those

231
00:14:58,285 --> 00:15:01,485
Speaker 9:  work on the steam deck and You can get 'em up and running pretty quickly

232
00:15:02,065 --> 00:15:05,445
Speaker 9:  and then not have to like constantly go into the Linux backend to tweak 'em.

233
00:15:05,475 --> 00:15:06,885
Speaker 9:  Just the one time meaning

234
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:10,245
Speaker 2:  Like I could do like steam deck plus

235
00:15:10,595 --> 00:15:12,605
Speaker 2:  game pass and solve my problem.

236
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:13,165
Speaker 8:  Yes.

237
00:15:13,425 --> 00:15:14,605
Speaker 2:  Is is this a good idea?

238
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:17,525
Speaker 9:  Yeah, you could do that. Okay. You can even, you could stream your, your

239
00:15:17,755 --> 00:15:21,725
Speaker 9:  Sony PS four from there so you don't have to like sit in front of it to play

240
00:15:21,725 --> 00:15:22,925
Speaker 9:  the last of us. Oh

241
00:15:22,925 --> 00:15:26,765
Speaker 8:  Yeah. You can stream your Xbox and your PlayStation and cloud

242
00:15:27,345 --> 00:15:29,005
Speaker 8:  to the steam deck. It does all these things.

243
00:15:29,385 --> 00:15:32,805
Speaker 2:  I'm glad you brought this up because this is, this is a, a thing I have deeply

244
00:15:33,285 --> 00:15:36,445
Speaker 2:  investigated and have come up with is a, is just a terrible nightmare that

245
00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:40,405
Speaker 2:  I will not subject myself to. There are, there are things about

246
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:44,285
Speaker 2:  remote streaming your own console that are really great and they

247
00:15:44,355 --> 00:15:48,325
Speaker 2:  immediately fall apart as soon as you get anywhere outside of your

248
00:15:48,325 --> 00:15:49,685
Speaker 2:  house. Like it just doesn't. Yeah. Oh yeah.

249
00:15:49,745 --> 00:15:51,605
Speaker 8:  Do you, do you need to play FIFA outside your house?

250
00:15:51,925 --> 00:15:55,645
Speaker 2:  I do. Like, for me, honestly. Okay. The, the two biggest things

251
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:59,445
Speaker 2:  I'm trying to solve in switching from this console on my desk to

252
00:15:59,745 --> 00:16:03,005
Speaker 2:  the handheld is I wanna play other places in my house than at this desk,

253
00:16:03,215 --> 00:16:07,165
Speaker 2:  which is a victory for console streaming. And I wanna play when

254
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:10,325
Speaker 2:  I travel in part because I'm addicted to this game. And it's set up in such

255
00:16:10,325 --> 00:16:12,645
Speaker 2:  a way that the mechanics are, if you don't play every day, it's actually

256
00:16:12,645 --> 00:16:15,805
Speaker 2:  kind of like, it's a real problem as I'm describing this. But this is where

257
00:16:15,805 --> 00:16:19,645
Speaker 2:  I'm at in life and the console streaming thing is great for the first

258
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:23,565
Speaker 2:  thing. Like I can, I can sit upstairs on my couch and play my

259
00:16:23,905 --> 00:16:27,805
Speaker 2:  PS four on like an iPad and it actually works passively well, total

260
00:16:27,995 --> 00:16:31,685
Speaker 2:  non-starter trying to stream any stuff over the internet. I just,

261
00:16:31,755 --> 00:16:32,725
Speaker 2:  it's just not even worth it.

262
00:16:32,915 --> 00:16:35,605
Speaker 8:  This goes for all streaming. Yeah, I agree with that. All streaming breaks

263
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:39,285
Speaker 8:  down once you leave your house because you no longer have control over making

264
00:16:39,285 --> 00:16:42,885
Speaker 8:  sure you have a good internet connection. If you're out there like on 5G,

265
00:16:43,145 --> 00:16:46,845
Speaker 8:  if you have a great 5G signal and nobody else in the node is using it right

266
00:16:46,845 --> 00:16:49,925
Speaker 8:  then, yeah, You can have a great streaming experience. But I, I would sit,

267
00:16:50,045 --> 00:16:53,925
Speaker 8:  I would sit in, you know, a hospital waiting room or out in a cafe and

268
00:16:53,945 --> 00:16:57,005
Speaker 8:  I'd be using that, that Razer device, which could only really do cloud streaming.

269
00:16:57,465 --> 00:17:01,325
Speaker 8:  And I would have a beautiful streaming experience that would drop

270
00:17:01,325 --> 00:17:04,765
Speaker 8:  out five minutes later and be completely unplayable over and over and over

271
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:08,645
Speaker 8:  again. I had that experience with cloud gaming with a good cloud gaming

272
00:17:08,645 --> 00:17:12,445
Speaker 8:  service like GForce. Now great service. This connection would not maintain

273
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:15,125
Speaker 8:  that. Now if you're talking about going over to a friend's house who, which

274
00:17:15,315 --> 00:17:19,245
Speaker 8:  your friend also has amazing internet at home and you wanna stream from

275
00:17:19,315 --> 00:17:22,125
Speaker 8:  Xbox Cloud there. Great. That, that could, that could, that could work great.

276
00:17:22,525 --> 00:17:26,005
Speaker 9:  I was just assuming that David has like a hotspot with him at all time. That

277
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:29,005
Speaker 9:  gives him brilliant internet like 90% of the time,

278
00:17:29,385 --> 00:17:33,365
Speaker 2:  To be honest, I do a lot. Yes. It's called, it's called an iPad Pro with

279
00:17:33,365 --> 00:17:36,965
Speaker 2:  Cell Connection and it's actually like an unbelievably great hotspot. The

280
00:17:36,965 --> 00:17:40,645
Speaker 2:  problem is, I'll give you the worst case scenario for my own

281
00:17:40,745 --> 00:17:44,565
Speaker 2:  gaming usage is on an Amtrak train from DC

282
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,685
Speaker 2:  to New York. No. And at that point, realistically what I need is games I

283
00:17:47,685 --> 00:17:51,565
Speaker 2:  can play offline. Right. Which I, I think just rules out full reliance

284
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:54,845
Speaker 2:  on game streaming services. Like I actually, this is why I'm, I'm compelled

285
00:17:54,845 --> 00:17:58,805
Speaker 2:  by the combination of Steam Deck and Game Pass. Like I,

286
00:17:58,925 --> 00:18:02,685
Speaker 2:  I can do mostly online stuff and like I have, I, I don't need to be able

287
00:18:02,685 --> 00:18:06,005
Speaker 2:  to play FIFA online while I'm on Amtrak wifi. That's like not possible in

288
00:18:06,005 --> 00:18:09,725
Speaker 2:  the world that we live in. So I'm fine with that, but I need to be able to

289
00:18:09,725 --> 00:18:13,205
Speaker 2:  do something on that thing when I have crappy connection and the idea of

290
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:16,965
Speaker 2:  just having like a brick in my hands when the wifi is bad feels

291
00:18:17,385 --> 00:18:17,605
Speaker 2:  bad.

292
00:18:18,405 --> 00:18:22,325
Speaker 9:  I do have one other suggestion and it is actually even more

293
00:18:22,325 --> 00:18:25,045
Speaker 9:  basic than the steam deck and it's a switch.

294
00:18:25,445 --> 00:18:26,885
Speaker 2:  I I'm glad you brought this up.

295
00:18:27,635 --> 00:18:31,005
Speaker 9:  It's, yes, it's like the steam deck gives you all of the

296
00:18:31,005 --> 00:18:34,845
Speaker 9:  customization and gives you, it's like a Swiss Army knife. The switch is

297
00:18:34,845 --> 00:18:38,805
Speaker 9:  like just a really good K bar. Like it's good for one thing and

298
00:18:38,805 --> 00:18:41,805
Speaker 9:  that's playing the games that Nintendo is okay with you playing on it. And

299
00:18:41,825 --> 00:18:45,605
Speaker 2:  One of those games is, is EA Sports FC 24,

300
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:48,445
Speaker 2:  the dumbest name game in soccer. But you're

301
00:18:48,445 --> 00:18:50,925
Speaker 8:  Still not gonna play it online on Amtrak, right? No,

302
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:54,885
Speaker 2:  But so I I have almost landed there except, and, and Kranz I'm glad you

303
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:58,125
Speaker 2:  brought this up because I wanna know what you guys think right now feels

304
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:02,085
Speaker 2:  like a stupid time to buy a switch. It feels like the end of a switch cycle.

305
00:19:02,155 --> 00:19:05,885
Speaker 2:  They have already talked about the next one, like the switch by all

306
00:19:05,885 --> 00:19:08,605
Speaker 2:  accounts is still very good, but this feels like a ridiculous time to buy

307
00:19:08,725 --> 00:19:09,085
Speaker 2:  a switch.

308
00:19:09,505 --> 00:19:13,325
Speaker 8:  It is absolutely the end of the switch cycle. They're they're, they're delaying

309
00:19:13,325 --> 00:19:15,725
Speaker 8:  it a little bit. They're not like, they don't want to come out right away

310
00:19:15,725 --> 00:19:19,325
Speaker 8:  and do switch tube. They're biting their time probably 'cause they want to

311
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,925
Speaker 8:  get some great software lined up for it. And I imagine that

312
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:27,045
Speaker 8:  that software, if you wanna play a metro prime for or whatever the

313
00:19:27,045 --> 00:19:30,725
Speaker 8:  next game is, the Nintendo does, it probably won't work as well

314
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:34,125
Speaker 8:  on the current switch. 'cause the current switch is not only seven years

315
00:19:34,225 --> 00:19:38,205
Speaker 8:  old in terms of its processing power, but also was

316
00:19:38,235 --> 00:19:42,045
Speaker 8:  already weak to begin with. Like when you played Zelda

317
00:19:42,185 --> 00:19:45,925
Speaker 8:  breath of the wild on day one on the switch and you go to the, the forest

318
00:19:45,925 --> 00:19:49,765
Speaker 8:  where the master sword is like, it's choppy. It was choppy then

319
00:19:49,945 --> 00:19:51,685
Speaker 8:  it was choppy seven years ago. You know,

320
00:19:52,045 --> 00:19:55,445
Speaker 9:  I was like, FIFA will look like a bunch of potatoes are on a big green field.

321
00:19:55,865 --> 00:19:58,965
Speaker 9:  But, but you'll be, but you'll know what those potatoes are and you'll be

322
00:19:59,085 --> 00:20:03,045
Speaker 9:  able to control all the little potatoes. So like if the control of the

323
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:07,165
Speaker 9:  potatoes is important and not how they look, the switch could be an

324
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:10,165
Speaker 9:  option. 'cause there's a lot of good deals right now because there's a ton

325
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:13,885
Speaker 9:  of different ones. Like I, I just recently picked up the, the new Zelda one

326
00:20:13,915 --> 00:20:17,205
Speaker 9:  because somebody left it on a plane and I bought it at a thrift store.

327
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:19,325
Speaker 8:  Have you played the news Ilda yet?

328
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:23,245
Speaker 2:  I have. So I actually have an OG switch and it

329
00:20:23,245 --> 00:20:26,405
Speaker 2:  worked great and I loved it very much. And then it got to the point where

330
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:30,285
Speaker 2:  literally the battery lasts like six minutes. Mm. Like it's, it's

331
00:20:30,285 --> 00:20:33,565
Speaker 2:  fine. The thing is seven years old, I got a lot of love out of it. I used

332
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:37,285
Speaker 2:  it for a long time and it just basically doesn't work anymore. And so now

333
00:20:37,285 --> 00:20:39,445
Speaker 2:  it's just like a pretty yellow thing that sits over there.

334
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:42,885
Speaker 8:  Do not trade that in because if it's an original switch that the battery

335
00:20:42,885 --> 00:20:46,405
Speaker 8:  is six minutes, it also means that it is hackable and You can do fun things

336
00:20:46,405 --> 00:20:48,085
Speaker 8:  with it and it is worth money. Okay. So

337
00:20:48,365 --> 00:20:52,245
Speaker 2:  I deal, okay, well that's David's side business in selling

338
00:20:52,305 --> 00:20:55,485
Speaker 2:  old gadgets is is a whole nother thing you and I should do on this show,

339
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:59,405
Speaker 2:  Sean. So yeah, so I think one of the outcomes I'm afraid

340
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:03,405
Speaker 2:  of is that the answer is just wait a year because there's gonna be

341
00:21:03,405 --> 00:21:06,045
Speaker 2:  a new switch and they might fix windows and maybe we'll get the Xbox thing.

342
00:21:06,045 --> 00:21:09,365
Speaker 2:  and it feels like in a weird way, we're in like a bad middle zone between

343
00:21:09,475 --> 00:21:10,005
Speaker 2:  good things.

344
00:21:10,705 --> 00:21:14,645
Speaker 9:  No, you need to get the steam deck with Ola and just be done and happy.

345
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:15,245
Speaker 9:  I

346
00:21:15,245 --> 00:21:18,805
Speaker 8:  Think what you need to do is you need to unlock, you need to unlock

347
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:22,885
Speaker 8:  a mountain of amazing PC games you've been missing that are

348
00:21:22,885 --> 00:21:26,725
Speaker 8:  incredibly cheap and brilliant and beautiful and

349
00:21:26,865 --> 00:21:29,685
Speaker 8:  rut on this handheld with an amazing screen. That's what you need to do.

350
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:31,165
Speaker 9:  And it's also hackable,

351
00:21:31,515 --> 00:21:35,285
Speaker 2:  Sean, I gave you one game, one game that I need to play

352
00:21:35,505 --> 00:21:38,605
Speaker 2:  and you're telling me that I can have everything I want except the one game

353
00:21:38,605 --> 00:21:39,605
Speaker 2:  that I need to play.

354
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,245
Speaker 8:  If you wanna play Fortnite on there, it doesn't do that either. So unless

355
00:21:43,245 --> 00:21:44,485
Speaker 8:  you're gonna stream that, I

356
00:21:44,485 --> 00:21:47,605
Speaker 2:  Literally, I almost wrote down that the two games were Fortnite and fifa

357
00:21:47,605 --> 00:21:50,965
Speaker 2:  and I decided I could live without Fortnite because there are other good,

358
00:21:51,735 --> 00:21:54,885
Speaker 2:  David has an hour to kill Battle Royal games out there. I could, I could

359
00:21:54,885 --> 00:21:56,805
Speaker 2:  take or leave Fortnite at this point in my life. I

360
00:21:56,805 --> 00:21:57,805
Speaker 9:  Was like, You can just use your iPad.

361
00:21:58,035 --> 00:22:01,565
Speaker 2:  That is, that is true. So let me float another idea by you,

362
00:22:01,935 --> 00:22:05,925
Speaker 2:  which is that I, instead of buying one thing, I buy several

363
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:09,845
Speaker 2:  things and, and I just yes, acknowledge that

364
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:13,805
Speaker 2:  at least for this next phase of my life, the right thing to do is get

365
00:22:14,325 --> 00:22:17,925
Speaker 2:  a PS five and a PS portal for my house

366
00:22:17,925 --> 00:22:21,365
Speaker 2:  projects and then I get a steam deck for travel.

367
00:22:21,845 --> 00:22:25,805
Speaker 2:  I have just quadrupled the amount of money that this is costing. Is this

368
00:22:25,805 --> 00:22:26,365
Speaker 2:  the outcome?

369
00:22:26,935 --> 00:22:30,685
Speaker 9:  Don't do that. Save your money. Just get like,

370
00:22:31,095 --> 00:22:35,085
Speaker 9:  never ever, ever, ever, ever buy a portal unless you

371
00:22:35,085 --> 00:22:38,925
Speaker 9:  just have zero computer skills. If you

372
00:22:38,925 --> 00:22:42,725
Speaker 9:  have none whatsoever. If all you do, if you like, struggle to turn

373
00:22:42,725 --> 00:22:45,005
Speaker 9:  your phone on, get the PSP portal. People

374
00:22:45,035 --> 00:22:48,725
Speaker 8:  Love the portal there, there are people who love the portal. It is selling

375
00:22:48,865 --> 00:22:52,605
Speaker 8:  really well. I would never touch one except to like

376
00:22:53,025 --> 00:22:56,765
Speaker 8:  to have the knowledge of having touched one because the steam deck

377
00:22:57,225 --> 00:23:01,205
Speaker 8:  has an app on it. And the app is the PS portal. Yeah. That's in an app for

378
00:23:01,205 --> 00:23:04,845
Speaker 8:  your steam deck. Yeah, basically it's, it's called chiaki

379
00:23:04,985 --> 00:23:08,165
Speaker 8:  chiaki for deck and it, and it works great. Just make sure your PS five,

380
00:23:08,165 --> 00:23:10,845
Speaker 8:  your PS four has an ethernet cable plugged into it or it will not work very

381
00:23:10,845 --> 00:23:10,965
Speaker 8:  well.

382
00:23:11,075 --> 00:23:11,925
Speaker 2:  Okay. Don't

383
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:15,685
Speaker 9:  Get the PS portal because that is, that's for like, that's for people who

384
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:19,205
Speaker 9:  love to game and don't have a lot of computer skills and so they're like,

385
00:23:19,205 --> 00:23:23,085
Speaker 9:  okay, I just need to go play right now. And that's great,

386
00:23:23,225 --> 00:23:26,845
Speaker 9:  but like you spend a little bit more money, you get the steam deck, you spend

387
00:23:26,845 --> 00:23:30,125
Speaker 9:  a little extra time and you have just way more capability. Okay.

388
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:34,085
Speaker 2:  So, alright, so let me, let me play out this scenario. So what's

389
00:23:34,085 --> 00:23:37,965
Speaker 2:  happening here is I, I'm going to make

390
00:23:37,965 --> 00:23:41,725
Speaker 2:  sure that my PlayStation streaming setup is as good as

391
00:23:41,925 --> 00:23:45,725
Speaker 2:  possible. I'm going to make sure that I have an ethernet port. I'm gonna,

392
00:23:45,785 --> 00:23:49,645
Speaker 2:  I'm gonna plug my PlayStation into the Euro gateway and not the

393
00:23:49,645 --> 00:23:53,365
Speaker 2:  euro in the basement. I'm gonna, I'm gonna make sure that my internet

394
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:57,085
Speaker 2:  connection for my PlayStation is as good as possible. TBD on whether

395
00:23:57,085 --> 00:24:00,045
Speaker 2:  that's gonna be a PS four or PS five, we're gonna see how poor I feel at

396
00:24:00,045 --> 00:24:03,605
Speaker 2:  the end of this episode, but that, that essentially becomes my like,

397
00:24:03,605 --> 00:24:07,205
Speaker 2:  dedicated FIFA machine, which is an absurd place to have landed. But

398
00:24:07,535 --> 00:24:08,485
Speaker 2:  again, here we are.

399
00:24:08,585 --> 00:24:10,605
Speaker 8:  If you've already got the PS four, I mean, why not?

400
00:24:10,945 --> 00:24:14,605
Speaker 2:  So that I'm, I'm relegating this thing to being my FIFA machine and then

401
00:24:15,145 --> 00:24:18,925
Speaker 2:  I'm going to download the app you just said for the steam deck for when I

402
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:22,325
Speaker 2:  wanna play FIFA and I'm gonna play FIFA on the steam deck through my PlayStation,

403
00:24:22,325 --> 00:24:26,005
Speaker 2:  which seems ludicrous, but you're telling me will kind of sort of work. As

404
00:24:26,005 --> 00:24:27,125
Speaker 2:  long as I have very good internet,

405
00:24:27,255 --> 00:24:27,885
Speaker 9:  It'll work great

406
00:24:28,105 --> 00:24:31,845
Speaker 8:  Inside your house. Remote is theoretically possible, but you'll play it in

407
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:32,925
Speaker 8:  your house realistically.

408
00:24:33,145 --> 00:24:36,925
Speaker 2:  So I've, I've, that's my solution to the, how do I play on my couch instead

409
00:24:36,925 --> 00:24:40,445
Speaker 2:  of in the basement problem. Great. For everything else,

410
00:24:40,945 --> 00:24:44,485
Speaker 2:  I'm just going to broaden my horizons and play less FIFA and play more other

411
00:24:44,485 --> 00:24:46,965
Speaker 2:  games. Is this what you're telling me? This is, this is where I need to land.

412
00:24:47,565 --> 00:24:51,525
Speaker 9:  I, I feel like You can find a really good FIFA clone, but like they all

413
00:24:51,525 --> 00:24:55,205
Speaker 9:  have swords or something. I like, I feel like this exists.

414
00:24:55,205 --> 00:24:57,605
Speaker 9:  Someone's made this game an alpha. So

415
00:24:58,035 --> 00:25:01,405
Speaker 2:  What is ironically possible is that because

416
00:25:01,965 --> 00:25:05,525
Speaker 2:  EA Sports FC is no longer called fifa, somebody else is making a FIFA game

417
00:25:05,525 --> 00:25:08,285
Speaker 2:  and maybe that FIFA game will be on the steam deck, which will solve all

418
00:25:08,285 --> 00:25:11,685
Speaker 2:  of my problems all at once. This is, this is what I'm hoping for done

419
00:25:11,865 --> 00:25:15,085
Speaker 8:  And also you'll write about this experience hopefully for The Verge and then

420
00:25:15,445 --> 00:25:18,405
Speaker 8:  EA will start taking care of its shit. Okay,

421
00:25:18,405 --> 00:25:22,205
Speaker 2:  So ea very large company makes a lot of very popular games. Is there any

422
00:25:22,205 --> 00:25:25,485
Speaker 2:  hope for EA on the steam deck ever? Like should I have any optimism for that

423
00:25:25,485 --> 00:25:28,205
Speaker 2:  to be a thing? The steam deck's very popular. What are we doing here?

424
00:25:28,275 --> 00:25:31,765
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I mean they just, they just break things willy-nilly and they don't

425
00:25:31,765 --> 00:25:33,765
Speaker 8:  think about it. It's not like they don't want money. Yeah.

426
00:25:33,885 --> 00:25:37,645
Speaker 9:  E ea is like kind of notorious for being one of the

427
00:25:37,645 --> 00:25:41,445
Speaker 9:  worst companies in the United States. Like I think when Consumerist existed

428
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:45,085
Speaker 9:  it was regularly beating cable companies Oh boy. For being the worst

429
00:25:45,475 --> 00:25:49,045
Speaker 9:  because they just, they, they put money ahead of

430
00:25:49,045 --> 00:25:53,005
Speaker 9:  usability frequently and so they could fix it, but I don't think they have

431
00:25:53,005 --> 00:25:56,285
Speaker 9:  a whole lot of interest because most of their players, the bulk of their

432
00:25:56,565 --> 00:26:00,165
Speaker 9:  audience is not, is, you know, it's on the switch. It's on the, the PlayStation.

433
00:26:00,635 --> 00:26:03,605
Speaker 2:  Okay. One other steam deck question. The, the one other thing I forgot to

434
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:07,405
Speaker 2:  mention is I do wanna be able to plug this thing into a large

435
00:26:07,405 --> 00:26:10,925
Speaker 2:  screen and play it. I don't think that's like the most common use case for

436
00:26:10,925 --> 00:26:14,845
Speaker 2:  me, but I do want to be able to sit in front of a television and

437
00:26:14,845 --> 00:26:18,285
Speaker 2:  play it like a console as I normally would. And for me with the switch,

438
00:26:18,725 --> 00:26:22,605
Speaker 2:  I have done that way less than I expected because you have to have such specific

439
00:26:23,005 --> 00:26:25,725
Speaker 2:  hardware to pull that off and like carrying around the dock is annoying.

440
00:26:25,745 --> 00:26:28,965
Speaker 2:  And I bought the little plug thing and that helped, but then I lost that.

441
00:26:29,145 --> 00:26:32,925
Speaker 2:  And so I want, I want something that is a little easier to turn into like

442
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:36,125
Speaker 2:  a full fledged console when I want to, is the steam deck good at that?

443
00:26:36,545 --> 00:26:40,445
Speaker 9:  You're still gonna need a little dongle. Okay. To, to mirror

444
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:41,445
Speaker 9:  things. Dongle

445
00:26:41,445 --> 00:26:41,805
Speaker 8:  Or dock.

446
00:26:41,835 --> 00:26:44,485
Speaker 9:  Yeah, you're gonna need a dongle or doc. I think the official one's like

447
00:26:44,485 --> 00:26:45,725
Speaker 9:  what, a hundred dollars Sean?

448
00:26:46,075 --> 00:26:49,405
Speaker 8:  It's less, it's, I wanna say 70, 80, something like that. But You can buy

449
00:26:49,595 --> 00:26:53,325
Speaker 8:  much cheaper than that. I'd used like an off the shelf like $35

450
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:57,565
Speaker 8:  USBC hub that A-H-D-M-I that worked. I used docs from

451
00:26:57,565 --> 00:27:01,525
Speaker 8:  like J-S-O-J-S-A-U-X great company with an alphabet

452
00:27:01,525 --> 00:27:05,445
Speaker 8:  soup name surprisingly 40, 50 bucks. And those docs are, do all

453
00:27:05,445 --> 00:27:08,805
Speaker 8:  the things you'd want from a doc. It's really easy once you get one of those

454
00:27:08,805 --> 00:27:12,765
Speaker 8:  things to get it up there. The question is, is your TV like 4K and

455
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:16,205
Speaker 8:  you're expecting 4K visuals from a console that normally plays at 800 because

456
00:27:16,675 --> 00:27:19,605
Speaker 8:  it's not gonna look as good up on a big 4K tv

457
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:24,165
Speaker 2:  I will say, and Liam or producer can vouch for this. The least VERGE

458
00:27:24,215 --> 00:27:27,445
Speaker 2:  casty thing about me is I don't care all that much about pixel density. So

459
00:27:27,465 --> 00:27:31,045
Speaker 2:  the idea of playing like at, you know, medium settings and having it work

460
00:27:31,045 --> 00:27:32,405
Speaker 2:  okay is completely fine by me.

461
00:27:32,645 --> 00:27:35,245
Speaker 9:  I just heard Neli screaming, this

462
00:27:35,245 --> 00:27:38,805
Speaker 2:  Is the last time you'll ever hear from me on The Vergecast. But that is,

463
00:27:38,805 --> 00:27:41,725
Speaker 2:  that is where I'm at and especially with something like this, like battery

464
00:27:41,755 --> 00:27:45,525
Speaker 2:  life is much more important to me than like getting 10

465
00:27:45,575 --> 00:27:49,245
Speaker 2:  extra frames per second. And so I think again, the customizability of the

466
00:27:49,245 --> 00:27:52,805
Speaker 2:  steam deck to be able to like dial that up and down as I want it seems

467
00:27:53,345 --> 00:27:53,765
Speaker 2:  useful.

468
00:27:54,225 --> 00:27:58,205
Speaker 9:  You wanna steam deck ola, like get the steam deck ole every

469
00:27:58,205 --> 00:28:01,525
Speaker 9:  once in a while you'll plug it into the tv, you'll be like, oh, I did it.

470
00:28:01,915 --> 00:28:05,325
Speaker 9:  This looks kind of shitty. And then you'll unplug it and go back to the really

471
00:28:05,325 --> 00:28:07,125
Speaker 9:  pretty ole display and be very happy.

472
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:11,485
Speaker 2:  I do suspect my switch experience has been that I set it up in

473
00:28:11,485 --> 00:28:14,005
Speaker 2:  such a way that it was gonna be really easy to dock. It was gonna be great.

474
00:28:14,105 --> 00:28:17,165
Speaker 2:  And then most of the time I would sit on my couch in front of the TV and

475
00:28:17,165 --> 00:28:20,565
Speaker 2:  just play on my lap. And I, I would assume the steamed deck will end up being

476
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:21,685
Speaker 2:  kind of the same way. Yep.

477
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:24,925
Speaker 8:  It's so good. My, we will watch, watch some shows together with my wife and

478
00:28:24,925 --> 00:28:28,605
Speaker 8:  I'll, I'll have my hand held out and get to do some, some gaming at the same

479
00:28:28,605 --> 00:28:29,085
Speaker 8:  time. It's great.

480
00:28:29,275 --> 00:28:32,565
Speaker 2:  Okay. Are there any other like crazy wild card

481
00:28:32,595 --> 00:28:36,485
Speaker 2:  possibilities coming that we know of that might win? Like

482
00:28:36,485 --> 00:28:40,125
Speaker 2:  you, you mentioned the, the RIX seems like a possible

483
00:28:40,795 --> 00:28:44,405
Speaker 2:  improvement if not sort of equal to the Steam, Deck wasn there

484
00:28:44,685 --> 00:28:47,685
Speaker 2:  anything else on the horizon that in three months I'm gonna be like, oh,

485
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:49,205
Speaker 2:  this is the one I needed. I don't

486
00:28:49,215 --> 00:28:53,085
Speaker 8:  Think so, but there are two very different directions

487
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:56,365
Speaker 8:  you could go and I don't have one of them here in front of me, but one of

488
00:28:56,365 --> 00:29:00,165
Speaker 8:  them is a 10.1 inch laptop with like

489
00:29:00,675 --> 00:29:04,565
Speaker 8:  keys that actually feel good full-size SD card reader You can

490
00:29:04,685 --> 00:29:08,165
Speaker 8:  actually shove the SD card all the way inside. We've got full-size

491
00:29:08,405 --> 00:29:09,685
Speaker 8:  USBA ports,

492
00:29:09,945 --> 00:29:11,565
Speaker 9:  It has more ports than a MacBook

493
00:29:11,965 --> 00:29:15,605
Speaker 8:  USBC ports. There's an OCU link port HDMI,

494
00:29:15,905 --> 00:29:19,605
Speaker 8:  it is your doc built into it. And then you take these little things off and

495
00:29:19,605 --> 00:29:23,405
Speaker 8:  you got joysticks a deep head. And even even this,

496
00:29:23,605 --> 00:29:26,965
Speaker 8:  this menu button in the center acts like an Xbox button, which for some reason

497
00:29:27,315 --> 00:29:30,845
Speaker 8:  none of the other Windows handhelds have. And this thing is

498
00:29:31,345 --> 00:29:35,045
Speaker 8:  way expensive. I mean it's twice the price of your steam deck. It costs more

499
00:29:35,045 --> 00:29:38,965
Speaker 8:  than any of the handhelds, but it doubles as a laptop that has the power

500
00:29:39,545 --> 00:29:42,965
Speaker 8:  of one of those other gaming handhelds in a decent sized battery, all this

501
00:29:42,965 --> 00:29:43,205
Speaker 8:  stuff.

502
00:29:43,505 --> 00:29:45,965
Speaker 9:  But Sean, how's it, how is it to play?

503
00:29:46,705 --> 00:29:50,325
Speaker 8:  It is a laptop first and a game

504
00:29:50,365 --> 00:29:51,325
Speaker 8:  handheld second.

505
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:55,285
Speaker 2:  Such a perfect gadget because that is both the stupidest thing I've ever

506
00:29:55,285 --> 00:29:57,285
Speaker 2:  seen and I want it so bad. Yeah,

507
00:29:57,285 --> 00:29:57,565
Speaker 9:  Right.

508
00:29:59,195 --> 00:30:00,005
Speaker 9:  It's beautiful.

509
00:30:00,475 --> 00:30:04,205
Speaker 2:  It's like what if instead of the touch bar, we just put a PlayStation controller

510
00:30:04,225 --> 00:30:05,885
Speaker 2:  in pieces like I love it.

511
00:30:06,965 --> 00:30:10,205
Speaker 8:  I I can't get, I can't get over at the boss mode. Like, like you got this

512
00:30:10,205 --> 00:30:14,085
Speaker 8:  thing and you're like, no, I can't show my game pad at work. Let's take this

513
00:30:14,085 --> 00:30:17,085
Speaker 8:  little metal, let's take this little slip of metal out of the back of the

514
00:30:17,265 --> 00:30:21,125
Speaker 8:  fig and and drop it on top boss mode. It's a physical

515
00:30:21,155 --> 00:30:25,085
Speaker 8:  boss mode. Yeah. Okay, moving on from that. Okay, so your, your

516
00:30:25,085 --> 00:30:29,005
Speaker 8:  other possibility is you could embrace, you could embrace software

517
00:30:29,225 --> 00:30:33,125
Speaker 8:  piracy and you could buy one of these things, which is, looks

518
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:36,205
Speaker 8:  like a game boy advances p it is the enver next fig,

519
00:30:37,265 --> 00:30:41,205
Speaker 8:  but actually just comes with thousands of pirated games. And, and so

520
00:30:41,205 --> 00:30:44,925
Speaker 8:  you could play all your gay boy VAs and PlayStation games on this and you

521
00:30:44,925 --> 00:30:48,445
Speaker 8:  delete the pirated games first and dump your own ROMs or something like that,

522
00:30:48,785 --> 00:30:49,565
Speaker 2:  As I always do.

523
00:30:49,705 --> 00:30:50,565
Speaker 8:  As you do. Yes.

524
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:54,645
Speaker 9:  I feel like Berg's already gonna get wrecked for you just saying. Yeah, it

525
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:56,725
Speaker 9:  comes with all of the pirated games on it. Every

526
00:30:56,725 --> 00:30:59,645
Speaker 2:  Time Sean talks about one of these, there was, I think you did a, you did

527
00:30:59,685 --> 00:31:03,205
Speaker 2:  a TikTok Sean talking about the, the new Amber Brunick thing and every single

528
00:31:03,205 --> 00:31:06,965
Speaker 2:  comment was like, Sean, be cool man. Stop telling people about Amber.

529
00:31:07,405 --> 00:31:07,805
Speaker 2:  Gimme my

530
00:31:07,805 --> 00:31:08,525
Speaker 8:  Freak was

531
00:31:08,905 --> 00:31:12,405
Speaker 9:  TikTok shop is all over this thing. Like it's been

532
00:31:12,405 --> 00:31:13,365
Speaker 9:  snitched on enough.

533
00:31:13,675 --> 00:31:17,405
Speaker 8:  Just to illustrate though that the ea the ea FIFA game

534
00:31:18,065 --> 00:31:21,685
Speaker 8:  is not a steam deck problem. The top comment on EA sports

535
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,765
Speaker 8:  FC 24 is ea FFC 24 not launching on

536
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:29,885
Speaker 8:  PC after anti cheat back to EA f Oh. So it's not a steam deck thing

537
00:31:29,945 --> 00:31:32,165
Speaker 8:  so much as it is an EA doesn't care thing.

538
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:36,565
Speaker 2:  Interesting. Okay. So it it truly is ea is like, there are ways

539
00:31:36,585 --> 00:31:39,925
Speaker 2:  you could get around the rules that we have. So we're just taking our ball

540
00:31:39,925 --> 00:31:43,005
Speaker 2:  and going home. Yep. That doesn't feel like it's getting better anytime soon.

541
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:47,005
Speaker 2:  That, that does not give me hope for the, for improvements coming here, which

542
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:50,405
Speaker 2:  also means, listen, there's, there's a lot of sports games. This means I

543
00:31:50,485 --> 00:31:53,805
Speaker 2:  can't play anymore, but now I'm gonna have to get into like cool nerd games.

544
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:54,485
Speaker 2:  It's gonna be great.

545
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:57,205
Speaker 9:  You You can play 'em streaming. That's

546
00:31:57,205 --> 00:32:00,485
Speaker 2:  True. Steam deck plus game pass I think is starting to feel like the realest

547
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:01,805
Speaker 2:  answer I have here.

548
00:32:02,225 --> 00:32:05,965
Speaker 9:  You'll have Halo and fifa, like you'll be the, the

549
00:32:06,025 --> 00:32:08,525
Speaker 9:  hit of every frat party you go to. Okay,

550
00:32:09,315 --> 00:32:13,205
Speaker 2:  Last question and then, and then we have to go, am

551
00:32:13,205 --> 00:32:16,125
Speaker 2:  I stupid for buying a steam deck right now in the same way that I might be

552
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:19,565
Speaker 2:  stupid for buying a switch right now? Where are we in the steam deck cycle?

553
00:32:20,015 --> 00:32:20,805
Speaker 9:  We're fine, right?

554
00:32:21,135 --> 00:32:24,685
Speaker 8:  We're mid, yeah, we're, we're mid cycle. We're not late

555
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:27,925
Speaker 8:  yet. The thing that, the thing that valve needs, they've, they've told us,

556
00:32:27,995 --> 00:32:31,845
Speaker 8:  like told me to my face, what they need to see is they

557
00:32:31,845 --> 00:32:35,645
Speaker 8:  need to see a major improvement in performance without

558
00:32:35,965 --> 00:32:39,925
Speaker 8:  sacrificing battery life from a chip manufacturer before

559
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:43,805
Speaker 8:  they start building the next true steam deck. And I've heard this from

560
00:32:43,805 --> 00:32:47,045
Speaker 8:  other companies too. Like as with the, with the R-O-G-L-I-X, they were like,

561
00:32:47,225 --> 00:32:50,445
Speaker 8:  we don't think we can get it right now, so we're gonna ship the wrong LIX

562
00:32:50,595 --> 00:32:51,525
Speaker 8:  with the same chip.

563
00:32:51,785 --> 00:32:55,605
Speaker 9:  And I don't think Qualcomm has changed that calculus at all. Yeah.

564
00:32:55,605 --> 00:32:56,525
Speaker 9:  With the Snapdragon

565
00:32:56,665 --> 00:33:00,645
Speaker 2:  And even if it has, we're a ways away from that actually appearing inside

566
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,125
Speaker 2:  of a product.

567
00:33:01,435 --> 00:33:04,405
Speaker 9:  Yeah, I think, I think we're probably a good, we're at least a year out.

568
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:08,445
Speaker 9:  I think you'll have one beautiful blissful year before you get FOMO at

569
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:08,725
Speaker 9:  least.

570
00:33:09,235 --> 00:33:11,885
Speaker 2:  Okay. And that's, I mean honestly in gadget world, that's is, that's all

571
00:33:11,885 --> 00:33:12,485
Speaker 2:  You can ask for.

572
00:33:13,035 --> 00:33:16,405
Speaker 9:  It's like a year is an, is is an eternity in gadget world.

573
00:33:16,605 --> 00:33:19,845
Speaker 2:  I mean, listen, I've made it this far into the PS five cycle without upgrading.

574
00:33:19,845 --> 00:33:23,405
Speaker 2:  Like it turns out I can, I can manage my FOMO on on this one. I

575
00:33:23,405 --> 00:33:24,525
Speaker 9:  Am so impressed.

576
00:33:24,855 --> 00:33:27,685
Speaker 2:  Thank you. That's actually the other question I should ask is like, am I

577
00:33:27,685 --> 00:33:30,645
Speaker 2:  being ridiculous? Should I just buy a PS five and move on with my life? Oh,

578
00:33:31,405 --> 00:33:35,005
Speaker 9:  I mean, have infinite, if you have infinite money, yes.

579
00:33:35,465 --> 00:33:39,005
Speaker 2:  If I buy a PS five, I almost certainly will end up buying a portal

580
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:42,045
Speaker 2:  and I, I hate myself for it, but it will probably happen

581
00:33:42,675 --> 00:33:45,485
Speaker 9:  Then I say don't, because I wanna save you from the portal.

582
00:33:45,865 --> 00:33:49,485
Speaker 8:  You could buy a used steam deck LCD for the price of a portal and also have

583
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,445
Speaker 8:  a portal built into it with an app. Oh,

584
00:33:51,445 --> 00:33:52,365
Speaker 2:  Well that's very compelling.

585
00:33:52,545 --> 00:33:56,325
Speaker 8:  But PS five, like if you do love that I'm sitting

586
00:33:56,385 --> 00:33:59,445
Speaker 8:  on my couch with my 4K ole TV experience,

587
00:34:00,235 --> 00:34:03,845
Speaker 8:  it's hard to beat the PS five for that. I'm playing Spider-Man two on it

588
00:34:03,845 --> 00:34:07,685
Speaker 8:  right now on a just a gorgeous new ole panel that was deep discounted

589
00:34:07,885 --> 00:34:11,725
Speaker 8:  recently and wow the pop of that city, the lights

590
00:34:11,865 --> 00:34:14,005
Speaker 8:  at night. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's really something.

591
00:34:14,115 --> 00:34:18,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And I, and I do love that, but I think I, I am increasingly coming

592
00:34:18,005 --> 00:34:21,685
Speaker 2:  around to like, having a thing with me is

593
00:34:21,955 --> 00:34:25,845
Speaker 2:  more important than the sort of very best possible experience.

594
00:34:26,245 --> 00:34:29,325
Speaker 2:  I I would love to have both, but I don't think You can really have both right

595
00:34:29,325 --> 00:34:30,565
Speaker 2:  now in the world we live in

596
00:34:30,865 --> 00:34:34,205
Speaker 8:  And. if you, if you really want to have that thing with you, I don't think

597
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:37,445
Speaker 8:  there's anything that beats the steam deck. There's just so much You can

598
00:34:37,465 --> 00:34:41,285
Speaker 8:  now take with you that you can't the same way through the window as handhelds.

599
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:43,485
Speaker 8:  You can't really with Android. Alright,

600
00:34:43,485 --> 00:34:47,285
Speaker 2:  Well we have ended where we began, which I find very frustrating, but also

601
00:34:47,755 --> 00:34:50,765
Speaker 2:  sort of telling I'm gonna buy a steam deck. Yeah. I probably should have

602
00:34:50,765 --> 00:34:53,765
Speaker 2:  bought a steam deck a really long time ago. I'm gonna buy a steam deck and

603
00:34:53,805 --> 00:34:57,285
Speaker 2:  I I will start yelling loudly at ea I'll report back.

604
00:34:57,665 --> 00:35:00,605
Speaker 9:  I'm so excited for you. Everybody's excited about the EA though.

605
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:03,965
Speaker 2:  Do you have any immediate setup tips before we talk again? I will have purchased

606
00:35:04,005 --> 00:35:07,405
Speaker 2:  a steam deck. What, what should I do Immediately outta the box with my brand

607
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:08,205
Speaker 2:  new steam deco lead?

608
00:35:08,405 --> 00:35:10,925
Speaker 8:  I have so many nerdy suggestions. I

609
00:35:10,925 --> 00:35:13,765
Speaker 2:  Don't want nerdy suggestions. Sean. I say this with love. I want to, I want

610
00:35:13,765 --> 00:35:13,925
Speaker 2:  to get

611
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:14,725
Speaker 8:  To, I know I was like

612
00:35:15,075 --> 00:35:18,965
Speaker 2:  Playing games well as quickly and seamlessly as possible.

613
00:35:18,965 --> 00:35:22,205
Speaker 2:  Like I am worried about the steam deck because I'm worried it's so fidgety

614
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:25,245
Speaker 2:  and finicky that I'm gonna spend my whole life goofing with the joysticks

615
00:35:25,345 --> 00:35:26,925
Speaker 2:  and not playing games.

616
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:31,525
Speaker 9:  So, so Steam Deck has this, like on the steam deck they have compatibility

617
00:35:31,585 --> 00:35:35,045
Speaker 9:  for games and You can also see it on the Steam software. So like You can

618
00:35:35,045 --> 00:35:38,205
Speaker 9:  just go download steam ahead of time, find some games you like, make sure

619
00:35:38,205 --> 00:35:41,805
Speaker 9:  they're compatible and then it'll be just outta the box ready to go. Anything

620
00:35:41,805 --> 00:35:45,565
Speaker 9:  that's like yellow or red, you'll have to mess with a little bit. That's

621
00:35:45,565 --> 00:35:48,485
Speaker 9:  where you have to start tweaking things. Like I try to play Crusader Kings

622
00:35:48,485 --> 00:35:51,645
Speaker 9:  on it. Don't, that's it's not for the Steam deck. It's terrible.

623
00:35:51,915 --> 00:35:55,845
Speaker 8:  There's even a tab in the store where You can just like, only show me games

624
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:59,645
Speaker 8:  that work well with the Steam deck. And for the most part they do.

625
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:03,245
Speaker 9:  They Yeah, and it's, it's a lot of stuff, right? Like, it, it's, it's a ton

626
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:06,325
Speaker 9:  of stuff. The ones that don't is stuff that's like mass effect, which is

627
00:36:06,785 --> 00:36:08,805
Speaker 9:  an EA game. So you know why it doesn't work.

628
00:36:08,805 --> 00:36:12,445
Speaker 2:  Well, I will say the other game in my life that I have loved with my whole

629
00:36:12,445 --> 00:36:16,365
Speaker 2:  heart, the way that I have loved FIFA with my whole heart is portal. And

630
00:36:16,365 --> 00:36:19,165
Speaker 2:  the idea of having a steam thing that will let me play the portal games forever

631
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:20,365
Speaker 2:  is very exciting.

632
00:36:20,705 --> 00:36:23,885
Speaker 9:  And it will just straight out of the box, you'll be, you'll be off to the

633
00:36:23,895 --> 00:36:27,765
Speaker 9:  races having a great time. Yeah. It, it really is so easy to just get

634
00:36:27,765 --> 00:36:31,325
Speaker 9:  going on the steam deck, provided you already own games.

635
00:36:32,255 --> 00:36:36,165
Speaker 8:  Elden Ring plays well there, Ori and the Will of the

636
00:36:36,175 --> 00:36:39,325
Speaker 8:  Wisps, if you haven't played that yet, play that on Deco lid. Okay. Oh my

637
00:36:39,325 --> 00:36:42,605
Speaker 8:  God, it looks brilliant. On the deco lid. That game is made for HDR

638
00:36:43,475 --> 00:36:45,565
Speaker 8:  Persona five. Have you played any persona games?

639
00:36:45,835 --> 00:36:48,325
Speaker 2:  Bits and pieces, but never, never super deeply. Okay.

640
00:36:48,585 --> 00:36:52,205
Speaker 8:  Get Persona five or Persona five, Royal, whichever one is better for your

641
00:36:52,205 --> 00:36:55,925
Speaker 8:  budget. Play that on Steam Deck. It's, it's, it's epic.

642
00:36:56,185 --> 00:36:58,765
Speaker 8:  We could, we could spend the rest, you spend, spend another hour talking

643
00:36:58,765 --> 00:36:59,645
Speaker 8:  about games to play on.

644
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:02,925
Speaker 9:  Yeah, I was about to say have, have you played Final Fantasy remake yet?

645
00:37:02,995 --> 00:37:04,485
Speaker 9:  Like beautiful on the Steam

646
00:37:04,485 --> 00:37:07,325
Speaker 2:  Deck. Okay. All right. My list is long and none of them are the only game

647
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:10,845
Speaker 2:  that I need it, but you know, we're doing the best we can here. You

648
00:37:10,845 --> 00:37:14,645
Speaker 9:  Can get FIFA 23 fairly easily on, on the Steam deck.

649
00:37:14,795 --> 00:37:18,685
Speaker 2:  Okay. That might help. Maybe that's like my gateway drug out of being obsessed

650
00:37:18,685 --> 00:37:22,565
Speaker 2:  with fifa. I'll just play old games enough to satiate me

651
00:37:22,565 --> 00:37:24,005
Speaker 2:  and then go play Better Games. You

652
00:37:24,005 --> 00:37:25,845
Speaker 9:  Get Ted Lasso in that one, you'll be fine.

653
00:37:28,265 --> 00:37:30,165
Speaker 2:  All right, thank you both. This was very helpful.

654
00:41:52,005 --> 00:41:55,245
Speaker 2:  anything yet. If you have ideas, please let me know. Vergecast at The Verge

655
00:41:55,265 --> 00:41:58,845
Speaker 2:  dot com. Call the hotline. Eight six six VERGE one one. What do you think

656
00:41:58,885 --> 00:42:02,485
Speaker 2:  I should buy? Tell me everything. I'm still so torn. I think Sean and Alex

657
00:42:02,555 --> 00:42:05,405
Speaker 2:  gave really good advice, but I don't know if I've actually solved my problem

658
00:42:05,505 --> 00:42:08,685
Speaker 2:  yet. Anyway, let's get into the next thing. Every once in a while in the

659
00:42:08,685 --> 00:42:12,325
Speaker 2:  show we like to test some microphones. I think this stuff really

660
00:42:12,355 --> 00:42:15,525
Speaker 2:  matters and it doesn't get talked about a lot. When we talk about headphones

661
00:42:15,785 --> 00:42:19,485
Speaker 2:  and when we talk about wearable devices, we talk to our gadgets

662
00:42:19,805 --> 00:42:23,445
Speaker 2:  a lot. And, if you believe that AI is the future of how we talk to

663
00:42:23,445 --> 00:42:27,405
Speaker 2:  gadgets, it's gonna get more vocal over time. Microphones really

664
00:42:27,465 --> 00:42:31,405
Speaker 2:  matter whether you're just talking to Siri to set reminders, which is a thing

665
00:42:31,445 --> 00:42:35,325
Speaker 2:  I do constantly all day every day. Or it's gonna be how you talk

666
00:42:35,325 --> 00:42:39,045
Speaker 2:  to chat GPT or your robot AI best

667
00:42:39,045 --> 00:42:43,005
Speaker 2:  friend for forever. Microphones really matter and we've tested

668
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:46,565
Speaker 2:  a lot of earbuds. We actually probably overdo for an earbuds test.

669
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:51,125
Speaker 2:  But the thing that we haven't really done is maybe one of the

670
00:42:51,125 --> 00:42:55,005
Speaker 2:  wearable categories I'm most excited about, which I'll say broadly

671
00:42:55,325 --> 00:42:59,125
Speaker 2:  speaking, is face gadgets. You have things like the Meta

672
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,925
Speaker 2:  Quest three and the Vision Pro. You also have things like the Meta Smart

673
00:43:01,925 --> 00:43:05,605
Speaker 2:  glasses and Amazon's echo frames and the idea of

674
00:43:05,675 --> 00:43:09,285
Speaker 2:  just a thing you wear on front of your eyes on your face.

675
00:43:09,635 --> 00:43:13,165
Speaker 2:  That is a super powerful computer. I think we're at the very beginning

676
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:17,285
Speaker 2:  of that genre of gadget, but I already think there's a lot of

677
00:43:17,485 --> 00:43:21,205
Speaker 2:  interesting stuff out there. So as we do, it's time to do a microphone test.

678
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:25,245
Speaker 2:  I asked V Song who has almost all of these gadgets, somewhat

679
00:43:25,445 --> 00:43:29,325
Speaker 2:  remarkably just lying around her house to come on and do some tests with

680
00:43:29,325 --> 00:43:33,245
Speaker 2:  us. So we're gonna hear how it all sounds. Let's go V Song. Welcome

681
00:43:33,245 --> 00:43:33,525
Speaker 2:  back.

682
00:43:33,825 --> 00:43:35,525
Speaker 11:  Thanks for having me again.

683
00:43:36,105 --> 00:43:38,645
Speaker 2:  You and I have done so much stuff together recently. This is very exciting.

684
00:43:38,715 --> 00:43:42,685
Speaker 2:  This is terrible for you and great for me. I'm, I'm happy about it. So I

685
00:43:42,685 --> 00:43:46,245
Speaker 2:  have brought you here for the thing I have been like very excited to do for

686
00:43:46,245 --> 00:43:50,085
Speaker 2:  months because what I have discovered in my own life is that now

687
00:43:50,235 --> 00:43:54,125
Speaker 2:  when I take a phone call and I'm at home, instead of holding

688
00:43:54,145 --> 00:43:57,845
Speaker 2:  my phone to my ear, I actually put on the Meta Smart glasses and that is

689
00:43:57,845 --> 00:44:01,325
Speaker 2:  now my like hands free phone experience and I love it very much.

690
00:44:01,625 --> 00:44:05,285
Speaker 2:  And I have found myself wondering a lot how I sound to other people when

691
00:44:05,285 --> 00:44:09,085
Speaker 2:  I do that. So you and I are going to do, I think, maybe the most ambitious

692
00:44:09,085 --> 00:44:12,765
Speaker 2:  microphone test we've ever done on this show because it involves a deeply

693
00:44:12,935 --> 00:44:15,325
Speaker 2:  weird set of gadgets and I'm very excited about it.

694
00:44:15,805 --> 00:44:19,365
Speaker 11:  I spent so much time yesterday and this morning prepping

695
00:44:19,665 --> 00:44:23,405
Speaker 11:  the, just for the technical logistics

696
00:44:23,465 --> 00:44:27,405
Speaker 11:  of all of it. And I looked ridiculous at every step of the

697
00:44:27,405 --> 00:44:27,885
Speaker 11:  way. So

698
00:44:28,505 --> 00:44:31,480
Speaker 2:  As it should be. So yeah. Okay, run me through the list of all the stuff

699
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,165
Speaker 2:  we're about to test, which is basically like every weird face

700
00:44:35,225 --> 00:44:36,685
Speaker 2:  gadget in v's house.

701
00:44:37,145 --> 00:44:40,965
Speaker 11:  You know, it's a very thoughtful selection of the weird face gadgets in

702
00:44:40,965 --> 00:44:44,925
Speaker 11:  my house. Okay, so we have the Razer Zu, which are a

703
00:44:44,925 --> 00:44:48,765
Speaker 11:  productivity pair of smart glasses. You know, they marketed as

704
00:44:49,085 --> 00:44:52,605
Speaker 11:  basically like smart glasses for hands-free calls.

705
00:44:52,865 --> 00:44:55,925
Speaker 11:  And when you're on your computer that has blue light, what, what do you

706
00:44:55,925 --> 00:44:59,445
Speaker 11:  call these lenses? So we have those, then we have the

707
00:44:59,705 --> 00:45:03,565
Speaker 11:  RayBan Metas Smartt glasses, we have the Apple Vision Pro

708
00:45:03,985 --> 00:45:06,605
Speaker 11:  and we have the Meta Quest three. Amazing.

709
00:45:06,965 --> 00:45:10,685
Speaker 2:  I will say the only one in this category I feel like we don't have in here

710
00:45:10,905 --> 00:45:14,845
Speaker 2:  is probably the echo frames. I think anecdotally no one

711
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:18,325
Speaker 2:  seems to care about the echo frames, so I don't feel that bad leaving it

712
00:45:18,325 --> 00:45:20,845
Speaker 2:  out. But I do think it's like, it's like the one in this category that I'm

713
00:45:20,845 --> 00:45:23,285
Speaker 2:  curious about that we're not testing. So we'll have to come back and do that

714
00:45:23,285 --> 00:45:23,765
Speaker 2:  another time.

715
00:45:23,995 --> 00:45:27,765
Speaker 11:  Yeah, well I do have a pair. I just moved not that

716
00:45:27,765 --> 00:45:31,525
Speaker 11:  long ago and then did spring cleaning. So the charger, where is the charger?

717
00:45:31,725 --> 00:45:35,125
Speaker 11:  I have been tearing my house apart for the charger because it's a, it's

718
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:37,005
Speaker 11:  a weird charger. Okay,

719
00:45:37,005 --> 00:45:40,845
Speaker 2:  This is a good point. It's not just A-U-S-B-C port, which

720
00:45:40,845 --> 00:45:44,725
Speaker 2:  is what all chargers should be. It's a stupid like stand that you have

721
00:45:45,085 --> 00:45:48,965
Speaker 2:  to stick them on top of And. if you don't push them down at the

722
00:45:48,965 --> 00:45:52,245
Speaker 2:  right angle in the right way, it doesn't work. It's one of the worst chargers

723
00:45:52,245 --> 00:45:53,245
Speaker 2:  I've ever used. I hate

724
00:45:53,245 --> 00:45:57,165
Speaker 11:  It. It's also the glasses that stay on my face the least because I have

725
00:45:57,165 --> 00:45:59,285
Speaker 11:  a low nose bridge and it just slips down.

726
00:45:59,425 --> 00:46:02,845
Speaker 2:  That's my problem with the metas smartt glasses. So I'm sort of hoping

727
00:46:03,605 --> 00:46:07,485
Speaker 2:  that the meta ones don't win so that I can convince myself to

728
00:46:07,485 --> 00:46:10,605
Speaker 2:  buy something else. But we're gonna see how this goes. So before we dive

729
00:46:10,605 --> 00:46:14,485
Speaker 2:  in, I think the one caveat we should provide here is that so

730
00:46:14,485 --> 00:46:17,405
Speaker 2:  far you're talking into your podcast, Mike. So I would say this is, this

731
00:46:17,405 --> 00:46:20,205
Speaker 2:  is kind of the gold standard of the audio that you should hear. Anything

732
00:46:20,315 --> 00:46:24,045
Speaker 2:  that we test is going to be compared to this. There are a couple that we're

733
00:46:24,045 --> 00:46:27,845
Speaker 2:  about to test that are Bluetooth devices. So you're gonna be pairing Bluetooth

734
00:46:27,845 --> 00:46:31,205
Speaker 2:  devices to your computer. So you're gonna get whatever Bluetooth weirdness

735
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:34,765
Speaker 2:  exists. But I would say that's fine. 'cause that's pretty indicative of normal

736
00:46:34,765 --> 00:46:37,765
Speaker 2:  Bluetooth weirdness. Like most of peop, most of the time people are talking

737
00:46:37,915 --> 00:46:41,405
Speaker 2:  through Bluetooth gadgets. So we're gonna do that. But then there's a couple,

738
00:46:41,605 --> 00:46:45,205
Speaker 2:  I think the headsets are going to be basically treated like

739
00:46:45,205 --> 00:46:48,565
Speaker 2:  microphones on computers because we're actually gonna be able to do it natively

740
00:46:48,625 --> 00:46:52,365
Speaker 2:  inside of the device. So we'll talk about those when we get to those. But

741
00:46:52,365 --> 00:46:53,725
Speaker 2:  let's just dive in. Which one do you wanna do first?

742
00:46:54,435 --> 00:46:58,245
Speaker 11:  I've got the Anzo on right now, so let's just do that because I

743
00:46:58,295 --> 00:47:01,365
Speaker 11:  swear to God this is gonna be a logistical nightmare when we're switching.

744
00:47:01,965 --> 00:47:05,565
Speaker 2:  I cannot wait. This is, this is one of those times where podcast editing

745
00:47:05,565 --> 00:47:08,925
Speaker 2:  becomes very, very, very helpful because you don't have to listen to us fiddle

746
00:47:08,925 --> 00:47:12,125
Speaker 2:  with Bluetooth settings, but all right, let's, let's dive in. Let's go.

747
00:47:13,265 --> 00:47:17,045
Speaker 12:  All right. I am talking, I am saying a sentence. Oh no, and your face

748
00:47:17,185 --> 00:47:20,485
Speaker 12:  is like saying that it does not sound good. This

749
00:47:20,485 --> 00:47:24,205
Speaker 2:  Is terrible. This is like, okay, how would I describe it?

750
00:47:24,345 --> 00:47:28,205
Speaker 2:  You sound like you're on a phone call on speaker phone,

751
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:32,405
Speaker 2:  but you've done the thing where you put your phone down on the kitchen counter

752
00:47:32,655 --> 00:47:35,245
Speaker 2:  while we're talking and then you've like walked into the other room.

753
00:47:35,835 --> 00:47:39,805
Speaker 12:  Cool. Love it. I can imagine what that sounds like. And you

754
00:47:39,805 --> 00:47:43,525
Speaker 12:  know, I don't, I, I not really sure where the mics are on

755
00:47:43,555 --> 00:47:47,005
Speaker 12:  this particular thing, but I don't think they're like the Met Ray bands

756
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:50,805
Speaker 12:  where the mic is in the nose bridge. So it's like kind of close

757
00:47:50,985 --> 00:47:54,645
Speaker 12:  to your mouth. It says that they have omnidirectional mics

758
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:58,845
Speaker 12:  probably in the temples. So if they're in the temples, that's, you know,

759
00:47:58,845 --> 00:48:01,325
Speaker 12:  pretty far away from the actual sound source.

760
00:48:01,665 --> 00:48:04,725
Speaker 2:  And actually in a certain way sort of defeats the purpose of why I'm excited

761
00:48:04,725 --> 00:48:07,285
Speaker 2:  about these devices. 'cause as you're talking about, one of the nice things

762
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:10,285
Speaker 2:  about glasses is just that they're closer to your mouth, right? We have,

763
00:48:10,285 --> 00:48:14,045
Speaker 2:  yeah, all these Bluetooth headphones and stuff, they, they are constrained

764
00:48:14,045 --> 00:48:16,885
Speaker 2:  by the fact that they're on your ears. So they have the stems that point

765
00:48:16,885 --> 00:48:18,965
Speaker 2:  towards your mouth and that kind of helps. And they're getting smarter with

766
00:48:18,965 --> 00:48:21,765
Speaker 2:  the software. But fundamentally, like the way to get a good microphone is

767
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:25,365
Speaker 2:  to put it closer to your mouth, where the sound is coming from and

768
00:48:25,905 --> 00:48:29,845
Speaker 2:  it feels like Razer just sort of beefed this one. So

769
00:48:30,345 --> 00:48:34,285
Speaker 2:  to razor's credit, I guess defense slightly, these

770
00:48:34,285 --> 00:48:37,525
Speaker 2:  aren't necessarily meant for this kind of like

771
00:48:38,005 --> 00:48:40,045
Speaker 2:  communication sorts of calls, right? These are things you're supposed to

772
00:48:40,045 --> 00:48:43,285
Speaker 2:  wear like at your desk to make it a little less painful to look at a screen

773
00:48:43,305 --> 00:48:43,645
Speaker 2:  all day.

774
00:48:44,745 --> 00:48:48,125
Speaker 12:  So they, you know, there's like a while where Razer was just like, we're

775
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:51,805
Speaker 12:  not just gaming, we do productivity stuff too. Yay for the office.

776
00:48:52,345 --> 00:48:56,045
Speaker 12:  And I think this was part of that push, like yeah, they do have blue light

777
00:48:56,045 --> 00:48:59,125
Speaker 12:  lenses so that if you're looking at the screen a lot, it's easier for you.

778
00:48:59,475 --> 00:49:03,205
Speaker 12:  They are your typical pair of glasses that are also headphones.

779
00:49:03,305 --> 00:49:06,885
Speaker 12:  So You can just listen to stuff. But you know, like when I took the briefing

780
00:49:07,005 --> 00:49:10,725
Speaker 12:  a couple years ago and was testing this, it was just basically like,

781
00:49:10,755 --> 00:49:14,685
Speaker 12:  yeah, it is meant for like productivity in the office. So You

782
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:18,605
Speaker 12:  can take phone calls and you'll sound really great. So obviously that

783
00:49:18,605 --> 00:49:21,725
Speaker 12:  was some marketing spiel because clearly

784
00:49:22,395 --> 00:49:24,885
Speaker 12:  judging by your reaction, I do not sound that great.

785
00:49:25,155 --> 00:49:28,085
Speaker 2:  Yeah, you will not sound really great. I can tell you that now with, with

786
00:49:28,085 --> 00:49:32,005
Speaker 2:  great confidence. Andrew Marino. I don't usually get to

787
00:49:32,005 --> 00:49:35,565
Speaker 2:  do this when we're here, but Andrew is, is our sound expert and podcast

788
00:49:35,585 --> 00:49:39,285
Speaker 2:  editor. Andrew, I, I want you to weigh in on all of these with me. What do

789
00:49:39,285 --> 00:49:39,845
Speaker 2:  you think of this one?

790
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:44,245
Speaker 13:  Okay, so these aren't as bad as I thought. It is a

791
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:47,485
Speaker 13:  obviously a clear difference between a podcast microphone and, and this,

792
00:49:48,065 --> 00:49:51,925
Speaker 13:  but I don't hear a lot of background noise. That is true. That is

793
00:49:51,925 --> 00:49:55,205
Speaker 13:  good. I would actually like to hear how this sounds compared to like

794
00:49:55,435 --> 00:49:59,285
Speaker 13:  someone wearing AirPods though too, because would you

795
00:49:59,285 --> 00:50:02,925
Speaker 13:  prefer hearing AirPods microphones or would you prefer hearing

796
00:50:03,305 --> 00:50:04,885
Speaker 13:  the glasses microphones?

797
00:50:05,285 --> 00:50:08,485
Speaker 2:  I was just thinking about that actually. And I think the thing that the AirPods

798
00:50:08,545 --> 00:50:12,525
Speaker 2:  do that these aren't doing is at least the AirPods push the

799
00:50:12,525 --> 00:50:16,045
Speaker 2:  voice more to the center of the mix, right? Like it's trying really

800
00:50:16,245 --> 00:50:19,605
Speaker 2:  hard to like raise the volume of your voice as opposed to everything else.

801
00:50:19,955 --> 00:50:23,765
Speaker 2:  This feels flatter in a way that is like probably more

802
00:50:23,965 --> 00:50:26,845
Speaker 2:  pleasant in a certain way, but also just means I can like hear you less.

803
00:50:26,955 --> 00:50:27,245
Speaker 2:  Well

804
00:50:27,845 --> 00:50:31,485
Speaker 11:  I also wonder what it would be like if, you know, the other proposition

805
00:50:31,505 --> 00:50:34,845
Speaker 11:  for glasses is that like you're on a walk, You can go outside and take the

806
00:50:34,845 --> 00:50:37,925
Speaker 11:  phone call as well and you know, outside there's a lot more ambient noise.

807
00:50:37,925 --> 00:50:41,685
Speaker 11:  There's cars, there's wind. I wonder what this would sound like if you were

808
00:50:41,785 --> 00:50:45,525
Speaker 11:  on a walk. 'cause I've taken calls on the Met of Raybans while I'm on a

809
00:50:45,525 --> 00:50:48,645
Speaker 11:  walk and people think they're pretty decent, pretty good just 'cause of

810
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:52,445
Speaker 11:  where the microphone is situated. So I, you know, they always claim that

811
00:50:52,445 --> 00:50:55,685
Speaker 11:  they're great for wind and I'm always like, but are they, are they?

812
00:50:56,075 --> 00:50:59,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah, we should say you're, you're in your house in what I would call like

813
00:50:59,805 --> 00:51:03,645
Speaker 2:  a relatively quiet space. This is kind of as good as

814
00:51:03,925 --> 00:51:07,165
Speaker 2:  it's gonna be. We'll we'll have to come back and do this another time with

815
00:51:07,495 --> 00:51:10,965
Speaker 2:  worse environments. But I think particularly 'cause we had some of the headsets

816
00:51:10,965 --> 00:51:13,685
Speaker 2:  and these are like things you're mostly gonna be doing inside. We wanted

817
00:51:13,685 --> 00:51:16,685
Speaker 2:  to give it its best shot. Yeah. But okay, I'm done with these. These are

818
00:51:16,685 --> 00:51:20,525
Speaker 2:  not great. Let, let's, let's move on. Let's do, let's do The Ray band

819
00:51:20,525 --> 00:51:23,885
Speaker 2:  ones next. That feels like a good one-to-one comparison here. Let's switch

820
00:51:23,885 --> 00:51:24,165
Speaker 2:  to those.

821
00:51:24,505 --> 00:51:28,245
Speaker 11:  All right. Okay. This is me and the meta and I

822
00:51:28,245 --> 00:51:31,885
Speaker 11:  just want you to know that I'm blind because I have my contacts on and these

823
00:51:31,885 --> 00:51:35,205
Speaker 11:  are prescription lenses, so you are just a big blob on my phone.

824
00:51:35,595 --> 00:51:39,485
Speaker 2:  This sounds way better like night and day to the

825
00:51:39,485 --> 00:51:43,445
Speaker 2:  last one. This is actually like the sound I was hoping that this was

826
00:51:43,455 --> 00:51:46,965
Speaker 2:  going to give me. It's not like amazing. It's, it's definitely, I'm hearing

827
00:51:47,045 --> 00:51:50,885
Speaker 2:  a lot of compression on your voice. It's, it's like clearly trying very

828
00:51:50,915 --> 00:51:54,845
Speaker 2:  hard to get your voice and cancel even not a lot of background noise, but

829
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:58,765
Speaker 2:  this sounds great. I should say also you're on your phone

830
00:51:58,945 --> 00:52:01,885
Speaker 2:  to do this, normally record these things on your computer, but because of

831
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:06,165
Speaker 2:  the weirdness of these glasses, you had an easier time connecting

832
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:10,005
Speaker 2:  them to your phone than to your computer because Bluetooth is dumb and

833
00:52:10,005 --> 00:52:12,925
Speaker 2:  bad and complicated and nobody is good at it. But you sound really good to

834
00:52:12,925 --> 00:52:13,045
Speaker 2:  me.

835
00:52:13,235 --> 00:52:16,605
Speaker 11:  Yeah, so this was like one of the limitations that Becca pointed out when

836
00:52:16,605 --> 00:52:20,405
Speaker 11:  we were both doing The Ray Vanta meta testing and she

837
00:52:20,405 --> 00:52:23,765
Speaker 11:  like went all in on the, the microphone testing for these and

838
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:28,285
Speaker 11:  it's just not really all that easy to, you know, connect with

839
00:52:28,285 --> 00:52:31,845
Speaker 11:  your computer while having these on. This is just a very phone

840
00:52:31,935 --> 00:52:35,445
Speaker 11:  first kind of pairing situation, which is a little annoying,

841
00:52:35,905 --> 00:52:39,805
Speaker 11:  but great. If you wanna take these outside I think and

842
00:52:39,805 --> 00:52:43,405
Speaker 11:  just like walk around and take calls while you're, I do that all the time.

843
00:52:43,555 --> 00:52:47,485
Speaker 11:  Like I'll be on a walk and a friend will call and I'll just gab and

844
00:52:47,485 --> 00:52:51,165
Speaker 11:  people will look at me crazy 'cause I don't have the social cue of having

845
00:52:51,355 --> 00:52:55,165
Speaker 11:  AirPods in my ear and these just look like a normal pair of glasses,

846
00:52:55,905 --> 00:52:58,005
Speaker 11:  so I just look like a psycho.

847
00:52:58,195 --> 00:53:01,125
Speaker 2:  Well, and right now you have sunglasses on indoors, which I would say is

848
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:02,405
Speaker 2:  like an extremely cool move.

849
00:53:02,945 --> 00:53:06,565
Speaker 11:  Is it, is it, is it, is it cool who can say

850
00:53:06,875 --> 00:53:10,725
Speaker 11:  also like, yeah, so I got these sent with prescription lenses as

851
00:53:10,725 --> 00:53:14,685
Speaker 11:  sunglasses and I was like, I would've loved it if these were

852
00:53:14,785 --> 00:53:18,045
Speaker 11:  the transition lenses, but alas,

853
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:22,245
Speaker 2:  I have the transitions and they're awesome. My dad who does not have

854
00:53:22,245 --> 00:53:26,205
Speaker 2:  smart glasses, just has transition lenses in his regular glasses

855
00:53:26,625 --> 00:53:30,285
Speaker 2:  and we made fun of him about it for so long because it's like you go

856
00:53:30,285 --> 00:53:33,325
Speaker 2:  inside and for four minutes you just have sunglasses on and we always used

857
00:53:33,325 --> 00:53:36,965
Speaker 2:  to make fun of it and like boy has history proven him, right? Like, congrats

858
00:53:36,965 --> 00:53:40,485
Speaker 2:  dad, you made transition lenses a thing. They are great. I'm, I'm a fan.

859
00:53:40,705 --> 00:53:44,565
Speaker 2:  So the thing that I like about these, this is the one where they put the

860
00:53:44,565 --> 00:53:47,885
Speaker 2:  microphone like right next to your nose, right? So it's, it's yes sort of

861
00:53:47,885 --> 00:53:50,445
Speaker 2:  perfectly where it should be to sound good here.

862
00:53:50,835 --> 00:53:54,645
Speaker 11:  Yeah, there's, I believe there's five microphones in the glasses at various

863
00:53:54,745 --> 00:53:58,565
Speaker 11:  points, but the one that captures your voice is just right in the nose bridge,

864
00:53:59,105 --> 00:54:02,925
Speaker 11:  so it's like right above your mouth. So like I think that was

865
00:54:03,065 --> 00:54:07,005
Speaker 11:  the kind of low key genius move that they

866
00:54:07,005 --> 00:54:10,925
Speaker 11:  did with these compared to the other smart glasses that I've tested. So

867
00:54:11,005 --> 00:54:14,645
Speaker 11:  I, I gotta say I really enjoy these as my outdoor walk,

868
00:54:14,715 --> 00:54:18,565
Speaker 11:  outdoor, I wear these while running too and it's pretty great as like a

869
00:54:18,565 --> 00:54:22,445
Speaker 11:  pair of open hair, headphones, I can take calls. The

870
00:54:22,445 --> 00:54:26,285
Speaker 11:  sunglasses are great, the sound quality is great. So I just wish

871
00:54:26,325 --> 00:54:29,045
Speaker 11:  I had transition lenses 'cause then I could just use these all the time.

872
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:30,165
Speaker 11:  That'd be great. Totally.

873
00:54:30,265 --> 00:54:31,165
Speaker 2:  Andrew, what do you think?

874
00:54:31,515 --> 00:54:35,285
Speaker 13:  Yeah, these sound better than the Razer ones. I wouldn't be

875
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:38,805
Speaker 13:  mad at all about this as far as like Bluetooth goes. It's pretty, pretty

876
00:54:39,005 --> 00:54:39,205
Speaker 13:  good.

877
00:54:39,475 --> 00:54:42,845
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I, I agree. This is definitely one that is like notably better

878
00:54:43,235 --> 00:54:47,085
Speaker 2:  than AirPods and it just, you feel much closer, which

879
00:54:47,085 --> 00:54:49,565
Speaker 2:  is really nice. Like a lot of the things, and this is the challenge with

880
00:54:49,565 --> 00:54:52,925
Speaker 2:  the, the Razer one is a lot of Bluetooth headphones just make you feel sort

881
00:54:52,925 --> 00:54:56,805
Speaker 2:  of far away because you are far away. This one you, you feel

882
00:54:56,805 --> 00:55:00,285
Speaker 2:  much closer to the mic, which makes you feel much closer like to me as we're

883
00:55:00,285 --> 00:55:04,085
Speaker 2:  talking. Which is, which is very cool. This one I'm calling a victory. Let's,

884
00:55:04,085 --> 00:55:06,125
Speaker 2:  let's move on to some of the other ones. What do we have next?

885
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:10,125
Speaker 11:  We have your pick of which headset? The Vision Pro or

886
00:55:10,465 --> 00:55:11,325
Speaker 11:  the Meta? Quest.

887
00:55:11,735 --> 00:55:14,925
Speaker 2:  Let's start with the Quest because I would assume that the Vision Pro is

888
00:55:14,925 --> 00:55:18,805
Speaker 2:  gonna sound better, but also I think more people have quests. So let's,

889
00:55:18,805 --> 00:55:19,605
Speaker 2:  let's start with Quest.

890
00:55:19,955 --> 00:55:22,885
Speaker 11:  This is going to be logistically fraught, so

891
00:55:23,375 --> 00:55:26,325
Speaker 2:  We're gonna play some hold music. We'll be back in like 45 minutes once we

892
00:55:26,325 --> 00:55:27,165
Speaker 2:  get this set up. Okay,

893
00:55:27,215 --> 00:55:28,125
Speaker 11:  Let's do it. Alright.

894
00:55:29,635 --> 00:55:32,405
Speaker 2:  Meta. Quest. Is this the Quest two or the Quest three that we're on here?

895
00:55:32,525 --> 00:55:32,645
Speaker 2:  V

896
00:55:33,165 --> 00:55:35,005
Speaker 11:  Quest three I believe. Yeah, quest three.

897
00:55:35,185 --> 00:55:36,725
Speaker 2:  All right, let's hear it. How do we sound?

898
00:55:37,365 --> 00:55:41,085
Speaker 11:  I am talking, supposedly You can hear me even though

899
00:55:41,315 --> 00:55:44,965
Speaker 11:  this gave me a lot of grief about there being no microphone while logging

900
00:55:45,035 --> 00:55:46,645
Speaker 11:  into this. So it's very confusing.

901
00:55:46,995 --> 00:55:50,485
Speaker 2:  Okay, this sounds really good. I, this is kind of right in line with the

902
00:55:50,485 --> 00:55:54,325
Speaker 2:  smart glasses actually, which I'm realizing now it's two meta products

903
00:55:54,325 --> 00:55:58,045
Speaker 2:  that sit on your face. Maybe there's some shared technology there, but I

904
00:55:58,045 --> 00:56:01,285
Speaker 2:  don't know how that didn't occur to me until just now. But yeah, you sound

905
00:56:01,285 --> 00:56:04,405
Speaker 2:  pretty good. This is just another like big

906
00:56:04,815 --> 00:56:07,805
Speaker 2:  microphone on your face. And this is another one that I think they, they

907
00:56:07,805 --> 00:56:11,725
Speaker 2:  put the microphone pretty centrally on the thing, so it

908
00:56:11,845 --> 00:56:14,485
Speaker 2:  might even be closer to your mouth than the smart glasses.

909
00:56:15,065 --> 00:56:18,845
Speaker 11:  Oh well it certainly is weighing on my head so it feels like it's

910
00:56:18,845 --> 00:56:21,325
Speaker 11:  falling down my face more than the smart glasses.

911
00:56:21,715 --> 00:56:24,365
Speaker 2:  It's gonna be on top of your mouth here in a couple of minutes as you're

912
00:56:24,365 --> 00:56:25,205
Speaker 2:  trying to talk. It'll be good.

913
00:56:25,475 --> 00:56:29,125
Speaker 11:  Yeah, it's, it's actually, it's 'cause I don't have it super tight on the

914
00:56:29,345 --> 00:56:33,165
Speaker 11:  the back because I get headaches when these are too tight. Mm. Oh there

915
00:56:33,165 --> 00:56:33,965
Speaker 11:  we go. There we go.

916
00:56:34,235 --> 00:56:38,205
Speaker 2:  Okay, so what I, what I also want to know is tell me about the experience

917
00:56:38,205 --> 00:56:41,725
Speaker 2:  of getting into this call from the Quest

918
00:56:42,005 --> 00:56:45,325
Speaker 2:  because there's like the, one of the things that Meta would really like to

919
00:56:45,565 --> 00:56:48,685
Speaker 2:  convince you of is that eventually a VR headset is going to be a work tool

920
00:56:48,685 --> 00:56:51,805
Speaker 2:  and You can you just like open up a browser and use it for Google Meet or

921
00:56:51,965 --> 00:56:55,885
Speaker 2:  whatever. I have never done that one time and I'm very curious how it's going

922
00:56:55,885 --> 00:56:56,165
Speaker 2:  for you.

923
00:56:56,905 --> 00:57:00,845
Speaker 11:  So I basically had to log into

924
00:57:00,845 --> 00:57:04,765
Speaker 11:  Slack, right? Because I need a link to this meeting and so how

925
00:57:04,765 --> 00:57:08,245
Speaker 11:  am I gonna get a link to this particular meeting? So you know, like

926
00:57:08,345 --> 00:57:12,085
Speaker 11:  either you have to have your calendar in here, some in some capacity, or

927
00:57:12,085 --> 00:57:15,405
Speaker 11:  you have to basically go into the browser, go into your Google calendar

928
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:19,445
Speaker 11:  and and whatnot. But I then I was just like, oh God, okay.

929
00:57:19,545 --> 00:57:23,045
Speaker 11:  So I went into Slack, which in our

930
00:57:23,045 --> 00:57:27,005
Speaker 11:  workplace, because things are secure was real effing

931
00:57:27,205 --> 00:57:28,725
Speaker 11:  annoying because

932
00:57:29,065 --> 00:57:32,085
Speaker 2:  Two factor authentication in a headset, not a solved problem, two

933
00:57:32,085 --> 00:57:36,005
Speaker 11:  Factor authentication in a headset, lemme tell you it's not fun. And

934
00:57:36,045 --> 00:57:39,645
Speaker 11:  I was a good Foxed employee. I have a very complicated

935
00:57:40,045 --> 00:57:43,645
Speaker 11:  password for my work thing. So I'm just going in and this

936
00:57:43,885 --> 00:57:47,125
Speaker 11:  13, 14, 15 character, long pa, I don't know how long it is, it's long, but

937
00:57:47,145 --> 00:57:50,365
Speaker 11:  I'm just like punching it in with this stupid little keyboard just going,

938
00:57:50,385 --> 00:57:53,965
Speaker 11:  eh, eh, capital, oh that's not a capital, I have to reenter all of this.

939
00:57:53,965 --> 00:57:57,605
Speaker 11:  Then we have two factor authentication and I have to go, thankfully I get

940
00:57:57,605 --> 00:58:01,365
Speaker 11:  it sent to my watch. So I get it, boom into the watch. I'm like, yeah, cool,

941
00:58:01,365 --> 00:58:04,645
Speaker 11:  awesome. Then I'm in Slack and then I have to go like in the wa in the browser

942
00:58:04,645 --> 00:58:08,205
Speaker 11:  and Slack and I have to go, okay, now I gotta go to the link that I know

943
00:58:08,305 --> 00:58:12,005
Speaker 11:  is in this dm and then, oh, okay, I gotta scroll on the dm, click on the

944
00:58:12,005 --> 00:58:15,565
Speaker 11:  link that opens up Riverside and the browser. And then I'm like,

945
00:58:16,355 --> 00:58:20,125
Speaker 11:  cool, I'm gonna just log in even though it's saying that there is no

946
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:23,525
Speaker 11:  micro camera detected. So yeah,

947
00:58:23,905 --> 00:58:25,685
Speaker 11:  Andrew helped me test this before.

948
00:58:26,745 --> 00:58:30,565
Speaker 2:  It is, it is quite a project, so, okay. Andrew, I, I'm really curious

949
00:58:30,585 --> 00:58:33,085
Speaker 2:  for your thoughts on this one because I, I want to know how you feel about

950
00:58:33,085 --> 00:58:36,805
Speaker 2:  this versus the smart glasses because what I am hearing is very similar,

951
00:58:36,945 --> 00:58:40,445
Speaker 2:  but this sounds like it's compressing harder to me, but

952
00:58:40,875 --> 00:58:41,485
Speaker 2:  what are you hearing?

953
00:58:41,635 --> 00:58:45,165
Speaker 13:  There's a bit of compression here. I'm also wondering if it's

954
00:58:45,435 --> 00:58:48,725
Speaker 13:  Riverside's echo cancellation here, but it is not

955
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:52,365
Speaker 13:  significantly better than the meta ray bands.

956
00:58:52,835 --> 00:58:56,565
Speaker 13:  This is a great sound for taking a meeting

957
00:58:57,075 --> 00:59:00,525
Speaker 13:  call, but if he was like, Hey, can I join the podcast

958
00:59:00,795 --> 00:59:04,685
Speaker 13:  with the Quest three? I'd be like, well can you use your

959
00:59:04,685 --> 00:59:04,845
Speaker 13:  phone?

960
00:59:05,455 --> 00:59:08,725
Speaker 2:  Right. I think that's right. Like none of this has gotten even up to like

961
00:59:08,935 --> 00:59:12,925
Speaker 2:  wired ear pods quality, but at least so far this is

962
00:59:12,925 --> 00:59:16,605
Speaker 2:  definitely better than Razer, but I would say not quite as good as the Meadow

963
00:59:16,635 --> 00:59:20,605
Speaker 2:  ones. My theory, I wonder about the echo cancellation too, but I also wonder

964
00:59:20,665 --> 00:59:24,605
Speaker 2:  if, because meta assumes you're gonna be playing games all

965
00:59:24,605 --> 00:59:27,805
Speaker 2:  the time on this thing that it's going to have audio all the time. And so

966
00:59:27,805 --> 00:59:31,605
Speaker 2:  they've just turned up the echo cancellation on the device itself

967
00:59:32,275 --> 00:59:36,205
Speaker 2:  just so it's trying to noise cancel against what's coming out of the speakers

968
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:39,725
Speaker 2:  all the time. 'cause it's just, it is compressing this pretty

969
00:59:39,725 --> 00:59:40,365
Speaker 2:  aggressively.

970
00:59:40,665 --> 00:59:44,045
Speaker 13:  It does sound like there is some processing happening. Yeah. Before it gets

971
00:59:44,075 --> 00:59:44,525
Speaker 13:  into here.

972
00:59:45,005 --> 00:59:48,925
Speaker 2:  V how are the speakers on this? Like the actual listening experience is

973
00:59:48,925 --> 00:59:52,205
Speaker 2:  pretty solid, right? I feel like. Yeah, yeah. So this, this, I agree it would

974
00:59:52,205 --> 00:59:55,845
Speaker 2:  work in a pinch in a meeting, but Andrew would not allow you on The Vergecast

975
00:59:56,105 --> 00:59:58,365
Speaker 2:  in, in the headset under normal circumstances.

976
00:59:58,835 --> 01:00:02,565
Speaker 11:  Also, like if you're reaching for a headset in a pinch

977
01:00:02,985 --> 01:00:05,765
Speaker 11:  for a meeting, something has gone terribly wrong,

978
01:00:06,725 --> 01:00:06,845
Speaker 2:  Consider

979
01:00:06,845 --> 01:00:10,365
Speaker 11:  Your choices. Something has gone terribly wrong, terribly, terribly wrong

980
01:00:10,365 --> 01:00:14,045
Speaker 11:  because where's your phone? There's just easier things to do than to

981
01:00:14,115 --> 01:00:17,845
Speaker 11:  swap on a headset. And then, you know, like I had gotten logged

982
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:21,605
Speaker 11:  out of my account because the spouse logged into this at some point and

983
01:00:21,605 --> 01:00:25,165
Speaker 11:  it was playing games. Then it was just like, where's my account? Oh,

984
01:00:25,525 --> 01:00:28,885
Speaker 11:  I forgot. I don't remember what my Facebook password is. Oh, you're telling

985
01:00:28,885 --> 01:00:32,325
Speaker 11:  me I have to log into this with that, that this was an ordeal yesterday

986
01:00:32,325 --> 01:00:34,045
Speaker 11:  getting this prepped for today.

987
01:00:34,835 --> 01:00:37,845
Speaker 2:  Well, in the name of making everything simpler and better, let's make it

988
01:00:37,845 --> 01:00:40,325
Speaker 2:  more complicated. Let's switch and do the Vision Pro. Let's try that next.

989
01:00:40,465 --> 01:00:40,685
Speaker 2:  Oh

990
01:00:40,685 --> 01:00:43,645
Speaker 11:  Good lord. Here we, you know, actually that might be slightly easier than

991
01:00:43,645 --> 01:00:45,085
Speaker 11:  this one because Yeah,

992
01:00:45,085 --> 01:00:47,645
Speaker 2:  Okay. All right, we'll, we'll we'll go back to the hold music. We'll be right

993
01:00:47,645 --> 01:00:47,805
Speaker 2:  back.

994
01:00:48,185 --> 01:00:48,845
Speaker 11:  All right, hold on.

995
01:00:49,945 --> 01:00:53,725
Speaker 2:  All right, well it took, it took some digging in settings and some app

996
01:00:53,965 --> 01:00:57,725
Speaker 2:  rebooting, but we got it working and now your persona is here and I, I

997
01:00:57,725 --> 01:01:01,005
Speaker 2:  hate this already, but I'm, I'm gonna not look, I'm just gonna listen.

998
01:01:01,605 --> 01:01:02,565
Speaker 2:  How do we sound? How are we doing?

999
01:01:03,075 --> 01:01:06,885
Speaker 11:  This was a nightmare. This is a nightmare. Everything's a

1000
01:01:06,885 --> 01:01:10,325
Speaker 11:  nightmare air. I can't stop looking at my horrible

1001
01:01:10,715 --> 01:01:13,605
Speaker 11:  persona. Why is my hair so lumpy?

1002
01:01:14,705 --> 01:01:18,325
Speaker 11:  My eyebrows are also misaligned, so I just look

1003
01:01:18,555 --> 01:01:19,045
Speaker 11:  dubious.

1004
01:01:19,505 --> 01:01:23,485
Speaker 2:  The good news is you sound great. I'm actually like amazed

1005
01:01:23,585 --> 01:01:27,365
Speaker 2:  by how good this sounds. I suppose it's a $3,500 headset.

1006
01:01:27,455 --> 01:01:30,365
Speaker 2:  Again, it's a thing on your face. There are a lot of microphones, apple's

1007
01:01:30,365 --> 01:01:34,165
Speaker 2:  pretty good at noise cancellation. I sort of figured this would be just in

1008
01:01:34,165 --> 01:01:38,045
Speaker 2:  terms of raw audio, the best one. but it is,

1009
01:01:38,125 --> 01:01:42,045
Speaker 2:  I I would say like a full leap be above anything else we've

1010
01:01:42,045 --> 01:01:42,605
Speaker 2:  tested so far

1011
01:01:43,105 --> 01:01:47,045
Speaker 11:  Is surprising just because of how annoying it was to get into this

1012
01:01:47,185 --> 01:01:47,405
Speaker 11:  app.

1013
01:01:48,795 --> 01:01:52,405
Speaker 2:  There's definitely some compression I will say that, that I'm hearing more

1014
01:01:52,405 --> 01:01:56,205
Speaker 2:  and more as you talk. It's doing a lot of the same like processing

1015
01:01:56,225 --> 01:02:00,205
Speaker 2:  and and cancellation stuff, but it still sounds very good and it's,

1016
01:02:00,275 --> 01:02:04,245
Speaker 2:  it's very central. Like you, you are right in the middle of the mix and it,

1017
01:02:04,305 --> 01:02:08,045
Speaker 2:  it sounds like you're talking to me instead of shouting

1018
01:02:08,105 --> 01:02:10,805
Speaker 2:  at a phone from several rooms away, which is very nice.

1019
01:02:11,405 --> 01:02:15,085
Speaker 11:  I will say that whenever I've done my cursed vision Pro

1020
01:02:15,605 --> 01:02:19,405
Speaker 11:  FaceTimes with Wes, everything sounds great. Like, 'cause he's

1021
01:02:19,405 --> 01:02:23,325
Speaker 11:  obviously in the Vision Pro and it using that mic and it's

1022
01:02:23,325 --> 01:02:27,165
Speaker 11:  always sounded like he's in the room with me, which

1023
01:02:27,165 --> 01:02:30,605
Speaker 11:  is uncanny and freaky on top of

1024
01:02:30,945 --> 01:02:32,485
Speaker 11:  his mustache that won't move.

1025
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:36,845
Speaker 2:  Yeah. The real takeaway from this is FaceTime Audio is your friend on

1026
01:02:36,845 --> 01:02:40,805
Speaker 2:  the Vision Pro not FaceTime video and that is, that is the way to

1027
01:02:40,805 --> 01:02:41,885
Speaker 2:  live your life on the Vision Pro.

1028
01:02:42,465 --> 01:02:46,445
Speaker 11:  Now half the time our FaceTimes are like, oh, why do I have

1029
01:02:46,445 --> 01:02:49,965
Speaker 11:  this over my mouth, this cloud because my hand is there.

1030
01:02:50,115 --> 01:02:50,605
Speaker 11:  Alright,

1031
01:02:50,605 --> 01:02:54,285
Speaker 2:  Well it sounds good. Let's, let's get you out of your misery here.

1032
01:02:54,845 --> 01:02:58,325
Speaker 2:  I do, we should, we weren't planning to do this, but we should test AirPods

1033
01:02:58,355 --> 01:03:01,805
Speaker 2:  last just as kind of a control on the rest of it. Do you have a pair of AirPods

1034
01:03:01,805 --> 01:03:02,205
Speaker 2:  lying around?

1035
01:03:02,605 --> 01:03:02,885
Speaker 11:  I do.

1036
01:03:02,955 --> 01:03:06,605
Speaker 2:  Alright, let's go get those, take off this Godforsaken headset

1037
01:03:07,425 --> 01:03:08,605
Speaker 2:  and let's, let's try those.

1038
01:03:08,895 --> 01:03:11,565
Speaker 11:  Thank you. Thank you for letting me leave virtual jail.

1039
01:03:19,285 --> 01:03:22,525
Speaker 13:  I don't know what is happening right now, but your voice is sped up like

1040
01:03:23,875 --> 01:03:25,165
Speaker 2:  Like a hundred x. Yeah,

1041
01:03:27,625 --> 01:03:30,765
Speaker 13:  I'm gonna have to kick you out V and then you're gonna have to come back

1042
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:33,645
Speaker 13:  in. I can't even understand what you're saying. Yeah, I got

1043
01:03:33,645 --> 01:03:37,525
Speaker 2:  Nothing. Yeah, just kick her out. Yeah. V you're back with AirPods on

1044
01:03:37,785 --> 01:03:41,765
Speaker 12:  My AirPods Pro USBC version. So I guess the

1045
01:03:41,765 --> 01:03:43,725
Speaker 12:  latest versions of the AirPods Pro You can have.

1046
01:03:44,075 --> 01:03:47,605
Speaker 2:  Okay, so I have to say this is, this sounds comparatively

1047
01:03:47,855 --> 01:03:51,765
Speaker 2:  worse than I actually expected. I would say I would put this

1048
01:03:51,765 --> 01:03:55,485
Speaker 2:  like pretty close to the very first,

1049
01:03:55,545 --> 01:03:58,725
Speaker 2:  the Razer ones that we listen to in the sense that it is, it kind of sounds

1050
01:03:58,725 --> 01:04:02,005
Speaker 2:  like a far away omnidirectional microphone and like You sound fine, I can

1051
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:05,685
Speaker 2:  hear you, I can hear everything you're saying, but like, I expected

1052
01:04:05,955 --> 01:04:08,885
Speaker 2:  this to come on and me to be like, oh yeah, this sounds kind of like the

1053
01:04:09,105 --> 01:04:12,645
Speaker 2:  The Ray band Smart glasses. This is like demonstrably worse than those, at

1054
01:04:12,645 --> 01:04:14,965
Speaker 2:  least to my ears. Andrew, is that, am I way off here?

1055
01:04:15,545 --> 01:04:19,365
Speaker 13:  No, absolutely. I actually would like to hear how the Razer won't sound

1056
01:04:19,365 --> 01:04:23,245
Speaker 13:  again because those were a lot more fuller sounding in a

1057
01:04:23,275 --> 01:04:26,685
Speaker 13:  frequency range than these, these kind of sound pretty tinny actually

1058
01:04:27,345 --> 01:04:28,005
Speaker 13:  in comparison.

1059
01:04:28,475 --> 01:04:32,325
Speaker 12:  Yeah, I mean I, I do have an assortment of just gadgets in my

1060
01:04:32,505 --> 01:04:36,405
Speaker 12:  strewn across my room, which is like my office rather, which

1061
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:40,365
Speaker 12:  is a fricking, it's a disaster zone, it's like late in

1062
01:04:40,365 --> 01:04:43,845
Speaker 12:  the week, so I haven't put my gadgets away like a naughty, naughty gadget

1063
01:04:43,845 --> 01:04:47,605
Speaker 12:  reviewer. So it's, it's literally right here. I could put them back on if

1064
01:04:47,605 --> 01:04:47,685
Speaker 12:  you

1065
01:04:47,685 --> 01:04:49,365
Speaker 13:  Want. Let's, let's do it really quickly. Yeah,

1066
01:04:49,365 --> 01:04:51,765
Speaker 2:  Let's just do it. Yeah, just really, really quick and then we'll let you

1067
01:04:51,765 --> 01:04:51,885
Speaker 2:  go.

1068
01:04:52,195 --> 01:04:55,725
Speaker 12:  Okay. All right. I'm back in these

1069
01:04:55,995 --> 01:04:59,925
Speaker 12:  glasses, which you guys say look fine on me, but I think I look a little

1070
01:05:00,195 --> 01:05:02,725
Speaker 12:  like, I look a little bit like the grandpa from Up,

1071
01:05:05,295 --> 01:05:08,485
Speaker 2:  First of all. That's a compliment. You should be psyched to look like the

1072
01:05:08,485 --> 01:05:12,445
Speaker 2:  grandpa from Up, but yeah, Andrew, I'm, I'm kind of hearing what it sounds

1073
01:05:12,445 --> 01:05:16,325
Speaker 2:  like you were saying that like this is a little fuller, but to

1074
01:05:16,325 --> 01:05:19,965
Speaker 2:  me a little sort of further back where like, it, it sounds further away

1075
01:05:20,785 --> 01:05:22,445
Speaker 2:  but in a certain sense better.

1076
01:05:22,995 --> 01:05:26,885
Speaker 13:  Yeah, so it's probably like their worst microphones, but they

1077
01:05:26,885 --> 01:05:30,525
Speaker 13:  are closer to the face so you get a little more detail

1078
01:05:30,745 --> 01:05:32,525
Speaker 13:  of what's saying. I mean,

1079
01:05:32,525 --> 01:05:32,685
Speaker 12:  Yeah,

1080
01:05:32,955 --> 01:05:36,725
Speaker 13:  There's a trade off there, but like if I'm on a call, like I would almost

1081
01:05:36,745 --> 01:05:40,045
Speaker 13:  prefer these not on a podcast but in a meeting. Yeah,

1082
01:05:40,355 --> 01:05:44,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah. You do sound clearer in this. Like I, I feel like I

1083
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:47,925
Speaker 2:  hear your voice more clearly. It just sounds to me like you're further

1084
01:05:48,115 --> 01:05:51,685
Speaker 2:  away from it. That's really interesting. Big win for headsets today.

1085
01:05:52,205 --> 01:05:54,925
Speaker 2:  I expected AirPods to come somewhere in the middle, but I think you could

1086
01:05:54,925 --> 01:05:58,125
Speaker 2:  make a pretty compelling case that all four of the things you just tried

1087
01:05:58,145 --> 01:06:02,125
Speaker 2:  are better microphones for talking to people than

1088
01:06:02,485 --> 01:06:03,325
Speaker 2:  a pair of AirPods.

1089
01:06:03,665 --> 01:06:07,525
Speaker 12:  Wow. That's a, that's a big boon to the smart glasses category.

1090
01:06:08,075 --> 01:06:11,565
Speaker 2:  Yeah, right. This is also a big win for you and me wearing glasses,

1091
01:06:11,795 --> 01:06:15,165
Speaker 2:  walking around talking to ourselves like maniacs kind of situation.

1092
01:06:15,505 --> 01:06:19,325
Speaker 12:  You know, my neighbors have seen me do walk and talk like just

1093
01:06:19,355 --> 01:06:23,205
Speaker 12:  filming social videos and just, I did a social video while doing a

1094
01:06:23,205 --> 01:06:26,845
Speaker 12:  walk and talk and someone was just like, this, this hoe

1095
01:06:26,905 --> 01:06:30,885
Speaker 12:  really just be walking out here talking to, to thin

1096
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:34,805
Speaker 12:  air. And I was just like, yeah, you know what, This is the future baby.

1097
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:36,485
Speaker 12:  Everything is a microphone.

1098
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:39,645
Speaker 2:  I really hope you say that to people. You just say This is the future baby

1099
01:06:39,645 --> 01:06:43,205
Speaker 2:  and then you just high five them and move on. I. love it. Alright, well we

1100
01:06:43,235 --> 01:06:47,165
Speaker 2:  need to get outta here, but big giant win for smart glasses today. I'm gonna

1101
01:06:47,185 --> 01:06:50,445
Speaker 2:  say in terms of like the combination of

1102
01:06:51,145 --> 01:06:55,085
Speaker 2:  you don't look like a lunatic and you sound

1103
01:06:55,085 --> 01:06:58,925
Speaker 2:  pretty good. I think the metas smartt glasses here are probably the winner

1104
01:06:58,985 --> 01:07:02,245
Speaker 2:  for me in terms of like, what would I tell you to go get for a good microphone?

1105
01:07:02,245 --> 01:07:03,165
Speaker 2:  Andrew, what's your read?

1106
01:07:03,625 --> 01:07:07,365
Speaker 13:  Yes, I would like to note that. V how much are the Razer

1107
01:07:07,585 --> 01:07:09,325
Speaker 13:  and zoo, how much do they cost

1108
01:07:09,865 --> 01:07:13,645
Speaker 12:  On Amazon? You can get them for $40. Jesus Christ,

1109
01:07:13,645 --> 01:07:15,205
Speaker 12:  right? That's pretty cheap.

1110
01:07:15,385 --> 01:07:16,845
Speaker 13:  That's really cheap for that.

1111
01:07:17,195 --> 01:07:18,245
Speaker 2:  That is really cheap.

1112
01:07:18,585 --> 01:07:22,285
Speaker 13:  If someone was like, should I get the $250

1113
01:07:22,915 --> 01:07:26,765
Speaker 13:  meta glasses or should I get these $40 glasses and I can take calls with,

1114
01:07:27,125 --> 01:07:28,165
Speaker 13:  I might just say get those.

1115
01:07:28,715 --> 01:07:31,925
Speaker 2:  That is fair. That's a big price difference. The meta ones definitely sound

1116
01:07:31,925 --> 01:07:35,685
Speaker 2:  better, but yeah, for, for 50 bucks as a, as a thing to just

1117
01:07:35,685 --> 01:07:38,805
Speaker 2:  throw on when you have a phone call, the, the Razer one's not a terrible

1118
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:39,125
Speaker 2:  choice,

1119
01:07:39,785 --> 01:07:43,645
Speaker 12:  So that's shocking to me. That's like, obviously I've tested these a long

1120
01:07:43,645 --> 01:07:47,045
Speaker 12:  time ago so I didn't remember, but that's just a wow.

1121
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:48,565
Speaker 12:  Talk about bank for your book.

1122
01:07:48,945 --> 01:07:52,805
Speaker 2:  The thing that I use the the Meta smart glasses for a lot is it's like

1123
01:07:52,885 --> 01:07:55,765
Speaker 2:  I, I've had, I had, I was in a car accident a couple weeks ago, so I spent

1124
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:59,725
Speaker 2:  a lot of time on hold with the claims department and rather than wear

1125
01:07:59,725 --> 01:08:03,565
Speaker 2:  headphones I can just like throw them on and sit on hold and then I can like

1126
01:08:03,565 --> 01:08:07,325
Speaker 2:  listen to music in the room or whatever. And actually for sitting on

1127
01:08:07,325 --> 01:08:10,885
Speaker 2:  hold a pair of smart glasses is like weirdly great. So I think in, in that

1128
01:08:10,885 --> 01:08:14,525
Speaker 2:  case again, like the, the $50 anus are are also a pretty solid

1129
01:11:59,355 --> 01:12:02,885
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. All right, let's get to the hotline as always. The number is

1136
01:12:26,255 --> 01:12:28,165
Speaker 2:  which seemed fitting about glasses.

1137
01:12:29,585 --> 01:12:33,525
Speaker 19:  Hey David, it's Ruby from the uk. I

1138
01:12:33,915 --> 01:12:37,885
Speaker 19:  have bad eyesight and I wear glasses all the time and it's getting to

1139
01:12:37,885 --> 01:12:41,805
Speaker 19:  the point where I really need new glasses, but I told myself I

1140
01:12:41,805 --> 01:12:45,245
Speaker 19:  wouldn't buy new frames unless they wear smart glasses.

1141
01:12:45,885 --> 01:12:49,845
Speaker 19:  I don't like meta. So those are outta the question, but I don't know if

1142
01:12:49,845 --> 01:12:53,445
Speaker 19:  it was you, but The Verge reviewed a pair of smart glasses called focals

1143
01:12:53,445 --> 01:12:56,685
Speaker 19:  by a company called North. It got bought by Google and they had a little

1144
01:12:56,685 --> 01:13:00,525
Speaker 19:  laser projector that just gave you a hu and from those reviews

1145
01:13:00,585 --> 01:13:04,485
Speaker 19:  it looked pretty cool. Do you think that's maybe something we might see

1146
01:13:04,485 --> 01:13:08,405
Speaker 19:  in the near future and maybe even an AI version of it? That's

1147
01:13:08,585 --> 01:13:10,405
Speaker 19:  not stupid. Thanks and take care.

1148
01:13:11,035 --> 01:13:14,645
Speaker 2:  Okay, so real quick, if you don't remember the North focals and you'd be

1149
01:13:14,645 --> 01:13:17,885
Speaker 2:  forgiven for not remembering the North Focals. Basically the way that they

1150
01:13:17,885 --> 01:13:21,845
Speaker 2:  worked was instead of being two screens in front of your eyes, there was

1151
01:13:21,925 --> 01:13:25,565
Speaker 2:  a little laser projector off to the right, I think

1152
01:13:25,825 --> 01:13:29,725
Speaker 2:  of the glasses. So it would project the laser onto this

1153
01:13:29,725 --> 01:13:33,205
Speaker 2:  little polymer in the middle of the right lens,

1154
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:37,525
Speaker 2:  which would then reflect that light back into your eyes. So instead of looking

1155
01:13:37,545 --> 01:13:41,245
Speaker 2:  at a screen, you were getting what mounted to, I think it was a 300 pixel

1156
01:13:41,305 --> 01:13:45,245
Speaker 2:  by 300 pixel display kind of right in the middle of

1157
01:13:45,245 --> 01:13:48,045
Speaker 2:  your right eye. And you could see through it when it wasn't projecting, it

1158
01:13:48,045 --> 01:13:51,885
Speaker 2:  looked just like a little smudge on the lens itself. It was a very

1159
01:13:51,885 --> 01:13:55,765
Speaker 2:  clever system. North had a real problem making

1160
01:13:55,775 --> 01:13:59,565
Speaker 2:  these things work though for one, it's expensive technology, it's a startup.

1161
01:13:59,875 --> 01:14:02,645
Speaker 2:  They ended up trying to sell these things I think for a thousand dollars,

1162
01:14:02,735 --> 01:14:06,325
Speaker 2:  which most people are just not gonna spend a thousand dollars on a pair of

1163
01:14:06,325 --> 01:14:10,285
Speaker 2:  glasses. Google ended up buying North, I think mostly for the technology,

1164
01:14:10,345 --> 01:14:14,165
Speaker 2:  but obviously Google has a complicated relationship with smart

1165
01:14:14,165 --> 01:14:17,965
Speaker 2:  glasses all the way back to Google Glass. I do think the company is

1166
01:14:17,965 --> 01:14:21,765
Speaker 2:  committed to doing some kind of ar XR thing. The company keeps

1167
01:14:22,115 --> 01:14:25,485
Speaker 2:  teasing it and talking about it. There was that thing in the Project

1168
01:14:26,075 --> 01:14:30,045
Speaker 2:  ASRA video where You can see the glasses like it's, it's out there. Google

1169
01:14:30,185 --> 01:14:33,925
Speaker 2:  is still thinking about this stuff. But what North did was really

1170
01:14:33,925 --> 01:14:37,605
Speaker 2:  clever, honestly, and I'm sort of sad to have seen the company go, but it

1171
01:14:37,605 --> 01:14:41,565
Speaker 2:  was tough, right? Not only was it really expensive, but North famously had

1172
01:14:41,565 --> 01:14:45,445
Speaker 2:  trouble with people with longer eyelashes and evidently

1173
01:14:45,505 --> 01:14:49,125
Speaker 2:  the display struggled when people were wearing

1174
01:14:49,435 --> 01:14:53,125
Speaker 2:  mascara. So this stuff is hard is my point. It's hard

1175
01:14:53,225 --> 01:14:57,165
Speaker 2:  and it's expensive and there is just not a lot of progress

1176
01:14:57,165 --> 01:15:00,925
Speaker 2:  being made towards putting this kind of technology in something that looks

1177
01:15:00,985 --> 01:15:04,845
Speaker 2:  and feels and costs like a normal pair of glasses. All that

1178
01:15:04,845 --> 01:15:08,725
Speaker 2:  said, I do think something like the focals is

1179
01:15:09,045 --> 01:15:13,005
Speaker 2:  probably where we're headed in the immediate future. Like look, sure,

1180
01:15:13,005 --> 01:15:16,925
Speaker 2:  someday the whole vision pro Meta Quest thing might be the

1181
01:15:16,925 --> 01:15:20,205
Speaker 2:  future, but it's only gonna be the future when those things look like a pair

1182
01:15:20,205 --> 01:15:23,885
Speaker 2:  of glasses. And I think we're just a bunch of huge technical

1183
01:15:23,885 --> 01:15:27,845
Speaker 2:  innovations away from that being the case. So what we're gonna see

1184
01:15:28,035 --> 01:15:31,845
Speaker 2:  instead I think is something that feels more

1185
01:15:31,915 --> 01:15:35,885
Speaker 2:  like a heads up display, right? Something that projects little bits of information

1186
01:15:35,905 --> 01:15:39,885
Speaker 2:  at a time onto your face. And as we've been talking about this whole episode,

1187
01:15:40,025 --> 01:15:43,725
Speaker 2:  if you believe that chat and particular

1188
01:15:43,855 --> 01:15:47,765
Speaker 2:  voice in voice out chat with AI systems is going to be a key part

1189
01:15:47,765 --> 01:15:50,965
Speaker 2:  of how we talk to computers, something like that becomes really powerful,

1190
01:15:50,965 --> 01:15:54,645
Speaker 2:  right? It can display your text message and You can respond to it. It can

1191
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:57,685
Speaker 2:  show you the answer to a question that you asked. It can show you the information

1192
01:15:57,685 --> 01:16:01,605
Speaker 2:  that you asked for. It becomes this really useful thing in a

1193
01:16:01,605 --> 01:16:05,245
Speaker 2:  way that even north five years ago was trying to

1194
01:16:05,435 --> 01:16:09,165
Speaker 2:  like awkwardly rewrite apps to make them make

1195
01:16:09,175 --> 01:16:12,845
Speaker 2:  sense on this tiny display in a way that was just really hard. Now we have

1196
01:16:12,885 --> 01:16:16,805
Speaker 2:  a confluence of things, whether it's voice or we've had

1197
01:16:16,845 --> 01:16:20,765
Speaker 2:  a lot of work with widgets on you know, lock screens and home screens of

1198
01:16:20,765 --> 01:16:24,325
Speaker 2:  phones. That stuff has also been transferred to smart watches

1199
01:16:24,455 --> 01:16:27,725
Speaker 2:  which have made a lot of progress in the last five years. Put all of that

1200
01:16:27,965 --> 01:16:30,925
Speaker 2:  together and You can sort of see how the interface for a pair of glasses

1201
01:16:31,355 --> 01:16:35,245
Speaker 2:  that is just listening to you talk maybe doing some gesture control.

1202
01:16:35,245 --> 01:16:38,605
Speaker 2:  Again, we have these new smart rings like the galaxy ring that are starting

1203
01:16:38,605 --> 01:16:42,285
Speaker 2:  to experiment with maybe You can use your fingers to control devices just

1204
01:16:42,285 --> 01:16:45,485
Speaker 2:  with your hands. Meta is also working on this kind of stuff. Mark Zuckerberg

1205
01:16:45,485 --> 01:16:48,965
Speaker 2:  even said that there is a new wearable that the company has been working

1206
01:16:48,965 --> 01:16:51,965
Speaker 2:  on that it's getting ready to release that is going to be a new way to control

1207
01:16:51,995 --> 01:16:55,885
Speaker 2:  gadgets. So again, all of this is just coming together. The

1208
01:16:56,005 --> 01:16:59,845
Speaker 2:  question is going to be can anyone make a product out of it? Can you

1209
01:16:59,905 --> 01:17:03,365
Speaker 2:  do North's thing where North also had a a little ring

1210
01:17:03,525 --> 01:17:06,925
Speaker 2:  joystick thing that was kind of neat but also kind of got in the way. Can

1211
01:17:06,925 --> 01:17:10,805
Speaker 2:  you do that well with a smart ring? Can you figure out the interface

1212
01:17:10,945 --> 01:17:14,445
Speaker 2:  in a way that is useful and will make people wanna spend the extra money

1213
01:17:14,445 --> 01:17:18,125
Speaker 2:  on it without being too much extra money to the point where people just don't

1214
01:17:18,125 --> 01:17:21,365
Speaker 2:  want it in addition to their regular pair of glasses? Can you make the battery

1215
01:17:21,365 --> 01:17:24,445
Speaker 2:  last long enough that it doesn't feel like I have to charge my glasses twice

1216
01:17:24,525 --> 01:17:27,485
Speaker 2:  a day because that's a terrible experience? And then I think there's the

1217
01:17:27,485 --> 01:17:30,445
Speaker 2:  biggest question, which is just that we haven't solved how any of this is

1218
01:17:30,645 --> 01:17:33,925
Speaker 2:  supposed to work. A Google executive a few years ago said to me that one

1219
01:17:33,925 --> 01:17:37,885
Speaker 2:  of the most challenging things about AR is figuring out kind

1220
01:17:37,885 --> 01:17:41,765
Speaker 2:  of the relative noise level of an AR system. And I mean noise

1221
01:17:41,765 --> 01:17:45,605
Speaker 2:  in the sense of like how in your face it is and involved

1222
01:17:45,625 --> 01:17:49,245
Speaker 2:  it is in your life, right? Sometimes you want lots of information, you want

1223
01:17:49,245 --> 01:17:51,765
Speaker 2:  it to be telling you what's going on around you, you want it to point you

1224
01:17:51,785 --> 01:17:55,605
Speaker 2:  to the coffee shop down the street or the cool place

1225
01:17:55,675 --> 01:17:59,085
Speaker 2:  that you totally should go or the fact that your friend is over there and

1226
01:17:59,085 --> 01:18:03,005
Speaker 2:  then other times you want it to just shut up and go away. And you want

1227
01:18:03,065 --> 01:18:06,965
Speaker 2:  all of that to happen automatically and seamlessly and without you having

1228
01:18:07,065 --> 01:18:07,805
Speaker 2:  to decide

1229
01:18:45,305 --> 01:18:49,165
Speaker 2:  we are as people and how we use technology and what we care about

1230
01:18:49,165 --> 01:18:52,565
Speaker 2:  and what we don't care about. And putting all those pieces together I think

1231
01:18:52,565 --> 01:18:55,765
Speaker 2:  is actually the hardest part of all of this. Because again, you have rings

1232
01:18:55,765 --> 01:18:59,605
Speaker 2:  which I think are doing interesting gesture and sensing stuff, you have other

1233
01:18:59,635 --> 01:19:03,005
Speaker 2:  devices doing that. There's we who knows, we might get like brain computer

1234
01:19:03,005 --> 01:19:06,845
Speaker 2:  interfaces soon enough. I think the glasses technology is getting

1235
01:19:06,845 --> 01:19:10,565
Speaker 2:  better pretty quickly. North's projector was not amazing

1236
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:14,165
Speaker 2:  but it was pretty good and that was a while ago and frankly it's a bummer

1237
01:19:14,165 --> 01:19:18,045
Speaker 2:  that we haven't gotten to see five years of progress there. We also are seeing

1238
01:19:18,685 --> 01:19:22,165
Speaker 2:  companies like Meta really start to bet on the smart glasses space.

1239
01:19:22,645 --> 01:19:25,805
Speaker 2:  I think the idea that we were gonna get headsets and we were all gonna learn

1240
01:19:25,805 --> 01:19:29,525
Speaker 2:  how to live inside of headsets was just the wrong one. And I think even

1241
01:19:29,625 --> 01:19:33,205
Speaker 2:  the success that Meta has said it's seeing from the smart glasses is

1242
01:19:33,335 --> 01:19:37,165
Speaker 2:  proof that what we're doing is saying how do we

1243
01:19:37,245 --> 01:19:40,365
Speaker 2:  make glasses that look like glasses and work like glasses and feel like glasses?

1244
01:19:40,665 --> 01:19:44,165
Speaker 2:  And then how do we make them more useful over time? And I think that is a

1245
01:19:44,165 --> 01:19:47,805
Speaker 2:  really interesting road that is going to lead to interesting things fairly

1246
01:19:47,805 --> 01:19:51,325
Speaker 2:  quickly. So I would say to your question specifically, I think if you need

1247
01:19:51,325 --> 01:19:55,285
Speaker 2:  a pair of glasses today, you should just buy a pair of glasses. There's not

1248
01:19:55,605 --> 01:19:59,205
Speaker 2:  anything that is so smart and so good even at doing

1249
01:19:59,505 --> 01:20:03,405
Speaker 2:  one thing beyond being a pair of glasses that it feels worth making a

1250
01:20:03,405 --> 01:20:07,310
Speaker 2:  huge bet on. But it's kind of like the one after this one, right? Like

1251
01:20:07,355 --> 01:20:11,165
Speaker 2:  someday in, you know, a couple of years when you lose these glasses or

1252
01:20:11,195 --> 01:20:15,165
Speaker 2:  need to increase your prescription or they break or whatever, I think at

1253
01:20:15,165 --> 01:20:18,565
Speaker 2:  that point we might be somewhere where there is a heads up display

1254
01:20:18,945 --> 01:20:22,805
Speaker 2:  in your glasses that is pretty useful. It won't do everything. It won't

1255
01:20:22,805 --> 01:20:26,645
Speaker 2:  be a full on Metaverse AR experience

1256
01:20:26,645 --> 01:20:30,205
Speaker 2:  where You can like play games in the world around you. But it'll be something,

1257
01:20:30,205 --> 01:20:33,285
Speaker 2:  maybe it'll just show you your text messages, but that'll be something and

1258
01:20:33,285 --> 01:20:36,205
Speaker 2:  I think that'll be pretty cool. There are companies out there working on

1259
01:20:36,205 --> 01:20:39,845
Speaker 2:  this. I think Google has intimated that there's stuff going on. There's some

1260
01:20:39,845 --> 01:20:43,645
Speaker 2:  indication from reporting that we've seen from Mark Kerman at Bloomberg and

1261
01:20:43,805 --> 01:20:45,805
Speaker 2:  others that Apple is starting to really work
