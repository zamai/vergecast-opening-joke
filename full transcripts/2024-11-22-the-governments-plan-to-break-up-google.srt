Description: The Verge's Lauren Feiner joins Nilay and David to talk about the US government's proposal in its search antitrust case against Google. They discuss the future of Chrome, what a white-label search engine might look like, and how a Trump administration might change the course of this case altogether. Then Nilay and David talk about the week in AI and gadget news, from the latest on Amazon's new Alexa to Google bailing on tablets all over again. Finally, in the lightning round, they discuss Comcast spinning off its cable channels and the latest in the Threads / Bluesky competition.

2
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:08,845
Speaker 4:  any of them. It seems like a likely outcome here. I mean,

3
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:10,365
Speaker 4:  friend Neil I, David Pierce is here. The

4
00:02:10,365 --> 00:02:14,325
Speaker 2:  Browser wars are just the end of web browsers. So I. Love

5
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:15,205
Speaker 2:  this. This is great.

6
00:02:15,395 --> 00:02:18,925
Speaker 4:  What have we done? Yeah, Lauren finer ISS here. Hey Lauren. Hey,

7
00:02:19,575 --> 00:02:23,325
Speaker 4:  there is a lot of news, A lot of what I would call Lauren finer news

8
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:23,765
Speaker 4:  this week,

9
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:27,445
Speaker 2:  Unfortunately for Lauren Finer every week is that,

10
00:02:27,925 --> 00:02:31,405
Speaker 4:  Especially lately, the DOJ has put forth its proposal

11
00:02:31,745 --> 00:02:35,485
Speaker 4:  for what to do about Google antitrust in search, which involves

12
00:02:35,485 --> 00:02:39,245
Speaker 4:  potentially selling Chrome. Google has reacted to this. There are more

13
00:02:39,245 --> 00:02:43,165
Speaker 4:  antitrust lawsuits Apple is trying to get out of, out of its antitrust lawsuit.

14
00:02:43,845 --> 00:02:47,285
Speaker 4:  There's a bunch of AI chaos or some gadgets. We got a lightning round.

15
00:02:49,155 --> 00:02:51,835
Speaker 4:  I want you to hear the excitement in my voice about the lightning round.

16
00:02:51,935 --> 00:02:54,355
Speaker 4:  You know, it's coming, it's, it's, it's gonna be good.

17
00:02:54,515 --> 00:02:57,195
Speaker 2:  I also have some personal news. Can I tell you my personal news? What's that?

18
00:02:57,395 --> 00:03:00,925
Speaker 2:  I bought an M four Mac mini and it is glorious.

19
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:05,285
Speaker 2:  Liam, our producer, can attest to the number of times I have slacked him

20
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,725
Speaker 2:  over the last two weeks being like, Liam, I'm gonna do it. Talk me out of

21
00:03:07,725 --> 00:03:11,525
Speaker 2:  it. And he keeps not talking me out of it. And so this

22
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:15,405
Speaker 2:  morning I opened up so many browser windows by accident that I

23
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:18,325
Speaker 2:  got very frustrated with my computer and So I went to the Apple store and

24
00:03:18,325 --> 00:03:18,725
Speaker 2:  bought a Mac.

25
00:03:18,925 --> 00:03:22,645
Speaker 4:  Alright, let me just pull upon a few themes, few core vergecast themes

26
00:03:22,675 --> 00:03:26,405
Speaker 4:  here. David who had an M1 MAC mini on which he mostly

27
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:30,645
Speaker 4:  does this, which was fine. It was fine, right? It was like not terrific

28
00:03:30,965 --> 00:03:31,085
Speaker 2:  Computer,

29
00:03:31,335 --> 00:03:34,765
Speaker 4:  Right? And you bought a new computer that is

30
00:03:34,945 --> 00:03:38,805
Speaker 4:  vastly faster than what you need. Because after years

31
00:03:38,865 --> 00:03:42,685
Speaker 4:  of insisting eight gigs of RAM was enough, you ran outta

32
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:46,525
Speaker 4:  memory and your computer slowed down. So you went and bought an entirely

33
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,925
Speaker 4:  new computer to get eight gigs more ram.

34
00:03:49,475 --> 00:03:52,485
Speaker 2:  Okay, I've I have several responses. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

35
00:03:53,615 --> 00:03:56,645
Speaker 2:  Eight gigs of memory is fine. No If, you were a regular person.

36
00:03:56,825 --> 00:03:58,685
Speaker 4:  You just bought a new computer I

37
00:03:58,945 --> 00:03:59,165
Speaker 2:  In.

38
00:03:59,265 --> 00:04:02,125
Speaker 4:  No, your M1 MacMini was not slow for this purpose.

39
00:04:03,105 --> 00:04:07,005
Speaker 2:  In no way, shape or form should other people make computer purchasing

40
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,885
Speaker 2:  decisions based on how I use browser taps. Like no one,

41
00:04:11,145 --> 00:04:14,405
Speaker 2:  the only person in my life I've met who is worse about browser tabs than

42
00:04:14,445 --> 00:04:17,085
Speaker 2:  I am is Addie Robertson. But you are the person who sat down next to me last

43
00:04:17,085 --> 00:04:19,365
Speaker 2:  week and I went, oh my god, that's so many tabs.

44
00:04:19,645 --> 00:04:23,005
Speaker 4:  Right? And ADDIE is smart and good at buying computers and probably bought

45
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:26,925
Speaker 4:  a computer 16 gigs of ram. Whereas you were like, most normals need eight

46
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:30,885
Speaker 4:  gigs of ram I, David Pierce, tab assassin are going to

47
00:04:31,345 --> 00:04:34,285
Speaker 4:  buy a computer eight gigs of RAM and then unnecessarily buy new.

48
00:04:34,805 --> 00:04:37,525
Speaker 2:  I had to choose between being good at life and having a powerful computer.

49
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:39,525
Speaker 2:  And I picked powerful computer. Like it just, this is self I

50
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:40,045
Speaker 4:  I also

51
00:04:40,095 --> 00:04:40,445
Speaker 2:  Point

52
00:04:40,445 --> 00:04:42,325
Speaker 4:  Out self knowledge that you refuse to buy a good tv.

53
00:04:43,115 --> 00:04:44,525
Speaker 2:  Yeah, no. That I still feel good about.

54
00:04:45,145 --> 00:04:49,115
Speaker 4:  All right. Still feel solid. It's a mess. I'm, I'm proud of you. One's it

55
00:04:49,115 --> 00:04:49,715
Speaker 4:  coming. Thank you.

56
00:04:50,065 --> 00:04:51,235
Speaker 2:  It's here. I'm on it right now.

57
00:04:51,735 --> 00:04:52,355
Speaker 4:  Oh you look great.

58
00:04:52,455 --> 00:04:55,755
Speaker 2:  If you're like, gosh, David is so much smarter and more attractive than he

59
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:58,595
Speaker 2:  usually is on The Vergecast, this is it. We did it.

60
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:02,915
Speaker 4:  It's all, I mean I've spent a lot of time thinking about buying an M four

61
00:05:02,915 --> 00:05:06,835
Speaker 4:  Mac mini, but to do that I have to convert one of my old IMAX into a

62
00:05:06,835 --> 00:05:10,315
Speaker 4:  monitor, which more and more people I will say out there

63
00:05:10,655 --> 00:05:14,405
Speaker 4:  are, are talking about, oh yeah, I wouldn't say doing right.

64
00:05:14,785 --> 00:05:18,565
Speaker 4:  But now that I've opened the door to hey, what if we all broke our

65
00:05:18,755 --> 00:05:22,005
Speaker 4:  IMAX trying to turn in monitors more people, more and more people are like,

66
00:05:22,635 --> 00:05:24,725
Speaker 4:  will you do it first so that I can see if it works?

67
00:05:24,935 --> 00:05:28,885
Speaker 2:  We've definitely successfully made the business case for our roving

68
00:05:29,465 --> 00:05:33,205
Speaker 2:  RV in which we will do this process for you. It's ready.

69
00:05:33,485 --> 00:05:33,765
Speaker 2:  I will

70
00:05:33,765 --> 00:05:37,685
Speaker 4:  Drive to your house in a van and break your old computer. That is the only

71
00:05:37,685 --> 00:05:40,605
Speaker 4:  promise I will make. The listeners of The Vergecast. Perfect. Some of you

72
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:43,915
Speaker 4:  will come out of it with a monitor. Most of you will not. It's

73
00:05:43,915 --> 00:05:44,995
Speaker 2:  About the friends we made along the way.

74
00:05:45,185 --> 00:05:48,355
Speaker 4:  Will we spend time together in a van? Yeah. That is a guarantee.

75
00:05:51,415 --> 00:05:55,375
Speaker 4:  I'm just saying when I was a child, my, my father owned not one

76
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:58,965
Speaker 4:  but two different conversion vans. They were great and I think they should

77
00:05:58,965 --> 00:06:02,565
Speaker 4:  come back as a market. And the specific market I'm proposing

78
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:06,405
Speaker 4:  is the back of the van is where we hang out and play video games. And the

79
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:08,525
Speaker 4:  front of the van is where I break your old iMac.

80
00:06:08,825 --> 00:06:09,405
Speaker 2:  Oh, I like that.

81
00:06:09,585 --> 00:06:11,925
Speaker 4:  Do you see what I'm saying? Yeah. It's like inside of captain's chairs, there's

82
00:06:11,925 --> 00:06:15,485
Speaker 4:  like a little lab situation and the back is like couches

83
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,965
Speaker 4:  a good tv, David, some game consoles,

84
00:06:20,145 --> 00:06:22,405
Speaker 4:  I'm not sure this is gonna work. And mostly it'll probably just get me arrested

85
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:24,325
Speaker 4:  'cause I'll be driving around and be like, I'd like to break your computer

86
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:25,925
Speaker 4:  and play video games with you in my band.

87
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:29,965
Speaker 2:  So it's transparency. It gives, it gives you everywhere. Yeah. and we'll

88
00:06:29,965 --> 00:06:32,125
Speaker 2:  make content about it and be huge on TikTok and it'll be fine.

89
00:06:33,345 --> 00:06:37,325
Speaker 4:  That's finally, finally a business model of media. That makes sense. Alright,

90
00:06:37,325 --> 00:06:40,885
Speaker 4:  we should get into the news. There's a lot to talk about. Lauren, let's start

91
00:06:40,885 --> 00:06:44,685
Speaker 4:  with the DOJ in Google. Just to lay some foundation for

92
00:06:44,685 --> 00:06:44,925
Speaker 4:  folks.

93
00:06:46,485 --> 00:06:49,525
Speaker 4:  I wanna talk about the, the proposal this week. There are multiple

94
00:06:49,955 --> 00:06:53,925
Speaker 4:  antitrust lawsuits against Google and it's, it's actually, I find

95
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:57,685
Speaker 4:  it quite difficult to keep them all apart because it's not

96
00:06:57,685 --> 00:07:01,245
Speaker 4:  clear how all of the things that happen will ultimately

97
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:05,685
Speaker 4:  play out and make a new Google. And then on top of it there's a

98
00:07:05,685 --> 00:07:09,645
Speaker 4:  new president and a new administration and a new

99
00:07:09,965 --> 00:07:12,845
Speaker 4:  attorney general. Although Mac Gates dropped out like minutes before we started

100
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:15,085
Speaker 4:  recording So. I don't even know who the attorney general's gonna be,

101
00:07:16,985 --> 00:07:20,445
Speaker 4:  but there's the one we're talking about today, which was the Google pays

102
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:24,245
Speaker 4:  apple money for search defaults in safari. Google

103
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:28,285
Speaker 4:  was found guilty of having a monopoly in search. And the

104
00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:32,045
Speaker 4:  remedies are at this. There's another case which is what advertising right

105
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:32,325
Speaker 4:  Lauren?

106
00:07:32,475 --> 00:07:36,285
Speaker 5:  Yeah. The ad tech industry. And that one is going to closing

107
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:40,525
Speaker 5:  arguments on Monday back in Alexandria, Virginia. And that's all about

108
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:44,405
Speaker 5:  Google. How Google connects publishers and advertisers

109
00:07:44,405 --> 00:07:45,765
Speaker 5:  through its tech. That

110
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:49,245
Speaker 2:  One's the much Wonkier one. Yes. But also maybe the more important

111
00:07:49,265 --> 00:07:50,685
Speaker 4:  One because it's the money. Yeah,

112
00:07:50,795 --> 00:07:51,285
Speaker 5:  Exactly.

113
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:55,565
Speaker 4:  So I just wanna like start there. There's a lot of activity around

114
00:07:55,565 --> 00:07:58,845
Speaker 4:  Google's business and how it all works together. And the reason I wanna start

115
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:02,775
Speaker 4:  there is all of that flows through Chrome, right? At the end of the

116
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:06,735
Speaker 4:  day, Google's ad tech is worthless unless there are web browsers

117
00:08:06,885 --> 00:08:10,735
Speaker 4:  that show you hats and Google has the biggest one and

118
00:08:10,995 --> 00:08:13,695
Speaker 4:  at the end of the day, the reason it's paying for a default placement in

119
00:08:13,695 --> 00:08:17,055
Speaker 4:  other browsers is because it can't run Chrome on the iPhone.

120
00:08:17,515 --> 00:08:20,815
Speaker 4:  So it just pays Apple to do what it does on the desktop in Chrome. So that,

121
00:08:20,895 --> 00:08:24,655
Speaker 4:  I just want to lay all that out. Like there's a lot of swirling activity

122
00:08:24,655 --> 00:08:28,175
Speaker 4:  around Google and we're facing down this proposal

123
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:32,215
Speaker 4:  inside of one case, but I'm not sure how it will affect the other case and

124
00:08:32,215 --> 00:08:35,575
Speaker 4:  we won't know because it's just a closing arguments. Oh and then this, by

125
00:08:35,575 --> 00:08:39,495
Speaker 4:  the way, this trial, there's so much, it's so confusing. This trial is

126
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:43,535
Speaker 4:  not even over. Yeah. This is just a proposal and then there's gonna be another

127
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:45,815
Speaker 4:  trial to debate this proposal.

128
00:08:46,905 --> 00:08:50,615
Speaker 5:  Right? Right. So I mean, just to give you a sense of kind of the timeline

129
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:54,215
Speaker 5:  of both of these cases here. Like the ad tech case is gonna closing

130
00:08:54,495 --> 00:08:57,245
Speaker 5:  arguments on Monday and then we go,

131
00:08:58,475 --> 00:09:02,325
Speaker 5:  then we might get a decision in that case by like the end of the

132
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:06,205
Speaker 5:  year. And then that goes to the remedies phase.

133
00:09:06,465 --> 00:09:09,645
Speaker 5:  If the judge says that Google is a monopolist in that case.

134
00:09:10,385 --> 00:09:14,285
Speaker 5:  And then we'll have to schedule that. And then in April we have

135
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:17,805
Speaker 5:  the remedies trial in the search case in DC So,

136
00:09:18,145 --> 00:09:22,005
Speaker 5:  and then after all of that, you know we, we know Google wants to

137
00:09:22,005 --> 00:09:25,765
Speaker 5:  appeal the search case and I'd imagine whoever loses in the ad tech case

138
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:29,605
Speaker 5:  is gonna wanna appeal there. So this is not happening very soon.

139
00:09:30,305 --> 00:09:30,525
Speaker 5:  No,

140
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:34,805
Speaker 4:  But so it's, it's just a mess. 'cause I've seen people react to the

141
00:09:34,805 --> 00:09:38,485
Speaker 4:  news today about Chrome is, Google's gonna have to sell Chrome and that's

142
00:09:38,485 --> 00:09:42,325
Speaker 4:  just not where we are. It's this government is currently composed in the

143
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:46,245
Speaker 4:  Biden administration has put forward this proposal. Many things will

144
00:09:46,245 --> 00:09:49,405
Speaker 4:  happen including the inauguration of Donald Trump and whoever his attorney

145
00:09:49,405 --> 00:09:53,245
Speaker 4:  general is being confirmed and all. And then further trials in April.

146
00:09:53,945 --> 00:09:57,845
Speaker 4:  So I, just that's the foundation. I, so we're gonna talk about this 'cause

147
00:09:57,845 --> 00:10:01,045
Speaker 4:  the ideas are really interesting, but I, I just want people to know like

148
00:10:01,195 --> 00:10:05,005
Speaker 4:  nothing is happening. Like we're, we're a long way from from

149
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:07,845
Speaker 4:  here to there. So talk about this proposal. So the, the Justice Department

150
00:10:07,845 --> 00:10:09,125
Speaker 4:  put out this proposal. What's in it?

151
00:10:09,395 --> 00:10:13,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah, so the proposal that the DOJ put out, it's their kind of initial

152
00:10:14,205 --> 00:10:17,565
Speaker 5:  proposed final judgment. So this is, you know, them saying to the judge,

153
00:10:17,635 --> 00:10:21,325
Speaker 5:  this is what we want you to do. This is what we want you to tell

154
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:25,085
Speaker 5:  Google that they have to do in order to restore competition to the

155
00:10:25,085 --> 00:10:29,045
Speaker 5:  online search market. And so basically, you know, they

156
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:33,005
Speaker 5:  had filed a kind of high level version of this not that

157
00:10:33,005 --> 00:10:36,085
Speaker 5:  long ago and it was sort of like, here's what we're kind of thinking about

158
00:10:36,305 --> 00:10:38,965
Speaker 5:  and you know, we're looking at Chrome, we're looking at Android, we're looking

159
00:10:38,965 --> 00:10:42,605
Speaker 5:  at all these other things. This is like the more concrete version of that

160
00:10:42,605 --> 00:10:46,365
Speaker 5:  where they're saying, you know, this is what we intend to ask

161
00:10:46,385 --> 00:10:50,365
Speaker 5:  for in this trial and you know, they're gonna get to go through a whole

162
00:10:50,365 --> 00:10:54,245
Speaker 5:  discovery process around this too. So now we can see that

163
00:10:54,395 --> 00:10:58,245
Speaker 5:  they are saying that they feel strongly that Google

164
00:10:58,355 --> 00:11:02,205
Speaker 5:  must divest Chrome. It's not just an option that's on the

165
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:05,725
Speaker 5:  table. They think that this is a critical access point for

166
00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:09,285
Speaker 5:  Google search that needs to be separated from the company.

167
00:11:09,945 --> 00:11:12,605
Speaker 5:  And then on top of that, you know, they also considered

168
00:11:13,435 --> 00:11:17,405
Speaker 5:  divesting having Google divest Android, but they're kind of

169
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:20,965
Speaker 5:  I guess holding their fire on that for now, but they're leaving it on the

170
00:11:20,965 --> 00:11:24,765
Speaker 5:  table. So it's kind of an incentive for Google to comply with the rest of

171
00:11:24,765 --> 00:11:28,645
Speaker 5:  the remedies that they're proposing. And it's also, you know, something that

172
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:32,485
Speaker 5:  they can turn to if they say, you know what these other remedies aren't actually

173
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:34,045
Speaker 5:  working to restore competition in the

174
00:11:34,045 --> 00:11:36,845
Speaker 2:  Market. Yeah. They're pretty deliberately hanging that over Google's head.

175
00:11:36,845 --> 00:11:39,245
Speaker 2:  Right? They're like Right, you can do all of these other

176
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:44,695
Speaker 2:  hugely consequential things that you've only begun to list, which is

177
00:11:44,695 --> 00:11:48,535
Speaker 2:  insane but If, you don't do them like the, the

178
00:11:48,535 --> 00:11:51,535
Speaker 2:  big gun is we will take Android away from you. Right. That was the, that's

179
00:11:51,595 --> 00:11:54,725
Speaker 2:  the, it's just like this looming threat throughout this entire filing.

180
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:59,205
Speaker 5:  Yeah and I think what really comes through in this filing is that, you know,

181
00:11:59,265 --> 00:12:03,205
Speaker 5:  the DOJ really wants to have, you know, as

182
00:12:03,205 --> 00:12:06,925
Speaker 5:  many options that it can have available to to them

183
00:12:07,065 --> 00:12:10,725
Speaker 5:  on the table. You know, they don't wanna end up in a situation where,

184
00:12:11,305 --> 00:12:15,085
Speaker 5:  you know, some of the remedies they propose don't work or you know, the landscape

185
00:12:15,085 --> 00:12:18,845
Speaker 5:  changed such that none of these things really matter anymore because we know

186
00:12:18,845 --> 00:12:22,605
Speaker 5:  this is gonna take years and we know that AI is going to become

187
00:12:22,845 --> 00:12:26,645
Speaker 5:  a very important part of search. So they are clearly

188
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:30,485
Speaker 5:  trying to be very deliberate in making sure that anything they ask the judge

189
00:12:30,485 --> 00:12:33,165
Speaker 5:  to impose isn't something that's gonna be obsolete tomorrow.

190
00:12:33,745 --> 00:12:37,685
Speaker 4:  So Chrome is I think the highlight by far. It's the easiest one

191
00:12:37,685 --> 00:12:41,485
Speaker 4:  that for people to understand the looming threat of we will take

192
00:12:41,485 --> 00:12:44,485
Speaker 4:  Android away from you. I think also pretty easy to understand then there's

193
00:12:44,485 --> 00:12:47,805
Speaker 4:  a bunch of other stuff in here. Yeah. Which also seems tremendously impactful

194
00:12:47,865 --> 00:12:51,045
Speaker 4:  but maybe a little bit more opaque. Can you go through those Lauren?

195
00:12:51,515 --> 00:12:55,405
Speaker 5:  Yeah, sure. So, I. Guess just some of the most important ones

196
00:12:55,405 --> 00:12:59,125
Speaker 5:  that come to mind. You know, going back to how this case began,

197
00:12:59,235 --> 00:13:02,645
Speaker 5:  it's really about contracts when you boil it down to it

198
00:13:03,105 --> 00:13:06,765
Speaker 5:  and these contracts are contracts that Google

199
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:10,965
Speaker 5:  has with phone makers and browser makers to be the default

200
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:13,885
Speaker 5:  search engine on those platforms. And

201
00:13:14,905 --> 00:13:18,805
Speaker 5:  the DOJ basically wants to say, alright, Google can't enter

202
00:13:19,155 --> 00:13:23,125
Speaker 5:  into certain exclusionary agreements with those kinds of

203
00:13:23,445 --> 00:13:26,885
Speaker 5:  companies. They can't exchange something of value for

204
00:13:27,155 --> 00:13:30,845
Speaker 5:  like preferred placement or for boxing out rivals from

205
00:13:30,895 --> 00:13:33,965
Speaker 5:  those, those kind of platforms.

206
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:38,405
Speaker 5:  And so, you know, that's kind of like the most straightforward thing that

207
00:13:38,405 --> 00:13:39,125
Speaker 5:  they're asking for

208
00:13:39,425 --> 00:13:42,645
Speaker 2:  And that's kinda what we thought this would boil down to. Right. Like I feel

209
00:13:42,645 --> 00:13:46,005
Speaker 2:  like we've been saying for months that the easiest answer to where would

210
00:13:46,005 --> 00:13:48,845
Speaker 2:  this go is just The government is going to say you're not allowed to make

211
00:13:48,845 --> 00:13:52,325
Speaker 2:  these deals anymore, period. The end. Goodbye. Yeah. And it seems like everyone

212
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:54,765
Speaker 2:  is prepared for that to be an outcome here.

213
00:13:54,955 --> 00:13:58,445
Speaker 5:  Totally. I mean that seems pretty baseline. It's pretty much like exactly

214
00:13:58,445 --> 00:14:02,165
Speaker 5:  what was in the complaint and exactly what the judge ruled was

215
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:06,485
Speaker 5:  some of their anti-competitive behavior. So that seems pretty cut and dry.

216
00:14:07,145 --> 00:14:11,045
Speaker 5:  But at the same time, you know, okay sure. Like Google could stop

217
00:14:11,045 --> 00:14:14,085
Speaker 5:  doing these agreements and then they could figure out another way to be the

218
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:17,805
Speaker 5:  default or to, you know, just maintain their dominance in this area.

219
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:21,725
Speaker 5:  So I think DOJ clearly thinks like that's not enough. That just

220
00:14:21,725 --> 00:14:23,445
Speaker 5:  kind of like stops the bleeding.

221
00:14:24,115 --> 00:14:27,885
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And it's the flip side of that that really gets me reading through

222
00:14:27,885 --> 00:14:31,805
Speaker 2:  this filing that like this whole thing is so much

223
00:14:32,035 --> 00:14:35,885
Speaker 2:  more punishing of Google than I expected it to be. And

224
00:14:35,885 --> 00:14:38,085
Speaker 2:  like I'm not a lawyer and maybe I should have seen this coming, but there

225
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:41,645
Speaker 2:  is a, there is a real thing they're doing in this filing where they're saying,

226
00:14:41,645 --> 00:14:44,725
Speaker 2:  okay, not only do we have to prevent Google from doing these monopolistic

227
00:14:44,725 --> 00:14:48,125
Speaker 2:  things, we have to take aggressive steps to

228
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:52,125
Speaker 2:  unwind all of the things that Google has been doing and the lead it has built

229
00:14:52,595 --> 00:14:56,365
Speaker 2:  over the last 15 years. Like a huge portion of this

230
00:14:56,385 --> 00:14:59,885
Speaker 2:  is just them saying we need to break Google in half and give everybody else

231
00:14:59,885 --> 00:15:03,485
Speaker 2:  every advantage that Google has had in order for them to catch up.

232
00:15:03,775 --> 00:15:05,605
Speaker 2:  Right. Like am I, am I overreading that part?

233
00:15:06,025 --> 00:15:09,725
Speaker 5:  No, I think that's fair. I mean I think a lot of antitrust is kind of

234
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:13,605
Speaker 5:  backward looking by nature and I think, you know, often you hear companies

235
00:15:13,605 --> 00:15:16,765
Speaker 5:  say like, you know, we are not even doing this anymore. Like this is all

236
00:15:16,765 --> 00:15:20,605
Speaker 5:  in the past. And like that might be true, but it doesn't make it, it

237
00:15:20,605 --> 00:15:23,565
Speaker 5:  doesn't mean that their conduct wasn't anti-competitive or that they can't

238
00:15:23,565 --> 00:15:27,405
Speaker 5:  still be held accountable for it. So, and I think, you know,

239
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:30,885
Speaker 5:  the DOJ kind of often talked about in trial how there was this

240
00:15:31,585 --> 00:15:35,245
Speaker 5:  self-reinforcing cycle of Google is

241
00:15:35,565 --> 00:15:38,725
Speaker 5:  a good search engine. So then people come to it and they put in queries and

242
00:15:38,725 --> 00:15:42,685
Speaker 5:  then Google gets data and then it uses that data to make the search engine

243
00:15:42,685 --> 00:15:45,685
Speaker 5:  better and no one else has access to that whole cycle.

244
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:50,685
Speaker 5:  And So I think they really feel like they need to break that cycle somehow

245
00:15:50,945 --> 00:15:52,725
Speaker 5:  for anyone else to even stand a chance.

246
00:15:53,105 --> 00:15:56,245
Speaker 2:  And the way the DOJ is doing that basically seems like it just wants to open

247
00:15:56,245 --> 00:15:59,885
Speaker 2:  source Google now it's basically like all of your query data,

248
00:16:00,235 --> 00:16:04,165
Speaker 2:  your whole search index, your, the information people give you in

249
00:16:04,195 --> 00:16:07,965
Speaker 2:  YouTube searches, all the stuff across all of your surfaces, which is like

250
00:16:08,185 --> 00:16:12,085
Speaker 2:  the internet should be made available. The, what's the

251
00:16:12,085 --> 00:16:15,565
Speaker 2:  phrase they keep using at marginal cost? Just to everyone,

252
00:16:15,705 --> 00:16:19,205
Speaker 2:  anyone, anyone who wants to run a thing that looks and works like Google

253
00:16:19,205 --> 00:16:22,885
Speaker 2:  should be allowed to, is essentially the, the vibe of

254
00:16:22,885 --> 00:16:26,005
Speaker 2:  what's coming here. And that to me is the part that surprised me the most.

255
00:16:26,005 --> 00:16:29,965
Speaker 2:  Like they're just like everything that has made Google special and successful,

256
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:33,485
Speaker 2:  you have to give it to everybody else for free now just so they can catch

257
00:16:33,505 --> 00:16:35,045
Speaker 2:  up. Right. Wild.

258
00:16:35,315 --> 00:16:39,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah. The thing that really strikes me about this is If, you

259
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:42,965
Speaker 4:  just take it at face value. I don't know how Google makes any

260
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:46,735
Speaker 4:  money after this, right? And, and then there's the ad tech case like

261
00:16:46,825 --> 00:16:50,455
Speaker 4:  right next to it, which who knows how that will go, but

262
00:16:50,765 --> 00:16:54,675
Speaker 4:  it's all, that's also a case about contracts and pressure and I

263
00:16:54,675 --> 00:16:58,155
Speaker 4:  just get the sense that it is more likely than not, than Google will face

264
00:16:58,155 --> 00:17:02,075
Speaker 4:  some penalty in that case as well. So who knows. But this part where

265
00:17:02,075 --> 00:17:05,755
Speaker 4:  you're like, you have to stop preferencing Google search

266
00:17:05,895 --> 00:17:09,395
Speaker 4:  on YouTube. Yeah. And let other people search YouTube the way that Google

267
00:17:09,455 --> 00:17:12,755
Speaker 4:  can search YouTube. YouTube is a closed platform.

268
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:13,515
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

269
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:17,875
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I guess I, I think that's, that's a completely fair point, but I

270
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:21,675
Speaker 5:  also wouldn't cry too many tears for Google because I think, you know, they

271
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:24,715
Speaker 5:  will be able to make money off of, you know, selling

272
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:29,155
Speaker 5:  access to these APIs or you know, to their index and

273
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:33,155
Speaker 5:  to their search results and click and query data. And they'll also

274
00:17:33,155 --> 00:17:36,395
Speaker 5:  be able to, you know, they're still gonna be this like

275
00:17:36,785 --> 00:17:40,635
Speaker 5:  amazing huge company full of great engineers and

276
00:17:40,635 --> 00:17:44,075
Speaker 5:  be able to create a product that's really attractive to people in search.

277
00:17:44,215 --> 00:17:45,035
Speaker 5:  So well

278
00:17:45,035 --> 00:17:48,795
Speaker 4:  Just hold on. They are currently an amazing company full of great

279
00:17:49,085 --> 00:17:53,005
Speaker 4:  engineers and their ability to launch great products True at scales,

280
00:17:53,585 --> 00:17:57,245
Speaker 4:  you know, if there's a graveyard for a reason. Yeah. They had a good run

281
00:17:57,275 --> 00:18:00,885
Speaker 4:  back in the day. Like a lot of Google is, you can trace it back to the fact

282
00:18:00,885 --> 00:18:03,885
Speaker 4:  that they have a monopoly in search. It just throws off cash and everything

283
00:18:03,885 --> 00:18:07,085
Speaker 4:  else is like, well whatever We tried messaging apps, you know, like, and

284
00:18:07,155 --> 00:18:10,165
Speaker 4:  this might make it better, it might make it worse. There's just a part of

285
00:18:10,165 --> 00:18:13,965
Speaker 4:  this where I, half of me says this is a negotiation. So you just put

286
00:18:13,965 --> 00:18:17,845
Speaker 4:  forward the most intense first offer that

287
00:18:17,845 --> 00:18:21,565
Speaker 4:  you can make, which is we're gonna break your business in half. And also

288
00:18:21,565 --> 00:18:25,245
Speaker 4:  If, you don't like it, we'll take Android too and then we'll just see where

289
00:18:25,245 --> 00:18:29,045
Speaker 4:  we come back to from there. And then there's a part of me that says we,

290
00:18:29,105 --> 00:18:32,005
Speaker 4:  you know, we sent, we, we just spent a few minutes talking about breaking

291
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:35,125
Speaker 4:  up in Google search and the first part of this offer is we're gonna take

292
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:38,565
Speaker 4:  Chrome away from you. Right. And it's like, oh, this is a complete

293
00:18:39,245 --> 00:18:41,645
Speaker 4:  restructuring of Google, like at every level. Yeah. What we're saying is

294
00:18:41,645 --> 00:18:45,325
Speaker 4:  there should be a search engine that is almost like a

295
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:49,165
Speaker 4:  utility for other people to build search products on top of and

296
00:18:49,165 --> 00:18:52,645
Speaker 4:  other parts of Google, like YouTube need to let other search products come

297
00:18:52,675 --> 00:18:56,245
Speaker 4:  into there. and we are basically gonna take a closed

298
00:18:56,525 --> 00:18:58,805
Speaker 4:  platform in YouTube and make it a more open one, which is really interesting.

299
00:18:59,265 --> 00:19:02,805
Speaker 4:  And then there's, we're gonna take this browser away, which

300
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:07,085
Speaker 4:  is the window to almost your entire ecosystem and someone else

301
00:19:07,155 --> 00:19:11,125
Speaker 4:  will have to buy it, which will accomplish what,

302
00:19:11,695 --> 00:19:15,605
Speaker 4:  right. And there's just a, yeah, those are two pretty different ideas from

303
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:18,525
Speaker 4:  what I can tell. Like you're basically telling Google, you have to be a search

304
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:22,405
Speaker 4:  engine company now and we're gonna prescribe how that search engine company

305
00:19:22,405 --> 00:19:26,275
Speaker 4:  works. And then you're saying we are gonna make

306
00:19:26,395 --> 00:19:30,155
Speaker 4:  a browser company that someone else will buy. And the number one way browser

307
00:19:30,515 --> 00:19:34,395
Speaker 4:  companies make money is by betting paid for default search, which we

308
00:19:34,395 --> 00:19:38,315
Speaker 4:  will no longer allow you to do. And that there, I'm I'm just trying to

309
00:19:38,315 --> 00:19:39,035
Speaker 4:  puzzle all that through.

310
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:43,475
Speaker 5:  Yeah, yeah. I mean there's no doubt this is, you know, a huge swing by

311
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:47,235
Speaker 5:  the DOJ and you know, they, they might not get everything

312
00:19:47,235 --> 00:19:50,795
Speaker 5:  they want. Like you said, this is a negotiation, this is their starting point.

313
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:54,995
Speaker 5:  They're asking for a a lot here and it's

314
00:19:54,995 --> 00:19:58,555
Speaker 5:  gonna be up to the judge to figure out, you know, what is really

315
00:19:58,835 --> 00:20:02,715
Speaker 5:  necessary to restore competition here. And you know, courts really don't

316
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:05,875
Speaker 5:  like to be, you know, playing

317
00:20:06,725 --> 00:20:10,355
Speaker 5:  babysitter or you know, restructuring, like playing

318
00:20:10,775 --> 00:20:10,995
Speaker 5:  the,

319
00:20:12,825 --> 00:20:15,955
Speaker 5:  just really being the hand of God in the market. You know, they're not trying

320
00:20:16,055 --> 00:20:20,035
Speaker 5:  to dictate how the business goes. They're just

321
00:20:20,035 --> 00:20:23,955
Speaker 5:  trying to restore competition to this market. Generally So

322
00:20:24,355 --> 00:20:27,195
Speaker 5:  I think the more that it gets into things that

323
00:20:28,615 --> 00:20:31,875
Speaker 5:  are about picking winners and losers, the more

324
00:20:32,415 --> 00:20:36,035
Speaker 5:  the judge is going to be skeptical and perhaps

325
00:20:36,515 --> 00:20:40,275
Speaker 5:  restrained on those things. So I think it really depends on how well The

326
00:20:40,275 --> 00:20:43,955
Speaker 5:  government makes the case in court for why these sorts of things are

327
00:20:43,955 --> 00:20:44,435
Speaker 5:  necessary.

328
00:20:45,095 --> 00:20:48,805
Speaker 4:  And when I've talked to Jonathan Cantor, who is the assistant attorney general

329
00:20:48,805 --> 00:20:50,245
Speaker 4:  for antitrust who's been leading this case,

330
00:20:51,945 --> 00:20:55,485
Speaker 4:  you can go listen to him on decoder. His point is these consent

331
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:59,365
Speaker 4:  decrees where we make companies promise to behave and then we have to like

332
00:20:59,365 --> 00:21:02,565
Speaker 4:  watch them and go to court when they misbehave don't work. 'cause everyone's

333
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:06,085
Speaker 4:  smart and they can get around it. And what we want is big structural, like

334
00:21:06,085 --> 00:21:09,405
Speaker 4:  you break up the company that's clean, like then it's over and we can just

335
00:21:09,405 --> 00:21:12,365
Speaker 4:  see what happens next. And I, I think courts tend to agree with that because

336
00:21:12,425 --> 00:21:16,265
Speaker 4:  courts the only humility that our judicial system shows

337
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:19,225
Speaker 4:  is like, I shouldn't run your business. And I think it, I can't tell if that's

338
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:22,065
Speaker 4:  humility or laziness or what it is, but that's usually how they respond to

339
00:21:22,065 --> 00:21:25,745
Speaker 4:  that idea of like ongoing compliance. Like the courts don't wanna be in that

340
00:21:25,905 --> 00:21:29,745
Speaker 4:  business. I just think like at the, at the end of this, you

341
00:21:29,745 --> 00:21:32,825
Speaker 4:  look at the amount of change that would be imposed on Google

342
00:21:33,645 --> 00:21:37,305
Speaker 4:  and it Sure. Google will have its opinions. Kent Walker,

343
00:21:37,395 --> 00:21:41,285
Speaker 4:  their chief legal officer put out, you can tell like he's writing

344
00:21:41,605 --> 00:21:44,485
Speaker 4:  directly to Donald Trump. He's like, this is a radical interventionist agenda

345
00:21:44,485 --> 00:21:45,365
Speaker 4:  that will harm America.

346
00:21:45,435 --> 00:21:46,925
Speaker 2:  Like it's pretty saucy. Yeah.

347
00:21:47,965 --> 00:21:51,445
Speaker 4:  Audience of one, like obviously Google's gonna push back against this what

348
00:21:51,445 --> 00:21:55,035
Speaker 4:  happens in the trial, right? Because there's the remedies trial and this

349
00:21:55,035 --> 00:21:57,955
Speaker 4:  is the proposal in the trial. Are they just going to, and they're all just

350
00:21:57,955 --> 00:22:00,635
Speaker 4:  like gonna sit down and be like, this is a bad idea. Do you have to like

351
00:22:00,635 --> 00:22:02,195
Speaker 4:  show proof? Like how does this work?

352
00:22:02,745 --> 00:22:06,395
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I mean, my understanding is there's another discovery process. They

353
00:22:06,395 --> 00:22:09,995
Speaker 5:  get to call in witnesses, so it's gonna be, you know, kinda like the first

354
00:22:10,005 --> 00:22:13,715
Speaker 5:  trial, but this time they kinda have to take as a given that

355
00:22:13,935 --> 00:22:17,755
Speaker 5:  the judge found that Google's Google had an illegal

356
00:22:18,035 --> 00:22:21,715
Speaker 5:  monopoly and they're just talking about what is

357
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:25,315
Speaker 5:  reasonable to impose on Google or not. So

358
00:22:25,425 --> 00:22:28,475
Speaker 5:  yeah, it it's definitely, it's going to be a fight here.

359
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:32,735
Speaker 2:  What's strange to me about this one is it feels like either

360
00:22:32,955 --> 00:22:36,495
Speaker 2:  of the options that the DOJ is presenting here would make sense, right? I

361
00:22:36,495 --> 00:22:40,215
Speaker 2:  think force Google to spin off

362
00:22:40,215 --> 00:22:43,495
Speaker 2:  Android and Chrome into its own company

363
00:22:44,135 --> 00:22:47,855
Speaker 2:  I think is, is I, you can see a world in which that makes sense.

364
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:51,935
Speaker 2:  Both of those are search businesses I would point out, but like there are

365
00:22:51,935 --> 00:22:54,455
Speaker 2:  people who have made a lot of money selling operating systems, right? So

366
00:22:54,455 --> 00:22:57,855
Speaker 2:  like I can you, you can see it, there's a, there's a thing there. Somebody

367
00:22:57,855 --> 00:23:01,495
Speaker 2:  would spin up an app store, it'd be a whole thing. Sure, great fine. Or

368
00:23:01,825 --> 00:23:05,735
Speaker 2:  force Google to essentially white label its search engine and make it

369
00:23:05,735 --> 00:23:09,295
Speaker 2:  available to everybody, right? So now if I wanna run a search engine, all

370
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:13,135
Speaker 2:  I have to do is compete with Google on user experience, right there, there

371
00:23:13,135 --> 00:23:16,775
Speaker 2:  is an assumption of like common infrastructure that whatever I search for,

372
00:23:16,805 --> 00:23:20,375
Speaker 2:  it's going to be as good no matter where I search for it. Let people compete

373
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:23,725
Speaker 2:  on top of that. I actually think that could be super interesting. And suddenly

374
00:23:23,725 --> 00:23:25,885
Speaker 2:  you have a bunch of people with a bunch of different ideas about how search

375
00:23:25,885 --> 00:23:29,085
Speaker 2:  could work. AI becomes really interesting on all of that. And then it's like,

376
00:23:29,085 --> 00:23:32,765
Speaker 2:  okay, the, the foundation of how we search is common.

377
00:23:32,855 --> 00:23:36,765
Speaker 2:  Let's compete for real. I don't understand how you can do both of these things

378
00:23:36,765 --> 00:23:40,685
Speaker 2:  because it, it, each one makes the other one worse, right?

379
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:44,205
Speaker 2:  Like Google's white label search engine will be better if Google

380
00:23:44,205 --> 00:23:47,270
Speaker 2:  controls Android and Chrome because it will get that data that it is then

381
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,885
Speaker 2:  forced to share with everybody else. Wait,

382
00:23:48,925 --> 00:23:52,885
Speaker 4:  I feel like I'm like required si to point out

383
00:23:52,885 --> 00:23:55,605
Speaker 4:  that every time you make this claim, like some Google PR person leaps out

384
00:23:55,605 --> 00:23:58,285
Speaker 4:  of a bush and is like, we don't use chrome click data to inform search and

385
00:23:58,285 --> 00:23:59,645
Speaker 4:  that is what they say every time. Yeah.

386
00:23:59,645 --> 00:24:02,205
Speaker 2:  And that continues to be provably not true. I'm

387
00:24:02,205 --> 00:24:06,085
Speaker 4:  Just say Sure. Like I said, I feel required to say this and there's, I

388
00:24:06,085 --> 00:24:07,805
Speaker 4:  don't, I don't know if I believe it for one second.

389
00:24:07,885 --> 00:24:11,525
Speaker 2:  I trust things that come up in court and in discovery more than in the PR

390
00:24:11,525 --> 00:24:12,845
Speaker 2:  emails in my inbox. I'm

391
00:24:12,845 --> 00:24:14,845
Speaker 4:  Sorry, I saw all people, like right now outside of David's house, there's

392
00:24:14,845 --> 00:24:18,445
Speaker 4:  like a Google PR person peering through the bushes,

393
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:22,885
Speaker 2:  But like if the goal was to build the best search infrastructure

394
00:24:23,225 --> 00:24:26,925
Speaker 2:  for the whole internet, you do that, right? And like, that's how you get

395
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:29,885
Speaker 2:  the user data. It's how you get the query data like on and on and on. These

396
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:33,125
Speaker 2:  things can actually reinforce each other in a way that would make the one

397
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:36,045
Speaker 2:  product better if they were together and then you're giving that product

398
00:24:36,045 --> 00:24:36,645
Speaker 2:  to everybody else.

399
00:24:37,815 --> 00:24:38,105
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

400
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,545
Speaker 2:  I can see a world in which that makes sense, but instead you're saying we're

401
00:24:40,705 --> 00:24:43,545
Speaker 2:  gonna make Google search engine worse and also take away its engine to make

402
00:24:43,545 --> 00:24:46,105
Speaker 2:  it better and then force Google to give its worst search engine to everybody.

403
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:49,025
Speaker 2:  It's like, what are we, what are we actually, we're just making the whole

404
00:24:49,025 --> 00:24:50,105
Speaker 2:  search market worse.

405
00:24:50,165 --> 00:24:53,865
Speaker 4:  And I always thought that the whole point of this at the end of the day was

406
00:24:54,165 --> 00:24:57,465
Speaker 4:  who can build anything to compete with Google? And there's only one answer,

407
00:24:57,465 --> 00:25:01,265
Speaker 4:  which is Apple and Google has been spending billions of dollars

408
00:25:01,465 --> 00:25:05,425
Speaker 4:  a year to make sure that doesn't happen. And really the the outcome

409
00:25:05,445 --> 00:25:09,145
Speaker 4:  you want is Apple builds a search engine because it has

410
00:25:09,205 --> 00:25:12,945
Speaker 4:  enough incoming click data and query data from Safari on the

411
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:16,425
Speaker 4:  iPhone. It has the compute capability,

412
00:25:17,405 --> 00:25:20,585
Speaker 4:  it has the money that like just a free, you know, what they should have done

413
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:24,465
Speaker 4:  instead of chasing a car is they should have built a search engine and they

414
00:25:24,465 --> 00:25:27,545
Speaker 4:  didn't 'cause Google just paid them money to waste on a car. Like that's

415
00:25:27,545 --> 00:25:31,505
Speaker 4:  a weird economic outcome, but this doesn't seem like it

416
00:25:31,505 --> 00:25:34,785
Speaker 4:  creates that outcome at all, right? You're, you're gonna prevent Google from

417
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:37,825
Speaker 4:  paying Apple and then you're gonna spin off Chrome,

418
00:25:38,655 --> 00:25:42,305
Speaker 4:  then you're gonna say everybody can just use the Google utility

419
00:25:42,305 --> 00:25:45,625
Speaker 4:  version of search, which Apple will just use at marginal cost.

420
00:25:46,285 --> 00:25:49,425
Speaker 4:  And it's like, well we didn't, we didn't build the, we didn't make anybody

421
00:25:49,425 --> 00:25:52,905
Speaker 4:  build a new search engine. Maybe you're just bet on ai. Like are you, is

422
00:25:52,905 --> 00:25:55,665
Speaker 4:  this all just that's coming and it's gonna change everything?

423
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:59,865
Speaker 5:  I think the licensing actually does get you closer to that

424
00:25:59,865 --> 00:26:03,745
Speaker 5:  because you know, if Apple and If, you know, really any other

425
00:26:03,745 --> 00:26:07,705
Speaker 5:  search engine that wants to is licensing the Google search results

426
00:26:07,705 --> 00:26:11,225
Speaker 5:  and click and query data, they really have a jumpstart on

427
00:26:12,065 --> 00:26:16,025
Speaker 5:  creating a very quality search engine. And you know, if

428
00:26:16,025 --> 00:26:19,465
Speaker 5:  Apple combines that with its own data and own

429
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:23,625
Speaker 5:  engineering of product, you know, I think they then you're much closer

430
00:26:23,845 --> 00:26:27,545
Speaker 5:  to a very good product from Apple and they're not, they're no longer

431
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:31,505
Speaker 5:  constrained by, you know, if the judge decides to grant

432
00:26:31,765 --> 00:26:35,465
Speaker 5:  the, the contract remedies here, they're no longer constrained

433
00:26:35,645 --> 00:26:37,185
Speaker 5:  by their contract with Google.

434
00:26:37,695 --> 00:26:40,985
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I mean if this goes a certain way, you basically get to the point where

435
00:26:41,065 --> 00:26:44,885
Speaker 2:  I, as a developer, all I have to do is write a pretty front

436
00:26:44,905 --> 00:26:48,205
Speaker 2:  end and do like three API calls and I have a Google level

437
00:26:48,475 --> 00:26:52,405
Speaker 2:  quality search engine. Like yeah, that's pretty

438
00:26:52,455 --> 00:26:55,965
Speaker 2:  compelling. All of a sudden duck do go can re reliably say

439
00:26:56,175 --> 00:26:59,565
Speaker 2:  we're doing the privacy thing correctly. And also our results are exactly

440
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:03,565
Speaker 2:  as good, if not exactly the same as what you get from Google. And

441
00:27:03,565 --> 00:27:07,125
Speaker 2:  other people can compete on the AI stuff, you can compete on interface like

442
00:27:07,175 --> 00:27:10,925
Speaker 2:  Right. The the moves become really different because what you're saying is

443
00:27:10,945 --> 00:27:11,165
Speaker 2:  not,

444
00:27:12,825 --> 00:27:16,245
Speaker 2:  we can't compete with Google in order to have results quality

445
00:27:16,705 --> 00:27:20,525
Speaker 2:  and because that is a flywheel that we have no access to. I mean this is,

446
00:27:20,565 --> 00:27:23,685
Speaker 2:  I just keep coming back to Satya Nadella, the Microsoft CEO sitting in the

447
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:27,645
Speaker 2:  courtroom basically explaining why Bing is worse than Google and why it's

448
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:31,085
Speaker 2:  completely insurmountable. And everything in this filing makes me think that

449
00:27:31,085 --> 00:27:34,925
Speaker 2:  that is sitting in the heads of both Judge Meta and the DOJ

450
00:27:34,925 --> 00:27:37,445
Speaker 2:  in particular and they're like, what we are going to do is just give that

451
00:27:37,445 --> 00:27:40,925
Speaker 2:  flywheel to anyone who wants it. Exactly. And like, and just there it'll

452
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:44,775
Speaker 2:  be, and if that works, you'd get

453
00:27:44,855 --> 00:27:48,735
Speaker 2:  a million interesting search engines really fast. I think it would

454
00:27:49,015 --> 00:27:49,855
Speaker 2:  decimate Google,

455
00:27:50,555 --> 00:27:53,215
Speaker 4:  The Google comms person outside your house table right now. I can see them

456
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:56,495
Speaker 4:  in the window back there. They're holding up a sign that said, or Microsoft

457
00:27:56,495 --> 00:27:57,815
Speaker 4:  could have made Windows good.

458
00:27:58,965 --> 00:28:01,135
Speaker 2:  There's also that there is also that,

459
00:28:02,435 --> 00:28:06,135
Speaker 4:  And these arguments are hard. Like I they're they're, they are hard and,

460
00:28:06,135 --> 00:28:09,935
Speaker 4:  and Microsoft has mostly failed at, at competing with Google

461
00:28:10,435 --> 00:28:13,895
Speaker 4:  on search. And even Microsoft's AI work

462
00:28:14,555 --> 00:28:18,415
Speaker 4:  has not really meaningfully move the needle. So I do see the argument

463
00:28:18,415 --> 00:28:21,335
Speaker 4:  that you have, you gotta break this wide open, otherwise you're gonna end

464
00:28:21,335 --> 00:28:25,215
Speaker 4:  up in the same kind of Apple Google duopoly that kind of

465
00:28:25,215 --> 00:28:28,935
Speaker 4:  defined the last era of computing into whatever this next era is. Yeah.

466
00:28:29,035 --> 00:28:31,815
Speaker 4:  The other argument is that AI comes to nothing and this is all garbage

467
00:28:32,235 --> 00:28:35,455
Speaker 2:  And that Google is better at this because it's better at this, not because

468
00:28:35,525 --> 00:28:37,615
Speaker 2:  it's somehow structurally impossible to compute.

469
00:28:38,065 --> 00:28:42,015
Speaker 5:  Right. I think, I mean two things. One is that I think it would result in

470
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:45,895
Speaker 5:  a world where you're competing more on the product and the wrapping

471
00:28:45,895 --> 00:28:49,775
Speaker 5:  and the extra bells and whistles around search if everyone

472
00:28:49,775 --> 00:28:53,735
Speaker 5:  has access to the same kind of underlying data. And the second

473
00:28:53,735 --> 00:28:57,215
Speaker 5:  thing is that, you know, most of these remedies, the behavioral

474
00:28:57,375 --> 00:29:00,375
Speaker 5:  remedies, the things about licensing and that kind of thing

475
00:29:01,265 --> 00:29:05,135
Speaker 5:  would be enforced for 10 years. So it's not forever, but it's long enough

476
00:29:05,135 --> 00:29:08,895
Speaker 5:  that the DOJ feels that, you know, it would be able to

477
00:29:08,895 --> 00:29:11,495
Speaker 5:  create some sort of dynamic shift in the market. Yeah.

478
00:29:11,675 --> 00:29:15,415
Speaker 2:  See I look at 10 years and I'm like, 10 years is an eternity. Yeah. Like

479
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:19,415
Speaker 2:  10 years is, is and there, what was it after five years if

480
00:29:19,495 --> 00:29:23,135
Speaker 2:  Google's market share was less than 50% of search, they could

481
00:29:23,335 --> 00:29:25,775
Speaker 2:  petition to have this stuff called like that. That's what we're asking for

482
00:29:25,775 --> 00:29:29,655
Speaker 2:  here, right? Like Google, which has been somewhere between like 85 and

483
00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:33,455
Speaker 2:  95% of search for forever. They're like, no, no, no,

484
00:29:33,595 --> 00:29:37,135
Speaker 2:  we would like you to be less than 50 and we will consider this to be a competitive

485
00:29:37,135 --> 00:29:37,615
Speaker 2:  market. Again,

486
00:29:37,715 --> 00:29:41,605
Speaker 4:  So I wanna talk about the politics of that timeline specifically But first,

487
00:29:41,725 --> 00:29:44,845
Speaker 4:  I just wanna play a quick game. It's called who Can Buy Chrome?

488
00:29:46,955 --> 00:29:49,085
Speaker 4:  Does anyone Apple, would anyone like to buzz in

489
00:29:49,265 --> 00:29:50,485
Speaker 2:  Amazon? Amazon

490
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:54,845
Speaker 4:  Meta, Amazon's. But wouldn't the d oj not like it if Amazon

491
00:29:54,905 --> 00:29:58,445
Speaker 4:  or Meta or Microsoft or Apple bought Chrome? Like didn't we just

492
00:29:58,765 --> 00:29:59,765
Speaker 4:  recreate the problem?

493
00:30:01,035 --> 00:30:04,805
Speaker 5:  Yeah, yeah. I mean I think it's possible that they say, you know what,

494
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:08,765
Speaker 5:  these are, you know, different business lines and it's not and it is

495
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,685
Speaker 4:  Not competitive. Wait, don't think Amazon Silk browser is a competitor to

496
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:11,885
Speaker 4:  grow?

497
00:30:12,755 --> 00:30:15,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean that's the problem they're gonna run into here. And I think

498
00:30:15,675 --> 00:30:19,525
Speaker 5:  that that, that is an issue for that remedy. And I think on top of that

499
00:30:19,555 --> 00:30:23,365
Speaker 5:  it's like, okay, well what if this other theoretical big tech company that

500
00:30:23,475 --> 00:30:27,005
Speaker 5:  buys Chrome then decides that they wanna make a search engine? And then are

501
00:30:27,005 --> 00:30:30,085
Speaker 5:  we back in the same place, just like under a different company name?

502
00:30:30,755 --> 00:30:34,165
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I mean the number being thrown around is what, $20 billion? Yeah. The

503
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,885
Speaker 2:  number of companies that could spend that on a web browser with,

504
00:30:37,885 --> 00:30:41,765
Speaker 2:  like you said earlier, NELI no inherent business model. Like it's, it's so

505
00:30:41,765 --> 00:30:45,485
Speaker 2:  important to, to underline the fact that a web browser on its own

506
00:30:45,825 --> 00:30:49,285
Speaker 2:  is not a business. Yeah. There is just no evidence that you can build a web

507
00:30:49,285 --> 00:30:51,285
Speaker 2:  browser that will be a business at any scale

508
00:30:51,705 --> 00:30:55,325
Speaker 4:  For Josh from from Arc on the browser company and a coder and

509
00:30:55,555 --> 00:30:58,005
Speaker 4:  they just pivoted away from making a web browser. It's very

510
00:30:58,005 --> 00:31:00,965
Speaker 2:  Obvious. You just, you just can't do it. You certainly can't do it to make

511
00:31:01,005 --> 00:31:03,605
Speaker 2:  a $20 billion acquisition make any sense. By

512
00:31:03,605 --> 00:31:06,965
Speaker 4:  The way, $20 billion is low. That's the number that Google is paying Apple

513
00:31:06,995 --> 00:31:09,605
Speaker 4:  just to be the default in search. That's the yearly number.

514
00:31:09,795 --> 00:31:13,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I saw somebody say, just take over Chrome, get the same deals because

515
00:31:13,445 --> 00:31:17,085
Speaker 2:  you'll be allowed to and it's the greatest private equity arbitrage

516
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:18,085
Speaker 2:  opportunity in history.

517
00:31:18,385 --> 00:31:21,285
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah, this is, you should buy Chick-fil-A and open it on Sundays. Like

518
00:31:21,285 --> 00:31:22,445
Speaker 4:  you don't have to do anything.

519
00:31:24,955 --> 00:31:28,525
Speaker 4:  It's very easy. Yeah, but I but Google won't be allowed to make those deals,

520
00:31:28,705 --> 00:31:32,565
Speaker 4:  so you're already, you're just like operating very much behind.

521
00:31:32,695 --> 00:31:36,605
Speaker 4:  Right? I, I think Chrome, the more we talk about it just even in

522
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:39,765
Speaker 4:  the past half an hour here, it feels like Chrome is a side show. We're going

523
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:42,725
Speaker 4:  to train all of our attention and argue about whether, whether or not you

524
00:31:42,725 --> 00:31:46,325
Speaker 4:  can, you should sell Chrome or who you can sell it to and the DOJ will take

525
00:31:46,435 --> 00:31:50,405
Speaker 4:  will give it up so that Google can't make these deals and

526
00:31:50,405 --> 00:31:53,245
Speaker 4:  that Google has to be this like weird kind of utility that anybody can do.

527
00:31:53,275 --> 00:31:56,845
Speaker 4:  Like, that feels like part of the negotiation here. Maybe I'm wrong. I have,

528
00:31:56,965 --> 00:32:00,565
Speaker 4:  I have no insight. It's just as we talk about it, yeah, it just seems so

529
00:32:01,665 --> 00:32:05,245
Speaker 4:  it, it feels like it accomplishes so little in the end versus

530
00:32:05,765 --> 00:32:06,885
Speaker 4:  actually opening up the search engine.

531
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:11,485
Speaker 5:  I think this is a weird case where, you know, generally structural remedies

532
00:32:11,545 --> 00:32:15,365
Speaker 5:  or breakups are thought to be like cleaner and easier and you know, the

533
00:32:15,365 --> 00:32:18,765
Speaker 5:  court can just say, all right, let's like s this and then we're done. We

534
00:32:18,765 --> 00:32:22,685
Speaker 5:  can wipe our hands of it. But it's complicated in this case because

535
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:26,365
Speaker 5:  who's gonna buy Chrome and you know, how does that look? You know,

536
00:32:26,715 --> 00:32:30,485
Speaker 5:  there's a lot of questions there. Whereas the behavioral

537
00:32:30,565 --> 00:32:34,245
Speaker 5:  remedies are often thought of as, alright, this requires more

538
00:32:34,835 --> 00:32:38,405
Speaker 5:  oversight by the court. This is like a little bit harder to execute.

539
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:43,285
Speaker 5:  But in this case it does seem to get at the heart of what the DOJ had

540
00:32:43,345 --> 00:32:47,005
Speaker 5:  argued in the case was the problem and was the reason that other search

541
00:32:47,005 --> 00:32:50,525
Speaker 5:  engines couldn't catch up. And So I think we might,

542
00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:54,685
Speaker 5:  I could see the logic of, you know, why they might tend toward a more

543
00:32:54,685 --> 00:32:56,285
Speaker 5:  behavioral remedy here. Yeah,

544
00:32:56,285 --> 00:33:00,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I mean it it it's like negotiation 1 0 1, right? To go in with something

545
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:03,405
Speaker 2:  like this that you're, you know, you're willing to give up Yeah.

546
00:33:03,405 --> 00:33:07,285
Speaker 4:  Soon after shot and it is, you'll be the CEO of just Google

547
00:33:07,745 --> 00:33:11,645
Speaker 4:  duo, right? Like yeah Zach, you gotta have, what do you

548
00:33:11,645 --> 00:33:13,165
Speaker 4:  wanna give me in return? Right? Yeah.

549
00:33:13,165 --> 00:33:16,565
Speaker 2:  You gotta have the one thing that you're willing to part with just in the

550
00:33:16,565 --> 00:33:17,885
Speaker 2:  name of seeming like you're arguing

551
00:33:17,985 --> 00:33:21,205
Speaker 4:  In Good. I would be good see of Google Docs just sell, give me Google. I

552
00:33:21,205 --> 00:33:23,165
Speaker 4:  have a number of ideas already from the jump.

553
00:33:23,275 --> 00:33:26,085
Speaker 2:  They already did taps. Google Docs is perfect. Don't touch Google Docs.

554
00:33:26,765 --> 00:33:30,205
Speaker 5:  I wonder if they would make it so that they do something similar like they're

555
00:33:30,205 --> 00:33:32,645
Speaker 5:  proposing with Android where it's like, all right, fine, we don't have to

556
00:33:32,955 --> 00:33:36,285
Speaker 5:  spin out Chrome, but you know, we will hang it over your head

557
00:33:36,745 --> 00:33:38,485
Speaker 5:  in case you don't comply with everything else. Yeah.

558
00:33:38,485 --> 00:33:41,485
Speaker 4:  That's what I feel like you have to sell. Chrome is such a big

559
00:33:42,175 --> 00:33:45,805
Speaker 4:  shiny distraction from all of this other stuff, right?

560
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:49,645
Speaker 4:  The marginal cost access to the Google search index is also a dagger to that

561
00:33:49,645 --> 00:33:50,965
Speaker 4:  company's business. Yeah.

562
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:54,925
Speaker 2:  But those are the things like, like you're saying, Lauren, that actually

563
00:33:54,945 --> 00:33:58,685
Speaker 2:  get to the trial that we had last year, right? Like yes,

564
00:33:58,865 --> 00:34:02,325
Speaker 2:  the Chrome thing I think came out of left field for a lot of people because

565
00:34:02,345 --> 00:34:06,285
Speaker 2:  it, it just doesn't address the stuff that they spent months in court arguing

566
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:10,245
Speaker 2:  about it is it, you can sort of get there from Chrome,

567
00:34:11,105 --> 00:34:14,685
Speaker 2:  but all of these arguments were about like the, the structural system

568
00:34:15,195 --> 00:34:18,965
Speaker 2:  that makes the underlying infrastructure of Google

569
00:34:19,185 --> 00:34:23,085
Speaker 2:  search unstoppable and, and all, all the rest of the stuff

570
00:34:23,085 --> 00:34:26,485
Speaker 2:  in the filing is like poking at how it appeal that apart and then there's

571
00:34:26,485 --> 00:34:27,485
Speaker 2:  Chrome. Yeah.

572
00:34:27,485 --> 00:34:31,365
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I I think, I mean another aspect of the trial was like where

573
00:34:31,425 --> 00:34:35,405
Speaker 5:  are you able to access search and Chrome and web browsers generally

574
00:34:35,545 --> 00:34:39,245
Speaker 5:  are one of the big access points. You either access search

575
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:42,285
Speaker 5:  through your browser or your phone basically. So

576
00:34:43,765 --> 00:34:47,245
Speaker 5:  I, I think the thing with Chrome is that it's the one like

577
00:34:47,465 --> 00:34:51,445
Speaker 5:  entity and Android, they're the one entity that Google actually owns.

578
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:55,325
Speaker 5:  Like the court can't impose a, a remedy on another company.

579
00:34:55,505 --> 00:34:58,445
Speaker 5:  It can't impose a remedy on Apple or or Samsung. But I can,

580
00:35:00,345 --> 00:35:00,965
Speaker 4:  That's not true,

581
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:04,405
Speaker 4:  but

582
00:35:04,505 --> 00:35:08,405
Speaker 5:  It can impose a remedy on Google to say, alright, at least for this

583
00:35:08,505 --> 00:35:12,205
Speaker 5:  one browser that you own, you can't use it in a self

584
00:35:12,445 --> 00:35:12,965
Speaker 5:  referencing way.

585
00:35:13,515 --> 00:35:16,645
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So I do wanna talk about the, the politics of this. I think it's a

586
00:35:16,645 --> 00:35:20,565
Speaker 4:  good segue. So we've been comparing this case and the Apple case to the Microsoft

587
00:35:20,565 --> 00:35:24,285
Speaker 4:  case in the nineties for some time since they started basically, and it

588
00:35:24,635 --> 00:35:28,405
Speaker 4:  strikes me even the timeline here and the

589
00:35:28,405 --> 00:35:31,965
Speaker 4:  politics of the timeline are the same. So Microsoft case in the nineties

590
00:35:31,965 --> 00:35:33,485
Speaker 4:  started 1998 under Bill Clinton,

591
00:35:35,005 --> 00:35:38,865
Speaker 4:  the DOJ won, they pursued a breakup. George Bush gets

592
00:35:38,865 --> 00:35:42,345
Speaker 4:  elected and the DOJ says, ah, nevermind we're gonna settle a case. And there's

593
00:35:42,345 --> 00:35:46,065
Speaker 4:  some like winding back and forth in there, but there was a moment when Microsoft

594
00:35:46,085 --> 00:35:49,665
Speaker 4:  was gonna get broken up and then there was a moment when the DOJ said, nah,

595
00:35:50,395 --> 00:35:52,745
Speaker 4:  we're done with that. We're gonna do these big consent decrees and you're

596
00:35:52,745 --> 00:35:56,625
Speaker 4:  fine. And all that was chaos, right? And the executives at Microsoft who

597
00:35:56,625 --> 00:36:00,465
Speaker 4:  were there at that time will tell you it was super distracting and you know,

598
00:36:00,465 --> 00:36:02,905
Speaker 4:  bill Gates is like, this is why I didn't invent the cell phone, which is

599
00:36:03,525 --> 00:36:07,385
Speaker 4:  you just tell yourself that Bill, right? Like you did the Zoom,

600
00:36:08,445 --> 00:36:11,785
Speaker 4:  I'm sorry. But that, that distraction from the giant

601
00:36:12,175 --> 00:36:16,025
Speaker 4:  created the opportunity for Google to exist in many ways. It

602
00:36:16,025 --> 00:36:19,825
Speaker 4:  created the opportunity for Apple to make its big comeback because

603
00:36:20,535 --> 00:36:23,825
Speaker 4:  it's not like Mac OS nine software was selling the iMac,

604
00:36:24,365 --> 00:36:28,345
Speaker 4:  web browsers were selling the iMac. So all of this distraction

605
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:31,425
Speaker 4:  about Microsoft and bundling in Air Explorer and all this stuff in the nineties,

606
00:36:31,575 --> 00:36:34,865
Speaker 4:  whether it came to anything, it just created the opportunity for other players

607
00:36:34,925 --> 00:36:38,865
Speaker 4:  to enter. 'cause Microsoft was constrained by whatever. Here we have a

608
00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:42,505
Speaker 4:  very similar situation. This case actually started in the Trump administration.

609
00:36:43,565 --> 00:36:47,505
Speaker 4:  It got won in the Biden administration under this DOJ. Now we're gonna head

610
00:36:47,535 --> 00:36:51,505
Speaker 4:  into a remedies phase with a new president,

611
00:36:52,305 --> 00:36:55,465
Speaker 4:  a much more transactional president who will pay direct attention to the

612
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:58,345
Speaker 4:  CEO EO of this company who has already said, he's talking to the CEO EO of

613
00:36:58,345 --> 00:37:01,385
Speaker 4:  this company with Elon Musk on the call that was reported this week. And

614
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:04,425
Speaker 4:  who knows who the Attorney general will be. Let's just start with the basics

615
00:37:04,525 --> 00:37:07,985
Speaker 4:  is, is Jonathan Kanter still gonna be the assistant attorney general of

616
00:37:07,985 --> 00:37:10,065
Speaker 4:  antitrust when this case goes to the remedies phase?

617
00:37:10,535 --> 00:37:13,905
Speaker 5:  That would seem highly unlikely. You know, even when

618
00:37:14,425 --> 00:37:18,385
Speaker 5:  I, I think administrations are aligned on certain policies, you know, they

619
00:37:18,385 --> 00:37:21,745
Speaker 5:  often just wanna bring in their own people. So I think, you know, we're likely

620
00:37:21,845 --> 00:37:25,705
Speaker 5:  to see a different antitrust chief and at the DOJ under Trump.

621
00:37:26,685 --> 00:37:30,505
Speaker 5:  But I think it is a big open question of what

622
00:37:30,605 --> 00:37:34,585
Speaker 5:  way that person will lean. Are they gonna be a more populous

623
00:37:34,805 --> 00:37:38,025
Speaker 5:  neo Brandeis antitrust person who

624
00:37:39,225 --> 00:37:42,265
Speaker 5:  actually does want to pursue really strong remedies against Google? Or are

625
00:37:42,265 --> 00:37:46,145
Speaker 5:  they gonna be more of the, you know, conserv establishment

626
00:37:46,145 --> 00:37:49,985
Speaker 5:  conservative type that wants to

627
00:37:50,815 --> 00:37:54,225
Speaker 5:  kind of do as light a touch a thing as they can So

628
00:37:54,785 --> 00:37:58,545
Speaker 5:  I think. We still don't really know what that's going to be. I mean, we don't

629
00:37:58,545 --> 00:38:02,185
Speaker 5:  even know who the ag nominee is gonna be after Matt Gates dropped out.

630
00:38:02,325 --> 00:38:06,185
Speaker 5:  So I think there are a lot of big questions about that,

631
00:38:06,365 --> 00:38:10,185
Speaker 5:  but I, I do think it's important that it was brought under the first Trump

632
00:38:10,185 --> 00:38:13,825
Speaker 5:  administration, So I. Don't think we're gonna see it completely wither away,

633
00:38:14,645 --> 00:38:18,105
Speaker 5:  but I could see for sure that maybe the next DOJ

634
00:38:18,215 --> 00:38:21,545
Speaker 5:  doesn't wanna go as far as this DOJ has put out there.

635
00:38:22,045 --> 00:38:25,425
Speaker 4:  Do you think there's any gamesmanship here, which is actually what we should

636
00:38:25,425 --> 00:38:28,905
Speaker 4:  sell Google into as many component parts as we think that's our proposal

637
00:38:29,325 --> 00:38:33,025
Speaker 4:  so that the next DOJ shows up and even the walk like

638
00:38:33,025 --> 00:38:34,945
Speaker 4:  pre-negotiated against the next administration

639
00:38:35,835 --> 00:38:39,605
Speaker 5:  Perhaps. I mean, I think any, any administration that

640
00:38:39,655 --> 00:38:43,605
Speaker 5:  walks back some of these, they're going to have to deal with what that

641
00:38:43,605 --> 00:38:46,245
Speaker 5:  looks like to the public. You know, they, I'm sure they would say that's

642
00:38:46,245 --> 00:38:50,165
Speaker 5:  not really a factor for them, but I think for any, anyone who

643
00:38:50,165 --> 00:38:53,885
Speaker 5:  works in politics, it is to an extent they're gonna have to say,

644
00:38:53,885 --> 00:38:57,605
Speaker 5:  alright, well we did pull our punches here and explain

645
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:01,605
Speaker 5:  that So I think it, you know, it's harder to take

646
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:05,245
Speaker 5:  something away than to add something back in and

647
00:39:05,465 --> 00:39:08,765
Speaker 5:  you know, I could see that potentially being a consideration here. The

648
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:11,205
Speaker 4:  Other piece, and I'm I'm just curious here to read on this, we obviously

649
00:39:11,205 --> 00:39:14,925
Speaker 4:  don't know who the attorney general will be and

650
00:39:14,995 --> 00:39:18,125
Speaker 4:  Matt Gates had so many problems that he just withdrew. Like he literally

651
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:21,325
Speaker 4:  went to Capitol Hill for 20 minutes. He met with senators and was like, I'm

652
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:25,245
Speaker 4:  out you guys like, and so that, that is whatever it is.

653
00:39:25,945 --> 00:39:28,325
Speaker 4:  And that's not the kind of politics we ever really talk on the show, but

654
00:39:28,865 --> 00:39:32,765
Speaker 4:  he was kind of an antitrust guy. Like he was into it maybe

655
00:39:32,875 --> 00:39:36,765
Speaker 4:  Yeah, in a bad faith way. Like I just wanna punish big companies, which is

656
00:39:36,765 --> 00:39:40,725
Speaker 4:  seems to animate a lot of Trumpist antitrust, but he was still

657
00:39:40,725 --> 00:39:44,685
Speaker 4:  like, that's pretty cool. JD Vance, we've watched video of

658
00:39:44,685 --> 00:39:47,245
Speaker 4:  him saying Google is a problem and Lena Khan is doing a good job.

659
00:39:48,665 --> 00:39:52,565
Speaker 4:  We Josh Hawley, right? Like there there is a strain of

660
00:39:52,755 --> 00:39:56,725
Speaker 4:  antitrust thinking in the modern Republican party

661
00:39:56,915 --> 00:40:00,245
Speaker 4:  that says, yeah, we probably should break up Google, Elon Musk.

662
00:40:01,005 --> 00:40:04,965
Speaker 4:  I mean he says everything you can, you can find a tweet of anything

663
00:40:04,965 --> 00:40:08,565
Speaker 4:  at this point. But he is, he's said Google is a problem. Mark Andreessen

664
00:40:08,565 --> 00:40:11,685
Speaker 4:  and Ben Horowitz benefactor is the Trump campaign and now benefactors the

665
00:40:11,685 --> 00:40:15,365
Speaker 4:  administration, they, they think Google is a problem, like openly. They've

666
00:40:15,365 --> 00:40:19,285
Speaker 4:  openly said it. What, how does that tie up

667
00:40:19,285 --> 00:40:23,005
Speaker 4:  with actually want The government out of messing with big American companies

668
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:26,845
Speaker 4:  because it, there's, there's a ideological inconsistency there and

669
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,125
Speaker 4:  I have no idea how that resolves.

670
00:40:28,835 --> 00:40:32,805
Speaker 5:  Well I think the staying out of American companies comes more from the

671
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:36,685
Speaker 5:  establishment arm of the Republican party and I think Trump, you know,

672
00:40:37,045 --> 00:40:40,765
Speaker 5:  I I think he can kind of talk that part of it

673
00:40:40,795 --> 00:40:44,485
Speaker 5:  when it, it is beneficial to him or you know, in

674
00:40:44,645 --> 00:40:47,725
Speaker 5:  areas that make sense for him. But I think, you know, when it comes to big

675
00:40:47,725 --> 00:40:51,565
Speaker 5:  tech, he has often wanted to speak out on them and

676
00:40:52,585 --> 00:40:56,485
Speaker 5:  you know, has an elevated antitrust

677
00:40:56,485 --> 00:41:00,165
Speaker 5:  enforcers in his previous administration who did go after both Google

678
00:41:00,265 --> 00:41:03,765
Speaker 5:  and Meta So I think there's always been that strain within

679
00:41:04,055 --> 00:41:08,005
Speaker 5:  Trump and, you know, Trump's previous administration, So I think,

680
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:11,645
Speaker 5:  you know, it is definitely notable that he continues to surround himself

681
00:41:11,675 --> 00:41:15,565
Speaker 5:  with people who do believe in this kind of

682
00:41:15,565 --> 00:41:19,445
Speaker 5:  more progressive view of antitrust. But at the same time, I would caveat

683
00:41:19,515 --> 00:41:23,445
Speaker 5:  that like with Trump, we never really know, you know,

684
00:41:23,445 --> 00:41:27,085
Speaker 5:  what's going to happen? You know, is he gonna change his mind the next day

685
00:41:27,145 --> 00:41:30,845
Speaker 5:  and who's really got his ear So I think it's hard to

686
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:34,605
Speaker 5:  pull any policy from any one of those people.

687
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:38,725
Speaker 5:  But I think just seeing that there are so many of them that

688
00:41:38,725 --> 00:41:42,125
Speaker 5:  he's surrounding himself by and you know, the

689
00:41:42,405 --> 00:41:46,205
Speaker 5:  animosity that he has had towards certain tech companies and tech executives,

690
00:41:46,485 --> 00:41:50,165
Speaker 5:  I think it's not hard to imagine that there would be some incentive to

691
00:41:50,885 --> 00:41:52,965
Speaker 5:  continue these fights against the tech companies.

692
00:41:53,405 --> 00:41:57,165
Speaker 2:  I would also just point out that the, the, the unifying theme of a lot of

693
00:41:57,165 --> 00:42:01,125
Speaker 2:  these antitrust fights is against companies that have they, they

694
00:42:01,125 --> 00:42:04,725
Speaker 2:  have decided have wronged them in some way on the internet. Like I think

695
00:42:04,725 --> 00:42:08,525
Speaker 2:  it's less about like a broad moral belief about antitrust and

696
00:42:08,525 --> 00:42:12,405
Speaker 2:  more about big companies that say bad things about me

697
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:13,045
Speaker 2:  in search results.

698
00:42:13,275 --> 00:42:16,445
Speaker 4:  Yeah, there's no, I I wanna be very clear, there's no rationalizing these

699
00:42:16,605 --> 00:42:17,085
Speaker 2:  Decisions. No,

700
00:42:17,345 --> 00:42:20,325
Speaker 4:  I'm just pointing out it's a bunch of people who are mad. Yes. And they act

701
00:42:20,325 --> 00:42:24,085
Speaker 4:  in ways that accomplish retribution. And Trump in

702
00:42:24,085 --> 00:42:27,165
Speaker 4:  particular has said they gotta treat me better, I will break them up like

703
00:42:27,165 --> 00:42:27,445
Speaker 4:  right

704
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:30,325
Speaker 2:  And right or wrong, like however you wanna feel about it. They have been

705
00:42:30,505 --> 00:42:34,365
Speaker 2:  mad at Google in particular long enough that I think it stands

706
00:42:34,365 --> 00:42:36,445
Speaker 2:  to reason that they're going to continue to be mad at Google. Right.

707
00:42:36,445 --> 00:42:38,725
Speaker 4:  And Anderson Horowitz can probably find a way to buy Chrome,

708
00:42:39,705 --> 00:42:42,795
Speaker 2:  Elon Musk Yeah. Or fund a bunch of government that are gonna have a really

709
00:42:42,795 --> 00:42:45,955
Speaker 2:  easy time building ad funded search engines now, right. Like that suddenly,

710
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:50,155
Speaker 2:  suddenly you take the best market in the history of the internet and

711
00:42:50,155 --> 00:42:53,995
Speaker 2:  you break it into a thousand pieces and make it available for anyone to come

712
00:42:53,995 --> 00:42:57,755
Speaker 2:  into like that you've just made every VC's year, right?

713
00:42:57,755 --> 00:43:01,475
Speaker 2:  Like v they, we've heard this for years, it came up at the trial

714
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:05,515
Speaker 2:  that VCs won't fund search companies because it is, it's a, it's a dead area.

715
00:43:05,585 --> 00:43:08,795
Speaker 2:  It's not even worth trying to compete with Google. And instead what you're

716
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:12,235
Speaker 2:  doing is you're saying here's a hundred billion dollar a year industry that

717
00:43:12,235 --> 00:43:14,795
Speaker 2:  is suddenly completely up for grabs and you don't even have to try that hard

718
00:43:14,795 --> 00:43:18,635
Speaker 2:  to be competitive. Like Yeah, yeah. I'd be into that if I were a

719
00:43:18,635 --> 00:43:18,795
Speaker 2:  fe.

720
00:43:19,355 --> 00:43:23,235
Speaker 4:  I will point out that the first Trump administrations antitrust

721
00:43:23,235 --> 00:43:26,395
Speaker 4:  efforts ended with one

722
00:43:27,315 --> 00:43:30,555
Speaker 4:  T-Mobile buying sprint in a negotiated deal that created project channel

723
00:43:30,685 --> 00:43:33,155
Speaker 4:  fivey America's fourth wireless carrier,

724
00:43:34,395 --> 00:43:38,305
Speaker 4:  which to this day I think strikes terror in the heart of everyday Americans.

725
00:43:39,705 --> 00:43:42,985
Speaker 4:  I don't who the fuck knows what's going on over there. That's one. And then

726
00:43:42,985 --> 00:43:46,785
Speaker 4:  the other one they fought against at and t buying T

727
00:43:46,785 --> 00:43:49,505
Speaker 4:  Time Warner because Trump hated CNN so much.

728
00:43:50,645 --> 00:43:54,505
Speaker 4:  That's it. That was the entire intellectual justification for opposing that

729
00:43:54,505 --> 00:43:58,465
Speaker 4:  merger they lost, which is fine. And that resulted in a four three

730
00:43:58,655 --> 00:44:02,465
Speaker 4:  gray scale Justice League directed by Zack Snyder. Those are the two

731
00:44:02,665 --> 00:44:05,265
Speaker 4:  outcomes of the previous Trump administration's antitrust efforts.

732
00:44:05,565 --> 00:44:08,505
Speaker 2:  That's good. We've now hit the bingo card for the first cast talks about

733
00:44:08,535 --> 00:44:10,225
Speaker 2:  antitrust. So it's, I'm

734
00:44:10,225 --> 00:44:12,825
Speaker 4:  Just pointing out, you're like, how will Trump deal with Chrome? And you're

735
00:44:12,825 --> 00:44:16,185
Speaker 4:  like, well the evidence suggests they will force them to hire Zach Snyder

736
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:20,025
Speaker 4:  to make Grayscale Square YouTube videos and start Boost

737
00:44:20,145 --> 00:44:23,985
Speaker 4:  Mobile. Like I don't know what to make of all that, but you could

738
00:44:24,505 --> 00:44:26,665
Speaker 4:  actually outta the pieces of Google, you could probably do that. Google file

739
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:29,785
Speaker 4:  is now Boost mobile. Yeah, I was gonna say that's my, that's my prediction.

740
00:44:29,925 --> 00:44:33,805
Speaker 4:  The last thing I wanna ask you about Lauren, real quickly, this case, the

741
00:44:33,805 --> 00:44:37,205
Speaker 4:  Google case is done right? They were found guilty of having a monopoly and

742
00:44:37,205 --> 00:44:41,045
Speaker 4:  now we're in the remedies phase. The other case, it's wrapping up,

743
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:44,405
Speaker 4:  right? It's gonna come to a conclusion. The judge is gonna decide the judge,

744
00:44:44,905 --> 00:44:48,165
Speaker 4:  not a political actor in the way that some other folks are political actors

745
00:44:48,265 --> 00:44:50,925
Speaker 4:  or at least not supposed to be. That will come to a conclusion.

746
00:44:51,995 --> 00:44:55,725
Speaker 4:  Apple's case is still pending, right? It hasn't gone to trial,

747
00:44:55,785 --> 00:44:59,645
Speaker 4:  no one's been ruled anything. We're Apple asked for a dismissal today.

748
00:44:59,645 --> 00:45:03,485
Speaker 4:  They said make this go away. Apple has a lot to want

749
00:45:03,635 --> 00:45:07,165
Speaker 4:  from an incoming Trump administration just straightforwardly. Apple makes

750
00:45:07,245 --> 00:45:11,165
Speaker 4:  a lot of stuff in China and Trump wants to impose tariffs on goods made

751
00:45:11,165 --> 00:45:14,725
Speaker 4:  in China. So you can see Tim Cook has to horse trade his way out of that.

752
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:18,605
Speaker 4:  He did an excellent job of that last time. Like maybe Tim

753
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:22,525
Speaker 4:  Cook's singular achievement as CEO is navigating Donald Trump to

754
00:45:22,525 --> 00:45:26,045
Speaker 4:  excuse Apple products from tariffs. You can make the argument, I'm not saying

755
00:45:26,045 --> 00:45:29,565
Speaker 4:  it's good or bad, I'm not, not out outside of the morality of it. He did

756
00:45:29,605 --> 00:45:33,485
Speaker 4:  a good job of it. He, he excused Apple from a lot of noise by

757
00:45:33,885 --> 00:45:37,645
Speaker 4:  managing one man very directly. Do you think that he's gonna be able to

758
00:45:37,645 --> 00:45:41,525
Speaker 4:  manage his way outta this antitrust lawsuit because the incoming

759
00:45:41,845 --> 00:45:43,125
Speaker 4:  attorney general could just drop it?

760
00:45:43,505 --> 00:45:46,485
Speaker 5:  That's true. Yeah. I, I think, you know,

761
00:45:47,675 --> 00:45:50,765
Speaker 5:  when it's something like the, when it's coming from the DOJ, it really is

762
00:45:50,765 --> 00:45:54,525
Speaker 5:  up to the DOJ where they, if they want to continue the case and what direction

763
00:45:54,525 --> 00:45:58,405
Speaker 5:  they want it to go, you know, they certainly could

764
00:45:59,005 --> 00:46:02,365
Speaker 5:  withdraw it, but I think that's hard. It's already,

765
00:46:02,905 --> 00:46:05,965
Speaker 5:  you know, in this kind of pretrial phase,

766
00:46:06,755 --> 00:46:10,605
Speaker 5:  they were just arguing a motion to dismiss and you know, now that's gonna

767
00:46:10,605 --> 00:46:14,365
Speaker 5:  be up to the judge to decide whether any part of the case can move forward.

768
00:46:15,465 --> 00:46:18,725
Speaker 5:  And I guess it's theoretically possible that the judge dismisses the case.

769
00:46:18,965 --> 00:46:22,845
Speaker 5:  I think often in these really big cases we might see them

770
00:46:22,845 --> 00:46:26,725
Speaker 5:  narrowed but not fully dismissed. So yeah, then it's on the

771
00:46:26,765 --> 00:46:30,685
Speaker 5:  DOJ to decide what they do. And I

772
00:46:30,685 --> 00:46:30,845
Speaker 5:  think

773
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:36,165
Speaker 5:  Apple is in much more of a friendly position with

774
00:46:36,215 --> 00:46:40,205
Speaker 5:  Trump in a sense, just based on the past administration. When

775
00:46:40,225 --> 00:46:43,965
Speaker 5:  Tim Cook managed to really kind of walk this really precarious

776
00:46:44,035 --> 00:46:47,405
Speaker 5:  line in, you know, just being on

777
00:46:47,675 --> 00:46:51,645
Speaker 5:  Trump's good side, So, I think if any company could do it,

778
00:46:51,795 --> 00:46:55,445
Speaker 5:  perhaps it's Apple, but you know, that

779
00:46:55,455 --> 00:46:59,285
Speaker 5:  would obviously be a big deal if DOJ just dropped the

780
00:46:59,395 --> 00:47:02,365
Speaker 5:  case entirely. I think that would be somewhat unusual.

781
00:47:02,985 --> 00:47:06,805
Speaker 4:  And the DOJ is supposed to be independent of the presidency and I don't think

782
00:47:06,805 --> 00:47:09,525
Speaker 4:  Donald Trump wants a DOJ that's independent of his presidency. Right? Like,

783
00:47:10,405 --> 00:47:14,245
Speaker 4:  I don't wanna be, this is what we're talking about is corruption, like sort

784
00:47:14,245 --> 00:47:17,325
Speaker 4:  of straightforwardly corruption. Can Kim Cook call Donald Trump and say drop

785
00:47:17,325 --> 00:47:20,485
Speaker 4:  my antitrust case Like in a normal administration

786
00:47:21,035 --> 00:47:24,885
Speaker 4:  that would end there, like right lawyers would come screaming into the White

787
00:47:24,885 --> 00:47:28,005
Speaker 4:  House, they would burst into the Oval Office and be like, Mr. President,

788
00:47:28,005 --> 00:47:31,765
Speaker 4:  you can't do that and that is not gonna happen this time. Like Yeah, exactly.

789
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,405
Speaker 4:  Very clearly. He does not want that to happen. He does not want that constraint

790
00:47:34,405 --> 00:47:37,765
Speaker 4:  on his behavior. The question is what happens

791
00:47:38,115 --> 00:47:42,085
Speaker 4:  next? Right? And, and honestly, what's a sym hook trade away? Like do

792
00:47:42,085 --> 00:47:45,605
Speaker 4:  you care more about tariffs or do you care more about your antitrust lawsuit?

793
00:47:46,475 --> 00:47:50,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah, there's still a North Carolina factory that either does or

794
00:47:50,205 --> 00:47:54,085
Speaker 2:  doesn't exist and either will or won't exist that Tim can always throw into

795
00:47:54,085 --> 00:47:54,205
Speaker 2:  this

796
00:47:54,385 --> 00:47:54,805
Speaker 4:  Saying.

797
00:53:15,405 --> 00:53:18,765
Speaker 4:  Whenever I say his name, we sure can In our emails, I'll tell you that.

798
00:53:19,785 --> 00:53:22,645
Speaker 4:  No, we're gonna do gadgets. We, it's all the politics are out of our system.

799
00:53:22,645 --> 00:53:25,410
Speaker 4:  We're gonna do gadgets. Well, there's gonna be a little politics later, but

800
00:53:25,545 --> 00:53:26,845
Speaker 4:  for now, we're gonna do gadgets.

801
00:53:26,845 --> 00:53:28,525
Speaker 2:  Everything is politics. Eli,

802
00:53:29,635 --> 00:53:33,605
Speaker 4:  Just like Alexa calling an Uber. Only the Uber has a giant

803
00:53:33,925 --> 00:53:35,685
Speaker 4:  American flag mount to the back of it now by wall.

804
00:53:37,265 --> 00:53:38,325
Speaker 4:  So there's like a bunch of

805
00:53:40,655 --> 00:53:44,605
Speaker 4:  great If, you know, it came home from JFK yesterday and it Uber has a bunch

806
00:53:44,605 --> 00:53:47,165
Speaker 4:  of choices at the airport. Like, do you want Uber comfort? Do you want business

807
00:53:47,165 --> 00:53:50,765
Speaker 4:  comfort? Do you want Uber Electric or whatever? If I could pick giant

808
00:53:51,125 --> 00:53:51,805
Speaker 4:  American Flag truck,

809
00:53:52,085 --> 00:53:53,685
Speaker 2:  Uber, patriot, I would

810
00:53:56,325 --> 00:54:00,285
Speaker 4:  Uber Raptor. Like I would take, it's good. I'm just saying, you know me,

811
00:54:00,805 --> 00:54:04,765
Speaker 4:  I would take it. All right. Lots of AI stuff, lots

812
00:54:04,765 --> 00:54:08,605
Speaker 4:  of gadget stuff. Just a big mix of companies

813
00:54:08,605 --> 00:54:11,565
Speaker 4:  trying to figure out what on earth is going on. I I would say,

814
00:54:12,475 --> 00:54:15,525
Speaker 2:  Yeah, what do we do now? What do we do here? Is like a real question facing

815
00:54:15,545 --> 00:54:16,685
Speaker 2:  the tech industry at this moment.

816
00:54:16,925 --> 00:54:20,885
Speaker 4:  So let's start with Amazon. Just bundle these up. So

817
00:54:20,955 --> 00:54:24,205
Speaker 4:  there's a lot of rumors about what's gonna happen with the next version of

818
00:54:24,205 --> 00:54:28,125
Speaker 4:  Alexa. There was some reporting earlier this week that Amazon

819
00:54:28,125 --> 00:54:29,925
Speaker 4:  really wants to roll it out, but it's still too slow.

820
00:54:30,305 --> 00:54:33,845
Speaker 2:  Yep. It's tough. I, the, the, the vibes

821
00:54:34,025 --> 00:54:37,965
Speaker 2:  coming out of Amazon about what Alexa is and might be when

822
00:54:37,965 --> 00:54:41,805
Speaker 2:  it comes out next. Just keep getting worse. Yeah. And

823
00:54:42,105 --> 00:54:45,045
Speaker 2:  it was supposed to launch on October. It's now the end of November,

824
00:54:46,065 --> 00:54:50,005
Speaker 2:  and I would say there is no sign of it yet. And it's, it's one

825
00:54:50,005 --> 00:54:53,325
Speaker 2:  of those things like you, you kind of get to the point where once these things

826
00:54:53,325 --> 00:54:57,245
Speaker 2:  have been leaked in the way that they have several different times

827
00:54:57,385 --> 00:55:01,365
Speaker 2:  in several different ways, it starts to become clear. This is like,

828
00:55:01,435 --> 00:55:05,405
Speaker 2:  this is people who think this is a problem and want to talk about it.

829
00:55:05,405 --> 00:55:09,045
Speaker 2:  Right? It's like, it was like, it's, it, there is so much

830
00:55:09,095 --> 00:55:12,605
Speaker 2:  smoke now that it's like this. There's something really problematic happening

831
00:55:12,605 --> 00:55:12,765
Speaker 2:  here.

832
00:55:13,065 --> 00:55:15,685
Speaker 4:  But, and then there's smoke on the other side, which is they've all been

833
00:55:15,685 --> 00:55:19,605
Speaker 4:  leaked in the other way in like big hypey ways to like juice stock

834
00:55:19,605 --> 00:55:23,285
Speaker 4:  prices and make everyone think that, you know, they're not gonna get

835
00:55:23,285 --> 00:55:27,165
Speaker 4:  lapped by open ai. Like Jesus will, digital Jesus will

836
00:55:27,165 --> 00:55:30,965
Speaker 4:  turn on your lights soon, we promise. Yeah. Is like a pro is

837
00:55:30,965 --> 00:55:34,245
Speaker 4:  is like a thing that all these companies are saying, and then the reality

838
00:55:34,245 --> 00:55:38,005
Speaker 4:  of building those products is still very challenging. Yes. So

839
00:55:38,005 --> 00:55:41,165
Speaker 4:  here you have Amazon, which I think suffered the most

840
00:55:41,715 --> 00:55:45,525
Speaker 4:  from the first wave of like chatbots. Like why wasn't Alexa doing

841
00:55:45,525 --> 00:55:49,125
Speaker 4:  this already? Totally right. You, you didn't even have an

842
00:55:49,125 --> 00:55:52,525
Speaker 4:  iPhone services business to distract you the way that Apple got distracted

843
00:55:52,525 --> 00:55:56,485
Speaker 4:  from Siri. Like you didn't have some cash cow, you just had like, this

844
00:55:56,485 --> 00:56:00,085
Speaker 4:  was your bet. You wanted Alexa to be Windows, the interface is voice.

845
00:56:00,915 --> 00:56:03,645
Speaker 4:  This is the platform shift is we can talk to computers, they can talk to

846
00:56:03,645 --> 00:56:07,085
Speaker 4:  us like, where, what are you doing? And the answer is, don't worry, we got

847
00:56:07,085 --> 00:56:11,045
Speaker 4:  it. And it seems like yep. They they wanted to agency stuff,

848
00:56:11,045 --> 00:56:13,765
Speaker 4:  they want it to call an Uber for you. They wanted to go buy concert tickets

849
00:56:14,925 --> 00:56:16,845
Speaker 4:  probably in the same way that everybody's talking about, right? Which is

850
00:56:16,845 --> 00:56:20,725
Speaker 4:  like click around on some websites on the backend and a AWS, but it's still

851
00:56:20,725 --> 00:56:21,125
Speaker 4:  too slow.

852
00:56:21,915 --> 00:56:25,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It's, it's been really interesting to me thinking about the difference

853
00:56:25,805 --> 00:56:29,525
Speaker 2:  between the way that Google reacted to chat GPT and the way that

854
00:56:29,665 --> 00:56:33,645
Speaker 2:  Amazon reacted to chat GPT. Because what Google started saying almost immediately

855
00:56:34,145 --> 00:56:37,805
Speaker 2:  was basically we built all this technology,

856
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:41,685
Speaker 2:  like these things you think you did, we invented, and we've been doing it

857
00:56:41,685 --> 00:56:45,325
Speaker 2:  for a long time. And what Google had was a lot of very good technology that

858
00:56:45,325 --> 00:56:48,805
Speaker 2:  it hadn't built into anything. And so Google all of a sudden raced

859
00:56:49,145 --> 00:56:52,885
Speaker 2:  to basically productize this stuff. It had been working on internally

860
00:56:52,945 --> 00:56:56,685
Speaker 2:  for a very long time. And I think the speed with which Gemini has become

861
00:56:57,155 --> 00:56:59,965
Speaker 2:  like ubiquitous inside of Google and also pretty good

862
00:57:00,715 --> 00:57:03,365
Speaker 2:  suggest that most of what Google was saying was true, right? Like, it, it

863
00:57:03,385 --> 00:57:07,005
Speaker 2:  had the tech and it changed the company a lot to productize it, but like

864
00:57:07,105 --> 00:57:10,565
Speaker 2:  it had it, Amazon was the opposite, right? Like Amazon had

865
00:57:11,025 --> 00:57:14,325
Speaker 2:  the thing you would think would be the product, right? Like chat GPT is coming

866
00:57:14,325 --> 00:57:18,005
Speaker 2:  out being like, we've made voice mode and it's like Alexa is just voice mode

867
00:57:18,005 --> 00:57:20,725
Speaker 2:  and we've had it for 10 years. And

868
00:57:21,795 --> 00:57:25,725
Speaker 2:  what Amazon had to do was basically say, no, no, no, we, we can build these

869
00:57:25,725 --> 00:57:29,565
Speaker 2:  underlying capabilities to the point where it it soft launched this

870
00:57:29,565 --> 00:57:33,485
Speaker 2:  thing over a year ago in the middle of a bunch of like weird personnel

871
00:57:33,485 --> 00:57:37,405
Speaker 2:  changes where Dave Limp was leaving to go run Blue Origin Panos Pane

872
00:57:37,525 --> 00:57:40,525
Speaker 2:  was leaving Microsoft to come in and run all this stuff. But like, they launched

873
00:57:40,555 --> 00:57:44,365
Speaker 2:  this thing already a year ago. They told us what it was gonna be and

874
00:57:44,365 --> 00:57:48,085
Speaker 2:  made these grand promises about how it was coming soon. And it is, it, it

875
00:57:48,085 --> 00:57:51,205
Speaker 2:  has become abundantly clearer over that last 12 months that building the

876
00:57:51,205 --> 00:57:54,925
Speaker 2:  technology is the hard part and, and

877
00:57:54,985 --> 00:57:58,365
Speaker 2:  Amazon just doesn't seem to be able to do it.

878
00:57:58,785 --> 00:58:01,765
Speaker 4:  But do you think it's the technology or do you think it's the product? I

879
00:58:01,765 --> 00:58:04,325
Speaker 4:  think the product, Amazon, you could cheat, right? You could just go pay

880
00:58:04,505 --> 00:58:08,165
Speaker 4:  OpenAI to use whatever, and you still have to turn on the lights.

881
00:58:08,425 --> 00:58:12,005
Speaker 2:  And there's some, there's some reporting and evidence that that is a thing

882
00:58:12,025 --> 00:58:15,365
Speaker 2:  Amazon is either doing or has pretty aggressively considered doing

883
00:58:16,065 --> 00:58:19,325
Speaker 2:  is just paying for that. And you're right, that then attaching all that stuff

884
00:58:19,385 --> 00:58:23,125
Speaker 2:  to the things that Alexa can already do is a challenge,

885
00:58:23,135 --> 00:58:26,085
Speaker 2:  right? Like no matter what, you can't just like write a check to open AI

886
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:28,845
Speaker 2:  and suddenly Alexa is way better. It's a lot of work. Oh,

887
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:31,645
Speaker 4:  But I, I think Sam Altman really wants everyone to believe that you can just

888
00:58:31,645 --> 00:58:32,245
Speaker 4:  write a check to.

889
00:58:32,315 --> 00:58:35,445
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I think, I think Sam Walman would love for you to believe that. And

890
00:58:35,575 --> 00:58:38,725
Speaker 2:  Dario at Anthropic is like, no, we'll do it for a smaller check, but like,

891
00:58:39,345 --> 00:58:40,125
Speaker 2:  you can't do that.

892
00:58:41,785 --> 00:58:45,645
Speaker 2:  But it, it is also If. you want to be Amazon and you wanna do this at the

893
00:58:45,645 --> 00:58:48,365
Speaker 2:  scale that they're going to, you at some point have to build it yourself.

894
00:58:48,985 --> 00:58:51,965
Speaker 2:  And there are a lot of little tentacles to doing that well,

895
00:58:52,865 --> 00:58:56,625
Speaker 2:  but the first thing is just like, what if Alexa was just a little better?

896
00:58:56,945 --> 00:59:00,225
Speaker 2:  Like, you don't, you don't have to fix it all at once. Just just do the thing

897
00:59:00,225 --> 00:59:03,345
Speaker 2:  that like Apple has been doing with Siri for forever, where it just like

898
00:59:03,375 --> 00:59:05,305
Speaker 2:  quietly gets a tiny bit better all the time.

899
00:59:05,845 --> 00:59:09,305
Speaker 4:  No, I I I reject this comparison. What are you talking about? That is not

900
00:59:09,305 --> 00:59:10,625
Speaker 2:  True at all. Yeah, that's fair. That's a bad comparison.

901
00:59:10,625 --> 00:59:13,905
Speaker 4:  Yesterday I asked Siri to call my wife and it was like, no, like, and it

902
00:59:13,905 --> 00:59:17,785
Speaker 4:  did the new animation and everything, you know, like the, the

903
00:59:17,785 --> 00:59:21,565
Speaker 4:  glow, the screen glow. Yeah. It's like beautiful. And I was like, call back

904
00:59:21,665 --> 00:59:25,365
Speaker 4:  and it was just like, I don't, I'm, you know, I'm off the clock, man. Like,

905
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:27,365
Speaker 4:  like it's not better.

906
00:59:27,765 --> 00:59:31,205
Speaker 2:  I tried to just set a reminder this morning. I I put my coffee mug on the

907
00:59:31,205 --> 00:59:34,685
Speaker 2:  roof of my car and then forgot it so it fell off and exploded

908
00:59:35,625 --> 00:59:38,885
Speaker 2:  and So I, I'm driving and I go on CarPlay and I'm like, Hey,

909
00:59:40,025 --> 00:59:43,245
Speaker 2:  remind me in an hour to buy a new Yeti. That was what I said. 'cause it's

910
00:59:43,245 --> 00:59:46,845
Speaker 2:  a Yeti mug. I love the thing. It's great. Yeah, what it said was, in an hour

911
00:59:47,065 --> 00:59:51,045
Speaker 2:  buy any popular was the name of the reminder. Very good. So

912
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:55,005
Speaker 2:  you're right. I take back the Siri comparison, but at any rate, if Amazon

913
00:59:55,005 --> 00:59:58,765
Speaker 2:  wants to do this, it has some of the hardest things

914
00:59:59,035 --> 01:00:02,605
Speaker 2:  already out there, right? It has hundreds of millions of devices that support

915
01:00:02,605 --> 01:00:06,445
Speaker 2:  this thing. It has a big ecosystem of devices that work on its devices. Like

916
01:00:07,105 --> 01:00:11,005
Speaker 2:  you just have to build the underlying part. And that is an

917
01:00:11,005 --> 01:00:13,925
Speaker 2:  easy thing to think is the easy part. And it is very clearly not the easy

918
01:00:13,925 --> 01:00:14,125
Speaker 2:  part.

919
01:00:14,635 --> 01:00:18,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I, and I I think with Apple you can see it's also not the easy part.

920
01:00:18,605 --> 01:00:22,565
Speaker 2:  Totally. And Apple just decided to punt it to chat GBT in a very

921
01:00:22,565 --> 01:00:23,005
Speaker 2:  real way.

922
01:00:23,545 --> 01:00:26,725
Speaker 4:  And and even that is not it, like the part where you talk to the phone and

923
01:00:26,725 --> 01:00:29,485
Speaker 4:  it goes and does stuff for you. That's not chat GBT.

924
01:00:29,785 --> 01:00:30,445
Speaker 2:  No, I

925
01:00:30,605 --> 01:00:34,405
Speaker 4:  I actually think that can you make the existing voice

926
01:00:34,405 --> 01:00:38,085
Speaker 4:  assistant incrementally better with AI is not

927
01:00:38,445 --> 01:00:42,085
Speaker 4:  possible. Like I think the way that Alexa and Siri and Google

928
01:00:42,085 --> 01:00:45,885
Speaker 4:  assistant are currently architected is they're dead

929
01:00:45,955 --> 01:00:49,765
Speaker 4:  ends. Like it's, it feels very clear that these are dead ends and that

930
01:00:49,925 --> 01:00:53,045
Speaker 4:  everyone is struggling to rebuild the general purpose

931
01:00:54,165 --> 01:00:57,685
Speaker 4:  LLM into a thing that can do that, the same stuff that

932
01:00:57,995 --> 01:01:01,325
Speaker 4:  Siri can do and then make it more capable.

933
01:01:01,985 --> 01:01:05,285
Speaker 4:  And you're, they're just stuck. Like, I don't, I don't think you can be like,

934
01:01:05,285 --> 01:01:08,645
Speaker 4:  it's Alexa the same Alexa you know and love, but sometimes it's a thousand

935
01:01:08,645 --> 01:01:11,965
Speaker 4:  times smarter. Like I don't, I don't think that that is like working

936
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:16,245
Speaker 4:  and so Yeah, we'll see, I mean I, you know, my sense is that

937
01:01:16,315 --> 01:01:20,125
Speaker 4:  they brought in Panos to make this go because they

938
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:23,805
Speaker 4:  needed strong leadership to make calls and Yep. He's as strong of a product

939
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:27,365
Speaker 4:  leader as you can get. So we'll see how it goes. But the basic

940
01:01:27,365 --> 01:01:30,325
Speaker 4:  problem of, on the one hand you have

941
01:01:31,185 --> 01:01:35,005
Speaker 4:  Sam Altman and Dario out there being like, we can build a GI on current

942
01:01:35,325 --> 01:01:38,605
Speaker 4:  hardware, which is a real thing these people have said. Yep. And then on

943
01:01:38,605 --> 01:01:42,405
Speaker 4:  the other hand, you've got Amazon being like, well it's, it's turning, it's

944
01:01:42,405 --> 01:01:44,765
Speaker 4:  turning out to be very difficult to, to switch on a light switch with the

945
01:01:44,765 --> 01:01:48,685
Speaker 4:  these tools. It's like we're just like all over the place.

946
01:01:49,085 --> 01:01:52,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Well this is why there was the, the one bit of Amazon news that I thought

947
01:01:52,045 --> 01:01:55,045
Speaker 2:  was super interesting this week was, I believe it was Business Insider that

948
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:58,965
Speaker 2:  had a story that Amazon is, instead of trying to

949
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:02,765
Speaker 2:  do all of this stuff itself and do the like agentic AI that can go use

950
01:02:02,765 --> 01:02:06,485
Speaker 2:  websites on your behalf, it's just making deals with partners

951
01:02:06,705 --> 01:02:09,165
Speaker 2:  to do this stuff, which is like a thing you and I have been talking about

952
01:02:09,165 --> 01:02:13,085
Speaker 2:  for forever, right? Like a APIs over AIS is like

953
01:02:13,925 --> 01:02:17,485
Speaker 2:  a thing I keep saying to people that like, why can't you just

954
01:02:18,635 --> 01:02:22,395
Speaker 2:  make the Uber app do it for you? Because you don't have to go

955
01:02:22,395 --> 01:02:25,995
Speaker 2:  fake the Uber app, just, just let Uber do it. And that appears to be the

956
01:02:25,995 --> 01:02:29,315
Speaker 2:  way that Amazon is going. Which I think a, you can read as a total referendum

957
01:02:29,315 --> 01:02:33,235
Speaker 2:  on how good Amazon's own AI stuff is, but also

958
01:02:33,235 --> 01:02:36,955
Speaker 2:  like they're, they're making deals with Uber so that when you say Get me

959
01:02:36,955 --> 01:02:40,835
Speaker 2:  a ride, it'll just call you an Uber and DoorDash for food

960
01:02:40,835 --> 01:02:43,595
Speaker 2:  deliveries and Ticketmaster for buying tickets to things. And

961
01:02:44,845 --> 01:02:48,675
Speaker 2:  these are ideas that raise other complicated questions like should it tell

962
01:02:48,675 --> 01:02:52,195
Speaker 2:  me that it's DoorDash doing it so that I understand the like, transparency

963
01:02:52,195 --> 01:02:54,475
Speaker 2:  of this process and the fees and who all this stuff is going to and who has

964
01:02:54,475 --> 01:02:58,235
Speaker 2:  my information. All that stuff is really complicated ui, but like

965
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:02,235
Speaker 2:  DoorDash is gonna do it better than Amazon hacking DoorDash.

966
01:03:02,415 --> 01:03:06,195
Speaker 2:  You know what I mean? So like I think that is actually

967
01:03:06,955 --> 01:03:10,155
Speaker 2:  a good sign to me that there is a, a version of Alexa that is going to be

968
01:03:10,155 --> 01:03:13,675
Speaker 2:  better at this stuff in a more integrated way that Amazon has stopped saying,

969
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:18,155
Speaker 2:  we're going to solve all of this problem with fake rabbit style AI

970
01:03:18,155 --> 01:03:21,275
Speaker 2:  where we're just gonna go use websites for you. We're just going to

971
01:03:22,335 --> 01:03:25,435
Speaker 2:  be partners with the people who know how to do this. And I think that is

972
01:03:25,435 --> 01:03:27,195
Speaker 2:  going to be the right approach for a pretty long time.

973
01:03:27,545 --> 01:03:31,035
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I mean Amazon, Amazon has the money to do it, right? I mean, you know,

974
01:03:31,085 --> 01:03:34,035
Speaker 4:  Jesse from Rabbit is like, I don't have the money to do it, so I've gotta

975
01:03:34,055 --> 01:03:37,755
Speaker 4:  do some clicking around. We'll see, I just, again,

976
01:03:38,215 --> 01:03:42,075
Speaker 4:  we can achieve a GI and current hardware, but Apple and Amazon can't

977
01:03:42,075 --> 01:03:45,715
Speaker 4:  quite deploy this stuff at scale in a way that makes sense and doesn't break

978
01:03:45,715 --> 01:03:49,645
Speaker 4:  light switches. Just something to consider. Speaking of light

979
01:03:49,805 --> 01:03:53,365
Speaker 4:  switches, there one other bit of Amazon news, which is fascinating. They

980
01:03:53,365 --> 01:03:57,205
Speaker 4:  announced new echo shows this week. Chen has the writeup Echo

981
01:03:57,205 --> 01:04:01,005
Speaker 4:  show 15 and 21, which is basically just a tv,

982
01:04:01,675 --> 01:04:05,525
Speaker 4:  like just a 21 inch echo show in your kitchen. They show it

983
01:04:05,525 --> 01:04:09,205
Speaker 4:  in their own press photos, running the fire TV interface. Like

984
01:04:09,795 --> 01:04:11,125
Speaker 4:  it's a TV with some on

985
01:04:11,165 --> 01:04:13,645
Speaker 2:  A stand with a remote. Like it's just a television.

986
01:04:13,675 --> 01:04:17,605
Speaker 4:  It's just a tv. Pretty good. People like having TVs in their kitchens in

987
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:21,525
Speaker 4:  in particular, great. They, they're doing some adaptive light stuff.

988
01:04:21,565 --> 01:04:24,365
Speaker 4:  I don't think Amazon's photo stuff is very good, but they're obviously making

989
01:04:24,405 --> 01:04:27,085
Speaker 4:  a run, put photos in here and making 'em look good. Do you

990
01:04:27,085 --> 01:04:29,725
Speaker 2:  Have a kitchen tv? Like do you have a, do you have a dedicated screen for

991
01:04:29,885 --> 01:04:30,565
Speaker 2:  watching stuff in the kitchen?

992
01:04:30,945 --> 01:04:34,125
Speaker 4:  No, we, we have a Nest hub that shows photos

993
01:04:35,195 --> 01:04:39,125
Speaker 4:  that often just mis responds to Google queries. We, we use it for setting

994
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:43,005
Speaker 4:  timers and because it is a Google device,

995
01:04:43,065 --> 01:04:46,795
Speaker 4:  you can run YouTube TV on it. Right. But it's, it's small.

996
01:04:47,025 --> 01:04:49,315
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And then our, you know, it's like our house, the first part of our

997
01:04:49,315 --> 01:04:52,755
Speaker 4:  house in gigantic. So you can just see the big TV in the kitchen. You can

998
01:04:52,755 --> 01:04:55,915
Speaker 4:  just like look across the house to that TV and to whatever extent we are

999
01:04:56,075 --> 01:04:59,955
Speaker 4:  watching tv, that is the solution. But we're just not

1000
01:04:59,955 --> 01:05:01,315
Speaker 4:  like TV people in that way.

1001
01:05:01,535 --> 01:05:02,035
Speaker 2:  That's fair.

1002
01:05:03,055 --> 01:05:06,195
Speaker 4:  And also Becky's just constantly listening to podcasts on our phone, built

1003
01:05:06,195 --> 01:05:09,875
Speaker 4:  in speakers on our phone. Like that's the real TV in our house. Yeah,

1004
01:05:09,965 --> 01:05:10,635
Speaker 4:  understood.

1005
01:05:12,695 --> 01:05:15,395
Speaker 4:  What's fascinating about these two echo shows, aside from the fact that they're

1006
01:05:15,555 --> 01:05:19,445
Speaker 4:  enormous and cheap, although a 21 inch screen with hep resolution

1007
01:05:19,445 --> 01:05:22,485
Speaker 4:  for 2 9 9, that's like some David Pierce stats right there,

1008
01:05:22,805 --> 01:05:26,685
Speaker 2:  Literally that is more expensive than my 4K TCL Pierce

1009
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:29,805
Speaker 2:  P series that is 50 inches right behind me. Yeah,

1010
01:05:29,945 --> 01:05:33,085
Speaker 4:  No, that thing looks great. I'm sure no banding in the colors.

1011
01:05:34,245 --> 01:05:38,085
Speaker 4:  It's great. 2 99 for the 15 all that's all that aside,

1012
01:05:38,105 --> 01:05:42,005
Speaker 4:  the screen's aside, they've got builtin cameras for video calling. They're

1013
01:05:42,005 --> 01:05:45,925
Speaker 4:  proud of the cameras and then they have builtin wifi thread and ZigBee radios

1014
01:05:45,925 --> 01:05:49,885
Speaker 4:  for smart home stuff. And so you just see, okay, the idea is we're

1015
01:05:49,885 --> 01:05:52,365
Speaker 4:  gonna put a little computer in your house, a little server, it's gonna connect

1016
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:55,565
Speaker 4:  everything for you. You're not gonna have a bunch of little hubs like your

1017
01:05:55,595 --> 01:05:58,845
Speaker 4:  Hugh hub or your smart things hub or whatever. It's all gonna be built into

1018
01:05:58,845 --> 01:06:01,485
Speaker 4:  this device. And then you'll have this device and this will be the locus

1019
01:06:01,485 --> 01:06:05,255
Speaker 4:  of smart home control. Also the thing you talk to and also your tv. Pretty

1020
01:06:05,575 --> 01:06:09,005
Speaker 4:  interesting whether any of that actually works or whether matter plays out

1021
01:06:09,005 --> 01:06:11,645
Speaker 4:  the way it's supposed to play out. So you can buy a bunch of stuff and still

1022
01:06:11,645 --> 01:06:15,285
Speaker 4:  control it from your iPhone and also have this home hub, but who knows? But

1023
01:06:15,465 --> 01:06:19,365
Speaker 4:  at least we're making like confident steps towards

1024
01:06:19,465 --> 01:06:23,045
Speaker 4:  you just buy this thing. Yeah. Everything connects to this thing

1025
01:06:23,385 --> 01:06:27,325
Speaker 4:  and then it is expressed out to your phones and your voice assistants or

1026
01:06:27,485 --> 01:06:30,685
Speaker 4:  whatever mess. It's still messy. Yeah. But it, you can see the idea.

1027
01:06:30,965 --> 01:06:34,085
Speaker 2:  I do think it's the right infrastructure. I mean you, you pit this against

1028
01:06:34,235 --> 01:06:37,845
Speaker 2:  what we've heard about Apple's stuff, which is very much like buy a little

1029
01:06:37,845 --> 01:06:41,805
Speaker 2:  controller for every room kind of thing. And I think, I think you're right

1030
01:06:41,805 --> 01:06:45,605
Speaker 2:  that having sort of the one big screen you can yell at from almost

1031
01:06:45,845 --> 01:06:49,405
Speaker 2:  anywhere and then your phone is actually a much closer

1032
01:06:50,105 --> 01:06:53,485
Speaker 2:  answer to the right one. And I also think, like Jen talks about this all

1033
01:06:53,485 --> 01:06:57,445
Speaker 2:  the time, having a screen with big ass buttons on it goes a really long

1034
01:06:57,445 --> 01:07:00,645
Speaker 2:  way towards making your smart house usable by actual humans.

1035
01:07:01,145 --> 01:07:05,065
Speaker 4:  It sort of does. I just want to, I will offer, I will

1036
01:07:05,065 --> 01:07:08,465
Speaker 4:  offer this one piece of evidence, okay. Which is both a huge victory and

1037
01:07:08,505 --> 01:07:11,705
Speaker 4:  a gigantic failure. There are so many ways to turn lights on and off in this

1038
01:07:11,705 --> 01:07:15,315
Speaker 4:  house, infinite ways you can, you can just speak to the heavens

1039
01:07:15,635 --> 01:07:19,235
Speaker 4:  and lights will turn off. You can just, you can just wish for lights to turn

1040
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:19,315
Speaker 4:  on

1041
01:07:19,315 --> 01:07:21,395
Speaker 2:  And off. Just yell darkness and things happen like

1042
01:07:21,395 --> 01:07:25,155
Speaker 4:  It'll happen. And so in our kitchen, which is pretty dark,

1043
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:29,995
Speaker 4:  I have hue at lights in adaptive mode. So they just turn on in

1044
01:07:29,995 --> 01:07:32,315
Speaker 4:  the morning and they're in daylight and then as the day goes on, they get

1045
01:07:32,315 --> 01:07:35,035
Speaker 4:  warmer and warmer and warmer and at the end of the day they were warm and

1046
01:07:35,035 --> 01:07:38,715
Speaker 4:  yesterday they were outta sync. And I was in California, So I get a text

1047
01:07:38,715 --> 01:07:42,335
Speaker 4:  from Becky, which is a huge victory. A huge victory.

1048
01:07:42,835 --> 01:07:46,745
Speaker 4:  She said, I hate you, the lights are the wrong color because when I

1049
01:07:46,825 --> 01:07:48,625
Speaker 4:  put them in, she's like, who gives a shit about this?

1050
01:07:48,915 --> 01:07:49,905
Speaker 2:  Right, right.

1051
01:07:50,405 --> 01:07:54,305
Speaker 4:  Now she knows this is of a, of a piece with I hate you. I

1052
01:07:54,305 --> 01:07:57,625
Speaker 4:  can see the motion smoothing on my parents' tv. I hate you. The lights are

1053
01:07:57,625 --> 01:07:58,225
Speaker 4:  the wrong color. Yep.

1054
01:07:58,365 --> 01:07:58,865
Speaker 2:  You did it.

1055
01:07:59,295 --> 01:08:00,945
Speaker 4:  Huge victory. I was like, I'm done. Welcome

1056
01:08:00,965 --> 01:08:03,065
Speaker 2:  To my particular circle of hell

1057
01:08:03,585 --> 01:08:05,865
Speaker 4:  Marriage over. Yeah. Mission accomplished.

1058
01:08:07,785 --> 01:08:08,625
Speaker 2:  I got another one

1059
01:08:09,695 --> 01:08:13,305
Speaker 4:  Onto the next. And then she was like, how do I fix it? And I was like,

1060
01:08:13,455 --> 01:08:17,325
Speaker 4:  just, there's like 50 different ways to fix this problem. You can

1061
01:08:17,325 --> 01:08:21,005
Speaker 4:  open your phone, there's scenes in home on your phone. But it

1062
01:08:21,245 --> 01:08:25,125
Speaker 4:  occurred to me that one, there's a button on one of

1063
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:29,005
Speaker 4:  our Lutron light switches. You can just push to fix it. And she didn't,

1064
01:08:29,065 --> 01:08:31,325
Speaker 4:  she was like, I don't care about that. Like I don't wanna do that. I don't

1065
01:08:31,325 --> 01:08:33,925
Speaker 4:  wanna figure out what button that is. 'cause it's like, it's just an unlabeled

1066
01:08:33,925 --> 01:08:36,645
Speaker 4:  little round button. And she don't, she was like, I don't care. And then

1067
01:08:36,685 --> 01:08:40,485
Speaker 4:  I was like, well you can go to the Nest hub and you can,

1068
01:08:40,485 --> 01:08:44,285
Speaker 4:  you can just like yell at it. She's like, I, she literally said voice

1069
01:08:44,285 --> 01:08:48,245
Speaker 4:  commands are so inefficient. And I said one day, sometime the next 50 years

1070
01:08:48,245 --> 01:08:50,685
Speaker 4:  that we were married and live in this house together, I, we didn't, you weren't

1071
01:08:50,685 --> 01:08:52,885
Speaker 4:  going to say movie time out loud just once

1072
01:08:54,475 --> 01:08:58,365
Speaker 4:  that didn't get anywhere and it got all the way to, there is an

1073
01:08:58,425 --> 01:09:02,165
Speaker 4:  old iPhone mounted on one of those new standby

1074
01:09:02,595 --> 01:09:05,765
Speaker 4:  mode stands that just shows the buttons.

1075
01:09:06,585 --> 01:09:10,485
Speaker 4:  It is next to the home, the Nest hub. They're physically next to

1076
01:09:10,845 --> 01:09:14,485
Speaker 4:  each other, but because the Nest hub doesn't see the home kit scenes,

1077
01:09:15,245 --> 01:09:19,205
Speaker 4:  I needed an old iPhone on a stand and it says kitchen day time

1078
01:09:19,325 --> 01:09:21,485
Speaker 4:  lighting. And she went and pushed that button and I was like, this is just

1079
01:09:21,525 --> 01:09:24,205
Speaker 4:  a gigantic failure. There's so many ways to accomplish this and she just

1080
01:09:24,205 --> 01:09:24,565
Speaker 4:  didn't do it.

1081
01:09:24,755 --> 01:09:26,605
Speaker 2:  Yeah. A matter will fix it.

1082
01:09:27,515 --> 01:09:30,245
Speaker 4:  Sure, sure. But b,

1083
01:09:30,785 --> 01:09:34,685
Speaker 2:  You just described the exact problem with everyone's

1084
01:09:34,685 --> 01:09:36,845
Speaker 2:  smart home. Yeah. Which is that what you end up doing is you're like, oh,

1085
01:09:36,845 --> 01:09:40,325
Speaker 2:  I've built a million ways to do everything. It's totally redundant, it totally

1086
01:09:40,325 --> 01:09:43,645
Speaker 2:  works. And it's like, no, no, no. The actual thing she wanted from you

1087
01:09:44,105 --> 01:09:48,005
Speaker 2:  is tell me to walk up to the big screen, slide the thingy, that's the

1088
01:09:48,205 --> 01:09:50,805
Speaker 2:  colors and I'm done. That's a better answer.

1089
01:09:51,055 --> 01:09:53,325
Speaker 4:  Which is more or less effectively what happened, right? Yeah. She walked

1090
01:09:53,325 --> 01:09:56,365
Speaker 4:  up to the phone on the stand, it said kitchen, daytime. And she just pushed

1091
01:09:56,365 --> 01:10:00,245
Speaker 4:  it Fine. But it, but it's a next, it was next to the Nest

1092
01:10:00,245 --> 01:10:02,725
Speaker 4:  hub, which cannot do that 'cause it doesn't support the home kit scenes.

1093
01:10:02,735 --> 01:10:04,455
Speaker 4:  Right. Which is not good.

1094
01:10:04,645 --> 01:10:07,215
Speaker 2:  Therein lies the, the actual cru of the problem.

1095
01:10:07,215 --> 01:10:09,815
Speaker 4:  But she could also should, she could have just said movie time d our phone,

1096
01:10:10,635 --> 01:10:13,295
Speaker 4:  not movie time. She could have said kitchen. She will, she will never say

1097
01:10:13,295 --> 01:10:15,415
Speaker 4:  movie time. We sit down and watch a movie. I'm like, are you gonna say it?

1098
01:10:15,415 --> 01:10:16,655
Speaker 4:  She's like, I'm never saying this.

1099
01:10:17,935 --> 01:10:21,035
Speaker 2:  And you, I'm just imagining you doing it like hammer time, just like stop

1100
01:10:21,485 --> 01:10:22,035
Speaker 2:  movie time.

1101
01:10:24,495 --> 01:10:26,075
Speaker 4:  It doesn't even do much. Turns

1102
01:10:26,075 --> 01:10:27,475
Speaker 2:  Everybody turns else leaves and you watch a movie looking,

1103
01:10:27,475 --> 01:10:30,675
Speaker 4:  It just turns off lights in one room. But it's such a funny thing to say

1104
01:10:31,345 --> 01:10:34,035
Speaker 4:  like other people have it where like the shades come down, the projector

1105
01:10:34,035 --> 01:10:34,515
Speaker 4:  turns on

1106
01:10:34,935 --> 01:10:36,195
Speaker 2:  The popcorn starts. Yeah.

1107
01:10:36,195 --> 01:10:38,675
Speaker 4:  Yeah. The whole like all this stuff happens. Mine is just like lights off

1108
01:10:38,675 --> 01:10:40,995
Speaker 4:  in one room. But it's still the funniest thing you can say's

1109
01:10:40,995 --> 01:10:42,575
Speaker 2:  Pretty good. It's pretty good.

1110
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:46,015
Speaker 4:  Alright, we'll see, we'll see if Matter can fix it. I think is the end of

1111
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:47,445
Speaker 4:  that. That

1112
01:10:47,995 --> 01:10:50,085
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Matter 1.5. I hear that's the one

1113
01:10:50,865 --> 01:10:54,805
Speaker 4:  Ai, it's funny how AI and Matter and Bluetooth are all the same, on the

1114
01:10:54,805 --> 01:10:57,885
Speaker 4:  same cadence. Like, we're gonna get there, we're gonna build digital God

1115
01:10:57,885 --> 01:10:59,125
Speaker 4:  and it's gonna turn off the lights. You guys,

1116
01:11:00,425 --> 01:11:04,405
Speaker 2:  I'd take it. Honestly, if that's the one thing digital God can do, I'm, I'm

1117
01:11:04,405 --> 01:11:04,805
Speaker 2:  ready for

1118
01:11:04,805 --> 01:11:07,605
Speaker 4:  It. Let's move on to Sonos 'cause it's of a piece with all this. So there

1119
01:11:07,605 --> 01:11:11,525
Speaker 4:  have been rumors that Sonos is gonna make like a TV streamer for a long time.

1120
01:11:11,595 --> 01:11:15,045
Speaker 4:  This is the next logical thing for them to make. A huge part of their business

1121
01:11:15,625 --> 01:11:19,005
Speaker 4:  is Soundbars and Home Theater Systems and

1122
01:11:19,505 --> 01:11:22,085
Speaker 4:  lately improving their app. Set that aside.

1123
01:11:23,385 --> 01:11:26,565
Speaker 4:  So it's been very logical. They're gonna do this. The many, many questions

1124
01:11:26,565 --> 01:11:30,525
Speaker 4:  about how Sonos could build the TV streamer. Like you need an operating

1125
01:11:30,525 --> 01:11:34,085
Speaker 4:  system, you need app support, you need all this stuff. So Bloomberg

1126
01:11:34,405 --> 01:11:38,205
Speaker 4:  reported a price, it'll hit somewhere between 150 and

1127
01:11:38,205 --> 01:11:42,005
Speaker 4:  $200. And then Chris Welch put together some

1128
01:11:42,205 --> 01:11:45,165
Speaker 4:  evidence based on some previous reporting by Yanko Rutgers, who's an excellent

1129
01:11:45,325 --> 01:11:49,125
Speaker 4:  reporter that this operating system will be

1130
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:53,305
Speaker 4:  called Ventura and be made by a company called the Trade

1131
01:11:53,305 --> 01:11:53,585
Speaker 4:  Desk.

1132
01:11:55,505 --> 01:11:57,035
Speaker 4:  This is very confusing. Do you know what's going on?

1133
01:11:57,035 --> 01:12:00,835
Speaker 2:  Here it is. Er So, okay, so the Trade Desk is an advertising company.

1134
01:12:01,105 --> 01:12:04,655
Speaker 2:  Like it's more complicated than that, but it's also not more complicated

1135
01:12:04,655 --> 01:12:08,015
Speaker 2:  than that. Like they're an advertising company and they just launched this

1136
01:12:08,015 --> 01:12:11,855
Speaker 2:  thing. The thing that Yanko reported a while ago was that the Trade

1137
01:12:11,855 --> 01:12:15,815
Speaker 2:  Desk was building a smart TV operating system. And he got a bunch of pushback,

1138
01:12:15,815 --> 01:12:19,135
Speaker 2:  including from people who just straightforwardly like, no, we're not.

1139
01:12:20,075 --> 01:12:24,055
Speaker 2:  Yes they were. And they launched it officially and it's called Ventura. The

1140
01:12:24,055 --> 01:12:27,455
Speaker 2:  Trade Desk wouldn't tell us anything about it. They wouldn't share images,

1141
01:12:27,525 --> 01:12:31,455
Speaker 2:  they wouldn't share videos, but it is apparently a thing. And it is so

1142
01:12:31,505 --> 01:12:35,375
Speaker 2:  abundantly clear that what they are doing is offering a place on

1143
01:12:35,375 --> 01:12:39,255
Speaker 2:  which you can show ads and run Netflix. That seems to be the whole vibe of

1144
01:12:39,255 --> 01:12:41,895
Speaker 2:  the thing. And they had a bunch of

1145
01:12:42,605 --> 01:12:45,575
Speaker 2:  information, you know, from, from partners and it was like

1146
01:12:46,265 --> 01:12:50,135
Speaker 2:  heads of advertising at various streaming services being like sick

1147
01:12:50,435 --> 01:12:54,375
Speaker 2:  ads. We love ads. Ads are great. And then Sonos being

1148
01:12:54,375 --> 01:12:58,215
Speaker 2:  like, we are excited to be part of this. And and like

1149
01:12:58,215 --> 01:13:02,055
Speaker 2:  you said, Chris Welch has been reporting on this for forever and he, he

1150
01:13:02,475 --> 01:13:05,495
Speaker 2:  put two and two together and is basically like, this is pretty clearly what

1151
01:13:05,825 --> 01:13:09,775
Speaker 2:  Sonos is doing. Which is weird but

1152
01:13:09,965 --> 01:13:13,735
Speaker 2:  also pretty sensible if, if you're Sonos and you're like, oh, we desperately

1153
01:13:13,735 --> 01:13:17,015
Speaker 2:  need not only for people to buy this thing, but for this to be a real

1154
01:13:17,315 --> 01:13:21,175
Speaker 2:  source of revenue for us outside of hardware, which Sonos has been

1155
01:13:21,175 --> 01:13:24,655
Speaker 2:  desperately trying to figure out how to do for a long time. And so

1156
01:13:25,455 --> 01:13:28,935
Speaker 2:  throwing in with a thing that is fundamentally about building an advertising

1157
01:13:29,135 --> 01:13:32,415
Speaker 2:  business seems like a bummer of a user experience, but

1158
01:13:33,255 --> 01:13:34,495
Speaker 2:  probably a good business for Sonos.

1159
01:13:34,715 --> 01:13:37,855
Speaker 4:  So I'm just gonna read you this paragraph from Trade Desk about Ventura.

1160
01:13:38,325 --> 01:13:42,255
Speaker 4:  Ventura represents a major advance in streaming TV operating systems as it

1161
01:13:42,415 --> 01:13:45,855
Speaker 4:  solves key issues with prevailing market systems today. Including

1162
01:13:46,175 --> 01:13:49,855
Speaker 4:  frustrating user experiences, inefficient advertising, supply chains

1163
01:13:50,195 --> 01:13:51,975
Speaker 4:  and content, conflicts of interest.

1164
01:13:52,175 --> 01:13:55,095
Speaker 2:  I mean, those are my three biggest issues. I would say, when I think about

1165
01:13:55,095 --> 01:13:59,015
Speaker 2:  what I hate about watching tv, inefficient advertising supply chains is number

1166
01:13:59,015 --> 01:14:00,215
Speaker 2:  two on the list for sure.

1167
01:14:03,215 --> 01:14:05,815
Speaker 4:  That's very good. It's very good in that

1168
01:14:07,045 --> 01:14:10,695
Speaker 4:  like, young people are just watching YouTube, like it doesn't even matter.

1169
01:14:10,725 --> 01:14:11,015
Speaker 4:  Like

1170
01:14:11,570 --> 01:14:13,885
Speaker 2:  That's a pretty efficient advertising supply chain actually. Yeah,

1171
01:14:13,885 --> 01:14:17,685
Speaker 4:  It's pretty good. It's like I watch the NFL and YouTube and

1172
01:14:17,755 --> 01:14:19,365
Speaker 4:  then the Jake Paul fight on Netflix.

1173
01:14:21,305 --> 01:14:24,525
Speaker 4:  The I I know what they mean by inefficient advertising supply chain. It's

1174
01:14:24,525 --> 01:14:28,485
Speaker 4:  my curse to know what that means. Yeah. I I don't even

1175
01:14:28,485 --> 01:14:32,405
Speaker 4:  want to tell you 'cause it's so stupid. All they mean is that when

1176
01:14:32,405 --> 01:14:35,805
Speaker 4:  you open a TV box, you have multiple apps in the TV box

1177
01:14:36,385 --> 01:14:40,285
Speaker 4:  and those apps don't know what ads you have seen. And so

1178
01:14:40,285 --> 01:14:44,165
Speaker 4:  different ad providers are selling the same ad to like Hulu and Netflix

1179
01:14:44,305 --> 01:14:45,725
Speaker 4:  and whoever else. YouTube tv

1180
01:14:47,235 --> 01:14:50,375
Speaker 4:  and the supply chain is inefficient. 'cause it can't just target you the

1181
01:14:50,375 --> 01:14:53,575
Speaker 4:  user. It's targeting apps which then have user, like this is all a mess.

1182
01:14:53,605 --> 01:14:56,295
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And Roku's entire business model is, you can't even put that stuff

1183
01:14:56,295 --> 01:14:59,495
Speaker 4:  on a Roku unless you give Roku a, a cut just like the app store.

1184
01:15:00,075 --> 01:15:02,575
Speaker 4:  And that means Roku makes money. But all these other companies are like,

1185
01:15:02,575 --> 01:15:04,735
Speaker 4:  why are we all paying this fees to run the same ads in the same box, the

1186
01:15:04,735 --> 01:15:06,775
Speaker 4:  same person and Roku's like, I don't know, I'm rich.

1187
01:15:08,105 --> 01:15:08,975
Speaker 2:  Gimme $5.

1188
01:15:09,875 --> 01:15:13,295
Speaker 4:  Is this something you can sell to a consumer? We've solved the problem If,

1189
01:15:13,295 --> 01:15:15,535
Speaker 4:  you might see the same ad a bunch of times in our, I don't

1190
01:15:15,535 --> 01:15:19,335
Speaker 2:  Know. To be fair, yes. Like honestly, if I could just stop

1191
01:15:19,335 --> 01:15:23,095
Speaker 2:  getting the one ad that I get a hundred thousand times

1192
01:15:23,295 --> 01:15:27,015
Speaker 2:  a day for a stupid HVAC cleaning company,

1193
01:15:27,165 --> 01:15:30,415
Speaker 2:  like I would, I would pay more money for that. I would You

1194
01:15:30,415 --> 01:15:32,135
Speaker 4:  Would pay more money for an efficient advertising.

1195
01:15:32,315 --> 01:15:36,215
Speaker 2:  Yes. It was. If if Peacock was like 5 99 a month, they are

1196
01:15:36,215 --> 01:15:39,655
Speaker 2:  like that 6, 9 9 a month. We'll only show you the same ad once I would pay

1197
01:15:39,655 --> 01:15:40,455
Speaker 2:  the, but they do say that

1198
01:15:40,605 --> 01:15:42,695
Speaker 4:  They pay more money and we won't show you any ads or real

1199
01:15:42,835 --> 01:15:44,815
Speaker 2:  No, no, no. That's not what I'm saying. I'm fine with ads.

1200
01:15:44,975 --> 01:15:45,855
Speaker 4:  I thought you want a middle tier.

1201
01:15:46,015 --> 01:15:49,495
Speaker 2:  I have to look at my phone sometimes, right? Like I'm good with ads. I just

1202
01:15:49,495 --> 01:15:53,255
Speaker 2:  want, I want, I want more ads. I want ad

1203
01:15:53,255 --> 01:15:54,255
Speaker 2:  variety. We'll

1204
01:15:54,255 --> 01:15:58,055
Speaker 4:  See, I just think like it's, it's great to chase a TV box. It's,

1205
01:15:58,055 --> 01:16:01,935
Speaker 4:  it's very hard. And nothing about this makes

1206
01:16:01,935 --> 01:16:05,575
Speaker 4:  me confident that they will solve the core problems, which are is like, where

1207
01:16:05,575 --> 01:16:08,815
Speaker 4:  do I find the thing I wanna watch? And sometimes it's on Netflix and Netflix

1208
01:16:08,955 --> 01:16:12,775
Speaker 4:  has no incentive to play. Like that's just real. And

1209
01:16:12,775 --> 01:16:16,295
Speaker 4:  like, and then you gotta integrate it. You gotta be able to say movie time,

1210
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:19,375
Speaker 4:  have the curtains come down, I gotta get some curtains in my house.

1211
01:16:20,195 --> 01:16:22,255
Speaker 2:  All right. There's also the question of like, why would you buy this from

1212
01:16:22,345 --> 01:16:25,975
Speaker 2:  Sonos ever? Like what, what TV streaming box could

1213
01:16:26,065 --> 01:16:27,855
Speaker 2:  Sonos possibly offer you that would be super

1214
01:16:27,855 --> 01:16:31,545
Speaker 4:  Compelling? A soundbar? Sure. I don't know that they will ever do an actual

1215
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:34,745
Speaker 4:  box. I think they will do a soundbar with a bunch of HTMI inputs and say,

1216
01:16:34,745 --> 01:16:37,745
Speaker 4:  just buy this thing. It'll sound amazing. And also it's got this streaming

1217
01:16:37,745 --> 01:16:40,745
Speaker 4:  stuff built into it. But the reality is more and more people are not buying

1218
01:16:40,745 --> 01:16:43,265
Speaker 4:  boxes at all. They're just buying the TVs and using the built-in garbage

1219
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:43,985
Speaker 4:  TV software.

1220
01:16:45,625 --> 01:16:49,605
Speaker 4:  And like is someone's gonna make a tv? Who knows? Yeah.

1221
01:16:50,325 --> 01:16:54,245
Speaker 4:  Speaking of who knows what anyone is doing in hardware. That's my

1222
01:16:54,245 --> 01:16:58,045
Speaker 4:  segue. Google is purportedly canceling the Pixel tablet. Two, it might

1223
01:16:58,045 --> 01:17:01,645
Speaker 4:  leave tablets entirely, but then also might be about to

1224
01:17:01,805 --> 01:17:04,965
Speaker 4:  reboot all of laptops and tablets. And then also there's a rumor that they're

1225
01:17:04,965 --> 01:17:06,925
Speaker 4:  gonna shut down Chrome OS and rebuild it on Android.

1226
01:17:08,285 --> 01:17:11,165
Speaker 2:  I kudos by the way. You just explained a thing that doesn't make any sense

1227
01:17:11,225 --> 01:17:13,645
Speaker 2:  in about the most sensible possible way

1228
01:17:13,765 --> 01:17:17,205
Speaker 4:  Who know what's going on. Yeah. And also The government forcing the so wrong.

1229
01:17:17,445 --> 01:17:17,965
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Right.

1230
01:17:19,555 --> 01:17:23,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I mean there is an interesting thing here that is a

1231
01:17:23,365 --> 01:17:26,285
Speaker 2:  line between those two things. Like do you remember the thing that Meta did

1232
01:17:26,285 --> 01:17:28,845
Speaker 2:  where they were like, oh, you're gonna, you're gonna make us break up our

1233
01:17:28,845 --> 01:17:31,045
Speaker 2:  messaging apps so we're gonna stitch them all together in such a way that

1234
01:17:31,045 --> 01:17:34,825
Speaker 2:  that's impossible. Like, is that what's happening here

1235
01:17:34,965 --> 01:17:37,105
Speaker 2:  as Google says, no, no, no, we shouldn't do these things.

1236
01:17:37,245 --> 01:17:41,105
Speaker 4:  No, no. That Meadows thing was ice cold was calculated. They

1237
01:17:41,105 --> 01:17:44,065
Speaker 4:  saw it come in, they made a move. They still, they haven't actually actually

1238
01:17:44,065 --> 01:17:47,805
Speaker 4:  to move. Like they're, they're short of interoperable. Yeah, but

1239
01:17:48,275 --> 01:17:49,165
Speaker 4:  this is not that

1240
01:17:50,575 --> 01:17:53,645
Speaker 2:  There is nothing ice cold or calculated about Google's hardware

1241
01:17:53,885 --> 01:17:56,365
Speaker 4:  Strategy. This is, we made another run at tablets and nothing has happened.

1242
01:17:56,465 --> 01:18:00,445
Speaker 4:  We might cancel this whole deal. Also, maybe Chromebooks should

1243
01:18:00,445 --> 01:18:03,965
Speaker 4:  run Android they said for the 50th time in the past five years.

1244
01:18:04,675 --> 01:18:07,645
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I mean I, the thing I think is interesting about this is

1245
01:18:08,905 --> 01:18:12,685
Speaker 2:  the, the Pixel tablet thing is weird. There's been some conflicting reporting

1246
01:18:12,685 --> 01:18:16,285
Speaker 2:  on a bunch of a bunch of sites that primarily report on Google and Android

1247
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:20,125
Speaker 2:  about what was coming for the Pixel tablet three. And then there was a report

1248
01:18:20,125 --> 01:18:23,445
Speaker 2:  on Android headlines that the Pixel tablet three was canceled. And then there

1249
01:18:23,725 --> 01:18:27,245
Speaker 2:  was another report that actually the thing that was canceled was not the

1250
01:18:27,245 --> 01:18:30,445
Speaker 2:  pixel tablet three, it was the pixel tablet two, which would imply that there

1251
01:18:30,445 --> 01:18:31,845
Speaker 2:  are no more pixel tablets coming.

1252
01:18:33,445 --> 01:18:36,125
Speaker 2:  I would say, what seems to be clear is that Google is getting out of the

1253
01:18:36,125 --> 01:18:40,085
Speaker 2:  tablet business in some fairly short order, which like,

1254
01:18:40,965 --> 01:18:44,165
Speaker 2:  I don't see a lot of pixel tablets in the world. I'm not super shocked by

1255
01:18:44,165 --> 01:18:48,085
Speaker 2:  this. But also, boy was it not a long time ago that

1256
01:18:48,635 --> 01:18:52,405
Speaker 2:  Rick Oslo and the whole Google crew were like, no, we're serious about this.

1257
01:18:52,405 --> 01:18:56,205
Speaker 2:  We're doing this for real. We're in it to win it. All we can do is keep making

1258
01:18:56,205 --> 01:18:59,365
Speaker 2:  stuff that people like and we're in it for the long haul and like, whoops.

1259
01:19:00,685 --> 01:19:04,325
Speaker 2:  I think the, I think the Chromebook Chrome os Android thing is

1260
01:19:05,245 --> 01:19:08,485
Speaker 2:  probably more interesting because the thing that happened not that long ago

1261
01:19:08,505 --> 01:19:12,245
Speaker 2:  is that Android and hardware all became Rick

1262
01:19:12,465 --> 01:19:16,445
Speaker 2:  Oslo's problem. And, and what you need in order to do this

1263
01:19:16,445 --> 01:19:19,445
Speaker 2:  thing that Google has tried and failed to do a thousand times, which is combined

1264
01:19:19,445 --> 01:19:23,125
Speaker 2:  Chrome OS and Android, is you need somebody to just make that call

1265
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:26,765
Speaker 2:  who can direct every single person involved what to do. And now that person

1266
01:19:26,785 --> 01:19:30,765
Speaker 2:  is Rick Oslo. and we reported a while ago that Google was

1267
01:19:30,955 --> 01:19:34,845
Speaker 2:  canceling the next Pixel book and that that was just

1268
01:19:34,845 --> 01:19:38,285
Speaker 2:  not going to be a thing. And what seems to be the case now,

1269
01:19:38,665 --> 01:19:41,485
Speaker 2:  if Google is going to get back into the laptop business, it's going to be

1270
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:45,245
Speaker 2:  something like the Pixel laptop and it's going to run Android. And

1271
01:19:45,995 --> 01:19:49,405
Speaker 2:  basically Android plus desktop class Chrome browser

1272
01:19:51,515 --> 01:19:54,705
Speaker 2:  could work. Like it's just, it's just sitting there. Right? But it requires

1273
01:19:54,785 --> 01:19:58,385
Speaker 2:  a big leap from Google to say, we're out of the

1274
01:19:58,385 --> 01:20:02,345
Speaker 2:  Chromebook business. Or to at least just say, we're doing this other thing

1275
01:20:02,345 --> 01:20:06,065
Speaker 2:  instead. Chromebooks are gonna be low end education things and we're

1276
01:20:06,195 --> 01:20:09,885
Speaker 2:  we're gonna do Android for the high end boy. Is that,

1277
01:20:10,235 --> 01:20:13,365
Speaker 2:  yeah, probably not gonna work. But it's like, it's, it's a thing you can

1278
01:20:13,365 --> 01:20:17,205
Speaker 2:  organizationally do inside of Google now I think kind of for the first

1279
01:20:17,205 --> 01:20:17,685
Speaker 2:  time ever.

1280
01:20:18,515 --> 01:20:22,205
Speaker 4:  Sure. I just think the, the promise of the Chromebook is that it is simple

1281
01:20:22,945 --> 01:20:26,895
Speaker 4:  and being like, now it's Android really gets you away from

1282
01:20:26,895 --> 01:20:30,255
Speaker 4:  that promise, right? Because you're you, and by simple what I mean is there's

1283
01:20:30,255 --> 01:20:33,255
Speaker 4:  only one, I mean you can run Android apps, not Chromebook now. And

1284
01:20:34,325 --> 01:20:36,895
Speaker 4:  it's, they've gotten vastly more complicated over the past few years. But

1285
01:20:38,605 --> 01:20:42,575
Speaker 4:  what I mean is generally the application model on a Chromebook is

1286
01:20:42,595 --> 01:20:43,015
Speaker 4:  Chrome.

1287
01:20:43,645 --> 01:20:44,405
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It's browser

1288
01:20:44,555 --> 01:20:47,885
Speaker 4:  Caps. You're gonna, you're gonna run a bunch of browser tabs and you, you

1289
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:51,205
Speaker 4:  can run most applications in browsers and that is a powerful application

1290
01:20:51,205 --> 01:20:54,445
Speaker 4:  environment and it's taken over. Most things, like most desktop apps are

1291
01:20:54,445 --> 01:20:58,205
Speaker 4:  really just web apps and various wrappers. Like that's a big idea. And they

1292
01:20:58,205 --> 01:21:01,525
Speaker 4:  have just abandoned it, kind of, which is weird. And now they're gonna have

1293
01:21:01,525 --> 01:21:05,445
Speaker 4:  to sell Chrome. So who knows? That's a joke. Yeah. But to

1294
01:21:05,445 --> 01:21:09,125
Speaker 4:  say, actually we should run this on our other operating system with a vastly

1295
01:21:09,125 --> 01:21:12,895
Speaker 4:  different application model. We're just, we're just like right back in a

1296
01:21:12,895 --> 01:21:14,135
Speaker 4:  mess now. Now it's just a laptop.

1297
01:21:14,605 --> 01:21:14,895
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

1298
01:21:15,025 --> 01:21:18,415
Speaker 4:  Right. It just, it's just a Windows laptop or a, a Mac because you've got

1299
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:21,175
Speaker 4:  the native application model and then you've got what everybody is actually

1300
01:21:21,175 --> 01:21:22,855
Speaker 4:  doing on their laptops, which just running web apps.

1301
01:21:23,105 --> 01:21:26,935
Speaker 2:  Right. And you end up in a weird iPad zone where

1302
01:21:26,935 --> 01:21:29,535
Speaker 2:  like, we're starting to see bits and pieces of this with Android as it gets

1303
01:21:29,535 --> 01:21:32,975
Speaker 2:  into Foldables, right? Where they're, they're testing the, the freeform

1304
01:21:33,045 --> 01:21:36,535
Speaker 2:  desktop windowing, which makes no sense on some Android devices.

1305
01:21:37,315 --> 01:21:39,855
Speaker 2:  Slight sense on some Android devices. And like,

1306
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:42,415
Speaker 4:  Maybe that's why they're getting outta tablets. 'cause they're just like,

1307
01:21:42,415 --> 01:21:44,615
Speaker 4:  foldables are it, and we're just gonna put all of our effort into that

1308
01:21:44,845 --> 01:21:47,535
Speaker 2:  Foldables and laptops. Like I think it's a, it's a not crazy thesis.

1309
01:21:48,005 --> 01:21:51,015
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I was, I was out with somebody who had a pixel fold the other day.

1310
01:21:51,015 --> 01:21:54,335
Speaker 4:  It wasn't Liam who bought one and returned one. I will call out our producer,

1311
01:21:55,275 --> 01:21:55,775
Speaker 4:  but I was out

1312
01:23:17,285 --> 01:23:20,045
Speaker 2:  around, I think the idea that people are going to completely stream their

1313
01:23:20,285 --> 01:23:24,205
Speaker 2:  computer is still a long way away. But this is like a, you know, I

1314
01:23:24,205 --> 01:23:28,085
Speaker 2:  need it for a developer environment at work or we're,

1315
01:23:28,085 --> 01:23:31,525
Speaker 2:  we're running our dentist office on streaming windows. Like

1316
01:23:31,835 --> 01:23:32,965
Speaker 2:  sure. I'm into it.

1317
01:23:33,845 --> 01:23:37,285
Speaker 4:  I mean, this thing just looks like a, it's a, this, when you get your first

1318
01:23:37,305 --> 01:23:40,925
Speaker 4:  job and you sit down at your first computer and your first cubicle and this

1319
01:23:40,925 --> 01:23:42,965
Speaker 4:  thing is looking at you, it's like, oh, this sucks.

1320
01:23:44,995 --> 01:23:48,805
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like that's, that's my reaction to this. David's like, I

1321
01:23:48,805 --> 01:23:51,365
Speaker 4:  wanna stream windows at my house. Yeah.

1322
01:23:51,365 --> 01:23:55,165
Speaker 2:  But the beauty of it is, unlike the crappy desktop computer

1323
01:23:55,165 --> 01:23:58,165
Speaker 2:  that you get your first day at work at the, at the, you know, accounting

1324
01:23:58,165 --> 01:24:01,845
Speaker 2:  firm, this one just runs the internet and the internet is fast

1325
01:24:01,945 --> 01:24:05,825
Speaker 2:  now. So that's good. You don't have to do much on this thing. It just

1326
01:24:05,825 --> 01:24:06,345
Speaker 2:  has to run the

1327
01:24:06,465 --> 01:24:09,425
Speaker 4:  Internet. You just have to be surveilled by your boss. Well, yeah. This thing

1328
01:24:09,425 --> 01:24:12,545
Speaker 4:  as built anyway. Built in Mouse Jiggler detect like

1329
01:24:13,245 --> 01:24:16,545
Speaker 4:  the cops come, if it detects your fake working, it

1330
01:24:16,545 --> 01:24:20,225
Speaker 2:  Is perfect. No, it is very funny. Google is like desperately trying to get

1331
01:24:20,265 --> 01:24:23,585
Speaker 2:  a, become more like Windows. And Microsoft is like, nevermind. We're done

1332
01:24:23,585 --> 01:24:25,825
Speaker 2:  being Windows. Let's just do the internet now. If, you

1333
01:24:25,825 --> 01:24:29,745
Speaker 4:  Were a member member. The first iPad was explicitly positioned by Steve

1334
01:24:29,745 --> 01:24:33,625
Speaker 4:  Jobs as not a netbook. Yeah, right. This idea that you would have a

1335
01:24:33,695 --> 01:24:37,665
Speaker 4:  thin client PC that like, maybe not stream the entire operating system but

1336
01:24:37,785 --> 01:24:41,385
Speaker 4:  just ran web apps. I mean that was the EPC.

1337
01:24:42,425 --> 01:24:46,145
Speaker 4:  I cut my PI cut my teeth writing about EPCs. Joanna Stern,

1338
01:24:46,845 --> 01:24:50,585
Speaker 4:  she became a name in the gadget world by getting netbook

1339
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:53,265
Speaker 4:  scoops by EPCs. That's

1340
01:24:53,265 --> 01:24:56,985
Speaker 2:  Very good. Were net boxes a thing? Can we, can we net NetBox is a thing.

1341
01:24:56,985 --> 01:24:57,265
Speaker 2:  Okay.

1342
01:24:57,265 --> 01:25:00,065
Speaker 4:  Yeah. They were, they were a little e whatever. And the idea was you're gonna

1343
01:25:00,065 --> 01:25:03,985
Speaker 4:  buy this cheap Linux computer that's gonna run web apps and that's

1344
01:25:03,985 --> 01:25:07,425
Speaker 4:  gonna cost $500. And then Steve Jobs was like, here's an iPad, would you

1345
01:25:07,425 --> 01:25:11,175
Speaker 4:  like a good computer? And they went away. That was

1346
01:25:11,525 --> 01:25:15,095
Speaker 4:  it's time. All right, we gotta take a break one day we're gonna have Joanna

1347
01:25:15,175 --> 01:25:16,695
Speaker 4:  back and I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna make her

1348
01:38:01,745 --> 01:38:05,285
Speaker 2:  But a lot of users and app developers are saying actually things that we

1349
01:38:05,315 --> 01:38:09,045
Speaker 2:  like, like these automatically generated leaderboards that let us compete

1350
01:38:09,045 --> 01:38:12,325
Speaker 2:  with our friends inside of these apps or like, you know,

1351
01:38:12,515 --> 01:38:16,165
Speaker 2:  summaries and things over time that let you track information. Like things

1352
01:38:16,165 --> 01:38:19,045
Speaker 2:  you can do that Strava doesn't let you do, but you can do with Strava data

1353
01:38:19,705 --> 01:38:23,685
Speaker 2:  is all just gonna disappear. And I think it's happening really fast. Strava

1354
01:38:23,685 --> 01:38:26,565
Speaker 2:  gave everybody like 30 days notice that this was happening, which is really

1355
01:38:26,635 --> 01:38:29,805
Speaker 2:  fast in, in any kind of like developer environment.

1356
01:38:30,785 --> 01:38:33,925
Speaker 2:  And so people are just kind of freaking out and I think what it will actually

1357
01:38:34,065 --> 01:38:37,925
Speaker 2:  be remains to be seen but it's, it's just one of those things that

1358
01:38:37,925 --> 01:38:38,285
Speaker 2:  is like

1359
01:38:40,235 --> 01:38:44,215
Speaker 2:  one company is in the middle of a lot of this stuff and this data

1360
01:38:44,225 --> 01:38:47,695
Speaker 2:  means a lot to people and you can read it as Strava trying to be good to

1361
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:51,615
Speaker 2:  its people and you can read it as Strava trying to close the windows so that

1362
01:38:51,615 --> 01:38:53,255
Speaker 2:  you have to use Strava more and

1363
01:38:54,905 --> 01:38:57,895
Speaker 2:  it'll, it remains to be seen which one it's actually gonna be.

1364
01:38:58,035 --> 01:39:01,975
Speaker 4:  So lemme make the comparison to, of all things Reddit. Okay. Reddit just

1365
01:39:01,975 --> 01:39:04,335
Speaker 4:  had a good quarter. Its public company profitable for the first time ever.

1366
01:39:04,995 --> 01:39:06,985
Speaker 4:  Crazy like they around for a long time,

1367
01:39:07,045 --> 01:39:08,305
Speaker 2:  20 years later. Yeah.

1368
01:39:08,925 --> 01:39:12,865
Speaker 4:  Reddit got there by going to war against its developers and its users

1369
01:39:12,965 --> 01:39:16,265
Speaker 4:  and taking what had been a pretty open ecosystem and closing it down and

1370
01:39:16,265 --> 01:39:19,145
Speaker 4:  saying, you're gonna use our app If, you wanna make another app you we're

1371
01:39:19,145 --> 01:39:22,465
Speaker 4:  gonna pay us so much money that it's not even remotely worth it. If, you

1372
01:39:22,465 --> 01:39:26,305
Speaker 4:  want to be a moderator of a sub Reddit, you're gonna play by our rules or

1373
01:39:26,305 --> 01:39:30,145
Speaker 4:  we're gonna take it away from you. And this was generally bad, right? This

1374
01:39:30,145 --> 01:39:33,465
Speaker 4:  is a large platform that pissed off. Its most important

1375
01:39:33,785 --> 01:39:37,185
Speaker 4:  constituency. I think we, we've, we've said it like the power users of Reddit

1376
01:39:37,185 --> 01:39:40,105
Speaker 4:  who moderate the subreddits, the app developers make the apps. People like,

1377
01:39:40,295 --> 01:39:44,145
Speaker 4:  they're basically like, get out like we our way the highway. Yeah. And

1378
01:39:44,245 --> 01:39:48,225
Speaker 4:  it has had effectively no negative repercussion that we can

1379
01:39:48,245 --> 01:39:51,875
Speaker 4:  see, right? Reddit's still growing. It just made money. It signed a big deal

1380
01:39:51,875 --> 01:39:55,555
Speaker 4:  with Google. People are still using Reddit. It's the only non AI

1381
01:39:55,945 --> 01:39:59,635
Speaker 4:  spam source of data for Google search. Like there's a lot going on with Reddit

1382
01:39:59,635 --> 01:40:02,835
Speaker 4:  that is positive, but they had to go through this wrenching change, which,

1383
01:40:03,695 --> 01:40:06,755
Speaker 4:  you know, can't make it on without breaking some eggs. Some very important,

1384
01:40:06,865 --> 01:40:10,795
Speaker 4:  very meaningful eggs. Yeah. Still broken. Is that Strava? Right? They're

1385
01:40:10,795 --> 01:40:13,115
Speaker 4:  just closing it down saying Screw this ecosystem. We're gonna make money

1386
01:40:13,115 --> 01:40:13,955
Speaker 4:  off of what we have here.

1387
01:40:14,535 --> 01:40:18,195
Speaker 2:  That's certainly the cynical read. And one of the things that's happening

1388
01:40:18,215 --> 01:40:22,195
Speaker 2:  is Strava is starting to build its own AI features. Like they have

1389
01:40:22,195 --> 01:40:25,235
Speaker 2:  a a v song who's been covering all this for us,

1390
01:40:25,785 --> 01:40:29,475
Speaker 2:  mentioned that, I think it's called Athlete Intelligence Strava's thing,

1391
01:40:29,475 --> 01:40:33,075
Speaker 2:  which is essentially like a summary of all of your training data that tells

1392
01:40:33,075 --> 01:40:35,915
Speaker 2:  you how you're doing. That's the kind of thing that you've been able to use

1393
01:40:35,935 --> 01:40:39,635
Speaker 2:  Strava data for in other apps. And now Strava is saying, no, you can't do

1394
01:40:39,635 --> 01:40:43,595
Speaker 2:  that, but we're doing that. And that is precisely the thing that

1395
01:40:43,595 --> 01:40:46,755
Speaker 2:  Reddit said to like third party app developers, right? Like that's, that's

1396
01:40:46,755 --> 01:40:50,475
Speaker 2:  the speech. The difference is, I think it's, I

1397
01:40:50,915 --> 01:40:53,220
Speaker 2:  I don't use Strava, So. I could be wrong about this and I would be curious

1398
01:40:53,225 --> 01:40:56,925
Speaker 2:  to hear from people who have been using Strava for a really long time. But

1399
01:40:56,925 --> 01:41:00,285
Speaker 2:  to me the switching costs out of Reddit are much higher

1400
01:41:00,675 --> 01:41:04,525
Speaker 2:  than they are out of Strava. Like If, you don't If you want something

1401
01:41:04,525 --> 01:41:07,925
Speaker 2:  like Reddit, but not Reddit. It doesn't exist. There's nowhere to go. You

1402
01:41:07,925 --> 01:41:11,645
Speaker 2:  just, there are no other places. Strava has lots of competition

1403
01:41:12,005 --> 01:41:15,165
Speaker 2:  and, and you've seen this even in like the, the forums and on ironically

1404
01:41:15,165 --> 01:41:17,925
Speaker 2:  the subreddits where people are talking about this stuff. People are encouraging

1405
01:41:17,925 --> 01:41:21,765
Speaker 2:  people to go like invest in the Garmin ecosystem more or like there are

1406
01:41:21,765 --> 01:41:25,405
Speaker 2:  other ways to track this kind of stuff. I think for people who have been

1407
01:41:25,405 --> 01:41:28,805
Speaker 2:  in this ecosystem a long time, getting out will be very hard, but

1408
01:41:29,215 --> 01:41:33,005
Speaker 2:  it'll be interesting to see if Strava can actually pull this thing off because

1409
01:41:33,845 --> 01:41:37,205
Speaker 2:  I just don't know that its Walls are quite as like high and

1410
01:41:37,205 --> 01:41:40,645
Speaker 2:  impenetrable as Reddits were, and that was Reddit's bet all along, right?

1411
01:41:40,745 --> 01:41:44,125
Speaker 2:  Was like, we can do this because fundamentally most of you like it here.

1412
01:41:44,145 --> 01:41:45,845
Speaker 2:  And also where are you gonna go? Yeah, we

1413
01:41:46,065 --> 01:41:46,845
Speaker 4:  Use Facebook groups.

1414
01:41:47,335 --> 01:41:50,765
Speaker 2:  Right, exactly. I just, I don't know that Strava has quite that same

1415
01:41:51,545 --> 01:41:55,045
Speaker 2:  tie to people. But again, I am not a Strava user. And If you are. I would,

1416
01:41:55,125 --> 01:41:58,605
Speaker 2:  I would love to hear like what the perils of leaving

1417
01:41:58,705 --> 01:41:59,565
Speaker 2:  Strava feel like.

1418
01:41:59,835 --> 01:42:03,445
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I'm very curious. I also choose not to track how much I run every day.

1419
01:42:04,685 --> 01:42:07,285
Speaker 2:  I track it just by sitting at my desk.

1420
01:42:07,705 --> 01:42:09,725
Speaker 4:  I'm like, is it zero? Was it zero again?

1421
01:42:12,145 --> 01:42:16,125
Speaker 4:  All right, that's it. Ding ding, ding. The clock went off. Imagine this,

1422
01:42:16,465 --> 01:42:19,165
Speaker 4:  you can see the future of the lightning round coming now that we're swimming

1423
01:42:19,165 --> 01:42:20,405
Speaker 4:  in cash, we

1424
01:42:20,505 --> 01:42:23,725
Speaker 2:  Can, we buy an alarm o the Nintendo's alarm clock and have that be our little

1425
01:42:23,945 --> 01:42:25,005
Speaker 2:  mascot of the lightning ground.

1426
01:42:25,455 --> 01:42:28,685
Speaker 4:  There were some documents filed by Elon Musk and his pending

1427
01:42:28,875 --> 01:42:32,765
Speaker 4:  extremely shaky loss against OpenAI, but at least it's

1428
01:42:32,765 --> 01:42:36,365
Speaker 4:  generating discovery emails between Elon,

1429
01:42:36,865 --> 01:42:40,845
Speaker 4:  Sam Altman, between the other founders of OpenAI and Sam Altman. It

1430
01:42:40,845 --> 01:42:44,445
Speaker 4:  sort of document how this company went from a

1431
01:42:44,445 --> 01:42:48,205
Speaker 4:  non-profit to Sam Altman's House of Profits.

1432
01:42:50,085 --> 01:42:53,645
Speaker 4:  I dunno what else to describe it. Like in the beginning, Elon's like Deep

1433
01:42:53,645 --> 01:42:56,765
Speaker 4:  mind to Google is gonna hire everybody. Here's some money, start a non-profit

1434
01:42:56,785 --> 01:43:00,605
Speaker 4:  so we can make ai and now we're at, we're gonna make this a for-profit company

1435
01:43:00,605 --> 01:43:04,485
Speaker 4:  control only by Sam Altman Lots in these emails. Like Kylie

1436
01:43:04,485 --> 01:43:08,325
Speaker 4:  wrote them up. But it, it really does seem like, I think the

1437
01:43:09,115 --> 01:43:13,005
Speaker 4:  Elon gave a bunch of money to Sam Altman without a contract. Step one

1438
01:43:13,555 --> 01:43:16,885
Speaker 4:  from your friend who is not your lawyer but is a lawyer and Eli Patel have

1439
01:43:16,925 --> 01:43:20,765
Speaker 4:  a contract. Yeah. With it's really hard to file a claim for breach

1440
01:43:20,765 --> 01:43:24,205
Speaker 4:  of contract without a contract is basic stuff guys. So they don't have a

1441
01:43:24,325 --> 01:43:26,725
Speaker 4:  contract. So he is inventing all these other legal theories, which are all

1442
01:43:26,725 --> 01:43:30,085
Speaker 4:  very tenuous. But the emails make it very clear

1443
01:43:30,595 --> 01:43:34,125
Speaker 4:  that Sam Altman was like, here's a non-profit and then slowly made it a for-profit

1444
01:43:34,425 --> 01:43:36,845
Speaker 4:  and it now is about to actually flip the switch, make it a for-profit.

1445
01:43:37,275 --> 01:43:41,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And also the the ways in which Sam in

1446
01:43:41,045 --> 01:43:44,765
Speaker 2:  particular has like consolidated his power over time. And all of this

1447
01:43:45,045 --> 01:43:48,165
Speaker 2:  happened almost to the day, a year after

1448
01:43:49,065 --> 01:43:53,045
Speaker 2:  the insane events of last Thanksgiving when Sam

1449
01:43:53,065 --> 01:43:56,765
Speaker 2:  got briefly fired and then came back with more power and

1450
01:43:56,915 --> 01:44:00,765
Speaker 2:  more autonomy and ability to do whatever he wants. My read

1451
01:44:00,765 --> 01:44:04,525
Speaker 2:  of this whole lawsuit and there's a, I I'll link to the blog post, I'm sorry

1452
01:44:04,525 --> 01:44:06,805
Speaker 2:  I don't remember who wrote it, but somebody just put all the emails in a

1453
01:44:06,805 --> 01:44:10,765
Speaker 2:  blog post in a row. And it is so funny to read because you can tell

1454
01:44:11,635 --> 01:44:15,405
Speaker 2:  Elon Musk's angle here is basically just to like big brother Sam

1455
01:44:15,645 --> 01:44:19,525
Speaker 2:  Altman, that he's like, listen, bucko, you couldn't have done this without

1456
01:44:19,525 --> 01:44:23,125
Speaker 2:  me. I'm the reason open AI exists. I did it,

1457
01:44:23,345 --> 01:44:26,405
Speaker 2:  but then all the bad stuff that's happened and the fact that it's not what

1458
01:44:26,405 --> 01:44:30,165
Speaker 2:  we wanted is your fault. And it's, it's very,

1459
01:44:30,395 --> 01:44:34,005
Speaker 2:  it's very funny 'cause a lot of the emails are basically Sam going to

1460
01:44:34,555 --> 01:44:38,445
Speaker 2:  Elon with every question, every problem. And Elon being like the

1461
01:44:38,505 --> 01:44:42,125
Speaker 2:  the grand fixer who's like mostly just says, throw money at the problem,

1462
01:44:42,135 --> 01:44:42,925
Speaker 2:  it'll be fine. Yeah.

1463
01:44:42,925 --> 01:44:43,805
Speaker 4:  Elon stuff, which

1464
01:44:43,805 --> 01:44:47,125
Speaker 2:  Is a, a, a theory and it seems to be working in a lot of ways for him.

1465
01:44:47,125 --> 01:44:49,725
Speaker 4:  And about half the time he says, do you wanna have one of my babies? Which

1466
01:44:49,725 --> 01:44:50,605
Speaker 4:  is Elon's other move,

1467
01:44:50,935 --> 01:44:53,685
Speaker 2:  Right? And Sam I don't think has said yes to that yet, but,

1468
01:44:53,865 --> 01:44:56,925
Speaker 4:  But an open AI board member did in fact ultimately have three of Elon's babies.

1469
01:44:56,925 --> 01:44:57,325
Speaker 4:  Correct.

1470
01:44:57,325 --> 01:44:58,925
Speaker 2:  Three of the 12 that we know about.

1471
01:45:00,545 --> 01:45:04,285
Speaker 2:  But yeah, it's, it's just, there's a lot more to come. We've heard,

1472
01:45:04,285 --> 01:45:08,005
Speaker 2:  we've seen reporting that there are a lot of messages from inside of OpenAI

1473
01:45:08,005 --> 01:45:10,565
Speaker 2:  including in like Signal and other messaging apps that we're gonna see as

1474
01:45:10,565 --> 01:45:13,605
Speaker 2:  part of this discovery. Like, we're gonna learn a lot about how this company

1475
01:45:13,645 --> 01:45:14,205
Speaker 2:  operates

1476
01:45:15,045 --> 01:45:16,005
Speaker 4:  'cause of this one lawsuit that

1477
01:45:16,035 --> 01:45:17,165
Speaker 2:  Because of this ab

1478
01:45:17,225 --> 01:45:19,965
Speaker 4:  He, I I promise you he will lose this lawsuit. Well

1479
01:45:19,965 --> 01:45:22,405
Speaker 2:  That's what I, that's that's kind of what I mean. I think this is as much

1480
01:45:22,605 --> 01:45:26,325
Speaker 2:  a push to make this stuff public as it is to win

1481
01:45:26,385 --> 01:45:30,085
Speaker 2:  the lawsuit. Like this is a e Elon Musk trying to insert

1482
01:45:30,085 --> 01:45:33,885
Speaker 2:  himself as the brains behind open AI as much as it is an attempt to

1483
01:45:34,045 --> 01:45:36,645
Speaker 2:  actually win the lawsuit, which I just find totally fascinating. Yeah,

1484
01:45:36,745 --> 01:45:39,605
Speaker 4:  And we we're gonna cover every twist and turn of it. Read the emails, read

1485
01:45:39,605 --> 01:45:43,045
Speaker 4:  Kylie's piece. It's very good. Yeah. Okay. We should end, actually can I

1486
01:45:43,045 --> 01:45:46,605
Speaker 4:  insert one extra lightning round please. Bose acquired the company that makes

1487
01:45:46,605 --> 01:45:50,365
Speaker 4:  Macintosh the super high-end speakers. I don't know why. I just

1488
01:45:50,715 --> 01:45:53,765
Speaker 4:  want to point out there's incredible amount of consolidation in high-end

1489
01:45:53,765 --> 01:45:56,565
Speaker 4:  audio, which is a very funny because

1490
01:45:57,395 --> 01:46:00,445
Speaker 4:  there's Bose, which now owns Macintosh, which like makes like

1491
01:46:00,465 --> 01:46:04,245
Speaker 4:  $10,000 amplifiers and I've always wanted one. So

1492
01:46:04,315 --> 01:46:08,245
Speaker 4:  cool. Like cool, like legitimately cool. I'm, I'm happy

1493
01:46:08,245 --> 01:46:11,285
Speaker 4:  this company continues to, to succeed

1494
01:46:21,075 --> 01:46:24,965
Speaker 4:  over there. And then there's another company that owns like

1495
01:46:24,965 --> 01:46:28,365
Speaker 4:  Pioneer and Ono and they're all the same.

1496
01:46:28,915 --> 01:46:31,965
Speaker 4:  Like, it's just bananas, like all over the,

1497
01:46:32,635 --> 01:46:35,525
Speaker 4:  like that's all consolidated over there. And now Bose owns Macintosh and

1498
01:46:35,525 --> 01:46:38,405
Speaker 4:  there's just this like wild consolidation and audio

1499
01:46:39,945 --> 01:46:43,445
Speaker 4:  and you're basically end up picking like the same products but at different

1500
01:46:43,445 --> 01:46:45,205
Speaker 4:  levels of expense because that's how they

1501
01:46:45,565 --> 01:46:48,845
Speaker 2:  Position for. So if I'm, if I'm like the kind of person who wants $10,000

1502
01:46:48,885 --> 01:46:52,845
Speaker 2:  speakers, which as you know, I obviously am, as you can tell

1503
01:46:52,845 --> 01:46:55,685
Speaker 2:  by the incredibly powerful audio setup behind me in the room here.

1504
01:46:57,545 --> 01:47:01,165
Speaker 2:  Is this good news or bad news? Like I can't, Ima I I, on the one hand,

1505
01:47:01,275 --> 01:47:05,205
Speaker 2:  Bose is like going to allow this company to keep existing. But on the

1506
01:47:05,205 --> 01:47:08,045
Speaker 2:  other hand, are these just gonna be the like

1507
01:47:09,315 --> 01:47:12,185
Speaker 2:  brand names they slap on their existing products so that they can charge

1508
01:47:12,185 --> 01:47:13,385
Speaker 2:  five times as much money for?

1509
01:47:13,655 --> 01:47:16,225
Speaker 4:  Yeah, there's a little bit of that. There's a little bit of like every car

1510
01:47:16,225 --> 01:47:19,745
Speaker 4:  company needs a name so you can like license the names to car companies.

1511
01:47:19,745 --> 01:47:23,425
Speaker 4:  Like my Jeep has Macintosh but does it really? Harmon

1512
01:47:23,425 --> 01:47:25,345
Speaker 2:  Cardin was everywhere in cars for a minute there.

1513
01:47:25,345 --> 01:47:28,505
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah. My Jeep is actually funny 'cause it runs Android and there's

1514
01:47:28,505 --> 01:47:31,705
Speaker 4:  a little Android app on the screen that puts up the blue Macintosh meters

1515
01:47:32,005 --> 01:47:35,065
Speaker 4:  and it is all That's great. And I love it. Like I was like, yep, I'm buying

1516
01:47:35,065 --> 01:47:38,665
Speaker 4:  that car. And then it's a slow Android app that is like very slow and it's

1517
01:47:38,665 --> 01:47:42,525
Speaker 4:  like the meters are like a full second behind me. Oh my God, I paid

1518
01:47:42,535 --> 01:47:45,405
Speaker 4:  extra for this. I just wanted to know this is who I am,

1519
01:47:46,425 --> 01:47:49,285
Speaker 4:  but I'm, I'm just fascinated with this market in particular because it is

1520
01:47:49,525 --> 01:47:52,885
Speaker 4:  consolidating such a high rate because consumer audio

1521
01:47:53,625 --> 01:47:57,405
Speaker 4:  is going away just like it just is, right? Yeah.

1522
01:47:57,405 --> 01:47:59,965
Speaker 4:  There's not a headphones market anymore. There's an AirPods market and then

1523
01:47:59,965 --> 01:48:03,605
Speaker 4:  everything else. Right? Right. And then, and those things are becoming wearables.

1524
01:48:03,605 --> 01:48:06,565
Speaker 4:  Like they're putting a lot of compute into those. You can see that If, you

1525
01:48:06,565 --> 01:48:08,925
Speaker 4:  buy a Samsung phone, the best headphones to buy are Samsung's headphones.

1526
01:48:09,185 --> 01:48:11,925
Speaker 4:  You buy a Pixel, the best headphones to buy a Pixel Bots If, you buy an iPhone.

1527
01:48:11,925 --> 01:48:15,085
Speaker 4:  Best headphones to buy are AirPods 'cause they're extensions of the phones

1528
01:48:15,145 --> 01:48:18,525
Speaker 4:  Now. Weird. That's a weird bad outcome that I

1529
01:48:19,075 --> 01:48:22,285
Speaker 4:  promise you happen because they took the headphones jack out of phones. And

1530
01:48:22,285 --> 01:48:25,925
Speaker 4:  so all these other companies are racing to consolidate the very, very high

1531
01:48:25,925 --> 01:48:26,885
Speaker 4:  end of the market where the money is.

1532
01:48:27,445 --> 01:48:29,805
Speaker 2:  Interesting. I never thought about like that, that headphones are now, they're

1533
01:48:29,805 --> 01:48:33,045
Speaker 2:  a phone accessory much more than they are their own gadget.

1534
01:48:33,155 --> 01:48:35,005
Speaker 4:  They're got like, that market just got wiped out,

1535
01:48:35,095 --> 01:48:38,445
Speaker 2:  Which is why everybody is trying to do those like $350 noise canceling headphones

1536
01:48:38,445 --> 01:48:40,325
Speaker 2:  because that's like the only thing left.

1537
01:48:40,625 --> 01:48:44,485
Speaker 4:  That's what's left. Yeah. And even that kind of shaky. Yeah.

1538
01:48:45,365 --> 01:48:48,485
Speaker 4:  Although I did, I, on my flight home from California yesterday, I saw so

1539
01:48:48,485 --> 01:48:49,685
Speaker 4:  many knockoff AirPod Max.

1540
01:48:50,845 --> 01:48:51,325
Speaker 2:  I believe that

1541
01:48:51,455 --> 01:48:55,205
Speaker 4:  There we were. Alright, last one. This is a good one. You take this one.

1542
01:48:55,705 --> 01:48:59,315
Speaker 2:  So we talked a lot about the, the

1543
01:48:59,475 --> 01:49:02,915
Speaker 2:  state of social last week, blue Sky being

1544
01:49:02,915 --> 01:49:06,865
Speaker 2:  ascendant, Threads being Threads. And

1545
01:49:06,885 --> 01:49:10,625
Speaker 2:  the fascinating thing that has happened in the seven days since I would say

1546
01:49:10,765 --> 01:49:14,545
Speaker 2:  is that Blue Sky has continued to grow. It's over 20 million people now

1547
01:49:15,185 --> 01:49:18,145
Speaker 2:  continues to grow at like, somewhere on the pace of like a million people

1548
01:49:18,345 --> 01:49:21,985
Speaker 2:  a day, which is huge. And Threads is

1549
01:49:21,985 --> 01:49:25,185
Speaker 2:  terrified. I would say is is the, the simple way I would put it.

1550
01:49:25,855 --> 01:49:29,345
Speaker 2:  Threads has already started copying some of the feeds. They're letting you

1551
01:49:29,345 --> 01:49:33,305
Speaker 2:  do the, the custom feeds thing. Just today,

1552
01:49:33,565 --> 01:49:35,865
Speaker 2:  you pointed this out just before we started recording, I had missed it. It

1553
01:49:35,865 --> 01:49:39,505
Speaker 2:  had happened so recently. Adam er, who runs Threads and

1554
01:49:39,505 --> 01:49:43,465
Speaker 2:  Instagram said that they're tweaking the algorithm to focus more on

1555
01:49:43,465 --> 01:49:46,905
Speaker 2:  people you follow, which people have been asking Threads for since the

1556
01:49:47,215 --> 01:49:51,205
Speaker 2:  first damn day of Threads. Yeah. And it is, it is just not

1557
01:49:51,245 --> 01:49:54,365
Speaker 2:  a coincidence that they're doing this because of and after

1558
01:49:55,105 --> 01:49:57,805
Speaker 2:  the crazy flight to Blue Sky.

1559
01:49:58,985 --> 01:50:02,885
Speaker 2:  So Threads is like moving pretty fast to start to do some of the

1560
01:50:02,885 --> 01:50:06,805
Speaker 2:  stuff that Blue Sky is doing really well. I made a joke the other day

1561
01:50:06,805 --> 01:50:10,765
Speaker 2:  that Blue Sky's legacy is going to be unfortunately the same as

1562
01:50:11,005 --> 01:50:13,605
Speaker 2:  Snapchat, which is that it's gonna have all the good ideas that get eaten

1563
01:50:13,665 --> 01:50:17,645
Speaker 2:  by Meta. And instead of Evan Spiegel being the defacto

1564
01:50:17,645 --> 01:50:21,565
Speaker 2:  product chief of Facebook, it's going to be Jay Grabber. And that

1565
01:50:21,565 --> 01:50:23,885
Speaker 2:  is coming true much faster than I expected.

1566
01:50:24,685 --> 01:50:28,285
Speaker 4:  I disagree. I disagree. Okay. A couple reasons.

1567
01:50:28,945 --> 01:50:32,725
Speaker 4:  One, you know, we should just have like a soundboard

1568
01:50:32,725 --> 01:50:35,645
Speaker 4:  where I just, you can just play clips of me talking to the Fedi verse.

1569
01:50:36,715 --> 01:50:39,765
Speaker 4:  Like ultimately these things should interoperate, right? Oh sure. So

1570
01:50:40,555 --> 01:50:44,245
Speaker 4:  Blue Sky gets some benefit if it's interoperable with Ma Iton and, and the

1571
01:50:44,405 --> 01:50:46,525
Speaker 4:  protocols are different, but I think there's just a lot of bridges that are

1572
01:50:46,525 --> 01:50:47,885
Speaker 4:  gonna get built and like that'll be fine. Yeah.

1573
01:50:47,885 --> 01:50:50,205
Speaker 2:  They, they will crosstalk pretty quickly here. I think that's coming.

1574
01:50:50,375 --> 01:50:53,885
Speaker 4:  We'll see, I mean the, the protocols are very different. Yeah. Very, very,

1575
01:50:53,885 --> 01:50:57,845
Speaker 4:  very different and wildly different levels of maturity. And honestly, Threads

1576
01:50:57,845 --> 01:51:01,765
Speaker 4:  isn't fully federated and neither is Blue Sky. Like there isn't, I think

1577
01:51:01,765 --> 01:51:04,005
Speaker 4:  now there are personal data servers that you can, you can just like run,

1578
01:51:04,005 --> 01:51:07,965
Speaker 4:  you can host, you can self-host Blue Sky, but there are no other apps like

1579
01:51:07,965 --> 01:51:11,285
Speaker 4:  the actual app of Blue Sky. Only Blue Sky makes sure. And there's pieces

1580
01:51:11,285 --> 01:51:14,565
Speaker 4:  of it that are still kind of proprietary. They're early. Yeah. They just

1581
01:51:14,565 --> 01:51:16,845
Speaker 4:  started. Yeah, they promised to do it. They haven't done it all the way yet.

1582
01:51:16,955 --> 01:51:19,005
Speaker 4:  Same with threats. They promised to do it. They haven't done it all the way

1583
01:51:19,005 --> 01:51:22,885
Speaker 4:  yet. But the network effect here will benefit both companies

1584
01:51:22,885 --> 01:51:24,525
Speaker 4:  in a way that did not happen for Snapchat.

1585
01:51:24,985 --> 01:51:26,005
Speaker 2:  That's true. I agree

1586
01:51:26,005 --> 01:51:29,765
Speaker 4:  With that. That, that should be the promise. Second Threads has not

1587
01:51:29,995 --> 01:51:33,445
Speaker 4:  boosted the best idea, which is starter packs.

1588
01:51:33,985 --> 01:51:37,685
Speaker 4:  So you can steal feeds, you can show people more people they follow.

1589
01:51:38,385 --> 01:51:40,605
Speaker 4:  But starter packs on Blue Sky are the thing,

1590
01:51:40,995 --> 01:51:43,165
Speaker 2:  They're such a great product.

1591
01:51:43,555 --> 01:51:46,485
Speaker 4:  Like I made a list of people you should follow If, you care about k-pop and

1592
01:51:46,485 --> 01:51:49,725
Speaker 4:  you publish the list and you can just hit follow and you're done. Like that

1593
01:51:49,785 --> 01:51:53,565
Speaker 4:  is driving so much growth over there. Yeah. In addition to it being

1594
01:51:53,735 --> 01:51:57,605
Speaker 4:  revon by default in addition to having multiple feeds and block lists and

1595
01:51:57,605 --> 01:52:01,285
Speaker 4:  all that stuff. But they have made it really easy to just start.

1596
01:52:01,635 --> 01:52:05,485
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Even in a way that like Twitter never figured out like the, the, there

1597
01:52:05,485 --> 01:52:08,685
Speaker 2:  were the Twitter suggested follows when you would start and that was like

1598
01:52:08,685 --> 01:52:12,325
Speaker 2:  really great for whoever made it on those lists, but it wasn't specific in

1599
01:52:12,405 --> 01:52:15,165
Speaker 2:  a way. But now you're right. You can, you can go to Blue Sky, you can type

1600
01:52:15,325 --> 01:52:18,525
Speaker 2:  in, I did this the other day. I was like, I, I like Arsenal the soccer team.

1601
01:52:18,565 --> 01:52:21,605
Speaker 2:  I just typed in Arsenal to the list of charter packs clicked follow on one

1602
01:52:21,605 --> 01:52:23,685
Speaker 2:  of them that was like all the Arsenal people. And all of a sudden my feet

1603
01:52:23,685 --> 01:52:27,525
Speaker 2:  is full of Arsenal people like it's wild that

1604
01:52:27,545 --> 01:52:31,365
Speaker 2:  no one invented this before and Blue Sky just nailed it. I think Threads

1605
01:52:31,365 --> 01:52:35,005
Speaker 2:  is going to be somewhere between one day and several

1606
01:52:35,075 --> 01:52:38,885
Speaker 2:  days from putting out something very much like that. But

1607
01:52:39,045 --> 01:52:39,805
Speaker 2:  kudos to Blue Sky.

1608
01:52:40,285 --> 01:52:44,245
Speaker 4:  I really think, and again, I'm very nervous about the First Amendment

1609
01:52:44,505 --> 01:52:48,165
Speaker 4:  and the Trump two administration. Brendan Carr,

1610
01:52:49,745 --> 01:52:53,365
Speaker 4:  you're gonna, I'm so sorry. We're gonna find some way to algorithmically

1611
01:52:53,385 --> 01:52:55,645
Speaker 4:  cut out the Brendan Carr segments of The Vergecast over the next four years.

1612
01:52:57,265 --> 01:52:59,645
Speaker 4:  But then the, those of you who like it, we're gonna find a way to turn the

1613
01:52:59,645 --> 01:53:03,565
Speaker 4:  volume up on those. Perfect. We've got, we've got ideas for podcasts.

1614
01:53:03,565 --> 01:53:07,365
Speaker 4:  Everybody. I'm nervous about it. And federation is a thing

1615
01:53:07,425 --> 01:53:11,325
Speaker 4:  is the escape hatch for social media. Yep. Right. Where I think

1616
01:53:11,325 --> 01:53:14,525
Speaker 4:  Jay Grabber can say, look, we moderate Blue Sky this way, but If you don't

1617
01:53:14,525 --> 01:53:18,365
Speaker 4:  like it. There are other servers or other apps. You can compose your own

1618
01:53:18,365 --> 01:53:21,925
Speaker 4:  moderation and you can just have it that way. And that is the, no

1619
01:53:22,165 --> 01:53:24,965
Speaker 4:  other company has built that yet. I think Threads wants that for various

1620
01:53:25,285 --> 01:53:29,245
Speaker 4:  EU reasons, right? This isn't a closed network, we're building it any

1621
01:53:29,245 --> 01:53:31,565
Speaker 4:  way you want. But If, you wanna follow our accounts on another network? You

1622
01:53:31,565 --> 01:53:35,485
Speaker 4:  can. There's, these are big ideas. Yeah. Again, they're not fully

1623
01:53:35,495 --> 01:53:39,245
Speaker 4:  baked, but they're the thing that is gonna escape a bunch of weird

1624
01:53:39,605 --> 01:53:43,325
Speaker 4:  regulatory pressure on speech on the internet. I'm excited for them. Like

1625
01:53:43,325 --> 01:53:47,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah. and we are still in kind of the rising tide lifts all boats moment,

1626
01:53:47,005 --> 01:53:50,445
Speaker 2:  right. Where like what these things are trying to do fundamentally is less

1627
01:53:50,445 --> 01:53:53,725
Speaker 2:  compete with each other and more lure people away from X and

1628
01:53:54,265 --> 01:53:58,045
Speaker 2:  the, the more, the more the balance shifts away

1629
01:53:58,045 --> 01:54:01,845
Speaker 2:  from X and into all of these other things. They

1630
01:54:01,845 --> 01:54:05,605
Speaker 2:  all stand to benefit as they interconnect. And I think they all have

1631
01:54:05,605 --> 01:54:08,125
Speaker 2:  incentives like you're saying to interconnect. It's gonna take a minute,

1632
01:54:08,345 --> 01:54:11,805
Speaker 2:  but they'll do it. But I think whether you're Blue Sky or Threads, you can

1633
01:54:11,805 --> 01:54:15,565
Speaker 2:  look at the success of the other one as a victory. Yeah.

1634
01:54:15,585 --> 01:54:19,455
Speaker 2:  As long as Threads keeps being

1635
01:54:20,115 --> 01:54:23,655
Speaker 2:  the winner. If you're, if you're outta Missouri right? Like you've, you've

1636
01:54:23,655 --> 01:54:27,575
Speaker 2:  got to, there is still some victory in being the

1637
01:54:27,575 --> 01:54:30,775
Speaker 2:  one that people are excited about. And I think Threads has lost that in a

1638
01:54:30,775 --> 01:54:33,655
Speaker 2:  pretty big way. It had it for a while. People were psyched about Threads,

1639
01:54:33,655 --> 01:54:37,575
Speaker 2:  people wanted Threads to win. And I think really quickly in

1640
01:54:37,575 --> 01:54:41,375
Speaker 2:  the last three weeks, all of that like good energy

1641
01:54:41,475 --> 01:54:44,735
Speaker 2:  has shifted to Blue Sky. And I think if you're at ary, that's the thing you

1642
01:54:44,735 --> 01:54:44,935
Speaker 2:  worry

1643
01:55:41,415 --> 01:55:43,525
Speaker 4:  inaugural one. Just say the name of the sponsor again.

1644
01:55:43,765 --> 01:55:44,685
Speaker 1:  AWS Ah,

1645
01:55:44,685 --> 01:55:47,925
Speaker 4:  That feels so good. It's beautiful. That's it's good. Beautiful. Play the

1646
01:55:47,925 --> 01:55:49,965
Speaker 4:  music again. It's the whole thing we did. I don't even know what the music

1647
01:55:49,965 --> 01:55:52,765
Speaker 4:  mission accomplished. Mission accomplished. We did it everybody. That's it.

1648
01:55:52,765 --> 01:55:55,365
Speaker 4:  That's The Vergecast. Thank you to Lauren Finer for being on the show. That's
