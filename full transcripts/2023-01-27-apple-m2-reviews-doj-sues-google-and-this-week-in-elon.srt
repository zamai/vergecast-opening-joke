Description: Today on the flagship podcast of staring directly down the barrel of a camera, The Verge's Nilay Patel, Alex Cranz, Richard Lawler, and Monica Chin start the show with an inside look at our M2 MacBook Pro and Mac Mini reviews. After that, the crew breaks down the case the US Department of Justice has filed against Google's ad business and of course we try to make sense of the latest Elon Musk shenanigans.

2
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,480
Speaker 4:  Hello and welcome to the verse, the flagship podcast. I'm

3
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,810
Speaker 4:  staring directly down the barrel of the camera,

4
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,680
Speaker 4:  whether it's your real eyes or fake computer generated

5
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:24,920
Speaker 4:  eyes.

6
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,400
Speaker 1:  These are real eyes here. These are fake, beautiful

7
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,950
Speaker 4:  Real eyes. I'm your friend Eli. I have an announcement to make.

8
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,680
Speaker 4:  This is gonna be one of the first episodes of our show in a long

9
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,760
Speaker 4:  time that we post is a video podcast to

10
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,150
Speaker 4:  YouTube. We used to do it all the time. Yeah. We used to it live on

11
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,980
Speaker 4:  video, which was a mistake

12
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,750
Speaker 4:  then to pay back the, the karmic debt of doing

13
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,730
Speaker 4:  that. He's just stopped. We stopped the video. Right. And talked for years

14
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,710
Speaker 4:  and now we've slowly started adding it back in with everything that we've

15
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,550
Speaker 4:  learned. Yeah. And what we've learned is that Richard has the invidious software

16
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,430
Speaker 4:  on his computer that makes his eyes stare

17
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,580
Speaker 4:  directly at you no matter where he's looking. And it is

18
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,140
Speaker 4:  terrifying. I can't look away. Hello Richard.

19
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,710
Speaker 5:  It's fine. These are my real eyes. This is what I actually look like.

20
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,400
Speaker 5:  This is not AI enhanced by Nvidia. I, I am offended

21
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,290
Speaker 5:  by, by this, this suggestion that I would use software to enhance

22
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,390
Speaker 5:  the way that I look at you because I always look directly at

23
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,750
Speaker 4:  You. It's so creepy.

24
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,580
Speaker 5:  That's what people say about me all the time.

25
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,830
Speaker 4:  It's a lot. We're gonna,

26
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,300
Speaker 5:  There's anything I love, it's eye contact. That's what I'm into

27
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,190
Speaker 4:  When I say karmic debt, it's like we're already accruing it. Like we

28
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,670
Speaker 4:  paid off the balance. We're like, turn the cameras back

29
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,130
Speaker 1:  Off like three episodes.

30
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,990
Speaker 4:  I'm ringing it up. Just making, making purchases that

31
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,790
Speaker 4:  we're gonna have to pay off by with AI

32
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,240
Speaker 5:  Assist. Yeah. This isn't weird at all.

33
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,100
Speaker 4:  Oh my goodness. Alex Kranz is here.

34
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,390
Speaker 1:  I am here and I've got my own camera in the studio and

35
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,200
Speaker 4:  It's great if you're in your car, you're, you're doing great

36
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,440
Speaker 4:  cuz Richard isn't looking at you. But if you're watching this on video, here's

37
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,240
Speaker 4:  Richard looking at you. All right. And

38
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,800
Speaker 4:  Monica Chen is joining us for the first segment of the show. Hey Monica.

39
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,390
Speaker 1:  Hello.

40
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,760
Speaker 4:  I you know, we're two minutes into doing this on video

41
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,320
Speaker 4:  again. There's a reason I turned the cameras off. I

42
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,280
Speaker 1:  Think we look great. I think this is the best thing we've ever done. Well,

43
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,800
Speaker 4:  Look, I I'm gonna start with some like inside. The funny thing is when I

44
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:23,960
Speaker 4:  can

45
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,310
Speaker 1:  Just now get outta my frame. I'm looking great.

46
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,160
Speaker 4:  I can just get in Alex's camera.

47
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,800
Speaker 1:  It looks like he's intently examining

48
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,520
Speaker 4:  The wall. This is the worst radio that's ever been made. Here's what I will

49
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,440
Speaker 4:  tell everyone. Just back it up inside Media Baseball. We used to do

50
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,400
Speaker 4:  it on video all the time. We were arguably ahead of our time. Yes. In

51
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,660
Speaker 4:  2011 Live streaming a podcast.

52
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,310
Speaker 1:  But podcast live streaming podcast 2011.

53
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,680
Speaker 1:  None of those things existed though

54
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,390
Speaker 4:  Younger Drunker Ne Eli on camera live.

55
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,480
Speaker 4:  Many mistakes from me.

56
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,480
Speaker 1:  Some really good gifs out there of it, by the way. It's

57
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,320
Speaker 4:  It's incredible. Some of our finest moments. Yeah. Who is

58
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,910
Speaker 4:  the Samsung guy? Big Papa Joe. It's all,

59
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,280
Speaker 4:  it's all, we hired people off the off the call-ins for the

60
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,060
Speaker 4:  podcast. It's a true story. Whatever many things happen in the ver

61
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,800
Speaker 4:  I'm sure people remember or don't. We started the ver up

62
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,720
Speaker 4:  again and we're like, this is a lot of effort for videos. Yeah. That a small

63
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,360
Speaker 4:  group of very passionate people watch. But we wanted the podcast to be

64
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,040
Speaker 4:  big and so we shut off the cameras to make a better radio show. Right.

65
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,920
Speaker 4:  And our numbers went up because we were no longer looking

66
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,670
Speaker 4:  at each other and telling each other jokes about things we could see Yeah.

67
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,400
Speaker 4:  That no one in their cars could see. Yeah. So that we were like, okay, we're

68
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,240
Speaker 4:  good at making a podcast. So fast forward 2023, everyone with a

69
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,320
Speaker 4:  podcast is like, just turn on the cameras and put it on YouTube. That's where

70
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,240
Speaker 4:  all the podcast growth is. Yeah. So now we're fully back to the future. We

71
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,720
Speaker 4:  have potentially learned something about making a better

72
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,460
Speaker 4:  podcast by just having made a podcast for a long time.

73
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,400
Speaker 4:  And we are not Alex going to do bits to

74
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,620
Speaker 4:  the camera. Never.

75
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,240
Speaker 1:  I'm not doing that today, tomorrow, ever again. Hi

Speaker 4:  All right. So if you are listening to this and we

Speaker 1:  You won't credit.

89
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,320
Speaker 4:  And Richard, we continue to stare directly at you the whole

90
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,590
Speaker 4:  time.

91
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,600
Speaker 1:  Just unblinking.

92
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,840
Speaker 4:  Can we, let's talk about this. This technology, we have a lot to talk about.

93
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,720
Speaker 4:  Monica's here to talk about MacBook Pro and Mac Mini with M two chip

94
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,610
Speaker 4:  reviews. Tesla earnings. We have a,

95
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,520
Speaker 4:  we have a headline here that just says Trouble in Alphabet City, which is

96
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,400
Speaker 4:  very good. So good. Which is just about Google. Yeah.

97
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,200
Speaker 4:  There's lots of problems for Google. Microsoft layoffs. Google, there's lots

98
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,760
Speaker 4:  to talk about. But we should talk about the fact that Nvidia released

99
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,600
Speaker 4:  this software for their video cards that lets you just stare at the

100
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,590
Speaker 4:  camera. This is not new technology, right?

101
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,080
Speaker 4:  It's built in a FaceTime. Monica you were saying it's built in a lot of

102
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,850
Speaker 6:  Laptops. We've been on the surface line for a bit.

103
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,360
Speaker 6:  Samsung has claimed to have a technology that does

104
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,280
Speaker 6:  it, which I haven't personally used it before. HP says they have

105
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,310
Speaker 6:  it. There are various people who have been trying it

106
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,180
Speaker 6:  with varying degrees of success.

107
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,570
Speaker 1:  But no one like Richard.

108
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:43,560
Speaker 4:  No. Well so the thing about Nvidia, right? It's because it, you can set

109
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,070
Speaker 4:  any video source to go through.

110
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,120
Speaker 6:  This is a, this one is is a, is a bigger

111
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,130
Speaker 6:  release.

112
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,870
Speaker 4:  So Right. Like you can't

113
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,680
Speaker 1:  Yeah cuz usually if you're doing FaceTime you have to be in the FaceTime

114
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:53,970
Speaker 1:  app

115
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:54,680
Speaker 4:  On the FaceTime

116
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,500
Speaker 1:  And it's not as nearly as your iPhone camera. Yeah.

117
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,720
Speaker 4:  And then Richard, this is just like Nvidia broadcaster and you're just pumping

118
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,220
Speaker 4:  o bs through it. What's going on here?

119
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,800
Speaker 5:  Yep. It just connects it you, I open up Nvidia

120
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,320
Speaker 5:  broadcast, pick my camera and then in our recording software, I just tell

121
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,440
Speaker 5:  it to look for Nvidia broadcast and it, it gets whatever, whatever is piped

122
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:12,720
Speaker 5:  there.

123
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,720
Speaker 1:  Which is your cartoon ice. Yes.

124
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,350
Speaker 4:  I mean it's

125
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,760
Speaker 5:  Eyes that it is drawn and occasionally you'll see, like if it decides that

126
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,880
Speaker 5:  I've looked away too far, it'll go back to my real eyes and then it will

127
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,840
Speaker 5:  turn my eyes back to you. And for me that's the creepiest part. It's

128
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,870
Speaker 5:  the animated turn.

129
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,440
Speaker 6:  Well it would be weirder if they just like blinked out and then blinked to

130
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,150
Speaker 6:  be staring at us again.

131
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,000
Speaker 5:  It's strange because it's looking, it's like looking at like a ghost mirror

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,640
Speaker 5:  of myself because I'm looking at myself down in the middle of the screen

133
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,320
Speaker 5:  and it's looking directly back, which is very

134
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:42,720
Speaker 5:  strange.

135
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,800
Speaker 4:  That's terrifying. We've done a lot of stories about this attack recently.

136
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,480
Speaker 4:  James Vincent has written a lot of stories about this kinda attack. His one

137
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,440
Speaker 4:  today is very good. It's just about people putting movies through it. Yeah.

138
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,720
Speaker 4:  So the actors are looking directly down the barrel of the

139
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,800
Speaker 1:  Lens. No, don't do that. And

140
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,680
Speaker 4:  All of it looks like high school theater, like the most

141
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,400
Speaker 4:  dramatic high school monologues that you have ever experienced. It's very

142
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,200
Speaker 4:  good. I don't know if this is the future of all video conferencing. I know

143
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,080
Speaker 4:  that it's very funny and I also know that it's been on

144
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,070
Speaker 4:  FaceTime for a minute and no one has noticed it. Yeah,

145
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:15,740
Speaker 1:  True.

146
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,480
Speaker 4:  And I think it's just because in videos, letting basically anybody pump anything

147
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:19,720
Speaker 4:  through it

148
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,430
Speaker 6:  That you And how many people use FaceTime?

149
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,840
Speaker 4:  Like lots of people. But I like my mom is not like you're looking directly

150
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,400
Speaker 4:  at the camera, aren't you? Yeah. She's more like, where's your baby? Get

151
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,680
Speaker 4:  outta my face. Like you're old and dusty.

152
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,360
Speaker 1:  Don't like

153
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,880
Speaker 4:  You. I already raised you. Show

154
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,380
Speaker 1:  Me the child.

155
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,320
Speaker 4:  All right. So this is amazing Tack Richard and enjoy. It's just

156
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,640
Speaker 4:  so weird man. I'll

157
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,560
Speaker 5:  Just flip it on and off randomly during meetings and during the, during this

158
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,280
Speaker 5:  call it's fine. No, but I, we came into a meeting

159
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,960
Speaker 5:  last week and veering our video producer. He was on and I forgot that I had

160
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,240
Speaker 5:  turned it on the first day that it came out and we were talking for about

161
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,360
Speaker 5:  10 minutes and I don't know, he must have thought I was

162
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,690
Speaker 4:  Going

163
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,560
Speaker 5:  Because like I'm just talking to him and I wasn't looking at the video preview

164
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,320
Speaker 5:  so I didn't realize it was on until until a while in and he was like, I

165
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,100
Speaker 5:  wasn't, I was gonna say something but yeah.

166
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,880
Speaker 4:  Who doesn't have an entire meeting staring only directly into their

167
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,750
Speaker 4:  webcam. I do it all the time. Actually I think it's,

168
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,840
Speaker 1:  I was like, you're really, really good at it. Like annoyingly.

169
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,130
Speaker 4:  So I like mugging directly into Theam ones. Yeah, I'm doing it right now.

170
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:23,000
Speaker 4:  So I That's enough talking about this. It's so creepy. But it's out.

171
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,840
Speaker 4:  You should go play with it if you have it in video card. The fact that you

172
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,560
Speaker 4:  can pipe any source through it I think is deeply hilarious. But I would expect,

173
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,080
Speaker 4:  again, it's in FaceTime, it's a bunch of laptops. I would bet the next generation

174
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,080
Speaker 4:  of like Apple laptops has it cause they already have the technology and they're

175
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,570
Speaker 4:  using the same chips. Which brings me to the chips. Do you see that segue?

176
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,070
Speaker 1:  Oh I like that. That was good.

177
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:44,920
Speaker 4:  I did it. I loved it. It was perfect. Sweet. All right, so Monica, you

178
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,600
Speaker 4:  have been reviewing the new MacBook Pro sixteens with

179
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,120
Speaker 4:  the M two pro, the M two max.

180
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,880
Speaker 4:  Chris Welch reviewed the MAC Mini, which is the same chip,

181
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,630
Speaker 4:  the same computer in a little case without a battery and a screen.

182
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,370
Speaker 4:  What's going on here?

183
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,920
Speaker 6:  So the MacBook Pro 16 looks very similar,

184
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,660
Speaker 6:  identical even to the 2021 MacBook Pro 16.

185
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,520
Speaker 6:  But the chip inside is called the M two instead of the M one. There's the

186
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,480
Speaker 6:  M two max and the M two pro, which is not the M

187
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,760
Speaker 6:  one max and the M one Pro, it's the, you know it's the two. Yeah, it's the

188
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,520
Speaker 6:  second one. It's

189
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,080
Speaker 1:  Dose. Yeah,

190
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,730
Speaker 6:  Dose

191
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,670
Speaker 4:  Is any good.

192
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,400
Speaker 6:  Yeah. For the workload that I do, which is you know,

193
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,390
Speaker 6:  lots of Google docs and lots of spreadsheets and lots of Zoom calls,

194
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:34,680
Speaker 6:  it's like not a noticeable difference. It's not, that's not anything that

195
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,400
Speaker 6:  it impacts. It is an upgrade in graphic

196
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,320
Speaker 6:  performance and an upgrade in CPU performance. And it is something

197
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,080
Speaker 6:  that you will notice if you are doing heavier

198
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,800
Speaker 6:  professional workloads. We saw decreases in export time. We

199
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,640
Speaker 6:  saw decreases in Xcode time. Benchmarks across the board were

200
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,280
Speaker 6:  higher. So it is a more powerful laptop. The battery life is a lot longer

201
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,690
Speaker 6:  and I think to me that's the most significant part.

202
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:03,470
Speaker 1:  Is it the same battery as last time? Like the same size battery

203
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,270
Speaker 4:  I think isn't Apple's like running right up against the limit?

204
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,600
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it is the same 100 watt hour

205
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,640
Speaker 6:  battery. So

206
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,120
Speaker 1:  That is like super impressive.

207
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,800
Speaker 6:  Well the chip is more efficient. There are two more cores on the M

208
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,120
Speaker 6:  two max than there were on the M one max. They're both efficiency

209
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,080
Speaker 6:  cores. It, it seems like a more efficient chip. I would usually

210
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,960
Speaker 6:  get around 10 hours out of the M one max. I'm getting, depending

211
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,880
Speaker 6:  on my workload, I'll get 16 to 20. Wow,

212
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,360
Speaker 4:  That's

213
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,520
Speaker 6:  Crazy. A very big difference for me. That doesn't mean everyone will see

214
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,080
Speaker 6:  that same difference. You know, people's workloads vary, people's usage habits

215
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,040
Speaker 6:  vary. But I will be very surprised if any, if

216
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,920
Speaker 6:  anyone didn't see a couple more hours at least of battery out of this machine

217
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,070
Speaker 6:  than outta the older one. Which doesn't mean I don't think anyone's necessarily

218
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,640
Speaker 6:  trying to upgrade from the M one, that would surprise me. But like if you're

219
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,250
Speaker 6:  thinking of doing that, you don't need to do that. The M one PRO and and

220
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,170
Speaker 6:  M one max are fine, but these are four people who are still

221
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,490
Speaker 6:  upgrading from Intel machines. These are big increases in power and they're

222
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:00,890
Speaker 6:  more efficient.

223
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:04,730
Speaker 1:  I mean that's like six to eight hours extra battery though. Like Neela. Do

224
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,300
Speaker 1:  you have some FOMO about your M one?

225
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,170
Speaker 4:  So I'm, I'm staring at my M one Pro. Yeah. 16 inch MacBook Pro. It's

226
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,980
Speaker 4:  still the best laptop I've ever owned and we have

227
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,970
Speaker 4:  an M two PRO 16 inch MacBook Pro. You've yet to run benchmarks

228
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,850
Speaker 4:  on it and, but we've run the benchmarks on the, on the mini with that shit.

229
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:25,330
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And it's like it's a linear increase in

230
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:29,250
Speaker 4:  performance in a linear increase in battery life. It's just like these

231
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,760
Speaker 4:  numbers are better. Yeah, yeah. In sort of exactly the way that you would

232
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,770
Speaker 4:  expect them to be. Which is kind of

233
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:38,730
Speaker 6:  Interesting. It somewhat has the vibes of like an intel, a pre AMD

234
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,600
Speaker 6:  being a competitor Intel upgrade. It's like they made the chips better.

235
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,250
Speaker 6:  They didn't feel like they had to make a giant splash with the chips.

236
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:50,130
Speaker 6:  Which is fine because the last ones that came out were a

237
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,140
Speaker 6:  giant splash.

238
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,410
Speaker 1:  So real talk kind of situations.

239
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,930
Speaker 4:  Right. And the rumors are the m threes will be on a three nanometer process.

240
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,010
Speaker 4:  Right. And that's like, that's like straight up

241
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,130
Speaker 1:  Just to straight up intel.

242
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,770
Speaker 6:  And that is the pattern that we saw from Intel pre before AMD sort of burst

243
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:08,730
Speaker 6:  on the scene as you know, making, we often had less exciting generations

244
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,890
Speaker 6:  followed by more exciting generations. It was

245
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,330
Speaker 1:  Super fun to write about those too because you'd be like, this year they're

246
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,200
Speaker 1:  10% faster you think. Cool. I said 10% faster.

247
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,450
Speaker 1:  That's all you need. Be excited. The

248
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:23,140
Speaker 6:  Number is 10 what org do you want? Yeah,

249
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,470
Speaker 4:  So I, I don't this computer rds, the M one

250
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,290
Speaker 4:  PRO 16 inch pro same battery, a hundred Kilo R battery,

251
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:33,410
Speaker 4:  which is like, it's, I think it's actually like 99 point something they like

252
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,120
Speaker 4:  sneak under the

253
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,350
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Under the plane.

254
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,130
Speaker 4:  But like this computer, I just like never plugged it in. I haven't plugged

255
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:39,850
Speaker 4:  in all day today.

256
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,610
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I mean do we go to the only, the only way I'm getting that 16

257
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,610
Speaker 6:  hour figure is I do not let it go to sleep and I have it run something constantly.

258
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,250
Speaker 6:  If I were just using this my day-to-day life, I would not need to plug in.

259
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:49,810
Speaker 1:  Yeah, you would just

260
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,250
Speaker 6:  Every couple days. That's

261
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,330
Speaker 4:  Incredible. Now I didn't get that from the M one max when we tested the M

262
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,250
Speaker 4:  one max. Right. So if I was like, I'm always on the road

263
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,440
Speaker 4:  rendering road renderers.

264
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,290
Speaker 1:  Sure, yeah.

265
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:01,610
Speaker 4:  Who

266
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,050
Speaker 6:  Isn't just driving one hand

267
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,180
Speaker 4:  Over here constantly just

268
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,010
Speaker 6:  Mobilex code. Yeah.

269
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:10,770
Speaker 4:  Maybe like, honestly maybe I'd be like, you know what, it's more power.

270
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:14,130
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And more battery life and my mobile rendering

271
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:17,690
Speaker 4:  workflow will be significantly improved. The thing that really struck me

272
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,570
Speaker 4:  reading your review is that it runs the fan and it is like a noisier

273
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:25,530
Speaker 6:  Computer. It was much noisier I was using, I was running like Puget

274
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,930
Speaker 6:  bench in the office and like people were a couple ducks over and they were

275
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,720
Speaker 6:  coming over like what is going on over here? Like that.

276
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,410
Speaker 4:  That's correct. I can't remember the last time we had a noisy Mac.

277
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,170
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So that is, and I mean that was it running on high

278
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:40,850
Speaker 6:  power mode, which like if you don't run on high power mode, you probably

279
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,490
Speaker 6:  will not get that much noise. You probably will get decreased performance.

280
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,570
Speaker 1:  But is high power mode like a thing you have to

281
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,890
Speaker 6:  Activate? Yeah. So if you go into the, the, the battery profiles you can

282
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,440
Speaker 6:  put on silent mode, you can put it on high power mode, you can put it on

283
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,200
Speaker 6:  automatic which decides which one to use based on what

284
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,600
Speaker 1:  You're doing. Which did you do for your battery

285
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,360
Speaker 6:  Test? The battery one.

286
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,240
Speaker 1:  I love that. Yeah. Okay. So like high power mode, super loud but also

287
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,360
Speaker 1:  like balls to the wall. Perform

288
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,520
Speaker 6:  Performance. Yeah. And, and there was, when I, when I ran benchmarks while

289
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,160
Speaker 6:  I was in the battery mode, they were, there was substantially decreased

290
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,680
Speaker 6:  performance. So you wanna have high power mode on if you're doing load

291
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,200
Speaker 4:  Mobile rendering. Yeah. You

292
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,950
Speaker 6:  Won't be stealthy.

293
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,800
Speaker 1:  Yeah. You won't be selling. Everybody's gonna hear I drive.

294
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,280
Speaker 1:  Everybody

295
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,160
Speaker 6:  Was hearing it was very like I I the the area behind the keyboard

296
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,200
Speaker 6:  was like very hot. Which like I've never seen from one of these MacBooks.

297
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,280
Speaker 1:  Well that's interesting though cuz that means like, so these, these are thermally

298
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,080
Speaker 1:  limited. Like that's where, where the slowdown is on this. Well

299
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,440
Speaker 4:  So actually I think this is like kind of a weird moment for Apple, right.

300
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,360
Speaker 4:  Because they have been very aggressive thermally limiting their

301
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,080
Speaker 4:  machines for quite a while. Yeah. Like the Intel MacBook errors

302
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,920
Speaker 4:  were like thermally throt, it throttling all over the place. The first generation

303
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,200
Speaker 4:  M one error in the old case design was

304
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,360
Speaker 4:  throttled all like we would've hit its limit and throttle down all the time.

305
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,200
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And the M one 13 inch MacBook Pro would be like, I'm gonna

306
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,030
Speaker 4:  run the fan and like last longer And it was like a pretty quiet fan.

307
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:05,640
Speaker 4:  This one seems like the first time apple's like, you know what, it's gonna

308
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,040
Speaker 4:  get hot and noisy and we're gonna keep that performance envelope up. Yeah.

309
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,080
Speaker 6:  And I will just be clear like that was only, that was when it was running

310
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,000
Speaker 6:  Puget Bench, which does just like the wildest things. Like it's throwing

311
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,680
Speaker 6:  effects. It's doing all this random stuff with 4K and eight K. Like if I'm

312
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,680
Speaker 6:  just like doing my like regular, like if I'm watching Better Call SA or whatever,

313
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,760
Speaker 6:  it's not like those

314
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,500
Speaker 4:  Are the two extremes.

315
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,230
Speaker 1:  The two extremes, Monica,

316
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:30,600
Speaker 4:  Either it's gonna melt down or we're gonna watch the superior

317
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,520
Speaker 4:  prequel.

318
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,200
Speaker 1:  Exactly. Those the only two things that

319
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,360
Speaker 6:  You could would ever do a MacBook, I'm just coming out and saying it is,

320
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,880
Speaker 6:  it is a, it is not, we're not back in 13 inch

321
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,440
Speaker 6:  Intel MacBook Pro land where like I open one Chrome tab and it fries itself

322
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,960
Speaker 6:  to death. Like this is still that that's not gonna happen if you're just

323
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,480
Speaker 6:  like doing Chrome or whatever. That was when it was running like the most

324
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,940
Speaker 6:  intense thing that I ran on it.

325
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,480
Speaker 4:  The other thing that really struck me about the review is you pointed out

326
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,760
Speaker 4:  that apart from Battery life where Apple is still just like way ahead of

327
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,400
Speaker 4:  everybody performance-wise, Intel is making some

328
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,490
Speaker 4:  products that can compete

329
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:06,440
Speaker 6:  It. Yeah. So this year we just went, we just came back from ces a

330
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,920
Speaker 6:  MD and Intel both announced these just absolutely wild

331
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,680
Speaker 6:  chips. There's like, Intel has a 24 quarter chip, AMT has a 16

332
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,010
Speaker 6:  core chip and that's not a big little one that's like a full

333
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:20,880
Speaker 6:  16 power cores. These, I would expect

334
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,860
Speaker 6:  these chips to be competitive with Apple on like

335
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,720
Speaker 6:  CVE scores in. So we are in a very different landscape from the

336
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,710
Speaker 6:  landscape we were in when the one max can hour Intel was just not even

337
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:36,360
Speaker 6:  holy and canceled to its performance. Where we do not expect

338
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,960
Speaker 6:  Intel a MD to compete is battery life. And I don't, I don't wanna make

339
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,840
Speaker 6:  pronouncements before I've tested the chips, but when I was talking to Jason

340
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,920
Speaker 6:  Bade from a MD at c e s, he was telling me basically like, yeah, we're not

341
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,320
Speaker 6:  targeting an audience that cares about battery life with this chip. Like

342
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,040
Speaker 6:  this is, don't care about, this is really for people who don't unplug lot's.

343
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,200
Speaker 6:  Describe it that those weren't the exact words but that was the sentiment

344
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,800
Speaker 6:  I got from, you know, talking to a number of different people who are involved

345
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,760
Speaker 6:  in the making of that stuff.

346
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,790
Speaker 4:  Rash. What were you saying?

347
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,840
Speaker 5:  I said that that's one way to describe it and another thing that I noticed,

348
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,320
Speaker 5:  the gaming performance is noticeably better. We've got a lot more GPU power

349
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,480
Speaker 5:  here and it, it seems like if you want to use your MacBook Pro to play

350
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,920
Speaker 6:  Games, right? I don't do that. I don't recommend doing that. But if you wanna

351
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,560
Speaker 6:  do it, I just need a copy of that. But if you wanna buy a MacBook Pro and

352
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,160
Speaker 6:  play ton of games on it, we saw around a 20% increase in in graphic

353
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,410
Speaker 6:  performance and that, you know, that's a noticeably better gaming experience.

354
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,240
Speaker 1:  It just means like game developers have to actually develop for the Mac.

355
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,040
Speaker 1:  And we're seeing

356
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,440
Speaker 6:  Like we're seeing more of that Apple.

357
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,400
Speaker 1:  Apple is courting these developers, these developers are starting to seem

358
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,040
Speaker 1:  a little more interested. There's more you can play now than you could a

359
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,240
Speaker 1:  couple of years ago, but it's, this is such

360
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:37,640
Speaker 4:  A low

361
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,360
Speaker 1:  Bar. It's Yeah, it's bar's on the bar. The bar is on the

362
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,560
Speaker 1:  floor. But is this going

363
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,240
Speaker 6:  Up? Yeah. It's one of those things where it's like this and I, I hate to

364
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,110
Speaker 6:  make this comparison for all kinds of reasons, but if I hadn't made comparison,

365
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:54,950
Speaker 6:  I think it's, so it's it's competitive with the RTX 30 70.

366
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,520
Speaker 6:  Okay. And oh

367
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,480
Speaker 4:  My God, they're coming over the walls with pitchforks.

368
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,960
Speaker 6:  They're coming with pitchforks. I only say that to sort of put it the cat

369
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,750
Speaker 6:  the way you can think about it, sort the way you can classify it is like

370
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,640
Speaker 6:  that is the kind of, if,

371
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,520
Speaker 6:  if you were thinking about like what kind of power do I need? If

372
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,480
Speaker 6:  that is the kind of p graphic power you are looking for, this is the

373
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,110
Speaker 6:  computer that will give you that

374
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,440
Speaker 1:  Cool.

375
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,620
Speaker 6:  Which doesn't mean, doesn't mean buy to play games

376
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,480
Speaker 1:  And, and you also can't do creepy staring down the camera lens with

377
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,510
Speaker 1:  your Apple

378
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,350
Speaker 6:  Laptop. Well apparently you can do it on FaceTime

379
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,730
Speaker 1:  Except for on FaceTime.

380
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,520
Speaker 4:  No, you can do that. I don't can you hold

381
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,600
Speaker 6:  On Now is that only on the

382
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,520
Speaker 4:  Phone? Oh, I'm not running the latest version of Makos. I it might only

383
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,080
Speaker 4:  be on the phone. This is gonna make for both horrible video and audio. Yeah.

384
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,260
Speaker 1:  Don't worry about it.

385
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,760
Speaker 4:  The other thing that caught me was basically the only other change here is

386
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,340
Speaker 4:  an H GM I spec change

387
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,260
Speaker 1:  2.1.

388
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,360
Speaker 4:  Two point. I mean, you mean what show is this? We, we need to talk about

389
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,110
Speaker 4:  the H DM I spec change for the next hour.

390
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,460
Speaker 1:  Surprise

391
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,040
Speaker 5:  Max. Don't do H D M I cec. This is something I hadn't thought about but I

392
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,760
Speaker 5:  just learned last week. It's such a strange emission. Yeah,

393
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,520
Speaker 1:  Because they don't do cec so you cannot, like a Mac right now is

394
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,260
Speaker 1:  not a recommended product for your home theater system.

395
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:13,200
Speaker 1:  And it used to be 20 years ago when

396
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,300
Speaker 1:  the Mac first came out.

397
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,160
Speaker 4:  I'm sorry, what kind of piracy situation do you need a Mac

398
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,540
Speaker 4:  in your home theater for?

399
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:23,160
Speaker 1:  You know what, sometimes you just need to acquire things from the internet

400
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,710
Speaker 1:  and you don't wanna like then transfer them over. You just want it

401
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,580
Speaker 1:  fast.

402
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,280
Speaker 4:  Can I, can I tell a very tangential story? You, you know the story. Yeah.

403
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,160
Speaker 4:  Alex actually is part of the story. Oh. So I'm off

404
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,850
Speaker 4:  Twitter. I gotta fill the time. Yeah. There's hours

405
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:41,400
Speaker 4:  to reclaim now that the Twitter's not on my phone. Yes. I look at Twitter

406
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,320
Speaker 4:  on the desktop every now and again. Sometimes I might send a tweet and then

407
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,760
Speaker 4:  500 people tweeted me like, I thought you quit Twitter. And it's like, that's

408
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,200
Speaker 4:  great. Anyway. Not on my phone. So I'm trying all these new things. I'm trying

409
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,800
Speaker 4:  not to immediately fill it with more feeds. Yeah, right. You're not trying

410
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,600
Speaker 4:  to quit cigarettes and immediately pick up nicotine gum. You're like, I'm

411
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,560
Speaker 4:  trying to, I'm trying to rewire the brain. So this last week Apple News,

412
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,640
Speaker 4:  cause I paid for Apple One, I got the, did you know there's a magazine Red

413
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,560
Speaker 4:  when I was a kid called Stereo Review. It has now turned into magazine called

414
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,240
Speaker 4:  Sam Division. They do not publish the Apple news format. They publish as

415
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,160
Speaker 4:  just PDFs. Yay. Of a print magazine, which is like super fun to

416
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,800
Speaker 4:  read. Getting back to the source. Yeah, it's, it's like good man. Like reading

417
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,080
Speaker 4:  a giant PDF magazine and iPad is like maybe Steve Jobs is

418
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,480
Speaker 4:  on full page print ad for

419
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,220
Speaker 4:  Samsung HDR 10 in this last, it's beautiful. I mean it's beautiful.

420
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,160
Speaker 4:  But they had letters to the editor about the Kalei Escape, which is like

421
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,040
Speaker 4:  a $5,000 $8,000. Yeah. Lossless

422
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,230
Speaker 4:  audio high bit rate streaming thing

423
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,680
Speaker 1:  Like the be it's the best of the best.

424
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,240
Speaker 4:  The highest quality digital video players.

425
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,960
Speaker 1:  The people who own this also have like home theater systems, like

426
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,880
Speaker 1:  $50,000.

427
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,560
Speaker 4:  They custom tag all the movies Yes. To trigger home

428
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,360
Speaker 4:  automation points as you're watching them. Oh my God. So when the credits

429
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,320
Speaker 4:  come on, you can trigger the lights to come on in

430
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,630
Speaker 1:  Your house. I need to own this.

431
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,040
Speaker 4:  I want this. So like Liam's like losing his mind. This is like Liam

432
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,960
Speaker 4:  Street. So like reading and like reading a letter to edit

433
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,560
Speaker 4:  about it and like the last line is I'm incarcerated and this is how I keep

434
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,260
Speaker 4:  up with news. Oh no. And it's like, well first Alex

435
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,810
Speaker 1:  Immediately Googles

436
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:15,760
Speaker 4:  So we can't figure out who it's, I'm just telling you, no matter where you

437
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,480
Speaker 4:  go, the AV nerds are like,

438
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,600
Speaker 1:  I need, they're there. Need to know. They need to know

439
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,520
Speaker 4:  Alex. People are everywhere. We're everywhere. And now I feel bad that I'm

440
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,280
Speaker 4:  like, who has a Mac mini in their home theater setup? Because it's the guy

441
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,950
Speaker 4:  in jail writing student review.

442
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:32,560
Speaker 1:  He's like, he's got like the little clear Mac mini. They've taken all that

443
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,360
Speaker 1:  out so you can see the inside. He's ready. He's got a six system

444
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,800
Speaker 4:  In there. Anyway, if anybody has a Kale escape, please, please let me know.

445
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,720
Speaker 4:  And I desperately want to know how you've coded your home automations to

446
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,440
Speaker 4:  trigger with the custom triggers, the movie files. I'm just thinking the

447
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:45,920
Speaker 4:  thing sounds amazing.

448
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,880
Speaker 1:  Think of like panic room and then all of the Windows shades come down

449
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,180
Speaker 1:  when they go into the room and you're like, oh, it's so immersive

450
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,040
Speaker 4:  Idx. I read the actual review in the middle of it. They're like, fast and

451
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,160
Speaker 4:  furious set looks great. I'm like escape. I'm like, it doesn't matter. Like

452
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,000
Speaker 4:  it's all the same in the end. Alright. Ht My two point, all I had to do to

453
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,960
Speaker 4:  start this conversation was mention hd and there we go. I told you

454
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,760
Speaker 4:  what show it is. So the only reason that you ha you really need 2.1 is

455
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,720
Speaker 4:  eight K, which you can support. Great. But

456
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,640
Speaker 4:  then it's really 144 hertz refresh rates. Yeah.

457
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,600
Speaker 4:  Which is only for gaming. Yeah.

458
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,460
Speaker 6:  Which I mean, you know, if you bump the settings way down on

459
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,310
Speaker 6:  two, you can maybe get there.

460
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:30,200
Speaker 4:  Wait, so you can't, you don't think you can, you you can't run 4K 1 44 on

461
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,760
Speaker 4:  this thing we

462
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,693
Speaker 6:  Got at 1920 by 1200, we got I think 1 0 3.

463
00:23:34,693 --> 00:23:35,540
Speaker 6:  Okay. FPSs

464
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,320
Speaker 1:  Did you, what what game was it to Raider? So you didn't run something

465
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,000
Speaker 1:  like a, the classic civilization for Oh I, that would've gotten

466
00:23:43,357 --> 00:23:44,120
Speaker 1:  1 44.

467
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,440
Speaker 6:  I I mean I'm, I'm sure there

468
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,070
Speaker 4:  Are like a mostly static game

469
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,680
Speaker 5:  Open up Sim city Reticulate

470
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,720
Speaker 6:  Trying. There are games where, where, I mean you can find a game where, where

471
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,050
Speaker 6:  you'll get that if you're, if you really wanna do eSports on your

472
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:59,890
Speaker 6:  MacBook Pro 16 with M one max and that two Mac imagine

473
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:00,960
Speaker 6:  of choice, bully

474
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,110
Speaker 1:  It. If you try to do eSports on a Mac,

475
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,760
Speaker 6:  I mean I would bowl you. Yeah.

476
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,550
Speaker 1:  Like I would

477
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,040
Speaker 4:  Your

478
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,510
Speaker 6:  As like why did you spend that much under

479
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,960
Speaker 1:  Time? That's just

480
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,220
Speaker 6:  At the, at at minimum. That is just such a waste of your money.

481
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,150
Speaker 4:  All right. So these feel like solid incremental upgrades.

482
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:21,120
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I mean, and I, you know, incremental upgrade is like a hot

483
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,050
Speaker 6:  buttoned word to use. I don't say that to mean that this is like

484
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:28,720
Speaker 6:  an inadequate upgrade or a boring upgrade or like objectionable

485
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,480
Speaker 6:  incremental in the sense that, you know, it's around a

486
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,240
Speaker 6:  20% CPU uplift and a 10 to 15 ish percent single

487
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,780
Speaker 6:  core

488
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:40,080
Speaker 1:  And a lot more battery. I mean like, I think we're, we're kind of discounting

489
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,380
Speaker 1:  the battery

490
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,400
Speaker 6:  And a lot more better because

491
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,040
Speaker 4:  I'm a lot to know what the battery life, the M two PRO

492
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,920
Speaker 6:  Is. I'm, I have the whole weekend blocked out. We're gonna see if I

493
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,920
Speaker 6:  can run it down in, I've canceled

494
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,200
Speaker 4:  Plans this last time. It took you the

495
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,760
Speaker 6:  Whole weekend. It took, it was agonizing. I, I've canceled plans. We are

496
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,560
Speaker 6:  gonna sit down. We are gonna run, we are gonna edit on it till it dies. But

497
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,840
Speaker 6:  yeah, it, it, it, I don't mean to say it's unexciting. It's, it's exciting

498
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,800
Speaker 6:  to see that, you know, these are increasing how quickly people

499
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,640
Speaker 6:  can do their work and they're increasing, you know, the number of things

500
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,610
Speaker 6:  they can cram into a workday. The most exciting upgrade for me

501
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:16,280
Speaker 6:  is the battery life. And that is what would make

502
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,560
Speaker 6:  biggest difference in, you know, the workload for someone like me. But that

503
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,440
Speaker 6:  also goes to show somewhat that I'm not really the target audience for this,

504
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,120
Speaker 6:  for this kind of

505
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,240
Speaker 4:  Device. You're not the stealthy mobile rendering ninja.

506
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,030
Speaker 6:  No, I'm not. Maybe for my eSports.

507
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:30,930
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

508
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:34,560
Speaker 5:  No, no. You, but you, you are a person who might work an entire day on your

509
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,440
Speaker 5:  laptop. You've been in different places. You've moved from location to location.

510
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,560
Speaker 5:  You didn't plug it in, you went to sleep, you didn't plug it in. You wake

511
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,760
Speaker 5:  up, you have something you need to do and you can't.

512
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,480
Speaker 6:  I can keep it right by my head. Can't

513
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,840
Speaker 5:  Plug it in again. It'll be

514
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,360
Speaker 1:  Fine. Yeah. Can we do a challenge for you guys when you go to wwdc

515
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,200
Speaker 1:  where you just take a 16 inch MAC Pro and don't charge it the entire time

516
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:53,730
Speaker 1:  you're there?

517
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:57,120
Speaker 4:  No, because we have to get our work done. And that is, that is the environment

518
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,960
Speaker 4:  where we actually end up killing the batteries. Cuz we, you're in a really

519
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,560
Speaker 4:  RF constrained environment. So your wifi radio is like hunting a lot. Yeah.

520
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,120
Speaker 4:  And that's actually bizarrely the thing that always ends up

521
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,190
Speaker 1:  Coming. Oh, interesting.

522
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,750
Speaker 6:  Yeah. The other thing, and I mentioned this review,

523
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:14,650
Speaker 6:  I actually am almost as excited

524
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:18,440
Speaker 6:  to see what kinds of discounts we see on the M one PRO

525
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,320
Speaker 6:  and M one max because if those laptops go below

526
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,030
Speaker 6:  $2,000, I'm going to have, I, I can't say this for sure.

527
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:29,780
Speaker 6:  I would not be surprised if I have a real hard time recommending

528
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,720
Speaker 6:  any 15 or 16 inch laptop that's not those. Yeah. Because that is just going

529
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,950
Speaker 6:  to be such a like

530
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:40,760
Speaker 6:  wildly goodbye for, for for a lower price

531
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,950
Speaker 6:  than this. Yeah.

532
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:45,520
Speaker 4:  I I'm actually, I I feel the same way about the Mac

533
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,480
Speaker 4:  Minis. Yeah. Right. Like if this generation of Mac Minis ever sees

534
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,840
Speaker 4:  a discount with the M two PRO in IT distance right now it's like sitting

535
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,680
Speaker 4:  at 600 bucks, 5 99. Yeah. If that thing gets dips

536
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,130
Speaker 4:  anywhere below five, it's like

537
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,200
Speaker 1:  Oh, so five 50, no, five.

538
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,920
Speaker 4:  No, it's, it's, it's like 4 99 99. I'm like, I'll be

539
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,350
Speaker 4:  like

540
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,560
Speaker 1:  Four 50 done. You just didn't even think.

541
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,240
Speaker 4:  Yeah, because it's, it's, it's the longevity of that machine given

542
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,160
Speaker 4:  its performance envelope. Yeah. For the things you want to do with

543
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,340
Speaker 4:  the MAC Mini. You're like, I'm gonna have this computer for 15 years,

544
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,560
Speaker 1:  But you won't be able to put in your home theater system. You will

545
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,520
Speaker 4:  Not be, that's how you get a kale

546
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,090
Speaker 4:  escape.

547
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:26,440
Speaker 1:  If

548
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,080
Speaker 4:  The Kale Escape people are listening, which I I'm sure they are.

549
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,280
Speaker 1:  Yes, a hundred percent.

550
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,080
Speaker 4:  The first time we've ever mentioned this product on this podcast,

551
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,120
Speaker 1:  They're like sitting up right now.

552
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,430
Speaker 4:  Send, send Alex a kale escape.

553
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:39,550
Speaker 1:  I I wanna, I wanna try one out please. Yeah.

554
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:43,500
Speaker 4:  It's a client server system. Yeah. So if you just buy the client,

555
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,160
Speaker 4:  you still can't do anything. You have to buy a separate like 64

556
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,350
Speaker 4:  gigabyte server,

557
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:51,960
Speaker 1:  Huge servers. And I was trying to price them out, but it's one of those

558
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,960
Speaker 1:  websites where you go and they, they're like, call us for a quote. I

559
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,360
Speaker 4:  Was like, oh, that's good. It's good.

560
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,360
Speaker 6:  Nevermind. Yeah. Yeah. I mean the elephant in the room when you're reviewing

561
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,840
Speaker 6:  something like this and you know, sort of the, the caveat you have to make

562
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,680
Speaker 6:  when you say anything good about it, it's like, these are really expensive.

563
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,000
Speaker 6:  Like they're really great. There are lots of great things about them. The

564
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,280
Speaker 6:  cheapest M two max unit is like over

565
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,160
Speaker 6:  $3,000. It is really inaccessible laptop for many,

566
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,080
Speaker 6:  many people. But so, so I'm sort of still, I'm still, you know, I

567
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,040
Speaker 6:  think it's great. I still see it as kind of a niche purchase because it is

568
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,640
Speaker 6:  in that high price point. The M one max and the M one Pro are

569
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,720
Speaker 6:  moving. It, it,

570
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,320
Speaker 4:  They come

571
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,880
Speaker 6:  More discounted. They are the much closer they are to being like very

572
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,760
Speaker 6:  accessible mainstream purchases or it's certainly more so than the M

573
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,440
Speaker 6:  two devices.

574
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,880
Speaker 4:  Again, I, that M one max, I I felt like didn't

575
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,520
Speaker 4:  quite have the ba it had the performance, but most people

576
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,440
Speaker 4:  don't need it. Yeah. Because it's mostly like extra GPU performance,

577
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,900
Speaker 4:  right? Yeah. And like what are you gonna do play games on this thing?

578
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,840
Speaker 1:  Yes. Alex is crusader. King is three King is

579
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,790
Speaker 1:  gonna play. So four,

580
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:59,720
Speaker 4:  It's the M one pro. If it comes down then like that thing is, it's

581
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,360
Speaker 4:  in such a sweet spot. Yeah.

582
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,240
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I mean my device is usually, and I, I think that based on we, we

583
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,820
Speaker 6:  haven't gotten to fully benchmark and break down the M two

584
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,760
Speaker 6:  PRO laptop yet. We do have the M two Pro Mac Mini. So we have a

585
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,520
Speaker 6:  sense of how that's going to perform. We'll have more updates

586
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,320
Speaker 6:  next week about how the laptop specifically compare. But based on what we

587
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,980
Speaker 6:  are seeing so far, I imagine it's going to be a similar situation where

588
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,800
Speaker 6:  the M two PRO is more of the everyone chip. Like that's

589
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,400
Speaker 6:  what you can get if you, you know, are doing this stuff occasionally, like

590
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,040
Speaker 6:  this stuff being like video stuff. Xcode the

591
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,640
Speaker 6:  rendering that NEI is doing all the time. If you are buying this

592
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,520
Speaker 1:  Laptop in your car,

593
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,370
Speaker 4:  Right. I'm rendering Bitcoins on the go left and right.

594
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:44,200
Speaker 6:  If you are are buying this primarily to do a graphically

595
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,080
Speaker 6:  intensive task, then it, the M two max, you'll have a better

596
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,280
Speaker 6:  time. It will save you, you know, if your job requires you to do all this

597
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,680
Speaker 6:  stuff really fast, the M two max will save you time. But the, the increase

598
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,400
Speaker 6:  is not such that it is super, super necessary for like the average buyer

599
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,380
Speaker 6:  to have it. Yeah.

600
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,160
Speaker 4:  All right. We gotta take a break. Monica, thank you so much for joining us.

601
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,840
Speaker 4:  You're welcome. We'll have more after Monica's marathon M two

602
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,720
Speaker 4:  Pro battery testing session. We'll see. He's gonna come out

603
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,590
Speaker 4:  the other side like a skeleton.

604
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,840
Speaker 6:  I'll be just a zombie. Yeah,

605
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,200
Speaker 4:  We'll have more. We'll have updates on that. We gotta take a break. We'll

606
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,240
Speaker 4:  be right back. We gotta talk about Google. Okay. We'll be right

607
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,420
Speaker 4:  back.

608
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,740
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back. It's time to talk about trouble in Alphabet City.

609
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,000
Speaker 1:  Big trouble in Alphabet

610
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,880
Speaker 4:  City, which is a real neighborhood here in New York City.

611
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,000
Speaker 1:  Yeah, but this is, this is a different alphabet, but

612
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,680
Speaker 4:  You like to normal people. If you say there's trouble in Alphabet City, they'll

613
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:53,560
Speaker 4:  be like, what did a trust fund baby run over a car? Like Yes.

614
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:57,080
Speaker 4:  Did someone not get into the club? That's not what's happening here.

615
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,920
Speaker 4:  No, it's way less fun. Yeah. So lots of Google news this

616
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,360
Speaker 4:  week. They laid off 12,000 people on Friday.

617
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,560
Speaker 4:  First mass layoffs in Google history. Major

618
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,520
Speaker 4:  culture change for Google. They've never done it before. Larry

619
00:33:11,693 --> 00:33:15,240
Speaker 4:  Page, Sege Brynn back at the company to talk it over with Sundar.

620
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,760
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Obviously they're the founders and they, they, no one knows where they've

621
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:22,080
Speaker 4:  been for years. Like Sergey is just like out, like

622
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,250
Speaker 1:  Parked came back from the Yeah,

623
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,770
Speaker 4:  Larry's trying to fly a taxi

624
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:27,380
Speaker 1:  Landed

625
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,610
Speaker 4:  In Larry Page has like five flying car startups.

626
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,220
Speaker 5:  I think it's down to like three or maybe

627
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,100
Speaker 4:  Two nights. It's just two. All right. Okay. But they're back in the building

628
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:39,060
Speaker 4:  at Google. Cause they gotta refocus big New York Times story about Google

629
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,900
Speaker 4:  calling a code red over chat G P T. We can get all to that. They have

630
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,660
Speaker 4:  12,000 people seemingly at random. Right. I'm sure that,

631
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:50,380
Speaker 4:  you know, there are reports they had hundreds of executives making, like

632
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,700
Speaker 4:  all together make sure they made the right decisions. But you know, very

633
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,620
Speaker 4:  senior people who've been at Google for 8, 10, 12 years clipped very junior

634
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,900
Speaker 4:  people who actually like, you know, it's a 12,000 people. A lot of people.

635
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,780
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So like I've seen tos from Google employees. So like I just

636
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:08,560
Speaker 4:  walked, walked out of a client meeting, whoops. Woo. You know,

637
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,540
Speaker 4:  and they're not done yet cuz they're all over the world. Lots of legal regulations,

638
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:16,340
Speaker 4:  lots of different countries. So that's just the top line. And Liz actually

639
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,500
Speaker 4:  has a great piece today about the layoffs across tech because Amazon had

640
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,640
Speaker 4:  layoffs. Stripe had layoffs. Microsoft's had layoffs just down the line.

641
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,500
Speaker 4:  And they all have the same reasoning. Spotify had layoffs. Yeah. Which

642
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,780
Speaker 4:  is, we thought that changes brought about by the

643
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,300
Speaker 4:  pandemic would would stay.

644
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,220
Speaker 1:  Which is everybody really sat there and was like, we thought everybody

645
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:40,100
Speaker 1:  sitting in their houses baking bread and crying about missing the

646
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,770
Speaker 1:  outdoors would just be the The present forever.

647
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:47,670
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like we're all gonna shop online. We're gonna watch all of our videos

648
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,860
Speaker 4:  on YouTube and Netflix. We're gonna listen to everything on Spotify. We do

649
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,340
Speaker 4:  Clubhouse. Do you remember when the tech industry tried to convince us Clubhouse

650
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:57,330
Speaker 4:  was real? And like I talk for a living. Yeah. And I was like, y'all

651
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:57,820
Speaker 4:  Uhuh.

652
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,660
Speaker 1:  Everybody's like, we got spaces now though. We got spaces

653
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,980
Speaker 1:  out of it. And

654
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,250
Speaker 4:  Like

655
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,820
Speaker 5:  They thought that, they thought that we were going to be buying brand new

656
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,460
Speaker 5:  electronics and new laptops every six months for

657
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,740
Speaker 4:  The next Yeah. Logitech was like, webcams are back. I was

658
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,520
Speaker 4:  like,

659
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,740
Speaker 5:  You know, I, I'm trying to keep Logitech in business but I can only buy so

660
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:19,700
Speaker 5:  many. Like I have to put them somewhere

661
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,620
Speaker 4:  At some point. Stare directly down the camera. The racing wheel logic

662
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:27,540
Speaker 4:  had bad earnings. This escort. So this is the context, right? They're

663
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:31,420
Speaker 4:  all blaming it on. We thought the pandemic trends would stay where they

664
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:31,540
Speaker 4:  were.

665
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,110
Speaker 1:  How could we know

666
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:36,340
Speaker 4:  It? It seems a little shortsighted.

667
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,320
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like when Liz was writing this piece, she's like, what do you think?

668
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,160
Speaker 4:  I was like the first sentence is they didn't think we would go back outside.

669
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,600
Speaker 4:  And so I like, we can talk about why the laughs are happening and all, all

670
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,040
Speaker 4:  this stuff. But like that's the reason that the tech companies are

671
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,840
Speaker 4:  giving and we talked about it on this show. I've talked about it in decoder,

672
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,720
Speaker 4:  like what are the first order changes of the pandemic? What

673
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,320
Speaker 4:  are the second order changes? Like remote work is a

674
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,640
Speaker 4:  lasting right. Second order change. Like a real

675
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,480
Speaker 4:  thing on, I go on CNBC a lot. All

676
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,360
Speaker 4:  cable news is like, screw it, you can be on Zoom now. They used to be like,

677
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,030
Speaker 4:  you have to come in. Yeah.

678
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:14,640
Speaker 1:  School

679
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,480
Speaker 5:  Has changed. We don't have snow days anymore. I was just talking to my sister

680
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,120
Speaker 5:  about my, my nephew. They had a snow day but it was not a snow day, it was

681
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,720
Speaker 5:  just a

682
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,840
Speaker 4:  Go to school. That's brutal. That should be illegal. I don't, I dunno if

683
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,680
Speaker 4:  there's anyone we can call about

684
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,460
Speaker 1:  That. Little kids unionized right now. Exactly.

685
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:32,440
Speaker 4:  The little kids union. That's great. I

686
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,160
Speaker 4:  mean so there, there's that stuff. But the top line of all these layoffs

687
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,920
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Is we thought it was permanent and that just seems so

688
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,800
Speaker 4:  mistaken. And I think for Google especially, it just rings

689
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,060
Speaker 4:  really hollow to me.

690
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:47,920
Speaker 1:  Yes. Especially when you compare it to Apple who's notably not

691
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,760
Speaker 1:  had layoffs and also didn't grow at nearly

692
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,320
Speaker 1:  the same pace as these other companies. These other companies were doing

693
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,280
Speaker 1:  60, 70% growth year over year for like their

694
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,160
Speaker 1:  staff and Apple was like 10 20%. And so

695
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,120
Speaker 1:  yeah. Now these companies are going, oh we need all that money back. Nevermind.

696
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,600
Speaker 1:  Give

697
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,960
Speaker 4:  It back. Right. And they're, and they're apart from meta, which Mark Zuckerberg

698
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,760
Speaker 4:  said the same thing. We had saw this acceleration pandemic and now we gotta

699
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,290
Speaker 4:  wind it back. Okay. But you know Google, they left their

700
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:19,800
Speaker 4:  AI divisions alone but they shut down their incubator which does all their

701
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,640
Speaker 4:  20% time projects. They're shutting down all these like weird

702
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,330
Speaker 4:  other bets they're doing. They're like health

703
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:30,200
Speaker 4:  science division of alphabet. Like they're trying to refocus

704
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,160
Speaker 4:  on the core of Google. I think a lot of people have learned from

705
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,940
Speaker 4:  Elon like I just get rid of like most of the company

706
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,600
Speaker 4:  and like yeah it'll be a little crappier but

707
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,200
Speaker 1:  Still

708
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,800
Speaker 4:  Gonna do a crash. And, and and we have yet to

709
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,440
Speaker 4:  see. So that's like the big context for Google, right? They just had this

710
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,080
Speaker 4:  like very traumatic event. Yeah. And like maybe the whole tech industry is

711
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,680
Speaker 4:  just copycatting each other. Liz has great quotes in her piece. Like a management

712
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,160
Speaker 4:  professor at Stanford is like, everyone's an idiot.

713
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,360
Speaker 4:  She's like, he's like, it's morons being morons. What do you want for this?

714
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,920
Speaker 4:  It's very good. So but that's a broader context. But then specifically

715
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,040
Speaker 4:  Google, right? You look at all the other companies, Amazon, it's like, oh

716
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,360
Speaker 4:  maybe they built too much warehouse capacity. They're landing people off

717
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,280
Speaker 4:  Microsoft. They're like shut down HoloLens and a bunch of weird surface stuff

718
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,720
Speaker 4:  that people aren't gonna buy. PC shipments are down cuz pandemic is over

719
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,720
Speaker 4:  and everyone already bought their new pc. Still Microsoft. They're gonna

720
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,620
Speaker 4:  be fine. Yeah. Google is like, oh they did all of this. They fired

721
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:28,380
Speaker 4:  12,000 people. The government is suing them. We should talk about this ad

722
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,580
Speaker 4:  tech lawsuit. The second big antitrust lawsuit against Google,

723
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,620
Speaker 4:  which it's adtech

724
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,240
Speaker 1:  Is, we're little biased here, but yeah, we're little

725
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,680
Speaker 4:  By, you know how I feel about the web. That's a big

726
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,400
Speaker 4:  deal. And then they are on the run from

727
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,960
Speaker 4:  chat gt, we talked about this a little bit last week. Yeah. Can you just

728
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,860
Speaker 4:  like add up this week for Google and you're like, oh this is the most

729
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:52,110
Speaker 4:  existential threats a company can face at the same time.

730
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:56,000
Speaker 1:  Yeah. This is, this is way different than like the pixel comes out and

731
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,800
Speaker 1:  does not great numbers. This is, this is their core

732
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,360
Speaker 1:  businesses under attack from many different avenues. And

733
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:07,320
Speaker 1:  like I think the chat G p t Avenue is not actually the, the

734
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,240
Speaker 1:  big existential threat that they feel it is. But the, the stuff going on

735
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:15,110
Speaker 1:  with the DOJ that feels really, really big and important to me. Potentially

736
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:18,850
Speaker 1:  much more so than the chat G P T. But that feels like more of a, a crisis

737
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:20,750
Speaker 1:  of like what are we as a company?

738
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,460
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Richard Roseon

739
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:26,280
Speaker 5:  And all of these things are happening at once and it's just something that

740
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,810
Speaker 5:  we really have never seen for Google. Like since it came on the scene that

741
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:33,640
Speaker 5:  we, that they've had all of this a real comp competitor that maybe they

742
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,300
Speaker 5:  aren't ready for in a, in a space that they aren't ready for. The,

743
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:41,240
Speaker 5:  the pressures of regulators are perhaps higher than they've

744
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,520
Speaker 5:  ever been because everyone has a reason to take, take a hammer to big tech.

745
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,000
Speaker 5:  It's just a way that you can score points as a politician as you've pointed

746
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,960
Speaker 5:  out. Many times Eli and I, I don't know, I, I can't, I

747
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,560
Speaker 5:  can't remember a time since Google has existed that we've seen them on the

748
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,320
Speaker 5:  back foot like

749
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,960
Speaker 4:  This. Yeah. It's tough. And I, you know, my theory about Google is people

750
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,800
Speaker 4:  don't take it seriously cuz it's called Google. Like it's,

751
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,520
Speaker 4:  it's hard to see the company for what it is. Yeah. Because it's called

752
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,010
Speaker 4:  Google and it, you know it very, and for a good reason

753
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:12,760
Speaker 4:  it maintains this image of being like a goofball place for smart people to

754
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,440
Speaker 4:  do smart stuff. Well

755
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,760
Speaker 1:  I worked really hard on that whole do no evil thing, which they've gotten

756
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,230
Speaker 1:  rid of.

757
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:17,960
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's

758
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,240
Speaker 5:  Gone. They had a movie about working, they made a movie about getting

759
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,190
Speaker 4:  Jobs. It was like Owen Wilson

760
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:26,880
Speaker 5:  With real Hollywood stars and it's an advertising company

761
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,760
Speaker 5:  like, and for some reason we don't think of it that

762
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,920
Speaker 4:  Way. Well you what's funny, like big advertising companies, they love to

763
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,600
Speaker 4:  think of themselves as like creative progressive shops and then at the end

764
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,270
Speaker 4:  of the day they're like selling you cigarettes and like fine

765
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:41,040
Speaker 4:  Google is an advertising company but they're like an ad tech company. And

766
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,800
Speaker 4:  so this is where what this lawsuit really gets at is most of what we

767
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,760
Speaker 4:  as consumers experience of Google are the products in particularly the

768
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,600
Speaker 4:  two search and YouTube gmail. Great. And they're good

769
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,160
Speaker 4:  products. People like them. They're the industry leader. It's a very hard

770
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,840
Speaker 4:  to compete with Google search in particular. But the other side of Google,

771
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:02,640
Speaker 4:  the business of Google is as ruthlessly competitive as any

772
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,360
Speaker 4:  company. Yeah. And it's run by advertising executives and salespeople

773
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:10,120
Speaker 4:  and money people. And they are not shy. And

774
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,880
Speaker 4:  so they are not shy about winning whatever competition they're in or

775
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,630
Speaker 4:  foreclosing competition or protecting their monopoly. So you see this lawsuit,

776
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:21,420
Speaker 4:  it's 194 pages long. It's fun to read in the sense that

777
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,320
Speaker 4:  any lawsuit that explains what ad tech is and how it works, could it be

778
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,920
Speaker 4:  fun to, I read it, I recommend you go read the complaint. It's just the complaint.

779
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,040
Speaker 4:  It's a bunch of allegations. But you know, they've obviously done a bunch

780
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,440
Speaker 4:  of discovery. They have have a lot of quotes from executives and what you

781
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,280
Speaker 4:  find is that when you load a webpage, when you load one of

782
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,640
Speaker 4:  our webpages or the Times webpage or any publisher, any website really that

783
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,480
Speaker 4:  has ads on it, there's a whole stack of technology. It's called the

784
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,400
Speaker 4:  Ad tech stack. And there's lots of components and at every layer

785
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,920
Speaker 4:  of the stack, Google owns either the one or two

786
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,440
Speaker 4:  product and they make it so that all those products work

787
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,320
Speaker 4:  better together and they charge more money that Google then skims off at

788
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,910
Speaker 4:  another layer of the stack and they have ruthlessly

789
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:08,840
Speaker 4:  operated this system to basically be the winner. There's no way to compete

790
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,040
Speaker 4:  with him. Yeah. And all this other stuff that Google has done in the past

791
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,920
Speaker 4:  like Google Amp, Google Discu like this, these

792
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,880
Speaker 4:  products that Google makes, they use them to force people back into their

793
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,640
Speaker 4:  advertising ecosystem. The funnel. It's, it's, it's like

794
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,600
Speaker 4:  a ruthless money machine. Yeah. And so if you just like to abstract it,

795
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,760
Speaker 4:  the way to think about it is Apple's a revenue platform that we've complained

796
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:34,440
Speaker 4:  about many times is the iPhone in the app store. Right? Right.

797
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,400
Speaker 4:  And at, at the end of the day, Tim Cook's goal is that every time you push

798
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,120
Speaker 4:  any button on your phone, he gets money. He gets money. And you can just

799
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:46,000
Speaker 4:  see that they ruthlessly optimize for that. And people can argue about

800
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,760
Speaker 4:  whether that's good or that's bad. You can have antitrust lawsuits or laws

801
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,600
Speaker 4:  in Congress or the European scream mad at you. But like that's the goal and

802
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,560
Speaker 4:  you can see how they get there. Yeah. You can see that, you

803
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,060
Speaker 4:  know, Amazon's revenue platform is its store and it's

804
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:03,560
Speaker 4:  AWS business and their goal is to get you to buy everything from Amazon and

805
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:07,400
Speaker 4:  for every app to use AWS to cloud search. Right. You can do this with

806
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,840
Speaker 4:  Microsoft too. You can do this to all these companies. Google's revenue platform

807
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,320
Speaker 4:  is the web. Yeah. And so it's hard to see

808
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:17,070
Speaker 4:  where it begins and ends because you're not,

809
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:21,040
Speaker 4:  it's so ubiquitous. It's just everywhere. It's so you forget, so

810
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,000
Speaker 4:  you forget that all these ads are being served to you by Google in particular

811
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,240
Speaker 4:  by a company Google acquired called DoubleClick and they run this product

812
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,440
Speaker 4:  called DFP DoubleClick for publishers what they change to Google Ads manager

813
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:34,400
Speaker 4:  every still calls dp. And that

814
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,160
Speaker 4:  that thing that they own, the ad server is like

815
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,000
Speaker 4:  hard coded to prefer Google's ad exchanges. It's hard. And that is hard

816
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,480
Speaker 4:  coded to prefer Google's demand side platform. These are all just like ad

817
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,200
Speaker 4:  tech words, whatever. It's just like everywhere you go, the whole chain is

818
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,960
Speaker 4:  Google. And so the government's casing against Google is you

819
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,520
Speaker 4:  bought up all the competitors and every layer of the stack, you used your

820
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,040
Speaker 4:  dominance in one layer of the stack to achieve dominance in another layer

821
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,880
Speaker 4:  of the stack. And now you're charging higher prices, which

822
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,600
Speaker 4:  every other time we talk about antitrust, we're like we gotta change this

823
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,480
Speaker 4:  thing from the consumer welfare theory where there's no higher prices cuz

824
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,880
Speaker 4:  everything's free. Right. Da da we gotta like invent this new a, this is

825
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,647
Speaker 4:  just like old school. Yeah. 1980s. Ronald Reagan,

826
00:44:16,647 --> 00:44:20,500
Speaker 4:  Robert Bork, antitrust. It's like, oh, you bought all this shit

827
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:24,480
Speaker 4:  and now the prices went up. And so like, maybe they got like, you

828
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,520
Speaker 4:  know, usually every time there's a lawsuit Amazon's like, but people love

829
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,440
Speaker 4:  Amazon Prime. Like, you know, Apple's like the app store made

830
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,360
Speaker 4:  everyone happier today.

831
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,840
Speaker 1:  Everybody loves Netflix.

832
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:37,480
Speaker 4:  This is like a bunch of advertisers like you, you robbed us.

833
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,520
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And like Google's Google can be like, people love web

834
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,960
Speaker 4:  advertising. Like they're in a tough spot with this shit.

835
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,880
Speaker 5:  That's a much harder case

836
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,440
Speaker 4:  To make. Yeah. And so like, I just see this as, it's not a novel legal theory.

837
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,200
Speaker 4:  It's not something like Lena Khan invention. Yeah. It's a

838
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,640
Speaker 4:  class. The people who want the lawsuit are the

839
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,360
Speaker 4:  media advertising companies. Other

840
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,760
Speaker 4:  e-commerce companies, like they all see it that, oh, we're losing revenue,

841
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,720
Speaker 4:  we're losing profit margin into Google. There's real money at

842
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,400
Speaker 4:  stake and this is Google's bi. Like this is the

843
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,240
Speaker 4:  money. Yeah. Right. If you, if you uncouple the web from

844
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,410
Speaker 4:  Google, I'm not sure what the web looks like.

845
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:19,450
Speaker 1:  Duck duck go.

846
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:23,260
Speaker 4:  Like if people are doing SEO spam for Duck Duck go like you

847
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:26,370
Speaker 4:  founded like the niches of niche interests.

848
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:27,780
Speaker 1:  You've got three

849
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:31,400
Speaker 4:  Customers. Here's what I do. I cosplay is a specific Victorian Lord

850
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,380
Speaker 4:  and I do SEO for duck.gov. Like what

851
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:35,500
Speaker 4:  are

852
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,900
Speaker 5:  You doing? Like, man, I'm telling you what we're gonna do. We're gonna rebuild

853
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,620
Speaker 5:  Ask G, it's gonna be real people. It's just, it's just gonna be a guy.

854
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:46,380
Speaker 5:  You're just gonna ask a guy, he's gonna, he's gonna tell you something. And

855
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,740
Speaker 5:  similar to ai, it may or may not be true, but you'll

856
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,380
Speaker 4:  Get a, yeah. Chat GBT is just a, a bunch of cost players

857
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,030
Speaker 4:  definitely

858
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:56,420
Speaker 5:  Obvious.

859
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:59,420
Speaker 4:  I mean that's, this to me is like, you just add this up, it's on the one

860
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:02,900
Speaker 4:  hand, and I, I don't think this is true at all, but people will are out

861
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,540
Speaker 4:  there freaking out the stock market by saying chat G P T is gonna replace

862
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:10,460
Speaker 4:  Google. Yeah. And it's like mostly what you experience at chat

863
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:14,100
Speaker 4:  G P T is the good stuff. If you actually sit around trying to use chat d,

864
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:17,480
Speaker 4:  you're like this, this thing is like not very good. Yeah. It's very impressive.

865
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,700
Speaker 4:  But you're seeing it filtered through millions of people only showing you

866
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,660
Speaker 4:  the best stuff

867
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:24,380
Speaker 1:  Resource intensive and expensive to use.

868
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:28,060
Speaker 4:  Yeah. By the way, we got it wrong in the show in classic TikTok strategy.

869
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:31,580
Speaker 4:  We published the thing we said Wrong and that is our most viewed TikTok.

870
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,170
Speaker 4:  Yes.

871
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:35,830
Speaker 1:  That's all for you guys. Misinformation.

872
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:39,820
Speaker 4:  We got, you clicked, didn't you? No, we got it wrong. We

873
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:42,940
Speaker 4:  were getting wrong. It's, it's on Azure. Okay. Microsoft obviously has huge

874
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:46,620
Speaker 4:  investment open eye that just made a bigger investment. It Sam Altman ceo

875
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:49,540
Speaker 4:  Okay. Says it is not very expensive to run now. Oh you to make it cheaper.

876
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:52,940
Speaker 4:  It is not as cheap as Google searches. Right. Per query.

877
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,020
Speaker 1:  It's still like more

878
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:57,390
Speaker 4:  Resources. It's more resource intensive than Google search. But you see Microsoft

879
00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:01,100
Speaker 4:  is like, oh, we don't have to do Bing. We can just answer the questions directly

880
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:04,940
Speaker 4:  with chat. G P T. All right. Maybe that's right. Buzzfeed today

881
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:07,670
Speaker 4:  announced that it's gonna start having chat G P T, right? The quizzes.

882
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:08,700
Speaker 1:  Oh yeah.

883
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,660
Speaker 4:  Mia has done a lot of great reporting on our competitors. Cnet,

884
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:15,500
Speaker 4:  which I have very bittersweet feelings about this. CNET has been the thing

885
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,780
Speaker 4:  that we have competed against.

886
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:17,740
Speaker 1:  They're our enemy

887
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:21,620
Speaker 4:  Since we are founding. Right? Yeah. They're like, we gotta beat cnet. They're

888
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:24,900
Speaker 4:  like the Bastion and they got bought by this private equity company and now

889
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:28,660
Speaker 4:  they're like published SEO spam written by robots cuz they

890
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:32,440
Speaker 4:  are flooding Google to try to win searches and then put ads on those

891
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,360
Speaker 4:  pages. The ads are served by Google.

892
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,280
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Basically they're just chasing Google.

893
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:39,060
Speaker 4:  When I say I don't know what the shape of the web is without Google, it's

894
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:42,760
Speaker 4:  you can, C'S ownership can be like everybody

895
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,520
Speaker 4:  automates their mortgage rate stories. What they have not accounted for is

896
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:50,400
Speaker 4:  why does CNET publish mortgage rate stories? And the answer

897
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,920
Speaker 4:  is cuz they want to win the Google searches. Yeah. So that when you buy a

898
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,240
Speaker 4:  mortgage, you've come through their affiliate link and they get a huge cut

899
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,000
Speaker 4:  of that. Do you know when you sign up for a credit card on like the points

900
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,560
Speaker 4:  Sky is great when you sign up for a credit card, it's all lot of company.

901
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:06,280
Speaker 4:  It's like almost $900 to sign up in an affiliate rank by the way we are gonna

902
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,240
Speaker 4:  start recommending credit cards, the british.com

903
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,340
Speaker 1:  And mortgages sign up with us.

904
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:14,230
Speaker 4:  You just look at that system. Yeah. And you're like, on the one hand,

905
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:18,130
Speaker 4:  people think whether or not it's true that it will be disrupted by

906
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:21,560
Speaker 4:  AI chatbot technology and Microsoft is making that investment and Google

907
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:25,240
Speaker 4:  cannot replace, like regulators around the world will destroy Google.

908
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:29,160
Speaker 4:  If Google stops sending traffic to people, scrapes their data into a language

909
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,840
Speaker 4:  model and then starts answering the questions directly. Yeah. I just, I just

910
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,040
Speaker 4:  don't think that's gonna go well for them.

911
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,720
Speaker 1:  Well I think everybody would just also probably frantically start delisting

912
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,000
Speaker 1:  at being all in on duck dot. Go.

913
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,120
Speaker 4:  That's Alex is the new CEO of Duck dot Go everyone,

914
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,820
Speaker 1:  Please invest directly to me. Vindo.

915
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:50,320
Speaker 4:  And then on the flip side, the AI is being used to flood the search results

916
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,840
Speaker 4:  with garbage. Right? So like, Google's in like a war of

917
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:57,830
Speaker 4:  attrition against SEO spammers who now have an even cheaper way

918
00:48:57,830 --> 00:49:01,720
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Of filling out their content forms. And then the government's

919
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,760
Speaker 4:  like, also your money is evil. And we want to, and oh, I forgot to say this,

920
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,400
Speaker 4:  the government is asking to break up Google's adtech division. They wanna

921
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,050
Speaker 4:  spin off DoubleClick for publishers in atx, which is their exchange.

922
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:15,800
Speaker 4:  So like, just imagine being like sunk,

923
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,680
Speaker 4:  right? You're like, on the one hand, I've gotta kill the cash cow and

924
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:23,600
Speaker 4:  replace it with the technology. We developed our own LLMs Lambda

925
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,640
Speaker 4:  and others. Yeah. Which are superior to Chet, but we haven't released because

926
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,400
Speaker 4:  we have ethical concerns about it. Whoops. But our competitor Microsoft

927
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,780
Speaker 4:  has no such qualms. They're just gonna do it. Meanwhile,

928
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:37,400
Speaker 4:  our cash cow search is being

929
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:41,160
Speaker 4:  turned into a worse product by the same chat G P t

930
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:45,000
Speaker 4:  wielding SEO spammers. Oh. And the government wants to break

931
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:45,390
Speaker 4:  us up.

932
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:49,360
Speaker 1:  It's, and it's all kind of of Google's own making too, right?

933
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:53,280
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Like Google became so dominant. Everybody is chasing to

934
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,840
Speaker 1:  be on Google, seeking the fastest, easiest way to get a tiny

935
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:00,760
Speaker 1:  piece of the pie that Google has made itself. Yeah. So like

936
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,180
Speaker 1:  it's kind of its own fault.

937
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:02,660
Speaker 4:  Yes.

938
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:04,760
Speaker 1:  His success is like what's brought it here, right?

939
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:08,670
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean this is a very smart company. I think Sun's a great ceo.

940
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:11,440
Speaker 4:  I I think he's ruthless when he needs to be and he's kind of needs to be,

941
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,760
Speaker 4:  he's very thoughtful. It's whatever. Like

942
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,680
Speaker 1:  He knows how to make money.

943
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,560
Speaker 4:  We've interviewed him many times. Yeah. He's a very thoughtful and considered

944
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:21,320
Speaker 4:  man. I just am like, his choice is effectively

945
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:25,120
Speaker 4:  alright, it's everyone on the web, it's

946
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:28,960
Speaker 4:  governments around the world. It's the Department of Justice. Who am I

947
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,160
Speaker 4:  gonna piss off? Right? Because like whatever move he

948
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,120
Speaker 4:  makes is going to piss off like two of those entities.

949
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:39,600
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And I just think that is such a difficult place to be. So they're,

950
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:43,000
Speaker 4:  like I said, we, there's reporting out that Google is called a code red about

951
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,430
Speaker 4:  chat. G p D, they do have all this AI technology. They have

952
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:50,280
Speaker 4:  incepted, this meme that Google invented the tea in chat. She p t it

953
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,240
Speaker 4:  stands for transform. It's true. They've demoed it many times. Go back and

954
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,960
Speaker 4:  watch any Google io. Like there's a weird middle segment

955
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,600
Speaker 4:  where sun's like, now I will talk to a fire hydrant as though it's a kitty.

956
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,230
Speaker 4:  And it's like, I know what's going on. But like they, they can do it

957
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:07,160
Speaker 1:  When they had everybody calling, you could just like ask for it to call and

958
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:07,760
Speaker 1:  make a reservation

959
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,240
Speaker 4:  For you. I don't think that's, is that

960
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:09,520
Speaker 1:  Not the same

961
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:13,160
Speaker 4:  Model? Okay. That's, that's a different conversation. They even demoing the,

962
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:17,080
Speaker 4:  the transformer large language models and like, I think the

963
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:20,720
Speaker 4:  last demo was either this past year or the year before, he like asked Pluto

964
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,520
Speaker 4:  if it was a planet. That's right. And Pluto was like kind of sad, you

965
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,720
Speaker 4:  know, I was like, well, here by myself, I don't really know what's going

966
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:31,480
Speaker 4:  on. But what they are demoing is effectively the same technology as chat

967
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,000
Speaker 4:  G p T. So they have it, they are not releasing it because it's,

968
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,800
Speaker 4:  they've thought until now it is unethical to let people

969
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,800
Speaker 4:  talk to a robot that will confidently lie to them.

970
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,680
Speaker 1:  Yes. And it, it is unethical.

971
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,480
Speaker 1:  Microsoft.

972
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:49,080
Speaker 4:  Microsoft is like, whatever man. Like we lost at mobile. We lost on the web,

973
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,280
Speaker 4:  we lost it search. We

974
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,280
Speaker 1:  Do. We're we're gonna do

975
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,590
Speaker 4:  Some check, check out his lion robot. We

976
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:56,540
Speaker 1:  With Bing.

977
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:59,920
Speaker 5:  But that's, that's the issue that they're running in into now. So they're

978
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,200
Speaker 5:  trying to launch all these AI products. They've got there search issues that

979
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,240
Speaker 5:  you've laid out. But something that, that you've talked about a lot when

980
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,040
Speaker 5:  we talked about these antitrust and these these massive tech companies is

981
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,720
Speaker 5:  that every single thing that they launch isn't big enough to really have

982
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,240
Speaker 5:  any impact on their core product and all the money that it makes. So they

983
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,400
Speaker 5:  can have all these, these new AI things. They can, you know, Sundar, he he

984
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,240
Speaker 5:  can, he can do all

985
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,840
Speaker 4:  Of these. They say they're gonna launch 20 new AI products. None

986
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:26,080
Speaker 5:  Of them mattered. None of them will replace what he has. Yeah. New York Times,

987
00:52:26,133 --> 00:52:29,720
Speaker 5:  New York Times described all of these products that they are, are going to

988
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,520
Speaker 5:  try to make, they're doing all the AI things that you've heard of that everyone

989
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,240
Speaker 5:  else is doing. Maybe some that we haven't heard of. We're gonna see 'em all

990
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,140
Speaker 5:  at io. But none of them are bigger than advertising. Yeah.

991
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:41,120
Speaker 4:  And and that's the thing that's under direct threat. And it's under the threat

992
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:45,080
Speaker 4:  threat again in two different No, it's under direct threat in three different

993
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:49,040
Speaker 4:  ways. Right? Yeah. The demand side of it, we talked to this last week,

994
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,880
Speaker 4:  the demand side of it is people might search TikTok or

995
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,760
Speaker 4:  ask Chat G B T or something else instead. Yeah. Or just search Reddit.

996
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,730
Speaker 4:  The people do that all the time. The supply side of it

997
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:03,640
Speaker 4:  is futurism, which is also doing a great job reporting on the c ai

998
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:07,200
Speaker 4:  controversy. They great headline last week. That's like the SEO

999
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,140
Speaker 4:  spammers are thrilled a Google's non-response to CS AI issues. Like,

1000
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:14,760
Speaker 4:  and they're like in the dark web forums and the ISTs spammers are like, light

1001
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:18,360
Speaker 4:  it up boys. Like cuz that is a pure volume game for them,

1002
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,580
Speaker 4:  right? You flood the internet with garbage content. You hope that people,

1003
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:25,440
Speaker 4:  you hope it ranks anywhere. You hope you collect some traffic, you show

1004
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,240
Speaker 4:  some garbage ads and you take your pennies and you just

1005
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:33,120
Speaker 4:  stack pennies until you've made dollars. And if you

1006
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:36,870
Speaker 4:  can make webpages for nothing with an AI product Yeah.

1007
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:37,460
Speaker 1:  Whew.

1008
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:41,250
Speaker 4:  You can stack those pennies pretty fast. Right. And Google just like needs

1009
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:45,050
Speaker 4:  to have an answer to this. And I don't think that they've arrived at one

1010
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:47,690
Speaker 4:  where they're like, we will preserve the quality of Google search without

1011
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:51,610
Speaker 4:  irritating everyone or compete with chat gbt without irritating everyone.

1012
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:55,010
Speaker 4:  And in the middle of it, to Richard's point, the government's like, you know,

1013
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:58,810
Speaker 4:  the machine that makes money that you're trying to fix, what if we took

1014
00:53:58,810 --> 00:54:02,370
Speaker 4:  two-thirds of it away and spun it off into different companies? And I just

1015
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:05,210
Speaker 4:  like, I'm just like looking at this week for Google, I'm like, this is one

1016
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:08,330
Speaker 4:  of the most pivotal weeks for one of like, we talk about the, you know, this

1017
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:12,130
Speaker 4:  set of fan companies like every week we're never like, man, Netflix is having

1018
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:14,890
Speaker 4:  an existential week. We're never, you know, like yeah. We're never like,

1019
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:18,530
Speaker 4:  oh, apple could be five companies tomorrow. Like this is like one of the

1020
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:22,410
Speaker 4:  most consequential existential weeks for Google that I

1021
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:26,250
Speaker 4:  can think of for a big tech company. You a like a long

1022
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:29,850
Speaker 4:  time. We're potentially five years down the line we're looking at this week

1023
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:33,810
Speaker 4:  as like, oh, that was the beginning of a total re-architecting of

1024
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:34,130
Speaker 4:  the web.

1025
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:38,090
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I do wonder, I I, you know, I've been knocking on the chat

1026
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:41,690
Speaker 1:  g p t plan to like compete with a, I wonder how much of that plan though

1027
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:45,570
Speaker 1:  is also to figure out how to combat it and, and the

1028
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:49,130
Speaker 1:  spam it creates on Google. Cuz like, if you go and you create a new

1029
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:51,930
Speaker 1:  competitor for it and figure out all the inner workings, you theoretically

1030
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:54,850
Speaker 1:  could like figure out how to highlight it and spot it.

1031
00:54:54,850 --> 00:54:58,840
Speaker 4:  I think Casey and platform are spotlighted some of this where he is like

1032
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,730
Speaker 4:  Google does have AI detection systems. It

1033
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:06,290
Speaker 4:  can, because it knows the training data sets, it knows what it looks like

1034
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:09,890
Speaker 4:  on the other side. And there's this concept of like radioactive data

1035
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:13,410
Speaker 4:  where you seed the models with some stuff where you know what

1036
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:16,410
Speaker 4:  outputs it will generate and you can detect it even better. We'll see, I,

1037
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:18,050
Speaker 4:  I think we're in the middle of an arm's race for

1038
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:19,850
Speaker 1:  Google. I love it.

1039
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:22,290
Speaker 4:  12,000. It's the first time the company's ever had layoffs of the

1040
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:23,920
Speaker 1:  Scale. Nevermind. I don't love it.

1041
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,170
Speaker 4:  I think it's gonna be weird. All right. We gotta take a break. When come

1042
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:29,210
Speaker 4:  back. We talk about Tesla learnings a little lightning round. Some Microsoft

1043
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:29,890
Speaker 4:  in there where we

1044
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:35,340
Speaker 4:  at.

1045
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:10,710
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back. I don't know why I thought we could get through Tesla

1046
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:12,110
Speaker 4:  and a lightning round in the last segment

1047
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:14,870
Speaker 1:  Here. I believe in us, we're gonna go really fast. We're just gonna accelerate

1048
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:16,560
Speaker 1:  it. Listen to us at three x

1049
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,720
Speaker 4:  So we're gonna talk fast and to listen to us at three x,

1050
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:23,700
Speaker 1:  Do a line of coke first. Don't do a line of Coke.

1051
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,430
Speaker 1:  This is not an endorsement of cocaine.

1052
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:28,220
Speaker 1:  Sorry.

1053
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:31,110
Speaker 5:  I heard specifically I was

1054
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:35,080
Speaker 5:  told by an executive

1055
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:38,910
Speaker 5:  at this company that I had a a job to

1056
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:42,540
Speaker 5:  do and what else can I do?

1057
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:45,830
Speaker 4:  What's the job doing cocaine.

1058
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:47,010
Speaker 1:  Which exec?

1059
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:50,030
Speaker 5:  All right, it's fun. Was that, was that not, was that not, was that not in

1060
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,570
Speaker 5:  your public contract? Because

1061
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:54,140
Speaker 4:  Our start, our startup days are very

1062
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:55,190
Speaker 5:  Negotiated.

1063
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:56,980
Speaker 4:  There was a time,

1064
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:57,550
Speaker 1:  Yeah,

1065
00:58:57,550 --> 00:59:00,150
Speaker 4:  Again, that this was the time when we were doing the video

1066
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:03,990
Speaker 4:  vergecast the last time, like I said,

1067
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:07,650
Speaker 4:  karmic debt. We are just immediately running up the bill again. Just

1068
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:11,320
Speaker 4:  you turn the cameras on, Alex is like, here's what you should do. Kids

1069
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,050
Speaker 1:  Go on.

1070
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:16,950
Speaker 4:  All right. We do have to get through this. Please just don't tell

1071
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:17,990
Speaker 4:  your parents about that.

1072
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:20,390
Speaker 1:  Yeah, don't do that. It's

1073
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:24,360
Speaker 4:  Bad. Just don't let him know any of that happened. All right. Lots

1074
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:28,000
Speaker 4:  of Tesla, Tesla earnings. Elon's on trial for

1075
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,080
Speaker 4:  the four 20, for

1076
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,790
Speaker 1:  The four 20 tweet. Finally back.

1077
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:36,480
Speaker 4:  He's very upset about being on trial. Yeah. He's attacked

1078
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,220
Speaker 4:  the, the plaintiff's, he's attacked the plaintiff's lawyer several times.

1079
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:44,160
Speaker 4:  Oof. The, it's a class action. It's a group

1080
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,840
Speaker 4:  of investors who feel that they lost money because Elon

1081
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:51,520
Speaker 4:  tweeted taking Tesla private at four 20 as share funding secured,

1082
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,440
Speaker 1:  Which was a thing that the s e C was also like. No.

1083
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,890
Speaker 4:  Yeah. The judge has instructed the jury in this case

1084
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:01,520
Speaker 4:  to proceed knowing the tweet was a

1085
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:05,480
Speaker 4:  lie. So like Elon's on his back foot and so he is in

1086
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:09,400
Speaker 4:  the courtroom. He is taken the stand. We've been covering it, but he's

1087
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,960
Speaker 4:  basically said to the plaintiff's lawyer like, you don't represent my actual

1088
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,920
Speaker 4:  investors. Yeah, you're just, you're just like a vulture. Which is very funny.

1089
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:20,320
Speaker 4:  The judge got mad at him. He said that

1090
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:23,800
Speaker 4:  he knows that he's popular because he has so many Twitter

1091
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:27,760
Speaker 4:  followers. Oh, buddy, that's tough. That's a tough one. Who

1092
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,520
Speaker 4:  just, I would say he's complained of back pain. Yeah. So just a very

1093
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,130
Speaker 4:  rough week.

1094
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:36,040
Speaker 1:  He did say the four 20 tweet was not about anything

1095
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,170
Speaker 1:  in particular as well.

1096
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:40,000
Speaker 4:  Oh, he said it was not, he said it wasn't a weed joke. He said it was a real

1097
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,320
Speaker 4:  number that was a 20% premium over the share price.

1098
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:47,080
Speaker 4:  Sure. For which again, he was castigated by the judge because the judge was

1099
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:50,840
Speaker 4:  like, but the treat was a lie. It's a lot. So he's been on the stand. There's

1100
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:54,800
Speaker 4:  a lot of coverage there. Obviously that trial is mostly mechanical about

1101
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:58,680
Speaker 4:  injury to these shareholders. But Elon's on witness stand,

1102
01:00:58,680 --> 01:00:59,480
Speaker 4:  we're not gonna not

1103
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:01,080
Speaker 1:  Cover it. We're gonna, we're gonna watch it.

1104
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:04,720
Speaker 4:  So that's happening At the same time. Tesla had earnings. Richard earnings

1105
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,010
Speaker 4:  did pretty well.

1106
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:09,990
Speaker 5:  They actually made more money in 2022 than they ever did before. Yeah, yeah.

1107
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:13,900
Speaker 5:  So it, it's amazing the way that we talk about the chaos, the way

1108
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:17,660
Speaker 5:  that his focus on Twitter may have taken away from Tesla or, or any number

1109
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:21,180
Speaker 5:  of other things. Tesla is still making money. They are still making more

1110
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:24,900
Speaker 5:  cars than they, than they did before. They are relying less on those

1111
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:28,420
Speaker 5:  credits that they sell to other companies for revenue. They are acting like

1112
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:32,330
Speaker 5:  an actual car company. Amazing building vehicles that people buy.

1113
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:36,150
Speaker 5:  They showed off the semifinal, the cyber truck will arrive.

1114
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:39,980
Speaker 4:  So, so they, they pushed 2024. They pushed the cyber truck. Yeah.

1115
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:43,300
Speaker 4:  They said, you know, the factory construction's underway. This is on the

1116
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:47,020
Speaker 4:  earnings call. No update on the windshield wiper

1117
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:50,820
Speaker 4:  situation. Zero. I swear to God they're still working on the cyber trucks

1118
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:52,010
Speaker 1:  Wipe. That's what told to get back.

1119
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:54,700
Speaker 4:  It's three wipers in a circle. I will accept no other

1120
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:56,330
Speaker 4:  answer.

1121
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:57,820
Speaker 1:  Just gonna get super high. They

1122
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:01,420
Speaker 4:  Have, they have not solved this problem. Yeah. I guarantee you they have

1123
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:05,060
Speaker 4:  not solved this problem. It's, it's the, it's amazing. But cyber

1124
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:08,740
Speaker 4:  truck's still vaporware, but they lowered the price of the three and the

1125
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:10,730
Speaker 4:  y sales skyrocketed.

1126
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:13,620
Speaker 5:  They say they have a new platform coming that they're going to show at their

1127
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:15,660
Speaker 5:  investor day. So they're, they're

1128
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:19,240
Speaker 4:  Stuff, yeah. So Tesla's moving, obviously he got some questions, questions

1129
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:23,040
Speaker 4:  about Twitter. He again said that he

1130
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:26,960
Speaker 4:  didn't think Twitter was a distraction. Woo. That it's a good marketing channel

1131
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,800
Speaker 4:  for Tesla. Look at my followers. Yeah. I don't know

1132
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:34,350
Speaker 4:  man. At the same time, Twitter has run

1133
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:38,200
Speaker 4:  just face first into what I might

1134
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:41,040
Speaker 4:  be so bold is to call a predictable welcome to hell

1135
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:44,880
Speaker 4:  situation in which the government of India,

1136
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,620
Speaker 4:  the, the MOI administration in India is very upset about a

1137
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:52,360
Speaker 4:  BBC documentary that looks at riots instead of Gora

1138
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:56,200
Speaker 4:  Hindu versus Muslim riots. They're very, very bad and basically places

1139
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,960
Speaker 4:  a lot of the blame for these riots with the current prime minister of Indian

1140
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:03,840
Speaker 4:  Miranda Modi. This is like not a surprise to anyone that

1141
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,770
Speaker 4:  like he was an inciting factor in these riots or that he,

1142
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:11,320
Speaker 4:  he allowed it to happen. Like he's a handy nationalist. That's what this

1143
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:14,800
Speaker 4:  party has done for this happened in 2014. Yeah. This has been the accusation

1144
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:18,360
Speaker 4:  all along. BBC just made a documentary about it. If you weren't interested

1145
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:21,750
Speaker 4:  in such thing, you should have watched the ary Government of India has

1146
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:25,710
Speaker 4:  strict censorship laws like super strict censorship laws.

1147
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:29,400
Speaker 4:  They require social media companies to have national

1148
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:33,280
Speaker 4:  offices staffed by locals so that they can threaten to arrest

1149
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,920
Speaker 4:  those locals if you do not comply with their censorship laws.

1150
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,340
Speaker 1:  Well, I don't wanna work.

1151
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:40,840
Speaker 4:  You do not want, yeah. This is like, and this is like one of those things

1152
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:44,600
Speaker 4:  where you can claim to be a free speech warrior. You are going to end

1153
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:48,300
Speaker 4:  up asking yourself if you would like to do business in India,

1154
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:52,240
Speaker 4:  one of the largest countries in the world. And if you do want to

1155
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:55,720
Speaker 4:  do business in India, you have to staff an office full of potential

1156
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:59,440
Speaker 4:  hostages for the Indian government to take if you do not comply with their

1157
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,240
Speaker 4:  censorship demands. Ooh, real problem. Yeah. So India sees this

1158
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:06,920
Speaker 4:  documentary again, produced by the bbc, have many opinions about the bbc,

1159
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:10,040
Speaker 4:  but you know, they at least attempt to be journalistically rigorous. It says

1160
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:13,200
Speaker 4:  a thing that people have been saying for a long time. They hate it. Right.

1161
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,120
Speaker 4:  This attacks the government of India. This is not respectful of whatever

1162
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:18,720
Speaker 4:  the justification, take it down. YouTube,

1163
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:22,640
Speaker 4:  Twitter, internet archive, remove your links to

1164
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:26,360
Speaker 4:  this thing. So YouTube caves, which is

1165
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:30,200
Speaker 4:  unsurprising, right? For YouTube. They have the office there,

1166
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:34,180
Speaker 4:  they do it. This is their stance, right? This like tight rope balancing

1167
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:37,840
Speaker 4:  act that all the big platforms have done. Where do we comply? Where do we

1168
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,920
Speaker 4:  stand up for users? All right, we're taking this one out. We're not serving

1169
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,600
Speaker 4:  in an India, you can get it here, but in India you don't get see it. By the

1170
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:47,080
Speaker 4:  way, Indian YouTube flooded with Indians talking about the video that was

1171
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:49,230
Speaker 4:  removed. Did this work? Who knows

1172
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:51,400
Speaker 1:  VPNs exist.

1173
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:55,120
Speaker 4:  Strat Effect was this a, does this, does censorship work on the internet?

1174
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:57,800
Speaker 4:  Who knows? Yeah. That's what, that's what YouTube does. And on balance, right?

1175
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:01,280
Speaker 4:  YouTube is like, they have a lot of lawyers, you have a lot of Google policy

1176
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:05,080
Speaker 4:  people were like actively arguing set. Twitter just takes down and it's like,

1177
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:09,040
Speaker 4:  does Twitter have a policy team anymore? Do they know that the government

1178
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:12,400
Speaker 4:  ideas removing links to a BBC documentary, do they know that their

1179
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:16,240
Speaker 4:  owner is like Elon Musk who's like, I believe in free speech. I'm a,

1180
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:20,200
Speaker 4:  I'm a free speech absolutist. I don't know. People ask Elon

1181
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,530
Speaker 4:  about it. He's like, I can't keep on top of everything all the time.

1182
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:24,390
Speaker 1:  No,

1183
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:28,190
Speaker 4:  I mean, I mean this is it, right? If like you are against government censorship.

1184
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:29,080
Speaker 1:  Yeah.

1185
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:31,030
Speaker 4:  These are the fights that you are going to have.

1186
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:34,520
Speaker 1:  Like this is a core fight for someone who says they are very much against

1187
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,240
Speaker 1:  government censorship.

1188
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:39,030
Speaker 4:  So Eddie Peace, you should read it. Her point is, Elon has always said,

1189
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:41,880
Speaker 4:  I don't think companies should censor. If the people want things censored,

1190
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:45,720
Speaker 4:  they should pass a law. So that is just open support

1191
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:48,880
Speaker 4:  of government censorship. Yep. I don't think the people of India have voted

1192
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,760
Speaker 4:  on a law remove this documentary, but that's where we're at is this

1193
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:56,610
Speaker 4:  extremely fine tight rope walk

1194
01:05:56,610 --> 01:06:00,600
Speaker 4:  of what it actually means to support free speech against the actual threat

1195
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:04,480
Speaker 4:  to free speech, which is government censorship. Yeah. And I, I

1196
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:08,400
Speaker 4:  think Elon, I think he's like back on the Tesla SpaceX trip. He's over the

1197
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,240
Speaker 4:  Twitter adventure and it's just gonna get worse. Richard, do you wanna

1198
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,480
Speaker 4:  say something?

1199
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:16,800
Speaker 5:  Well, I just wanted to know, you know, if, if you support free speech, if

1200
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:20,440
Speaker 5:  anyone does support free speech, why didn't they spend 44 billion on a social

1201
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:24,240
Speaker 5:  network that no one wanted about? That's, that's just what a real

1202
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,920
Speaker 5:  free speech supporter would've done. Like Elon Musk who

1203
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:31,840
Speaker 5:  does support free speech for people who have 44 billion and

1204
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:34,390
Speaker 5:  don't piss off the government's in countries that they wanted to visit. Yeah.

1205
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:37,840
Speaker 4:  I mean, again, I think that I should be made king of Twitter, Elon Phil

1206
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:41,510
Speaker 4:  listening. I'll do it. It'll be, it'll be expensive.

1207
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:45,120
Speaker 4:  Yeah. That's the title that I demand. I like it. King of Twitter. It'll be

1208
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,000
Speaker 4:  spendy. Yeah. Giant

1209
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,520
Speaker 1:  Cheap. Oh no, they're not public. I was gonna be like, do you go to earnings

1210
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,400
Speaker 1:  calls? But you wouldn't have to because you're the king of Twitter.

1211
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:54,600
Speaker 4:  There's one earnings call you have to go to and it will be extremely

1212
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:58,320
Speaker 4:  annoying audience of

1213
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:02,160
Speaker 4:  one. We'll see, I'm just saying like Tesla's back

1214
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:05,840
Speaker 4:  on track, they need new cars. They're facing an

1215
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:09,160
Speaker 4:  onslaught of competition this year. Most of those cars are still vaporware.

1216
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:13,010
Speaker 4:  Like can you get an F-150 Lightning? No, you cannot. No. Can you get a Rivian?

1217
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:13,880
Speaker 4:  No, you cannot. Can

1218
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:15,320
Speaker 1:  You get a cyber truck?

1219
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:19,230
Speaker 4:  Fair enough. No. Can you get a Cadillac lyric? No you cannot.

1220
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:23,160
Speaker 4:  Like the competition is coming as a, as a drum that has

1221
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:27,080
Speaker 4:  been beaten but the cars are not shipping. Yeah. Once

1222
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:30,880
Speaker 4:  they start shipping, once the ad dollars flow through Google's

1223
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,720
Speaker 4:  ecosystem, I think Tesla is gonna have to

1224
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:38,640
Speaker 4:  like figure out what to do. But what they know they can do right now is

1225
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:42,550
Speaker 4:  there's got a lower prices. Yeah. People are just gonna show up. And

1226
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:45,360
Speaker 4:  I think I'm excited for actual competition in the EV market. I think that'll

1227
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:49,320
Speaker 4:  be good. But the moment Elon has to turn his attention back

1228
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:53,080
Speaker 4:  to governments around the world want to censor Twitter and

1229
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,240
Speaker 4:  it's like, what do you thinks a powder keg

1230
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,800
Speaker 1:  Wants? Because he doesn't wanna really turn there. He's already said if you

1231
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:02,360
Speaker 1:  make a law and, and we we're just gonna abide by that law. So if the government

1232
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:04,120
Speaker 1:  comes to us and says take it down, we're gonna take it down.

1233
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:07,940
Speaker 4:  Except, but if the United States government does that, he gets real mad because

1234
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:09,360
Speaker 1:  The First Amendment, he

1235
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,040
Speaker 4:  Doesn't care about that.

1236
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:13,760
Speaker 1:  I know, that's what I'm saying is like he's got that so he doesn't wanna

1237
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,150
Speaker 1:  take anything down in America. Right?

1238
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:18,600
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I dunno. But he wants to make it the safest place in the world for

1239
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,480
Speaker 4:  advertisers. Like he, it's,

1240
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,630
Speaker 1:  It's, yeah, he,

1241
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:23,480
Speaker 4:  When I say this is a welcome to hell problem, this is like

1242
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:24,280
Speaker 1:  None of it makes sense.

1243
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:27,440
Speaker 4:  The other social networks, you know that Financial Times set up a massives.

1244
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:30,320
Speaker 4:  Everyone wants us to set up a massive incense. By the way, thank you to the

1245
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:33,840
Speaker 4:  one VER has listener who just went off and did it. Yes. And like

1246
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:37,800
Speaker 4:  beat our own teams to study up a NASA instance with activity pub

1247
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:40,980
Speaker 4:  with Hatch, which has quick posts in it. Like very good.

1248
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:44,760
Speaker 4:  Congratulations. Potentially an IP issue. But for

1249
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:48,000
Speaker 4:  now I've just, I'm overlooking it. It's great. I love it. Thank you so

1250
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:48,920
Speaker 4:  much.

1251
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:52,100
Speaker 1:  Really excited for you to talk about that in the court case in six months.

1252
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:52,530
Speaker 1:  Yes.

1253
01:08:52,530 --> 01:08:56,480
Speaker 4:  If, if this is opposing counsel's attorney, I didn't

1254
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:59,360
Speaker 4:  mean it. I'm not Neil a Patel. This is a deep fake, you can tell because

1255
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:02,000
Speaker 4:  I'm looking directly into the camera.

1256
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,560
Speaker 4:  Hmm. I'm not me

1257
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:08,320
Speaker 4:  right now. A deep fake is saying this in Spanish. Who knows what's

1258
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:12,280
Speaker 4:  happening. The financial time set up a mask on server. Do you

1259
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:15,080
Speaker 4:  see this? Yeah. They took it down. They're like, this is too

1260
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,120
Speaker 1:  Hard. No, it's too much.

1261
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:19,810
Speaker 4:  They're like the escalating legal server costs are too much.

1262
01:09:19,810 --> 01:09:21,280
Speaker 4:  We don't want to do this anymore.

1263
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:24,760
Speaker 1:  You said server costs, you have to be like, oh I can now see everyone's dms.

1264
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:28,520
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like we don't, we don't want this in our lives. Very good. Microsoft

1265
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:30,420
Speaker 4:  outside earnings. What's going on Microsoft?

1266
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:34,240
Speaker 1:  Not, not good. Good news. Pretty bad news at

1267
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:35,160
Speaker 1:  Microsoft. And

1268
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,550
Speaker 4:  Can I use it Intel too?

1269
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:40,480
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I think there is a theme here, which is that everybody bought their

1270
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:44,240
Speaker 1:  laptops and computers in 2020 and 2021 and they didn't buy any in

1271
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:47,770
Speaker 1:  2022, especially at the end of the year.

1272
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:51,760
Speaker 1:  So Microsoft's earnings were really down across all hardware. So that means

1273
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:55,640
Speaker 1:  Windows, the OEMs, they're not selling enough to the OEMs cuz the

1274
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:59,600
Speaker 1:  OEMs aren't selling enough laptops. They're not selling

1275
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:03,160
Speaker 1:  surfaces cuz nobody wants to buy them. They're not selling

1276
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:07,040
Speaker 1:  boxes. Which was kind of an interesting one. Their, their cloud's

1277
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:10,360
Speaker 1:  holding strong. Azure is, is doing great. That's where they're putting a

1278
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:13,280
Speaker 1:  lot of their investments. And I think we saw also with their layoffs, their

1279
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:16,360
Speaker 1:  layoffs really particularly hit hard. A lot of those hardware divisions,

1280
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:20,260
Speaker 1:  a lot of those places that are based in you owning the device

1281
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:23,880
Speaker 1:  and using all of it. So if you like

1282
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:24,830
Speaker 1:  that,

1283
01:10:24,830 --> 01:10:26,800
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Microsoft's turning away from

1284
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,200
Speaker 1:  You. They don't care about you. I mean they probably still care about you.

1285
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:30,560
Speaker 1:  They still have the business. They're not gonna get

1286
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,960
Speaker 4:  Rid of this. They're gonna put edge icons in your desktop to try to get you

1287
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,080
Speaker 4:  into some Microsoft services.

1288
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:38,040
Speaker 1:  Yeah. But it was, it was not good times for Microsoft. And we saw

1289
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:41,720
Speaker 1:  the same thing with Intel. Intel. Again, they're stuffed down. Chips are

1290
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:44,560
Speaker 1:  down because nobody is buying the laptops to put the chips in. So none of

1291
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,200
Speaker 1:  the laptop bakers are buying the chips. And the GPU business is real

1292
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,980
Speaker 1:  down. To be fair, there's only like one GPU

1293
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:55,600
Speaker 1:  too. There's not that many Gs at Intel. So this is not a

1294
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,400
Speaker 1:  shock. Intel is also anticipating a 40% drop

1295
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:03,280
Speaker 1:  year over year. Next quarter. Not good. Not

1296
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:07,080
Speaker 1:  good. So Intel is in trouble. They knew they were in trouble. They, they

1297
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:10,280
Speaker 1:  they've been anticipating this unlike a lot of the other companies. They

1298
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:12,960
Speaker 1:  still miss a lot of their forecasts, right? Yeah. They, they didn't hit any

1299
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:16,360
Speaker 1:  of, of their marks, but they also were like, it's not gonna be good. And

1300
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:19,200
Speaker 1:  it wasn't good And they're like, it's gonna be even worse and it's gonna

1301
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:22,680
Speaker 1:  be even worse. And I think they're really looking towards when they get these

1302
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:26,040
Speaker 1:  fabs up in what, 2024 I think is when the first one's supposed to come online

1303
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:30,000
Speaker 1:  in Ohio. Yeah. So they're like them in the in in Tesla. They're

1304
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,160
Speaker 1:  like, just, just wait. So worry about 2027.

1305
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:34,960
Speaker 4:  We're gonna back the cyber truck right up to our new fab. It's gonna be great.

1306
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,760
Speaker 4:  Roll out some three nanometer chips. Send directly to amd.

1307
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:42,160
Speaker 4:  We'll see, I mean, again, the, the theme of these sec layouts and you really

1308
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:44,880
Speaker 4:  should read Liz's piece. All of them are like, we just thought the pandemic

1309
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,880
Speaker 4:  would last forever. Yeah. We just thought people would buy a new laptop every

1310
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,520
Speaker 4:  year. And it's like when why did you think that? It's like, it's like the

1311
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:55,160
Speaker 4:  best example I can give is like the whole TV industry thought 3D TV would

1312
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:58,320
Speaker 4:  work and last forever. Yes. And it's like guys,

1313

1334
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:53,820
Speaker 4:  Should we do a Vergecast?

1335
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:54,240
Speaker 1:  Yes.

1336
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:55,180
Speaker 4:  With an ice stream?

1337
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:56,440
Speaker 1:  I'm real bad at it. It's gonna be

1338
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:59,680
Speaker 4:  Great. Whenever, whenever David comes back from his break, he had a baby.

1339
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:01,810
Speaker 4:  He's, he's on break. You should take care of the baby.

1340
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:05,640
Speaker 1:  No, we're just giving him time all but David can't have all this

1341
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:06,670
Speaker 1:  time to practice.

1342
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:08,360
Speaker 4:  He's got a baby. He's not practicing.

1343
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:11,200
Speaker 1:  He's practicing with like one hand. He's holding that baby. He's got him

1344
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,280
Speaker 1:  in the little pom. It's great.

1345
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:16,170
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Okay. I mean, you know, there's, there's four of us, of us. Yeah. We're

1346
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:19,480
Speaker 4:  by the way, it has local split screen multiplayer, which is like what I really

1347
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:23,200
Speaker 4:  want. Perfect. It's gonna be great. Very excited about that. TikTok has

1348
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:27,080
Speaker 4:  confirmed now after reporting in Forbes that I can just

1349
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:28,400
Speaker 4:  make videos go viral whenever it won.

1350
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,590
Speaker 1:  Shock. I'm just shocked by this news.

1351
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:33,360
Speaker 4:  Back in the Facebook video era, we would joke that Mark Zuckerberg just had

1352
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,680
Speaker 4:  a knob and you just like, turn it up. TikTok s Yeah we bought, we have that

1353
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:39,030
Speaker 4:  knob and you can pay us to turn it whenever you want.

1354
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:41,110
Speaker 5:  Just press the button. Just press the button.

1355
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:44,360
Speaker 4:  I feel like the TikTok balloon is gonna pop that story in Forbes.

1356
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:48,200
Speaker 1:  That's why the one video that really pops for us is

1357
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,670
Speaker 1:  they're like, oh, ver got it wrong.

1358
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:50,640
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1359
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:51,470
Speaker 1:  Crank it.

1360
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:55,000
Speaker 5:  I feel certain that TikTok is not actually an AI feed. It's just

1361
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,920
Speaker 5:  That's that's the one that's It's just some dude

1362
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:58,320
Speaker 1:  That's all

1363
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,680
Speaker 5:  It's, there's like 25

1364
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:00,280
Speaker 4:  Players. You could

1365
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:04,040
Speaker 5:  Be on one. There's just some Dude Casey case III is back

1366
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:07,880
Speaker 5:  there dropping videos in the playlists and that's all it is. And we're gonna

1367
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,080
Speaker 5:  find out that all this time there was no

1368
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:13,440
Speaker 4:  Ai. I'm very excited for that. Go read that story. It's actually really interesting

1369
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:17,200
Speaker 4:  cause TikTok is so embedded in the music industry. There's just a lot of

1370
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:20,480
Speaker 4:  pay to play to break a song on TikTok right now, which is fascinating. And

1371
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,910
Speaker 4:  then we gotta, we gotta end here Alex. It's a downer.

1372
01:14:22,910 --> 01:14:23,620
Speaker 1:  Yeah,

1373
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:27,130
Speaker 4:  But it's the Verge. We have sand with Peacock,

1374
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:30,880
Speaker 4:  Comcast head earnings. Comcast as you

1375
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:34,320
Speaker 4:  know, N B C U division. Minority investor in V Media, the versus parent

1376
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:37,240
Speaker 4:  company. There's your disclosure. That was good. What's going on with

1377
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:40,860
Speaker 1:  Peacock? So peacock. It's, it's

1378
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:44,720
Speaker 1:  not doing great. I truly believe that poker face is gonna

1379
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:48,000
Speaker 1:  save it. Yeah. If you watch the show with Natasha Leon, I

1380
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,290
Speaker 4:  Almost, it's not out yet.

1381
01:14:49,290 --> 01:14:50,120
Speaker 1:  It just came

1382
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,200
Speaker 4:  Out. It's out today.

1383
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:54,840
Speaker 1:  It's out today. Some of us got to watch a little bit of it early. Oh I see.

1384
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,010
Speaker 1:  I swear I didn't watch. Some of us are in the right

1385
01:14:57,010 --> 01:15:00,010
Speaker 4:  Eastern good screeners. This is what I just learned.

1386
01:15:00,010 --> 01:15:04,000
Speaker 1:  It was great. Highly, highly recommend it. But yeah, they, they,

1387
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,600
Speaker 1:  Comcast overall NBCUniversal overall did face big losses.

1388
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,400
Speaker 1:  Peacock just recently surpassed a really big number for them.

1389
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,893
Speaker 1:  Guess how many subscribers? Six 20 million.

1390
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:15,430
Speaker 4:  Hey, that's pretty good.

1391
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:19,290
Speaker 1:  Yeah, that's is it? What is it a 10th

1392
01:15:19,290 --> 01:15:20,250
Speaker 1:  of what Netflix

1393
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:22,710
Speaker 4:  Is doing? I was just saying it's more subscribers than I have.

1394
01:15:22,710 --> 01:15:23,920
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Like

1395
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:27,760
Speaker 4:  Subscribe to my CK everyone. I don't, I don't have

1396
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,790
Speaker 4:  one of those. I didn't even have a Twitter anymore. What am I doing?

1397
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:33,640
Speaker 1:  Yeah, so, so it's, it's taking losses and it's a loss

1398
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:37,520
Speaker 1:  on the Comcast balance sheet. I think we've always said in the go 90 scale

1399
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:41,280
Speaker 1:  where the zero means they're alive and the 90 means they're,

1400
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:44,900
Speaker 1:  they're boot doomed. This is now like a 70 to 80.

1401
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:46,510
Speaker 4:  Wow. You're gonna always 70 80.

1402
01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:50,220
Speaker 1:  I I think so. I think Peacock probably has the best chance of being

1403
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:54,120
Speaker 1:  the first big broadcast streamer that goes actually this is not

1404
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:56,800
Speaker 1:  for us. And they sell. I don't know what they're gonna do though because

1405
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,160
Speaker 5:  Alright, are you sure they'll do that? Or that they'll try and buy some other

1406
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:00,840
Speaker 5:  streamer that is

1407
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:04,240
Speaker 1:  Also cool. They're not gonna buy Paramount. Cuz Paramount has been like in

1408
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:07,240
Speaker 1:  this, we're doing it by ourselves thing before anybody else did.

1409
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:10,920
Speaker 4:  And and they have the Yellowstone verse.

1410
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:14,880
Speaker 1:  Yeah, they got the, they got the 23. Oh my God.

1411
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,080
Speaker 1:  1923 is so good. You

1412
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:19,160
Speaker 4:  Know what, every single year of American history people in Montana have shot

1413
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,160
Speaker 1:  Each other with Tommy

1414
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:23,230
Speaker 1:  Gun.

1415
01:16:23,230 --> 01:16:27,000
Speaker 4:  That show, we have been watching that show It's Yellowstone. Yellowstone

1416
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:27,200
Speaker 4:  proper.

1417
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:28,190
Speaker 1:  The, yeah,

1418
01:16:28,190 --> 01:16:32,120
Speaker 4:  Okay. The conceit. I dunno, this is crazy talking about Ro chest. It's just,

1419
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:35,720
Speaker 4:  if you think about that show is having the lawyer's

1420
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:39,680
Speaker 4:  son, the business daughter and then the Call of Duty son.

1421
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:42,680
Speaker 4:  It just like locks into place. You're like, all right, we need to have a

1422
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:46,120
Speaker 4:  Call of Duty cut seat in the middle of this episode. And it's just always

1423
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:47,750
Speaker 4:  happens.

1424
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:51,630
Speaker 1:  It's so like the most compelling thing. Is it good tv?

1425
01:16:51,630 --> 01:16:51,920
Speaker 1:  I

1426
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:53,520
Speaker 4:  Don't know. Yeah. I mean we've been watching. It's very

1427
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:54,020
Speaker 1:  Entertaining.

1428
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:56,730
Speaker 4:  But yeah, there's like, oh the cut scene is here

1429
01:16:56,730 --> 01:16:59,910
Speaker 1:  Despite my Yeah, look at it. They're on horses.

1430
01:16:59,910 --> 01:17:03,240
Speaker 4:  They introduce characters just for the Call of Duty son to murder

1431
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:06,760
Speaker 4:  them. It's like very, you're like, oh, that motherfucker's gonna die. But

1432
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:09,450
Speaker 1:  He's sad about it. He's sad about it. He feels, he feels, feels grief.

1433
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:12,790
Speaker 4:  No, I think actually by season four he is like, this is what I do.

1434
01:17:12,790 --> 01:17:13,560
Speaker 1:  I just kill.

1435
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:16,360
Speaker 4:  Anyway, but that's Peacock had, that's what Peacock had going for. Yeah.

1436
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:17,760
Speaker 4:  Peacock. Peacock And the first four Seasons,

1437
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:18,440
Speaker 1:  It's got the first four

1438
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,040
Speaker 4:  Seasons and now it's Paramount Plus.

1439
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:23,920
Speaker 1:  Paramount Plus has all of the adjacent shows. So it's got the, the fancy

1440
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:27,490
Speaker 1:  one with Harrison Ford. It's got the Sylvester Stallone one where

1441
01:17:27,490 --> 01:17:29,840
Speaker 1:  he goes to Oklahoma to start a

1442
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:33,760
Speaker 1:  mob. It's him and like Martin

1443
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:36,480
Speaker 1:  Starr just out there mobing

1444
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,840
Speaker 4:  Up. That's I'll take it. I love it. It's great. I wanna watch 'em all. See

1445
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:41,160
Speaker 4:  that's, that's why Peacock won Pie Paramount

1446
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:43,080
Speaker 1:  Plus. Yeah. They, they, they can't afford it.

1447
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,240
Speaker 4:  They're all in on the Taylor verse.

1448
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:47,960
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So, so Peacock is not doing great. It has not had any hits.

1449
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:51,560
Speaker 1:  It's still hoping poker face, like it's put a lot of, of time and energy

1450
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:54,840
Speaker 1:  into making poker face a thing. This is the new show with Natasha Leon. It

1451
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:58,320
Speaker 1:  comes from Ryan Johnson who did Knives Out and the Star Wars movies and stuff

1452
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,360
Speaker 1:  like that. So they're

1453
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:03,280
Speaker 4:  Really Ryan Johnson a Verge fan. Yeah. Yeah. In fact The Verge

1454
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,630
Speaker 4:  makes a cameo and knives. That too.
