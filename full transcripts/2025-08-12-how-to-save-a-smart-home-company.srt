Description: This week on The Vergecast, we enter the Jen-era of Hot Girl Vergecast Summer, with a deep dive into the business of the smart home. The Verge’s smart home reviewer, Jennifer Pattison Tuohy (aka Jen), chats with Ken Fairbanks, a longtime customer of Insteon who ended up buying the smart lighting company when it went into bankruptcy.

Ken shares the story of how one of the original smart lighting protocols, founded in the post-X10 era when home automation moved from wired to wireless, floundered, and how he and a band of users brought it back from the dead. He dishes what he’s learned about how to keep the lights on — from customer loyalty and the value of subscriptions, to what tariffs are doing to the industry and how some hardware companies are just pyramid schemes.

Then, in a special supersized (and we mean SUPER) Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com), Jen is joined by smart home expert Richard Gunther, co-host of The Smart Home Show, to tackle a bunch of your burning smart lighting questions. They answer everything from how to move your smart home to which Thread border router you should buy for your Matter setup. Plus, they run down their own smart lighting set-ups.

00:00:03,305 --> 00:00:07,035
Speaker 2:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of finally

3
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:11,155
Speaker 2:  figuring out how to get all of my smart lights working in one single

4
00:00:11,255 --> 00:00:14,835
Speaker 2:  app. I'm your friend Jen Tuy and welcome to the

5
00:00:15,055 --> 00:00:18,835
Speaker 2:  Jen era of The Vergecast. I will be here for the next two weeks

6
00:00:18,845 --> 00:00:22,675
Speaker 2:  while David gets to play with his gorgeous baby. Today on the show

7
00:00:22,775 --> 00:00:26,755
Speaker 2:  we are going to find out how you go about saving a smart home

8
00:00:26,755 --> 00:00:30,555
Speaker 2:  company. I'm chatting with Ken Fairbanks, CEO of

9
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:34,195
Speaker 2:  Insteon Technologies about the unlikely comeback of one of the

10
00:00:34,595 --> 00:00:38,315
Speaker 2:  original smart lighting companies. Then the guy I

11
00:00:38,475 --> 00:00:42,115
Speaker 2:  go to when I have questions about smart lighting, Richard Gunther

12
00:00:42,255 --> 00:00:46,035
Speaker 2:  is going to join me for a super sized Vergecast Hotline,

13
00:00:46,415 --> 00:00:50,155
Speaker 2:  all about smart lighting, where we tackle your burning and frankly,

14
00:00:50,285 --> 00:00:54,155
Speaker 2:  super complicated questions about how to make smart lighting work for you.

15
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:58,635
Speaker 2:  And all that is coming up right after the break. This is The

16
00:00:58,755 --> 00:01:00,355
Speaker 2:  Vergecast. We'll be right back.

17
00:02:34,505 --> 00:02:38,195
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. One of the biggest fears for every smart home user

18
00:02:38,335 --> 00:02:42,275
Speaker 2:  is that the products that they rely on to make their homes work well One

19
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:46,035
Speaker 2:  day stop working In 2022, I covered this exact

20
00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:49,475
Speaker 2:  story. How Smart Lighting Company Insteon went dark

21
00:02:49,905 --> 00:02:53,795
Speaker 2:  overnight. Someone flipped the switch and hundreds of thousands of customers

22
00:02:53,795 --> 00:02:56,555
Speaker 2:  were figuratively at least left in the dark.

23
00:02:57,345 --> 00:03:00,725
Speaker 2:  Insteon was not a fly-by-night startup either. It was floundered in

24
00:03:00,725 --> 00:03:04,565
Speaker 2:  2005 as one of the first smart lighting companies in the post

25
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:08,685
Speaker 2:  X 10 era when Smart Home went from wires to wireless.

26
00:03:09,465 --> 00:03:13,365
Speaker 2:  So what do you do when the product your home relies on

27
00:03:13,415 --> 00:03:17,005
Speaker 2:  stops working the way it's supposed to? My guest today, Ken

28
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:20,605
Speaker 2:  Fairbanks, is an early Insteon user and he had a really

29
00:03:20,715 --> 00:03:24,085
Speaker 2:  unusual solution to that problem. He bought the company.

30
00:03:24,945 --> 00:03:28,765
Speaker 2:  Now three years later, Insteon is back with a new website,

31
00:03:29,065 --> 00:03:32,085
Speaker 2:  new products, and Ken installed as CEO.

32
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:36,755
Speaker 2:  Welcome Ken. Thank you so much for being here with us on The Vergecast today.

33
00:03:37,455 --> 00:03:39,475
Speaker 6:  I'm looking forward to it. Thank you for the opportunity.

34
00:03:40,055 --> 00:03:43,875
Speaker 2:  So as I was just mentioning, you are one of the

35
00:03:44,645 --> 00:03:48,395
Speaker 2:  smart home users that actually decided to buy the Smart Home

36
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:52,155
Speaker 2:  Company, but you weren't exactly a

37
00:03:52,155 --> 00:03:55,915
Speaker 2:  typical Insteon customer where you actually helped start

38
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:59,875
Speaker 2:  this company early on and have a lot of experience in the smart home.

39
00:04:00,095 --> 00:04:03,435
Speaker 2:  So can you tell us a little bit about your background with Insteon?

40
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:07,875
Speaker 6:  Sure. So I was with Hewlett Packard for 20 some years. I left

41
00:04:07,945 --> 00:04:11,715
Speaker 6:  Hewlett Packard in early two thousands and started doing some business

42
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:15,555
Speaker 6:  consulting here in Southern California. And one of the companies

43
00:04:15,675 --> 00:04:17,635
Speaker 6:  I got introduced to was Smart Home.

44
00:04:17,945 --> 00:04:21,155
Speaker 2:  Okay. And Smart Home is the company that owned

45
00:04:21,505 --> 00:04:22,795
Speaker 2:  Insteon, is that right? Yes,

46
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:24,195
Speaker 6:  Yes, absolutely. Right.

47
00:04:24,255 --> 00:04:28,075
Speaker 2:  That's a great name. Yes it was. How did they get Smart Home as their

48
00:04:28,075 --> 00:04:28,315
Speaker 2:  name?

49
00:04:29,585 --> 00:04:33,515
Speaker 6:  Well, they were one of the early internet retailers and so URLs

50
00:04:33,515 --> 00:04:36,835
Speaker 6:  and names, you know, weren't as popular as they are now. So

51
00:04:37,305 --> 00:04:40,595
Speaker 6:  they got Smart home before anybody else did actually. So it was

52
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:45,075
Speaker 6:  by luck and being early to the marketing place I guess is the, the answer

53
00:04:45,075 --> 00:04:45,355
Speaker 6:  to that.

54
00:04:45,895 --> 00:04:49,195
Speaker 2:  Wow, great. Okay, so you were working for, you got to know Smart Home?

55
00:04:49,935 --> 00:04:53,915
Speaker 6:  Yes, I was consulting with them, helping them start to look at how

56
00:04:53,915 --> 00:04:57,675
Speaker 6:  they would roll out the Insteon technology and also the line of

57
00:04:57,995 --> 00:05:01,195
Speaker 6:  products that the lighting control products that they were gonna make. And

58
00:05:01,195 --> 00:05:04,915
Speaker 6:  then after six months they asked me to join the company And I did as the

59
00:05:04,915 --> 00:05:08,755
Speaker 6:  general manager of the technologies and products part of the company.

60
00:05:09,535 --> 00:05:10,955
Speaker 6:  So that's how I got involved with them.

61
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:15,275
Speaker 2:  So before we go into all of the, the trials and tribulations and how

62
00:05:15,385 --> 00:05:19,235
Speaker 2:  Insteon is hopefully on The Verge of a new dawn, tell me

63
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:23,035
Speaker 2:  just a little bit about Insteon for people who are listening who have

64
00:05:23,035 --> 00:05:26,715
Speaker 2:  never heard of this smart home lighting system

65
00:05:26,895 --> 00:05:28,395
Speaker 2:  and what Insteon does.

66
00:05:29,175 --> 00:05:32,875
Speaker 6:  So when Smart Home was starting out, they were selling a product

67
00:05:32,945 --> 00:05:34,635
Speaker 6:  from a company called X 10.

68
00:05:35,105 --> 00:05:38,635
Speaker 2:  Okay, so that's the original smart home protocol, right? Yes. And that was

69
00:05:38,635 --> 00:05:39,555
Speaker 2:  like over the wires?

70
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:43,635
Speaker 6:  Right. Okay. And that was the technology owned by somebody else. Okay. And

71
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:46,435
Speaker 6:  they were just selling the products. 'cause at that point they were just

72
00:05:46,435 --> 00:05:47,395
Speaker 6:  an internet retailer,

73
00:05:47,975 --> 00:05:51,155
Speaker 2:  One of the first ever internet retailers, is that right? Like one of the

74
00:05:51,155 --> 00:05:51,995
Speaker 2:  first dotcoms?

75
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:56,555
Speaker 6:  Yeah, they were hard coding the website. There was no Shopify or any of

76
00:05:56,555 --> 00:05:56,875
Speaker 6:  those things.

77
00:05:56,985 --> 00:05:57,205
Speaker 2:  So

78
00:05:57,755 --> 00:06:01,285
Speaker 6:  They're actually hard coding, you know, the website to get it up and running.

79
00:06:01,465 --> 00:06:05,365
Speaker 6:  So yeah, very, very early on, I think it was one of the first ones that

80
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:09,445
Speaker 6:  that got involved in taking advantage of the internet and the business was

81
00:06:09,445 --> 00:06:12,885
Speaker 6:  perfect for that because they were selling home automation and lots of little

82
00:06:12,885 --> 00:06:16,725
Speaker 6:  pieces and so really hard in a brick and mortar kind of thing

83
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:20,045
Speaker 6:  to be able to put enough product out and all the different brick and mortars

84
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:23,885
Speaker 6:  to be able to satisfy. So this internet really fit this business

85
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:27,845
Speaker 6:  segment extremely well and like that's why they succeeded and did so

86
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:28,325
Speaker 6:  well as well.

87
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:32,845
Speaker 2:  But then from this internet company, they

88
00:06:33,355 --> 00:06:37,125
Speaker 2:  form a smart home protocol and a smart home line.

89
00:06:37,385 --> 00:06:39,285
Speaker 2:  How did that jump happen? Some,

90
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:43,365
Speaker 6:  Some of it was just to be lucky. So they became the largest reseller of this

91
00:06:43,565 --> 00:06:47,485
Speaker 6:  X 10 technology and the founder was lucky to find

92
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:51,365
Speaker 6:  a very bright engineer named of Dan Craig. We call him the father of

93
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:55,205
Speaker 6:  Insteon and he still works with me. Oh as well. So he's the one that

94
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:59,045
Speaker 6:  developed the protocol. So he understood how the X 10 technology

95
00:06:59,465 --> 00:07:03,325
Speaker 6:  worked and understood the issues with the X 10. There were a number of issues

96
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:07,365
Speaker 6:  with the technology itself and he then really developed the Insteon

97
00:07:07,725 --> 00:07:11,325
Speaker 6:  protocol. And that's, and And I kind of related to it, you can k

98
00:07:11,355 --> 00:07:15,165
Speaker 6:  Insteon does at its heart run on the power line just like

99
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:16,005
Speaker 6:  X 10 did

100
00:07:16,825 --> 00:07:20,765
Speaker 2:  The power line of your home. So like all the wiring in your home. Okay. Right.

101
00:07:21,225 --> 00:07:24,525
Speaker 6:  In essence, how that works, it's, it was kind of curious to me, but it, you

102
00:07:24,525 --> 00:07:28,445
Speaker 6:  have the power in your house is 110 volts and it goes from

103
00:07:28,725 --> 00:07:32,645
Speaker 6:  positive to negative and it does that 120 times a second. So at

104
00:07:32,645 --> 00:07:36,445
Speaker 6:  those split seconds there's no electricity in your house. It just bare copper

105
00:07:36,515 --> 00:07:40,445
Speaker 6:  wire. So you at that precise second use that to transmit and that's

106
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:43,325
Speaker 6:  why you get the, the most reliable signal. 'cause it's hardwired, all the

107
00:07:43,325 --> 00:07:44,365
Speaker 6:  devices are hardwired

108
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,965
Speaker 2:  And this was X 10, that's how X 10 worked.

109
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:48,725
Speaker 6:  That's XX 10 worked as well.

110
00:07:49,155 --> 00:07:51,685
Speaker 2:  Okay. And then Insteon uses the same technology,

111
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:56,045
Speaker 6:  Well the same concept but different technology and how the signal

112
00:07:56,145 --> 00:07:59,805
Speaker 6:  is propagated and put on the line. I kind of related to, in the old days

113
00:07:59,825 --> 00:08:02,565
Speaker 6:  you had those dial up modems, right. You know

114
00:08:04,035 --> 00:08:08,005
Speaker 6:  that Right. And very slow. And then DSL came along, it

115
00:08:08,075 --> 00:08:11,565
Speaker 6:  uses the same copper wires but DSL and its speed and its

116
00:08:11,565 --> 00:08:15,445
Speaker 6:  reliability had nothing to do compared to the old motives. And

117
00:08:15,445 --> 00:08:19,045
Speaker 6:  that's kinda the same thing here. The Insteon technology took the reliability

118
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:22,525
Speaker 6:  of this up to professional class from where it was with X 10, which is really

119
00:08:22,925 --> 00:08:26,725
Speaker 6:  a hobbyist kind of technology. Right. And so that's how they

120
00:08:26,725 --> 00:08:30,525
Speaker 6:  developed that. And then that's about when I joined is we're just

121
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:34,445
Speaker 6:  getting ready to start close to launching that technology and the products.

122
00:08:35,105 --> 00:08:38,685
Speaker 2:  And so the technology is this hardwired

123
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:42,685
Speaker 2:  system with a radio, radio, wireless, radio

124
00:08:42,685 --> 00:08:46,285
Speaker 2:  frequency. So this was like one of the first sort of wireless smart lighting

125
00:08:46,285 --> 00:08:49,685
Speaker 2:  radio frequencies developed around the same time as like

126
00:08:49,865 --> 00:08:51,405
Speaker 2:  Z-Wave and ZigBee. Is that right?

127
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:52,405
Speaker 6:  Absolutely correct.

128
00:08:52,995 --> 00:08:56,685
Speaker 2:  Okay. And how does it differ from those types of technologies

129
00:08:56,685 --> 00:08:57,005
Speaker 2:  though?

130
00:08:57,595 --> 00:09:00,965
Speaker 6:  Well, it's lots of different ways. So first of all, it's a mesh network.

131
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:05,245
Speaker 6:  So we're not a routed network. So those networks are dependent upon

132
00:09:05,585 --> 00:09:09,525
Speaker 6:  you send a signal out or command out the next device and it's trying to get

133
00:09:09,525 --> 00:09:13,445
Speaker 6:  to a device. Next device has to repeat that. And so you actually, if you

134
00:09:13,525 --> 00:09:16,165
Speaker 6:  try and turn all the lights on in a house at once, you're gonna get what

135
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:19,725
Speaker 6:  we call popcorning because the message is routed, it has to go through. And

136
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,605
Speaker 6:  if one of those switches gets broken, then you're gonna

137
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:27,245
Speaker 6:  have a networking problem. So with the mesh network, every

138
00:09:27,245 --> 00:09:31,165
Speaker 6:  device, when you broadcast, every device hears that the signal at the

139
00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:35,005
Speaker 6:  same time and then we'll actually repeat it in

140
00:09:35,005 --> 00:09:38,285
Speaker 6:  simultaneously throughout the house. That's why you get very robust. But

141
00:09:38,285 --> 00:09:41,485
Speaker 6:  they're all single bands so you're dependent upon the radio frequency and

142
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:44,845
Speaker 6:  a and a lot of homes. That's a challenge if you've got brick or steel,

143
00:09:45,145 --> 00:09:48,125
Speaker 6:  you're trying to get from one end of the home to another. And so that's really

144
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:51,885
Speaker 6:  the uniqueness of it. 'cause we use the copper is our main and we use

145
00:09:51,945 --> 00:09:55,725
Speaker 6:  the the radio as a kind of a backup or, and and

146
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:59,085
Speaker 6:  that's where we're able to simulcast. So every signal goes out over both

147
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,005
Speaker 6:  mediums.

148
00:10:00,545 --> 00:10:03,085
Speaker 2:  So both over the wires and wireless.

149
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,845
Speaker 6:  And wireless all synchronized. So

150
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:09,525
Speaker 2:  It's kind of like, I guess for people who aren't familiar with the

151
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:13,605
Speaker 2:  X 10, it's sort of like having a hardwired and a mesh

152
00:10:14,075 --> 00:10:17,645
Speaker 2:  wifi internet network in your home. Right? Like the reliability of

153
00:10:17,645 --> 00:10:20,405
Speaker 2:  hardwired the flexibility of wireless.

154
00:10:20,915 --> 00:10:21,405
Speaker 6:  Correct.

155
00:10:21,915 --> 00:10:25,605
Speaker 2:  Okay. And this is for your smart lighting. So your light switches, your

156
00:10:25,895 --> 00:10:29,685
Speaker 2:  lamps, everything is working over dual band

157
00:10:30,095 --> 00:10:33,765
Speaker 2:  technology. So this makes it more reliable In theory.

158
00:10:34,185 --> 00:10:38,165
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah. Extremely, extremely reliable. Because if,

159
00:10:38,165 --> 00:10:40,885
Speaker 6:  if you have a little bit of a challenge, you can have some challenges with

160
00:10:40,885 --> 00:10:44,445
Speaker 6:  power line with some noise or something, the radio's gonna get the signal

161
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:47,965
Speaker 6:  there and if vice versa. So you really get

162
00:10:48,595 --> 00:10:52,565
Speaker 6:  this pairing of both signals coming to the device and

163
00:10:52,565 --> 00:10:55,885
Speaker 6:  the device is smart enough to know it's received the same signal twice. It

164
00:10:55,885 --> 00:10:59,765
Speaker 6:  doesn't act on it, two times it 'cause they're all synchronized. So it

165
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:03,365
Speaker 6:  has two opportunities to get the signal and that's what the strength and

166
00:11:03,365 --> 00:11:07,325
Speaker 6:  that's really the hallmark of the technology is its reliability. Right.

167
00:11:07,425 --> 00:11:11,245
Speaker 6:  And then just the, the overall simplicity of the network and how you

168
00:11:11,265 --> 00:11:15,205
Speaker 6:  set up devices and it, from the get go, it's set up. If

169
00:11:15,205 --> 00:11:18,965
Speaker 6:  you want to connect two devices together, it's just as simple. Go wire

170
00:11:19,065 --> 00:11:22,965
Speaker 6:  in, take your existing wall switch out, put the Insteon wall

171
00:11:23,165 --> 00:11:26,885
Speaker 6:  switch in, you wanna plug the lamp module And to have those two connect just

172
00:11:26,885 --> 00:11:30,565
Speaker 6:  press and hold the button on on the sending device and press and hold the

173
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:33,485
Speaker 6:  button on the receiving. They're now connected now they now talk.

174
00:11:33,945 --> 00:11:37,165
Speaker 2:  And you don't even need the app or even a hub or anything. It just works.

175
00:11:37,165 --> 00:11:41,045
Speaker 2:  No, that, okay. So this sounds great and this sounds like the type

176
00:11:41,045 --> 00:11:45,005
Speaker 2:  of smart lighting technology everyone would want in their home. So why

177
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:46,005
Speaker 2:  did it all fall apart?

178
00:11:46,515 --> 00:11:50,125
Speaker 6:  Well, you know, with a, you know, you could consider smart home a startup

179
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:53,945
Speaker 6:  company if you go back to the, when it first began. And

180
00:11:53,945 --> 00:11:57,025
Speaker 6:  it's a real challenge for a lot of companies. As you grow and you develop,

181
00:11:57,365 --> 00:12:00,825
Speaker 6:  the leadership team often needs to change 'cause the skill sets to really

182
00:12:00,825 --> 00:12:04,505
Speaker 6:  launch a new company are different than ones maybe to grow the company. Yeah.

183
00:12:04,505 --> 00:12:08,345
Speaker 6:  And I think that's a little bit what they, they fell into, the founder

184
00:12:08,445 --> 00:12:12,345
Speaker 6:  did a wonderful job developing the company and growing it. But I think

185
00:12:12,925 --> 00:12:16,665
Speaker 6:  in the end that became kind of an achilles heel for them and and their

186
00:12:16,665 --> 00:12:20,425
Speaker 6:  ability to be able to, to thoughtfully grow the company, they overextended

187
00:12:20,425 --> 00:12:20,985
Speaker 6:  themselves.

188
00:12:21,655 --> 00:12:25,385
Speaker 2:  Then in 2017, I believe it was bought by another

189
00:12:25,815 --> 00:12:26,105
Speaker 2:  user?

190
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:29,225
Speaker 6:  No. Essentially taken over by the shareholders.

191
00:12:29,725 --> 00:12:30,385
Speaker 2:  Oh, okay. So

192
00:12:30,385 --> 00:12:33,865
Speaker 6:  Rob, Rob Lowness was a shareholder. So a couple of the shareholders took

193
00:12:33,865 --> 00:12:34,545
Speaker 6:  over the company.

194
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,905
Speaker 2:  Okay. And this was in 2017.

195
00:12:37,475 --> 00:12:41,025
Speaker 6:  Right. Okay. And that's where they kind of scaled the company back from being

196
00:12:41,105 --> 00:12:44,825
Speaker 6:  a whole home automation, selling all the variety of products and really started

197
00:12:44,845 --> 00:12:48,705
Speaker 6:  to scale the company to focusing on the Insteon products only. So

198
00:12:48,705 --> 00:12:52,065
Speaker 6:  over a course of year or so, they kind of phased out the other products just

199
00:12:52,065 --> 00:12:53,385
Speaker 6:  to focus on the Insteon.

200
00:12:53,645 --> 00:12:57,465
Speaker 2:  So Rob takes over and we've got what, five

201
00:12:57,465 --> 00:13:01,385
Speaker 2:  years until 2022, where one

202
00:13:01,385 --> 00:13:04,465
Speaker 2:  day all of a sudden without warning

203
00:13:05,135 --> 00:13:08,985
Speaker 2:  someone flipped the switch. Yes. Just to overextend

204
00:13:08,985 --> 00:13:09,585
Speaker 2:  that metaphor.

205
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,585
Speaker 6:  Yeah, no, but that's exactly what he did. Exactly What

206
00:13:12,665 --> 00:13:15,385
Speaker 2:  Happened. That's exactly what you did. Yeah. What, okay, so tell me what

207
00:13:15,385 --> 00:13:19,145
Speaker 2:  caused the sort of the demise of the company at that

208
00:13:19,145 --> 00:13:19,385
Speaker 2:  stage?

209
00:13:20,385 --> 00:13:24,165
Speaker 6:  So I, I think there's a number of things. This marketplace is an interesting

210
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:27,725
Speaker 6:  one. It has some peculiarities to it and you really need to understand the

211
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:31,485
Speaker 6:  marketplace. And I think that was part of their challenge, really understanding

212
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:35,405
Speaker 6:  the marketplace and what's happening in the market. And he took the

213
00:13:35,405 --> 00:13:38,605
Speaker 6:  company in a different direction and yeah, once again,

214
00:13:38,765 --> 00:13:42,725
Speaker 6:  overextended the company. So they ran into, again, they, he ran 'em

215
00:13:42,725 --> 00:13:46,525
Speaker 6:  out of, ran 'em outta money and that's really what took place.

216
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:50,485
Speaker 6:  And so then he just closed the doors one day, let

217
00:13:50,485 --> 00:13:54,325
Speaker 6:  the employees go and then close the doors and turned off. What,

218
00:13:54,325 --> 00:13:58,205
Speaker 6:  what everyone relates to on this is there's all these hubs that, like

219
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:00,925
Speaker 6:  we mentioned, you can't, you don't need one, but lots of people have on,

220
00:14:01,065 --> 00:14:03,245
Speaker 6:  so you can get internet connectivity and

221
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,205
Speaker 2:  You don't need a hub for Insteon, but you can use a hub.

222
00:14:06,615 --> 00:14:10,605
Speaker 6:  Right. Okay. And that's, if you want to use your phone to turn the

223
00:14:10,605 --> 00:14:14,325
Speaker 6:  lights on and off, you want to use Alexa or Google or

224
00:14:14,465 --> 00:14:17,645
Speaker 6:  you know, HomeKit or any of those kinds of things. You need some bridge to

225
00:14:17,645 --> 00:14:21,565
Speaker 6:  the internet. And so that's what that's for. And also you can set up some

226
00:14:21,565 --> 00:14:25,445
Speaker 6:  routines and timers and some, some things like that using it. So

227
00:14:25,925 --> 00:14:29,805
Speaker 6:  famously what transpired is the users found out that something had

228
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:33,125
Speaker 6:  happened when their little hubs have a red and green light and all the hubs

229
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,005
Speaker 6:  turned red one day.

230
00:14:34,465 --> 00:14:38,325
Speaker 2:  Oh it's kind of like a scene out of a movie sci-fi movie.

231
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:39,925
Speaker 6:  Oh

232
00:14:39,925 --> 00:14:43,205
Speaker 2:  No. Just blinking red, red blink of death.

233
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:43,965
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

234
00:14:43,965 --> 00:14:47,885
Speaker 6:  There was no heads up. Which is just in these days doesn't make a lot of

235
00:14:47,885 --> 00:14:50,965
Speaker 6:  sense. You've seen companies have had a challenge, but they usually will

236
00:14:51,005 --> 00:14:54,405
Speaker 6:  get out an email or something to everybody, Hey sorry, we're gonna have to

237
00:14:54,615 --> 00:14:58,605
Speaker 6:  close up and give them some notice. But there was really no notice

238
00:14:58,705 --> 00:15:02,685
Speaker 6:  and that's what made everyone so upset. Yeah. It just one day in April, I

239
00:15:02,685 --> 00:15:05,925
Speaker 6:  think it was April 22nd when everything just turned off and

240
00:15:06,675 --> 00:15:10,365
Speaker 6:  without warning, without understanding what you know. So that's why everyone

241
00:15:10,365 --> 00:15:11,765
Speaker 6:  got very frustrated very quickly.

242
00:15:12,385 --> 00:15:16,365
Speaker 2:  And now you are an user. So did your hub go red? Oh

243
00:15:16,725 --> 00:15:19,685
Speaker 2:  yes it did. And what did you do?

244
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:24,525
Speaker 6:  So I called so the, like Dan Craig was still with the

245
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:27,685
Speaker 6:  company. Well he had just been let go obviously 'cause all the employees

246
00:15:27,685 --> 00:15:31,605
Speaker 6:  had been let go. So I called and talked to a couple of the employees that

247
00:15:31,605 --> 00:15:34,965
Speaker 6:  I know 'cause a number of 'em worked for me when I was there too. And so

248
00:15:34,965 --> 00:15:38,885
Speaker 6:  I called them and said, what's going on? What's happened? And they explained

249
00:15:38,885 --> 00:15:42,445
Speaker 6:  that the company went bankrupt and he just shut it off. And I was involved.

250
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:46,445
Speaker 6:  I still am with an investment group here in Orange County. And so I

251
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:50,325
Speaker 6:  was just kind of curious to learn. And so I actually reached out to see if

252
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:54,125
Speaker 6:  I could just learn what was going on with no intention at that

253
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,285
Speaker 6:  point of buying the company.

254
00:15:56,075 --> 00:15:59,965
Speaker 2:  Okay. So you hadn't sort of formed a plan like, okay, now's my

255
00:15:59,965 --> 00:16:03,645
Speaker 2:  chance. I'm back in, back in the game, gonna buy the company.

256
00:16:03,985 --> 00:16:07,845
Speaker 2:  So, okay, so the hubs are shut off. Everyone is thinking

257
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:11,485
Speaker 2:  it's done. And I know when you, once you decided to

258
00:16:12,245 --> 00:16:15,685
Speaker 2:  relaunch the site, you said a small group of passionate users had brought

259
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:18,725
Speaker 2:  it together. So can you talk me through how this little group came together

260
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:22,405
Speaker 2:  and what, what you did and how you decided that you were gonna pull together

261
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:25,125
Speaker 2:  and resurrect the Insteon Smart home?

262
00:16:25,745 --> 00:16:29,605
Speaker 6:  So when I, I talked to the trustee of first of all the trustee that was

263
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:33,205
Speaker 6:  now, so what happens in an A, BC bankruptcy, it's kind of interesting. A

264
00:16:33,205 --> 00:16:36,645
Speaker 6:  new company is formed in L in California. It's an LLC called an

265
00:16:36,685 --> 00:16:40,485
Speaker 6:  A-B-C-L-L-C. And basically all the assets of the company are transferred

266
00:16:40,485 --> 00:16:44,205
Speaker 6:  over to that, that new LLC. Right. And the trustees then

267
00:16:44,305 --> 00:16:48,005
Speaker 6:  put in charge of selling the assets. Okay. Not trying to get the company

268
00:16:48,005 --> 00:16:49,645
Speaker 6:  back would've just selling the assets.

269
00:16:49,895 --> 00:16:52,965
Speaker 2:  Right. I think you mentioned this when we chatted before that Right. This

270
00:16:52,965 --> 00:16:56,605
Speaker 2:  was something very unique to Silicon Valley. Right, right. 'cause so many

271
00:16:56,685 --> 00:17:00,445
Speaker 2:  startups would just disappear. Yes. And like

272
00:17:00,465 --> 00:17:04,245
Speaker 2:  no one would know what to do with the furniture or Right, that's

273
00:17:04,245 --> 00:17:08,045
Speaker 2:  exactly right. There was no one around, unlike most brick and mortar companies

274
00:17:08,045 --> 00:17:11,845
Speaker 2:  where this, you can go knock on a door and say, Hey, you know, pay my

275
00:17:11,845 --> 00:17:15,165
Speaker 2:  bill. They just evaporate. So this isn't very unique

276
00:17:15,215 --> 00:17:18,765
Speaker 2:  bankruptcy. So someone just comes in and takes over

277
00:17:19,185 --> 00:17:22,365
Speaker 2:  and then tries to sell whatever they can find.

278
00:17:23,035 --> 00:17:26,485
Speaker 2:  Like literally lift up the cushions and see what's underneath. Okay.

279
00:17:26,905 --> 00:17:28,605
Speaker 2:  And so you, this is where you came in.

280
00:17:28,745 --> 00:17:32,565
Speaker 6:  That's exactly right. That's when I started talking to them and

281
00:17:33,365 --> 00:17:35,885
Speaker 6:  I said, well what are you looking to sell the company for? And they gave

282
00:17:35,885 --> 00:17:39,605
Speaker 6:  me a number And I said, well, we're not, no, my group's not interested, we're

283
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:43,245
Speaker 6:  not interested. And kind of, that was the end of it. And then they

284
00:17:43,515 --> 00:17:47,485
Speaker 6:  kept calling me and saying, make an offer, make an

285
00:17:47,485 --> 00:17:51,005
Speaker 6:  offer. I go, I, I can't make an offer. I'm not gonna, that's not gonna.

286
00:17:51,585 --> 00:17:55,325
Speaker 6:  And they go, no, make an offer. I go, no, I'm not gonna insult you. And they

287
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:58,405
Speaker 6:  just kept bugging me. And I think what they knew is that I knew the people

288
00:17:58,425 --> 00:18:02,405
Speaker 6:  at the company And I had the ability, not that I'm a bright guy, I

289
00:18:02,405 --> 00:18:05,885
Speaker 6:  knew the people that could help bring the company back. Yeah. Quickly. It

290
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:09,605
Speaker 6:  would be very difficult for anybody else to resurrect a company

291
00:18:09,665 --> 00:18:13,285
Speaker 6:  as quickly as we were able to do it. I put this group together, it was the

292
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:17,405
Speaker 6:  CTO gentleman was head of manufacturing force

293
00:18:17,705 --> 00:18:21,165
Speaker 6:  in our products are manufactured overseas. The marketing person

294
00:18:21,745 --> 00:18:25,565
Speaker 6:  is, was those triad that I brought together. That was the band of US four.

295
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:29,445
Speaker 6:  And now since added some additional people that knew all the things to do

296
00:18:29,465 --> 00:18:32,685
Speaker 6:  to get the company back up and running. Yeah. And so that's why we're able

297
00:18:32,685 --> 00:18:35,765
Speaker 6:  to do it very quickly. So they were smarter to understand I could actually

298
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:39,845
Speaker 6:  bring some value to it. So I, I made 'em an, if they pushed

299
00:18:39,845 --> 00:18:43,245
Speaker 6:  me enough, I may have an offer that I thought they would absolutely refuse.

300
00:18:44,435 --> 00:18:46,845
Speaker 2:  They didn't. Okay. So this is how you do it, you low ball.

301
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:53,525
Speaker 6:  I was really taken aback when they said yes, we'll accept that.

302
00:18:53,945 --> 00:18:57,125
Speaker 6:  And now I understand why. 'cause they weren't gonna get anything for the

303
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:00,325
Speaker 6:  company. 'cause there weren't a lot of physical assets, there weren't a lot

304
00:19:00,325 --> 00:19:04,085
Speaker 6:  of product or whatever. There just wasn't a lot of value to, you know, the

305
00:19:04,085 --> 00:19:07,165
Speaker 6:  patents and everything at value. But someone else would have to come and

306
00:19:07,165 --> 00:19:10,605
Speaker 6:  figure out how to do that. How do you, you know, like I said, I had the father

307
00:19:10,605 --> 00:19:14,485
Speaker 6:  of Insteon alongside of me. So he knows the technology. We had all the pieces

308
00:19:14,845 --> 00:19:18,645
Speaker 6:  together and, and they're all very passionate. The one thing is all

309
00:19:18,665 --> 00:19:22,205
Speaker 6:  the employees there and, and myself included at the time, we were very

310
00:19:22,205 --> 00:19:26,005
Speaker 6:  passionate about what we were doing and very disappointed to see

311
00:19:26,005 --> 00:19:29,725
Speaker 6:  where the company had head. So, and still everyone's very passionate about

312
00:19:29,725 --> 00:19:33,365
Speaker 6:  we're doing this 'cause you know, yes, it's a job and things, but really

313
00:19:33,365 --> 00:19:36,525
Speaker 6:  doing it. 'cause we feel passion and a lot for our customer base. We have

314
00:19:36,565 --> 00:19:38,005
Speaker 6:  a very unique customer base.

315
00:19:38,555 --> 00:19:41,685
Speaker 2:  Well, and what about you Ken? I mean, did you not have a job?

316
00:19:42,745 --> 00:19:43,405
Speaker 2:  Oh, you

317
00:19:43,405 --> 00:19:43,965
Speaker 6:  Like I was retired.

318
00:19:44,265 --> 00:19:48,125
Speaker 2:  Oh, you were retired. Okay. So that is when you wanna, you wanna

319
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,085
Speaker 2:  go and buy a smart company. Yeah.

320
00:19:51,865 --> 00:19:53,725
Speaker 2:  So you're on a beach in Hawaii.

321
00:19:54,385 --> 00:19:54,845
Speaker 6:  Oh yes.

322
00:19:56,485 --> 00:20:00,365
Speaker 6:  Famously it still amazes me that you can be on the beach on a cell phone

323
00:20:01,105 --> 00:20:04,685
Speaker 6:  and buying a company. It's, it's just kind of, I,

324
00:20:04,945 --> 00:20:08,445
Speaker 6:  I'm a tech guy, but it still boggles my mind that you can have all that

325
00:20:08,565 --> 00:20:12,525
Speaker 6:  transact while you're sitting on a, a beach there. And it, it's kind of

326
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:15,645
Speaker 6:  a fun story. It was a vacation we'd previously planned with my wife

327
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:20,405
Speaker 6:  and the transaction is taking longer, is they typically do

328
00:20:20,405 --> 00:20:24,125
Speaker 6:  with lawyers and documents and things. And, And I said, you know,

329
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:28,085
Speaker 6:  everyone, I'm losing customers every day 'cause their hubs are turned off.

330
00:20:28,905 --> 00:20:32,805
Speaker 6:  And I said, I I know I gotta turn these back on. So I talked

331
00:20:32,805 --> 00:20:36,525
Speaker 6:  to the team and they said, yeah, we know exactly what to do. We can have

332
00:20:36,645 --> 00:20:40,045
Speaker 6:  'em turned on tomorrow. There's one company we have to talk to

333
00:20:40,545 --> 00:20:44,045
Speaker 6:  and have them flip the switch. And I had to pay 'em a little bit of money.

334
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:48,365
Speaker 6:  And I said, you know, even though I don't own the company now, I just know

335
00:20:48,385 --> 00:20:51,645
Speaker 6:  I'm losing people if this is gonna take another week or so, I just can't,

336
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:56,045
Speaker 6:  I can't stand that. Yeah. So I actually decided to just bite the bullet

337
00:20:56,225 --> 00:21:00,045
Speaker 6:  and turn the hubs on. And that was on a Tuesday. The

338
00:21:00,045 --> 00:21:03,725
Speaker 6:  lights all turned green and the social media started lighting up.

339
00:21:03,865 --> 00:21:07,725
Speaker 6:  Oh my gosh. Is yours on? Mine's on. Oh this is great. Who's doing this? Who's

340
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:11,565
Speaker 6:  behind? Anyone know who this is? Oh, this is awesome. This is great.

341
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:15,635
Speaker 6:  Oh, that was all, that was Tuesday, Wednesday. Who

342
00:21:15,655 --> 00:21:18,035
Speaker 6:  is the evil person that's turned these on?

343
00:21:19,355 --> 00:21:23,315
Speaker 2:  I remember our headline was like, somebody has turned

344
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:27,155
Speaker 2:  the lights back on, but who that, you know, someone's

345
00:21:27,155 --> 00:21:30,275
Speaker 2:  running your smart home. But yeah. Okay. So tell us what happened.

346
00:21:31,015 --> 00:21:34,675
Speaker 6:  So there, yeah, so all the, the, the conspiracy theories came up of

347
00:21:34,675 --> 00:21:38,035
Speaker 6:  blaming all sorts of people trying to get into the homes. And I was under

348
00:21:38,035 --> 00:21:41,675
Speaker 6:  non-disclosure at that point so I couldn't come and say anything.

349
00:21:42,215 --> 00:21:44,595
Speaker 2:  Oh. So you're just sitting there going, ah,

350
00:21:46,075 --> 00:21:47,795
Speaker 2:  everyone's freaking out And I can't say anything.

351
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:51,955
Speaker 6:  So luckily on Thursday we're finally able to sign the agreement

352
00:21:52,655 --> 00:21:56,035
Speaker 6:  and then we could put out the email saying who we were and why we'd done

353
00:21:56,035 --> 00:21:59,875
Speaker 6:  it. And we're happy to have it back and look forward to growing

354
00:21:59,895 --> 00:22:03,675
Speaker 6:  the company. I gotta tell you one side note just about, and it goes back

355
00:22:03,675 --> 00:22:07,395
Speaker 6:  to the, this fantastic customer base I have. Yeah. So on a on

356
00:22:07,395 --> 00:22:10,995
Speaker 6:  Friday I get a call from one of our, my now customers

357
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,915
Speaker 6:  didn't know who it was or anything, how he got my cell phone, I don't know.

358
00:22:17,095 --> 00:22:20,955
Speaker 6:  And he goes, Hey, what's the address for the company? And I'm like,

359
00:22:22,115 --> 00:22:26,075
Speaker 6:  I don't, I I don't have a, so I gave him my home address, which home address,

360
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,995
Speaker 6:  which made my wife real happy. She goes, you know how many people are upset

361
00:22:29,995 --> 00:22:33,315
Speaker 6:  with the previous owner though? I don't want our address. I go, I didn't

362
00:22:33,315 --> 00:22:37,035
Speaker 6:  know what to do. Oh. So I gave it to him. So we get

363
00:22:37,035 --> 00:22:40,715
Speaker 6:  home couple days later, I think it was Monday or Tuesday, and here's a letter

364
00:22:40,715 --> 00:22:44,675
Speaker 6:  from this gentleman and his wife, handwritten letter. Thank you so much

365
00:22:44,735 --> 00:22:48,555
Speaker 6:  for bringing this back. I really appreciate it And I hope this will

366
00:22:48,555 --> 00:22:52,195
Speaker 6:  help. Maybe you can celebrate or something. It was a check for $2,000.

367
00:22:52,735 --> 00:22:53,755
Speaker 2:  Oh wow. And

368
00:22:53,755 --> 00:22:57,515
Speaker 6:  I said, is there something, I wrote 'em back, is there some I have a little

369
00:22:57,515 --> 00:23:00,755
Speaker 6:  bit of product and yeah. Can I give you something or whatever. Nope. Don't

370
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:04,315
Speaker 6:  want anything. Just thank you so much. And that's the specialness of the

371
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:07,995
Speaker 6:  user base and that's what keeps us all going because we, we have such great

372
00:23:08,355 --> 00:23:11,795
Speaker 6:  installed base, we call it our family or a community and really believe in

373
00:23:11,795 --> 00:23:11,875
Speaker 6:  that.

374
00:23:12,345 --> 00:23:16,235
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So how long was it between lights turning off

375
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:17,715
Speaker 2:  to Lights turning back on

376
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:21,875
Speaker 6:  April 22nd to June 8th. Okay. So it was quite a long time.

377
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:26,235
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And now they, they were able to use their devices, right? It

378
00:23:26,235 --> 00:23:29,675
Speaker 2:  wasn't like, yes we are in darkness, it's just they'd lost some function

379
00:23:30,215 --> 00:23:34,115
Speaker 2:  and Correct. Potentially felt like they were no longer gonna be able to

380
00:23:34,115 --> 00:23:37,835
Speaker 2:  buy new product or have see any advancements or

381
00:23:37,835 --> 00:23:41,755
Speaker 2:  improvements come to the product. Okay. So you've bought a

382
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:45,565
Speaker 2:  smart home company. This took, it sounds like about six

383
00:23:45,565 --> 00:23:46,645
Speaker 2:  weeks to sort of,

384
00:23:46,905 --> 00:23:47,405
Speaker 6:  You're right,

385
00:23:47,675 --> 00:23:51,325
Speaker 2:  Turn the lights back on. So what's the next step? What did you have to do?

386
00:23:51,325 --> 00:23:54,965
Speaker 2:  Because obviously there's got to have been a lot of concern

387
00:23:55,395 --> 00:23:59,125
Speaker 2:  from that in-store base saying what's happening and

388
00:23:59,225 --> 00:24:03,045
Speaker 2:  you know, how do you win back Customer trust, how do you rebuild a

389
00:24:03,045 --> 00:24:06,365
Speaker 2:  brand after this type of kind of, you know,

390
00:24:07,225 --> 00:24:09,765
Speaker 2:  how do you, how do you raise the Phoenix from the flames here?

391
00:24:11,475 --> 00:24:15,285
Speaker 6:  Well the first part is, is the easiest one. Just be honest and truthful and

392
00:24:15,285 --> 00:24:18,925
Speaker 6:  upfront and you know, I, we scheduled Zoom meetings,

393
00:24:18,935 --> 00:24:22,925
Speaker 6:  which all our customer base was invited to attend and we'd

394
00:24:22,925 --> 00:24:26,565
Speaker 6:  get several hundred each one of the times I do that. And just be

395
00:24:26,585 --> 00:24:30,525
Speaker 6:  candid, take questions, live questions for them and just be

396
00:24:30,525 --> 00:24:33,405
Speaker 6:  honest in what we're doing and tell 'em what our challenges are and how we're

397
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:37,165
Speaker 6:  gonna grow the company. So I mean the first thing for to do was to get our

398
00:24:37,165 --> 00:24:41,085
Speaker 6:  products remanufactured. So getting the manufacturing lines

399
00:24:41,195 --> 00:24:44,925
Speaker 6:  back up again, contacting our, the previous or the, the contract

400
00:24:44,925 --> 00:24:48,885
Speaker 6:  manufacturers were making them and start to give 'em orders and get the products,

401
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,885
Speaker 6:  you know, underbuilt. But that, that took, you know, three or four months,

402
00:24:52,475 --> 00:24:55,285
Speaker 6:  just once you get the orders, takes three or four months with shipping and

403
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:59,045
Speaker 6:  everything to get that up. So that was a key part of ensured everybody. We

404
00:24:59,045 --> 00:25:02,845
Speaker 6:  we're, we've got the products, we've got the important ones already on order.

405
00:25:03,065 --> 00:25:06,765
Speaker 6:  And then we also find as we built out the whole family of products. 'cause

406
00:25:06,765 --> 00:25:10,605
Speaker 6:  now we, we have about a hundred SKUs and as we've been adding

407
00:25:10,605 --> 00:25:13,365
Speaker 6:  them in, that's one of the things where I engage the community. Say, okay,

408
00:25:13,365 --> 00:25:16,245
Speaker 6:  I've got these products, we've got this going, what's the next one you want

409
00:25:16,245 --> 00:25:19,925
Speaker 6:  me to, to go spend time? 'cause I wanna be thoughtful in growing the company.

410
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:23,925
Speaker 6:  I don't wanna financially overextend it again, which has been done before.

411
00:25:24,395 --> 00:25:27,365
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And I've been very open with everybody. That's what we're doing and

412
00:25:27,365 --> 00:25:30,125
Speaker 6:  that's why we're easing all the products. And now, you know, three years

413
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:33,845
Speaker 6:  later just about all the products are are back in manufacturing and we,

414
00:25:33,985 --> 00:25:37,925
Speaker 6:  we have 'em back in stock. The other part then was related to the,

415
00:25:37,945 --> 00:25:41,925
Speaker 6:  the hubs and really a belief is we sat down and

416
00:25:41,925 --> 00:25:45,285
Speaker 6:  talked about it and this is, I think we're gonna see this across the marketplace,

417
00:25:45,345 --> 00:25:49,285
Speaker 6:  but I really felt it was important that the app and the hub

418
00:25:49,425 --> 00:25:53,405
Speaker 6:  be a self-sustaining business. And I, I realize that a lot of the

419
00:25:53,405 --> 00:25:56,645
Speaker 6:  competition, a lot of people out there today, they

420
00:25:57,085 --> 00:26:00,965
Speaker 6:  subsidize the app through hardware sales. And

421
00:26:01,165 --> 00:26:04,085
Speaker 6:  I, I just don't think that's a sustainable business. As long as you keep

422
00:26:04,185 --> 00:26:08,165
Speaker 6:  con growing your hardware and stuff, you can get away with that for a while.

423
00:26:08,165 --> 00:26:11,565
Speaker 6:  And I think we're gonna find a lot of the manufacturers now And I think even

424
00:26:11,805 --> 00:26:15,565
Speaker 6:  Amazon's talking about it with Alexa and stuff of starting to have

425
00:26:15,565 --> 00:26:19,445
Speaker 6:  levels of price for it. So make it very affordable. But it

426
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:23,405
Speaker 6:  also then enables us to independently invest in the app. 'cause

427
00:26:23,405 --> 00:26:26,365
Speaker 6:  they had not been investing in the app. So yeah, the app was free,

428
00:26:27,215 --> 00:26:30,235
Speaker 6:  it was being subset of hardware, but they weren't spending any money to develop

429
00:26:30,235 --> 00:26:33,995
Speaker 6:  the app. So the app would been stagnant for a couple years. And, and

430
00:26:34,055 --> 00:26:37,915
Speaker 6:  so we've been taking that, that revenue and have been investing in improving

431
00:26:37,975 --> 00:26:41,915
Speaker 6:  the app, adding new features to the app and building that that

432
00:26:41,915 --> 00:26:45,210
Speaker 6:  back out. And for the most part people have been accepting of that and understanding

433
00:26:45,225 --> 00:26:48,725
Speaker 6:  why we're doing that. And the assurance to them is it's not gonna just shut

434
00:26:48,725 --> 00:26:51,285
Speaker 6:  down again one day. Right. The lights aren't gonna turn red.

435
00:26:51,785 --> 00:26:55,165
Speaker 2:  So when you say of that, so you, you instituted a subscription, is that,

436
00:26:55,225 --> 00:26:55,685
Speaker 2:  is that right?

437
00:26:55,685 --> 00:26:56,805
Speaker 6:  Yes. Subscription. Yeah.

438
00:26:56,915 --> 00:27:00,565
Speaker 2:  Okay. And for what, what do you need the subscription for? Like can you use

439
00:27:00,565 --> 00:27:02,525
Speaker 2:  the devices without the subscription or?

440
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:06,845
Speaker 6:  Absolutely. As I mentioned, you don't need a hub, you don't need any kind

441
00:27:06,845 --> 00:27:10,605
Speaker 6:  of computer module like, and that is unique to Insteon. I think almost

442
00:27:10,605 --> 00:27:14,445
Speaker 6:  every other needs some kind of controller to be able to even set

443
00:27:14,445 --> 00:27:18,165
Speaker 6:  up devices. We can go into some of the particulars, but you can do a lot

444
00:27:18,165 --> 00:27:20,845
Speaker 6:  of advanced features without any kind of hub.

445
00:27:21,195 --> 00:27:25,165
Speaker 2:  Okay. But now if you want the hub and you want the app for that kind

446
00:27:25,165 --> 00:27:29,005
Speaker 2:  of control with your phone control with Voice. Voice. Right. Presumably

447
00:27:29,195 --> 00:27:33,045
Speaker 2:  like with Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant, you

448
00:27:33,315 --> 00:27:36,845
Speaker 2:  need the app and the hub. Yes. And how much does that cost Now

449
00:27:37,995 --> 00:27:41,935
Speaker 6:  The app is $39 a year and the hub is

450
00:27:41,935 --> 00:27:45,895
Speaker 6:  $99 with one year of free subscription. So I include one

451
00:27:45,895 --> 00:27:49,575
Speaker 6:  year with the subscription with the purchase of a new hub. Okay. And

452
00:27:49,575 --> 00:27:53,175
Speaker 6:  then's $39 a year. There's a, if you buy two years, you get it for a little

453
00:27:53,175 --> 00:27:53,495
Speaker 6:  bit less.

454
00:27:54,155 --> 00:27:55,175
Speaker 2:  And what does that get you?

455
00:27:56,475 --> 00:28:00,295
Speaker 6:  So it gets you a, a number of things. One of the things is we back up your

456
00:28:00,535 --> 00:28:04,375
Speaker 6:  configuration. So if you ever have a problem, you can get

457
00:28:04,415 --> 00:28:08,175
Speaker 6:  a new hub and we can repopulate the hub. So you have a backup of your

458
00:28:08,455 --> 00:28:12,095
Speaker 6:  configuration, you can see your configuration, you can download it,

459
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:15,855
Speaker 6:  it allows you also, you can do setup instead of press press,

460
00:28:16,835 --> 00:28:20,215
Speaker 6:  you can do the setup from the app. You just say connect these two devices

461
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:24,495
Speaker 6:  together. You can do that. You can set up timed events and

462
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:28,295
Speaker 6:  then as we mentioned you, you get voice, you get, you know, phone connections

463
00:28:28,355 --> 00:28:31,495
Speaker 6:  so you can control, you also can get alerts now. So you can get an alert

464
00:28:31,495 --> 00:28:35,255
Speaker 6:  that the water you, the water sensor's gone off and you can get an alert

465
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:39,095
Speaker 6:  sent to your phone. So, or the door's been open, right. So you can all, you

466
00:28:39,095 --> 00:28:42,295
Speaker 6:  get the alerts. So all those kind of features coming and we're looking at

467
00:28:42,295 --> 00:28:45,855
Speaker 6:  additional features in the future coming. So we're

468
00:28:45,855 --> 00:28:47,695
Speaker 6:  continuing to add things to the app as well

469
00:28:48,195 --> 00:28:51,935
Speaker 2:  Now. But these were features that previously they use as had

470
00:28:51,935 --> 00:28:55,255
Speaker 2:  without having to pay. So how did that go down with the user base?

471
00:28:56,005 --> 00:28:58,695
Speaker 2:  Because that's generally not well received.

472
00:29:00,445 --> 00:29:04,255
Speaker 6:  Well a again I think that we have a special install base and

473
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:08,095
Speaker 6:  when I explained to them And I was very honest with them that this needs

474
00:29:08,095 --> 00:29:11,935
Speaker 6:  to be a self-sustaining business. You, you just can't subsidize it long

475
00:29:11,935 --> 00:29:15,775
Speaker 6:  term. And particularly we had no hardware to even sell if we wanted to do

476
00:29:15,775 --> 00:29:19,175
Speaker 2:  That at that point. Right. At that point. Right. 'cause you were still ramping

477
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:20,895
Speaker 2:  up the supply chain. Right? Right.

478
00:29:21,425 --> 00:29:25,335
Speaker 6:  Exact Exactly right. So I think they, they appreciated the honesty

479
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:30,255
Speaker 6:  Fort Wright and they also now appreciated the investment. 'cause now they're

480
00:29:30,255 --> 00:29:34,055
Speaker 6:  seeing that the app is actually getting better. So they're not just

481
00:29:34,055 --> 00:29:37,495
Speaker 6:  putting, they're seeing the app improve. Yeah. I don't have to raise the

482
00:29:37,695 --> 00:29:41,565
Speaker 6:  hardware prices just to subsidize that so I can keep the hardware prices,

483
00:29:41,975 --> 00:29:45,685
Speaker 6:  which is the vast majority of your cost is gonna be through hardware. Right.

484
00:29:46,005 --> 00:29:49,725
Speaker 6:  Versus you know, the app, you know, it's a one one time a year fee. It's,

485
00:29:49,725 --> 00:29:53,605
Speaker 6:  you know, not that great. I mean $39 isn't gonna break anybody so to speak.

486
00:29:53,705 --> 00:29:57,445
Speaker 6:  But, but you do get the pushback, oh wait, I can get this from free before.

487
00:29:57,505 --> 00:30:01,365
Speaker 6:  And I said Yeah but understand that's also partially why the

488
00:30:01,365 --> 00:30:04,965
Speaker 6:  company had to shut down. Right. Because they didn't have the revenue coming

489
00:30:05,025 --> 00:30:08,085
Speaker 6:  in to support it. And I don't want that to happen again. I don't want there

490
00:30:08,085 --> 00:30:12,045
Speaker 6:  to be an issue. I wanna be able to run the, you know, continue the hub businesses

491
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:13,165
Speaker 6:  a self-sustaining business

492
00:30:13,715 --> 00:30:17,125
Speaker 2:  Then. That's interesting. We're seeing this happen more and more with hardware

493
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:20,605
Speaker 2:  smart home companies that they're adding subscriptions. Do you really feel

494
00:30:20,605 --> 00:30:24,365
Speaker 2:  like that is the only sort of long-term sustainable

495
00:30:25,165 --> 00:30:28,405
Speaker 2:  business model for the smart home as like recurring subscriptions? And if

496
00:30:28,425 --> 00:30:32,125
Speaker 2:  so, why is that? Why can it not just depend on hardware?

497
00:30:32,675 --> 00:30:32,965
Speaker 2:  Well

498
00:30:33,425 --> 00:30:37,245
Speaker 6:  It, it's, it's an interesting thing. So the lighting control, we have a little

499
00:30:37,245 --> 00:30:40,805
Speaker 6:  bit of unique position, right. Because as I mentioned, you're gonna continue

500
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:44,605
Speaker 6:  to add products to the home and grow the home. So you get continue for that

501
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:48,045
Speaker 6:  user, it's gonna continue to get hardware sales and so you can

502
00:30:48,675 --> 00:30:52,325
Speaker 6:  justify it, potentially justify subsidizing the app. But if you,

503
00:30:52,545 --> 00:30:56,245
Speaker 6:  you go and look at the apps, the most other home automation

504
00:30:56,245 --> 00:30:59,485
Speaker 6:  devices in the home are single unit. Maybe you have two

505
00:30:59,595 --> 00:31:03,565
Speaker 6:  thermostats, probably not. You probably have one thermostat. I just

506
00:31:03,585 --> 00:31:07,565
Speaker 6:  put in a water sensor, a leak sensor at the, at

507
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:09,925
Speaker 6:  the main, you know, I'm gonna buy one of those for the house. There's only

508
00:31:09,925 --> 00:31:13,445
Speaker 6:  one pipe I can connect that to. So if you look at that, they're gonna get

509
00:31:13,485 --> 00:31:17,285
Speaker 6:  a one time hardware sale from me and then supposedly now they're gonna

510
00:31:17,285 --> 00:31:21,245
Speaker 6:  gimme this free app for the rest of my life. And it's, you

511
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:25,205
Speaker 6:  can see it's not sustainable. Yeah. It, it becomes a little bit of a pyramid

512
00:31:25,265 --> 00:31:29,005
Speaker 6:  scheme of sorts. You gotta keep getting the, the next user that's gonna put

513
00:31:29,005 --> 00:31:32,965
Speaker 6:  in that water sensor to pay for my free service that

514
00:31:32,965 --> 00:31:33,645
Speaker 6:  I'm getting and

515
00:31:33,745 --> 00:31:37,525
Speaker 2:  Oh, the smart home is a pyramid scheme. Yeah. I like it.

516
00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:40,445
Speaker 2:  But that,

517
00:31:40,945 --> 00:31:44,765
Speaker 6:  And I think it also, this helps too. It puts, it's incumbent

518
00:31:44,835 --> 00:31:48,605
Speaker 6:  upon the manufacturers and for us we gotta add real value with the

519
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:52,605
Speaker 6:  hub too. And in the app. Yeah. We gotta continue to add value to it and

520
00:31:52,605 --> 00:31:56,125
Speaker 6:  if it doesn't deliver value, then okay, I understand then you shouldn't be

521
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:59,885
Speaker 6:  using it. And there are other solutions. There are other companies that

522
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:03,245
Speaker 6:  provide apps to control our, so you don't have to use us either. And some

523
00:32:03,245 --> 00:32:03,805
Speaker 6:  of them are free.

524
00:32:04,385 --> 00:32:08,085
Speaker 2:  Did you find that there was much of a drop off from the user base once you

525
00:32:08,085 --> 00:32:11,965
Speaker 2:  added the subscription model? Or, or were most people kind

526
00:32:11,965 --> 00:32:15,805
Speaker 2:  of happy to, to pitch in so to speak, seen as you had bought the

527
00:32:15,805 --> 00:32:17,765
Speaker 2:  company for them? Yeah,

528
00:32:18,485 --> 00:32:21,925
Speaker 6:  A large, a large portion of them continued with us the,

529
00:32:22,665 --> 00:32:25,605
Speaker 6:  the renewal rates. 'cause we've now, this is our third year

530
00:32:26,395 --> 00:32:30,245
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Of renewals. The renewal rate's very high. So I'm really pleased with

531
00:32:30,245 --> 00:32:33,845
Speaker 6:  that. So the most common thing, if the renewal doesn't happen, it's,

532
00:32:34,205 --> 00:32:37,965
Speaker 6:  I moved houses, I've told the new homeowner how to go get it and I'll be

533
00:32:37,965 --> 00:32:41,565
Speaker 6:  buying this with my new house that I've bought. That's our, our biggest 'cause

534
00:32:41,565 --> 00:32:44,805
Speaker 6:  we do, if you don't renew, we ask you why. And that's our biggest one is

535
00:32:45,045 --> 00:32:45,685
Speaker 6:  I moved homes.

536
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:50,365
Speaker 2:  So because you run a smart home company and you manufacture overseas, I

537
00:32:50,365 --> 00:32:54,285
Speaker 2:  do have to ask how has the last six months or so

538
00:32:54,635 --> 00:32:57,205
Speaker 2:  been in terms of getting products?

539
00:32:57,675 --> 00:33:01,485
Speaker 6:  It's all I can do to keep smiling. It's been, it's been horrific.

540
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:06,045
Speaker 6:  Oh it, it is just, I feel bad as I talk

541
00:33:06,045 --> 00:33:09,645
Speaker 6:  to other, particularly small businesses like mine. I mean we're not that

542
00:33:09,645 --> 00:33:12,565
Speaker 6:  small but we're still small compared to some of the, the big companies out

543
00:33:12,565 --> 00:33:16,405
Speaker 6:  there. It, it's tough 'cause you can't plan, I don't, I don't know from

544
00:33:16,405 --> 00:33:19,165
Speaker 6:  one day to the other what's gonna happen. So it sound a little bit of a,

545
00:33:20,005 --> 00:33:23,485
Speaker 6:  a kink in, in my plans for this year. 'cause I, I want it to be more

546
00:33:23,485 --> 00:33:27,045
Speaker 6:  aggressively marketing and things And I, you know, right now I'm just focused

547
00:33:27,045 --> 00:33:30,365
Speaker 6:  on getting product back in and solving some of those kind of problems. But

548
00:33:30,785 --> 00:33:34,525
Speaker 6:  we do have plans for a big relaunch of the brand

549
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:35,765
Speaker 6:  and company still this year.

550
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:40,605
Speaker 2:  I know Insteon was an original launch partner with Apple HomeKit, but as

551
00:33:40,645 --> 00:33:43,445
Speaker 2:  I understand it doesn't work with Apple anymore.

552
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:47,525
Speaker 2:  Correct. So obviously right now in the Smart Home Matter

553
00:33:48,105 --> 00:33:51,845
Speaker 2:  and Thread, which is another protocol that can be used for

554
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:56,045
Speaker 2:  lighting is kind of the the hot new thing. Is

555
00:33:56,045 --> 00:33:59,565
Speaker 2:  it some is matter something that Inste is, is looking at because that would

556
00:33:59,565 --> 00:34:01,085
Speaker 2:  help with interoperability?

557
00:34:01,425 --> 00:34:04,765
Speaker 6:  No, absolutely. And, and matter's an interesting,

558
00:34:05,425 --> 00:34:09,085
Speaker 6:  you know, capability and we'll be adding matter capability.

559
00:34:09,135 --> 00:34:12,525
Speaker 6:  It'll be an interfacing into matter. One of the challenges is

560
00:34:13,025 --> 00:34:16,845
Speaker 6:  for matter products. 'cause they go across the, the hope is to go

561
00:34:16,845 --> 00:34:19,365
Speaker 6:  across multiple manufacturers, But that means you have to bring the feature

562
00:34:19,545 --> 00:34:23,085
Speaker 6:  set down to lowest common denominators. So I think what we're gonna see,

563
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:27,045
Speaker 6:  for the most part, you're gonna see the, you know, the, the lutron's,

564
00:34:27,045 --> 00:34:30,485
Speaker 6:  the in stones, whatever, they're gonna continue to exist 'cause there's just

565
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,925
Speaker 6:  too, too many things you can do that you're not gonna be able to do with

566
00:34:32,925 --> 00:34:36,765
Speaker 6:  matter. But you'll have an interface into matter so that

567
00:34:36,765 --> 00:34:40,645
Speaker 6:  you can then interconnect. And where the matter becomes is those people that

568
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:44,445
Speaker 6:  are gonna develop the apps to really be able to control the home. So that,

569
00:34:44,445 --> 00:34:48,005
Speaker 6:  that's the other part of matters. Someone's gotta develop the app and if

570
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:51,845
Speaker 6:  you're not selling the hardware, then back to my thing, the matter apps

571
00:34:51,865 --> 00:34:54,365
Speaker 6:  are gonna have to be subscription based 'cause otherwise they don't have

572
00:34:54,365 --> 00:34:58,085
Speaker 6:  any revenue. But, and, and Apple and HomeKit. And I think that

573
00:34:58,085 --> 00:35:01,325
Speaker 6:  becomes important. So I plan, we'll we'll get back to

574
00:35:01,455 --> 00:35:04,605
Speaker 6:  connection with HomeKit. Is there Apple's now trying to get back into this

575
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:08,085
Speaker 6:  marketplace and we'll be there to support that. So we have plans

576
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:12,165
Speaker 6:  that's on the roadmap and under, In fact under work right now to be able

577
00:35:12,165 --> 00:35:14,325
Speaker 6:  to bring that, you know, that capability back in.

578
00:35:14,985 --> 00:35:18,885
Speaker 2:  So you were retired three years ago when you

579
00:35:18,885 --> 00:35:22,685
Speaker 2:  bought a smart home company. So what do you see as the future for the

580
00:35:22,685 --> 00:35:26,485
Speaker 2:  smart home company and your role in it? Are you in know, I'm sure you'd

581
00:35:26,485 --> 00:35:28,925
Speaker 2:  like to get back to the beach in Hawaii at some point.

582
00:35:30,065 --> 00:35:31,045
Speaker 6:  My wife certainly would.

583
00:35:33,475 --> 00:35:36,485
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Just so I, I'd like to see, you know, I'd like to see the, you know,

584
00:35:36,715 --> 00:35:40,645
Speaker 6:  next couple years it, the company double or triple in, in in size,

585
00:35:40,645 --> 00:35:44,325
Speaker 6:  which I think is very doable and makes it a nice sized business. You know,

586
00:35:44,325 --> 00:35:47,725
Speaker 6:  I've got a good team of people that they're taking more and more of a role

587
00:35:48,505 --> 00:35:51,725
Speaker 6:  in running the company, which is great. And I see that evolving and then

588
00:35:51,725 --> 00:35:55,325
Speaker 6:  someone taking, you know, my day-to-day kind of responsibilities and,

589
00:35:55,825 --> 00:35:59,605
Speaker 6:  and I'll kind of just, you know, go to maybe an advisory, you know, kinda

590
00:35:59,605 --> 00:36:03,445
Speaker 6:  level with the, with the company and, and help it continue to grow

591
00:36:03,445 --> 00:36:04,325
Speaker 6:  from that standpoint.

592
00:36:05,025 --> 00:36:09,005
Speaker 2:  Do you think it's possible that it would be a company that

593
00:36:09,005 --> 00:36:12,525
Speaker 2:  might get purchased? Like would you look to sell it or do you feel like it

594
00:36:12,525 --> 00:36:14,205
Speaker 2:  needs to stay in its own?

595
00:36:14,665 --> 00:36:18,445
Speaker 6:  No, I I I think that would be certainly open to do it to the right people

596
00:36:18,475 --> 00:36:22,445
Speaker 6:  that really, yeah, my commitment is to the customers And I, yeah. If I felt

597
00:36:22,445 --> 00:36:26,405
Speaker 6:  someone had a passion and, and, and like I said, the team, yes

598
00:36:26,405 --> 00:36:29,325
Speaker 6:  they do it for a salary, but that's not why they're doing it. They're doing

599
00:36:29,325 --> 00:36:33,165
Speaker 6:  it 'cause they really care about the customers. I know it sounds corny and

600
00:36:33,165 --> 00:36:36,805
Speaker 6:  it, you know, it's hard to believe, but it really is true. Everyone really

601
00:36:36,805 --> 00:36:39,685
Speaker 6:  wants to do and really cares about the customer. So if I could find some

602
00:36:39,685 --> 00:36:43,445
Speaker 6:  of that same passion and they're willing to continue to thoughtfully

603
00:36:43,445 --> 00:36:46,925
Speaker 6:  grow the company, then I'd be happy to step back some and let a younger person,

604
00:36:47,025 --> 00:36:50,805
Speaker 6:  so to speak, you know, take on the role I have. But

605
00:36:50,805 --> 00:36:54,285
Speaker 6:  that's the, the critical part to it. So next couple years, you know, hopefully

606
00:36:55,065 --> 00:36:56,325
Speaker 6:  I'm gonna be able to do that.

607
00:36:56,755 --> 00:36:59,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah, yeah. Well, And I guess, you know, the reason I ask that question is

608
00:36:59,805 --> 00:37:02,845
Speaker 2:  because Insteon users have obviously been through a lot.

609
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:07,485
Speaker 2:  So what is their kind of reassurance here that this isn't gonna happen

610
00:37:07,495 --> 00:37:11,405
Speaker 2:  again? Why should they stay committed to the company? Why should new

611
00:37:11,405 --> 00:37:15,245
Speaker 2:  people invest in product from Insteon? What's kind of

612
00:37:15,255 --> 00:37:18,885
Speaker 2:  assurances, can Insteon offer that this isn't gonna happen again? Is there

613
00:37:19,275 --> 00:37:23,205
Speaker 2:  some kind of open source option for the technology so that they would have

614
00:37:23,205 --> 00:37:26,645
Speaker 2:  options if this happened again? Or are you just a hundred percent sure this

615
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:28,245
Speaker 2:  is not gonna happen again?

616
00:37:28,945 --> 00:37:30,285
Speaker 6:  I'm a hundred percent sure

617
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:35,725
Speaker 6:  I, I'm, I'm really committed to, like they said, yes. I mean, I think what

618
00:37:35,725 --> 00:37:39,485
Speaker 6:  the previous company did, they could have as an example. They, they

619
00:37:39,485 --> 00:37:42,645
Speaker 6:  could have started a subscription and kept all the hubs working. If that

620
00:37:42,645 --> 00:37:45,965
Speaker 6:  was, it was a cash flow issue, why you didn't do that, I don't understand

621
00:37:47,235 --> 00:37:50,445
Speaker 6:  that could have kept things going. You certainly could license the technology

622
00:37:50,445 --> 00:37:54,045
Speaker 6:  of the products out to somebody else from that standpoint

623
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:58,485
Speaker 6:  and, and barring some other unforeseen circumstance. I mean, you know,

624
00:37:58,595 --> 00:38:02,445
Speaker 6:  tariffs going to 400% and no one wants to pay for the product. I

625
00:38:02,525 --> 00:38:06,045
Speaker 6:  I, I see a bright future for the company. And, and again, it's

626
00:38:06,045 --> 00:38:10,005
Speaker 6:  transparency. I mean, and that's my commitment. And I, In

627
00:38:10,005 --> 00:38:13,245
Speaker 6:  fact, I have it over here in the desk here, our values and, and the first

628
00:38:13,295 --> 00:38:17,165
Speaker 6:  value here is transparency to the customer base. Yeah. And telling 'em what's

629
00:38:17,165 --> 00:38:20,285
Speaker 6:  going on and not hiding from them. Let 'em, let 'em know and assuring them

630
00:38:20,815 --> 00:38:24,805
Speaker 6:  we're profitable, we're making a profit. Haven't had to put money into

631
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:28,525
Speaker 6:  the company or not extended in any financial

632
00:38:28,525 --> 00:38:31,525
Speaker 6:  shape. And so that's the commitment. But I, I think that's for all of it.

633
00:38:31,525 --> 00:38:35,365
Speaker 6:  And I'm trying to be accessible too. I mean, I, I

634
00:38:35,365 --> 00:38:39,085
Speaker 6:  take phone calls, I call customers back, which I think is important because

635
00:38:39,465 --> 00:38:43,165
Speaker 6:  that's how you get to hear what's really going on. It's always,

636
00:38:43,235 --> 00:38:46,845
Speaker 6:  it's always amazing to me when I call a customer And I just say, this is

637
00:38:46,845 --> 00:38:49,645
Speaker 6:  Ken from nc, I saw your email and whatever. I just wanted to learn a little

638
00:38:49,645 --> 00:38:52,645
Speaker 6:  bit more about what it, it's, it's funny to see their reaction when they

639
00:38:52,645 --> 00:38:56,565
Speaker 6:  go, wait, wait a minute. You're the ken that sends out the Ken emails.

640
00:38:56,585 --> 00:39:00,525
Speaker 6:  You're the, that's you. I go, yeah. Oh my gosh, I'm sorry to take your time.

641
00:39:00,645 --> 00:39:04,605
Speaker 6:  I go, no, no, that's, this is, I learned this at Hewlett Packard. You gotta

642
00:39:04,605 --> 00:39:08,165
Speaker 6:  talk to your customers. The CEO of HP would do the same thing. And he, that's

643
00:39:08,165 --> 00:39:11,405
Speaker 6:  what he taught me. You gotta talk to the customers, you, you'll get hidden

644
00:39:11,435 --> 00:39:14,885
Speaker 6:  from the truth of what's going on. So I said, you guys are doing me a service

645
00:39:15,065 --> 00:39:17,685
Speaker 6:  by telling me what's on your mind and what's concerning you.

646
00:39:18,115 --> 00:39:21,645
Speaker 2:  Yeah, yeah. Well it's been a journey for you, Ken,

647
00:39:22,745 --> 00:39:26,045
Speaker 2:  and I'm really glad that you could come on and, and talk us through it. It,

648
00:39:26,045 --> 00:39:29,485
Speaker 2:  it really does kind of shed a light on the whole industry in a way and help,

649
00:39:29,685 --> 00:39:33,485
Speaker 2:  I think hopefully help people understand what's happening in this industry

650
00:39:33,485 --> 00:39:37,365
Speaker 2:  and how hopefully things are looking up. Because

651
00:39:37,365 --> 00:39:40,605
Speaker 2:  smart lighting really does make a big difference. I know in my family, when

652
00:39:40,605 --> 00:39:43,325
Speaker 2:  we go to a hotel or something, my husband's like a Alexa, turn the lights

653
00:39:43,325 --> 00:39:47,125
Speaker 2:  off. I'm like, it's not gonna work here hun. It's something, it is

654
00:39:47,205 --> 00:39:51,085
Speaker 2:  a luxury, but it is one of those luxuries that becomes a necessity and, and

655
00:39:51,085 --> 00:39:54,845
Speaker 2:  really does add a lot of value. So I'm glad to see that you were able

656
00:39:54,905 --> 00:39:58,725
Speaker 2:  to, to bring Insteon back and what's, what's next for the company. I

657
00:39:58,725 --> 00:40:02,485
Speaker 2:  understand you've recently relaunched the website for Insteon

658
00:40:02,805 --> 00:40:06,445
Speaker 2:  rebranded. So just tell us a little bit about what's changed and what the

659
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:09,365
Speaker 2:  future is here for the technology and the product.

660
00:40:10,515 --> 00:40:13,605
Speaker 6:  Well, I think with the, the rebranding of the company, you'll see a new logo

661
00:40:13,675 --> 00:40:17,325
Speaker 6:  from us, which really reflects the values of the company and how we're moving

662
00:40:17,325 --> 00:40:21,045
Speaker 6:  forward. So I encourage everyone to go check it out. The website is a

663
00:40:21,325 --> 00:40:21,485
Speaker 6:  complete

664
00:41:00,565 --> 00:41:04,445
Speaker 2:  a supersized Vergecast Hotline where I will be joined by

665
00:41:04,605 --> 00:41:07,045
Speaker 2:  a special guest and we'll be answering

666
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:50,585
Speaker 2:  We are back And I have a very special guest with me for

667
00:42:50,745 --> 00:42:54,705
Speaker 2:  a very special, super sized extended Vergecast Hotline

668
00:42:54,715 --> 00:42:58,305
Speaker 2:  where we answer all your burning questions about smart lighting.

669
00:42:58,895 --> 00:43:02,705
Speaker 2:  Richard Gunther is going to join me to help answer a whole bunch of questions

670
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:06,225
Speaker 2:  on this topic, which is a topic I get asked about all the time

671
00:43:07,005 --> 00:43:10,185
Speaker 2:  and it's kind of a hard one to write about unless I was gonna write like

672
00:43:10,185 --> 00:43:13,905
Speaker 2:  a 5,000 word essay, right? Because everyone's home setups

673
00:43:14,045 --> 00:43:17,625
Speaker 2:  are so unique. So I thought one of the best ways to help

674
00:43:18,085 --> 00:43:22,065
Speaker 2:  all of you out was to get the guy I go to when I have questions

675
00:43:22,065 --> 00:43:25,705
Speaker 2:  about smart lighting on to help me answer all of your

676
00:43:25,945 --> 00:43:29,705
Speaker 2:  questions. So a quick bit of background on Richard. He's a

677
00:43:29,705 --> 00:43:33,665
Speaker 2:  blogger and podcaster and the host of three shows, The Smart Home

678
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:37,265
Speaker 2:  Show, home on and Entertainment 2.0

679
00:43:37,965 --> 00:43:41,785
Speaker 2:  and he's obsessed with smart lighting. Fair enough. Plus his day job

680
00:43:41,845 --> 00:43:45,665
Speaker 2:  is as a product experience consultant. So

681
00:43:45,695 --> 00:43:49,305
Speaker 2:  it's like literally his job to make things easier to use. So

682
00:43:49,655 --> 00:43:51,985
Speaker 2:  welcome Richard, and thank you for joining me.

683
00:43:52,805 --> 00:43:56,665
Speaker 10:  I'm very glad to be here. I always love talking about lighting

684
00:43:56,665 --> 00:43:57,865
Speaker 10:  perhaps a little bit too much.

685
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:02,305
Speaker 2:  Great. Okay, so I'm gonna, we have a like quite a lot of questions

686
00:44:02,465 --> 00:44:05,425
Speaker 2:  here. I'm not sure how many we'll get through, but we're gonna kick it off

687
00:44:05,425 --> 00:44:09,105
Speaker 2:  with one that seems deceptively easy, which is

688
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:12,945
Speaker 2:  quite a common theme here. It's like, oh but surely that's simple.

689
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:17,905
Speaker 2:  Anyway, okay, so the first one is from Cole Kennedy and

690
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:21,865
Speaker 2:  his question is, I've always wanted to have my lights

691
00:44:22,645 --> 00:44:26,585
Speaker 2:  gently, gradually brighten in the morning. Any idea if

692
00:44:26,585 --> 00:44:30,265
Speaker 2:  this is possible via home kit or do I have to create it

693
00:44:30,565 --> 00:44:34,525
Speaker 2:  in the Hue app? Basically I really want an

694
00:44:34,595 --> 00:44:37,725
Speaker 2:  exploration on how others automate their lights.

695
00:44:38,595 --> 00:44:40,365
Speaker 2:  Well, Cole, you've come to the right place.

696
00:44:41,915 --> 00:44:45,805
Speaker 10:  It's funny, for the most part, most of the big ecosystems

697
00:44:45,895 --> 00:44:49,765
Speaker 10:  don't just support this natively. So if you're thinking about

698
00:44:49,765 --> 00:44:53,645
Speaker 10:  your home app on either Google or Apple, this isn't

699
00:44:53,645 --> 00:44:57,605
Speaker 10:  something they just have available that you can do. You usually need the

700
00:44:57,635 --> 00:45:01,445
Speaker 10:  product's own app to do this. Hue does have a

701
00:45:01,445 --> 00:45:05,325
Speaker 10:  mechanism for doing this and, and a routine, or I think it was a

702
00:45:05,345 --> 00:45:09,205
Speaker 10:  lab for a while where they would allow you to set

703
00:45:09,425 --> 00:45:12,845
Speaker 10:  at the length of time that you wanted the light to come on the color,

704
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:17,325
Speaker 10:  stuff like that. And you know, it, it could be up to say

705
00:45:17,385 --> 00:45:21,085
Speaker 10:  30 minutes time. I wake up a little bit faster

706
00:45:21,555 --> 00:45:25,445
Speaker 10:  than that. I used to do this in my home 10 years ago or more

707
00:45:26,035 --> 00:45:29,845
Speaker 10:  with basic Insteon products. This is something that Insteon had built

708
00:45:30,155 --> 00:45:33,845
Speaker 10:  into their solution right from the beginning that you could have

709
00:45:34,185 --> 00:45:37,605
Speaker 10:  it take up to eight minutes for a light to come on to full,

710
00:45:37,975 --> 00:45:41,845
Speaker 10:  which is enough to, it gets you past that jolt of

711
00:45:42,095 --> 00:45:45,205
Speaker 10:  light in the morning. If you have the lights automate automatically.

712
00:45:46,025 --> 00:45:48,845
Speaker 10:  But I think generally you're gonna find that for the most part, you need

713
00:45:48,845 --> 00:45:52,485
Speaker 10:  to rely on a manufacturer's own app to do this.

714
00:45:53,365 --> 00:45:56,965
Speaker 10:  Recently you posted how the newer hub from

715
00:45:57,275 --> 00:45:59,005
Speaker 10:  ikea, And I always get this wrong, I think it's,

716
00:45:59,745 --> 00:46:02,405
Speaker 2:  I'm going with whatever you wanna say 'cause I'm not even gonna try,

717
00:46:03,185 --> 00:46:06,565
Speaker 10:  Is going to work as basically a matter controller

718
00:46:06,985 --> 00:46:10,605
Speaker 10:  and IKEA is one of the systems that has this capability.

719
00:46:11,105 --> 00:46:14,645
Speaker 10:  So there's a possibility, we don't know this yet, but there's a possibility

720
00:46:14,915 --> 00:46:18,685
Speaker 10:  that the IKEA hub could do this for other

721
00:46:18,685 --> 00:46:20,325
Speaker 10:  lights in your home, which would be really cool.

722
00:46:20,755 --> 00:46:24,525
Speaker 2:  That would 'cause that is the main frustration with this right now is that

723
00:46:24,905 --> 00:46:28,725
Speaker 2:  yes, the answer to his question is you do have to use the Hue app

724
00:46:28,825 --> 00:46:32,205
Speaker 2:  to do this. Apple Home doesn't support it yet, which is

725
00:46:32,725 --> 00:46:35,605
Speaker 2:  frustrating and surprising. You would expect this to be something you could

726
00:46:35,605 --> 00:46:39,245
Speaker 2:  do. Apple Home does have adaptive lighting, which is that

727
00:46:39,885 --> 00:46:43,045
Speaker 2:  changing the light throughout the day. Right? But it's not the same thing

728
00:46:43,065 --> 00:46:46,965
Speaker 2:  as gradually turning on in the morning. Right? It's just changing the tone

729
00:46:47,065 --> 00:46:50,725
Speaker 2:  of the light. Exactly. It doesn't adjust the brightness, it just changed

730
00:46:50,745 --> 00:46:54,725
Speaker 2:  the tone. Yep. Which is, it seems like a a small thing you would

731
00:46:54,985 --> 00:46:58,685
Speaker 2:  and one day maybe Apple Home will support this, but yeah, it's frustrating

732
00:46:58,685 --> 00:47:02,485
Speaker 2:  that you have to stick with one brand. And this is something I've come across

733
00:47:02,485 --> 00:47:06,085
Speaker 2:  because I love using this feature for my kids to get them

734
00:47:06,275 --> 00:47:10,245
Speaker 2:  sort of going in the morning, like slowly turn the lights on. And

735
00:47:10,265 --> 00:47:13,805
Speaker 2:  so I just have, I've defaulted to having HU bulbs in their rooms because

736
00:47:13,805 --> 00:47:17,045
Speaker 2:  they're the ones that do this best. There are other bulbs that do it, but

737
00:47:17,045 --> 00:47:20,965
Speaker 2:  again, you're always gonna have to be with one ecosystem, which with

738
00:47:21,165 --> 00:47:25,045
Speaker 2:  lighting as we will discuss, gets complicated. You don't really want to

739
00:47:25,045 --> 00:47:28,885
Speaker 2:  be locked into one brand. It does. And yeah, this is exciting

740
00:47:29,105 --> 00:47:33,035
Speaker 2:  with the whole, the new Matter controller feature coming to more

741
00:47:33,265 --> 00:47:36,915
Speaker 2:  hubs and potentially being able to use the features that are more

742
00:47:37,235 --> 00:47:41,155
Speaker 2:  specific to the what you want to do in the smart home. I mean, IKEA is very

743
00:47:41,155 --> 00:47:44,675
Speaker 2:  much focused around lighting, so this is something they offer. So I'll be

744
00:47:44,675 --> 00:47:48,355
Speaker 2:  really interested to see if that's gonna be possible because In theory

745
00:47:48,355 --> 00:47:51,675
Speaker 2:  you'll be able to connect any matter compatible light bulb to the

746
00:47:52,265 --> 00:47:56,155
Speaker 2:  IKEA hub and then set whatever routines and options it

747
00:47:56,155 --> 00:47:59,995
Speaker 2:  offers on those bulbs. So yeah, stay tuned. This may

748
00:47:59,995 --> 00:48:00,395
Speaker 2:  get easier

749
00:48:01,105 --> 00:48:01,715
Speaker 10:  Hopefully.

750
00:48:01,865 --> 00:48:05,635
Speaker 2:  Okay, so because Cole, you did ask how others

751
00:48:05,995 --> 00:48:09,955
Speaker 2:  automate their lights, we are gonna do a quick rundown of how Richard

752
00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:13,835
Speaker 2:  And I automate our lights in our homes. So Richard,

753
00:48:15,015 --> 00:48:18,595
Speaker 2:  why don't you go ahead and give us a kind of rundown on what you have set

754
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:21,875
Speaker 2:  up and why. Yeah, why is always the kind of interesting part. I think it

755
00:48:22,235 --> 00:48:25,875
Speaker 10:  It is, it is. So I'm primarily focused around HomeKit.

756
00:48:26,545 --> 00:48:30,355
Speaker 10:  When HomeKit became more robust, I moved away

757
00:48:30,465 --> 00:48:34,035
Speaker 10:  from Amazon as my ecosystem and

758
00:48:34,385 --> 00:48:38,075
Speaker 10:  primarily worked with HomeKit. Now, before I used to have all different

759
00:48:38,075 --> 00:48:40,675
Speaker 10:  apps controlling a bunch of different stuff and I've always been an advocate

760
00:48:40,675 --> 00:48:43,995
Speaker 10:  for trying to get things on the same platform if you can.

761
00:48:44,535 --> 00:48:48,275
Speaker 10:  And now home kit's pretty good for that, but there are still

762
00:48:48,555 --> 00:48:52,435
Speaker 10:  a few holdouts companies like Ring and some others

763
00:48:52,485 --> 00:48:56,435
Speaker 10:  still don't offer devices that work

764
00:48:56,435 --> 00:48:59,435
Speaker 10:  necessarily directly with Home Kits. So I also use HomeBridge,

765
00:49:00,165 --> 00:49:04,035
Speaker 10:  which is one of those things where, you know, bake your own raspberry

766
00:49:04,295 --> 00:49:08,075
Speaker 10:  pie server or throw it on a NAS that you have in your

767
00:49:08,275 --> 00:49:11,995
Speaker 10:  basement or something like that. If you're that much of a geek and it

768
00:49:12,025 --> 00:49:15,835
Speaker 10:  lets you connect some things to Home Git that otherwise wouldn't be accessible.

769
00:49:16,375 --> 00:49:20,235
Speaker 10:  So I use that and all of my scenes and all of

770
00:49:20,255 --> 00:49:23,315
Speaker 10:  my automations are through HomeKit.

771
00:49:23,415 --> 00:49:27,155
Speaker 2:  You, you run everything on HomeKit, which is using the home app on your iPhone

772
00:49:27,355 --> 00:49:27,475
Speaker 2:  U,

773
00:49:27,475 --> 00:49:31,275
Speaker 10:  Using the Apple home ecosystem primarily with the home app.

774
00:49:31,275 --> 00:49:34,835
Speaker 10:  That's what I use as my day-to-day. But my secret

775
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:38,875
Speaker 10:  sauce to setting this all up is a lesser known

776
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:42,755
Speaker 10:  app called Controller for HomeKit. This is an independent

777
00:49:42,785 --> 00:49:46,715
Speaker 10:  developer's app that ties into your Apple home

778
00:49:46,715 --> 00:49:49,915
Speaker 10:  ecosystem and lets you see and control

779
00:49:50,695 --> 00:49:54,035
Speaker 10:  far more about your Apple Home devices

780
00:49:54,785 --> 00:49:57,995
Speaker 10:  than Apple's own home app does.

781
00:49:58,495 --> 00:49:59,395
Speaker 2:  Ah, right. Yeah.

782
00:49:59,775 --> 00:50:03,395
Speaker 10:  So Apple's about making stuff simple, so they hide a lot of stuff.

783
00:50:04,225 --> 00:50:07,715
Speaker 10:  This app Controller for HomeKit helps you see

784
00:50:08,015 --> 00:50:11,795
Speaker 10:  all those other facets or attributes of your

785
00:50:11,795 --> 00:50:15,035
Speaker 10:  devices, which could be things like ramp rate,

786
00:50:15,615 --> 00:50:19,515
Speaker 10:  for example. The Leviton switches allow you to

787
00:50:19,515 --> 00:50:23,195
Speaker 10:  adjust how long, how many seconds it takes for

788
00:50:23,675 --> 00:50:27,605
Speaker 10:  a light to come on when you flip that switch or when you start a scene

789
00:50:27,605 --> 00:50:31,485
Speaker 10:  with it. And you could set that with, in the case of Levitin switches up

790
00:50:31,485 --> 00:50:34,765
Speaker 10:  to 25 seconds. It's not an enormous amount of time,

791
00:50:35,305 --> 00:50:38,885
Speaker 10:  But that flexibility is really nice and has its uses for

792
00:50:39,645 --> 00:50:43,325
Speaker 10:  different seams. The lighting control in my house is

793
00:50:43,325 --> 00:50:47,205
Speaker 10:  largely done through switches and for that I have a

794
00:50:47,205 --> 00:50:50,645
Speaker 10:  combination of Leviton switches, keypads,

795
00:50:51,235 --> 00:50:54,405
Speaker 10:  dimmers. They have a really

796
00:50:54,995 --> 00:50:58,965
Speaker 10:  good motion dimmer one of the few in

797
00:50:58,965 --> 00:51:02,405
Speaker 10:  the market where you can get a smart dimmer with a motion sensor built into

798
00:51:02,405 --> 00:51:06,005
Speaker 10:  it and either use them together or independently. I love that

799
00:51:06,705 --> 00:51:10,005
Speaker 10:  Lutron is an old stalwart in the

800
00:51:10,315 --> 00:51:14,205
Speaker 10:  community and And I heavily rely on their stuff. I've also

801
00:51:14,385 --> 00:51:18,005
Speaker 10:  tested and reviewed a bunch of their things. I have some

802
00:51:18,265 --> 00:51:22,125
Speaker 10:  in Ave matter based switches. Inav is a third party

803
00:51:22,315 --> 00:51:26,165
Speaker 10:  that creates switches for systems that are

804
00:51:26,215 --> 00:51:29,925
Speaker 10:  compatible with matter or compatible with ZigBee or Z-Wave.

805
00:51:30,065 --> 00:51:33,685
Speaker 10:  And I also have some Insteon switches

806
00:51:33,835 --> 00:51:37,485
Speaker 10:  through my home. I've had Insteon stuff for years and years

807
00:51:38,105 --> 00:51:41,925
Speaker 10:  and while it doesn't tie into everything else that I use

808
00:51:41,925 --> 00:51:45,245
Speaker 10:  right now, it's really good for point solutions.

809
00:51:45,745 --> 00:51:49,325
Speaker 10:  So for example, I have closets with indoor

810
00:51:49,505 --> 00:51:53,405
Speaker 10:  closet door sensors that as soon as I

811
00:51:53,405 --> 00:51:56,765
Speaker 10:  open the closet door, the light inside the closet goes on

812
00:51:57,465 --> 00:52:01,165
Speaker 10:  and things like that are really helpful for being able to remember

813
00:52:01,545 --> 00:52:04,805
Speaker 10:  not to leave a light on if you have a light in your closet or something

814
00:52:04,805 --> 00:52:08,765
Speaker 10:  like that. Now, for lighting bulbs, color

815
00:52:08,965 --> 00:52:12,405
Speaker 10:  lighting in particular, I think it was you, I think I can blame you Jen,

816
00:52:12,585 --> 00:52:16,365
Speaker 10:  for getting me hooked on the cube play sink

817
00:52:16,785 --> 00:52:20,725
Speaker 10:  system. Ah, which is the mechanism

818
00:52:20,865 --> 00:52:24,765
Speaker 10:  for synchronizing the lights in a room with

819
00:52:24,765 --> 00:52:28,365
Speaker 10:  either what you're seeing on your TV or on your computer

820
00:52:28,785 --> 00:52:32,605
Speaker 10:  or music that's playing. It allows you to synchronize video

821
00:52:33,035 --> 00:52:36,525
Speaker 10:  with ambient color throughout a room. So in my family room

822
00:52:37,405 --> 00:52:41,205
Speaker 10:  I have a bunch of those hooked up to my TV And

823
00:52:41,365 --> 00:52:45,325
Speaker 10:  I also have a, a bunch of outdoor accent lighting from

824
00:52:45,355 --> 00:52:49,325
Speaker 10:  Hugh 'cause they are one of the few vendors that came out early

825
00:52:49,435 --> 00:52:50,325
Speaker 10:  with outdoor lighting.

826
00:52:51,025 --> 00:52:55,005
Speaker 2:  So how do you make everything work? Like are you doing

827
00:52:55,125 --> 00:52:58,685
Speaker 2:  like motion sensors, routines, schedules,

828
00:52:59,185 --> 00:53:02,405
Speaker 2:  you know that that's kind of, that's always the tricky part. It is. Of the

829
00:53:02,405 --> 00:53:05,765
Speaker 2:  smart lighting, it's the motion sensors seem like the solution but they are

830
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:06,645
Speaker 2:  not always Yep.

831
00:53:07,145 --> 00:53:10,565
Speaker 10:  No, that, that's exactly right. So, you know, I mentioned motion sensors,

832
00:53:10,795 --> 00:53:14,685
Speaker 10:  they work in certain cases. I use motion sensors in places

833
00:53:15,195 --> 00:53:18,685
Speaker 10:  like my pantry and my laundry room. Yeah.

834
00:53:18,825 --> 00:53:22,725
Speaker 10:  Places that I'm gonna be walking in and out of where my hands might be full

835
00:53:23,145 --> 00:53:26,965
Speaker 10:  And I don't wanna have to think about whether the light is on or not.

836
00:53:27,035 --> 00:53:30,885
Speaker 10:  It's just gonna happen automatically. Same with some closets.

837
00:53:31,505 --> 00:53:35,165
Speaker 10:  My primary bedroom closet for example, has a motion

838
00:53:35,165 --> 00:53:38,845
Speaker 10:  sensor in it. I think that works in

839
00:53:39,035 --> 00:53:42,805
Speaker 10:  some cases, not in others. There's sometimes where

840
00:53:43,075 --> 00:53:46,925
Speaker 10:  it's hard to tune a motion sensor or have a motion

841
00:53:46,925 --> 00:53:50,815
Speaker 10:  sensor in the right place to be able to turn

842
00:53:50,815 --> 00:53:54,375
Speaker 10:  lights on. So I use that mostly for utility

843
00:53:54,595 --> 00:53:58,215
Speaker 10:  spaces. Sometimes I even have just dumb switches with motion

844
00:53:58,215 --> 00:54:01,095
Speaker 10:  sensors built into them for like my utility room.

845
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:05,775
Speaker 10:  Or we have a storage room that has a light in it as well.

846
00:54:06,255 --> 00:54:09,695
Speaker 10:  I don't need anything fancy for that. I don't, it doesn't matter if I can

847
00:54:09,695 --> 00:54:13,415
Speaker 10:  monitor whether that light is on or not. So I can just use

848
00:54:13,575 --> 00:54:16,735
Speaker 10:  a plain old motion light for stuff like that. Elsewhere

849
00:54:17,515 --> 00:54:20,735
Speaker 10:  in the house though, I, I do need things like

850
00:54:21,055 --> 00:54:24,895
Speaker 10:  routines for lighting to come on at night or

851
00:54:25,225 --> 00:54:29,215
Speaker 10:  maybe off in the morning or off when we go to bed. I have a

852
00:54:29,215 --> 00:54:33,095
Speaker 10:  go to bed routine where I constantly hear from Siri

853
00:54:33,095 --> 00:54:37,055
Speaker 10:  telling me that she wasn't able to turn something that I had asked

854
00:54:38,075 --> 00:54:38,295
Speaker 10:  off.

855
00:54:39,235 --> 00:54:39,655
Speaker 2:  Always.

856
00:54:39,655 --> 00:54:40,855
Speaker 10:  There's always something.

857
00:54:41,435 --> 00:54:45,335
Speaker 2:  So you just say when you, you you go, Hey s right, it's

858
00:54:45,335 --> 00:54:46,135
Speaker 2:  time to go to bed or

859
00:54:46,135 --> 00:54:48,935
Speaker 10:  Goodnight or I'm going to bed or, it's very flexible. Okay. Then it triggers

860
00:54:48,935 --> 00:54:52,175
Speaker 10:  in what you can say triggers Exactly. Yeah. And, and then that triggers

861
00:54:52,855 --> 00:54:56,695
Speaker 10:  a good night scene for me and that good night

862
00:54:56,695 --> 00:55:00,415
Speaker 10:  scene I'm constantly updating. 'cause every time I

863
00:55:00,555 --> 00:55:04,375
Speaker 10:  add a new device I usually wanna make sure that that's also a part of

864
00:55:04,375 --> 00:55:07,815
Speaker 10:  what I'm turning off at night. Right. I also

865
00:55:08,235 --> 00:55:12,055
Speaker 10:  do have a, a couple of scenes and automations

866
00:55:12,065 --> 00:55:15,895
Speaker 10:  where we just have lights come on, whether we're home or not, just

867
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:18,775
Speaker 10:  to make it look like we're home for security purposes.

868
00:55:19,195 --> 00:55:22,775
Speaker 2:  Oh, security things. Yeah. That's great. And that, do you automate all of

869
00:55:22,775 --> 00:55:23,975
Speaker 2:  this through Apple or

870
00:55:23,975 --> 00:55:25,335
Speaker 10:  You All of it through Apple. Yep.

871
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:29,415
Speaker 2:  Do you also use buttons at all so that you don't have to use voice control?

872
00:55:29,475 --> 00:55:33,455
Speaker 10:  Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I, I'm, I'm a big, big proponent

873
00:55:33,595 --> 00:55:36,735
Speaker 10:  of physical controls. Yeah. There isn't any

874
00:55:37,305 --> 00:55:41,015
Speaker 10:  light in my house that can't somehow be controlled with a button

875
00:55:41,015 --> 00:55:44,775
Speaker 10:  somewhere or a switch somewhere. I'm a big fan of keypads.

876
00:55:45,185 --> 00:55:48,615
Speaker 10:  We're starting to see companies come out with

877
00:55:48,725 --> 00:55:52,375
Speaker 10:  keypads that can be programmed to trigger a scene. That's a, a great

878
00:55:52,795 --> 00:55:56,175
Speaker 10:  use. I, I have a keypad for example in my

879
00:55:56,255 --> 00:55:59,935
Speaker 10:  butler's pantry. One for coffee time, one for drinking

880
00:56:00,045 --> 00:56:03,815
Speaker 10:  time, one for cleanup time and so

881
00:56:04,165 --> 00:56:07,895
Speaker 10:  Nice. Those are, those are very helpful to just get all the right lights

882
00:56:07,995 --> 00:56:11,095
Speaker 10:  on for the right use of the space.

883
00:56:11,885 --> 00:56:15,415
Speaker 2:  Okay. Well before we jump into my setup, is there anything else you wanted

884
00:56:15,415 --> 00:56:19,135
Speaker 2:  to call out that we hadn't mentioned about your setup? Well it sounds like

885
00:56:19,135 --> 00:56:23,055
Speaker 2:  you've got it pretty dialed in there. You feel like it's, it's working the

886
00:56:23,125 --> 00:56:26,845
Speaker 2:  way you want. Is it just tweaks for like when you add things or

887
00:56:26,905 --> 00:56:29,965
Speaker 2:  do you have any major issues that you're still trying to fix?

888
00:56:30,445 --> 00:56:34,005
Speaker 10:  I have occasional issues Every once in a while my

889
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:38,165
Speaker 10:  Hue devices don't want to fully behave on home kit

890
00:56:39,025 --> 00:56:42,685
Speaker 10:  and that's a pretty well known problem. You occasionally

891
00:56:42,835 --> 00:56:46,285
Speaker 10:  have to kind of disconnect them and reconnect them to home kit to make them

892
00:56:46,285 --> 00:56:50,205
Speaker 10:  work properly. So I have some problems with those. Every once

893
00:56:50,205 --> 00:56:54,165
Speaker 10:  in a while I'll just have a scene randomly stop working

894
00:56:54,305 --> 00:56:58,285
Speaker 10:  And I have to troubleshoot what's going on. Oftentimes it's wifi related

895
00:56:59,145 --> 00:57:02,965
Speaker 10:  and I did a recent episode of The Smart Home Show

896
00:57:03,175 --> 00:57:06,525
Speaker 10:  about using smart products on wifi

897
00:57:07,025 --> 00:57:10,285
Speaker 10:  and some of the ways you can avoid problems there. I should probably take

898
00:57:10,285 --> 00:57:11,325
Speaker 10:  some of my own advice

899
00:57:12,305 --> 00:57:15,805
Speaker 2:  And no, that was a great episode. I listened to it and we'll include it in

900
00:57:15,805 --> 00:57:19,485
Speaker 2:  the show notes because it's a real kind of, it starts with like wifi 1 0 1

901
00:57:19,505 --> 00:57:23,125
Speaker 2:  but then goes to like how to set up wifi for your smart home

902
00:57:23,725 --> 00:57:27,445
Speaker 2:  properly. So definitely listen to that. Excellent. Okay, great.

903
00:57:27,515 --> 00:57:31,485
Speaker 2:  Well I'm gonna just quickly run through mine because mine is

904
00:57:31,485 --> 00:57:35,325
Speaker 2:  pretty unusual and I'm mainly because, well I have two issues

905
00:57:35,595 --> 00:57:39,125
Speaker 2:  that make it different. One is I'm always testing new stuff so that

906
00:57:39,185 --> 00:57:42,685
Speaker 2:  throws everything out the window half the time in terms of

907
00:57:42,835 --> 00:57:46,805
Speaker 2:  automations and making things work smoothly. But the other big

908
00:57:46,805 --> 00:57:50,685
Speaker 2:  issue I have is I do not have neutral wires in most of

909
00:57:50,705 --> 00:57:54,645
Speaker 2:  my home. Ah. 'cause my home was built in the early

910
00:57:54,645 --> 00:57:58,325
Speaker 2:  sixties. I do have two rooms that were recently

911
00:57:58,355 --> 00:58:02,205
Speaker 2:  remodeled, which do have neutral wires. But this is a big issue

912
00:58:02,305 --> 00:58:05,565
Speaker 2:  in the smart home, especially if you want to use smart switches because they

913
00:58:05,675 --> 00:58:09,645
Speaker 2:  require a neutral wire. And there's all sorts of

914
00:58:09,645 --> 00:58:13,405
Speaker 2:  technical electrical details we could go into but I'll, I'll

915
00:58:13,405 --> 00:58:17,085
Speaker 2:  gloss over it for now. But basically there are very few smart

916
00:58:17,085 --> 00:58:20,965
Speaker 2:  switch lighting solutions that don't require neutral wires. There are a couple

917
00:58:21,345 --> 00:58:25,325
Speaker 2:  And I have tried them. One of them is from Leviton. I use that in my

918
00:58:25,485 --> 00:58:29,245
Speaker 2:  daughter's bathroom, but it requires a little bridge plugged

919
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:33,245
Speaker 2:  in nearby and that works relatively well. It's just an on off

920
00:58:33,245 --> 00:58:36,685
Speaker 2:  switch. And the reason I use it's 'cause she never turns her light off. So

921
00:58:36,685 --> 00:58:40,525
Speaker 2:  I have it set on a schedule through the Leviton app to turn off after an

922
00:58:40,525 --> 00:58:44,325
Speaker 2:  hour. Yep. Or I can also through smart home control, I can ask

923
00:58:44,345 --> 00:58:48,245
Speaker 2:  to turn it off because I can see it from the living room. So when I'm watching

924
00:58:48,245 --> 00:58:51,285
Speaker 2:  TV and the lights on up there, then I don't have to go all the way up the

925
00:58:51,285 --> 00:58:54,925
Speaker 2:  stairs. So those kind of like conveniences, that's one of the big things.

926
00:58:55,745 --> 00:58:59,205
Speaker 2:  The main thing I use smart lighting for in my house is that convenience.

927
00:58:59,205 --> 00:59:03,125
Speaker 2:  Especially from for the family's perspective because my house is

928
00:59:03,125 --> 00:59:07,085
Speaker 2:  quite open. So when we're sitting in the living room the, you know, hey

929
00:59:07,325 --> 00:59:11,285
Speaker 2:  s trigger movie time and we always, we still say trigger because

930
00:59:11,405 --> 00:59:15,205
Speaker 2:  I taught my husband years ago when we first

931
00:59:15,265 --> 00:59:18,925
Speaker 2:  got smart home devices, we had a wink hub and when it connected to

932
00:59:19,085 --> 00:59:23,005
Speaker 2:  Amazon's assistant you had to use the word trigger to

933
00:59:23,005 --> 00:59:26,685
Speaker 2:  get it to work. And he's been trained so well that he still

934
00:59:26,715 --> 00:59:29,525
Speaker 2:  uses that. You don't have to use that phrase but it's just funny that it's

935
00:59:29,525 --> 00:59:33,165
Speaker 2:  still there for him. But yeah, you know one using

936
00:59:33,625 --> 00:59:37,565
Speaker 2:  the words movie time to one of our smart assistants turns off all of

937
00:59:37,565 --> 00:59:41,285
Speaker 2:  the lights, dims a couple areas so that it's, we're not in pitch black.

938
00:59:41,545 --> 00:59:45,445
Speaker 2:  You know that those kind of solutions like your goodnight scene are what

939
00:59:45,445 --> 00:59:49,125
Speaker 2:  makes smart lighting so great for me. So my main

940
00:59:49,195 --> 00:59:53,085
Speaker 2:  control method like yours is Apple Home Kit. Primarily

941
00:59:53,085 --> 00:59:57,005
Speaker 2:  because I love the control center on iPhone. It's just so easy

942
00:59:57,555 --> 01:00:01,165
Speaker 2:  just being able to swipe down and hit a button to turn off a light

943
01:00:01,225 --> 01:00:05,005
Speaker 2:  rather than having to use voice. Voice is great for those routines and

944
01:00:05,005 --> 01:00:08,965
Speaker 2:  scenes but not for individual control so much. Right. We

945
01:00:08,965 --> 01:00:12,525
Speaker 2:  did use Amazon's assistant primarily for a long time

946
01:00:12,595 --> 01:00:16,125
Speaker 2:  because it worked with everything. But since

947
01:00:16,365 --> 01:00:20,245
Speaker 2:  matter I have got to the point where almost everything in my

948
01:00:20,275 --> 01:00:23,965
Speaker 2:  home currently can be controlled through Apple Home

949
01:00:23,965 --> 01:00:27,685
Speaker 2:  because of matter. So that, for example, my living room

950
01:00:27,685 --> 01:00:31,325
Speaker 2:  kitchen is all open plan. I have the Lutron Casser smart

951
01:00:31,565 --> 01:00:35,525
Speaker 2:  switches everywhere because of the neutral wire issue. That's

952
01:00:35,525 --> 01:00:39,365
Speaker 2:  the other brand that does not require a neutral wire. Right. So

953
01:00:39,475 --> 01:00:43,285
Speaker 2:  even though we remodeled our kitchen recently, but I still put Lutron

954
01:00:43,345 --> 01:00:47,165
Speaker 2:  in because I wanted to have the same switches. This is

955
01:00:47,165 --> 01:00:49,965
Speaker 2:  another thing you don't re, you know it's nice to have the same controls

956
01:00:50,545 --> 01:00:54,405
Speaker 2:  in all rooms of the home. So I have Lutron Casser smart switches 'cause they

957
01:00:54,405 --> 01:00:58,085
Speaker 2:  also control decorative light fixtures 'cause I wanted

958
01:00:58,635 --> 01:01:02,365
Speaker 2:  nice lights in my living room. I didn't want, oh this is actually in my kitchen.

959
01:01:02,605 --> 01:01:06,525
Speaker 2:  I have like gold pendant lights. Nice. Yeah. Yeah. Well they're brass

960
01:01:06,525 --> 01:01:10,325
Speaker 2:  kind of, you know, I wanted something sort of more interior designer

961
01:01:10,465 --> 01:01:14,165
Speaker 2:  and not like govi, no offense to Govi

962
01:01:14,585 --> 01:01:18,405
Speaker 2:  but you know those kind. I wanted something that looked nice in my kitchen.

963
01:01:18,455 --> 01:01:22,365
Speaker 2:  Right. Rather than the sort of RGB lights. And that's where you

964
01:01:22,365 --> 01:01:25,805
Speaker 2:  really do need to use smart switches. Even hue stuff. They have

965
01:01:25,885 --> 01:01:29,285
Speaker 2:  fixtures which are nice but they're still like black.

966
01:01:29,715 --> 01:01:33,445
Speaker 2:  There's very little kind of interior design happening

967
01:01:33,475 --> 01:01:35,485
Speaker 2:  with smart light fixtures, which is a shame.

968
01:01:35,635 --> 01:01:38,525
Speaker 10:  Very contemporary. Very Scandinavian.

969
01:01:38,905 --> 01:01:42,525
Speaker 2:  Yes, exactly. And then the one sort of

970
01:01:42,525 --> 01:01:46,245
Speaker 2:  exception to the rule I have in my kitchen is I have one Aqara H

971
01:01:46,305 --> 01:01:50,245
Speaker 2:  two dual switch which uses ZigBee or thread, which is interesting. You

972
01:01:50,245 --> 01:01:53,925
Speaker 2:  can choose between the two. Either one connects it to Apple home

973
01:01:54,385 --> 01:01:58,285
Speaker 2:  and it's a dual switch because the way my kitchen was wired,

974
01:01:58,605 --> 01:02:02,445
Speaker 2:  I have lights above my sink and under cabinet lightings that go

975
01:02:02,445 --> 01:02:06,405
Speaker 2:  into the same circuit and have to have, and

976
01:02:06,405 --> 01:02:09,725
Speaker 2:  there aren't very many smart switches out there that have that dual option.

977
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:10,165
Speaker 2:  True,

978
01:02:10,275 --> 01:02:14,005
Speaker 10:  True. 'cause in the old days that would just go to those small switches

979
01:02:14,035 --> 01:02:17,885
Speaker 10:  that would kind of stick through what would normally be used for an

980
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:21,885
Speaker 10:  electrical outlet. Right. And you just have one switch on top of the other.

981
01:02:22,295 --> 01:02:26,245
Speaker 10:  Those Aqara switches are beautiful spelt devices

982
01:02:26,475 --> 01:02:29,645
Speaker 10:  that are also incredibly powerful.

983
01:02:30,305 --> 01:02:34,085
Speaker 2:  One thing I really wanted for my under cabinet lighting was color

984
01:02:34,525 --> 01:02:38,445
Speaker 2:  lighting. And I wasn't able to do that because when I remodeled

985
01:02:38,445 --> 01:02:42,125
Speaker 2:  my kitchen there were no good options for hardwired

986
01:02:42,295 --> 01:02:46,205
Speaker 2:  under cabinet LED. Color changing lighting. There are

987
01:02:46,265 --> 01:02:50,245
Speaker 2:  now some GE sink has one. And then yeah so

988
01:02:50,245 --> 01:02:54,125
Speaker 2:  the living room is mainly bulbs. I have hue bulbs, well actually I just switched

989
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:57,525
Speaker 2:  them out. I have a CARA bulbs now in the living room.

990
01:02:58,205 --> 01:03:01,965
Speaker 2:  But thankfully those now work through matter. And then I have two

991
01:03:02,115 --> 01:03:06,085
Speaker 2:  dumb LED bulbs connected to a luteum casita switch.

992
01:03:06,725 --> 01:03:10,645
Speaker 2:  I have nano leaf panels on the wall And I have a Life X smart lamp for

993
01:03:10,645 --> 01:03:14,525
Speaker 2:  like ambient lighting. Again, everything there works now through Apple Home,

994
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:18,525
Speaker 2:  thanks to matter. Nice. And then the rest of the house, I

995
01:03:18,525 --> 01:03:22,285
Speaker 2:  mentioned my kids' bedrooms earlier, that's hue lighting. And then

996
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:26,125
Speaker 2:  my bedroom has dumb bad word, I'm sorry,

997
01:03:26,315 --> 01:03:30,285
Speaker 2:  non-smart LED eight can lights that are

998
01:03:30,485 --> 01:03:34,405
Speaker 2:  BR forties. I do not know what was in my builder's mind. Wow. When

999
01:03:34,405 --> 01:03:36,965
Speaker 2:  he did this. Wow. Be, I know

1000
01:03:37,655 --> 01:03:38,525
Speaker 10:  Those are massive.

1001
01:03:39,365 --> 01:03:43,205
Speaker 2:  I know they're huge. It's like a runway in my bedroom when the lights are

1002
01:03:43,245 --> 01:03:47,045
Speaker 2:  a full brightness is crazy. But I have

1003
01:03:47,045 --> 01:03:50,525
Speaker 2:  those connected right now to a gen one brilliant war switch,

1004
01:03:50,895 --> 01:03:54,725
Speaker 2:  which is a touchscreen wall switch. And that's where I also,

1005
01:03:54,885 --> 01:03:58,725
Speaker 2:  I do have a neutral wire in this room 'cause it's newer. So I use this

1006
01:03:59,065 --> 01:04:02,965
Speaker 2:  one to test different switches quite often. Motion detection is

1007
01:04:02,965 --> 01:04:06,445
Speaker 2:  quite useful for me in this one. I like to have the lights turn on as I walk

1008
01:04:06,445 --> 01:04:09,765
Speaker 2:  in as long as I can adjust the timing. 'cause there's nothing worse than

1009
01:04:09,765 --> 01:04:13,645
Speaker 2:  like a cat walking past at 2:00 AM and Yep. Turning your lights on.

1010
01:04:14,305 --> 01:04:18,125
Speaker 2:  So yes I do adjust when those can turn on. And, and then

1011
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:21,805
Speaker 2:  on my bedside table lamps I have, I'm testing two hue

1012
01:04:21,815 --> 01:04:25,485
Speaker 2:  lamps right now. They have the twilight and the table lamp and they are

1013
01:04:25,805 --> 01:04:29,605
Speaker 2:  actually awesome. The twilight especially for those kind of sleep

1014
01:04:29,605 --> 01:04:31,965
Speaker 2:  wake up routines we were talking about earlier. Yes. They kind of take it

1015
01:04:31,965 --> 01:04:35,765
Speaker 2:  to the next level right from the bulbs. So, and then in my

1016
01:04:36,685 --> 01:04:40,365
Speaker 2:  bathroom I have a very complicated setup. I have four

1017
01:04:40,545 --> 01:04:44,485
Speaker 2:  hue bulbs in my vanity, which you know, the vanity has like four

1018
01:04:44,485 --> 01:04:48,205
Speaker 2:  lights controlled by a tipi link. Tapo

1019
01:04:48,945 --> 01:04:52,725
Speaker 2:  matter on off switch because you cannot put LED

1020
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:56,685
Speaker 2:  bulbs SMART LED bulbs on a dimmer right. Switch because they'll go nuts.

1021
01:04:57,505 --> 01:05:01,445
Speaker 2:  So it's an on off switch. And then I also have the fan and the two regular

1022
01:05:01,455 --> 01:05:05,045
Speaker 2:  light fixtures in the room or controlled by Tapo. So I have four

1023
01:05:05,275 --> 01:05:09,205
Speaker 2:  Tapo smart switches in there and those all matter now. So again,

1024
01:05:09,285 --> 01:05:13,005
Speaker 2:  I can control all of that through Apple Home. And I also can

1025
01:05:13,475 --> 01:05:17,325
Speaker 2:  control the tone of the lights, which is very important when

1026
01:05:17,325 --> 01:05:20,845
Speaker 2:  you are using vanity lights because you want really bright light Yep. In

1027
01:05:20,845 --> 01:05:23,925
Speaker 2:  the mornings when you're doing makeup or getting ready. But when you walk

1028
01:05:23,925 --> 01:05:27,205
Speaker 2:  in to go to the loo at 2:00 AM you want it to be in really dim. So

1029
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:31,525
Speaker 2:  that unfortunately I really wanna get that set up with a motion sensor because

1030
01:05:31,525 --> 01:05:35,485
Speaker 2:  that's obviously a nice feature when you walk in the room at night. But I

1031
01:05:35,485 --> 01:05:38,365
Speaker 2:  have not managed to get it to work properly mainly because something keeps

1032
01:05:38,365 --> 01:05:42,165
Speaker 2:  going wrong and it will turn off and my husband said to me if if the

1033
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:44,845
Speaker 2:  the lights turn off in the bathroom on me one more time I'm gonna rip them

1034
01:05:44,845 --> 01:05:45,925
Speaker 2:  out the wall. So

1035
01:05:46,395 --> 01:05:47,885
Speaker 10:  Yeah, I get that every once in a while.

1036
01:05:47,895 --> 01:05:48,965
Speaker 2:  Gotta do some work there.

1037
01:05:51,025 --> 01:05:54,925
Speaker 2:  But yes, throughout the house I do have a few areas I

1038
01:05:54,925 --> 01:05:58,565
Speaker 2:  use motion sensors but as you mentioned those specific

1039
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:02,685
Speaker 2:  use cases is where I find it most helpful. So I also have a hue bulb and

1040
01:06:02,685 --> 01:06:06,285
Speaker 2:  a hue motion sensor in my laundry room. As you mentioned. That's something

1041
01:06:06,285 --> 01:06:09,765
Speaker 2:  that you do and that works really well 'cause you can use Hue adaptive

1042
01:06:10,205 --> 01:06:13,765
Speaker 2:  lighting feature where you just press a button

1043
01:06:14,145 --> 01:06:17,885
Speaker 2:  in the app and it will automatically schedule the light to turn on at different

1044
01:06:17,885 --> 01:06:21,045
Speaker 2:  temperature based on the time of day. So if I walk into the laundry room

1045
01:06:21,045 --> 01:06:25,005
Speaker 2:  at 2:00 AM not something I do regularly, it will come on at a dimmer

1046
01:06:25,005 --> 01:06:27,925
Speaker 2:  light. Right. Whereas when I walk in at 8:00 AM it comes on nice and bright

1047
01:06:27,925 --> 01:06:29,845
Speaker 2:  so I can see what I'm doing. Yep.

1048
01:06:30,075 --> 01:06:31,685
Speaker 10:  What are you doing for outside lighting?

1049
01:06:33,485 --> 01:06:37,465
Speaker 2:  Yes. So that is an area I've been testing a

1050
01:06:37,465 --> 01:06:41,385
Speaker 2:  lot of new stuff because you mentioned Hugh was the main player in

1051
01:06:41,385 --> 01:06:45,305
Speaker 2:  this space for a long time and they were kind of the only player. But recently

1052
01:06:46,105 --> 01:06:49,865
Speaker 2:  a lot of people have moved into this space. So I actually right now have

1053
01:06:49,925 --> 01:06:53,865
Speaker 2:  the nano leaf outdoor string lights around my patio and the life

1054
01:06:54,025 --> 01:06:57,665
Speaker 2:  X string lights around my porch. And they're

1055
01:06:57,795 --> 01:07:01,465
Speaker 2:  great. They're so fun. Again, during holidays you can change the colors

1056
01:07:02,165 --> 01:07:05,625
Speaker 2:  and then, but generally we just have them on the, you know, a nice sort of

1057
01:07:05,815 --> 01:07:09,185
Speaker 2:  warm tone. So it's lovely to sit out at night under them.

1058
01:07:09,765 --> 01:07:13,745
Speaker 2:  And then I have, I actually have some ring motion sensing

1059
01:07:13,775 --> 01:07:17,745
Speaker 2:  activated lights along the path, but

1060
01:07:17,815 --> 01:07:21,425
Speaker 2:  mine are battery powered. I bought, actually got them a long time ago. They

1061
01:07:21,585 --> 01:07:24,345
Speaker 2:  recently, I think they have solar powered ones now. Yep. The battery power

1062
01:07:24,395 --> 01:07:28,265
Speaker 2:  means that half the time they're dead And I haven't gotten around to

1063
01:07:28,265 --> 01:07:32,185
Speaker 2:  put the 1500 D batteries back into them. I need to get them

1064
01:07:32,185 --> 01:07:33,225
Speaker 2:  working again. Yep.

1065
01:07:33,505 --> 01:07:35,265
Speaker 10:  I remember those very well.

1066
01:07:35,335 --> 01:07:38,945
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that was their first ones that came out I think. And then I

1067
01:07:39,185 --> 01:07:43,065
Speaker 2:  recently added, and I've been testing the ai.ai.is

1068
01:07:43,065 --> 01:07:46,545
Speaker 2:  the name of the brand. And they have little solar

1069
01:07:46,615 --> 01:07:50,385
Speaker 2:  powered path lights and those are colorful as well. They're Bluetooth

1070
01:07:50,385 --> 01:07:53,905
Speaker 2:  though, which has been a bit of a pain. Mm. Because this is the issue, once

1071
01:07:53,905 --> 01:07:57,705
Speaker 2:  you put things in the garden, connectivity can become a problem.

1072
01:07:57,885 --> 01:08:01,745
Speaker 2:  Yep. And then I have floodlight cameras, so like a ring floodlight

1073
01:08:01,745 --> 01:08:05,545
Speaker 2:  cameras, I, I test a lot of different floodlight cameras so that that's the

1074
01:08:05,825 --> 01:08:09,305
Speaker 2:  security lighting. And then just a week or so ago I

1075
01:08:09,305 --> 01:08:12,665
Speaker 2:  installed a new device from Govi, which is

1076
01:08:13,015 --> 01:08:16,965
Speaker 2:  something I had never come across before. It's basically like a street lamp.

1077
01:08:18,555 --> 01:08:22,525
Speaker 2:  It's a smart street lamp that you can stick in your garden. It's huge.

1078
01:08:22,875 --> 01:08:26,445
Speaker 2:  It's like 10 foot tall and it has this awesome

1079
01:08:26,865 --> 01:08:30,765
Speaker 2:  big kind of canopy and you can have lights that go up, but you can also have

1080
01:08:30,765 --> 01:08:34,485
Speaker 2:  lights that go down and it's all color changing. When I turn it on at night,

1081
01:08:35,145 --> 01:08:37,845
Speaker 2:  my whole backyard is like lit up. Yeah. It's, it's,

1082
01:08:38,115 --> 01:08:40,165
Speaker 10:  It's a lot. Cool. It's a lumm if I remember correctly.

1083
01:08:40,165 --> 01:08:41,805
Speaker 2:  It's a lot, a lot of lumens. Yes.

1084
01:08:43,825 --> 01:08:47,445
Speaker 2:  But I have definitely restrained from the permanent outdoor lighting

1085
01:08:47,535 --> 01:08:51,325
Speaker 2:  thing that everyone's doing on the houses. Yeah, me too. I think

1086
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:55,765
Speaker 2:  Govi and Nano Leaf all have those. GE sink I think also has a,

1087
01:08:56,305 --> 01:09:00,125
Speaker 2:  an option there And I just can't get into

1088
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:02,525
Speaker 2:  that. It just seems like a bit too much for me.

1089
01:09:04,065 --> 01:09:04,285
Speaker 2:  So.

1090
01:09:04,595 --> 01:09:08,205
Speaker 10:  Yeah, well I, I look at that as like I look at smart fridges, right?

1091
01:09:08,385 --> 01:09:11,965
Speaker 10:  It it, my house is gonna be there forever. Forever. This technology

1092
01:09:12,305 --> 01:09:16,165
Speaker 10:  is gonna be outdated in five or six years probably. So

1093
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:20,205
Speaker 10:  yeah, do I really want to invest the time to install something quote

1094
01:09:20,205 --> 01:09:23,085
Speaker 10:  permanently? I don't know how I feel about that.

1095
01:09:23,755 --> 01:09:27,245
Speaker 2:  Okay. So thanks for the rundown. Hopefully some of that

1096
01:09:27,555 --> 01:09:31,405
Speaker 2:  will give you some inspiration call from your

1097
01:09:31,685 --> 01:09:35,325
Speaker 2:  question of how others automate their lights. But we're gonna move on to

1098
01:09:35,325 --> 01:09:38,925
Speaker 2:  another question about smart lighting. And this is from Ty

1099
01:09:39,115 --> 01:09:42,725
Speaker 2:  from Oregon and he's actually called in and left us a voicemail. So we're

1100
01:09:42,725 --> 01:09:43,365
Speaker 2:  gonna listen to that now

1101
01:09:44,715 --> 01:09:48,365
Speaker 11:  I've urge team, I've been doing the smart home thing for a while now

1102
01:09:48,705 --> 01:09:52,525
Speaker 11:  and Home Assistant is my hub for all the stuff. It makes

1103
01:09:52,525 --> 01:09:56,085
Speaker 11:  life so much easier. I have the house where I want it, but

1104
01:09:56,605 --> 01:10:00,085
Speaker 11:  realized that I might be setting myself up for some future headaches if

1105
01:10:00,085 --> 01:10:04,045
Speaker 11:  I ever wanna sell. I have a whole bunch of different system thread

1106
01:10:04,045 --> 01:10:07,805
Speaker 11:  where I can get it wifi where I can't. And I'm

1107
01:10:07,805 --> 01:10:10,525
Speaker 11:  currently running gov recessed LED lights,

1108
01:10:11,685 --> 01:10:15,645
Speaker 11:  LIFX overheads Modern Forms fans with light

1109
01:10:15,645 --> 01:10:19,525
Speaker 11:  attachments, Shelly Relay switches, as well as a

1110
01:10:19,525 --> 01:10:22,605
Speaker 11:  bunch of casa switches that I've turned into Smart scene controllers

1111
01:10:23,865 --> 01:10:27,245
Speaker 11:  if I ever wanna leave this place. Am I just

1112
01:10:27,685 --> 01:10:30,405
Speaker 11:  absolutely hosed. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.

1113
01:10:31,835 --> 01:10:32,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

1114
01:10:34,595 --> 01:10:38,485
Speaker 2:  this is a very common issue when it comes to the smart home and it's becoming

1115
01:10:38,685 --> 01:10:41,885
Speaker 2:  a bigger and bigger issue as the smart home matures and more and more people

1116
01:10:41,885 --> 01:10:45,525
Speaker 2:  have smart homes and more and more people are moving from smart homes.

1117
01:10:46,345 --> 01:10:49,605
Speaker 2:  And this is actually something that I've written about in the past so that

1118
01:10:49,605 --> 01:10:52,925
Speaker 2:  we have a whole article on The Verge about how to move your smart home. And

1119
01:10:52,925 --> 01:10:56,085
Speaker 2:  I know Richard, you did a couple episodes of your Smart Home Show podcast

1120
01:10:56,675 --> 01:11:00,405
Speaker 2:  dedicated to this exact question. Correct. So go listen to those

1121
01:11:00,625 --> 01:11:04,565
Speaker 2:  for more details. We'll we'll include some links, but for

1122
01:11:04,565 --> 01:11:08,325
Speaker 2:  now, what, what would your sort of first response to this

1123
01:11:08,565 --> 01:11:12,285
Speaker 2:  question be other than what a cool lighting setup you have? Ty, I'm

1124
01:11:12,285 --> 01:11:14,565
Speaker 2:  impressed. I impressive. Very impressed.

1125
01:11:15,205 --> 01:11:18,765
Speaker 10:  I I, I, you know the, the how hosted are you thing? I think it really

1126
01:11:18,765 --> 01:11:22,525
Speaker 10:  depends on like what you want to have happen to all of that

1127
01:11:22,525 --> 01:11:26,445
Speaker 10:  stuff. When you move, I'm assuming you'll want to take some of it with

1128
01:11:26,445 --> 01:11:29,685
Speaker 10:  you. Other stuff that's built in like

1129
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:34,005
Speaker 10:  thermostats and doorbells and things like that you probably don't want to

1130
01:11:34,005 --> 01:11:37,885
Speaker 10:  take with you. You'll probably leave those behind. So the biggest

1131
01:11:37,895 --> 01:11:41,845
Speaker 10:  thing that I learned the last time

1132
01:11:42,075 --> 01:11:46,045
Speaker 10:  that I did this And I ended up transferring a bunch of accounts

1133
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:50,205
Speaker 10:  over to make this easier and now I do this this way

1134
01:11:50,545 --> 01:11:54,205
Speaker 10:  in my new home is I created a house

1135
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:55,845
Speaker 10:  email address.

1136
01:11:56,985 --> 01:12:00,525
Speaker 2:  That's exactly what I say to do in my article. Yeah, I think Stacey

1137
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:02,845
Speaker 2:  Higginbotham was the one who came up with this idea. I

1138
01:12:02,845 --> 01:12:03,125
Speaker 10:  Think it was

1139
01:12:03,125 --> 01:12:06,645
Speaker 2:  Stacy. It was Stacy. So props to Stacey, it's such a good idea. Yep. Sorry

1140
01:12:06,745 --> 01:12:08,445
Speaker 2:  you, you keep explaining. Well and

1141
01:12:08,785 --> 01:12:12,485
Speaker 10:  So I, for my ring account and for my

1142
01:12:13,595 --> 01:12:17,205
Speaker 10:  Chamberlain account for the garage door and for my Nest

1143
01:12:17,205 --> 01:12:21,165
Speaker 10:  account actually Nest account, yes. But now

1144
01:12:21,165 --> 01:12:24,525
Speaker 10:  with Google you can't really do that anymore. But for things that are more

1145
01:12:24,525 --> 01:12:28,205
Speaker 10:  or less permanent, I, for all of those, I created the accounts using the

1146
01:12:28,205 --> 01:12:31,645
Speaker 10:  house email address. And the reason for that was that when I moved from

1147
01:12:31,645 --> 01:12:35,085
Speaker 10:  my last house, I just wanted to sign that stuff over to the next owner.

1148
01:12:35,515 --> 01:12:39,085
Speaker 10:  Yeah. And I didn't want to have to worry about how do we transfer these

1149
01:12:39,085 --> 01:12:41,965
Speaker 10:  outta my account and then they have to figure it all out to set it all up

1150
01:12:41,965 --> 01:12:45,925
Speaker 10:  again. What a hassle would that be? So it, it was

1151
01:12:46,045 --> 01:12:50,005
Speaker 10:  a lot easier if it was just on a house account. And then there is the

1152
01:12:50,515 --> 01:12:54,485
Speaker 10:  undoing of things that you want to take with you. And that in

1153
01:12:54,485 --> 01:12:58,365
Speaker 10:  itself can take a lot of time. Don't underestimate what

1154
01:12:58,365 --> 01:13:02,285
Speaker 10:  effort that can be because you may have routines and and

1155
01:13:02,985 --> 01:13:06,845
Speaker 10:  scenes and stuff like that that you'll wanna probably capture.

1156
01:13:07,605 --> 01:13:11,405
Speaker 10:  'cause if they're useful to you, they might be useful to you in a new

1157
01:13:11,405 --> 01:13:15,045
Speaker 10:  home and a new setup. Mm. So that

1158
01:13:15,245 --> 01:13:19,085
Speaker 10:  requires a fair amount of planning. But seriously, if

1159
01:13:19,085 --> 01:13:22,765
Speaker 10:  you've invested in Life Ex and Govi

1160
01:13:23,145 --> 01:13:26,725
Speaker 10:  and other bulbs that are a lot more expensive than just your average LED

1161
01:13:26,725 --> 01:13:30,125
Speaker 10:  bulb, take 'em with you. You don't, you don't wanna be leaving that kind

1162
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:30,765
Speaker 10:  of stuff behind.

1163
01:13:31,475 --> 01:13:35,245
Speaker 2:  Just go to a Home Depot and buy a few, you know, inexpensive, decent

1164
01:13:35,675 --> 01:13:38,885
Speaker 2:  LEDs and swap 'em back in and take those with you. I, I agree.

1165
01:13:39,395 --> 01:13:43,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. But you know, there are some

1166
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:47,085
Speaker 2:  studies that say, you know, the smarts features in homes can

1167
01:13:47,085 --> 01:13:50,845
Speaker 2:  help sell it. So if you are kind of setting the home up, showing

1168
01:13:50,905 --> 01:13:54,605
Speaker 2:  it off with the smart features in, then obviously those are likely

1169
01:13:54,635 --> 01:13:58,485
Speaker 2:  need to convey or be part of your sales process.

1170
01:13:59,025 --> 01:14:02,565
Speaker 2:  So I did check in, so you mentioned Ty, that you use Home

1171
01:14:02,565 --> 01:14:06,445
Speaker 2:  assistant And I did check in with PA who is the founder of

1172
01:14:06,445 --> 01:14:10,005
Speaker 2:  Oh great. And CEO of home assistant about what he would

1173
01:14:10,245 --> 01:14:14,125
Speaker 2:  recommend in terms terms of moving your system to someone

1174
01:14:14,125 --> 01:14:17,845
Speaker 2:  else because as he points out, home assistant is

1175
01:14:17,905 --> 01:14:21,845
Speaker 2:  all local. So In theory and his answer is you

1176
01:14:21,845 --> 01:14:25,045
Speaker 2:  can just hand over the password and username

1177
01:14:25,745 --> 01:14:29,525
Speaker 2:  to the new owner and they can just change it

1178
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:33,565
Speaker 2:  to their own and everything should just work, it should just

1179
01:14:33,625 --> 01:14:37,485
Speaker 2:  switch over. However, should, there's definitely

1180
01:14:37,565 --> 01:14:41,445
Speaker 2:  a should in there. There isn't like an official transfer method he said,

1181
01:14:41,985 --> 01:14:45,605
Speaker 2:  but the should is if any of the products that you're using with home

1182
01:14:45,605 --> 01:14:49,485
Speaker 2:  assistant are cloud dependent, which they could be like the

1183
01:14:49,635 --> 01:14:53,125
Speaker 2:  Govi and the Life X could, you could be using with wifi

1184
01:14:53,465 --> 01:14:57,285
Speaker 2:  or in the cloud. Although both of them now have matter support.

1185
01:14:57,505 --> 01:15:01,445
Speaker 2:  But if they are cloud dependent then you're gonna have to transfer somehow

1186
01:15:01,595 --> 01:15:05,565
Speaker 2:  that account. And that's where things get a little tricky. And he said, you

1187
01:15:05,565 --> 01:15:09,485
Speaker 2:  know, that would mean that, you know, some sort of authentication is gonna

1188
01:15:09,485 --> 01:15:12,845
Speaker 2:  be required that you'd need to share. And this is where having set them up

1189
01:15:12,845 --> 01:15:16,725
Speaker 2:  originally on a house email account would make life a lot easier

1190
01:15:16,785 --> 01:15:20,765
Speaker 2:  for you. But Paolos did say to us about this question

1191
01:15:20,765 --> 01:15:24,645
Speaker 2:  that he said, this is something that opens standards will solve

1192
01:15:24,765 --> 01:15:28,685
Speaker 2:  because they're all local. And just to clarify that, that means

1193
01:15:28,685 --> 01:15:32,645
Speaker 2:  that your devices are working locally in your home and not dependent

1194
01:15:32,645 --> 01:15:36,365
Speaker 2:  on the internet. So they work just like your standard door lock would like,

1195
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:40,285
Speaker 2:  you wouldn't have to worry about transferring ownership of your door lock

1196
01:15:40,665 --> 01:15:44,485
Speaker 2:  or any other, most of the other things that you would leave in your house

1197
01:15:44,635 --> 01:15:48,285
Speaker 2:  when you sell it to someone. And this is something that things like

1198
01:15:48,345 --> 01:15:52,325
Speaker 2:  matter and home assistant brands and systems that are

1199
01:15:52,325 --> 01:15:56,125
Speaker 2:  working locally without cloud dependencies should make easier

1200
01:15:56,395 --> 01:15:59,045
Speaker 2:  because they're just gonna become part of the infrastructure of our home.

1201
01:15:59,185 --> 01:16:02,565
Speaker 2:  It doesn't mean you won't have an internet connection because there are benefits

1202
01:16:02,565 --> 01:16:05,925
Speaker 2:  to that, but you don't have to have the internet connection. Right,

1203
01:16:06,565 --> 01:16:10,245
Speaker 10:  Right. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. I think that's a,

1204
01:16:10,445 --> 01:16:14,125
Speaker 10:  a really optimistic solution. I think the,

1205
01:16:14,505 --> 01:16:18,485
Speaker 10:  the biggest thing that concerns me about that is that I'm assuming if you've

1206
01:16:18,485 --> 01:16:21,965
Speaker 10:  put this much time into your home assistant environment, you've probably

1207
01:16:21,965 --> 01:16:25,765
Speaker 10:  created some automations that are specific to

1208
01:16:26,035 --> 01:16:29,645
Speaker 10:  your household's use of the space. Yeah. So

1209
01:16:30,255 --> 01:16:34,205
Speaker 10:  those may be jarring or undesired by a

1210
01:16:34,205 --> 01:16:37,845
Speaker 10:  new homeowner. So the, one of the other things that you should make sure

1211
01:16:37,845 --> 01:16:41,805
Speaker 10:  you do is talk with the buyer during the

1212
01:16:41,805 --> 01:16:45,285
Speaker 10:  purchasing process. Once you have that contract signed, find out

1213
01:16:45,785 --> 01:16:49,485
Speaker 10:  do they want you to keep this stuff there? Do they want to,

1214
01:16:49,745 --> 01:16:53,405
Speaker 10:  you know, remove some of it. If they're ultimately gonna remove it anyway,

1215
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:57,485
Speaker 10:  then why not keep the assets? And

1216
01:16:58,565 --> 01:17:02,125
Speaker 10:  I would suggest turning off most of your

1217
01:17:02,595 --> 01:17:05,685
Speaker 10:  automated stuff for them to then determine

1218
01:17:06,375 --> 01:17:09,885
Speaker 10:  which of those routines make sense for their lifestyle.

1219
01:17:10,825 --> 01:17:14,685
Speaker 2:  Yes. So, I dunno if you remember Richard a while back, I contacted you because

1220
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:18,725
Speaker 2:  a, a colleague at The Verge brother had just moved into a new house that

1221
01:17:18,745 --> 01:17:22,685
Speaker 2:  had all inste on, but they had no idea of

1222
01:17:22,685 --> 01:17:25,565
Speaker 2:  what was happening or how to use it. And like the lights would just turn

1223
01:17:25,565 --> 01:17:29,245
Speaker 2:  on at random times in the day and the shades would raise and, and they didn't

1224
01:17:29,245 --> 01:17:32,085
Speaker 2:  know what to do. They had no idea. Right. And at this point that company

1225
01:17:32,145 --> 01:17:36,005
Speaker 2:  was no longer really in business. So they're, they're back as as we've recently

1226
01:17:36,005 --> 01:17:39,765
Speaker 2:  discussed. Yep. But yes, they were, this is, if you're gonna leave stuff,

1227
01:17:39,865 --> 01:17:43,645
Speaker 2:  please tell the person that you're selling the house to how to use it

1228
01:17:44,125 --> 01:17:47,645
Speaker 2:  because you're just setting them up for a really bad experience. Yeah.

1229
01:17:47,645 --> 01:17:51,405
Speaker 2:  Otherwise, yeah. Excellent. Okay, wonderful.

1230
01:17:51,435 --> 01:17:55,005
Speaker 2:  Well thank you. That was, appreciate that. Call Ty.

1231
01:17:55,275 --> 01:17:59,205
Speaker 2:  Hopefully we helped a little bit there, but right now we have

1232
01:17:59,205 --> 01:18:03,085
Speaker 2:  to go to a break and we are gonna have more of your questions when we come

1233
01:18:03,085 --> 01:18:03,285
Speaker 2:  back.

1234
01:20:33,535 --> 01:20:37,115
Speaker 2:  We are back with Richard Gunther. Thank you Richard for joining us. I have

1235
01:20:37,155 --> 01:20:40,155
Speaker 2:  a few more questions for you. Alright, so let's dive right in.

1236
01:20:41,025 --> 01:20:44,955
Speaker 2:  Okay, the first one, another, this is the reverse of the

1237
01:20:44,955 --> 01:20:48,195
Speaker 2:  story that we just answered, which is, this is from

1238
01:20:48,435 --> 01:20:52,195
Speaker 2:  Nicholas Martin. This is another email he sent and I'm gonna run through

1239
01:20:52,195 --> 01:20:55,595
Speaker 2:  what he said. So I'm planning to buy a house in the coming months and I've

1240
01:20:55,595 --> 01:20:59,355
Speaker 2:  started thinking seriously about the smart devices I'd like to install. Right

1241
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:03,035
Speaker 2:  now I live in a rented apartment so I've kept things fairly simple when it

1242
01:21:03,035 --> 01:21:06,475
Speaker 2:  comes to lighting. I use Philip Hugh Bobs in the main rooms, hue switches

1243
01:21:06,475 --> 01:21:10,315
Speaker 2:  and sensors and I've installed hue switches on top of

1244
01:21:10,315 --> 01:21:14,275
Speaker 2:  the existing ones, which is far from ideal, especially for guests.

1245
01:21:14,935 --> 01:21:18,555
Speaker 2:  And I'd also really like to make sure that if my network hue bridge

1246
01:21:18,775 --> 01:21:22,715
Speaker 2:  or border router, so that would be the thread, border router goes down,

1247
01:21:23,135 --> 01:21:26,915
Speaker 2:  my lights still work like normal. And that's where things start

1248
01:21:26,915 --> 01:21:30,795
Speaker 2:  getting tricky. It feels like the issue of how smart home

1249
01:21:30,795 --> 01:21:34,515
Speaker 2:  devices behave during technical failures doesn't get much coverage.

1250
01:21:35,095 --> 01:21:38,155
Speaker 2:  And then from what I've seen on Reddit and increasing number of people are

1251
01:21:38,155 --> 01:21:41,875
Speaker 2:  opting for smart switches over smart bulbs, this seems like a

1252
01:21:41,875 --> 01:21:45,555
Speaker 2:  promising approach but I'm worried it might mean losing the flexibility of

1253
01:21:45,755 --> 01:21:49,355
Speaker 2:  RGB lighting unless I use a decoupled smart switch that

1254
01:21:49,355 --> 01:21:53,155
Speaker 2:  always stays on. But if I go that route, wouldn't the switch

1255
01:21:53,155 --> 01:21:56,755
Speaker 2:  stop working properly in case of a smart home failure? I've read about

1256
01:21:56,975 --> 01:22:00,915
Speaker 2:  ZigBee and Matter binding as possible solutions, but this all feels

1257
01:22:01,095 --> 01:22:04,875
Speaker 2:  way more complicated than it should be for something as basic as turning

1258
01:22:04,935 --> 01:22:08,915
Speaker 2:  the lights on and off. And that's why I'd love to hear your take. Do

1259
01:22:08,915 --> 01:22:12,595
Speaker 2:  you think the better approach is Smart switches or smart bulbs or maybe

1260
01:22:12,625 --> 01:22:16,115
Speaker 2:  some kind of hybrid setup? And if so, how would

1261
01:22:16,475 --> 01:22:20,275
Speaker 2:  this work? The eternal question bulbs or

1262
01:22:20,595 --> 01:22:24,235
Speaker 2:  switches? Yeah. Richard, if you were starting from

1263
01:22:24,235 --> 01:22:27,155
Speaker 2:  scratch, which would you go for and why?

1264
01:22:27,695 --> 01:22:31,315
Speaker 10:  You And I have both written about this in the past and I'm, I'm

1265
01:22:31,535 --> 01:22:34,955
Speaker 10:  on team switch and that's

1266
01:22:35,265 --> 01:22:39,035
Speaker 10:  primarily because most of my lighting is dimmable

1267
01:22:39,735 --> 01:22:43,355
Speaker 10:  but not color changing. Yeah. It gets more complicated

1268
01:22:43,545 --> 01:22:46,795
Speaker 10:  when you want color changing as you indicated with your question

1269
01:22:47,105 --> 01:22:50,875
Speaker 10:  regarding RGP lighting. And that's a problem that

1270
01:22:50,875 --> 01:22:54,555
Speaker 10:  frankly even in high, high-end custom

1271
01:22:54,745 --> 01:22:57,515
Speaker 10:  installations has not been

1272
01:22:58,535 --> 01:23:02,195
Speaker 10:  solved in a way that I think is user-friendly.

1273
01:23:02,505 --> 01:23:06,415
Speaker 10:  Yeah. We still have this problem where there's on off and

1274
01:23:06,415 --> 01:23:10,335
Speaker 10:  then there's switching between different color modes and how do

1275
01:23:10,335 --> 01:23:13,975
Speaker 10:  you handle that in the space of one switch And

1276
01:23:14,045 --> 01:23:17,855
Speaker 10:  lots of companies are trying it. I don't think anyone's really nailed it.

1277
01:23:17,855 --> 01:23:21,695
Speaker 10:  Well now if you have smart bulbs and the

1278
01:23:21,695 --> 01:23:25,535
Speaker 10:  primary thing that you want do with a switch is just

1279
01:23:25,675 --> 01:23:29,535
Speaker 10:  be able to control it and dim it, then yes, the switches that have a

1280
01:23:29,585 --> 01:23:33,335
Speaker 10:  smart bulb mode, there are a couple vendors putting those

1281
01:23:33,435 --> 01:23:37,335
Speaker 10:  out. I know zoos has them in a valley has them, those

1282
01:23:37,335 --> 01:23:40,775
Speaker 10:  are both for Z-Wave. GE

1283
01:23:41,085 --> 01:23:44,655
Speaker 10:  Sync has this capability, the Lutron Aurora

1284
01:23:44,875 --> 01:23:47,855
Speaker 10:  is an example of that. That may be one of the things that you're using when

1285
01:23:47,855 --> 01:23:51,775
Speaker 10:  you talk about having a controller over your existing switch.

1286
01:23:52,765 --> 01:23:56,335
Speaker 10:  It's a clever device but you're right, you're

1287
01:23:56,495 --> 01:23:59,415
Speaker 10:  dependent on your smart home system

1288
01:24:00,325 --> 01:24:04,295
Speaker 10:  working to make that all work properly. That's a

1289
01:24:04,295 --> 01:24:07,975
Speaker 10:  different question. Let's get to that in a second. But I'm curious where

1290
01:24:07,995 --> 01:24:10,295
Speaker 10:  you are on team switch versus bulb.

1291
01:24:11,565 --> 01:24:15,295
Speaker 2:  Yeah, so it's, it's been an internal problem in my home for sure. And as

1292
01:24:15,295 --> 01:24:19,255
Speaker 2:  I mentioned, I actually have some smart bulbs connected to a switch so

1293
01:24:19,315 --> 01:24:23,135
Speaker 2:  you can connect hue and color changing smart,

1294
01:24:23,235 --> 01:24:27,095
Speaker 2:  any smart light bulb to a switch that is smart as

1295
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:30,935
Speaker 2:  long as the switch that is smart is just on and off, it's when you want to

1296
01:24:30,995 --> 01:24:34,655
Speaker 2:  dim that you get into issues. Mainly there's a

1297
01:24:34,935 --> 01:24:38,215
Speaker 2:  a whole electrical reason but it, the way a dimming

1298
01:24:38,795 --> 01:24:42,255
Speaker 2:  system works is changing the level of power to the light

1299
01:24:42,595 --> 01:24:46,535
Speaker 2:  and when you do that you mess with the power and and you get flashing.

1300
01:24:46,565 --> 01:24:50,455
Speaker 2:  I've had a light switch, a smart light switch from Caer Fry. Yep.

1301
01:24:50,455 --> 01:24:54,175
Speaker 2:  Because I had a, it connected to an A Hue LED bulb

1302
01:24:54,675 --> 01:24:58,135
Speaker 2:  and then you have the horrible flickering when you're trying to control them.

1303
01:24:58,155 --> 01:25:01,575
Speaker 2:  So it's just never a good solution that way. It's okay if you're just using

1304
01:25:01,775 --> 01:25:05,615
Speaker 2:  a smart switch in most cases. That's the situation I have in my

1305
01:25:05,895 --> 01:25:09,215
Speaker 2:  bathroom. But the problem there is I have to control 'em two different ways.

1306
01:25:09,355 --> 01:25:13,175
Speaker 2:  So I have the, you know, turn on bathroom switch and then I

1307
01:25:13,175 --> 01:25:16,815
Speaker 2:  have a just vanity lights as

1308
01:25:16,815 --> 01:25:20,535
Speaker 2:  different phrases that I can use to talk to my smart assistant to get what

1309
01:25:20,535 --> 01:25:24,495
Speaker 2:  I want, which is not ideal. So I'm really interested in

1310
01:25:24,495 --> 01:25:28,415
Speaker 2:  these switches that have smart bulb modes. I haven't been able to

1311
01:25:28,415 --> 01:25:31,375
Speaker 2:  try any and that's why I got quite excited. When you mentioned you have elli

1312
01:25:31,695 --> 01:25:35,335
Speaker 2:  switches because I understand that they're one brand that does this. Yep.

1313
01:25:35,755 --> 01:25:39,535
Speaker 2:  But it sounds like you haven't set those up with color changing bulbs yet.

1314
01:25:40,015 --> 01:25:43,455
Speaker 10:  I have not tried that yet. That's something that I still want to do, but

1315
01:25:43,595 --> 01:25:45,095
Speaker 10:  yes, that is possible. Yeah.

1316
01:25:45,435 --> 01:25:48,175
Speaker 2:  And then a carrot is another brand I mentioned when I was talking about the

1317
01:25:48,175 --> 01:25:51,935
Speaker 2:  ceiling light. So after I reviewed the ceiling light, they have come out

1318
01:25:51,965 --> 01:25:55,495
Speaker 2:  with a smart switch that can control their

1319
01:25:55,625 --> 01:25:59,415
Speaker 2:  bulbs specifically. And this is again where you get into the

1320
01:25:59,465 --> 01:26:03,365
Speaker 2:  smart lighting cabal where even really if you

1321
01:26:03,365 --> 01:26:06,485
Speaker 2:  stick with one brand, generally you might, you will get solutions like this.

1322
01:26:06,505 --> 01:26:10,125
Speaker 2:  So a carer does have switches that have smart bulb mode

1323
01:26:10,745 --> 01:26:14,165
Speaker 2:  for their bulbs and their light fixtures. Unfortunately my smart ceiling

1324
01:26:14,175 --> 01:26:18,165
Speaker 2:  light is in a room that does not have neutral wires so I cannot use

1325
01:26:18,335 --> 01:26:21,765
Speaker 2:  their smart light bulb switch. So

1326
01:26:22,265 --> 01:26:25,565
Speaker 2:  it feels like this is a problem that still hasn't been solved, especially

1327
01:26:25,565 --> 01:26:29,045
Speaker 2:  because you don't want necessarily to always use one brand.

1328
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:34,125
Speaker 2:  One of the great scenarios for Nicholas here is that

1329
01:26:34,185 --> 01:26:37,725
Speaker 2:  he is moving into a new home and that starting from scratch,

1330
01:26:38,025 --> 01:26:41,485
Speaker 2:  I'm so jealous. I would love to start from scratch,

1331
01:26:41,995 --> 01:26:45,565
Speaker 2:  just do it all over. 'cause I think today there are better

1332
01:26:45,565 --> 01:26:49,045
Speaker 2:  solutions. I think one of them in this scenario

1333
01:26:49,335 --> 01:26:53,325
Speaker 2:  would be choosing a brand like in AVE or a carer that

1334
01:26:53,425 --> 01:26:57,125
Speaker 2:  has smart bulb mode and doing both. Because if you want a color changing

1335
01:26:57,125 --> 01:27:00,925
Speaker 2:  lights, you want to keep using your HU bulbs but you don't want to keep

1336
01:27:00,925 --> 01:27:04,885
Speaker 2:  using their remotes which work fine. And that's what I have in my kids'

1337
01:27:04,885 --> 01:27:08,405
Speaker 2:  rooms are the remotes, that's how they control their lights. But it's not

1338
01:27:08,465 --> 01:27:12,445
Speaker 2:  as he mentions, not great for guests. And it is, it's just not

1339
01:27:12,665 --> 01:27:16,565
Speaker 2:  an ideal solution. I wish Hue would partner with someone maybe to

1340
01:27:16,565 --> 01:27:20,485
Speaker 2:  come, I mean they do have the run less wire switches, but those don't,

1341
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:24,085
Speaker 2:  they also don't help with the color changing. You want to be able to

1342
01:27:24,275 --> 01:27:27,965
Speaker 2:  control the light changing as well, the color changing. And so then they

1343
01:27:27,965 --> 01:27:30,965
Speaker 2:  have, you know, buttons. This is another area that buttons are good. But

1344
01:27:31,235 --> 01:27:35,005
Speaker 2:  yeah, I think what I'm hoping we're gonna see, and he mentions

1345
01:27:35,005 --> 01:27:37,645
Speaker 2:  here matter binding And I, this is

1346
01:27:38,335 --> 01:27:42,245
Speaker 2:  definitely future casting. This is not something that's really ready yet.

1347
01:27:42,745 --> 01:27:45,885
Speaker 2:  And I know Richard, that you're gonna have some thoughts on matter binding.

1348
01:27:46,705 --> 01:27:50,285
Speaker 2:  But what this is gonna do essentially is

1349
01:27:51,295 --> 01:27:54,725
Speaker 2:  allow you to bind a switch to a light

1350
01:27:55,505 --> 01:27:58,995
Speaker 2:  locally. And this addresses your other question about

1351
01:27:59,105 --> 01:28:03,035
Speaker 2:  reliability. So what will happen is that the light switch

1352
01:28:03,135 --> 01:28:06,395
Speaker 2:  and the light bulb, and this could be multiple light switches and multiple

1353
01:28:06,395 --> 01:28:10,275
Speaker 2:  light bulbs will have like a local almost wire,

1354
01:28:10,875 --> 01:28:14,715
Speaker 2:  invisible wire connected to each other. And that will be

1355
01:28:14,715 --> 01:28:18,435
Speaker 2:  sort of permanently ingrained in their memory. And even if your hub goes

1356
01:28:18,435 --> 01:28:22,115
Speaker 2:  down, your internet goes down, anything goes down other than the power,

1357
01:28:22,905 --> 01:28:26,555
Speaker 2:  they will still be able to control each other. So the you flip the switch,

1358
01:28:26,575 --> 01:28:30,435
Speaker 2:  the light will turn on. And this is something that's part of matter. It's

1359
01:28:30,435 --> 01:28:33,995
Speaker 2:  also something that is part of the ZigBee standard. And I actually checked

1360
01:28:33,995 --> 01:28:37,875
Speaker 2:  in with the CSA, which runs matter about this. And the Chris Lare,

1361
01:28:38,055 --> 01:28:41,995
Speaker 2:  the CTO said, you know, the major value here of binding these

1362
01:28:41,995 --> 01:28:45,755
Speaker 2:  devices together is that is speed and reliability. Yep. So the

1363
01:28:45,755 --> 01:28:49,515
Speaker 2:  switch talks directly to the light, it's instantaneous versus

1364
01:28:49,695 --> 01:28:53,595
Speaker 2:  say like a button, which would then have to talk to a hub and then maybe

1365
01:28:53,595 --> 01:28:57,275
Speaker 2:  check rules on the cloud and then reply and tell the hub

1366
01:28:57,535 --> 01:29:01,445
Speaker 2:  to contact the light. Yep. So all of this could take, you know, less than

1367
01:29:01,485 --> 01:29:05,205
Speaker 2:  a few seconds or under a second, but still not as fast as flipping a light

1368
01:29:05,205 --> 01:29:08,005
Speaker 2:  switch, which is what we need. Right. So

1369
01:29:08,925 --> 01:29:12,895
Speaker 2:  it's an exciting thing. It's not something that we've seen any brands

1370
01:29:13,025 --> 01:29:17,015
Speaker 2:  adopt yet a Kara has said that they're looking into it, but it's

1371
01:29:17,015 --> 01:29:20,735
Speaker 2:  gonna be a while I think until I, if this is even gonna be a

1372
01:29:20,975 --> 01:29:24,615
Speaker 2:  solution. But what what is great about it is if it works in matter,

1373
01:29:25,075 --> 01:29:28,335
Speaker 2:  you wouldn't need to use the same brands. So In theory,

1374
01:29:28,955 --> 01:29:32,735
Speaker 2:  if your Phillips Hue bulbs worked with Matter binding and

1375
01:29:32,735 --> 01:29:35,775
Speaker 2:  you're a Kara Smart Switch worked with Matter binding, you could bind them

1376
01:29:35,975 --> 01:29:39,575
Speaker 2:  together and that feels like a future. I'm excited for

1377
01:29:39,605 --> 01:29:42,055
Speaker 2:  Richard. Throw cold water over me. No,

1378
01:29:42,215 --> 01:29:46,095
Speaker 10:  I, I agree. I agree. I, I just think we're okay. I think

1379
01:29:46,095 --> 01:29:48,895
Speaker 10:  we're a far way out for that. I mean we, we do have this

1380
01:29:50,125 --> 01:29:54,055
Speaker 10:  same sort of thing, insig B and frankly it's

1381
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:57,575
Speaker 10:  not dissimilar from how Insteon products work with each other. They

1382
01:29:58,335 --> 01:30:02,135
Speaker 10:  directly communicate with each other without the need for that hub to trigger

1383
01:30:02,205 --> 01:30:06,015
Speaker 10:  each other. So it is promising it could solve

1384
01:30:06,295 --> 01:30:09,975
Speaker 10:  a lot of these problems. You mentioned Aqara in your hybrid

1385
01:30:10,575 --> 01:30:14,455
Speaker 10:  situation I think, yeah, the best product that Aqara offers

1386
01:30:14,995 --> 01:30:18,815
Speaker 10:  now to help with this problem is their

1387
01:30:18,965 --> 01:30:22,535
Speaker 10:  four button scene controller. So they have a

1388
01:30:23,105 --> 01:30:26,855
Speaker 10:  scene controller that has a switch in it that allows one of the

1389
01:30:26,855 --> 01:30:30,775
Speaker 10:  buttons to be a switch and control the actual load. So turning it

1390
01:30:30,795 --> 01:30:34,255
Speaker 10:  on or off and then the other three buttons

1391
01:30:34,915 --> 01:30:38,575
Speaker 10:  can be set to trigger any matter scene. So

1392
01:30:39,205 --> 01:30:42,935
Speaker 10:  that could be different styles of using the light, different

1393
01:30:42,935 --> 01:30:46,855
Speaker 10:  colors or different moods that you want to set so that you

1394
01:30:46,855 --> 01:30:50,415
Speaker 10:  have one to turn it on and then the others could

1395
01:30:51,335 --> 01:30:55,255
Speaker 10:  trigger those scenes. You could even have those scenes potentially

1396
01:30:55,525 --> 01:30:59,255
Speaker 10:  also turn the light on if you didn't wanna have to manually turn it on first.

1397
01:30:59,435 --> 01:31:03,175
Speaker 10:  So there's some options for you we're just not

1398
01:31:03,745 --> 01:31:06,575
Speaker 10:  fully there yet. No,

1399
01:31:06,995 --> 01:31:10,895
Speaker 2:  No. So in the interim, Nicholas, I I mean you keep

1400
01:31:10,935 --> 01:31:14,895
Speaker 2:  your HU bulbs, bring 'em along, they work with Matter and

1401
01:31:15,595 --> 01:31:19,295
Speaker 2:  yes switches right now I think it sounds like maybe

1402
01:31:19,395 --> 01:31:23,295
Speaker 2:  the Aqara switches with the scenes could be a good way of controlling some

1403
01:31:23,295 --> 01:31:27,135
Speaker 2:  of the devices or in AVE switches with their smart

1404
01:31:27,135 --> 01:31:30,975
Speaker 2:  bulb mode. Now those work with any smart bulbs. Correct. Those aren't just,

1405
01:31:31,485 --> 01:31:35,055
Speaker 2:  they don't, 'cause Inno Valley doesn't make their own bulbs so Correct.

1406
01:31:35,145 --> 01:31:36,855
Speaker 2:  Those would work with any smart bulbs.

1407
01:31:36,855 --> 01:31:40,375
Speaker 10:  Yeah, it, it works with whatever smart bulb is Move is working with your

1408
01:31:40,865 --> 01:31:44,535
Speaker 10:  controller system of choice, which would either be something through ZigBee

1409
01:31:44,955 --> 01:31:45,975
Speaker 10:  Z-Wave or Matter.

1410
01:31:46,915 --> 01:31:49,855
Speaker 2:  And then of course the other solution if you're handy or you're getting an

1411
01:31:50,095 --> 01:31:52,455
Speaker 2:  electrician to do all of this is the relays that we talked about earlier.

1412
01:31:52,915 --> 01:31:56,575
Speaker 2:  And those would connect your smart bulbs through regular switches to any

1413
01:31:56,575 --> 01:31:59,780
Speaker 2:  smart platform that you like. Shelly being one of the options that a Cara

1414
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:03,605
Speaker 2:  also has relays too. So hopefully there's some solutions

1415
01:32:03,605 --> 01:32:07,485
Speaker 2:  there for you Nicholas. And we are going to jump to another question.

1416
01:32:08,195 --> 01:32:11,845
Speaker 2:  This one is another, another Hue and

1417
01:32:11,975 --> 01:32:15,885
Speaker 2:  Aqara one. This one is another bit bit of a head scratcher

1418
01:32:16,025 --> 01:32:19,765
Speaker 2:  and it's an interesting one to kind of follow on from this last question.

1419
01:32:20,315 --> 01:32:24,245
Speaker 2:  This is from Simon Salvin and this is his question is I have

1420
01:32:24,465 --> 01:32:28,445
Speaker 2:  Hue Lighting and a Cara Wireless switches. These are all

1421
01:32:28,545 --> 01:32:32,285
Speaker 2:  set up through the Apple Home app and the switches can be temperamental at

1422
01:32:32,285 --> 01:32:36,125
Speaker 2:  times. I see. I can add the Hue bridge to Aqara

1423
01:32:36,385 --> 01:32:39,885
Speaker 2:  via matter, which I'm thinking could give me greater control setup in the

1424
01:32:39,975 --> 01:32:43,845
Speaker 2:  Aqara app. Would you advise this and would this still keep all

1425
01:32:43,845 --> 01:32:47,365
Speaker 2:  the lights in the home app for controlling certain lights without

1426
01:32:47,805 --> 01:32:51,445
Speaker 2:  switches and automations already created? Although

1427
01:32:51,845 --> 01:32:55,525
Speaker 2:  I have the Aqara M two hub, he points out

1428
01:32:56,065 --> 01:32:59,445
Speaker 2:  and he asks should I be able to pair the Hugh hub to that

1429
01:32:59,675 --> 01:33:03,605
Speaker 2:  without matter. I'm sorry, this one is quite complicated

1430
01:33:04,785 --> 01:33:08,685
Speaker 2:  and I'm, I did reach out to a carer just to make sure we got this one

1431
01:33:08,685 --> 01:33:12,445
Speaker 2:  right. Yep. And you know, this goes to what we talked about before

1432
01:33:12,615 --> 01:33:16,485
Speaker 2:  about how matter can sort of help you integrate smart lighting

1433
01:33:16,835 --> 01:33:20,685
Speaker 2:  from different brands. Because what a carer has done recently and

1434
01:33:20,685 --> 01:33:23,845
Speaker 2:  the same as Ikea as we mentioned at the top of the show, is they've become

1435
01:33:23,845 --> 01:33:27,765
Speaker 2:  matter controllers which allows you to add any matter

1436
01:33:27,765 --> 01:33:31,605
Speaker 2:  devices to their ecosystem. Just as you add the huge bridge

1437
01:33:31,865 --> 01:33:35,525
Speaker 2:  to your Apple home ecosystem, you can add anything to

1438
01:33:35,765 --> 01:33:39,485
Speaker 2:  a carer and now IKEA and control through their app

1439
01:33:39,485 --> 01:33:43,445
Speaker 2:  rather than through Apple Home. The question is here though, can you

1440
01:33:43,445 --> 01:33:47,205
Speaker 2:  connect a Hub Bridge to an a car matter controller? You can definitely do

1441
01:33:47,205 --> 01:33:50,965
Speaker 2:  that through Matter, but you can't, I'm afraid Simon do it with the

1442
01:33:51,165 --> 01:33:55,045
Speaker 2:  M two hub, it only works with the M three hub and

1443
01:33:55,045 --> 01:33:58,925
Speaker 2:  this is where matter has been a bit difficult for people because there

1444
01:33:58,925 --> 01:34:02,765
Speaker 2:  had been hope that much of the support from older devices would exist

1445
01:34:03,395 --> 01:34:07,045
Speaker 2:  with matter. But unfortunately that has not been the case and a lot of companies

1446
01:34:07,045 --> 01:34:10,245
Speaker 2:  have come out with newer devices like a car has come out with its M three

1447
01:34:10,305 --> 01:34:14,285
Speaker 2:  hub, which does support being a matter controller. The M

1448
01:34:14,285 --> 01:34:18,085
Speaker 2:  two hub supports matter but not as being a controller.

1449
01:34:19,105 --> 01:34:22,365
Speaker 2:  I'm getting into the weeds a little bit here, but if you do this, if you

1450
01:34:22,365 --> 01:34:25,845
Speaker 2:  connect your HU Bridge to the matter controller, a car matter controller,

1451
01:34:25,985 --> 01:34:29,725
Speaker 2:  you'll be able to control the HU Lights in the A Carra home app

1452
01:34:30,265 --> 01:34:33,605
Speaker 2:  and automate them with a Cara's excellent automation engine.

1453
01:34:34,265 --> 01:34:38,245
Speaker 2:  But you cannot then control them via

1454
01:34:38,245 --> 01:34:42,045
Speaker 2:  Apple Home. If you just integrate them into a carra

1455
01:34:42,785 --> 01:34:46,765
Speaker 2:  you to control them in Apple Home, you would need

1456
01:34:46,785 --> 01:34:50,565
Speaker 2:  to generate a matter code in the Aqara Home

1457
01:34:50,585 --> 01:34:54,325
Speaker 2:  app and use that code to add the hub bridge to Apple

1458
01:34:54,355 --> 01:34:58,085
Speaker 2:  Home. This is using matter's multi multimin feature

1459
01:34:58,275 --> 01:35:02,245
Speaker 2:  that we haven't touched on, but this is one of the, the things that makes

1460
01:35:02,345 --> 01:35:06,045
Speaker 2:  matter interoperable. It allows you to use

1461
01:35:06,145 --> 01:35:09,685
Speaker 2:  any matter device with any matter compatible platform,

1462
01:35:09,815 --> 01:35:13,765
Speaker 2:  which is great for smart lighting, especially if you live in a house

1463
01:35:13,765 --> 01:35:14,685
Speaker 2:  that's divided.

1464
01:35:16,305 --> 01:35:20,285
Speaker 2:  Yep. So your spouse has an Android phone and you have an iPhone

1465
01:35:20,305 --> 01:35:24,245
Speaker 2:  and he wants to talk to Google and you want to talk to Siri. And this is

1466
01:35:24,245 --> 01:35:27,885
Speaker 2:  one of the great features of Matter, although it's been a little spotty

1467
01:35:28,225 --> 01:35:31,405
Speaker 2:  to start with, it does seem to be getting better. And I've found recently

1468
01:35:31,795 --> 01:35:35,325
Speaker 2:  when I've tried adding matter devices from one

1469
01:35:35,355 --> 01:35:39,085
Speaker 2:  ecosystem to another that it has started to work a lot more

1470
01:35:39,325 --> 01:35:42,245
Speaker 2:  smoothly, which is, which is exciting. Is this something that you've spent

1471
01:35:42,245 --> 01:35:45,845
Speaker 2:  much time doing or do you just stick everything with Stick with everything

1472
01:35:45,845 --> 01:35:46,485
Speaker 2:  in Apple Home?

1473
01:35:47,745 --> 01:35:51,725
Speaker 10:  I'm trying to keep most everything in Apple Home, but one thing

1474
01:35:51,725 --> 01:35:55,285
Speaker 10:  that I did wanna address here is, you know it, it's easy to get frustrated

1475
01:35:55,285 --> 01:35:59,165
Speaker 10:  that the hub that you've invested in isn't necessarily gonna

1476
01:35:59,165 --> 01:36:02,365
Speaker 10:  support the new features before anyone gets

1477
01:36:02,505 --> 01:36:06,365
Speaker 10:  conspiratorial about that. That's almost always because of the

1478
01:36:06,365 --> 01:36:10,285
Speaker 10:  capabilities of the chip set in the hub. Yeah.

1479
01:36:10,545 --> 01:36:14,205
Speaker 10:  For this controller capability it does require,

1480
01:36:14,665 --> 01:36:18,445
Speaker 10:  you know, more horsepower if you will to use an old fashioned term

1481
01:36:18,985 --> 01:36:22,845
Speaker 10:  and some of the old chips just can't support that. So yeah,

1482
01:36:22,935 --> 01:36:26,325
Speaker 10:  while some vendors were able to say, oh yeah, our current chip set will

1483
01:36:26,325 --> 01:36:29,685
Speaker 10:  support adding our devices into the matter

1484
01:36:29,875 --> 01:36:33,725
Speaker 10:  ecosystem, they weren't necessarily capable enough

1485
01:36:33,825 --> 01:36:37,365
Speaker 10:  to be a controller, which means stuff like running those routines

1486
01:36:37,705 --> 01:36:39,725
Speaker 10:  and making all of those connections. So

1487
01:36:40,325 --> 01:36:43,695
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. And like the M two does support matter as a bridge,

1488
01:36:44,045 --> 01:36:46,975
Speaker 2:  it's just not gonna be a controller. Right. And that's the, and this is something

1489
01:36:46,975 --> 01:36:50,615
Speaker 2:  that we're only starting to see recently is companies turning their

1490
01:36:50,965 --> 01:36:54,775
Speaker 2:  hubs into controllers and it's gonna be interesting to see, 'cause

1491
01:36:54,795 --> 01:36:58,295
Speaker 2:  you know, In theory you could set everything up now in your smart home

1492
01:36:58,885 --> 01:37:02,535
Speaker 2:  with a carer or IKEA and not need to use Apple or Google or

1493
01:37:02,595 --> 01:37:06,415
Speaker 2:  Amazon if you don't want, which may appeal to people, especially

1494
01:37:06,415 --> 01:37:10,255
Speaker 2:  as you can do all of both of those systems work

1495
01:37:10,255 --> 01:37:14,135
Speaker 2:  locally. They both rely heavily on ZigBee And I, Cara does

1496
01:37:14,135 --> 01:37:17,815
Speaker 2:  have thread and Ikea it sounds like is also gonna be working

1497
01:37:17,845 --> 01:37:21,735
Speaker 2:  with Thread so that it, it's nice to have these options, especially if you're

1498
01:37:21,735 --> 01:37:25,495
Speaker 2:  only interested in lighting. I think if you don't need all of the other stuff.

1499
01:37:25,955 --> 01:37:29,695
Speaker 2:  And these, as we've pointed out, IKEA and Aqara do have pretty

1500
01:37:30,135 --> 01:37:34,055
Speaker 2:  powerful automation systems for lighting. So it's exciting

1501
01:37:34,055 --> 01:37:37,935
Speaker 2:  to see this. This is kind of one of the reasons behind matter too. So it's

1502
01:37:38,135 --> 01:37:40,975
Speaker 2:  exciting to see that with companies start to do this. I think the other one

1503
01:37:40,975 --> 01:37:44,615
Speaker 2:  that has done it is Flick, have you had much experience with Flick devices?

1504
01:37:44,995 --> 01:37:48,575
Speaker 10:  You know, I had used Flick in its first

1505
01:37:48,865 --> 01:37:52,695
Speaker 10:  generation and just haven't kept up with it as it's evolved.

1506
01:37:52,965 --> 01:37:55,885
Speaker 10:  It's grown into something quite powerful actually.

1507
01:37:56,865 --> 01:38:00,845
Speaker 2:  Yes. And their latest device is a dial. And this is something that I really

1508
01:38:00,845 --> 01:38:04,685
Speaker 2:  want to see more of in smart lighting because having that that you said

1509
01:38:04,685 --> 01:38:08,565
Speaker 2:  earlier, the physical controls are so important, they still are

1510
01:38:08,595 --> 01:38:11,725
Speaker 2:  like, I think it's important to remember that when you have smart home and

1511
01:38:11,725 --> 01:38:15,165
Speaker 2:  smart lighting, that doesn't mean you don't need switches anymore, right?

1512
01:38:15,165 --> 01:38:18,885
Speaker 2:  It's just that your switches can now do so much more. Potentially

1513
01:38:18,955 --> 01:38:22,845
Speaker 2:  they, they, yes, potentially. And being able to sort of dial up

1514
01:38:22,865 --> 01:38:26,765
Speaker 2:  the light and brightness but also be able to press a button and turn

1515
01:38:26,765 --> 01:38:30,685
Speaker 2:  to your movie time scene or have everything turn to the colors of your favorite

1516
01:38:31,045 --> 01:38:35,005
Speaker 2:  football team with just a tap. Those kind of features with physical

1517
01:38:35,005 --> 01:38:38,085
Speaker 2:  controls, you know, what makes smart lighting really fun, I think. Yep.

1518
01:38:39,765 --> 01:38:43,605
Speaker 2:  Excellent. Okay, so I think we've got time for one more quick one, which

1519
01:38:43,705 --> 01:38:47,245
Speaker 2:  is along the same lines as we've been talking about here. Now that we dived

1520
01:38:47,245 --> 01:38:51,125
Speaker 2:  into matter. I managed, we managed to get quite far without too much matter

1521
01:38:51,675 --> 01:38:55,525
Speaker 2:  chat, which David would be proud of. But the

1522
01:38:55,525 --> 01:38:59,165
Speaker 2:  last one here is from Res Gore and

1523
01:38:59,345 --> 01:39:03,285
Speaker 2:  he wanted, he's asking about thread border routers. So I'm looking for

1524
01:39:03,325 --> 01:39:07,005
Speaker 2:  a thread border router to improve my matter smart home setup.

1525
01:39:07,745 --> 01:39:11,285
Speaker 2:  Is it still worth buying something like the Google Nest Mini

1526
01:39:11,625 --> 01:39:15,605
Speaker 2:  two from 2020 given that it's already more than

1527
01:39:15,605 --> 01:39:19,365
Speaker 2:  four years old? I'm unsure if Google plans to launch a newer version.

1528
01:39:19,825 --> 01:39:23,445
Speaker 2:  The reason I ask is that a few of my matter enabled devices aren't

1529
01:39:23,685 --> 01:39:27,205
Speaker 2:  controllable via Apple HomeKit and considering series

1530
01:39:27,365 --> 01:39:31,285
Speaker 2:  current limitations, I'm hesitant to invest in a home

1531
01:39:31,465 --> 01:39:35,245
Speaker 2:  pod mini. There's so many things we could unpack from that.

1532
01:39:35,775 --> 01:39:39,205
Speaker 2:  First of all, is Nest making any more hardware? And second of all, what's

1533
01:39:39,205 --> 01:39:43,165
Speaker 2:  going on with Siri, right? But the very first question answer I'm gonna

1534
01:39:43,165 --> 01:39:46,645
Speaker 2:  give you is no, do not buy a Google Nest mini two. Don't, don't, don't, don't.

1535
01:39:46,985 --> 01:39:50,725
Speaker 2:  Mainly because it's not a thread border route. So it will not help

1536
01:39:52,105 --> 01:39:56,045
Speaker 2:  if you're gonna go by any Google device right now to help with your

1537
01:39:56,045 --> 01:39:59,605
Speaker 2:  thread network. And this is, we mentioned earlier, thread is a smart home

1538
01:39:59,885 --> 01:40:03,325
Speaker 2:  protocol. A lot of lighting runs on it. It's one of the main

1539
01:40:03,765 --> 01:40:07,205
Speaker 2:  protocols used by Matter. Google has

1540
01:40:07,645 --> 01:40:10,685
Speaker 2:  a number of different devices and we'll include a link into the show notes

1541
01:40:10,785 --> 01:40:14,645
Speaker 2:  for the ones that are matter controllers and thread border routers.

1542
01:40:14,865 --> 01:40:18,325
Speaker 2:  But my suggestion would be to buy the Google TV streamer 4K,

1543
01:40:18,615 --> 01:40:22,565
Speaker 2:  which is their most recent product. So it is newer, it's not five years

1544
01:40:22,585 --> 01:40:26,045
Speaker 2:  old and it also doubles as a great streaming device.

1545
01:40:26,555 --> 01:40:29,645
Speaker 2:  I've been using it, wrote a review of it, which we will also link in the

1546
01:40:29,645 --> 01:40:33,445
Speaker 2:  show notes and it's a perfect solution even

1547
01:40:33,445 --> 01:40:36,445
Speaker 2:  if you have a device you'd like to use for your tv now you could just plug

1548
01:40:36,445 --> 01:40:40,285
Speaker 2:  this in and use it as a thread border router. It doesn't have smart speaker

1549
01:40:40,285 --> 01:40:43,525
Speaker 2:  capabilities though, So if you were looking for something that you could

1550
01:40:43,525 --> 01:40:47,365
Speaker 2:  talk to and the best option right now would probably be the Nest

1551
01:40:47,945 --> 01:40:51,925
Speaker 2:  Hub two. So the one that is not quite as old,

1552
01:40:51,965 --> 01:40:55,565
Speaker 2:  I think that's like 2023. That is also a thread border

1553
01:40:55,585 --> 01:40:59,005
Speaker 2:  router. What would you suggest here, Richard? Do you think

1554
01:40:59,665 --> 01:41:03,565
Speaker 2:  having more thread border routers will help his Matt Smart Home

1555
01:41:03,625 --> 01:41:04,005
Speaker 2:  set up?

1556
01:41:04,845 --> 01:41:08,325
Speaker 10:  Honestly the, the thing that concerns me is that it sounds like

1557
01:41:08,755 --> 01:41:11,445
Speaker 10:  current control is

1558
01:41:12,515 --> 01:41:16,005
Speaker 10:  through, well, I don't know, I can't tell if control is through

1559
01:41:16,495 --> 01:41:20,205
Speaker 10:  Apple Home or Google Home. And so that's one of the things

1560
01:41:20,225 --> 01:41:23,965
Speaker 10:  that's, that's hard to understand because they mentioned both

1561
01:41:24,995 --> 01:41:28,975
Speaker 10:  the Home pod and the Google Nest Mini, I'm not

1562
01:41:28,975 --> 01:41:32,895
Speaker 10:  sure what ecosystem they're hoping to

1563
01:41:32,895 --> 01:41:36,815
Speaker 10:  stay in. Yeah, I understand the hesitation to drop 99 bucks

1564
01:41:37,075 --> 01:41:41,055
Speaker 10:  on a HomePod mini. One thing that you might

1565
01:41:41,245 --> 01:41:45,135
Speaker 10:  want to consider is looking on eBay or on

1566
01:41:45,135 --> 01:41:48,775
Speaker 10:  marketplace for folks that are getting

1567
01:41:48,955 --> 01:41:52,855
Speaker 10:  rid of old home pod minis, I, I think you, oh yeah,

1568
01:41:53,205 --> 01:41:57,095
Speaker 10:  it's not that hard to find this stuff secondhand and you can do

1569
01:41:57,455 --> 01:42:01,255
Speaker 10:  a full wipe and then incorporate them into your

1570
01:42:01,255 --> 01:42:05,015
Speaker 10:  home. I, I mean you mentioned the 4K streaming

1571
01:42:05,015 --> 01:42:08,415
Speaker 10:  device, that's a hundred dollars investment. That's the same price that

1572
01:42:08,415 --> 01:42:10,095
Speaker 10:  is as the HomePod mini, but

1573
01:42:10,095 --> 01:42:11,455
Speaker 2:  It does more. It does,

1574
01:42:12,075 --> 01:42:15,575
Speaker 10:  It does. And I love Google tv. I'm a big fan. So if that's something yeah.

1575
01:42:15,575 --> 01:42:19,015
Speaker 10:  That you have in your home and and might wanna upgrade, that could be the

1576
01:42:19,015 --> 01:42:19,535
Speaker 10:  perfect answer.

1577
01:42:20,605 --> 01:42:23,585
Speaker 2:  And it does. I said it doesn't have a speaker in it as a, it's not like a

1578
01:42:23,585 --> 01:42:27,305
Speaker 2:  smart speaker, but you can use the remote to talk to the Google

1579
01:42:27,305 --> 01:42:31,185
Speaker 2:  assistant and control smart home devices through that. It also has

1580
01:42:31,225 --> 01:42:34,185
Speaker 2:  a great little smart home panel that will pop out while you're watching tv,

1581
01:42:34,585 --> 01:42:38,225
Speaker 2:  compress a button and control your devices through that. But yes, I agree.

1582
01:42:38,525 --> 01:42:42,185
Speaker 2:  The idea here is you've got two ecosystems and which ones do you wanna be

1583
01:42:42,185 --> 01:42:46,145
Speaker 2:  in? And I use both of these ecosystems. So you know, and this is again

1584
01:42:46,145 --> 01:42:49,225
Speaker 2:  where matter is helping because I, you know, you can have everything in both

1585
01:42:49,745 --> 01:42:53,105
Speaker 2:  and control one thing using your Google TV remote

1586
01:42:53,645 --> 01:42:57,585
Speaker 2:  and say, trigger my movie scene. But then you can also do that on your

1587
01:42:57,585 --> 01:43:00,945
Speaker 2:  iPhone through your Apple Home app or through the control panel.

1588
01:43:01,415 --> 01:43:04,825
Speaker 2:  It's nice to be able to have that flexibility. We're starting to see more

1589
01:43:04,825 --> 01:43:08,505
Speaker 2:  and more of that with matter. But just to wrap up the thread

1590
01:43:08,745 --> 01:43:12,545
Speaker 2:  question here, having a thread border router is important

1591
01:43:12,605 --> 01:43:16,425
Speaker 2:  for your matter set up. If you do not have one, I recommend getting one

1592
01:43:16,425 --> 01:43:19,905
Speaker 2:  because if you do not have a thread border router, you cannot use thread

1593
01:43:19,905 --> 01:43:23,785
Speaker 2:  devices in your smart home. You can use matter over wifi, but you cannot

1594
01:43:23,845 --> 01:43:26,745
Speaker 2:  use thread devices. And there are a lot of great new thread devices out there,

1595
01:43:26,835 --> 01:43:30,745
Speaker 2:  especially in the smart lighting space. And you only need a

1596
01:43:30,745 --> 01:43:34,545
Speaker 2:  thread one thread border router technically more will help because they

1597
01:43:34,545 --> 01:43:37,865
Speaker 2:  create, they're part of a mesh network and if one goes down, the other one

1598
01:43:37,895 --> 01:43:41,705
Speaker 2:  will pick up. So to the point about failures in the smart home,

1599
01:43:41,845 --> 01:43:45,785
Speaker 2:  having more than one thread, border router will help. But

1600
01:43:45,785 --> 01:43:49,225
Speaker 2:  you do not need to have a thread border router from the smart home platform

1601
01:43:49,225 --> 01:43:52,565
Speaker 2:  that you are using. Right. But yes, if you're using Apple Home and you add

1602
01:43:52,645 --> 01:43:56,605
Speaker 2:  a Google Home streamer, you are adding a thread border router

1603
01:43:56,665 --> 01:44:00,485
Speaker 2:  to your network, whether or not it is an Apple home device. So

1604
01:44:00,485 --> 01:44:03,645
Speaker 2:  you are, you are supporting your, your network and you're making it stronger.

1605
01:44:04,105 --> 01:44:07,165
Speaker 2:  One of the problems with thread border routers right now is when you add

1606
01:44:07,245 --> 01:44:11,045
Speaker 2:  a new one to your home, it could create its

1607
01:44:11,045 --> 01:44:14,965
Speaker 2:  own network, which would not help you. The good

1608
01:44:14,965 --> 01:44:18,365
Speaker 2:  news is that Apple and Google are some of the companies that have actually

1609
01:44:18,795 --> 01:44:22,725
Speaker 2:  done a good job at connecting their networks together. So

1610
01:44:22,825 --> 01:44:26,405
Speaker 2:  you probably would be fine in this instance, it's Amazon and

1611
01:44:26,715 --> 01:44:30,365
Speaker 2:  eero and smart things that are still a little

1612
01:44:30,595 --> 01:44:34,085
Speaker 2:  lagging in terms of making one healthy board router

1613
01:44:34,265 --> 01:44:38,205
Speaker 2:  thread network when you add your devices. So as I've written

1614
01:44:38,205 --> 01:44:42,125
Speaker 2:  about recently, this is something that all of the thread manufacturers

1615
01:44:42,125 --> 01:44:46,045
Speaker 2:  are working on. And with the one do four release, which is

1616
01:44:46,245 --> 01:44:50,085
Speaker 2:  out now by next year, I'm told this

1617
01:44:50,085 --> 01:44:53,925
Speaker 2:  shouldn't be a problem anymore. So as has been the theme of this

1618
01:44:53,955 --> 01:44:56,525
Speaker 2:  episode, just wait and everything's gonna get better.

1619
01:44:59,505 --> 01:45:03,285
Speaker 2:  But I thank you so much, Richard, for your time and expertise.

1620
01:45:03,435 --> 01:45:07,325
Speaker 2:  It's been really fun having you on. And any last pieces of

1621
01:45:07,325 --> 01:45:10,245
Speaker 2:  advice you'd like to leave for our readers when it comes to smart lighting?

1622
01:45:10,855 --> 01:45:12,285
Speaker 2:  Sorry for our listeners.

1623
01:45:12,755 --> 01:45:16,445
Speaker 10:  Yeah, I, I, I think the, the thing that I would

1624
01:45:16,555 --> 01:45:20,205
Speaker 10:  just say is, you know, if you're hearing all of this

1625
01:45:20,825 --> 01:45:24,565
Speaker 10:  and you're thinking, geez, maybe I should just wait till I do anything.

1626
01:45:25,115 --> 01:45:28,285
Speaker 10:  Yeah, I don't know that you really need to go that far. I think there are

1627
01:45:28,285 --> 01:45:31,965
Speaker 10:  some good solutions out there that are not universally but

1628
01:45:31,965 --> 01:45:35,885
Speaker 10:  largely compatible with most of the ecosystems and with matter.

1629
01:45:36,305 --> 01:45:39,685
Speaker 10:  And so it's a really good place to start and most of the devices that are

1630
01:45:39,685 --> 01:45:43,285
Speaker 10:  available now are going to, you know, take you

1631
01:45:43,635 --> 01:45:46,925
Speaker 10:  many years into the future. Yeah. The thing that I would be

1632
01:45:47,645 --> 01:45:51,325
Speaker 10:  cautious of is that inclination to say,

1633
01:45:51,425 --> 01:45:55,365
Speaker 10:  oh, but here on Amazon I can get four of those bulbs for the same

1634
01:45:55,365 --> 01:45:58,885
Speaker 10:  price as this one from Hugh or Govie or

1635
01:45:59,675 --> 01:46:03,205
Speaker 10:  name the more well-known vendor. There's a reason

1636
01:46:03,205 --> 01:46:06,805
Speaker 10:  they're so inexpensive and in my

1637
01:46:06,805 --> 01:46:10,165
Speaker 10:  experience, a lot of those lower price,

1638
01:46:10,465 --> 01:46:14,405
Speaker 10:  lesser known brands are not gonna last as well or not gonna

1639
01:46:14,405 --> 01:46:18,325
Speaker 10:  future as well. And you'll be fighting

1640
01:46:18,475 --> 01:46:20,325
Speaker 10:  more problems than solving them.

1641
01:46:20,835 --> 01:46:24,765
Speaker 2:  Very good advice. Yes, it's worth investing a little bit of money into smart

1642
01:46:24,925 --> 01:46:28,845
Speaker 2:  lighting. It pays off in dividends and far less headaches when it comes to

1643
01:46:28,845 --> 01:46:32,405
Speaker 2:  setting everything up and troubleshooting in my experience. So, yep.

1644
01:46:32,675 --> 01:46:36,645
Speaker 2:  Wise words. Richard, very much appreciate your time this week. Thank you
