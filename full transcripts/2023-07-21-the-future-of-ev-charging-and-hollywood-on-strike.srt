16
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,950
Speaker 4:  What's your favorite brand of washer fluid call the hotline.

17
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:37,840
Speaker 5:  Is it just Windex?

18
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,810
Speaker 4:  Does anyone have a favorite brand? Actually, I'm dying to know. Is there

19
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,170
Speaker 4:  an iOS versus Android of windshield washer fluid?

20
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,140
Speaker 5:  A hundred percent. There is a hundred percent.

21
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,970
Speaker 4:  Email us. No, no,

22
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,530
Speaker 1:  No. Sorry. Just email nili specifically. Please don't email any of the rest

23
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,510
Speaker 1:  of us.

24
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,490
Speaker 4:  The, the Rain X fan Boys are coming. Hi, I'm your friend. Neli.

25
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,770
Speaker 4:  That's David Pierce. Hi. Alex. Cranz is

26
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,530
Speaker 5:  Here. I'm also here. I think just Windex is fine. Like I think you just

27
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,810
Speaker 5:  pour that in. It's, it's okay.

28
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,130
Speaker 4:  Just raw Windex. Just

29
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,490
Speaker 5:  Raw Windex. Just that raw. I feel like a mechanic once told me never do

30
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,410
Speaker 5:  that. But I also think he's not here. And I don't remember his name,

31
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,150
Speaker 5:  so it's probably fine. Yeah,

32
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,600
Speaker 4:  If you forget a guy, what he said is definitely wrong.

33
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,950
Speaker 5:  Yeah, that's how this works.

34
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,670
Speaker 4:  All right, well go ahead and pour some raw Windex into your windshield foot.

35
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,130
Speaker 4:  I'm just trying to, like, on Instagram threads the other day, you know the

36
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,550
Speaker 4:  platform is rife with engagement. Ba Adam Sary straight up was like, Android

37
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,530
Speaker 4:  is better than iOS. In response to Marquez, Brownley a

38
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,280
Speaker 4:  million responses. I put that in a quick post on our site

39
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,650
Speaker 4:  just to make a joke about Instagram engagement bait being out of

40
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,570
Speaker 4:  control. And then that post got 40 comments about

41
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:47,550
Speaker 4:  Android versus iOS. It's, it's just the easiest thing we can

42
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,390
Speaker 4:  do. I'll say it right now. Android's better than iOS. Leave a comment on

43
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,330
Speaker 4:  YouTube. Boost that algo. It works every time. I

44
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,930
Speaker 4:  got you. I'm just saying is does that exist for windshield

45
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,120
Speaker 4:  washer fluid?

46
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,780
Speaker 5:  It has to

47
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,420
Speaker 4:  Because it exists for things like blenders. you

48
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,160
Speaker 5:  Know, it exists,

49
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,200
Speaker 4:  Has shark versus Vitamix. You can get into it.

50
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,140
Speaker 5:  It exists for like car leather cleaner,

51
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,340
Speaker 4:  I, Meg Wes versus

52
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,140
Speaker 5:  Something else. Maybe follow some, some car detailers, and

53
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,540
Speaker 5:  it's like ASMR for me. It's just like, oh, that's so soothing. And they're

54
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,100
Speaker 5:  like, this is the one you want to use. Somebody tells you another one. It's

55
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,050
Speaker 5:  garbage

56
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,480
Speaker 6:  Alex. Are you talking about the videos where they, they do the like super

57
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,420
Speaker 6:  cut of them just like wiping all the dirt off the cars. you

58
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,420
Speaker 6:  know, those are always like six different cars that they do that to. And

59
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,300
Speaker 6:  it's just a full lie. No, this

60
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,400
Speaker 5:  Is always one car.

61
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,420
Speaker 6:  No, no. You're just being lied to the thing. Alex, I'm really sorry to be

62
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,630
Speaker 6:  the one to break this to. Oh,

63
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,660
Speaker 4:  David is finally like, it's all the same. Both operating systems are the

64
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,970
Speaker 4:  same. Yeah. Here's what I want. I want a list of

65
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,940
Speaker 4:  vitriolic consumer product debates. So you got, you

66
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,760
Speaker 4:  got your Xbox versus PlayStation. That's N number one.

67
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,460
Speaker 4:  Dan, I think number two is iOS versus

68
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,230
Speaker 4:  Android. Miele versus I think Windows. Windows versus Mac has actually

69
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,150
Speaker 4:  fallen off. I think that's like, no one cares anymore. Like you walk into

70
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,910
Speaker 4:  a, a room full of people using Windows and you're like, I have a Mac. And

71
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,900
Speaker 4:  everyone's like, we know.

72
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,390
Speaker 6:  Yeah. They all just sort of shook hands and walked away. Like I think that's,

73
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,830
Speaker 6:  that's basically over. Yeah.

74
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,300
Speaker 4:  Like they all have iPhones.

75
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,150
Speaker 6:  Yeah, but

76
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,390
Speaker 5:  I think Miele versus Dyson, I would say that's probably one. Oh, that's good.

77
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,260
Speaker 5:  I feel like people have strong opinions about which $600 vacuum cleaner.

78
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,650
Speaker 5:  Yeah. They came for

79
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,570
Speaker 4:  And all of them are far outdone by sharks. I'm just letting you know.

80
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,150
Speaker 4:  All right. That's enough of this. It's

81
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:27,710
Speaker 5:  The Linux of

82
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,240
Speaker 4:  Vacuums. But I, I'm dying to know this is your engagement bait homework.

83
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,630
Speaker 4:  Leave it in a comment on the, on the post, on the CI or on YouTube or wherever

84
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,590
Speaker 4:  you're listening. What's your number one silly

85
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,750
Speaker 4:  consumer product battle? And you can't pick iOS versus Android. You can't

86
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,530
Speaker 4:  pick Xbox versus PlayStation or Windows versus Mac. We know, we know.

87
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:45,990
Speaker 4:  No Marvel

88
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,470
Speaker 5:  Versus dc. That's

89
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,980
Speaker 4:  Not, is that even a fight? No,

90
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,280
Speaker 6:  It's just Marvel versus Zack Snyder's box of

91
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,080
Speaker 6:  movie

92
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,190

96
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,460
Speaker 5:  It's true too. It's still true.

97
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,970

108
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,280
Speaker 4:  this week. Starting of course with the latest photo of the Cybertruck

109
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,030
Speaker 4:  wiper, which we'll get to. That's how this all started.

110
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,580
Speaker 4:  There's new beat Studio Pro headphones that are really interesting. Actually.

111
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,060
Speaker 4:  There's some charging news from Tesla. Really interesting Laptop comparisons

112

Speaker 4:  for Monica that we should get into. Then Hollywood's on strike. Yep.

113
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,610
Speaker 5:  No movies

114
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,360
Speaker 4:  Because of streaming services. It just says TREE LAW and all capital letters.

115
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,620
Speaker 4:  And the rundown here. Dying to know what that means. Netflix had earnings,

116
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,630
Speaker 4:  then we got a lightning round. So's sorry. Some gadgets. It's been a minute

117
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,350
Speaker 4:  since we just sat in Gadget World. What do you think? Start with the Beats.

118
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,760
Speaker 6:  Let's do Beats first. Yeah.

119
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,320
Speaker 4:  I'm fascinated by these headphones. Me too.

120
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,330
Speaker 5:  Why? I'm not Please explain.

121
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,320
Speaker 6:  Okay, Cranz here. Here's the, here's the big question. I've been debating

122
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,980
Speaker 6:  for like 36 hours now since I first saw this review. So the thing about these

123
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,130
Speaker 6:  headphones, they're the Beats Studio Pro headphones. They're Beats latest

124
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,410
Speaker 6:  over the ear headphones. They have some cool upgrades. They have transparency

125
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,890
Speaker 6:  mode. They have Lossless U S B C audio. They look

126
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,700
Speaker 6:  exactly the same as the old beads, headphones. And Chris

127
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,840
Speaker 6:  Welch who wrote a review, it's very good. We'll put it in the show notes.

128
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,020
Speaker 6:  You can feel him in this review trying to decide if that's a good thing or

129
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,060
Speaker 6:  a bad thing. That it's like, there's nothing wrong with this design, but

130
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,960
Speaker 6:  they look like the old headphones. Is that bad?

131
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,220
Speaker 6:  And I. Wanna know what you guys think? Like, I think this is Beats is a very

132
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,020
Speaker 6:  good design. They make good headphones like LeBron James wears them. That's

133
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,540
Speaker 6:  all great. Beats has good reasons for not changing it. Is this like an old

134
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,060
Speaker 6:  design that needs to die or once you nail it, do you just never mess with

135
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,840
Speaker 6:  it again?

136
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,780
Speaker 5:  Ooh. That's interesting. Okay. Nevermind. These are interesting, right? I

137
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,620
Speaker 5:  like, I wanna debate that,

138
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,980
Speaker 4:  That cause the feature set is really wild for

139
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,940
Speaker 4:  Apple. Apple supporting Lossless u s BBC

140
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,640
Speaker 4:  audio is bonkers

141
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,530
Speaker 6:  And it natively supports both iOS and Android. So it is in

142
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,140
Speaker 6:  most ways, feature wise, this is the best pair of headphones Apple

143
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,700
Speaker 6:  makes. Yeah. Like hands

144
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,620
Speaker 4:  Down. But, but do you know where you, what You can't get lossless u s BBC

145
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,530
Speaker 4:  audio off of an iPhone.

146
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:39,850
Speaker 4:  Like

147
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:40,140
Speaker 5:  What

148
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,020
Speaker 4:  About adapters? It's a, it's just a wild feature for them to support on these

149
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,550
Speaker 4:  headphones. But I'm utterly fascinated by the fact that Beats exists.

150
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,300
Speaker 4:  Apple has stuck with it. It's obviously a big market because they

151
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,770
Speaker 4:  sell so many phones to Android users and they are catering to Android users

152
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:57,570
Speaker 4:  with this sub-brand and they're building features that are

153
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:01,450
Speaker 4:  just off to the side of everything they're doing

154
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,500
Speaker 4:  with headphones in Apple. Well that's

155
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,570
Speaker 5:  How they, they get you in. You're like, wow, I really love the

156
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,620
Speaker 4:  Usbc. I don't I don't think you buy these headphones for, for Lossless U

157
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,770
Speaker 4:  US bbc. I'm the only person who's gonna buy them. It's me and The Vergecast

158
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,580
Speaker 4:  team. That's correct. That's the listener. We now call the listeners part

159
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,400
Speaker 4:  of the Team Vergecast listeners, And I are going to buy these headphones

160
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,940
Speaker 4:  for Lossless u uss BBC audio. No one jumps from there to a pair of

161
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,920
Speaker 4:  AirPods with utterly compressed Bluetooth audio. Like that's

162
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,620
Speaker 4:  not the path. So it's just the features here are going this

163
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,550
Speaker 4:  way. Well, Apple's doing spatial audio this way and it's, it's

164
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:38,300
Speaker 4:  Beats gets to be its own little thing. And I think they maybe just don't

165
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,080
Speaker 4:  have designers or Apple doesn't want to pay the money

166
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,970
Speaker 4:  for new tooling on the headphones. Or

167
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,690
Speaker 6:  There's nothing wrong with the design. Don't change it. Like,

168
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,900
Speaker 6:  like look at the pictures of these headphones and tell me what's wrong with

169
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,380
Speaker 6:  the design. Other than I've seen this before on an older pair of, of headphones.

170
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,180
Speaker 5:  I mean they look like beets and beets are inherently kind of ugly. And I

171
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,900
Speaker 5:  associate with cheapness. Because remember when the Beats used to stick weights

172
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,260
Speaker 5:  in there before Apple owned them, they'd stick weights in. Yeah. To make

173
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,520
Speaker 5:  'em more expensive. So that like, but you didn't change that after that happened.

174
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,500
Speaker 5:  so like at this point, beets as beets, that's the brand. I kinda like that

175
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,340
Speaker 5:  they didn't change it cuz like REOs and nobody's out there being

176
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,180
Speaker 5:  like, why aren't the REOs getting a whole new redesign? Yeah.

177
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,440
Speaker 6:  They're like made of wood and people like, well they sound good. That's fine.

178
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,290
Speaker 5:  Carved differently. Yeah.

179
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,940
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I think, I think Apple doesn't want these to get too much attention.

180
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,700
Speaker 4:  I I, I think they, they bought Beats for the music streaming service that

181
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,580
Speaker 4:  turned into Apple Music. They inherited a headphone company and

182
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,340
Speaker 4:  turning off free money is just, it's against everything Tim Cook stands for

183
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,700
Speaker 4:  in this world. And so if you can just like upgrade the headphones and keep

184
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,420
Speaker 4:  selling 'em at high margins inside the same case and what really what you've

185
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,300
Speaker 4:  changed is some chips and some software, you're gonna keep doing that

186
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,030
Speaker 4:  forever. Like I think that's what's happening here. But I, does Apple want

187
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,530
Speaker 4:  Beats to be a world conquering success? Like absolutely not.

188
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,180
Speaker 4:  They want AirPods Max to be a world conquering success. And it's probably

189
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,160
Speaker 4:  time. I bet they change the design of the AirPods Max before they change

190
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,340
Speaker 4:  design of Beats to

191
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,180
Speaker 5:  A hundred percent. But that's,

192
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,590
Speaker 6:  That's all interesting and probably true. But that's like a, that's a business

193
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:14,270
Speaker 6:  story, right? Does that make the headphones

194
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:18,260
Speaker 6:  worse in any meaning? Like should you not buy these headphones as a

195
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,000
Speaker 6:  result of that? That to me is really the question.

196
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,820
Speaker 5:  No, you should still buy 'em. I mean I personally think they're ugly, but

197
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,000
Speaker 5:  I would never buy them.

198
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,220
Speaker 6:  But you would've thought that about the last generation. Yeah.

199
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,020
Speaker 5:  I would've thought that about every generation. Yeah.

200
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,060
Speaker 6:  You're just not a Beats person. But

201
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,560
Speaker 5:  If you're, if you are a Beats person, I don't see why you should be like,

202
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,520
Speaker 5:  oh man, I really want, like, I want 'em to look more like Apple headphones

203
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,060
Speaker 5:  or Sony or something. Like, Sony changes theirs every few years and they're

204
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,680
Speaker 5:  always,

205
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,540
Speaker 4:  I'm skipping this generation. Okay, And I gotta wait like five years to

206
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,430
Speaker 5:  Upgrade my Sony bought this generation at an airport Texas

207
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,260
Speaker 5:  place cuz I was going on a trip. That's how they get you And. I got on the

208
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,060
Speaker 5:  plane and the battery on 'em is dead. Oh

209
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:55,180
Speaker 6:  No,

210
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,680
Speaker 5:  That's right. And, I can't return them because it was the airplane port.

211
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,370
Speaker 5:  That's right. So I gotta go deal with that. But they're terrible. But yeah,

212
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,130
Speaker 5:  like I bought 'em because the sound was better. I didn't really

213
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,530
Speaker 5:  care about the look of them.

214
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,220
Speaker 4:  Sure. And they're on your head. Yeah. It's, it's actually very hard to see

215
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,390
Speaker 4:  headphones that you are wearing. True. It's just one of those

216
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,660
Speaker 4:  facts. But look, these headphones are all really expensive. These are three

217
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,550
Speaker 4:  50 bucks. That 350 bucks has gotten you better and better

218
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,540
Speaker 4:  build quality over the years. So the Sonys that we

219
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,080
Speaker 4:  all talk about, the bows that we all talk about, the quiet comforts the money

220
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,020
Speaker 4:  has gotten you better headphones, better build quality, better materials

221
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,340
Speaker 4:  year on year. And with Beats it's like here they

222
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:39,080
Speaker 4:  are. The finish gets fingerprints on them the same as they ever did

223
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,820
Speaker 4:  to. I just think that to me, the discrepancy in the two

224
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,660
Speaker 4:  apple headphone ecosystems is utterly fascinating.

225
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,640
Speaker 5:  I love it.

226
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,960
Speaker 4:  And I. I think the reason the materials are have stayed, they're not cheap

227
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,730
Speaker 4:  but stayed cheap to manufacture because they're already manufactured at

228
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,690
Speaker 4:  scale is cuz Tim Cook is like 70%

229
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,900
Speaker 4:  margins. Let's go. That's why

230
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,680
Speaker 5:  I, that's why I like it. It's so indicative. Yeah. Of like

231
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,800
Speaker 5:  Tim Cook's Apple. Like Steve Jobs never would've let this happen,

232
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,160
Speaker 4:  Do you think? He says, let's go in meeting, let's go.

233
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,060
Speaker 5:  He doesn't like in the Mario Voice,

234
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,300
Speaker 4:  I would pay $1 million to hear Tim Cook do the Mario

235
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,530
Speaker 4:  voice.

236
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,210
Speaker 5:  Same.

237
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,780
Speaker 4:  Just putting that out there. I don't, I don't have it, you know, but I'll

238
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,150
Speaker 4:  get it.

239
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,000
Speaker 5:  We'll figure it out. We'll crowdfund that.

240
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,700
Speaker 4:  All right. Let's talk about some laptops real quick. Lots of Laptop news

241
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,660
Speaker 4:  this week. Shawn got to play at the Framework Laptop 16, which is the Framework

242
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,500
Speaker 4:  Laptop that has a discreet replaceable gpu. That's

243
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,620
Speaker 4:  really something

244
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,700
Speaker 6:  Everyone should go watch that video that he made and read his story by the

245
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,860
Speaker 6:  way. Because the joy that man felt in using this

246
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,500
Speaker 6:  computer was so wonderful. It's very cool. I mean the, the

247
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,380
Speaker 6:  Framework Laptop 16 is like the most modular Laptop I've ever seen.

248
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,300
Speaker 6:  Right. And and it's big thing is you can actually can is can we make modular

249
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,000
Speaker 6:  a verb? You can modular in a discreet

250
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,560
Speaker 6:  gpu and that's big and exciting and it seems to work and it's very cool.

251
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,540
Speaker 6:  But like you can just feel Sean being like, this is the computer I have been

252
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:06,140
Speaker 6:  dreaming of for so many years. And I mean it's, it just makes me so happy.

253
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,940
Speaker 6:  Everyone should go read that story and watch the video.

254
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,650
Speaker 5:  I like that it doesn't, for a while there, there were modular laptops

255
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,500
Speaker 5:  kind of like the area 51 m and, and a bunch of like

256
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,020
Speaker 5:  origin and, and folks would make their own versions and they all looked the

257
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,860
Speaker 5:  exact same. And that's, they were very deeply ugly and this one looks like

258
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,420
Speaker 5:  a nicer iteration of that. Yeah, it looks

259
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,740
Speaker 6:  Like a Laptop. Like who was to Framework for doing a good job of making a

260
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,480
Speaker 6:  modular Laptop that looks like a Laptop

261
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,460
Speaker 5:  But not like a gaming, like a cheap gaming Laptop. Yeah.

262
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,220
Speaker 5:  Like for a while there all the modular ones look like cheap gaming laptops

263
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,140
Speaker 5:  and now it's like, oh, I mean this is still not the most attractive thing

264
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,580
Speaker 5:  in the world. But that's what you, that's the exchange. You do, you get

265
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,170
Speaker 5:  modular, it's a little less attractive.

266
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:49,500
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah. Your GPU is two feet long and it weighs a hundred pounds. Like

267
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,640
Speaker 6:  you don't have, you're not gonna make an attractive computer out of that,

268
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,500
Speaker 6:  but, but that's okay. The, it is what it is and they seem to have

269
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,720
Speaker 6:  gotten almost everything else about it. Right. Which I think is very cool.

270
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,700
Speaker 6:  Yes. Framework in general I think is like a company worth rooting for for

271
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,580
Speaker 6:  a lot of reasons. And I think continues to be delivering

272
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,620
Speaker 6:  on the thing that it said it was going to do and a lot of people didn't think

273
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,680
Speaker 6:  it could pull off And I. Just think that's cool.

274
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,490
Speaker 4:  Let me just read you this sentence in response to that Sure statement. David,

275
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:20,290
Speaker 4:  this is Sean. My only regret is, I can't give you any idea how well it works

276
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:24,030
Speaker 4:  because Framework broke the fans on the only GPU module in the United

277
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,170
Speaker 4:  States. It's, it's fine prototypes. We were only

278
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,700
Speaker 4:  able to run a few smooth minutes of Eldon ring before the system began

279
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,580
Speaker 4:  throttling itself due to the utter lack of cooling.

280
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,540
Speaker 6:  I did enjoy that. The game was so sick and then I burned my house

281
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,600
Speaker 6:  down.

282
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,340
Speaker 4:  So they, they're shipping another one from

283
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,460
Speaker 4:  Taiwan. I'm just saying it's still a very complicated

284
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,400
Speaker 4:  problem. Yes. It's a very cool,

285
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,300
Speaker 6:  It is very I mean and cooling. That was a good pun. You just did by accident

286
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,240
Speaker 6:  there because the cooling seems to be the thing. And Sean actually talked

287
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,100
Speaker 6:  to one of the people who worked on the area 51 M and the big

288
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,090
Speaker 6:  thing is like, how do we get a GPU into this computer and

289
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:09,060
Speaker 6:  keep it and the computer cool. And so Framework has a different idea about,

290
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,000
Speaker 6:  you know, putting the fans in with the gpu. But that is

291
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,620
Speaker 6:  the question. Like that is the thing to solve to make this thing work. And

292
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,020
Speaker 6:  you're right Neil, we have not successfully actually seen this thing work

293
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,370
Speaker 6:  yet. Yeah, but I'm, I'm still hopeful. Let me have this, it's good progress.

294
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:27,290
Speaker 4:  Well there's two things. There's one, does this one work and then

295
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:30,780
Speaker 4:  there's the whole point of making the

296
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:34,700
Speaker 4:  discrete GPU with a connector work, which is then you

297
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,330
Speaker 4:  will sell me a new GPU in the future. And

298
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,900
Speaker 4:  that is, I would say an 80% commitment.

299
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,640
Speaker 4:  80, 85. Now it's a vibes commitment,

300
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,620
Speaker 4:  not a we will sell you a GPU that uses this connector and

301
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,540
Speaker 4:  works in this Laptop in

302
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,150
Speaker 5:  The future. I think it's, it's notable that he talks a lot about the area

303
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:57,140
Speaker 5:  51 in in this and that one also promised to

304
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:01,000
Speaker 5:  me and a lot of other folks that was gonna have replaceable GPUs

305
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,820
Speaker 5:  and people actually tried to file a class action lawsuit because

306
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,260
Speaker 5:  the, the GPU never came. They couldn't do it. They've all settled out of

307
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:12,240
Speaker 5:  court in arbitration. But like it's a hard project and, and if

308
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,640
Speaker 5:  the companies of AMD Nvidia OEMs have zero

309
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,180
Speaker 5:  desire to do it, it's not gonna happen. And right now they

310
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,580
Speaker 5:  have some, some desire. Yeah, a little bit, a little bit of its

311
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,300
Speaker 6:  Design. Well and and part of the reason that like Framework is because it

312
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,930
Speaker 6:  is, it's a place those companies can put that desire, if that makes sense.

313
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,900
Speaker 6:  Like it is, it is the one company actually sort of pushing on this so

314
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,600
Speaker 6:  that if you want to do this and you are an executive at AMD or

315
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,560
Speaker 6:  Nvidia or one of these companies, you actually have a partner with which

316
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,140
Speaker 6:  to spin up a project on some of this stuff. And so much of this kind of stuff

317
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,130
Speaker 6:  that we've seen, this just makes me think of like, you know, the project

318
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,780
Speaker 6:  Aura at, at,

319
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,700
Speaker 4:  I knew, I knew we were coming back to

320
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,610
Speaker 6:  Project Ara, my favorite gadget of all time. I will die on the hill of Project

321
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,690
Speaker 6:  Aura. And I. Guess I'm already dead cuz it died a long time ago. But anyway,

322
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:56,980
Speaker 6:  it's

323
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,100
Speaker 5:  Very

324
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,900
Speaker 6:  Dead. It was like these things have just sort of been one off

325
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,860
Speaker 6:  Skunk works in there. And I think just the fact that Framework exists and

326
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,570
Speaker 6:  is selling real products to real people puts that further along.

327
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,610
Speaker 6:  It's not gonna work forever.

328
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:14,300
Speaker 5:  Dell was doing it. Alienware was doing it and there was all these other

329
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,660
Speaker 5:  smaller OEMs who were trying to promise the same thing. This was like

330
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,410
Speaker 5:  2019 was the last time we saw this And I think it's no mistake that like

331
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:25,040
Speaker 5:  heavily involved in this project is amd is Frank Azer who was

332
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,620
Speaker 5:  at Dell at the time right? And was spearheading that for

333
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,380
Speaker 5:  Alienware. And it's a hard, like the, the cooling is a hard pro

334
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,260
Speaker 5:  problem that he gets into here. And it's one that they are always pretty

335
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,020
Speaker 5:  reluctant to overcome because these GPUs are just getting hotter and they're

336
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:43,650
Speaker 5:  getting bigger and, and who like nobody wants to be like, okay,

337
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:47,380
Speaker 5:  well we made a run as good as last year's, but it can go in your replaceable

338
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,060
Speaker 5:  Laptop. Like that's a bad buy for people. So how do they get, like they have

339
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,970
Speaker 5:  to think from the ground up about that heat situation. And

340
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:58,850
Speaker 5:  that I think is gonna be really tricky to get Nvidia and Am MD to do,

341
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,720
Speaker 5:  even with Frank Asher's involvement in this project.

342
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,060
Speaker 4:  And I. I also think there's just a good utility for Framework to exist for

343
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,960
Speaker 4:  almost all these companies because right to repair laws are not going away.

344
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,080
Speaker 4:  Yep. They are bipartisan, they're showing up. People want them.

345
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,940
Speaker 4:  Europe continues to exist somewhat befuddling, they seem to

346
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,570
Speaker 4:  want things all the time. I, I don't know, I dunno what's going on over there.

347
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,560
Speaker 5:  They got feelings about laws

348
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,100
Speaker 4:  And here's this company that has made the most right to repair product. And

349
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,900
Speaker 4:  so I think there's, there's a value in Framework continuing to

350
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,580
Speaker 4:  iterate and like pushing the industry forward even if the products aren't

351
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,560
Speaker 4:  successful or whatever. Because at some point the demand

352
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,980
Speaker 4:  for everyone else to figure it out is going to be there. I

353
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,490
Speaker 5:  Mean, if it gets successful, that's, that's the win, right?

354
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:45,210
Speaker 5:  Like if this thing gets any market share beyond

355
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:49,020
Speaker 5:  like two people buying it, Shawn and myself, that that's,

356
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,660
Speaker 5:  that's a win because that means, oh, there's actual appetite and everybody

357
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,300
Speaker 5:  else is gonna be like, oh, maybe I sh everybody besides Apple, apple will

358
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,700
Speaker 5:  never ever do this. Just, just Apple

359
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,010
Speaker 4:  Won't admit that GPUs exist. Yeah.

360
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:01,300
Speaker 5:  It's,

361
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,110
Speaker 4:  They're like, no, no,

362
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:02,790
Speaker 5:  Never hap

363
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,860
Speaker 4:  You'd be quiet now.

364
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,780
Speaker 5:  But like I could see a Lenovo or an HP being like, yeah, let's,

365
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,600
Speaker 4:  Let's, so let's talk. So, well two things. One, in order for you and Sean

366
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,580
Speaker 4:  to buy the Laptop, they need more than zero functional GPU U

367
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,300
Speaker 5:  In the United States.

368
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,080
Speaker 4:  So that's a big, that's step one. Like guess a time. How do we sell two?

369
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,940
Speaker 4:  We need two like business 1 0 1 2. Let's talk

370
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,780
Speaker 4:  about the flip side of it, which is Monica's Laptop piece this week comparing

371
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,680
Speaker 4:  the HP Spectre x 360 to the, the Dell

372
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,490
Speaker 4:  XPS 13. This is the other side of Laptop world,

373
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:39,090
Speaker 4:  like tiny, highly integrated jewel like Windows

374
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:39,980
Speaker 4:  laptops. These

375
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,240
Speaker 6:  Are the MacBook Air competitors are, these are the MacBook Air competitors,

376
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,740
Speaker 6:  the, the pe the the random people in your life who say, what computers should

377
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:49,640
Speaker 6:  I buy? It's these two and the MacBook Air are like the three go-to answers

378
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,440
Speaker 6:  in the world that exist.

379
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,100
Speaker 5:  Ooh,

380
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,500
Speaker 4:  I will say that she was like, she did a versus article and gave them both

381
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,100
Speaker 4:  an eight. It's a good talk about it. There's your engagement

382
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,860
Speaker 4:  be I would just looking at this,

383
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,740
Speaker 4:  I I would lean Spectre. I, I think HP is on a track here that's

384
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,540
Speaker 4:  really fascinating and the screen is 3.2. Yeah,

385
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,460
Speaker 5:  I like that. HP is always willing to like do

386
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:16,060
Speaker 5:  weird stuff in their Laptop designs. They have been for a while

387
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,960
Speaker 5:  now. Remember when they did like wooden laptops, like they had wooden

388
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,880
Speaker 5:  Palm rests. Yes. I love it. I like get quirky. It's

389
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,020
Speaker 5:  fun.

390
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:27,960
Speaker 6:  No disagree. Get quirky over there and then just

391
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,560
Speaker 6:  make a Laptop. That is good because the Windows world is

392
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,270
Speaker 6:  like severely short on laptops that are just good. But

393
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:38,540
Speaker 6:  Nili, while we're talking about this HP Laptop, can I read you a sentence?

394
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:42,270
Speaker 6:  Yes. Here is the whole sentence. I average just over four hours

395
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:46,220
Speaker 6:  from continuous use of this OLED device. Four hours.

396
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,610
Speaker 4:  That's just Windows Laptop world man.

397
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,140
Speaker 6:  That is honestly, I, I believe to my bones that that is an

398
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,960
Speaker 6:  unacceptable amount of battery life in the year 2023. Like that's

399
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,670
Speaker 6:  so, so, so bad. And this to me is like where

400
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:03,580
Speaker 6:  Apple has just absolutely lapped everybody. Like the the

401
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:07,540
Speaker 6:  Spectre in particular that moniker viewed is, is beautiful. The

402
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:11,020
Speaker 6:  screen is great. The speakers seem to be good. The video chat stuff is fine.

403
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,000
Speaker 6:  It has some nifty features. Four hours is not enough. Four hours

404
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,920
Speaker 6:  is like I take out my computer when the wifi

405
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,820
Speaker 6:  starts on my flight from DC to San Francisco and it's dead before I get to

406
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,530
Speaker 6:  San Francisco. And that doesn't work. Yeah. That's just not,

407
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:30,140
Speaker 6:  it's, it's a deal breaker for me. And that kills me that that is still the

408
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,440
Speaker 6:  thing that holds back so many of these Windows computers.

409
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,380
Speaker 5:  How much of it can be designed out of, right, like, like Apple. The

410
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,740
Speaker 5:  reason the Apple battery life is so good is because Apple controls every

411
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,380
Speaker 5:  single element of it, including the processor so they can have it all work

412
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,340
Speaker 5:  together really, really well. Everybody else is using to some extent off

413
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,140
Speaker 5:  the shelf parts. Like they have to work with Intel or am amd to

414
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,850
Speaker 5:  get those processors that work really, really well and then have all the

415
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:58,780
Speaker 5:  like and windows and whatever the battery manufacturer is. Like that's a

416
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,760
Speaker 5:  lot more complex. This is not me supporting vertical integration, but it

417
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,500
Speaker 5:  has resulted in a lovely Laptop like

418
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,200
Speaker 4:  What if Microsoft made its own laptops, would they get better Battery life?

419
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Speaker 5:  Is the surface battery life good?

420
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,680
Speaker 4:  The surface Laptop Yeah. Has different chips.

421
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,880
Speaker 5:  That's right. They do.

422
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,680
Speaker 4:  So these are, these are, it's older, but I, I think Monica

423
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,320
Speaker 4:  got like 11 hours from like a rise ship. Okay. In a surface

424
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,260
Speaker 4:  Laptop the last time. Ooh. But that's, it's, it's rough. Yeah. Right.

425
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,370
Speaker 4:  It's like it's better

426
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:28,920
Speaker 5:  Than the

427
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,900
Speaker 4:  HP. It's like saying your Honda Civic, it gets better gas mileage than your

428
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,720
Speaker 4:  p Like, it, it's, it's just like hard to compare. It's, but you're right,

429
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,240
Speaker 4:  the problem is the same, right? Yeah. The things are not engineered together.

430
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,130
Speaker 4:  And, I, it's tough even for Microsoft, but it, it, it is more fully

431
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,210
Speaker 4:  down to AMD and Intel than it is to

432
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,810
Speaker 4:  Windows. Yeah. And I think this is, and that's my read of it.

433
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:53,540
Speaker 6:  This is where you can lay most of the blame at Intel's feet. Like in a, in

434
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:57,200
Speaker 6:  a super real way, right? It's like it is possible for these other devices

435
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,860
Speaker 6:  to get good battery life and run windows, but they come with all these

436
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,840
Speaker 6:  other sacrifices like you're talking about such that Intel has spent

437
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,310
Speaker 6:  so long making sure it is like the Windows thing, like

438
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:11,920
Speaker 6:  everything good about Windows is is made with Intel in mind

439
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,570
Speaker 6:  and Intel just can't hack it battery lifewise

440
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:19,520
Speaker 6:  anymore. It just can't. And it just needs to get its crap together.

441
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:19,860
Speaker 6:  And it

442
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,780
Speaker 5:  Even switched its philosophy on how it designs these things. And

443
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,260
Speaker 5:  it's still so far Ha far

444
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,840
Speaker 4:  Behind. Oh man, okay. I just looked it up. Okay,

445
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,060
Speaker 5:  How

446
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:31,860
Speaker 4:  About that Surface Laptop fourth an AMD chip. Okay, that was 10 hours and

447
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,650
Speaker 4:  52 minutes. The new one that Monica just reviewed

448
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:39,240
Speaker 4:  with an Intel chip. Seven hours and 51 minutes.

449
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,220
Speaker 5:  We can't be going backwards guys. No. Like I have to give up

450
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,870
Speaker 5:  my headphone jack. I have to give things up in the name of progress.

451
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:50,580
Speaker 5:  Where is my progress that I'm gaining in losing battery life? This

452
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,980
Speaker 4:  Is what I'm, when I say the Windows versus Mac debate, it's like it's just

453
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:57,770
Speaker 4:  fallen off the list. Like you can walk into the Windows Users

454
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,700
Speaker 4:  club with your Mac Laptop and they're like, we know your battery life. Shut

455
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,490
Speaker 4:  up. We have, we have GPUs. I get 10 minutes

456
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,200
Speaker 4:  from the Nvidia gpu.

457
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,620
Speaker 6:  The frustrating part is like, I actually think you can have a really interesting

458
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:12,480
Speaker 6:  like Windows versus Mac os debate. Like Richard Lawler

459
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,340
Speaker 6:  on our team will occasionally just show up in Slack and drop 650 consecutive

460
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,640
Speaker 6:  messages about how annoying he finds Mac Os because it doesn't

461
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,160
Speaker 6:  do anything. You have to like download apps if you wanna move windows around.

462
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,250
Speaker 6:  And he's right about that. Like Windows is a much

463
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:26,770
Speaker 4:  More

464
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:30,720
Speaker 6:  Capable in certain ways operating system than Mac

465
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,260
Speaker 6:  os is. You can have that debate, but like Apple just makes better laptops

466
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:38,250
Speaker 6:  and it's not close. Like it's it's probably still true that a like

467
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:42,140
Speaker 6:  hack and to MacBook Air is the best Windows Laptop at the moment. It is

468
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:42,580
Speaker 6:  harder to do

469
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,570
Speaker 4:  That now. It's harder to do that. And you still have crap battery life.

470
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:48,860
Speaker 6:  Yeah, but it's so do my Windows computer,

471
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,020
Speaker 4:  Whatever. I'm just taking, I'm taking a spectra. I'm buying an anchor USB

472
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,860
Speaker 4:  battery. That's my look at these laptops. They're beautiful. You have not

473
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,460
Speaker 4:  checked on the state of Windows laptops and you, you, you think

474
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,340
Speaker 4:  they're still where they were? I just go look at Monica's

475
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,900
Speaker 4:  comparison to these two laptops. Look, they are beautiful. Like Apple should

476
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,790
Speaker 4:  boost some ideas from these hardware designs

477
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:12,720
Speaker 4:  where Apple just has the opportunity is like the chips make

478
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,580
Speaker 4:  the MacBook carrier is just a, a wi wisp of a thing now. But

479
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,380
Speaker 4:  these computers are absolutely beautiful and yeah,

480
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,780
Speaker 6:  This Spectra has these like gold accents and this like soft touch thing.

481
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,000
Speaker 6:  Go. It's lovely. It's beautiful. Very end of this computer

482
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,760
Speaker 4:  And for the 20 minutes you can use it if we have to plug it into your

483
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,650
Speaker 4:  10,000 mil

484
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:32,500
Speaker 5:  Battery. Should we talk about speaking of impractical? Yes. Have you

485
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,060
Speaker 5:  have you, you've, you've looked at it, the, the

486
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,660
Speaker 5:  Tesla

487
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,180
Speaker 6:  Speaking of him.

488
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,040
Speaker 4:  That's good. That was a good segue.

489
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,300
Speaker 6:  That's very good. You've

490
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,670
Speaker 5:  Looked at the window, the windshield

491
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:46,600
Speaker 4:  Wiper. I would like to be congratulated. Yeah. For not starting the show.

492
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,940
Speaker 4:  And I ending the show. So proud of you only on the show talking about this

493
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,800
Speaker 4:  wiper. I guess I did start with the wiper did. All right.

494
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,920
Speaker 5:  You just alluded to it.

495
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,250
Speaker 4:  So Tesla had earnings this week. Okay. They announced a bunch of stuff Tesla

496
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:01,060
Speaker 4:  revenue way up cuz they keeps slashing prices. Their margins are coming

497
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,340
Speaker 4:  down. Elon said they would license full self-driving each other automaker

498
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,020
Speaker 4:  and apparently there's an automaker interested. He talked about the charging

499
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,740
Speaker 4:  network and how that's gonna be a source of revenue. So Tesla, you know,

500
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,700
Speaker 4:  in a moment of change, I I would just say right, lower

501
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,420
Speaker 4:  prices, higher revenue, lower margins. Interesting place for Tesla to

502
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:22,300
Speaker 4:  be opening up the software stack. Fascinating. They said they're

503
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,780
Speaker 4:  doing release candidates at the Cybertruck from their factory. You see them

504
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:29,730
Speaker 4:  rolling around Texas. It's very funny, but I

505
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:33,700
Speaker 4:  just, you guys, we'll put it in the show notes. You go

506
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,530
Speaker 4:  look on our site, there's a picture of the Cybertruck

507
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:41,210
Speaker 4:  off-roading covered in mud with its big silly

508
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:45,070
Speaker 4:  wiper trying to wipe the mud off the windshield and the wiper

509
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,340
Speaker 4:  sucks. This is an Official Tesla press

510
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,300
Speaker 4:  photo. This isn't me concocting some sort

511
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:56,140
Speaker 4:  of fake biased mud trial because I hate Elon Musk. I'm looking

512
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,510
Speaker 4:  at the photo the company sent us of it's

513
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:03,350
Speaker 4:  wiper, supposedly wiping and it fucking

514
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,340
Speaker 4:  sucks.

515
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,900
Speaker 6:  I mean it honestly, a, it doesn't wipe

516
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,120
Speaker 6:  completely

517
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:10,880
Speaker 4:  And b

518
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,590
Speaker 6:  It only even attempts to wipe like

519
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,560
Speaker 6:  60% of the, you know this like

520
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,620
Speaker 4:  If you are in the passenger side of this truck, you're not

521
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,250
Speaker 4:  seeing anything.

522
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:25,060
Speaker 6:  Have you ever done the thing when it's cold and you have like snow

523
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,180
Speaker 6:  on your windshield so you like pull your sleeve over your hand and you just,

524
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,740
Speaker 6:  you do this sort of one big wipe just to get some of the snow off. Do you

525
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,020
Speaker 6:  know what I'm talking about? Yes. Yeah, that's what this windshield wiper

526
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,320
Speaker 6:  does. It's just your dumb jacketed

527
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,100
Speaker 6:  arm just going, that's your

528
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:41,470
Speaker 6:  windshield

529
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,980
Speaker 4:  Wiper. I mean. It's just like, I can't believe they release this like at

530
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,900
Speaker 4:  least Photoshop it ask mid journey to be like insert clean

531
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,890
Speaker 4:  windshield

532
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:50,180
Speaker 5:  That

533
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,620
Speaker 4:  They don't you need to do. But this photo is Ho. It's just objectively

534
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:57,140
Speaker 4:  hilarious how bad the wiper is in Tesla's own

535
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:01,060
Speaker 4:  photo. I I cannot believe we all just let it slide this. We are

536
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:05,040
Speaker 4:  recording a day after this photo came out. And I. I'm just,

537
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,980
Speaker 4:  I'm flabbergasted that we as a society, this is why Elon

538
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:12,410
Speaker 4:  bought Twitter. So we couldn't all just cloning on this photo.

539
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:16,220
Speaker 4:  Like look, just look at it. I beg you. Is it gonna look at this

540
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,020
Speaker 4:  photo? This is our, the country's finest engineering minds. And they're like,

541
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:23,700
Speaker 4:  I dunno, this wiper fine. It's, it's nuts. Everything else about the Cybertruck

542
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,700
Speaker 4:  kind of interesting right? They made it, it's much smaller. The packaging

543
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,680
Speaker 4:  is much smaller. So it has a six and a half foot bed in a

544
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,580
Speaker 4:  sub 19 foot frame. A regular pickup miah pickup truck is

545
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,890
Speaker 4:  longer than 19 feet. It has a five foot, five foot.

546
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:40,660
Speaker 5:  This one. So this one is because it can park in normal garages.

547
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,300
Speaker 4:  Yes it can fit in a normal garage. Do you have

548
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,480
Speaker 5:  A special garage?

549
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,440
Speaker 4:  No. I, to get the rafter in my garage, you get two inches on a side.

550
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,220
Speaker 4:  It is horrifying but I'm really good at it now. And now I think I can drive

551
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:55,180
Speaker 4:  that car anywhere. And. I. I should not, that's not, that's not

552
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,500
Speaker 4:  the, that's not accurate. But trucks are getting much longer. Yeah. So this

553
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,460
Speaker 4:  one has a longer bed and a shorter package. It's super interesting packaging

554
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,460
Speaker 4:  innovation from Tesla. They're getting better at manufacturing it, which

555
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,020
Speaker 4:  is a very complicated thing to manufacture. They, I'm just saying they have

556
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,620
Speaker 4:  not in any way figured out how to wipe the

557
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:14,460
Speaker 4:  windshield. Just, I just not, they haven't

558
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,080
Speaker 4:  solved it.

559
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,650
Speaker 5:  Why is it hard to do

560
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,420
Speaker 4:  Wipe the windshield? I

561
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,650
Speaker 5:  I my car. It's not does it quite easily?

562
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:25,520
Speaker 6:  Yeah, we've solved this problem. We have such good windshield wiper technology

563
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,480
Speaker 6:  now that Tesla is choosing not to use.

564
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,020
Speaker 5:  Why? What is the rationale there besides like we don't look

565
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,940
Speaker 4:  Past it. Windshield is at such an extreme angle and it's so large. Okay

566
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,860
Speaker 6:  Because big wiper. Why have good wiper when you can have big

567
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:40,840
Speaker 4:  Wiper? It's true. So el again, we've covered this extensively. Elon has said

568
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,540
Speaker 4:  the wiper like gives him the most like anxiety about the

569
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:48,300
Speaker 4:  Cybertruck cuz I think mounting sta standard wipers on that

570
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,940
Speaker 4:  angle for that size, like it does, I think it would be less

571
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,480
Speaker 4:  effective than the one big wiper.

572
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,740
Speaker 5:  How likely is this thing as soon as you get it on the road behind like a

573
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,940
Speaker 5:  gravel truck to just be the most useless windshield of

574
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,340
Speaker 4:  The world? Well, based on the evidence I have from the companies on marketing

575
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,130
Speaker 4:  materials,

576
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,460
Speaker 5:  It's just wrecked.

577
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,940
Speaker 4:  I just, just look at the picture. It's incredible. Everything. Like, I'm

578
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,900
Speaker 4:  curious about this car. I like trucks. I think it would be fun

579
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,580
Speaker 4:  to go really fast in a triangle.

580
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,540
Speaker 5:  I wanna see this into it on a ranch. I wanna see

581
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,820
Speaker 5:  this driving through, like dealing with cattle, feeding the

582
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,260
Speaker 5:  cattle big shiny metal thing that'll burn at the

583
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,640
Speaker 5:  touch. Just like,

584
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,700
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah, how's it gonna say called who knows more

585
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,840
Speaker 5:  Questions and answer starting grass fires with the reflection.

586
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,220
Speaker 4:  So it's not supposed to ship until late next year really, but they have started

587
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,820
Speaker 4:  production. So that's like the big news. And then the other news that I think

588
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:41,780
Speaker 4:  is just surrounding Tesla that's worth talking about is the flood of

589
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:45,690
Speaker 4:  companies that are adopting the N A C S charging standard, which is the Tesla

590
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:49,500
Speaker 4:  plug abandoning ccs, which is the other garbage plug.

591
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,900
Speaker 4:  Quite frankly, it's an unusual case of the right

592
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,120
Speaker 4:  standard winning and turning into a standard

593
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,900
Speaker 4:  versus whatever ba like the proprietary thing is gonna become the

594
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,660
Speaker 4:  standard good on Tesla for making that happen. The mechanics of it I think

595
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,260
Speaker 4:  are still really unclear. Like these companies are signing deals to use this

596
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:10,090
Speaker 4:  connector. It's not just US standard, yet unclear how that will

597
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:13,940
Speaker 4:  work. The Society of Automotive Engineers, they say they're gonna

598
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,500
Speaker 4:  make it a standard. You can See how Tesla is sort of being

599
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,420
Speaker 4:  incentivized by government subsidies to enable people to use it in

600
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,150
Speaker 4:  order to get tax rebates on, on charging network and other things.

601
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:27,940
Speaker 5:  Tesla hit a point where they say they start charging astronomical

602
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,780
Speaker 5:  fees for you to use this charging standard and companies are

603
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:35,500
Speaker 5:  forced to pay those fees otherwise they can't have their cars

604
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,360
Speaker 5:  charged

605
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,620
Speaker 4:  Across. Like, can, can Elon do a rug pull on an ecs? Yeah, I don't think

606
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:43,560
Speaker 4:  so. I I I'm reasonably certain that

607
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:47,440
Speaker 4:  he can't fool every major car manufacturer. Like maybe

608
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,180
Speaker 4:  one, like maybe if like Nissan was like we did it, we'd be like, eh, eh,

609
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:54,740
Speaker 4:  you picked Chimo the last time. Like, you know like, like I don't know like

610
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:57,350
Speaker 4:  yeah you're bad at this, but they, he's got four gm,

611
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:00,880
Speaker 4:  Volvo, vw like just down the line. He's got them

612
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,060
Speaker 4:  all and more signing every day. So you, you get the feeling at least in the

613
00:32:04,243 --> 00:32:07,380
Speaker 4:  United States, they're gonna end up here and the thing will actually become

614
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,900
Speaker 4:  a standard electrify. America's gonna use it. And what we're just ending

615
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,900
Speaker 4:  up with right now is like this weird interstitial

616
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,670
Speaker 4:  period where it's dongle town for cars,

617
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,920
Speaker 4:  which is not great driving

618
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,160
Speaker 5:  The

619
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,740
Speaker 6:  Dongle town. It was great. Andy Hawkins wrote a story about this and, and

620
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,740
Speaker 6:  had a quote from somebody who said, I feel like I'm driving a beta Max. Yeah.

621
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,160
Speaker 6:  Which is just a really delightful because

622
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,930
Speaker 5:  You are

623
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:31,660
Speaker 6:  Neli correct me if I'm understanding this wrong, but this seems like the

624
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,100
Speaker 6:  kind of thing where the best case

625
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,980
Speaker 6:  scenario everybody wins, which is that

626
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:41,900
Speaker 6:  basically we get a charging network that everybody needs

627
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,780
Speaker 6:  including Tesla, that Tesla doesn't have to build for itself, that works

628
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,370
Speaker 6:  for everybody, thus makes people worry less about range anxiety,

629
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:52,940
Speaker 6:  thus makes more people buy EVs, thus is good for the government and Tesla

630
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,820
Speaker 6:  and all these other companies like who loses in this. It seems

631
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,800
Speaker 6:  like the, the part that's sketchy is that a company invented

632
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,140
Speaker 6:  the thing that is becoming the standard and that that company is Tesla, which

633
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,070
Speaker 6:  is sort of run by a man who is not famously predictable but like

634
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:11,680
Speaker 6:  everything else about this seems like it's heading in a good direction, right?

635
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,820
Speaker 6:  Am I missing something? I

636
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:16,160
Speaker 4:  Think that's right. I think maybe the, the people who are the most upset

637
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,940
Speaker 4:  are Tesla's shareholders who think that Tesla should be a

638
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:23,420
Speaker 4:  monopoly. Sure. Right? But even Elon Musk doesn't apparently think Tesla

639
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:27,140
Speaker 4:  should be a monopoly. But for a minute, if you want an electric car, the

640
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,940
Speaker 4:  only viable choice was a Tesla even today. And there are really

641
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,860
Speaker 4:  good EVs out there right now. Even today, if you wanna travel a

642
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:38,660
Speaker 4:  lot in your EV, you need to buy a Tesla cuz they have the

643
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:42,350
Speaker 4:  infrastructure to support that kind of EV travel. Now you

644
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:45,260
Speaker 4:  don't right? Because they're just gonna open up the charging network and

645
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:49,080
Speaker 4:  their big moat that made their car the best car is gone

646
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,580
Speaker 4:  or loosening. You can still argue that they have the best software experience

647
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,740
Speaker 4:  and the best full self driving, but that's just car stuff now. Before it

648
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,380
Speaker 4:  was like, you buy this car and there are not enough gas

649
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:03,300
Speaker 4:  stations for you and that's gone right? With, with these deals. So I I

650
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,160
Speaker 4:  I think Tesla's just in a more competitive environment,

651
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,620
Speaker 6:  It would be like Apple supporting rcs. It's like literally, you know, giving

652
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:11,060
Speaker 6:  up one of your biggest pieces of lock-in willingly,

653
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,570
Speaker 4:  Right? And I. I I really do think that Tesla had to do it because of

654
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:18,540
Speaker 4:  various basically Biden administration policies that that made them do it

655
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:22,260
Speaker 4:  to get the tax credits in various ways. I think they had to do it because

656
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,110
Speaker 4:  if they didn't then Ford and GM and whoever else

657
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:29,500
Speaker 4:  would actually invest in Electrify America would actually make that

658
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,090
Speaker 4:  network possible because they, they need it to compete. And I, think

659
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:36,780
Speaker 4:  Ford Jim Farley has been on decoder and said, we know the charging experience

660
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,700
Speaker 4:  sucks. They have this massive investment in Mustang Lockey and F-150

661
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,500
Speaker 4:  lightnings and all these other EVs that aren't moving the way they were moving

662
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Speaker 4:  last year with all the tax credits because of the partially cuz of the charging

663
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,470
Speaker 4:  network problems. So I I you just see like, okay, do I want to

664
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:54,050
Speaker 4:  face off against all the world's biggest automakers who will band together

665
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,110
Speaker 4:  and pick the bad standard? Or do I want to try to make some money off the

666
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:01,010
Speaker 4:  supercharging network that I've spent tons and tons of money building

667
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:04,790
Speaker 4:  and I'll maybe I'll charge higher rates to afford customer like the they

668
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,550
Speaker 4:  can play these games. The problem is gonna be, and this is really in Andy's

669
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:11,030
Speaker 4:  piece, the software that makes all this work seamlessly for

670
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:14,790
Speaker 4:  people is gonna be nuts. Yeah. Right? Like if you

671
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:17,670
Speaker 4:  roll up to a supercharger, which doesn't have a screen and you wanna pay

672
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:20,790
Speaker 4:  for it and you need one app, a Tesla app to pay for it, and you roll up to

673
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:24,510
Speaker 4:  Electrify America or charge net or whatever, and you need another app and

674
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:27,070
Speaker 4:  all those different billing systems and your car's sort of incompatible with

675
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:30,870
Speaker 4:  every like, ugh, sorry. I think there's, there's a layer of software compatibility

676
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:34,110
Speaker 4:  that needs to happen here that, I dunno, it does feel like I have a Jeep

677
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:37,660
Speaker 4:  with an old, the old, the now the old connector, the CCS connector. I'm like,

678
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:40,690
Speaker 4:  crap, I bought Thero wrong charging station for my garage. I got this dumb

679
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:44,660
Speaker 4:  beta Max car. It's, this feels like a bad time to buy an EV in

680
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:48,480
Speaker 4:  a way that is the opposite of the intended result, right? Like you

681
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,970
Speaker 4:  buy a new Kia and you're like, welcome to Dongle town. Like that sucks.

682
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:52,500
Speaker 1:  This is like

683
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,450
Speaker 6:  That. Do you remember when everybody was buying combo vcr, DVD players?

684
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:59,420
Speaker 6:  Yeah. This is like, this is that moment and then eventually we'll get to

685
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:03,380
Speaker 4:  Somewhere. We had a good comment on Andy's piece actually, I can't remember

686
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:06,820
Speaker 4:  who it was, but somebody was complaining about dongles and the response,

687
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,740
Speaker 4:  what I thought was really smart was, this isn't like a phone. Cars are really

688
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:13,500
Speaker 4:  big. You can put the adapters almost anywhere. That's

689
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,420
Speaker 4:  fair. They're like, we have trunks and front trunks and glove boxes. Like

690
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,380
Speaker 4:  you'll be fine. And that's probably correct. That

691
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,160
Speaker 6:  Is fair. True.

692
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,100
Speaker 4:  All right, we gotta take a break, man. We been out gadgets. We gotta take

693
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,380
Speaker 4:  a break. We'll come back, we'll do maybe a little more gadgets, then we'll

694
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,500
Speaker 4:  talk about Hollywood. We'll be right

695
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:34,020
Speaker 4:  back.

696
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:43,310
Speaker 4:  Today's show comes from the podcast, business Wars. Business Wars brings

697
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:47,220
Speaker 4:  you drama filled feuds from some of the world's best known companies.

698
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,950
Speaker 4:  Like on New Year's Day 1960 Cardenas Cuba, when

699
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:54,830
Speaker 4:  soldiers seized the Havana Club Rum distillery, or in

700
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:58,630
Speaker 4:  the 1980s when two hippies in Burlington, Vermont had to fight to save

701
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:01,570
Speaker 4:  their business before all their ice cream dreams melted away.

702
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:05,110
Speaker 1:  Warren 2010. When a series of deadly tragedies to factory in

703
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:08,470
Speaker 1:  Bangladesh drew global attention to the fast fashion

704
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:12,150
Speaker 1:  industry, what lengths would they go to in order to keep up with customer

705
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:15,740
Speaker 1:  demand from Wondery? It's not another crime podcast,

706
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:19,710
Speaker 1:  it's Business Wars hosted by David Brown. Business Wars is

714
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,380
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back. Welcome back to Wiper Talk. Do you have a favorite

715
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,330
Speaker 4:  brand of wipers?

716
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:55,000
Speaker 5:  I've, again, I'm sorry. I think those detailers will will have one

717
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,980
Speaker 4:  By the way. Car detail, TikTok, one of my favorite toss. Oh yeah. Could

718
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,100
Speaker 4:  watch it all day long. The

719
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,180
Speaker 6:  The people who just like take the little brush to paint the stripe and just

720
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,050
Speaker 6:  do it freehand all the way down the ugh. Yeah,

721
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:06,960
Speaker 5:  It's beautiful.

722
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,630
Speaker 4:  And then you're like, don't do that to the car. Why? Why do you have this

723
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:14,160
Speaker 4:  still? Yeah. Was that why? Why did the market create the need for this product?

724
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:14,630
Speaker 4:  Little

725
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,440
Speaker 5:  Loopy.

726
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,780
Speaker 4:  All right, let's talk about Hollywood. But I think the way to talk about

727
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,440
Speaker 4:  Hollywood is to start by talking to ai.

728
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,550
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah, that works.

729
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:26,260
Speaker 4:  Right? There's some AI news I think that will lead us into the interlocking

730
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:30,140
Speaker 4:  strikes that have Yes. Brought Hollywood to its knees, which are in

731
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:33,740
Speaker 4:  their core about ai. But there's a bunch of actual AI news this

732
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:37,700
Speaker 4:  week. So first Germin reported at Bloomberg that

733
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:41,620
Speaker 4:  Apple has an AI chatbot. They haven't quite figured out what to

734
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,340
Speaker 4:  do with it, which is funny all on its own. I

735
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,100
Speaker 5:  Love why they made it though. They made it because they didn't want their

736
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:51,040
Speaker 5:  employees using like Bard or ChatGPT for security reasons.

737
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,660
Speaker 5:  And so they're like, okay, well we'll just make our own now we did it. What

738
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:54,900
Speaker 5:  do we do

739
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,470
Speaker 4:  With it? And then here's the fascinating part. They're running it on Google

740
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:01,340
Speaker 4:  Cloud. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Which is just wild. It makes sense. Like

741
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:05,240
Speaker 4:  Apple has a bunch of products that could use an L l M, the new keyboard

742
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,940
Speaker 4:  in IO 17 where it has a language model sort of built into it for better

743
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,700
Speaker 4:  autocorrect. By the way, have you seen this conspiracy theory, I dunno what

744
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:16,660
Speaker 4:  you wanna call it, this claim that the key autocorrect in the current iOS

745
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,900
Speaker 4:  keyboard is very bad. Is And

746
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,920
Speaker 6:  Getting worse. Yes.

747
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,820
Speaker 4:  And getting worse. Yes. Taylor Lorenz made a Instagram video and

748
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:26,010
Speaker 4:  it like tagged me in. It was like, figure this out. And I was like, it seems

749
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:29,800
Speaker 4:  fine for me. I don't know how to, it's just a vibe.

750
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,180
Speaker 5:  It is. I can't tell you how many times somebody says, I'm sorry, what did

751
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,280
Speaker 5:  you say? And then I have to go look back and be like, that's not what I typed.

752
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,500
Speaker 4:  You think it's getting worse? I

753
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,320
Speaker 5:  It's, it feels like it's getting worse. I'm dying.

754
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,700
Speaker 4:  So maybe my fingers are DM an email. Leave us a comment if you think it's

755
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,620
Speaker 4:  getting worse. This is a very difficult thing to measure. Yeah. I

756
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:49,180
Speaker 4:  have not noticed it, but it seems like Alex has. David, what about you?

757
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,970
Speaker 6:  I definitely have not noticed it getting worse. It seems, it seems

758
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:53,720
Speaker 6:  fine to me.

759
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,140
Speaker 4:  Here's my theory, it's the summer and everyone's drinking.

760
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,550
Speaker 5:  I was, I was about to say this hap this happened to be on the path train

761
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,150
Speaker 5:  today where I was so

762
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:04,190
Speaker 4:  Where everyone's hammered.

763
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:08,000
Speaker 5:  There were some hammered people, but I was sober and it still did it.

764
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,900
Speaker 5:  But it does also happen. Seems to happen more when Yeah. You're having a

765
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,560
Speaker 5:  good time.

766
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,540
Speaker 4:  I'm just saying like you, you soak that iPhone in Rose keyboard doesn't work

767
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:20,380
Speaker 4:  so well just woo. Conspiracy. But I'm dying. you know, people

768
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:24,180
Speaker 4:  have seen it cuz I've seen this around. Yeah. Like I said, Taylor tagged

769
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,900
Speaker 4:  me in a video she made. I've seen other videos about it, but I, it's, it's

770
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,840
Speaker 4:  like impossible to measure. So we just need a lot of like anecdote.

771
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,620
Speaker 6:  My, my running hypothesis is that this is kind of along the

772
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:38,520
Speaker 6:  lines of the, my phone is listening to me conspiracy theory

773
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,120
Speaker 6:  in that like, you see 700,000

774
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,500
Speaker 6:  ads a day and the one that happens to have been

775
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:49,120
Speaker 6:  perfectly targeted is the only one you pay attention to. Which ironically

776
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,960
Speaker 6:  is a statement about how good targeted ads actually are,

777
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,360
Speaker 6:  but is also the thing that makes people think they're listening. It's like,

778
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,180
Speaker 6:  no it's just, it, it's, it's a one in 700,000 chance and you just

779
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,060
Speaker 6:  only notice the one that got it. Right. This strikes me as sort of the same

780
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:06,140
Speaker 6:  thing where like people type a lot into their phones and these things make

781
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:09,100
Speaker 6:  mistakes and some of them are weird. The ones that always get me are the

782
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,840
Speaker 6:  people who type a word and it pops up the little autocorrect bubble

783
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,700
Speaker 6:  trying to auto correct it to something insane. Yeah. I have not noticed that

784
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,920
Speaker 6:  again on my phone. But there are lots of people who say that it has,

785
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,630
Speaker 5:  It changed. What are you doing to water

786
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:27,550
Speaker 5:  doing? I'm like, that's just no one talks like that

787
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,120
Speaker 5:  Apple

788
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,290
Speaker 4:  People from Pennsylvania,

789
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:30,580
Speaker 6:  I've

790
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:34,300
Speaker 5:  Not from there. Just

791
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,530
Speaker 5:  assumed.

792
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:38,260
Speaker 4:  Alright, we started by talking about AI and we ended up with this keyword

793
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:41,420
Speaker 4:  thing. Let me know. Let us know. Yeah. We're dying to know. Yes. We, I'd

794
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:44,920
Speaker 4:  love to run this story to ground in the only way we can do it. There's responses.

795
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,250
Speaker 4:  So Apple's building this thing called Ajax are running and Google cloud,

796
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:51,140
Speaker 4:  they are doing LMS in the keyboard. You can See how they would wanna plug

797
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:55,080
Speaker 4:  this thing into Siri. It is wild to me that

798
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:59,020
Speaker 4:  Amazon hasn't plugged an LLM into Alexa and Google hasn't plugged

799
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:02,930
Speaker 4:  one into assistant Siri. No one's gonna be like, oh no, you changed

800
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:06,900
Speaker 4:  Siri like five. Like let's

801
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,840
Speaker 4:  Siri try to come onto you a little bit.

802
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,140
Speaker 5:  One person is, I don't know who you are, but you're out there and you're

803
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,260
Speaker 5:  gonna be really upset and I'm so

804
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:16,660
Speaker 4:  Sorry. It's, it's amazing to me that at this moment in time Microsoft has

805
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,960
Speaker 4:  horny or products than Apple.

806
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,700
Speaker 5:  No, that doesn't shock me at all. Microsoft always

807
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:25,000
Speaker 5:  much more low key horny than Apple. No. Since the beginning.

808
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,500
Speaker 4:  No. Now we gotta, no I disagree. I don't know how, I don't know how to further

809
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:28,900
Speaker 4:  this conversation.

810
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,420
Speaker 5:  This is our inaugural debate. I don't for a future

811
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,090
Speaker 5:  podcast,

812
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:36,450
Speaker 4:  I've never wanted to not have a conversation but

813
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:40,180
Speaker 4:  also viscerally disagree with you as much as I do right

814
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:40,620
Speaker 4:  now

815
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,620
Speaker 5:  I win. You can't argue

816
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,880
Speaker 4:  I win. I don't, I dunno how to say that's just wrong.

817
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,780
Speaker 5:  Please don't debate me in the Vercast emails with this one either, folks.

818
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,120
Speaker 5:  I don't, I don't need it.

819
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:55,020
Speaker 4:  That's fine. All I'm saying is it's weird that Bing is like let's do it.

820
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:55,460
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I

821
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:58,160
Speaker 6:  Agree with that.

822
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:58,540
Speaker 4:  The thing

823
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:02,090
Speaker 6:  That's not weird, you said it's weird that these things haven't been integrated

824
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:05,940
Speaker 6:  into like Alexa and assistant in Siri yet they're bad. Like it's really

825
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:09,900
Speaker 6:  important to remember that like Chad g p t is bad. It's

826
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,900
Speaker 6:  like, it's fascinating and it's interesting and there's so many things you

827
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,500
Speaker 6:  can do with it that are very cool. It's wrong a lot and And I think

828
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,340
Speaker 6:  like Siri sucks but it's not prone to lying to

829
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:24,180
Speaker 6:  you. And, I think all this stuff that we're reckoning

830
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:28,090
Speaker 6:  with with like what does it mean that ChatGPT exists? Like what if I asked

831
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:31,780
Speaker 6:  Siri to turn off Bluetooth and the large language model like told me Bluetooth

832
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:35,440
Speaker 6:  doesn't exist and like invented a conspiracy theory about Bluetooth

833
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,980
Speaker 6:  and how's h Bluetooth is what my phone is using to listen to me. Wait,

834
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:42,940
Speaker 4:  I just wanna point out that might be a better situation than

835
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:44,810
Speaker 4:  whatever happens with Siri now

836
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:47,370
Speaker 6:  When it says here's some web results for Bluetooth.

837
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:51,340
Speaker 4:  Yeah, exactly. That's not helpful. Like fine spin me a yard about the

838
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:54,770
Speaker 4:  pirate named Bluetooth. Like I don't, at least it's interesting.

839
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:57,890
Speaker 6:  Yeah. But I think this is my, this is why I like this Apple story because

840
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:01,860
Speaker 6:  like if you follow the timeline here, this is what Apple does, right?

841
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:05,020
Speaker 6:  They let everybody make the products and then Apple comes in and says, we're

842
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:08,970
Speaker 6:  the ones who made this good. I think what is very clearly

843
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:12,700
Speaker 6:  true is that you cannot yet solve all of the problems of these large language

844
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,740
Speaker 6:  models. We just haven't figured out how to do it. And there's no

845
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:19,330
Speaker 6:  indication really ever that Apple has some like

846
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:23,220
Speaker 6:  generations ahead AI thing going on. If anything, apple has been behind on

847
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:27,180
Speaker 6:  this stuff for a decade and so I think Apple is probably in here

848
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:30,980
Speaker 6:  being like, we can build a better ChatGPT. And then they just built a ChatGPT

849
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:34,760
Speaker 6:  and they're like, well shit, now what do we do with this?

850
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,620
Speaker 6:  And they're, if, if they can figure out how to make that a

851
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:41,580
Speaker 6:  product people actually want to use that lives up to like Apple's standards

852
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,580
Speaker 6:  and that they can tell a privacy story about, that'll be cool and exciting.

853
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:47,180
Speaker 6:  I don't see that happening anytime soon.

854
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:50,720
Speaker 4:  I mean honestly at this point with Siri, Siri's response to every query was,

855
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,290
Speaker 4:  let me spin you a yarn about the pirate.

856
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:53,600
Speaker 6:  It's like hilarious lie. Yeah,

857
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,980
Speaker 5:  I'd like way better.

858
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:58,820
Speaker 4:  I maybe that's fine. Do it. you know the Amazon side of it and the Google

859
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:01,620
Speaker 4:  side of it that makes sense to me why they haven't integrated it. Right?

860
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:05,460
Speaker 4:  That's boring business stuff. Like Alexa is not a business.

861
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:09,090
Speaker 4:  They haven't figured out how to make it a business. It's been years.

862
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:12,760
Speaker 4:  They cut some of the Alexa team earlier this year cuz there's

863
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:16,660
Speaker 4:  no path to some huge profitable business. All these queries cost

864
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:20,010
Speaker 4:  money. So you're like, we're gonna make it more expensive to run Alexa

865
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:23,990
Speaker 4:  against No business is not a good decision.

866
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:24,340
Speaker 4:  Right?

867
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:27,970
Speaker 6:  So where you see Amazon investing is like, how do we use

868
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:31,900
Speaker 6:  LLMs on amazon.com right? Yeah. Which is, that's the business that

869
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,630
Speaker 6:  actually will make Amazon money in the long run.

870
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:37,520
Speaker 4:  Right? Can we make, can we make the descriptions of items on Amazon better

871
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,660
Speaker 4:  and richer and more fun to read that will sell more things. Google has the

872
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:44,260
Speaker 4:  same problem, right? Like Google Assistant for all of it's crowing about

873
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:47,620
Speaker 4:  how it's the future over the past years. Like Google Assistant is not a

874
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:51,460
Speaker 4:  business. It it, it's useful. I like, I am the only person that

875
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:55,300
Speaker 4:  likes Google Home and it's because the displays have the cool photo

876
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,980
Speaker 4:  feature where they are reflective. That's it. That's why we are a Google

877
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,130
Speaker 4:  family. so

878
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:02,360
Speaker 5:  Like nothing to do with the Google assistant?

879
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,980
Speaker 4:  No, very little to Google assistant. It's the, I think the hardware is

880
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:09,540
Speaker 4:  superior hardware. Oh yeah. To the Amazon hardware because of the, the photo

881
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:13,340
Speaker 4:  reflectivity feature. And I. Think Google Photos is superior backend for

882
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:16,780
Speaker 4:  photos and the Amazon thing and fine and Google Assistant exists. You may

883
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:20,740
Speaker 4:  set timers from E Google given you've passed the first two

884
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:23,860
Speaker 4:  doors. you know, like would it, would it be cool if Google Assistant was

885
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:27,300
Speaker 4:  more conversational and like more useful than that? Sure. But then they have

886
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,450
Speaker 4:  to run an ln query, which costs infinitely more money

887
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:34,300
Speaker 4:  than whatever steam engine Google Assistant is

888
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,880
Speaker 4:  running on now. you know? And is slower

889
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,760
Speaker 6:  And more error prone and harder to guess what it's gonna

890
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,280
Speaker 6:  do and harder to sort of manually program like these things are

891
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:48,220
Speaker 6:  bigger and weirder and wackier, And, I think that's gonna make them be

892
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:50,010
Speaker 6:  much slower for a lot of this stuff.

893
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:53,700
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And I think, especially now as people are getting more used to

894
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:57,660
Speaker 4:  what LMS can do and can't do. You're just seeing like, oh these

895
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:01,560
Speaker 4:  things are like, as you said, David, they're mostly a c plus. Yeah.

896
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,580
Speaker 4:  And like in

897
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,610
Speaker 5:  Some cases they're getting dumber.

898
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:07,420
Speaker 4:  Yeah. What is that study this week that ChatGPT is getting dumber at math,

899
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:07,820
Speaker 4:  right? Yeah.

900
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:11,100
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's getting worse at maths. That's amazing. That's that's great. Cuz

901
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,640
Speaker 5:  we are all bad at math

902
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,560
Speaker 6:  And it's learning from us.

903
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,610
Speaker 4:  Stupid computer

904
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:22,590
Speaker 5:  That'll learn you like why were we ever scared Where're the where

905
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:25,370
Speaker 5:  we're the, the source material? Of course it's gonna be fine.

906
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:28,700
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean, and then there's the idea of model collapse. Did you see this

907
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:32,540
Speaker 4:  week Wix announced Wix is a website host. Yeah. They

908
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:35,960
Speaker 4:  announced you could create an entire website and deploy it with just a couple

909
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,540
Speaker 4:  of like chatbot

910
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:41,060
Speaker 5:  Prompts. But they were also very clear, like, don't just use the copy

911
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:44,300
Speaker 5:  rewrite. It's, it's written by like ChatGPT I think, oh I've

912
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,060
Speaker 4:  Got, and they're like, I've got bad news for Wix. People are just gonna use

913
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,980
Speaker 4:  the copier. Oh yes. And then there's a turn in there that is really fascinating

914
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:54,820
Speaker 4:  to me. So the their demo. The Wix demo was for like an

915
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:58,620
Speaker 4:  online fitness company or something. so like training company, like something

916
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:02,260
Speaker 4:  with classes. Yeah. so like they, like I have a company that

917
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:06,100
Speaker 4:  does trainings, make me a website and then it's like, it

918
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:09,740
Speaker 4:  showed picture of like instructors and it was like, pick an instructor that

919
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:12,700
Speaker 4:  matches your vibe. And they obviously picked like the coolest one and then

920
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,570
Speaker 4:  it made a whole website. And then the next turn was, we are

921
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:20,210
Speaker 4:  also managing the scheduling of your classes. We see you have some

922
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:23,340
Speaker 4:  open slots. Do you want us to make a social media

923
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:27,180
Speaker 4:  marketing campaign? Whoa. To get customers for you? And

924
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,900
Speaker 4:  you're like, yes. And it just fired off some Instagram assets or

925
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,100
Speaker 4:  whatever and it published them and said, it's done using the existing and

926
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:38,000
Speaker 4:  it's like at some point and you're not even running the business. Yeah.

927
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,700
Speaker 4:  And then I saw someone else tweeted at me just pointing out a

928
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,500
Speaker 4:  startup guy who's like, I just published

929
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:48,220
Speaker 4:  250,000 words of content to like 45

930
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:51,740
Speaker 4:  niche interest websites that I started. They're all just at SEO honeypots

931
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:55,700
Speaker 4:  and I'm making money. And it's like, oh the, the cannon of c plus

932
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:59,680
Speaker 4:  content is here. Yep. Yeah. At scale. Like massive scale.

933
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,580
Speaker 4:  And that's, I, you know, you know how I feel about the web Come, come

934
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:07,480
Speaker 4:  with me to my private web of people. The robot

935
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:11,440
Speaker 4:  web continues to grow. So this is actually the next piece of

936
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,180
Speaker 4:  AI news. Meta is giving away it's AI stack, it's

937
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:18,980
Speaker 4:  called Llama and it's called Llama two. They're running it on Azure. It's

938
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:22,540
Speaker 4:  a Microsoft service. So Microsoft's kind of the overall winner, right? Big

939
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:26,260
Speaker 4:  investment in OpenAI. OpenAI is using Azure. Now this partnership with

940
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:30,120
Speaker 4:  Meta, Microsoft is a big investor in Meta from like way back now.

941
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:34,020
Speaker 4:  Meta's Stack is gonna run on Azure. So Microsoft's just like, just run

942
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:37,540
Speaker 4:  it here, just optimize for our chips and our services and our data

943
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:40,560
Speaker 4:  centers and we're the winner. Like everyone's just gonna pay us the fees.

944
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,780
Speaker 4:  The fascinating thing about Metas announcement is they keep claiming that

945
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:47,660
Speaker 4:  they've open sourced their model, which is fascinating because

946
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:51,460
Speaker 4:  it already leaked, if you'll recall. So Meta's l LM leaked,

947
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:54,820
Speaker 4:  people were using it, they, you know, running on laptops. So it's not a great

948
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:58,640
Speaker 4:  outcome for a variety of reasons, mostly about safety. But that led

949
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,340
Speaker 4:  to a memo inside of Google that said, we have no moat. These open source

950
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:06,260
Speaker 4:  models will kill us. Big controversy there. So now Matt's saying,

951
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:09,620
Speaker 4:  okay fine, we're just gonna open source the whole thing. But then they didn't

952
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:13,460
Speaker 4:  actually open source it. They didn't. So the license is not actually an open

953
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,860
Speaker 4:  source license. It's not an Official open source license. It doesn't meet

954
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:18,760
Speaker 4:  the definition. What is it? It has all these restrictions in it. And if you

955
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:22,190
Speaker 4:  are a big company with over 700 million active

956
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:26,020
Speaker 4:  users, you don't get to use it at all. Yes. So it's just like not

957
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:26,720
Speaker 4:  open source

958
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,920
Speaker 6:  Is that, that's literally just Google and Apple

959
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,460
Speaker 4:  And Snap I think is the smallest of the companies.

960
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:35,580
Speaker 6:  Interesting. Hit the threshold. And, I. Guess like Telegram now. Sure. Sorry.

961
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:36,200
Speaker 6:  Telegram.

962
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,860
Speaker 4:  And they're like, if the our competitors wish to use it, they can make a

963
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:41,300
Speaker 4:  deal with us. And it's like, guys, that's not open source.

964
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:44,820
Speaker 5:  I love that. I open source asterisk.

965
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:47,340
Speaker 4:  I mean they keep saying it's open source. It's like you read the license,

966
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,100
Speaker 4:  it's like not an open source license. Well

967
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,500
Speaker 6:  It's just asterisk. Like when, when Elon Musk keeps saying he's gonna open

968
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:55,180
Speaker 6:  source the, the Twitter algorithm and it's like posting some of the

969
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:57,610
Speaker 6:  code is not the same as Opensourcing.

970
00:51:57,610 --> 00:52:01,320
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's like, you know who the most pedantic nerds of all are

971
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:05,100
Speaker 4:  are open source nerds. Yeah. Like you say it's open

972
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:08,780
Speaker 4:  source and you like, here's our model. And it's like what community do you

973
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:10,860
Speaker 4:  think that you are interacting with right now?

974
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:14,150
Speaker 5:  I would honestly rather have like an open source

975
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:17,900
Speaker 5:  aficionado read a contract I need to sign before a contract lawyer. Yeah.

976
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:21,060
Speaker 5:  Like they will go through every single, they'll find

977
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:23,140
Speaker 5:  everything. Every, I don't

978
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,580
Speaker 4:  Have to worry about it. Like I'm renting this car. Is it open source? Anyway,

979
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:30,340
Speaker 4:  it's just we, we've asked Meta about it. I'm very curious what the reasoning

980
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:33,340
Speaker 4:  here. It's like why they're using this term. It is going to land them in

981
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:36,500
Speaker 4:  some amount of trouble with like the open source community. But they keep

982
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,580
Speaker 4:  saying it. And I think the reason they're saying it is cuz they want to be

983
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:43,380
Speaker 4:  perceived as a provider of models people have a dependency on. But if you're

984
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:46,420
Speaker 4:  gonna do, if you're gonna open source, you have to actually do it. You have

985
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:48,980
Speaker 4:  to actually give the source code to people and let them use it however they

986
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:52,370
Speaker 4:  want basically. And that is like, here are a bunch of rules and restrictions.

987
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:55,740
Speaker 4:  Like the words open source and acceptable use

988
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:59,580
Speaker 4:  policy are not aligned. Like those are

989
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,780
Speaker 4:  not concepts that plug into each other. This is

990
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:05,500
Speaker 6:  Much more in along with like the creative commons where it was like the,

991
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,140
Speaker 6:  like on flicker a million years ago. Right. They would, they would be the

992
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:11,840
Speaker 6:  license that it was like, you can use this photo only for your personal

993
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:15,340
Speaker 6:  use and yeah, you have to give credits to the original author. And that's

994
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:18,820
Speaker 6:  kind of a foundational thing on the internet. That's not open source. Open

995
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:22,180
Speaker 6:  source means you can have it and do what you want with it,

996
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:23,370
Speaker 6:  generally speaking.

997
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:26,360
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Open source licenses are copyright licenses. Yeah. They're like rooted

998
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:29,220
Speaker 4:  in the fact that you own the copyright and you're like offering terms of

999
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:32,770
Speaker 4:  a license, but they're very rarely

1000
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:36,500
Speaker 4:  like conditional in the way that this is conditional. And yeah, now

1001
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:40,110
Speaker 4:  we're 40 years into the open source experiment. There are

1002
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:43,900
Speaker 4:  governance bodies that are like, these are the licenses that

1003
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:47,520
Speaker 4:  count and these are the ones that don't. And Meta didn't pick one that does,

1004
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,980
Speaker 4:  you know, and like is this biggest deal in the world? It's not the biggest

1005
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,980
Speaker 4:  deal in the world. Can I tell The Vergecast audience about open source licenses?

1006
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:56,850
Speaker 4:  I can And I. I think Meta should be like, we should stop using this word

1007
00:53:56,850 --> 00:54:00,300
Speaker 4:  because it just doesn't mean the thing that it's supposed to mean. And it's

1008
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,100
Speaker 4:  like to me, important they're

1009
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:05,290
Speaker 5:  Going to keep doing it until they get in trouble.

1010
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:09,190
Speaker 4:  Well that's why I mean that's the sheriff of open source is here. Yep. I

1011
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:13,100
Speaker 4:  dunno if you know my fourth title here at Fox Media, they call me the

1012
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:16,140
Speaker 4:  sheriff. Well, but I'm saying that community before we noticed it. Yeah.

1013
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:20,080
Speaker 4:  That open source community said, what are you doing here? And I. Think it's,

1014
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:24,060
Speaker 4:  it is important for how software is made that those words, me continue

1015
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:27,020
Speaker 4:  to mean the thing they're supposed to mean. All right. I promised we would

1016
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:30,650
Speaker 4:  segue from this AI conversation to the Hollywood AI conversation.

1017
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:32,900
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I'm gonna figure out a way to segue it. Okay.

1018
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:36,740
Speaker 6:  I I can segue this with a question. So I've found myself for whatever reason

1019
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:40,620
Speaker 6:  listening to a lot of podcasts about the strikes happening in

1020
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:44,580
Speaker 6:  Hollywood. And the reason I think we should talk about the strike right now

1021
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:48,420
Speaker 6:  is there's a lot of different things floating around, a lot of

1022
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:51,180
Speaker 6:  different arguments being had. There are two separate strikes happening that

1023
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:54,760
Speaker 6:  are kind of connected and kind of not. And the biggest thing I cannot

1024
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:58,720
Speaker 6:  figure out, And I want you to answer this for me, Cranz is, okay,

1025
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,740
Speaker 6:  how much is this actually about ai? Because what the writers have been saying

1026
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:05,660
Speaker 6:  is we don't want studios to be able to use ChatGPT and other tools to generate

1027
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:09,060
Speaker 6:  scripts. The actors were saying, we don't want you to be able to use our

1028
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:12,980
Speaker 6:  likenesses and like make deep fakes of us to go into movies. And then I

1029
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,280
Speaker 6:  listened to all these like big wigs in the entertainment business saying,

1030
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,430
Speaker 6:  no, that's all sort of a, a far off farce. What they're actually arguing

1031
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:21,730
Speaker 6:  about is streaming residuals. Which one is it? Yeah,

1032
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:25,390
Speaker 5:  Streaming residuals are the, like residuals is the core

1033
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:29,320
Speaker 5:  thing here. Because residuals is how the majority of both actors and writers

1034
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:29,890
Speaker 5:  get paid.

1035
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:33,160
Speaker 6:  Okay. So let's, let's come back to that. But let, yeah, tell me how much

1036
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,200
Speaker 6:  AI actually matters first.

1037
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:39,140
Speaker 5:  AI matters because in both cases they're worried about the potential

1038
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:42,580
Speaker 5:  future use, not the current use to some extent. Okay. To a large

1039
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:45,660
Speaker 5:  extent. And so they're worried about that potential future use and they wanna

1040
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:49,640
Speaker 5:  make sure that the studios don't be assholes further down the line.

1041
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,900
Speaker 5:  So for the writers, they're specifically saying, we want certain

1042
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:56,820
Speaker 5:  protections. You can't give us, you can't have ChatGPT go

1043
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:00,620
Speaker 5:  come up with a script and then make us write it and then not pay us for

1044
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:04,600
Speaker 5:  coming up with the ideas for the script. Like we don't wanna have to

1045
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:08,380
Speaker 5:  be using ChatGPT prompts to write. And so

1046
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:12,240
Speaker 5:  that's like the core thing there is they, they don't want, they want

1047
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,970
Speaker 5:  AI to be treated as a tool, not as like a creative force

1048
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:17,960
Speaker 5:  that can be copyrighted and everything like that.

1049
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:21,490
Speaker 6:  But no one is out here thinking that tomorrow

1050
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:24,960
Speaker 6:  ChatGPT could write a great script that would turn into a blockbuster mark.

1051
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:25,180
Speaker 6:  Oh,

1052
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:27,060
Speaker 4:  Some people, yeah. I don dunno if they're correct

1053
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:27,740
Speaker 5:  I mean the studios

1054
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:28,780
Speaker 6:  Are totally, totally I mean. They're definitely not

1055
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:32,650
Speaker 5:  Correct. Yeah. The studios are very interested in, in AI and they would like,

1056
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:36,460
Speaker 5:  they would love to be able to cut the writers out entirely or just pay

1057
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:40,210
Speaker 5:  writers to edit whatever ChatGPT wrote, which

1058
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:43,320
Speaker 5:  like they would love to do that and they'd love to do that consistently.

1059
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:46,900
Speaker 5:  And the writers are like, you can't do that yet. You will probably be able

1060
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:50,820
Speaker 5:  to do that in a few years and we wanna go ahead and just nip that in the

1061
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:54,250
Speaker 5:  but now. Okay. So that's what's happening with the writers. For the actors.

1062
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:57,860
Speaker 5:  It's specifically right now, if you're an actor you just go get

1063
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:01,700
Speaker 5:  scanned. Like you signed a contract for a new show or something, a

1064
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:04,700
Speaker 5:  new movie, you go and they're gonna like scan your face, they're gonna scan

1065
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:08,380
Speaker 5:  your body and then they just take that data and walk away with

1066
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:12,140
Speaker 5:  it. And right now there's, it's not clear where they take that

1067
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:15,620
Speaker 5:  data and if, you know, hit me up cause I'd love to know, but specifically

1068
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:18,980
Speaker 5:  background actors, they're saying, well, we would love to take a background

1069
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:22,530
Speaker 5:  actor's face and scan it and then never pay them for that initial

1070
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:26,440
Speaker 5:  scan and never pay them again and use their face however

1071
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:30,300
Speaker 5:  we want forever in, in our films and TVs. And

1072
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:34,040
Speaker 5:  so background actors are like a, like that's how you get your card,

1073
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:37,380
Speaker 5:  that's how you kind of get into sag. That's a, for some of them it's not

1074
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:41,180
Speaker 5:  a livelihood, but it's, it keeps the lights on right. Between that and their

1075
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:44,820
Speaker 5:  DoorDash side hustle or whatever. And so they, they, they obviously don't

1076
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:47,420
Speaker 5:  wanna do that. So that's where they're concerned there because most of the

1077
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:51,260
Speaker 5:  big actors like the Matt Damons, the Killian Murphy's Yes. I saw Oppenheimer.

1078
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:52,160
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1079
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,880
Speaker 4:  You see it in 70 Millimeter? No, with the Palm Pilot,

1080
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,560
Speaker 5:  But I saw it with Christopher Nolan and so I think it's okay if we don't

1081
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,970
Speaker 5:  see it at IMAX. I think it's okay. Yeah.

1082
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:05,660
Speaker 6:  Flex. So just to put a point on that, so I was thinking about this

1083
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:08,140
Speaker 6:  because have you guys seen the new Indiana Jones movie? No,

1084
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:10,540
Speaker 5:  Not yet. But they, they age stuff they do in that. Yeah. So

1085
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:14,080
Speaker 6:  For the first like 20 minutes of the movie, I guess this is a spoiler alert,

1086
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:17,940
Speaker 6:  but like whatever, it's in Neogen, he's de aged, like

1087
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,850
Speaker 6:  digitally de aged. And it is, it is

1088
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:22,340
Speaker 4:  Both. How's a spoiler? The best. You think that's a spoiler. Don't email

1089
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:23,180
Speaker 4:  us. Go ahead.

1090
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:26,500
Speaker 6:  If if you think it's a spoiler, you already have commented on The Verge dot

1091
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:30,300
Speaker 6:  com about it, so I understand. But it, it's better than any

1092
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:34,160
Speaker 6:  version of that I've seen before and it's also still pretty bad.

1093
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,960
Speaker 6:  And it also clearly still requires Harrison Ford.

1094
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,900
Speaker 5:  So that one was unique though because they used

1095
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:44,820
Speaker 5:  Lucas film had tons of footage of him. They had all these

1096
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:47,980
Speaker 5:  dailies from all the other projects, all the Star Wars Sure. And Indiana

1097
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:51,900
Speaker 5:  Jones they've used when he was that age. And so they actually used all of

1098
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:54,440
Speaker 5:  that footage to recreate his face.

1099
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:57,380
Speaker 6:  So that's actually maybe closer to the kind of thing you're talking about

1100
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,120
Speaker 6:  than most of what we've seen in the past.

1101
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,660
Speaker 5:  And that one was okay because like should it, it was like the stuff, they

1102
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:06,150
Speaker 5:  weren't using it in other things. And and for someone of his

1103
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:09,380
Speaker 5:  level, like they're gonna go and make a a different deal Like, he Yeah. Presumably

1104
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:11,980
Speaker 5:  he's gonna, he's gonna have like a SAG contract, but he's also gonna have

1105
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:14,850
Speaker 5:  this other contract and, and, and they'll, they'll make those agreements.

1106
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:18,200
Speaker 5:  This is to protect all those people who don't have these other, these other

1107
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:22,180
Speaker 5:  con separate contracts to make sure that they don't get screwed

1108
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:25,780
Speaker 5:  over. So that like you're a background actor, you hit it big and

1109
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:29,140
Speaker 5:  then suddenly you're just popping up all over the place

1110
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:33,060
Speaker 5:  because Right. 20 years ago, somebody got the rights to your face.

1111
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:35,000
Speaker 5:  Okay. That's what they're trying to avoid.

1112
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,450
Speaker 4:  So what's fascinating about that is the

1113
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:42,080
Speaker 4:  writers are sort of operating in the bounds

1114
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:45,580
Speaker 4:  of existing copyright law. Yes. Because they write

1115
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:49,500
Speaker 4:  things. Yeah. And they, you can make copies of it and the

1116
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:53,300
Speaker 4:  law understands all of that. And so the writers are like, we

1117
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:56,330
Speaker 4:  wanna get paid these rates for these kinds of work. Your

1118
00:59:56,330 --> 01:00:00,210
Speaker 4:  face is not a copy of anything.

1119
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:00,620
Speaker 5:  It's just

1120
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:04,540
Speaker 4:  Your face or should not be. And the idea that you can scan it and that

1121
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:07,980
Speaker 4:  becomes a copy of your face and you've made a copy of your face doesn't exist

1122
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:11,710
Speaker 4:  anywhere, but it exists in some state level likeness law.

1123
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:15,660
Speaker 4:  Right. Of publicity law. There's no copyright law for

1124
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:19,210
Speaker 4:  your face. This is just a new problem. And so

1125
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:23,010
Speaker 4:  it's, I think Hollywood is gonna have to invent a solution to this problem

1126
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:26,600
Speaker 4:  that is way ahead Yeah. Of the government of

1127
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:30,480
Speaker 4:  courts or whatever because there's just no answer for, you can't

1128
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,140
Speaker 4:  go and find the answer to this question inside the law. Well, And, I'm not

1129
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:38,060
Speaker 4:  saying the writers don't have complicated problems of their own, but

1130
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:41,880
Speaker 4:  they're at least inside of something that makes sense that there's a Framework

1131
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:45,100
Speaker 4:  for talking about, I'll give you an example. Just this week there was a court

1132
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:48,620
Speaker 4:  case where a bunch of photographers had sued first

1133
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:52,240
Speaker 4:  Buzzfeed and then Instagram because Buzzfeed

1134
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:56,100
Speaker 4:  had embedded Instagrams of their photos. So

1135
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,860
Speaker 4:  that Right. The photographers are taking some photos posted on Instagram.

1136
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:01,780
Speaker 4:  Buzzfeed embedded the Instagram posts onto Buzzfeed

1137
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:05,620
Speaker 4:  articles and the photographer sued Buzzfeed and Instagram said,

1138
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,140
Speaker 4:  this is copyright infringement. Haven't

1139
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:10,020
Speaker 6:  We had this debate before? I'm getting like real dejavu, were listening to

1140
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:10,260
Speaker 6:  you explain

1141
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:13,020
Speaker 4:  This. Yeah. This happens all the time. And so the courts over the years,

1142
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:16,260
Speaker 4:  this is a true thing in our law. No one talks about it. Like we're, if you

1143
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:20,060
Speaker 4:  look at people on the social networks, they're all like, LLMs are fair

1144
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:23,340
Speaker 4:  use training. This like this is where we are. In reality, in

1145
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:26,650
Speaker 4:  2023, the courts applied what is known as the server

1146
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:30,640
Speaker 4:  test and they said no copy of this photo

1147
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:34,100
Speaker 4:  was ever made on buzzfeed. The photo still

1148
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:37,860
Speaker 4:  existed on Instagram servers and the user's web

1149
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:41,580
Speaker 4:  browser called Instagram servers. Thereby the

1150
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:45,400
Speaker 4:  server test, which is now part of United States copyright law

1151
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:48,040
Speaker 4:  is there's no copyright infringement with photographers loose.

1152
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:51,820
Speaker 6:  But if Buzzfeed had screenshotted that Instagram and put it on its

1153
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:53,400
Speaker 6:  site, it might have been a different fight.

1154
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,780
Speaker 5:  And that's why you don't screenshot

1155
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:58,720
Speaker 4:  And to the user, there's no difference in those things. Right, Right. Wild.

1156
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,940
Speaker 4:  And we are, we are at, where is the copy I I'm gonna keep, I'm gonna end

1157
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:05,440
Speaker 4:  up saying this on the show a thousand times during this AI battle copywriter

1158
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:09,420
Speaker 4:  law is about copies the court in deciding whether embedding

1159
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:13,400
Speaker 4:  an Instagram post on a Buzzfeed article is copyright infringement, goes

1160
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:17,140
Speaker 4:  and finds the copy of the photo and it's on Instagram

1161
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:20,900
Speaker 4:  server because that's where the photographer themselves put it in accordance

1162
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:24,140
Speaker 4:  with Instagram's terms of service. And the court said, Nope, Buzzfeed can

1163
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:27,380
Speaker 4:  use it for free because it's on Instagram server. And if they had

1164
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:30,660
Speaker 4:  screenshotted it like David said and put it on a thing, which is to

1165
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:34,650
Speaker 4:  you exactly the same experience and in many cases

1166
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:37,500
Speaker 4:  good journalism practice. Right. Because Instagram could take a photo down.

1167
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:41,420
Speaker 4:  Who knows? Like then they might have lost because the copy of the photo would've

1168
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:45,210
Speaker 4:  been on Buzzfeed servers and that is the game,

1169
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:49,060
Speaker 4:  like where is the copy? Yeah. And so the writers on, on their

1170
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:52,420
Speaker 4:  side, they have copy, they have I mean it's hundreds of years of copyright

1171
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:55,900
Speaker 4:  law about writing things down and making copies of them and putting them

1172
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:59,320
Speaker 4:  here and who owns what's rights. And then you get to faces and you're like,

1173
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:03,220
Speaker 4:  we just don't do this. There's, there's, there's a vacuum of

1174
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:07,020
Speaker 4:  this because you can't do it. There's just never been occasion to care about

1175
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:09,380
Speaker 4:  it before. Right, right. Yeah. You've made a copy of my face, you're like,

1176
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:13,260
Speaker 4:  oh that's a, that's nothing. Yeah. That's what that is. Yeah. Right. Or

1177
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:16,350
Speaker 4:  you've made a movie and like for me to be in your movie, there's some laws

1178
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:20,340
Speaker 4:  about like my life, there's cases about re-edits of movies that you can,

1179
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:24,160
Speaker 4:  like we've covered because they're complicated. But you've never

1180
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,180
Speaker 4:  had the, you took my whole face and now you can use my face as many times

1181
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:28,260
Speaker 4:  as you want. We

1182
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:31,780
Speaker 5:  Have though. We like, we see this sometimes like in Hollywood there is a

1183
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:32,940
Speaker 5:  little bit more law here. And, I'm

1184
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:35,650
Speaker 4:  Yeah. California state law. Yeah. Because of Hollywood exists

1185
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:39,410
Speaker 5:  Because like Sma Lou, the, the actor who was in Shang Chi

1186
01:03:39,410 --> 01:03:42,940
Speaker 5:  last year for Marvel, before he was a big famous actor, he went out and did

1187
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:46,740
Speaker 5:  a whole bunch of photos for pub. Like just

1188
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:50,720
Speaker 5:  yeah, go use them and show shutter soccer, whatever. And so then now

1189
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:54,460
Speaker 5:  you can go find those and be like, put him put this big

1190
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:55,180
Speaker 5:  celebrity

1191
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:56,210
Speaker 4:  Like royalty free.

1192
01:03:56,210 --> 01:03:58,980
Speaker 5:  Yeah. This royalty free big celebrity thing. That was great. And and we've

1193
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:00,780
Speaker 5:  seen this happen a couple of times and then they'll usually be

1194
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:02,980
Speaker 4:  Like, but you can do that. You can't, he can't tell you to take him down

1195
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:05,320
Speaker 4:  cause they're royalty free stock photos of him. Right.

1196
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,370
Speaker 5:  But like but

1197
01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:10,300
Speaker 4:  Even that is a photo that's not his face. Yeah. You haven't

1198
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:14,270
Speaker 4:  made him do something he wasn't doing before because you have a digital

1199
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:18,100
Speaker 4:  model of his face. Yeah. And there's just no, as far

1200
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:21,620
Speaker 4:  as I know, there's not like a great Framework for that. There's some in

1201
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:24,980
Speaker 4:  some, once people have come up out of Hol cloth, like that horrible Will

1202
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:28,660
Speaker 4:  Smith movie that they shot at 120 Hertz. Do you know what I'm talking

1203
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:31,780
Speaker 4:  about? Gemini Man, if you watch it, the intended frame rate, it looks like

1204
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:35,180
Speaker 4:  a CGI demo reel. It doesn't even look like A real movie. Like why'd you do

1205
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:38,580
Speaker 4:  this? It's like an unreal engine commercial. Yeah, yeah. For that

1206
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:42,500
Speaker 4:  movie. He signed a deal where I think he owns that model. He didn't

1207
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:45,180
Speaker 4:  want the studio to have it, but he's Will Smith. He has the leverage to do

1208
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:49,060
Speaker 4:  it. These background actors, they, they're only way to get leverage is

1209
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:50,130
Speaker 4:  by going on strike.

1210
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:53,940
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And so that's what they're doing. They're all on strike and it's

1211
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:57,700
Speaker 5:  gonna last a while. It seems like everybody's really entrenched in

1212
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:01,420
Speaker 5:  their positions. The producers don't wanna give over more money. Cuz this

1213
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:04,580
Speaker 5:  is ultimately, this all boils down to money, right? Yeah. Streaming makes

1214
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:08,380
Speaker 5:  a lot of money. Streaming is we, we like to talk about, oh, which streamer

1215
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:12,210
Speaker 5:  is gonna be go nine on the go nine day scale. But they all make money.

1216
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:16,020
Speaker 5:  They're all doing pretty Okay. Some Netflix way better

1217
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:19,040
Speaker 5:  than everybody else. Right. They're doing, they're doing great.

1218
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:22,660
Speaker 4:  And Netflix, they rolled out the ad tier subscriptions went

1219
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:23,090
Speaker 4:  up.

1220
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:26,780
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And Netflix also was one of the first to figure out how

1221
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:30,600
Speaker 5:  to, I don't wanna say manipulate, but aggressively use

1222
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:33,940
Speaker 5:  the current contracts to cut down on how much they pay

1223
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:37,820
Speaker 5:  people. And that's what they're trying to get rid of. That's what they're

1224
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:41,750
Speaker 5:  trying to fix. Right. And naturally Netflix doesn't

1225
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:44,320
Speaker 5:  wanna help them on that cause they wanna keep all the money for themselves.

1226
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:48,100
Speaker 4:  So Netflix is really interesting. It's time for the disclosure block.

1227
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:50,540
Speaker 4:  We're way late on this. Yeah. I apologize. We're we're minutes late to this

1228
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:54,460
Speaker 4:  series of escalating disclosures. Ooh one, we made

1229
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:57,300
Speaker 4:  a Netflix show. I'm the EP of that Netflix show. It's called The Future of

1230
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:00,030
Speaker 4:  You Should Go Watch It. Two. Our company makes all kinds of other Netflix

1231
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:03,220
Speaker 4:  shows with all the other streamers that division, our company is called Box

1232
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:06,100
Speaker 4:  Media Studios. You should watch everything they make and then send us cash

1233
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:09,800
Speaker 4:  in an envelope. Our newsroom is unionized. The Writers School of America.

1234
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,260
Speaker 5:  I'm in the wga. Yeah,

1235
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:14,680
Speaker 4:  Here she is. It's true. She's she's on strike.

1236
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:18,040
Speaker 5:  I'm not on strike. She's not on strike. I'm not, I'm not on a contract that

1237
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,850
Speaker 5:  is currently on strike. Alex

1238
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:22,050
Speaker 6:  Will not be in the background of your movie.

1239
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:22,670
Speaker 5:  That too

1240
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:24,480
Speaker 6:  Until future notice.

1241
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,970
Speaker 4:  And then NBC is one of these company

1242
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:29,060
Speaker 4:  Universal.

1243
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:32,200
Speaker 5:  N yeah. NBC Universal is currently

1244
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,740
Speaker 4:  Ooh And I own a chunk of Vox media. They

1245
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,260
Speaker 6:  Do. We all watch shows from time to time. This,

1246
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:38,290
Speaker 4:  There's, there's all,

1247
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:41,740
Speaker 5:  They are actually at the heart of a lot of the, the, the strike stuff happening

1248
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:43,460
Speaker 5:  this week. NBC Universal. Really?

1249
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:44,210
Speaker 6:  Yep. Do so.

1250
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:46,940
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So this is, we're getting into TREE LAW now. Oh,

1251
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:48,200
Speaker 4:  Here we go. TREE LAW.

1252
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:51,260
Speaker 6:  All caps. TREE LAW. Just to be clear. Yes. This is not lowercase. This is

1253
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:52,320
Speaker 6:  all caps.

1254
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:56,300
Speaker 5:  NBC Universal is one of the many studios that is currently, they're,

1255
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:59,380
Speaker 5:  they're having strikes outside of them. And so picket lines go out there

1256
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:02,820
Speaker 5:  and they march and it's A real honest to God picket line. Like you see from

1257
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:03,780
Speaker 5:  history. The

1258
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:07,510
Speaker 6:  Signs are incredible by the way, just as a, as a side note, like an incredible

1259
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:10,700
Speaker 6:  genre of the internet right now is writer and

1260
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:14,280
Speaker 6:  actor picket signs. They're just phenomenal.

1261
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:17,260
Speaker 5:  If you ever wanted to go meet an actor, they might be on a picket line right

1262
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:20,060
Speaker 5:  now and you can go meet them, but you should also be picketing and like give

1263
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:23,740
Speaker 5:  them water and stuff. Yeah. But so planned picket lines were to happen outside

1264
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:27,630
Speaker 5:  of NBC Universal. They have a whole bunch of trees which provide lovely

1265
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:31,340
Speaker 5:  shade. Those trees are owned by Los Angeles because

1266
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:35,090
Speaker 5:  they're outside of the studio. Those trees were all mysteriously

1267
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:38,580
Speaker 5:  trimmed just before the picket line was supposed to

1268
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:42,570
Speaker 5:  happen. So there was no shade. And it's like a hundred degrees in

1269
01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:46,380
Speaker 5:  Hollywood right now. And so there was a lot. NBC Universal

1270
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:50,180
Speaker 5:  said it's just standard. We always trim these trees down to the, like

1271
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:50,780
Speaker 5:  the limbs,

1272
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:51,770
Speaker 4:  The hubs.

1273
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:55,120
Speaker 5:  Yeah. This is totally normal. It's fine. It's

1274
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:58,900
Speaker 5:  not. LA is like investigating them because TREE, LAW,

1275
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:02,580
Speaker 5:  TREE LAW, it's, you can't, that's not their trees to go trimming. And it's

1276
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:06,260
Speaker 5:  apparently really bad to trim those trees to that length in the

1277
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:06,680
Speaker 5:  summertime.

1278
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,580
Speaker 4:  That's just cartoon villainy. Serious.

1279
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:09,370
Speaker 6:  Seriously.

1280
01:08:09,370 --> 01:08:13,260
Speaker 4:  Like I was gonna say the thing about Netflix, which all the producers are

1281
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:15,970
Speaker 4:  doing Cartoon villain in some way. Yeah. The true law thing is ridiculous.

1282
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:19,820
Speaker 4:  Woof Netflix got a pass on this contractual obligation stuff, right? Yeah.

1283
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:23,740
Speaker 4:  Because if you think back a year ago or two years ago, Netflix was

1284
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:26,900
Speaker 4:  just writing checks. Nobody could match. Oh yeah. They're like, Shonda Rhimes,

1285
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:30,160
Speaker 4:  here's a billion dollars. Make as many shows as you can. Right. And what

1286
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:33,780
Speaker 4:  has turned is Netflix needed to be profitable. So stopped writing those

1287
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:37,600
Speaker 4:  checks. It burned a lot of those creators by not renewing their shows.

1288
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:41,280
Speaker 4:  It burned a lot of the fandoms of those shows. Yep. By not renewing the shows,

1289
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:44,300
Speaker 4:  it has all this content. No one's making any residuals. And then the most

1290
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:47,700
Speaker 4:  important thing is that all the other companies Chase Netflix into that business

1291
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:51,620
Speaker 4:  model. Yep. So they all felt like they had to compete. They had to

1292
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:55,420
Speaker 4:  outspend Netflix. So for a minute, Netflix is the industry hero cuz they're

1293
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:58,580
Speaker 4:  writing big checks and they have a business model that seems to

1294
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:02,300
Speaker 4:  work and they I mean it does because they're profitable. And then at the

1295
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:05,340
Speaker 4:  other end of the Rainbow is, oh, the whole industry adopted this business

1296
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:09,160
Speaker 4:  model. The, the financial structure of how

1297
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:12,760
Speaker 4:  we get paid is now gone because we were addicted

1298
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:16,660
Speaker 4:  to cable reruns and selling internationally

1299
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:20,380
Speaker 4:  into different markets. And now it's all just on HBO Max or Peacock or

1300
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:22,320
Speaker 4:  Netflix or whatever. Yeah.

1301
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:26,140
Speaker 5:  Cuz these shows are like, if you look at the contract, these shows look appear

1302
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:29,580
Speaker 5:  differently in the contract. They don't appear as linear tv. They don't appear

1303
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:33,460
Speaker 5:  as cable tv. And so in order to hit like that threshold to

1304
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:37,260
Speaker 5:  start paying higher residuals, they have to make more content. And

1305
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:41,140
Speaker 5:  it's usually like, I think after the second season is when things start to

1306
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:44,900
Speaker 5:  go up. Which is why you see so many Netflix shows canceled after the second

1307
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:48,460
Speaker 5:  season because then they, they don't have to pay increased

1308
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:52,380
Speaker 5:  residuals. But Camika Glenn was a actress on Oranges of the

1309
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:55,300
Speaker 5:  New Black. She was a main character on that show. She was in, I think she

1310
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:58,680
Speaker 5:  started in like the second or third season is when she appeared on the show

1311
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:02,510
Speaker 5:  in a ton of it. Main character making maybe if she's

1312
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:05,890
Speaker 5:  lucky 50 cents per

1313
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:09,740
Speaker 5:  episode in residuals when like she's a star of the

1314
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:13,520
Speaker 5:  show. And that's most of that cast, which was all primarily

1315
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:17,060
Speaker 5:  people who weren't normally seen on tv. Yeah. It was a big deal that they

1316
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:20,790
Speaker 5:  all got these roles and they were all having to work second jobs,

1317
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:24,700
Speaker 5:  their jobs to afford it. And it's still are like this did not open the world

1318
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:28,620
Speaker 5:  to them and make them all fabulously ri rich. Maybe other shows did, if

1319
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:31,540
Speaker 5:  they went were lucky and got a network show. But if you're on a streaming

1320
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:35,460
Speaker 5:  show, you're not like, you cannot support yourself. You have

1321
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:39,160
Speaker 5:  to have a second job. Which means you will see an actor you love at Target

1322
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:42,450
Speaker 5:  and you should be really polite to them because they're probably working.

1323
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:43,450
Speaker 5:  Just be chill.

1324
01:10:43,450 --> 01:10:47,340
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It's like Mandy Moore who is like a huge star and was

1325
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:50,980
Speaker 6:  on This Is Us, which was a giant hit, was talking in an interview I think

1326
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:54,600
Speaker 6:  this week about the residuals check that she's been getting from Hulu, which

1327
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:57,620
Speaker 6:  now has, this is Us. And she said there was one check that was one penny.

1328
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:00,700
Speaker 6:  There was one that was 2 cents. There was one that was 81 cents. It's like,

1329
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:04,680
Speaker 6:  this is not it. This is not actual money that these folks are getting.

1330
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:08,410
Speaker 6:  But the thing that I struggle with is, if you rewind

1331
01:11:08,410 --> 01:11:12,140
Speaker 6:  five years, there were a lot of very smart people who were

1332
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:15,300
Speaker 6:  like waving their hands saying this is unsustainable. Netflix is spending

1333
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:18,940
Speaker 6:  money, it doesn't have, it's in crazy debt. We're due for some consolidation.

1334
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:22,500
Speaker 6:  This is all getting outta control. And for years, everybody just like

1335
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:25,860
Speaker 6:  blissfully danced along and a lot of people made a lot of money off of these

1336
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:29,100
Speaker 6:  streaming services. Like Shonda Rhimes made a ton of money and employed a

1337
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:32,880
Speaker 6:  lot of people. And so was, were we

1338
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:36,840
Speaker 6:  just always due for this correction? Yes. Is this is just the pendulum

1339
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,550
Speaker 6:  swinging to the other side before we get to the middle.

1340
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:41,840
Speaker 5:  This is totally cuz the WGA strike back in

1341
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:45,830
Speaker 5:  2007 was about residuals then too for streaming.

1342
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:48,960
Speaker 5:  They saw this was like totally nascent at this point that I think there were

1343
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,800
Speaker 5:  like maybe three web series disclosure. I was actually

1344
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,640
Speaker 5:  writing for one of those at the time. Yes. Good disclosure. It was Lifetime.

1345
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:58,060
Speaker 5:  That's a disclosure.

1346
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:01,440
Speaker 4:  That's so much better than my Joseph and the amazing technic code disclosure.

1347
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,860
Speaker 5:  I, I wrote one episode. What was it called? It was, the show was called Inspector

1348
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:05,660
Speaker 5:  Mom. Oh my

1349
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:06,230
Speaker 4:  God. Incredible.

1350
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:08,613
Speaker 5:  Wait, starring Janet Keller.

1351
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:09,990
Speaker 4:  Danica Kel. Wow.

1352
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:11,580
Speaker 5:  Yeah, she's lovely.

1353
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:13,380
Speaker 4:  Wow. Yeah, it's fancy.

1354
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:17,000
Speaker 5:  But so back in 2007 it was like us and Battle Star

1355
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,780
Speaker 5:  Galactica. And I want you to be be cl very clear. We were

1356
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:24,080
Speaker 5:  in no way in the same level as Battle Star Galactica. One

1357
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,460
Speaker 4:  Of those, one of those was a hit. Yeah.

1358
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:28,320
Speaker 5:  One of those, you know the other one you just learned

1359
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:32,200
Speaker 5:  about. But there was, but there wasn't a lot. But everybody was super interested

1360
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:35,480
Speaker 5:  in it. Yeah. And at the time, everybody was doing it as an ultra low

1361
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:38,640
Speaker 5:  budget. And when you're producing these things as ultra low

1362
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:42,520
Speaker 5:  budget, you don't have to pay as much. You, you can really dick

1363
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:45,880
Speaker 5:  people around and you can pay them a lot less. You can pay your writers less,

1364
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:48,320
Speaker 5:  you can pay your actor's list and everything like that. And they were like,

1365
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:51,600
Speaker 5:  well, this is gonna be a whole new thing. We clearly need to make sure our

1366
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,240
Speaker 5:  writers get paid. And so that's why they went on strike back in

1367
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:58,200
Speaker 5:  2007 to, to make sure that they were gonna get that money. And they

1368
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:01,320
Speaker 5:  were really not as aggressive as they should have been. There was a big argument

1369
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:05,240
Speaker 5:  within the WGA about it at the time. The people who

1370
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:08,040
Speaker 5:  were like, don't worry about it. One, all the other people were like, what

1371
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:11,840
Speaker 5:  did we say for the last 15 years? Yeah. And so now we're at this point, like

1372
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:15,700
Speaker 5:  they've been waiting for a very long time. This was

1373
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:19,360
Speaker 5:  always probably going to happen. And I. Think the biggest surprise is that

1374
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:23,230
Speaker 5:  the dga, the Director's Guild isn't a part of this

1375
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:27,020
Speaker 5:  because so many, I think the reason that didn't happen for them

1376
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:30,430
Speaker 5:  is so many of them are also producers. Much more of them

1377
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:34,240
Speaker 5:  like Standard are producers as well. So they're like, this

1378
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:36,980
Speaker 5:  works for us, we're fine. Yeah, we can, we can make it work.

1379
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:40,880
Speaker 4:  But they're also and directors in a very real way. You

1380
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,750
Speaker 4:  can't copy their work. Yeah.

1381
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:46,660
Speaker 5:  Like, like a lot of those big existential questions that are facing

1382
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:49,720
Speaker 5:  the writers and the actors directors don't have to deal

1383
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:53,120
Speaker 5:  with and, and these other ones are having to face that like writers having

1384
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:56,880
Speaker 5:  to face. Okay, if the producer like goes and

1385
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:00,840
Speaker 5:  writes a prompt and sends me that prompt that like writes a

1386
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:04,400
Speaker 5:  prompt. ChatGPT spits something out, he sends that to

1387
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:08,160
Speaker 5:  me. Who owns the And I Write a whole script. Do I own the

1388
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:11,820
Speaker 5:  copyright to my script? Does ChatGPT own the copyright to the script? Does

1389
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:15,780
Speaker 5:  the guy who like busted out a quick prompt own the copyright to my

1390
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:19,450
Speaker 5:  script and everything in it and all the, the, the intellectual material.

1391
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:22,780
Speaker 5:  Like they gave me 150 words. And I turned that into a two hour

1392
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:26,040
Speaker 5:  movie. Why should the studio get to own that?

1393
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:30,020
Speaker 4:  So again, there's just a long history of concepts. Yeah. That

1394
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:33,180
Speaker 4:  might help you answer that question. I don't know what, where they're gonna

1395
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:37,110
Speaker 4:  land. What I, what I know is the

1396
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:41,020
Speaker 4:  money that they're looking for. The challenge is that

1397
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:44,440
Speaker 4:  either it doesn't exist the way that it used to

1398
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:47,770
Speaker 4:  or it exists, but it's flowing to the

1399
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:51,520
Speaker 4:  CEOs slash it's being used to fund

1400
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:55,220
Speaker 4:  vastly more projects than before. So friends, I think friends is like the

1401
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:58,410
Speaker 4:  example here. All the people who made friends are rich and they're gonna

1402
01:14:58,410 --> 01:15:01,700
Speaker 4:  keep being rich and whatever. They're doing great, they're doing great. Seinfeld,

1403
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:05,180
Speaker 4:  another example, they made friends, they put it on broadcast

1404
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:08,460
Speaker 4:  television. They sold a bunch of ads against that broadcast television. They

1405
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:12,060
Speaker 4:  paid all the actors a million dollars an episode for friends because just

1406
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:15,500
Speaker 4:  that first cut was so valuable with ads on broadcast television. Everybody

1407
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:19,360
Speaker 4:  watched it every Thursday. Then they sold it again

1408
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:22,820
Speaker 4:  to four syn countries and to syndication and the cable networks. Then they

1409
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:26,780
Speaker 4:  sold it at 15th time to Netflix. Then I came off of Netflix and

1410
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:30,540
Speaker 4:  they sold it at 16th time to, what is it, Hulu? Where is it now? Wherever

1411
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:30,900
Speaker 4:  it is now. I

1412
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:31,890
Speaker 6:  Think it's on Peacock now.

1413
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:32,700
Speaker 4:  It's on Peacock.

1414
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:33,340
Speaker 5:  It's on Peacock, yeah.

1415
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:35,770
Speaker 4:  Where they sold it to themselves the last time.

1416
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:38,260
Speaker 6:  Well, and it was a big deal. Do you remember how big a deal that was actually?

1417
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:41,500
Speaker 6:  Because they were leaving a ton of money on the table to bring it back to

1418
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:44,980
Speaker 6:  Peacock as a big bet on what Peacock was like. Do that, that thing held its

1419
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:46,430
Speaker 6:  value for so long.

1420
01:15:46,430 --> 01:15:49,740
Speaker 4:  Right? Because it's a, it's an asset. Like it's a very, I don't know, you

1421
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:52,980
Speaker 4:  make a widget and you can sell it however many times. The Stream model is,

1422
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:56,640
Speaker 4:  you make a show and you sell it once.

1423
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:00,180
Speaker 4:  Yep. Probably to yourself. And then you hope it brings in

1424
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:03,870
Speaker 4:  subscribers and you, you kinda end up in this horrible Spotify situation

1425
01:16:03,870 --> 01:16:07,220
Speaker 4:  where you're like, okay, you pay me $9 a month. You what? You play this much

1426
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:10,620
Speaker 4:  Taylor Swift. We're gonna divide up the total number of streams. And Taylor

1427
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:13,460
Speaker 4:  Swift gets a penny, but she gets a billion streams. So it's a billion. And

1428
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:17,160
Speaker 4:  like the contractor they're negotiating now has to contend with that math

1429
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:21,060
Speaker 4:  versus the, we made you a show and you have sold it for

1430
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:24,860
Speaker 4:  dollars over and over and over again. Now it's, we made you a

1431
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:27,740
Speaker 4:  show and you're gonna sell it for pennies once.

1432
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:31,380
Speaker 5:  Well see we're seeing a big change there. Like David Z. Love, love to rip

1433
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:35,140
Speaker 5:  on the guy. Cartoonish fell in in many ways, but, but he is big on

1434
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:38,220
Speaker 5:  like, show doesn't work for us or whatever. We can go and sell it again.

1435
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:42,060
Speaker 5:  We saw that with Westworld. And, I think we're gonna see more of that. Especially

1436
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:45,340
Speaker 5:  some of it is we need to unload these assets that just aren't doing it for

1437
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:49,220
Speaker 5:  us. Maybe they'll do better on Peacock because nobody

1438
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:51,350
Speaker 5:  subscribes to Peacock except for me.

1439
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:54,780
Speaker 4:  Maybe do Better on Peacock. That's gonna save the industry. That's a, that's

1440
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:56,320
Speaker 4:  a sign, that's a strike sign right there.

1441
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,460
Speaker 5:  But, but they, they are thinking about like we, we like, they're starting

1442
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:03,400
Speaker 5:  to think about how we need to sell these things and, and make more money

1443
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:06,880
Speaker 5:  off of it. The studios are thinking that. Not just the, the writers and actors

1444
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:10,300
Speaker 5:  and producers and everybody who are making no money in

1445
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:14,100
Speaker 5:  per perpetuity on these projects. So I think we

1446
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:17,700
Speaker 5:  are gonna see some changes there. I think we're gonna see kind of a

1447
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:21,580
Speaker 5:  return to some extent of that current like that TV model from 10,

1448
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:25,240
Speaker 5:  15 years ago. And I don't think it's gonna be as lucrative as it was then.

1449
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:25,820
Speaker 5:  And it's

1450
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:28,380
Speaker 6:  Gonna be 2003. Again, this is just what we're doing here. And I. Think

1451
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:31,200
Speaker 5:  We're gonna see. I think what we're really gonna find out is how powerful

1452
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:35,160
Speaker 5:  the Netflix voting block and the Producers union is.

1453
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:38,730
Speaker 5:  Or the producers Guild. That's the real thing. Cuz Netflix

1454
01:17:38,730 --> 01:17:41,700
Speaker 5:  doesn't wanna ever move to that model. They wanna have everything owned by

1455
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:45,500
Speaker 5:  them and then never pay you residuals. A lot of these other studios have

1456
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:49,460
Speaker 5:  been doing this a lot longer and they're gonna be more inclined

1457
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:52,780
Speaker 5:  to go in a different direction. So we're gonna see, I'm really

1458
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:55,260
Speaker 5:  curious to See how this ends.

1459
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:57,590
Speaker 4:  I think it's gonna be a long time. I think we're in for,

1460
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:58,530
Speaker 5:  We're in for mid months

1461
01:17:58,530 --> 01:18:02,060
Speaker 4:  Into, into winter. Yep. Basically. All right. We gotta take a break. We come

1462
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:05,890
Speaker 4:  back. We're gonna do lightning round. Maybe some more gadgets. Yeah, I talk

1463
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:08,140
Speaker 4:  some CMS. People have asked before. We'll be right

1464
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:13,910
Speaker 4:  back.

1465
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:27,790
Speaker 4:  We're back. Lightning around time. We went way over. We're already over.

1466
01:19:27,790 --> 01:19:28,290
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah.

1467
01:19:28,290 --> 01:19:32,030
Speaker 5:  You get me talking about unions in Hollywood. Whew. That's you in

1468
01:19:32,030 --> 01:19:32,570
Speaker 5:  copyright.

1469
01:19:32,570 --> 01:19:34,710
Speaker 4:  That's and it's all at the same time. Oh my

1470
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:35,820
Speaker 5:  God. Poor David. Sorry.

1471
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:38,750
Speaker 4:  David's just been holding up a stopwatch in the background. Like red cards,

1472
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:42,610
Speaker 4:  like Stop, stop Nerds, please. Nerd.

1473
01:19:42,610 --> 01:19:46,190
Speaker 4:  Car going off Cliff. All right. Lightning round. David, you wanna

1474
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:46,860
Speaker 4:  start?

1475
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:50,470
Speaker 6:  Sure. So, well, I have two. One is just that

1476
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:53,660
Speaker 6:  Andrew Marino, And I figured out why there's a Palm Pilot in your favorite

1477
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:56,910
Speaker 6:  IMAX theater and you should go read our story. Very good. The answer turns

1478
01:19:56,910 --> 01:20:00,030
Speaker 6:  out to be like very small and slightly boring, but also deeply hilarious

1479
01:20:00,030 --> 01:20:01,170
Speaker 6:  and it makes me very happy.

1480
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:04,150
Speaker 4:  Can I just say, the sourcing of that story is incredible cuz you keep referring

1481
01:20:04,150 --> 01:20:07,460
Speaker 4:  to a well-placed sort and it's like, I'm not, I'm not gonna reveal who it

1482
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:11,140
Speaker 4:  is. It just, it makes it sound like you're reporting on the CIA in the best

1483
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:13,420
Speaker 4:  possible way. I

1484
01:20:13,420 --> 01:20:17,380
Speaker 6:  Think the, the truth of the matter is there aren't that many people who

1485
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:21,153
Speaker 6:  know. Let's just say that it's my source is Christopher Nolan.

1486
01:20:21,190 --> 01:20:25,060
Speaker 6:  Let's just, just, let's just do it now. No, I wanna talk just very

1487
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:28,760
Speaker 6:  briefly about this new thing called the US Cyber Trust Mark, which

1488
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:32,180
Speaker 6:  is basically a label that is going to be affixed to

1489
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:35,970
Speaker 6:  products that are, I don't know, safe in a

1490
01:20:35,970 --> 01:20:39,700
Speaker 6:  cybersecurity way. And I. Both want to know what you guys think of the

1491
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:43,460
Speaker 6:  logo, which I have deeply mixed feelings about. To me it looks like a, like

1492
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:47,300
Speaker 6:  second tier Turkish soccer team. Crest. That's the

1493
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:50,970
Speaker 6:  vibe I get here. But it's like a shield with some

1494
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:52,480
Speaker 6:  dots and some lines

1495
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,330
Speaker 5:  Too busy.

1496
01:20:53,330 --> 01:20:57,180
Speaker 6:  It's just not great. And this is supposed to connote like the, this is an

1497
01:20:57,180 --> 01:20:59,730
Speaker 6:  Official government approved

1498
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:00,310
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1499
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:04,280
Speaker 6:  Cyber secure thing. To me, this strikes me as a good idea

1500
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:07,820
Speaker 6:  in theory, right? Like having a thing that is like this is a secure device

1501
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:11,450
Speaker 6:  that has passed some measure of testing and will not do sketchy things. Great

1502
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:15,100
Speaker 6:  idea. It's along the lines of the like, you know, privacy, nutrition

1503
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:18,750
Speaker 6:  labels. Apple does in the app store. Big fan. I don't see any

1504
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:22,540
Speaker 6:  world in which this is enforceable or holds up

1505
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:26,260
Speaker 6:  over time. Threats change devices change standards

1506
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:30,010
Speaker 6:  change things go outta date. There's always some new hack. And the idea

1507
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:33,610
Speaker 6:  that one of the things they wanna do is put a QR code on the box so you can

1508
01:21:33,610 --> 01:21:37,540
Speaker 6:  scan the QR code to see if it's up to date and still safe. So

1509
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:40,380
Speaker 6:  actually the badge doesn't mean anything. You have to scan the QR code to

1510
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:43,260
Speaker 6:  see if the badge still applies. I just think this is one of those like good

1511
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:45,760
Speaker 6:  ideas that nobody actually thought all the way through. And

1512
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:49,650
Speaker 5:  If I was a horrible person, I would go print out a bunch of these

1513
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:53,300
Speaker 5:  fake labels and put 'em on real products and like Best Buy and

1514
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:54,250
Speaker 5:  then, and then

1515
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:54,650
Speaker 6:  Have people

1516
01:21:54,650 --> 01:21:58,010
Speaker 5:  Shit out. Yeah. When then when people scan it, oh my God.

1517
01:21:58,010 --> 01:22:01,940
Speaker 5:  Just, I don't have the technological know-how and I'm not

1518
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:05,690
Speaker 5:  that horrible yet, so I won't do this. But like, it seems like a very

1519
01:22:05,690 --> 01:22:09,300
Speaker 5:  easy way to cheat this system and screw over a lot of people also. It's

1520
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:10,170
Speaker 5:  ugly.

1521
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:11,760
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's, it's not beautiful.

1522
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,140
Speaker 6:  Yes. I'm, I'm really out. But like,

1523
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:17,000
Speaker 4:  Are they gonna make like a beautiful label that's like insecure wifi?

1524
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,320
Speaker 5:  You know, the UL label is gorgeous.

1525
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,530
Speaker 4:  No one knows what that means.

1526
01:22:20,530 --> 01:22:23,120
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I don't know what it means, but I know it's pretty

1527
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:26,730
Speaker 6:  That's fair. But my thing with this is I think like the, the one of the

1528
01:22:26,730 --> 01:22:30,500
Speaker 6:  comparisons that the FCC, Jeff Jess Rosen made is to like the

1529
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:33,940
Speaker 6:  Energy Star logo. Yeah. Which is a useful thing, right? And they're talking

1530
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:37,670
Speaker 6:  about this a lot with Right to repair stuff too. That you should have these

1531
01:22:37,670 --> 01:22:41,660
Speaker 6:  quick visual signals that like this passes some kind of

1532
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:45,380
Speaker 6:  test that I approve of, right? Like it is, it is energy certified. That's

1533
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:49,260
Speaker 6:  good. It the vibes are good. Right? And with right to repair, it's like that's

1534
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:53,060
Speaker 6:  good too. And this one just seems way

1535
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:56,130
Speaker 6:  higher stakes because you're, what you're asking me to do is make like A

1536
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:59,960
Speaker 6:  real problematic decision about this thing. Whether

1537
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:03,860
Speaker 6:  it is safe or not for me to use based on this label. And with

1538
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:07,770
Speaker 6:  that just would need to come this really complicated enforcement mechanism

1539
01:23:07,770 --> 01:23:11,540
Speaker 6:  that I'm not sure is even really possible to do. Well

1540
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:15,010
Speaker 5:  I like that even the Official

1541
01:23:15,010 --> 01:23:18,620
Speaker 5:  like mockup of it from the FCC is hard to

1542
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:22,600
Speaker 5:  read. Like you have to do some really bad design

1543
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:26,570
Speaker 5:  to be like Yeah, it's also terrible to read. It's, I'm just,

1544
01:23:26,570 --> 01:23:30,000
Speaker 5:  it's ugly. And I. Think you're right. Like how are you supposed to, nothing

1545
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,980
Speaker 5:  is secure if it's connected to the, the internet, it's in some way can

1546
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:36,460
Speaker 5:  be hacked. Someone will figure it out. Well yeah, but

1547
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:40,380
Speaker 4:  I, yes, I, I agree with you broadly on that front. That's

1548
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:40,540
Speaker 4:  how

1549
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:42,040
Speaker 5:  I have lived my life.

1550
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:45,800
Speaker 4:  She said with her Laptop and phone and smartwatch hack

1551
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:49,560
Speaker 4:  me. That's true. But like, we've now covered

1552
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:53,380
Speaker 4:  enough fly by night products. Yeah. I'm thinking

1553
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:57,360
Speaker 4:  of wise, right? Where they made claims, they're backed up by no

1554
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:01,260
Speaker 4:  one. They're unenforceable cuz they're backed up by no one. Like this is

1555
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:04,740
Speaker 4:  a very sort of like, how does a market capitalist

1556
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:08,300
Speaker 4:  government fix problems? Like this is like, we'll put a

1557
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:11,220
Speaker 4:  nutrition label on it. Yeah. And like, this is the answer to every question

1558
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:15,000
Speaker 4:  is like, consumers will count calories, but for gadgets. But like, at least

1559
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,720
Speaker 4:  if you put this label on and you lie, you people can

1560
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:19,280
Speaker 4:  sue you.

1561
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:19,700
Speaker 5:  That's

1562
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:22,130
Speaker 4:  True. And that fair is as much of a corrective as anything.

1563
01:24:22,130 --> 01:24:22,820
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Okay. I'll

1564
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:26,180
Speaker 6:  Give you that. I almost feel like it should be more like the, the like surgeon

1565
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:29,740
Speaker 6:  general's warning on a pack of cigarettes that's just like this thing connects

1566
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:33,660
Speaker 6:  to the internet. Be worried about that is like that's, I, that feels to me

1567
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:37,260
Speaker 6:  like it would be more immediately productive. Yeah. Update.

1568
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:41,140
Speaker 4:  Often the difference between the American surgeon general warning and like

1569
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:45,080
Speaker 4:  the British one is that we, we should do the British ones. Like in Europe,

1570
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:48,980
Speaker 4:  the cigarettes should say, this will kill you. Yeah. Here it's like

1571
01:24:48,980 --> 01:24:52,190
Speaker 4:  Surgeon general's warning a bunch of stuff. And like over there it's like

1572
01:24:52,190 --> 01:24:55,630
Speaker 4:  death. Death lurks here. Delicious

1573
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:59,300
Speaker 4:  death. You'll never stop thinking about it for the rest of your life. If

1574
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:00,760
Speaker 4:  you do this in your twenties.

1575
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:04,120
Speaker 5:  Neil's just quietly pulling the cigarette out as we speak.

1576
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:07,860
Speaker 4:  Oh my God. So good. The first one after a drink, but

1577
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:11,000
Speaker 4:  it'll kill you. All right, I'll stop now.

1578
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,590
Speaker 5:  I was like, I don't even smoke And. I. Want a cigarette now?

1579
01:25:14,590 --> 01:25:17,940
Speaker 4:  Have you ever had one of these after a big dinner? Woo. That'll kill you

1580
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:18,970
Speaker 4:  for sure.

1581
01:25:18,970 --> 01:25:22,310
Speaker 5:  Steak dinner covered in butter.

1582
01:25:22,310 --> 01:25:24,560
Speaker 4:  This is the worst lighting round.

1583
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:28,360
Speaker 6:  That's mine. Neil, what's yours? Wait, I'm sorry. You have four assigns to

1584
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:31,180
Speaker 6:  you here. This podcast has been very long. Pick one

1585
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:34,600
Speaker 4:  All I'm picking one. I'm gonna pick the WordPress one. Okay. Yeah. So our

1586
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:38,480
Speaker 4:  company this week announced that we're switching CMSs. This

1587
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:42,160
Speaker 4:  is so nerdy, but people ask me to talk about it. So if you have been

1588
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:45,950
Speaker 4:  following us since 2011, you know that right now one of our

1589
01:25:45,950 --> 01:25:48,760
Speaker 4:  CMSs that we use is a proprietary CMS called Chorus that we have made a lot

1590
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:52,540
Speaker 4:  of noise about over the decade of this company. Chorus

1591
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:55,700
Speaker 4:  is a lot of things. If you are a webinar nerd, you know that a CMS

1592
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:59,240
Speaker 4:  is. It's the database from which we serve the

1593
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:03,060
Speaker 4:  website. And CMSs can do an awful lot of things at a

1594
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:06,860
Speaker 4:  basic level. The CMS is a text editor and a database of

1595
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:10,380
Speaker 4:  content. And sometimes it's also the front end of the

1596
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:13,780
Speaker 4:  website. So you, you can separate those things with our

1597
01:26:13,780 --> 01:26:17,020
Speaker 4:  redesign. We decoupled the front end of the website. The thing that you all

1598
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:20,580
Speaker 4:  look at at The Verge dot com from the back end, which is what we all type

1599
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:24,540
Speaker 4:  in. So now through an api, you go to Verge dot com, the API pulls

1600
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:28,420
Speaker 4:  outta the database, whatever, which means you can sw swap out the backend

1601
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:32,260
Speaker 4:  of the thing. We already use multiple CMSs to

1602
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:35,980
Speaker 4:  make The Verge all the time. One of our CMSs is Google Sheets. And. I

1603
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:39,620
Speaker 4:  Promise you every big publisher from the time on Down has content that is

1604
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:40,780
Speaker 4:  served out of Google Sheets.

1605
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:42,650
Speaker 6:  I can confirm this. Yeah,

1606
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:46,460
Speaker 4:  It's just a useful, like, it's a really powerful spreadsheet that never

1607
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:49,880
Speaker 4:  goes down. Like you could, if you need to make that kind of thing, you can

1608
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:53,780
Speaker 4:  do it. When we do our live blogs, we use a CMS called NorCon

1609
01:26:53,780 --> 01:26:57,620
Speaker 4:  Live Center, which hilariously is, I think most of our clients are like English

1610
01:26:57,620 --> 01:27:01,500
Speaker 4:  Premier League blogs. So there's a bunch of features in Live

1611
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:05,430
Speaker 4:  Center that I always want to use that make no sense. Like a running

1612
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:06,220
Speaker 4:  score tally

1613
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:07,770
Speaker 6:  A button that just says Goal.

1614
01:27:07,770 --> 01:27:11,460
Speaker 4:  Yeah, that's like very funny. We, I just, I'm dying to use

1615
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:13,820
Speaker 4:  those features. If you can figure them out, we'll do them in the next Apple

1616
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:17,300
Speaker 4:  event. But that's another CMS we use. I I think all of you know, I'm excited

1617
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:20,900
Speaker 4:  about Activity Pub. I think plugging a social

1618
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:24,820
Speaker 4:  network into our stack of things, you can

1619
01:27:24,820 --> 01:27:28,580
Speaker 4:  See how a threads post and a quick post on our front page are closer in

1620
01:27:28,580 --> 01:27:31,740
Speaker 4:  spirit than not. There's a lot you could do there if you think of that as

1621
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:35,560
Speaker 4:  a CMS. So we're swapping out chorus, which

1622
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:39,460
Speaker 4:  is our main CMS that we write most things in for WordPress. But we're keeping

1623
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:42,690
Speaker 4:  the front end experience of the site cuz we've decoupled the two things.

1624
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:46,110
Speaker 4:  That's the answer it. And it's a big emotional decision at our

1625
01:27:46,110 --> 01:27:49,830
Speaker 4:  company. A lot of us, I, most of my life's work has

1626
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:53,730
Speaker 4:  been produced in chorus. There, there it is. I I, I feel a

1627
01:27:53,730 --> 01:27:56,450
Speaker 4:  way about it, but people ask me why it's happening. Cause I saw the Axios

1628
01:27:56,450 --> 01:28:00,290
Speaker 4:  article and it's, you wanna spend your developer effort on

1629
01:28:00,290 --> 01:28:03,850
Speaker 4:  building new kinds of products. Not making a word processor in a

1630
01:28:03,850 --> 01:28:07,070
Speaker 4:  database. That's, that's life and software. I keep sending people the video

1631
01:28:07,070 --> 01:28:10,770
Speaker 4:  of Steve Jobs doing a funeral for macOS nine. I don't think this is going

1632
01:28:10,770 --> 01:28:14,330
Speaker 4:  over as well as I wanted to, but I think it's very funny. Jesus, that's what

1633
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:17,320
Speaker 4:  I got for you. All right. What's your lightning around Alex?

1634
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:20,970
Speaker 5:  Omar thought he ordered coffee this week. Okay. And he's like, wait a minute.

1635
01:28:20,970 --> 01:28:23,810
Speaker 5:  I don't, I don't use the Starbucks app that often. And it was because there

1636
01:28:23,810 --> 01:28:27,330
Speaker 5:  was a bug with a Starbucks app and so it told a whole bunch of users that

1637
01:28:27,330 --> 01:28:29,930
Speaker 5:  they all ordered coffee this week. Amazing. Very good. Everybody was like,

1638
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:32,610
Speaker 5:  wait a minute, but I didn't And I. Just think that's

1639
01:28:32,610 --> 01:28:35,970
Speaker 6:  Hysterical. Was it the intern? This is my favorite thing that happens. Like

1640
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:39,370
Speaker 6:  when that, what was it? The HBO sent that test email to like millions of

1641
01:28:39,370 --> 01:28:43,120
Speaker 6:  people a while ago. Cuz somebody pressed the wrong thing. It's like

1642
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:46,690
Speaker 6:  when, when you hit the, when you mean to hit the test button and you accidentally

1643
01:28:46,690 --> 01:28:49,970
Speaker 6:  hit the, send this to everybody button it just know that it always makes

1644
01:28:49,970 --> 01:28:51,320
Speaker 6:  me happy every single time.

1645
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:54,890
Speaker 5:  What they, what they told Omar was earlier today, a push notification from

1646
01:28:54,890 --> 01:28:58,530
Speaker 5:  the Starbucks app was sent as an error. So yes,

1647
01:28:58,530 --> 01:29:00,170
Speaker 5:  it probably was. And then turned

1648
01:29:00,170 --> 01:29:01,640
Speaker 6:  Somebody clicked the wrong button. Boop.

1649
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:05,060
Speaker 5:  Yep. Everybody got coffee. Nobody's getting free coffee out of this. You

1650
01:29:05,060 --> 01:29:07,320
Speaker 5:  still have to pay for coffee at Starbucks.

1651
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:11,220
Speaker 6:  But I do. It's also like Starbucks should learn from this because

1652
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:15,100
Speaker 6:  this is an incredible marketing thing to do to just randomly ping

1653
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:18,730
Speaker 6:  someone's phone and say your order is ready. It's like, oh yeah. The

1654
01:29:18,730 --> 01:29:21,960
Speaker 6:  Pavlovian thing that would happen to me where I would just go to Starbucks

1655
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:24,720
Speaker 6:  if I got that notification, I'd be like, I don't remember ordering Starbucks,

1656
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:28,520
Speaker 6:  but there's like a 60% chance I did. I'm gonna go, it would work.

1657
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:29,580
Speaker 6:  I'm just saying Starbucks.

1658
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:33,060
Speaker 4:  I would definitely think that my identity had been stolen. I would've a vastly

1659
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:35,420
Speaker 4:  different response. I'd be like, I need to throw my phone in the ocean right

1660
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:36,900
Speaker 4:  away and call my mom. Like

1661
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:40,290
Speaker 5:  I would just assume I blacked out and ordered Starbucks.

1662
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:43,620
Speaker 4:  Yeah, fair enough. I can't believe we just gave Starbucks this idea. I'm

1663
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:46,000
Speaker 4:  so sorry. Talk about engagement based

1664
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,120
Speaker 5:  To delete the Starbucks app.

1665
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:50,960
Speaker 6:  Did I ever tell you about the time I gave Amazon an idea

1666
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:53,820
Speaker 6:  for an ad that they used and didn't give me credit for? And I'm furious about

1667
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:54,000
Speaker 6:  it.

1668
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,420
Speaker 4:  Gee, you should go on strike. Yeah, go

1669
01:29:55,420 --> 01:29:58,060
Speaker 5:  On strike. Don't give

1670
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:01,960
Speaker 4:  Your ideas. We're way over. We will tell you that story next week. Fair enough.

1671
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:05,860
Speaker 4:  On this The Vergecast, some things I want you to read on our site, we

1672
01:30:05,860 --> 01:30:09,580
Speaker 4:  have an excerpt of John Romero's autobiography Doom Guy, which is a story

1673
01:30:09,580 --> 01:30:13,050
Speaker 4:  of S software. Go read that. It's a great story's great good yarn. And then

1674
01:30:13,050 --> 01:30:16,780
Speaker 4:  McKenna Kelly wrote an incredible profile of Gigi Sohn and how her

1675
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:20,090
Speaker 4:  nomination to be an Fs sec commissioner was basically

1676
01:30:20,090 --> 01:30:23,910
Speaker 4:  just overturned by weird, dark money in telecom lobbyists.

1677
01:30:23,910 --> 01:30:27,440
Speaker 4:  It'll make you angry, but in a like a righteous way, it's good's. Great.

1678
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:30,400
Speaker 4:  That's a good feeling. You wanna harness that, that feeling. And then on

1679
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:34,200
Speaker 4:  the Dakota, I asked the CEO, Squarespace, why anyone should make a website

1680
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:37,960
Speaker 4:  And. I'm pretty sure I sold him a pressure washer. That's, it's a weird

1681
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:41,780
Speaker 4:  one. It was. It was those, those two

1682
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:45,640
Speaker 4:  ideas, I promise they connect. It was great. Okay, that's it.

1683
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:46,180
Speaker 4:  That's for

1684
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:51,280
Speaker 4:  Chas

1685
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:54,820
