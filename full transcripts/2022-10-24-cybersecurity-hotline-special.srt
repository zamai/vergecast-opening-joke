Speaker 1:  Support for this episode comes from Zelle. You'd never

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,820
Speaker 1:  fall for an online scam, right? You use

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,460
Speaker 1:  two factor authentication, ignore calls from everyone named

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,660
Speaker 1:  spam risk and never use the password.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:15,900
Speaker 1:  Password.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,260
Speaker 1:  But scammers are getting more sophisticated and more active,

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,900
Speaker 1:  which means they're finding millions of new victims every

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,740
Speaker 1:  single year. The good news is that there's a lot you can do to

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,700
Speaker 1:  protect yourself on the wild, wild web. For starters,

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,420
Speaker 1:  Zelle wants to remind you only send money to people you know

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,420
Speaker 1:  and trust. Zelle is available to United States bank account

13
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,420
Speaker 1:  holders only terms and conditions apply.

14
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,140
Speaker 2:  Welcome

15
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,060
Speaker 3:  To the Verge Cast, the flagship podcast of turning off wifi

16
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:04,020
Speaker 3:  on all of your devices and putting on tinfoil hats. I'm your friend David Pierce.

17
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,780
Speaker 3:  Russell Brando is here. Hi Russell.

18
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:06,700
Speaker 4:  Hi.

19
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,820
Speaker 3:  And this is a, this is very special Vergecast episode. This is,

20
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,380
Speaker 3:  is this the second week of cybersecurity week Russell? Is this like infrastructure

21
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,460
Speaker 3:  week? It's kind of every week. I,

22
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,740
Speaker 4:  Well, I, it's hard because for me every week is cybersecurity week. That's

23
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:18,860
Speaker 3:  Fair.

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,380
Speaker 4:  And it should be for you too,

25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,140
Speaker 3:  But here, here on the Verge cast today is cybersecurity week, I

26
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:25,300
Speaker 3:  guess.

27
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,300
Speaker 4:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,180
Speaker 3:  And we were thinking about a bunch of things to do and we decided that the

29
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,020
Speaker 3:  best thing we could do is just see what everyone wanted

30
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,540
Speaker 3:  to know about. So we opened up the Verge Cast hotline. We got a bunch of

31
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,740
Speaker 3:  really great questions. You and I have been doing a bunch of research in

32
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,020
Speaker 3:  prep and talking to folks, and we are gonna just roll through some of the

33
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,740
Speaker 3:  most interesting and popular questions we got. It's gonna be fun. I'm, I'm

34
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,460
Speaker 3:  very excited. I have been out some weird rabbit holes in getting ready for

35
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,820
Speaker 3:  this that I did not expect. I don't know how it's been for you, but it's,

36
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,220
Speaker 3:  I'm in a weird corner of the internet

37
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,340
Speaker 4:  Now. Oh yeah. I've, I've learned about myself and cybersecurity.

38
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,260
Speaker 3:  It's beautiful. Isn't that, It's really the same thing if you think about

39
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:58,420
Speaker 3:  it.

40
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,330
Speaker 4:  It's really wonder. No, no, they're, they're different.

41
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,970
Speaker 3:  Alright, let's get to our first question, which I think let's just start

42
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:08,410
Speaker 3:  with, I think the one that is actually in a strange way, the easiest to answer,

43
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,930
Speaker 3:  which is from Alex.

44
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,650
Speaker 5:  Hey there, this is Alex from Madison, Wisconsin.

45
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,530
Speaker 5:  I'm walking, walking my dog in the Bri Wisconsin

46
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,410
Speaker 5:  evening. And I had a question about a

47
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,330
Speaker 5:  browser malware extension. So I

48
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,970
Speaker 5:  recently cleaned my computer of something called Bundle

49
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,450
Speaker 5:  and it was really weird. It, it sort of, it,

50
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,290
Speaker 5:  it hid itself by making it so that whenever I tried to

51
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,010
Speaker 5:  access the page to manage my extensions, it just wouldn't go there. It was

52
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,010
Speaker 5:  like redirect the traffic. What I have is

53
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,370
Speaker 5:  whenever I tried to search for something in the like

54
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,010
Speaker 5:  Chrome search bar, it would redirect my search to Bing.

55
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,970
Speaker 5:  Why would I do that? What, what benefit does some malware program have

56
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,920
Speaker 5:  of redirecting my search through Bing instead of Google also who

57
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,750
Speaker 5:  uses Bing? Thank you.

58
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,910
Speaker 4:  Malware victims. There's

59
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,870
Speaker 3:  Apparently good questions in here. Yeah. Who uses Bing is no one on purpose,

60
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:12,350
Speaker 3:  but sometimes it happens. We, we've all been there. You just end up on Bing.

61
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,950
Speaker 3:  You don't know how you got there. You don't, you don't know where you are,

62
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,750
Speaker 3:  but it's dark outside and you're, you're bleeding from

63
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,790
Speaker 3:  somewhere and you don't know.

64
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,190
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So I, there's a lot to dig into here. I will say the thing that's,

65
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,270
Speaker 4:  that that I was kind of coming around to listening to this is

66
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,190
Speaker 4:  a lot of people being savvy about security

67
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,790
Speaker 4:  is sort of knowing implicitly what to trust. So it's like,

68
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,470
Speaker 4:  is it sketchy if I, you know, I'm reading

69
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,470
Speaker 4:  my credit card number out over the phone. Yep. And it's like, well if

70
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,870
Speaker 4:  you called the restaurant and their thing is down, like that's not actually

71
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,550
Speaker 4:  that weird. Like you're probably okay, it's okay to put your credit card

72
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:56,350
Speaker 4:  number into amazon.com. Like it's fine. And, and then like

73
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,230
Speaker 4:  there's other things where I got a weird email and lots of stuff is misspelled.

74
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,630
Speaker 4:  It's like that's obviously sketchy. You should, you should be careful I think

75
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,830
Speaker 4:  browser extensions and particularly bundled browser

76
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,740
Speaker 4:  extensions cuz he mentioned that he got this bundle. People who work

77
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,620
Speaker 4:  in this stuff have known for a while that this is a real

78
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,060
Speaker 4:  sort of place where scams happen and just, Yep. It's a

79
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,780
Speaker 4:  mess in there and you shouldn't trust anything. But I don't know if

80
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,420
Speaker 4:  the average user has really gotten around to like

81
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,180
Speaker 4:  the vast majority of browser extensions are

82
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,660
Speaker 4:  actively exploited and harmful and bad.

83
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,700
Speaker 3:  Well I'm not, I vast majority might be slightly overstated, but it

84
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,340
Speaker 3:  is. There's

85
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,940
Speaker 4:  A lot of, there's a lot of crap. There's a lot of crap I guess.

86
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,460
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Well and it's, and it's tricky because like over the years

87
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:47,340
Speaker 3:  Google Chrome in particular has sort of devoted more and more

88
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,380
Speaker 3:  resources to fighting that. But even still, it's basically like an

89
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,980
Speaker 3:  automated system. And the thing that's crazy about Chrome extensions and

90
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,940
Speaker 3:  browser extensions in general is when you install them, most of

91
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,820
Speaker 3:  them require you to give them access to everything you do inside of your

92
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,140
Speaker 3:  browser. Like in order to do the very basic thing that they want to do,

93
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,340
Speaker 3:  you have to, because there's no like middle setting in many cases

94
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,140
Speaker 3:  you have to turn on like Sure. Read later app. You can see

95
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,100
Speaker 3:  every single thing I do in my browser and that's just bonkers and it's

96
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,580
Speaker 3:  like systemically, this

97
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,260
Speaker 4:  Is not like you can replace what I'm seeing

98
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:27,140
Speaker 4:  on the screen with other stuff. Yes. So you know that there, like the

99
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,780
Speaker 4:  classic joke extension is like, we made it so it replaces the word

100
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,620
Speaker 4:  millennial with snake people. Like, haha isn't that funny? It's like, no,

101
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,500
Speaker 4:  this is, you're looking at the website and what you're seeing is

102
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,460
Speaker 4:  something different from what the website is trying to show you. Like do

103
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,700
Speaker 4:  you not see how this is potentially a problem?

104
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,860
Speaker 3:  We had one of those when I was at Wired, this was during the 2016 election

105
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,820
Speaker 3:  and somebody had downloaded a bunch of like jokey

106
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,700
Speaker 3:  political extensions onto their computer and one of them replaced every

107
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,920
Speaker 3:  mention of Donald Trump with the phrase Tiny Hands. And,

108
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,560
Speaker 3:  and it's like a very funny joke cuz you're reading the internet. But then

109
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,680
Speaker 3:  they filed a story about Donald Trump and

110
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,800
Speaker 3:  missed one of the times where the browser had changed like in

111
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,640
Speaker 3:  our CMS to Tiny Hands. So we published a story in which

112
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,680
Speaker 3:  this person had typed Donald Trump and it spit out tiny

113
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,680
Speaker 3:  hands. It was really, it was really something special

114
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,450
Speaker 4:  Man. Yeah. Okay, so so

115
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,530
Speaker 4:  what he said bundle this is I, I did wanna, I want to see on this too

116
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:32,410
Speaker 4:  because a lot of what happens is you were talking about Chrome.

117
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,790
Speaker 4:  So like Chrome's a very popular browser as you know,

118
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,790
Speaker 4:  it's free and a calm and scammy thing is people will bundle

119
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,750
Speaker 4:  free software with this predatory unwanted

120
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:48,750
Speaker 4:  software if we're allowed to call it malware, spyware, adware.

121
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,110
Speaker 4:  It like gets into weird legal territory. Sure. But basically there's the

122
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,790
Speaker 4:  software you want and you should just get that. But instead you're getting

123
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,710
Speaker 4:  this bundle that has a bunch of other bad things in it. And

124
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,670
Speaker 4:  that happens very often with browsers. I suspect that what

125
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,470
Speaker 4:  is happening here, the reason it's sending him to Bing is there is

126
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:11,370
Speaker 4:  some, I don't think Microsoft is purposefully

127
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,090
Speaker 4:  paying this like adware company. Like I don't think that

128
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,610
Speaker 4:  that's what's happening. But it is broadly true

129
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,200
Speaker 4:  that like Google pays Mozilla

130
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,960
Speaker 4:  to have the default Firefox search go to google.com

131
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:30,800
Speaker 4:  because Google makes money through advertising when people search things

132
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,280
Speaker 4:  on google.com. And so for a while they were paying

133
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,040
Speaker 4:  Apple, I mean they're still paying Apple, right? For, for the iPhone searches

134
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,880
Speaker 4:  that direct to google.com billions of dollars. So

135
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,600
Speaker 4:  I suspect that one way or another that

136
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,400
Speaker 4:  money is going from being to

137
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,320
Speaker 4:  these scammy people with lots of intermediaries that make it

138
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,880
Speaker 4:  hard for Bing to know who exactly they're paying. Yeah,

139
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,880
Speaker 3:  I think that's right. And that like, to be clear, all of that can be done

140
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,640
Speaker 3:  without Microsoft doing anything nefarious or even anything at all.

141
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,440
Speaker 3:  Like I think it's very unlikely that Microsoft is like loading adware into

142
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,960
Speaker 3:  Chrome extensions. It'd be amazing if that were true, but I mean it'd be

143
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,200
Speaker 3:  amazing.

144
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,240
Speaker 4:  I think it's, I think it's probably a Microsoft executive who had had too

145
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,080
Speaker 4:  much and sort of went joker mode and then they're like, we don't know

146
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,600
Speaker 4:  what happened to

147
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,280
Speaker 3:  Him. Just call it bundle, leave it alone. He

148
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,200
Speaker 4:  Just makes, he just makes it ad where now.

149
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:26,200
Speaker 3:  No, but it is one of the main things that these extensions

150
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:30,000
Speaker 3:  do is they will insert ads onto

151
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,800
Speaker 3:  websites in such a way that if you then click those ads,

152
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,280
Speaker 3:  they make money. Right. So like the main two things, a browser extension

153
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,120
Speaker 3:  that you don't want will do is collect all of your data and sell it to somebody

154
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:45,440
Speaker 3:  or put ads into your experience or replace the ads you're

155
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,360
Speaker 3:  seeing with other ads and make money that way. So it's

156
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,880
Speaker 3:  like 98% of the time it's like if some hack is happening on the internet,

157
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,040
Speaker 3:  it's somebody trying to find like a cheap way to make money, right? Like,

158
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,880
Speaker 3:  like that's usually what this is. Yeah. And in in this case, that is kind

159
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,680
Speaker 3:  of the overwhelming thing And one of the things that I've seen a lot of,

160
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,320
Speaker 3:  and there was this big story, I forget when relatively recently where

161
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,120
Speaker 3:  McAfee found a bunch of really well known Chrome extensions

162
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,560
Speaker 3:  including the one Netflix party where you can like CoWatch Netflix with your

163
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,360
Speaker 3:  friends. What Netflix party was doing was all the things Netflix

164
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,040
Speaker 3:  party was supposed to do. But then also doing things

165
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,880
Speaker 3:  like adding affiliate links when you go to e-commerce websites

166
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,840
Speaker 3:  so that it makes money and all this is just like sneakily happening in the

167
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,440
Speaker 3:  background and you never see it because it's able to get in between you and

168
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,800
Speaker 3:  the browser because that's what Chrome extensions do. And so it's just that

169
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,440
Speaker 3:  kind of thing that it's like often you might not even notice but they are,

170
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,680
Speaker 3:  they are aware of what you're doing and they're either changing it in some

171
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,560
Speaker 3:  way or taking something from you. So my read of it is not that

172
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,320
Speaker 3:  like all chrome extensions are dangerous, I do think the fact that they automatically

173
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,240
Speaker 3:  update in the background without telling you is dangerous, but also like

174
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,760
Speaker 3:  it is the kind of thing that you should be super, super, super aware of what

175
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,680
Speaker 3:  you're downloading and make sure, the advice I always give people is never

176
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,440
Speaker 3:  search in the store. Always go from like if you're looking for an app's Chrome

177
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,160
Speaker 3:  extension, go to the app and find the link to the Chrome extension from there.

178
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,920
Speaker 3:  Cuz if you go into the Chrome web store and search for an app, you're gonna

179
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,440
Speaker 3:  get a hundred things that all look the same. 99 of them are scammy and one

180
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,840
Speaker 3:  of them is real and it's often very hard to know. So if you need to have

181
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,040
Speaker 3:  a Chrome extension and you should use only the bare minimum for all the reasons

182
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,760
Speaker 3:  we've been describing, like find it from somewhere else. Don't just go hunting

183
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,920
Speaker 3:  through the Chrome store for things that seem cool because like there be

184
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,360
Speaker 3:  dragons.

185
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,480
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And, and if you're listening to this and and being like, what can I

186
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,120
Speaker 4:  do? Like go to your Chrome, you know,

187
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,040
Speaker 4:  check out what the extensions are. It's chrome colon

188
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,920
Speaker 4:  slash slash extensions. Right. But you can see

189
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,240
Speaker 4:  it'll just show you everything and you can

190
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,640
Speaker 4:  like a absolutely delete anything you do not recognize or that you are like,

191
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,040
Speaker 4:  oh I sort of remember installing that, but I don't really use it. Like you

192
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,200
Speaker 4:  should really have as few as possible. Yeah,

193
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,200
Speaker 3:  A hundred percent. If you, if you don't use it like every day, you probably

194
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,000
Speaker 3:  shouldn't have it. It's, it's worth the like extra two clicks

195
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,800
Speaker 3:  in the browser to not have this stuff sitting between you and everything

196
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,560
Speaker 3:  you do on the internet is my general read.

197
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,200
Speaker 4:  Totally. All right, should we do another one?

198
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,960
Speaker 3:  Yeah, let's, let's move on. So let's see, we have, we have a couple

199
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,800
Speaker 3:  in a row about passwords. So let's, let's knock those out first.

200
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,880
Speaker 3:  First we have one from Eduardo to that

201
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,760
Speaker 6:  Hello the Verge team. Second question about

202
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,120
Speaker 6:  passwords. I use different passwords for every single app

203
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,640
Speaker 6:  or website that I log into, but

204
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,640
Speaker 6:  I'm deeply into the Apple ecosystem. So my question

205
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,560
Speaker 6:  is should I go into the suggested

206
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,880
Speaker 6:  passwords or should I just keep using my own

207
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,960
Speaker 6:  different passwords for everything? Is there any

208
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,880
Speaker 6:  drawback on going into the Apple passwords

209
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,160
Speaker 6:  or we'll all be able to do everything

210
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,400
Speaker 6:  I've been doing so far. Thanks.

211
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,290
Speaker 3:  Okay, so first of all Eduardo, kudos for using different passwords for

212
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,250
Speaker 3:  everything that immediately puts you ahead of almost everybody. So congratulations.

213
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,890
Speaker 3:  This is the question that sent me down the deepest, weirdest rabbit hole

214
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,890
Speaker 3:  of any of the questions we got. But before I get real weird about random

215
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,850
Speaker 3:  number generators, which is gonna happen, what are your thoughts Russell?

216
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,490
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I mean I think, so partially this is like a question about password

217
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,290
Speaker 4:  strength, right? Because if he's coming up with these different passwords,

218
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:30,330
Speaker 4:  they're presumably sort of human comprehensible passwords. Yes.

219
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,170
Speaker 4:  Not just random strengths of, And so it's like is it better to

220
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,730
Speaker 4:  use the random strings that Apple is using? And I don't

221
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,050
Speaker 4:  think it's a huge deal. I think the main,

222
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,850
Speaker 4:  so the the, the place where your password strength is

223
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,730
Speaker 4:  most likely to be tested is you can't just guess

224
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,770
Speaker 4:  millions of passwords at once on like the Gmail login screen.

225
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:57,610
Speaker 4:  Like they will, they will catch on, they're like, this seems like a robot

226
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,850
Speaker 4:  is just doing 1, 2, 3 and then the next one.

227
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,250
Speaker 4:  But occasionally hash is hashed versions. So

228
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,130
Speaker 4:  hash is what the website is checking your password against. It sort of has

229
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:13,010
Speaker 4:  a hashing function that does a special dance to the password

230
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,850
Speaker 4:  that you inputted and then it checks it against, well this is

231
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,810
Speaker 4:  what all this is what the correct password should look like after the special

232
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:23,450
Speaker 4:  dance so that it doesn't just immediately know what your password is and

233
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:26,890
Speaker 4:  have that information for everything. And so you're not supposed to be able

234
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,850
Speaker 4:  to work back from the hash to the actual password, but if you

235
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,370
Speaker 4:  already know what the password is or you have, if

236
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:38,370
Speaker 4:  you like check a bunch of really common passwords and then that can help

237
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,690
Speaker 4:  you crack the hashing algorithm and undo the other ones,

238
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,050
Speaker 4:  then it's a problem. But like the difference between

239
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,090
Speaker 4:  a fairly uncommon word that's in a dictionary and a couple like

240
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,690
Speaker 4:  random characters and the complete gobbly book that

241
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,850
Speaker 4:  Apple spits out is just really not that significant. And I

242
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,730
Speaker 4:  wouldn't worry about it. I think the main question is like are you more

243
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,690
Speaker 4:  likely to lose it because it's not automatically being

244
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,210
Speaker 4:  logged by Apple's password manager, but that

245
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:13,770
Speaker 4:  also doesn't seem like a huge difference since it sounds like this system

246
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,490
Speaker 4:  is working for him.

247
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,650
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I think I agree with all of that actually. And I think the, the

248
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,570
Speaker 3:  two parts of this just jumped out to me are one the like

249
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,210
Speaker 3:  convenience thing you just talked about and I think to me the biggest

250
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:30,490
Speaker 3:  downside of using apple's the, the whole like key chain

251
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:34,410
Speaker 3:  system within Apple is it's very convenient but it's also tied to all of

252
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:37,810
Speaker 3:  your other Apple stuff, right? And like one very common sense cybersecurity

253
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,290
Speaker 3:  piece of advice is don't have all your eggs in one basket. And so

254
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,970
Speaker 3:  the idea of if somebody gets into my iCloud they can also get into my password

255
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,010
Speaker 3:  should make you nervous and there's a, there are good ways to get around

256
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,610
Speaker 3:  that by like protecting your iCloud and multifactor authentication and all

257
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:54,000
Speaker 3:  that stuff stuff. But like I would, I would say the only reason not to do

258
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,360
Speaker 3:  it is that a, it's not very cross platform. So if you use other devices pass

259
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,360
Speaker 3:  key chain doesn't work all that well and it is attached to all of your other

260
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,960
Speaker 3:  Apple stuff. So do it that way. You will, To your point about the randomness,

261
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,560
Speaker 3:  I think you're exactly right. I think my worry would be that for somebody

262
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,840
Speaker 3:  like our friend Eduardo here, that when they say I have different passwords

263
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,440
Speaker 3:  for everything, what they actually mean is like variations on a theme where

264
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,400
Speaker 3:  it's like I have one password that is like cool kids and then I have

265
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,760
Speaker 3:  another one that's cool kids with two S's and then I have one that's cool

266
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,440
Speaker 3:  kids six and that is not great password hygiene,

267
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,600
Speaker 3:  it's better than having the same password for everything, but it's not great

268
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,040
Speaker 3:  password hygiene because Well

269
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:33,920
Speaker 4:  Go ahead. Yeah. And, and it's worth going into what the attack is there.

270
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,840
Speaker 4:  So there are these like LinkedIn

271
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,760
Speaker 4:  was breached in like 2009 or something 2011, it's, it was

272
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,440
Speaker 4:  a while ago. This is all public, this is not, I'm not blowing up on your

273
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,120
Speaker 4:  spot, but then this means that like anyone on the internet who wants it

274
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,960
Speaker 4:  basically by now has the LinkedIn password I was using

275
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:57,040
Speaker 4:  in 2011. Yes. Right. And so if I was using

276
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,680
Speaker 4:  that for anything else, when they were able to get to it, they

277
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,080
Speaker 4:  probably went through, you know, well what's Russell's Gmail account? What's

278
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,560
Speaker 4:  Russell's other account? Let's see if the same password

279
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,840
Speaker 4:  works. Right? Right. And a lot of times they have this password

280
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,680
Speaker 4:  and the breach isn't public, no one knows about it. And so

281
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:19,840
Speaker 4:  they're likely to have sort of find out about it before you do. Now

282
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,960
Speaker 4:  are they going to try, well, okay, what about Russell's password?

283
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,360
Speaker 4:  But the number's slightly different. Exactly. What about Russell's password?

284
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,280
Speaker 4:  And there's some extra S's on one hand, like they're doing this

285
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,440
Speaker 4:  with 10 million passwords and just running through the list because

286
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,360
Speaker 4:  it's fairly, it's rare that you get a hit, it's just like it's worth

287
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,080
Speaker 4:  it if we get a hit. On the other hand, they have a lot of

288
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,040
Speaker 4:  time and not a lot of these breach things, so they're probably gonna try

289
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,880
Speaker 4:  as much as they can get away with and that's, that's why

290
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,120
Speaker 4:  the password hygiene of like here's this slight alteration

291
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:58,400
Speaker 4:  is not great if a password very, very similar to

292
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,720
Speaker 4:  that gets breached.

293
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:03,360
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I think that's right. And I think the, the deep rabbit hole I went

294
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,080
Speaker 3:  down was about pseudo random number generators and this idea

295
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,000
Speaker 3:  that even things that purport to give you random sets

296
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,800
Speaker 3:  of characters are not random, right? Like computers on their own can't do

297
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,520
Speaker 3:  random. There is the logic. So what they do is they start basically from

298
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,440
Speaker 3:  what's called a seed and then run an algorithm to do what is this, what looks

299
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:25,920
Speaker 3:  a lot like randomness? But if you can figure out what that seed is,

300
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,960
Speaker 3:  you then know where the randomness started from and you can start to figure

301
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,680
Speaker 3:  it out. So Bruce Schneider, who is a, a security researcher who has done

302
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,200
Speaker 3:  a lot of work on this over the years, a thing he talks about that I like

303
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,040
Speaker 3:  and I think is a useful framework to think about all of this is basically

304
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,840
Speaker 3:  like degrees of entropy, right? Like if I, if all of my passwords

305
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,720
Speaker 3:  are one last character off, that's one degree of entropy, right? If

306
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,040
Speaker 3:  you know all of my password except that one character, all you have to do

307
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,200
Speaker 3:  is figure out one thing. But if you, if you don't know any of my password

308
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,880
Speaker 3:  because it's all different, you're starting from nothing and suddenly the

309
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,440
Speaker 3:  like work you have to do to get there is much, much stronger. So I think

310
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,720
Speaker 3:  in a case like this, what I went the rabbit hole I really went down is like,

311
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,560
Speaker 3:  is Apple's pseudo random number generator better than the competition?

312
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,240
Speaker 3:  Pseudo random number generators? And the answer is like, not really.

313
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,000
Speaker 3:  There are a lot of very good ones out there. And the real question is

314
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,840
Speaker 3:  just about a lot of other things that actually, like the random number

315
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,160
Speaker 3:  generators are not likely what's gonna screw up your passwords over time.

316
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:23,440
Speaker 4:  Yeah. That's like, that's like your, you're like, is this plane

317
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,040
Speaker 4:  I'm getting on safe? And they're like, well let's look at the fuel.

318
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:30,520
Speaker 4:  Exactly. Who's using the best tool? It's like, it's, it's, it's probably,

319
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,640
Speaker 4:  it's not gonna come down to that. Is it information?

320
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,800
Speaker 3:  Yes. But is is it, is it gonna be the difference? Almost certainly not.

321
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,560
Speaker 3:  But generally, like what I would say is, is think about entropy, right? And

322
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,040
Speaker 3:  if you want to keep your password as secure as possible, have as much entropy

323
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,280
Speaker 3:  between your different passwords as you possibly can. And if that means letting

324
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,200
Speaker 3:  Apple fill it out for you and save it in ways that everyone agrees are

325
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,040
Speaker 3:  solid and secure, that works. I use one password, which I love

326
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,000
Speaker 3:  very much. I I will stand for one password to anyone who listens. It's

327
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,320
Speaker 3:  a really good password manager. There are a lot of good ones out there and

328
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,080
Speaker 3:  I think having them be randomly selected for me, I don't know

329
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,240
Speaker 3:  most of my passwords. And I like it that way and I feel like that's, that's

330
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,640
Speaker 3:  where everyone should be. Let let a system know my passwords and then I don't

331
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:11,960
Speaker 3:  have to.

332
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,410
Speaker 4:  Absolutely.

333
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:14,650
Speaker 3:  Alright, let's move on.

334
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,410
Speaker 4:  So what's the, what's the other, yeah, what's the other password? I mean

335
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:21,210
Speaker 3:  Our next one is even weirder and I'm very excited. It's from Leon.

336
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:21,970
Speaker 3:  Let's hear it.

337
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,370
Speaker 7:  Hey Vergecast team, it's Leon from Virginia.

338
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,490
Speaker 7:  What's up with websites having a maximum character limit

339
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,970
Speaker 7:  for their passwords? Like why do I have to create a password

340
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,530
Speaker 7:  with a maximum of eight or 12 characters?

341
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,650
Speaker 7:  Why is that safe? Thanks.

342
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,170
Speaker 3:  This is the other question that sent me down a crazy rabbit hole. Yeah. And

343
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,570
Speaker 3:  it was deeply unsatisfied. It's,

344
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:48,450
Speaker 4:  I mean, it's not safe, right? Like broadly these limits are

345
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,290
Speaker 4:  bad security people don't like them. I think that the reason

346
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,090
Speaker 4:  that you see them is kind of has to do with

347
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,890
Speaker 4:  making life easier for the architects of these systems more than

348
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,770
Speaker 4:  like security fundamentals. But it sounds like David, you have

349
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,490
Speaker 4:  a lot of research to, to spill out.

350
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,610
Speaker 3:  No, so you're, you're right, but you're missing one piece of the

351
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:13,690
Speaker 3:  equation, which is users. The simple truth of the matter, based on all the

352
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,970
Speaker 3:  research I've done and all the people I've talked to, is that fundamentally

353
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,010
Speaker 3:  if you allow people to have 500 character passwords, they

354
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,930
Speaker 3:  will forget them. They will type them incorrectly. They will call customer

355
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:27,370
Speaker 3:  service to reset their passwords more often. And that will suck for everyone

356
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:31,410
Speaker 3:  involved. And so I went down looking for like

357
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:35,370
Speaker 3:  really useful technical answers and what it seems like is, on the one

358
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:39,210
Speaker 3:  hand, you're right that like, and especially in the early days of the

359
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:42,810
Speaker 3:  internet, there was a lot of like technological systems that just couldn't

360
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,530
Speaker 3:  handle that much data coming in at the same time. Like if you're sending

361
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:49,680
Speaker 3:  somebody a one megabyte password, that's a lot. And it was especially a lot

362
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,360
Speaker 3:  many years ago. So,

363
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:55,160
Speaker 4:  Well, and and also that like remember there's the hashing algorithms, like

364
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,480
Speaker 4:  if you can know the amount of

365
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,200
Speaker 4:  information very precisely, it lets you, it just sort of

366
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,400
Speaker 4:  smooths things out. Totally.

367
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,840
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And then there that just sort of became the norm. So people kept doing

368
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,320
Speaker 3:  it. But then I was looking and like the, the National Institute of Standards

369
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,920
Speaker 3:  in Technology has a bunch of rules about passwords and what they actually

370
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,120
Speaker 3:  recommend is that you allow at least 64 characters

371
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:21,160
Speaker 3:  because yeah, the, the kind of new password theory

372
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,960
Speaker 3:  is like, what you don't need is just a bunch of like random he decimal stuff,

373
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,880
Speaker 3:  which you need is like a long, relatively random string of words

374
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,920
Speaker 3:  that you can remember that that's actually the most useful thing. Like if

375
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,520
Speaker 3:  it's five words

376
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:32,800
Speaker 4:  In a

377
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,000
Speaker 3:  Row, I, so I will, you can do it.

378
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,600
Speaker 4:  I will say at the risk of compromising my own security, so this is the

379
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,520
Speaker 4:  past phrase, right? Think of some phrase that you remember and I'm a

380
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,160
Speaker 4:  word guy, so I remember phrases like, there are a lot of phrases where

381
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,360
Speaker 4:  I'm like, oh yeah, that one line really meant something to me. And so

382
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,440
Speaker 4:  when we, I was setting up my like work account for

383
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,200
Speaker 4:  Vox Media, I did the phrase and I was like, I'm not gonna, you know,

384
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,680
Speaker 4:  this is gonna be in my password manager, I'm not gonna type this in that

385
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,270
Speaker 4:  much. And then as it went on, it sort of

386
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:08,070
Speaker 4:  propagated until now it's the thing I need to

387
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,590
Speaker 4:  type in every time I wake up my laptop

388
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:15,530
Speaker 4:  and it's like, it's like a bunch of words long, like it's over

389
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:19,450
Speaker 4:  50 characters. It's it, and and also if I can't see

390
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:23,370
Speaker 4:  it, I'll like have a typo sometimes. So it'll take me like two or three tries

391
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,610
Speaker 4:  and I'm just trying to like mute whatever song is playing. It's

392
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:31,250
Speaker 4:  really, so that's a, that's a cautionary tale. I guess

393
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,410
Speaker 3:  It's just like the first chapter of Moby Dick every time you wanna wake up

394
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:34,810
Speaker 3:  your computer.

395
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,330
Speaker 4:  Oh my god, how did you guys, No, but I mean it's really like,

396
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,850
Speaker 4:  yeah, I'm trying not to do it. I'm, I'm trying not to put any information

397
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:45,680
Speaker 4:  out there that would, that would make it easy for that actors. But yeah,

398
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,280
Speaker 4:  it's, so think about the fact that you'll have to

399
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,920
Speaker 4:  maybe type this in a lot,

400
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,720
Speaker 3:  But I think yeah, in general it is. I I think I would agree bad

401
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,040
Speaker 3:  form if they only allow you to have something like eight characters, what

402
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,840
Speaker 3:  does seem to be true is there are pretty severe diminishing returns after

403
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,600
Speaker 3:  about 20, Hmm I dunno if that's a magic number, but it that,

404
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,120
Speaker 3:  that one kind of came up a bunch that like the difference between a 20 character

405
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,320
Speaker 3:  password and a 200 character password is not massive in

406
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,040
Speaker 3:  terms of like, can a regular person brute force their way into getting your

407
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,840
Speaker 3:  password? Whereas the difference between eight and 20 is when it goes from

408
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,240
Speaker 3:  like hard but feasible to hard and sort of infeasible.

409
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:28,240
Speaker 3:  So I think, yeah, if, if you're only allowed to have short passwords, you

410
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,120
Speaker 3:  should, you should yell at them to let you have longer ones is what I would

411
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,280
Speaker 3:  say.

412
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:31,960
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

413
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,440
Speaker 3:  Cool. Do you have short passwords? I feel like I just shamed you by accident.

414
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,920
Speaker 3:  You're changing all your passwords

415
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,480
Speaker 4:  For, I will say I, I changed from on the,

416
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:44,320
Speaker 4:  in the iPhone unlock they give you the option of four

417
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,240
Speaker 4:  numbers, which the security people really don't like. Or six

418
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,160
Speaker 4:  numbers, which is, you know, it's powers of 10 or it's a

419
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,000
Speaker 4:  hundred times more secure or this alpha numeric thing, which

420
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,440
Speaker 4:  you're gonna type in I keyboard, which is probably the best thing to do.

421
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,880
Speaker 4:  But I mean, who has the time? I'm not gonna

422
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,600
Speaker 3:  Honestly like it's, I'm a four, I'm a four digit

423
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:10,520
Speaker 3:  iPhone password person. Wow. And I'm ashamed of it like I am. It's

424
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,080
Speaker 3:  not great and and the best part is it defaults to six and it makes you

425
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,440
Speaker 3:  change to four when you set up your phone it's like, do you wanna make a

426
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,680
Speaker 3:  stupid decision right now? And every time I'm like, yes I do. Thank you for

427
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:20,920
Speaker 3:  asking.

428
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,440
Speaker 3:  I'm very happy to do so. Yeah. Right. We need to take a break and then we're

429
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,480
Speaker 3:  gonna come back and answer a couple more questions, including with our very

430
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,400
Speaker 3:  good friends Eli Patel. We'll be right back.

Speaker 11:  Send me the $500 adoption fee tonight and she's all yours.

436
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,460
Speaker 11:  You send it, you wait and they just

437
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,340
Speaker 11:  disappear. No puppy, no money.

438
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,220
Speaker 10:  You know, everyone thinks these are new since the internet. They're not

439
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:10,700
Speaker 11:  Robert Burda, CEO of the Cyber Crime Support Network says

440
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,300
Speaker 11:  puppy scams are just one example of countless online marketplace

441
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,260
Speaker 11:  scams. Scams aren't new but the Internet's speed and anonymity are,

442
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:22,460
Speaker 10:  They've always exploited human nature. They're always trying to build that

443
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,220
Speaker 10:  sense of urgency. There's nothing that can't wait. Slow

444
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,340
Speaker 10:  down spot check and don't send the money because they know

445
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,820
Speaker 10:  that once they convince you to let it go, very little chance is coming back.

446
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,300
Speaker 11:  Elle wants you to pay it safe, treat every transaction like cash

447
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,460
Speaker 11:  and only send money to people you know and trust. Learn more safety

448
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,020
Speaker 11:  tips@ellepay.com.

449
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:54,240
Speaker 3:  Okay, next up we have a question I think a

450
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,800
Speaker 3:  bunch of us got very excited about this is from our friend Chuck who has

451
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,400
Speaker 3:  a question about babies.

452
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,080
Speaker 12:  Hey guys, this might be very niche so maybe it doesn't go on the show,

453
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,880
Speaker 12:  but maybe it could go on an article sometime I have a

454
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,680
Speaker 12:  newborn and I don't know how to keep her safe from

455
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:14,560
Speaker 12:  online stuff. Like do I need to do anything? Do I do nothing?

456
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:20,380
Speaker 12:  So yeah, I just, I don't want to leave doors

457
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:24,250
Speaker 12:  open, but yeah, I don't, there's nothing good out there

458
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:28,130
Speaker 12:  that says like, do this and you'll be safe. Thanks. Love the show.

459
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:28,370
Speaker 12:  Bye.

460
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,290
Speaker 3:  Okay. I, this question gives me so many feelings and you can just,

461
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:36,210
Speaker 3:  you can just feel the like vibes and energy from

462
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,970
Speaker 3:  this person. Neil Patella is here to help us answer this question. Hello

463
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:41,250
Speaker 3:  Nelia, you are our resident baby expert. Congratulations.

464
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,410
Speaker 4:  That's bad

465
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:42,970
Speaker 13:  For America.

466
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,160
Speaker 4:  You are all that stands between the horrors of the

467
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,920
Speaker 4:  internet and the Children of America and

468
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,200
Speaker 4:  some of Canada.

469
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,160
Speaker 13:  The whole show to parent blogging, that's what I do here. Yeah.

470
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,440
Speaker 3:  I will say has been threatening to do this ever since he had children. So

471
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,840
Speaker 3:  it's, it's gonna happen eventually. What I feel like we, we could start almost

472
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,000
Speaker 3:  anywhere here, but there's like, is there stock parenting

473
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,760
Speaker 3:  advice for what you should do? Like, cuz there, there, there comes a time

474
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,760
Speaker 3:  when like your kid is gonna start wanting to be online and you have to do

475
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,720
Speaker 3:  things about that. But we're talking even way before then. This is the like

476
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,640
Speaker 3:  they don't even know what the internet is yet. Do you have responsibilities

477
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,760
Speaker 3:  to them? Which I think is a super interesting question.

478
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:28,360
Speaker 13:  Yeah, well David, you're about to have a kid so you're gonna become the

479
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,840
Speaker 13:  new, Am I allowed to say that on the show? Do the people know,

480
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,840
Speaker 3:  The people don't know, They know Now I this is, this is as good a time as

481
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,120
Speaker 3:  any, my wife is due December and I'm gonna be the version is the next baby

482
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:38,680
Speaker 3:  correspondent.

483
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,600
Speaker 4:  Congratulations.

484
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,040
Speaker 3:  It's great. Thank you. You

485
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,720
Speaker 13:  Gotta, you gotta rotate in a new one because the kids keep getting relentlessly

486
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,600
Speaker 13:  older. It's a real problem. So here's what I would say

487
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,440
Speaker 13:  to everybody, almost everything about being a first

488
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,320
Speaker 13:  time parent is just how afraid you choose to be and how

489
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,080
Speaker 13:  much you allow corporate America to pray on that fear.

490
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,480
Speaker 13:  The best advice I ever got was from my friend Spencer Hall who some of you

491
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,200
Speaker 13:  may know from other endeavors in the internet and he just looked at me very

492
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,840
Speaker 13:  seriously. I think he has like four kids and he was like, babies are more

493
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,520
Speaker 13:  resilient than you think and if you just hold that in your head, you're

494
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,000
Speaker 13:  gonna be like, just remember people did this before any technology

495
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,680
Speaker 13:  existed. That's how you got here. So he's like, hold onto that. The second

496
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,600
Speaker 13:  thing I'll say much more specifically about computers is

497
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:28,360
Speaker 13:  once you realize that all that's designed to pray in your fear, you realize

498
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,280
Speaker 13:  that a lot of like computer products exist to just reassure you

499
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:35,400
Speaker 13:  that actually provide you like no additional safety.

500
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:40,280
Speaker 13:  So there's like infinity baby monitors and socks

501
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:44,200
Speaker 13:  and snooze that you can buy and you just have to decide how much you

502
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,160
Speaker 13:  wanna like participate in that universe of things. Our decision

503
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,560
Speaker 13:  was that we didn't want anything that required a user

504
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,080
Speaker 13:  account. Ooh. Like we just didn't wanna start sharing data about our kid

505
00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:00,160
Speaker 13:  at any moment. So we did not buy a connected

506
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,760
Speaker 13:  baby camera. We bought the UFE one that's on Amazon I'm sure by now.

507
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,480
Speaker 13:  There are many iterations of it, but there was one that everyone bought

508
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,640
Speaker 13:  and then ufe, which is the division of anchor, came out with like this slightly

509
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,480
Speaker 13:  upgraded riff on that one And we, we just have that one and it works

510
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,320
Speaker 13:  great and it is, you know, like a proprietary RF protocol. It's a

511
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,160
Speaker 13:  rock solid in our house, no wifi involved and it has a little

512
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,080
Speaker 13:  piece of hardware. That's great. So I, we carry around a little

513
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,440
Speaker 13:  screen in our house to watch our kid that is

514
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,000
Speaker 3:  So your your thinking was not only like no user

515
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,920
Speaker 3:  accounts for your kid but no user accounts related to your

516
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,360
Speaker 3:  kid like, cuz it wouldn't have been, it wouldn't have been your kid's name

517
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:42,120
Speaker 3:  on the UVA or on the baby monitor thing, it would've been yours but even

518
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,240
Speaker 3:  still like that crossed the line.

519
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:47,360
Speaker 13:  Yeah, I wanted, I'll use a security term here. I wanted to air gap the baby

520
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,000
Speaker 13:  from the internet for as long as possible.

521
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:51,160
Speaker 3:  Oh I love that. Okay, that's good. Yeah,

522
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,960
Speaker 13:  Right. So I didn't want anything connected to the internet near

523
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,720
Speaker 13:  the baby for as long as I could hold off air

524
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,560
Speaker 3:  Gap. Your baby is a verge t-shirt that needs to, this is a thing we're gonna

525
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,880
Speaker 3:  make onesies, it's gonna say air gap, it's gonna be incredible.

526
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:08,080
Speaker 13:  One thing you're gonna want to do is track a bunch of baby

527
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,960
Speaker 13:  stuff related to a newborn when they eat, when they poop, when they sleep

528
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,920
Speaker 13:  and there's infinity apps that are, you know, you can log into and you can

529
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,480
Speaker 13:  use them and we don't wanna use them. So we use one called Sprout which

530
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,920
Speaker 13:  syncs the database over iCloud to another phone using a key.

531
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:26,480
Speaker 13:  There's no user accounts and they actually advertise it as having no user

532
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,520
Speaker 13:  accounts. Now this is like four years ago, we have not tracked our four

533
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,400
Speaker 13:  year olds sleeping and pooping. We're good. She lets us know when it's

534
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:33,680
Speaker 13:  gonna happen.

535
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:37,920
Speaker 4:  I mean are you weighing it? What, what's the fine grain of the

536
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,840
Speaker 4:  data? How much data on the poop are we collecting here?

537
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:44,520
Speaker 13:  Well so when you have a newborn you don't sleep very often.

538
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,640
Speaker 13:  So your memory of what happened when

539
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:52,160
Speaker 13:  becomes very limited and you're like, did I feed the baby?

540
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,240
Speaker 13:  And you just don't remember and you certainly don't remember how much or

541
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,840
Speaker 13:  what you fed them cause it's like two in the morning. So like how many

542
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,520
Speaker 13:  ounces of milk did I feed? The baby is like, you are just not gonna remember

543
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,600
Speaker 13:  this five hours from now. So you just track that stuff. Just have a log

544
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,000
Speaker 13:  between you and your partner. Cuz ideally one of you is asleep while the

545
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,360
Speaker 13:  other thing is happening. Ideally, I said sometimes it's just a pure panic

546
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,640
Speaker 13:  situation. So we just constantly made choices

547
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:19,400
Speaker 13:  to keep the kid away from the internet and at some

548
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,320
Speaker 13:  point your parenting choice is going to be in order

549
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,680
Speaker 13:  to make this child eat or survive a restaurant or be in an airplane,

550
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,320
Speaker 13:  we're gonna give them a tablet and then all of it kind of goes up the window.

551
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,840
Speaker 13:  But for us anyhow, our choice was very much no user

552
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,480
Speaker 13:  accounts, no wifi connected toys, none of this stuff where I have to become

553
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,440
Speaker 13:  the IT manager of like a very helpless human

554
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,280
Speaker 13:  beings internet presence. Because once you open the door

555
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,600
Speaker 13:  you're just fully down the road.

556
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:49,580
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

557
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,220
Speaker 3:  How about that? The, the only other big picture question I can think of that

558
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,740
Speaker 3:  it would be useful to ask or to like have answers to pretty early on would

559
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:00,620
Speaker 3:  be like how do we take and share pictures of our

560
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,780
Speaker 3:  child in a way that makes us comfortable?

561
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:06,620
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I I will say, so my, I have two

562
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:10,580
Speaker 4:  nieces and my brother, I think I was impressed by this although I

563
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:14,420
Speaker 4:  think maybe some people would be worried about it, but basically they didn't

564
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:18,260
Speaker 4:  want to be on Facebook or putting like have

565
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:21,820
Speaker 4:  for Facebook to have accessible record of various pictures of

566
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:25,900
Speaker 4:  of the girls. And so, but you wanna

567
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,180
Speaker 4:  share it with family. And so they set up this Tumblr

568
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:33,380
Speaker 4:  that is public to the internet but that like only

569
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,900
Speaker 4:  cer like only the family members really have the address to, and it doesn't

570
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,760
Speaker 4:  have their names on it or any like words whatsoever. It's

571
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,640
Speaker 4:  just a public facing webpage on the internet, which I

572
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,120
Speaker 4:  think worked out for them. I mean the main thing is like grandma doesn't

573
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:52,000
Speaker 4:  have to get a Facebook account or like maintain access to a Facebook account,

574
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,800
Speaker 4:  which I think is probably good And like, you know, grandma

575
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,680
Speaker 4:  doesn't really wanna see, Grandma doesn't wanna go on Facebook,

576
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:03,640
Speaker 4:  she just wants to see pictures of her grandchildren. So yes, it's fine. Yeah.

577
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:07,760
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I so I, I don't know if that's like, if that solves every problem

578
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,720
Speaker 4:  but that is a baby picture hack I have heard.

579
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:15,040
Speaker 13:  So that one I buy it right cuz you, you're not inside a big tech like

580
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,680
Speaker 13:  Tumblr is not big tech. It's like small struggling tech.

581
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:21,200
Speaker 4:  Yeah, small to medium tech I think. Yeah.

582
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,720
Speaker 13:  But public to the internet terrifies me. Right. Like that's a, that's just

583
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,040
Speaker 13:  a URL on the internet that could get picked up. That clear view. AI is looking

584
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,120
Speaker 13:  at pictures like who knows, you can't see what's happening.

585
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,840
Speaker 4:  Well it's not tied to their names. Right. So it's just these

586
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,280
Speaker 4:  pictures of people on the internet. It's true. It could get scraped them.

587
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,560
Speaker 4:  I mean they didn't,

588
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:42,040
Speaker 13:  So one day this family is gonna be in a Walmart looking at like empty photo

589
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,760
Speaker 13:  frames and being like, well that is us.

590
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:44,840
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

591
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:50,160
Speaker 13:  Very unfortunate. So we, we kind of went the other way

592
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:54,080
Speaker 13:  which requires more trust but feels more closed. So

593
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,040
Speaker 13:  we, we started with Apple Photos which seemed very closed share photo

594
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,800
Speaker 13:  streams and then more people wanna be involved. And then in particular

595
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,560
Speaker 13:  this thing about grandma wanting to see the photos, we wanted to set up

596
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,600
Speaker 13:  digital photo frames that just had the newest photos on them for various

597
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,080
Speaker 13:  people in our family. So then we switched to Google photos,

598
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,200
Speaker 13:  which Google will insist as a closed private ecosystem.

599
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,680
Speaker 13:  But we were able to just set up Google homes and then

600
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,560
Speaker 13:  lots of digital photo frames, like just the ones you can buy have Google

601
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,080
Speaker 13:  photos, connections. So they just, we just have one album that we add photos

602
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,680
Speaker 13:  to and it shows up on picture frames in our various family member's house.

603
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,000
Speaker 13:  So they don't have to do anything. And the more that I, and that feels like

604
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,640
Speaker 13:  I am just in control of that database of pictures and I am

605
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,120
Speaker 13:  control of who has access to it. And that feels

606
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,000
Speaker 13:  important to me as she's gotten older, as Max has gotten older, I've stopped

607
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,760
Speaker 13:  posting her Instagram as much. I feel like babies are fine and now

608
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,480
Speaker 13:  she's like a person with a personality and I feel very like exploitive

609
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,360
Speaker 13:  of her personality. Like that's just a choice that she's gonna have to make

610
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,240
Speaker 13:  over time and I'm gonna tell her not to do it. But,

611
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:03,040
Speaker 4:  Well I mean if you're, if you're going through the GR sponsorship

612
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,360
Speaker 13:  When she was first

613
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,680
Speaker 4:  Get brand deals and

614
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,080
Speaker 13:  She was first

615
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,080
Speaker 4:  Born, she's gotta be on the gram,

616
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:10,680
Speaker 13:  We gotta get this kid in the catalog and then it turns out Benton doesn't

617
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,640
Speaker 13:  exist anymore. So my one target was gone.

618
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:17,680
Speaker 3:  I dunno, she's got good hair. You could work with that. Yeah. Lot of places

619
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,560
Speaker 3:  to go. Any, are there any other like, I'm just even trying to think about

620
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,520
Speaker 3:  like what are the questions you should be asking early on and like conversations

621
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,960
Speaker 3:  you should be having? Are there other big ones we haven't hit on yet?

622
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,360
Speaker 13:  The main ones are really just how public do you want your

623
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,320
Speaker 13:  child's life to be? Yeah. Right. Like you start to have all these

624
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,080
Speaker 13:  experiences and it turns out being a parent, parent is like among the most

625
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,840
Speaker 13:  universal experience you can have. You can relate to all kinds of people

626
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:44,600
Speaker 13:  just by talking about your child. That's why people talk about their kids

627
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,760
Speaker 13:  so much. It's very annoying before you have a kid and then you have a kid

628
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,240
Speaker 13:  and you realize why it keeps happening. There's a reason people wanna show

629
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:50,440
Speaker 13:  you photos.

630
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,920
Speaker 3:  There's kids in the weather. Like those are the only two things. Yeah.

631
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,560
Speaker 13:  Sort of lots and lots of people have all Yeah. Which is great

632
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,120
Speaker 13:  but there's an instinct to do it very publicly on the internet. There's

633
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,800
Speaker 13:  an instinct to profit running for some people. Like you could be a, a

634
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,240
Speaker 13:  parent YouTuber like all this stuff. I think you gotta make that decision

635
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,040
Speaker 13:  early and like hold onto it because otherwise you're, I

636
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:14,600
Speaker 13:  I think a lot of people are gonna grow up and unless your parents been talking

637
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,320
Speaker 13:  about them in public for a very long time and they are not like they lose,

638
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:22,040
Speaker 13:  they might lose a sense of agency over who they get to be cuz there's this

639
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,800
Speaker 13:  rich backstory about their life. And I think you just have to make that

640
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,040
Speaker 13:  decision that I have thought about that a lot with our kid. I've talked

641
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,680
Speaker 13:  to other parents who think about that a lot. I think there's a rich and

642
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,480
Speaker 13:  very debate about that in the world of the internet,

643
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,040
Speaker 13:  like in the world of internet parenting. And so that's the one that I would

644
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,480
Speaker 13:  just encourage people to think about. It's like really hard to see when

645
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,280
Speaker 13:  you have a newborn. It's just a picture of a newborn like that is kind of

646
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,000
Speaker 13:  a story about you and how much you're not sleeping but soon it becomes a

647
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,040
Speaker 13:  story about them and you gotta flip that switch.

648
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:54,920
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I will say the, the point that the internet is just there to make you

649
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,320
Speaker 3:  afraid and sell you stuff is a useful one to remember and has been very useful

650
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,960
Speaker 3:  for me to remember even in this like we're in the phase now of like trying

651
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,120
Speaker 3:  to figure out like what happens when you give birth and all the things you

652
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,840
Speaker 3:  have to do. And it's like I've started reading about sleep training and the

653
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,320
Speaker 3:  only thing I've learned about sleep training is no matter what you do, you're

654
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,040
Speaker 3:  wrong and you're a bad person and you hate your kids and it costs millions

655
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,240
Speaker 3:  of dollars to buy all the right products to solve all of their problems.

656
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,080
Speaker 3:  And so I just, like, every time I go on the internet now I have to just be

657
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,920
Speaker 3:  like the internet is here to lie to me and sell me things and that is what

658
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,840
Speaker 3:  this is for. And I, I am now like I am everyone's target demo,

659
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,280
Speaker 3:  like new parents are everyone's target demo.

660
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,440
Speaker 13:  Cause you're terrified. Yeah. Yeah. And you and you

661
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,800
Speaker 13:  whatever, whatever you might say about modern society, you don't have all

662
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,920
Speaker 13:  the people around you to keep you from being terrified, which is like a

663
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,240
Speaker 13:  real thing.

664
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,760
Speaker 3:  Right. We need to let you go. We have some more questions to get to you,

665
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,400
Speaker 3:  but thank you and, and you know, good luck to all of us. Good luck Dave.

666
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:47,960
Speaker 13:  I'll buy you some

667
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,160
Speaker 3:  Booze. Alright Russell, we have a couple more. We're just gonna, we're gonna

668
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,560
Speaker 3:  blow through these really fast one that we didn't

669
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,600
Speaker 3:  technically choose to do here. But I just wanna talk about quickly cuz this,

670
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,200
Speaker 3:  this is a thing that comes up a lot in conversations that we have with like

671
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,120
Speaker 3:  regular people thinking about cybersecurity is VPNs. Liam, do we have Ben's

672
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,720
Speaker 3:  question we can play about VPNs?

673
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,600
Speaker 14:  Hey Verge, this is Ben. I've been thinking about

674
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,840
Speaker 14:  subscribing to a VPN service, but it's very

675
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:18,920
Speaker 14:  unclear which one is the best. Some of the most

676
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:23,120
Speaker 14:  promoted ones like Express and Nord VPN

677
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:27,080
Speaker 14:  have questionable audits. And yeah,

678
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:31,120
Speaker 14:  just very curious about what VPN service people should

679
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,360
Speaker 14:  subscribe to. Thanks.

680
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:37,040
Speaker 3:  I love this question because I find find it completely impossible and I

681
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,000
Speaker 3:  feel like we've talked a lot about just deciding who to trust and who not

682
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,400
Speaker 3:  to trust in the course of this episode. Yeah, and I feel like this is sort

683
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,240
Speaker 3:  of the same thing. Like fundamentally if you get

684
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,120
Speaker 3:  a vpn you are, it it it's like, it's like letting someone into

685
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,960
Speaker 3:  your house, right? Like you're, you are giving them a massive amount of

686
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,080
Speaker 3:  theoretical access to your stuff and a lot of them say they don't want it.

687
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,880
Speaker 3:  A lot of 'em say they don't store it, but like you just don't

688
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,040
Speaker 3:  know for absolute certain and it is fundamentally a question of trust. But

689
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,720
Speaker 3:  then if you don't do it, you're trusting, I don't know all of your browser

690
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:13,080
Speaker 3:  extensions and you're trusting Google and you're trusting Facebook, which

691
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,280
Speaker 3:  has all this kind of information. Like you just can't browse the internet

692
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,480
Speaker 3:  without somebody knowing. And at some point you just have to decide who you

693
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,320
Speaker 3:  trust the most. And I feel like it gets very nihilistic for me from there,

694
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,040
Speaker 3:  but that's kind of where I land.

695
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,470
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I, it's funny, I was, I was writing about,

696
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:32,470
Speaker 4:  actually in the wifi coconut piece, there's this question of like, how much

697
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,590
Speaker 4:  control does like a router, like if the bad guy is controlling the

698
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:40,230
Speaker 4:  router that you're logging in through how like that's not good. How much

699
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:44,150
Speaker 4:  of a threat is that? And one of the, I I was thinking about it and I

700
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:48,110
Speaker 4:  realized one of the fundamental things you see in internet technology

701
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,990
Speaker 4:  at all sorts of different levels is you're basically using

702
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:56,150
Speaker 4:  encryption to secure info infrastructure. So it

703
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:59,350
Speaker 4:  doesn't matter who's controlling the router, it doesn't matter who's at the

704
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:03,310
Speaker 4:  is p you know, the router you, you'll have like WPA keys that are keeping

705
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:07,110
Speaker 4:  it from, from sort of being a point of attack. The ISP

706
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:10,870
Speaker 4:  ideal U have ssl and that's that level of encryption. The

707
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:14,040
Speaker 4:  VPN is kind of like adding another one. And so

708
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:18,200
Speaker 4:  there's a sense in which the attacks

709
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:22,240
Speaker 4:  that it helps against are if you are

710
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,400
Speaker 4:  working for a company like it's corporate security

711
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:29,080
Speaker 4:  and they're like, these are the plans to our next hot new airplane

712
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:33,720
Speaker 4:  and the bad guys wanna steal the plant. And so

713
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:38,200
Speaker 4:  we know exactly where the perimeter is of like who we trust and who we

714
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,040
Speaker 4:  don't. And if the VPN is running through the company, then ideally you're

715
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,920
Speaker 4:  not expanding the trust at, you know, at all because it's, it's running

716
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,320
Speaker 4:  through that same infrastructure. It's the same group of people who are gonna

717
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,240
Speaker 4:  have access to it, but you can have sort of an extra

718
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,520
Speaker 4:  layer of protection to log in through the conference wifi

719
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:01,000
Speaker 4:  and not get injected because the only thing you connect to is

720
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:05,200
Speaker 4:  this wi you know, this VPN service which then hardens the tunnel

721
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,000
Speaker 4:  through the rest of it. Right. Having said that, that is not

722
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,080
Speaker 4:  generally how I see people talking about why they're using

723
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:17,240
Speaker 4:  VPNs. Oh honestly, the most, maybe this is cuz I'm hanging

724
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,480
Speaker 4:  with a sketchy crowd, but like the most common thing is people like, well

725
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,320
Speaker 4:  this will keep me from getting sued for pirating movies or

726
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:24,760
Speaker 4:  something. Oh,

727
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,360
Speaker 3:  Absolutely. Or this is how I can watch stuff on Netflix that's only available

728
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,600
Speaker 3:  in another country. Those are the two things I hear the most.

729
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,680
Speaker 4:  Right. Well I, I mean, so the Netflix

730
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,880
Speaker 4:  geolocation thing that might be robust, I don't think that

731
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,760
Speaker 4:  Netflix is really cracking down on it yet because it would just be so,

732
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:46,160
Speaker 4:  it would be so much of a pain for them without, they don't really care if

733
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,400
Speaker 4:  this is happening anyway. So, but anything illegal you're doing,

734
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:53,720
Speaker 4:  if you're paying for a commercial VPN service, it's just

735
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,600
Speaker 4:  another subpoena that the police have to send. So they subpoena the VPN

736
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,080
Speaker 4:  service to then subpoena the ISP to then get to you

737
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,960
Speaker 4:  and like maybe it's in Switzerland so it's harder,

738
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,800
Speaker 4:  but like if you are the dread pirate Roberts or something, this is not going

739
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,200
Speaker 4:  to help you. And I see people talking as if it is,

740
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:16,600
Speaker 4:  and that, that to me is like my main experience

741
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,440
Speaker 4:  of engaging with VPNs. Very rarely do I see it lining up with

742
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:23,560
Speaker 4:  the actual threat model it could protect against

743
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:27,520
Speaker 3:  Yeah. That, that totally tracks. And I think in general, we talked a little

744
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,480
Speaker 3:  bit about VPNs with McKenna a while ago on this show, and one of the

745
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,360
Speaker 3:  things I heard over and over even from VPN people is

746
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:39,320
Speaker 3:  that if you're just a regular person doing regular internet things, you

747
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,040
Speaker 3:  probably don't need one. And even to your point about like what if the bad

748
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,880
Speaker 3:  guys are on the router, Like thanks to things like https, like they

749
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,160
Speaker 3:  can start to know what website I went to,

750
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:52,880
Speaker 3:  but not what I did there. And that stuff is

751
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,320
Speaker 3:  increasingly encrypted and the internet is, is much harder as a result. And

752
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,080
Speaker 3:  so the, the advice I've gotten from folks is basically like if you know

753
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,840
Speaker 3:  you have a specific thing that either you need to avoid being

754
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,680
Speaker 3:  seen for or you have a specific thing you

755
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,320
Speaker 3:  need access to that you can't get access to, those are good reasons to get

756
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,840
Speaker 3:  a vpn. But if you're just like a person in a coffee shop worried about security,

757
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:18,160
Speaker 3:  a VPN to your point is not actually going to solve that

758
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,040
Speaker 3:  sort of same mainstream problem.

759
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:24,080
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Also, I trust my coffee shop more than I trust my

760
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,600
Speaker 4:  family. That's, to me, that's the pinnacle of, they're so nice.

761
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,280
Speaker 3:  Shout out to Russell's coffee shop somewhere in deep upstate New York,

762
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:35,040
Speaker 3:  I think, I don't know who's

763
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:35,280
Speaker 4:  To say.

764
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:38,840
Speaker 3:  Russell doesn't tell us where he is. That's his real cybersecurity trick.

765
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,320
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I I keep operational security. No one knows where I am at any

766
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,560
Speaker 3:  Time. Yeah. He's in a, he's in a dark room with a black background and no

767
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,000
Speaker 3:  one's allowed to know what he's doing. All right, let's move on. We have

768
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,800
Speaker 3:  one more question to do before we get outta here. It is from Emmanuel.

769
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,760
Speaker 3:  Let's hear it. Hey

770
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:56,640
Speaker 15:  Verge, this is Emmanuel. I had a question related to your

771
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,600
Speaker 15:  security podcast that's coming up. I've always wondered what

772
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:04,480
Speaker 15:  could a bad website do to me? So for example, I,

773
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:08,440
Speaker 15:  I clicked on a, on a, a bad ad on, on Google search results

774
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,800
Speaker 15:  and I stayed on the website, didn't do anything. Then close my browser,

775
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,480
Speaker 15:  closed the window. What is the worst thing that could have happened to my

776
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,200
Speaker 15:  machine? Could, could and what could be installed? Like what do I have to

777
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,160
Speaker 15:  worry about? Thanks.

778
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,200
Speaker 3:  This is such a good question and made me realize I also have this question.

779
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:27,360
Speaker 4:  It made me very worried for Emmanuel Safety. Like, we're gonna find

780
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,840
Speaker 4:  out, this is the last communication anyone got

781
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,400
Speaker 3:  Emmanuel's just clicking every link everywhere just to see

782
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:37,200
Speaker 3:  like what could happen, what's the worst? So what's the answer? What is the

783
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:37,800
Speaker 3:  worst that could happen?

784
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:43,200
Speaker 4:  I, to me it's like, it's like what if the brakes stopped

785
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,600
Speaker 4:  working on your car? It's like there are so many bad things that could happen.

786
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:50,400
Speaker 4:  I almost don't even want to think about it. It's like, no, you should be

787
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,400
Speaker 4:  able to use the Right, Well

788
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,280
Speaker 3:  Let's let's frame this slightly differently then like

789
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,240
Speaker 4:  Yeah, yeah. It's,

790
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:58,600
Speaker 3:  I think one, one obvious bad thing that can happen to you on a computer

791
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:02,600
Speaker 3:  is that like you go to a website and it installs a keylogger and takes

792
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,920
Speaker 3:  your credit card information, right. Like that we grant, But I think the,

793
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,600
Speaker 3:  what seems to me to be implicit in this question is if I go to a bad

794
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,560
Speaker 3:  website and I leave that bad website before I do anything, can it do

795
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,600
Speaker 3:  anything to my computer after I leave the website?

796
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:21,080
Speaker 3:  And the answer to that I think is like unequivocally Yes, absolutely. Right?

797
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:24,920
Speaker 4:  Yeah, because you loaded loading the website. When, when we say

798
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,880
Speaker 4:  I'm on the website, what that means is the server

799
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,600
Speaker 4:  has sent this information to

800
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,480
Speaker 4:  your browser and your browser has used that information and sort of

801
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:40,480
Speaker 4:  executed the files to build the thing that you're looking

802
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,120
Speaker 4:  at. Right? But that could have also included, they're like,

803
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:48,400
Speaker 4:  run this code, it'll make this fancy cool ad that with the

804
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,360
Speaker 4:  little guy who dances around, he's gonna love it. And like it made

805
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,760
Speaker 4:  a fancy cool ad with a guy who danced around and you did love it, but it

806
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,960
Speaker 4:  also installed this malware, which is now like

807
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:03,390
Speaker 4:  encrypting your entire computer and gonna ransomware you or just

808
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:07,350
Speaker 4:  like hang out there for six months and gradually sort of expand its

809
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:10,550
Speaker 4:  access in the network. I mean I think the, the tricky thing is once

810
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:14,790
Speaker 4:  the perimeter has been breached, it's kind of like, well,

811
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:18,070
Speaker 4:  what mischief do they want to do? One, they're on the inside. It's like,

812
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:21,990
Speaker 4:  I, I don't know. I hope nothing too bad, but like it's out of my

813
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:22,630
Speaker 4:  control now.

814
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:25,670
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I I spent a lot of time in prepping for this, talking to people and

815
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:29,150
Speaker 3:  reading about exploit kits. Oh yeah. It's just my god. Terrifying.

816
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:32,030
Speaker 3:  And basically it's, it's exactly what you're talking about. The idea is like

817
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:35,590
Speaker 3:  you, you load this website and what it does is it installs software on your

818
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:38,990
Speaker 3:  computer that essentially just looks for vulnerabilities, right? And it says

819
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:42,750
Speaker 3:  like, you know, do you have this technology to play

820
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:46,590
Speaker 3:  videos in your browser? No. Do you have this one to read PDFs in your browser?

821
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,110
Speaker 3:  Ah, you do. I'm gonna use that and just sort of open up a little hole in

822
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:53,590
Speaker 3:  it and then download whatever I feel like it's like,

823
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:57,510
Speaker 3:  and it's, it's, it's just once it's in it, it does sort of all this different

824
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:00,750
Speaker 3:  hunting, it finds its place and then it can just sit there and it can wait

825
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:04,710
Speaker 3:  as long as it needs to and then it just has access to your computer. And

826
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:08,350
Speaker 3:  this stuff is like, it, it's dormant forever. It's tiny, it's hard to find

827
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:12,310
Speaker 3:  and it just sits there sort of waiting to be activated. And it's gotten really

828
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:15,590
Speaker 3:  sophisticated to the point where like, like flash, if I'm remembering this

829
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:18,550
Speaker 3:  right, used to be like the main problem here, right? And it was like flash

830
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:20,070
Speaker 3:  was a garbage piece of software.

831
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:20,630
Speaker 4:  It was a very big

832
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:24,550
Speaker 3:  Problem that had full of loopholes and exploits and every

833
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,870
Speaker 3:  time you would load a flash thing it was loading a, an app from your computer

834
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:31,800
Speaker 3:  and running it. And by doing so they could put code in it and then

835
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,960
Speaker 3:  load other stuff. But there are still a bunch of ways like that into your

836
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:35,520
Speaker 3:  computer now.

837
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:39,640
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I would say, I mean the other thing that classically people were worried

838
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,160
Speaker 4:  about, and this is something that, you know, in the time I've been working

839
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:47,040
Speaker 4:  at the Verge https adoption, including by the verge.com,

840
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:51,160
Speaker 4:  has just gone from sort of zero to 60. Yeah. Like it was, it was maybe

841
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,960
Speaker 4:  a third of websites in 20 I it was, it was definitely below

842
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,120
Speaker 4:  half and now we're well over 95%. It's sort of rare that you go somewhere

843
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:02,040
Speaker 4:  on the internet that doesn't have it. The result of that is these

844
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,920
Speaker 4:  injection attacks where someone is at the I S P or at the router or

845
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:09,960
Speaker 4:  at sort of tapping into some cable because they're the NSA

846
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:14,160
Speaker 4:  and they want to, you're sort of opening a legitimate

847
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,040
Speaker 4:  website, but they are injecting malware into it as sort of turning

848
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,920
Speaker 4:  it into a malicious website. You know, those are still

849
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,480
Speaker 4:  possible, but they're much harder to do. And so

850
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,920
Speaker 4:  seems to me in many ways things have gotten better. But it still is the

851
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,720
Speaker 4:  case that you should not like clicking the problem

852
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:37,680
Speaker 4:  is clicking the link to the website. Right. Not like once I'm on the

853
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,920
Speaker 4:  website, what do I do? Yeah.

854
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:43,960
Speaker 3:  But we should say, and I think I, I think not to like downplay any of this

855
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,480
Speaker 3:  stuff, but I feel like it, it continues to be a useful thing to remind people

856
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,840
Speaker 3:  that like most people get into trouble because they enter

857
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:53,200
Speaker 3:  information in places that they shouldn't. And this is like what you were

858
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,400
Speaker 3:  talking about earlier about like, don't give your credit card over the phone

859
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,920
Speaker 3:  and this like basic stuff. But like anytime you're gonna type in your username

860
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,520
Speaker 3:  and password, anytime you're gonna click on a link in your email, anytime

861
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,280
Speaker 3:  you're gonna type in your social security number or your home address or

862
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,520
Speaker 3:  whatever, like most people get into trouble because they give up information

863
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,200
Speaker 3:  willingly to people. They shouldn't. Like the malware stuff is real, the

864
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,680
Speaker 3:  exploit kit stuff is real. The stuff they can download is real. But like

865
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,400
Speaker 3:  you are much more likely to get in trouble by reading your credit card number

866
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,320
Speaker 3:  to someone you shouldn't than by like having your routers tapped by the nsa.

867
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:26,000
Speaker 4:  Well and also I think I, I mean even more immediately, the thing

868
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,640
Speaker 4:  right now that people are most likely to get taken by is

869
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:33,280
Speaker 4:  someone calling you on the phone and telling you they're from Texas.

870
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:34,240
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

871
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:37,640
Speaker 4:  And it's like Microsoft will not call you on the phone

872
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:42,320
Speaker 4:  to, because there's a problem with your office installation that will not

873
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:46,240
Speaker 4:  happen. They, they, they have email, they're good

874
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,240
Speaker 4:  at it. They know a lot about email. They'll send you an email and

875
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,080
Speaker 3:  Mostly they're avoiding you. They don't want to call you, they don't want

876
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:55,360
Speaker 3:  you to call them. Like if, if you ever get a customer support person who's

877
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,400
Speaker 3:  like desperate to talk to you, that should set off all your alarm bells because

878
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,920
Speaker 3:  that is not a thing that happens in real life. I'm just

879
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:01,680
Speaker 4:  Saying. Absolutely.

880
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:06,800
Speaker 3:  I like it. Alright. Any, any other like common sense security stuff we should

881
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,480
Speaker 3:  tell people? I feel like the advice we always give is like two factor authentication

882
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,400
Speaker 3:  is good. Do that.

883
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:14,640
Speaker 4:  Yeah, absolutely. I would say, yeah. I mean, work on

884
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,520
Speaker 4:  knife skills. Knife skills are always useful. That's more of a physical

885
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,040
Speaker 4:  security thing, but I tell everyone, you know, practice with a knife,

886
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,240
Speaker 3:  Online knife skills, couple a week.

887
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:23,480
Speaker 4:  Yep.

888
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:27,520
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I like it. All right, we should go. Russell. Thank you.

889
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,040
Speaker 3:  This has been very fun and enlightening and if anybody ever wants to talk

890
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,640
Speaker 3:  for many, many hours about pseudo random number generators, I now have all

891
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,360
Speaker 3:  of this information in my head and nothing to do with it. I know which ones

892
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,640
Speaker 3:  are good. I know which ones are bad. I have a lot of thoughts, but anyway,

893
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,920
Speaker 3:  follow all of us on Twitter. There's a ton more good cybersecurity stuff

894
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:48,560
Speaker 3:  we've done at the Verge the last couple of weeks and always because it is

895
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:52,120
Speaker 3:  always cybersecurity week on the verge.com. Russell is Russell

896
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:55,800
Speaker 3:  Brando on Twitter. Ne Eli is reckless on Twitter. I'm pierce on Twitter.

897
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,800
Speaker 3:  Thank you for listening. This is the Verge Cast. We will be back on Wednesday

898
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,480
Speaker 3:  and Friday with our regularly scheduled programming. We will see you then.

899
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,040
Speaker 3:  Rock and roll

900
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,110
Speaker 1:  Support for this episode comes from Zelle. You'd never

901
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:27,070
Speaker 1:  fall for an online scam, right? You use

902
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:30,670
Speaker 1:  two factor authentication. Ignore calls from everyone named

903
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:33,950
Speaker 1:  spam risk and never use the password.

904
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:35,190
Speaker 1:  Password.

905
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:40,430
Speaker 1:  But scammers are getting more sophisticated and more active,

906
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:44,350
Speaker 1:  which means they're finding millions of new victims every single

907
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:48,270
Speaker 1:  year. The good news is that there's a lot you can do to protect

908
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:51,910
Speaker 1:  yourself on the Wild, wild Web. For starters,

909
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:55,790
Speaker 1:  Zelle wants to remind you only send money to people you know

910
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:59,830
Speaker 1:  and trust. Zelle is available to United States Bank account holders.

911
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:01,510
Speaker 1:  Only terms and conditions apply.
