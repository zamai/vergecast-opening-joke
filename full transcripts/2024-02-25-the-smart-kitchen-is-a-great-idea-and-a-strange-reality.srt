Description: Over the next two Sundays on The Vergecast, The Verge’s Jennifer Pattison-Tuohy and David Pierce dig into the dream smart kitchen, the less-than-dreamy reality of the situation, and what it might take to make cooking, cleaning, meal-prepping, and eating more efficient and more fun.
On this episode, Jen takes us on a tour of her own smart(ish) kitchen, and explains why the kitchen often feels left behind in the overall smart home race. Then, Jen and David are joined by Ben Harris, the CEO of Fresco; and Nick Holzherr, the co-founder of Samsung Food. They tell us about the opportunities and challenges in reinventing the way we cook and eat, and explain why the AI revolution might usher in huge change.

00:00:37,595 --> 00:00:41,325
Speaker 4:  Welcome To. The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Automated

3
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:45,365
Speaker 4:  Pancake Flippers. I'm your friend, David Pierce, and this is the first

4
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:49,325
Speaker 4:  episode in our two episode miniseries all about the smart home. And

5
00:00:49,485 --> 00:00:52,165
Speaker 4:  actually, we're even more focused than the smart home. We're just talking

6
00:00:52,255 --> 00:00:56,245
Speaker 4:  smart kitchens. So for the next two Sundays, we're gonna get deep in the

7
00:00:56,255 --> 00:01:00,165
Speaker 4:  weeds and in our feelings about smart kitchens and Jen Patterson Tui is

8
00:01:00,165 --> 00:01:03,085
Speaker 4:  the only person I could imagine doing this with. Jen, thank you for being

9
00:01:03,085 --> 00:01:03,285
Speaker 4:  here.

10
00:01:03,695 --> 00:01:07,605
Speaker 3:  Thank you David. I'm so excited about this. I am a smart kitchen fanatic,

11
00:01:08,165 --> 00:01:12,005
Speaker 3:  a frustrated, smart kitchen fanatic. So I'm really excited to

12
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,325
Speaker 3:  dive into this. The, the

13
00:01:13,685 --> 00:01:17,605
Speaker 4:  Frustrated part is kind of why we both really wanted to do it.

14
00:01:17,605 --> 00:01:20,365
Speaker 4:  Talking about the smart home, like our only rule coming into this series

15
00:01:20,425 --> 00:01:23,365
Speaker 4:  was we can't make a series about matter. That was the only thing I believed

16
00:01:23,665 --> 00:01:24,285
Speaker 4:  in my soul.

17
00:01:26,525 --> 00:01:30,325
Speaker 3:  I was like, come on, David Matter. It's obvious. He's like, no,

18
00:01:30,745 --> 00:01:34,405
Speaker 3:  but don't worry listener. We will talk about matter.

19
00:01:35,225 --> 00:01:38,925
Speaker 4:  We are overdue for our quarterly is matter ever going to actually fix

20
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:42,565
Speaker 4:  everything conversation. So, we'll, we'll do that at some point. But you've

21
00:01:42,565 --> 00:01:46,485
Speaker 4:  been covering the Smart Kitchen kind of as a concept for a long

22
00:01:46,485 --> 00:01:49,965
Speaker 4:  time and you were, were were just taking notes, getting ready for this, and

23
00:01:49,965 --> 00:01:53,205
Speaker 4:  you were like, here's some stuff I wrote 10 years ago about why the Smart

24
00:01:53,205 --> 00:01:56,805
Speaker 4:  Kitchen was gonna be great. And I was struck reading it by how

25
00:01:56,865 --> 00:02:00,565
Speaker 4:  little has changed, but also how sort of clear the vision

26
00:02:00,665 --> 00:02:04,365
Speaker 4:  is for what we want this thing to be. So, I guess, like,

27
00:02:04,675 --> 00:02:07,205
Speaker 4:  just to sort of set the scene for what we're gonna do in the next couple

28
00:02:07,205 --> 00:02:10,885
Speaker 4:  of episodes here, like when you think about what a smart kitchen

29
00:02:11,575 --> 00:02:15,125
Speaker 4:  could be, what, what is sort of the beautiful, perfect

30
00:02:15,225 --> 00:02:17,325
Speaker 4:  vision that you think of in your head?

31
00:02:17,985 --> 00:02:21,765
Speaker 3:  So. I. Just want my smart kitchen to

32
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:26,045
Speaker 3:  help me cook food. I mean it's a, it's a simple, it's a simple request.

33
00:02:26,405 --> 00:02:29,765
Speaker 3:  I want, the kitchen is a complicated, expensive

34
00:02:30,135 --> 00:02:34,125
Speaker 3:  space. you know, food waste, food management, cooking, lots

35
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:37,565
Speaker 3:  of meals. I have two kids and a husband and, and dogs that love

36
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:40,965
Speaker 3:  leftovers. So, you know, there's, there's a lot going on in the kitchen and

37
00:02:40,965 --> 00:02:44,125
Speaker 3:  it feels like it's such a ripe space for technology to just be like, okay,

38
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:48,005
Speaker 3:  here we are gonna help you. So the ideal smart kitchen for

39
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:51,965
Speaker 3:  me is one that knows what food I have can tell me what to

40
00:02:51,965 --> 00:02:55,045
Speaker 3:  cook. So I don't have to spend 20 minutes standing in front of the pantry

41
00:02:55,345 --> 00:02:59,005
Speaker 3:  or can most importantly alert me when I'm at the store.

42
00:02:59,315 --> 00:03:02,525
Speaker 3:  Okay, you're planning to cook chili tonight, but you don't have kidney beans.

43
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:05,725
Speaker 3:  Don't forget to buy them. You know, there's, there's so, but there's so many

44
00:03:05,725 --> 00:03:08,325
Speaker 3:  parts and pieces to the kitchen. There's the pantry, there's the cooking,

45
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:12,445
Speaker 3:  there's the fridge, your stove, your microwaves, your Therma mix, your

46
00:03:12,695 --> 00:03:15,605
Speaker 3:  blend. So, I mean, there's so many parts and pieces. And then the dishwasher,

47
00:03:15,745 --> 00:03:19,445
Speaker 3:  the cleanup, So, I just, I feel like there's such a huge

48
00:03:19,445 --> 00:03:23,245
Speaker 3:  potential in this space for technology to make it

49
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:27,005
Speaker 3:  easier but also better because the

50
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:30,925
Speaker 3:  default is, ugh, order pizza or ugh DoorDash.

51
00:03:31,555 --> 00:03:35,445
Speaker 3:  Whereas, you know, that shouldn't be my default. But often on a

52
00:03:35,445 --> 00:03:39,365
Speaker 3:  busy night I look at my fridge and I'm like, ah, no. But

53
00:03:39,365 --> 00:03:42,165
Speaker 3:  really if the fridge could say to me, okay, no, no, no, no, don't, don't

54
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:45,885
Speaker 3:  call dominoes here. Don't forget you've got kidney beans,

55
00:03:45,885 --> 00:03:49,365
Speaker 3:  you've got mince. Let's whip up a curry or a chili. But

56
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:53,845
Speaker 3:  then the one other thing that really is a struggle here is I want

57
00:03:53,845 --> 00:03:57,725
Speaker 3:  everything in my kitchen to work together. And this is where the

58
00:03:57,725 --> 00:04:01,445
Speaker 3:  smart home in general has had problems and the kitchen in particular even

59
00:04:01,445 --> 00:04:04,725
Speaker 3:  more problems because there's so many legacy manufacturers in this space.

60
00:04:05,105 --> 00:04:07,925
Speaker 3:  And then you have these sort of startups that have come in with like, oh

61
00:04:07,925 --> 00:04:10,885
Speaker 3:  look, we have this great device for you, but it doesn't work with anything

62
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:14,405
Speaker 3:  else and it's just a single device. Whereas the kitchen is a big space

63
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:18,485
Speaker 3:  with lots of technology already in it. So my ultimate smart kitchen

64
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:22,325
Speaker 3:  is one where everything communicates with everything else.

65
00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:26,165
Speaker 3:  My pantry talks to my fridge, my fridge talks to my oven. It sounds extreme.

66
00:04:26,385 --> 00:04:30,125
Speaker 3:  Why do I need my fridge talk to my oven? But ultimately it's should be a

67
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,445
Speaker 3:  simple process and make my life easier.

68
00:04:33,245 --> 00:04:36,125
Speaker 4:  I think that's right. The, the make my life easier thing is what I've really

69
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:39,205
Speaker 4:  come around to to, like I, I was making dinner last night thinking about,

70
00:04:39,205 --> 00:04:42,805
Speaker 4:  okay, what parts of this would I like to automate away?

71
00:04:42,985 --> 00:04:46,725
Speaker 4:  And the part where I'm like cutting carrots is like whatever, I, I don't

72
00:04:46,725 --> 00:04:50,245
Speaker 4:  really mind cutting carrots and If you. They're, they make like things that

73
00:04:50,245 --> 00:04:53,845
Speaker 4:  make cutting easier. Right? But the thing where I have to remember when to

74
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:57,845
Speaker 4:  preheat the oven and always forget to do it for too long, so I'm doing it

75
00:04:57,845 --> 00:05:00,645
Speaker 4:  too late and then I'm standing around waiting for the oven to preheat. Like

76
00:05:00,805 --> 00:05:04,765
Speaker 4:  I would just like it if the kind of balancing act that is being

77
00:05:04,765 --> 00:05:08,725
Speaker 4:  in the kitchen all the time, were just a little better that it was like,

78
00:05:08,745 --> 00:05:12,485
Speaker 4:  oh he started preheating the oven. I'm gonna start also preheating the air

79
00:05:12,485 --> 00:05:15,085
Speaker 4:  fryer because I know what David's about to cook and it's gonna go in there

80
00:05:15,085 --> 00:05:18,725
Speaker 4:  in 10 minutes. I made air fryer broccoli last night, by the way, for the

81
00:05:18,725 --> 00:05:22,525
Speaker 4:  first time Ooh fantastic, easiest thing I've ever made and probably the

82
00:05:22,525 --> 00:05:26,405
Speaker 4:  tastiest broccoli I've ever cooked. So that was cool. End upsetting

83
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:29,485
Speaker 4:  all at the same time. but it just feels like there's so many of these like

84
00:05:29,485 --> 00:05:33,405
Speaker 4:  little tiny decisions you make in the kitchen all of the time. And I feel

85
00:05:33,405 --> 00:05:36,245
Speaker 4:  like when we talk about the smart kitchen, we talk about, I always think

86
00:05:36,245 --> 00:05:39,205
Speaker 4:  about the scene and beauty and the beast where the dishes are making dinner.

87
00:05:40,165 --> 00:05:43,445
Speaker 4:  Like that's a version of the smart home that people talk about that I actually

88
00:05:43,445 --> 00:05:46,165
Speaker 4:  don't really want. Right. Where you just kind of sit at the table and your

89
00:05:46,165 --> 00:05:47,645
Speaker 4:  kitchen cooks dinner for you. Yeah.

90
00:05:48,245 --> 00:05:51,085
Speaker 3:  I mean I, I would like that but, but I feel like that's, that is, I

91
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:51,685
Speaker 4:  Guess that's fair. I would like that occasion

92
00:05:51,715 --> 00:05:55,685
Speaker 3:  Perhaps pie in the sky. Right. We may be a ways away from that.

93
00:05:55,965 --> 00:05:59,925
Speaker 4:  Yeah, that's, that's like, like a pipe dream at best I think. But the idea

94
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:03,765
Speaker 4:  that I could just sort of do the things that are interesting

95
00:06:03,765 --> 00:06:07,525
Speaker 4:  and useful and valuable and kind of my appliances know

96
00:06:07,675 --> 00:06:11,645
Speaker 4:  what I need from them in that process. Yes. That feels like

97
00:06:11,645 --> 00:06:13,925
Speaker 4:  it should be attainable. And I feel like as we talk about smart home stuff

98
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:17,685
Speaker 4:  in general, that is like the level we have to get to that with

99
00:06:17,705 --> 00:06:19,685
Speaker 4:  so many things we're just not quite at yet.

100
00:06:19,995 --> 00:06:22,725
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I mean 'cause ultimately you could see, you know, one of the problems

101
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:26,245
Speaker 3:  with cooking is not nothing ever comes out at the same time. This is where

102
00:06:26,245 --> 00:06:29,445
Speaker 3:  DoorDash is great 'cause everything's ready at once, but you know, you've

103
00:06:29,445 --> 00:06:32,885
Speaker 3:  made mashed potato but the sausages are still an hour later and then you're

104
00:06:32,885 --> 00:06:36,165
Speaker 3:  gonna have cold mashed potatoes or you have to stick 'em in the microwave

105
00:06:36,165 --> 00:06:39,405
Speaker 3:  and it's like a juggling act and it feels like technology could really help

106
00:06:39,405 --> 00:06:42,525
Speaker 3:  bring everything, you know, a great streamline

107
00:06:43,205 --> 00:06:47,125
Speaker 3:  timeline and you know, you preheat the oven, the overhead fan

108
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:50,645
Speaker 3:  should come on automatically. I mean there's just so many small parts that

109
00:06:50,645 --> 00:06:54,285
Speaker 3:  it feels like could all come together to just make the process easier and

110
00:06:54,315 --> 00:06:58,165
Speaker 3:  also make us better chefs. Yeah. Like the air fry

111
00:06:58,165 --> 00:07:01,285
Speaker 3:  for example is obviously a huge revolution in the kitchen and though it's

112
00:07:01,285 --> 00:07:03,085
Speaker 3:  basically a convection oven, but you know,

113
00:07:03,985 --> 00:07:05,485
Speaker 4:  But a small one, it's so fast. That's

114
00:07:05,485 --> 00:07:09,005
Speaker 3:  Another story. Yeah. But yeah, technology can make us

115
00:07:09,265 --> 00:07:13,125
Speaker 3:  better chefs, better cooks do better in the kitchen. That's where we're at

116
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:17,085
Speaker 3:  now. Perhaps eventually we'll have the kitchen that actually can

117
00:07:17,085 --> 00:07:21,005
Speaker 3:  cook for us one day Beyond the Microwave, which already does a

118
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:22,645
Speaker 3:  pretty good job of that for, for you. True.

119
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:26,005
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So you, you want the Beauty in the Beast kitchen? I mean I really,

120
00:07:26,085 --> 00:07:28,965
Speaker 4:  I kind of do too. Like I guess I'm, I'm sort of lying to myself. It would

121
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:30,805
Speaker 4:  be great to have every once in a while.

122
00:07:31,635 --> 00:07:35,365
Speaker 3:  Well, or the robot that you just say go, go cook, go cook my dinner

123
00:07:35,465 --> 00:07:38,405
Speaker 3:  for me and it goes into the kitchen and gets everything for you.

124
00:07:39,265 --> 00:07:39,485
Speaker 3:  but

125
00:07:39,505 --> 00:07:40,405
Speaker 4:  It would be kind of nice.

126
00:07:40,405 --> 00:07:44,325
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I mean, you know, the Roy the robot dream, but yeah, I ultimately though

127
00:07:44,325 --> 00:07:48,045
Speaker 3:  cooking is fun, right? A lot of people enjoy cooking. I I

128
00:07:48,325 --> 00:07:51,605
Speaker 3:  am a huge home chef. I, I have a, you know, for my

129
00:07:52,115 --> 00:07:56,005
Speaker 3:  last large birthday rather than, you know, get the sports car. My

130
00:07:56,005 --> 00:07:57,565
Speaker 3:  midlife crisis was a brand new kitchen.

131
00:07:58,285 --> 00:07:58,845
Speaker 4:  I love that.

132
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:02,645
Speaker 3:  I know. And I wanted to make it smart. I was like, I mean I'm a smart home

133
00:08:02,645 --> 00:08:06,045
Speaker 3:  reviewer. I should have a smart kitchen and it was surprisingly hard.

134
00:08:06,995 --> 00:08:09,285
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So actually one of the things I was gonna ask you at the beginning

135
00:08:09,285 --> 00:08:12,725
Speaker 4:  is like walk me through your setup because I think one of the things you

136
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:16,125
Speaker 4:  and I talk a lot about is how these things are getting sort of incrementally

137
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,565
Speaker 4:  better over time. And I think lights are sort of a fun example, right? Like

138
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,125
Speaker 4:  10 years ago it was like, oh you can turn on your lights and now you can

139
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:25,845
Speaker 4:  do some sort of interesting sophisticated stuff with the lighting in your

140
00:08:25,845 --> 00:08:29,485
Speaker 4:  house. I think it's still relatively low stakes in the scheme of things like

141
00:08:29,485 --> 00:08:32,325
Speaker 4:  when lights come on. But the idea that like I can sync up my lights to my

142
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:35,005
Speaker 4:  television so that what I'm watching affects the lighting in the room. Like

143
00:08:35,005 --> 00:08:38,485
Speaker 4:  that's objectively like cool and pretend sort of bigger, more interesting

144
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:42,405
Speaker 4:  things over time. It feels to me like the Smart Kitchen is still sort

145
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:45,925
Speaker 4:  of a collection of individually smart things, but nothing

146
00:08:46,305 --> 00:08:49,285
Speaker 4:  bigger than that. But I'm curious like you got to go through this actual

147
00:08:49,285 --> 00:08:52,565
Speaker 4:  process as a person who does this for a living. Like paint us a picture of

148
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:53,845
Speaker 4:  of Jen's Smart Kitchen.

149
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:58,965
Speaker 3:  Yeah, so it's still very much individually smart gadgets and that's, you

150
00:08:58,965 --> 00:09:02,485
Speaker 3:  know, that's kind of been the way the kitchen has has been, and I've said

151
00:09:02,485 --> 00:09:06,045
Speaker 3:  this before but the, the kitchen is already the most technologically advanced

152
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,965
Speaker 3:  space in our home. So we've already got, you know, a robot that washes our

153
00:09:09,965 --> 00:09:13,765
Speaker 3:  dishes. We've got, you know, a box that keeps our food fresh.

154
00:09:14,045 --> 00:09:18,005
Speaker 3:  We've got an oven that can do a lot of really cool things. But one

155
00:09:18,005 --> 00:09:21,965
Speaker 3:  of the problems I come across in the kitchen, and this is part of what I'm

156
00:09:21,965 --> 00:09:25,565
Speaker 3:  gonna be experimenting over this next couple of episodes, is that

157
00:09:25,735 --> 00:09:28,965
Speaker 3:  smart kitchen gadgets and just regular kitchen gadgets are really complicated.

158
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:33,045
Speaker 3:  They have so many functions like a microwave can do

159
00:09:33,045 --> 00:09:36,685
Speaker 3:  some amazing things, but most people just hit that extra 32nd button

160
00:09:36,865 --> 00:09:40,725
Speaker 3:  and come out with, you know, hot coffee or popcorn. We

161
00:09:40,725 --> 00:09:44,285
Speaker 3:  don't take advantage of the technology we already have in the kitchen

162
00:09:44,545 --> 00:09:48,445
Speaker 3:  and this is where apps and AI and the smart

163
00:09:48,445 --> 00:09:52,285
Speaker 3:  kitchen could be so much more useful. Like actually helping us

164
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:56,205
Speaker 3:  use our appliances better. It is a lot easier to

165
00:09:56,665 --> 00:10:00,525
Speaker 3:  use a smart, my Smart Oven for example, the features

166
00:10:00,525 --> 00:10:03,645
Speaker 3:  on it, it's easier to program with an app than it is to use the tiny little

167
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,965
Speaker 3:  screen. And I have to answer your question, So I have it Thermador Oven,

168
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:10,765
Speaker 3:  which is owned by, what was it? It's Bosch. It's Bosch and

169
00:10:10,765 --> 00:10:14,725
Speaker 3:  Thermador are kind of sister companies and then a Thermador dishwasher

170
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:18,805
Speaker 3:  and they're both smart using the Home Connect Appliance app,

171
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:23,125
Speaker 3:  which is Bosch's Home Smart Home app. And I, I was

172
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:26,765
Speaker 3:  able to connect it to voice assistance and I can start it remotely,

173
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:30,965
Speaker 3:  but there are all sorts of caveats. Like I have to turn a certain

174
00:10:31,155 --> 00:10:35,085
Speaker 3:  knob on the oven in order to be able to access it remotely,

175
00:10:35,095 --> 00:10:38,965
Speaker 3:  which half the time I've forgotten to do. So those types of

176
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:42,445
Speaker 3:  frustration, like small, I think it's a, it's the safety feature and I get

177
00:10:42,445 --> 00:10:46,205
Speaker 3:  it. But those two appliances I got about

178
00:10:46,325 --> 00:10:49,805
Speaker 3:  two years ago and I've really only just started to figure out the benefits

179
00:10:49,925 --> 00:10:53,885
Speaker 3:  I can use from them from a, from a connected angle. My favorite

180
00:10:53,885 --> 00:10:57,765
Speaker 3:  thing in my Smart Kitchen is a gadget that is siloed in its

181
00:10:57,765 --> 00:11:00,605
Speaker 3:  own little ecosystem and that's the Therma Mix which we have talked about

182
00:11:00,605 --> 00:11:04,325
Speaker 3:  before. Yeah. Which is the blender that can cook

183
00:11:04,785 --> 00:11:08,525
Speaker 3:  and it is an amazing device but it

184
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:11,765
Speaker 3:  doesn't work with anything else. So I just have to do everything in this

185
00:11:11,765 --> 00:11:15,525
Speaker 3:  little, little pot. And then other parts of my Smart kitchen are

186
00:11:15,545 --> 00:11:19,365
Speaker 3:  my smart fridge. So I've actually had this Samsung Smart Fridge for a while.

187
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:23,005
Speaker 3:  It's one of the older models, but one of the nice things about the smart

188
00:11:23,005 --> 00:11:26,725
Speaker 3:  fridges is that they get all the same updates. So even if I went and bought

189
00:11:26,725 --> 00:11:30,205
Speaker 3:  a new fridge today, the capabilities are comparable, which is nice.

190
00:11:30,915 --> 00:11:34,885
Speaker 3:  Samsung's done a good job there keeping the software up to date. but it is

191
00:11:34,885 --> 00:11:38,285
Speaker 3:  still a giant Android touch touchscreen that's about five years old. So it's

192
00:11:38,285 --> 00:11:39,405
Speaker 3:  a bit laggy.

193
00:11:41,065 --> 00:11:44,805
Speaker 3:  And then I have a smart faucet, which I love and that's voice

194
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:48,765
Speaker 3:  controlled and that's again, that's Moen and again it's in its own

195
00:11:48,765 --> 00:11:49,565
Speaker 3:  little ecosystem.

196
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:53,005
Speaker 4:  I need you to explain to me why you would wanna voice control your faucet.

197
00:11:53,225 --> 00:11:55,405
Speaker 4:  I'm not convinced that's a real thing anyone ever does.

198
00:11:57,435 --> 00:12:01,365
Speaker 3:  Okay. Two reasons. First, it, it does have a sensor so you

199
00:12:01,365 --> 00:12:04,845
Speaker 3:  can just swipe on and off and that's the most useful because you know your

200
00:12:04,845 --> 00:12:08,765
Speaker 3:  hands are greasy and, but you can say to your assistant,

201
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:12,885
Speaker 3:  I need three cups of hot water or

202
00:12:12,955 --> 00:12:16,765
Speaker 3:  give it a specific temperature and it will dispense precisely three

203
00:12:16,835 --> 00:12:20,485
Speaker 3:  cups at 50 degrees or 80 degrees whatever's hot water.

204
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:24,725
Speaker 3:  Okay. you know, and, and so I'm beyond this stage, but for example, If, you

205
00:12:24,725 --> 00:12:28,365
Speaker 3:  have a baby and you're filling a baby bottle, you can have it dispense

206
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:32,045
Speaker 3:  exactly the type, the right type of water, exactly the right amount. And

207
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:35,325
Speaker 3:  you know when you go and put your teaspoon to get your teaspoon of water

208
00:12:35,325 --> 00:12:38,565
Speaker 3:  and it all splashes in your face. Instead you can just have a little pot

209
00:12:38,585 --> 00:12:42,165
Speaker 3:  and say dispense a teaspoon of water. So yes, it's a bit

210
00:12:42,165 --> 00:12:46,005
Speaker 3:  gimmicky. I don't use it daily but there are times when I find that helpful.

211
00:12:46,145 --> 00:12:49,605
Speaker 3:  And also, you know, if I'm cooking and I have a big pot and I can be like,

212
00:12:49,945 --> 00:12:53,525
Speaker 3:  hey moan, start the hot water and I'll come over and I can put the pot in

213
00:12:53,525 --> 00:12:57,445
Speaker 3:  the dish in the sink and it's already warm and ready to wash. So, but yes,

214
00:12:57,505 --> 00:13:01,445
Speaker 3:  as we've said that right now, functionality is a little, it's

215
00:13:01,445 --> 00:13:05,045
Speaker 3:  like we stick wifi chips in things and then we figure out down the road

216
00:13:05,635 --> 00:13:09,445
Speaker 3:  whether there's something good that we can do here. And I feel like

217
00:13:09,445 --> 00:13:13,325
Speaker 3:  we're at that stage right now where figurine out how all of these devices

218
00:13:13,545 --> 00:13:17,285
Speaker 3:  can work well efficiently in our kitchen is is where we should be.

219
00:13:17,305 --> 00:13:20,685
Speaker 3:  That's what I'm hoping to kind of find some solutions to over these next

220
00:13:20,685 --> 00:13:21,245
Speaker 3:  two episodes.

221
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:24,285
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it it is really interesting. I think that the fact that the Thermo

222
00:13:24,285 --> 00:13:28,165
Speaker 4:  mix is so useful to you and so many other people, like

223
00:13:28,165 --> 00:13:31,645
Speaker 4:  people love the Thermomix, I feel like it is nearing like the

224
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:35,325
Speaker 4:  KitchenAid territory of just like people who buy one then sort of

225
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:38,845
Speaker 4:  obsessively talk about how much they love it. Yeah. And as somebody who relatively

226
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,725
Speaker 4:  recently actually went and finally bought a KitchenAid and a bunch of attachments,

227
00:13:41,725 --> 00:13:45,165
Speaker 4:  like I get it now. I am one of those people. But I think the fact that the

228
00:13:45,165 --> 00:13:48,805
Speaker 4:  thermo mix and things like the Instant Pot even like need to exist

229
00:13:49,225 --> 00:13:51,965
Speaker 4:  is, is sort of telling on the smart home because the only way we've been

230
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:55,925
Speaker 4:  able to figure this out is to just shove as many things as we can

231
00:13:56,315 --> 00:14:00,285
Speaker 4:  into a single gadget. They're like the the smartphone of the smart home,

232
00:14:00,285 --> 00:14:02,565
Speaker 4:  right? Where it's just like, it just does all the stuff, it doesn't do any

233
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:05,805
Speaker 4:  of it as well, but it's all right there and that makes it useful,

234
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:06,445
Speaker 3:  Convenient,

235
00:14:06,855 --> 00:14:10,365
Speaker 4:  Right? You can, you can control it in one app, you know where it is like

236
00:14:10,365 --> 00:14:12,845
Speaker 4:  it's it You don, it doesn't have to learn how to talk to other stuff because

237
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:16,325
Speaker 4:  it's right there. But that for a bunch of just

238
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:20,325
Speaker 4:  practical reasons like can't be The future, right? Like the idea that

239
00:14:20,325 --> 00:14:24,045
Speaker 4:  you're going to have one single Appliance that does everything and that's

240
00:14:24,045 --> 00:14:27,405
Speaker 4:  how we solve the smart kitchen is just, that's just not it. No,

241
00:14:28,025 --> 00:14:31,125
Speaker 4:  not least because it would require you to yet again like rip and replace

242
00:14:31,175 --> 00:14:34,605
Speaker 4:  every single thing in your kitchen to make this work. But So I think we're

243
00:14:34,605 --> 00:14:37,485
Speaker 4:  kind of in the, in the smartphone phase of the Smart kitchen where it's like

244
00:14:37,485 --> 00:14:40,605
Speaker 4:  what, how can we put all of this stuff into one gadget and then the right

245
00:14:40,605 --> 00:14:43,885
Speaker 4:  answer is like let's blow it all up back into sort of its original pieces

246
00:14:43,985 --> 00:14:45,525
Speaker 4:  but make them all make more sense together.

247
00:14:45,675 --> 00:14:49,325
Speaker 3:  Exactly. Yes. They all need to work together and that, and I think that starts

248
00:14:49,325 --> 00:14:52,725
Speaker 3:  with the core really is the, is the fridge and you know,

249
00:14:52,995 --> 00:14:56,205
Speaker 3:  Samsung and its smarts Fridge has has been mocked,

250
00:14:56,565 --> 00:15:00,525
Speaker 3:  rightly true over the years but ultimately and in

251
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,445
Speaker 3:  that article that you were referencing that I wrote like 10 years ago, there

252
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:07,205
Speaker 3:  was some really good ideas about food management. And food management really

253
00:15:07,205 --> 00:15:11,085
Speaker 3:  is the core sort of piece that you need to make the Smart kitchen

254
00:15:11,115 --> 00:15:14,405
Speaker 3:  work. It's great to have all these appliances but If you don't have anything

255
00:15:14,405 --> 00:15:18,325
Speaker 3:  to cook, you're not going to do much with them. So you know a fridge that

256
00:15:18,325 --> 00:15:22,245
Speaker 3:  can know what it has in it, know when you are low on

257
00:15:22,765 --> 00:15:26,605
Speaker 3:  supplies, know what you need for say the meal plan you've made

258
00:15:26,605 --> 00:15:30,565
Speaker 3:  for the week and also tie in with your pantry. I know Amazon at some point

259
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:34,325
Speaker 3:  had like a, a shelf you could put in your pantry that would weigh your

260
00:15:34,325 --> 00:15:37,485
Speaker 3:  ingredients and give you an idea of what you needed to buy.

261
00:15:37,965 --> 00:15:41,805
Speaker 3:  RFID tags are a really interesting idea in this space. But

262
00:15:41,845 --> 00:15:45,245
Speaker 3:  I feel like maybe a lot of the ideas we had 10 years ago

263
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:49,805
Speaker 3:  for the Smart Kitchen, there are so many developments in technology that

264
00:15:49,805 --> 00:15:53,765
Speaker 3:  have come along that could supersede those and really bring us to that next

265
00:15:53,765 --> 00:15:57,725
Speaker 3:  level. And AI is obviously one portion where I feel

266
00:15:57,725 --> 00:16:01,645
Speaker 3:  like there's gonna be a huge step forward now in in the Smart

267
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:05,445
Speaker 3:  Kitchen now that we have that type of capability. And then one of the other

268
00:16:05,445 --> 00:16:09,245
Speaker 3:  areas that I've really struggled with in terms of understanding

269
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:13,605
Speaker 3:  the benefit of the smart kitchen is the wifi connectivity. I think a lot

270
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:17,405
Speaker 3:  of people really just don't like the idea of all their appliances

271
00:16:17,405 --> 00:16:20,045
Speaker 3:  being online and all their appliances talking to their

272
00:16:20,835 --> 00:16:24,765
Speaker 3:  manufacturers. You know, Samsung knows every time I've opened my fridge

273
00:16:26,065 --> 00:16:30,045
Speaker 3:  and so there's a privacy issue I think also that is worth sort

274
00:16:30,045 --> 00:16:33,965
Speaker 3:  of considering when you are jumping into the smart kitchen. But on the flip

275
00:16:33,965 --> 00:16:36,845
Speaker 3:  side, and I know we are not necessarily gonna go into this in a lot of detail

276
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:40,365
Speaker 3:  but it's an area I'm really interested in is energy management. When you

277
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:44,165
Speaker 3:  connect your kitchen, many of the devices in your kitchen

278
00:16:44,265 --> 00:16:48,165
Speaker 3:  are using energy constantly. And if we can, if we can sort of

279
00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:52,005
Speaker 3:  harness that power and end up helping save energy

280
00:16:52,265 --> 00:16:56,205
Speaker 3:  in our kitchens, that gives you a really good reason right there to start

281
00:16:56,205 --> 00:16:57,125
Speaker 3:  with the smart kitchen I think.

282
00:16:57,515 --> 00:17:01,245
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think that's right And that's a perfect segue to the next thing we're

283
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:04,325
Speaker 4:  gonna do On this episode, which is talk to some folks who are trying to build

284
00:17:04,345 --> 00:17:07,805
Speaker 4:  all of this stuff. But first we need to take a very quick break. We'll be

285
00:17:07,805 --> 00:17:08,045
Speaker 4:  right back.

286
00:17:13,555 --> 00:17:17,255
Speaker 5:  Fox Creative, this is advertiser content from

287
00:17:17,255 --> 00:17:17,575
Speaker 5:  Kohler.

288
00:17:18,855 --> 00:17:21,935
Speaker 6:  I think when we think of design we're like beautiful poster

289
00:17:23,095 --> 00:17:26,695
Speaker 6:  gorgeous graphics, but I also think design has like

290
00:17:27,735 --> 00:17:31,575
Speaker 6:  a place in making sure that people feel the best that they can

291
00:17:31,575 --> 00:17:35,375
Speaker 6:  be. Hi, I'm Laura Derado. I'm a group

292
00:17:35,575 --> 00:17:39,495
Speaker 6:  creative director of Box Creative. During my nine to five and my five

293
00:17:39,515 --> 00:17:42,535
Speaker 6:  to nine, I've always got good design on the brain.

294
00:17:44,005 --> 00:17:47,575
Speaker 6:  It's metaphorically and physically

295
00:17:47,605 --> 00:17:51,485
Speaker 6:  glowing. It's like the Aurora Borealis, which

296
00:17:51,485 --> 00:17:54,965
Speaker 6:  is exactly why I was so excited to meet the new me

297
00:17:54,965 --> 00:17:57,525
Speaker 6:  2.0 Kohler's smartest Toilet

298
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:02,245
Speaker 6:  on first introduction, it legit just

299
00:18:02,535 --> 00:18:06,205
Speaker 6:  waved a hand at me, not actual waved at him but the lid

300
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,405
Speaker 6:  moved up and greeted me for

301
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:13,445
Speaker 6:  the use. But right now we're in a showroom. So I can't actually use it.

302
00:18:14,565 --> 00:18:18,045
Speaker 6:  Functions like this. A hands-free greeting and form

303
00:18:18,645 --> 00:18:22,285
Speaker 6:  combined in the new me to elevate the everyday. It's a sculpture

304
00:18:22,395 --> 00:18:26,125
Speaker 6:  that begs for someone to like rest their

305
00:18:26,245 --> 00:18:30,045
Speaker 6:  body on it and walk away feeling really comfortable. A

306
00:18:30,045 --> 00:18:33,805
Speaker 6:  temperature controlled bidet, the heated seat, automatic self

307
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:37,725
Speaker 6:  cleaning cycles, access to smart home functions thanks to a

308
00:18:37,725 --> 00:18:41,485
Speaker 6:  built-in Alexa. The Numis got it all for everyone.

309
00:18:42,185 --> 00:18:46,085
Speaker 6:  The bottom has this really beautiful green glow and it's almost as

310
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:49,885
Speaker 6:  if they knew that was my special color because If, you go into my bathroom

311
00:18:49,905 --> 00:18:53,805
Speaker 6:  at home, the entire bathroom is a mint green.

312
00:18:54,355 --> 00:18:58,245
Speaker 6:  It's like the new, we knew that I was showing up. And what's really

313
00:18:58,245 --> 00:19:02,205
Speaker 6:  cool about this is that there is this like circular sphere metal

314
00:19:02,255 --> 00:19:06,085
Speaker 6:  piece that like allows for you to change the color on the bottom. So

315
00:19:06,085 --> 00:19:10,045
Speaker 6:  if I'm not in my mint green era, which I'm often am, I

316
00:19:10,045 --> 00:19:13,405
Speaker 6:  can be in another era, my like calming blue, my

317
00:19:13,915 --> 00:19:17,685
Speaker 6:  like rosy pink, like whatever I need to feel. It's,

318
00:19:18,235 --> 00:19:20,765
Speaker 6:  it's like the Sistine Chapel of Toilets

319
00:19:23,015 --> 00:19:26,685
Speaker 6:  experience a fully connected oasis of clean and comfort

320
00:19:26,835 --> 00:19:29,205
Speaker 6:  with the new Me 2.0. Learn

321
00:21:57,885 --> 00:22:01,105
Speaker 4:  All right, we're back. The next thing we're gonna do is talk to some of the

322
00:22:01,105 --> 00:22:05,025
Speaker 4:  folks who are trying to build this Jen You. You found these two folks

323
00:22:05,195 --> 00:22:08,945
Speaker 4:  we're about to talk to who I only discovered later, both have British accents,

324
00:22:09,155 --> 00:22:12,585
Speaker 4:  which I found very rude to do to just spring on me in the middle of an interview.

325
00:22:12,725 --> 00:22:12,945
Speaker 4:  The

326
00:22:12,945 --> 00:22:15,305
Speaker 3:  British invasion of The Vergecast. Yeah.

327
00:22:16,725 --> 00:22:20,225
Speaker 4:  Set up who these folks are and and what we're about to talk to 'em about.

328
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:21,385
Speaker 4:  Why'd you wanna have them on the show?

329
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:25,585
Speaker 3:  Yeah, so I had spoken with both of these gentlemen

330
00:22:25,695 --> 00:22:29,425
Speaker 3:  over the last few years as I've been covering the Smart Kitchen and

331
00:22:29,425 --> 00:22:33,385
Speaker 3:  they've both been involved in the space for over a decade. The

332
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:37,265
Speaker 3:  first is Ben Harris and he has is the founder of a company

333
00:22:37,265 --> 00:22:38,905
Speaker 3:  called Fresco. We're

334
00:22:38,985 --> 00:22:42,465
Speaker 7:  A software company. We're working with many of the large Appliance

335
00:22:42,465 --> 00:22:46,305
Speaker 7:  manufacturers to empower them to actually deliver on the promise of the

336
00:22:46,305 --> 00:22:46,745
Speaker 7:  smart kitchen.

337
00:22:47,485 --> 00:22:51,345
Speaker 3:  Its main sort of goal is to create a smart kitchen

338
00:22:51,765 --> 00:22:55,665
Speaker 3:  os that all your appliances can work on. They've done a really

339
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:59,265
Speaker 3:  neat thing where they've managed to figure out exactly the number of

340
00:22:59,265 --> 00:23:02,945
Speaker 3:  cooking terms there are out there and the types

341
00:23:03,045 --> 00:23:06,865
Speaker 3:  of cooking you would do. So things like bake, boil,

342
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:10,745
Speaker 3:  sous, and then how you would describe them. And then they've managed to

343
00:23:10,985 --> 00:23:14,665
Speaker 3:  standardize that format into operating system that will allow

344
00:23:15,205 --> 00:23:19,185
Speaker 3:  you to control any Appliance from a single app. Their app is

345
00:23:19,185 --> 00:23:23,025
Speaker 3:  one that you can use Fresco, but it also works in the Appliance app. So

346
00:23:23,025 --> 00:23:26,585
Speaker 3:  for example, they work with Instant Pot. They've also just announced a

347
00:23:26,585 --> 00:23:29,505
Speaker 3:  partnership with Viking and Panasonic

348
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:33,345
Speaker 3:  Thermomix, LG Kenwood, GE Appliances,

349
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:36,905
Speaker 3:  Electrolux. There's a whole load of brands that are working with them, although

350
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:40,385
Speaker 3:  this is still new and right now I think the only Appliance you can use with

351
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:43,785
Speaker 3:  the Fresco app is the Instant Pot. But it's an interesting approach and it

352
00:23:43,785 --> 00:23:47,685
Speaker 3:  to that interoperability issue that we've been, we've been discussing. He

353
00:23:47,925 --> 00:23:51,685
Speaker 3:  describes the Fresco Kitchen OS app as like Spotify connect

354
00:23:51,825 --> 00:23:55,725
Speaker 3:  in the Sonos app. It's basically a layer that can go into any Smart kitchen

355
00:23:55,825 --> 00:23:59,725
Speaker 3:  app and make your Appliance easy to use and interoperable,

356
00:23:59,915 --> 00:24:03,765
Speaker 3:  interoperable with other appliances, which is a great idea. If, you ask me.

357
00:24:04,085 --> 00:24:04,325
Speaker 4:  Yeah,

358
00:24:04,505 --> 00:24:08,325
Speaker 3:  Agreed. And then the other is Nick Holzherr of Samsung Food.

359
00:24:08,885 --> 00:24:12,805
Speaker 8:  I was the founder of Whisk, which was a startup that Samsung acquired and

360
00:24:12,805 --> 00:24:14,605
Speaker 8:  turned into what is now Samsung Food,

361
00:24:14,895 --> 00:24:18,805
Speaker 3:  Which anyone who has been interested in using apps to cook will

362
00:24:18,805 --> 00:24:22,405
Speaker 3:  have probably used. It was a great app that basically let you pull

363
00:24:22,435 --> 00:24:26,405
Speaker 3:  recipes from anywhere. You could scan your grandma's

364
00:24:26,735 --> 00:24:30,485
Speaker 3:  curry recipe and upload it to the Whisk app. Or you could find

365
00:24:30,545 --> 00:24:34,285
Speaker 3:  an recipe from the New York Times cooking app and you could just pull

366
00:24:34,285 --> 00:24:38,085
Speaker 3:  everything into one place. It makes it a lot easier to manage

367
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:41,485
Speaker 3:  your meal plans, your cooking experience for the week.

368
00:24:41,865 --> 00:24:45,845
Speaker 3:  And Whisk app has transformed into the Samsung Food app,

369
00:24:45,855 --> 00:24:49,805
Speaker 3:  which was launched last year, although it's sort of Whisk has

370
00:24:49,805 --> 00:24:53,765
Speaker 3:  been powering Samsung's food service, which has been part of its smart

371
00:24:53,765 --> 00:24:57,685
Speaker 3:  things app, which is Samsung's smart home platform. And now

372
00:24:57,745 --> 00:25:01,645
Speaker 3:  the Samsung Food app works with the smart fridge, Samsung Smart

373
00:25:01,645 --> 00:25:05,325
Speaker 3:  fridge works with Samsung's smart ovens to do some of the stuff we've talked

374
00:25:05,325 --> 00:25:08,405
Speaker 3:  about. So it can help you meal plan, it can help you

375
00:25:09,115 --> 00:25:13,005
Speaker 3:  send recipes, say you can, your fridge can tell your oven what

376
00:25:13,005 --> 00:25:15,525
Speaker 3:  you're cooking, that you're cooking a roast tonight and start preheating.

377
00:25:16,025 --> 00:25:19,925
Speaker 3:  So there's some interoperability there, which is interesting. And as I said,

378
00:25:19,925 --> 00:25:23,485
Speaker 3:  they've both been in this space for over a decade so they have

379
00:25:23,635 --> 00:25:27,205
Speaker 3:  lots of strong feelings about the smart kitchen and they have great

380
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:27,925
Speaker 3:  accents too.

381
00:25:28,325 --> 00:25:31,285
Speaker 4:  Well you know, they're, they're doing their best. No, it was a really good

382
00:25:31,285 --> 00:25:35,045
Speaker 4:  conversation. They, they're thinking about things in both similar and different

383
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:37,805
Speaker 4:  ways in a way that I thought was really interesting. But they both have the

384
00:25:37,805 --> 00:25:41,605
Speaker 4:  same sort of big vision for how all of this is supposed to feel as you cook,

385
00:25:41,605 --> 00:25:44,685
Speaker 4:  which I thought was very cool. It's an awesome interview. Let's just play

386
00:25:44,685 --> 00:25:45,485
Speaker 4:  it here. Let's roll it.

387
00:25:47,075 --> 00:25:50,725
Speaker 4:  Alright, So I. Just wanna start with kind of a big picture version of this

388
00:25:50,885 --> 00:25:53,885
Speaker 4:  question. What are we trying to do here? I think we talk about the smart

389
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:57,525
Speaker 4:  kitchen in these big broad sort of Jetson Z terms.

390
00:25:58,175 --> 00:26:01,485
Speaker 4:  Maybe someday, you know, decades in The future it'll look kind of like that.

391
00:26:01,505 --> 00:26:04,845
Speaker 4:  But I think you are both in a position of trying to figure out what is the

392
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:08,805
Speaker 4:  best and most useful and most interesting thing we can do, you know now and

393
00:26:08,805 --> 00:26:12,285
Speaker 4:  in a year and in two years and in five years, just to frame a lot of what

394
00:26:12,285 --> 00:26:15,565
Speaker 4:  we're gonna talk about here. What are you thinking about in that space? Nick,

395
00:26:15,585 --> 00:26:16,085
Speaker 4:  you go first

396
00:26:16,905 --> 00:26:20,725
Speaker 8:  We talk about joy making cooking more joyful. And I think

397
00:26:20,725 --> 00:26:23,965
Speaker 8:  there's lots of things that can do that for people. For some people it's

398
00:26:23,965 --> 00:26:27,885
Speaker 8:  taste, for some people it, which can include what you're cooking or the

399
00:26:27,885 --> 00:26:31,725
Speaker 8:  cooking outcome. The other part is the, the joy of

400
00:26:32,045 --> 00:26:34,845
Speaker 8:  actually the cooking process. Are you enjoying it? Is it fun? Is it, or or

401
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:37,605
Speaker 8:  are you constantly looking for facts? Health I think is an important part

402
00:26:37,605 --> 00:26:41,045
Speaker 8:  for some people waste. It can be an important part. There's lots of different

403
00:26:41,045 --> 00:26:43,605
Speaker 8:  parts. It means different things to different people, but joy is the word

404
00:26:43,605 --> 00:26:47,045
Speaker 8:  that we center around in our team. Ben,

405
00:26:47,045 --> 00:26:50,245
Speaker 7:  What about you similarly? Joy is definitely something that we have

406
00:26:51,395 --> 00:26:54,765
Speaker 7:  latched onto and it is really unique in the kitchen from an experience point

407
00:26:54,765 --> 00:26:58,725
Speaker 7:  of view. you know, when we really think about a, a moment I think that

408
00:26:58,725 --> 00:27:02,685
Speaker 7:  we're most focused on is, you know, that inner glow or

409
00:27:02,715 --> 00:27:06,645
Speaker 7:  that you have when you know, you've sat down the table and you know, your

410
00:27:06,645 --> 00:27:10,565
Speaker 7:  friends or your family are, you know, licking a plate clean across from

411
00:27:10,565 --> 00:27:13,965
Speaker 7:  you and just that inner pride that you have. I think

412
00:27:14,435 --> 00:27:18,165
Speaker 7:  more so than anything that's really the experience that we're imply empowering

413
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:22,725
Speaker 7:  consumers to, to get and sort of get into that moment as as easily as

414
00:27:22,925 --> 00:27:26,445
Speaker 7:  possible, you know, and giving them confidence to be able to get there. I

415
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:30,325
Speaker 7:  can add maybe a bit more context to that and sort of how we see we

416
00:27:30,325 --> 00:27:33,205
Speaker 7:  can get there. Just sort of how we think about the space a little bit. you

417
00:27:33,205 --> 00:27:36,605
Speaker 7:  know, I think one constant, I would say in the kitchen Appliance market over

418
00:27:36,605 --> 00:27:40,485
Speaker 7:  the course of the last sort of a hundred years has been, you know, any

419
00:27:40,485 --> 00:27:44,245
Speaker 7:  Appliance, any product that can make, give you better results, less effort

420
00:27:44,385 --> 00:27:48,245
Speaker 7:  has ultimately been successful. The oven to a microwave

421
00:27:48,245 --> 00:27:52,005
Speaker 7:  50 years ago to, you know, stand mixers a hundred years

422
00:27:52,025 --> 00:27:55,245
Speaker 7:  ago to pressure cookers, to air fryers in the last couple of years. Just

423
00:27:55,245 --> 00:27:59,085
Speaker 7:  how fast that has changed the market, you know, which I think air

424
00:27:59,085 --> 00:28:02,845
Speaker 7:  fryers are an amazing example and now leveraging

425
00:28:03,425 --> 00:28:06,525
Speaker 7:  iot and AI and content creators and screens out there.

426
00:28:07,225 --> 00:28:10,965
Speaker 7:  Is there a potential for us to finally deliver that like friend

427
00:28:11,035 --> 00:28:14,605
Speaker 7:  chef or a Jamie Oliver's sitting next to you in a kitchen essentially just

428
00:28:14,605 --> 00:28:17,925
Speaker 7:  by leveraging technology to actually say, actually no, this is how you,

429
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:22,365
Speaker 7:  you know, get a, add a squeeze of lemon in here or you know, this is how

430
00:28:22,365 --> 00:28:26,045
Speaker 7:  you can soften a, a cantaloupe or this is how you peel an onion and

431
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:29,925
Speaker 7:  now your steak is done. you know, I think it's, it's those little tips and

432
00:28:29,925 --> 00:28:32,845
Speaker 7:  tricks and helpers that we believe we can leverage technology to deliver

433
00:28:33,235 --> 00:28:37,045
Speaker 7:  that will ultimately be what the sort of smart kitchen is.

434
00:28:37,045 --> 00:28:39,645
Speaker 7:  Which sort of has a bit of a dirty name at the minute I think.

435
00:28:40,025 --> 00:28:43,565
Speaker 3:  So you think it's more about making the experience better

436
00:28:43,915 --> 00:28:47,605
Speaker 3:  than necessarily making the kitchen smart

437
00:28:47,605 --> 00:28:51,245
Speaker 3:  enough to like cook for us, because that's what the smart home today

438
00:28:51,895 --> 00:28:55,485
Speaker 3:  seems like. It's moving towards a, everything being automated,

439
00:28:55,715 --> 00:28:59,565
Speaker 3:  whereas the kitchen is already very automated. I mean, we have

440
00:28:59,925 --> 00:29:03,645
Speaker 3:  a robot in our kitchen that washes our dishes. you know, we've already got

441
00:29:04,245 --> 00:29:08,165
Speaker 3:  a lot of exciting useful technology in the kitchen and it feels

442
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:11,805
Speaker 3:  like that next step in the kitchen has been

443
00:29:12,105 --> 00:29:15,885
Speaker 3:  really hard to get to. And my theory is it's already so

444
00:29:15,885 --> 00:29:19,165
Speaker 3:  technologically advanced that it's kind of hard to get to that next step.

445
00:29:19,545 --> 00:29:23,165
Speaker 3:  So I understand you, you guys are sort of saying, well, you know, the outcome

446
00:29:23,215 --> 00:29:26,925
Speaker 3:  we're looking for is to make this kitchen experience seamless

447
00:29:27,025 --> 00:29:30,605
Speaker 3:  and make us all Jamie Oliver's or Nigel Lawsons or

448
00:29:31,175 --> 00:29:34,885
Speaker 3:  who's the American one, Martha Stewart. But yes, there's

449
00:29:34,995 --> 00:29:38,725
Speaker 3:  that experience level, but how are we gonna get from where we are

450
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,965
Speaker 3:  today to that joy? I feel like there's a big leap there.

451
00:29:42,525 --> 00:29:46,005
Speaker 8:  I think the way we, we look at it as like what are the problems that users

452
00:29:46,525 --> 00:29:49,925
Speaker 8:  actually have when they're in the kitchen? And I think there are some incremental

453
00:29:49,925 --> 00:29:53,845
Speaker 8:  changes you can make to appliances, but I agree there's a lot of automation

454
00:29:53,845 --> 00:29:57,165
Speaker 8:  in there already. But If, you look at where the problems are. Like for example,

455
00:29:57,165 --> 00:30:01,005
Speaker 8:  with food waste people, you know, you know that there's thousands of

456
00:30:01,005 --> 00:30:04,965
Speaker 8:  dollars, the figurine, the US is $3,000 per person a year that they're

457
00:30:04,965 --> 00:30:08,925
Speaker 8:  wasting on food and there's a, you know, the majority of consumers

458
00:30:08,995 --> 00:30:12,525
Speaker 8:  want to reduce their waste whether it's for environmental reasons or financial

459
00:30:12,525 --> 00:30:16,165
Speaker 8:  reasons or other reasons. So like that's an area where we know there's a

460
00:30:16,165 --> 00:30:18,965
Speaker 8:  problem and that's where one of the areas we're tackling with things like

461
00:30:18,965 --> 00:30:21,805
Speaker 8:  the family hub where we look at what's inside your fridge and create a pantry

462
00:30:21,825 --> 00:30:25,005
Speaker 8:  and give you recommendations that's like, that is making the cooking process

463
00:30:25,035 --> 00:30:27,845
Speaker 8:  more joyful. You're not watching soft scar in your fridge, you're saving

464
00:30:27,845 --> 00:30:31,725
Speaker 8:  money when it comes to cooking. There's lots of things that are happening

465
00:30:31,725 --> 00:30:34,005
Speaker 8:  there. They're a little bit, maybe a little bit more incremental than some

466
00:30:34,005 --> 00:30:37,725
Speaker 8:  of the pantry stuff with health. I think people want to be healthier and

467
00:30:37,725 --> 00:30:39,965
Speaker 8:  if they, if they achieve that, then it makes their life better.

468
00:30:40,595 --> 00:30:44,085
Speaker 4:  When we think about the smart kitchen, I feel like the vision in people's

469
00:30:44,085 --> 00:30:47,845
Speaker 4:  head is like, my stove flips my pancake

470
00:30:47,905 --> 00:30:51,205
Speaker 4:  for me and it, right? And it's like these little things where it's like the,

471
00:30:51,205 --> 00:30:55,125
Speaker 4:  the oven just makes the cookies for me and I don't even

472
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:58,165
Speaker 4:  have to think about it and I wanna talk about that road 'cause I think there

473
00:30:58,165 --> 00:31:01,405
Speaker 4:  is some stuff down that road. but it sounds like the way you both are thinking

474
00:31:01,405 --> 00:31:05,085
Speaker 4:  about it is actually sort of everything around that that like,

475
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:08,845
Speaker 4:  maybe I actually don't mind standing in front of my stove flipping my pancake.

476
00:31:08,845 --> 00:31:11,285
Speaker 4:  And one of my questions for you was gonna be, do people actually wanna stop

477
00:31:11,285 --> 00:31:14,125
Speaker 4:  cooking? I remember a couple of years ago when everybody was like, no one

478
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:17,245
Speaker 4:  will ever have to go to the grocery store again. Instacart. And like it turns

479
00:31:17,245 --> 00:31:19,805
Speaker 4:  out actually a lot of people really like going to the grocery store. It's

480
00:31:19,805 --> 00:31:22,965
Speaker 4:  like, it's a, it's a process, it's a thing. People enjoy it, people do it

481
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:26,205
Speaker 4:  on purpose. Like automating that out of existence is actually not what people

482
00:31:26,205 --> 00:31:29,605
Speaker 4:  are looking for. And I think to some extent making food for your family is

483
00:31:29,605 --> 00:31:33,165
Speaker 4:  that too. but it sounds like maybe we've been thinking about it as this very

484
00:31:33,405 --> 00:31:36,605
Speaker 4:  specific like act of making food is the thing we have to solve. And you're

485
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:40,205
Speaker 4:  both sort of describing everything around that as the more interesting set

486
00:31:40,205 --> 00:31:40,925
Speaker 4:  of problems.

487
00:31:41,365 --> 00:31:44,525
Speaker 8:  I think it's really not joyful If you if you're cooking something and you're

488
00:31:44,525 --> 00:31:47,405
Speaker 8:  burning it, right? That's a very non joyful experience.

489
00:31:47,555 --> 00:31:48,005
Speaker 4:  Sure. And I think

490
00:31:48,475 --> 00:31:51,405
Speaker 8:  It's definitely cooking things too. I don't think it's flipping your pancake

491
00:31:51,425 --> 00:31:54,085
Speaker 8:  for you in my opinion, but there's lots of, you know, things like controlling

492
00:31:54,085 --> 00:31:56,725
Speaker 8:  your oven or your, or your cooking device. But yeah, I absolutely agree with

493
00:31:56,725 --> 00:31:59,445
Speaker 8:  you that we, I'm definitely thinking about it way more broadly than like,

494
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:03,445
Speaker 8:  you know, is there a a robotic part to my of, to my oven that does

495
00:32:03,445 --> 00:32:05,725
Speaker 8:  something that I, I would usually do myself. And I actually think there's

496
00:32:05,725 --> 00:32:09,285
Speaker 8:  a lot of joy in cooking. I love personally the cooking experience,

497
00:32:09,285 --> 00:32:12,165
Speaker 8:  especially when it doesn't go wrong, if I haven't forgotten the ingredients,

498
00:32:12,165 --> 00:32:15,325
Speaker 8:  when I've got everything I need for it. If I know that it actually fits with,

499
00:32:15,785 --> 00:32:19,245
Speaker 8:  you know, my health goals that will make that process enjoyable and that's

500
00:32:19,245 --> 00:32:22,765
Speaker 8:  not taking me outta the process. I, I want to be part of it. I enjoy making,

501
00:32:22,765 --> 00:32:26,045
Speaker 8:  you know, it's like art. It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a hobby. It's in fact

502
00:32:26,045 --> 00:32:29,885
Speaker 8:  it's the world number two hobby, right? Cooking If, you survey people, it's

503
00:32:29,885 --> 00:32:33,765
Speaker 8:  number two hobby in the world. People like it, they do it not just

504
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:34,565
Speaker 8:  for the sustenance,

505
00:32:34,985 --> 00:32:38,765
Speaker 3:  But that's when you have the time, right? Because also what I

506
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:42,925
Speaker 3:  see in the smart kitchen is making cooking easier so that I,

507
00:32:43,025 --> 00:32:46,565
Speaker 3:  you know, yes, on Saturday morning when I wanna whip up, you know, the

508
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:50,485
Speaker 3:  pancakes and I wanna, you know, do the, the raspberry compote and I

509
00:32:50,485 --> 00:32:53,885
Speaker 3:  want, you know, the French press coffee, I'm going to enjoy putting that

510
00:32:53,885 --> 00:32:57,845
Speaker 3:  all together. But on a Monday afternoon when my kids coming home from

511
00:32:57,845 --> 00:33:01,045
Speaker 3:  school and I got three meetings and I need to get dinner on the table, I

512
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:04,925
Speaker 3:  want those Samsung arms that they showed at CES one year that will come down

513
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:08,605
Speaker 3:  and just get the food out the fridge, put it in the oven, and then I don't

514
00:33:08,605 --> 00:33:11,085
Speaker 3:  have to worry about it. Okay? I know I can order DoorDash, but you know,

515
00:33:12,165 --> 00:33:15,325
Speaker 3:  I still want to use what I have in my kitchen. I want, I want the kitchen

516
00:33:15,505 --> 00:33:19,405
Speaker 3:  to do as much of it for me as possible. Is there sort of, you know, both

517
00:33:19,405 --> 00:33:20,325
Speaker 3:  sides to this coin?

518
00:33:21,725 --> 00:33:24,365
Speaker 7:  I think that's a really interesting way of looking at it. And we sort of

519
00:33:24,365 --> 00:33:27,965
Speaker 7:  look at it in a similar way from a, from a product point of view. It's like

520
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:31,805
Speaker 7:  when you come home, you know, you we, you sort of pure point and DoorDash,

521
00:33:31,865 --> 00:33:35,765
Speaker 7:  we sort of have the, the promise of the food replicator that, you

522
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:39,205
Speaker 7:  know, I just push a button and then food arrives at my door and DoorDash

523
00:33:39,205 --> 00:33:43,085
Speaker 7:  or Uber Eats and Deliveroo across Europe, you know, so it's, and

524
00:33:43,085 --> 00:33:46,805
Speaker 7:  I think that's how we also think about it from a product point of view, sort

525
00:33:46,805 --> 00:33:50,085
Speaker 7:  of when you arrive home in that moment and then it's like you have to make

526
00:33:50,085 --> 00:33:53,925
Speaker 7:  that decision. Am I gonna cook tonight or am I gonna get DoorDash

527
00:33:53,925 --> 00:33:57,605
Speaker 7:  or have a frozen pizza? you know? And after both of them,

528
00:33:58,025 --> 00:34:02,005
Speaker 7:  you know, you feel that sort of guilt and sliminess and

529
00:34:02,005 --> 00:34:05,605
Speaker 7:  a bit of dirtiness if you've gotten takeaway or you feel that

530
00:34:05,755 --> 00:34:09,685
Speaker 7:  wholesomeness and happiness, if you've cooked, I'm sure you've all experienced

531
00:34:09,685 --> 00:34:13,245
Speaker 7:  that sort of like couple of seconds, a few microseconds that you've made

532
00:34:13,245 --> 00:34:16,965
Speaker 7:  that decision of which way you're gonna go. All the levers that

533
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:21,445
Speaker 7:  push you towards, oh Jesus, I'm just gonna watch Netflix and order Uber Eats

534
00:34:21,465 --> 00:34:25,325
Speaker 7:  are the ones we're looking to remove. That it's the, okay, am I gonna fail?

535
00:34:25,385 --> 00:34:28,405
Speaker 7:  Is it to next point, is this gonna burn? How do I get the ingredients? What

536
00:34:28,405 --> 00:34:31,805
Speaker 7:  am I gonna say gonna what I'm gonna cook? But if we can give you all of the

537
00:34:31,805 --> 00:34:35,685
Speaker 7:  helping hand and these monitoring pieces to ensure and give you confidence

538
00:34:35,685 --> 00:34:38,725
Speaker 7:  that you're gonna get great results that we believe, you know, that's ultimately

539
00:34:38,725 --> 00:34:42,525
Speaker 7:  what consumers want. So I think there's this amazing analogy from

540
00:34:42,525 --> 00:34:45,525
Speaker 7:  the fifties that I'm sure many of your listeners have, have listened to as

541
00:34:45,525 --> 00:34:49,445
Speaker 7:  heard as well. And this Betty Crocker analogy of when

542
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:53,405
Speaker 7:  it initially, when the powder mixes were released in the, in the

543
00:34:53,405 --> 00:34:57,205
Speaker 7:  fifties and they were sort of like babbling on from a sales

544
00:34:57,205 --> 00:35:01,045
Speaker 7:  point of view. So you had to, you know, add, I think just add water

545
00:35:01,105 --> 00:35:03,645
Speaker 7:  and then bung it in the oven and the sales are sort of like tipping along.

546
00:35:03,665 --> 00:35:07,045
Speaker 7:  And they did the consumer research and people just said, I just don't feel

547
00:35:07,245 --> 00:35:10,765
Speaker 7:  like I'm cooking. you know, IIII don't feel that inner intrinsic

548
00:35:11,055 --> 00:35:14,765
Speaker 7:  pride afterwards. And suddenly they're like, okay, let's remove the

549
00:35:15,105 --> 00:35:19,005
Speaker 7:  dry egg from the mixture and get consumers to start just

550
00:35:19,005 --> 00:35:22,765
Speaker 7:  crack the egg in and then add the milk, then mix and pud in. Suddenly

551
00:35:22,905 --> 00:35:26,805
Speaker 7:  the dynamic changed to be, okay, I am

552
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:30,605
Speaker 7:  now cooking this and I am now gifting people this cake and

553
00:35:30,765 --> 00:35:33,925
Speaker 7:  suddenly I have the pride and then suddenly, you know, sales

554
00:35:34,435 --> 00:35:38,285
Speaker 7:  skyrocketed. And that's really, I think, think where we are in the

555
00:35:38,395 --> 00:35:40,645
Speaker 7:  cooking assistant that we ultimately delivered

556
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:44,965
Speaker 8:  To Jen's point around being a busy parent, I, I'm a relatively new parent

557
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:49,045
Speaker 8:  as well, but I cook regularly. How do I do that? I I choose to

558
00:35:49,365 --> 00:35:52,765
Speaker 8:  automate out the grocery shopping part, right? To David's point, I don't

559
00:35:52,765 --> 00:35:56,645
Speaker 8:  choose to go to the grocery store if I'm trying to cook something. It is

560
00:35:56,845 --> 00:35:59,605
Speaker 8:  actually takes a long time to walk around that store. And you know, even

561
00:35:59,605 --> 00:36:02,925
Speaker 8:  If, you have a smart shopping list. It takes a while to go through that store.

562
00:36:03,325 --> 00:36:06,125
Speaker 8:  I choose to have that part automated away from me. The second thing I do

563
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:09,365
Speaker 8:  is I, I batch cook. I, I think a lot of parents do do that

564
00:36:09,985 --> 00:36:12,765
Speaker 8:  So, I cook, like three or four times the amount that's needed and then I

565
00:36:12,765 --> 00:36:16,485
Speaker 8:  put it in the fridge or the freezer and I will like reheat it and, and make

566
00:36:16,485 --> 00:36:19,245
Speaker 8:  it later. Right? And that's like So, I don't cook every day, but I have cooked

567
00:36:19,245 --> 00:36:22,165
Speaker 8:  food almost every day. But when you're actually trying to scale a recipe,

568
00:36:22,225 --> 00:36:25,245
Speaker 8:  that's also another area where technology can help. It's all these like small

569
00:36:25,245 --> 00:36:29,165
Speaker 8:  incremental parts where when you add it together, it does get rid

570
00:36:29,165 --> 00:36:32,885
Speaker 8:  of some of that like hassle and annoying stuff that you

571
00:36:32,965 --> 00:36:36,605
Speaker 8:  have to go through to make a meal. And, you know, remember all the right

572
00:36:36,605 --> 00:36:40,445
Speaker 8:  ingredients, make sure you've got the right quantities. Adapt

573
00:36:40,445 --> 00:36:43,445
Speaker 8:  the recipe to make, to make, to make that right amount. Don't have to go

574
00:36:43,445 --> 00:36:46,245
Speaker 8:  to the grocery store and have it just arrive for you. Someone brings your

575
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:50,205
Speaker 8:  bell and brings it to you. That makes you able to focus

576
00:36:50,205 --> 00:36:53,725
Speaker 8:  on that cooking part. Which I think lots of people actually really enjoy

577
00:36:53,725 --> 00:36:54,165
Speaker 8:  that part.

578
00:36:54,425 --> 00:36:58,125
Speaker 3:  But now, okay, you mentioned the fridge. When am I gonna be able to have

579
00:36:58,125 --> 00:37:01,125
Speaker 3:  my fridge do all of that for me though? Because that's what I want. I want

580
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:04,885
Speaker 3:  my fridge and my pantry to talk to each other and say, okay, she

581
00:37:04,885 --> 00:37:08,605
Speaker 3:  doesn't have milk. She wants to do pancakes tomorrow, we need to make sure

582
00:37:08,615 --> 00:37:12,405
Speaker 3:  she's got eggs and there's no flour in the, in the pantry. And, and

583
00:37:12,425 --> 00:37:16,405
Speaker 3:  you know, that that convenience is like, I I don't think

584
00:37:16,425 --> 00:37:17,605
Speaker 3:  anyone would argue with that.

585
00:37:18,085 --> 00:37:22,005
Speaker 8:  I think the answer's yes, and I think it's possible to say that with

586
00:37:22,005 --> 00:37:25,805
Speaker 8:  more confidence in the last year due to the advances of ai, right?

587
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:30,005
Speaker 8:  The challenge has been AI hasn't been good enough to kind of truly deliver

588
00:37:30,005 --> 00:37:33,165
Speaker 8:  on that. The latest version of the Family Hub, which is released this year,

589
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:37,205
Speaker 8:  as you said, like it tracks in and out actions on the fridge

590
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:41,485
Speaker 8:  that is new and it does accurately understand,

591
00:37:41,865 --> 00:37:45,685
Speaker 8:  you know, a, a good number of ingredients. No real user or

592
00:37:45,685 --> 00:37:48,965
Speaker 8:  very, very, very few users are going to manually input that stuff into their

593
00:37:48,965 --> 00:37:51,845
Speaker 8:  phones, right? Or, or their fridges or wherever it happens to be. You have

594
00:37:51,845 --> 00:37:55,565
Speaker 8:  to automate it. And people have tried things like, you know, barcode scanners

595
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:58,725
Speaker 8:  on bins. So as you put things in the bin, it's you, you scan the bar, people

596
00:37:58,725 --> 00:38:01,765
Speaker 8:  have tried all sorts of things and as soon as you ask the user to do a bunch

597
00:38:01,765 --> 00:38:05,645
Speaker 8:  of stuff there, it basically fails. So I do think AI

598
00:38:05,775 --> 00:38:09,765
Speaker 8:  means that it's actually, you know, it's, it's, some of it's here in

599
00:38:09,765 --> 00:38:12,965
Speaker 8:  some of the latest appliances of course need the latest one, you know, last

600
00:38:12,965 --> 00:38:16,285
Speaker 8:  year weren't do, hasn't got the right cameras in it and stuff. But like we

601
00:38:16,285 --> 00:38:19,125
Speaker 8:  are gonna see across the whole industry some really interesting

602
00:38:19,615 --> 00:38:23,085
Speaker 8:  capability jumps, leaps because of what AI

603
00:38:23,905 --> 00:38:27,765
Speaker 8:  is now able to do and how, how, how accessible AI is to

604
00:38:27,785 --> 00:38:30,525
Speaker 8:  all our, all our companies, right? To be able to leverage. It's, it's, it's,

605
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:33,565
Speaker 8:  I think that's, I'm, I'm super excited about AI and it goes beyond the fridge.

606
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:37,445
Speaker 8:  It goes into connecting data from health apps to food apps. It,

607
00:38:37,505 --> 00:38:39,285
Speaker 8:  it goes right across the whole, the whole space.

608
00:38:39,785 --> 00:38:42,245
Speaker 4:  Ben. What are you seeing on that front too? 'cause I think you're, you're

609
00:38:42,245 --> 00:38:46,085
Speaker 4:  in a position of, of being kind of less specifically integrated with an

610
00:38:46,085 --> 00:38:48,805
Speaker 4:  ecosystem, but also being able to like look more broadly at a lot of stuff

611
00:38:48,805 --> 00:38:52,085
Speaker 4:  like Jen is talking about, you know, Nick I'm sure is like

612
00:38:52,685 --> 00:38:56,285
Speaker 4:  required by company policy to exclusively have Samsung appliances everywhere,

613
00:38:56,825 --> 00:39:00,525
Speaker 4:  but that's, most people have this kind of amalgamation of stuff, right? And

614
00:39:00,525 --> 00:39:04,005
Speaker 4:  I think one of the things it seems like is maybe we don't need all of these

615
00:39:04,005 --> 00:39:07,045
Speaker 4:  things to be sort of perfectly intimately connected to get some of this stuff

616
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:10,005
Speaker 4:  you're talking about, but you're also in a position of being able to kind

617
00:39:10,005 --> 00:39:13,845
Speaker 4:  of make the whole greater than the sum of its parts of the kitchen,

618
00:39:13,845 --> 00:39:15,725
Speaker 4:  right? Are you seeing the same stuff with AI there?

619
00:39:16,305 --> 00:39:19,885
Speaker 7:  Yes, absolutely. It's been sort of transformational and I think has

620
00:39:20,555 --> 00:39:24,365
Speaker 7:  yeah, accelerated what we've thought was only possible over the course

621
00:39:24,425 --> 00:39:28,205
Speaker 7:  of a five year time horizon to, you know, 12 month time horizon.

622
00:39:28,305 --> 00:39:31,645
Speaker 7:  you know, it's like rapid changes in what's

623
00:39:32,165 --> 00:39:36,005
Speaker 7:  possible in the, in in the market. So yeah, for, for context, Fresco

624
00:39:36,005 --> 00:39:39,805
Speaker 7:  are working with, you know, Panasonic, GE Appliances, lg,

625
00:39:40,535 --> 00:39:44,445
Speaker 7:  Bosch, Kenwood Instant Brands, and for multiple other Appliance brands

626
00:39:44,585 --> 00:39:48,405
Speaker 7:  on our, our platform. Actually today or when this podcast goes,

627
00:39:48,435 --> 00:39:52,325
Speaker 7:  goes live, we're announcing a, a new partnership with

628
00:39:52,685 --> 00:39:56,405
Speaker 7:  a group called Middleby, which own brands like

629
00:39:56,825 --> 00:40:00,805
Speaker 7:  Viking and deeply integrating into their connected ovens

630
00:40:00,805 --> 00:40:04,165
Speaker 7:  and delivering the whole connected experience there as well. Because exactly

631
00:40:04,185 --> 00:40:06,685
Speaker 7:  to your point, no kitchen is is single brand

632
00:40:06,785 --> 00:40:07,605
Speaker 4:  Except for next.

633
00:40:08,185 --> 00:40:11,925
Speaker 7:  Except for next. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, you know, If, you want to,

634
00:40:12,305 --> 00:40:16,165
Speaker 7:  you know, deliver a delightful cooking experience, you know, it needs

635
00:40:16,165 --> 00:40:20,085
Speaker 7:  to be able to move from each brand to, to the next and, and, and

636
00:40:20,155 --> 00:40:24,125
Speaker 7:  elegantly move across the, the, across the full kitchen. And you know, as

637
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:28,125
Speaker 7:  Nick touched on there, it's this, you know, dot connecting, you know, which

638
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,965
Speaker 7:  is sort of needed in the kitchen, you know, like this is what we see right

639
00:40:30,965 --> 00:40:34,085
Speaker 7:  now that, you know, people are, they go to YouTube to figure out certain

640
00:40:34,085 --> 00:40:37,925
Speaker 7:  tips, they then look on Google for substitutions. They then

641
00:40:38,265 --> 00:40:41,525
Speaker 7:  go to their, sometimes have to, you know, figure out how, what's possible

642
00:40:41,545 --> 00:40:45,525
Speaker 7:  on their Appliance manual that that's, or on their, on their interface,

643
00:40:45,545 --> 00:40:49,525
Speaker 7:  you know, as Panasonic, one of our partners say is that like, you know, the

644
00:40:49,525 --> 00:40:53,485
Speaker 7:  only thing that microwaves are used for in the states is to reheat food and

645
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:53,965
Speaker 7:  to make popcorn

646
00:40:54,155 --> 00:40:55,405
Speaker 8:  Heat. Coffee and

647
00:40:55,405 --> 00:40:59,085
Speaker 7:  Coffee. Yes, exactly. And coffee. But it's got unbelievable capabilities

648
00:40:59,145 --> 00:41:02,805
Speaker 7:  inside of being able to, you know, perfectly defrost a pound of Turkey to

649
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:06,845
Speaker 7:  like, so If you can just, it's just making to Nick's point as well, making

650
00:41:06,845 --> 00:41:10,605
Speaker 7:  these points accessible and just a, a tap of a button

651
00:41:10,605 --> 00:41:14,405
Speaker 7:  available to you. So we've now got all of these pieces now represented

652
00:41:14,545 --> 00:41:18,125
Speaker 7:  in, in data in our backend infrastructure that then allows us

653
00:41:18,695 --> 00:41:22,085
Speaker 7:  armed with AI to just connect the Dots between these and actually deliver

654
00:41:22,205 --> 00:41:26,165
Speaker 7:  a delightful consumer experience that's contextual right in the moment

655
00:41:26,825 --> 00:41:30,245
Speaker 7:  to help you with exactly what you need at the, at the top of a bu. So like,

656
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:33,685
Speaker 3:  I could stick my Turkey in the Panasonic microwave,

657
00:41:33,955 --> 00:41:37,885
Speaker 3:  defrost it, and then my Viking oven will know that I

658
00:41:37,885 --> 00:41:41,645
Speaker 3:  am gonna be cooking the Turkey and can, and I can just press a button and

659
00:41:41,645 --> 00:41:45,485
Speaker 3:  have all the settings go to the Viking oven. I mean, how, how is that gonna

660
00:41:45,485 --> 00:41:48,245
Speaker 3:  work? Because one of the things I've noticed right now with Smart Kitchen

661
00:41:48,265 --> 00:41:51,965
Speaker 3:  is we have all these individual smart appliances

662
00:41:52,585 --> 00:41:55,965
Speaker 3:  and every time a new smart oven comes out, it's just its own

663
00:41:56,225 --> 00:41:59,685
Speaker 3:  little ecosystem. And there's like the Therma mix, which David and I have

664
00:41:59,685 --> 00:42:03,405
Speaker 3:  talked about in the past, and it's just a joy to use. It's a great smart

665
00:42:03,545 --> 00:42:07,125
Speaker 3:  gadget, smart kitchen gadget, but it's siloed in its own

666
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:11,125
Speaker 3:  ecosystem. I mean, we, we have a big, we everyone has an oven in

667
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:14,565
Speaker 3:  their kitchen, most people have a stove top. you know, you've got all of

668
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:18,445
Speaker 3:  these parts and pieces already, why we shouldn't need to buy individual

669
00:42:18,935 --> 00:42:22,525
Speaker 3:  smart appliances. What we have, I feel like could get

670
00:42:22,995 --> 00:42:26,845
Speaker 3:  more intuitive to use and more integrated, but that's just

671
00:42:26,845 --> 00:42:30,765
Speaker 3:  been a real roadblock to date, as is the whole smart home.

672
00:42:31,625 --> 00:42:35,565
Speaker 3:  Interoperability in general just doesn't seem to be moving us

673
00:42:35,715 --> 00:42:39,125
Speaker 3:  very far forward. And the kitchen feels like the biggest roadblock there.

674
00:42:39,145 --> 00:42:42,685
Speaker 3:  And I know Ben, that's very much what you guys are doing and also Samsung

675
00:42:42,825 --> 00:42:46,565
Speaker 3:  is doing with their interoperability through this home connectivity alliance

676
00:42:46,985 --> 00:42:50,805
Speaker 3:  and matter being able to bring other appliances into the apps.

677
00:42:51,145 --> 00:42:54,765
Speaker 3:  But then we're still having to use an app to control our kitchen. And I think

678
00:42:54,765 --> 00:42:58,365
Speaker 3:  that's a friction point, right? No one really, if you're standing in the

679
00:42:58,365 --> 00:43:01,405
Speaker 3:  kitchen, you don't wanna pull out your phone to press a button when you can

680
00:43:01,405 --> 00:43:05,085
Speaker 3:  just press a button on, on the device. Is there a future where,

681
00:43:05,905 --> 00:43:09,845
Speaker 3:  you know, I put the Turkey in the Panasonic microwave, it defrosts it,

682
00:43:10,305 --> 00:43:14,245
Speaker 3:  and everything else happens automatically and I can just move things from

683
00:43:14,245 --> 00:43:17,965
Speaker 3:  place to place, like move my Turkey around and without having to like, pull

684
00:43:17,965 --> 00:43:21,845
Speaker 3:  out an app or use an interface or use voice. I mean, where is that

685
00:43:22,045 --> 00:43:26,005
Speaker 3:  a, a realistic sort of future in the smart kitchen? Or are we, do we

686
00:43:26,005 --> 00:43:27,565
Speaker 3:  need to still be there and press buttons?

687
00:43:28,245 --> 00:43:31,445
Speaker 7:  I don't think we're that far away, you know, now, which is in incredibly

688
00:43:31,765 --> 00:43:34,365
Speaker 7:  exciting and sort of where we are in the, in, in the journey. you know, I,

689
00:43:34,525 --> 00:43:38,405
Speaker 7:  I I agree. I see a future where there's, you know, one screen in the middle

690
00:43:38,405 --> 00:43:41,805
Speaker 7:  of your kitchen that you can use to orchestrate all of your appliances, and

691
00:43:41,805 --> 00:43:45,325
Speaker 7:  that's where you get the, the feedback. but it's, it has to be multimodal.

692
00:43:45,325 --> 00:43:48,285
Speaker 7:  So you can sort of look at your Apple watch and see, okay, it's like another

693
00:43:48,285 --> 00:43:52,205
Speaker 7:  three minutes until your rice is, you know, ready, synced to the

694
00:43:52,205 --> 00:43:55,485
Speaker 7:  finish of your chicken in the oven. So it all sort of starts to come together

695
00:43:55,485 --> 00:43:58,605
Speaker 7:  at exactly the same time. And you can have this sort of automated process

696
00:43:58,705 --> 00:44:02,485
Speaker 7:  to move to your point, from the defrosting in the Panasonic

697
00:44:02,635 --> 00:44:05,925
Speaker 7:  oven to the, the quick transfer If you needed to over to

698
00:44:06,365 --> 00:44:10,045
Speaker 7:  OOO over to another Appliance. We have standardized the

699
00:44:10,405 --> 00:44:14,365
Speaker 7:  communication and the data format we believe needed for delivering

700
00:44:14,365 --> 00:44:17,765
Speaker 7:  this delightful guided or cooking experience in creating a, a digital

701
00:44:17,765 --> 00:44:21,325
Speaker 7:  representation of any recipe and digital

702
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,965
Speaker 7:  representation of, of any Appliance. So, you know, like really

703
00:44:24,965 --> 00:44:28,565
Speaker 7:  trying to break down how to digitally represent an Appliance

704
00:44:29,065 --> 00:44:32,380
Speaker 7:  in the, in the backend infrastructure to allow you, again, to connect the

705
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:35,645
Speaker 7:  Dots between all of these things and ultimately deliver this, this joyful

706
00:44:35,645 --> 00:44:36,085
Speaker 7:  experience.

707
00:44:36,595 --> 00:44:39,845
Speaker 3:  When you say digitally represent, can you break that down? Like what's, what's

708
00:44:39,845 --> 00:44:43,565
Speaker 3:  it doing like, so like my cooking app, say my Samsung Food app or my

709
00:44:43,565 --> 00:44:47,525
Speaker 3:  New York Times recipe app, it could know to like turn my oven

710
00:44:47,525 --> 00:44:51,365
Speaker 3:  to broil or So I mean what, how's that sort of

711
00:44:51,565 --> 00:44:52,525
Speaker 3:  actually working in the backend?

712
00:44:53,105 --> 00:44:56,885
Speaker 7:  So we scoured thousands of Appliance manuals and

713
00:44:57,205 --> 00:45:00,365
Speaker 7:  millions of recipes online. So we crawled them and sort of put them through

714
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:04,125
Speaker 7:  our sort of AI pipeline to start be able to process them. And we realized

715
00:45:04,195 --> 00:45:07,845
Speaker 7:  initially this has now grown, but there's actually 77

716
00:45:08,045 --> 00:45:11,205
Speaker 7:  cooking capabilities, you know, so bake, broil, steam,

717
00:45:11,705 --> 00:45:12,125
Speaker 7:  soused

718
00:45:12,405 --> 00:45:15,005
Speaker 3:  77, that's a lot. Yeah.

719
00:45:15,495 --> 00:45:18,925
Speaker 7:  Eight ways to describe them. So like time, temperature, speed, humidity,

720
00:45:19,055 --> 00:45:22,645
Speaker 7:  power. So like suddenly once you have that sort of Rosetta stone,

721
00:45:22,785 --> 00:45:26,405
Speaker 7:  that's sort of like how you can then map a recipe to an

722
00:45:26,525 --> 00:45:30,285
Speaker 7:  Appliance and Appliance capability and control. We now patented some of this

723
00:45:30,775 --> 00:45:34,565
Speaker 7:  experience as well, sort of how it's actually done, but allows us to then

724
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:38,165
Speaker 7:  search a recipe, see all the capabilities that are needed to be fulfilled

725
00:45:38,305 --> 00:45:42,165
Speaker 7:  and then map them onto the Appliance you have in your kitchen. And

726
00:45:42,545 --> 00:45:46,005
Speaker 7:  you know, it could say, you know, roast your chicken for, you know,

727
00:45:46,425 --> 00:45:50,405
Speaker 7:  an hour at 180 degrees. I think the amazing thing is like, so this is

728
00:45:50,405 --> 00:45:54,365
Speaker 7:  the way recipes have had to be written because all of our appliances are

729
00:45:54,365 --> 00:45:57,765
Speaker 7:  a little different. All of our chickens are a little different If, you have

730
00:45:57,765 --> 00:46:01,685
Speaker 7:  to give this generic one that's definitely gonna not poison people. So variably,

731
00:46:02,145 --> 00:46:05,645
Speaker 7:  you know, it's always overcooked and dry. Whereas, you know, these

732
00:46:05,645 --> 00:46:09,405
Speaker 7:  appliances now have unbelievable technology in them that, like

733
00:46:09,555 --> 00:46:13,285
Speaker 7:  with a temperature probe and you know, heating maps can actually put,

734
00:46:13,385 --> 00:46:16,445
Speaker 7:  you can, you've got chicken programs and the likes as well. But you know,

735
00:46:16,445 --> 00:46:19,045
Speaker 7:  all, all of these appliances now are, are having all of these sort of great

736
00:46:19,045 --> 00:46:22,885
Speaker 7:  programs, but nobody actually uses them because they're buried in

737
00:46:22,925 --> 00:46:26,845
Speaker 7:  a menu that is, some of them look like a VCR from the nineties,

738
00:46:26,945 --> 00:46:30,805
Speaker 7:  you know, you can't actually get get at them. So how do we again, surface

739
00:46:30,825 --> 00:46:33,885
Speaker 7:  it, connect the Dots between these two pieces and what your Appliance can

740
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:37,565
Speaker 7:  actually do. So you tap a button and you, your, so your chicken ends up,

741
00:46:37,985 --> 00:46:41,205
Speaker 7:  you know, moist on the inside, crispy on the inside, every single time and,

742
00:46:41,205 --> 00:46:44,765
Speaker 7:  and across your full kitchen. So that, that's the, the real opportunity.

743
00:46:45,315 --> 00:46:48,845
Speaker 3:  Doesn't there need to be like a much more basic common level

744
00:46:49,255 --> 00:46:52,685
Speaker 3:  where our appliances communicate with each other? Or is that not even necessary

745
00:46:52,745 --> 00:46:55,805
Speaker 3:  if we can just do it all in the cloud? And I, I guess that's the, the main

746
00:46:55,905 --> 00:46:59,325
Speaker 3:  key here, right? It's people are concerned about buying smart

747
00:46:59,325 --> 00:47:03,245
Speaker 3:  appliances because what is the benefit to me? And it's gonna be

748
00:47:03,245 --> 00:47:07,125
Speaker 3:  obsolete? Is it in five or 10 years? Whereas I want my most

749
00:47:07,145 --> 00:47:11,085
Speaker 3:  stoves, you know, you can have an aga that can last for 50 years.

750
00:47:11,815 --> 00:47:15,205
Speaker 3:  Where, where is that benefit to me as a consumer of this

751
00:47:15,205 --> 00:47:19,125
Speaker 3:  interconnected Appliance world? Is it coming or are we

752
00:47:19,355 --> 00:47:22,885
Speaker 3:  just gonna be stuck with relying on cloud interfaces rather than

753
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:24,725
Speaker 3:  local interfaces? Well,

754
00:47:24,725 --> 00:47:28,485
Speaker 8:  I think you've got things like Matter are meaningful when you've got Apple

755
00:47:28,485 --> 00:47:31,765
Speaker 8:  Apps and Google, Samsung and others around the table, right? That that's

756
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,605
Speaker 8:  a, that's a Fresco and Fresco, yeah,

757
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:35,525
Speaker 3:  And Fresco number one. Number

758
00:47:35,525 --> 00:47:36,125
Speaker 8:  One, exactly.

759
00:47:37,755 --> 00:47:41,285
Speaker 8:  That, that is meaningful. Like, and of course we can't force everyone to

760
00:47:41,285 --> 00:47:43,605
Speaker 8:  take part, right? Like there's gonna be, there's gonna be people that don't

761
00:47:43,605 --> 00:47:46,925
Speaker 8:  take part in that. But over time, if it's popular with consumers and consumers

762
00:47:46,925 --> 00:47:49,765
Speaker 8:  choose Matter devices because they want it all to work together, then people,

763
00:47:49,795 --> 00:47:53,125
Speaker 8:  then the others will eventually join, right? And I think

764
00:47:53,725 --> 00:47:56,525
Speaker 8:  ultimately driven by consumer demand, the software part becomes a little

765
00:47:56,525 --> 00:47:59,325
Speaker 8:  bit less important about, because if, as long as it works with matter, it'll

766
00:47:59,325 --> 00:48:01,525
Speaker 8:  then work with all the different, you know, the, the matter devices and you

767
00:48:01,525 --> 00:48:03,605
Speaker 8:  can switch that out, right? If you want to, and you can choose the best one.

768
00:48:03,805 --> 00:48:06,165
Speaker 8:  I think that's what's great about software. People can choose the best one

769
00:48:06,165 --> 00:48:08,685
Speaker 8:  and the best ones win. And you can win really, really fast. You build something

770
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:11,285
Speaker 8:  new and that's not unique to this space. You can, that's happens with social

771
00:48:11,285 --> 00:48:14,005
Speaker 8:  media companies that are huge and that's why some of them go out and buy

772
00:48:14,005 --> 00:48:16,805
Speaker 8:  other social media companies because the, you know, preference has changed.

773
00:48:16,825 --> 00:48:17,205
Speaker 8:  We have

774
00:48:17,205 --> 00:48:18,725
Speaker 3:  The Federated kitchen. Yeah,

775
00:48:18,905 --> 00:48:22,085
Speaker 8:  But actually one thing I would say is like, you know, I, I'm, I'm a startup

776
00:48:22,085 --> 00:48:25,205
Speaker 8:  founder. I'm not, I'm not like a, a company executive, but I think in my

777
00:48:25,205 --> 00:48:28,045
Speaker 8:  heart, but I'm still here at Samsung and, and why I think it's actually,

778
00:48:28,045 --> 00:48:32,005
Speaker 8:  it's really exciting for me, my personal reason is we have so many

779
00:48:32,005 --> 00:48:35,645
Speaker 8:  different appliances that are not just in the kitchen, just at Samsung, which

780
00:48:35,645 --> 00:48:39,605
Speaker 8:  we have first party access to, right? TVs are one watches and

781
00:48:39,605 --> 00:48:42,925
Speaker 8:  phones or another. And then of course we've got the kitchen. So what we can

782
00:48:42,925 --> 00:48:46,205
Speaker 8:  now, what we're starting to do is connect all these different parts where

783
00:48:46,225 --> 00:48:49,765
Speaker 8:  in, in, you know, if I, if I wasn't part of Samsung, I would basically need

784
00:48:49,765 --> 00:48:53,485
Speaker 8:  to go and build partnerships with another, you know, Fitbit or, or

785
00:48:53,485 --> 00:48:56,925
Speaker 8:  Apple Watch or whatever, to try and get that data in. At Samsung, we have

786
00:48:56,925 --> 00:49:00,365
Speaker 8:  that data here. If a TVs, I forgot to a different TV company we have, it's

787
00:49:00,365 --> 00:49:03,325
Speaker 8:  all first party. And first party gives you, you know, in today's security

788
00:49:03,345 --> 00:49:07,005
Speaker 8:  and kind of privacy world also gives you some benefits. There is interconnectivity

789
00:49:07,035 --> 00:49:10,965
Speaker 8:  that we can develop here. And then hopefully I, as a consumer, as

790
00:49:10,965 --> 00:49:14,205
Speaker 8:  a user, I would love to be able to expand that across other companies too.

791
00:49:14,205 --> 00:49:17,285
Speaker 8:  And I think Matter is definitely a positive for me as a, as a consumer, because

792
00:49:17,315 --> 00:49:20,805
Speaker 8:  like you Jen, I, you know, I would love to have different, different parts

793
00:49:21,065 --> 00:49:24,605
Speaker 8:  to my house. I'm never going to buy all my appliances from just one company.

794
00:49:24,745 --> 00:49:28,005
Speaker 8:  you know, I know David joked that my whole kitchen is just Samsung. I have,

795
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:30,525
Speaker 8:  I do have a family hub and I do have a bunch of, you know, Samsung devices,

796
00:49:30,525 --> 00:49:34,485
Speaker 8:  which I, which I love. But yes, I also have different appliances at my house.

797
00:49:35,075 --> 00:49:35,365
Speaker 8:  Sure.

798
00:49:36,395 --> 00:49:39,365
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I mean that it's not just the kitchen, is it? There's the, you know,

799
00:49:39,365 --> 00:49:42,525
Speaker 3:  the laundry room in Europe in particular, the laundry room's in the kitchen.

800
00:49:42,705 --> 00:49:46,605
Speaker 3:  So there's so much more this, this can extend to within the smart

801
00:49:46,605 --> 00:49:49,485
Speaker 3:  home. 'cause it does at the moment, again, feels like the smart kitchen's

802
00:49:49,485 --> 00:49:53,245
Speaker 3:  kind of siloed. And I feel like there is so much more potential for the way

803
00:49:53,245 --> 00:49:56,605
Speaker 3:  we can integrate our cooking into the whole home and not just

804
00:49:57,145 --> 00:50:00,965
Speaker 3:  be, I mean, I think Nick, we talked about like, you'll be watching TV and

805
00:50:00,965 --> 00:50:03,925
Speaker 3:  maybe watch an episode of Taste Made, which is like the only thing my husband

806
00:50:03,925 --> 00:50:07,485
Speaker 3:  watches. And then you could snap a picture and your oven could be ready,

807
00:50:07,745 --> 00:50:11,045
Speaker 3:  you know, your fridge can order you the food and your oven can get ready

808
00:50:11,145 --> 00:50:14,925
Speaker 3:  for, but I keep using that analogy, you know, I want

809
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:18,765
Speaker 3:  my, I want my fridge to buy the food and I want my oven to be ready to cook

810
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:21,765
Speaker 3:  it. But there's so much more to the kitchen. And I guess just to kind of

811
00:50:21,825 --> 00:50:25,805
Speaker 3:  as we wrap up, like where do you see the, the kind of future

812
00:50:25,915 --> 00:50:29,805
Speaker 3:  integration of the Smart Kitchen beyond just remote control

813
00:50:29,805 --> 00:50:33,525
Speaker 3:  of appliances? Like what is the kind of vision here where we can

814
00:50:33,715 --> 00:50:37,405
Speaker 3:  feel like our kitchen is worth adding smart

815
00:50:37,405 --> 00:50:41,245
Speaker 3:  technology into our kitchen? Where is the ultimate Smart Kitchen future for

816
00:50:41,245 --> 00:50:41,645
Speaker 3:  both of you?

817
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:45,565
Speaker 7:  For me, it's back to what I mentioned earlier, it's the, like, it it becomes

818
00:50:45,565 --> 00:50:48,805
Speaker 7:  your sous chef through the whole process. Yeah. To your point, you know,

819
00:50:48,805 --> 00:50:52,445
Speaker 7:  you, you, we've got a feed from the what's in your fridge and what's in your

820
00:50:52,765 --> 00:50:56,285
Speaker 7:  pantry. So it's like Ooh, you know, you've got this ine before it goes off.

821
00:50:56,385 --> 00:50:59,645
Speaker 7:  Here's a couple of nice recipes for you, you know, then your oven's starting

822
00:50:59,645 --> 00:51:02,405
Speaker 7:  to preheat. Here's all the other pieces that you, and it's just giving you

823
00:51:02,405 --> 00:51:06,325
Speaker 7:  the right prompts. So, you know, also you can just like remove

824
00:51:06,325 --> 00:51:09,605
Speaker 7:  that cognitive load so you're not worried sitting there sort of stirring

825
00:51:09,605 --> 00:51:12,765
Speaker 7:  rice, sitting over the stove. you know, it's like, you know, it's gonna,

826
00:51:12,765 --> 00:51:16,325
Speaker 7:  you're gonna get a ping when it's ready, you know, and, and all your food

827
00:51:16,325 --> 00:51:19,645
Speaker 7:  will be ready at the same time. And, and you have the intrinsic pride at

828
00:51:19,645 --> 00:51:22,725
Speaker 7:  the end of it that you've cooked it, you know, and then, so everyone's

829
00:51:23,155 --> 00:51:26,925
Speaker 7:  delighted. So it's like, like that is absolutely what drives

830
00:51:27,105 --> 00:51:30,645
Speaker 7:  me and the full team here at, at, at, at Fresco. And

831
00:51:30,645 --> 00:51:34,605
Speaker 3:  Are we there now though? Or is that The future? Like, it sounds like you

832
00:51:34,605 --> 00:51:35,965
Speaker 3:  sort of feel like we're already there.

833
00:51:36,265 --> 00:51:39,605
Speaker 7:  No, no, no. Yeah, there's definitely work to do to, to, to get there.

834
00:51:40,545 --> 00:51:44,445
Speaker 7:  But I think, yeah, that's where we can see is, you know, not too far

835
00:51:44,445 --> 00:51:47,685
Speaker 7:  away now. And you know, I think, as I mentioned earlier, you know, it takes

836
00:51:47,955 --> 00:51:51,925
Speaker 7:  time for hardware to be developed and and shipped. So we have, you know,

837
00:51:52,045 --> 00:51:55,485
Speaker 7:  a, a view now as to sort of where the kitchen is gonna be in,

838
00:51:56,105 --> 00:51:59,805
Speaker 7:  you know, 12, 24, 36 months. And I think, you know, one of the

839
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:03,725
Speaker 7:  inspiring things I would say that we can remind ourselves of is, you know,

840
00:52:03,925 --> 00:52:07,885
Speaker 7:  everyone thinks the kitchen, you know, space moves slowly, but

841
00:52:07,885 --> 00:52:10,725
Speaker 7:  I think just If, you look at air fryers, I think it's just such an amazing

842
00:52:10,725 --> 00:52:14,645
Speaker 7:  example of, you know, they've gone from, you know, no one talking about them,

843
00:52:14,825 --> 00:52:18,565
Speaker 7:  you know, four or five years ago to now being in everyone's kitchen

844
00:52:18,865 --> 00:52:22,205
Speaker 7:  and everyone talking about the way we cook. you know? So that's something

845
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:26,165
Speaker 7:  that has like globally been transformed in a relatively short period of

846
00:52:26,165 --> 00:52:29,205
Speaker 7:  time, and that can move faster with software. So, you know, I think that's

847
00:52:29,235 --> 00:52:31,925
Speaker 7:  what we're excited about over the course of the next couple of years.

848
00:52:32,265 --> 00:52:36,245
Speaker 8:  For me, I think it's the, all the different parts of your journey from inspiration

849
00:52:36,505 --> 00:52:40,245
Speaker 8:  to meal on the table, whether that planning, shopping,

850
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:44,525
Speaker 8:  cooking, eating, all of those parts, and we have, we have different features

851
00:52:44,525 --> 00:52:48,005
Speaker 8:  that we've already, you know, built in those, which we are gonna

852
00:52:48,005 --> 00:52:51,005
Speaker 8:  incrementally keep improving upon. But ultimately it comes in down to like

853
00:52:51,115 --> 00:52:54,925
Speaker 8:  sensors being able to predict and be, be making more

854
00:52:55,085 --> 00:52:58,805
Speaker 8:  predictive experience for, for us, and then integrations into more devices

855
00:52:59,525 --> 00:53:02,805
Speaker 8:  so it works more seamlessly with those devices. And those are all like, incremental

856
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:06,085
Speaker 8:  changes. And I think, you know, I, I think there's a fundamental kind of

857
00:53:06,085 --> 00:53:09,285
Speaker 8:  like vision. I do think it's gonna change drastically there. I think those

858
00:53:09,285 --> 00:53:12,565
Speaker 8:  are the real problems that we're in the kitchen that, that we are kinda already

859
00:53:12,565 --> 00:53:16,365
Speaker 8:  working on solving, but we are gonna make them all work better. I think

860
00:53:16,545 --> 00:53:20,445
Speaker 8:  the new part that I am more excited about now than I have

861
00:53:20,445 --> 00:53:23,685
Speaker 8:  ever been is health because of what a big problem health

862
00:53:24,225 --> 00:53:28,085
Speaker 8:  is for the, the world and for people in their lives. you know, obesity

863
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:32,005
Speaker 8:  and diabetes being the two bigger biggest ones, but there's lots and lots

864
00:53:32,005 --> 00:53:35,925
Speaker 8:  of other ones too, which matter a lot. And I do think there's a, a

865
00:53:35,925 --> 00:53:39,125
Speaker 8:  real role to play and, and it's not, I know it's not strictly in the kitchen

866
00:53:39,425 --> 00:53:43,365
Speaker 8:  and people might think of health as being more of about watches or step

867
00:53:43,565 --> 00:53:47,325
Speaker 8:  counting on your, on your phone, but actually what you eat has a huge

868
00:53:47,385 --> 00:53:51,125
Speaker 8:  impact on your health, right? Especially in those two things, you know, diabetes

869
00:53:51,185 --> 00:53:54,925
Speaker 8:  and people being overweight, So, I think like that opportunity to help people

870
00:53:54,985 --> 00:53:58,205
Speaker 8:  is, is huge. And actually it also drives consumer choice, right? you know,

871
00:53:58,205 --> 00:54:02,085
Speaker 8:  Ben mentions the air fryer. One of the reasons why people like an air

872
00:54:02,085 --> 00:54:06,005
Speaker 8:  fryer is not because it's another thing to put in your kitchen counter, right?

873
00:54:06,145 --> 00:54:08,605
Speaker 8:  And it, and it cooks stuff. It's because it cooks stuff healthily, right?

874
00:54:08,605 --> 00:54:12,565
Speaker 8:  Without oil. So like, it drives behavior. People want to be healthy, like

875
00:54:12,585 --> 00:54:16,285
Speaker 8:  it drives spending. For me, that's exciting because I'm trying to be healthy

876
00:54:16,345 --> 00:54:20,205
Speaker 8:  and I know how hard it is. And I, I've seen how

877
00:54:20,205 --> 00:54:23,365
Speaker 8:  good software experiences can help me be healthy. And I, I, I think there's

878
00:54:23,365 --> 00:54:25,485
Speaker 8:  a lot of, it's a big problem in the world and I think we have a lot that

879
00:54:25,485 --> 00:54:26,365
Speaker 8:  we can contribute to the world.

880
00:54:37,265 --> 00:54:40,645
Speaker 4:  All right. Back in the studio, I really enjoyed that and I had been thinking

881
00:54:40,645 --> 00:54:44,405
Speaker 4:  ever since we did it about the idea of joy

882
00:54:44,545 --> 00:54:47,645
Speaker 4:  in the kitchen being a thing, right? Which kinda goes back to the same stuff

883
00:54:47,645 --> 00:54:50,845
Speaker 4:  we were talking about. It's like what If you could do all the fun parts of

884
00:54:50,845 --> 00:54:53,645
Speaker 4:  cooking and none of the like monotonous

885
00:54:54,685 --> 00:54:58,005
Speaker 4:  nonsense, the like remembering to turn on the oven

886
00:54:58,465 --> 00:55:02,405
Speaker 4:  and how to set timers and yelling at your voice assistant.

887
00:55:02,405 --> 00:55:06,205
Speaker 4:  Like what if just the fun things was what you did in the kitchen?

888
00:55:06,305 --> 00:55:08,565
Speaker 4:  And like, what a great vision that is. I love them.

889
00:55:10,025 --> 00:55:13,885
Speaker 3:  It is, I know it, I, I, as I did point out, it is like, yeah,

890
00:55:14,005 --> 00:55:17,965
Speaker 3:  I love this idea of joy of cooking, but it's

891
00:55:17,965 --> 00:55:21,765
Speaker 3:  not as a mom of two with a full-time job and

892
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:25,845
Speaker 3:  a lot of extracurricular activities, joy of cooking maybe

893
00:55:25,945 --> 00:55:29,125
Speaker 3:  on a Sunday afternoon, but not on a Monday

894
00:55:29,715 --> 00:55:33,125
Speaker 3:  when I'm like desperately trying to get food on the table. So yeah,

895
00:55:33,965 --> 00:55:37,925
Speaker 3:  I think the joy of cooking is great, but I think ultimately if we can,

896
00:55:38,265 --> 00:55:42,125
Speaker 3:  and, and a lot of what both Ben and Nick said, really, I can

897
00:55:42,145 --> 00:55:45,965
Speaker 3:  see, I'm mean, excited to sort of try and see how using

898
00:55:45,965 --> 00:55:49,725
Speaker 3:  technology to make things streamlined and easier

899
00:55:49,905 --> 00:55:53,325
Speaker 3:  in the kitchen will maybe make Monday evening dinner

900
00:55:53,665 --> 00:55:57,405
Speaker 3:  joyful. Maybe. We'll see, I'm gonna try, I'm gonna test

901
00:55:57,465 --> 00:56:00,765
Speaker 3:  all this out and see, hopefully there won't be too much swearing.

902
00:56:02,385 --> 00:56:03,925
Speaker 3:  Am I allowed to swear on The Vergecast?

903
00:56:04,205 --> 00:56:07,605
Speaker 4:  Oh, I mean this about, about your kids in dinner. Yes, absolutely.

904
00:56:07,885 --> 00:56:11,485
Speaker 4:  That's, those are the rules. I I will say the solution that I have discovered

905
00:56:11,945 --> 00:56:15,725
Speaker 4:  is to have a 14 month old who doesn't want to eat anything that isn't graham

906
00:56:15,925 --> 00:56:16,205
Speaker 4:  crackers

907
00:56:17,815 --> 00:56:19,805
Speaker 3:  Makes it easier to cook. Yeah.

908
00:56:19,805 --> 00:56:23,005
Speaker 4:  Well, and, and what I've discovered is most of parenting is just giving your

909
00:56:23,125 --> 00:56:26,005
Speaker 4:  kid healthy food that they don't want to eat. And like, my diet has gotten

910
00:56:26,005 --> 00:56:29,365
Speaker 4:  better because I'm eating all the veggies that I make for him. It's ridiculous.

911
00:56:29,545 --> 00:56:32,445
Speaker 4:  But the thing that I'm struck by, and I'm curious how you feel before we

912
00:56:32,445 --> 00:56:35,725
Speaker 4:  get into this crazy experiment we're about to run on on you, is

913
00:56:36,265 --> 00:56:39,765
Speaker 4:  Ben and Nick are both really sort of optimistic about what the next couple

914
00:56:39,765 --> 00:56:43,285
Speaker 4:  of years are gonna be. And I think of course they are, they're in this space.

915
00:56:43,285 --> 00:56:46,405
Speaker 4:  They've founded companies like they're, they're startup guys, right? Like

916
00:56:46,405 --> 00:56:49,725
Speaker 4:  of course they're optimistic about where this is going, but you've been in

917
00:56:49,745 --> 00:56:53,565
Speaker 4:  the kind of mire and muck of trying to get all of this stuff working

918
00:56:53,825 --> 00:56:57,725
Speaker 4:  for a long time as they talk about AI and as they talk about the platform

919
00:56:57,725 --> 00:57:01,405
Speaker 4:  stuff. Are you optimistic that we're gonna get real

920
00:57:01,855 --> 00:57:05,045
Speaker 4:  moves in, in this space over the next couple of years? Are we gonna start

921
00:57:05,045 --> 00:57:06,925
Speaker 4:  to inch towards the stuff we've been talking about?

922
00:57:07,645 --> 00:57:10,725
Speaker 3:  I think you know me, I'm very optimistic.

923
00:57:11,555 --> 00:57:11,845
Speaker 4:  True.

924
00:57:13,225 --> 00:57:17,125
Speaker 3:  And I do feel like, as we said at the beginning, that, you know, with

925
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:21,085
Speaker 3:  generative AI and some of the technologies that have, that we're

926
00:57:21,245 --> 00:57:25,005
Speaker 3:  starting to see in the smart home Matter interoperability,

927
00:57:25,565 --> 00:57:28,885
Speaker 3:  I feel optimistic, but I do think there is still a major

928
00:57:29,235 --> 00:57:32,805
Speaker 3:  roadblock, which is that the smart kitchen is not an easy,

929
00:57:32,875 --> 00:57:36,765
Speaker 3:  there's not easy turnover. Hmm. you know, people aren't going to go

930
00:57:37,045 --> 00:57:41,005
Speaker 3:  and buy new, all new appliances. And so these, I still

931
00:57:41,005 --> 00:57:44,765
Speaker 3:  think we're gonna see a lot of these individual appliances like air

932
00:57:44,785 --> 00:57:48,365
Speaker 3:  fryers, we've talked about, everyone loves air fryers, but it's another

933
00:57:48,385 --> 00:57:51,765
Speaker 3:  device and another gadget you go put in your kitchen. I, I feel like that

934
00:57:52,155 --> 00:57:55,565
Speaker 3:  sort of beauty in the beast vision

935
00:57:56,345 --> 00:58:00,005
Speaker 3:  of the, the kitchen where everything just has its purpose and all works

936
00:58:00,245 --> 00:58:04,045
Speaker 3:  together and cleans everyone, everyone cleans themselves and cooks everything

937
00:58:04,045 --> 00:58:07,765
Speaker 3:  for you. you know, I, I feel like we're still a long way off from that, but

938
00:58:07,805 --> 00:58:11,645
Speaker 3:  I was really interested and as you picked up on the idea that really

939
00:58:11,645 --> 00:58:15,125
Speaker 3:  we need to start from the food and not start from the

940
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:18,605
Speaker 3:  appliances. And I think that's where for individual

941
00:58:18,965 --> 00:58:22,845
Speaker 3:  consumers, the smart kitchen gets much more interesting. I think the

942
00:58:22,845 --> 00:58:26,725
Speaker 3:  larger Appliance side of the issue is something that the

943
00:58:26,725 --> 00:58:30,605
Speaker 3:  manufacturers have to work out and that's gonna take a long time. As

944
00:58:30,605 --> 00:58:33,845
Speaker 3:  much as they're all starting to work together, we all know how well that

945
00:58:33,845 --> 00:58:34,245
Speaker 3:  works out.

946
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:39,085
Speaker 4:  Agreed. So before we get outta here, you have signed up

947
00:58:39,385 --> 00:58:43,085
Speaker 4:  to Heroically, run a self experiment on yourself

948
00:58:43,305 --> 00:58:46,645
Speaker 4:  for next week's episode. What is this experiment? Tell us what you're in

949
00:58:46,645 --> 00:58:47,485
Speaker 4:  for before we get outta here.

950
00:58:47,825 --> 00:58:51,645
Speaker 3:  So I am going to try to plan

951
00:58:51,745 --> 00:58:55,045
Speaker 3:  my meals for a week for my family, using

952
00:58:55,855 --> 00:58:59,325
Speaker 3:  Smart Kitchen Tech from apps to actual

953
00:58:59,375 --> 00:59:02,925
Speaker 3:  appliances, to voice assistance, smart

954
00:59:03,085 --> 00:59:06,725
Speaker 3:  displays, all the different tech that's in my kitchen, as well as a few pieces

955
00:59:06,725 --> 00:59:10,245
Speaker 3:  that I've called in for the experiment. I'm gonna use Samsung

956
00:59:10,635 --> 00:59:14,605
Speaker 3:  Food and the Fresco app to sort of test a little bit of what Nick and

957
00:59:14,605 --> 00:59:18,405
Speaker 3:  Ben were telling us and see how, how it all works out. And I'm gonna

958
00:59:18,465 --> 00:59:22,365
Speaker 3:  try and cook lots of ex foods that I've never cooked before

959
00:59:22,385 --> 00:59:25,445
Speaker 3:  and see if my smart kitchen can make me a better chef.

960
00:59:26,265 --> 00:59:29,765
Speaker 3:  And yeah, it's gonna be fun. It might get a bit messy.

961
00:59:30,785 --> 00:59:33,005
Speaker 4:  Is your family prepared for what you're about to do to

962
00:59:33,005 --> 00:59:34,565
Speaker 3:  Them? No. Okay,

963
00:59:34,715 --> 00:59:35,005
Speaker 1:  Good.

964
00:59:35,055 --> 00:59:36,325
Speaker 4:  Let's ride for the best. I'll

965
00:59:36,325 --> 00:59:37,445
Speaker 3:  Just spring it on them and Who

966
00:59:37,445 --> 00:59:39,165
Speaker 4:  Knows, maybe it'll go amazing. Maybe

967
00:59:39,485 --> 00:59:42,725
Speaker 3:  There'll be lots of food to eat, so that should make them happy.

968
00:59:43,995 --> 00:59:47,445
Speaker 3:  Cooking is hard though, so I'm probably gonna be quite tired and cranky after

969
00:59:47,445 --> 00:59:47,885
Speaker 3:  all of this.

970
00:59:48,155 --> 00:59:51,845
Speaker 4:  Yeah, we, we've asked you to, to keep a sort of running diary as you're doing

971
00:59:51,845 --> 00:59:55,685
Speaker 4:  this, and I am extremely excited to hear unfiltered, just finished

972
00:59:55,685 --> 00:59:59,485
Speaker 4:  dinner, Jen thoughts on the Smart Kitchen. I'm very, very excited

973
00:59:59,485 --> 01:00:03,325
Speaker 4:  about it. But awesome. Thank you again for doing this. We're gonna be back

974
01:00:03,395 --> 01:00:06,925
Speaker 4:  next Sunday with the Wild Results of Jen's experiment.

975
