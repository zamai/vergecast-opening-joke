00:00:02,555 --> 00:00:06,325
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Endlessly Looping

3
00:00:06,325 --> 00:00:10,325
Speaker 2:  Sounds. I'm your friend David Pierce and I'm inside. All

4
00:00:10,325 --> 00:00:14,205
Speaker 2:  I've been is inside these last few days because I'm in Washington DC

5
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:17,885
Speaker 2:  where it's freezing cold and snowing and not only is it

6
00:00:18,055 --> 00:00:21,805
Speaker 2:  nasty to be outside, but this seems to be one of those cities where

7
00:00:22,085 --> 00:00:25,405
Speaker 2:  everyone just forgets how to drive as soon as any kind of

8
00:00:25,685 --> 00:00:29,525
Speaker 2:  precipitation happens, like even the idea that it might rain and

9
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:32,565
Speaker 2:  everybody just starts driving a thousand miles an hour into medians for some

10
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:36,445
Speaker 2:  reason. So basically, not only is it just kind of gross to go

11
00:00:36,445 --> 00:00:40,005
Speaker 2:  outside right now, it's legitimately dangerous to my health.

12
00:00:40,385 --> 00:00:43,765
Speaker 2:  So the last few days I've gone out to walk the dog and grow grocery shopping

13
00:00:43,905 --> 00:00:47,645
Speaker 2:  and that's pretty much it. Here's hoping for better weather

14
00:00:47,835 --> 00:00:51,805
Speaker 2:  both for me and for a lot of folks really soon. Anyway, we have a

15
00:00:51,805 --> 00:00:55,205
Speaker 2:  great show for you today. Now that the holidays and CES are over, we are

16
00:00:55,235 --> 00:00:59,165
Speaker 2:  back to our regularly scheduled Vergecast programming and we have a bunch

17
00:00:59,165 --> 00:01:02,285
Speaker 2:  of good stuff for you. Today we're gonna talk about TikTok, specifically

18
00:01:02,305 --> 00:01:06,125
Speaker 2:  one part of TikTok and even more specifically one sound that has taken

19
00:01:06,155 --> 00:01:09,845
Speaker 2:  over that one specific part of TikTok in a totally fascinating way.

20
00:01:10,035 --> 00:01:13,165
Speaker 2:  Then we're gonna talk about streaming services because this is going to be

21
00:01:13,475 --> 00:01:17,205
Speaker 2:  another big year for streaming services and not everyone is gonna

22
00:01:17,205 --> 00:01:20,445
Speaker 2:  survive it. All. That's coming up in just a sec, but first I have to find

23
00:01:20,445 --> 00:01:23,885
Speaker 2:  the space heater because even just looking out the window is making me cold.

Speaker 4:  details.

43
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:44,925
Speaker 2:  Welcome back so a few weeks ago I noticed I started

44
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:48,845
Speaker 2:  hearing this one song on TikTok over and over and

45
00:02:48,845 --> 00:02:52,365
Speaker 2:  over and over again. That itself is not

46
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:55,965
Speaker 2:  surprising or interesting, right? I mean there's a new viral thing on TikTok

47
00:02:55,965 --> 00:02:59,725
Speaker 2:  once a week and I think at this point I know 30 seconds of every popular

48
00:02:59,955 --> 00:03:03,325
Speaker 2:  song on earth just because of TikTok, but this song just

49
00:03:03,715 --> 00:03:07,565
Speaker 2:  immediately jumps out as different. It's not the backing track

50
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:11,365
Speaker 2:  for a dance challenge and nobody's using it to make like cute videos of their

51
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:15,045
Speaker 2:  kids. It's the opposite. Actually. This song seems to be

52
00:03:15,145 --> 00:03:19,045
Speaker 2:  the official soundtrack of terrifying TikTok videos,

53
00:03:19,635 --> 00:03:23,205
Speaker 2:  like videos showing Bigfoot sightings and deep Sea

54
00:03:23,525 --> 00:03:27,365
Speaker 2:  monsters captured through all of those always blurry camera shots.

55
00:03:27,385 --> 00:03:31,045
Speaker 2:  You know what I'm talking about? Videos with captions like things they didn't

56
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:34,685
Speaker 2:  want you to know about, but mostly it's videos about the North

57
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:35,045
Speaker 2:  Sea

58
00:03:36,935 --> 00:03:40,685
Speaker 2:  North Sea TikTok has been booming the last couple of months and

59
00:03:40,685 --> 00:03:44,085
Speaker 2:  this song is the soundtrack. Big ships

60
00:03:44,365 --> 00:03:48,085
Speaker 2:  crashing down into huge waves, workers dangling

61
00:03:48,085 --> 00:03:51,685
Speaker 2:  from oil rigs while the water roils around them deep

62
00:03:51,915 --> 00:03:55,485
Speaker 2:  dark water capsizing ships or tossing a bunch of shipping

63
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:59,405
Speaker 2:  containers overboard into the Sea. This trend seemed to take off

64
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:03,325
Speaker 2:  really in late November and early December and is still going

65
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:07,005
Speaker 2:  strong now and it seems like practically every one of those videos

66
00:04:07,745 --> 00:04:08,885
Speaker 2:  has this song Underneath

67
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:09,845
Speaker 6:  Yo.

68
00:04:13,305 --> 00:04:15,445
Speaker 6:  Oh, all Hands.

69
00:04:37,905 --> 00:04:41,515
Speaker 2:  This song is called Hoist the Colors. It was originally written by Han

70
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:45,315
Speaker 2:  Zimmer for the not very good movie, pirates of the Caribbean. At

71
00:04:45,315 --> 00:04:49,155
Speaker 2:  World's End, it's this early scene in the movie where a bunch

72
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:53,075
Speaker 2:  of pirates or people accused of consorting with pirates are about to

73
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:56,635
Speaker 2:  be hanged and they start to sing a song together at the Gallows.

74
00:04:56,855 --> 00:04:58,195
Speaker 2:  Here's what it sounds like in the movie.

75
00:05:18,415 --> 00:05:22,355
Speaker 2:  The version going viral on TikTok is by a group called the Bass Singers

76
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:25,995
Speaker 2:  of TikTok and the story of this song starts with this guy, so

77
00:05:25,995 --> 00:05:29,955
Speaker 7:  You can enter me as Bobby Waters, also known as Bobby Bass.

78
00:05:30,255 --> 00:05:33,275
Speaker 7:  My real name is not Bobby Bass, that's just my stage name.

79
00:05:33,815 --> 00:05:37,475
Speaker 2:  If you're a regular TikTok viewer, there's a decent chance you've heard of

80
00:05:37,475 --> 00:05:41,195
Speaker 2:  Bobby too or at least seen some of his videos. He's gone pretty viral

81
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:44,755
Speaker 2:  a few times. He started posting on the platform a couple of years ago during

82
00:05:44,755 --> 00:05:45,235
Speaker 2:  the pandemic.

83
00:05:45,835 --> 00:05:49,595
Speaker 7:  I was in my junior year of college and everyone went home. So I just had

84
00:05:49,595 --> 00:05:52,875
Speaker 7:  all this time on my hand. I was only taking like one online class over the

85
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:53,075
Speaker 7:  summer.

86
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:57,165
Speaker 2:  Bobby's friend showed him a TikTok of this emerging trend at the time

87
00:05:57,295 --> 00:06:01,285
Speaker 2:  where bass singers would add bass to other songs on TikTok.

88
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:05,285
Speaker 8:  Where did I go wrong? I lost a

89
00:06:05,385 --> 00:06:09,165
Speaker 8:  friend somewhere along in the bitterness.

90
00:06:09,795 --> 00:06:13,205
Speaker 2:  They just give them some real like low end energy. You know

91
00:06:13,695 --> 00:06:17,525
Speaker 2:  Bobby, as I'm confident you can tell by his voice, is a bass singer.

92
00:06:17,865 --> 00:06:21,685
Speaker 2:  He dug the trend and he started doing the same thing. Dueting a song on

93
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:24,325
Speaker 2:  TikTok and adding a deep boomy bass to it.

94
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:25,405
Speaker 9:  I'm So

95
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:31,485
Speaker 9:  I, confident

96
00:06:33,145 --> 00:06:35,005
Speaker 9:  I'm unstoppable today.

97
00:06:36,275 --> 00:06:40,165
Speaker 2:  This group of Bass adders became kind of a community on TikTok.

98
00:06:40,545 --> 00:06:44,445
Speaker 7:  TikTok was a great way for bass singers to kinda like add what they

99
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:48,285
Speaker 7:  do, whether it be a duet or whether it would be singing a song like an octave

100
00:06:48,285 --> 00:06:52,125
Speaker 7:  lower or just doing their bass thing. It drew a lot of attention to bass

101
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:55,525
Speaker 7:  singing in general. So a bunch of young bass singers were like, oh, I didn't

102
00:06:55,525 --> 00:06:58,925
Speaker 7:  know I could do this. So they would hop on the app and kind of do a similar

103
00:06:58,935 --> 00:07:02,925
Speaker 7:  thing. And so now we have all this like new generation of bass singers coming

104
00:07:02,925 --> 00:07:06,885
Speaker 7:  up and then around the end of 2020 I was saying like the

105
00:07:07,065 --> 00:07:08,485
Speaker 7:  Sea shanty craze started happening.

106
00:07:09,105 --> 00:07:13,005
Speaker 2:  You remember the Sea shanty craze, right? Especially the one song. Soon

107
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:16,805
Speaker 2:  may the weatherman come, it was like completely ubiquitous

108
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:17,405
Speaker 2:  for a while.

109
00:07:18,075 --> 00:07:21,885
Speaker 10:  Soon may the weatherman come to bring a sugar and tea

110
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:26,005
Speaker 10:  and rum one day when the tongue is done will take on

111
00:07:26,115 --> 00:07:26,965
Speaker 10:  even go.

112
00:07:27,635 --> 00:07:31,605
Speaker 2:  Everybody including these bass singers was making Sea shanty videos for a

113
00:07:31,605 --> 00:07:35,245
Speaker 2:  while. Things got weird during the Pandemic, you guys, this particular video

114
00:07:35,395 --> 00:07:38,965
Speaker 2:  from a singer named Nathan Evans and a bunch of other folks was probably

115
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:42,805
Speaker 2:  the apex of the whole thing. The Sea shanty trend got so big that

116
00:07:42,815 --> 00:07:46,765
Speaker 2:  Bobby and a few other singers formed a group called The Weatherman. They

117
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:49,685
Speaker 2:  got a record deal and they made an album of these Sea shanties.

118
00:07:50,745 --> 00:07:54,325
Speaker 11:  The whales tale came up and caught her hands to the side

119
00:07:55,915 --> 00:07:57,405
Speaker 11:  when shed down low

120
00:07:59,385 --> 00:08:03,045
Speaker 2:  On his own. TikTok though Bobby kept making stuff dueting other songs to

121
00:08:03,045 --> 00:08:07,005
Speaker 2:  add bass and just seeing what worked. Part of being on TikTok is you

122
00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:10,885
Speaker 2:  just try stuff and you see what works and a super bassy cover

123
00:08:10,885 --> 00:08:13,765
Speaker 2:  that he had done of Hoist the Colors did pretty well.

124
00:08:14,505 --> 00:08:14,725
Speaker 9:  Yo,

125
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:19,965
Speaker 9:  oh and

126
00:08:23,255 --> 00:08:25,885
Speaker 2:  Bobby also just happened to really love the song.

127
00:08:27,815 --> 00:08:31,265
Speaker 7:  Just like one person just starts singing and then everyone joins in, all

128
00:08:31,265 --> 00:08:34,465
Speaker 7:  the pirates join in and it's kind of like this, it's almost like scary. It's

129
00:08:34,465 --> 00:08:37,825
Speaker 7:  like they're singing, dude. Like just imagine if everyone who you're about

130
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:40,865
Speaker 7:  to execute just starts singing the whole song and literally the whole see

131
00:08:40,865 --> 00:08:44,825
Speaker 7:  can hear it. It lends itself very, very well. Songs like

132
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:48,625
Speaker 7:  that. Songs like Misty Mountains, they're, they're very like Bass anthem,

133
00:08:48,635 --> 00:08:52,585
Speaker 7:  these like slow minor songs that just kind of almost

134
00:08:52,755 --> 00:08:56,645
Speaker 7:  folky, almost like working. See shanty like io hoist. The

135
00:08:56,645 --> 00:09:00,245
Speaker 7:  colors a couple of different things because the first one that I did that

136
00:09:00,245 --> 00:09:03,285
Speaker 7:  really blew up was with a, an amazing singer called Melinda.

137
00:09:18,395 --> 00:09:22,325
Speaker 2:  That video Bobby told me took him from 200,000 followers on

138
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:26,165
Speaker 2:  TikTok to over a million. Bobby and Melinda ended up making and

139
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:29,445
Speaker 2:  releasing a full version, which is really cool, but that's not the one we're

140
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:33,245
Speaker 2:  talking about. Neither are the other experiments and duets that Bobby did

141
00:09:33,245 --> 00:09:36,285
Speaker 2:  of hoist the colors, all of which kept doing well. There's something about

142
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:39,245
Speaker 2:  this song that people on TikTok really like. But then

143
00:09:39,865 --> 00:09:43,765
Speaker 7:  So one morning, as soon as I woke up I was like, screw it, let's do

144
00:09:43,765 --> 00:09:47,565
Speaker 7:  it. And So I just went over to my computer, started planning it, started

145
00:09:47,725 --> 00:09:50,645
Speaker 7:  a session, started reaching out to some people. He ended

146
00:09:50,845 --> 00:09:54,685
Speaker 2:  Up with a handful of different bass singers, most of whom he'd either worked

147
00:09:54,685 --> 00:09:56,365
Speaker 2:  with or duetted or both.

148
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:00,685
Speaker 7:  There were seven vocalists on the track that we ended up making. It was me,

149
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:03,725
Speaker 7:  Bobby, it was Davide. He was one of the soloists,

150
00:10:04,075 --> 00:10:07,645
Speaker 7:  Eric Holloway who is one of the lowest voices on the planet

151
00:10:07,945 --> 00:10:11,765
Speaker 7:  and he has the third very, very, very deep solo. And then

152
00:10:12,105 --> 00:10:15,885
Speaker 7:  for the other background singers, we had Danny Brek, also known as Big Brev.

153
00:10:15,885 --> 00:10:19,445
Speaker 7:  He had like all the baritone parts. Luke Taylor who we both know,

154
00:10:19,905 --> 00:10:23,645
Speaker 7:  one of the dudes from the Wellman, other super low bass. We had eBucks also

155
00:10:23,645 --> 00:10:27,085
Speaker 7:  named whose real name is Nelson. And then we had this Nyle

156
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:31,285
Speaker 7:  whose real name is Jesse. I kind of just put together this kinda like

157
00:10:31,285 --> 00:10:33,045
Speaker 7:  dream team of singers. Bobby

158
00:10:33,055 --> 00:10:36,725
Speaker 2:  Spent a couple of weeks arranging the song, sent out all the individual parts

159
00:10:36,745 --> 00:10:40,205
Speaker 2:  to the singers and then had them record themselves a bunch of times each.

160
00:10:40,465 --> 00:10:44,085
Speaker 7:  So just made a whole Google folder with documents and folders to put like

161
00:10:44,085 --> 00:10:48,005
Speaker 7:  your audio files and videos. They weren't just recording like one line

162
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:51,725
Speaker 7:  for one part. I gave each of them like a couple different parts to sing like

163
00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:55,445
Speaker 7:  base one and base two. I gave Danny three or four

164
00:10:55,445 --> 00:10:59,005
Speaker 7:  different baritone parts and had them all record probably

165
00:10:59,585 --> 00:11:03,445
Speaker 7:  two or three takes of each part because if we just had seven

166
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:07,485
Speaker 7:  voices on this and layered it sound cool, but it wouldn't sound

167
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:11,365
Speaker 7:  like as grand as like all of them like layered with like a ton of

168
00:11:11,365 --> 00:11:14,845
Speaker 7:  different voices, kind of like a choir. We don't have a choir. We all couldn't

169
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:18,845
Speaker 7:  sing together because we were all over the world. So we just recorded a

170
00:11:18,925 --> 00:11:22,645
Speaker 7:  ton of different tracks. I put them all together and I produced the rest

171
00:11:22,905 --> 00:11:23,485
Speaker 7:  of the session.

172
00:11:24,095 --> 00:11:28,085
Speaker 2:  Bobby also got some help mixing the track and had some friends add violin

173
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:31,645
Speaker 2:  and cello at the beginning and put this whole thing together. A few weeks

174
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:35,605
Speaker 2:  later the song is done. Bobby makes a quick music video for it and he

175
00:11:35,605 --> 00:11:39,165
Speaker 2:  uploads it to one of those sites that distributes your song to basically

176
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:42,965
Speaker 2:  all the platforms everywhere. The song did well from the beginning, not like

177
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:46,805
Speaker 2:  massively viral well but solidly growing fast. Good

178
00:11:46,805 --> 00:11:50,325
Speaker 2:  song, people are listening and that's what it did for most of 2023.

179
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,765
Speaker 2:  Then North Sea TikTok happened.

180
00:12:00,925 --> 00:12:04,845
Speaker 2:  I can't prove this because tiktoks search tools are terrible and incredibly

181
00:12:04,845 --> 00:12:08,725
Speaker 2:  underpowered and basically useless, but I think, I think you can

182
00:12:08,725 --> 00:12:12,445
Speaker 2:  trace the beginning of this trend to a video from an account called UK

183
00:12:12,655 --> 00:12:16,445
Speaker 2:  Towns in late November. This account had been around for a while, mostly

184
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:20,285
Speaker 2:  posting videos about cool unknown places around the uk, but

185
00:12:20,285 --> 00:12:23,965
Speaker 2:  then kind of out of nowhere it posted a video about this beautiful

186
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:27,245
Speaker 2:  pure water from a glacier which blew up. It has

187
00:12:27,485 --> 00:12:31,325
Speaker 2:  14.3 million views on TikTok right now. There's a decent chance you've seen

188
00:12:31,325 --> 00:12:35,285
Speaker 2:  it. And then the next day, November 27th, 2023, that

189
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:39,205
Speaker 2:  same account UK towns posted a video with the text The

190
00:12:39,205 --> 00:12:42,965
Speaker 2:  North Sea, the most treacherous Sea in the world written over top of it.

191
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:46,605
Speaker 2:  It was all the stuff you now see everywhere, this huge

192
00:12:47,205 --> 00:12:50,445
Speaker 2:  aircraft carrier looking ship rolling in the waves,

193
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,885
Speaker 2:  waves crashing up on a dock and almost knocking someone in the water. Big

194
00:12:54,945 --> 00:12:58,525
Speaker 2:  storms, big water. You get the idea that video now has

195
00:12:58,605 --> 00:13:02,365
Speaker 2:  118 million views and it had this sound playing

196
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,485
Speaker 2:  underneath he

197
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:21,925
Speaker 2:  North Sea. TikTok took off in a huge, huge way. From

198
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:25,005
Speaker 2:  there I asked TikTok to pull some data for me and the numbers are pretty

199
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:29,125
Speaker 2:  wild. The North Sea hashtag has 2.9 billion

200
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:32,965
Speaker 2:  global views on TikTok. 2.2 of them coming just since the

201
00:13:32,965 --> 00:13:36,845
Speaker 2:  beginning of November. That was a 315% increase in

202
00:13:36,845 --> 00:13:40,165
Speaker 2:  views in those two months. The North Sea TikTok hashtag

203
00:13:40,725 --> 00:13:44,605
Speaker 2:  109.5 million views, 98.9 of them in the last

204
00:13:44,605 --> 00:13:48,285
Speaker 2:  two months. That's a 920% increase. This just

205
00:13:48,805 --> 00:13:52,645
Speaker 2:  happened out of nowhere. There were older TikTok videos about the North

206
00:13:52,705 --> 00:13:56,405
Speaker 2:  Sea and scary stuff in general, but they tended to sound like this

207
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:01,805
Speaker 2:  or this,

208
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:07,165
Speaker 2:  oh or this

209
00:14:11,235 --> 00:14:14,925
Speaker 2:  different vibes, am I right? But as the North

210
00:14:15,025 --> 00:14:18,445
Speaker 2:  Sea trend took off, the bass singers became the unofficial

211
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:22,685
Speaker 2:  official soundtrack of North Sea. TikTok TikTok told me there have been more

212
00:14:22,685 --> 00:14:26,525
Speaker 2:  than 130,000 videos using that 62nd clip and

213
00:14:26,525 --> 00:14:30,245
Speaker 2:  that number was from a couple of weeks ago. It's still going up really fast

214
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:34,445
Speaker 2:  for his part. Bobby says he doesn't remember the first time he noticed how

215
00:14:34,455 --> 00:14:37,645
Speaker 2:  hoist the colors was being used, but he definitely didn't see it coming.

216
00:14:38,285 --> 00:14:41,685
Speaker 7:  I had so many friends and family send me these videos where they're like,

217
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:45,125
Speaker 7:  because the sound starts off with my voice and they're like, it's Bobby.

218
00:14:45,265 --> 00:14:46,325
Speaker 7:  And so they send it to me

219
00:14:46,745 --> 00:14:50,565
Speaker 2:  And it turns out that when you blow up on TikTok you tend to blow up

220
00:14:50,565 --> 00:14:51,325
Speaker 2:  elsewhere too.

221
00:14:51,815 --> 00:14:55,685
Speaker 7:  Right now the video is and everywhere streaming is doing like

222
00:14:55,785 --> 00:14:59,605
Speaker 7:  almost quadruple as it normally does, which is really, really

223
00:14:59,605 --> 00:15:00,485
Speaker 7:  great for all of us.

224
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:04,405
Speaker 2:  The song in particular and the North Sea TikTok trend in general

225
00:15:04,965 --> 00:15:08,725
Speaker 2:  actually got so big it became kind of a parody of itself, which honestly

226
00:15:08,805 --> 00:15:12,445
Speaker 2:  I love. There were people like Chris Olsson who were like enough

227
00:15:12,535 --> 00:15:13,285
Speaker 2:  hoist the colors.

228
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:17,445
Speaker 16:  Why is TikTok make me feel like the North Sea is something I should be fearing

229
00:15:17,495 --> 00:15:21,485
Speaker 16:  daily in my everyday life? Like it's a present threat that I'm going to

230
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:22,125
Speaker 16:  somehow end up in

231
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,085
Speaker 2:  The north. And then there were people making fun of the song,

232
00:15:24,545 --> 00:15:24,765
Speaker 17:  Yo

233
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:31,125
Speaker 17:  oh ha hoist, the

234
00:15:31,425 --> 00:15:32,965
Speaker 17:  colors high.

235
00:15:34,235 --> 00:15:38,045
Speaker 2:  That jokey version of hoist the colors itself also has gone kind of viral.

236
00:15:38,275 --> 00:15:42,045
Speaker 2:  It's ridiculous. My favorite one of these videos by the way is just like

237
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:46,085
Speaker 2:  a person in the bathtub slowly splashing the water back and

238
00:15:46,285 --> 00:15:50,245
Speaker 2:  forth while playing that nasally version of the song. It kills me every

239
00:15:50,245 --> 00:15:53,565
Speaker 2:  time. But wait, I've come this far and I have not answered the real question

240
00:15:53,565 --> 00:15:57,325
Speaker 2:  here. Why this song, this version, this clip?

241
00:15:57,705 --> 00:16:01,525
Speaker 2:  The honest truth is it turns out it's a little hard to know when Bobby added

242
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:04,805
Speaker 2:  the song to TikTok to be used as a sound, he didn't pick the

243
00:16:04,855 --> 00:16:08,845
Speaker 2:  62nd clip that everybody now uses and he didn't go in and tag it.

244
00:16:09,095 --> 00:16:13,085
Speaker 2:  Scary and North Sea and big deep bass that

245
00:16:13,085 --> 00:16:17,005
Speaker 2:  makes you feel feelings every time you see it. Somebody just picked that

246
00:16:17,005 --> 00:16:20,925
Speaker 2:  song and made a video and now everybody else does it too. That's just

247
00:16:20,925 --> 00:16:24,765
Speaker 2:  kind of how it happens. But mostly though I think it's just that it

248
00:16:24,835 --> 00:16:28,685
Speaker 2:  fits in a funny way. North Sea TikTok is almost a perfect

249
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:32,645
Speaker 2:  representation of what Bobby says he was originally going for

250
00:16:32,715 --> 00:16:33,405
Speaker 2:  with the song.

251
00:16:34,045 --> 00:16:37,325
Speaker 7:  I wanted this song essentially to sound like

252
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:41,485
Speaker 7:  you've got a giant ship full of mountains just rowing

253
00:16:41,595 --> 00:16:45,245
Speaker 7:  through like treacherous Sea and stuff like that. Just essentially

254
00:16:45,435 --> 00:16:49,045
Speaker 7:  like if earthquakes were singing, I just wanted everyone to like

255
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:53,165
Speaker 7:  feel how much bass you can actually put in something because if

256
00:16:53,165 --> 00:16:56,725
Speaker 7:  you listen to those courses, it's just so full

257
00:16:57,145 --> 00:17:01,125
Speaker 7:  and the bass just cuts so hard and it's just you feel it right in your

258
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:04,885
Speaker 7:  Chest. So having all these big voices to like envelop

259
00:17:04,885 --> 00:17:08,565
Speaker 7:  like just the vastness of the Sea and what's in it because the

260
00:17:08,705 --> 00:17:12,605
Speaker 7:  Sea is big and so we have some big voices to, to add on

261
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:12,885
Speaker 7:  to that

262
00:17:13,555 --> 00:17:16,965
Speaker 2:  Anecdotally, at least on my for you feed North Sea TikTok is

263
00:17:17,765 --> 00:17:21,605
Speaker 2:  starting to slow down a tiny bit, but hoist the colors is showing up

264
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:25,525
Speaker 2:  in all kinds of new places. Now I'm seeing it on those

265
00:17:25,525 --> 00:17:29,165
Speaker 2:  videos that try to test whether you have different phobias, which is

266
00:17:29,165 --> 00:17:33,125
Speaker 2:  horrifying. Some have strange natural phenomenons. Many,

267
00:17:33,235 --> 00:17:36,845
Speaker 2:  many, many videos of monsters that I used to think were fake but

268
00:17:37,025 --> 00:17:40,165
Speaker 2:  don don't know. Those videos are very convincing, all sorts of things

269
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:44,845
Speaker 2:  in every case. The sound does one thing. It increases this feeling

270
00:17:44,945 --> 00:17:48,725
Speaker 2:  of unease like you're headed towards disaster but you have

271
00:17:48,745 --> 00:17:52,525
Speaker 2:  no choice but to accept your fate. You're a deep dark

272
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,525
Speaker 2:  stormy wave crashing basey fate.

273
00:17:58,265 --> 00:18:02,245
Speaker 2:  As for Bobby, he seems to be enjoying the run but is also cognizant of not

274
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:06,125
Speaker 2:  wanting to be the hoist the colors guy or the Sea shanty guy forever.

275
00:18:06,635 --> 00:18:07,125
Speaker 2:  There's

276
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:10,405
Speaker 7:  Always that part of me when I see something's blowing up or if it's around

277
00:18:10,445 --> 00:18:13,845
Speaker 7:  a holiday time and I have a holiday tune that I'm like, I just feel like

278
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:17,405
Speaker 7:  I need to put as much stuff out about this as possible. Like every time

279
00:18:17,785 --> 00:18:21,165
Speaker 7:  it would like reach a new milestone, I would share it, add the sound, and

280
00:18:21,165 --> 00:18:24,565
Speaker 7:  then sometimes we create old videos that we've done to try and like boost

281
00:18:24,585 --> 00:18:28,565
Speaker 7:  it for lack of a better term. Or maybe it's the best term milking it for

282
00:18:28,715 --> 00:18:32,645
Speaker 7:  what it is or what we got. But essentially the next thing

283
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:36,565
Speaker 7:  that is the big question for us and we don't have control

284
00:18:36,595 --> 00:18:39,925
Speaker 7:  over how long a trend will last on TikTok because

285
00:18:40,555 --> 00:18:44,245
Speaker 7:  many people have tried to continue trends, but

286
00:18:44,395 --> 00:18:48,005
Speaker 7:  it's one person cannot do that. It's the mass of people

287
00:18:48,305 --> 00:18:52,045
Speaker 7:  subconsciously decide whether a trend is over or not. So

288
00:18:52,115 --> 00:18:56,085
Speaker 7:  this North Sea trend, much like many before, it will die down at some point,

289
00:18:56,085 --> 00:18:59,005
Speaker 7:  but I'm, I'm really glad that a lot of people are because they're, they're

290
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,365
Speaker 7:  fun videos too. Just watching

291
00:19:01,215 --> 00:19:04,965
Speaker 2:  There will always be a next trend and a next dance craze and

292
00:19:05,075 --> 00:19:08,925
Speaker 2:  Bobby's gonna go find something else entirely to sing about. He's busy

293
00:19:08,925 --> 00:19:12,845
Speaker 2:  right now actually both with the Weatherman's next album and some other projects

294
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:16,645
Speaker 2:  he's working on. But if you wanna post something that scares the heck

295
00:19:16,665 --> 00:19:20,165
Speaker 2:  out of everyone who swipes to it in their feed, you're just not beaten. This

296
00:19:20,165 --> 00:19:21,645
Speaker 2:  one don, don't think it's going anywhere.

297
00:19:22,425 --> 00:19:22,645
Speaker 6:  Yo

298
00:19:26,225 --> 00:19:27,965
Speaker 6:  all hands.

299
00:19:34,585 --> 00:19:37,555
Speaker 2:  Alright, we gotta take a break but when we come back we're gonna talk about

300
00:19:37,735 --> 00:19:41,515
Speaker 2:  the life and death of streaming services in 2024. We'll be

301
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:41,755
Speaker 6:  Right back.

302
00:19:54,745 --> 00:19:55,405
Speaker 6:  Fox Creative.

303
00:19:56,715 --> 00:19:58,645
Speaker 19:  This is advertiser content from Zelle.

304
00:19:59,585 --> 00:20:03,445
Speaker 20:  The recruiter said all I needed to do was send $500 to

305
00:20:03,445 --> 00:20:07,205
Speaker 20:  cover mandatory safety training and the job was mine.

306
00:20:07,745 --> 00:20:11,045
Speaker 19:  In a world where financial crimes are more and more sophisticated,

307
00:20:11,395 --> 00:20:13,005
Speaker 19:  there's a team that's got your back

308
00:20:14,905 --> 00:20:15,125

313
00:20:31,325 --> 00:20:34,765

314
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:35,285
Speaker 21:  job. Scam

00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:43,245
Speaker 18:  your bank call. But that's where we come in. My what?

317
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:46,245

Speaker 22:  No, I won't hold.

319
00:20:51,065 --> 00:20:54,285

339
00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:05,885
Speaker 2:  Welcome back last year was a huge and messy one for the

340
00:22:05,885 --> 00:22:09,245
Speaker 2:  streaming industry. There were strikes, there were huge mergers, there was

341
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:12,765
Speaker 2:  a lot of CEO bickering, there were layoffs, everybody was selling

342
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:16,285
Speaker 2:  everything to everybody and it just all got very complicated and it just

343
00:22:16,285 --> 00:22:19,965
Speaker 2:  seems like this whole industry is trying to figure out what it is

344
00:22:20,665 --> 00:22:24,645
Speaker 2:  and I think 2024 is going to be a lot more of the same. So to

345
00:22:24,645 --> 00:22:28,285
Speaker 2:  preview all of it with me, I brought in Alex, Cranz, Who knows all this stuff

346
00:22:28,665 --> 00:22:32,325
Speaker 2:  and also holds the title of I think the world's last Paramount plus

347
00:22:32,645 --> 00:22:33,525
Speaker 2:  subscriber. Hi Alex.

348
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:34,245
Speaker 23:  Hello.

349
00:22:34,755 --> 00:22:37,245
Speaker 2:  Okay, so here's what we're gonna do. Okay, we're gonna talk about streaming.

350
00:22:37,245 --> 00:22:40,925
Speaker 2:  We talk about streaming a lot. I feel like we need more ways to be

351
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:43,885
Speaker 2:  loudly wrong about the streaming industry. So that's what we're gonna do

352
00:22:43,885 --> 00:22:47,645
Speaker 2:  here. Basically I've set this up, I went through and came up with I think

353
00:22:47,715 --> 00:22:51,365
Speaker 2:  it's either eight or nine of like the streaming services people care about

354
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:55,125
Speaker 2:  and you can quibble whether there should be ones. I don't care. This is the

355
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:59,045
Speaker 2:  list that came up with Here we are. Which is sort of fun. It's like

356
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,405
Speaker 2:  I went through and just wrote down all the ones I could think of. Yeah. And

357
00:23:01,405 --> 00:23:04,165
Speaker 2:  then went and looked at a list and all the other ones were ones that I was

358
00:23:04,165 --> 00:23:06,525
Speaker 2:  like, ah, I don't really care about that. So it worked out well and we're

359
00:23:06,525 --> 00:23:09,725
Speaker 2:  just gonna go through and basically try to figure out if this is going to

360
00:23:09,725 --> 00:23:13,325
Speaker 2:  be a good year or a bad year for that streaming service. So we're just, we're

361
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:17,165
Speaker 2:  just gonna go up and down. No nuance, no scores out of

362
00:23:17,165 --> 00:23:19,765
Speaker 2:  10. It's just good year, bad year. That's all we're doing. Does that sound

363
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:23,645
Speaker 2:  good? I love it. Okay, so we should probably start with Netflix just

364
00:23:23,645 --> 00:23:27,565
Speaker 2:  because Netflix is Netflix. Yeah. And my guess is this is going

365
00:23:27,565 --> 00:23:31,285
Speaker 2:  to be one of the least complicated ones for the two of us to figure out here.

366
00:23:31,505 --> 00:23:34,565
Speaker 2:  What's your sense on what's coming from Netflix in 2024

367
00:23:35,065 --> 00:23:38,325
Speaker 23:  As far as new stuff goes? I think the big one is three Body Problem.

368
00:23:38,715 --> 00:23:42,125
Speaker 23:  There's a lot of weirdness there. I'm both excited about it and terrified

369
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:46,085
Speaker 23:  of it. This is like the second and a half adaptation of this story.

370
00:23:46,475 --> 00:23:50,285
Speaker 23:  It's already been adapted once for TV and it was made into a

371
00:23:50,285 --> 00:23:52,685
Speaker 23:  film by the same people making the Netflix show.

372
00:23:52,945 --> 00:23:54,765
Speaker 2:  It feels like a bad sign that I didn't know that

373
00:23:55,105 --> 00:23:59,045
Speaker 23:  The movie never came out. Oh okay. They shot it in 2015 and were like, nevermind.

374
00:23:59,225 --> 00:24:02,125
Speaker 23:  Oh boy. But we need to make something. So they, that's why the whole Netflix

375
00:24:02,195 --> 00:24:06,045
Speaker 23:  deal happened and like they, they split characters up. Like if you're a

376
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:09,325
Speaker 23:  big loyalist and love the books, there's a lot of confusion going on, but

377
00:24:09,325 --> 00:24:12,045
Speaker 23:  I feel like, like you've got that but then you've got returning stuff like

378
00:24:12,045 --> 00:24:15,925
Speaker 23:  Bridgeton, which I personally am very excited about Bridgeton. I don't know

379
00:24:15,925 --> 00:24:19,405
Speaker 23:  how much of our audience at The Vergecast is, but I'm pumped for it.

380
00:24:19,985 --> 00:24:23,045
Speaker 23:  And it's got the, like the chick from Dairy Girls. Like that is her big

381
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,605
Speaker 23:  moment. It's gonna be great. Love her. There's newer stuff like the the

382
00:24:25,605 --> 00:24:29,565
Speaker 23:  new Michelle Yo show that's on tv. A lot of the reality

383
00:24:29,575 --> 00:24:33,445
Speaker 23:  shows are returning. We're gonna like have this final season of

384
00:24:33,445 --> 00:24:37,045
Speaker 23:  Queer Eye. Oh yeah, that's gonna be just have all of the weird

385
00:24:37,335 --> 00:24:41,245
Speaker 23:  Bobby drama lingering behind it. The drama's probably more

386
00:24:41,485 --> 00:24:45,045
Speaker 23:  interesting than the show itself. Agreed. So I feel like Netflix has got

387
00:24:45,045 --> 00:24:47,725
Speaker 23:  some returning shows that are gonna be really big this year. Stranger Things

388
00:24:47,845 --> 00:24:51,405
Speaker 23:  I don't think is one of 'em. I think that's 2025. Oh I think they're shooting

389
00:24:51,425 --> 00:24:54,445
Speaker 23:  it this year. Okay. And so we're gonna have to wait for Stranger Things,

390
00:24:54,505 --> 00:24:58,165
Speaker 23:  but they've got some other returning shows and this is gonna be the year.

391
00:24:58,165 --> 00:25:01,925
Speaker 23:  Like we find out if, if Netflix is learning anything about how to program

392
00:25:02,295 --> 00:25:05,565
Speaker 23:  their channel and not just throw everything at the wall and see what, see

393
00:25:05,565 --> 00:25:06,005
Speaker 23:  what sticks.

394
00:25:06,345 --> 00:25:09,125
Speaker 2:  But it also seems like don don't know I just, I keep thinking about these

395
00:25:09,565 --> 00:25:12,965
Speaker 2:  like award shows where the guys from Suits come up to present

396
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:16,205
Speaker 2:  awards and everybody's like, oh my God, suits is my favorite show. And it's

397
00:25:16,205 --> 00:25:19,685
Speaker 2:  like Suits is like an old show. Yeah, this is not a new thing but it had

398
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:23,245
Speaker 2:  this new life on Netflix. To me it feels like Netflix is like the most slam

399
00:25:23,275 --> 00:25:26,125
Speaker 2:  dunk winner of 2024. Unless it does something

400
00:25:26,885 --> 00:25:30,725
Speaker 2:  monumentally stupid. It's like the password thing seems

401
00:25:30,725 --> 00:25:34,245
Speaker 2:  to be working, they can just license shows from everybody now because they're

402
00:25:34,245 --> 00:25:37,365
Speaker 2:  the only ones with money. It just seems like it's gonna work.

403
00:25:37,985 --> 00:25:41,365
Speaker 23:  I'm hesitant to call it the winner. Okay. Because I think this is gonna

404
00:25:41,365 --> 00:25:45,045
Speaker 23:  be the year where we start to see a lot of its strategy like

405
00:25:45,485 --> 00:25:48,845
Speaker 23:  solidify and we start to see if audiences actually like that strategy because

406
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:51,485
Speaker 23:  they did a lot of, they made a lot of moves last year and this year they

407
00:25:51,485 --> 00:25:54,485
Speaker 23:  kind of like they, they have a very different programming slate than they've

408
00:25:54,765 --> 00:25:57,965
Speaker 23:  had from years past. And this is the year where we see if that programming

409
00:25:57,965 --> 00:26:01,845
Speaker 23:  slate works. 'cause it's a lot of reality tv which is

410
00:26:01,845 --> 00:26:05,525
Speaker 23:  doing well for Max and has done really well for Netflix. And then it's a

411
00:26:05,525 --> 00:26:09,285
Speaker 23:  lot of like these prestige shows like Three Body Problem. And I could very

412
00:26:09,285 --> 00:26:13,125
Speaker 23:  easily see three Body Problem like Cratering doing

413
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:14,525
Speaker 23:  really, really badly. Yeah,

414
00:26:14,545 --> 00:26:17,965
Speaker 2:  That's an interesting point I think I was going through. So Variety did this

415
00:26:17,965 --> 00:26:21,525
Speaker 2:  list of like the shows people are most excited about this year and Netflix

416
00:26:21,785 --> 00:26:24,725
Speaker 2:  had more of of them than any other service, which is not really surprising

417
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:27,005
Speaker 2:  but you're right. I hadn't really thought about it until you said it, but

418
00:26:27,005 --> 00:26:30,685
Speaker 2:  Netflix is doing like ultra cheap reality stuff and then like ultra

419
00:26:30,685 --> 00:26:33,805
Speaker 2:  expensive prestige culture

420
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:37,525
Speaker 2:  shaping kinds of shows and then nothing in the middle anymore, which used

421
00:26:37,525 --> 00:26:40,125
Speaker 2:  to be where Netflix lived was in the middle, right? Where they're just like,

422
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:42,965
Speaker 2:  here's a hundred shows. Do you like any of them? And they're not doing that

423
00:26:43,005 --> 00:26:43,485
Speaker 2:  at all anymore.

424
00:26:43,555 --> 00:26:45,925
Speaker 23:  They're not doing it. They're, they're relying on suits, they're relying

425
00:26:45,925 --> 00:26:46,125
Speaker 23:  on,

426
00:26:46,195 --> 00:26:47,845
Speaker 2:  They think they can buy those shows now. Yeah,

427
00:26:47,845 --> 00:26:50,725
Speaker 23:  They can buy those shows and I'll be curious to see if that actually works.

428
00:26:50,965 --> 00:26:54,685
Speaker 23:  I would say they're not the winner as much as like the most consistent probably

429
00:26:54,685 --> 00:26:57,925
Speaker 23:  like, like I think they're gonna do well they're not gonna bomb where we're

430
00:26:57,925 --> 00:27:00,525
Speaker 23:  all being like, oh man, Netflix really screwed the pooch this year. But

431
00:27:00,525 --> 00:27:03,285
Speaker 23:  they're not gonna be like, but we're not gonna be like, man Netflix had

432
00:27:03,315 --> 00:27:07,205
Speaker 23:  episode for episode hour for hour. The best streaming service out

433
00:27:07,205 --> 00:27:08,725
Speaker 23:  there. I don't think that's true.

434
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:12,445
Speaker 2:  Okay. But we're still thumbs up on Netflix for 2024. Thumbs

435
00:27:12,445 --> 00:27:13,005
Speaker 23:  Up, thumbs up.

436
00:27:13,225 --> 00:27:16,445
Speaker 2:  All right, I like it. Next one. Disney plus this one I think might be the

437
00:27:16,445 --> 00:27:17,205
Speaker 2:  most complicated.

438
00:27:18,225 --> 00:27:21,045
Speaker 23:  I'm gonna be horrible person to say thumbs down.

439
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:24,365
Speaker 2:  Oh maybe not complicated. I'm also thumbs down on Disney plus. I think this

440
00:27:24,365 --> 00:27:25,925
Speaker 2:  might be a terrible year for Disney plus.

441
00:27:26,275 --> 00:27:29,965
Speaker 23:  Yeah, like Echo just came out, they released all five episodes at once.

442
00:27:30,105 --> 00:27:33,365
Speaker 23:  It was a great show. I really enjoyed it. Like Best Time I've had it Marvel

443
00:27:33,545 --> 00:27:35,405
Speaker 23:  in a while because they didn't have to care about the rest of the Marvel

444
00:27:35,725 --> 00:27:38,725
Speaker 23:  universe to enjoy it. And then they've got Agatha,

445
00:27:39,455 --> 00:27:41,205
Speaker 23:  which is like a spinoff of

446
00:27:41,515 --> 00:27:42,725
Speaker 2:  Wand Visions, right? Yeah,

447
00:27:42,725 --> 00:27:45,645
Speaker 23:  Right. It was a spinoff of Wand Visions that's coming way at the end of

448
00:27:45,645 --> 00:27:49,045
Speaker 23:  the year. And then they've got a Star Wars show. I think they've only got

449
00:27:49,045 --> 00:27:52,845
Speaker 23:  one Star Wars show this year, which is the acolyte, which is set

450
00:27:53,225 --> 00:27:56,685
Speaker 23:  before all the Star Wars stuff. We know. It's basically like we're just

451
00:27:56,685 --> 00:27:59,605
Speaker 23:  gonna tell a cool story about Jedi and that could be really, really cool.

452
00:28:00,105 --> 00:28:03,925
Speaker 23:  But there is a lot of fatigue with dis Disney. Yeah. And it is

453
00:28:03,925 --> 00:28:06,725
Speaker 23:  holding fast and they've held a bunch of shows. There's a bunch of shows

454
00:28:06,725 --> 00:28:10,165
Speaker 23:  like Ironheart that are just getting punted to 2025 'cause they realized

455
00:28:10,165 --> 00:28:12,525
Speaker 23:  they were making bad TV. Daredevil's another one. It was supposed to I think

456
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:16,125
Speaker 23:  come out this year got punted to 2025. So Disney

457
00:28:16,345 --> 00:28:19,845
Speaker 23:  is not in a great place. But there's big

458
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:23,845
Speaker 23:  asterisks because Hulu, which we're also gonna talk about Yep. Is

459
00:28:23,845 --> 00:28:27,565
Speaker 23:  coming into like gonna be a great year for Hulu and at some point

460
00:28:27,565 --> 00:28:30,285
Speaker 23:  it's probably gonna merge with Disney and all of that content will be in

461
00:28:30,285 --> 00:28:33,765
Speaker 23:  one place. So it's like Disney plus bad year

462
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,845
Speaker 23:  asterisk until Hulu gets merged into it.

463
00:28:37,075 --> 00:28:39,645
Speaker 2:  Okay, that's fair. So let's just jump to Hulu 'cause I agree on Disney plus.

464
00:28:39,805 --> 00:28:43,085
Speaker 2:  I think going through the list of stuff people are excited about Disney Plus

465
00:28:43,105 --> 00:28:46,725
Speaker 2:  was kind of alarmingly low and and you're right it's, it's all Marvel and

466
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,685
Speaker 2:  it's all Star Wars and then it's like random cool documentaries

467
00:28:50,685 --> 00:28:54,605
Speaker 2:  that Disney Plus has more of than people think but is still not how you

468
00:28:54,605 --> 00:28:55,845
Speaker 2:  get a thumbs up on this podcast

469
00:28:56,075 --> 00:28:59,165
Speaker 23:  They're doing under the National Geographic brand. They're doing like an

470
00:28:59,165 --> 00:29:02,845
Speaker 23:  adaptation of the story of Martin Luther King and Right. And Malcolm

471
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:06,165
Speaker 23:  X and Cool cast in that. That could be really, really cool. The National

472
00:29:06,165 --> 00:29:09,885
Speaker 23:  Geographic shows are neat, but they're also not winning awards,

473
00:29:10,105 --> 00:29:12,005
Speaker 23:  not starting conversations.

474
00:29:12,395 --> 00:29:14,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah. You don't win the streaming award. The streaming awards with that,

475
00:29:14,865 --> 00:29:18,485
Speaker 2:  I'm sorry to say sorry, but to your point, the The asterisk is a big one

476
00:29:18,485 --> 00:29:22,405
Speaker 2:  because the next one on my list is Hulu. Yeah. Which is kind of a funny thing.

477
00:29:22,515 --> 00:29:26,445
Speaker 2:  Hulu is now like the most reliable dumping

478
00:29:26,445 --> 00:29:30,005
Speaker 2:  ground for stuff on linear television. And it seems like that's

479
00:29:30,325 --> 00:29:33,805
Speaker 2:  just where a lot of that stuff lives. Now we're gonna get to Peacock in a

480
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:37,085
Speaker 2:  minute, but other than the stuff that's on Peacock, Hulu is just gobbling

481
00:29:37,085 --> 00:29:41,045
Speaker 2:  up these shows on broadcast television and on FX and on

482
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:44,285
Speaker 2:  some of these other channels, the people really like Hulu is eventually going

483
00:29:44,285 --> 00:29:47,525
Speaker 2:  to be Disney Plus. Do we think that's this year? Like does Hulu just get

484
00:29:47,525 --> 00:29:50,485
Speaker 2:  wiped off the board Because it's not even gonna be a thing at the end of

485
00:29:50,485 --> 00:29:51,085
Speaker 2:  2024.

486
00:29:51,405 --> 00:29:54,485
Speaker 23:  I see it happening unless there's like weird contract stuff because it's

487
00:29:54,485 --> 00:29:57,725
Speaker 23:  like the exclusive streamer for I believe A, B, C and fx.

488
00:29:58,445 --> 00:30:02,125
Speaker 23:  'cause they're both owned by Disney So. I could see contractual stuff

489
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:04,885
Speaker 23:  meaning it, it happens another year. But I think it's probably gonna happen

490
00:30:04,885 --> 00:30:08,205
Speaker 23:  this year. And the stuff is really good. Like we've got a new season of

491
00:30:08,275 --> 00:30:11,605
Speaker 23:  Feud, which is just gonna be a whole bunch of women in their fifties. Somethings

492
00:30:11,605 --> 00:30:15,405
Speaker 23:  being absolutely horrible to this guy playing Truman Capote and Perfect.

493
00:30:15,645 --> 00:30:19,605
Speaker 23:  I personally like I've wanted nothing more than Calista flock art and

494
00:30:19,895 --> 00:30:23,885
Speaker 23:  Dimmi Moore like being mean to someone on TV together while we're

495
00:30:23,885 --> 00:30:27,725
Speaker 23:  like seventies couture. That sounds great to me personally. But

496
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:30,245
Speaker 23:  you've got old stuff like Grey's Anatomy, which is coming into season

497
00:30:30,265 --> 00:30:33,805
Speaker 23:  2020. I think it's going into season 20 or season

498
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,845
Speaker 23:  19. Yes. Wild. Which is insane.

499
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:39,485
Speaker 2:  I gave up after season two, but I'm, I'm told people still watch Grey's Anatomy

500
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:39,845
Speaker 2:  for couple

501
00:30:39,955 --> 00:30:42,445
Speaker 23:  Time. Oh you gotta watch like season six had a really good episode.

502
00:30:43,955 --> 00:30:46,725
Speaker 23:  Just, you just gotta watch that one episode from that one season. You're

503
00:30:46,725 --> 00:30:48,005
Speaker 23:  fine, you're fine. You'll be all caught up.

504
00:30:48,225 --> 00:30:49,525
Speaker 2:  All right, cool. I'm into it and

505
00:30:49,525 --> 00:30:51,685
Speaker 23:  It's still an old standby. It's still, you're seeing a lot of young people

506
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:55,405
Speaker 23:  watch it. Like I'm seeing it increasingly on my TikTok and like teens.

507
00:30:55,825 --> 00:30:58,445
Speaker 23:  Oh. Ing watching it and getting into it. 'cause they grew up kind of it

508
00:30:58,445 --> 00:31:01,485
Speaker 23:  with it in the background and now they wanna pay attention and they're like,

509
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:04,845
Speaker 23:  oh damn mom, watch this. And like I was five was I allowed to watch this?

510
00:31:05,165 --> 00:31:05,845
Speaker 23:  Shouldn't have been.

511
00:31:05,915 --> 00:31:07,085
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Definitely not. No.

512
00:31:07,145 --> 00:31:09,365
Speaker 23:  And then you've got like 9 1 1, which is another of those kind of shows

513
00:31:09,365 --> 00:31:12,805
Speaker 23:  where like I can just put that on and do my laundry and have a good time.

514
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:16,925
Speaker 23:  And that's personally the kind of stuff I want. Yeah. I feel like there's

515
00:31:16,925 --> 00:31:19,525
Speaker 23:  a bunch of stuff coming to Hulu this year that's gonna be really, really

516
00:31:19,525 --> 00:31:19,725
Speaker 23:  good.

517
00:31:20,115 --> 00:31:24,085
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I think that's right. Hulu doesn't seem to have the one kind

518
00:31:24,085 --> 00:31:27,725
Speaker 2:  of giant thing everybody is hoping for. Like maybe season two of Feud

519
00:31:27,985 --> 00:31:31,885
Speaker 2:  is that that kind of penetrates into this is the show everybody is

520
00:31:31,885 --> 00:31:35,085
Speaker 2:  talking about, but that's never really been Hulu's thing. Right. Hulu's thing

521
00:31:35,105 --> 00:31:38,885
Speaker 2:  is is it's the place you go to watch the shows. You

522
00:31:38,885 --> 00:31:42,805
Speaker 2:  kind of like Yeah. Guiltily and don't really tell anybody about like that's,

523
00:31:42,805 --> 00:31:45,045
Speaker 2:  that's Hulu's thing and it's a very good thing and

524
00:31:45,045 --> 00:31:48,765
Speaker 23:  It is. And it's benefiting from the fact that it's got all of the FX content

525
00:31:48,985 --> 00:31:52,805
Speaker 23:  and FX is still like making TV in a way that a lot of

526
00:31:52,805 --> 00:31:56,725
Speaker 23:  other of those like basic cable channels stopped doing. Yeah. FX is still

527
00:31:56,725 --> 00:31:58,605
Speaker 23:  doing it. Which is why you're getting Feuded. Which is why you're getting

528
00:31:59,065 --> 00:32:02,565
Speaker 23:  Shogun, which is a remake of a Richard Chamberlain

529
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:06,805
Speaker 23:  like miniseries from the eighties Okay. That they're doing. And I keep

530
00:32:06,805 --> 00:32:09,525
Speaker 23:  seeing it everywhere and I like the cast in it. So I'm like, all right,

531
00:32:09,715 --> 00:32:13,445
Speaker 23:  I'll watch this. even that the original was boring as hell, but like

532
00:32:13,705 --> 00:32:16,645
Speaker 23:  FX is really thoughtful about programming and I think we're gonna see that

533
00:32:16,705 --> 00:32:20,685
Speaker 23:  in Hulu and and they're gonna benefit from that in a way that Netflix just

534
00:32:20,995 --> 00:32:22,765
Speaker 23:  doesn't have that, those chops.

535
00:32:23,115 --> 00:32:26,885
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I mean I, funny enough, I think Hulu is probably a thumbs up for this

536
00:32:26,885 --> 00:32:30,765
Speaker 2:  year and I think the extent to which it is a thumbs up, I think

537
00:32:30,765 --> 00:32:34,125
Speaker 2:  you're right, will probably determine whether Disney Plus is a thumbs up

538
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:37,405
Speaker 2:  or not. Like yeah, Hulu feels very important to Disney this year because

539
00:32:37,405 --> 00:32:41,245
Speaker 2:  Disney otherwise is in kind of a weird place where it's so reliant

540
00:32:41,545 --> 00:32:44,125
Speaker 2:  on just a couple of things like we've been talking about. But Hulu is the

541
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:47,005
Speaker 2:  one where they're just like, we just have this sort of giant slate of cool

542
00:32:47,005 --> 00:32:50,285
Speaker 2:  stuff that a lot of people like and Disney is like, dear God we need that.

543
00:32:50,285 --> 00:32:53,125
Speaker 2:  Because if we keep making Marvel stuff people will leave.

544
00:32:53,545 --> 00:32:57,045
Speaker 23:  Yes. I mean I'll watch Marvel too, but I wanna mix it up. Yeah,

545
00:32:57,285 --> 00:33:00,725
Speaker 2:  A hundred percent. Alright, so we're thumbs up for Hulu but it is, I would

546
00:33:00,725 --> 00:33:03,565
Speaker 2:  say possible that we will not get to give Hulu a score at the end of the

547
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,045
Speaker 2:  year because it will just be part of Disney plus.

548
00:33:05,315 --> 00:33:06,685
Speaker 23:  Yeah. Asterisk. Yeah,

549
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:10,405
Speaker 2:  Exactly. Alright, next up Max, which to me Max

550
00:33:10,505 --> 00:33:14,405
Speaker 2:  is the most split between, there's a content story

551
00:33:14,545 --> 00:33:18,485
Speaker 2:  and there's a corporate story and they are complete opposites of each other,

552
00:33:18,535 --> 00:33:22,485
Speaker 2:  which has made me very torn on how to rule on this company this year.

553
00:33:22,485 --> 00:33:23,045
Speaker 2:  What do you think?

554
00:33:23,465 --> 00:33:26,525
Speaker 23:  The content story is good, right? Yeah. Like the content story is good.

555
00:33:26,525 --> 00:33:29,205
Speaker 23:  You've got all of this stuff. I personally don't watch a lot of reality

556
00:33:29,305 --> 00:33:31,445
Speaker 23:  tv but everybody knows David loves it. I do

557
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:35,165
Speaker 2:  Just HGTV forever. I'm fine with it. There's a new kid's baking championship

558
00:33:35,165 --> 00:33:36,925
Speaker 2:  on Max right now. It's very exciting. Yeah,

559
00:33:37,105 --> 00:33:40,845
Speaker 23:  My sister-in-Law loves the Naked Dating Show. Like oh yeah, we had to watch

560
00:33:40,905 --> 00:33:42,565
Speaker 23:  so much of it at Christmas. But

561
00:33:42,835 --> 00:33:44,925
Speaker 2:  Cool. Family friendly show it seems like. Yeah,

562
00:33:45,165 --> 00:33:48,165
Speaker 23:  It's great. It's great. I love that. Watching that with the mom but real

563
00:33:48,165 --> 00:33:51,325
Speaker 23:  like they've got good stuff Mac Max the content wise, they've got something

564
00:33:51,325 --> 00:33:54,085
Speaker 23:  that's hitting every one of those markets, right? It's hitting the people

565
00:33:54,105 --> 00:33:58,005
Speaker 23:  who just wanna go and you know, you can watch friends and and do your laundry,

566
00:33:58,225 --> 00:34:02,165
Speaker 23:  you can watch reality TV shows and you've got your big prestige stuff

567
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:06,085
Speaker 23:  and it's got a lot of prestige stuff coming this year. A new season of House

568
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:09,525
Speaker 23:  of the Dragons, I think the Last of Us isn't until 2025. I think that's

569
00:34:09,525 --> 00:34:12,405
Speaker 23:  another one. Oh yeah, they're just casting it now. So I think that's getting

570
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:16,365
Speaker 23:  punted but But there's a bunch of stuff that's gonna be coming from by benefit

571
00:34:16,465 --> 00:34:18,085
Speaker 23:  of having HBO. Yeah.

572
00:34:18,085 --> 00:34:19,805
Speaker 2:  There's like a dune show coming this year.

573
00:34:19,945 --> 00:34:21,085
Speaker 23:  That's right. There's

574
00:34:21,085 --> 00:34:23,965
Speaker 2:  A true detective already started. Have you watched the First of the New True

575
00:34:23,965 --> 00:34:24,405
Speaker 2:  Detectives?

576
00:34:24,475 --> 00:34:27,205
Speaker 23:  True Detective is one of my favorite shows of the year so far. Like I've

577
00:34:27,205 --> 00:34:30,685
Speaker 23:  watched all of it. You ha I think I'm only allowed to say it's really good.

578
00:34:30,965 --> 00:34:33,645
Speaker 23:  I really like it. I think people are gonna really like it. It's, it's a

579
00:34:33,645 --> 00:34:33,925
Speaker 23:  fun time.

580
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:36,685
Speaker 2:  I have not watched it yet, but I promise I will catch up by the time we do

581
00:34:36,685 --> 00:34:37,525
Speaker 2:  this again so we can talk about

582
00:34:37,525 --> 00:34:40,205
Speaker 23:  It. Yeah, you've just got the rest of the year. Exactly. It'll be fun. But

583
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:42,925
Speaker 23:  yeah, I, I think, I think they've got really, really good taunt there. I

584
00:34:42,925 --> 00:34:44,965
Speaker 23:  think they're still struggling with their, their user interface and I think

585
00:34:45,405 --> 00:34:48,005
Speaker 23:  honestly for me that's gonna be the big story of the year is if people get

586
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:51,525
Speaker 23:  their user interfaces like in a place that's usable consistently,

587
00:34:51,835 --> 00:34:55,645
Speaker 23:  they're one of the worst at it. Yes. Right now they're slowly improving,

588
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:59,125
Speaker 23:  but we'll see. They're, they're doing a lot more sports this year. I know.

589
00:34:59,425 --> 00:35:02,565
Speaker 23:  And we'll curious to see how that goes for them. You know, the sports side

590
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,365
Speaker 23:  better than I do. Well they've been

591
00:35:04,365 --> 00:35:07,965
Speaker 2:  Kind of delaying this in a weird way. Like Bleacher Report is part of

592
00:35:08,185 --> 00:35:11,645
Speaker 2:  Max, it's its own, you know, tab in the app, which makes you think it's a

593
00:35:11,645 --> 00:35:14,445
Speaker 2:  big deal. It's right there on the road with HBO and it was supposed to be

594
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,965
Speaker 2:  kind of an add-on with a lot of stuff and they've kind of delayed that and

595
00:35:17,965 --> 00:35:21,725
Speaker 2:  delayed it and it's not super clear what that's gonna look like yet

596
00:35:22,025 --> 00:35:25,565
Speaker 2:  or whether it's gonna really work, but obviously Warner Brothers Discovery

597
00:35:25,865 --> 00:35:29,525
Speaker 2:  has rights to lots of NBA games and lots of other sports. So it,

598
00:35:29,575 --> 00:35:33,085
Speaker 2:  it'll, I would assume it'll start to happen 'cause that is the plan. But,

599
00:35:33,345 --> 00:35:36,605
Speaker 2:  and this is the corporate story, Warner Brothers Discovery, the company that

600
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:40,485
Speaker 2:  owns Max seems to be less and less invested in the idea

601
00:35:40,545 --> 00:35:44,485
Speaker 2:  of Max as like the future of the company. David dlo has been

602
00:35:44,485 --> 00:35:46,885
Speaker 2:  talking about this all the time. They're back to, they're big on theaters,

603
00:35:46,885 --> 00:35:50,325
Speaker 2:  they're back to selling content to other streamers. Like I'm not confident

604
00:35:50,325 --> 00:35:53,645
Speaker 2:  that this company caress a lot about Max anymore.

605
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:57,325
Speaker 23:  The other side of the content story is we're seeing a lot of stuff that's

606
00:35:57,325 --> 00:36:01,125
Speaker 23:  gonna come that was made for hbo. Yeah. Not for Max. There's only about

607
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:04,645
Speaker 23:  like, there's only a couple of shows that are exclusively Max that are still

608
00:36:04,645 --> 00:36:08,205
Speaker 23:  around Harley Quinn hacks and I think the Secret

609
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:12,565
Speaker 23:  Sex Lives of College Girls, right. That show is, is if not ending

610
00:36:12,585 --> 00:36:16,445
Speaker 23:  is gonna be in a bad place, it's Big Star Renee Rap is leaving Hacks,

611
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:20,405
Speaker 23:  this is its third season and I think it's pretty probably done. Harley

612
00:36:20,485 --> 00:36:23,765
Speaker 23:  Quinn is probably gonna be the only one of those like Max Originals that

613
00:36:24,005 --> 00:36:27,605
Speaker 23:  survives a very long time. It's doing well. Everybody likes it critically

614
00:36:27,605 --> 00:36:30,285
Speaker 23:  acclaimed and it's gonna just keep going. You

615
00:36:30,285 --> 00:36:33,125
Speaker 2:  Can always gritty reboot Batman. That's what we've always learned, right.

616
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:35,765
Speaker 2:  Nitty gritty reboot of a Batman show is gonna do just fine. You're gonna

617
00:36:35,765 --> 00:36:36,325
Speaker 2:  be all right. Yeah.

618
00:36:36,325 --> 00:36:40,205
Speaker 23:  Just redo it and you're good to go. But as far as like its other big stuff.

619
00:36:40,305 --> 00:36:44,005
Speaker 23:  All the other programming is really dependent on, on its, its linear channels.

620
00:36:44,005 --> 00:36:47,965
Speaker 23:  Yeah. And and and pulling it from there. So like the regime and House of

621
00:36:47,965 --> 00:36:51,685
Speaker 23:  the Dragons, those are all HBO first shows. So

622
00:36:51,945 --> 00:36:55,325
Speaker 23:  I'm curious to see what happens with Max don. Don't think it goes away entirely.

623
00:36:55,565 --> 00:36:59,405
Speaker 23:  I think it sticks around, but I think like that moment we had where Max

624
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,885
Speaker 23:  was the best streaming service, I think that's done.

625
00:37:02,035 --> 00:37:04,885
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I, it's gonna be so interesting to see if we get to the end of this

626
00:37:04,885 --> 00:37:08,325
Speaker 2:  year, Warner Brothers Discovery still has a ton of debt, is still kind of

627
00:37:08,325 --> 00:37:12,285
Speaker 2:  hemorrhaging money trying to make all of this work. And it's gonna get

628
00:37:12,285 --> 00:37:16,005
Speaker 2:  to a point where either David Zaslav and the rest of the executives there

629
00:37:16,005 --> 00:37:18,525
Speaker 2:  are gonna have to just like hold their nose and say, we believe Max is the

630
00:37:18,525 --> 00:37:22,445
Speaker 2:  future we are all in. Even if it gets us fired and runs outta of business.

631
00:37:22,905 --> 00:37:26,485
Speaker 2:  Or they're gonna say, you know, nevermind, let's have this be a nice thing

632
00:37:26,485 --> 00:37:30,365
Speaker 2:  on the side, but not worry too much about it.

633
00:37:30,365 --> 00:37:32,805
Speaker 2:  And we're gonna go back to mostly being a place that makes things and sells

634
00:37:32,805 --> 00:37:35,885
Speaker 2:  it to other people. And if you do that, yeah, you're not gonna beat Netflix.

635
00:37:36,155 --> 00:37:39,325
Speaker 2:  It's just, I just don't see it happening. Like I'm a very light thumbs down

636
00:37:39,345 --> 00:37:43,085
Speaker 2:  on Max for that reason because I just don't believe it's, they, they have

637
00:37:43,085 --> 00:37:45,565
Speaker 2:  not burned the boats on streaming, you know what I mean? Well

638
00:37:45,565 --> 00:37:48,445
Speaker 23:  They put all their films, all their films are on Netflix now. Right, right.

639
00:37:48,445 --> 00:37:50,485
Speaker 23:  Like that's who they sold all their films to. And that's

640
00:37:50,485 --> 00:37:54,445
Speaker 2:  A fine and good thing and more companies should do that, but that's not

641
00:37:54,445 --> 00:37:55,445
Speaker 2:  how you make Max win.

642
00:37:55,755 --> 00:37:59,605
Speaker 23:  Yeah. Max, I think I'm a little thumbs up. Okay. Just because

643
00:38:00,065 --> 00:38:03,725
Speaker 23:  it does have so much content and it is pro it's gonna stick around,

644
00:38:04,385 --> 00:38:07,965
Speaker 23:  but I see like I can see 2025 being thumbs down on it. Okay. But

645
00:38:07,965 --> 00:38:11,445
Speaker 23:  2024 I'm still like shaky thumbs up. Alright,

646
00:38:11,445 --> 00:38:14,605
Speaker 2:  That's good. This is the, we we disagree. This is good. Yeah. And next up,

647
00:38:14,605 --> 00:38:17,125
Speaker 2:  this is, I just switched the order around because this actually matters a

648
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:21,045
Speaker 2:  lot both to its own story and to the Max story is Paramount Plus,

649
00:38:21,135 --> 00:38:24,645
Speaker 2:  which there are rumors flying that Paramount plus

650
00:38:25,225 --> 00:38:29,085
Speaker 2:  may someday not be a thing and be a part of Max. There's rumors that

651
00:38:29,425 --> 00:38:32,845
Speaker 2:  Warner Brothers Discovery or someone else is very interested in buying

652
00:38:33,195 --> 00:38:36,525
Speaker 2:  Paramount Global or National Amusements. The corporate intrigue is

653
00:38:36,755 --> 00:38:40,565
Speaker 2:  confusing and strange, but none of it seems to end in Paramount

654
00:38:40,565 --> 00:38:42,525
Speaker 2:  plus being a going concern for much longer.

655
00:38:43,105 --> 00:38:45,685
Speaker 23:  See I am probably the most bullish on Paramount plus

656
00:38:46,205 --> 00:38:49,365
Speaker 2:  I a hundred percent believe that you may be the only person left. I said

657
00:38:49,365 --> 00:38:52,165
Speaker 2:  in the intro, you may be the only person left on Paramount Plus at the end

658
00:38:52,165 --> 00:38:52,445
Speaker 2:  of this.

659
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:57,085
Speaker 23:  I think that of all of the big streaming companies, it is the most

660
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,925
Speaker 23:  thoughtful. It's been doing it as long as anybody. Right. Like it originally

661
00:38:59,925 --> 00:39:03,285
Speaker 23:  started as CBS all Access, it was doing it before Max. And, and a lot of

662
00:39:03,285 --> 00:39:06,765
Speaker 23:  these other companies thought about doing this, this strategy and it's been

663
00:39:06,765 --> 00:39:10,685
Speaker 23:  a slow and steady like winner. And they, they already knew the advertising

664
00:39:10,845 --> 00:39:14,645
Speaker 23:  business. They were, they were serving ads before anybody else and and doing

665
00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:17,645
Speaker 23:  well with it. They're, they're doing sports before anybody else and doing

666
00:39:17,645 --> 00:39:21,325
Speaker 23:  well with it. They were live streaming before. Like Max still

667
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,165
Speaker 23:  struggles with live streaming and Paramount Plus has been doing it for a

668
00:39:24,165 --> 00:39:27,405
Speaker 23:  while. Tech Stack wise, they're in a really good position content wise.

669
00:39:27,595 --> 00:39:30,965
Speaker 23:  They have like solid content that's that's makes them money. Right. You've

670
00:39:30,965 --> 00:39:34,325
Speaker 23:  got the Star Trek stuff that nobody talks about, but you've got Star Trek.

671
00:39:34,325 --> 00:39:37,205
Speaker 2:  But people do seem to watch, I will say I have heard, I have heard enough

672
00:39:37,205 --> 00:39:40,885
Speaker 2:  people say I love the Star Trek shows. Why does nobody talk about it? That

673
00:39:40,885 --> 00:39:44,525
Speaker 2:  it has kind of entered the, actually people do talk about it category, it's

674
00:39:44,525 --> 00:39:45,565
Speaker 2:  kind of a little bit of a thing.

675
00:39:45,665 --> 00:39:49,125
Speaker 23:  You've got all the Taylor Sheridan stuff that's also happening. Sure. You've

676
00:39:49,365 --> 00:39:52,325
Speaker 23:  got, this is probably just for me and the three other people that have been

677
00:39:52,605 --> 00:39:56,165
Speaker 23:  subscribing to Paramount Plus since it was CVS All Access, but Elspeth,

678
00:39:56,165 --> 00:39:59,845
Speaker 23:  which is gonna be the second spinoff of The Good Wife. Oh.

679
00:40:00,225 --> 00:40:03,405
Speaker 23:  So we've got that coming A new season of Evil, which is from the same like

680
00:40:03,595 --> 00:40:03,885
Speaker 23:  team

681
00:40:04,365 --> 00:40:07,845
Speaker 2:  I will say Evil is great. I make a lot of fun of Paramount Plus Evil is Great.

682
00:40:08,425 --> 00:40:09,445
Speaker 23:  Legits such a good show.

683
00:40:09,755 --> 00:40:11,605
Speaker 2:  It's so weird in the best possible way.

684
00:40:11,745 --> 00:40:15,605
Speaker 23:  And then I assume there's another NCIS just because every

685
00:40:15,605 --> 00:40:19,525
Speaker 23:  year there's another NCIS Yeah. And people watch that. I don't

686
00:40:19,525 --> 00:40:23,365
Speaker 23:  watch it. So many people watch it though. So I like I

687
00:40:23,445 --> 00:40:27,405
Speaker 23:  I am kind of bullish on it because they didn't stop yet.

688
00:40:27,505 --> 00:40:31,405
Speaker 23:  So why would they suddenly stop now just to be acquired? Like this is a

689
00:40:31,405 --> 00:40:34,525
Speaker 23:  company that's owned by primarily a single person. It's got one big

690
00:40:34,755 --> 00:40:38,605
Speaker 23:  stockholder and it's been owned by this family for a fairly decent amount

691
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:41,965
Speaker 23:  of time. And yeah, she might wanna say, okay, I'm gonna check out, but I

692
00:40:42,055 --> 00:40:45,685
Speaker 23:  can't see her just wanting to go and be part of like the Max

693
00:40:45,685 --> 00:40:49,245
Speaker 23:  amalgamation. Right. Like, like that's fair. And a lot of that stuff we

694
00:40:49,245 --> 00:40:51,965
Speaker 23:  heard where Warner Brothers Discovery was thinking about buying it and kicking

695
00:40:51,985 --> 00:40:55,885
Speaker 23:  the tires that has since disappeared. We've heard quiet there could still

696
00:40:55,885 --> 00:40:59,125
Speaker 23:  happen. I'm not gonna say it's not gonna happen. I'll just be really, really

697
00:40:59,235 --> 00:41:03,005
Speaker 23:  surprised. But I think it's just kinda like these are the, it's still

698
00:41:03,025 --> 00:41:06,525
Speaker 23:  the whole same crew that had the number one network on

699
00:41:06,525 --> 00:41:10,445
Speaker 23:  television for like a bajillion years. Yeah. They know how to do that

700
00:41:10,475 --> 00:41:13,685
Speaker 23:  once. And I think they're starting to figure streaming out better. And I

701
00:41:13,685 --> 00:41:17,125
Speaker 23:  don't think they're ever gonna be Netflix, but I think they're gonna still

702
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:20,045
Speaker 23:  persist. I could see them being very comfortable with being in fourth place

703
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:21,285
Speaker 23:  if they can get there.

704
00:41:21,915 --> 00:41:25,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah, no, IIII totally buy that logic. I'm still thumbs down on

705
00:41:25,685 --> 00:41:29,525
Speaker 2:  Paramount Plus I think it's fair as a bundle of content, I think

706
00:41:29,525 --> 00:41:33,405
Speaker 2:  Paramount Plus is gonna make for a giant thumbs up on Peacock

707
00:41:33,505 --> 00:41:37,285
Speaker 2:  or HB or Max or wherever it ends up. I just don't

708
00:41:37,335 --> 00:41:41,245
Speaker 2:  think this company is going to stay interested in

709
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:44,045
Speaker 2:  having its own streaming service. Like I just don't know what fourth place

710
00:41:44,045 --> 00:41:45,965
Speaker 2:  gets you at this point anymore. No,

711
00:41:45,965 --> 00:41:49,725
Speaker 23:  It, I that's, that's the thing is that're comfortable with it because it

712
00:41:49,725 --> 00:41:52,525
Speaker 23:  gets them monthly. Like it just gets them additional revenue. Well

713
00:41:52,525 --> 00:41:55,485
Speaker 2:  Sure it makes Sherry Redstone rich, which is something that's that's fair.

714
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:59,365
Speaker 23:  Yeah. Like, like they're still making money off of it. They weren't as kind

715
00:41:59,365 --> 00:42:02,965
Speaker 23:  of a victim of zero interest rates as a lot of other people. A lot of people

716
00:42:03,065 --> 00:42:05,685
Speaker 23:  put a lot of money into that. Yeah. And they certainly did too. There was

717
00:42:05,685 --> 00:42:09,605
Speaker 23:  the, the Grease prequel, which me and one other person watched and we

718
00:42:09,605 --> 00:42:13,525
Speaker 23:  had a great time. But that was a dumb move to ever make that show.

719
00:42:13,525 --> 00:42:17,365
Speaker 23:  Correct. Why did you do that? And they, they have fewer

720
00:42:17,365 --> 00:42:20,485
Speaker 23:  of those misses. Yeah. Like they, they generally are much more

721
00:42:21,115 --> 00:42:23,765
Speaker 23:  bullish on the shows they do have and those shows and they're much more

722
00:42:23,765 --> 00:42:26,445
Speaker 23:  thoughtful about how they spend money on stuff. They're not throwing money

723
00:42:26,445 --> 00:42:26,725
Speaker 23:  around.

724
00:42:27,195 --> 00:42:31,165
Speaker 2:  That is true Paramount. Plus there's a good case to be made and you're

725
00:42:31,165 --> 00:42:34,525
Speaker 2:  making me rethink my thumbs down that Paramount Plus is like the cockroach

726
00:42:34,525 --> 00:42:36,685
Speaker 2:  of the streaming industry. It's like it's never gonna win, but it's also

727
00:42:36,685 --> 00:42:40,645
Speaker 2:  never gonna die. Yes. They're not doing the big swings that

728
00:42:40,835 --> 00:42:44,645
Speaker 2:  make you Netflix, but they're also not doing the dumb things that kill your

729
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:48,125
Speaker 2:  streaming service. So. I think that, I think that's fair. I still think they're

730
00:42:48,125 --> 00:42:51,605
Speaker 2:  more likely to get bought this year than not. So I'm sticking with my thumbs

731
00:42:51,605 --> 00:42:54,885
Speaker 2:  down. But you, you make a convincing case and I, I sort of hope I'm wrong

732
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:55,845
Speaker 2:  for your sake.

733
00:42:56,225 --> 00:43:00,085
Speaker 23:  See, I would've, until last week, I would've said, it's not gonna be them.

734
00:43:00,115 --> 00:43:04,085
Speaker 23:  It's gonna be Peacock and then Peacock. If you wanna move on to

735
00:43:04,085 --> 00:43:07,405
Speaker 23:  Peacock, let's do it. Peacock just absolutely crushed it with sports. Right?

736
00:43:07,435 --> 00:43:10,645
Speaker 23:  Like they kept one of the biggest streaming moments ever in the history

737
00:43:10,645 --> 00:43:12,205
Speaker 23:  of the world. And so it's like, oh damn.

738
00:43:12,385 --> 00:43:16,325
Speaker 2:  And it worked. They had like, what was it, 23 million people watched

739
00:43:16,785 --> 00:43:18,405
Speaker 2:  the playoff game on, on Peacock

740
00:43:18,815 --> 00:43:22,085
Speaker 23:  Still less than who watched Mash season finale. But,

741
00:43:22,345 --> 00:43:26,085
Speaker 2:  But still the fact that that many people watched it and it worked and people

742
00:43:26,085 --> 00:43:29,525
Speaker 2:  were happy. It's like that's a big win for streaming in general, I think.

743
00:43:30,025 --> 00:43:34,005
Speaker 23:  And can Peacock parlay that into long-term success

744
00:43:34,785 --> 00:43:38,605
Speaker 23:  is anybody's guess? Agreed. I would generally say no

745
00:43:39,155 --> 00:43:42,485
Speaker 23:  because otherwise when you think about their, their, their scripted programming,

746
00:43:42,485 --> 00:43:46,445
Speaker 23:  it's not very good when you think about their scripted

747
00:43:46,445 --> 00:43:50,045
Speaker 23:  programming that's not sports. It's not very good. It's all, first of

748
00:43:50,045 --> 00:43:53,565
Speaker 2:  All, that's, that is Twisted Metal erasure and I will not stand for it. Sorry.

749
00:43:53,565 --> 00:43:57,125
Speaker 2:  Twisted Metal is the best terrible show I watched in 2023.

750
00:43:57,795 --> 00:43:59,965
Speaker 23:  More people watch that than Paramount Plus. Yeah.

751
00:44:01,745 --> 00:44:05,605
Speaker 23:  But they've got sports going for them. Yeah. And maybe, maybe that's,

752
00:44:05,605 --> 00:44:09,125
Speaker 23:  that has been enough for many channels, including ESPN for pretty years.

753
00:44:09,505 --> 00:44:13,485
Speaker 23:  So I don't wanna knock it for that, but I, I was kind of blown away by that

754
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:16,605
Speaker 23:  and I'm still processing the fact that Peacock had a win because I I was

755
00:44:16,605 --> 00:44:20,445
Speaker 23:  ready. It was, it was at, it was at a 90 on my go. 90. I was like,

756
00:44:20,545 --> 00:44:24,245
Speaker 23:  the fact that it isn't getting snapped up by Max right now shocked me

757
00:44:24,425 --> 00:44:26,365
Speaker 23:  and I still think it could happen. Yeah.

758
00:44:26,425 --> 00:44:30,205
Speaker 2:  It it, I mean there there is an interesting thing of, you have,

759
00:44:30,265 --> 00:44:33,765
Speaker 2:  you have Max, you have Paramount Plus and you have Peacock and

760
00:44:34,325 --> 00:44:38,085
Speaker 2:  I would be absolutely shocked if all three of those are three

761
00:44:38,285 --> 00:44:42,045
Speaker 2:  separate companies at the end of 2024. Yeah. Who

762
00:44:42,045 --> 00:44:44,965
Speaker 2:  buys like, it's there, there have been lots of rumors that Comcast, which

763
00:44:45,035 --> 00:44:48,765
Speaker 2:  owns NBC Universal and I guess disclosure is a n BBC Universal is a, an

764
00:44:49,165 --> 00:44:52,845
Speaker 2:  investor in Vox Media. We make a Netflix show. It's pretty good. Alex

765
00:44:52,855 --> 00:44:54,805
Speaker 2:  loves Paramount Plus there's all of our

766
00:44:54,805 --> 00:44:56,085
Speaker 23:  Displays I subscribed to Paramount Plus

767
00:44:57,235 --> 00:45:00,765
Speaker 2:  There's been some rumors that Comcast is interested in buying Paramount Plus,

768
00:45:00,765 --> 00:45:03,605
Speaker 2:  which I think is directly to solve what you're talking about, which is that

769
00:45:03,995 --> 00:45:07,765
Speaker 2:  Peacock has rights to really cool things and just doesn't

770
00:45:07,765 --> 00:45:11,125
Speaker 2:  seem to be able to make a show that breaks through to save its life. Like

771
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,845
Speaker 2:  Poker Face was the closest it got, but when was the last time you talked

772
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:15,325
Speaker 2:  about Poker Face? You know what I mean? It

773
00:45:15,325 --> 00:45:15,965
Speaker 23:  Went on an Emmy.

774
00:45:16,105 --> 00:45:18,845
Speaker 2:  It did. And it's a great show. People should watch it. It's, but it's Peacock

775
00:45:18,845 --> 00:45:22,405
Speaker 2:  has not broken through yet. Yeah, it has, it has lots of like singles and

776
00:45:22,405 --> 00:45:25,605
Speaker 2:  doubles, but it has not had sort of the giant wind that you need.

777
00:45:25,675 --> 00:45:28,645
Speaker 23:  Paramount Plus had Emmys like five years ago. Yeah.

778
00:45:28,655 --> 00:45:32,125
Speaker 2:  Right. Like I'm sure CBS All Access was out here winning awards. Like that's

779
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:32,645
Speaker 2:  not how you get here.

780
00:45:32,785 --> 00:45:34,365
Speaker 23:  The good Fight baby. The good fight.

781
00:45:34,585 --> 00:45:37,245
Speaker 2:  But yeah. And then so there's been rumors that, you know, Warner Brothers

782
00:45:37,245 --> 00:45:40,325
Speaker 2:  Discovery, which owns Max might be in acquisition mode. Paramount Plus might

783
00:45:40,325 --> 00:45:44,045
Speaker 2:  be selling to everybody. So I, think there's some mix of

784
00:45:44,175 --> 00:45:47,965
Speaker 2:  stuff there that just seems like it's gonna get

785
00:45:48,065 --> 00:45:51,125
Speaker 2:  sorted out over the next 12 months. Yeah, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna thumbs

786
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:54,885
Speaker 2:  up on Peacock just because personally it's very important to me as the place

787
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:57,965
Speaker 2:  where I watch the Office and Parks and Recreation and Brooklyn Nine nine,

788
00:45:58,425 --> 00:46:02,325
Speaker 2:  but also because Comcast just seems to have gone

789
00:46:02,465 --> 00:46:05,885
Speaker 2:  all in on this. Like in the way that I don't see Warner's, Warner Brothers

790
00:46:05,885 --> 00:46:09,725
Speaker 2:  Discovery saying we need streaming to work. Comcast is saying we

791
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:12,445
Speaker 2:  need streaming to work. Yeah. And it might kill it in the long run, but I

792
00:46:12,445 --> 00:46:15,805
Speaker 2:  don't think it kills it this year. I think Comcast is more likely to be a

793
00:46:15,805 --> 00:46:17,725
Speaker 2:  buyer than a seller this year, as far as I can tell.

794
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:21,485
Speaker 23:  Yeah, that's, that's right. Comcast is facing an existential crisis

795
00:46:21,835 --> 00:46:25,445
Speaker 23:  because everybody's stopping. And, and the same thing with, with Paramount,

796
00:46:25,525 --> 00:46:29,405
Speaker 23:  a lot of these people who are highly dependent on broadcast TV and basic

797
00:46:29,415 --> 00:46:33,045
Speaker 23:  cable are facing an existential crisis of what do we do next? We need a

798
00:46:33,045 --> 00:46:36,165
Speaker 23:  good streaming service. Yep. And so they're gonna be very, very motivated

799
00:46:36,165 --> 00:46:40,085
Speaker 23:  in a way that Max and Netflix and some of these other, like the tech

800
00:46:40,085 --> 00:46:43,485
Speaker 23:  focused, more tech oriented streaming services don't have to be.

801
00:46:43,715 --> 00:46:45,965
Speaker 2:  Totally All right, so Peacock thumbs up or thumbs down?

802
00:46:46,305 --> 00:46:50,245
Speaker 23:  Ugh, thumbs up. But it's like, I'm shocked to

803
00:46:50,245 --> 00:46:50,565
Speaker 23:  do that.

804
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:52,365
Speaker 2:  Okay.

805
00:46:52,795 --> 00:46:54,805
Speaker 23:  It's all, it's all the sports. It's all the sports. It's, it's

806
00:46:54,805 --> 00:46:58,165
Speaker 2:  A begrudging. Thumbs up for Peacock. Yeah, I like it. All right. Two more

807
00:46:58,165 --> 00:46:59,365
Speaker 2:  to go Apple TV plus

808
00:46:59,705 --> 00:47:02,205
Speaker 23:  Ooh. Thumbs up. But that's just because I've been watching a bunch of the

809
00:47:02,205 --> 00:47:05,725
Speaker 23:  shows that are coming. Palm Royale incredible. I don't know what all I'm

810
00:47:05,725 --> 00:47:09,045
Speaker 23:  allowed to say about that. It's great. Awesome. Yeah, if you like Feud,

811
00:47:09,045 --> 00:47:12,925
Speaker 23:  you'll probably have a great time with it. Manhunt, which is about the

812
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:16,525
Speaker 23:  hunt for John Wilkes Booth after the assassination of

813
00:47:16,995 --> 00:47:20,805
Speaker 23:  Lincoln is certainly a show. And, and it's

814
00:47:20,805 --> 00:47:24,245
Speaker 23:  coming and people are going, some people are going to watch it, some people

815
00:47:24,305 --> 00:47:27,565
Speaker 23:  are not. It's still got stuff like for all Mankind just finished, wrapped

816
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:30,685
Speaker 23:  its fourth season, the fifth season is coming. Foundation is still doing

817
00:47:30,685 --> 00:47:34,285
Speaker 23:  really strong for them. They continue to be like the best place to watch

818
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:38,125
Speaker 23:  science fiction. Another season of Severance should be coming in 2024. It's,

819
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:42,005
Speaker 23:  it's shooting as we speak. So I'm, I'm really bullish on

820
00:47:42,005 --> 00:47:45,805
Speaker 23:  it. It exists entirely at like the permission of Tim

821
00:47:45,835 --> 00:47:49,165
Speaker 23:  Cook. Yeah. I think it is one of those things where if Tim Cook leaves and

822
00:47:49,165 --> 00:47:52,885
Speaker 23:  we get another CEO in and he doesn't care or she doesn't care as

823
00:47:53,045 --> 00:47:56,325
Speaker 23:  strongly about science fiction and weird, like catty shows,

824
00:47:56,985 --> 00:48:00,765
Speaker 23:  it could be in dire straits, but for now it's, it's doing really strongly.

825
00:48:00,995 --> 00:48:04,005
Speaker 23:  It's got some of the best programming out there. I

826
00:48:04,005 --> 00:48:07,925
Speaker 2:  Agree. I I actually think other than Netflix, apple TV plus would be my bet

827
00:48:07,925 --> 00:48:11,485
Speaker 2:  to be kind of the big winner of the streaming wars of 2024. Yeah. Apple has

828
00:48:11,485 --> 00:48:15,325
Speaker 2:  all the money in the universe. Its hit rate is, I would say the best of

829
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:18,885
Speaker 2:  anyone in the streaming game right now. It's gotten

830
00:48:19,065 --> 00:48:20,405
Speaker 23:  Really good. Yeah.

831
00:48:20,545 --> 00:48:23,565
Speaker 2:  So it's gotten to the point where like, I will watch the first episode of

832
00:48:23,565 --> 00:48:26,565
Speaker 2:  almost anything that comes out on Apple TV plus, just because the odds of

833
00:48:26,565 --> 00:48:29,565
Speaker 2:  it being good seem to be higher than almost any other service. So I think

834
00:48:29,565 --> 00:48:32,165
Speaker 2:  you're right that I would, it, it wouldn't be shocking if all of a sudden

835
00:48:32,165 --> 00:48:35,525
Speaker 2:  they just canceled the whole thing because it's sort of immaterial to Apple.

836
00:48:35,985 --> 00:48:39,765
Speaker 2:  But at the same time, apple is relying on Apple TV plus to sell Vision

837
00:48:39,915 --> 00:48:42,845
Speaker 2:  Pros and give you stuff to do in your Vision Pro. It's a way to sell iPhones.

838
00:48:42,845 --> 00:48:45,965
Speaker 2:  It's a way to get people into the service business. Like, I, I just don't,

839
00:48:46,165 --> 00:48:48,845
Speaker 2:  I don't see that being a problem. So, I'm, I'm with you. I'm a heart of thumbs

840
00:48:48,845 --> 00:48:52,565
Speaker 2:  up. I believe the, almost exact opposite about the last one on our list,

841
00:48:52,565 --> 00:48:55,885
Speaker 2:  which is Amazon Prime video. This is, I would say my hardest thumbs down

842
00:48:55,985 --> 00:48:59,085
Speaker 2:  of the year really because Amazon is in a place of

843
00:48:59,705 --> 00:49:03,445
Speaker 2:  trying to be more thoughtful about where it

844
00:49:03,445 --> 00:49:07,365
Speaker 2:  invests. It has invested an enormous amount of money in a

845
00:49:07,365 --> 00:49:10,885
Speaker 2:  lot of things that don't work on Prime video. And I think

846
00:49:11,355 --> 00:49:15,165
Speaker 2:  this service is going to look more and more like Amazon sports

847
00:49:15,165 --> 00:49:18,725
Speaker 2:  streaming and less and less like Netflix over time. Yeah.

848
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:21,205
Speaker 2:  I think this is not going to be a good year for Prime video.

849
00:49:21,515 --> 00:49:25,405
Speaker 23:  Yeah. They haven't had, like Amazon Prime History have not had a lot of

850
00:49:25,405 --> 00:49:29,285
Speaker 23:  hits. You've had, you have the voice, you have reacher, which I just started

851
00:49:29,565 --> 00:49:33,325
Speaker 23:  watching yesterday. It's fine. You've got Jack Ryan, you've got a lot of

852
00:49:33,325 --> 00:49:34,365
Speaker 23:  like manly shows,

853
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:37,285
Speaker 2:  Football dudes. Like that's the dynamic here, right?

854
00:49:37,425 --> 00:49:40,885
Speaker 23:  And then you got Wheel of Time, which I'm told I really need to watch season

855
00:49:40,885 --> 00:49:44,645
Speaker 23:  two. It's a delight, but I'm being told that I haven't felt the urge to

856
00:49:44,645 --> 00:49:45,165
Speaker 23:  watch it. Right?

857
00:49:45,165 --> 00:49:47,085
Speaker 2:  Same with Lord of the Rings. The rings of power, like Lord

858
00:49:47,085 --> 00:49:50,205
Speaker 23:  Of the Rings is an absolute boondoggle, the most expensive TV show ever

859
00:49:50,205 --> 00:49:53,005
Speaker 23:  made. And how many people watched it and how many people Dr. It certainly

860
00:49:53,005 --> 00:49:54,645
Speaker 23:  isn't driving subscriptions. Like, and you

861
00:49:54,645 --> 00:49:57,645
Speaker 2:  Know what's wild is the second biggest boondoggle I can think of is probably

862
00:49:57,645 --> 00:50:01,125
Speaker 2:  Citadel the other. Yes. Massively high budget flop on Prime video.

863
00:50:01,355 --> 00:50:01,645
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

864
00:50:02,035 --> 00:50:05,805
Speaker 23:  They have spent money stupidly, they are probably the after

865
00:50:05,805 --> 00:50:09,725
Speaker 23:  Netflix, the most guilty of, of embracing 0%

866
00:50:09,925 --> 00:50:12,885
Speaker 23:  interest rates to make garbage. Yes. They've got a leadership crisis as

867
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:16,125
Speaker 23:  far as the streaming service goes. They can print money though. That's,

868
00:50:16,205 --> 00:50:18,605
Speaker 23:  that's the one thing they can do because they just, they, they're forcing

869
00:50:18,745 --> 00:50:21,925
Speaker 23:  ads on every single subscriber, which means they're gonna be able to print

870
00:50:21,925 --> 00:50:25,685
Speaker 23:  money anytime you, you decide to say, check out that, read your show because

871
00:50:25,685 --> 00:50:29,165
Speaker 23:  everybody keeps talking about the large man, you're gonna be stuck watching,

872
00:50:29,165 --> 00:50:33,085
Speaker 23:  like you're going to make them money. So it is definitely one of those

873
00:50:33,085 --> 00:50:36,725
Speaker 23:  things where I think it is going to rapidly become something that

874
00:50:36,725 --> 00:50:37,805
Speaker 23:  Amazon forgets they own.

875
00:50:38,365 --> 00:50:38,685
Speaker 2:  Right.

876
00:50:39,225 --> 00:50:43,165
Speaker 23:  And the sports will do well and those, those couple shows that rise to

877
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:46,685
Speaker 23:  the top will do well and that's all we're gonna see. They, they, they're

878
00:50:46,685 --> 00:50:49,245
Speaker 23:  really good at buying movies that are already out in the marketplace. They've

879
00:50:49,245 --> 00:50:53,085
Speaker 23:  gotten really smart about that. Saltburn is an example of that. So I suspect.

880
00:50:53,085 --> 00:50:56,005
Speaker 23:  We're gonna see more of that and then just going and buying other people's

881
00:50:56,005 --> 00:50:58,965
Speaker 23:  stuff and putting it on rather than trying to program it themselves, which

882
00:50:58,965 --> 00:51:02,205
Speaker 23:  is probably for the best because they haven't been very good at programming

883
00:51:02,205 --> 00:51:02,365
Speaker 23:  it.

884
00:51:02,475 --> 00:51:06,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Amazon going back to being essentially a, a subscription

885
00:51:06,365 --> 00:51:10,325
Speaker 2:  like movie rental thing. Fine. Right. Like when I rent movies, I rent

886
00:51:10,325 --> 00:51:12,965
Speaker 2:  it mostly through Amazon because it's easy and the application works pretty

887
00:51:12,965 --> 00:51:16,685
Speaker 2:  well and like that's all fine and good, but as a cultural powerhouse

888
00:51:16,685 --> 00:51:19,445
Speaker 2:  streaming service, I just don't see it. And I think if, if I'm an Amazon

889
00:51:19,445 --> 00:51:23,245
Speaker 2:  executive looking for ways to pull back, like,

890
00:51:23,265 --> 00:51:27,085
Speaker 2:  oh, all of that money we spent on these shows that no one likes and watches,

891
00:51:27,735 --> 00:51:29,445
Speaker 2:  maybe that's a good place. Like it's,

892
00:51:29,505 --> 00:51:32,245
Speaker 23:  And and they've they've started doing that, right? Yeah. Like they canceled

893
00:51:32,605 --> 00:51:36,205
Speaker 23:  a ton of stuff last year. They, they renewed stuff and then went back and

894
00:51:36,205 --> 00:51:38,805
Speaker 23:  they canceled it. They they pulled a couple, I believe they pulled some

895
00:51:38,805 --> 00:51:42,205
Speaker 23:  stuff from their services. Well like, like they themselves know

896
00:51:42,755 --> 00:51:46,365
Speaker 23:  that nobody's really watching it and, and they need to just kinda like,

897
00:51:46,545 --> 00:51:50,205
Speaker 23:  that's why they added the ads. It's, it's a win-win for them. Yeah. The

898
00:51:50,205 --> 00:51:52,645
Speaker 23:  few people who are watching, they can make some extra money off of a

899
00:51:52,835 --> 00:51:55,445
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And if you wanna pay three more dollars a month to watch their bad

900
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:59,285
Speaker 2:  shows to not see ads, Amazon wins again. Yeah. Alright, so just

901
00:51:59,445 --> 00:52:03,285
Speaker 2:  to recap before we wrap up here, we're both thumbs up on

902
00:52:03,285 --> 00:52:05,645
Speaker 2:  Netflix. You can change your mind now. This is your last chance.

903
00:52:06,225 --> 00:52:09,005
Speaker 23:  I'm still tentatively thumbs up on Netflix. Yes.

904
00:52:09,345 --> 00:52:12,765
Speaker 2:  Disney Plus we're two thumbs down with a Hulu sized asterisk.

905
00:52:13,385 --> 00:52:16,925
Speaker 2:  Yes. Hulu. We are two thumbs up with a Disney plus sized asterisk

906
00:52:17,625 --> 00:52:21,605
Speaker 2:  Max. Your thumbs up I'm thumbs down Paramount plus your thumbs up. I'm thumbs

907
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:24,445
Speaker 2:  down. You're very optimistic about streaming this year. I like this for you.

908
00:52:24,635 --> 00:52:25,045
Speaker 2:  This is

909
00:52:25,045 --> 00:52:27,125
Speaker 23:  Gonna be a fun year for streaming business wise.

910
00:52:27,555 --> 00:52:30,725
Speaker 2:  Well, what's interesting is I, I think the thing that might make me most

911
00:52:30,775 --> 00:52:34,485
Speaker 2:  wrong is that because of the strike last year, there's just going to be a

912
00:52:34,675 --> 00:52:38,565
Speaker 2:  glut of good stuff this year and next year that, so

913
00:52:38,565 --> 00:52:42,365
Speaker 2:  like I think all of my potential doomsday predictions, I might just be

914
00:52:42,485 --> 00:52:45,845
Speaker 2:  a year or two two early on, which is the thing I'm most nervous about, but

915
00:52:46,145 --> 00:52:49,685
Speaker 2:  I'm, I'm holding fast to my beliefs here. Peacock, we're both thumbs up.

916
00:52:49,805 --> 00:52:53,605
Speaker 2:  I would say me slightly more aggressively than you. Yes. Mine is just a Michael Scott

917
00:52:54,315 --> 00:52:58,165
Speaker 2:  size thumbs up at all times. Apple TV plus we're both thumbs up

918
00:52:58,185 --> 00:53:00,445
Speaker 2:  and Prime video. It sounds like we're both thumbs down.

919
00:53:00,955 --> 00:53:02,285
Speaker 23:  Yeah. Okay. That's right.

920
00:53:02,665 --> 00:53:05,245
Speaker 2:  All right, I like it. All right. Rapid fire. And then we're gonna get outta

921
00:53:05,245 --> 00:53:09,205
Speaker 2:  here. Give me two other predictions You have anything at all about the streaming

922
00:53:09,205 --> 00:53:12,485
Speaker 2:  world this year that I can hold you against at the end of the year? I

923
00:53:12,535 --> 00:53:16,405
Speaker 23:  Think Hulu is gonna be merged into Disney Plus this year. Yeah.

924
00:53:16,405 --> 00:53:19,245
Speaker 23:  don don't know what the name of that that service is gonna be. Presumably

925
00:53:19,245 --> 00:53:23,045
Speaker 23:  Disney plus, maybe it'll be Star who can say, but I think that's gonna happen

926
00:53:23,045 --> 00:53:26,125
Speaker 23:  this year. Okay. And the other one is

927
00:53:26,855 --> 00:53:29,845
Speaker 23:  we're gonna not be talking about ads as much this year. Oh,

928
00:53:30,085 --> 00:53:30,845
Speaker 2:  Interesting. Okay.

929
00:53:31,205 --> 00:53:34,605
Speaker 23:  I think ads is a huge part of this deal and I think you, and I'll probably

930
00:53:34,605 --> 00:53:37,965
Speaker 23:  be talking about it much a lot, but I think the general public is not gonna

931
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,525
Speaker 23:  be thinking about ads on their streaming services this year. It's rolled

932
00:53:40,525 --> 00:53:43,205
Speaker 23:  out, it's happening. Everybody's, everybody's got it. They're all gonna

933
00:53:43,205 --> 00:53:46,565
Speaker 23:  be making a lot of money off of it and they're all gonna start behaving

934
00:53:46,565 --> 00:53:50,365
Speaker 23:  more like broadcast TV in order to make those advertising dollars

935
00:53:51,125 --> 00:53:54,165
Speaker 23:  sing. But I think you and I like the general public is not gonna notice

936
00:53:54,195 --> 00:53:57,645
Speaker 23:  much, much of that this year. We'll notice it in a couple years. I

937
00:53:57,645 --> 00:53:59,845
Speaker 2:  Think that's probably right and that's actually kind of related to my first

938
00:53:59,845 --> 00:54:03,605
Speaker 2:  prediction, which is that the fast, the, the ad supported channels like

939
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:08,085
Speaker 2:  Tubi and Freebie and Pluto, Pluto and that stuff that's out there now,

940
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:11,205
Speaker 2:  I think that's gonna have another huge year that's been growing a lot. We've

941
00:54:11,205 --> 00:54:14,165
Speaker 2:  talked about it a bunch, but I think now that ads are gonna be everywhere,

942
00:54:14,225 --> 00:54:17,645
Speaker 2:  you're gonna see advertisers say, oh well we're advertising all over streaming.

943
00:54:17,645 --> 00:54:21,085
Speaker 2:  Let's put even more into some of these fast channels that are growing really

944
00:54:21,085 --> 00:54:24,925
Speaker 2:  fast. And also viewers are going to say, oh well

945
00:54:24,925 --> 00:54:28,165
Speaker 2:  I'm looking at ads everywhere. What difference does it make? I'm gonna go

946
00:54:28,165 --> 00:54:30,885
Speaker 2:  find these other services that are free and don't make me log in. And all

947
00:54:30,885 --> 00:54:34,765
Speaker 2:  of a sudden that ease of user experience, if there's ads anyway,

948
00:54:35,155 --> 00:54:38,445
Speaker 2:  it's, it's a big win. So, I think that stuff is gonna continue to grow. It's

949
00:54:38,445 --> 00:54:41,485
Speaker 2:  a mess right now. Like there's tons of channels and there's actually a lot

950
00:54:41,485 --> 00:54:45,285
Speaker 2:  of good stuff out there, but trying to find it is bad. And So,

951
00:54:45,285 --> 00:54:48,605
Speaker 2:  what I think might happen is one of these big services

952
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:53,285
Speaker 2:  might as a way to get into the ad business even more, adopt a lot of these

953
00:54:53,285 --> 00:54:56,245
Speaker 2:  fast channels and actually make a good interface out of it. So, I'm, I'm

954
00:54:56,245 --> 00:54:58,885
Speaker 2:  hopeful that that's what happens this year and I think it's gonna be big.

955
00:54:59,365 --> 00:55:02,405
Speaker 23:  I think it's gonna be paramount. Plus I'm just saying out that they own

956
00:55:02,495 --> 00:55:06,165
Speaker 23:  Pluto. They've already got a bunch of kind of fast channels already on

957
00:55:06,175 --> 00:55:09,965
Speaker 23:  their service. I can see them being really smart about that in a way

958
00:55:09,965 --> 00:55:11,325
Speaker 23:  everybody else isn't. That's a good take.

959
00:55:11,425 --> 00:55:11,645
Speaker 2:  And

960
00:55:11,645 --> 00:55:15,445
Speaker 23:  The guy who founded Pluto is now running Paramount Plus as well. Oh yeah,

961
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:19,125
Speaker 23:  yeah. He's running both now. So, so like I said, I'm, I'm still very

962
00:55:19,125 --> 00:55:22,525
Speaker 23:  bullish on that one, otherwise I think it would be Max and Max would be

963
00:55:22,525 --> 00:55:23,165
Speaker 23:  dumb not to.

964
00:55:23,515 --> 00:55:27,005
Speaker 2:  Well I'm excited for all of that to become a peacock feature in 2024. It's

965
00:55:27,005 --> 00:55:30,885
Speaker 2:  gonna be sick. And then my other prediction is that someone don

966
00:55:30,885 --> 00:55:34,325
Speaker 2:  don't know who, but someone is going to actually build a universal

967
00:55:34,485 --> 00:55:38,285
Speaker 2:  streaming guide that is useful and good and will probably

968
00:55:38,285 --> 00:55:42,045
Speaker 2:  cost money but will be absolutely worth every penny.

969
00:55:42,065 --> 00:55:44,845
Speaker 2:  don don't know. Maybe it'll be the Apple TV app. Maybe it'll be one of the

970
00:55:44,845 --> 00:55:48,165
Speaker 2:  like just watches are real goods of the world, but like this is such a big

971
00:55:48,165 --> 00:55:51,445
Speaker 2:  problem and as all these companies go to ads, they want you to find their

972
00:55:51,445 --> 00:55:55,045
Speaker 2:  stuff better. So like Netflix now has an actual incentive

973
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:58,725
Speaker 2:  for me to be finding Netflix shows more easily

974
00:55:59,385 --> 00:56:02,085
Speaker 2:  and So I think somebody is gonna figure out how to put all this stuff together

975
00:56:02,085 --> 00:56:05,405
Speaker 2:  in a way that I can actually find the stuff I wanna watch more easily. That

976
00:56:05,405 --> 00:56:07,365
Speaker 2:  might be a pipe dream, but boy am I hoping that's right.

977
00:56:07,645 --> 00:56:11,565
Speaker 23:  Yeah, I I I love this for you. I think if it happens, it's

978
00:56:11,565 --> 00:56:14,125
Speaker 23:  not happening this year, I think it's gonna take Netflix a little time to

979
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:18,045
Speaker 23:  realize they need everybody else. So like 25, 26 I

980
00:56:18,045 --> 00:56:21,165
Speaker 23:  can see them finally being like, oh yeah, we should play nice with everybody

981
00:56:21,165 --> 00:56:24,365
Speaker 23:  else. But until then Netflix is gonna be like, nah, screw you guys.

982
00:56:25,385 --> 00:56:27,765
Speaker 23:  We got Stranger Things. It's coming back, don't worry about it.

983
00:56:28,205 --> 00:56:31,165
Speaker 2:  I get 11 months to believe in this before. Yeah, it becomes very obvious

984
00:56:31,185 --> 00:56:32,285
Speaker 2:  how wrong I was. Let me have

985
00:56:32,285 --> 00:56:35,165
Speaker 23:  This, I I'm everybody root for David, I'm rooting for you. I want this so

986
00:56:35,165 --> 00:56:35,725
Speaker 23:  I'm rooting for

987
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:37,805
Speaker 2:  You. I appreciate that, I appreciate that. Alright, we gotta take a break

988
00:56:37,985 --> 00:56:40,285
Speaker 2:  and then we're gonna come back and we're gonna do a Hotline question. Actually

989
00:56:40,285 --> 00:56:43,005
Speaker 2:  Alex, will you stick around for a minute? This Hotline question is kind of

990
00:56:43,005 --> 00:56:43,765
Speaker 2:  exactly for you.

991
00:56:44,245 --> 00:56:45,205
Speaker 23:  I love it. Let's do it.

992
00:56:45,265 --> 00:56:46,045
Speaker 2:  All right, we'll be right back.

993
00:56:51,935 --> 00:56:55,515
Speaker 4:  Can a vehicle be two things at once, remarkably luxurious and

994
00:56:55,715 --> 00:56:59,115
Speaker 4:  relentlessly capable? Can it be all electric but agile off grid?

995
00:56:59,815 --> 00:57:03,635
Speaker 4:  It can. Now introducing Kia's first three row all

1010
00:57:59,315 --> 00:58:03,125
Speaker 24:  Something strange is happening in Hollywood. I'm not talking

1011
00:58:03,455 --> 00:58:06,045
Speaker 24:  about that guy that got to host the Golden Globe. Yo,

1012
00:58:06,205 --> 00:58:07,285
Speaker 1:  I got the gig 10

1013
00:58:07,285 --> 00:58:10,485
Speaker 24:  Days ago. I'm talking about the secret musicals.

1014
00:58:11,105 --> 00:58:15,045
Speaker 1:  What's that? The Lord is the Queen Bee Regina George. Don't look her in

1015
00:58:15,045 --> 00:58:15,365
Speaker 1:  the eye.

1016
00:58:16,745 --> 00:58:19,805
Speaker 25:  You could be really hot if we change like everything.

1017
00:58:20,445 --> 00:58:24,125
Speaker 24:  A new Mean Girls movie comes out today. It promises it is not your

1018
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:27,765
Speaker 24:  Mother's Mean Girls, which rude. But also what does that mean?

1019
00:58:28,225 --> 00:58:31,685
Speaker 24:  The trailer never tells you. But check out this footage from a recent screening

1020
00:58:36,795 --> 00:58:40,685
Speaker 24:  that audience groaning when not Lindsay Lowen, Katie

1021
00:58:40,815 --> 00:58:44,285
Speaker 24:  Heron starts singing. They're bummed because they didn't want a musical,

1022
00:58:44,515 --> 00:58:48,165
Speaker 24:  they didn't necessarily know they were getting a musical but they got

1023
00:58:48,485 --> 00:58:52,085
Speaker 24:  a musical. And it's not just Mean Girls Why Hollywood

1024
00:58:52,385 --> 00:58:55,885
Speaker 24:  is hiding its musicals. This week on today. Explain.

1025
00:59:03,125 --> 00:59:06,065
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Let's do a question from The Vergecast Hotline. As

1029
00:59:17,265 --> 00:59:19,385
Speaker 2:  ton of good ones over the holidays actually. So I think we're gonna have

1030
00:59:19,385 --> 00:59:22,965
Speaker 2:  to do like an all Hotline episode here in the very near future. But for This

1031
00:59:22,965 --> 00:59:26,845
Speaker 2:  week we have a question that Alex, this could not be more

1032
00:59:27,025 --> 00:59:28,845
Speaker 2:  you centric, so let's hear it.

1033
00:59:29,985 --> 00:59:33,845
Speaker 27:  Hey Vir team, this is Wess from Texas. I'm calling to see if

1034
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:37,925
Speaker 27:  Krantz found any cool e Ink tech at CES. Would love to get the

1035
00:59:37,925 --> 00:59:39,045
Speaker 27:  rundown. Thanks

1036
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:40,005
Speaker 2:  Ooh.

1037
00:59:41,405 --> 00:59:45,285
Speaker 23:  I did see some some e Ink tech while I was at CES.

1038
00:59:45,555 --> 00:59:46,205
Speaker 2:  Tell us more.

1039
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:49,725
Speaker 23:  So some of it, it was a lot of concept stuff. There was obviously the e

1040
00:59:49,745 --> 00:59:53,045
Speaker 23:  Ink toilet Oh yes. That we all saw from Kohler,

1041
00:59:53,455 --> 00:59:56,725
Speaker 23:  which I think was a surprise to everyone, including e Ink,

1042
00:59:56,725 --> 01:00:00,405
Speaker 2:  Including potentially Kohler. Like you get the sense some one person made

1043
01:00:00,405 --> 01:00:03,565
Speaker 2:  that and they were just like, is this something? And they're like, CES, let's

1044
01:00:03,565 --> 01:00:03,685
Speaker 2:  do

1045
01:00:03,685 --> 01:00:06,645
Speaker 23:  It. Just bolted it on right when they got there and like, this is fine,

1046
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:10,405
Speaker 23:  nobody will notice. Yeah, So, I got, I got to go to the E Inc booth. They

1047
01:00:10,405 --> 01:00:13,325
Speaker 23:  they, they don't actually have like a show floor presence anymore. They

1048
01:00:13,325 --> 01:00:16,245
Speaker 23:  mainly just taking meetings. But I went into their meeting room and got

1049
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:20,205
Speaker 23:  to see all of their stuff and they had like all of the new, all of their

1050
01:00:20,205 --> 01:00:23,485
Speaker 23:  different displays there. It's a lot of signage stuff. They're still very,

1051
01:00:23,485 --> 01:00:27,045
Speaker 23:  very focused on the signage in a way the rest of us aren't. But there was

1052
01:00:27,045 --> 01:00:30,885
Speaker 23:  some phones from, I believe it's like the fifth largest smartphone maker

1053
01:00:31,025 --> 01:00:34,125
Speaker 23:  in the world. Have you heard of ics? No. With an x

1054
01:00:34,575 --> 01:00:35,845
Speaker 2:  Fifth largest. Jesus,

1055
01:00:36,745 --> 01:00:40,725
Speaker 23:  Not in America but in other places. They had the back of their, one of their

1056
01:00:40,725 --> 01:00:44,365
Speaker 23:  phones has the Prism e Ink technology on it, which is what we saw

1057
01:00:44,595 --> 01:00:48,325
Speaker 23:  from BMWA couple of years back. And what we also saw, Lenovo had a cool

1058
01:00:48,705 --> 01:00:51,045
Speaker 23:  laptop with the same tech on the front of it this year,

1059
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:55,085
Speaker 2:  Like once every four years somebody tries the, what if we put an Ink screen

1060
01:00:55,105 --> 01:00:57,565
Speaker 2:  on a smartphone thing and I'm here for it every single time.

1061
01:00:57,825 --> 01:01:01,005
Speaker 23:  And in both cases, instead of being like, what if you could read a book

1062
01:01:01,005 --> 01:01:04,045
Speaker 23:  on the back of your phone? Both companies are like, what if you could just

1063
01:01:04,045 --> 01:01:06,645
Speaker 23:  make the back of your laptop or the back of your phone look really cool?

1064
01:01:06,905 --> 01:01:09,725
Speaker 2:  Oh, interesting. It's like a wallpaper thing more than anything. Yeah, a

1065
01:01:09,725 --> 01:01:12,405
Speaker 23:  Hundred percent because it does like three to four colors but it doesn't

1066
01:01:12,405 --> 01:01:15,245
Speaker 23:  really, really well including white. It makes like a really vibrant white,

1067
01:01:15,245 --> 01:01:18,525
Speaker 23:  which you usually don't get from E Inc. And then you get like you choose

1068
01:01:18,565 --> 01:01:21,805
Speaker 23:  a couple other colors, you have to pre-program it. It's not gonna just let

1069
01:01:21,805 --> 01:01:25,725
Speaker 23:  you read a book and scroll or anything like that. It's really signage technology

1070
01:01:26,065 --> 01:01:29,005
Speaker 23:  and it looked cool and you'd be able to charge your phone with wireless

1071
01:01:29,365 --> 01:01:32,565
Speaker 23:  charging and just have the back look however you want it. Instead of being

1072
01:01:32,565 --> 01:01:36,485
Speaker 23:  like, oh I need a green phone. You'd be like, oh, I can have a stupid

1073
01:01:36,485 --> 01:01:40,405
Speaker 23:  person on the back of my phone. don don't know Homer Simpsons. I was

1074
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:43,885
Speaker 23:  like, what's a cartoon character I want on the back of my phone? Homer.

1075
01:01:44,105 --> 01:01:47,165
Speaker 23:  So that, that was really cool. I was really excited about that. The Lenovo

1076
01:01:47,305 --> 01:01:51,245
Speaker 23:  was obviously really, really cool. Other than that there was a lot

1077
01:01:51,245 --> 01:01:54,845
Speaker 23:  of sm, a lot of the smart home people are tossing e inc in as like

1078
01:01:54,975 --> 01:01:57,925
Speaker 23:  kinda little displays for sensors and things like that. We saw a couple

1079
01:01:57,945 --> 01:02:01,325
Speaker 23:  of those from smaller brands. That's not a new thing. Eve's been doing that

1080
01:02:01,325 --> 01:02:04,805
Speaker 23:  for a while. But it's nice to see other people adopt it. And

1081
01:02:05,105 --> 01:02:08,885
Speaker 23:  as much as I begged v to suddenly have seen a really

1082
01:02:08,885 --> 01:02:12,485
Speaker 23:  cool e Ink watch, she didn't, to my knowledge,

1083
01:02:12,945 --> 01:02:16,845
Speaker 23:  So I blame V entirely for that. Not the smart watch makers. It's all

1084
01:02:17,045 --> 01:02:20,605
Speaker 23:  Victoria's fault. Please tell her to to fix that. But,

1085
01:02:21,025 --> 01:02:23,725
Speaker 23:  but yeah, the phone was really cool and, and the way that they, these companies

1086
01:02:23,725 --> 01:02:27,645
Speaker 23:  were just like, wait, EIN doesn't need to be about reading. It doesn't have

1087
01:02:27,645 --> 01:02:31,165
Speaker 23:  to be a display. It can just be really cool wallpaper and give you customization

1088
01:02:31,705 --> 01:02:35,485
Speaker 23:  on a device where you traditionally haven't had it. And I want that.

1089
01:02:35,745 --> 01:02:36,165
Speaker 23:  That's

1090
01:02:36,165 --> 01:02:39,405
Speaker 2:  Kind of less ambitious than what we've heard from e Inc over the years. but

1091
01:02:39,405 --> 01:02:43,045
Speaker 2:  it is also probably more practical. They're like, this isn't gonna be the

1092
01:02:43,045 --> 01:02:47,005
Speaker 2:  year E Inc becomes a television. Like it's just, it's not, this isn't

1093
01:02:47,005 --> 01:02:49,325
Speaker 2:  gonna be that year either, but they're like, this is a thing it's actually

1094
01:02:49,325 --> 01:02:52,405
Speaker 2:  useful for and this is something you can do now. And that actually that tracks

1095
01:02:52,405 --> 01:02:53,205
Speaker 2:  for me. Yeah.

1096
01:02:53,345 --> 01:02:56,325
Speaker 23:  And, and you know, I spoke with the e Inc folks and they're still very focused

1097
01:02:56,325 --> 01:02:59,205
Speaker 23:  on signage. That's, that's where they make the most of their money. That's

1098
01:02:59,205 --> 01:03:02,005
Speaker 23:  what's doing really, really well for them. That's what they're bullish on

1099
01:03:02,005 --> 01:03:05,205
Speaker 23:  and they're like, we get really excited when people experiment and put it

1100
01:03:05,205 --> 01:03:09,085
Speaker 23:  in other things, toilets and, and, and tablets and, and phones.

1101
01:03:09,465 --> 01:03:12,805
Speaker 23:  But this is our focus. And so watching these companies be like, oh, maybe

1102
01:03:12,805 --> 01:03:16,045
Speaker 23:  we should also lean into that signage. Part of it is nice.

1103
01:03:16,195 --> 01:03:19,405
Speaker 23:  Hopefully next year we get something with really cool refresh rate. That's

1104
01:03:19,405 --> 01:03:20,005
Speaker 23:  what I really want.

1105
01:03:20,075 --> 01:03:23,765
Speaker 2:  Finally, give us full color and fast refresh rate and, and I will, I will

1106
01:03:23,765 --> 01:03:26,685
Speaker 2:  buy all Ink, all e Ink, everything. That's the life I wanna live.

1107
01:03:26,965 --> 01:03:30,365
Speaker 23:  I will note Onyx Books, who, who makes a lot of the e Ink tablets that I

1108
01:03:30,365 --> 01:03:33,965
Speaker 23:  really like. I love that company. They weren't at CES

1109
01:03:34,425 --> 01:03:37,645
Speaker 23:  so they'll they'll probably announce in, I, I would expect in the next couple

1110
01:03:37,645 --> 01:03:40,925
Speaker 23:  of weeks probably be ahead of Mobile World Congress is where we'll see their

1111
01:03:41,125 --> 01:03:44,205
Speaker 23:  announcements and so we'll probably get some really cool stuff then.

1112
01:03:44,845 --> 01:03:47,885
Speaker 2:  I like it. So thumbs up, thumbs down, Ian to 2024. How do we feel?

1113
01:03:48,285 --> 01:03:51,605
Speaker 23:  I mean I'll always thumbs up. I wish I could be thumbs down. Like, like

1114
01:03:51,725 --> 01:03:55,605
Speaker 23:  that's just, that's just bias. Like it's, it's totally biased on my

1115
01:03:55,605 --> 01:03:59,125
Speaker 23:  part. We saw a lot of cool technology announced last year that's getting

1116
01:03:59,165 --> 01:04:02,205
Speaker 23:  a little more mature and companies have had a year to figure out what to

1117
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:04,965
Speaker 23:  do with it. So we're gonna see some of that in the marketplace, particularly

1118
01:04:04,965 --> 01:04:08,845
Speaker 23:  around color e Ink and color E Ink readers. I saw a really cool one that

1119
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:12,405
Speaker 23:  was using Color Ink in that e Ink booth. I can't remember the name of it

1120
01:04:12,405 --> 01:04:16,365
Speaker 23:  right now. I think it was the big me one. Onyx books also had one and

1121
01:04:16,365 --> 01:04:19,445
Speaker 23:  it looked really, really cool. But I wanna see it not in a booth. I wanna

1122
01:04:19,445 --> 01:04:23,365
Speaker 23:  like spend more than a minute with it to say how cool it is. But the

1123
01:04:23,365 --> 01:04:25,805
Speaker 23:  color E Ink is getting a lot less goofy.

1124
01:04:26,235 --> 01:04:30,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Like the amount of time I have spent waiting for just this one

1125
01:04:30,205 --> 01:04:33,165
Speaker 2:  little thing thing. That's thing. Just give me a color. Kindle.

1126
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:37,285
Speaker 23:  We're so close to like Amazon or I'm really hoping Amazon.

1127
01:04:37,285 --> 01:04:41,125
Speaker 23:  Amazon noticed like we think Got Panos now. Panos, get out there. You

1128
01:04:41,125 --> 01:04:44,765
Speaker 23:  better have taken like 40,000 meetings with EE and get CES. I wanna see

1129
01:04:44,765 --> 01:04:46,245
Speaker 23:  some color Kindles. Let's do it

1130
01:04:46,785 --> 01:04:50,245
Speaker 2:  Man. If Panos fixes the Kindle after making the whole surface line of thing,

1131
01:04:50,305 --> 01:04:51,405
Speaker 2:  he he'll be a legend forever.

1132
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:51,925
Speaker 23:  A

1133
01:04:51,925 --> 01:04:54,765
Speaker 2:  Legend Panos, I know you're listening. Do it for us. Do it for the first

1134
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:54,965
