00:00:02,635 --> 00:00:06,565
Speaker 1:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of super helpful humanoid

3
00:00:06,585 --> 00:00:10,365
Speaker 1:  helper robots. I'm your friend, David Pierce and I am sitting

4
00:00:10,365 --> 00:00:14,285
Speaker 1:  here buying bathroom vanities. So. my wife and

5
00:00:14,285 --> 00:00:18,165
Speaker 1:  I, were having some work done in our house, partly to just like

6
00:00:18,165 --> 00:00:21,925
Speaker 1:  make our bathrooms nicer, but also because one of them is starting to

7
00:00:22,115 --> 00:00:26,085
Speaker 1:  leak. And if you're watching this on YouTube, just outta frame up

8
00:00:26,085 --> 00:00:29,965
Speaker 1:  there is just a growing stain. And. those are the

9
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:33,605
Speaker 1:  things that start to happen. And, I. just see all of the money that I have

10
00:00:33,605 --> 00:00:37,285
Speaker 1:  in the world start to disappear. So. anyway, we've been starting to do

11
00:00:37,435 --> 00:00:41,125
Speaker 1:  some work on renovating our bathroom, making some changes, and I have

12
00:00:41,325 --> 00:00:45,045
Speaker 1:  discovered that shopping for bathroom vanities is everything that is

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,765
Speaker 1:  wrong with online shopping. You go to the one of these websites, Wayfair

14
00:00:48,765 --> 00:00:52,445
Speaker 1:  or Lowe s or Home Depot or Amazon or Pottery Barn or Creighton Barrel.

15
00:00:52,705 --> 00:00:56,445
Speaker 1:  And it's just all the same stuff with different

16
00:00:56,605 --> 00:01:00,565
Speaker 1:  prices. You have to become like a subject matter expertise I now know the

17
00:01:00,565 --> 00:01:03,285
Speaker 1:  difference between solid wood and all the different types of manufactured

18
00:01:03,285 --> 00:01:07,205
Speaker 1:  wood and MDF, which is bad, but only in humid spaces. Like why do I

19
00:01:07,205 --> 00:01:10,325
Speaker 1:  know these things? This is not information I'm interested in knowing. But

20
00:01:10,325 --> 00:01:14,085
Speaker 1:  there isn't really just a place You can go online that's like, here are the

21
00:01:14,085 --> 00:01:18,045
Speaker 1:  good vanities. This is like the endless challenge of shopping on the

22
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:21,165
Speaker 1:  internet. You can't really trust the reviews because everybody has these

23
00:01:21,195 --> 00:01:25,045
Speaker 1:  paid for review programs. Some of the pictures you see are helpful, some

24
00:01:25,045 --> 00:01:28,645
Speaker 1:  aren't. Some of the one star reviews are just about like weird things that

25
00:01:28,645 --> 00:01:31,485
Speaker 1:  were happening in their house the day that things got delivered. It's just

26
00:01:32,365 --> 00:01:36,285
Speaker 1:  a mess. And so what I've ended up doing for these very expensive pieces

27
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:40,205
Speaker 1:  of furniture is basically just going online, finding one

28
00:01:40,205 --> 00:01:44,085
Speaker 1:  that looks good, and then Google lensing it. Because what you discover is

29
00:01:44,285 --> 00:01:47,365
Speaker 1:  actually most of these places are just selling the same thing. Much of it

30
00:01:47,365 --> 00:01:51,285
Speaker 1:  comes from China or other countries in Asia where they're just

31
00:01:51,285 --> 00:01:54,365
Speaker 1:  being shipped outta factories. And all these companies sell the same thing

32
00:01:54,655 --> 00:01:58,565
Speaker 1:  under different names often for very different prices. So I find one

33
00:01:58,565 --> 00:02:02,365
Speaker 1:  that I like, I Google lens it, and then I hope to God that there

34
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:06,485
Speaker 1:  is a set of reviews or helpful pictures or an expert in the field who

35
00:02:06,485 --> 00:02:10,365
Speaker 1:  has talked about this somewhere. And then you go on Reddit to see, because

36
00:02:10,365 --> 00:02:13,565
Speaker 1:  Reddit is the best place to get actual information about things. And everyone

37
00:02:13,565 --> 00:02:17,525
Speaker 1:  on Reddit is just like, go to a local cabinet maker, get this

38
00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:21,485
Speaker 1:  stuff custom made. Do not trust the internet. It's good advice. Honestly,

39
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:25,005
Speaker 1:  it's probably the correct advice for many things, not just bathroom vanities,

40
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,285
Speaker 1:  but the people are coming tomorrow to start putting new things in my bathroom

41
00:02:28,385 --> 00:02:32,365
Speaker 1:  and I don't have time. So I am fully, fully at

42
00:02:32,365 --> 00:02:36,325
Speaker 1:  the mercy of the internet right now and it's terrifying. Anyway, that's not

43
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:39,285
Speaker 1:  what we're talking about today. We have a super fun show coming up. We're

44
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:42,925
Speaker 1:  gonna do two things. First, we're gonna talk about Tesla, because Tesla

45
00:02:43,075 --> 00:02:46,885
Speaker 1:  last week had this big shareholder meeting, approved a huge payday for

46
00:02:46,915 --> 00:02:50,805
Speaker 1:  Elon Musk, but also gave a hint to what the next phase of Tesla

47
00:02:51,025 --> 00:02:54,565
Speaker 1:  is gonna be like. Some new products, some new initiatives at the company.

48
00:02:54,855 --> 00:02:57,885
Speaker 1:  We're gonna bring Andy Hawkins on and talk about all of it, and hopefully

49
00:02:57,885 --> 00:03:01,285
Speaker 1:  only a little about Elon Musk. After that, we're gonna talk about

50
00:03:01,475 --> 00:03:05,205
Speaker 1:  wearables. We have a new app that people are really excited about for

51
00:03:05,445 --> 00:03:09,165
Speaker 1:  tracking your steps and all that stuff. We have a new Apple Watch feature

52
00:03:09,165 --> 00:03:11,645
Speaker 1:  that people are excited about. We have a new Samsung watch that people are

53
00:03:11,645 --> 00:03:15,445
Speaker 1:  excited about. It's just a bunch of interesting, cool kind of fitness

54
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:19,325
Speaker 1:  and health stuff. And V Song from The Verge and I have been talking a lot

55
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:22,325
Speaker 1:  about finding more relaxed

56
00:03:23,055 --> 00:03:27,045
Speaker 1:  chill ways to do wearables and fitness instead of the like

57
00:03:27,055 --> 00:03:31,045
Speaker 1:  hyper intense capital F fitness people. How can I just have

58
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:34,965
Speaker 1:  a wearable that helps without yelling at me about it? So we're gonna do the

59
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:38,365
Speaker 1:  first part of a little bit of that today and more to come this summer.

60
00:03:38,745 --> 00:03:41,485
Speaker 1:  We also have a hotline question about whether that I'm very excited to talk

61
00:03:41,485 --> 00:03:45,445
Speaker 1:  about and lots more besides all that is coming up in just a sec. But

62
00:03:45,445 --> 00:03:49,125
Speaker 1:  first, I have 65 Lowe's tabs open that all look

63
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:52,605
Speaker 1:  essentially the same to me, and I have to go figure out which one I'm supposed

64
00:03:52,605 --> 00:03:56,045
Speaker 1:  to buy. Wish me luck. This is The Vergecast. We'll be right back.

65
00:05:53,935 --> 00:05:57,685
Speaker 1:  shareholder vote because he won, it was, he kind of laid out what he

66
00:05:57,755 --> 00:06:01,725
Speaker 1:  sees as the future for Tesla. He talked about the optimist robots. He talked

67
00:06:01,725 --> 00:06:05,205
Speaker 1:  about wanting to be a data setter company. He talked about full self-driving.

68
00:06:05,345 --> 00:06:09,205
Speaker 1:  He talked about superchargers, they talked about new vehicles. And I just

69
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:13,005
Speaker 1:  think Tesla is at a really interesting moment right now, and it felt like

70
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:16,645
Speaker 1:  a good time to talk about it. This company has been so important for so long

71
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:20,885
Speaker 1:  to the electric vehicle industry, to the whole tech industry, to the

72
00:06:20,885 --> 00:06:24,525
Speaker 1:  world. And this felt like a good moment to kind of check in on where

73
00:06:24,575 --> 00:06:28,125
Speaker 1:  Tesla the company is and where it's headed. And of course,

74
00:06:28,515 --> 00:06:32,085
Speaker 1:  Andy Hawkins is the person to do it with. Andy, welcome back to the show.

75
00:06:32,585 --> 00:06:34,245
Speaker 8:  Hey. Hello. Thanks for having me.

76
00:06:34,245 --> 00:06:38,165
Speaker 1:  It's been a minute. There's like just an onslaught of car stuff and

77
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,525
Speaker 1:  I feel like someday we're gonna have to catch up on all of the car stuff,

78
00:06:40,585 --> 00:06:41,725
Speaker 1:  but today it's Tesla

79
00:06:41,755 --> 00:06:42,885
Speaker 8:  Time. I'm here for it.

80
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:46,925
Speaker 1:  Okay, so I, I have two rules for you upfront and then, and then

81
00:06:46,925 --> 00:06:49,725
Speaker 1:  we're gonna dive in. Rule number one is I'm going to ask you a question about

82
00:06:49,835 --> 00:06:52,445
Speaker 1:  Elon Musk at the beginning, and I'm gonna ask you a question about Elon Musk

83
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,045
Speaker 1:  at the end. And in between we are going to talk about Elon Musk as little

84
00:06:55,065 --> 00:06:56,725
Speaker 1:  as possible. Is that fair?

85
00:06:57,285 --> 00:06:59,605
Speaker 8:  I that sounds more than fair, honestly.

86
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:03,485
Speaker 1:  Okay, good. And rule number two is less a rule and more of

87
00:07:03,485 --> 00:07:06,365
Speaker 1:  a caveat. And I'm, I'm going to make the caveat that I have and I want you

88
00:07:06,365 --> 00:07:09,885
Speaker 1:  to add or subtract to it as you would like to. Okay. We're about to talk

89
00:07:09,885 --> 00:07:13,525
Speaker 1:  a bunch about plans for Tesla and the company that Tesla plans to be.

90
00:07:13,835 --> 00:07:17,685
Speaker 1:  Elon Musk in particular is known for hyperbole, makes a lot of

91
00:07:17,685 --> 00:07:20,645
Speaker 1:  promises that don't always come true or don't always come true in the timeline.

92
00:07:20,905 --> 00:07:24,845
Speaker 1:  He has what I would call acute shiny object syndrome. And yet

93
00:07:24,885 --> 00:07:27,605
Speaker 1:  I still think all of this is worth digging into and talking about. Is that

94
00:07:27,605 --> 00:07:29,565
Speaker 1:  a fair caveat? Anything you would add or subtract?

95
00:07:29,985 --> 00:07:33,165
Speaker 8:  No, I think that that all sounds more than accurate. I accept your caveat.

96
00:07:33,725 --> 00:07:37,565
Speaker 1:  Good. All right, then beginning Elon Musk question really quick. There was

97
00:07:37,565 --> 00:07:40,965
Speaker 1:  this big shareholder vote last week. This has been really like in some ways,

98
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:44,885
Speaker 1:  like six years in the making. Just give me the very quick story

99
00:07:45,105 --> 00:07:48,765
Speaker 1:  as to why Tesla shareholders voted again to give Elon Musk

100
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,045
Speaker 1:  many tens of billions of dollars.

101
00:07:50,475 --> 00:07:54,205
Speaker 8:  Yeah, so they voted the first time to give him this amount of money

102
00:07:54,305 --> 00:07:57,845
Speaker 8:  or to promise to give him this amount of money back in 2018

103
00:07:58,755 --> 00:08:02,725
Speaker 8:  with, and I'll, I'll use it again. The caveat being that he had to meet certain

104
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:07,045
Speaker 8:  thresholds in order to actually see the, the, the full amount of the

105
00:08:07,145 --> 00:08:11,005
Speaker 8:  pay package that was approved for him. And he did, he met,

106
00:08:11,065 --> 00:08:14,445
Speaker 8:  met those conditions. Tesla's value exceeded

107
00:08:14,835 --> 00:08:17,845
Speaker 8:  wild leaps and bounds, and everyone's possible imagine of what Tesla could

108
00:08:18,005 --> 00:08:20,685
Speaker 8:  actually be valid. It exceeded in that it was the most valuable car maker

109
00:08:20,685 --> 00:08:24,565
Speaker 8:  in the world by 2021. And he was able to meet

110
00:08:24,565 --> 00:08:28,405
Speaker 8:  these thresholds and his pay package w was vested. Then at the

111
00:08:28,405 --> 00:08:31,525
Speaker 8:  beginning of this year, a lawsuit that had been winding its way through the

112
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:35,445
Speaker 8:  courts from a Tesla shareholder, this guy Richard Todo,

113
00:08:35,885 --> 00:08:38,685
Speaker 8:  who I believe is also a heavy metal drummer. Amazing. And he only owns amazing,

114
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:42,165
Speaker 8:  like a handful of shares, which is a kind of a fascinating aspect of all

115
00:08:42,165 --> 00:08:46,045
Speaker 8:  of this. Sued the company and Elon Musk saying that this process

116
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:50,005
Speaker 8:  was flawed. He should not have been awarded this amount of money and it should

117
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:53,405
Speaker 8:  get tossed out. A judge in Delaware where Tesla is incorporated,

118
00:08:53,945 --> 00:08:57,485
Speaker 8:  agreed and avoided his pay package in January of

119
00:08:57,485 --> 00:09:01,445
Speaker 8:  2024 that made Elon Musk very upset. And when

120
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:05,285
Speaker 8:  Elon Musk gets upset, his legion of fans, lots, lots of them

121
00:09:05,305 --> 00:09:09,085
Speaker 8:  who are whom are shareholders also got very upset and they decided

122
00:09:09,105 --> 00:09:12,885
Speaker 8:  to just do the process over again. So for the last several months,

123
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:16,525
Speaker 8:  they've been, Tesla has been engaged in a pretty aggressive

124
00:09:16,605 --> 00:09:20,365
Speaker 8:  lobbying effort to get its shareholders to once again approve

125
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:24,325
Speaker 8:  this, this massive pay package, which is upwards of $56 billion,

126
00:09:24,425 --> 00:09:27,965
Speaker 8:  has been said to, to be worth, which would make him the most highly compensated

127
00:09:27,965 --> 00:09:31,765
Speaker 8:  chief executive in modern history. So they went to the shareholders

128
00:09:31,965 --> 00:09:35,205
Speaker 8:  again, said, let's, let's vote for this once more time. Let's show this judge

129
00:09:35,205 --> 00:09:38,485
Speaker 8:  that when we said that we wanted him to get this money, we actually meant

130
00:09:38,485 --> 00:09:41,645
Speaker 8:  it. And lo and behold, Tesla shareholders voted

131
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:45,405
Speaker 8:  overwhelmingly to award Elon Musk his pay package once again.

132
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:47,445
Speaker 8:  And that's where we're at. Okay.

133
00:09:47,515 --> 00:09:50,685
Speaker 1:  This is why I think this is actually a good moment to talk about Tesla because

134
00:09:50,975 --> 00:09:54,885
Speaker 1:  there was a moment in the speech that Elon Musk gave after

135
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:58,565
Speaker 1:  the shareholder vote ended, where I think what he said was, this isn't a

136
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:01,365
Speaker 1:  new page for Tesla, it's a new book or something. Something like that. I'm

137
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:04,525
Speaker 1:  paraphrasing. Yeah, that's correct. Okay. And, and then I would say he, he

138
00:10:04,525 --> 00:10:08,285
Speaker 1:  proceeded to say, kind of lay out what he believes the future

139
00:10:08,305 --> 00:10:12,165
Speaker 1:  of Tesla to be. And I just wanna kind of run through a handful of them and,

140
00:10:12,165 --> 00:10:15,725
Speaker 1:  and kind of take your temperature on what you think about all of these big

141
00:10:15,725 --> 00:10:19,125
Speaker 1:  ideas as they pertain to kind of where Tesla is, is going from here. Sure.

142
00:10:19,145 --> 00:10:22,125
Speaker 1:  And I feel like the first place we have to start is with the, the optimist

143
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:24,725
Speaker 1:  robots. Right. I feel like if you were gonna pick a thing, oh, he would

144
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:27,685
Speaker 8:  Like you to start there. So I'm sure he'd be very glad that you're starting.

145
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:30,405
Speaker 1:  Okay. Well, so that, that's actually one of the things I'm most curious about.

146
00:10:30,425 --> 00:10:34,205
Speaker 1:  Is it, it didn't, it didn't feel like cars were the big story. It

147
00:10:34,205 --> 00:10:37,085
Speaker 1:  didn't feel like energy was the big story. It felt like robots was the big

148
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:41,045
Speaker 1:  story. Why, why robots? How did this become kind of the shiniest thing

149
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:41,285
Speaker 1:  at Tesla?

150
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:45,285
Speaker 8:  Yeah, so, you know, for years Elon and Tesla have been interested in

151
00:10:45,665 --> 00:10:49,525
Speaker 8:  ai. They have been trying to produce a self-driving car for

152
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:52,565
Speaker 8:  many, many years now. And Musk has been making numerous

153
00:10:53,045 --> 00:10:56,805
Speaker 8:  grandiose promises about how Tesla's future is actually in

154
00:10:57,285 --> 00:11:00,805
Speaker 8:  autonomy in robotics. And, you know, it's become sort of, you know, kind

155
00:11:00,805 --> 00:11:04,565
Speaker 8:  of like a, a bit of a, an inside joke almost. That, you know, he

156
00:11:04,685 --> 00:11:07,805
Speaker 8:  makes these promises that there's gonna be millions of self-driving vehicles

157
00:11:07,805 --> 00:11:11,565
Speaker 8:  on the road by certain dates. Those dates come and go. Lo and behold, there

158
00:11:11,565 --> 00:11:14,885
Speaker 8:  are no self-driving Teslas that have taken over the road. But we do have

159
00:11:14,885 --> 00:11:18,645
Speaker 8:  is, you know, a series of driver assist products. First there was autopilot,

160
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:21,405
Speaker 8:  then there was full self-driving. The drivers very much still need to take

161
00:11:21,405 --> 00:11:24,965
Speaker 8:  control, you know, pay attention to their, to the driving tasks. They cannot

162
00:11:25,355 --> 00:11:28,925
Speaker 8:  fall asleep or allow the, the car to drive itself without their

163
00:11:29,485 --> 00:11:33,205
Speaker 8:  attention. So it, it, it seems like there's still a ways to go

164
00:11:33,205 --> 00:11:37,045
Speaker 8:  still before we actually get to this point where Tesla has achieved

165
00:11:37,105 --> 00:11:40,645
Speaker 8:  and solved for autonomy like some other companies have made a lot more progress

166
00:11:40,715 --> 00:11:44,525
Speaker 8:  with. But that said, you know, I think the moment that we really saw this

167
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:48,365
Speaker 8:  become sort of more than just kind of like a side project of Tesla,

168
00:11:48,865 --> 00:11:52,645
Speaker 8:  but become sort of the core purpose and ethos of the entire

169
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:56,565
Speaker 8:  company, and obviously of sort of the way that Musk markets the company was

170
00:11:56,565 --> 00:12:00,525
Speaker 8:  around the time that I think OpenAI emerged with chat GBT.

171
00:12:00,525 --> 00:12:04,365
Speaker 8:  And then we started to see sort of the, the spread of AI fever and

172
00:12:04,365 --> 00:12:07,405
Speaker 8:  this become sort of very, very clear a hype cycle that were in the midst

173
00:12:07,405 --> 00:12:11,245
Speaker 8:  of at the moment. and it was clear that the, the things that investors

174
00:12:11,345 --> 00:12:15,045
Speaker 8:  in Wall Street formerly rewarded Tesla for, which was for

175
00:12:15,305 --> 00:12:18,885
Speaker 8:  it being on the vanguard of electrification and sort of changing

176
00:12:19,385 --> 00:12:23,325
Speaker 8:  the way that people think about personally owned vehicles, that was

177
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,685
Speaker 8:  somehow not as exciting anymore. I mean, Tesla was still worth a lot of money,

178
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:29,765
Speaker 8:  but it was suddenly people were starting, starting to pay more attention

179
00:12:29,905 --> 00:12:33,045
Speaker 8:  to the robotics and the autonomy aspects of the company. And I think Tesla

180
00:12:33,305 --> 00:12:37,085
Speaker 8:  and Elon especially really leaned into that and are now trying

181
00:12:37,145 --> 00:12:41,125
Speaker 8:  to sort of shift the definition of what Tesla is away from being just a

182
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:44,925
Speaker 8:  car maker to one that is focused primarily on AI and robotics. And that

183
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:48,845
Speaker 8:  really came out, I think, very strongly during the last earnings call, which

184
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:51,685
Speaker 8:  w what Elon said, and I'm paraphrasing that if you don't understand that

185
00:12:51,685 --> 00:12:54,765
Speaker 8:  this is what Tesla's all about, that we're an AI company and that we're gonna

186
00:12:54,765 --> 00:12:57,805
Speaker 8:  solve for autonomy, then you just don't understand the Tesla story.

187
00:12:58,485 --> 00:13:02,365
Speaker 1:  Interesting. So the thesis somewhat makes sense to me there, right? That

188
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,605
Speaker 1:  if you, if you solve in the same way that energy inside of cars

189
00:13:06,405 --> 00:13:09,925
Speaker 1:  ultimately lets you solve much bigger, wider sorts of energy problems,

190
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:13,965
Speaker 1:  solving autonomy inside of cars lets you solve other bigger, more

191
00:13:14,205 --> 00:13:18,165
Speaker 1:  interesting problems. And this is like, this is the version of the world

192
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:21,565
Speaker 1:  and future that Tesla has always talked about. And again, execution is another

193
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:25,245
Speaker 1:  thing, but like that version of how to think about what a car can

194
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:29,205
Speaker 1:  then expand out into sort of makes sense to me, right? That

195
00:13:29,205 --> 00:13:33,085
Speaker 1:  like, again, leaving aside whether it is possible for Tesla or anyone else

196
00:13:33,085 --> 00:13:36,885
Speaker 1:  to build a self-driving car, if You can, it puts you way down the road of

197
00:13:36,885 --> 00:13:39,365
Speaker 1:  solving a bunch of other really interesting problems. This

198
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:43,205
Speaker 8:  Is sort of fundamentally, I think what Tesla is trying to say

199
00:13:43,435 --> 00:13:46,845
Speaker 8:  into how it Musk is sort of trying to talk about the company, but I think

200
00:13:46,845 --> 00:13:50,725
Speaker 8:  what it belies is that, you know, kind of like something that he maybe would

201
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:54,405
Speaker 8:  not admit to and what a lot of people inside the company or it, the fans

202
00:13:54,405 --> 00:13:57,405
Speaker 8:  of the company would not really admit to, which is that he's just fundamentally

203
00:13:57,405 --> 00:14:00,765
Speaker 8:  bored with running a car company. Yes. That the car, the car company aspect

204
00:14:00,765 --> 00:14:04,325
Speaker 8:  of this has just become kind of, and, and you said it yourself talking about

205
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:08,125
Speaker 8:  his like shiny, shiny object syndrome. The car company is not a shiny object

206
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,485
Speaker 8:  anymore. It's not, it, it doesn't hold his interest. And this was so much

207
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:15,325
Speaker 8:  a part of the lobbying effort in the run up to the shareholder vote coming

208
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:19,325
Speaker 8:  from the chair of the, of Tesla's board, Robin Denholm on down,

209
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:23,085
Speaker 8:  talking about how we needed to award Musk this enormous

210
00:14:23,265 --> 00:14:27,245
Speaker 8:  sum of money because we need to hold his attention. Hmm. He has all of these

211
00:14:27,565 --> 00:14:31,005
Speaker 8:  projects, he's got his irons in, in multiple fires,

212
00:14:31,155 --> 00:14:34,485
Speaker 8:  whether it's obviously with X, formerly Twitter,

213
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,725
Speaker 8:  Neuralink, the boring company, SpaceX obviously being the,

214
00:14:38,725 --> 00:14:42,525
Speaker 8:  the granddaddy of them all. And Tesla is just not like keep keeping his

215
00:14:42,525 --> 00:14:46,445
Speaker 8:  attention the same way that it used to. So in order for him

216
00:14:46,505 --> 00:14:50,485
Speaker 8:  to fully devote himself and, and usher Tesla into this

217
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:53,685
Speaker 8:  next chapter or this next book as he likes to put it, you know, we need to

218
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:57,525
Speaker 8:  cut him this gigantic check because that's gonna be the way

219
00:14:57,525 --> 00:15:00,445
Speaker 8:  that's going to keep him sort of locked down and focused on what's gonna

220
00:15:00,445 --> 00:15:03,925
Speaker 8:  make Tesla the most successful company. So I, I think that there's an aspect

221
00:15:03,925 --> 00:15:07,125
Speaker 8:  of this like they're trying to solve for, for certain problems that they

222
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:10,685
Speaker 8:  think autonomy and robotics are gonna help them solve, whether it's around

223
00:15:10,775 --> 00:15:14,165
Speaker 8:  labor or around sort of like the safety around

224
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:18,205
Speaker 8:  ai. But I think fundamentally really just comes down to like, this dude is

225
00:15:18,205 --> 00:15:21,605
Speaker 8:  spread way too thin and they needed to keep him more consolidated and focused

226
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:22,925
Speaker 8:  on, on the task at hand.

227
00:15:23,175 --> 00:15:27,045
Speaker 1:  Right. And obviously what shinier cooler thing

228
00:15:27,045 --> 00:15:31,005
Speaker 1:  to think about, both for investors who care a lot about the

229
00:15:31,005 --> 00:15:34,645
Speaker 1:  stock price and for Elon Musk as an executive and just for like the people

230
00:15:34,665 --> 00:15:37,845
Speaker 1:  who follow Tesla than humanoid robots that follow you around your house,

231
00:15:37,845 --> 00:15:41,485
Speaker 1:  right? Like, I can't imagine a thing in this moment of this crazy

232
00:15:41,665 --> 00:15:45,645
Speaker 1:  AI hype cycle that will get more attention from more

233
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:48,965
Speaker 1:  people than we're gonna build a robot. Like

234
00:15:49,495 --> 00:15:52,645
Speaker 1:  screw your her thing that's on your phone, like, we're gonna build a fricking

235
00:15:52,735 --> 00:15:56,485
Speaker 1:  robot in your house. Like Tesla's thing is to take these things to like the

236
00:15:56,505 --> 00:16:00,005
Speaker 1:  nth degree. Like that feels very in keeping with how this company operates

237
00:16:00,005 --> 00:16:00,245
Speaker 1:  to me.

238
00:16:00,435 --> 00:16:03,805
Speaker 8:  Yeah, it 100%. and it was like the musk of the past

239
00:16:04,305 --> 00:16:07,285
Speaker 8:  was coming in, poking his head out a little bit during this, this shareholder

240
00:16:07,285 --> 00:16:10,645
Speaker 8:  meeting where he came out, he did his victory lap, he told everyone how much

241
00:16:10,645 --> 00:16:14,605
Speaker 8:  he loved them and then he just started speaking incredibly hyperbolically

242
00:16:14,605 --> 00:16:18,525
Speaker 8:  about, about how optimists and the, and the humanoid robots and how Tesla

243
00:16:18,665 --> 00:16:22,485
Speaker 8:  was going to have potentially hundreds of robots working in his factory

244
00:16:22,905 --> 00:16:26,525
Speaker 8:  by the end of next year, I think he said. And then he made some comment about

245
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:30,045
Speaker 8:  how Tesla was ultimately, or the, the robotics industry. I don't, I can't

246
00:16:30,165 --> 00:16:33,165
Speaker 8:  remember if it was exactly Tesla or robotics, but I'm sure he was seeing

247
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:35,645
Speaker 8:  them as sort of, sort of mutually the same was gonna be worth

248
00:16:35,645 --> 00:16:39,605
Speaker 8:  $25 trillion someday. Which like You can say what

249
00:16:39,605 --> 00:16:43,205
Speaker 8:  you will about Musk in his hyperbolic statements and how he hypes things

250
00:16:43,205 --> 00:16:46,285
Speaker 8:  too much and just sort of goes over the top in describing things. Millions

251
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:49,565
Speaker 8:  of electric cars solving for autonomy. AI robots, a

252
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:53,445
Speaker 8:  $25 trillion company is just not nothing that we've ever seen, nor do I

253
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:57,125
Speaker 8:  think we will see in the history of, of like corporate America

254
00:16:57,505 --> 00:17:00,765
Speaker 8:  or just, you know, the history of, of capitalism. It's just not something

255
00:17:00,765 --> 00:17:04,485
Speaker 8:  that I think a lot of people even think is fundamentally possible.

256
00:17:04,785 --> 00:17:08,325
Speaker 8:  But that said, that's, that was like fully like the, the vibe that he was

257
00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:09,925
Speaker 8:  trying to put out. I think with, with all of

258
00:17:09,925 --> 00:17:13,245
Speaker 1:  This. That makes sense. You have aggressively broken our no Elon Musk rule.

259
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,525
Speaker 1:  I'm very sorry, which means we have to move on. It's very hard to do. And

260
00:17:16,525 --> 00:17:19,805
Speaker 1:  this is like this, this is the strangest thing about this company right now.

261
00:17:19,825 --> 00:17:23,365
Speaker 1:  And we're this, this comes to my Elon Musk question at the end, but let's,

262
00:17:23,365 --> 00:17:25,845
Speaker 1:  let's get back to some car company stuff. Yes, let's do it. Because Tesla

263
00:17:26,025 --> 00:17:28,805
Speaker 1:  is still a car company no matter how it wants to talk about itself. There

264
00:17:28,805 --> 00:17:32,605
Speaker 1:  were three shrouded vehicles up from two shrouded vehicles that we've seen

265
00:17:32,605 --> 00:17:36,405
Speaker 1:  before. They put up the slide. Elon I believe said we have some stuff in

266
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:40,325
Speaker 1:  the pipeline. You speculated wildly about what these three vehicles

267
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:44,285
Speaker 1:  might be. Gimme the quick rundown. What do we, what do we think is, is literally

268
00:17:44,285 --> 00:17:48,165
Speaker 1:  under the hood that we're gonna see from Tesla in the near future? Yeah.

269
00:17:48,185 --> 00:17:51,925
Speaker 8:  So it was interesting to me because it was one more mystery vehicle than

270
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:54,885
Speaker 8:  we got last year, which is when they had their investor day and they talked

271
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:58,045
Speaker 8:  a lot about like the third master plan and about how they were going to use

272
00:17:58,045 --> 00:18:02,005
Speaker 8:  all the sustainable energy in order to shift the world over to a more

273
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:05,325
Speaker 8:  sustainable energy future. And at that time, you know, the, the criticism

274
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:08,165
Speaker 8:  against Tesla was that, oh, okay, they're talking high, high-minded about

275
00:18:08,165 --> 00:18:11,005
Speaker 8:  all these things that they want to do. They're losing focus. There's no new

276
00:18:11,005 --> 00:18:14,485
Speaker 8:  car announcement. There was nothing for people to really sink their teeth

277
00:18:14,675 --> 00:18:18,525
Speaker 8:  into except for a lot of these kind of like grandiose statements about

278
00:18:18,525 --> 00:18:20,205
Speaker 8:  what the future of energy was gonna be. Right. There

279
00:18:20,205 --> 00:18:22,685
Speaker 1:  Really hasn't been anything since the cyber truck, right. In terms of like

280
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,685
Speaker 1:  concrete. And that's a long time. If

281
00:18:24,845 --> 00:18:27,925
Speaker 8:  Anything, they've been all over the map. There's been reports about canceling

282
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:30,885
Speaker 8:  plans for, for a cheap model two type

283
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:34,965
Speaker 8:  $25,000 ev and then they are back onto it.

284
00:18:34,965 --> 00:18:38,165
Speaker 8:  And it's, it's unclear exactly where there's, where they stand on sort of

285
00:18:38,165 --> 00:18:41,165
Speaker 8:  like what the lineup, the vehicle lineup of the future is going to be. 'cause

286
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:45,085
Speaker 8:  I, I think because the cyber truck kind of sucked all the oxygen

287
00:18:45,085 --> 00:18:48,885
Speaker 8:  outta the room, it was an enormously difficult task to build up a production

288
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:52,325
Speaker 8:  sort of scheme around that truck because of how difficult it was to make.

289
00:18:52,585 --> 00:18:55,685
Speaker 8:  And that kind of just, and and obviously too, the company that, you know,

290
00:18:55,685 --> 00:18:59,365
Speaker 8:  a couple months ago went through a huge layoff period where they, you know,

291
00:18:59,365 --> 00:19:03,205
Speaker 8:  they laid off over 10%, maybe even up to 20% of the

292
00:19:03,205 --> 00:19:06,485
Speaker 8:  company was laid off. And now they're actually hiring a lot of those people

293
00:19:06,485 --> 00:19:09,725
Speaker 8:  back because they realize they fired too many of them, which is not the first

294
00:19:09,725 --> 00:19:13,205
Speaker 8:  time that that's happened with Tesla But anyway. So yeah, there was an, an

295
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:17,045
Speaker 8:  additional mystery vehicle under, under a shroud that they, that they hinted

296
00:19:17,045 --> 00:19:20,645
Speaker 8:  at during this shareholder meeting, two of which looked like had this shape

297
00:19:20,645 --> 00:19:24,485
Speaker 8:  of just regular Teslas. They looked kind of like model threes, you know,

298
00:19:24,485 --> 00:19:27,205
Speaker 8:  something that we can take from that we could say, okay, is is one of those,

299
00:19:27,765 --> 00:19:31,165
Speaker 8:  the model two is one of those the cheaper, smaller, more affordable

300
00:19:31,725 --> 00:19:34,365
Speaker 8:  electric car that they have said that they were gonna make and then said

301
00:19:34,365 --> 00:19:36,885
Speaker 8:  that they weren't. And you know, sort of been flip-flopping and backtracking

302
00:19:36,895 --> 00:19:40,445
Speaker 8:  going all over the place as to whether or not they actually have plans to

303
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:44,045
Speaker 8:  make this vehicle. Is the other one of those is that maybe the refreshed

304
00:19:44,085 --> 00:19:47,925
Speaker 8:  roadster that we were first promised, I think back in like 2019

305
00:19:48,035 --> 00:19:51,845
Speaker 8:  when they had the event announcing the Tesla semi truck and then

306
00:19:51,865 --> 00:19:54,325
Speaker 8:  the Roadster was sort of like brought out and saying, well, we're gonna read,

307
00:19:54,325 --> 00:19:57,085
Speaker 8:  we're gonna do the Roadster, the original vehicle that, that, you know, launched

308
00:19:57,085 --> 00:19:57,325
Speaker 8:  Tesla.

309
00:19:58,005 --> 00:20:01,845
Speaker 1:  I honestly forgot about that. Like if you, if you had asked me just now is

310
00:20:01,845 --> 00:20:04,885
Speaker 1:  there another Roadster, I would've said no, that was like the first I honestly

311
00:20:04,885 --> 00:20:08,325
Speaker 1:  forgot. And didn't they collect like huge deposits from people for that

312
00:20:08,325 --> 00:20:11,645
Speaker 8:  Too? Yeah, they've, they've taken a ton of deposits definitely over, you

313
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:14,285
Speaker 8:  know, several millions of dollars worth. But yeah, that doesn't appear to

314
00:20:14,285 --> 00:20:18,125
Speaker 8:  be any closer to production. We, we have not gotten many

315
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,005
Speaker 8:  words. I think he's tweeted a a few times about sort of what the progress

316
00:20:21,025 --> 00:20:24,765
Speaker 8:  is. There's been lots of claims about using like, you know, SpaceX style

317
00:20:24,995 --> 00:20:28,405
Speaker 8:  rockets to make this like the, you know, a a sure. A vehicle that can reach

318
00:20:28,405 --> 00:20:32,245
Speaker 8:  zero to 60 in under two seconds or maybe even a, a mi a second and a half.

319
00:20:32,245 --> 00:20:36,045
Speaker 8:  It's, you know, we're, we're bending the laws of physics. Yeah, it's, it's,

320
00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:40,205
Speaker 8:  it's gonna be a fun time. So one of those vehicles could be that Roadster

321
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:44,085
Speaker 8:  and then there was a third mystery vehicle which was more boxy shaped, a

322
00:20:44,085 --> 00:20:47,565
Speaker 8:  little bit taller, higher writing, maybe even Vanta shaped. So there was

323
00:20:47,565 --> 00:20:51,525
Speaker 8:  some speculation that this could be a Vanta or at least a, a more

324
00:20:51,555 --> 00:20:55,325
Speaker 8:  sort of high capacity vehicle. This could be the robo taxii that, that Tesla

325
00:20:55,465 --> 00:20:57,045
Speaker 8:  has been talking a lot about. I

326
00:20:57,045 --> 00:20:59,285
Speaker 1:  Was just about to say, do you really think Tesla is gonna make a minivan?

327
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:02,885
Speaker 1:  I, I think, but in the taxi version of the world that makes more sense to

328
00:21:02,885 --> 00:21:03,245
Speaker 1:  you if they're gonna

329
00:21:03,245 --> 00:21:07,005
Speaker 8:  Make some sort of purpose-built autonomous vehicle, the conventional

330
00:21:07,005 --> 00:21:10,725
Speaker 8:  wisdom is that it needs to be something that is kind of Vanta shaped, that

331
00:21:10,725 --> 00:21:13,725
Speaker 8:  You can fit a lot of people into it. You can, it could maybe be something

332
00:21:13,725 --> 00:21:17,045
Speaker 8:  where there could be some carpooling aspect of it or some ride sharing. So

333
00:21:17,105 --> 00:21:20,205
Speaker 8:  it does seem to be that maybe Tesla is interested in that or is interested

334
00:21:20,205 --> 00:21:24,165
Speaker 8:  in some sort of Vanta type format for its technology. So those

335
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:28,245
Speaker 8:  were sort of the guesses that I, I've seen and and others have, have

336
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,765
Speaker 8:  talked about is in terms of like what Tesla's future vehicle lineup might

337
00:21:31,765 --> 00:21:32,445
Speaker 8:  look like. Okay.

338
00:21:32,445 --> 00:21:35,245
Speaker 1:  The Robotaxis is supposed to come like this summer, right?

339
00:21:35,555 --> 00:21:39,485
Speaker 8:  Soon. Yeah, August 8th. He said, okay, is gonna be the event for

340
00:21:39,485 --> 00:21:40,005
Speaker 8:  that. I feel

341
00:21:40,005 --> 00:21:43,165
Speaker 1:  Like it's probably then a fairly safe bet to say

342
00:21:43,905 --> 00:21:46,245
Speaker 1:  one of those three is gonna be the robot taxii.

343
00:21:46,395 --> 00:21:48,925
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I think that that's correct. Okay. And he's, you know, they've been

344
00:21:48,925 --> 00:21:52,525
Speaker 8:  hyping that a lot in a lot of their communications. There have been talks

345
00:21:52,525 --> 00:21:56,445
Speaker 8:  about how it's gonna be somewhat similar design wise to the cyber trucks.

346
00:21:56,465 --> 00:22:00,445
Speaker 8:  So we were gonna see maybe a lot of angularity, something more triangular

347
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:04,285
Speaker 8:  shaped, perhaps probably not stainless steel, but you know, you never

348
00:22:04,285 --> 00:22:08,045
Speaker 8:  know with this company. But yeah, it's, this is gonna be sort of like what

349
00:22:08,045 --> 00:22:11,205
Speaker 8:  we've all been building towards, right? We've had these driver assist products,

350
00:22:11,735 --> 00:22:15,325
Speaker 8:  we've seen how they behaved out in public. You've got a lot of people, Tesla

351
00:22:15,325 --> 00:22:19,125
Speaker 8:  owners who are big fans of full self driving and autopilot. They think it's

352
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:22,605
Speaker 8:  great. It takes a lot of the pressure off of driving that. It works fantastically.

353
00:22:22,905 --> 00:22:26,085
Speaker 8:  And then there's just a, a ton of evidence that shows that it's just not

354
00:22:26,085 --> 00:22:29,925
Speaker 8:  what it's built up to be. Right. That it has serious gaps. There's been

355
00:22:29,925 --> 00:22:33,485
Speaker 8:  some studies to show that it can't execute certain maneuvers. There've been

356
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:37,325
Speaker 8:  hundreds of crashes, dozens of fatalities involving drivers

357
00:22:37,455 --> 00:22:41,445
Speaker 8:  using autopilot. And then there's concerns about how people might be overusing

358
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:45,405
Speaker 8:  these products more reliant in them than they should. And obviously due to

359
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:48,845
Speaker 8:  the fact that Tesla markets it in a way that probably leaves a lot of confusion

360
00:22:48,845 --> 00:22:49,125
Speaker 8:  to people,

361
00:22:49,385 --> 00:22:53,005
Speaker 1:  It is called full self-driving after all. Yes, that is, it's, it's hard to

362
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:54,965
Speaker 1:  not read that the way that it sounds.

363
00:22:55,595 --> 00:22:58,485
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I know. It's like, you know, why can't I take my eyes off the road?

364
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,885
Speaker 8:  Why can't I fall asleep? Why can't I climb into the back the backseat and

365
00:23:01,885 --> 00:23:05,565
Speaker 8:  and allow the car to drive me from from that way? Well, because, you know,

366
00:23:05,565 --> 00:23:08,965
Speaker 8:  there are plenty of of warnings that pop up on your screen to say to never

367
00:23:08,965 --> 00:23:12,085
Speaker 8:  do those things. So yeah, it's a, the way that Tesla markets these products

368
00:23:12,085 --> 00:23:15,845
Speaker 8:  and the reality of them are constantly in conflict and

369
00:23:15,845 --> 00:23:18,325
Speaker 8:  we're starting to see some court cases move their way through the system.

370
00:23:18,555 --> 00:23:21,765
Speaker 8:  Some regulators in California, the DMV, the Attorney General,

371
00:23:22,405 --> 00:23:26,205
Speaker 8:  the Department of Justice are, are all investigating Tesla as part,

372
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:29,685
Speaker 8:  maybe perhaps part of a, a, a criminal investigation to show that they have

373
00:23:29,965 --> 00:23:33,605
Speaker 8:  willfully misguided people in terms of how they've marketed the these

374
00:23:34,365 --> 00:23:35,085
Speaker 8:  this technology.

375
00:23:35,345 --> 00:23:38,965
Speaker 1:  Got it. Okay. Which makes the robax thing even higher

376
00:23:39,025 --> 00:23:40,485
Speaker 1:  stakes in a bunch of ways.

377
00:23:40,765 --> 00:23:42,205
Speaker 8:  I would say fraught. Fraught is the word

378
00:23:42,525 --> 00:23:45,725
Speaker 1:  Fraught. Iss a good word for it. There you go. Well, and speaking of around

379
00:23:45,795 --> 00:23:49,605
Speaker 1:  that, I think if you assume the robo taxii thing is real and coming

380
00:23:49,605 --> 00:23:53,405
Speaker 1:  this summer, it makes a bunch of the other things that Tesla and Elon Musk

381
00:23:53,405 --> 00:23:56,885
Speaker 1:  are talking about all the more important, right? He mentioned the Tesla network,

382
00:23:56,895 --> 00:23:59,645
Speaker 1:  which is the, the this idea that we've been hearing about for forever, that

383
00:23:59,645 --> 00:24:02,805
Speaker 1:  You can just get out of your car when you get to work and then your car can

384
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:06,125
Speaker 1:  go be a taxii all day and then come back the supercharger network, which

385
00:24:06,325 --> 00:24:09,005
Speaker 1:  I think we, we've heard a lot of conflicting things about in recent months.

386
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:13,645
Speaker 1:  The whole theory of like AWS for AI

387
00:24:13,645 --> 00:24:15,005
Speaker 1:  that Tesla is trying to be

388
00:24:15,505 --> 00:24:16,205
Speaker 8:  Oh, that's a good one. This

389
00:24:16,235 --> 00:24:20,205
Speaker 1:  Idea of this like big broad network of Teslas and what that can be

390
00:24:20,265 --> 00:24:24,125
Speaker 1:  in the world feels like it's about to get tested in a pretty

391
00:24:24,195 --> 00:24:28,165
Speaker 1:  real way after a lot of talk over the last few years.

392
00:24:28,305 --> 00:24:31,045
Speaker 1:  And obviously autopilot and self-driving is part of that because like the

393
00:24:31,045 --> 00:24:34,325
Speaker 1:  first part of Robo Taxii means there's not a person, this is not an Uber

394
00:24:34,865 --> 00:24:37,525
Speaker 1:  for Tesla thing, this is a very different thing Tesla is trying to go for

395
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:41,285
Speaker 1:  and like it feels like that's coming to a head here

396
00:24:41,285 --> 00:24:42,405
Speaker 1:  pretty fast, you know?

397
00:24:42,835 --> 00:24:46,245
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I mean it just sort of goes back to this, this idea that i, I put forward,

398
00:24:46,245 --> 00:24:50,085
Speaker 8:  which is that, you know, they're trying to explore many ways in

399
00:24:50,085 --> 00:24:53,685
Speaker 8:  which they can continue to hype Tesla and to

400
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:57,805
Speaker 8:  justify the valuation that's, that it's received over the years in ways

401
00:24:57,805 --> 00:25:01,765
Speaker 8:  that don't sort of expose kind of like the fundamental

402
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:05,565
Speaker 8:  reality of what the company is, which is that it's a car company, but when

403
00:25:05,565 --> 00:25:09,365
Speaker 8:  as soon as you put Tesla alongside of its fellow peers

404
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:13,085
Speaker 8:  in the auto industry alongside, I don't know, Ford and

405
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:17,165
Speaker 8:  gm, Chevy Buick, Audi Mercedes, it kind of loses its

406
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:20,765
Speaker 8:  luster in a lot of ways because we, we know about car companies, we've seen

407
00:25:20,765 --> 00:25:24,605
Speaker 8:  them for decades and decades, you know, over a century now we've had

408
00:25:24,605 --> 00:25:28,405
Speaker 8:  car companies and there's just nothing that, that, the story really

409
00:25:28,405 --> 00:25:32,165
Speaker 8:  doesn't lend itself so well to that kind of like excitement that has

410
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:36,285
Speaker 8:  surrounded Tesla but also must himself as someone who is like a futurist

411
00:25:36,365 --> 00:25:39,885
Speaker 8:  and is gonna help usher in kind of like this more, this better future that

412
00:25:39,885 --> 00:25:43,085
Speaker 8:  we have planned for us. But, you know, I think it's just really kind of like

413
00:25:43,155 --> 00:25:46,125
Speaker 8:  this tension and I think that that's why he's talking about things like robotic

414
00:25:46,305 --> 00:25:49,645
Speaker 8:  and ai, but even like the AWS stuff, I mean, that's just him

415
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:53,525
Speaker 8:  spitballing. And I've spoken to a number of, of experts that have said, you

416
00:25:53,525 --> 00:25:57,205
Speaker 8:  know, that that's like the fact that Tesla vehicles are cars

417
00:25:57,395 --> 00:26:01,325
Speaker 8:  that they move around and are go from place to place and it

418
00:26:01,325 --> 00:26:04,765
Speaker 8:  don't have like a fixed location necessarily. It's kind of, you know, sort

419
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:08,645
Speaker 8:  of undermines the idea of using it as some sort of like distributed

420
00:26:08,645 --> 00:26:12,605
Speaker 8:  network from which to, you know, get like, you know, more bang for your

421
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:16,165
Speaker 8:  buck in terms of like what an actual electric car can be used for. Which

422
00:26:16,205 --> 00:26:19,925
Speaker 8:  I think, you know, sort of ignores some of the, the real potential be

423
00:26:20,025 --> 00:26:23,605
Speaker 8:  behind EVs, which I think a lot of the other car makers have kind of seized

424
00:26:23,605 --> 00:26:27,445
Speaker 8:  upon, which is things like virtual power plants and sending energy back

425
00:26:27,445 --> 00:26:31,285
Speaker 8:  into the grid or using your EV as sort of like a mobile power

426
00:26:31,285 --> 00:26:34,205
Speaker 8:  generator that can help you out in the midst. You know, if there's a blackout,

427
00:26:34,265 --> 00:26:36,605
Speaker 8:  you know, we're having, there's a heat wave on the east coast this week,

428
00:26:36,605 --> 00:26:40,205
Speaker 8:  there's gonna be heat waves, you know, as part of our future fundamentally

429
00:26:40,355 --> 00:26:43,725
Speaker 8:  like, you know, we'd have to really kind of get, get used to that and EVs

430
00:26:43,725 --> 00:26:46,965
Speaker 8:  could be a real good way to help make sure that people don't, who do lose

431
00:26:46,965 --> 00:26:50,365
Speaker 8:  power, don't use, lose the things that they really need the most, you know,

432
00:26:50,365 --> 00:26:53,605
Speaker 8:  refrigeration and AC and things like that during these times. So, you know,

433
00:26:53,605 --> 00:26:57,045
Speaker 8:  there's a lot of things that e EVs can be used for that that beyond just

434
00:26:57,045 --> 00:27:00,685
Speaker 8:  like driving from from A to B and it doesn't seem like he really has, or

435
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:02,645
Speaker 8:  the company really has much interest in those things.

436
00:27:02,835 --> 00:27:06,325
Speaker 1:  Yeah, that makes sense. So to that point actually, my impression of Tesla

437
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:10,925
Speaker 1:  for years has been that it was very

438
00:27:10,935 --> 00:27:14,845
Speaker 1:  early to a lot of things and was right about a lot of where things

439
00:27:14,845 --> 00:27:18,525
Speaker 1:  were going beforehand, even leaving all of the good and bad of Elon Musk

440
00:27:18,535 --> 00:27:22,165
Speaker 1:  aside, like Tesla was right about the future pretty early on and

441
00:27:22,275 --> 00:27:25,925
Speaker 1:  correctly bet on a bunch of things including electric vehicles. The

442
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:29,765
Speaker 1:  story around Tesla the last few years seems to be that it has given

443
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:33,725
Speaker 1:  up a lot of that lead as a car company, right? And, and that it's the sort

444
00:27:33,725 --> 00:27:37,325
Speaker 1:  of moat that it built for itself has like withered and

445
00:27:37,495 --> 00:27:41,405
Speaker 1:  dried up, I guess to just like destroy that metaphor. Is that fair? Like,

446
00:27:41,405 --> 00:27:45,325
Speaker 1:  is the, what is Tesla's moat as a car company at this point? And, and again,

447
00:27:45,325 --> 00:27:47,765
Speaker 1:  the answer is not allowed to be Elon Musk because we're gonna come back to

448
00:27:47,765 --> 00:27:51,445
Speaker 1:  that, but as a, as a pure like technology and car company,

449
00:27:52,075 --> 00:27:55,965
Speaker 1:  does it have some of that moat and advantage still? Or has it,

450
00:27:55,985 --> 00:27:58,445
Speaker 1:  has the landscape around it just changed? Yeah,

451
00:27:58,485 --> 00:28:01,565
Speaker 8:  I think it's, it's kind of a complicated answer because I think in some aspects

452
00:28:01,565 --> 00:28:04,925
Speaker 8:  it does because I think we've seen, you know, the thing that was most often

453
00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:08,645
Speaker 8:  described as Tesla's moat was its supercharger network, right? That it made

454
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,925
Speaker 8:  these cars that people wanted, you know, they were expensive and they were

455
00:28:12,165 --> 00:28:15,725
Speaker 8:  futuristic looking, but it, none of that would've worked if there was not

456
00:28:15,865 --> 00:28:19,285
Speaker 8:  the infrastructure, the charging infrastructure to support the ownership

457
00:28:19,285 --> 00:28:22,565
Speaker 8:  of those vehicles. And so Tesla very smartly realized that it needed to,

458
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:26,405
Speaker 8:  to build that itself, that it was not gonna get the help from the

459
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:30,245
Speaker 8:  government or from maybe even like the, the supplier network and

460
00:28:30,245 --> 00:28:34,005
Speaker 8:  the, the, the third party aftermarket industry that exists. It needed to

461
00:28:34,205 --> 00:28:37,965
Speaker 8:  do it itself and it did, and it created what, what is still stands today

462
00:28:38,345 --> 00:28:41,965
Speaker 8:  as being the best and most reliable and most

463
00:28:42,075 --> 00:28:45,685
Speaker 8:  distributed ev charging network that exists on the planet.

464
00:28:46,385 --> 00:28:50,205
Speaker 8:  And they not only did that, but then they opened up that standard,

465
00:28:50,565 --> 00:28:53,965
Speaker 8:  the charging standard that they saw as being sort of more

466
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:58,045
Speaker 8:  streamlined and cheaper and more sort of technologically

467
00:28:58,045 --> 00:29:00,405
Speaker 8:  proficient. And they opened it up to the rest of the industry and they said,

468
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:03,605
Speaker 8:  okay, this is not just ours anymore. This is the North American charging

469
00:29:03,925 --> 00:29:07,245
Speaker 8:  standard, the NACS, you all can use this. And Ford was the first to jump

470
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:10,165
Speaker 8:  on board and then GM followed and then the, all the dominoes soon followed

471
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,845
Speaker 8:  afterwards. And now we have every single major automaker in the world

472
00:29:14,445 --> 00:29:17,765
Speaker 8:  saying that, that not only will they give their own customers, their own

473
00:29:17,865 --> 00:29:21,765
Speaker 8:  EV owners access to Tesla's network, but they will also adopt the plug for

474
00:29:21,765 --> 00:29:24,645
Speaker 8:  themselves on their future EVs. So we're gonna start seeing Ford vehicles

475
00:29:24,645 --> 00:29:28,565
Speaker 8:  and GM vehicles come out with Tesla's plug versus the, the one that exists

476
00:29:28,565 --> 00:29:32,445
Speaker 8:  today, which is the, the CCS plug. And so that is in,

477
00:29:32,445 --> 00:29:36,405
Speaker 8:  in a lot of ways Tesla's moat and still stands today as, as, as Tesla's moat

478
00:29:36,405 --> 00:29:39,765
Speaker 8:  in, in protection against the future. But it was always gonna be the case

479
00:29:39,765 --> 00:29:43,725
Speaker 8:  that it was not gonna be able to maintain the market share that it had. I

480
00:29:43,725 --> 00:29:47,485
Speaker 8:  mean it had the advantage of being first, so therefore it, you know, I think

481
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:51,445
Speaker 8:  at the most it had over 75% of the EV sales as

482
00:29:51,555 --> 00:29:55,085
Speaker 8:  Tesla's a eventually. And if it was successful, if it could

483
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:57,845
Speaker 8:  guarantee the fact that it was successful, other companies were, were going

484
00:29:57,845 --> 00:30:01,805
Speaker 8:  to inevitably follow its lead and make their own electric cars. And

485
00:30:01,805 --> 00:30:05,445
Speaker 8:  now you're starting to see that market share shrink, it's now around 50%,

486
00:30:05,865 --> 00:30:09,525
Speaker 8:  its sales are down, its revenue is down, its profits have shrank.

487
00:30:09,745 --> 00:30:12,885
Speaker 8:  And so there's, you know, there's a lot of concern about, you know, sort

488
00:30:12,885 --> 00:30:16,645
Speaker 8:  of Tesla's future as a car company, which it's still for all the

489
00:30:16,795 --> 00:30:20,365
Speaker 8:  bluster about AI and robotics, it still is fundamentally a car company.

490
00:30:20,495 --> 00:30:24,205
Speaker 1:  Right. And is that because Tesla has lost

491
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:28,005
Speaker 1:  some of its swagger or because everybody else has finally caught up or a

492
00:30:28,005 --> 00:30:28,485
Speaker 1:  little bit of both?

493
00:30:28,965 --> 00:30:32,005
Speaker 8:  I think a little bit of both. I think you've got the fact that it's not just

494
00:30:32,045 --> 00:30:35,285
Speaker 8:  a Tesla anymore. You can go out, You can take a look at these really great

495
00:30:35,845 --> 00:30:39,405
Speaker 8:  electric Hyundais and these great electric Kias, the Ford Mustang Mach e

496
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:42,205
Speaker 8:  remains a very popular vehicle now you've got electric trucks, you've got

497
00:30:42,505 --> 00:30:46,325
Speaker 8:  the electric F-150 and the Silverado and there's more to come. And then

498
00:30:46,825 --> 00:30:50,125
Speaker 8:  if you don't even like some of those old dusty old legacy car companies,

499
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:52,885
Speaker 8:  there's Rivian and there's Polestar and there's all these other sort of newer

500
00:30:53,295 --> 00:30:57,205
Speaker 8:  Tesla light companies that have maybe as much of a

501
00:30:57,205 --> 00:31:00,725
Speaker 8:  sheen on them as Tesla did. And maybe you don't like the kind of things that

502
00:31:00,915 --> 00:31:04,485
Speaker 8:  Elon Musk stands for. You don't like the things he says on X, you don't like

503
00:31:04,485 --> 00:31:08,285
Speaker 8:  his positions, his political positions, which have obviously become more

504
00:31:08,285 --> 00:31:11,925
Speaker 8:  conservative and right wing over the last few years. And he's not shy about

505
00:31:11,925 --> 00:31:15,645
Speaker 8:  sharing those with the world. And so if you find that to be abhorrent,

506
00:31:15,825 --> 00:31:19,325
Speaker 8:  You can, you know, there's plenty of other places for you to go. And I think

507
00:31:19,325 --> 00:31:22,885
Speaker 8:  that as we've seen in this presidential election now with, with electric

508
00:31:22,885 --> 00:31:26,845
Speaker 8:  vehicles becoming so politicized that if Republicans are railing

509
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:30,805
Speaker 8:  against EVs in what you're left with is an entirely a

510
00:31:31,005 --> 00:31:34,845
Speaker 8:  progressive or democratic or left-leaning customer demographic,

511
00:31:35,135 --> 00:31:39,005
Speaker 8:  those people are not going to be willingly gobbling up Tesla's left and right.

512
00:31:39,005 --> 00:31:42,445
Speaker 8:  Maybe they begrudgingly will buy a Tesla because of how good the charging

513
00:31:42,445 --> 00:31:46,405
Speaker 8:  network is or the prices which have come down significantly in

514
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,845
Speaker 8:  the last few years. And now You can get a Tesla, especially a used one for,

515
00:31:49,985 --> 00:31:53,965
Speaker 8:  you know, around 20, $25,000 in a lot of ways we, the

516
00:31:53,965 --> 00:31:57,885
Speaker 8:  $25,000 EV exists and it just happens to be a used model

517
00:31:57,885 --> 00:32:01,685
Speaker 8:  three. So, you know, I think in some ways that it's become a lot more

518
00:32:01,685 --> 00:32:05,125
Speaker 8:  complicated, but then in a lot of other ways, this is the way that it was

519
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:08,365
Speaker 8:  always going to go, especially if Tesla was as successful as it, it has proven

520
00:32:08,365 --> 00:32:09,645
Speaker 8:  to be. Right.

521
00:32:09,665 --> 00:32:13,165
Speaker 1:  So you, you've brought me to my last Elon Musk question and then, and then

522
00:32:13,205 --> 00:32:17,045
Speaker 1:  I will let you go. I think a lot of this roadmap is really interesting to

523
00:32:17,045 --> 00:32:20,405
Speaker 1:  me. And Tesla deserves credit over the years for pulling off a lot of what

524
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:23,045
Speaker 1:  it said it was going to do. It's been much weirder than we expected, but

525
00:32:23,045 --> 00:32:26,765
Speaker 1:  Tesla did a lot of the stuff it said it was going to do. And so to the extent

526
00:32:26,765 --> 00:32:29,165
Speaker 1:  that I want to give the company the benefit of the doubt that it has been

527
00:32:29,165 --> 00:32:31,725
Speaker 1:  able to do this in the past, I might be able to do it again. That's one thing.

528
00:32:31,745 --> 00:32:35,125
Speaker 1:  But we've talked about this so much over the years that Elon Musk is Tesla

529
00:32:35,225 --> 00:32:38,965
Speaker 1:  and Tesla is Elon Musk, and I feel like what that means has

530
00:32:39,005 --> 00:32:42,725
Speaker 1:  changed. So I'm curious for, for your read right now in 2024, even

531
00:32:42,725 --> 00:32:46,525
Speaker 1:  different from what it was in 2018, the first time shareholders voted to

532
00:32:46,525 --> 00:32:50,285
Speaker 1:  give him all this money, what is your read on what Elon Musk means to

533
00:32:50,285 --> 00:32:54,205
Speaker 1:  Tesla in sort of this next phase? Like is that that close association

534
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:57,685
Speaker 1:  was undeniably good for Tesla for a really long time? Say what you will,

535
00:32:57,685 --> 00:33:01,285
Speaker 1:  it just, it just was whether you were a person who liked electric

536
00:33:01,285 --> 00:33:05,245
Speaker 1:  vehicles or a person who owned Tesla stock, victory's all around for

537
00:33:05,245 --> 00:33:08,685
Speaker 1:  a long time there, do you think that's still the case in the next

538
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:12,605
Speaker 1:  phase of this company? Or has it sort of inexorably changed since

539
00:33:12,605 --> 00:33:13,885
Speaker 1:  2018? I think

540
00:33:13,995 --> 00:33:17,325
Speaker 8:  It's still the case because if you look at the vote totals, you look at the

541
00:33:17,325 --> 00:33:19,965
Speaker 8:  way that people voted their shares, which there were billions of shares that

542
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:23,605
Speaker 8:  were, that were voted during this, this past shareholder vote, over

543
00:33:23,605 --> 00:33:27,285
Speaker 8:  70% voted in favor of awarding him this pay package,

544
00:33:27,575 --> 00:33:31,485
Speaker 8:  which is a pretty strong sign that people see Tesla and

545
00:33:31,585 --> 00:33:35,565
Speaker 8:  not only Tesla as it is today, but Tesla's future as some

546
00:33:35,565 --> 00:33:39,085
Speaker 8:  sort of undefined robotics company or whatever it is in the future

547
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:43,605
Speaker 8:  as being inextricably linked to Elon Musk and his

548
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:46,725
Speaker 8:  ability to be the one that sort of is guiding that ship. So I think that

549
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:50,085
Speaker 8:  that was a pretty clear sign if we had seen, and it was pretty much, I think

550
00:33:50,145 --> 00:33:54,045
Speaker 8:  the same percent that first awarded him that pay

551
00:33:54,045 --> 00:33:57,605
Speaker 8:  package back in 2018. So there's been six years right

552
00:33:57,675 --> 00:34:01,645
Speaker 8:  between these two votes and we're seeing basically an unchanged vote

553
00:34:01,645 --> 00:34:05,445
Speaker 8:  total. That said, you know, and I talked to a couple of experts in, in the

554
00:34:05,445 --> 00:34:08,765
Speaker 8:  midst of this, if you're someone who bought Tesla shares back in 2011, you

555
00:34:08,785 --> 00:34:12,045
Speaker 8:  are really happy with Elon Musk in the way that he's been leading this company.

556
00:34:12,305 --> 00:34:16,245
Speaker 8:  If you're someone who bought shares in 2023, you have probably a lot of

557
00:34:16,405 --> 00:34:19,565
Speaker 8:  questions and you're, you're probably wondering about what the post musk

558
00:34:19,665 --> 00:34:23,445
Speaker 8:  future is for Tesla. And he was asked that during the shareholder meeting,

559
00:34:23,445 --> 00:34:26,525
Speaker 8:  which he stood on stage and took a lot of questions. Many of them were

560
00:34:27,385 --> 00:34:31,125
Speaker 8:  not great questions, they left a lot to be desired. You know,

561
00:34:31,265 --> 00:34:35,205
Speaker 8:  as one can imagine at a Tesla event of this kind, you're gonna get a lot

562
00:34:35,205 --> 00:34:39,165
Speaker 8:  of like, you know, sort of overt displays of feely and, and I call

563
00:34:39,165 --> 00:34:41,445
Speaker 1:  Them the how are you so terrific questions. Exactly,

564
00:34:41,745 --> 00:34:45,725
Speaker 8:  Yes. I call them sycophant scot questions But. anyway, you

565
00:34:45,725 --> 00:34:48,925
Speaker 8:  got a lot of those types of questions. But somebody did ask him some, some

566
00:34:48,925 --> 00:34:51,805
Speaker 8:  something along the lines of like, you know, you, you're not gonna live forever,

567
00:34:52,135 --> 00:34:55,565
Speaker 8:  which I maybe Musk might disagree with, I know, right? He might, I know a

568
00:34:55,565 --> 00:34:58,405
Speaker 8:  lot of him and his friends are working on that problem right now, but that,

569
00:34:58,545 --> 00:35:01,445
Speaker 8:  that's it. Either they're like, how's your health? Or something along like

570
00:35:01,545 --> 00:35:05,125
Speaker 8:  the lines of that and what's gonna be the future of Tesla? And he gave the

571
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:08,765
Speaker 8:  vague answer. He is like, I'm very excited and confident in the future of

572
00:35:08,765 --> 00:35:12,685
Speaker 8:  Tesla. There's just no one line being lined up to take the, the reins

573
00:35:12,685 --> 00:35:16,165
Speaker 8:  of this company. In fact, most of the people that could have I think were

574
00:35:16,165 --> 00:35:19,765
Speaker 8:  fired in the last round of layoffs that they had. Most of the, the

575
00:35:19,765 --> 00:35:23,725
Speaker 8:  c-suite executives have departed. There's new people that have just come

576
00:35:23,725 --> 00:35:27,245
Speaker 8:  in, it just does not seem that they have any interest in

577
00:35:27,245 --> 00:35:30,965
Speaker 8:  grooming somebody. And that's it. I mean, Musk is not that old. He's still

578
00:35:30,985 --> 00:35:34,605
Speaker 8:  in his fifties and it probably has, you know,

579
00:35:35,115 --> 00:35:38,245
Speaker 8:  long years ahead of him running this company and it's very clear that that's

580
00:35:38,275 --> 00:35:42,125
Speaker 8:  what the shareholders want, which is why they voted it this way. So it

581
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:44,965
Speaker 8:  just seems like, you know, yes, the people who have said that Musk is Tesla

582
00:35:45,025 --> 00:35:48,965
Speaker 8:  and Tesla is Musk, that is more accurate today than it ever has

583
00:35:48,965 --> 00:35:52,325
Speaker 8:  been. And I think it's just a question of does he still see himself

584
00:35:52,595 --> 00:35:56,285
Speaker 8:  leading this company and if so, what is his vision of the future? Because

585
00:35:56,545 --> 00:35:59,605
Speaker 8:  that's the one clearly that most people are interested in, in following.

586
00:35:59,735 --> 00:36:03,725
Speaker 1:  Right. and it sounds like very much under that world in

587
00:36:03,725 --> 00:36:07,365
Speaker 1:  which Elon Musk and Tesla are more connected than ever, Tesla

588
00:36:07,545 --> 00:36:10,925
Speaker 1:  is going to look less and less like a car company as time goes on. Yeah,

589
00:36:10,955 --> 00:36:14,485
Speaker 8:  It's possible. It's very possible that it becomes, you know, that the car

590
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:18,485
Speaker 8:  aspect of, of its like business shrinks. But if that's the case,

591
00:36:18,485 --> 00:36:21,645
Speaker 8:  they need to really start to think about how they're gonna replace those

592
00:36:21,645 --> 00:36:25,045
Speaker 8:  revenues. Because right now they're in a bit of a bind because the,

593
00:36:25,505 --> 00:36:29,285
Speaker 8:  you know, it's over 80% of their revenues are automotive. They still,

594
00:36:29,345 --> 00:36:32,605
Speaker 8:  you know, obviously pull in some revenue from, from the energy side of the

595
00:36:32,725 --> 00:36:36,205
Speaker 8:  business and from from battery storage, you know, the, the solar aspect of

596
00:36:36,205 --> 00:36:40,045
Speaker 8:  their, of their business has remained pretty flat. It's not growing nearly

597
00:36:40,105 --> 00:36:43,565
Speaker 8:  as much as I'm sure a lot of analysts would like to see it grow. So there's

598
00:36:43,565 --> 00:36:47,205
Speaker 8:  just nothing really to replace the money yet. And obviously robotics and

599
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:50,885
Speaker 8:  autonomy and the Tesla network and self-driving cars and the robo robax and

600
00:36:51,005 --> 00:36:54,565
Speaker 8:  all these things remain just far too theoretical

601
00:36:55,025 --> 00:36:58,845
Speaker 8:  for anyone to sort of like hang anything solid on. So I just think

602
00:36:58,845 --> 00:37:02,685
Speaker 8:  that if it wants to be this company that it's, it's setting itself up for,

603
00:37:02,945 --> 00:37:06,765
Speaker 8:  it needs to start to demonstrate how it's actually going to make

604
00:37:06,765 --> 00:37:10,365
Speaker 8:  money. Otherwise, I think a lot of shareholders are gonna feel very much

605
00:37:10,365 --> 00:37:12,085
Speaker 8:  like bag holders at the end of all of this.

606
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,085
Speaker 1:  Yeah, at some point you gotta start selling stuff.

607
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:16,005
Speaker 8:  That's how it works. That's how, how I'm

608
00:37:16,005 --> 00:37:19,645
Speaker 1:  Told there's a lot of that going on with AI in general right now is is it's,

609
00:37:19,645 --> 00:37:22,965
Speaker 1:  it's all very shiny and at some point you gotta start selling stuff and I

610
00:37:22,965 --> 00:37:25,765
Speaker 1:  think I have a feeling we're headed for a couple years of reckoning on what

611
00:37:25,765 --> 00:37:28,245
Speaker 1:  You can and can't sell when it comes to AI stuff.

612
00:37:28,555 --> 00:37:29,405
Speaker 8:  That sounds about right.

613
00:37:29,635 --> 00:37:31,285
Speaker 1:  Alright Andy, thank you as always.

614
00:37:31,675 --> 00:37:32,765
Speaker 8:  It's my pleasure. Thanks David.

615
00:37:33,475 --> 00:37:33,965
Speaker 9:  Alright,

616
00:37:34,025 --> 00:37:36,845
Speaker 1:  We gotta take a break and then we're gonna come back and talk about wearables

617
00:41:37,345 --> 00:41:40,685
Speaker 10:  if you have an injury that's making it harder to close your rings or maybe

618
00:41:40,685 --> 00:41:44,565
Speaker 10:  you just need a day off, You can pause them for a rest day, week or more

619
00:41:44,825 --> 00:41:46,325
Speaker 10:  and keep your award streak going.

620
00:41:46,945 --> 00:41:50,765
Speaker 1:  The thing where I'm lying on the couch feeling sick or tired

621
00:41:50,905 --> 00:41:54,645
Speaker 1:  or just haven't had time that day to go exercise and my watch is like

622
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:58,325
Speaker 1:  yelling at me about not closing my rings is the thing that makes me want

623
00:41:58,325 --> 00:42:00,845
Speaker 1:  to take off my Apple Watch. I've actually turned off a lot of the goals,

624
00:42:01,245 --> 00:42:04,765
Speaker 1:  I just try to not worry about that stuff anymore. But I like the idea of

625
00:42:04,765 --> 00:42:08,565
Speaker 1:  being able to care about it and then not care about it But. anyway,

626
00:42:08,565 --> 00:42:12,245
Speaker 1:  that is just one piece of a lot of wearable news.

627
00:42:12,385 --> 00:42:15,805
Speaker 1:  In the last few weeks we've gotten lawsuits from Samsung over

628
00:42:16,065 --> 00:42:19,805
Speaker 1:  Aura's Smart Rings, we've gotten Pixel watch leaks, we've gotten a new

629
00:42:19,805 --> 00:42:23,405
Speaker 1:  Samsung, Galaxy Watch, we've gotten a bunch of FDA News

630
00:42:24,025 --> 00:42:27,685
Speaker 1:  vs. Song has been covering all of this and is deep in the

631
00:42:27,685 --> 00:42:31,245
Speaker 1:  wearable space as anyone who listens to this show will know. So I figured

632
00:42:31,425 --> 00:42:34,725
Speaker 1:  I'd have her just come on and we're just gonna plow through some news and

633
00:42:34,725 --> 00:42:38,485
Speaker 1:  talk about how big a deal any of this really is and take a victory

634
00:42:38,585 --> 00:42:41,085
Speaker 1:  lap on rest days fi song. Welcome back.

635
00:42:41,265 --> 00:42:42,245
Speaker 11:  Thanks for having me.

636
00:42:42,465 --> 00:42:46,405
Speaker 1:  You did it. This is the, this is the biggest news in the history of the song

637
00:42:47,465 --> 00:42:51,205
Speaker 1:  at wwdc this year. We're gonna do, I have Apple stuff, Samsung

638
00:42:51,295 --> 00:42:54,085
Speaker 1:  stuff, and Google stuff I want to talk about. But we gotta start with Apple.

639
00:42:54,545 --> 00:42:58,165
Speaker 1:  I'm just, the floor is yours. If You can laugh, You can cry, You can be happy.

640
00:42:58,315 --> 00:43:00,965
Speaker 1:  It's rest days. We got rest days VI

641
00:43:01,705 --> 00:43:05,645
Speaker 11:  Was screaming so loud in my house and like, so I

642
00:43:05,885 --> 00:43:09,445
Speaker 11:  have this one cat who loves to like just annoy me in my room. He likes to

643
00:43:09,445 --> 00:43:13,365
Speaker 11:  sit with me in my office and as soon as they're like, oh and rest days

644
00:43:13,365 --> 00:43:15,765
Speaker 11:  they're gonna be a thing now I was like, yes.

645
00:43:17,425 --> 00:43:21,005
Speaker 11:  So loud. And I was just like typing in the, in The Verge Slack with like

646
00:43:21,005 --> 00:43:24,525
Speaker 11:  so many typos just 'cause I was going like, ha. And I saw that you mentioned

647
00:43:24,525 --> 00:43:28,325
Speaker 11:  in the live blog that somewhere I was like fist pumping. Yes, all of that

648
00:43:28,325 --> 00:43:31,445
Speaker 11:  was happening. And if it wasn't for the fact that I had to like get the

649
00:43:31,445 --> 00:43:35,205
Speaker 11:  watch os 11 blog out, I would've probably just like run around

650
00:43:35,235 --> 00:43:38,645
Speaker 11:  like a crazy person in my office just going like, oh

651
00:43:39,545 --> 00:43:43,245
Speaker 11:  yes, finally, this is so great. So many levels

652
00:43:43,525 --> 00:43:47,245
Speaker 11:  I could, it's just like, and I'm here to wax poetic on it so I will.

653
00:43:47,345 --> 00:43:51,285
Speaker 11:  But like this has been 10 years of the Apple Watch and

654
00:43:51,285 --> 00:43:54,525
Speaker 11:  it, it has been like a feature that I have been wanting for at least eight

655
00:43:54,545 --> 00:43:58,245
Speaker 11:  of those years just because it's, oh my God, where do I start?

656
00:43:58,245 --> 00:44:02,165
Speaker 11:  There's just so many reasons why you need a rest day. And

657
00:44:02,305 --> 00:44:06,205
Speaker 11:  the big one is that we're not machines. And I actually think streaks are

658
00:44:06,205 --> 00:44:10,125
Speaker 11:  quite toxic for the average person because we all

659
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:14,045
Speaker 11:  know that one Apple watch person who's just like, oh yeah, I

660
00:44:14,045 --> 00:44:17,405
Speaker 11:  was sick, but huh, there's no way I'm breaking my streak.

661
00:44:17,845 --> 00:44:21,725
Speaker 11:  So I just lowered it and went for a walk and I was like, I hear

662
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:25,645
Speaker 11:  that story so many times and I'm just like, that is the opposite of

663
00:44:25,645 --> 00:44:29,405
Speaker 11:  improving your health that is actively not doing the best

664
00:44:29,615 --> 00:44:33,605
Speaker 11:  thing for your health and your body in that point in time. And

665
00:44:33,605 --> 00:44:37,245
Speaker 11:  then there's, for other people, those notifications are actually

666
00:44:37,245 --> 00:44:41,045
Speaker 11:  extremely demoralizing. Yeah. So when I had Covid, I had it

667
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:44,885
Speaker 11:  pretty bad. I couldn't really think properly. I don't actually

668
00:44:45,165 --> 00:44:48,925
Speaker 11:  remember a lot of having covid because it was like a bad time. But one thing

669
00:44:49,325 --> 00:44:52,445
Speaker 11:  I really do remember was getting a buzz on my wrist looking and it's like,

670
00:44:52,465 --> 00:44:56,245
Speaker 11:  You can still do it. You can take a 27 minute walk and

671
00:44:56,245 --> 00:44:57,325
Speaker 11:  close that ring. Yes.

672
00:44:57,385 --> 00:45:00,525
Speaker 1:  The thing where it's like, just go for an 11 mile walk, it's only 9:00 PM

673
00:45:00,545 --> 00:45:03,165
Speaker 1:  you'll be fine. It's like, what? No, and

674
00:45:03,165 --> 00:45:06,845
Speaker 11:  It's like I'm, no, actually I am, I have Covid

675
00:45:06,895 --> 00:45:10,765
Speaker 11:  right now. And so I was just so annoyed and I

676
00:45:10,765 --> 00:45:14,725
Speaker 11:  took the watch off and I, and I put it on the charger because that's

677
00:45:14,725 --> 00:45:17,525
Speaker 11:  just how type A I am. I was just like, oh, I'm not gonna throw it across

678
00:45:17,525 --> 00:45:20,205
Speaker 11:  the room. I'm gonna put it very gently on the charger. But

679
00:45:21,595 --> 00:45:25,565
Speaker 11:  that, that kind of impulse. And I have also heard from several

680
00:45:25,585 --> 00:45:29,365
Speaker 11:  of my friends that on their wedding days they either wore their Apple

681
00:45:29,365 --> 00:45:32,805
Speaker 11:  watch on their ankles or gave it to their spouse

682
00:45:33,225 --> 00:45:36,365
Speaker 11:  to carry for them. 'cause they were not gonna break that streak even though

683
00:45:36,365 --> 00:45:39,565
Speaker 11:  it was their wedding day. And I was just like, I, I think,

684
00:45:40,285 --> 00:45:44,085
Speaker 11:  I think we've gotten to a point where the streak is no longer helpful if

685
00:45:44,085 --> 00:45:48,005
Speaker 11:  you are at that point, I think we have lost sight of what the streak is

686
00:45:48,165 --> 00:45:52,045
Speaker 11:  supposed to be. Yep. It, it is a motivational tool and yeah, of

687
00:45:52,045 --> 00:45:55,605
Speaker 11:  course like it is a great way to kind of visualize your

688
00:45:55,635 --> 00:45:58,885
Speaker 11:  consistency. But you know, You can have a weekly streak. You can have a

689
00:45:58,885 --> 00:46:02,685
Speaker 11:  monthly streak. It doesn't have to be a daily streak. And after

690
00:46:03,085 --> 00:46:06,965
Speaker 11:  a certain point it's actually counterintuitive like the, the more into training

691
00:46:07,065 --> 00:46:10,085
Speaker 11:  you go, you're supposed to have rest days, you're supposed to have days

692
00:46:10,085 --> 00:46:13,925
Speaker 11:  where you do absolutely nothing. And on days where you do absolutely

693
00:46:13,925 --> 00:46:17,725
Speaker 11:  nothing, let me tell you, if you have your move ring set at like a thousand

694
00:46:18,005 --> 00:46:21,205
Speaker 11:  calories, like some people do, you're not gonna get a thousand calories

695
00:46:21,265 --> 00:46:25,165
Speaker 11:  of exercise or you should not get a thousand calories of exercise on

696
00:46:25,165 --> 00:46:28,605
Speaker 11:  a rest day. Especially when you're doing something like physically taxing,

697
00:46:28,605 --> 00:46:32,285
Speaker 11:  like any kind of race training, any kind of, especially if you're doing

698
00:46:32,445 --> 00:46:35,405
Speaker 11:  a marathon, those rest days are really important because some people are

699
00:46:35,405 --> 00:46:39,125
Speaker 11:  out here and they're, and they're pounding the pavement for four hour

700
00:46:39,275 --> 00:46:43,205
Speaker 11:  long runs. You're putting an incredible amount of stress on your body. Any

701
00:46:43,205 --> 00:46:47,005
Speaker 11:  athlete will tell you rest is incredibly important. And that's why so

702
00:46:47,035 --> 00:46:51,005
Speaker 11:  many athletes gravitate toward the whoop, they gravitate towards the

703
00:46:51,105 --> 00:46:55,085
Speaker 11:  AA ring because those are prioritizing rest. And everybody else

704
00:46:55,105 --> 00:46:59,005
Speaker 11:  in the industry for the past three, four years has been prioritizing

705
00:46:59,035 --> 00:47:02,965
Speaker 11:  rest in some form and capacity. So to have Apple lag

706
00:47:03,065 --> 00:47:06,605
Speaker 11:  so far behind on that, it was just, it's like the most

707
00:47:06,755 --> 00:47:10,245
Speaker 11:  glaring thing because the Apple Watch is the leader in the smartwatch world,

708
00:47:10,295 --> 00:47:13,485
Speaker 11:  right? It it is like the one that everyone points to. It's the one that's

709
00:47:13,485 --> 00:47:16,285
Speaker 11:  popular. It's, you know, apple does something with smart watches, everybody

710
00:47:16,315 --> 00:47:19,405
Speaker 11:  follows. But the one thing that they really weren't doing for the longest

711
00:47:19,405 --> 00:47:23,165
Speaker 11:  time was sleep tracking. And then on top of sleep tracking rest and recovery

712
00:47:23,425 --> 00:47:26,125
Speaker 11:  was just like close your rings or

713
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:30,045
Speaker 1:  Else. Yeah, it really, it gets like menacing. And then the, the notification

714
00:47:30,045 --> 00:47:33,965
Speaker 1:  that really did me in was the one the next morning where

715
00:47:34,345 --> 00:47:38,045
Speaker 1:  you wake up and it's like, Ugh, you only closed two rings yesterday.

716
00:47:38,515 --> 00:47:42,365
Speaker 1:  Like parentheses, you pathetic, monster, let's try and do

717
00:47:42,365 --> 00:47:46,165
Speaker 1:  better today. And I get those when I don't wear my watch for

718
00:47:46,325 --> 00:47:49,525
Speaker 1:  a day. And it's like, come on, watch. Like I just wasn't, I didn't have this

719
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:52,885
Speaker 1:  on. And then I get to the point where I'm like, I go for a walk and I'm not

720
00:47:52,885 --> 00:47:55,285
Speaker 1:  wearing the watch. And all of a sudden you have that feeling of like, oh,

721
00:47:55,285 --> 00:47:57,565
Speaker 1:  it didn't count because I'm, and then, and then it's like, those are the

722
00:47:57,565 --> 00:48:01,165
Speaker 1:  moments where I'm like, oh, this is no longer serving the purpose that I

723
00:48:01,165 --> 00:48:02,285
Speaker 1:  got this to serve for me.

724
00:48:02,595 --> 00:48:06,485
Speaker 11:  Yeah. You know, I, I had that exact experience this weekend. I

725
00:48:06,625 --> 00:48:10,445
Speaker 11:  forgot my watch when we, my friend and I went out to a park and then we

726
00:48:10,445 --> 00:48:13,485
Speaker 11:  went for a hike at that park and I was like, the entire time in my head

727
00:48:13,485 --> 00:48:17,165
Speaker 11:  I was like, it's not going to count. Right? It's not gonna count. And I

728
00:48:17,165 --> 00:48:20,245
Speaker 11:  really hate that. That's not gonna count because this is a very steep hill

729
00:48:20,825 --> 00:48:24,805
Speaker 11:  and like, I'm not getting credit for that. But that's actually, it's

730
00:48:24,805 --> 00:48:28,725
Speaker 11:  super counterintuitive because I still did the hike. I still did the

731
00:48:28,725 --> 00:48:32,165
Speaker 11:  thing that was very good for my body just because the Apple watch didn't

732
00:48:32,165 --> 00:48:35,805
Speaker 11:  acknowledge it. You know, like I, and I think we have to really examine

733
00:48:36,195 --> 00:48:40,125
Speaker 11:  what streaks mean. So like before Apple introduced this ability to pause

734
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:43,725
Speaker 11:  your, pause your rings, which I downloaded the beta and I've used it since

735
00:48:43,785 --> 00:48:47,245
Speaker 11:  and I like really was just like, oh my God, this is, this is such a nice

736
00:48:47,245 --> 00:48:50,965
Speaker 11:  feeling that I'm not getting punished for that. But before that, I would

737
00:48:50,965 --> 00:48:54,845
Speaker 11:  just, every once in a while, once I got a streak up to like 90 days,

738
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:56,845
Speaker 11:  I would perfect purposefully break it.

739
00:48:57,445 --> 00:48:58,925
Speaker 1:  Interesting. For your own sanity? Just

740
00:48:58,925 --> 00:49:02,365
Speaker 11:  For my own sanity and just to teach myself that like the streak is not,

741
00:49:02,585 --> 00:49:06,485
Speaker 11:  the streak is not how I define my consistency. Because like I can

742
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:09,765
Speaker 11:  tell you for the last six years, I haven't gone a week without running or

743
00:49:09,795 --> 00:49:13,565
Speaker 11:  some sort of physical exercise. So I would say that I am consistent in my

744
00:49:13,565 --> 00:49:17,365
Speaker 11:  fitness routine, but you know, life and I'll get a little vulnerable with

745
00:49:17,365 --> 00:49:21,045
Speaker 11:  everybody. My life has not been super easy the last few years

746
00:49:21,115 --> 00:49:25,045
Speaker 11:  just because I've had a lot of like circumstances, namely my entire immediate

747
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:29,005
Speaker 11:  family died like kind of one after another. And when you go

748
00:49:29,005 --> 00:49:32,685
Speaker 11:  through those life circumstances, the last thing you need is the Apple Watch

749
00:49:32,685 --> 00:49:36,125
Speaker 11:  going, you didn't close two of your rings yesterday.

750
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:40,125
Speaker 11:  What happened? And you're like, well, well Apple Watch, there was a funeral

751
00:49:40,315 --> 00:49:43,685
Speaker 11:  yesterday. That's what happened. Yeah. I did not go

752
00:49:44,345 --> 00:49:48,125
Speaker 11:  and train my little legs out because I was not

753
00:49:48,125 --> 00:49:51,645
Speaker 11:  having a good day that day. So, you know, I think having that

754
00:49:51,675 --> 00:49:55,565
Speaker 11:  flexibility, allowing that to be within the Alpha watch and then to also

755
00:49:55,565 --> 00:49:58,965
Speaker 11:  have the other fitness features that they introduced, like training load,

756
00:49:59,255 --> 00:50:02,645
Speaker 11:  which, you know, that's not new. Garmin's had that for forever. All like

757
00:50:02,645 --> 00:50:06,485
Speaker 11:  the polars have had that forever. But just like the acknowledgement that

758
00:50:06,485 --> 00:50:10,325
Speaker 11:  there are going to be times where you should not push it, where you should

759
00:50:10,515 --> 00:50:14,485
Speaker 11:  ease off the gas and that overall that will be good for you is is

760
00:50:14,485 --> 00:50:16,365
Speaker 11:  just like, I'm just like, yes.

761
00:50:17,065 --> 00:50:20,645
Speaker 1:  Yes. Well, yeah, that, that context is a really interesting way to think

762
00:50:20,645 --> 00:50:23,685
Speaker 1:  about all of the watch stuff. And like you said, I think the, the Apple watch,

763
00:50:24,025 --> 00:50:26,925
Speaker 1:  we pay attention to it more than most smart watches, but we should because

764
00:50:27,045 --> 00:50:30,205
Speaker 1:  it, it, it, it is the one sort of driving this whole industry in a lot of

765
00:50:30,205 --> 00:50:33,885
Speaker 1:  ways. It really feels like a sort of vibe shift in the Apple

766
00:50:33,885 --> 00:50:37,725
Speaker 1:  watch from like, how do we get you to do more and

767
00:50:37,835 --> 00:50:41,645
Speaker 1:  turn everyone into super athletes and, and put more and more and more

768
00:50:41,675 --> 00:50:44,645
Speaker 1:  data into here? And there's still some of that, right? and it's like if you

769
00:50:44,645 --> 00:50:48,285
Speaker 1:  want to know all of the teeny tiny details of your body, like the watch is

770
00:50:48,285 --> 00:50:51,325
Speaker 1:  getting better and better at that. But at the same time there is this recognition

771
00:50:51,325 --> 00:50:54,605
Speaker 1:  of like, okay, actually maybe the watch's job as it starts to understand

772
00:50:54,605 --> 00:50:58,365
Speaker 1:  you better is to help you not push you. And that those are not the same

773
00:50:58,365 --> 00:50:59,285
Speaker 1:  thing. The

774
00:50:59,445 --> 00:51:03,405
Speaker 11:  Struggle that every single smart watch or fitness tracker has that no other

775
00:51:03,405 --> 00:51:06,925
Speaker 11:  gadget device has is that it is trying to affect behavioral change.

776
00:51:07,385 --> 00:51:11,085
Speaker 11:  And behavioral change is very difficult. We are very

777
00:51:11,085 --> 00:51:14,685
Speaker 11:  ingrained in our habits and building a new habit doesn't actually take

778
00:51:14,685 --> 00:51:18,565
Speaker 11:  21 days. Like some people say it can take 21 days, it could take 66, it

779
00:51:18,565 --> 00:51:22,285
Speaker 11:  could take half a year. So like building change like that,

780
00:51:22,285 --> 00:51:25,645
Speaker 11:  especially when it's physical activity and exercise, which is notoriously,

781
00:51:25,865 --> 00:51:29,485
Speaker 11:  you know, we are not like evolution has not made us crave

782
00:51:29,845 --> 00:51:33,245
Speaker 11:  exercise. If anything, evolution has made us crave the couch and a bag of

783
00:51:33,245 --> 00:51:36,725
Speaker 11:  potato chips because you know, that's, that's just how it is. And so even

784
00:51:36,725 --> 00:51:40,485
Speaker 11:  though you know it's good for you, you know, there are

785
00:51:40,485 --> 00:51:44,165
Speaker 11:  people who love streaks. There are people who love gamification. There are

786
00:51:44,165 --> 00:51:48,085
Speaker 11:  signs that gamification does work to an extent. There are also people

787
00:51:48,085 --> 00:51:51,925
Speaker 11:  like me who are just like bundles of anxiety and nerves

788
00:51:52,105 --> 00:51:56,005
Speaker 11:  and full of burnout. The world is full of things that will make you

789
00:51:56,005 --> 00:51:59,965
Speaker 11:  burnout. Streaks for me personally, are a source of burnout.

790
00:52:00,145 --> 00:52:03,725
Speaker 11:  If I am chasing a streak, that is how I've gotten every single running

791
00:52:03,825 --> 00:52:07,285
Speaker 11:  injury in the past two, three years. That's how I've gotten my calf injuries.

792
00:52:07,285 --> 00:52:10,325
Speaker 11:  That's how I've gotten shin splints. It has been trying to keep streaks

793
00:52:10,325 --> 00:52:14,285
Speaker 11:  going counter to like my achilles tendon or my calf or whatever,

794
00:52:14,285 --> 00:52:18,125
Speaker 11:  saying like, we're a little ouchie right now. Could you take a, could

795
00:52:18,285 --> 00:52:22,085
Speaker 11:  you take a break? Could you walk instead of going on a six mile

796
00:52:22,145 --> 00:52:26,085
Speaker 11:  run? And I'd be like, no body, I will, I will, I have a streak to

797
00:52:26,365 --> 00:52:26,565
Speaker 11:  maintain.

798
00:52:27,005 --> 00:52:30,045
Speaker 1:  I wish they had just called it like, leave me alone. That's all I want from

799
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:33,245
Speaker 1:  the activity thing is every time it sends a notification, one of the buttons

800
00:52:33,245 --> 00:52:36,605
Speaker 1:  should just be leave me alone. And then it's just, it's just like, my bad,

801
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:39,885
Speaker 1:  sorry, I'll leave you alone. And then it comes back the next day and it iss

802
00:52:39,885 --> 00:52:43,725
Speaker 1:  like, are we cool now? Can we, can we hang out? Like that's, that's the relationship

803
00:52:43,765 --> 00:52:44,765
Speaker 1:  I wanna have with my Apple watch.

804
00:52:44,965 --> 00:52:45,565
Speaker 11:  I mean same

805
00:52:45,785 --> 00:52:49,045
Speaker 1:  Before we move on, anything else about watchOS 11 that got you particularly

806
00:52:49,045 --> 00:52:49,405
Speaker 1:  excited

807
00:52:49,675 --> 00:52:53,165
Speaker 11:  Live activities? I think that's really fun and cool. I kind of wanna see

808
00:52:53,185 --> 00:52:56,885
Speaker 11:  how well it does. 'cause it really depends on the

809
00:52:56,885 --> 00:53:00,805
Speaker 11:  intelligence being able to tell or suggest a really

810
00:53:00,835 --> 00:53:04,605
Speaker 11:  cool thing to you while the live activities are going. But I'm very

811
00:53:04,605 --> 00:53:06,845
Speaker 11:  curious to see how that plays out on, on the wrist.

812
00:53:07,275 --> 00:53:11,125
Speaker 1:  Yeah, that that's a good one. So, okay, competitor time. All

813
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:14,845
Speaker 1:  of these I would say are the, the ones trying to do Android Apple

814
00:53:14,845 --> 00:53:17,525
Speaker 1:  watches. There are going to be people who don't like that description, but

815
00:53:17,525 --> 00:53:19,085
Speaker 1:  that is what is going on. It's,

816
00:53:19,085 --> 00:53:20,285
Speaker 11:  It's what they're doing, it's just what

817
00:53:20,285 --> 00:53:24,085
Speaker 1:  It is. Let's start with The. Pixel Watch. So we got both some new stuff for

818
00:53:24,085 --> 00:53:27,685
Speaker 1:  The Pixel Watch two and some leaks for The Pixel Watch three.

819
00:53:28,845 --> 00:53:31,445
Speaker 1:  Anything exciting for you in in Pixel Watch land right now?

820
00:53:32,045 --> 00:53:35,885
Speaker 11:  I think bigger Pixel watch, like the rumor is that it's going to be called

821
00:53:36,335 --> 00:53:40,085
Speaker 11:  Pixel Watch xl. So just I, I'm, I'm

822
00:53:40,115 --> 00:53:44,085
Speaker 11:  praying for my future self in a video going The Pixel Watch three

823
00:53:44,225 --> 00:53:46,725
Speaker 11:  xl, if that's actually what they're calling it. 'cause that's a mouthful.

824
00:53:47,385 --> 00:53:51,365
Speaker 11:  But just in terms of that is the biggest complaint that we

825
00:53:51,425 --> 00:53:54,925
Speaker 11:  had with The Pixel Watch two is that it was only one size and

826
00:53:55,415 --> 00:53:58,725
Speaker 11:  ironically it was the smaller size and so people were like, we want a bigger

827
00:53:58,745 --> 00:54:02,685
Speaker 11:  one. When historically smartwatch size complaints have been, this is

828
00:54:02,745 --> 00:54:06,645
Speaker 11:  too big, this is too bulky, make one smaller.

829
00:54:06,865 --> 00:54:10,365
Speaker 11:  So this is like an ongoing conflict that we've had.

830
00:54:10,745 --> 00:54:14,325
Speaker 11:  But I think it just kind of shows that you really can't do one size fits

831
00:54:14,345 --> 00:54:17,805
Speaker 11:  all with smart watches. So for them to have a bigger size, I'm stoked for

832
00:54:17,805 --> 00:54:21,765
Speaker 11:  people. I had a lot of readers just be like, but I have a bigger arm and

833
00:54:21,785 --> 00:54:25,485
Speaker 11:  The Pixel Watch looks stupid on it. and it was like, you know what? Fair,

834
00:54:25,625 --> 00:54:29,485
Speaker 1:  Purely anecdotally, I will say I see Apple Watch Ultras everywhere,

835
00:54:29,795 --> 00:54:33,645
Speaker 1:  like in much higher volume than I expected. 'cause it's a, it's a big

836
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:37,205
Speaker 1:  watch but I see them everywhere on people of all

837
00:54:37,455 --> 00:54:40,925
Speaker 1:  sizes and all fashion senses. Like the

838
00:54:40,925 --> 00:54:44,765
Speaker 1:  willingness to do the big watch I guess for extra Battery and some extra

839
00:54:44,965 --> 00:54:48,645
Speaker 1:  features like way more of that than I expected when the Ultra came out. Are

840
00:54:48,645 --> 00:54:50,085
Speaker 1:  you wearing an ultra right now? Is that what I just saw

841
00:54:50,445 --> 00:54:51,765
Speaker 11:  That that is an ultra tube

842
00:54:51,865 --> 00:54:54,285
Speaker 1:  And you are not what I would call a large armed person. I

843
00:54:54,285 --> 00:54:58,245
Speaker 11:  Am not a large armed person. I have very tiny bird wrists. But what I

844
00:54:58,245 --> 00:55:01,965
Speaker 11:  will say is that I have been acclimatized to really big watches

845
00:55:02,525 --> 00:55:05,925
Speaker 11:  over the years wearing a lot of garments. So I'm kind of used to the weight

846
00:55:05,985 --> 00:55:09,845
Speaker 11:  at this point. But also my eyesight is so notoriously bad

847
00:55:09,875 --> 00:55:13,245
Speaker 11:  that people keep asking me like, why is your iPhone on the largest font

848
00:55:13,605 --> 00:55:17,565
Speaker 11:  possible? It's like, 'cause I can't read well and the Ultra has

849
00:55:17,645 --> 00:55:20,965
Speaker 11:  a gigantic excrete. Eli has made fun of me many times. He's like, you know,

850
00:55:21,045 --> 00:55:24,645
Speaker 11:  I can read everything on your Apple Watch. And it's like, yes, yes.

851
00:55:24,865 --> 00:55:27,325
Speaker 11:  And you know what, so can I And that's the point.

852
00:55:27,385 --> 00:55:29,165
Speaker 1:  That's the dream. Yeah, that's

853
00:55:29,165 --> 00:55:29,485
Speaker 11:  The dream.

854
00:55:29,745 --> 00:55:33,605
Speaker 1:  No, I agree. I think, I think the bigger pixel watch will be a

855
00:55:33,605 --> 00:55:37,565
Speaker 1:  victory if only again, because it's just more options. And I feel like for

856
00:55:37,585 --> 00:55:41,525
Speaker 1:  me, The, Pixel Watch yes kind of landed in the right zone. It's like

857
00:55:41,525 --> 00:55:45,365
Speaker 1:  about the size I want a smartwatch to be and I like the round,

858
00:55:45,365 --> 00:55:49,005
Speaker 1:  like I was very happy even with the first one. But you're absolutely right

859
00:55:49,005 --> 00:55:52,685
Speaker 1:  that the only way to do this is to have lots of them because people are different

860
00:55:52,905 --> 00:55:56,245
Speaker 1:  and it's like it gets all the weirder when you get to glasses and we'll talk

861
00:55:56,245 --> 00:55:58,445
Speaker 1:  about that another day. But like this is just where we are now.

862
00:55:58,625 --> 00:56:01,365
Speaker 11:  The other thing with The Pixel Watch that it's like a very small thing,

863
00:56:01,385 --> 00:56:05,045
Speaker 11:  but for me as a wearable reviewer, I went, huh is the fact that Car

864
00:56:05,045 --> 00:56:08,125
Speaker 11:  Crashes detection is coming to The Pixel Watch too, because we don't have

865
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:11,205
Speaker 11:  that on Android yet. And I was like, is this the first time that we're gonna

866
00:56:11,205 --> 00:56:15,085
Speaker 11:  have car crash detection on a smartwatch on Android and yes, yes it

867
00:56:15,085 --> 00:56:18,845
Speaker 11:  is. So that I think is significant in the sense that like, you know,

868
00:56:18,845 --> 00:56:22,485
Speaker 11:  Google was starting so far behind Apple and so far behind Samsung

869
00:56:22,635 --> 00:56:26,045
Speaker 11:  when The Pixel Watch was launched like soon to be three years ago.

870
00:56:26,465 --> 00:56:30,405
Speaker 11:  So a lot of the times when we get these new features, it's like, eh, it's

871
00:56:30,405 --> 00:56:33,685
Speaker 11:  been, it's been done already. And yes, that is true. This is still true

872
00:56:33,755 --> 00:56:37,645
Speaker 11:  here, but the gap is getting smaller. And for me I'm like,

873
00:56:37,705 --> 00:56:41,565
Speaker 11:  yes, finally the gap is getting smaller. I'm so excited about that.

874
00:56:41,785 --> 00:56:45,485
Speaker 11:  So like that's just like a tiny thing because Samsung doesn't have car crash

875
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:49,245
Speaker 11:  detection for its watches yet. So for Google to be like, Hey

876
00:56:49,345 --> 00:56:49,925
Speaker 11:  we got this.

877
00:56:51,035 --> 00:56:52,125
Speaker 1:  It's progress. Yeah,

878
00:56:52,125 --> 00:56:55,405
Speaker 11:  It's progress. Yeah. And I'm excited to see, it's just like a very small

879
00:56:55,405 --> 00:56:56,405
Speaker 11:  thing that I'm excited to see.

880
00:56:56,835 --> 00:56:59,925
Speaker 1:  Yeah, no it's, it's a good one. And I think you're right that Google

881
00:57:00,315 --> 00:57:04,165
Speaker 1:  basically just systematically doing Apple Watch things is the correct

882
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:07,645
Speaker 1:  thing to do, especially if then it can turn around and be like, oh now it

883
00:57:07,645 --> 00:57:10,125
Speaker 1:  has all the Gemini stuff and we're gonna finally figure out Fitbit. Even

884
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:13,005
Speaker 1:  though I've essentially given up on the possibility of the Fitbit integration

885
00:57:13,005 --> 00:57:15,765
Speaker 1:  ever making any sense, it won't, You can see the path. This is the thing

886
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:19,125
Speaker 1:  about The Pixel Watch that drives me so crazy. You can see the path to it

887
00:57:19,125 --> 00:57:23,005
Speaker 1:  being great and I'm, I'm, I'm hopeful at least

888
00:57:23,005 --> 00:57:26,205
Speaker 1:  that Google still seems to care about it. So that's something. But the Fitbit

889
00:57:26,205 --> 00:57:28,205
Speaker 1:  thing will never stop driving either of us crazy. I

890
00:57:28,205 --> 00:57:31,605
Speaker 11:  Don't think it's one can pray, one can pray.

891
00:57:31,955 --> 00:57:35,645
Speaker 1:  Yeah, that's enough about Fitbit on this particular podcast. Let's talk about

892
00:57:35,645 --> 00:57:38,685
Speaker 1:  Samsung for a minute. You brought up Samsung, it's the one with the new watch

893
00:57:38,835 --> 00:57:42,645
Speaker 1:  that was the, the news of I think last week. Now the Galaxy Watch

894
00:57:42,945 --> 00:57:45,805
Speaker 1:  Fe, anything exciting there? It's cheaper. Yay. For cheaper.

895
00:57:46,155 --> 00:57:49,525
Speaker 11:  It's cheaper. Which, you know, that's notable because the last two years

896
00:57:49,525 --> 00:57:53,405
Speaker 11:  we've seen price increases for the base Galaxy Watch five and the six

897
00:57:53,405 --> 00:57:57,325
Speaker 11:  because inflation, yeah, Samsung's not immune. And that

898
00:57:57,425 --> 00:58:01,125
Speaker 11:  was kind of sad at the time because you know, the Galaxy Watch has

899
00:58:01,325 --> 00:58:05,205
Speaker 11:  historically been kind of competitively priced underpriced for

900
00:58:05,205 --> 00:58:08,125
Speaker 11:  what it is. So it would just be like, oh yeah, you could get the base model

901
00:58:08,625 --> 00:58:12,125
Speaker 11:  for less than $300 and that's pretty, it's pretty solid.

902
00:58:13,045 --> 00:58:16,965
Speaker 11:  And that's like not really the case anymore. It's, I I believe it's about

903
00:58:16,965 --> 00:58:20,325
Speaker 11:  300 now for the base model. So to get the fe, which is

904
00:58:20,345 --> 00:58:24,245
Speaker 11:  1 99 for the Bluetooth only version, that's a solid $200

905
00:58:24,415 --> 00:58:28,325
Speaker 11:  watch, which you know the, the Apple Watch SE is two 50.

906
00:58:28,785 --> 00:58:32,365
Speaker 11:  So starting price. So you're looking at that and you're like, oh okay, okay.

907
00:58:32,985 --> 00:58:36,965
Speaker 11:  But what it really is is that it's a Rebadged Galaxy

908
00:58:36,965 --> 00:58:40,045
Speaker 11:  Watch four. So that's kind of interesting. Interesting. Okay. Like spec

909
00:58:40,045 --> 00:58:43,885
Speaker 11:  wise, spec wise, you are getting the last gen chip and

910
00:58:44,005 --> 00:58:47,085
Speaker 11:  I think once you kind of look at the specs you're like, oh, you're not really

911
00:58:47,085 --> 00:58:51,045
Speaker 11:  giving that much up. But at the same time it's not that exciting

912
00:58:51,325 --> 00:58:55,085
Speaker 11:  because the, the design is very similar. So what are we

913
00:58:55,405 --> 00:58:59,285
Speaker 11:  actually looking here and we are looking at Samsung once again throwing

914
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:03,165
Speaker 11:  spaghetti at the wall with its lineup and trying to figure out what the

915
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:07,005
Speaker 11:  hell's gonna work. And I think they're identifying very realistically that,

916
00:59:07,145 --> 00:59:11,005
Speaker 11:  you know, apple does kind of have a winning combination by having a

917
00:59:11,055 --> 00:59:14,125
Speaker 11:  entry level watch for kids and for elderly

918
00:59:15,045 --> 00:59:18,485
Speaker 11:  relatives that people use it for having the base model and then just having

919
00:59:18,515 --> 00:59:22,205
Speaker 11:  this massive ultra for people who want the

920
00:59:22,275 --> 00:59:26,205
Speaker 11:  bestest and the greatest and are like imagining themselves to be

921
00:59:26,365 --> 00:59:30,325
Speaker 11:  hardcore elite athletes or maybe they are hardcore elite athletes. And I

922
00:59:30,325 --> 00:59:33,365
Speaker 11:  think what we can tell from leaks so far is that Samsung is very much

923
00:59:33,805 --> 00:59:37,245
Speaker 11:  aligning itself to kind of have the same lineup. So we have the

924
00:59:37,585 --> 00:59:41,125
Speaker 11:  Fe now and I think it's very telling that that's coming ahead of

925
00:59:41,205 --> 00:59:44,245
Speaker 11:  unpacked because we're, we're gonna have the

926
00:59:44,575 --> 00:59:48,525
Speaker 11:  ostensibly the Galaxy Watch seven and then the Galaxy Watch Ultra

927
00:59:49,105 --> 00:59:52,165
Speaker 11:  is I think the rumored name for it. It's this

928
00:59:52,885 --> 00:59:55,765
Speaker 11:  squirkle looking thing from the leaks on the renders that we've seen.

929
00:59:56,885 --> 01:00:00,525
Speaker 11:  I don't think it like Galaxy Watch, Fe Galaxy Watch

930
01:00:00,695 --> 01:00:04,565
Speaker 11:  Ultra, I think we can point to the other company that they're kind of

931
01:00:04,565 --> 01:00:07,045
Speaker 11:  taking, let's say inspiration from, they're

932
01:00:07,045 --> 01:00:08,325
Speaker 1:  Just leaning into it. They're

933
01:00:08,325 --> 01:00:11,285
Speaker 11:  Just leaning into it. And I don't think it's a wrong move. I think it, I

934
01:00:11,285 --> 01:00:14,485
Speaker 11:  think it's actually quite smart to kind of position themselves as, like

935
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:18,245
Speaker 11:  you say the Android of the Apple watch of

936
01:00:18,315 --> 01:00:21,325
Speaker 11:  Android is kind of what they're fashioning themselves as. They're just kind

937
01:00:21,325 --> 01:00:24,805
Speaker 11:  of leaning into that. Again, some people are gonna be upset about that.

938
01:00:25,045 --> 01:00:27,285
Speaker 11:  I don't think they really should be, there

939
01:00:27,285 --> 01:00:30,045
Speaker 1:  Are worse things to be at this, at this particular moment in time. I

940
01:00:30,045 --> 01:00:32,845
Speaker 11:  Think they're just kind of going, I think this is what people want. We'll

941
01:00:32,845 --> 01:00:36,085
Speaker 11:  give them what they want and then on top of that we're expecting the Galaxy

942
01:00:36,115 --> 01:00:40,005
Speaker 11:  ring. So that's one way that Samsung can go like, haha, suck it,

943
01:00:40,005 --> 01:00:43,845
Speaker 11:  Google, suck it Apple, we got something that you don't, and it's a Galaxy

944
01:00:43,845 --> 01:00:47,805
Speaker 11:  ring. And so I'm really, I'm really stoked

945
01:00:47,805 --> 01:00:51,165
Speaker 11:  and excited to see what that's gonna look like, especially since they

946
01:00:51,245 --> 01:00:53,445
Speaker 11:  preemptively sued Aura. This

947
01:00:53,445 --> 01:00:55,685
Speaker 1:  Was the next thing I wanted to talk about, which

948
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:59,165
Speaker 11:  To me was just like, ooh, okay, that's fun.

949
01:00:59,885 --> 01:01:03,725
Speaker 11:  I just got a new smart ring in the mail. I'm currently wearing three,

950
01:01:04,305 --> 01:01:08,245
Speaker 11:  yes, I'm wearing three at the moment so I'll be wearing four just to

951
01:01:08,245 --> 01:01:11,965
Speaker 11:  get like, so I know all the competitors when it ever it is, I'm

952
01:01:12,325 --> 01:01:16,245
Speaker 11:  very excited to see how that goes down for Aura because this is

953
01:01:16,265 --> 01:01:20,125
Speaker 11:  the, this is the first time I think that they've had a competitor that could

954
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:23,485
Speaker 11:  really, you know, let's, let's be real. 'cause really fuck up their, you

955
01:01:23,485 --> 01:01:26,325
Speaker 11:  know, the thing that they've had for a long time. They've been going out

956
01:01:26,385 --> 01:01:29,845
Speaker 11:  and you know this, this Samsung case, the patent case. They were just like,

957
01:01:30,025 --> 01:01:33,845
Speaker 11:  listen, you done sued Ring Con, you done

958
01:01:33,995 --> 01:01:37,885
Speaker 11:  sued Ultra Human, you done sued Circular, that's the

959
01:01:37,885 --> 01:01:41,525
Speaker 11:  other one. And Samsung just came out and they're like, yeah, we see what

960
01:01:41,525 --> 01:01:45,485
Speaker 11:  you're doing. You have this pattern of just suing people for doing what

961
01:01:45,525 --> 01:01:49,285
Speaker 11:  a smart ring ought to do. So we just wanna preemptively say that

962
01:01:49,485 --> 01:01:53,125
Speaker 11:  we're not infringing on your patents so you can't sue us, which

963
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:55,925
Speaker 1:  Is an amazing lawsuit to file by the way. Very good.

964
01:01:56,205 --> 01:01:59,085
Speaker 11:  I just can't wait to see what happens because Samsung doing that, that's

965
01:01:59,085 --> 01:02:02,605
Speaker 11:  gonna set a precedent for the other smaller companies. I would be a little

966
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:06,645
Speaker 11:  stressed if I was Aura and You can tell they are stressed because they

967
01:02:06,645 --> 01:02:10,405
Speaker 11:  just keep dropping features. They keep coming

968
01:02:10,465 --> 01:02:13,285
Speaker 11:  out and being like, we got this new thing and we got this other thing You

969
01:02:13,285 --> 01:02:16,405
Speaker 11:  can, we can tell how old your heart is now we can do this and we have science.

970
01:02:16,665 --> 01:02:19,885
Speaker 11:  And so I'm just really interested to see how that

971
01:02:20,335 --> 01:02:22,565
Speaker 11:  drama is gonna play out over the next few months.

972
01:02:22,755 --> 01:02:26,445
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I'm really excited about the Galaxy Ring in particular. I think it's,

973
01:02:26,445 --> 01:02:29,845
Speaker 1:  it's shaping up to be a pretty fun year for watches in that I think to your

974
01:02:29,845 --> 01:02:33,645
Speaker 1:  point, we're gonna have three pretty competitive lineups of

975
01:02:33,645 --> 01:02:36,685
Speaker 1:  smart watches if all of the leaks and stuff come true, which I think is very

976
01:02:36,845 --> 01:02:40,565
Speaker 1:  exciting. But I think the Galaxy ring is going to be really the

977
01:02:40,565 --> 01:02:44,125
Speaker 1:  first like mainstream walk into an

978
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:47,125
Speaker 1:  electronic store and it's going to be on a shelf in front of you from a company

979
01:02:47,125 --> 01:02:50,925
Speaker 1:  you've heard of Smart Ring and I think that's very exciting and from what

980
01:02:50,925 --> 01:02:54,565
Speaker 1:  we've seen so far, it seems to look nice and it's not

981
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:58,045
Speaker 1:  humongous. Like I actually have pretty high hopes for this thing and I think

982
01:02:58,545 --> 01:03:02,285
Speaker 1:  if it's good we might start to see this market take off pretty

983
01:03:02,315 --> 01:03:02,605
Speaker 1:  fast.

984
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:07,125
Speaker 11:  I, I think so if it is, I wanna say 50% as good as what the

985
01:03:07,155 --> 01:03:10,685
Speaker 11:  Aura Ring is, is bringing to the table with the convenience of just like

986
01:03:10,685 --> 01:03:14,285
Speaker 11:  integrating with your Samsung products already. If I was

987
01:03:14,475 --> 01:03:16,165
Speaker 11:  Aura I would be scared.

988
01:03:16,925 --> 01:03:17,965
Speaker 1:  V thank you as always,

989
01:03:18,225 --> 01:03:19,325
Speaker 11:  Thanks for having break.

990
01:03:19,995 --> 01:03:22,845
Speaker 1:  Alright, we gotta take one more break and then we're gonna do a question

991
01:03:22,845 --> 01:03:23,885
Speaker 1:  from the Vergecast hotline.

992
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:58,845
Speaker 14:  weather this month and once again I am looking outside at a

993
01:05:58,845 --> 01:06:02,365
Speaker 14:  thunderstorm and my weather app says it's sunny.

994
01:06:02,665 --> 01:06:06,525
Speaker 14:  So the Apple weather app is just terrible. And

995
01:06:06,715 --> 01:06:10,285
Speaker 14:  ever since Apple bought Blue Sky, I have just been

996
01:06:10,285 --> 01:06:14,245
Speaker 14:  struggling for a good app that doesn't sell my privacy. So I'm

997
01:06:14,245 --> 01:06:17,645
Speaker 14:  wondering if The Verge has a 2024

998
01:06:17,745 --> 01:06:21,085
Speaker 14:  recommendation on a good solid

999
01:06:21,275 --> 01:06:25,085
Speaker 14:  weather app on the iPhone that doesn't sell my privacy

1000
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:28,365
Speaker 14:  away. I hope to hear your answers on air. Thanks

1001
01:06:29,135 --> 01:06:32,725
Speaker 1:  Steve. You have come to the right place. I am here to tell you you have come

1002
01:06:32,725 --> 01:06:36,645
Speaker 1:  to the right place. Liam James is here. Liam, is it fair to say you are the

1003
01:06:36,725 --> 01:06:40,205
Speaker 1:  verges preeminent weather nerd? Like is that a fair accusation?

1004
01:06:40,765 --> 01:06:44,365
Speaker 9:  I would say I am doing my best to, to fill the very large shoes

1005
01:06:44,545 --> 01:06:47,965
Speaker 9:  of Dan Seaford, but I, I am very into the weather.

1006
01:06:48,415 --> 01:06:50,085
Speaker 1:  How's the weather station? First of all?

1007
01:06:50,305 --> 01:06:54,245
Speaker 9:  The weather station is doing great. It's still same batteries installed

1008
01:06:54,265 --> 01:06:58,165
Speaker 9:  on the, the roof of my New York City apartment building illegally,

1009
01:06:58,465 --> 01:07:01,885
Speaker 9:  but still sending a signal down to my weather station I. love it. So

1010
01:07:01,885 --> 01:07:05,565
Speaker 1:  Part of the reason I brought you on here is that I, I wonder if we are going

1011
01:07:05,565 --> 01:07:08,925
Speaker 1:  to get to a point where we tell people that the best thing you should do

1012
01:07:08,925 --> 01:07:12,805
Speaker 1:  in order to get a good forecast is install a weather station on your roof

1013
01:07:12,955 --> 01:07:16,605
Speaker 1:  like a maniac. Is this a reasonable recommendation you would give to people?

1014
01:07:17,345 --> 01:07:21,325
Speaker 9:  No. Okay. It is a completely ridiculous situation, but what can I

1015
01:07:21,325 --> 01:07:24,445
Speaker 9:  say? I love gadgets. It all started with our Father's Day gift guide. So

1016
01:07:24,445 --> 01:07:27,965
Speaker 9:  really, I mean we've created our own, our own problem to

1017
01:07:27,965 --> 01:07:31,845
Speaker 1:  Solve here. This is what we do. Okay. So I have two things I wanna talk

1018
01:07:31,845 --> 01:07:35,285
Speaker 1:  about here. One is that, and, and I think you and I are gonna agree on this,

1019
01:07:35,425 --> 01:07:39,245
Speaker 1:  the single best and most important piece of advice that I can give you here

1020
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:43,045
Speaker 1:  is a website called Forecast Advisor. Yes. Which people don't know about

1021
01:07:43,185 --> 01:07:47,005
Speaker 1:  and people should know about. You go and you plug in either your zip code

1022
01:07:47,025 --> 01:07:51,005
Speaker 1:  or your city and your state and it will tell you which of the many

1023
01:07:51,115 --> 01:07:54,725
Speaker 1:  data sources that exist is most accurate historically

1024
01:07:55,145 --> 01:07:58,085
Speaker 1:  for where you are. Do you use this, Liam? Have you ever, have you ever run

1025
01:07:58,085 --> 01:07:58,845
Speaker 1:  this test on yourself?

1026
01:07:59,105 --> 01:08:02,885
Speaker 9:  Oh absolutely. Okay. I believe it was actually Dan Seaford who introduced

1027
01:08:02,885 --> 01:08:06,605
Speaker 9:  me to this, but yeah, it's not the app so much as it is the

1028
01:08:06,605 --> 01:08:08,685
Speaker 9:  source of data your app is pulling from.

1029
01:08:08,915 --> 01:08:12,445
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So, okay, let's just, let's just do this live for our buddy Steve here.

1030
01:08:12,825 --> 01:08:15,645
Speaker 1:  So we'll go to, we'll go to Forecast Advisor dot com, we type in Dallas,

1031
01:08:15,655 --> 01:08:19,405
Speaker 1:  Texas where it is currently as we are recording this 95 degrees.

1032
01:08:19,625 --> 01:08:23,285
Speaker 1:  Oof. Steve, I'm so, so sorry. And what this says

1033
01:08:23,705 --> 01:08:27,405
Speaker 1:  is that for the last month, so May, 2024,

1034
01:08:27,985 --> 01:08:31,925
Speaker 1:  the NWS, the National Weather Service Digital Forecast was the most accurate

1035
01:08:31,995 --> 01:08:35,925
Speaker 1:  data source at 71.86% of forecast.

1036
01:08:36,485 --> 01:08:40,445
Speaker 1:  A low number says a lot about forecast that the best one is

1037
01:08:40,445 --> 01:08:44,285
Speaker 1:  only 71% accurate. There are three here that are

1038
01:08:44,425 --> 01:08:48,045
Speaker 1:  all basically identical. They're all 71 point something percent

1039
01:08:48,325 --> 01:08:51,485
Speaker 1:  accurate. It's the National Weather Service, the Weather Channel, and Aris

1040
01:08:51,485 --> 01:08:54,285
Speaker 1:  weather. And then it goes all the way down to, like, the reason this is good

1041
01:08:54,425 --> 01:08:55,245
Speaker 1:  is let's say there are

1042
01:08:55,265 --> 01:08:58,965
Speaker 1:  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 other ones

1043
01:08:59,425 --> 01:09:02,525
Speaker 1:  and the one all the way at the bottom, which is called persistence was only

1044
01:09:02,525 --> 01:09:06,405
Speaker 1:  right 45.71% of the time. So this is like you are looking

1045
01:09:06,405 --> 01:09:09,205
Speaker 1:  at a weather forecast that is literally only half accurate.

1046
01:09:09,965 --> 01:09:13,605
Speaker 9:  I believe the current Apple built-in Weather app

1047
01:09:13,715 --> 01:09:17,205
Speaker 9:  uses the Weather Channel. If I'm correct, what, what was the score for the

1048
01:09:17,205 --> 01:09:18,485
Speaker 9:  Weather Channel in Dallas, Texas?

1049
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:21,125
Speaker 1:  So that's second on the list here at

1050
01:09:21,125 --> 01:09:23,005
Speaker 1:  71.51%

1051
01:09:23,585 --> 01:09:25,925
Speaker 9:  Second at 71% not

1052
01:09:25,925 --> 01:09:28,045
Speaker 1:  So great. Yeah, it's, it's tough. Well what's interesting about this though

1053
01:09:28,045 --> 01:09:32,005
Speaker 1:  is one of the things that Forecast Advisor shows, I think, and I'm, I'm

1054
01:09:32,005 --> 01:09:35,645
Speaker 1:  extrapolating a little bit here, but if you look at it over the last year,

1055
01:09:35,785 --> 01:09:39,725
Speaker 1:  and again we're still in Dallas Access, Microsoft, I don't know what

1056
01:09:39,725 --> 01:09:42,925
Speaker 1:  it just says Microsoft, which is apparently a weather source was accurate

1057
01:09:42,925 --> 01:09:46,805
Speaker 1:  84% of the time. So what it seems like is what we just had in

1058
01:09:46,865 --> 01:09:50,645
Speaker 1:  May might have been like an extra volatile month of

1059
01:09:50,645 --> 01:09:54,405
Speaker 1:  weather, especially in Dallas, Texas. But like, let's, let's look where you

1060
01:09:54,405 --> 01:09:57,805
Speaker 1:  are, Liam, you're in New York. New York for you it's the Weather channel

1061
01:09:57,985 --> 01:10:01,885
Speaker 1:  is number 180 3 0.6%. So yeah, Dallas just has some wonky

1062
01:10:01,885 --> 01:10:04,045
Speaker 1:  weather going on. Everybody's struggling with Dallas.

1063
01:10:04,635 --> 01:10:08,405
Speaker 9:  Yeah, it's usually in my experience 'cause I've, I've used this service

1064
01:10:08,585 --> 01:10:12,565
Speaker 9:  in many cities and the National Weather Service is not usually your

1065
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:13,605
Speaker 9:  top pick for

1066
01:10:13,605 --> 01:10:16,605
Speaker 1:  You. The National Weather Service is like fully halfway down the list.

1067
01:10:16,995 --> 01:10:20,845
Speaker 9:  Yeah, it's, it's, I I was surprised to see that be the topic for

1068
01:10:20,845 --> 01:10:24,685
Speaker 9:  Dallas, but yeah, it's, it's not the app you're using so

1069
01:10:24,805 --> 01:10:28,405
Speaker 9:  much. It is the source. Some of the more nerdy weather apps

1070
01:10:28,515 --> 01:10:32,405
Speaker 9:  will allow you to pick from a list of sources. I use the nerdiest of

1071
01:10:32,405 --> 01:10:36,365
Speaker 9:  all iOS weather apps, which is carrot weather and it, it has a

1072
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:40,285
Speaker 9:  list of, it looks like almost a dozen sources here for me

1073
01:10:40,285 --> 01:10:41,325
Speaker 9:  to choose from. So

1074
01:10:41,325 --> 01:10:45,205
Speaker 1:  Carrot was one of the ones I was, I was gonna bring up because it is a

1075
01:10:45,205 --> 01:10:49,085
Speaker 1:  beloved app and it's also, I would say, like

1076
01:10:49,085 --> 01:10:52,765
Speaker 1:  you said, maybe the wonkiest of weather apps just in terms of like the

1077
01:10:52,765 --> 01:10:56,485
Speaker 1:  amount of stuff that You can see. If you want to, I don't use Carrot

1078
01:10:56,485 --> 01:11:00,405
Speaker 1:  personally, but you, I would assume as a giant weather nerd love it very

1079
01:11:00,405 --> 01:11:00,565
Speaker 1:  much.

1080
01:11:01,035 --> 01:11:04,965
Speaker 9:  Yeah, I mean I think a lot of people use Carrot weather because it was the

1081
01:11:04,965 --> 01:11:08,725
Speaker 9:  first out of the gate with Apple Watch support. Hmm. But I've stuck with

1082
01:11:08,725 --> 01:11:12,245
Speaker 9:  it because they add so many niche nerdy features

1083
01:11:12,595 --> 01:11:16,405
Speaker 9:  like being able to pick your sources but also just like

1084
01:11:16,625 --> 01:11:20,565
Speaker 9:  You can completely customize the layout for what you want. Things that

1085
01:11:20,665 --> 01:11:24,365
Speaker 9:  I'm constantly wanting to see are the humidity

1086
01:11:24,495 --> 01:11:27,885
Speaker 9:  percentage and also just like the UV index because

1087
01:11:28,385 --> 01:11:32,045
Speaker 9:  it, it wildly swings in New York City and so

1088
01:11:32,435 --> 01:11:35,445
Speaker 9:  it's kind of good to know when you should probably put some sunscreen on

1089
01:11:35,565 --> 01:11:37,725
Speaker 9:  'cause you're gonna get burn to a crisp when you go outside.

1090
01:11:37,875 --> 01:11:41,445
Speaker 1:  Totally. And that's actually another good customization point that not only

1091
01:11:41,505 --> 01:11:45,285
Speaker 1:  is the data source really important, but knowing which parts of the forecast

1092
01:11:45,285 --> 01:11:48,965
Speaker 1:  you care about. Like I remember when I was in California during all the wildfires,

1093
01:11:49,425 --> 01:11:53,405
Speaker 1:  the air quality index became very important. Yeah. And so that was then like

1094
01:11:53,445 --> 01:11:56,325
Speaker 1:  a thing that I paid a lot of attention to in the forecast. And having something

1095
01:11:56,325 --> 01:11:59,405
Speaker 1:  where You can surface that into either like the home screen of your app or

1096
01:11:59,405 --> 01:12:03,125
Speaker 1:  even like a widget on your home screen goes a really long way because glance

1097
01:12:03,125 --> 01:12:06,445
Speaker 1:  ability is the whole thing, right? Like you should not have to spend 45 seconds

1098
01:12:06,505 --> 01:12:09,325
Speaker 1:  in your weather app to get a sense of what do I need to know before I go

1099
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:12,125
Speaker 1:  outside. Exactly. So I that's, that's a very good one and Carrot does do

1100
01:12:12,125 --> 01:12:14,885
Speaker 1:  that very well. Carrot we should say also just got a big update that people

1101
01:12:14,885 --> 01:12:17,845
Speaker 1:  are very excited about. I, I honestly think that's a pretty good place to

1102
01:12:17,845 --> 01:12:19,525
Speaker 1:  start. It's a, it's a really good weather app.

1103
01:12:19,795 --> 01:12:23,565
Speaker 9:  Yeah, it's a great weather app. They just released a new update that again

1104
01:12:23,565 --> 01:12:27,525
Speaker 9:  allows war customization of the, of that like main screen.

1105
01:12:27,585 --> 01:12:30,725
Speaker 9:  You see when, when it comes out, I think there's a few other odds and ends

1106
01:12:30,725 --> 01:12:34,165
Speaker 9:  goodies that were in there. My backup weather app is

1107
01:12:34,435 --> 01:12:38,405
Speaker 9:  just about the nerdiest one. You can get it, it is called ambient

1108
01:12:38,405 --> 01:12:42,245
Speaker 9:  weather and it connects over the internet to that weather

1109
01:12:42,245 --> 01:12:45,925
Speaker 9:  station you were asking me about earlier. So I have a weather station on

1110
01:12:45,925 --> 01:12:49,885
Speaker 9:  my roof that reads all the weather information that you could possibly want.

1111
01:12:50,115 --> 01:12:53,765
Speaker 9:  This app allows me to access that weather station from anywhere. So

1112
01:12:53,965 --> 01:12:57,325
Speaker 9:  regardless of where I am, I can pull up the same information that's on the

1113
01:12:57,515 --> 01:13:01,405
Speaker 9:  cute little LCD screen that's on my desk. So that's my backup weather app.

1114
01:13:01,425 --> 01:13:01,845
Speaker 9:  That's

1115
01:13:01,845 --> 01:13:05,325
Speaker 1:  Pretty good. I did a big tour of weather apps

1116
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:08,765
Speaker 1:  maybe a year ago. There are a lot of good ones out there, honestly, like

1117
01:13:08,845 --> 01:13:12,045
Speaker 1:  e especially if, if you're somebody who really likes to see like weather

1118
01:13:12,235 --> 01:13:16,165
Speaker 1:  news and you wanna keep up on sort of weather more broadly, the Weather Channel

1119
01:13:16,265 --> 01:13:19,005
Speaker 1:  app has actually gotten a lot better over time and is actually pretty good

1120
01:13:19,025 --> 01:13:23,005
Speaker 1:  now. They did a big redesign I think earlier this year. It's still kind

1121
01:13:23,085 --> 01:13:25,765
Speaker 1:  of too much for my taste, but it's a very good app. But what I landed on

1122
01:13:25,765 --> 01:13:29,685
Speaker 1:  is an app called Hello Weather, which I would say is a lot like Carrot but

1123
01:13:29,685 --> 01:13:33,525
Speaker 1:  just kind of less, it's very designy. They have a bunch of really beautiful

1124
01:13:33,525 --> 01:13:37,485
Speaker 1:  widgets. But my thing is it has this incredibly good kind of

1125
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:41,245
Speaker 1:  glanceable hour by hour forecast, which I discovered is the only thing I

1126
01:13:41,475 --> 01:13:44,445
Speaker 1:  ever actually care about is just like, I wake up in the morning and I'm like,

1127
01:13:44,445 --> 01:13:47,805
Speaker 1:  when is it going to be hot? When is it going to rain the end? Like especially

1128
01:13:47,865 --> 01:13:50,765
Speaker 1:  for where we are, those are the only two questions that ever really matter.

1129
01:13:51,185 --> 01:13:55,085
Speaker 1:  And hello Weather, like Carrot lets you pick from a bunch of different sources.

1130
01:13:55,465 --> 01:13:58,845
Speaker 1:  So I did the Forecast Advisor thing. I went through, I picked the most accurate

1131
01:13:58,845 --> 01:14:02,805
Speaker 1:  source for me. And at that point it's just about kind of aesthetics,

1132
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:05,725
Speaker 1:  right? Like all the data is the same and I, there's just something about

1133
01:14:05,725 --> 01:14:09,565
Speaker 1:  the sort of cleanliness of Hello Weather that I have come to really

1134
01:14:09,565 --> 01:14:09,765
Speaker 1:  like.

1135
01:14:10,265 --> 01:14:14,195
Speaker 9:  So the, the biggest question I have about this app, the hour by hour

1136
01:14:14,425 --> 01:14:18,355
Speaker 9:  weather data, is it the feels like temperature or is it

1137
01:14:18,615 --> 01:14:19,835
Speaker 9:  the actual temperature?

1138
01:14:20,225 --> 01:14:23,555
Speaker 1:  Liam, that's such a good question. It's such a good question and I'm so glad

1139
01:14:23,555 --> 01:14:27,435
Speaker 1:  you asked it. Is the actual temperature, which is the wrong answer, it

1140
01:14:27,435 --> 01:14:30,715
Speaker 1:  should be that feels like temperature. Yeah, but what it gives you at the

1141
01:14:30,715 --> 01:14:33,155
Speaker 1:  top is it'll show you the actual temperature in big letters and then right

1142
01:14:33,155 --> 01:14:35,915
Speaker 1:  underneath it that feels like temperature. So right now as we're recording

1143
01:14:35,915 --> 01:14:39,235
Speaker 1:  this, oh okay, it's 87 degrees. It feels like a hundred Cool

1144
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:43,555
Speaker 1:  love summer 2024, but it doesn't give you that hour by hour. And

1145
01:14:43,555 --> 01:14:46,875
Speaker 1:  I would argue that it should, but yeah, what I like that it gives you is

1146
01:14:47,795 --> 01:14:51,715
Speaker 1:  a, a sort of running change in what matters. So

1147
01:14:51,715 --> 01:14:55,115
Speaker 1:  when it's not gonna rain, it'll show you the UV index in the, in the bar

1148
01:14:55,275 --> 01:14:57,715
Speaker 1:  graph, but when it's gonna rain it'll show you the precipitation amounts

1149
01:14:57,715 --> 01:15:00,995
Speaker 1:  per hour. Smart. So the hour by hour forecast actually shifts based on what

1150
01:15:00,995 --> 01:15:04,435
Speaker 1:  is most likely to happen. So on a sunny day like today, the, it tells me

1151
01:15:04,435 --> 01:15:07,635
Speaker 1:  the UV index. So they've just done a bunch of very clever things and again,

1152
01:15:07,635 --> 01:15:11,115
Speaker 1:  all of this is dependent on the data source to be accurate.

1153
01:15:11,455 --> 01:15:14,235
Speaker 1:  But I've gone in and figured out which data source is most accurate. And

1154
01:15:14,235 --> 01:15:17,755
Speaker 1:  so now I have this thing, the one thing I hate about Hello Weather is that

1155
01:15:17,755 --> 01:15:21,675
Speaker 1:  each data source spews different texts. So in they,

1156
01:15:21,675 --> 01:15:25,035
Speaker 1:  they all have this like structured data that just flows into the app, but

1157
01:15:25,035 --> 01:15:28,875
Speaker 1:  then they all will also have a description of the forecast and

1158
01:15:29,175 --> 01:15:33,075
Speaker 1:  the data source that I picked is AccuWeather, which at least the last time

1159
01:15:33,075 --> 01:15:36,915
Speaker 1:  I checked was most accurate for what I am pumps out these really long sort

1160
01:15:36,915 --> 01:15:40,835
Speaker 1:  of unhelpful stupid things like this one just says partly sunny and hot

1161
01:15:40,945 --> 01:15:43,915
Speaker 1:  semicolon a thunderstorm in spots late this afternoon, semicolon

1162
01:16:23,635 --> 01:16:23,915
Speaker 9:  find

1163
01:16:52,865 --> 01:16:53,755
Speaker 9:  Yeah, totally agree.

1164
01:16:54,045 --> 01:16:58,035
Speaker 1:  Sweet. All right Liam, thank you as always. Of course. Go

1165
01:16:58,035 --> 01:16:58,795
Speaker 1:  back to your weather station.

1166
01:16:59,595 --> 01:16:59,915
Speaker 9:  I will.

1167
01:17:00,865 --> 01:17:03,515
Speaker 1:  Alright, that is it for The Vergecast today. Thank you to

1168
01:17:43,085 --> 01:17:43,285
Speaker 1:  and
