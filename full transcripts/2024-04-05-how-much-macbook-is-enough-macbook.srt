00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:11,165
Speaker 5:  Which is better though. Like the way they name phones

15
00:01:11,585 --> 00:01:15,325
Speaker 5:  at Samsung or the way they name products on

16
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,245
Speaker 5:  Amazon's website.

17
00:01:16,475 --> 00:01:19,965

18
00:01:20,785 --> 00:01:24,405
Speaker 3:  the Samsung naming conventions. And in fact, most tech product naming conventions

19
00:01:24,705 --> 00:01:28,485
Speaker 3:  are now like performance art. Yeah. They're just like, some words, a

00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:32,085
Speaker 3:  galaxy, a number, some other letters. Yeah. Fine.

21
00:01:32,155 --> 00:01:32,645

22
00:01:32,645 --> 00:01:33,805

25
00:01:41,465 --> 00:01:45,165
Speaker 3:  AI and all these algorithms, and we're like, what's the best way to win it?

26
00:01:45,165 --> 00:01:47,765
Speaker 3:  Then just shove all the words in the title field

27
00:01:48,305 --> 00:01:50,965
Speaker 4:  And then off to the side there's like Sony who's just like, would you like

28
00:01:50,965 --> 00:01:54,445
Speaker 4:  16 numbers and letters together? That don't mean that don't mean anything.

42
00:02:32,405 --> 00:02:33,605
Speaker 3:  schedule like a 5-year-old schedule.

00:02:42,645 --> 00:02:46,605
Speaker 3:  live my life. Yeah. Like on this. And then I immediately was like, no.

Speaker 3:  I,

48
00:02:46,805 --> 00:02:50,525
Speaker 4:  Especially when you're on vacation though, like being the first one up has

49
00:02:50,835 --> 00:02:53,965
Speaker 4:  real ramifications. Yeah. You're like, the world is your oyster for like

67
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:39,085
Speaker 3:  do it. You should

68
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:39,725
Speaker 5:  Do it. It's very

69
00:03:39,725 --> 00:03:42,125
Speaker 4:  Good. It's good. It's good. It is legitimately very good. It's very

70
00:03:42,175 --> 00:03:42,525
Speaker 5:  Funny.

71
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:46,005
Speaker 4:  It's like, it's, it's straight out of the brain of Tina Fey. So like If,

72
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:49,165
Speaker 4:  you think 30 Rock is funny? You'll think Girls five. Eva is funny and I think

73
00:03:49,165 --> 00:03:50,525
Speaker 4:  30 Rock is very funny and

74
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:53,965
Speaker 5:  It spends a lot of time making fun of like a very specific

75
00:03:53,965 --> 00:03:57,245
Speaker 5:  neighborhood in Brooklyn that I used to live in. So I'm like, nice.

78
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,245
Speaker 3:  you know, I was like, I opened Netflix. I was like, I'm gonna watch this

80
00:04:10,275 --> 00:04:14,125
Speaker 3:  this is, I had the Netflix problem again. I need to disclose that I made

81
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,605
Speaker 3:  a Netflix show. Our Netflix show is great,

82
00:04:17,065 --> 00:04:17,805
Speaker 5:  Unlike some

83
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:18,445
Speaker 4:  Other ones, other Netflix shows.

84
00:04:18,515 --> 00:04:22,165
Speaker 3:  It's called The, future of Less So, but I don Dunno.

85
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,885
Speaker 3:  It was like, that was the thing I did. 'cause we went on vacation, we came

00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:33,645
Speaker 3:  watching, watching television. Yeah,

89
00:04:33,705 --> 00:04:33,925
Speaker 5:  Of

00:04:37,675 --> 00:04:38,245
Speaker 3:  it's fine

92
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:43,245
Speaker 5:  That that's why I, I switched it off and turned on the New Walking Dead show.

93
00:04:43,345 --> 00:04:46,685
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah. And I like, that's just adorable. It's two people being like, what

146
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:11,645
Speaker 3:  start there. We did have a big review this week. Yep. A few weeks after it

147
00:07:11,645 --> 00:07:14,685
Speaker 3:  came out. We hired a new laptop reviewer, Joan and Elias.

148
00:07:15,425 --> 00:07:19,365
Speaker 3:  Her, she, we got her up to Speed crayons. We like let her do a think pad

149
00:07:19,465 --> 00:07:21,525
Speaker 3:  and then we're like, MacBook Air get it done. Yeah.

150
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:25,125
Speaker 5:  And, and she did, she she had a lot of feelings about the

151
00:07:25,835 --> 00:07:29,685
Speaker 5:  MacBook Air M three 15 and 13 inch

152
00:07:30,005 --> 00:07:33,365
Speaker 5:  because they both came out and they're pretty similar. And she was like,

153
00:07:33,435 --> 00:07:36,965
Speaker 5:  they're good MacBooks. They, they got a little faster and then she was very

154
00:07:36,975 --> 00:07:40,845
Speaker 5:  upset because they had eight gigabytes of Ram standard. And, and I,

155
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:43,805
Speaker 5:  I tend to agree with her, but I know some people on this podcast don't.

156
00:07:44,315 --> 00:07:47,605
Speaker 4:  Well, yes. I mean, we're gonna fight about that for many hours. Some people

157
00:07:47,605 --> 00:07:47,885
Speaker 4:  have

158
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,045
Speaker 5:  Bad takes but say it's okay.

159
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:53,005
Speaker 4:  It, it brought me such great joy to watch someone

160
00:07:53,035 --> 00:07:56,645
Speaker 4:  else come and go through the same thing that all of us have been through

161
00:07:56,645 --> 00:08:00,325
Speaker 4:  with the MacBooks over the years, which is, this is very good. It's probably

162
00:08:00,325 --> 00:08:04,285
Speaker 4:  the best laptop you can buy. It is a teeny tiny bit

163
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:07,285
Speaker 4:  better than the last one and slightly more expensive in Apple. Really wants

164
00:08:07,285 --> 00:08:11,045
Speaker 4:  you to buy something much more expensive. Do I give that an eight or a nine?

165
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:15,205
Speaker 4:  It's like the eternal question of the Macbook Air is like, it's

166
00:08:15,365 --> 00:08:18,605
Speaker 4:  probably the best laptop. It could probably, it's kind of annoying.

167
00:08:19,475 --> 00:08:22,245
Speaker 4:  What do I do with that? Yeah. And it's just like, it's nice to see someone

168
00:08:22,245 --> 00:08:25,885
Speaker 4:  else go through this very intense process because the story of the MacBook

169
00:08:25,885 --> 00:08:29,845
Speaker 4:  era is like, it, it rules like it is, it is pretty hands

170
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:33,645
Speaker 4:  down the best all around laptop on the planet and yet

171
00:08:34,155 --> 00:08:36,765
Speaker 4:  it's a pretty small upgrade over the last one. It has a bunch of the same

172
00:08:37,085 --> 00:08:40,605
Speaker 4:  deficiencies as the last one. And they desperately, desperately, desperately

173
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:44,525
Speaker 4:  want you to spend $2,500 on a laptop and not a thousand dollars on a laptop.

174
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,765
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Are very good at getting you from one to the other.

175
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:47,645
Speaker 5:  That's what I did.

176
00:08:48,265 --> 00:08:48,925
Speaker 4:  Is it? Yeah.

177
00:08:49,115 --> 00:08:50,405
Speaker 5:  Well I went with a back book pro.

178
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,965
Speaker 4:  Yeah, you got you. Just, you you let yourself get specked up.

179
00:08:53,205 --> 00:08:57,085
Speaker 5:  I got specked up. I like, like the, that that feeling from, from the early

180
00:08:57,115 --> 00:09:00,885
Speaker 5:  days of the MacBook air where you, you couldn't get the air, you had to get

181
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:04,125
Speaker 5:  a pro If, you wanted power. I was like, I know, I don't, I don't, I know

182
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:07,085
Speaker 5:  I could be fine with an air, but I have an air for work. This is really like,

183
00:09:07,155 --> 00:09:08,885
Speaker 5:  it's important for me to know the whole lineup

184
00:09:08,985 --> 00:09:12,445
Speaker 4:  So I can either have a pro to run all my Chrome tabs or I can have an air

185
00:09:12,465 --> 00:09:14,165
Speaker 4:  to run all of my Chrome tabs. Is that

186
00:09:14,165 --> 00:09:17,165
Speaker 5:  What you're going through? Yeah. Well and Crusader Kings three

187
00:09:17,995 --> 00:09:20,325
Speaker 5:  like, it it fair, it plays it beautifully.

188
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:24,285
Speaker 3:  So what you're talking about is directly related to the eight gigs of RAM

189
00:09:24,685 --> 00:09:27,725
Speaker 3:  situation. Yeah. Yeah. Which is you settle down to buy this laptop. The base

190
00:09:27,965 --> 00:09:31,885
Speaker 3:  configuration should be amazing. The base configuration compared to any other

191
00:09:31,885 --> 00:09:32,685
Speaker 3:  base configuration

192
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:37,365
Speaker 3:  potentially the best all on laptop. Like that's a, it's a real thing. You

193
00:09:37,365 --> 00:09:40,085
Speaker 3:  can make an argument for sure. Yep. And then you're like, but if I put eight

194
00:09:40,085 --> 00:09:43,645
Speaker 3:  gigs of RAM in this, it will last for two years and then it will die and

195
00:09:43,645 --> 00:09:47,285
Speaker 3:  I'll do this again. So I should put 16 or 32 gigs of RAM into it. And then

196
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:49,525
Speaker 3:  you're like, I should add some storage to it because if now it's gonna last

197
00:09:49,525 --> 00:09:53,125
Speaker 3:  a long time and then you are quickly at, oh, I should just buy Macbook Pro.

198
00:09:53,305 --> 00:09:57,205
Speaker 3:  Yep. Yeah. I just spend slightly even more money than I

199
00:09:57,205 --> 00:09:58,525
Speaker 3:  can just have a 14 inch Macbook pro

200
00:09:58,595 --> 00:09:58,885
Speaker 4:  Like

201
00:09:59,085 --> 00:10:02,525
Speaker 5:  O off off the shelf. You don't have to worry about somebody like customizing

202
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:05,765
Speaker 5:  it and them adding a little shipping time to it. Just get

203
00:10:05,765 --> 00:10:07,045
Speaker 4:  Happy. Yeah. Because what it is it, you go from

204
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:12,565
Speaker 4:  eight to 16 gigs of ram, that's 200 bucks. You go from

205
00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:16,565
Speaker 4:  the base storage, which is 2 56 to five 12, that's

206
00:10:16,565 --> 00:10:20,045
Speaker 4:  another 200 bucks. So already you've just turned your a thousand dollars

207
00:10:20,045 --> 00:10:23,965
Speaker 4:  or your $1,100 laptop in this case into a $1,500 laptop. At which

208
00:10:23,965 --> 00:10:27,405
Speaker 4:  point you're like, well maybe I'll just get the 15 inch 'cause it's not that

209
00:10:27,405 --> 00:10:30,205
Speaker 4:  much more expensive. Yeah. And then you get, then you're up to there and

210
00:10:30,205 --> 00:10:34,165
Speaker 4:  then it is, I mean it is so perfectly calculated how to get you

211
00:10:34,165 --> 00:10:37,925
Speaker 4:  to buy like the mid spec MacBook Pro. Yeah. It's just unbelievable.

212
00:10:37,955 --> 00:10:41,765
Speaker 4:  It's beautiful. Yeah. And it is not the computer anyone needs. Like

213
00:10:41,845 --> 00:10:45,285
Speaker 4:  I truly do not believe the premise that If, you buy eight gigs of ram, it's

214
00:10:45,285 --> 00:10:49,165
Speaker 4:  only gonna last you two years and it won't work. I think like if you're a

215
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:52,725
Speaker 4:  person who like really heavily uses your computer

216
00:10:53,075 --> 00:10:56,765
Speaker 4:  Sure. I think if you're gonna spend money on one additional spec, ram is

217
00:10:56,765 --> 00:11:00,445
Speaker 4:  always the thing. So this is totally believe that. I believe firmly that

218
00:11:00,505 --> 00:11:03,805
Speaker 4:  for most people, for most uses the base

219
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:07,165
Speaker 4:  configuration of the MacBook air storage ram, everything is fine.

220
00:11:07,215 --> 00:11:08,405
Speaker 3:  Crazy. You're a crazy person.

221
00:11:08,515 --> 00:11:09,525
Speaker 4:  It's so much computer.

222
00:11:09,755 --> 00:11:10,045
Speaker 5:  This

223
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,445
Speaker 3:  Is what I'm trying to But not enough Ram. Go ahead. Yeah. This

224
00:11:12,445 --> 00:11:15,525
Speaker 5:  Is what I'm trying to understand is 'cause like you said this and it was

225
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:19,365
Speaker 5:  like just lobbing a bomb into chat. Mm. In the office. Like, like you My

226
00:11:19,365 --> 00:11:19,445
Speaker 5:  God.

227
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,685
Speaker 4:  Yeah. You get so mad at me. Yeah, I

228
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:24,365
Speaker 5:  I resisted like telling anybody that you said that and then,

229
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,205
Speaker 5:  then you like you were like, yeah, I believe eight gigs and everybody's like,

230
00:11:27,205 --> 00:11:31,165
Speaker 5:  David, what are you doing? And is it because we're

231
00:11:31,165 --> 00:11:34,765
Speaker 5:  all people who use our laptops a lot and always have a

232
00:11:34,765 --> 00:11:38,645
Speaker 5:  bajillion tabs open that that we feel that need for the ram.

233
00:11:39,605 --> 00:11:40,485
Speaker 4:  I mean that's part of it.

234
00:11:40,555 --> 00:11:42,605
Speaker 5:  Like is it, is it like a Verge?

235
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:46,405
Speaker 4:  It's, I think it's two things. I think half of it is what you just described.

236
00:11:46,445 --> 00:11:50,165
Speaker 4:  I think the other half is we are all literally professionally trained to

237
00:11:50,165 --> 00:11:53,965
Speaker 4:  be sensitive to our computers being slow. And then I look at like my

238
00:11:53,965 --> 00:11:57,485
Speaker 4:  mom who is on a 9-year-old

239
00:11:57,755 --> 00:12:01,605
Speaker 4:  iPad and like doesn't notice that it's a problem. Like it just,

240
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,805
Speaker 4:  it just works fine. She taps a thing, she waits a couple of seconds and it

241
00:12:04,805 --> 00:12:07,565
Speaker 4:  opens and I'm like, do you know how long Safari just took to open mom? And

242
00:12:07,565 --> 00:12:10,765
Speaker 4:  she's like, what are you talking? It just open like it's whatever. I think

243
00:12:11,515 --> 00:12:15,485
Speaker 4:  most people don't spend as much time thinking about how long their tabs

244
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:19,245
Speaker 4:  take to open as we do. And maybe they should and I think they arguably should.

245
00:12:19,465 --> 00:12:19,685
Speaker 4:  And

246
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:23,805
Speaker 3:  For $1,100, I'm just gonna throw back your vision pro

247
00:12:23,805 --> 00:12:27,765
Speaker 3:  criticism for $1,100 being like this computer is

248
00:12:27,765 --> 00:12:29,845
Speaker 3:  a little slow when it's the fastest computer,

249
00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:32,205
Speaker 4:  But it's not slow. It's not

250
00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:35,245
Speaker 3:  Slow. That swap is immediately noticeable. So the argument, the pro

251
00:12:35,445 --> 00:12:35,805
Speaker 4:  I agree.

252
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:39,725
Speaker 3:  Eight gig argument. I agree. That is that the SSD is so fast that

253
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:43,245
Speaker 3:  swapping to and from virtual memory using the state of the art, blah, blah,

254
00:12:43,245 --> 00:12:44,565
Speaker 3:  blah, that apple is state of the, all right,

255
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:44,765
Speaker 5:  Apple

256
00:12:45,905 --> 00:12:48,085
Speaker 3:  Is imperceptible. This is the argument. This is the

257
00:12:48,245 --> 00:12:50,965
Speaker 4:  Argument. And on the new one, apparently the storage is much faster. So that

258
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,245
Speaker 4:  argument might be closer to true.

259
00:12:52,635 --> 00:12:54,205
Speaker 3:  Yeah. The argument is wrong.

260
00:12:55,995 --> 00:12:59,765
Speaker 3:  Like the storage is still slower than the ram. It might be very fast, but

261
00:12:59,765 --> 00:13:02,405
Speaker 3:  it's still slower than the ram. And so when you hit the swap, which you can

262
00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:04,565
Speaker 3:  do really easily and I'm macare, they gave Ram

263
00:13:04,665 --> 00:13:06,165
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna bet I'm swapped right now. Let's see.

264
00:13:06,915 --> 00:13:08,605
Speaker 3:  What do you, what do you, what do you do to,

265
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,765
Speaker 5:  He's going into the activity monitor. Oh yeah,

266
00:13:10,765 --> 00:13:14,205
Speaker 3:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I didn't know If. you had some like weird utility. David

267
00:13:14,225 --> 00:13:17,605
Speaker 3:  is the proprietor of installer. I hit the swap often has weird utilities.

268
00:13:17,725 --> 00:13:17,965
Speaker 3:  I do have

269
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,845
Speaker 4:  Weird utilities, but I have hit the swap. Yeah. How do,

270
00:13:19,845 --> 00:13:20,685
Speaker 3:  How do you usually it just happens. Hit

271
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:25,445
Speaker 4:  If. you go to memory, it'll tell you down at the bottom. Oh, swap used.

272
00:13:26,215 --> 00:13:27,325
Speaker 4:  Sorry, keep going. Sorry.

273
00:13:27,395 --> 00:13:31,245
Speaker 3:  Some riveting radio program, open activity monitor

274
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:32,205
Speaker 3:  and click on memory.

275
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:34,245
Speaker 5:  It's a how to.

276
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:38,445
Speaker 3:  Yeah. All I'm saying is that's the argument. And I, at

277
00:13:38,445 --> 00:13:39,565
Speaker 3:  this point in 2024,

278
00:13:41,185 --> 00:13:45,165
Speaker 3:  not a good argument. They should just bump you up to 16 gigs of RAM

279
00:13:45,165 --> 00:13:47,965
Speaker 3:  at standard. And then I think this computer would be amazing.

280
00:13:48,645 --> 00:13:51,925
Speaker 4:  I I do agree with that. I think, I think it would be better if everybody

281
00:13:51,945 --> 00:13:55,765
Speaker 4:  had 16 gigs of ram. I think it's absurd that Apple charges $200

282
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:59,445
Speaker 4:  to go from eight to 16 when that RAM doesn't cost anywhere near

283
00:13:59,745 --> 00:14:00,445
Speaker 4:  $200.

284
00:14:00,745 --> 00:14:02,325
Speaker 5:  The most enduring scam

285
00:14:02,655 --> 00:14:03,605
Speaker 4:  Apple. Oh yeah. I mean the

286
00:14:03,605 --> 00:14:06,125
Speaker 3:  Margins and it's, and it soldered in so you can't even upgrade it later.

287
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:06,645
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Right.

288
00:14:06,755 --> 00:14:09,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Because used to the, the heck was you'd buy it with the garbage ramp

289
00:14:10,065 --> 00:14:12,125
Speaker 5:  and then you just upgrade it as soon as you got

290
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,765
Speaker 3:  It. Yeah. You do the thing where you lift it up the keyboard.

291
00:14:13,795 --> 00:14:17,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And just, and you're done. And now they're like, no, you'll pay us

292
00:14:17,245 --> 00:14:20,445
Speaker 5:  $200 or swap and suffer.

293
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:24,485
Speaker 3:  Anyhow, all I'm saying is great computer. It, it's like the base

294
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:28,405
Speaker 3:  storage of the iPhone or the base storage of iCloud. I was like, how much

295
00:14:28,465 --> 00:14:30,405
Speaker 3:  is just enough to annoy you into paying us more.

296
00:14:30,905 --> 00:14:34,805
Speaker 4:  Oh no, that's real. But how much, when was it that

297
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:36,205
Speaker 4:  you switched your family to Chromebooks?

298
00:14:37,355 --> 00:14:37,805
Speaker 3:  Ages ago.

299
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:38,725
Speaker 4:  How is that going?

300
00:14:39,515 --> 00:14:42,125
Speaker 3:  Fine. Because I, 'cause I bought, well I

301
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:45,005
Speaker 4:  Bought You got a lot of 16 gig of RAM Chromebooks running out there.

302
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:49,005
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I bought, so it's only one Chromebook. Okay. It was the Google, what

303
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:51,885
Speaker 3:  was the fanciest one? The thousand pixel dollars? The, no, it was before

304
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:52,285
Speaker 3:  the,

305
00:14:52,635 --> 00:14:55,645
Speaker 4:  Well there was the Chromebook pixel. That was the the sick one.

306
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:59,045
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I'm literally Googling bought my mom a Chromebook because I might be

307
00:14:59,045 --> 00:15:03,005
Speaker 3:  the only, hold on, hold on. Lemme just get that right. No, I bought

308
00:15:03,005 --> 00:15:06,885
Speaker 3:  our Chromebook pixel in 2016. Okay. It was,

309
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:10,685
Speaker 3:  it was a thousand dollars. It has a core I

310
00:15:10,685 --> 00:15:14,445
Speaker 3:  seven and like 16 gigs of ram and it is just, do you really

311
00:15:14,555 --> 00:15:18,285
Speaker 3:  rocking Wow. Because it was so overpowered. Yeah. For its time.

312
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:22,525
Speaker 3:  Now it's a little underpowered to run Chrome. My 2015 IMAX

313
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,205
Speaker 3:  is such

314
00:15:23,325 --> 00:15:24,645
Speaker 4:  A damning critique of Chrome.

315
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,045
Speaker 3:  It's not great that an I

316
00:15:26,045 --> 00:15:29,285
Speaker 4:  Seven and 16 gigs of ram like barely keep up anymore.

317
00:15:29,865 --> 00:15:33,485
Speaker 3:  My 2015 iMac, which is done now. Oh it's over.

318
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:37,165
Speaker 3:  Whoa. Wow. It's like the fans are just like on all the time. But it lasted

319
00:15:37,165 --> 00:15:39,245
Speaker 3:  as long as it did almost 10 years. 32 gigs of ram.

320
00:15:40,745 --> 00:15:44,565
Speaker 3:  That's if I have one piece of advice for buying a Mac, which is loaded

321
00:15:44,565 --> 00:15:47,605
Speaker 3:  up, especially 'cause it's soldered in loaded up with RAM at the beginning

322
00:15:48,275 --> 00:15:51,445
Speaker 3:  because you can't fix it. You can't upgrade it. Everything else

323
00:15:51,945 --> 00:15:54,365
Speaker 3:  you'll be fine. Like over time.

324
00:15:54,725 --> 00:15:58,645
Speaker 4:  I do agree with that. I also think 256 gigs of storage, unless you do a lot

325
00:15:58,645 --> 00:16:02,525
Speaker 4:  of media, like if you're If, you just take photos on your phone and

326
00:16:02,525 --> 00:16:06,445
Speaker 4:  upload them to Google Photos and that's your photo strategy. 256 gigs is

327
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:06,805
Speaker 4:  plenty.

328
00:16:07,185 --> 00:16:08,485
Speaker 5:  Oh, I, I disagree there. I

329
00:16:08,485 --> 00:16:08,885
Speaker 4:  Know you do.

330
00:16:09,075 --> 00:16:12,925
Speaker 5:  Well and then I'm saying this as someone who has a server at home to

331
00:16:12,925 --> 00:16:14,445
Speaker 5:  offload all my big files.

332
00:16:14,445 --> 00:16:18,045
Speaker 4:  Right. Like a super normal workflow for regular people that everybody does

333
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:18,605
Speaker 4:  at. But

334
00:16:18,605 --> 00:16:22,205
Speaker 5:  Even with that, I'm hitting that 2 56. Like the, the laptop I bought now

335
00:16:22,385 --> 00:16:26,205
Speaker 5:  has five 12. 'cause I was tired of hitting the 2 56 and being like, oh, I

336
00:16:26,205 --> 00:16:29,525
Speaker 5:  have to go delete this game that I play two times a year, but I really wanna

337
00:16:29,525 --> 00:16:29,845
Speaker 5:  have access

338
00:16:29,845 --> 00:16:30,965
Speaker 4:  To it. What's using up all your storage?

339
00:16:31,105 --> 00:16:31,765
Speaker 5:  It it's games.

340
00:16:32,195 --> 00:16:35,525
Speaker 4:  Okay. I mean fair then I, I'll add that to media. That's totally fair. Games

341
00:16:35,545 --> 00:16:38,885
Speaker 4:  are enormous. They're so you download two games now and you've eaten 2 56.

342
00:16:39,185 --> 00:16:43,125
Speaker 4:  But absent those two things, there's very

343
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,485
Speaker 4:  little you're gonna do that's going to take up that much storage.

344
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,605
Speaker 5:  That's true. My mom has like a hundred

345
00:16:48,195 --> 00:16:49,045
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Billion

346
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:49,885
Speaker 5:  Gigabytes.

347
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:53,685
Speaker 4:  It's fine. Yeah. And 256 literally, unless you do media, which

348
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:57,205
Speaker 4:  is huge. And especially now like good God, every photo off the iPhone is

349
00:16:57,445 --> 00:17:01,165
Speaker 4:  enormous now. So like get as much as you can if that's a thing that you care

350
00:17:01,165 --> 00:17:03,325
Speaker 4:  about and you're gonna like be in Lightroom doing stuff, which is another

351
00:17:03,325 --> 00:17:07,045
Speaker 4:  case to get more ram. But if you're just, I firmly

352
00:17:07,045 --> 00:17:10,045
Speaker 4:  believe that most people buy laptops download a web browser and that the

353
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:13,885
Speaker 4:  end, that is, that is 98% of most people's laptop

354
00:17:13,885 --> 00:17:17,765
Speaker 4:  experience now and like maybe office. And for that the

355
00:17:17,835 --> 00:17:20,845
Speaker 4:  base config is fine. I so firmly believe that.

356
00:17:21,365 --> 00:17:24,525
Speaker 3:  I think you should spend at least 14.99 on the one of 16 gigs of Ram and

357
00:17:24,525 --> 00:17:25,485
Speaker 3:  512 gigs of

358
00:17:25,485 --> 00:17:29,005
Speaker 4:  Storage. And then at that point, why not get the 15 inch? Yeah. Because

359
00:17:29,195 --> 00:17:30,565
Speaker 4:  then there's a, there's a pro

360
00:17:30,565 --> 00:17:33,045
Speaker 5:  I'll sell you and then Yeah. And then you're just at a 14 pro and you're

361
00:17:33,045 --> 00:17:34,165
Speaker 5:  like, you have the 14 pro. Why? Actually

362
00:17:34,245 --> 00:17:37,925
Speaker 3:  I thought the biggest takeaway from Joanna's review is that the M two is

363
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:41,325
Speaker 3:  still for sale. Yeah. And that's a pretty good deal. If, you can spec it

364
00:17:41,325 --> 00:17:41,725
Speaker 3:  up. Which

365
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:44,765
Speaker 4:  Is funny 'cause this was also in a lot of ways the story of the M two review

366
00:17:44,985 --> 00:17:48,765
Speaker 4:  was that the M1 is still for sale. Yeah. And now, I mean you can buy

367
00:17:49,305 --> 00:17:52,765
Speaker 4:  the M1 at Walmart for, what is it, like 699 bucks?

368
00:17:52,985 --> 00:17:55,565
Speaker 3:  Did we ever, so this hit while I was on vacation. Yeah. And there was like

369
00:17:55,605 --> 00:17:59,445
Speaker 3:  a furious amount of like conversation about whether Walmart was blowing out

370
00:17:59,505 --> 00:18:03,405
Speaker 3:  old stock or whether Apple was gonna make more M ones and if

371
00:18:03,405 --> 00:18:05,125
Speaker 3:  they, they're gonna make more M ones. Yes.

372
00:18:05,755 --> 00:18:08,365
Speaker 4:  That seems seems to be. I don't know that we've ever actually had that officially

373
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:11,445
Speaker 4:  confirmed, but that that is Yeah. It's, it's every bit of evidence we have

374
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:12,485
Speaker 4:  suggests that that is the case.

375
00:18:12,715 --> 00:18:16,045
Speaker 5:  Unclear. It seems like it's gonna be going for a while. And it's not necessarily

376
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:20,365
Speaker 5:  like they're making more M ones, they just have a

377
00:18:20,605 --> 00:18:21,605
Speaker 5:  ton of stock.

378
00:18:21,785 --> 00:18:25,685
Speaker 4:  No, they don't. That's not how Apple works. Literally. Apple pioneered the

379
00:18:25,685 --> 00:18:27,445
Speaker 4:  idea of not having warehouses. No,

380
00:18:27,445 --> 00:18:31,165
Speaker 5:  No. I mean they have, they have like, they have tons of extra stuff around.

381
00:18:31,185 --> 00:18:35,005
Speaker 5:  That's how we got the iPhone se The iPhone SE came because they had a

382
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,285
Speaker 5:  ton of the, of the, the cases. Right.

383
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:41,645
Speaker 4:  Yeah, sure. Having, having parts that they're very good at making very cheaply.

384
00:18:41,645 --> 00:18:41,965
Speaker 4:  So If you

385
00:18:41,965 --> 00:18:45,525
Speaker 5:  Yes. Yeah. Like, like they, they had a ton of those MacBook air,

386
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:49,245
Speaker 5:  original MacBook air casings. Right.

387
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:54,005
Speaker 3:  Tim Cook is like, what are you doing guys? I'm the supply chain guy. Show

388
00:18:54,005 --> 00:18:54,405
Speaker 3:  some N ones,

389
00:18:54,765 --> 00:18:57,805
Speaker 5:  Shove some N ones in them. Send them to Walmart. Send them

390
00:18:57,805 --> 00:19:00,845
Speaker 3:  To Walmart. I think they're still making them. I think they, they've, they've

391
00:19:00,845 --> 00:19:03,605
Speaker 3:  projected out their demand and they're still making them. We have that quote

392
00:19:03,715 --> 00:19:07,685
Speaker 3:  from Walmart in one of our stories where the Walmart guy is like, we're gonna

393
00:19:07,685 --> 00:19:10,565
Speaker 3:  have these for as long as people want them. Yeah. Which has to be,

394
00:19:11,445 --> 00:19:14,845
Speaker 5:  I think it's a huge warehouse like Steven Spielberg style warehouse.

395
00:19:15,505 --> 00:19:18,085
Speaker 5:  And Tim, Tim doesn't like to think about it. You don't bring it up around

396
00:19:18,105 --> 00:19:21,485
Speaker 5:  Tim, but Walmart, Walmart's like, we'll, we'll take care of this for you

397
00:19:21,485 --> 00:19:21,645
Speaker 5:  Tim.

398
00:19:22,165 --> 00:19:25,645
Speaker 6:  Reminder that Apple made the 13 inch Macbook Pro with

399
00:19:25,715 --> 00:19:28,845
Speaker 6:  optical drive for five or six years after

400
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:30,285
Speaker 6:  they stopped selling

401
00:19:30,285 --> 00:19:31,325
Speaker 4:  It. Liam gets it.

402
00:19:31,425 --> 00:19:32,205
Speaker 5:  Oh, thank you Liam.

403
00:19:32,425 --> 00:19:36,125
Speaker 4:  Wow. Yeah. No, this is, I, what I think is true is I think it's less that

404
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:40,005
Speaker 4:  Apple has a warehouse full of them somewhere and more that Apple with

405
00:19:40,005 --> 00:19:43,325
Speaker 4:  that wedge design in particular is now at like unbelievable

406
00:19:43,795 --> 00:19:47,045
Speaker 4:  economies of scale. Yeah, that's right. And to just throw that away, like

407
00:19:47,045 --> 00:19:49,925
Speaker 4:  to get rid of all the tooling that's really expensive and the processes that

408
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:53,765
Speaker 4:  you spin up to do this stuff. Like there is a group of people who

409
00:19:53,835 --> 00:19:57,325
Speaker 4:  want those and will pay that price. And what I think is most surprising is

410
00:19:57,325 --> 00:19:59,845
Speaker 4:  not that these still exist in that Apple would keep making them, but that

411
00:19:59,845 --> 00:20:03,085
Speaker 4:  Apple is interested in selling a $700 laptop at Walmart.

412
00:20:03,725 --> 00:20:07,365
Speaker 4:  Like to me that's a much bigger change than anything else going on here.

413
00:20:07,395 --> 00:20:11,365
Speaker 4:  It's just this is not a thing Apple has ever done before. And it's

414
00:20:11,365 --> 00:20:15,165
Speaker 4:  like, it, there's a world in which you would argue it feels

415
00:20:15,165 --> 00:20:19,005
Speaker 4:  like a company running scared, trying to make money wherever

416
00:20:19,005 --> 00:20:22,445
Speaker 4:  they can. You mean I don't really think it's that, but it is a definite

417
00:20:22,715 --> 00:20:25,245
Speaker 4:  like, strategy change in a way that I think has not been

418
00:20:25,245 --> 00:20:28,405
Speaker 5:  Well Yeah, because talked about, because Walmart is very focused on luxury.

419
00:20:28,555 --> 00:20:32,285
Speaker 5:  Like their, their whole thing is luxury and not Walmart. You take that back.

420
00:20:32,285 --> 00:20:32,525
Speaker 5:  Walmart

421
00:20:32,715 --> 00:20:33,925
Speaker 4:  Very confused, very focused.

422
00:20:34,055 --> 00:20:37,005
Speaker 5:  Lemme lemme read it out. Well I think about Walmart. That's what I think

423
00:20:37,025 --> 00:20:41,005
Speaker 5:  of too. I Yeah, yeah. That, that, that's all switched up. But yeah,

424
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:44,725
Speaker 5:  like Apple is very well known for being all about luxury.

425
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Walmart less so

426
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:51,165
Speaker 4:  Le Yeah. Yeah. They just do different jobs. And like if, if Apple

427
00:20:51,165 --> 00:20:54,845
Speaker 4:  wanted to figure out how to sell the best $500 computer,

428
00:20:55,345 --> 00:20:58,525
Speaker 4:  it probably could have, it probably could have done that. 35 years ago

429
00:20:58,635 --> 00:21:01,845
Speaker 3:  They put that computer in Walmart. It was called the iPad. It has been in

430
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:05,805
Speaker 3:  the Walmart the entire time. Yeah. My two year, you

431
00:21:05,805 --> 00:21:09,645
Speaker 3:  know, in the Woods experience, whole Walmart was the only store I spent a

432
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:13,485
Speaker 3:  lot of time contemplating what electronic products are in Walmart, in

433
00:21:13,485 --> 00:21:14,205
Speaker 3:  Catskill, New York.

434
00:21:16,195 --> 00:21:20,165
Speaker 3:  It's iPhones. All the iPhones including the pros. And it was

435
00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:24,125
Speaker 3:  iPads and then they just didn't put the Macs in there. And now they have

436
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:27,565
Speaker 3:  one Mac. And I think the iPad Mac a $700

437
00:21:27,885 --> 00:21:31,525
Speaker 3:  M1 MacBook air, a wedge design and whatever

438
00:21:31,615 --> 00:21:35,405
Speaker 3:  iPads you can get at Walmart Apple's just like, they, you want the laptops

439
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:39,205
Speaker 3:  like, let's be honest about what people wanna buy here. Yeah. They want laptops.

440
00:21:39,205 --> 00:21:39,565
Speaker 3:  People

441
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:42,765
Speaker 4:  Are gonna go in looking for an M1 MacBook error and there's gonna be a, a

442
00:21:42,765 --> 00:21:46,125
Speaker 4:  sales person who's like, wouldn't you rather have an a

443
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:49,565
Speaker 4:  12.9 inch iPad Pro with a magic keyboard and an Apple pencil that's

444
00:21:49,845 --> 00:21:53,565
Speaker 4:  $1,400 all in and somebody's gonna leave with just like a bag full of

445
00:21:54,205 --> 00:21:56,085
Speaker 4:  nonsense. And they're like, I just wanted a laptop,

446
00:21:56,905 --> 00:22:00,445
Speaker 5:  But not at Walmart. There wouldn't be a sales person at Walmart. That's

447
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:04,325
Speaker 3:  True. It was, it was. Look, I did a lot of shopping at Walmart in the, in

448
00:22:04,325 --> 00:22:08,245
Speaker 3:  my two years of Pandemic Woods living. There was not a

449
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:11,965
Speaker 3:  lot of salespeople around. It was not a thing. But all I'm saying is to,

450
00:22:12,145 --> 00:22:15,725
Speaker 3:  to connect the dots between the two of you. Yeah. The Apple

451
00:22:15,725 --> 00:22:19,485
Speaker 3:  running scared, maybe less scared. Apple

452
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:23,485
Speaker 3:  finding every dollar it can find right now. Yeah. And just

453
00:22:23,765 --> 00:22:27,525
Speaker 3:  squeezing is weird. This is the company that gets rid of its old

454
00:22:27,525 --> 00:22:30,565
Speaker 3:  products. Yeah. Like this is the company that's like, we are gonna cannibalize

455
00:22:30,565 --> 00:22:33,925
Speaker 3:  ourselves and now they're selling three generations of the same laptop.

456
00:22:34,865 --> 00:22:35,605
Speaker 3:  We It's weird.

457
00:22:36,115 --> 00:22:39,365
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's very different. And it, it changed kind of

458
00:22:39,755 --> 00:22:43,605
Speaker 4:  quietly without Yeah. Like they, they they did. Nobody made any noise about

459
00:22:43,605 --> 00:22:46,645
Speaker 4:  it. But now you look and it's like, it it operates like a very different

460
00:22:46,645 --> 00:22:48,445
Speaker 4:  company than it did even just a few years ago.

461
00:22:48,515 --> 00:22:52,045
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And I could probably put killing the extraordinarily wasteful and stupid

462
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:55,885
Speaker 3:  car project. Yeah. This like the pressure on the

463
00:22:55,945 --> 00:22:59,365
Speaker 3:  app store, the anger around the app store antitrust stuff

464
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:03,365
Speaker 3:  and the we're gonna sell more products at more price points than ever. Like

465
00:23:03,385 --> 00:23:04,605
Speaker 3:  all in a line. Yeah,

466
00:23:04,605 --> 00:23:08,245
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. They, they, they saw that like, money is not infinite.

467
00:23:08,715 --> 00:23:11,005
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Which it, it is for them. Yeah.

468
00:23:12,165 --> 00:23:13,045
Speaker 5:  Historically it has been. Yes.

469
00:23:13,365 --> 00:23:16,125
Speaker 3:  But it's just weird. It's just like a weird moment for that company. Yeah.

470
00:23:16,465 --> 00:23:18,685
Speaker 4:  And then there was that, I think it was a Reuters story this week that Apple

471
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:22,245
Speaker 4:  is now working on personal robots. Oh yeah. I was like, okay guys,

472
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:22,725
Speaker 3:  Sure.

473
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,005
Speaker 4:  That'll go good.

474
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:25,485
Speaker 5:  We'll see 'em when we see

475
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:27,525
Speaker 3:  'em. We should mention, by the way, as long as we're talking about Apple,

476
00:23:27,525 --> 00:23:30,405
Speaker 3:  they rolled out personas that just like float around with you this week.

477
00:23:30,565 --> 00:23:34,485
Speaker 3:  Haunting in the Vision Pro. We should watch the video at the videos on

478
00:23:34,505 --> 00:23:38,365
Speaker 3:  our various video platforms. It's like Wes and V

479
00:23:39,065 --> 00:23:42,005
Speaker 3:  and Terrible. They just don't seem happy with each other. I gotta be honest

480
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:45,860
Speaker 3:  with it. I have not wanted to put the Vision Pro back on since I

481
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,845
Speaker 3:  handed our review interview.

482
00:23:47,085 --> 00:23:49,845
Speaker 5:  I was talking to Wes earlier and he was like, I gotta go FaceTime some friends

483
00:23:49,905 --> 00:23:52,405
Speaker 5:  and troll. I'm really good. I'll talk to you later. And I was like, good.

484
00:23:52,475 --> 00:23:52,925
Speaker 5:  Good. Thanks.

485
00:23:52,925 --> 00:23:54,365
Speaker 4:  That feels like the right use of the Vision Pro.

486
00:23:54,365 --> 00:23:55,485
Speaker 5:  That that is the best use.

487
00:23:55,485 --> 00:23:58,805
Speaker 4:  That's a strong use of $3,500. Yeah. Seven outta 10.

488
00:24:00,475 --> 00:24:03,685
Speaker 3:  Alright. Speaking of amazing gadgets, Cranz, you've got one here. Yeah. For

489
00:24:03,685 --> 00:24:04,725
Speaker 3:  opening lightning round.

490
00:24:04,905 --> 00:24:08,845
Speaker 5:  Oh my God. So Chris Welch, if If you, most of you are not in

491
00:24:08,845 --> 00:24:11,805
Speaker 5:  in The Verge office, so you don't get to see Chris as often as than I, as

492
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:15,805
Speaker 5:  as often as I do. But he's had this suitcase

493
00:24:15,985 --> 00:24:19,885
Speaker 5:  at his desk for a while now. And, and the suitcase, I'd always be like, what

494
00:24:19,885 --> 00:24:21,645
Speaker 5:  is that? He'd be like, it's it's, it's a tv.

495
00:24:22,355 --> 00:24:24,005
Speaker 4:  He'd be like, don't ask about the suitcase. Don't

496
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:27,245
Speaker 5:  Ask about the suitcase. And he finally reviewed the suitcase. And what I

497
00:24:27,245 --> 00:24:31,205
Speaker 5:  quickly learned was that everyone has been seeing this LG suitcase

498
00:24:31,385 --> 00:24:35,325
Speaker 5:  TV on TikTok. And so a lot of people

499
00:24:35,325 --> 00:24:39,045
Speaker 5:  are like, oh, oh, Chris finally said it's pretty okay. It's time to get it.

500
00:24:39,105 --> 00:24:42,765
Speaker 5:  But really, but I wanna, I wanna be clear, you probably don't need the

501
00:24:42,765 --> 00:24:45,405
Speaker 5:  $1,200 10 80 p

502
00:24:46,425 --> 00:24:46,645
Speaker 3:  No.

503
00:24:46,745 --> 00:24:50,525
Speaker 5:  27 inch TV in a, in a suitcase. It's cool as

504
00:24:50,525 --> 00:24:51,045
Speaker 5:  hell though.

505
00:24:51,265 --> 00:24:51,965
Speaker 3:  It is very cool.

506
00:24:52,505 --> 00:24:55,845
Speaker 5:  It just like, it hits like, like he, he talked about in, in his review it

507
00:24:55,845 --> 00:24:59,685
Speaker 5:  just hits that gadget spot where you just like, yeah. Want this.

508
00:24:59,795 --> 00:25:03,525
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It's foldy and cliquey and it's a little outlandish. It's a touchscreen

509
00:25:03,525 --> 00:25:06,605
Speaker 3:  for no reason. I sat on the floor and played solitaire for like 25 minutes.

510
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:07,045
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

511
00:25:07,345 --> 00:25:11,285
Speaker 5:  It, you just can do that. 'cause it's, it's fun. Yeah. And I just

512
00:25:11,285 --> 00:25:14,885
Speaker 5:  really, really enjoy the thing. And I think it needs, no, it doesn't need

513
00:25:14,885 --> 00:25:17,965
Speaker 5:  to exist in the world. But also I'm like, well maybe I do need one for my

514
00:25:17,965 --> 00:25:20,885
Speaker 5:  bedroom. 'cause I can't figure out where to put a tv. Maybe I just have a

515
00:25:21,345 --> 00:25:22,045
Speaker 3:  In a suitcase.

516
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:23,005
Speaker 5:  In a little suitcase.

517
00:25:23,145 --> 00:25:23,805
Speaker 3:  The answer's a

518
00:25:24,005 --> 00:25:26,245
Speaker 5:  Suitcase on my bed. Hmm. That'll go

519
00:25:26,245 --> 00:25:27,725
Speaker 3:  Well, you know, you need a ceiling projector.

520
00:25:27,915 --> 00:25:29,005
Speaker 5:  There's a fan up there.

521
00:25:29,505 --> 00:25:33,445
Speaker 3:  Get rid of the fan I saw at, at CES Of course. In some like

522
00:25:33,445 --> 00:25:37,325
Speaker 3:  random booth, like a combo platter, light fan projector. Oh yeah.

523
00:25:37,325 --> 00:25:39,525
Speaker 5:  Oh well there we go. Then I'm done. That's what I'm gonna get.

524
00:25:39,765 --> 00:25:42,565
Speaker 3:  It's good. And obviously when you turn the fan on the whole thing by slightly

525
00:25:43,595 --> 00:25:44,925
Speaker 3:  it's very good. Very good.

526
00:25:44,925 --> 00:25:48,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah. What I can't decide about this TV is whether I want it to be much better

527
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:49,925
Speaker 4:  or much cheaper.

528
00:25:50,235 --> 00:25:50,725
Speaker 5:  That that

529
00:25:50,725 --> 00:25:53,205
Speaker 4:  Was. Because part of me is like, give me the 10 80 piece screen. Give me

530
00:25:53,205 --> 00:25:57,165
Speaker 4:  27 inches, make it 500 bucks. And like, will I buy

531
00:25:57,165 --> 00:26:00,085
Speaker 4:  this thing and take it on vacation with me three times a year? Like Yeah.

532
00:26:00,165 --> 00:26:03,805
Speaker 4:  I probably would. Or am I like I this becomes,

533
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:08,045
Speaker 4:  you know, the the like basement TV for all intents and purposes

534
00:26:08,045 --> 00:26:10,965
Speaker 4:  and I want it to be better than this. And I'm so torn between those two things

535
00:26:10,995 --> 00:26:14,085
Speaker 4:  because $1,200 for what this thing actually is,

536
00:26:15,105 --> 00:26:16,045
Speaker 4:  is too much. It's

537
00:26:16,045 --> 00:26:16,405
Speaker 5:  Ludicrous.

538
00:26:16,405 --> 00:26:19,925
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Both of you have now described wanting this TV to keep it stationary

539
00:26:19,925 --> 00:26:23,685
Speaker 3:  in a room. You're like the basement tv just like buy a TV

540
00:26:23,755 --> 00:26:24,645
Speaker 3:  dude. No, because it

541
00:26:24,995 --> 00:26:25,885
Speaker 5:  Doesn't turn into a

542
00:26:26,045 --> 00:26:29,765
Speaker 3:  Suitcase. Just like buy a tv. Yeah. But why the purpose of a suitcase

543
00:26:29,945 --> 00:26:31,125
Speaker 3:  is that you take it with you.

544
00:26:31,955 --> 00:26:35,365
Speaker 4:  It's my vacation tv. I will say the thing where they're like,

545
00:26:36,025 --> 00:26:39,405
Speaker 4:  put it in the bed of your truck and watch TV is like

546
00:26:39,705 --> 00:26:40,125
Speaker 3:  The dream.

547
00:26:40,585 --> 00:26:44,565
Speaker 4:  It is the dream. It is also just the most specific use case. It's

548
00:26:44,565 --> 00:26:47,765
Speaker 4:  like, I'm going to tailgate with this thing six times a week

549
00:26:48,425 --> 00:26:48,965
Speaker 4:  and it's gonna

550
00:26:48,965 --> 00:26:49,565
Speaker 3:  Be worth it.

551
00:26:50,235 --> 00:26:53,925
Speaker 4:  Like If, you are a season ticket holder to something. Yeah. Yeah. Buy this

552
00:26:53,925 --> 00:26:55,725
Speaker 4:  television. Like that's, that's where I'm at. It

553
00:26:55,725 --> 00:26:58,565
Speaker 3:  Is true. Chris's basic point was like, we need more gadgets again. Which

554
00:26:58,565 --> 00:26:58,685
Speaker 3:  is

555
00:26:59,645 --> 00:27:00,165
Speaker 4:  Absolutely direct

556
00:27:00,165 --> 00:27:03,605
Speaker 3:  Pull on my heartstrings. Well it is. It do I think it should be cheaper?

557
00:27:03,725 --> 00:27:05,725
Speaker 3:  I don't think it should be better. I think it should be cheaper. He,

558
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:09,005
Speaker 5:  He made a good point that he understood why it was so expensive because it

559
00:27:09,005 --> 00:27:12,405
Speaker 5:  is such a niche product and he's like, if they made it better then it would

560
00:27:12,405 --> 00:27:15,885
Speaker 5:  just be more expensive. $1,200 is also expensive. But like,

561
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:18,525
Speaker 5:  I don't, I don't know if I fully buy it, but

562
00:27:18,965 --> 00:27:21,925
Speaker 3:  I actually don't buy that at all. Like, you don't, LG can make a good TV

563
00:27:22,025 --> 00:27:25,725
Speaker 3:  for virtually no money. Right. All they've really done here is buy a suitcase.

564
00:27:25,955 --> 00:27:27,805
Speaker 5:  They they put it in a six suitcase.

565
00:27:27,835 --> 00:27:31,765
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It really is just a TV and a hinge. Yeah. Like it's not

566
00:27:32,325 --> 00:27:34,285
Speaker 5:  Particularly, but you can, you can plug stuff into it.

567
00:27:35,025 --> 00:27:35,765
Speaker 4:  You can plug stuff,

568
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:39,245
Speaker 5:  You can play your switch on it. It's, it's got a touch screen so you can,

569
00:27:39,245 --> 00:27:40,645
Speaker 5:  like, you play

570
00:27:40,645 --> 00:27:42,205
Speaker 3:  Solitaire, you buy, you should buy one. There's just something. Buy one right

571
00:27:42,205 --> 00:27:45,165
Speaker 4:  Now. David, there's just something about this one picture in the review where

572
00:27:45,265 --> 00:27:49,205
Speaker 4:  the, the TV is on a couch and it's, it's folded up. The suitcase

573
00:27:49,205 --> 00:27:52,845
Speaker 4:  is open, it's flat and there's two people on either side of it playing

574
00:27:52,855 --> 00:27:56,405
Speaker 4:  chess. And this picture is both like truly

575
00:27:56,705 --> 00:28:00,525
Speaker 4:  absurd because I cannot imagine regular people ever actually doing this

576
00:28:00,705 --> 00:28:02,445
Speaker 4:  and also makes me want it so bad.

577
00:28:03,105 --> 00:28:06,645
Speaker 5:  And you can see that that that that whole conflict in their faces too

578
00:28:06,945 --> 00:28:07,525
Speaker 5:  in the photo.

579
00:28:07,995 --> 00:28:11,765
Speaker 4:  Yeah. They're kind of like, what is this bad chess app that I'm playing with

580
00:28:11,765 --> 00:28:13,165
Speaker 4:  this enormous television but

581
00:28:13,165 --> 00:28:14,645
Speaker 5:  I'm also having a good time. Yeah.

582
00:28:15,065 --> 00:28:19,005
Speaker 3:  Who doesn't have a good time playing Web os? Chess on Suitcase tv.

583
00:28:20,395 --> 00:28:24,085
Speaker 3:  Alright. Speaking of gadgets, my lightning round is the yearly printer

584
00:28:24,585 --> 00:28:26,485
Speaker 3:  review was published.

585
00:28:26,995 --> 00:28:27,765
Speaker 4:  It's big day for you.

586
00:28:27,865 --> 00:28:29,125
Speaker 3:  Big day for me. This

587
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,565
Speaker 4:  Is what I assume you did on vacation the whole time. It was just plan your

588
00:28:31,595 --> 00:28:33,325
Speaker 4:  epic comeback with the printer.

589
00:28:33,905 --> 00:28:37,765
Speaker 3:  So If, you don't know something is happening to Google search right

590
00:28:37,765 --> 00:28:41,485
Speaker 3:  now where various websites,

591
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:45,445
Speaker 3:  the traffic is declining because Google changed the algorithm

592
00:28:46,205 --> 00:28:49,285
Speaker 3:  and some of them are, we did a decoder with Mia about one of them. House

593
00:28:49,285 --> 00:28:53,125
Speaker 3:  Fresh, the air purifier blog. There's a retro gaming site who's a

594
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:55,805
Speaker 3:  editor in chief or owner or someone who's complaining on Twitter. Their traffic

595
00:28:55,865 --> 00:28:59,405
Speaker 3:  is, and then a bunch of like content farms. Right. Also.

596
00:28:59,465 --> 00:29:03,005
Speaker 4:  And the idea is to kill the content farms. Yeah. But it it, they are

597
00:29:04,365 --> 00:29:06,725
Speaker 4:  catching some of the good carrying sites.

598
00:29:07,285 --> 00:29:09,245
Speaker 5:  A lot of people catching the strays on this one.

599
00:29:09,475 --> 00:29:09,765
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

600
00:29:09,835 --> 00:29:13,725
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It's, it's something like the internet as we know it. I believe

601
00:29:13,725 --> 00:29:16,565
Speaker 3:  this to be true. The internet as we know it is about to fall apart.

602
00:29:17,345 --> 00:29:18,285
Speaker 4:  Oh I really agree with that. Yeah.

603
00:29:19,115 --> 00:29:23,005
Speaker 3:  Something weird is happening on the internet out there. So my

604
00:29:23,365 --> 00:29:26,885
Speaker 3:  contribution to that is to make stories

605
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:28,565
Speaker 3:  that pointed out

606
00:29:30,985 --> 00:29:34,605
Speaker 3:  by using the form of the stories, the content farms.

607
00:29:35,675 --> 00:29:37,445
Speaker 4:  It's a very Meta art project. Yeah.

608
00:29:37,445 --> 00:29:41,245
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I think The Verge should be an art project. So the answer to the question,

609
00:29:41,245 --> 00:29:45,085
Speaker 3:  what is the Best printer has been unchanging for a decade, which is the cheapest

610
00:29:45,085 --> 00:29:48,125
Speaker 3:  brother laser printer you can find. Yep. But

611
00:29:48,835 --> 00:29:52,805
Speaker 3:  that is like Google cannot accept that as an answer because it's not

612
00:29:52,805 --> 00:29:56,485
Speaker 3:  new enough. 'cause there's not enough shopping links because the

613
00:29:56,675 --> 00:29:58,285
Speaker 3:  data isn't semantic enough. How

614
00:29:58,285 --> 00:30:00,205
Speaker 5:  Many H twos you got in that, that piece?

615
00:30:00,445 --> 00:30:00,845
Speaker 3:  I have one.

616
00:30:01,335 --> 00:30:02,405
Speaker 5:  Gotta have it. And

617
00:30:02,405 --> 00:30:05,485
Speaker 3:  It's just, just me pointing out that lms dunno the answer to the question

618
00:30:05,505 --> 00:30:09,405
Speaker 3:  yet. Anyway. So I wrote the piece once again. We have sold

619
00:30:09,405 --> 00:30:10,565
Speaker 3:  like 2000 printers.

620
00:30:10,635 --> 00:30:11,125
Speaker 4:  It's amazing.

621
00:30:12,495 --> 00:30:15,605
Speaker 3:  Which is just like the funniest part of this whole thing. It's

622
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:16,165
Speaker 4:  Like's the favorite

623
00:30:16,165 --> 00:30:18,965
Speaker 3:  Part. It's easily, the funniest part of this whole thing is like, what should

624
00:30:18,965 --> 00:30:21,965
Speaker 3:  this actually look like? It should just be like, just buy this one and shut

625
00:30:21,965 --> 00:30:25,005
Speaker 3:  up. Like that's all anyone wants on the internet when they're looking for

626
00:30:25,005 --> 00:30:25,925
Speaker 3:  product advice. And

627
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:26,605
Speaker 5:  Google's like, no,

628
00:30:26,705 --> 00:30:30,005
Speaker 3:  And Google won't do it. You have to update the page. So you look at the internet

629
00:30:30,345 --> 00:30:32,925
Speaker 3:  and you're like, you type in Best printer and all the top results are like

630
00:30:33,395 --> 00:30:37,045
Speaker 3:  updated last week to point out that a a

631
00:30:37,225 --> 00:30:41,205
Speaker 3:  bad product is the new winner. Or like they, we like, we changed our

632
00:30:41,205 --> 00:30:44,845
Speaker 3:  methodology. And you look at the number of sites that one

633
00:30:45,455 --> 00:30:49,445
Speaker 3:  claim to have reviewed every printer and then claim

634
00:30:49,445 --> 00:30:53,285
Speaker 3:  to have updated those printer reviews yesterday and then also get the

635
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:54,205
Speaker 3:  answer like

636
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:58,285
Speaker 5:  Updating it on January 1st, 2024. So that you to say

637
00:30:58,285 --> 00:30:59,245
Speaker 5:  they've updated it in

638
00:30:59,245 --> 00:31:01,125
Speaker 4:  January 1st, 2024. Yeah. 2024.

639
00:31:01,475 --> 00:31:01,765
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

640
00:31:01,795 --> 00:31:05,245
Speaker 4:  It's cool. It is. So my, my big edit to you in this story was to add a bunch

641
00:31:05,245 --> 00:31:07,965
Speaker 4:  of links to the kinds of things you're talking about. And some of it is is

642
00:31:07,965 --> 00:31:11,885
Speaker 4:  just truly wild. And it's like, I feel like everybody has seen these at some

643
00:31:11,885 --> 00:31:14,525
Speaker 4:  point, right? That you Google one of these and you go onto some site you've

644
00:31:14,525 --> 00:31:18,245
Speaker 4:  never heard of and it's basically just like a product name. People on Amazon

645
00:31:18,245 --> 00:31:21,125
Speaker 4:  like it, here's what they say. Copy and paste a bunch of Amazon results and,

646
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:24,165
Speaker 4:  and call it a day. But the like, one of them is on

647
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:28,165
Speaker 4:  people.com, the eight best home printers of 2024 tested and reviewed.

648
00:31:28,275 --> 00:31:31,765
Speaker 4:  Like nothing against, I have not even read this piece, I don't know, but

649
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:35,645
Speaker 4:  what in the world is People magazine doing caring about printers? Yeah. Like

650
00:31:35,745 --> 00:31:37,205
Speaker 4:  how is this what the internet has become?

651
00:31:37,205 --> 00:31:38,605
Speaker 5:  That's how they print the magazine out.

652
00:31:39,235 --> 00:31:43,005
Speaker 3:  It's like CBS news I think was my favorite one. And then I realized

653
00:31:43,005 --> 00:31:46,965
Speaker 3:  like the demographic of CBS news might be looking for printers. I

654
00:31:46,965 --> 00:31:50,725
Speaker 3:  don't know the answer to that question. It's, it's just a very odd that If

655
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:54,325
Speaker 3:  you like, look at the architecture of our internet. A lot of people are like

656
00:31:54,325 --> 00:31:57,845
Speaker 3:  affiliate weird affiliate clicks will pay for everything.

657
00:31:58,745 --> 00:32:02,685
Speaker 3:  And then you just look at what that means in practice, which is trying to

658
00:32:02,685 --> 00:32:06,645
Speaker 3:  game Google search to get those affiliate clicks and that we're in

659
00:32:06,645 --> 00:32:07,605
Speaker 3:  the death spiral. Right?

660
00:32:07,605 --> 00:32:10,965
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Well and one of the things Google has been trying to take away recently

661
00:32:11,225 --> 00:32:15,125
Speaker 4:  is sites that not only do that but try to hide it that all have a sort of

662
00:32:16,025 --> 00:32:19,965
Speaker 4:  sneaky navigational part of their site that's not in the nav.

663
00:32:19,965 --> 00:32:22,765
Speaker 4:  They never put it on the homepage. You can never find it. It's like parts

664
00:32:22,765 --> 00:32:26,445
Speaker 4:  of these websites exist exclusively for Google. It's not just stuff that

665
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:29,845
Speaker 4:  is like made because you see it on Google Trends, which a lot of people do.

666
00:32:29,845 --> 00:32:32,165
Speaker 4:  And that's like, that's a thing we think about. It's a thing everybody thinks

667
00:32:32,165 --> 00:32:35,645
Speaker 4:  about. Like knowing what people wanna know is fine. But like when you go

668
00:32:35,645 --> 00:32:39,525
Speaker 4:  to this deep, deep hole of like, we are going to actively wall

669
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:42,005
Speaker 4:  this off from the rest of our site so that the people who come here on purpose

670
00:32:42,055 --> 00:32:46,045
Speaker 4:  never even find it. Yeah. It's like that's tough. And that is, that is now

671
00:32:46,085 --> 00:32:48,765
Speaker 4:  a game. A lot of people feel like they have to play

672
00:32:48,865 --> 00:32:52,565
Speaker 5:  People doesn't you? You can find it on the people page. Yeah. People, I just

673
00:32:52,565 --> 00:32:52,925
Speaker 5:  had to go check

674
00:32:52,925 --> 00:32:54,685
Speaker 4:  People's like, what's up guys? We love printers.

675
00:32:55,385 --> 00:32:56,925
Speaker 5:  No, they also love what's

676
00:32:56,925 --> 00:32:58,365
Speaker 4:  Ryan Reynolds up to? Printers,

677
00:32:58,515 --> 00:32:59,325
Speaker 5:  Pool cleaners.

678
00:32:59,635 --> 00:33:00,685
Speaker 4:  Sure. That's

679
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,525
Speaker 5:  Sh and Dandruff shampoo.

680
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:04,165
Speaker 4:  That's, this is the stuff. Yeah.

681
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:08,045
Speaker 3:  It's, it's just very odd. It's a very odd moment on the internet. I like

682
00:33:08,055 --> 00:33:08,925
Speaker 3:  fully believe

683
00:33:10,435 --> 00:33:13,925
Speaker 3:  that this is not sustainable like in any way, shape or form. I give it a

684
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:17,645
Speaker 3:  year before like the Google fight Internet

685
00:33:18,095 --> 00:33:19,845
Speaker 3:  turns into whatever the next thing's gonna be.

686
00:33:20,805 --> 00:33:23,685
Speaker 4:  I think that's probably right. There was a really interesting, the folks

687
00:33:23,685 --> 00:33:27,205
Speaker 4:  at 4 0 4 Media the other day wrote about a search engine called Coy, which

688
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:30,205
Speaker 4:  is the one I've used and been talking about for a while. And I just like

689
00:33:30,505 --> 00:33:32,725
Speaker 4:  posted about it and was like, oh yeah, this is good. I've been using it for

690
00:33:32,725 --> 00:33:34,725
Speaker 4:  a while. This is a good story. They were talking about how much better it

691
00:33:34,725 --> 00:33:38,685
Speaker 4:  is than Google and shocked at the number of people I got who were like,

692
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:42,205
Speaker 4:  I'm done with Google, I'm out. I'm over it. I've moved on. I finally switched.

693
00:33:42,465 --> 00:33:46,405
Speaker 4:  And I feel like Google has had this sort of like inevitability for so

694
00:33:46,405 --> 00:33:50,045
Speaker 4:  long that I just feel starting to crack in a lot of ways. Yeah. Like I think

695
00:33:50,255 --> 00:33:54,165
Speaker 4:  there is this sense that Google is not the

696
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:57,885
Speaker 4:  only option anymore. And I think AI has kind of undone that in people's

697
00:33:57,885 --> 00:34:00,965
Speaker 4:  brains, even though AI is not actually that good at a lot of search things.

698
00:34:01,345 --> 00:34:05,325
Speaker 4:  But it does, it feels like Google being sort of too

699
00:34:05,325 --> 00:34:09,325
Speaker 4:  Google to fail feels like it's slipping. What was the most in a really interesting

700
00:34:09,325 --> 00:34:09,485
Speaker 4:  way,

701
00:34:09,705 --> 00:34:13,645
Speaker 5:  Recent like search you went to do and Google

702
00:34:13,675 --> 00:34:14,805
Speaker 5:  just totally failed you.

703
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:19,005
Speaker 4:  I haven't used Google in a while, if I'm being honest. Okay.

704
00:34:19,235 --> 00:34:19,525
Speaker 5:  What

705
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:19,645
Speaker 4:  About

706
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:23,925
Speaker 5:  IUII still use it and I still am like, wow, it sucks every day that I don't

707
00:34:24,025 --> 00:34:24,445
Speaker 5:  change

708
00:34:24,985 --> 00:34:27,365
Speaker 3:  My behavior. So it's not a straight Google search. But I actually haven't

709
00:34:27,485 --> 00:34:30,125
Speaker 3:  answered this question 'cause I I've been thinking about it ever since this

710
00:34:30,445 --> 00:34:33,645
Speaker 3:  happened. Yeah. I have a Google, I don't even know what they call them anymore.

711
00:34:33,765 --> 00:34:36,725
Speaker 3:  A net a go. you know, a circle that runs Google Assistant in my bathroom,

712
00:34:37,405 --> 00:34:40,645
Speaker 3:  A Nest hub. What are they called now? Sure, sure. Have they killed Nest yet?

713
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:42,285
Speaker 3:  Yeah. A Google home. Yeah.

714
00:34:42,315 --> 00:34:43,285
Speaker 5:  It's it's one of those,

715
00:34:43,885 --> 00:34:47,125
Speaker 3:  You know, a circle? Yeah. Like a fabric circle with a microphone in it. Google

716
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:48,085
Speaker 3:  Circle. A Google thing.

717
00:34:50,645 --> 00:34:52,405
Speaker 3:  I should know the name of this product. Is it the little

718
00:34:52,405 --> 00:34:52,845
Speaker 4:  Guy? Is

719
00:34:52,845 --> 00:34:55,445
Speaker 3:  It the Home Mini? It's it's a nest tub. Yeah, it's a home mini. Okay. Is

720
00:34:55,445 --> 00:34:55,765
Speaker 3:  that what it is?

721
00:34:55,995 --> 00:34:56,285
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

722
00:34:57,005 --> 00:34:57,725
Speaker 3:  A circle. The

723
00:34:57,725 --> 00:34:59,565
Speaker 4:  Little the little guy. Yeah. With the big hockey puck kind.

724
00:34:59,805 --> 00:35:02,605
Speaker 3:  I highly recommend putting one of those in your bathroom. They're very useful

725
00:35:02,605 --> 00:35:06,565
Speaker 3:  in there. And I, you know, I sometimes I have to play a podcast in

726
00:35:06,565 --> 00:35:08,925
Speaker 3:  the morning. Sometimes I just have it set a time like all this stuff. Yeah.

727
00:35:09,345 --> 00:35:12,525
Speaker 3:  And I asked it how long it would take to drive to the airport

728
00:35:13,225 --> 00:35:15,925
Speaker 3:  and first it answered and with a number of miles

729
00:35:17,265 --> 00:35:20,365
Speaker 3:  and then it said I can't. And I said, well, well how many minutes will that

730
00:35:20,365 --> 00:35:23,645
Speaker 3:  take? And it just couldn't. And then it sent me some, some stuff on the web

731
00:35:24,105 --> 00:35:27,845
Speaker 3:  and I was like, all of this ai, like all of this

732
00:35:27,985 --> 00:35:29,925
Speaker 3:  AI and Google maps. Yeah.

733
00:35:29,925 --> 00:35:31,565
Speaker 4:  Like you have that, you have there,

734
00:35:31,745 --> 00:35:32,365
Speaker 5:  All of the skills are

735
00:35:32,365 --> 00:35:34,725
Speaker 3:  Right there. If I just ask Google Maps this question, it would immediately

736
00:35:34,725 --> 00:35:38,685
Speaker 3:  deliver me that answer and you can't. And it's like, well we

737
00:35:38,685 --> 00:35:42,445
Speaker 3:  just didn't close the loop. Yep. And that to me, I was like, oh, I should

738
00:35:42,445 --> 00:35:46,165
Speaker 3:  have just tried something. Anything else would've been fine. And I, I think

739
00:35:46,165 --> 00:35:50,045
Speaker 3:  that that's like the Google loop closing. Hopefully they get

740
00:35:50,045 --> 00:35:53,685
Speaker 3:  better at it. It's like they've had a long time. You wrote about this this

741
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:53,765
Speaker 3:  week.

742
00:35:53,855 --> 00:35:55,565
Speaker 4:  We're we're gonna get to that, don't you worry.

743
00:35:57,985 --> 00:36:00,765
Speaker 3:  But yeah, that, that's the last one that really failed for me. And I was

744
00:36:00,765 --> 00:36:04,685
Speaker 3:  just like, how is it possible? Like even if at this point if Gemini had

745
00:36:04,685 --> 00:36:08,485
Speaker 3:  just lied to me Yeah. And in like 45 minutes. I don't know. That's prior.

746
00:36:08,675 --> 00:36:12,405
Speaker 3:  It's, it's seems right. Yeah, sure. Right. That feels right. Yeah. About

747
00:36:12,405 --> 00:36:15,685
Speaker 3:  45 minutes. Yeah. Yeah. Like it would've been better than just like, I don't

748
00:36:15,685 --> 00:36:15,805
Speaker 3:  know.

749
00:36:16,385 --> 00:36:16,605
Speaker 4:  Yes.

750
00:36:17,035 --> 00:36:21,005
Speaker 3:  Like there's nothing less useful than asking a robot how far away

751
00:36:21,005 --> 00:36:24,285
Speaker 3:  something is and it's like 25 miles and it's like, cool. Okay, what does

752
00:36:24,285 --> 00:36:25,525
Speaker 3:  that mean to me at this point in

753
00:36:25,525 --> 00:36:26,285
Speaker 4:  Time? Should I run?

754
00:36:26,765 --> 00:36:27,005
Speaker 3:  Like,

755
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:28,405
Speaker 4:  What's the plan here?

756
00:36:29,835 --> 00:36:30,805
Speaker 5:  Just hustling.

757
00:36:30,805 --> 00:36:32,605
Speaker 3:  What's your last one at Google Field, don't you?

758
00:36:33,635 --> 00:36:36,325
Speaker 5:  Yesterday I was trying to decide, I asked it

759
00:36:37,225 --> 00:36:40,765
Speaker 5:  should I get an impact driver if I already have a regular like power?

760
00:36:41,025 --> 00:36:42,925
Speaker 3:  Oh, that's impossible. That's like too hard.

761
00:36:43,245 --> 00:36:45,565
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it was too hard for it. It was like, no. And I was like, what power

762
00:36:45,565 --> 00:36:48,645
Speaker 5:  tools should I get? And it was like, here's all the power tools for carpentry.

763
00:36:48,645 --> 00:36:51,405
Speaker 5:  And I was like, I didn't, I just wanted to know what power tools should,

764
00:36:51,405 --> 00:36:55,365
Speaker 5:  like a nerd who wants more power tools get you failed me. I got really

765
00:36:55,365 --> 00:36:55,605
Speaker 5:  upset.

766
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:56,485
Speaker 3:  That's a really hard,

767
00:36:57,285 --> 00:36:58,005
Speaker 5:  A hard, I went

768
00:36:58,145 --> 00:37:00,845
Speaker 3:  Too hard. Maybe you really, you've opened like that's a Pandora's Box question.

769
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:04,045
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Like I have seen videos of people arguing that,

770
00:37:04,675 --> 00:37:08,285
Speaker 3:  that the housing crisis caused people to switch from standard drills to impacts.

771
00:37:09,045 --> 00:37:11,565
Speaker 3:  'cause all the people with experience building houses got forced outta the

772
00:37:11,565 --> 00:37:14,405
Speaker 3:  market and the kids didn't know what they were doing. Like you're touching

773
00:37:14,405 --> 00:37:18,325
Speaker 3:  on a third rail of power tools to that question. It's like somewhere a data

774
00:37:18,325 --> 00:37:20,485
Speaker 3:  center exploded because you ask Google that question.

775
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:23,765
Speaker 5:  I went like, I had to go like a couple of links in just, I was like, I need

776
00:37:23,765 --> 00:37:26,925
Speaker 5:  something that's not people trying to sell me power tools. Yeah. And, and

777
00:37:26,925 --> 00:37:30,165
Speaker 5:  eventually I got like some people debating impact drivers and they're like,

778
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:33,165
Speaker 5:  yeah, If, you, you got a lot of sheet rock you got or not sheet rock. You

779
00:37:33,165 --> 00:37:36,005
Speaker 5:  got a lot of drywall, you gotta get up. You get that impact driver change

780
00:37:36,005 --> 00:37:38,085
Speaker 5:  your life. And I was like, well I don't have that.

781
00:37:38,265 --> 00:37:41,285
Speaker 3:  Our publisher Chris Grant is about to run in here. He If you are just generally

782
00:37:41,285 --> 00:37:43,405
Speaker 3:  talking about power tools. He's gonna, he's gonna go crazy. Kick the door

783
00:37:43,405 --> 00:37:43,565
Speaker 5:  Open.

784
00:37:44,725 --> 00:37:48,445
Speaker 3:  Well, I was just saying, but this is my, my prediction a year from now

785
00:37:49,345 --> 00:37:52,605
Speaker 3:  market what, what day is it? April 4th Market a year from now.

786
00:37:53,285 --> 00:37:55,485
Speaker 3:  Whatever Google is today will look radically different.

787
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:56,685
Speaker 5:  Hey Siri,

788
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:01,325
Speaker 4:  I No, I agree. And I think, I think Google knows that too. Yeah. I'm not

789
00:38:01,325 --> 00:38:04,845
Speaker 4:  sure they know what to do about it. Do you see the, I don't know if it was

790
00:38:04,845 --> 00:38:07,885
Speaker 4:  a rumor or a report, but there was, I just saw, 'cause some something go

791
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:11,685
Speaker 4:  by basically saying that Google is now considering charging for its

792
00:38:11,705 --> 00:38:15,565
Speaker 4:  AI stuff, which I find totally fascinating. Like the, the actual

793
00:38:15,745 --> 00:38:19,565
Speaker 4:  AI search stuff would be a paid thing instead of a free thing. Messy and

794
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:23,245
Speaker 4:  complicated. But like you get the sense Google knows it can't be

795
00:38:23,315 --> 00:38:26,765
Speaker 4:  like this for much longer and it's flailing in a bunch of directions trying

796
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:30,205
Speaker 4:  to fix it. But I think it seems like the internet is getting crazy

797
00:38:30,705 --> 00:38:33,725
Speaker 4:  faster than Google is getting good at doing things about

798
00:38:34,065 --> 00:38:36,605
Speaker 5:  The solution. They just need to sell some shit in Walmart.

799
00:38:38,135 --> 00:38:40,845
Speaker 5:  Knock $200 off. Sell it in Walmart. You'll be fine. Yeah. Yeah.

800
00:38:42,315 --> 00:38:46,205
Speaker 3:  Some other AI stuff for lightning round. Microsoft is working

801
00:38:46,225 --> 00:38:49,205
Speaker 3:  at Xbox ai chatbot a scoop from Tom Warren.

802
00:38:50,075 --> 00:38:51,405
Speaker 5:  It's just clippy for Xbox

803
00:38:51,945 --> 00:38:54,445
Speaker 4:  And he's right that it needs to be called Xbo. I just thought

804
00:38:54,675 --> 00:38:58,445
Speaker 3:  That it does need to be called X Bot. That is correct. The we Microsoft confirmed

805
00:38:58,445 --> 00:39:02,045
Speaker 3:  it. We are testing an Xbox support virtual agent. An internal

806
00:39:02,045 --> 00:39:05,605
Speaker 3:  prototype of an animated character that can query Xbox support topics

807
00:39:05,915 --> 00:39:09,805
Speaker 3:  with voice or text. This is the general manager of gaming AI at Xbox.

808
00:39:10,465 --> 00:39:13,965
Speaker 3:  The prototype makes it easier and quicker for players to get help with support

809
00:39:13,965 --> 00:39:17,885
Speaker 3:  topics using natural language taking. It's like, this is great, this is

810
00:39:17,885 --> 00:39:21,605
Speaker 3:  cool, but like, how many people are on the daily just like

811
00:39:21,605 --> 00:39:23,365
Speaker 3:  asking Xbox support for help.

812
00:39:24,305 --> 00:39:27,765
Speaker 4:  Why did I lose it? fifa. No, I, the, I mean

813
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:29,685
Speaker 4:  customer support AI is like,

814
00:39:30,275 --> 00:39:30,685
Speaker 3:  It's common

815
00:39:30,955 --> 00:39:34,525
Speaker 4:  Done. Like that's, that is good or bad. That is The future of everything,

816
00:39:34,525 --> 00:39:38,165
Speaker 4:  right? Like all the, the robot phone trees are gonna be replaced by

817
00:39:38,165 --> 00:39:40,565
Speaker 4:  chatbots. And that's just where we're headed. And that's kinda what this

818
00:39:40,565 --> 00:39:44,365
Speaker 4:  sounds like. I think there is possibly more Xbox could do here,

819
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:46,925
Speaker 4:  but Yeah. So it's somewhere. It just sounds like it's gonna be an adorable

820
00:39:46,925 --> 00:39:47,925
Speaker 4:  little customer service guy.

821
00:39:47,945 --> 00:39:51,645
Speaker 5:  No way. I, I love this idea of it killing phone crees though. Like if

822
00:39:51,865 --> 00:39:54,485
Speaker 5:  AI kills the phone, Cree, oh my God.

823
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,525
Speaker 4:  Oh that's coming. I really, I That's hard to hear.

824
00:39:56,755 --> 00:39:57,645
Speaker 5:  It's game changed. Changed.

825
00:39:57,755 --> 00:40:01,325
Speaker 4:  It's like, it just, frankly like just online chat,

826
00:40:01,645 --> 00:40:04,765
Speaker 4:  customer service over having to call and wait for a human was delightful.

827
00:40:05,305 --> 00:40:09,205
Speaker 4:  Now all of that is just being replaced by AI bots who are like, yeah,

828
00:40:09,205 --> 00:40:13,045
Speaker 4:  helpful. And my favorite thing is the people who go on to those

829
00:40:13,045 --> 00:40:15,725
Speaker 4:  things. Like the people who went to the car rental company and asked it to

830
00:40:15,725 --> 00:40:19,405
Speaker 4:  like do all kinds of weird stuff. Like this stuff is gonna get bad and crazy

831
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:23,405
Speaker 4:  and weird. But that is, I think at this moment probably the most

832
00:40:23,675 --> 00:40:27,525
Speaker 4:  slam dunk Yeah. Business use case for all of this. It is just

833
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,165
Speaker 4:  going to eat the customer service industry.

834
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:33,085
Speaker 3:  Right. 'cause all of, I mean, working customer support is not fun.

835
00:40:33,345 --> 00:40:36,805
Speaker 3:  You are mostly reading scripts of people. Yeah. Just have a robot read the

836
00:40:36,805 --> 00:40:39,845
Speaker 3:  script. Yeah. I just wanna know how they will all respond to me just mashing

837
00:40:39,845 --> 00:40:41,085
Speaker 3:  the zero button over and over

838
00:40:41,085 --> 00:40:41,325
Speaker 5:  Again,

839
00:40:41,535 --> 00:40:42,085
Speaker 3:  Which is all

840
00:40:42,085 --> 00:40:43,285
Speaker 4:  Representative, human

841
00:40:43,765 --> 00:40:44,325
Speaker 3:  Representative.

842
00:40:46,225 --> 00:40:50,165
Speaker 3:  No, thank you. I feel like I never call a phone tree with a problem.

843
00:40:50,185 --> 00:40:53,725
Speaker 3:  The phone tree is designed to solve. Never. It's like I don't need to check

844
00:40:53,725 --> 00:40:56,485
Speaker 3:  my balance. Like I can definitely do that on my phone. Yeah. you know, it's

845
00:40:56,485 --> 00:40:57,605
Speaker 3:  like I need to do something hard.

846
00:40:57,945 --> 00:41:01,605
Speaker 5:  Who calls to check their balance still. Like why are they offering that still?

847
00:41:01,605 --> 00:41:04,165
Speaker 5:  Because I, I've noticed that too. I called the bank and they're like, do

848
00:41:04,165 --> 00:41:06,645
Speaker 5:  you wanna check your balance? I'm like, no, no. I'm, I'm looking at the app

849
00:41:06,645 --> 00:41:08,085
Speaker 5:  right now that told me to call you.

850
00:41:08,995 --> 00:41:11,405
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I'm gonna start calling to check my balance. Yeah.

851
00:41:12,105 --> 00:41:12,645
Speaker 4:  How am I doing?

852
00:41:13,385 --> 00:41:14,805
Speaker 3:  What's up? Like I gotta talk to somebody.

853
00:41:17,035 --> 00:41:20,765
Speaker 3:  Samsung says Bixby is not dead.

854
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,205
Speaker 3:  Which is an incredible thing to say.

855
00:41:25,395 --> 00:41:29,165
Speaker 3:  Like, because it implies that Bick, everyone thinks

856
00:41:29,215 --> 00:41:29,885
Speaker 3:  Bixby is dead.

857
00:41:29,885 --> 00:41:33,645
Speaker 4:  Right. My T-shirt that says no Bixby is not dead is causing a lot of

858
00:41:33,805 --> 00:41:33,925
Speaker 4:  questions.

859
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:37,485
Speaker 3:  Yeah. A Samsung executive tells CNBC that the company is quote, working

860
00:41:37,705 --> 00:41:38,205
Speaker 3:  so hard

861
00:41:40,025 --> 00:41:44,005
Speaker 3:  to put AI features in Bixby, even though they just did a big deal with Google

862
00:41:44,025 --> 00:41:46,685
Speaker 3:  and Gemini is now all over the phone and the phones are running. Gemini.

863
00:41:46,685 --> 00:41:50,445
Speaker 3:  Mini Gemini Nano. I'm not great at Google product

864
00:41:50,445 --> 00:41:54,205
Speaker 3:  names today. Google don't either. Vacation, you know,

865
00:41:54,205 --> 00:41:58,165
Speaker 3:  there was a big awards banquet this week. The awards I drank

866
00:41:58,205 --> 00:42:01,005
Speaker 3:  a lot at them. Just like Google stuff. Google Circle,

867
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:04,765
Speaker 3:  Gemini. Tiny. That's yeah, you're doing great. It's

868
00:42:04,765 --> 00:42:04,845
Speaker 5:  Fine.

869
00:42:05,145 --> 00:42:08,445
Speaker 4:  You're as, you're as good as anybody including most of Google's product managers.

870
00:42:08,475 --> 00:42:08,965
Speaker 4:  Like don't

871
00:42:08,965 --> 00:42:12,885
Speaker 3:  Worry about. So If, you'll recall when Bixby was announced dog

872
00:42:12,885 --> 00:42:16,725
Speaker 3:  with shoes. If. you are not caught up on Vergecast lore.

873
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:21,165
Speaker 3:  Bixby the name sounds like a dog wearing shoes. That's the entire

874
00:42:21,315 --> 00:42:21,605
Speaker 3:  joke.

875
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:23,365
Speaker 4:  That's it. Yeah.

876
00:42:23,365 --> 00:42:24,365
Speaker 5:  That's a good joke. Like

877
00:42:24,365 --> 00:42:27,765
Speaker 3:  If, you were imagine If, you were to draw a picture of something called Bixby.

878
00:42:28,185 --> 00:42:29,845
Speaker 3:  You would imagine a dog wearing shoes

879
00:42:30,105 --> 00:42:30,965
Speaker 4:  Was a butler too.

880
00:42:31,235 --> 00:42:33,765
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Like a butler could go put like a, you know. Yeah.

881
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:35,125
Speaker 4:  Dog. Fancy dog. Yeah. Yeah.

882
00:42:35,445 --> 00:42:39,285
Speaker 3:  People have sent us pictures, cartoons. I encourage you to

883
00:42:39,345 --> 00:42:42,445
Speaker 3:  go ask an image generator to make a Bixby dog wearing shoes and send it to

884
00:42:42,445 --> 00:42:43,085
Speaker 3:  us. Long ears,

885
00:42:43,085 --> 00:42:43,485
Speaker 5:  Short ears.

886
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:47,525
Speaker 3:  Long long. Yeah, that's what I thought. This is a real floppy dog. Yeah,

887
00:42:47,525 --> 00:42:48,685
Speaker 5:  That's what I thought saying That's what I thought.

888
00:42:48,905 --> 00:42:49,965
Speaker 3:  Bix Bixby. Yeah,

889
00:42:51,805 --> 00:42:55,645
Speaker 3:  but If, you recall the original Bixby, the idea was that it would not compete

890
00:42:55,645 --> 00:42:59,445
Speaker 3:  with like Google Assistant to do go like web queries. It

891
00:42:59,445 --> 00:43:01,245
Speaker 3:  would change the settings on your phone,

892
00:43:01,375 --> 00:43:03,285
Speaker 4:  Right? It was designed to do stuff, never

893
00:43:03,285 --> 00:43:04,005
Speaker 5:  Did it. You're

894
00:43:04,005 --> 00:43:07,365
Speaker 3:  Like, yeah, never the, it was not a good butler. I mean, it was a dog.

895
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:11,925
Speaker 5:  Dogs aren't good butlers, what do we think we're doing? Inherently sucking

896
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:12,085
Speaker 5:  at it.

897
00:43:12,155 --> 00:43:15,805
Speaker 3:  What do we think we're doing here? But now they're saying we're working so

898
00:43:15,805 --> 00:43:19,645
Speaker 3:  hard to make it that. Which is fascinating because they still think

899
00:43:19,645 --> 00:43:20,885
Speaker 3:  that is a thing that people want.

900
00:43:21,445 --> 00:43:25,365
Speaker 4:  I think it is. I think like the idea

901
00:43:25,435 --> 00:43:28,965
Speaker 4:  that I can just yell at my phone to do something

902
00:43:29,635 --> 00:43:33,445
Speaker 4:  like go download the Ticketmaster app. Way

903
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:36,885
Speaker 4:  better user experience than what it actually currently takes to go download

904
00:43:36,885 --> 00:43:40,765
Speaker 4:  the Ticketmaster app. But it just, NELI has never really worked. But I think

905
00:43:40,765 --> 00:43:44,085
Speaker 4:  we're actually at a point with a lot of this AI stuff where like in that

906
00:43:44,085 --> 00:43:46,925
Speaker 4:  sort of limited scope of like things your phone is capable of doing,

907
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:51,205
Speaker 4:  have the system connect the dots for you that can work.

908
00:43:51,675 --> 00:43:55,565
Speaker 4:  Like, is, is it easier to say, turn on Bluetooth and look

909
00:43:55,565 --> 00:43:58,205
Speaker 4:  for this weird name of headphones that I have? Is that easier than going

910
00:43:58,205 --> 00:44:02,085
Speaker 4:  into the menu and hitting the thing? Like, probably not. But I think Samsung's

911
00:44:02,085 --> 00:44:06,045
Speaker 4:  idea that this is less about like, getting esoteric philosophical answers

912
00:44:06,045 --> 00:44:08,285
Speaker 4:  about the world and more about just like getting the stuff done that you

913
00:44:08,285 --> 00:44:10,085
Speaker 4:  do on your phone. Well it's, I think is

914
00:44:10,085 --> 00:44:13,285
Speaker 5:  Right. It's what we talked about earlier where it's it's customer support.

915
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:15,005
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Right. It basically

916
00:44:15,005 --> 00:44:17,685
Speaker 5:  Is. Yeah. It's, it's for people being like, I don't know how to turn Bluetooth

917
00:44:17,685 --> 00:44:21,645
Speaker 5:  on on my phone. How do I do it? Right. And Bixby will appear

918
00:44:22,025 --> 00:44:22,245
Speaker 5:  pan

919
00:44:22,365 --> 00:44:25,965
Speaker 4:  A little. Yeah. Like Bixby, my phone's in Portuguese. Fix that. Perfect.

920
00:44:26,435 --> 00:44:27,445
Speaker 5:  Open a gado. I was

921
00:44:27,445 --> 00:44:30,965
Speaker 3:  Gonna read you a quote from Juan June Choi, executive vice President of Mobile.

922
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,565
Speaker 3:  Mobile at Samsung. I believe we have to redefine the role of

923
00:44:34,735 --> 00:44:37,805
Speaker 3:  Bixby so that Bixby can be equipped with generative ai. To be smarter,

924
00:44:38,705 --> 00:44:41,565
Speaker 3:  you have to redefine Bix B's role. Well, not a butler anymore. Well, Bixby

925
00:44:41,565 --> 00:44:42,085
Speaker 3:  has to roll,

926
00:44:42,465 --> 00:44:43,325
Speaker 4:  Has to have a role.

927
00:44:45,415 --> 00:44:49,245
Speaker 3:  We'll see. But so Bixby exists on all of Samsung's other products. You could

928
00:44:49,245 --> 00:44:53,205
Speaker 3:  see how they build an old ecosystem. I dunno, man, I I,

929
00:44:53,365 --> 00:44:57,285
Speaker 3:  I feel like we're all racing to shove AI into these moments. And I

930
00:44:57,285 --> 00:45:00,765
Speaker 3:  think the phone companies are particularly afraid of the rabbits and the

931
00:45:00,765 --> 00:45:03,045
Speaker 3:  humanes and the blah blah blahs. You wrote a piece about this this week.

932
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:06,965
Speaker 3:  Like the AI gadgets are coming. Yeah. And I think you mentioned

933
00:45:06,965 --> 00:45:10,405
Speaker 3:  developer conferences. I'm confident we're gonna see a bunch of

934
00:45:10,785 --> 00:45:14,645
Speaker 3:  AI stuff in iOS at wwc. Google obviously at

935
00:45:14,665 --> 00:45:18,605
Speaker 3:  io is gonna talk about it a lot. I can't imagine they, Microsoft

936
00:45:18,605 --> 00:45:21,645
Speaker 3:  will talk about anything else that build and

937
00:45:21,645 --> 00:45:24,245
Speaker 4:  It's like, no, I mean, and the problem is all of these companies, there's

938
00:45:24,245 --> 00:45:27,765
Speaker 4:  basically like two sides of the world at this point, right? There's the companies

939
00:45:27,765 --> 00:45:31,085
Speaker 4:  that have done well in smartphones, which is three companies. It's Apple,

940
00:45:31,315 --> 00:45:35,165
Speaker 4:  it's Google, and it's Samsung. Those companies are desperate to figure out

941
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:39,005
Speaker 4:  an AI reason for your smartphone so that you will keep using

942
00:45:39,005 --> 00:45:41,805
Speaker 4:  your smartphone. Because what they're afraid of is that this new generation

943
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:44,685
Speaker 4:  of other companies is gonna come in and they're not going to have solved

944
00:45:45,025 --> 00:45:48,565
Speaker 4:  the whole problem immediately. But they're going to have fixed some part

945
00:45:48,565 --> 00:45:52,485
Speaker 4:  of the user experience that people are like, oh, this is the thing that gets

946
00:45:52,485 --> 00:45:56,405
Speaker 4:  me past my phone. And I think that's what I'm particularly looking

947
00:45:56,425 --> 00:45:59,325
Speaker 4:  for with what Humane is doing and what Rabbit is doing. And companies like

948
00:45:59,405 --> 00:46:01,765
Speaker 4:  Brilliant and even Meta with the smart glasses that are getting the ai, like,

949
00:46:02,265 --> 00:46:06,045
Speaker 4:  can they start to pull pieces of what I do on my phone, out of my phone?

950
00:46:06,665 --> 00:46:10,125
Speaker 4:  And if the answer is yes, that starts to kind of

951
00:46:10,625 --> 00:46:14,605
Speaker 4:  get in the way of this, like essentially three company ownership of the smartphone

952
00:46:14,885 --> 00:46:17,525
Speaker 4:  universe, at least in the us. And so it's not at all an accident that you

953
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:21,205
Speaker 4:  have Apple with Siri, Google with Gemini, and Samsung

954
00:46:21,275 --> 00:46:24,725
Speaker 4:  with Bixby, like desperately trying to figure out how to make your phone

955
00:46:25,025 --> 00:46:28,925
Speaker 4:  AI inside of the existing structure of phones, which is very hard to

956
00:46:28,925 --> 00:46:32,525
Speaker 4:  do because an AI that can do all the things I want it to do is

957
00:46:32,525 --> 00:46:35,965
Speaker 4:  literally not allowed in the way that phones exist right now. So it's gonna

958
00:46:35,965 --> 00:46:39,805
Speaker 4:  be fascinating. And so Apple is either gonna have to say like, oh, Siri can

959
00:46:39,865 --> 00:46:43,685
Speaker 4:  now go download apps for you and do stuff inside of those apps, and it has

960
00:46:43,685 --> 00:46:47,525
Speaker 4:  weird permission that nothing has ever had before. Or it's going to

961
00:46:47,635 --> 00:46:51,525
Speaker 4:  like protect this crazy revenue stream that is the app store at

962
00:46:51,525 --> 00:46:54,565
Speaker 4:  the risk of losing it all to gadgets that come up with a new way to do it.

963
00:46:54,795 --> 00:46:58,205
Speaker 4:  It's gonna be a really fun, like three months. Yeah. Pure chaos. Okay.

964
00:46:58,225 --> 00:47:01,285
Speaker 3:  I'm telling you, a year from now. Yeah, that's my prediction in the, in the

965
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:04,845
Speaker 3:  spring doldrums. I'm just like a year from now. Whole new internet. Yep.

966
00:47:05,025 --> 00:47:07,365
Speaker 3:  All right. We should take a break. We should come back. We have lightning

Speaker 3:  All right, we're back. Lightning around part two.

975
00:48:23,145 --> 00:48:24,195
Speaker 4:  This one's gonna be fast.

976
00:48:24,475 --> 00:48:28,195
Speaker 3:  We're gonna, David pointed out the first lightning round was almost an hour

977
00:48:28,195 --> 00:48:30,395
Speaker 3:  long. We talked about four things,

978
00:48:30,395 --> 00:48:31,355
Speaker 4:  Classic lightning round.

979
00:48:31,605 --> 00:48:34,115
Speaker 3:  We're just gonna go, we're gonna, this is my plan for this one. I'm just

980
00:48:34,115 --> 00:48:35,395
Speaker 3:  gonna read the headlines. Oh,

981
00:48:35,465 --> 00:48:35,755
Speaker 5:  Okay.

982
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,835
Speaker 3:  And then we're just gonna

983
00:48:36,945 --> 00:48:39,555
Speaker 4:  Alex now, just leave, just, it's fine.

984
00:48:39,985 --> 00:48:42,795
Speaker 3:  John Stewart's back on the Daily Show on, yep. Just on Mondays. I think

985
00:48:43,915 --> 00:48:47,755
Speaker 3:  he did a good segment on AI mostly being fake ads. And then

986
00:48:47,755 --> 00:48:50,355
Speaker 3:  he interviewed Lena Khan and basically

987
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:54,515
Speaker 3:  accused Apple of censoring his previous show on Apple. Yeah.

988
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:58,155
Speaker 5:  And this isn't the first time he's done that. That's the thing I like, that's

989
00:48:58,155 --> 00:49:01,875
Speaker 5:  what I wanted to talk about on the show, was like, what's going on with

990
00:49:02,035 --> 00:49:05,275
Speaker 5:  Apple and John Stewart? Because he keeps being like, Hey, apple

991
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:08,715
Speaker 5:  censored me more than once. It wouldn't let me talk about China. It wouldn't

992
00:49:08,715 --> 00:49:11,755
Speaker 5:  let me talk to Lena Khan. Like, it wouldn't let me do stupid

993
00:49:13,365 --> 00:49:17,235
Speaker 5:  pokes at technology. What's going on over at Apple? And that's a bad sign.

994
00:49:17,665 --> 00:49:17,955
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

995
00:49:18,515 --> 00:49:19,795
Speaker 3:  Although, what's did Apple think they were buying?

996
00:49:20,425 --> 00:49:21,795
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like everyone around that

997
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:24,795
Speaker 4:  I, I've wondered that too. Like, just don't make a deal with John Stewart.

998
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:29,115
Speaker 4:  It's like, it's fine. It's If you if that's, if that's how you feel, just

999
00:49:29,115 --> 00:49:31,235
Speaker 4:  don't have John Stewart like, I

1000
00:49:31,235 --> 00:49:33,915
Speaker 5:  Don't know. Well, that's what they eventually decided. Well, right. Yeah.

1001
00:49:33,975 --> 00:49:36,955
Speaker 4:  But I think about like, there, there was a thing Ryan Johnson said a few

1002
00:49:36,955 --> 00:49:40,195
Speaker 4:  years ago about how one of the sneaky things about Apple is they'll never

1003
00:49:40,195 --> 00:49:42,995
Speaker 4:  let the bad guy have an iPhone in a movie. You guys heard, you've heard that.

1004
00:49:42,995 --> 00:49:46,755
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And I, I think about that all the time as just sort

1005
00:49:46,755 --> 00:49:50,635
Speaker 4:  of like a silly quirk of Apple, right? And there's a lot of things going

1006
00:49:50,635 --> 00:49:54,515
Speaker 4:  on with how distribution works. And there's like, now Tom Cruise can

1007
00:49:54,515 --> 00:49:57,795
Speaker 4:  never be fighting an enemy with a name because it gets associated with a

1008
00:49:57,795 --> 00:50:00,915
Speaker 4:  country and the movie doesn't play in that country. So like, you can move

1009
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:04,875
Speaker 4:  around inside of this landscape in all kinds of weird ways. This one is just

1010
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:08,755
Speaker 4:  like, it just seems like it was a bad fit from the beginning. And

1011
00:50:08,795 --> 00:50:11,835
Speaker 4:  I also, I don't know John Stewart personally, but I get the distinct sense

1012
00:50:11,835 --> 00:50:14,995
Speaker 4:  that If, you make John Stewart a list of things he can't do. He's gonna then

1013
00:50:14,995 --> 00:50:18,755
Speaker 4:  attempt to go do every single one of them. Yeah. And so I feel like it's

1014
00:50:18,755 --> 00:50:22,355
Speaker 4:  almost a miracle that lasted this long with Apple. Yeah. But it was very

1015
00:50:22,355 --> 00:50:26,155
Speaker 4:  funny to hear him say to Lena Khan, I wanted to have you on my

1016
00:50:26,155 --> 00:50:27,285
Speaker 4:  show. And Apple said,

1017
00:50:27,785 --> 00:50:30,565
Speaker 3:  By the way, Lena Khan is the chair of the Federal Trade Commission, right?

1018
00:50:30,565 --> 00:50:33,685
Speaker 3:  Yep. She leads a lot of antitrust efforts, federal Trade Commission, not

1019
00:50:33,785 --> 00:50:37,205
Speaker 3:  the entity suing Apple for antitrust violations. That's the DOJ.

1020
00:50:37,625 --> 00:50:39,125
Speaker 3:  But she's the face of a lot of it.

1021
00:50:40,465 --> 00:50:43,685
Speaker 4:  She has a lot of feelings about antitrust in general. Yeah, yeah. A lot of,

1022
00:50:43,685 --> 00:50:44,445
Speaker 4:  lot of things. And I,

1023
00:50:44,445 --> 00:50:47,725
Speaker 3:  The tech companies all hate her. It's like a real thing. Yeah. But it's like

1024
00:50:47,725 --> 00:50:51,005
Speaker 3:  weird. Like I, I come back to this all the time. Same as you Alex, which

1025
00:50:51,005 --> 00:50:54,565
Speaker 3:  is like these tech companies, they want, they want to do media,

1026
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:58,285
Speaker 3:  and then they get one slice of what it's actually like to do media,

1027
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:01,845
Speaker 3:  which is just having to be okay with things. And they're like, no, thank

1028
00:51:01,845 --> 00:51:01,925
Speaker 3:  you.

1029
00:51:02,475 --> 00:51:05,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah. But I mean, they're, they're, we're seeing they're, they're increasing

1030
00:51:05,445 --> 00:51:08,965
Speaker 5:  their control in Hollywood. Like they, like Apple is doing pretty well.

1031
00:51:09,655 --> 00:51:13,245
Speaker 5:  Apple TV was the second most searched thing during the outage

1032
00:51:13,245 --> 00:51:16,965
Speaker 5:  yesterday. Like, like they, they have this power and, and is always,

1033
00:51:17,125 --> 00:51:21,085
Speaker 5:  I think, very uncomfortable for me to see any media organization, which Apple

1034
00:51:21,145 --> 00:51:25,085
Speaker 5:  now is saying, no, you can't cover something. And, and that's been the

1035
00:51:25,085 --> 00:51:28,885
Speaker 5:  way it's been always. Right? There's always been sensors at, at these companies

1036
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:31,765
Speaker 5:  saying, no, you can't talk about this. No, you can't talk about that. And

1037
00:51:31,785 --> 00:51:35,725
Speaker 5:  it felt like in the last, I don't know, 10, 15 years, those sensors, their

1038
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:39,485
Speaker 5:  power had really started to wane because we had these different ways of getting

1039
00:51:39,485 --> 00:51:43,365
Speaker 5:  this content to people. It wasn't just broadcast television, it was also,

1040
00:51:43,465 --> 00:51:46,685
Speaker 5:  it was the films, but it was also streaming, it was also cable, all these

1041
00:51:46,685 --> 00:51:50,325
Speaker 5:  other ways. And Apple came in and was like, yeah, network

1042
00:51:50,335 --> 00:51:51,285
Speaker 5:  censorship, huh.

1043
00:51:52,185 --> 00:51:52,605
Speaker 3:  That's

1044
00:51:52,675 --> 00:51:56,405
Speaker 5:  It's cool. And, and just brought it immediately back

1045
00:51:56,785 --> 00:52:00,645
Speaker 5:  and it makes sense. Sure. But the

1046
00:52:00,645 --> 00:52:04,325
Speaker 5:  last time they were doing it so that they didn't get sued by the

1047
00:52:04,505 --> 00:52:07,965
Speaker 5:  FCC, that's why we had network sensors for so long this time they're doing

1048
00:52:07,965 --> 00:52:11,925
Speaker 5:  it because Apple doesn't wanna upset people in China because it wants

1049
00:52:11,925 --> 00:52:15,245
Speaker 5:  to sell phones in China. And like the motivation is very, very different.

1050
00:52:15,245 --> 00:52:18,325
Speaker 5:  And I think that's what makes me the most uncomfortable here Yeah. Is that

1051
00:52:18,325 --> 00:52:22,045
Speaker 5:  like we're seeing a very large company exert its influence

1052
00:52:22,925 --> 00:52:26,445
Speaker 5:  directly on the things it owns. And then saying like,

1053
00:52:26,815 --> 00:52:30,565
Speaker 5:  we're doing it for very greedy capitalism reasons,

1054
00:52:30,655 --> 00:52:33,125
Speaker 5:  which is like, fine, that's your job. Your job is to make money. But also

1055
00:52:33,745 --> 00:52:36,925
Speaker 5:  if your job is to make money and your job is to create media,

1056
00:52:38,825 --> 00:52:42,805
Speaker 4:  But also If, you don't want someone talking about ai. Don't

1057
00:52:42,805 --> 00:52:45,645
Speaker 4:  hire that guy China. Don't hire John Stewart. Right. Yeah. That's kind of

1058
00:52:45,645 --> 00:52:48,525
Speaker 4:  where I'm at. Like, this is, the part about this I find so confusing is like,

1059
00:52:49,015 --> 00:52:52,085
Speaker 4:  there was the thing with Disney forever, right? Where Disney was reluctant

1060
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:56,005
Speaker 4:  to do something like ad Hulu to Disney Plus because this sort of family

1061
00:52:56,445 --> 00:53:00,405
Speaker 4:  friendly nature of a platform they call Disney was very

1062
00:53:00,405 --> 00:53:02,885
Speaker 4:  important to that company. And that has, I think, changed internally over

1063
00:53:02,885 --> 00:53:06,765
Speaker 4:  time. But like that's a stance you can hold. Yep.

1064
00:53:06,865 --> 00:53:10,565
Speaker 4:  If that's how you want to feel terrific, don't hire

1065
00:53:10,595 --> 00:53:14,485
Speaker 4:  John Stewart. And so, and so to me it's like the, the thing that I

1066
00:53:14,485 --> 00:53:18,125
Speaker 4:  find strange is not that Apple has these feelings, but that it really loudly

1067
00:53:18,125 --> 00:53:21,085
Speaker 4:  wants to pretend it doesn't have these feelings, and then

1068
00:53:22,155 --> 00:53:25,725
Speaker 4:  goes around just sort of quietly trying to steer everyone

1069
00:53:26,065 --> 00:53:29,245
Speaker 4:  in the direction that Apple would like, which is honestly Apple's whole mo

1070
00:53:29,245 --> 00:53:32,445
Speaker 4:  with everything all the time. Yeah. It's like Apple, apple prefers to be

1071
00:53:32,445 --> 00:53:36,205
Speaker 4:  sort of the wizard behind the curtain exerting influence without saying

1072
00:53:36,225 --> 00:53:37,765
Speaker 4:  or doing anything publicly. Right.

1073
00:53:37,795 --> 00:53:41,205
Speaker 3:  This is the closest Apple has gotten to like, news programming though. Like

1074
00:53:41,265 --> 00:53:44,805
Speaker 3:  I'm fine if Apple wants to make, if Apple wants to be a movie studio and

1075
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,805
Speaker 3:  it only makes heartwarming movies about uplifting, that's fine. Yeah. Great.

1076
00:53:47,805 --> 00:53:48,485
Speaker 3:  You're a great movie studio.

1077
00:53:48,515 --> 00:53:50,845
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Nobody's mad at the Hallmark channel for not doing like, hard hitting

1078
00:53:50,915 --> 00:53:51,205
Speaker 4:  news.

1079
00:53:51,345 --> 00:53:54,605
Speaker 3:  I'm furious The Hallmark channel every single day, sir.

1080
00:53:56,105 --> 00:53:58,445
Speaker 3:  But like hiring John Stewart is like, we're gonna do news, we're gonna be

1081
00:53:58,445 --> 00:54:02,325
Speaker 3:  topical, we're even relevant. And you just see most other big tech companies

1082
00:54:02,395 --> 00:54:05,565
Speaker 3:  have, they tried it and they're all running away from it as fast as like,

1083
00:54:05,565 --> 00:54:08,605
Speaker 3:  like Instagram threads, we don't want to do news. They're like, this is messy.

1084
00:54:08,715 --> 00:54:11,765
Speaker 3:  It's hard. It gets us in lots of trouble. It's not even what people want

1085
00:54:11,955 --> 00:54:15,525
Speaker 3:  Instagram threads. The algorithm is only gonna show you content about

1086
00:54:16,065 --> 00:54:19,725
Speaker 3:  how to be a tra wife so people can do engagement bait. And it's like, what's

1087
00:54:19,725 --> 00:54:23,285
Speaker 3:  happening here all day long? Right. And like, I think Apple

1088
00:54:23,545 --> 00:54:25,605
Speaker 3:  hasn't quite had that realization yet.

1089
00:54:26,155 --> 00:54:29,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I think that's true. But I, I think there's also just the, the concern

1090
00:54:29,445 --> 00:54:33,285
Speaker 5:  that if these are also the companies that are the primary owners

1091
00:54:33,305 --> 00:54:36,125
Speaker 5:  of how we view media Yeah. And they all don't wanna do news and they don't

1092
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:39,405
Speaker 5:  wanna like talk about serious issues all the time. Well, that's bad too.

1093
00:54:39,515 --> 00:54:42,045
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Take a, take a look around the media industry. Let's see how well this

1094
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:45,925
Speaker 3:  is going for everybody. Okay. That's that one. Speaking of Apple antitrust,

1095
00:54:46,665 --> 00:54:50,525
Speaker 3:  two things. One, the first European alternative app

1096
00:54:50,525 --> 00:54:54,245
Speaker 3:  stores have hit because of the DMA not the good one yet, which is alt store,

1097
00:54:54,245 --> 00:54:57,805
Speaker 3:  which is gonna have the emulators in it like an enterprise one has hit,

1098
00:54:57,895 --> 00:55:01,165
Speaker 3:  which is perfect. Yeah. Of course. Enterprise software was the first to

1099
00:55:01,165 --> 00:55:03,845
Speaker 4:  Go. Yeah. Would you like to jump through a bunch of hoops to download B2B

1100
00:55:03,845 --> 00:55:06,245
Speaker 4:  apps? Have we got a store for you?

1101
00:55:07,265 --> 00:55:10,405
Speaker 3:  But Kalin Booth, who's in Europe,

1102
00:55:11,385 --> 00:55:15,165
Speaker 3:  we hired them to like, look at this stuff. We have a good

1103
00:55:15,475 --> 00:55:17,885
Speaker 3:  deep look at it. There are a lot of hoops.

1104
00:55:18,345 --> 00:55:19,165
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah. Its

1105
00:55:19,165 --> 00:55:19,965
Speaker 3:  Intense. A lot of hoops.

1106
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:23,325
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Let me, let me just read this sentence to you. It made me laugh. Very

1107
00:55:23,325 --> 00:55:23,525
Speaker 4:  funny.

1108
00:55:25,305 --> 00:55:28,685
Speaker 4:  It goes like this. You begin by clicking a browser based link to load the

1109
00:55:28,685 --> 00:55:31,325
Speaker 4:  alternative store. From there you receive a popup informing you that your

1110
00:55:31,325 --> 00:55:34,325
Speaker 4:  installation settings don't allow marketplaces from that developer. Then

1111
00:55:34,325 --> 00:55:37,125
Speaker 4:  you head into settings, enable the marketplace, return to your browser, click

1112
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:40,165
Speaker 4:  the download link again, and received another prompt asking you to confirm

1113
00:55:40,165 --> 00:55:43,045
Speaker 4:  the install. Finally, you can open the store and browse the available apps.

1114
00:55:43,395 --> 00:55:44,405
Speaker 3:  Perfect. Whew.

1115
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:47,005
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I feel like I'd screw that up by accident. Like,

1116
00:55:47,115 --> 00:55:51,005
Speaker 3:  Yeah. So the argument is Apple doesn't know if it's things

1117
00:55:51,065 --> 00:55:54,805
Speaker 3:  are in compliance with the DMA until they release them. And the European

1118
00:55:54,805 --> 00:55:58,605
Speaker 3:  regulators tell them, which is weird, right? Like, if you're gonna be a

1119
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:01,445
Speaker 3:  regulator and you're going to insist that things are designed, you should

1120
00:56:01,445 --> 00:56:04,525
Speaker 3:  just say how you want them designed instead of this weird back and forth.

1121
00:56:05,265 --> 00:56:08,885
Speaker 3:  But I suspect all of this will change because the way it's designed is they

1122
00:56:09,085 --> 00:56:12,605
Speaker 3:  released it and then the European regulators are gonna be like, Al

1123
00:56:12,865 --> 00:56:14,245
Speaker 3:  and they're, they're gonna

1124
00:56:14,585 --> 00:56:15,005
Speaker 4:  As they do.

1125
00:56:15,035 --> 00:56:17,005
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And they're gonna say, this isn't good enough.

1126
00:56:17,445 --> 00:56:21,245
Speaker 4:  I think that's probably great. I also think I, I'm not terribly bothered

1127
00:56:21,425 --> 00:56:25,325
Speaker 4:  by making people jump through several hoops to do this, honestly. Like, I

1128
00:56:25,325 --> 00:56:28,845
Speaker 4:  think the, the thing on the Mac where If, you try to download

1129
00:56:29,145 --> 00:56:33,085
Speaker 4:  an app from a sort of non-trust source being like

1130
00:56:33,085 --> 00:56:37,045
Speaker 4:  the app store, it makes you open settings, find a thing, check

1131
00:56:37,045 --> 00:56:40,365
Speaker 4:  that box, and then go do it again. I think that is like the correct number

1132
00:56:40,365 --> 00:56:42,845
Speaker 4:  of hoops to jump through. Like, this is the sort of thing you should not

1133
00:56:42,845 --> 00:56:46,405
Speaker 4:  be able to do by accident. But If, you wanna do it, you should be able to

1134
00:56:46,405 --> 00:56:46,685
Speaker 4:  do it. Oh,

1135
00:56:46,925 --> 00:56:47,245
Speaker 5:  I disagree.

1136
00:56:47,245 --> 00:56:49,045
Speaker 4:  You should just know. You should have to know that you're doing it.

1137
00:56:49,325 --> 00:56:52,845
Speaker 5:  I, I wanna be able to absolutely destroy my phone on accident.

1138
00:56:53,645 --> 00:56:56,965
Speaker 5:  I like, I, that's how I learned how to compute and I wanna, I wanna maintain

1139
00:56:56,965 --> 00:57:00,845
Speaker 5:  that. And I think like kids today, that's, you know, kids today,

1140
00:57:01,025 --> 00:57:04,445
Speaker 5:  the kids today, they gotta learn too. Everybody's gotta learn how to like,

1141
00:57:04,445 --> 00:57:08,005
Speaker 5:  just destroy all of their technology 'cause they clicked one wrong box

1142
00:57:08,005 --> 00:57:11,805
Speaker 5:  somewhere. And it, it, it makes you, it makes you sharper. It makes you think

1143
00:57:11,805 --> 00:57:15,005
Speaker 5:  more. And we, we gotta, we gotta make people sharper and think it

1144
00:57:15,005 --> 00:57:15,285
Speaker 4:  More. I like it.

1145
00:57:15,285 --> 00:57:18,045
Speaker 3:  This is how we bring down a number of Iranian centrifuges. Yeah. It's just,

1146
00:57:18,475 --> 00:57:20,645
Speaker 3:  just let the worms proliferate. Yep.

1147
00:57:21,435 --> 00:57:22,605
Speaker 4:  Malware build character.

1148
00:57:22,845 --> 00:57:26,445
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Basically it does. Like, have you ever brought down an entire computer

1149
00:57:26,505 --> 00:57:30,365
Speaker 3:  lab trying to download one MP three? All right, now you're a real man.

1150
00:57:31,725 --> 00:57:34,165
Speaker 3:  I, I think there's a balance in there. 'cause Android has had this model

1151
00:57:35,225 --> 00:57:38,325
Speaker 3:  for a long time where you can like jump through some hoops and the argument

1152
00:57:38,385 --> 00:57:42,165
Speaker 3:  is like, I mean, we've seen it in the epic antitrust case against Google.

1153
00:57:42,165 --> 00:57:44,405
Speaker 3:  Like Google knew that people weren't doing it 'cause the hoops were there.

1154
00:57:44,405 --> 00:57:48,365
Speaker 3:  Right. But then you kind of don't want a bunch of people accidentally screwing

1155
00:57:48,365 --> 00:57:51,085
Speaker 3:  things up. The thing that's really interesting though is

1156
00:57:52,325 --> 00:57:55,965
Speaker 3:  Alt Store has Delta in it, which is a Nintendo emulator, by all accounts,

1157
00:57:56,045 --> 00:57:58,925
Speaker 3:  a great emulator. Apple won't allow that on its stores.

1158
00:58:00,025 --> 00:58:02,525
Speaker 3:  But now you're like, oh, there's an entire use case for the iPhone that's

1159
00:58:02,525 --> 00:58:05,045
Speaker 3:  available to me now. Right. Because there's an alternative application distribution

1160
00:58:05,045 --> 00:58:07,005
Speaker 3:  model that's worth it.

1161
00:58:07,345 --> 00:58:07,925
Speaker 4:  Oh, agreed.

1162
00:58:08,045 --> 00:58:08,965
Speaker 5:  A hundred percent agreed.

1163
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:12,445
Speaker 4:  And I think it, it is, it's kind of great that, that it, the first

1164
00:58:12,815 --> 00:58:16,565
Speaker 4:  thing, because like, leaving aside all the legality questions about

1165
00:58:16,885 --> 00:58:20,245
Speaker 4:  emulation in general, like whatever, playing those kinds of games on your

1166
00:58:20,245 --> 00:58:24,005
Speaker 4:  phone is so fun. It's so fun. And it, and

1167
00:58:24,005 --> 00:58:26,525
Speaker 4:  you're right that it has not been allowed and it's never going to be allowed.

1168
00:58:26,525 --> 00:58:30,365
Speaker 4:  And there was a minute where Ry tested the developer thought he was

1169
00:58:30,365 --> 00:58:33,965
Speaker 4:  gonna get into the app store proper and then got that sort of

1170
00:58:34,025 --> 00:58:36,845
Speaker 4:  ripped out from under him. This is a couple of years ago now. Yeah.

1171
00:58:38,065 --> 00:58:42,005
Speaker 4:  But now we're at a point where, like, If, you want to

1172
00:58:42,005 --> 00:58:44,965
Speaker 4:  go through the hoops, you are going to be able to get your phone to do almost

1173
00:58:45,245 --> 00:58:47,885
Speaker 4:  anything. And I think that is the right approach. Yeah. I think it should

1174
00:58:47,885 --> 00:58:51,845
Speaker 4:  be hard work to do the dumb stuff you want to do on your

1175
00:58:51,845 --> 00:58:55,085
Speaker 4:  phone. Like, I think it should be more than one click of one link to download

1176
00:58:55,085 --> 00:58:58,005
Speaker 4:  malware onto your phone. But damnit If, you wanna download malware onto your

1177
00:58:58,005 --> 00:58:58,125
Speaker 4:  phone,

1178
00:58:58,405 --> 00:58:58,925
Speaker 5:  You should be allowed.

1179
00:58:59,385 --> 00:59:03,205
Speaker 4:  You should be allowed. And I think that's fine. And I think it is gonna be

1180
00:59:03,365 --> 00:59:07,285
Speaker 4:  interesting to see from a regulatory perspective how they view the hoops.

1181
00:59:08,125 --> 00:59:12,085
Speaker 4:  Because I think if, if the goal of the EU and the

1182
00:59:12,085 --> 00:59:15,965
Speaker 4:  regulators in general is to make it so sort of like

1183
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:19,245
Speaker 4:  opaque in the process, that it feels like you're downloading an app from

1184
00:59:19,245 --> 00:59:21,605
Speaker 4:  the app store, even when you're not, I actually think, think that's a bad

1185
00:59:21,605 --> 00:59:25,565
Speaker 4:  outcome. But I also feel like the thing where you have to go

1186
00:59:25,565 --> 00:59:28,965
Speaker 4:  essentially check the one box that declares the, like, I know what I'm doing

1187
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:32,045
Speaker 4:  and I'm willing to put up the consequences and then you can move on with

1188
00:59:32,045 --> 00:59:35,405
Speaker 4:  your life feels right to me. And this feels like a little overshoot of that.

1189
00:59:35,555 --> 00:59:36,125
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah.

1190
00:59:36,295 --> 00:59:39,405
Speaker 3:  We'll see how it goes. I'm very excited. I mean, this is the experiment.

1191
00:59:39,565 --> 00:59:43,365
Speaker 3:  We're, we've never run it before. Like, we'll see how it goes. I,

1192
00:59:43,485 --> 00:59:46,205
Speaker 3:  I, I think there's something really exciting to happen here. I agree. David,

1193
00:59:46,345 --> 00:59:50,245
Speaker 3:  you've added this extremely fake story about Stephen and buying TikTok

1194
00:59:50,245 --> 00:59:53,525
Speaker 3:  without the algorithm. Defend yourself, defend the addition of this. This

1195
00:59:53,525 --> 00:59:55,165
Speaker 3:  is a totally fake story. This matter.

1196
00:59:55,195 --> 00:59:58,605
Speaker 4:  It's a totally fake story. Well, this is why I added it because, so we, we

1197
00:59:58,605 --> 01:00:01,885
Speaker 4:  got a ton of feedback over the last couple of weeks about both the Apple

1198
01:00:01,885 --> 01:00:05,245
Speaker 4:  antitrust stuff and the TikTok ban. And we're gonna talk about all that stuff

1199
01:00:05,245 --> 01:00:09,205
Speaker 4:  on Tuesday's episode. But for this one, my real question

1200
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:12,885
Speaker 4:  is more theoretical than this. Like Steve Uchin is not going to buy TikTok

1201
01:00:13,425 --> 01:00:15,605
Speaker 4:  buying TikTok with the, without the algorithm that not

1202
01:00:15,605 --> 01:00:17,885
Speaker 3:  By the A thing, by way, he's the former treasury secretary under Trump.

1203
01:00:17,955 --> 01:00:21,045
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Who is not going to buy TikTok, doesn't matter who he is, he is not

1204
01:00:21,045 --> 01:00:24,925
Speaker 4:  gonna buy TikTok. And I think I'm

1205
01:00:24,925 --> 01:00:27,685
Speaker 4:  just fascinated by this question. So there are two pieces of news here that

1206
01:00:27,685 --> 01:00:31,565
Speaker 4:  I think are, are related. So one is that Facebook this week rolled out a

1207
01:00:31,565 --> 01:00:35,445
Speaker 4:  unified video player for all of its video across platforms. And

1208
01:00:35,475 --> 01:00:38,885
Speaker 4:  it's basically all in on precisely TikTok style

1209
01:00:39,605 --> 01:00:43,485
Speaker 4:  vertical video. And that plus this thing where it's like,

1210
01:00:43,485 --> 01:00:47,285
Speaker 4:  okay, what do you buy If? you buy TikTok without the algorithm just

1211
01:00:47,285 --> 01:00:50,085
Speaker 4:  led me to believe like, maybe, maybe the answer is nothing like

1212
01:00:51,825 --> 01:00:55,765
Speaker 4:  buying TikTok without, without the algorithm. It's garbage. Is that

1213
01:00:55,965 --> 01:00:58,325
Speaker 4:  anything? But then we're at a point where TikTok has actually gotten more

1214
01:00:58,325 --> 01:01:01,485
Speaker 4:  and more transparent about what the algorithm is. And so in theory,

1215
01:01:02,145 --> 01:01:05,965
Speaker 4:  you could start to do better and companies like Meta have been more explicit

1216
01:01:05,965 --> 01:01:09,245
Speaker 4:  about like, we're not going to, you know, show you stuff from your friends.

1217
01:01:09,245 --> 01:01:12,885
Speaker 4:  We're not going to buy us anything except engagement and entertainment

1218
01:01:12,885 --> 01:01:15,365
Speaker 4:  essentially. So it's like you can actually start to kind of reverse engineer

1219
01:01:15,425 --> 01:01:19,165
Speaker 4:  TikTok and without this magical algorithm

1220
01:01:19,195 --> 01:01:23,165
Speaker 4:  that is so much of what TikTok has become, you're just buying

1221
01:01:23,365 --> 01:01:26,605
Speaker 4:  a brand name, right? Like you're buying, you're buying a license to the word

1222
01:01:26,605 --> 01:01:29,805
Speaker 4:  TikTok. And that's well and good, but TikTok without the algorithm feels

1223
01:01:29,805 --> 01:01:33,605
Speaker 4:  like, to me it's worth like $5. Yeah, I think that's right. I just

1224
01:01:33,605 --> 01:01:37,045
Speaker 4:  don't see it. And I think it, it that if that's going to become

1225
01:01:38,185 --> 01:01:41,725
Speaker 4:  the question, and I think so far our theory, which is that this is going

1226
01:01:41,725 --> 01:01:45,245
Speaker 4:  to lead to nothing has pretty much borne out. We've basically heard nothing

1227
01:01:45,245 --> 01:01:48,365
Speaker 4:  about this since there was all that stuff a couple of weeks ago. I hope he

1228
01:01:48,365 --> 01:01:48,485
Speaker 3:  Does

1229
01:01:48,485 --> 01:01:51,405
Speaker 5:  That. I hope, like right now as we're recording, oh my God,

1230
01:01:51,915 --> 01:01:54,965
Speaker 3:  Signing on the top. I think Voice of the Youth. I think of former treasury

1231
01:01:55,325 --> 01:01:59,085
Speaker 3:  secretary Steve Chen. Well, you get all the content, he'd buy all the content,

1232
01:01:59,585 --> 01:02:03,165
Speaker 3:  and then you just put any algorithm on top of it and you're fine. Sure.

1233
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:06,485
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I mean that's what you, that's what you'd be buying. You'd be buying

1234
01:02:06,585 --> 01:02:09,005
Speaker 3:  all the user generated content that is TikTok.

1235
01:02:09,765 --> 01:02:11,005
Speaker 4:  I guess that's true. That's,

1236
01:02:11,005 --> 01:02:11,525
Speaker 3:  That's, that's a thing.

1237
01:02:11,525 --> 01:02:14,165
Speaker 4:  But also all of that content now exists on all the other platforms too.

1238
01:02:14,165 --> 01:02:15,285
Speaker 3:  That's true. That's, so

1239
01:02:15,285 --> 01:02:18,645
Speaker 4:  That's kind of where I'm at, right? Like if I'm, if I'm the Instagram team,

1240
01:02:19,785 --> 01:02:23,645
Speaker 4:  I'm, I'm having meetings where it's like, what does TikTok have

1241
01:02:23,785 --> 01:02:27,685
Speaker 4:  and offer at this moment that we can't? And like the, the YouTube

1242
01:02:27,685 --> 01:02:30,325
Speaker 4:  Schwarz team I know is asking that same kind of question. Like I know what

1243
01:02:30,325 --> 01:02:32,565
Speaker 4:  it's, it's all just sitting there. And especially If, you don't have the

1244
01:02:32,565 --> 01:02:36,045
Speaker 4:  algorithm. And the algorithm has been made out to be this like, magical

1245
01:02:36,975 --> 01:02:40,805
Speaker 4:  thing that is irreparable and perfect and understands people better

1246
01:02:40,805 --> 01:02:44,125
Speaker 4:  than they do themselves. I don't know that it's that, I think part of it

1247
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:47,725
Speaker 4:  is just that like, TikTok is so shameless about the way that it works. And

1248
01:02:48,155 --> 01:02:51,885
Speaker 4:  like Adam er, who runs Instagram is like ringing his hands trying to be a

1249
01:02:51,885 --> 01:02:54,525
Speaker 4:  good person. And TikTok is just like, TikTok shop, let's go.

1250
01:02:54,825 --> 01:02:57,285
Speaker 3:  TikTok is doing the thing. It's happened for you. I think they're testing

1251
01:02:57,285 --> 01:02:59,925
Speaker 3:  this. It's definitely happening to me where they just start playing an ad

1252
01:03:00,145 --> 01:03:01,885
Speaker 3:  at the end of every video now. Oh

1253
01:03:01,905 --> 01:03:02,805
Speaker 4:  No, I have not

1254
01:03:02,805 --> 01:03:05,365
Speaker 3:  Gotten that. No. So you're like, you instead of looping, it's just like,

1255
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:09,245
Speaker 3:  here's an ad. And all of those ads for me are for

1256
01:03:09,245 --> 01:03:13,005
Speaker 3:  the Land Rover defender, which is utterly confusing.

1257
01:03:13,995 --> 01:03:17,805
Speaker 3:  Like that algorithm believes that it can get me to buy a Land Rover

1258
01:03:18,045 --> 01:03:21,525
Speaker 3:  defender. And all the ads start with the same sweeping shot of the word defender.

1259
01:03:22,425 --> 01:03:25,325
Speaker 3:  So it's like, I never know if it's just like some weird it security company.

1260
01:03:25,345 --> 01:03:26,885
Speaker 3:  No, it's the Land Rover Defender. That's what

1261
01:03:26,885 --> 01:03:27,445
Speaker 5:  It is. Yep. There it is.

1262
01:03:27,535 --> 01:03:31,245
Speaker 3:  There it is again. Definitely not buying a Land Rover Defender's pretty good

1263
01:03:31,245 --> 01:03:34,125
Speaker 3:  though. Yeah. It's just like, but they've started doing it. Like they're,

1264
01:03:34,385 --> 01:03:37,165
Speaker 3:  the platform is getting, they're squeezing more pennies out of it, right?

1265
01:03:37,165 --> 01:03:39,365
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Because it might go away or something might happen. I feel like

1266
01:03:39,365 --> 01:03:43,285
Speaker 5:  The, the algorithm's also just getting worse. Like,

1267
01:03:43,505 --> 01:03:47,125
Speaker 5:  it keeps showing me this guy going, what's up brother doing this? Yes.

1268
01:03:47,235 --> 01:03:51,205
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. I I am not a sports person. I I don't play

1269
01:03:51,205 --> 01:03:52,125
Speaker 5:  Madden. You

1270
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:52,525
Speaker 4:  Were talking about

1271
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:55,085
Speaker 5:  You guys immediately were like, yeah, yeah, we Of course. Maybe

1272
01:03:55,085 --> 01:03:56,365
Speaker 4:  That's why like this on his, on his,

1273
01:03:56,795 --> 01:03:59,325
Speaker 5:  It's good. Yeah, I know that now because TikTok shown me that

1274
01:04:00,005 --> 01:04:03,325
Speaker 3:  Repeatedly. There's not TikTok just made a weird Twitch streamer. A star

1275
01:04:03,345 --> 01:04:06,085
Speaker 3:  is like very interesting. It's super weird. All right, mark this down. That's

1276
01:04:06,085 --> 01:04:09,405
Speaker 3:  a story. We'll come back to this in Microsoft, but this story solely fake.

1277
01:04:09,555 --> 01:04:13,445
Speaker 3:  This dude is not buying TikTok. No, no. Last two little regulatory ones.

1278
01:04:14,005 --> 01:04:16,885
Speaker 3:  I think it's very funny that the House of Representatives has now banned

1279
01:04:16,985 --> 01:04:20,165
Speaker 3:  its staffers from using Microsoft Copilot because they're putting too much

1280
01:04:20,165 --> 01:04:23,685
Speaker 3:  data into an insecure LLM system. Very funny. Yep.

1281
01:04:23,995 --> 01:04:27,925
Speaker 3:  Just deeply funny. And then we'll come back to this in more

1282
01:04:28,145 --> 01:04:30,165
Speaker 3:  detail, but

1283
01:04:31,705 --> 01:04:35,645
Speaker 3:  the FCC has scheduled a vote to restore net neutrality, which is very

1284
01:04:35,845 --> 01:04:39,685
Speaker 3:  interesting. It feels like we've already

1285
01:04:39,685 --> 01:04:42,965
Speaker 3:  ruined enough things. you know, it's like, it's like hard for anyone to get

1286
01:04:42,965 --> 01:04:46,845
Speaker 3:  excited about this. It's like, I'm thrilled we did it. Like, because they

1287
01:04:46,845 --> 01:04:50,645
Speaker 3:  took net neutrality away. I I just want to, there are people

1288
01:04:50,645 --> 01:04:52,885
Speaker 3:  out there who are like, nothing bad happened when net neutrality went away

1289
01:04:53,145 --> 01:04:56,925
Speaker 3:  and one very specific bad thing happened, which is that

1290
01:04:56,945 --> 01:04:58,605
Speaker 3:  at t bought Time Warner,

1291
01:05:00,675 --> 01:05:04,525
Speaker 3:  like very specific bad thing happened and they thought

1292
01:05:04,525 --> 01:05:07,605
Speaker 3:  they could prioritize Time Warner services on at t's network.

1293
01:05:09,265 --> 01:05:12,845
Speaker 3:  And then they paid Zach Snyder to make a four three gray scale version

1294
01:05:13,345 --> 01:05:14,325
Speaker 3:  of the Justice League.

1295
01:05:14,595 --> 01:05:18,485
Speaker 4:  Alex did Bat Girl Die because Net neutrality died. Yeah. Could

1296
01:05:18,485 --> 01:05:19,885
Speaker 4:  you draw? I feel like you could draw that

1297
01:05:19,885 --> 01:05:21,005
Speaker 5:  Line. I think. I think you can.

1298
01:05:21,005 --> 01:05:23,485
Speaker 4:  Because without that acquisition, they don't have all the debt when they

1299
01:05:23,485 --> 01:05:27,245
Speaker 4:  get offloaded, which means Zav doesn't have to kill Bat Girl. Yeah, yeah,

1300
01:05:27,275 --> 01:05:29,125
Speaker 4:  yeah. That's thanks to Jeep Pie. He ruined

1301
01:05:29,145 --> 01:05:31,925
Speaker 3:  Bat Girl. I'm believe it. I'm just saying this man in his stupid mug, his

1302
01:05:31,925 --> 01:05:35,165
Speaker 3:  stupid oversized Reese's Pieces mug. And everyone's like, no bad things happen.

1303
01:05:35,385 --> 01:05:39,365
Speaker 3:  And it's like, actually one very tangible bad thing happened,

1304
01:05:39,535 --> 01:05:43,405
Speaker 3:  which is at t had a theory of the case. It was like, we will buy a content

1305
01:05:43,405 --> 01:05:47,205
Speaker 3:  service, prioritize it, and preload tiny little

1306
01:05:47,255 --> 01:05:50,325
Speaker 3:  clips of Game of Thrones on mid-range and Android phones. Wait and accept

1307
01:05:50,345 --> 01:05:54,205
Speaker 3:  all of that from our data caps. This was, this was it.

1308
01:05:55,105 --> 01:05:58,165
Speaker 3:  And then we're gonna get Zach Snyder for some

1309
01:05:58,435 --> 01:06:02,365
Speaker 3:  godforsaken reason. I know he thought it was the IMAX I aspect ratio.

1310
01:06:02,475 --> 01:06:06,445
Speaker 3:  Okay. I know that's what he was thinking. But the reality is

1311
01:06:06,445 --> 01:06:10,245
Speaker 3:  he made a four three version of Justice League. That's how I watched it on

1312
01:06:10,245 --> 01:06:11,605
Speaker 3:  my tv. It was a square.

1313
01:06:13,185 --> 01:06:13,885
Speaker 3:  I'm just Why

1314
01:06:14,705 --> 01:06:18,125
Speaker 5:  You, the more you say it, the more I feel like what if net neutrality, like,

1315
01:06:18,555 --> 01:06:22,285
Speaker 5:  like actually that was a good thing that that at t was allowed

1316
01:06:22,285 --> 01:06:23,365
Speaker 3:  To, we got four three Justice leave.

1317
01:06:23,475 --> 01:06:26,645
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Because it proved that like no one wants that.

1318
01:06:27,385 --> 01:06:30,205
Speaker 3:  It does prove I will. I agree with you. Yeah. I actually agree. The market

1319
01:06:31,065 --> 01:06:34,765
Speaker 3:  firmly rejected at T'S ideas. Correct. It was like, no, this is

1320
01:06:34,765 --> 01:06:38,565
Speaker 3:  stupid. But we didn't need to go through all that pain. We didn't need to

1321
01:06:38,565 --> 01:06:42,245
Speaker 3:  fire all those people. We like the layoffs that occurred.

1322
01:06:42,425 --> 01:06:45,205
Speaker 3:  The, the, the, the general pain.

1323
01:06:46,165 --> 01:06:46,525
Speaker 5:  Thousands of people

1324
01:06:46,725 --> 01:06:48,885
Speaker 3:  Affected lobbed upon the American populace

1325
01:06:49,955 --> 01:06:52,245
Speaker 5:  With black and white Zack Snyder, justice

1326
01:06:52,245 --> 01:06:56,045
Speaker 3:  League four, three Justice League was created. Like, we

1327
01:06:56,045 --> 01:06:58,365
Speaker 3:  didn't have to, you know, I'm saying like, I think the layoffs were worse.

1328
01:06:58,365 --> 01:07:02,285
Speaker 3:  Like the millions of the millions of dollars of like debt and weirdness

1329
01:07:02,345 --> 01:07:02,565
Speaker 3:  and,

1330
01:07:02,945 --> 01:07:05,325
Speaker 5:  But we all experienced Zack Snyder movie

1331
01:07:05,465 --> 01:07:08,565
Speaker 3:  Rounds of rolling layoffs are bad. I don't think we need to do them. We should

1332
01:07:08,565 --> 01:07:11,965
Speaker 3:  have healthy companies in a functional marketplace. But then also

1333
01:07:12,575 --> 01:07:14,205
Speaker 3:  there was a four three Justice League

1334
01:07:16,635 --> 01:07:18,165
Speaker 3:  also very tangible results. We

1335
01:07:18,165 --> 01:07:18,485
Speaker 5:  Had to watch it

1336
01:07:18,515 --> 01:07:21,685
Speaker 3:  Results. I watched all like 15 hours of it.

1337
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:23,045
Speaker 5:  You had to do it as a journalist. Like,

1338
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:26,485
Speaker 3:  And the only thing that saved me is because I invest in OLED technology.

1339
01:07:26,825 --> 01:07:30,685
Speaker 3:  Oh my God. The, the pillar boxes weren't shining great. They was so bad.

1340
01:07:32,185 --> 01:07:32,965
Speaker 4:  How was your bit rate

1341
01:07:34,485 --> 01:07:38,365
Speaker 3:  Horrible. ACM X is a garbage bit rate. Get

1342
01:07:38,365 --> 01:07:42,245
Speaker 3:  that shit on Bravia Court asap. And excuse that from your data

1343
01:07:42,395 --> 01:07:43,245
Speaker 3:  caps. At and t

1344
01:07:46,185 --> 01:07:49,725
Speaker 3:  I'm just saying whenever anyone tells you, whenever you see the, the weirdos

1345
01:07:49,745 --> 01:07:52,765
Speaker 3:  on the, on the X being like net neutrality led to nothing.

1346
01:07:54,275 --> 01:07:57,445
Speaker 3:  Immediately reply with a screenshot of four three, justice League and Grace.

1347
01:07:57,765 --> 01:08:01,725
Speaker 5:  I feel like the Venn diagram of weirdos on X

1348
01:08:01,785 --> 01:08:05,645
Speaker 5:  saying net neutrality, net led to nothing. And

1349
01:08:06,145 --> 01:08:09,765
Speaker 5:  the people who really wanted that four, three movies, the circle,

1350
01:08:13,275 --> 01:08:16,645
Speaker 3:  It's just like they couldn't even, they weren't even like just fill, make

1351
01:08:16,645 --> 01:08:19,605
Speaker 3:  it 16. Like just do it. No IMAX enhanced, right?

1352
01:08:20,225 --> 01:08:24,125
Speaker 5:  Huh? Because we all have those in our house. You don't have an IMAX screen

1353
01:08:24,125 --> 01:08:25,005
Speaker 5:  in your house. All that

1354
01:08:25,205 --> 01:08:28,805
Speaker 3:  OLED you can get. I, I do like that IMAX enhanced is basically meant we,

1355
01:08:28,825 --> 01:08:32,645
Speaker 3:  we took a 21 9 cinema frame and made it 16 by nine. It's just regular

1356
01:08:32,705 --> 01:08:36,525
Speaker 3:  now. It's just regular, like Disney. Disney Plus is like IMAX enhanced.

1357
01:08:36,525 --> 01:08:39,765
Speaker 3:  Like what does that mean? It's, it's 16 by nine. Yeah. That's like, that's

1358
01:08:39,765 --> 01:08:43,325
Speaker 3:  what that has worked out to. It's great. Alright. That

1359
01:08:43,475 --> 01:08:47,165
Speaker 3:  vote is coming up. We'll probably have Lauren back to cover in more detail

1360
01:08:47,555 --> 01:08:50,925
Speaker 3:  what it actually means. There's some meaningful differences between this

1361
01:08:50,925 --> 01:08:54,285
Speaker 3:  version in previous versions. I just wanna point out that again,

1362
01:08:55,025 --> 01:08:58,445
Speaker 3:  you live in an America right now in 2024 where

1363
01:08:59,245 --> 01:09:03,125
Speaker 3:  Backroll was killed. David lov, can't believe it. Reign of

1364
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:06,965
Speaker 3:  Terror continues. We're down to three wireless carriers and Project

1365
01:09:07,105 --> 01:09:07,925
Speaker 3:  Gen five sis

1366
01:09:09,865 --> 01:09:11,325
Speaker 4:  All because of the stupid mug.

1367
01:09:13,075 --> 01:09:16,765
Speaker 3:  It's a real thing. There's no, by the way, at the same time the same

1368
01:09:17,185 --> 01:09:21,045
Speaker 3:  Jit pa, FCC got rid of the privacy protections

1369
01:09:21,105 --> 01:09:24,005
Speaker 3:  for broadband carriers and any ability to regulate them all.

1370
01:09:24,775 --> 01:09:27,765
Speaker 3:  These aren't our favorite companies. The ISPs, I should note at this time

1371
01:09:28,475 --> 01:09:32,405
Speaker 3:  that NB NBCUniversal is a minority investor in Vox Media, which owns The.

1372
01:09:32,485 --> 01:09:35,965
Speaker 3:  Verge, and NBCUniversal is owned by Comcast. Right. Which does not love net

1373
01:09:35,965 --> 01:09:38,485
Speaker 3:  neutrality. Or me as it happens.

1374
01:09:39,285 --> 01:09:41,005
Speaker 5:  I subscribe to Verizon. It's okay.

1375
01:09:41,555 --> 01:09:43,405
Speaker 3:  Yeah. IIIF It's nice. Yeah.

1376
01:09:44,115 --> 01:09:44,525
Speaker 5:  It's okay.

1377
01:09:44,745 --> 01:09:48,445
Speaker 3:  I'm an at t subscriber. I stream Justice League for free. Oh wow.

1378
01:09:48,515 --> 01:09:51,805
Speaker 3:  That was that. It didn't hit my data cap at all. Congratulations.

1379
01:09:52,275 --> 01:09:52,565
Speaker 4:  It's

1380
01:09:52,565 --> 01:09:56,365
Speaker 3:  Big for you. My at t subscription still locked into Max. And

1381
01:09:56,365 --> 01:09:59,725
Speaker 3:  so now I only have Max and 10 80 B. That's very good.

1382
01:10:00,585 --> 01:10:01,125
Speaker 3:  All right. We gotta

1383
01:11:14,415 --> 01:11:18,405
Speaker 3:  Right. So Tesla's deliveries are weighed down under forecast.

1384
01:11:19,635 --> 01:11:23,325
Speaker 3:  I've NELI, I've never seen it before, but various investors and

1385
01:11:24,055 --> 01:11:27,565
Speaker 3:  executives are talking about replacing Elon as ceo. That will probably never

1386
01:11:27,565 --> 01:11:31,325
Speaker 3:  happen. But even the fact that it is a conversation that has occurred,

1387
01:11:32,115 --> 01:11:33,885
Speaker 3:  like in the CNBC orbits,

1388
01:11:34,465 --> 01:11:35,245
Speaker 5:  The shine is off,

1389
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:38,365
Speaker 3:  Seems very bad. Tesla stock is generally tanking. Yep.

1390
01:11:39,235 --> 01:11:42,925
Speaker 3:  Elon is just tweeting about the woke mind virus instead of shipping more

1391
01:11:42,925 --> 01:11:46,165
Speaker 3:  cars or making X Good. It's not great over there. No,

1392
01:11:46,905 --> 01:11:50,485
Speaker 4:  No. I think there was a thing about

1393
01:11:50,655 --> 01:11:54,525
Speaker 4:  Tesla that made him kind of invincible for a really long time because it

1394
01:11:54,525 --> 01:11:57,925
Speaker 4:  was like the, the conversation around Elon for so long was like,

1395
01:11:58,305 --> 01:12:02,205
Speaker 4:  say whatever you want. People are voting with their dollars. Right? Like

1396
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:06,365
Speaker 4:  Tesla was on fire, investors loved it. People were buying it.

1397
01:12:06,425 --> 01:12:09,205
Speaker 4:  We talked on their show about how there was essentially unlimited demand

1398
01:12:09,205 --> 01:12:13,045
Speaker 4:  for Teslas. And at some point in

1399
01:12:13,045 --> 01:12:16,845
Speaker 4:  the last year or so that turned, and I think you can probably blame that

1400
01:12:16,845 --> 01:12:20,645
Speaker 4:  on a confluence of things. Not all of it is. A lot of people decided

1401
01:12:20,645 --> 01:12:23,005
Speaker 4:  they don't like Elon Musk anymore. But I think I had some of it is that,

1402
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:26,885
Speaker 4:  but like this sort of era of

1403
01:12:27,855 --> 01:12:31,805
Speaker 4:  power that Tesla had for a long time seems

1404
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:35,685
Speaker 4:  pretty clearly to be, if not over them, under like really serious

1405
01:12:35,745 --> 01:12:39,645
Speaker 4:  threat. And as we've been saying, and I think as you in particular, NELI

1406
01:12:39,645 --> 01:12:43,525
Speaker 4:  have said a few times on this show, Tesla is both

1407
01:12:43,595 --> 01:12:47,005
Speaker 4:  like a great strength and a great weakness for Elon because of the way it

1408
01:12:47,045 --> 01:12:50,845
Speaker 4:  ties him to China, because of the way it like has all of his

1409
01:12:50,845 --> 01:12:54,725
Speaker 4:  fortunes inside of it. That like what happens to this company is

1410
01:12:54,865 --> 01:12:58,125
Speaker 4:  so materially important to what happens to everything else that Elon Musk

1411
01:12:58,125 --> 01:13:01,925
Speaker 4:  wants to do, including the way that SpaceX works with the government. Like

1412
01:13:02,115 --> 01:13:06,045
Speaker 4:  it's all so tied up. And so you get the sense that as it

1413
01:13:06,045 --> 01:13:09,965
Speaker 4:  is starting to turn the other way, it like it, the spiral happens

1414
01:13:10,345 --> 01:13:13,645
Speaker 4:  in the reverse direction too. Yeah. Yep. And it feels like it's getting really

1415
01:13:13,645 --> 01:13:14,325
Speaker 4:  ugly really fast.

1416
01:13:14,545 --> 01:13:17,845
Speaker 3:  So we have a story this week. There's a reputation tracking firm called Caliber.

1417
01:13:18,305 --> 01:13:22,005
Speaker 3:  We went, surveyed a bunch of people, the consideration score

1418
01:13:22,105 --> 01:13:25,805
Speaker 3:  for Tesla, which is basically consumer interest in brands. The

1419
01:13:26,005 --> 01:13:29,285
Speaker 3:  question they went and surveyed people I would buy or continue buying products

1420
01:13:29,285 --> 01:13:32,365
Speaker 3:  and services from Tesla if given the chance in

1421
01:13:32,605 --> 01:13:36,125
Speaker 3:  November, 2021, 70% of people said yes, that's down to

1422
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:37,165
Speaker 3:  31%. Oof.

1423
01:13:37,875 --> 01:13:38,765
Speaker 4:  Whoa. Yeah.

1424
01:13:38,765 --> 01:13:42,205
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean that everything about that, because we've, we've seen the quality

1425
01:13:42,465 --> 01:13:45,525
Speaker 5:  has dropped. We've seen people talking more about that quality. We've seen

1426
01:13:45,525 --> 01:13:49,285
Speaker 5:  people struggling with getting their cars repaired, getting, getting this

1427
01:13:49,285 --> 01:13:53,245
Speaker 5:  like customer service is really, really bad there. So yeah. All

1428
01:13:53,245 --> 01:13:57,125
Speaker 5:  those things that actually do matter to consumer experience. And and

1429
01:13:57,315 --> 01:13:59,685
Speaker 5:  Elon kind of was like, don't worry about it. We're, we're, we're building

1430
01:13:59,705 --> 01:14:02,725
Speaker 5:  The future. Eventually people are like, yes, but I want my car to work

1431
01:14:03,065 --> 01:14:07,045
Speaker 4:  Now. Right. I also think this ongoing full self-driving fiasco that

1432
01:14:07,365 --> 01:14:10,565
Speaker 4:  this company just cannot get out of where it refuses to stop calling.

1433
01:14:11,115 --> 01:14:13,965
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Full self-driving when it is not full self-driving. And actually what

1434
01:14:13,965 --> 01:14:17,805
Speaker 4:  it's doing is really dangerous. Like the, the public perception on

1435
01:14:17,805 --> 01:14:21,765
Speaker 4:  that I think is like decidedly negative at this point. Yeah, yeah. Which

1436
01:14:21,765 --> 01:14:25,525
Speaker 4:  is really like, even outside of how you feel about Elon Musk, the idea that

1437
01:14:25,525 --> 01:14:29,365
Speaker 4:  Tesla is like The future of cars in a lot of ways, like hinges

1438
01:14:29,545 --> 01:14:30,285
Speaker 4:  on that.

1439
01:14:30,865 --> 01:14:34,525
Speaker 3:  Oh, their entire valuation hinges on that. Right. Like I've watched, I mean

1440
01:14:34,925 --> 01:14:37,965
Speaker 3:  I go on CN BBC all the time. I talk to the analysts there. You, you look

1441
01:14:37,965 --> 01:14:41,845
Speaker 3:  at how the market values Tesla and it's still built

1442
01:14:41,955 --> 01:14:45,205
Speaker 3:  into the idea that you will go to work and your car will like leave your

1443
01:14:45,205 --> 01:14:48,245
Speaker 3:  house and like drive itself and be a taxi service.

1444
01:14:48,255 --> 01:14:51,125
Speaker 4:  Right. The Tesla is gonna be like infrastructure. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1445
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:54,685
Speaker 3:  Right. And like no, it's a car company. Yeah. Like

1446
01:14:54,985 --> 01:14:58,685
Speaker 3:  that's the, but all of the multiple of Tesla is built on the idea that

1447
01:14:58,905 --> 01:15:02,645
Speaker 3:  the cars will generate more value than just being a depreciating

1448
01:15:02,645 --> 01:15:04,245
Speaker 3:  asset than most people should lease.

1449
01:15:04,345 --> 01:15:06,565
Speaker 5:  So did they all think it was Uber?

1450
01:15:07,435 --> 01:15:10,805
Speaker 3:  Yeah. That's like, that's the idea here. Like the multiple. And that's why

1451
01:15:10,875 --> 01:15:14,365
Speaker 3:  Elon is constantly talking about AI now. Yeah. All this stuff. And he's like

1452
01:15:14,405 --> 01:15:18,205
Speaker 3:  a, like Tesla's really an AI company 'cause he is trying to get this other

1453
01:15:18,205 --> 01:15:21,725
Speaker 3:  thing to happen and get this other multiple. And it's like the market is

1454
01:15:21,845 --> 01:15:25,525
Speaker 3:  starting to just see a car company, a car company that shipped a triangle

1455
01:15:26,205 --> 01:15:30,005
Speaker 3:  instead of a regular pickup truck, a car company that can't

1456
01:15:30,005 --> 01:15:33,365
Speaker 3:  deliver. Like, well-made cars on the regular, like all this stuff.

1457
01:15:34,305 --> 01:15:38,165
Speaker 3:  And whose CEO is becoming more and more unpopular by the

1458
01:15:38,165 --> 01:15:42,005
Speaker 3:  day because he won't shut up. Yep. We, like I

1459
01:15:42,005 --> 01:15:45,045
Speaker 3:  talk to a lot of CEOs, they're not all pleasant people,

1460
01:15:46,835 --> 01:15:50,605
Speaker 3:  like by and large, like very aggressive type A personalities

1461
01:15:51,225 --> 01:15:55,045
Speaker 3:  in the c-suites of American companies. But they know to not,

1462
01:15:55,955 --> 01:15:59,605
Speaker 5:  They have people around them. They, they hire publicity Yeah. Firms

1463
01:15:59,745 --> 01:16:02,205
Speaker 5:  and stuff, which Elon famously refuses

1464
01:16:02,405 --> 01:16:05,085
Speaker 4:  And like, don't tweet. Turns out to be pretty good advice. Yeah.

1465
01:16:05,115 --> 01:16:08,565
Speaker 3:  Most of the time. Especially about the woke mind virus and the great replacement

1466
01:16:08,565 --> 01:16:08,765
Speaker 3:  theory.

1467
01:16:09,125 --> 01:16:12,805
Speaker 5:  Yeah. If you're a publicly traded company, don't, don't tweet.

1468
01:16:13,025 --> 01:16:16,245
Speaker 3:  If you're a publicly traded company that sells Electric cars to extremely

1469
01:16:16,245 --> 01:16:17,445
Speaker 3:  liberal people by and large

1470
01:16:18,955 --> 01:16:22,165
Speaker 3:  just doing some white supremacy on the sides. Not a great idea for you.

1471
01:16:22,165 --> 01:16:23,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. Not great for your value.

1472
01:16:23,925 --> 01:16:25,845
Speaker 3:  Anyway. It's, it's just a weird time like

1473
01:16:27,505 --> 01:16:30,725
Speaker 3:  to bring this all back around X now giving the check marks away to journalists

1474
01:16:30,725 --> 01:16:34,605
Speaker 3:  for free. Very funny. Yes. Like all the way back around. They're like, what

1475
01:16:34,605 --> 01:16:36,085
Speaker 3:  if we verified some people

1476
01:16:38,165 --> 01:16:41,765
Speaker 3:  it's 'cause they, they need people to use the platform. And I, I suspect

1477
01:16:41,765 --> 01:16:43,165
Speaker 3:  it won't work. But

1478
01:16:43,345 --> 01:16:47,205
Speaker 4:  No, if anything it, it seems to be like, do you remember that

1479
01:16:47,205 --> 01:16:50,925
Speaker 4:  moment right after they said you're gonna have to start

1480
01:16:50,925 --> 01:16:53,365
Speaker 4:  paying for the blue check? But they hadn't taken it away from people who

1481
01:16:53,365 --> 01:16:57,085
Speaker 4:  had it before and all these people were coming out saying, no, no, no. Just

1482
01:16:57,085 --> 01:16:59,685
Speaker 4:  so you know, I didn't pay for it. Yeah. It's happening. We're we're doing

1483
01:16:59,685 --> 01:17:03,205
Speaker 4:  that again where people are like embarrassed to have a blue check. Yeah.

1484
01:17:03,205 --> 01:17:06,685
Speaker 4:  But in a way that it is like, it's a, it's a badge of like you are

1485
01:17:07,045 --> 01:17:09,845
Speaker 4:  pathetically still using this platform rather than

1486
01:17:10,475 --> 01:17:11,845
Speaker 4:  something you're actually part of.

1487
01:17:12,045 --> 01:17:15,965
Speaker 5:  I was gonna say it kind of works because then you have to go log in and

1488
01:17:15,975 --> 01:17:19,765
Speaker 5:  tweet or excuse me post I didn't pay for this

1489
01:17:19,765 --> 01:17:21,885
Speaker 5:  check mark. Yeah. Like they, they Gotcha.

1490
01:17:22,265 --> 01:17:24,885
Speaker 4:  And your unre regretted user minutes go through the roof. Yeah.

1491
01:17:26,075 --> 01:17:28,085
Speaker 4:  Yeah. That's enough. Elon talk for one day.

1492
01:17:28,515 --> 01:17:32,485
Speaker 3:  Spotify reportedly having a price increase. They, they've realized they

1493
01:17:32,485 --> 01:17:35,285
Speaker 3:  increased. They look, they increased prices last year, had their best year

1494
01:17:35,285 --> 01:17:38,725
Speaker 3:  ever. They also laid off a bunch of people had cuts so they

1495
01:17:38,835 --> 01:17:42,805
Speaker 3:  increased revenue, reduced costs, heartlessly, but do it that

1496
01:17:43,155 --> 01:17:45,485
Speaker 5:  That does in fact work. Yeah. Yeah.

1497
01:17:46,085 --> 01:17:49,165
Speaker 3:  Usually maths out, there's, it's, there's not a lot of places to go from

1498
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:52,765
Speaker 3:  Spotify. Like I don't think people are like, ah, Spotify's going up. I'm

1499
01:17:52,765 --> 01:17:53,565
Speaker 3:  switching to YouTube music.

1500
01:17:54,985 --> 01:17:58,045
Speaker 4:  No, people should not and are not doing that.

1501
01:17:59,245 --> 01:18:03,045
Speaker 4:  I mean, I think to me, the thing that seems to be

1502
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:06,445
Speaker 4:  true is that 9 99 was the wrong price for streaming music.

1503
01:18:06,905 --> 01:18:10,765
Speaker 4:  We just kind of decided this like years ago. It was just like, in the same

1504
01:18:10,765 --> 01:18:14,205
Speaker 4:  way that Steve Jobs was just like, what if songs cost 99 cents? And everybody

1505
01:18:14,205 --> 01:18:18,085
Speaker 4:  was like, all right. Like a long time ago it was just like 10 bucks a

1506
01:18:18,085 --> 01:18:21,485
Speaker 4:  month and this is where we are. And it turns out that is

1507
01:18:22,555 --> 01:18:26,285
Speaker 4:  good money for record labels. Yeah. And bad both for most

1508
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:28,725
Speaker 4:  artists and most streaming companies. Well,

1509
01:18:28,725 --> 01:18:31,525
Speaker 5:  I mean, Spotify did it because that was when they were, they were coming

1510
01:18:31,635 --> 01:18:35,405
Speaker 5:  into the United States where you had this really entrenched market

1511
01:18:35,705 --> 01:18:39,165
Speaker 5:  run by Apple. Right. And they were like, okay, we gotta compete with 99 cents

1512
01:18:39,255 --> 01:18:43,245
Speaker 5:  songs. How do we do that $10 a month? And you get all of

1513
01:18:43,245 --> 01:18:46,485
Speaker 5:  the songs and, and we are all like, yes, that's

1514
01:18:46,485 --> 01:18:49,365
Speaker 4:  Victory sick. Yeah. And I think if it had been 20 bucks a month, it probably

1515
01:18:49,365 --> 01:18:51,765
Speaker 4:  wouldn't have worked. So, but if it had been 20 bucks a month, it might've

1516
01:18:51,765 --> 01:18:52,965
Speaker 4:  been a hell of a lot more sustainable.

1517
01:18:53,515 --> 01:18:57,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean, I would say the last 10 plus years of

1518
01:18:57,445 --> 01:19:01,365
Speaker 5:  like $10 a month, that's, that's pretty good run for

1519
01:19:01,425 --> 01:19:02,765
Speaker 5:  That's better run than like Netflix.

1520
01:19:02,865 --> 01:19:06,725
Speaker 4:  Oh, for sure. Yeah. No, I I actually think we as users probably saved

1521
01:19:06,885 --> 01:19:10,445
Speaker 4:  a lot of money over the last decade on, on, on

1522
01:19:10,475 --> 01:19:14,405
Speaker 4:  Spotify's dime. But I think this feels super inevitable to me. And

1523
01:19:14,405 --> 01:19:17,365
Speaker 4:  this will not be the last one. I don't think that, like, it went from nine

1524
01:19:17,365 --> 01:19:21,205
Speaker 4:  nine to 10 99 and now the report is, it's gonna go up. I think

1525
01:19:21,265 --> 01:19:24,965
Speaker 4:  either one or two more dollars. Right. Yeah. I would not be

1526
01:19:24,965 --> 01:19:28,725
Speaker 4:  surprised if a couple of years from now we're at like 15 bucks for

1527
01:19:28,725 --> 01:19:32,645
Speaker 4:  Spotify. What? I'll still pay it. Like music services

1528
01:19:32,665 --> 01:19:36,525
Speaker 4:  are awesome. I have, I have zero qualms with

1529
01:19:36,625 --> 01:19:39,605
Speaker 4:  the fact that I have all the music on Earth available to me at all times.

1530
01:19:40,185 --> 01:19:44,085
Speaker 4:  But it is, it is a bummer to see this. I'm more

1531
01:19:44,405 --> 01:19:48,085
Speaker 4:  sensitive to this for Spotify because like it's a bad

1532
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:51,165
Speaker 4:  business for Spotify. It's not Spotify being like, we make lots of money,

1533
01:19:51,165 --> 01:19:54,925
Speaker 4:  but we want more. Give us more. This is Spotify being like, we literally

1534
01:19:54,925 --> 01:19:58,045
Speaker 4:  cannot do this anymore. Please give us more money. Yeah.

1535
01:19:58,705 --> 01:20:01,805
Speaker 6:  How do y'all feel like Apple will respond to this?

1536
01:20:03,525 --> 01:20:06,405
Speaker 3:  I don't think Apple will raise their prices at all, actually. I think that

1537
01:20:06,465 --> 01:20:10,205
Speaker 3:  any price increases get rolled into Apple One. And that's just what they're

1538
01:20:10,205 --> 01:20:13,605
Speaker 3:  gonna keep doing. I think Apple Music, they run as a loss leader to get you

1539
01:20:13,605 --> 01:20:14,605
Speaker 3:  into that bigger bundle. I

1540
01:20:14,605 --> 01:20:18,205
Speaker 5:  Don't even pay for it. I get it through my Verizon

1541
01:20:18,205 --> 01:20:19,485
Speaker 5:  account. And I'm like, all right.

1542
01:20:19,955 --> 01:20:23,525
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I think Apple is very happy to let that be

1543
01:20:24,355 --> 01:20:28,045
Speaker 4:  somewhere between a, an okay business and a slightly

1544
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:31,525
Speaker 4:  less than Okay. Business in service of everything else. Yeah.

1545
01:20:31,705 --> 01:20:34,685
Speaker 3:  And they want you in that Apple one bundle. Yeah. As hard as they can be

1546
01:20:35,285 --> 01:20:38,285
Speaker 3:  when all their services went down. It was like people search for the app

1547
01:20:38,285 --> 01:20:40,925
Speaker 3:  store being down and a little bit of Apple TV and nothing else.

1548
01:20:41,425 --> 01:20:44,765
Speaker 5:  It was so sad. We were looking at the, the thing we put in like, we're like,

1549
01:20:44,765 --> 01:20:48,725
Speaker 5:  well what about Arcade? No. We couldn't even like find the line on

1550
01:20:48,725 --> 01:20:51,365
Speaker 5:  the graph. We're like, oh, that's a bummer. That's right.

1551
01:20:51,365 --> 01:20:54,205
Speaker 4:  Which is funny because Apple Music is hugely popular. Like it is, it is.

1552
01:20:54,215 --> 01:20:58,085
Speaker 4:  Apple Music and Spotify are the two winners in this market by a

1553
01:20:58,285 --> 01:20:59,165
Speaker 4:  gigantic margin. It's

1554
01:20:59,165 --> 01:21:02,285
Speaker 5:  Not the one people go Googling when they can't get it on their rush hour

1555
01:21:02,285 --> 01:21:02,445
Speaker 5:  day

1556
01:21:02,475 --> 01:21:03,165
Speaker 4:  Home. Definitely not.

1557
01:21:03,385 --> 01:21:06,965
Speaker 3:  All right. Two stories that are in conflict in really interesting ways. Hmm.

1558
01:21:07,865 --> 01:21:11,645
Speaker 3:  OpenAI has a new voice cloning model. It only needs 15 seconds

1559
01:21:12,065 --> 01:21:15,645
Speaker 3:  of audio to clone your voice. Fascinating. And

1560
01:21:15,775 --> 01:21:19,565
Speaker 3:  there was a fake George Carlin special, they settled

1561
01:21:19,635 --> 01:21:23,125
Speaker 3:  with the estate of George Carlin. They promised not to do it anymore. Actually,

1562
01:21:23,725 --> 01:21:27,525
Speaker 3:  a weird drama inside of that story is whether there was actually

1563
01:21:27,665 --> 01:21:30,405
Speaker 3:  AI used to make the fake George Carlin special, or whether they were faking

1564
01:21:30,405 --> 01:21:31,245
Speaker 3:  it, which is interesting.

1565
01:21:31,395 --> 01:21:34,885
Speaker 4:  Well, they, they admitted to writing it themselves. Yeah.

1566
01:21:35,705 --> 01:21:37,205
Speaker 4:  How the rest of it was produced,

1567
01:21:38,765 --> 01:21:42,525
Speaker 4:  I think, as far as I know at least has not been really nailed down. But the

1568
01:21:42,525 --> 01:21:46,485
Speaker 4:  idea that this was like written, produced, and created by AI just

1569
01:21:46,505 --> 01:21:49,085
Speaker 4:  flatly not true. And it's been a really fun thing going around. Like there

1570
01:21:49,085 --> 01:21:52,805
Speaker 4:  was this whole story this week about how Amazon's just walk out technology

1571
01:21:53,105 --> 01:21:56,765
Speaker 4:  was actually powered by like a thousand contractors in

1572
01:21:56,775 --> 01:22:00,685
Speaker 4:  India. Yeah. Manually reviewing your trip through to make sure that you

1573
01:22:00,685 --> 01:22:04,485
Speaker 4:  paid for everything. And I think it was Molly White who runs the, the

1574
01:22:04,835 --> 01:22:08,365
Speaker 4:  website, like, I think it's, what is it? Web3 is going great. Yeah. Who was

1575
01:22:08,365 --> 01:22:11,205
Speaker 4:  basically like, I wish I had been tracking all the times that AI turned out

1576
01:22:11,205 --> 01:22:11,965
Speaker 4:  to just be a guy.

1577
01:22:13,715 --> 01:22:17,125
Speaker 4:  It's like, and it's, it's really true. And this feels like that too. It's

1578
01:22:17,125 --> 01:22:18,165
Speaker 4:  just, it's just a guy. Yeah.

1579
01:22:18,185 --> 01:22:21,965
Speaker 5:  It doesn't help that one of 'em is like from Mad tv. Like one the hosts.

1580
01:22:22,075 --> 01:22:22,365
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1581
01:22:22,395 --> 01:22:22,685
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

1582
01:22:22,985 --> 01:22:25,485
Speaker 3:  But these two ideas are intention. We've talked about this so many times.

1583
01:22:25,515 --> 01:22:29,045
Speaker 3:  Like AI being able to clone a voice or clone a picture, da da da da. And

1584
01:22:29,045 --> 01:22:32,885
Speaker 3:  then you have and doing it faster than ever. 15 seconds of our

1585
01:22:32,885 --> 01:22:36,605
Speaker 3:  voices to clone us. Yeah. Which we have generated more of that on this very,

1586
01:22:36,605 --> 01:22:40,485
Speaker 3:  very podcast. You're welcome. And then it's like, oh, but we

1587
01:22:40,485 --> 01:22:44,165
Speaker 3:  have no controls over how those likes are used or any of that is

1588
01:22:44,445 --> 01:22:47,125
Speaker 3:  actually being done except for these handful of lawsuits that might bring

1589
01:22:47,125 --> 01:22:48,365
Speaker 3:  the whole thing crashing down. Yeah.

1590
01:22:48,365 --> 01:22:52,285
Speaker 4:  Well, and Open AI's strategy has been so far to roll it out really

1591
01:22:52,345 --> 01:22:56,285
Speaker 4:  slowly and only with a few partners. And it's like, okay, that's fine at

1592
01:22:56,285 --> 01:22:59,405
Speaker 4:  the beginning, but then what's gonna happen is you're gonna have a better

1593
01:22:59,405 --> 01:23:02,685
Speaker 4:  version of this technology that you give to everybody. Yeah. So like, what's

1594
01:23:02,685 --> 01:23:06,605
Speaker 4:  the plan then? Yeah. It's like if they were saying, you know, it

1595
01:23:06,605 --> 01:23:10,365
Speaker 4:  takes 900 hours so we're only letting a few people

1596
01:23:10,425 --> 01:23:13,365
Speaker 4:  use it because it's hugely intensive. I'd be like, okay, well whatever. But

1597
01:23:13,365 --> 01:23:15,885
Speaker 4:  this is like, we found a very good technology, but only a few people can

1598
01:23:15,885 --> 01:23:18,485
Speaker 4:  have it. And then everybody can have a very good technology. Like what are

1599
01:23:18,485 --> 01:23:22,285
Speaker 4:  we, what are we accomplishing here? Yeah. But I think, I mean this

1600
01:23:22,285 --> 01:23:25,965
Speaker 4:  is, this has been coming right? Like the, the, the New York Times,

1601
01:23:26,165 --> 01:23:29,605
Speaker 4:  I think it was this week, had a big announcement about how most of its articles

1602
01:23:29,605 --> 01:23:32,325
Speaker 4:  are now gonna be available in audio form read by

1603
01:23:33,115 --> 01:23:37,045
Speaker 4:  automated narrators like 11 Labs, which is a company we've talked about on

1604
01:23:37,045 --> 01:23:40,725
Speaker 4:  this show before, is doing like incredible slash

1605
01:23:40,725 --> 01:23:44,565
Speaker 4:  terrifying work synthesizing people's voices. Like this stuff is moving

1606
01:23:44,585 --> 01:23:48,405
Speaker 4:  as fast as any other tech in AI right now. And it's

1607
01:23:48,405 --> 01:23:52,085
Speaker 4:  getting really crazy really fast. And I feel like

1608
01:23:53,845 --> 01:23:57,285
Speaker 4:  probably should be talked about more than it is. Yeah. In the way that we

1609
01:23:57,285 --> 01:24:00,445
Speaker 4:  talk about like generated images and how they're being used in political

1610
01:24:00,685 --> 01:24:04,125
Speaker 4:  campaigns and all this stuff. Like, you're gonna start, you're gonna get

1611
01:24:04,125 --> 01:24:06,965
Speaker 4:  phone calls from Joe Biden telling you not to vote. Like that's a thing that's

1612
01:24:06,965 --> 01:24:08,925
Speaker 4:  gonna start to happen. It's already happened. Yeah. It's like it happened.

1613
01:24:08,955 --> 01:24:11,845
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And I think like this,

1614
01:24:12,545 --> 01:24:16,485
Speaker 4:  OpenAI is typically very good at this and I think is not usually

1615
01:24:16,695 --> 01:24:18,805
Speaker 4:  wrong when it says it built something good,

1616
01:24:20,545 --> 01:24:24,085
Speaker 4:  but is not great at playing it slow. Yeah.

1617
01:24:24,305 --> 01:24:27,485
Speaker 3:  By the one story that hit just as we were, we as we've been talking on the

1618
01:24:27,485 --> 01:24:31,365
Speaker 3:  search cast, Neil Mohan who runs YouTube at a conference

1619
01:24:31,435 --> 01:24:34,605
Speaker 3:  said, OpenAI should not train its systems on YouTube. Which is

1620
01:24:35,705 --> 01:24:37,525
Speaker 3:  not how OpenAI has thought about the internet.

1621
01:24:37,945 --> 01:24:41,605
Speaker 4:  No. And who was it? It was, was it Mira ti? Yeah.

1622
01:24:41,865 --> 01:24:44,565
Speaker 4:  At OpenAI. Who said to Joanna Stern, our friend

1623
01:24:45,625 --> 01:24:48,405
Speaker 4:  Joanna was when they were talking about the video thing, Sora that OpenAI

1624
01:24:48,405 --> 01:24:51,325
Speaker 4:  came out with. Joanna was like, are you training this on stuff from the internet?

1625
01:24:51,325 --> 01:24:54,925
Speaker 4:  And she was like, ah, some training stuff. Internet, public

1626
01:24:54,925 --> 01:24:57,605
Speaker 4:  private. And Joanna was like, are you getting it from YouTube? And she was

1627
01:24:57,605 --> 01:25:01,325
Speaker 4:  just like, ah. So I was like, oh, okay. So you're obviously getting it from

1628
01:25:01,325 --> 01:25:01,965
Speaker 4:  YouTube. Yeah.

1629
01:25:01,985 --> 01:25:02,965
Speaker 3:  I'm like, cool. It's not great.

1630
01:25:03,545 --> 01:25:04,125
Speaker 4:  No. If

1631
01:25:04,125 --> 01:25:07,765
Speaker 3:  Google sues OpenAI on behalf of YouTube creators for training, it's, it's

1632
01:25:07,765 --> 01:25:11,325
Speaker 3:  a weird, there's a copyright apocalypse. We did an entire decoder with Sarah

1633
01:25:11,325 --> 01:25:15,165
Speaker 3:  Jang. You can go listen to it, but there's a potential copyright apocalypse.

1634
01:25:15,235 --> 01:25:15,525
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

1635
01:25:15,665 --> 01:25:19,605
Speaker 4:  Mr. Beast is gonna make a video in which he sues OpenAI for a

1636
01:25:19,605 --> 01:25:20,245
Speaker 4:  hundred million dollars

1637
01:25:20,545 --> 01:25:23,765
Speaker 3:  And then gives the money away. Gives the money away. That would be incredible.

1638
01:25:23,875 --> 01:25:27,765
Speaker 3:  Alright, we gotta end this thing. We're way, way over. But David,

1639
01:25:27,945 --> 01:25:30,125
Speaker 3:  you should end by talking about Google Podcasts.

1640
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:33,845
Speaker 4:  Well this is a, this is a good, we're circling back around to, we're closing

1641
01:25:33,865 --> 01:25:35,485
Speaker 4:  the loop on Google, not closing the loop.

1642
01:25:35,665 --> 01:25:36,205
Speaker 3:  Ha. Very

1643
01:25:36,205 --> 01:25:40,085
Speaker 4:  Good. Google could stand to learn from us. So Google podcast is dead. Although

1644
01:25:40,085 --> 01:25:43,925
Speaker 4:  it's actually not dead. It's like ironically Google

1645
01:25:44,065 --> 01:25:46,725
Speaker 4:  has so forgotten about Google podcast that it seems to have forgotten to

1646
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:48,685
Speaker 4:  turn it off. Was that, it was that that

1647
01:25:48,685 --> 01:25:50,405
Speaker 5:  Was, its like podcast app.

1648
01:25:50,795 --> 01:25:53,525
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So it had a dedicated podcast app. It came out in

1649
01:25:53,525 --> 01:25:54,805
Speaker 4:  2016,

1650
01:25:56,315 --> 01:26:00,205
Speaker 4:  been around for a while. It did what Google does to many of its

1651
01:26:00,205 --> 01:26:02,885
Speaker 4:  apps, which is like, it launched, it had big ideas. It seemed kind of cool.

1652
01:26:02,885 --> 01:26:05,525
Speaker 4:  It, it got a couple of updates. Google forgot about it. Google launched a

1653
01:26:05,525 --> 01:26:06,725
Speaker 4:  competitor and then Google killed it.

1654
01:26:08,515 --> 01:26:12,405
Speaker 4:  This is the story of Google apps. And so the,

1655
01:26:12,465 --> 01:26:15,925
Speaker 4:  the plan here is to replace Google Podcasts with YouTube music. And they've

1656
01:26:15,925 --> 01:26:19,685
Speaker 4:  been making some moves into YouTube music. There is a, I would say strong

1657
01:26:19,685 --> 01:26:23,165
Speaker 4:  chance you are watching or listening to this podcast right now on YouTube.

1658
01:26:23,875 --> 01:26:27,125
Speaker 4:  Part of the reason Google is investing in YouTube is because that is a vast

1659
01:26:27,425 --> 01:26:31,365
Speaker 4:  and massively growing place for Podcasts. But it

1660
01:26:31,665 --> 01:26:35,365
Speaker 4:  had this really cool opportunity in Podcasts, right? Like Google, I went

1661
01:26:35,365 --> 01:26:39,125
Speaker 4:  back and read their initial thing and in 2016 when they launched this app

1662
01:26:39,265 --> 01:26:42,845
Speaker 4:  and they had these big ideas about discovery and helping people find

1663
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:47,045
Speaker 4:  insights inside of Podcasts and doing audio transcription and

1664
01:26:47,745 --> 01:26:50,725
Speaker 4:  search and all this stuff. And it's like, oh, that seems good. Like why didn't

1665
01:26:50,725 --> 01:26:54,485
Speaker 4:  you do any of that? Yeah. That would've been cool. And instead you just

1666
01:26:54,485 --> 01:26:57,805
Speaker 4:  forgot about this app for eight years and then killed it. And YouTube is

1667
01:26:57,805 --> 01:26:58,405
Speaker 4:  not gonna do that.

1668
01:26:58,625 --> 01:27:02,365
Speaker 5:  Are they gonna release Google Podcasts with Gemini

1669
01:27:02,425 --> 01:27:03,325
Speaker 5:  at Google io?

1670
01:27:03,745 --> 01:27:06,725
Speaker 3:  Oh my God would be, if they relaunched Google Podcasts at io, that was Would

1671
01:27:06,825 --> 01:27:07,325
Speaker 3:  Gemini that

1672
01:27:07,325 --> 01:27:08,245
Speaker 4:  Be incredible with

1673
01:27:08,305 --> 01:27:11,925
Speaker 3:  Gemini? They could have also solved huge amounts of

1674
01:27:12,085 --> 01:27:15,565
Speaker 3:  Podcasts analytics. Yep. And advertising problems. Yep. That everyone has

1675
01:27:15,585 --> 01:27:16,485
Speaker 3:  all over the place. Yep.

1676
01:27:17,005 --> 01:27:20,925
Speaker 4:  I heard from a lot of people after I wrote this story, I had

1677
01:27:20,965 --> 01:27:23,725
Speaker 4:  a paragraph in here basically being like, Hey Google If, you had just done

1678
01:27:24,265 --> 01:27:27,485
Speaker 4:  for audio creators what you did for video creators on YouTube.

1679
01:27:28,065 --> 01:27:32,045
Speaker 4:  You could have won this industry the same way that you did. And I heard

1680
01:27:32,045 --> 01:27:34,605
Speaker 4:  from a surprising number of podcasters who are like, I have been

1681
01:27:35,635 --> 01:27:39,365
Speaker 4:  begging slash hoping YouTube would do that for years. Like

1682
01:27:39,615 --> 01:27:43,565
Speaker 4:  build the ad tools, do the rev share. Let me post my stuff on YouTube

1683
01:27:43,565 --> 01:27:46,205
Speaker 4:  and make money from it as an audio creator. The same way you can as a video

1684
01:27:46,205 --> 01:27:49,605
Speaker 4:  creator. And there are lots of, I was about to say good reasons, but there

1685
01:27:49,605 --> 01:27:52,725
Speaker 4:  are bad reasons, but there are lots of reasons Google didn't do that. But

1686
01:27:52,785 --> 01:27:55,845
Speaker 4:  it didn't do that. And it could have, and that sucks.

1687
01:27:56,125 --> 01:27:58,925
Speaker 3:  I remember being in meetings at our company, it's like, Google's coming and

1688
01:27:58,925 --> 01:28:01,885
Speaker 3:  we better be ready. And I'm like, dude, yeah,

1689
01:28:01,955 --> 01:28:03,445
Speaker 5:  They'll get distracted. Don't worry about

1690
01:28:03,445 --> 01:28:04,565
Speaker 3:  It. It's like, I don't know.

1691
01:28:05,305 --> 01:28:08,085
Speaker 4:  But also to everyone who wants to know the answer is Pocket casts. Pocket

1692
01:28:08,085 --> 01:28:08,365
Speaker 4:  casts

1693
01:28:08,425 --> 01:28:08,645
Speaker 3:  If.

1694
01:28:08,645 --> 01:28:12,405
Speaker 4:  You want a a good cross platform podcast app that is not going to go

1695
01:28:12,605 --> 01:28:15,205
Speaker 4:  away. The answer is Pocket casts. There are other good ones out there. Antenna

1696
01:28:15,275 --> 01:28:18,485
Speaker 4:  pods, really good on Android, overcast Apple Podcasts, but If, you wanna

1697
01:28:18,485 --> 01:28:19,685
Speaker 4:  know the answer. It's pocket casts.

1698
01:28:19,905 --> 01:28:22,565
Speaker 3:  All right. We'll end there with that completely un

1699
01:28:23,185 --> 01:28:25,365
Speaker 3:  uncontroversial opinion that no one will

1700
01:28:25,545 --> 01:28:27,565
Speaker 4:  The lightning round brought to you by Pocket casts slash

1701
01:28:27,585 --> 01:28:28,405
Speaker 3:  No, you gotta pay the money.

1702
01:28:30,625 --> 01:28:34,365
Speaker 3:  We can't give this stuff away for free. Man. Perceived value.

1703
01:28:34,675 --> 01:28:35,205
Speaker 3:  Yeah, right.

1704
01:28:35,285 --> 01:28:35,645
Speaker 4:  I apologize.

1705
01:28:36,075 --> 01:28:40,005
Speaker 3:  Brought to you by anything other than Pocket Cast. All right. That's it.

1706
01:28:40,005 --> 01:28:43,885
Speaker 3:  That's The Vergecast. I'm gonna call it a few stories. Becca did

1707
01:28:43,965 --> 01:28:47,725
Speaker 3:  a comparison video of the Fuji Film X 106

1708
01:28:47,785 --> 01:28:51,725
Speaker 3:  versus the Ricoh GR three X. I'm

1709
01:28:51,725 --> 01:28:54,165
Speaker 3:  saying it slowly 'cause that's just a lot of letters. It's a lot's, a lot

1710
01:28:54,165 --> 01:28:56,885
Speaker 3:  of Roman numerals in that. Yeah, it's not good, but it's really fun. I'm

1711
01:28:56,885 --> 01:28:59,525
Speaker 3:  desperate to buy these cameras for no reason other than I just want them.

1712
01:29:01,405 --> 01:29:05,285
Speaker 3:  Allison wrote about notifications being bad, which is worth reading. She's

1713
01:29:05,285 --> 01:29:08,645
Speaker 3:  right. No takeaways. Yeah. Just like start over. Just like throw all this

1714
01:29:08,645 --> 01:29:12,125
Speaker 3:  away. It's bad. And then Liz wrote about Vice,

1715
01:29:12,945 --> 01:29:16,725
Speaker 3:  one of the weirdest, wildest stories I think we've done in a long time. We

1716
01:29:16,725 --> 01:29:18,765
Speaker 3:  did an entirely decoder with Liz about the story. She's gonna listen to that

1717
01:29:18,765 --> 01:29:22,365
Speaker 3:  next week. But the gist of it is we thought we were writing a story about

1718
01:29:22,425 --> 01:29:26,285
Speaker 3:  how advertising on the web was like went sideways and couldn't support

1719
01:29:26,285 --> 01:29:30,045
Speaker 3:  Vice. 'cause they shut down their newsroom website. Oh. So we thought we

1720
01:29:30,045 --> 01:29:33,645
Speaker 3:  were writing about like advertising cookies and programmatic and No, no,

1721
01:29:33,645 --> 01:29:37,525
Speaker 3:  we were, we were just writing about crazy people. That's the story. She

1722
01:29:37,525 --> 01:29:41,005
Speaker 3:  talked to 20 people. She described reporting that story as a hall of mirrors

1723
01:29:41,005 --> 01:29:43,405
Speaker 3:  because all hate each other. They're all lying to each other about each other.

1724
01:29:43,915 --> 01:29:46,925
Speaker 3:  It's very good. Beautiful. Including one part where it was revealed that

1725
01:29:46,925 --> 01:29:50,885
Speaker 3:  Vice had a Net Jets account that was on, on the budget of

1726
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:53,965
Speaker 3:  their digital division. And then two different people to credit for shutting

1727
01:29:53,965 --> 01:29:57,565
Speaker 3:  down. And Vice's response to us was, we have not had a net gen account

1728
01:29:57,655 --> 01:29:59,805
Speaker 3:  since 2021. Oh. Which is

1729
01:29:59,805 --> 01:30:01,885
Speaker 4:  Like, there you go. Congratulations. So did have a net

1730
01:30:01,885 --> 01:30:04,005
Speaker 3:  Gen account. That is what you're saying. We're really proud of you. It's
