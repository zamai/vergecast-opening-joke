Speaker 1:  Today on the Vergecast, oh boy. Where to begin? Reid Hastings. C e o of Netflix

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,400
Speaker 1:  is out. Microsoft might be doing layoffs. Elon Musk is still bad at business.

Speaker 1:  There's new MacBook Pros and a home Pod. Big and Cena's using AI to

Speaker 3:  Sport for today's show comes from Deloitte. What does a future look like?

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,530
Speaker 3:  It's a question that drives progress, but more importantly, how do you

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,650
Speaker 3:  get there? It's curiosity, resourcefulness and bold ideas that

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,570
Speaker 3:  can drive us even further than new technology. Because while technology can

10
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,370
Speaker 3:  take you far, human exploration could take you even farther. Deloitte

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,210

Speaker 3:  professionals. Unlock technology as powerful as your vision and push

14
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,250
Speaker 3:  the boundaries of the possible so that you can stay a step ahead with the

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,010
Speaker 3:  thinking to help you transform what's next into what's now helping

22
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,250

34
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,250
Speaker 6:  It would be great. I could use a break. I was on on the show last week, but

35
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,330
Speaker 6:  I could use a longer break. You know what I'm saying? That'd be good. I'm

36
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,970
Speaker 6:  your friend Eli, Alex Franz is here.

37
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,530
Speaker 3:  I'm your friend who wrote this intro from TE G P T. You

38
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,130
Speaker 6:  Didn't know it. That's good. I can't wait to talk about the chat. I can't.

39
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,970
Speaker 6:  I'm like bursting to get to the chat G B T section of today's

40
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,690
Speaker 6:  episode. Richard Lawler's here

41
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,090
Speaker 7:  And I have not resigned as Co C o

42
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,010
Speaker 6:  A lot of things. You don't know this cuz you're in your car, you're just

43
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,810
Speaker 6:  like driving along. It's a normal day for you. We are recording later

44
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,490
Speaker 6:  than usual because right when we sat down to record a

45
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:50,210
Speaker 6:  flurry of news took place, including Reid Hastings, a cosio of

46
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:54,130
Speaker 6:  Netflix. Just dipping. Just screw it. I'm out. So we're a little bit later

47
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,130
Speaker 6:  Richard, who runs our news team, a little bit of a scramble. If you hear

48
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,800
Speaker 6:  the the frenzy in his voice, that's where that came from. We'll get to all

49
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,880
Speaker 6:  of that. But first, Alex Heath is here. Hey Alex.

50
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,560
Speaker 8:  Hey guys. Good to be here. It's been a minute,

51
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,280
Speaker 6:  It's been a minute. You have accomplished a lot in that minute. You launched

52
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,880
Speaker 6:  a new paid newsletter called Command Line full of Dish and gossip

53
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,520
Speaker 6:  Industry goings on. I recommend people go subscribe to it immediately.

54
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,320
Speaker 8:  Yes, please.

55
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,760
Speaker 6:  Every couple days I get a note from Alex being like, guess you signed up

56
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,560
Speaker 6:  and I wish I could reveal that information to you,

57
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,720
Speaker 6:  but I'm just telling you, if you sign up for Command Line, you will be in

58
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,800
Speaker 6:  some pretty good company. I would say.

59
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,760
Speaker 8:  Yeah, we can't disclose, you know, GDPR and all that, but

60
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,640
Speaker 8:  just take our word for it.

61
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,520
Speaker 6:  The European police are outside of Alex's house right now, actually finally

62
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,920
Speaker 6:  being very European. They're just smoking and gr like grumbling at the ground.

63
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,120
Speaker 6:  They have no authority here. But Alex, you're here because this week we

64
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,680
Speaker 6:  published a gigantic feature story in collaboration with our sister publication

65
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,560
Speaker 6:  New York Magazine, and our friends at Platform are Casey Newton and Zoe Schiffer

66
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,360
Speaker 6:  about the first 90 days of Twitter under Elon Musk.

67
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,080
Speaker 6:  Just that list of collaborators. You can tell this is a big story

68
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,440
Speaker 6:  and then obviously a lot has happened in 90 days of Elon Musk. Tell us about

69
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:05,800
Speaker 6:  that story.

70
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,500
Speaker 8:  Yeah, this was a fun one, Zoe

71
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:13,100
Speaker 8:  Schiffer and Casey and I have obviously been reporting on this

72
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,940
Speaker 8:  saga, the mini twists and turns of it from the beginning since Musk

73
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,900
Speaker 8:  walked in with the kitchen sink. And you know, if

74
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,580
Speaker 8:  you're listening to this, you probably have been following it as well. A

75
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,540
Speaker 8:  lot of the details we hoped that with this story we could put together

76
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,140
Speaker 8:  not only all the, just, you know, bit by bit crazy moments

77
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,940
Speaker 8:  that unfolded after Musk came in, but also kind of

78
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,780
Speaker 8:  just show thematically what it was like working there during this

79
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,660
Speaker 8:  time. Because a lot of the coverage has been centered on Musk and on Twitter

80
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,420
Speaker 8:  as a business and the Apple stuff, which I came on and talked about last

81
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,260
Speaker 8:  time. But you know, with this, we really wanted to focus on

82
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,060
Speaker 8:  the thousands of Twitter employees who lost their jobs as a result of Musk

83
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,660
Speaker 8:  acquisition. Interviewed several of them, some on the record,

84
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,620
Speaker 8:  some not to really try to show like this is what it was

85
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,460
Speaker 8:  like working in this place. And it's, it's crazy.

86
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,140
Speaker 8:  I mean it's, it's, you can't really, you couldn't write it as a

87
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,500
Speaker 8:  screenplay, as ridiculous as it is in real life. And

88
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,860
Speaker 8:  yeah, we hope that it kind of accurately portrays what life has been

89
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,740
Speaker 8:  like inside Twitter. And i, I I think we did that. But

90
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,180
Speaker 8:  yeah, it was really fun working with Casey and Zoe. Obviously they're, they're

91
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,660
Speaker 8:  crushing it on this beat at at Platform where, and we're all continuing to

92
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,300
Speaker 8:  cover it. But yeah, get a, get a copy of extremely hardcore

93
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,460
Speaker 8:  wherever magazines are sold near you, I guess, I guess

94
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,380
Speaker 8:  you can also read it online. Yeah. Since people do that, but I

95
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,140
Speaker 8:  actually haven't seen a print copy of it yet, but they exist,

96
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,140
Speaker 8:  I'm told, I'm told magazines are a thing.

97
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,740
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's a real, as somebody who has exclusively run a digital

98
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,580
Speaker 6:  publication for over a decade every, this is our third collaboration

99
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,080
Speaker 6:  with New York magazine and obviously they run a great website too, but they

100
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,000
Speaker 6:  make up print magazine and they have for over 50 years. And so

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,840
Speaker 6:  sometimes like whenever we collaborate with them, like, oh this is, this

102
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,760
Speaker 6:  is different, it's different. It's

103
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,920
Speaker 8:  Just very different. And I'm, and I'm, I'm obviously like kidding about like

104
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,840
Speaker 8:  people don't, don't re I actually do New York Mag is low-key, like a great

105
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,160
Speaker 8:  magazine and, and yeah,

106
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,760
Speaker 6:  I don't even low key, they're just a

107
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,520
Speaker 8:  Great magazine, but like, you know, it's, you, you gotta be subtle with like

108
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,800
Speaker 8:  your magazine flexes, you know, you don't want to be too

109
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,680
Speaker 6:  Over

110
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,560
Speaker 8:  The top. But yeah, I, I highly recommend

111
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,920
Speaker 8:  reading it in print I haven't gotten to yet, but they did an amazing job

112
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,720
Speaker 8:  and our team did an amazing job on the site too with the wealth meter,

113
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,960
Speaker 8:  which I think was your idea Eli, kind of

114
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,800
Speaker 6:  My only true contribution to the story. Well, so I mean I'll actually, let's

115
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,920
Speaker 6:  talk about that for a minute. Yeah, so not the wealth meter itself, which

116
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,800
Speaker 6:  is very funny. And that's the rest of the episode actually. It's just me

117
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,520
Speaker 6:  taking credit for the gimmick that I put in

118
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,520
Speaker 8:  The story. Yeah, shout out Graham. Shout Graham. Yeah.

119
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,760
Speaker 6:  Our engineer Graham built that for me. I didn't like the last minute, but

120
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,360
Speaker 6:  the where that came from and really the, the story

121
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:03,080
Speaker 6:  is we, we are like, we should do a big feature about Elon and Twitter and

122
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,760
Speaker 6:  then it's like what, what is the thesis statement of that story? What is

123
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,700
Speaker 6:  the end of that story? Like a great story. This is

124
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,220
Speaker 6:  a kindergarten level writing assignment has a beginning, a middle, and an

125
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,660
Speaker 6:  end. We barely have a middle of this story,

126
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,580
Speaker 6:  right? There's this really chaotic beginning period

127
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:25,220
Speaker 6:  we think it feels Alex, I mean this is my question to you really is

128
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:29,300
Speaker 6:  have we reached a steady state of Twitter under

129
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,860
Speaker 6:  Elon? I don't know the answer to that question. We certainly do not have

130
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,700
Speaker 6:  an end, right? It is not a success or a failure. I, my instincts

131
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,300
Speaker 6:  tell me it's going in one direction and not the other. But we don't know.

132
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,620
Speaker 6:  So like how do you even write this story? And so we picked linear time.

133
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,500
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Like here's 90 days, let's see what happens.

134
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,020
Speaker 8:  And we have reached an end, which was Twitter as it was

135
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,540
Speaker 8:  premus, right? So all the employees who are not either,

136
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,740
Speaker 8:  basically you fall into the camp of you're there for visa

137
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,420
Speaker 8:  healthcare work stability reasons, or you're

138
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,660
Speaker 8:  a kind of a mercenary, you're trying to rise up through the power vacuum.

139
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,980
Speaker 8:  Anyone who doesn't kind of fall into those camps has left by now. So

140
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,300
Speaker 8:  the company's a shell of what it once was, both in terms of

141
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,540
Speaker 8:  scale, size of people, but also the DNA of,

142
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:18,540
Speaker 8:  of the people who made the company over the last, you know, decade

143
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,580
Speaker 8:  plus. And so yeah, I think that was the bow on the story was

144
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:26,380
Speaker 8:  just kind of like he's flushed everyone out and now they're all suing him.

145
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,820
Speaker 8:  And I think the current, the current stand is there's

146
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,380
Speaker 8:  over 800 individual ex-employees

147
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,380
Speaker 8:  filing in arbitration cases against Twitter right now, which

148
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,940
Speaker 8:  Twitter has to pay those legal fees, which are, can be in the tens of thousands

149
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,780
Speaker 8:  per arbitration.

150
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,500
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah. So this a, a fa this is like a

151
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,180
Speaker 6:  fascinating, I don't know c plot of the Twitter story is this

152
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,020
Speaker 6:  arbitration thing.

153
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:54,940
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Musk no stranger to employment disputes

154
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,920
Speaker 8:  is now finding himself with even more. Yeah.

155
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,520
Speaker 6:  And well he's, this is like the cutting edge of employment

156
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,640
Speaker 6:  disputes. So the, the backstory of the arbitration thing is all these companies

157
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,120
Speaker 6:  wrote arbitration, mandatory arbitration clauses

158
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,480
Speaker 6:  into their employment contracts that went up to the Supreme Court and Supreme

159
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,280
Speaker 6:  Court said that's fine. And so then the strategy is because of what

160
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,890
Speaker 6:  you're saying because the companies agree to take on those costs because

161
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,730
Speaker 6:  the calculation in their minds was we'll go to arbitration, which is

162
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,410
Speaker 6:  friendlier to the corporation, we'll agree to pay the costs and will come

163
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,290
Speaker 6:  out ahead. And so what employment lawyers like plaintiff employment

164
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,890
Speaker 6:  lawyers have discovered is, oh, we can just find a

165
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:39,050
Speaker 6:  thousand people who are mad at you and file 1000

166
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,250
Speaker 6:  individual arbitration cases that you have to pay for

167
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,850
Speaker 6:  and that you cannot collect and do a class action or

168
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:51,370
Speaker 6:  join the cases like you would in a normal court. Now you just have 1000

169
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:55,210
Speaker 6:  cases to pay for all individually. And that's like when

170
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:55,370
Speaker 6:  they

171
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,650
Speaker 7:  Wrote those policies, they didn't realize that they would be laying off thousands

172
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,170
Speaker 7:  of people at once who were all going to be extremely pissed.

173
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,490
Speaker 6:  I just think they thought everyone else's, like there's like a level of a

174
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,930
Speaker 6:  giant corporation where it's like you think everyone's stupid, you know,

175
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,770
Speaker 6:  and that you're smarter than 'em and you like realize like, oh crap, like

176
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,250
Speaker 6:  this is an unexpected consequence of this thing. And it is very much

177
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:18,530
Speaker 6:  the cutting edge of employment law. This is a new development that

178
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:22,370
Speaker 6:  passed like two years, maybe not even. And so Musk is like at

179
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:26,170
Speaker 6:  the cutting edge of this style of employment dispute. He's

180
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,850
Speaker 6:  invented a lot of things. The Rockets land themselves. I'm not sure that

181
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,730
Speaker 6:  he wants to spend his time inventing an outcome to mass

182
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,570
Speaker 6:  simultaneous arbitration.

183
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,010
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Which

184
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,130
Speaker 6:  Is like, there are rich people, there are smart people who are very engaged

185
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,730
Speaker 6:  in inventing at the end to this cuz it's the cutting edge. I don't think

186
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,650
Speaker 6:  that's where Elon wants to be.

187
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,210
Speaker 8:  No, he doesn't. I don't know where he, he definitely doesn't want to be anywhere

188
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:50,650
Speaker 8:  near San Francisco, as I'm sure you may talk about later. He tried

189
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,210
Speaker 8:  unsuccessfully to get another lawsuit over his Tesla tweeting

190
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:58,050
Speaker 8:  moved out of San Francisco due to apparent, you know, bias. His lawyer

191
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,530
Speaker 8:  argued there in San Francisco. They couldn't find jurors was the argument

192
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:04,810
Speaker 8:  that didn't, you know, that would have a neutral view of us. Didn't Yeah.

193
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,050
Speaker 8:  Which we, you know, I don't, we need to get into a tangent, but I thought

194
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,570
Speaker 8:  it was, there was a tweet thread of his lawyer arguing in court the other

195
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,970
Speaker 8:  day that the reason the four 20 tweet should not be,

196
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:19,290
Speaker 8:  you know, considered as, you know, something that he

197
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:23,210
Speaker 8:  has to worry about is that he's a reckless tweeter and like this is his personal

198
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:26,850
Speaker 8:  lawyer being like, this is our legal defense. He is a reckless tweeter,

199
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,330
Speaker 8:  the CEO of Twitter. Let's

200
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:28,730
Speaker 6:  See how that works

201
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,570
Speaker 8:  For him. But yeah, no, I think the current, the current state, so now that

202
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,370
Speaker 8:  we've moved from, you know, the really chaotic him taking over

203
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,210
Speaker 8:  phase to now trying to figure out how to land the

204
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:43,650
Speaker 8:  plane, I think he drew analogy to like, this is a plane flying into the ground

205
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:48,290
Speaker 8:  at at top speed financially is

206
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,970
Speaker 8:  Twitter, blue is a dud. I just saw some analysis that

207
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,850
Speaker 8:  he hasn't even even managed to double the subscription count from before

208
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:59,490
Speaker 8:  he took the company. So there's less than 300,000 Twitter blue

209
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,130
Speaker 8:  subscribers.

210
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,090
Speaker 6:  You know what, he has doubled. He's doubled a number of people who show up

211
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,050
Speaker 6:  in my mentions whenever I tweet after having said a moment, I

212
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,370
Speaker 6:  have to break my previous relationship with Twitter. That's like, you're

213
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,130
Speaker 6:  back and all of those people pay for Twitter

214
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:16,730
Speaker 8:  Blue. Yeah, that's true. There's a nice overlap of like, you have 12

215
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,570
Speaker 8:  followers and some kind of weird like

216
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:23,930
Speaker 8:  Joe Byron thing in your bio and you're a Twitter blue subscriber.

217
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,410
Speaker 6:  Yeah. If you're one of those like sunglass truck guys, he's

218
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,890
Speaker 8:  Got you. But yeah, so that's a dud. The company's revenue was down

219
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,450
Speaker 8:  40% year over year as of this month.

220
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,050
Speaker 8:  So losing hundreds of millions of dollars since he took over and they're

221
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,450
Speaker 8:  auctioning off all the furniture. So that's the current state

222
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,250
Speaker 8:  of of Twitter. That's

223
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,690
Speaker 6:  A bad place. Yes. That's where our story ends. Yeah.

224
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,970
Speaker 8:  Did, did we put, did TC put a bid in on the bird logo?

225
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:54,170
Speaker 6:  Tcs really thought about 20, $18,000 on the bird logo.

226
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,170
Speaker 6:  I'm not sure if he mean, he obviously thought about it enough that he did

227
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:02,090
Speaker 6:  not spend $18,000 on the bird logo, but he, he thought about

228
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:06,010
Speaker 6:  it more than anyone should. Like I thought about spending $18,000 on

229
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:09,330
Speaker 6:  the bird logo and the way that you always think about buying anything, you're

230
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,090
Speaker 6:  like, that'd be great. And they're like, wait, this is stupid. TC kept going

231
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,170
Speaker 6:  for a little bit longer than

232
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,730
Speaker 8:  18,000. That's gonna be the price of a used Tesla in a few months. Well

233
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,370
Speaker 6:  That was the open, that was the opening bit. I'm not even sure where it's

234
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:20,570
Speaker 6:  at now.

235
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:24,490
Speaker 8:  Yeah, well you know, they need all the money they can get and that's

236
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,370
Speaker 8:  the current state. But yeah, I guess just to like bring it full circle with

237
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,330
Speaker 8:  the piece, like I think we accurately captured the frank

238
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,650
Speaker 8:  cruelty of how Musk treated the employees

239
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:39,570
Speaker 8:  there. Which like you can say what you want about Musk as a innovator.

240
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:43,330
Speaker 8:  As a technologist. His track record does speak for itself there.

241
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,210
Speaker 8:  He treated these people horribly and you know, it's not that

242
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,450
Speaker 8:  we also talk about how in the piece like Twitter was not run well. People

243
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:54,370
Speaker 8:  there knew that it needed a reset, it needed a kick in the pants, but I

244
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,690
Speaker 8:  don't think anyone was necessarily expecting just the,

245
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:01,730
Speaker 8:  the cruelty of how like the first month unfolded. Yeah.

246
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,730
Speaker 8:  And now the chickens are are are roosting and like, you know, there's

247
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,410
Speaker 8:  800 arbitration cases. So

248
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,810
Speaker 6:  I feel like we have to issue this disclaimer that we do every time we talk

249
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:15,770
Speaker 6:  about Twitter criticizing the Elon Musk regime of Twitter is in no way

250
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:19,570
Speaker 6:  condoning or saying the previous regime did anything good

251
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:23,490
Speaker 6:  at any time. Yeah. Like it was bad then it was really

252
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,250
Speaker 6:  bad and now it's still pretty bad and it's that middle period, it's the transition.

253
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,930
Speaker 6:  This hasn't really happened to any company ever where in the middle of the

254
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:34,850
Speaker 6:  Halloween party an acquisition closes and the executives get marched

255
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,410
Speaker 6:  out the door. Yeah. Which is an incredible scene in this story.

256
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,290
Speaker 8:  Well the, to make things even better is that this is how crazy things were

257
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:45,210
Speaker 8:  that week. Like there was a, a scarecrow walking around with a handler

258
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,530
Speaker 8:  at the party and everyone thought it was Musk at first

259
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,240
Speaker 8:  because of the handler and the way it was the gonna be the mc for the evening.

260
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,120
Speaker 8:  And they're like, the Scarecrow is gonna remove its mask and it's

261
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,960
Speaker 8:  gonna be Musk after he just escorted Rgc out of the building. But yeah,

262
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,680
Speaker 8:  it's, it was, it was an insane time and I don't think it's gonna get

263
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,240
Speaker 8:  less insane. I think it'll probably just get weirder with Twitter, but

264
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,560
Speaker 8:  Yeah. You know, Elon's still tweeting through it and while we all watch

265
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,360
Speaker 8:  So fun story.

266
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:17,200
Speaker 6:  So here's a, the thing that I've been thinking about and the, the question

267
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,800
Speaker 6:  I I've been wanting to ask you, but we needed to wrap this story up so don't

268
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,600
Speaker 6:  wanna distract you. It feels like the, you know, the window, the chaos is

269
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,520
Speaker 6:  over, like the window of the chaos story. Everyone gets it. All the

270
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,320
Speaker 6:  people are gone. The people who are left are either people. I think

271
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,280
Speaker 6:  the three of you wrote about it and the story is people who see chaos as

272
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,600
Speaker 6:  a ladder, they see the power vacuum, they see the opportunity to move up,

273
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,320
Speaker 6:  they wanna be close to Elon or it's people who are stuck there on visas or

274
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,200
Speaker 6:  need health insurance, right? So you got this weird two classes

275
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,400
Speaker 6:  of people, but the kind of chaos is over the everyday

276
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,600
Speaker 6:  machinations of chaos have at least simmered down a little bit. Now it's

277
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,160
Speaker 6:  like what is next? Like if Twitter blue isn't working and the

278
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,440
Speaker 6:  advertisers aren't coming back and the revenue is down and you know, the

279
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,520
Speaker 6:  loans are coming due against the Tesla stock and Tesla stock is down

280
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,040
Speaker 6:  the next turn seems actually way more devastating.

281
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,720
Speaker 8:  Yeah, I mean there is a real, I mean he's been a, he's used the, it's hard

282
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,560
Speaker 8:  to, to separate when Musk is just kind of using a shtick

283
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,200
Speaker 8:  versus what, when he actually means what he's saying. He said before

284
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,200
Speaker 8:  at his other companies that they're on the verge of bankruptcy and it's been

285
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,560
Speaker 8:  more of a way to motivate people to kind of get through a hard time. He's

286
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,440
Speaker 8:  been saying the same thing now inside Twitter. You know, we could go bankrupt.

287
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,720
Speaker 3:  What a management style

288
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,640
Speaker 8:  Get through this. I don't think that actually happens, you know, I

289
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,440
Speaker 8:  don't even with how, you know, Musk appears to be going off the

290
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,920
Speaker 8:  rails in some ways. Like I don't think he's actually gonna light 44 billion

291
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:43,760
Speaker 8:  on fire in under a year. He's definitely on the way,

292
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,960
Speaker 8:  but there's a lot of people with a lot of stake in Twitter trying to

293
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,800
Speaker 8:  figure this out that I, I just, I think he would be something he couldn't

294
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,120
Speaker 8:  really come back from necessarily. But

295
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,800
Speaker 3:  I mean haven't that's been like nobody thought he was gonna

296
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,880
Speaker 3:  light the money on fire, but he still did it. Like when he said I'm gonna

297
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,720
Speaker 3:  buy it Yolo, what was it, 42, 20 or whatever,

298
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,400
Speaker 3:  like that initial price that he did. Yeah. 54 20. Like he

299
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,880
Speaker 3:  still repeatedly has said, no, it's, it's

300
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,840
Speaker 3:  fine, I'm cool. And then absolutely fallen on his face.

301
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,360
Speaker 3:  So I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility that he's gonna fall

302
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,720
Speaker 3:  on his face again with Twitter.

303
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:25,240
Speaker 8:  No, it's not. It's not. And I think with every passing week

304
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,040
Speaker 8:  that looks more likely, but for

305
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,800
Speaker 8:  now it's, you know, he, he said the goals to be break even this year.

306
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,680
Speaker 8:  And I think you can do that. But I mean, Twitter

307
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,640
Speaker 8:  as a product, I don't know about you all. Like it's, it's getting worse.

308
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,920
Speaker 8:  It's getting uglier to look at both in terms of what they're recommending

309
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,320
Speaker 8:  and just like the pixels and the way things are organized.

310
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,570
Speaker 8:  So yeah, I, I don't know. I I

311
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,890
Speaker 8:  want to try to like, you know, I want Twitter to live. I don't, you know,

312
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:57,570
Speaker 8:  it's, we, I think a lot of us who have fond memories of Twitter don't want

313
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:01,410
Speaker 8:  it to die, so we'll see. But it's not looking, it's not looking

314
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:05,370
Speaker 8:  hopeful. I also just like haven't succumbed to the, to Mastodon

315
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:09,010
Speaker 8:  and I don't really think there's any other clear alternatives.

316
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,890
Speaker 8:  So there's not, I I don't know, you know, we all came back on Twitter

317
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:15,330
Speaker 8:  to promote the, the features, the cover story, like

318
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,210
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I

319
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:18,530
Speaker 6:  Was like, what else?

320
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:19,650
Speaker 8:  So

321
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,290
Speaker 6:  I should have made like a TikTok, like one of Thoses of me like on green

322
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,290
Speaker 6:  screened over the story

323
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:25,850
Speaker 8:  Likey

324
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:26,890
Speaker 6:  At the headline. Yeah.

325
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,770
Speaker 8:  I don't know. I I think we did kind of summarize the chapter

326
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:34,330
Speaker 8:  that has now ended and now we're in this uncertain period of can he keep

327
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,370
Speaker 8:  it from totally, you know, burning and

328
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:41,730
Speaker 6:  You know, you, you mentioned Macon, so I have not joined Macon either.

329
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,530
Speaker 6:  I don't, I haven't had Twitter on my phone for months now. I I only use it

330
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:49,170
Speaker 6:  at work and I just use it to basically retweet people who tweet

331
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:53,010
Speaker 6:  decoder. It's a great way to use Twitter. What I miss, the thing

332
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,410
Speaker 6:  that I miss the most is Twitter during n f L games

333
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:00,130
Speaker 6:  and I find myself bringing my laptop to the living room

334
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,490
Speaker 6:  so I can just like read sports writers cuz they're still using it. That's

335
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,170
Speaker 6:  it. Everything else is like, I come to it and I look at it during the work

336
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,970
Speaker 6:  day. I'm like another scandal that will come to nothing.

337
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:13,890
Speaker 6:  It's erupted on Twitter. Just, it just doesn't, I don't care about the

338
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,770
Speaker 6:  royal family so good though. And I close my laptop and I walk away. That's

339
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:20,570
Speaker 6:  fair. I don't, my people have escaped them twice. Right. I'm an

340
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:23,890
Speaker 6:  Indian American. Yeah, that's two times fair. And I'm, I'm out. It's not

341
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:27,730
Speaker 6:  for me. That's my go-to line. Someone's gonna steal it from me and they're

342
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,770
Speaker 6:  gonna make a million dollars in the back of that line. That person's gonna

343
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:33,730
Speaker 6:  be Mindy Kaling. Anyhow, all I'm saying is like, it feels

344
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:36,770
Speaker 6:  like my brain is healing because I don't have feed-based social media in

345
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:40,610
Speaker 6:  my life and I, I I think I may might eat it back.

346
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:41,210
Speaker 6:  You know, like

347
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,370
Speaker 8:  Yeah, you're like, I'm I'm twitchy now.

348
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:47,330
Speaker 6:  I'm like Jonesy, I feel too healthy. Did I tell this to you when you guys

349
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:51,210
Speaker 6:  were I had massive fomo CS and I actually, I got a text

350
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:55,170
Speaker 6:  from a dear friend you, so you will can obviously guess who

351
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:59,050
Speaker 6:  it is. And he is like, I'm jonesing for a vape. And I

352
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,130
Speaker 6:  was like, oh, my body just wants nicotine during the first week of January.

353
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,210
Speaker 6:  Like, that's, that's what I've been doing for a long time.

354
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,410
Speaker 6:  I've been in Vegas and like, that's how I feel about like this weird feed-based

355
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,290
Speaker 6:  social media that has been at the center of the media ecosystem for a long

356
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:16,650
Speaker 6:  time. And I, maybe I'll come back to it. Maybe I'll sort of mast, maybe I'll

357
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:20,330
Speaker 6:  turn the whole version of mast on like, who knows. But it

358
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:23,930
Speaker 6:  right at this second, it's like, oh, I should just let my brain heal. And

359
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:27,690
Speaker 6:  I feel like a lot of the ecosystem is in that moment where it's not like

360
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:31,130
Speaker 6:  we have to immediately go to Mastodon and it's like, oh, we can play with

361
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,930
Speaker 6:  this a little bit, but it's actually better for everyone if we walk away

362
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:35,490
Speaker 6:  from this for a

363
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:39,010
Speaker 8:  Second. Neil, you know, the fans, the readers want a verge

364
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,890
Speaker 8:  mastodon. They want, they want us in the fed averse.

365
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,130
Speaker 6:  If you are a software developer with a vengeance and you want to turn the

366
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,400
Speaker 6:  entire verge into a maid on instance,

367
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,560
Speaker 8:  That's going to happen

368
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,800
Speaker 6:  Now. I'll hear you out.

369
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,480
Speaker 8:  No, it's going to just happen this weekend. Someone's

370
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,200
Speaker 6:  Gonna be like curious. We're just gonna do it. I I'm not, not kidding. Like

371
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,560
Speaker 6:  Macon is really just a micro blogging platform. Yeah, it's not a Twitter

372
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,840
Speaker 6:  clone. Right. You can do a lot with

373
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,600
Speaker 8:  It. It's like, it's like WordPress but harder to understand. Yeah,

374
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,040
Speaker 6:  It's a, it's just a syndicated blogging platform. They just made the UI look

375
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,400
Speaker 6:  more like Twitter than not. So people think it's a replacement. But that

376
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,360
Speaker 6:  means if you were to start a publication like ours from scratch,

377
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,320
Speaker 6:  you could actually start, you could do that Macon, which is a fascinating

378
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,200
Speaker 6:  thought

379
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,080
Speaker 8:  Experiment. Well, medium Medium did this. They have a Macon instance, so

380
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,600
Speaker 8:  you know, that means Macon is here to stay

381
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:34,440
Speaker 6:  Soon they will begin paying some writers pennies to publish our medium.

382
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,480
Speaker 6:  Yes. And then they'll take that money away and shut it.

383
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,800
Speaker 8:  We're gonna clap for our toots. Well, I

384
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:43,800
Speaker 8:  I I should probably go and finish command line, but I I I just want to

385
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,440
Speaker 8:  Yeah, plug it shamelessly like you did at the top and say

386
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,120
Speaker 8:  especially you guys are gonna talk about chat g p t later. I, so by the time

387
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,480
Speaker 8:  this comes out, I'll have an interview with the CEO of Notion, they're doing

388
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,080
Speaker 8:  a really interesting implementation of chat G P T. They have unique

389
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,840
Speaker 8:  visibility into the space. I think people will find that interesting. Already

390
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,720
Speaker 8:  have done interviews with Jack Dorsey, c of Shopify, CTO

391
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,240
Speaker 8:  of Meta have had some scoops, some people

392
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,760
Speaker 8:  moves. Yeah, check it out. It's, it's an experiment. I'm having fun.

393
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,320
Speaker 8:  verge.com/command line. Yeah,

394
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,440
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it is very fun. I encourage people to go read it and

395
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,160
Speaker 6:  honestly, if you wanna be ahead of the curve, that's, that's the place to

396
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,960
Speaker 6:  be. I'm trying to sell here fir like first I'm selling my idea that we should

397
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,800
Speaker 6:  trend the entire version of mass on server and now have opened the Overton

398
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,320
Speaker 6:  window. I'm like, you should subscribe to a newsletter. You see, it's a tactic,

399
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:38,960
Speaker 6:  escalating levels of commitment. All right Alex, it's great to talk to you

400
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,600
Speaker 6:  man. We'll talk to you soon.

401
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,280
Speaker 8:  Thanks guys.

402
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,320
Speaker 6:  Thanks to Alex. We're gonna take a quick break. We'll right back. We have

403
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,080
Speaker 6:  a lot to talk about today. We'll grab.

404
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,790
Speaker 1:  Today's episode is sponsored by Aura. Here's the riddle. What's the

405
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:57,350
Speaker 1:  point of a sleep tracker if it's so bulky that wearing it keeps you awake?

406
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:01,350
Speaker 1:  Lots of stuff is trackable these days. Your heart rate, your steps, but you're

407
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,230
Speaker 1:  only going to get something out of the data if you have a device you actually

408
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:07,990
Speaker 1:  want to wear. But the Aura Ring gives you personalized health insights, all

409
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:11,870
Speaker 1:  from a comfortable to wear water resistant ring during the daytime. The

410
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:15,510
Speaker 1:  ring sensor technology tracks heart rate, calories burned in your activity

411
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:19,390
Speaker 1:  levels, and then at night it tracks info on your body temperature, trends,

412
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:23,390
Speaker 1:  sleep quality, respiratory rate and more. You get all that personalized

413
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:27,310
Speaker 1:  data in your Aura app so you can work on building healthy habits. What I

414
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:31,070
Speaker 1:  like about the Aura Ring is that it just disappears. I forget I'm even wearing

415
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:34,710
Speaker 1:  it. One small ring could make a world of difference in your health visit

420
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,430
Speaker 9:  Hi, I'm John Glenn Hill and I'm the new host of The Weeds,

421
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,670
Speaker 9:  a podcast from Vox all about politics and policy.

422
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,990
Speaker 9:  Our mission is to take deep dives into policies shaping our world,

423
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,110
Speaker 9:  everything from crypto regulation to immigration to

424
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,510
Speaker 9:  climate change. And this week for my first

425
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:12,950
Speaker 9:  official episode in the host chair, we're firing up the weeds time machine.

426
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:16,030
Speaker 9:  And taking a trip back to 1965

427
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:20,190
Speaker 10:  Today is a triumph for freedom. As

428
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:23,950
Speaker 10:  huge as any victory that's ever been won

429
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,310
Speaker 10:  on any battlefield

430
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,270
Speaker 9:  To talk about one of the most significant pieces of civil rights legislation

431
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,830
Speaker 9:  in US history, the Voting Rights Act, and with

432
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:36,870
Speaker 9:  questions swirling around election integrity and the future of American democracy,

433
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,590
Speaker 9:  we figured there's no time like the present to look back on it,

434
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,750
Speaker 9:  subscribe to the weeds for new episodes every Tuesday.

435
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:56,600
Speaker 6:  All right, we're back. There's a lot to talk about. There's

436
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,400
Speaker 6:  obviously new Apple News, there's new MacBook Pros with M two chips.

437
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:04,550
Speaker 6:  There's a new HomePod. I'm making the most sarcastic

438
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:07,630
Speaker 6:  of air quotes possible. There's a new HomePod, I could hear 'em,

439
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:12,270
Speaker 6:  there's Microsoft layoffs and this thing about their hardware portfolio.

440
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,750
Speaker 6:  Netflix just got a new ceo. There's like a lot going on and all

441
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,070
Speaker 6:  this stuff happened like in the minutes before we were set to start recording.

442
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:25,710
Speaker 6:  But I can we talk about CNET and AI and chat G P T and

443
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,030
Speaker 6:  and what's going on over there first?

444
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,320
Speaker 9:  Yes,

445
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,640
Speaker 6:  The robots took our jobs. I, I dunno what else there used to say the robots

446
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,240
Speaker 6:  are coming for our jobs. So last week, so I called

447
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,560
Speaker 6:  futurism, broke this story. CNET is secretly using

448
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,720
Speaker 6:  AI to write articles and it was like, I I would say it was

449
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,600
Speaker 6:  90% a secret cuz the byline

450
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,320
Speaker 6:  on the articles. So CNET money staff. And then if you like clicked it,

451
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:55,900
Speaker 6:  it would tell you that it was written by AI with a human editor. Yeah,

452
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,860
Speaker 6:  I've run a digital news site for a long time, no one's clicking. So it

453
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:03,300
Speaker 6:  was, it was, it was not hidden but it was hidden, right? The story picks

454
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:07,100
Speaker 6:  up. People go wild obviously in the context of chat G p T, there's just

455
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:11,060
Speaker 6:  unhinged discourse. The robots are coming for our

456
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,420
Speaker 6:  jobs. Journalism is, journalism is over. Why do you even need this? We started

457
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:17,940
Speaker 6:  looking into it. Mia Sato on our team and James Vincent, who's our AI reporter,

458
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,580
Speaker 6:  he's been on the first cast recently assigned him to a go figure out what's

459
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,980
Speaker 6:  going on here. And they came back, we, we just published the story

460
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,700
Speaker 6:  and what we'll kind of get to the story itself in a minute, but they came

461
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,530
Speaker 6:  back with what I think of as just like a dead ahead

462
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:36,490
Speaker 6:  verge creator story. Like there's a platform, it has

463
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:40,370
Speaker 6:  an algorithm. People try to game the algorithm to make more money. Like

464
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:44,240
Speaker 6:  the bones of this story are the same as YouTubers gaming, YouTube

465
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,080
Speaker 6:  or TikTok ERs gaming TikTok or Instagramers Gaming Instagram or

466
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,970
Speaker 6:  whatever. It's just the platform is

467
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:55,730
Speaker 6:  Google search. And the web and CNET,

468
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:59,330
Speaker 6:  instead of being a TikTok is a voracious private

469
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:03,170
Speaker 6:  equity money machine. Well not cnet, so it's just not it like,

470
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:06,490
Speaker 6:  it's just not as in it. But the the basics of it are the same but

471
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,570
Speaker 3:  Not cnet, it's Red Ventures, right? That now

472
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:12,250
Speaker 6:  Owns cnet. Right? So we should, we should say the top CNET is our

473
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:16,050
Speaker 6:  competitor. This is a disclosure. Do I need to disclose that? The Verge

474
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:19,210
Speaker 6:  competes against cnet. The verges competing against CNET for a long time

475
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,850
Speaker 6:  when we were all little babies and we just started the thing. We're like

476
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:25,330
Speaker 6:  we're gonna get seen like whatever we did it wired in cnet. Those are always

477
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:29,290
Speaker 6:  our competitors. We are friends with a great many people who

478
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:32,970
Speaker 6:  work at CNET who have worked at cnet. We just were talking about kc. KC came

479
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:36,960
Speaker 6:  to us from cnet. We've sent people to cnet Socos,

480
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,740
Speaker 6:  it's a big industry. CNET in 2008

481
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,860
Speaker 6:  was worth 1.8 billion. And it was, I

482
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,700
Speaker 6:  know this because C Bs bought it for 1.8 billion,

483
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,940
Speaker 6:  which is just a crazy sentence just you car

484
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:56,980
Speaker 6:  pull over and I want you to say out loud to yourself. In

485
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,540
Speaker 6:  2008, one year after the iPhone was released,

486
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:04,100
Speaker 6:  C Bs bought CNET for

487
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,020
Speaker 6:  1.8 billion.

488
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:11,660
Speaker 6:  That's more than Facebook bought. Instagram for Facebook, bought

489
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:15,420
Speaker 6:  Instagram for a billion, that's more than Google bought YouTube

490
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:19,220
Speaker 6:  for Google was bought YouTube for 1.65 billion

491
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,980
Speaker 6:  C Bs bought CNET for

492
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,820
Speaker 6:  1.8 billion in 2008.

493
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,180
Speaker 3:  You don't think that was a

494
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,940
Speaker 6:  Goodbye? So I, I get it with

495
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,580
Speaker 7:  Last fm, it's a content strategy that makes sense. I understand it.

496
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:37,980
Speaker 6:  Fast forward, many things happen between 2008 and

497
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,700
Speaker 6:  2020. Again, this is one year after the iPhone is released.

498
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:45,580
Speaker 6:  So one year after the Comet hits the earth, they're like

499
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,020
Speaker 6:  1.8 billion on CNET

500
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,220
Speaker 6:  the com. The comet it turned out had hit the earth upends the entire media

501
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,100
Speaker 6:  ecosystem upends the world, right? Mobile upends the world 2020

502
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:01,460
Speaker 6:  C B s flips CNET to a company called Red Ventures for

503
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:05,340
Speaker 6:  500 million. I think it is safe to say this was not a good

504
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,900
Speaker 6:  investment for them. Flip it to this company called Red Ventures. Red

505
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,780
Speaker 6:  Ventures is, they're not a secret. They've been profiled them in the

506
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,740
Speaker 6:  New York Times. They own a lot of things. They own the Points

507
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,100
Speaker 6:  guy, they own bank rate.com, they own credit cards.com.

508
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,340
Speaker 6:  Are you sensing a theme here? They own things that people with

509
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,140
Speaker 6:  credit cards go to visit a lot and they, it's a

510
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,660
Speaker 6:  massive portfolio. They own a lot of like search content

511
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:34,500
Speaker 6:  farms. Like when you're searching for some, when you're searching for like

512
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,300
Speaker 6:  credit card are the best points and you land on the Points guy and the Points

513
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,940
Speaker 6:  guy's great. We know people who work there too. Yeah, and you land on the

514
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,600
Speaker 6:  points guy. How does the Point Sky make money? It's affiliate links to sign

515
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,920
Speaker 6:  up for credit cards. So Red Ventures is buying all of these

516
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,840
Speaker 6:  sites that have lots and lots of search authority and they're like

517
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,480
Speaker 6:  pumping them full of affiliate links, which again is a totally

518
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:58,480
Speaker 6:  like well-known content strategy. The wire cutter, another competitor of

519
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,120
Speaker 6:  ours, I feel like I just like, if it's a website, it competes with us. Like,

520
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,640
Speaker 6:  I'll just be honest, the the wire cutter started by

521
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,080
Speaker 6:  Brian Lamb who started Gizmoto way back in the day. Yep. He started, it was

522
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,560
Speaker 6:  basically like, here's the best phone and you, I'm just like one phone and

523
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,800
Speaker 6:  here's the link to buy it. Totally monetized by affiliate links. He flipped

524
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,740
Speaker 6:  that to the New York Times for 30 million. And then the, you can ask

525
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,700
Speaker 6:  a lot of people how it's going over there, but whatever.

526
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,740
Speaker 3:  Now he surfs

527
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:25,860
Speaker 6:  And now Brian mostly surfs his car. His Instagram is, he's a great carpenter.

528
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,620
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So Cena gets bought by this private equity company called Red

529
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,220
Speaker 6:  Ventures for 500,000,002 years ago. And then all of this

530
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:37,700
Speaker 6:  AI stuff starts showing up. And so they got caught out last week,

531
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,900
Speaker 6:  but me and James go and do their reporting and it turns out that Red

532
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,660
Speaker 6:  Ventures is pretty much open about the fact that they use

533
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:49,660
Speaker 6:  AI across their portfolio. They've been doing it on CNET for a while. Every

534
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:53,580
Speaker 6:  single morning CNET again, our com our competitor, I think it's

535
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:57,340
Speaker 6:  fair to call them a tech publication every single morning around

536
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,940
Speaker 6:  nine o'clock CNET publishes, here are today's mortgage rates and here are

537
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,420
Speaker 6:  today's mortgage refinance rates.

538
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:07,260
Speaker 6:  Let's just imagine if a Virgin did like you would, people would kill me,

539
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,980
Speaker 6:  like our staff would kill me

540
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,540
Speaker 3:  First quick

541
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:13,100
Speaker 6:  Post. They're obviously doing that because those people search for that.

542
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,060
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And that's a service you can provide people. Like here's, here's the

543
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,660
Speaker 6:  information. But why do you do that if Santa Cuz you're huge, you have a

544
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,380
Speaker 6:  lot of search authority and when people go to sign up for a new

545
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:26,260
Speaker 6:  mortgage or to refinance their mortgage, you collect an affiliate bounty

546
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,180
Speaker 6:  on the back of it.

547
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,140
Speaker 3:  And I don't think we can overstate how much authority seen it has because

548
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:34,500
Speaker 3:  it's been around, it was created what, in like the 1990s?

549
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:38,380
Speaker 6:  It was, yeah. It was created so long ago that c b s bought it for one point

550
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,500
Speaker 6:  billion in 2008.

551
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:47,340
Speaker 3:  Like it has a lot of authority and that's one of

552
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,500
Speaker 3:  the reasons it stayed one of the top ranks tech sites in the world is because

553
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:53,420
Speaker 3:  it has so much authority. You go and you Google something, you're probably

554
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,260
Speaker 3:  gonna find a CNET link and you're probably gonna cook on it because you're

555
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:59,820
Speaker 3:  like, I recognize them. And so like, I think that was the reason Red Ventures

556
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,580
Speaker 3:  bought them, right? Was because they wanted that authority.

557
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:06,180
Speaker 6:  I mean, if someone's like, Hey, this thing was worth 1.8 Billy, but you could

558
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,660
Speaker 6:  have it for 500 million, why not? You know, like,

559
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,180
Speaker 3:  Hey, what a deal. What a deal. Sometimes

560
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:16,020
Speaker 6:  You just gotta Tumblr it, man, this couch just needs to be reupholstered.

561
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,980
Speaker 6:  You know, you, you did a thing where you cut the skirts off the bottom, you

562
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,540
Speaker 6:  exposed the legs, you saw it on Facebook Marketplace for five times what

563
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:25,420
Speaker 6:  you bought it Red Ventures. So, but if that's your game, right? This is your

564
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,300
Speaker 6:  monetization. You're gonna buy all these sites with search authority for

565
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,380
Speaker 6:  really high value search terms and then you're gonna put affiliate links

566
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,340
Speaker 6:  on those pages and then when people click on them, you get paid.

567
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,060
Speaker 6:  And this is a real thing, particularly for credit cards. We were doing some

568
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:42,240
Speaker 6:  research. The number, if you click on a credit card affiliate link

569
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:46,200
Speaker 6:  on one of these sites and you sign up the bounty, the

570
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,440
Speaker 6:  Affiliate Bounty is right now like $250

571
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:52,520
Speaker 6:  in the past for Red Ventures specifically

572
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:57,040
Speaker 6:  $900. Wow. Right? So if

573
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,480
Speaker 6:  you, if they can get you to sign up for one of these crazy credit cards,

574
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,320
Speaker 6:  like, you know, the metal and all the, all the point system is all this stuff,

575
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:08,320
Speaker 6:  the high end, the top tier ones, the visa infinites, and you actually

576
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,880
Speaker 6:  sign up through one of their links up to $900.

577
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:16,220
Speaker 6:  So this is a totally lucrative play for them. A totally lucrative play for

578
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:20,020
Speaker 6:  the points guy on all these other sites that they, that they own. But that

579
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,970
Speaker 6:  means you're not really trying to do anything except

580
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:27,530
Speaker 6:  get people to click those links on your pages. Right. I will disclose, we

581
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:31,290
Speaker 6:  also have affiliate links on our pages. We disclose them per the FTC

582
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:34,450
Speaker 6:  guidelines. They're, they're connected to our reviews program. But like our

583
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:38,170
Speaker 6:  reason for being is tech journalism. And we do

584
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:42,330
Speaker 6:  that stuff to pay for the tech journalism. I, I think

585
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:45,770
Speaker 6:  that makes sense. Like if you read our reviews, a lot of them are like, you

586
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:46,410
Speaker 6:  shouldn't buy this.

587
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,650
Speaker 7:  It made a lot more sense before you just told me that they're getting $900

588
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,130
Speaker 7:  on each referral link. I don't

589
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:56,370
Speaker 6:  Right. A lot, a lot of their, you should sign up for the XX card and that's

590
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:59,210
Speaker 6:  just across the portfolio. So if you, if that's the game you're playing your

591
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:02,290
Speaker 6:  private equity and this is the money machine you're running and you're just

592
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:06,210
Speaker 6:  trying to pump Google search with content so you can convert on

593
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,650
Speaker 6:  these links. Like why would you have people do that work?

594
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:14,260
Speaker 6:  Like you, you can't, there's no way an actual human being wakes up every

595
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,700
Speaker 6:  day at CNET and like looks up the mortgage rates, fills out this template

596
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,780
Speaker 6:  and hits published every single day between nine and

597
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,380
Speaker 6:  9:30 AM for like two years.

598
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:26,900
Speaker 7:  I bet there's someone on TikTok doing an absolutely unhinged to get ready

599
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,620
Speaker 7:  with me every morning, nothing but the mortgage rates and putting on makeup.

600
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,180
Speaker 7:  I I can find them. I'll, I'll look.

601
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,860
Speaker 6:  I'm just saying. But that's like you would, you would want a robot to that.

602
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,820
Speaker 6:  You should have a robot to that.

603
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:37,860
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

604
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:42,380
Speaker 6:  If I assigned one of our reporters to do that job, they'd be like, screw

605
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,980
Speaker 6:  you, get a robot to do it. Or they were sold, you don't have reporter. They

606
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,740
Speaker 6:  would say they were doing it and figure out how to make a robot do it on

607
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,780
Speaker 6:  their own. Right? Like if you have an office job in America today and you

608
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,100
Speaker 6:  have not figured out Excel automations, like you're just robbing yourself

609
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,020
Speaker 6:  of time, that's time you could be on TikTok. It's like, why wouldn't you

610
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,660
Speaker 6:  do this? And the answer is like, oh, you should do this a lot. Of course

611
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,660
Speaker 6:  you should have AI write content with a capital C

612
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:08,820
Speaker 6:  against popular search terms and publish them just at

613
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:12,300
Speaker 6:  mass volume on your site with an enormous amount of search authority so that

614
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,620
Speaker 6:  you can convert affiliate links at $250 or $900 a piece.

615
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,620
Speaker 6:  The problem is one that that can't be

616
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,540
Speaker 6:  self-sustaining. Right? At some point you're just not gonna have a staff

617
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:26,260
Speaker 6:  left to even turn on the robots because journalists don't wanna be around

618
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,820
Speaker 6:  that two, eventually you're gonna destroy your brand,

619
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,220
Speaker 6:  right? Like CNET will be known for just being a content farm. And then three,

620
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:36,500
Speaker 6:  and I think this is like the big story and honestly, and it's like this is

621
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,440
Speaker 6:  gonna be the big story of the year. Eventually Google's gonna be like, yo,

622
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,680
Speaker 6:  our search results are full of garbage, right? Yeah. People will type in

623
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,640
Speaker 6:  what is the best credit card and you just get, which they

624
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,280
Speaker 3:  Do robots

625
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,640
Speaker 6:  Trying to get you to sign up for credit cards and like, why would I use Google

626
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:48,960
Speaker 6:  then?

627
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:53,120
Speaker 3:  And Google hates that. Like, to be clear, Google hates when you try to game

628
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,680
Speaker 3:  the system every couple of years they do like a big panda update

629
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:00,640
Speaker 3:  and they're like, our job here is to destroy this gaming. And then

630
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,400
Speaker 3:  you watch a lot of companies who are like, their whole business is

631
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,880
Speaker 3:  gaming the SEO go, oh crap. And trying to figure out how to game it again.

632
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:12,360
Speaker 3:  And so like, I don't think there's a long runway for this ai, well

633
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,480
Speaker 3:  there's a long runway, but I don't think there's a good ending for this AI

634
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,240
Speaker 3:  gaming with Google.

635
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:22,040
Speaker 6:  I I think Google honestly to me, like, yes, this story c yes, story about

636
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,410
Speaker 6:  a competitor. I mean the story itself is great. You should read it. The,

637
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:29,730
Speaker 6:  an editor resigned and wrote a letter to hundreds of of people that

638
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:33,530
Speaker 6:  she had the letter written by chat G p T, which is like

639
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,690
Speaker 6:  a perfect detail. And in the letter she accuses CNET slash

640
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:41,130
Speaker 6:  Red ventures of sending out a cybersecurity newsletter

641
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:44,210
Speaker 6:  written by AI without disclosing it and saying like, there's actually bad

642
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:47,490
Speaker 6:  advice in there. That's a, that's just a straight up scandal, right?

643
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,010
Speaker 6:  Yeah. You have this line that the last line of the story is

644
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:55,250
Speaker 6:  CNN employees do not fear AI more than they fear the numerous layoffs. Red

645
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:58,490
Speaker 6:  Ventures insist upon everyone at CNET is more afraid of red ventures than

646
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:02,450
Speaker 6:  they are of ai. Like there's a, there's a story here. It's not really about

647
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:05,930
Speaker 6:  cnet, right? It's about private equity gaming, Google

648
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:09,050
Speaker 6:  search and the affiliate marketing ecosystem.

649
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,730
Speaker 6:  Ruthlessly and I, you know, they're private. It's like being mad at a tiger

650
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,850
Speaker 6:  for being a tiger. It's a PE company. Like this is what they, it's their

651
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:18,970
Speaker 6:  job. They buy companies and squeeze them for money and they move on. Like,

652
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:23,250
Speaker 6:  I'm mad at the locust, like, what are you gonna do? CNET though is

653
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:27,010
Speaker 6:  like the storied news powerhouse and it's, it's being gutted by these

654
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:30,690
Speaker 6:  forces. And honestly it's because Google search is

655
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:34,570
Speaker 6:  gameable in this way and yet they do panda updates. But just

656
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:38,170
Speaker 6:  compare that to other platforms. Compare that to YouTube, compare

657
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:42,130
Speaker 6:  that to Instagram, compare that to TikTok, compare that to even Twitter,

658
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:46,210
Speaker 6:  right? YouTube is like, boy, there's a lot of garbage on our platform.

659
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:49,930
Speaker 6:  We're just changing the algorithm to deran it or demonetize it and we'll

660
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:52,570
Speaker 6:  change the incentive so people make this other thing that we want. And then

661
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,810
Speaker 6:  the garbage, I mean, Google struggled with proliferates and then it comes

662
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:58,490
Speaker 6:  back like whatever. But all the other platforms do that Google

663
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:02,290
Speaker 6:  search is just subtly getting worse, right? It's like it

664
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:06,210
Speaker 6:  hasn't, it does not incentivize good stuff in the way that

665
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:09,810
Speaker 6:  the other platforms at least give like lip service to

666
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,050
Speaker 6:  incentivizing good stuff.

667
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,970
Speaker 3:  I do wonder, is there a cur, is there, like, like with Google,

668
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:18,490
Speaker 3:  there's an entire industry, they're called like the SEO

669
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:22,090
Speaker 3:  industry. It's all these people trying to game Google and it's been around

670
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:25,850
Speaker 3:  since as long as Google's existed. Is there like an SEO

671
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:30,090
Speaker 3:  industry for TikTok and for YouTube and for these other

672
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:31,890
Speaker 6:  Platforms? Oh yeah, dude, yeah.

673
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,330
Speaker 3:  But is it as big?

674
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,980
Speaker 6:  It's, I don't know if it's as big, but I, the difference

675
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:41,900
Speaker 6:  is like the SEO industry is, it's

676
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,260
Speaker 6:  diffuse, right? It's like copy writers and keyword

677
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:49,100
Speaker 6:  experts and whatever. Like there are agencies and they have different kinda

678
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,020
Speaker 6:  like pieces of the puzzle and there's just like a lot of like yeah.

679
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,220
Speaker 6:  Generalized SEO knowledge that exists because Google is big and

680
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:59,260
Speaker 6:  it's like hard to wrap your head around the fact that Google search is a

681
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,340
Speaker 6:  platform, right? You think the web is a platform, right? But like Google

682
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,940
Speaker 6:  search is a, pla is a discovery platform, just like Instagram is a discovery

683
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:10,100
Speaker 6:  platform. The other platforms, TikTok, whatever, because there's like

684
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,940
Speaker 6:  a unification there between the creation tool, the distribution tool, and

685
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,580
Speaker 6:  the discovery engine. Those people are not like SEO experts, they're just

686
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:21,500
Speaker 6:  like a TikTok creative agency. Yeah, right. Like our audience team is

687
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,460
Speaker 6:  like, here are the TikTok trends that we should do on, on the vir decoder

688
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:27,980
Speaker 6:  this week. And I'm like, we don't do, we should do them more. Like,

689
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,580
Speaker 6:  you know, there's that one where like people were like sad on a boat and

690
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,860
Speaker 6:  like the decoder team was like, you gotta make a deco that's, we're actually

691
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,180
Speaker 6:  doing that next week. I was like, I dunno, I can do this.

692
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:42,020
Speaker 6:  I love boats, but I don't like being sad on them. And I, there's, I I think

693
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,300
Speaker 6:  that unification from the other platforms makes makes them easier to perceive,

694
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,100
Speaker 6:  right? You can like I like that. Yeah, Instagram is a platform. You can

695
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,420
Speaker 6:  kind of see the beginning and end of it. You can see the whole thing Google

696
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:56,300
Speaker 6:  search, like no one can perceive it, right? And it feels organic.

697
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:00,260
Speaker 6:  And again, these are like very sarcastic air quotes. Like it feels like you

698
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,300
Speaker 6:  ask the robot a question, the robot tells you to answer it, but then you,

699
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,060
Speaker 6:  you like really poke at it. You're like, oh, it's like better to search Reddit.

700
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,460
Speaker 6:  Right? Or it's like there's a reason people think that chat G P T will replace

701
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:12,900
Speaker 6:  Google. It's because it doesn't return SEO spam to you. It just

702
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,820
Speaker 6:  confidently lies to you. And like it turns out, like what

703
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:20,300
Speaker 6:  is, what is the lesson of the world of the immediate ecosystem from 2016

704
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,180
Speaker 6:  on confident lies are very popular. I'm sorry, I'm laughing.

705
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:27,860
Speaker 7:  Well, I think something that I've noticed with kind of the way that people

706
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:31,100
Speaker 7:  are using search engines and we, we sometimes we talk about how, especially

707
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:34,140
Speaker 7:  young people, they'll search TikTok or something instead of searching Google.

708
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,740
Speaker 7:  And I was talking to a friend of mine the other day and, and I had a thought

709
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:41,380
Speaker 7:  that it's not necessarily that they trust the results

710
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:44,780
Speaker 7:  of when you search on TikTok, those things are, are black boxes. You, you

711
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:48,060
Speaker 7:  still don't know why it gave you this result or that result over another.

712
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:52,060
Speaker 7:  It's, but for us old people, when we used to dial

713
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:55,700
Speaker 7:  into a, a customer service line and hit zero or we're yelling

714
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:59,980
Speaker 7:  operator, you just want hear from a person. Yeah. And

715
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:03,700
Speaker 7:  that's what TikTok or Instagram can give you is an, or Reddit

716
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,660
Speaker 7:  especially, can give you an answer that appears to come from a person now

717
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,380
Speaker 7:  with chat G P T, who knows? But yeah, it appears to come from a real

718
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,820
Speaker 7:  human being somewhere. And there, there's, there's something about that that

719
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,740
Speaker 7:  you'd probably have the, you'd probably rather have that than the correct

720
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,580
Speaker 7:  answer. And, and Google has been promising the correct answer and it's not

721
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,220
Speaker 7:  delivering that anyway. Yeah.

722
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,580
Speaker 6:  And I I'm telling you, Google, this is gonna be a bad year for Google. They've

723
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:27,460
Speaker 6:  got, they've gotta deal with it from both sides, right? So first people are

724
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:31,340
Speaker 6:  gonna start talking to chat G P T and Google itself cannot deliver

725
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:35,240
Speaker 6:  that technology. They invented it like that Transformer tech, the t and chat

726
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,960
Speaker 6:  G B T is Google Transformer like they made it and they

727
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,920
Speaker 6:  have the big models, they have LLMs that can compete that they, like

728
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,800
Speaker 6:  Google will tell you are better than chat G P T, but they can't release it

729
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,680
Speaker 6:  because they know it will confidently lie to people. It will tell people

730
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,520
Speaker 6:  the wrong answer. It will feed people misinformation with such

731
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,360
Speaker 6:  confidence that people will believe it. And if you're Google, that is

732
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,720
Speaker 6:  a, that's existential risk for you.

733
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:04,280
Speaker 3:  We did a, we did a story this week about how this guy had made

734
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:08,400
Speaker 3:  use chat g p t to make an entire voice assistant. And he

735
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,080
Speaker 3:  was like, yeah, it works really well. It works so much better than Siri.

736
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:15,040
Speaker 3:  I hope I didn't just Siri, but

737
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,600
Speaker 3:  the reason he was like this would never make the mainstream is that this

738
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:22,160
Speaker 3:  thing will confidently tell you the wrong information or confidently be like,

739
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:26,280
Speaker 3:  now you're a white supremacist like chat. G p t doesn't have all those

740
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,080
Speaker 3:  barriers in place that Google's put up, but Google is also getting

741
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,920
Speaker 3:  so gamed by other people and has like failing

742
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:38,000
Speaker 3:  to stop that gaming. I keep wondering, is somebody gonna make an add-on

743
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:41,920
Speaker 3:  for Google where you just automatically blacklist sites that you know,

744
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,760
Speaker 3:  ooh, suck and don't actually give you answers.

745
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,480
Speaker 6:  Right? But

746
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,720
Speaker 3:  Actually I have to go talk to Graham, excuse

747
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,240
Speaker 6:  Me, but here's what I'm saying something Google

748
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:49,640
Speaker 3:  Right

749
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,880
Speaker 6:  Now, so Google's got an input problem,

750
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:53,680
Speaker 6:  right?

751
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:54,600
Speaker 3:  Yeah.

752
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:58,760
Speaker 6:  Man, what I'm gonna get this wrong. If you can do the framing of this

753
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,040
Speaker 6:  better, please let me know. Google has a supply problem.

754
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:06,280
Speaker 6:  That's the first thing. So Google, it's the

755
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,080
Speaker 6:  suppliers are websites, the, the Verge polygon, whatever it is.

756
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:14,160
Speaker 6:  And we publish stories and we hope Google searches them. And if you

757
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,080
Speaker 6:  search for inside Twitter's first 90 days, we very much hope

758
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,920
Speaker 6:  that you land on the verge.com. Okay? Fair enough. The

759
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,440
Speaker 6:  problem is the supply that is being fed into Google is being overrun

760
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:29,960
Speaker 6:  by SEO optimized AI garbage, right? And so Google has to deal

761
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,480
Speaker 6:  with that first. Then they've got like a, a demand

762
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,840
Speaker 6:  problem. This is where if you have a better framing, let me know they have

763
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,760
Speaker 6:  a demand problem, which is the people coming to

764
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,320
Speaker 6:  Google are increasingly like, but I could just ask chat g p t

765
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:48,320
Speaker 6:  and they won't deliver me this garbage. Or I could just ask Alexa, or I could

766
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:52,280
Speaker 6:  just ask Siri or Bing actually has a, you know, Microsoft has a

767
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,160
Speaker 6:  huge funding. The old open AI Bing is gonna integrate traction.

768
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,800
Speaker 6:  Maybe maybe people are gonna start asking Bing

769
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:04,880
Speaker 6:  what the stranger things have happened. Apple came back from the dead, right?

770
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:08,880
Speaker 6:  CBS bought CNET for 1.8 billion in 2000.

771
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,000
Speaker 6:  Who knows what's gonna happen? So they've got like this weird supply problem

772
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:18,960
Speaker 6:  or a demand problem where the people who use Google increasingly think the

773
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,200
Speaker 6:  product is not good and they're searching Reddit or they're searching TikTok

774
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,880
Speaker 6:  or whatever. And the suppliers of Google's results

775
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:30,240
Speaker 6:  are increasingly cynical and flooding it with garbage, which makes the

776
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,040
Speaker 6:  demand problem worse. Right? And how do you, how does Google get,

777
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,760
Speaker 6:  this is their money. This is what they got. Yeah. Right. Like I,

778
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,000
Speaker 6:  there's not a Google messaging platform that makes money or exists

779
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:45,520
Speaker 6:  or is used, right? Like they, they have this and they have YouTube and

780
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,440
Speaker 6:  if this goes away, like Google Falls apart, and I, I think they just gotta,

781
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:52,840
Speaker 6:  I don't, they have to articulate a path through it and they have not done

782
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,400
Speaker 6:  that yet. Yeah.

783
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,240
Speaker 3:  Well, and they've, they often refuse to like, this isn't a new problem.

784
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,800
Speaker 3:  SEO gaming in absolute garbage being the top of the search results is

785
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,400
Speaker 3:  a problem they've been dealing with for the, for the entire time Google's

786
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,080
Speaker 3:  existed. But they never articulate that problem or treat it as

787
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,720
Speaker 3:  what they are they, what you said, their platform. They don't

788
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,960
Speaker 3:  view themselves as a platform. They don't view their problem as a platform,

789
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,640
Speaker 3:  as a content moderation problem. They view it as like an engineering

790
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:22,760
Speaker 3:  really Twitter, Elon Musk kind of way. They view it as an engineering problem.

791
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,440
Speaker 3:  And as long as they continue to do that, I think we're gonna just have garbage.

792
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,640
Speaker 3:  When you go search Google and then you go to Reddit,

793
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:32,600
Speaker 7:  You remember before Google when there were search engines that

794
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,840
Speaker 7:  weren't Google that people used and they were just indexes mama. And there

795
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,600
Speaker 7:  was just some guy who was like, these are the TV websites or these are the

796
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,240
Speaker 7:  websites that you can go to for NFL Richard

797
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,040
Speaker 6:  Lawler tv websites list.com

798
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,840
Speaker 7:  Down. You can go down folders to the entire end of the internet

799
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,200
Speaker 7:  because someone had listed every single thing and there was, there was at

800
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,960
Speaker 7:  his heart a person. Yeah. And now you have Google, which

801
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,880
Speaker 7:  assumed that all the data coming into it was reliable that all those links,

802
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:01,280
Speaker 7:  they meant, they meant something that, that if you, if you link something,

803
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,960
Speaker 7:  it must have been a person who put that there because they liked it. And

804
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,760
Speaker 7:  that just isn't true anymore. That just, that that world is gone now. I

805
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,520
Speaker 6:  Like that your fut your prediction of like the future of the web is back

806
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,480
Speaker 6:  to Yahoo, like OG Yahoo

807
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:15,320
Speaker 7:  InfoSec

808
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:19,280
Speaker 6:  Obviously Infoseek, we should make a custom cure. I have

809
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,640
Speaker 6:  so many products. Okay, if you can turn the Verge home page into a mass instance,

810
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,300
Speaker 6:  like let me know. We'll just do that on the side and I'll go to the CO and

811
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:29,020
Speaker 6:  be like, Hey, look at what I did and we'll see how long I stay in this drum

812
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:33,100
Speaker 6:  open to it. Hit me up. And if you want to code like a hand

813
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,620
Speaker 6:  curated like vintage 1999 search engine.

814
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:40,900
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Could be pretty sweet. I'm gonna lie,

815
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:45,260
Speaker 6:  be sick. But I really do think like ye yes. Cena, yes ai,

816
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,500
Speaker 6:  yes, it's a scandal. And you should read that story. Mia and James did a

817
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,140
Speaker 6:  fantastic job of that story. I'm just telling you that is a scandal. That

818
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:56,300
Speaker 6:  it's like the symptom and the disease is

819
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:59,940
Speaker 6:  the absolute rot of the web platform. And in

820
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:03,820
Speaker 6:  particular how Google search has influenced the web platform. And like I'm

821
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:07,800
Speaker 6:  tell like this year I will tell you is it's either up or down.

822
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,800
Speaker 6:  Like there something is gonna happen in there because all of the other places

823
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,400
Speaker 6:  people make content are, are effectively closed. Right? And

824
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:17,880
Speaker 6:  I always joke that at, you know, the, the end point of every U YouTuber's

825
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,640
Speaker 6:  initial life cycle before they become a butterfly is the video where they're

826
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:25,320
Speaker 6:  like, I'm pissed at YouTube. And then like, yeah, the light bulb goes off

827
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,920
Speaker 6:  and they realize, oh, I'm just playing the game. Right? And that doesn't

828
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,320
Speaker 6:  happen on the web and it's because, because we don't recognize that like

829
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,520
Speaker 6:  Google is the controlling influence of the web. I think it's because its

830
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,600
Speaker 6:  name is Google and it's like logo looks like it was made by a five-year-old.

831
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,840
Speaker 6:  Like we just don't, we can't perceive it. Well I

832
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:42,440
Speaker 3:  Think you have, you have different paths into, into websites than you do.

833
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,400
Speaker 3:  Like Google is the primary path for the majority of people for like the vast,

834
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,720
Speaker 3:  vast majority of people. More people than most of our listeners. Probably

835
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:53,440
Speaker 3:  fully understand Google is that way. But there's still other ways. You still

836
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,040
Speaker 3:  go and read places like the verge.com and we point you to cool stuff

837
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:01,040
Speaker 3:  or your mom sends you a cool link. Like there's still other ways to get to

838
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,080
Speaker 3:  this stuff. That's

839
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,920
Speaker 6:  It's just third product. Third product and it's just a distribution system

840
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,000
Speaker 6:  for Alex's mom to send people links. It

841
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,720
Speaker 3:  Would be terrible. You'd get one link

842
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,640
Speaker 6:  A day and I guarantee you we'll be able to game that one better than anyone

843
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,520
Speaker 6:  else. But it'll be honest.

844
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:16,000
Speaker 3:  Yeah, you'll know a person did

845
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,800
Speaker 6:  It. You'll know that I made Alex specifically tell her mom to pick the

846
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,760
Speaker 6:  verge version of the story.

847
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,040
Speaker 6:  All right, we gotta take another break. We'll be right back. We gotta talk

848
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,600
Speaker 6:  about this new Apple stuff. M two chips and new. It's great. We'll be right

849
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:29,800
Speaker 6:  back.

850
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:41,720
Speaker 6:  All right, we're back a bunch of stuff. We have lot to talk about, all of

851
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,360
Speaker 6:  which like happened in the last eight seconds. We announced a new

852
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:49,320
Speaker 6:  MacBook Pro with the M two PRO and M two max chip, a New Mac mini with

853
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,640
Speaker 6:  M two and M two pro ships, then new HomePod. There's a rumor that

854
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:57,160
Speaker 6:  they're doing some sort of weird Google homey smart display.

855
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:01,000
Speaker 6:  Microsoft had layoffs. They're talking about Reju a hardware portfolio, which

856
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,600
Speaker 6:  is really interesting. And of course Netflix, Reed Hastings,

857
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:08,640
Speaker 6:  founder and CEO step down new co CEOs at Netflix.

858
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,360
Speaker 6:  Let's start with Apple. I feel like we have to, we've made people sit through

859
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:15,400
Speaker 6:  Yeah, a, a long and winding

860
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,760
Speaker 6:  argument about the future of the web. I would say that's why you come here.

861
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:23,160
Speaker 6:  But I think you also come here for us to complain about the MacBook Pro.

862
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:23,720
Speaker 6:  So

863
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:28,880
Speaker 6:  this is more or less what we are expecting. Don't you think that it's the

864
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,440
Speaker 6:  same design and then Yeah, the M two PRO and M two max

865
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:36,400
Speaker 6:  kind of the same basic idea as the M one PRO and M

866
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,440
Speaker 6:  one max. They just stitched more 'em

867
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,840
Speaker 3:  Together. Yeah, it's, it's just the M one faster

868
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:45,200
Speaker 6:  Like, and like linearly faster, right? Like faster by

869
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:45,760
Speaker 6:  core counts.

870
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:48,600
Speaker 3:  Yeah. They were like, we added more cores, now it's faster. And you're like,

871
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,960
Speaker 3:  thank you. They, that's what I wanted.

872
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,560
Speaker 6:  They did say that these are the longest battery life

873
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:56,160
Speaker 6:  ever in a Mac laptop, which is pretty incredible

874
00:49:56,590 --> 00:50:00,320
Speaker 3:  That I'm really excited about because the M two didn't,

875
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:04,160
Speaker 3:  when we, when we reviewed the M two in the MacBook Air, it didn't get better

876
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:08,000
Speaker 3:  battery life, but it also had a totally different design than the M

877
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,600
Speaker 3:  one MacBook Air. So I'm really, really curious to see how these M two

878
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:16,120
Speaker 3:  14 and 16 inch laptops hold up to the previous version.

879
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:20,400
Speaker 6:  It's also interesting to me that Apple is starting to just admit that people

880
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,120
Speaker 6:  use Creative Cloud. So they say the Macro Pro MT Pro is able to process

881
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:28,080
Speaker 6:  images in Adobe Photoshop up to 40% faster than the M one Pro and up to

882
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,880
Speaker 6:  80% faster than MacBook Pro with a core I nine. Okay. I mean, I

883
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:35,760
Speaker 6:  have an M one Pro, MacBook Pro 16 inch is the best computer

884
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,360
Speaker 6:  I've ever owned. Yeah, you love it. I mean, I don't, I don't use Photoshop

885
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,960
Speaker 6:  enough to need a 40% boost, but that's pretty impressive from one

886
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,960
Speaker 6:  generation to another, I think.

887
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:47,840
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Yeah. And like the, the, the jumps sound really, really

888
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,760
Speaker 3:  impressive. And I think we just have to wait and see because Apple is

889
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,600
Speaker 3:  also still learning how to talk about processors and speed bumps and they

890
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:59,080
Speaker 3:  still do lots of charts that have no meaning. And so we

891
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,400
Speaker 6:  Still need to Oh, can I talk about these fucking charts?

892
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:02,520
Speaker 3:  Let's talk about the charts. I think

893
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,040
Speaker 6:  They made them just

894
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,760
Speaker 3:  For you. I was hoping you'd wanna talk about the charts.

895
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:09,080
Speaker 6:  Okay. So usually I complain about these charts. You do.

896
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:13,040
Speaker 6:  And usually what I complain about is that the Y axes aren't

897
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:13,320
Speaker 6:  labeled.

898
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,000
Speaker 3:  It's simply good.

899
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,440
Speaker 6:  Pretty normal. If you're in the, if you're in the business of complaining

900
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,000
Speaker 6:  about charts like isn't chestnut, you just bring this outta your back pocket.

901
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,880
Speaker 6:  You're like, they didn't label the Y axes. And everyone's like, oh. And like

902
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,160
Speaker 6:  you playing the hits, you know,

903
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:30,460
Speaker 6:  app Apple has now gotten to a place where

904
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:34,180
Speaker 6:  there are effectively no axes at all. Yes.

905
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,140
Speaker 6:  And nothing is labeled. So it's like, see how the M two PRO and

906
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:41,440
Speaker 6:  M two max stack up and then it's just some lines

907
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:45,520
Speaker 6:  with no axes and it just, the M two

908
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:49,800
Speaker 6:  max MacBook Pro is purple and it just says

909
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,400
Speaker 6:  15.9 x

910
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:54,760
Speaker 3:  I, I wanna judge them. But when I was first doing

911
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,440
Speaker 3:  processor benchmarks and I would post charts, I also

912
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,440
Speaker 3:  did that cuz I was like, people just wanna see a line go up. They don't care

913
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:02,800
Speaker 3:  about the

914
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,080
Speaker 6:  Axes. Yeah. No, dude, who are you talking about? They're chip nerds.

915
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,080
Speaker 3:  Commenters schooled me on how wrong I was.

916
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,240
Speaker 6:  These are, they're their brains are graphs.

917
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:12,000
Speaker 3:  I, I, I picked up eventually.

918
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:13,600
Speaker 6:  It's like an EKG machine.

919
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,280
Speaker 3:  I don't, but I don't judge 'em because I personally, I just wanna see it

920
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:16,760
Speaker 3:  go up As

921
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:16,880
Speaker 6:  Long

922
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,400
Speaker 7:  As the one number is higher than the other number. That's all that matters.

923
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:19,600
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

924
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,280
Speaker 6:  That is the, the only, I'm just telling you, you look at the track, go on

925
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:26,200
Speaker 6:  apple.com/macbook Pro 14 and 16, like that's not

926
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,640
Speaker 6:  quite the url. But you'll, you'll get there, you'll click on it, you'll understand

927
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,440
Speaker 6:  that I was close enough and you scroll down and you're like, okay, this purple

928
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,280
Speaker 6:  line is 9.4 x compared

929
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:40,080
Speaker 6:  to Intel-based MacBook Pro. And you're like, what does that

930
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:42,480
Speaker 6:  mean? Is it in time?

931
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:47,760
Speaker 6:  Is it in units of performance? Is it in just

932
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,640
Speaker 6:  fast? Is it in smiles? There's not,

933
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:55,600
Speaker 6:  there's not a unit. I'm one assumes it's

934
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,000
Speaker 6:  time, but is it minutes? Is it seconds? Like

935
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:02,960
Speaker 12:  Wait, there's a three, there's a three. There's a, there's a note at the

936
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,930
Speaker 12:  bottom. I'm still scrolling.

937
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:05,530
Speaker 6:  Go ahead.

938
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:09,800
Speaker 12:  I'm still there. Testing can, oh, this is what it's testing on.

939
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:13,600
Speaker 6:  Yeah, no, I read the note dog. It's not

940
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,240
Speaker 6:  gonna help you. Doesn't

941
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,920
Speaker 12:  Say no answers there.

942
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:21,440
Speaker 6:  It's just a list of specs in the, the frame rate of the movie file

943
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,000
Speaker 6:  and the resolution in the file that it transcoded. I I'm just telling you,

944
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,640
Speaker 6:  you it is, it's bold, it's powerful. It's

945
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:32,320
Speaker 6:  avant-garde. It's now to say, you know what NEA yelled at us about the

946
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:36,280
Speaker 6:  YIs for so long, it's killed it. We're taking out the fucking X axis and

947
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,480
Speaker 6:  units fine. Like fine.

948
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:39,960
Speaker 3:  It's

949
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,680
Speaker 6:  Just fast. The next, I guarantee you the next time around it's just gonna

950
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,200
Speaker 6:  be a purple bar with no units. Like, not even this like relative

951
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:46,760
Speaker 6:  9.4.

952
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:47,360
Speaker 3:  I'm just gonna say

953
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:51,160
Speaker 6:  Fast. I'm sure the chip is very fast. I I, again, I

954
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:54,720
Speaker 6:  have a M one Pro MacBook Pro, great computer,

955
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,760
Speaker 6:  best computer I've ever earned. Every time I look at these units, every time

956
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,800
Speaker 6:  I look at these charts, I'm just like furious with

957
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:03,640
Speaker 3:  That. I like that the M one max is faster than the M two

958
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:07,440
Speaker 3:  Pro, but you wouldn't necessarily notice that because it's a different color.

959
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:09,600
Speaker 3:  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And almost the same color as like

960
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,320
Speaker 6:  The background. I'm just, I'm telling you right now, if you just look at

961
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:16,080
Speaker 6:  these charts, oh, that's the other thing. So it's video. They changed

962
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:16,840
Speaker 6:  the comparison

963
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:17,080
Speaker 3:  What

964
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,560
Speaker 6:  Things left a color on 16 inch model, which has the M two max

965
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:24,680
Speaker 6:  is compared against a core I nine and radi on Pro 5,600

966
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,960
Speaker 6:  M. That is the, that bar is one. And then you click to the

967
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,840
Speaker 6:  14 inch model and it's a shorter bar,

968
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:36,410
Speaker 6:  but it's a MacBook Crow with an Intel core I seven and presumably integrated

969
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:40,330
Speaker 6:  graphics. There's just no way to know what's going on

970
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:40,610
Speaker 6:  here.

971
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:42,890
Speaker 3:  I'm loving it.

972
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:44,930
Speaker 6:  Probably still bad at gaming.

973
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,210
Speaker 3:  This is great. Is

974
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,610
Speaker 6:  That's brutal. So they're claiming longest battery life ever in a Mac. The

975
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:57,250
Speaker 6:  16 inch model with the M two PRO is supposed to get

976
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:59,970
Speaker 6:  22 hours in video playback. Which again, we should caveat you should go watch

977
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:03,530
Speaker 6:  Joanna Stern's video. That's with all of the radios off and the brightness

978
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:06,850
Speaker 6:  turned all the along and like looping one video in QuickTime.

979
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:10,970
Speaker 6:  And if that's you, you're getting almost a full day of that

980
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:11,610
Speaker 6:  experience.

981
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:13,130
Speaker 3:  Enjoy.

982
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,850
Speaker 6:  Like let me know if that's you. And then 15 hours of

983
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:20,570
Speaker 6:  wireless web browsing that's supposed to be an hour longer than the previous

984
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:24,570
Speaker 6:  M one Pro, which we got 16 hours out of when we actually did it, which was

985
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:28,450
Speaker 6:  longer than their average. So we're very excited to test the

986
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:31,890
Speaker 6:  battery life on these things. Test the performance again. The chip seems

987
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:35,930
Speaker 6:  great. I think the Mac mini at 5 99, that's, that's, it's getting

988
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:37,890
Speaker 6:  real close to impulse by territory for me.

989
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:38,370
Speaker 3:  That's

990
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:41,250
Speaker 6:  A good, like I don't need that computer and I'm like, Ooh. But that's, it's

991
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:41,930
Speaker 6:  pretty good.

992
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:46,090
Speaker 3:  I like, I don't wanna bully you into buying things, but you should buy

993
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:49,570
Speaker 6:  It. You know, I bullied David Pearson to buying an M one mini. He was like

994
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:51,890
Speaker 6:  complaining about his computer. I was like, dude, it's like 5 99. He was

995
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:52,650
Speaker 6:  like, oh, it's a good deal.

996
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:55,450
Speaker 3:  Just do it. Well and this

997
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:58,170
Speaker 6:  Is the first, so there's a, there's some weirdness here, right? With the

998
00:55:58,170 --> 00:56:02,090
Speaker 6:  Mac Mini? Yeah, the Mac Studio, the forthcoming Mac Pro, which we're now,

999
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:05,370
Speaker 6:  you know, Germin at Bloomberg reported it's gonna be in the same case and

1000
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:09,130
Speaker 6:  there's just some weirdness with that part of the Mac line.

1001
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:13,210
Speaker 6:  But I would tell you that I'm fully accepting of it because

1002
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:16,010
Speaker 6:  Apple's Mac line used to be weird in the wrong way. This

1003
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:16,570
Speaker 3:  Is a good weird,

1004
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:20,050
Speaker 6:  Which is like they clearly hated these products and didn't want you to buy

1005
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:23,360
Speaker 6:  them. And now it's weird in the best way and that there are too many good

1006
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:25,160
Speaker 6:  choices. Like I'll I'll take that.

1007
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:29,040
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Like I have no FOMO about my my Mac studio. Yeah.

1008
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:32,720
Speaker 3:  I feel great. I I didn't look at this MAC Mini and go, oh man I should've

1009
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,440
Speaker 3:  waited another year with my 2012 MacBook Pro.

1010
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:40,240
Speaker 6:  The, the second this thing goes on sale or there's like a good refurb, it's

1011
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,480
Speaker 6:  over. Ugh. Like I'll be like Max, you're not going to college. But the chip

1012
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,720
Speaker 6:  in this computer is named after

1013
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:50,280
Speaker 7:  Hd my 2.1. What were

1014
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:53,520
Speaker 6:  You supposed to do? Yeah, no that's right. Right. I get AK monitor. What's

1015
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,320
Speaker 6:  the only thing I've ever complained about with my MacBook Pro is it have

1016
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:00,080
Speaker 6:  HCA 2.1, do I consistently plug it into a seven 20 P

1017
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:03,800
Speaker 6:  curve monitor Curve TV that I use only for Zoom? I do.

1018
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:07,280
Speaker 6:  But should that be HDMI 2.1? It should, yeah.

1019
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:08,680
Speaker 3:  But you can get the MAC

1020
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,880
Speaker 6:  Mini in general. I mean these are fine refreshes. Here's the weird thing.

1021
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:16,120
Speaker 6:  So they put them out with just kind of like press releases. They

1022
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:19,680
Speaker 6:  both have like long videos with them about the new Mac, the new chips. It

1023
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,320
Speaker 6:  feels like there was supposed to be an event, like this is the cut up of

1024
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,480
Speaker 6:  the event video that we would otherwise see and they just like did it

1025
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:27,240
Speaker 3:  Right

1026
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:31,180
Speaker 6:  And like was there supposed to be an event and they just

1027
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:34,620
Speaker 6:  didn't have, they didn't have the ER glasses or whatever it is and they're

1028
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:35,700
Speaker 6:  like, we're just putting 'em out.

1029
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:39,580
Speaker 3:  Yeah cuz Germin is saying that there was supposed to be an event

1030
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,340
Speaker 3:  and the glasses were gonna be there and now they're like Ugh, the glasses

1031
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:44,300
Speaker 3:  aren't ready. Don't worry about the glasses.

1032
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:47,620
Speaker 6:  I am. Keep going. I'm right now lt, here's what I tell you in my heart, I

1033
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:51,580
Speaker 6:  think AR glasses are in the exact same hype timeline as self-driving

1034
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:51,780
Speaker 6:  cars.

1035
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:52,500
Speaker 3:  Oh I like

1036
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:55,780
Speaker 6:  That. I think we're gonna be a lot older before we see self-driving cars

1037
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:57,180
Speaker 6:  or AR glasses. For real.

1038
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:01,060
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Like it would be wild if, if Apple had solved the

1039
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:04,900
Speaker 3:  display issues with AR or all of the other myriad of issues

1040
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:05,100
Speaker 3:  with

1041
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:07,940
Speaker 6:  Yeah, we've gone through the stack many times in the show. You need to build

1042
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:11,900
Speaker 6:  a display that has sufficient resolution to look like reality. But you

1043
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,700
Speaker 6:  can still see through that mounts on your face and is comfortable to wear.

1044
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:18,460
Speaker 6:  You need to have a processor that can do all of that in real time.

1045
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,420
Speaker 6:  You need to put cameras around that display so you can, the processor can

1046
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:25,340
Speaker 6:  see reality image it and spit out an augmented version of reality

1047
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:28,820
Speaker 6:  on top of it. Then you need to have a battery and then you need to have connectivity

1048
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:32,260
Speaker 6:  and all of it. Can't get too hot and eats last all day. Like good luck. Like

1049
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:34,100
Speaker 6:  we're gonna be a lot older. Yeah.

1050
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:38,100
Speaker 7:  De Coil is never happening. But I don't, I don't know they,

1051
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:41,620
Speaker 7:  it seems like they're kind of close with the $3,000 headset that no one's

1052
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:45,580
Speaker 7:  actually going to buy with an M two chip in it and of VR chip and

1053
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:46,100
Speaker 7:  it's people

1054
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:46,260
Speaker 3:  Are

1055
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,660
Speaker 7:  Gonna buy that something that goes into your back pocket, they're going to

1056
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:49,460
Speaker 7:  buy it and do what?

1057
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:50,980
Speaker 6:  Yeah. No they have the Quest

1058
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,700
Speaker 3:  Pro YouTube videos showing

1059
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:56,500
Speaker 6:  This is the Quest Pro problem. The Quest Pro is this product. Yeah. And maybe

1060
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:00,340
Speaker 6:  it's a little worse than Apple's product. Maybe on some dimension it's a

1061
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:03,820
Speaker 6:  little bit better. Who knows? But it's basically this product, it has worse

1062
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:07,900
Speaker 6:  software, whatever. But you're like, oh this is woo, like the ar

1063
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:10,980
Speaker 6:  pass through of that thing isn't like not good. And like the Metaverse is

1064
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:14,900
Speaker 6:  no fun and the the children are still looking for Addie cuz she was the

1065
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:15,260
Speaker 6:  only girl.

1066
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:21,600
Speaker 6:  We'll we'll see, I but you get the feeling there was supposed to be something

1067
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,440
Speaker 6:  else and this was supposed to be an event and they can't have an event to

1068
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:27,640
Speaker 6:  announce a chip bump in the MacBook Pro. It's like here we are. They can't

1069
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,600
Speaker 6:  have an event to be like the Home pod's back. So they just like put it out.

1070
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,320
Speaker 6:  Oh the home pod's back and it's still the same speaker. Apparent should,

1071
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:38,200
Speaker 6:  we should talk about the HomePod. So those are the Macs. We're M two. They

1072
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,880
Speaker 6:  seem cool. We're excited to test them when we get them. Cool

1073
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:45,600
Speaker 6:  the next day. Another press release, another video.

1074
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:47,440
Speaker 6:  The home pod's back y'all.

1075
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:48,080
Speaker 3:  Woo.

1076
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:54,480
Speaker 6:  And I, I think people were expecting it to be changed more than it

1077
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,120
Speaker 6:  is. No,

1078
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:59,280
Speaker 3:  I, no I don't think anybody was. Cuz all you wanted was thread

1079
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:03,720
Speaker 3:  and to not feel like you're gonna go to jail when you take the court

1080
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:07,640
Speaker 3:  out and now you can take the court out without feeling like

1081
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:08,360
Speaker 3:  you're gonna break something.

1082
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,600
Speaker 6:  The European police are coming for you.

1083
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:10,880
Speaker 3:  Yeah, they are

1084
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,800
Speaker 6:  Right now. So it's 2 99. It looks We have, we

1085
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:18,400
Speaker 6:  have to see them the same. Same. But it looks the same as the original

1086
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,640
Speaker 6:  HomePod. They're saying there's a new color which they're calling midnight.

1087
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:26,200
Speaker 6:  It's, yeah, it's the same. It's, they make, there's a, a white-ish

1088
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,560
Speaker 6:  one and there's a black-ish one. I dunno what to tell you.

1089
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,880
Speaker 6:  Before it was gray, now it's midnight. They've added thread in matter support.

1090
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:37,760
Speaker 6:  Although apples matter support, it's a little rocky right now. Yeah. It has

1091
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,680
Speaker 6:  temperature and humidity sensors. The HomePod Mini also has temperature and

1092
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,840
Speaker 6:  humidity sensors. Those are being enabled now.

1093
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:46,600
Speaker 3:  Which got activated. Yeah. Like those, those HomePod mini sensors got

1094
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:50,040
Speaker 3:  activated with this announcement. Okay. If you have the software update,

1095
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:52,960
Speaker 6:  That's cool. It has worse wifi for some reason.

1096
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,400
Speaker 6:  Deeply confusing. But honestly who cares

1097
01:00:56,430 --> 01:00:57,480
Speaker 3:  Unless tweeters.

1098
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:01,320
Speaker 6:  Right. So the, if you remember the first generation HomePod, I went outside

1099
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:05,280
Speaker 6:  California. I went to Apple's big audio testing facility. It

1100
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,520
Speaker 6:  was, it was a cool day. You know they put, you know they put me in one of

1101
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:11,840
Speaker 6:  those rooms where like, you can't hear anything. Yeah. Are you crazy yet?

1102
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:15,080
Speaker 6:  And I was like, no it's fine. But you know, like everyone, it's like you

1103
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:18,760
Speaker 6:  go to enough events like this and people show you the, they all have the

1104
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:22,200
Speaker 6:  same room with like the foam spikes and you can't hear anything. You're like

1105
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,480
Speaker 6:  yeah, like people have these and they play the speaker for you and they always

1106
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:28,320
Speaker 6:  play Hotel California cuz Apple is at it's heart a boomer company.

1107
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:33,560
Speaker 6:  Yes. It's just real. And so this time and, but the point at the

1108
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:37,280
Speaker 6:  HomePod at that time was that it was the best sounding speaker, right? All

1109
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,920
Speaker 6:  of their emphasis was on speaker stuff. And they had the

1110
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:44,520
Speaker 6:  four inch low excursion woofer.

1111
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:48,120
Speaker 6:  They had seven tweeters. They're doing all this beam forming. They were measuring

1112
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:51,200
Speaker 6:  how far away you were from the wall so they could bounce audio

1113
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:55,600
Speaker 6:  off the wall and send it to you all at the same time and create a bigger

1114
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:59,480
Speaker 6:  stereo sound. Feel they're getting more bass. It was cool. It sounded fine.

1115
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:02,960
Speaker 6:  I would say, I think I, I went back and reread my original HomePod review.

1116
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:07,360
Speaker 6:  You should go watch it. It was very fun to do. I have a lot of speakers in

1117
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,760
Speaker 6:  my house. The whole video team came to my house, like set up all the speakers

1118
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,040
Speaker 6:  everywhere. It was like fun. And our takeaway was, you know, it's like the

1119
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:16,880
Speaker 6:  HomePod that whatever high end Alexa device was back then, the Sonos one,

1120
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:20,520
Speaker 6:  we just had a whole list of, we had a Bluetooth speaker and we're like, of

1121
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:23,400
Speaker 6:  the ones that you think of as the competitors, the HomePod and the Sonos

1122
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:27,200
Speaker 6:  say they sound different. The HomePod wins some, the Sonos wins. Some

1123
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,920
Speaker 6:  others. If you are not comparing them directly side by side,

1124
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:33,920
Speaker 6:  they're indistinguishable. Like you will just be happy with iron. They

1125
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:34,320
Speaker 3:  Both sound nice

1126
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,880
Speaker 6:  And so you should pick the one that fits into the ecosystem of your life.

1127
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:40,960
Speaker 6:  And foremost, people that was not the HomePod, like couldn't do two

1128
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:44,720
Speaker 6:  timers at once, didn't recognize multiple users. Just,

1129
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:48,240
Speaker 6:  it was just weird. It was just a weird product in like the

1130
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,440
Speaker 6:  Sonos products, like Alexa products or whatever else. They were all better

1131
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,320
Speaker 6:  because they were better smart home products. Now the thing's back, I think

1132
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:57,960
Speaker 6:  the HomePod mini has been more of a success than like Apple Times was cheap

1133
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:01,520
Speaker 6:  success, but it's like doing fine. But the hobo itself failed. Now it's back.

1134
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,720
Speaker 6:  They've cut down the tweeters from seven to five.

1135
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:08,320
Speaker 6:  They've cut down the microphones from seven to five.

1136
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:12,280
Speaker 6:  They say it sounds better than the original. We gotta do a head-to-head

1137
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:16,880
Speaker 6:  all the same beam forming, processings, whatever. We'll see. But the real

1138
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,760
Speaker 6:  thing is like matter support is there thread support is there, home kit has

1139
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:24,080
Speaker 6:  been improved. Siri can set two timers at once. Now I think

1140
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,590
Speaker 6:  is that, is that enough?

1141
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:29,430
Speaker 3:  Only when it remembers to be connected to the internet, which

1142
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:32,630
Speaker 3:  it still sometimes is. Like, I'm not connected to the internet even while

1143
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:36,070
Speaker 3:  it's playing your music. So it won't stop your music because it doesn't think

1144
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:38,910
Speaker 3:  it's connected to the internet. That just happened yesterday. Sorry, I'm

1145
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:39,430
Speaker 3:  really heated about

1146
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:42,030
Speaker 6:  It. Oh, I'm sorry. It is slightly different in terms of design. It's a little

1147
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:45,310
Speaker 6:  shorter. It's 0.2 inches shorter and it weighs

1148
01:03:45,310 --> 01:03:49,070
Speaker 6:  5.16 pounds instead of 5.5. But that's what you get when you lose two tweeters

1149
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:49,430
Speaker 6:  in two minutes. I

1150
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:52,470
Speaker 7:  Feel like we saw the same thing with the original Google Home and then the

1151
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:55,190
Speaker 7:  speaker that they came out with after that that like the first one was slightly

1152
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:58,030
Speaker 7:  over-engineered in terms of what they were able to do with the audio, with

1153
01:03:58,030 --> 01:04:01,070
Speaker 7:  the hardwood that they had in it. And then the second one, they took a lot

1154
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:04,590
Speaker 7:  of that out. They said, yeah, we don't really need all of these parts. Yeah,

1155
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:07,470
Speaker 7:  we, we can, we can sell the people who are going to buy these. Don't care

1156
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:10,030
Speaker 7:  if it's five or seven. Yeah. So we'll just go with five.

1157
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:14,230
Speaker 6:  Well here's what I know. Yeah. Every tech company, when they sell you, when

1158
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:17,230
Speaker 6:  they sell their first speaker, like people care about sign quality

1159
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:21,150
Speaker 6:  and then they try really hard and God bless them

1160
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:23,710
Speaker 6:  baby's first speaker, you gonna try really hard. And they ship to speaker

1161
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:27,510
Speaker 6:  and he turns out people care about his convenience and price and

1162
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:31,150
Speaker 6:  people will throw away sound quality at the drop of a hat. And I think that's

1163
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:33,950
Speaker 6:  very much been the experience of the HomePod. And now they're here. There's

1164
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:37,510
Speaker 6:  some TV stuff that's good Richard. So it can pair with an Apple tv.

1165
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:39,830
Speaker 6:  Apple TV's not support er. So

1166
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,990
Speaker 6:  in a bizarre signal chain, you can plug your Apple TV

1167
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:48,550
Speaker 6:  into your smart tv, plug your PS five into your smart tv,

1168
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:52,950
Speaker 6:  have the PS five, send audio to the tv, the tv, send audio back

1169
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:56,550
Speaker 6:  out to the Apple TV over er, the Apple tv, then send the audio

1170
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:00,230
Speaker 6:  to your Apple Home pods. And then you listen to your PS five

1171
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,230
Speaker 6:  on your home pods.

1172
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,190
Speaker 3:  Or you could just buy a receiver.

1173
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:04,070
Speaker 7:  The latency,

1174
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:09,790
Speaker 6:  I mean, yeah, the receiver crew rise up,

1175
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:10,230
Speaker 6:  you know,

1176
01:05:10,930 --> 01:05:13,710
Speaker 3:  But with an pl with airplay too in it. And boom,

1177
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:17,030
Speaker 6:  Done. People like using their home pods with their Apple TVs. And now with

1178
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:20,920
Speaker 6:  with er, you can eat your game consoles. E even could get, you have an

1179
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:24,560
Speaker 6:  Apple TV plug in your smart TV and you're somehow using a smart TV app,

1180
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:27,440
Speaker 6:  sending the audio out from ER through an Apple TV to your HomePod.

1181
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,360
Speaker 3:  Oh my gosh, that's just

1182
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:31,080
Speaker 6:  Nasty. Just email us. I wanna know who you are and how you've come to that

1183
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:32,600
Speaker 6:  position in your life.

1184
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,000
Speaker 6:  Dying to know. There

1185
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,920
Speaker 7:  Was a discussion about where you were going to put speakers and the only

1186
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:42,720
Speaker 7:  thing that someone would let you put was two home pods that no one can see.

1187
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:47,080
Speaker 3:  Oh, I know why they would do that. Because for the longest time

1188
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:50,640
Speaker 3:  you, the Apple TV didn't do like

1189
01:05:50,850 --> 01:05:54,840
Speaker 3:  4K hdr Dolby Vision. I think it was 4K Dolby vision on Amazon Prime.

1190
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:57,120
Speaker 3:  So you could only do that with the native,

1191
01:05:57,140 --> 01:05:57,920
Speaker 6:  But it does it now

1192
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,520
Speaker 3:  Smart TV apps. But maybe that person

1193
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,040
Speaker 3:  hasn't updated their Apple

1194
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:06,400
Speaker 6:  Tv, but somehow they've updated it to the, the only, the new ones I have.

1195
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:06,720
Speaker 6:  Er

1196
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,360
Speaker 3:  Look, I don't know this person's life

1197
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:11,480
Speaker 7:  They've made, they've made some choices.

1198
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:15,880
Speaker 6:  And then lastly, the HomePod supports spatial audio. Toby Atmos,

1199
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:19,680
Speaker 6:  I'm just gonna say this out loud directly, full

1200
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:23,400
Speaker 6:  honesty, full transparency. HomePod announcement comes out, I'm like, oh,

1201
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,040
Speaker 6:  HomePod, I love speakers. Read about the speakers, read about spa audio.

1202
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:29,400
Speaker 6:  Everyone's excited. I have an atmos, I have a real receiver

1203
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:33,320
Speaker 6:  5.2 0.2 set, big, the whole thing. I'm like, I'm

1204
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:37,200
Speaker 6:  listen to some Atmos music. Cue up Apple Music on the Apple

1205
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:41,120
Speaker 6:  tv, pick their spatial audio show off playlist list. It fucking

1206
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:45,040
Speaker 6:  sucks. Spatial audio sucks. It's horrible and I

1207
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:47,040
Speaker 6:  hate it. It's the worst.

1208
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:47,960
Speaker 3:  Why does

1209
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:51,280
Speaker 6:  It suck? Because it removes all the impact for music.

1210
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:55,080
Speaker 6:  Because everyone's drunk on having so many channels. It's

1211
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:55,520
Speaker 3:  Sneaking up on you.

1212
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:59,200
Speaker 6:  They spread everything out. And so everything, like you just have this

1213
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:03,040
Speaker 6:  massive sound stage for no reason. You don't need it. And like all the

1214
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:06,800
Speaker 6:  bottom end, all the impact, all the presence is like deleted.

1215
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:10,440
Speaker 6:  And it just, every single time it sounds worse

1216
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:14,600
Speaker 6:  in particular on the low end, it texted somebody who would know and

1217
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,880
Speaker 6:  they're like, yo, yeah, you gotta turn your sub's way up if you're listening

1218
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,680
Speaker 6:  to Atmos. And it's like, what? Because to compensate for like the

1219
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:24,480
Speaker 6:  drunk sound engineers of Hollywood being like, put it in all the channels

1220
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:28,600
Speaker 6:  instead of concentrating it into stereo channels. The one

1221
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:32,200
Speaker 6:  Atmos track I listened to yesterday on this person's recommendation was boom

1222
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:36,040
Speaker 6:  by tto. It was awesome. I will admit this was awesome because

1223
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:39,920
Speaker 6:  it is a high energy dance track with lots of beeps and boobs and

1224
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:43,560
Speaker 6:  it was clearly made to fuck with people on drugs and the beeps and boobs

1225
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:47,400
Speaker 6:  just swirl around you in like an ever oh, ever escalating

1226
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:50,720
Speaker 6:  sound field. And I was like, if I was on drugs, this would rule, like this

1227
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:54,640
Speaker 6:  would be the best experience in my life. And that was the only one. It sucks.

1228
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:57,640
Speaker 6:  I don't like, why do we have to keep lying about spatial audio being any

1229
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:01,080
Speaker 6:  good? I don't know anybody who likes it. We don't. I ask music executives,

1230
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:04,080
Speaker 6:  do you think it's good? And I'm like, it's getting better.

1231
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:08,200
Speaker 3:  Tim Cook just standing behind them. We

1232
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:11,920
Speaker 6:  Had Charlie Harding on Decoder. That's a fun episode. We talked about

1233
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,320
Speaker 6:  music and street, Taylor Swift, all this stuff. And he was like, the only

1234
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:18,280
Speaker 6:  reason Apple is this invested in spatial is because

1235
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:22,160
Speaker 6:  they need it for all their ar metaverse play that

1236
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:25,800
Speaker 6:  they're, they're trying to do. Right? So they they need all these extra channels

1237
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:29,400
Speaker 6:  in the music. They need spatial audio so that when they put you in the, the

1238
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:32,920
Speaker 6:  virtual reality or they put you in AR and all this stuff and you're

1239
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:37,080
Speaker 6:  moving around, they can manipulate the music properly. And like

1240
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:38,080
Speaker 6:  maybe I believe that

1241
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:42,480
Speaker 3:  Wait is, is Apple's ar killer

1242
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,240
Speaker 3:  app gonna be like going to concerts?

1243
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:49,120
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So it's like if you do, if you have a good spatial mix and Apple puts

1244
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,240
Speaker 6:  you in like a Metaverse concert or whatever, they already have the content.

1245
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:55,560
Speaker 6:  Yeah. More importantly, they've already built like the spatial audio

1246
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,480
Speaker 6:  pipelines and the processing into their consumer devices and

1247
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:03,080
Speaker 6:  AirPods and whatever, right? Like they've built an ecosystem around spatial

1248
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:06,520
Speaker 6:  audio so that when that stuff is there, there's content, there's user experience,

1249
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:09,280
Speaker 6:  there's lots of people know how to use the tools like it's primed and ready

1250
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:12,400
Speaker 6:  in the best Apple way. That's Apple's very good at sort of like stepping

1251
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:15,880
Speaker 6:  you up layer by layer and then launching the device that adds it all up.

1252
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:18,720
Speaker 6:  I'm just like, but right now it sucks. Look,

1253
01:09:19,650 --> 01:09:23,160
Speaker 6:  it, this is like a, it's like a real deal at most system.

1254
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:27,280
Speaker 6:  It's, it's, I was like, this sucks. Like this is making my stereo sound

1255
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:30,080
Speaker 6:  bad. Yeah. And I tried it. Get headphones like these make my headphones.

1256
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:33,960
Speaker 6:  I don't know if you love facial audio, let let me know. But I, I think there's

1257
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:37,720
Speaker 6:  a reason it's always demoed with like live recordings of the Eagles.

1258
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:39,240
Speaker 6:  Mm. Because like one,

1259
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:39,880
Speaker 3:  That's all

1260
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:43,000
Speaker 6:  I listen to is the reporters get, is the influencers and reporters get younger,

1261
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,800
Speaker 6:  they have no idea what they're listening to. And you can just be like kids

1262
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:50,840
Speaker 6:  back in the day, Don Henley, you know Don Henley is

1263
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:55,800
Speaker 6:  listen to those guitar talents man. And they're like a guitar and like, fine,

1264
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:59,960
Speaker 6:  we used to have bands, right? It's like an you can just confuse people by

1265
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:03,040
Speaker 6:  playing the Eagles at them, but I'm just telling you, turn it off and just

1266
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:06,960
Speaker 6:  listen to how much more impact like literal impact music has when it's off

1267
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:10,560
Speaker 6:  versus on and you're like, why? What am I gaining? And the answer is nothing.

1268
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:13,120
Speaker 6:  Sorry, I'm just ranting on spa audio now. It's horrible.

1269
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:15,240
Speaker 3:  I like, I I haven't turned it on and on.

1270
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:18,120
Speaker 7:  Get get it off you obviously you, you have feelings about this. We're here

1271
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:18,360
Speaker 7:  for you.

1272
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:20,680
Speaker 6:  It's just therapy about spatial

1273
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:23,920
Speaker 6:  si. Alright. How

1274
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:24,320
Speaker 3:  Does it make

1275
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,320
Speaker 6:  You feel? Oh, Liam's says spatial. There are some other home pods. See Liam's.

1276
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:30,120
Speaker 6:  Liam's. Liam wanted us to talk about the HomePod. Liam, do you have any thoughts

1277
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,550
Speaker 6:  about the HomePod to add here? Thes? No.

1278
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:37,880
Speaker 6:  All right, I'm gonna come down. We should talk about two more

1279
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:40,560
Speaker 6:  things. We're talk about Netflix or Microsoft first. We gotta get through

1280
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:40,760
Speaker 6:  'em.

1281
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:42,160
Speaker 3:  Let's do Netflix real fast.

1282
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,160
Speaker 6:  Yeah. All right. Richard, tell us what's going on with

1283
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:47,880
Speaker 7:  Netflix. Netflix for the first time in, I guess, ever

1284
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:52,240
Speaker 7:  has a CEO that is not Reid Hastings in, in, at least as long as I can remember,

1285
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:52,440
Speaker 7:  in

1286
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:52,840
Speaker 3:  Co ceo,

1287
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:56,720
Speaker 7:  Two co CEOs because in 2020, Reid added

1288
01:10:56,720 --> 01:11:00,680
Speaker 7:  Co C Coco, he added Ted Sereno who kind of runs the content

1289
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:04,760
Speaker 7:  business a as his as his co c o. And now today

1290
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:08,200
Speaker 7:  on on Thursday sixth, we're recording this, Reid announced that he's stepping

1291
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:12,080
Speaker 7:  down as as co c o and elevating Greg Peters, who was the chief

1292
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:16,000
Speaker 7:  operating officer who will now be Coco around along with Sarandos. And

1293
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,760
Speaker 7:  the timing of this is really interesting because this is at the exact same

1294
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,880
Speaker 7:  time that Netflix is just starting to roll out two things that Reid Hastings

1295
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,840
Speaker 7:  does not like advertisements and kind of their,

1296
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:30,720
Speaker 7:  their pushback against password sharing, which for all, for the many years

1297
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,560
Speaker 7:  of them building up streaming, he's been saying password sharing. It's not

1298
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:36,200
Speaker 7:  that bad. It doesn't, it doesn't really affect us. He's been saying we won't

1299
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:40,160
Speaker 7:  do ads. Those two things have changed. And now Reid Hastings is an executive

1300
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:44,000
Speaker 7:  chairman and, and kind of some will be in, in much less of an active

1301
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,960
Speaker 7:  role. And now, now it's relying on the, these, these two men, as Netflix

1302
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:51,880
Speaker 7:  becomes a very different company, they now have hundreds of millions of subscribers.

1303
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:55,560
Speaker 7:  They're trying to get into gaming. They maybe can't find new

1304
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:58,400
Speaker 7:  customers and they're trying to find ways to make more money from the customers

1305
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:01,160
Speaker 7:  that they have. And that that is the struggle that they have and the, the

1306
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:04,240
Speaker 7:  case that they're making to Wall Street is how profitable they are versus

1307
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:07,800
Speaker 7:  their competitors who are spending and losing money, handover fist, trying

1308
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:11,640
Speaker 7:  to build up a, a subscriber base and content like Netflix has

1309
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:15,560
Speaker 7:  and, and apps, I guess let's not even get into how all the other

1310
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:18,880
Speaker 7:  apps are. Netflix isn't that great and every other app is worth Yeah.

1311
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:22,840
Speaker 7:  But the, the tech platform, the content, everything about it,

1312
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:26,120
Speaker 7:  they haven't really matched up to Netflix yet. And they're spending, so they're

1313
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:28,880
Speaker 7:  setting money on fire to try and catch, to try and catch Netflix. And that

1314
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:31,360
Speaker 7:  that is what Netflix brings up every earnings cost that they're profitable

1315
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:34,260
Speaker 7:  and the others are not. But that's what they've got.

1316
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:38,090
Speaker 3:  I mean, Netflix set money on fire for years

1317
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:41,850
Speaker 7:  That, that's been their whole thing until now when that was no longer

1318
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:42,690
Speaker 7:  advantageous.

1319
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:45,570
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And, and we've, we saw that they, they they've been doing a slew of

1320
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:49,250
Speaker 3:  cancellations. They've been much more mercenary about what shows

1321
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:53,570
Speaker 3:  get extended in, what shows don't. And I think they were

1322
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:57,290
Speaker 3:  even doing like unexpected cancellations, like pulling stuff. They'd already

1323
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:58,050
Speaker 3:  green lit and stuff

1324
01:12:58,050 --> 01:13:01,330
Speaker 7:  Shows that, that people really liked and that that seemed to do well suddenly

1325
01:13:01,330 --> 01:13:04,690
Speaker 7:  disappear. And I, I think it's, it's interesting to me thinking about the

1326
01:13:04,690 --> 01:13:08,410
Speaker 7:  history of Netflix streaming and where we went from when Netflix watch

1327
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:12,210
Speaker 7:  instantly had kind of the b list of shows that no one had ever

1328
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:15,090
Speaker 7:  heard of and movies. And it was really interesting though. I liked it. And

1329
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:18,290
Speaker 7:  then they started making content. They had that werewolf show and then they

1330
01:13:18,290 --> 01:13:22,050
Speaker 7:  had House of Cards and then it just kind of zoomed from there. And now they

1331
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:25,930
Speaker 7:  have a trillion things and nothing to watch. And you can't start

1332
01:13:25,930 --> 01:13:29,730
Speaker 7:  any new show because you know, it won't get to a second season. And the algorithm

1333
01:13:29,730 --> 01:13:33,490
Speaker 7:  that Netflix was so famous for, it would find something for you that you

1334
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:37,450
Speaker 7:  would watch. Everyone hates it because you can't just find the thing you're

1335
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:40,170
Speaker 7:  looking for. It won't show you. You can't just go through the categories

1336
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:44,090
Speaker 7:  and no, and no one's happy again. We, we all cut the cable and now we

1337
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:44,770
Speaker 7:  have us streaming.

1338
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:49,930
Speaker 6:  Yeah. See Richard has feelings about Netflix, like, keep going.

1339
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,450
Speaker 3:  I was like, Ooh, keep going Richard. This

1340
01:13:52,450 --> 01:13:55,890
Speaker 7:  Is, this is, this is my life. This is a, it's, it's, it's a moment, man.

1341
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:59,050
Speaker 7:  This is when, when I, when I saw this come across, I was like, wait, is this

1342
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:02,370
Speaker 7:  really happening? Because I, I've kind of been anticipating it. We had so

1343
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:04,930
Speaker 7:  many tech execs go away and I was like, yeah, Reid's gonna be the next one

1344
01:14:04,930 --> 01:14:06,690
Speaker 7:  and now it's here. And I, I don't even know how to do. Yeah.

1345
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:09,410
Speaker 6:  So in his resignation note, he calls out Bill Gates,

1346
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,600
Speaker 6:  Jeff Bezos, right. Moving up to executive chairman,

1347
01:14:13,170 --> 01:14:16,720
Speaker 6:  piecing out, handing the reins over. But usually you do that

1348
01:14:16,850 --> 01:14:20,720
Speaker 6:  at the top. I wanna say like, Netflix isn't a

1349
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:24,520
Speaker 6:  challenging position and the things you called out, the changes it has to

1350
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:27,360
Speaker 6:  make password sharing, adding advertising are things that he did not want

1351
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:30,560
Speaker 6:  to do. So you have to wonder if he's just like, eh, I don't wanna do these

1352
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:30,720
Speaker 6:  things.

1353
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:34,800
Speaker 3:  But there are things that the c the NewCo CEO was

1354
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:38,760
Speaker 3:  doing, like he was in charge of these, these initiatives and so now he's

1355
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:41,200
Speaker 3:  coming in to like finish the job.

1356
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:45,400
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I mean I, I do wonder, and we, we don't know, and

1357
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,720
Speaker 6:  I'm sure there'll be more reporting, but fundamentally Ted Sandos is the

1358
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:52,360
Speaker 6:  content ceo, the Hollywood ceo, and Reid has been the product ceo.

1359
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:55,520
Speaker 6:  Right. And it's interesting that he was like, we still need a product ceo.

1360
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:59,640
Speaker 6:  So it's this person, not, we're a Hollywood company that runs a tech

1361
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:03,720
Speaker 6:  platform, which is very flexy in its way. But you have to wonder if

1362
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:06,840
Speaker 6:  the future of the product roadmap around ad you know, they, they have a big

1363
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:09,720
Speaker 6:  partnership with Microsoft to deliver this advertising. The future of their

1364
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:13,640
Speaker 6:  product roadmap is not the recommendation algorithm. It's

1365
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:17,200
Speaker 6:  not this other stuff. It's like adding ads, it's detecting

1366
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,960
Speaker 6:  password sharing, it's figuring out how to make people open Netflix on their

1367
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,480
Speaker 6:  phones so they can play mobile games and like maybe Reid's like, I don't

1368
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:25,200
Speaker 6:  wanna do it. It's

1369
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,240
Speaker 3:  Real tech-heavy stuff.

1370
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:27,520
Speaker 7:  They, they've become Comcast.

1371
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:29,080
Speaker 6:  That's a bruiser.

1372
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:32,640
Speaker 7:  This is the same stuff that Comcast was doing 10, 12 years ago. They were

1373
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,160
Speaker 7:  like, you

1374
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:37,000
Speaker 6:  Gonna put games in podcast? Fine, Richard, I I'll do the disclosures. Oh,

1375
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:37,880
Speaker 7:  Is that your

1376
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:41,840
Speaker 6:  Disclosure? I am the EP of a Netflix show. It's called The Future of

1377
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:44,400
Speaker 6:  You Should Watch It. I'm heavily biased in favor of that show.

1378
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:49,240
Speaker 6:  That's true. And then Comcast's NBC Universal Division is

1379
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:52,720
Speaker 6:  a minority investor in Vini, the ver parent company. The end.

1380
01:15:52,950 --> 01:15:56,320
Speaker 6:  I also read a book about HBO last week. It was good. What what do you want

1381
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:56,560
Speaker 6:  from me?

1382
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:57,440
Speaker 3:  You wrote a book.

1383
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:00,720
Speaker 6:  You read a book. I read a book I like, wow. It's called, it's not tv. It's

1384
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:03,160
Speaker 6:  very good. We're gonna have the authors on decoder soon. It's great. I highly

1385
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:06,600
Speaker 6:  recommend it. Those are all the disclosures. Do we have anymore, I invented

1386
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:10,440
Speaker 6:  something called the Go 90 Scale of Tomb Streaming Services because

1387
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:16,280
Speaker 3:  I was like, we've, we've cruised through like most

1388
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:18,920
Speaker 7:  Of the big ones. But you didn't invent it for Quickster because we should,

1389
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:21,480
Speaker 7:  we should say that we, we we should, we should bring up Quickster. It's,

1390
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:22,160
Speaker 7:  it's a day to to

1391
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:25,920
Speaker 6:  All right, go ahead. Talk, talk about, talk about Reed's greatest failure.

1392
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:30,600
Speaker 7:  It's a little mean, isn't it? But we'll go there. It, it was the

1393
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:34,480
Speaker 7:  last time Netflix messed up when they decided they were gonna split up

1394
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:38,440
Speaker 7:  streaming in disks. And I, I remember I, I got a phone

1395
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:42,080
Speaker 7:  call like at like 11:00 PM that they were gonna do this thing and it was

1396
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:45,960
Speaker 7:  insane. And then they didn't do it. They, they rolled it

1397
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:49,160
Speaker 7:  all back because everyone hated it. The subscriber numbers dropped and for

1398
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:52,240
Speaker 7:  10 years it was just up, up, up until last year when it wasn't.

1399
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:56,960
Speaker 7:  And now Reid is gone. Yeah. And, and I just, I

1400
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:59,120
Speaker 7:  don't know what Netflix is gonna feel like, you know, a couple of years down

1401
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:02,160
Speaker 7:  the road as you're saying, they, they have a new product lead that is not

1402
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:05,000
Speaker 7:  Reid Hastings. And that just hasn't been the case throughout any of the things

1403
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,400
Speaker 7:  that we've talked about for Netflix. Everything, the way that it's organized,

1404
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:12,160
Speaker 7:  the entire kind of idea about how Netflix is and what it is,

1405
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:14,080
Speaker 7:  is not going to be different then.

1406
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:18,120
Speaker 3:  Well, I mean, they've been, the, the new co c o has been groomed for

1407
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:20,600
Speaker 3:  this. We were seeing him in a lot more of the earnings calls in the last

1408
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:24,560
Speaker 3:  year or so. Like they knew this was coming. They knew he was probably

1409
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:27,880
Speaker 3:  gonna be taking on this role. So I, I anticipate in the couple of next couple

1410
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:31,440
Speaker 3:  of years, there's not gonna be really significant changes from what we've

1411
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:35,120
Speaker 3:  already seen, which is killing password sharing and adding advertising.

1412
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:39,280
Speaker 3:  Like I think we're gonna continue to see Netflix do its thing where it struggles

1413
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:43,120
Speaker 3:  with the, with its viewers and in this whole idea of like, we can't like

1414
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,720
Speaker 3:  a show because it's gonna get canceled unless it's the most popular show,

1415
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:48,600
Speaker 3:  in which case it'll probably be fine. And they're, they're gonna have to

1416
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:51,720
Speaker 3:  deal with that. But ultimately, like they're gonna just continue to print

1417
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:54,760
Speaker 3:  money probably on the go 90 scale. They're like at a 10.

1418
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:55,520
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

1419
01:17:55,550 --> 01:17:58,680
Speaker 7:  I agree with you. And I think you're probably right, but two years ago, Bob

1420
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:02,040
Speaker 7:  Chap probably thought the same thing. Where is he now?

1421
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,840
Speaker 7:  Seriously? Where is he now? He can find it

1422
01:18:05,290 --> 01:18:06,960
Speaker 3:  On the beach. Hey, join himself.

1423
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:10,720
Speaker 6:  Tiger is facing down an activist investor right now named Nelson

1424
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:15,040
Speaker 6:  Peltz at Disney. We, you should just Google it and read

1425
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:18,720
Speaker 6:  the slide deck that Disney filed to, to beat this activist

1426
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,640
Speaker 6:  investor back. They're like, you know nothing about us, you know nothing

1427
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:25,000
Speaker 6:  about television and you're a dummy. And like that's the slide deck.

1428
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:28,440
Speaker 6:  It's a very, you could tell they had a good time putting it together, but

1429
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:31,840
Speaker 6:  all is not well in streaming world, just like across the board.

1430
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:36,120
Speaker 6:  And I think Reid is like, screw it, I dragged this into

1431
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:40,000
Speaker 6:  existence and I'll still be around but I, you know,

1432
01:18:40,030 --> 01:18:43,360
Speaker 6:  I, I'm gonna do whatever Bezos is doing. I'm gonna get yoked and do a, and

1433
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:46,680
Speaker 6:  do a rocket. Like let's do it. I'm like

1434
01:18:46,870 --> 01:18:47,360
Speaker 6:  just

1435
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:48,120
Speaker 3:  Shredded. I

1436
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:52,000
Speaker 6:  Gotta say I see the appeal like my, I'm the

1437
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:52,680
Speaker 6:  executive chairman,

1438
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:56,000
Speaker 3:  His suits aren't gonna close anymore. He's just gonna be so buff.

1439
01:18:56,550 --> 01:19:00,000
Speaker 6:  I love this. I need to buy a $10,000 black t-shirt that makes my arms look

1440
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,640
Speaker 6:  great. And then we can move on to the next thing. Speaking of the next thing,

1441
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:07,240
Speaker 6:  big Microsoft News this week they're laying off 10,000 people, which is very

1442
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:11,200
Speaker 6:  sad. Yeah. Condolences to them. It's the second biggest

1443
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:15,000
Speaker 6:  layoffs in Microsoft history. The first biggest also

1444
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:19,000
Speaker 6:  Sasha Nadela, he led a 14,000 people when he shuttered

1445
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:21,560
Speaker 6:  the sort of Windows phone division and sent

1446
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:25,480
Speaker 6:  12,500 Noki employees away. He got rid of it. So

1447
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:29,160
Speaker 6:  kind of a different context, right? This is the economy's bad. Second biggest

1448
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:33,080
Speaker 6:  layoffs. The biggest layoffs where he shuttered an entire division and got

1449
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:36,280
Speaker 6:  rid of a company. So a little bit context but huge, right?

1450
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:36,960
Speaker 3:  This was across

1451
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:40,640
Speaker 6:  The board, but Microsoft has 220,000 people. So not massive. He published

1452
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:44,200
Speaker 6:  a letter. So there, and there's this paragraph in his note that I think is

1453
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:47,600
Speaker 6:  just really interesting. I'm like worth pulling apart focus on. So he says

1454
01:19:47,730 --> 01:19:51,280
Speaker 6:  we have to continue investing strategic areas for a future. These are the

1455
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:54,320
Speaker 6:  kinds of hard choices we have made through our 47 year history to remain

1456
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:58,000
Speaker 6:  a consequential company in this industry that is unforgiving to

1457
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,640
Speaker 6:  anyone who does not adapt to platform shifts. Which is a really

1458
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:05,560
Speaker 6:  fascinating thing about in the context of Nadella and Microsoft and

1459
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:09,160
Speaker 6:  mobile in the last platform shift they missed, right? And then he said, this

1460
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:12,520
Speaker 6:  is the very next sentence, we're taking 1.2 billion charge

1461
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:16,240
Speaker 6:  related to severance cost changes to our hardware portfolio

1462
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:20,720
Speaker 6:  and the cost of lease consolidation as we they do return to office.

1463
01:20:21,450 --> 01:20:25,360
Speaker 6:  So he's saying he thinks there's a platform shift and they have

1464
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:29,000
Speaker 6:  to change something to get there. And then they're changing their hardware

1465
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,440
Speaker 3:  Portfolio, which we'd already started to

1466
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:33,600
Speaker 6:  See then. Yeah, I don't know what he thinks the platform shift is. And I

1467
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,320
Speaker 6:  asked around and Tom asked around, and you would think

1468
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:41,080
Speaker 6:  that this hardware portfolio change would be shutting down HoloLens

1469
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:44,680
Speaker 6:  cuz they have effectively shut down HoloLens. And if you'll remember,

1470
01:20:45,150 --> 01:20:47,960
Speaker 6:  Nadela was on stage with Zuckerberg saying they were gonna put software on

1471
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:50,160
Speaker 6:  the Quest Pro. So you would think that like what they're talking about is

1472
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:54,160
Speaker 6:  shutting down hos. We asked around and it's not, it's more than that,

1473
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:55,200
Speaker 6:  right? Like

1474
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:59,400
Speaker 3:  Well they also close, they they they're not doing another version of the

1475
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,120
Speaker 3:  duo, right? Like they got rid of the phone.

1476
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:05,120
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So is it it that's the surface line. So are they gonna change the surface

1477
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:08,520
Speaker 6:  line or are they gonna change the Xbox line

1478
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:12,760
Speaker 6:  or are they gonna pair back whatever they're doing in Surface?

1479
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:16,880
Speaker 6:  And then you put that in the context of platform shift, right? We have to

1480
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,280
Speaker 6:  adapt to the platform to remain a consequential company

1481
01:21:20,630 --> 01:21:24,240
Speaker 6:  that has to adapt to platform shifts. We have to do this thing.

1482
01:21:24,430 --> 01:21:28,000
Speaker 6:  Okay, what platform shift and is selling

1483
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:32,320
Speaker 6:  surface Windows laptops enough to remain consequential through a

1484
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:35,160
Speaker 6:  platform shift there? I'm just telling you that paragraph, it just jumped

1485
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:36,000
Speaker 6:  off the page at me.

1486
01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:37,120
Speaker 3:  It's super weird

1487
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:40,800
Speaker 6:  That Microsoft is making some kind of bet that we can't see

1488
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:43,600
Speaker 6:  and maybe that bet's just ai, right? They have a huge investment in open

1489
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,920
Speaker 6:  ai. Again, maybe chat G V T is gonna save Bing.

1490
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:51,040
Speaker 6:  Maybe it's cybersecurity. They, they've talked about that a lot. Maybe it's

1491
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:54,840
Speaker 6:  more Azure work that's Ella's favorite thing in the entire world.

1492
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:58,800
Speaker 6:  Like it, it might be something more obvious, but they're saying

1493
01:21:59,210 --> 01:22:02,920
Speaker 6:  we think there's a platform shift and we have to change our hardware. We're

1494
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:06,000
Speaker 6:  we've preemptively shut down a hardware portfolio. And like I said, Tom and

1495
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,760
Speaker 6:  I both went and asked, rounded some reporting cuz we we're like, oh, it's

1496
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:13,380
Speaker 6:  HoloLens like let's confirm that. No, it's more than that.

1497
01:22:14,410 --> 01:22:18,300
Speaker 7:  What the only thing that I can think of that we haven't mentioned is

1498
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:22,140
Speaker 7:  them putting stuff like obviously O Office has moved to the cloud, we've

1499
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:25,860
Speaker 7:  had the Office 365 huge shift, but windows are suddenly in the cloud. If

1500
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:29,740
Speaker 7:  they're thinking that like the kind of concept of the personal PC license

1501
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:30,620
Speaker 7:  is going away.

1502
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:34,360
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Oh that's interesting. Or Xbox in the cloud, right? They're gonna stream

1503
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:37,840
Speaker 6:  the games to you. They've thought about this a lot. They've got, you know,

1504
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:41,440
Speaker 6:  if they can break through the regulatory barriers and get the European

1505
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:45,200
Speaker 6:  police to let Apple do game streaming. Yeah. Like maybe there's a lot

1506
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:45,840
Speaker 6:  here that you can,

1507
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,000
Speaker 3:  If they can get the internet better.

1508
01:22:47,190 --> 01:22:48,720
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Internet's better. They're

1509
01:22:48,870 --> 01:22:50,520
Speaker 3:  Like, they've got a bunch of hurdles

1510
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:53,920
Speaker 6:  But not in Europe. Yeah. The Internet's a great in Europe, right? And it's

1511
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:57,800
Speaker 6:  just our country that seems destined to do monopoly

1512
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:00,880
Speaker 6:  internet access disclosure. Comcast is a minority investor.

1513
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:11,590
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I just think it's fascinating like that line and

1514
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:14,350
Speaker 6:  we've, we've seen it, you know, all these other, there's lots of tech layoffs

1515
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:18,030
Speaker 6:  across tech industry except for Google and no one's, no one's seen that coming

1516
01:23:18,030 --> 01:23:19,910
Speaker 6:  for Google. I maintained that. This is gonna be weird. Well,

1517
01:23:19,910 --> 01:23:23,630
Speaker 7:  Google had, like, they have sort of had layoffs. They cut back a lot of those

1518
01:23:23,630 --> 01:23:27,310
Speaker 7:  experimental projects. We know that they've put people on kind of these

1519
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:30,670
Speaker 7:  plans where, you know, you need to find another job within Google. They've

1520
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:34,550
Speaker 7:  cut hiring. Apple also has, has kind of done the same thing where they haven't

1521
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:38,030
Speaker 7:  done the massive playoff, but they did slow down hiring over the last like

1522
01:23:38,030 --> 01:23:41,830
Speaker 7:  year or so. So in, in kind of a, a stealth way. They, they all have

1523
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:45,550
Speaker 7:  have gone through that and, but what this reminds me of is the meta layoffs

1524
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:48,910
Speaker 7:  just because it was so huge and it was affecting so many departments and

1525
01:23:48,910 --> 01:23:51,190
Speaker 7:  it feels like kind of everything got cut back.

1526
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:55,150
Speaker 6:  Yeah, we'll see again, you know, Microsoft I think has more focus

1527
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:59,130
Speaker 6:  than meta. Like Microsoft knows what it's selling right now.

1528
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:03,450
Speaker 6:  It's just this line about platform shift. Just like what what's c c in No

1529
01:24:03,450 --> 01:24:07,130
Speaker 6:  one else sees what's the, I don't see a platform, if you were to go up to

1530
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:09,650
Speaker 6:  the, the average Vergecast listener and say what's the next platform shift?

1531
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:13,650
Speaker 6:  I'm guessing most people in their cars just like yelled out like

1532
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:17,610
Speaker 6:  ar like vr, like it's, that's what we've been told for years.

1533
01:24:17,910 --> 01:24:21,370
Speaker 6:  But Microsoft is just divesting from all of that right now so that I don't

1534
01:24:21,370 --> 01:24:24,770
Speaker 6:  think that's it. And so I I think it probably looks like cloud

1535
01:24:25,090 --> 01:24:29,050
Speaker 6:  operating system or cloud gaming delivery, but they, they gotta get

1536
01:24:29,050 --> 01:24:32,970
Speaker 6:  that on phones and Apple does not wanna let them do that. So we'll see. Totally

1537
01:24:32,970 --> 01:24:36,930
Speaker 6:  fascinating line. Yeah. From Microsoft. I do think if there is a

1538
01:24:37,130 --> 01:24:39,090
Speaker 6:  platform to shift coming

1539
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:44,220
Speaker 6:  Microsoft, this isn't, I brought up Nadela in the Nochi layoffs in the beginning

1540
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:48,020
Speaker 6:  to be like, this is, that's the fire he was born in as Microsoft ceo,

1541
01:24:48,860 --> 01:24:52,670
Speaker 6:  right? Like Walmart bought Nokia, our boy

1542
01:24:52,670 --> 01:24:56,270
Speaker 6:  Steven eop just fully eop the entire nation of

1543
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:59,310
Speaker 6:  Finland, like destroy its national champion,

1544
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:05,110
Speaker 6:  Whatever. And then they nadela became the CEO and he had to just undo it

1545
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:09,030
Speaker 6:  all and be like, we're gonna lose mobile. And that's like, that's the fire

1546
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:12,790
Speaker 6:  that fortune. So I'm very curious to be like, to see what he thinks that

1547
01:25:12,990 --> 01:25:16,910
Speaker 6:  platform shift is and how Microsoft can win. Cuz I very much doubt that he

1548
01:25:16,910 --> 01:25:19,670
Speaker 6:  wants to lose again, you know, a platform shift.

1549
01:25:19,730 --> 01:25:22,750
Speaker 3:  Are you, are you gonna pitch that? He should come on de coder. Are we gonna

1550
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:25,630
Speaker 3:  take that opportunity now that if he's listening, he should come on. I

1551
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:29,150
Speaker 6:  Mean, we make that a, we make asks all the time. I will tell you that CEOs

1552
01:25:29,150 --> 01:25:33,030
Speaker 6:  do not want to go on hour long podcasts after they've laid off 10,000 people.

1553
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:36,910
Speaker 3:  That's fair.

1554
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:40,750
Speaker 6:  The problem with decoders, you have to want to come on. I can't just be like,

1555
01:25:40,850 --> 01:25:42,990
Speaker 6:  all right, sit down for your deposition.

1556
01:25:44,970 --> 01:25:48,790
Speaker 3:  You just unfurl your list of notes, all your questions.

1557
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:49,310
Speaker 3:  Yeah, it's great.

1558
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:53,430
Speaker 6:  It's like, all right, where were you on the night of October 11th

1559
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:57,430
Speaker 6:  when Stephen eop crept back into Microsoft's office

1560
01:25:57,490 --> 01:26:01,390
Speaker 6:  and destroyed Nokia? All right. I encourage you to go Google

1561
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:05,120
Speaker 6:  the words burning platform platform. Stephen eop, one of the greatest memos

1562
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,040
Speaker 6:  written of all time.

1563
01:26:07,710 --> 01:26:11,360
Speaker 6:  Very good. If you have not read the Zoe Schiffer, Casey New and

1564
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:15,240
Speaker 6:  Alex Heath feature about Twitter, honestly go buy it

1565
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:19,160
Speaker 6:  on an end. Buy a copy Newark May. That's cool. It's cool that we get to do

1566
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:21,880
Speaker 6:  that with them. It's cool that we have a company that allows us do that stuff.

1567
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:26,520
Speaker 6:  It's cool. They gave us their cover. That's awesome. It's cool to work with

1568
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:29,800
Speaker 6:  'em. So you can read on our site, go by and you stand. It's very good. We'll

1569
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:32,680
Speaker 6:  be back on Wednesday. Oh, Alex, what are you guys doing on Wednesday?

1570
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:36,480
Speaker 3:  Yeah, so on Wednesday we are gonna be talking with Dr. Margaret Omar,

1571
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:40,160
Speaker 3:  who is a professor and knows a lot more about non-competes than I do
