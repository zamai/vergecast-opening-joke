Speaker 2:  <inaudible>

18
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,280
Speaker 2:  hello and

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,610
Speaker 1:  Welcome to The Vergecast of flagship podcast has in app

20
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,850
Speaker 1:  purchases. This is a special parts of it. We did a whole episode

21
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,810
Speaker 1:  earlier about Google IO about the Mac review,

22
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,380
Speaker 1:  the iPad review part two, Addie Robertson's here,

23
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,370
Speaker 1:  and Hey, parts of you is all about the apple versus epic trial or epic

24
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,890
Speaker 1:  vs. Apple, I should say. And I would, I would say it backwards. It's epic

25
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,640
Speaker 1:  versus apple epics. The plaintiff, literally the testimony

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,030
Speaker 1:  portion of the trial wrapped up minutes ago from when you and I are

27
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,420
Speaker 1:  talking, there is sort of fake version of closing

28
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,290
Speaker 1:  arguments on Monday where both layers are just going to get asked questions

29
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,870
Speaker 1:  by the judge, from what I understand,

30
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,330
Speaker 3:  Which is probably going to be way more fun than normal closing arguments,

31
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:35,720
Speaker 3:  probably

32
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,560
Speaker 1:  Way more fun. Also the term everyone is using

33
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,020
Speaker 1:  for that closing argument is a hot

34
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,890
Speaker 1:  tubbing. And she's just very funny. Liz Lopatto will

35
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,550
Speaker 1:  be in the courtroom for the hot tubbing, but the actual

36
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:53,510
Speaker 1:  testimony, all the witnesses on the stand, all of the presentations

37
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:57,380
Speaker 1:  of evidence wrapped up today this week saw Phil Schiller,

38
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,220
Speaker 1:  Craig Federighi Tim Cook on the stand. There's a lot to

39
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,130
Speaker 1:  talk about their, but we should just start with what just happened because

40
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,880
Speaker 1:  the absolute end of the testimony

41
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,810
Speaker 1:  portion of the trial with Tim Cook on the stand was fireworks.

42
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,530
Speaker 1:  Like, and it just went sideways. It was a very boring for a week. Lots of

43
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,800
Speaker 1:  experts that we are not even talking about. Cause they were so boring and,

44
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,650
Speaker 1:  and the judge kind of just lit into Tim Cook. What happened to them?

45
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,550
Speaker 3:  Yeah. So yeah, judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, who is going to be

46
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,580
Speaker 3:  writing the opinion on the case and who occasionally interjects with some

47
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,540
Speaker 3:  usually pretty interesting, but very short questions. They more or

48
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,200
Speaker 3:  less finished examining Tim Cook. And then judge Rogers just steps in with

49
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,190
Speaker 3:  the question and she's like, okay, well it seems like most of the

50
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:44,150
Speaker 3:  revenue and the app store comes from games. So what's wrong with telling

51
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,110
Speaker 3:  people that they can go and make in-app purchases elsewhere. And

52
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:51,860
Speaker 3:  then that just kicks off this 10 minute long discussion where she and Tim

53
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,520
Speaker 3:  Cook have this like surprisingly testy exchange

54
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,440
Speaker 3:  over whether it makes sense that once apple put like once a

55
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,430
Speaker 3:  developer puts something in the store, apple brings enough value that

56
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,570
Speaker 3:  it should get a cut of like whatever happens in that app. Yeah.

57
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,170
Speaker 1:  And to me, this is kind of the central

58
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,470
Speaker 1:  question at the heart of this trial

59
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,280
Speaker 1:  is who is in control of your phone and

60
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,270
Speaker 1:  apples Ansar kind of nakedly throughout history. And we are in control

61
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:25,140
Speaker 1:  of your phone, right? So it doesn't matter if you download Fortnite or another

62
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,010
Speaker 1:  app or whatever, everything that happens inside that app,

63
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,970
Speaker 1:  Apple wants a part of it wants to in intermediate

64
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,840
Speaker 1:  your relationship to those developers in a huge variety of

65
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,350
Speaker 1:  ways for a huge variety of reasons. But the most important one

66
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:44,220
Speaker 1:  is if you buy something in an app, apple wants its cut. And

67
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,800
Speaker 1:  what struck me about this exchange is

68
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,430
Speaker 1:  that this is the whole trial. And we've heard all of these

69
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,730
Speaker 1:  reasons for apple to be in the middle of you and, and app

70
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,480
Speaker 1:  developer, privacy security, malware protection app

71
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,930
Speaker 1:  review content, review, naked bananas, the whole range of

72
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,890
Speaker 1:  reasons that apple should be in the middle. And when the judge,

73
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,820
Speaker 1:  when it cook, he was just like, no, we got to monetize our IP like

74
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,360
Speaker 1:  straight up. He was like, this is how we make the money. And if we don't

75
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,670
Speaker 1:  make the money this way, we'd have to figure out another way to make money.

76
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,020
Speaker 1:  And there was no pretense. All of the other stuff was out the window. Did

77
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:22,000
Speaker 1:  that, did you hear that? As clearly as I did cause it, I was

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,410
Speaker 1:  just, you know, if you've been listening to the trial, it's kind of a drone,

79
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,040
Speaker 1:  right? It's just like a blow quality zoom call in the background. I would

80
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,610
Speaker 1:  like to commend you for being able to live tweet through it as attentively

81
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,600
Speaker 1:  as you have in. Cause it has been a drone and this was like a jaw drop moment

82
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,560
Speaker 1:  for me that the judge came at cook and Tim Cook's answer was, this is how

83
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,090
Speaker 1:  we make the money. No pretense.

84
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,930
Speaker 3:  Yeah, no, it was because this and come right after a day where it was

85
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,380
Speaker 3:  basically, and like, I don't want to say inexplicably cause I get it. But

86
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,370
Speaker 3:  it was all about privacy in a completely tangential way.

87
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,490
Speaker 3:  It was like, okay, well what if someone doesn't want to do business with

88
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,450
Speaker 3:  apple because they deal with Chinese authorities and therefore

89
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,440
Speaker 3:  you will have the, and they just like, go on and on. And then there's

90
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,140
Speaker 3:  yeah. There's sudden exchange. And he's like, well, yeah, this is, we need

91
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,980
Speaker 3:  to leverage our IP. And then judge Rogers is like, well it seems like

92
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,920
Speaker 3:  gamers are subsidizing everybody else on the platform because they're spending

93
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,980
Speaker 3:  all this money and Tim Cook's like, yeah, well this is the business model

94
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,250
Speaker 1:  We pay. Yeah. And I, we wrote a story home. Gartenberg wrote a story for

95
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,670
Speaker 1:  us in 2019. If you remember a few years ago, apple made this big shift in

96
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:27,090
Speaker 1:  how it presented itself to investors that the future of its revenue growth

97
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,660
Speaker 1:  was services. And the services revenue are going to be a big

98
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,500
Speaker 1:  driver of Apple's growth because they had already sold as

99
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,590
Speaker 1:  many offenses they could sell. Right. And then there were no more co there

100
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:41,460
Speaker 1:  were no more countries to unlock. There are no more expensive models to sell.

101
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,120
Speaker 1:  Like the base of I-phones was out in the world. It's a huge number of hard

102
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,420
Speaker 1:  to move the needle. They were going to monetize the phone more aggressively.

103
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,360
Speaker 1:  And they're pretty open about this. Tim Cook said this on calls when high

104
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,810
Speaker 1:  and dug into it. And 2019, it was a pretty

105
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,700
Speaker 1:  obvious that the biggest chunk of services revenue, the app store and the

106
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,820
Speaker 1:  biggest chunk of that revenue was like candy crush,

107
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,810
Speaker 1:  whales, like people buying stuff and candy crush or, and

108
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,590
Speaker 1:  in Fortnite and, and other games was just the way that

109
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,460
Speaker 1:  apple was going to monetize. And that's a pretty even

110
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,180
Speaker 1:  just explaining it here, it's a pretty winding road, right? Like you gotta

111
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,780
Speaker 1:  get there. And it seemed like the judge clocked it instantly. And it was

112
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,900
Speaker 1:  like, but this is pretty unfair. And she was like, at some point she's like

113
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,410
Speaker 1:  the gamers are subsidizing Wells Fargo, which is

114
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,910
Speaker 1:  like almost to me. And like, it's this close to a meme.

115
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,400
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Yeah. Judge Rogers gamers rise

116
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,760
Speaker 3:  up.

117
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,340
Speaker 1:  H I just was not expecting her to go. There

118
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:43,240
Speaker 1:  was throughout this trial. So this is day 15 of the

119
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,110
Speaker 1:  trial. But in the courtroom, it has seemed like epic has done kind of a

120
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,830
Speaker 1:  meandering bad job that judge

121
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,610
Speaker 1:  Rogers is kind of like unimpressed. And then she just like came,

122
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,890
Speaker 1:  just came out, swinging right at the end.

123
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:00,790
Speaker 3:  Yeah. No, At the Epic has really, it seems like this whole week, their strategy

124
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:04,720
Speaker 3:  is just, let's see if we can make apple look like hypocrites. So like

125
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,380
Speaker 3:  they listed out, they just went to the app store and search for

126
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,130
Speaker 3:  BDSM and just print out pages and pages of like

127
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,670
Speaker 3:  search results and then made Phil Schiller, like read

128
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:19,660
Speaker 3:  them. And so it was just all these things that are meant to show, okay, well,

129
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,570
Speaker 3:  they're not actually holding up their standards. This privacy thing is a

130
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:26,500
Speaker 3:  pretext. It's not like you don't need the security. And then

131
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,530
Speaker 3:  judge her and hers just, yeah. Actually asked about the substance of the

132
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:33,370
Speaker 3:  competition law and like the substance of like, what are people actually

133
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,240
Speaker 3:  competing on when they are in the app store and what kind of services

134
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,930
Speaker 3:  apple actually

135
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,110
Speaker 1:  Selling. Yeah. And a one of the, again, and just in this

136
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,590
Speaker 1:  exchange, literally there was more action in this last 10 or 15

137
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,400
Speaker 1:  minutes. This maybe entire previous 15 days apple has

138
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,370
Speaker 1:  repeatedly brought up this small business program where they lowered

139
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,180
Speaker 1:  rates from 30% to 15% for developers to make less than a

140
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,900
Speaker 1:  million dollars a year in revenue is evidence of competition and

141
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,890
Speaker 1:  evidence and them lowering rates. And the judge says the issue with the

142
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:06,310
Speaker 1:  small business program, from what I've seen is it wasn't really the result

143
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,820
Speaker 1:  of competition. That's a result of the pressure you're feeling from investigations,

144
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,750
Speaker 1:  from lawsuits, not competition. And then there's the back and

145
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,960
Speaker 1:  forth and home cook says after we did our 15, there was

146
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,260
Speaker 1:  competition, Google dropped their 15%

147
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,010
Speaker 1:  and the judge has flat out, says, I understand

148
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:27,550
Speaker 1:  perhaps when Google changed its price, that was competition, but your

149
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,210
Speaker 1:  action, wasn't the result of competition. And that

150
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,960
Speaker 1:  is, I don't know, man. We could have like David and

151
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:39,040
Speaker 1:  Mark Hanson on the show. That's what he would say. Right? Like the angriest

152
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,520
Speaker 1:  developers in the ecosystem say exactly this and the judges

153
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,480
Speaker 1:  repeating what we have heard for years now. I think what I just don't

154
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,380
Speaker 1:  know is what, what that will lead to, right? Like

155
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,140
Speaker 1:  these were skeptical harsh questions, but who knows,

156
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,310
Speaker 3:  It's funny that the trial is kind of proceeding along completely

157
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,180
Speaker 3:  different. Like there are two completely different fights that Apple's fighting.

158
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,030
Speaker 3:  One is we shouldn't have to let people side load apps, which they can

159
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:07,140
Speaker 3:  like make, I think a, probably a pretty strong case for, and it's, it was

160
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,040
Speaker 3:  a huge giant uphill ask. So they've got this entire

161
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,400
Speaker 3:  thread about, well, this is the protection that we bring. This is

162
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,210
Speaker 3:  like why our system is secure. And there was all of

163
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:22,020
Speaker 3:  that. And that's flashy. And then there's this entire separate question of

164
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,890
Speaker 3:  like in app payments and even, and things that are like, even smaller than

165
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,550
Speaker 3:  that, like steering or anti steering rules, which the judge seems super interested

166
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,480
Speaker 3:  in that are really specifically about what happens when you've already

167
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,050
Speaker 3:  installed an app. And you're a regular user of that app. And how do you pay

168
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,910
Speaker 3:  within that? And like, how do you see your payment options inside that

169
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,870
Speaker 1:  Those rules are again, the sort of like site we

170
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:48,230
Speaker 1:  talked about this last week on the show, but that decides switching here

171
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,160
Speaker 1:  is like pretty fascinating that the law firm that epic has retained

172
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,910
Speaker 1:  crevasse just won a gigantic Supreme

173
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:59,810
Speaker 1:  court case about anti steering rules for American express, where they

174
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,770
Speaker 1:  protected the anti steering rules, where American express was allowed

175
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,610
Speaker 1:  to prohibit and merchants from nudging people and to

176
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,240
Speaker 1:  other credit cards. And in this case that same law firm is on epic side

177
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,230
Speaker 1:  saying you should let us nudge people and other payments, which is like

178
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,410
Speaker 1:  deeply fascinating inside baseball. But I think the judge

179
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,010
Speaker 1:  is looking at all of that. You know, one of the big

180
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:26,000
Speaker 1:  lines and the American express opinion from the Supreme court was this market

181
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,990
Speaker 1:  is hyper competitive. There are lots of credit cards. They're all fighting

182
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,500
Speaker 1:  for you all the time. So these provisions are not unfair. It's hyper

183
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,470
Speaker 1:  competitive here. And the judges like others, just no

184
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,370
Speaker 1:  competition. There's another section here where she's like, I'm

185
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,060
Speaker 1:  looking at evidence and the record that says survey developers, 39% of your

186
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,900
Speaker 1:  developers are and are dissatisfied. How are you feeling any motivation to

187
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,350
Speaker 1:  address their needs? And then she says, it doesn't seem like you feel any

188
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:55,100
Speaker 1:  pressure or competition to change the manner that you act in to address the

189
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,670
Speaker 1:  concerns of developers. And that's like, yeah, she just

190
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,150
Speaker 1:  clocked it. And I D I don't think Tim, I've

191
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,960
Speaker 1:  not yet heard. And apple executive, I rare you

192
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,950
Speaker 1:  rarely hear an apple executive on their back foot ever, but in this trial,

193
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:13,700
Speaker 1:  they've all been very confident, very direct in

194
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,360
Speaker 1:  control. And I think Tim Cook just seemed like on his back foot because he

195
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,500
Speaker 1:  wasn't expecting this.

196
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,740
Speaker 3:  Yeah, no. I mean, I don't think most people were not expecting and it was

197
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,370
Speaker 3:  really refreshing. Like, I'm really glad we got

198
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,540
Speaker 3:  this.

199
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,930
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And my theory with what epics again, and I don't think epic has done

200
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:33,410
Speaker 1:  a good job here. They certainly haven't laid out a case that like a normal

201
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:37,070
Speaker 1:  person would understand. I think it's remarkable that the judge has clocked

202
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,220
Speaker 1:  it and then on this. But my sense has always been, they know they're going

203
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,150
Speaker 1:  to appeal this. If epic wins, apple is going to appeal and then they're going

204
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,700
Speaker 1:  to appeal again. And then they're going to feel a third time to the Supreme

205
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,600
Speaker 1:  court if apple wins Epix. And I do that same thing. And

206
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,100
Speaker 1:  once you're on appeal, once you're out of the trial court, into the appellate

207
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,970
Speaker 1:  court, you cannot introduce new facts. So there's a part of me that

208
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,900
Speaker 1:  says, oh, epic is just trying to stuff as much information

209
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,740
Speaker 1:  into the record of this case so that they have it

210
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,550
Speaker 1:  should some appellate court judge three years from now be

211
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:13,300
Speaker 1:  like, did anyone ever do a study and have it offers are happy or not? And

212
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,110
Speaker 1:  they just like have it. And that I think has led to like a

213
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,380
Speaker 1:  very odd sort of mishmash of

214
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,660
Speaker 1:  ideas.

215
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,320
Speaker 3:  Judge Rogers also periodically makes note of the fact that,

216
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,950
Speaker 3:  like, there are a bunch of people watching this trial in public that there,

217
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,100
Speaker 3:  you know, she doesn't say this, but there are like YouTube rips of the

218
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,060
Speaker 3:  stream that I think that there is also a question of how much of this stuff

219
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,120
Speaker 3:  is just being played out, sort of for public opinion and for

220
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,050
Speaker 3:  regulators. And like George Rogers has been made

221
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,710
Speaker 3:  very clear. She is like, not particularly compelled. It seems by all of the

222
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:50,640
Speaker 3:  anecdotes that are brought up about whether developers are and, or are

223
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,600
Speaker 3:  not satisfied, but they are a thing that if

224
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,590
Speaker 3:  you're just trying to get the word out about whether your company is good,

225
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,700
Speaker 3:  there a thing that you put out

226
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,180
Speaker 1:  There. Yeah. And it's funny that one of the

227
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,170
Speaker 1:  recurring themes here is like an apple witness will get onstage and then

228
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:10,830
Speaker 1:  ethics lawyers will be like, why aren't any developers standing up for

229
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:14,070
Speaker 1:  you? And there's no way. And so that

230
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,030
Speaker 1:  question, and then Tuesday in real time, apple tried

231
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,900
Speaker 1:  to ensure snap had its developer event yesterday. They're

232
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,650
Speaker 1:  releasing a bunch of stuff in real time, Evan

233
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,920
Speaker 1:  Spiegel was on CNBC and said, I'm happy to pay the 30% fee to

234
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,910
Speaker 1:  apple. And like, literally they tried to show that story

235
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,840
Speaker 1:  to Tim Cook, like minutes after it was published. And they're like, you

236
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,770
Speaker 1:  cannot do that. Yes. And I

237
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:44,340
Speaker 1:  mean, just, just wild. So that was cook. And I would

238
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:48,330
Speaker 1:  say, if not for that last 15 minutes of cook, I might

239
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:52,200
Speaker 1:  take away of this would have been epic is going to lose at trial. They

240
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,160
Speaker 1:  know it, but we've got 10 years of appeals to come.

241
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,470
Speaker 1:  Right? Like, is that, is that kinda where you were?

242
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,340
Speaker 3:  I don't know. My take was more like, it seems like she judged Rogers

243
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:06,330
Speaker 3:  is genuinely interested in the anti steering stuff. My take would have

244
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:10,260
Speaker 3:  been probably developers have to be able

245
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,670
Speaker 3:  to put a link to their websites

246
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:15,540
Speaker 1:  And apps. Yeah. And tell people about the rules. This

247
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:19,200
Speaker 1:  is like a, the John Gruber take is, it is insane to

248
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,260
Speaker 1:  impose rules and people that they are not allowed to talk about it. So

249
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,830
Speaker 3:  Yeah, I was, I've kind of figured that that might come up no matter what

250
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,070
Speaker 3:  it has seemed pretty clear from the start that like, Apple's not going to

251
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:33,060
Speaker 3:  have to let third party stores on iOS and the arguments

252
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,690
Speaker 3:  about payment processing. It's a little harder for me to parse, but yeah,

253
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,960
Speaker 3:  this seemed more promising for them than I would have

254
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,430
Speaker 3:  guessed.

255
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,640
Speaker 1:  My, I don't know. You never know the judges,

256
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,630
Speaker 1:  like she's pushing the witness. She's got precedent to

257
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:52,010
Speaker 1:  write too. She's constrained in a lot of ways. Judges also, don't like being

258
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,670
Speaker 1:  overturned, who knows what she's going to do, who knows how she's going to

259
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:59,600
Speaker 1:  rule, but I could see her saying, you have to allow third-party

260
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,720
Speaker 1:  payment processors. Right. And we're not gonna do sideloading. We're not

261
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,530
Speaker 1:  gonna all, all this other stuff, but you should

262
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,860
Speaker 1:  give people a choice. And if your version is actually better than they will

263
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,640
Speaker 1:  pick it because that's competition. And that seems like a very

264
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,910
Speaker 1:  narrow ruling for her to make, without wandering into

265
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:20,630
Speaker 1:  sideloading and privacy issues and all of this other stuff. Like you can

266
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,410
Speaker 1:  just have another button, maybe I'm being too optimistic.

267
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,620
Speaker 3:  It is funny to me that she seems like she has complete disdain for this entire

268
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,370
Speaker 3:  business of like micro transactions that she just keeps bringing up yet.

269
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,830
Speaker 3:  It seems like you just want to make impulse buys.

270
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:36,670
Speaker 1:  Yeah. It's like kids. You want kids to spend money that they don't have that's

271
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,480
Speaker 1:  that's your business. I think that's response. It's

272
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,200
Speaker 1:  entirely fair. It's Apple's own TV show.

273
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,010
Speaker 1:  Mythic quest has like a, like a C plot

274
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:51,490
Speaker 1:  about whether they should make a mobile game and on Apple's own show, they're

275
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:54,850
Speaker 1:  like, you're just trying to fleece middle aged women out of money on the

276
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,360
Speaker 1:  potty. Like that's Apple's own shows take on mobile

277
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,870
Speaker 1:  games. We should actually write about that show. It is a very subversive

278
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:05,740
Speaker 1:  for apple to make a show that hates the computer game industry as

279
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,670
Speaker 1:  much as it does. So that's cook let's bracket

280
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,860
Speaker 1:  cook. So that's what happened at the end. That's like the most interesting

281
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,850
Speaker 1:  thing that's happened this week. We heard from Schiller. I

282
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,120
Speaker 1:  feel like we can just get through Schiller's testimony pretty quick. He was

283
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,110
Speaker 1:  great on the stand. Very confident he's Apple's marketing guy.

284
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,300
Speaker 1:  You weren't going to get him off message and made apple

285
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,330
Speaker 3:  Seem fun. He was like, I invented the click wheel. Yeah.

286
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,510
Speaker 1:  Like there's not a lot to say. They tried, they tried to come at him a little

287
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,210
Speaker 1:  bit with a message. They tried to come and cook a little bit with our message.

288
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,690
Speaker 1:  I thought we were going to hear a lot about iMessage lock-in in this trial.

289
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,570
Speaker 1:  And we just did not. Yeah. It's really weird. Yeah. I mean, it was just a

290
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:44,050
Speaker 1:  part like there's a lot of evidence and the world that like, I don't know,

291
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:47,410
Speaker 1:  teenagers want to have iPhones because if they have a green bubble, they

292
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:51,160
Speaker 1:  get bullied. It seems like a thing you can

293
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,980
Speaker 1:  say, like you put in the record to say, it's hard to switch her and I-phone

294
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,360
Speaker 1:  and epic just didn't do it.

295
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,460
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And, and to be clear, I don't mean that, like, I think that's a slam

296
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:00,610
Speaker 3:  dunk, but I think it was way stronger and more interesting than a lot of

297
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,950
Speaker 3:  the stuff epic did end up actually bringing.

298
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:06,280
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Unsure. The judge has friends who are green bubbles and she's

299
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,030
Speaker 1:  like, what up get? And I feel like it's a very

300
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,900
Speaker 1:  relatable thing, but epic didn't pursue it very much, but

301
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,620
Speaker 1:  Schiller was good. Like I think he, he just handled

302
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,370
Speaker 1:  Epic's questioning very well. He's very S again, he's Apple's and marketing

303
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,680
Speaker 1:  guy has been for a long time. Very smooth, very

304

348
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:01,550
Speaker 4:  real S

349
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:05,480
Speaker 1:  Craig Federighi. That testimony

350
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,470
Speaker 1:  was also to me, just like very revealing of how apple

351
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,590
Speaker 1:  thinks of it's customers and what happens on the phone.

352
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:16,220
Speaker 3:  Yeah, so he was basically there to counter

353
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,030
Speaker 3:  epics, last expert, witness James Mickens,

354
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,990
Speaker 3:  the like computer science guy who was talking about why it's

355
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,440
Speaker 3:  really reasonable like that. You should be able to open up the store

356
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,250
Speaker 3:  that all of the really important security occurs on device, that you

357
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:35,120
Speaker 3:  have systems like code signing that you can deploy on the

358
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,110
Speaker 3:  Mac that you can also deploy on iOS. And then Craig Federighi gets up and

359
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,920
Speaker 3:  he's like, no, that's completely dumb. That is

360
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,690
Speaker 3:  not how any of this works.

361
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:48,190
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I mean, that all makes sense. And these

362
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,120
Speaker 1:  are Grealy hard problems, like is good

363
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,750
Speaker 1:  that apple has in control of things on the phone at the scale they're in

364
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,620
Speaker 1:  control. And then, because if there is some road malware that

365
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,700
Speaker 1:  hits every iPhone, apple does have a kill switch and, and turn it off.

366
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,360
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And I think that epic has not made a super compelling case that

367
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,320
Speaker 3:  the iPhone is not actually more secure than a lot of

368
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,780
Speaker 3:  these other platforms. Like that's just kind of the trade-off that you make

369
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,860
Speaker 3:  with an iPhone.

370
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,460
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I mean, there's been a lot of conflicting evidence

371
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,270
Speaker 1:  presented about the relative security of Android versus

372
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:24,840
Speaker 1:  iPhone. There has been dueling study

373
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,170
Speaker 1:  is it's funny, we're talking just after we did our IO

374
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,830
Speaker 1:  episode, you know, Google stood up at IO and said, Android is more secure

375
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:35,550
Speaker 1:  than anything. Samsung will tell you that knocks on. And, and

376
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:39,000
Speaker 1:  Samsung Android phone is the most secure thing on any phone possible

377
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,330
Speaker 1:  ever dueling size. And to me, he just came back and

378
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,410
Speaker 1:  watched.

379
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,980
Speaker 3:  Yeah, no, it seems like it. And they're also like, they're just kind of disagreeing

380
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,490
Speaker 3:  about what counts as security like that was Apple's big thing was that, well,

381
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:54,150
Speaker 3:  if you just look at code or zero days or something like that than malware,

382
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:58,050
Speaker 3:  then maybe it's kind of a wash. But if you look at it's really

383
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,800
Speaker 3:  easy to get something like, that's trying to scam you through a

384
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,980
Speaker 3:  third-party store that like, we're going to focus on social

385
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,820
Speaker 3:  engineering. So yeah, a lot of it was

386
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,900
Speaker 3:  complicated.

387
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,590
Speaker 1:  And then I don't think there's an answer there. Like it is a complicated

388
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:17,160
Speaker 1:  subject. Do you think the iPhone faces more state

389
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,060
Speaker 1:  sponsored zero day attacks than Android?

390
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,930
Speaker 1:  There's no way to know, but we also know that the answer is, yes,

391
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:28,860
Speaker 1:  it faces a lot of state sponsored zero day attacks. Are

392
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,760
Speaker 1:  there more scam apps in one store versus another hard to tell, but there

393
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,540
Speaker 1:  are a lot of scam apps and all of these review processes are supposed to

394
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:40,080
Speaker 1:  catch it and protect it. So a wash, but that I think

395
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,920
Speaker 1:  brings any fresh Tesla's and her nose, like the other

396
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,730
Speaker 1:  comparison to make is two windows on the Mac. And so epic tried to

397
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:51,390
Speaker 1:  come at Federighi about the Mac. And that was, to me,

398
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:55,290
Speaker 1:  just, just wild that the comparisons he

399
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,630
Speaker 1:  was making of the analogies he was using.

400
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:01,200
Speaker 3:  So the Mac is like a car it's

401
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,040
Speaker 3:  I'm you can drive it off road is what he'd said.

402
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,970
Speaker 3:  And you have to be really carefully trained to use it. He did

403
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,760
Speaker 3:  not say that you need a license, but apparently it's really like, you need

404
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,670
Speaker 3:  to be a specialist. You have to understand. And you knew that you were getting

405
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:17,820
Speaker 3:  into this thing, you were buying this metal death scene, the

406
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,480
Speaker 3:  Mac and, and the iPhone and the iPad. They're

407
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,350
Speaker 3:  great because babies can use them literally. Yeah.

408
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:28,440
Speaker 1:  I mean, literally he says with ILS, we were saved. We able to create something

409
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,530
Speaker 1:  where children even infants can operate an iOS devices and be safe in doing

410
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:34,650
Speaker 1:  so this is also complicated,

411
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:38,310
Speaker 1:  right? One of the great things about iOS devices and

412
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:41,910
Speaker 1:  Android devices sort of out of the box is that it's a very

413
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:45,790
Speaker 1:  hard to get malware and bad apps on them. And federally

414
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:49,250
Speaker 1:  even said, we have trained iOS users to just

415
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,550
Speaker 1:  download apps with abandon because you can't do too much

416
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:56,300
Speaker 1:  damage. Okay. On the flip side, it's

417
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:00,230
Speaker 1:  like, what if you do think that you are

418
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,160
Speaker 1:  capable of operating your max safely should not be able

419
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,120
Speaker 1:  to operate my iPhone that way. Like, there's just like a big question

420
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,660
Speaker 1:  in there. And it's like, what if I don't want to be a baby?

421
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:14,290
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And it's on one hand. It is okay. Look,

422
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:17,650
Speaker 3:  I, I have my phone and I have my computer. I have both these

423
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:21,250
Speaker 3:  devices and they serve different purposes. And if I have a

424
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,910
Speaker 3:  computer I'm perfectly happy to like install software on the

425
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:28,180
Speaker 3:  computer and use my phone as a lockdown, like little lock

426
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,690
Speaker 3:  box. The thing that's frustrating to me is that

427
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:35,560
Speaker 3:  also like apple and a lot of other companies see mobile as the

428
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,770
Speaker 3:  future of computing. Like they just see that as the future of what the computer

429
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:42,370
Speaker 3:  is. And that's not really the future of like, if you think of the

430
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:46,360
Speaker 3:  iPhone as a supplementary device, then I understand where they're coming

431
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,790
Speaker 3:  from. If you think of it as the future of computing, I don't know that I

432
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,590
Speaker 3:  want that to be the future of computing.

433
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:54,130
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And again, this is part two around chest Dieter. And I just

434
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:57,580
Speaker 1:  spent, I don't know, six hours talking about his iPad pro review. And this

435
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,420
Speaker 1:  is what we talked about that apple sees the iPad pro, which

436
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:05,350
Speaker 1:  runs iPad of us, which is basically ILS is the

437
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:09,340
Speaker 1:  future, their future product. And even other like updating the max and

438
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,970
Speaker 1:  they bought new chips. Every time they talk about the iPad, do you see them

439
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,720
Speaker 1:  just burst with pride that they've invented the computer in the future? And

440
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,710
Speaker 1:  it is as locked down as an iOS device.

441
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:24,460
Speaker 1:  And I just, I was just reading this quote from Federighi Mac users,

442
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,610
Speaker 1:  expected degree of flexibility, and it's useful to what they do because some

443
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,280
Speaker 1:  of them are software developers. Some of them are pros running their unique

444
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,180
Speaker 1:  tools and having that power as a part of it, this

445
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,600
Speaker 1:  implies that software developers and pros running their own

446
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,410
Speaker 1:  tools should not use iOS devices. And that

447
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:45,160
Speaker 1:  is, has no correlation to how they talk about those

448
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,850
Speaker 1:  products. And there's just a disconnect. I

449
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:52,360
Speaker 1:  keep coming back to it. Apple really thinks

450
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,930
Speaker 1:  that it is always in control of your phone, this

451
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:59,500
Speaker 1:  computer that you have in your pocket all the time, kind of always

452
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,490
Speaker 1:  belongs to apple. And some people can pay. Like I hear this when

453
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:06,910
Speaker 1:  I listen to, and I get the emails, some people are paying apple for

454
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:10,600
Speaker 1:  that, but some people are paying apple for a bunch of other stuff and getting

455
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,530
Speaker 1:  that as part of the deal and with no way to turn it off. And I, I just think

456
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:15,880
Speaker 1:  that's really strange.

457
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,360
Speaker 3:  And also just, I don't know, it's weird if you try to extend, if you try

458
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,290
Speaker 3:  to think if every computing device in my life worked like the

459
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:27,130
Speaker 3:  iPhone, that would feel completely bizarre. Like if I

460
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:30,910
Speaker 3:  installed a piece of software on my Mac

461
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:34,750
Speaker 3:  and then anything I bought within that software or anything I did with that

462
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:38,650
Speaker 3:  software, having to go through some kind of centralized apple system, that

463
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:42,310
Speaker 3:  seems really weird to me. Like it doesn't necessarily, I kind of

464
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:46,020
Speaker 3:  get like costs on a phone that seems

465
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:49,590
Speaker 3:  intuitive just because it's a thing that's happened so much, but if you extend

466
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:53,430
Speaker 3:  it to other devices, that seems really strange and intrusive.

467
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:56,870
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And I, this obviously comes straight to the Mac app

468
00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:00,800
Speaker 1:  store and how apple has that facility on the Mac. I

469
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,410
Speaker 1:  will tell you, we've heard from a lot of golfers over the year. And so they

470
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:07,100
Speaker 1:  do not love the Mac app store. There's just a lot of reasons to not use it

471
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,700
Speaker 1:  to not be in it. Chief among them are all the complaints we hear about iOS.

472
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,950
Speaker 1:  They don't get to own their customer. They don't get to do updates. They

473
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:16,850
Speaker 1:  do free trials, all of a social life, but federate, he was like the

474
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:19,550
Speaker 1:  level of malware on the Mac. We don't find it

475
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:23,240
Speaker 1:  acceptable. And if we use the Mac security model on the

476
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,420
Speaker 1:  iPhone with all those devices, all of that value, it would get run over to

477
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:30,290
Speaker 1:  a degree dramatically worse than is already happening on the Mac. iOS

478
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:34,250
Speaker 1:  has a dramatically higher bar for consumer protection. The Mac is not meeting

479
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:38,120
Speaker 1:  that bar today. That is such a just dire evaluation of

480
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,310
Speaker 1:  what the Mac is. I've been trying

481
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:44,270
Speaker 3:  To not take all of this too seriously, just because this is the thing you

482
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:47,390
Speaker 3:  say in a trial. Like you have to be in a trial, you have to say trial things

483
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:51,110
Speaker 3:  that make sense for your argument, like how we've had 50 different definitions

484
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:54,170
Speaker 3:  of a game. And I'm probably pretty sure that if you asked him Sweeney, like

485
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:57,860
Speaker 3:  in a bar, can you play like, describe your platonic ideal of a

486
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:01,010
Speaker 3:  game. He'd probably say something different than what he says and trial that's

487
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:03,380
Speaker 3:  fair, but it's still, it's really grim.

488
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,920
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I, I have struggled to sort of

489
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,980
Speaker 1:  balance it out as you're talking about, right. It's the trial and they're

490
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,670
Speaker 1:  saying it, they're also under oath. There's a level of, are we

491
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:15,950
Speaker 1:  evaluating this for the trial and, and just making the arguments are going

492
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:18,800
Speaker 1:  to move on and then they're just mercenaries and it says, the next thing

493
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,730
Speaker 1:  they need to say, or is this how they really feel? And I, to

494
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:26,720
Speaker 1:  me, Tim Cook, when being pushed on why he has to lock

495
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,350
Speaker 1:  down in at purchases saying, this is how we

496
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:34,250
Speaker 1:  monetize our software development and for the phone, that is as real as it

497
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:38,240
Speaker 1:  gets, right? There's none of this bluster about malware security. It

498
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,300
Speaker 1:  was just, this is our business model and we're sticking to it. We think it's

499
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,450
Speaker 1:  fair. And then all this stuff of federal and private and, and

500
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,080
Speaker 1:  securities, that's all of the distractions around it. And I I'm wondering

501
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,770
Speaker 1:  how much of the judge has bought the distraction versus like being

502
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:55,070
Speaker 1:  centered honed in on the business model

503
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:58,340
Speaker 1:  question.

504
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,560
Speaker ?:  When it comes to tech, you want the latest and greatest, but there's definitely

505
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,210
Speaker ?:  something to be said for time-tested design that works with everything. And

506
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:06,890
Speaker ?:  that will last for years, Baird, Winthrop, CEO, and founder of American

507
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:10,190
Speaker ?:  giant grew up with a sweatshirt from the fifties that his father gave him

508
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,860
Speaker ?:  today. It's still in his closet and it looks better than ever. So he set

509
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:16,520
Speaker ?:  out to recreate a timeless classic. That's the thinking behind the American

510
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,390
Speaker ?:  giant classic full zip hoodie. They obsessed over every detail, both functional

511
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,420
Speaker ?:  and aesthetic. So you'll be obsessed with it too. They even brought in a

512
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:27,230
Speaker ?:  formal apple, industrial designer to help perfect. The design American shine

513
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:30,500
Speaker ?:  hoodies are built with a custom design heavyweight cotton fleece, locally

514
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,680
Speaker ?:  grown in sewn in North Carolina. And they're made to last with a durable,

515
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,670
Speaker ?:  double lined hood and reinforced elbow patches. Plus they added side panels

516
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:41,590
Speaker ?:  for increased mobility and a slim body skimming fit, but most it's

517
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,740
Speaker ?:  comfortable. American giant is committed to reviving local manufacturing

518
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,310
Speaker ?:  and they believe that all it takes is one quality piece to set any standard.

519
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:51,220
Speaker ?:  If your capsule wardrobe has room for only one hoodie, make it one you'll

540
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:03,190
Speaker 1:  Okay. We've had a couple of minutes left. I want to end. We can't end without

541
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:07,120
Speaker 1:  talking about further ridiculous definitions of

542
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,840
Speaker 1:  what a game is central to this trial. Walk me through what

543
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,590
Speaker 1:  happened with roadblocks because they, they like

544
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:18,460
Speaker 1:  changed our whole website and they changed it back and like show. And I got

545
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,360
Speaker 1:  to do a big smile, like what happened?

546
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,140
Speaker 3:  Okay. So roadblocks is, I'm going to try to describe this in the broadest

547
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,890
Speaker 3:  terms possible. It is a piece of software and

548
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:32,880
Speaker 3:  people can use like a language in which you

549
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,630
Speaker 3:  write rules to make things that people can interact

550
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:40,290
Speaker 3:  with. And they upload that to the central software and people can

551
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:44,250
Speaker 3:  launch those pieces of user created software

552
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:47,910
Speaker 3:  from inside roadblocks, the software, and

553
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:51,870
Speaker 3:  then the people who create those years of generated experiences can

554
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:55,680
Speaker 3:  sell things around that. And so you have game studios that can

555
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,380
Speaker 3:  basically pay their employees by selling in app purchases. Through these

556
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:02,370
Speaker 3:  things, typically call them games and roadblocks of classes. He came in this

557
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:06,210
Speaker 3:  store and the early in the trial, there was a lot of confusion

558
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:10,050
Speaker 3:  about this because apparently around 2014, somebody

559
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:13,980
Speaker 3:  actually like pointed out that look, robots, look, it looks a lot like a

560
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,580
Speaker 3:  store within a store that you just, it's not even like second life you go

561
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,430
Speaker 3:  in and you wander around. It's like, you get a list of things and you launch

562
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:24,090
Speaker 3:  the thing and the thing launches and it's a game. And so they passed it to

563
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:27,600
Speaker 3:  the review board. Apparently just nothing happened. I just kept going and

564
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,530
Speaker 3:  it's very successful now. And so they're one of their apps

565
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:35,370
Speaker 3:  to review executives was like, yeah, well, the thing is the things inside

566
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,430
Speaker 3:  roadblocks, those aren't games. He also said, roadblocks itself, wasn't a

567
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:42,110
Speaker 3:  game which has its own weird thing. And he's like, yeah, games have a beginning

568
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:45,980
Speaker 3:  and end and there's challenges in place. And then this was

569
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,530
Speaker 3:  reiterated a couple of times it's was like, yeah, this was like a Minecraft

570
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:52,220
Speaker 3:  map. And it doesn't introduce new code. And then

571
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,700
Speaker 3:  roadblocks, which like this, isn't weird for it

572
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,520
Speaker 3:  necessarily. It's been positioning itself as a metaverse. It's called these

573
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,040
Speaker 3:  things experiences a long time, but it just went and

574
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:05,030
Speaker 3:  like control, like find and replace game

575
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:08,750
Speaker 3:  with experience all over its website and like its apps, the

576
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,780
Speaker 3:  games tab became the discover tab. The

577
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:15,770
Speaker 3:  experiences you creating a new game became creating a new experience

578
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:19,670
Speaker 3:  and sort of max players, you of max people, they'd just like wiped everything

579
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:23,300
Speaker 3:  game related from their sites. And then Phil Schiller came to the

580
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:27,020
Speaker 3:  stand days after this had happened. And they're like, so

581
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,080
Speaker 3:  roadblocks, what do you think roadblocks is? And you're like, well, in my

582
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,920
Speaker 3:  opinion, it's a game. And you're like mugged. Yeah. I mean, I'm not in court,

583
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,980
Speaker 3:  so I can't see this, but yes,

584
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,950
Speaker 1:  You like, I was in the room and she was like a huge grin on Schiller's

585
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:42,400
Speaker 1:  face when this happened. Yeah. Amazing.

586
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,300
Speaker 3:  And then the distinction he said is that there's

587
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:50,290
Speaker 3:  probably games inside of it, but the games are not developed by developers.

588
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:53,920
Speaker 3:  They created by creators because

589
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,670
Speaker 3:  developers, they're making a thing. They're like coding and

590
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:01,300
Speaker 3:  independent app that like goes on your phone. It could

591
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,450
Speaker 3:  introduce malicious code. Apple has to review it. But these things they're

592
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:08,200
Speaker 3:  created, they are using a sort of sandbox that

593
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,950
Speaker 3:  roadblocks creates like a scripted sandbox. And we know all the code that

594
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,770
Speaker 3:  can run and roadblocks. And therefore, if you're building this thing inside

595
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:18,730
Speaker 3:  roadblocks, we know that it's safe. Sure. Which then raises a bunch more

596
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:22,600
Speaker 3:  questions like, okay, then what's the problem with the Microsoft, like

597
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,500
Speaker 3:  with X cloud, which is basically video. And then they have answers to those

598
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,980
Speaker 3:  questions, but it gets complicated. But the point is, I kind of feel for

599
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,950
Speaker 3:  roadblocks, they have gotten gone through a real roller

600
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:34,000
Speaker 3:  coaster.

601
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Speaker 1:  I mean, I think one of your tweets was like, apple is all over the map on

602
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,450
Speaker 1:  the roadblocks question. Like every apple witness had a different

603
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:42,520
Speaker 1:  answer and then robots itself

604
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,680
Speaker 3:  Usually conflicting. Yeah.

605
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,830
Speaker 1:  And she started all in place. And then roadblocks itself is older than the

606
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:50,320
Speaker 1:  app store, like in the

607
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,250
Speaker 1:  iPhone. It's very good. I think

608
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:58,210
Speaker 1:  my favorite part of all, this is that your story was red. It was a red to

609
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:58,870
Speaker 1:  Schiller.

610
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:02,290
Speaker 3:  Yeah. It was brought up and then he read one paragraph of

611
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,040
Speaker 3:  it.

612
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,550
Speaker 1:  I mean, our, just the fact that we're so intertwined in this, but like, and

613
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:10,480
Speaker 1:  he's being too humble about it. Like they T they brought

614
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,840
Speaker 1:  up her story in court and had S Phil Schiller

615
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,500
Speaker 1:  read a paragraph. Addie's verge story about roadblocks

616
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,430
Speaker 1:  changing the word game to experience, which is just for

617
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:25,390
Speaker 1:  talk about a metaphor. It's like, we're just in it. Like, we're just constantly

618
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:28,930
Speaker 1:  just really strange. Okay. So on

619
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:32,740
Speaker 1:  Monday, the judge is going to have the lawyers from both sides.

620
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,640
Speaker 1:  She's going to hot tub them and ask both sides questions at once. That is

621
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,690
Speaker 1:  the quote unquote closing argument. When are we expecting a

622
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,160
Speaker 1:  decision before

623
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,550
Speaker 3:  August 13th? Probably.

624
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:47,000
Speaker 1:  So August 12th at best.

625
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,930
Speaker 3:  So we're going to have the, they're going to file final briefs next Friday

626
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:53,900
Speaker 3:  by next Friday. So it's definitely not before then. And then after that,

627
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,500
Speaker 3:  there was a jury selection for another trial and like early

628
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,130
Speaker 3:  June, and then this opinion could be

629
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:05,060
Speaker 3:  hundreds of pages long. There's a bunch of evidence to consider. And,

630
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:08,750
Speaker 3:  but we're hopefully going to get it before mid

631
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,890
Speaker 3:  August.

632
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:13,070
Speaker 1:  Okay. Well, it has been a long and strange three

633
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:16,970
Speaker 1:  weeks. I cannot believe that you've lived tweeted all day every day,

634
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:20,960
Speaker 1:  one more day, just one more day to go. But it has been, I don't

635
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,770
Speaker 1:  know, it's just a very revealing trial. Like I hear what you're saying. That

636
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:28,730
Speaker 1:  sometimes you say what you need to say at trial, but Apple's attitude

637
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:32,480
Speaker 1:  about what the phone is and their

638
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,440
Speaker 1:  constant relationship to you. For example, I think

639
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,830
Speaker 1:  cook use the best buy analogy again today. Why would

640
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:43,760
Speaker 1:  Apple ask best buy to publish a lower price

641
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,330
Speaker 1:  for the phone and best buy? Yeah, I get it the best way would probably say

642
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:51,260
Speaker 1:  no, but in Fortnite makes

643
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,500
Speaker 1:  no sense that like, once you take the iPhone home, it is covered with ads

644
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,370
Speaker 1:  for apple services. Apple itself will be like, it's time to buy a new phone.

645
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:01,940
Speaker 1:  You can buy it directly from us on your phone. They

646
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:05,900
Speaker 1:  are totally in control of that purchase experience. And they want to extend

647
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,110
Speaker 1:  it into every other app and extend that control. And every other

648
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:13,040
Speaker 1:  app, if this case taught me anything, if this trial taught me

649
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,670
Speaker 1:  anything, it's that all the way up to Tim Cook, that is their

650
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:20,540
Speaker 1:  belief that third-party apps are just extensions of

651
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,660
Speaker 1:  ILS, not other applications that run on top of the

652
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:27,620
Speaker 1:  phone. And I just it's as verge Casty as it

653
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:31,550
Speaker 1:  gets. Right. And that is a very narrow, semantic debate,

654
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:35,060
Speaker 1:  but it is, I thought it was super revealing. What's your big takeaway?

655
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:39,050
Speaker 3:  I mean, and in my takeaway, my takeaway is that it's weird to think

656
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:43,040
Speaker 3:  about the web in all of this, that it's

657
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,460
Speaker 3:  weird that everyone just points to the web constantly is this space where

658
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:50,120
Speaker 3:  you can do anything. And this is like the final frontier of things that are

659
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:54,080
Speaker 3:  not controlled by whatever company makes the system that

660
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,450
Speaker 3:  you're running. And we're like, oh, well, if you don't want to pay something,

661
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:00,320
Speaker 3:  just go and do it through the web. That's the most that I think I've seen

662
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,260
Speaker 3:  anyone talk about the web being useful for a long time, which

663
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:06,920
Speaker 1:  Is really weird, amazing. And the judge was like, all right, I've read all

664
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,640
Speaker 1:  the evidence. I've heard all the testimony.

665
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,150
Speaker 1:  Apple has to allow secondary web browsing engines on the iPhone done and

666
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:17,960
Speaker 1:  dusted. Mike walked away. I don't think that's going to happen, but it would

667
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,590
Speaker 1:  be an incredible outcome. Okay. And thank you so much. Thank you for

668
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:25,580
Speaker 1:  listening to hours of Vergecast this week, which is insane, but

669
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:28,190
Speaker 1:  thank you all for listening and getting us through it. We'll be back next

670
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:31,400
Speaker 1:  week. With more, you can tweet at us. Addie is at the Dexter jerky. You should

671
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,020
Speaker 1:  look at her. Twitter is full of treatment trial. Well, I'm at reckless. We

672
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,330
Speaker 1:  love hearing from you next week, rock and

673
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:56,220
