21
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,070
Speaker 1:  Hello, and welcome to the Vergecast flagship podcast,

22
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,990
Speaker 1:  bad charts. And so I wanted to start in a high, and then I was like,

23
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,680
Speaker 1:  what's in my heart. And it's chart crime, which is my new

24
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,370
Speaker 1:  favorite phrase.

25
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,200
Speaker 3:  There's a lot of

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,150
Speaker 1:  Them. I'm afraid of the light out screens. This here

27
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,240
Speaker 3:  I am so excited for this very specific podcast.

28
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,290
Speaker 1:  It's this one that's going to get off the rails. Pumped dancy for this here.

29
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:34,710
Speaker 1:  How are you

30
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,040
Speaker 4:  Doing?

31
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,330
Speaker 1:  Alison is here housing. Hello. A little bit later. Monica is going to join

32
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,860
Speaker 1:  us cause it's apple review week.

33
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,770
Speaker 4:  It is it's been apple review week. It's

34
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,480
Speaker 1:  Been an apple review

35
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,890
Speaker 3:  For a week.

36
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,910
Speaker 1:  Alison reviewed the iPhone se Monica review the Mac

37
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,690
Speaker 1:  studio, which I reviewed the studio display. It's

38
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,690
Speaker 1:  we read both things at the same time, but I was focused on displaying. She

39
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,650
Speaker 1:  was focused on and then Dan reviewed the iPad, the iPad air. So lots of apple

40
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,580
Speaker 1:  stuff. There's some other stuff we should talk about. But like Alex

41
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,480
Speaker 1:  said, this, this podcast is going to get wild. Cause

42
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,630
Speaker 1:  there's good parts and there's bad parts and there's medium parts. We're

43
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,220
Speaker 1:  going to laugh. We're going to cry. It's

44
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,120
Speaker 4:  The full spectrum.

45
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,180
Speaker 1:  There's going to be some very oblique references to Dieter jokes. It's gonna

46
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,840
Speaker 1:  be great. Let's start with the iPhone. Alison, your V the

47
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,710
Speaker 1:  iPhone se it feels like there's a lot to say. And it also

48
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,800
Speaker 1:  nothing to say. It's a very nice phone.

49
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,000
Speaker 5:  That's the thing it's like, it's still what the iPhone se has

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,660
Speaker 5:  been. It is a very inexpensive way to get into

51
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,660
Speaker 5:  Apple's ecosystem. You get, so it starts at

52
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,640
Speaker 5:  4 29. You get, you know, the newest processor and

53
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,370
Speaker 5:  the eight 15, but it's kind of just a lot of the same of

54
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,120
Speaker 5:  what the iPhone se has offered in the past. There's I mean, there's five

55
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,050
Speaker 5:  G now, which you know, where am I excited?

56
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,120
Speaker 5:  But yeah, it's still, it's still a really solid, like,

57
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,500
Speaker 5:  amazing mid-range phone. But I think at this point, this is

58
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,250
Speaker 5:  just kind of like my whole takeaway and the review is

59
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,750
Speaker 5:  a 4.7 inch screen is just not cutting it. And

60
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,020
Speaker 5:  I say this as a person who loves small phones

61
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,720
Speaker 5:  dearly, they're wonderful.

62
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,650
Speaker 3:  I'm with you.

63
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:24,730
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And it's, it's like such a joy to put this phone

64
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,210
Speaker 5:  in my coat pocket and have that moment where I'm like, oh, is the phone in

65
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,360
Speaker 5:  my pocket? I'm like, yes, it is. It was just really small.

66
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,590
Speaker 5:  But it just, it feels really cramped. And it's those

67
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,430
Speaker 5:  bezels really it's like the aspect ratio of the

68
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,300
Speaker 5:  screen. And there's a lot of real estate taken up by the chunky bezzles.

69
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,320
Speaker 5:  It's an iPhone eight design, which was put out to

70
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,160
Speaker 5:  pasture quite awhile ago, except for the iPhone se

71
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,660
Speaker 3:  They had kept the size of the phone, like the out the external size of the

72
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,500
Speaker 3:  phone, but gotten rid of the bezels and just made it all screen. Would

73
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,790
Speaker 3:  you have liked it more?

74
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:05,020
Speaker 5:  I definitely would've liked him more, but then it's like, what does the iPhone

75
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,770
Speaker 5:  mini and then that's a philosophical

76
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,880
Speaker 5:  question you have to ask

77
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,910
Speaker 1:  You say it's an iPhone eight design. I just want to come. Isn't it more like

78
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,810
Speaker 1:  an iPhone six design, right? This basic

79
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,390
Speaker 1:  designer floating around for a very long time.

80
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,790
Speaker 5:  I have my original S

81
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,530
Speaker 1:  E that's like the iPhone five.

82
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,850
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. It's it goes back. It is a throwback. Yeah. I don't

83
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,510
Speaker 5:  know. It's not the worst. You have the home button still, which some

84
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,990
Speaker 5:  people really want and they don't want face ID. And

85
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,980
Speaker 5:  that iPhone se will give you that you can get the latest

86
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,790
Speaker 5:  performance. You get a great phone, you get to keep your touch

87
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,690
Speaker 5:  ID. So it like, if that's you, then this

88
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,190
Speaker 5:  is your phone. And it's awesome.

89
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,510
Speaker 1:  Sorry. I was talking to our friend Joanna Sarnath wall street journal. And

90
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:56,110
Speaker 1:  she went through the same review week that we did. And she was like, he don't

91
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,710
Speaker 1:  understand for wall street journal readers. The iPhone

92
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,580
Speaker 1:  se is the Superbowl. Like, this is what they want.

93
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,540
Speaker 1:  This is what they care about the most. She was like, I can't screw up the

94
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,500
Speaker 1:  sec review. This is it. Like they don't, they, they love

95
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,250
Speaker 1:  the home button. They want a great camera. They don't

96
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,670
Speaker 1:  want to mess with what they know. This is like the phone for them.

97
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:23,410
Speaker 1:  I think it's fascinating. Right? Like our audience is very much like what

98
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,410
Speaker 1:  is the latest and great. I mean, if you're listening to this show, you were

99
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,160
Speaker 1:  very interested in things like phone specifications, at least I

100
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,950
Speaker 1:  believe you are. And I just think that's like, you know, Apple's product

101
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,730
Speaker 1:  line is so big. That's like basically every $50 price point or I guess now

102
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:40,510
Speaker 1:  in the 5g era at every $70 price point, apple

103
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,930
Speaker 1:  has a phone for you. And this one just like holding down the low end.

104
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,920
Speaker 1:  But then I just looking at their pricing, you can get an iPhone

105
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,820
Speaker 1:  11, which is kind of like a dramatically better phone

106
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,050
Speaker 1:  with a bigger screen, for what, 70 bucks

107
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,990
Speaker 1:  more it's 4 99. And it's like, I would just get that.

108
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,190
Speaker 1:  Like, you can get 128 gig version of iPhone 11 for five forty nine, but

109
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,630
Speaker 3:  Would you have 5g?

110
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,410
Speaker 4:  You, you wouldn't have 5g. But I think that there's something to be said

111
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:13,100
Speaker 4:  about like how most iPhone se buyers are actually buying their

112
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,970
Speaker 4:  phone and they're not rolling up to apple.com and ordering it there.

113
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,940
Speaker 4:  And they're probably not really ordering it or buying it from the apple store.

114
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,180
Speaker 4:  They're probably buying it through a carrier. And the carrier is like, it's

115
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,110
Speaker 4:  $11 a month for the, and then like into tiniest print, it's $11 a

116
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,140
Speaker 4:  month. And then it says for the rest of your life, but like in the tiniest

117
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,500
Speaker 4:  print. Okay.

118
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,760
Speaker 1:  And then they put you on a 5g plan and that grant is more expensive, even

119
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,540
Speaker 1:  though you don't need it,

120
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,010
Speaker 4:  But what they're not looking at like, oh, this one is 600 or $500

121
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,730
Speaker 4:  versus 430. They're like, this is $11 a month. It's like really cheap.

122
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,570
Speaker 4:  It has all the stuff that I'm familiar with. That's why I'm buying it. But

123
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:51,500
Speaker 4:  like, I, I really also feel like the reason people buy the se the

124
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,620
Speaker 4:  marketing line says they love the home button and it's familiar, but the

125
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,550
Speaker 4:  real line is it's cheap. And that is why it is sell itself. It is

126
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,540
Speaker 4:  purely because it's cheap. If apple made a cheap iPhone

127
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:06,020
Speaker 4:  mini or iPhone 11 design, that was just

128
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,320
Speaker 4:  $400 or $430. That's the one people would buy

129
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,710
Speaker 4:  if it was cheap, it's just because it's cheap. That's the reality of it.

130
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,820
Speaker 3:  Here's my question. iPhone se comes out if they did an

131
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,630
Speaker 3:  iPhone X S E extra L a large iPhone

132
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,530
Speaker 3:  se same price, giant screen. Would that sell

133
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:24,920
Speaker 3:  more?

134
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:25,770
Speaker 1:  Yes.

135
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,840
Speaker 4:  You could tell by just how poor the iPhone mini sales have been. People always

136
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,540
Speaker 4:  choose the bigger screen at the same price. They choose the bigger screen.

137
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,500
Speaker 3:  That's the thing I poke at is what, if this is get a little galaxy

138
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,400
Speaker 3:  brain, what if the reason people don't

139
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,330
Speaker 3:  buy the mini and buy the se is because the se is small,

140
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:51,290
Speaker 3:  but also cheap. And the people who want a small

141
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,590
Speaker 3:  phone also do not care about specs.

142
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Speaker 4:  Well, I think all the people that want a small phone, right? For tech blogs,

143
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,410
Speaker 4:  but that's the entire market.

144
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:07,520
Speaker 4:  I mean like, Alison, not to put you too much on the spot here, but

145
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,180
Speaker 4:  like, you like small phones, which is fair and cool. But what phone do you

146
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:11,540
Speaker 4:  own?

147
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,340
Speaker 7:  That's an iPhone 11.

148
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,360
Speaker 4:  So like,

149
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,020
Speaker 3:  It was the smallest phone you could get. Yeah,

150
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,090
Speaker 1:  That's right Dan. Huh?

151
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,090
Speaker 1:  What now, counselor?

152
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,720
Speaker 3:  I'm just excited to have somebody on the verge cast today who also likes

153
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,800
Speaker 3:  small phones. Yeah, it does. I have been bullied so

154
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,370
Speaker 3:  often by large phone takes unfair.

155
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,700
Speaker 1:  We have a lot of small phone proponents on our staff, but I will just offer

156
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,970
Speaker 1:  you this counterpoint. Yes. My mother was a

157
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:45,530
Speaker 1:  devout Steve jobs fan. Like

158
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,070
Speaker 1:  this woman read the biography when it came out and called me in tears.

159
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,270
Speaker 1:  And she was like, after he left, all the designs went bad and these phones

160
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,490
Speaker 1:  are ugly. And so she wanted to give up her leg

161
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,100
Speaker 1:  last, Steve jobs, iPhone five.

162
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,330
Speaker 5:  I love her.

163
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,650
Speaker 1:  So she held onto for our city, the tiny phone. And then it was time to finally

164
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:08,340
Speaker 1:  give up the phone could not, was not operative anymore.

165
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,730
Speaker 1:  And we went to the store and she was like, I just want a small one. All these

166
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,450
Speaker 1:  phones are too big. They ruined it. Like, this is the conversation I'm having

167
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:19,080
Speaker 1:  in the middle of the pandemic in an apple store. She's like after Steve

168
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,050
Speaker 1:  jobs died, like I can't be here with you.

169
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,250
Speaker 1:  And I was like, no, you don't understand the font size on your phone is out

170
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,060
Speaker 1:  of control. This display scaling on your phone is

171
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,020
Speaker 1:  like, it's tiny screen, huge letters. Like you're reading one word

172
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,680
Speaker 1:  at a time. So I bought her the pro max

173
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,300
Speaker 1:  and it's great. And now she is never going back.

174
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,690
Speaker 1:  She's like, this is the best phone I've ever had. Right. Because it's

175
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:49,260
Speaker 1:  gigantic. And if I could buy her that mid range, like

176
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,220
Speaker 1:  Samsung makes a thousand phones like this, the mid range phone with a

177
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,790
Speaker 1:  huge screen. And that's like their sweet spot. And I feel like apple doesn't

178
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,550
Speaker 1:  have that things. We ended up in this weird conversation with the iPhone

179
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:03,540
Speaker 1:  mini. But if they had that thing, it would be by far and

180
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,410
Speaker 1:  away, the best selling. That's what the 11, the

181
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,980
Speaker 1:  XR was That weirdo phone that they made.

182
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,490
Speaker 4:  I mean, you could look at this, like the history of the iPhone, the iPhone

183
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,480
Speaker 4:  sales didn't really skyrocket until the six plus came out.

184
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,590
Speaker 4:  Apple finally came out with a big screen, iPhone and sales took off. And

185
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,410
Speaker 4:  then the screen has gotten progressively bigger cross the line until they

186
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,900
Speaker 4:  introduced the mini, which no one bought

187
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,620
Speaker 1:  We've gotten, we've gotten so far away. See,

188
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,820
Speaker 1:  see Alex, he's you called it. You're like, this is going to go sideways the

189
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,980
Speaker 1:  se itself house. And tell us about the phone.

190
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,090
Speaker 5:  It's nice. I mean, it really flies. Like there's

191
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:49,050
Speaker 5:  nothing oil. There's very little that I feel like I

192
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:53,040
Speaker 5:  can't do on it that I can do on a thousand dollar phone, which has been

193
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,000
Speaker 5:  the case with the se then it's, that's just kind of,

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,930
Speaker 5:  it's trick is like, this is less than $500 and it does an amazing

195
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,830
Speaker 5:  job. If you look at it purely like in the mid range

196
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,940
Speaker 5:  class, like across Android to it, you know, it gives

197
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,930
Speaker 5:  you IP 67 rating got wireless charging. It's not

198
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,230
Speaker 5:  MagSafe, but you get the cheap charging and that

199
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,980
Speaker 5:  processor it's immediately stand out. It's sort of,

200
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,640
Speaker 5:  it would, it would be a no brainer to me if this

201
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,380
Speaker 5:  screen was a little more modern, but yeah, I

202
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,190
Speaker 5:  just found myself, like, not that the iPhone se

203
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:36,000
Speaker 5:  owners probably going to be doing a lot of gaming, but I'd put

204
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,110
Speaker 5:  tension impact on there. And you're just, your sons are over so much

205
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:44,070
Speaker 5:  on the skinny. I was like peeking around, like, where's

206
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,060
Speaker 5:  my, oh, okay.

207
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,550
Speaker 4:  I thought it was really interesting the way you put it in your review that

208
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,540
Speaker 4:  like just the modern web and modern apps are just not designed for

209
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,450
Speaker 4:  16 by nine, 4.7 inch screen anymore. And that's where everything

210
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,990
Speaker 4:  starts feeling cramped, the gaming example, but like, think about your email

211
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,650
Speaker 4:  app. Like you see what two emails on a screen before you have to start scrolling

212
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,790
Speaker 4:  or, you know, other, other applications that are very standard in like

213
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,480
Speaker 4:  everyday applications are all taking advantage of the

214
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,170
Speaker 4:  wider aspect ratio, the taller screens, because there's more real estate

215
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,290
Speaker 4:  there to play with. And when you don't have that, especially if you're used

216
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,860
Speaker 4:  to it, when you go back to like, like maybe if you know the se buyer or someone

217
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,960
Speaker 4:  who's never had it, they're not used to it. They're known, know what they're

218
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,530
Speaker 4:  missing, but if you're used to it and you try to go back to that, it is like

219
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,560
Speaker 4:  a jarring experience. And I think that's really what came through in your

220
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:29,950
Speaker 4:  review.

221
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,390
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Yeah. I think if you're, if you're coming from an se and it's

222
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,260
Speaker 5:  just time to get a new phone and you want to get this one

223
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,250
Speaker 5:  because you want to hang on to it for the next five or six years, like do

224
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,910
Speaker 5:  it, you will be so happy. But

225
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:49,960
Speaker 5:  yeah, I can't, I can't envision coming from a bigger screen

226
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,200
Speaker 5:  and going to back to the 4.7 inch because

227
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:57,640
Speaker 5:  everything is so tiny. I'm like, I'm doing my duo lingo and

228
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,090
Speaker 5:  I'm like, I can't read the words I need to,

229
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,890
Speaker 5:  I need some kind of new glasses. I don't know. Also getting old.

230
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,120
Speaker 3:  What was the battery life like on it? Cause I think that was like a big question,

231
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,860
Speaker 3:  mark, coming into this.

232
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,250
Speaker 5:  I thought it was fine. Yeah. The previous

233
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:19,300
Speaker 5:  model battery life was a little iffy. It was a, a

234
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,110
Speaker 5:  little dodging. I think whether you could get through a full day

235
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,040
Speaker 5:  of kind of moderate use in my experience, a

236
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,910
Speaker 5:  moderate day, I could get to the end of the day. And I still had enough in

237
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,780
Speaker 5:  the tank to get into some of the next day too. So it

238
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,500
Speaker 5:  definitely, it feels like an improvement to me. I think it's a

239
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,790
Speaker 5:  heavy user. And that was

240
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,610
Speaker 3:  Like with 5g on and doing its thing.

241
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,600
Speaker 5:  Yes. Which 5g is questionable where I live,

242
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:46,990
Speaker 5:  but

243
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,030
Speaker 3:  No millimeter wave.

244
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:53,230
Speaker 1:  I want to come back to the thing you said about five or six years. So it

245
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,680
Speaker 1:  has an, a 15 in it, which is Apple's highest and

246
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:00,670
Speaker 1:  iPhone chip. It does not have an M one L TriNet. It has

247
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,500
Speaker 1:  a 15 in it. Maybe it

248
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:02,980
Speaker 4:  Should,

249
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,100
Speaker 1:  But what this thing needs is 48. GPU's,

250
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,710
Speaker 1:  that's got 15 in it, which, you know, for

251
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:15,580
Speaker 1:  a $430 fund is pretty remarkable. And that's, I think

252
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,580
Speaker 1:  that's an, Apple's really good at software updates over time, much better

253
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,390
Speaker 1:  than any Android phone vendor. So that's where, okay.

254
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,750
Speaker 1:  Five or six years, or this phone sounds really reasonable. And that's why

255
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,710
Speaker 1:  you put the really high-end chip in there because you're expecting

256
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,680
Speaker 1:  people to hold onto it for a long time. But I was just put that right next

257
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,610
Speaker 1:  to what you're saying about the screen, which is already feel small

258
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,540
Speaker 1:  for the current state of web in apps, six years from now,

259
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:44,440
Speaker 1:  like this trend is not slowing down like six years from now

260
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,920
Speaker 1:  who knows, like every developer could be assuming that your phone

261
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,280
Speaker 1:  unfolds to become a much larger screen,

262
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,310
Speaker 1:  which is right. And like, I don't know that's going to happen, but you just

263
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,880
Speaker 1:  see the trend line is when we make fancy features on the

264
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,840
Speaker 1:  website, right. We like test them out. And we T we, we know the, most of

265
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,680
Speaker 1:  our readers are mobile, but we just sort of assume they have big phones because

266
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,340
Speaker 1:  that's what the data tells us. And so you just keep this trend

267
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:14,150
Speaker 1:  going, and it's like, soon, you will not be able to read the web

268
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,710
Speaker 1:  on your tiny phone. The processor will be there. And maybe the, you

269
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,770
Speaker 1:  know, the mobile network speed will be there, but you're just going to get

270
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,590
Speaker 1:  completely left behind by the screen size. This is the first time I've thought

271
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,760
Speaker 1:  about that with an iPhone.

272
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:30,020
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And I felt so I, so I dug out

273
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,980
Speaker 5:  the 2016 iPhone se I put iOS 15 on it,

274
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,600
Speaker 5:  which worked. And, but I was going through something on

275
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,440
Speaker 5:  Instagram and I was trying to light something

276
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,400
Speaker 5:  that someone like damn to me. And I physically couldn't. It was

277
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:50,950
Speaker 5:  like a real estate that I needed to be hitting on this

278
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,740
Speaker 5:  green, just like didn't exist. And it was sort of like,

279
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,000
Speaker 5:  yeah, this is what this is maybe going to come to in five

280
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,330
Speaker 5:  years when you're on your 4.7 inch screen, and everybody else

281
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:06,560
Speaker 5:  has the folding, whatever. And it just kind of

282
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,490
Speaker 5:  sucks. It's like, that is the really cool thing about this phone is you think,

283
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,700
Speaker 5:  keep it for so long. And it's this

284
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:17,600
Speaker 5:  2016 se is running iOS 15

285
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,680
Speaker 5:  fine, but it's, it's like the modern web

286
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,540
Speaker 5:  has been as Dawn. So

287
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,250
Speaker 1:  Let's talk about the camera real quick. It's got the single camera, no nightmare,

288
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,960
Speaker 1:  which seems like a real miss to me.

289
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:34,310
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And it's, it just seems to be a choice on

290
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,270
Speaker 5:  Apple's part, because I can't imagine that the processors,

291
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,120
Speaker 5:  there are other phones with this processor that have night mode that

292
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,930
Speaker 5:  kind of stinks. There's, there's a lot of mid-range phones on

293
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:51,830
Speaker 5:  Android that have perfectly decent night modes and

294
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,150
Speaker 5:  cost about the same amount of money have less fancy processors.

295
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,230
Speaker 5:  So that, that sticks out a little bit. It is the same

296
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:04,160
Speaker 5:  camera hardware as the previous generation, still a

297
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,790
Speaker 5:  single camera, which doesn't bother me a lot. I think

298
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,990
Speaker 5:  people probably aren't buying it for the camera, or they're not

299
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,130
Speaker 5:  super interested in, in an ultra wide or

300
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,820
Speaker 5:  kind of messing with a lot of settings. Maybe, maybe you are, but

301
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,930
Speaker 5:  what you do get is pretty good. I mean, it's an iPhone camera it's

302
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,950
Speaker 5:  it does what it does very well. And video recording is

303
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,680
Speaker 5:  very good, especially in the mid-range class.

304
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,070
Speaker 1:  Do you think it's on par with the iPhone 11, for example,

305
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,760
Speaker 5:  It's pretty close. Yeah. I think that, I think the night mode is

306
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,310
Speaker 5:  I do, I do. In fact,

307
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:47,480
Speaker 1:  The 11 is when I stopped using my RX 100 as much. That's that's and I know

308
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,070
Speaker 1:  that's the fun you have. So that's like the comparison making, when the 11

309
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,030
Speaker 1:  came out, I noticed that I slowly stopped using my RX 100, as much

310
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,240
Speaker 1:  as I had been, other than the tennis looked horrible. So that's probably

311
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,870
Speaker 1:  like embedded in my brain. So this is like, goes back to the

312
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,310
Speaker 1:  thing about the wall street journal audience, like the update, you can bring

313
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,050
Speaker 1:  an audience it's like, the camera is way better and you don't have to think

314
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:10,380
Speaker 1:  about it or you can zoom. Right. Cause

315
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,120
Speaker 1:  that, that breaks people's brains that you can zoom in an iPhone, but it

316
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,090
Speaker 1:  makes the image quality worse, like significantly worse in digital zoom.

317
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,900
Speaker 1:  And that to me is just like adding Nymo to this would have effectively been

318
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,710
Speaker 1:  free. It would have blown every other mid-range phone out of the

319
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,640
Speaker 1:  water and everyone could have seen that they got something

320
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,610
Speaker 1:  cool. And it just seems like such an odd feature omission.

321
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,850
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I, I can't figure it out. And there's sort of like a

322
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:40,980
Speaker 5:  theory. If you look at the product cycle, it was four

323
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,340
Speaker 5:  years between the first two versions of those phone and then

324
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,720
Speaker 5:  two years. So this has made me like the S

325
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,620
Speaker 5:  eight S is one theory on it. But

326
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,450
Speaker 5:  like maybe in another two years, we're going to get, you know, that, that

327
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,980
Speaker 5:  more, a bigger screen you're going to get,

328
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:03,120
Speaker 3:  Could they do it as a software update? Like, could we, could they just

329
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,790
Speaker 3:  announce it when they announced all the other iPhones and be like, and by

330
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,410
Speaker 3:  the way, this one's getting mode,

331
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,590
Speaker 1:  Are you, you D when iOS 16 comes out,

332
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,080
Speaker 1:  Like we've added, who knows?

333
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,500
Speaker 5:  That would be great. I don't know, write to your Senator

334
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,760
Speaker 1:  Right. To your Senator. And okay. I want to end this by complaining with

335
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,990
Speaker 1:  the New York times, which I've been

336
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,510
Speaker 1:  quietly vibrating in the background ready to do so I don't understand what's

337
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,360
Speaker 1:  going on at the times, review I'm certain the person who had served you is

338
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,510
Speaker 1:  lovely. The New York times has fully decided

339
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:37,680
Speaker 1:  that people should not care about their smartphone cameras. Like they

340
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,440
Speaker 1:  just don't think many people care about better pictures. So they wrote this

341
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,100
Speaker 1:  review of, of the se. And I just want to read this line to you

342
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,730
Speaker 1:  and you tell me what you think. Cause I think it is bonkers.

343
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,140
Speaker 1:  So it's all the stuff you probably want. This one or $30 phone. If you meet

344
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,230
Speaker 1:  this, any of these criteria, you don't care about features like ultra Fest

345
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,380
Speaker 1:  cellular fine. You correctly recognize that smartphone technology has been

346
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,110
Speaker 1:  around for so long. You should be paying less for it. Fine. And then there's

347
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:04,860
Speaker 1:  this line. You don't care about what the number of camera lenses or

348
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,850
Speaker 1:  pixels on a screen, tell your friends and colleagues about your

349
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,780
Speaker 1:  wealth. And I'm just like, yeah. I mean, okay. Maybe I

350
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,650
Speaker 1:  just want to flex like my ranger over keys in the club

351
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:20,580
Speaker 1:  with my iPhone, that anybody can buy. I'm

352
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,140
Speaker 1:  sure. That's just who I've been. But like the number of lenses it's

353
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,100
Speaker 1:  like that helps you take better pictures. And

354
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:33,000
Speaker 1:  like all anybody cares about these phones anymore is like the

355
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,030
Speaker 1:  cameras. It's like, when we do reviews, what are all the questions we get

356
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,050
Speaker 1:  our cameras and maybe that's our audience at Southwestern, all journalists.

357
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:43,260
Speaker 1:  And other times, I just don't understand this approach to this review.

358
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,680
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's kind of news to me. If like multiple cameras on a

359
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,520
Speaker 5:  phone is a status thing. There's a lot of

360
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,830
Speaker 5:  fun. I have a lot of cameras. I don't know.

361
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:58,240
Speaker 4:  I'm only carrying that Nokia nine preview around,

362
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,160
Speaker 4:  it's got six camera lenses on the back.

363
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,570
Speaker 3:  That's the last time a phone was considered one like a

364
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,530
Speaker 3:  status symbol, right? Like 20 14, 20 15, when

365
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:12,100
Speaker 3:  they're like, we're making these phones for billionaires. And then we stop.

366
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:16,270
Speaker 4:  I, I think there's something about like folding phones, folding phones, when

367
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,370
Speaker 4:  people see that, that it's different. They like,

368
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,970
Speaker 1:  That's just the form factor. Eventually. I'll be like, I'm just telling you

369
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:26,020
Speaker 1:  it. And I haven't rolled up in the, in a one time. But if you roll up in

370
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,500
Speaker 1:  the club and you're like, I haven't, I phone 13, bro, like

371
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,240
Speaker 1:  shit is not gonna work.

372
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:35,410
Speaker 3:  You don't have a broken iPhone 13 pro because the bouncer will

373
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,850
Speaker 3:  throw into the ground.

374
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:42,040
Speaker 1:  Like I have the fanciest Toyota Camry that has ever been.

375
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,560
Speaker 5:  So yeah, it's not hard. I mean, mid-range funds will just

376
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,190
Speaker 5:  like pack on my camera lenses, like have a

377
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:54,820
Speaker 5:  macro lens on my phone. Like that's not really gonna get you

378
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,990
Speaker 5:  anywhere special.

379
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,800
Speaker 1:  Well, yeah, for whatever reason, the fact that the times is decided that

380
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,910
Speaker 1:  good photos, it's not a thing that fund buyers should care about. It just

381
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:07,960
Speaker 1:  breaks my brain completely. And then the idea that the number of lenses

382
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,230
Speaker 1:  are signifier of wealth. And that is the only reason you should care about

383
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:15,130
Speaker 1:  the number of lenses is just like, no, one's rolling

384
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,390
Speaker 1:  up with a light show, camera

385
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,120
Speaker 1:  96 lens.

386
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,220
Speaker 4:  I'm just, I just looked at the back of my iPhone and now I'm very confident

387
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:28,180
Speaker 4:  in my family's hereditary wealth for the next few generations.

388
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,470
Speaker 1:  I honestly think like apple should at my request is like add night

389
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:39,190
Speaker 1:  mode to the camera. The people who buy this phone will probably be

390
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,710
Speaker 1:  happier if they take better photos in low light.

391
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,700
Speaker 5:  Absolutely.

392
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,210
Speaker 1:  That's like the main thing that is confounding to people. Yeah.

393
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,630
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That's a little one. I don't get, I don't buy any good

394
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:53,380
Speaker 5:  explanation from apple. Just put night load on it. I'll

395
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,960
Speaker 5:  start a campaign. I'll start a letter writing campaign.

396
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:59,710
Speaker 1:  Can I, can I tell you what the time said about photography? That's

397
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,550
Speaker 4:  My favorite list.

398
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,620
Speaker 1:  They said you can always just use the flash.

399
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,730
Speaker 5:  Oh,

400
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,560
Speaker 1:  Just you're technically true. You can and make

401
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,550
Speaker 1:  everything into some sort of bizarre nineties Cobra, snake, photo shoot.

402
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,250
Speaker 1:  That is a choice you have, you can make your children look like they are

403
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,520
Speaker 1:  completely strung out at any moment of the day

404
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:26,680
Speaker 1:  by shooting photos of them, especially your led flash on an

405
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,650
Speaker 1:  iPhone. Anyway, that is confounding. I just want to complain about it because

406
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,460
Speaker 1:  I can't let it go.

407
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,540
Speaker 4:  I just want to clarify you can't always use the flash because like the iPhone

408
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:38,230
Speaker 4:  has auto or off on the flash. So the iPhone decides whether you can use the

409
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:38,800
Speaker 4:  flash or not.

410
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,150
Speaker 3:  Well, you put it in video mode

411
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,660
Speaker 4:  And then, and then you just have the light on

412
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:43,910
Speaker 1:  The

413
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,360
Speaker 4:  Flashlight and then you take a picture.

414
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:50,480
Speaker 1:  What you wanna do is you want to switch. You're already behind the curve.

415
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,290
Speaker 1:  Camera two it's 10 80 P video mode. It

416
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,190
Speaker 4:  Does 4k.

417
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,270
Speaker 1:  It does 4k

418
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:01,100
Speaker 4:  That's. What's so baffling about it. It records 4k video. That's better than

419
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,790
Speaker 4:  like basically any Android phone you can buy, but they didn't put night mode

420
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,060
Speaker 4:  in it.

421
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:09,110
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Utterly baffling. I love it. And also, because this is like

422
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,060
Speaker 1:  full on 4k 60. Yes.

423
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,580
Speaker 1:  In the base storage is what? 32 gigs for C4. Okay. So you can

424
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,020
Speaker 1:  record 10 minutes, 4k 6,000.

425
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,560
Speaker 1:  That's great. I love it. All right. That's the iPhone se

426
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,730
Speaker 1:  I will complain about the New York times more at a later date. Rest is

427
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,230
Speaker 1:  short. I can do it at the drop,

428
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,610
Speaker 1:  but Alison, thank you so much. It was a great review. You were just saying

429
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,700
Speaker 1:  there's another Samsung phone, like a mid-range Samsung phone. That's worth

430
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,350
Speaker 1:  comparing to us, right? That's on the side now.

431
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:43,490
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Samsung just announced a 53 5 gene,

432
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,750
Speaker 5:  which is a 52 5g last year mid-ranged

433
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:51,410
Speaker 5:  phone and about 500 bucks. I, I thought it was really the

434
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:55,110
Speaker 5:  best bet for that price range on Android.

435
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,060
Speaker 5:  So they announced the newest version. It is

436
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,900
Speaker 5:  $50 cheaper, which puts it in just under the

437
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,320
Speaker 5:  iPhone se at the 128 gigabyte

438
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:10,100
Speaker 5:  storage level. So wonder if they're doing a

439
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,660
Speaker 5:  little like undercutting there.

440
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:12,710
Speaker 4:  How big is the screen?

441
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:16,730
Speaker 5:  It's much bigger. It's a 6.5 inch. I

442
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,090
Speaker 5:  believe it.

443
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:19,850
Speaker 4:  An iPhone se

444
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,870
Speaker 5:  You could fit several iPhone se than to it,

445
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:28,880
Speaker 5:  but it's, it's the closest thing I think to in

446
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,270
Speaker 5:  there, they're getting there on the software updates to their

447
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:36,200
Speaker 5:  promising four years of Android OS updates

448
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,160
Speaker 5:  in their five years of security updates. So I feel like Samsung

449
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,940
Speaker 5:  is like slowly chipping away at what was just

450
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,810
Speaker 5:  kind of like a Guinea for the iPhone. Se was like, you're going to get all

451
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:51,080
Speaker 5:  these years. And software updates is super cheap and it

452
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:54,770
Speaker 5:  is, you know, built really well. So that's one to watch. I'm really

453
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:58,730
Speaker 5:  interested in trying it out and word on the street also

454
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,510
Speaker 5:  is that it does not have millimeter wave just like the iPhone se

455
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,790
Speaker 5:  and will also be sold at Verizon

456
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,620
Speaker 5:  Because our nightmare is over.

457
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,100
Speaker 1:  Oh, Allison, before you go, do you have a, do you have like an Iran update

458
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,740
Speaker 1:  for every time you're on. I'm like I got to ask there's one person who cares

459
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,300
Speaker 1:  about Iran. As much as me. It's Allison.

460
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,020
Speaker 5:  I have no update. I

461
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,310
Speaker 5:  do. We have a fourth wireless carrier in this country.

462
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:28,790
Speaker 5:  No.

463
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:29,900
Speaker 1:  Alright. Just

464
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,570
Speaker 1:  around the clock dish network, four years ago, dish network promises store.

465
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,610
Speaker 3:  We're going to do an emergency verge cast. When Iran finally happens,

466
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:41,570
Speaker 1:  We should

467
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,530
Speaker 3:  Absolutely.

468
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:46,290
Speaker 1:  The project Genesis Genesis Vergecast it's Jenna

469
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:49,860
Speaker 1:  five says by the way that we're going to be onto like the six G hype cycle

470
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,850
Speaker 1:  by the time, you know, it's going to be very depressing. All right,

471
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,690
Speaker 1:  Alison, thank you so much for joining the show. We'll be right back with

Speaker 1:  live it's 2007 and people are hustling. Two roommates need some

487
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:56,490
Speaker 1:  cash. They start renting an air mattress in their apartment. Strangers stay

488
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:59,670
Speaker 1:  with them. Those roommates earn some extra spending money. And Airbnb is

489
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:03,090
Speaker 1:  born. You know what happened? Next? That little tech company exploded with

490
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,690
Speaker 1:  rentals available in more than 100,000 cities. But one of those cities was

491
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,620
Speaker 1:  prepared to go to battle on behalf of renters and hotels to keep Airbnb

492
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,190
Speaker 1:  at bay business wars from wonder is a podcast that looks at the world's biggest

493
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:17,790
Speaker 1:  company rivals their new season, Airbnb versus New York city examines. How

494
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:21,390
Speaker 1:  that struggle became a symbol for the tug of war between startups and regulators.

495
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,750
Speaker 1:  It started as a clever way to earn a little extra cash, quickly transformed

496
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,870
Speaker 1:  into something a lot more complicated. She'll get into impact the housing

497

00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:34,980
Speaker 1:  of Airbnb into their city, the tech giant refused to back down and that's

Speaker 1:  We're back. Monica chin is here. Hey Monica. Hello. It's good to see

503
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:52,650
Speaker 1:  you. I feel like we've been talking every minute of the day for the past

504
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:56,610
Speaker 1:  week about these reviews. So Monica got the

505
00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:00,600
Speaker 1:   ultra max studio and the studio display

506
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,560
Speaker 1:  with a nano texture coating. And then I had the M

507
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:08,490
Speaker 1:  one max max studio and the regular studio display with the regular coding.

508
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,940
Speaker 1:  And I mostly just had benchmarks and then gave the computer to Monica. So

509
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:15,840
Speaker 1:  she did all the computer review stuff along with our amazing video and

510
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,650
Speaker 1:  art teams. And I mostly just see all the, with webcams. So

511
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:23,340
Speaker 1:  let's start with the computers. It

512
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:27,270
Speaker 1:  seems Monica like apple has pulled off a chip design

513
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,110
Speaker 1:  dream with this MUN ultra and then package it in a computer that everyone

514
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,070
Speaker 1:  seems to be very happy with.

515
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:36,300
Speaker 9:  Yep. That's pretty much right. Basically, you know, for years

516
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,990
Speaker 9:  and years and years people, various companies have been trying to take two

517
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:43,450
Speaker 9:  GPU's and make them into one GPU. And

518
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,800
Speaker 9:  it's, you know, usually you just put two GPU's or two

519
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,340
Speaker 9:  chips on one board and you put it in the system and then you

520
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:55,060
Speaker 9:  basically say the software has to figure out how to make those

521
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,960
Speaker 9:  two GPU's work together. And that's really difficult to

522
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,810
Speaker 9:  automate because they really need to be in sync with each other. Like if

523
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:05,500
Speaker 9:  they're, if one of them is not rendering things, when it's supposed

524
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,950
Speaker 9:  to, it can throw everything off. So usually what programs do is they just

525
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:12,610
Speaker 9:  have the two GPU's like do separate things. So Apple's

526
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:16,630
Speaker 9:  taken two M one maxes. They've used this technique called ultra fusion

527
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:20,320
Speaker 9:  to put them into one GPU. But the difference here and what

528
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,250
Speaker 9:  we haven't seen done successfully at this scale before is that

529
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,060
Speaker 9:  they are actually presenting themselves as one chip. So, so like a

530
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,990
Speaker 9:  software we'll see them as one chip and it will just give them a

531
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:35,980
Speaker 9:  task and they will do the task and divide it between themselves. So the software

532
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,590
Speaker 9:  doesn't have to do anything. You, the user do not have to do anything manually.

533
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:42,790
Speaker 9:  It, they just work as one chip. There's a 2.5 terabytes of data

534
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:46,660
Speaker 9:  like going between them or that that's the bandwidth that it supports. So

535
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:50,500
Speaker 9:  these things are able to talk to each other and to Macko S

536
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,610
Speaker 9:  at like a speed that we just have not seen before. And that's like a

537
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,440
Speaker 9:  crazy amount of power that they've put in this thing.

538
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,980
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I would say that the clarification I make, I think I'm pretty sure

539
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,890
Speaker 1:  Macalester is helping a lot here. Like the, you know,

540
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:06,550
Speaker 1:  the promise of all apple things that is on the hardware and the software.

541
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:10,600
Speaker 1:  So it seems like, yep, they've done this ultra fusion chip

542
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,440
Speaker 1:  design technique, which she talked about a bit last

543
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,410
Speaker 1:  week. Right? They've assembled the chips in this way. That seems to be more

544
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:21,040
Speaker 1:  prevalent, but they've actually pulled it off. And then between the

545
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,970
Speaker 1:  chip and the operating system application

546
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:28,030
Speaker 1:  like Adobe premiere, which is always the one that comes up when we do these

547
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:31,600
Speaker 1:  reviews does not need to be, it's just

548
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,740
Speaker 1:  seamless for it.

549
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:36,130
Speaker 3:  Yeah. You didn't have to like actually do anything. Cause I know a lot of

550
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:39,130
Speaker 3:  times when you do these kinds of things, you have to tinker, right. Like

551
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:42,940
Speaker 3:  to get, sometimes somebody will see it. One program will be like, oh

552
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:46,360
Speaker 3:  yeah, I see these, this, these two things is one. And sometimes you'll have

553
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,140
Speaker 3:  to spend 40 hours downloading drivers and installing them. And this just

554
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:53,050
Speaker 3:  like you turned on premier and premier, I was like, oh, Hey, cool. You have

555
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:55,540
Speaker 3:  the new, like, did you have to update premiere? Did you have to do, like,

556
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:59,440
Speaker 9:  We were never asked to do anything that like, I would have thought we

557
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:03,340
Speaker 9:  did not have to do on the Maxim machine. You don't have to divide anything

558
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:03,760
Speaker 9:  manually.

559
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,390
Speaker 3:  You didn't have to like reach out to Adobe and be like, send me a special

560
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,560
Speaker 3:  updated version

561
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,110
Speaker 9:  For a dual GBU set up. No, we did not. That's

562
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:14,080
Speaker 3:  Cool. That is super cool.

563
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:14,920
Speaker 9:  It worked out of the

564
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,660
Speaker 3:  Box. That is really awesome.

565
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:20,740
Speaker 1:  I mean, that's the dream. Every other time we've done a

566
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,640
Speaker 1:  pro review of a Mac and we've done the game. And

567
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,240
Speaker 1:  Monica, you mentioned this scenario view, like we've just like give the thing

568
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,140
Speaker 1:  to people. And then they like complain. Like it doesn't

569
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,560
Speaker 1:  seem faster. Or in particular creative

570
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:39,740
Speaker 1:  cloud is like not updated. And it's usually like apple wacky

571
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,780
Speaker 1:  GPU ideas. And no one else gives a shit.

572
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:46,850
Speaker 9:  Yeah. I mean, it was real. It's really interesting. Like I honestly think,

573
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:49,040
Speaker 9:  you know, we have all these benchmarks, whatever. I think the most telling

574
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,730
Speaker 9:  thing is you watch the Mac pro review where we gave this device to

575
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:56,540
Speaker 9:  like all kinds of podcast people and music, people, and artists, and

576
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:59,840
Speaker 9:  they all use it across the board. They're all like, this is not any faster.

577
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,370
Speaker 9:  And we gave this studio to our art

578
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:08,150
Speaker 9:  director, our illustrator, our audio engineer, people like that,

579
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:11,330
Speaker 9:  every single one of them used it for like five minutes, said this is so fast

580
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,540
Speaker 9:  that the reactions were just opposite ends of the scale.

581
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,460
Speaker 3:  Was that the ultra or the

582
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,840
Speaker 9:  Max that was the ultra.

583
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,660
Speaker 3:  And that's like the super high end.

584
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:23,300
Speaker 1:  So that, that ultra that you had was the 20 core CPU with

585
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,290
Speaker 1:  64 GPU cores. Yup. The fascinating thing about all

586
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:30,620
Speaker 1:  of this is these cores are the same across the M one line,

587
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,970
Speaker 1:  right? So when we do benchmarks and we do like single threaded

588
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:37,850
Speaker 1:  CPU tasks, you can buy that

589
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:42,140
Speaker 1:  $8,000 computer. But if you have a single threaded or a single core

590
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,450
Speaker 1:  task, it's as fast as like the Mac book air.

591
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:47,330
Speaker 9:  Yeah. I mean that we would really need a revolution in architecture and see

592
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:50,680
Speaker 9:  those increased, which, you know, we might very well get, but those are what

593
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,350
Speaker 9:  we were expecting here.

594
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:55,220
Speaker 1:  I mean, the thing about this computer to me and this came up in the

595
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,400
Speaker 1:  review is the chip is fast, but it is

596
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,030
Speaker 1:  consistently, the ultra is two X as

597
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:05,930
Speaker 1:  fast as the max, which is already a very fast chip on the

598
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:06,530
Speaker 1:  benchmark,

599
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,620
Speaker 9:  But in the multi-core benchmarks like sedimentary, multi poorer and geek

600
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,410
Speaker 9:  bench, multi court, you know, that's, and that's what you'd expect that has

601
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:14,810
Speaker 9:  twice the course, you know, it's going to do it, but it, you know, it is

602
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:18,140
Speaker 9:  impressive that, you know, apple got that right. And it was

603
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,160
Speaker 9:  delivering the twice, the cores of w core twice

604
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,910
Speaker 9:  the score on the multi-core benchmarks that as opposed to, in terms of like

605
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:28,970
Speaker 9:  real world tasks that we'd ran, we were not seeing that. Like we were not

606
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:32,150
Speaker 9:  always seeing double the scores on tomb Raider. We were not seeing double

607
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:35,210
Speaker 9:  the scores on like huge or bench for premiere reputed venture after effects.

608
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:39,320
Speaker 9:  So, which I think just underscores that, you know, these are systems

609
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:43,220
Speaker 9:  and these are software. And you know, if you're not using a

610
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:46,730
Speaker 9:  software that doesn't effectively scale to every available

611
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:50,390
Speaker 9:  core or, you know, effectively utilize all that GPU

612
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:54,050
Speaker 9:  power, you're not necessarily going to be seeing that benefit. But the

613
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,680
Speaker 9:  ultra was a little bit faster than the max. That was the impression that

614
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,430
Speaker 9:  we got from the various professionals who use this for us. It was like

615
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:05,270
Speaker 9:  noticeably faster for them, but it was not either, they didn't

616
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:09,170
Speaker 9:  feel it was twice as fast or the max is already so fast that like

617
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,190
Speaker 9:  having that time is not like super, did not like change their lives.

618
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:16,820
Speaker 4:  It seems like a lot of the folks that you were working with were coming from

619
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,300
Speaker 4:  Intel based machines, right? Like their everyday I know Becca is daily drivers,

620
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,290
Speaker 4:  the old Mac pro

621
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:25,370
Speaker 1:  The old Macro-Pro $14,000 computer that we

622
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:25,700
Speaker 1:  bought

623
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:29,050
Speaker 4:  $17,000 Mac pro it's a

624
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,320
Speaker 4:  crusty old crusty two year old machine of ours that

625
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,730
Speaker 4:  we spent a salary on.

626
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:40,110
Speaker 4:  She works on that, which is Intel base. I know Andrew works on an Intel based

627
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:43,830
Speaker 4:  machine. Alex Castro, the illustrator, he works on an Intel-based

628
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:47,280
Speaker 4:  PC that he was comparing us. So they were seeing these huge

629
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,210
Speaker 4:  advantage advantages coming to this desktop form factor that they had not

630
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:55,170
Speaker 4:  seen before. But I just wonder how much of that was because they were moving

631
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:58,980
Speaker 4:  from Intel to apple Silicon now. And like, there, there

632
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:02,730
Speaker 4:  might be like diminishing returns between the max and the ultra, you

633
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:06,720
Speaker 4:  know, because the big leap is going from Intel to apple

634
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,350
Speaker 4:  Silicon. Right.

635
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,280
Speaker 1:  Dan, I think that point is like, well taken, although I'm not sure.

636
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:15,720
Speaker 1:  This is what I think about. Apple's wacky GPU ideas. Part of the

637
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,590
Speaker 1:  jump to apple. Silicon was all these, all these apps. When

638
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:23,280
Speaker 1:  they move to apple, Silicon, they started using metal. They started actually

639
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,760
Speaker 1:  taking advantage of the GPU's and then the GPS were not

640
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:30,840
Speaker 1:  wacky old AMD GPU's or wacky, Intel

641
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,300
Speaker 1:  integrated GPU's are like reasonably good. It's a

642
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,100
Speaker 9:  Little kooky AMD shifts. Yeah.

643
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,130
Speaker 1:  Almost like, what do you got? And he was like, I know it's a weird shit.

644
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:42,180
Speaker 1:  Like, so like, I feel like the chips themselves are more powerful.

645
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:45,510
Speaker 1:  Then now what you're seeing is Apple's approach to

646
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:49,380
Speaker 1:  GPU's beyond just the wacky parts is no longer this like wacky

647
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:53,130
Speaker 1:  idea that they're just going to throw more like GPU

648
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:56,490
Speaker 1:  chips at the problem. They're just gonna make the GPU itself

649
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,930
Speaker 1:  bigger and addressed as a single device, and

650
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:04,500
Speaker 1:  then figure out how to distribute across courts. And I think that that feels

651
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,400
Speaker 1:  scalable. Like that's why you see that the two X and the benchmarks.

652
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:12,270
Speaker 3:  Well, it's scalable in a really a way that's gotta to be super frustrating

653
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,720
Speaker 3:  for AMD and Nvidia because notoriously

654
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:19,620
Speaker 3:  GPU makers do not like to talk about they don't they're like, they're

655
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:23,150
Speaker 3:  not course. We don't talk about threads. We talk about compute units or where

656
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,180
Speaker 3:  they make up some other word,

657
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:26,100
Speaker 1:  The chip industry doing weird graphs.

658
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,330
Speaker 3:  That's crazy.

659
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,440
Speaker 9:  It's more seen that before,

660
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:32,670
Speaker 3:  But Nvidia and AMD are like very particular about this. If you try to say,

661
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,850
Speaker 3:  oh, this has got 56 or 64, they're going to be like, no, no, no. That doesn't

662
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:39,570
Speaker 3:  matter. Nvidia in particular is like, that doesn't matter. And apple is saying,

663
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,500
Speaker 3:  no, actually these do matter. Here are really measurable differences.

664
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:47,610
Speaker 3:  When you bolt twice, the number of GPU cores on you're going to

665
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:51,390
Speaker 3:  see, you know, close to twice the performance and

666
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:55,200
Speaker 3:  that's gotta be a little scary for the GPU industry, right? Like

667
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,420
Speaker 3:  somebody is kind of calling them out.

668
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:01,230
Speaker 9:  I mean, another thing not to overlook here is that Adobe has, at this point

669
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:04,710
Speaker 9:  had like two years to get its shit

670
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:08,640
Speaker 9:  together. When it comes to making its programs run really well

671
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,060
Speaker 9:  on apple devices. And that like prior to

672
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:15,900
Speaker 9:   being released, we had been saying for years, like all

673
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,480
Speaker 9:  these apple products are really good. The cruise three doesn't run well on

674
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,840
Speaker 9:  them. It's full of bugs. Like on our Mac purview, it was like breaking everyone's

675
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,560
Speaker 9:  plugins. Now we have a bunch of these programs that

676
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:29,730
Speaker 9:  are professionals we're using have been made and optimized to

677
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:33,660
Speaker 9:  run on the M one chip. And that allowed, I

678
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,600
Speaker 9:  think these devices to unlock potential in those

679
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,560
Speaker 9:  programs that like previous apple machines just haven't been able to

680
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,830
Speaker 9:  do because the software hasn't been focused on that area for awhile.

681
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:49,180
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I will say that the Adobes, the big stuff has

682
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:53,170
Speaker 1:  moved over. Right? So parts of premiere parts of

683
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:57,160
Speaker 1:  after effects, parts of Photoshop that like 90% of

684
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,730
Speaker 1:  that stuff is optimized. There were the you're mentioning Puget bench.

685
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:04,300
Speaker 1:  People don't know here's your benches basically like they're a systems vendor,

686
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,180
Speaker 1:  but they sell a bunch of benchmarking plugins so that then they can sell

687
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,600
Speaker 1:  you a faster machine to make their benchmarks go higher. It's a great business

688
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,230
Speaker 1:  model. Some of the best marketing I've ever seen, but they're

689
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:18,100
Speaker 1:  plugins that run these benchmarks in Adobe programs are basically just like

690
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:21,820
Speaker 1:  automations. Right? You download a bunch of assets. You like run the

691
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,830
Speaker 1:  plugin at times. How fast

692
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,130
Speaker 9:  Actually really fun to watch it. Cause it takes control of your mouse for

693
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:30,280
Speaker 9:  like half an hour. It just plays around in premiere. And you can just watch

694
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,130
Speaker 9:  and try to figure out what it's doing. It's like making, it's like throwing

695
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:36,820
Speaker 9:  like effects on the pictures, like making them all green for no reason.

696
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,010
Speaker 9:  And then it gives you a number of the end. It's really?

697
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:42,100
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And it's like, we're going to run a GPU heavy effect. And it's like,

698
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,950
Speaker 1:  what we're going to do is take this video clip and make it look ridiculous,

699
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:47,200
Speaker 1:  like, right. It's just like nuts

700
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:49,870
Speaker 9:  For all the colors. It's like, oh yes. As one does

701
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:54,310
Speaker 1:  Like you do. But it was like Photoshop or it was Photoshop that

702
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:58,090
Speaker 1:  we couldn't run the benchmark because that part of Photoshop was not

703
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:01,780
Speaker 1:  available on apple Silicon yet. Right. Right. And there's like, there are

704
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:05,020
Speaker 1:  these weird corner cases where the transition is complete, but to your point,

705
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,370
Speaker 1:  it is mostly complete. And it's mostly pretty good. I think

706
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:12,610
Speaker 1:  the question about, do you get the  ultra? Like if you know, you need this

707
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:16,240
Speaker 1:  computer, which I think now our entire video team fully in their heart

708
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,360
Speaker 1:  believes they need this computer. Right. You're probably good enough right

709
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,700
Speaker 1:  now with the max. Right. That's like basically what we saw.

710
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,660
Speaker 9:  Yeah. So no one who we talked to thought that the max was inadequate

711
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:29,440
Speaker 9:  for their workflows, but you know, they would have all chosen to be on the

712
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,830
Speaker 9:  ultra if they could. I think Alice Castro illustrator said something to me

713
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:36,040
Speaker 9:  that was like, yeah, like the max would be great for my work. I think if

714
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,800
Speaker 9:  I really wanted to take it to the next level, I'd want to be on the ultra

715
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,960
Speaker 1:  Alex, just like drafting the email to request a, your computer. I know all

716
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,110
Speaker 1:  this

717
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:46,720
Speaker 10:  Art we could have if you just gave me an

718
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,280
Speaker 1:  Ultra wandering the halls.

719
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:52,350
Speaker 9:  I think like, you know, if you're someone who really needs every last ounce

720
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:55,210
Speaker 9:  speeding yet what some people do and some people do want to pay for that,

721
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:59,110
Speaker 9:  then, you know, the ultra will be like a millisecond faster on,

722
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:02,950
Speaker 9:  on various things that you're doing, which does add up in your, in your workflow.

723
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,770
Speaker 9:  But no one was using the maximum is like, oh, this is slow. Like the max

724
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:07,360
Speaker 9:  is also like very, very fast.

725
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:11,470
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Well, so the ultra is twice as expensive. So I would just connect this

726
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,230
Speaker 1:  to our iPhone, a C conversation, which we were just having Monica, which

727
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:18,160
Speaker 1:  is like, the thing will last a long time. So I think a good, like a good

728
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,730
Speaker 1:  question is how long do you expect to keep this computer?

729
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:26,020
Speaker 1:  If it's a long time, then having the

730
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,410
Speaker 1:  performance had removed, the ultra might well be worth it. As things get

731
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:33,230
Speaker 1:  more demanding. If you're running some sort of

732
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:37,040
Speaker 1:  tax scheme and you're just like flipping computers every two years, I've

733
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,520
Speaker 1:  never run anything.

734
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,470
Speaker 4:  I mean, studios like studios do flip computers every couple of years, right?

735
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,160
Speaker 1:  Tax schemes,

736
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:46,460
Speaker 4:  They run the tax scheme. But like, they're the ones that are going to buy

737
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,270
Speaker 4:  the alternate, right? Like if you're doing a production, maybe

738
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:53,960
Speaker 4:  are, you know, Vox, media produces Netflix shows.

739
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,890
Speaker 4:  Maybe those teams really want these ultras because they

740
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,520
Speaker 4:  have a lot of production work to do. But if you're a consumer like

741
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:05,300
Speaker 4:  us and you're doing, and even if you're doing like heavy consumer work,

742
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:08,120
Speaker 4:  like I, I mean, Monica, this was the point you made, right at the top of

743
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:12,020
Speaker 4:  your review, I could run thousands of Google docs on this all day long and

744
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:15,890
Speaker 4:  never hit the ceiling of it. Right. So like, I, I think that

745
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:19,760
Speaker 4:  the, the, the ultra consumer or the ultra purchaser is very

746
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,540
Speaker 4:  distinct and like knows what they want and what they need out of it. And

747
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:26,900
Speaker 4:  then like, if you just want like a killer desktop computer

748
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:31,340
Speaker 4:  just by the max and load up on storage and Ram and save that $2,000

749
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,900
Speaker 4:  for those other things that you're gonna need to pay for.

750
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:35,450
Speaker 9:  Yeah. The other thing about longevity that it is worth, you know, is going

751
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:37,370
Speaker 9:  to matter. It's not going to, to some people is going to matter a lot to

752
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:41,360
Speaker 9:  other people is that it's not modular. Like the Mac pro was,

753
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,730
Speaker 9:  so you aren't going to be upgrading the Ram or the storage,

754
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,650
Speaker 4:  But you could plug a display into it.

755
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,500
Speaker 1:  Any keyboard you want

756
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,540
Speaker 3:  There is that that's, that's like, they've still got to announce the Mac

757
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:57,260
Speaker 3:  pro they've still got to show that off. So I guess we're not going to have

758
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:00,260
Speaker 3:  to listen to more talk about the alter when it comes out and they're just

759
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,810
Speaker 3:  going to be like, yeah, it's got that. But also

760
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:05,810
Speaker 3:  modularity, like, is that the plan?

761
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:07,700
Speaker 1:  That means they're gonna have to figure out like PCI,

762
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:11,870
Speaker 4:  Just how does PCI extension work in the M one world is going to be a fascinating

763
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:12,380
Speaker 4:  thing to see?

764
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,560
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I don't know the answer to that question. I also, I think that's, what's

765
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:19,070
Speaker 1:  left for the Mac pro though. I mean, they were very clear. There's no more

766
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:21,110
Speaker 1:  chips, but there's a Mac pro coming

767
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:24,740
Speaker 4:  Well, there's wheels there's you can't get wheels for the studio.

768
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:28,460
Speaker 1:  Well, so they've got to do internal expansion. They might move that to M

769
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:32,330
Speaker 1:  to N they were clear. There's no more M one chips coming.

770
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:36,650
Speaker 1:  Or, and this is my, this is my idea. They could go back to wacky

771
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,240
Speaker 1:  GPU ideas in the Mac pro

772
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,250
Speaker 9:  Just start stacking ultras on top of each other. And Evelyn gets out,

773
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:47,660
Speaker 4:  What did they sold? And one ultras on a PCI card that

774
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:51,290
Speaker 4:  you could click in. So you could just keep running more and more and one

775
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,330
Speaker 4:  ultras and like more and more GPU code.

776
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:57,260
Speaker 1:  No, no, you think I'm crazy, but this is what I'm suggesting that

777
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,920
Speaker 1:  they're going to do, like wacky afterburner card setups,

778
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:05,180
Speaker 1:  where they sell a physical piece of hardware that effectively accelerates

779
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:08,810
Speaker 1:  one program, which is what the afterburner card does for final cut

780
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:12,320
Speaker 1:  pro there's all kinds of like, all that stuff remains wide open.

781
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,130
Speaker 3:  What if they let you update the storage and the ramp?

782
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,870
Speaker 3:  What if that's the Mac

783
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,410
Speaker 1:  You're never going to get the Ram because the Ram is unified memory architecture.

784
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:25,400
Speaker 1:  That is the bet. And then when we talk about the jump to apple,

785
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,820
Speaker 1:  Silicon, like some huge

786
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,910
Speaker 1:  undefined acceleration for all these pro apps is

787
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:36,540
Speaker 1:  that the video cards have access to just heaps of Ram.

788
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,890
Speaker 1:  And the CPU is have access to Ram fast enough to run a video card.

789
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,210
Speaker 1:  Right. Which is like an inversion of how things, th they're each

790
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:48,150
Speaker 1:  getting the thing the other kind of system used to have, but it's just one

791
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:52,020
Speaker 1:  huge pool of memory. And like, I know we, you know, we had our apple

792
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:55,320
Speaker 1:  briefing and I was like, okay, like on the Mac book air with eight gigs of

793
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,860
Speaker 1:  Ram people run out of memory, what happens on Alex Castro is like, I need

794
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:02,280
Speaker 1:  to justify this ultra, like here's

795
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,580
Speaker 1:  129 gigabyte file. And then I think it will be interesting.

796
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:11,670
Speaker 1:  So it's like, I don't think that we've seen that like play out in

797
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:15,450
Speaker 1:  computing that Apple's big Uma bet. Obviously we've seen it play out on iPhones

798
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:19,050
Speaker 1:  and iPads because they have unified memory, but we haven't seen it play out

799
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,480
Speaker 1:  on these systems. And we certainly didn't see that play out in prem machines

800
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,540
Speaker 1:  that potentially needs to last for a long time. But Monica, this was the

801
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,780
Speaker 1:  con like when you were listing pros and cons, the cons is you buy it and

802
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,520
Speaker 1:  that's it like you get what you get.

803
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,090
Speaker 9:  Yeah. What you get that doesn't necessarily matter to everyone. But for some

804
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:35,340
Speaker 9:  people in this crowd, it certainly is going to matter, especially with, to

805
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:39,060
Speaker 9:  your point. This thing is so expensive. You people are going to buy it, wanting

806
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:43,020
Speaker 9:  to last, wanting it to last for a long time. And I think that is, you know,

807
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:46,020
Speaker 9:  it's always the story with apple. Like you can upgrade apple stuff, but as

808
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,990
Speaker 9:  you're getting into this price range in this market, I do think that is something

809
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:49,500
Speaker 9:  to consider.

810
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,560
Speaker 1:  I would not buy this on one max with 32 gigs of Ram.

811
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:54,150
Speaker 3:  I immediately bought it.

812
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:56,640
Speaker 1:  Did you realize

813
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,660
Speaker 9:  You kinds of people?

814
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:01,580
Speaker 3:  I bought it like they hadn't even finished the, the, the,

815
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:05,460
Speaker 3:  the, the keynote. And I was like, refreshing the thing. Cause I'm on a

816
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:09,420
Speaker 3:  2016 MacBook pro that when I do a zoom call, I

817
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:11,640
Speaker 3:  can't open a spreadsheet. So like,

818
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,780
Speaker 4:  I think 32 gigabytes of Ram, it's going to be like perfectly

819
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:19,710
Speaker 4:  adequate for someone who is like, my budget is $2,000 for a desktop. That's

820
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,290
Speaker 4:  going to last five plus years. I think it's totally going to be perfectly

821
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:26,280
Speaker 4:  adequate. If you're going to be running the premiere pros and whatnot,

822
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,000
Speaker 4:  then like, maybe you want to upgrade that Ram, but it's not an inexpensive

823
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,840
Speaker 4:  upgrade. It's what four, $800 to go to 64 gigs. It's

824
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,320
Speaker 4:  huge.

825
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:38,280
Speaker 3:  Apple is so excited because for years, the

826
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,090
Speaker 3:  horrible thing about buying a computer from apple

827
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:46,170
Speaker 3:  was the Ram markup. And now you cannot escape it

828
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:48,540
Speaker 3:  like before you could be like, okay, I'll buy it. And then I'll go upgrade

829
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:51,720
Speaker 3:  by Ram for a reasonable price. And now it's like, Nope, I guess I'm going

830
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,530
Speaker 3:  to pay $200 for 24 gigabytes, more Ram or whatever.

831
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:57,660
Speaker 3:  So this is they're living the dream.

832
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,770
Speaker 1:  I just looked at this. And so I, when I bought my 16 inch MacBook pro I bought

833
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:05,310
Speaker 1:  the MUN pro because I was like, battery life is all I really care about.

834
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:08,670
Speaker 1:  And we, in our testing, we discovered the max had lower battery life. And

835
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:12,300
Speaker 1:  I realized that I, I thought I had like bought 64 grand, but I bought 32.

836
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,300
Speaker 1:  So I don't even know what I'm talking about. My own computer. I bought my

837
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:15,690
Speaker 1:  own money.

838
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:20,010
Speaker 3:  I'm just going to be like out of, out of capacity. And about a

839
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:23,820
Speaker 3:  year DLI, we're all going to be crying. They're 32 gigabytes of Ram.

840
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:28,230
Speaker 1:  Well, I just think for consumer use, right? And like, I would say that

841
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:32,200
Speaker 1:  I'm a professional user of Google docs. Like I'm a pro slack user,

842
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:32,500
Speaker 1:  but

843
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:38,260
Speaker 9:  If they ever make a Google docs specific Mack, I

844
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,450
Speaker 9:  will, I'm going to have a great time with that review.

845
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:44,740
Speaker 1:  And they're like, our world-class chip team has added

846
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:48,760
Speaker 4:  We're joking, but I have a browser window open right now that has eight Google

847
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,800
Speaker 4:  docs open in it right now. And that's just for,

848
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:54,460
Speaker 1:  That's fine. If they make one, if they're like, we've added a

849
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,700
Speaker 1:  dedicated 12 core processor for

850
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:01,360
Speaker 1:  accelerates Chrome. And like I'm buying that computer.

851
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:04,240
Speaker 9:  I will be like Alex and I will be ordering it on my phone before the keynote

852
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,290
Speaker 9:  is over keynote, over

853
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,160
Speaker 4:  There's someone we know that might, you know, work on a certain product line

854
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:13,300
Speaker 4:  and a certain company that we could pitch a Google

855
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,800
Speaker 4:  doc specific hardware to.

856
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:20,350
Speaker 9:  And it'll be like the back next to you. And I'll just have all you guys lined

857
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:23,890
Speaker 9:  up to interview one by one and bet your Google docs experience and how much

858
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:24,670
Speaker 9:  faster it was in your,

859
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:31,030
Speaker 1:  I get a 20 minute video. They're just moving. Like, so here's my Google,

860
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:32,200
Speaker 1:  the hugs experience

861
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,730
Speaker 9:  Tabbing through. I don't really like to open file and recent. And you know,

862
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:38,050
Speaker 9:  that's a lot slower on this machine

863
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:40,810
Speaker 1:  And that would be just 20 minutes with me bitching. About every time I started

864
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:44,410
Speaker 1:  a new Google doc, it goes to my personal Gmail account. And not my, not my

865
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:47,530
Speaker 1:  work one, all I'm saying is this, you America texture. Like we still don't

866
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:49,990
Speaker 1:  know it's going to play out in desktop computing. And I would just always

867
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:53,620
Speaker 1:  buy the most Ram. I think that's been the rule for 20

868
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:57,220
Speaker 1:  years that buying more memory for your computer as a,

869
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:59,740
Speaker 1:  almost a more useful upgrade than the processor itself.

870
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:03,670
Speaker 4:  Sure. But to Alex's point that could have been done at any point that you

871
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:07,540
Speaker 4:  owned the computer and now it's like, okay, well I'm shelling out two grand

872
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:11,470
Speaker 4:  for the base model of this computer. Five 12 gigabyte is actually a

873
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:15,190
Speaker 4:  bigger concern. I have then 32 gigs of Ram. Like I would

874
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:16,750
Speaker 4:  fill that up with media.

875
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,370
Speaker 9:  That is not enough. Yeah. So

876
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:21,280
Speaker 4:  I, you, you need, you probably want to upgrade the storage,

877
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,090
Speaker 1:  But you can buy more storage. This isn't a ports galore,

878
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,670
Speaker 1:  man. Just stick an SD card in the front. I get

879
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:29,590
Speaker 4:  It. But like, who wants to do that

880
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:33,040
Speaker 1:  Right now? Every Mac accessory maker in the world is like, here's what we're

881
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,260
Speaker 1:  going to do. We're going to make a little wedge of a hard drive and we're

882
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,540
Speaker 1:  gonna put it right under the top. And instead of more ports on it, but

883
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,640
Speaker 9:  That takes up a port that you could be using for

884
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:40,960
Speaker 4:  More than other display.

885
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:42,220
Speaker 1:  We'll add more.

886
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,760
Speaker 9:  If I want to connect five displays to this thing and just have them on the

887
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,190
Speaker 9:  wall. I can't, I got every port counts.

888
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:52,810
Speaker 1:  Monica. One thing that did not pan out is apple

889
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:56,440
Speaker 1:  compared to the ultra to the 30, 90 on a series of

890
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,660
Speaker 1:  charts. I don't know why

891
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:02,980
Speaker 9:  They had like relative performance on the Y axis. You know, that very

892
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:04,690
Speaker 9:  useful word that we all know what that means. Okay.

893
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,090
Speaker 1:  Yeah, we definitely, and they would definitely tell us which benchmarks they

894
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:10,390
Speaker 1:  were running, which they refused to do, but you didn't find that to be the

895
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:11,680
Speaker 1:  case at all, that it could run with the,

896
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,880
Speaker 9:  No, I could not, did not replicate that in the GP benchmarks, we ran our

897
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,870
Speaker 9:  editor TC has a three 90 at home. He ran a geek

898
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:23,560
Speaker 9:  bench compute for us. It just absolutely demolished

899
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:27,620
Speaker 9:  the MRL tra like, and what ultra didn't even get like half of its

900
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:31,520
Speaker 9:  score. There have been some like back in like October,

901
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:35,630
Speaker 9:  there were some issues with geek bench in apple, but geek bench has had like

902
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:39,590
Speaker 9:  a lot of time to fix that issue. And also these were not like cookie scores

903
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:43,520
Speaker 9:  that I would not expect to get. Like this is like, I think it's just a

904
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,060
Speaker 9:  lot worse.

905
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:48,380
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So Haim and I looked now that we have our

906
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:52,760
Speaker 1:  results from benchmarks, the 30 nineties, like twice as powerful and various

907
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,660
Speaker 1:  benchmarks as the ultra, depending on the benchmark,

908
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:00,380
Speaker 1:  depending on the test. And so Haim and I went back and looked at those weird

909
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:03,860
Speaker 1:  apple graphs. Okay. So the Y axis is relative

910
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:07,340
Speaker 1:  performance and the X axis has power in Watts.

911
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:12,140
Speaker 1:  So the Y axis already is like just confusing. And maybe they're

912
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:16,070
Speaker 1:  just re you know, they're, they're just moving other numbers. Like

913
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:19,910
Speaker 1:  they're just turning each geek bench scores into zero to 100, like, I don't

914
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:20,720
Speaker 1:  know what they're doing. It's just,

915
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,660
Speaker 9:  It makes total sense to do in charts, you know, just move, move numbers around.

916
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:27,740
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Just convert them into a different set of units for no reason. But

917
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:30,980
Speaker 1:  here's the thing. The 30, 90 line on that chart

918
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:35,120
Speaker 1:  stops at 320 Watts. And the

919
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:39,020
Speaker 1:  30 90 has a standard TDP

920
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:42,410
Speaker 1:  of 350 Watts and can spike to 400.

921
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,000
Speaker 1:  So they just stopped the line in 320 months.

922
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:52,220
Speaker 1:  And we're like, oh, that's why like, there's just more line.

923
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:58,760
Speaker 1:  That's the graph. Like the relative performance,

924
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:03,020
Speaker 1:  Y axis goes up to 200, but the 30 90 line

925
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:06,710
Speaker 1:  can go to 400. If you just keep letting it

926
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:07,310
Speaker 1:  go.

927
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:08,990
Speaker 9:  How utterly useful

928
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:13,130
Speaker 1:  I have complained about these charts so much. They, I mean, apple is

929
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,590
Speaker 1:  deeply aware of how I feel about the chart.

930
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:19,760
Speaker 9:  This is not going to shock anyone also, but the gaming, the frame rates

931
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,690
Speaker 9:  we were seeing in games were not at all close. So we always offered a 30,

932
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:24,230
Speaker 9:  90 either.

933
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:28,460
Speaker 1:  Can you talk about this? A lot of our comments were about shadow the tomb

934
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:31,310
Speaker 1:  Raider, which is not optimized for apple Silicon, but it's like the only

935
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:34,610
Speaker 1:  benchmark that we have across multiple systems.

936
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,270
Speaker 9:  It is a standard benchmark that everyone runs into the very GPU heavy

937
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:41,900
Speaker 9:  game. It has been out for, you know, quite a few years

938
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:45,350
Speaker 9:  now. Like it's not like it's this brand new game that, you know,

939
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:49,310
Speaker 9:  apple hasn't figured how to run. I mean, it is a game that like a graphically

940
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:52,610
Speaker 9:  powerful computer we would expect it would be able to run.

941
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,390
Speaker 3:  It's one of the first games with Ray tracing. Like it was one of the first

942
00:52:56,390 --> 00:53:00,080
Speaker 3:  things we used for, for benchmarking, for Ray tracing, like shadow

943
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:03,980
Speaker 3:  shadow of the tomb. Raider is a very good benchmark

944
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:07,790
Speaker 3:  process product. And it's like, it's like that. And

945
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:11,480
Speaker 3:  civilization that's, which if you're going to benchmark across apple

946
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,480
Speaker 3:  and windows, that's kind of it because

947
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:19,070
Speaker 3:  apple does not care about gaming will never care about gaming. I'm sorry.

948
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:22,790
Speaker 3:  I'm sorry. But they just don't care. And they're never going to care

949
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:26,550
Speaker 3:  about, you know, trends, excuse me, PC gaming. They're never gonna care about

950
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:29,760
Speaker 3:  transferring PC gaming. They're never going to, and, and those companies

951
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,570
Speaker 3:  are never going to modify their software to make it run better on

952
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,270
Speaker 3:  an M one. I mean, they might,

953
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,830
Speaker 1:  If apple was smart, they would go and they would pay the developer of shadow

954
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:41,430
Speaker 1:  tomb, Raider to optimize it for apple Silicon, just to end this

955
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:45,420
Speaker 3:  Just, yeah, just, just, and in this, like, and it's also funny that they

956
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:49,200
Speaker 3:  compared it to 30 90, when Macko S can't

957
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,070
Speaker 3:  even really use Nvidia GPU's anymore. Like they

958
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:55,380
Speaker 3:  got rid of Kuda support years ago. Yeah,

959
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,020
Speaker 1:  That's true. But like, that's what they're comparing is because that's the

960
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:01,770
Speaker 1:  best one on the PC side. I understand. Here's the, here's the thing I

961
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:05,520
Speaker 1:  understand where they are compared to 30, 90, all they're saying is for

962
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:09,510
Speaker 1:  200 Watts, less power, we can like run with the big

963
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:11,380
Speaker 1:  dogs. Right? That's what they're trying to say.

964
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,250
Speaker 9:  So this, and last year when they compare it to the 30 80, and that also turned

965
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:17,370
Speaker 9:  out to be not really necessarily a true,

966
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:22,080
Speaker 1:  I could. Why walk into that fight? The thing

967
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:25,860
Speaker 1:  is historic. And the thing is that massive victory in ship

968
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:28,860
Speaker 1:  design, the performance is out of control. People love it. And you're like,

969
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:32,970
Speaker 1:  here's this graph that's going to make you mad at us and then not be

970
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:34,560
Speaker 1:  true. Like, what are you doing?

971
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,180
Speaker 9:  And just to be, to clarify on what was the frame rates we were getting from

972
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:43,170
Speaker 9:  the ultra, we're still like, you know, well, above 60. So it's

973
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:46,890
Speaker 9:  not like, like this couldn't run the game. Like the frame rates were clearly

974
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:50,640
Speaker 9:  good. The issue is that there's still stutter

975
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:54,420
Speaker 9:  going on in the game. Like it was still like, even when it was running, like

976
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:57,780
Speaker 9:  over a hundred frames per second, like the wrist, it was still hiccupping

977
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:00,660
Speaker 9:  all the time, which I think just goes to show like, you know, this is not

978
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:03,360
Speaker 9:  a gaming PC. No, one's gonna buy it for games. We understand that like games

979
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:07,140
Speaker 9:  aren't optimized for it. We understand that. But you know, in terms of comparing

980
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:10,800
Speaker 9:  graphics power to the graphics power that other machines have,

981
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:12,900
Speaker 9:  like, that's a number we get, we're gonna use.

982
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:17,010
Speaker 1:  If you can find us a game that runs an apple, Silicon and

983
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:20,790
Speaker 1:  windows that is graphically intensive, that has a built-in benchmark.

984
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:23,010
Speaker 9:  Don't say like world of Warcraft. Cause I'm not going to,

985
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,070
Speaker 9:  sorry. I'm not doing

986
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:31,080
Speaker 1:  I, if you can find us that test, we'll run it. But this is what we got, I

987
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:34,560
Speaker 1:  think is basically the answer. So I just want to start, I'm going to start

988
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,330
Speaker 1:  at the high before he go to the low that's what I was trying to deepen. It

989
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:41,160
Speaker 1:  was like, we're going to build up his historic computer

990
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:46,290
Speaker 1:  deeply disappointing display. I don't know what's

991
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:49,890
Speaker 1:  going on with this display. So apple announced the Mac studio. They announced

992
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:53,340
Speaker 1:  the studio display the cancel the 27 inch iMac.

993
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:56,880
Speaker 1:  Everyone is like, okay, here's what they're doing. They're reselling this

994
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,300
Speaker 1:  way from the 27 inch iMac, which is the only 5k display apart from

995
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:04,770
Speaker 1:  the, I would say much hated LG ultra-fine 5k. People do not

996
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:08,400
Speaker 1:  like that display. So here it is. It's in a case you can plug it into this

997
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,390
Speaker 1:  thing or place sort of the iMac profile. There is, I would say

998
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:15,630
Speaker 1:  just an inordinate amount of chatter about whether apple will do another

999
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:18,870
Speaker 1:  iMac pro or another 20 S I don't know what's going to happen. These are the

1000
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:22,380
Speaker 1:  computers as cell now. So we get the display apples, like the

1001
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:25,540
Speaker 1:  displays 5k display. It's beautiful. They don't make a lot of claims about

1002
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:28,390
Speaker 1:  the display itself for reasons that we'll get into in a moment, but they

1003
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:31,930
Speaker 1:  make a huge claim about it's video conferencing

1004
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:35,440
Speaker 1:  capability, right? It's got a three mic array. It's got six

1005
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,400
Speaker 1:  speakers. It's got a 12 megapixel camera. That

1006
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,650
Speaker 1:  is the same camera as the iPad

1007
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:43,780
Speaker 3:  Camera Nila.

1008
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:47,290
Speaker 1:  And that's kind of a 13 chip, which is the same chip as the iPhone 11. We

1009
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:50,860
Speaker 1:  were just talking about that. I was like, this is the, this is the phone

1010
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:54,850
Speaker 1:  that made me stop using my RX 100. So I'm expecting to be blown away.

1011
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:58,510
Speaker 1:  And I will say, this is probably not fair to apple. It's not fair to the

1012
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:02,230
Speaker 1:  Opal team. But what I was expecting was we there's that start-up

1013
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:06,160
Speaker 1:  Opal, that cameras are either camera. That's a $400 standalone camera.

1014
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:10,450
Speaker 1:  It's called the Opal C1. It is the same camera

1015
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:14,110
Speaker 1:  module is the original pixel and a little Intel chip

1016
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:17,980
Speaker 1:  that does computational photography in the webcam is great, which is

1017
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:21,150
Speaker 1:  great. I bought one for our CEO, cause I was like, you gotta stop doing all

1018
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:25,000
Speaker 1:  hands on this whole company on your Mac book air. Right? So the thing's

1019
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,870
Speaker 1:  great. So I'm expecting that apple is going to do computational photography

1020
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:32,350
Speaker 1:  at smartphone level On this display.

1021
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:33,670
Speaker 3:  Did you get that thing

1022
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:35,260
Speaker 1:  Is garbage. Like

1023
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:37,420
Speaker 9:  It's so, so bad.

1024
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:38,980
Speaker 1:  I mean, it's so bad.

1025
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,680
Speaker 9:  It's really ridiculous to look at

1026
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:46,750
Speaker 1:  It's I don't know what's wrong with it. I honestly can't tell you. It's a

1027
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:49,420
Speaker 1:  12 megapixel sensor and an a series processor

1028
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:53,980
Speaker 1:  five years, a half a decade of experience will

1029
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:57,400
Speaker 1:  tell you that apple is good at those two components, making good photos

1030
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:01,870
Speaker 1:  in a series processor that's Apple's stuff. They know how to

1031
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:04,810
Speaker 1:  do anything. It's like put those together and make photos that are better

1032
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:07,990
Speaker 1:  than any Android phone. And the thing is garbage.

1033
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:12,310
Speaker 3:  I have a theory. Yeah. I've got a theory. It's a really bad theory.

1034
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:15,820
Speaker 3:  So I was looking, I was looking at, you know, the lovely video, everybody,

1035
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:18,850
Speaker 3:  please go watch it. There's a really great comparison shot. And it's Neil

1036
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:22,240
Speaker 3:  and like four different cameras at once. There are no

1037
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:26,170
Speaker 3:  shadows, right? Like contrast does not exist on this thing. I think they

1038
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:29,920
Speaker 3:  used cardboard cutouts of people for all of their testing.

1039
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:34,210
Speaker 3:  So they never had to actually like mimic real world,

1040
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:37,150
Speaker 3:  like contrast in what people actually see.

1041
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:41,830
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I don't know, man. We took briefings, you know, and

1042
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:44,770
Speaker 1:  they were saying they were on these cameras and the briefings. It did not

1043
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:47,830
Speaker 1:  look this bad. I got home. I plugged the thing in, I plugged it into the

1044
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:51,580
Speaker 1:  Mac studio that I had. I plugged it into my Mac book. Pro Monica had

1045
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:55,330
Speaker 1:  one, she plugged into one like, woo. It just looks

1046
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:58,720
Speaker 1:  bad. Like Joanna stern compared it to her Blackberry

1047
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,160
Speaker 1:  10 years ago,

1048
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:04,540
Speaker 4:  It does some weird stuff too. Right? So like part of the pitch is that it

1049
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:08,620
Speaker 4:  supports center stage, which is the auto framing type of feature that

1050
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:12,610
Speaker 4:  they debuted on the iPads already. And it's kind of whack when

1051
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:15,190
Speaker 4:  it does that, which is, it's kind of a weird thing to put on a monitor where

1052
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:19,090
Speaker 4:  you're sitting still anyways, but it has that feature. It's got portrait

1053
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:22,490
Speaker 4:  mode with an M one computer. So if you've got a Mac studio or you got an

1054
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:26,180
Speaker 4:  M one Mac book, you can do portrait mode on there. But like it's a

1055
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:30,170
Speaker 4:  12 megapixel camera, which has a very wide field of view from

1056
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:34,100
Speaker 4:  12 megapixels. You can pull a 4k video feed out of because that's enough

1057
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:37,670
Speaker 4:  resolution for 4k, but this camera never gives you the

1058
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:41,600
Speaker 4:  full 4k. If you turn off center stage it like,

1059
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:45,620
Speaker 4:  it's a very cropped in view of that field of view.

1060
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:49,280
Speaker 4:  And it's still 10 ADP. It's very low quality. It's very strange.

1061
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:53,120
Speaker 3:  You think they cheaped out on the Ram and

1062
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,800
Speaker 1:  In the studio display

1063
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,210
Speaker 4:  And they didn't get the upgrade when they were buying. And then I got, should've

1064
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:00,500
Speaker 4:  gotten a 64.

1065
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:03,200
Speaker 1:  Oh, well, let me just finish this. And then we can, we can, I don't know,

1066
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:07,010
Speaker 1:  what's wrong with this thing. So all week I am sending basically

1067
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:10,820
Speaker 1:  selfies of myself in various lighting conditions to apple, which is a

1068
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:14,780
Speaker 1:  weird thing to do. I'm like, here I am in my basement again, like, Hey, like

1069
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:18,740
Speaker 1:  here I am in the office, like comparing it. You know, we, we

1070
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,200
Speaker 1:  got, there's some friends of the verge out there who review products. So

1071
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,160
Speaker 1:  like some, a little back channel opens up. Then we're also like this crazy,

1072
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:28,760
Speaker 1:  again, more selfies of myself sent to more people this past week than I've

1073
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:29,950
Speaker 1:  ever been comfortable living.

1074
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:34,610
Speaker 1:  And Apple's like, we're looking into it. You know, it's all very sincere.

1075
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:38,510
Speaker 1:  I ran a full SIS diagnose. Actually Monica ran it for me. We sent that

1076
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:41,480
Speaker 1:  over because I didn't have the machine anymore because I was back home and

1077
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:44,930
Speaker 1:  it was in the office. But we sent that to apple. We checked all the

1078
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:48,830
Speaker 1:  firmwares. We updated the soft it's all the same. So finally

1079
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:52,670
Speaker 1:  last night apple says, and Dan and I were joking. Like I could have written

1080
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:54,770
Speaker 1:  this line the first day

1081
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,810
Speaker 9:  And just pre recorded in the video. Yeah.

1082
01:00:56,810 --> 01:01:00,530
Speaker 1:  Like I didn't need to wait until the last minute. Like, we've seen the

1083
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:03,500
Speaker 1:  thing. It's not behaving as we expected a future software update. We'll fix

1084
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:07,220
Speaker 1:  it. Okay. Sure. I w I don't know, like maybe it

1085
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:11,210
Speaker 1:  will the rule, and this has been our rule from the

1086
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:14,090
Speaker 1:  beginning of the verge, dating back to art and gadget days, like whatever

1087
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:17,690
Speaker 1:  is, we've been burned too many times where people promise you a software

1088
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:20,840
Speaker 1:  updates and you review what's in the box because you can never count on the

1089
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,180
Speaker 1:  software update coming, and you never know what it's actually going to fix.

1090
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:27,560
Speaker 1:  So I asked, when is it coming? What will it fix no answers. So I don't

1091
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,290
Speaker 1:  know if they can fix it. I don't know if they, they should fix it. Now that

1092
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:33,770
Speaker 1:  the reviews are out. There's like noise in the world that this is a last

1093
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:37,670
Speaker 1:  minute bug. And actually isn't, who knows? I don't know. But the thing looks

1094
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:40,970
Speaker 1:  like a potato. Like, that's, that's what I got for you.

1095
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:46,070
Speaker 9:  Biggest impression was that I would take a lot of, I was like hanging out

1096
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:49,760
Speaker 9:  with the person who made our video Becca this entire week. And we would

1097
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,920
Speaker 9:  often be taking these meetings together. When we were talking about this

1098
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,380
Speaker 9:  review, it would be like me and Becca trying to get in the frame and center

1099
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:58,190
Speaker 9:  stage would just lose its mind. Like it could not figure out what to focus

1100
01:01:58,190 --> 01:02:01,540
Speaker 9:  on. It was like swooping back and forth, like, like, like a

1101
01:02:01,970 --> 01:02:05,630
Speaker 9:  remote, like VR amusement park rides. Like it just like, it

1102
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:08,330
Speaker 9:  could not figure out where everyone was telling us, turn it off, because

1103
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:11,030
Speaker 9:  it was so distracting, like that kept going in and out.

1104
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:14,120
Speaker 1:  So it keeps them moving around. I was trying to record my little update last

1105
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:17,810
Speaker 1:  night with center stage on. And I was like, I can't like, this is just not

1106
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:21,720
Speaker 1:  working. Like, it's just like flying the room anyway.

1107
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:24,540
Speaker 1:  So we were not the only people who ran into problems. The camera at Joanna

1108
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:28,350
Speaker 1:  ran into these problems, got the same statement. Sean Gruber ran into these

1109
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:31,080
Speaker 1:  problems, got the same statement. He actually called it the center stage

1110
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:34,080
Speaker 1:  stuff. I was so distracted by how bad the camera was. I was like, I can't

1111
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:37,410
Speaker 1:  even, I can't even think about anything else. Like I'm not looking at your

1112
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:40,980
Speaker 1:  center stage right now. I will say the microphone is great.

1113
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:45,390
Speaker 1:  It is like really good. The speakers, I don't know if two

1114
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:49,200
Speaker 1:  speakers and a stereo pair that are like 18 inches apart can produce spacial

1115
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:53,130
Speaker 1:  audio. I don't even know spatial. Audio is like a real

1116
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:55,110
Speaker 1:  thing that is worth it.

1117
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,680
Speaker 3:  That is a lot of what's happening right now on this podcast.

1118
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:04,380
Speaker 1:  Did I try to have the experience of Jimmy page sneaking up behind me with

1119
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:08,130
Speaker 1:  a guitar with this computer? Like yes. Did it have, like,

1120
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:12,600
Speaker 1:  it was, I surprised I was with this speakers do sound

1121
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:16,170
Speaker 1:  good. I just, you know how I feel about audio processing and then the display

1122
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:19,710
Speaker 1:  itself is just like, this panel is from 2014, man.

1123
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:21,750
Speaker 3:  It is impeccably calibrated.

1124
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:25,650
Speaker 1:  It is impeccably. Calibrated is very bright. Dan's theory,

1125
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:29,640
Speaker 1:  about 600 nits versus 500 nits is it's in a different case and it has fans

1126
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:32,130
Speaker 1:  so they can run the backlight LEDs brighter. Right.

1127
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:35,970
Speaker 4:  It doesn't have a whole computer in there soaking up making heat so they

1128
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:37,360
Speaker 4:  could that's that's my theory, at least.

1129
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,740
Speaker 1:  Right. But in your day-to-day use, are you running this thing into full 600?

1130
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:44,250
Speaker 1:  And it's like, like maybe like, are you going to see it? Like, I don't know,

1131
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:48,930
Speaker 1:  but then it's just a single led backlight. And I went and I was like,

1132
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:52,890
Speaker 1:  just like looking around. I was like $3,379 TVs

1133
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:54,660
Speaker 1:  with full array, local dimming. Now

1134
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:58,290
Speaker 3:  You guys all took offense at this, but I actually kind of like it.

1135
01:03:58,650 --> 01:04:01,740
Speaker 3:  And that's because I want to, all of this is dumb reason. I said the reason

1136
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:01,920
Speaker 3:  I know,

1137
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:05,550
Speaker 4:  So Alex is coming out as a dark, dark grays

1138
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:06,390
Speaker 4:  enthusiast.

1139
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,210
Speaker 3:  I am, I love my dark grays.

1140
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:14,580
Speaker 3:  I love my all ed. I adore my OLED. The thing I

1141
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:18,480
Speaker 3:  cannot stand about 99% of back led TVs is they

1142
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:22,410
Speaker 3:  cannot mimic like, even really good tons of, yeah. The

1143
01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:26,370
Speaker 3:  bloom, the bloom just distracts me, irritates me. And so I would rather

1144
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:30,310
Speaker 3:  have screen wide bloom where I don't have to think about it.

1145
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:33,380
Speaker 3:  The bloom and little spots

1146
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:35,550
Speaker 9:  Everything's blooming. So you just get used to it.

1147
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,180
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Like that for me, I was like, you know what? I don't hate

1148
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:42,960
Speaker 3:  that. But also I watch like, I'd be using it in a big

1149
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:47,010
Speaker 3:  room anyway, with a lot of tea, with a lot of light. So it's not

1150
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:50,760
Speaker 3:  going to hit me as hard as somebody who's like sitting in the darkness,

1151
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,290
Speaker 3:  trying to use this thing. It will suck.

1152
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:56,040
Speaker 9:  Like I will say I've never seen two displays look more different than seeing

1153
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:59,760
Speaker 9:  the XDR next to this one, the pro display XTR next? This one in like a

1154
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,690
Speaker 9:  dark, our dark office. Like, it was just, it was like,

1155
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:07,200
Speaker 9:  basically like literally night and day. Like there was one like very bright,

1156
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,090
Speaker 9:  dark gray, and one that is actually black.

1157
01:05:09,930 --> 01:05:13,680
Speaker 3:  I do think the thing that provided the most irritation from when I,

1158
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:16,530
Speaker 3:  because I went and looked at it with, with Monica, I brought in all my really

1159
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:20,110
Speaker 3:  stupid little nerdy patterns. And I was like, let's talk to patterns.

1160
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:23,650
Speaker 3:  And Monica was like, it was fast. I said, it just like that. Monica was like

1161
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,930
Speaker 3:  very, very polite and was like, sure.

1162
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:33,190
Speaker 3:  But, but before that, Monica had to like wipe the entire thing

1163
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:36,910
Speaker 3:  down repeatedly because you had the, the nano texture, right?

1164
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:41,010
Speaker 9:  Every two seconds, we had to wipe it down because you, your,

1165
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:44,710
Speaker 9:  your hand comes within like 10 feet of this thing. And it gets a fingerprint

1166
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:45,040
Speaker 9:  on it.

1167
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:48,070
Speaker 3:  Magnet for handle ELLs,

1168
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:52,030
Speaker 9:  Which we sort of, you know, that obviously was a problem for us because we

1169
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:54,400
Speaker 9:  were carrying a sing around everywhere. I don't know how much of a problem

1170
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,100
Speaker 9:  that is for like the average person. Just go to like, have it on a desk.

1171
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:59,260
Speaker 9:  Like, I don't know how often they're going to be touching their display,

1172
01:05:59,290 --> 01:05:59,590
Speaker 9:  but

1173
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:01,810
Speaker 1:  When they're going to move, they're going to adjust the, if

1174
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:04,480
Speaker 9:  You adjust the angle, you will have to probably have to wipe it. You

1175
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,650
Speaker 3:  Will need to wear gloves.

1176
01:06:05,770 --> 01:06:08,740
Speaker 1:  I'm Alex here, weird ideas went backwards side.

1177
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:14,500
Speaker 1:  I kind of by the orient, like blooming and LCD TV is bad. Like

1178
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:18,730
Speaker 1:  this is what great IPS LCD has looked like

1179
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:23,200
Speaker 1:  since 2014. I mean, they started shipping. I'm

1180
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:26,110
Speaker 1:  looking at a 2015 iMac right now with the same panel in it.

1181
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:31,120
Speaker 1:  It is exactly the same. Right? You can get the QT or led that cam on.

1182
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,050
Speaker 1:  It has on his desk.

1183
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:35,650
Speaker 3:  It's in the, it was in the office. And I went and looked at it, stunning,

1184
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,480
Speaker 3:  gorgeous. I cannot wait to read the review.

1185
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:38,530
Speaker 4:  Excellent.

1186
01:06:39,310 --> 01:06:41,080
Speaker 1:  But cheaper than this thing,

1187
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:46,420
Speaker 1:  you can save the money and you can buy a webcam that doesn't

1188
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:48,310
Speaker 1:  insult your friends and colleagues.

1189
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,360
Speaker 3:  I spend for like, okay, it's $1,300,

1190
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:56,170
Speaker 3:  $1,600. So for a hundred dollars more

1191
01:06:57,030 --> 01:06:58,510
Speaker 1:  To get a better display,

1192
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:03,550
Speaker 3:  I don't know. It's more, you get the QD OLED and you get the Opal.

1193
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:07,450
Speaker 3:  And then you've got a good webcam and a really, really good

1194
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:10,990
Speaker 3:  display that you can probably presumably touch without needing

1195
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:11,560
Speaker 3:  gloves.

1196
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:15,460
Speaker 4:  I am going to be the, the reason to buy the apple

1197
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:19,330
Speaker 4:  display argument is because of its stupid 5k resolution though. But to

1198
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:23,180
Speaker 4:  like me last point, like you've had that since 2014, like, like the, like

1199
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,950
Speaker 4:  the person who wants the 5k display is not interested in the QD Allah, because

1200
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:30,940
Speaker 4:  it is a 1440 P panel that doesn't scale macro S nicely. And it doesn't have

1201
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:34,360
Speaker 4:  pixel perfect icons and all this other stuff, which is like a thing that

1202
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:38,140
Speaker 4:  a lot of creatives and developers care deeply

1203
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:40,930
Speaker 4:  about. They want that sharp resolution. If you're coding all day long, you're

1204
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:43,870
Speaker 4:  looking at little texts, sharp resolution matters a lot more than refresh

1205
01:07:43,870 --> 01:07:44,200
Speaker 4:  rates.

1206
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:48,490
Speaker 3:  Theoretically, everyone in this room should want the 5k because all we do

1207
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:49,480
Speaker 3:  is look at texts all day.

1208
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:53,440
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean, but, but unless you play games in the evening, like then, then

1209
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,470
Speaker 4:  you know, you want the refresh rates, right. And you want the contrast, or

1210
01:07:56,470 --> 01:08:00,310
Speaker 4:  if you're using your monitor to watch movies or whatever it is, then, then

1211
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:04,000
Speaker 4:  the QTL it'll be fantastic. But like, you could have

1212
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,900
Speaker 4:  gotten that experience for seven years now, or however long it's been. I

1213
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,880
Speaker 4:  don't know how to count. Is it eight years? Maybe it's eight years since

1214
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:13,420
Speaker 4:  2014 now. And we're not seeing any advancement on this end. Like it's a

1215
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:17,300
Speaker 4:  $1,600 display. I feel like we could excuse the fact that the

1216
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:21,440
Speaker 4:  panel was old. If it was $800, like, we'd be like, all right, whatever,

1217
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:24,200
Speaker 4:  that's the apple tax that you're paying and you get the speakers and the

1218
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:28,100
Speaker 4:  microphone and a terrible webcam, but it's is like $1,600. When I look at

1219
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:31,820
Speaker 4:  like $1,600 displays, I'm looking at 5k two K

1220
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:35,690
Speaker 4:  panels from LG that are ultra wide with, you know, DCI P

1221
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:39,680
Speaker 4:  three gamuts and everything like that, that are like 40 inches. That's

1222
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:43,460
Speaker 4:  a $1,600 display. Like they just kind of blow this

1223
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:46,430
Speaker 4:  away. When it comes to like an actual monitor experience,

1224
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,820
Speaker 3:  This is going to end up being like the home pod, the original home pod. So

1225
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:52,880
Speaker 3:  if we wait a year, it'll probably like half in price,

1226
01:08:53,150 --> 01:08:54,290
Speaker 9:  Put out a tiny one.

1227
01:08:56,810 --> 01:09:00,500
Speaker 13:  They will cancel this one. And they will put out a 15 inch USBC

1228
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:01,040
Speaker 13:  display,

1229
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:05,120
Speaker 9:  Hold it in your Palm. And like,

1230
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:09,770
Speaker 1:  Yeah. It's to me, it's you can't have HDR without local dimming.

1231
01:09:10,290 --> 01:09:14,150
Speaker 1:  If you just like played out in your head to do HDR, you need some parts of

1232
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:17,420
Speaker 1:  the screen that are way brighter than others. So you can't just ramp the

1233
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:21,410
Speaker 1:  whole backlight. You need to selectively light up parts of the display.

1234
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:25,310
Speaker 1:  So you can have HDR that local living. There's no clubbing save no HDR. Now

1235
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:28,160
Speaker 1:  this thing's just like out of the running. Like I do keep coming back to

1236
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:31,820
Speaker 1:  the fact that the cheapest TVs now have

1237
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:35,840
Speaker 1:  full array. Backlights full rate, local Demi backlights with HDR.

1238
01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:40,100
Speaker 1:  And maybe you could still use the panel, but why not innovate on

1239
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:43,640
Speaker 1:  the backlight, which is like a totally possible thing to do.

1240
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:46,100
Speaker 1:  And they did not do that

1241
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:49,940
Speaker 3:  For the same price you could go get for around the same price, a

1242
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:53,510
Speaker 3:  48 inch LG all led with

1243
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:57,080
Speaker 3:  120 Hertz refresh rate, the absolute best

1244
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:59,060
Speaker 3:  color. And,

1245
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:02,450
Speaker 1:  But you would only get that 4k resolution and you'd run it.

1246
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:05,780
Speaker 4:  And also it's a 48 inch screen on your desk. And I can tell you, that's not

1247
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:06,680
Speaker 4:  a fun time.

1248
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:08,900
Speaker 3:  Don't do it so much TV.

1249
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:13,160
Speaker 1:  I personally cannot really see refresh rates beyond 60 Hertz. This is

1250
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:15,830
Speaker 1:  actually like deep Dieter and he's to talk about all the time. Like he was

1251
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:18,080
Speaker 1:  really, he could see the refresh rates. I

1252
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:18,800
Speaker 9:  Absolutely can.

1253
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:22,430
Speaker 1:  And I see HDR in color. And like,

1254
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,940
Speaker 1:  I dunno, maybe that's just a thing like you're one or the other you're left-handed

1255
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:29,600
Speaker 1:  or right-handed. But to me, it's way more important to have the HTR in that.

1256
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:33,440
Speaker 1:  And the backlight then refresh rates. I know we have tons of people in our

1257
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,660
Speaker 1:  audience, Monica who can see it.

1258
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:39,710
Speaker 4:  It's a, it's a constant argument in, in our slack as to like, how could you

1259
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:43,340
Speaker 4:  buy a 60 Hertz monitor? I will say that like for a monitor where your inputs

1260
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:45,740
Speaker 4:  are detached, you've got your mouse, your keyboard, or your track pad or

1261
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:49,610
Speaker 4:  whatever. I do not see as big of a different, I'm looking at 120 Hertz monitor

1262
01:10:49,610 --> 01:10:53,420
Speaker 4:  right now. And I really only use it ever for work. And if I turn it to 60

1263
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:56,180
Speaker 4:  Hertz, I really don't notice much of a difference. You do notice a difference

1264
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:59,420
Speaker 4:  in gaming because everything's a little bit smoother there. And I definitely

1265
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:01,940
Speaker 4:  notice it on a lot of touchscreen devices. And we'll probably talk about

1266
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:05,540
Speaker 4:  this with the iPad, but if I'm directly manipulating things and I'm

1267
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:08,960
Speaker 4:  actually reading texts, as I'm scrolling it with my finger, I noticed that

1268
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:12,320
Speaker 4:  120 Hertz, because I can still read the text as I do it. Whereas a 60 Hertz

1269
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:15,480
Speaker 4:  screen will we'll blur it out or get choppy. So it really depends on your

1270
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:19,080
Speaker 4:  use cases, whether faster refresh rates make sense for your,

1271
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:22,950
Speaker 4:  your needs. But I think anybody could probably tell to your point in your

1272
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:26,790
Speaker 4:  life, the difference between an HDR and a non HDR screen, most

1273
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:28,200
Speaker 4:  likely, regardless of what you're doing.

1274
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:32,550
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I don't know, man. I don't know what's going on this display. I

1275
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:36,060
Speaker 1:  dunno. I had $1,600. I don't know why buying a stand that allows you to adjust

1276
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:38,220
Speaker 1:  the height is another $400.

1277
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:41,940
Speaker 4:  And the best part is if you make the wrong choice, when you buy it, you're

1278
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:44,190
Speaker 1:  Stuck. You're screwed. If you

1279
01:11:44,190 --> 01:11:46,740
Speaker 9:  Have the max, do you can plug five of them in,

1280
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:50,970
Speaker 1:  You can plug five, which is obviously important. And then in a

1281
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:54,180
Speaker 1:  dark room, you would have just a source of blinding light,

1282
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:55,650
Speaker 14:  Five gray panels.

1283
01:11:56,610 --> 01:12:00,120
Speaker 1:  People have been talking about like perfect blacks on displays since at least

1284
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:03,840
Speaker 1:  2007. Like that's when I went to CS and pioneer would have us

1285
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:07,830
Speaker 1:  in for their curl plasma demos, where they'd show

1286
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:11,330
Speaker 1:  you that all the other ones had gray backlights and the Kurose. I swear,

1287
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:14,090
Speaker 1:  we still have the curl plasma, man. You light that thing up. The Hotmail

1288
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:15,030
Speaker 1:  lights in our house, dim

1289
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,030
Speaker 1:  is an experience.

1290
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:19,500
Speaker 4:  75 pounds.

1291
01:12:19,650 --> 01:12:22,360
Speaker 1:  It's yeah, it's just, it's in another room and every now and again, I go

1292
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:25,440
Speaker 1:  and like lovingly gaze at it. We have to turn it on it,

1293
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:29,820
Speaker 1:  but I'm never throwing it away. It was like the first expensive TV I ever

1294
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:31,800
Speaker 1:  bought and weird keeping it until we're dead.

1295
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:33,660
Speaker 15:  So the whole neighborhood,

1296
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:37,890
Speaker 1:  But perfect black gloves.

1297
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:43,680
Speaker 1:  But that's like since 2007, we've been chasing after this and a

1298
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:47,430
Speaker 1:  $1,600 site from apple, which in every other category where it makes the

1299
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:51,390
Speaker 1:  displays makes the best one. It's utterly bonkers

1300
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:55,290
Speaker 1:  to me. Yeah. We'll see. We'll see if they can fix this webcam.

1301
01:12:55,290 --> 01:12:57,420
Speaker 1:  And maybe that will change things dramatically.

1302
01:12:57,570 --> 01:13:00,030
Speaker 3:  It'll also fix the black lights who knows

1303
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:04,170
Speaker 1:  He'll feel the software update to follow local. To me. That'd be incredible.

1304
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:08,730
Speaker 1:  All right. We started talking about this iPad. Monica, thank you so much.

1305
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:11,520
Speaker 1:  Thank you. We're going to take a quick break. We'll be right back

01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:21,000
Speaker 1:  prize and entire crew to coordinate. Luckily in the business world, there's

1308
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,750
Speaker 1:  a lot fewer sea monsters to navigate and a lot more HubSpot. HubSpot is an

1334
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:57,180
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. Actually, Monica is going to hang with us talking

1335
01:14:57,180 --> 01:15:01,000
Speaker 1:  about the Cypad, but Dan, you reviewed the iPad air. I did. I

1336
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,840
Speaker 1:  will tell the audience that I specifically deleted the line air conclusion

1337
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:08,440
Speaker 1:  where you're like, I have nothing to say about this computer. And I was like,

1338
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,210
Speaker 1:  no, that's your job on me. I

1339
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:11,680
Speaker 4:  Had this crisis of COVID.

1340
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:15,230
Speaker 9:  I can put that in 99% of my reviews. I want to listen.

1341
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:19,850
Speaker 4:  I will say that the fact that I had nothing really

1342
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:23,750
Speaker 4:  to complain about with the iPad is a Testament to how good the iPad areas.

1343
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:27,680
Speaker 4:  The iPad air is an excellent product and it is more excellent this year than

1344
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:31,460
Speaker 4:  it was two years ago when they last refreshed it, it is closer to the

1345
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:35,270
Speaker 4:  iPad pro experience than it's ever been before. And it's remarkable that

1346
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:39,110
Speaker 4:  it does it for $600. Like when you think about the original iPad

1347
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:42,830
Speaker 4:  came out in 2010 for 4 99, if you do the inflation

1348
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:46,280
Speaker 4:  calculation or whatever, it's going to be way more than 4 99 in today's dollars.

1349
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:50,090
Speaker 4:  This is giving you for $600. It's giving you basically

1350
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:54,350
Speaker 4:  Apple's fastest iPad processor, that same amount of Ram, as you get in a

1351
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:58,400
Speaker 4:  comparable storage, iPad pro it runs all the

1352
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:01,100
Speaker 4:  same software and everything like that. So it really obviates the need for

1353
01:16:01,130 --> 01:16:04,430
Speaker 4:  the iPad pro for a lot of people. There's some reasons you might want the

1354
01:16:04,430 --> 01:16:08,150
Speaker 4:  iPad pro, but fewer and far between. And it's just like a

1355
01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:11,330
Speaker 4:  really great iPad. And I think the other question that you had when we were

1356
01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:14,630
Speaker 4:  editing this draft Nila is like, well, why don't you just buy the

1357
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:18,560
Speaker 4:  $329 iPad if like they all run the same software and they all do the

1358
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:22,550
Speaker 4:  same thing. And yes, that's true. The, the air is like, if you just want

1359
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:26,420
Speaker 4:  a nicer experience, you want those nicer speakers. You want the nicer

1360
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:30,140
Speaker 4:  build quality. You want the flexibility to work with the newer pencil to

1361
01:16:30,140 --> 01:16:33,530
Speaker 4:  work with the magic keyboard. If you really want to it's compatible with

1362
01:16:33,530 --> 01:16:37,460
Speaker 4:  all the same accessories as the last model. And you just want to be

1363
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:40,130
Speaker 4:  able to have that iPad. That's going to last for five or six years. It's

1364
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:42,590
Speaker 4:  got all the headroom and all the power that you could want. You're not going

1365
01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:46,550
Speaker 4:  to hit the limit of the power of this thing right now, but

1366
01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:49,580
Speaker 4:  it'll last for a really long time, just like the iPhone se, except that you're

1367
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:53,510
Speaker 4:  not really making those same compromises you do on the iPhone se you're not

1368
01:16:53,510 --> 01:16:57,320
Speaker 4:  getting the old weird design. You're not getting a compromised

1369
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:58,460
Speaker 4:  screen experience.

1370
01:16:58,550 --> 01:17:00,050
Speaker 1:  That's what the $329,

1371
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:04,430
Speaker 4:  That's the $329. But the $329 iPad does use an

1372
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:08,240
Speaker 4:  older processor and things like that. So you're, you're like, you know, getting

1373
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:08,900
Speaker 4:  older,

1374
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:11,480
Speaker 3:  Smaller bezels too, right?

1375
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:15,440
Speaker 4:  Like, yeah, this is like the modern apple design ethos, right? It's got

1376
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:19,220
Speaker 4:  that uniform bezels across the, across the screen. So it

1377
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:22,280
Speaker 4:  feels exactly the same, whether you're using portrait or landscape, which

1378
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:25,820
Speaker 4:  is really nice. That's like a, kind of like an iPad hallmark. I've

1379
01:17:26,090 --> 01:17:29,630
Speaker 4:  tested a lot of review, reviewed a lot of tablets. I've got the stack of

1380
01:17:29,630 --> 01:17:32,810
Speaker 4:  Samsung tablets here that I'm going to spend time with next, finally promise

1381
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:36,530
Speaker 4:  you readers. We are working on them. We're not ignoring them. They do

1382
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:40,340
Speaker 4:  not have that flexibility to work as comfortably in portrait and landscape

1383
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:42,860
Speaker 4:  mode as the iPad does. And the iPad doesn't really well. And part of that

1384
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:45,350
Speaker 4:  is because of it's aspect ratio. And part of it is because the bezels around

1385
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:48,440
Speaker 4:  the screen are just all uniform. It doesn't really matter how you hold it.

1386
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:52,640
Speaker 4:  So it gives you like all the best experiences that the iPad

1387
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:56,600
Speaker 4:  offers for a price that is not a thousand dollars

1388
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:00,140
Speaker 4:  or $1,500 when you add an accessories and things like that. So it's like

1389
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:03,950
Speaker 4:  a really compelling type of tablet. If you're in the market for

1390
01:18:03,950 --> 01:18:07,880
Speaker 4:  this mid-size 10 inch 11 inch tablet, which is a really great

1391
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:08,720
Speaker 4:  tablet experience,

1392
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:12,320
Speaker 3:  Is the display better or worse than the Mac studio

1393
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:12,890
Speaker 3:  display?

1394
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:18,710
Speaker 4:  It's better because it's, it's, you know, it's, it's different.

1395
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:22,270
Speaker 4:  I mean, like, I don't know, like it's, if we go and qualify it on all the

1396
01:18:22,270 --> 01:18:25,460
Speaker 4:  things that, the map that we just qualified, the Mac studio display on, right?

1397
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:29,210
Speaker 4:  It doesn't have HDR. It maxes out at 500 minutes. So it doesn't have that

1398
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:33,320
Speaker 4:  HDR mini led experience that you get on the 12.9 inch iPad or the

1399
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:37,310
Speaker 4:  11 inch pro. So the 11 inch iPad pro does not have many led. So that's

1400
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:41,120
Speaker 4:  kind of why the 11 inch iPad pro and the iPad air are so similar

1401
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:44,570
Speaker 4:  because the screens are effectively the same, except for refresh rate.

1402
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:48,260
Speaker 4:  Interesting. You said you don't get the HDR, you don't get

1403
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:52,580
Speaker 4:  full array, local dimming or whatever. It's a, an LCD panel,

1404
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,780
Speaker 4:  but it is, you know, a great colors. It's plenty of brightness for use

1405
01:18:56,810 --> 01:19:00,050
Speaker 4:  in any situation that I really couldn't encounter in my time with it.

1406
01:19:00,830 --> 01:19:03,350
Speaker 4:  And it's, you know, super responsive for touch and everything like that.

1407
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:06,620
Speaker 4:  Like a typical iOS devices. So there's really very little to complain about

1408
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:10,580
Speaker 4:  with the screen. It is only 60 Hertz and it doesn't have promotion. And so

1409
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:14,390
Speaker 4:  for some folks who are, so we talked about this earlier, who, if you're

1410
01:19:14,390 --> 01:19:15,350
Speaker 4:  sensitive to

1411
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:18,140
Speaker 3:  Neil, I would be fine. You would not.

1412
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:21,290
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean, like if you're sensitive to refresh rates, you might see a

1413
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:25,010
Speaker 4:  smoother experience on the iPad pro because that does have the 120 Hertz

1414
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:28,970
Speaker 4:  screen. I think a big misconception is that you need

1415
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:32,810
Speaker 4:  the 120 Hertz screen for great stylist experience. And that's not really

1416
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:36,590
Speaker 4:  the case at all. You can have just as good Silas experience on the iPad air.

1417
01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:39,200
Speaker 4:  So if you're drawing or writing notes, I take a lot of handwritten notes

1418
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:42,470
Speaker 4:  on an iPad. I really didn't miss having 120 Hertz there.

1419
01:19:43,130 --> 01:19:47,000
Speaker 3:  The remarkable two has the best stylist experience out there

1420
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,970
Speaker 3:  right now. And it has a refresh rate of like one.

1421
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:54,830
Speaker 4:  Yeah, exactly. Like it's a wildly different technology there that your stack,

1422
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:57,530
Speaker 4:  but if you're comparing the air and the pro and you're like, I want to buy

1423
01:19:57,530 --> 01:20:00,140
Speaker 4:  the pro because I use the stylist all the time. It's like, well, maybe you

1424
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:03,980
Speaker 4:  don't really need the pro for your stylist work. There's a digital artist

1425
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:07,950
Speaker 4:  on YouTube that I like a lot because I can't draw for anything. And he's

1426
01:20:07,950 --> 01:20:11,670
Speaker 4:  actually pretty good at it. He tests all the tablets and he does the comparisons

1427
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:15,660
Speaker 4:  of like the stylist response in slow motion and like his

1428
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:19,530
Speaker 4:  ultimate conclusion, his name is Brad Cobell. You can find him on YouTube,

1429
01:20:19,710 --> 01:20:23,010
Speaker 4:  but like his ultimate conclusion is usually that the, there really isn't

1430
01:20:23,010 --> 01:20:26,520
Speaker 4:  that much of a noticeable difference with the slower refresh rate. So the

1431
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:30,030
Speaker 4:  reason that you would get the iPad pro are you get smoother scrolling when

1432
01:20:30,030 --> 01:20:33,540
Speaker 4:  you're interacting with it. Now, for me, what I use an iPad for is a lot

1433
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:37,500
Speaker 4:  of reading static text, and I don't need smooth refresh

1434
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:40,020
Speaker 4:  rates for that. Like, it's, it's just there. So like

1435
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:42,060
Speaker 9:  All your pages to be really smooth when they're turning.

1436
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:46,140
Speaker 4:  Yeah. You know, like I turned on the little page, turn animation and the

1437
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:49,790
Speaker 4:  Kindle app, so I can see the page curl over, which I, to every single time,

1438
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:53,250
Speaker 4:  like I turn it on every single time I viewed that at 120 Hertz,

1439
01:20:53,670 --> 01:20:57,030
Speaker 4:  but like, I really don't. So like when I was using the air, it like, I, I

1440
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:00,810
Speaker 4:  have, I own an 11 inch pro that's my personal iPad. And like, I

1441
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:04,110
Speaker 4:  didn't miss the pro screen at all. Like, I really didn't miss anything about

1442
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:06,240
Speaker 4:  the pro. That was the weird part about it was, well,

1443
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:07,260
Speaker 17:  You didn't miss face ID.

1444
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:11,370
Speaker 4:  Oh, I'm sorry. That is, yeah. You got the Alex. That is like

1445
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:15,270
Speaker 4:  the, the one experience difference that I think a

1446
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:18,960
Speaker 4:  lot of people will experience between the pro and the air. The air has the

1447
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:22,890
Speaker 4:  same touch ID system and its power button that they had on the 2020 models.

1448
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:25,530
Speaker 4:  So you've got to rest your finger on the power button to unlock it. It works

1449
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:29,280
Speaker 4:  very well. It recognizes your fingerprints very quickly. It's

1450
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:33,270
Speaker 4:  just not nearly as intuitive and seamless as the pro where you just tap the

1451
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:37,140
Speaker 4:  screen, it sees your face and you're in, right? Like it's, it's, it's like

1452
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:41,490
Speaker 4:  you have to stop put your finger on the button, wait for it to do its thing.

1453
01:21:41,490 --> 01:21:45,150
Speaker 4:  If you're like, you know, unlocking your password manager or buying an app

1454
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:47,490
Speaker 4:  or paying for something with apple pay, you got to stop, put your finger

1455
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:50,250
Speaker 4:  on the button and I'm never holding it where my fingers near the button.

1456
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:51,140
Speaker 4:  So I always have to like, do

1457
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:52,410
Speaker 1:  You always have it in the keyboard case?

1458
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:56,550
Speaker 4:  So I, for, you know, testing, I put it in the keyboard case. I think the

1459
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:59,820
Speaker 4:  keyboard case is great, but I don't think that this is the right iPad to

1460
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:03,060
Speaker 4:  buy. If you want to replace your laptop, because it's got a small screen.

1461
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:07,140
Speaker 4:  And like, I mean, most of the time for, you know, I think what this is really

1462
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:10,800
Speaker 4:  great at is that tablet experience, you are

1463
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:14,370
Speaker 4:  holding it in your hands. You're sitting on your couch, you're lying in bed

1464
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:17,100
Speaker 4:  or whatever. You're watching a movie, you're reading a book, you're reading

1465
01:22:17,130 --> 01:22:20,520
Speaker 4:  apple news or an article or something like that. And it gives you that nice

1466
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:24,120
Speaker 4:  large screen that is still comfortable to hold. As soon as you try to go

1467
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:28,080
Speaker 4:  into like a laptop work environment, you really run into the walls of

1468
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:31,740
Speaker 4:  this really quickly in terms of like the size of the screen and the limitations

1469
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:35,310
Speaker 4:  that iPad iOS puts on you for multi-tasking file management, all the things

1470
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:39,150
Speaker 4:  that we've beaten to death for a couple of years now. And if you are

1471
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:42,480
Speaker 4:  intending on like replacing your laptop, I strongly recommend you consider

1472
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:46,470
Speaker 4:  just going whole hog out to the 13 inch model. But then you give up the tablet

1473
01:22:46,470 --> 01:22:49,500
Speaker 4:  experience because the 12.9 inch iPad, it's kind of a crummy tablet when

1474
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:53,010
Speaker 4:  you take it out of its case. So that's kind of where I sit with it. It's

1475
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:56,670
Speaker 4:  a really great tablet experience. And I don't really knock iOS. iPad was

1476
01:22:56,700 --> 01:23:00,630
Speaker 4:  all that hard for it's like lack of laptop experience in the review,

1477
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:03,330
Speaker 4:  because I think a lot of people are going to experiences mostly as a tablet.

1478
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:07,570
Speaker 1:  We'll see. I mean, I have an 11 inch pro, which I clearly

1479
01:23:07,570 --> 01:23:10,000
Speaker 1:  don't use enough cause I didn't even remember what kind of display it had.

1480
01:23:11,650 --> 01:23:14,530
Speaker 1:  The most used iPad in our house is my kids

1481
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:18,550
Speaker 1:  $329 iPad, which runs exactly two apps, Disney

1482
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:22,060
Speaker 1:  plus and YouTube kids. And one is the one I wanted to use. And the other

1483
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:24,610
Speaker 1:  one is full of garbage. It's poisoning her mind. And that's the one that

1484
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:26,980
Speaker 1:  she wants to use. We'll, we'll let the audience try and

1485
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:27,310
Speaker 4:  Figure out

1486
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:31,300
Speaker 1:  Which one's, which Disney plus. Right. But it's like, that's what

1487
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:35,080
Speaker 1:  that thing is for. And it, the thing is trashed and it's fine. And then

1488
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:37,630
Speaker 1:  I think most people, like if you've got the money to spend, you're going

1489
01:23:37,630 --> 01:23:40,870
Speaker 1:  to want the nicer one. This is just how companies price products and create

1490
01:23:40,870 --> 01:23:44,590
Speaker 1:  tiers. But then it's like, well, if I'm they're so

1491
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:47,410
Speaker 1:  close in price, especially once you start factoring in the story.

1492
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:50,470
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So my big complaint about the iPad era was that it still comes with

1493
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:53,920
Speaker 4:  only 64 gigs of storage, which I think we talked about this last week, but

1494
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:57,460
Speaker 4:  like my perception did not change throughout the process of the review. So

1495
01:23:57,460 --> 01:24:01,030
Speaker 4:  my review unit was at 256 gig model. I just kind of like cloned my

1496
01:24:01,090 --> 01:24:05,020
Speaker 4:  iCloud account onto it and loaded all my iPad apps that I use. And I'm

1497
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:08,950
Speaker 4:  at 87 gigs. So 64 gigs right off the bat. It's like, no good for

1498
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:12,550
Speaker 4:  me, someone who's had an iPad for a couple of years, doesn't rely on it for

1499
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:16,480
Speaker 4:  like work stuff. I just kinda like use it as an iPad. I think if

1500
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:20,410
Speaker 4:  apple had gone to 1 28 with this as a base, it would have been

1501
01:24:20,410 --> 01:24:24,370
Speaker 4:  great because the upgrade is $150 more and it goes all the way to

1502
01:24:24,370 --> 01:24:28,060
Speaker 4:  2 56 right away. And then you are like $50

1503
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:32,050
Speaker 4:  away from the 1 28 gig iPad pro, which now you're like, oh, should I

1504
01:24:32,050 --> 01:24:34,920
Speaker 4:  just spend 50 bucks and give up that half that story?

1505
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:38,860
Speaker 1:  This is, they did this on purpose. This is like Phil Schiller

1506
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:42,490
Speaker 1:  and his pricing matrix. It's like, I'm going to torture them, torture them

1507
01:24:42,490 --> 01:24:45,730
Speaker 1:  and spending a little bit more money. Right? Like I think that all makes

1508
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:49,450
Speaker 1:  sense. I, the one place I disagree with you and I don't travel as

1509
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:53,110
Speaker 1:  nearly as much as I used to, the reason I bought the 11 inch iPad pro and

1510
01:24:53,110 --> 01:24:56,830
Speaker 1:  the keyboard case, which is a very expensive, tiny little laptop was it is

1511
01:24:56,830 --> 01:25:00,760
Speaker 1:  great for traveling. And it's especially great for airplanes because,

1512
01:25:01,030 --> 01:25:04,780
Speaker 1:  because I thought it was just like this endless single-tasking cannot be

1513
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:08,590
Speaker 1:  broken. It doesn't try to use Gogo data the way that like your laptop

1514
01:25:08,590 --> 01:25:09,010
Speaker 1:  does.

1515
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:12,970
Speaker 4:  I think in that scenario. And I agree with you because back when I commuted,

1516
01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:17,110
Speaker 4:  when that was like a regular thing for me, I use an iPad on the train every

1517
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:20,620
Speaker 4:  single day. It had built in cellular connection and that was like my train

1518
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:24,070
Speaker 4:  computer, or it's a great plane computer. And it's a great travel computer

1519
01:25:24,070 --> 01:25:27,490
Speaker 4:  because the, I think the boundaries of iPad S

1520
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:31,750
Speaker 4:  really mesh nicely with the boundaries of that environment that you're in.

1521
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:34,630
Speaker 4:  You're not going to be the most productive on a train. You're not gonna be

1522
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:37,630
Speaker 4:  the most productive on a play. And you're going to bang out emails, write

1523
01:25:37,630 --> 01:25:40,270
Speaker 4:  documents, you know, one at a time, things like that. You're not bouncing

1524
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:43,450
Speaker 4:  between tasks and things like that. You're not shuffling files around a lot

1525
01:25:43,450 --> 01:25:46,420
Speaker 4:  in those scenarios. And I think the limitations bipedal has, and, and frankly

1526
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:49,510
Speaker 4:  for me, the limitations of chromo has worked really well in those environments.

1527
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:53,800
Speaker 4:  And I can be as productive as I possibly can be with that device, but

1528
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:57,760
Speaker 4:  it is not replacing my laptop because as soon as I get to wherever I'm

1529
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:01,630
Speaker 4:  going, I'm not using the iPad anymore. I'm using my laptop or I'm

1530
01:26:01,630 --> 01:26:05,480
Speaker 4:  using a proper computer because it does give me that flexibility

1531
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:09,260
Speaker 4:  where I'm in an environment that I can be more productive. So like the

1532
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:12,410
Speaker 4:  keyboard case is excellent for that type of purpose. And I actually really

1533
01:26:12,410 --> 01:26:16,100
Speaker 4:  like typing on the magic keyboard, even though it's small. Like I weirdly

1534
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:19,910
Speaker 4:  get very comfortable on it very quickly and, and I can type very well on

1535
01:26:19,910 --> 01:26:23,900
Speaker 4:  that. But like once I get to the office, the iPad staying in my

1536
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:27,120
Speaker 4:  bag, cause I'm just using my laptop, which is even bigger and more comfortable

1537
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:31,040
Speaker 4:  and I have more space and I'm more flexible there. So I, I don't think it

1538
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:34,820
Speaker 4:  replaces my laptop. When you start to add all these things together though,

1539
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:38,690
Speaker 4:  like 600 bucks for the air $300 for the

1540
01:26:38,690 --> 01:26:42,620
Speaker 4:  keyboard. If you want to get the pencil, now you're at a thousand dollars.

1541
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:46,790
Speaker 4:  That's a Mac book air with the same processor, twice a store, four

1542
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:47,540
Speaker 4:  times the storage.

1543
01:26:47,690 --> 01:26:51,320
Speaker 1:  Right. But it's not as much fun to use. I've I've, I've the reason I had

1544
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:54,890
Speaker 1:  a 12 inch MacBook with the single port for the longest

1545
01:26:54,890 --> 01:26:58,850
Speaker 1:  time was cause it was just like the right size for an airplane. Sure.

1546
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:02,570
Speaker 4:  But, but as soon as you got off that airplane, you weren't using that anymore.

1547
01:27:02,570 --> 01:27:02,930
Speaker 4:  Right?

1548
01:27:03,830 --> 01:27:07,670
Speaker 1:  Well, presumably I had, I had arrived at a destination where I was going

1549
01:27:07,670 --> 01:27:11,570
Speaker 1:  to talk to other people and not like immediately. So you see my laptop, like

1550
01:27:11,570 --> 01:27:14,600
Speaker 1:  that's like the saddest plane right in the world where we're different people

1551
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:17,870
Speaker 1:  that have clearly, it's like, you know, here's what I do. I've I've arrived.

1552
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:22,010
Speaker 1:  I'm going to go to my hotel room and set up my three displays rock

1553
01:27:22,010 --> 01:27:22,490
Speaker 1:  out. Like,

1554
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:26,180
Speaker 9:  And without your Mac studio set up your five displays, a new TV.

1555
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:30,680
Speaker 1:  Exactly. I brought my iMac with me. I don't

1556
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:33,650
Speaker 1:  know. I don't remember what traveling is like. It was a different life. I

1557
01:27:33,650 --> 01:27:37,550
Speaker 1:  was a different person back then. So I've had air seems great. It

1558
01:27:37,550 --> 01:27:41,510
Speaker 1:  feels like if you need to buy an iPad right now that one's

1559
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:45,290
Speaker 1:  fine, but we would probably expect new iPad pros

1560
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:47,090
Speaker 1:  the end of the year. Yeah.

1561
01:27:47,210 --> 01:27:49,880
Speaker 4:  It's weird. If you're, if you've been paying attention to that rumor mill,

1562
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:53,030
Speaker 4:  that's like they go back and forth every other week, new iPad pros are coming

1563
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:56,120
Speaker 4:  this year. They're not coming this year. They will bring the million mini

1564
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:59,180
Speaker 4:  led screen down to the elephant inch. Oh, they're not going to do that this

1565
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:03,020
Speaker 4:  year. So it's like really hard to suss out whether we're going to see new

1566
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:06,890
Speaker 4:  iPad pros is here. I will say that they released new iPad

1567
01:28:06,890 --> 01:28:10,670
Speaker 4:  pros last year, less spring-ish. And the

1568
01:28:10,670 --> 01:28:14,510
Speaker 4:  iPad pro is typically on an 18 to 24 month upgrade cycle per

1569
01:28:14,510 --> 01:28:17,990
Speaker 4:  history. So my money would be on early

1570
01:28:17,990 --> 01:28:21,950
Speaker 4:  20, 23 for an iPad pro, but the supply chain kind

1571
01:28:21,950 --> 01:28:24,260
Speaker 4:  of mix everything up. So you can't really predict all that easily anymore.

1572
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:28,220
Speaker 4:  So I don't know. It's hard to say if you're buying today, I would say

1573
01:28:28,490 --> 01:28:31,130
Speaker 4:  the air should probably be your first choice. If you're looking for a great

1574
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:35,030
Speaker 4:  iPad experience, make sure you can deal with that. 64 gigs of storage. If

1575
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:38,150
Speaker 4:  not, then you're looking at upgrading the storage and then you're in this

1576
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:42,080
Speaker 4:  world, weird world of, should I buy the pro or not? And frankly, I

1577
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:44,840
Speaker 4:  don't know if I can help you too much there. You just gotta look into your

1578
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:47,600
Speaker 4:  heart and decide which one is the better one for you.

1579
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:50,960
Speaker 1:  If you want face ID it's is it face ID, right?

1580
01:28:52,010 --> 01:28:55,370
Speaker 4:  It could be the 120 Hertz. I don't think it's the four speakers. Like I couldn't

1581
01:28:55,370 --> 01:28:58,010
Speaker 4:  hear a difference between the two speakers on the air and the four speakers

1582
01:28:58,010 --> 01:29:01,320
Speaker 4:  on the pro non-significant difference there. It's definitely not the

1583
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:05,040
Speaker 4:  0.1 inch larger screen. Cause it's 10.9. There's

1584
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:09,030
Speaker 4:  11. Yeah. That's not it. And maybe it's,

1585
01:29:09,030 --> 01:29:12,720
Speaker 4:  you know, the, the 120 Hertz screen. I didn't, we even talk about this at

1586
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:16,200
Speaker 4:  all. That air now has an optional 5g, but it's only six sub

1587
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:19,980
Speaker 4:  six. It works. If you get 5g on the

1588
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:23,910
Speaker 4:  pro it's millimeter wave, which great if you can find it, but

1589
01:29:23,910 --> 01:29:27,780
Speaker 4:  that 5g upgrade on the pro cost $200 and the 5g upgrade on this

1590
01:29:28,050 --> 01:29:31,560
Speaker 4:  kind of air costs 150. So you have to pay more for that millimeter wave that

1591
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:32,190
Speaker 4:  you probably won't get.

1592
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:35,250
Speaker 1:  You're just standing under a street corner with an 11 inch iPad pro

1593
01:29:36,510 --> 01:29:38,610
Speaker 4:  You get two extra, you get an extra camera in the back. So you're taking

1594
01:29:38,610 --> 01:29:42,210
Speaker 4:  pictures with your iPad and more meter with of, of the millimeter wave tower.

1595
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:46,710
Speaker 1:  Everyone's like, look at that rich guy. That's staggering display every well

1596
01:29:46,770 --> 01:29:47,010
Speaker 1:  gets

1597
01:29:47,010 --> 01:29:48,420
Speaker 4:  So many cameras

1598
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:51,690
Speaker 1:  From this extra camera and millimeter wave.

1599
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:53,310
Speaker 1:  Who is that? And the

1600
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:54,840
Speaker 9:  Keyboard case attached

1601
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:57,120
Speaker 1:  Warren buffet.

1602
01:29:59,430 --> 01:30:03,060
Speaker 1:  All right. A couple of we're way over couple of notes,

1603
01:30:03,090 --> 01:30:07,020
Speaker 1:  universal control also hit Mac iOS, iOS, iPad, iOS

1604
01:30:07,830 --> 01:30:11,670
Speaker 1:  . So now you can just like scoot a mouse, like magic.

1605
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:12,450
Speaker 4:  Very clever.

1606
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:16,470
Speaker 1:  It is very cool. It works really well. If you've got an iPad and Mac,

1607
01:30:16,710 --> 01:30:20,010
Speaker 1:  although you have to upgrade your max Monterey, which yes you do. Th that's

1608
01:30:20,010 --> 01:30:23,000
Speaker 1:  how they get you. Also, the studio display requires Monterey, which is like

1609
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:27,150
Speaker 1:  the monitor, but it's got a whole computer. Yeah. That's why I

1610
01:30:27,150 --> 01:30:28,380
Speaker 1:  definitely doesn't need

1611
01:30:30,330 --> 01:30:34,320
Speaker 1:  a very confusing, whatever two things I want to call out.

1612
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:38,280
Speaker 1:  Mia Sato, our platforms and communities reporter, and the creators ask

1613
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:42,090
Speaker 1:  big Vimeo story Sauvignon, pivoted away from being a YouTube competitor to

1614
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:46,020
Speaker 1:  being like this B2B video provider. But now the creators and the

1615
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:49,800
Speaker 1:  platforms are being asked to pay thousands of dollars for hosting fees.

1616
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:53,640
Speaker 1:  They're not happy. That's a great story. You should read it. She also had

1617
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:57,900
Speaker 1:  an incredible story about Ukrainian influencers who are on tick tock,

1618
01:30:58,140 --> 01:31:02,130
Speaker 1:  tick tock stuff like tussle, like business hustle

1619
01:31:02,130 --> 01:31:05,190
Speaker 1:  advice, and like workout tips. And now they're all like war correspondence.

1620
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:09,270
Speaker 1:  It is remarkable. It's like a great verge story. It's about how people

1621
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:13,230
Speaker 1:  dramatically changed the way they use the tools they have when circumstances

1622
01:31:13,230 --> 01:31:16,800
Speaker 1:  change. There's the way out. Great. You got to go read it. And then lastly,

1623
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:20,520
Speaker 1:  this is just a fun one. Jason Snell, who used to be editor of Macworld magazine.

1624
01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:24,120
Speaker 1:  When the Mac studio was announced, I was like, this thing reminds me of this

1625
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:28,410

1626
01:31:28,410 --> 01:31:32,400
Speaker 1:  like all these pictures of old Mac magazines and like why people wanted Mac

1627
01:31:32,430 --> 01:31:34,800
Speaker 1:  something like a Mac studio. It was just a great story. It's called the Mac

1628
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,800
Speaker 1:  studio Smith fulfillment. If you're in a computer history, it's really good
