Description: The Verge's Thomas Ricker joins the show with an update on his question to live the #vanlife. He shares stories about Starlink Mini, the new Peak Design backpack everyone loves, converting a Sprinter van to a mobile apartment, and more. Then, The Verge's Andru Marino takes us through his tests on a bunch of new creator- and social-friendly microphones, which plug into your phone and promise to make everything sound better. Finally, we answer a question about web browsers on the Vergecast Hotline.

00:00:03,265 --> 00:00:06,795
Speaker 2:  Welcome To, The Vergecast, the flagship podcast. Van

3
00:00:06,865 --> 00:00:10,155
Speaker 2:  Toilets. I'm your friend David Pierce. And can I just complain about something

4
00:00:10,155 --> 00:00:13,275
Speaker 2:  just for one quick second? When did video games become

5
00:00:13,995 --> 00:00:17,395
Speaker 2:  homework? So it was just the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States, which

6
00:00:17,395 --> 00:00:21,075
Speaker 2:  means I spent a few days mostly not in front of screens,

7
00:00:21,145 --> 00:00:24,915
Speaker 2:  playing games with my family and reading. It was also my kids' birthday.

8
00:00:24,915 --> 00:00:28,875
Speaker 2:  So we did a lot of birthday stuff and then I come back and I turn

9
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:32,835
Speaker 2:  on my switch to play some FIFA or EA sports FC whatever you

10
00:00:32,835 --> 00:00:36,155
Speaker 2:  wanna call it. And it's like here's all the limited edition Black Friday

11
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:39,675
Speaker 2:  stuff that you missed and now everyone you play against is way ahead of you

12
00:00:39,675 --> 00:00:42,755
Speaker 2:  because they got all these cool upgrades and things that you didn't because

13
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:46,035
Speaker 2:  you weren't on your console for 12 hours a day all weekend.

14
00:00:47,115 --> 00:00:51,035
Speaker 2:  I generally love that video games are more multiplayer than ever and

15
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:54,475
Speaker 2:  are more sort of global than ever and that there are lots of different modes

16
00:00:54,475 --> 00:00:57,675
Speaker 2:  and ways to compete and you're kind of doing other things against real people

17
00:00:57,695 --> 00:01:01,635
Speaker 2:  all the time. But that comes now with this idea that you have to be

18
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:05,635
Speaker 2:  in it all the time or risk being left behind. I get why

19
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:09,555
Speaker 2:  the game companies do it. I hate it. I hate the feeling like I have

20
00:01:09,555 --> 00:01:13,035
Speaker 2:  to be in a discord and I have to grind. People call it a grind. Now

21
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:17,275
Speaker 2:  video games are not supposed to be a grind. I

22
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:20,115
Speaker 2:  hate it. I'm going to keep doing it and I'm going to keep playing it because

23
00:01:20,355 --> 00:01:22,835
Speaker 2:  ultimately I like the game. And the game is fun when you're good at it and

24
00:01:22,835 --> 00:01:25,555
Speaker 2:  it's less fun when you're bad at it. And that is what these companies know

25
00:01:25,555 --> 00:01:29,315
Speaker 2:  and it's how they get you. But it drives me nuts. Anyway,

26
00:01:29,785 --> 00:01:33,435
Speaker 2:  that is not what we're here to talk about today. We are here to do two things.

27
00:01:33,445 --> 00:01:36,555
Speaker 2:  We're back from Thanksgiving. We got lots to do. News is still happening,

28
00:01:36,665 --> 00:01:40,595
Speaker 2:  lots to talk about. First we're gonna talk to Thomas Ricker, who is the verges,

29
00:01:40,755 --> 00:01:44,715
Speaker 2:  I guess like unofficial Vanlife correspondent. He is gonna

30
00:01:44,715 --> 00:01:48,435
Speaker 2:  tell us about his adventures with new outdoor batteries. He's tested a backpack.

31
00:01:48,595 --> 00:01:51,635
Speaker 2:  A lot of people are really interested in. He tested starlink Mini, which

32
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:54,915
Speaker 2:  I have lots of questions about. He's gonna give us the rundown on all the

33
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:58,795
Speaker 2:  new stuff for kind of outdoor adventurous living. Then we're gonna talk

34
00:01:58,795 --> 00:02:02,155
Speaker 2:  to Andrew Marino about microphones. We've done a lot of these tests with

35
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:05,515
Speaker 2:  Andrew and I'm actually really excited about this one. He's been testing

36
00:02:05,665 --> 00:02:09,315
Speaker 2:  some of the new creator mics, the DJI ones and the road ones. The ones that

37
00:02:09,315 --> 00:02:12,715
Speaker 2:  you can just kind of clip to a collar and connect to your phone or your camera

38
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:16,035
Speaker 2:  that make it really easy to get good audio almost anywhere.

39
00:02:16,575 --> 00:02:20,395
Speaker 2:  He has some really fun takeaways and I'm gonna quiz him and

40
00:02:20,395 --> 00:02:23,275
Speaker 2:  we're gonna hear on some of how these actually sound.

41
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:27,515
Speaker 2:  The answer spoiler alert is don't use that stupid one that everybody uses

42
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:31,275
Speaker 2:  on TikTok, the like lapel mic that people just hold like this drives me nuts

43
00:02:31,815 --> 00:02:35,795
Speaker 2:  as you're gonna hear. Sounds awful. Don't use it. We also have

44
00:02:35,795 --> 00:02:38,435
Speaker 2:  a hotline about web browsers that I'm very excited about because as you know,

45
00:02:38,435 --> 00:02:41,875
Speaker 2:  web browsers are near and dear to my heart. All of that is coming up in just

46
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:45,515
Speaker 2:  a second. But first. Even as I'm saying this, I realize I have to go play

47
00:02:45,585 --> 00:02:49,355
Speaker 2:  FIFA now because there's like some stuff I need to get and some

48
00:02:49,615 --> 00:02:53,355
Speaker 2:  XP I gotta get in order to catch up. So I'm gonna go finish that, get caught

49
00:02:53,355 --> 00:02:56,315
Speaker 2:  up and then we're gonna get into it. This is The Vergecast, we'll be right

50
00:02:56,315 --> 00:02:56,475
Speaker 2:  back.

51
00:03:52,595 --> 00:03:56,165
Speaker 5:  roadmap of product features we've always wanted to add. So If, you can help

52
00:03:56,165 --> 00:03:59,765
Speaker 5:  support us by signing up at The Verge dot com slash subs and If, you can't.

53
00:03:59,765 --> 00:04:01,925
Speaker 5:  We'll do everything we can to earn your support in the future.

54
00:04:05,605 --> 00:04:09,095
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. Alright, I have played some EA sports

55
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:13,095
Speaker 2:  fc, I've done my best. I still missed a bunch of stuff, but I'm

56
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:16,975
Speaker 2:  slightly caught up. I'm doing my best to not spend a lot of money inside

57
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:19,895
Speaker 2:  of this game, so help me stay strong and we will

58
00:04:20,175 --> 00:04:24,055
Speaker 2:  aggressively lose to very good players together all the time. Alright,

59
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:27,935
Speaker 2:  let's get into it. First up, Vanlife Thomas Ricker was on the show

60
00:04:28,055 --> 00:04:31,855
Speaker 2:  a while ago to talk about some of the gear that he's been using on his

61
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:35,695
Speaker 2:  adventures. Thomas is potentially the coolest person at The

62
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,575
Speaker 2:  Verge. He's always like on a Friday afternoon like, oh, I have to leave a

63
00:04:39,575 --> 00:04:43,535
Speaker 2:  few minutes early, I'm going kite surfing for the weekend. Or like, oh, I'm

64
00:04:43,535 --> 00:04:47,175
Speaker 2:  gonna be out of touch for nine days because I'm Glacier hiking or

65
00:04:47,575 --> 00:04:51,415
Speaker 2:  whatever. He is forever on adventures and is

66
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:54,975
Speaker 2:  forever trying to find the right tech to take on his adventures. It's been

67
00:04:54,975 --> 00:04:58,015
Speaker 2:  a minute since we caught up with him and he's also been reviewing a whole

68
00:04:58,015 --> 00:05:01,215
Speaker 2:  bunch of interesting stuff, whether it's power sources or

69
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:05,775
Speaker 2:  batteries that go with those power sources or he did a really fun review

70
00:05:05,835 --> 00:05:09,775
Speaker 2:  of some cooking gear on the site. He got a new Peak Design

71
00:05:10,055 --> 00:05:13,135
Speaker 2:  backpack. People are excited about So I figured we'd just have him on and

72
00:05:13,315 --> 00:05:16,895
Speaker 2:  run down some of what's new, what's made it into his setup, how he's feeling

73
00:05:16,895 --> 00:05:20,615
Speaker 2:  about his adventures, what works, what doesn't, where we can go next. And

74
00:05:20,635 --> 00:05:24,535
Speaker 2:  listen, I can't have his adventures. I'm not cool enough, but I

75
00:05:24,535 --> 00:05:27,535
Speaker 2:  can live vicariously through Thomas. So that's what we're gonna do here.

76
00:05:27,545 --> 00:05:29,855
Speaker 2:  Let's get into it. Thomas Ricker. Hello.

77
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,055
Speaker 4:  Hello. David Pierce. How are you doing?

78
00:05:32,435 --> 00:05:36,255
Speaker 2:  I'm good. You are the only person. I think this is a fun question

79
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:39,495
Speaker 2:  to ask on a podcast, but where in the world are you right now?

80
00:05:40,185 --> 00:05:43,975
Speaker 4:  Today I'm actually at home in Amsterdam. I am arranging to pick up my

81
00:05:44,235 --> 00:05:48,055
Speaker 4:  van hopefully next week. I got a couple weeks off, had a lot of holiday

82
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:52,055
Speaker 4:  that accumulated by the end of the year. So hopefully I can

83
00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:55,895
Speaker 4:  maybe disappear into the black forest of Germany. I don't know, we'll see

84
00:05:55,895 --> 00:05:56,215
Speaker 4:  what happens.

85
00:05:56,765 --> 00:05:59,805
Speaker 2:  Well, okay, I was gonna ask, do you have, are, is the van being worked on,

86
00:05:59,805 --> 00:06:02,325
Speaker 2:  but this is where I actually wanna start. You haven't been on the show in

87
00:06:02,325 --> 00:06:06,245
Speaker 2:  a while and the last time you were on, you just kind of gave us a

88
00:06:06,245 --> 00:06:09,965
Speaker 2:  rundown of like your your vanlife gear and I have some stuff I wanna talk

89
00:06:09,965 --> 00:06:13,485
Speaker 2:  about. You've been reviewing a lot of gadgets, but mostly I just want to

90
00:06:13,485 --> 00:06:17,285
Speaker 2:  get like a, a current picture of the setup. What's in your

91
00:06:17,825 --> 00:06:21,525
Speaker 2:  van slash bag slash I don't know, bike

92
00:06:21,725 --> 00:06:23,965
Speaker 2:  sack these days? What's new to the setup?

93
00:06:24,545 --> 00:06:28,205
Speaker 4:  I'm not, man, I'm not even sure that we had bought the van last time we spoke,

94
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:32,285
Speaker 4:  but at the beginning of the summer we actually, I guess it was

95
00:06:32,285 --> 00:06:36,165
Speaker 4:  in the spring, we pulled the trigger on a, on a kind of a lifelong dream.

96
00:06:36,175 --> 00:06:39,245
Speaker 4:  We've been saving for a long time and we bought a

97
00:06:39,675 --> 00:06:43,325
Speaker 4:  Mercedes-Benz Sprinter. It sounds fancy 'cause it's a

98
00:06:43,485 --> 00:06:47,325
Speaker 4:  Mercedes-Benz, but this is basically the delivery truck that DHL uses and

99
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:51,125
Speaker 4:  everybody else here in, in Europe. It's a cargo van.

100
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:55,445
Speaker 4:  So I'm also old now. And while it was really

101
00:06:56,005 --> 00:06:59,645
Speaker 4:  interesting the idea of rebuilding it myself, learning how to do that,

102
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:03,765
Speaker 4:  I don't have time to make a bunch of mistakes fair. I also don't have a

103
00:07:03,765 --> 00:07:07,725
Speaker 4:  garage to do that work. So I farmed it out to a local van

104
00:07:07,725 --> 00:07:10,365
Speaker 4:  builder. I've actually written a few stories with this guy. That's how I

105
00:07:10,605 --> 00:07:14,565
Speaker 4:  met him. So just decided to, to hire him to,

106
00:07:14,565 --> 00:07:18,525
Speaker 4:  to help with the build. But we're doing it in phases, that's why. So we did

107
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,965
Speaker 4:  a first phase. We traveled around Portugal and northern Spain for the summer.

108
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:26,485
Speaker 4:  That was like, that took a, a month or two to do that build and now it's

109
00:07:26,485 --> 00:07:30,405
Speaker 4:  back to get it ready for winter. 'cause we want to take it like

110
00:07:30,405 --> 00:07:34,285
Speaker 4:  park at a ski resort and just go snowboarding for a

111
00:07:34,285 --> 00:07:37,285
Speaker 4:  few weeks. There's a, there's a certain amount of freedom and things you

112
00:07:37,285 --> 00:07:40,965
Speaker 4:  can do. Hobbies, you can pursue If, you have your whole home with you.

113
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:42,725
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So that's kind of what we're doing.

114
00:07:43,035 --> 00:07:46,565
Speaker 2:  Okay. So what's in this current build, like you said, getting it ready for

115
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:47,805
Speaker 2:  the winter. What does that actually entail?

116
00:07:48,905 --> 00:07:52,125
Speaker 4:  So the big thing is getting the diesel heater set up.

117
00:07:52,615 --> 00:07:56,525
Speaker 4:  Right now we're just using the, the, the standard heater that comes with

118
00:07:56,525 --> 00:08:00,445
Speaker 4:  the Mercedes-Benz. It's a optional thing. Van builders, there's a, a

119
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:04,325
Speaker 4:  wide variety of heating options. You often do an aftermarket thing that you

120
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:08,005
Speaker 4:  stick under a seat. Ours comes standard or ours comes from

121
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:11,765
Speaker 4:  Mercedes. So it's nice 'cause you can use it from an app. You can like

122
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:15,285
Speaker 4:  turn it on when you're remote, you can have it running and you can monitor

123
00:08:15,505 --> 00:08:17,765
Speaker 4:  the, the temperature while you're on the ski slopes, for example.

124
00:08:19,305 --> 00:08:23,205
Speaker 4:  But we put a storage bench on top of it and inside that storage bench

125
00:08:23,225 --> 00:08:27,205
Speaker 4:  is our toilet. So we have to properly route

126
00:08:27,315 --> 00:08:30,365
Speaker 4:  that heating so it doesn't heat up our toilet too much

127
00:08:32,035 --> 00:08:35,845
Speaker 2:  Because like a, like a warm toilet is a nice thing. A a two warm toilet

128
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:36,925
Speaker 2:  problems.

129
00:08:37,315 --> 00:08:41,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And this is small space and there are smell issues potentially.

130
00:08:41,545 --> 00:08:45,125
Speaker 4:  So yeah, we're trying to, we're trying to do that. So that's what, that's

131
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:49,005
Speaker 4:  what he's doing and he says he is got it ready for a first test.

132
00:08:49,225 --> 00:08:52,005
Speaker 4:  So I'll hopefully have that ready this weekend.

133
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:56,365
Speaker 2:  Okay. That's really exciting. Is this, like, I would imagine the, the moment

134
00:08:56,385 --> 00:09:00,125
Speaker 2:  you get the van for the winter is like a, like a real sort of

135
00:09:00,155 --> 00:09:03,925
Speaker 2:  sending off on your voyage kind of moment, like setting sail on the ship

136
00:09:04,005 --> 00:09:05,525
Speaker 2:  hundreds of years ago, kind of vibe.

137
00:09:06,235 --> 00:09:09,525
Speaker 4:  Yeah, and, and I'm brand new to this So I have a lot of questions. I mean

138
00:09:09,585 --> 00:09:13,445
Speaker 4:  we, we, we put on these, these big rugged four by four off-road tires.

139
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:17,365
Speaker 4:  We have a lift kit on it, but like certain countries have certain

140
00:09:17,365 --> 00:09:20,565
Speaker 4:  requirements for chains. Like do I need to put chains when I'm driving through

141
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:24,365
Speaker 4:  Austria? So there's just a lot of preparation that has to take

142
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:28,285
Speaker 4:  place to, to even get onto the road for the first time. But then

143
00:09:28,285 --> 00:09:31,845
Speaker 4:  there's, it is also a matter of packing and unpacking. 'cause it is a small

144
00:09:31,845 --> 00:09:35,725
Speaker 4:  amount of space for a van. It is a huge, what we call the garage. So all

145
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:39,205
Speaker 4:  that space for storage in the back. But now we're swapping out like our kite

146
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:42,965
Speaker 4:  surfing gear for snowboarding stuff. We have to figure out what to do

147
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:46,485
Speaker 4:  when the boots are wet and icy and snowy and how we can collect that

148
00:09:46,925 --> 00:09:50,845
Speaker 4:  moisture that's gonna develop when things melt inside the van. What do we

149
00:09:50,845 --> 00:09:53,885
Speaker 4:  store on the outside of the van? We also have cargo like attached to the

150
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:57,845
Speaker 4:  back, which looks really, really cool. I'm not sure how functional

151
00:09:57,845 --> 00:10:00,525
Speaker 4:  it's gonna be yet, but we're gonna find out. Okay. Like, I don't know if

152
00:10:00,525 --> 00:10:03,005
Speaker 4:  my, if like, do I put my boots back there? Are they gonna be frozen when

153
00:10:03,005 --> 00:10:05,805
Speaker 4:  I pick them up in the morning? Do I have to keep those inside? So yeah, like

154
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:09,765
Speaker 4:  I said, I'm, I'm totally new to this. So it's a big learning curve, but there

155
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:13,605
Speaker 4:  are so many great forums and, and and a community as well

156
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:15,165
Speaker 4:  that's very willing to help.

157
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:19,765
Speaker 2:  I'm, I'm struck by how much more sort of

158
00:10:19,965 --> 00:10:23,165
Speaker 2:  straightforwardly practical a lot of this stuff is than I would think. Like,

159
00:10:23,485 --> 00:10:27,405
Speaker 2:  I think when, when you, you see, you know, YouTube videos are like shows

160
00:10:27,405 --> 00:10:30,125
Speaker 2:  that they've made over the years about making this kind of stuff and it's

161
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:33,565
Speaker 2:  all like cool flashy stuff that you can do and

162
00:10:34,045 --> 00:10:36,685
Speaker 2:  interesting, like bells and whistles you can add to these things. But you're

163
00:10:36,685 --> 00:10:39,365
Speaker 2:  talking about like heating and I, I was going back through a bunch of stories

164
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:42,245
Speaker 2:  you've written through this journey and you're like, you are obsessed with

165
00:10:42,245 --> 00:10:45,325
Speaker 2:  how to power things and, and it's just, it's such a

166
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:49,525
Speaker 2:  simple thing but in the guise of what you're talking about, like, it, it's,

167
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:52,325
Speaker 2:  it's just so simple and straightforward and you're thinking a lot less about

168
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:55,925
Speaker 2:  like, do I use Alexa or do I use HomeKit? And you're just like,

169
00:10:55,975 --> 00:10:57,245
Speaker 2:  where does the water go?

170
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:01,445
Speaker 4:  Oh, exactly. And like even on the electricity side, you have to decide are

171
00:11:01,445 --> 00:11:05,325
Speaker 4:  you gonna do a 12 volt or 48 volt system? And the pros and cons of

172
00:11:05,325 --> 00:11:09,165
Speaker 4:  that because there's weight limits. You go with the, the higher voltage and

173
00:11:09,165 --> 00:11:12,965
Speaker 4:  you can do smaller gauge wires or is it higher gauge? I never can

174
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:16,965
Speaker 4:  remember anyways, the narrower cables and as a result you have less

175
00:11:16,965 --> 00:11:20,525
Speaker 4:  weight and there's weight restrictions, at least in Europe. And so If, you

176
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:23,805
Speaker 4:  go over the weight, then suddenly you need a different kind of class of driver's

177
00:11:23,805 --> 00:11:27,325
Speaker 4:  license. So there's a lot of small things you have to consider just to get

178
00:11:27,385 --> 00:11:31,285
Speaker 4:  on the road and to then to keep everything powered. But yeah, water for

179
00:11:31,285 --> 00:11:35,005
Speaker 4:  the winter, what do you do? So it doesn't freeze. Some, some people put these

180
00:11:35,005 --> 00:11:38,965
Speaker 4:  giant water containers below their vans, or at least it's, it's,

181
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:42,925
Speaker 4:  it's in uninsulated parts of, of the van. And if it's

182
00:11:42,925 --> 00:11:45,365
Speaker 4:  not heated, it's gonna freeze and then you don't have any water when you're

183
00:11:45,365 --> 00:11:48,805
Speaker 4:  parked that. Yeah. It's just a tremendous amount you have to think about.

184
00:11:48,805 --> 00:11:52,365
Speaker 4:  But for me it's fun. It's, it's like a, it's a massive puzzle and it's a

185
00:11:52,365 --> 00:11:55,285
Speaker 4:  big learning curve, but it's all stuff. I mean it's tech, it's, it's all

186
00:11:55,285 --> 00:11:59,205
Speaker 4:  stuff i I like to do anyways. Yeah. And the amount of gadgets that

187
00:11:59,205 --> 00:12:03,165
Speaker 4:  I've uncovered through this, like I it's just a whole new playground

188
00:12:03,345 --> 00:12:04,005
Speaker 4:  to explore.

189
00:12:04,275 --> 00:12:06,565
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I wanna talk about all of those, but let's talk about power first.

190
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:10,365
Speaker 2:  You, you, I know for years have been on this like, how do I do

191
00:12:11,795 --> 00:12:15,645
Speaker 2:  battery solar power combinations in a way that

192
00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:19,285
Speaker 2:  is like relatively cheap, relatively light and as effective as

193
00:12:19,485 --> 00:12:22,245
Speaker 2:  possible. Is that a, is that, is that a good summation of, of the journey

194
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:22,565
Speaker 2:  here?

195
00:12:22,995 --> 00:12:26,365
Speaker 4:  Yeah, yeah. And and stuff that you can reuse as well. Hmm. Because If, you

196
00:12:26,365 --> 00:12:30,245
Speaker 4:  put it in one location and it's nice to be able to use it

197
00:12:30,245 --> 00:12:34,085
Speaker 4:  somewhere else. 'cause if, like, you can have a, a system installed

198
00:12:34,085 --> 00:12:37,525
Speaker 4:  in your house and wouldn't it be nice if If you disappear in your RV for

199
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:40,565
Speaker 4:  the summer that you can remove that? 'cause it's a huge investment and you

200
00:12:40,565 --> 00:12:43,925
Speaker 4:  can put it in the RV and then you can reuse it there. So power is a, is a,

201
00:12:43,925 --> 00:12:47,845
Speaker 4:  is a big thing that I believe is changing. I think there's a,

202
00:12:48,105 --> 00:12:51,565
Speaker 4:  you have these, these dedicated, well I call them solar

203
00:12:51,565 --> 00:12:55,125
Speaker 4:  generators, but anyways, they're giant batteries and they have

204
00:12:55,455 --> 00:12:59,125
Speaker 4:  solar controllers. So you can attach a system of solar

205
00:12:59,185 --> 00:13:03,165
Speaker 4:  panels onto your roof. You can do folding panels as well that you have

206
00:13:03,165 --> 00:13:06,925
Speaker 4:  out, out on the side. But it's going to collect that and manage

207
00:13:07,105 --> 00:13:10,925
Speaker 4:  the voltage properly. So it charges those batteries at the most optimum way

208
00:13:10,925 --> 00:13:14,685
Speaker 4:  that it can. But these are all self-contained batteries.

209
00:13:14,905 --> 00:13:18,605
Speaker 4:  The other route is to go with something in Van World, it's mostly from a

210
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:22,365
Speaker 4:  company called Viron Systems. And then you have, you need an electrician

211
00:13:23,065 --> 00:13:26,925
Speaker 4:  or at least that level of knowledge to figure out yeah, all

212
00:13:26,925 --> 00:13:29,725
Speaker 4:  the components that you need to hook up and all the wiring and everything

213
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:33,445
Speaker 4:  else. Now it's all self-contained in these boxes that are sold by EcoFlow

214
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,485
Speaker 4:  and Blue Eddie and a number of other companies that, I mean the,

215
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:41,165
Speaker 4:  the list is growing every day. Only problem is all these companies, all those,

216
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:45,045
Speaker 4:  some of them have us addresses that. Every one of 'em comes outta China because

217
00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:48,685
Speaker 4:  those lithium ion battery packs, that's where everything is produced

218
00:13:48,865 --> 00:13:51,565
Speaker 4:  and that's where all the solar panels are increasingly coming from.

219
00:13:52,745 --> 00:13:56,645
Speaker 4:  The nice thing about that having all this capacity and, and all

220
00:13:56,645 --> 00:14:00,565
Speaker 4:  this product is that the prices have been coming down, but now the

221
00:14:00,595 --> 00:14:04,285
Speaker 4:  tariffs are being applied on top of that. So it's, it's, it's kind of

222
00:14:04,285 --> 00:14:08,085
Speaker 4:  difficult, but at least at the moment, historically the prices are way cheaper

223
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:11,965
Speaker 4:  for batteries and solar than ever. Solar is way more efficient. So

224
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:15,085
Speaker 4:  I, instead of doing these piecemeal systems, like from the companies like

225
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:18,925
Speaker 4:  Viron systems, I think the way to go is to get these self-contained boxes.

226
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:23,045
Speaker 4:  These solar generators, you can use it at home. Like

227
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,885
Speaker 4:  EcoFlow makes a a, a balcony solar system.

228
00:14:27,985 --> 00:14:31,325
Speaker 4:  So when you're home you can have it charging and pumping energy back into

229
00:14:31,325 --> 00:14:35,285
Speaker 4:  the house. Now that's a controversial thing. It is, at

230
00:14:35,285 --> 00:14:38,925
Speaker 4:  least in most of Europe, it is considered safe within limits. Hmm.

231
00:14:39,205 --> 00:14:43,005
Speaker 4:  I think they go up to between 600 and 800 watts. That's,

232
00:14:43,005 --> 00:14:46,405
Speaker 4:  that's legal. Okay. 'cause they just plug right into your electrical

233
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:51,045
Speaker 4:  socket on in your house. Oh wow. So it seems super weird, but yeah,

234
00:14:51,915 --> 00:14:52,965
Speaker 4:  it's, that's

235
00:14:52,965 --> 00:14:54,565
Speaker 2:  A bold thing to just plug into the wall.

236
00:14:55,025 --> 00:14:58,525
Speaker 4:  It felt really bad. When I, and I asked lots and lots of questions. I talked

237
00:14:58,525 --> 00:15:01,645
Speaker 4:  to all my engineering friends and my electrician friends and they said, oh,

238
00:15:01,665 --> 00:15:05,645
Speaker 4:  it should be okay. And it's, it's approved So, I did it slowly, but

239
00:15:05,645 --> 00:15:09,485
Speaker 4:  then, but anyways, but then, you know, you can have it charging at home.

240
00:15:09,485 --> 00:15:12,725
Speaker 4:  You have that big battery. 'cause those batteries are like 50 cents to, you

241
00:15:12,725 --> 00:15:16,405
Speaker 4:  know, between 50 and 70 cents per watt hour. And they're

242
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:19,085
Speaker 4:  like, the one that I'm testing right now in the van is eight

243
00:15:20,005 --> 00:15:23,685
Speaker 4:  kilowatt hours. Wow. So that's a $5,000 battery.

244
00:15:24,505 --> 00:15:27,165
Speaker 4:  You, you don't want that just sitting idle. You wanna be able to use that

245
00:15:27,185 --> 00:15:31,085
Speaker 4:  as much as you can. So it's here in the house when,

246
00:15:31,585 --> 00:15:35,445
Speaker 4:  you know, connected to a balcony system when, you know, when I'm at home

247
00:15:35,505 --> 00:15:38,365
Speaker 4:  and then when I'm in the van, I can just wheel it outta the house. It's not

248
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:41,965
Speaker 4:  light, it's like a hundred pounds or more, but then I can put it in the van

249
00:15:41,965 --> 00:15:45,365
Speaker 4:  and continue to use it. Then If, you get one of these vicn systems, it's

250
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:49,325
Speaker 4:  just stuck in the van all the time. And yeah, that's not ideal.

251
00:15:49,705 --> 00:15:53,285
Speaker 2:  And that does seem like a good outcome actually, to have something that is

252
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,365
Speaker 2:  sort of scalable in the way that you're describing. Like, I feel like for

253
00:15:56,365 --> 00:15:59,885
Speaker 2:  you, the white whale is then to be able to take sort of one part out of that

254
00:15:59,885 --> 00:16:03,485
Speaker 2:  system and put it in a backpack for your weekend. And I feel like all of

255
00:16:03,485 --> 00:16:07,245
Speaker 2:  the stories about this stuff that I see you, you writing outta, like that's

256
00:16:07,245 --> 00:16:09,845
Speaker 2:  the one piece that's missing where you're like, they've done this thing that

257
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:13,645
Speaker 2:  I can, it can, it can heat a room, it works on electricity, it's great,

258
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:17,725
Speaker 2:  it is too damn big to carry with you anywhere. And it's like that, that is

259
00:16:17,725 --> 00:16:21,005
Speaker 2:  the one sort of magical piece of this system that still seems to be missing.

260
00:16:21,595 --> 00:16:24,365
Speaker 4:  Yeah. The, the physics of of needing giant

261
00:26:04,845 --> 00:26:08,565
Speaker 4:  I think it's, it's like 20 euro a month really. So yeah. It's,

262
00:26:08,725 --> 00:26:12,245
Speaker 4:  it's by region and you know, everybody said that, you know, it's now, now

263
00:26:12,245 --> 00:26:15,045
Speaker 4:  available in the US Those are the news, those are the headlines. But it had

264
00:26:15,045 --> 00:26:18,405
Speaker 4:  already been in South American countries. I think there were five countries

265
00:26:18,405 --> 00:26:21,445
Speaker 4:  before the US 'cause that's their primary market for the many. Right, right.

266
00:26:21,505 --> 00:26:22,685
Speaker 4:  So it's priced accordingly.

267
00:26:22,955 --> 00:26:25,765
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Okay. Alright. Two more things I wanna ask you about and then I'm gonna

268
00:26:25,765 --> 00:26:29,205
Speaker 2:  let you go here. The first is the Peak Design backpack that

269
00:26:29,665 --> 00:26:33,045
Speaker 2:  you ended. Love it. For years, like years,

270
00:26:34,015 --> 00:26:37,885
Speaker 2:  every bag nerd I knew talked about the Peak Design

271
00:26:38,065 --> 00:26:41,725
Speaker 2:  25 liter backpack. It was like just enough of a

272
00:26:41,785 --> 00:26:45,685
Speaker 2:  camera first bag that I never bought one, but I feel like

273
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:49,395
Speaker 2:  I should have. And now there's a new one. Everybody seems to love it. Yeah.

274
00:26:49,395 --> 00:26:50,835
Speaker 2:  Tell me about it. Why is this thing so great?

275
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:55,595
Speaker 4:  Oh, I, I ran, I ran into the problem of going

276
00:26:55,595 --> 00:26:58,675
Speaker 4:  back to my review from eight years ago and I called it perfect. Right?

277
00:26:59,775 --> 00:27:03,595
Speaker 4:  And eight years ago it was perfect for me. Yeah, it was perfect for my

278
00:27:03,595 --> 00:27:07,275
Speaker 4:  needs. But as we've been talking about, I like to go remote now

279
00:27:07,935 --> 00:27:11,875
Speaker 4:  and I can't carry two or three different bags with me. I need

280
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:15,835
Speaker 4:  one bag that can do everything. The Peak Design, the new bag, the old bag

281
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:19,715
Speaker 4:  is, is a camera bag. So it's heavy, it's durable.

282
00:27:20,295 --> 00:27:24,115
Speaker 4:  It has the, all the camera, the flexible inserts already built into it, right?

283
00:27:25,015 --> 00:27:28,995
Speaker 4:  The new bag, which by the way, the review unit they sent me is in

284
00:27:28,995 --> 00:27:31,955
Speaker 4:  white, Arctic white. And it looks like I'm walking through, I don't know,

285
00:27:32,055 --> 00:27:35,835
Speaker 4:  2001 a Space Odyssey. It's this sci-fi white color. It's just fantastic.

286
00:27:35,835 --> 00:27:39,635
Speaker 4:  Totally imp practical. It's pretty, yeah, it's, I would never, maybe

287
00:27:39,715 --> 00:27:43,195
Speaker 4:  I would buy it. Verin bought it, our video producer, he bought it.

288
00:27:43,715 --> 00:27:44,515
Speaker 4:  I don't know if I would

289
00:27:44,895 --> 00:27:48,795
Speaker 2:  The fact that even the company is like, eh, it's gonna turn yellow over time

290
00:27:48,895 --> 00:27:52,075
Speaker 2:  is is a real, is a real turnoff for me. I'm not gonna lie. It looks great

291
00:27:52,225 --> 00:27:54,715
Speaker 2:  when you first get it though. It looks so good. It looks

292
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:58,395
Speaker 4:  Fantastic, but, okay, so first impressions, it,

293
00:27:58,575 --> 00:28:01,755
Speaker 4:  it, it lacks that structure of the old, of the old bag. So

294
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:05,675
Speaker 4:  it took me a while to get to figure out what this thing was. 'cause it, it's

295
00:28:05,675 --> 00:28:09,395
Speaker 4:  a, it's a, it's basically a lightweight nylon bag with a laptop sleeve.

296
00:28:10,295 --> 00:28:14,275
Speaker 4:  And it's not until you delve into the ecosystem of Peak Design products

297
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:17,875
Speaker 4:  that this thing becomes really good because

298
00:28:18,705 --> 00:28:21,475
Speaker 4:  sometimes you only want that lightweight nylon bag. Like if you're going

299
00:28:21,475 --> 00:28:25,395
Speaker 4:  to the gym, you stuff some things in there. You have a maybe a day trip day

300
00:28:25,395 --> 00:28:29,195
Speaker 4:  hike, you're only bringing maybe a drone. It already has its own protective

301
00:28:29,195 --> 00:28:32,995
Speaker 4:  case. So you can use that. But if you're really a camera

302
00:28:33,065 --> 00:28:36,395
Speaker 4:  nerd or you got lots of gadgets, you got all the, maybe you're carrying a

303
00:28:36,395 --> 00:28:40,195
Speaker 4:  drone action cam and some other stuff. They have the, the

304
00:28:40,195 --> 00:28:44,115
Speaker 4:  camera insert camera cubes is what they call them. But

305
00:28:44,115 --> 00:28:47,595
Speaker 4:  that's another like the medium as they call it. It's not quite small, not

306
00:28:47,595 --> 00:28:51,395
Speaker 4:  quite medium. But the s medium and it fits perfect in the 25 liter Peak Design

307
00:28:51,395 --> 00:28:55,355
Speaker 4:  outdoor bag that is another 70 euro on top of

308
00:28:55,355 --> 00:28:58,515
Speaker 4:  the, I forget what it was, 230 something So I.

309
00:28:58,515 --> 00:29:00,275
Speaker 2:  Think it's two 50. Yeah. So

310
00:29:00,275 --> 00:29:03,795
Speaker 4:  You're already up to 300 and then If, you start adding a couple more accessories.

311
00:29:03,795 --> 00:29:07,675
Speaker 4:  You could easily push this thing up to 400 euro. So it's not cheap. But

312
00:29:07,975 --> 00:29:09,475
Speaker 4:  camera bags are not cheap.

313
00:29:09,955 --> 00:29:13,715
Speaker 2:  I was gonna say it's the, in the scheme of really good camera bags, that's

314
00:29:13,715 --> 00:29:16,755
Speaker 2:  like upper middle class I've seen much crazier

315
00:29:16,825 --> 00:29:20,115
Speaker 4:  Exactly. Prices. And they do have a lifetime warranty. So if anything breaks,

316
00:29:20,215 --> 00:29:22,995
Speaker 4:  any of the straps, any of those things, the yellow wing is not covered. If,

317
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:25,555
Speaker 4:  you get the white one. Unfortunately it comes in black and some kind of purplish

318
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:29,475
Speaker 4:  color. But using it for God, I had it

319
00:29:29,475 --> 00:29:32,835
Speaker 4:  for two months 'cause there was some complications of receiving it and whatnot.

320
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:36,475
Speaker 4:  And I also wanted to wait before posting it until it got off the Kickstarter

321
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:39,395
Speaker 4:  campaign. 'cause I hate sending people to Kickstarter for a purchase fair.

322
00:29:40,295 --> 00:29:43,645
Speaker 4:  But the day that it went live on, on the Peak Design website is when we posted

323
00:29:43,845 --> 00:29:47,495
Speaker 4:  a review and I had been using it for, I don't know,

324
00:29:47,645 --> 00:29:51,495
Speaker 4:  yeah. Two months at that point. And I absolutely love it.

325
00:29:52,095 --> 00:29:54,855
Speaker 4:  Absolutely love it. So I feel really bad about like,

326
00:29:56,015 --> 00:29:59,695
Speaker 4:  like I, I can't pull the trigger myself 'cause I feel like I'm betraying

327
00:30:00,435 --> 00:30:04,415
Speaker 4:  my old Peak Design bag that I bought. So I, I, I put

328
00:30:04,415 --> 00:30:07,935
Speaker 4:  it on my Christmas list and then I'll let hopefully my wife do it for me.

329
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:12,335
Speaker 2:  That's fair. So the the modular thing is the thing I was most torn on

330
00:30:12,335 --> 00:30:15,655
Speaker 2:  reading your review. 'cause on the one hand, the thing you're describing

331
00:30:16,405 --> 00:30:19,015
Speaker 2:  sort of makes sense, right? You can, it can be a bunch of different things

332
00:30:19,015 --> 00:30:22,855
Speaker 2:  depending on what you need. On the other hand, that just sounds like a lot

333
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:26,695
Speaker 2:  of work. And I feel like what, what I don't wanna do is like manage my

334
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:30,655
Speaker 2:  cargo day in and day out. Like the, the thing I have loved about bags that

335
00:30:30,655 --> 00:30:34,535
Speaker 2:  I've had is the ones that I find that on purpose or by accident just

336
00:30:34,605 --> 00:30:38,095
Speaker 2:  already have the pouches for everything I need. Where they're like, oh David,

337
00:30:38,115 --> 00:30:41,175
Speaker 2:  do you need a place to put your gross sneakers? Here's a place that we made

338
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:44,815
Speaker 2:  for you. Like, those are the things that I love and I can see the appeal

339
00:30:44,815 --> 00:30:47,295
Speaker 2:  of sort of building that yourself, but it also just feels like it might be

340
00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:51,135
Speaker 2:  a lot of work. And like you said, a lot of additional things to buy on top

341
00:30:51,135 --> 00:30:52,335
Speaker 2:  of the expensive thing that I've already bought.

342
00:30:53,005 --> 00:30:56,855
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I I mean that's a good point. But I, what I, what I settled

343
00:30:56,955 --> 00:31:00,575
Speaker 4:  on is like, I don't always need all my camera stuff. I don't need my, all

344
00:31:00,575 --> 00:31:03,655
Speaker 4:  my drones. So if I can have a

345
00:31:04,165 --> 00:31:07,615
Speaker 4:  container for that, a soft shell container put everything in, it's already

346
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:11,375
Speaker 4:  organized for me. And I just remove that in and out. And I always know where

347
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:14,335
Speaker 4:  all my tech gear and this is really important when you're in a van 'cause

348
00:31:14,675 --> 00:31:17,735
Speaker 4:  you have to know where all that stuff is. Yeah. So for me, I can just take

349
00:31:17,735 --> 00:31:21,455
Speaker 4:  that cube out, I can put it aside, I then take the bag and I can just load

350
00:31:21,455 --> 00:31:25,375
Speaker 4:  it up with, with all my day hiking material. Or I can put it back

351
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:28,615
Speaker 4:  in if I'm doing a, like a VERGE review or something, I'll put that in with

352
00:31:28,615 --> 00:31:32,335
Speaker 4:  all my other stuff. So for me that modularity was, was a key selling

353
00:31:32,335 --> 00:31:33,375
Speaker 4:  point. So

354
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:36,695
Speaker 2:  You you think of it like the, the camera lives in the cube all the time.

355
00:31:36,845 --> 00:31:39,655
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And then you just sort of stack whatever cubes you need for that day

356
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:40,295
Speaker 2:  into the bag.

357
00:31:40,295 --> 00:31:43,335
Speaker 4:  Exactly. And you can get multiple cubes. It actually fits two different cubes.

358
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:46,895
Speaker 4:  And they also have soft shell bags that you can store

359
00:31:47,085 --> 00:31:51,015
Speaker 4:  gear in If, you want If you wanna do that. But again, If you, if

360
00:31:51,135 --> 00:31:54,255
Speaker 4:  you're, yeah, if you're, if you're living in a van, you want to, everything

361
00:31:54,255 --> 00:31:57,895
Speaker 4:  is kind of modular anyway. So fair. It's a, it's a, it's a nice

362
00:31:57,895 --> 00:32:01,845
Speaker 4:  extension for the bag. Okay. But for, for my needs, this is now a

363
00:32:01,845 --> 00:32:05,125
Speaker 4:  better bag. I felt bad calling it perfect. 'cause it's, I've got a lot of,

364
00:32:05,745 --> 00:32:08,645
Speaker 4:  I'm always gonna have lots of complaints. Like I, the the drawstring that

365
00:32:08,645 --> 00:32:12,165
Speaker 4:  that pulls the top pouch closed is, I think it's a bit inelegant.

366
00:32:12,605 --> 00:32:15,205
Speaker 4:  The cord get in the way when you're pulling a jacket in and out or whatever.

367
00:32:15,205 --> 00:32:18,205
Speaker 4:  But you know, you're looking for perfection when you're spending 300 euro

368
00:32:18,345 --> 00:32:19,685
Speaker 4:  or $300 on a bag.

369
00:32:19,915 --> 00:32:23,845
Speaker 2:  Totally. Yeah. That's fair. All right. And you, you mentioned the last

370
00:32:23,845 --> 00:32:25,765
Speaker 2:  thing I wanna talk about, which is that you've become a drone guy.

371
00:32:27,675 --> 00:32:31,435
Speaker 4:  I am not a drone guy. I am a selfie drone guy. Oh,

372
00:32:31,755 --> 00:32:32,355
Speaker 2:  Interesting. Okay.

373
00:32:32,995 --> 00:32:36,955
Speaker 4:  I tried drones in the past and I, nobody seems to talk about how bad

374
00:32:37,295 --> 00:32:41,165
Speaker 4:  DJI software is. I think it's atrocious. I think the user experience is

375
00:32:41,195 --> 00:32:45,005
Speaker 4:  just terrible. But drone people have been living with these drones

376
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,365
Speaker 4:  for a long time. They understand how the software works.

377
00:32:47,805 --> 00:32:50,405
Speaker 2:  I think it's like Photoshop now where it's like If, you don't, if you've

378
00:32:50,405 --> 00:32:54,005
Speaker 2:  never seen it before, it is literally borderline

379
00:32:54,085 --> 00:32:57,205
Speaker 2:  unusable. But there are people now who have spent a long time

380
00:32:57,705 --> 00:33:01,085
Speaker 2:  trying to figure it out. But also, one of my theories is that DJI figured

381
00:33:01,085 --> 00:33:05,045
Speaker 2:  out a long time ago that it was easier to teach the drones to fly themselves

382
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:08,965
Speaker 2:  than it was to make better software. So they've just done that. So they're

383
00:33:08,965 --> 00:33:11,045
Speaker 2:  like, their hope is that you just don't even have to use the app because

384
00:33:11,045 --> 00:33:12,525
Speaker 2:  the drone is fine. Don't even worry about it,

385
00:33:12,985 --> 00:33:16,885
Speaker 4:  Man. I mean, that's the thing. So I, I went, I did a bike packing trick

386
00:33:17,035 --> 00:33:21,005
Speaker 4:  trip this summer with a friend of mine and you know, I don't want to, I see

387
00:33:21,105 --> 00:33:23,965
Speaker 4:  DC rainmaker and people, they've got the controller mounted on their handlebars

388
00:33:23,965 --> 00:33:26,125
Speaker 4:  and they're, you know, they're, they're talking to, they're doing all this

389
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:29,005
Speaker 4:  stuff all the time. But he's, he's been doing this stuff for, I don't know,

390
00:33:29,045 --> 00:33:29,325
Speaker 4:  a decade.

391
00:33:31,005 --> 00:33:34,685
Speaker 4:  I just want something super simple. I push a button, set it up to fly and

392
00:33:34,685 --> 00:33:38,565
Speaker 4:  then it'll fill me. Right. And this also works for gadgets. Like if I have

393
00:33:38,565 --> 00:33:41,845
Speaker 4:  to do a backpack, some of my backpack photos are, are taken by drones. 'cause

394
00:33:41,945 --> 00:33:45,405
Speaker 4:  you know, I can either ask my wife to do it. She does, she's not a huge fan

395
00:33:45,405 --> 00:33:48,765
Speaker 4:  of that. Or a friend or I just do it myself and I'd rather just be

396
00:33:48,765 --> 00:33:52,325
Speaker 4:  self-sufficient and do it, do it myself. But no

397
00:33:52,325 --> 00:33:56,165
Speaker 4:  controller required it just select between one of six modes. If I want to,

398
00:33:56,205 --> 00:33:59,445
Speaker 4:  I can tweak it in the, in the, in the app. But it's very rare that I have

399
00:33:59,445 --> 00:34:03,285
Speaker 4:  to do that. And now we have two of these really great selfie drones.

400
00:34:03,285 --> 00:34:06,125
Speaker 4:  There's the, the original Hover air, I guess it's not even the original,

401
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:10,045
Speaker 4:  it's like second generation hover air X one. They just came out with two

402
00:34:10,105 --> 00:34:13,765
Speaker 4:  new ones. Maxim Pro, I think they are, but now they're really expensive.

403
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:15,845
Speaker 4:  The nice thing about the old ones, I think they were

404
00:34:15,985 --> 00:34:19,925
Speaker 4:  2 99, 3 9, 3 49 or something, depending

405
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:23,805
Speaker 4:  upon the sales. But this DJI neo that just came out now, it

406
00:34:23,805 --> 00:34:26,205
Speaker 4:  was a little undercooked when they launched it. Like you couldn't do vertical

407
00:34:26,205 --> 00:34:28,965
Speaker 4:  video. It wasn't fast enough to chase you on a bike, for example.

408
00:34:30,545 --> 00:34:33,845
Speaker 4:  But they've recently, just in the two or three months since it launched,

409
00:34:33,845 --> 00:34:37,565
Speaker 4:  they've already updated the firmware to do all those things and it only

410
00:34:37,565 --> 00:34:41,445
Speaker 4:  costs $199, which is insane. And

411
00:34:41,445 --> 00:34:44,725
Speaker 4:  you can buy a controller If you want and you can buy goggles, If, you wanna

412
00:34:44,725 --> 00:34:48,405
Speaker 4:  do, what is it first FPV, first person viewing?

413
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:52,485
Speaker 4:  I don't know what that's called. I, I don't care about that. I have no interest

414
00:34:52,485 --> 00:34:55,845
Speaker 4:  in doing that. I just want something that's going to, you know, follow me,

415
00:34:56,155 --> 00:35:00,125
Speaker 4:  take pictures, upload it to Instagram or whatever, you know, maybe I'm gonna

416
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:03,925
Speaker 4:  have a vanlife influencer account at some point, who knows? But it's just

417
00:35:03,995 --> 00:35:07,885
Speaker 4:  dumb. It's so dumb. It's so easy. It just makes me love it. But

418
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:10,685
Speaker 4:  as soon as you, I have to use a controller, I'm out. I'm done.

419
00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:15,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I have landed in the same place and I actually, I sort of turned

420
00:35:15,185 --> 00:35:19,005
Speaker 2:  out of drones for a long time because it was just more complicated

421
00:35:19,005 --> 00:35:22,685
Speaker 2:  than it was fun for me. And it was like, I didn't have a purpose for it.

422
00:35:22,965 --> 00:35:26,805
Speaker 2:  I even, even the photography of it was just purely sort of fun.

423
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:29,765
Speaker 2:  I wasn't doing anything with any of it. And it got to the point where I was

424
00:35:29,765 --> 00:35:33,645
Speaker 2:  like, this is so fiddly. And so yeah, just annoying that

425
00:35:33,645 --> 00:35:36,725
Speaker 2:  even the fun stuff I get out of it is not, the juice is not worth the squeeze,

426
00:35:36,745 --> 00:35:39,965
Speaker 2:  you know, know. And then, yeah, this is why I'm so interested in the neo,

427
00:35:39,965 --> 00:35:43,805
Speaker 2:  because like you said, $200 and does a bunch of

428
00:35:43,805 --> 00:35:47,685
Speaker 2:  cool stuff without any worries or requiring

429
00:35:47,685 --> 00:35:51,325
Speaker 2:  any work on your part. That to me is like when drones start to get really

430
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:52,165
Speaker 2:  interesting. Yeah,

431
00:35:52,565 --> 00:35:56,125
Speaker 4:  I do worry. I think, I think the headline on the, on the news article was

432
00:35:56,835 --> 00:36:00,565
Speaker 4:  basically, oh God, these things are gonna be everywhere. I do think that

433
00:36:00,635 --> 00:36:04,235
Speaker 4:  there's this, there's this risk that we're just gonna

434
00:36:04,345 --> 00:36:07,515
Speaker 4:  pollute national parks and whatever with these selfie drones and they are

435
00:36:07,515 --> 00:36:09,875
Speaker 4:  noisy, right? Yeah. You can't get away from it and they're gonna bump into

436
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:13,595
Speaker 4:  people If, you pass somebody on a trail, like I've, I've come close to passing

437
00:36:13,915 --> 00:36:17,315
Speaker 4:  somebody on a trail on a bike. I had to stop, pull over, but then the drones

438
00:36:17,315 --> 00:36:19,955
Speaker 4:  just hovering there right above the, right, above the trail. And I had to

439
00:36:19,955 --> 00:36:23,475
Speaker 4:  run over and grab it and flip it over. And I'm just one guy at the beginning.

440
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:27,595
Speaker 4:  But what's gonna happen when after Christmas, you know,

441
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:31,555
Speaker 4:  everybody's got a 1 99 Neo and they're flooding

442
00:36:31,615 --> 00:36:35,435
Speaker 4:  the parks and the ski slopes and whatever, and there this weird gray area

443
00:36:35,435 --> 00:36:39,075
Speaker 4:  of regulation, they're probably illegal, but it doesn't

444
00:36:39,145 --> 00:36:42,875
Speaker 4:  feel like it's illegal. Like I'm not do, I'm just pushing a button. I set

445
00:36:42,915 --> 00:36:46,275
Speaker 4:  a lt, right. It doesn't feel like a huge risk, but, and then yeah, I mean

446
00:36:46,275 --> 00:36:48,675
Speaker 4:  you, well in Europe it's complicated as you're traveling between countries.

447
00:36:48,675 --> 00:36:51,555
Speaker 4:  Do you, do I have to register or do I not? But

448
00:36:52,385 --> 00:36:55,755
Speaker 4:  yeah, it's sometimes though the technology comes along before the regulation

449
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:59,515
Speaker 4:  is ready and then this is definitely gonna be one of those cases. I I, yeah.

450
00:36:59,515 --> 00:36:59,755
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

451
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:03,755
Speaker 2:  And it is, it is both more and less complicated than like the bigger

452
00:37:03,815 --> 00:37:07,745
Speaker 2:  drones that you can fly further, right? Where like those, we should

453
00:37:07,745 --> 00:37:11,305
Speaker 2:  have lots of rules about those, right? Like I can fly this drone

454
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:15,305
Speaker 2:  theoretically miles away from me. Like yet we should have lots of rules about

455
00:37:15,305 --> 00:37:18,825
Speaker 2:  those drones. But this thing that is just circling my head as I go on a bike

456
00:37:18,825 --> 00:37:22,745
Speaker 2:  path, you're right. It doesn't feel, that just feels like a thing that I

457
00:37:22,745 --> 00:37:24,945
Speaker 2:  have that doesn't feel like a thing anyone else even needs to be worried

458
00:37:24,945 --> 00:37:28,905
Speaker 2:  about. But you add one of those to every person you see on the path.

459
00:37:28,975 --> 00:37:32,225
Speaker 2:  Okay. And suddenly we have a whole new set of problems and it I do agree,

460
00:37:32,225 --> 00:37:33,145
Speaker 2:  it does feel like that's coming.

461
00:37:33,535 --> 00:37:36,945
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And they do go fast. Now the once, now that the neo

462
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,825
Speaker 4:  software has been updated, it'll go like 32 kilometers per hour. I think

463
00:37:40,935 --> 00:37:43,625
Speaker 4:  that is in, that's like over 20 miles per hour I believe.

464
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:44,825
Speaker 2:  That's like fast for sure.

465
00:37:45,495 --> 00:37:48,945
Speaker 4:  Yeah. And if that's following you and slams into somebody that, that you're

466
00:37:48,945 --> 00:37:51,705
Speaker 4:  passing, that is a collision that's gonna hurt. Even though the props are

467
00:37:51,705 --> 00:37:55,545
Speaker 4:  covered with guards, it's, it's gonna hurt. Yeah. So yeah, there's a, there's

468
00:37:55,545 --> 00:37:55,985
Speaker 4:  a risk here.

469
00:37:56,335 --> 00:37:59,105
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Fair enough. All right, well I should let you go, but once you've,

470
00:37:59,105 --> 00:38:02,665
Speaker 2:  once you've done this winter tour with the sprinter, you gotta, you gotta

471
00:38:02,665 --> 00:38:04,625
Speaker 2:  come back and give us a, give us a sprinter review.

472
00:38:05,085 --> 00:38:07,025
Speaker 4:  Got, if I survive, I absolutely will.

473
00:38:07,075 --> 00:38:10,105
Speaker 2:  Maybe we'll do it from the top of a ski slope and you can just, you can just

474
00:38:10,105 --> 00:38:12,945
Speaker 2:  write off that whole trip as a work expense. It'll be amazing. I'll

475
00:38:12,945 --> 00:38:15,385
Speaker 4:  Have a starlink mini and a backpack and the drone hovering

476
00:39:14,575 --> 00:39:17,515
Speaker 2:  now that you don't even really notice them, even though it's like a giant

477
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:21,955
Speaker 2:  square plastic brick on someone's chest as they talk to you. But

478
00:39:21,955 --> 00:39:24,875
Speaker 2:  these things are also really useful. We use them for VERGE cast things all

479
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:27,595
Speaker 2:  the time. We use them for our video team all the time. So Andrew put all

480
00:39:27,595 --> 00:39:31,075
Speaker 2:  these to the test and I figured now would be a good time to have him come

481
00:39:31,075 --> 00:39:34,995
Speaker 2:  on and both play a little bit for us and we can see how it all sounds

482
00:39:35,495 --> 00:39:38,835
Speaker 2:  and decide which one of these is actually worth, you know,

483
00:39:39,475 --> 00:39:43,195
Speaker 2:  sticking onto your chest when you two are making videos. Let's get into it.

484
00:39:43,195 --> 00:39:44,835
Speaker 2:  Andrew Marino, welcome back to the show.

485
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:45,595
Speaker 6:  Hey David,

486
00:39:45,945 --> 00:39:48,755
Speaker 2:  It's been a minute. It's nice to have you back on the first cast. Yeah, what's

487
00:39:48,915 --> 00:39:49,035
Speaker 6:  Up?

488
00:39:49,535 --> 00:39:53,515
Speaker 2:  You left us rudely to go make videos about microphones

489
00:39:53,535 --> 00:39:56,875
Speaker 2:  and now I've brought you back because this is what happens to you. You can't

490
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:57,475
Speaker 2:  avoid us forever.

491
00:39:58,105 --> 00:39:58,875
Speaker 6:  It's a full circle.

492
00:39:59,225 --> 00:40:02,995
Speaker 2:  Exactly. So, okay, I realized in just recording the

493
00:40:02,995 --> 00:40:06,835
Speaker 2:  intro for this that I don't even know what to call this like class of

494
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:10,275
Speaker 2:  microphones that you've been testing here. So like what, what are these things?

495
00:40:10,295 --> 00:40:11,435
Speaker 2:  How do you think about these mics?

496
00:40:11,945 --> 00:40:15,835
Speaker 6:  Yeah, they're like wireless microphone systems for your phone. It's like

497
00:40:16,235 --> 00:40:19,955
Speaker 6:  consumer grade wireless microphone systems. That's pretty good. We've had

498
00:40:20,155 --> 00:40:24,035
Speaker 6:  wireless microphone systems and broadcasting and video production now

499
00:40:24,035 --> 00:40:27,755
Speaker 6:  it's a lot easier. Just use it plugging into your phone or your, whatever

500
00:40:27,755 --> 00:40:28,915
Speaker 6:  your little computers are.

501
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:32,955
Speaker 2:  Okay. Do you remember years ago when I think it was sure made that thing

502
00:40:32,955 --> 00:40:36,035
Speaker 2:  that actually plugged into the lightning port and had that little like flippy

503
00:40:36,035 --> 00:40:39,195
Speaker 2:  microphone Yes. That you could, I loved that thing. I used that thing every

504
00:40:39,215 --> 00:40:39,795
Speaker 2:  day. I

505
00:40:39,795 --> 00:40:40,275
Speaker 6:  Still have it.

506
00:40:40,345 --> 00:40:41,515
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I still have it here. Yeah,

507
00:40:41,515 --> 00:40:43,395
Speaker 6:  I love it. It sounded great. Yeah, it really

508
00:40:43,395 --> 00:40:46,755
Speaker 2:  Did. And it was like as a, as a like voice memo thing. It was, it was great.

509
00:40:46,835 --> 00:40:50,795
Speaker 2:  I remember I did a thing with NPR one time on the phone and they

510
00:40:50,795 --> 00:40:53,715
Speaker 2:  were so excited about how good I sounded and I was like, it was like the

511
00:40:53,715 --> 00:40:57,475
Speaker 2:  great reveal of my life that I got to tell a public radio producer that I

512
00:40:57,475 --> 00:41:01,315
Speaker 2:  was on this incredible Sure microphone. But anyway, so what I

513
00:41:01,335 --> 00:41:05,075
Speaker 2:  see these microphones mostly used for is like social

514
00:41:05,365 --> 00:41:09,235
Speaker 2:  clips, right? These are like the, the like little plastic squares you

515
00:41:09,235 --> 00:41:13,115
Speaker 2:  see on everyone's shirt and sweater and hat all over social. Is that the

516
00:41:13,115 --> 00:41:14,275
Speaker 2:  main use case for these?

517
00:41:14,585 --> 00:41:17,835
Speaker 6:  Yeah, totally. Like we wouldn't, these companies wouldn't be making all these

518
00:41:17,835 --> 00:41:20,155
Speaker 6:  if it weren't for TikTok and Instagram and all that

519
00:41:20,535 --> 00:41:24,475
Speaker 2:  And they've gotten better pretty fast it seems

520
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:25,595
Speaker 2:  to me. Yes.

521
00:41:26,105 --> 00:41:29,995
Speaker 6:  With even just within the year these companies like Road and DJI

522
00:41:29,995 --> 00:41:33,445
Speaker 6:  are just upgrading these models to be lighter

523
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:37,365
Speaker 6:  or like have more features, have better charging cases.

524
00:41:38,635 --> 00:41:42,285
Speaker 6:  It's all very exciting. Like this past two years of, of audio

525
00:41:42,675 --> 00:41:43,165
Speaker 6:  devices.

526
00:41:43,635 --> 00:41:46,165
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's cool. So yeah, what is kind of the state of the art right now?

527
00:41:46,165 --> 00:41:49,645
Speaker 2:  Like you, you got five or six of them in, what do they have in common? Like

528
00:41:49,645 --> 00:41:51,165
Speaker 2:  what's the good stuff you can get now?

529
00:41:51,715 --> 00:41:55,085
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so the big ones are like, these are coming in like

530
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:59,605
Speaker 6:  AirPod cases. Basically. You have these little transmitters that

531
00:41:59,605 --> 00:42:03,565
Speaker 6:  have mics on them, you pop 'em in a little case and then

532
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:07,205
Speaker 6:  you have a little receiver that you pop right into your phone. So

533
00:42:07,435 --> 00:42:10,965
Speaker 6:  Road just came out with a road wireless micro

534
00:42:11,675 --> 00:42:15,285
Speaker 6:  that is just a, it's like a little bigger than an AirPods case and it plugs

535
00:42:15,285 --> 00:42:19,045
Speaker 6:  right into your phone. I really like that one. Sure. Also makes one,

536
00:42:19,045 --> 00:42:22,845
Speaker 6:  that's a little case that you can just pair via Bluetooth to your

537
00:42:22,845 --> 00:42:26,605
Speaker 6:  phone. And DGI of course has the

538
00:42:27,065 --> 00:42:30,925
Speaker 6:  MIC two and the MIC mini, which are these little

539
00:42:30,955 --> 00:42:34,845
Speaker 6:  microphones that you can plug into basically anything. So it's all

540
00:42:34,845 --> 00:42:38,605
Speaker 6:  like very versatile and pretty well

541
00:42:38,675 --> 00:42:42,645
Speaker 6:  made versus what we are having to deal with before with

542
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:43,725
Speaker 6:  Bluetooth headphones and stuff.

543
00:42:43,955 --> 00:42:47,765
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I mean I, I have a set here that is like a, a

544
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:51,725
Speaker 2:  thing that plugs into a headphone jack that my phone doesn't have anymore

545
00:42:52,265 --> 00:42:55,845
Speaker 2:  and then a, a whole receiver and it's like, there's like four

546
00:42:55,945 --> 00:42:59,325
Speaker 2:  cables associated with it. It's just a bad time. It sounds good, but it is

547
00:42:59,435 --> 00:43:02,885
Speaker 2:  like I had to carry a bag of gear just to get this thing right.

548
00:43:03,195 --> 00:43:07,085
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's a lot, it was a lot clunkier before and it's getting more

549
00:43:07,305 --> 00:43:11,205
Speaker 6:  easier to just like not have to tie a rubber band around your phone

550
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:14,165
Speaker 6:  to keep all this gear attached to your stuff.

551
00:43:14,635 --> 00:43:17,805
Speaker 2:  What about on the phone side? Are, do these all have like companion apps

552
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:22,045
Speaker 2:  or are they just supposed to be better microphones? I've always been torn

553
00:43:22,045 --> 00:43:24,845
Speaker 2:  about like do I want a bunch of fancy features or do I just want this thing

554
00:43:24,845 --> 00:43:28,765
Speaker 2:  to pretend to be my microphone on my phone and just

555
00:43:28,765 --> 00:43:29,285
Speaker 2:  sound better?

556
00:43:29,945 --> 00:43:33,765
Speaker 6:  Yes. This is where the differences come in here. DGI

557
00:43:33,825 --> 00:43:37,725
Speaker 6:  has all their wireless microphones. You can

558
00:43:37,745 --> 00:43:41,645
Speaker 6:  do a lot of the customization like gain and, and turning

559
00:43:41,705 --> 00:43:45,445
Speaker 6:  on noise cancellation through just the

560
00:43:45,805 --> 00:43:49,525
Speaker 6:  hardware receiver road, their little

561
00:43:49,735 --> 00:43:53,565
Speaker 6:  micro wireless microphone. You can only control the gain

562
00:43:53,565 --> 00:43:57,485
Speaker 6:  and all that stuff through the app. They also have like a

563
00:43:57,485 --> 00:44:01,245
Speaker 6:  video app that they want you to use when you're making

564
00:44:01,245 --> 00:44:04,965
Speaker 6:  video with these things. The video doesn't look as good as the

565
00:44:04,965 --> 00:44:08,645
Speaker 6:  native iPhone app when I was trying it, which was

566
00:44:08,645 --> 00:44:09,165
Speaker 6:  concerning.

567
00:44:09,195 --> 00:44:12,845
Speaker 2:  That also just seems instinctively kind of weird. The idea that I'm gonna

568
00:44:12,845 --> 00:44:16,605
Speaker 2:  make videos in an app based on which microphone I'm using

569
00:44:16,635 --> 00:44:20,525
Speaker 2:  just feels like the wrong order of operations of how I'm going to

570
00:44:20,525 --> 00:44:20,885
Speaker 2:  do stuff.

571
00:44:21,035 --> 00:44:24,885
Speaker 6:  Totally. And if also if you're making this stuff within these video

572
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:28,925
Speaker 6:  creation apps like TikTok and Instagram, like you don't want to

573
00:44:29,425 --> 00:44:32,410
Speaker 6:  go back and forth between apps to like, like adjust the gain and all that,

574
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:35,205
Speaker 2:  You know? Yeah, yeah. The thing you described about having some of the controls

575
00:44:35,345 --> 00:44:39,005
Speaker 2:  on the case itself feels like the right one, right?

576
00:44:39,995 --> 00:44:43,485
Speaker 6:  Yeah. If the receiver that you just plug in the bottom of your phone, you

577
00:44:43,485 --> 00:44:47,085
Speaker 6:  can adjust the gain on this little knob on the DJI mic mini. And

578
00:44:47,265 --> 00:44:51,205
Speaker 6:  so when you're recording, say within the TikTok app, you can adjust the game

579
00:44:51,205 --> 00:44:53,085
Speaker 6:  from there and you don't have to switch apps or anything like that.

580
00:44:53,435 --> 00:44:57,405
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that is really handy. So let's just, let's just cut right to the chase

581
00:44:57,405 --> 00:45:01,325
Speaker 2:  here. Which one's the best? You've tested them all, everybody expected

582
00:45:01,345 --> 00:45:04,165
Speaker 2:  you to not pick one in the video. This is, this is my favorite thing about

583
00:45:04,165 --> 00:45:08,125
Speaker 2:  the video you made is you just ruthlessly trolled everyone on the

584
00:45:08,365 --> 00:45:10,925
Speaker 2:  internet who refuses to just pick winners who won.

585
00:45:11,425 --> 00:45:14,885
Speaker 6:  Yes. So when we factor in price and audio quality and

586
00:45:15,365 --> 00:45:15,765
Speaker 6:  functionality,

587
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:21,045
Speaker 6:  state that there, I went with the DGI, Mike Mini, which

588
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:25,325
Speaker 6:  has this nice carrying case and the mics are

589
00:45:25,325 --> 00:45:29,205
Speaker 6:  really tiny now. So when you clip 'em on your shirt, they're

590
00:45:29,205 --> 00:45:33,085
Speaker 6:  not as noticeable as those big squares you notice on, on all these

591
00:45:33,085 --> 00:45:36,685
Speaker 6:  videos. So, I really like that, the compactness and

592
00:45:37,185 --> 00:45:40,965
Speaker 6:  it is $170, which is, you know,

593
00:45:41,725 --> 00:45:45,405
Speaker 6:  compared to a lot of these they go up to in 350 range. Yeah,

594
00:45:46,045 --> 00:45:49,245
Speaker 6:  I think sure is. The whole package is $500.

595
00:45:50,025 --> 00:45:53,645
Speaker 6:  So price, audio quality and functionality like

596
00:45:54,265 --> 00:45:55,725
Speaker 6:  DJI, mc, Minney was really impressive.

597
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:59,445
Speaker 2:  How small is it, like you, you, you've mentioned, you mentioned that it's

598
00:45:59,445 --> 00:46:03,365
Speaker 2:  small, it's, that matters more to me than I expected.

599
00:46:03,545 --> 00:46:07,325
Speaker 2:  Having now used these a lot, I notice every

600
00:46:07,435 --> 00:46:10,965
Speaker 2:  like percentage of an ounce 'cause it just, it just like pulls on your shirt

601
00:46:11,225 --> 00:46:15,125
Speaker 2:  and they, they seem huge. Like how small are we talking that

602
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:15,965
Speaker 2:  this thing has actually gotten?

603
00:46:16,945 --> 00:46:20,885
Speaker 6:  Yes. So it's about half the size as they were before. And

604
00:46:21,105 --> 00:46:25,005
Speaker 6:  the thing also is like a lot of these you could just tuck underneath

605
00:46:25,005 --> 00:46:28,725
Speaker 6:  your shirt and then use the magnet without a clip to just

606
00:46:29,715 --> 00:46:33,605
Speaker 6:  hold onto your shirt that way. I never really liked doing that because you,

607
00:46:33,605 --> 00:46:36,765
Speaker 6:  you have to deal with rust, your clothes rustling and all that. And it gets

608
00:46:36,765 --> 00:46:39,805
Speaker 6:  a little muffled. So, I always like keeping them outside of the clothes,

609
00:46:39,835 --> 00:46:43,605
Speaker 6:  like in the open air. So, which is why I don't

610
00:46:43,605 --> 00:46:47,365
Speaker 6:  usually like the bigger ones. Right. I usually would like to prefer

611
00:46:47,425 --> 00:46:51,405
Speaker 6:  to plug in a external wireless lavalier. Sometimes that

612
00:46:51,405 --> 00:46:55,365
Speaker 6:  gets a little annoying. We did a whole video shoot in, we went from

613
00:46:55,365 --> 00:46:59,325
Speaker 6:  San Francisco to LA in our hydrogen car if VERGE listeners

614
00:46:59,465 --> 00:47:03,325
Speaker 6:  may remember, we talked to a lot of car drivers that

615
00:47:03,325 --> 00:47:06,965
Speaker 6:  were like going in to pump their gas and we wanted to talk to them really

616
00:47:06,965 --> 00:47:10,765
Speaker 6:  quickly. And I just wanted like, here put, I need to put this on your shirt

617
00:47:10,765 --> 00:47:14,725
Speaker 6:  really quickly. And like a lot of If, you look at the video, a lot of them

618
00:47:14,725 --> 00:47:18,565
Speaker 6:  have these big chunky squares on their shirt. And now that the

619
00:47:18,565 --> 00:47:22,525
Speaker 6:  DJI ones are a lot smaller, it's less noticeable. You know,

620
00:47:22,525 --> 00:47:25,005
Speaker 6:  it's just a little, it's not distracting in the video.

621
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:29,165
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And it is, I will say all a huge improvement over what it

622
00:47:29,165 --> 00:47:32,845
Speaker 2:  was before, which is snaking a a wire up,

623
00:47:32,995 --> 00:47:36,725
Speaker 2:  someone's back and yeah, you as the producer having to say, sorry, I just

624
00:47:36,725 --> 00:47:40,285
Speaker 2:  have to reach up your shirt for a second here and I'm gonna touch your butt

625
00:47:40,285 --> 00:47:44,125
Speaker 2:  while I clip this thing to it. And it is very good that we,

626
00:47:44,145 --> 00:47:45,565
Speaker 2:  we seem to be leaving those days behind.

627
00:47:45,945 --> 00:47:49,765
Speaker 6:  Yes, I have done that in a traditional broadcast setting

628
00:47:49,945 --> 00:47:52,085
Speaker 6:  and it is very awkward experience.

629
00:47:52,365 --> 00:47:56,085
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It's not a good time. So you, you mentioned that

630
00:47:56,225 --> 00:47:59,925
Speaker 2:  the, the DJI is kind of the best combination of things. Are there,

631
00:48:00,435 --> 00:48:04,205
Speaker 2:  does it have competitors that beat it in one way or another? Like if all

632
00:48:04,245 --> 00:48:08,125
Speaker 2:  I care about is pure, raw best sound, don't care. What else? Is it

633
00:48:08,325 --> 00:48:09,525
Speaker 2:  somebody other than DJI who wins?

634
00:48:09,785 --> 00:48:13,525
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah. Okay. I would like to just mention now I'm currently

635
00:48:13,525 --> 00:48:17,245
Speaker 6:  recording with the DJI Mike Mini for this whole

636
00:48:17,245 --> 00:48:20,765
Speaker 6:  recording. Okay. So the one that I really like,

637
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:24,925
Speaker 6:  and it's a company that is known for its audio quality is Sennheiser.

638
00:48:26,795 --> 00:48:29,485
Speaker 6:  They just came out with this thing called the Profile Wireless.

639
00:48:30,675 --> 00:48:33,645
Speaker 6:  It's, it is just a big like stick

640
00:48:34,415 --> 00:48:38,405
Speaker 6:  audio thing, but you can just press this little, there's a little

641
00:48:38,405 --> 00:48:42,325
Speaker 6:  button. It has all these little receivers in

642
00:48:42,325 --> 00:48:44,965
Speaker 6:  here that you could just clip on. Oh,

643
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:49,085
Speaker 2:  Clever. So the, the thing you're holding looks like a sort of

644
00:48:49,185 --> 00:48:53,165
Speaker 2:  chunky handheld microphone. Yeah. And you can use it as that. Yes. It sounds

645
00:48:53,165 --> 00:48:55,965
Speaker 2:  like If you want to, but then you can also just pull the little receiver

646
00:48:55,985 --> 00:48:56,765
Speaker 2:  out and clip it on.

647
00:48:56,945 --> 00:48:59,445
Speaker 6:  Yep. And then you can Yeah, the transmitter

648
00:48:59,585 --> 00:49:00,405
Speaker 2:  Or the transmitter, yeah.

649
00:49:00,885 --> 00:49:04,715
Speaker 6:  And then you can pop the receiver out too. Plug

650
00:49:04,715 --> 00:49:08,435
Speaker 6:  that right into your phone and Sennheiser

651
00:49:09,225 --> 00:49:13,195
Speaker 6:  that one was the best audio quality to me. Okay. It also has, one of

652
00:49:13,195 --> 00:49:17,155
Speaker 6:  my favorite features on these is a backup recording button. So you can

653
00:49:17,155 --> 00:49:20,475
Speaker 6:  just press this little red button on the device,

654
00:49:21,095 --> 00:49:24,115
Speaker 6:  on the transmitter and it will record the audio locally onto

655
00:49:25,015 --> 00:49:25,835
Speaker 6:  the mic. Oh,

656
00:49:25,835 --> 00:49:26,195
Speaker 2:  That's helpful.

657
00:49:26,495 --> 00:49:29,555
Speaker 6:  So you don't have to go through wireless,

658
00:49:30,495 --> 00:49:33,995
Speaker 6:  you know, run into any issues with signal to noise

659
00:49:34,135 --> 00:49:38,115
Speaker 6:  ratios and all that and it's perfectly there If you, something happens on

660
00:49:38,115 --> 00:49:41,795
Speaker 6:  your recorder, you have this backup recording that's actually helped me

661
00:49:42,015 --> 00:49:44,595
Speaker 6:  so many times in, in these kinds of situations.

662
00:49:44,875 --> 00:49:48,515
Speaker 2:  I was just about to say, I had not thought about this until you just mentioned

663
00:49:48,515 --> 00:49:51,475
Speaker 2:  that, but the problem I've had with these microphones over the years, including

664
00:49:51,535 --> 00:49:54,955
Speaker 2:  all the way back to that, that sure one that I could plug into my phone was

665
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:59,025
Speaker 2:  sometimes my phone just wouldn't use it.

666
00:49:59,225 --> 00:50:02,625
Speaker 2:  I would, I would press record on something and it would just pick a different

667
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:05,985
Speaker 2:  microphone to record from and I, and I wouldn't notice until afterwards because

668
00:50:06,005 --> 00:50:08,825
Speaker 2:  the thing was connected. It all seemed to be working, but then it was like

669
00:50:08,825 --> 00:50:12,025
Speaker 2:  I opened voice memos and hit record and the wrong mic picks up and

670
00:50:12,765 --> 00:50:16,505
Speaker 2:  you're just sort of hosed because phones are not very good at like

671
00:50:16,725 --> 00:50:20,505
Speaker 2:  giving you a, a menu to tell you when it's switching from microphone to microphone.

672
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:23,425
Speaker 2:  Has that gotten better in general? Like are phones better at this game than

673
00:50:23,425 --> 00:50:23,825
Speaker 2:  they used to be?

674
00:50:24,265 --> 00:50:28,205
Speaker 6:  I think so. Okay. I was very skeptical of this as like the

675
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:32,205
Speaker 6:  iPhone is like, it's hard to, when you're

676
00:50:32,205 --> 00:50:35,645
Speaker 6:  in the phone app or the camera app, it's hard to like

677
00:50:36,355 --> 00:50:40,005
Speaker 6:  know what audio source you're using. Right. So you kind of just have to trust

678
00:50:40,005 --> 00:50:43,685
Speaker 6:  it, recognized it. Android is better at this so you can actually like choose

679
00:50:43,865 --> 00:50:47,725
Speaker 6:  the audio source. But I was always scared of that

680
00:50:47,865 --> 00:50:51,725
Speaker 6:  So, I would always use an external, like another app to confirm because

681
00:50:52,145 --> 00:50:55,965
Speaker 6:  you know, the Roads app will tell you what specifically the

682
00:50:55,965 --> 00:50:59,805
Speaker 6:  interface you're using is. But it has, phones have gotten a lot better at

683
00:50:59,805 --> 00:51:03,325
Speaker 6:  this. That being said, phones microphones have gotten a lot better that

684
00:51:03,705 --> 00:51:05,685
Speaker 6:  in general. So there's that too.

685
00:51:06,155 --> 00:51:09,865
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's actually a good question. How do you feel like these

686
00:51:09,865 --> 00:51:13,065
Speaker 2:  compare? Obviously there's a usability difference where you don't have to

687
00:51:13,065 --> 00:51:16,705
Speaker 2:  hold your phone up to your face, which goes a really long way. But in terms

688
00:51:16,725 --> 00:51:20,705
Speaker 2:  of audio quality, you're right that the internal microphone

689
00:51:20,705 --> 00:51:24,345
Speaker 2:  on your phone, If, you have a recent high-end phone is

690
00:51:24,585 --> 00:51:28,465
Speaker 2:  probably very good. Are these still kind of like a, like

691
00:51:28,545 --> 00:51:32,385
Speaker 2:  a full level or two up from that even as they get smaller and cheaper

692
00:51:32,445 --> 00:51:33,305
Speaker 2:  and easier to use?

693
00:51:33,495 --> 00:51:37,465
Speaker 6:  Yeah, totally. I think so there's, there's some plus and minuses like, and

694
00:51:37,655 --> 00:51:41,465
Speaker 6:  smartphones, you get stereo recording a lot. So If, you

695
00:51:41,585 --> 00:51:45,145
Speaker 6:  really want like an ambient track when you're like

696
00:51:45,145 --> 00:51:48,905
Speaker 6:  recording a scene with your phone. That I like using that

697
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:52,465
Speaker 6:  stereo recording sometimes. But there is some, a lot of color,

698
00:51:52,465 --> 00:51:56,345
Speaker 6:  especially the iPhone. There's a lot like brighter sounding,

699
00:51:56,455 --> 00:52:00,425
Speaker 6:  like it's a lot of high end in the recordings. It's a little less

700
00:52:00,745 --> 00:52:04,625
Speaker 6:  controllable. So I in general, like especially Sennheiser

701
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:07,905
Speaker 6:  insurer, like they've been developing this technology for so long. So

702
00:52:08,535 --> 00:52:12,025
Speaker 6:  they do sound a lot better than the traditional just holding your phone

703
00:52:12,485 --> 00:52:15,025
Speaker 6:  up to your face, especially in post-production. Yeah.

704
00:52:15,205 --> 00:52:18,985
Speaker 2:  Are these companies doing something different with these

705
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:22,585
Speaker 2:  mics because of the way that they're gonna be used? I mean, you know, Sennheiser

706
00:52:22,585 --> 00:52:26,425
Speaker 2:  and Road and all these other companies make other microphones. I'm on a,

707
00:52:26,485 --> 00:52:30,345
Speaker 2:  I'm on a sure mic on a road stand right now recording this. So they all know

708
00:52:30,365 --> 00:52:33,905
Speaker 2:  how to make like a high-end microphone. But these are like you're saying

709
00:52:33,905 --> 00:52:36,865
Speaker 2:  at the beginning, sort of a very specific thing for a very specific use case

710
00:52:37,765 --> 00:52:41,385
Speaker 2:  as you test them. Can you tell these are like designed to be used on

711
00:52:41,405 --> 00:52:43,425
Speaker 2:  TikTok in some meaningful way?

712
00:52:44,325 --> 00:52:47,745
Speaker 6:  Not, not really. Okay. I mean more when you looking at the,

713
00:52:48,645 --> 00:52:52,145
Speaker 6:  the app side of it, but these are all like omnidirectional

714
00:52:52,145 --> 00:52:55,625
Speaker 6:  microphones that, you know, lavaliers on like any,

715
00:52:56,205 --> 00:52:59,825
Speaker 6:  you know, live set have been using for, for decades. So

716
00:52:59,935 --> 00:53:03,825
Speaker 6:  there's not much different for that. It is like, because

717
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:07,025
Speaker 6:  you're moving around and you're outside and you wanna make sure it's, you

718
00:53:07,025 --> 00:53:09,465
Speaker 6:  know, it's on your shirt, it's getting you when you're turning your head

719
00:53:09,465 --> 00:53:12,985
Speaker 6:  and all that. So it's more like the performance side of it.

720
00:53:13,495 --> 00:53:17,465
Speaker 2:  That makes sense. Yeah. I, I do wonder how much they're learning to

721
00:53:17,465 --> 00:53:21,385
Speaker 2:  do to compensate for people who don't have a ton of experience

722
00:53:21,385 --> 00:53:24,905
Speaker 2:  using mics who are suddenly clipping mics to themselves. Sure. And like the

723
00:53:24,905 --> 00:53:27,365
Speaker 2:  thing you just said about being able to sort of swivel your head is like

724
00:53:27,365 --> 00:53:31,125
Speaker 2:  that's a big one, right? You most people have terrible mic technique and

725
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:34,685
Speaker 2:  understanding how to talk into a microphone is a thing that takes real practice.

726
00:53:35,105 --> 00:53:38,885
Speaker 2:  And so for something like this, like I would assume a lot of these companies

727
00:53:38,885 --> 00:53:42,005
Speaker 2:  are spending time trying to think about, okay, what weird places are people

728
00:53:42,005 --> 00:53:45,285
Speaker 2:  going to stick this and how are they gonna use it and how can we

729
00:53:45,635 --> 00:53:48,325
Speaker 2:  account for that? And, and again, I think it makes sense that a lot of that

730
00:53:48,345 --> 00:53:52,085
Speaker 2:  is going into the software and stuff that's actually being built into phones.

731
00:53:52,715 --> 00:53:56,365
Speaker 6:  Yeah, totally. Like there's 32 bit float, which is like

732
00:53:56,675 --> 00:54:00,045
Speaker 6:  recording at a bit rate that is gonna prevent you from

733
00:54:01,085 --> 00:54:04,765
Speaker 6:  clipping audio, which is a big problem

734
00:54:05,065 --> 00:54:08,605
Speaker 6:  in like any microphone where you're not Yeah. You're not

735
00:54:08,605 --> 00:54:12,365
Speaker 6:  monitoring the levels of these microphones with your headphones or even

736
00:54:12,365 --> 00:54:16,325
Speaker 6:  seeing levels on some on any of these. There's that and then there's also

737
00:54:16,325 --> 00:54:19,405
Speaker 6:  the noise cancellation, So I, I should have mentioned that like DJI has a

738
00:54:20,055 --> 00:54:24,045
Speaker 6:  noise softener basically will take a lot of the background

739
00:54:24,045 --> 00:54:27,565
Speaker 6:  noise out, which you know, is something you're not gonna be going in

740
00:54:27,995 --> 00:54:31,845
Speaker 6:  your computer and trying to dial down if you're just going into

741
00:54:31,845 --> 00:54:32,805
Speaker 6:  TikTok most of the time.

742
00:54:33,055 --> 00:54:36,525
Speaker 2:  Right. Not everybody has a you to make everything sound incredible all the

743
00:54:36,525 --> 00:54:40,365
Speaker 2:  time. I highly recommend it by the way, If, you can have an Andrew

744
00:54:40,385 --> 00:54:44,365
Speaker 2:  to do it. I recommend having an Andrew. Let's, I I want to

745
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:46,765
Speaker 2:  hear a couple of these and, and test them a little bit, but I am curious

746
00:54:46,765 --> 00:54:50,645
Speaker 2:  to have, are, are there any other sort of standout features from some of

747
00:54:50,645 --> 00:54:52,925
Speaker 2:  the ones that you tested that you're like, oh, if only I could borrow this

748
00:54:52,925 --> 00:54:54,565
Speaker 2:  and stick it on the DJI It would be even better.

749
00:54:55,275 --> 00:54:59,005
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so what DJI two has

750
00:54:59,265 --> 00:55:03,085
Speaker 6:  is like audio levels. You can see the audio levels on the receiver. Mm.

751
00:55:03,945 --> 00:55:07,725
Speaker 6:  That's a really nifty one. Also being able to plug in an external

752
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:11,645
Speaker 6:  lavalier, which a lot, some of the higher end of these do the road

753
00:55:11,885 --> 00:55:15,405
Speaker 6:  wireless models do and that of course the backup

754
00:55:15,435 --> 00:55:19,205
Speaker 6:  feature like right. That like onboard recording

755
00:55:19,305 --> 00:55:23,245
Speaker 6:  is. So it's just like once you have that you don't wanna not use

756
00:55:23,245 --> 00:55:23,685
Speaker 6:  it anymore.

757
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:26,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah. That, that makes total sense. You know what I mean? Alright, so you're

758
00:55:26,925 --> 00:55:30,885
Speaker 2:  on the DJI, which sounds very good. I'm, I'm super impressed.

759
00:55:30,885 --> 00:55:34,805
Speaker 2:  Cool. Cool. I wanted, I wanna try the worst one you tried.

760
00:55:34,845 --> 00:55:38,045
Speaker 2:  Okay. But before we do that, what can we try just like one of the others,

761
00:55:38,185 --> 00:55:41,925
Speaker 2:  I'm curious to see kind of the, the range of quality we're looking at here.

762
00:55:41,925 --> 00:55:44,285
Speaker 2:  So let's, let's just switch to one of the other ones you liked, like slightly

763
00:55:44,355 --> 00:55:47,405
Speaker 2:  less and I'm just curious if I can even tell the difference in the audio.

764
00:55:47,715 --> 00:55:50,525
Speaker 6:  Sure, yeah, let's use the Road Wireless Micro, which is just

765
00:55:51,415 --> 00:55:53,565
Speaker 6:  plugs right into with USBC.

766
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:57,365
Speaker 2:  All right. So now you're on, you're on the road, the Road Micro, is that

767
00:55:57,365 --> 00:55:57,765
Speaker 2:  what you called it?

768
00:55:58,065 --> 00:56:01,005
Speaker 6:  Yes. The Road Wireless Micro just came out last month.

769
00:56:01,555 --> 00:56:05,005
Speaker 2:  Okay. I would say it's, we're we're like kind of in range. Yeah. This feels,

770
00:56:05,125 --> 00:56:09,005
Speaker 2:  I mean you're, you're in a pretty quiet room. Yeah. But this,

771
00:56:09,035 --> 00:56:12,985
Speaker 2:  this sounds, I don't know, like maybe slightly more compressed,

772
00:56:13,005 --> 00:56:14,705
Speaker 2:  but I also think I'm probably listening for it.

773
00:56:15,135 --> 00:56:19,105
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I, I doubt you'll hear much of a difference. Like if like

774
00:56:19,105 --> 00:56:21,625
Speaker 6:  listeners are listening on their phone or a Bluetooth speaker or something

775
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:21,905
Speaker 6:  like that,

776
00:56:22,585 --> 00:56:25,605
Speaker 2:  Whenever we do these, I think about my wife who listens to podcasts just

777
00:56:25,625 --> 00:56:28,765
Speaker 2:  out the speaker of her 4-year-old phone. Yeah. And I'm like, this must sound

778
00:56:28,765 --> 00:56:32,285
Speaker 2:  like nothing to you, Anna. Like, she's just like, what do you mean these

779
00:56:32,285 --> 00:56:32,925
Speaker 2:  all sound terrible.

780
00:56:35,235 --> 00:56:39,165
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So it's, it's really nifty but I, I like it because it's super compact.

781
00:56:39,365 --> 00:56:43,125
Speaker 6:  I just keep in my pocket like all the time and like I plugged in my

782
00:56:43,125 --> 00:56:46,645
Speaker 6:  laptop, which is cool, which I didn't get to in the video, but yeah, you

783
00:56:46,645 --> 00:56:50,045
Speaker 6:  plug it in via USBC, you can also plug it into your laptop If, you have that.

784
00:56:50,225 --> 00:56:50,445
Speaker 6:  So

785
00:56:50,795 --> 00:56:54,605
Speaker 2:  That is actually pretty handy. Yeah. Being able to like, yay for

786
00:56:54,605 --> 00:56:58,045
Speaker 2:  universal charging ports. Right. But being able to just kind of have a plug

787
00:56:58,045 --> 00:57:01,645
Speaker 2:  and play mic into any device that you have goes a

788
00:57:01,645 --> 00:57:04,885
Speaker 2:  surprising long way. Like I've, I give a lot of people

789
00:57:05,745 --> 00:57:09,725
Speaker 2:  the same speech about how important it is to sound good on video calls

790
00:57:10,365 --> 00:57:12,685
Speaker 2:  and this is the kind of thing that you might even, like if you're giving

791
00:57:12,765 --> 00:57:15,525
Speaker 2:  a presentation or at work, this might be useful in that same way.

792
00:57:16,115 --> 00:57:19,805
Speaker 6:  Yeah. People have told me that they want something like that for home,

793
00:57:20,405 --> 00:57:23,365
Speaker 6:  for their like zoom call. So I'm like, oh it's, it's interesting. You're

794
00:57:23,365 --> 00:57:27,245
Speaker 6:  gonna like walk around your kitchen while you're on the call, just have

795
00:57:27,245 --> 00:57:29,645
Speaker 6:  it clipped to your, to your shirt. So yeah. That's

796
00:57:29,645 --> 00:57:31,765
Speaker 2:  Cool. It's kind of a good idea. Yeah. You could sound like you're sitting

797
00:57:31,765 --> 00:57:34,765
Speaker 2:  right at your computer but just be like aimlessly wandering around your house

798
00:57:34,765 --> 00:57:37,045
Speaker 2:  with AirPods and a fancy microphone. The

799
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,725
Speaker 6:  Mic doesn't move. You do. Yeah, exactly.

800
00:57:40,505 --> 00:57:43,885
Speaker 2:  That's pretty good. We should start a company and that's the tagline. It's

801
00:57:43,885 --> 00:57:47,725
Speaker 2:  gonna be incredible. Alright, let's try one more and the one I wanna

802
00:57:47,745 --> 00:57:51,245
Speaker 2:  try is the, the like the TikTok microphone.

803
00:57:52,605 --> 00:57:55,845
Speaker 2:  I think everybody knows the one I'm talking about, but you got the one. Yes,

804
00:57:55,885 --> 00:57:59,525
Speaker 2:  that is the one and I would like to hear how it sounds. Okay,

805
00:57:59,615 --> 00:58:00,205
Speaker 6:  Let's do it.

806
00:58:00,745 --> 00:58:04,325
Speaker 2:  All right. You're now in the software that I'm seeing as USB audio

807
00:58:04,545 --> 00:58:07,405
Speaker 2:  1.0 which already feels alarming. How we doing?

808
00:58:08,115 --> 00:58:09,565
Speaker 6:  Okay, can you hear me now? Oh

809
00:58:09,915 --> 00:58:13,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah, this is what I knew this was gonna It's bad.

810
00:58:14,235 --> 00:58:17,125
Speaker 2:  It's like, it's just, it's just bad. It's,

811
00:58:18,465 --> 00:58:22,205
Speaker 2:  you sound like someone who put their AirPods in

812
00:58:22,375 --> 00:58:26,325
Speaker 2:  wrong. I've been noticing a lot that people wear their AirPods wrong.

813
00:58:26,355 --> 00:58:28,685
Speaker 2:  Have you ever noticed this? The people who wear them so that they're sort

814
00:58:28,685 --> 00:58:31,925
Speaker 2:  of sticking directly out of their head. It's like they've screwed them into

815
00:58:31,945 --> 00:58:35,525
Speaker 2:  far into their air canals and they just, it's like, it's like you have antenna

816
00:58:35,525 --> 00:58:37,925
Speaker 2:  coming out of your ears. That's what you sound like. Yeah.

817
00:58:38,085 --> 00:58:41,845
Speaker 6:  I have seen someone in the office not gonna lie with wearing air puts like

818
00:58:41,845 --> 00:58:41,965
Speaker 6:  that

819
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:44,725
Speaker 2:  Listen name and shame Andrew, it's time.

820
00:58:47,145 --> 00:58:48,405
Speaker 2:  So first of all, what is this Mike?

821
00:58:49,795 --> 00:58:53,325
Speaker 6:  It's a good question because I don't really know. The

822
00:58:53,825 --> 00:58:57,605
Speaker 6:  box that came in says the K eight wireless microphone. Okay.

823
00:58:58,795 --> 00:59:02,605
Speaker 6:  I've seen this on TikTok without that branding, the same box without that

824
00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:06,365
Speaker 6:  branding, it is just kind of this generic wireless

825
00:59:06,455 --> 00:59:10,295
Speaker 6:  microphone that you plug into your phone has. And then

826
00:59:10,355 --> 00:59:13,975
Speaker 6:  one little other thing that you clip on your shirt with the mic

827
00:59:15,275 --> 00:59:19,095
Speaker 6:  and I've like, people are like hawking these on TikTok for five

828
00:59:19,095 --> 00:59:19,375
Speaker 6:  bucks.

829
00:59:19,845 --> 00:59:23,645
Speaker 2:  Yeah. It's the one you can find a million identical looking

830
00:59:23,755 --> 00:59:27,325
Speaker 2:  ones on like Ali Express and the TikTok shop and Amazon and

831
00:59:27,755 --> 00:59:31,685
Speaker 2:  like I assume they're all the same thing from like a giant

832
00:59:31,965 --> 00:59:34,365
Speaker 2:  bin in a factory somewhere in China. That's what it

833
00:59:34,365 --> 00:59:38,285
Speaker 6:  Seems to be. Yeah. Yeah. I went, I bought another one recently just to see

834
00:59:38,285 --> 00:59:40,805
Speaker 6:  if it was the same and it was exactly the same. Oh,

835
00:59:40,965 --> 00:59:44,685
Speaker 2:  Interesting. Okay. Yeah. And this is, this has become

836
00:59:45,025 --> 00:59:48,125
Speaker 2:  the TikTok microphone. Is it just 'cause it's cheap? Like every, everybody's

837
00:59:48,125 --> 00:59:50,965
Speaker 2:  just like, oh this sounds better than my phone and it's cheap. Even though

838
00:59:51,005 --> 00:59:53,165
Speaker 2:  I would say it demonstrably does not sound better than your phone.

839
00:59:53,475 --> 00:59:57,245
Speaker 6:  Yeah, totally. It it's like because it was, you know,

840
00:59:57,475 --> 01:00:01,205
Speaker 6:  sold on one of these like bulk shops where you can get a whole bunch and

841
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:04,885
Speaker 6:  and and drop ship them but you know, it

842
01:00:04,965 --> 01:00:08,685
Speaker 6:  isolates your voice more. It does versus like the phone is gonna be like,

843
01:00:09,585 --> 01:00:12,795
Speaker 6:  it's gonna pick up a lot of other things in the room. A lot of people record

844
01:00:12,795 --> 01:00:16,665
Speaker 6:  in their car so this If you hold this up

845
01:00:16,785 --> 01:00:20,585
Speaker 6:  to your, your mouth in the car, maybe you won't get as

846
01:00:20,585 --> 01:00:22,665
Speaker 6:  like a boxier sound than usual.

847
01:00:22,975 --> 01:00:26,465
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And there is something to that, that at least you have something sort

848
01:00:26,465 --> 01:00:30,265
Speaker 2:  of close and directional and that's helpful. Like that is the basic mic

849
01:00:30,505 --> 01:00:34,305
Speaker 2:  technique we give most people, but I still feel like this is much worse than

850
01:00:34,935 --> 01:00:38,785
Speaker 2:  holding up the, the white ear pod microphone to your mouth.

851
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:41,465
Speaker 2:  Like if you're gonna hold a microphone, that one sounds much better than

852
01:00:41,465 --> 01:00:41,945
Speaker 2:  this one does.

853
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:42,985
Speaker 6:  Totally. Yeah.

854
01:00:43,505 --> 01:00:47,145
Speaker 2:  I guess it is $20 versus $5. But like I'm gonna, I'm gonna go ahead and say

855
01:00:47,145 --> 01:00:48,465
Speaker 2:  that's worth the $15 investment.

856
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:52,305
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And who knows how long these are gonna be for that price. Like I, I've

857
01:00:52,305 --> 01:00:55,505
Speaker 6:  seen them on Amazon for like $30. Yeah.

858
01:00:55,575 --> 01:00:59,305
Speaker 2:  Yeah that's fair. Alright, switch back to the good mic So I. Don't have to

859
01:00:59,305 --> 01:01:01,345
Speaker 2:  listen to this anymore. And then I have a couple more questions and we'll

860
01:01:01,345 --> 01:01:01,585
Speaker 2:  let you go.

861
01:01:01,855 --> 01:01:02,425
Speaker 6:  Okay, great.

862
01:01:03,365 --> 01:01:04,665
Speaker 2:  All right. Are we back to a good mic?

863
01:01:05,225 --> 01:01:06,225
Speaker 6:  I think So I, how

864
01:01:06,225 --> 01:01:08,905
Speaker 2:  Do, we're back to a good mic. This sounds good. Is this the DJI again?

865
01:01:09,255 --> 01:01:13,225
Speaker 6:  This is the Sen Heiser profile Wireless. I figured since we

866
01:01:13,345 --> 01:01:16,705
Speaker 6:  I mentioned it, I wanted to demonstrate how it sounded.

867
01:01:17,205 --> 01:01:20,465
Speaker 2:  It does sound good. I yeah, they're all kind of right in range. Yeah, yeah.

868
01:01:20,665 --> 01:01:24,625
Speaker 2:  That this is, which is good news honestly. Especially I feel

869
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:28,405
Speaker 2:  like DJ's thing is just as good

870
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:32,645
Speaker 2:  a little wacky to figure out and cheaper. It's like keeps

871
01:01:32,645 --> 01:01:33,165
Speaker 2:  working for

872
01:01:33,165 --> 01:01:36,205
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I was skeptical of their mics because they're not

873
01:01:36,245 --> 01:01:39,205
Speaker 6:  a microphone company, but it yeah, they they're pretty good.

874
01:01:39,635 --> 01:01:43,565
Speaker 2:  Yeah. That's, that's super exciting. So, okay. You think if I am, if

875
01:01:43,585 --> 01:01:45,965
Speaker 2:  I'm like a creator, starting a TikTok channel

876
01:01:47,635 --> 01:01:51,615
Speaker 2:  DJI into my phone into the TikTok app is like a perfectly viable

877
01:01:52,925 --> 01:01:54,945
Speaker 2:  mic video strategy. We feel good about that.

878
01:01:55,245 --> 01:01:56,345
Speaker 6:  Yes, totally. Yeah. Yeah.

879
01:01:56,645 --> 01:01:59,905
Speaker 2:  That's awesome. That feels like a win. This is like, that is a, that's a

880
01:01:59,905 --> 01:02:01,585
Speaker 2:  big level up for a lot of people pretty fast.

881
01:02:01,775 --> 01:02:05,585
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And also If, you end up like getting a better camera and

882
01:02:05,585 --> 01:02:08,865
Speaker 6:  you're not using just your phone. You can still use this with another camera,

883
01:02:09,115 --> 01:02:13,065
Speaker 6:  which is, is really what is a big difference between that and the

884
01:02:13,065 --> 01:02:16,905
Speaker 6:  Road Mini or the Road micro because you can only use this

885
01:02:16,905 --> 01:02:20,325
Speaker 6:  with the US like something with the USB port. Right. Taking audio in. Yeah.

886
01:02:20,515 --> 01:02:24,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah. That's, that's very cool. So are you, are you using these mics in your

887
01:02:24,205 --> 01:02:26,725
Speaker 2:  own gear now? What's your new setup?

888
01:02:27,105 --> 01:02:31,005
Speaker 6:  Yes. This past year or two we've kind of like stopped carrying around the

889
01:02:31,135 --> 01:02:34,965
Speaker 6:  bulky professional wireless microphone systems when

890
01:02:34,965 --> 01:02:38,925
Speaker 6:  we're like running around. I remember at CES last year, we

891
01:02:39,105 --> 01:02:42,965
Speaker 6:  didn't really use those. We used the road, the wireless GoTo

892
01:02:43,185 --> 01:02:47,085
Speaker 6:  for most of our stuff we were doing out in the field. And

893
01:02:47,715 --> 01:02:51,525
Speaker 6:  yeah. And for c ees, I would love to carry around this Sennheiser

894
01:02:52,225 --> 01:02:56,205
Speaker 6:  kit because it's super compact. It's got this neat carrying case.

895
01:02:56,515 --> 01:02:56,805
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

896
01:02:57,155 --> 01:03:00,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah. That, I mean it goes a really long way and I think to me the

897
01:03:00,925 --> 01:03:01,805
Speaker 2:  next step then

898
01:03:03,365 --> 01:03:07,025
Speaker 2:  it kind of feels like getting much smaller is maybe not super

899
01:03:07,025 --> 01:03:10,785
Speaker 2:  useful. It feels like the next step is starting to solve some of the UI stuff.

900
01:03:10,785 --> 01:03:13,065
Speaker 2:  Right. Because I feel like especially the things that are connected to the

901
01:03:13,065 --> 01:03:16,865
Speaker 2:  phone, there's just not great sort of really

902
01:03:16,895 --> 01:03:20,025
Speaker 2:  fine grained manual control in the way that you can do like

903
01:03:20,645 --> 01:03:24,065
Speaker 2:  pretty professional stuff with your video camera at this point. It feels

904
01:03:24,065 --> 01:03:26,625
Speaker 2:  like audio still has a little bit of catching up there, but maybe that's

905
01:03:26,625 --> 01:03:27,065
Speaker 2:  the next thing.

906
01:03:27,295 --> 01:03:30,665
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I think you're sacrificing a lot of stuff by making them smaller. So

907
01:03:30,735 --> 01:03:34,545
Speaker 6:  there's gonna be some happy medium there where like maybe the receiver's

908
01:03:34,665 --> 01:03:38,425
Speaker 6:  a little bigger that you can adjust some settings, but the

909
01:03:38,425 --> 01:03:41,465
Speaker 6:  mics are still kind of tiny. Yeah. So they don't show up on screen, you know.

910
01:03:41,895 --> 01:03:45,825
Speaker 2:  That is fair. Okay, last thing and then you're gonna go, you have, you are

911
01:03:45,825 --> 01:03:48,385
Speaker 2:  the person who knows the answer to this question. Where is the correct place

912
01:03:48,845 --> 01:03:52,105
Speaker 2:  on your person to put the mic to do this?

913
01:03:52,685 --> 01:03:56,265
Speaker 6:  So I always like going like two buttons down

914
01:03:57,605 --> 01:04:01,065
Speaker 6:  on, on like a dress shirt. Okay. It's a very specific

915
01:04:01,735 --> 01:04:05,305
Speaker 6:  type of way to dress so it's not accurate for everyone. But

916
01:04:05,305 --> 01:04:08,065
Speaker 2:  You're kind of like right at like mid chest height it seems like at that

917
01:04:08,065 --> 01:04:08,385
Speaker 2:  point. Yeah,

918
01:04:08,385 --> 01:04:12,065
Speaker 6:  Totally. Like If, you just, you put it where your, you know where your heart

919
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:13,985
Speaker 6:  is is like a good Oh

920
01:04:13,985 --> 01:04:15,945
Speaker 2:  Yeah, okay. Right in the middle. Yeah,

921
01:04:15,975 --> 01:04:16,465
Speaker 6:  Totally.

922
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:20,625
Speaker 2:  Okay. So not on the brim of my hat, which is a thing that I saw somebody

923
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:22,465
Speaker 2:  do and thought that was very cool and wanted steal.

924
01:04:22,695 --> 01:04:26,265
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's an interesting idea. They're omnidirectional so it's not,

925
01:04:26,535 --> 01:04:29,985
Speaker 6:  it's not gonna not pick up your voice,

926
01:04:30,445 --> 01:04:34,145
Speaker 6:  but it'll, it's a little silly. It's, it's obviously for,

927
01:04:34,285 --> 01:04:35,825
Speaker 6:  for aesthetic purposes.

928
01:04:36,375 --> 01:04:40,065
Speaker 2:  Okay. All right. All right. Well this is as, as someone who ends up always

929
01:04:40,065 --> 01:04:43,425
Speaker 2:  putting it on my collar and then it like droops all weird. This is good advice.

930
01:04:43,535 --> 01:04:46,705
Speaker 2:  Yeah, yeah. Like wherever your, your hand goes when you say the pledge of

931
01:04:46,705 --> 01:04:48,305
Speaker 2:  allegiance, that's where you put the mic.

932
01:04:48,455 --> 01:04:52,265
Speaker 6:  Yeah, totally. And now these have mic little magnets on them. You can

933
01:04:52,265 --> 01:04:54,785
Speaker 6:  really just, you can clip 'em on anywhere on your clothing.

934
01:04:54,855 --> 01:04:58,305
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. The magnet over the clip thing is a huge upgrade. Yeah. Cannot

935
01:04:58,625 --> 01:05:01,305
Speaker 2:  recommend that enough. Alright Andrew, thank you for coming back. It's nice

936
01:05:01,305 --> 01:05:01,945
Speaker 2:  to see you. Yeah,

937
01:05:01,945 --> 01:05:02,625
Speaker 6:  Thanks for having me.

938
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:06,665
Speaker 2:  Alright, we gotta take one more break and then we're gonna come back and

956
01:06:13,245 --> 01:06:15,845
Speaker 2:  week. This week we have a question about web browsers.

957
01:06:17,345 --> 01:06:21,325
Speaker 7:  Hi, this is Joey from Portland, Oregon and I have a question about web

958
01:06:21,325 --> 01:06:25,125
Speaker 7:  browsers. Just watching your latest or listen your latest Vergecast

959
01:06:25,125 --> 01:06:29,085
Speaker 7:  about, you know, Chrome and, and I was just thinking just recently

960
01:06:29,325 --> 01:06:33,165
Speaker 7:  I, I started switching, I'm using Chrome to

961
01:06:33,485 --> 01:06:37,365
Speaker 7:  safari on my MacBook Air and you know, just

962
01:06:37,365 --> 01:06:40,645
Speaker 7:  heard that like it's more efficient and you know, it's a little, it's a little

963
01:06:40,645 --> 01:06:44,605
Speaker 7:  faster but definitely closely uses less battery and I haven't really

964
01:06:44,605 --> 01:06:48,525
Speaker 7:  noticed that. I mean I haven't done extensive testing but

965
01:06:48,765 --> 01:06:52,525
Speaker 7:  I, like most people, I live in the browser for the most part and

966
01:06:53,205 --> 01:06:56,525
Speaker 7:  I use safari extensions, I use extensions

967
01:06:57,025 --> 01:07:00,925
Speaker 7:  and seems like it's about the same battery life doesn't really see any

968
01:07:00,925 --> 01:07:04,645
Speaker 7:  faster. So is is that really true? Is, is

969
01:07:04,765 --> 01:07:07,805
Speaker 7:  Safari really noticeably like more efficient?

970
01:07:09,185 --> 01:07:11,525
Speaker 7:  Be curious to your thoughts. Thanks, bye.

971
01:07:12,485 --> 01:07:15,865
Speaker 2:  One of the reasons I really like this question is that it's really hard to

972
01:07:16,015 --> 01:07:19,785
Speaker 2:  test this question. Browsers are complicated

973
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:23,745
Speaker 2:  because they're so much more than just one individual thing. Like

974
01:07:23,845 --> 01:07:27,585
Speaker 2:  the way that you use your browser is so personal

975
01:07:27,765 --> 01:07:31,705
Speaker 2:  and so unique to you maybe even in ways that you

976
01:07:31,705 --> 01:07:35,545
Speaker 2:  don't understand, right? Think about the number of tabs that you have open,

977
01:07:35,545 --> 01:07:39,105
Speaker 2:  whether you tend to use multiple windows with tabs

978
01:07:39,485 --> 01:07:43,425
Speaker 2:  or just have one window with a thousand tabs in it. Are

979
01:07:43,425 --> 01:07:46,905
Speaker 2:  you a bookmarks person? Do you have lots of extensions? Are you

980
01:07:46,905 --> 01:07:50,745
Speaker 2:  constantly running like really intense web apps like Gmail

981
01:07:50,925 --> 01:07:54,825
Speaker 2:  or Figma or Canva or things like that? Or are you the kind of

982
01:07:54,825 --> 01:07:58,745
Speaker 2:  person who is just like opening a web browser, going to cnn.com looking

983
01:07:58,745 --> 01:08:02,625
Speaker 2:  at some news and then moving on into your day? Maybe no other piece of

984
01:08:02,905 --> 01:08:06,465
Speaker 2:  software is so varied in its use that way

985
01:08:06,655 --> 01:08:10,145
Speaker 2:  than a web browser. So it's very hard for anyone to say

986
01:08:11,055 --> 01:08:14,905
Speaker 2:  here is the best web browser for x, y, or Z reason, right? I think one

987
01:08:15,005 --> 01:08:18,885
Speaker 2:  reason people think Safari is the best Mac browser is

988
01:08:18,885 --> 01:08:22,525
Speaker 2:  just that it's so well integrated with all of Apple's other

989
01:08:23,085 --> 01:08:26,645
Speaker 2:  products and its operating systems. There's actually not real

990
01:08:27,005 --> 01:08:30,685
Speaker 2:  evidence anywhere that I can find that Safari is faster or more performant

991
01:08:30,685 --> 01:08:34,365
Speaker 2:  or better for battery life in any meaningful way. It's just

992
01:08:34,435 --> 01:08:37,885
Speaker 2:  that it is so sort of deeply integrated inside of the system

993
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:42,005
Speaker 2:  that it feels better, the share sheet works better, you can open things and

994
01:08:42,005 --> 01:08:45,245
Speaker 2:  move them around more quickly. It feels the macies

995
01:08:45,865 --> 01:08:49,805
Speaker 2:  of the Mac browsers and it feels the iPhones of the iPhone browsers the same

996
01:08:49,805 --> 01:08:53,725
Speaker 2:  way that Chrome does on Android. Like you can run other browsers

997
01:08:53,825 --> 01:08:57,645
Speaker 2:  on a Chromebook than Chrome but it's gonna feel worse even if

998
01:08:57,645 --> 01:09:01,525
Speaker 2:  it's just as fast. So all of that is to say, I think figuring

999
01:09:01,665 --> 01:09:05,285
Speaker 2:  out which browser is for you, you should think much more about

1000
01:09:06,145 --> 01:09:09,885
Speaker 2:  UI and which services you use than really

1001
01:09:10,085 --> 01:09:13,565
Speaker 2:  throwing your lot behind one product or another. Like I said, there aren't

1002
01:09:13,605 --> 01:09:17,525
Speaker 2:  a lot of ways to kind of apples to apples compare one browser to

1003
01:09:17,525 --> 01:09:20,885
Speaker 2:  the other. But there is one benchmark that I like, it's called Speedometer

1004
01:09:20,885 --> 01:09:24,285
Speaker 2:  3.0 from Browser Bench and it tries to mimic

1005
01:09:24,815 --> 01:09:28,245
Speaker 2:  using a web app. It's like a to-do list thing that is trying to move stuff

1006
01:09:28,245 --> 01:09:31,405
Speaker 2:  around. So it executes JavaScript and tries to run stuff in the background

1007
01:09:31,465 --> 01:09:35,405
Speaker 2:  and also, you know, loads news pages. And the idea is just a sort of

1008
01:09:35,405 --> 01:09:39,285
Speaker 2:  normal web usage. It's not a perfect benchmark, I

1009
01:09:39,285 --> 01:09:42,565
Speaker 2:  don't think any benchmark of anything is perfect, but at least you get some

1010
01:09:42,565 --> 01:09:46,365
Speaker 2:  kind of apples to apples rough performance metric for how a browser

1011
01:09:46,365 --> 01:09:50,205
Speaker 2:  works. I tested it on seven browsers on my Mac

1012
01:09:50,205 --> 01:09:54,165
Speaker 2:  Mini and let me just read you the scores. So hire is better. Chrome

1013
01:09:54,355 --> 01:09:57,725
Speaker 2:  came in first with 48.2, safari got

1014
01:09:57,725 --> 01:10:01,525
Speaker 2:  47.4 not super far down. Then there was Brave

1015
01:10:01,575 --> 01:10:05,565
Speaker 2:  44.7, edge 44.5. So basically the same between those

1016
01:10:05,765 --> 01:10:09,565
Speaker 2:  two. Firefox, 41.4, arc 38.3 and

1017
01:10:09,565 --> 01:10:13,485
Speaker 2:  DuckDuckGo 38.1. Reasonable range top to

1018
01:10:13,485 --> 01:10:17,325
Speaker 2:  bottom there. But they all have a bit of a margin of error in them.

1019
01:10:17,705 --> 01:10:21,525
Speaker 2:  And realistically you might notice a performance

1020
01:10:21,525 --> 01:10:24,485
Speaker 2:  difference between like Chrome at the very top and DuckDuckGo at the very

1021
01:10:24,645 --> 01:10:28,365
Speaker 2:  bottom. But like should you use Chrome or Safari based on the

1022
01:10:28,365 --> 01:10:32,085
Speaker 2:  0.8 points between them, no, there are other

1023
01:10:32,085 --> 01:10:35,845
Speaker 2:  reasons that that browser will feel better or worse to you than

1024
01:10:36,305 --> 01:10:40,285
Speaker 2:  the raw performance score of how it does on this one benchmark. All

1025
01:10:40,285 --> 01:10:43,645
Speaker 2:  of this is to say I think browsers are fascinating for this exact reason,

1026
01:10:43,735 --> 01:10:47,365
Speaker 2:  right? It's not a question of optimizing

1027
01:10:47,855 --> 01:10:51,765
Speaker 2:  ruthlessly for one specific use case. Browsers are all things to all

1028
01:10:51,765 --> 01:10:55,005
Speaker 2:  people. And what I would do is basically

1029
01:10:55,545 --> 01:10:58,725
Speaker 2:  try to figure out the UI that works for you. Whether you want

1030
01:10:59,465 --> 01:11:03,365
Speaker 2:  Chrome which has more sort of accessibility to extensions

1031
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:07,405
Speaker 2:  and does a better job, I think with some bookmarklets or you want Safari,

1032
01:11:07,405 --> 01:11:10,965
Speaker 2:  which is simple to a fault and just keeps everything very straightforward.

1033
01:11:11,265 --> 01:11:14,485
Speaker 2:  Or you want something like Arc, which has really weird ideas about UI

1034
01:11:15,065 --> 01:11:17,965
Speaker 2:  or you want Brave, which has a lot of additional features and stuff built

1035
01:11:17,995 --> 01:11:21,725
Speaker 2:  into the browser, you kind of can't pick wrong, right? There are a lot of

1036
01:11:21,725 --> 01:11:25,525
Speaker 2:  browsers out there, a bunch of them are really good. None of them have

1037
01:11:25,665 --> 01:11:29,445
Speaker 2:  any sort of obviously huge increase and

1038
01:11:29,445 --> 01:11:33,245
Speaker 2:  killer app over any of the others. So ultimately what I would say

1039
01:11:33,305 --> 01:11:36,725
Speaker 2:  is try a bunch of different browsers and just see what works for you and

1040
01:11:36,935 --> 01:11:40,885
Speaker 2:  don't really worry about spending a ton of time trying to optimize for

1041
01:11:40,885 --> 01:11:44,525
Speaker 2:  performance. I will say If, you open a lot of

1042
01:11:44,595 --> 01:11:48,445
Speaker 2:  tabs, it will crush your memory and it will crush your battery life. And

1043
01:11:49,595 --> 01:11:53,405
Speaker 2:  anecdotally I cannot prove this, but anecdotally Chrome seems to be the worst

1044
01:11:53,405 --> 01:11:57,285
Speaker 2:  at that. That when I have a hundred Chrome tabs open, it just

1045
01:11:57,325 --> 01:12:00,885
Speaker 2:  destroys every computer I've ever used in a way that no other browser does.

1046
01:12:01,365 --> 01:12:05,245
Speaker 2:  I can't prove that, but that is how it feels to me. But in general, the best

1047
01:12:05,245 --> 01:12:08,805
Speaker 2:  thing you can do for your performance and your battery life is manage your

1048
01:12:08,915 --> 01:12:12,685
Speaker 2:  tabs slightly better so that you're not running so many different

1049
01:12:12,685 --> 01:12:16,325
Speaker 2:  versions of any of these browsers at a time. But beyond that,

1050
01:12:16,595 --> 01:12:20,245
Speaker 2:  just pick the browser you like the best and use it and don't worry about

1051
01:12:20,245 --> 01:12:23,845
Speaker 2:  the rest. And that is actually a pretty good place to be. Lots of different

1052
01:12:23,845 --> 01:12:27,405
Speaker 2:  ideas about browsers out there. Give them all a try. I have seven on my computer

1053
01:12:27,465 --> 01:12:30,245
Speaker 2:  now because I downloaded them all and I'm gonna keep 'em and I'm gonna try

1054
01:12:30,365 --> 01:12:33,845
Speaker 2:  'em 'cause this is the life I've chosen for myself. Anyway,

1055
01:12:34,155 --> 01:12:37,165
Speaker 2:  that is it for The Vergecast today. Thank you to everyone who's on the show

1056
01:12:37,165 --> 01:12:40,165
Speaker 2:  and thank you as always for listening. There's lots more on everything we

1057
01:12:40,165 --> 01:12:42,805
Speaker 2:  talked about all of Thomas Riker's reviews, Andrew Marino's, great videos,

1058
01:12:42,995 --> 01:12:46,885
Speaker 2:  lots of stuff that we've done on browsers, all of that, I'll put in the show

1059
01:12:46,885 --> 01:12:50,845
Speaker 2:  notes. But as always, read the website. It's December, but the news keeps

1060
01:12:50,845 --> 01:12:54,605
Speaker 2:  happening. We have tons of great gift guides. Some of the like Cyber Monday,

1061
01:12:54,655 --> 01:12:58,605
Speaker 2:  black Friday deals are still kicking around, so keep it locked on the

1062
01:12:58,605 --> 01:13:01,445
Speaker 2:  website. Lots of good stuff going on. And like I said before, If, you have

1063
01:13:01,445 --> 01:13:05,005
Speaker 2:  thoughts, questions, feelings, or other browsers I should download.

1064
01:13:05,225 --> 01:13:08,605
Speaker 2:  You can always email us at vergecast at The Verge dot com or call the hotline.

1065
01:13:08,635 --> 01:13:12,365
Speaker 2:  It's six six VERGE one one. Like I said, we're doing a meta episode

1066
01:13:12,375 --> 01:13:15,885
Speaker 2:  about all things VERGE and vergecast in the future of media and podcasts

1067
01:13:15,885 --> 01:13:18,925
Speaker 2:  and whatever else you wanna talk about next Tuesday. So getting our questions

1068
01:13:18,945 --> 01:13:22,045
Speaker 2:  as soon as you can and we will answer as many of them on the show as we possibly

1069
01:13:22,045 --> 01:13:25,925
Speaker 2:  can. This show is produced by Liam James Wil Pour and Eric Gomez.

1070
01:13:26,185 --> 01:13:29,165
Speaker 2:  The Vergecast is a VERGE production and part of the Vox Media podcast network.

1071
01:13:29,715 --> 01:13:32,965
Speaker 2:  Neli and I'll be back on Friday to talk about all the news,
