Description: It's been a busy week for The Verge's product reviewers! We've got three new phones, three new watches, and a set of earbuds on the docket, and the team is ready to talk about (almost) all of it. First, Allison Johnson and Jake Kastrenakes join to talk about their experiences with the iPhone Air, iPhone 17, and iPhone 17 Pro. One is fabulous with some compromises, one is just a down-the-middle excellent phone, and the other is for camera nerds. After that, Victoria Song talks about the AirPods Pro 3, which are also a stellar upgrade, and then helps us make sense of the new lineup of Apple Watches. There's the SE 3, the Series 11, and the Ultra 3, but there's only one clear winner for most people. Finally, we answer a question from the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about Apple's up-and-down focus on AI

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,845
Speaker 1:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of phones that look like

3
00:00:03,845 --> 00:00:07,365
Speaker 1:  Phones. I'm your friend David Pierce, And I am decluttering

4
00:00:08,205 --> 00:00:11,885
Speaker 1:  starting to anyway, so it looks like my wife And I are gonna be moving at

5
00:00:11,885 --> 00:00:15,685
Speaker 1:  the end of October, which means that I have now six weeks

6
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:20,325
Speaker 1:  to get most of the things out of my house. And I would say like, I'm

7
00:00:20,325 --> 00:00:24,245
Speaker 1:  not a pack rat or like a hoarder person in general, but I

8
00:00:24,245 --> 00:00:27,965
Speaker 1:  do accumulate things. Part of that is just the nature of this job.

9
00:00:27,965 --> 00:00:31,325
Speaker 1:  There's a lot of like iPad boxes and random

10
00:00:31,515 --> 00:00:34,805
Speaker 1:  accessories lying around in the basement near me. And a lot of that needs

11
00:00:34,805 --> 00:00:38,645
Speaker 1:  to get shipped and a lot of that needs to get thrown away. But I just,

12
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:43,125
Speaker 1:  I need a moment, like a few times a year to just really be like, okay,

13
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:46,565
Speaker 1:  time to get rid of most of the things that I own. It's a very productive

14
00:00:46,565 --> 00:00:49,525
Speaker 1:  moment. It's a moment I actually really enjoy. I should probably do it more

15
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:53,165
Speaker 1:  often. So I have six weeks now to essentially declutter,

16
00:00:53,355 --> 00:00:57,045
Speaker 1:  pack up and move sometime in the near future. I

17
00:00:57,045 --> 00:01:00,405
Speaker 1:  suspect I'm gonna be doing this podcast from an entirely new place, But that

18
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:04,125
Speaker 1:  is not what we're here to talk about today or any of the days. For the next

19
00:01:04,145 --> 00:01:07,805
Speaker 1:  six weeks, we're here to talk about Apple. So it's Apple

20
00:01:07,865 --> 00:01:10,765
Speaker 1:  Review season. We have lots of new devices. Our team has been testing the

21
00:01:10,765 --> 00:01:14,565
Speaker 1:  new devices and this is one of the most interesting gadget moments of

22
00:01:14,665 --> 00:01:18,605
Speaker 1:  the year. Not necessarily because the Apple products themselves are so interesting,

23
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:22,645
Speaker 1:  but because this is a moment to kind of take stock of the whole gadget

24
00:01:22,655 --> 00:01:26,365
Speaker 1:  world, this isn't the end of gadget season. We're about to have Meta Connect,

25
00:01:26,575 --> 00:01:30,365
Speaker 1:  we're about to have some interesting Amazon hardware news I suspect in a

26
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:33,565
Speaker 1:  couple of weeks. There's a lot of stuff left to come, but this is

27
00:01:34,155 --> 00:01:38,005
Speaker 1:  kind of the end of phone season in a certain way. It's also a good

28
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:41,085
Speaker 1:  time to just take stock of where we are, how Apple is doing,

29
00:01:41,785 --> 00:01:45,525
Speaker 1:  and whether or not any of these gadgets are still moving forward in an

30
00:01:45,685 --> 00:01:47,405
Speaker 1:  interesting way. So that's what we're gonna talk about. We're gonna have

31
00:01:47,405 --> 00:01:51,165
Speaker 1:  Alison Johnson vs. Song and Jake Cast is on. They've been reviewing the devices,

32
00:01:51,165 --> 00:01:54,165
Speaker 1:  they have lots of thoughts. I don't know anything about how they feel about

33
00:01:54,165 --> 00:01:57,725
Speaker 1:  these devices yet, so hopefully we're gonna get some fireworks. All of that

34
00:01:57,745 --> 00:02:01,645
Speaker 1:  is coming up in just a second, but first I just saw like 12 more things that

35
00:02:01,725 --> 00:02:05,565
Speaker 1:  I need to throw away and post for free on Nextdoor. By the way, posting stuff

36
00:02:05,565 --> 00:02:09,505
Speaker 1:  for free on Nextdoor incredible. This is The Vergecast, we'll be

37
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:09,745
Speaker 1:  right back.

38
00:04:16,275 --> 00:04:20,245
Speaker 1:  Jake Kakis is here. Hi Jake. Hey there, Jake, in two weeks

39
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:24,445
Speaker 1:  you have debuted as an Apple Live blogger and you have debuted, I believe,

40
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:25,525
Speaker 1:  as an iPhone reviewer.

41
00:04:25,745 --> 00:04:26,845
Speaker 6:  I'm trying my best, this is

42
00:04:26,845 --> 00:04:27,365
Speaker 1:  Huge for you.

43
00:04:27,555 --> 00:04:29,005
Speaker 6:  Yeah, no, this is great. What

44
00:04:29,005 --> 00:04:30,285
Speaker 1:  A glow up for Jake this year.

45
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:34,205
Speaker 6:  They, I know, it's fun. It's, you know, due to

46
00:04:34,885 --> 00:04:38,765
Speaker 6:  everyone else being unavailable, a lot of people thought really hard

47
00:04:38,765 --> 00:04:42,645
Speaker 6:  and said, I, I guess, I guess Jake is available. And

48
00:04:42,665 --> 00:04:46,005
Speaker 6:  that's how I got The Vergecast hosting gig. That's how I got The iPhone reviewing

49
00:04:46,005 --> 00:04:46,205
Speaker 6:  gig.

50
00:04:46,525 --> 00:04:49,965
Speaker 1:  I mean, honestly, this is, this is the life. So if I have this right, Jake,

51
00:04:50,065 --> 00:04:53,765
Speaker 1:  you reviewed the base iPhone 17. Yes. And

52
00:04:53,765 --> 00:04:57,445
Speaker 1:  Allison, you have some or all of the phones, but you've mostly

53
00:04:57,475 --> 00:05:00,125
Speaker 1:  been doing The iPhone air review, right? Yeah,

54
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:02,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Okay. That's been my main gig.

55
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:06,685
Speaker 1:  Okay. So this is good because I actually think, and, and

56
00:05:06,985 --> 00:05:10,685
Speaker 1:  you should both feel free to tell me I'm wrong and correct me, I think you

57
00:05:10,765 --> 00:05:12,525
Speaker 1:  have the two most interesting phones of the year

58
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:18,165
Speaker 1:  by a mile, but for wildly different reasons and we should just get into it.

59
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:22,165
Speaker 1:  So I think we have to start with the air, which I think is probably the

60
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:26,085
Speaker 1:  phone about which I have the most questions, if that makes sense. Like it

61
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:30,045
Speaker 1:  is, it is the wildest of the wild cards of these

62
00:05:30,045 --> 00:05:34,005
Speaker 1:  phones so far. So Alison, you've been using the thing, you've reviewed the

63
00:05:34,005 --> 00:05:34,165
Speaker 1:  thing,

64
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,825
Speaker 1:  hit me with it. How do you feel? How's the, how's The iPhone air experience

65
00:05:38,825 --> 00:05:39,025
Speaker 1:  been?

66
00:05:39,895 --> 00:05:43,755
Speaker 5:  Oh boy. I feel, I feel pretty much

67
00:05:44,065 --> 00:05:47,595
Speaker 5:  like I anticipated I would, so I should say that I reviewed

68
00:05:47,975 --> 00:05:51,955
Speaker 5:  the Samsung Galaxy S 25 Edge earlier this year. It's kind

69
00:05:51,955 --> 00:05:54,915
Speaker 5:  of the same idea. It's a phone except thin.

70
00:05:56,695 --> 00:06:00,525
Speaker 5:  And the experience of using that and The iPhone air

71
00:06:01,385 --> 00:06:05,165
Speaker 5:  is, you're sort of wowed right at the beginning.

72
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:08,365
Speaker 5:  You're like, oh my God, this is so thin, it's so light, I feel like I'm gonna

73
00:06:08,365 --> 00:06:11,965
Speaker 5:  break it. You get used to that. You carry it around and

74
00:06:12,265 --> 00:06:16,005
Speaker 5:  the thing that kind of sticks with you is the weight. Like

75
00:06:16,135 --> 00:06:20,085
Speaker 5:  it'll fit into pockets and little nooks and crannies of the

76
00:06:20,085 --> 00:06:23,645
Speaker 5:  bags. I carry that. Normally I'm like trying to jam a phone into,

77
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:27,085
Speaker 5:  and every time it does that, I'm like, oh, that was nice.

78
00:06:28,665 --> 00:06:32,605
Speaker 5:  But, but the thing that kind of sticks with me is just sitting

79
00:06:32,665 --> 00:06:36,645
Speaker 5:  and holding it and scrolling and my hand doesn't get as tired

80
00:06:37,145 --> 00:06:40,845
Speaker 5:  And I don't have such a great weight resting on my

81
00:06:41,015 --> 00:06:44,965
Speaker 5:  pinky. You know, it's, it's, it's the little things. It's hard

82
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:48,845
Speaker 5:  to describe it and convey it without someone picking it up and holding

83
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:52,565
Speaker 5:  it. If, if you can do that, I encourage you to, but that's

84
00:06:52,765 --> 00:06:53,525
Speaker 5:  my big takeaway.

85
00:06:53,675 --> 00:06:56,445
Speaker 1:  This is one of the challenges of this phone, right? Is I think like you,

86
00:06:56,445 --> 00:07:00,365
Speaker 1:  you look at the specs and like, yeah, it's thinner and yeah, it's

87
00:07:00,365 --> 00:07:04,285
Speaker 1:  lighter, but the numbers are relatively small

88
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:08,125
Speaker 1:  to the extent it's not like, you know, the, the regular iPhone weighs six

89
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:12,085
Speaker 1:  pounds and this is suddenly much smaller. Like it's just a

90
00:07:12,205 --> 00:07:15,525
Speaker 1:  slightly smaller iPhone. But you're saying it, the, the difference is there

91
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:17,565
Speaker 1:  do add up to something meaningful.

92
00:07:17,995 --> 00:07:21,685
Speaker 5:  They do. And I, I went through the same thing. You look at the numbers, you're

93
00:07:21,685 --> 00:07:25,205
Speaker 5:  like, is this really gonna be that big of a difference? And you pick it up

94
00:07:25,205 --> 00:07:29,125
Speaker 5:  and hold it, you're like, oh, it really is. And I think it

95
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:32,845
Speaker 5:  just comes down to, we are so attuned to like every gram

96
00:07:33,195 --> 00:07:36,965
Speaker 5:  that a phone weighs. 'cause we carry them and use them all the time.

97
00:07:37,065 --> 00:07:40,925
Speaker 5:  And there's just sort of a, we've settled on like, this is roughly how much

98
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:44,205
Speaker 5:  a phone weighs and you pick this one up and you're like, oh,

99
00:07:44,955 --> 00:07:48,925
Speaker 5:  it's, I don't know. Okay. I do know you have had this

100
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:52,885
Speaker 5:  experience of like picking up a toddler like day after day

101
00:07:52,945 --> 00:07:56,725
Speaker 5:  and you're like so used to how heavy they are. Then you pick up a newborn,

102
00:07:56,725 --> 00:07:59,445
Speaker 5:  you're like, oh my God, I'm gonna like

103
00:08:00,715 --> 00:08:04,485
Speaker 5:  toss this child into the air. Same deal. It's like

104
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,085
Speaker 5:  toddlers.

105
00:08:05,765 --> 00:08:09,605
Speaker 1:  Interesting. So this really pours cold water on a theory I've had for a long

106
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:12,445
Speaker 1:  time, which is that actually what I want apple to do is make a bigger phone

107
00:08:12,835 --> 00:08:16,485
Speaker 1:  with like bruising battery life. And that is

108
00:08:16,485 --> 00:08:20,045
Speaker 1:  completely indestructible. And actually what you're making me think is maybe

109
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:23,765
Speaker 1:  the lesson learned here is that that actually isn't a good idea because we're

110
00:08:23,765 --> 00:08:27,605
Speaker 1:  so attuned to it that if you made it bigger, it would, it

111
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:31,005
Speaker 1:  wouldn't just feel not better. It would feel like actively worse.

112
00:08:31,675 --> 00:08:35,205
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And I will add to that. So, you know,

113
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:38,885
Speaker 5:  spoiler alert, battery life is not super great on the air. We sort of

114
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:39,565
Speaker 5:  anticipated that

115
00:08:41,115 --> 00:08:45,085
Speaker 5:  it's not a disaster, but there's the, the MagSafe

116
00:08:45,085 --> 00:08:49,045
Speaker 5:  battery pack that apple kind of reintroduced, like specifically

117
00:08:49,065 --> 00:08:49,565
Speaker 5:  for the air.

118
00:08:49,675 --> 00:08:52,725
Speaker 1:  Jake was very excited about this on the podcast last week. Oh yeah. Jake

119
00:08:52,725 --> 00:08:54,565
Speaker 1:  loves a battery pack. Yeah, I love it.

120
00:08:54,675 --> 00:08:57,045
Speaker 6:  Love, love making a phone bigger with more accessories.

121
00:08:57,315 --> 00:09:00,645
Speaker 5:  Well, that's the thing, it's like, you can think of it as a modular phone

122
00:09:00,655 --> 00:09:04,565
Speaker 5:  where you're like, this is kind of how it is by itself. But then

123
00:09:04,565 --> 00:09:08,525
Speaker 5:  you slap a battery pack on it. But the, the thing

124
00:09:08,525 --> 00:09:12,405
Speaker 5:  is it, the battery pack itself, it light and thin. You put it on the

125
00:09:12,405 --> 00:09:15,885
Speaker 5:  phone and you use it for a minute and I'm like, this is too heavy. Like this

126
00:09:15,885 --> 00:09:19,845
Speaker 5:  is heavier than a pro. Interesting. It doesn't feel good And I just wanna

127
00:09:19,845 --> 00:09:22,525
Speaker 5:  leave it here until it's charged and then take this thing off of it.

128
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:26,645
Speaker 1:  Yeah. There, there's definitely a real, like, we keep telling people go like,

129
00:09:26,655 --> 00:09:29,045
Speaker 1:  touch it and try it and pick it up. And part of me is like, that might actually

130
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:32,845
Speaker 1:  be terrible advice because like, maybe you shouldn't know how much

131
00:09:32,845 --> 00:09:35,565
Speaker 1:  thinner and lighter your phone could be unless you're prepared to spend the

132
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:36,725
Speaker 1:  money on the thinner and lighter phone.

133
00:09:37,145 --> 00:09:41,045
Speaker 5:  You know, the reaction I've gotten, it's kind of a negative one at first,

134
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:44,845
Speaker 5:  I think from people who are not really expecting, like my husband, he's like,

135
00:09:45,345 --> 00:09:48,765
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna break this. I don't like that. Like, I heard that a couple of times

136
00:09:49,585 --> 00:09:53,165
Speaker 5:  and then after you've used it a little bit, you're like, okay, okay, I feel

137
00:09:53,165 --> 00:09:55,085
Speaker 5:  better with this. This is, this is nice.

138
00:09:55,955 --> 00:09:57,565
Speaker 1:  Does it feel fragile at all?

139
00:09:58,205 --> 00:10:01,485
Speaker 5:  I wouldn't say it does. Like, it, it feels solid. I,

140
00:10:03,325 --> 00:10:06,605
Speaker 5:  I did have it like sitting on the ground and my

141
00:10:07,075 --> 00:10:10,845
Speaker 5:  4-year-old was like stomping around the room And I had to like,

142
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:14,845
Speaker 5:  ooh, I hope he doesn't stomp right in the middle of his phone. Like,

143
00:10:15,205 --> 00:10:18,885
Speaker 5:  I would not normally think that of a, of a

144
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:22,845
Speaker 5:  normal phone. But it's, it's something that sort of crossed

145
00:10:22,845 --> 00:10:26,685
Speaker 5:  my mind more often using this. But at

146
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:30,565
Speaker 5:  no point was I like, thi this feels so fragile,

147
00:10:30,985 --> 00:10:31,645
Speaker 5:  I'm gonna break it.

148
00:10:31,915 --> 00:10:35,565
Speaker 1:  Okay, that's good news. I'm, I'm glad to hear that. 'cause I think, yeah,

149
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:39,045
Speaker 1:  one of my worries would be that I would end up treating this thing like a

150
00:10:39,245 --> 00:10:42,605
Speaker 1:  precious object because they kind of want you to think it is a precious object

151
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:46,725
Speaker 1:  and that's just not the right relationship to have with your

152
00:10:46,725 --> 00:10:50,685
Speaker 1:  phone. I think like these things are so utilitarian and so ubiquitous

153
00:10:50,685 --> 00:10:54,365
Speaker 1:  that having something you have to baby is actually really annoying

154
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,405
Speaker 1:  in my humble opinion. But you mentioned battery life And I think the, the

155
00:10:58,405 --> 00:11:01,805
Speaker 1:  two trade-offs we expected coming into this, were going to be battery life

156
00:11:01,945 --> 00:11:05,525
Speaker 1:  and camera question mark, because there's only one

157
00:11:06,305 --> 00:11:10,245
Speaker 1:  and we have a lot of thoughts about it. Let's start with battery life. What's

158
00:11:10,245 --> 00:11:12,405
Speaker 1:  the, what's the actual situation like

159
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:16,605
Speaker 5:  Battery life? Where I've landed is, and

160
00:11:16,605 --> 00:11:20,565
Speaker 5:  I've only used a thing for a week, but it seems to

161
00:11:20,565 --> 00:11:24,405
Speaker 5:  me it's in, if there's a spectrum of like spectrum acceptable

162
00:11:24,405 --> 00:11:28,205
Speaker 5:  battery life on a brand new phone, it's in that

163
00:11:28,725 --> 00:11:32,605
Speaker 5:  spectrum. It's on the low end. Okay. So depending

164
00:11:32,605 --> 00:11:35,485
Speaker 5:  on the phone you're, you're trading in. Wait,

165
00:11:35,505 --> 00:11:37,565
Speaker 1:  Can I just pause you? Actually this is, this is, can we just do a little

166
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:41,645
Speaker 1:  exercise right now? Okay. I want all three of us to just say out

167
00:11:41,805 --> 00:11:45,565
Speaker 1:  loud what you think minimum acceptable battery life

168
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:49,485
Speaker 1:  is for a smartphone. Like how often do you need to charge your phone

169
00:11:51,155 --> 00:11:52,815
Speaker 1:  in order for it to be fine?

170
00:11:54,345 --> 00:11:55,155
Speaker 1:  Jake, you go first.

171
00:11:55,655 --> 00:11:59,435
Speaker 6:  So my current phone that I, that I use day to day is a pixel eight. Okay.

172
00:12:00,335 --> 00:12:04,275
Speaker 6:  And if it hits 20%, it goes into low power mode

173
00:12:04,495 --> 00:12:07,435
Speaker 6:  and it drives me crazy 'cause it turns the high refresh rate screen off.

174
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,915
Speaker 6:  Everything goes into dark mode. Everything gets chugged, you know, starts

175
00:12:10,915 --> 00:12:11,515
Speaker 6:  slowing down.

176
00:12:13,135 --> 00:12:16,435
Speaker 6:  If it hits 20% and I'm in my day to day,

177
00:12:16,775 --> 00:12:20,635
Speaker 6:  that's when it's too low. Mm. So I, I think bare

178
00:12:20,635 --> 00:12:24,475
Speaker 6:  minimum is a phone that is above 20% power

179
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:25,755
Speaker 6:  when I go to bed.

180
00:12:26,825 --> 00:12:29,835
Speaker 1:  Okay. I like that. Alison, what's, what do you feel like your number is?

181
00:12:30,425 --> 00:12:34,355
Speaker 5:  Yeah, about the same. Like, I, I need to get through my day

182
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:38,995
Speaker 5:  and if I see that 20%, you know, it turns red,

183
00:12:39,215 --> 00:12:42,475
Speaker 5:  it gives you a a mean notifications. Like

184
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:45,435
Speaker 1:  Yeah. The iPhone really gets really alarming about it when you get 20%

185
00:12:45,975 --> 00:12:49,755
Speaker 5:  And every time I look at the phone, you know, you see the, the percentage

186
00:12:49,815 --> 00:12:53,675
Speaker 5:  go down and it's still angry at you. So Yeah. I, I agree with

187
00:12:53,675 --> 00:12:53,835
Speaker 5:  that.

188
00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:57,115
Speaker 1:  Okay. It's, it's funny, I actually think we're all almost in exactly the

189
00:12:57,115 --> 00:12:59,555
Speaker 1:  same place, which is really helpful. So I, the reason I ask is because I've

190
00:12:59,555 --> 00:13:03,475
Speaker 1:  been using the iOS 26 betas all summer and like beta software is

191
00:13:03,475 --> 00:13:07,195
Speaker 1:  famously just crushing to phones. So like, I don't hold it against the

192
00:13:07,325 --> 00:13:11,115
Speaker 1:  betas when they crush my phone's battery, but they have, and so

193
00:13:11,145 --> 00:13:15,035
Speaker 1:  I've gotten to the point where now I'm getting to 20% at like

194
00:13:15,905 --> 00:13:19,875
Speaker 1:  four o'clock in the afternoon. Mm. And like the difference

195
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:23,195
Speaker 1:  that that makes in like my psyche is so much more

196
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:27,355
Speaker 1:  substantial than I am willing to talk about like that that

197
00:13:27,355 --> 00:13:31,035
Speaker 1:  feeling of like, okay, I ha I am, I have to run out to do an errand

198
00:13:31,335 --> 00:13:34,795
Speaker 1:  and there's like an actual non-zero chance my phone battery is going to be

199
00:13:34,795 --> 00:13:37,475
Speaker 1:  dead before I get home because I have to use CarPlay to get there. I have

200
00:13:37,535 --> 00:13:40,235
Speaker 1:  my grocery list on my phone And I need to get back. So I'm gonna like use

201
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:43,395
Speaker 1:  this device. It's four 30 in the afternoon And I feel like my phone might

202
00:13:43,395 --> 00:13:47,345
Speaker 1:  be dead before I get home. It's like, that is, that is unacceptable.

203
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:51,265
Speaker 1:  And so I think I, I like the, like I, I should

204
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:54,465
Speaker 1:  be able to charge it every night and never hit low power mode, I think is

205
00:13:54,505 --> 00:13:58,345
Speaker 1:  a really good, a really good way of, of thinking about it. So does,

206
00:13:58,345 --> 00:14:02,105
Speaker 1:  does The iPhone error hit that? Does it at least hit that threshold?

207
00:14:02,485 --> 00:14:05,785
Speaker 5:  It mostly does. So the, the days

208
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:08,105
Speaker 1:  When I, that was a sigh at the beginning of that sentence that I don't like

209
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:08,425
Speaker 1:  at all.

210
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,585
Speaker 5:  It's just testing a battery. There's so many factors

211
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:15,825
Speaker 5:  and so many things. That's true. And especially in a period where you're

212
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:19,425
Speaker 5:  setting up a phone from scratch and using it the first two days are

213
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:23,705
Speaker 5:  just kind of a nightmare. So the days where

214
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:27,425
Speaker 5:  I went really hard on the battery had like a ton of, you know, more than

215
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:31,225
Speaker 5:  five hours of screen on time. I was in the back of an Uber for an

216
00:14:31,225 --> 00:14:35,185
Speaker 5:  hour, all this stuff. Like I was getting to

217
00:14:35,185 --> 00:14:39,105
Speaker 5:  that 20% by dinner time and that was stressing me

218
00:14:39,105 --> 00:14:42,985
Speaker 5:  out. And I was like, do I put the battery pack? Do I charge it? Do I leave

219
00:14:42,985 --> 00:14:44,825
Speaker 5:  the battery pack on while I'm making a phone call?

220
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:50,305
Speaker 5:  I didn't like that when I've had, and that was a lot more

221
00:14:51,025 --> 00:14:54,965
Speaker 5:  out and about and travel when I've been at home on wifi and I'm

222
00:14:54,965 --> 00:14:58,845
Speaker 5:  just kind of doing normal stuff and it's more like of a three hours

223
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:00,405
Speaker 5:  of screen on time day.

224
00:15:02,155 --> 00:15:05,605
Speaker 5:  It's been much more acceptable where it's in the

225
00:15:06,765 --> 00:15:08,005
Speaker 5:  thirties by bedtime,

226
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:13,685
Speaker 5:  so didn't see the low power mode. I breathe the sigh of

227
00:15:13,685 --> 00:15:16,965
Speaker 5:  relief. But, but for a brand new phone

228
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:21,865
Speaker 5:  that does not feel great, you know? Yeah. That, and that's the kind of thing

229
00:15:21,865 --> 00:15:25,785
Speaker 5:  that's like, this is the best this battery's gonna be. It is not gonna ever

230
00:15:25,785 --> 00:15:29,705
Speaker 5:  be any better. And a year from now, what's

231
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:30,825
Speaker 5:  that gonna look like? You know?

232
00:15:31,215 --> 00:15:34,585
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Jake, that description of the battery sounds like it does not hit my

233
00:15:34,825 --> 00:15:36,185
Speaker 1:  threshold. Does it hit yours? No,

234
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,665
Speaker 6:  I agree with you. Okay. 'cause that, that's exactly where my 2-year-old phone

235
00:15:39,665 --> 00:15:43,505
Speaker 6:  is. Right. If I push it hard, I'm gonna see lower power mode on a normal

236
00:15:43,565 --> 00:15:47,425
Speaker 6:  day it's winding down, but it's fine. But that's fine. It's two years

237
00:15:47,425 --> 00:15:50,955
Speaker 6:  old. You gotta worry. I, that, that makes me concerned about

238
00:15:51,255 --> 00:15:52,475
Speaker 6:  how that's gonna be in the long term.

239
00:15:53,025 --> 00:15:56,985
Speaker 1:  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And this is like, if, if you're not gonna hold

240
00:15:56,985 --> 00:16:00,505
Speaker 1:  and look at your phone, the hell's the point of buying the fancy one. You

241
00:16:00,505 --> 00:16:03,385
Speaker 1:  know what I mean? I don't think, like, I just don't think The iPhone air

242
00:16:03,385 --> 00:16:07,345
Speaker 1:  is like the, the gentle user's iPhone to begin with.

243
00:16:07,705 --> 00:16:11,465
Speaker 1:  So I think it's, it's a tricky, like the, the self-selecting group of people

244
00:16:11,485 --> 00:16:15,185
Speaker 1:  who is going to buy this phone are going to be be the people who maybe are

245
00:16:15,185 --> 00:16:19,145
Speaker 1:  hit the hardest by the battery limitations. But to some

246
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,825
Speaker 1:  extent that's physics, right? Like it is what it is. I don't, I don't know

247
00:16:21,825 --> 00:16:25,625
Speaker 1:  how much there actually is to do to solve it. Like

248
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:29,585
Speaker 1:  there's only so much space inside of the phone. The camera is the other one.

249
00:16:29,585 --> 00:16:31,065
Speaker 1:  What's, what's been your verdict on the camera?

250
00:16:31,485 --> 00:16:35,345
Speaker 5:  The camera. I'm a little more okay with, with the

251
00:16:35,345 --> 00:16:38,905
Speaker 5:  asterisk that you know, it, it is a single 48

252
00:16:38,935 --> 00:16:42,665
Speaker 5:  megapixel camera. Very capable in good

253
00:16:42,665 --> 00:16:46,585
Speaker 5:  light. You know, it's hard to buy a phone with a bad camera these days.

254
00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:52,025
Speaker 5:  You do get like a two times crop zoom

255
00:16:52,335 --> 00:16:56,185
Speaker 5:  mode. You get the new selfie camera on the front.

256
00:16:56,335 --> 00:16:58,625
Speaker 5:  Very. Which is very cool and nice. Does that

257
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:02,345
Speaker 1:  Work by the way? Just random digression Does it, does the, the thing where

258
00:17:02,345 --> 00:17:05,265
Speaker 1:  it, it'll do the landscape selfies. It'll do the crop selfies 'cause it has

259
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:07,705
Speaker 1:  the square sensor. Like does that all work as advertised?

260
00:17:08,165 --> 00:17:12,065
Speaker 5:  It does. You need, the thing we learned is that you need

261
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:15,905
Speaker 5:  at least four people in the frame, like moving into the frame and

262
00:17:15,905 --> 00:17:19,265
Speaker 5:  looking at the camera to trigger it where it's gonna go.

263
00:17:19,575 --> 00:17:20,385
Speaker 5:  Landscape mode,

264
00:17:22,195 --> 00:17:23,265
Speaker 5:  which makes me take

265
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:24,545
Speaker 1:  Selfies with that many people.

266
00:17:24,985 --> 00:17:25,585
Speaker 5:  I don't know. I'm

267
00:17:25,585 --> 00:17:27,105
Speaker 1:  Like, I don't have that many friends. What

268
00:17:27,105 --> 00:17:30,745
Speaker 5:  Are we doing? I don't have many friends. Like what? Yeah. Kind of rude of

269
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:34,475
Speaker 5:  Apple. Seriously. But it is cool. It does some cool stuff,

270
00:17:34,895 --> 00:17:38,435
Speaker 5:  but the, the thing I miss on the air is the Ultra wide,

271
00:17:40,135 --> 00:17:44,075
Speaker 5:  you know, the Samsung Edge has and Ultra wide it is

272
00:17:44,115 --> 00:17:48,075
Speaker 5:  a little bit thicker and bigger, but that's

273
00:17:48,075 --> 00:17:51,805
Speaker 5:  just one of those things you can't, like computational photography,

274
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:55,285
Speaker 5:  you're way out of like, if I can't back up in a room, that's it.

275
00:17:55,735 --> 00:17:59,325
Speaker 5:  Right? You're just doing one of these where you're like leaning all the way

276
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:02,685
Speaker 5:  back. So there's a few situations you get into where

277
00:18:03,545 --> 00:18:06,565
Speaker 5:  I'm like, this is, this is a thousand dollars phone And I can't do this.

278
00:18:06,635 --> 00:18:08,485
Speaker 5:  This doesn't feel quite right.

279
00:18:08,995 --> 00:18:12,445
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Yeah. And, and those, those trade offs are always easier to stomach

280
00:18:12,445 --> 00:18:15,245
Speaker 1:  when you're paying less money. This is like what we talked about last week

281
00:18:15,245 --> 00:18:17,605
Speaker 1:  with the, the folding and flipping phones. It's like, it's one thing to be

282
00:18:17,605 --> 00:18:21,445
Speaker 1:  like, oh, you get fewer cameras for fewer dollars, that makes sense. But

283
00:18:21,445 --> 00:18:25,125
Speaker 1:  here is the expensive one, it does less stuff. And you're like, well that

284
00:18:25,635 --> 00:18:29,485
Speaker 1:  doesn't compute quite the same way in round. Yeah. Jake, you've,

285
00:18:29,485 --> 00:18:32,605
Speaker 1:  you've also gotten to use the selfie camera and you as everyone knows, are

286
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,645
Speaker 1:  the most prone selfie taker at The Verge. I would say

287
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:36,925
Speaker 6:  Nonstop. Nonstop.

288
00:18:36,925 --> 00:18:39,525
Speaker 1:  If you put, if you were like, who is taking the pictures of themselves the

289
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:42,125
Speaker 1:  most often it's Jake And I, it's not close. What?

290
00:18:42,445 --> 00:18:45,685
Speaker 6:  I have a ring light set up in every room just in case I need to take some

291
00:18:45,685 --> 00:18:45,885
Speaker 6:  photos.

292
00:18:46,265 --> 00:18:48,605
Speaker 1:  You just have one attached, like with a chest strap at all times.

293
00:18:48,945 --> 00:18:52,245
Speaker 6:  I'm constantly slacking you these photos when I'm cooking dinner. Yeah.

294
00:18:53,105 --> 00:18:55,565
Speaker 1:  How have, have you found the, the new selfie camp? Because it's the same

295
00:18:55,585 --> 00:18:56,805
Speaker 1:  one across all the models, right?

296
00:18:57,235 --> 00:19:01,205
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah. So it, it's interesting. I I did side by sides with the 17

297
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:05,165
Speaker 6:  and the 16 and quality wise, the,

298
00:19:05,165 --> 00:19:08,645
Speaker 6:  the selfies look identical, right? Like, I, I don't think a lot has changed

299
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:12,165
Speaker 6:  in the character of the selfies. It really just is this trick

300
00:19:12,415 --> 00:19:16,405
Speaker 6:  where it just goes sideways automatically for you. You don't have to it.

301
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:20,925
Speaker 6:  I, I'm a little torn, like on one hand, I, I did not personally

302
00:19:20,925 --> 00:19:24,885
Speaker 6:  find turning my phone sideways to take a landscape selfie, all that difficult.

303
00:19:25,305 --> 00:19:29,135
Speaker 6:  On the other hand, selfies by

304
00:19:29,155 --> 00:19:32,735
Speaker 6:  far are shot in portrait, right? People are holding their phone

305
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:37,015
Speaker 6:  upright and Apple has now made it easier to get everybody in the

306
00:19:37,015 --> 00:19:40,855
Speaker 6:  frame while you're doing that. They have fully dummy proofed the selfie and

307
00:19:40,975 --> 00:19:44,795
Speaker 6:  you know what? It works. So I, I don't think this is

308
00:19:44,795 --> 00:19:47,875
Speaker 6:  going to be necessarily like revolutionary for everybody. I don't think your

309
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:51,475
Speaker 6:  selfies are gonna look better. Is it gonna make it slightly easier for a

310
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:53,995
Speaker 6:  lot of people to take selfies? Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.

311
00:19:54,355 --> 00:19:57,795
Speaker 1:  I think dummy proof is like the story of the iPhones camera

312
00:19:58,175 --> 00:20:01,355
Speaker 1:  as we've, you know, talked about many times. It is, their whole thing is

313
00:20:01,355 --> 00:20:04,795
Speaker 1:  basically how do we make it harder to take bad pictures? Which I think is

314
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,475
Speaker 1:  a good and noble goal, but is maybe not the only goal that a camera manufacturer

315
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:08,915
Speaker 1:  should have.

316
00:20:09,715 --> 00:20:13,355
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I mean, if, if you're a person who wants to take creative photos or,

317
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:16,355
Speaker 6:  or you know, quote unquote great photos, it's, you know, maybe it's not what

318
00:20:16,355 --> 00:20:19,475
Speaker 6:  you want. But I, I do think, you know,

319
00:20:20,005 --> 00:20:23,995
Speaker 6:  we've been doing selfie cameras for little over a decade now and this is

320
00:20:23,995 --> 00:20:27,515
Speaker 6:  the first time I can really think of a, a major phone being like, Hey, maybe

321
00:20:27,575 --> 00:20:30,915
Speaker 6:  we should optimize for the main way that people shoot selfies.

322
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:33,475
Speaker 6:  You know what? That makes a lot of sense. Yeah,

323
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:38,075
Speaker 1:  I buy it. So Alison, just to cover off on the, on the air here, where, where

324
00:20:38,075 --> 00:20:41,475
Speaker 1:  do you land in terms of like, I'm just a person,

325
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:45,275
Speaker 1:  I have an, I don't know, I have an iPhone 13 that is like on its last legs,

326
00:20:46,035 --> 00:20:50,005
Speaker 1:  it's time for me to upgrade and I'm just earnestly

327
00:20:50,005 --> 00:20:53,645
Speaker 1:  trying to decide which iPhone to buy. I'm not like coming to it with any

328
00:20:53,925 --> 00:20:57,685
Speaker 1:  preconceived notions. Who is the heir the right phone

329
00:20:57,705 --> 00:20:57,925
Speaker 1:  for,

330
00:20:58,475 --> 00:21:02,165
Speaker 5:  This is a, a weird one. So if you have an iPhone

331
00:21:02,485 --> 00:21:06,445
Speaker 5:  13, I would infer about you that you like

332
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:10,245
Speaker 5:  to hold onto your phone. You don't wanna be going into an Apple store

333
00:21:10,245 --> 00:21:13,565
Speaker 5:  every two years and be like, I'll take the new iPhone please.

334
00:21:14,945 --> 00:21:18,845
Speaker 5:  The iPhone here is not for that person. I think the battery is

335
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:20,165
Speaker 5:  gonna run down faster.

336
00:21:22,525 --> 00:21:25,765
Speaker 5:  I I think you're just gonna run up against the limits

337
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:30,325
Speaker 5:  of what it can do sooner, I think, than

338
00:21:30,405 --> 00:21:32,845
Speaker 5:  a pro or maybe even the regular.

339
00:21:34,265 --> 00:21:37,725
Speaker 5:  So this doesn't feel like a phone for a person who wants to kind of

340
00:21:38,185 --> 00:21:39,005
Speaker 5:  set it and forget it.

341
00:21:40,745 --> 00:21:44,645
Speaker 5:  The way I've come around to thinking about it is that it's a

342
00:21:44,645 --> 00:21:48,605
Speaker 5:  little bit of a statement. It's sort of for a person who's like,

343
00:21:49,345 --> 00:21:53,205
Speaker 5:  you know what, phones are huge. I don't need all that. I don't like all that.

344
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:57,245
Speaker 5:  I would just rather exist with a smaller, lighter phone.

345
00:21:57,905 --> 00:22:01,805
Speaker 5:  I'm fine having this battery pack on me all

346
00:22:01,805 --> 00:22:05,405
Speaker 5:  the time. Or I am always near a power

347
00:22:05,405 --> 00:22:09,165
Speaker 5:  outlet and it's not a problem to just, you know, top off the battery

348
00:22:09,165 --> 00:22:10,005
Speaker 5:  throughout the day.

349
00:22:11,795 --> 00:22:15,605
Speaker 5:  It's kind of a, a leisurely comfortable

350
00:22:15,705 --> 00:22:18,245
Speaker 5:  way to live with your phone. I think there

351
00:22:18,245 --> 00:22:21,765
Speaker 1:  Is a cohort of iPhone mini loving people who are

352
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:25,925
Speaker 1:  screaming at their headphones right now saying, you just described the

353
00:22:25,925 --> 00:22:29,005
Speaker 1:  reason they should have kept making the mini. I know. And to all of those

354
00:22:29,005 --> 00:22:30,205
Speaker 1:  people just know that I agree

355
00:22:30,205 --> 00:22:33,925
Speaker 5:  With you. I know. And he, to to my iPhone mini

356
00:22:34,755 --> 00:22:38,325
Speaker 5:  friends. This is not a small phone. It is

357
00:22:38,765 --> 00:22:42,525
Speaker 5:  a big phone with small phone energy. It is still like, oh, I like that

358
00:22:42,585 --> 00:22:46,205
Speaker 5:  you still have to reach across the screen. It's lighter, it feels nicer in

359
00:22:46,205 --> 00:22:50,085
Speaker 5:  that way. I can fit it in the front pocket of my jeans, which is how I

360
00:22:50,085 --> 00:22:53,885
Speaker 5:  carry my iPhone mini. But it's just, it's not a small phone.

361
00:22:54,025 --> 00:22:56,285
Speaker 5:  So I'm sorry for everybody.

362
00:22:56,715 --> 00:22:59,965
Speaker 1:  Yeah, that's fair. Big phone with small phone energy is is actually I think

363
00:22:59,965 --> 00:23:03,645
Speaker 1:  a very good way to think about it. But yeah, I I think it's going to be interesting

364
00:23:03,645 --> 00:23:07,445
Speaker 1:  to see how many people are willing to make

365
00:23:07,465 --> 00:23:10,365
Speaker 1:  the particular sacrifices you have to make. I think especially on battery

366
00:23:10,395 --> 00:23:13,765
Speaker 1:  life in order to get the size and shape of the thing. And

367
00:23:15,445 --> 00:23:18,925
Speaker 1:  I have not yet bought an iPhone this year. There's, there's always still

368
00:23:18,925 --> 00:23:22,805
Speaker 1:  time, but I need, I need to hold the air before I make a

369
00:23:22,965 --> 00:23:25,765
Speaker 1:  decision on whether it's time to get rid of the 16 and move up.

370
00:23:26,115 --> 00:23:27,125
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Alright, so

371
00:23:27,145 --> 00:23:30,085
Speaker 1:  Now let's, let's switch gears to you, Jake, because I think

372
00:23:31,165 --> 00:23:34,855
Speaker 1:  this year, for the first time in a while, my

373
00:23:34,855 --> 00:23:38,135
Speaker 1:  sense coming out of the event was that the base

374
00:23:38,955 --> 00:23:42,935
Speaker 1:  iPhone was going to be the right iPhone for most people. In, in that

375
00:23:42,935 --> 00:23:46,685
Speaker 1:  same, like, I'm just looking to upgrade my phone. I have no preconceived

376
00:23:46,685 --> 00:23:50,525
Speaker 1:  notions, I just want a good iPhone. The 17 looked

377
00:23:50,525 --> 00:23:54,325
Speaker 1:  coming out like it had all the right upgrades. The price was good. It seemed

378
00:23:54,325 --> 00:23:57,925
Speaker 1:  like it, it was, it was closer to being the one than it has been in a while.

379
00:23:59,285 --> 00:24:01,625
Speaker 1:  How does it feel after testing? Is that, is that still where you land?

380
00:24:02,205 --> 00:24:05,905
Speaker 6:  Oh yeah. I, I tried living with The iPhone 16 for a week

381
00:24:05,965 --> 00:24:09,745
Speaker 6:  before I reviewed the 17 and it was driving

382
00:24:09,805 --> 00:24:13,345
Speaker 6:  me crazy. Right? The, the always on

383
00:24:13,605 --> 00:24:17,465
Speaker 6:  screen is such a dramatic essential

384
00:24:17,695 --> 00:24:21,465
Speaker 6:  upgrade. So it, it's such a critical part of a phone that it, it's kind

385
00:24:21,865 --> 00:24:25,585
Speaker 6:  of bamboozling that it has not been part of the standard

386
00:24:25,685 --> 00:24:29,145
Speaker 6:  iPhone for so long. Right. It debuted on the pro in

387
00:24:29,145 --> 00:24:33,105
Speaker 6:  2022. And you know, it, the reason it's remained a

388
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:36,065
Speaker 6:  pro exclusive until now is 'cause it's, it's a major selling point. And I

389
00:24:36,065 --> 00:24:39,985
Speaker 6:  think it's so major that the past several years, I, I would've told anybody

390
00:24:39,985 --> 00:24:43,585
Speaker 6:  like, yeah, like the pro is, that's so important.

391
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:47,305
Speaker 6:  You should spend money in the pro now there's a $300 price gap

392
00:24:47,765 --> 00:24:50,185
Speaker 6:  and you're getting the best features. You're getting the always on display

393
00:24:50,645 --> 00:24:54,225
Speaker 6:  and it's a high refresh rate screen. It feels like a completely different

394
00:24:54,225 --> 00:24:55,705
Speaker 6:  phone than iPhone 16. Yeah. It

395
00:24:55,705 --> 00:24:59,425
Speaker 1:  Feels like in terms of sort of obviously great things,

396
00:24:59,645 --> 00:25:00,465
Speaker 1:  it doesn't do,

397
00:25:02,595 --> 00:25:06,295
Speaker 1:  the only real thing I can think of is the camera, right? Like are there,

398
00:25:06,315 --> 00:25:08,575
Speaker 1:  are there sort of big things you feel like it's still missing?

399
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:11,895
Speaker 6:  I think that's the story here, right? It it's, there's always been like a

400
00:25:11,895 --> 00:25:15,335
Speaker 6:  pretty big gulf between the two and, And I think there's all als often been

401
00:25:15,885 --> 00:25:19,815
Speaker 6:  essential stuff in the pro line and now it's right,

402
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:23,775
Speaker 6:  it's the main camera is a little bit nicer on the pro, but that's

403
00:25:23,775 --> 00:25:27,535
Speaker 6:  fair. There's a telephoto camera on the pro That's cool. I like telephoto.

404
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:32,135
Speaker 6:  But the, I think that's it, right? Like it has a, it has a cool new redesign.

405
00:25:32,235 --> 00:25:36,175
Speaker 6:  You can't get this one in orange, right? No one is gonna know you have

406
00:25:36,175 --> 00:25:37,335
Speaker 6:  a brand new iPhone, which

407
00:25:37,915 --> 00:25:41,855
Speaker 1:  To be clear is not nothing like if we've learned one thing in

408
00:25:41,855 --> 00:25:45,575
Speaker 1:  the last seven days, it's that iPhone aesthetics matter an awful

409
00:25:45,635 --> 00:25:49,055
Speaker 1:  lot to people. And the, the addition of a new color

410
00:25:49,835 --> 00:25:53,735
Speaker 1:  was a big deal. Like especially a loud new color that screams this is a

411
00:25:53,735 --> 00:25:56,095
Speaker 1:  brand new iPhone that matters to people.

412
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:59,375
Speaker 6:  I do think there's something there, right? If you, if you look at this phone,

413
00:25:59,715 --> 00:26:03,695
Speaker 6:  it looks the exact same as every iPhone has for

414
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:07,595
Speaker 6:  the past like six years, right? And, and so if you're upgrading

415
00:26:07,595 --> 00:26:10,675
Speaker 6:  from an iPhone 11, you are not gonna be able to tell the difference. You're

416
00:26:10,675 --> 00:26:13,075
Speaker 6:  gonna be like, I replaced my phone with the same phone. Right. Which maybe

417
00:26:13,075 --> 00:26:16,595
Speaker 6:  feels like a bummer even if the change inside are enormous.

418
00:26:19,075 --> 00:26:20,455
Speaker 1:  Was that the sage one by the way?

419
00:26:20,715 --> 00:26:22,455
Speaker 6:  It is the sage one. The sage is, I love the sage.

420
00:26:22,485 --> 00:26:25,335
Speaker 1:  It's a great one for, for people watching this on YouTube. I hate doing this.

421
00:26:25,355 --> 00:26:28,095
Speaker 1:  Can you just hold it up? This is the one Alison said I'm, she's gonna take

422
00:26:28,095 --> 00:26:29,855
Speaker 1:  in with, at the event outta the stage And I haven't actually seen

423
00:26:30,035 --> 00:26:32,055
Speaker 6:  Second. Yeah, no, let me show you this. It's lovely.

424
00:26:32,715 --> 00:26:34,015
Speaker 1:  How do you feel about the sage? Beautiful.

425
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:37,895
Speaker 6:  The sage is a fantastic color. It's really nice. It looks, it looks really,

426
00:26:37,895 --> 00:26:40,175
Speaker 6:  really nice. It's one of the best iPhone colors in a long time.

427
00:26:40,315 --> 00:26:43,845
Speaker 1:  It is really nice. It's very, it's like a quiet color, but really nice looking,

428
00:26:43,975 --> 00:26:45,845
Speaker 1:  which I really appreciate. Like it

429
00:26:45,845 --> 00:26:49,485
Speaker 6:  Doesn't, it's saturated enough. Yeah. It's not like, yeah, it's not, it's

430
00:26:49,485 --> 00:26:50,325
Speaker 6:  not a whisper of

431
00:26:50,325 --> 00:26:53,005
Speaker 1:  Things. Yeah. Finally Apple did colors instead of just like, I always think

432
00:26:53,005 --> 00:26:56,445
Speaker 1:  of apple's color scheme as they just like put The iPhone down next to a can

433
00:26:56,445 --> 00:27:00,165
Speaker 1:  of paint and then ship it to you. This one they actually, they painted the

434
00:27:00,165 --> 00:27:01,165
Speaker 1:  things this time it's

435
00:27:01,165 --> 00:27:03,045
Speaker 6:  Very exciting. No, it looks really good, thank God.

436
00:27:04,385 --> 00:27:08,365
Speaker 1:  So having used, having used the 17 now, Jake, what's, what are

437
00:27:08,365 --> 00:27:10,045
Speaker 1:  the downsides? What do you not like about the 17?

438
00:27:10,515 --> 00:27:11,285
Speaker 6:  What I,

439
00:27:13,035 --> 00:27:16,235
Speaker 6:  I mean again, I'm just gonna keep complaining about notification management

440
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:19,795
Speaker 6:  on iOS, but like that's not No, nobody's here for that. Right? If if, if

441
00:27:19,795 --> 00:27:22,915
Speaker 6:  you want an iPhone, you like it's still an iPhone, it's great. Yeah, no,

442
00:27:22,995 --> 00:27:24,835
Speaker 6:  I truly, the the, the biggest

443
00:27:26,455 --> 00:27:30,075
Speaker 6:  issues that have, that I had with The iPhone 16 have been mitigated. Right?

444
00:27:30,075 --> 00:27:31,115
Speaker 6:  They were, they were the screen.

445
00:27:33,215 --> 00:27:36,775
Speaker 6:  I don't think I have major pro, like I don't think there are major flaws.

446
00:27:36,775 --> 00:27:40,455
Speaker 6:  I don't think there are major restrictions that, that

447
00:27:41,115 --> 00:27:45,015
Speaker 6:  are only right? Like, I don't know, are there some ProRes features?

448
00:27:45,055 --> 00:27:49,015
Speaker 6:  I can't get, I I couldn't even tell you. That's fine. Like I,

449
00:27:49,255 --> 00:27:51,855
Speaker 6:  I I don't need to shoot in ProRes. That's fine.

450
00:27:51,995 --> 00:27:54,295
Speaker 1:  Can I just say the, the fact that that question is really hard to answer

451
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:58,495
Speaker 1:  is so exciting and such a big deal for the base iPhone because it's like,

452
00:27:58,495 --> 00:28:00,975
Speaker 1:  yeah, Alison, you And I have been going through this for years where it's

453
00:28:00,975 --> 00:28:04,815
Speaker 1:  like, okay, I have, I have a, a list of things on each side And I

454
00:28:04,815 --> 00:28:07,695
Speaker 1:  have to try and explain to you whether

455
00:28:08,835 --> 00:28:12,415
Speaker 1:  the this tiny upgrade to the, the hardware and this new button and this tiny

456
00:28:12,635 --> 00:28:16,535
Speaker 1:  new thing in the camera. All of that adds up to you should, you know, spend

457
00:28:16,535 --> 00:28:20,375
Speaker 1:  a few hundred more dollars and get a new phone. I, we just don't have to

458
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:24,135
Speaker 1:  do that anymore. Right? Like the, and and that's the thing with so many of

459
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:26,615
Speaker 1:  these things, like v And I are gonna talk about the watches later, but I

460
00:28:26,615 --> 00:28:30,095
Speaker 1:  think what happened with the watches was they were basically like the, the

461
00:28:30,095 --> 00:28:33,895
Speaker 1:  base one is a great one and then for a little more money

462
00:28:34,395 --> 00:28:37,695
Speaker 1:  you get the health stuff and it's like that, that is a completely

463
00:28:37,695 --> 00:28:41,055
Speaker 1:  understandable decision, but there's nothing

464
00:28:41,245 --> 00:28:44,655
Speaker 1:  missing from the base model. And it feels like The iPhone for the first time

465
00:28:44,795 --> 00:28:48,375
Speaker 1:  in kind of, as long as I can remember, there's nothing missing on the base

466
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:48,775
Speaker 1:  iPhone.

467
00:28:49,245 --> 00:28:53,095
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It, it doesn't feel like you're putting up with something and

468
00:28:53,285 --> 00:28:57,215
Speaker 5:  Apple's being like, well if you want that, you really gotta pay a

469
00:28:57,215 --> 00:29:00,975
Speaker 5:  few extra a hundred dollars. Right. Jake, are you like a

470
00:29:01,925 --> 00:29:05,895
Speaker 5:  promotion guy, 120 hertz? Can you see, you see the difference

471
00:29:05,895 --> 00:29:07,055
Speaker 5:  and it bothers you kind of deal.

472
00:29:07,405 --> 00:29:10,815
Speaker 6:  Yeah, absolutely. And I think like once you get used to that, it's, it's

473
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:14,495
Speaker 6:  very hard to go back. It's like even after a week with the standard

474
00:29:14,495 --> 00:29:18,215
Speaker 6:  model coming from a one 20 herz display, everything felt so

475
00:29:18,245 --> 00:29:19,655
Speaker 6:  like sluggish. My

476
00:29:19,655 --> 00:29:22,495
Speaker 1:  IPhone 16 is sitting here and it's, it's hearing you and it's really upset

477
00:29:22,495 --> 00:29:24,895
Speaker 1:  by all of this. It's, I just want you to know you've been hurting the feelings

478
00:29:24,895 --> 00:29:27,375
Speaker 1:  of my still very new iPhone. I

479
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:31,335
Speaker 6:  I don't know how you're living with that thing. It's, I, I seriously, like

480
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:35,535
Speaker 6:  it's hurting my productivity, not having a screen that's on, like

481
00:29:35,675 --> 00:29:36,975
Speaker 6:  it really is. I

482
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:39,935
Speaker 1:  Will say Allison, you And I talked about the always on display last week

483
00:29:40,355 --> 00:29:43,685
Speaker 1:  and a couple of people reached out and were like, hey, one thing you should

484
00:29:43,745 --> 00:29:47,205
Speaker 1:  try is turning off the wallpaper on the always on display.

485
00:29:47,765 --> 00:29:51,685
Speaker 1:  And I went to turn off the wallpaper on my iPhone 16 and was

486
00:29:51,685 --> 00:29:54,365
Speaker 1:  like, oh right. I don't even have an always on display. Like it's,

487
00:29:54,365 --> 00:29:54,965
Speaker 5:  Oh no, it's

488
00:29:54,965 --> 00:29:58,205
Speaker 1:  Been, I hated it so much. I bought a phone that doesn't support it without

489
00:29:58,205 --> 00:29:59,005
Speaker 1:  even realizing.

490
00:30:00,075 --> 00:30:03,965
Speaker 5:  Okay JI wanna, Jake, where do you stand on the wallpaper? Dimming on

491
00:30:03,965 --> 00:30:04,845
Speaker 5:  the always on display.

492
00:30:05,685 --> 00:30:09,045
Speaker 6:  I thought I was gonna hate it because I, I have not been using

493
00:30:09,565 --> 00:30:13,125
Speaker 6:  that feature in the past and actually it's totally fine. Doesn't bother me

494
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:13,925
Speaker 6:  at all. Yes, yes.

495
00:30:14,075 --> 00:30:17,005
Speaker 5:  Okay. One more. Yes, it's fine. Vote for totally fine. This

496
00:30:17,005 --> 00:30:20,645
Speaker 1:  Is the worst you get are you guys are terrible. So on the pro

497
00:30:20,645 --> 00:30:23,805
Speaker 1:  Allison, you, you've, you're not reviewing it, Todd Hazelton is reviewing

498
00:30:23,805 --> 00:30:26,645
Speaker 1:  it and we'll we'll link to that in the show notes, but you've used it a bunch

499
00:30:26,815 --> 00:30:30,765
Speaker 1:  along with it. How does it feel compared to kind

500
00:30:30,765 --> 00:30:33,245
Speaker 1:  of these other funds? Like it is bigger and heavier. It is the more like

501
00:30:33,715 --> 00:30:37,525
Speaker 1:  substantial device and actually it seems like more so this year because the

502
00:30:37,525 --> 00:30:40,565
Speaker 1:  air is allowed to be the thin one. This one doesn't have to be like, how,

503
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:43,245
Speaker 1:  how does the pro feel just as a phone to use right now?

504
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:47,845
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it, it feels a little like a cheat kind of going

505
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:51,765
Speaker 5:  between the air and the pro is, is like not the situation most people

506
00:30:51,765 --> 00:30:55,405
Speaker 5:  are gonna be in. So the, the pro really

507
00:30:55,745 --> 00:30:59,605
Speaker 5:  did feel kind of just like dense and heavy

508
00:30:59,865 --> 00:31:03,845
Speaker 5:  in a way. I, I don't think it would've really struck me

509
00:31:03,865 --> 00:31:07,325
Speaker 5:  if I hadn't been using the air so much. The,

510
00:31:08,425 --> 00:31:12,365
Speaker 5:  the switch to the more curved edges. I don't

511
00:31:12,645 --> 00:31:15,645
Speaker 5:  particularly like, so the last,

512
00:31:16,465 --> 00:31:20,325
Speaker 5:  the 16 pro had more straight sides.

513
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,925
Speaker 5:  I feel like that is nicer in my hand. I can grab another phone. I

514
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:28,245
Speaker 5:  don't feel like it's gonna go flying. Most people could put a case on their

515
00:31:28,245 --> 00:31:31,685
Speaker 5:  phone. This does not bother them. Yeah, it bothers me a tiny bit,

516
00:31:32,985 --> 00:31:36,685
Speaker 5:  but I'm, I'm still just appreciative of the

517
00:31:36,685 --> 00:31:40,605
Speaker 5:  smaller pro being everything that the

518
00:31:40,605 --> 00:31:43,725
Speaker 5:  bigger pro is. Like the prom max, you get the same

519
00:31:44,355 --> 00:31:48,285
Speaker 5:  telephoto camera, you know, it's just a matter of battery life

520
00:31:48,385 --> 00:31:51,405
Speaker 5:  really in screen size if that's a thing to you.

521
00:31:52,555 --> 00:31:55,525
Speaker 5:  Yeah. The the little pro kind of remains my,

522
00:31:56,465 --> 00:31:59,925
Speaker 5:  my little pet favorite of, of the bunch.

523
00:32:00,425 --> 00:32:04,245
Speaker 1:  It is a very good phone. I think there, there are increasingly few people

524
00:32:04,285 --> 00:32:06,445
Speaker 1:  I would recommend it to because it's like, if you want all the things that

525
00:32:06,445 --> 00:32:10,085
Speaker 1:  the pro has, you probably also want more battery and more screen

526
00:32:10,225 --> 00:32:13,805
Speaker 1:  on which to do those things. So I'm like, I'm not sure who the base

527
00:32:14,105 --> 00:32:14,965
Speaker 1:  pro is for,

528
00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:19,205
Speaker 1:  but I also am with you. And that like, there's something about that phone

529
00:32:19,205 --> 00:32:22,245
Speaker 1:  that I just really love. It's like you are, you are the in-between phone

530
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:23,525
Speaker 1:  And I love you for that.

531
00:32:24,035 --> 00:32:27,605
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I'm like, just please don't go anywhere. Don't get bigger.

532
00:32:27,735 --> 00:32:28,525
Speaker 5:  Don't disappear

533
00:32:28,915 --> 00:32:32,125
Speaker 1:  Next year. Apple, take that one and make it thin. No, and everything will

534
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:32,405
Speaker 1:  be fine.

535
00:32:32,795 --> 00:32:34,525
Speaker 5:  Whoa. Mind blown.

536
00:32:34,525 --> 00:32:38,485
Speaker 1:  Yeah. The iPhone Pro air And I will, I will love that phone

537
00:32:38,485 --> 00:32:41,205
Speaker 1:  And I will come, come on the show And I will spend a month talking about

538
00:32:41,205 --> 00:32:44,965
Speaker 1:  how stupid the name is. And that is, that is my promise to you. Allison,

539
00:32:45,605 --> 00:32:48,005
Speaker 1:  question on the, the camera thing. 'cause Right, I think if, if we're looking

540
00:32:48,005 --> 00:32:51,845
Speaker 1:  at it and we're saying the, the single most compelling and,

541
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:55,605
Speaker 1:  and in many ways only reason to go from base iPhone to

542
00:32:55,605 --> 00:32:59,325
Speaker 1:  iPhone Pro is still about the cameras. You're,

543
00:32:59,325 --> 00:33:02,245
Speaker 1:  you're the most professional photographer of the three of us.

544
00:33:03,105 --> 00:33:05,645
Speaker 1:  How compelling is that case to you right now? This year

545
00:33:06,995 --> 00:33:10,965
Speaker 5:  It's, you know, it does put you

546
00:33:11,025 --> 00:33:14,965
Speaker 5:  in a, in a class of like you really care about image quality,

547
00:33:15,095 --> 00:33:19,085
Speaker 5:  which is all, all three of us I think. So

548
00:33:19,185 --> 00:33:23,125
Speaker 5:  on the base iPhone, the camera sensor in

549
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:26,805
Speaker 5:  the main camera is just a little smaller than

550
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:30,445
Speaker 5:  the one you get on the pros. You do not notice

551
00:33:31,005 --> 00:33:34,605
Speaker 5:  anything about this in good lighting. Portrait mode's fine.

552
00:33:35,895 --> 00:33:39,805
Speaker 5:  Where I see a difference and I'm, the air also has the

553
00:33:39,805 --> 00:33:43,445
Speaker 5:  smaller sensor on the main, as the base

554
00:33:43,745 --> 00:33:47,085
Speaker 5:  iPhone is in the two x portraits.

555
00:33:48,245 --> 00:33:52,105
Speaker 5:  So if, if I've lost anybody, then that's fine just

556
00:33:52,105 --> 00:33:56,065
Speaker 5:  by the base iPhone, if you know what I mean by the two

557
00:33:56,065 --> 00:33:59,985
Speaker 5:  time portraits and you're screaming like, oh God, I can't give that up. Like

558
00:34:00,545 --> 00:34:03,825
Speaker 5:  I, I take portrait mode photos constantly

559
00:34:04,255 --> 00:34:08,225
Speaker 5:  take them of my kid the two time Zoom is just so nice for

560
00:34:08,225 --> 00:34:11,785
Speaker 5:  that. So one X feels too wide. The four

561
00:34:12,105 --> 00:34:15,585
Speaker 5:  x on the pros this year is actually very nice, but sometimes that's too

562
00:34:15,755 --> 00:34:19,625
Speaker 5:  close anyway. But I can see the difference in low light,

563
00:34:19,885 --> 00:34:23,305
Speaker 5:  you know, you're taking a small, a portion of a smaller sensor

564
00:34:23,765 --> 00:34:27,465
Speaker 5:  and you lose detail that the pro hangs onto. So it's,

565
00:34:27,535 --> 00:34:31,425
Speaker 5:  it's in the minutia. I don't think there's a, a

566
00:34:31,555 --> 00:34:35,465
Speaker 5:  great case for, oh you really should spend extra on

567
00:34:35,465 --> 00:34:39,345
Speaker 5:  the pro because two times portraits, but it's, it's there if you go

568
00:34:39,345 --> 00:34:39,865
Speaker 5:  looking for it.

569
00:34:39,895 --> 00:34:43,545
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I think I I I find this all really

570
00:34:43,905 --> 00:34:46,865
Speaker 1:  interesting like from an Apple strategy perspective, but from a, just like

571
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:50,705
Speaker 1:  I'm a person who wants a phone perspective, really exciting because in many

572
00:34:50,705 --> 00:34:54,505
Speaker 1:  ways I think this decision of which iPhone to buy is kind of

573
00:34:54,505 --> 00:34:57,345
Speaker 1:  easier than it's been in a long time. Where it's like, do you just want a

574
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,585
Speaker 1:  really good iPhone by the, by The iPhone 17 if you want the camera

575
00:35:01,325 --> 00:35:04,945
Speaker 1:  by the pro, if you want the like aesthetics

576
00:35:05,245 --> 00:35:08,105
Speaker 1:  by the air, like done and done right. And I think there're small trade offs

577
00:35:08,305 --> 00:35:11,905
Speaker 1:  on each side, But that fact it, it is as clean

578
00:35:12,585 --> 00:35:16,505
Speaker 1:  a delineation between the phones as I can remember, like in a long

579
00:35:16,505 --> 00:35:16,665
Speaker 1:  time.

580
00:35:17,255 --> 00:35:21,185
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's very helpful to us. Like a huge Yeah. People who

581
00:35:21,505 --> 00:35:21,905
Speaker 5:  recommend phones.

582
00:35:22,285 --> 00:35:25,905
Speaker 1:  Travis, our producer just slacked me. The air is an orange though, and it

583
00:35:25,905 --> 00:35:27,785
Speaker 1:  makes a reasonable point. Brad,

584
00:35:27,785 --> 00:35:31,585
Speaker 6:  Do you think like it's, it's been so frustrating. I think I for the, the

585
00:35:31,695 --> 00:35:35,585
Speaker 6:  typical buyer, right? The thing that says iPhone, right?

586
00:35:35,605 --> 00:35:39,565
Speaker 6:  The plain old iPhone. It should, it should be the essential version of the

587
00:35:39,565 --> 00:35:43,005
Speaker 6:  phone. And I, I truly feel like that has not been the case in recent years

588
00:35:43,345 --> 00:35:46,925
Speaker 6:  and this year I it it is so clearly the case, right? Like

589
00:35:47,365 --> 00:35:50,125
Speaker 6:  I I don't think you're missing anything major. I think you'll have a fantastic

590
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:54,085
Speaker 6:  phone for a while to go and, you know, I don't know what's coming next for

591
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:57,285
Speaker 6:  the pro, but it, it doesn't feel like there's any obvious thing at the moment

592
00:35:57,955 --> 00:36:01,685
Speaker 6:  that I don't know. You have to be like, well that's too bad. Yeah. Right.

593
00:36:01,685 --> 00:36:03,205
Speaker 6:  You don't get a vapor chamber cooling.

594
00:36:03,945 --> 00:36:05,605
Speaker 1:  Oh no. Whatever will I do?

595
00:36:07,435 --> 00:36:10,325
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I don't have a vapor chamber. I can't vape with it. Like what are we

596
00:36:10,325 --> 00:36:11,925
Speaker 1:  even doing here If

597
00:36:11,925 --> 00:36:13,205
Speaker 6:  They build a vape into the pro?

598
00:36:14,185 --> 00:36:15,565
Speaker 1:  Oh no, that's i's changed.

599
00:36:15,565 --> 00:36:17,845
Speaker 6:  That's terrible for America. But they'll sell a lot of phones.

600
00:36:18,065 --> 00:36:21,885
Speaker 1:  Indeed. Alright, so before I let you guys go, we got a hotline question that

601
00:36:21,885 --> 00:36:25,735
Speaker 1:  the three of us are gonna answer together and it is, it

602
00:36:25,735 --> 00:36:28,615
Speaker 1:  caused me to think more than I thought it would. So here lemme just play

603
00:36:28,615 --> 00:36:30,055
Speaker 1:  it and then let, we're gonna talk about it.

604
00:36:30,435 --> 00:36:34,335
Speaker 7:  You know what, I feel like anybody who has an iPhone air is now

605
00:36:34,405 --> 00:36:38,335
Speaker 7:  susceptible to losing their phone in the couch. It's gonna

606
00:36:38,335 --> 00:36:39,935
Speaker 7:  be the most losable phone ever.

607
00:36:41,045 --> 00:36:44,575
Speaker 1:  Okay, so here two questions. A Allison, true or false

608
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:46,615
Speaker 1:  is this, is this a very losable phone?

609
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:49,455
Speaker 5:  Oh, true. Yeah. I was on a, a plane

610
00:36:50,955 --> 00:36:54,895
Speaker 5:  and had The iPhone air. I usually put it in my pocket and

611
00:36:54,955 --> 00:36:58,815
Speaker 5:  it has happened that the phone will kind of fall out when I'm moving around.

612
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:01,575
Speaker 5:  And then, then you're in that situation where you're like, oh God, it's in

613
00:37:01,575 --> 00:37:04,895
Speaker 5:  the seat somewhere. They say don't adjust your seat 'cause you're gonna start

614
00:37:04,935 --> 00:37:08,655
Speaker 5:  a fire with the battery or something like that. I had almost a full panic

615
00:37:08,655 --> 00:37:12,575
Speaker 5:  attack because I thought it had fallen out of my pocket and it,

616
00:37:13,035 --> 00:37:16,655
Speaker 5:  it will just slip right in between the seats and then you gotta call it

617
00:37:16,715 --> 00:37:20,615
Speaker 5:  flight attendant. Long story short, I just, I put it in my bag

618
00:37:20,615 --> 00:37:24,415
Speaker 5:  And I forgot it was in my bag. But that's a long way of saying yes.

619
00:37:24,685 --> 00:37:27,335
Speaker 5:  This feels like a phone that you will lose in the couch.

620
00:37:27,515 --> 00:37:31,415
Speaker 1:  It is a, it is ausable phone even maybe not in the

621
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:35,295
Speaker 1:  ways that you think it's gonna be Ausable phone. Yes. Okay. And then

622
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:39,275
Speaker 1:  my other question is, does everyone else almost lose their phone

623
00:37:39,295 --> 00:37:42,675
Speaker 1:  all the time? Because I almost lose my phone all the time.

624
00:37:43,145 --> 00:37:46,715
Speaker 1:  Like, like yesterday I was sitting down in the car

625
00:37:48,045 --> 00:37:51,555
Speaker 1:  phone just slipped outta my pocket without even noticing and fell

626
00:37:51,825 --> 00:37:55,795
Speaker 1:  like in the side between the seat and the car door. Yes. And I

627
00:37:55,795 --> 00:37:59,585
Speaker 1:  spent like half the afternoon being like, oh no, I've lost my phone. It's

628
00:37:59,585 --> 00:38:02,745
Speaker 1:  gone forever. I have also lost my phone in couch cushions. I have also just

629
00:38:03,025 --> 00:38:05,585
Speaker 1:  randomly left my phone places that it doesn't make sense to leave your phone.

630
00:38:05,735 --> 00:38:09,465
Speaker 1:  Like is this like a specific medical condition that I have or

631
00:38:09,465 --> 00:38:11,385
Speaker 1:  does everyone almost lose their phone all the time?

632
00:38:11,825 --> 00:38:15,745
Speaker 5:  I, if I'm gonna lose it, it is in that exact situation in the

633
00:38:15,765 --> 00:38:19,665
Speaker 5:  car. 'cause it will just go in between all the

634
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:23,585
Speaker 5:  weird inner workings of the seat and the console. And I will

635
00:38:23,585 --> 00:38:26,945
Speaker 5:  spend a lot of time like fishing it out from the bottom of the car where

636
00:38:26,945 --> 00:38:28,625
Speaker 5:  there's a lot of goldfish crumbs. Yep.

637
00:38:30,445 --> 00:38:33,745
Speaker 5:  But I've trained myself, I think

638
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:38,235
Speaker 5:  to leave my phone in very specific places. So

639
00:38:38,295 --> 00:38:41,595
Speaker 5:  if I go in the kitchen, there's like a place I put it down in the kitchen.

640
00:38:41,695 --> 00:38:45,355
Speaker 5:  If I go in the TV room, I, and, and when I,

641
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,875
Speaker 5:  when I have that moment of, oh, I lost my phone. I don't remember where it

642
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:52,115
Speaker 5:  is, I go to one of those spots and it's usually there.

643
00:38:52,695 --> 00:38:56,635
Speaker 5:  But I have had to like actively do that otherwise

644
00:38:56,715 --> 00:38:57,795
Speaker 5:  I would lose my phone all the time.

645
00:38:58,345 --> 00:39:01,075
Speaker 1:  Okay. I'm glad that's not just me, Jake is sitting here like, I've never

646
00:39:01,075 --> 00:39:02,235
Speaker 1:  lost a phone in history.

647
00:39:02,755 --> 00:39:05,835
Speaker 6:  I, I used to be like really, really good at this because I, I just always

648
00:39:05,835 --> 00:39:08,115
Speaker 6:  just like put it straight back in my pocket when I was done with it. And

649
00:39:08,115 --> 00:39:11,915
Speaker 6:  now phones got bigger and these like silicone cases are

650
00:39:11,995 --> 00:39:15,955
Speaker 6:  really popular and as they get older they get kind of like funky. They like

651
00:39:15,955 --> 00:39:19,675
Speaker 6:  don't slip into pockets very well. And so now I'm just, I'm just like, stick

652
00:39:19,675 --> 00:39:23,215
Speaker 6:  it wherever. It's like, I don't know, it could be anywhere.

653
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:25,775
Speaker 6:  It's fine if it gets lost. It, it was meant to be

654
00:39:25,945 --> 00:39:29,175
Speaker 1:  Hands down. The best feature of the Apple watch is the thing where it will

655
00:39:29,175 --> 00:39:32,615
Speaker 1:  make my phone make noise That's good. So that I can find it, which I do

656
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:37,215
Speaker 1:  more often than I'm proud of. Alright, we need to take a break. Alison

657
00:39:37,315 --> 00:39:40,455
Speaker 1:  and Jake, thank you both for doing this. Good luck

658
00:39:41,025 --> 00:39:45,015
Speaker 1:  being just in the cross hairs of our commenters for

659
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:48,295
Speaker 1:  the foreseeable future. We gotta take a break, we'll be right back.

660
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:24,205
Speaker 1:  You really have like spent, how many hours have you spent at your

661
00:43:24,205 --> 00:43:25,605
Speaker 1:  home in the last 10 days?

662
00:43:27,545 --> 00:43:30,835
Speaker 9:  Not many. Yeah, maybe 36.

663
00:43:31,265 --> 00:43:34,395
Speaker 9:  Yeah, that's, that's how, that's probably how many in the last 10 days.

664
00:43:34,635 --> 00:43:38,435
Speaker 1:  That's good stuff. So you're, if if I have my schedule correct here,

665
00:43:38,435 --> 00:43:40,195
Speaker 1:  you're currently traveling for MediConnect?

666
00:43:40,895 --> 00:43:44,755
Speaker 9:  Yes, I am. Okay. What's happening at Meta Connect? You can read

667
00:43:44,935 --> 00:43:47,635
Speaker 9:  the leaks at The Verge dot com but

668
00:43:47,635 --> 00:43:51,315
Speaker 1:  I Yeah. Gosh, what could it be? Could it be Mark Zuckerberg has many glasses?

669
00:43:53,185 --> 00:43:54,795
Speaker 9:  What could it possibly be?

670
00:43:56,345 --> 00:43:59,355
Speaker 1:  Exactly. Alright, well we'll come back to that another time. I actually think

671
00:43:59,465 --> 00:44:03,275
Speaker 1:  there's a chance Meta Connect is like sneaky fascinating this year, but

672
00:44:03,275 --> 00:44:07,195
Speaker 1:  we'll come back to that another time. You are also deep in

673
00:44:07,215 --> 00:44:10,555
Speaker 1:  the throes of oh, so many Apple reviews. So many,

674
00:44:11,055 --> 00:44:14,795
Speaker 1:  And I, I wanna, I wanna talk about AirPods for like two seconds because

675
00:44:15,035 --> 00:44:18,315
Speaker 1:  I think that is all that is required to more or less tell the story of AirPods

676
00:44:18,735 --> 00:44:21,515
Speaker 1:  and Oh, you're wearing them. Okay. I am wearing them. So let's, let's start

677
00:44:21,515 --> 00:44:25,355
Speaker 1:  with the wearing them because I would say that your feeling

678
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:28,915
Speaker 1:  and the general consensus on the AirPods PO three is that they are terrific.

679
00:44:29,025 --> 00:44:31,570
Speaker 1:  They were, they're, we came outta the event being like, like this is the

680
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:34,525
Speaker 1:  most straightforwardly great upgrade. And it seems to have been pretty much

681
00:44:34,525 --> 00:44:35,085
Speaker 1:  exactly that.

682
00:44:35,515 --> 00:44:39,365
Speaker 9:  Basically Apple went and tripled down on a good thing and made

683
00:44:39,365 --> 00:44:42,965
Speaker 9:  everything that you like about the AirPods better and then said, Hmm, what

684
00:44:42,965 --> 00:44:46,565
Speaker 9:  do you not like about the AirPods? Let's see if we can fix that too. And

685
00:44:46,565 --> 00:44:50,365
Speaker 9:  you know, the by and large, the largest, the most

686
00:44:50,365 --> 00:44:53,685
Speaker 9:  common complaint that I've ever heard about AirPods from people who are tech

687
00:44:53,685 --> 00:44:57,165
Speaker 9:  journalists, from people who are normal people from just anyone

688
00:44:57,505 --> 00:45:01,085
Speaker 9:  is the fit, right? Because either you are blessed with ears that the

689
00:45:01,155 --> 00:45:04,885
Speaker 9:  AirPods fit into, and that's true across the regular AirPods range or the

690
00:45:04,885 --> 00:45:08,685
Speaker 9:  pro range, or you're, you're just not, you're just not blessed with the,

691
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:12,445
Speaker 9:  the, the ear canal for, for an AirPod and you know, you take the AirPods

692
00:45:12,445 --> 00:45:15,685
Speaker 9:  Pro three out of the case at a first glance, eh, it just looks the same,

693
00:45:15,685 --> 00:45:19,645
Speaker 9:  right? But then I happen to have my own personal pair of the AirPods Pro

694
00:45:19,645 --> 00:45:23,245
Speaker 9:  two. You take that outta the case and you go like, oh, oh, oh oh.

695
00:45:23,825 --> 00:45:27,525
Speaker 9:  The shape is definitely different. The AirPods Pro two are

696
00:45:27,525 --> 00:45:30,765
Speaker 9:  flatter, these are more angled. So when you look at them side to side and

697
00:45:30,765 --> 00:45:33,805
Speaker 9:  you, you compare them from every single angle and we have some comparison

698
00:45:33,805 --> 00:45:37,645
Speaker 9:  photos in my review, you can just tell that they're much more angled and

699
00:45:37,885 --> 00:45:41,725
Speaker 9:  designed to fit in better. One thing that you can do is you can kind of

700
00:45:41,725 --> 00:45:45,445
Speaker 9:  twist to adjust the fit a little bit with these, and you could,

701
00:45:45,505 --> 00:45:49,405
Speaker 9:  you could do that with the AirPods Pro two. But you know, if you twist

702
00:45:49,405 --> 00:45:52,645
Speaker 9:  it just a little too far, it's gonna pop out this, you can actually feel

703
00:45:52,645 --> 00:45:56,565
Speaker 9:  it, at least with my ear shape, you can feel it, get

704
00:45:56,595 --> 00:46:00,325
Speaker 9:  more secure, the seal tightening and not in an uncomfortable way. So that's

705
00:46:00,325 --> 00:46:00,405
Speaker 9:  a

706
00:46:00,405 --> 00:46:03,845
Speaker 1:  Pretty normal thing for these kind of in ear things that you, you kind of,

707
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:06,805
Speaker 1:  they, they teach you to sort of put it in and turn it. Yeah. And that's actually

708
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:10,405
Speaker 1:  how you get that seal. But AirPods, my, my experience has never been, are,

709
00:46:10,465 --> 00:46:13,325
Speaker 1:  are particularly suited to that. So it's good that they've leaned

710
00:46:13,325 --> 00:46:16,925
Speaker 9:  Into that. No. So they've leaned into that. I went on a run with these and

711
00:46:16,925 --> 00:46:20,805
Speaker 9:  during that run I went, eh, eh, trying to shake 'em outta my ear and

712
00:46:20,805 --> 00:46:23,525
Speaker 9:  they didn't shake out. So, you know, that's a process actually. So, you know,

713
00:46:23,565 --> 00:46:26,445
Speaker 9:  I really do think that if you've had trouble with fit before that you should

714
00:46:26,445 --> 00:46:30,365
Speaker 9:  go to an Apple store or bug your friend who has them to see and

715
00:46:30,365 --> 00:46:34,005
Speaker 9:  and try them out before you commit to buying them. Because every

716
00:46:34,145 --> 00:46:38,045
Speaker 9:  ear shape is unique and I've, I've never had a major problem with

717
00:46:38,275 --> 00:46:42,045
Speaker 9:  AirPods fit, so I'm not surprised that I also

718
00:46:42,045 --> 00:46:45,485
Speaker 9:  don't have a problem here. But if you've had a problem in the past,

719
00:46:46,645 --> 00:46:50,565
Speaker 9:  I would recommend trying trying them out before getting

720
00:46:50,595 --> 00:46:53,325
Speaker 9:  your hopes up too high. I'm just saying as someone who

721
00:46:54,265 --> 00:46:57,885
Speaker 9:  hasn't had that issue, they still fit me better. So like there,

722
00:46:57,995 --> 00:47:01,805
Speaker 9:  it's like I even, I saw an improvement. So I think a lot of people

723
00:47:01,835 --> 00:47:03,565
Speaker 9:  will see an improvement. That's

724
00:47:03,565 --> 00:47:07,365
Speaker 1:  Good news. So it seems like, yeah, the, the, the existence of more

725
00:47:07,455 --> 00:47:10,965
Speaker 1:  sizes of tips plus the little subtle design changes both feel like wins.

726
00:47:11,185 --> 00:47:13,725
Speaker 1:  The thing that seems to be somewhat controversial is the actual material

727
00:47:14,025 --> 00:47:17,965
Speaker 1:  of the things themselves. They're not, they're not foam, but

728
00:47:17,965 --> 00:47:21,245
Speaker 1:  they're not, not foam. Like what, what are these things you're sticking in

729
00:47:21,245 --> 00:47:21,525
Speaker 1:  your ears?

730
00:47:22,065 --> 00:47:25,965
Speaker 9:  So I saw Dan Seifert right after the Apple event, and Dan is

731
00:47:26,145 --> 00:47:29,925
Speaker 9:  is famously, if you know him, he has had problems with earbuds and so

732
00:47:29,985 --> 00:47:33,845
Speaker 9:  he uses the real traditional foam tip and he's like, show me these

733
00:47:33,845 --> 00:47:36,805
Speaker 9:  things and show me that foam tip. And I showed him the tip and he goes, that's

734
00:47:36,805 --> 00:47:38,405
Speaker 9:  not a foam tip. And he's correct

735
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:42,965
Speaker 9:  and he's kind of correct. It's, it's not what you would think a traditional

736
00:47:42,965 --> 00:47:46,845
Speaker 9:  foam tip is, you know, a foam tip. It's foam, it expands in your ear

737
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:50,485
Speaker 9:  and it gets disgusting if you sweat in them. So these

738
00:47:51,305 --> 00:47:54,485
Speaker 9:  to the naked eye are gonna look exactly the same as the silicone tips that

739
00:47:54,485 --> 00:47:57,965
Speaker 9:  you're used to from the regular AirPods Pro. The difference is, is in the

740
00:47:57,965 --> 00:48:01,085
Speaker 9:  very like, and hopefully this doesn't mess up anything in the very

741
00:48:01,975 --> 00:48:05,925
Speaker 9:  front part right here. That's where they've infused some foam.

742
00:48:06,765 --> 00:48:06,885
Speaker 1:  I

743
00:48:06,885 --> 00:48:10,165
Speaker 9:  See. And the reason why they, they've done that is that's the part that will

744
00:48:10,185 --> 00:48:13,885
Speaker 9:  expand for the more secure fit. The rest of it is silicone so that when you

745
00:48:13,885 --> 00:48:17,645
Speaker 9:  sweat, it doesn't get disgusting. Right. And so that

746
00:48:17,755 --> 00:48:21,085
Speaker 9:  it's easier to clean. That's the the philosophy that I was told when

747
00:48:21,885 --> 00:48:25,845
Speaker 9:  I was at Apple Park on the day of the event. And so, you know,

748
00:48:27,325 --> 00:48:31,145
Speaker 9:  foam's there, just don't, don't think of it as like a traditional foam

749
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:31,545
Speaker 9:  tip.

750
00:48:32,085 --> 00:48:35,345
Speaker 1:  Do you notice them, do they feel any different in your ears because of the

751
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:36,065
Speaker 1:  material change?

752
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:39,825
Speaker 9:  Absolutely not. Okay. Like they just feel like I, the, the fit feels more

753
00:48:39,825 --> 00:48:43,545
Speaker 9:  secure. It could be that some of that is this foam infused tip,

754
00:48:43,805 --> 00:48:47,235
Speaker 9:  but just looking at them I was like, this, this looks the same.

755
00:48:47,795 --> 00:48:51,315
Speaker 9:  Like they, they won't fit. Like you can't interchange the tips between the

756
00:48:51,315 --> 00:48:54,635
Speaker 9:  old ones and the new ones. Mm. So there is a difference there. It's just

757
00:48:54,635 --> 00:48:58,535
Speaker 9:  like, I, I put them in my ears and, and they stay that

758
00:48:58,895 --> 00:49:01,255
Speaker 1:  Interesting. I think the, the thing that I'm most curious about with these

759
00:49:01,395 --> 00:49:04,015
Speaker 1:  is like, you, like, you know, you mentioned everybody's ears are different.

760
00:49:04,235 --> 00:49:07,815
Speaker 1:  My thing is my ears start to get like

761
00:49:08,165 --> 00:49:12,135
Speaker 1:  sore after wearing the sort of in-ear headphones for too long.

762
00:49:12,615 --> 00:49:16,575
Speaker 1:  It's one of the reasons I've become a huge fan of the, the shocks over the,

763
00:49:16,575 --> 00:49:17,415
Speaker 1:  the conduction

764
00:49:17,415 --> 00:49:18,615
Speaker 9:  Stuff. Oh, I, you know, I love those too. Yeah,

765
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:22,375
Speaker 1:  I do. And there's just something about them that is like, because they're

766
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:26,015
Speaker 1:  not blocking that ear canal, there's just, there's some, it's some combination

767
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:29,455
Speaker 1:  of like the buildup of pressure that I feel in my head from having them blocked

768
00:49:30,305 --> 00:49:34,295
Speaker 1:  along with just the physical toll of them pressing against my ear

769
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:38,255
Speaker 1:  canal. If I wear them like for hours and hours, like on a cross country

770
00:49:38,255 --> 00:49:41,295
Speaker 1:  flight or something, I will come off and like feel physical pain as I take

771
00:49:41,295 --> 00:49:44,935
Speaker 1:  them out. And I've seen mixed things on that front.

772
00:49:45,275 --> 00:49:48,455
Speaker 1:  In this one. Some people are like, they block sound better,

773
00:49:49,315 --> 00:49:52,895
Speaker 1:  but as a result they're actually, the seal is better, which means they're

774
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,655
Speaker 1:  going to hurt more.

775
00:49:55,195 --> 00:49:57,775
Speaker 1:  But, so I think apple just like continues to poke at this. And this is another

776
00:49:57,775 --> 00:50:00,935
Speaker 1:  reason I'm excited about the idea of there being five tip sizes is like,

777
00:50:00,935 --> 00:50:04,135
Speaker 1:  what I normally do is just go to the smallest tip size And I will sacrifice

778
00:50:04,295 --> 00:50:08,095
Speaker 1:  a little bit of the noise cancellation in order to not

779
00:50:08,095 --> 00:50:11,135
Speaker 1:  have them hurt over time. So the idea that I can go even smaller here

780
00:50:12,055 --> 00:50:14,175
Speaker 1:  actually seems potentially like it'll solve that problem for me.

781
00:50:14,525 --> 00:50:18,335
Speaker 9:  Yeah. So here's what I can say from my testing. I wore them on two

782
00:50:18,335 --> 00:50:22,215
Speaker 9:  cross country flights now for several hours at a time and they

783
00:50:22,215 --> 00:50:25,895
Speaker 9:  were pretty comfortable for me. I did wear, I've worn these

784
00:50:26,075 --> 00:50:30,005
Speaker 9:  an obscene amount over the last few days to test them. So

785
00:50:30,005 --> 00:50:33,725
Speaker 9:  when I was wearing them for a really, really long time, like I wanna say

786
00:50:35,195 --> 00:50:38,945
Speaker 9:  seven hours at a time, at one, at one point while I was writing my

787
00:50:38,945 --> 00:50:41,865
Speaker 9:  review 'cause I was like, oh let me, lemme check this. Let me verify like

788
00:50:41,965 --> 00:50:45,905
Speaker 9:  my notes and whatnot. I did have a little bit

789
00:50:45,905 --> 00:50:49,865
Speaker 9:  of like itchiness on the inside, but that's just kind of similar to

790
00:50:49,885 --> 00:50:53,145
Speaker 9:  any AirPods. But by and large I found them quite comfortable.

791
00:50:53,825 --> 00:50:57,505
Speaker 9:  I didn't experience as much pressure buildup, although there were times

792
00:50:57,535 --> 00:51:01,345
Speaker 9:  that I did and usually I would just take them out, have a little break, put

793
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:05,345
Speaker 9:  'em back in. So I think if that's something you're sensitive to, you're gonna

794
00:51:05,345 --> 00:51:08,145
Speaker 9:  have to play around with it. I don't think it's gonna go away completely,

795
00:51:08,285 --> 00:51:09,385
Speaker 9:  but it is improved.

796
00:51:09,895 --> 00:51:13,505
Speaker 1:  Okay. I'm excited to try 'em. These, these were the one thing I like jumped

797
00:51:13,605 --> 00:51:17,025
Speaker 1:  to buy immediately because I'm like, it's, it's been a while. I still have

798
00:51:17,025 --> 00:51:20,145
Speaker 1:  the regular AirPods with the lightning port and it's like this, this feels

799
00:51:20,145 --> 00:51:23,545
Speaker 1:  like the thing to upgrade for. So I'm excited about that. Mostly I wanna

800
00:51:23,545 --> 00:51:26,745
Speaker 1:  talk about the watch 'cause I think the, the watch situation

801
00:51:27,555 --> 00:51:30,865
Speaker 1:  seems much more complicated. And I would say what you found so far is that

802
00:51:30,865 --> 00:51:34,185
Speaker 1:  our, our suspicions from last week have been confirmed, which is that the

803
00:51:34,185 --> 00:51:37,785
Speaker 1:  watch SE three is the watch most people should buy.

804
00:51:38,015 --> 00:51:39,265
Speaker 1:  Tell me why you landed there.

805
00:51:39,855 --> 00:51:43,785
Speaker 9:  It's the star. It has the biggest upgrade from the last

806
00:51:43,785 --> 00:51:47,625
Speaker 9:  generation to the next. So the difference between it and

807
00:51:47,705 --> 00:51:51,305
Speaker 9:  a series watch is almost non-existent

808
00:51:51,305 --> 00:51:54,825
Speaker 9:  depending on what are the things that you care about. And the big thing that

809
00:51:54,985 --> 00:51:58,305
Speaker 9:  I was gonna say is the, was the major thing for the

810
00:51:59,245 --> 00:52:02,465
Speaker 9:  series 11 watch was the improvement in battery. And that was quite modest

811
00:52:02,965 --> 00:52:04,345
Speaker 9:  in my testing so far. Because

812
00:52:04,345 --> 00:52:07,065
Speaker 1:  You were excited about that when we saw the announcements, the jump from

813
00:52:07,545 --> 00:52:10,705
Speaker 1:  18 hours of rated battery life to 24 hours of rated battery life seems like.

814
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:13,865
Speaker 1:  And like you said last week, apple tends to underestimate those things. So

815
00:52:13,865 --> 00:52:17,545
Speaker 1:  like a six hour jump, which is what like a 33% leap in battery life could

816
00:52:17,545 --> 00:52:21,225
Speaker 1:  be a big deal. It's, it was a bummer to hear that it wasn't a big deal.

817
00:52:21,855 --> 00:52:25,785
Speaker 9:  It's more like the 24 hour battery life estimate is now more accurate,

818
00:52:26,815 --> 00:52:30,745
Speaker 9:  whereas, okay. Whereas the, like the 18 hour battery life estimate was I

819
00:52:30,745 --> 00:52:34,425
Speaker 9:  think inaccurate. It was quite low. And now I think

820
00:52:34,425 --> 00:52:38,305
Speaker 9:  24 hours is accurate, but still

821
00:52:38,505 --> 00:52:42,145
Speaker 9:  a little low. Just not very low. So I was getting around,

822
00:52:43,425 --> 00:52:46,585
Speaker 9:  I mean it's very hard to fully tell you what the battery life expectation

823
00:52:46,585 --> 00:52:50,225
Speaker 9:  is gonna be on the amount of time I've had testing three

824
00:52:50,225 --> 00:52:54,105
Speaker 9:  watches simultaneously on two wrists and you know, there's there

825
00:52:54,175 --> 00:52:57,945
Speaker 9:  it's, it's easier And I'll have a much better idea once I get to just wear

826
00:52:57,965 --> 00:53:01,425
Speaker 9:  one watch at a time for a longer period of a time instead of like switching

827
00:53:01,425 --> 00:53:05,105
Speaker 9:  between watches and wearing two watches on same wrist, which means it's switching

828
00:53:05,105 --> 00:53:07,985
Speaker 9:  between phones. So take what I say as nice, perfectly

829
00:53:07,985 --> 00:53:09,025
Speaker 1:  Normal use case that

830
00:53:09,145 --> 00:53:11,625
Speaker 9:  Everyone does all the time. Perfect use case that everyone does and is not

831
00:53:11,815 --> 00:53:15,025
Speaker 9:  like my specific thing. So I'm gonna say to like

832
00:53:16,075 --> 00:53:19,925
Speaker 9:  take this as my first crack at the battery testing, which

833
00:53:20,005 --> 00:53:23,565
Speaker 9:  I, you know, I have my whole process down to a pet I account for these things

834
00:53:25,145 --> 00:53:28,885
Speaker 9:  my first 24 48 hours with the Series 11.

835
00:53:29,285 --> 00:53:33,205
Speaker 9:  I got maybe about 28 to 30 hours on a single charge. Okay.

836
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:37,125
Speaker 9:  Which is better. It's better than 24 hours, but is it

837
00:53:37,305 --> 00:53:41,205
Speaker 9:  the 36 to 40 hours that I think people were hoping for? No, it's not.

838
00:53:41,415 --> 00:53:45,365
Speaker 9:  Right. So if you're on a series nine, if you're on a series

839
00:53:45,465 --> 00:53:48,605
Speaker 9:  10, what I think you're gonna find is that you don't have to worry quite

840
00:53:48,665 --> 00:53:52,365
Speaker 9:  as much. If you go to bed with less than ideal battery life, you'll wake

841
00:53:52,365 --> 00:53:56,125
Speaker 9:  up and you'll have like 3% left, that sort of thing. And you can hot

842
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:59,365
Speaker 9:  stick it on a charger. It goes zero to 80 in about 30 minutes. So,

843
00:54:00,065 --> 00:54:04,005
Speaker 9:  you know, it's, it's even more true that if you just stick it on

844
00:54:04,165 --> 00:54:06,725
Speaker 9:  a charger while you're getting it ready in the morning, you're good, you're

845
00:54:06,725 --> 00:54:10,485
Speaker 9:  good to go. You don't really have to think about it as much. But you know

846
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:14,685
Speaker 9:  that I can already hear the Garmin users going like, well

847
00:54:14,885 --> 00:54:18,805
Speaker 9:  I measure battery life not in hours but in weeks and months and this is ha

848
00:54:19,215 --> 00:54:21,005
Speaker 1:  We're thrilled for you. We really are.

849
00:54:21,155 --> 00:54:24,845
Speaker 9:  Yeah. And I, I love that for you guys. You guys are not gonna be impressed

850
00:54:24,865 --> 00:54:28,685
Speaker 9:  by this battery life change. But you know, if you are coming from a series

851
00:54:28,715 --> 00:54:32,565
Speaker 9:  five, a series six, And I am sure if you've had those watches, the

852
00:54:32,565 --> 00:54:36,005
Speaker 9:  battery has decorated since in a long time and you jump to this,

853
00:54:36,265 --> 00:54:39,485
Speaker 9:  you're gonna be pleased with the battery life that's available.

854
00:54:40,345 --> 00:54:44,045
Speaker 9:  But is it exciting? Is it exciting for me having worn the,

855
00:54:44,265 --> 00:54:48,165
Speaker 9:  the new iteration year after year? I'm like, oh it's, it's a little bit

856
00:54:48,165 --> 00:54:49,965
Speaker 9:  better than the Series 10. Just

857
00:54:50,005 --> 00:54:52,325
Speaker 1:  A lot. Well I think the, the thing I think is interesting about this is my,

858
00:54:52,345 --> 00:54:55,685
Speaker 1:  my sense from talking to people over the years is that the idea

859
00:54:56,625 --> 00:55:00,085
Speaker 1:  of upgrading your watch every year is essentially

860
00:55:00,085 --> 00:55:03,445
Speaker 1:  non-existent. Like I, I know, I know a lot of people who are like, I get

861
00:55:03,445 --> 00:55:05,965
Speaker 1:  every other phone because I like phones and want the new stuff or whatever.

862
00:55:06,125 --> 00:55:08,285
Speaker 1:  I know people who get every phone because they're like, I like the new stuff.

863
00:55:08,445 --> 00:55:12,205
Speaker 1:  I don't know anyone who is like I get every watch every year that's just

864
00:55:12,265 --> 00:55:14,485
Speaker 1:  Parker. You wear your watch until it doesn't work anymore and then you get

865
00:55:14,485 --> 00:55:18,045
Speaker 1:  a new watch. And so I think that makes this sort of iterative

866
00:55:18,045 --> 00:55:21,845
Speaker 1:  upgrade cadence to me even more acceptable on the watch

867
00:55:21,845 --> 00:55:23,205
Speaker 1:  than on some of these other devices.

868
00:55:23,595 --> 00:55:27,325
Speaker 9:  Yeah. Because when you are, when it is time for you to upgrade all of these

869
00:55:27,495 --> 00:55:31,405
Speaker 9:  small changes, they do add up to something big. But I really do

870
00:55:31,405 --> 00:55:32,765
Speaker 9:  think that the SE three,

871
00:55:34,425 --> 00:55:38,205
Speaker 9:  that's just on every single level, if you have an SE two

872
00:55:38,545 --> 00:55:42,005
Speaker 9:  on every single level except bezels, this has been improved.

873
00:55:42,905 --> 00:55:46,165
Speaker 9:  The bezels are still bezels, but if you've been on the se you don't know

874
00:55:46,165 --> 00:55:49,805
Speaker 9:  what you're missing with non bezels. So it's, it's a really great

875
00:55:50,495 --> 00:55:54,285
Speaker 9:  thing. And the only thing that's new that I think

876
00:55:54,385 --> 00:55:58,085
Speaker 9:  the SC three is not getting is the hypertension notifications,

877
00:55:58,135 --> 00:56:02,125
Speaker 9:  which I can't really talk about because it rolled out yesterday. And so I

878
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:05,965
Speaker 9:  am testing that in real time with everybody else who got the watch OS 26

879
00:56:05,965 --> 00:56:09,085
Speaker 9:  update. Which to my point as to why the

880
00:56:09,585 --> 00:56:13,565
Speaker 9:  Series 11 feels like it's the middle child of Apple Watches is

881
00:56:13,565 --> 00:56:16,925
Speaker 9:  that everything that's new and cool that has come to this watch is not

882
00:56:16,995 --> 00:56:20,845
Speaker 9:  exclusive to this watch. Right. Either the Ultra three has it or

883
00:56:20,865 --> 00:56:24,485
Speaker 9:  the SE three has it or the Apple Watch Series nine

884
00:56:24,945 --> 00:56:28,605
Speaker 9:  10 and ultra two also have it. So you're just kind of like,

885
00:56:28,825 --> 00:56:32,765
Speaker 9:  eh, 'cause the SE three, it's got an always on display, it has

886
00:56:32,765 --> 00:56:36,725
Speaker 9:  the pinchy pension, the flippy flip, so it has those gestures

887
00:56:36,725 --> 00:56:40,325
Speaker 9:  and those were the two things that I really felt

888
00:56:40,555 --> 00:56:44,445
Speaker 9:  were kind of deal breakers for me on an SE versus a series. Well they have

889
00:56:44,445 --> 00:56:44,565
Speaker 9:  them.

890
00:56:44,835 --> 00:56:48,285
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And to be clear, the thing where a bunch of old watches are also getting

891
00:56:48,285 --> 00:56:52,085
Speaker 1:  all the new features, unbelievably good news. This is, this is great. Incredible,

892
00:56:52,085 --> 00:56:54,925
Speaker 1:  incredible. It just means you probably most, most people with recent watches

893
00:56:55,365 --> 00:56:58,285
Speaker 1:  probably don't need the new one. But wait, in terms of the new things on

894
00:56:58,285 --> 00:57:02,205
Speaker 1:  the se I want you to rank four features for me in terms of how

895
00:57:02,205 --> 00:57:02,965
Speaker 1:  big a deal they are.

896
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:08,325
Speaker 1:  The four features are fast charging, the always on

897
00:57:08,325 --> 00:57:12,295
Speaker 1:  display, 5G and the battery life improvements.

898
00:57:13,295 --> 00:57:15,935
Speaker 1:  I, I have a ranking in my head of how much I care about each of those things,

899
00:57:15,935 --> 00:57:19,215
Speaker 1:  but I want you to rank them for me. So fast charging always on display, 5G

900
00:57:19,215 --> 00:57:19,775
Speaker 1:  battery life

901
00:57:19,995 --> 00:57:21,855
Speaker 9:  Always on display number one. Okay.

902
00:57:24,625 --> 00:57:28,195
Speaker 9:  What were the other three? So always on display number one 5G

903
00:57:28,615 --> 00:57:30,795
Speaker 9:  at the very bottom. Okay. And the other two were

904
00:57:31,055 --> 00:57:33,195
Speaker 1:  Always on fast charging and battery life.

905
00:57:33,385 --> 00:57:37,155
Speaker 9:  Fast charging is number two. And then battery life is

906
00:57:37,455 --> 00:57:41,155
Speaker 9:  number three. Okay. Because the battery life is still 18 hours.

907
00:57:41,505 --> 00:57:44,595
Speaker 9:  It's pretty, it's a pretty good 18 hours. I, I must say, so I was on a 13

908
00:57:44,595 --> 00:57:47,515
Speaker 9:  hour flight. I started that flight with maybe about

909
00:57:47,515 --> 00:57:51,115
Speaker 9:  87% battery And I got home and it was at 27.

910
00:57:51,695 --> 00:57:55,675
Speaker 9:  So, or not 13 hour flight, but 'cause at the time change difference

911
00:57:55,785 --> 00:57:59,355
Speaker 9:  from when I got onto the, to the, to the flight and, and

912
00:58:00,805 --> 00:58:04,265
Speaker 9:  it was, it, it was, it it it went from 87 to

913
00:58:04,265 --> 00:58:07,985
Speaker 9:  27. Sure. And I think that's pretty great. Stuck it on the charger for 10

914
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,385
Speaker 9:  minutes, went back up to 37.

915
00:58:11,165 --> 00:58:14,505
Speaker 9:  You know, it's, it's, it's fine. You're gonna have to baby it a bit more.

916
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:19,265
Speaker 9:  What happens there is that it's, it's just doesn't have as

917
00:58:19,265 --> 00:58:22,985
Speaker 9:  much capacity for, for the battery life. But because you have fast charging,

918
00:58:23,685 --> 00:58:27,025
Speaker 9:  the sting is taken out because the last se didn't have fast charging. Usually

919
00:58:27,085 --> 00:58:29,545
Speaker 9:  we have to sit there and wait for your watch to charge. Right. That took

920
00:58:29,665 --> 00:58:33,385
Speaker 9:  a a while. The fast charging is not as fast as on the se

921
00:58:33,965 --> 00:58:37,865
Speaker 9:  as on the Series 11. It's I think zero to 80

922
00:58:37,885 --> 00:58:41,865
Speaker 9:  and 45 minutes as opposed to zero to 80 and 30. So you do have to

923
00:58:41,865 --> 00:58:45,825
Speaker 9:  wait a bit longer. Yeah. But it's, it's not so bad

924
00:58:45,825 --> 00:58:49,705
Speaker 9:  really, it it, it's just kind of like now that the fast charging is

925
00:58:49,705 --> 00:58:53,665
Speaker 9:  there, you don't mind the lesser capacity quite as

926
00:58:53,665 --> 00:58:57,545
Speaker 9:  much. Whereas if you don't have the capacity and you don't have fast

927
00:58:57,705 --> 00:59:00,185
Speaker 9:  charging, you're just sitting there watching at that wa looking at that watch

928
00:59:00,185 --> 00:59:00,985
Speaker 9:  and going faster.

929
00:59:01,685 --> 00:59:05,545
Speaker 1:  Yes, a hundred percent. And it is, it is the thing there is, there is a amount

930
00:59:05,545 --> 00:59:09,425
Speaker 1:  of time, And I think it's probably an hour where if my watch takes

931
00:59:09,425 --> 00:59:13,345
Speaker 1:  more than an hour to charge, there's a strong chance I'm just gonna forget

932
00:59:13,345 --> 00:59:17,105
Speaker 1:  about it. This literally happened to me yesterday. I I, my watch

933
00:59:17,285 --> 00:59:21,185
Speaker 1:  was almost dead. I put it down to charge on my incredibly

934
00:59:21,315 --> 00:59:23,245
Speaker 1:  slow charger that I've complained about on this show before,

935
00:59:24,915 --> 00:59:28,325
Speaker 1:  just flatly forgot about it for 24 hours, just didn't put it on. And it's

936
00:59:28,325 --> 00:59:32,245
Speaker 1:  like, that's, that's the thing that Apple can't have happened, right? Yeah.

937
00:59:32,245 --> 00:59:35,005
Speaker 1:  It's like these, these things can't just like die in a drawer somewhere or

938
00:59:35,005 --> 00:59:37,485
Speaker 1:  else it all falls apart. So I agree. I would, I would rank them the same

939
00:59:37,485 --> 00:59:41,325
Speaker 1:  way. And I actually think seeing what you saw about the fast charging, which

940
00:59:41,325 --> 00:59:44,885
Speaker 1:  is that it's not like, you know, blistering, but it is like

941
00:59:45,385 --> 00:59:49,205
Speaker 1:  put it down while you're making coffee in the morning and it is going to

942
00:59:49,205 --> 00:59:51,965
Speaker 1:  meaningfully charge enough to potentially get you through the rest of the

943
00:59:51,965 --> 00:59:54,405
Speaker 1:  day. Like that's pretty exciting. That goes a long way for me.

944
00:59:54,705 --> 00:59:58,685
Speaker 9:  It goes a, a huge way. So it's really a question of whether do you

945
00:59:58,685 --> 01:00:02,045
Speaker 9:  want a bigger screen with smaller bezels and

946
01:00:02,505 --> 01:00:06,205
Speaker 9:  the whole entire health suite of features or if you're like,

947
01:00:06,545 --> 01:00:09,325
Speaker 9:  you can keep that, I'm gonna save

948
01:00:09,445 --> 01:00:13,365
Speaker 9:  $150 and the bezels are, I'll just use one of

949
01:00:13,365 --> 01:00:16,765
Speaker 9:  those black backgrounds so I don't notice them at all. Right? Like it, that's

950
01:00:16,765 --> 01:00:19,405
Speaker 9:  sort of like what is the trade off there for you? And

951
01:00:20,725 --> 01:00:24,345
Speaker 9:  The Vergecast listeners I suspect will be like, I will pay for the little

952
01:00:24,345 --> 01:00:28,225
Speaker 9:  bit of Polish madam. Sure. But I think the

953
01:00:28,225 --> 01:00:31,985
Speaker 9:  average person, the, the vast majority of people, people who have not been

954
01:00:32,055 --> 01:00:35,705
Speaker 9:  totally sold by the smartwatch idea, they're gonna look at the

955
01:00:35,885 --> 01:00:39,265
Speaker 9:  SE three and go like whatever, I'll save 120 to

956
01:00:39,305 --> 01:00:43,105
Speaker 9:  150 depending on the size that you want. And my recommendation actually for

957
01:00:43,105 --> 01:00:46,705
Speaker 9:  people who are bothered by bezels is to go up to the 44

958
01:00:48,545 --> 01:00:52,385
Speaker 9:  millimeter size on the SE three because if you compare the active display

959
01:00:52,385 --> 01:00:56,145
Speaker 9:  area, it's similar to the 42 millimeter series 11. So

960
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:59,945
Speaker 9:  if you think about it that way and you trick yourself into

961
01:01:00,235 --> 01:01:04,145
Speaker 9:  using the black backgrounds a bit more, you're really not gonna

962
01:01:04,145 --> 01:01:05,585
Speaker 9:  notice that stuff quite as much.

963
01:01:06,215 --> 01:01:10,125
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Yeah. I've, I've come to think of it as like, I think looking at it

964
01:01:10,265 --> 01:01:13,725
Speaker 1:  now, apple just got the naming scheme of the watch

965
01:01:14,055 --> 01:01:17,885
Speaker 1:  wrong. That actually what it is is is 'cause the SE

966
01:01:17,885 --> 01:01:20,685
Speaker 1:  typically, like when you think about The iPhone se it refers to something

967
01:01:21,635 --> 01:01:25,605
Speaker 1:  less, right? Yeah. It is not the base model, it is a specific thing for a

968
01:01:25,725 --> 01:01:28,805
Speaker 1:  specific group of people. And even the watch SE was that for a minute it

969
01:01:28,805 --> 01:01:31,925
Speaker 1:  was a very much like Fisher-Price, my first smartwatch kind of smartwatch.

970
01:01:31,925 --> 01:01:35,485
Speaker 1:  Yeah. It's not that anymore. So now I think about it as like the SE is the

971
01:01:35,485 --> 01:01:39,205
Speaker 1:  watch, the Series is the pro and the Ultra is the Ultra and that like,

972
01:01:39,635 --> 01:01:43,525
Speaker 1:  that frames it better for me and is like, this is the, the SE

973
01:01:43,525 --> 01:01:47,205
Speaker 1:  is the mainstream watch in the way that The iPhone

974
01:01:47,445 --> 01:01:50,725
Speaker 1:  17 is the mainstream iPhone. And then if you want it to do

975
01:01:51,235 --> 01:01:54,645
Speaker 1:  more sort of nichey stuff, you scale up and if you want it to do more nichey

976
01:01:54,645 --> 01:01:58,605
Speaker 1:  stuff, you scale up again. But like most people who just like

977
01:01:58,605 --> 01:02:01,765
Speaker 1:  want a smartwatch and don't have further questions about how they're going

978
01:02:01,765 --> 01:02:05,295
Speaker 1:  to use it, the SE is going to be enough, right?

979
01:02:05,545 --> 01:02:08,695
Speaker 9:  Thees is gonna be more than enough because what are the health features really

980
01:02:08,835 --> 01:02:12,575
Speaker 9:  at this point in time that you are gonna be missing out on? Because the

981
01:02:12,775 --> 01:02:16,375
Speaker 9:  SE three, they added the risk temperature sensor, you are getting the vast

982
01:02:16,735 --> 01:02:19,525
Speaker 9:  majority of the health features on there. So what you're, you're missing

983
01:02:19,705 --> 01:02:23,685
Speaker 9:  is the EKGs, And I wanna be clear with the EKGs,

984
01:02:23,685 --> 01:02:27,405
Speaker 9:  you're only missing then spot checks for AFib

985
01:02:27,405 --> 01:02:31,325
Speaker 9:  detection because the irregular heart rhythm notifications, which I

986
01:02:31,325 --> 01:02:35,205
Speaker 9:  call the passive AFib, like checking. So you'll

987
01:02:35,205 --> 01:02:38,365
Speaker 9:  get a notification being like, hmm, we've detected some irregular heart rhythm

988
01:02:38,365 --> 01:02:41,485
Speaker 9:  notification that's on the SE three now. So if you're worried about AFib

989
01:02:42,075 --> 01:02:45,925
Speaker 9:  that you can get the passive notifications via the, the SE three.

990
01:02:46,185 --> 01:02:49,765
Speaker 9:  So it's just the spot checking with the EKG blood

991
01:02:49,785 --> 01:02:53,365
Speaker 9:  oxygen which was missing on all the watches sold in the US for the last 18

992
01:02:53,365 --> 01:02:57,245
Speaker 9:  months until recently. So really I don't, I, I know there are

993
01:02:57,245 --> 01:02:59,445
Speaker 9:  some people who have reached out to me being like, no, I really care about

994
01:02:59,445 --> 01:03:03,285
Speaker 9:  that feature And I believe that is true for a certain subsect of

995
01:03:03,285 --> 01:03:06,845
Speaker 9:  people, but for the vast majority of people you didn't know it was there

996
01:03:07,025 --> 01:03:10,845
Speaker 9:  and you didn't miss it. And the hypertension notifications, which I cannot

997
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:14,845
Speaker 9:  responsibly talk about because I have only used it for one

998
01:03:14,845 --> 01:03:18,805
Speaker 9:  night or like one day. But you know, I think that

999
01:03:18,805 --> 01:03:22,645
Speaker 9:  could be a very useful screening tool. But at the same time,

1000
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:26,045
Speaker 9:  if you are on the relatively younger side, if you're not really worried about

1001
01:03:26,045 --> 01:03:29,805
Speaker 9:  hypertension at this point in your life, again, it's very possible that

1002
01:03:29,825 --> 01:03:33,445
Speaker 9:  you will never, ever interact with that feature. Right. So

1003
01:03:34,235 --> 01:03:37,775
Speaker 9:  are you gonna miss it? I don't think so. If you're older, that might be a

1004
01:03:37,775 --> 01:03:41,615
Speaker 9:  thing that you want to keep a track of. If you have a history, a family

1005
01:03:41,615 --> 01:03:45,295
Speaker 9:  history of blood pressure, high blood pressure, that might be a thing that

1006
01:03:45,395 --> 01:03:49,295
Speaker 9:  is a little bit of peace of mind or, or maybe not peace of mind, a

1007
01:03:49,295 --> 01:03:52,935
Speaker 9:  health anxiety that you wanna sign up for sure. But sleep apnea

1008
01:03:52,935 --> 01:03:56,855
Speaker 9:  notifications, sleep score, which is the new thing, all

1009
01:03:56,855 --> 01:03:59,775
Speaker 9:  of that stuff is coming to the SE three. So really the three things that

1010
01:03:59,775 --> 01:04:03,175
Speaker 9:  I mentioned are the only health features as of this point in time

1011
01:04:03,765 --> 01:04:07,055
Speaker 9:  that you're gonna be missing out on. And you know, the SE doesn't get updated

1012
01:04:07,055 --> 01:04:10,935
Speaker 9:  every single year. It could be that for the Series 12, they're like, we did

1013
01:04:10,935 --> 01:04:14,855
Speaker 9:  it guys, we figured out non-invasive blood glucose monitoring. I will

1014
01:04:14,855 --> 01:04:18,015
Speaker 9:  eat my shoe if that happens in a year. But you know, they could say that

1015
01:04:18,015 --> 01:04:21,335
Speaker 9:  that's the thing and then you're like, ah, I've got an SE three, but

1016
01:04:21,795 --> 01:04:25,055
Speaker 9:  that's not a right now problem. And if you're thinking about upgrading right

1017
01:04:25,055 --> 01:04:25,255
Speaker 9:  now,

1018
01:04:26,815 --> 01:04:28,735
Speaker 9:  I just laid it out for you. So Yeah. Right.

1019
01:04:28,835 --> 01:04:32,375
Speaker 1:  And yeah, I would say there is very little evidence to suggest that there

1020
01:04:32,375 --> 01:04:36,215
Speaker 1:  is some gigantic groundbreaking thing coming next year. Yeah, this is, this

1021
01:04:36,215 --> 01:04:38,735
Speaker 1:  is a thing everybody says every year and it's like, just if you want the

1022
01:04:38,735 --> 01:04:41,175
Speaker 1:  thing now, just buy the thing now it's gonna be fine. Yeah, yeah. It's gonna

1023
01:04:41,175 --> 01:04:44,495
Speaker 1:  be fine. Alright, so before I let you go, I do just kind of wanna walk up

1024
01:04:44,555 --> 01:04:48,535
Speaker 1:  the line of watches here because you've, you've used them all. You, you

1025
01:04:48,535 --> 01:04:52,055
Speaker 1:  have a, I think a sense of like what is for who. And so if we start with

1026
01:04:52,395 --> 01:04:56,175
Speaker 1:  the, the SE three, which I think is like the watch for most

1027
01:04:56,175 --> 01:04:59,695
Speaker 1:  people it is, it is the one you should start by looking at

1028
01:05:01,275 --> 01:05:05,215
Speaker 1:  you, you mentioned the health features, what else is there to sell me

1029
01:05:05,215 --> 01:05:08,615
Speaker 1:  on the Series 11? It's $150 more expensive. It goes from

1030
01:05:08,615 --> 01:05:12,575
Speaker 1:  2 49 to 3 99. What am I getting that I'm paying

1031
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:13,175
Speaker 1:  for bigger

1032
01:05:13,175 --> 01:05:16,655
Speaker 9:  Screen? So if like me, you have garbage eyeballs and

1033
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:20,485
Speaker 9:  you would really appreciate the larger space

1034
01:05:21,365 --> 01:05:25,225
Speaker 9:  that's there. If you are someone who's really like, ah, I'm gonna

1035
01:05:25,335 --> 01:05:29,145
Speaker 9:  stay up all night tossing and turning about bezels, that's the

1036
01:05:30,005 --> 01:05:33,825
Speaker 9:  series 11 as well. It is slightly thinner, like one millimeter

1037
01:05:33,825 --> 01:05:37,425
Speaker 9:  thinner if you're the princess and the P mattress type,

1038
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:41,345
Speaker 9:  maybe that'll be a thing that you notice if you are buying

1039
01:05:41,345 --> 01:05:45,265
Speaker 9:  this for your parents and for their health and you really wanna show that

1040
01:05:45,265 --> 01:05:49,225
Speaker 9:  you love your parents and that you want them to have the full suite of

1041
01:05:49,225 --> 01:05:52,985
Speaker 9:  health detection features and have that a future proof sort of thing. That's

1042
01:05:53,535 --> 01:05:56,705
Speaker 9:  that I think the Series 11 is gonna be a good choice for you.

1043
01:05:58,125 --> 01:06:01,785
Speaker 9:  That's about it. Oh, and if, if you really want,

1044
01:06:02,175 --> 01:06:06,025
Speaker 9:  when you're using the messaging feature, if you really want a little keyboard

1045
01:06:06,215 --> 01:06:09,585
Speaker 9:  that is not accommodated at all on the E three,

1046
01:06:10,565 --> 01:06:14,545
Speaker 9:  you're gonna need the Series 11 for that. I don't know anyone

1047
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:15,905
Speaker 9:  who is super

1048
01:06:17,425 --> 01:06:21,225
Speaker 9:  invested in the key. I I mostly call this up because I had one person ask

1049
01:06:21,225 --> 01:06:24,425
Speaker 9:  me online is like, is the keyboard there? And I was like, I'll find out for

1050
01:06:24,425 --> 01:06:27,825
Speaker 9:  you one person. But no, the keyboard is not there on the SE three.

1051
01:06:28,205 --> 01:06:31,385
Speaker 9:  So if you really love that keyboard and typing via

1052
01:06:32,305 --> 01:06:36,225
Speaker 9:  a keyboard on your Apple watch, that is a reason to get the

1053
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:36,785
Speaker 9:  Series 11.

1054
01:06:37,045 --> 01:06:40,265
Speaker 1:  And honestly if, if you are that person A, God bless, and

1055
01:06:40,385 --> 01:06:43,825
Speaker 1:  BI would like to know more about you, I will say

1056
01:06:44,165 --> 01:06:48,105
Speaker 1:  the, the tap backs, I've, the using a watch made me such a like

1057
01:06:48,465 --> 01:06:52,225
Speaker 1:  religious user of tap backs. It's perfect. It is the perfect messaging

1058
01:06:52,225 --> 01:06:55,585
Speaker 1:  feature for a smartwatch And I love it very much. Okay, so

1059
01:06:56,535 --> 01:07:00,385
Speaker 1:  then we jump to the Ultra, which you're, you're still testing and

1060
01:07:00,385 --> 01:07:04,345
Speaker 1:  still reviewing. Yes. The is is it as simple

1061
01:07:04,825 --> 01:07:08,745
Speaker 1:  a case there as it has been in recent years, which is it's bigger and it

1062
01:07:08,745 --> 01:07:09,745
Speaker 1:  is more outdoorsy.

1063
01:07:10,365 --> 01:07:14,065
Speaker 9:  Yep, that's, there you go. There's satellite connectivity now.

1064
01:07:14,445 --> 01:07:14,665
Speaker 9:  Yay.

1065
01:07:14,665 --> 01:07:17,865
Speaker 1:  Yeah, I mean that's something I will say in the, in the we, we talked about

1066
01:07:17,865 --> 01:07:20,785
Speaker 1:  this last week, right? That I think like ultra people are sort of self-selecting.

1067
01:07:20,785 --> 01:07:23,265
Speaker 1:  Like you, you either are one or you're not, either aesthetically or because

1068
01:07:23,265 --> 01:07:26,665
Speaker 1:  there's a feature, but I, we've, I I'm sure you have too, but I've heard

1069
01:07:26,665 --> 01:07:29,025
Speaker 1:  from some people who are like, you don't understand the satellite connectivity

1070
01:07:29,025 --> 01:07:32,105
Speaker 1:  thing is huge. Like, it, it it is huge. It makes this thing

1071
01:07:32,635 --> 01:07:36,505
Speaker 1:  compelling for a whole new kind of purpose for this niche of

1072
01:07:36,505 --> 01:07:36,665
Speaker 1:  people.

1073
01:07:37,085 --> 01:07:40,825
Speaker 9:  For that niche of people. Satellite con connectivity is big. Is it gonna

1074
01:07:40,975 --> 01:07:44,705
Speaker 9:  replace the garment in reach for like the really serious through hikers,

1075
01:07:44,705 --> 01:07:48,545
Speaker 9:  right? No, because the battery life is not, it's just not there

1076
01:07:48,685 --> 01:07:52,465
Speaker 9:  for that. But if you are on a weekend hike going off the

1077
01:07:52,465 --> 01:07:56,385
Speaker 9:  grid, it's there. It's, it's there and it's helpful for you and you

1078
01:07:56,385 --> 01:07:59,425
Speaker 9:  don't need an extra subscription to use it, which is big. So for like the

1079
01:07:59,425 --> 01:08:01,065
Speaker 9:  Weekend Warriors, I think this is a big,

1080
01:08:02,615 --> 01:08:06,585
Speaker 9:  it's a big upgrade that gives them a little more flexibility in what

1081
01:08:06,585 --> 01:08:09,545
Speaker 9:  gear they wanna carry. If they wanna be a little bit more minimalist, they

1082
01:08:09,605 --> 01:08:10,025
Speaker 9:  can be,

1083
01:08:11,885 --> 01:08:15,725
Speaker 9:  you know, having 5G cellular, I mean they touted it

1084
01:08:15,725 --> 01:08:19,525
Speaker 9:  as this thing, which is, don't get me wrong, if you have the 5G coverage,

1085
01:08:19,525 --> 01:08:23,485
Speaker 9:  that's great, but it's 5G MLTE on the all three watches

1086
01:08:23,555 --> 01:08:27,445
Speaker 9:  have it though. So it's not that different from the Series 11 to the

1087
01:08:27,495 --> 01:08:31,005
Speaker 9:  Ultra in terms of the coverage for the, for the cellular, the, the main difference

1088
01:08:31,005 --> 01:08:34,805
Speaker 9:  is that, you know, there's a different antenna for, for the two higher

1089
01:08:34,905 --> 01:08:38,685
Speaker 9:  end watches. So in the edge cases where

1090
01:08:38,705 --> 01:08:42,435
Speaker 9:  things are dropping out a little bit, it'll be a little bit better

1091
01:08:42,435 --> 01:08:46,315
Speaker 9:  because it has this redesigned antenna whereas it's just regular 5G

1092
01:08:46,735 --> 01:08:50,555
Speaker 9:  and LTE on the, the se the number of people who I think this will truly

1093
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:54,675
Speaker 9:  affect this minuscule, right? Is it,

1094
01:08:54,745 --> 01:08:58,675
Speaker 9:  it's just like how often do you download stuff directly onto your watch versus

1095
01:08:58,805 --> 01:09:02,715
Speaker 9:  doing it at home where you have wifi and your phone connected to it? I

1096
01:09:03,155 --> 01:09:06,155
Speaker 9:  I think for most people the 5G is not gonna be

1097
01:09:07,475 --> 01:09:10,915
Speaker 9:  a game changer or a life changing unless you're the

1098
01:09:10,915 --> 01:09:14,165
Speaker 9:  heaviest of cellular users. Cool.

1099
01:09:14,745 --> 01:09:18,165
Speaker 9:  The Ultra is still the Ultra I compared my ultra two

1100
01:09:18,585 --> 01:09:22,485
Speaker 9:  to my ultra three. And again garbage

1101
01:09:22,565 --> 01:09:25,405
Speaker 9:  eyeballs, I was really truly like, I guess it's

1102
01:09:26,725 --> 01:09:30,165
Speaker 9:  minuscule smaller the bezels. Sure.

1103
01:09:30,795 --> 01:09:31,085
Speaker 9:  Like

1104
01:09:31,475 --> 01:09:34,245
Speaker 1:  Sure it's not gonna change your life. This is what you're saying.

1105
01:09:34,245 --> 01:09:37,685
Speaker 9:  It's no, yeah, it's mostly for people. If you don't have and Ultra yet, it's

1106
01:09:37,845 --> 01:09:39,125
Speaker 9:  slightly better. Yay. Sure.

1107
01:09:39,555 --> 01:09:43,525
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Yeah, I think so. I, I have a series eight that is

1108
01:09:43,525 --> 01:09:46,325
Speaker 1:  finally kind of starting to show and feel its age and

1109
01:09:47,425 --> 01:09:50,685
Speaker 1:  I'm, I'm like, I, I've been debating like am I ready to become and Ultra

1110
01:09:50,685 --> 01:09:54,565
Speaker 1:  person just for the sheer screen size alone? And I think the

1111
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:57,845
Speaker 1:  answer's no. I think I'm, I think I'm going se this year, but I want cellular.

1112
01:09:58,035 --> 01:10:01,685
Speaker 1:  Like I'm, I am, as much as everyone on our team keeps trying to be like,

1113
01:10:01,825 --> 01:10:04,685
Speaker 1:  I'm gonna live a smartwatch only life and it's a total disaster.

1114
01:10:05,705 --> 01:10:08,845
Speaker 1:  I'm gonna live a smartwatch only life and it's gonna be sick, I can't wait.

1115
01:10:09,165 --> 01:10:13,005
Speaker 9:  I, I would just say get the 44 because you are a tech nerd. So I do think

1116
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:16,085
Speaker 9:  if you were to go for the 40 and you saw those bezels, you would be like,

1117
01:10:16,085 --> 01:10:16,525
Speaker 9:  what is this?

1118
01:10:16,695 --> 01:10:19,845
Speaker 1:  40 feels small I think, let me look at mine. Mine is, I think

1119
01:10:20,655 --> 01:10:23,055
Speaker 1:  I have the 45 right now. So I think I would probably go 44.

1120
01:10:23,055 --> 01:10:26,855
Speaker 9:  Yeah, go 44. The bezel situation, just use the

1121
01:10:26,855 --> 01:10:30,775
Speaker 9:  dark watch faces. Trick yourself into not thinking

1122
01:10:30,775 --> 01:10:34,695
Speaker 9:  that's there because I have the 40 millimeter se and when I did see

1123
01:10:34,695 --> 01:10:38,535
Speaker 9:  the icons I was like, what is this smart watch for ants? I can't see

1124
01:10:38,975 --> 01:10:42,335
Speaker 9:  anything. Good lord. Especially because watch it West 26

1125
01:10:42,495 --> 01:10:46,455
Speaker 9:  improves the smart stack so that you have a tiny icon that pops up when

1126
01:10:46,455 --> 01:10:50,175
Speaker 9:  there's a relevant suggestion in the smart stack. So

1127
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:54,335
Speaker 9:  the example I've been using is you open your camera on your phone and a

1128
01:10:54,335 --> 01:10:57,375
Speaker 9:  little camera icon's gonna pop up and then you pinchy pinch and then you

1129
01:10:57,375 --> 01:11:00,975
Speaker 9:  can open up the, the camera remote. 'cause it shows up in the, it's very

1130
01:11:00,975 --> 01:11:04,575
Speaker 9:  neat, it's very contextual. When that happened on the, on the 40

1131
01:11:04,855 --> 01:11:08,815
Speaker 9:  millimeter And I had just switched from and Ultra two to a SE

1132
01:11:08,825 --> 01:11:12,735
Speaker 9:  three, I was like, what is this icon? Oh, put it

1133
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:16,175
Speaker 9:  right next to my eyeball. That's what it is like. But again,

1134
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:20,335
Speaker 9:  terrible eyesight. If you have 2020 eyesight, you're probably fine.

1135
01:11:20,835 --> 01:11:22,895
Speaker 9:  So yeah, this is a me problem. Yeah,

1136
01:11:22,925 --> 01:11:26,015
Speaker 1:  Fair enough. All right, last question. Are you using the flow

1137
01:11:26,745 --> 01:11:27,335
Speaker 1:  watch face?

1138
01:11:28,145 --> 01:11:32,125
Speaker 9:  Yes, I'm, I am. In fact I like it. I think it's very

1139
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:35,165
Speaker 9:  minimalist. I think it's pretty, I love pink and purple and it's now pink

1140
01:11:35,165 --> 01:11:38,765
Speaker 9:  and purple on my wrist. Liquid glass

1141
01:11:39,265 --> 01:11:43,085
Speaker 9:  is liquid ass on the phone in my opinion, but on the watch it's

1142
01:11:43,085 --> 01:11:44,245
Speaker 9:  fine. Like it's,

1143
01:11:44,545 --> 01:11:48,125
Speaker 1:  See I totally disagree. I think it is like, I think it is more

1144
01:11:48,125 --> 01:11:51,565
Speaker 1:  offensive on the watch than almost anywhere because it's like I'm,

1145
01:11:51,905 --> 01:11:54,645
Speaker 1:  my problem with the flow watch face, I'm looking at it right now is like,

1146
01:11:54,675 --> 01:11:58,485
Speaker 1:  it's, it's pretty and it's charming and it is like borderline

1147
01:11:59,095 --> 01:12:02,965
Speaker 1:  unreadable and it's like, what I actually want from my watch is just

1148
01:12:02,965 --> 01:12:06,845
Speaker 1:  to show me the time all the time and, and ironically when it's

1149
01:12:06,945 --> 01:12:09,845
Speaker 1:  off and you're just glancing at it from the side when it just has the black

1150
01:12:09,845 --> 01:12:13,645
Speaker 1:  background, it's very readable and, and nice and translucent in a cool way.

1151
01:12:14,105 --> 01:12:16,565
Speaker 1:  You turn it on, it, it breaks, I don't like it.

1152
01:12:16,985 --> 01:12:20,565
Speaker 9:  Here's my hack, David hit me. You can go edit that watch face and turn off

1153
01:12:20,565 --> 01:12:24,455
Speaker 9:  the background so that it's never on. And then you just have the nice always

1154
01:12:24,455 --> 01:12:25,055
Speaker 9:  off look

1155
01:12:26,245 --> 01:12:29,835
Speaker 1:  Completely. I mean this is, this is such, the story of liquid glass is like,

1156
01:12:29,835 --> 01:12:32,875
Speaker 1:  if you just turn off like most of its features, it's pretty great.

1157
01:12:33,635 --> 01:12:37,455
Speaker 1:  And look now I've made it incredibly boring, but way more readable.

1158
01:12:37,635 --> 01:12:40,255
Speaker 1:  Thanks a lot Apple. We're doing great here. Yeah, yeah. Everybody,

1159
01:12:40,255 --> 01:12:41,535
Speaker 9:  Everybody, you're, everybody's killing

1160
01:12:41,535 --> 01:12:41,615
Speaker 1:  It

1161
01:12:42,395 --> 01:12:42,615
Speaker 9:  All.

1162
01:12:42,685 --> 01:12:46,455
Speaker 1:  It's fine as always. Turn off most of the features, it'll be fine. The the

1163
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:47,775
Speaker 1:  OS 26 story

1164
01:12:48,615 --> 01:12:52,495
Speaker 9:  I that and if you turn off most of the features, your battery life will

1165
01:12:52,495 --> 01:12:53,295
Speaker 9:  improve. So

1166
01:12:53,965 --> 01:12:56,815
Speaker 1:  Also true. That's a fair point. All right. You've, you've convinced me. All

1167
01:12:56,815 --> 01:12:59,055
Speaker 1:  right V you have smart glasses to go play with I'm sure.

1168
01:12:59,075 --> 01:13:02,215
Speaker 9:  So I have so many and just gonna, this is just gonna be me all day. Smart

1169
01:13:02,215 --> 01:13:02,735
Speaker 9:  glasses V.

1170
01:13:03,875 --> 01:13:06,655
Speaker 1:  All right, we gotta take a break anyway, V thank you. We'll be right back.

1171
01:15:35,105 --> 01:15:37,765
Speaker 1:  All right, we're back. Let's get to a question from The Vergecast hotline

1172
01:15:37,905 --> 01:15:41,365
Speaker 1:  as always. The number is 8 6 6 VERGE one one. The email is Vergecast at The

1173
01:15:41,405 --> 01:15:44,965
Speaker 1:  Verge dot com. We love hearing all of your questions. This one is about Apple

1174
01:15:44,965 --> 01:15:48,245
Speaker 1:  because that's what we're doing here this week, but it's about a thing Apple

1175
01:15:48,425 --> 01:15:51,685
Speaker 1:  hasn't talked all that much about recently, which is ai. It's from Nathan

1176
01:15:51,835 --> 01:15:52,325
Speaker 1:  here, it's,

1177
01:15:53,065 --> 01:15:56,605
Speaker 15:  Hey friends, this is Nathan. This is probably a,

1178
01:15:57,665 --> 01:16:01,525
Speaker 15:  not likely take, but with Apple and The iPhone

1179
01:16:01,765 --> 01:16:05,565
Speaker 15:  17 event, having AI like basically not

1180
01:16:05,565 --> 01:16:08,885
Speaker 15:  present at all. And I've been wondering this for a bit, like is there any

1181
01:16:08,885 --> 01:16:11,965
Speaker 15:  chance that Apple just doesn't believe in AI and

1182
01:16:12,635 --> 01:16:16,405
Speaker 15:  they're not failing at it, they're just not even really trying and they're

1183
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:20,005
Speaker 15:  just waiting for it to burn out? I don't know. Seems unlikely

1184
01:16:20,185 --> 01:16:23,525
Speaker 15:  but, and maybe that's optimistic of me but yep, thanks.

1185
01:16:23,915 --> 01:16:24,405
Speaker 15:  Alright,

1186
01:16:24,405 --> 01:16:28,045
Speaker 1:  So Nathan, I think the simplest version of the answer to your question is

1187
01:16:28,305 --> 01:16:32,285
Speaker 1:  no, I don't think Apple has given up on the idea that AI is important

1188
01:16:32,305 --> 01:16:36,165
Speaker 1:  and cool and exciting and is just waiting for it to burn out. I sort of love

1189
01:16:36,165 --> 01:16:39,325
Speaker 1:  that theory. It's a really fun conspiracy theory that would actually like

1190
01:16:39,325 --> 01:16:43,165
Speaker 1:  retroactively make a lot of apple's moves here. Make sense? But

1191
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:47,045
Speaker 1:  that is like Galaxy brand, even one level beyond what I'm capable of.

1192
01:16:47,065 --> 01:16:50,085
Speaker 1:  So I, I admire the take, but I don't think that's what's going on. But I

1193
01:16:50,085 --> 01:16:54,045
Speaker 1:  do wanna talk about kind of the, the framework I've developed for

1194
01:16:54,045 --> 01:16:56,805
Speaker 1:  listening to companies talk about AI because it's been really helpful for

1195
01:16:56,805 --> 01:17:00,565
Speaker 1:  me and it might be helpful for you too. So if you're a company in the world

1196
01:17:00,575 --> 01:17:04,525
Speaker 1:  right now, you have to talk about ai. You just do, especially if you're a

1197
01:17:04,525 --> 01:17:07,605
Speaker 1:  public company who once a quarter has to sit in front of investors and be

1198
01:17:07,605 --> 01:17:11,405
Speaker 1:  like, here is our plan for growth over time. That

1199
01:17:11,415 --> 01:17:14,485
Speaker 1:  story is just about AI right now. And if you don't talk about ai, somebody

1200
01:17:14,485 --> 01:17:17,245
Speaker 1:  will ask you about AI and if you don't have an answer about ai, they will

1201
01:17:17,245 --> 01:17:20,605
Speaker 1:  hammer your stock price. That's just a thing that happens. It is completely

1202
01:17:21,045 --> 01:17:25,005
Speaker 1:  divorced from the actual reality of whether AI is good or useful or valuable

1203
01:17:25,005 --> 01:17:28,845
Speaker 1:  or anybody wants it. That's just what's happening. So that is, that

1204
01:17:28,845 --> 01:17:32,685
Speaker 1:  is one side of the AI story And I think is important. You have to understand

1205
01:17:33,345 --> 01:17:36,885
Speaker 1:  how often these companies are talking to their investors

1206
01:17:37,425 --> 01:17:41,325
Speaker 1:  and how many of the things that they say are not about product, they're not

1207
01:17:41,325 --> 01:17:44,925
Speaker 1:  about thesis, about the future, they are about stock price.

1208
01:17:45,345 --> 01:17:49,065
Speaker 1:  And if you start looking at it that way, a lot of the tech industry gets

1209
01:17:49,065 --> 01:17:52,625
Speaker 1:  much bleecker and less fun. But I think it starts to make sense. So you,

1210
01:17:52,645 --> 01:17:56,585
Speaker 1:  you have, you have your story for investors, then I think you have your story

1211
01:17:57,085 --> 01:18:01,025
Speaker 1:  for users and the story for users for Apple

1212
01:18:01,485 --> 01:18:04,905
Speaker 1:  is actually really AI heavy and really

1213
01:18:04,905 --> 01:18:08,265
Speaker 1:  different from the way lots of other companies talk about ai. So

1214
01:18:08,735 --> 01:18:12,145
Speaker 1:  Apple's in an interesting place in that it's been doing a lot of really interesting,

1215
01:18:12,455 --> 01:18:16,305
Speaker 1:  like what it used to call machine learning things for a long time.

1216
01:18:16,395 --> 01:18:19,945
Speaker 1:  Apple is actually very clever about the ways that it uses

1217
01:18:20,485 --> 01:18:24,385
Speaker 1:  the on-device processing that your devices have to do things for you. Like

1218
01:18:24,385 --> 01:18:28,105
Speaker 1:  the the thing where you would pull down the notification shade

1219
01:18:28,445 --> 01:18:32,105
Speaker 1:  and start to search and right at the top it would give you

1220
01:18:32,255 --> 01:18:36,225
Speaker 1:  like four or eight suggested apps that it thinks you might wanna open.

1221
01:18:36,565 --> 01:18:39,145
Speaker 1:  That's contextual, right? It's dependent on what time of day and what you've

1222
01:18:39,145 --> 01:18:41,985
Speaker 1:  been doing recently and it's, it's a guess as to what it thinks you might

1223
01:18:41,985 --> 01:18:45,625
Speaker 1:  wanna be doing when you open your phone. That's ai. Like

1224
01:18:45,735 --> 01:18:49,265
Speaker 1:  they didn't call that AI because that wasn't the buzzword when this stuff

1225
01:18:49,265 --> 01:18:53,065
Speaker 1:  was coming out, but that's ai, Siri, all the stuff Siri has done

1226
01:18:53,065 --> 01:18:56,785
Speaker 1:  around your phone, good and bad is ai, like what the rest of the

1227
01:18:56,945 --> 01:19:00,905
Speaker 1:  industry is doing is this M ideas. We, we've been at this a long time

1228
01:19:00,965 --> 01:19:04,225
Speaker 1:  and so I think if you think about the way Apple has done clever

1229
01:19:04,355 --> 01:19:08,265
Speaker 1:  processing stuff in photos over time, the the thing where you could go and

1230
01:19:08,265 --> 01:19:11,665
Speaker 1:  search for a person and find your photos, like that's ai. This isn't like

1231
01:19:12,275 --> 01:19:15,745
Speaker 1:  novel groundbreaking stuff that Apple's doing, but it is, the stuff like

1232
01:19:15,985 --> 01:19:19,945
Speaker 1:  that is the technology. What's changed is that now everybody is obsessed

1233
01:19:19,945 --> 01:19:23,865
Speaker 1:  with this guy idea of like a God level chat bot that can do everything

1234
01:19:23,865 --> 01:19:27,745
Speaker 1:  for you. And we're all talking about age agentic. And so where Apple I think

1235
01:19:27,745 --> 01:19:31,585
Speaker 1:  has gone awry is by trying to catch

1236
01:19:31,645 --> 01:19:35,305
Speaker 1:  up on the buzzwords because everybody is obsessed with this one very

1237
01:19:35,305 --> 01:19:39,065
Speaker 1:  particular instantiation of ai, which is a a bot that I

1238
01:19:39,085 --> 01:19:42,585
Speaker 1:  ask a question and it goes and accomplishes things on my behalf. Everything

1239
01:19:42,585 --> 01:19:45,505
Speaker 1:  that I have seen and read and talked to people about suggests that that tech

1240
01:19:45,505 --> 01:19:49,145
Speaker 1:  doesn't work for anybody and there's not a ton of indication that it's going

1241
01:19:49,145 --> 01:19:52,385
Speaker 1:  to anytime soon. There are little bits of this agentic stuff that are starting

1242
01:19:52,385 --> 01:19:56,105
Speaker 1:  to work, but the idea that I'm just going to have like a magical

1243
01:19:56,135 --> 01:19:59,785
Speaker 1:  interface to the world that I just ask it to, I don't know,

1244
01:20:00,495 --> 01:20:04,225
Speaker 1:  fulfill all of my desires, I don't know, buy me groceries. It's like a thing

1245
01:20:04,225 --> 01:20:06,625
Speaker 1:  that all these companies want to be able to do And I just say like, Hey,

1246
01:20:07,025 --> 01:20:09,605
Speaker 1:  buy me groceries and it will go, it will figure out what I need. It will

1247
01:20:09,605 --> 01:20:12,125
Speaker 1:  figure out what it costs, it will figure out everything. It will meal plan

1248
01:20:12,125 --> 01:20:15,045
Speaker 1:  for me and it will, none of that works. I don't know. I don't know how to

1249
01:20:15,045 --> 01:20:18,765
Speaker 1:  be clear about that. None of that works and Apple is out over its

1250
01:20:18,795 --> 01:20:21,925
Speaker 1:  skis because it has to talk about that again because it has to make a case

1251
01:20:22,145 --> 01:20:25,645
Speaker 1:  to its investors that it is growing and is going to keep growing,

1252
01:20:26,935 --> 01:20:30,235
Speaker 1:  but none of it works. And so Apple is now in this tricky place where I think

1253
01:20:30,235 --> 01:20:33,995
Speaker 1:  what we've seen this year, And I think the thing that gives me hope

1254
01:20:34,095 --> 01:20:38,075
Speaker 1:  for what Apple is doing with AI is that a lot of the stuff at WW DC was

1255
01:20:38,095 --> 01:20:41,995
Speaker 1:  not like flashy AI first features where you're

1256
01:20:42,315 --> 01:20:46,195
Speaker 1:  interacting with the AI in order to do something. It's

1257
01:20:46,195 --> 01:20:49,395
Speaker 1:  just features like it's, it's just software. I think I, if you look around,

1258
01:20:50,085 --> 01:20:53,835
Speaker 1:  there are basically two kinds of ai. There's AI that is magical

1259
01:20:54,095 --> 01:20:57,835
Speaker 1:  God chatbots and there's AI that is software. And we're actually doing ourselves

1260
01:20:57,995 --> 01:21:01,875
Speaker 1:  a disservice by talking about them as the same thing because one side doesn't

1261
01:21:01,875 --> 01:21:05,475
Speaker 1:  work and might not, and also might be a total societal disaster. And the

1262
01:21:05,475 --> 01:21:08,915
Speaker 1:  other is actually going to meaningfully change the way that we interact with

1263
01:21:08,915 --> 01:21:12,575
Speaker 1:  our devices. And so Apple having these on device

1264
01:21:12,575 --> 01:21:16,455
Speaker 1:  models that it can use to help you do stuff

1265
01:21:16,515 --> 01:21:20,455
Speaker 1:  inside of your apps. We're seeing in iOS 26, a lot of devices are starting

1266
01:21:20,455 --> 01:21:24,215
Speaker 1:  to do this so that you can scan photos and pull text out of them. There's

1267
01:21:24,215 --> 01:21:27,375
Speaker 1:  this cool app called stuff that you can, you can write a to-do list on a

1268
01:21:27,375 --> 01:21:30,975
Speaker 1:  piece of paper, scan it and it'll pull it into the app as a

1269
01:21:30,975 --> 01:21:34,775
Speaker 1:  digital to-do list. That's ai. That's not magical Siri

1270
01:21:34,775 --> 01:21:38,615
Speaker 1:  chatbot, but it's ai. And so I think if, if Apple is

1271
01:21:38,825 --> 01:21:42,815
Speaker 1:  smart And I think Apple generally is smart, it's

1272
01:21:42,815 --> 01:21:46,455
Speaker 1:  going to do that kind of stuff more

1273
01:21:46,465 --> 01:21:50,055
Speaker 1:  going forward and to whatever extent it's gonna try to do magical god

1274
01:21:50,175 --> 01:21:53,935
Speaker 1:  chatbots, it seems like it's preparing to lean on companies like

1275
01:21:53,995 --> 01:21:57,975
Speaker 1:  OpenAI and Anthropic and even Google to do that. The idea that

1276
01:21:57,975 --> 01:22:01,535
Speaker 1:  Apple is going to internally build magical, beautiful, perfect Siri seems

1277
01:22:01,775 --> 01:22:05,215
Speaker 1:  unlikely. And I think that is where you're gonna see Apple start to pull

1278
01:22:05,215 --> 01:22:08,295
Speaker 1:  back because the idea of Apple intelligence being like the front and center

1279
01:22:08,295 --> 01:22:12,255
Speaker 1:  interface to your phone, I don't think was ever the right idea. I don't

1280
01:22:12,255 --> 01:22:16,215
Speaker 1:  think Apple knows how to do it. Apple is not doing it well so far And

1281
01:22:16,215 --> 01:22:19,415
Speaker 1:  I think you're gonna see it start to pull back on that stuff and start pushing

1282
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:23,215
Speaker 1:  on the idea that actually what AI is is like an enabling infrastructure and

1283
01:22:23,245 --> 01:22:27,135
Speaker 1:  tool set to do really cool stuff inside of your devices. That is the version

1284
01:22:27,135 --> 01:22:30,815
Speaker 1:  of AI that I am much more excited about anyway. So I think that's cool.

1285
01:22:31,395 --> 01:22:34,535
Speaker 1:  And in the meantime, there is this messy thing where Apple is going to have

1286
01:22:34,535 --> 01:22:37,895
Speaker 1:  to keep telling everybody that it's inventing God inside of your iPhone so

1287
01:22:37,895 --> 01:22:41,295
Speaker 1:  that its stock price will go up. But if you just look at those different

1288
01:22:41,295 --> 01:22:45,255
Speaker 1:  things, pushing and pulling against each other, which side wins and

1289
01:22:45,255 --> 01:22:49,215
Speaker 1:  like who is drinking which Kool-Aid and huffing, which farts is like

1290
01:22:49,995 --> 01:22:53,295
Speaker 1:  the story in AI right now because there is, there is what you have to say

1291
01:22:53,315 --> 01:22:57,095
Speaker 1:  out loud. There is what is possible, there is what is useful and there is

1292
01:22:57,095 --> 01:23:00,535
Speaker 1:  what is interesting and those are not all the same thing right now. So that's,

1293
01:23:00,535 --> 01:23:04,455
Speaker 1:  that's my big take on just how I'm thinking about what Apple and all

1294
01:23:04,455 --> 01:23:08,165
Speaker 1:  of these other companies are up to are, are we building God or are we building

1295
01:23:08,165 --> 01:23:11,885
Speaker 1:  better software? I'm, I am deeply suspicious of one of those things and really,

1296
01:23:11,885 --> 01:23:15,365
Speaker 1:  really excited about the other And I think Apple is starting to lean toward

1297
01:23:15,385 --> 01:23:18,765
Speaker 1:  the side that makes me happy. Anyway, Nathan, I hope any of that makes any

1298
01:23:18,765 --> 01:23:22,245
Speaker 1:  sense. If you have theories about what Apple is up to with AI or if you've

1299
01:23:22,245 --> 01:23:26,125
Speaker 1:  seen cool ways in which it's actually giving developers tools or even

1300
01:23:26,125 --> 01:23:29,365
Speaker 1:  implementing some of this AI stuff itself, send them my way. All this new

1301
01:23:29,565 --> 01:23:32,645
Speaker 1:  software is packed with this stuff and I'm, I'm super curious to see how

1302
01:23:32,645 --> 01:23:36,165
Speaker 1:  people are using it in interesting ways. So hit me up. 8, 6 6 VERGE one,
