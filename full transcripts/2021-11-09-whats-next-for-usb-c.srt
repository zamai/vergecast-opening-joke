Description: The Verge's Dieter Bohn dedicates this week's Tuesday episode to the fractious history and fraught future of USB-C.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,930
Speaker 2:  Here at the verge. One of our hardest weeks every year comes in

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,800
Speaker 2:  January, it's CES, the consumer electronic

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,730
Speaker 2:  show. And it's such an intense tech conference that we spend just

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,720
Speaker 2:  a ridiculous amount of time planning out what gear we're going to

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,440
Speaker 2:  bring. It's vital that we have tools that we can

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,430
Speaker 2:  rely on our cameras, our phones, and our laptops. They all have

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,150
Speaker 2:  to work. And if there's any way we can make the stuff that we stuff into

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,960
Speaker 2:  our bags simpler, or more importantly, way less, we're going to

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,710
Speaker 2:  take it. So in 2016, I was

11
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,490
Speaker 2:  very excited to have a tiny 12 inch Mac book and

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,940
Speaker 2:  a Google nexus, six P the laptop weighed next to

13
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,840
Speaker 2:  nothing. And the phone had a massive screen,

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,140
Speaker 2:  both my phone and my laptop charged with the exact same

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,050
Speaker 2:  cable, which was perfect. I was super ready for

16
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,680
Speaker 2:  CES until suddenly in the middle of that

17
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,490
Speaker 2:  hectic week, the single solitary USBC port

18
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,420
Speaker 2:  on the Mac book stopped working. I couldn't plug my

19
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,380
Speaker 2:  camera in, I couldn't sync files. I could barely get the laptop to

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,250
Speaker 2:  charge. And it was all because of a faulty cable.

21
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,150
Speaker 2:  My next six P did what it was designed to do what I plugged into the Mac

22
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,990
Speaker 2:  book. It asked for all the power that it could get to fast charge.

23
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,470
Speaker 2:  And so then the cable provided it and that ended up frying the

24
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,430
Speaker 2:  laptop's USB controller. When USBC first

25
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,090
Speaker 2:  started, the only way to know for sure that you were buying a safe and

26
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,450
Speaker 2:  reliable cable was to follow a Google

27
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,260
Speaker 2:  plus group and hope that you could come across the reviews of

28
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,130
Speaker 2:  a single Google engineer who was running tests on

29
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,090
Speaker 2:  everything that was available. According to the USB implementers

30
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,050
Speaker 2:  forum, the official group that defines USB, there were only

31
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,590
Speaker 2:  61 certified USBC cables. At the

32
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,460
Speaker 2:  time, the rest were just unlabeled junk. It was

33
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,360
Speaker 2:  like playing Russian roulette with your laptop.

34
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,750
Speaker 2:  It's five years later now, and you're not likely to fry your computer with

35
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,620
Speaker 2:  a cable, but USB-C is still complicated. We

36
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,220
Speaker 2:  have one plug that now does multiple things from low power

37
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,120
Speaker 2:  charging and slow data to ridiculously high, 240

38
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,110
Speaker 2:  watt power. You can also get super high speed data. There's Thunderbolt,

39
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,040
Speaker 2:  there's monitors, there's audio. The dream of a single cable and

40
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,380
Speaker 2:  plug is great, but it's also a little

41
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,070
Speaker 2:  confusing. I'm Dieter Bohn, the executive editor of the verge.

42
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,580
Speaker 2:  And I'm really excited to talk through what's going on today with

43
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,510
Speaker 2:  USB-C we're doing a special run of more focused Vergecast

44
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,290
Speaker 2:  episodes on Tuesdays. And this week, as you can obviously tell it's

45
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,850
Speaker 2:  time to really talk about

46
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:54,840
Speaker 2:  USB-C.

47
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,780
Speaker 2:  So before we get into the variety of complications that USB-C created,

48
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,380
Speaker 2:  let's talk about what it actually is because there's even some confusion

49
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,070
Speaker 2:  right there. Let's just get down to the very,

50
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,790
Speaker 2:  very basics. USB-C is a 24 pin

51
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,630
Speaker 2:  universal serial bus connector system, universal because it works

52
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,260
Speaker 2:  with everything in theory cereal, because that's the technical term for

53
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,980
Speaker 2:  communication and computers for this kind of port and bus, which is short

54
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,850
Speaker 2:  for omnibus switches, a kind of transport. It's another computer

55
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,240
Speaker 2:  term for communication. Anyway, one of USB C's big

56
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,170
Speaker 2:  innovations is that it has a rotationally symmetrical connector, which

57
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,290
Speaker 2:  means that you can plug it in upside down or right side up. You don't get

58
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,680
Speaker 2:  it wrong every time you try to plug it in, like you do with older flavors

59
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,400
Speaker 2:  of USB, like USPA or micro USB USBC was

60
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,270
Speaker 2:  designed to replace data transfer connectors like USBA, and also offer

61
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,960
Speaker 2:  faster speeds, which these days could be as fast as 40 gigabits per

62
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,830
Speaker 2:  second. USB-C is also meant to provide power to replace your

63
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,820
Speaker 2:  power cable. The name for the main standard is USB PD or

64
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,480
Speaker 2:  USB power delivery, which is a much higher power delivery

65
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,440
Speaker 2:  standard than past USB connectors. It can range from standard phone wattage

66
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,370
Speaker 2:  like five or 20 or 30 Watts up to a hundred Watts for laptops, or now

67
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,120
Speaker 2:  with the newest versions, 240 Watts. This standard

68
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,690
Speaker 2:  allows the cable to power devices like gaming laptops and smart speakers.

69
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,230
Speaker 2:  You're in a Tendo switch, headphones, whatever, and communicate the

70
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:48,010
Speaker 2:  appropriate amount of wattage and the current levels that are being

71
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,880
Speaker 2:  delivered to the device. USBC cables also have the

72
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,300
Speaker 2:  ability to transfer both video and audio signals, replacing cables like

73
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,880
Speaker 2:  HTMI or the old 3.5 TRS headphone

74
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,570
Speaker 2:  Jack. It can also send video signals for monitors, like say over display

75
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,470
Speaker 2:  port, add all that up. And the dream is really simple, a

76
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,040
Speaker 2:  single cable and plug that does anything and

77
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,820
Speaker 2:  everything. You don't need multiple different cables. You can get everything

78
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,150
Speaker 2:  you need onto your laptop or your phone with just a single

79
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:21,140
Speaker 2:  one. Okay. So that all sounds simple enough, right? Transfers

80
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,950
Speaker 2:  data transfers. Power can be used for video or audio, but the

81
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,940
Speaker 2:  problems pop up pretty quickly. We're used to the shape of the

82
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,840
Speaker 2:  cable telling us what the cable does. Only your power cable fits

83
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,590
Speaker 2:  into the power plug or the HTMI fits into the HTMI. But with

84
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:40,400
Speaker 2:  USB-C the physical shape, doesn't tell you what the thing does

85
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,970
Speaker 2:  anymore. And it turns out not every USB-C cable can actually

86
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,790
Speaker 2:  support doing everything that you might want it to.

87
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,780
Speaker 3:  The issue, I guess, is that the physical plug, the USBC plug

88
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,680
Speaker 3:  is the same, regardless of whether it just carries power or power and

89
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,640
Speaker 3:  low speed data or power and high-speed data or power and high-speed data.

90
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,140
Speaker 3:  And high-speed video

91
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,620
Speaker 2:  Rod would be he's the CTO of a company called a S C the

92
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,140
Speaker 2:  Australian semiconductor technology company.

93
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,920
Speaker 3:  So I've been involved with USB-C and USB PD, I guess for eight years

94
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,500
Speaker 3:  now worked with a number of Silicon vendors, a number of

95
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,480
Speaker 3:  OEMs, and I've attended a number of USB drop

96
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,470
Speaker 3:  building workshops during the early days of USB-C when everyone was just

97
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,380
Speaker 3:  working out how things worked with each other, or didn't work with each other

98
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,000
Speaker 3:  as the case may be. So

99
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,420
Speaker 2:  It's a bit about the intricacies of the standard and where the confusion

100
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,260
Speaker 2:  comes from

101
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,920
Speaker 3:  When you start to have a single cable for all those different things, power,

102
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,400
Speaker 3:  video, and data. Then clearly, if you want to

103
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,330
Speaker 3:  have cheap cables, they're going to be different cables that

104
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,260
Speaker 3:  just carry power and nothing else versus cables that can carry four to

105
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,780
Speaker 3:  gigabits per second of video and dark.

106
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,770
Speaker 2:  Since there are different types of USB-C cables being made, you

107
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,280
Speaker 2:  may own a cable that charges your phone, but doesn't really support anything

108
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,120
Speaker 2:  else. You may own another USB-C cable that charges your

109
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,360
Speaker 2:  phone faster. And then another that's only able to transfer data

110
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,230
Speaker 2:  and they all look the same at the heart of it. The

111
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:10,010
Speaker 2:  universal USBC connector, which is designed to simplify things, created a

112
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,550
Speaker 2:  problem of cheap cables that don't do what you want and confusing tech

113
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,330
Speaker 2:  standards USB-C is on the way to making tech faster and

114
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,230
Speaker 2:  smarter. Don't get me wrong. But right now my cable drawer is still as

115
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:25,220
Speaker 2:  messy as it's always been. Now. Technically there is a

116
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,400
Speaker 2:  process for clarifying all of these different cables, as you could probably

117
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,120
Speaker 2:  guess, it's by labeling them on the packaging or ideally

118
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,750
Speaker 2:  on the cable itself, but there's a problem there too. There's

119
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,230
Speaker 2:  weird naming conventions and different branding from different manufacturers.

120
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,590
Speaker 2:  So it's not easy enough to know whether or not you've bought the right

121
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,760
Speaker 2:  cable. There is

122
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,360
Speaker 3:  Branding that's meant to be put on the plug to tell you what's what, but

123
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,960
Speaker 3:  of course, you know, some manufacturers put their own logo on instead of

124
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,830
Speaker 3:  the branding. And so that doesn't help with people. And then on the side

125
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:58,410
Speaker 3:  of laptop, you know, there's limited space there to write what that

126
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,040
Speaker 3:  receptive go on the laptop can handle. I guess it's a combination of

127
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,160
Speaker 3:  humans making assumptions about what things can do, which are reasonable

128
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,070
Speaker 3:  assumptions to make, you know, if it plugs in, you expect it to work. But

129
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,610
Speaker 3:  of course all the cables look the same unless you know what the logo

130
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,150
Speaker 3:  means. It's rifle confusion.

131
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:19,110
Speaker 2:  All right, let's talk about the logos because the USB implementers

132
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:23,070
Speaker 2:  forum, which is the organization that maintains the USB standard and its

133
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,760
Speaker 2:  specifications are really great at keeping a clear message for

134
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,660
Speaker 2:  consumers on what the cables they buy can actually do. But my colleague

135
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,470
Speaker 2:  at the verge Haim Gardberg is great at deciphering and explaining what

136
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,340
Speaker 2:  all of these USB specs are and what the logos mean and what they're

137
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,250
Speaker 2:  used for. So let's bring them in to talk. I'm

138
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,020
Speaker 2:  Gartenberg you are senior reporter at the verge. Also the

139
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,800
Speaker 2:  only person I personally know who is more obsessed with USBC than I am

140
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,730
Speaker 2:  welcome,

141
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,470
Speaker 4:  Good to be here. So

142
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,460
Speaker 2:  We have talked a bit about the USB spec and how it

143
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,390
Speaker 2:  works, but fundamentally, what we're really talking about here is lots of

144
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,350
Speaker 2:  cables that theoretically can do different things, even though they look

145
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,040
Speaker 2:  the same. So what kind of specs can actually be

146
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,740
Speaker 2:  labeled on a USB-C cable?

147
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,160
Speaker 4:  So broadly speaking, there's two types of things that

148
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,090
Speaker 4:  USB C cable can do. There is data and there

149
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:22,050
Speaker 4:  is charging. Now most cables do both, but

150
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,890
Speaker 4:  up until USB four, which is new, you didn't have

151
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,880
Speaker 4:  to actually do either of these things. You could make a charging cable

152
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,600
Speaker 4:  that didn't do data. You could do a data cable that, you know, didn't meet

153
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,170
Speaker 4:  certain charging specs. So USBC describes the

154
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,560
Speaker 4:  port, but there's a lot of things you can do with it,

155
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,460
Speaker 2:  Right? So let's stick with power to start. So what are the different labels?

156
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,000
Speaker 2:  We should look for the different types of power that USBC can

157
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,960
Speaker 2:  do. So

158
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,890
Speaker 4:  When USBC first started, there were a lot of different specs. There are

159
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,980
Speaker 4:  still a lot of weird, different, little proprietary, fast charging

160
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,610
Speaker 4:  specs. There are bigger, fast charging things, but the most important one

161
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,120
Speaker 4:  and the one that's become the main one that virtually everyone uses in some

162
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,960
Speaker 4:  capacity is USB power delivery or USB PD. Now

163
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,710
Speaker 4:  there are several versions of that. Newest is USB PD,

164
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:14,610
Speaker 4:  three.one, which was announced in may. They started rolling out new logos,

165
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:18,570
Speaker 4:  new documentation for it in September. And there are actually products shipping

166
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:22,350
Speaker 4:  with it today. The new MacBook pros that apple just released

167
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,280
Speaker 4:  do use USB PD, three.one for the mag safe ports, not the

168
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,350
Speaker 4:  regular ports, just the max eight ports.

169
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,190
Speaker 2:  Sure. And what is USB PD? three.one, get us

170
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,970
Speaker 4:  <inaudible> gets you all the benefits of USB PD,

171
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,840
Speaker 4:  which is the different tiers of charging. It is designed

172
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,800
Speaker 4:  that the two devices can kind of handshake and go, I need 10 Watts

173
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,790
Speaker 4:  and your charger will go, okay. I can give you 10 Watts. So it does all that,

174
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,660
Speaker 4:  but it ups the wattage considerably. So USB

175
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,060
Speaker 4:  PD three a which the one that came before this was up to a hundred

176
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,600
Speaker 4:  Watts and was sort of the bottleneck for adding

177
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,870
Speaker 4:  USBC to laptops, higher powered laptops for

178
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,320
Speaker 4:  charging, because the most of you got, if it was a hundred Watts, the bigger

179
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,250
Speaker 4:  laptops you have apples old 16 inch literally was a 97

180
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,000
Speaker 4:  watt USBC charger, but you can go pass that. So this

181
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,780
Speaker 4:  goes all the way up to two 40, assuming you have a device cable on a

182
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,460
Speaker 4:  brick, that can go that

183
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,240
Speaker 2:  Right. And so I looking for USB PD,

184
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,110
Speaker 2:  three.one on the box or the cable. Am I looking for like a

185
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:30,040
Speaker 2:  color code? How do I know that my device,

186
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,790
Speaker 2:  my cable and my brick are all capable of getting to

187
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,920
Speaker 2:  40 Watts through that entire chain,

188
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,980
Speaker 4:  The USB implementers forum, which is the group that comes up with all these

189
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,920
Speaker 4:  standards is not the best at naming and not the best at

190
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,520
Speaker 4:  branding. They are trying a different tack with this

191
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,240
Speaker 4:  generation of stuff, which is, they now have bespoke

192
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,200
Speaker 4:  logos that are supposed to appear on certified PD, three.one

193
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,040
Speaker 4:  devices, and also certified USB four devices, which is not the same thing

194
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,640
Speaker 4:  as PD three.one, which we'll get to in a minute. And it's

195
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,630
Speaker 4:  literally either a two 40 watt. It'll be like a little sticker on your

196
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:08,560
Speaker 4:  thing that this is a cable that is capable of going up to two 40. It's

197
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,100
Speaker 4:  like a little USB. It has a thing. You can see it on our site. And they also

198
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,970
Speaker 4:  have one for up to 60 Watts. So you'll know this is either,

199
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,750
Speaker 4:  you know, a quote unquote, low power cable that's designed to

200
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,380
Speaker 4:  charge, you know, lower power things. Or this is a high powered cable that

201
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,280
Speaker 4:  can charge your theoretical, you know, 240 watt gaming laptop.

202
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,000
Speaker 2:  And for me like the big thing with USB PD, and this was a

203
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,750
Speaker 2:  problem early, early on with USB-C is there, like you mentioned that

204
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,590
Speaker 2:  proprietary charging Samsung Qualcomm had one that was super weird. A bunch

205
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:42,520
Speaker 2:  of Android phones were using wackadoo fast charging systems and

206
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,330
Speaker 2:  not using standard USB PD, but by and large, it

207
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,600
Speaker 2:  seems like we are at a place where most stuff is using the non-proprietary

208
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,350
Speaker 2:  standards-based USB power delivery system. And it's just a matter of

209
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,280
Speaker 2:  making sure that you look for the correct label on the box to

210
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,850
Speaker 2:  make sure that your cable is capable of providing the power that your device

211
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,600
Speaker 2:  is asking for. Exactly. Okay. So power could be

212
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,590
Speaker 2:  worse, but it's, it's definitely like, okay,

213
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,980
Speaker 2:  for the most part, as long as you're keeping an eye on things, what about

214
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,880
Speaker 2:  data? Because we also have new standards for transferring data.

215
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,570
Speaker 4:  So data is where things get a little complicated

216
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:23,080
Speaker 4:  because just because you have USB-C cable does not

217
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,740
Speaker 4:  necessarily mean you're using the USB data

218
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,550
Speaker 4:  transfer spec. And even if you are using the USB data transfer

219
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,420
Speaker 4:  spec, it doesn't guarantee that you're using any particular version

220
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,080
Speaker 4:  except for us before, which in part was largely designed to fix a lot of

221
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,860
Speaker 4:  these issues. There are many different USB

222
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,190
Speaker 4:  specs. There are many different names. They have gone through various attempts

223
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:48,970
Speaker 4:  to rebrand them. So we have all the way going through you have

224
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,940
Speaker 4:  USB three.one gen one, USB three.one, J two USB three.one,

225
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,660
Speaker 4:  two den, one USB through to two gen two USB, three dot two gen one by

226
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,080
Speaker 4:  two used to be three to dot three dot two gen two by

227
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,040
Speaker 4:  two a and USB four. Wonderful part of this is

228
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,490
Speaker 4:  not as bad as it sounds because a lot of it is whenever they come up with

229
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,760
Speaker 4:  a new standard. So when we have, you know, USB three,

230
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,720
Speaker 4:  two USB three, one gen one gets renamed to USB

231
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,290
Speaker 4:  three to gen one, and same with gen one by two and gen two by

232
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:22,130
Speaker 4:  two. A lot of this is just backporting because the new

233
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,820
Speaker 4:  standard has to include all the previous standards so that if I get a

234
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,630
Speaker 4:  USB three dot two gen two by two supporting cable, and I

235
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:33,530
Speaker 4:  plug it into, you know, my old headphones or, or my old computer that only

236
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,890
Speaker 4:  supports the lower data transfer speed, everything still needs to work.

237
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,410
Speaker 2:  And to a certain extent, you know, we're running through all the different

238
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:43,040
Speaker 2:  names of all the specs over the years, but this is a probably

239
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,730
Speaker 2:  actually kind of want to have, I mean, you want to have clear branding for

240
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,510
Speaker 2:  sure, but you want your cables to get faster over time.

241
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,310
Speaker 2:  Right? You want it, you want this to,

242
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,180
Speaker 4:  Yes. The perfect opposite example is lightning, which is the same cable,

243
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,140
Speaker 4:  the same port, and hasn't updated its data transfer speed, and, you

244
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:04,040
Speaker 4:  know, half a decade at least, and transfers much, much, much slower

245
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,000
Speaker 4:  than USBC does. Right. So this is a good kind of problem. It

246
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,750
Speaker 4:  does lead to some confusion. And that in part is sort of what USB

247
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,270
Speaker 4:  four is sort of trying to solve.

248
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,750
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So why don't you talk about USB for what it's trying to solve and what's

249
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,130
Speaker 2:  good and maybe bad about it.

250
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:22,910
Speaker 4:  Okay. So you asked before is the newest USB spec. And it does a

251
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,300
Speaker 4:  couple things differently than like the four versions of

252
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,690
Speaker 4:  USB three dot two that existed before, which

253
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,440
Speaker 4:  is, it is technically a super set of USB three dot

254
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,280
Speaker 4:  two and Thunderbolt three, which went open source in 2017. So it was

255
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,270
Speaker 4:  previously Intel's own standard. Now it's open source.

256
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:45,170
Speaker 4:  And a lot of that is what the foundation of USB four is. Okay. A

257
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,560
Speaker 4:  couple of things that make you as before different is you're no longer allowed

258
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,400
Speaker 4:  to make USB type a cables or USB BB cables. If it is

259
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,330
Speaker 4:  us before it has to be USBC. Got it. Second, if you

260
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:00,140
Speaker 4:  are doing charging, the charging has to support PD. Got it.

261
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,650
Speaker 4:  So in theory, if you buy USB for cable, you know, that it will

262
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,860
Speaker 4:  have certain minimums for charging and certain minimums or data

263
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,670
Speaker 4:  transfer, and those will be consistent across anything that is

264
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,760
Speaker 4:  USB four compatible. Got it, which is good,

265
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,510
Speaker 4:  except it's not perfect. Because when we

266
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:21,470
Speaker 4:  mentioned before that, you don't have to do both at the same time, so

267
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:25,040
Speaker 4:  you don't have to do everything. So there's two different levels of USB

268
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,940
Speaker 4:  for data transfer a USB for, it goes all the way up

269
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,180
Speaker 4:  to 40 gigabits per second, but there are actually two

270
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:36,080
Speaker 4:  substandards there's USB for 20 gigabits per second, which as the name implies

271
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,800
Speaker 4:  only goes up to 20 gigabits per second. And then there's USB for

272
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,550
Speaker 4:  40 gigabits per second, which goes all the way to 40 gigabytes per second.

273
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:47,030
Speaker 4:  And there are also separate logos for those two things. So in

274
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,310
Speaker 4:  theory, when you're looking at a USB for cable or

275
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,340
Speaker 4:  charger, well USB for cable, for data transfer, you're going to look at the

276
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,210
Speaker 4:  cable and it'll say on the box, you'll look for 20 or 40. And you'll have

277
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,930
Speaker 4:  an idea of whether you have the slower or faster cable and then

278
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,620
Speaker 4:  60 or two 40, which will give you an idea of whether you have the

279
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,300
Speaker 4:  slower, faster charging.

280
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,330
Speaker 2:  And part of the thinking here, isn't just, oh, let's confuse people. It's

281
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,900
Speaker 2:  that like making a full USB for 40

282
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,680
Speaker 2:  gigabit, two 40 watt cable. It's just, it costs

283
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,950
Speaker 2:  more, right? And so you could theoretically go buy something that only does

284
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,040
Speaker 2:  20, cause you don't need the 40 cause that's a lot. Or you could buy something

285
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,860
Speaker 2:  that doesn't support all the way up to two 40. You only need a hundred or

286
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,790
Speaker 2:  15 or whatever, because you can save a ton of money buying

287
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,720
Speaker 2:  a full spec top of the line, USB for cable supports

288
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,200
Speaker 2:  everything. It's like buying an old Thunderbolt three cable it's, you know,

289
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,620
Speaker 2:  there's limits on its length. And it's also costs a lot of money, right?

290
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,490
Speaker 4:  Yes. Before also does fix a couple of the other problems with the older USBC

291
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:48,210
Speaker 4:  standards because it is built on Thunderbolt three. So USB four by

292
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,080
Speaker 4:  default will support things like audio and display port, which you did

293
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,920
Speaker 4:  not necessarily have to bundle in before on USB three.

294
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,910
Speaker 4:  But it's also a slow rollout. Like to my knowledge, there are no two

295
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,630
Speaker 4:  40 watt USB four cables that you can just buy today. Except

296
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:07,200
Speaker 2:  Technically, I guess you could say maybe the mag safe, although it's not

297
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,390
Speaker 2:  for a gigabyte MagSafe has just power

298
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:13,200
Speaker 4:  By two MagSafe cables and cut the ends off and splice them

299
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,130
Speaker 4:  together. You might have one, but please, actually,

300
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,970
Speaker 4:  please do. If you spend $160 on this and on this med science

301
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,790
Speaker 4:  experiment and you don't electrocute yourself, let me know if it works.

302
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,820
Speaker 2:  Yeah, please, please be safe. We don't recommend trying this at home, but

303
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,570
Speaker 2:  if you wanted to, so you briefly mentioned display part alt mode and audio.

304
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,530
Speaker 2:  So there's like standard data transfer, but USB C cables have also been used

305
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:38,430
Speaker 2:  just for straight audio or for straight providing display via the display

306
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:42,390
Speaker 2:  port standard that was not necessarily included before. But part of

307
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,510
Speaker 2:  the point of view as before is that all gets, that all has to be part of

308
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,050
Speaker 2:  the spec now. Exactly.

309
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,770
Speaker 4:  That's sort of a trickle down effect from thunderbolts, right? Because you

310
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,370
Speaker 4:  have all these alt modes and these optional protocols that you can build

311
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,060
Speaker 4:  in that you don't need to necessarily, or you didn't need to. If

312
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,510
Speaker 4:  the logic sort of was, if I was building a pair of headphones or a battery

313
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:04,320
Speaker 4:  pack, the battery pack doesn't need data transfer. Right. For the most part,

314
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,170
Speaker 4:  there are one or two battery packs that have firmware that you can update.

315
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:10,830
Speaker 4:  But for the most part, most battery packs don't need data. Yeah. My battery

316
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,750
Speaker 4:  pack doesn't need a headphone Jack. Right.

317
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,530
Speaker 2:  Right. Okay. So you roll up to amazon.com or best buy or Walmart or

318
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,520
Speaker 2:  whatever. And you see there's a USB 3.2 cable and USB for cable.

319
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,280
Speaker 2:  Is it, is it reasonable that you might just want to spend less money and

320
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,520
Speaker 2:  get the 3.2 cable? Is it, is that a totally normal thing to do? Or should

321
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,090
Speaker 2:  everybody be thinking, oh, I only want to buy USB for, from now on if possible.

322
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:33,870
Speaker 4:  I mean, as someone who likes to future proof their stuff, I always try and

323
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,200
Speaker 4:  buy the most, which is funny because now all my a hundred watt cables are

324
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,590
Speaker 4:  going to be worthless. If I ever get a device that needs more than that.

325
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,440
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I mean, it depends a lot on what you're using it for. If you're looking

326
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,920
Speaker 4:  for, you know, a one, a one job fits all cable to hook your computer up to

327
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,710
Speaker 4:  your monitor, that'll do, you know, audio and the whole USB hub, this built

328
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,430
Speaker 4:  into your monitor and display port and charging and everything, make sure

329
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:58,360
Speaker 4:  that you're getting the cable that you need for that. And it can

330
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,330
Speaker 4:  be easier just to get a USB for cable. Cause you're pretty much guaranteed

331
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:05,020
Speaker 4:  that that will work, right. If you want to avoid the hassle, that's probably

332
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,980
Speaker 4:  your best solution. If you know what you're doing, if you just need something

333
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,070
Speaker 4:  to charge your cell phone at night, you know, we just want a long cable to

334
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,470
Speaker 4:  stretch across the living room to, you know, charge your phone while you're

335
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:18,400
Speaker 4:  watching Netflix. You're probably good with anything so long as it, you know,

336
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,940
Speaker 4:  supports PD and the thing to really keep an eye on. And this is the thing

337
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,630
Speaker 4:  that, you know, you'll see on sellers on Amazon and in stores, look at what

338
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,410
Speaker 4:  the wattage that it supports is because not all PD cables support a hundred

339
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:33,370
Speaker 4:  Watts, even some are 30 Watts. Some are 60 Watts. I have personally run

340
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:36,700
Speaker 4:  into when I've been charging with cables and realized like my laptop wasn't

341
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,580
Speaker 4:  charging. Cause it was only a 30 watt cable cause it was really old.

342
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,240
Speaker 2:  Right? So this all sounds great. We've landed at USB four is the one that

343
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,210
Speaker 2:  you can safely buy, but you brought up Thunderbolt a couple of

344
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,750
Speaker 2:  times and now Thunderbolt is Intel standard and it

345
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,680
Speaker 2:  has, it's using the same USB-C plug at least with Thunderbolt three,

346
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,640
Speaker 2:  they opened source Thunderbolt three. So that's now part of USB four,

347
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,730
Speaker 2:  but there's a new version of Thunderbolt. Can you tell me a little bit about

348
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:01,600
Speaker 2:  that?

349
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,350
Speaker 4:  So that's thunderbolts for, and the difference between Thunderbolt

350
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:09,100
Speaker 4:  for, in us before is thunderbolts is proprietary to

351
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,790
Speaker 4:  Intel. Not that other device and other manufacturers can't use it. They show

352
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,730
Speaker 4:  up on devices all the time. Again, Apple's new MacBook pros are Thunderbolt

353
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:19,600
Speaker 4:  for ports, but if you want to make a thunderbolts for device or a

354
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,590
Speaker 4:  cable, you need to go to Intel and Intel has to approve it and test

355
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:27,160
Speaker 4:  it and make sure that everything works. And thunderbolts is

356
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:31,030
Speaker 4:  sort of the idea that the USB for standard was

357
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:34,960
Speaker 4:  sort of promising before, which is that it's just

358
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,990
Speaker 4:  one cable. You don't need to worry about what you're getting or what you're

359
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:41,860
Speaker 4:  doing or anything. If it has the thunderbolts and a four on it, you can plug

360
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,670
Speaker 4:  it into your Thunderbolt thing with four on it and you will be guaranteed.

361
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:49,420
Speaker 4:  It'll support, you know, the 40 gigabits right off the bat, it'll support

362
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,080
Speaker 4:  the multiple displays, it'll support, you know, PCA data transfer speeds

363
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,800
Speaker 4:  up to a certain thing. It'll work with thunderbolts for docs socially, you

364
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,790
Speaker 4:  have more ports. The flip side is that Thunderbolt for cables and Thunderbolt

365
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:04,270
Speaker 4:  for accessories are really expensive. So

366
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:08,260
Speaker 4:  it's sort of your one shot fits all thing except you you're paying for that

367
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:12,130
Speaker 4:  privilege. Right? The other weird quirk is thunderbolts four was built

368
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:15,850
Speaker 4:  on the original batch of USPS before.

369
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:19,750
Speaker 4:  So it's cross compatible with that in a lot of ways. So it supports, you

370
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,120
Speaker 4:  know, the USB for 40 gigabit per second data transfer rate, which is the

371
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,010
Speaker 4:  Thunderbolt three one, but used before has a weird quirk actually where

372
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:30,700
Speaker 4:  it is slightly better in theory, in charging than

373
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,510
Speaker 4:  thunderbolts because Thunderbolt right now only does a hundred watt

374
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,960
Speaker 4:  charging because it has the old PD spec because Thunderbolt

375
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,740
Speaker 4:  four came out in July, 2020, a

376
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,410
Speaker 4:  full year before the USP actually introduced

377
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:49,040
Speaker 4:  three.one with this two 40 spec goddess. So if you are

378
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,980
Speaker 4:  buying a new and at this point,

379
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,490
Speaker 4:  non-existent, if you're buying, you know, a laptop somewhere in the

380
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:59,480
Speaker 4:  future and it charges it to 40 Watts, or right now we Thunderbolt for

381
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,570
Speaker 4:  cable, theoretically does not charge that, which is actually a quirk. You

382
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:06,140
Speaker 4:  can see just to bring it up again. Cause it's the only device that's even

383
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,130
Speaker 4:  a little bit using three.one PD, three.one, right on the 16 inch Mac

384
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:13,760
Speaker 4:  book. The reason that you can only fast charge the 16 inch Mac book through

385
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,120
Speaker 4:  that mag safe port is because that's the only one that uses

386
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,080
Speaker 4:  USB PD, three.one, the other three are Thunderbolt ports. And those

387
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,530
Speaker 4:  can still only charge at a hundred Watts, which isn't the full one 40 that,

388
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,020
Speaker 4:  that 16 inch laptop needs to fast charge. Right?

389
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,980
Speaker 2:  So in theory, we could say that that MagSafe port is a USB

390
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,880
Speaker 2:  for port, but it's not USBC. It's not really even USB cause it's just power.

391
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,930
Speaker 2:  It's a sort of a,

392
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,500
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So the max safe port doesn't do data like you can't plug your Mac safe

393
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,160
Speaker 4:  cable into a USB C hard drive. And that's the perfect

394
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,850
Speaker 4:  example of how you can use PD as a spec without necessarily

395
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,030
Speaker 4:  using the USB for transfer and everything. Okay.

396
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,780
Speaker 2:  Okay. Lightning round lightning round. If I have a Thunderbolt for

397
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,770
Speaker 2:  cable, does it support everything that USB four does?

398
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,710
Speaker 4:  Yes. Except for the 240 watt charging. Got it.

399
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:04,190
Speaker 2:  If I have a USB for cable, does it support everything? Thunderbolt

400
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,870
Speaker 2:  three does.

401
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,810
Speaker 4:  Yes, but they are not entirely cross

402
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:12,290
Speaker 4:  compatible. All Thunderbolt three stuff should work with us

403
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:16,130
Speaker 4:  before, but it's not necessarily backwards compatible because Thunderbolt

404
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:19,520
Speaker 4:  three came first. So like if you have an older hub, it might not necessarily

405
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,970
Speaker 4:  play well, unless it's been updated, et cetera. Got it.

406
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:26,870
Speaker 2:  If I see a USB-C cable sitting on my desk, what can I

407
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:29,390
Speaker 2:  trust that it will do

408
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:32,660
Speaker 4:  No label audit? You can't trust that it will do anything in

409
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:36,290
Speaker 4:  theory. It is probably a good bet that it will do data

410
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:40,280
Speaker 4:  transfer at at least five gigabits per second. And that it will charge at,

411
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,210
Speaker 4:  you know, at least five Watts, which is the minimum data

412
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,660
Speaker 4:  transfer rate of USB three.one gen one, which is

413
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,930
Speaker 4:  the slowest and worst USB-C cable that

414
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:54,350
Speaker 4:  exists anything past that. There's no real way to know,

415
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,890
Speaker 4:  unless it physically says on the cable has, you know, the

416
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,880
Speaker 4:  USPI branding that they've been encouraging people to use or some other

417
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,980
Speaker 4:  markings, you know, on the physical cable itself.

418
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,670
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Which nobody's doing, I've never seen this mark on, on the cable itself

419
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,890
Speaker 2:  in my life, except maybe I'll say like the thunderbolts

420
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:12,950
Speaker 4:  I'll occasionally see the, the display port one. Like I have a cable on my

421
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,760
Speaker 4:  desk that has a display port one. There is in theory, like a USB

422
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,600
Speaker 4:  for 20 and 41. Like I have a nice picture of it from USB I

423
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,260
Speaker 4:  F of what it could look like on a cable, but I've never seen it in person,

424
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:27,620
Speaker 4:  but I also haven't seen it two 40 watt cable yet. So maybe, maybe that's

425
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,430
Speaker 4:  a new

426
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,760
Speaker 2:  Final lightening round question. Are you happier with this

427
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,750
Speaker 2:  system than with having every single cable does something different?

428
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,810
Speaker 2:  It has a different port and looks different and you don't know if it, you

429
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:42,020
Speaker 2:  know, you plugged it in the wrong way and whatever are you, do you think

430
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,450
Speaker 2:  we're better off with this USBC plug and these like

431
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:48,600
Speaker 2:  progressing standards on top of this same cable year after year?

432
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,870
Speaker 4:  I actually do think we're better off because at the end of the day, a lot

433
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:55,530
Speaker 4:  of this does suck and is really confusing, but

434
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,230
Speaker 2:  I think we're better off. Cause a lot of this sucks. It was really confusing.

435
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,070
Speaker 2:  The verge,

436
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,910
Speaker 4:  I have a BA I have like a good, a good second half of the sentence. All right.

437
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:06,870
Speaker 4:  If you are willing to, you know, play not entirely play by the rules and

438
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:09,870
Speaker 4:  play to the higher end and always assume the worst out of

439
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:13,830
Speaker 4:  USB-C. If you charge everything with an a hundred watt

440
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:17,790
Speaker 4:  PD charger, then I know that I can confidently travel with one

441
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:21,690
Speaker 4:  brick and two cables and I can charge my laptop and my

442
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,990
Speaker 4:  headphones and my Kindle and my switch and my battery

443
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:28,950
Speaker 4:  pack. And I don't need to bring a separate charger for this

444
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:32,070
Speaker 4:  and a separate charger for that. I don't need to worry about, you know, oh,

445
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:35,970
Speaker 4:  did I bring the right USB cable? Did I bring the right thing? Everything

446
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:39,870
Speaker 4:  works. And if I need to plug this into that, I have one cable.

447
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:43,380
Speaker 4:  That'll do that. If I need to, you know, sync an ebook that I bought, I can

448
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,190
Speaker 4:  do that. So the benefits do still outweigh

449
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:51,120
Speaker 4:  the negatives, especially because, and this has

450
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,720
Speaker 4:  been true for awhile and hopefully continue to be true. Things are

451
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,290
Speaker 4:  slowly getting better, that things are getting more consolidated. When I

452
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:02,130
Speaker 4:  first bought a Nintendo switch, like I couldn't figure out how to

453
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:05,040
Speaker 4:  charge it with anything other than the charger it came in because the PD

454
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,820
Speaker 4:  standard was very new and things were out. Battery

455
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,750
Speaker 4:  packs were out. Cables were out that didn't support PD on PD chargers were

456
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:16,350
Speaker 4:  actually pretty expensive at the time. Now every charger in my house is a

457
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:19,560
Speaker 4:  PD charger and I can charge my switch with my laptop charger and vice

458
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,460
Speaker 4:  versa. So things have been getting better. It's just been a slow

459
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:27,150
Speaker 4:  March. There's a Kindle with USB-C now, like that did not exist

460
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:31,020
Speaker 4:  for a very long time. So it is a slow thing forward,

461
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:34,320
Speaker 4:  but it is better. It's just still not great.

462
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,120
Speaker 2:  And it's never going to have it on the iPhone.

463
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,920
Speaker 4:  It's never going to happen on the iPhone.

464
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,710
Speaker 2:  All right. Well, here we go. Hi. Thank you so much for coming on the verge

465
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:44,640
Speaker 2:  cast and explaining all of this to us. We will have more

466
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,910
Speaker 2:  to explain about USB-C I'm sure in the near future,

467
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,160
Speaker 4:  I look forward to arguing about it

468
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,100
Speaker 4:  then.

469
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,700
Speaker 2:  Okay. So you've actually got the right cable. You're transferring

470
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,420
Speaker 2:  data at 40 gigabits per second. You're ready to charge a 240

471
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,900
Speaker 2:  Watts. That's great. Congratulations. You bought a cable,

472
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,470
Speaker 2:  unfortunately that's still just the beginning. You

473
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:11,340
Speaker 2:  still need the right ports on your actual devices

474
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,970
Speaker 2:  and you still need a charging brick that could support all the wattage that

475
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:18,750
Speaker 2:  you want. And there are still a lot of devices that

476
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:22,590
Speaker 2:  just haven't adopted USBC at their laptops

477
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:26,430
Speaker 2:  with barrel plugs gadgets with micro USB. And of

478
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:29,790
Speaker 2:  course the iPhone still uses Apple's lightning

479
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:33,720
Speaker 2:  connector C for a lot of companies. It doesn't make

480
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,290
Speaker 2:  sense to change over to the newest tech standard for a

481
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:41,230
Speaker 2:  variety of reasons. If you have a hardware design that's been built around

482
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:45,040
Speaker 2:  like micro USB, it costs a lot of money to change that. And if you

483
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,910
Speaker 2:  don't need to redesign your product or it wouldn't necessarily benefit

484
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:52,660
Speaker 2:  from what USBC has to offer, it doesn't really make sense to

485
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,230
Speaker 2:  spend all that development money to remake your product, just to put a new

486
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:59,860
Speaker 2:  port on it. Now, rod wippy who we spoke to earlier has seen

487
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,790
Speaker 2:  USB-C from its infancy. He was there at the very start

488
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:07,780
Speaker 2:  of making new kinds of data speeds and power standards work. So I

489
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:11,770
Speaker 2:  asked him is the adoption rate for USBC, just taking

490
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,360
Speaker 2:  way too long.

491
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,140
Speaker 3:  The question I think it has taken longer than I

492
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:21,100
Speaker 3:  expected, but I'm not surprised pecan doing

493
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,610
Speaker 3:  USB C properly and supporting

494
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:28,570
Speaker 3:  these hundred Watts charging or 240 Watts charging in the future.

495
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:31,990
Speaker 3:  You need to put a chip in their fridge for a start, right, just to do a hundred

496
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:35,650
Speaker 3:  Watts instead of 60 Watts. You need to have a chip in the cable and you need

497
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:39,610
Speaker 3:  to have chips at either end that can do this negotiation

498
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:43,600
Speaker 3:  to do high-speed data. You know, the 40 gigabits per second. Well, these

499
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,080
Speaker 3:  days, even inside a new laptop, just to get from the

500
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,070
Speaker 3:  processor, which is sitting in the middle of the laptop to the ports on either

501
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:54,790
Speaker 3:  side, you need extra chips to really drive the 40 gigabit

502
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:58,480
Speaker 3:  signal. I mean, if you remember the first Mac book that came out with

503
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,410
Speaker 3:  USBC, it had USBC on one side only, right?

504
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:03,700
Speaker 3:  There's a reason for that.

505
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,130
Speaker 2:  And it wasn't that they, they hate having ports on both sides.

506
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:10,240
Speaker 3:  If you want to have bots on both sides and you need to put extra chips in

507
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,750
Speaker 3:  there to really drive the signal, the further distance to the other side,

508
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,810
Speaker 2:  That's amazing. That's like less than a foot, but still when you're going

509
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:19,360
Speaker 3:  At 40 gigabits per second, then 10 centimeters

510
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,930
Speaker 3:  matters.

511
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:26,080
Speaker 2:  So you can see that this is way more complicated than you assumed. It's not

512
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,230
Speaker 2:  just say Microsoft resisting, putting USBC on the surface. Cause they're

513
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:32,590
Speaker 2:  worried. People will get confused about whether or not they should use their

514
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:36,550
Speaker 2:  phone charger to charge their laptop. It gets down to centimeters

515
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:40,480
Speaker 2:  within the device itself. Even apple who led the charge for

516
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,470
Speaker 2:  USB-C on laptops had this problem where they didn't want to spend

517
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,740
Speaker 2:  the extra money to put extra ports all the way. On the other side of the

518
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:51,430
Speaker 2:  laptop, there are still technical limitations to this technology,

519
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:55,300
Speaker 2:  which have hindered adoption. Rod says that once you start going past two

520
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,960
Speaker 2:  meter cables, for example, you start to stretch the boundaries of the

521
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,740
Speaker 2:  technology and you start thinking about putting repeaters him to the cable,

522
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:06,280
Speaker 2:  but Hey, you know, we've got USB-C ports on both sides of the Mac book now.

523
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,150
Speaker 2:  So progress. Anyway, speaking of apple, as we mentioned

524
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:13,810
Speaker 2:  before, Mac books have fully incorporated the Thunderbolt three standard

525
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:17,710
Speaker 2:  into USB-C and newer iPads have USBC

526
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:21,460
Speaker 2:  on them. And that's great, but again, the iPhone doesn't

527
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,360
Speaker 2:  and it seems more likely that the iPhone is going to end up with no

528
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,120
Speaker 2:  ports before it ends up with a USB C

529
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,870
Speaker 2:  port, but that hasn't stopped our next

530
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:35,470
Speaker 2:  guest from adding USB-C to the iPhone

531
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,400
Speaker 2:  himself.

532
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,190
Speaker 5:  And I could see like how that could possibly be done. And I saw that nobody

533
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,760
Speaker 5:  was doing it. And so just one day I thought, well, maybe I'm the guy who's

534
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,630
Speaker 5:  going to do that.

535
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,210
Speaker 2:  We're going to take a quick break for some ads. But when we come back, I

536
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:51,050
Speaker 2:  talked to Ken PO PNL, a hardware hacker in Switzerland about how he

537
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:54,830
Speaker 2:  opened up an iPhone 10 and figured out how to replace the lightning

538
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:55,350
Speaker 2:  port with

539
00:32:55,350 --> 00:33:05,330
Speaker 2:  USB-C.

540
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:51,210
Speaker 2:  Okay, we're back with the Vergecast USBC special. I'm about to talk

541
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:54,900
Speaker 2:  to Ken PNL who cleverly built USB-C directly

542
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,890
Speaker 2:  into his iPhone. So I guess

543
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:02,400
Speaker 2:  if we could start with, can you tell me why you

544
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,330
Speaker 2:  decided to pursue this project of getting USBC

545
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:07,920
Speaker 2:  working on an iPhone?

546
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,370
Speaker 5:  I think there's a lot of reasons like the first one that's maybe the most

547
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:15,360
Speaker 5:  relatable one is that like as a consumer, you know, I

548
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,170
Speaker 5:  think it was in 2015, apple came out with like the Mac book and

549
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:23,160
Speaker 5:  they really sold it as having courage and like

550
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,030
Speaker 5:  going all in with this type Seaport that is going to be deported to the future.

551
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:30,960
Speaker 5:  And that we only have this one connector to rule them all.

552
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,710
Speaker 5:  And I was really like sold by that idea, you know? And then the

553
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:38,440
Speaker 5:  years went by and for some reason, this lightning four, it

554
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,190
Speaker 5:  just stuck around and it didn't want to go and

555
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:46,120
Speaker 5:  don't get me wrong. I am a super fan of apple. Like I like what they do,

556
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,870
Speaker 5:  but I never could be like full on into the ecosystem

557
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:53,260
Speaker 5:  because there was always this thing that was bothering me. So I always had

558
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:57,040
Speaker 5:  like an Android phone and after a while, like I started

559
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,030
Speaker 5:  to gain more skills and I could see like how that could possibly

560
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:04,670
Speaker 5:  be done. And I saw that nobody was doing it. And so just one day I

561
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:08,500
Speaker 5:  felt, oh, maybe I'm the guy who's going to do that. And I just, I

562
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,240
Speaker 5:  just went for it. So

563
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,930
Speaker 2:  I built a sort of an outboard, you know, thing for it so that you could just

564
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:17,140
Speaker 2:  test to see that it worked and you were, you know, tracing all the leads

565
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,900
Speaker 2:  and whatnot. And you were pulling off little chips from Apple's own board

566
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,850
Speaker 2:  and transferring it over. What was that process like? Did you sort

567
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:27,610
Speaker 2:  of have a hunch? It would work or was it, was that part of the process of,

568
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:30,400
Speaker 2:  well, let's see if this thing will even work even with a, you know, big,

569
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,370
Speaker 2:  giant Frankenstein thing attached to the side of the phone.

570
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:36,880
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So I thought if it works with the big Frankenstein thing,

571
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,090
Speaker 5:  then there's no reason that it won't

572
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:43,930
Speaker 5:  work. If I redo it myself smaller, it's just so matter of

573
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:47,560
Speaker 5:  time and dedication and like fixing the problems.

574
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:51,460
Speaker 5:  But in theory, if you see it work here with you on eyes and it's

575
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:55,450
Speaker 5:  big, I know for a fact that there's a lot of stuff in here that are not

576
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:59,380
Speaker 5:  useful, like, like the lightning connector, I can remove it, I can replace

577
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:03,250
Speaker 5:  it before wires and things like that. So I knew then that I

578
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:06,880
Speaker 5:  could get it done. Eventually. I just didn't know how long it would take.

579
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,940
Speaker 2:  And one of the really surprising things to me, I mean, maybe not surprising,

580
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,720
Speaker 2:  but just something I haven't thought about is that you, without

581
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,200
Speaker 2:  working at a big company or whatever, you can, you can go out and design

582
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,560
Speaker 2:  a board and design a PCB and like, have it

583
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,590
Speaker 2:  manufactured for you. Can you tell us a little bit more about that process?

584
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:26,080
Speaker 2:  Because you know, I was like, how do you fit the electronics in there? And

585
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,780
Speaker 2:  like, I would, I would have wires everywhere. I would never have occurred

586
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,150
Speaker 2:  to me. Like, oh wait, I could just go into CAD. I can actually make a thing

587
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,010
Speaker 2:  and have somebody manufacture it for me.

588
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:36,610
Speaker 5:  So it's not too complicated. Like you said, you're going to a cat

589
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:40,390
Speaker 5:  software, a thing here. The most difficult part was

590
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:44,260
Speaker 5:  choosing the shape of the board because like my board

591
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:48,160
Speaker 5:  bends 90 degrees two times. And so you really need to have some kind

592
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,970
Speaker 5:  of like spatial awareness of like where it's going to

593
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:55,750
Speaker 5:  go inside the phone and, and really imagine it. And

594
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:59,410
Speaker 5:  once that's done, it's really like a flat surface. And then you place the

595
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:03,220
Speaker 5:  components where they are, and then you like run little

596
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:07,120
Speaker 5:  like traces. It's like little wires on them. And then you get

597
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,690
Speaker 5:  like a file that you send to hear it. It was a company in

598
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:14,650
Speaker 5:  China and they manufacture it for you and then they send it to you and then

599
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:18,550
Speaker 5:  you can sort their things on it. And yeah, it's, it's pretty amazing.

600
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:22,510
Speaker 5:  What, like before you, you couldn't do that. But now for the

601
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:25,930
Speaker 5:  last few years, there's really a lot of companies like low-cost companies

602
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:29,800
Speaker 5:  that came into the market and that proposal services

603
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,740
Speaker 5:  and like for the, do it yourself community, it's really like

604
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,950
Speaker 5:  awesome. Can, you can do things you couldn't do before.

605
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:40,010
Speaker 2:  And it really is incredible. Oh, I'm sorry. I meant to ask, why did you pick

606
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:42,890
Speaker 2:  the iPhone 10? Was it, it, was it just that it was like not too expensive

607
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:46,400
Speaker 2:  or was, do you think that there was stuff on newer I-phones that would've

608
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,260
Speaker 2:  made this project more complicated?

609
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:52,160
Speaker 5:  So first I started like more than a year and a half ago, almost

610
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,150
Speaker 5:  two years ago. So I think back then it was like the iPhone 11, the

611
00:41:56,150 --> 00:42:00,020
Speaker 5:  latest iPhone. And it was just, I didn't want to pick the latest

612
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,980
Speaker 5:  one because there was the most expensive and I went with the iPhone X

613
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,870
Speaker 5:  and also now looking back because I was thinking maybe I could forward it

614
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:11,330
Speaker 5:  to another iPhone, like the iPhone 12 and I from 13 or something like

615
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:15,260
Speaker 5:  that, I'm not sure I'll be the person to do that because

616
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,800
Speaker 5:  there's a, with like the repair community, they have kind of like

617
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,610
Speaker 5:  a, a war with apple on authorized

618
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:26,390
Speaker 5:  repairman and unauthorized. And now they're really like

619
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:30,320
Speaker 5:  putting serial numbers on parts. So you can't just like you, it

620
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,310
Speaker 5:  could be for bias screen and swap it up yourself. And so that

621
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:38,300
Speaker 5:  kind of annoys me. I thought if I, if I break something which I

622
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,960
Speaker 5:  did in phonetics, I broke the screen. I broke, I broke a few things that

623
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,800
Speaker 5:  I had to change multiple times. If I need to have those specialized

624
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,790
Speaker 5:  tools just to change my screen, once it doesn't make sense. Right.

625
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:53,480
Speaker 5:  And GI for next didn't have those problems. So

626
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:57,020
Speaker 5:  also it made a great fit for this.

627
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:00,980
Speaker 2:  Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. When you managed to get USB in and

628
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,890
Speaker 2:  working and got everything working, do you know if you were able to get,

629
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:06,510
Speaker 2:  I don't know, faster data speeds. One of the problems with lightning is it's

630
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:09,950
Speaker 2:  it's data speeds are slower. I'm assuming that it's just, you know, it's

631
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:13,520
Speaker 2:  the same interface and internally with the board you made. So it, it basically

632
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,700
Speaker 2:  still had USB two or whatever lightening speeds are, but I'm wondering, were

633
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,910
Speaker 2:  there any other functional differences that you noticed once you switched?

634
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:23,780
Speaker 5:  So that's the question I get a lot. I think so first about data,

635
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:27,440
Speaker 5:  there's a limitation inside the iPhone where the

636
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,040
Speaker 5:  connection to the main board only has, you could say two

637
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,790
Speaker 5:  wires, two data wires, and that's the limiting

638
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:38,540
Speaker 5:  factor. Like I don't see myself being able to change that that would

639
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,440
Speaker 5:  take care. Yeah.

640
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,380
Speaker 2:  You'd have to replace the whole main board. You're taking the whole thing.

641
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:43,520
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

642
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,360
Speaker 5:  So if you want to get into faster data transfers, USB

643
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:51,350
Speaker 5:  three, for example, then you need multiple pairs of

644
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:54,980
Speaker 5:  wires and use be true. Only had one. So they're called deep

645
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:58,880
Speaker 5:  loss and D minus data plus data minus signals. And so

646
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,660
Speaker 5:  in the iPhone, all the I-phones until the latest ones, all we'll

647
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:06,500
Speaker 5:  have this one pair. And so that's the limiting factor. You can't, you

648
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:10,280
Speaker 5:  can't change that. So yeah, the project is stuck at USB to

649
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,370
Speaker 5:  then about accessories. Can you plug in a

650
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:17,030
Speaker 5:  USB-C hub and then put HTMI sadly

651
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:20,900
Speaker 5:  nuts. You can't do that in this mud simply because the

652
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:24,710
Speaker 5:  accessories up use all have a different chip inside the

653
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:28,580
Speaker 5:  accessory. So the way I see it at least is if I

654
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:32,460
Speaker 5:  wanted to include all accessories, I would have to

655
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,790
Speaker 5:  include like a, this little chip inside my special

656
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:38,980
Speaker 5:  board and then have some kind of logic. Like, I'm not saying it's a

657
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:42,630
Speaker 5:  possible, I'm just saying it would take me maybe an extra two

658
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:46,500
Speaker 5:  years to add either by their accessories.

659
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,340
Speaker 5:  So then I fought charging and data is already

660
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:54,300
Speaker 5:  pretty good. Then if I have more time, I'll do something. I'll probably

661
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,680
Speaker 5:  add something else.

662
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,340
Speaker 2:  I wondered if it'd be possible to take, say the USB connection off an

663
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:03,120
Speaker 2:  iPad, like the new iPad mini and take those parts and plug them into an

664
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:07,020
Speaker 2:  iPhone. If it would just, you know, somehow work. But it sounds like it probably

665
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,150
Speaker 2:  wouldn't, it'd be a lot more complicated than that.

666
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:13,110
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I've thought about this in the beginning. So in the iPad, I think what

667
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:16,830
Speaker 5:  changes is that there is a software change. So iPad always

668
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:20,730
Speaker 5:  knows it's directly talking a USB language. And so

669
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:24,600
Speaker 5:  what's useful in inside the iPhone, like the hardware,

670
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,590
Speaker 5:  which has be the little connector, but the little connector I can order

671
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:32,370
Speaker 5:  it for $2 of any website. It's, it's no different

672
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:36,030
Speaker 5:  than the others. So the thing in the iPad is that it's the

673
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:39,630
Speaker 5:  software already knows it's talking USB and then goes through the USB

674
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:43,560
Speaker 5:  connector. Whereas here, if I would want to do something like that, I

675
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,070
Speaker 5:  would have to change the software on the iPhone so that it

676
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:50,670
Speaker 5:  knows it talks to you is B and not lightning,

677
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:54,330
Speaker 5:  but that would change completely the scope of the project. It would be

678
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:58,110
Speaker 5:  like jailbreaking GA phone or something like that whole thing. And

679
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:01,830
Speaker 5:  so here, it was only a hardware rack where we took the

680
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:05,790
Speaker 5:  chip that does the conversion in the cable, and we

681
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:09,750
Speaker 5:  integrated it inside the iPhone so that it does the job for

682
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:13,140
Speaker 5:  us without having to worry about software or anything else.

683
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:16,770
Speaker 2:  Were you surprised at your ability to, I don't know, fit the

684
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:19,830
Speaker 2:  larger USB-C plug at the bottom of the phone? I, you know, you did a really

685
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:23,730
Speaker 2:  clever thing to, to mill out the space, finding the space inside

686
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:27,630
Speaker 2:  for your adapter, where you concerned early on like, oh, wait, apple goes

687
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:30,420
Speaker 2:  with lightening. They must have to cause it's thinner. There's no way this

688
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,660
Speaker 2:  could work. Or just from taking apart. I-phones did you know, like, come

689
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,700
Speaker 2:  on, this is, this is actually possible.

690
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,510
Speaker 5:  So it worried me a little bit at the beginning because it

691
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:43,290
Speaker 5:  does look bigger when, well it lays bigger cause I had to drill out the

692
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:47,250
Speaker 5:  hole. But when I went to choose actually the connector

693
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:50,910
Speaker 5:  that I was telling you about, like actually order it on a website, just that

694
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:54,360
Speaker 5:  little connect, her metallic piece, every time you ordered those

695
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,270
Speaker 5:  components, there is like 2d drawings with the

696
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:01,260
Speaker 5:  dimensions. And so I went through maybe like 50 of them or

697
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:05,040
Speaker 5:  something like that to look at their dimensions and compare them

698
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,700
Speaker 5:  with the lightning connector. And I was trying to find one

699
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,640
Speaker 5:  that could actually maybe be smaller than the lightning

700
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,120
Speaker 5:  connector. And I did in the end. I did find one that was

701
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:18,630
Speaker 5:  smaller. So the connector where you plug in the cable is

702
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:22,620
Speaker 5:  bigger, but from the outside, like the volume that the

703
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:26,310
Speaker 5:  connector takes, the one I chose is actually smaller than the lightning

704
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:30,160
Speaker 5:  connector. And so that gave me some extra room to then

705
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,640
Speaker 5:  do a little 3d printed bracket that holds the connector. So it

706
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:37,630
Speaker 5:  doesn't when you plug in the cable, it, it feels strong. So yeah, I

707
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:41,350
Speaker 5:  think that's a, that's pretty funny to know about that in the end is that

708
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:44,260
Speaker 5:  micro negative is actually smaller than the lightning connector.

709
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:47,500
Speaker 2:  And so you, you put all this on get hub and there was a step where you had

710
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,440
Speaker 2:  to get, like you had to order some extra parts. Can you talk about the process

711
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:54,430
Speaker 2:  of sort of putting your, your process out there, the worlds so that anybody

712
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:57,760
Speaker 2:  might theoretically be able to, to redo what you did?

713
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,600
Speaker 5:  So when I was trying to reverse engineer this little

714
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,200
Speaker 5:  connector that apple builds for their cables,

715
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,100
Speaker 5:  right. I saw that there was kind of, it wasn't impossible

716
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:12,610
Speaker 5:  to do, but it was kind of hard to do because they make it. So it's hard.

717
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:16,360
Speaker 5:  They make it. So people don't go put their nose in that cable and see how

718
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,080
Speaker 5:  it works, because then maybe someone in China will make a fake connector

719
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,920
Speaker 5:  and then sell it on their website. And then they lose revenue for those

720
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,430
Speaker 5:  accessory sales. And then I thought, if I

721
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:31,330
Speaker 5:  continue pursuing this connector, then it's first. I

722
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:35,080
Speaker 5:  don't think I'll be able to make it open source because if I do, then I'm

723
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:39,010
Speaker 5:  basically putting out the layout of what apple builds.

724
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:42,670
Speaker 5:  It's kind of like, I put the plans out there, how to

725
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:46,660
Speaker 5:  remake what they do. Right. And then here I would definitely

726
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:47,620
Speaker 5:  get in trouble.

727
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:51,010
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Regardless of whether or not you are right for the various

728
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:54,250
Speaker 2:  DMTA style rules, apple would not be afraid to go after you and you don't

729
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:57,370
Speaker 2:  want to deal with that hassle, even if you were in the right.

730
00:48:57,370 --> 00:49:00,910
Speaker 5:  So I knew, I knew from the beginning, if I did, that would get in

731
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:04,480
Speaker 5:  trouble. And then I, I started, I was doing some research on the

732
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,380
Speaker 5:  connector and then one day I stumbled across an article that was

733
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:12,280
Speaker 5:  saying, actually, someone did what you want to do already.

734
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:16,120
Speaker 5:  Someone hacked that cable and they're selling fake cables on the internet

735
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,780
Speaker 5:  for cheaper so that you can charge your iPhone or your, your

736
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:23,680
Speaker 5:  airports with that cable. And it won't give you an error message

737
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,640
Speaker 5:  saying this cable is not the original. Then I, it like clicked in my

738
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,090
Speaker 5:  mind, Hey, maybe I can hack them. I can hack the

739
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:34,570
Speaker 5:  hackers. And so then when I posted my plans

740
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:38,470
Speaker 5:  online, I'm not posting the plans of what apple did.

741
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:42,340
Speaker 5:  I'm posting the plans of the people who hacked apple. So it's not, I'm not

742
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,170
Speaker 5:  really doing anything wrong. Right.

743
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:47,110
Speaker 2:  Yeah. That's great. And why did you post the plans? I mean, you know, you

744
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:50,320
Speaker 2:  could have been like, look, look what I did, but like, was it important to

745
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:54,220
Speaker 2:  you to put this up on, on GitHub instead of, you know, just like a blog post

746
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,210
Speaker 2:  or something?

747
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:58,630
Speaker 5:  Well, here, you know, there's files, right? There's the schematics for the

748
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:02,380
Speaker 5:  electronics. And I thought probably some people who want to contribute to

749
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:06,250
Speaker 5:  that and then they can actually add their own files to it. Of course,

750
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:09,580
Speaker 5:  that I need to look into it, see if it's good and then I can add it. But

751
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:13,390
Speaker 5:  then if it's like a hub, well, it's got the get hub, but if it's like a

752
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:17,350
Speaker 5:  hub for this project, then people can go on it and maybe they

753
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:21,070
Speaker 5:  can download their own files and then make their own version of it,

754
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:24,430
Speaker 5:  modify it however they want. I think that's very interesting

755
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:28,220
Speaker 2:  Using the iPhone that you modded as your phone,

756
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:31,850
Speaker 5:  I've used it for a few days just to see that it wouldn't burn in my

757
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:35,750
Speaker 5:  hand, but no, I'm, I'm using outside of some

758
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:38,240
Speaker 5:  phone as a, as a daily driver. If you could

759
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,230
Speaker 2:  Speak briefly, what do you think of USB-C itself as

760
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:45,920
Speaker 2:  a spec, as a standard? Do you really like it? I know

761
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,850
Speaker 2:  apple was evangelizing it early on, but do you think it's a good

762
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:53,120
Speaker 2:  plug? Do you think it's a good standard or is it just that, it's the thing

763
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:56,330
Speaker 2:  that everyone's using and that's why you wanted to get it going on the,

764
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:59,690
Speaker 5:  But I think it's an aspect that some sometimes not talked about too much

765
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:03,620
Speaker 5:  on why it's, it would be interesting to have only one connector. Like

766
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:07,490
Speaker 5:  you can't save things only when they go your way. Like you can't

767
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:11,420
Speaker 5:  stop including a charger in your iPhone in the box and say it's

768
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:15,140
Speaker 5:  to reduce waste. And then for other things like the connector, you

769
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:18,830
Speaker 5:  act the complete opposite, you know what I mean? So I've, yeah. I think it's

770
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:22,760
Speaker 5:  important to be consistent with what you say and with

771
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,690
Speaker 5:  what you think. And I think that's an important aspect to talk about.

772
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:30,410
Speaker 2:  Do you think it's worth the trade off of having the same plug,

773
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:34,070
Speaker 2:  given all these extra complications and things you need to know about? Because

774
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:37,520
Speaker 2:  in the old world, every plug was a different shape. And so you knew what

775
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,370
Speaker 2:  the plug would do based on its shape. Do you think that we're better off

776
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:43,880
Speaker 2:  having all the plugs have that same USB shape it, but you need to

777
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:47,360
Speaker 2:  understand what the cable or the, you know, devices are capable of,

778
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:51,350
Speaker 5:  I think we're better off if it's safe. So I mean, if the worst

779
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:55,040
Speaker 5:  that can happen is that you're charged your Mac book very slowly

780
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:59,000
Speaker 5:  instead of at the normal speed. I think, I think it's worth it, but I

781
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,900
Speaker 5:  do think that in the mid to long-term, there needs

782
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:06,890
Speaker 5:  to be solutions to that. And I think that's things that I will

783
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:10,880
Speaker 5:  explore in my channel if I, if, if, if it's something that is of

784
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,660
Speaker 5:  interest to people, and I know it's of interest to me, because I'm here talking

785
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:18,500
Speaker 5:  to you about this right now, I'll definitely do some more research

786
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:22,220
Speaker 5:  about that and maybe propose ideas that are mine are not mine

787
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:24,980
Speaker 5:  and get people talking about the subject.

788
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,860
Speaker 2:  Well, cool, man. It's a, it's a really fun project. I'm really glad you did

789
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:30,890
Speaker 2:  it. It's it's really nice. If nothing else, to be able to point to it and

790
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:34,580
Speaker 2:  be like, yep. See, like nothing, nothing exploded. The world didn't come

791
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:38,450
Speaker 2:  to an end. The phone still works fine. Nobody, nobody got hurt. It still

792
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:42,340
Speaker 2:  fits. So if nothing else congrats for showing everybody that it's,

793
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:43,880
Speaker 2:  it's absolutely possible.

794
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:44,960
Speaker 5:  Thank you. Thank you so

795
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:50,570
Speaker 5:  much.

796
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:54,500
Speaker 2:  So now Ken probably has the only iPhone of the world that has

797
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,460
Speaker 2:  a proper USBC port on it outside of Apple's labs. And I

798
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:02,180
Speaker 2:  am, I have to admit insanely jealous. So look, we know that

799
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:06,020
Speaker 2:  apple doesn't want to put USBC on an iPhone,

800
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:09,650
Speaker 2:  but if they want to keep ports on it in general, they might actually be

801
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:11,870
Speaker 2:  ordered to make the switch

802
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:15,680
Speaker 10:  Commissioners proposing common USB-C charging ports for

803
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,980
Speaker 10:  all new smartphones, iPads, tablets, cameras, and

804
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:21,080
Speaker 10:  headphones

805
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,260
Speaker 11:  In terms of waste. This is significant because this measure will allow us

806
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:26,970
Speaker 11:  to save one tons of electronic waste and

807
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:30,930
Speaker 11:  2,600 tons of raw materials per year. There is also the

808
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:34,590
Speaker 11:  impact on CO2 emissions. It will save 180,000

809
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:37,680
Speaker 11:  tons of CO2 equivalent per year.

810
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,640
Speaker 2:  So the European union may speed up the process of forcing companies to adopt

811
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:45,240
Speaker 2:  USB-C. But speed up is a relative term because the

812
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,630
Speaker 2:  European union has been talking about charging standards for devices for

813
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:52,050
Speaker 2:  around a decade or so. In fact, one of the reasons that a bunch of phones

814
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:55,950
Speaker 2:  switched over to micro USB from all of the proprietary charging standards

815
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:59,910
Speaker 2:  was the European union, tried to force that as the standard, and

816
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:03,810
Speaker 2:  now we're moving onto USB-C. So now they're pressuring apple

817
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:07,440
Speaker 2:  to switch the iPhone over to USB-C and in

818
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,440
Speaker 2:  theory, that could happen, but the reality could turn out to be much, much

819
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,190
Speaker 2:  different. And actually, I also talked to him Gartenberg a little bit about

820
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:15,030
Speaker 2:  all this.

821
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:18,840
Speaker 4:  So the proposal is mandatory USBC

822
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:22,470
Speaker 4:  on all devices for smartphones and other electronics, common charging

823
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:26,430
Speaker 4:  port. The goal here is to cut down on e-waste, by letting people

824
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,610
Speaker 4:  reuse their existing chargers and cables that you don't have to get a new

825
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:33,270
Speaker 4:  charger. Every time devices won't have to include charges in the box anymore,

826
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,120
Speaker 4:  which is a trend we've already started to see with companies like apple and

827
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:39,990
Speaker 4:  Samsung. And it notably would only apply to wired

828
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:43,530
Speaker 4:  ports, not wireless ones. So this is, as you said, it's really the

829
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:47,250
Speaker 4:  culmination of like a decades long process. The EU

830
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:51,000
Speaker 4:  actually did have a similar thing where they had required

831
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,930
Speaker 4:  micro USB, but that original voluntary thing

832
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:58,800
Speaker 4:  was less strict and also allowed,

833
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,980
Speaker 4:  you know, the loophole of you could include an adapter in the box,

834
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:05,970
Speaker 4:  right? Which apple did for a while, when you bought an iPhone in the

835
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:09,030
Speaker 4:  EU, it would come in addition to a lightening cable, it would include in

836
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:12,690
Speaker 4:  the box like a $15 low freebie of lightning to micro

837
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:16,200
Speaker 4:  USB cable so that you could use your existing

838
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,950
Speaker 4:  chargers and plugs with that device, which is really the thing that the EU

839
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:23,860
Speaker 4:  is looking to try and cut down on under this proposed rule,

840
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:27,750
Speaker 4:  you would not be allowed to sell a device. You know,

841
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:31,590
Speaker 4:  if it has a form of wireless charging, it has to have USBC.

842
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:35,400
Speaker 4:  So for example, apple in theory could make, you know, an iPhone

843
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:39,150
Speaker 4:  EU edition that had a USB-C port and a lightening port,

844
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:43,080
Speaker 4:  but in theory, under the rules, it would not be allowed to just offer a

845
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:43,890
Speaker 4:  lightening port.

846
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:46,800
Speaker 2:  Would they be allowed to offer a phone that has only wireless

847
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:50,700
Speaker 4:  Charging, only wireless charging would be allowed? Okay. The exception here

848
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:54,540
Speaker 4:  includes the fact that it only applies to it common wired

849
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:58,470
Speaker 4:  port. If the device doesn't offer wired charging, it is not required

850
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:02,370
Speaker 4:  to fall in. It doesn't have to abide by that rule. I see the proposal

851
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:05,310
Speaker 4:  is right now, also just a proposal it's still needs to pass a vote in the

852
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:08,790
Speaker 4:  European parliament. And then if it is actually adopted as

853
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:12,630
Speaker 4:  law device manufacturers, like apple will then have

854
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:16,440
Speaker 4:  two years to comply with the new rules. So there could still be

855
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,400
Speaker 4:  a fair amount of time before this actually impacts don't necessarily

856
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,070
Speaker 4:  expect the iPhone 13 to suddenly have a USBC port.

857
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:24,820
Speaker 4:  Yeah.

858
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:27,220
Speaker 2:  So how do you think it's going to shake out? I mean, we, it took us this

859
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:31,180
Speaker 2:  long to get to the proposal that apple is strenuously fighting. I know you're

860
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:35,170
Speaker 2:  not an expert in European law, but do you foresee apple like

861
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:37,840
Speaker 2:  saying sure. You know what, you're right. We're working on.

862
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:41,650
Speaker 4:  On the one hand, there's not a lot of wiggle room in this proposal, which

863
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:45,550
Speaker 4:  would require either apple will have to ship a USBC iPhone.

864
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:48,910
Speaker 4:  It could limit it. Geographically could only sell them in the EU. It could

865
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:52,690
Speaker 4:  take an approach similar to the bundled in adapters that it offered at the

866
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:56,590
Speaker 4:  time. I assume apple as a company will be doing everything it can, you

867
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:59,380
Speaker 4:  know, from a lobbying and legal side, to make sure that this doesn't actually

868
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:02,860
Speaker 4:  become law. It also could try and jump to a

869
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:06,850
Speaker 4:  proprietary wirelessly charging, iPhone. The issue there is sort

870
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:10,540
Speaker 4:  of getting the genie back in the bottle because apple can sell a

871
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:14,290
Speaker 4:  wireless charging iPhone or a wireless protocol iPhone, but it

872
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:18,040
Speaker 4:  already supports Chyanne it's stuff, which is a universal charging

873
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,610
Speaker 4:  standard. It's actually the first and really only, you know,

874
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:25,540
Speaker 4:  cross apple universal charging standard that you can use to charge an iPhone

875
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:27,040
Speaker 4:  and something else. Yeah.

876
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,070
Speaker 2:  I mean, there are ways to transfer data wirelessly right next to each other.

877
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:34,030
Speaker 2:  Like there, there have been phones, the failed essential phone that actually

878
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:37,960
Speaker 2:  literally had a little near field wireless USB thing. So you

879
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,870
Speaker 2:  could attach things to, and who can communicate over a relatively slow, but

880
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:44,170
Speaker 2:  it was there like wireless USB. So these things are possible. We just have

881
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:47,230
Speaker 2:  no idea how aggressively apple is pursuing them.

882
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:51,130
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But the other issue is, is that there's no real wireless solution that

883
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:54,700
Speaker 4:  exists yet. That's better than wire charging. There's a reason we use wired

884
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:58,390
Speaker 4:  charging for things which is transferring data. Wirelessly is not as fast

885
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:02,170
Speaker 4:  as transferring at wired transferring power. Wirelessly is not as efficient.

886
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:06,070
Speaker 4:  And even if apple can circumvent those two issues and come up

887
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:10,060
Speaker 4:  with a super fast, super power efficient way of doing power and data

888
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:13,810
Speaker 4:  transfer it also then has the trap of its own argument, which

889
00:58:13,810 --> 00:58:17,410
Speaker 4:  is switching away from lightening to something else will generate a huge

890
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:21,070
Speaker 4:  amount of e-waste. And it'll inconvenience customers switching from

891
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:25,030
Speaker 4:  lightening to a new proprietary magnetic wired thing with a dock

892
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:29,020
Speaker 4:  and a cable and everything will generate a huge amount of e-waste and

893
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:31,330
Speaker 4:  generate more waste than just switching to USBC

894
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:40,840
Speaker 4:  would.

895
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:44,320
Speaker 2:  Okay. We have learned a lot here about USB-C its

896
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:48,280
Speaker 2:  advantages disadvantages and the wacky things

897
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:52,180
Speaker 2:  that makes us do in a confusing tech market. So here we are,

898
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:55,960
Speaker 2:  but where are we going? What's next for USBC?

899
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:59,290
Speaker 2:  How will the technology advance I asked rod with be,

900
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:03,070
Speaker 3:  I think the next thing will be higher data rates. As we've seen the power

901
00:59:03,070 --> 00:59:06,820
Speaker 3:  go from a hundred Watts to 240 Watts, the data rates go from five to

902
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:10,750
Speaker 3:  10 to 20 to 40. I expect, you'll see, 60 gigabits a second

903
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:13,750
Speaker 3:  with a Thunderbolt five or something. I've got no internal information, of

904
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:17,020
Speaker 3:  course. And even if I did, I wouldn't be able to disclose it, but that's,

905
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:20,960
Speaker 3:  but that's just what you expect. People always want faster data, always want

906
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,950
Speaker 3:  bigger video screens, which means more data being transferred across the

907
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:28,880
Speaker 3:  table. So I think at the moment, the research is there

908
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,540
Speaker 3:  to be able to send more data across the same cable. And the

909
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:36,500
Speaker 3:  spec is now there to be able to send a higher power across the

910
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:40,331
Speaker 3:  same cable. So I think we'll see a two hundred and forty one

911
00:59:40,331 --> 00:59:44,000
Speaker 3:  sixty gigabits per second data cable is the next step.

912
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,810
Speaker 2:  This is why I keep bringing in rod because he's got me excited for the

913
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:51,770
Speaker 2:  near future, but he also makes me take a step back and realize how

914
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:54,440
Speaker 2:  we actually got here with USB-C.

915
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:58,370
Speaker 3:  The emphasis, I guess, is there is a lot of work that happens

916
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:02,270
Speaker 3:  through a lot of engineers and a lot of different companies to make sure

917
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:06,230
Speaker 3:  that when you plug a USB cable into a computer that actually

918
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:09,800
Speaker 3:  does something and it's incredible the number of ways that it could

919
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:13,550
Speaker 3:  possibly not work, but somehow through all this hard work,

920
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:16,160
Speaker 3:  usually, you know, 98% of the time just does

921
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,260
Speaker 3:  work.

922
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:22,070
Speaker 2:  Here's how I deal with all of this confusion. I just make sure that

923
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:25,970
Speaker 2:  I know which of my USBC cables are good and can do the

924
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:29,900
Speaker 2:  things that I need. And I e-waste the bad ones for

925
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:33,680
Speaker 2:  me. I know that the cables that I get from apple and Google tend to work

926
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:37,430
Speaker 2:  better and they also happen to be white cables. So I keep

927
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:41,150
Speaker 2:  those cables around for when I need a good USB-C cable,

928
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:44,840
Speaker 2:  but for the cheap stuff like charging earbuds or cameras or

929
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:48,350
Speaker 2:  whatever, I have a bunch of cheap cables that happen to be

930
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:51,770
Speaker 2:  black. And if I need something truly

931
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:55,220
Speaker 2:  reliable, like the main cable I plug in my laptop with

932
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:58,910
Speaker 2:  Thunderbolt cables usually have a little lightning bolt on them. So I keep

933
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:02,870
Speaker 2:  an eye out for that. Is that a perfect solution? No, not

934
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:06,860
Speaker 2:  even a little, but is it better to have fewer

935
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:10,400
Speaker 2:  cables? Yes, actually it really

936
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,210
Speaker 2:  is. And as we're going to see in this series of special

937
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:18,050
Speaker 2:  Tuesday, Vergecast episodes do standards and technologies do

938
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:21,680
Speaker 2:  solve real problems, but they don't solve them quickly.

939
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,980
Speaker 2:  And they do bring up new problems of their own in the

940
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:28,820
Speaker 2:  meantime. And the truth is we live in the

941
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:31,040
Speaker 2:  meantime. It's always the

942
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,250
Speaker 2:  meantime. Thank you for listening to this.

943
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:38,120
Speaker 2:  USB-C spectacular. We brought the term back.

944
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:41,390
Speaker 2:  See what I did there. You're welcome. I'm sorry. This episode of the verge

945
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:45,170
Speaker 2:  cast was made by Andrew Moreno, Liam, James and B Dieter

946
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:49,160
Speaker 2:  Bohn special, thanks to Haim. Gartenberg Ken PNL and rod would

947
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:52,850
Speaker 2:  be who gets a second extra. Thanks for working on web iOS

948
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:56,600
Speaker 2:  internals back of the day. Thank you to all of them for lighting us along

949
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:00,260
Speaker 2:  this journey. The Vergecast we'll be back on Friday and my Tuesday

950
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:01,670
Speaker 2:  episodes will return. Next

951
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:04,520
Speaker 2:  week.

952
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:55,170
Speaker 13:  Hi there it's Peter Kafka. And I wanted to tell you that we've wrapped our

953
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:58,920
Speaker 13:  latest season of land of the giants, the podcast that

954
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:02,820
Speaker 13:  explores the biggest, most important tech companies of our time. This time

955
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:06,630
Speaker 13:  we looked at apple company that changed what a computer is and then change

956
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:09,870
Speaker 13:  what a phone is. The iPhone has given apple tremendous

957
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:13,860
Speaker 13:  power, but it's forced the company to make compromises that didn't expect.

958
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:14,430
Speaker 13:  Apple says

959
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:18,360
Speaker 14:  Privacy as a fundamental human, right? But it also conflicts with its need

960
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:21,780
Speaker 14:  to follow the laws of every country. It operates in, especially in

961
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:25,290
Speaker 13:  And it's app store generates billions in profit, but that doesn't work for

962
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:25,950
Speaker 13:  everyone.

963
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:29,730
Speaker 15:  Apple basically is preventing me small business owner and

964
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:32,610
Speaker 15:  servicing my customers the way I've serviced them for many, many years for

965
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:35,130
Speaker 15:  decades. And they're saying, no, you can't do it now.

966
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:38,070
Speaker 13:  I mean, well, what exactly is going on with apple TV

967
01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:39,390
Speaker 13:  plus

968
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:42,270
Speaker 16:  Apple doesn't want to win this trimming wars. They want to be extremely

969
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:44,670
Speaker 16:  highly regarded for their tastes

970
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:48,420
Speaker 13:  Land of the giants, the apple revolution Recode and the box media podcast
