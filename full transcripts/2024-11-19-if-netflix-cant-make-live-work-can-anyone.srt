Description: Richard Lawler joins the show to chat about the Tyson / Paul fight, and more importantly the fact that Netflix didn't seem to be able to keep up. As live sports — and TV in general — move toward streaming, are even the biggest names in tech ready for what's coming? After that, Roland Allen, the author of The Notebook: A History of Thinking on Paper, tells us about the history of the notebook, and why we've been writing things down about our lives for centuries. Even in a digital world, Allen argues, you just can't beat the notebook. Finally, a question from the Vergecast Hotline sends producer Will Poor down a TikTok Shop rabbit hole.

2
00:00:03,185 --> 00:00:07,035
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of the Bullet Journal Method.

3
00:00:07,415 --> 00:00:10,955
Speaker 2:  I'm your friend David Pierce, and I am sitting here on a

4
00:00:11,065 --> 00:00:14,995
Speaker 2:  weekday buying candy on TikTok. Like, I

5
00:00:14,995 --> 00:00:18,155
Speaker 2:  don't know how this happened, but suddenly my algorithm is just absolutely

6
00:00:18,665 --> 00:00:22,555
Speaker 2:  overrun by freeze dried Skittles, which are a

7
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:26,235
Speaker 2:  thing you can buy. And there's like a sour coated

8
00:00:26,305 --> 00:00:29,915
Speaker 2:  gushers thing that everybody's really excited about. But the biggest thing

9
00:00:29,915 --> 00:00:33,795
Speaker 2:  that's happening all over TikTok is Swedish candy. There are these things

10
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:37,475
Speaker 2:  called bubs. They're little like skulls that are

11
00:00:38,065 --> 00:00:41,595
Speaker 2:  massively popular. People are so excited about them, they sell out like crazy.

12
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:45,755
Speaker 2:  There's this company called Bon Bon that has absolutely blown up

13
00:00:45,855 --> 00:00:49,315
Speaker 2:  on TikTok. There's something happening inside of Candy Talk

14
00:00:49,935 --> 00:00:52,875
Speaker 2:  and I can't figure out what it is. I can't figure out how it works where

15
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:56,235
Speaker 2:  all these companies and people are getting this candy from and repackaging

16
00:00:56,235 --> 00:00:59,915
Speaker 2:  it and selling it to people. But I'm now deep down this rabbit hole.

17
00:01:00,195 --> 00:01:04,155
Speaker 2:  I bought candy on a TikTok live stream last night while I was

18
00:01:04,155 --> 00:01:07,355
Speaker 2:  walking my dog. It's a real thing that happened and I bought it on the stream

19
00:01:07,695 --> 00:01:10,795
Speaker 2:  and the guy was like, oh, oh David, thanks for your order. I'm gonna give

20
00:01:10,795 --> 00:01:14,635
Speaker 2:  you extra sour powder because you ordered on the live stream. And I was

21
00:01:14,635 --> 00:01:18,475
Speaker 2:  like really excited for a long time that this was a thing that

22
00:01:18,475 --> 00:01:21,435
Speaker 2:  had happened to me. It's coming in two to four days, apparently.

23
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:26,155
Speaker 2:  Is it anything? Is it food? Did I order it from an actual

24
00:01:26,155 --> 00:01:29,915
Speaker 2:  company? I literally have no idea. That's the TikTok shop, but it's

25
00:01:30,115 --> 00:01:33,995
Speaker 2:  possible there is going to be an alarming amount of candy coming to my

26
00:01:33,995 --> 00:01:37,835
Speaker 2:  house very soon. And frankly, that's great news. Anyway,

27
00:01:38,055 --> 00:01:41,315
Speaker 2:  we are not here to talk about Kand. I have a feeling I will be talking more

28
00:01:41,315 --> 00:01:45,275
Speaker 2:  about Kand over time, but not today. Today we're gonna do two things. First,

29
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:48,875
Speaker 2:  we're gonna talk about the Jake Paul, Mike Tyson fight on Netflix.

30
00:01:49,715 --> 00:01:52,115
Speaker 2:  I don't really care about the fight, but I care a lot about what it means

31
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:55,875
Speaker 2:  that Netflix had this massively popular event

32
00:01:56,615 --> 00:02:00,235
Speaker 2:  and it didn't go great. And Netflix has some more massively popular events

33
00:02:00,365 --> 00:02:03,835
Speaker 2:  about to happen. And we're also just at a really interesting moment in the

34
00:02:03,835 --> 00:02:07,795
Speaker 2:  sports streaming world where if Netflix can't do it, can anyone,

35
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:12,035
Speaker 2:  we're gonna talk about it. Also, I'm gonna talk to Roland Allen who

36
00:02:12,035 --> 00:02:15,995
Speaker 2:  wrote a book about the history of notebooks. And actually

37
00:02:16,265 --> 00:02:20,155
Speaker 2:  what he wrote is a history of civilization told through The

38
00:02:20,395 --> 00:02:24,275
Speaker 2:  Notebook. He makes a really fun case for why pen and paper has been

39
00:02:24,275 --> 00:02:28,235
Speaker 2:  so important in history, why it's so important now, and why even in

40
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:31,875
Speaker 2:  an increasingly digital world, writing things down in a notebook is not going

41
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:35,515
Speaker 2:  away. Super fun. We also have a hotline question that we're gonna get into

42
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:39,475
Speaker 2:  that sent our producer will pour down kind of a wild rabbit hole

43
00:02:39,655 --> 00:02:43,635
Speaker 2:  of, again, the TikTok shop. It's a weird world out there. All that is coming

44
00:02:43,635 --> 00:02:47,195
Speaker 2:  up in just a second. But first. I've now been staring at these freeze dried

45
00:02:47,195 --> 00:02:50,875
Speaker 2:  Skittles for too long and I'm gonna buy them.

46
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:53,635
Speaker 2:  Wish me luck. This is The Vergecast. We'll be right back.

47
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:33,205
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. All right, so Friday night,

48
00:03:34,155 --> 00:03:37,805
Speaker 2:  Jake Paul, Mike Tyson. It both was and

49
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:41,605
Speaker 2:  was not the fight of the year. I don't know

50
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:45,165
Speaker 2:  anything or particularly care about boxing if I'm completely honest with

51
00:03:45,165 --> 00:03:48,565
Speaker 2:  you. But the thing I heard from everybody is that actually the undercard,

52
00:03:48,585 --> 00:03:51,645
Speaker 2:  all the fights that were before the main fight was great. Lots of good fights.

53
00:03:51,825 --> 00:03:55,685
Speaker 2:  But then Jake Paul versus Mike Tyson, eh, I mean, it was

54
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:59,485
Speaker 2:  like a YouTuber versus a man in his late fifties. I don't really know

55
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:03,445
Speaker 2:  what anybody expected, but that is the fight that we got. Anyway,

56
00:04:03,885 --> 00:04:07,565
Speaker 2:  I think the more interesting story here has less to do with that fight

57
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:11,165
Speaker 2:  itself and more to do with how things went on Netflix

58
00:04:11,545 --> 00:04:15,365
Speaker 2:  and what it says about what Netflix is ready for as it tries to take

59
00:04:15,365 --> 00:04:19,085
Speaker 2:  over live TV and what the whole streaming industry is ready for.

60
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:23,005
Speaker 2:  Lots to talk about. There's lots of this stuff left to come. The tests keep

61
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:26,605
Speaker 2:  coming for these companies. So figured it was a good time to check in and

62
00:04:26,605 --> 00:04:29,725
Speaker 2:  nobody better to do it with than Richard Lawler. Richard, hello.

63
00:04:30,465 --> 00:04:30,685
Speaker 4:  Hey,

64
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:33,245
Speaker 2:  I just saw you the other day. This was very exciting.

65
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,085
Speaker 4:  We were in person and you understood that I exist outside this room.

66
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:40,405
Speaker 2:  I did. It's useful to be reminded of that every once in a while, but not

67
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,685
Speaker 2:  like for too long. I think we got about the right amount of time near each

68
00:04:43,685 --> 00:04:47,405
Speaker 2:  other. This this is, this is good. Yep. All right. So

69
00:04:47,735 --> 00:04:50,045
Speaker 2:  first question, did you watch the fight on Friday?

70
00:04:51,065 --> 00:04:54,305
Speaker 4:  I did not watch the fight because doing anything else was a better choice.

71
00:04:55,065 --> 00:04:58,985
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I mean I, I would say, as it turns out, that is largely correct.

72
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:03,225
Speaker 2:  It is a real bummer that this whole thing was not about a sport. I enjoy

73
00:05:03,335 --> 00:05:06,745
Speaker 2:  more than boxing between YouTubers and old men. But

74
00:05:07,305 --> 00:05:08,305
Speaker 2:  I last here we are

75
00:05:08,845 --> 00:05:11,785
Speaker 4:  As, as I said on social media, if I wanted to see a YouTuber fight an old

76
00:05:11,785 --> 00:05:13,545
Speaker 4:  man, I would just go punch a YouTuber.

77
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:18,225
Speaker 4:  I can put that fight on myself right now.

78
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:21,665
Speaker 2:  It's, it's a beautiful thing. If, you walk outside, I'm sure someone is filming

79
00:05:21,745 --> 00:05:24,945
Speaker 2:  a TikTok and you can just punch them in the face and, and here we are and

80
00:05:25,145 --> 00:05:28,785
Speaker 2:  apparently 60 million people will watch it. If. you do. But I think the,

81
00:05:28,845 --> 00:05:32,545
Speaker 2:  the reason I wanted to talk to you about this is we've talked a lot over

82
00:05:32,545 --> 00:05:36,175
Speaker 2:  the last couple of years about basically the question is

83
00:05:36,175 --> 00:05:40,135
Speaker 2:  streaming ready for sports? And it's been, it's been

84
00:05:40,135 --> 00:05:44,015
Speaker 2:  coming, it's been happening. Amazon is kind of making it work with

85
00:05:44,295 --> 00:05:48,135
Speaker 2:  football, but like the NFL is is the thing, right? And every streaming

86
00:05:48,295 --> 00:05:51,495
Speaker 2:  platform wants the NFL. A bunch of them have gotten it. Netflix is gonna

87
00:05:51,495 --> 00:05:55,335
Speaker 2:  have it on Christmas day. And I think to me, the

88
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:57,805
Speaker 2:  single most surprising thing that happened this weekend was that Netflix

89
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,125
Speaker 2:  was not ready for this fight.

90
00:06:00,495 --> 00:06:03,245
Speaker 4:  You'd think they would've been, right? They have the data, they know how

91
00:06:03,245 --> 00:06:05,685
Speaker 4:  many customers they have. They know how many people were interested in this

92
00:06:05,685 --> 00:06:09,125
Speaker 4:  fight. They know how heavily they promoted it. They know that there wasn't

93
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:12,925
Speaker 4:  really anything else to do on Friday night, it felt like. And still

94
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:16,525
Speaker 4:  they were surprised somehow. They just weren't ready for the moment.

95
00:06:17,035 --> 00:06:20,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah. A and am I crazy for thinking that if anyone should be able to

96
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:24,645
Speaker 2:  do this just from a pure technical deliver, the

97
00:06:24,645 --> 00:06:27,925
Speaker 2:  bits in high quality to people perspective, it ought to be Netflix.

98
00:06:28,935 --> 00:06:32,805
Speaker 4:  You'd think so, but delivering things live is very different. And I think

99
00:06:32,805 --> 00:06:36,365
Speaker 4:  that's what we found basically. Every time there's a massive event and every

100
00:06:36,365 --> 00:06:39,565
Speaker 4:  time we've had these Super Bowls streaming now for years that they've, they've

101
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,445
Speaker 4:  been available on the internet each and every time. It's just a little bit

102
00:06:42,605 --> 00:06:45,085
Speaker 4:  glitchier than you'd expect. Yeah. Even though they know how many people

103
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:48,565
Speaker 4:  are going to tune in. Because it's hard because delivering these things with

104
00:06:48,765 --> 00:06:52,205
Speaker 4:  milliseconds and just fractions of a second of delay is

105
00:06:52,565 --> 00:06:56,525
Speaker 4:  difficult. Like, like you can cache the streams and videos and If, you

106
00:06:56,525 --> 00:07:00,325
Speaker 4:  have a new series, you can put your little devices in every, every, everyone's

107
00:07:00,525 --> 00:07:03,765
Speaker 4:  nearby ISP and you could put it very close to them and have it preloaded.

108
00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:05,725
Speaker 4:  You can't do that with live. It just doesn't work.

109
00:07:06,155 --> 00:07:09,285
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And it, it's starting to make me wonder if it is

110
00:07:10,695 --> 00:07:14,585
Speaker 2:  technically speaking right now, just an unsolvable problem. 'cause like you

111
00:07:14,585 --> 00:07:18,465
Speaker 2:  said, I think If, you go rewind away, like Game of Thrones

112
00:07:18,525 --> 00:07:22,225
Speaker 2:  had streaming issues and there were a bunch of ways that these companies

113
00:07:22,635 --> 00:07:26,305
Speaker 2:  could and did solve them, right? And like you don't hear that

114
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:30,305
Speaker 2:  anymore from these sort of big event HBO

115
00:07:30,435 --> 00:07:34,425
Speaker 2:  style shows anymore. Like the, everybody logged onto HBO at

116
00:07:34,425 --> 00:07:37,585
Speaker 2:  nine o'clock on a Sunday night and couldn't watch their show. I have not

117
00:07:37,585 --> 00:07:40,825
Speaker 2:  heard that in years. We just fixed that. But

118
00:07:41,315 --> 00:07:44,545
Speaker 2:  there is something about trying to do this live and just literally like the

119
00:07:45,105 --> 00:07:48,985
Speaker 2:  physical infrastructure of making all of that happen that we're

120
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:52,545
Speaker 2:  very good at with linear television and they've been doing it for decades

121
00:07:52,645 --> 00:07:56,065
Speaker 2:  and they have trucks and it's a whole thing. And I, I'm starting to wonder

122
00:07:56,065 --> 00:07:59,895
Speaker 2:  if we just haven't developed the over the

123
00:08:00,055 --> 00:08:02,295
Speaker 2:  internet pieces of this in such a way that it's gonna work.

124
00:08:03,055 --> 00:08:05,715
Speaker 4:  I think the main issue is just that the internet wasn't made to work like

125
00:08:05,715 --> 00:08:08,795
Speaker 4:  that. And we're kind of tacking things on and we're make, creating these

126
00:08:08,795 --> 00:08:11,395
Speaker 4:  solutions to work around a problem that the internet was never designed to

127
00:08:11,395 --> 00:08:14,115
Speaker 4:  solve. Something that we talked about last year, but that still hasn't really

128
00:08:14,115 --> 00:08:17,515
Speaker 4:  arisen is L four s, which was supposed to help the latency issue so that

129
00:08:17,515 --> 00:08:20,835
Speaker 4:  when you send a packet and it really needs to get to, to someone on time,

130
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:23,995
Speaker 4:  that is the first one to get there. And there's so many other strategies

131
00:08:23,995 --> 00:08:27,435
Speaker 4:  that I think these companies have done to try and make sure that when people

132
00:08:27,435 --> 00:08:30,475
Speaker 4:  are streaming, it's not getting bogged down. It's not getting clogged at

133
00:08:30,475 --> 00:08:34,435
Speaker 4:  the various choke points, but it still does. You've got how many

134
00:08:34,435 --> 00:08:37,235
Speaker 4:  different devices you've got, how many different bit rates you've got, how

135
00:08:37,235 --> 00:08:40,795
Speaker 4:  many different encodings and DRM protection and all of these other things

136
00:08:40,985 --> 00:08:44,715
Speaker 4:  that you're putting on top of this that make it that much harder to stream

137
00:08:44,795 --> 00:08:48,115
Speaker 4:  a live event. And it's just not a problem that we solved yet. And I guess

138
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:51,395
Speaker 4:  on Christmas day, we're going to get another opportunity to see how close

139
00:08:51,395 --> 00:08:52,155
Speaker 4:  Netflix is.

140
00:08:52,385 --> 00:08:56,295
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Well I think I, I've been making fun of Netflix

141
00:08:56,515 --> 00:09:00,215
Speaker 2:  for like 48 hours now because they put out that statement on Saturday

142
00:09:00,565 --> 00:09:04,135
Speaker 2:  that was basically like, we think we did a great job

143
00:09:04,385 --> 00:09:08,175
Speaker 2:  after a whole evening and day of people online

144
00:09:08,265 --> 00:09:11,775
Speaker 2:  being like, this looks awful. I can't see anything.

145
00:09:12,005 --> 00:09:15,055
Speaker 2:  This is just like a 1980s pixelated

146
00:09:15,445 --> 00:09:18,495
Speaker 2:  monstrosity of a picture. Yeah. And then Netflix is like, you know what?

147
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:22,135
Speaker 2:  We did it. And I've kind of come around for all the reasons that you're saying.

148
00:09:22,155 --> 00:09:25,415
Speaker 2:  I'm like, honestly, maybe this is literally the best Netflix could have done.

149
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:29,175
Speaker 2:  And to some extent that might be more alarming as we think about where we're

150
00:09:29,175 --> 00:09:33,015
Speaker 2:  going. But maybe Netflix is not out of its

151
00:09:33,015 --> 00:09:35,975
Speaker 2:  mind to think it actually did this about as well as it could have.

152
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:40,975
Speaker 4:  I I can definitely see why they would have that perspective. What's

153
00:09:41,135 --> 00:09:43,735
Speaker 4:  interesting is like I'm hearing from people over, you know, I was watching

154
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:47,575
Speaker 4:  a stream of someone pointing their phone at the TV on TikTok

155
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:51,655
Speaker 4:  and live streaming it. 'cause the Netflix stream was 45 minutes behind, right?

156
00:09:52,115 --> 00:09:55,815
Speaker 4:  And so it's like, it can be done, you can get live video

157
00:09:55,885 --> 00:09:58,775
Speaker 4:  that people actually watch as long as, you know, 60 million people aren't

158
00:09:58,775 --> 00:10:00,655
Speaker 4:  tuning into this particular stream at the moment.

159
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:04,895
Speaker 2:  Yeah. There is a, there is a magic number at which it all kind of falls apart.

160
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:08,735
Speaker 2:  And I'm very curious, this is part of the reason I'm, I'm interested in

161
00:10:08,745 --> 00:10:12,215
Speaker 2:  these Christmas football games because Netflix has these two games on Christmas

162
00:10:12,435 --> 00:10:15,855
Speaker 2:  for the first time. They're both actually gonna be really good games. As

163
00:10:15,855 --> 00:10:19,535
Speaker 2:  it turns out, they're, they're like some of the best teams in the

164
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,095
Speaker 2:  NFL. It's gonna be very exciting. It's Christmas day. Lots of people are

165
00:10:22,095 --> 00:10:25,615
Speaker 2:  gonna watch, it seems unlikely that it's gonna be 60 million people

166
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,455
Speaker 2:  on either game. But like, let's say it's, let's say it's 30,

167
00:10:30,105 --> 00:10:34,055
Speaker 2:  we're gonna get such an interesting test case of at what

168
00:10:34,055 --> 00:10:37,175
Speaker 2:  point have we just hit the capacity of all of this infrastructure.

169
00:10:37,915 --> 00:10:41,695
Speaker 2:  And there's also just not that much time. Like Netflix can't fix the internet

170
00:10:41,695 --> 00:10:45,545
Speaker 2:  between now and Christmas Day. So to some extent, I assume there

171
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:48,985
Speaker 2:  will be lots of things it can learn, but it's not like it can rebuild its

172
00:10:48,985 --> 00:10:52,825
Speaker 2:  whole data delivery system between now and Christmas in order

173
00:10:52,825 --> 00:10:55,545
Speaker 2:  to get these football games. Right. So, I feel like we're gonna get a totally

174
00:10:55,545 --> 00:10:56,905
Speaker 2:  different but very similar test.

175
00:10:57,445 --> 00:11:00,545
Speaker 4:  And I, I think that's a big part of, it's just that you aren't dealing with

176
00:11:00,545 --> 00:11:03,745
Speaker 4:  just one problem or just one problem in just one place. You have many people

177
00:11:03,765 --> 00:11:07,585
Speaker 4:  in diff many different places. You have different issues. You have,

178
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:11,105
Speaker 4:  oh, the network's bad here or we don't have the, the backend

179
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:14,825
Speaker 4:  node connecting close enough to this many people who are all trying to stream

180
00:11:14,825 --> 00:11:18,025
Speaker 4:  it. You have different kinds of demand in different places. What if it's

181
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:21,625
Speaker 4:  good in most places, but it's not good in Baltimore. Like, Baltimore's playing

182
00:11:21,695 --> 00:11:25,585
Speaker 4:  away at this Texans game. And if it's just bad in one city,

183
00:11:25,695 --> 00:11:28,705
Speaker 4:  that is millions of people who are going to be very upset with Netflix.

184
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:33,585
Speaker 4:  Beyonce fans not always ready,

185
00:11:33,595 --> 00:11:37,025
Speaker 4:  ready If you are going to cause problems for them to watch. Their favorite

186
00:11:37,635 --> 00:11:40,825
Speaker 4:  could be an issue. We're gonna, we're gonna find out what happens. Yeah.

187
00:11:41,005 --> 00:11:44,225
Speaker 2:  So speaking of Beyonce, let's talk about this. 'cause the, the news on Monday

188
00:11:44,445 --> 00:11:48,385
Speaker 2:  was that Beyonce is going to be doing the halftime show at, at one of

189
00:11:48,385 --> 00:11:48,945
Speaker 2:  these games. Is that

190
00:11:48,945 --> 00:11:51,425
Speaker 4:  Right? Yes. It's the second game between the, the Ravens and the Texans.

191
00:11:51,425 --> 00:11:54,005
Speaker 4:  Okay. 'cause it's in Houston, she's from Houston. Natural synergy.

192
00:11:54,075 --> 00:11:57,125
Speaker 2:  That makes sense. But like, it's Beyonce, right? Like I would I would say

193
00:11:57,125 --> 00:12:01,005
Speaker 2:  in terms of like who you could announce as your halftime performer, that's

194
00:12:01,005 --> 00:12:04,925
Speaker 2:  about as big as it gets, right? Like that's, it's Beyonce. And so

195
00:12:04,945 --> 00:12:08,565
Speaker 2:  to me it's like, if you've ever wondered how serious Netflix is about doing

196
00:12:08,565 --> 00:12:12,205
Speaker 2:  this, Beyonce is the answer, right? Like this,

197
00:12:12,355 --> 00:12:15,965
Speaker 2:  this company is not kidding. And I think Jake Paul and Mike Tyson, you can

198
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:19,725
Speaker 2:  be like, oh, this is like slightly interesting, but also like

199
00:12:19,925 --> 00:12:23,765
Speaker 2:  slightly silliness. Two football games is like cool, but whatever. But

200
00:12:23,765 --> 00:12:26,285
Speaker 2:  like, it's, it's Beyonce, Richard, they got Beyonce.

201
00:12:26,655 --> 00:12:30,565
Speaker 4:  There are millions of people who will not miss that. Exactly. This is gonna

202
00:12:30,785 --> 00:12:33,805
Speaker 4:  be probably their first time to be able to see the songs off of her new album.

203
00:12:33,985 --> 00:12:37,125
Speaker 4:  It it just, there are a lot of things that are lining up. They are going

204
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:40,605
Speaker 4:  to be ready, they're going to be prepared for this and Netflix has to deliver.

205
00:12:40,715 --> 00:12:44,325
Speaker 2:  What do you make of this from Netflix? Netflix is clearly like all in now

206
00:12:44,385 --> 00:12:48,005
Speaker 2:  on sports after you and I have spent years on this show talking about how

207
00:12:48,005 --> 00:12:51,845
Speaker 2:  Netflix was very happy to not be in live sports. They did the Drive to

208
00:12:51,845 --> 00:12:55,645
Speaker 2:  Survive thing. They were like, we're gonna make the sort of ancillary content

209
00:12:55,785 --> 00:12:58,645
Speaker 2:  around games. We don't need to compete in this. Netflix has been saying this,

210
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:02,005
Speaker 2:  it feels like this company has done a total 180 and is now like we have to

211
00:13:02,005 --> 00:13:05,765
Speaker 2:  figure out how to do live and that means sports. Does this make sense to

212
00:13:05,765 --> 00:13:05,845
Speaker 2:  you?

213
00:13:06,425 --> 00:13:09,085
Speaker 4:  The thing I'm not sure about is how far they'll go into live, because I think

214
00:13:09,085 --> 00:13:12,205
Speaker 4:  that at least in one way it kind of serves them. How do we keep people from

215
00:13:12,205 --> 00:13:16,045
Speaker 4:  not canceling Netflix? And one of the answers is we have a huge event every

216
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,245
Speaker 4:  few months. So that every time you start thinking, man, you know what? I

217
00:13:18,245 --> 00:13:20,605
Speaker 4:  haven't watching Netflix in a while. Do I still need this subscription? Then

218
00:13:20,605 --> 00:13:23,085
Speaker 4:  Beyonce's on there and you're like, yep. Can't cancel yet. Fair.

219
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:26,885
Speaker 2:  That gives me Yeah, that's true. Like you need to basically have one of those

220
00:13:27,825 --> 00:13:31,805
Speaker 2:  at least announced every month so that I'm like, okay, well

221
00:13:31,805 --> 00:13:35,285
Speaker 2:  I'll keep it until then. And then like the day after Christmas, they're gonna

222
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:39,005
Speaker 2:  announce the next thing for February or whatever. And then that'll, that'll

223
00:13:39,005 --> 00:13:39,845
Speaker 2:  be that. We,

224
00:13:39,845 --> 00:13:43,605
Speaker 4:  We grew up with HBO and Showtime playing this game with boxing, with

225
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:47,525
Speaker 4:  music, with all of these things our entire lives growing up in the

226
00:13:47,685 --> 00:13:48,885
Speaker 4:  nineties, it's the same playbook.

227
00:13:49,305 --> 00:13:51,805
Speaker 2:  You know, what you just made me realize is they're definitely going to announce

228
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:56,045
Speaker 2:  the Stranger Things debut of some kind the

229
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:59,365
Speaker 2:  day after Christmas. And that's gonna, that's, that's how we get there for

230
00:13:59,365 --> 00:14:00,685
Speaker 2:  sure. Yeah. It,

231
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:03,005
Speaker 4:  It it just rolls in and on itself. Yeah,

232
00:14:03,005 --> 00:14:06,885
Speaker 2:  Exactly. Do you think Netflix has moves in sports here? Like is this, are

233
00:14:06,885 --> 00:14:09,365
Speaker 2:  you at all as a sports fan interested in what's coming here?

234
00:14:10,415 --> 00:14:14,395
Speaker 4:  Not really. I, I just, I, I wonder what,

235
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,875
Speaker 4:  what they can do, but they have enough money that it kind of doesn't matter

236
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:20,755
Speaker 4:  because they can get enough events. If they can sign up, say the NBA Cup

237
00:14:20,895 --> 00:14:24,155
Speaker 4:  or whoever, if if they have enough money, people will create events for them

238
00:14:24,175 --> 00:14:27,955
Speaker 4:  to host Jake Paul versus Mike Tyson. They said, how can we get

239
00:14:28,245 --> 00:14:32,235
Speaker 4:  Generation Z, generation X and millennials all to watch the same thing at

240
00:14:32,235 --> 00:14:35,555
Speaker 4:  the same time? Got it. And they'll just, they'll just find something else.

241
00:14:35,555 --> 00:14:38,355
Speaker 4:  They will, they will create something. They tried the hotdog competition.

242
00:14:38,355 --> 00:14:41,875
Speaker 4:  I don't think that really attracts all that much in attention. That seemed

243
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:45,355
Speaker 4:  to go off pretty well without Glitches. Their reality show was the first

244
00:14:45,355 --> 00:14:47,915
Speaker 4:  one that had huge problems. And I think they did the comedy thing that didn't

245
00:14:47,915 --> 00:14:51,845
Speaker 4:  work all that well. But you know, it's been kind of up and down. So it's

246
00:14:51,845 --> 00:14:54,165
Speaker 4:  hard to have these hits, but they're just gonna keep looking. They're gonna

247
00:14:54,165 --> 00:14:56,205
Speaker 4:  keep digging. They're, they've got the checkbook ready to spend

248
00:14:56,635 --> 00:15:00,165
Speaker 2:  Clearly. And I think the thing I've been trying to figure out is

249
00:15:00,475 --> 00:15:04,445
Speaker 2:  whether I want one of these streaming services to really

250
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:08,485
Speaker 2:  try and reinvent the wheel. Because I think, like you look at

251
00:15:08,505 --> 00:15:11,245
Speaker 2:  Amazon, which has been doing Thursday night football for a couple of years

252
00:15:11,305 --> 00:15:15,125
Speaker 2:  now. It just is football. Amazon has

253
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:19,045
Speaker 2:  like a couple of interesting stats ideas, but they're even

254
00:15:19,045 --> 00:15:22,485
Speaker 2:  like doing that in a sponsored way on other networks. Like that's just a

255
00:15:22,485 --> 00:15:26,125
Speaker 2:  whole separate thing. But it's like, it's, it's Al Michaels, it is like the

256
00:15:26,355 --> 00:15:30,045
Speaker 2:  most straightforward down the middle old school kind of

257
00:15:30,245 --> 00:15:34,165
Speaker 2:  football game. and we haven't seen a Netflix football game, but

258
00:15:34,205 --> 00:15:37,805
Speaker 2:  I would assume it's gonna be very much the same thing. Peacock is now

259
00:15:37,805 --> 00:15:40,885
Speaker 2:  streaming Sunday night football, but it's just taking a tv streaming and

260
00:15:40,885 --> 00:15:44,805
Speaker 2:  turning it into streaming. So part of me is like, somebody needs to take

261
00:15:44,805 --> 00:15:48,525
Speaker 2:  this and like blow up the whole concept of what it might be

262
00:15:48,665 --> 00:15:52,405
Speaker 2:  and give us new ways of looking at stuff and change the cameras and make

263
00:15:52,405 --> 00:15:55,845
Speaker 2:  it more interactive and whatever else. YouTube with Sunday ticket. Another

264
00:15:55,845 --> 00:15:59,045
Speaker 2:  example, like YouTube Sunday ticket is just Sunday ticket. It's just Sunday

265
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:02,845
Speaker 2:  ticket. It's just Sunday ticket. And that's fine, but it's part of me is

266
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:06,045
Speaker 2:  like, what's the next thing? And then the other part of me is like, well

267
00:16:06,045 --> 00:16:10,005
Speaker 2:  maybe let's spend our time making sure the thing works and then give it a

268
00:16:10,005 --> 00:16:13,245
Speaker 2:  few years and we will worry about actually putting this out there.

269
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:17,205
Speaker 4:  I think that that is the, the big question here. Because what I think what

270
00:16:17,205 --> 00:16:21,005
Speaker 4:  people want is not personalization. It is the same thing but better because

271
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:23,365
Speaker 4:  that's one thing that, that has been pushed out there. Oh, you'll be able

272
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:25,765
Speaker 4:  to get your personalized stream. You'll be able to get exactly what you want.

273
00:16:25,765 --> 00:16:29,165
Speaker 4:  Maybe you'll be able to tune into whatever camera you want. But what works

274
00:16:29,165 --> 00:16:32,285
Speaker 4:  better is when we're all watching the same thing at the same time. Like Paul

275
00:16:32,285 --> 00:16:35,885
Speaker 4:  versus Tyson, which creates a spectacle which creates a, I can't miss this

276
00:16:36,185 --> 00:16:40,005
Speaker 4:  and it's not personal, it's together and that is better. And you

277
00:16:40,005 --> 00:16:43,805
Speaker 4:  don't need like a fake auditorium of people. You just need an event that

278
00:16:43,805 --> 00:16:47,245
Speaker 4:  people want to watch. You don't need avatars, you don't need 3D you don't

279
00:16:47,245 --> 00:16:49,565
Speaker 4:  need any of those things. You don't even need a good fight.

280
00:16:49,835 --> 00:16:52,805
Speaker 2:  What you're saying is If, you had picked the other camera, you wouldn't have

281
00:16:52,805 --> 00:16:55,805
Speaker 2:  seen Mike Tyson's bare ass and that would've been a problem for you. It

282
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:58,365
Speaker 4:  Would If you could've all avoided that. It just, it would've been a choice

283
00:16:58,425 --> 00:17:01,485
Speaker 4:  if, if we had all been able to avoid that. But apparently that wasn't what

284
00:17:01,485 --> 00:17:05,165
Speaker 4:  the people voted for. 60 million people went the other way. So listen,

285
00:17:05,465 --> 00:17:06,005
Speaker 4:  we are wrong.

286
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:08,885
Speaker 2:  Netflix knows what people want. Richard, like let's be honest with each other.

287
00:17:09,235 --> 00:17:10,045
Speaker 2:  That was not, they

288
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:10,565
Speaker 4:  Have the analytics,

289
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:14,525
Speaker 2:  My conspiracy theory says that was completely deliberate. And and it is,

290
00:17:14,545 --> 00:17:18,445
Speaker 2:  it is just to juice views. You gotta get 'em how you can. Every we, this

291
00:17:18,445 --> 00:17:20,285
Speaker 2:  is the world we live in, Richard. It's fine.

292
00:17:21,325 --> 00:17:23,365
Speaker 4:  Next Virgin Cast is gonna be very interesting.

293
00:17:24,105 --> 00:17:26,365
Speaker 2:  Listen, it's, it's Q4. I'll do what I gotta do.

294
00:17:29,905 --> 00:17:32,965
Speaker 2:  So how are you feeling as a, as a streaming sports fan right now? This is

295
00:17:32,965 --> 00:17:34,965
Speaker 2:  like, this is a fun time to do this. 'cause we're, we're in the middle of

296
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:38,645
Speaker 2:  the NBA season. We're in the middle of the NFL season. The NNHL has started.

297
00:17:38,645 --> 00:17:41,805
Speaker 2:  College basketball is going college football is peaking. It's like, this

298
00:17:41,805 --> 00:17:44,885
Speaker 2:  is the best part of the year. If all you wanna watch is sports,

299
00:17:46,345 --> 00:17:50,005
Speaker 2:  and yet I feel like my sports watching life is

300
00:17:50,635 --> 00:17:54,565
Speaker 2:  more chaotic and more expensive than ever. I tried to watch the Bill's

301
00:17:54,565 --> 00:17:58,325
Speaker 2:  chiefs game on Sunday night and literally couldn't. I went through 10 services

302
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:02,165
Speaker 2:  and I was like, oh, I just don't have this game somehow. And I feel like

303
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:05,125
Speaker 2:  you feel my pain on this. As somebody who also likes to watch esoteric sports

304
00:18:05,235 --> 00:18:06,805
Speaker 2:  that you're not allowed to watch, that

305
00:18:06,805 --> 00:18:10,205
Speaker 4:  Is the greatest thing. Like, oh, oh, your, your team is playing. You pay

306
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:13,965
Speaker 4:  for maybe three packages already to watch this particular

307
00:18:13,965 --> 00:18:17,165
Speaker 4:  sport. And you find out, wait, I don't have the one that has this game still

308
00:18:17,165 --> 00:18:20,845
Speaker 4:  somehow I'm maybe better than last year because the local

309
00:18:21,165 --> 00:18:24,525
Speaker 4:  monopoly that controls Pistons streaming, they're still bad.

310
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:27,845
Speaker 4:  Still a monopoly. They're named after a different gambling company now. Sure.

311
00:18:28,145 --> 00:18:31,645
Speaker 4:  But at least it works. So when I give them my money to watch the Pistons,

312
00:18:31,805 --> 00:18:35,085
Speaker 4:  I can actually watch the game sometimes. And then I'm paying for League Pass

313
00:18:35,105 --> 00:18:38,525
Speaker 4:  So, I'm, and I'm paying for my local team subscription. But then if the game

314
00:18:38,525 --> 00:18:42,405
Speaker 4:  is on national TV, on ESPN, if, if I'm not paying for, you know, a, a

315
00:18:42,405 --> 00:18:46,285
Speaker 4:  cable package, can't get it or I can't get the good TNT

316
00:18:46,285 --> 00:18:49,885
Speaker 4:  stream, I can get the league past TNT stream, which, you know, with no announcers

317
00:18:49,885 --> 00:18:53,765
Speaker 4:  and whatnot. And it's just like, wait, how is this better than cable? Because

318
00:18:53,845 --> 00:18:57,285
Speaker 4:  I used to just have cable and it was like, okay, So I pay this much and I

319
00:18:57,285 --> 00:18:59,245
Speaker 4:  know that I'll be able to see the game. Maybe it'll be on a different channel

320
00:18:59,265 --> 00:19:02,405
Speaker 4:  or whatever, but I will be able to turn on my TV and the game will come in

321
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:05,725
Speaker 4:  and I don't have to log in and log out and have glitches and have the same

322
00:19:05,785 --> 00:19:06,765
Speaker 4:  ad three times a row.

323
00:19:07,115 --> 00:19:11,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I remember years ago having sort of the, the mental

324
00:19:11,145 --> 00:19:14,405
Speaker 2:  rubric of like, okay, if it's a good game, it's gonna be on this channel.

325
00:19:14,825 --> 00:19:17,845
Speaker 2:  If it's a nah game, it's gonna be on this channel. And if literally no one

326
00:19:17,845 --> 00:19:21,045
Speaker 2:  cares because both teams are trash, they'll just put it over here. And I

327
00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:24,045
Speaker 2:  knew the number of all of those channels and So I could find the game in

328
00:19:24,045 --> 00:19:27,485
Speaker 2:  30 seconds no matter what. And now it's literally like I went on, I went,

329
00:19:27,605 --> 00:19:31,045
Speaker 2:  I was on sling watching Red Zone because Sling still has Red Zone for reasons

330
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:34,965
Speaker 2:  I don't completely understand. I sling doesn't have CBS. So

331
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:38,005
Speaker 2:  when RedZone only got down to one game, I didn't have it there anymore. I

332
00:19:38,005 --> 00:19:38,485
Speaker 2:  went to,

333
00:19:40,205 --> 00:19:44,005
Speaker 2:  I went to YouTube tv, which had it, but my

334
00:19:44,005 --> 00:19:46,845
Speaker 2:  access had turned off because I forgot to pay it. That that one's probably

335
00:19:46,845 --> 00:19:50,325
Speaker 2:  on me. But then I went over to

336
00:19:50,535 --> 00:19:53,685
Speaker 2:  every streaming service I could think of being like, which one has CBS. And

337
00:19:53,685 --> 00:19:57,125
Speaker 2:  by the time I realized it was Paramount Plus, which sure, that's the one

338
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:01,045
Speaker 2:  with CBSI had, it was over and I had

339
00:20:01,045 --> 00:20:03,925
Speaker 2:  to go in and find my Paramount plus password because who uses Paramount Plus

340
00:20:04,225 --> 00:20:07,765
Speaker 2:  and it was just a hold and I was like, I will pay you just to watch the last

341
00:20:07,765 --> 00:20:11,485
Speaker 2:  five minutes of this game. I couldn't do it, wouldn't, wouldn't let me devastating.

342
00:20:11,985 --> 00:20:15,445
Speaker 4:  And, and as I said, back in the day, I just knew three channel numbers. That

343
00:20:15,445 --> 00:20:18,045
Speaker 4:  was all I needed to know. I didn't have to figure a whole bunch of things

344
00:20:18,045 --> 00:20:18,725
Speaker 4:  out. Yeah.

345
00:20:18,905 --> 00:20:21,525
Speaker 2:  Do you have any sense of whether this is gonna get better? You and I haven't

346
00:20:21,525 --> 00:20:25,005
Speaker 2:  talked about venue sports in a while. This supposed like

347
00:20:25,605 --> 00:20:27,485
Speaker 2:  smushing together of all these different companies rights.

348
00:20:27,835 --> 00:20:30,805
Speaker 4:  Well that depends on what happens on the, the courts if they ever actually

349
00:20:30,805 --> 00:20:33,605
Speaker 4:  get to launch or whatever they do or, and if it would be any good, if it

350
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:37,605
Speaker 4:  actually did exist, which will we ever find out?

351
00:20:37,985 --> 00:20:38,725
Speaker 4:  We do not know.

352
00:20:40,245 --> 00:20:43,735
Speaker 4:  Also, I think there's some interesting things going on because Amazon, for

353
00:20:43,735 --> 00:20:47,205
Speaker 4:  example, like with the NBAI think in 2025 could be very interesting because

354
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:51,085
Speaker 4:  Amazon is gonna have a lot of NBA games directly. They also own

355
00:20:51,165 --> 00:20:54,605
Speaker 4:  a share of the, whatever it's called now, FanDuel Sports

356
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:57,885
Speaker 4:  Networks that have some of these local broadcast rights. And in my area,

357
00:20:57,885 --> 00:21:00,645
Speaker 4:  oh, I didn't know that has the local broadcast rights. So maybe they can

358
00:21:00,645 --> 00:21:04,485
Speaker 4:  package it together. So, I can just use one app to watch most of

359
00:21:04,485 --> 00:21:08,325
Speaker 4:  the games. Unfortunately, the Pistons might be good and then they'll be on

360
00:21:08,485 --> 00:21:12,245
Speaker 4:  national TV and I'll have to pay even more to watch more games. So just problems

361
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:13,005
Speaker 4:  on top of problems.

362
00:21:13,035 --> 00:21:16,325
Speaker 2:  Well, at that point then you have to pay for ESPN's

363
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:22,325
Speaker 2:  multitude of streaming services. It's part of venue. It has ESPN plus is

364
00:21:22,325 --> 00:21:25,045
Speaker 2:  the, what's it called? Flagship, right? That's the thing that's supposed

365
00:21:25,045 --> 00:21:28,565
Speaker 2:  to just be ES, ESPN on the internet that's supposedly launching next year.

366
00:21:28,675 --> 00:21:32,485
Speaker 2:  Like in a funny way, we were having conversations

367
00:21:32,565 --> 00:21:35,925
Speaker 2:  a few years ago about how a bunch of really old

368
00:21:36,225 --> 00:21:39,325
Speaker 2:  rights deals were slowing everything down, right? 'cause they had all been

369
00:21:39,325 --> 00:21:42,805
Speaker 2:  signed a decade ago. They were, they were really focused on

370
00:21:42,805 --> 00:21:46,285
Speaker 2:  broadcast TV in particular. And so the idea that this stuff could be

371
00:21:46,525 --> 00:21:50,125
Speaker 2:  streamed and available widely didn't really exist. Now it feels like basically

372
00:21:50,305 --> 00:21:53,885
Speaker 2:  all of those deals have turned over. I think the NBA is probably the last

373
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:58,005
Speaker 2:  one to turn over. Yeah. And that starts next year. Big streaming

374
00:21:58,015 --> 00:22:01,445
Speaker 2:  shift. Like you said, Amazon's a big player now a lot of stuff is moving

375
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:05,125
Speaker 2:  to ESPN, which is doing a lot of streaming stuff. And now it feels like the

376
00:22:05,185 --> 00:22:09,005
Speaker 2:  holdup is the platforms which can't figure out how to launch. They

377
00:22:09,005 --> 00:22:11,405
Speaker 2:  can't figure out what they're supposed to charge. They can't figure out how

378
00:22:11,405 --> 00:22:15,365
Speaker 2:  to serve this stuff to this many people. Like we should be in a moment

379
00:22:15,495 --> 00:22:19,405
Speaker 2:  where some streamer is like, we are going to exclusively stream the

380
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:22,485
Speaker 2:  Super Bowl and it's gonna be fine. Netflix should be able to do that. There

381
00:22:22,485 --> 00:22:25,285
Speaker 2:  are more people in America who have Netflix than anything else.

382
00:22:26,195 --> 00:22:30,115
Speaker 2:  Like this should be possible. And yet it isn't. And everyone knows

383
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:33,395
Speaker 2:  it's not possible. So we're in a, we're in a weird moment now where the problem

384
00:22:33,415 --> 00:22:36,955
Speaker 2:  we used to have is no longer the problem. And it's making very obvious this

385
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:39,595
Speaker 2:  new problem that we have, which is that none of the platforms are ready for

386
00:22:39,595 --> 00:22:39,715
Speaker 2:  this.

387
00:22:40,635 --> 00:22:44,335
Speaker 4:  It turns out that the problem is money and certain companies have lots of

388
00:22:44,335 --> 00:22:46,815
Speaker 4:  it and they're willing to spend it. So the leagues are gonna chase it in

389
00:22:46,815 --> 00:22:50,655
Speaker 4:  however they, they can. And what the leagues have found is that playing the

390
00:22:50,655 --> 00:22:53,735
Speaker 4:  networks off of each other or now the platforms off of each other and the

391
00:22:53,735 --> 00:22:57,655
Speaker 4:  networks and the various intermingling of those is the way to

392
00:22:57,655 --> 00:23:01,575
Speaker 4:  get the highest bids to make the most money. And so now we're in

393
00:23:01,575 --> 00:23:05,295
Speaker 4:  for another 10 years or so of, of switching and swapping between

394
00:23:05,295 --> 00:23:05,575
Speaker 4:  apps.

395
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:09,775
Speaker 2:  I really hate how aggressively I'm starting to root for Amazon

396
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:13,615
Speaker 2:  because I, I think you're right that Amazon has this big idea of being

397
00:23:14,445 --> 00:23:17,695
Speaker 2:  like the one that puts it all together. And

398
00:23:18,455 --> 00:23:22,255
Speaker 2:  I think in theory, ESPN wants to be that and is doing

399
00:23:22,255 --> 00:23:26,095
Speaker 2:  some interesting stuff along those lines, but Disney just doesn't have the

400
00:23:26,095 --> 00:23:30,015
Speaker 2:  money to do that. But basically like the companies that could just

401
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:33,855
Speaker 2:  buy all the sports rights, it's just kind of Amazon and Apple. And

402
00:23:33,855 --> 00:23:37,815
Speaker 2:  Apple, I don't think is, is interested in playing that particular sports

403
00:23:37,845 --> 00:23:41,635
Speaker 2:  game, but Amazon like

404
00:23:41,695 --> 00:23:45,045
Speaker 2:  it, it could get as much as it wants, right? Like it can afford all of of

405
00:23:45,045 --> 00:23:46,165
Speaker 2:  it. And so they have

406
00:23:46,165 --> 00:23:49,325
Speaker 4:  The scale, they also have the scale to deliver. Yeah. As bad as their apps

407
00:23:49,325 --> 00:23:53,085
Speaker 4:  tend to be, they can actually deliver a live stream. And AWS does exist.

408
00:23:53,085 --> 00:23:53,365
Speaker 4:  Yeah,

409
00:23:53,525 --> 00:23:57,445
Speaker 2:  Thursday night football works. It's not as big as these. Like I would be

410
00:23:57,445 --> 00:24:01,205
Speaker 2:  interested to see 60 million people try to watch Prime video, right? Like,

411
00:24:01,205 --> 00:24:04,405
Speaker 2:  again, it's, there is a, there is a matter of scale that we just haven't

412
00:24:04,405 --> 00:24:08,245
Speaker 2:  seen on streaming work anywhere yet. But,

413
00:24:08,385 --> 00:24:12,325
Speaker 2:  but yeah, I feel like if if someone were going to give us the dream

414
00:24:12,475 --> 00:24:16,325
Speaker 2:  back, it's probably gonna be Amazon, which I makes, I hate saying

415
00:24:16,325 --> 00:24:19,325
Speaker 2:  that out loud. Even just that, that felt bad, that I'm like, gosh, I hope

416
00:24:19,385 --> 00:24:21,965
Speaker 2:  Amazon wins TV because that would be terrific.

417
00:24:23,245 --> 00:24:24,305
Speaker 3:  But it kind of feels like it.

418
00:24:24,485 --> 00:24:27,505
Speaker 4:  That's how dark the future has gotten. We're looking at Amazon and saying,

419
00:24:27,505 --> 00:24:27,945
Speaker 4:  save us.

420
00:24:29,205 --> 00:24:31,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Andy Jasi, it's all up to you.

421
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:37,125
Speaker 2:  Oh, brother. So what, what have you seen this year that gives you hope?

422
00:24:37,135 --> 00:24:39,885
Speaker 2:  Let's end on a high note here. I wanna just say, we haven't talked about

423
00:24:39,885 --> 00:24:43,605
Speaker 2:  this on the show in a long time. I thought peacock crushed the Olympics when

424
00:24:43,605 --> 00:24:47,045
Speaker 2:  it comes to sports streaming. The thing that I was like, okay, internet sports

425
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:50,815
Speaker 2:  TV is gonna be cool, was Peacock in the Olympics,

426
00:24:50,995 --> 00:24:54,295
Speaker 2:  all the sports, all the different ways to navigate. They had the gold zone

427
00:24:54,295 --> 00:24:58,255
Speaker 2:  thing, they had the primetime thing. Like that was great. And I

428
00:24:58,255 --> 00:25:01,535
Speaker 2:  don't know how replicable that is for other sports, but like, I, that to

429
00:25:01,535 --> 00:25:04,095
Speaker 2:  me was when it was like, okay, the streaming era of sports might be great.

430
00:25:04,905 --> 00:25:08,325
Speaker 4:  It was there, it worked. The streams were consistent, the quality was high.

431
00:25:08,485 --> 00:25:11,245
Speaker 4:  I didn't feel like I was way behind. I didn't have to feel, I didn't feel

432
00:25:11,245 --> 00:25:14,805
Speaker 4:  like I, I had to watch a bunch of things that I didn't want to. It it,

433
00:25:15,365 --> 00:25:18,165
Speaker 4:  I, I, I got a lot that I wanted there. There were some things that could've

434
00:25:18,165 --> 00:25:20,645
Speaker 4:  been better. I felt like, you know, when you were navigating through like

435
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:23,165
Speaker 4:  archive defense, when you wanted to watch something that already aired, it

436
00:25:23,165 --> 00:25:26,525
Speaker 4:  was harder than it needed to be. Yes. But I felt like they also made some

437
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,765
Speaker 4:  concessions perhaps to, to make the viewing experience a little bit better.

438
00:25:30,355 --> 00:25:33,805
Speaker 4:  Like If, you If you jumped out of something and you jumped back in all. Okay,

439
00:25:33,805 --> 00:25:37,405
Speaker 4:  so the ad doesn't play just again, the way that we've seen in previous years

440
00:25:37,585 --> 00:25:41,475
Speaker 4:  and on other platforms. Yeah, and I

441
00:25:41,475 --> 00:25:44,635
Speaker 4:  think there's some push and pull because I understand, hey, this platform

442
00:25:44,685 --> 00:25:48,595
Speaker 4:  needs to make money from this event. Got it. But I just want

443
00:25:48,595 --> 00:25:51,955
Speaker 4:  to watch it. I paid for it. Yeah, I would like to watch it. Give me that.

444
00:25:51,975 --> 00:25:55,755
Speaker 4:  And, and they kind of, they kind of crossed that bar and that's where

445
00:25:56,115 --> 00:25:58,035
Speaker 4:  everyone else should be aiming at. At the minimum,

446
00:25:58,655 --> 00:26:01,755
Speaker 2:  You're a simple man with simple needs. Richard, just show me the thing that

447
00:26:01,795 --> 00:26:02,715
Speaker 2:  I have clicked on, please.

448
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:03,715
Speaker 3:  Yes.

449
00:26:04,745 --> 00:26:06,755
Speaker 2:  Fair enough. All right, Richard, thank you as always.

450
00:26:07,325 --> 00:26:07,755
Speaker 4:  Thank you.

451
00:26:09,175 --> 00:26:11,635
Speaker 2:  All right, we gotta take a break and then we're gonna come back and we're

452
00:26:11,635 --> 00:26:13,795
Speaker 2:  gonna talk about notebooks. We'll be right back.

453
00:27:28,235 --> 00:27:31,805
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. So a few weeks ago I started reading this book called The

454
00:27:32,045 --> 00:27:35,965
Speaker 2:  Notebook A History of Thinking on Paper by a guy named Roland Allen. And

455
00:27:35,965 --> 00:27:39,725
Speaker 2:  it traces like a thousand years of history

456
00:27:40,185 --> 00:27:44,165
Speaker 2:  of how people write on paper. He makes this

457
00:27:44,185 --> 00:27:47,485
Speaker 2:  big case, that paper is this incredibly

458
00:27:48,245 --> 00:27:51,845
Speaker 2:  critical invention in the history of the world. And that actually

459
00:27:51,845 --> 00:27:55,605
Speaker 2:  without paper, without notebooks, we wouldn't have modern capitalism.

460
00:27:55,745 --> 00:27:59,605
Speaker 2:  We wouldn't know nearly as much about history as we do that actually

461
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:03,285
Speaker 2:  a lot of the world that we live in is defined by

462
00:28:03,665 --> 00:28:07,565
Speaker 2:  the way that people wrote stuff down and what they wrote stuff down on. He

463
00:28:07,565 --> 00:28:11,085
Speaker 2:  tells a whole history of notebooks all the way through the

464
00:28:11,085 --> 00:28:14,365
Speaker 2:  Renaissance and all the way up to now. And even in the future,

465
00:28:15,345 --> 00:28:19,165
Speaker 2:  If, you listen to the show, you know that I love note taking apps. I love

466
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:22,725
Speaker 2:  thinking about how people write stuff down. I think the systems for all this

467
00:28:22,725 --> 00:28:26,565
Speaker 2:  are fascinating. And this book was like catnip for me. So I asked Roland

468
00:28:26,565 --> 00:28:29,965
Speaker 2:  to come on the show and talk through some of the big ideas in his book, and

469
00:28:29,965 --> 00:28:33,925
Speaker 2:  also why notebooks continue to survive in

470
00:28:34,165 --> 00:28:38,005
Speaker 2:  this increasingly digital world. It's a super fun conversation. I

471
00:28:38,005 --> 00:28:41,125
Speaker 2:  really enjoyed talking to him. And yes, there is more

472
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:46,245
Speaker 2:  12 century history in this episode than most, but we're

473
00:28:46,245 --> 00:28:49,885
Speaker 2:  gonna go with it. So to start with Roland, I asked him to quickly

474
00:28:50,255 --> 00:28:53,325
Speaker 2:  recap the case that he makes that paper

475
00:28:54,105 --> 00:28:57,845
Speaker 2:  is a hugely important invention in the history of the world. And that

476
00:28:57,845 --> 00:29:01,805
Speaker 2:  without paper we might not have any of this. Here's what he said

477
00:29:01,805 --> 00:29:02,045
Speaker 2:  to that.

478
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:05,225
Speaker 5:  Yeah, permanence is really why

479
00:29:06,965 --> 00:29:10,305
Speaker 5:  for thousands of years we've had different ways of writing things down as

480
00:29:10,305 --> 00:29:14,225
Speaker 5:  human beings. So you go back to, you can, you can carve on stone, you can

481
00:29:14,775 --> 00:29:18,665
Speaker 5:  make little dents in clay tablets, which you then fire and dry out and they're

482
00:29:18,825 --> 00:29:22,665
Speaker 5:  permanent, but they are clay tablets, so they're not super portable or practical

483
00:29:23,085 --> 00:29:26,905
Speaker 5:  or robust. Then you have papyrus, papyrus,

484
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:30,625
Speaker 5:  the reed product, which grows in Egypt.

485
00:29:31,485 --> 00:29:35,265
Speaker 5:  And you can write on that, you can draw on that. But papyrus, it turns

486
00:29:35,285 --> 00:29:39,225
Speaker 5:  out, unless it's actually an in an Egyptian tomb, completely

487
00:29:39,485 --> 00:29:43,045
Speaker 5:  dry with no movement and nothing to disturb it, it will just

488
00:29:43,045 --> 00:29:46,685
Speaker 5:  automatically fall apart. It it, it can't cope with any kind of damp or

489
00:29:46,825 --> 00:29:50,725
Speaker 5:  it can't really cope with being handled. So papyrus is handy, but

490
00:29:50,725 --> 00:29:54,445
Speaker 5:  it's not permanent. And then you have wax tablets and

491
00:29:54,495 --> 00:29:57,645
Speaker 5:  these are beautiful things. They're amazing. Completely died out in Europe.

492
00:29:58,185 --> 00:30:01,525
Speaker 5:  But for about 2000 years, this is how Europeans

493
00:30:02,605 --> 00:30:06,205
Speaker 5:  retained information, took notes, wrote poems,

494
00:30:07,425 --> 00:30:11,285
Speaker 5:  agreed contracts, bills of sale, whatever, with a layer of wax

495
00:30:11,705 --> 00:30:14,965
Speaker 5:  on wood, which you would then scrape into with a little stylus.

496
00:30:15,745 --> 00:30:19,445
Speaker 5:  Now obviously that's not permanent, so it's very useful for

497
00:30:19,455 --> 00:30:22,885
Speaker 5:  being in a poet's notebook, for instance, because you can wipe it over at

498
00:30:22,885 --> 00:30:26,805
Speaker 5:  the end of the day when you're finished writing your poem. But for a business

499
00:30:26,805 --> 00:30:30,645
Speaker 5:  record, it's no good at all because you know, you, you have to

500
00:30:30,645 --> 00:30:34,525
Speaker 5:  know what you agreed, what you contracted. Then you have

501
00:30:34,595 --> 00:30:38,565
Speaker 5:  parchment, and parchment comes along a little bit later during the period

502
00:30:38,565 --> 00:30:42,365
Speaker 5:  of the Roman Empire probably. And that's a really good writing

503
00:30:42,685 --> 00:30:45,845
Speaker 5:  material. It's very tough, it's completely indestructible and

504
00:30:46,705 --> 00:30:49,725
Speaker 5:  you can write on it beautifully. And you can also paint on it If you like.

505
00:30:49,865 --> 00:30:53,365
Speaker 5:  So the illuminated manuscripts, which we see the book of Kas and so on,

506
00:30:53,575 --> 00:30:56,845
Speaker 5:  these are all on parchment and they're very beautiful. But the problem is

507
00:30:56,845 --> 00:31:00,325
Speaker 5:  when you write on parchment with a pen, the ink

508
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:03,925
Speaker 5:  sits on the surface and dries, which means you can scrape it off.

509
00:31:04,335 --> 00:31:07,765
Speaker 5:  Which means that, again, it's not permanent, you can change it, you can affect

510
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:11,445
Speaker 5:  the record. So it's no good for business. Paper turns up in Europe around

511
00:31:11,465 --> 00:31:15,365
Speaker 5:  the year 12 40, 12 50. And very quickly a

512
00:31:15,365 --> 00:31:19,245
Speaker 5:  few people realize it's a game changer because anything which is

513
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:23,005
Speaker 5:  written on paper, stay with ink stays there. So

514
00:31:23,145 --> 00:31:26,805
Speaker 5:  you can have a contract, you can keep a business record, you can

515
00:31:27,105 --> 00:31:30,125
Speaker 5:  do anything legal, you can have a deed, for instance, and you don't have

516
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:34,005
Speaker 5:  to worry about it being forged. Yeah. And that's

517
00:31:34,005 --> 00:31:37,965
Speaker 5:  important. So paper is really important because it's permanent and that leads

518
00:31:37,985 --> 00:31:41,725
Speaker 5:  to its very, very rapid adoption in

519
00:31:41,865 --> 00:31:43,685
Speaker 5:  the business community in particular.

520
00:31:44,585 --> 00:31:47,045
Speaker 2:  Was that where it started? I was, I was trying to match some of the timelines

521
00:31:47,065 --> 00:31:50,845
Speaker 2:  and going back through, it seems like I,

522
00:31:50,865 --> 00:31:54,525
Speaker 2:  if I have the timeline correct, there were, there were two

523
00:31:54,595 --> 00:31:58,045
Speaker 2:  threads. There was kind of the people who use it for business and people

524
00:31:58,465 --> 00:32:02,405
Speaker 2:  who use it for recording things in their own personal lives. But

525
00:32:02,405 --> 00:32:05,925
Speaker 2:  it does seem like business became a real use case for

526
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:07,125
Speaker 2:  notebooks first.

527
00:32:07,915 --> 00:32:11,765
Speaker 5:  Yeah, absolutely. A hundred percent. And the analogy, which you can

528
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:15,725
Speaker 5:  very easily draw is with the modern computer. Mm. You know, that

529
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:19,605
Speaker 5:  comes from IBM and it's businesses and governments which

530
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:23,085
Speaker 5:  have it to begin with for the first how long? 30 years, maybe 40 years.

531
00:32:23,905 --> 00:32:27,365
Speaker 5:  And then you get people using it creatively. And then you get people like

532
00:32:27,365 --> 00:32:30,405
Speaker 5:  jobs thinking, oh, you can have some fun with this thing. You know, you can

533
00:32:30,405 --> 00:32:33,965
Speaker 5:  play games on it, but you can also be seriously creative. So now you have

534
00:32:34,415 --> 00:32:38,245
Speaker 5:  Pixar, for instance. And I don't think anyone at IBM in the 1940s was

535
00:32:38,245 --> 00:32:42,005
Speaker 5:  thinking that Pixar was gonna happen. Right? Looking back, it seems inevitable

536
00:32:42,755 --> 00:32:46,325
Speaker 5:  that people would do something like that. And it's exactly the same kind

537
00:32:46,325 --> 00:32:48,085
Speaker 5:  of relationship with notebooks. You have

538
00:32:49,595 --> 00:32:52,875
Speaker 5:  businesses come to rely on notebooks, utterly, they use them for everything.

539
00:32:53,695 --> 00:32:54,835
Speaker 5:  And therefore

540
00:32:56,355 --> 00:32:59,875
Speaker 5:  notebooks get into everyone's hands, particularly in a culture like Italy,

541
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:03,155
Speaker 5:  which at the time Italy's the richest part of Europe. But it's also where

542
00:33:03,155 --> 00:33:05,755
Speaker 5:  they invent banking, where they invent companies, where they invent

543
00:33:06,545 --> 00:33:10,155
Speaker 5:  accountancy, double entry, bookkeeping, limited liability, partnerships,

544
00:33:10,425 --> 00:33:13,915
Speaker 5:  futures, markets, all of these things which we know and love.

545
00:33:14,415 --> 00:33:17,875
Speaker 2:  And, and a lot of that you talk about happens,

546
00:33:18,575 --> 00:33:22,515
Speaker 2:  not sort of, it, it, that doesn't happen. And then they put it down in notebooks,

547
00:33:22,515 --> 00:33:26,395
Speaker 2:  like the existence of those things and notebooks and this new

548
00:33:26,395 --> 00:33:29,435
Speaker 2:  writing, permanent technology go hand in hand.

549
00:33:30,115 --> 00:33:33,675
Speaker 5:  Absolutely. You can't do one without the other. But then of course, so

550
00:33:33,905 --> 00:33:37,555
Speaker 5:  they have to have these notebooks, and once they have to have them in the

551
00:33:37,555 --> 00:33:40,475
Speaker 5:  evening, they take 'em home and then, then they do the fun stuff with them.

552
00:33:40,735 --> 00:33:44,635
Speaker 5:  And that's entirely accidental, I think. But,

553
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:47,635
Speaker 5:  you know, thank God from our point of view, it's given us all of this interesting

554
00:33:47,795 --> 00:33:49,235
Speaker 5:  literature and art and poetry.

555
00:33:49,705 --> 00:33:53,595
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So, I confess. I'm particularly interested in the fun stuff. So

556
00:33:53,595 --> 00:33:56,395
Speaker 2:  let, let's start there. I think the, the first thing I had written down in

557
00:33:56,395 --> 00:34:00,315
Speaker 2:  my notes was like, let's go back to Florence and, and there's

558
00:34:00,315 --> 00:34:04,275
Speaker 2:  a word that starts with a Z that I can't pronounce. And it was, it

559
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:08,115
Speaker 2:  was, it, my, my gut tells me it's pronounced zibo, but I could be wrong.

560
00:34:08,795 --> 00:34:08,915
Speaker 2:  I

561
00:34:08,935 --> 00:34:12,835
Speaker 5:  You are dead, right? Yeah. Yes. I I you just have to imagine yourself ordering

562
00:34:12,835 --> 00:34:15,595
Speaker 5:  a zzi baldon an Italian restaurant and you'll be fine. Right.

563
00:34:15,835 --> 00:34:19,115
Speaker 2:  A, a type of notebook and also a beautiful croissant like thing

564
00:34:19,795 --> 00:34:23,555
Speaker 2:  that I will like very much. Tell me what those were. Talk a little bit about,

565
00:34:23,555 --> 00:34:24,755
Speaker 2:  well, kind of how that spread.

566
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:28,995
Speaker 5:  Okay, back to the restaurant Z baldon seems to have been a word for salad

567
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:33,475
Speaker 5:  and that's exactly what it is. So it's a collection of lots of

568
00:34:33,475 --> 00:34:37,235
Speaker 5:  different things jumbled together. Now, this is a time

569
00:34:37,235 --> 00:34:40,515
Speaker 5:  before print, we're talking about about 1300 and it's Florence

570
00:34:41,055 --> 00:34:44,995
Speaker 5:  and it's a time before print. So If, you wanted to have any book or literature

571
00:34:45,015 --> 00:34:48,875
Speaker 5:  or poetry in your house. You had to basically write it

572
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:51,835
Speaker 5:  down yourself. Yeah. And therefore,

573
00:34:53,315 --> 00:34:56,275
Speaker 5:  Florence is a very business-like community. They're very entrepreneurial.

574
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:59,315
Speaker 5:  Everyone's got their own little business, therefore everyone's got their

575
00:34:59,795 --> 00:35:03,715
Speaker 5:  business notebooks. They take 'em home in the evening and if they hear

576
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:07,755
Speaker 5:  a poem which they like, or if they hear is one of ESOP's fables

577
00:35:07,755 --> 00:35:11,435
Speaker 5:  is very popular, or a bit of ovid or a prayer, which is particularly

578
00:35:11,715 --> 00:35:15,195
Speaker 5:  resonant to them, or a recipe, very often they're writing down medic

579
00:35:15,265 --> 00:35:19,075
Speaker 5:  medicinal cures. Anything you wanna keep written down in your house, you

580
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:22,475
Speaker 5:  just write it down in your al And it's a very personal notebook, but it's

581
00:35:22,475 --> 00:35:25,515
Speaker 5:  completely unsorted. So it's like a salad in this jumbled up way.

582
00:35:26,735 --> 00:35:29,795
Speaker 5:  And they're brilliant because they're these windows

583
00:35:30,505 --> 00:35:34,355
Speaker 5:  into what Florentine people loved. Yeah. So we

584
00:35:34,355 --> 00:35:37,965
Speaker 5:  know the poetry, they like to read, we know the prayers that they wanted

585
00:35:37,965 --> 00:35:41,045
Speaker 5:  to remember. We know the stories that they liked to tell and we know what

586
00:35:41,045 --> 00:35:44,165
Speaker 5:  they liked to eat when they had a headache. You know, all of this kind of

587
00:35:44,165 --> 00:35:48,045
Speaker 5:  information because everyone in Florence at this time who could read or

588
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:52,025
Speaker 5:  write, which was most of them unusually, they kept a al

589
00:35:52,605 --> 00:35:55,825
Speaker 5:  and it was a really strange local thing. But it was so fun.

590
00:35:56,505 --> 00:35:59,425
Speaker 2:  I also get the sense that folks back then were reckoning with the same thing

591
00:35:59,425 --> 00:36:02,425
Speaker 2:  people reckon with now, which is like, what do I do with any of this? And

592
00:36:02,735 --> 00:36:06,705
Speaker 2:  this is sort of the eternal question of notebooks, right? Is you, you

593
00:36:06,705 --> 00:36:09,945
Speaker 2:  write a bunch of stuff down, you collect all this stuff. And as a historical

594
00:36:09,945 --> 00:36:13,185
Speaker 2:  artifact, especially in aggregate, it's very cool, right? You, you get a

595
00:36:13,185 --> 00:36:17,145
Speaker 2:  sense of what people were doing in a, in a community. But if

596
00:36:17,205 --> 00:36:20,545
Speaker 2:  I'm a person in Florence in the 13 hundreds keeping one of these,

597
00:36:22,095 --> 00:36:25,145
Speaker 2:  what do, what am I doing with it day to day? What's gonna happen to these

598
00:36:25,345 --> 00:36:28,665
Speaker 2:  notebooks? Are they thinking about like the grand sweep of history and their

599
00:36:28,665 --> 00:36:31,145
Speaker 2:  responsibility to write this stuff down? Like what were the, what was the

600
00:36:31,145 --> 00:36:32,225
Speaker 2:  point of these notebooks?

601
00:36:33,045 --> 00:36:36,905
Speaker 5:  So the ziel only the, the only point was fun. They weren't thinking about

602
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:40,225
Speaker 5:  the grand sweep of history, but they knew that they were a bit precious because

603
00:36:40,335 --> 00:36:43,625
Speaker 5:  they would leave them in their wills. So this is how we know, one of the

604
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:47,105
Speaker 5:  ways we know how many people had them, because the wills often survive.

605
00:36:47,965 --> 00:36:51,945
Speaker 5:  And also you see these little dedications in the, someone will start

606
00:36:51,945 --> 00:36:55,465
Speaker 5:  their zil donni, then they'll leave it to their son and then the son will

607
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:58,785
Speaker 5:  have an argument on the pages of the Zil donni with his brother saying, oh

608
00:36:58,805 --> 00:37:02,425
Speaker 5:  no, he dad left it to me actually. You know? So you have these little

609
00:37:02,425 --> 00:37:06,025
Speaker 5:  bickerings and you can see that sometimes they pass down three generations

610
00:37:06,025 --> 00:37:08,825
Speaker 5:  and that people maintain them 'cause the handwriting changes.

611
00:37:10,445 --> 00:37:14,265
Speaker 5:  So that's one thing. So Zi donia, they're always for fun, but

612
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:17,145
Speaker 5:  people definitely keep know that they have a value.

613
00:37:18,165 --> 00:37:22,025
Speaker 5:  The other thing that they also start doing is viewing their family as

614
00:37:22,065 --> 00:37:25,585
Speaker 5:  a kind of business and then keeping what they would call a libre de familia.

615
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:30,505
Speaker 5:  Oh, well za is the other word for it. Where they keep a family

616
00:37:30,505 --> 00:37:33,585
Speaker 5:  record, which is essentially births, deaths, marriages,

617
00:37:34,055 --> 00:37:37,345
Speaker 5:  investments, you know, we bought this house, I invested in this company,

618
00:37:37,845 --> 00:37:41,385
Speaker 5:  my daughter got married, my son died, my grandson was born, he was

619
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:45,545
Speaker 5:  baptized, et cetera. And they're very businesslike. You wouldn't

620
00:37:45,545 --> 00:37:49,505
Speaker 5:  call them diaries because there's no emotion in there. There's no

621
00:37:49,695 --> 00:37:53,305
Speaker 5:  happiness or sadness. But they just record the central

622
00:37:53,525 --> 00:37:56,865
Speaker 5:  of most important events of a family's life. And then that would get passed

623
00:37:56,865 --> 00:38:00,665
Speaker 5:  down through the generations as well. And that, but that's more viewing your

624
00:38:00,665 --> 00:38:04,625
Speaker 5:  family in a kind of quite serious business-like way If, you are a

625
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:08,545
Speaker 5:  grammar school in the, say 15

626
00:38:08,545 --> 00:38:12,425
Speaker 5:  hundreds. 16 hundreds in Europe. You were expected to

627
00:38:12,425 --> 00:38:16,065
Speaker 5:  keep a commonplace book in a very rigorous way. And that was a very formal

628
00:38:16,215 --> 00:38:19,505
Speaker 5:  kind of thing. But that was educational, you know, that wasn't, no one ever

629
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:23,185
Speaker 5:  really did that for fun. 'cause it's such hard work. Yeah. It's a, it's a

630
00:38:23,185 --> 00:38:27,065
Speaker 5:  real effort and it's study. But I think that outside of school

631
00:38:27,165 --> 00:38:31,145
Speaker 5:  you have people like Leonardo who would just draw all over the

632
00:38:31,145 --> 00:38:34,585
Speaker 5:  place. You have people who doodle. You have people who write very intimate

633
00:38:34,865 --> 00:38:37,885
Speaker 5:  personal diaries, people who write very formal ones, people who write about

634
00:38:37,885 --> 00:38:41,605
Speaker 5:  their relationship with God. You know, there's no hard and fast

635
00:38:41,605 --> 00:38:41,925
Speaker 5:  rules.

636
00:38:43,105 --> 00:38:46,755
Speaker 2:  Okay. And that feels like the, the thing that

637
00:38:47,465 --> 00:38:50,675
Speaker 2:  lingers most over time is that everybody is perpetually finding new ways

638
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:54,635
Speaker 2:  to fill up a notebook. Yeah. Kind of more chaotic

639
00:38:55,105 --> 00:38:59,075
Speaker 2:  over time too. Everybody gets weirder and weirder about notebooks.

640
00:38:59,975 --> 00:39:02,915
Speaker 2:  Da Vinci is an interesting one. You, you mentioned him and obviously I would

641
00:39:02,915 --> 00:39:06,875
Speaker 2:  say, you've obviously done more research on this than I have, but I would

642
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:10,315
Speaker 2:  say Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks probably history's most famous

643
00:39:10,635 --> 00:39:11,675
Speaker 2:  notebooks, fair to say.

644
00:39:12,385 --> 00:39:15,755
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I would say so. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Those are the ones when I was telling

645
00:39:15,755 --> 00:39:18,475
Speaker 5:  people that I was writing history of Notebook and they were looking baffled,

646
00:39:18,515 --> 00:39:20,755
Speaker 5:  I would go, you know, Leonardo. Yeah. Right.

647
00:39:21,705 --> 00:39:24,995
Speaker 2:  Well, one thing I thought was really interesting in, in your telling of his

648
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:25,835
Speaker 2:  story was that he

649
00:39:27,495 --> 00:39:31,195
Speaker 2:  did not seem to imagine that his notebooks would eventually become wildly

650
00:39:31,195 --> 00:39:34,915
Speaker 2:  famous. And the idea that these were for public consumption

651
00:39:36,445 --> 00:39:39,705
Speaker 2:  was kind of a thing that happened much later. The notebooks were very personal

652
00:39:39,705 --> 00:39:39,945
Speaker 5:  Much

653
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:43,825
Speaker 2:  Later and very individual. How did that change come about? Like

654
00:39:43,825 --> 00:39:47,585
Speaker 2:  at what point did people start writing notebooks? Even in some of the

655
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:50,225
Speaker 2:  styles that you're talking about, thinking about other people?

656
00:39:51,175 --> 00:39:54,625
Speaker 5:  Very, very late in the day, I would say. I think what's interesting,

657
00:39:55,155 --> 00:39:59,145
Speaker 5:  Leonardo's notebooks are fascinating for two reasons, I think very far

658
00:39:59,155 --> 00:40:02,865
Speaker 5:  apart in time. Firstly, because they're an amazing record of his thoughts,

659
00:40:02,965 --> 00:40:06,945
Speaker 5:  his researchers, his explorations and his personality up to a

660
00:40:06,945 --> 00:40:10,545
Speaker 5:  point so that that period around the year 1500,

661
00:40:10,805 --> 00:40:14,425
Speaker 5:  wow. You know, there was something really incredible going on there. And

662
00:40:14,425 --> 00:40:17,885
Speaker 5:  then basically they just vanish into

663
00:40:17,995 --> 00:40:21,685
Speaker 5:  aristocrats libraries, you know, and no one reads them,

664
00:40:21,985 --> 00:40:24,845
Speaker 5:  no one, they probably pull 'em off the shelf and just look at them as a curiosity.

665
00:40:26,025 --> 00:40:29,285
Speaker 5:  No one studies them at all until the 1890s

666
00:40:29,955 --> 00:40:33,925
Speaker 5:  when a German guy called Richter goes around Europe. He looks at

667
00:40:33,925 --> 00:40:37,725
Speaker 5:  them all, he transcribes them, he researches, he writes about them. And then

668
00:40:37,745 --> 00:40:41,565
Speaker 5:  for the first time, 400 years nearly after Leonardo

669
00:40:41,595 --> 00:40:45,325
Speaker 5:  dies, people actually realize, oh, he wasn't just

670
00:40:45,565 --> 00:40:49,445
Speaker 5:  a good painter, he was also all of these other kinds of genius as well, because

671
00:40:49,465 --> 00:40:53,325
Speaker 5:  he was just known as a painter up to that point. And then,

672
00:40:53,705 --> 00:40:57,445
Speaker 5:  and I think it is a direct result of the publication

673
00:40:57,545 --> 00:41:01,365
Speaker 5:  of Leonardo's notebooks and people understanding that there's this

674
00:41:01,365 --> 00:41:05,045
Speaker 5:  process behind his genius, then everyone else

675
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:08,205
Speaker 5:  starts taking their notebooks much more seriously. So Picasso, for instance,

676
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:12,445
Speaker 5:  he starts painting in the 1890s at exactly the same time or learns how to

677
00:41:12,445 --> 00:41:16,085
Speaker 5:  paint. He's a boy. And he, for instance, took his

678
00:41:16,085 --> 00:41:19,765
Speaker 5:  sketchbooks incredibly seriously. He never gave them away, he never lost

679
00:41:19,765 --> 00:41:23,605
Speaker 5:  them. He kept them filed away in boxes in his house in the south of France,

680
00:41:24,145 --> 00:41:27,605
Speaker 5:  and they were numbered, cataloged, ordered. He knew that his

681
00:41:27,605 --> 00:41:31,525
Speaker 5:  sketchbooks were really important, whereas painters a hundred

682
00:41:31,525 --> 00:41:32,325
Speaker 5:  years before him,

683
00:41:34,005 --> 00:41:37,265
Speaker 5:  it seems to have been a very casual relationship. You know, or rather they,

684
00:41:37,265 --> 00:41:40,385
Speaker 5:  they themselves use their notebooks, but they had no sense that anyone else

685
00:41:40,385 --> 00:41:42,665
Speaker 5:  would ever find him interesting. So

686
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,305
Speaker 5:  yeah, I think there's definitely a change. And I think that Leonardo sort

687
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:50,945
Speaker 5:  of accidentally 400 years after his death prompts it.

688
00:41:51,055 --> 00:41:55,025
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And, and to the extent, you know, if any kind of, well-known writer

689
00:41:55,205 --> 00:41:58,345
Speaker 5:  now will sell their papers to the University of

690
00:42:00,095 --> 00:42:03,875
Speaker 5:  the University of Austin, for instance. Right. You know, collects writer's

691
00:42:04,035 --> 00:42:08,025
Speaker 5:  notebooks and it will pay good money for them a hundred, 150 years

692
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:11,065
Speaker 5:  ago, you know, universities were not doing that, they would, wouldn't have

693
00:42:11,065 --> 00:42:11,505
Speaker 5:  seen the value.

694
00:42:12,005 --> 00:42:15,705
Speaker 2:  Do you think that changes the way we look at those notebooks now? I mean,

695
00:42:15,705 --> 00:42:18,905
Speaker 2:  I I think about even go back to Florence, like you, you, you think about

696
00:42:19,715 --> 00:42:23,345
Speaker 2:  those as an important record of real life

697
00:42:23,925 --> 00:42:27,425
Speaker 2:  in a way that as soon as people become self-conscious that someone else might

698
00:42:27,425 --> 00:42:31,225
Speaker 2:  see their notebooks, it sort of ceases to be a record

699
00:42:31,285 --> 00:42:34,985
Speaker 2:  of real life. It, it becomes an Instagram version of real life

700
00:42:35,035 --> 00:42:38,185
Speaker 2:  where everything is maybe subtly

701
00:42:38,245 --> 00:42:42,105
Speaker 2:  self-consciously changed to be for public consumption

702
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:46,225
Speaker 2:  in a way that, I don't know, like I, we we think about notebooks as these

703
00:42:46,225 --> 00:42:48,985
Speaker 2:  intensely private things, but as soon as you understand that someone else

704
00:42:48,985 --> 00:42:51,785
Speaker 2:  might see it. I wonder if it changes what that thing is.

705
00:42:52,365 --> 00:42:55,985
Speaker 5:  Oh, well, certainly when it comes to diary writing in particular, so the,

706
00:42:56,845 --> 00:43:00,465
Speaker 5:  any number of published diaries you can tell were written with publication

707
00:43:00,465 --> 00:43:04,025
Speaker 5:  in mind. Mm. I write a diary every day and I don't

708
00:43:04,365 --> 00:43:08,345
Speaker 5:  expect that anyone else will ever read it. And it's

709
00:43:08,345 --> 00:43:11,185
Speaker 5:  certainly never gonna be published. And it's, I think you're right. It's

710
00:43:11,185 --> 00:43:14,785
Speaker 5:  more intimate and it's, you know, that it's pretty uncensored

711
00:43:15,795 --> 00:43:19,585
Speaker 5:  unfiltered. But then you have the Tony Blairs of this world

712
00:43:19,585 --> 00:43:23,505
Speaker 5:  whose diaries are published, I think. Sure. And that's a

713
00:43:23,505 --> 00:43:24,985
Speaker 5:  completely different kettle of fish.

714
00:43:25,535 --> 00:43:29,065
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And I guess that's okay. Both of those things can exist, but they are

715
00:43:29,375 --> 00:43:30,265
Speaker 2:  very different things.

716
00:43:30,495 --> 00:43:32,665
Speaker 5:  Yeah, yeah. Very, very definitely. Yeah.

717
00:43:32,855 --> 00:43:36,825
Speaker 2:  Okay. I am really curious about how you as a person in,

718
00:43:36,845 --> 00:43:40,755
Speaker 2:  in a digital world came to think about notebooks. Because

719
00:43:40,755 --> 00:43:44,435
Speaker 2:  again, there is such a, there's so much about

720
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:48,515
Speaker 2:  that history that a feels very modern. Like we're, we're talking about

721
00:43:48,515 --> 00:43:52,235
Speaker 2:  the same kinds of things now and like you said, using computers for the same

722
00:43:52,235 --> 00:43:56,035
Speaker 2:  kinds of things that people were using notebooks for 800 years ago.

723
00:43:57,395 --> 00:43:59,975
Speaker 2:  But I wonder if you're going through and you have to spend time thinking

724
00:43:59,975 --> 00:44:03,735
Speaker 2:  about the thing itself and, and like you said,

725
00:44:03,735 --> 00:44:07,415
Speaker 2:  paper is this crucially important invention, and

726
00:44:07,915 --> 00:44:11,815
Speaker 2:  if we had invented computers in 1200 instead of inventing

727
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:15,655
Speaker 2:  paper, would it have gone roughly the same way? Or is there something

728
00:44:15,655 --> 00:44:19,095
Speaker 2:  about that thing and that time and that invention

729
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:23,775
Speaker 2:  that made it different from even everything that came after?

730
00:44:24,815 --> 00:44:28,295
Speaker 5:  I think up to a point, the invention makes the time. You know,

731
00:44:29,235 --> 00:44:32,685
Speaker 5:  you said to me very confidently that we live in a digital world, you know,

732
00:44:33,265 --> 00:44:37,005
Speaker 5:  and, and of course you are, right? Yeah. We do definitely live in a digital

733
00:44:37,005 --> 00:44:40,805
Speaker 5:  world. We're speaking to each other, you know, via a digital link

734
00:44:40,805 --> 00:44:44,485
Speaker 5:  up and surrounded by amazing technology. I would

735
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:48,005
Speaker 5:  also, if I was being contrarian, say to you, you are living in a notebook

736
00:44:48,005 --> 00:44:51,565
Speaker 5:  world. Hmm. Because capitalism, which gives us all of

737
00:44:51,825 --> 00:44:55,645
Speaker 5:  we, what we see around us, that for 600

738
00:44:55,655 --> 00:44:59,365
Speaker 5:  years was entirely based in notebooks.

739
00:44:59,665 --> 00:45:03,445
Speaker 5:  We would call them ledgers or account books, but it was an entirely

740
00:45:03,725 --> 00:45:06,685
Speaker 5:  notebook based system until the first IBM machines. So,

741
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:11,605
Speaker 5:  and that was invented at the same time as, or roughly speaking the same

742
00:45:11,605 --> 00:45:15,445
Speaker 5:  time as The Notebook arrives in, in Europe, in sort of in that place in

743
00:45:15,445 --> 00:45:19,125
Speaker 5:  Italy around the year 1300. They invent all of the mechanisms of

744
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:23,045
Speaker 5:  capitalism. So really we are in that world as much as we're in the

745
00:45:23,045 --> 00:45:23,525
Speaker 5:  digital world.

746
00:45:25,105 --> 00:45:28,685
Speaker 5:  But yeah, and I, there is definitely a sense of you have an invention

747
00:45:28,905 --> 00:45:32,765
Speaker 5:  and then it shapes the world that you live in. But in unexpected,

748
00:45:33,015 --> 00:45:36,845
Speaker 5:  surprising, fun, hopefully ways no one saw

749
00:45:36,915 --> 00:45:40,805
Speaker 5:  that Twitter was coming 10 years before Twitter arrived. Sure. But, and then

750
00:45:40,925 --> 00:45:43,085
Speaker 5:  suddenly it's everywhere, and then suddenly it's nowhere again. You know?

751
00:45:43,145 --> 00:45:44,725
Speaker 5:  So who knows?

752
00:45:45,345 --> 00:45:48,765
Speaker 2:  So, okay, let's, let's fast forward a bunch in history to,

753
00:45:49,785 --> 00:45:53,365
Speaker 2:  not now, but close to now. And I wanna talk about the bullet journal.

754
00:45:53,725 --> 00:45:56,805
Speaker 2:  And the reason I wanted to start with the Zi is that I feel like you can

755
00:45:56,805 --> 00:46:00,565
Speaker 2:  draw a straight line from that thing in Florence

756
00:46:00,895 --> 00:46:04,885
Speaker 2:  800 years ago to the bullet journal phenomenon of

757
00:46:05,215 --> 00:46:09,125
Speaker 2:  today, like, like a dead straight line through

758
00:46:09,785 --> 00:46:11,445
Speaker 2:  almost a millennium of time.

759
00:46:12,985 --> 00:46:16,845
Speaker 2:  How, how is that possible? Like, why do you think this, this thing,

760
00:46:16,845 --> 00:46:20,805
Speaker 2:  this idea of how we want to record our lives in a physical

761
00:46:21,045 --> 00:46:24,885
Speaker 2:  notebook has been So I consistently

762
00:46:25,495 --> 00:46:28,705
Speaker 2:  persistent over so many centuries.

763
00:46:29,775 --> 00:46:33,145
Speaker 5:  It's a really great, simple, minimal tool. I think like

764
00:46:33,535 --> 00:46:37,465
Speaker 5:  with, with any kind of technology, there's a, there's a, or any kind of invention,

765
00:46:37,465 --> 00:46:41,425
Speaker 5:  there's a real virtue to simplicity. You know, so your, your

766
00:46:41,425 --> 00:46:45,225
Speaker 5:  knife and fork or your chopsticks, chopsticks are great because they're minimal.

767
00:46:45,575 --> 00:46:49,545
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You can't, once you've pictured them, you've invented them once. You

768
00:46:49,545 --> 00:46:53,505
Speaker 5:  cannot improve on them. And a notebook I think is a lot like that. It

769
00:46:53,505 --> 00:46:57,335
Speaker 5:  came to a kind of, very quickly, it became kind of perfect

770
00:46:57,835 --> 00:47:01,255
Speaker 5:  in terms of its how practical it was, how cheap it was, how available it

771
00:47:01,255 --> 00:47:05,215
Speaker 5:  was to everyone. And you can't really improve on that as a bit of

772
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:09,135
Speaker 5:  technology, you know, because, and then people will use it in different

773
00:47:09,135 --> 00:47:12,815
Speaker 5:  ways over history. And bullet journals are, I think, a really good example

774
00:47:12,815 --> 00:47:16,335
Speaker 5:  of how you can take this really simple thing and just use it in a slightly

775
00:47:16,395 --> 00:47:19,935
Speaker 5:  new way. And suddenly it opens possibilities for people which they never

776
00:47:20,085 --> 00:47:22,575
Speaker 5:  appreciated before. Like, there are a lot of people

777
00:47:24,305 --> 00:47:28,055
Speaker 5:  whose genuinely, there are a surprising number of people whose lives have

778
00:47:28,055 --> 00:47:31,815
Speaker 5:  really been improved by doing bullet points to

779
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:35,335
Speaker 5:  organize their life. And it kind of helps them to rationalize things and

780
00:47:35,335 --> 00:47:39,175
Speaker 5:  make proper decisions and act more intentionally and therefore, thereby live

781
00:47:39,175 --> 00:47:43,135
Speaker 5:  happier lives. I think I, I find it constantly incredible

782
00:47:43,195 --> 00:47:47,135
Speaker 5:  how this really simple thing can be reinvented so regularly. But

783
00:47:47,135 --> 00:47:50,215
Speaker 5:  you're right, there is a continuous line all the way through. I think it's

784
00:47:50,215 --> 00:47:54,135
Speaker 5:  just 'cause it's incredibly simple and it doesn't require batteries, it doesn't

785
00:47:54,135 --> 00:47:57,695
Speaker 5:  require system updates. It's, you know, If, you drop it, it doesn't break.

786
00:47:58,405 --> 00:48:01,615
Speaker 2:  What was it that was interesting to you about the bullet journal and, and

787
00:48:01,755 --> 00:48:05,455
Speaker 2:  its history? Like why, why did that jump out to you as a, as a thing worth

788
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:06,735
Speaker 2:  adding to this history?

789
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:09,385
Speaker 5:  It was important to me because,

790
00:48:11,005 --> 00:48:14,575
Speaker 5:  firstly, because it was a, it was a real thing. It was a real trend, you

791
00:48:14,575 --> 00:48:17,295
Speaker 5:  know, when I was starting to think about the book. And it gave me sort of

792
00:48:17,295 --> 00:48:20,375
Speaker 5:  confidence that there was gonna be an appetite of people who were interested

793
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:24,135
Speaker 5:  in this stuff, which is very key in terms of building

794
00:48:24,195 --> 00:48:28,095
Speaker 5:  my confidence. And then what was interesting was, I never,

795
00:48:28,165 --> 00:48:31,495
Speaker 5:  I've never bullet journaled myself. I've never done the writer Carroll method,

796
00:48:31,915 --> 00:48:35,735
Speaker 5:  but I got his book and then I spoke to him, interviewed him, and

797
00:48:36,525 --> 00:48:40,455
Speaker 5:  he's really thought about it quite deeply. And he's thought about

798
00:48:40,475 --> 00:48:44,255
Speaker 5:  the implications of writing stuff down and of organizing your thoughts on

799
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:46,855
Speaker 5:  the page and having this notebook, which you carry everywhere, and which

800
00:48:46,855 --> 00:48:50,815
Speaker 5:  you write everything down on. And that kind of encouraged me to

801
00:48:50,815 --> 00:48:54,015
Speaker 5:  think deeply about it too. Mm. You know, he's taken it very seriously for

802
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:57,175
Speaker 5:  a long time and he's thought about it in a particular way and I'm, I've got

803
00:48:57,175 --> 00:48:59,775
Speaker 5:  a more historical angle and I think about it in different ways, but they're

804
00:48:59,775 --> 00:49:03,455
Speaker 5:  completely compatible. But the, just the fact that he had taken

805
00:49:03,595 --> 00:49:07,495
Speaker 5:  it seriously, I found really interesting and, and hence

806
00:49:07,495 --> 00:49:11,295
Speaker 5:  giving him a chapter, I think was, you know, kind of fair because

807
00:49:11,635 --> 00:49:15,495
Speaker 5:  he was really about the only person who had written a book about notebooking,

808
00:49:15,675 --> 00:49:19,615
Speaker 5:  you know? Yeah. Before I did so. And he also

809
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:23,055
Speaker 5:  had some really interesting things to say about notebooks, which aren't bullet

810
00:49:23,055 --> 00:49:26,535
Speaker 5:  journals. He was really inspired for instance, by kind of artists

811
00:49:27,745 --> 00:49:30,615
Speaker 5:  scrapbooks and, and sort of collages and

812
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:34,895
Speaker 5:  sketchbooks, which were sort of more than sketchbooks, which had elements

813
00:49:34,895 --> 00:49:38,735
Speaker 5:  of diary in them. So not pure bullet journal stuff, but stuff, which is

814
00:49:39,135 --> 00:49:43,055
Speaker 5:  a really interesting expression of your experience. And, and

815
00:49:43,175 --> 00:49:45,095
Speaker 5:  Ryder definitely put me onto those things.

816
00:49:46,035 --> 00:49:48,695
Speaker 2:  Why do you think that way of thinking about

817
00:49:49,735 --> 00:49:53,695
Speaker 2:  notebooking and journaling and keeping track of your life lagged so

818
00:49:53,695 --> 00:49:57,615
Speaker 2:  much? The business side of things, which as you

819
00:49:57,945 --> 00:50:01,215
Speaker 2:  chart in the book, got really systematized and really

820
00:50:02,015 --> 00:50:04,935
Speaker 2:  specific. And like we, we built capitalism on top of these things, right?

821
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:08,815
Speaker 2:  Like double entry accounting became a worldwide phenomenon and people

822
00:50:08,815 --> 00:50:12,455
Speaker 2:  understood how to do it. And there were kind of accepted rules

823
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:16,495
Speaker 2:  on how to keep these kinds of notebooks. But in people doing

824
00:50:16,655 --> 00:50:19,655
Speaker 2:  it in their own lives, like you said, there have been bits and pieces of

825
00:50:19,655 --> 00:50:20,455
Speaker 2:  this over time, but

826
00:50:22,495 --> 00:50:26,215
Speaker 2:  somebody like Ryder Carroll comes along hundreds of years later and

827
00:50:26,215 --> 00:50:30,085
Speaker 2:  really thinks like, okay, how can I break this thing down into sort of

828
00:50:30,085 --> 00:50:33,965
Speaker 2:  understandable, repeatable pieces that just happened much later? Why do you

829
00:50:33,965 --> 00:50:34,285
Speaker 2:  think that is?

830
00:50:35,345 --> 00:50:39,025
Speaker 5:  Honestly, I have no idea. There, there are que there are

831
00:50:39,225 --> 00:50:41,865
Speaker 5:  questions you can't answer. I mean, the, the another big question, which

832
00:50:41,865 --> 00:50:45,785
Speaker 5:  I just have no idea, is why did people start writing diaries?

833
00:50:46,645 --> 00:50:50,545
Speaker 5:  Or, or rather, why did they start writing diaries in England

834
00:50:50,845 --> 00:50:54,645
Speaker 5:  in around the year 1570 when they'd never

835
00:50:54,645 --> 00:50:58,405
Speaker 5:  done them anywhere else in the world before? I've looked really hard at trying

836
00:50:58,405 --> 00:51:02,085
Speaker 5:  to find out what was so special about England at that time, which made people

837
00:51:02,135 --> 00:51:05,965
Speaker 5:  start to keep a diary like you would you an emotional diary of how

838
00:51:05,995 --> 00:51:09,885
Speaker 5:  they felt about the day's events. I, I, sorry, not very good podcast

839
00:51:10,205 --> 00:51:13,845
Speaker 5:  material. I'm making a baffled expression. Listen to picture that.

840
00:51:14,075 --> 00:51:18,005
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I have no idea. And I think your, my answer to your question is, it's

841
00:51:18,005 --> 00:51:19,605
Speaker 5:  a good question. I have no idea.

842
00:51:20,195 --> 00:51:24,085
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's, I, I have, I have a theory and it's based on nothing,

843
00:51:24,225 --> 00:51:26,925
Speaker 2:  but it's a theory and I'm gonna, I'm gonna give you my theory as a way of

844
00:51:26,925 --> 00:51:29,485
Speaker 2:  asking you another question, which I also have about this. I'm here for it.

845
00:51:30,445 --> 00:51:33,585
Speaker 2:  I think as, especially as

846
00:51:34,445 --> 00:51:37,945
Speaker 2:  we became more enmeshed with digital tools,

847
00:51:39,255 --> 00:51:43,025
Speaker 2:  life took on like a new level of informational chaos.

848
00:51:43,515 --> 00:51:47,425
Speaker 2:  There is just more stuff coming at us now than there ever has been.

849
00:51:47,685 --> 00:51:51,545
Speaker 2:  And that's true in our professional lives, but it's also

850
00:51:51,545 --> 00:51:54,665
Speaker 2:  true in our personal lives. I think in a, in a new way

851
00:51:56,035 --> 00:51:59,695
Speaker 2:  in the last, I don't know, several decades, that there's just more

852
00:52:00,095 --> 00:52:04,015
Speaker 2:  happening around you and to you all the time. And

853
00:52:04,585 --> 00:52:07,655
Speaker 2:  we're, we're still reckoning with that as people, right? This question of

854
00:52:07,655 --> 00:52:11,495
Speaker 2:  like, we understand what is going on in the world in a way that we are

855
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:15,295
Speaker 2:  like evolutionarily not equipped to do, and what do we do with that? All

856
00:52:15,295 --> 00:52:19,215
Speaker 2:  these really interesting questions. But I think one thing that I see all

857
00:52:19,215 --> 00:52:22,775
Speaker 2:  the time is people crave systems. There there is this idea that

858
00:52:23,075 --> 00:52:26,735
Speaker 2:  if I can just find a way to make this make sense,

859
00:52:27,425 --> 00:52:30,455
Speaker 2:  everything will be better, right? And I think, and you, you mentioned the,

860
00:52:30,455 --> 00:52:34,255
Speaker 2:  the getting things done method in, in the book also. And I think that

861
00:52:34,255 --> 00:52:37,135
Speaker 2:  speaks to the same thing where it's like, yeah, there's this swirling mass

862
00:52:37,155 --> 00:52:40,975
Speaker 2:  of stuff in my life and If you can just tell me where

863
00:52:40,975 --> 00:52:44,935
Speaker 2:  to put it and how my brain will get quieter. And I think

864
00:52:44,935 --> 00:52:48,815
Speaker 2:  that's meaningful to people. And, and again, i I, there there is

865
00:52:48,855 --> 00:52:52,575
Speaker 2:  a definite sort of, we are people of our time and technology

866
00:52:53,105 --> 00:52:56,855
Speaker 2:  thing that is all kind of swirling together there. But I feel like when I

867
00:52:56,875 --> 00:53:00,815
Speaker 2:  see people who like really love bullet journal what it, what it says is like,

868
00:53:01,035 --> 00:53:04,655
Speaker 2:  the world is insane and messy, but I have made this thing

869
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:08,615
Speaker 2:  that is like my world and it is beautiful and looks like me and it

870
00:53:08,615 --> 00:53:11,935
Speaker 2:  just feels good. And it's why like, people get mad at all the bullet journalists

871
00:53:11,935 --> 00:53:15,175
Speaker 2:  who are like spending all of their time organizing their pages and not time

872
00:53:15,175 --> 00:53:18,655
Speaker 2:  getting stuff done. And it's like, no, the the organizing the pages is actually

873
00:53:18,655 --> 00:53:22,215
Speaker 2:  the point of the thing. Yeah. As much as anything else, it's taking control,

874
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:26,005
Speaker 2:  right? Like making The Notebook is the point. And I, I feel like that was

875
00:53:26,005 --> 00:53:29,005
Speaker 2:  one of the things that just keeps coming up throughout history in your book

876
00:53:29,025 --> 00:53:32,885
Speaker 2:  is like the act of making the thing is as much the point as anything else.

877
00:53:32,895 --> 00:53:36,565
Speaker 2:  Going back and reviewing it is fine. Doing stuff with what you put in it

878
00:53:36,565 --> 00:53:40,325
Speaker 2:  is fine, but the act of making The Notebook in the first place is

879
00:53:40,325 --> 00:53:43,005
Speaker 2:  maybe the most important part of the whole process. And I feel like there's

880
00:53:43,445 --> 00:53:47,405
Speaker 2:  so much of that happening right now that yeah, we need structure around

881
00:53:47,405 --> 00:53:49,405
Speaker 2:  that more than ever. Yeah, that's just a theory.

882
00:53:49,985 --> 00:53:53,005
Speaker 5:  That's it. And my answers to that is yes,

883
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:58,085
Speaker 5:  that's the short answer. Slightly, slightly more involved example, or to

884
00:53:58,085 --> 00:54:01,965
Speaker 5:  sort of back up what you said. So I have a day job and

885
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:05,965
Speaker 5:  I do this, I write books and talk to people

886
00:54:05,965 --> 00:54:09,885
Speaker 5:  about it. And so the level of inputs

887
00:54:10,075 --> 00:54:14,045
Speaker 5:  into my life in terms of communication and things flying at me from different

888
00:54:14,045 --> 00:54:18,005
Speaker 5:  directions. I've got two email addresses. I've got the Instagram,

889
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:21,405
Speaker 5:  I've got the Twitter, which I'm switching off shortly, but I've got the,

890
00:54:21,545 --> 00:54:25,445
Speaker 5:  the Facebook, I've got WhatsApp on the phone,

891
00:54:26,465 --> 00:54:30,045
Speaker 5:  et cetera, et cetera. It just goes on. And that's before I'm in a room

892
00:54:30,195 --> 00:54:33,445
Speaker 5:  with anyone actually talking to them face to face. And my way of dealing

893
00:54:33,445 --> 00:54:37,165
Speaker 5:  with this is to write a diary. Yeah. So at the end of the day,

894
00:54:37,405 --> 00:54:41,205
Speaker 5:  I will put it all down in here and, and it's,

895
00:54:41,515 --> 00:54:44,245
Speaker 5:  it's under control as you say. And I've turned this

896
00:54:45,355 --> 00:54:48,885
Speaker 5:  ephemeral nonstop flow of craziness,

897
00:54:49,395 --> 00:54:52,845
Speaker 5:  most of which is completely trivial, but has to be managed somehow.

898
00:54:53,745 --> 00:54:57,285
Speaker 5:  And I've just turned it into a calm thing on the page.

899
00:54:57,475 --> 00:55:01,205
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I completely agree. And as to how that makes me feel, the

900
00:55:01,205 --> 00:55:05,125
Speaker 5:  analogy I use is it's

901
00:55:05,125 --> 00:55:08,325
Speaker 5:  like having a shower. Yeah. Showers are lovely. Yeah. Just great.

902
00:55:09,045 --> 00:55:12,325
Speaker 5:  I like to have a shower every day, but if I can't, if I have to go a day

903
00:55:12,325 --> 00:55:15,805
Speaker 5:  without, that's fine. No one really minds two days

904
00:55:16,005 --> 00:55:19,285
Speaker 5:  without it's, you know, mentally I start to smell.

905
00:55:19,845 --> 00:55:22,765
Speaker 5:  So, and that's what I'm like with the diary. That's really good. Now If,

906
00:55:22,765 --> 00:55:26,645
Speaker 5:  you miss a day. Yeah, I can't miss two days. I start to smell mentally and,

907
00:55:26,665 --> 00:55:30,125
Speaker 5:  and it really cleans me out. Sort of that process of just dumping it on the

908
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:34,005
Speaker 5:  page really, really is refreshing and cleansing in that sense.

909
00:55:34,155 --> 00:55:34,445
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

910
00:55:34,685 --> 00:55:38,405
Speaker 2:  I like that a lot. Why do you think we haven't found a way to do

911
00:55:39,355 --> 00:55:43,085
Speaker 2:  that digitally in the way that is satisfying and

912
00:55:43,765 --> 00:55:47,535
Speaker 2:  valuable in the same way that we have in notebooks? Because

913
00:55:47,535 --> 00:55:51,455
Speaker 2:  like, we pretty much do business on computers now there, there's

914
00:55:51,455 --> 00:55:55,415
Speaker 2:  not a lot of paper notebooks out there responsible for

915
00:55:55,415 --> 00:55:59,295
Speaker 2:  how capitalism runs anymore. Yeah. But I think I, I am someone

916
00:55:59,515 --> 00:56:03,215
Speaker 2:  who has tried every note taking app on planet Earth.

917
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:07,455
Speaker 2:  I I obsessively use them. I build these systems and

918
00:56:07,955 --> 00:56:11,735
Speaker 2:  overwhelmingly the ones that feel the best. And as I talk to people, the

919
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:15,615
Speaker 2:  answer is you try them all and you eventually just get a nice notebook and

920
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:18,575
Speaker 2:  a pen and you start filling it. Yeah. And there is, there is something about

921
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:21,775
Speaker 2:  that that we have not replaced. And I'm curious, If you have thoughts on

922
00:56:21,915 --> 00:56:23,685
Speaker 2:  why it has been so hard to replace?

923
00:56:24,595 --> 00:56:27,755
Speaker 5:  I have lots of thoughts. I'm gonna give you the deepest one because please.

924
00:56:27,955 --> 00:56:31,195
Speaker 5:  I think this is, I think your listener can cope with a, a sort of high level

925
00:56:32,095 --> 00:56:36,075
Speaker 5:  bit of neurobiology. So when you write on a

926
00:56:36,235 --> 00:56:40,195
Speaker 5:  notebook page, and they've done this with MRI scans and the very clever

927
00:56:40,215 --> 00:56:43,995
Speaker 5:  way of using multiple men mineral I scan called voxel based morpho.

928
00:56:44,185 --> 00:56:47,715
Speaker 5:  When you can look at multiple brains at once, when you write in a notebook,

929
00:56:48,375 --> 00:56:51,475
Speaker 5:  you use different parts of the brain to when you type

930
00:56:52,255 --> 00:56:55,915
Speaker 5:  or when you write something on your phone or your tablet. And one of the

931
00:56:55,915 --> 00:56:59,755
Speaker 5:  different parts you use is the hippocampus. Now this is right in the

932
00:56:59,755 --> 00:57:03,395
Speaker 5:  bottom of the brain and it's your mental map. So when you

933
00:57:03,805 --> 00:57:07,315
Speaker 5:  drive to your place of work, you are using your

934
00:57:07,315 --> 00:57:11,035
Speaker 5:  hippocampus. When you know where the coffee

935
00:57:11,105 --> 00:57:14,955
Speaker 5:  cups are in your kitchen, you are using the hippocampus. Taxi drivers, cab

936
00:57:14,955 --> 00:57:17,915
Speaker 5:  drivers have amazingly well developed hippo campi,

937
00:57:19,175 --> 00:57:22,955
Speaker 5:  an early case study in brain plasticity actually. Right.

938
00:57:23,095 --> 00:57:26,955
Speaker 5:  So this is very interesting. Why do you engage your hippocampus when you're

939
00:57:26,955 --> 00:57:30,635
Speaker 5:  writing in a notebook? And it's because your notebook is a place,

940
00:57:31,405 --> 00:57:34,195
Speaker 5:  right? And it has its own geography. So when you write things on the pages

941
00:57:34,195 --> 00:57:36,995
Speaker 5:  of a notebook, you remember, or I certainly tend to remember, oh, that was

942
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:40,675
Speaker 5:  on the left hand side at the top. Oh, that was I, I wrote that in blue somewhere.

943
00:57:40,675 --> 00:57:44,475
Speaker 5:  Now that was at the back of The Notebook that was at the front. And I'm

944
00:57:44,475 --> 00:57:48,235
Speaker 5:  thinking about The Notebook in quite a different way to how I think about

945
00:57:48,275 --> 00:57:52,035
Speaker 5:  a digital note and what they think the people who research this

946
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:56,555
Speaker 5:  is that when you scroll or you carry on writing and what

947
00:57:56,555 --> 00:58:00,315
Speaker 5:  you've written on a screen just scrolls up up top of the page and

948
00:58:00,315 --> 00:58:01,675
Speaker 5:  vanishes off the top of your screen.

949
00:58:03,215 --> 00:58:07,195
Speaker 5:  It just vanishes. It has no place in the geography of your lived

950
00:58:07,195 --> 00:58:10,995
Speaker 5:  experience, unlike stuff which you write down in a notebook page. So I've

951
00:58:10,995 --> 00:58:13,875
Speaker 5:  got my yellow notebook and I know that if I open it halfway through, roughly

952
00:58:14,195 --> 00:58:17,835
Speaker 5:  speaking, I'm gonna find what happened in July. And I can't do that

953
00:58:18,385 --> 00:58:22,195
Speaker 5:  with notes I've made on an iPad, but just because my

954
00:58:22,195 --> 00:58:25,355
Speaker 5:  brain hasn't thought about them in that geographic way. So that's one reason

955
00:58:26,055 --> 00:58:29,995
Speaker 5:  why you feel more comfortable and you navigate those notes more

956
00:58:29,995 --> 00:58:32,435
Speaker 5:  happily than you do when they're digital.

957
00:58:33,765 --> 00:58:37,635
Speaker 5:  Other reasons are to do with I think the sort of the sensory experience of

958
00:58:37,635 --> 00:58:41,475
Speaker 5:  writing fingers on the page, the pen in your hand being a slightly richer

959
00:58:41,475 --> 00:58:44,995
Speaker 5:  experience. It's more difficult as well, it's very easy to type.

960
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:49,155
Speaker 5:  You can type, you could roughly speaking type everything I

961
00:58:49,155 --> 00:58:53,035
Speaker 5:  said to you right now, you'd get it all pretty much down. You

962
00:58:53,035 --> 00:58:56,675
Speaker 5:  can't do that with the pen and ink. You have to filter, you have to pause

963
00:58:56,815 --> 00:59:00,795
Speaker 5:  the ideas, you have to process them and paraphrase. And that

964
00:59:00,805 --> 00:59:04,755
Speaker 5:  gives you a much richer, deeper understanding of what you

965
00:59:04,755 --> 00:59:08,475
Speaker 5:  are actually listening to. You can type whatever

966
00:59:08,635 --> 00:59:12,555
Speaker 5:  I say without actually listening to what I'm saying at all, but to write

967
00:59:12,555 --> 00:59:15,955
Speaker 5:  it down, you have to paraphrase it and therefore you have to actually interact

968
00:59:15,955 --> 00:59:19,915
Speaker 5:  with the ideas. So this is why teachers and academics much

969
00:59:19,975 --> 00:59:23,365
Speaker 5:  prefer their students to, to write notes rather than to type them.

970
00:59:23,945 --> 00:59:25,005
Speaker 5:  So there's a couple of answers.

971
00:59:25,305 --> 00:59:28,725
Speaker 2:  Do you think there's a marriage there that we can make work? I mean, I keep

972
00:59:28,725 --> 00:59:32,005
Speaker 2:  thinking about you, you start the book with moleskin, which is probably

973
00:59:32,865 --> 00:59:35,765
Speaker 2:  the first notebook most people think of when they think of notebooks. And

974
00:59:36,405 --> 00:59:40,285
Speaker 2:  moleskin for years has been building digital tools

975
00:59:40,825 --> 00:59:44,125
Speaker 2:  and they have, they have a really beautiful calendar app. They have a really

976
00:59:44,405 --> 00:59:48,245
Speaker 2:  interesting journaling system. Like it, it's all very good. Nobody

977
00:59:48,295 --> 00:59:51,725
Speaker 2:  cares about it the way that they care about physical moleskin notebooks.

978
00:59:51,905 --> 00:59:55,845
Speaker 2:  No. And you know, there, there was this phase for a long time of

979
00:59:55,845 --> 00:59:59,605
Speaker 2:  like, maybe we're gonna do smart pens where I'll write

980
00:59:59,625 --> 01:00:03,045
Speaker 2:  in a notebook, but it will transcribe it digitally. And now there are things

981
01:00:03,045 --> 01:00:05,725
Speaker 2:  where like, okay, you can write with a pen, but it's on your iPad and it

982
01:00:05,725 --> 01:00:09,365
Speaker 2:  will recognize the text and make something out of it. And it feels like we're,

983
01:00:09,365 --> 01:00:12,925
Speaker 2:  we're poking at this thing where the, the act that you're describing, I think

984
01:00:12,925 --> 01:00:16,765
Speaker 2:  is absolutely the best one. But having a

985
01:00:16,965 --> 01:00:20,645
Speaker 2:  notebook that is a bunch of words on a page that

986
01:00:20,715 --> 01:00:24,525
Speaker 2:  sits on my bookshelf waiting for me to do something

987
01:00:24,525 --> 01:00:28,485
Speaker 2:  with it feels like it's missing something. Like there is a best of

988
01:00:28,485 --> 01:00:32,445
Speaker 2:  both worlds here that I think I desperately want to exist. And I don't

989
01:00:32,445 --> 01:00:35,685
Speaker 2:  know, maybe, maybe it just doesn't and can't and won't. But I am curious,

990
01:00:35,685 --> 01:00:37,925
Speaker 2:  like, do you, do you think we can marry those two things?

991
01:00:40,665 --> 01:00:44,525
Speaker 5:  I'm not gonna say never. Okay. But I've not seen it done yet in a way which

992
01:00:44,845 --> 01:00:48,645
Speaker 5:  I think some people that sort of the moleskin magic paper, the

993
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:52,165
Speaker 5:  dotted paper, whatever, they, they make it work for them and, and good luck

994
01:00:52,185 --> 01:00:55,805
Speaker 5:  and that's great. And some people also managed to make those

995
01:00:55,995 --> 01:00:59,765
Speaker 5:  kind of posh tablets, the, the remarkable tablets work

996
01:00:59,825 --> 01:01:02,525
Speaker 5:  in in a similar way. And again, go you

997
01:01:03,375 --> 01:01:05,405
Speaker 5:  personally, I haven't ever managed to.

998
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:09,765
Speaker 2:  Okay, last thing and then I will truly let you go. Tell me just

999
01:01:09,765 --> 01:01:13,645
Speaker 2:  briefly about moleskin and why you, you start the book with

1000
01:01:13,645 --> 01:01:17,605
Speaker 2:  moleskin. I wanna end our podcast with moleskin. Why is moleskin

1001
01:01:18,465 --> 01:01:22,445
Speaker 2:  so ascendant? What, what is it about this company and this thing

1002
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:26,325
Speaker 2:  that has made Moleskin the brand? The Notebook the thing

1003
01:01:26,425 --> 01:01:27,965
Speaker 2:  in our sort of modern world,

1004
01:01:29,075 --> 01:01:32,445
Speaker 5:  It's the complete refinement she took,

1005
01:01:32,905 --> 01:01:36,685
Speaker 5:  and I I say she, Maria Seg Bondi, who was the woman who

1006
01:01:36,965 --> 01:01:40,565
Speaker 5:  conceived the, the moleskin notebook, who took the very simple basic

1007
01:01:40,885 --> 01:01:44,645
Speaker 5:  notebook that we knew she added to it. She added this little elastic

1008
01:01:44,695 --> 01:01:48,245
Speaker 5:  strap, the pocket in the back that it'll page at the front saying, If, you

1009
01:01:48,245 --> 01:01:52,005
Speaker 5:  find this notebook, please return it to, she added all of these things

1010
01:01:52,025 --> 01:01:55,845
Speaker 5:  to a very minimal product and she somehow made it seem even more

1011
01:01:55,845 --> 01:01:59,165
Speaker 5:  minimal. Right? So, and the

1012
01:01:59,395 --> 01:02:02,605
Speaker 5:  analogy I make, she made, she made it minimal and she made it black. And

1013
01:02:02,605 --> 01:02:05,725
Speaker 5:  that was the most Italian thing you could do is like pair old sunglasses,

1014
01:02:06,455 --> 01:02:10,365
Speaker 5:  Prada, little black dress, espresso. You know, that's what they do.

1015
01:02:10,365 --> 01:02:13,245
Speaker 5:  They make it minimal and black. And she did that and somehow

1016
01:02:14,185 --> 01:02:17,885
Speaker 5:  she just, she tricked us. If you like, she fooled us. And

1017
01:02:17,895 --> 01:02:20,325
Speaker 5:  thank God that she did, I wouldn't have written this book if it wasn't for

1018
01:02:20,325 --> 01:02:24,085
Speaker 5:  Moleskins. I think because she made us look again at this simple notebook

1019
01:02:24,145 --> 01:02:27,645
Speaker 5:  and think of it as something which had some material value, that had some

1020
01:02:27,885 --> 01:02:31,765
Speaker 5:  material beauty and was, could be therefore inspiring in

1021
01:02:31,765 --> 01:02:35,685
Speaker 5:  a way that your school exercise book couldn't be. Hmm. So she's, from that

1022
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:39,565
Speaker 5:  point of view, she's my heroine creatively, she's also

1023
01:02:40,185 --> 01:02:44,165
Speaker 5:  for me a figure of awe because If, you look at Moleskin's numbers, the company's

1024
01:02:44,165 --> 01:02:47,885
Speaker 5:  numbers through history, that company's profit margin

1025
01:02:48,305 --> 01:02:52,085
Speaker 5:  is ridiculous. It's like 43% profit every year, gross

1026
01:02:52,085 --> 01:02:55,325
Speaker 5:  profit. And it's a manufacturing company. No company does that,

1027
01:02:55,985 --> 01:02:59,685
Speaker 5:  you know, how did they do it? So I take my hat off to her and

1028
01:03:00,005 --> 01:03:03,925
Speaker 5:  I can forget quite easily about all of the ridiculous collaborations

1029
01:03:03,925 --> 01:03:06,085
Speaker 5:  with Evernote and Adobe and things like that.

1030
01:03:06,515 --> 01:03:08,485
Speaker 2:  Yeah, listen, you gotta do some weird stuff because

1031
01:03:08,485 --> 01:03:10,245
Speaker 5:  The, the key product is amazing. Yeah,

1032
01:03:10,315 --> 01:03:14,165
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Well, and to that point, actually, one of the things you, you say kind

1033
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:17,405
Speaker 2:  of as an aside in the book is that there are

1034
01:03:18,205 --> 01:03:22,045
Speaker 2:  a million other notebooks that are like, they, they give you ideas and prompts

1035
01:03:22,045 --> 01:03:24,885
Speaker 2:  and they put stuff inside and they're like, this one's for your recipes,

1036
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:28,325
Speaker 2:  this one is for your travels. And what actually turns out to be the case

1037
01:03:28,325 --> 01:03:31,325
Speaker 2:  is nobody wants that. They want the blank one. Yeah. And I think that is

1038
01:03:31,325 --> 01:03:35,205
Speaker 2:  like as a, as a perfect metaphor for all of this that just carries with

1039
01:03:35,205 --> 01:03:38,405
Speaker 2:  me through the whole thing that like you can, you can make it whatever you

1040
01:03:38,405 --> 01:03:41,045
Speaker 2:  want, you can guss it up and people will want the blank one because then

1041
01:03:41,045 --> 01:03:44,165
Speaker 2:  they can do what they want with it. And there's something very powerful in

1042
01:03:44,165 --> 01:03:44,325
Speaker 2:  that.

1043
01:03:44,875 --> 01:03:45,565
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Freedom.

1044
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:49,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I mean that's the story of The Notebook, right? It is permanence and

1045
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:51,245
Speaker 2:  it's freedom in, in very real ways. Lovely.

1046
01:03:51,505 --> 01:03:55,445
Speaker 5:  Yes. I'll take that. Can I, can I, can I have that? Yeah,

1047
01:03:55,445 --> 01:03:56,205
Speaker 5:  I'll, I'll take that.

1048
01:03:57,505 --> 01:03:58,005
Speaker 3:  All right, we

1049
01:03:58,005 --> 01:04:00,485
Speaker 2:  Gotta take one more break and then we're gonna come back and take a question

1050
01:04:00,485 --> 01:04:02,085
Speaker 2:  from The Vergecast hotline. We'll be right

1051
01:04:02,085 --> 01:04:02,245
Speaker 3:  Back.

1052
01:05:16,355 --> 01:05:20,245
Speaker 2:  Alright, we're back. Let's get to the hotline as always. The number is 8 6 6

1053
01:05:20,485 --> 01:05:24,445
Speaker 2:  VERGE one one. The email is vergecast at The Verge dot com. Please send us

1054
01:05:24,465 --> 01:05:27,765
Speaker 2:  all of your questions. We have a couple of specific hotline things we're

1055
01:05:27,765 --> 01:05:31,485
Speaker 2:  gonna do in the next couple of months before the end of the year. So keep

1056
01:05:31,485 --> 01:05:35,085
Speaker 2:  an eye on our socials, we'll mention it on this show, but all of your questions,

1057
01:05:35,315 --> 01:05:39,005
Speaker 2:  send 'em to the hotline. We love it this week. Like I mentioned, we have

1058
01:05:39,005 --> 01:05:42,365
Speaker 2:  something slightly different. We got a question that sent our producer will

1059
01:05:42,365 --> 01:05:46,165
Speaker 2:  pour down a pretty wild rabbit hole inside the TikTok

1060
01:05:46,165 --> 01:05:49,005
Speaker 2:  shop. So here, let me just play you the question and then Will's gonna take

1061
01:05:49,005 --> 01:05:49,885
Speaker 2:  it away. Here we go

1062
01:05:51,765 --> 01:05:55,165
Speaker 6:  Everyone. This is Sean from Ohio. I know that

1063
01:05:55,755 --> 01:05:59,725
Speaker 6:  Neli specifically hates CarPlay, but one

1064
01:05:59,725 --> 01:06:03,485
Speaker 6:  thing I've been seeing pop up on TikTok a bunch lately is

1065
01:06:03,495 --> 01:06:07,285
Speaker 6:  these CarPlay adaptable screens that

1066
01:06:07,315 --> 01:06:10,845
Speaker 6:  they plug into your car somehow. And it's kind of like a

1067
01:06:11,325 --> 01:06:15,245
Speaker 6:  retrofit for old vehicles to use CarPlay

1068
01:06:15,245 --> 01:06:19,125
Speaker 6:  or Android Auto. I've been seeing 'em all over TikTok lately. I don't

1069
01:06:19,125 --> 01:06:23,005
Speaker 6:  know if this is vaporware, if this is real. Until the other day I saw one

1070
01:06:23,005 --> 01:06:26,685
Speaker 6:  out in the wild in a car next to me and I wanted to wave 'em down and ask

1071
01:06:26,685 --> 01:06:29,765
Speaker 6:  them if it's good or not. So wondering, If, you guys think they're good?

1072
01:06:30,425 --> 01:06:34,045
Speaker 6:  Is this just a crazy technology or whatever?

1073
01:06:34,485 --> 01:06:36,965
Speaker 6:  Anyways, love to hear your opinion. Thanks, bye

1074
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:41,575
Speaker 7:  So I am the proud owner of a 2006 Toyota Prius,

1075
01:06:42,035 --> 01:06:45,855
Speaker 7:  and I would love to have CarPlay. So as soon as I heard this

1076
01:06:45,855 --> 01:06:49,095
Speaker 7:  hotline question, I went on TikTok and I just searched for

1077
01:06:49,455 --> 01:06:53,375
Speaker 7:  CarPlay screen and I found exactly what our listener

1078
01:06:53,375 --> 01:06:54,455
Speaker 7:  Sean was looking at.

1079
01:06:55,035 --> 01:06:58,255
Speaker 8:  If you're like me and you have a much older car that you want to feel more

1080
01:06:58,365 --> 01:07:01,615
Speaker 8:  expensive, you need this portable Apple CarPlay.

1081
01:07:01,725 --> 01:07:05,015
Speaker 9:  Once you connect it to the CarPlay, it has your phone, your messages, all

1082
01:07:05,015 --> 01:07:07,015
Speaker 9:  your different apps on there as well. And

1083
01:07:07,015 --> 01:07:10,935
Speaker 10:  It's a great price. Don't sleep on this shop at the

1084
01:07:10,935 --> 01:07:13,615
Speaker 10:  link below. You could save yourself hundreds of dollars.

1085
01:07:14,065 --> 01:07:18,015
Speaker 7:  There are at least a couple of different models for sale on the

1086
01:07:18,015 --> 01:07:21,775
Speaker 7:  shop. The one I saw the most was made by he Ha hi ha,

1087
01:07:22,255 --> 01:07:25,895
Speaker 7:  H-I-E-H-A. It's a seven inch color

1088
01:07:25,895 --> 01:07:29,615
Speaker 7:  touchscreen. It comes with a couple of different mounting options for your

1089
01:07:29,635 --> 01:07:33,575
Speaker 7:  car and they throw in a backup camera. And all of

1090
01:07:33,575 --> 01:07:37,215
Speaker 7:  that is $37, allegedly marked down from

1091
01:07:37,335 --> 01:07:40,455
Speaker 7:  120, which is a very suspicious markdown.

1092
01:07:41,415 --> 01:07:45,175
Speaker 7:  I also found a lot of really similar listings for similar

1093
01:07:45,615 --> 01:07:48,695
Speaker 7:  products, similar prices, similar markdowns.

1094
01:07:49,405 --> 01:07:53,015
Speaker 7:  I've never bought anything on TikTok. It was all really overwhelming

1095
01:07:53,355 --> 01:07:57,055
Speaker 7:  and all a little bit sketchy feeling. So Sean, I

1096
01:07:57,055 --> 01:08:00,775
Speaker 7:  completely understand your feeling of, is this real? Is this not

1097
01:08:00,805 --> 01:08:04,335
Speaker 7:  real? You know, it all kind of reminded me of

1098
01:08:04,795 --> 01:08:08,495
Speaker 7:  the, you know, page seven of an Amazon search result

1099
01:08:08,525 --> 01:08:12,495
Speaker 7:  page for a gadget, but it's $37. That is

1100
01:08:12,495 --> 01:08:16,125
Speaker 7:  an amount of money that The Verge can put on the line on your behalf. So

1101
01:08:16,485 --> 01:08:17,085
Speaker 7:  I ordered it.

1102
01:08:17,995 --> 01:08:21,725
Speaker 11:  Okay, I got my CarPlay screen in the mail.

1103
01:08:23,025 --> 01:08:26,805
Speaker 11:  The brand on the box is Uni Uni, but it

1104
01:08:26,805 --> 01:08:30,605
Speaker 11:  says from TikTok Incorporated. It came very

1105
01:08:30,605 --> 01:08:30,805
Speaker 11:  quickly.

1106
01:08:33,975 --> 01:08:34,765
Speaker 12:  Let's open it up.

1107
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:39,725
Speaker 7:  My first impressions of it, seven inches is actually a pretty big screen.

1108
01:08:39,945 --> 01:08:43,925
Speaker 7:  It kind of has an iPad mini vibe to it. It seems solid

1109
01:08:43,945 --> 01:08:47,765
Speaker 7:  enough. It comes with a power cable that goes out to a cigarette

1110
01:08:47,765 --> 01:08:50,725
Speaker 7:  lighter or it's A-U-S-B-C If. you happen to have that.

1111
01:08:51,675 --> 01:08:55,405
Speaker 7:  There's an ox cable that it comes with. It's got the backup camera

1112
01:08:55,705 --> 01:08:59,485
Speaker 7:  and the wiring and two different suction or adhesive

1113
01:08:59,485 --> 01:09:03,325
Speaker 7:  mounting options for your dashboard. The screen itself is

1114
01:09:03,325 --> 01:09:07,285
Speaker 7:  kind of heavy and the mounts are pretty cheap. Plastic. So I was a

1115
01:09:07,285 --> 01:09:11,245
Speaker 7:  little bit worried about how well it was gonna mount stably to the

1116
01:09:11,245 --> 01:09:13,165
Speaker 7:  dashboard, but I gave it a shot.

1117
01:09:15,615 --> 01:09:18,565
Speaker 12:  Let's figure out where to put this thing.

1118
01:09:20,505 --> 01:09:23,925
Speaker 7:  One tricky thing for me was just figuring out where to put it.

1119
01:09:24,315 --> 01:09:28,205
Speaker 7:  Like my Prius has a screen and I need that for

1120
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:31,965
Speaker 7:  the existing backup camera and for AC and for

1121
01:09:31,975 --> 01:09:35,965
Speaker 7:  other stuff that I don't have physical buttons for. So it needs to be

1122
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:39,805
Speaker 7:  a second screen that I put on the dash somewhere that is not gonna

1123
01:09:39,805 --> 01:09:43,605
Speaker 7:  block my view of the road or my view of the speedometer, et cetera, et cetera.

1124
01:09:44,615 --> 01:09:48,175
Speaker 7:  Mounting itself turned out to be fine. The suction and the

1125
01:09:48,175 --> 01:09:51,975
Speaker 7:  adhesive worked out well, and once I turned the car

1126
01:09:52,035 --> 01:09:54,655
Speaker 7:  on the screen worked fine.

1127
01:09:55,605 --> 01:09:57,135
Speaker 12:  Okay, it's turning on.

1128
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:03,095
Speaker 12:  I've got options for CarPlay Android Auto phone link and audio

1129
01:10:03,155 --> 01:10:03,575
Speaker 12:  output

1130
01:10:04,945 --> 01:10:08,815
Speaker 7:  Setup was really easy. It was reasonably bright

1131
01:10:08,835 --> 01:10:12,695
Speaker 7:  and responsive. I don't know, it was a little laggy, a little bit washed

1132
01:10:12,695 --> 01:10:16,575
Speaker 7:  out. But again, $37. And for what it's

1133
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:19,535
Speaker 7:  worth, it is a ton better than my existing Prius screen

1134
01:10:20,765 --> 01:10:24,295
Speaker 13:  Head south on 30th Avenue, Southwest towards Southwest Cambridge

1135
01:10:24,295 --> 01:10:28,255
Speaker 7:  Street. I drove around with it for a while and I don't know, it

1136
01:10:28,275 --> 01:10:32,215
Speaker 7:  did all the CarPlay things. Google Maps is amazing on a much

1137
01:10:32,215 --> 01:10:36,175
Speaker 7:  larger screen. If you're used to a phone that's in a holster on your dashboard,

1138
01:10:36,835 --> 01:10:40,015
Speaker 7:  it was easy to see texts when I was parked. There's a lot of little perks

1139
01:10:40,015 --> 01:10:43,535
Speaker 7:  to it. Audio was a little bit more complicated.

1140
01:10:44,155 --> 01:10:47,775
Speaker 7:  It comes with a bunch of options to send audio. One,

1141
01:10:47,775 --> 01:10:51,415
Speaker 7:  there's a standard ox jack, which for me means a long

1142
01:10:51,605 --> 01:10:55,255
Speaker 7:  awkward snaking cable to the port in my car. You can use

1143
01:10:55,255 --> 01:10:58,935
Speaker 7:  Bluetooth, which is just horrible on my Prius. So that's a no.

1144
01:10:59,595 --> 01:11:03,255
Speaker 7:  You can send audio to FM radio, which I kind of love

1145
01:11:03,395 --> 01:11:07,295
Speaker 7:  and is an amazing throwback. Or it does have an internal

1146
01:11:07,295 --> 01:11:10,895
Speaker 7:  speaker, which is crappy, but it's actually fine for

1147
01:11:10,895 --> 01:11:13,885
Speaker 7:  directions if that's the only thing you need the audio for. And the

1148
01:11:13,885 --> 01:11:16,445
Speaker 13:  Light turn right onto 26th Avenue Southwest.

1149
01:11:17,665 --> 01:11:20,685
Speaker 7:  And by the way, If, you ever wanted to know what The Vergecast would sound

1150
01:11:20,685 --> 01:11:22,605
Speaker 7:  like on FM radio? Here you go.

1151
01:11:25,595 --> 01:11:29,365
Speaker 15:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Quantified REM

1152
01:11:29,365 --> 01:11:29,725
Speaker 15:  cycles.

1153
01:11:30,465 --> 01:11:34,445
Speaker 7:  So like I said, I drove around for an afternoon with it and

1154
01:11:34,445 --> 01:11:38,285
Speaker 7:  there were things I struggled with, but they don't actually have much to

1155
01:11:38,285 --> 01:11:41,805
Speaker 7:  do with the device itself. The screen is cheap, but it's

1156
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:45,885
Speaker 7:  functional. But a couple things stood out. The first thing is to get the

1157
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:49,125
Speaker 7:  most out of it, I would need to install it on my dashboard.

1158
01:11:49,705 --> 01:11:53,605
Speaker 7:  And then I'd need to snake the power to the cigarette lighter in

1159
01:11:53,625 --> 01:11:57,525
Speaker 7:  one part of the car, and then snake the audio cable to the UX port

1160
01:11:57,665 --> 01:12:01,445
Speaker 7:  in another part of the car. And if I wanted the backup camera, I'd have to

1161
01:12:01,445 --> 01:12:05,245
Speaker 7:  wire that to the brake light and to the screen. It's all

1162
01:12:05,245 --> 01:12:08,925
Speaker 7:  just a lot of cable management. Like you're putting a

1163
01:12:08,925 --> 01:12:12,725
Speaker 7:  screen in the car where there wasn't one, or in my case, finding a place

1164
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:16,525
Speaker 7:  for a second screen, which is all doable, but it's not

1165
01:12:16,525 --> 01:12:20,045
Speaker 7:  something that tiktoks show you. 'cause you know they're all trying to sell

1166
01:12:20,045 --> 01:12:22,805
Speaker 7:  you this thing. Like if I did a TikTok review,

1167
01:12:23,585 --> 01:12:27,085
Speaker 7:  100% of it would just be really awkward cable management.

1168
01:12:28,315 --> 01:12:32,295
Speaker 7:  And then the other thing that I realized all at once as I was driving

1169
01:12:32,295 --> 01:12:35,855
Speaker 7:  down the street is that, oh wait, I live in a neighborhood

1170
01:12:35,945 --> 01:12:39,895
Speaker 7:  where car break-ins happen kind of a lot. And I

1171
01:12:39,895 --> 01:12:43,855
Speaker 7:  now have what looks like an iPad mini just sitting on my dashboard at all

1172
01:12:43,855 --> 01:12:47,815
Speaker 7:  times. Like this thing 100% is gonna get stolen at some point,

1173
01:12:48,465 --> 01:12:52,335
Speaker 7:  which again, is not a knock on the screen itself and it might not be a

1174
01:12:52,335 --> 01:12:56,255
Speaker 7:  concern for you where you live, but it's kind of a deal breaker for

1175
01:12:56,255 --> 01:12:59,695
Speaker 7:  me 'cause there's no way this thing is worth a broken window. So

1176
01:13:00,445 --> 01:13:04,085
Speaker 7:  Sean, what are we to make of this thing? Well,

1177
01:13:04,465 --> 01:13:08,005
Speaker 7:  at a really basic level, it does what it claims to do.

1178
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:12,765
Speaker 7:  I don't know how long it will last. It's certainly really cheap, but

1179
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:16,965
Speaker 7:  it all works. It gives you CarPlay in your car, If, you didn't have it before

1180
01:13:17,465 --> 01:13:21,285
Speaker 7:  and the rest of it is just up to you to make work with your car.

1181
01:13:22,425 --> 01:13:26,005
Speaker 7:  For me, I've always been jealous of people with CarPlay,

1182
01:13:26,745 --> 01:13:30,685
Speaker 7:  but now I'm faced with this question, is this actually better

1183
01:13:30,685 --> 01:13:34,645
Speaker 7:  than just putting my phone in a holster on the dashboard? And I

1184
01:13:34,645 --> 01:13:38,485
Speaker 7:  think my answer is no, honestly, but your answer

1185
01:13:38,485 --> 01:13:39,005
Speaker 7:  might be different.

1186
01:13:41,835 --> 01:13:44,885
Speaker 2:  Alright, right. That is it for The Vergecast today. Thank you to everyone
