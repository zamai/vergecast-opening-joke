00:00:02,515 --> 00:00:06,445
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Spatial Computing. I'm

3
00:00:06,445 --> 00:00:10,325
Speaker 2:  your friend, David Pierce, and I am in Bora Bora. I mean, no, I'm not. I'm

4
00:00:10,325 --> 00:00:14,125
Speaker 2:  in my basement where I always am, but I'm in the Apple Vision Pro in

5
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:17,565
Speaker 2:  one of the immersive environments. and what I've discovered about this thing

6
00:00:17,825 --> 00:00:21,685
Speaker 2:  is that obviously You can turn the Vision Pro all the way down and

7
00:00:21,705 --> 00:00:25,125
Speaker 2:  see your actual surroundings through pass through, or You can turn it all

8
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,405
Speaker 2:  the way up with the digital crown and be in sort of a pure VR

9
00:00:28,515 --> 00:00:32,485
Speaker 2:  environment. But I like to turn on one of the environments, but only to like

10
00:00:32,775 --> 00:00:36,405
Speaker 2:  60%. and what that means now is as I'm looking forward

11
00:00:36,555 --> 00:00:40,525
Speaker 2:  here, I'm seeing my Mac Monitor because I think that's how most people

12
00:00:40,825 --> 00:00:44,365
Speaker 2:  use their Vision Pro is as a monitor for their Mac plus a couple of Vision

13
00:00:44,425 --> 00:00:48,365
Speaker 2:  Pro apps that I've aligned around. And it looks like I'm on

14
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:51,605
Speaker 2:  the beach, right? I'm in a lounge chair on the beach in Bora Bora. It's delightful.

15
00:00:51,705 --> 00:00:55,605
Speaker 2:  But then if I look off to the side or I look behind me, or

16
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:59,765
Speaker 2:  I even look kind of down at my desk, I can see my actual

17
00:01:00,165 --> 00:01:02,885
Speaker 2:  surroundings. And that's usually what I need to be able to see in a glance

18
00:01:02,885 --> 00:01:05,965
Speaker 2:  anyway. Like the dog comes charging down the hallway. I need to be able to

19
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:08,925
Speaker 2:  look and see the dog charging down the hallway. But normally if I'm just

20
00:01:08,925 --> 00:01:12,805
Speaker 2:  looking forward, I get this lovely serene beach environment. It's

21
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:16,725
Speaker 2:  delightful and I can do it from my basement. It actually like, it feels so

22
00:01:16,725 --> 00:01:20,325
Speaker 2:  silly to talk about this, but it's kind of great. Anyway, the Vision Pro

23
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:24,565
Speaker 2:  is what I wanna talk about on the show today. So five months ago today,

24
00:01:24,905 --> 00:01:28,565
Speaker 2:  as you're listening to this, on Tuesday, July 2nd, was

25
00:01:28,705 --> 00:01:32,125
Speaker 2:  the launch of The Vision Pro. February 2nd, 2024. That was when it shipped.

26
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:35,885
Speaker 2:  And regular people started getting to use it. And I thought this might be

27
00:01:35,885 --> 00:01:38,965
Speaker 2:  a good time to just do a check-in. It's been five months. We've heard a lot

28
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,605
Speaker 2:  about new software, we've heard a lot about new hardware developers have

29
00:01:41,605 --> 00:01:45,085
Speaker 2:  gotten a chance to do it. People have gotten to spend real time messing around

30
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:47,965
Speaker 2:  in this thing. I think the novelty is worn off in a way that's actually really

31
00:01:48,185 --> 00:01:52,045
Speaker 2:  useful. We can just talk about this thing. So that's what we're gonna do.

32
00:01:52,415 --> 00:01:56,165
Speaker 2:  We're gonna talk about what we've been up to in this headset for the last

33
00:01:56,165 --> 00:01:59,045
Speaker 2:  few months. We're gonna talk to some developers about what they've been up

34
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:02,645
Speaker 2:  to. We're gonna talk about where all of this is headed. Lots to do. I think

35
00:02:02,645 --> 00:02:06,525
Speaker 2:  The Vision Pro has sort of been through the hype cycle and really

36
00:02:06,575 --> 00:02:10,125
Speaker 2:  we've all, in a certain way, kind of forgotten about it. Honestly, it was

37
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:13,965
Speaker 2:  not a huge hit. It didn't change the world, but I feel like there's

38
00:02:13,965 --> 00:02:16,605
Speaker 2:  still a lot to talk about here. So that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna

39
00:02:16,605 --> 00:02:20,565
Speaker 2:  talk about it. All of that is coming up in just a second. But first,

40
00:02:21,085 --> 00:02:24,765
Speaker 2:  I have to go and fix my hair because dear Lord, you use this thing for 10

41
00:02:24,765 --> 00:02:28,045
Speaker 2:  minutes and your hair looks ridiculous and we just can't have that. Lots

42
00:02:28,045 --> 00:02:30,965
Speaker 2:  of Vision, Pro, isn stuff to do. This is The Vergecast. We'll be right back.

43
00:03:46,385 --> 00:03:50,145
Speaker 2:  heard a lot about other headsets and glasses, sorts of devices.

44
00:03:50,325 --> 00:03:54,145
Speaker 2:  The RayBan Meta Smart Glasses have been a huge hit, which I think is a really

45
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:57,785
Speaker 2:  interesting part of the Vision Pro story. There's just a lot going on. This

46
00:03:57,785 --> 00:04:01,545
Speaker 2:  gadget is five months old, which is brand new and also in a certain way,

47
00:04:01,815 --> 00:04:05,625
Speaker 2:  kind of old in the way the tech news world works. But there's still

48
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,985
Speaker 2:  a lot happening. and it feels like whatever is gonna happen here is very

49
00:04:08,985 --> 00:04:12,825
Speaker 2:  early. But I wanted to get some perspective from people who frankly have

50
00:04:12,825 --> 00:04:16,545
Speaker 2:  used this thing more than I have. So I grabbed two of the folks at The

51
00:04:16,665 --> 00:04:20,265
Speaker 2:  Verge who have the most Vision Pro experience, and that is Wes Davis

52
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:24,505
Speaker 2:  and Vs. Song. They have spent many more hours goofing around at this

53
00:04:24,505 --> 00:04:27,905
Speaker 2:  thing, testing it, using it in their own lives than I have. And so I thought

54
00:04:27,905 --> 00:04:31,025
Speaker 2:  I'd grab them to talk about what they've seen so far, how they've used it,

55
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:34,985
Speaker 2:  whether they would continue to use it over time, and

56
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:38,985
Speaker 2:  where it seems like all of this might go next. So let's just get into it.

57
00:04:39,485 --> 00:04:43,465
Speaker 2:  Wes Davis. Welcome To. The Vergecast. Yes. Hello. Good to be here. Vong,

58
00:04:43,465 --> 00:04:44,705
Speaker 2:  welcome back. Thank

59
00:04:44,705 --> 00:04:45,465
Speaker 3:  You for having me.

60
00:04:45,845 --> 00:04:49,505
Speaker 2:  So I wanted to talk to you because you're, you're two of the Vision

61
00:04:49,885 --> 00:04:53,825
Speaker 2:  Pro isn people at The Verge, which is, I would say is kind of a dubious

62
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:57,225
Speaker 2:  distinction at this moment in time. Agreed. But let's just, let's just talk

63
00:04:57,225 --> 00:05:01,105
Speaker 2:  about how you're both using the Vision Pro. And Wes, I wanna start with you

64
00:05:01,945 --> 00:05:05,305
Speaker 2:  because unlike V and Me, you paid the hard earned

65
00:05:05,565 --> 00:05:09,505
Speaker 2:  actual human dollars for your Vision Pro. I'm still

66
00:05:09,505 --> 00:05:13,265
Speaker 2:  paying money for it. I did the bought it with installment

67
00:05:13,265 --> 00:05:16,985
Speaker 2:  payments through my Apple card, so I'll be paying for it

68
00:05:17,085 --> 00:05:21,065
Speaker 2:  for some time. Oh no. So when you bought one, what did you buy it for?

69
00:05:21,065 --> 00:05:24,625
Speaker 2:  What did you think you were getting? I knew that I was getting a product

70
00:05:24,815 --> 00:05:28,745
Speaker 2:  that isn't fully fletched. I knew it was going to

71
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,705
Speaker 2:  be basically a, you know, like a tech demo product. I

72
00:05:32,705 --> 00:05:36,345
Speaker 2:  had read the review, I knew the shortcomings, I knew what I was

73
00:05:36,455 --> 00:05:40,265
Speaker 2:  getting into. I think to be completely transparent, like the reason

74
00:05:40,385 --> 00:05:44,185
Speaker 2:  I wanted to get it is because I hadn't really used a

75
00:05:44,325 --> 00:05:48,105
Speaker 2:  VR thing since the virtual boy, like n Nintendo's,

76
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:52,385
Speaker 2:  you know, it's been a minute drastic failure. Like I had played

77
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:55,145
Speaker 2:  with other people's stuff, but I hadn't owned one. You know what I mean?

78
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:59,485
Speaker 2:  So I kind of wanted to see where, I guess

79
00:05:59,585 --> 00:06:03,085
Speaker 2:  not just where things are, but kind of where they're going, right? Because

80
00:06:03,085 --> 00:06:06,885
Speaker 2:  this is like, it's a little bit ahead of, its, time is not the right word,

81
00:06:06,885 --> 00:06:10,805
Speaker 2:  right? But like, but it's, you know, it's ambitious. The, the

82
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:14,605
Speaker 2:  tech is pretty ahead as far as like visual clarity

83
00:06:14,825 --> 00:06:18,485
Speaker 2:  and, and all that stuff. The screen's a really high resolution. And

84
00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:22,765
Speaker 2:  did you have a thing that you were like, okay, even if it's

85
00:06:23,205 --> 00:06:26,285
Speaker 2:  terrible at everything, at least it'll do this one thing for me and that'll

86
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:29,125
Speaker 2:  make it worth it. Did you have one of those in your mind that you're like,

87
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:33,045
Speaker 2:  if only it's X, yeah, I can live with this purchase? Not

88
00:06:33,045 --> 00:06:36,885
Speaker 2:  really. I was intrigued by the whole, like, let's

89
00:06:36,885 --> 00:06:40,685
Speaker 2:  put a big virtual screen in front of me thing. I have since found out that,

90
00:06:40,685 --> 00:06:44,045
Speaker 2:  that it's nice for certain things, but

91
00:06:44,745 --> 00:06:48,325
Speaker 2:  it does also do things like when you have a gigantic display in front of

92
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,965
Speaker 2:  you, I've never used on a regular basis

93
00:06:52,115 --> 00:06:55,405
Speaker 2:  more than like a 27 inch screen. But when you have a gigantic

94
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:59,685
Speaker 2:  screen, like blow it up to, you know, the size of a huge HD TV V

95
00:06:59,705 --> 00:07:03,325
Speaker 2:  or projector or whatever, you will miss notifications because

96
00:07:03,475 --> 00:07:07,405
Speaker 2:  like really on Mac Os, they're all just in the top right. And when,

97
00:07:07,435 --> 00:07:11,165
Speaker 2:  when the top right is five miles away from you, you don't see them.

98
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:14,445
Speaker 2:  You mean like literally in your eyesight? Like, yeah, yeah. The screen is

99
00:07:14,445 --> 00:07:16,845
Speaker 2:  so large. Yeah. Okay. So I don't do that.

100
00:07:17,365 --> 00:07:21,205
Speaker 4:  I feel like I have the exact opposite, really. Experience with that. Yeah.

101
00:07:21,445 --> 00:07:25,125
Speaker 4:  I just feel like I see everything all at once. I just become

102
00:07:25,605 --> 00:07:27,605
Speaker 4:  Michelle, yo everything everywhere, all

103
00:07:27,605 --> 00:07:27,885
Speaker 2:  At once.

104
00:07:28,105 --> 00:07:28,885
Speaker 4:  And I have the power.

105
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:30,005
Speaker 2:  You have fingers.

106
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:34,045
Speaker 4:  Yeah, with hot dog fingers, or it feels like hotdog finger.

107
00:07:34,065 --> 00:07:37,205
Speaker 4:  It might as well be hotdog fingers. Just 'cause like, I have a lot of problem

108
00:07:37,235 --> 00:07:40,805
Speaker 4:  with it, recognizing my finger gestures. I don't, I have feel like I, every

109
00:07:40,805 --> 00:07:44,685
Speaker 4:  single time, every so often, I have to recalibrate using it. So yes, truly,

110
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,565
Speaker 4:  I just become Michelle, Leo.

111
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:51,485
Speaker 2:  I mean, there are worse things to become, right? Yeah. It's, it's in certain

112
00:07:51,515 --> 00:07:55,405
Speaker 2:  ways that's the dream. And in other ways, less so. But v

113
00:07:55,405 --> 00:07:59,125
Speaker 2:  what about you? You, you, you acquired this thing basically from Neli. You

114
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,165
Speaker 2:  stole it from him like eight minutes after we published our review in January.

115
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,365
Speaker 2:  Why did you, why did you want to have this thing around?

116
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:09,045
Speaker 4:  Basically one, you wear it the wearables lady. So

117
00:08:09,045 --> 00:08:12,885
Speaker 4:  that is, it is like, it is a category of wearables and one that

118
00:08:13,085 --> 00:08:16,965
Speaker 4:  I, you know, I like emerging tech a lot, so I'm just curious about it because

119
00:08:17,025 --> 00:08:20,965
Speaker 4:  it also, I wanted to see how it stacks up to the

120
00:08:20,965 --> 00:08:24,565
Speaker 4:  idea of smart glasses and just kind of, I feel like it's part

121
00:08:24,745 --> 00:08:28,085
Speaker 4:  way on the evolution to that. So I just really wanted to kind of

122
00:08:28,705 --> 00:08:32,365
Speaker 4:  dig into it. and it wasn't what I expected in many ways.

123
00:08:33,235 --> 00:08:37,125
Speaker 4:  Like, I, I don't, I think I was expecting something different than a VR headset,

124
00:08:37,195 --> 00:08:41,125
Speaker 4:  even though everyone had said it's, it's just essentially a VR headset and

125
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:45,085
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Yeah. and it, it is a VR headset. It's slightly different though. It's

126
00:08:45,085 --> 00:08:49,045
Speaker 4:  very, it's very Apple is what I'll say when I'm in it. I also have

127
00:08:49,505 --> 00:08:53,485
Speaker 4:  the me Quest three. Yeah. The, the most recent one I have

128
00:08:53,485 --> 00:08:56,725
Speaker 4:  that. So I kind of go back and forth, forth in between them sometimes, and

129
00:08:56,755 --> 00:09:00,125
Speaker 4:  it's just, they're the same, but it's like the same thing written in different

130
00:09:00,335 --> 00:09:04,325
Speaker 4:  fonts. But one of those fonts is comic sands, and the other is like,

131
00:09:05,165 --> 00:09:06,685
Speaker 4:  I don't know what the hypno font is

132
00:09:06,795 --> 00:09:08,405
Speaker 2:  Anymore. It's

133
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:12,085
Speaker 4:  Comic sands, but what is that? Oh, okay. Yeah. So it's comic sands. So it's

134
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:15,925
Speaker 4:  just very, I'll let people wonder which one I think is comic sense

135
00:09:15,945 --> 00:09:17,725
Speaker 4:  and which one I think is the hyp new font.

136
00:09:18,005 --> 00:09:20,685
Speaker 2:  I feel like it's very obvious, but that's, yeah. Well, it's good. We'll,

137
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:24,245
Speaker 2:  we'll leave it mysterious for you. So, okay, so fast forward to now, and

138
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:28,085
Speaker 2:  Wes, I'm, I'm curious for you two, what do you do when you put on the headset?

139
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:30,645
Speaker 2:  Like, I feel like we've, it's been long enough. Part of the reason I wanted

140
00:09:30,645 --> 00:09:34,245
Speaker 2:  to do this now is it's been long enough that the, like, I wonder what this

141
00:09:34,245 --> 00:09:38,125
Speaker 2:  is and how it'll work. Is this anything? I would assume that's

142
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:41,725
Speaker 2:  worn off by now. And now it's like, you don't quite have the like, oh my

143
00:09:41,725 --> 00:09:45,565
Speaker 2:  God, every time you put it on, or the like, ugh, this sucks every time

144
00:09:45,565 --> 00:09:48,005
Speaker 2:  the battery dies. So you're like, you're in a space where You can actually

145
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:51,445
Speaker 2:  kind of use it as a person. How do you use the Vision Pro now

146
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:55,445
Speaker 2:  just for cooking? No, I, I use it.

147
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:57,965
Speaker 2:  I was about to be like, that is the most

148
00:09:58,245 --> 00:10:00,005
Speaker 4:  Exciting answer. I believed you for a

149
00:10:00,005 --> 00:10:03,805
Speaker 2:  Second. I tried it once after reading those Joanna Sterns review, right?

150
00:10:03,805 --> 00:10:07,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah, yeah. Joanna Stern's story. But it's horrible for that. Don't

151
00:10:07,685 --> 00:10:08,965
Speaker 2:  use it for cooking. Not a good cook.

152
00:10:09,145 --> 00:10:12,285
Speaker 4:  We were FaceTiming while you were cooking that one time. Were did

153
00:10:12,285 --> 00:10:13,885
Speaker 2:  We? Okay. I forgot that I,

154
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:17,605
Speaker 4:  We were FaceTiming in the Vision Pro while you were cooking. That was an

155
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:18,485
Speaker 4:  experience watching you,

156
00:10:18,545 --> 00:10:22,205
Speaker 2:  It was a bad idea. That was something, yeah, don't, not safe.

157
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:25,965
Speaker 2:  No, mostly. So I will use it

158
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:29,685
Speaker 2:  one or two times a week while I'm working.

159
00:10:30,395 --> 00:10:34,165
Speaker 2:  Usually it's like, if I really want to focus on a,

160
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:38,485
Speaker 2:  something specific, if I'm working on, on, you know, a bigger piece or

161
00:10:39,335 --> 00:10:43,205
Speaker 2:  every now and then, I just, just to try it just to see. But I, I,

162
00:10:43,385 --> 00:10:46,925
Speaker 2:  I'm a three monitor guy, which is stupid, but I am,

163
00:10:47,195 --> 00:10:50,965
Speaker 2:  I've gotten used to it. And so when I have just the one monitor, I'm like,

164
00:10:51,465 --> 00:10:54,485
Speaker 2:  now all my stuff's on top of each other. I can't just look over, I can't

165
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:58,365
Speaker 2:  put all my apps on all the screens. So there's that. I use it a

166
00:10:58,835 --> 00:11:02,765
Speaker 2:  fair amount actually, to watch stuff I've been catching up on for

167
00:11:02,765 --> 00:11:06,565
Speaker 2:  all mankind, which I never watched before this year. So

168
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:10,005
Speaker 2:  I've been watching that a bunch. Every now and then I'll think like, hey,

169
00:11:10,195 --> 00:11:13,485
Speaker 2:  like this is basically a movie theater on my face.

170
00:11:14,065 --> 00:11:18,045
Speaker 2:  So like, are there old movies that I never got to see in theater?

171
00:11:18,065 --> 00:11:22,045
Speaker 2:  Things that I missed? So I'll, I'll do that sometimes. So you use it as

172
00:11:22,045 --> 00:11:25,925
Speaker 2:  like a single tasking device. Yeah. And as a, I'm, I'm

173
00:11:26,165 --> 00:11:28,525
Speaker 2:  fascinated by this idea that you're like, I have too many screens and when

174
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:32,445
Speaker 2:  I need to focus I put on a headset. Yeah. Which on one hand sounds

175
00:11:32,465 --> 00:11:35,925
Speaker 2:  so counterintuitive, but it's also a thing I've actually heard a few times

176
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:38,845
Speaker 2:  from folks that it is like, it is a surprisingly useful

177
00:11:40,135 --> 00:11:44,005
Speaker 2:  focus device. Like why does it work for you? That's harder to

178
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:47,805
Speaker 2:  explain. I think it's, it's sort of that it zeroes me

179
00:11:47,825 --> 00:11:51,085
Speaker 2:  in. So it's like when I put it on, it's like I get to go into

180
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:55,885
Speaker 2:  like mentally into a mode where I'm like, like, this is the thing that I'm

181
00:11:55,885 --> 00:11:59,725
Speaker 2:  doing right now, is working on whatever this task is. I,

182
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:03,485
Speaker 2:  I don't know. It's, it's helpful. I like it for that. Is it worth

183
00:12:03,485 --> 00:12:07,445
Speaker 2:  $3,500 to do that when I could also just get

184
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:11,365
Speaker 2:  my laptop and like, go do that exact same

185
00:12:11,485 --> 00:12:15,325
Speaker 2:  thing? I, I'm not sure. Although, you know, my laptop is like a tiny

186
00:12:15,325 --> 00:12:19,165
Speaker 2:  little rectangle and this lets me, as I said earlier,

187
00:12:19,475 --> 00:12:23,365
Speaker 2:  have a, you know, 500 mile wide screen. So yeah,

188
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:27,325
Speaker 2:  it is a very funny thing that like years ago I had a coworker who had a

189
00:12:27,325 --> 00:12:31,165
Speaker 2:  Chromebook that he had rigged up to not run anything other than

190
00:12:31,165 --> 00:12:34,605
Speaker 2:  Google Docs. And he was just like, this is my, this is my typewriter, right?

191
00:12:34,605 --> 00:12:37,685
Speaker 2:  Like, I sit here when I just need to write things and, and like, do you have

192
00:12:37,685 --> 00:12:40,925
Speaker 2:  a hundred other devices that will also run Google Docs? Yes, of course. Absolutely.

193
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:44,925
Speaker 2:  But there was something about that space that just felt sort of better and

194
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:48,925
Speaker 2:  saner and more focused to him. But you hear about writers, right? Like

195
00:12:48,925 --> 00:12:52,885
Speaker 2:  yeah, who keep around like Old Max or whatever. Like

196
00:12:52,885 --> 00:12:53,685
Speaker 2:  for the same reason

197
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:56,525
Speaker 4:  George R. Martin still mad at him.

198
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,925
Speaker 2:  That's funny. Like, I'm sure part of that is just like, this is the comfortable

199
00:12:59,925 --> 00:13:03,405
Speaker 2:  thing that I've been writing my novels on for, you know, decades. I'm not

200
00:13:03,405 --> 00:13:07,365
Speaker 2:  gonna give it up until, you know, it completely dies or whatever.

201
00:13:07,465 --> 00:13:10,605
Speaker 2:  But v what about you? What has been sticky for you over time?

202
00:13:11,405 --> 00:13:15,045
Speaker 4:  Actually, kind of very similar to Wes, when I really need to focus on a draft,

203
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:19,565
Speaker 4:  like really just, I have a lot of little focus tools on my regular

204
00:13:19,695 --> 00:13:23,045
Speaker 4:  thing because breaking out the Vision Pro, it has to be really

205
00:13:23,075 --> 00:13:27,005
Speaker 4:  intentional for me just because I have really bad eyes. So if I'm

206
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:30,605
Speaker 4:  wearing glasses, I don't have the zes inserts, so I have to be like, okay,

207
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:33,165
Speaker 4:  it's time for me to go upstairs and put my contacts in.

208
00:13:33,225 --> 00:13:36,725
Speaker 2:  Oh wow. Yeah. It's like a several step process for you just to be like, it's

209
00:13:37,065 --> 00:13:39,445
Speaker 2:  i's several step. I'm, I'm gonna open up Google Docs in the headset now.

210
00:13:39,715 --> 00:13:43,605
Speaker 4:  Yeah. But I actually think that the most useful thing for me has

211
00:13:43,635 --> 00:13:47,565
Speaker 4:  been actually having a 500 foot Google Docs

212
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:51,045
Speaker 4:  in front of me just to like really zero in on the words.

213
00:13:51,805 --> 00:13:55,325
Speaker 4:  And actually I write mostly in the CMS. So sometimes it's just

214
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:59,365
Speaker 4:  the CMS just in front of me with the chaos. Like, just, just

215
00:13:59,365 --> 00:14:03,325
Speaker 4:  really impressing upon me the importance of finishing this draft.

216
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,205
Speaker 2:  Literally the stuff of nightmares.

217
00:14:05,205 --> 00:14:08,205
Speaker 4:  Yeah. It's a giant nightmare screen and or you know,

218
00:14:09,105 --> 00:14:12,325
Speaker 4:  you know, sometimes I'll watch stuff on there. 'cause I really do think it's

219
00:14:12,595 --> 00:14:16,485
Speaker 4:  like best when you're using it as a screen. It kind of isn't as good

220
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:20,085
Speaker 4:  in my opinion, when you're using it for the way that I think Apple wants

221
00:14:20,105 --> 00:14:23,885
Speaker 4:  you to use it. It's really just like having an

222
00:14:23,885 --> 00:14:27,765
Speaker 4:  amazingly large screen in front of you. And my problem

223
00:14:27,765 --> 00:14:31,445
Speaker 4:  though, with watching content is the platform of content.

224
00:14:31,635 --> 00:14:35,565
Speaker 4:  Like I think if you have something that you wanna watch on Disney Plus,

225
00:14:35,565 --> 00:14:38,525
Speaker 4:  or the stuff that's, or Apple TV plus that's integrated, oh yeah, that's

226
00:14:38,525 --> 00:14:42,445
Speaker 4:  super easy. But I wanna watch my KDRs because my husband

227
00:14:42,535 --> 00:14:46,245
Speaker 4:  won't watch KDRs with me. And this is a solitary experience.

228
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:50,965
Speaker 4:  So, you know, going to my crappy streaming Kdr

229
00:14:51,845 --> 00:14:55,605
Speaker 4:  websites where everything is like a one second away from getting

230
00:14:55,675 --> 00:14:59,605
Speaker 4:  malware, it ECTs it into my Vision pro. That's kind of not quite

231
00:14:59,605 --> 00:15:03,325
Speaker 4:  so easy. And then when you do watch it sometimes, like I did watch a little

232
00:15:03,325 --> 00:15:06,965
Speaker 4:  bit of bridgeton through going to Netflix in

233
00:15:07,205 --> 00:15:11,125
Speaker 4:  Safari and in the thing, I was just like, wow, this is

234
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,645
Speaker 4:  too overwhelming. There's just so much happening.

235
00:15:14,825 --> 00:15:18,445
Speaker 4:  You'll like, I don't, I don't know that I feel quite

236
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:22,525
Speaker 4:  as enamored with it, like a few months on as like a watching

237
00:15:22,525 --> 00:15:26,245
Speaker 4:  medium because I do wanna, I do wanna like text crayons who's the one

238
00:15:26,545 --> 00:15:29,685
Speaker 4:  use the sole reason why I watch Bridgeton and be like, oh my God, the men

239
00:15:29,685 --> 00:15:33,445
Speaker 4:  on this show are stupid. They just need to talk about their feelings. And

240
00:15:33,445 --> 00:15:36,325
Speaker 4:  like, you know, it's so easy when you're just on a TV and You can just pull

241
00:15:36,325 --> 00:15:40,245
Speaker 4:  out your phone and be like, oh, Simon is stupid in Bridgeton. I can't really

242
00:15:40,245 --> 00:15:43,885
Speaker 4:  do that. I have to hold my thoughts and then, then like, tell people afterwards.

243
00:15:44,045 --> 00:15:47,805
Speaker 4:  'cause I could type in Yeah, you just in in the, the actual,

244
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:51,285
Speaker 4:  yeah, but it's stupid 'cause you have like one finger and typing. Unless

245
00:15:51,425 --> 00:15:54,805
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna, what am I gonna do? Get up from my very comfy daybed and then

246
00:15:55,715 --> 00:15:59,565
Speaker 4:  type into my computer so that Yeah, no, with

247
00:15:59,565 --> 00:16:03,285
Speaker 4:  the, my keyboard just to, to message someone more clearly. Eh, it's, it's,

248
00:16:03,285 --> 00:16:05,445
Speaker 4:  it's not quite as intuitive. You

249
00:16:05,445 --> 00:16:09,005
Speaker 2:  Guys are talking about this sort of singletasking thing. Do you do this in

250
00:16:09,585 --> 00:16:13,485
Speaker 2:  the like immersive environments, VR headset style? Or do you just sit in

251
00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:15,085
Speaker 2:  your own living room with a gigantic screen?

252
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:18,885
Speaker 4:  I, I sit on the moon. I love this. I sit on the moon just because I'm just

253
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:22,645
Speaker 4:  like, it's, it's goodbye everybody. Every once in a while, my, every once

254
00:16:22,645 --> 00:16:26,485
Speaker 4:  in a while my cat will just like start touching me while I'm on the

255
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,365
Speaker 4:  moon and that kind of takes me out of the

256
00:16:28,365 --> 00:16:32,085
Speaker 2:  Moon. That is a real thing. Like, cat jumping

257
00:16:32,185 --> 00:16:36,085
Speaker 2:  on you while you're immersed. I'm sorry, I just used that

258
00:16:36,085 --> 00:16:40,045
Speaker 2:  term, but while you have that turned on Yeah. Cat jumping on

259
00:16:40,045 --> 00:16:43,685
Speaker 2:  you. Although I will say that my cat,

260
00:16:44,105 --> 00:16:48,005
Speaker 2:  one of his favorite things to do and it feels very intentional, is to jump

261
00:16:48,005 --> 00:16:51,845
Speaker 2:  in my lap while I'm, you know, holding my phone or my tablet or

262
00:16:52,605 --> 00:16:56,485
Speaker 2:  whatever and be in the way of that. Like, it, it's, oh, absolutely

263
00:16:56,505 --> 00:17:00,125
Speaker 2:  not. Yeah. And he can't do that when I'm using

264
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:03,805
Speaker 2:  Vision Pro. He has to wedge himself between your thumb and your, your

265
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:06,365
Speaker 2:  index finger and that's, that's the hook. Yeah. And sometimes he'll kind

266
00:17:06,365 --> 00:17:09,965
Speaker 2:  of like flash, like I'll see little ears flashing into the screen.

267
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:14,125
Speaker 2:  But as far as like using the immersive stuff, if

268
00:17:14,145 --> 00:17:17,805
Speaker 2:  I'm trying to type it's, I don't know, like trying to find the

269
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:22,045
Speaker 2:  keyboard is really annoying now. They fixed that in Vision OS two. So if

270
00:17:22,045 --> 00:17:25,965
Speaker 2:  you have the beta You can You can do that and it will recognize a magic

271
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:29,965
Speaker 2:  keyboard. They say that it's just for magic keyboards. I've gotten

272
00:17:30,065 --> 00:17:34,045
Speaker 2:  it to recognize this NES controller that I have as a keyboard

273
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:37,565
Speaker 2:  for, for just a few minutes and it would kind of show it when I look down

274
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:41,565
Speaker 2:  at it again and then it stopped, it figured out I was lying. So I love that

275
00:17:41,565 --> 00:17:45,085
Speaker 2:  the pro tip is just fooling the vision pro. Yeah, that's a good strategy.

276
00:17:45,725 --> 00:17:49,245
Speaker 2:  Absolutely. But no, you're, you're getting ahead of me on some of the software

277
00:17:49,245 --> 00:17:51,285
Speaker 2:  stuff, but one of the things I've heard a bunch of people talking about is

278
00:17:51,515 --> 00:17:55,205
Speaker 2:  that the phone mirroring thing inside of Mac

279
00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:58,925
Speaker 2:  Os inside of the Vision Pro could be a big deal

280
00:17:59,505 --> 00:18:02,325
Speaker 2:  for solving kind of both the problems you're talking about, right? Like the,

281
00:18:02,345 --> 00:18:05,885
Speaker 2:  the Yeah. How do I input while I'm in this space and

282
00:18:06,845 --> 00:18:10,485
Speaker 2:  v like the thing you're describing, which I call like light multitasking

283
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:13,605
Speaker 2:  is a thing I have thought so much about with the Vision Pro because like,

284
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:16,565
Speaker 2:  I love going to movie theaters. I go to movie theaters alone all the time

285
00:18:16,565 --> 00:18:20,325
Speaker 2:  to see movies just because I'm not allowed to use my phone. It is the best.

286
00:18:20,585 --> 00:18:22,805
Speaker 2:  And it's just like, I'm gonna sit here, I'm gonna watch this whole movie

287
00:18:23,595 --> 00:18:27,565
Speaker 2:  like a maniac, right? Like I'm gonna just look at the movie the

288
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,285
Speaker 2:  whole time. And, and there is something about the Vision Pro that is really

289
00:18:30,285 --> 00:18:34,125
Speaker 2:  compelling in that way. I found, especially in like the good

290
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:37,845
Speaker 2:  streaming apps and really it's basically like Disney and like

291
00:18:37,945 --> 00:18:41,285
Speaker 2:  Max a little and that's kind of it. Apple TV's good, but there aren't many.

292
00:18:41,345 --> 00:18:45,165
Speaker 2:  But the ones that are good I have found, I actually like really enjoy watching

293
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,645
Speaker 2:  stuff in. But v I'm with you. Like, if it's a matter of loading up a browser,

294
00:18:48,865 --> 00:18:52,165
Speaker 2:  it just, that doesn't, at that point I'm like, this is worse than watching

295
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:53,605
Speaker 2:  on my television. What am I doing here?

296
00:18:54,165 --> 00:18:57,805
Speaker 4:  I wish all the stuff that I wanted to watch on my own was in the good apps,

297
00:18:57,905 --> 00:19:01,005
Speaker 4:  but they're not. Yeah. Which is kind of, you know, the whole thing about

298
00:19:01,005 --> 00:19:04,565
Speaker 4:  the loneliness in the Vision Pro. It's, it's a real, I think that's like

299
00:19:04,565 --> 00:19:08,405
Speaker 4:  my biggest problem with it is that I would enjoy it so much more

300
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:12,005
Speaker 4:  if I had more people to hang out with in there.

301
00:19:12,395 --> 00:19:15,845
Speaker 4:  Otherwise, yeah. Otherwise I'm just kind of like, eh,

302
00:19:16,925 --> 00:19:18,885
Speaker 4:  everyone's out here. Who am I gonna,

303
00:19:19,315 --> 00:19:22,605
Speaker 2:  That tension sort of both sides of that. I I was one of the things I wanted

304
00:19:22,605 --> 00:19:25,365
Speaker 2:  to ask you both about, because you both live in households with other people

305
00:19:25,985 --> 00:19:29,925
Speaker 2:  and also are like big nerds who are online talking to people all

306
00:19:29,925 --> 00:19:33,685
Speaker 2:  the time. For me as a person in a, in a household with other people, I cannot

307
00:19:33,735 --> 00:19:37,565
Speaker 2:  bring myself to wear this around other people. Like, and it, that's probably

308
00:19:37,565 --> 00:19:40,965
Speaker 2:  just a me thing. Maybe I'll get over it. But I'm curious what your experience

309
00:19:40,965 --> 00:19:44,525
Speaker 2:  has been like. Like do you sit on the couch around your, your partner,

310
00:19:44,545 --> 00:19:46,725
Speaker 2:  family, friends, whoever and what?

311
00:19:47,325 --> 00:19:50,925
Speaker 4:  I have been roasted within an inch of my life

312
00:19:50,925 --> 00:19:54,805
Speaker 4:  wearing that thing. I actually wore it in a car one time just

313
00:19:54,805 --> 00:19:58,725
Speaker 4:  to test the truffle mode. I was not driving, oh. Just to be clear, I was

314
00:19:58,725 --> 00:20:02,565
Speaker 4:  not driving. I was the passenger and that was just, that was

315
00:20:02,565 --> 00:20:06,165
Speaker 4:  not fun. The the, the windows were, it was,

316
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:09,405
Speaker 4:  it was trying to fight me the entire time. 'cause I think it knew that I

317
00:20:09,405 --> 00:20:12,925
Speaker 4:  wasn't supposed to be in a car with that thing. But when I was testing it

318
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:16,845
Speaker 4:  more frequently, my spouse would walk by, would just look at me and go, oh,

319
00:20:17,395 --> 00:20:19,845
Speaker 4:  I'll talk to you when you're a human again. Oh.

320
00:20:19,905 --> 00:20:20,325
Speaker 2:  Oh, interesting.

321
00:20:20,435 --> 00:20:24,205
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Okay. Bye. Like n no. Or

322
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:28,085
Speaker 4:  he would go, that is just so cursed because you have the eyesight

323
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:31,765
Speaker 4:  on the other side and he's just like, that's not, that's not your eyes. That's

324
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:32,485
Speaker 4:  just, Hmm.

325
00:20:33,435 --> 00:20:37,405
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Eyesight's not the solution. It's just not,

326
00:20:37,765 --> 00:20:40,325
Speaker 4:  I get why they did it. I get why they did it. I think it's actually like

327
00:20:40,395 --> 00:20:44,045
Speaker 4:  very oddly human and thoughtful why they did that. Right?

328
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,365
Speaker 4:  'cause eye contact is so, they're actually like talking about the social

329
00:20:47,595 --> 00:20:51,085
Speaker 4:  cues with, by creating that particular feature. But

330
00:20:51,885 --> 00:20:55,805
Speaker 4:  I have not, I have never had a single person go, wow, that's so cool.

331
00:20:56,025 --> 00:20:59,845
Speaker 4:  Can I try it? I've been like, delighted. 'cause most of the people in my

332
00:20:59,845 --> 00:21:03,165
Speaker 4:  life are not huge tech nerd. Like my husband's just,

333
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:07,365
Speaker 4:  they, he gets so mad seeing it and he's like, why do you have this thing?

334
00:21:07,605 --> 00:21:11,245
Speaker 4:  What is the purpose of this? What is the pur? Meanwhile

335
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:15,205
Speaker 4:  they love, they love the Meadow RayBan glasses. Like they, they

336
00:21:15,215 --> 00:21:18,445
Speaker 4:  can't stop using them, but they look at me and the Vision pro and they're

337
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:21,325
Speaker 4:  like, why? Humanity is like, yeah.

338
00:21:22,025 --> 00:21:26,005
Speaker 2:  The one thing that I do kind of in like the common space in

339
00:21:26,005 --> 00:21:29,805
Speaker 2:  the, in the living room is I will go in there because it's the one room

340
00:21:29,805 --> 00:21:33,685
Speaker 2:  that's bright enough and big enough in my house where I can

341
00:21:33,995 --> 00:21:37,805
Speaker 2:  play games on it. Which like, I don't do a lot of,

342
00:21:38,345 --> 00:21:42,085
Speaker 2:  but there, there is one rhythm game, which called synth writers

343
00:21:42,985 --> 00:21:46,805
Speaker 2:  and it's basically beat saber, right? Kind of. It's like you have

344
00:21:46,815 --> 00:21:50,485
Speaker 2:  balls flying at you and you have to catch them in time with the music or

345
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:54,645
Speaker 2:  whatever. It's stupid. But it's also, I enjoy

346
00:21:54,645 --> 00:21:58,245
Speaker 2:  it. Those games are very fun and, and the good news is you look so cool doing

347
00:21:58,265 --> 00:22:02,245
Speaker 2:  it. You look very cool. Cool. Yeah. And so like every now and

348
00:22:02,245 --> 00:22:05,725
Speaker 2:  then, like my, my wife will come downstairs and

349
00:22:05,955 --> 00:22:09,485
Speaker 2:  walk in and I'm just standing there like doing like all these

350
00:22:09,615 --> 00:22:13,245
Speaker 2:  weird movements, waving my arms around and stuff. But

351
00:22:14,025 --> 00:22:17,885
Speaker 2:  she also has played it and has fun with it. She never asks to play,

352
00:22:17,985 --> 00:22:21,885
Speaker 2:  but if I'm playing and I'm like, do you want to do the thing? And, and then

353
00:22:21,985 --> 00:22:25,885
Speaker 2:  she, you know, often will take me up on it because she

354
00:22:25,915 --> 00:22:29,885
Speaker 2:  also secretly thinks it's fun. But her reaction, she's

355
00:22:29,885 --> 00:22:33,845
Speaker 2:  not as angry I think as or or upset

356
00:22:33,865 --> 00:22:37,685
Speaker 2:  by it. She's not offended by it. She's just like, she'll come in and and

357
00:22:37,685 --> 00:22:41,645
Speaker 2:  just be like, oh look, it's my robot husband. Yeah. I think the, I'll talk

358
00:22:41,645 --> 00:22:44,965
Speaker 2:  to you when you're done in there. Yeah. Reaction is so

359
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:49,445
Speaker 2:  common and so fascinating because that is like 100% the, the precise

360
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:53,365
Speaker 2:  thing that Apple was trying to solve. Right? This thing where like, I,

361
00:22:53,585 --> 00:22:56,965
Speaker 2:  and they did so many interesting technical things to make it work. Like the,

362
00:22:57,225 --> 00:23:00,845
Speaker 2:  the thing where a person sort of fades into your view as you come in, like

363
00:23:01,435 --> 00:23:04,725
Speaker 2:  technically incredible. It works shockingly well.

364
00:23:05,195 --> 00:23:08,885
Speaker 2:  It's only alarming, at least for me the first couple of times like, it, it

365
00:23:08,885 --> 00:23:11,605
Speaker 2:  freaked me out pretty legitimately the first couple of times and then I got

366
00:23:11,605 --> 00:23:14,685
Speaker 2:  used to it. But it doesn't, it it fixes the problem for you

367
00:23:15,425 --> 00:23:18,685
Speaker 2:  as the wearer a little bit. But I've had the exact same reaction every time

368
00:23:18,685 --> 00:23:21,285
Speaker 2:  I've been ringing around somebody else that like, as soon as they see me

369
00:23:21,285 --> 00:23:25,085
Speaker 2:  in the headset, it's like, oh, we're not interacting. Like we can't, you're

370
00:23:25,085 --> 00:23:28,605
Speaker 2:  somewhere else. I can't, You can, even if You can see me, even if You can

371
00:23:28,605 --> 00:23:31,805
Speaker 2:  see the space you are somewhere else. We are not going to talk. I wonder

372
00:23:31,865 --> 00:23:35,205
Speaker 2:  if that's because eyesight itself is the problem

373
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:38,925
Speaker 2:  or if it's because it's just not bright and high fidelity enough. Because

374
00:23:39,025 --> 00:23:41,645
Speaker 2:  you know, when you look at it, it looks like a, like a, like you're looking

375
00:23:41,645 --> 00:23:45,045
Speaker 2:  at one of those hologram cards of, of somebody's like,

376
00:23:45,665 --> 00:23:47,165
Speaker 2:  you know, eyeballs. I think that's

377
00:23:47,675 --> 00:23:51,365
Speaker 4:  Part of it. And just like the uncannyness of it. Sure. At the same time.

378
00:23:51,395 --> 00:23:55,165
Speaker 4:  Yeah, just like that really. 'cause you know, like it, it kind of, you see

379
00:23:55,165 --> 00:23:59,005
Speaker 4:  the eyes but it's like, there's like tinge, there's a tinge with blue

380
00:23:59,165 --> 00:24:02,085
Speaker 4:  I think. Yeah. If you're in an app so they know that your full focus isn't

381
00:24:02,085 --> 00:24:05,965
Speaker 4:  there. But unless you sit down with someone and explain to them what that

382
00:24:05,965 --> 00:24:09,765
Speaker 4:  means and they're aware of what those cues are, I think just people

383
00:24:09,785 --> 00:24:13,645
Speaker 4:  are gonna look at that and just go like, Uhuh. Yeah, there's gonna do a big

384
00:24:14,075 --> 00:24:16,325
Speaker 4:  Brendan Frazier and the Mummy just going Uhuh.

385
00:24:16,985 --> 00:24:19,765
Speaker 2:  So let's, let's talk about like where we go next, right? Because I think

386
00:24:19,765 --> 00:24:23,565
Speaker 2:  it is, it is, we're five months in. This thing is brand new. Like every time

387
00:24:23,605 --> 00:24:26,085
Speaker 2:  I talk to people who love the Vision Pro, they're like, what about the iPhone

388
00:24:26,085 --> 00:24:29,765
Speaker 2:  after five months? And like that's true. It's none of it. None of it was

389
00:24:29,765 --> 00:24:33,725
Speaker 2:  any good after five months. So like it's fine. Sure. But Wes, you've

390
00:24:33,725 --> 00:24:37,565
Speaker 2:  been writing a bunch about Vision OS two, which I think my read on Vision

391
00:24:37,745 --> 00:24:41,685
Speaker 2:  OS two is basically like, this is now fixing

392
00:24:41,825 --> 00:24:45,685
Speaker 2:  all the sort of table stakes stuff. It's basically Vision OS

393
00:24:45,705 --> 00:24:49,285
Speaker 2:  one. Now what in there are you excited about? Gimme the rundown. So the thing

394
00:24:49,305 --> 00:24:53,085
Speaker 2:  I'm, I'm most excited about is the big curve display thing

395
00:24:53,945 --> 00:24:57,445
Speaker 2:  for the reasons I mentioned earlier. Just not having all the space that I'm

396
00:24:57,445 --> 00:25:00,805
Speaker 2:  used to. And it's weirdly like a lot of the

397
00:25:01,065 --> 00:25:04,765
Speaker 2:  things that they brought in for this version are things

398
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:08,525
Speaker 2:  that I like, had thought specifically that I

399
00:25:08,525 --> 00:25:12,285
Speaker 2:  wanted. And a curved display was like, I had thought like,

400
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:16,245
Speaker 2:  you know, we all, well not we all, but a lot of people were saying in forums

401
00:25:16,245 --> 00:25:19,925
Speaker 2:  and stuff, like we want multiple displays and the Vision Pro, why aren't

402
00:25:19,925 --> 00:25:23,365
Speaker 2:  there multiple displays? And one day I was thinking like, why, why do we

403
00:25:23,365 --> 00:25:26,925
Speaker 2:  need multiple displays? It's a virtual environment. Why can't you just have

404
00:25:27,005 --> 00:25:30,845
Speaker 2:  a big, you know, a big long display or whatever. And then they

405
00:25:30,845 --> 00:25:33,965
Speaker 2:  announced that and I didn't expect that. Like I, I thought it was gonna be

406
00:25:34,005 --> 00:25:37,565
Speaker 2:  a multiple display thing, but like why not? Why not have a big curve

407
00:25:37,565 --> 00:25:41,125
Speaker 2:  display thing? Another thing that that I had

408
00:25:41,305 --> 00:25:44,925
Speaker 2:  really wanted was some better ways to get to things

409
00:25:45,345 --> 00:25:48,365
Speaker 2:  in, in the Vision Pro. So like launching the,

410
00:25:48,805 --> 00:25:52,605
Speaker 2:  launching your apps for instance, like the home screen before

411
00:25:52,605 --> 00:25:56,365
Speaker 2:  your two options were to reach up and push the little button on the top,

412
00:25:56,365 --> 00:26:00,125
Speaker 2:  the digital ground. Or you could go into the control center by

413
00:26:00,355 --> 00:26:04,085
Speaker 2:  looking up, hoping you get the little dot, tapping the dot. I hate that

414
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:08,005
Speaker 2:  so much. Yeah. That whole process, it's like a three step process now.

415
00:26:08,425 --> 00:26:12,285
Speaker 2:  You just like do this funky like little flourish with your

416
00:26:12,285 --> 00:26:16,125
Speaker 2:  hand and I love it. It is like a little, it's it's the very end of a magic

417
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:19,645
Speaker 2:  trick kind of vibe. Yeah, it is. You're just like, you, you flourish your

418
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:23,205
Speaker 2:  hand. Yeah. And there's a little dot that shows up right here. It's

419
00:26:23,495 --> 00:26:27,045
Speaker 2:  shows up pretty reliably and then you tap your fingers together and you've

420
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:30,605
Speaker 2:  got your home screen. It's easy. And then while you're doing that, if you

421
00:26:30,675 --> 00:26:34,645
Speaker 2:  want to quickly check the time or the battery, which is

422
00:26:34,645 --> 00:26:38,325
Speaker 2:  like not a thing You can do normally. I mean You can by

423
00:26:38,495 --> 00:26:42,205
Speaker 2:  again looking up and finding the dot. But it's not, I don't know, it's not

424
00:26:42,265 --> 00:26:46,005
Speaker 2:  as, somehow it's different than this motion, which is just like

425
00:26:46,005 --> 00:26:49,845
Speaker 2:  turning your hand over. And I kind of likened it when I

426
00:26:49,845 --> 00:26:53,365
Speaker 2:  wrote about it before to, to being like turning your hand to look at your

427
00:26:53,735 --> 00:26:57,205
Speaker 2:  wrist to see what time it is. I don't know if that's what they were going

428
00:26:57,265 --> 00:27:01,205
Speaker 2:  for, but it's what I immediately thought and they, you know, that,

429
00:27:01,435 --> 00:27:05,005
Speaker 2:  that seems aply right? To kind of think about it that way.

430
00:27:05,305 --> 00:27:09,285
Speaker 2:  And that will show you the time, the battery level and You can tap there

431
00:27:09,345 --> 00:27:13,005
Speaker 2:  to get to the control center or You can tap and hold to like change the volume,

432
00:27:13,255 --> 00:27:17,045
Speaker 2:  stuff like that. Just bringing in easy quick gestures

433
00:27:17,145 --> 00:27:21,125
Speaker 2:  to do stuff inside of the

434
00:27:21,125 --> 00:27:24,805
Speaker 2:  Vision Pro, get to menus and and all that stuff instead of having to go through

435
00:27:24,805 --> 00:27:28,525
Speaker 2:  all this rigamarole. I would love it if there was like a way to get to settings

436
00:27:28,705 --> 00:27:32,525
Speaker 2:  for instance, that way too. Because this being a new product,

437
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:37,125
Speaker 2:  I'm still, you know, months later constantly going and and

438
00:27:37,725 --> 00:27:41,565
Speaker 2:  changing settings. Right? Just tweaking little things. And I do

439
00:27:41,565 --> 00:27:45,365
Speaker 2:  that anyway on all of my devices. But you know, it's just, it's more

440
00:27:45,565 --> 00:27:48,685
Speaker 2:  pronounced on the Vision Pro. How often do you guys use Siri on the Vision

441
00:27:48,705 --> 00:27:52,165
Speaker 2:  Pro? Because I feel like my answer to all of the weird UI stuff is I just

442
00:27:52,165 --> 00:27:55,605
Speaker 2:  yell at Siri. I use Siri three times as much on the Vision Pro is on any

443
00:27:55,605 --> 00:27:59,485
Speaker 2:  other Apple device. I am surrounded by home pots. Oh, fair enough.

444
00:28:00,705 --> 00:28:04,685
Speaker 2:  And phones and all kinds of things. I do use it and it does

445
00:28:04,835 --> 00:28:08,645
Speaker 2:  seem to prioritize the Vision Pro, but my

446
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:12,485
Speaker 2:  experience over the last several years of using like the

447
00:28:12,485 --> 00:28:16,085
Speaker 2:  Apple Home stuff has been that like, while it has

448
00:28:16,365 --> 00:28:19,085
Speaker 2:  improved, it's still frequently enough

449
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:23,885
Speaker 2:  misunderstands Siri still sucks is what you're saying. Siri. Like

450
00:28:24,005 --> 00:28:27,605
Speaker 2:  I, my phone is not like, still doesn't have Siri turned on

451
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:30,525
Speaker 2:  because of that. Like, if I want Siri on my phone, same, I will press the

452
00:28:30,525 --> 00:28:30,685
Speaker 2:  button.

453
00:28:31,205 --> 00:28:34,725
Speaker 4:  I use Siri most while driving. And even then half the time when I'm driving

454
00:28:34,835 --> 00:28:38,765
Speaker 4:  it's like, no, that's not what I asked. Oh my God, stop. And some of that

455
00:28:38,765 --> 00:28:42,685
Speaker 4:  is just me. Like I have to, I have to like know what I wanna ask and how

456
00:28:42,725 --> 00:28:46,285
Speaker 4:  I wanna ask it in a way that the voice assistant is gonna understand.

457
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:50,605
Speaker 4:  And I'm not too good at that because I just word vomit half the time

458
00:28:50,715 --> 00:28:54,405
Speaker 4:  what I want. So it's not like a coherent sentence. I feel like you have to

459
00:28:54,405 --> 00:28:58,325
Speaker 4:  say, you know, Siri. See, I don't even know what to

460
00:28:58,325 --> 00:29:01,765
Speaker 4:  say in a fake Siri prompt besides like setting

461
00:29:01,945 --> 00:29:05,165
Speaker 4:  timers before that. I'm just like, it's like Siri and then my brain like

462
00:29:05,165 --> 00:29:07,645
Speaker 4:  buffers. I'm like, what do I want her to do? How should I say that? That

463
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:09,405
Speaker 2:  Brain Buffer thing is real. Oh yeah. Yeah.

464
00:29:09,405 --> 00:29:13,325
Speaker 4:  It's like, that's my main issue with it and it's why I don't, but it's

465
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:17,405
Speaker 4:  frustrating 'cause when I'm in there and I am on Safari and I'm, you know,

466
00:29:17,405 --> 00:29:21,165
Speaker 4:  trying to type, I go like, oh, it would be so much easier if I could just

467
00:29:21,165 --> 00:29:25,085
Speaker 4:  talk to, to Siri and do it and then I'll look at the microphone and

468
00:29:25,085 --> 00:29:28,565
Speaker 4:  try and tap. Yeah. and it just not working. And so then I just give up and

469
00:29:28,565 --> 00:29:30,645
Speaker 4:  then I, and yeah, so that's, that's my

470
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:34,485
Speaker 2:  Issue. I will say though, like, yeah to your point David, like opening

471
00:29:34,515 --> 00:29:38,485
Speaker 2:  apps that way is actually like, I, I do do that somewhat frequently.

472
00:29:38,905 --> 00:29:42,525
Speaker 2:  The part of the reason that I don't is because I'm always

473
00:29:42,525 --> 00:29:46,285
Speaker 2:  forgetting the name of Vision Pro apps. Mm. 'cause they have weird names

474
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:50,045
Speaker 2:  sometimes. And then other times it's like until recently until Vision

475
00:29:50,145 --> 00:29:53,845
Speaker 2:  OS two you couldn't rearrange the home apps and now You can. That's another

476
00:29:53,845 --> 00:29:57,765
Speaker 2:  thing I'm excited about. I guess like, I don't know, like it feels

477
00:29:57,765 --> 00:30:01,525
Speaker 2:  weird to say I'm excited about that so much of Vision OS two is like,

478
00:30:01,865 --> 00:30:05,405
Speaker 2:  now You can copy and paste on the iPhone, right? It's like, yeah, okay great.

479
00:30:05,755 --> 00:30:09,405
Speaker 2:  That is good and useful and hooray and also Absolutely. How on earth did

480
00:30:09,405 --> 00:30:13,365
Speaker 2:  this not exist until now? Yeah. And you still can't, like, as far as I

481
00:30:13,365 --> 00:30:17,325
Speaker 2:  know and v if you've figured out how to do this, but I don't think You can

482
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:22,005
Speaker 2:  make folders in inside the home. There is a folder

483
00:30:22,105 --> 00:30:25,965
Speaker 2:  for iPad apps that's already there. Right. And you have to use it like

484
00:30:25,965 --> 00:30:29,765
Speaker 2:  it came with Vision Os but you can't make more. And that drives me

485
00:30:29,765 --> 00:30:33,525
Speaker 2:  nuts because like, I don't like, like on my iPhone, I have it

486
00:30:33,675 --> 00:30:37,645
Speaker 2:  very intentionally set up where most of my apps live in

487
00:30:37,645 --> 00:30:41,605
Speaker 2:  the library and only a few are actually on my home screen

488
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:45,405
Speaker 2:  in any way. And it's organized so that I only

489
00:30:45,405 --> 00:30:49,325
Speaker 2:  have the things that like, that I use regularly.

490
00:30:49,425 --> 00:30:52,965
Speaker 2:  So like my podcast app is there and my books app,

491
00:30:53,295 --> 00:30:57,245
Speaker 2:  stuff like that. Otherwise it's like everything else is shoved over in the

492
00:30:57,245 --> 00:31:00,885
Speaker 2:  app library. I will search for it when I want it. I don't want it there.

493
00:31:00,915 --> 00:31:04,445
Speaker 2:  Like I don't want TikTok on my home screen being like, do you wanna watch

494
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:04,885
Speaker 2:  some videos?

495
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:06,925
Speaker 4:  How responsible of you.

496
00:31:08,265 --> 00:31:11,365
Speaker 2:  But like with the Vision Pro, you can't do that. There's no app library.

497
00:31:11,585 --> 00:31:15,085
Speaker 2:  It is the app library. It, it's very old school

498
00:31:15,305 --> 00:31:19,045
Speaker 2:  iPhone in that way. It's just pages and pages of apps and

499
00:31:19,535 --> 00:31:22,885
Speaker 2:  thankfully You can re rearrange them, but that's annoying too. This

500
00:31:22,945 --> 00:31:26,525
Speaker 4:  The whole app experience in the Vision Pro has been annoying. How so? Like

501
00:31:26,805 --> 00:31:30,285
Speaker 4:  downloading them, it takes forever to download something. Like, it just,

502
00:31:30,585 --> 00:31:34,485
Speaker 4:  you're just waiting and then by the time it's downloaded, I forget that

503
00:31:34,485 --> 00:31:38,205
Speaker 4:  it's there. So it takes me a while to go back and find the new app

504
00:31:38,265 --> 00:31:42,245
Speaker 4:  or something. And like with Wes said, it's just like having to find stuff

505
00:31:42,245 --> 00:31:46,125
Speaker 4:  like I'm, I'm, I don't know. It's, it's, it's just easier to

506
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:50,085
Speaker 4:  do it on my phone sometimes. And then sometimes the apps that are

507
00:31:50,085 --> 00:31:53,885
Speaker 4:  in there, I I am just like that this, this is, this was not

508
00:31:53,885 --> 00:31:57,725
Speaker 4:  what I was promised. I was in the Zillow app in there and it's not, that's

509
00:31:57,725 --> 00:32:01,045
Speaker 4:  not what I wanted from a Zillow app on the Vision Pro.

510
00:32:01,605 --> 00:32:04,965
Speaker 2:  I wanna talk about the Zillow app in a minute, but I'm curious. V can you

511
00:32:05,285 --> 00:32:07,805
Speaker 2:  actually read your phone? Because I'm want, like I can't.

512
00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:11,685
Speaker 4:  No. Okay. Like, I mean, I could, if I s like I have really bad eyes. Like

513
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:15,125
Speaker 4:  I don't know if this is useful because my eyesight is garbage, but like I

514
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:19,005
Speaker 4:  have tried looking at my phone and it's just kind of, I have to squint and

515
00:32:19,025 --> 00:32:22,765
Speaker 4:  I'm already like, so my eyes are already dry in the Vision pro

516
00:32:22,765 --> 00:32:26,405
Speaker 4:  because my eyes are so wide on the inside and like I'm wearing contacts,

517
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:29,685
Speaker 4:  which is extra drying and so then I have to squint really hard to look at

518
00:32:29,905 --> 00:32:33,725
Speaker 4:  my phone. So it's just not worth it really. Yeah. And I still can't wear

519
00:32:33,725 --> 00:32:37,605
Speaker 4:  it for very long at a time. Like I, I I think Wes you said

520
00:32:37,605 --> 00:32:41,245
Speaker 4:  you figured out how to wear it for like two plus hours. Like I, I have to

521
00:32:41,245 --> 00:32:44,925
Speaker 4:  tap out after an hour. Like, it doesn't matter how I

522
00:32:44,925 --> 00:32:48,645
Speaker 4:  arrange it on my head, it doesn't matter what strap I'm using, just after

523
00:32:48,765 --> 00:32:51,725
Speaker 4:  a while I really feel it. So I kind of have to take it off.

524
00:32:52,105 --> 00:32:55,005
Speaker 2:  And it's not that way for me every time. Most of the time I can

525
00:32:55,405 --> 00:32:59,365
Speaker 2:  legitimately get away with wearing it for an hour or two hours. I've,

526
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:03,165
Speaker 2:  I've gone even longer than that. Not all day, or at least I haven't tried

527
00:33:03,165 --> 00:33:07,005
Speaker 2:  it all day. It took a while to get to that. Like it took a lot of fiddling

528
00:33:07,005 --> 00:33:10,645
Speaker 2:  with the strap. Like I still, I still use

529
00:33:10,785 --> 00:33:14,605
Speaker 2:  the solo thing. I tried the other, the one that's supposed to be the

530
00:33:14,605 --> 00:33:18,365
Speaker 2:  comfortable one for a while and it made the top of my head numb and

531
00:33:18,675 --> 00:33:22,205
Speaker 2:  that bothered me. So, so I switched back and I figured out a way to make

532
00:33:22,205 --> 00:33:26,165
Speaker 2:  it work. But I think you've written about this the

533
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:30,805
Speaker 2:  just about like how personal wearables are, right? Yeah.

534
00:33:30,905 --> 00:33:34,805
Speaker 2:  And now like, like especially with like, with like smart

535
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:38,445
Speaker 2:  rings and stuff like that, just every, every single

536
00:33:38,445 --> 00:33:42,405
Speaker 2:  person's body is different and you know, I might be able to

537
00:33:42,405 --> 00:33:46,245
Speaker 2:  wear the vision pro all day, maybe who knows why. Maybe, maybe

538
00:33:46,365 --> 00:33:49,365
Speaker 2:  I have like an extra fat forehead or something and it's just got a lot of

539
00:33:49,365 --> 00:33:53,205
Speaker 2:  padding there. I don't know. We had Parker, who's our, our product person,

540
00:33:53,315 --> 00:33:57,085
Speaker 2:  like went through hell to get that thing, to like to fit his

541
00:33:57,085 --> 00:34:01,005
Speaker 2:  face. Yeah. Whereas me, I got lucky, but it, it took a while. Like

542
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:04,645
Speaker 2:  at first it was like, you know, it would press too hard here or press too

543
00:34:04,645 --> 00:34:08,525
Speaker 2:  hard here or it felt heavy. My neck hurt from wearing

544
00:34:08,585 --> 00:34:12,405
Speaker 2:  the thing. I don't know if I just have an extra strong, like back of

545
00:34:12,405 --> 00:34:16,205
Speaker 2:  my neck now or, or what, but like most of those issues are gone.

546
00:34:16,685 --> 00:34:20,645
Speaker 4:  I actually will lie down wearing it. Yeah. If I try to, if I

547
00:34:20,645 --> 00:34:24,485
Speaker 4:  have to wear it for a longer period of time because it just like relieves

548
00:34:24,485 --> 00:34:28,285
Speaker 4:  the pressure from the top of my head and like the tightness around it, I,

549
00:34:28,395 --> 00:34:32,365
Speaker 4:  it's, I have flat cheekbones so you know, there's

550
00:34:32,365 --> 00:34:36,245
Speaker 4:  no actual bone support to lift this thing, so I

551
00:34:36,245 --> 00:34:39,525
Speaker 4:  have to like tighten it around my face. And so I think that's part of the

552
00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:43,285
Speaker 4:  reason why I have no, like, I have no bone structure with which

553
00:34:43,345 --> 00:34:46,605
Speaker 4:  to hold this thing up. And that is like a thing with wearables, like your

554
00:34:46,635 --> 00:34:49,885
Speaker 4:  face, everybody's face is gonna be structured differently. And like with

555
00:34:49,885 --> 00:34:53,325
Speaker 4:  the glasses, it's, it's the nose bridge again. I have a flat face, I have

556
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:56,645
Speaker 4:  a flat nose bridge. I have nothing to hold these things up. So if there's

557
00:34:56,645 --> 00:35:00,405
Speaker 4:  no supportive structure in there, I, it just slides down my face all the

558
00:35:00,405 --> 00:35:04,325
Speaker 4:  time. So I don't have a face made to wear it comfortably, but I

559
00:35:04,345 --> 00:35:06,365
Speaker 4:  do so for the blog. So

560
00:35:06,795 --> 00:35:10,365
Speaker 2:  It's important to sacrifice sacrifices. Yeah. As, as somebody with very good

561
00:35:10,365 --> 00:35:14,325
Speaker 2:  vision and ample nose. I suppose the

562
00:35:14,325 --> 00:35:18,245
Speaker 2:  thing that always gets me is just like my, my eyes

563
00:35:18,345 --> 00:35:22,165
Speaker 2:  get tired at the end of it. And wes like, that's the thing that is most

564
00:35:22,165 --> 00:35:26,125
Speaker 2:  surprising to me. Like I can fight through the, you know, my head

565
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,525
Speaker 2:  hurts thing. Like do you guys ever see the tiktoks of the people who have

566
00:35:28,525 --> 00:35:31,365
Speaker 2:  the, the dent in their, he from wearing headphones all the time? Yeah. But

567
00:35:31,665 --> 00:35:34,605
Speaker 2:  I'm convinced the Vision Pro isn gonna end up doing that to me. But I can

568
00:35:34,605 --> 00:35:38,365
Speaker 2:  soldier through all of that, but I get like physically exhausted

569
00:35:38,395 --> 00:35:41,525
Speaker 2:  just from looking at this stuff all the time. And I think to some extent

570
00:35:41,525 --> 00:35:44,445
Speaker 2:  that's just like, it's just the light in your eyes all the time. Like if

571
00:35:44,445 --> 00:35:47,325
Speaker 2:  I sat close to my tv, watched it for hours at a time, it

572
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:51,165
Speaker 4:  No, no, no. I actually talked to ophthalmologist, it's on The Verge dot com

573
00:35:51,165 --> 00:35:55,005
Speaker 4:  about is it dangerous to have a screen that close to your face? And the answer

574
00:35:55,145 --> 00:35:59,005
Speaker 4:  is not really the, like that's a myth about having the screen so

575
00:35:59,005 --> 00:36:02,645
Speaker 4:  close to your eyes. It's actually that your eyes are just open for too long.

576
00:36:02,645 --> 00:36:06,085
Speaker 4:  You're not blinking as much. Oh, interesting. So your eyes become less hydrated

577
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:10,125
Speaker 4:  and that's can, that can cause like burst blood vessels in your eyes.

578
00:36:10,565 --> 00:36:12,165
Speaker 4:  It's, it's benign generally.

579
00:36:12,565 --> 00:36:16,405
Speaker 2:  I had a friend in high school who used to play doom so

580
00:36:16,405 --> 00:36:20,005
Speaker 2:  much that he would come to school with burst blood vessels in his eyes because

581
00:36:20,005 --> 00:36:22,845
Speaker 2:  he would forget to blink for hours at a time. Shout out to him.

582
00:36:23,185 --> 00:36:26,765
Speaker 4:  So you do, you do need to be putting the eyedrops in your eyes if you're

583
00:36:26,765 --> 00:36:30,645
Speaker 4:  prone to, prone to dry eye. And it's like also again, with me, with

584
00:36:30,645 --> 00:36:34,445
Speaker 4:  my contacts, contacts are drying. So because the the,

585
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:38,485
Speaker 4:  the display is so stimulating, you're just gonna blink less. You're not gonna

586
00:36:38,485 --> 00:36:42,005
Speaker 4:  be blinking normally as you would in there. So that, I do think that the

587
00:36:42,005 --> 00:36:45,725
Speaker 4:  eye fatigue is a thing that we haven't necessarily talked about because you

588
00:36:45,725 --> 00:36:49,205
Speaker 4:  know, you're in an immersive environment every so often. Are you gonna hit

589
00:36:49,205 --> 00:36:53,045
Speaker 4:  pause to like just open, oh like take off the

590
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:55,445
Speaker 4:  thing, squirt in some eyedrops and then put it,

591
00:36:55,645 --> 00:36:58,125
Speaker 2:  You should build that into the vision pro. It's like the opposite of the

592
00:36:58,125 --> 00:37:01,365
Speaker 2:  thing in the watch that expels the water. It just flushes water into your

593
00:37:01,365 --> 00:37:02,605
Speaker 2:  eyes every 20 minutes. So just

594
00:37:02,605 --> 00:37:05,645
Speaker 4:  Flush water and choose the saline solution because I, you know, that is eye

595
00:37:05,645 --> 00:37:09,525
Speaker 4:  hygiene. There there is like, like good health and good practices

596
00:37:09,525 --> 00:37:12,925
Speaker 4:  that you have to use with these devices that we don't always do. So like

597
00:37:12,925 --> 00:37:16,285
Speaker 4:  the screen distance, like talk to actual ophthalmologists. The screen distance

598
00:37:16,285 --> 00:37:19,765
Speaker 4:  is not the problem. It is the fact that you are not blinking that can cause

599
00:37:20,145 --> 00:37:23,885
Speaker 4:  actual eye strain and that's not great for you. So it's,

600
00:37:23,885 --> 00:37:27,565
Speaker 4:  there's, they said 20 20, 20 every 20 seconds. Look 20 feet away

601
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:27,965
Speaker 4:  for

602
00:37:29,645 --> 00:37:33,365
Speaker 4:  I think 20 seconds. Every 20 minutes. Look 20 feet away for 20 seconds. That's

603
00:37:33,365 --> 00:37:35,365
Speaker 4:  what it is. But you can't do that in a vision pro,

604
00:37:35,575 --> 00:37:39,045
Speaker 2:  Right? 'cause it's all an inch and a half away. It's fair.

605
00:37:40,005 --> 00:37:43,845
Speaker 2:  I do have to say one thing that I thought of earlier. I, right

606
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:47,805
Speaker 2:  now I'm, I I I'm building a bicycle from a frame,

607
00:37:47,805 --> 00:37:51,645
Speaker 2:  that old frame that I had and I realized I didn't have

608
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:54,725
Speaker 2:  the measurement of something and I don't own calipers. There's an app in

609
00:37:54,725 --> 00:37:58,005
Speaker 2:  the Vision Pro called Hand calipers. There you go. Did you put,

610
00:37:58,065 --> 00:38:00,365
Speaker 4:  Did you put calipers on in virtual reality?

611
00:38:00,505 --> 00:38:04,405
Speaker 2:  The, you don't put them on, you hold your fingers up and two little dots

612
00:38:04,405 --> 00:38:08,245
Speaker 2:  show up and it shows the measurement between your fingers and it's

613
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:11,885
Speaker 2:  delightful. And I used it and it gave me an accurate measurement.

614
00:38:12,025 --> 00:38:14,965
Speaker 2:  And that's all I want to say. They are going to make a Vision Pro commercial

615
00:38:15,015 --> 00:38:18,365
Speaker 2:  about you tomorrow. Yeah. I hope they do.

616
00:38:18,365 --> 00:38:22,005
Speaker 4:  Somewhere, somewhere the vision of Vision Pro team, someone's screaming with

617
00:38:22,065 --> 00:38:24,485
Speaker 4:  Joy saying yes, they used it the way I want.

618
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:27,885
Speaker 2:  Oh, it's nobody on the Vision Pro team. It's just some guy who made me up

619
00:38:28,185 --> 00:38:31,285
Speaker 2:  as far as I could tell. But, but that's, that's the stuff, right? Like you

620
00:38:31,285 --> 00:38:34,885
Speaker 2:  talk about spatial computing, like that is, that is the stuff and there need

621
00:38:35,025 --> 00:38:38,565
Speaker 2:  to be a million more things like that. But that is if if this stuff is ever

622
00:38:38,565 --> 00:38:42,525
Speaker 2:  going to be the thing, it's things like that. But David's like when

623
00:38:42,525 --> 00:38:45,845
Speaker 2:  you were talking about like not ever wanting to wear the Vision Pro around

624
00:38:45,845 --> 00:38:49,765
Speaker 2:  people. Like I had to walk out to my garage, which is a separate building

625
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:53,925
Speaker 2:  holding the Vision Pro and I was like holding it on the side of my body

626
00:38:54,025 --> 00:38:56,005
Speaker 2:  so that like my neighbors wouldn't see me.

627
00:38:57,765 --> 00:39:00,405
Speaker 2:  I have to go to Home Depot this afternoon and I'm gonna bring the Vision

628
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:04,005
Speaker 2:  Pro and just wander the aisles holding stuff up to the Vision Pro just to

629
00:39:04,005 --> 00:39:06,725
Speaker 2:  see what happens. See how quickly they can get kicked outta the store. It's

630
00:39:06,725 --> 00:39:10,245
Speaker 2:  gonna be great. But, okay. Other than calipers, so there are two great uses

631
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:14,045
Speaker 2:  for the Vision Pro. There's calipers, big screens and hand calipers.

632
00:39:14,425 --> 00:39:16,645
Speaker 2:  The big screen thing is really interesting to me 'cause I think that's where

633
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:20,565
Speaker 2:  most people have landed, right? Whether you use it as a, as a big giant display

634
00:39:20,565 --> 00:39:24,485
Speaker 2:  for your Mac or as kind of a, a personal television, it's a

635
00:39:24,485 --> 00:39:27,485
Speaker 2:  big screen. What, what goes on it? Who knows? It's a big screen but then

636
00:39:27,675 --> 00:39:31,565
Speaker 2:  there's all these rumors about like, okay the thing Apple is doing and

637
00:39:31,565 --> 00:39:34,845
Speaker 2:  Mark Kerman at Bloomberg has been reporting this over and over is trying

638
00:39:34,845 --> 00:39:38,605
Speaker 2:  to figure out how to make these things cheaper. And the way that Apple seems

639
00:39:38,605 --> 00:39:42,365
Speaker 2:  to be making it cheaper is by making the screens worse. That

640
00:39:42,395 --> 00:39:45,965
Speaker 2:  that apparently the pixel density of the next vision device

641
00:39:46,255 --> 00:39:50,005
Speaker 2:  might be half of what the current one is. And on the one hand

642
00:39:50,005 --> 00:39:53,085
Speaker 2:  that makes absolute perfect sense. These screens are ridiculous. This is

643
00:39:53,085 --> 00:39:56,365
Speaker 2:  how you get it to be this good. It's also why it's this expensive. Like it's

644
00:39:56,365 --> 00:40:00,325
Speaker 2:  why it takes so much power on and on and on. Does that work, like if you

645
00:40:00,325 --> 00:40:03,805
Speaker 2:  take away the fact that this is such a good screen on your face, does the

646
00:40:03,805 --> 00:40:07,085
Speaker 2:  cheaper version of this become more compelling or does it become less compelling

647
00:40:07,085 --> 00:40:10,925
Speaker 2:  because you've just made the only really great feature half as good?

648
00:40:11,205 --> 00:40:14,325
Speaker 2:  I don't know, I'm so torn. What do you guys think? I think it depends, right?

649
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:17,925
Speaker 2:  I'm torn If it's lighter, if it's more comfortable,

650
00:40:18,785 --> 00:40:22,285
Speaker 2:  if the interaction still works as well.

651
00:40:22,945 --> 00:40:26,485
Speaker 2:  You know that thing where, you know, if you go back and you watch

652
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:30,965
Speaker 2:  like a, you know A DVD even on the right screen, like maybe

653
00:40:31,045 --> 00:40:34,925
Speaker 2:  a 10 80 P TV or whatever, you kind of forget that it's

654
00:40:34,925 --> 00:40:38,805
Speaker 2:  lower resolution for the most part until like some text shows up and You

655
00:40:38,805 --> 00:40:42,725
Speaker 2:  can see all the like aliasing around it or whatever. I wonder if

656
00:40:42,725 --> 00:40:46,565
Speaker 2:  that could be the case with the Vision Pro two, not

657
00:40:46,565 --> 00:40:50,165
Speaker 2:  the Vision Pro two, but the Vision Pro Cheap whatever, whatever they call

658
00:40:50,165 --> 00:40:50,565
Speaker 2:  it. Oh

659
00:40:50,795 --> 00:40:52,845
Speaker 4:  Like Light se Vision

660
00:40:52,905 --> 00:40:54,445
Speaker 2:  Pro isn se Yeah, you Vision Pro, isn se they

661
00:40:54,445 --> 00:40:58,085
Speaker 4:  Should, I just kind of wonder, doesn't that just make it a Metas three?

662
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:59,885
Speaker 4:  Right. And if that's the case, yeah,

663
00:40:59,885 --> 00:41:03,605
Speaker 2:  So they'd have to be really good at

664
00:41:03,785 --> 00:41:04,645
Speaker 2:  all. The other stuff.

665
00:41:05,205 --> 00:41:09,005
Speaker 4:  I was using them kind of concurrently for a while and I would go

666
00:41:09,035 --> 00:41:12,765
Speaker 4:  into the, to the, you know, the Meta Quest three and I'd be like, oh my God,

667
00:41:12,765 --> 00:41:15,525
Speaker 4:  it's so much lighter, it's so much easier to use. There's so many more things

668
00:41:15,525 --> 00:41:18,045
Speaker 4:  to do. And then I'd be in the app and I'm like, dang, this is pixelated.

669
00:41:19,145 --> 00:41:23,045
Speaker 4:  You know, so that would kind of just be like a, you know,

670
00:41:23,045 --> 00:41:26,765
Speaker 4:  I can get around it. It's not the end of the world, but it is a thing that

671
00:41:26,795 --> 00:41:30,445
Speaker 4:  it's just like, okay then what does, what is setting it apart?

672
00:41:30,835 --> 00:41:34,605
Speaker 4:  Because like right now what's setting it apart is the screen, the pass through

673
00:41:34,665 --> 00:41:38,525
Speaker 4:  is just like, oh wow, this is a noticeable noticeably better. And those

674
00:41:38,525 --> 00:41:42,365
Speaker 4:  experiences, like I, I don't know, I don't know. It would have to set

675
00:41:42,365 --> 00:41:44,845
Speaker 4:  itself apart besides being chief.

676
00:41:45,195 --> 00:41:48,525
Speaker 2:  Part of the problem I think is like, I think, I think it was the Germond

677
00:41:48,545 --> 00:41:52,325
Speaker 2:  report from this weekend. I wanna say that

678
00:41:52,905 --> 00:41:56,685
Speaker 2:  he, he said that it might actually be an even like

679
00:41:56,795 --> 00:42:00,485
Speaker 2:  less field of view. It might not have been goman, but like if, if that's

680
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:04,285
Speaker 2:  the case, if it's lower resolution and it's like s you know,

681
00:42:04,885 --> 00:42:07,925
Speaker 2:  suddenly you, you don't have that impressive thing to look at. Then

682
00:42:08,565 --> 00:42:12,405
Speaker 2:  abruptly, the $500 me Quest

683
00:42:12,535 --> 00:42:15,805
Speaker 2:  three versus the maybe

684
00:42:16,025 --> 00:42:19,845
Speaker 2:  $2,000 Vision Pro, like the calculus is suddenly

685
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:23,925
Speaker 2:  like really wonky. 'cause like the experience inside

686
00:42:23,925 --> 00:42:27,285
Speaker 2:  the Vision Pro would have to be significantly better than a MedQuest

687
00:42:27,855 --> 00:42:29,405
Speaker 2:  three or four or whatever.

688
00:42:29,715 --> 00:42:33,485
Speaker 4:  Yeah. I don't know that compromising on the screen is the right move

689
00:42:33,545 --> 00:42:37,445
Speaker 4:  so much as making the materials lighter. Yeah. And cheaper because like

690
00:42:37,445 --> 00:42:40,205
Speaker 4:  isn't it made out of some, like, I forget what exactly it's made of, but

691
00:42:40,205 --> 00:42:42,845
Speaker 4:  you have actual glass on the, on the front of the, I

692
00:42:42,845 --> 00:42:44,645
Speaker 2:  Mean it's metal and glass. Yeah,

693
00:42:44,825 --> 00:42:46,365
Speaker 4:  That's, that is, that's heavy.

694
00:42:46,635 --> 00:42:50,285
Speaker 2:  Well and the Quest three is not that much lighter right. Than the Vision

695
00:42:50,385 --> 00:42:51,245
Speaker 2:  Pro. Like really

696
00:42:51,515 --> 00:42:55,085
Speaker 4:  It's li it's significantly lighter. It's so much easier for me to wear

697
00:42:55,505 --> 00:42:59,445
Speaker 4:  and it's because the weight distribution, it's not so front heavy. The Vision

698
00:42:59,505 --> 00:43:03,325
Speaker 4:  Pro is very front heavy and it's all that glass and I

699
00:43:03,355 --> 00:43:07,205
Speaker 4:  kind of think that is sort of it, it has a very premium

700
00:43:07,475 --> 00:43:10,925
Speaker 4:  feel when you touch it because Apple, right, everything, apple makes premium

701
00:43:11,115 --> 00:43:14,765
Speaker 4:  feel super lux or whatever. You could just make it less lux

702
00:43:15,345 --> 00:43:18,845
Speaker 4:  and keep the thing that makes it really special. Which I think is the screen.

703
00:43:19,065 --> 00:43:22,405
Speaker 4:  Or try to keep that as, as close to possible. I don't know if that's possible,

704
00:43:22,945 --> 00:43:26,045
Speaker 4:  but if I were gonna make this thing cheaper, which you should make it cheaper

705
00:43:26,045 --> 00:43:29,885
Speaker 4:  because it's more fun when more people you know are in there. I, I don't

706
00:43:29,885 --> 00:43:32,965
Speaker 4:  know if that's the right move. I think the right move would be make it lighter

707
00:43:33,585 --> 00:43:35,525
Speaker 4:  and feel cheaper.

708
00:43:36,075 --> 00:43:39,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I mean take the glass off like it can still feel good

709
00:43:39,805 --> 00:43:41,365
Speaker 2:  without having a big, just get

710
00:43:41,365 --> 00:43:43,525
Speaker 4:  Rid of eyesight. Nobody needs that really. I

711
00:43:43,645 --> 00:43:46,525
Speaker 2:  Actually agree with that. Yeah. Put googly eyes on the front of it.

712
00:43:47,035 --> 00:43:50,565
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Honestly I think people would have more fun if you just put giant googly

713
00:43:50,565 --> 00:43:54,285
Speaker 4:  eyes. You know what we, we really will make it like everything everywhere

714
00:43:54,345 --> 00:43:57,205
Speaker 4:  all at once. Just put giant googly eyes on the front. Absolutely. I can pretend

715
00:43:57,305 --> 00:43:57,805
Speaker 4:  I'm a rock

716
00:43:57,875 --> 00:44:01,845
Speaker 2:  Perfectly in keeping with Apple's entire design ethos and branding

717
00:44:01,845 --> 00:44:05,325
Speaker 2:  too. It makes sense. I really like, I never thought I would sit on this podcast

718
00:44:05,505 --> 00:44:08,805
Speaker 2:  and try to convince Apple to make a plastic gadget, but like here we are.

719
00:44:09,515 --> 00:44:12,725
Speaker 2:  It's it, it would probably be better if it were a plastic gadget.

720
00:44:13,065 --> 00:44:16,965
Speaker 4:  It probably would be just because the wearability, I like I I'm

721
00:44:16,965 --> 00:44:20,805
Speaker 4:  gonna say this until I'm blue in the face with a wearable device, it

722
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:24,565
Speaker 4:  has to be wearable. If you're not going to wear it, it's

723
00:44:24,905 --> 00:44:28,805
Speaker 4:  not successful. So if making it plastic means

724
00:44:28,805 --> 00:44:31,805
Speaker 4:  that more people will wear it, not only because it's more comfortable but

725
00:44:31,805 --> 00:44:35,205
Speaker 4:  because it's cheaper. Make it plastic. Just do it or

726
00:44:36,005 --> 00:44:37,525
Speaker 2:  Titanium. Hmm.

727
00:44:38,785 --> 00:44:42,045
Speaker 4:  Is that gonna lower the price Wes? Because we also have to lower the price.

728
00:44:42,145 --> 00:44:45,045
Speaker 2:  No, it's okay. Wes is paying for this thing every month. Just make it $5,000.

729
00:44:45,225 --> 00:44:47,645
Speaker 2:  Wes won't even notice. It'll be fine. Oh God.

730
00:44:49,035 --> 00:44:52,525
Speaker 2:  Well that is a good note to end on. We're gonna get via cheaper one. We're

731
00:44:52,525 --> 00:44:55,285
Speaker 2:  gonna get we and more expensive one and everybody's gonna be happy. It all

732
00:44:55,285 --> 00:44:59,085
Speaker 2:  works out. $10,000. Love it. Let's take it to the moon. Thank you both.

733
00:44:59,265 --> 00:44:59,685
Speaker 2:  Thanks.

734
00:45:00,075 --> 00:45:01,405
Speaker 4:  Alright, thanks for having us.

735
00:45:01,915 --> 00:45:04,925
Speaker 2:  Alright, we gotta take a break and then we're gonna come back and get a bit

736
00:45:04,925 --> 00:45:08,805
Speaker 2:  of a different perspective on what it's like to make

737
00:45:08,805 --> 00:45:11,925
Speaker 2:  stuff for and live inside Vision Pro. We'll be right back.

738
00:45:16,955 --> 00:45:20,525
Speaker 3:  Have a question or need how to advice. Just ask meta

739
00:45:20,785 --> 00:45:24,485
Speaker 3:  AI whether you want to design a marathon training program that will get you

740
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:28,405
Speaker 3:  race ready for the fall. Or you're curious what planets are visible in

741
00:45:28,405 --> 00:45:31,165
Speaker 3:  tonight's sky. Meta AI has the answers.

742
00:45:32,035 --> 00:45:35,725
Speaker 3:  Perhaps you want to learn how to plant basil when your garden only gets

743
00:45:35,725 --> 00:45:39,485
Speaker 3:  indirect sunlight. Meta AI is your intelligent assistant.

744
00:45:40,145 --> 00:45:43,445
Speaker 3:  It can even answer your follow-up questions like what You can make with your

745
00:45:43,535 --> 00:45:47,525
Speaker 3:  basil and other ingredients you have in your fridge. Meta AI

746
00:45:47,545 --> 00:45:51,485
Speaker 3:  can also summarize your class notes, visualize your ideas and so

747
00:45:51,485 --> 00:45:55,445
Speaker 3:  much more. The best part is You can find meta AI right in the apps

748
00:45:55,465 --> 00:45:59,125
Speaker 3:  you already have Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook,

749
00:45:59,345 --> 00:46:00,045
Speaker 3:  and Messenger.

750
00:47:14,405 --> 00:47:18,365
Speaker 2:  the 1950s. It can be this tall teal thing right out of

751
00:47:18,365 --> 00:47:22,325
Speaker 2:  the Jetsons. It can be one of those big flat screen TVs with those huge

752
00:47:22,325 --> 00:47:25,965
Speaker 2:  speakers on the sides. Lots of things. Whatever set you pick, you then

753
00:47:26,155 --> 00:47:29,805
Speaker 2:  plop the set down in your physical space and then then You can put

754
00:47:30,205 --> 00:47:34,085
Speaker 2:  whatever kind of video you want on it. You can stream stuff that you've

755
00:47:34,085 --> 00:47:37,765
Speaker 2:  shot. You can play stuff from YouTube, all kinds of stuff. It's just a

756
00:47:37,765 --> 00:47:41,725
Speaker 2:  television. I like the app because it's charming, but also because it's the

757
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:45,645
Speaker 2:  kind of thing that could only work on a device like the Vision Pro. It

758
00:47:45,645 --> 00:47:49,485
Speaker 2:  would seem like ridiculous kind of kitschy skew, morphic design

759
00:47:49,705 --> 00:47:53,605
Speaker 2:  on an iPad or a TV screen. We've actually seen things like this on those

760
00:47:53,605 --> 00:47:56,765
Speaker 2:  devices and it always seems like kitschy and dysmorphic, but when it's a

761
00:47:56,965 --> 00:48:00,845
Speaker 2:  physical seeming object that You can actually walk around and place in space,

762
00:48:01,355 --> 00:48:05,005
Speaker 2:  it's just more fun. And since the TV stays right where you left it,

763
00:48:05,445 --> 00:48:08,725
Speaker 2:  I kind of use it like a background tv like you might find in a waiting

764
00:48:16,365 --> 00:48:20,325
Speaker 2:  by a company called Sandwich, which you might know from the super deadpan

765
00:48:20,325 --> 00:48:22,965
Speaker 2:  and fun commercials it's been making for a long time.

766
00:48:32,765 --> 00:48:36,165
Speaker 2:  I talked to three of the folks at Sandwich, all of whom worked on the app.

767
00:48:36,585 --> 00:48:40,405
Speaker 7:  I'm Adam Lis Gore. I'm the founder of Sandwich in the context of Sandwich

768
00:48:40,425 --> 00:48:43,885
Speaker 7:  Vision, the Vision OS App Studio. I would say I'm the creative director.

769
00:48:44,265 --> 00:48:44,485
Speaker 2:  My

770
00:48:44,485 --> 00:48:47,645
Speaker 8:  Name's Dan Stear. I am the visual effects supervisor at Sandwich.

771
00:48:48,265 --> 00:48:52,205
Speaker 9:  I'm Andy Roth and I'm the engineer on both television and theater.

772
00:48:52,745 --> 00:48:56,365
Speaker 2:  Oh, right. To Andy's point, they also just made an app called theater, which

773
00:48:56,365 --> 00:48:59,845
Speaker 2:  is similar to television except instead of putting a funky old TV in your

774
00:48:59,845 --> 00:49:03,685
Speaker 2:  living room, it sends you to a big immersive movie theater style place.

775
00:49:04,065 --> 00:49:07,925
Speaker 2:  Anyway, I asked the Sanders team to go back to the beginning a bit, to even

776
00:49:08,065 --> 00:49:11,685
Speaker 2:  before the app existed, even before the Vision Pro was really a thing people

777
00:49:11,685 --> 00:49:15,565
Speaker 2:  could buy and tell me about what it takes to dream up, build,

778
00:49:15,965 --> 00:49:19,845
Speaker 2:  ship, and sell a Vision Pro app. Adam said the idea came to him

779
00:49:20,035 --> 00:49:21,165
Speaker 2:  kind of out of nowhere.

780
00:49:21,655 --> 00:49:25,565
Speaker 7:  Personally speaking, six months ago I did not assume I

781
00:49:25,565 --> 00:49:29,405
Speaker 7:  was gonna be building for the platform. I was just not in software development

782
00:49:29,405 --> 00:49:33,205
Speaker 7:  Headspace at all. I didn't become activated until I was sitting

783
00:49:33,205 --> 00:49:37,165
Speaker 7:  down. I'm working on another startup sort of more in the SaaS space and

784
00:49:37,305 --> 00:49:41,285
Speaker 7:  my co-founder had not really had experience with VR that much and I have

785
00:49:41,285 --> 00:49:45,245
Speaker 7:  a MedQuest at home. I've been a, I was a DK one user, an Oculus DK one

786
00:49:45,245 --> 00:49:48,845
Speaker 7:  user early on, so I've been paying attention and tracking the space but never

787
00:49:48,845 --> 00:49:52,565
Speaker 7:  thought it was worth developing for. The Vision Pro had been announced, my

788
00:49:52,565 --> 00:49:56,125
Speaker 7:  co-founders WA was curious and he said, you have a MedQuest, let see how

789
00:49:56,125 --> 00:50:00,005
Speaker 7:  it's changed since the one time I used it. So we spent kind of

790
00:50:00,005 --> 00:50:03,885
Speaker 7:  half a day just exploring different things in the MedQuest platform

791
00:50:04,305 --> 00:50:07,245
Speaker 7:  and it was fun to see him get activated again. And then we started talking

792
00:50:07,245 --> 00:50:10,445
Speaker 7:  about Vision Pro that was coming and just wondering what are things, what

793
00:50:10,445 --> 00:50:13,685
Speaker 7:  things are gonna happen in this space? And then that night I kind of was

794
00:50:13,685 --> 00:50:17,365
Speaker 7:  laying in bed and I just kind of like my imagination started

795
00:50:17,365 --> 00:50:21,205
Speaker 7:  popping off and I started writing down app ideas in terms of just thinking

796
00:50:21,755 --> 00:50:25,565
Speaker 7:  what does this device make possible that the other devices don't make possible?

797
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:29,645
Speaker 7:  How can we take advantage of our space? Like what? At that point spatial

798
00:50:29,645 --> 00:50:33,605
Speaker 7:  computing as the nomenclature was kind of a laugh, right? It felt like

799
00:50:33,645 --> 00:50:37,445
Speaker 7:  a branded Apple thing that they were making up just to differentiate and

800
00:50:37,445 --> 00:50:41,085
Speaker 7:  not say VR 'cause they're contrarians, which I, and I love that about them

801
00:50:41,185 --> 00:50:44,925
Speaker 7:  of course. So what is spatial computing? What does that

802
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:48,725
Speaker 7:  mean? It means using the space of the world

803
00:50:48,725 --> 00:50:52,565
Speaker 7:  around you as your display, as your you, your interaction

804
00:50:52,575 --> 00:50:56,485
Speaker 7:  model with the software and then suddenly starting to think about,

805
00:50:56,635 --> 00:51:00,445
Speaker 7:  okay, what can happen when computer stuff happens in your space

806
00:51:00,445 --> 00:51:04,125
Speaker 7:  that can't happen when it's on the black rectangle. That's where

807
00:51:04,285 --> 00:51:08,085
Speaker 7:  my imagination started really going into overdrive because

808
00:51:08,135 --> 00:51:12,045
Speaker 7:  we're filmmakers at Sandwich and we think in terms of that 2D

809
00:51:12,045 --> 00:51:15,685
Speaker 7:  rectangle and then obviously in non spatial

810
00:51:15,685 --> 00:51:18,925
Speaker 7:  computing we think in terms of the 2D rectangle, even the people who have,

811
00:51:19,065 --> 00:51:22,725
Speaker 7:  you know, their whole desk is filled with displays that in vertical and

812
00:51:22,725 --> 00:51:26,165
Speaker 7:  horizontal orientations. So like what does it

813
00:51:26,435 --> 00:51:30,285
Speaker 7:  mean when you see past the black rectangle and the world is your display?

814
00:51:30,665 --> 00:51:34,245
Speaker 7:  And then that's when we started, I started dreaming up the television app

815
00:51:34,245 --> 00:51:37,725
Speaker 7:  and that's when I got in touch with Andy and you know, sort of just lucked

816
00:51:37,725 --> 00:51:40,485
Speaker 7:  into meeting Andy and explained the idea to him.

817
00:51:41,075 --> 00:51:44,605
Speaker 2:  Andy, do you remember what the explanation was? I'm trying to imagine how

818
00:51:44,675 --> 00:51:47,485
Speaker 2:  like the four sentence pitch of what television is.

819
00:51:48,435 --> 00:51:52,205
Speaker 9:  Yeah, I think it was basically, let's throw some old school

820
00:51:52,295 --> 00:51:56,205
Speaker 9:  3D TVs in your space and You can watch anything. And I was like, all right,

821
00:51:56,205 --> 00:51:57,205
Speaker 9:  I'm sold pretty good.

822
00:51:57,645 --> 00:52:01,405
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Were you into all the headset vr,

823
00:52:01,745 --> 00:52:02,565
Speaker 2:  ar stuff at the time?

824
00:52:03,155 --> 00:52:07,045
Speaker 9:  Yeah, I've been into VR for a few years. I had been doing development for

825
00:52:07,345 --> 00:52:11,205
Speaker 9:  the Quest for a while in both Unity and Unreal and I've just been

826
00:52:11,205 --> 00:52:15,085
Speaker 9:  anticipating Apple's headset for a few years now, just waiting to

827
00:52:15,085 --> 00:52:19,045
Speaker 9:  see what they could bring to the table and do differently than

828
00:52:19,045 --> 00:52:19,805
Speaker 9:  the other headsets.

829
00:52:20,355 --> 00:52:24,085
Speaker 2:  Like even before it launched. And before you started building, like had you

830
00:52:24,085 --> 00:52:28,045
Speaker 2:  seen what the Vision Pro was? Were you like convinced this was the one like

831
00:52:28,045 --> 00:52:29,245
Speaker 2:  this They're they've done the thing.

832
00:52:30,545 --> 00:52:32,285
Speaker 9:  I'm still not convinced it's the one. Okay.

833
00:52:32,385 --> 00:52:33,565
Speaker 2:  But fair enough. I'm with you on that.

834
00:52:35,025 --> 00:52:39,005
Speaker 9:  But it's, it's definitely an interesting approach to

835
00:52:39,005 --> 00:52:42,085
Speaker 9:  spatial computing and it's something that I've just been interested in since,

836
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:43,365
Speaker 9:  since they announced it.

837
00:52:43,705 --> 00:52:45,285
Speaker 2:  And then Dan, where did you come into the picture?

838
00:52:45,925 --> 00:52:49,565
Speaker 8:  I think in, in those early conversations with Adam, the, the filmmaker

839
00:52:49,565 --> 00:52:52,925
Speaker 8:  storytelling side of the device, like, it, it, it's kind of our

840
00:52:52,925 --> 00:52:56,845
Speaker 8:  responsibility to understand the technology that we're

841
00:52:56,845 --> 00:52:59,725
Speaker 8:  telling stories about and to a certain point getting ahead of it because

842
00:52:59,725 --> 00:53:02,605
Speaker 8:  we're kind of assuming that there's gonna be more vision os developers who

843
00:53:02,605 --> 00:53:06,485
Speaker 8:  are gonna come to us to help tell that spatial computing story. And we don't

844
00:53:06,485 --> 00:53:09,565
Speaker 8:  wanna be guessing at what that's like. We, we wanna know what it's like intimately

845
00:53:09,565 --> 00:53:12,405
Speaker 8:  to, to use the device and what, what are the, what are the amazing parts

846
00:53:12,405 --> 00:53:15,205
Speaker 8:  of it? What does it feel like to use, what's the stuff that's going to really

847
00:53:15,205 --> 00:53:19,045
Speaker 8:  attract people to a product? And that really

848
00:53:19,045 --> 00:53:22,445
Speaker 8:  starts with us using it. You know, we saw all the, the videos that Apple

849
00:53:22,725 --> 00:53:26,085
Speaker 8:  released and that's great and it shows what it can do, but there's no way

850
00:53:26,085 --> 00:53:29,605
Speaker 8:  to prepare you for what it feels like when you first put it on. I mean

851
00:53:29,955 --> 00:53:33,845
Speaker 8:  even in our very early tests with 3D models that didn't have video on

852
00:53:33,845 --> 00:53:36,805
Speaker 8:  them, 'cause I'm not a VR guy, I've never really been a VR guy, but when

853
00:53:36,805 --> 00:53:40,445
Speaker 8:  I put this thing on and I started manipulating a 3D TV in my space,

854
00:53:40,635 --> 00:53:44,365
Speaker 8:  like it was incredible. Like I, I've never felt anything like that before.

855
00:53:44,515 --> 00:53:48,085
Speaker 8:  It's just like I stood up and I walked in a circle around A 3D TV in my office

856
00:53:48,105 --> 00:53:51,765
Speaker 8:  and it's like what is this? Like this is incredible. So you know, getting

857
00:53:51,765 --> 00:53:55,445
Speaker 8:  our feet on the ground like which is Vision os in general was where we started

858
00:53:55,585 --> 00:53:58,005
Speaker 8:  and then what does that enable? What are the, what are the parts of this

859
00:53:58,005 --> 00:54:00,605
Speaker 8:  that we want it to look like? Like what, what is our ideal version of this

860
00:54:00,665 --> 00:54:03,085
Speaker 8:  app? You know, what are the things that we wish it could do? That sort of

861
00:54:03,085 --> 00:54:05,925
Speaker 8:  stuff. That's where we started. I think Adam you just reminded me. We were

862
00:54:05,925 --> 00:54:09,245
Speaker 8:  texting, I think it was a Saturday about this idea and you had one of the

863
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:12,005
Speaker 8:  models, I think it was the streamline media stand or whatever and you texted

864
00:54:12,025 --> 00:54:15,925
Speaker 8:  it to me and I was sitting in a chair watching my kid play and I put my iPhone

865
00:54:15,925 --> 00:54:19,685
Speaker 8:  up in AR mode and I put the TV over there and I just kind of turned and saw

866
00:54:19,765 --> 00:54:23,445
Speaker 8:  a TV and then turned back to my kid and I was like, yeah that's awesome.

867
00:54:23,925 --> 00:54:26,885
Speaker 8:  I want that. I just wanna have a TV over there to the side of my room and

868
00:54:26,885 --> 00:54:27,685
Speaker 8:  there'll be stuff on it.

869
00:54:28,345 --> 00:54:32,205
Speaker 2:  At this point, again, I should mention the Vision Pro wasn't for sale. All

870
00:54:32,205 --> 00:54:36,045
Speaker 2:  the Sandwich guys had, all anyone had was a simulator that they could

871
00:54:36,065 --> 00:54:40,045
Speaker 2:  use to get a rough idea of how it might work. So the

872
00:54:40,045 --> 00:54:43,645
Speaker 2:  team here started with an off the shelf 3D model of a retro tv

873
00:54:43,995 --> 00:54:47,645
Speaker 2:  just kind of spinning it around and seeing how it picked up light and if

874
00:54:47,645 --> 00:54:51,485
Speaker 2:  it felt sort of realistic in this virtual space inside a simulator

875
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:55,605
Speaker 2:  on a computer screen. That worked pretty well Adam said. So then

876
00:54:55,605 --> 00:54:59,485
Speaker 2:  they were off to the races, they found more TV types, sent them to

877
00:54:59,545 --> 00:55:03,405
Speaker 2:  Dan to turn into 3D models and basically tried to figure out how

878
00:55:03,405 --> 00:55:07,205
Speaker 2:  you're actually supposed to interact with all of this stuff. This thing is

879
00:55:07,205 --> 00:55:10,845
Speaker 2:  so new, this whole category of devices is so new that

880
00:55:10,845 --> 00:55:14,685
Speaker 2:  nothing about how we use them is settled. How do you select stuff,

881
00:55:14,775 --> 00:55:18,605
Speaker 2:  where do buttons go? Which should those buttons look like? Nobody knows,

882
00:55:18,775 --> 00:55:21,085
Speaker 2:  which is fun and kind of daunting.

883
00:55:21,585 --> 00:55:25,285
Speaker 7:  We made the classic dev mistake of like making one

884
00:55:25,285 --> 00:55:29,205
Speaker 7:  control panel that had like 18 different buttons on it. Oh

885
00:55:29,205 --> 00:55:32,965
Speaker 7:  sure. That feels like a cockpit of a, of a Cessna And then

886
00:55:33,245 --> 00:55:36,645
Speaker 7:  figuring out okay, what are the use things the user always needs access to

887
00:55:36,665 --> 00:55:40,565
Speaker 7:  and what are the things we can hide behind settings? And Andy came up with

888
00:55:40,565 --> 00:55:44,205
Speaker 7:  some ingenious stuff like the drawer gallery that that slides out you know,

889
00:55:44,505 --> 00:55:48,245
Speaker 7:  of the control panel stuff that nobody else was doing. This is the evergreen

890
00:55:48,245 --> 00:55:51,325
Speaker 7:  time like right now for developing all the, designing all this new language

891
00:55:51,325 --> 00:55:55,005
Speaker 7:  that nobody else is doing. This is when the next put pull to refresh comes

892
00:55:55,005 --> 00:55:58,765
Speaker 7:  out. You know that now like a year from now everybody's using has a pattern.

893
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:03,245
Speaker 2:  Their first real experience with television in a headset came at one of

894
00:56:03,245 --> 00:56:06,965
Speaker 2:  Apple's developer labs in Cupertino. Apple did a lot of these before the

895
00:56:06,965 --> 00:56:10,925
Speaker 2:  Vision Pro came out just to give developers a way to see what their app

896
00:56:10,925 --> 00:56:14,725
Speaker 2:  would look like and how it would feel when real users put on real headsets

897
00:56:14,785 --> 00:56:18,525
Speaker 2:  and had real experiences with their apps. It's a big moment

898
00:56:19,045 --> 00:56:21,565
Speaker 2:  honestly for a lot of these developers. It's a thing I've heard a bunch of

899
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:25,525
Speaker 2:  is you either put it on and it either feels magical and great

900
00:56:25,785 --> 00:56:29,685
Speaker 2:  or it feels totally broken. For the television crew

901
00:56:30,065 --> 00:56:31,005
Speaker 2:  it was pretty good.

902
00:56:31,605 --> 00:56:34,725
Speaker 7:  I looked over at Andy 'cause he got the app up and running before I did.

903
00:56:34,965 --> 00:56:38,165
Speaker 7:  I look over at him, he is got a big smile and he goes, it works, you

904
00:56:38,165 --> 00:56:38,325
Speaker 9:  Know?

905
00:56:39,105 --> 00:56:42,725
Speaker 7:  And then as soon as I got the app up and running it was like, oh this TV

906
00:56:42,835 --> 00:56:46,325
Speaker 7:  that we only have seen flat on the simulator,

907
00:56:46,785 --> 00:56:50,685
Speaker 7:  it now feels like a substantial 3D object in front of me and

908
00:56:50,685 --> 00:56:53,485
Speaker 7:  I can look around it and view it from different angles. It picks up the light

909
00:56:53,915 --> 00:56:56,085
Speaker 7:  that was boom. That was like everything.

910
00:56:56,705 --> 00:57:00,325
Speaker 2:  How true was the simulator in retrospect? Like was it when you loaded up

911
00:57:00,325 --> 00:57:03,605
Speaker 2:  for the first time in the headset, is it, was it what you expected and hoped

912
00:57:03,605 --> 00:57:07,005
Speaker 2:  it would feel like? Or did you all of a sudden understand it in a new way?

913
00:57:07,435 --> 00:57:11,005
Speaker 7:  There's just no substitute for your actual space. You know, you could take

914
00:57:11,005 --> 00:57:14,445
Speaker 7:  a photo of your actual space and put it at, you know, use it as your environment.

915
00:57:14,865 --> 00:57:18,005
Speaker 7:  You can model your own room and put it into the simulator and it doesn't

916
00:57:18,005 --> 00:57:21,885
Speaker 7:  even come close to 1% of the experience of of what VR

917
00:57:21,985 --> 00:57:25,925
Speaker 7:  is supposed to be or ar. That's the most frustrating thing as storytellers

918
00:57:25,985 --> 00:57:29,765
Speaker 7:  or 'cause if you, I mean if we're designing products we know that the

919
00:57:30,145 --> 00:57:33,685
Speaker 7:  end user is going to experience the same product as we're experiencing in

920
00:57:33,685 --> 00:57:37,405
Speaker 7:  their own space. If you're telling the story in 2D like we had to do,

921
00:57:37,675 --> 00:57:41,205
Speaker 7:  like we often have to do a software like Dan alluded to. It's so

922
00:57:41,445 --> 00:57:45,325
Speaker 7:  frustrating 'cause you can't even come close to the feeling of it until these

923
00:57:45,325 --> 00:57:48,765
Speaker 7:  technologies are pervasive where everybody's using it. So you know, there's

924
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:52,645
Speaker 7:  no disparity between the superficial simulation of it and the real thing.

925
00:57:53,075 --> 00:57:56,645
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Andy you were smiling as he was saying that. What was that experience

926
00:57:56,645 --> 00:57:57,005
Speaker 2:  like for you?

927
00:57:57,875 --> 00:58:01,485
Speaker 9:  Yeah, that experience in the dev lab was a little more nerve

928
00:58:01,485 --> 00:58:05,085
Speaker 9:  wracking for me I think than Adam with other VR

929
00:58:05,245 --> 00:58:09,085
Speaker 9:  headsets. I have some experience where, you know, you build something on

930
00:58:09,125 --> 00:58:12,805
Speaker 9:  a PC and it is running great on this Nvidia graphics

931
00:58:12,955 --> 00:58:16,925
Speaker 9:  card and then you go to build it on the quest and everything just falls apart,

932
00:58:17,325 --> 00:58:21,285
Speaker 9:  right? And so I was, I was really, really nervous about

933
00:58:21,285 --> 00:58:24,885
Speaker 9:  that happening 'cause we'd been using the simulator for a few months but

934
00:58:24,885 --> 00:58:28,765
Speaker 9:  luckily the simulator is pretty representative of how the device works, the

935
00:58:28,925 --> 00:58:31,725
Speaker 9:  software at least you don't get, you know, the full experience of wearing

936
00:58:31,725 --> 00:58:35,365
Speaker 9:  it. And we went to that dev lab and it just worked like I

937
00:58:35,605 --> 00:58:37,605
Speaker 9:  expected. I was just, I was so excited.

938
00:58:37,875 --> 00:58:38,885
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's pretty cool

939
00:58:39,065 --> 00:58:43,005
Speaker 7:  To Apple's credit 'cause they really have built a supercomputer device in

940
00:58:43,005 --> 00:58:46,805
Speaker 7:  that thing. It's this, it's not hobbled. Even the version 1.0 of it,

941
00:58:47,025 --> 00:58:50,925
Speaker 7:  the processor is not hobbled. It can do what they want you to do with it.

942
00:58:51,665 --> 00:58:55,205
Speaker 2:  Dan what about you like building all this stuff, making it work like you,

943
00:58:55,205 --> 00:58:58,525
Speaker 2:  you're, you're sort of deep in the details of it. What is that experience

944
00:58:58,525 --> 00:59:01,685
Speaker 2:  like the first time you're actually sort of inside of the space getting to

945
00:59:01,685 --> 00:59:02,245
Speaker 2:  look at the space?

946
00:59:02,885 --> 00:59:06,125
Speaker 8:  I mean to Apple's credit, I mean they, they had sort of laid the groundwork

947
00:59:06,425 --> 00:59:10,205
Speaker 8:  for this stuff with AR kit on the phones and fair. Yeah. Playing around with

948
00:59:10,205 --> 00:59:13,925
Speaker 8:  these models on an iPhone, you, you get a decent sense of like what level

949
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:17,485
Speaker 8:  of quality you're gonna get out of it. You know, all of the USDZ format stuff,

950
00:59:17,495 --> 00:59:20,205
Speaker 8:  which is all very boring, but it's great that it worked outta the box basically.

951
00:59:20,205 --> 00:59:23,050
Speaker 8:  So you kind of understood that they're gonna wrap it in this sort of like

952
00:59:23,475 --> 00:59:26,805
Speaker 8:  soft world sphere of lighting so it, it accepts some of the light around

953
00:59:26,805 --> 00:59:30,765
Speaker 8:  you. But in the filmmaking world from visual effects, if a 3D model

954
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:35,125
Speaker 8:  doesn't look good, you just like give it a million more polygons and render

955
00:59:35,125 --> 00:59:38,605
Speaker 8:  it and it's gonna take a day to render a frame but it look, it'll look great

956
00:59:38,665 --> 00:59:42,445
Speaker 8:  and you can't do that kind of stuff in VR or in any of these systems.

957
00:59:42,585 --> 00:59:46,205
Speaker 8:  So finding ways to not destroy all of

958
00:59:46,225 --> 00:59:49,405
Speaker 8:  Andy's work with a model that's, you know, three gigabytes or something is,

959
00:59:49,425 --> 00:59:52,845
Speaker 8:  is very complicated work. It's, it's a, it's a delicate balancing act between

960
00:59:53,505 --> 00:59:57,365
Speaker 8:  detail and performance at all times. I mean there are a few tests we did

961
00:59:57,875 --> 01:00:01,365
Speaker 8:  that just, they were just dead on arrival where it's just like, yeah just

962
01:00:01,365 --> 01:00:03,445
Speaker 8:  throw all the detail in the world at it 'cause it'll look great and it's

963
01:00:03,445 --> 01:00:07,285
Speaker 8:  like, oh my computer is dying. The Vision Pro doesn't like this. Like let's

964
01:00:07,285 --> 01:00:09,645
Speaker 8:  take a step back for a minute and figure out like what we actually need to

965
01:00:09,645 --> 01:00:11,765
Speaker 8:  do to optimize it. Which is very interesting 'cause there's not a lot of

966
01:00:11,765 --> 01:00:14,405
Speaker 8:  people a a, there's not a lot of people trying this sort of stuff within

967
01:00:14,405 --> 01:00:17,285
Speaker 8:  their apps and b there's definitely not a lot of people talking about how

968
01:00:17,285 --> 01:00:20,765
Speaker 8:  to do it. I think only recently we've gotten some guidance from Apple in

969
01:00:20,765 --> 01:00:24,445
Speaker 8:  terms of like how to optimize your app for Vision Os and it's like, oh

970
01:00:24,905 --> 01:00:28,765
Speaker 8:  we missed those targets by a long shot but you know, we're doing our own

971
01:00:28,765 --> 01:00:31,285
Speaker 8:  version of that so, you know, trying to align with what they want us to do

972
01:00:31,285 --> 01:00:33,085
Speaker 8:  is, it's interesting. It's, it's fun work too.

973
01:00:33,435 --> 01:00:36,965
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And this level of detail is even more apparent

974
01:00:37,265 --> 01:00:40,365
Speaker 7:  and frustrating and challenging in our theater app that we're, you know,

975
01:00:40,365 --> 01:00:43,805
Speaker 7:  that we're sort of building out right now because it's not just a 3D object

976
01:00:43,825 --> 01:00:47,605
Speaker 7:  in front of you, it's an immersive space that really does require detail

977
01:00:47,625 --> 01:00:51,445
Speaker 7:  in, in order to render believably at a massive scale. So

978
01:00:51,915 --> 01:00:55,765
Speaker 7:  like it's, it's almost like 10 x the challenge in the room as

979
01:00:55,765 --> 01:00:58,885
Speaker 7:  it is to just have the polygonal object in front of you. Right?

980
01:00:58,985 --> 01:01:01,565
Speaker 8:  And we made it harder by saying like we want people to be able to move around

981
01:01:01,565 --> 01:01:04,965
Speaker 8:  the space to to to like actually experience the theater. If we just sat in

982
01:01:04,965 --> 01:01:08,405
Speaker 8:  one place and everything 20 yards away was, you know, fewer

983
01:01:08,525 --> 01:01:12,365
Speaker 8:  polygons and cheapens detail like that would be great for performance but

984
01:01:12,365 --> 01:01:15,285
Speaker 8:  we don't want that out of our experience so we gotta figure out how to make

985
01:01:15,285 --> 01:01:15,565
Speaker 8:  that work.

986
01:01:16,355 --> 01:01:19,725
Speaker 2:  This is the thing I'm so stuck on when it comes to Vision Pro and the thing

987
01:01:19,725 --> 01:01:23,405
Speaker 2:  that I keep feeling as I use it. There's so much cool tech in here

988
01:01:23,785 --> 01:01:27,365
Speaker 2:  and to a large extent it is remarkable that it works as well as it does forget

989
01:01:27,365 --> 01:01:30,685
Speaker 2:  about the fact that it's $3,500, which I think is ridiculous. Forget about

990
01:01:30,685 --> 01:01:34,485
Speaker 2:  the fact that it's so big. Forget about the battery life, it's impressive

991
01:01:34,485 --> 01:01:38,365
Speaker 2:  that this thing exists at all. But like are we sure this is

992
01:01:38,385 --> 01:01:42,325
Speaker 2:  how it should be? Should I really have to laser focus my eyes on a

993
01:01:42,325 --> 01:01:45,565
Speaker 2:  button for the entire time it takes to click it? Do I want to do some things

994
01:01:45,565 --> 01:01:49,485
Speaker 2:  with my hands and other things with buttons? Is a virtual keyboard

995
01:01:49,805 --> 01:01:53,365
Speaker 2:  floating in the air a good idea? What is the best way to move windows around

996
01:01:53,425 --> 01:01:57,245
Speaker 2:  or send something to someone or open an app or anything else? These

997
01:01:57,245 --> 01:02:01,205
Speaker 2:  things get decided and then we treat them as if they were inevitable. But

998
01:02:01,205 --> 01:02:04,205
Speaker 2:  it just isn't that way and it doesn't have to be that way. And there's something

999
01:02:04,565 --> 01:02:08,245
Speaker 2:  exciting about the fact that on the Vision Pro, all of this feels new and

1000
01:02:08,245 --> 01:02:11,965
Speaker 2:  unknown and also there's something deeply annoying about the fact that

1001
01:02:12,065 --> 01:02:16,005
Speaker 2:  so much of it right now just feels weird to use. But from a

1002
01:02:16,025 --> 01:02:20,005
Speaker 2:  big picture perspective, I really like the way Adam described how he thinks

1003
01:02:20,005 --> 01:02:23,205
Speaker 2:  about the user experience and how the vision pro ought to feel.

1004
01:02:23,935 --> 01:02:27,325
Speaker 7:  We're in an interesting space with its own opportunity 'cause we're trying

1005
01:02:27,325 --> 01:02:30,925
Speaker 7:  to build experiences that feel like the real world but better,

1006
01:02:31,135 --> 01:02:34,605
Speaker 7:  right? So just imagine you go outside and suddenly you want the

1007
01:02:34,605 --> 01:02:38,325
Speaker 7:  information of the world at your fingertips. So what is the interaction that

1008
01:02:38,325 --> 01:02:42,005
Speaker 7:  your mind would design in that moment? Hmm? How do you wanna reach up and

1009
01:02:42,005 --> 01:02:45,085
Speaker 7:  access the information and then have it go away? That's essentially what

1010
01:02:45,085 --> 01:02:48,285
Speaker 7:  we're doing. We're sitting our users down in a movie theater. If you were

1011
01:02:48,285 --> 01:02:51,485
Speaker 7:  in a movie theater that you could just chill out in all the time and be by

1012
01:02:51,725 --> 01:02:55,685
Speaker 7:  yourself and You can summon any content to that big

1013
01:02:55,685 --> 01:02:59,005
Speaker 7:  screen, how would you do that? What would be an interaction model

1014
01:02:59,465 --> 01:03:03,085
Speaker 7:  or you know, a lot of it just translated to the outside space. I think that's

1015
01:03:03,085 --> 01:03:06,845
Speaker 7:  how designer UI designers have to think about this stuff is knowing

1016
01:03:06,845 --> 01:03:10,765
Speaker 7:  that eventually 50 years in the future there will be no hardware and

1017
01:03:10,985 --> 01:03:14,685
Speaker 7:  the world in front of us will always be sort of like have a digital layer

1018
01:03:14,745 --> 01:03:18,645
Speaker 7:  to it that feels organic and real. What is that interaction model?

1019
01:03:18,825 --> 01:03:22,525
Speaker 7:  You know? So if You can summon things, you know, really we are,

1020
01:03:22,535 --> 01:03:26,405
Speaker 7:  especially at this early phase of the O os as a, as a platform,

1021
01:03:26,735 --> 01:03:30,245
Speaker 7:  we're at the mercy of Apple 'cause Apple, you know, they'll let you do new

1022
01:03:30,245 --> 01:03:33,885
Speaker 7:  cool things that they've deemed worthy of the SDK

1023
01:03:34,465 --> 01:03:38,205
Speaker 7:  and then we will be able to do new cool futures. And I think

1024
01:03:38,205 --> 01:03:41,085
Speaker 7:  that at some point there's an inflection point where

1025
01:03:41,535 --> 01:03:45,325
Speaker 7:  developers kind of invent new stuff and then Apple follows. But right now

1026
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:48,405
Speaker 7:  I think we're in the apple leading time of the of the process.

1027
01:03:49,185 --> 01:03:52,925
Speaker 2:  Do you feel like that's the right way for things to be right now? I think

1028
01:03:52,925 --> 01:03:55,965
Speaker 2:  that's probably pretty normal for a new platform like this, but are you,

1029
01:03:56,105 --> 01:03:59,085
Speaker 2:  are you like chafing at the edges of what Apple will let you do or does it

1030
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:00,285
Speaker 2:  feel like we're in the a good zone?

1031
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:04,485
Speaker 7:  Yeah but a perfect example is like playing with light to

1032
01:04:04,485 --> 01:04:08,405
Speaker 7:  reflect what the real world feels like. We know that we want, when you use

1033
01:04:08,405 --> 01:04:12,045
Speaker 7:  a real tv, especially a vintage one with a a bezel,

1034
01:04:12,225 --> 01:04:15,445
Speaker 7:  the light that casts from the screen is reflected on the edges of the tv,

1035
01:04:15,575 --> 01:04:19,525
Speaker 7:  right? Well that is not easy to do with, especially in

1036
01:04:19,705 --> 01:04:23,565
Speaker 7:  os one of reality kit. We know that in apple's own

1037
01:04:23,565 --> 01:04:27,085
Speaker 7:  immersive cinema, when something is playing on that big screen,

1038
01:04:27,705 --> 01:04:31,525
Speaker 7:  the light bounces off the screen to the ceiling and the floor and

1039
01:04:31,625 --> 01:04:35,605
Speaker 7:  in real time it makes it feel very material, it makes

1040
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:38,925
Speaker 7:  it feel like the light is real and the surfaces are real. Hmm. And Apple

1041
01:04:38,925 --> 01:04:42,805
Speaker 7:  doesn't make that easy because working with light as a source

1042
01:04:43,305 --> 01:04:47,245
Speaker 7:  in reality kit version one was really not possible. And

1043
01:04:47,405 --> 01:04:51,005
Speaker 7:  version two Apple's decided let's make these tools available to

1044
01:04:51,005 --> 01:04:54,845
Speaker 7:  developers and that means that we can start to build in this new

1045
01:04:55,355 --> 01:04:59,325
Speaker 7:  replication of reality that wasn't possible before. And in in our app

1046
01:04:59,325 --> 01:05:03,245
Speaker 7:  in theater Andy came up with an ingenious way to fake it of reflections from

1047
01:05:03,245 --> 01:05:07,165
Speaker 7:  the screen bouncing off the walls in the ceiling and floor. But now

1048
01:05:07,165 --> 01:05:08,925
Speaker 7:  we get to do it for real, which is very exciting.

1049
01:05:09,735 --> 01:05:13,705
Speaker 2:  Obviously a lot of this stuff is changing really fast. Apple just announced

1050
01:05:13,705 --> 01:05:17,525
Speaker 2:  Vision OS two which has a bunch of big changes including some of what Adam

1051
01:05:17,585 --> 01:05:20,765
Speaker 2:  is talking about with reflections and light. I mean these are the things,

1052
01:05:20,765 --> 01:05:24,645
Speaker 2:  right? You have to change the way that light works in

1053
01:05:24,645 --> 01:05:28,365
Speaker 2:  an API in order for apps to be able to build things that feel real like this

1054
01:05:28,365 --> 01:05:32,085
Speaker 2:  is how long the pipeline is. Television has been out since February

1055
01:05:32,185 --> 01:05:36,125
Speaker 2:  and it has already changed a lot. You can now browse and watch YouTube inside

1056
01:05:36,125 --> 01:05:39,565
Speaker 2:  of television. You can use share play to watch stuff with friends. There

1057
01:05:39,565 --> 01:05:43,445
Speaker 2:  are a few new ways to fast forward and rewind and control playback speed

1058
01:05:43,625 --> 01:05:47,605
Speaker 2:  and You can now play spatial video on any of the screens too. That's

1059
01:05:47,605 --> 01:05:51,485
Speaker 2:  kind of the Vision Pro thing, right? Ultra retro TV playing the file format

1060
01:05:51,485 --> 01:05:55,405
Speaker 2:  of the future supposedly. Anyway, the last thing I asked the

1061
01:05:55,605 --> 01:05:59,525
Speaker 2:  sandwich crew was how it's going. Being someone who sells Vision

1062
01:05:59,585 --> 01:06:00,045
Speaker 2:  Pro apps.

1063
01:06:00,675 --> 01:06:03,565
Speaker 7:  It's funny 'cause you know in the early days of iPhone I think everybody

1064
01:06:03,755 --> 01:06:07,445
Speaker 7:  assumed app millionaires. You know, you're just, the business model for

1065
01:06:07,865 --> 01:06:11,845
Speaker 7:  app development is you make the app and then you sell a

1066
01:06:11,845 --> 01:06:15,405
Speaker 7:  billion copies of it and you get rich. But I think it's what's more

1067
01:06:15,645 --> 01:06:18,605
Speaker 7:  interesting from a business perspective is what is, what are the models that

1068
01:06:18,605 --> 01:06:22,245
Speaker 7:  it opens up that weren't possible before? And in our case it's like for

1069
01:06:22,245 --> 01:06:26,005
Speaker 7:  delivering content, if our app is a content delivery

1070
01:06:26,025 --> 01:06:29,605
Speaker 7:  system, then where are the business opportunities in that?

1071
01:06:30,035 --> 01:06:33,885
Speaker 7:  It's pretty fascinating stuff. The mind reels with possibilities

1072
01:06:34,105 --> 01:06:37,525
Speaker 7:  but I don't know like what in terms of app sales? Oh it's definitely been

1073
01:06:37,525 --> 01:06:41,405
Speaker 7:  a loss. I mean like this business runs at a cost at

1074
01:06:41,445 --> 01:06:45,165
Speaker 7:  a net loss and I expected that to be the case. I mean I held out hope.

1075
01:06:45,385 --> 01:06:48,725
Speaker 7:  You know, we didn't, none of us knew. We didn't know if like we were gonna

1076
01:06:48,725 --> 01:06:52,365
Speaker 7:  get a hundred thousand downloads on the first day. We did not.

1077
01:06:54,145 --> 01:06:58,125
Speaker 7:  But it turns out like that's not the exciting part of this. The exciting

1078
01:06:58,125 --> 01:07:01,925
Speaker 7:  part is like building a new, it's a whole new infrastructure for creating

1079
01:07:02,245 --> 01:07:05,325
Speaker 7:  software and running a business and that's where it really gets interesting.

1080
01:07:06,205 --> 01:07:09,615
Speaker 2:  Like a lot of developers I've talked to, they're really optimistic about

1081
01:07:09,615 --> 01:07:13,535
Speaker 2:  where all this could go and I sort of hope that they're right. It'd be

1082
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:17,495
Speaker 2:  fun to have the Vision Pro become a huge new platform with lots of new

1083
01:07:17,505 --> 01:07:21,415
Speaker 2:  kinds of things to do. And the more there is to do, the better the headset

1084
01:07:21,555 --> 01:07:24,735
Speaker 2:  is and the better the headset is, the more people will buy it and the more

1085
01:07:24,735 --> 01:07:28,215
Speaker 2:  people who buy it, the more developers will get on board and the more developers

1086
01:07:28,215 --> 01:07:32,095
Speaker 2:  get on board, the more there is to do and then the flywheel is off and

1087
01:07:32,095 --> 01:07:35,175
Speaker 2:  running. This is the thing you need if you want a platform like this to work.

1088
01:07:35,605 --> 01:07:38,975
Speaker 2:  I've got a Vision pro sitting right here next to me. Luckily I didn't buy

1089
01:07:38,975 --> 01:07:42,495
Speaker 2:  it. I think The Verge did and I just stole it for a while. And as impressive

1090
01:07:42,495 --> 01:07:46,455
Speaker 2:  as it is, I just don't use it very much. The only way that is going to change

1091
01:07:46,875 --> 01:07:50,575
Speaker 2:  is if more developers find more of these silly, fun, weird

1092
01:07:50,575 --> 01:07:52,815
Speaker 2:  things to make for it. I really hope they do.

1093
01:07:54,085 --> 01:07:56,975
Speaker 2:  Alright, we gotta take one more break and then we're gonna come back and

1094
01:07:56,975 --> 01:07:59,255
Speaker 2:  take a question from The Vergecast hotline. We'll be right back.

1095
01:09:52,085 --> 01:09:55,805
Speaker 10:  actual computer aspect of that product is already

1096
01:09:55,805 --> 01:09:59,605
Speaker 10:  pretty compact. If you take off the light seal and

1097
01:09:59,665 --> 01:10:03,605
Speaker 10:  the headband and even like the stems where like the speaker

1098
01:10:03,605 --> 01:10:07,525
Speaker 10:  is and just look at the sort of like eye mask ish

1099
01:10:07,915 --> 01:10:11,885
Speaker 10:  part of it, it's pretty slim and most

1100
01:10:11,905 --> 01:10:15,845
Speaker 10:  of the bulk that you get from the headset is actually the distance

1101
01:10:15,845 --> 01:10:19,565
Speaker 10:  needed or like presumably needed to not fry your

1102
01:10:19,565 --> 01:10:23,205
Speaker 10:  eyeballs off of just looking at really small screens in

1103
01:10:23,205 --> 01:10:27,085
Speaker 10:  really bright light. So how do you expect Vision Pro

1104
01:10:27,185 --> 01:10:30,645
Speaker 10:  to progress to something more wearable or more socially

1105
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:34,445
Speaker 10:  acceptable if the size of it is not

1106
01:10:34,885 --> 01:10:38,685
Speaker 10:  actually the tech and is actually just like natural

1107
01:10:39,175 --> 01:10:42,685
Speaker 10:  human physiology of not being able to strap LCDs to

1108
01:10:42,995 --> 01:10:46,805
Speaker 10:  your eyeballs really closely. I'm curious what you guys see the

1109
01:10:46,805 --> 01:10:49,965
Speaker 10:  Vision Pro series two or three or four or five

1110
01:10:50,735 --> 01:10:54,405
Speaker 10:  where the thing should get smaller, but just given the way

1111
01:10:54,405 --> 01:10:58,365
Speaker 10:  they've built this around pass through and LCD displays, I

1112
01:10:58,365 --> 01:11:01,565
Speaker 10:  don't expect it to follow the same path as some of their other products

1113
01:11:01,875 --> 01:11:02,845
Speaker 10:  that you, bye.

1114
01:11:03,585 --> 01:11:07,165
Speaker 2:  So I think this is the question, right? I think if you're Apple,

1115
01:11:07,585 --> 01:11:11,325
Speaker 2:  you have to do one of two things here. You either have to figure out how

1116
01:11:11,325 --> 01:11:15,005
Speaker 2:  to take what the Vision Pro is basically in in its

1117
01:11:15,295 --> 01:11:19,165
Speaker 2:  relatively current hardware form and make it more palatable to people.

1118
01:11:19,305 --> 01:11:22,965
Speaker 2:  And I think what that looks like is just making it cheaper,

1119
01:11:23,055 --> 01:11:26,925
Speaker 2:  right? Like take this exact Vision Pro and make it half the price and I think

1120
01:11:26,925 --> 01:11:30,085
Speaker 2:  it would be more than twice as compelling to more than twice as many people.

1121
01:11:30,345 --> 01:11:34,325
Speaker 2:  That's a hard thing to do. That is the kind of thing that happens over time

1122
01:11:34,395 --> 01:11:38,365
Speaker 2:  just as you get better technology. But it doesn't happen quickly and it

1123
01:11:38,365 --> 01:11:42,005
Speaker 2:  doesn't happen easily. And so a lot of the stuff that we've seen for

1124
01:11:42,115 --> 01:11:46,045
Speaker 2:  Apple's new, cheaper, simpler push that we've heard about has to

1125
01:11:46,045 --> 01:11:49,725
Speaker 2:  do with the screens in particular. These screens are ridiculously expensive,

1126
01:11:49,955 --> 01:11:53,765
Speaker 2:  they're hard to produce, they are as good as you will find in a headset.

1127
01:11:54,265 --> 01:11:57,645
Speaker 2:  And I think what we're gonna see is Apple try to just pull all of that down

1128
01:11:57,925 --> 01:12:01,525
Speaker 2:  a little bit to make it cheaper. And in theory, lower

1129
01:12:01,805 --> 01:12:05,725
Speaker 2:  resolution would mean lower power, it would mean less need for things like

1130
01:12:05,835 --> 01:12:09,805
Speaker 2:  cooling. It would solve some other problems just by not

1131
01:12:09,805 --> 01:12:13,005
Speaker 2:  having to drive so many pixels all the time. And so you might get a little

1132
01:12:13,005 --> 01:12:16,765
Speaker 2:  bit smaller and more wearable there, but I don't think so the question

1133
01:12:16,825 --> 01:12:20,365
Speaker 2:  is right that this thing is already pretty small, like as a pure

1134
01:12:20,695 --> 01:12:24,565
Speaker 2:  piece of hardware, it's pretty remarkable. It's made of metal so you could

1135
01:12:24,625 --> 01:12:27,965
Speaker 2:  get some weight back on that front. It's definitely

1136
01:12:28,335 --> 01:12:31,085
Speaker 2:  rigid in a way that I think over time these things will wanna be a little

1137
01:12:31,085 --> 01:12:34,005
Speaker 2:  more flexible, which will make them wearable. But I don't know how you make

1138
01:12:34,005 --> 01:12:37,405
Speaker 2:  this thing that much smaller and that much lighter without

1139
01:12:37,405 --> 01:12:40,805
Speaker 2:  fundamentally changing what it's, which brings me to the other point. I just

1140
01:12:40,805 --> 01:12:44,205
Speaker 2:  can't stop thinking about the difference between what the Vision Pro is and

1141
01:12:44,205 --> 01:12:47,965
Speaker 2:  is trying to be and what the RayBan meta smart glasses are

1142
01:12:48,065 --> 01:12:52,005
Speaker 2:  and are trying to be. And it's so obvious to me at

1143
01:12:52,005 --> 01:12:55,925
Speaker 2:  this point that the RayBan meta strategy is the right one.

1144
01:12:56,245 --> 01:12:59,405
Speaker 2:  I think especially if you believe that AI is gonna change how we talk to

1145
01:12:59,605 --> 01:13:03,445
Speaker 2:  computers. Having something on your face that is essentially a very good

1146
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:07,245
Speaker 2:  microphone, a good set of speakers and a camera actually gets you

1147
01:13:07,365 --> 01:13:11,205
Speaker 2:  a shocking amount of power out of your device. You can do so

1148
01:13:11,275 --> 01:13:15,165
Speaker 2:  much with a simple wearable thing that can see the world and talk

1149
01:13:15,165 --> 01:13:19,045
Speaker 2:  to you. That is massively powerful, especially if you believe AI is really

1150
01:13:19,065 --> 01:13:22,245
Speaker 2:  the future. What Apple has built here is that

1151
01:13:22,875 --> 01:13:26,605
Speaker 2:  plus a screen and an entertainment device. And I think that's

1152
01:13:27,125 --> 01:13:30,965
Speaker 2:  interesting and that's where we will go in the future. But the road

1153
01:13:31,035 --> 01:13:34,965
Speaker 2:  from here to there I think looks a lot more like smart

1154
01:13:34,965 --> 01:13:38,205
Speaker 2:  glasses than it does like headsets, if that makes sense.

1155
01:13:38,745 --> 01:13:42,725
Speaker 2:  The steps between something like the RayBan Meta Smart Glasses and

1156
01:13:42,725 --> 01:13:46,205
Speaker 2:  something like the Quest, even if you wanna take the other meta product out

1157
01:13:46,205 --> 01:13:49,805
Speaker 2:  there are super unknown too. It's a lot of really hard

1158
01:13:49,805 --> 01:13:53,325
Speaker 2:  problems to solve in displays and in processor

1159
01:13:53,325 --> 01:13:57,125
Speaker 2:  efficiency and in how to get a GPU on your face that is good enough to work

1160
01:13:57,265 --> 01:14:00,925
Speaker 2:  all day, how to solve battery life. Like people talk about

1161
01:14:01,185 --> 01:14:04,645
Speaker 2:  making a lot of huge progress in tech as like solving

1162
01:14:05,205 --> 01:14:09,005
Speaker 2:  multiple physics miracles all at once. And that's kind of what Apple and

1163
01:14:09,005 --> 01:14:12,765
Speaker 2:  meta need if you believe that these all encompassing

1164
01:14:12,765 --> 01:14:16,285
Speaker 2:  headsets are the thing. But if you don't and I'm not sure that I do,

1165
01:14:16,795 --> 01:14:20,285
Speaker 2:  then smart glasses is the answer. And I think

1166
01:14:20,585 --> 01:14:24,565
Speaker 2:  if you're Apple, you had the iPod before the iPhone, you could

1167
01:14:24,565 --> 01:14:28,125
Speaker 2:  look at smart glasses as the iPod, they don't do as much but they do it very

1168
01:14:28,125 --> 01:14:32,085
Speaker 2:  well. They are the right form factor, they feel good people like them, they

1169
01:14:32,085 --> 01:14:35,925
Speaker 2:  solve a couple of very specific problems. And

1170
01:14:35,925 --> 01:14:39,685
Speaker 2:  then years later, once the tech gets better, once people get more

1171
01:14:39,685 --> 01:14:43,525
Speaker 2:  comfortable with the idea of the form factor, once you've found a couple

1172
01:14:43,525 --> 01:14:46,925
Speaker 2:  of new things to do and new ways to interact, then you do

1173
01:14:47,305 --> 01:14:51,165
Speaker 2:  the iPhone. We weren't ready for the iPhone in 2001

1174
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:55,165
Speaker 2:  when they started shipping iPods. The technology wasn't there, the world

1175
01:14:55,225 --> 01:14:58,765
Speaker 2:  wasn't ready. We didn't have the sort of cultural understanding of how all

1176
01:14:58,765 --> 01:15:01,885
Speaker 2:  this stuff would work. It just wouldn't have worked as well as it did six

1177
01:15:01,885 --> 01:15:05,445
Speaker 2:  years later. And I think headsets might be the same thing. And Apple

1178
01:15:05,875 --> 01:15:09,805
Speaker 2:  just tried to skip all the way to like the iPhone 10

1179
01:15:10,475 --> 01:15:14,405
Speaker 2:  instead of shipping the iPod. And I'm totally brutalizing this

1180
01:15:14,645 --> 01:15:18,565
Speaker 2:  metaphor, but I think I have no evidence for this, but I think that if

1181
01:15:18,565 --> 01:15:21,445
Speaker 2:  you're on Apple's hardware team, you're looking at the RayBan Meta Smartt

1182
01:15:21,445 --> 01:15:24,725
Speaker 2:  glasses and saying, oh, what we should have done is built something that

1183
01:15:25,005 --> 01:15:28,805
Speaker 2:  does less stuff and is wearable instead of trying to

1184
01:15:28,805 --> 01:15:32,405
Speaker 2:  build the thing that does all the things, including some things that people

1185
01:15:32,405 --> 01:15:36,285
Speaker 2:  don't really want and isn't all that wearable. So the idea of what

1186
01:15:36,285 --> 01:15:39,885
Speaker 2:  the Vision Pro is now, it's gonna be hard to make this thing more wearable.

1187
01:15:39,885 --> 01:15:43,045
Speaker 2:  There's some things Apple can do with the straps, like just having the overhead

1188
01:15:43,055 --> 01:15:46,485
Speaker 2:  strap built in instead of having just the one around

1189
01:15:46,795 --> 01:15:50,325
Speaker 2:  goes a long way towards making it wearable. Actually Adam Lior from Sando

1190
01:15:50,675 --> 01:15:54,485
Speaker 2:  said in our interview that he has actually taken out the light

1191
01:15:54,485 --> 01:15:58,405
Speaker 2:  seal, he uses the overhead strap and uses it essentially like an AR device

1192
01:15:58,405 --> 01:16:02,245
Speaker 2:  so he can see around it and uses it much less

1193
01:16:02,555 --> 01:16:05,685
Speaker 2:  sort of immersively, but it's still very comfortable for him. And I think

1194
01:16:05,685 --> 01:16:08,725
Speaker 2:  that's really clever and there are more ways that Apple can start to press

1195
01:16:08,725 --> 01:16:11,965
Speaker 2:  on that. Solving some of the battery stuff will go a long way, like just

1196
01:16:11,965 --> 01:16:15,925
Speaker 2:  having that cord on your face is a real wearability problem. I think putting

1197
01:16:15,925 --> 01:16:19,765
Speaker 2:  the battery on the headset is also a bad idea. Again, physics miracles, but

1198
01:16:20,025 --> 01:16:23,645
Speaker 2:  that's one thing you'll start to see. I wouldn't be surprised to see Apple

1199
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:27,285
Speaker 2:  use a less heavy material even if it's slightly less impressive. Again, if

1200
01:16:27,285 --> 01:16:30,245
Speaker 2:  you wanna get the price down, that's another way to do it and it'll also

1201
01:16:30,245 --> 01:16:33,365
Speaker 2:  have the delightful side effect of pulling some weight off of the device.

1202
01:16:33,585 --> 01:16:36,365
Speaker 2:  So again, there are little things Apple can do around the edges here, but

1203
01:16:36,365 --> 01:16:40,125
Speaker 2:  I think if you wanna see Apple do something more

1204
01:16:40,125 --> 01:16:43,885
Speaker 2:  wearable, it's gonna have to look like a different device. And I would

1205
01:16:43,985 --> 01:16:47,725
Speaker 2:  bet I wouldn't bet a lot, but I would bet a little that what Apple

1206
01:16:47,825 --> 01:16:51,645
Speaker 2:  is going to do next with the Vision Pro is going to look less like a

1207
01:16:51,895 --> 01:16:55,885
Speaker 2:  worse Vision Pro and more like something else entirely. I could be wrong,

1208
01:16:56,215 --> 01:16:59,965
Speaker 2:  maybe this is just wishful thinking because I would love for Apple to make

1209
01:16:59,965 --> 01:17:03,645
Speaker 2:  something like the Meta RayBan Smart glasses, but that connects to

1210
01:17:03,755 --> 01:17:07,485
Speaker 2:  Siri and all of my other devices as seamlessly as like a pair of AirPods

1211
01:17:07,485 --> 01:17:11,045
Speaker 2:  does. I want that. So maybe I'm just hoping for that. But You can see it,

1212
01:17:11,055 --> 01:17:14,885
Speaker 2:  right? Like all the things that AirPods are on your face plus

1213
01:17:14,965 --> 01:17:18,525
Speaker 2:  a camera that feels powerful, it feels like Apple. And you could see that

1214
01:17:18,525 --> 01:17:22,245
Speaker 2:  being the vision and then this being the Vision Pro. That's how you get to

1215
01:17:22,245 --> 01:17:24,645
Speaker 2:  wearability as far as I'm concerned because I don't think we're anywhere

1216
01:17:24,645 --> 01:17:28,245
Speaker 2:  close to a world in which You can build something that is as

1217
01:17:28,525 --> 01:17:32,485
Speaker 2:  powerful and capable as the Vision Pro and feels as good on my face as a

1218
01:17:32,485 --> 01:17:35,965
Speaker 2:  pair of glasses or even close. And some of the reporting, particularly from

1219
01:17:35,965 --> 01:17:39,045
Speaker 2:  Mark Kerman at Bloomberg has said that Apple is working on something more

1220
01:17:39,045 --> 01:17:42,605
Speaker 2:  like AR glasses, but that's still a couple of years away. That wouldn't totally

1221
01:17:42,695 --> 01:17:46,445
Speaker 2:  shock me, but again, from what I've seen from these meta

1222
01:17:46,445 --> 01:17:49,805
Speaker 2:  glasses, they don't have to do that much to be really useful to people.

1223
01:17:50,145 --> 01:17:53,725
Speaker 2:  Camera, speaker, microphone, incredibly powerful

1224
01:17:54,105 --> 01:17:57,165
Speaker 2:  and I think there's a lot more to do there and I think we might see Apple

1225
01:17:57,225 --> 01:18:00,765
Speaker 2:  do it sooner rather than later. Anyway, that's all outta conjecture. I'd

1226
01:18:00,765 --> 01:18:04,405
Speaker 2:  love to hear what you think. If you have had a Vision Pro for any of

1227
01:18:04,645 --> 01:18:07,765
Speaker 2:  the last five months, I wanna know what you think. We got a lot of feedback

1228
01:18:07,765 --> 01:18:11,045
Speaker 2:  from folks when we published our review and in those early days, but now

1229
01:18:11,045 --> 01:18:14,525
Speaker 2:  that things have settled, has the Vision Pro found a way into your routine?

1230
01:18:14,585 --> 01:18:18,445
Speaker 2:  Are you still using it all the time? Did you return it because it's $3,500?

1231
01:18:18,825 --> 01:18:22,805
Speaker 2:  Are you finding new ways all the time to use it? Do you use it for something

1232
01:18:22,925 --> 01:18:26,565
Speaker 2:  totally unusual that no one talks about? Tell us. I wanna hear everything.

1233

1237
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:06,805
Speaker 2:  gonna change a lot. It's gonna be really interesting. Also, read the version.com.

1238
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:10,285

1239
01:19:10,285 --> 01:19:13,925
Speaker 2:  dead period of the tech news cycle that ain't happening and it's about to

1240
01:19:13,925 --> 01:19:17,125
Speaker 2:  be phone season again, so it's gonna get crazy. As always, if you have thoughts,
