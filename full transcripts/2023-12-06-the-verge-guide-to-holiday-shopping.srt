00:00:02,515 --> 00:00:06,405
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of using gift cards to buy

3
00:00:06,405 --> 00:00:10,285
Speaker 2:  other gift cards. I'm your friend David Pierce and I am seemingly as

4
00:00:10,285 --> 00:00:14,005
Speaker 2:  always these days on a walk home from dropping my kid off at daycare. Do

5
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:16,485
Speaker 2:  you remember how a few weeks ago I told you that I was trying to like be

6
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:20,565
Speaker 2:  a person who walks and go on idea walks and get the blood flowing

7
00:00:20,565 --> 00:00:24,165
Speaker 2:  and get out in the world? It turns out that was a super fun,

8
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:28,125
Speaker 2:  good plan until it got to be cold. And now

9
00:00:28,725 --> 00:00:32,045
Speaker 2:  I have settled into the routine that I forget about every year, but always

10
00:00:32,045 --> 00:00:35,245
Speaker 2:  settle into again about this time, which is where I only go outside when

11
00:00:35,965 --> 00:00:39,765
Speaker 2:  absolutely a hundred percent necessary. And right now that is basically

12
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:43,165
Speaker 2:  to walk the dog or take my kid to daycare. And so

13
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:47,565
Speaker 2:  I'm outside right now and this is the last time I'll be outside potentially

14
00:00:47,565 --> 00:00:51,325
Speaker 2:  until this time tomorrow. It's a life. But this is what happens to me

15
00:00:51,325 --> 00:00:54,365
Speaker 2:  every year when it gets cold. So you know, I'll see you in April or something.

16
00:00:54,825 --> 00:00:58,365
Speaker 2:  Anyway, we have an awesome show coming up for you today. We are gonna spend

17
00:00:58,505 --> 00:01:02,045
Speaker 2:  the whole hour answering your questions at least to the best of our ability

18
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:05,605
Speaker 2:  about buying stuff. It's the season for buying stuff, right? It's deals,

19
00:01:05,835 --> 00:01:09,245
Speaker 2:  it's presents, it's weird gift exchanges with your

20
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:13,405
Speaker 2:  coworkers. It's just a time of year you have to buy a lot of stuff and also

21
00:01:13,505 --> 00:01:17,005
Speaker 2:  you're trying to tell people what to buy you. So we figured we might be able

22
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:20,805
Speaker 2:  to help. And whether you have questions about which laptop to buy

23
00:01:20,865 --> 00:01:24,845
Speaker 2:  or which MacBook to buy or which Smart home gear you should get into

24
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:28,805
Speaker 2:  or what odd gaming console you're excited about, we

25
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:31,965
Speaker 2:  took all of your questions, some of them super broad, some of them like

26
00:01:32,235 --> 00:01:36,165
Speaker 2:  hilariously impossibly specific and we're gonna answer as

27
00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:39,685
Speaker 2:  many of them as we can on the show today. We grabbed a couple of our best

28
00:01:39,685 --> 00:01:43,125
Speaker 2:  reviewers and smartest folks on the team and we're gonna go through as much

29
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:46,085
Speaker 2:  of it as we can. Thank you to everybody who's sent in questions. It's gonna

30
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:49,165
Speaker 2:  make this super fun and I have no idea if we're actually gonna help anybody

31
00:01:49,225 --> 00:01:52,885
Speaker 2:  but boy are we gonna try All, right? All of that is coming up in just a second,

32
00:01:53,145 --> 00:01:56,925
Speaker 2:  but first I gotta get home. I gotta, you know, get warm. I gotta take some

33
00:01:56,925 --> 00:01:59,765
Speaker 2:  cold meds. I don't know if you can hear in my voice, but my kid got sick

34
00:01:59,765 --> 00:02:03,085
Speaker 2:  and then my wife got sick and now I'm sick. It's great times all around then

35
00:02:03,085 --> 00:02:05,325
Speaker 2:  we're gonna get to it. This is the first cast, we'll be right back.

36
00:02:06,925 --> 00:02:10,305
Speaker 3:  Nearly 24,000 kids had their identity stolen in

Speaker 2:  Welcome back. We have a panel of stuff buying

48
00:02:53,325 --> 00:02:57,295
Speaker 2:  experts, which I believe is all of our titles here. Jen Tui,

49
00:02:57,295 --> 00:02:58,775
Speaker 2:  welcome back to The Vergecast. It's been a while.

50
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,765
Speaker 4:  Thank you David. It has been, it's lovely to be here. I'm sad we missed

51
00:03:02,795 --> 00:03:05,125
Speaker 4:  cooking our Thanksgiving Turkey together this year.

52
00:03:05,425 --> 00:03:09,045
Speaker 2:  We spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to one up that episode and

53
00:03:09,045 --> 00:03:11,765
Speaker 2:  never figured it out and so we never did a Thanksgiving episode. It's still

54
00:03:11,765 --> 00:03:14,285
Speaker 2:  one of my favorites we've ever done. If you haven't heard it, go find it.

55
00:03:14,785 --> 00:03:18,525
Speaker 2:  Dan Siffords here. Hi Dan. Hello and in the studio with Dan V

56
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:19,165
Speaker 2:  Song. Hello.

57
00:03:19,345 --> 00:03:20,085
Speaker 5:  Hey, what's up?

58
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:22,925
Speaker 2:  We have a lot of things to get through. I've assembled all of you because

59
00:03:22,945 --> 00:03:26,925
Speaker 2:  you each have, I would say both like good expertise but also

60
00:03:26,925 --> 00:03:30,525
Speaker 2:  just like broad knowledge of cool stuff and we need broad knowledge of cool

61
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:33,245
Speaker 2:  stuff. So let's just dive in. We got a bunch of stuff to get to. I've set

62
00:03:33,245 --> 00:03:37,005
Speaker 2:  this up, we're gonna do some like general questions at the beginning

63
00:03:37,105 --> 00:03:40,285
Speaker 2:  and then we have a couple of categories in which we got a bunch of questions.

64
00:03:40,285 --> 00:03:44,165
Speaker 2:  We're gonna go through those and then we have my favorite question that

65
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:46,725
Speaker 2:  we got through this whole process to do at the very end. So we're gonna get

66
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:50,165
Speaker 2:  into that. But let's start with a couple of just kind of grab baggy questions.

67
00:03:50,305 --> 00:03:54,085
Speaker 2:  The first one we got is, I'm gonna butcher everyone's name here and I'm very

68
00:03:54,085 --> 00:03:57,685
Speaker 2:  sorry in advance. I believe it's from Coine in The Vergecast email

69
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,925
Speaker 2:  who says, are there any good options if I want to swim and listen to music

70
00:04:01,145 --> 00:04:04,605
Speaker 2:  or dare I even say listen to podcasts. It seems to me that they all require

71
00:04:04,605 --> 00:04:07,845
Speaker 2:  me to have MP three files, which I don't even know how to obtain in today's

72
00:04:07,845 --> 00:04:10,725
Speaker 2:  streaming world. Ideally I'd like to keep my phone in the locker room and

73
00:04:10,725 --> 00:04:14,685
Speaker 2:  somehow stream music and podcast via the Apple watch. Also our bone conduction

74
00:04:14,685 --> 00:04:17,805
Speaker 2:  headphones the way to go or is the quality horrible? Let's break that into

75
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:21,765
Speaker 2:  two parts. VI want you to go first because we brought this up Chris WeCh

76
00:04:21,765 --> 00:04:24,805
Speaker 2:  and I had a long chat about MP three players a couple of weeks ago on this

77
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:28,445
Speaker 2:  show that made a lot of people feel a lot of feelings. But I wanna know first

78
00:04:28,665 --> 00:04:31,085
Speaker 2:  if you have a good answer to our friends' question here.

79
00:04:31,585 --> 00:04:35,445
Speaker 5:  My main answer is that there are a lot of trade-offs and there is

80
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:39,325
Speaker 5:  nothing yet out there that's going to kind of be everything

81
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:42,965
Speaker 5:  that I think this person is looking for because Bluetooth and

82
00:04:42,975 --> 00:04:46,925
Speaker 5:  water, not really great friends. There's a

83
00:04:46,925 --> 00:04:49,965
Speaker 5:  reason why you're having a hard time finding things that aren't MP three

84
00:04:50,045 --> 00:04:53,725
Speaker 5:  based and it's because Bluetooth is not meant to send things

85
00:04:53,725 --> 00:04:57,605
Speaker 5:  through water. It's just not, I'm not a swimmer, I'm gonna caveat

86
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:01,605
Speaker 5:  that I stick primarily to running because I should not be

87
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:05,525
Speaker 5:  let on a bicycle and I had to take swim gym in high school and that should

88
00:05:05,525 --> 00:05:09,405
Speaker 5:  tell you everything about my swimming skills. But that being said, I have

89
00:05:09,405 --> 00:05:13,285
Speaker 5:  a lot of friends who swim and the Apple watch, do

90
00:05:13,285 --> 00:05:16,805
Speaker 5:  you want the Apple watch to actually track your swim? Because if you want

91
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:20,245
Speaker 5:  it to track your swim and play content, you're out of luck.

92
00:05:20,665 --> 00:05:24,125
Speaker 5:  But if you just want it to be like a media player, there is something from

93
00:05:24,485 --> 00:05:28,325
Speaker 5:  H2O audio called the interval and it's, it's a

94
00:05:28,325 --> 00:05:31,925
Speaker 5:  wild device. If you look at it, it's like this little framework

95
00:05:31,985 --> 00:05:35,645
Speaker 5:  thingy and you like snap it onto your goggles

96
00:05:36,105 --> 00:05:39,445
Speaker 5:  and it's on the back of your head. So you just have the apple watch on the

97
00:05:39,445 --> 00:05:43,045
Speaker 5:  back of your head and it attaches to either bone conduction or ear ear

98
00:05:43,355 --> 00:05:47,205
Speaker 5:  earbuds and it's not streaming. You have to

99
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:51,365
Speaker 5:  like download offline playlists And technically

100
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:55,325
Speaker 5:  It works though, you know, I will say I have doubts about whether

101
00:05:55,395 --> 00:05:58,925
Speaker 5:  this thing will last long term just because

102
00:05:59,385 --> 00:06:03,085
Speaker 5:  you really want a waterproof wearable. Most

103
00:06:03,305 --> 00:06:07,085
Speaker 5:  of the advanced ones are not particularly strong at that.

104
00:06:07,235 --> 00:06:11,165
Speaker 5:  Like the Apple Watch is waterproof up to five ATM, which

105
00:06:11,165 --> 00:06:14,525
Speaker 5:  is what we consider swim proof. But that doesn't mean, it doesn't mean that

106
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:18,165
Speaker 5:  if you're diving to the depths of your pool a lot there,

107
00:06:18,165 --> 00:06:21,845
Speaker 5:  there's still a risk there. There's an inherent risk. So that's one

108
00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:25,325
Speaker 5:  option. And the other one is, is stuff like the Zy igo

109
00:06:25,995 --> 00:06:29,685
Speaker 5:  that one technically allows you to stream, but it's just because it has

110
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:34,885
Speaker 5:  a radio frequency transmitter on it so that it takes

111
00:06:34,945 --> 00:06:38,765
Speaker 5:  the Bluetooth playing from a source like your phone, which is you want it

112
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:42,045
Speaker 5:  to be in your locker room. So this might not actually work out for you,

113
00:06:42,545 --> 00:06:45,645
Speaker 5:  but it's taking it from a Bluetooth source and then there's like a

114
00:06:46,035 --> 00:06:50,005
Speaker 5:  frequency transmitter that converts the Bluetooth into something else

115
00:06:50,515 --> 00:06:54,005
Speaker 5:  that does work in water and that's a little pricier. So

116
00:06:54,385 --> 00:06:55,245
Speaker 5:  you know that's the

117
00:06:55,245 --> 00:06:56,765
Speaker 2:  Hackiest thing I've ever heard in my life.

118
00:06:57,275 --> 00:07:00,325
Speaker 5:  Yeah, so these are like, these are the, you know, swimmers Got it. Rough

119
00:07:00,605 --> 00:07:03,725
Speaker 5:  runners and cyclists. We can just use our regular Bluetooth headphones and

120
00:07:03,725 --> 00:07:07,245
Speaker 5:  like Bluetooth works fine in air but water just adds a different

121
00:07:07,415 --> 00:07:11,165
Speaker 5:  layer of physics to the problem so that there is a reason why most

122
00:07:11,325 --> 00:07:15,125
Speaker 5:  of the players you're finding are MP three based and and

123
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:18,965
Speaker 5:  also another reason why they are bone conduction based too because you know

124
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:22,445
Speaker 5:  like the earbuds, if if the earbud falls out

125
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:26,085
Speaker 5:  are you going to be able to dive to the bottom of the pool to pick it up?

126
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:30,205
Speaker 5:  So that's why like most swimming headphones you see they are gonna be the

127
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:33,805
Speaker 5:  type that goes around your, goes around your head or you know has a little

128
00:07:33,805 --> 00:07:37,685
Speaker 5:  like string attached to them. You're not gonna really get any true earbuds

129
00:07:37,865 --> 00:07:41,765
Speaker 5:  for for underwater use. So you know things to think

130
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:45,445
Speaker 5:  about. And to the second part of your question, are bone

131
00:07:45,535 --> 00:07:48,965
Speaker 5:  conduction headphones good? No,

132
00:07:49,355 --> 00:07:52,725
Speaker 5:  they're fine. They're fine if if you like base

133
00:07:53,115 --> 00:07:56,965
Speaker 5:  they're not great And so like as a runner, you know there's a lot of

134
00:07:56,965 --> 00:08:00,285
Speaker 5:  reasons and like there's time and place for using bone conduction headphones

135
00:08:00,345 --> 00:08:04,205
Speaker 5:  as a runner, I really like them when I am in an area and I'm worried that

136
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:07,845
Speaker 5:  a truck is gonna run me over if I've got like noise canceling headphones

137
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:11,725
Speaker 5:  on. But I really like bass heavy music for running just

138
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:15,605
Speaker 5:  to like drown out my thoughts of I want to quit, I want to quit, I want to

139
00:08:15,605 --> 00:08:19,565
Speaker 5:  quit. So if that's you bone conduction isn't really gonna be all that

140
00:08:19,985 --> 00:08:23,405
Speaker 5:  useful. And then podcasts is another problem

141
00:08:23,595 --> 00:08:26,965
Speaker 5:  because not every platform is gonna support

142
00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:30,645
Speaker 5:  podcasts. So like if you wanna listen to podcasts but you're primarily on

143
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:34,125
Speaker 5:  Apple music and that's how you're downloading your offline playlists, well

144
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:38,285
Speaker 5:  you're gonna need the Spotify if you wanna listen to audio books, audio books,

145
00:08:38,505 --> 00:08:41,285
Speaker 5:  you're gonna have to find something that supports audio books 'cause those

146
00:08:41,285 --> 00:08:45,205
Speaker 5:  files are encoded in a specific way. So there's

147
00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:48,965
Speaker 5:  just no easy way to do it. You can do it, there are people who do it. It's

148
00:08:48,965 --> 00:08:52,805
Speaker 5:  just you might have to learn how to get those MP three files or find

149
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:56,245
Speaker 5:  an option that lets you download offline playlist from your

150
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:57,685
Speaker 5:  streaming service of choice.

151
00:08:58,075 --> 00:09:01,165
Speaker 2:  It's tough. I will say I'm looking at the Zy Igo website right now and it

152
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:04,845
Speaker 2:  both looks like the hackiest thing in history and also like it might

153
00:09:04,985 --> 00:09:08,445
Speaker 2:  be kind of a magical thing like if it's as good as the reviews say

154
00:09:08,785 --> 00:09:12,685
Speaker 2:  it seems like kind of the perfect answer. But I am curious about bone connection

155
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:16,405
Speaker 2:  headphones in part because I feel like Dan, I swear like

156
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:20,045
Speaker 2:  the third day of The Verge you and I had a conversation about like when are

157
00:09:20,045 --> 00:09:22,765
Speaker 2:  bone conduction headphones gonna be the thing? They seem like a good idea.

158
00:09:22,765 --> 00:09:25,965
Speaker 2:  It's been so long they see like remember when like aftershocks was out here

159
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,805
Speaker 2:  being like bone conduction headphones are the future. They're still around.

160
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:32,965
Speaker 2:  They are still around and I feel like they are perfectly suited for

161
00:09:33,195 --> 00:09:36,925
Speaker 2:  when you just want to hear sounds and

162
00:09:37,225 --> 00:09:40,205
Speaker 2:  and that's all. You don't care about audio quality, you're just like, and

163
00:09:40,285 --> 00:09:42,325
Speaker 2:  swimming is actually a good example of this. Like you don't really wanna

164
00:09:42,355 --> 00:09:45,965
Speaker 2:  plug your ears but you want to be able to like kind of hear music

165
00:09:46,255 --> 00:09:49,805
Speaker 2:  which sounds like damning with faint praise but I kind of mean it don don't

166
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:53,085
Speaker 2:  know where are we with bone conduction headphones? Is it as bad as V says?

167
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:56,405
Speaker 6:  No, I know I think there are people who really swear by them and really like

168
00:09:56,405 --> 00:10:00,365
Speaker 6:  them but I think that outside of swimming the other use cases for bone

169
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:03,845
Speaker 6:  conduction headphones are running and cycling where you need spatial awareness

170
00:10:04,065 --> 00:10:07,925
Speaker 6:  for safety reasons. And I honestly think that the advancements

171
00:10:08,305 --> 00:10:11,965
Speaker 6:  in ambient modes on true wireless earbuds

172
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:16,005
Speaker 6:  have kind of made it so that you can wear standard earbuds

173
00:10:16,305 --> 00:10:20,285
Speaker 6:  and use the AirPods active noise, not the

174
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:23,205
Speaker 6:  noise canceling mode but the new one which is slipping my mind right now,

175
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,725
Speaker 6:  which kind of like automatically adjusts the, the cancellation to give you

176
00:10:26,725 --> 00:10:30,605
Speaker 6:  awareness of noises and the general ambient mode

177
00:10:30,605 --> 00:10:34,325
Speaker 6:  of AirPods is very good where you can still hear your music with a good audio

178
00:10:34,325 --> 00:10:38,245
Speaker 6:  quality and still hear everything around you for safety reasons. So I think

179
00:10:38,245 --> 00:10:42,165
Speaker 6:  for most people, unless you're really specific and you want bone

180
00:10:42,165 --> 00:10:45,765
Speaker 6:  conduction for very specific reasons, I don't know that I would recommend

181
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:49,005
Speaker 6:  bone conduction for, for most people looking to use them outside of like

182
00:10:49,205 --> 00:10:52,965
Speaker 6:  swimming, which is like obviously you don't want, you can't put AirPods in

183
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,445
Speaker 6:  in a pool and and you don't want them plugging up your ears anyways.

184
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:58,845
Speaker 2:  Jen, what do you do when you exercise? Are you a headphones while exercising

185
00:10:58,845 --> 00:10:59,085
Speaker 2:  person?

186
00:10:59,845 --> 00:11:03,325
Speaker 4:  I bought the Beats ones that stick in your ear. Beats Fit Pro.

187
00:11:04,425 --> 00:11:08,245
Speaker 4:  The purple ones? Yes, the purple. Well I did buy the purple ones, we both

188
00:11:08,245 --> 00:11:11,285
Speaker 4:  got the purple ones and then my daughter lost them so now I have boring gray

189
00:11:11,285 --> 00:11:13,045
Speaker 4:  ones but I loved those.

190
00:11:13,685 --> 00:11:14,645
Speaker 6:  I have the gray ones.

191
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:18,645
Speaker 4:  I bought boring gray ones 'cause I got renewed 'cause I'm like I'm not spending

192
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:22,485
Speaker 4:  this much money again but I'm, I'm not thee is the

193
00:11:22,485 --> 00:11:26,045
Speaker 4:  fitness girl here. I I'm the walk slowly around the block girl.

194
00:11:26,755 --> 00:11:30,605
Speaker 2:  Same. Alright, let's get to the next question. Oh, which is actually

195
00:11:30,605 --> 00:11:34,445
Speaker 2:  another headphones question. This is a good one. This one came from the

196
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:36,925
Speaker 2:  Hotline and it's from Daniel.

197
00:11:38,225 --> 00:11:41,805
Speaker 7:  Hi, my name is Daniel. I've become a bit obsessed with trying to keep

198
00:11:42,245 --> 00:11:45,925
Speaker 7:  a clean minimalist bag. I'm a remote worker and I

199
00:11:45,925 --> 00:11:49,885
Speaker 7:  constantly have to take, you know, meetings from coffee shops and I've

200
00:11:49,885 --> 00:11:53,765
Speaker 7:  been like mostly satisfied with my setup where I have a pair

201
00:11:53,765 --> 00:11:57,685
Speaker 7:  of quiet Comfort 40 fives or Donny XM fives that do a

202
00:11:57,685 --> 00:12:01,605
Speaker 7:  decent enough job of letting people hear me. But occasionally they

203
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:05,565
Speaker 7:  just stop working like there's a critical threshold of noise in a coffee

204
00:12:05,565 --> 00:12:09,445
Speaker 7:  shop where the directional mics just don't do the job anymore. And

205
00:12:09,445 --> 00:12:13,285
Speaker 7:  so now my bag has like a backup solution because I couldn't take the anxiety

206
00:12:13,345 --> 00:12:17,325
Speaker 7:  of not being able to do my job occasionally and that

207
00:12:17,675 --> 00:12:21,325
Speaker 7:  it's clunky. Like I don't want have two pairs of headphones in my bag, but

208
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:24,485
Speaker 7:  I also want to have like good noise cancellation for when I'm listening to

209
00:12:24,485 --> 00:12:27,845
Speaker 7:  music and I want to have a good microphone for when I'm doing my job and

210
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:32,045
Speaker 7:  I want a little help answering the question of what is the best way to do

211
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:33,325
Speaker 7:  this. Thank you for your time.

212
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,965
Speaker 5:  Just use the wired apple headphones.

213
00:12:36,345 --> 00:12:38,445
Speaker 2:  Yes, that's exactly what I was gonna say

214
00:12:38,555 --> 00:12:42,445
Speaker 5:  Because it's totally gonna save space in your bag and you know,

215
00:12:42,515 --> 00:12:46,165
Speaker 5:  Becca's done what, 5,000 videos at this point showing how good the quality

216
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:50,165
Speaker 5:  is on them. So I mean that's what I do. I just always have a wired

217
00:12:50,165 --> 00:12:53,645
Speaker 5:  pair in my bag. Actually Becca made me buy a pair for,

218
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:57,765
Speaker 5:  for work reasons. So I. I would just say those are super easy to stash

219
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:01,845
Speaker 5:  and a lot cheaper than a lot of the other options out there.

220
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:05,125
Speaker 6:  I I agree this was gonna be my recommendation as well. The only caveat is

221
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:08,525
Speaker 6:  they're not gonna do any noise canceling for you. So basically you just have

222
00:13:08,525 --> 00:13:12,365
Speaker 6:  to be willing to carry around both. I love the inclination to have

223
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:16,245
Speaker 6:  redundancy, I love redundancy. I'm the same person. but it does mean that

224
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:19,405
Speaker 6:  like you're, you're likely gonna have a set of over your headphones for your

225
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:23,045
Speaker 6:  noise canceled focus time and then when you need to hop on a call you just

226
00:13:23,045 --> 00:13:24,445
Speaker 6:  switch to the wired ones. I

227
00:13:24,445 --> 00:13:27,965
Speaker 2:  Think that's right. Every bone in my body wants to

228
00:13:28,895 --> 00:13:32,885
Speaker 2:  scold anyone who gets into a loud coffee shop and

229
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:36,685
Speaker 2:  then tries to take calls. Like it's just, it's the worst for

230
00:13:37,245 --> 00:13:41,045
Speaker 2:  everyone involved when people do that. But it's the holidays and so

231
00:13:41,045 --> 00:13:44,805
Speaker 2:  I'm not going to scold our friend Daniel for just trying to do his job while

232
00:13:44,805 --> 00:13:47,885
Speaker 2:  irritating every single other person in this coffee shop by shouting into

233
00:13:47,885 --> 00:13:48,965
Speaker 2:  his microphone. Well

234
00:13:48,965 --> 00:13:50,805
Speaker 5:  You don't know what Daniel's home life is.

235
00:13:50,965 --> 00:13:54,765
Speaker 2:  Daniel's gotta do what Daniel's gotta do. I get it. I do think like

236
00:13:54,765 --> 00:13:58,525
Speaker 2:  we've spent a lot of time talking about and testing various microphones

237
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:01,445
Speaker 2:  in various coffee shops on the show and what we have discovered is that you

238
00:14:01,555 --> 00:14:05,405
Speaker 2:  just can't beat the microphone on a big ass boom

239
00:14:05,425 --> 00:14:09,085
Speaker 2:  arm that comes all the way down to your mouth and you're just either going

240
00:14:09,085 --> 00:14:12,565
Speaker 2:  to have to get apple's wired headphones like we've been talking about or

241
00:14:12,595 --> 00:14:16,525
Speaker 2:  whip out the gamer headset and there just is no good third

242
00:14:16,525 --> 00:14:17,485
Speaker 2:  option. There's

243
00:14:17,485 --> 00:14:21,205
Speaker 6:  A reason Pilots headsets look the way that they do. Yeah when they're

244
00:14:21,205 --> 00:14:22,085
Speaker 6:  flying a helicopter.

245
00:14:22,565 --> 00:14:26,525
Speaker 5:  I mean if the, the RayBan Meta Smart Glasses could

246
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:30,405
Speaker 5:  actually pair with your laptop, I might've recommended that because

247
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:34,485
Speaker 5:  the mic is right on your nose and like you could watch our video review,

248
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:38,325
Speaker 5:  Becca did a mic test. It is like on par slash almost

249
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:42,645
Speaker 5:  slightly better than the wired apple headphones

250
00:14:42,825 --> 00:14:46,405
Speaker 5:  but they don't really pair easily with your

251
00:14:46,705 --> 00:14:49,645
Speaker 5:  laptop. So that was like one of the things that she pointed out as being

252
00:14:49,645 --> 00:14:53,605
Speaker 5:  kind of a miss there and then just smart glasses in general, you know

253
00:14:53,605 --> 00:14:56,205
Speaker 5:  that that is the thing that they're saying, right? You can use these for

254
00:14:56,205 --> 00:15:00,125
Speaker 5:  calls. They're not good enough for a coffee shop. Like just anytime you have

255
00:15:00,145 --> 00:15:03,965
Speaker 5:  any kind of ambient noise you have to crank the volume on them so loud that

256
00:15:03,965 --> 00:15:07,405
Speaker 5:  it kind of defeats the purpose. And you know, I've never heard anyone besides

257
00:15:07,405 --> 00:15:11,165
Speaker 5:  the ray bands tell me that I sounded good while wearing those so

258
00:15:11,305 --> 00:15:11,965
Speaker 5:  eh, you know?

259
00:15:12,195 --> 00:15:16,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah like really the, it is just the closer the microphone is to your mouth,

260
00:15:16,145 --> 00:15:20,005
Speaker 2:  the better it's going to sound is like basically all you

261
00:15:20,005 --> 00:15:22,245
Speaker 2:  need to know about all of this stuff. And the problem with the noise caning

262
00:15:22,245 --> 00:15:25,805
Speaker 2:  headphones generally is that your ears are not that close to your mouth.

263
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:30,005
Speaker 2:  That's a fun fact about how the world works. And I think like

264
00:15:30,585 --> 00:15:34,245
Speaker 2:  if there is a thing, and you all should tell me if this exists, that is like

265
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:37,445
Speaker 2:  a normal pair of noise canceling headphones onto which you can attach like

266
00:15:37,445 --> 00:15:40,085
Speaker 2:  one of those boom arms that is a microphone.

267
00:15:40,385 --> 00:15:44,125
Speaker 6:  So those things do exist. I forget the name of it right now but it,

268
00:15:44,225 --> 00:15:47,885
Speaker 6:  you did just remind me of there's a a device that you can literally

269
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:51,925
Speaker 6:  stick to the outside cup of any pair of headphones

270
00:15:52,025 --> 00:15:55,445
Speaker 6:  and then it has its own Bluetooth connection or dongle connection to your

271
00:15:55,645 --> 00:15:59,365
Speaker 6:  computer and it's basically a boom arm that goes across your mouth. It

272
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:03,325
Speaker 6:  is one of the jankier setups but basically it's like if you've

273
00:16:03,345 --> 00:16:07,045
Speaker 6:  got a pair of headphones that you really love the sound or comfort or whatever

274
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:10,285
Speaker 6:  features of, and they just don't have a mic or don't have a great mic, it

275
00:16:10,285 --> 00:16:14,125
Speaker 6:  allows you to retrofit a mic to it. I think that you are still gonna run

276
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:17,165
Speaker 6:  into the same similar problem. So even with a boom arm on that,

277
00:16:17,805 --> 00:16:21,045
Speaker 6:  you're dealing with Bluetooth connections, you're dealing with other, you

278
00:16:21,045 --> 00:16:24,725
Speaker 6:  know, factors. It's just another thing for your to manage and deal with

279
00:16:24,755 --> 00:16:27,605
Speaker 6:  instead of just plugging in the wired headphone, which is always gonna be

280
00:16:27,605 --> 00:16:28,765
Speaker 6:  the most rock solid connection.

281
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:31,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah, that's fair. Just

282
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,965
Speaker 5:  Carry your Yeti to the coffee shop, your Yeti

283
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:38,525
Speaker 5:  or your Sure. Just carry that. That's totally, no don't do that. That's,

284
00:16:38,555 --> 00:16:42,085
Speaker 2:  That might be worse. No, I think truthfully the like if you just want to

285
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:46,045
Speaker 2:  carry one thing I think like Jabra has pretty good headsets. They

286
00:16:46,045 --> 00:16:48,765
Speaker 2:  all have the boom arms, you're gonna look a little silly but at least folds

287
00:16:48,765 --> 00:16:52,205
Speaker 2:  up and has a decent set of headphones. That's probably the best. I think

288
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:54,805
Speaker 2:  they're called like the evolves or something and they're actually pretty

289
00:16:54,935 --> 00:16:58,125
Speaker 2:  solid. They're expensive but they, they are the best kind of

290
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:02,525
Speaker 2:  headphone looking headset working thing. You,

291
00:17:02,545 --> 00:17:06,485
Speaker 6:  You look like you are in a call center but that's why they

292
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:08,405
Speaker 6:  work because that's what they're designed for.

293
00:17:08,725 --> 00:17:12,445
Speaker 2:  A hundred percent because you are in fact in a call center. Yeah. Okay,

294
00:17:12,505 --> 00:17:15,685
Speaker 2:  that's enough headphone questions. Please leave me alone at the coffee shop

295
00:17:15,745 --> 00:17:18,285
Speaker 2:  and everything will be fine. We're gonna take a quick break and then we're

296
00:17:18,285 --> 00:17:21,045
Speaker 2:  gonna go back and we're gonna answer some computer questions and then we're

297
00:17:21,045 --> 00:17:24,165
Speaker 2:  gonna get into the really tough stuff, which is the smart home. We'll be

298
00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:24,285
Speaker 2:  right

299
00:18:47,705 --> 00:18:50,565
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. We got a bunch of questions from people that essentially

300
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:54,365
Speaker 2:  just want to know what computer they should buy. So let's help people buy

301
00:18:54,565 --> 00:18:57,965
Speaker 2:  computers. The first one we got is a voicemail from Benjamin. Let's hear

302
00:18:57,965 --> 00:18:58,205
Speaker 2:  it now.

303
00:18:59,425 --> 00:19:03,245
Speaker 7:  Hey Vergecast, it's Benjamin. I've got a classic form over function

304
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:07,005
Speaker 7:  dilemma I'm hoping you can solve for me. I'm looking to buy my partner a

305
00:19:07,005 --> 00:19:10,845
Speaker 7:  new laptop for the holidays but she has her eye on the 15 inch surface

306
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:14,965
Speaker 7:  laptop five specifically because of the all aluminum chassis. I

307
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:18,445
Speaker 7:  don't feel good about getting her a laptop with last year's mid-range specs,

308
00:19:18,445 --> 00:19:22,245
Speaker 7:  especially for such a premium price. Maybe I would feel different

309
00:19:22,305 --> 00:19:26,045
Speaker 7:  if the surface laptop six had actually come out this year. But

310
00:19:26,305 --> 00:19:30,045
Speaker 7:  I'm looking for recommendations for Windows laptops with an all metal chassis

311
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:34,005
Speaker 7:  and modern specs So I can steer her towards instead. She'll

312
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:37,725
Speaker 7:  mostly be doing light tasks like web browsing and streaming, but I wanted

313
00:19:37,725 --> 00:19:41,485
Speaker 7:  to have enough muscle holdup for a long time. She's also in grad

314
00:19:41,485 --> 00:19:45,285
Speaker 7:  school so great battery life would be a bonus. Is a MD still

315
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:49,045
Speaker 7:  the efficiency champ for laptops? Any advice is appreciated

316
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:53,125
Speaker 7:  before? I'm sure I'll ultimately buy her the Surface 'cause you know, happy

317
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,605
Speaker 7:  wife, happy life. Thanks

318
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:59,525
Speaker 2:  Dan Seifert help this person. What should Benjamin buy? It's not

319
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:02,005
Speaker 2:  the surface laptop. I just wanna put that out in front here.

320
00:20:02,115 --> 00:20:06,085
Speaker 6:  Well hold on. We we let's, I'm gonna give him two recommendations. Okay.

321
00:20:06,465 --> 00:20:09,765
Speaker 6:  He should ignore both of them and just buy the surface laptop. He specifically

322
00:20:09,765 --> 00:20:11,685
Speaker 6:  said this is the one his wife wants.

323
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:12,925
Speaker 2:  That's a fair point. And so

324
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:14,405
Speaker 6:  He should just buy the one she wants. That's a

325
00:20:14,405 --> 00:20:14,885
Speaker 2:  That's what

326
00:20:14,885 --> 00:20:18,725
Speaker 4:  I was gonna say. I know nothing about the laptops but buy her

327
00:20:18,725 --> 00:20:19,285
Speaker 4:  what she wants.

328
00:20:19,645 --> 00:20:22,605
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I mean there's, there's a lot of nice things about the Surface laptop.

329
00:20:22,665 --> 00:20:26,485
Speaker 6:  It is aging as he mentioned, it's not really super new. I think it came out

330
00:20:26,485 --> 00:20:30,285
Speaker 6:  in 2022 but it's got a great screen, great keyboard and

331
00:20:30,565 --> 00:20:33,885
Speaker 6:  it's a surface design so it's, it's a really nice premium design as I think

332
00:20:33,945 --> 00:20:37,405
Speaker 6:  are all the things that she likes. If we were to buy something else. I've

333
00:20:37,405 --> 00:20:40,605
Speaker 6:  got two recommendations. one of 'em is a little bit less expensive. It is

334
00:20:40,665 --> 00:20:44,565
Speaker 6:  the a Zen book 14 x. This

335
00:20:44,565 --> 00:20:48,170
Speaker 6:  is a 14.5 inch screen so it's a little bit smaller than the surface laptop

336
00:20:48,785 --> 00:20:52,645
Speaker 6:  but it's an ole display. So really awesome screen. It's got the latest

337
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:57,085
Speaker 6:  13th gen Intel processor. It's like comes with 16 gigs ram, half

338
00:20:57,085 --> 00:21:00,525
Speaker 6:  a terabyte of storage and you can get it for like 750 bucks, maybe even less

339
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:04,485
Speaker 6:  if you're shopping around. So it's a very up-to-date current model,

340
00:21:04,755 --> 00:21:08,685
Speaker 6:  it's still metal, it's not quite up to the build quality of the surface

341
00:21:08,865 --> 00:21:12,405
Speaker 6:  laptop but it's still, it's not a plastic piece of junk, it's still a a high

342
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:16,005
Speaker 6:  quality laptop. The other option is a larger

343
00:21:16,185 --> 00:21:20,085
Speaker 6:  one and since they mentioned that they want a 15 inch surface

344
00:21:20,105 --> 00:21:24,085
Speaker 6:  laptop and they like the aluminum chassis, I would suggest taking a

345
00:21:24,085 --> 00:21:27,765
Speaker 6:  look at the LG gram 16, the things to like about the LG gram

346
00:21:27,765 --> 00:21:31,405
Speaker 6:  16 is you got that 16 inch screen, it's huge. It's a 16 by 10

347
00:21:31,405 --> 00:21:34,965
Speaker 6:  aspect ratio so you got a lot of room on there. It's a very thin and light

348
00:21:34,965 --> 00:21:38,605
Speaker 6:  design, which is a signature of the Gram series and it has tremendous battery

349
00:21:38,605 --> 00:21:42,285
Speaker 6:  life. Comes with the latest 13th gen processors 16 gigs, gram a

350
00:21:42,285 --> 00:21:45,965
Speaker 6:  terabyte SSD Best Buy selling this for about 1700 bucks. So it's on the more

351
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:49,685
Speaker 6:  expensive scent end here but the Surface laptop's not a cheap

352
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:52,605
Speaker 6:  computer. So those would be my recommendations but at the end of the day,

353
00:21:52,865 --> 00:21:54,365
Speaker 6:  go buy your wife a Surface laptop. Five.

354
00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:55,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

355
00:21:55,645 --> 00:21:58,285
Speaker 5:  I mean you said it yourself. Happy wife, happy life.

356
00:21:59,315 --> 00:22:02,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah, don don't know about you guys but when I first started dating my now

357
00:22:02,715 --> 00:22:06,085
Speaker 2:  wife, she like the first Christmas we were together, she like literally gave

358
00:22:06,085 --> 00:22:09,525
Speaker 2:  me a list of like links and was like buy me one of these for Christmas. And

359
00:22:09,525 --> 00:22:13,405
Speaker 2:  I took this as a test to be like, okay, what cool thing can I buy that

360
00:22:13,405 --> 00:22:17,045
Speaker 2:  isn't on the list but shows that I read the and I did that and she was like,

361
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:20,765
Speaker 2:  why didn't you just buy me a thing on? She's like, I literally, I sent you

362
00:22:20,805 --> 00:22:23,725
Speaker 2:  a link of the thing and the color that I want. And So I learned very quickly.

363
00:22:24,145 --> 00:22:27,765
Speaker 2:  She sends me a list of links, I click on one of them and I click by and I

364
00:22:27,765 --> 00:22:30,805
Speaker 2:  give it to her for Christmas and she's very happy and it has been a winning

365
00:22:31,395 --> 00:22:34,165
Speaker 2:  move ever since. And it makes Christmas shopping the easiest thing in the

366
00:22:34,165 --> 00:22:36,245
Speaker 2:  world. And So I, I have learned the hard way that when they tell you what

367
00:22:36,245 --> 00:22:39,805
Speaker 2:  they want just just roll with it. So I think that's good advice.

368
00:22:39,835 --> 00:22:41,325
Speaker 6:  Yeah, buy your Spouse what they ask for.

369
00:22:41,465 --> 00:22:45,365
Speaker 2:  But also if you, if you want her to call in and us to talk her out of

370
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:49,045
Speaker 2:  the Surface laptop five because it is an old computer with old specs, I'm

371
00:22:49,045 --> 00:22:52,845
Speaker 2:  also happy to do that All. right. One more computer question, it's an email

372
00:22:52,845 --> 00:22:56,605
Speaker 2:  from Nathan. It says, hi friends, I have a 2020 Intel MacBook Pro right now

373
00:22:56,785 --> 00:22:59,845
Speaker 2:  and it is the base level which means it has some trouble when I use Excel

374
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:02,725
Speaker 2:  and PowerPoint. I'm looking into starting graduate school in the fall and

375
00:23:02,725 --> 00:23:05,965
Speaker 2:  would like for a Mac to be my main driver but I don't love the idea of spending

376
00:23:06,005 --> 00:23:09,325
Speaker 2:  a bunch of money on the soup up MacBook Pro. I also find myself needing software

377
00:23:09,325 --> 00:23:11,805
Speaker 2:  that is only available on Windows, which leads me to believe that maybe I

378
00:23:11,805 --> 00:23:15,525
Speaker 2:  should buy a Power full Tower PC to keep at home and buy a lower

379
00:23:15,585 --> 00:23:19,045
Speaker 2:  end M two MacBook Air and remote access the Windows computer when they need

380
00:23:19,045 --> 00:23:22,245
Speaker 2:  to do more processing. Does that make any sense or should I go for a more

381
00:23:22,245 --> 00:23:26,165
Speaker 2:  expensive MacBook Pro and not be it VI wanna know what you think having

382
00:23:26,315 --> 00:23:29,765
Speaker 2:  used the newest fanciest best MacBooks

383
00:23:30,705 --> 00:23:34,685
Speaker 5:  Ah yes, the, I still can't believe that the MacBook Pro

384
00:23:34,715 --> 00:23:38,205
Speaker 5:  16 inch that they sent me was $7,200.

385
00:23:38,675 --> 00:23:42,245
Speaker 5:  That configuration was just absolutely absurd.

386
00:23:42,785 --> 00:23:46,725
Speaker 5:  So like the one thing that I would have a question for Nathan is like what

387
00:23:46,945 --> 00:23:50,685
Speaker 5:  is his workload like? Just because you know, he

388
00:23:50,685 --> 00:23:54,365
Speaker 5:  mentions using that he needs Excel and PowerPoint but then also

389
00:23:54,445 --> 00:23:58,365
Speaker 5:  programs that are only available on Windows. So like

390
00:23:58,385 --> 00:24:01,525
Speaker 5:  if you have programs that are only available on Windows,

391
00:24:02,135 --> 00:24:05,725
Speaker 5:  maybe you do want the, the Powerful Tower pc. But

392
00:24:05,965 --> 00:24:09,725
Speaker 5:  having used the very, very souped up MacBook Pros and

393
00:24:09,725 --> 00:24:13,405
Speaker 5:  having an M two MacBook Air as my personal computer

394
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:17,405
Speaker 5:  right now, you know the MacBook Air is, is good enough for

395
00:24:17,405 --> 00:24:21,285
Speaker 5:  most of your like daily, you know, productivity type software.

396
00:24:21,285 --> 00:24:25,245
Speaker 5:  So long as you don't do what I did and get an eight gigabit, eight gigabits

397
00:24:25,245 --> 00:24:28,925
Speaker 5:  of memory, that was a dumb choice on my part. You need at least 16

398
00:24:29,545 --> 00:24:33,245
Speaker 5:  so you have to factor that into the price. So yeah, like

399
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:37,365
Speaker 5:  the, the one thing I'm hung up on is like needing programs that are only

400
00:24:37,365 --> 00:24:39,005
Speaker 5:  available on Windows So.

401
00:24:39,285 --> 00:24:42,845
Speaker 2:  I believe there is a solution to this problem, which is the Windows app,

402
00:24:42,935 --> 00:24:46,605
Speaker 2:  which is now a thing that exists as of just a couple of weeks ago and

403
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:50,525
Speaker 2:  I confess I have not used this at all personally, but

404
00:24:50,905 --> 00:24:54,885
Speaker 2:  the idea is you can now download Windows as an app and run what

405
00:24:54,885 --> 00:24:58,485
Speaker 2:  amounts to a virtual computer on your Mac computer. I

406
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:02,485
Speaker 2:  do not believe that you should buy a computer and also another computer and

407
00:25:02,485 --> 00:25:06,005
Speaker 2:  then use the one computer to access the other computer. Like yeah

408
00:25:06,235 --> 00:25:09,565
Speaker 2:  that way lies madness. Dan is the like

409
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:13,645
Speaker 2:  bootcamp exists, parallels exists, there's like, yeah

410
00:25:13,675 --> 00:25:16,125
Speaker 2:  kind of strategies here. Like what what do we do?

411
00:25:16,685 --> 00:25:19,565
Speaker 6:  Well first off I'll start with saying I don't think you need a MacBook Pro.

412
00:25:19,845 --> 00:25:23,565
Speaker 6:  I think a MacBook Air like V said is entirely capable of running the

413
00:25:23,765 --> 00:25:27,285
Speaker 6:  workloads of Excel and PowerPoint, particularly compared to an Intel MacBook

414
00:25:27,285 --> 00:25:31,205
Speaker 6:  Pro. Like the jump going from Intel to an M series processor is

415
00:25:31,205 --> 00:25:35,125
Speaker 6:  just enormous and you are gonna have Power des spare so long

416
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:38,725
Speaker 6:  as you equip it with at least 16 gigs of Ram and I would recommend

417
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:42,965
Speaker 6:  probably five 12 to a terabyte of storage for this next half of the recommendation.

418
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:47,085
Speaker 6:  And So I think Go MacBook Air is my my first recommendation.

419
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:51,485
Speaker 6:  The second thing is buy the MacBook and then explore these

420
00:25:51,485 --> 00:25:55,205
Speaker 6:  options for running your Windows apps on the MacBook. Whether that is the

421
00:25:55,205 --> 00:25:58,725
Speaker 6:  Windows app, whether that is Parallels Bootcamp might be a little weird that

422
00:25:59,005 --> 00:26:02,885
Speaker 6:  actually like requires you to use a Windows on arm build and it's a little

423
00:26:02,975 --> 00:26:06,765
Speaker 6:  wonky on the arm max. I think Parallels is a little bit more

424
00:26:07,005 --> 00:26:09,685
Speaker 6:  straightforward of a solution, but again, I personally have not directly

425
00:26:09,685 --> 00:26:12,925
Speaker 6:  used it, but you should try it out and see if it allows you to do the things

426
00:26:12,925 --> 00:26:16,885
Speaker 6:  that you need to do. And if it doesn't then you might have

427
00:26:16,885 --> 00:26:20,765
Speaker 6:  to go your route of setting up a tower PC or, yeah, I

428
00:26:20,765 --> 00:26:23,005
Speaker 6:  don't even think you really need to go a tower pc. I think you could go a

429
00:26:23,005 --> 00:26:26,325
Speaker 6:  pretty simple PC and that's, that's always plugged in at home and you can

430
00:26:26,325 --> 00:26:29,765
Speaker 6:  just remote desktop into it and and go from there. You know, Nathan's not

431
00:26:29,765 --> 00:26:32,645
Speaker 6:  the only one with this problem. I know Eli's been on the show many times

432
00:26:32,645 --> 00:26:36,365
Speaker 6:  talking about how his lawyer wife has to deal with very weird

433
00:26:36,365 --> 00:26:39,845
Speaker 6:  Windows based programs and trying to use him on a Mac is a huge pain.

434
00:26:40,145 --> 00:26:42,605
Speaker 6:  He, he's not the only one with this problem. And so that means there are

435
00:26:42,605 --> 00:26:45,845
Speaker 6:  people who are trying to solve it and So I, that would be my recommendation.

436
00:26:45,845 --> 00:26:49,645
Speaker 6:  Go get a good MacBook Air equip it well enough. You are still probably going

437
00:26:49,645 --> 00:26:53,005
Speaker 6:  to be spending close to $2,000 on this, but it's not 3000.

438
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:57,365
Speaker 6:  And see if you can get your Windows applications to run and if not then

439
00:26:57,785 --> 00:26:58,965
Speaker 6:  go to the next step. And if

440
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:02,885
Speaker 2:  It's the kind of thing that it's, it's like old outdated software that just

441
00:27:02,885 --> 00:27:06,285
Speaker 2:  only runs on Windows. Odds are that if you buy one of those like little

442
00:27:06,345 --> 00:27:10,245
Speaker 2:  $200 mini PCs things, it'll work fine for

443
00:27:10,245 --> 00:27:13,245
Speaker 2:  the occasional times you need to use it. So that, that would be my recommendation

444
00:27:13,245 --> 00:27:14,725
Speaker 2:  is that if you do end up buying two computers,

445
00:27:14,825 --> 00:27:18,765
Speaker 6:  Unless Nathan is saying these quote needing

446
00:27:18,965 --> 00:27:22,005
Speaker 6:  software that's only available on Windows is AAA games that he wants to stream

447
00:27:22,005 --> 00:27:22,125
Speaker 6:  to.

448
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:23,805
Speaker 5:  Oh good, no, no his Mac no

449
00:27:23,805 --> 00:27:26,725
Speaker 6:  The game then like then you do need that big power tower or you should just

450
00:27:26,725 --> 00:27:29,845
Speaker 6:  buy a gaming laptop. But I don't think that's what he was referring

451
00:27:29,845 --> 00:27:33,205
Speaker 5:  To. Just get a console. If you're gonna, if you really wanna be a Mac user

452
00:27:33,305 --> 00:27:36,565
Speaker 5:  and play AAA games, the console is just gonna be so much easier for you.

453
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:38,245
Speaker 5:  Like just, just just do it.

454
00:27:38,435 --> 00:27:42,245
Speaker 2:  There's so many PC gamers furiously sending you emails right now.

455
00:27:42,405 --> 00:27:43,485
Speaker 2:  VI just want you to know

456
00:27:43,485 --> 00:27:47,365
Speaker 5:  Don, don't just, just don't, just don't do it like, so like my spouse

457
00:27:47,545 --> 00:27:51,485
Speaker 5:  is a gamer or was a gamer and they had this problem too and they have just

458
00:27:51,485 --> 00:27:55,365
Speaker 5:  like thrown up their hands in the air and gone like f it of a PS five and

459
00:27:55,365 --> 00:27:59,085
Speaker 5:  an Xbox. That's just, just it. And you know, for their

460
00:27:59,085 --> 00:28:03,045
Speaker 5:  purposes, like are you really gaming on the go that you want it to be

461
00:28:03,185 --> 00:28:06,805
Speaker 5:  on your, your pc or do you want in their case a giant

462
00:28:07,255 --> 00:28:10,885
Speaker 5:  65 inch LG ed

463
00:28:11,185 --> 00:28:14,965
Speaker 5:  to to sit like two feet in front of 'cause they move up their chair

464
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:18,765
Speaker 5:  to two feet in front of the, the the so that all the racing games can go

465
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:22,925
Speaker 5:  directly into their eyeballs. I I don don't know, I just think just do the

466
00:28:22,925 --> 00:28:26,885
Speaker 5:  console and use the Mac for work. That's if, if if we

467
00:28:26,885 --> 00:28:28,685
Speaker 5:  are talking AAA games here

468
00:28:29,105 --> 00:28:32,925
Speaker 2:  I'm just saying MacBook Air Mini PC Steam deck

469
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:36,045
Speaker 2:  and you were just living your best life. Like that's the, that's the way

470
00:28:36,045 --> 00:28:39,805
Speaker 2:  to do it. Happy holidays to everybody. It's a huge victory. All right. Let's

471
00:28:39,805 --> 00:28:43,005
Speaker 2:  move on. Jen, I have terrible news for you. It's time to talk about matter.

472
00:28:44,065 --> 00:28:47,285
Speaker 2:  I'm so sorry we have to do this one more time. Before the year's over we

473
00:28:47,285 --> 00:28:50,565
Speaker 2:  got a bunch of smart home questions I would say, all of which I can distill

474
00:28:51,515 --> 00:28:52,965
Speaker 2:  into this voicemail from Chris.

475
00:28:54,425 --> 00:28:57,845
Speaker 10:  Hi, this is Chris from Los Angeles. Gotta ask going into buying season,

476
00:28:58,065 --> 00:29:01,925
Speaker 10:  what's up with Matter? What home tech am I allowed to buy? What home tech

477
00:29:01,925 --> 00:29:05,645
Speaker 10:  should I absolutely not buy? Is it the year for matter? Thanks

478
00:29:05,655 --> 00:29:06,005
Speaker 10:  Chris.

479
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:10,605
Speaker 5:  I also wanna know the the question because I'm buying a house, yay,

480
00:29:10,745 --> 00:29:14,525
Speaker 5:  my first house and I'm gonna go straight into the smart home.

481
00:29:14,585 --> 00:29:16,005
Speaker 5:  So, I need, I need this for

482
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:19,285
Speaker 2:  Me too. Yeah, we got a lot of versions of this question because I think

483
00:29:19,835 --> 00:29:23,565
Speaker 2:  this is the time of year to buy all this stuff, right? Like they're

484
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:27,405
Speaker 2:  fun stocking stuffers, they're fun gifts to buy people and

485
00:29:27,735 --> 00:29:31,485
Speaker 2:  every version of this question we got is essentially am I a

486
00:29:31,535 --> 00:29:35,405
Speaker 2:  moron for buying smart home stuff right now as we've talked about many times

487
00:29:35,415 --> 00:29:38,605
Speaker 2:  we're in the middle of transitioning to matter. Matter is kind of here, it's

488
00:29:38,605 --> 00:29:42,165
Speaker 2:  also kind of not here. Jen, talk us through it, it give us a gift guide here.

489
00:29:42,165 --> 00:29:42,685
Speaker 2:  What are we doing?

490
00:29:43,155 --> 00:29:47,005
Speaker 4:  Well, two points. The first would be friends, don't buy Friends Matter

491
00:29:47,005 --> 00:29:48,005
Speaker 4:  devices for Christmas.

492
00:29:49,715 --> 00:29:52,965
Speaker 4:  Okay? Just, just don't put that paint on them.

493
00:29:54,505 --> 00:29:57,485
Speaker 4:  And the second would be V can you wait a couple years to move in to your

494
00:29:57,485 --> 00:29:58,765
Speaker 4:  new house? No,

495
00:29:58,945 --> 00:30:01,085
Speaker 5:  My lease is up at the end of this month.

496
00:30:01,345 --> 00:30:05,165
Speaker 4:  Oh. So I know Eli's been going through this same issue with his house.

497
00:30:05,385 --> 00:30:09,365
Speaker 4:  You know, this is a tricky time and I would like to say it's unique in

498
00:30:09,365 --> 00:30:13,045
Speaker 4:  the smart home to be in this awkward situation where you are between protocols

499
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:16,645
Speaker 4:  and between devices and technologies. But no, this has been happening

500
00:30:16,695 --> 00:30:20,605
Speaker 4:  since I got into the smart home a decade ago. The smart home

501
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:24,685
Speaker 4:  is continually changing. It's never in a place where you're like,

502
00:30:24,715 --> 00:30:28,165
Speaker 4:  okay it's, it's here. This is right, this is the way to do it,

503
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:32,605
Speaker 4:  I'm happy. So really it's kind of like any tech, you know, I

504
00:30:32,605 --> 00:30:36,525
Speaker 4:  do always encourage people to buy, you know I, I think we do this

505
00:30:36,725 --> 00:30:40,645
Speaker 4:  a lot with our reviews. You know, the best you can afford that fits

506
00:30:40,645 --> 00:30:44,525
Speaker 4:  your need and that's still where it sits with Smart Home. I

507
00:30:44,525 --> 00:30:48,325
Speaker 4:  think Matter is going to help but it is not helping

508
00:30:48,505 --> 00:30:52,165
Speaker 4:  yet. And right now my number one recommendation about my matter

509
00:30:52,165 --> 00:30:55,805
Speaker 4:  devices would be only by matter devices that also work on other

510
00:30:56,085 --> 00:30:59,965
Speaker 4:  platforms, which is to, to sort of break that down a

511
00:30:59,965 --> 00:31:03,885
Speaker 4:  little bit. So Mat itself obviously not a platform but it does support

512
00:31:04,265 --> 00:31:07,045
Speaker 4:  all the major platforms and that's its biggest selling point And that's the

513
00:31:07,045 --> 00:31:10,845
Speaker 4:  one thing that I feel is good about MAT devices. If you want to buy a cheap

514
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:14,765
Speaker 4:  smart switch now for your Apple Home setup, you can go and do that.

515
00:31:15,065 --> 00:31:18,085
Speaker 4:  You really didn't have the option before matter and that's an area where

516
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:21,365
Speaker 4:  Matter has succeeded. Yay. Where it has not succeeded

517
00:31:22,385 --> 00:31:26,005
Speaker 4:  is in being able to pair to multiple smart home systems. So

518
00:31:26,725 --> 00:31:30,365
Speaker 4:  I have spent the last month tearing my hair out trying to

519
00:31:30,915 --> 00:31:34,845
Speaker 4:  pair my Phillips Hu platform, my Phillips Hu Bobs in my

520
00:31:34,845 --> 00:31:38,165
Speaker 4:  house, which I have had for over a decade 'cause that's one of those systems

521
00:31:38,165 --> 00:31:42,085
Speaker 4:  that's been around for a long time and it's been, it's been

522
00:31:42,085 --> 00:31:45,925
Speaker 4:  something of a, a complicated process and basically there there are

523
00:31:45,925 --> 00:31:49,445
Speaker 4:  still problems with that interoperability. So it's great if you want to

524
00:31:49,905 --> 00:31:53,805
Speaker 4:  buy a device and pair it to one smart home platform. But if you are one

525
00:31:53,805 --> 00:31:57,165
Speaker 4:  of the few, and I'm guessing there aren't a ton of people out here that wanna

526
00:31:57,185 --> 00:32:01,085
Speaker 4:  use two, three or four smart home platforms. But I'm also guessing

527
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:04,165
Speaker 4:  that if there are people that want to do that, they are listening to their,

528
00:32:04,525 --> 00:32:05,445
Speaker 2:  There are people yes welcome.

529
00:32:06,305 --> 00:32:10,045
Speaker 4:  So, and that's where things go sideways fast. So

530
00:32:10,365 --> 00:32:14,285
Speaker 4:  I paired my Hue bulbs all, all 40 bulbs I have in my house, 40

531
00:32:14,385 --> 00:32:18,325
Speaker 4:  and slowly collected over the years to Apple Home, worked

532
00:32:18,325 --> 00:32:21,965
Speaker 4:  great through Matter, paired them to Alexa, worked great next day

533
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:26,205
Speaker 4:  left they'd gone from Apple Home, they weren't there anymore and they weren't

534
00:32:26,205 --> 00:32:29,285
Speaker 4:  working anymore so they weren't responding which anyone that uses Apple Home

535
00:32:29,285 --> 00:32:32,285
Speaker 4:  will be familiar with. And then vice versa, the same thing happened with

536
00:32:32,285 --> 00:32:35,925
Speaker 4:  Alexa. It stopped working and So I have literally been tearing my hair out.

537
00:32:36,115 --> 00:32:40,005
Speaker 4:  It's not been fun. So Matter right now is still in

538
00:32:40,005 --> 00:32:43,805
Speaker 4:  its early stages. I remember when we first went to the launch party launch

539
00:32:43,805 --> 00:32:47,685
Speaker 4:  event for it, the, the head of the CSA, the organization behind it said

540
00:32:48,225 --> 00:32:52,125
Speaker 4:  Matter is a journey. It's going to take a long time and

541
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:54,805
Speaker 4:  if matter is a journey, I would say we're right about the stage where we've

542
00:32:54,805 --> 00:32:57,965
Speaker 4:  just stopped at the gas station to fuel up. So it's gonna be a really long

543
00:32:57,995 --> 00:33:01,805
Speaker 4:  time until we get where we need to be in terms of that

544
00:33:02,175 --> 00:33:06,125
Speaker 4:  solid interoperability. So right now, number one takeaway, if

545
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:09,285
Speaker 4:  you're gonna buy a device and you want it to work with a specific smart home

546
00:33:09,525 --> 00:33:12,165
Speaker 4:  platform and It works with Matter, that's great. But also make sure you have

547
00:33:12,165 --> 00:33:15,965
Speaker 4:  a backup so that it also works with Amazon Alexa over

548
00:33:16,045 --> 00:33:19,085
Speaker 4:  the cloud or Apple Home Kit as a home kit device because

549
00:33:19,815 --> 00:33:23,245
Speaker 4:  there are still a lot of interoperability problems. Unfortunately

550
00:33:23,625 --> 00:33:27,285
Speaker 4:  it is not the salvation of the smart home that we were all hoping,

551
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:30,805
Speaker 4:  but there's still potential. And the most important part about Matter right

552
00:33:30,805 --> 00:33:34,765
Speaker 4:  now I would say is future proofing. So having a device that works

553
00:33:34,765 --> 00:33:38,565
Speaker 4:  with matter now is a good thing for the future of your smart home,

554
00:33:38,745 --> 00:33:42,445
Speaker 4:  but it's not gonna solve your problems. Most of your problems today unfortunately.

555
00:33:42,745 --> 00:33:46,405
Speaker 4:  So one of the things they promised us or quite loudly said at the beginning

556
00:33:46,405 --> 00:33:49,725
Speaker 4:  of all of this was all your smart home devices that you currently have will

557
00:33:49,725 --> 00:33:53,605
Speaker 4:  work in matter going forward. So yay you don't have to go out and buy

558
00:33:53,605 --> 00:33:57,485
Speaker 4:  new stuff that does not seem to be really happening.

559
00:33:59,185 --> 00:34:02,805
Speaker 4:  And you know, Philips Hugh example, I just just

560
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:06,685
Speaker 4:  gave, I mean it does work with Matter but, but not well So, I've just reverted

561
00:34:06,685 --> 00:34:10,405
Speaker 4:  to using it the way it always worked, which it worked brilliantly. It has

562
00:34:10,745 --> 00:34:14,685
Speaker 4:  for many years and what's not broken in the smart home you should not

563
00:34:14,745 --> 00:34:15,325
Speaker 4:  try and fix

564
00:34:17,645 --> 00:34:21,605
Speaker 4:  'cause you always run into problems. So backwards compatibility has been

565
00:34:21,665 --> 00:34:25,165
Speaker 4:  one of the sort of real letdowns here. We've really hoped that a lot of our

566
00:34:25,165 --> 00:34:28,965
Speaker 4:  current devices would get upgraded to support matter and

567
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:32,885
Speaker 4:  either over wifi or Thread, which is the one of the main protocols that

568
00:34:32,885 --> 00:34:36,405
Speaker 4:  matter runs over. And it seems like from talking to companies out there that

569
00:34:36,545 --> 00:34:39,925
Speaker 4:  the, the kind of load that matter requires for

570
00:34:40,335 --> 00:34:44,005
Speaker 4:  their products is just, it's much heavier than they had expected.

571
00:34:44,425 --> 00:34:48,085
Speaker 4:  So they're not able to update these devices necessarily with

572
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:51,565
Speaker 4:  firmware. And if they do, sometimes that actually takes away function,

573
00:34:52,085 --> 00:34:55,765
Speaker 4:  which is one of the issues that Eve had with some of its devices. So

574
00:34:55,795 --> 00:34:59,325
Speaker 4:  it's smart plugs, they updated to matter and

575
00:34:59,895 --> 00:35:02,725
Speaker 4:  there was a potential that it was gonna take away the function for energy

576
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:05,965
Speaker 4:  monitoring, which was one of their best features. So they managed to get

577
00:35:05,965 --> 00:35:09,725
Speaker 4:  around that. But yeah, there's problems there. It's, it's not as easy as

578
00:35:09,725 --> 00:35:13,525
Speaker 4:  people had hoped. So VI think you should probably wait.

579
00:35:14,585 --> 00:35:15,565
Speaker 4:  Oh no.

580
00:35:16,385 --> 00:35:20,085
Speaker 2:  One of the things that I believe strongly about gift giving is that you should

581
00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:23,765
Speaker 2:  never give someone a to-do list. And I think one of the things that

582
00:35:23,765 --> 00:35:27,685
Speaker 2:  happens when you give somebody like a, a smart home gift in a lot of cases

583
00:35:27,865 --> 00:35:31,845
Speaker 2:  is like I've, I've now signed you up to make 10 phone calls and rewire your

584
00:35:31,845 --> 00:35:35,605
Speaker 2:  entire house. But so here's what I wonder and I'm curious

585
00:35:35,605 --> 00:35:37,925
Speaker 2:  kind of for everybody's perspective on this, this 'cause we're all sort of

586
00:35:37,925 --> 00:35:41,685
Speaker 2:  dealing with smart home stuff at various stages of, of installation.

587
00:35:42,355 --> 00:35:45,965
Speaker 2:  What is a good and not to-do Listy

588
00:35:46,095 --> 00:35:49,445
Speaker 2:  Smart Home gift you can give someone at this point in time

589
00:35:50,325 --> 00:35:51,925
Speaker 2:  a plug A plug. Yeah.

590
00:35:52,225 --> 00:35:55,965
Speaker 6:  You know, individual components are actually tough to recommend because you

591
00:35:55,965 --> 00:35:59,605
Speaker 6:  don't know what platform, unless you know you're this recipient

592
00:35:59,675 --> 00:36:03,485
Speaker 6:  very well, you might not know what platform they are using or prefer. That's

593
00:36:03,485 --> 00:36:06,965
Speaker 6:  true. So if you are going to do individual components, something like Jen

594
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:10,445
Speaker 6:  said that works on all of them is obviously the way to go. So

595
00:36:10,775 --> 00:36:14,565
Speaker 6:  smart plugs like for Miros, they work on all the major platforms,

596
00:36:14,995 --> 00:36:18,485
Speaker 6:  very reliable, we like them a lot, they're very inexpensive Hue bulbs are

597
00:36:18,485 --> 00:36:21,245
Speaker 6:  very, are are very reliable work on all the platforms.

598
00:36:21,585 --> 00:36:25,085
Speaker 2:  Hue Lights I have found by the way are are almost always a hit gift

599
00:36:25,155 --> 00:36:28,485
Speaker 2:  because they like, they set up really fast and they're like, they're fun.

600
00:36:28,585 --> 00:36:31,565
Speaker 2:  So like in three minutes you're just changing the lights in your house. Like

601
00:36:31,915 --> 00:36:35,365
Speaker 2:  yeah I have found I don, I don't know that anyone I've given them to as a

602
00:36:35,365 --> 00:36:38,645
Speaker 2:  gift has actually used them for very long, but they're a fun like, but

603
00:36:38,645 --> 00:36:42,365
Speaker 6:  They haven't complained about them. So yeah, so like there's, there's things

604
00:36:42,365 --> 00:36:46,205
Speaker 6:  like that I I think that for a few years everyone was given everyone smart

605
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:50,165
Speaker 6:  speakers and smart displays. I think we're kind of past that point and

606
00:36:50,705 --> 00:36:53,965
Speaker 6:  not everyone wants a smart speaker. If they did want one, they probably have

607
00:36:53,965 --> 00:36:57,125
Speaker 6:  it already. And so there that's a little tougher. I just think that like

608
00:36:57,225 --> 00:37:01,045
Speaker 6:  too, kind of like what Jen was saying, I think smart home

609
00:37:01,045 --> 00:37:04,885
Speaker 6:  products make a great gift for yourself and less

610
00:37:04,985 --> 00:37:08,165
Speaker 6:  of a great gift for someone else. Unless you know this person is

611
00:37:08,555 --> 00:37:12,445
Speaker 6:  already a smart home person and they've given you the list

612
00:37:12,445 --> 00:37:15,565
Speaker 6:  of things they want and there's smart home things on there and you just go

613
00:37:15,565 --> 00:37:18,925
Speaker 6:  buy them on that. I, I I think that like you are

614
00:37:19,845 --> 00:37:23,605
Speaker 6:  introducing a project to, to the uninitiated. My only

615
00:37:23,605 --> 00:37:27,525
Speaker 6:  caveat there is if you are going to be the project

616
00:37:27,965 --> 00:37:31,485
Speaker 6:  maintainer then maybe that's okay. An example my

617
00:37:31,485 --> 00:37:34,965
Speaker 6:  in-laws, I gave them a Google fa Google Home Hub

618
00:37:35,305 --> 00:37:38,765
Speaker 6:  or Nest hub, whatever it's called these days, the smart display a few years

619
00:37:38,825 --> 00:37:42,085
Speaker 6:  ago and I linked it up to Google Photos and now they automatically get photos

620
00:37:42,085 --> 00:37:45,645
Speaker 6:  of the grandchildren on their kitchen counter. I installed it, set it up

621
00:37:45,645 --> 00:37:48,725
Speaker 6:  on their wifi, they don't ever have to touch it, it just shows them pictures.

622
00:37:48,785 --> 00:37:52,445
Speaker 6:  And then I saw that my father, my father-in-law said it to a a five second

623
00:37:52,855 --> 00:37:56,685
Speaker 6:  changeover between the the images. So it's just speeding my images when I

624
00:37:56,685 --> 00:38:00,085
Speaker 6:  was over there, So I set it back to a minute. Everyone's happy but like you

625
00:38:00,085 --> 00:38:02,485
Speaker 6:  have to be prepared for that otherwise you are kind of introducing a project

626
00:38:02,485 --> 00:38:06,365
Speaker 6:  to them and, and and, and maybe that's not the best gifting type of

627
00:38:06,365 --> 00:38:06,525
Speaker 6:  thing.

628
00:38:06,935 --> 00:38:10,045
Speaker 2:  Photo frames are a good one. My mother-in-law loves them.

629
00:38:10,385 --> 00:38:13,885
Speaker 4:  That's the nice thing about the smart displays is being able to set up that

630
00:38:13,885 --> 00:38:17,325
Speaker 4:  feature and there are ones that aren't smart displays if if people don't

631
00:38:17,325 --> 00:38:21,245
Speaker 4:  want the speakers and microphones as well, like Skylight and Aura. But

632
00:38:21,505 --> 00:38:24,725
Speaker 4:  in terms of yes actual smart home devices, it's kinda like, I mean would

633
00:38:24,725 --> 00:38:28,605
Speaker 4:  you buy someone a a tap a faucet for for Christmas?

634
00:38:28,705 --> 00:38:32,565
Speaker 4:  You know it's like those types of, you know, I'd love a smart tap,

635
00:38:32,725 --> 00:38:36,525
Speaker 4:  a smart faucet myself but so it's my English, my English is in,

636
00:38:37,955 --> 00:38:41,085
Speaker 4:  it's just, there's slightly odd things. Oh here's a smart switch. Go wire

637
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:45,045
Speaker 4:  it into your house as much as as you used to gonna get

638
00:38:45,045 --> 00:38:48,805
Speaker 4:  out of it. I think the one area that perhaps I would say, okay this would

639
00:38:48,805 --> 00:38:52,645
Speaker 4:  be kind of cool is when you know they have a problem and there is a

640
00:38:52,645 --> 00:38:56,205
Speaker 4:  smart home device out there that will solve it. For example, like a smart

641
00:38:56,205 --> 00:39:00,085
Speaker 4:  garage door opener or you know if your granddad or your

642
00:39:00,365 --> 00:39:02,965
Speaker 4:  neighbor is always leaving their garage door open, you're like look here's

643
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:06,925
Speaker 4:  a smart garage door controller this look how you can do this. And every

644
00:39:06,925 --> 00:39:10,125
Speaker 4:  time you give someone a smart gift like that, you should have a little coupon

645
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:12,965
Speaker 4:  next to it that says I will come and install it and set it up for you.

646
00:39:14,345 --> 00:39:18,165
Speaker 2:  That's good. Yeah and then I will not maintain it over

647
00:39:18,165 --> 00:39:22,085
Speaker 2:  time. Like this comes with seven days of service and then and then

648
00:39:22,105 --> 00:39:25,885
Speaker 2:  no more beyond that. That's long your warranty lasts. V if are you thinking

649
00:39:25,885 --> 00:39:28,605
Speaker 2:  about smart home gifts? What are you, what are you gonna give or receive

650
00:39:28,605 --> 00:39:28,965
Speaker 2:  this year?

651
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:33,565
Speaker 5:  No So I. Think I'm going to follow everyone's advice and do all

652
00:39:33,565 --> 00:39:37,245
Speaker 5:  the research ahead of time. AKA Jen, I'm sliding into your DMM

653
00:39:37,565 --> 00:39:41,485
Speaker 5:  sometime soon and then I'm gonna make a list and then send that

654
00:39:41,485 --> 00:39:44,765
Speaker 5:  list to everyone and say only buy the things on this list

655
00:39:45,305 --> 00:39:49,045
Speaker 5:  for me. But yeah, I'm basically, I wanna thermostat is like number

656
00:39:49,205 --> 00:39:53,165
Speaker 5:  one on my list just to, you know, lower my utility bills

657
00:39:53,465 --> 00:39:57,125
Speaker 5:  and then you know, further down the line I'm gonna get one of those

658
00:39:57,235 --> 00:40:01,165
Speaker 5:  toto toilets in the bidet So I. It's further, further down the

659
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:01,365
Speaker 5:  line.

660
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:05,205
Speaker 2:  That's a good gift. That's like a slightly awkward thing to talk about

661
00:40:05,715 --> 00:40:08,965
Speaker 2:  potentially at the holidays but if, if you're that kind of family, like get

662
00:40:08,965 --> 00:40:09,725
Speaker 2:  after it. I

663
00:40:09,725 --> 00:40:13,565
Speaker 6:  Bought one last year for the fans like the family gift or for

664
00:40:13,675 --> 00:40:15,805
Speaker 6:  like my wife and I to use and I love

665
00:40:15,805 --> 00:40:19,565
Speaker 5:  It. Yeah you know you will change someone's life by introducing them to a

666
00:40:19,635 --> 00:40:21,525
Speaker 5:  toto that that is true I

667
00:40:21,525 --> 00:40:23,765
Speaker 2:  Don Dunno if that counts as smart home but it's high tech So. I'll take it.

668
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:27,005
Speaker 2:  This will do All right? We gotta take one more break and then we have a few

669
00:40:27,005 --> 00:40:28,685
Speaker 2:  more questions and we'll get out here. We'll be right back.

689
00:41:48,385 --> 00:41:51,005
Speaker 2:  All. right, we're back All, right Jen, one more smart home question before

690
00:41:51,005 --> 00:41:54,965
Speaker 2:  we get out of this matter. Chaos. This is an email

691
00:41:54,995 --> 00:41:58,565
Speaker 2:  from Alec and this is like not specifically a

692
00:41:58,765 --> 00:42:01,685
Speaker 2:  Christmas holiday question but this is actually a thing I've heard a bunch

693
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:05,285
Speaker 2:  of people buy for the holidays so I'm gonna, we're gonna do it anyway. The

694
00:42:05,285 --> 00:42:07,765
Speaker 2:  email says last spring Google announced that it will be getting rid of the

695
00:42:07,765 --> 00:42:11,445
Speaker 2:  Nest security products that it support in April, 2024 and that Nest customers

696
00:42:11,605 --> 00:42:15,365
Speaker 2:  can get a free set of a DT hardware to replace it. Problem is the A DT hardware

697
00:42:15,365 --> 00:42:17,885
Speaker 2:  doesn't seem very good to me and I'd rather have a better alternative. It

698
00:42:17,885 --> 00:42:21,045
Speaker 2:  can work with my remaining Nest products doorbell, smoke detector, et cetera,

699
00:42:21,225 --> 00:42:24,765
Speaker 2:  as well as Apple Home and Google Home. I'm left wondering what a good alternative

700
00:42:24,765 --> 00:42:28,725
Speaker 2:  is to nest security that isn't a DT lots of options but no clear good direction.

701
00:42:29,075 --> 00:42:33,045
Speaker 2:  This definitely falls under the do not buy someone a whole security

702
00:42:33,045 --> 00:42:35,805
Speaker 2:  system for their house unless you know what they're doing. But if you want

703
00:42:35,805 --> 00:42:38,685
Speaker 2:  to give this to you know yourself or your partner or your family for the

704
00:42:38,685 --> 00:42:42,365
Speaker 2:  holidays seems like a reasonably good gift. Can we help this person? This,

705
00:42:42,395 --> 00:42:45,725
Speaker 2:  this sort of sunset setting of nest thing has been going on for a while and

706
00:42:45,725 --> 00:42:49,405
Speaker 2:  does sort of seem like a lot of people might just be left in the lurch. Is

707
00:42:49,405 --> 00:42:50,365
Speaker 2:  there a good way out of this?

708
00:42:50,755 --> 00:42:54,325
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's a tricky one. This, it's such a shame. The Nest secure system

709
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:57,805
Speaker 4:  actually was, was a pretty neat system. I was very sad when it went away,

710
00:42:57,835 --> 00:43:01,045
Speaker 4:  what it did so well and which I do have some

711
00:43:01,205 --> 00:43:04,245
Speaker 4:  alternatives for. So hopefully we'll have a good solution here. But what

712
00:43:04,245 --> 00:43:07,365
Speaker 4:  it did so well was it took home security,

713
00:43:08,095 --> 00:43:11,525
Speaker 4:  which is full of tiny little white plastic things you have to stick around

714
00:43:11,525 --> 00:43:14,925
Speaker 4:  your house and digest it all into one tiny little sensor

715
00:43:15,545 --> 00:43:19,325
Speaker 4:  and a nice little central hub. So it was a beautiful

716
00:43:19,325 --> 00:43:23,165
Speaker 4:  product in that respect. It was overpriced and it had a, a fair

717
00:43:23,165 --> 00:43:27,005
Speaker 4:  number of other flaws but you know, that core functionality was really good.

718
00:43:27,025 --> 00:43:30,925
Speaker 4:  And then also the NFC tag so you didn't have to worry about running in and

719
00:43:30,925 --> 00:43:34,525
Speaker 4:  like pressing the keypad thing, which still gives me nervous sort of hives

720
00:43:34,525 --> 00:43:37,725
Speaker 4:  when I have to do because I do it all the time when I'm testing these devices

721
00:43:37,755 --> 00:43:41,645
Speaker 4:  like oh no, the police is gonna show up. But anyway, so

722
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:45,085
Speaker 4:  it, it had some great solutions there and this is what I like about the smart

723
00:43:45,085 --> 00:43:49,045
Speaker 4:  home when it takes a sort of legacy product and does makes

724
00:43:49,045 --> 00:43:52,725
Speaker 4:  it smart, makes it, oh wow, this is so much better than it was before. And

725
00:43:52,775 --> 00:43:56,605
Speaker 4:  there are a couple of solutions out there that will fill that Nest

726
00:43:56,605 --> 00:44:00,485
Speaker 4:  secure shaped hole. Unfortunately not entirely precisely.

727
00:44:00,485 --> 00:44:04,405
Speaker 4:  There's a few sort of caveats and you know, choices you have to make.

728
00:44:04,405 --> 00:44:07,805
Speaker 4:  So you're not gonna get some of the, the benefits that Nest Secure had. But

729
00:44:08,025 --> 00:44:11,965
Speaker 4:  one, what I love about these two is that they both offer that, that all in

730
00:44:11,965 --> 00:44:15,565
Speaker 4:  one sensor product. So the two options that I really like are

731
00:44:15,675 --> 00:44:19,405
Speaker 4:  Arlo Secure and then the Eco B security system. So they

732
00:44:19,405 --> 00:44:23,085
Speaker 4:  both have these all in one sensors and Arlo Secure is

733
00:44:23,365 --> 00:44:27,245
Speaker 4:  probably gonna be the best solution for our caller here because it's

734
00:44:27,275 --> 00:44:30,405
Speaker 4:  very well integrated with Google. It integrates with

735
00:44:31,755 --> 00:44:35,645
Speaker 4:  into the Google home system really well. The cameras and such, like

736
00:44:36,065 --> 00:44:39,925
Speaker 4:  the actual security system integration, it gets a little tricky when you

737
00:44:39,925 --> 00:44:43,805
Speaker 4:  integrate security systems into other systems because you want

738
00:44:43,805 --> 00:44:47,565
Speaker 4:  them to be secure. So there's a lot of sort of caveats about making,

739
00:44:47,565 --> 00:44:51,485
Speaker 4:  giving other platforms access to your security system. But in terms

740
00:44:51,485 --> 00:44:54,885
Speaker 4:  of using, you know, like your Google Home app and integrating with your cameras,

741
00:44:55,195 --> 00:44:59,045
Speaker 4:  Arlo Secure is probably gonna be your best solution and it's really relatively

742
00:44:59,045 --> 00:45:02,645
Speaker 4:  inexpensive. It's like $200 to get started with the keypad and two

743
00:45:02,645 --> 00:45:06,085
Speaker 4:  sensors and these sensors are awesome. They're all in one multisensor and

744
00:45:06,085 --> 00:45:09,965
Speaker 4:  they do eight different things, which is kind of impressive. Wow.

745
00:45:10,345 --> 00:45:14,045
Speaker 4:  So their contact sensors, motion sensors, ambient light

746
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:17,845
Speaker 4:  sensors, temperature sensors, they can also, the system itself can

747
00:45:17,845 --> 00:45:21,765
Speaker 4:  also listen for smoke and co alarms. So you don't need, you know, all

748
00:45:21,765 --> 00:45:25,525
Speaker 4:  the other sensors that most security systems come with and

749
00:45:25,635 --> 00:45:29,365
Speaker 4:  also they're leak detectors. You can't use them as a leak detector

750
00:45:29,705 --> 00:45:33,365
Speaker 4:  and a contact sensor at the same time but you can, you know, you can

751
00:45:33,365 --> 00:45:36,525
Speaker 4:  choose, pick and choose what you want them to do, which is really neat. And

752
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:40,085
Speaker 4:  if you use Arlo cameras you actually can get video

753
00:45:40,085 --> 00:45:43,965
Speaker 4:  verification, which is a pretty key part of any kind of security system these

754
00:45:43,965 --> 00:45:47,725
Speaker 4:  days if you sign up for professional monitoring and that was something that

755
00:45:47,725 --> 00:45:51,565
Speaker 4:  Nest Secure didn't offer. So that's where police will only come to your

756
00:45:51,565 --> 00:45:55,485
Speaker 4:  house if they can actually verify that something's wrong and not that you

757
00:45:55,485 --> 00:45:59,285
Speaker 4:  just forgot You don, you forgot to know how to disarm the system. Right.

758
00:45:59,805 --> 00:46:03,645
Speaker 4:  Pressing the buttons. So the Arlo secure is, is a good one. And

759
00:46:03,765 --> 00:46:07,605
Speaker 4:  then the Eco B secure system, very similar. It also has

760
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:11,445
Speaker 4:  these sensors that are contact and motion in

761
00:46:11,465 --> 00:46:15,165
Speaker 4:  one but they don't do all the other stuff. But what they do, and this is

762
00:46:15,165 --> 00:46:18,245
Speaker 4:  something that V might be interested in, is they do sync with your thermostat

763
00:46:18,585 --> 00:46:22,405
Speaker 4:  and so if you leave your door open it will, you can

764
00:46:22,565 --> 00:46:26,405
Speaker 4:  set it to automatically turn your heating or AC off

765
00:46:26,475 --> 00:46:29,525
Speaker 4:  when the door's left open just so that you're not, you know, yeah, that's

766
00:46:29,525 --> 00:46:32,605
Speaker 4:  neat. Accidentally cooling the outdoors or heating or as

767
00:46:32,605 --> 00:46:34,725
Speaker 2:  My mom used to say, we're not heating outside here.

768
00:46:34,915 --> 00:46:38,805
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So that's a neat sort of extra feature, which I really

769
00:46:38,805 --> 00:46:41,725
Speaker 4:  like. And that's the kind of thing, you know, security systems are boring,

770
00:46:42,155 --> 00:46:45,685
Speaker 4:  they're kind of expensive. You're paying monthly for them most of the time

771
00:46:45,825 --> 00:46:48,485
Speaker 4:  and especially if you have professional monitoring. So it's kind of cool

772
00:46:48,485 --> 00:46:51,765
Speaker 4:  when they can do something else useful and helpful and all of these

773
00:46:52,355 --> 00:46:56,285
Speaker 4:  both on Arlo Secure and e be, you can use as motion sensors and contact

774
00:46:56,285 --> 00:47:00,125
Speaker 4:  sensors in your smart home. So you, the door opens, the lights can

775
00:47:00,125 --> 00:47:03,725
Speaker 4:  turn on, you can set motion automations and those types of

776
00:47:04,715 --> 00:47:08,445
Speaker 4:  home automation setups, which you know, are really useful in your house

777
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:12,205
Speaker 4:  as well as also protecting you potentially if someone comes and tries to

778
00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:15,885
Speaker 4:  break in. So those are both good options. The other one would be Abode,

779
00:47:16,215 --> 00:47:19,925
Speaker 4:  which has, they're a bit more like traditional security

780
00:47:20,105 --> 00:47:24,045
Speaker 4:  system. They have all the different sensors, but they also work as a

781
00:47:24,045 --> 00:47:27,965
Speaker 4:  Z-Wave hub. So if you want to connect to a broader smart home with

782
00:47:28,065 --> 00:47:31,725
Speaker 4:  Z-Wave devices, the, and all three of these do work with Apple Home.

783
00:47:32,155 --> 00:47:36,125
Speaker 4:  They all work with Google to some extent and they all

784
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:39,645
Speaker 4:  work with Amazon Alexa assistant too. So you have

785
00:47:39,955 --> 00:47:43,845
Speaker 4:  kind of broad support there on the platforms. They all also have cameras

786
00:47:43,955 --> 00:47:47,645
Speaker 4:  with them. So it does, our caller does mention he already has some Google

787
00:47:47,645 --> 00:47:51,405
Speaker 4:  cameras, but if you wanted to add more cameras, you can use cameras

788
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:55,085
Speaker 4:  from all three of these systems in there. The, the E could be cameras and

789
00:47:55,085 --> 00:47:58,565
Speaker 4:  the other cameras are, are really quite good. The abode cameras I would maybe

790
00:47:58,575 --> 00:48:02,485
Speaker 4:  stick clear of, so there's some three good options there and three

791
00:48:02,485 --> 00:48:06,325
Speaker 4:  good price points too. They all, I think the cheapest actually is the abode,

792
00:48:06,325 --> 00:48:10,245
Speaker 4:  which starts $160. The A DT stuff unfortunately

793
00:48:11,115 --> 00:48:14,565
Speaker 4:  just really wasn't very impressive. I read a lot of people

794
00:48:14,805 --> 00:48:18,685
Speaker 4:  complaining about that when it came out, but we did actually report a couple

795
00:48:18,685 --> 00:48:21,965
Speaker 4:  months ago that it looks like a DT is working on another

796
00:48:22,665 --> 00:48:26,565
Speaker 4:  system where they're more tightly integrated with the Nest devices

797
00:48:27,025 --> 00:48:31,005
Speaker 4:  and have some slightly nicer looking hardware. So if you can wait, you

798
00:48:31,005 --> 00:48:34,965
Speaker 4:  might wanna wait and see how that pans out. But otherwise I would look into

799
00:48:34,985 --> 00:48:37,485
Speaker 4:  one of those three options that I mentioned. I think you'll probably find

800
00:48:37,485 --> 00:48:38,245
Speaker 4:  something there that you'd like.

801
00:48:38,405 --> 00:48:42,325
Speaker 2:  I feel like our takeaway so far is that holiday season 2027

802
00:48:42,585 --> 00:48:46,165
Speaker 2:  is gonna be like sick for the smart home. It's gonna be so good

803
00:48:46,665 --> 00:48:50,045
Speaker 2:  and until then just, you know, close your eyes and point at something and,

804
00:48:50,045 --> 00:48:53,125
Speaker 2:  and we'll try. No, I think that's, that's super helpful. I'm actually gonna,

805
00:48:53,245 --> 00:48:57,085
Speaker 2:  I think go probably by one of those this holiday season stuff's on good sale.

806
00:48:57,165 --> 00:48:59,445
Speaker 2:  I guess that's part of the reason everybody buys stuff is just everything's

807
00:48:59,445 --> 00:49:02,845
Speaker 2:  on sale right now. Alright, a few more questions then we're gonna get outta

808
00:49:02,845 --> 00:49:06,645
Speaker 2:  here. We got a couple of questions about gaming, specifically handheld gaming.

809
00:49:07,035 --> 00:49:09,045
Speaker 2:  This first one is voicemail from Sean.

810
00:49:10,425 --> 00:49:14,205
Speaker 7:  Hey, this is Sean from Ohio. Christmas is coming up and I

811
00:49:14,205 --> 00:49:17,525
Speaker 7:  have a 7-year-old son at home that I've is really in the video games.

812
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:21,765
Speaker 7:  I've been noticing on TikTok a lot of these handheld,

813
00:49:21,785 --> 00:49:24,925
Speaker 7:  almost Game Boy esque video game emulators.

814
00:49:25,585 --> 00:49:28,965
Speaker 7:  I'm wondering if those are any good if emulator

815
00:49:29,085 --> 00:49:32,965
Speaker 7:  handheld gaming is very good. I've heard of the steam

816
00:49:32,965 --> 00:49:36,485
Speaker 7:  deck and we own a switch, but I'd love to get him something that I can just

817
00:49:36,485 --> 00:49:40,325
Speaker 7:  load up a bunch of games. Also, I'm a Mac user, So I. Don't know

818
00:49:40,325 --> 00:49:44,125
Speaker 7:  if that prohibits me or kind of

819
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:47,845
Speaker 7:  detracts from being able to do that anyways. Looking for a game device

820
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,325
Speaker 7:  to buy for my son. Love to know your thoughts. Thanks.

821
00:49:50,775 --> 00:49:54,125
Speaker 2:  There are two correct answers to this question. I would say one

822
00:49:54,705 --> 00:49:58,525
Speaker 2:  is a device called the Retro Pocket, which is one of those things that comes

823
00:49:58,525 --> 00:50:01,885
Speaker 2:  from Amazon and ships with like a million built-in games that you can play.

824
00:50:02,435 --> 00:50:05,245
Speaker 2:  Some of them don't work very well, some of them are like

825
00:50:06,135 --> 00:50:09,565
Speaker 2:  porny and weird on a lot of these emulator devices, but it's also,

826
00:50:09,975 --> 00:50:13,845
Speaker 2:  there are some very good games. So that's a good like all in one emulator

827
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:17,565
Speaker 2:  kind of system. How old is your son if they're Porny

828
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:21,605
Speaker 2:  seven, you know, whatever. I'm not here to litigate. Oh okay. I'm not, I'm

829
00:50:21,665 --> 00:50:25,405
Speaker 2:  I'm not, I'm not in charge. No, I think it's, it's the, you can basically

830
00:50:25,405 --> 00:50:29,245
Speaker 2:  either do the, like a system like the analog pocket which is like an

831
00:50:29,245 --> 00:50:32,045
Speaker 2:  amazing piece of hardware but requires you to kind of bring your own games,

832
00:50:32,415 --> 00:50:36,085
Speaker 2:  which is the more legally upstanding thing as we've talked about in the show

833
00:50:36,085 --> 00:50:40,005
Speaker 2:  in the past, but also more expensive and more complicated. Or you

834
00:50:40,005 --> 00:50:43,725
Speaker 2:  can buy the things that you see all over Amazon from companies like Annick

835
00:50:43,725 --> 00:50:47,525
Speaker 2:  and Retro and others that are just the, we downloaded every

836
00:50:47,685 --> 00:50:50,285
Speaker 2:  rom we could find on the internet. Put it onto a device and we'll ship it

837
00:50:50,285 --> 00:50:54,165
Speaker 2:  to you from Amazon. Those are very fun. They come with some weirdness.

838
00:50:54,165 --> 00:50:56,685
Speaker 2:  Some of the games don't work, some might be games you don't like very much.

839
00:50:56,875 --> 00:51:00,765
Speaker 2:  They require some extra management but they work. The retro pocket is very

840
00:51:00,765 --> 00:51:04,525
Speaker 2:  good. It's the one people seem to like So I would steer you that way if

841
00:51:04,525 --> 00:51:08,405
Speaker 2:  that's what you want. But if you wanna like be a gaming purist, the

842
00:51:08,405 --> 00:51:12,325
Speaker 2:  Analog Pocket is is the one. Then we have a question that is another

843
00:51:12,325 --> 00:51:15,005
Speaker 2:  one we've gotten a bunch of, which is a voicemail from Hillary.

844
00:51:16,265 --> 00:51:19,805
Speaker 12:  Hey this is Hillary. My husband and I are

845
00:51:19,805 --> 00:51:23,565
Speaker 12:  expecting our second child in May and my husband

846
00:51:23,695 --> 00:51:27,525
Speaker 12:  wants to get a handheld gaming device to go with

847
00:51:27,525 --> 00:51:31,485
Speaker 12:  those long sleepless nights. I think it's a little bit silly too

848
00:51:31,485 --> 00:51:35,445
Speaker 12:  because he's not actually gonna have time to play it, but pretending that

849
00:51:35,445 --> 00:51:39,405
Speaker 12:  he does, he's trying to choose between a steam deck and an Nintendo

850
00:51:39,405 --> 00:51:43,285
Speaker 12:  Switch. Which would you recommend for using while caring

851
00:51:43,345 --> 00:51:44,965
Speaker 12:  for an infant? Thanks.

852
00:51:45,275 --> 00:51:48,045
Speaker 4:  Neither of them are very good as nannies. I would say

853
00:51:49,185 --> 00:51:53,085
Speaker 2:  So I. Think why I like this question is this is less what can I do

854
00:51:53,085 --> 00:51:56,245
Speaker 2:  for the child and more like how do I occupy myself while my child sleeps

855
00:51:56,245 --> 00:52:00,125
Speaker 2:  on top of, yeah, having just had an infant, I had

856
00:52:00,365 --> 00:52:04,245
Speaker 2:  terrible luck with this. I found that anytime I put a screen up

857
00:52:04,355 --> 00:52:08,285
Speaker 2:  sort of behind his head he would wake up and it would go sideways. But

858
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:12,165
Speaker 2:  I will say between these two the switch is, is the choice for me

859
00:52:12,185 --> 00:52:15,845
Speaker 2:  at least. Yeah, same. The games work super well

860
00:52:16,035 --> 00:52:20,005
Speaker 2:  offline. The thing is really simple and straightforward. You

861
00:52:20,005 --> 00:52:23,245
Speaker 2:  can put it on a table and just use the joycons in your hands or you can hold

862
00:52:23,245 --> 00:52:26,645
Speaker 2:  it or you can plug it in. It'll end up being a thing your kids can use when

863
00:52:26,645 --> 00:52:30,405
Speaker 2:  they go to like I just think it it, I lean way towards Switch

864
00:52:30,705 --> 00:52:34,525
Speaker 2:  as the more sort of, I have a kid on my lap and also

865
00:52:34,575 --> 00:52:37,005
Speaker 2:  wanna play video games kind of device.

866
00:52:37,685 --> 00:52:41,085
Speaker 6:  I totally agree and I think that the challenge with the Steam deck while

867
00:52:41,245 --> 00:52:45,125
Speaker 6:  a phenomenal gaming device is that you will spend a lot of time tinkering

868
00:52:45,125 --> 00:52:48,525
Speaker 6:  with it and if you do have limited amount of time to play

869
00:52:49,325 --> 00:52:53,245
Speaker 6:  because you are also caring for a new infant, the Switch is the one that

870
00:52:53,245 --> 00:52:56,365
Speaker 6:  you'll be able to just pick up, start playing, put it down when you need

871
00:52:56,365 --> 00:52:59,805
Speaker 6:  to and like, like David said, it is convertible to

872
00:52:59,965 --> 00:53:03,765
Speaker 6:  tabletop or TV playing very easily and stuff like that. So I would

873
00:53:03,965 --> 00:53:04,645
Speaker 6:  recommend the Switch as well.

874
00:53:04,945 --> 00:53:08,845
Speaker 4:  The best device for one-handed entertainment while you're caring for a

875
00:53:08,845 --> 00:53:11,645
Speaker 4:  child because generally you're only gonna have one hand is a Kindle.

876
00:53:12,885 --> 00:53:16,285
Speaker 4:  Oh yeah, just press the button and you can turn the page. Yep. It's the only

877
00:53:16,285 --> 00:53:17,925
Speaker 4:  one that you don't need two hands for.

878
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:22,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah, my gaming strategy was to get weirdly into this game called Hold

879
00:53:22,205 --> 00:53:25,765
Speaker 2:  Down on my phone, which is just a game where you

880
00:53:26,215 --> 00:53:30,005
Speaker 2:  shoot a ball at things and try to knock them down and get as far down as

881
00:53:30,005 --> 00:53:33,125
Speaker 2:  you possibly can. Have I ever spent six straight hours playing that game

882
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:36,765
Speaker 2:  while a child slept on top of me? Yes. I absolutely have So I truthfully

883
00:53:36,805 --> 00:53:40,005
Speaker 2:  I would say like an Apple Arcade subscription is like the the better

884
00:53:40,825 --> 00:53:44,805
Speaker 2:  infant care strategy than either of these devices. But yeah, I

885
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,685
Speaker 2:  would, I would lead a Nintendo Switch if that's where you're going. Alright,

886
00:53:47,785 --> 00:53:50,925
Speaker 2:  one more question and then we're getting outta here. This is a much broader

887
00:53:51,245 --> 00:53:54,525
Speaker 2:  question, So I, everybody has to answer. We can go any direction you want.

888
00:53:54,675 --> 00:53:58,245
Speaker 2:  It's an email from Charles. It says, I think niche, small batch hardware

889
00:53:58,245 --> 00:54:01,285
Speaker 2:  products make great gifts. Things like the panic play date, handheld console,

890
00:54:01,465 --> 00:54:05,325
Speaker 2:  the Dirty Wave M eight synth tracker or the paper shoot camera. The problem

891
00:54:05,445 --> 00:54:08,445
Speaker 2:  I run into is finding these products in the first place. Usually the marketing

892
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:11,085
Speaker 2:  relies on word of mouth referrals, so they're hard to find if you're not

893
00:54:11,085 --> 00:54:14,565
Speaker 2:  deep into the specific community or hobby these products are made for. I'm

894
00:54:14,565 --> 00:54:18,205
Speaker 2:  curious to know what your favorite small batch bespoke hardware is. I'm gonna

895
00:54:18,205 --> 00:54:22,005
Speaker 2:  broaden this question very slightly, which is just to say we each have to

896
00:54:22,245 --> 00:54:26,085
Speaker 2:  recommend one thing that is like thoroughly non-obvious. Something that you

897
00:54:26,085 --> 00:54:30,005
Speaker 2:  wouldn't find on like a gift guide that is like, here's

898
00:54:30,005 --> 00:54:33,845
Speaker 2:  the cool Bose headphones and AirPods and this iPhone and

899
00:54:33,845 --> 00:54:34,525
Speaker 2:  that laptop.

900
00:54:34,915 --> 00:54:38,325
Speaker 6:  I've got one and I will caveat that this might might appear on one of our

901
00:54:38,325 --> 00:54:42,285
Speaker 6:  gift guides 'cause our gift guides are very good and you know, I, I

902
00:54:42,485 --> 00:54:45,485
Speaker 6:  consider this a niche, small batch hardware. I'm not sure if Charles will

903
00:54:45,485 --> 00:54:49,365
Speaker 6:  agree, but I love the pine sill. It is a very cool

904
00:54:49,505 --> 00:54:53,405
Speaker 6:  little tool if you are into tinkering at all or if you want to

905
00:54:53,405 --> 00:54:57,205
Speaker 6:  like explore it. Like my personal experience, I've, I've never soldered anything

906
00:54:57,205 --> 00:55:01,085
Speaker 6:  before I bought a pine sill and now I'm soldering. Like that's like

907
00:55:01,225 --> 00:55:04,925
Speaker 6:  how it goes. And it was very easy to get into. It's very easy to use. It's

908
00:55:04,925 --> 00:55:08,165
Speaker 6:  very small and lightweight. It's inexpensive, it's a small company. Open

909
00:55:08,165 --> 00:55:10,405
Speaker 6:  source hardware. That would be my recommendation.

910
00:55:10,505 --> 00:55:13,205
Speaker 2:  That's a good one that counts. I'll give you that. V what do you got?

911
00:55:13,745 --> 00:55:17,445
Speaker 5:  One of the things I tested this year that is completely stupid but that I

912
00:55:17,445 --> 00:55:20,845
Speaker 5:  kind of enjoyed the concept of was the Now watch,

913
00:55:21,155 --> 00:55:24,925
Speaker 5:  okay, you're not gonna find this anywhere, but it is like a stress

914
00:55:25,035 --> 00:55:28,925
Speaker 5:  tracker device thing, but it has these little discs.

915
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:32,445
Speaker 5:  There's no display, it's one of these no display type trackers. It just,

916
00:55:32,545 --> 00:55:35,685
Speaker 5:  it just buzzes whenever you're stressed and it has these like

917
00:55:36,205 --> 00:55:40,045
Speaker 5:  gemstone faces that you take in and out with a little magnet

918
00:55:40,225 --> 00:55:44,165
Speaker 5:  and that thing was fun. I would not recommend it to most people to be

919
00:55:44,165 --> 00:55:48,045
Speaker 5:  clear who actually care about their health tracking. But for people who

920
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:51,805
Speaker 5:  are just like, I want something that's unique, I want

921
00:55:51,805 --> 00:55:55,525
Speaker 5:  something that's very stylish, I want something that's going to alert me

922
00:55:55,525 --> 00:55:58,925
Speaker 5:  when I'm really stressed out because I'm the type of person who caress and

923
00:55:58,925 --> 00:56:02,765
Speaker 5:  wants my tech to tell me to cool down. Then that one, it's

924
00:56:02,765 --> 00:56:06,525
Speaker 5:  weird and kind of fun. And then I thought of the other one that's really

925
00:56:06,525 --> 00:56:10,125
Speaker 5:  niche and something that I bought for myself this year is the

926
00:56:10,275 --> 00:56:10,765
Speaker 5:  Medi Cube

927
00:56:12,355 --> 00:56:16,325
Speaker 5:  booster h and it's a little wand that you zap your face with

928
00:56:16,745 --> 00:56:20,565
Speaker 5:  so that your skincare goes into your skin more deeply. It

929
00:56:20,635 --> 00:56:23,645
Speaker 5:  uses electroporation, it's all over TikTok,

930
00:56:24,505 --> 00:56:27,405
Speaker 5:  but if you're not in the skincare community you ain't gonna know about this

931
00:56:27,405 --> 00:56:31,285
Speaker 5:  thing. So there you go. That's good. The Mecu Booster H

932
00:56:31,355 --> 00:56:35,285
Speaker 5:  it's on sale for like 50% these days. So I would do it. Hailey

933
00:56:35,485 --> 00:56:36,685
Speaker 5:  Bieber uses it. So there you go.

934
00:56:37,405 --> 00:56:38,405
Speaker 2:  All, right? Chen you got one.

935
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:42,685
Speaker 4:  Well, I'm not sure it quite fits with the niche small batch

936
00:56:42,965 --> 00:56:45,965
Speaker 4:  hardware but Maybe it does. But Home Assistant,

937
00:56:47,105 --> 00:56:50,925
Speaker 4:  the Home assistant Green if you wanna, you know, be Budget,

938
00:56:51,015 --> 00:56:54,965
Speaker 4:  which is their, their new budget version of getting started with

939
00:56:54,965 --> 00:56:58,405
Speaker 4:  Home Assistant. But as we started the smart home discussion with

940
00:56:58,825 --> 00:57:02,085
Speaker 4:  all the problems with Matter and how you should buy a device that also works

941
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:05,765
Speaker 4:  with other platforms, home assistant would be your friend here because

942
00:57:05,985 --> 00:57:09,965
Speaker 4:  it can help you get any device into any platform and also will

943
00:57:09,965 --> 00:57:13,805
Speaker 4:  offer matter support going forward. It has matter support in beta

944
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:17,565
Speaker 4:  right now as everyone else does. Everyone's in beta right now,

945
00:57:18,625 --> 00:57:22,165
Speaker 4:  so yeah, it's, it's a, every time I write a review on The Verge,

946
00:57:22,545 --> 00:57:26,285
Speaker 4:  one of the comments will be, but you can already do this with Home Assistant.

947
00:57:26,835 --> 00:57:30,685
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it is, it is a great powerful tool. It

948
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:34,845
Speaker 4:  it's one of those devices that if you give to a friend you are going to then

949
00:57:34,845 --> 00:57:37,765
Speaker 4:  become their backup IT person,

950
00:57:39,105 --> 00:57:42,285
Speaker 4:  but you will know the right friend to give this to and if you give it to

951
00:57:42,285 --> 00:57:45,125
Speaker 4:  the right friend they will be very, very grateful.

952
00:57:45,445 --> 00:57:49,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah, the, the home assistant people are a little like the Linux people but

953
00:57:49,075 --> 00:57:52,605
Speaker 2:  Home Assistant is much more of a product that regular people can actually

954
00:57:52,605 --> 00:57:53,605
Speaker 2:  figure out and

955
00:57:53,605 --> 00:57:56,605
Speaker 4:  It's gotten that way a lot over this last year or two. Yeah, they've really

956
00:57:56,665 --> 00:58:00,165
Speaker 4:  put a lot into making this a lot a much easier proposition than,

957
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:01,325
Speaker 4:  than it once was.

958
00:58:01,965 --> 00:58:05,805
Speaker 2:  I, I agree. Mine I have two. One is a gadget

959
00:58:05,805 --> 00:58:08,845
Speaker 2:  and one is not, but it's close enough. One is the one I've already mentioned,

960
00:58:08,845 --> 00:58:11,725
Speaker 2:  which is the Analog pocket, which I think as like a little

961
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:16,365
Speaker 2:  Game boy thing for the modern age is just one of the like best made

962
00:58:16,365 --> 00:58:19,205
Speaker 2:  pieces of hardware out there. It's the kind of thing that like if you're

963
00:58:19,205 --> 00:58:22,085
Speaker 2:  in the gaming world, you know this and you're like, David, the analog pocket

964
00:58:22,085 --> 00:58:25,165
Speaker 2:  doesn't count in this game, but if you're not, you've probably never heard

965
00:58:25,165 --> 00:58:28,645
Speaker 2:  of it. It takes cartridges. It's a very fun thing. If you wanna like play

966
00:58:28,645 --> 00:58:32,085
Speaker 2:  retro games in a new way, it, it rules and they're also building a thing

967
00:58:32,085 --> 00:58:35,605
Speaker 2:  for the N 64 that is not coming out this year, but it is probably coming

968
00:58:35,605 --> 00:58:39,005
Speaker 2:  out next year and I'm confident I'm going to do whatever it takes to buy

969
00:58:39,005 --> 00:58:42,285
Speaker 2:  one whenever that happens. So if you wanna just like wrap up a piece of paper

970
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:46,165
Speaker 2:  that says I'll buy you the N 64 thing, that works fine. The other one

971
00:58:46,185 --> 00:58:50,165
Speaker 2:  is I've gotten back into a kick with notebooks as

972
00:58:50,225 --> 00:58:53,885
Speaker 2:  Dan can attest, I spend all of my time switching between to-do list apps

973
00:58:54,325 --> 00:58:57,885
Speaker 2:  and recently I have given up on to-do list apps and I'm back to writing

974
00:58:58,345 --> 00:59:02,085
Speaker 2:  on paper like a, like our ancestors did and the

975
00:59:02,515 --> 00:59:06,085
Speaker 2:  team from Cortex, which makes very good podcasts over Relay fm, they made

976
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:09,525
Speaker 2:  a thing called the Sidekick ePad that is this big wide

977
00:59:09,925 --> 00:59:13,165
Speaker 2:  notebook that is part like lists on the right and just sort of empty space

978
00:59:13,165 --> 00:59:17,005
Speaker 2:  to right on the left and it sits on your desk and is a perfect like day

979
00:59:17,005 --> 00:59:19,365
Speaker 2:  planner thing and I love it very much. It's a

980
00:59:19,365 --> 00:59:23,045
Speaker 6:  Great wrist rest for your keyboard too. It's like, it's specifically designed

981
00:59:23,045 --> 00:59:24,645
Speaker 6:  to be the width of your keyboard, which is very

982
00:59:24,645 --> 00:59:27,445
Speaker 2:  Cool. Yeah and it sort of sits in front of it and you can like write on it

983
00:59:27,445 --> 00:59:30,405
Speaker 2:  and then go back to typing. It's, it's lovely and I have enjoyed it very

984
00:59:30,405 --> 00:59:34,365
Speaker 2:  much so that's my recommendation. Alright, thank you all. We should

985
00:59:34,365 --> 00:59:37,765
Speaker 2:  get outta here. I hope we have spent a lot of people's money and if you wanna

986
00:59:37,765 --> 00:59:41,485
Speaker 2:  buy us nice things to, to tell us, send Jen

987
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:44,525
Speaker 2:  all of your matter compatible gadgets and she will somehow figure out how

988
00:59:44,525 --> 00:59:48,445
Speaker 2:  to install them in her home All. right. Thank you guys. Appreciate

989
