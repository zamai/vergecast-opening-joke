00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,280
Speaker 2:  Welcome to the Vergecast the flagship podcast of Sarah fonts. I'm your

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,160
Speaker 2:  friend, David Pierce. And it is currently 5 51 in the morning on

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,000
Speaker 2:  Tuesday, September 13th, which means that a, I have to be quiet cuz

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,760
Speaker 2:  no one else is awake yet. And B it means we're about nine

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,120
Speaker 2:  minutes away from the launch of the new verge.com. We've been working on

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,040
Speaker 2:  this for two years. It's a redesign. We have a new logo. It's

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,720
Speaker 2:  a totally new way of thinking about how the verge actually works.

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,240
Speaker 2:  And so that's actually what this episode is gonna be about. We spent two

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,960
Speaker 2:  years on this, like I said, and it made us think some pretty philosophical

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,960
Speaker 2:  thoughts about how the internet works and how platforms work and

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,880
Speaker 2:  what it means to just be a person on the internet. Now I will

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,320
Speaker 2:  warn you. This episode is very Naval gazey. We talk a lot about the verge

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,960
Speaker 2:  and a lot about our feelings about the verge, but I think it's really interesting

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,200
Speaker 2:  and it was cool to go through the same kind of stuff that a lot of the companies

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,200
Speaker 2:  we cover are going through all the time. So we're gonna get to all of that

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,160
Speaker 2:  in just a second, but first I'm gonna go refresh our website about 300 times.

18
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,080
Speaker 2:  Cause I can't wait to see it. See, in a sec,

19
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,740
Speaker 2:  Renting a car can be an expensive hassle, but it doesn't have to be

20
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,660
Speaker 2:  TRO is the world's largest car sharing marketplace. They have a wide

21
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,340
Speaker 2:  selection of vehicles ready for you to browse available across the UK,

22
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,180
Speaker 2:  Canada and the us perfect for a variety of budgets

23
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,900
Speaker 2:  and needs. And many, two row hosts can even deliver your car

24
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,620
Speaker 2:  right to your location, whether your road tripping or your everyday car is

25
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,060
Speaker 2:  just out of commission. Every two road trip is backed by liability insurance

26
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:39,100
Speaker 2:  term conditions and exclusions apply ditch boring rental cars and find your

27
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,540

Speaker 4:  With no fees or minimums banking with capital. One is the easiest decision

29
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,300
Speaker 4:  in the history of decisions. Even easier than deciding to listen to another

30
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,140
Speaker 4:  episode of your favorite podcast with no overdraft fees is an

31
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,020
Speaker 4:  even a decision that's banking reimagine what's in your wallet terms

Speaker 4:  F D I C.

34
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,290
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. So before we get into the show, just a quick

35
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,930
Speaker 2:  heads up next week, we're gonna be answering all of your questions about

36
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,370
Speaker 2:  Apple's new stuff, all the new phones, new watches, new software,

37
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,890
Speaker 2:  anything you wanna know, all you have to do is call in to the verge hotline,

38
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,770
Speaker 2:  which is 8 66 verge one one, and ask us any of

39
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,170
Speaker 2:  your most burning questions, the weirder, the better, and we will do as many

40
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,090
Speaker 2:  as we can on the show next week. Okay, let's get into it.

41
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,570
Speaker 2:  As I mentioned today, we're gonna focus on websites, mostly one

42
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:41,370
Speaker 2:  that we made and have spent the last two years, making the new verge, just

43
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,210
Speaker 2:  launched it's new and exciting. And in the process of launching

44
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:49,170
Speaker 2:  this, I learned a surprising amount about how web CAEs work turns out.

45
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,650
Speaker 2:  They're very complicated. I just came back to the verge in April when the

46
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,530
Speaker 2:  new website was already deep in progress. So I wanted to know where

47
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,400
Speaker 2:  it started, where it came from and why it felt like this

48
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,200
Speaker 2:  was the future of the verge. So I grabbed who else? NEI Patel

49
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,960
Speaker 2:  to talk about it. He's been thinking about this forever. He's been literally

50
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,760
Speaker 2:  like running around V media, talking about revolutionizing the media

51
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,440
Speaker 2:  with blog posts and over the course of his career and the verge

52
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,360
Speaker 2:  we've seen the future of the internet seem like it's changed a hundred

53
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,280
Speaker 2:  times. So we have a lot to talk about here, especially as we look at the

54
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,680
Speaker 2:  next decade, let's get into it.

55
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,840
Speaker 2:  Eli. Hello?

56
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,000
Speaker 6:  Hey man, how's it going?

57
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,000
Speaker 2:  We have a new website.

58
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,680
Speaker 6:  We have a new website. It is two years in the making. I could not be more

59
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,200
Speaker 6:  excited about it.

60
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,960
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So I wanna talk about like what it is and all the implications and

61
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,320
Speaker 2:  the like taglines you've been using obsessively for like as long as I've

62
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,720
Speaker 2:  been here, but this redesign predates me. So I think like I wanna know the

63
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,160
Speaker 2:  story and I think people will too, cuz it's an interesting story. Like start

64
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,480
Speaker 2:  at the beginning. How do we decide to redesign the verge.com? Well,

65
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,160
Speaker 6:  First I just wanna point out that I recruited you back to the verge by showing

66
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,800
Speaker 6:  you the redesign and you quit your job the next day and came to work

67
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,760
Speaker 2:  Here. That is precisely correct. Yes.

68
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,320
Speaker 6:  Which is very good. And that's how I knew it was gonna work. So the redesign

69
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,240
Speaker 6:  it's very simple. Actually our last redesign was six

70
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,120
Speaker 6:  years ago, five years ago. And we did that redesign for

71
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,480
Speaker 6:  what we thought was the era of what you might call distributed publishing

72
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,120
Speaker 6:  Google amp and Facebook instant articles. So we tried to make this thing

73
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,520
Speaker 6:  that could travel everywhere and we put a lot of our emphasis

74
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,120
Speaker 6:  into elements that would say the verge or feel like the verge, no matter

75
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,760
Speaker 6:  where they were. So that's where you got like bright pink pull

76
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,040
Speaker 6:  quotes. That's where you got a lot of our photo styles.

77
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,400
Speaker 2:  So you're saying like, how do we let people share screenshots or videos?

78
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,520
Speaker 2:  And like, have it still be the verge? Like how do we look like the verge

79
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,280
Speaker 2:  even when you're not on the verse.com?

80
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,200
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And I think that was really the prevailing wisdom in media

81
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:44,760
Speaker 6:  back

82
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,160
Speaker 2:  Then websites were dying, that

83
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,200
Speaker 6:  Websites were dying and that Facebook, instant articles take over the media.

84
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,320
Speaker 6:  There was a lot of writing about it, which I won't go into, but there was

85
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,800
Speaker 6:  just a, that was the conventional wisdom of the industry was that the platforms

86
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,480
Speaker 6:  would suck all media into them and we would never open safari

87
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,280
Speaker 6:  again. And we would just read everything in apple news. And to some

88
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,600
Speaker 6:  extent that happened, like it really happened to a lot of publishers.

89
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,880
Speaker 6:  I just think that era is kind of over in one way. If you just look at our

90
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,880
Speaker 6:  traffic, like Facebook, instant articles doesn't exist anymore. Apple news

91
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,720
Speaker 6:  is big, but like we can't feel it. A lot of our stories like hit huge

92
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,240
Speaker 6:  in apple news, but we just like, don't see it. We don't feel it. Like we

93
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,320
Speaker 6:  don't have a community there.

94
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,800
Speaker 2:  I think of apple news as like the print newspaper of 2022 where it's like,

95
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,560
Speaker 2:  I know it's there and I know people consume it. I just don't know

96
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,680
Speaker 2:  anything about what happens there. It's just like a magical other place where

97
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,400
Speaker 2:  people read news.

98
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:38,160
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And I think the most important piece is there's no feedback loop from

99
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,520
Speaker 6:  that platform in particular people read it. They can't talk to you.

100
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,200
Speaker 6:  And then you just look at the other broader trends, where do people talk

101
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,240
Speaker 6:  to us? Like I think the verge has, is a really important part of the verge.

102
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,720
Speaker 6:  It's what we started with. Yeah. I think old time listeners will, will know

103
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,560
Speaker 6:  this. We started the whole site with a podcast was

104
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,280
Speaker 6:  called, this is my next podcast. Cuz we had left in gadget. We, we needed

105
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,880
Speaker 6:  a new podcast and that was the name. Then the site was called, this is my

106
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,400
Speaker 6:  next. And then the first thing to launch with the verge was the Vergecast.

107
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,640
Speaker 6:  So we knew that our success was built on a community of

108
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,840
Speaker 6:  our, our readers and our listeners. And I just was

109
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:14,040
Speaker 6:  thinking really hard. Like how do I get that back instead of

110
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,800
Speaker 6:  giving it to Twitter or giving it to YouTube or giving it

111
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Speaker 6:  to Reddit or Twitch or discord, all the other things people are doing, which

112
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,560
Speaker 6:  are smart and good, but we happen to have a gigantic website.

113
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,960
Speaker 6:  So we should probably build on our own platform in some way.

114
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,680
Speaker 2:  One of the things I think is really interesting about this moment of time

115
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,960
Speaker 2:  that we're in is like a lot of people are looking at that exact same thing

116
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,600
Speaker 2:  you just described and saying, oh, the thing I need to do is lean deeper

117
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,680
Speaker 2:  into those platforms to say like, this is where this is happening. Like,

118
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,800
Speaker 2:  what I actually need to do is start a discord and try to get people in there

119
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,680
Speaker 2:  or like become a editor. Like you see the, the Washington post strategy is

120
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,840
Speaker 2:  like, how do we build full communities in all of these places? Right. And

121
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,000
Speaker 2:  I think it's very interesting to me that you and the team looked at this

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,880
Speaker 2:  and said like, okay, how do we pull some of this back towards us rather than

123
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,000
Speaker 2:  falling into those holes again, for

124
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,840
Speaker 6:  Sure. And I, I think those strategies are actually smart. It's not that we're

125
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,600
Speaker 6:  not gonna do it. You know, we've started publishing this show as a series

126
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,720
Speaker 6:  of talks, right? Like we know that there's audience on those platforms, you

127
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,280
Speaker 6:  have to go to those audiences. I just think the big move

128
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,760
Speaker 6:  is where are you gonna bring those audiences back to? Where are they gonna

129
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,560
Speaker 6:  find you first? And I, we have an asset at the verge that we really

130
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,040
Speaker 6:  haven't taken advantage of in some time, which is our homepage. Our homepage,

131
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,760
Speaker 6:  right, is the single most popular page at V media. The most popular

132
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,640
Speaker 6:  webpage at Vox media on any given day is the verge homepage. So a lot

133
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,520
Speaker 6:  of this was how do I make that page really, really valuable for more people.

134
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,480
Speaker 6:  And then what we coupled that with was de and I were

135
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,400
Speaker 6:  routinely frustrated that we weren't on our own homepage enough. We

136
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,240
Speaker 6:  were both busy. We were running the site, we were making podcasts,

137
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,000
Speaker 6:  we were off shooting videos. And so when the barrier to

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,400
Speaker 6:  entry to our own homepage was a 500 word article

139
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,240
Speaker 6:  about something we had seen. It was too high. Like we weren't publishing

140
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,400
Speaker 6:  enough and we were driving ourselves crazy. And we found ourselves using

141
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,160
Speaker 6:  Twitter, which is someone else's platform. Yep. And a good platform. Lots

142
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,920
Speaker 6:  of people use Twitter. They build great communities around themselves. But

143
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,640
Speaker 6:  if you look at what they tend to do with those communities, they convert

144
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,400
Speaker 6:  them to something else that makes them money. And we were like not doing

145
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,200
Speaker 6:  a great job with that.

146
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,720
Speaker 2:  Or they just let them languish and nothing ever happens to them is generally

147
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,360
Speaker 2:  Twitter's move.

148
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:20,280
Speaker 6:  Yeah. You know, I think a lot of the sub stack writers, right. Their

149
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,120
Speaker 6:  audiences on Twitter and they convert them into paying subst customers. I

150
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,280
Speaker 6:  think that's great. I have no beef with that whatsoever. I just, I'm looking

151
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,680
Speaker 6:  at the gigantic website we run and saying, why am I finding it easier to

152
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,560
Speaker 6:  publish on someone else's platform instead of my own, I'm the boss,

153
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,840
Speaker 6:  that's a weird outcome. Right. But then it's like, you get into

154
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,800
Speaker 6:  what, what a 500 word article or a thousand word article or 10,000

155
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,640
Speaker 6:  word review means to people and you have to deliver the quality

156
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,520
Speaker 6:  bar. So if I was like, I'm just excusing myself from the

157
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,160
Speaker 6:  publishing process or our standards or whatever. So I can just yellow

158
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,040
Speaker 6:  out things that look like tweets in our, our article page one. I think that

159
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,640
Speaker 6:  staff would mute me. I think I would very quickly stop being the boss. I

160
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,880
Speaker 6:  think that's just the end of that. And two, I think we would do disservice

161
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,640
Speaker 6:  to our audience, right? We would, right. We would be sending them the signal

162
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:10,120
Speaker 6:  of what a product looked like a journalism product looked like, but then

163
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,640
Speaker 6:  not actually over delivering on the product, which is what you wanna do.

164
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,480
Speaker 6:  So we just started having the deed and I were talking to this for a long

165
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,360
Speaker 6:  time and we came up with a phrase which actually I think is too

166
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,720
Speaker 6:  reductive for what our new site is, but we just wanna be able to tweet onto

167
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,040
Speaker 6:  our own website. Right. That was like the first thing we said to our designers

168
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,120
Speaker 6:  and what had happened was Vox media had just merged with New York magazine.

169
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:34,080
Speaker 6:  So we got all these new designers onto our design team that were the

170
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,400
Speaker 6:  great New York magazine designers. And so we had our existing great design

171
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,040
Speaker 6:  team that we loved. We had these new New York mag designers and we just got

172
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,760
Speaker 6:  to think from a clean sheet, what unearth does tweet

173
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,480
Speaker 6:  onto the website mean? And our first prototype dealer. And I made it

174
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:51,400
Speaker 6:  in the same life blog tool that we use for apple events. Right. We just

175
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,120
Speaker 6:  were like, we're not gonna think about our technology product. We're just

176
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,640
Speaker 6:  gonna blog the news for ourselves for a day and just see what it feels like.

177
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,600
Speaker 6:  Even that was too much. So we made another prototype in Google docs.

178
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,280
Speaker 6:  So we weren't thinking about other people's software at all. And we were

179
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,200
Speaker 6:  just kind of like figuring it out. And we gave those prototypes over and

180
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,360
Speaker 6:  we ended up with our site where we kind of solved a bunch of problems at

181
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,280
Speaker 6:  once. Like how do most people experience the news in a

182
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,880
Speaker 6:  newsfeed? So our site should just look like a newsfeed.

183
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,760
Speaker 6:  How do we make it easier for our reporters to talk to the audience? Well,

184
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,400
Speaker 6:  you give them the tool they're already used to using to do that, which is

185
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,920
Speaker 6:  something that looks like posting to a newsfeed, like a Twitter or our Facebook.

186
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,760
Speaker 6:  And then how do you, re-promote our own stories without just doing the boring

187
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,640
Speaker 6:  thing that we do now, which is like pin them to the top. You let us write

188
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,360
Speaker 6:  about them like human beings. And then you get to, we turn the next

189
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,560
Speaker 6:  corner, which was, oh, we should be able to embed anything from anywhere.

190
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,520
Speaker 6:  So there's a cool TikTok. We don't have to write a whole article about it.

191
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,600
Speaker 6:  We can literally just say, here's our cool TikTok. It turns out our video

192
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,560
Speaker 6:  team makes a lot of cool talks and they had no access to our own homepage.

193
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,120
Speaker 6:  So now our video team has access to our homepage in something that looks

194
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,840
Speaker 6:  exactly a good news feed. It's familiar. We don't have to like teach anybody

195
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,720
Speaker 6:  how to use it and you just keep stacking it up. And then you get to

196
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,640
Speaker 6:  me saying, I'm gonna revolutionize the media with blog post, which I think

197
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,120
Speaker 6:  we're gonna do.

198
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,280
Speaker 2:  Part of me has wondered through this whole process. If the thing that we're

199
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,240
Speaker 2:  doing is just reinventing the internet circa like 2004

200
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,600
Speaker 2:  back when everybody's theory was like, I'm gonna have my own

201
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,720
Speaker 2:  site and we're, I'm gonna have a blog role and we're all gonna come to each

202
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,280
Speaker 2:  other's websites. And you know, you're gonna sit on my homepage and refresh

203
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,760
Speaker 2:  it a hundred times a day. And there's like a, there's a subset of people

204
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,560
Speaker 2:  who I think like really missed those days. And that was like when RSS readers

205
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,240
Speaker 2:  were big and that was great. And then there's a subset of people who are

206
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,280
Speaker 2:  like, you know, actually Twitter and Facebook are like pretty successful

207
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,560
Speaker 2:  platforms at showing me stuff that I'm interested in and care about.

208
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,840
Speaker 2:  And I think, I don't know, I'm, I'm torn between those two worlds. Like I

209
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,680
Speaker 2:  got started in this world at like the middle of that transition

210
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,080
Speaker 2:  between like the blogging world and the like digital news

211
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,120
Speaker 2:  world. I don't know. Is it like, is this just you wishing it was, was

212
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,040
Speaker 2:  2005 again and you were just like writing a million posts a day.

213
00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:00,200
Speaker 6:  A little bit. Okay. I can't, I can't say no. You know,

214
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,280
Speaker 6:  I got my start in all this when I was sitting in law school and I would refresh

215
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,240
Speaker 6:  the end gadget homepage a hundred times a day. And then I quickly realized

216
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,080
Speaker 6:  like I should get an RS reader. And then I would refresh the RS reader a

217
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,480
Speaker 6:  hundred times a day. And I remember my friends and I used to say,

218
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,480
Speaker 6:  we've run out of the internet. We have to like start paying attention in

219
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,920
Speaker 6:  class because we, we had like read all the blog posts that day. Right.

220
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,200
Speaker 6:  And that feeling was actually like, fine, like looking back on it, that feeling

221
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,600
Speaker 6:  was fine. And now we live in this like world of infinity. Right. And I, I

222
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,000
Speaker 6:  think a lot of people would like the internet to come to an end every day.

223
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:31,840
Speaker 6:  So yeah, there's a part of it. That's just what I want to feel like

224
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:36,000
Speaker 6:  is that our site is a conversation that's ongoing and you can come join

225
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,600
Speaker 6:  it. And it does not have the toxicity of a Twitter

226
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:43,680
Speaker 6:  associated with it. It does not have the chaos of a Facebook

227
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,640
Speaker 6:  newsfeed associated with it. It's where we are. And just like, I,

228
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,480
Speaker 6:  I think the Vergecast audience feels about our show. Our site should feel

229
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,280
Speaker 6:  like you're hanging out with us. It just so happens that we

230
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,560
Speaker 6:  are really excellent journalists who are smart and know, know what we're

231
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,200
Speaker 6:  talking about, but like what, the way it should feel is that it's a

232
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,920
Speaker 6:  community. Right. And that, that I think is missing from so many places on

233
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,280
Speaker 6:  the internet.

234
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,120
Speaker 2:  I think that's right. And I think the thing to me that really jumped out,

235
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,360
Speaker 2:  like when you first showed me, I think it was just a bunch of like Figma

236
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,800
Speaker 2:  pages that you were just like, look, here's, here's some things it was like

237
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:20,000
Speaker 2:  to me, the internet is so uncurated now in really crappy

238
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,440
Speaker 2:  unpleasant ways where like I go, I was thinking about this the other day,

239
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,600
Speaker 2:  like when you have five minutes to kill, where do you go? Right. And I like,

240
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,520
Speaker 2:  I go to Twitter and it makes me angry or I go to TikTok and then it's been

241
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,840
Speaker 2:  like 50 minutes and I'm still in the bathroom and that's awkward. And then

242
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,680
Speaker 2:  I say, that's not any good, like Instagram is just the same thing.

243
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,840
Speaker 2:  Now, YouTube, all the videos are too long. I don't know. So it's like, there

244
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,440
Speaker 2:  just, isn't like a, a place to go and find stuff that I'm interested

245
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,440
Speaker 2:  in. And even news websites, like there's tons of them. Lots of them are very

246
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,360
Speaker 2:  good, but they all just like have their own stuff and pretends like the rest

247
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,600
Speaker 2:  of the world doesn't exist. And one thing I've always liked about the verge

248
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:55,000
Speaker 2:  is that it like acknowledges that the internet is a large place full of people

249
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,520
Speaker 2:  who don't work at the verge and that sometimes they do interesting things

250
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,400
Speaker 2:  and that's all well and good. But I feel like the cool thing about the thing

251
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,040
Speaker 2:  that we're trying to do is like, we're just gonna tell you about all the

252
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,920
Speaker 2:  stuff you should know about and not in like a businessy sound

253
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,800
Speaker 2:  smart in your first meeting way, but like a, the, Internet's like a

254
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,120
Speaker 2:  cool, interesting place and we're good at finding it cause we do it for a

255
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,080
Speaker 2:  living. And there's just not a lot of that. Like I used to spend a lot of

256
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,000
Speaker 2:  time on long form and like old dig and Reddit is still very good at

257
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,360
Speaker 2:  this, but there's just like, not that many places where I'm just like, I

258
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,960
Speaker 2:  have five minutes to kill, show me some cool stuff from people I like and

259
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,840
Speaker 2:  trust. And that's like, I wish more of the internet felt like that.

260
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,480
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And I, I do think there's an element of that. That was that old

261
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,440
Speaker 6:  blogging experience. Yeah. I'll give great credit to our friend, John Gruber,

262
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,200
Speaker 6:  daring fireball during fireball, is that still he's built an entire

263
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,880
Speaker 6:  career doing that. Certainly there's some inspiration from that in our site.

264
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,040
Speaker 6:  But I think there's also just another turn of it, which is you've gotta,

265
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,600
Speaker 6:  gotta actually reconceptualize that into the product that people are familiar

266
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,200
Speaker 6:  with, which is a newsfeed. There's a little bit of the old blog ideas in

267
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,960
Speaker 6:  there, but we didn't inherit all of them. Right. This isn't in gadget from

268
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,880
Speaker 6:  2006 or whatever, where we used to say like read more after the jump,

269
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,800
Speaker 6:  like there's a whole set of moves. We could glue back

270
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,720
Speaker 6:  onto this product. But really I think the audience

271
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,560
Speaker 6:  now is just like used to newsfeed. So we actually made it more like a newsfeed

272
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,480
Speaker 6:  and more like, Hey, we're just pointing you at other stuff instead of,

273
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,360
Speaker 6:  Hey, there's more here. And one of my biggest goals, like one of our, the

274
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,240
Speaker 6:  big number that I'm looking at is how much traffic we send out. I

275
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,440
Speaker 6:  think we will be a huge success if we are sending a meaningful amount of

276
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,160
Speaker 6:  traffic to other people, right. And they can see it and we can see it cuz

277
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,040
Speaker 6:  that relationship between publishers and platforms has

278
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,920
Speaker 6:  gotten totally outta whack. Most publishers get their traffic from Google

279
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,880
Speaker 6:  and their newsrooms are paying attention to Twitter, which actually sends

280
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,160
Speaker 6:  nobody any traffic. We can very quickly send a lot of people more traffic

281
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,040
Speaker 6:  than Twitter. I think. So if we can just get back in the game where we're

282
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,800
Speaker 6:  like, Hey, you can build your own communities on your own

283
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,760
Speaker 6:  platforms. Once again, in a format that feels both very modern

284
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,560
Speaker 6:  because it's a newsfeed, but inherits the best parts of what people

285
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,000
Speaker 6:  loved about blogging. And you're like a good citizen of the internet

286
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,960
Speaker 6:  because you're sharing the wealth. I think that let lets you

287
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,800
Speaker 6:  kind of reset that whole relationship a little bit and then potentially build

288
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,040
Speaker 6:  whatever the next things are without constantly scrambling against whatever

289
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,880
Speaker 6:  algorithm update, whatever platform is gonna roll out to up or down

290
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,760
Speaker 6:  rank, whatever content.

291
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:27,280
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Well, okay. So I wanna come back to Google because you have mad spicy

292
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,720
Speaker 2:  takes about Google that we're gonna get to in a second. But I think the,

293
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,600
Speaker 2:  the community aspect of this is I suspect gonna be a thing. A lot

294
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,720
Speaker 2:  of people like press against and try to figure out, especially cuz like the

295
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,560
Speaker 2:  first version of the feed that we have, doesn't have comments

296
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,160
Speaker 2:  and it's, it's a thing I know you've been thinking about for a long time

297
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,680
Speaker 2:  and like, are we gonna have like retweets, but they're called like

298
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:50,440
Speaker 2:  refuges and something happens there and you can like super verge

299
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,120
Speaker 2:  something for 9 99 a month. And like, I don't know, do we end up like

300
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,720
Speaker 2:  algorithmically personalizing these newsfeed, right? There's just like, when

301
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,080
Speaker 2:  you call something a newsfeed, there's this like long road you can trip down

302
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,040
Speaker 2:  into good, but also like deeply weird stuff. And then like

303
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,280
Speaker 2:  three years from now, the verge is just like vertical scrolling video on

304
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,160
Speaker 2:  the homepage. And that's all that we are. This is how it goes. Like we've

305
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,480
Speaker 2:  seen this over and over and over again,

306
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,120
Speaker 6:  Here are all of David Spears. I would like to get to the point where the

307
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,720
Speaker 6:  verge is responsible for the outcome of American democracy. I think we'd

308
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,960
Speaker 6:  be excellent stewards of it. Just to be honest, like we, if we have a goal,

309
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,320
Speaker 6:  that's

310
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,920
Speaker 2:  It I'll take that on. I'm ready for it.

311
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,120
Speaker 6:  You know, I don't know what we're gonna do next. The reason we don't, we,

312
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,960
Speaker 6:  we want to have comments. The reason we don't have comments now is because

313
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,600
Speaker 6:  we are very good at covering platforms and content moderation and we should

314
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,480
Speaker 6:  have a plan for how to grow a healthy community. Before we just light up

315
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,840
Speaker 6:  comments on a hundred more posts today,

316
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,920
Speaker 2:  We've written the like, what if they had thought about this ahead of time,

317
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,000
Speaker 2:  story enough that we should probably think about it ahead of time.

318
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,720
Speaker 6:  Right? And I, I wanna flip it on and see if it works. I want, you know, I

319
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,440
Speaker 6:  I think think the best place to be is for other people to

320
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,280
Speaker 6:  tell us what things they think are obvious, right? Here's this product.

321
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,640
Speaker 6:  And here's what we think is the obvious next step for you. And then you deliver

322
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,840
Speaker 6:  the thing that's obvious to a lot of people that makes them happy. Right?

323
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,000
Speaker 6:  And like, I think there's a relationship with our community there where we

324
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,480
Speaker 6:  want to build that thing together. Just like I, again, I think there's a,

325
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,760
Speaker 6:  the success of the verge in one tiny way

326
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,120
Speaker 6:  is that the verge cast audience is a community, right? And that

327
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,720
Speaker 6:  community for better or worse wants us to take

328
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,680
Speaker 6:  interesting shots at how to cover tech. And so we can take some risks that

329
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,520
Speaker 6:  maybe a more traditional brand, like the times or whatever we can't

330
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,920
Speaker 6:  take. I think we can do that with our website too. I just want, I just wanna

331
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,880
Speaker 6:  make sure that, you know, we have enough moderators or they're sufficiently

332
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,080
Speaker 6:  prepared for the influx of new content or we have a new commenting

333
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,800
Speaker 6:  platform it's called coral, which is very cool. It's part of the V media,

334
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,200
Speaker 6:  but it's powers comments on all kinds of sites all over the world. I wanna

335
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,600
Speaker 6:  make sure people are initiated into coral the correct way. And they're they

336
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,840
Speaker 6:  know how to use the tool and it feels empowering. I can see us getting to

337
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,600
Speaker 6:  a place where in our newsfeed, we might have top commenters.

338
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:01,440
Speaker 6:  We might be able to promote comments into the newsfeed and say, here's a

339
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,280
Speaker 6:  great comment from a story. You can see all the things we might be able to

340
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,040
Speaker 6:  do. I think we just have to be very judicious at how we

341
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,720
Speaker 6:  grow that and how we do it step by step. Because if we get it wrong,

342
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:15,520
Speaker 6:  like we know what happens. Like we're really good at covering that story.

343
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,600
Speaker 2:  Well, and I think to me, honestly, the comment side of this is one of the

344
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,040
Speaker 2:  things that's gonna be most interesting to watch because like again, to,

345
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,720
Speaker 2:  you know, rewind a generation of internet media, don't read the comments

346
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,600
Speaker 2:  just became like a truism of anyone who writes online, right? Like the comments

347
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,440
Speaker 2:  was either a thing you got rid of, or just like a cesspool where people

348
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,400
Speaker 2:  were horrible that you were trained to ignore and that no good came of reading

349
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,920
Speaker 2:  the comments. And then eventually everybody sort of outsourced the comments

350
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,920
Speaker 2:  to Twitter and that has its own messy problems.

351
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,240
Speaker 6:  And then they all got addicted to reading Twitter. Right? It's like, it's

352
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,440
Speaker 6:  a weird cycle that happened there. So

353
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,000
Speaker 2:  I guess like the, the thing that I'm curious about is to see like the,

354
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,320
Speaker 2:  obviously the content moderation thing is crucial. And as we've seen over

355
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,960
Speaker 2:  and over anyone who does that at any size beyond like six people, it's a

356
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,720
Speaker 2:  lot of work and it's hard to get. Right. But can we start to solve some of

357
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,560
Speaker 2:  this stuff with product, like as a person on the internet? I think it's fascinating,

358
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,160
Speaker 2:  but especially like to get to watch it within the place that I work is gonna

359
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,680
Speaker 2:  be really, really interesting. Yeah.

360
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,160
Speaker 6:  I mean, people can go check out coral, it's a product you can just use. It's

361
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,480
Speaker 6:  there for you. That team is amazing. They have lots of ideas on how product

362
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,960
Speaker 6:  might build healthier communities.

363
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,760
Speaker 2:  The team at explanation, we should say with all the team blogs, they use

364
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,160
Speaker 2:  the hell outta coral and do some really interesting stuff. Yeah.

365
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,840
Speaker 6:  That all just runs in coral. Polygon uses coral for its comments, like lots

366
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,960
Speaker 6:  and lots of sites outside of oxygen. You use coral, coral is a product, right?

367
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,880
Speaker 6:  It's a product that you can go sign up for and use on your site. So you

368
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,840
Speaker 6:  know, that team has a lot of ideas. I think we have a lot of ideas. I've

369
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,080
Speaker 6:  said content moderation. And you said content moderation. Now I, the game

370
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,000
Speaker 6:  here is not, we're gonna have a bunch of keywords that are bad and then delete

371
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,560
Speaker 6:  the comments. The game actually is how do you build a community?

372
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,240
Speaker 6:  How do you make that space worthwhile? And the reason most publishers were

373
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,080
Speaker 6:  like, don't read the comments, whatever we'll, we'll just turn 'em off. Just

374
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,840
Speaker 6:  cause you have to invest a lot into it to make that good. And it turns out

375
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,720
Speaker 6:  just the math of every publisher is the people who comment are

376
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,360
Speaker 6:  the tiniest fraction of your audience. So you're, you're pointing the most

377
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,920
Speaker 6:  dollars at like the smallest segment of the audience. Right? I think that's

378
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,600
Speaker 6:  actually still valuable to do because hopefully that section of the audience

379
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,520
Speaker 6:  is one that loves you the most. So I, I think we just need a, we need a good

380
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,080
Speaker 6:  plan for how we're gonna grow these communities and how we're gonna make

381
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,640
Speaker 6:  it valuable. I will tell you right now, I know that the women on our staff,

382
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,240
Speaker 6:  the people of color on our staff, the non-binary folks on our staff, social,

383
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,800
Speaker 6:  media's not great for them. Yeah. You know, like we launched with a big feature

384
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,800
Speaker 6:  on star base and you should read it. Lauren Gresh wrote it for us before

385
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,240
Speaker 6:  she went off to Bloomberg. And just like in the middle, she's like being

386
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,800
Speaker 6:  a woman covering star base means people on the internet call me a bitch a

387
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,680
Speaker 6:  lot. Just a fact for her in her life. Well, I think our community should

388
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,640
Speaker 6:  have a higher standard of that. And so our writers, the reason you don't

389
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,400
Speaker 6:  pay attention to comments is like, it's still this, it has the same dynamics

390
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,520
Speaker 6:  of the internet on the comments of the New York times, which is weird. It

391
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,040
Speaker 6:  is weird. And I think we should be able to build a healthier community where

392
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,560
Speaker 6:  we actually get a closer relationship to our writers and our writers are

393
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,320
Speaker 6:  more incentivized to participate because it's a good place to be.

394
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,560
Speaker 6:  That's hard. Right. We had to like ship the first thing first

395
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,600
Speaker 6:  and get to a place where people are telling us what the next obvious thing

396
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,720
Speaker 6:  is. And then put as much thought into that and then ship that.

397
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:14,760
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I buy that. Okay. We need to take a break

398
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:18,680
Speaker 2:  and actually you and I, and Eli are gonna take a quick pause because

399
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,120
Speaker 2:  I wanna dig into a few of the things about the state of the internet that

400
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,920
Speaker 2:  you've been talking about. So I'm gonna grab a couple of folks on our product

401
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,200
Speaker 2:  team and dig into that. And then you and I will pick back up in a few minutes,

402
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,320
Speaker 2:  we'll be right back.

403
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,740
Speaker 2:  If you run an e-commerce business, you might be laser focused on

404
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:45,260
Speaker 2:  acquiring new customers, which makes sense at face value until you realize

405
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,900
Speaker 2:  that this isn't necessarily the best business model. According to a Harvard

406
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,220
Speaker 2:  study, acquiring new customers can be anywhere from five to

407
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,180
Speaker 2:  25 times more expensive than retaining existing ones. That

408
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:00,060
Speaker 2:  same study also found that increasing customer retention rates by 5%

409
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:04,380
Speaker 2:  increases profits by up to 95%, keeping your customer base engaged

410
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,980
Speaker 2:  and happy is a good way to grow, which is what the Clavio platform can help

411
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,820
Speaker 2:  you achieve. Clavio's email and SMS marketing platform brings all your

423
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,680
Speaker 7:  on day one, new parents also get up to 20 weeks of fully paid leave.

424
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:04,720
Speaker 7:  So they have the flexibility to spend time with family while making a living

425
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,720
Speaker 7:  for opportunity. Tomorrow, Amazon is investing 1.2 billion

426
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:13,040
Speaker 7:  into free technical training. That's available to over 750,000

427
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,640
Speaker 7:  associates across the country. With these programs, hourly

428
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,160
Speaker 7:  employees have the opportunity to move into higher paying highly skilled

429
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,960
Speaker 7:  jobs in fields like software engineering and robotics learn

430
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,960
Speaker 7:  more@aboutamazon.com.

431
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:39,250
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. Like we've been talking about building a new website in

432
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:43,090
Speaker 2:  2022 is a complicated thing, but like

433
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:47,010
Speaker 2:  I know that, but I really have no idea what that means

434
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,970
Speaker 2:  or what it entails. And also after weeks of testing

435
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:54,610
Speaker 2:  our new site, I'm desperate to know specifically why TikTok

436
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:58,210
Speaker 2:  embeds are so terrible. This just keeps coming up over and over again. So

437
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,050
Speaker 2:  I grabbed two people on our product team who know Matt Kreider.

438
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,890
Speaker 8:  I'm a senior engineer working on the verge right

439
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,650
Speaker 2:  Now. And Tara Cosson,

440
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:09,450
Speaker 9:  I'm a senior product manager in charge of the verge redesign and

441
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,530
Speaker 9:  platform launch for the front end of the website

442
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,730
Speaker 2:  To help me figure it out.

443
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,250
Speaker 2:  What is it like to develop on the web right now with all of the things

444
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,130
Speaker 2:  that the web is? And all of the things we were trying to like pull into this

445
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:26,290
Speaker 2:  platform is the open web, a good place to develop for right

446
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,370
Speaker 2:  now. How does that feel?

447
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:31,170
Speaker 8:  Developing on the web is complicated these days I've been

448
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:35,290
Speaker 8:  building websites since like the Geocity days and professionally

449
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:38,930
Speaker 8:  for, I don't know, 15 years or so. And it used to be, yeah, just a

450
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:42,890
Speaker 8:  PHP server, maybe you're running WordPress or ju or something. And

451
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:46,410
Speaker 8:  there wasn't too much complexity, especially on the front end right now.

452
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:50,570
Speaker 8:  So much complexities on the front ends in the browser. And there's so many

453
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:54,530
Speaker 8:  options for what sort of tools you use and people battling

454
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:58,290
Speaker 8:  which, which one is the right tool to use, to use react or view

455
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:02,210
Speaker 8:  or whatnot. So there's lots of opinions out there and lots of complexity

456
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,690
Speaker 8:  in deciding what the right tool for the job is. So

457
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:09,650
Speaker 8:  there's a lot gonna have to keep yourself up to date all the time.

458
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,970
Speaker 8:  And it's, it's a lot, lot of work to be on the cutting edge of, you know,

459
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:16,570
Speaker 8:  what's good on the web right now. And I think our platform for the verge

460
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:20,530
Speaker 8:  is a lot of cutting edge stuff. So it's really exciting to kinda work

461
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:23,850
Speaker 8:  with these new tools, but you're constantly having to learn new things.

462
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,290
Speaker 2:  Give me an example, cuz that's actually one of the things I was gonna ask

463
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:29,210
Speaker 2:  about, which is like, you guys have been doing this for a long time and I

464
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:33,170
Speaker 2:  can imagine a world in which like a, a bunch of new stuff crops up as you're

465
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,890
Speaker 2:  working on it. And you're like, no, no, no, we don't. We don't have time

466
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:37,050
Speaker 2:  to deal with this. We've we know what we're gonna build based on the stuff

467
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:40,530
Speaker 2:  that we decided to build it with two years ago, or I can imagine there's

468
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:43,480
Speaker 2:  like a shiny object syndrome where like, somebody's like, like loading a

469
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,520
Speaker 2:  GitHub page, being like, look at this crazy new thing I found every meeting

470
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,560
Speaker 2:  that you possibly have and Tara's laughing like I'm like maybe a little bit

471
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,760
Speaker 2:  right on that one a hundred percent. Right. Is there a right answer on that,

472
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,800
Speaker 2:  on the spectrum between those things? Definitely

473
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,840
Speaker 8:  A spectrum, cuz there are shiny things out there that I'm looking at like,

474
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,080
Speaker 8:  oh this will be really great, but there's so much risk with, you know, technology,

475
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,440
Speaker 8:  right?

476
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:05,320
Speaker 9:  The beauty of websites in general is, you know, if you're a product manager

477
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,000
Speaker 9:  working on an app or software, you know, you release inversions

478
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,480
Speaker 9:  and it's kind of a serious waterfall process

479
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:15,960
Speaker 9:  and you cut off at some point. And then all of a sudden, if a feature wasn't

480
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,880
Speaker 9:  included, you're, it's like you're never getting it back. Whereas the web

481
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,640
Speaker 9:  has a short memory and you can at any given moment kind of stare at staging

482
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,080
Speaker 9:  and stare at production. And if staging is better than what's on production,

483
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,600
Speaker 9:  you can choose to ship it and continue to do that every day forever, which

484
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,800
Speaker 9:  is why it's, in my opinion, at least so much more fun than working on an

485
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,680
Speaker 9:  app or software. And it's a little easier then to maybe hedge with your

486
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,560
Speaker 9:  stakeholders to say like, okay, maybe we wanna prioritize

487
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,560
Speaker 9:  shipping faster. And you know, some of these shiny new features can come

488
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,520
Speaker 9:  later and we can test as we release them and iteratively do so.

489
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,480
Speaker 9:  And it kind of gives us a little bit more freedom in that respect.

490
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:54,360
Speaker 2:  What are some of the shiny things behind the scenes at the verge for, for

491
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,880
Speaker 2:  like the web dev nerds who are gonna be poking around the verge, trying to

492
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,720
Speaker 2:  figure out what's new, what are, what are the shiniest things? I

493
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,480
Speaker 9:  Don't know if it's web dev nerds so much as editor nerds, but some

494
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,240
Speaker 9:  there's some new article leads and article formats that we'd love to

495
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,000
Speaker 9:  introduce, especially in the age of podcasting. And you know, some of our

496
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,400
Speaker 9:  third party tools are not as flexible as we'd like them to be, to really

497
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,360
Speaker 9:  get creative with embeds and things like that. But the way that we tell stories,

498
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:23,240
Speaker 9:  I think there's a limit to how creative people want the article

499
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,960
Speaker 9:  to be that they're reading. But at some point we can still create

500
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,240
Speaker 9:  something fun on a webpage.

501
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:31,080
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Is that a tricky balance? Cause I was actually thinking about this

502
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,840
Speaker 2:  the other day cuz we, where it was like that brief moment, like when snowfall

503
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,400
Speaker 2:  happened at the York times where everybody was like, the future of news on

504
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,360
Speaker 2:  the internet is like massive bespoke design and everything is

505
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,200
Speaker 2:  gonna feel new and weird and crazy. And that is, I

506
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,560
Speaker 2:  would say mercifully not where we landed generally speaking, there's still

507
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,680
Speaker 2:  some room for some of that. And like we do a lot of really cool bespoke design

508
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,480
Speaker 2:  on the verge, but this idea that like most people on the internet, we, they

509
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,800
Speaker 2:  have like come to expect a certain thing when they come to a site like ours.

510
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,760
Speaker 2:  And part of the job is to like deliver some of that as you guys are building

511
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,080
Speaker 2:  this, like, is that useful constraint? Is it annoying? Is there, is there

512
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,040
Speaker 2:  a tendency to just say like what if we blew up everything and all the texts

513
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,040
Speaker 2:  went like bottom to top just to, just to change things cuz we want to,

514
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,440
Speaker 9:  I think the product and engineering answers are gonna be different for this,

515
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,040
Speaker 9:  but on the product side, it's, it's hugely beneficial because I think

516
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:22,680
Speaker 9:  most of our readers prefer a simple experience that loads really fast.

517
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:26,440
Speaker 9:  And I think the Virgin particular does a great job of designing something

518
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,440
Speaker 9:  that facilitates the storytelling and allows the page to still load fast.

519
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:33,240
Speaker 9:  I think when design becomes a part of storytelling, you know, the magic happens

520
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,800
Speaker 9:  at, at that intersection, but the whole trend of Google amp and Facebook

521
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,040
Speaker 9:  instant and apple news, they're not necessarily going away. They are a different

522
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,280
Speaker 9:  form now than they, they were when they started, but they still rest on the

523
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,960
Speaker 9:  same hypothesis that users want faster loading webpages that have less

524
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,480
Speaker 9:  JavaScript and just are a lot simpler and Google still prioritizes

525
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:54,680
Speaker 9:  or ranks better. All of those sites that kind of fit that same

526
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,640
Speaker 9:  philosophy. And so it's forced us to think a lot more

527
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,360
Speaker 9:  seriously about page speed and the trade offs with, you know,

528
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,680
Speaker 9:  the really fancy design stuff and the animations and stuff shooting across

529
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,040
Speaker 9:  the page. You know, that's, it's really not easy to prioritize things like

530
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,560
Speaker 9:  that anymore.

531
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:13,360
Speaker 8:  I think there's a time and a place for those snowfall que articles. I mean

532
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,240
Speaker 8:  the verge does some really great ones. That was my job before I came to boxes,

533
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,760
Speaker 8:  building those sorts of articles. But yeah, I think in general when people

534
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,400
Speaker 8:  want the news, they don't always want, you know, an insane interaction.

535
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,800
Speaker 8:  They just wanna read some content.

536
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:29,320
Speaker 2:  Yeah. That's very fair. Terry, you just brought up speed, which is a thing

537
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,240
Speaker 2:  I think is really interesting that like it does seem like you can do a

538
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,120
Speaker 2:  lot of stuff on the web. There are sort of lots of options for how to do

539
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,560
Speaker 2:  anything, but the like single most important thing you have to get right

540
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,320
Speaker 2:  as your website has to be fast. And if your website is not fast, users will

541
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,560
Speaker 2:  hate you and Google will hate you and you will fail. I'm like oversimplifying

542
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,280
Speaker 2:  it. But I think like only slightly, is there anything else in the process

543
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,560
Speaker 2:  that is as important as like making the website fast?

544
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,240
Speaker 9:  Definitely the content and as much as the product and engineering teams don't

545
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,160
Speaker 9:  own that that is like 100% more important than speed. I think the quality

546
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,080
Speaker 9:  of the content is the most exciting thing as like on our side to be able

547
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,120
Speaker 9:  to build a site that has quality content is awesome. But aside from that,

548
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,480
Speaker 9:  I think that's kind of the trifecta is content speed and

549
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:14,360
Speaker 9:  design or usability. I feel like if we get those three things, right, we're

550
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,880
Speaker 9:  in really good shape, but users will excuse speed. If the content is that

551
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,720
Speaker 9:  good and vice versa, you know, it's not a totally gloss cause if you have

552
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,240
Speaker 9:  slow website, but it definitely helps. And that's like one metric that we

553
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,720
Speaker 9:  can affect. So very much our job to like make that, make that happen.

554
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:32,720
Speaker 8:  Yeah. I dunno. Content is king and that's the most important thing for Google

555
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,640
Speaker 8:  too. So that knows you have good content. Maybe it's pick two content design

556
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,480
Speaker 8:  or speed. They're all important. There's certainly like, you know, great

557
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,560
Speaker 8:  websites out there and that are terribly designed, but yeah, they all kind

558
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,760
Speaker 8:  of were contented on those three

559
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,480
Speaker 2:  Things. Yeah. The fact that Dr. Report is successful means there are a lot

560
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,240
Speaker 2:  of ways to do this stuff correctly, I suppose.

561
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:51,120
Speaker 8:  Totally. But let,

562
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,520
Speaker 2:  Let's talk about the sort of embed code internet, which is like how I've

563
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,320
Speaker 2:  come to think about it. Cuz part of what I think is an interesting challenge

564
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,040
Speaker 2:  and it comes back to kind of the building for the open web thing is like

565
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:04,000
Speaker 2:  one of the things you all set out to do is build a site that can sort

566
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,600
Speaker 2:  of consume and display all these other things. And like

567
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:10,640
Speaker 2:  YouTube is famous for having very good and bed codes and making that process

568
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,360
Speaker 2:  very easy for people to like bring other content onto your platform. I don't

569
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,200
Speaker 2:  know that any other platform is like well known for being sort of

570
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,080
Speaker 2:  famous to tap into and use this way. But we also live in a time where like

571
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,920
Speaker 2:  everything is APIs and you can start to call APIs and sort of integrate

572
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,200
Speaker 2:  other stuff into your own platforms. And I don't know, there's a lot of things

573
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,480
Speaker 2:  kind of all happening simultaneously. Like is it as hard as I would think

574
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,920
Speaker 2:  to build a thing that can sort of be a responsible

575
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,880
Speaker 2:  displayer of all of these different things all over the internet,

576
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:43,240
Speaker 8:  It's super easy to build it. It's super hard to build

577
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,160
Speaker 8:  it well. Okay. There's so many platforms that provide an

578
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,680
Speaker 8:  API or some sort of way of embedding their content into your site.

579
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:54,320
Speaker 8:  And it's pretty easy to kind of to figure that out.

580
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:58,160
Speaker 8:  Most of them use an open standard called oh embed, which

581
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:02,120
Speaker 8:  is basically you can put in a URL and the service will respond with like,

582
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,520
Speaker 8:  this is how you should embed me to your site, but once you get it in there,

583
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,480
Speaker 8:  there's so many problems as far as performance. And

584
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:13,120
Speaker 8:  then you gotta ask yourself like why is the service allowing their

585
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,000
Speaker 8:  platform to be used outside of, you know, where they can make money off of

586
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,880
Speaker 8:  it? So there's definitely some risk involved in putting in these

587
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,800
Speaker 8:  third party services, but just generally doing it in a performance

588
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,240
Speaker 8:  way is pretty tricky.

589
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:30,280
Speaker 9:  In addition to performance and speed. There's also the design question. Like

590
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,600
Speaker 9:  these things are really not that flexible. And so if you're trying to do

591
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,640
Speaker 9:  something really creative, it can be really hard to help them play well.

592
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,480
Speaker 9:  And then there's privacy concerns which Matt was alluding to. And you know,

593
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,200
Speaker 9:  if these embeds are trying to track their users on other sites on the internet

594
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,680
Speaker 9:  and dropping cookies on our site, you know, with the increasingly

595
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,680
Speaker 9:  expansive GDPR, CCPA and privacy laws all over the world,

596
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:54,640
Speaker 9:  that's just a lot of cookies to find, identify and treat properly.

597
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:57,760
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I was, I was actually gonna ask about that cuz I do think one of the

598
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,880
Speaker 2:  things that people are increasingly sensitive to largely thanks to Facebook

599
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,840
Speaker 2:  is the idea that like wherever Facebook appears in my web

600
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,560
Speaker 2:  browsing universe, Facebook gets data about me. And it's obviously not just

601
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,480
Speaker 2:  true about Facebook. It's true of lots of these platforms. Have you guys

602
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,440
Speaker 2:  thought through kind of what our job is and what it means like as the

603
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,200
Speaker 2:  verge to be a, to handle that the correct way, what is the right answer there?

604
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:22,840
Speaker 9:  It's a little bit binary. If the ed appears they can track you

605
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:26,800
Speaker 9:  so users can, should, and legally should be in many

606
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,200
Speaker 9:  places allowed to opt out, but it often means that we can't display the ed.

607
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,520
Speaker 9:  And a lot of times that is a huge part of the storytelling or the content.

608
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:37,320
Speaker 9:  So it's the user's choice, but it comes with a, a trade off for them, which

609
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,680
Speaker 9:  is unfortunate. A lot of times the reporting will say something about what

610
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,800
Speaker 9:  the tweet said, which can be hard when someone then deletes the tweet and

611
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,640
Speaker 9:  legally we're supposed to delete a tweet, but it's pretty binary, which,

612
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,480
Speaker 9:  which sucks a little

613
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,080
Speaker 8:  Bit. I think that's an interesting concept that is worth exploring. I mean

614
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,000
Speaker 8:  you can opt out of ads like with the CCPA laws in

615
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,760
Speaker 8:  California, you're legally supposed to be allowed to opt out of an ad. We

616
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,000
Speaker 8:  may have to do the same thing for end embeds because I mean, I'm no expert

617
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,880
Speaker 8:  on each platform and what sort of tracking they use, but the major ones like

618
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,760
Speaker 8:  Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, they inject like third party

619
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,720
Speaker 8:  Java script on onto your page, which can be like, they have a lot of

620
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,520
Speaker 8:  power through that little end embed window. They, they have one ability to

621
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,040
Speaker 8:  do tracking if they so choose. So I think, yeah, that's kind of a,

622
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,800
Speaker 8:  kind of a privacy gray area that is worth exploring more

623
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:29,800
Speaker 9:  As a user. You can reject ad tracking and personalized ads, but you

624
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,640
Speaker 9:  can't necessarily reject the ability to like see an ad unless it's through

625
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,080
Speaker 9:  an ad blocker. I dunno it would be nice if embeds were the same.

626
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:39,080
Speaker 2:  Well, and I think it's, it's part of, what's interesting about it is like

627
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,640
Speaker 2:  we all had this, you know, long sort of internet wide debate about like the

628
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,120
Speaker 2:  Facebook tracking pixel that was in everybody's site. And then there was

629
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,800
Speaker 2:  the like, is it worth having the sign in with Google thing in

630
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,720
Speaker 2:  exchange for, you know, the data that you're giving? And it feels like embeds

631
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,520
Speaker 2:  in a certain way are like the most complicated version of that. Because even

632
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,480
Speaker 2:  if I don't want access to the platform, like if there's a video I wanna watch,

633
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,560
Speaker 2:  I wanna watch the video. And I sort of understand why YouTube is like, well,

634
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,920
Speaker 2:  if you wanna watch the video, you have to like engage with all the pieces

635
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,840
Speaker 2:  of our platform, but then on the, on the flip side, like that sucks. And

636
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,640
Speaker 2:  so I just like where all of that is supposed to shake out and will,

637
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,960
Speaker 2:  I think is really complicated and interesting. And is the kind of thing that

638
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,320
Speaker 2:  is just like not put in front of users. Like I don't know that most people

639
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,720
Speaker 2:  think about the fact that like when I see an embedded tweet on a website

640
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:25,280
Speaker 2:  like that is in a certain way, I am now engaging with Twitter, the platform,

641
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,800
Speaker 2:  it's just a thing that is happening. And I think most people are like, just

642
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,760
Speaker 2:  not even aware of that or sort of thinking about what that interaction

643
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,280
Speaker 2:  actually looks like, which is really interesting.

644
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,240
Speaker 8:  And you don't even have to be a Twitter user or like a Facebook user, like

645
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,080
Speaker 8:  they're able to, to track you through the entire internet

646
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,360
Speaker 8:  regardless of your log in or not. I always wonder what the motivations are

647
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:49,200
Speaker 8:  for companies to open up these platforms. And like, it's pretty clear, like

648
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,720
Speaker 8:  they're getting some really useful data from folks

649
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:55,600
Speaker 2:  To that point. Actually, one of the things that has surprised me in the course

650
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,400
Speaker 2:  of testing our new site before it went live is how awful some of these embed

651
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,320
Speaker 2:  codes are. Because to your point, a lot of these companies have like a really

652
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,840
Speaker 2:  large incentive to do this really well, especially with video, which is this

653
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,680
Speaker 2:  like massively competitive space. And everybody's trying to get you to

654
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,000
Speaker 2:  post on reels instead of shorts, instead of TikTok, whatever you would think

655
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,760
Speaker 2:  everybody would be competing to like make the best, most

656
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,520
Speaker 2:  shareable thing. But then we put a TikTok in bed on our site and it's like

657
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,440
Speaker 2:  400,000 pixels tall and just randomly breaks. And autoplay is when

658
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,360
Speaker 2:  it feels like it, are these things getting better over time? Or is this just

659
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:31,960
Speaker 2:  a crappy thing that everybody seems to have kind of forgotten to make better

660
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,440
Speaker 2:  in the process?

661
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:36,760
Speaker 8:  Historically they, everything has been getting worse. I

662
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,640
Speaker 8:  mean, it's kind of risky to depend on a third party in

663
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,440
Speaker 8:  be because there's been so many examples of something of a platform

664
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,280
Speaker 8:  opening up their service to developers and then completely changing

665
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,120
Speaker 8:  how it works or shutting down. I mean, I have plenty of old websites

666
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:56,080
Speaker 8:  around that had a Google map embedded in it or, you know, an

667
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,440
Speaker 8:  Instagram feed and they just don't work anymore because they changed the

668
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,360
Speaker 8:  rules of their API. Do you all remember Vinny? Yeah.

669
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,000
Speaker 2:  Wow.

670
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,920
Speaker 8:  Video embedding service. I won't get too deep into that, but

671
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,640
Speaker 8:  like some other company bought it and completely changed what videos were

672
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,600
Speaker 8:  being accomplished on a lot of major media outlets. So there's

673
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,520
Speaker 8:  a lot of risk with embedding third party scripts or embeds.

674
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:23,680
Speaker 8:  A lot of like benefits, like Neil said that he's, we want to use the

675
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,600
Speaker 8:  entire web as a CMS, a content management system, which is really, really

676
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,360
Speaker 8:  cool. But as a developer has seen a lot of these things go bad.

677
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,840
Speaker 8:  It's, it's a little scary. Sometimes there's, there's a bit of re to throw

678
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,800
Speaker 9:  A bone to the poor product managers who are in charge of embeds at like Instagram

679
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,200
Speaker 9:  and Facebook. I feel like they're evaluated on probably two things. And one

680
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,080
Speaker 9:  of them is how much traffic are they driving back to their own feeds and

681
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,760
Speaker 9:  their own sticky experiences or retention based experiences. And then the

682
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,000
Speaker 9:  second is how much data are they collecting, which then also enables them

683
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,560
Speaker 9:  to increase signups or increase retention or whatever their other metrics

684
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,280
Speaker 9:  are. So by those respects, I'm sure that they're doing great. And I think

685
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,280
Speaker 9:  probably the, you know, our use of embeds for the redesign is probably an

686
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,360
Speaker 9:  edge case. Like it's a lot more creative than your average, you know, drop

687
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:11,200
Speaker 9:  an Instagram post in a, a story and, and let it take over the

688
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,120
Speaker 9:  whole width of the column and, and be a little annoying. So in defense

689
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,480
Speaker 9:  of those product managers, I'm sure that they're hitting their metrics, but

690
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:22,080
Speaker 9:  it would be really nice if there were just a couple more options

691
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,920
Speaker 9:  for like max widths that you could set that were a little bit smaller.

692
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:29,960
Speaker 9:  Ah-huh any product managers listening. I will happily send you a really

693
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,640
Speaker 9:  fancy, fancy gift basket. If in the next year you can

694
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,200
Speaker 9:  ship something like that for us would be awesome. The poor

695
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,520
Speaker 9:  publishers need some help.

696
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,440
Speaker 8:  Dark Mo toggle would be good. Ooh.

697
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:44,160
Speaker 2:  Yes. Dark Mo toggle. Okay. This is good. We're just gonna, we'll end this

698
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,760
Speaker 2:  with just like a long list of things that we'd like people to build for us.

699
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,160
Speaker 2:  That seems, that seems like it'd be good. No, the last thing I wanna talk

700
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,480
Speaker 2:  about before I let you go, is the future proofing kinda like you, you were

701
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,280
Speaker 2:  talking about Matt, because I think one of the interesting moments that we're

702
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,360
Speaker 2:  at right now, like you guys are saying is like the web is changing really

703
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,200
Speaker 2:  fast. The platforms are changing really fast. The odds that all

704
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,040
Speaker 2:  the platforms we're using and embedding right now are gonna be here or

705
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:11,120
Speaker 2:  relevant in 10 years when we do this again is like vanishingly small. So

706
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:15,080
Speaker 2:  as you guys are going through this process, I guess a how far out

707
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,840
Speaker 2:  into the future, is it even sort of useful to think given how quickly

708
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,720
Speaker 2:  everything changes and then also like, is there stuff you can do in this

709
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,560
Speaker 2:  process to sort of give it the longest possible shelf

710
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,360
Speaker 2:  life? Part of developing for tech to me just seems like you just have to

711
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,680
Speaker 2:  get comfortable with the idea that every two years you're gonna have to throw

712
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,960
Speaker 2:  everything out and start over because everything just seems to change all

713
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,680
Speaker 2:  the time. Is there stuff that you can and have done to mitigate any of that?

714
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:42,720
Speaker 8:  The short term problem is kind of working with some of the performance issues

715
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,520
Speaker 8:  that are coming with embedding lots and lots of third party content onto

716
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:50,320
Speaker 8:  site long term. It's a really interesting question. One of the recommendations

717
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,840
Speaker 8:  like by, by Google is to use an image of

718
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:57,480
Speaker 8:  DM embed. So like an image of a tweet, they call it, I think they call it

719
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,440
Speaker 8:  a facet. And only when you interact with that image, like hover over,

720
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,280
Speaker 8:  it will actually load the content. So that's kind of a best

721
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,320
Speaker 8:  practice that is really hard to do, but I think is really worth looking

722
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:13,200
Speaker 8:  into with the side effect that third party ed stopped

723
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,360
Speaker 8:  working in a couple years. You still have that image,

724
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,880
Speaker 9:  Which is definitely illegal and you can definitely get sued for that.

725
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,400
Speaker 9:  I definitely don't speak from experience.

726
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,960
Speaker 8:  I don't worry about that part.

727
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,880
Speaker 2:  Tara, what about you? What are you thinking about as, as you think about

728
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,760
Speaker 2:  like the next 1, 2, 5 years of this project, like has, have you

729
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,080
Speaker 2:  had to think about that stuff over the last couple of years?

730
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,720
Speaker 9:  Definitely. And I'll kind of answer your question with a question, which

731
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,640
Speaker 9:  is how long should some of this stuff live anyway. And I

732
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,480
Speaker 9:  think in, in one respect to play a part in the public record, it it's important.

733
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,680
Speaker 9:  And it's important that this stuff live forever, at least in some way,

734
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,200
Speaker 9:  but it doesn't mean that like every Instagram post should live forever. Every

735
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,240
Speaker 9:  TikTok should live forever. I think the law maybe made the right call that

736
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,960
Speaker 9:  people should be able to take down their Instagram posts and actually disappear

737
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,120
Speaker 9:  from the internet instead of having like screenshots of things everywhere.

738
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,560
Speaker 9:  Although I really still to this day, I don't know how lawyers like find these

739
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,960
Speaker 9:  screenshots sprinkled everywhere, but two years feels like a great shelf

740
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,840
Speaker 9:  life for like the end embeds in an article. And if people take them down,

741
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,800
Speaker 9:  I feel like that's totally fair. And, and it makes some sense. And by then,

742
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,320
Speaker 9:  hopefully we've moved on to newer and better things and people can,

743
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,960
Speaker 9:  whatever the next social network is.

744
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:23,000
Speaker 8:  I don't think there's a technological answer to this because otherwise all

745
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,760
Speaker 8:  these, all my old websites would still be working, but content people

746
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,600
Speaker 8:  exist without this ed, you know, images all have out text for

747
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,480
Speaker 8:  screen readers. So maybe this, the text surrounding the, the VE

748
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,200
Speaker 8:  should be able to describe what it was because it probably

749
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,240
Speaker 8:  will go away one day.

750
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:43,160
Speaker 2:  Then the sort of the job for us as the verge is to like

751
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,080
Speaker 2:  preserve the stuff that we make in a way that stands the sense of time, rather

752
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:51,040
Speaker 2:  than sort of worry about trying to like archive the

753
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,560
Speaker 2:  entire internet into our own servers.

754
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:57,200
Speaker 9:  So many products and especially social products are skewing ephemeral. Not

755
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,680
Speaker 9:  that that's a hip word anymore, but you know, it makes sense that, you know,

756
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,240
Speaker 9:  news is ephemeral too. It just has a bit of a longer shelf life. And thinking

757
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,080
Speaker 9:  of it that way gives me a little bit of peace with the trash embeds that

758
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,360
Speaker 9:  we find on our site sometimes.

759
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:13,840
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And listen, we have stuff on our site from 10 years ago that it's just

760
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:17,640
Speaker 2:  horribly broken and it, I still enjoy it every time I land on it. So it's,

761
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,000
Speaker 2:  it's all right.

762
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:20,960
Speaker 9:  I don't know if vine and embed still work, but it would be cool if

763
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,720
Speaker 2:  They did somebody find a VI, me ed, and, and tweeted at us

764
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,920
Speaker 2:  and we'll see if it works. I'm very excited about

765
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,480
Speaker 9:  It. You know, nothing lives forever. And it, it makes sense that you know,

766
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,240
Speaker 9:  every now and then it makes sense to start from scratch and build a new platform

767
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:38,000
Speaker 9:  in whatever the latest programming languages are. It's like helpful for attracting

768
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,680
Speaker 9:  great engineering talent. Like Matt, it's helpful for making sure that we

769
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,160
Speaker 9:  can reevaluate and cut out features that we're not using anymore. It's a

770
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,560
Speaker 9:  good opportunity to take advantage of site speed or whatever other things

771
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,040
Speaker 9:  can like help us create a more performant website. So it's

772
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:55,960
Speaker 9:  bittersweet to launch a new stack sometimes because so much work

773
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,920
Speaker 9:  and so many beautiful features went into the old one. But you know, that's

774
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,840
Speaker 9:  ephemeral too, I guess.

775
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:05,440
Speaker 2:  Well, thank you both for doing this congrats on, you know, the end of not

776
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,880
Speaker 2:  the end, but the end of two years of work in the beginning of I'm sure many

777
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,760
Speaker 2:  more years of work,

778
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,120
Speaker 9:  It's only the beginning.

779
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:11,240
Speaker 8:  Oh yeah.

780
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:15,880
Speaker 2:  All right. We're gonna take a quick break. And when we get back, we're gonna

781
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,600
Speaker 2:  get back to Eli and get real big picture and philosophical

782
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,520
Speaker 2:  about the future of Google, the future of search and the relationship

783
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,160
Speaker 2:  with the verge and digital media and the future of everything. We'll

784
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,570
Speaker 10:  People love what's next, the big new thing that everyone has to

785
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:44,250
Speaker 10:  have, but how do you fight through the idea ending silos, barriers and

786
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:47,930
Speaker 10:  endless meetings with Smartsheet? Just lay out the perfect process

787
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,530
Speaker 10:  then grab the best people and resources, automate tasks

788
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:55,330
Speaker 10:  and meet every change with flexibility, everybody together,

789
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:59,050
Speaker 10:  delivering great work and ready for what's next. Visit

Speaker 11:  Hi, I'm Kara Swisher for decades. I've covered Silicon valley, Washington

792
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:12,010
Speaker 11:  and Hollywood making sense of those worlds by talking directly to the

793
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:16,050
Speaker 11:  people who shape them. Elon Musk, Barack Obama, Tony Fauci,

794
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:19,290
Speaker 11:  Kim Kardashian. I've had the pleasure of grilling them all.

795
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:23,490
Speaker 11:  Now I'm launching a new show called the Joe Rogan experience with Kara

796
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:27,180
Speaker 11:  Swisher. Just kidding. It's actually called on with Kara

797
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:30,900
Speaker 11:  Swisher. And let me tell you it is on no holds

798
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,660
Speaker 11:  barred on the tough questions or on my opinions on with Kara

799
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:38,420
Speaker 11:  Swisher launches September 26th from New York magazine and the Vox media

800
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:42,060
Speaker 11:  podcast network. Just look for on with Kara Swisher in your podcast

802
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:55,480
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. And Eli, welcome back. Hey buddy, let's talk about

803
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:59,240
Speaker 2:  Google, because my sense is that a big part of the future of

804
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:03,000
Speaker 2:  media thinking that led to this redesign was that basically

805
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:06,920
Speaker 2:  we wanna be less reliant on Google as a thing. We've talked

806
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,840
Speaker 2:  about platforms we've talked about video, but the honest reality is that

807
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:14,720
Speaker 2:  Google is the main driving force behind most publishers traffic, I

808
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,560
Speaker 2:  assume, including our, so what is the bet here on the

809
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,280
Speaker 2:  future of Google and the verge?

810
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:24,200
Speaker 6:  Oh man, that is a spicy question. So lemme just put that whole thing into

811
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,600
Speaker 6:  context. So I think a lot of people are very familiar with

812
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,440
Speaker 6:  Facebook's relationship to the media, right? There was a point I think in

813
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,240
Speaker 6:  early 2013 or 2014, where Facebook just started firing

814
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,840
Speaker 6:  traffic in the media sites like news on Facebook took off, everyone realized

815
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:42,320
Speaker 6:  it, there was a land grab of like, can we make kitty video

816
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:46,360
Speaker 6:  webpages for Facebook? Right? And some publishers were massively successful.

817
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,040
Speaker 6:  Then Facebook was like, we're turning that off. And they turned it off. And

818
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,080
Speaker 6:  a lot of publishers collapsed.

819
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:53,400
Speaker 2:  There's literally like a knob in Menlo park that they were just like, nevermind.

820
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:53,920
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

821
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,600
Speaker 6:  They were, they were done newsfeed update, you know, number seven. And then

822
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,760
Speaker 6:  that traffic went away for publishers, right? Because it was dicey for Facebook,

823
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,800
Speaker 6:  right? They were promoting some content, not promoting some content, the

824
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:07,160
Speaker 6:  politics. So that got tortured. That's a long story. I'll just stop it there.

825
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:11,680
Speaker 6:  Then Facebook was like, video is gonna be the thing. And they published a

826
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,360
Speaker 6:  bunch of inflated inaccurate video numbers. They've since copped to it many

827
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:19,320
Speaker 6:  times, a bunch of publishers pivoted to video, right? They shut down

828
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:23,040
Speaker 6:  their newsrooms made everybody make videos. Buzzfeed put rubber bands around

829
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,760
Speaker 6:  a watermelon until they exploded. You might remember. And everyone thought

830
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,720
Speaker 6:  Facebook video was gonna be business. And then Facebook turned it off and

831
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,440
Speaker 6:  their businesses collapsed. And a bunch of people got laid off. That cycle

832
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,840
Speaker 6:  actually repeats outside of Facebook all the time. So our first big traffic

833
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:38,480
Speaker 6:  fire hose, when we, when launched the verge in 2011 was Yahoo. Yep.

834
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,160
Speaker 6:  Yahoo would just send us floods of traffic. And we would, we would not know

835
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:41,360
Speaker 6:  why

836
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,960
Speaker 2:  You've told the Phish stories story on the podcast. Right.

837
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,160
Speaker 6:  I don't know if I told about this, but yes, we, we like did the analysis

838
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,520
Speaker 6:  of where the Yahoo traffic came from and we're like, Yahoo loves stories

839
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,400
Speaker 6:  about Phish. So on like very slow Fridays, we would just Google Phish

840
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:57,240
Speaker 6:  technology. There's a great story. Josh, ER, wrote a story about

841
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,960
Speaker 6:  the whoosh fish cannon that like repopulates salmon by like shooting them

842
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,880
Speaker 6:  off of ramp. It's ridiculous. Yahoo loves the story. That's like

843
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,440
Speaker 6:  the worst incentive. Right? Right. You're like, here's what the algorithm

844
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,080
Speaker 6:  wants. Now. The verge is about fish. Like it makes no sense the audience

845
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:13,280
Speaker 6:  except for the apparently massive Yahoo fish audience. But you, you just

846
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,720
Speaker 6:  kind of like get buffeted around by other people's algorithms. The reason

847
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,880
Speaker 6:  we don't talk about Google that way is cuz Google for years has basically

848
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,720
Speaker 6:  been stable. Right? And Google's algorithm is essentially the most transparent.

849
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,040
Speaker 6:  It's not actually transparent, but the input in the output is understood.

850
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:30,880
Speaker 6:  A lot of people are searching for what time the super bowl is. So if you

851
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,440
Speaker 6:  publish a page that says, what time is the super bowl, Google will efficiently

852
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,760
Speaker 6:  match supply and demand.

853
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,760
Speaker 2:  Right? And the difference is just to put a point on that, like this is, I

854
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,800
Speaker 2:  think you actually said this to me a while ago that like the difference is

855
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,680
Speaker 2:  there's at least an input to Google that like the one way to understand the

856
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:48,000
Speaker 2:  output is, is as a function of the input. Whereas on like Facebook and other

857
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,640
Speaker 2:  stuff, the input is just like magical, unknown, special sauce.

858
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,040
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

859
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,960
Speaker 6:  You just open Facebook and stuff happens to you.

860
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:57,440
Speaker 2:  Right? You don't tell Facebook. I would like to watch videos about Phish,

861
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,840
Speaker 2:  Facebook just figures out that you would like Phish. So at least Google is

862
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:04,040
Speaker 2:  like, the line is not perfectly straight, but there is at least a line from

863
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,560
Speaker 2:  the beginning to the end. Yeah.

864
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:09,440
Speaker 6:  It it's in there somewhere. And so like most publishers have a Google stride.

865
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,120
Speaker 6:  We were very lucky. We, we published a lot of reviews, people search for

866
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,440
Speaker 6:  reviews. You know, we published a lot of explainers about tech, which is,

867
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:20,440
Speaker 6:  I think a good audience service people search for explainers. So just like

868
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,720
Speaker 6:  everybody, we get a lot of Google traffic. We get a lot of traffic from the

869
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,280
Speaker 6:  Google news box, but our homepage right up there, it's the second source

870
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,360
Speaker 6:  of our own traffic. Right. People come to our home page, they click on something

871
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:32,160
Speaker 6:  else. So we had this opportunity that most publishers don't have, which is

872
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,760
Speaker 6:  that our own website drives us a lot of traffic. That's where the opportunity

873
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,720
Speaker 6:  comes from. If we had all bailed and tried to start a new site, we, I think

874
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,920
Speaker 6:  this would've failed. We, we don't have that huge asset, which is the verge

875
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,400
Speaker 6:  audience. So we can deliver a better product to like, it's the easiest sale

876
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,080
Speaker 6:  in the game? Like how do you double the revenue of

877
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:52,560
Speaker 6:  Chick-fil-A you just open it on Sundays? Like you just like,

878
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:57,240
Speaker 6:  it's like the easiest proposition in business. So like ours is we just take

879
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,640
Speaker 6:  this thing that people already are telling us. They like by clicking all

880
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,200
Speaker 6:  day and just like make it better, more useful. But I just think I look at

881
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,400
Speaker 6:  Google and I look at this dependency that no one talks about cuz it does

882
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,240
Speaker 6:  feel stable. It does feel understandable. Google is generally

883
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,040
Speaker 6:  honest with publishers. That's what the business side of our business tells

884
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,600
Speaker 6:  me. And I said, well Google, what if it goes away? Right? Like

885
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:20,480
Speaker 6:  everything else in my career in publishing has gone away. I should have some

886
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,800
Speaker 6:  hedge against whether this thing goes away and maybe it won't maybe, you

887
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,320
Speaker 6:  know, people will search forever and Google will send them to us forever.

888
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:30,240
Speaker 6:  Like that would be great. I'm not saying I, I absolutely 100%

889
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,280
Speaker 6:  think it's gonna go away. But I feel like we should all be hedged against

890
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,040
Speaker 6:  what if the thing goes away because the history of digital media is that

891
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,840
Speaker 6:  the thing goes away. So the one hand it's okay, how do I hedge it? And then

892
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,960
Speaker 6:  it's on the other hand, it's like, how do you become the thing? Right? So

893
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,040
Speaker 6:  Ben Thompson, who we talk about in the show, lot, he became famous for what

894
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,200
Speaker 6:  he calls aggregation theory, which can go read and he's like power on the

895
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:52,160
Speaker 6:  internet. Doesn't come from having the supply. It doesn't come from having

896
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,880
Speaker 6:  the product. It comes from owning the demand. And so Google owns the demand

897
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:59,560
Speaker 6:  and they people tell Google what they want. And Google sends you someplace

898
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:03,400
Speaker 6:  to fulfill your demand. And that puts Google in an enormous position of power.

899
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:07,440
Speaker 6:  I think our new site can solve some that, right? Like I think we can say

900
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,240
Speaker 6:  to people, come here, if you are interested in what's cool on the internet

901
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,840
Speaker 6:  or what's interesting in tech and we'll send you to those places,

902
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,480
Speaker 6:  are we, are we gonna be the size of Google? We are not, but are we gonna

903
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,280
Speaker 6:  change our relationship to the audience as opposed to just providing

904
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,600
Speaker 6:  things to Google? I hope so. Yeah.

905
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,200
Speaker 2:  And I think, I mean the, the what time does the super bowl start thing is

906
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,560
Speaker 2:  an interesting one, right? Cuz it's like, that is both sort of like all the

907
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,080
Speaker 2:  people who write that it's like naked internet cynicism where it's like,

908
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,240
Speaker 2:  okay, people wanna know this, I'm gonna write something with that exact headline,

909
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,280
Speaker 2:  but it's also audience service. People wanna know when the Superbowl starts,

910
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:40,040
Speaker 2:  but the thing that Google will do and if it hasn't yet, I'd be honestly

911
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,440
Speaker 2:  surprised that I'm sure that it will is just put up one of those knowledge

912
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:46,320
Speaker 2:  boxes that says the Superbowl starts at 6:30 PM. And like we

913
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:50,120
Speaker 2:  we've seen a lot of data recently about like the zero click Google search

914
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:54,080
Speaker 2:  and how much Google is adding to search results in such a

915
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,360
Speaker 2:  way that a there's a hundred thousand ads before you get to any actual search

916
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:01,080
Speaker 2:  results. And B Google has more and more incentive to a keep

917
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:05,000
Speaker 2:  you within Google so that you don't leave and B to send you

918
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,800
Speaker 2:  to its own stuff. So like Google is really happy to send you to

919
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,640
Speaker 2:  YouTube and really happy to just answer your questions rather than

920
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:16,480
Speaker 2:  sort of be the like neutral arbiter of everything that it once

921
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,400
Speaker 2:  was. And I haven't totally decided how much I buy

922
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,040
Speaker 2:  the, the sort of conspiracy theory around Google's end game there, whether

923
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:27,760
Speaker 2:  it's to like capture all of that for itself forever or what, but

924
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:32,000
Speaker 2:  it does seem like the trend there is Google is like closing at

925
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,520
Speaker 2:  least ever so slightly. And a lot of people are gonna have to reckon, I think,

926
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,960
Speaker 2:  with what that means over time.

927
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:40,400
Speaker 6:  Yeah. If you just step back and you're like, what would make the best search

928
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,440
Speaker 6:  experience? It's like you ask Google a question, it tells you the answer.

929
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:47,240
Speaker 6:  I don't think that's controversial. Like if you ask it what time something

930
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:51,160
Speaker 6:  is, just tell you like that's commodity information, the idea that you have

931
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:54,080
Speaker 6:  to click onto someone else's website and load their like that's, that's like

932
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:57,680
Speaker 6:  nonsensical, like, you know, like, should Google have a built-in stopwatch

933
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,000
Speaker 6:  or should it send traffic to stopwatch companies? Like, I that's it's like

934
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,440
Speaker 6:  fundamentally at some point it's just ridiculous. Right. But it is true that

935
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:08,320
Speaker 6:  Google's money is search. Like that's still where they make all the

936
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:11,920
Speaker 6:  money. They make a money on YouTube and nothing else makes money.

937
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:16,600
Speaker 6:  And like that's weird, right? Yeah. Like their ads network and they own the

938
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:20,080
Speaker 6:  entire ad tech stack they're in the first or second position of every layer

939
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:23,640
Speaker 6:  of the ad tech stack with one of their divisions. So like Google monetizes,

940
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:27,600
Speaker 6:  the internet, but like really the money is in surgery. Yep. Okay. Well, if

941
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:31,320
Speaker 6:  you want to make more money, is Google in an uncertain economic

942
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:35,040
Speaker 6:  time? What lever might you pull? You might keep more search. Like,

943
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:38,800
Speaker 6:  I don't know. It's not like a, I don't know it for sure. It's not an

944
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,600
Speaker 6:  accusation I'm making. It's just, when I think about the future of our website,

945
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:46,640
Speaker 6:  how do I build a hedge against the thing that always happens, which is the

946
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,560
Speaker 6:  thing goes away and might I understand a mechanism of this

947
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:54,000
Speaker 6:  thing going away and like you can see one that exists and then on top of

948
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,920
Speaker 6:  it, like what's the real goal. The verge should be fun is hell to read. So

949
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:00,520
Speaker 6:  if I can solve like this weird business problem with a cool

950
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,920
Speaker 6:  thing, we should just make the coolest thing.

951
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:05,960
Speaker 2:  Yeah. If we can make a place, people wanna hang out, that's a pretty easy

952
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,120
Speaker 2:  win that solves a lot of problems.

953
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:11,080
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And hang out at scale, that's the verge, right? It, I always say

954
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,440
Speaker 6:  it's a big thing that feels really small. I, I hope it feels really small

955
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:18,320
Speaker 6:  to people. And I think actually for Vergecast listeners, the verge feels

956
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,400
Speaker 6:  smallest of all right. It's like this tiny group of people that they hang

957
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,920
Speaker 6:  out with, they tell, well, get emails. It feels like I'm hanging out with

958
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,400
Speaker 6:  you guys. Our home, our whole homepage should feel like that to everybody.

959
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:30,520
Speaker 2:  If we were starting the verge right now, like the verge is 11 years old.

960
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:33,720
Speaker 2:  And like you said, we have this, this longstanding homepage

961
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:37,680
Speaker 2:  first.com. It's very good website that people go to on purpose. If that

962
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,920
Speaker 2:  wasn't the case and we were starting from nothing, would we have done it

963
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,320
Speaker 2:  the same way? Like do you think you can build that

964
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,720
Speaker 2:  direct audience from nothing in 20, 22?

965
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:51,680
Speaker 2:  Or can we only even try this because of like the

966
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,720
Speaker 2:  history and credibility that we have with people.

967
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:57,840
Speaker 6:  So I think that's a really good question. I think we have seen a lot of activity

968
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:01,560
Speaker 6:  around this question in ways that maybe is not expressed in the form of websites.

969
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,880
Speaker 6:  Hmm. So why do people start newsletters instead of websites

970
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:09,200
Speaker 6:  now? Because they can send the newsletter right. To you and what does our

971
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,320
Speaker 6:  homepage really look like? Right. Like part of it looks like a newsfeed.

972
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,640
Speaker 6:  Part of it looks like Twitter. Part of it looks like we're just live writing

973
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,600
Speaker 6:  a newsletter every day. Like most great newsletters platform are by Casey

974
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,680
Speaker 6:  Hotpod by Ariel. Like if you just abstract them into what they are, it's

975
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:26,440
Speaker 6:  a, an essay and then a bunch of blurbs about

976
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:30,360
Speaker 6:  news. Like there's a curation function. That's built into all the best

977
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:34,320
Speaker 6:  newsletters. Well, that's our homepage now. Right? It's a bunch of cool

978
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:38,120
Speaker 6:  curation and then a lot of columns and essays and reports and features and

979
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,400
Speaker 6:  whatever else. Yep. There's similarities there to how people are building

980
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,960
Speaker 6:  direct audiences. I just think getting people to come to your

981
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:48,760
Speaker 6:  website is an ever increasing ask, getting people to

982
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,800
Speaker 6:  sign up for your newsletter is actually way easier. So I think you see people

983
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:52,720
Speaker 6:  doing that way faster.

984
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:56,920
Speaker 2:  Okay. Yeah. I mean, it makes sense. And I think the, how do people come to

985
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,120
Speaker 2:  you? Thing is forever interesting, right? Cause it's like if I have a newsletter,

986
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,640
Speaker 2:  I have to open my email app, which I'm already conditioned to do all the

987
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,240
Speaker 2:  time. Like if you're in my YouTube subscriptions, you're just, you're just

988
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:08,200
Speaker 2:  in places I already am. And like, I think your point that even if

989
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,080
Speaker 2:  I'm already in my browser, that activity of like opening a new tab and typing

990
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:14,880
Speaker 2:  in the verge.com and hitting enter is like a not small thing

991
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,240
Speaker 2:  to ask of people. And I, I do wonder if that's like a learned behavior that

992
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,840
Speaker 2:  people who have it have it and people who don't are never gonna learn it.

993
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,200
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

994
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,680
Speaker 6:  I'll give you an example of some like homepages I go to, I have the muscle

995
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:29,600
Speaker 6:  memory of just typing cnn.com three times a day. Sure.

996
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:33,120
Speaker 6:  There's a reason for that. It's because of CNN, they know they have one of

997
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:36,440
Speaker 6:  the biggest homepages in all of media and they're just constantly rotating

998
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,240
Speaker 6:  stuff out. Yep. Right? Like, unless something huge is happening, the CNN

999
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:42,520
Speaker 6:  homepage is always changing. There's a homepage editor. Like they are moving

1000
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:46,200
Speaker 6:  that page to make it valuable for you. Every time you come back to it,

1001
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:50,160
Speaker 6:  most places don't care about their homepage anymore. You I'm sure anybody

1002
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,440
Speaker 6:  listening to this who works in media or ads or marketing, whatever has heard

1003
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,520
Speaker 6:  this inter conversation with something called side doors, which basically

1004
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:00,120
Speaker 6:  means everybody comes to you on your article page, through a platform instead

1005
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:04,080
Speaker 6:  of ever going to your homepage, which is why article pages are fast

1006
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:07,680
Speaker 6:  tuned with garbage, right? They're everyone tries to make their article page,

1007
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:11,560
Speaker 6:  do the jobs of a homepage and get you to click on one more story or

1008
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,320
Speaker 6:  get you to sign up for something else. We all have the same feelings about

1009
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,280
Speaker 6:  that. If you can just make the homepage valuable every time people open it,

1010
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,600
Speaker 6:  which you can do with a newsfeed, you can, I hope we can build some of that

1011
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,680
Speaker 6:  muscle memory where reward people for actually coming to our website.

1012
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:27,920
Speaker 2:  Okay. All right. And then last thing is like, just talk to

1013
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,320
Speaker 2:  me about web design. This is like a, a thing we at the verge care deeply

1014
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,720
Speaker 2:  about. And I feel like it's an interesting moment again, as you're talking

1015
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:37,560
Speaker 2:  about to like, think how should a website look like the last time we

1016
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:41,200
Speaker 2:  did this, I wasn't here, but I'm assuming having been through like similar

1017
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,200
Speaker 2:  things at different places, there's this question of like, back then, it

1018
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:47,040
Speaker 2:  was like, okay, we have a desktop audience and we have a mobile audience.

1019
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,400
Speaker 2:  And the, the like responsive web was a thing that everybody talked about.

1020
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,000
Speaker 2:  Right. And now it's just like, if you don't start with phones, you're blowing

1021
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,120
Speaker 2:  it because that's how most people will experience you at all times. And like

1022
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:59,600
Speaker 2:  the version com looks very different now than it did in the past.

1023
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:02,760
Speaker 2:  Yeah. But I wouldn't say it's like structurally

1024
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,920
Speaker 2:  completely overhauled. It's not like, you're like the internet doesn't

1025
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,400
Speaker 2:  need headlines and we're gonna put the images at the bottom.

1026
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:11,640
Speaker 6:  We should do that. I don't know like where, where have you been?

1027
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:16,520
Speaker 2:  But like, was there ever a moment where it was like, is there a

1028
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:19,880
Speaker 2:  blow up in how we think about what a news website could look like

1029
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:23,400
Speaker 2:  process? Like how far down that road did we go? Pretty

1030
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:27,200
Speaker 6:  Far. Okay. I think one thing maybe people should take note of

1031
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,160
Speaker 6:  here is we've mostly talked about how the site works. Yep. We have

1032
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:34,640
Speaker 6:  not talked about how it looks, but it looks totally different. It's beautiful.

1033
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:38,000
Speaker 6:  We have a new logo. We haven't talked about the new logo for one second,

1034
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,920
Speaker 6:  right? Like at the core of this, what we, what we spent all of our

1035
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,880
Speaker 6:  time thinking about is how does this site work? What is the software product

1036
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:49,200
Speaker 6:  that we are shipping to millions of people a day? How does it operate? And

1037
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,960
Speaker 6:  then how does our team run it? Right. We changed where all the

1038
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,360
Speaker 6:  buttons are. Like we have to assign people to push the buttons. So we had

1039
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:00,120
Speaker 6:  to like restructure our team a little bit to support this task that said

1040
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,600
Speaker 6:  the site looks way different. Right. And we have thought really long and

1041
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:07,440
Speaker 6:  hard about how it looks on mobile, of course, but also just like, how

1042
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,600
Speaker 6:  does a news page work? What should that experience be?

1043
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,320
Speaker 6:  I'll give you this really dumb example. So we actually launched the verge

1044
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:17,920
Speaker 6:  without a great mobile site. All of our readers were on desktop in 2011.

1045
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:21,080
Speaker 6:  And if you'll remember, we had like 95 apps. We had like a windows phone

1046
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,000
Speaker 6:  app. Oh

1047
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:22,360
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

1048
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:25,680
Speaker 6:  And somewhere along the way, we're like this and what are we doing? So we

1049
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,720
Speaker 6:  shut down all these apps. So it cost so much to maintain. And it was really

1050
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,200
Speaker 6:  hard to ship the web into apps back then for a variety of reasons.

1051
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:35,560
Speaker 6:  That's a lot easier. Maybe we'll have an app today, not today, tell the CEO

1052
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:39,360
Speaker 6:  I want an app. So then we shut that all down. We added a mobile page to the

1053
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:42,880
Speaker 6:  old design. And then when we redesign the verge, if you just look at that

1054
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,880
Speaker 6:  redesign, yep. We had a bunch of new elements, but we just cleaned it up

1055
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:49,080
Speaker 6:  for mobile. Right. That was like the big thrust of that redesign. When you

1056
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:52,720
Speaker 6:  talk about distributed publishing is we've gotta pair this thing down

1057
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:56,160
Speaker 6:  to its most essential elements so that when

1058
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,960
Speaker 6:  Facebook instant articles like re constitutes a webpage, it still looks like

1059
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,360
Speaker 6:  us. That whole redesign was just about refinement and like

1060
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:08,600
Speaker 6:  minimizing what we needed to convey that we were the verge. And that really

1061
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:12,360
Speaker 6:  is where neon colors came from. These are bright pink.

1062
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:16,040
Speaker 6:  You see it that's us like that. We were like dead on with that.

1063
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:19,600
Speaker 6:  We had all those like laser lines everywhere. Why? Because we wanted people

1064
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:23,520
Speaker 6:  to see the laser line and know that was us. This redesign

1065
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:26,680
Speaker 6:  carries a lot of that through, right. We know people are gonna mostly see

1066
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:30,160
Speaker 6:  us on phones, but a lot of it is the phones are huge. Now.

1067
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:33,960
Speaker 6:  Like the screens are really big so we can do. And the, everybody has a retina

1068
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,760
Speaker 6:  screen. Now that wasn't necessarily true when we last redesign the site.

1069
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:41,240
Speaker 6:  So we can go to things, likes fonts. We can have different kinds

1070
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:44,920
Speaker 6:  of images on the page. We can make the images bigger. In some cases we can

1071
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:48,280
Speaker 6:  make the images smaller actually, cuz they're still big. So there's just

1072
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:52,160
Speaker 6:  a lot of that tweaking for like the modern era. And then there's also just

1073
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,120
Speaker 6:  the recognition. This is like some real verge stuff. That image

1074
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:59,920
Speaker 6:  aspect ratios are all over the place now. Yep. So the first

1075
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,400
Speaker 6:  verge was a 16 by nine website. Like

1076
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:07,360
Speaker 6:  that's what it was. And it was designed to produce 16 by nine images

1077
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:10,800
Speaker 6:  on a landscape desktop display. This is like, we have to be

1078
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,200
Speaker 6:  comfortable with portrait images. We have to be comfortable with square images.

1079
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:17,960
Speaker 6:  So there's actually a lot of backend work to just support and deliver

1080
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,920
Speaker 6:  the right aspect, ratio of image in the right article at the right time.

1081
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:24,320
Speaker 6:  And it's not, the headlines are at the bottom like level

1082
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:28,680
Speaker 6:  web redesign thinking. It's more like actually a mobile article

1083
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:32,640
Speaker 6:  page has to deliver to a phone with assets or a phone

1084
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,080
Speaker 6:  native and maybe the desktop version should look totally different.

1085
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:38,520
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I mean that, that to me, like, even as we've been, you know, beta testing,

1086
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:42,160
Speaker 2:  this thing like discovering what a TikTok in embed looks like

1087
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:46,080
Speaker 2:  when you just make it, its own thing is deeply hilarious and trying

1088
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:49,960
Speaker 2:  to figure out how to like pull all of that stuff into one place in a

1089
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:53,440
Speaker 2:  way that they all make sense next to all of the other stuff that we all do

1090
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:56,520
Speaker 2:  turned out to be way harder than I expected. And is the kind of thing that

1091
01:01:56,650 --> 01:02:00,320
Speaker 2:  no one has ever really done. Right? Like most news websites are

1092
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:04,280
Speaker 2:  text, right? Like it is, it is overwhelmingly paragraphs of text and

1093
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,840
Speaker 2:  images. And we we've been through this a million times when you try to build

1094
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:09,400
Speaker 2:  something else, you have to like build a sort of bespoke thing that can contain

1095
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,840
Speaker 2:  it. And then you go to the video apps and they support video. And then even

1096
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,520
Speaker 2:  when you get like the landscape video and the vertical video app, it looks

1097
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:19,440
Speaker 2:  bad. And this task of figuring out how to sort of, of be

1098
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,320
Speaker 2:  all things to all people with all media is

1099
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,760
Speaker 2:  fascinating and it's gonna be like, we definitely have not fully solved that

1100
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:30,200
Speaker 2:  problem. And no one has, and there's a lot left to do. But I think like that's

1101
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:33,480
Speaker 2:  where all of this has to go because this stuff just is so multimedia now.

1102
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:37,280
Speaker 6:  Yeah. You sound like a 1990s, Cedar rom under. I

1103
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,080
Speaker 2:  Know I love it.

1104
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:41,600
Speaker 6:  What we've shipped here today is Microsoft and cartel. We hope you like it

1105
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:45,360
Speaker 6:  you'll need at least a four X speed CD rom drive to make it work in a 3 86,

1106
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,840
Speaker 2:  It comes on 11 CD,

1107
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:51,520
Speaker 6:  But a beautiful leather binder. You know, it's like, I'll just end on this

1108
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:55,240
Speaker 6:  story. Like we, we have inte all these EDS and you realize like very

1109
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:59,160
Speaker 6:  little thought goes into EDS for anyone but YouTube, YouTube

1110
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:03,040
Speaker 6:  gold standard of EDS. Like the ed is the size of the

1111
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:07,000
Speaker 6:  video. All of the necessary controls and layouts

1112
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,440
Speaker 6:  of the ed are contained in the frame. Everyone knows what a YouTube video

1113
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:13,840
Speaker 6:  is. The play button conveys all the branding they need to, they don't send

1114
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:17,440
Speaker 6:  you the comments with it or you can't like, it's like,

1115
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:21,080
Speaker 6:  they're just like, here's our video. Like, we're so confident in ourselves

1116
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:24,360
Speaker 6:  as YouTube that like here's the video. And if people wanna read the comments

1117
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:27,320
Speaker 6:  on YouTube video, they damn well know to like click on the top and go to

1118
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:30,960
Speaker 6:  YouTube and read it. Instagram is like, here's 5,000 vertical

1119
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:31,400
Speaker 6:  pixels.

1120
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:32,440
Speaker 2:  It's so tall.

1121
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:36,240
Speaker 6:  Here is all of Instagram in an ed, right? TikTok

1122
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:39,800
Speaker 6:  is the same way. And Twitter, the embeds are getting bigger and you just

1123
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:43,560
Speaker 6:  see the platform. Companies don't care about the web. Like

1124
01:03:43,870 --> 01:03:47,800
Speaker 6:  I will make that accusation like that is not meaningful to them that

1125
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:51,640
Speaker 6:  their content travels outside of their walls. And when it does, they're like

1126
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:55,040
Speaker 6:  we have now colonized you in like the most direct way we can by

1127
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:58,360
Speaker 6:  effectively embedding our whole platform onto your page. Whereas YouTube,

1128
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:02,120
Speaker 6:  I think because it is like infrastructure of the web in some

1129
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:05,760
Speaker 6:  serious way, the embed is like respectful because

1130
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,480
Speaker 6:  YouTube knows that everyone will just go back to YouTube in a way that I

1131
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:13,320
Speaker 6:  think Instagram and TikTok and Twitter, like lack of the confidence of

1132
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,600
Speaker 6:  knowing that people will go back to

1133
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:18,200
Speaker 2:  Them. When you embed the verge on your website, you just get every story

1134
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,560
Speaker 2:  we've ever published. Oh

1135
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:22,720
Speaker 6:  Dude, we're gonna, art posts are gonna get in. Embedable I think that that'll

1136
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,200
Speaker 6:  be like one of the fun turns here in the

1137
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:27,920
Speaker 2:  End. I like it. So any, any product stuff to tease for people who are

1138
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,840
Speaker 2:  listening what's next? I don't even know the answer to this

1139
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,800
Speaker 6:  Question. So we we're gonna ship this version. Our product team keeps

1140
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,800
Speaker 6:  falling at verge 2.0 in my head. It's like verge 12, you know, whatever.

1141
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:40,680
Speaker 6:  We're gonna ship a 0.1 pretty soon. We are currently

1142
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:44,560
Speaker 6:  prioritizing what goes on 0.1. I've got one big idea, which

1143
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:47,720
Speaker 6:  I will tease a little bit. I think we now have the tools to do much better

1144
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:51,600
Speaker 6:  event coverage. So that's first on my list is how do we kind of remix

1145
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:55,240
Speaker 6:  what we've built here into a much better experience for an apple event or

1146
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,960
Speaker 6:  something like that. And then I really want to focus on some of this community

1147
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:01,920
Speaker 6:  stuff, but I really want the community to tell us what you would like so

1148
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:02,720
Speaker 6:  we can build the right stuff.

1149
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:06,520
