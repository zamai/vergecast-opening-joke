4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,980
Speaker 1:  Twitter. What that means, what would happen, what he is talking about. When

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,190
Speaker 1:  he talks about free speech, then Aussies had big soup on medicine tire AR

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,700
Speaker 1:  roadmap. We get into that. That's come up on the Vergecast. Now

00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,790
Speaker 1:  Hello, and welcome to the Vergecast flagship podcast. The

8
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,390
Speaker 1:  first amendment or the only podcast that reads

9
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,840
Speaker 1:  it, I've read it. I assure you that I've read the first

10
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,650
Speaker 1:  amendment and the associated case law. Look, I'm all about free

11
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:53,610
Speaker 1:  speech here. And if anyone says I'm not they're censoring me anyway,

12
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,130
Speaker 1:  I'm Neil. I'm your friend Alex grants here.

13
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,850
Speaker 5:  I'm actually buying another social media network. So I too can be a

14
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,350
Speaker 5:  champion of free speech.

15
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,130
Speaker 1:  So that's what you need. Market competition, Alex, Heath, this here.

16
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,940
Speaker 6:  Hi, I am your fire, your one desire.

17
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,950
Speaker 6:  And it's been a long week.

18
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,500
Speaker 1:  The last night I was talking to Alex. He goes, I think I almost passed out

19
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,530
Speaker 1:  today. And I was like, what happened? He's like, I forgot to breathe. Which

20
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,340
Speaker 1:  is like a real thing you said to me, he was like, I was typing

21
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,760
Speaker 1:  so fast. I forgot to breathe. Liz Lopatto was here.

22
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,750
Speaker 7:  I bring with me tidings of Elan, as I think long time listeners. Now

23
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,230
Speaker 1:  The winds of Ilan have brought Liz back to us. Once again, the

24
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,360
Speaker 7:  Winds are changing.

25
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,140
Speaker 1:  So we got to talk about it and buy it. I mean,

26
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,230
Speaker 1:  Intel's next generation. I don't mean that at all. What I mean is that Elon

27
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,170
Speaker 1:  Musk threatened to buy Twitter this week. He blew up our entire publishing

28
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,130
Speaker 1:  schedule. We had so many great stories this week and suddenly our whole

29
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,620
Speaker 1:  site yesterday, I looked at the site and the entire top of it was the alumni

30
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,550
Speaker 1:  stories. So if you will recall, I think I was not on the show the

31
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,020
Speaker 1:  week this happened, but you

32
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,620
Speaker 5:  Are not

33
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,410
Speaker 1:  Many of you were here that week. I was trapped on a plane, I believe.

34
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,250
Speaker 5:  And I were just dropping curse words the whole time you were gone.

35
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,260
Speaker 8:  Yeah. Dad's out everybody party.

36
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,160
Speaker 1:  Well, trust me, the curse words are coming free. Speech. You can't, you

37
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,190
Speaker 1:  can't shut me down. What's the FCC going to do? Half of my personality is

38
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,940
Speaker 1:  the movie pump up the volume scene where he drives around in the Jeep

39
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,810
Speaker 1:  Wrangler. And the FCC tries to chase him down. That's Easily

40
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,410
Speaker 1:  half of my personality. So Elan

41
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,250
Speaker 1:  bought 9% of Twitter. He was offered a board seat.

42
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,000
Speaker 1:  They thought he had were tricking him from what we gather into like having

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,930
Speaker 1:  a fiduciary duty to the best interest of the shareholders and

44
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,500
Speaker 1:  a lockup provision that said he couldn't buy more than like almost 15% of

45
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,590
Speaker 1:  the company. He declined this. He gets away from it ever and wonders. What's

46
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,280
Speaker 1:  he going to do? He filed, he sends it out another letter saying I

47
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,010
Speaker 1:  offered to buy the whole thing for Liz's favorite number 54,

48
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,230
Speaker 1:  20 a share is his favorite number all for favorite

49
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,980
Speaker 1:  number, chaos ensues. He did an interview at

50
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,650
Speaker 1:  Ted, which was horrible. We'll talk about that later with Addy. Cause it

51
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,490
Speaker 1:  was all about content moderation. What? Just start at the

52
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,150
Speaker 1:  start. Alex, walk me through like what this

53
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,630
Speaker 1:  offer is you reported right out of the Twitter, all hands

54
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,410
Speaker 1:  yesterday, you reported a little bit on what the board was thinking. What's

55
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,070
Speaker 1:  going on here.

56
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,880
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So Elan is offering about

57
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,630
Speaker 6:  of 43 ish billion dollar and I guess

58
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,080
Speaker 6:  cash. We don't really know. And I guess that's the Elan of all. This is

59
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,470
Speaker 6:  that he says funding is secured

60
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,400
Speaker 6:  TBD. We'll see what that is. He says he has the assets to

61
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,330
Speaker 6:  buy Twitter and take it private at a nice takeout premium,

62
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,930
Speaker 6:  which is higher than when he started buying shares towards the beginning

63
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,860
Speaker 6:  of the year. And he notified Twitter of this

64
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,700
Speaker 6:  one evening this week, the next morning made it public and an sec

65
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,820
Speaker 6:  filing and a tweet just saying like I made an

66
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,780
Speaker 6:  offer Twitter quickly responded and was like, we're going

67
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,440
Speaker 6:  to review this. Obviously they have to, Twitter is not a founder

68
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,380
Speaker 6:  controlled company like Facebook or snap or

69
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,980
Speaker 6:  Google. And they can't just have one person be like,

70
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,310
Speaker 6:  not when stuff like this happens. So they had to

71
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,970
Speaker 6:  respond. And then the chaos that is

72
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,690
Speaker 6:  Elan continued to ensue throughout the day. And I

73
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,880
Speaker 6:  forgot to breathe at some point after that,

74
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,520
Speaker 5:  You're too busy. You couldn't breathe. You had to blog.

75
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,940
Speaker 1:  And what are you doing with breathing? You don't breathe on my dime

76
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,810
Speaker 1:  Alex, on your own time, when you

77
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,650
Speaker 1:  taking breaths, there was actually a moment yesterday when Keith were boy,

78
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,130
Speaker 1:  who's like a high-end VC was

79
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,850
Speaker 1:  like the woke Twitter employees are going to see what's coming to them

80
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,600
Speaker 1:  one time, Elan threatened to fire all of the interns at Tesla because they

81
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,470
Speaker 1:  were waiting in line for coffee. And it was like, what?

82
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,340
Speaker 1:  Why are you turning heel so deeply, right? That just like buy

83
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,220
Speaker 1:  another coffee machine.

84
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,830
Speaker 6:  Well, it was really like, you know, the phrase like reality

85
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,310
Speaker 6:  is stranger than fiction or something like that. Like it was, it was focus

86
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:05,180
Speaker 6:  week for Twitter. So did employees had Monday off as a day of

87
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,870
Speaker 6:  rest. And that was when a lot of this started. And

88
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,170
Speaker 6:  then for the week they were supposed to take minimal meetings and be heads

89
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:16,130
Speaker 6:  down on projects. And the CEO then scheduled

90
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:16,880
Speaker 6:  an emergency all

91
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,450
Speaker 6:  hands.

92
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,440
Speaker 6:  Pretty interesting. And you know, had some Backstreet

93
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,310
Speaker 6:  boys playing. So yeah, it was a, it was the CFO's birthday, I think

94
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,210
Speaker 6:  when Elan made the bid as well. So you just,

95
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,620
Speaker 6:  you can't write this stuff.

96
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,980
Speaker 1:  The Backstreet boys line by the way is real. They open the meeting by playing

97
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,970
Speaker 1:  Backstreet boys, which is perfect. Like someone had to choose

98
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,420
Speaker 1:  like that's you have to make you don't just like hit the button in zoom.

99
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,990
Speaker 1:  That's like play some music you like now let's go with Backstreet. Yeah.

100
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,860
Speaker 6:  The first song was I say a little prayer and then they

101
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,220
Speaker 6:  jumped into, I want it that way.

102
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,060
Speaker 1:  Amazing.

103
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,870
Speaker 7:  I think we've all been saying little prayers ever since this, this offer

104
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,040
Speaker 7:  became public. Yeah.

105
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,850
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So Liz, you are a noted Elan watcher. I believe you described

106
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,600
Speaker 1:  yourself as a sicko yesterday. That might've been the exact phrase you

107
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,720
Speaker 1:  used to walk us through the Ilan of this all.

108
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,530
Speaker 7:  Okay. Well I just want to say like, although he's got Morgan Stanley

109
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:19,010
Speaker 7:  advising him, he says that funding is contingent on

110
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,970
Speaker 7:  winning. And then if this seems familiar, it's because he doesn't have

111
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,900
Speaker 7:  funding lined up. And like during his Ted talk, he was like,

112
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,500
Speaker 7:  well, I don't, I don't, I could buy Twitter, but I don't want to which who

113
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,770
Speaker 7:  could blame him because he'd have to sell a bunch of Tesla shares and that

114
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,550
Speaker 7:  would make the Tesla people very unhappy. So the funding is

115
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,390
Speaker 7:  TBD. And if this were anybody else, I would say, this is not a

116
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,110
Speaker 7:  serious offer because serious offers have funding lined

117
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,010
Speaker 7:  up. But in Elan's case, it's impossible to tell what serious and

118
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,970
Speaker 7:  what some kind of joke, which is like, you know, Matt Levine has suggested

119
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,960
Speaker 7:  Twitter, come back to him with another price, which is the

120
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,330
Speaker 7:  other fund, internet number $69 a

121
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:03,140
Speaker 7:  share, Which, you know what I

122
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,920
Speaker 7:  like, I like, I like how he was thinking here, but you know, if you, if you

123
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,760
Speaker 7:  consider what he's doing, I got to say, like, I kind of feel

124
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,120
Speaker 7:  like he's just fucking with Twitter because the share price

125
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,510
Speaker 7:  is it, you know, it's, it's relatively low compared to where Twitter has

126
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,380
Speaker 7:  been trading since like last year. Like I think it was in the

127
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,800
Speaker 7:  sixties in October and then the seventies, like a year

128
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,580
Speaker 7:  ago. So like relatively recently, the, the share price was

129
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,570
Speaker 7:  trading at more than a lot more than what he's offering. Well, the

130
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,330
Speaker 7:  other thing that I noticed about shares because the secret of shares is like,

131
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,780
Speaker 7:  they're just like feelings. Like this is just people putting money on like

132
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,770
Speaker 7:  their feelings. That's that's all the market is now. You're a trader.

133
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:46,580
Speaker 7:  I noticed that the shares were trading well

134
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,450
Speaker 7:  below where the offer was

135
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:53,300
Speaker 7:  all of yesterday, which means that the market doesn't believe it's real.

136
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,190
Speaker 7:  Now, if the market did believe it's real, it would be trading at the same

137
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,060
Speaker 7:  price or around the price of the offer. And if they thought there was going

138
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,780
Speaker 7:  to be somebody else jumping in, like for instance, Disney, they would be

139
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,560
Speaker 7:  trading above the offer. So you can look at that and you can say,

140
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,520
Speaker 7:  oh, these people are familiar with Elon Musk. They're aware that sometimes

141
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,820
Speaker 7:  when he says he was taking a company private, he's just

142
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,860
Speaker 7:  kidding.

143
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,630
Speaker 1:  Let's we gotta talk about that specific line of Elon in a minute.

144
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,440
Speaker 1:  But real quickly is I think most people are vaguely

145
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,130
Speaker 1:  aware that you can offer to buy a company, but there's like a lot of steps

146
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,760
Speaker 1:  before the company is actually yours. So what's the process here that Elon

147
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,600
Speaker 1:  would have to go through.

148
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,560
Speaker 7:  So I, the first, this is a hostile bid. So that's that in and of itself

149
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,550
Speaker 7:  is unusual. Ordinarily one works with companies management to

150
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:45,510
Speaker 7:  like come together with a thing that will be acceptable to

151
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,480
Speaker 7:  major shareholders. And this is not what's happening here. This is Ilan is

152
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,080
Speaker 7:  like, I got a bid. So Twitter has to think about it. They have like a whole

153
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,040
Speaker 7:  fiduciary duty. The board is going to be thinking about it, but I, if

154
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,370
Speaker 7:  I'm Ilan right now, I'm out here pressuring shareholders to pressure the

155
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,330
Speaker 7:  board. So I'm calling them. I'm saying things like in that script that we

156
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,450
Speaker 7:  all saw that was filed with the sec where it's like, this is my best and

157
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,900
Speaker 7:  final offer. And I, you know what, I'm going to sell all my

158
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,740
Speaker 7:  shares if it doesn't work, which in Elan's case is like a little bit like,

159
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,550
Speaker 7:  Hmm, okay, this is, this is hard ball. This is like some Carl Icahn shit

160
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,940
Speaker 7:  we got going on here. And he loved because he created a premium by getting

161
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,970
Speaker 7:  into the stock, by having his ownership announced, which is the sort of thing

162
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,940
Speaker 7:  that you associate actually with corporate Raiders. Like that's also what

163
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,840
Speaker 7:  happens with Carl Icahn gets into a stock. So Twitter's board has to think

164
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,620
Speaker 7:  this through, like, just because I'm a, I'm a lady who is like, maybe

165
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,310
Speaker 7:  not particularly privy to this stuff. I think it's going to be

166
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:42,240
Speaker 7:  like, I don't think that the board is going to say yes to

167
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,930
Speaker 7:  this. Just speaking as somebody who doesn't know anybody on the board or

168
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,630
Speaker 7:  doesn't have any connections to the board. I feel like if I were on the board,

169
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:52,530
Speaker 7:  I'd be like, no, but what's interesting. Here is now the company is

170
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,230
Speaker 7:  in place. So there could potentially be another bidder. The market doesn't

171
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:59,220
Speaker 7:  totally believe it. But if I'm a tech company and I ever wanted to acquire

172
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,220
Speaker 7:  a Twitter, like now's the moment. Because one of the things that the board

173
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,970
Speaker 7:  can do is come back with somebody else's better offer and say, sorry, Elan.

174
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,840
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So Alex, you were tracking a little bit of this yesterday.

175
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,230
Speaker 1:  Twitter's management and board is kind of an interesting spot, right? Jack

176
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,500
Speaker 1:  Dorsey left. He basically said my hand selected

177
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,190
Speaker 1:  successors progra wall as CEO and my hand selected

178
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,530
Speaker 1:  chairman of the board is this guy, Brett Taylor. And he's like, these are

179
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:26,490
Speaker 1:  my guys. I picked him. I love him. They're Jack skies. They were, I,

180
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,390
Speaker 1:  you can't like if someone came to your job and was like,

181
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,780
Speaker 1:  we think you've been doing a really bad job, so we're just gonna take it

182
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,440
Speaker 1:  from here. Like it's, I don't think it's instinctual for you to be like,

183
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,310
Speaker 1:  I agree with you. And I have trapping accepted this job. I

184
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,400
Speaker 1:  will in fact recede into the distance and let you destroy whatever it is.

185
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,940
Speaker 1:  I was supposed to be in charge of like, especially for a young

186
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,780
Speaker 1:  CEO who has no name, otherwise, like, that's just

187
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:55,000
Speaker 1:  like, you're done, right? Like you're, you might as well just ride off into

188
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,870
Speaker 1:  the sunset, like your career kind of stops there. So

189
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,580
Speaker 1:  what were you hearing yesterday, Alex?

190
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,480
Speaker 6:  Well, I think every, I mean, obviously I think Liz is right. The

191
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,170
Speaker 6:  board doesn't want to do this. I think that was the tone of the all hands

192
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,130
Speaker 6:  with employees was Prague was, you know, I think employees

193
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,740
Speaker 6:  were because Prague and the leadership had not

194
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,670
Speaker 6:  directly addressed Ilan besides

195
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,570
Speaker 6:  Pirog tweeting when he decided not to join the board and

196
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:26,530
Speaker 6:  saying distractions are ahead. Foreboding kind of what was to come employees

197
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,340
Speaker 6:  were expecting. I think at this emergency all hands to kind of get some more

198
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,270
Speaker 6:  clarity about where the company was leaning, what the timeline was going

199
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,570
Speaker 6:  to look like here, because this could be a protracted messy thing, especially

200
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,440
Speaker 6:  if they have to run an official bidding process. And these large

201
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,860
Speaker 6:  companies take time to reviews the review of these deals.

202
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,070
Speaker 6:  So, you know, that's not really what happened. And Pirog was like, look for

203
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:51,880
Speaker 6:  legal reasons. I can't really say, but I can just say that we're

204
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,810
Speaker 6:  following a rigorous process. Yada, yada, everything was obviously very

205
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,870
Speaker 6:  lawyered. They knew it was going to leak like almost in real

206
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:02,830
Speaker 6:  time. It wasn't quite in real time, but we got ours up like

207
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,760
Speaker 6:  right when it ended. So our, our story on it. So yeah,

208
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,390
Speaker 6:  it was, I would say there was a sense of resistance,

209
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,990
Speaker 6:  but from Pirog he said something about how, you know, we're not going to

210
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,890
Speaker 6:  be held hostage. And, you know, basically saying that

211
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:21,130
Speaker 6:  like it's too early to speculate about what it would look like if we were

212
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,790
Speaker 6:  taken private, because there's big implications for employees in that, you

213
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,880
Speaker 6:  know, if that happens, because what happens to their stock

214
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,510
Speaker 6:  options, there were questions about layoffs, which is something I was actually

215
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,170
Speaker 6:  hearing before this meeting was the moment Elon announced his interest. I

216
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:38,650
Speaker 6:  had like three Twitter employees to be like, there's going to be layoffs.

217
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,790
Speaker 1:  Like, absolutely.

218
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,690
Speaker 6:  Like Twitter is fairly bloated relative to

219
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,440
Speaker 6:  the money it makes and it's tech peers. So those are the

220
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,920
Speaker 6:  questions on people's minds, which to me says, people think that this is,

221
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,640
Speaker 6:  you know, the rank and file thinks this is probably happening no matter what,

222
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,940
Speaker 6:  at least like there's going to be a messy, maybe bad outcome for

223
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,930
Speaker 6:  them from this. And so in that way, you know, there's a,

224
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,890
Speaker 6:  maybe a fear that management at Twitter has kind of lost faith. You

225
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:09,340
Speaker 6:  know, that the employees have lost faith in them to a degree, a little bit.

226
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,130
Speaker 6:  One was like, are we just going to be letting any billionaire who wants a

227
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:15,280
Speaker 6:  board seat? Give them a board seat. Are we going to just like, do this for

228
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,650
Speaker 6:  everyone now who asks

229
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,210
Speaker 5:  They got enough money, right.

230
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:23,050
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And it's an interesting time for Elan to be doing this because Jack

231
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:26,950
Speaker 6:  is on the board for like another month or so before the next board votes

232
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,880
Speaker 6:  on the new board seats. And so, I don't know, you know, my favorite conspiracy

233
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,640
Speaker 6:  theory here is that Jack and Ilan are aligned on this. And this is Jack

234
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,590
Speaker 6:  Sweet revenge on Elliot management, which was the last active

235
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:42,550
Speaker 6:  investor that came into Twitter and really kind

236
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:46,480
Speaker 6:  of led to Jack stepping aside and naming Pirog last November.

237
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,330
Speaker 1:  Walk us through that. There's a lot of detail to explore there

238
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:52,760
Speaker 7:  Before you walk us through it. We need to have the succession theme play

239
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,150
Speaker 7:  because this is like very like, this is a very

240
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:59,090
Speaker 7:  succession theme moment here.

241
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:03,020
Speaker 6:  Oh my God. I had a very senior former Twitter person be like text me right

242
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,890
Speaker 6:  before Elan walked out on stage at Ted and be like, I have money on Jack

243
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,430
Speaker 6:  walking out with him on stage attack, which is like,

244
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,310
Speaker 6:  yeah, that's, that's better than whatever the next

245
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:16,520
Speaker 5:  Jack wanted to take the company private awhile ago. Didn't he?

246
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,120
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So I had done some reporting a couple of years ago that, you know,

247
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,050
Speaker 6:  the last time Twitter ran a formal sales process was

248
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:27,620
Speaker 6:  around 2016. And that was when Salesforce and Disney were the two kind of

249
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,610
Speaker 6:  lead suitors and Bob Iger and mark Benioff have talked publicly about

250
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,880
Speaker 6:  that. There were two other players who didn't get as far apple and

251
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,690
Speaker 6:  Google that were looking at IQ at apple and Sundar at Google.

252
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,440
Speaker 6:  And there were also some offers informally to take the company

253
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,560
Speaker 6:  private at the time. And this was when Twitter's valuation was like 10 billion.

254
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,640
Speaker 6:  And it was just really, almost struggling more than it has been

255
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,270
Speaker 6:  since, which is like hard to think about. So I had heard from

256
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:56,870
Speaker 6:  someone kind of directly involved in those talks that Jack was in favor of

257
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,960
Speaker 6:  taking the company private at that time. And it makes sense because Twitter

258
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,740
Speaker 6:  has just, when you have these quarterly expectations in the

259
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,700
Speaker 6:  market and your comp to Facebook, which has just been this unstoppable

260
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,450
Speaker 6:  growth juggernaut for over a decade and even like

261
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:15,410
Speaker 6:  snap snap is added like a hundred more, a hundred million more users than

262
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,310
Speaker 6:  Twitter. And it's like four years younger as a company and been public

263
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:23,120
Speaker 6:  way less. So Twitter is just really struggled relative to its

264
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,020
Speaker 6:  peer set. And it could probably use the insulation that going private

265
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,890
Speaker 6:  would provide it right where like they can actually go heads down and focus

266
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:34,850
Speaker 6:  on just not these near term quarterly benchmarks they need to meet,

267
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,810
Speaker 6:  but like really, really, you know, reinvent the product and Jack and

268
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:42,560
Speaker 6:  Elan saw eye to eye on that. You know, they both talk about open

269
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,560
Speaker 6:  sourcing the algorithm, which God we got to get into that because that makes

270
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,400
Speaker 6:  absolutely no sense. None, you know, opening up the algorithms cause that'll

271
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,950
Speaker 6:  solve everything and, you know, crypto

272
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,730
Speaker 6:  decentralization putting, making it a protocol again, going back to the

273
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,450
Speaker 6:  Tweety days when like all these clients were sat on top of

274
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:03,440
Speaker 6:  Twitter and invented, you know, the best parts of Twitter. And I

275
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,010
Speaker 6:  could see there's an argument to be made that Jack maybe wants this in the

276
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:10,340
Speaker 6:  background. And the fact that Elon is doing this while Jack is still on the

277
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:14,180
Speaker 6:  board and still has about 2%. It's like the timing of that. Very interesting.

278
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,750
Speaker 1:  So Jack had a tweet a couple of weeks ago now where he was

279
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,140
Speaker 1:  like, I now realize that centralizing all internet

280
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,560
Speaker 1:  services was a mistake and I am to blame. And then someone was like, well

281
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,110
Speaker 1:  fix it. He was like, I'm working on it. And I've just been thinking about

282
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,680
Speaker 1:  that, that little interaction in this context a lot, because

283
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,670
Speaker 1:  he, Twitter has this program called blue sky, which

284
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:38,090
Speaker 1:  has been moving in an absolutely glacial pace, which is

285
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:42,020
Speaker 1:  designed to decentralize Twitter and turn it into a protocol. When I

286
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,860
Speaker 1:  say a glacial pace, I mean every six months, they're like, we've

287
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:49,800
Speaker 1:  hired one more person. We're up to four.

288
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,950
Speaker 6:  They recently announced. So it's actually a separate legal entity. It's like

289
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,700
Speaker 6:  a nonprofit that Twitter funds, they're not the only funder and Jack is on

290
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,610
Speaker 6:  the board of blue sky. And he's about to leave the board of Twitter and he

291
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,280
Speaker 6:  just joined blue sky interesting note, but continuing the line.

292
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,970
Speaker 1:  Yeah. It just put the it's the heaven, you know, I feel about vaporware.

293
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,120
Speaker 1:  You can tell me you're going to do shit all day long. Right? You have to

294
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,930
Speaker 1:  do it. And they've, they've not shipped a single line of code. They've

295
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,750
Speaker 1:  shipped a white paper and a bunch of press releases about people they've

296
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,410
Speaker 1:  hired.

297
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:19,830
Speaker 7:  Well, you know, Jack is very into crypto, so that's like kind of standard

298
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,700
Speaker 7:  in that world. Although in fairness, I should say he's a

299
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,600
Speaker 7:  Bitcoin maxi and not into crypto per se so much as he's just

300
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,620
Speaker 7:  into Bitcoin.

301
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,610
Speaker 1:  Great. He's the one who's beefing with Chris Dixon about Andreessen Horowitz

302
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:36,450
Speaker 1:  being just like another, like a VC front for web three. And

303
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:40,050
Speaker 1:  he's like, Bitcoin is the alpha and the omega at web three is just another

304
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,750
Speaker 1:  way for VCs Tony internet. Like that's Jack very

305
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,740
Speaker 1:  publicly beefing with the people who are funding web three.

306
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,730
Speaker 1:  However you wanted to find next to that is Ilan who, who just

307
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,150
Speaker 1:  loves Twitter. Like the man just loves Twitter. Lizzie mentioned Matt Levine

308
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,600
Speaker 1:  earlier in it. He's a columnist for Bloomberg

309
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,200
Speaker 1:  in one of his columns, I think earlier last week, maybe he was

310
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,660
Speaker 1:  like, if you're really rich and you play a video game all the time, you're

311
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,650
Speaker 1:  going to have ideas about the video game and that is Ilan and Twitter,

312
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:11,460
Speaker 1:  right? Like it's a video game that he constantly plays and stuff like

313
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,700
Speaker 1:  open up the algorithm. Like that's the sort of idea you might have about

314
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,630
Speaker 1:  it. Like I have a million ideas on how to fix Madden NFL. Like I, every

315
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,530
Speaker 1:  day I can just generate a list and there's like, what I think should happen

316
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:26,430
Speaker 1:  and reality of that game and how it is architected. And

317
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:30,240
Speaker 1:  so if you think, you know, I can just buy it and open source Twitter or buy

318
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,300
Speaker 1:  it and turn it into a protocol. The technical effort to do

319
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,870
Speaker 1:  that is extraordinarily high. The company is

320
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:40,770
Speaker 1:  already trying to do some of that stuff and hasn't done any of it. And all

321
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,350
Speaker 1:  the employees are pissed off and thinking about leaving or we're worried

322
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:47,220
Speaker 1:  about being laid off. Like, I don't know how you go from here to there. And

323
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,930
Speaker 1:  Ilan hasn't really laid it out.

324
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:52,110
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I mean, there was a pretty senior Twitter person who I saw a tweet

325
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:56,100
Speaker 6:  in response to someone saying like, what will you do if Elan takes over?

326
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,440
Speaker 6:  And is I, and she was like, well, you know, I hope he likes working at a

327
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,250
Speaker 6:  company with no employees. Like she was like the head of like machine

328
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,520
Speaker 6:  learning or something. So yeah, open sourcing the algorithm. Can we talk

329
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,670
Speaker 6:  about this? Because you know, I actually, I just did a story a couple of

330
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:12,570
Speaker 6:  weeks ago about Facebook. It took them six months to try to figure

331
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:16,350
Speaker 6:  out what went wrong with the newsfeed algorithm. This is the people

332
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:20,340
Speaker 6:  who directly work on the newsfeed literally did not

333
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,150
Speaker 6:  know what broke for months. And they are still dissecting

334
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,750
Speaker 6:  it. Like I've heard from people who work on these kinds of algorithms that

335
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,200
Speaker 6:  these social media companies, they don't really know how they

336
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,860
Speaker 6:  work fully. It's all, it's like a Pandora's box that once you

337
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,790
Speaker 6:  open these things have millions of signals. And the idea that

338
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:42,300
Speaker 6:  like, it's this one algorithm that everyone can just like look at and

339
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,750
Speaker 6:  dissect and know all of its inputs and

340
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,300
Speaker 6:  outputs. The whole point of this is that it's different for every single

341
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,170
Speaker 6:  person. These algorithms are really just like a reflection of like

342
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:57,160
Speaker 6:  your most carnal desires. Like they

343
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,700
Speaker 6:  are a distorted mirror of you and your worst impulses.

344
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,540
Speaker 5:  Well, a lot of them, but I mean, it's, Twitter's though like Twitter. I always

345
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,160
Speaker 5:  envisioned as having the most

346
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,930
Speaker 5:  simplistic

347
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:11,050
Speaker 9:  Envision about Twitter

348
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:11,620
Speaker 6:  Because

349
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,400
Speaker 5:  Like, this is not Tik talk that like

350
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,120
Speaker 5:  knows I like skiing before I did. This is like pretty

351
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,930
Speaker 5:  simple

352
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:23,710
Speaker 6:  As someone who woke up this morning and was seeing tweets from 17 hours ago

353
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,740
Speaker 6:  at the top of my feet and had to switch to chronological. Cause I was like,

354
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,700
Speaker 6:  I saw this yesterday and have that experience on a daily basis. You're

355
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,150
Speaker 6:  right. That's what our algorithm is. Not really that good at mind reading,

356
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:37,390
Speaker 6:  but my point is just that the algorithm is different for every single

357
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:41,380
Speaker 6:  person. And I think we're fooling ourselves to say that like millions

358
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,310
Speaker 6:  of people care or want to know the innards of like the

359
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:48,190
Speaker 6:  feed that is giving them information.

360
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:52,120
Speaker 5:  I don't think millions, but one of these algorithms being open source

361
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,050
Speaker 5:  is a fascinating thing because we don't really have one now to my

362
00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:00,040
Speaker 5:  knowledge and, and, and having those researchers and those people

363
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,310
Speaker 5:  in the open source community, having access and starting to tweak with these

364
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:07,090
Speaker 5:  things and deal with them is really interesting. I

365
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:10,900
Speaker 5:  think for Twitter itself, it makes zero sense and as

366
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,680
Speaker 5:  super stupid, but like, I think 90% of Twitter's business

367
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,400
Speaker 5:  is kind of stupid. Like it's not a company that's making a lot of

368
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,090
Speaker 5:  money. It's not a company that's building subscribers, everything about this.

369
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,690
Speaker 5:  It's just like a billionaire kind of shit posting his

370
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:29,530
Speaker 5:  way into notoriety with a company that he can afford to

371
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,400
Speaker 5:  do it with.

372
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,970
Speaker 7:  I also don't know that like the algorithm is the problem with

373
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:37,750
Speaker 7:  Twitter. Like I just, I just want to be super real

374
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,710
Speaker 7:  about like what Twitter is. It's like an all

375
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:45,520
Speaker 7:  versus all hostiles zone where

376
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,940
Speaker 7:  like, you know, roving gangs of people

377
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,810
Speaker 7:  form and like it.

378
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:56,710
Speaker 7:  So I'm going to compare it to four Chan in a very limited way, which

379
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,880
Speaker 7:  is that it is,

380
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,250
Speaker 5:  This is

381
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,930
Speaker 7:  Getting good. It is a nexus of internet culture from which a lot of internet

382
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:05,650
Speaker 7:  culture comes, but it is also a very hostile

383
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,830
Speaker 7:  environment. And now the mechanics of it work differently from four Chan,

384
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,710
Speaker 7:  like in ways that are like maybe not worth discussing right at this very

385
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:15,640
Speaker 7:  moment. But in terms of like users, it's a relatively

386
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,360
Speaker 7:  small base compared to like most of the other social

387
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,870
Speaker 7:  media platforms, but it has this like outsized

388
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:26,740
Speaker 7:  hold on the public's imagination, a of all, because every

389
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,610
Speaker 7:  journalist is like addled by Twitter. Cause we're all there. Cause

390
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:34,210
Speaker 7:  that's like what we do instead of like RSS feeds

391
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:38,020
Speaker 7:  because Google reader doesn't exist anymore. So Google, thank

392
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,400
Speaker 7:  you. This is your fault.

393
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,070
Speaker 1:  RSS feeds. I, it would not be the virtuous. If I didn't remind that RSS feed

394
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:46,580
Speaker 1:  still exist, there are many independent RSS readers over there and I'm counting

395
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,240
Speaker 1:  on Google to be the sole shepherd or the open internet was always a mistake.

396
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,580
Speaker 1:  That's it? Just my little digression, the act.

397
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,360
Speaker 7:  So there's that. But also like we have these 24 hour cable

398
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,200
Speaker 7:  news networks that like need to like put stuff on

399
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,470
Speaker 7:  television. And so what do they do? They open up Twitter, they read tweets

400
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,120
Speaker 7:  out loud and like, that's like a segment.

401
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,570
Speaker 1:  And as somebody who has a cable news contract, I feel comfortable

402
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:12,470
Speaker 1:  saying the majority of mainstream cable news is a podcast to people

403
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:16,250
Speaker 1:  reading tweets. And then like, I'm not saying that's not

404
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,120
Speaker 1:  our podcast. Like it's not like the harshest criticism in the world.

405
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,760
Speaker 1:  Like we're talking about one guy who tweets a lot. We've been doing it for

406
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,390
Speaker 1:  26 minutes. So like maybe that's all news now.

407
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:30,290
Speaker 1:  But the point about like what Twitter is, whether it has a

408
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:33,830
Speaker 1:  ranking algorithm or not, the problem is actually expressed

409
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:37,700
Speaker 1:  in whether the ranking algorithm for Twitter is it's product or

410
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,630
Speaker 1:  not. Facebook's product is a ranking algorithm. Take talks.

411
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:45,230
Speaker 1:  Product is a ranking algorithm, right? Google's product

412
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,620
Speaker 1:  is the world's most successful ranking algorithm. You

413
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,460
Speaker 1:  express some interest to one of these platforms and they

414
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,910
Speaker 1:  have a huge data set of all the other people. YouTube has a huge data set

415
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:58,760
Speaker 1:  of all the other people have contributed content and then they show it to

416
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,540
Speaker 1:  you, Twitter, you log in as a new user and it's like, the

417
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,810
Speaker 1:  worst shit in the world is going to immediately start happening to you. And

418
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:09,740
Speaker 1:  maybe you will find NBA Twitter, or maybe you will distract

419
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,700
Speaker 1:  yourself with media, Twitter. Like maybe you will find some pocket of

420
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,330
Speaker 1:  film Twitter. That's great. But at any moment, as Liz

421
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:21,110
Speaker 1:  said, that angriest hoards of people might find you or the

422
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:25,070
Speaker 1:  worst possible thing that could happen to you, your tweet will go viral and

423
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,060
Speaker 1:  like Fox news will write about you. Like the worst possible

424
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,000
Speaker 1:  things could happen to you at any moment. On the Twitter platform,

425
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,990
Speaker 6:  I had a tweet go viral about Ilan and the day of

426
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:39,380
Speaker 6:  the week of focus and the day of arrest, then the timing of it all. And it

427
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,340
Speaker 6:  was just, it was that persona. It was just like his bot

428
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:47,330
Speaker 6:  farms and his like, you know, people calling me an idiot and all

429
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,870
Speaker 6:  these things saying, I don't understand things. Like I got like

430
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:54,530
Speaker 6:  unsolicited, like hate mail. So it's

431
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:58,220
Speaker 6:  like just for a tweet. And that was because it was about Elan, the guy trying

432
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,000
Speaker 6:  to take Twitter, we should know like Elon has a like massive

433
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,690
Speaker 6:  bot army that follows him on Twitter and amplifies and it

434
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:09,170
Speaker 6:  attacks his critics. And he said that he wants to get rid of bots. But

435
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:13,130
Speaker 6:  like, it's just very ironic to me that that's the

436
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:16,460
Speaker 6:  case that like this, this one individual has that

437
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,970
Speaker 5:  Well, like I think a lot of people fail to understand that

438
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:23,840
Speaker 5:  Ilan success at this point that his current success is

439
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,770
Speaker 5:  kind of based on Twitter and this like this fandom he's

440
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:31,760
Speaker 5:  created around himself that centralized on Twitter. Right.

441
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,720
Speaker 1:  I think Elan might feel that way. And I think we might feel that way. I'm

442
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,470
Speaker 1:  not entirely like, I don't know the conversion rate between

443
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:43,230
Speaker 1:  having a bot army and lots of followers on Twitter to Tesla sales.

444
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:47,160
Speaker 1:  Right. And Tessa has apparently like inelastic demand. Like you can price

445
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,400
Speaker 1:  a Tesla at any number or produce any number of Teslas and all of them will

446
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,090
Speaker 1:  sell. Like they can't, every Tesla they make at any price will sell out.

447
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,520
Speaker 1:  Right. What does that have to do with the Twitter army?

448
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,360
Speaker 7:  I'm like dying here because like I have been covering Elon

449
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,080
Speaker 7:  Musk for a very long time and like, yeah, like

450
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,680
Speaker 7:  welcome to tweeting about Elon Musk. Like those aren't all bots. Like some

451
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,610
Speaker 7:  of those are just people who can't spell very well. You discover

452
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:15,510
Speaker 7:  if you reply to them. So Tesla is the original meme stock.

453
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,960
Speaker 7:  And like one of the things that was going on with Tesla

454
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,757
Speaker 7:  shares, you know, in 20 16, 20 17, 20 18

455
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,760
Speaker 7:  is like Elon Musk can make the shares go up by tweeting positive things about

456
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,450
Speaker 7:  Tesla. And like he's been disclosed and their company filings as being like

457
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:33,870
Speaker 7:  a source of legitimate information, like his Twitter account. Isn't there

458
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:37,680
Speaker 7:  a legitimate source of information about the stock. I take your point. And

459
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,490
Speaker 7:  you lie about like, being a little cautious about wanting to say that like

460
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:45,180
Speaker 7:  he's built his army on Twitter, but like I kind of think he has. And like

461
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:48,870
Speaker 7:  he is maybe the most important financial influencer currently

462
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:52,650
Speaker 7:  going, like he can send cryptocurrency up and down just by tweeting about

463
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:56,280
Speaker 7:  it, you know? Yeah. There was the brief period where he, Tesla was accepting

464
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,490
Speaker 7:  Bitcoin and that made Bitcoin go up. And then Tesla like stopped accepting

465
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:03,030
Speaker 7:  Bitcoin and Bitcoin went down and like he used tweeted about dose and dose

466
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:06,450
Speaker 7:  has gone up. So I do think that there's something very real here and it's

467
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:10,380
Speaker 7:  because so many finance people are on Twitter. Like I don't, you

468
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,650
Speaker 7:  gotta, you gotta, you gotta want to be on finance Twitter. I'll be real with

469
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,610
Speaker 7:  you. Slotted penny stock guys that hate you. But like, there is a very real

470
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:21,510
Speaker 7:  community like tweets show up on the Bloomberg terminal. And so that's

471
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,900
Speaker 7:  another reason why Twitter is so powerful. Like all of these communities,

472
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,650
Speaker 7:  like it's just, it's like the most hardcore people in any

473
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:32,490
Speaker 7:  given community are all on Twitter together. And so Elon Musk like

474
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,970
Speaker 7:  Twitter is really a source of power for him. Because

475
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:39,300
Speaker 7:  again, he can, he can really move real world

476
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,260
Speaker 7:  stocks by, by tweeting about them. And like, if you remember the game

477
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,160
Speaker 7:  stop thing in January, 2020, there are a bunch of people who

478
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,090
Speaker 7:  made a lot of money, but realizing that an Elon Musk tweet was the top and

479
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,340
Speaker 7:  immediately selling as soon as they saw it, you

480
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,590
Speaker 7:  know,

481
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:58,950
Speaker 1:  I'm not saying it's, I'm not saying it's zero. I'm saying it's not a hundred.

482
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:02,910
Speaker 1:  And we don't, there's no way of knowing, right? Like what is

483
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:06,870
Speaker 1:  the conversion rate between an Ilan tweet and people mind, like,

484
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:10,410
Speaker 1:  I don't know, that would be an amazing PhD thesis. Someone should do it.

485
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:13,830
Speaker 1:  And then we'll write about it. Like, I would love to know that information

486
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,290
Speaker 7:  If you're an economist,

487
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:19,950
Speaker 1:  By the way, by throwing the game software, this reminds me this, the next

488
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,170
Speaker 1:  hour is just gonna be talking about tweets that went viral and how bad it

489
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:26,100
Speaker 1:  was. Like I did like the most in the light

490
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,040
Speaker 1:  tweet during the whole GameStop fiasco and Robin hood was

491
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,970
Speaker 1:  stopping sales. And I was like, here's a screenshot of the

492
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:35,910
Speaker 1:  terms of service. Like this is what happens when everyone just hits agree

493
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:39,810
Speaker 1:  without reading it. And then like the hordes descended on me that I was

494
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:42,910
Speaker 1:  not being sympathetic to the, to the retail investor. And I was like, no,

495
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:46,420
Speaker 1:  I'm just in my bag. Like, this is what I talked about. Like every day is

496
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,900
Speaker 1:  terms of service agreements. Like I had nothing to

497
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,770
Speaker 1:  say, anyhow, my broader

498
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:56,830
Speaker 1:  point is like, Elon loves the service. When Addy comes on, we're going to

499
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,890
Speaker 1:  talk about whether it's a town square or any of that

500
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:03,640
Speaker 1:  noise. But the core of the problem, like we keep kind of

501
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,570
Speaker 1:  dancing around. It was just say it out loud. Twitter needs to grow in order

502
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:11,500
Speaker 1:  to grow, it needs to be much more consumer friendly. It needs

503
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,490
Speaker 1:  to be a much friendlier environment to just sign up for it. You want to

504
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:19,270
Speaker 1:  get a hundred million users, which is what we're all supposed to do in his

505
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:23,110
Speaker 1:  tenure. As CEO, you cannot, you cannot

506
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:26,410
Speaker 1:  have this experience with Twitter for initiate a hundred million new people

507
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:29,060
Speaker 1:  who want to use your service every day. That's not how tic Tucker that's

508
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,620
Speaker 1:  how YouTube grow. That's how snap is growing. Those are friendly,

509
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,490
Speaker 1:  meaningfully safer environments than Twitter. But then the thing that

510
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:40,420
Speaker 1:  makes Twitter valuable is just like the state of nature

511
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:44,320
Speaker 1:  for nerds, right? We're like life is bloody and short

512
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,100
Speaker 1:  on Twitter, but if you're a nerd, it's where you want to be. Right. And like,

513
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,730
Speaker 1:  I don't like fucking, can you

514
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:55,630
Speaker 1:  sell nature red in tooth and claw to a hundred million more people? Like,

515
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,790
Speaker 1:  I don't know the answer to that question.

516
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,190
Speaker 5:  I don't think we can because people keep comparing Twitter

517
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:05,080
Speaker 5:  to Facebook or to snap or whatever.

518
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,500
Speaker 5:  But really its main comparison is tumbler.

519
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,490
Speaker 5:  Like it's a place, it's a place it's like developing fans and

520
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:16,180
Speaker 5:  fandoms. And whether that's an Elan fandom or a TV show

521
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:20,080
Speaker 5:  fandom or movies, or you know, tech, a lot of us are in

522
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,860
Speaker 5:  that fandom. It, it it's building like a fandom. It's building like a community

523
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,730
Speaker 5:  of like weirdos who want to talk about this stuff. Facebook is

524
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:31,630
Speaker 5:  not super great at that. Snap is not super great at

525
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:35,440
Speaker 5:  that. Tumblr was I guess, okay. At it,

526
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,710
Speaker 5:  Twitter is really good at it. And that's like, but that's also like a small

527
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:42,280
Speaker 5:  market. Those weird obsessives. I say that as one, those weird

528
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,270
Speaker 5:  obsessives, like that's a small group of people. I don't think Twitter,

529
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:49,840
Speaker 5:  like, unless it fundamentally changes its approach and how it

530
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,830
Speaker 5:  operates. It's never going to move out of that. And I don't think it

531
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,850
Speaker 5:  necessarily

532
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:57,890
Speaker 5:  should.

533
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:01,780
Speaker 1:  I'm curious your view here. Right? You've got a company that had an activist

534
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,510
Speaker 1:  investor. They kicked out the founder CEO. They brought in the new CEO. He

535
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:07,480
Speaker 1:  said, we're going to grow it. There's one way to grow it, which is to make

536
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,230
Speaker 1:  it friendlier and to explore, expose more of the good things to more

537
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:15,190
Speaker 1:  people and get them to sign up and engage. Then you've got Ilan who wants

538
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:19,180
Speaker 1:  to open-source the algorithm, which implies the algorithm is important. And

539
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:22,420
Speaker 1:  we have all been talking to the algorithm is like not what Twitter is, power

540
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:26,410
Speaker 1:  users care about and it is bad. So you can open source it all

541
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:29,680
Speaker 1:  day, right? Like the ranking algorithm on Twitter shows you tweets from 17

542
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,340
Speaker 1:  hours ago or whatever, like the product isn't good. But somewhere in

543
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,850
Speaker 1:  there is, I mean, that's the story of Twitter whip sawing

544
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:40,820
Speaker 1:  between not having a chronological or doing the home

545
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,780
Speaker 1:  feed by default and making you hit 15 buttons

546
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,480
Speaker 1:  to click back to chronological recently and then walking that back. Cause

547
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,350
Speaker 1:  all our power users like that dynamic between the people who make Twitter,

548
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:55,250
Speaker 1:  what it is and the people it needs to attract the

549
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:58,430
Speaker 1:  service are radically different, have radically different needs. That's been

550
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:01,850
Speaker 1:  the motivating dynamic of Twitter, I think maybe the whole time. And I don't

551
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:04,940
Speaker 1:  see it. I don't actually know where the company is on that perspective

552
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,300
Speaker 1:  now. And I don't know if Ellen's going to knock it off that path, whatever

553
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:08,810
Speaker 1:  it is

554
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:12,620
Speaker 6:  Funny. You asked me that I did an interview with Twitter, new product leadership

555
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:16,520
Speaker 6:  team about three weeks ago, talking about this. And before

556
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:20,510
Speaker 6:  Ilan came in, they were addressing, hoping to address a law

557
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:24,460
Speaker 6:  under a full-time CEO for the first time in years. And we should know

558
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,140
Speaker 6:  like the reason Twitter has been so stagnant as a product is because Jack

559
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:31,130
Speaker 6:  let it run by committee. Cause he was part-time and only weighed in on things

560
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:34,940
Speaker 6:  he cared about. And so it was just this like imagine humping like

561
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:38,930
Speaker 6:  Twitter being run by like 12 executives who need to like figure out

562
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:42,890
Speaker 6:  their little fiefdoms. It didn't get anywhere right now.

563
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:46,670
Speaker 6:  They, they are trying to reignite it and also

564
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:49,280
Speaker 6:  turn it back a little bit to the early days, which I think is the answer

565
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,240
Speaker 6:  here. If we were like up until 2015, Twitter was there were, there

566
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,420
Speaker 6:  was a VC fund that was literally just investing in Twitter

567
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:00,200
Speaker 6:  clients. Like there was a whole economy. People

568
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,860
Speaker 6:  thought that Twitter was going to be this platform. And the

569
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,160
Speaker 6:  best features of Twitter were invented by developers who were building on

570
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,760
Speaker 6:  top of Twitter. And then we remember when they pulled the API out from everyone,

571
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,340
Speaker 6:  when they realized we've got to bring everyone into our client because we

572
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:17,060
Speaker 6:  need to sell advertising, we're going to start gating our new features to

573
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,900
Speaker 6:  our client. And they slowly choked the life out of the tweet, decks, the

574
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,840
Speaker 6:  Tweenies et cetera. I was just talking to their head of the guy, the

575
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,790
Speaker 6:  lead guy. That's trying to bring the API back to those early days,

576
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:32,540
Speaker 6:  like a few weeks ago. So they were wanting to, and then in the background

577
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,170
Speaker 6:  they eventually want to just put it on like a decentralized protocol where

578
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:39,860
Speaker 6:  Twitter is one of the platforms that then has

579
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:43,790
Speaker 6:  clients on top of it. Right? So they want to like really abstract this

580
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,750
Speaker 6:  and turn it into like a, a protocol for others to build on similar

581
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:51,050
Speaker 6:  to email, similar to RSS. And that's a

582
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:54,590
Speaker 6:  unique point of view in the world. Facebook snap, all these

583
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:58,250
Speaker 6:  other social media companies, they're becoming like their own silos, their

584
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:01,760
Speaker 6:  own super apps, trying to pull all the interactions into their

585
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,330
Speaker 6:  client. So that's the opportunity. I think Twitter has to do something unique

586
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:08,570
Speaker 6:  in the world and also kind of it aligns with the public nature of

587
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,870
Speaker 6:  Twitter. And also they're just finally starting to look into

588
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:15,050
Speaker 6:  subscriptions, which has been like, everyone's been saying, and Elon was

589
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:18,680
Speaker 6:  saying this, he would want the company to do subscriptions and to charge

590
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,310
Speaker 6:  its highest users. I guess maybe not him. Maybe he gets a special

591
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:26,270
Speaker 6:  discount there, but you know, charge these accounts

592
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:29,900
Speaker 6:  that use these as their main marketing, you know, Tesla doesn't spend

593
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,620
Speaker 6:  anything on marketing because Elan has a Twitter account with 80 million

594
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,650
Speaker 6:  users, Twitter to Elan is worth billions of dollars a

595
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:40,230
Speaker 6:  year and they could be charging for that kind of stuff.

596
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:43,830
Speaker 6:  And you know, like I pay for Twitter blue because I want to change my app

597
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:47,820
Speaker 6:  icon. And I'm like, it doesn't really do anything. They put nuzzle in

598
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,780
Speaker 6:  it like, cool. Like they're going to bring, edit tweet to it. Cool. But like

599
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,720
Speaker 6:  they just haven't really, they're starting to show signs of willingness to

600
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,180
Speaker 6:  experiment again, but they haven't really leaned into it fully, but they

601
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,840
Speaker 6:  were in the process before Elan came in. So it's like, they didn't get the

602
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,830
Speaker 6:  chance to really try. So it's like, it's just kind of sad in

603
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:08,430
Speaker 6:  that way that now everyone's like been derailed by this because they were

604
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,970
Speaker 6:  really trying to turn the ship around and they had this gun to their head,

605
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,880
Speaker 6:  which was this growth target that their activist investor gave them.

606
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,330
Speaker 1:  I feel bad for the new CEO. Right. Like, yeah. Can you imagine getting that

607
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,970
Speaker 1:  job and being all excited and then he had a baby he's

608
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,680
Speaker 6:  Supposed to be on parental leave.

609
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,280
Speaker 1:  Yeah. And he made this like, I think extremely cool public

610
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,610
Speaker 1:  declaration that even after taking the new job as a CEO, he was going on

611
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:32,670
Speaker 1:  leave to like set an example. That leaves should be like, I love that. I

612
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:35,800
Speaker 1:  love this dude. Probably come on decoder. He's not going to do it. I don't,

613
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,210
Speaker 1:  I don't think I'm getting any Twitter executives for a while, but Elan you

614
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:43,200
Speaker 1:  are invited. Come on, decoder. Let's let's talk. But I

615
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,020
Speaker 1:  just, I feel bad for that guy in particular. Like, I don't know if his vision

616
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,170
Speaker 1:  was right out. If it was going to work, it seems very clear. He was never,

617
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,590
Speaker 1:  he's never going to get the shot to do whatever he wanted for even her appearance.

618
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:56,190
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I agree. And now what is the best outcome of

619
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:00,030
Speaker 6:  this? I mean, it's that Elan potentially

620
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:03,900
Speaker 6:  backs out. I mean, I don't want to, like, he backs out the stock

621
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,500
Speaker 6:  tanks. Maybe they get some other passive investor in there and morale is

622
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,280
Speaker 6:  destroyed and people's options are underwater or Elon

623
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,120
Speaker 6:  does take it private and then people quit and mass, like, those are

624
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,270
Speaker 6:  kind of the two options right now, which is like not a good sign

625
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:21,480
Speaker 5:  Stock tank if he backs out, like, cause it hasn't

626
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,260
Speaker 5:  changed. It didn't change when he, he announced he was going to buy

627
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:25,560
Speaker 5:  it.

628
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,890
Speaker 6:  Well, there's still his premium in there from when he first disclosed his

629
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:31,020
Speaker 6:  steak, it would go, it would go 30 or below for

630
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,440
Speaker 1:  Sure.

631
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,950
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So Alex, I think that those are two possible

632
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:38,760
Speaker 7:  outcomes. I do not think that they are the only possible outcomes. And

633
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,390
Speaker 7:  again, the reason I don't think so is because now Twitter is in play and

634
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:45,990
Speaker 7:  it is an incredibly influential service for all that. It

635
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:49,830
Speaker 7:  is like all versus all fighting and like

636
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,770
Speaker 7:  very unpleasant. If you have more than about 2000

637
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,580
Speaker 7:  followers, because whoever controls, Twitter

638
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:00,480
Speaker 7:  controls a lot of what happens on cable news.

639
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,050
Speaker 7:  And like to some degree, you know,

640
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:07,750
Speaker 7:  buying Twitter, like there was this comparison that I saw on, on

641
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:11,430
Speaker 7:  Twitter, but about, you know, Bezos

642
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:15,330
Speaker 7:  buying the Washington post and Musk buying Twitter. And

643
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:18,600
Speaker 7:  like they are actually pretty comparable. Like the Washington post, I think

644
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,020
Speaker 7:  Bezos has been a great steward of, but with Twitter, what you're

645
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,890
Speaker 7:  controlling is essentially the comments section for the entire internet.

646
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:29,220
Speaker 7:  And that's really powerful. So, you know, if

647
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,090
Speaker 7:  I'm at another tech company, I'm like calling my

648
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:36,300
Speaker 7:  lawyers to see what I can buy without triggering antitrust.

649
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,780
Speaker 1:  This was the mark Cuban tweet.

650
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:41,500
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Because like that, like that actually is a

651
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,430
Speaker 7:  very, very powerful tool for marketing, for culture making for all of those

652
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:48,460
Speaker 7:  things. And I think that there are probably people out there who are interested

653
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,090
Speaker 7:  in the, in it. And like at this point, you know, if you're the board, maybe

654
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:55,810
Speaker 7:  you're looking for a white Knight. So like we might see another

655
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:57,070
Speaker 7:  player emerge.

656
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,510
Speaker 6:  Oh no, you're totally right.

657
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:01,540
Speaker 1:  I would not discount the power if you go for some of this, like if you're

658
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,450
Speaker 1:  one of those players, you get to put one over on Ilan.

659
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:07,840
Speaker 1:  Like there's more interest in that than I think you would

660
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,830
Speaker 1:  imagine.

661
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:12,760
Speaker 6:  No, I guarantee you if, if the year was 2015 and antitrust

662
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,660
Speaker 6:  scrutiny had not reached what it was, mark Zuckerberg has a blank check right

663
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,810
Speaker 6:  now. Like absolutely like what he did for WhatsApp. He put this

664
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:23,230
Speaker 6:  like, like Zuck multiple on it. That made no

665
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:26,320
Speaker 6:  sense. Like he did for Instagram. Like he's done for all the deals he cares

666
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,900
Speaker 6:  about. He'd buy Twitter for a hundred billion dollar

667
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,210
Speaker 1:  If he could get it. Right. But he's also just a rich guy. Like why isn't

668
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:34,960
Speaker 1:  he just staking someone else to do it? There's a lot of that out

669
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,900
Speaker 1:  there. Right? Like you actually didn't who doesn't. We never got to this,

670
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,810
Speaker 1:  but you know who doesn't have all the cash to this is Elon Musk.

671
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:44,350
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It does not know. He he's, he's not liquid. And he's already got a

672
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:46,240
Speaker 7:  bunch of loans against his shares.

673
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,780
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Tesla shares. Maybe he'll just like, I don't know. So advertising the

674
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:53,410
Speaker 1:  side of space, X rockets, like raise funds. We've gone way over on the

675
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:57,160
Speaker 1:  segment list. Thank you so much. I imagine you're going to be back to talk

676
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,590
Speaker 1:  about this a few times over the next few.

677
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:03,580
Speaker 7:  Listen, I, you know, I got relaxed, right? Like after 2018,

678
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:07,450
Speaker 7:  like things calm down and I was like, okay, okay. Like I don't have to, like,

679
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:10,750
Speaker 7:  I don't have to constantly pay attention to Ilan. I can take the alerts off

680
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:14,650
Speaker 7:  his tweets and now I regret it because the Ilan cycle has

681
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:18,460
Speaker 7:  started again. So I'm sure we're going to be talking about this

682
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,230
Speaker 7:  again,

683
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:23,020
Speaker 1:  Liz, every now and again, I would get text messages from, it was like in

684
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,140
Speaker 1:  the <inaudible> of early on cycles, usually like he's e-learning

685
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:29,770
Speaker 1:  again. And like the Elon Musk war room would spin up in slack.

686
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:33,670
Speaker 1:  Like here we are. That's great. All right. We

687
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:36,940
Speaker 1:  gotta take a break. Addie Robertson is going to come and join us to talk

688
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,150
Speaker 1:  about content moderation because that's another whole side of this. Thank

689
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:40,960
Speaker 1:  you, Liz. We'll be right

690
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,040
Speaker 1:  back.

691
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:36,800
Speaker 10:  You listened to this show weekend and week out because, well, we'd like

692
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,130
Speaker 10:  to think we offer sharp unfiltered insights into the biggest stories in

693
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,850
Speaker 10:  tech, business and politics. We also understand that your time is

694
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:47,030
Speaker 10:  valuable and we want you to apply the lessons that you hear on this

695
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,290
Speaker 10:  podcast.

696
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,720
Speaker 1:  We're back. Eddie Robertson is here. Hey Eddie. Hey, so

697
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,530
Speaker 1:  Alex's house. Heath is still here and Alex trans. So Addie we've been talking

698
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:05,400
Speaker 1:  about Ilan and Twitter. Of course, we just have Liz on. We must be

699
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,340
Speaker 1:  talking to the mechanics of the deal. What would happen? Twitter is a company

700
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:11,820
Speaker 1:  I wanted you on you and I spent an awful lot of time in our live segment,

701
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:15,540
Speaker 1:  content moderation and free speech and all the stuff Elan seems

702
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,750
Speaker 1:  very motivated to somehow change how Twitter

703
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:22,380
Speaker 1:  moderates and yesterday, I don't know if this was by

704
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,740
Speaker 1:  coincidence or by design or just the pure,

705
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:29,700
Speaker 1:  chaotic energy of the universe. He was onstage at Ted. You might

706
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:33,510
Speaker 1:  remember Ted, Ted, Pete, once influential conference for big

707
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:37,350
Speaker 1:  thoughts. We all, we all signed up for a free stream of

708
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:41,280
Speaker 1:  Ted yesterday because Elan was going to be there. And we like

709
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,030
Speaker 1:  sat through what appeared to be like a ninth grade social studies course

710
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:48,120
Speaker 1:  on a manual con and John Stuart mill. Like I literally read John cert melanose

711
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,030
Speaker 1:  in ninth grade. And Ted was like, have you heard, have you heard of John

712
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,120
Speaker 1:  Stuart mill? Like, I don't know what's going on there. It was like, you should

713
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,940
Speaker 1:  read it. It's foundations of Western liberalism were contained in John

714
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,500
Speaker 1:  Stuart mill, but I don't know why the Ted audience needed to know that information.

715
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:05,400
Speaker 1:  Anyway. So Chris Anderson, who is the head of Ted sat

716
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,090
Speaker 1:  down for an interview with Elan, I would describe that interview is

717
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:12,930
Speaker 1:  embarrassingly stupid, just on both ends. Like it was just real

718
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:16,680
Speaker 1:  bad, but we did learn some bits and bobs about

719
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,610
Speaker 1:  what Elon thinks and given just our history and covering it. I think

720
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:23,670
Speaker 1:  there's some challenges that so Eddie, you want to walk through what we think

721
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:27,420
Speaker 1:  we learned about Elan's approach to content moderation on Twitter?

722
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:31,050
Speaker 12:  Yeah. So there is very

723
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:34,920
Speaker 12:  long string of dumb things that were said that I am sure that maybe we'll

724
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,340
Speaker 12:  get into in more detail, but basically Elon Musks

725
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,970
Speaker 12:  says, okay, we understand that we want this to be a platform for global

726
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:45,210
Speaker 12:  free speech, but we know that you're going to have to follow laws. And we

727
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:48,840
Speaker 12:  think basically Twitter should just follow the laws of countries,

728
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:52,770
Speaker 12:  which implies sort of that ears. They're supposed to be just like

729
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:56,700
Speaker 12:  a first amendment Twitter. But at the same time, he also is really

730
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:00,420
Speaker 12:  mad about bots and spam. So he wants to get rid of bots because

731
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:04,230
Speaker 12:  bots are not part of free speech, mostly because he's mad about

732
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:07,800
Speaker 12:  cryptocurrency Schilling. I, it seems like. And

733
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,790
Speaker 12:  then at the same time, he's very worried about the idea that there's an

734
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:15,600
Speaker 12:  opaque algorithm that is demoting or promoting tweets in

735
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,470
Speaker 12:  ways that are not visible, which is one of those things that

736
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:23,280
Speaker 12:  it was a big meme and sort of conservative circles several years ago that

737
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,700
Speaker 12:  the idea that there was shadow banning quote unquote, that was making it

738
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,630
Speaker 12:  harder to search for things. But I'm not entirely certain what

739
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:34,560
Speaker 12:  he's referring to in this particular case, because Twitter tends

740
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,550
Speaker 12:  to be kind of upfront about telling people when they're banned and about

741
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:42,420
Speaker 12:  telling people like they to Russian

742
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:46,230
Speaker 12:  news outlet, like state news outlet, information and tweets, but they were

743
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:48,780
Speaker 12:  just like, yes, we're going to do this. We're telling you about this thing

744
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:52,500
Speaker 12:  proactively. So I'm, it feels like he's responding to a bunch of

745
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,710
Speaker 12:  things that are a little bit weird and

746
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:59,250
Speaker 12:  confusing and not actually the speech challenges

747
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,230
Speaker 12:  that Twitter faces.

748
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:04,320
Speaker 1:  Yeah. Let's start with opensource algorithm. Cause we were just talking about

749
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:08,040
Speaker 1:  it in the previous section a little bit, all these platforms have done

750
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:11,730
Speaker 1:  things to try to be more transparent. The thing that occurs to me in

751
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:14,580
Speaker 1:  just listening to people blather on about opensource source

752
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:18,060
Speaker 1:  algorithms and Ilan was like, we'll just put it on GitHub and people can

753
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:21,810
Speaker 1:  leave comments that has no connection

754
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:25,770
Speaker 1:  to being transparent about what happens to an individual tweet,

755
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:29,730
Speaker 1:  right? Like if you are, if you think you can derive what happened to your

756
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:33,630
Speaker 1:  tweet from the code being on get hub, you are the

757
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:36,690
Speaker 1:  single best computer scientists in the history of the world, right? Like

758
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:39,840
Speaker 1:  there's no way, like, I don't know how you would do that. Well, you want

759
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,740
Speaker 1:  as a button on every tweet that says this was down ranked or

760
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:47,520
Speaker 1:  up ranked or your, I dunno, your army of

761
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,420
Speaker 1:  Tesla, people was busy watching a baseball game today. So they didn't like,

762
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,780
Speaker 1:  you want some of that information or like Jack was mad at you when he turned

763
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:58,200
Speaker 1:  down the big knob in his office and said, Elan's reach, right. Like that's

764
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:02,130
Speaker 1:  the thing you're actually, after the code might tell you that those buttons

765
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:05,640
Speaker 1:  and knobs exist, but they will not actually tell you how they're used. So

766
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,600
Speaker 1:  just like from the jump, there's this massive discrepancy in the

767
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,210
Speaker 1:  outcome you want and the solution proposed.

768
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:15,510
Speaker 12:  Yes. It also does not mention really how, I guess you leave a comment on

769
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:18,570
Speaker 12:  GitHub and then there's just an army of moderators that will check and be

770
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:22,500
Speaker 12:  like, okay. So all the tweets that we moderated based on this turns

771
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,200
Speaker 12:  out, we should have done that differently. Like it doesn't, the appeals

772
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:29,050
Speaker 12:  process is also a huge part of how Twitter works and why it's

773
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:31,840
Speaker 12:  frustrating when it's frustrating. And he, we didn't really learn much about

774
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:32,350
Speaker 12:  that.

775
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:36,130
Speaker 1:  Yeah. So that's open source algorithm, which I feel like we can just

776
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:40,030
Speaker 1:  dispense with. Although I will say that when pressed in this interview on

777
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:44,020
Speaker 1:  any specific Elan returned to the idea of open

778
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:47,830
Speaker 1:  source algorithm is a, was like his happy place. Like

779
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:51,430
Speaker 1:  here's this very, I mean, just embarrassingly stupid

780
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:54,670
Speaker 1:  exchange. This is my I'm just going to, I'm going to end up repeating this

781
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:58,270
Speaker 1:  until I die. So Chris Anderson is like, here's the

782
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:01,240
Speaker 1:  challenge. I'm just quoting Chris Anderson. It's a nuanced difference between

783
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,870
Speaker 1:  different things. There's incitement to violence. That's a no, if it's

784
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:08,740
Speaker 1:  illegal, which I would just say implies that there are some,

785
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:12,610
Speaker 1:  some form of legal incitement to violence, which if you can

786
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:16,150
Speaker 1:  discover, like let me know. Cause is that just like, let's do

787
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:17,680
Speaker 1:  swords. And like, it's like, I

788
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,010
Speaker 1:  dunno,

789
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:24,490
Speaker 1:  Whatever. So there's incitements to violence. That's a no, if it's

790
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:28,180
Speaker 1:  illegal, there's hate speech. Which some forms of hate

791
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:31,150
Speaker 1:  speech are fine. I hate spinach,

792
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:32,710
Speaker 13:  Which

793
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:36,100
Speaker 1:  Like, I just like echoing through my head. Like you didn't

794
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,730
Speaker 1:  prepare, you don't know what you're talking about. All right. So then here's

795
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:43,450
Speaker 1:  the example. Ilan says, spinach is delicious. If it's sauteed in cream sauce,

796
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:47,110
Speaker 1:  this is all hack actually happened. Then Chris Anderson says, let's say I

797
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:50,590
Speaker 1:  tweet, I hate politician X. The next tweet is I wish politician X wasn't

798
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:54,400
Speaker 1:  alive. And then he qualifies this. Some of them said, this is about Putin

799
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,000
Speaker 1:  right now. So that's legitimate speech there. Just like

800
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,660
Speaker 1:  UN like if you're like, you know what if it's about that guy or some of us

801
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:04,780
Speaker 1:  have said it that's obviously, like I said it. So that's obviously cool.

802
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:08,500
Speaker 1:  Who knows? And then another tweet is I wish politician X wasn't a

803
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,530
Speaker 1:  lad alive with a picture of their head over with a gun Gunsight over at plus

804
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:14,110
Speaker 1:  her address. At some point, someone has to make a decision as to which of

805
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:17,500
Speaker 1:  those is not okay. Ken, an algorithm do that. The answer to that question

806
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,990
Speaker 1:  is fucking of course not.

807
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,880
Speaker 12:  I also like to point out none of that is hate

808
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,570
Speaker 12:  speech. Well, not even

809
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:28,540
Speaker 12:  forget whether it's legal or not. None of that actually is what people who

810
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:30,820
Speaker 12:  hate, who are like upset about hate speech say is

811
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:33,220
Speaker 12:  hate.

812
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,850
Speaker 1:  I hate spinach. Some sun hate speeches. Okay.

813
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:38,890
Speaker 1:  I,

814
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:42,790
Speaker 12:  I hate, spinaches actually closer to hates. I don't want

815
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:43,570
Speaker 12:  this politician

816
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:48,280
Speaker 12:  dead.

817
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:52,060
Speaker 1:  So I was just wondering if you asked

818
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:55,540
Speaker 1:  any four people, you know, like the four of us or like four of your

819
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:59,410
Speaker 1:  friends to make determinations on how to rank those things as

820
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:03,400
Speaker 1:  acceptable Arctic social speech, we would all disagree. That is the nature

821
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,880
Speaker 1:  of these debates. So can an algorithm do that? I was like, I dunno,

822
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,100
Speaker 1:  man, probably not

823
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,000
Speaker 13:  Just based

824
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,840
Speaker 1:  On what I know about human nature. So he says, surely you need some human

825
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,800
Speaker 1:  judgment. That point fine. He is minorly rescued himself.

826
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:21,700
Speaker 1:  Elan's response to this is just in my view. Twitter

827
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,880
Speaker 1:  should match the laws of the country. That's it? That's his

828
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,490
Speaker 1:  answer. And he's like, there's an obligation to that. But going beyond

829
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:31,880
Speaker 1:  that and having it be unclear, who's making what changes to where having

830
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:35,570
Speaker 1:  tweets, mysteriously promoted, demoted having a black box algorithm, promotes

831
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:38,510
Speaker 1:  some things, not other things. I think this can be quite dangerous. None

832
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:42,200
Speaker 1:  of that is an answer to I've given you three tweets, which one is unacceptable,

833
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:46,190
Speaker 1:  by the way, what's the deal with spinach and like the whole conversation

834
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:50,000
Speaker 1:  is here's something that appears to be a hard question. Anyone

835
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,960
Speaker 1:  saying open the algorithm up in some way. And I just don't see the

836
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,960
Speaker 1:  connection between the two Addie. I'm wondering if you do.

837
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,830
Speaker 12:  I don't either. It feels, this is a thing that it feels like a bunch of

838
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:04,640
Speaker 12:  people doing policy. I hear it mostly with anti-trust and speech where it's

839
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,460
Speaker 12:  like, oh, well, okay. So what's the problem with moderation it's that these

840
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:11,000
Speaker 12:  companies are too big, which is like, okay, fair. These are problems, but

841
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,330
Speaker 12:  there's you can't just like fix one thing in tech

842
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:18,290
Speaker 12:  and platforms and everything else gets fixed with it. This all

843
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:22,070
Speaker 12:  just seems there's so many nonsequitors in that interview.

844
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:24,590
Speaker 12:  It really, it was extremely frustrating.

845
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:27,980
Speaker 1:  Give me my favorite one. I'm sorry. This whole thing was so

846
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:31,940
Speaker 1:  stupid. So Ilan says obviously Twitter or any form is bound by the laws of

847
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:34,850
Speaker 1:  the country that operates in. So obviously there are some limitations in

848
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:37,940
Speaker 1:  three speech in the United States. He says, obviously there's some limitations

849
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:40,370
Speaker 1:  in Twitter. I have to abide by those rules. And then Chris Anderson follows

850
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:43,850
Speaker 1:  up. So you can incite people to violence, like direct incitement of violence.

851
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:47,420
Speaker 1:  You can't do the equivalent of crying fire in a movie theater, for example,

852
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:51,410
Speaker 1:  and Ilan responds with it. That is a crime. It should be a

853
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:55,370
Speaker 1:  crime. Now I will tell you that you can walk into

854
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:58,340
Speaker 1:  any theater in America and yell fire. And it is not a

855
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:02,300
Speaker 1:  crime definitely should not be a crime.

856
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:06,290
Speaker 1:  There's a long history of that. People who say that kind of immediately

857
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,990
Speaker 1:  out themselves as having no idea what's going on at a, you want to kind of

858
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:12,860
Speaker 1:  explain, I could try, but I'll just start crying.

859
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:16,670
Speaker 12:  I'm the, they're actually very, very good explanations

860
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:20,030
Speaker 12:  online. The Atlantic's that are really fantastic. One, but the long story

861
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:23,210
Speaker 12:  short is there has never been a case about whether there was a crowded theater

862
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:26,930
Speaker 12:  in some guy cried fire. It was a metaphor that was used in a

863
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:30,920
Speaker 12:  case, a Supreme court case. That was what was,

864
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:34,370
Speaker 12:  what was it about? It was about draft speech, right?

865
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:38,360
Speaker 1:  Yes. It was world war, one husband or two people in our,

866
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,360
Speaker 1:  her as a husband or wife. But two people were distributing leaflets in the

867
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,780
Speaker 1:  run up to world war. One saying, you should disobey the draft because war

868
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:48,530
Speaker 1:  is bad. They were socialists. And the government arrested them. And the

869
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:51,500
Speaker 1:  Supreme court said, that's cool that you can limit their speech in that way,

870
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,356
Speaker 1:  because they are creating a clear and present dangerous United States of

871
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:54,638
Speaker 1:  America,

872
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,680
Speaker 12:  Which was like shouting fire in a crowded theater

873
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,250
Speaker 1:  With the metaphor is like, certainly there are some limits and that was the

874
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:02,360
Speaker 1:  metaphor.

875
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:05,990
Speaker 12:  And then this was later overturned if I remember correctly. And so not only

876
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:09,710
Speaker 12:  was it not a thing that happened, it was a metaphor for a thing that

877
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:13,040
Speaker 12:  wasn't even that is at this point no longer even current.

878
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,850
Speaker 1:  Yes. So that shank was overturned in part by what's it

879
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:20,810
Speaker 1:  Brandenburg? Yeah. It's Brandenburg, Ohio. I don't remember that

880
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:23,840
Speaker 1:  case. It's about Brandenburg was a guy he talked to Ohio was mad at him.

881
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:27,780
Speaker 1:  I don't know. But they out clear and present danger, which is where that

882
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:31,170
Speaker 1:  phrase comes from. They threw out the whole case and they replaced it and

883
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:34,920
Speaker 1:  said, the government cannot punish inflammatory speech unless it directly

884
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,340
Speaker 1:  incites or produces imminent lawless action.

885
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:42,300
Speaker 1:  And that's it like, that's the thing, the government. So if you are

886
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:45,150
Speaker 1:  like, I want everyone to write, let's do

887
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:49,140
Speaker 1:  swords right now against the guy

888
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:53,010
Speaker 1:  is like, you're directing people towards imminent lawless action. The government

889
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:54,750
Speaker 1:  can stop that speech,

890
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:55,590
Speaker 5:  Right?

891
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:58,950
Speaker 1:  This has that's the limit of the first amendment. So all this other stuff

892
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:02,040
Speaker 1:  is not like Twitter would just have to let it go. If they're going to be

893
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,480
Speaker 1:  restricted by the first amendment

894
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,690
Speaker 6:  Also clear and present danger is a great Harrison Ford film,

895
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:07,590
Speaker 5:  Wonderful movie,

896
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:11,250
Speaker 6:  But also the U S of this is fascinating

897
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:15,060
Speaker 6:  because like most actual American based social media companies, the

898
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:18,670
Speaker 6:  vast majority of Twitter's users are not in the United States.

899
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:22,650
Speaker 6:  And the promise of Twitter is that someone in one country can

900
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:26,340
Speaker 6:  talk and tweet to someone in another. So either you're going to

901
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:29,550
Speaker 6:  geo lock Twitter and it's ad tech stack, and it's

902
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:33,510
Speaker 6:  everything to every country you operate in, or

903
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:36,960
Speaker 6:  you have to pick some balance of the U S

904
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,800
Speaker 6:  constitution, what the EU wants, what India wants, which is

905
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,430
Speaker 6:  increasingly less democratic. And China's just like,

906
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:48,420
Speaker 6:  no, you can't be here. Right? So like, how do you navigate all that? And

907
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:51,690
Speaker 6:  if you're going to abide by the laws of the country, you operate

908
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:55,560
Speaker 6:  in this, every platform is tied up in this right now because you

909
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:59,070
Speaker 6:  can't really do it. You can't like, like Facebook

910
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:02,880
Speaker 6:  has this problem all the time. And I just don't see

911
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,880
Speaker 6:  Ian really wrestling with that in the interview. It wasn't brought up at

912
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:06,240
Speaker 6:  all.

913
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,090
Speaker 12:  So the funny thing is, Twitter has done that in the Twitter, had to deal

914
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:12,480
Speaker 12:  with this with hate speech in Germany and France around 2012. And its solution

915
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,470
Speaker 12:  was withholding tweets, which is that you can be a Nazi

916
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:19,890
Speaker 12:  on Twitter and post Nazi stuff. But in Germany, you won't get to see the

917
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:23,010
Speaker 12:  Nazi tweets. They will be basically as geo locked.

918
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:26,490
Speaker 12:  And Elon seems to have given this much less thought than everyone at

919
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,620
Speaker 12:  Twitter,

920
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:29,610
Speaker 1:  Shocker.

921
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:33,540
Speaker 5:  I'm just kind of shocked that he announced, like when he said he

922
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:37,170
Speaker 5:  wanted to buy this company, it was to protect free speech. And then he

923
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:40,230
Speaker 5:  immediately goes to this Ted talk and says, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll just

924
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:43,830
Speaker 5:  listen to the, the, the laws of the whatever country and like, okay.

925
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:45,870
Speaker 5:  But those are not the same thing.

926
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:49,560
Speaker 1:  Okay. So I sort of understand that argument. I will say, I have a sympathy

927
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:53,400
Speaker 1:  towards that argument in this specific way, these

928
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,100
Speaker 1:  companies are all pretty big. This is I think, where the fuzziness or the

929
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:59,970
Speaker 1:  antitrust comes along. So if you're like, there's only four companies

930
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:03,690
Speaker 1:  that really have it locked in social media, their moderation. I don't know

931
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:07,650
Speaker 1:  that I agree with all this, but this is my sympathy. Facebook's moderation

932
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:11,640
Speaker 1:  decisions are opaque to me. There's no process. It doesn't

933
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:15,210
Speaker 1:  feel fair. Twitter's moderate, whatever it is, it would be

934
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:18,990
Speaker 1:  better if our elected representatives were voting on speech

935
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:22,830
Speaker 1:  regulations, right? Like that's, that's where you're going. You're saying,

936
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:26,410
Speaker 1:  I believe in free speech, I'd rather have the government issue, speech

937
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:30,280
Speaker 1:  regulations than these companies that I hate and are really big. And I can't

938
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:34,240
Speaker 1:  switch away from, I would put, I understand that

939
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,300
Speaker 1:  argument. It is also

940
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:41,090
Speaker 1:  crazy to be like, what I would like is for the United States

941
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:45,070
Speaker 1:  to throw away the first amendment and start issuing government

942
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:46,720
Speaker 1:  speech regulations.

943
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,960
Speaker 12:  It's also the very, the U S ness of it comes up again, because there are

944
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:53,020
Speaker 12:  just, there are a bunch of countries where if you value any kind of free

945
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:56,470
Speaker 12:  expression, they are not following those rules. Like you just, you cannot

946
00:56:56,470 --> 00:57:00,190
Speaker 12:  possibly say I value free expression. And I believe that we need to operate

947
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:03,580
Speaker 12:  according to these two, like China's regulations,

948
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:07,180
Speaker 1:  Right? So this is, I've been trying to describe the mental

949
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:11,050
Speaker 1:  flip that you need to make if you're based in the United States. So

950
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:14,830
Speaker 1:  in the United States, your baseline perspective is that you can

951
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:18,310
Speaker 1:  say anything you want in the first amendment,

952
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:22,270
Speaker 1:  prohibits the government from doing all that X, Y, and Z, right?

953
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:26,050
Speaker 1:  So you're like in a permissive structure and all like

954
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:29,860
Speaker 1:  let's do, swords is illegal and that's child pornography is

955
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:33,670
Speaker 1:  illegal. Even make a tortured argument that the expansion

956
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:37,330
Speaker 1:  of copyright law makes some kind of expression illegal. And the government

957
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:39,970
Speaker 1:  has created a private whatever. That's just me. I'm going to leave that alone.

958
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:42,850
Speaker 1:  I'm defamation law, right? It's like, there's an explosion in defamation

959
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:46,270
Speaker 1:  law cases. We're getting more letters than ever for our coverage. Okay. But

960
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:49,570
Speaker 1:  that's still a permissive structure. There's a small list of things that

961
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:52,930
Speaker 1:  might reasonably chill your speech. Otherwise, it's a free for all. You go

962
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:55,690
Speaker 1:  to a company like outset, or you go to a country like outside, like

963
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:58,840
Speaker 1:  India. It is actually the absolute

964
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,620
Speaker 1:  flip where it's a restricted culture. And there's a smallest of things you

965
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:06,550
Speaker 1:  are able to say. And that those countries have demanded

966
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:10,360
Speaker 1:  that social media companies like Twitter and Facebook have offices. There

967
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:14,290
Speaker 1:  have employees there. The Indian government has sent the police to

968
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:17,950
Speaker 1:  Twitter's offices because Twitter was labeling tweets

969
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:21,850
Speaker 1:  from the BJP party as manipulated information. They're

970
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:25,420
Speaker 1:  calling out lies from the government and the police showed up at their office.

971
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:28,330
Speaker 1:  That is a restrictive culture. So if you're based in the U S and you're like,

972
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:31,990
Speaker 1:  it should be the laws of the country. Your entire framework is the

973
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:35,980
Speaker 1:  permissive framework of speech United States, and almost everywhere else.

974
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:39,970
Speaker 1:  It is a restrictive culture where there's mostly, mostly, you cannot

975
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:43,900
Speaker 1:  do things. And I don't know that you want us thought about it. Ilan is

976
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:47,170
Speaker 1:  not from this country. He grew up in another country with a different attitude

977
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:50,590
Speaker 1:  towards speech, South Africa. He obviously has huge factories in

978
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:54,580
Speaker 1:  China, in Germany. It's just unclear why he hasn't thought

979
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:55,420
Speaker 1:  any of that through.

980
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:58,930
Speaker 5:  He did think it through. And I think he was saying one thing in his

981
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:02,650
Speaker 5:  sec, filing to like drum up support

982
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:06,610
Speaker 5:  from, from his, his base fandom. And then another thing

983
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:10,240
Speaker 5:  in this Ted talk, like I think he various cognizant of the fact

984
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,810
Speaker 5:  that he can't have it both ways, but he can say I'm a

985
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:16,780
Speaker 5:  champion of free speech. Cause what's the, like the sec can just be like,

986
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:20,650
Speaker 5:  no, you're not like they're not going to do that. Like, like we're all

987
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:23,780
Speaker 5:  sitting there. Like nobody, you D like, that's, doesn't make sense. And he's

988
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:26,450
Speaker 5:  like, oh yeah, yeah, I know. But I'm a champion of free speech. Like, that's

989
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:29,900
Speaker 5:  just always is kind of like modus operandi, right? Like he's always kind

990
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:30,500
Speaker 5:  of like,

991
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,800
Speaker 12:  Was always, also did this, like Dick Costolo was in

992
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:37,310
Speaker 12:  2012 or 2011 was late. Twitter's were the free speech wing of the free speech

993
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:40,340
Speaker 12:  party. And at the same time, yes. We also know that we have to follow the

994
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:43,820
Speaker 12:  laws of these countries and operate because we're a company. So it's totally

995
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:47,510
Speaker 12:  not a unique thing. But the interview was just, and I'm to be clear,

996
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:51,080
Speaker 12:  blaming Chris Anderson for this, it was an atrocious interview.

997
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:55,070
Speaker 1:  Yeah. I mean, it was extra, just embarrassing. So let's end here, which I

998
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:58,040
Speaker 1:  think is the hardest problem in the first amendment debate. And this was

999
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:01,490
Speaker 1:  handled very poorly. So we were talking about hate speech earlier. I will

1000
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:05,456
Speaker 1:  just tell everyone hate speech is not illegal in the United States of

1001
01:00:05,456 --> 01:00:07,910
Speaker 1:  America. Various states have tried to pass these laws. The Supreme court

1002
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:11,810
Speaker 1:  has mostly struck them down. You can just do some hate speech. People think

1003
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:15,740
Speaker 1:  it's illegal because it feels right for it to be illegal because the social

1004
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:19,490
Speaker 1:  platforms themselves have decided they don't want hate speech on their

1005
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:23,480
Speaker 1:  platforms. You know, it's really hard to do. If you hate speech on your platform,

1006
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:27,140
Speaker 1:  sell advertising. So they have like a business imperative, they have a

1007
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:30,560
Speaker 1:  consumer imperative. So the social platforms are decided, this is unacceptable.

1008
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,920
Speaker 1:  You know, norms in society have decided that being outright

1009
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,800
Speaker 1:  racist is unacceptable, but there's no log in hate speech. United States.

1010
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:41,600
Speaker 1:  There's just a bunch of social conditioning, then Ilan going on and on

1011
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:45,320
Speaker 1:  about spam and spam bots, commercial speeches,

1012
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:48,680
Speaker 1:  protected speech. So if you think about your physical mailbox, where the

1013
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:52,340
Speaker 1:  United States postal service delivers your mail, the government cannot

1014
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,860
Speaker 1:  proactively filter out junk mail.

1015
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,390
Speaker 5:  It should,

1016
01:00:56,390 --> 01:01:00,320
Speaker 1:  You might want it to, there are laws in the books that enable you to opt

1017
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:04,190
Speaker 1:  out of it or to be on a, do not mail list or do not call list. But you,

1018
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:07,610
Speaker 1:  the individual citizen have to like proactively say

1019
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:11,060
Speaker 1:  it. The government cannot make that decision for you because it's a, it's

1020
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:14,300
Speaker 1:  a prior strand speech, right? This is crazy. This also applies to

1021
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:18,170
Speaker 1:  email. There's a law called the canned spam act. You can see if it was

1022
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:21,200
Speaker 1:  effective, but the government basically is like commercial emailers have

1023
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,350
Speaker 1:  to provide these tags. They have to give you an opt out. They have to give

1024
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:28,340
Speaker 1:  you a button that says unsubscribe me, but they can't block it. And in

1025
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:31,160
Speaker 1:  fact, the thing that has walked it most effectively, email monopoly. This

1026
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,380
Speaker 1:  is what Sarah, John will tell you that like Gmail is and email monopoly.

1027
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:36,410
Speaker 1:  And that has been more effective at spam than any government

1028
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:39,860
Speaker 1:  regulation. Take that for what you will, but that's because the first amendment

1029
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:43,400
Speaker 1:  prohibits the government from doing it. So then Elon is like, the top priority

1030
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:46,460
Speaker 1:  I have is limiting spammers and scam bots and bot armies on Twitter. They

1031
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:49,400
Speaker 1:  make the product worse. I agree with him. But if you're limiting yourself

1032
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:53,360
Speaker 1:  to I'm following the law of the country, you're kind of immediately in a

1033
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,280
Speaker 1:  pretzel of logic, right? Addy.

1034
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,310
Speaker 12:  Yes. And it's, again, just one of those things where it feels like there

1035
01:01:58,310 --> 01:02:02,030
Speaker 12:  is a specific thing that he just doesn't want the site to

1036
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:05,960
Speaker 12:  do. And then he's trying to build this consistent framework around

1037
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:09,860
Speaker 12:  it. And it's, that's very difficult to do when it seems like what he

1038
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:13,040
Speaker 12:  has is just sort of a hobby horse that he doesn't want Twitter to do a thing

1039
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:16,730
Speaker 12:  that feels like it's political censorship, but

1040
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:20,700
Speaker 12:  hasn't, can't just like come out and say things that he's actually upset

1041
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:24,570
Speaker 12:  that they're doing. And so it makes up this very broad, like it has to follow

1042
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:25,980
Speaker 12:  the law kind of framework

1043
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:29,820
Speaker 5:  Wouldn't getting rid of all the bots also affect him

1044
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:33,690
Speaker 5:  because of his army of bots. Yeah. Like that seems bad for him.

1045
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:37,560
Speaker 12:  I mean, bod is also a weird term. Like I assume that like, there were a

1046
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:40,560
Speaker 12:  bunch of art bots on Twitter. There are a bunch of really fantastic things.

1047
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:44,040
Speaker 12:  I think he's just mad at the ones that pretend to be him and sell crypto.

1048
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:47,880
Speaker 1:  Right. So w like, how do you make that distinct distinction? Like, here's

1049
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:51,630
Speaker 1:  like another problem no algorithm can solve. Like, how do you decide

1050
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:55,380
Speaker 1:  between one of the bots that sneakerheads use to know when there's a

1051
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:58,590
Speaker 1:  sneaker drop? That's like, obviously sending a lots and lots of tweets to

1052
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:02,490
Speaker 1:  lots and lots of people at any given moment. And the crypto spam bots are

1053
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:06,090
Speaker 1:  applied at Ilan everyday. Like maybe a person could do it, but like the

1054
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:09,990
Speaker 1:  signals you actually get are very low. The verge automatically tweets every

1055
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:13,830
Speaker 1:  story that's a bot, is that allowed, like these are very fine

1056
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:16,230
Speaker 1:  distinctions and saying, I'm just going to get rid of spam bots, I think

1057
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:19,200
Speaker 1:  is like one of the more challenging aspects of Twitter, because some of the

1058
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,770
Speaker 1:  best parts of Twitter are automated or there aren't projects. There's a bot

1059
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:25,830
Speaker 1:  that every time we change the tagline and image in our masthead, there's

1060
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:29,310
Speaker 1:  actually two bots. Every time we change those things, it's just tweets what

1061
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:32,610
Speaker 1:  they are. I love that bot someone just made it for us to be, well, two people

1062
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:36,120
Speaker 1:  just made them for us. Are they illegal under Elon law? Like, I don't know.

1063
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:39,090
Speaker 1:  The, you should know the answers to these questions before you propose these

1064
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:39,660
Speaker 1:  kinds of things.

1065
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:42,120
Speaker 12:  We're just, I wish just all talk about our favorite Twitter bots. Now I

1066
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:45,840
Speaker 12:  have a bot that tweets random words on dark souls. You died

1067
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,040
Speaker 12:  screens.

1068
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:50,940
Speaker 1:  It's pretty good. My favorite bot is called schemer. It just, it just

1069
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:53,760
Speaker 1:  comes up with color schemes and gives them insane names

1070
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:57,630
Speaker 6:  Students. Next week, we need you to read chapter three of the free speech

1071
01:03:57,630 --> 01:04:00,990
Speaker 6:  century. Come back with your questions. I feel like

1072
01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:04,920
Speaker 6:  we've, I feel like if we say free speech again, and this podcast that

1073
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:05,790
Speaker 6:  will combust.

1074
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:09,090
Speaker 1:  Yeah. We shouldn't take a break. This interview

1075
01:04:09,090 --> 01:04:10,440
Speaker 1:  sucked and everyone should feel

1076
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:16,470
Speaker 1:  bad.

1077
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:18,960
Speaker 1:  I mean, it is like directly as I, as I'm saying it

1078
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,920
Speaker 1:  like as a person who interviews people about

1079
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:26,160
Speaker 1:  their ideas every week, like if your

1080
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:29,970
Speaker 1:  approach is, I think Twitter's moderation is bad, such that it is a threat

1081
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:33,300
Speaker 1:  to civilization, which is more or less what he wants that yesterday, right?

1082
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,810
Speaker 1:  This is a civilizational catastrophe editor. You got to really interrogate

1083
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:40,170
Speaker 1:  that. And you got to really be prepared to answer those questions. And if

1084
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:43,500
Speaker 1:  you think that the first amendment is the correct set of rules,

1085
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:47,160
Speaker 1:  like you're going to run into every other country in the world that thinks

1086
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:50,790
Speaker 1:  differently that you are trying to sell Teslas in. And that's just like a

1087
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:53,790
Speaker 1:  bad dynamic for you. All right, we're gonna take a break. We're gonna come

1088
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:57,720
Speaker 1:  back. We're gonna talk about gadgets, Gadgets for your face. We'll be

1089
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:57,840
Speaker 1:  right

1090
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:02,490
Speaker 1:  back.

1091
01:05:54,370 --> 01:05:57,370
Speaker 15:  Hi, I'm Zach Beecham and I cover global politics and democracy for

1092
01:05:57,370 --> 01:06:00,820
Speaker 15:  Vox. I'm currently hosting a special four-part series in the Vox

1093
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:04,600
Speaker 15:  conversations feed called the war in Ukraine explained each

1094
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:07,540
Speaker 15:  episode. I sit down with an expert to unpack a different dimension of this

1095
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:11,440
Speaker 15:  generation defining conflict. The series is designed to give you a top

1096
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:15,430
Speaker 15:  to bottom understanding of the Ukraine war, starting from the very beginning

1097
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:18,550
Speaker 15:  to what it could mean for the future, not only of Europe, but the entire

1098
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:22,270
Speaker 15:  world. In part one, I spoke with political scientists and scholar of Russian

1099
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:26,050
Speaker 15:  politics, Yoshiko Herrera about why Putin invaded Ukraine in the first

1100
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:29,740
Speaker 15:  place. And part two, I spoke with Tufts university professor and sanctions

1101
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:33,670
Speaker 15:  expert, Dan Drezner on the unprecedented economic warfare being waged

1102
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:37,480
Speaker 15:  by Western countries on Russia, in retaliation for the attack. And this

1103
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:41,140
Speaker 15:  week for part three of speaking with nuclear policy expert, Jeff Lewis about

1104
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:45,100
Speaker 15:  the risks that this war escalates to a nuclear exchange and what

1105
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:48,700
Speaker 15:  we can do to prevent them listen and subscribe to Fox conversations

1106
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:49,810
Speaker 15:  today, to hear the whole

1107
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:55,450
Speaker 15:  series.

1108
01:06:55,450 --> 01:06:59,320
Speaker 1:  Alright, we are back at a and Mr. Heath are still with us.

1109
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:03,070
Speaker 1:  Let's talk about gadgets, Alex, in the midst of all this, you published

1110
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:06,820
Speaker 1:  a huge scoop this week. You have the entire Metta AR

1111
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:10,810
Speaker 1:  roadmap. What the company formerly known as Facebook wants to do for computers

1112
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:14,650
Speaker 1:  on your face. It seems challenging. It does seem like bet the company

1113
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:15,490
Speaker 1:  walk us through it.

1114
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:19,360
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So everyone remembers that pretty wild video that

1115
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:22,510
Speaker 6:  mark Zuckerberg shot last

1116
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:26,230
Speaker 6:  fall. October-ish when he announced the rebrand to Metta,

1117
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:30,010
Speaker 6:  here's a AR you know, chess game on a table, and you're

1118
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:33,250
Speaker 6:  playing with a hologram, you know, the classic stuff that we've seen in these,

1119
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:36,730
Speaker 6:  these demos on stage. Yeah. Mark fenced with a

1120
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:37,900
Speaker 6:  hologram let's do

1121
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:41,290
Speaker 1:  Shorts. See it all comes back to doing stories.

1122
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:44,860
Speaker 6:  It's all connected. What is the, what

1123
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:48,130
Speaker 6:  is free speech in the metaverse? Oh boy.

1124
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:52,000
Speaker 6:  And the holy grail device. He's called around all this

1125
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,510
Speaker 6:  as AR glasses, which we've talked about a lot on this show. I

1126
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:59,500
Speaker 6:  imagine most of our listeners know the distinctions between VR and AR.

1127
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:03,400
Speaker 6:  So I won't explain that right now, but yeah, I set out to answer the question.

1128
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:07,000
Speaker 6:  How soon are these things actually coming? What are they going to look like?

1129
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,510
Speaker 6:  And what is the long-term commitment to this as a product category, it turns

1130
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:14,110
Speaker 6:  out it's a pretty, long-term big commitment. So they have three

1131
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:17,990
Speaker 6:  generations of full AR glasses. They're called Nazare

1132
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:21,830
Speaker 6:  it's sucker Berg's pet project. And he's got thousands of people working

1133
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:25,190
Speaker 6:  on them, spending billions of dollars. And the first version is coming in

1134
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:28,980
Speaker 6:  2024, it's going to be an early adopter developer gear

1135
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:32,750
Speaker 6:  device. They're going to sell like low tens of thousands of them. The bill

1136
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:36,680
Speaker 6:  of materials on these classes is in the thousands of dollars. So

1137
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:40,310
Speaker 6:  they have to figure out how to subsidize that, which is going to be challenging.

1138
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:44,210
Speaker 6:  The battery life is like four hours. So they're mostly going to be used

1139
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:48,170
Speaker 6:  indoors, but a pretty impressive field of you. Some

1140
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:51,230
Speaker 6:  pretty impressive specs, honestly, custom silicone custom wave

1141
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:55,010
Speaker 6:  guides, the best of the best and you know, no

1142
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:58,430
Speaker 6:  expense spared. And that's what we're getting from the company. Literally

1143
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:02,180
Speaker 6:  investing the most with like a founder led just

1144
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:06,050
Speaker 6:  insane fervor behind it. That's what's coming

1145
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:09,050
Speaker 6:  with that. And then they have another version two years later, and another

1146
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:12,800
Speaker 6:  version two years later, and there's another device coming in 2024,

1147
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:16,790
Speaker 6:  another pair of glasses that has like a smaller heads up display.

1148
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:20,570
Speaker 6:  That's more Google glass. Like that's more kind of notifications.

1149
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:24,050
Speaker 6:  And the distinction that one's called hyper Nova, they all have these, like

1150
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:28,010
Speaker 6:  the main air glasses are a Ryan, the smart glasses with the little

1151
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:31,970
Speaker 6:  display or hyper Nova. And the distinction is

1152
01:09:31,970 --> 01:09:35,840
Speaker 6:  that hyper Nova will be, you know, still needing a phone

1153
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:39,740
Speaker 6:  to work. So, but it's the idea is to lessen the dependence

1154
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:43,520
Speaker 6:  on the phone and the main air glasses do not need a phone to

1155
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:47,240
Speaker 6:  work. They'll have a little phone like device. It's not a phone

1156
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:51,110
Speaker 6:  though that will offload wireless li some of the compute.

1157
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:54,920
Speaker 6:  So it doesn't literally burn your face, which we've

1158
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:58,850
Speaker 6:  also talked about on the ship that's what's coming and what Mehta has

1159
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:01,910
Speaker 6:  up its sleeve that I think a lot of people will be surprised by when this

1160
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:05,810
Speaker 6:  ships is this a neural interface. I guess we

1161
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:09,500
Speaker 6:  could call it mind reading technology. They don't want to call it that because

1162
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:10,620
Speaker 6:  it's not reading your mind, but

1163
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:12,440
Speaker 12:  It's kind of

1164
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:15,710
Speaker 6:  Reading. I know, I know, I know Addie will explain this cause she's actually

1165
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:19,490
Speaker 6:  tried it, but you know, everyone, they bought this company called

1166
01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:23,420
Speaker 6:  control labs in 2019 for like a billion dollars. It was like

1167
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:27,380
Speaker 6:  12 people pre product launch. One of those classic, like funny

1168
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:31,080
Speaker 6:  Zuck, multiple acquisitions. And that is kind of the, the

1169
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:34,460
Speaker 6:  key that unlocks all this from an input perspective, because how do you

1170
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:38,390
Speaker 6:  control glasses on your face? They obviously don't have a touch

1171
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:40,460
Speaker 6:  screen. You're not going to have a mouse with you. You're not going to have

1172
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:44,090
Speaker 6:  a keyboard. You know, what, how do you do that? And so it's this

1173
01:10:44,090 --> 01:10:48,020
Speaker 6:  armband wristband that lets you kind of have a Phantom limb

1174
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:52,010
Speaker 6:  to type and control them. So that's at a high level. What is coming on

1175
01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:53,540
Speaker 6:  the AR side for Metta

1176
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:57,440
Speaker 5:  Is the idea here though, that like you can put on this wristband and

1177
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:00,650
Speaker 5:  not lift your hands up and look like a dill weed while you're manipulating

1178
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:02,360
Speaker 5:  things that nobody else can see.

1179
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:03,560
Speaker 6:  How do you want us to explain?

1180
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:07,250
Speaker 12:  Yes. So they're magic leap and

1181
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:11,150
Speaker 12:  Hola lens to different extents, but kind of similar. You use optical tracking

1182
01:11:11,150 --> 01:11:15,120
Speaker 12:  there's cameras in front of you. It can kind of pick up your hands

1183
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:18,930
Speaker 12:  and then you gesture and it's like minority report. And the minority

1184
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:22,380
Speaker 12:  report interface is both. You look weird cause you're gesturing to stuff.

1185
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:25,320
Speaker 12:  Nobody else can see. But also it's really tiring because you're lifting

1186
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:28,470
Speaker 12:  your hands constantly. And you have to be in a situation where you know

1187
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:32,280
Speaker 12:  that you like it's inside your field of view. You also just it's

1188
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:35,820
Speaker 12:  tiring because you're moving your actual hands around a bunch and you have

1189
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:39,330
Speaker 12:  to use these graphical interfaces that rely on you grabbing and

1190
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:43,290
Speaker 12:  pulling if you want. But the way that this works

1191
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:46,710
Speaker 12:  is that you put on this wrist band and it reads the

1192
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:50,700
Speaker 12:  signals that are going down your arm down like

1193
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:53,790
Speaker 12:  the neurons there that are telling your hands how to move

1194
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:57,480
Speaker 12:  basically. So it can act like a

1195
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:00,660
Speaker 12:  hand tracker that just doesn't need a camera because it can kind of detect,

1196
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:04,020
Speaker 12:  okay, you want to move your index finger, but it can also

1197
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:07,500
Speaker 12:  detect intention. Like the way that

1198
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:11,280
Speaker 12:  they tell people to start learning how to do this is that you put the

1199
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:15,090
Speaker 12:  armband on and you move your finger. Like you make a fist and

1200
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:18,570
Speaker 12:  your virtual hand reflects this because you're telling your

1201
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:22,260
Speaker 12:  arm, I want to make a fist. Then you put your hand on something hard and

1202
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:25,590
Speaker 12:  flat where you can't move it, but you tell your arm to make a

1203
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:29,520
Speaker 12:  fist. And it does the same thing because you

1204
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:33,240
Speaker 12:  are sending the instructions to, through your neural

1205
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:37,200
Speaker 12:  system, through your arm to say, I want to make a fist. And it doesn't

1206
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,360
Speaker 12:  matter that your actual hand isn't doing it.

1207
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:43,200
Speaker 5:  So this is like the same tech that you're seeing with like a

1208
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:46,800
Speaker 5:  lot of arm prosthetics, right?

1209
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:47,220
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1210
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:51,210
Speaker 12:  It's really, it's a thing that does a lot of the same work as

1211
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:54,870
Speaker 12:  brain interfaces like Neuralink. Okay. I shouldn't say neural link. Cause

1212
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:58,380
Speaker 12:  neuro link is like, I don't even know what's going on with it completely,

1213
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:00,960
Speaker 12:  but there are a bunch of brain interfaces. And the idea is that they're

1214
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,650
Speaker 12:  supposed to mimic the way that your brain sends signals to your

1215
01:13:04,650 --> 01:13:08,460
Speaker 12:  limbs. These are really good. If you don't have a working

1216
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:12,390
Speaker 12:  limb there at all, there is not really a super

1217
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:16,380
Speaker 12:  great reason. Why, if you have a functional limb, you

1218
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:20,310
Speaker 12:  should try to go straight to like Jack into your brain

1219
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:24,090
Speaker 12:  to do a thing that you could just tell your arm to do. It's like,

1220
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:27,210
Speaker 12:  I can't remember if I'm stealing this analogy from the

1221
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:31,020
Speaker 12:  actual, from like control labs, but it's

1222
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:34,530
Speaker 12:  like saying I want to write a command. And instead of using

1223
01:13:34,530 --> 01:13:38,100
Speaker 12:  JavaScript or something, you learn binary code and go and like write in

1224
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:39,180
Speaker 12:  binary code

1225
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:42,720
Speaker 1:  Once I kind of understand why you'd want to do that for an AR interface

1226
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:46,350
Speaker 1:  though. Right? You're seeing something no one else can see. And you're just

1227
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:50,160
Speaker 1:  like hit that button and the button gets hit. Like that would rule.

1228
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:54,150
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So hyper Nova the heads up display glasses that are more minimal and

1229
01:13:54,150 --> 01:13:57,990
Speaker 6:  use a phone. That's the ideas like really fast texting, really

1230
01:13:57,990 --> 01:14:01,920
Speaker 6:  like responding to notifications without needing to talk without needing

1231
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:05,880
Speaker 6:  to gesture. That's potentially going to be pretty cool. And Addy, like

1232
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:09,210
Speaker 6:  everyone I've talked to, who's tried the prototype. That's kind of more recent

1233
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:13,090
Speaker 6:  that Matta has. It's based on this as it's like one of the coolest tech demos

1234
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:16,840
Speaker 6:  they've ever tried and that it could be like pay for everything. If it

1235
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:20,710
Speaker 6:  works at scale, what do you think? Cause you, you tried it. How do you,

1236
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:22,480
Speaker 6:  what do you agree? There are not,

1237
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:26,380
Speaker 12:  I think literally the only thing I've ever tried tech wise

1238
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:29,320
Speaker 12:  that felt more cool and magical is the Oculus

1239
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:33,250
Speaker 12:  rift, which ironically is also a Facebook now.

1240
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:37,210
Speaker 12:  I, everything I like, no, I think it's incredible because the, yeah, the

1241
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:40,960
Speaker 12:  thing I'm getting at is that it feels like mind control

1242
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:44,860
Speaker 12:  to an extent, like it's not putting a thing literally in your brain,

1243
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:48,640
Speaker 12:  but it's letting you just feel like you're gesturing using your hand, but

1244
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,940
Speaker 12:  your hand is not necessarily moving. And your hand isn't necessarily

1245
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:55,720
Speaker 12:  using a thing where you have to have a one-to-one I'm pressing this

1246
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:59,680
Speaker 12:  button. It's like to some extent it can kind of learn

1247
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:03,250
Speaker 12:  from the way that you are thinking that it

1248
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:07,210
Speaker 12:  can match up. When I make this brain pattern, I want this thing

1249
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:10,450
Speaker 12:  to happen. And if you blend that with a bunch of really

1250
01:15:10,450 --> 01:15:14,410
Speaker 12:  advanced sort of predictive artificial intelligence systems, you can end

1251
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:18,040
Speaker 12:  up getting these really interesting, smart, like control

1252
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:21,790
Speaker 12:  systems that are super

1253
01:15:21,790 --> 01:15:25,330
Speaker 12:  different from anything that you've tried ever. In theory. Again, the thing

1254
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:29,200
Speaker 12:  I tried is a very, it was a 2019 demo. It was very early, it was basically

1255
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:32,830
Speaker 12:  playing pong, but it was super fun.

1256
01:15:32,830 --> 01:15:36,100
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And like, so what's going to happen is med is going to Trojan horse

1257
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:39,730
Speaker 6:  this into smartwatch that is coming first this year,

1258
01:15:39,730 --> 01:15:43,660
Speaker 6:  without this technology that I reported on last year, it'll have a detachable

1259
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:47,650
Speaker 6:  display with two cameras, like a little detachable GoPro on your

1260
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:48,850
Speaker 6:  wrist, which is

1261
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:50,710
Speaker 5:  Dick Tracy. Yeah.

1262
01:15:50,710 --> 01:15:50,920
Speaker 6:  That's

1263
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,540
Speaker 1:  A classic Metta idea. That's not going

1264
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:55,630
Speaker 6:  To succeed. So the idea is like, get people use to a smartwatch from Metta,

1265
01:15:55,630 --> 01:15:59,430
Speaker 6:  by the way, like the name change very much like motivated by all this hardware

1266
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:02,590
Speaker 6:  coming because they know that like the Facebook glasses, people in the U

1267
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:06,580
Speaker 6:  S are not going to buy. Right? So like the metal watch. And then by

1268
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:10,420
Speaker 6:  2024, when the glasses come out, they ship one with

1269
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:14,170
Speaker 6:  control, abs tech and it syncs with the glasses and

1270
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:18,160
Speaker 6:  apple. I don't like apples scared of this. I've heard because of,

1271
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:21,130
Speaker 6:  they think it's going to have privacy concerns obviously, and people are

1272
01:16:21,130 --> 01:16:25,060
Speaker 6:  going to think it's weird and too intimate. And so apple is very scared

1273
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:28,900
Speaker 6:  of this space. Snap. I just scooped bought a similar, it

1274
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:31,870
Speaker 6:  wasn't doing EMG. It was doing a different version of this that you wear

1275
01:16:31,870 --> 01:16:35,740
Speaker 6:  on your head. But another BCI company called next mind

1276
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:39,010
Speaker 6:  and they want to hook that up to their spectacles down the road. So everyone's

1277
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:42,730
Speaker 6:  trying to like with maybe the exception of apple come up with this

1278
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:46,630
Speaker 6:  brain BCI interface for these classes,

1279
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:50,020
Speaker 5:  Apple scared of it because these other companies are relying on

1280
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:53,140
Speaker 5:  like algorithms and stuff. Because I mean, this technology itself is not

1281
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:57,080
Speaker 5:  new. We're seeing it a lot in the accessibility space. Like

1282
01:16:57,080 --> 01:17:00,610
Speaker 5:  it's used for people who are paraplegic and need to control computers and

1283
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:04,480
Speaker 5:  stuff. It's used for people with residual limbs. Like it's

1284
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:07,690
Speaker 5:  not new technology. And I don't think there's privacy concerns about people

1285
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:10,040
Speaker 5:  being able to pick up a can of soda in real life.

1286
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:13,820
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Apple may come around to it. They've been hesitant, the apple headset

1287
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:16,430
Speaker 6:  that's coming that I think they'll probably still announce by the end of

1288
01:17:16,430 --> 01:17:19,940
Speaker 6:  the year, has this ring that they've worked on that has like touch on it.

1289
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:23,030
Speaker 6:  That's like their input. So people are finding all these ways that they can

1290
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:26,390
Speaker 6:  try to control these glasses. But it sounds like has crack something with

1291
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:29,450
Speaker 6:  control labs that maybe will put them ahead. They're on input.

1292
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:32,870
Speaker 1:  You know, it's funny because you know, apple is sort of like reverse engineered

1293
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:36,740
Speaker 1:  the Steve jobs magic. If you like, whenever they do a new category, the

1294
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:40,700
Speaker 1:  watch was like this, the Sterling example of this they're like, what we

1295
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:44,270
Speaker 1:  invented was a new input device. First. It was the mess. Then it was the

1296
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:47,770
Speaker 1:  touch screen. And then it was the digital crown. And you're like,

1297
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:51,320
Speaker 1:  what are you talking about? And so like

1298
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:55,160
Speaker 1:  Crown for such like apple, like

1299
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:58,610
Speaker 1:  for a long time, it was all in I'm like what you need to enter a new category

1300
01:17:58,610 --> 01:18:02,540
Speaker 1:  is like a big idea about input devices. So if they

1301
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:06,320
Speaker 1:  do glasses and they haven't like, they

1302
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:09,620
Speaker 1:  don't drop some big idea about input devices, they will actually be really

1303
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:13,010
Speaker 1:  out of form for them. Maybe it maybe it's this ring, but it just strange

1304
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:16,460
Speaker 1:  that they wouldn't be chasing that as hard as anything.

1305
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:20,240
Speaker 6:  I mean, the continuum of these devices is that the glasses are coming

1306
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:23,630
Speaker 6:  later. Metal will probably be first with like something that

1307
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:27,380
Speaker 6:  is like at least consumer like usable, like

1308
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:30,920
Speaker 6:  snaps, not even selling their AR spectacles because they're so expensive.

1309
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:33,110
Speaker 5:  Apples is like a developer kit, right?

1310
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:35,570
Speaker 6:  No, the apple headset's going to be consumer. I mean, it's going to cost

1311
01:18:35,570 --> 01:18:39,230
Speaker 6:  a lot of money, but the glasses Apple's not close on

1312
01:18:39,230 --> 01:18:42,710
Speaker 6:  really. So like the continuum will be these high-end mixed reality headsets,

1313
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:46,490
Speaker 6:  that sheet into AR by mixing high resolution

1314
01:18:46,490 --> 01:18:50,090
Speaker 6:  video pass through with AR effects. So that's what Matt is going to do with

1315
01:18:50,090 --> 01:18:53,870
Speaker 6:  Cambridge headset coming out later this year, Apple's going to do.

1316
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:57,770
Speaker 6:  And then later on that continuum, sooner for Matta is glasses

1317
01:18:57,770 --> 01:19:01,670
Speaker 6:  that are designed to not fully immerse you and

1318
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:05,210
Speaker 6:  Zach's thesis for this is like presence. It's like, you

1319
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:09,200
Speaker 6:  know, holodeck like holograms of people

1320
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:13,160
Speaker 6:  around you, which like it's supposed to be meant in D w mostly

1321
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:16,880
Speaker 6:  worn indoors, the battery life's like four hours Nila. Does this sound

1322
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:20,300
Speaker 6:  appealing to you? Would you spend, would you spend like

1323
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:23,990
Speaker 6:  $1,500, let's say conservatively on something

1324
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:27,740
Speaker 6:  that, you know, needs a wireless thing in your pocket, an

1325
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:31,430
Speaker 6:  arm band that reads your mind essentially control with your mind that

1326
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:32,000
Speaker 6:  you,

1327
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,240
Speaker 1:  It gets me about all that, right? If it's primarily designed for indoors,

1328
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:38,630
Speaker 1:  like, I don't know why it need a strap, a bunch of extra shit to my body

1329
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:39,860
Speaker 1:  to make that go

1330
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:42,320
Speaker 6:  Cause of input. Cause well, cause of computing and I

1331
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:45,080
Speaker 1:  Don't need the processing on my body. I don't, you know, like maybe the arm

1332
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:48,500
Speaker 1:  band, but like I don't need a battery pack. Like if you're telling me this

1333
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:49,880
Speaker 1:  is mostly, so I sit,

1334
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:51,020
Speaker 6:  It's not battery, it's

1335
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:54,560
Speaker 1:  Not battery. Okay. Mostly I'm sitting in my chair in my office. And like

1336
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,480
Speaker 1:  you pop up in a hologram. Yes.

1337
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:57,830
Speaker 6:  Yes.

1338
01:19:57,830 --> 01:20:01,760
Speaker 1:  That's it. That's the whole game. Yeah. I, I dunno, man.

1339
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:05,570
Speaker 6:  I mean, for V1 V2, maybe like you can take it outdoors with you and has more

1340
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:09,150
Speaker 6:  battery life. It's going have better optics, lighter design. The first version

1341
01:20:09,150 --> 01:20:12,240
Speaker 6:  is going to weigh a hundred grams, which is about four X, the weight of regular

1342
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:15,270
Speaker 6:  regular glasses. You're not going to, wouldn't want to wear these for long.

1343
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:17,370
Speaker 5:  People are going to be fee ears.

1344
01:20:17,370 --> 01:20:21,210
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And what I wanted to suggest with the story is like, this is all very

1345
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:24,630
Speaker 6:  expensive. He's spending over 10 million a year on this. He's literally bet

1346
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:28,080
Speaker 6:  the company on this and it's going to take like they're, they're they're

1347
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:31,590
Speaker 6:  modeling that they may be selling tens of millions of smart glasses

1348
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:35,250
Speaker 6:  collectively between the Ray-Bans between the cheaper hyper Nova

1349
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:39,030
Speaker 6:  glasses between the full AR glasses. That's all of them by like 20,

1350
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:43,230
Speaker 6:  28, like maybe tens of millions. And I'm just like, I don't know how

1351
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:45,390
Speaker 6:  much leash they have.

1352
01:20:45,390 --> 01:20:49,380
Speaker 5:  I mean, we've, we've talked a lot about AR and in the success of AR and there's

1353
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:53,340
Speaker 5:  like two big things. One, have they resolved the deal we'd faster.

1354
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:57,150
Speaker 5:  Will you look like a deal we'd wearing 'em into? Have they resolved the fact

1355
01:20:57,150 --> 01:21:01,110
Speaker 5:  that there was zero killer app? Because the best killer app is a privacy

1356
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:01,890
Speaker 5:  nightmare?

1357
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:05,430
Speaker 6:  Well, they haven't been invented yet. Like there's not the pro like the opening

1358
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:08,940
Speaker 6:  of this story. It's like these glasses that they showed in this video,

1359
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:12,900
Speaker 6:  like it's not based on any running code. It was all unity prototypes.

1360
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:16,290
Speaker 6:  There's not a wearable prototype internally of the one yet. It's like a

1361
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:20,070
Speaker 6:  stationary desk board. And like, they're hoping to have their wearable

1362
01:21:20,070 --> 01:21:23,640
Speaker 6:  prototype internally by the end of the year. Meanwhile, Zuck has literally

1363
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:27,390
Speaker 6:  bet the company on this concept and they do not have a working wearable

1364
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:31,380
Speaker 6:  prototype. So like the guts are incredible. I mean, I got like,

1365
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:35,310
Speaker 6:  there's, there's no company that that's like that. And

1366
01:21:35,310 --> 01:21:38,010
Speaker 6:  we can talk about the motivations. I mean, I put in the story, it's like

1367
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:41,820
Speaker 6:  Facebook and it's always like apple and Google that are always over them.

1368
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:45,090
Speaker 6:  And this is their chance, Zack, thanks to gal from under them. And also just

1369
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:48,750
Speaker 6:  like be seen as innovative and cool again, you know, like, cause Turkish,

1370
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:52,170
Speaker 6:  the traditional social media, stuff's not anymore. Then they can't buy.

1371
01:21:52,170 --> 01:21:55,830
Speaker 1:  Look, I am very sympathetic to the idea that Facebook will become or

1372
01:21:55,830 --> 01:21:59,310
Speaker 1:  Metta will become the next great hardware platform that will break

1373
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:02,970
Speaker 1:  the dominance of the two phone plans. Like that sounds

1374
01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:06,210
Speaker 1:  great. But you're saying the first one is going to connect to your phone

1375
01:22:06,210 --> 01:22:09,720
Speaker 1:  and like apple is going to have a competitive product right next to it. And

1376
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:12,960
Speaker 1:  like the idea that you're gonna spend $10 million a year to turn into pebble

1377
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:16,890
Speaker 1:  smartwatches, because apple will not let you send a text message

1378
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:20,550
Speaker 1:  in response to a notification on their phone is ridiculous.

1379
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:23,580
Speaker 1:  Like I hear that story and it's like, the first thing you're gonna do is

1380
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:26,850
Speaker 1:  quickly reply to notifications and it's connected to your phone. Like Apple's

1381
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:30,390
Speaker 1:  just going to turn off the notification API for everybody and be like, yeah,

1382
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:33,870
Speaker 1:  the watch can do it in our glasses. Can do it. Everything else is a security

1383
01:22:33,870 --> 01:22:35,160
Speaker 1:  problem. We're very sorry.

1384
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:39,000
Speaker 6:  I am so fascinated by antitrust. Like potentially making apple have to

1385
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,180
Speaker 6:  open up here, but they're not going to want Metta to be anywhere near their

1386
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:45,930
Speaker 6:  glasses. And like they're unmet as glasses to be anywhere near their phone.

1387
01:22:45,930 --> 01:22:49,500
Speaker 6:  Right. And so how do you you're right. How do you navigate that?

1388
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:53,190
Speaker 5:  I mean, this just sounds like a perfect setup for the usual kind of like

1389
01:22:53,190 --> 01:22:56,550
Speaker 5:  apple playbook, Facebook, Medis, excuse me. Will come

1390
01:22:56,550 --> 01:23:00,120
Speaker 5:  in. They'll do this will be like, this is really cool, but not super

1391
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:04,110
Speaker 5:  viable. They'll do it. What, till 20, 26 or whatever. And then apple will

1392
01:23:04,110 --> 01:23:08,020
Speaker 5:  be like, we figured out AR look at, look at what. Now you

1393
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:11,860
Speaker 5:  can use your mind to control things from your apple, watch on your

1394
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:15,670
Speaker 5:  new glasses that we sold you. Isn't it great. Like they're just going to

1395
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:19,030
Speaker 5:  let Facebook, excuse me, Mehta, figure out all of the

1396
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:22,000
Speaker 5:  like hard parts. And then

1397
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,990
Speaker 6:  It's classic apple. It's classic apple. They love to skip the messy middle

1398
01:23:25,990 --> 01:23:29,920
Speaker 6:  of new computing. Right. And like quest has been that up until

1399
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:33,760
Speaker 6:  quest two and they finally, there were more quest, two sold last year, the

1400
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:37,750
Speaker 6:  next boxes. So like that thing is hitting meaningful scale and the next version

1401
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:41,170
Speaker 6:  will have eye tracking, which will make the avatars like super cool and immersive.

1402
01:23:41,170 --> 01:23:45,070
Speaker 6:  So it's only going to get like dramatically better. Apple's watched all that.

1403
01:23:45,070 --> 01:23:48,310
Speaker 6:  They'd been secretly buying things. They'd been building experimenting

1404
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:51,670
Speaker 6:  prototypes. They're going to come out with this super high-end luxury. Like

1405
01:23:51,670 --> 01:23:55,420
Speaker 6:  state-of-the-art with all their M two chips, sensors, LIDAR and

1406
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:59,110
Speaker 6:  skip a year basically of where Mehta has been tech, not like from the

1407
01:23:59,110 --> 01:24:02,920
Speaker 6:  technology standpoint and have like not dealt with all that messy

1408
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:05,590
Speaker 6:  stuff that got up to now. And I think they're going to do the same thing

1409
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:09,490
Speaker 6:  with glasses. I think mark wants to be out there with them to show that

1410
01:24:09,490 --> 01:24:12,430
Speaker 6:  they're the leader, but Apple's going to wait and probably come out. And

1411
01:24:12,430 --> 01:24:16,330
Speaker 6:  like, I guess my thesis here is that if Meta's is coming out with their first

1412
01:24:16,330 --> 01:24:20,320
Speaker 6:  classes by 2024, I wouldn't expect Apple's until at least 2026.

1413
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:23,290
Speaker 12:  It's bizarre that we have not mentioned Google in this because Google is

1414
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:26,230
Speaker 12:  the only one of these companies that is actually currently selling a

1415
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:30,190
Speaker 12:  commercialized AR headset. They also own the

1416
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:34,180
Speaker 12:  company that made the predecessor to control labs project, which did not

1417
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:38,170
Speaker 12:  work very well, but was the same idea was a commercial product like

1418
01:24:38,170 --> 01:24:42,070
Speaker 12:  five years before control labs existed. And we are

1419
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:45,010
Speaker 12:  totally not talking about them because it seems like it's not even necessarily

1420
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:46,240
Speaker 12:  clear they're doing anything.

1421
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:49,150
Speaker 1:  They probably forgot like sooner if I just forgot that he even has any of

1422
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:49,850
Speaker 1:  this right.

1423
01:24:49,850 --> 01:24:53,110
Speaker 5:  Of these three companies, Google has the worst track record for

1424
01:24:53,110 --> 01:24:55,990
Speaker 5:  shipping hardware that people actually want to buy.

1425
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:59,920
Speaker 6:  Well, the problem with Google is focus. It's focus and they have

1426
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:03,010
Speaker 6:  the resources. They have the money, they have the assets, they have the best

1427
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:06,490
Speaker 6:  machine learning. They have maps with like, which is such a key asset for

1428
01:25:06,490 --> 01:25:09,640
Speaker 6:  glasses. They have like, they literally have the world mapped, which is like

1429
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:13,600
Speaker 6:  something that it has to figure out. And that assistant, they have the most

1430
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,260
Speaker 6:  impressive visual assistant that can like just see something and

1431
01:25:17,260 --> 01:25:20,620
Speaker 6:  identify it. It's incredible with classes, right? Like search on your

1432
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:24,250
Speaker 6:  face. They have that. The problem is, is that they don't have like a

1433
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:28,000
Speaker 6:  founder like mark, who is like pushing them to like

1434
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,570
Speaker 6:  focus everything on this. And they have a million things going on. They have

1435
01:25:31,570 --> 01:25:34,630
Speaker 6:  all this like regulatory scrutiny. They have all these big business lines,

1436
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:38,100
Speaker 6:  all this optionality. And I, you know, I did a story for us about they're

1437
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:41,560
Speaker 6:  doing this. High-end they're also working on a high-end mixed reality headset.

1438
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:44,320
Speaker 6:  They've Al they have all of the big tech guys have all kind of decided the

1439
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,500
Speaker 6:  high-end mixed reality is like, that's the near term. They have a glasses

1440
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:51,280
Speaker 6:  project. They bought north, which was like making smart glasses. They're

1441
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:54,760
Speaker 6:  working on something up in Canada. It'll work with a phone I'm

1442
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:58,540
Speaker 6:  told. And, but like, I just don't see the passion there from Google

1443
01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:02,230
Speaker 6:  yet. I don't see the focus. And I see where talent goes and all the

1444
01:26:02,230 --> 01:26:05,570
Speaker 6:  talent, either going to Metta or apple right now and back and

1445
01:26:05,570 --> 01:26:06,560
Speaker 6:  forth.

1446
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:09,830
Speaker 1:  The thing that you mentioned, the founder thing get mark is a founder of

1447
01:26:09,830 --> 01:26:13,310
Speaker 1:  Facebook. I think Tim cook is very focused on his legacy at apple. And he

1448
01:26:13,310 --> 01:26:17,150
Speaker 1:  has been saying for years that health and AR will be his twin

1449
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:19,640
Speaker 1:  legacies. And you can see how he's going to combine all of that.

1450
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:23,600
Speaker 6:  Yep. I repeat this all the time, but AR is literally the only

1451
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:27,590
Speaker 6:  thing that apple and Mehta agree on. Like the only thing that they agree

1452
01:26:27,590 --> 01:26:30,980
Speaker 6:  that is going to be big. So, I mean, we'll

1453
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:32,090
Speaker 6:  see.

1454
01:26:32,090 --> 01:26:34,850
Speaker 1:  Well, let's talk about the actual Metta glasses for a minute. Cause Addie

1455
01:26:34,850 --> 01:26:38,240
Speaker 1:  you've tried on virtually every one of these products.

1456
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:41,730
Speaker 12:  I'm not tried on there. I've not tried on snaps thing, but I try

1457
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:42,680
Speaker 12:  to.

1458
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:46,130
Speaker 1:  Yeah, but so like between the two of you, there isn't a face computer in

1459
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:49,670
Speaker 1:  the world that we haven't, we haven't strapped on here. So these

1460
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:53,630
Speaker 1:  glasses here's Ms. RA the full AR experience. And does doc wants 3d

1461
01:26:53,630 --> 01:26:56,990
Speaker 1:  graphics, large field of view, socially acceptable design, which by the way,

1462
01:26:56,990 --> 01:26:59,570
Speaker 1:  mark soccer, where he's like, I need a socially acceptable design. That's

1463
01:26:59,570 --> 01:27:02,660
Speaker 1:  a pretty broad remit coming out of duck, like

1464
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:03,380
Speaker 12:  Full

1465
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:07,280
Speaker 1:  Sunscreen face, like whatever you want socially acceptable, but sign.

1466
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:11,270
Speaker 1:  But whatever the team is hoping for a 70 degree field of view,

1467
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:14,840
Speaker 1:  maybe that'll happen. And won't, they look like the Superman glasses when

1468
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:18,230
Speaker 1:  he was Clark. Kent is what Alex right here. And they are really heavy. Now

1469
01:27:18,230 --> 01:27:22,070
Speaker 1:  we have talked on the show a lot about just like the stack of problems for

1470
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:25,640
Speaker 1:  AR glasses, right? You've got a display problem. You've got a

1471
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:29,300
Speaker 1:  camera problem. You've got a processing problem. You've got a battery

1472
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:32,840
Speaker 1:  problem. Where is this sitting in the current state of the art? Do you think

1473
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:33,500
Speaker 1:  Alex,

1474
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:36,470
Speaker 6:  It's pretty advanced. You know, a lot of the people I've talked to for this

1475
01:27:36,470 --> 01:27:40,100
Speaker 6:  story. It was like, this is actually a pretty impressive like tax spec that

1476
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:44,000
Speaker 6:  is in search of a compelling use case because the software side of this is

1477
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,600
Speaker 6:  still being built. They actually just decided the OSTP route. They want to

1478
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:50,000
Speaker 6:  take like in December, basically just

1479
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:50,780
Speaker 1:  Fuchsia, which is

1480
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:54,200
Speaker 6:  Hilarious. No, no, no. They, so they killed, they killed the future approach.

1481
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:57,860
Speaker 6:  So they were going to do fuchsia. They were doing a microkernel like this

1482
01:27:57,860 --> 01:27:57,980
Speaker 6:  show,

1483
01:27:57,980 --> 01:28:00,290
Speaker 1:  They were still using Google glasses. They just went to Android.

1484
01:28:00,290 --> 01:28:03,770
Speaker 6:  They're using the open fork of Android. And that's the same thing that powers

1485
01:28:03,770 --> 01:28:06,680
Speaker 6:  the quest. So there'll be able to share like apple libraries and stuff. So

1486
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:09,590
Speaker 6:  they may be able to bring some of the developer ecosystem over, but they

1487
01:28:09,590 --> 01:28:13,040
Speaker 6:  were wanting to do a microkernel like fully custom

1488
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:16,880
Speaker 6:  OS. And they decided that won't ship in time for 20, 24, basically.

1489
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:20,720
Speaker 6:  So like this is like do or die. And like, I just, the software

1490
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:24,290
Speaker 6:  side of it is the biggest question, mark. They do not have the platform,

1491
01:28:24,290 --> 01:28:28,010
Speaker 6:  DNA developer DNA that apple does. And developers are

1492
01:28:28,010 --> 01:28:31,970
Speaker 6:  very wary of Facebook dating back to Farmville. And

1493
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:35,330
Speaker 6:  when FameBit pulled the plug on all these developers, Oculus

1494
01:28:35,330 --> 01:28:36,740
Speaker 1:  Is sort of salsa in this problem.

1495
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:40,310
Speaker 6:  Right. They, they have, they have they've, they've got very meaningful, you

1496
01:28:40,310 --> 01:28:43,250
Speaker 6:  know, they're buying everything that's doing, going really well. But yeah,

1497
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:47,180
Speaker 6:  they do have developers that are doing well there. But

1498
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:50,840
Speaker 6:  the software side is the biggest question mark by far. And like, how do you

1499
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:54,590
Speaker 6:  build a holographic Kodak to use with messenger where it works, where like

1500
01:28:54,590 --> 01:28:58,340
Speaker 6:  on your phone, you can see the hologram, you know, or someone didn't

1501
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:01,620
Speaker 6:  like, cause the idea is like they've got these social apps that like they

1502
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:04,920
Speaker 6:  could use with the glasses where like, I don't need the glasses to like call

1503
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:08,490
Speaker 6:  you on your glasses. Right. And like that's the real unlock. And that's,

1504
01:29:08,490 --> 01:29:11,160
Speaker 6:  that's a hard problem that they're still very early on

1505
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:15,090
Speaker 1:  Adding the displays here, Alex is reporting their costly custom wave guides

1506
01:29:15,090 --> 01:29:18,990
Speaker 1:  and micro led projectors. I'm still just so

1507
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:21,930
Speaker 1:  skeptical of all of these display ideas.

1508
01:29:21,930 --> 01:29:25,890
Speaker 12:  That just sounds like what? Every, like everybody has custom wave guides

1509
01:29:25,890 --> 01:29:29,700
Speaker 12:  and everybody okay. Projection tech is like complicated, but it just

1510
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:31,440
Speaker 12:  depends on, it depends on how good the white cards.

1511
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:34,530
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I mean, snaps were for the spectacles. They were accustomed, but they

1512
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:37,260
Speaker 6:  were working with wave optics on them. And then they just bought wave optics

1513
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:41,100
Speaker 6:  for half a billion dollars when they decided they wanted to own that.

1514
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:45,030
Speaker 6:  But Metta is like, they're, I mean, they're building everything fully

1515
01:29:45,030 --> 01:29:48,030
Speaker 6:  like custom because they've decided they have to go that route, which is

1516
01:29:48,030 --> 01:29:51,690
Speaker 6:  what apple has shown is kind of the best way forward with like wearable.

1517
01:29:51,690 --> 01:29:54,930
Speaker 1:  Right. But I'm saying you're like everyone's in on high-end mixed reality

1518
01:29:54,930 --> 01:29:58,770
Speaker 1:  and right. And I think the reason for that is like

1519
01:29:58,770 --> 01:30:02,730
Speaker 1:  to really do the glasses. You have to invent a radically new kind of display

1520
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:06,270
Speaker 1:  tech and costly custom way of guides in micro led projectors. Like maybe

1521
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:09,930
Speaker 1:  they're going to do the best job of that, but that's still as near as I can

1522
01:30:09,930 --> 01:30:13,170
Speaker 1:  say, that's still pretty much in the pocket of where everybody is right now.

1523
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:16,950
Speaker 12:  So just a really broad term. You could, it's such a weird, messy, new

1524
01:30:16,950 --> 01:30:20,010
Speaker 12:  technology that there could be a really good version of that. That's very

1525
01:30:20,010 --> 01:30:23,910
Speaker 12:  thin and very interesting and has really good optics,

1526
01:30:23,910 --> 01:30:27,750
Speaker 12:  but it doesn't necessarily tell me a bunch about how

1527
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:31,650
Speaker 12:  good the system currently is. Like magically. I think magic

1528
01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:35,640
Speaker 12:  leap too. At this point, it has some of the best stuff that I've seen and

1529
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:39,630
Speaker 12:  tried with some limitations. And I don't know how this would stack

1530
01:30:39,630 --> 01:30:42,870
Speaker 12:  up to that. They have at this point, a pretty solid field of view

1531
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:45,210
Speaker 6:  Magically two 70 field of view. Isn't it?

1532
01:30:45,210 --> 01:30:48,270
Speaker 1:  Magic leap two is 70 diagonal degrees field of view.

1533
01:30:48,270 --> 01:30:51,390
Speaker 12:  Yeah. It's, they've started shipping them to like small partners

1534
01:30:51,390 --> 01:30:55,320
Speaker 5:  Or the meta headset's going to be, cause you've mentioned in your piece that

1535
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:58,440
Speaker 5:  they're going to be 70 field of you. Is that also diagonal? Are we talking

1536
01:30:58,440 --> 01:30:58,590
Speaker 5:  about

1537
01:30:58,590 --> 01:31:01,380
Speaker 6:  No, that's what the hope that they had. That's the hope that they had, and

1538
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:04,050
Speaker 6:  I don't think they're going to get there because then they're probably going

1539
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:07,260
Speaker 6:  for like a color richness and a resolution that's

1540
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:10,560
Speaker 6:  very, mark wants very crisp, like vivid

1541
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:14,430
Speaker 6:  holograms, like you to feel like you can you're someone's almost there.

1542
01:31:14,430 --> 01:31:17,790
Speaker 5:  You're looking at through a porthole on a boat

1543
01:31:17,790 --> 01:31:19,470
Speaker 6:  Like these glasses have eye tracking

1544
01:31:19,470 --> 01:31:23,160
Speaker 12:  Chicken leaps holograms at this point are pretty dear pretty

1545
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:27,150
Speaker 12:  solid, but also in the package that very much does not

1546
01:31:27,150 --> 01:31:31,020
Speaker 12:  look normal. They basically just acknowledged. He had look, there's

1547
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:34,980
Speaker 12:  going to be weird, big sunglasses. That's what we're doing. This

1548
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:38,760
Speaker 12:  is what serves our user base. So they have kind of

1549
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:41,310
Speaker 12:  different prerogatives and different requirements.

1550
01:31:41,310 --> 01:31:44,820
Speaker 6:  And the metal glasses will have eye tracking, which we consumers have not

1551
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:48,300
Speaker 6:  experienced yet. They will starting later this year with the new quest and

1552
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:52,020
Speaker 6:  apple. But like that, that changes the game. I did this demo of a

1553
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:55,740
Speaker 6:  contact lens where it used my eye movement to like do the

1554
01:31:55,740 --> 01:31:59,440
Speaker 6:  input and like go around the dial and select the directions. And like

1555
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:03,430
Speaker 6:  that stuff is wild. Like eye tracking com is going

1556
01:32:03,430 --> 01:32:06,760
Speaker 6:  to be very cool and it makes your avatar follow your face and your where

1557
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:09,970
Speaker 6:  you're looking and all that. So they will have that magic leap to does not

1558
01:32:09,970 --> 01:32:13,240
Speaker 6:  have that. So I do think from a spec perspective, these will be the best

1559
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:15,970
Speaker 6:  when they come out, but they're going to be expensive and they're going to

1560
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:18,190
Speaker 6:  be for early adopters and they're not going to sell that much.

1561
01:32:18,190 --> 01:32:21,880
Speaker 12:  I'm curious what the early adopter thing is going to is going to do because

1562
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:25,030
Speaker 12:  like glass tried that. And I think that's kind of one of the reasons why

1563
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:29,020
Speaker 12:  people hated glass so much because it was seen as this thing that you had

1564
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:33,010
Speaker 12:  these very small groups of super rich, early

1565
01:32:33,010 --> 01:32:36,250
Speaker 12:  adopter guys trying out, and they looked like jerks and you hated

1566
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:37,150
Speaker 12:  them

1567
01:32:37,150 --> 01:32:40,390
Speaker 5:  Glass holes, like what are we going to call these? Are these guys also going

1568
01:32:40,390 --> 01:32:42,850
Speaker 5:  to be called glass holes?

1569
01:32:42,850 --> 01:32:46,390
Speaker 1:  Well, the idea is that you won't know like glass was, I mean, this is my

1570
01:32:46,390 --> 01:32:50,230
Speaker 1:  favorite. So to start my class so many times glass looks so intense and it

1571
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:53,890
Speaker 1:  came with so much hype in that moment of hype that like

1572
01:32:53,890 --> 01:32:57,640
Speaker 1:  I went to the Indy 500 wearing Google glass. And like

1573
01:32:57,640 --> 01:33:00,940
Speaker 1:  people were like falling out of trailers in the infield and be like, can

1574
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:04,270
Speaker 1:  you see through clothes? And like, that was the thing that would have sold

1575
01:33:04,270 --> 01:33:07,900
Speaker 1:  what Google glass looked like to people like they were heartbroken when I

1576
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:11,440
Speaker 1:  was like, no, I can not see through clothes at best. It like

1577
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:15,430
Speaker 1:  lightly buzzes and takes a two megapixel photo,

1578
01:33:15,430 --> 01:33:18,970
Speaker 1:  like reach up to it. Like that's what it does. But I think you have to make

1579
01:33:18,970 --> 01:33:22,000
Speaker 1:  them look really normal, right? That's like, that's where everyone is headed

1580
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,080
Speaker 1:  with these. They have to look

1581
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:26,290
Speaker 6:  And to be clear, the first version of these there, there's going to be no

1582
01:33:26,290 --> 01:33:29,770
Speaker 6:  mistaking that you're doing have normal classes.

1583
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:31,960
Speaker 6:  So like,

1584
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:34,810
Speaker 1:  Well, this is a great story. We're obviously tracking this very closely.

1585
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:38,770
Speaker 1:  I'm I mean, this is the next generation of gadgets, right? Like

1586
01:33:38,770 --> 01:33:42,490
Speaker 1:  It's like folding phones and this and my, you know, one of my big

1587
01:33:42,490 --> 01:33:46,480
Speaker 1:  theses is that display technology drives the generations of

1588
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:49,450
Speaker 1:  gadgets. Like if you can predict this way, technology can predict the shape

1589
01:33:49,450 --> 01:33:52,810
Speaker 1:  of things. And that will like folding phones. Is that thing. I imagine Apple's

1590
01:33:52,810 --> 01:33:55,300
Speaker 1:  working in one of those too, right? Like it's just about that time for that

1591
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:59,170
Speaker 1:  to hit the mainstream and right next to it is can we make the display that

1592
01:33:59,170 --> 01:34:02,920
Speaker 1:  goes into your face? And I'm, I'm very curious to see how this plays out,

1593
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:06,460
Speaker 6:  Which will happen first Elan, making Twitter a

1594
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:09,430
Speaker 6:  bastion of free speech or really good displays for our

1595
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:12,390
Speaker 6:  face

1596
01:34:12,390 --> 01:34:14,080

1605
01:34:42,130 --> 01:34:46,030
Speaker 1:  big story on why crypto bridges are where all the hacks are. So if
