00:00:02,515 --> 00:00:05,925
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Audio over wifi.

3
00:00:06,385 --> 00:00:10,285
Speaker 2:  I'm your friend David Pierce and I am currently waiting on my breakfast order.

4
00:00:10,435 --> 00:00:14,085
Speaker 2:  That doesn't sound like big news, but as I've mentioned on the show before,

5
00:00:14,485 --> 00:00:18,405
Speaker 2:  whenever I get to a new city, I immediately go looking for like a handful

6
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:22,285
Speaker 2:  of staples, really great cup of coffee, really great donut, really great

7
00:00:22,285 --> 00:00:26,245
Speaker 2:  pizza is I think one I forgot to mention the last time. And a really great

8
00:00:26,335 --> 00:00:29,485
Speaker 2:  bacon, egg and cheese. I haven't really found one in this neighborhood, but

9
00:00:29,485 --> 00:00:33,365
Speaker 2:  there's this place that I'm at right now that is on the way to daycare

10
00:00:33,545 --> 00:00:37,365
Speaker 2:  for me, which means I walk by it like 40,000 times a week and they just

11
00:00:37,365 --> 00:00:41,085
Speaker 2:  got a new name, a new owner, a new chef, and a new menu including a

12
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:44,325
Speaker 2:  breakfast sandwich. I keep hearing good things. This would be huge for me.

13
00:00:44,635 --> 00:00:47,445
Speaker 2:  This is where I'm at in life as a breakfast sandwich would, would change

14
00:00:47,445 --> 00:00:51,325
Speaker 2:  things for me. So I ordered it. It was $8, which is a little high

15
00:00:51,345 --> 00:00:54,725
Speaker 2:  but manageable and we're gonna see how we do. Anyway, we have an awesome

16
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:58,325
Speaker 2:  show coming up for you today. We're gonna do two things. The first thing

17
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:01,485
Speaker 2:  we're gonna do is we're gonna talk about Sonos. There's a bunch of new Sonos

18
00:01:01,485 --> 00:01:04,685
Speaker 2:  here. Chris Welch reviewed it all. I have been wondering about the Sonos

19
00:01:04,685 --> 00:01:08,445
Speaker 2:  ace headphones forever and Chris has them. He's used them. He's tested

20
00:01:08,445 --> 00:01:11,765
Speaker 2:  them, he's reviewed them. We're gonna talk to him about it and maybe if we're

21
00:01:11,765 --> 00:01:15,605
Speaker 2:  lucky, hear how it went. We're also gonna talk about the new documentary

22
00:01:15,605 --> 00:01:19,285
Speaker 2:  about MoviePass. It's called MoviePass Movie Crashed and it tells the story

23
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:23,525
Speaker 2:  of one of the fastest growing tech companies of all time and also one of

24
00:01:23,525 --> 00:01:26,805
Speaker 2:  the fastest dying tech companies of all time. It's a really interesting story

25
00:01:26,805 --> 00:01:30,445
Speaker 2:  because it is kind of every tech story all rolled into

26
00:01:30,585 --> 00:01:34,325
Speaker 2:  one bundle of total chaos. We're gonna talk to the director and the

27
00:01:34,405 --> 00:01:37,925
Speaker 2:  CEO get the whole story. Super fun episode. We're also gonna do a hotline

28
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:42,005
Speaker 2:  question. Lots to do. All that is coming up in just a sec, but first I

29
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:45,925
Speaker 2:  hear my sandwich coming. I can smell my sandwich coming. I'm very excited.

30
00:01:46,115 --> 00:01:47,645
Speaker 2:  This is The Vergecast. We'll be right back.

31
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:06,085
Speaker 2:  will be going there between, you know, six and

32
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:49,925
Speaker 2:  So the new Sonos ace headphones are out there, $450.

33
00:03:50,055 --> 00:03:53,285
Speaker 2:  Chris Welch has been using them. There's also the Rome Bluetooth speaker,

34
00:03:53,285 --> 00:03:57,005
Speaker 2:  which I wanna talk about, but I'm particularly curious about the ace because

35
00:03:57,275 --> 00:04:00,605
Speaker 2:  there's just something really hard about doing a pair of headphones like

36
00:04:00,605 --> 00:04:04,405
Speaker 2:  this correctly. You look at something like the AirPods Max

37
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:08,445
Speaker 2:  or the Bose Quiet Comfort headphones and what you see over and over is

38
00:04:08,445 --> 00:04:12,125
Speaker 2:  that the combination of weight, battery life, overall

39
00:04:12,195 --> 00:04:15,485
Speaker 2:  comfort, sound quality, noise cancellation,

40
00:04:16,035 --> 00:04:19,845
Speaker 2:  easy connectivity, it's really hard to do all of those things simultaneously

41
00:04:20,115 --> 00:04:24,085
Speaker 2:  correctly at any price. Four $50 is a lot to spend on a pair of

42
00:04:24,085 --> 00:04:27,205
Speaker 2:  headphones, but a really great pair of headphones that does all of those

43
00:04:27,205 --> 00:04:31,165
Speaker 2:  things well is like the white whale and a lot of companies are getting

44
00:04:31,165 --> 00:04:34,965
Speaker 2:  closer and closer. This space is really exciting actually, but we

45
00:04:34,965 --> 00:04:38,325
Speaker 2:  haven't quite gotten there so I've been fascinated to know are the Sonos

46
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:42,245
Speaker 2:  ace the ones, did they get there? Are they Sonos C and are they

47
00:04:42,245 --> 00:04:46,205
Speaker 2:  just an awesome pair of headphones? Chris Welch has reviewed them, he knows

48
00:04:46,205 --> 00:04:49,205
Speaker 2:  this stuff better than anybody else. I know time to talk about it. Chris

49
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:50,205
Speaker 2:  Welch, welcome back.

50
00:04:50,575 --> 00:04:51,285
Speaker 5:  Hello. Hello.

51
00:04:51,935 --> 00:04:55,765
Speaker 2:  Sonos just continues to take up your whole life

52
00:04:55,825 --> 00:04:56,565
Speaker 2:  and existence.

53
00:04:56,945 --> 00:05:00,765
Speaker 5:  Yes. How you feeling? Good. We just got the review up of the new Ace,

54
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:04,765
Speaker 5:  as did many other publications and seems like it's a fairly positive vibe

55
00:05:04,985 --> 00:05:05,965
Speaker 5:  so far. Yeah,

56
00:05:05,965 --> 00:05:09,485
Speaker 2:  People seem to, people seem to like the thing. Yeah, I'm very curious how

57
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:12,045
Speaker 2:  you review a pair of headphones. I wanna get into the ace in particular,

58
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:15,925
Speaker 2:  but like walk me through a a a day in the life of a Chris

59
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:16,885
Speaker 2:  Welch headphone review.

60
00:05:17,285 --> 00:05:20,925
Speaker 5:  I mean, I've got my playlist of songs that I know so, so well

61
00:05:21,065 --> 00:05:24,125
Speaker 5:  and then I just, you know, write the subway, walk around New York, see how

62
00:05:24,145 --> 00:05:27,045
Speaker 5:  hot they get, yada yada. It's like very warm in New York City right now.

63
00:05:27,185 --> 00:05:31,085
Speaker 5:  So that's been fun. But you know, comfort, I try and wear 'em all day here

64
00:05:31,085 --> 00:05:34,605
Speaker 5:  at the office once or twice just to see how they wear over time, you know,

65
00:05:34,605 --> 00:05:37,685
Speaker 5:  like I've got glasses so I want to see how those do as far as like comfort

66
00:05:37,835 --> 00:05:40,165
Speaker 5:  goes. But yeah, nothing too crazy, you know?

67
00:05:40,235 --> 00:05:43,005
Speaker 2:  What are your favorite test songs? Like what's, what's at the top of that?

68
00:05:43,225 --> 00:05:43,845
Speaker 2:  Tester goes,

69
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:47,205
Speaker 5:  Oh God. I mean I'm like a big Dave Matthews band guy, so nice.

70
00:05:47,895 --> 00:05:49,205
Speaker 5:  Gotta go back to those albums.

71
00:05:49,255 --> 00:05:52,885
Speaker 2:  Which of the many jammy guitar parts can I hear? Yes, most clearly here.

72
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:53,405
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I love

73
00:05:53,405 --> 00:05:57,165
Speaker 5:  It. Exactly. So that's on there, but you know, yeah, there's Beatles,

74
00:05:57,205 --> 00:06:00,725
Speaker 5:  there's all sorts of stuff that I kind of just go through in cycle Between,

75
00:06:00,825 --> 00:06:03,525
Speaker 5:  but Okay. But yeah, these sound quite nice. I think they're kinda like in

76
00:06:03,525 --> 00:06:07,405
Speaker 5:  between the Sonys and the AirPods Max. There is some base to them,

77
00:06:07,705 --> 00:06:11,125
Speaker 5:  but yeah, they sound nice and warm and detailed and I don't really have any

78
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,645
Speaker 5:  complaints on that front. Is

79
00:06:12,645 --> 00:06:15,725
Speaker 2:  There I, I'm realizing I've never really known the answer to this question.

80
00:06:15,785 --> 00:06:18,965
Speaker 2:  Is there like a sono sound in the way that I feel like there is sort of a

81
00:06:18,965 --> 00:06:22,845
Speaker 2:  beat sound and to some extent there's kind of a Bose sound. Is

82
00:06:22,845 --> 00:06:26,485
Speaker 2:  there a sono sound with the ace or with just Sono stuff in general?

83
00:06:26,965 --> 00:06:29,285
Speaker 5:  I don't know. You know, they always like talk about how they have this like

84
00:06:29,285 --> 00:06:32,045
Speaker 5:  board of like sound experts who they like go to for every speaker and product

85
00:06:32,115 --> 00:06:35,365
Speaker 5:  that like gives them advice on how it should sound and the yada yada. So

86
00:06:35,365 --> 00:06:38,725
Speaker 5:  these are pretty clean, crisp, they're not like super base forward. Yeah,

87
00:06:38,725 --> 00:06:41,925
Speaker 5:  they're fairly balanced. Like there's no like profile that I can really like

88
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:45,485
Speaker 5:  tell so it's just, yeah, they're a good sounding pair of headphones. Okay.

89
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,925
Speaker 5:  But they're comfortable as hell. That's like the main thing about these.

90
00:06:47,925 --> 00:06:50,845
Speaker 5:  It's like, so the weight is like in between the AirPods Max and the Sonys,

91
00:06:50,985 --> 00:06:53,925
Speaker 5:  but yeah, they just wear so much lighter than the AirPods Max, you know,

92
00:06:54,245 --> 00:06:57,765
Speaker 5:  there's more plastic, which is fine for headphones I think, you know,

93
00:06:58,025 --> 00:07:00,685
Speaker 5:  you certainly can't overdo it when it comes to metal and I think that's what

94
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:04,765
Speaker 5:  we had for the AirPods Max. But yeah, they feel great on your head over

95
00:07:04,765 --> 00:07:08,645
Speaker 5:  long timeframes. Yeah, I think the AirPods Max, one thing I like about those

96
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:12,405
Speaker 5:  better is the fabric ear cushions. These were a bit hotter because they're

97
00:07:12,405 --> 00:07:15,365
Speaker 5:  like pleather. So in the summer and the spring, you know, you start to sweat

98
00:07:15,425 --> 00:07:18,805
Speaker 5:  and that makes a difference. But on the whole they are just way, way more

99
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:19,205
Speaker 5:  comfortable.

100
00:07:19,275 --> 00:07:22,405
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I was surprised actually by how comfortable you found them given that

101
00:07:22,405 --> 00:07:26,165
Speaker 2:  they are not like wildly heavier than say the

102
00:07:26,185 --> 00:07:29,925
Speaker 2:  the Bose quiet comforts but meaningfully heavier and I think

103
00:07:30,305 --> 00:07:34,085
Speaker 2:  the AirPods max for me in particular feel heavy on my head

104
00:07:34,145 --> 00:07:37,805
Speaker 2:  in a way that like the Bose ones, you never don't know you're wearing

105
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:41,365
Speaker 2:  headphones, but I don't sort of feel them like the gravity of them pulling

106
00:07:41,365 --> 00:07:44,645
Speaker 2:  down on my head with the AirPods Max, I very much do. Yeah. And I was worried

107
00:07:44,645 --> 00:07:47,565
Speaker 2:  this was gonna skew closer to that, but it sounds like at least in the way

108
00:07:47,565 --> 00:07:48,925
Speaker 2:  that they wear, they don't feel like that at all.

109
00:07:49,115 --> 00:07:52,845
Speaker 5:  Yeah, not at all. Super comfortable. The battery life is like 30 hours, so

110
00:07:53,085 --> 00:07:56,365
Speaker 5:  they last a long, long, long time say like on the hardware front they got

111
00:07:56,365 --> 00:07:59,925
Speaker 5:  it all right. Honestly. So for our first time out it's pretty impressive

112
00:08:00,025 --> 00:08:03,085
Speaker 5:  and the software features, you know, half of them work, which is why I gave

113
00:08:03,085 --> 00:08:06,845
Speaker 5:  them a seven. I think some other publications were a bit a bit

114
00:08:06,845 --> 00:08:07,245
Speaker 5:  kinder

115
00:08:07,615 --> 00:08:11,045
Speaker 2:  While we're on the hardware. I wanna talk about just the controls for a second

116
00:08:11,445 --> 00:08:15,405
Speaker 2:  in part because from the way you describe it, it sounds like Sonos got the,

117
00:08:15,585 --> 00:08:19,405
Speaker 2:  how you use these headphones while they're on your head thing almost

118
00:08:19,435 --> 00:08:22,565
Speaker 2:  Exactly right. Like this idea of there being one button that does everything

119
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:26,005
Speaker 2:  and then I think you, you slide the button to change the volume.

120
00:08:26,765 --> 00:08:30,565
Speaker 2:  I love that, that that seems fantastic. Like is that, is that as good as

121
00:08:30,565 --> 00:08:33,845
Speaker 2:  it seems to be in terms of actually like putting your hands up and using

122
00:08:33,985 --> 00:08:37,125
Speaker 2:  the thing? 'cause for me it's like I have the bows and it's just a bunch

123
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:40,885
Speaker 2:  of sort of samey feeling buttons and I've gotten pretty good at

124
00:08:40,885 --> 00:08:44,605
Speaker 2:  knowing which one is which. But I'm still, every time I put my hand up I

125
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:47,845
Speaker 2:  kind of like slide it down the cup to find the right hit and it seems like

126
00:08:47,975 --> 00:08:49,925
Speaker 2:  Sonos just like figured it out from the jump.

127
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:52,965
Speaker 5:  Yeah, no it's very good. The content key as it's called, I'm not sure about

128
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:56,245
Speaker 5:  the name. Yeah, it's a bad name, you know, bad name but it's great like,

129
00:08:56,645 --> 00:08:59,125
Speaker 5:  so it takes some time to get used to just like finding it and like sliding

130
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,685
Speaker 5:  it and like that difference, you don't wanna press when you slide that takes

131
00:09:01,685 --> 00:09:05,085
Speaker 5:  like one day to get used to. But on the whole, yeah it's very good. Like

132
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:08,165
Speaker 5:  compared to swipes on all these like Sony headphones and stuff and like the

133
00:09:08,425 --> 00:09:12,205
Speaker 5:  tab gestures, once you have gloves on, forget about it. So this kind of stuff

134
00:09:12,205 --> 00:09:15,445
Speaker 5:  works a lot better in my experience. So there's that button, there's a button

135
00:09:15,445 --> 00:09:17,845
Speaker 5:  for the noise cancellation mode and a power button and that's pretty much

136
00:09:17,845 --> 00:09:18,405
Speaker 5:  it. So

137
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:22,205
Speaker 2:  That feels right. I will say I am just adamantly against touch

138
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:25,805
Speaker 2:  pads on headphones. I just don't think they work, I just, it's just a bad

139
00:09:25,995 --> 00:09:29,485
Speaker 2:  user experience. I'm not, I'm, I'm out on it everywhere it exists. So I'm

140
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,565
Speaker 2:  very glad Sonos didn't do that.

141
00:09:30,745 --> 00:09:31,525
Speaker 5:  I'm with you. Yeah.

142
00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:35,565
Speaker 2:  Okay, so let's, let's talk about the TV audio swap thing because there are

143
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:39,325
Speaker 2:  a bunch of other interesting features that sort of are and are not here,

144
00:09:39,505 --> 00:09:43,125
Speaker 2:  but TV audio swap was the thing, right? Like if Sonos is going to

145
00:09:43,445 --> 00:09:46,565
Speaker 2:  convince you to buy these headphones, one is it's a Sonos product. Sonos

146
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:50,485
Speaker 2:  tends to make very good sounding products, but the TV audio swap is the thing.

147
00:09:50,835 --> 00:09:52,325
Speaker 2:  Tell me about your experience with this.

148
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:55,525
Speaker 5:  It's been mostly good. I had a few hiccups where it just like didn't work

149
00:09:55,665 --> 00:09:59,045
Speaker 5:  and someone just tells me it's a bug. Of course that'll be fixed soon, like

150
00:09:59,045 --> 00:10:01,965
Speaker 5:  so many other things that are coming soon. But on the whole, yeah like so

151
00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:05,005
Speaker 5:  you have an arc, you just go home, you come home, you turn in your tv, start

152
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,365
Speaker 5:  watching something and you hold down the content key for like two seconds

153
00:10:07,385 --> 00:10:10,725
Speaker 5:  and then it just beams it right over to your headphones and there's head

154
00:10:10,925 --> 00:10:14,765
Speaker 5:  tracking if you want that. So you can like, you know, move around and feel

155
00:10:14,765 --> 00:10:17,965
Speaker 5:  more immersed in your content. So it works for like anything plugged into

156
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:21,205
Speaker 5:  your tv, be like a gaming console which works super well, like surprisingly

157
00:10:21,225 --> 00:10:24,925
Speaker 5:  so. And it's just, yeah, a nice little private wave of watching TV

158
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,005
Speaker 5:  and whatever else you want.

159
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:30,445
Speaker 2:  Sonos seems to have this idea that it's for more than just

160
00:10:31,445 --> 00:10:35,365
Speaker 2:  watching something quietly while someone else doesn't want to

161
00:10:35,365 --> 00:10:38,805
Speaker 2:  watch it. Like right. For me, I, I used private listening on

162
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:42,445
Speaker 2:  Roku for months after I had a kid because you know, I have a, I have a kid

163
00:10:42,445 --> 00:10:46,245
Speaker 2:  in my arm and I'm wearing headphones and that is a way to

164
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:49,205
Speaker 2:  listen to things quietly. But I get the sense Sonos thinks of this as like

165
00:10:49,245 --> 00:10:52,725
Speaker 2:  a, like a lifestyle feature or as like an audio feature

166
00:10:53,475 --> 00:10:57,405
Speaker 2:  more than just, you can hear the audio but others can't. Like what,

167
00:10:57,435 --> 00:11:01,285
Speaker 2:  what is the big sort of Galaxy Brain case for audio swap and

168
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,765
Speaker 2:  why you would wear headphones to watch tv?

169
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,325
Speaker 5:  I think it can be more immersive. Like there's spatial audio, a surround

170
00:11:06,325 --> 00:11:09,485
Speaker 5:  sound, like they up convert stereo if you want that as well. So it does sound

171
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:09,925
Speaker 5:  really good

172
00:11:10,205 --> 00:11:13,325
Speaker 2:  I guess That's true. It's like a 5.1 system on your head. Yeah, that's fair.

173
00:11:13,325 --> 00:11:13,885
Speaker 2:  That's something

174
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:16,685
Speaker 5:  And so there's that and then this fall there's a new feature called True

175
00:11:16,685 --> 00:11:20,205
Speaker 5:  Cinema that's gonna like map your room using both the sound bar and the headphones.

176
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:24,085
Speaker 5:  So it sounds like more real, the surround sound effect, it'll like trick

177
00:11:24,085 --> 00:11:26,445
Speaker 5:  your brain into like actually thinking they're actually speakers around you

178
00:11:26,495 --> 00:11:30,205
Speaker 5:  Right now it's not quite that level but they say sometime this, this year

179
00:11:30,235 --> 00:11:33,845
Speaker 5:  that'll be there and Bose is also working on like similar ideas to like pair

180
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:37,565
Speaker 5:  soundbars and headphones and earbuds together for like super immersion.

181
00:11:37,985 --> 00:11:41,885
Speaker 5:  So once that rolls out, if it you know, works as advertised, that'll be

182
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:45,485
Speaker 5:  interesting. But yeah, it's like very immersive. It sounds very nice. You

183
00:11:45,485 --> 00:11:48,765
Speaker 5:  don't have to like sacrifice audio quality just to not have your soundbar

184
00:11:48,765 --> 00:11:51,965
Speaker 5:  blurring away at night, which is nice and you can game on it. Like I said,

185
00:11:52,685 --> 00:11:54,845
Speaker 5:  that's what what I've done a ton and it's great. What's

186
00:11:54,845 --> 00:11:58,565
Speaker 2:  Been your experience so far in terms of actually sitting down and doing it?

187
00:11:58,565 --> 00:12:01,525
Speaker 2:  Like obviously when you're reviewing the product you're gonna go through

188
00:12:01,525 --> 00:12:04,365
Speaker 2:  the work to sit down on the couch, grab the remote, grab your headphones,

189
00:12:04,665 --> 00:12:08,245
Speaker 2:  do the whole thing. Do you think it as just a normal person in normal life

190
00:12:08,505 --> 00:12:12,045
Speaker 2:  you you're gonna add headphones to the flop down on the couch mix?

191
00:12:12,405 --> 00:12:15,045
Speaker 5:  I think so. I've got roommates so that's the main thing. Like what's that

192
00:12:15,045 --> 00:12:18,445
Speaker 5:  real really late at night, I'm not gonna like have my arc going full blast

193
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:21,885
Speaker 5:  while watching, you know, a top gun maverick. It's not

194
00:12:22,095 --> 00:12:24,925
Speaker 5:  super considerate. So that's there, that's a use case, you know, late night

195
00:12:24,925 --> 00:12:28,325
Speaker 5:  gaming, yada yada past a certain point of night. It's like a super handy

196
00:12:28,325 --> 00:12:32,205
Speaker 5:  thing to have and it sounds very nice for sure. So is it worth the cost of

197
00:12:32,205 --> 00:12:35,485
Speaker 5:  the headphones and an arc? You know, that's a pricey thing

198
00:12:35,845 --> 00:12:39,805
Speaker 2:  I think in that case the key is to try and convince everyone in the house

199
00:12:39,865 --> 00:12:42,805
Speaker 2:  to split it. Yeah and it's like listen this is not for me, this is for all

200
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:46,365
Speaker 2:  of us. It, it will be mine and I will own it and you can't use it but it

201
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:50,245
Speaker 2:  is for all of us and so this like what $1,100

202
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:52,805
Speaker 2:  purchase, we're just gonna split it together, it's gonna be no problem.

203
00:12:53,195 --> 00:12:56,045
Speaker 5:  Yeah but it should, should be coming to the Ray and the beam pretty soon

204
00:12:56,045 --> 00:12:58,445
Speaker 5:  and it's cool for the Ray 'cause like the rays just like a basic like stereo

205
00:12:58,725 --> 00:13:02,325
Speaker 5:  soundbar but now you're gonna get like Dolby atmos like res surround sound

206
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:05,165
Speaker 5:  through your headphones, which is nice to, nice to see. But yeah, like once

207
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:09,005
Speaker 5:  they roll out that support, once TV audio swap works on Android at all, that'll

208
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:12,005
Speaker 5:  be a nice thing. So I think I'm gonna like go back and like readdress the

209
00:13:12,005 --> 00:13:15,565
Speaker 5:  score once some of these software updates go out for more people.

210
00:13:15,715 --> 00:13:16,005
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

211
00:13:16,025 --> 00:13:19,805
Speaker 2:  So it's the once it works thing that is killing me here. Right, because the,

212
00:13:19,835 --> 00:13:23,525
Speaker 2:  this is, this is the story of Sonos these last few weeks is

213
00:13:24,065 --> 00:13:26,965
Speaker 2:  it rolled out this half finished app

214
00:13:27,965 --> 00:13:31,885
Speaker 2:  supposedly in order to support these headphones which themselves don't

215
00:13:31,885 --> 00:13:34,965
Speaker 2:  feel finished from a software perspective. And on the one hand if you want

216
00:13:34,965 --> 00:13:37,765
Speaker 2:  to pick a weakness of Sonos, it has always been its software. So I guess

217
00:13:37,765 --> 00:13:40,765
Speaker 2:  on the, I I shouldn't be totally shocked that it seems like it nailed the

218
00:13:40,925 --> 00:13:43,765
Speaker 2:  hardware and didn't finish the software. Like that is kind of a Sonos story.

219
00:13:44,545 --> 00:13:48,205
Speaker 2:  But on the other hand I just can't stop thinking like wh why why

220
00:13:48,445 --> 00:13:52,085
Speaker 2:  ship any of this A now and B in this order

221
00:13:52,235 --> 00:13:56,205
Speaker 2:  when it doesn't seem like there was any real like rhyme or reason

222
00:13:56,505 --> 00:13:57,765
Speaker 2:  and none of it's done. I

223
00:13:57,765 --> 00:14:00,045
Speaker 5:  Don't understand the whole June timeframe thing. Yeah I think maybe like

224
00:14:00,045 --> 00:14:03,085
Speaker 5:  there like thinking like Apple's gonna have new AirPods in the fall that

225
00:14:03,085 --> 00:14:06,005
Speaker 5:  would just drown out this if they waited until you know September. But even

226
00:14:06,005 --> 00:14:08,925
Speaker 5:  like waiting until August would've given them like precious weeks to just

227
00:14:08,925 --> 00:14:12,765
Speaker 5:  polish everything a little bit more and get it out the door as a fuller

228
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:16,885
Speaker 5:  thing. Yeah it's just a big rush and it's not clear why, I mean people

229
00:14:16,885 --> 00:14:19,125
Speaker 5:  aren't like buying speakers and sound bars like they were during the pandemic.

230
00:14:19,145 --> 00:14:22,925
Speaker 5:  So that's the main like impetus for these coming out in the first place.

231
00:14:23,225 --> 00:14:23,445
Speaker 5:  Is

232
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:27,325
Speaker 2:  Sonos a little peloton in that way? Do you think that like

233
00:14:27,515 --> 00:14:31,085
Speaker 2:  it's a great product that is always going to be kind of a niche

234
00:14:31,255 --> 00:14:35,005
Speaker 2:  thing just by virtue of A what it is and B, what it costs and

235
00:14:35,355 --> 00:14:39,245
Speaker 2:  everybody who was gonna get one got one which is great

236
00:14:39,585 --> 00:14:42,685
Speaker 2:  but now puts you in a position of like there, there probably aren't many

237
00:14:42,685 --> 00:14:45,525
Speaker 2:  people out there right now shopping for Sonos upgrades because everybody

238
00:14:45,525 --> 00:14:49,325
Speaker 2:  upgraded in 2020 and 2021. So now if I'm Sonos

239
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:53,205
Speaker 2:  like is the whole headphones push just we need a

240
00:14:53,415 --> 00:14:57,325
Speaker 2:  whole new thing to give people so that they're not upgrading, they're

241
00:14:57,445 --> 00:14:58,965
Speaker 2:  actually buying like a net new object.

242
00:14:59,235 --> 00:15:02,125
Speaker 5:  Yeah, for sure. Okay. That's the main reason behind this. They've also got

243
00:15:02,285 --> 00:15:05,485
Speaker 5:  services, you know they, they've got Sonos radio, hd, other Sonos Pro for

244
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:08,245
Speaker 5:  businesses or they like manage all your speakers so they're all trying to

245
00:15:08,245 --> 00:15:11,725
Speaker 5:  branch out and find like new ways of more income. But yeah like you said

246
00:15:11,725 --> 00:15:14,765
Speaker 5:  like you know, I've had an arc it would take a lot for me to like upgrade

247
00:15:14,845 --> 00:15:17,885
Speaker 5:  a soundbar. Like there's not much this, this thing doesn't do that I would

248
00:15:17,885 --> 00:15:21,125
Speaker 5:  need from some new version, you know, same goes for the play five which has

249
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,605
Speaker 5:  been around forever. So these are first and you can see like a world where

250
00:15:23,605 --> 00:15:26,845
Speaker 5:  they do you know like not just headphones but also ear buds and kinda like

251
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:30,125
Speaker 5:  you know, do the full thing and this is a good start. There are four 50 bucks

252
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,685
Speaker 5:  which is, that's a lot of money but people, people spend a lot on this stuff.

253
00:15:33,745 --> 00:15:36,885
Speaker 5:  So Sony and Bose and everybody else, you know they're all in the same territory

254
00:15:36,905 --> 00:15:40,005
Speaker 5:  but yeah for a first time out, you know, super impressive. I think they've

255
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:43,565
Speaker 5:  got a lot of bugs to work out. The app is still a causing chaos.

256
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:48,365
Speaker 5:  I mean the Sonos subreddit is just, I've never seen anything like it just

257
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:51,325
Speaker 5:  every day still still people venting, which I understand, you know, people

258
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:55,245
Speaker 5:  lose features. I'd be upset too, like I'm with Neli and you and I don't

259
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:59,165
Speaker 5:  really use my Sona system that way or I've noticed much different but yeah

260
00:15:59,165 --> 00:16:01,725
Speaker 5:  they should have just waited one or two more months, put all this stuff out

261
00:16:01,745 --> 00:16:05,565
Speaker 5:  in the fall and had a way smoother experience that like didn't cause

262
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:06,725
Speaker 5:  cause the huge outcry.

263
00:16:06,955 --> 00:16:10,485
Speaker 2:  Yeah I think to some extent Sonos is lucky it got the hardware as right as

264
00:16:10,485 --> 00:16:13,845
Speaker 2:  it did because it'll, it'll buy it a chance to do that. Like I think

265
00:16:14,325 --> 00:16:18,125
Speaker 2:  if if there had been even one kind of big

266
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:22,045
Speaker 2:  flaw in the hardware on top of all the stuff with the app, yeah

267
00:16:22,075 --> 00:16:25,845
Speaker 2:  this would feel almost dead on arrival. Whereas now it's like okay

268
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:29,965
Speaker 2:  I think there's a reasonable chance that come this fall or like this holiday

269
00:16:30,035 --> 00:16:32,365
Speaker 2:  when a lot of people are Christmas shopping, this is going to be a damn good

270
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:34,445
Speaker 2:  pair of headphones. Yeah, absolutely. That is actually gonna make a lot of

271
00:16:34,445 --> 00:16:37,685
Speaker 2:  sense for a lot of people. I will say the thing about it that kills me, the

272
00:16:37,685 --> 00:16:41,405
Speaker 2:  sort of dream that I think a lot of people have had for a Sonos pair of headphones

273
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:45,525
Speaker 2:  and what I'm seeing a lot of in our comments too on your review is this

274
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:49,405
Speaker 2:  idea that it should fit perfectly into my whole Sonos

275
00:16:49,405 --> 00:16:53,325
Speaker 2:  ecosystem, right? That I should I, I want to listen to music on

276
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:57,285
Speaker 2:  the speaker in my kitchen while I make dinner and then pop on headphones

277
00:16:57,385 --> 00:17:01,245
Speaker 2:  and just boom the music switches, everything works great and

278
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:05,085
Speaker 2:  then I can play from you know, my, my record player and the

279
00:17:05,145 --> 00:17:09,005
Speaker 2:  TV in my living room and the TV upstairs and everything that is in

280
00:17:09,005 --> 00:17:12,005
Speaker 2:  the Sonos ecosystem just sort of beautifully flows around and this has been

281
00:17:12,005 --> 00:17:15,725
Speaker 2:  the promise of Sonos for forever. Yeah and the ace just doesn't

282
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:19,805
Speaker 2:  feel like it comes anywhere close to that. Like the the content key

283
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:22,485
Speaker 2:  thing you're describing where it sits down and it works at the Ace, I am

284
00:17:22,485 --> 00:17:25,525
Speaker 2:  confident that will eventually work very well. I could be wrong about that,

285
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,885
Speaker 2:  but it seems like that that is the sort of thing Sonos will eventually get

286
00:17:28,885 --> 00:17:32,125
Speaker 2:  right because it usually eventually gets that kind of stuff right. But it

287
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,405
Speaker 2:  doesn't seem like there's any indication that this is going to be the like

288
00:17:34,995 --> 00:17:38,885
Speaker 2:  magical addition to my whole Sonos system that

289
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:39,645
Speaker 2:  I wanted it to be.

290
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:43,165
Speaker 5:  It's funny you should say that last week they had like a Reddit ask me anything

291
00:17:43,445 --> 00:17:46,325
Speaker 5:  where people have asked about this a ton and so they, they kind of said like

292
00:17:46,325 --> 00:17:49,685
Speaker 5:  we're just not there yet as far as the tech goes. So in terms of like CPU

293
00:17:49,685 --> 00:17:52,765
Speaker 5:  power, these have a fraction of even like the Sonos room, oh like it's a

294
00:17:53,015 --> 00:17:56,445
Speaker 5:  small processor in there, then there's wifi to worry about battery

295
00:17:56,555 --> 00:17:59,845
Speaker 5:  worries and so they're like, we tried it like we prototyped those wifi

296
00:18:00,015 --> 00:18:03,245
Speaker 5:  headphones that everybody wants and they sucked so like we're just not there

297
00:18:03,245 --> 00:18:07,005
Speaker 5:  yet as far as like being able to do that and like have it be viable. Like

298
00:18:07,005 --> 00:18:10,445
Speaker 5:  they were like we, they were like we tried it and it's just not the right

299
00:18:10,445 --> 00:18:13,965
Speaker 5:  time right now. So this is like a first step I think and it makes sense,

300
00:18:13,965 --> 00:18:17,645
Speaker 5:  it's like a, you know, halfway point between full on like Sonos integration

301
00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:20,885
Speaker 5:  and what we have now with the TV audio swap. So it's a good starting point

302
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:24,245
Speaker 5:  but I can see the point of like, you know, do you really want like a short

303
00:18:24,245 --> 00:18:27,925
Speaker 5:  battery life just for wifi audio? I mean I would sometimes but you know give

304
00:18:27,925 --> 00:18:31,445
Speaker 5:  it like two or three, four years maybe we'll see that kind of product eventually.

305
00:18:31,705 --> 00:18:32,125
Speaker 5:  That's

306
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:35,845
Speaker 2:  Fair. And I will say to Sonos is credit making a thing that is fundamentally

307
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:39,125
Speaker 2:  just a very good pair of Bluetooth headphones is the right thing and not

308
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:43,005
Speaker 2:  something Sonos historically always does. So like making a thing that

309
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:47,085
Speaker 2:  actually easily works with all of your non Sonos stuff is a victory.

310
00:18:47,305 --> 00:18:50,125
Speaker 2:  So I think if you, if you're forcing me to choose, I will take what they

311
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:54,045
Speaker 2:  did but it does it, it just feels like there's that little piece of sort

312
00:18:54,045 --> 00:18:57,925
Speaker 2:  of Sonos magic that nothing else can get to that it didn't

313
00:18:58,015 --> 00:19:01,685
Speaker 2:  quite hit and that bummed me out. Yeah, from an audio perspective,

314
00:19:02,035 --> 00:19:06,005
Speaker 2:  does the wifi thing matter? I I just like sincerely don't know how much I

315
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:09,965
Speaker 2:  should care that I can't do wifi audio versus just having the, you

316
00:19:09,965 --> 00:19:12,525
Speaker 2:  know, Bluetooth codec support from my phone. There

317
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:14,685
Speaker 5:  Are always gonna be people who like swear they can tell the difference between

318
00:19:14,685 --> 00:19:18,405
Speaker 5:  lossless audio and you know like all these codecs. I can tell maybe

319
00:19:18,405 --> 00:19:21,405
Speaker 5:  sometimes it's just one of those things people just like want to have 'cause

320
00:19:21,405 --> 00:19:24,245
Speaker 5:  they're spending all that money, I think they just want the best thing and

321
00:19:24,245 --> 00:19:27,405
Speaker 5:  so it makes sense to want that doesn't really matter. It's gonna really come

322
00:19:27,405 --> 00:19:30,005
Speaker 5:  down to like each person individually I can see like why you would want it

323
00:19:30,005 --> 00:19:33,165
Speaker 5:  as far as like a turntable in your system and like an amp and like having

324
00:19:33,195 --> 00:19:35,845
Speaker 5:  like play that through your headphones. That'd be awesome. But unfortunately

325
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:39,005
Speaker 5:  we're not there quite yet. But like yeah these sound very good. They're good

326
00:19:39,005 --> 00:19:41,845
Speaker 5:  headphones. So they've got several features that like all these high-end

327
00:19:41,845 --> 00:19:44,605
Speaker 5:  headphones usually do. There's like on head detection so you can like take

328
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:47,805
Speaker 5:  'em off, it'll pause all those like you know like the small quality of life

329
00:19:47,805 --> 00:19:50,685
Speaker 5:  things and there's multi points. You compare them with two devices at once

330
00:19:50,745 --> 00:19:53,485
Speaker 5:  and so they've covered a lot of ground. There's like wired USBC listening,

331
00:19:53,785 --> 00:19:57,045
Speaker 5:  so if you want lossless audio there's your answer. So yeah, they've covered

332
00:19:57,085 --> 00:20:00,245
Speaker 5:  a lot of ground but now we're in this like weird game of wait and see for

333
00:20:00,245 --> 00:20:04,045
Speaker 5:  like the Android support and the Beam and the ray and, but that

334
00:20:04,045 --> 00:20:06,765
Speaker 5:  stuff should shake out like Sonas promises, software fixes and they usually

335
00:20:06,765 --> 00:20:09,685
Speaker 5:  do make good on actually you know, putting them out. So yeah, we'll see how

336
00:20:09,685 --> 00:20:13,245
Speaker 5:  long it takes hopefully this month for some of this stuff but there's no

337
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,165
Speaker 5:  firm timetable just yet. So yeah

338
00:20:15,165 --> 00:20:18,645
Speaker 2:  It does seem like audio quality wise I feel like the, the gold standard is

339
00:20:18,645 --> 00:20:22,565
Speaker 2:  like whatever new Sony hexa decimal

340
00:20:22,565 --> 00:20:26,365
Speaker 2:  thing, I can't remember the name of thing. The new Bose Quiet

341
00:20:26,365 --> 00:20:30,005
Speaker 2:  Comforts and the AirPods Max. I feel like that's kind of like the trio everybody

342
00:20:30,005 --> 00:20:30,365
Speaker 2:  thinks of.

343
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:33,005
Speaker 5:  There are some others and there you know there's the Asen Heiser, momentum

344
00:20:33,255 --> 00:20:36,845
Speaker 5:  fours, those sound great. Those are probably my favorite sound quality headphones.

345
00:20:36,845 --> 00:20:39,565
Speaker 5:  Besides these at the moment there's that and I call these brands like Bowers

346
00:20:39,565 --> 00:20:43,405
Speaker 5:  and Wilkins for like that true like audio file segment. But like by and large,

347
00:20:43,405 --> 00:20:46,885
Speaker 5:  like you said like for most consumers it's Sony, it's Bose, it's Apple,

348
00:20:47,265 --> 00:20:49,765
Speaker 5:  and now hopefully Sonos is what they want to happen.

349
00:20:50,035 --> 00:20:53,805
Speaker 2:  Well and it seems like from a sort of what it's like to wear

350
00:20:53,945 --> 00:20:57,445
Speaker 2:  and use and listen to them, yeah Sonos belongs there

351
00:20:57,945 --> 00:21:00,205
Speaker 2:  but I feel like the one other piece of that we haven't talked about is the

352
00:21:00,205 --> 00:21:04,085
Speaker 2:  noise cancellation, which to me I think is like maybe the most important

353
00:21:04,085 --> 00:21:07,645
Speaker 2:  feature for me, like this is where I out myself as somebody who is like by

354
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:11,365
Speaker 2:  no means an audio quality expert. Yeah. But somebody who is constantly on

355
00:21:11,365 --> 00:21:15,325
Speaker 2:  planes, the A NC really matters to me, which is why I've been a, a real

356
00:21:15,515 --> 00:21:19,045
Speaker 2:  like Bose loyalist over the years because Bose is just better at this than

357
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:21,085
Speaker 2:  everybody else. How do the ace shape up there?

358
00:21:21,915 --> 00:21:24,885
Speaker 5:  Bose is still better than everybody else, but these are good, you know, they're

359
00:21:24,885 --> 00:21:27,925
Speaker 5:  not like top tier level but they're good enough for a plane ride or the train.

360
00:21:27,945 --> 00:21:30,885
Speaker 5:  You know, I've, I've had 'em on the past two weeks and they're good for the

361
00:21:30,885 --> 00:21:34,125
Speaker 5:  subway. My coffee shop, I can still hear like a little bit of racket when

362
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,845
Speaker 5:  I work from the coffee shop on my block, but, so they're not like BS level

363
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:40,525
Speaker 5:  of like a total cocoon of silence but for most like everyday

364
00:21:40,525 --> 00:21:43,965
Speaker 5:  situations where you just wanna like have some peace and quiet, it'll do

365
00:21:43,965 --> 00:21:45,125
Speaker 5:  the job just fine. What

366
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:48,165
Speaker 2:  About the flip side? The, what is it called? The, the like audio pass through

367
00:21:48,165 --> 00:21:51,205
Speaker 2:  thing where it tries to pump in the outside noise? How is that?

368
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:54,645
Speaker 5:  That sounds actually very, very good. Okay. That's like the AirPods max have

369
00:21:54,645 --> 00:21:57,845
Speaker 5:  the best pass through mode of all and these are like not too far behind that

370
00:21:58,165 --> 00:21:58,685
Speaker 5:  honestly. Oh

371
00:21:58,685 --> 00:21:59,125
Speaker 2:  Wow, okay.

372
00:21:59,155 --> 00:22:01,805
Speaker 5:  It's like that's where someone else really came through and kind of surprised

373
00:22:01,805 --> 00:22:02,285
Speaker 5:  me because

374
00:22:02,285 --> 00:22:05,765
Speaker 2:  The Air Budds Maxs are drastically better than the Bose. Yeah

375
00:22:05,765 --> 00:22:08,725
Speaker 5:  Those are great. These are, you know, like a stones throw away pretty close

376
00:22:08,865 --> 00:22:12,245
Speaker 5:  and then BS and the Sony are not, not so hot when it comes to the pass through

377
00:22:12,245 --> 00:22:15,885
Speaker 5:  mode. But yeah, so it's not world class A NC but it's close on on the

378
00:22:15,885 --> 00:22:19,045
Speaker 5:  transparency mode front. So pretty good All in all. So it

379
00:22:19,045 --> 00:22:22,605
Speaker 2:  Seems like even if you're not a Sonos person and you're just

380
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:26,205
Speaker 2:  wanting to buy a really good pair of headphones to pair with your

381
00:22:26,565 --> 00:22:29,005
Speaker 2:  computer and phone and whatever, if you don't have any other Sonos gear,

382
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:33,565
Speaker 2:  this is probably like a hundred dollars more than you wanna spend on this

383
00:22:33,565 --> 00:22:37,525
Speaker 2:  pair of headphones, right? But like absolutely belongs on the poke

384
00:22:37,525 --> 00:22:40,725
Speaker 2:  around the Amazon listing. Yeah. Set. Is that, is that a fair

385
00:22:40,725 --> 00:22:41,925
Speaker 2:  characterization? Yeah

386
00:22:41,925 --> 00:22:44,685
Speaker 5:  For surely. I don't know who's gonna start their Sonos journey with headphones

387
00:22:44,685 --> 00:22:47,805
Speaker 5:  that cost this much, but I'm sure some people will, you know, there'll be

388
00:22:47,845 --> 00:22:51,485
Speaker 5:  a person who just buys these and then thinks these are great and buys a,

389
00:22:51,485 --> 00:22:54,365
Speaker 5:  you know, the whole, the arc obviously you would get first if you wanna actually

390
00:22:55,105 --> 00:22:58,645
Speaker 5:  use the core feature. But yeah, I mean they're great. Like they belong the

391
00:22:58,645 --> 00:23:02,485
Speaker 5:  same conversation as everybody else as far as like sound quality fit

392
00:23:02,485 --> 00:23:05,485
Speaker 5:  and finish and comfort, like I said, the comfort is really, you know, go

393
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:08,565
Speaker 5:  to your local Best Buy and trys and you're gonna be pretty surprised by how

394
00:23:08,565 --> 00:23:09,285
Speaker 5:  good they feel. I think

395
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,405
Speaker 2:  It's a big win for Sonos honestly. Especially if you go back to that like

396
00:23:12,855 --> 00:23:16,765
Speaker 2:  Sonos has to find the thing to sell people who don't want sono skier. Right.

397
00:23:16,765 --> 00:23:20,405
Speaker 2:  That's a big win And I, I would bet I could be totally wrong, but I would

398
00:23:20,425 --> 00:23:23,445
Speaker 2:  bet that we're gonna get to like Black Friday and this thing is gonna be

399
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:24,525
Speaker 2:  $349.

400
00:23:24,825 --> 00:23:28,485
Speaker 5:  That'd be nice. That would help for sure. But even now they're great. I think

401
00:23:28,485 --> 00:23:31,205
Speaker 5:  the white one are my, my favorite compared to the black and the black is

402
00:23:31,205 --> 00:23:32,085
Speaker 5:  fine, but the

403
00:23:32,085 --> 00:23:34,485
Speaker 2:  White one's are really nice looking. Yeah, they're really nice looking.

404
00:23:34,745 --> 00:23:36,605
Speaker 5:  So that's the way I would go if someone wants advice,

405
00:23:36,735 --> 00:23:40,045
Speaker 2:  Which ones have you been testing the most? The white ones I worry would get

406
00:23:40,155 --> 00:23:44,085
Speaker 2:  sort of a like gross patina on them after wearing 'em for a

407
00:23:44,085 --> 00:23:44,805
Speaker 2:  while. Yeah,

408
00:23:45,305 --> 00:23:48,645
Speaker 5:  So far they still look good. Okay. The case is getting pretty, pretty dirty,

409
00:23:48,925 --> 00:23:52,445
Speaker 5:  the white case, but it's got a nice green interior so you know, the black

410
00:23:52,445 --> 00:23:55,125
Speaker 5:  ones get all smudgy, they've got like an anti fingerprint coating on them

411
00:23:55,385 --> 00:23:58,205
Speaker 5:  to help with that a little bit, but they still pick up smudges and stuff

412
00:23:58,205 --> 00:24:02,045
Speaker 5:  like all black plastic gadgets tend to do, but personal preference

413
00:24:02,225 --> 00:24:03,165
Speaker 5:  as always. Yeah

414
00:24:03,165 --> 00:24:06,645
Speaker 2:  I will say for, for all of the kind of missing

415
00:24:07,055 --> 00:24:11,005
Speaker 2:  Sonos stuff, I'm very impressed that Sonos did as well as it did here. Yeah.

416
00:24:11,005 --> 00:24:14,685
Speaker 2:  Just to make this good a pair of headphones just absent all the other stuff,

417
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:18,125
Speaker 2:  just this good a pair of headphones on its first try outta the gate gives

418
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:21,165
Speaker 2:  me great hope for what Sonos might be able to do here. Pretty

419
00:24:21,165 --> 00:24:25,125
Speaker 5:  Good. I think Patrick Spence's job is safe for now after Just

420
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:28,645
Speaker 2:  Kidding. I mean gimme a couple app updates until I feel very confident about

421
00:24:28,645 --> 00:24:32,285
Speaker 2:  that, but I, I, I like the thought so far. I also forgot

422
00:24:32,545 --> 00:24:36,165
Speaker 2:  one other ace question that I forgot to ask. We're gonna come on and we're

423
00:24:36,165 --> 00:24:40,045
Speaker 2:  gonna do a full fancy headphone mic test at some point because that's a thing

424
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:43,845
Speaker 2:  we need to do. The people love when we put horrible sounding audio on The

425
00:24:43,925 --> 00:24:46,085
Speaker 2:  Vergecast, we, and we haven't done it in a while Chris, and we're gonna have

426
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:49,725
Speaker 2:  to do it, but give the, gimme the quick feeling of how the

427
00:24:49,725 --> 00:24:51,005
Speaker 2:  microphone is on the ace.

428
00:24:51,385 --> 00:24:54,765
Speaker 5:  Pretty good, pretty good. If you go to the review, there's an embed of me

429
00:24:54,925 --> 00:24:57,205
Speaker 5:  testing them that I put out today. We've

430
00:24:57,205 --> 00:25:00,925
Speaker 6:  Got the Sonos Save here in New York trying to give you a sense of

431
00:25:01,025 --> 00:25:05,005
Speaker 6:  how they sound, how clear they are and whether they're suitable for

432
00:25:05,015 --> 00:25:08,365
Speaker 6:  phone calls on the go. So let me know what you think.

433
00:25:09,085 --> 00:25:12,565
Speaker 5:  They're clear. I'm not one to like really take calls outside, I just don't

434
00:25:12,565 --> 00:25:15,445
Speaker 5:  enjoy it for myself or the other person on the line, so I try to avoid it,

435
00:25:15,445 --> 00:25:18,245
Speaker 5:  but sometimes, you know, you're at the coffee shop on a Zoom call and these

436
00:25:18,245 --> 00:25:21,125
Speaker 5:  seem like they'll work just fine. They do a decent job of like canceling

437
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:24,485
Speaker 5:  out background noise and all that and you come through clearly. So I'm not

438
00:25:24,485 --> 00:25:26,765
Speaker 5:  sure what else you would really ask for beyond that. So

439
00:25:26,765 --> 00:25:30,725
Speaker 2:  Before I let you go, you also have the new Rome, the new Bluetooth speaker.

440
00:25:30,725 --> 00:25:33,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah. You haven't published your review. That's coming later this week. Gimme

441
00:25:33,885 --> 00:25:34,925
Speaker 2:  a preview. How do you feel so far?

442
00:25:35,645 --> 00:25:39,605
Speaker 5:  They added a button that's really the, that's really what it comes down to.

443
00:25:40,465 --> 00:25:44,365
Speaker 5:  Yes, so the first Jerome had a combined power and Bluetooth pairing button

444
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:47,645
Speaker 5:  and you had to set it up at home first before you could use it as a portable

445
00:25:47,645 --> 00:25:50,405
Speaker 5:  speaker, which never made any sense. So they fixed that. You can use it outta

446
00:25:50,405 --> 00:25:53,765
Speaker 5:  the box now. Whoops. You do. But yeah, there's a new button. It sounds the

447
00:25:53,765 --> 00:25:56,445
Speaker 5:  exact same, so if you've heard it before, you've heard this one. Battery

448
00:25:56,445 --> 00:25:59,965
Speaker 5:  life is the same, some people haven't like had the best time with the room

449
00:25:59,965 --> 00:26:03,245
Speaker 5:  over time. I guess the battery ages not so well. So someone has told me that

450
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:06,645
Speaker 5:  they've done some work there to make it last longer, but yeah, it's the same

451
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:10,525
Speaker 5:  speaker as before, same price, just a new button comes in colors. It's

452
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:13,765
Speaker 5:  small, it's a good bathroom speaker. That's how I use mine for the shower.

453
00:26:14,025 --> 00:26:17,445
Speaker 5:  But yeah, it's not my top tier favorite Sono Skagit

454
00:26:17,595 --> 00:26:20,925
Speaker 2:  Fair. But it, I mean buttons are good. We here on the Vergecast, we believe

455
00:26:20,925 --> 00:26:23,045
Speaker 2:  in buttons. You know this so I I will take it.

456
00:26:23,355 --> 00:26:24,445
Speaker 5:  Love buttons. Yes.

457
00:26:24,785 --> 00:26:27,845
Speaker 2:  All right, well it's very upsetting that I wanna buy one of these now and

458
00:26:27,845 --> 00:26:30,805
Speaker 2:  I will not forgive you for that. I also wanna buy an ace now I like don't

459
00:26:30,805 --> 00:26:34,685
Speaker 2:  have a sound bar and all of a sudden I'm like, oh, $1,200 is a

460
00:26:34,685 --> 00:26:38,405
Speaker 2:  perfectly rational amount of money to spend upgrading my TV audio today.

461
00:26:38,405 --> 00:26:40,365
Speaker 2:  Like what? What could possibly go wrong? There's

462
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:44,245
Speaker 5:  The arc and there's an arc too coming and even like a higher end sound. They're

463
00:26:44,245 --> 00:26:46,885
Speaker 5:  working on so many, I don't, don't tell me this so much down the pipeline,

464
00:26:46,885 --> 00:26:49,285
Speaker 5:  Chris, this is not helpful. All right,

465
00:26:49,385 --> 00:26:52,885
Speaker 2:  We gotta take a break and then we're gonna be right back to talk about MoviePass.

466
00:26:53,215 --> 00:26:54,565
Speaker 2:  Chris, thank you as always.

467
00:30:18,005 --> 00:30:20,005
Speaker 2:  7 0 9 9. Just in case you're

468
00:31:07,885 --> 00:31:11,165
Speaker 2:  day. That was it. Those were all the rules, at least for a while. It was

469
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:15,085
Speaker 2:  a great product for anyone who likes watching movies and it was a

470
00:31:15,095 --> 00:31:19,045
Speaker 2:  truly horrific business. It took less than two years

471
00:31:19,145 --> 00:31:23,085
Speaker 2:  for the company to burn through $250 million and shut down

472
00:31:23,085 --> 00:31:26,525
Speaker 2:  the product entirely, which is honestly in a certain way, kind of

473
00:31:26,575 --> 00:31:30,325
Speaker 2:  impressive. Anyway, there's a new documentary out now on Max

474
00:31:30,325 --> 00:31:33,965
Speaker 2:  called MoviePass Movie Crash and it tells the story of

475
00:31:33,965 --> 00:31:35,685
Speaker 2:  MoviePass. No, it was

476
00:31:35,785 --> 00:31:39,645
Speaker 8:  The greatest thing ever. MoviePass MoviePass MoviePass,

477
00:31:39,905 --> 00:31:43,205
Speaker 8:  the popular movie ticket app, MoviePass, we remember them.

478
00:31:43,885 --> 00:31:44,965
Speaker 8:  Whatever happened to those guys?

479
00:31:46,035 --> 00:31:50,005
Speaker 2:  It's a story about wild corporate greed, about a lot of

480
00:31:50,385 --> 00:31:54,325
Speaker 2:  bad decisions and I think at its core it's about how two black

481
00:31:54,565 --> 00:31:58,325
Speaker 2:  founders found themselves ousted from their own company and really their

482
00:31:58,345 --> 00:32:02,245
Speaker 2:  own story. By a couple of fast talking wheeling and dealing

483
00:32:02,535 --> 00:32:03,205
Speaker 2:  white dudes,

484
00:32:03,605 --> 00:32:05,925
Speaker 9:  I was like, we need to pump the brakes a little bit.

485
00:32:06,645 --> 00:32:09,845
Speaker 10:  I just thought that it would be better if he wasn't a part of the team.

486
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,245
Speaker 9:  It's like the heart of MoviePass.

487
00:32:12,425 --> 00:32:14,485
Speaker 8:  The deeper you got in, the more you realize

488
00:32:15,825 --> 00:32:18,565
Speaker 9:  All of this was part of a bigger story.

489
00:32:19,825 --> 00:32:23,285
Speaker 2:  The doc is fascinating. I really recommend everyone watch it. Whether or

490
00:32:23,285 --> 00:32:27,125
Speaker 2:  not you still have your Red MoviePass card lying around. A couple of days

491
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:30,565
Speaker 2:  after I watched the doc, I got on a call with two people to talk about it.

492
00:32:30,945 --> 00:32:34,565
Speaker 9:  Stacey Spikes co-founder and CEO of MoviePass.

493
00:32:34,985 --> 00:32:35,205
Speaker 9:  My

494
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:36,885
Speaker 11:  Name is Muta Ali and I'm a film director.

495
00:32:37,365 --> 00:32:40,805
Speaker 2:  I should point out by the way that Muta Ali is the director of this film

496
00:32:41,035 --> 00:32:44,805
Speaker 2:  also, just in case that wasn't clear, this is sort of a spoiler

497
00:32:44,925 --> 00:32:48,245
Speaker 2:  I guess, but the bones of the early MoviePass story is this.

498
00:32:48,665 --> 00:32:52,645
Speaker 2:  Stacey and his co-founder Hamme Watt started MoviePass in 2011

499
00:32:52,945 --> 00:32:56,205
Speaker 2:  and it's more expensive than it turned out to be. It's doing okay. They have

500
00:32:56,205 --> 00:33:00,005
Speaker 2:  about 20,000 subscribers not taking over the world, but coming along,

501
00:33:00,075 --> 00:33:03,565
Speaker 2:  they hired this guy, Mitch Lowe, who says he was a co-founder of Netflix,

502
00:33:03,865 --> 00:33:07,605
Speaker 2:  but that turns out to not really be the case for interesting reasons, who

503
00:33:07,605 --> 00:33:11,405
Speaker 2:  then links MoviePass up with a company called Helios and Matheson and

504
00:33:11,465 --> 00:33:15,285
Speaker 2:  its CEO Ted Farnsworth who injects a bunch of marketing money

505
00:33:15,355 --> 00:33:18,765
Speaker 2:  into MoviePass in order to help it grow. And along the way,

506
00:33:19,095 --> 00:33:23,005
Speaker 2:  Mitch Lowe and Ted Farnsworth start testing ideas to see how

507
00:33:23,005 --> 00:33:25,765
Speaker 2:  they might help the thing grow into the stratosphere.

508
00:33:26,385 --> 00:33:30,365
Speaker 9:  We had grown to 20,000 subs and if you go and you look at

509
00:33:30,365 --> 00:33:34,325
Speaker 9:  the Netflix growth curve it has is long slow

510
00:33:34,585 --> 00:33:38,005
Speaker 9:  arc, and then there's this hockey puck, it just starts to take off.

511
00:33:38,465 --> 00:33:42,445
Speaker 9:  And we had a very similar trajectory in that we were a

512
00:33:42,445 --> 00:33:46,205
Speaker 9:  multimillion dollar revenue company. We weren't that far from

513
00:33:46,205 --> 00:33:50,045
Speaker 9:  profitability, we were at a $30 price point. We

514
00:33:50,045 --> 00:33:53,805
Speaker 9:  knew we were in the ballpark, but we got there with no advertising

515
00:33:53,945 --> 00:33:57,725
Speaker 9:  was only word of mouth. And so we had never had an ad

516
00:33:57,725 --> 00:34:01,485
Speaker 9:  budget. And so really it was, we had figured out what

517
00:34:01,505 --> 00:34:05,445
Speaker 9:  our customer acquisition cost was. We wanted to

518
00:34:05,445 --> 00:34:09,245
Speaker 9:  do the deal just to get ad budget but still grow with the

519
00:34:09,245 --> 00:34:13,005
Speaker 9:  right per month subscription price. And so

520
00:34:13,025 --> 00:34:16,925
Speaker 9:  that's what you wanted to do. You you needed to leave the garage

521
00:34:17,505 --> 00:34:21,485
Speaker 9:  and you had a a really hardcore fan base that people

522
00:34:21,485 --> 00:34:25,365
Speaker 9:  that just loved the service and it was break even. And

523
00:34:25,365 --> 00:34:29,245
Speaker 9:  so now great add that. Well, it broke apart

524
00:34:29,515 --> 00:34:33,485
Speaker 9:  when HMMY, they were coming in and they secretly

525
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:37,405
Speaker 9:  ran a test and Mitch had given them access

526
00:34:37,585 --> 00:34:41,085
Speaker 9:  to our login page and they went

527
00:34:41,425 --> 00:34:45,245
Speaker 9:  online and they put the new price point up and tested it.

528
00:34:45,245 --> 00:34:49,125
Speaker 9:  We thought our site had been hacked and we were like, Hey,

529
00:34:49,185 --> 00:34:53,005
Speaker 9:  our site's been hacked. Somebody just put up a landing page for 10 bucks

530
00:34:53,265 --> 00:34:57,125
Speaker 9:  and and they were like, no, no, no. Mitch gave Ted and his

531
00:34:57,125 --> 00:35:01,085
Speaker 9:  team access to the website landing page and no one ever

532
00:35:01,115 --> 00:35:04,485
Speaker 9:  told us or the engineering team. And so when you clicked on the button,

533
00:35:05,025 --> 00:35:08,645
Speaker 9:  it didn't let you sign up. They were just using it to gauge interest

534
00:35:09,025 --> 00:35:11,965
Speaker 9:  and they were like, we've got a hit. And I said, well, if you wanna make

535
00:35:11,965 --> 00:35:14,925
Speaker 9:  it even bigger, make it five bucks a month. If you want to make it bigger

536
00:35:14,925 --> 00:35:18,125
Speaker 9:  than that, make it $1 a month. I said, make it 99 cents.

537
00:35:18,555 --> 00:35:22,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah, giving money away is pretty easy, right? I kept thinking that, watching

538
00:35:22,045 --> 00:35:25,845
Speaker 2:  this, that like, oh, if you just give people money, they'll take it. Of course,

539
00:35:25,845 --> 00:35:27,965
Speaker 2:  course. And you'll be very successful at giving people money

540
00:35:28,225 --> 00:35:32,125
Speaker 9:  And it's a race to the bottom when they, you have no competitors like, well,

541
00:35:32,265 --> 00:35:35,845
Speaker 9:  but why? Why don't you walk your way down in price?

542
00:35:36,505 --> 00:35:40,365
Speaker 2:  10 bucks a month for all the movies you can watch was just never going to

543
00:35:40,365 --> 00:35:44,325
Speaker 2:  work. To be clear, it was awesome for moviegoers and one of my favorite

544
00:35:44,325 --> 00:35:47,965
Speaker 2:  things about the doc is all the folks in it who saw hundreds of movies

545
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:52,085
Speaker 2:  for a fraction of the price. I love that for moviegoers, but it was never

546
00:35:52,085 --> 00:35:55,845
Speaker 2:  sustainable Low. And Farnsworth had this big idea about

547
00:35:55,975 --> 00:35:59,845
Speaker 2:  collecting data about those moviegoers and then selling it back to

548
00:35:59,845 --> 00:36:03,645
Speaker 2:  theater chains. And eventually they seemed to think MoviePass would get

549
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:07,725
Speaker 2:  so big and so powerful that they'd be able to negotiate a piece of

550
00:36:07,725 --> 00:36:11,125
Speaker 2:  ticket sales and even concessions from those theater chains. That

551
00:36:11,345 --> 00:36:14,965
Speaker 2:  didn't happen even at the time. We all kind of knew it wasn't gonna happen.

552
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:19,365
Speaker 2:  And just in case you think that's 2020 hindsight, here is a clip from a

553
00:36:19,445 --> 00:36:21,365
Speaker 2:  VERGE video in July of 2018.

554
00:36:21,885 --> 00:36:24,365
Speaker 12:  I mean, look, the whole thing really is a mess. And it comes down to the

555
00:36:24,365 --> 00:36:27,405
Speaker 12:  fact that VPA doesn't make money. The company hopes that when it hits a

556
00:36:27,405 --> 00:36:30,645
Speaker 12:  certain subscriber base size, all the math will magically work out, but

557
00:36:30,645 --> 00:36:33,605
Speaker 12:  in the meantime, it's burning through cash, causing the stock price of its

558
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:36,765
Speaker 12:  parent company to plummet. The fix apparently seems to be to get its customers

559
00:36:36,765 --> 00:36:39,605
Speaker 12:  to just stop going to movies or if they do to pay up.

560
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:44,045
Speaker 2:  That last point is a good one, by the way. At one point to stop the money

561
00:36:44,325 --> 00:36:48,245
Speaker 2:  bleeding, MoviePass started to create weird new rules for what you

562
00:36:48,245 --> 00:36:52,165
Speaker 2:  can see and when. And its executives are actually under investigation

563
00:36:52,225 --> 00:36:56,125
Speaker 2:  for even doing worse things like allegedly breaking the

564
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:59,845
Speaker 2:  product on purpose so that people would stop using it at big movies. The

565
00:36:59,845 --> 00:37:03,805
Speaker 2:  whole thing was just a mess. And a big part of the MoviePass movie crash

566
00:37:03,895 --> 00:37:07,645
Speaker 2:  story is Stacey saying that aloud internally and getting

567
00:37:07,645 --> 00:37:08,805
Speaker 2:  pushed out of the door for it.

568
00:37:09,305 --> 00:37:13,245
Speaker 9:  You had the founder who built the plane saying it can't

569
00:37:13,245 --> 00:37:16,445
Speaker 9:  handle these G-forces. There's no way the math is gonna work.

570
00:37:17,195 --> 00:37:20,765
Speaker 9:  What made it worse to me is you had

571
00:37:21,165 --> 00:37:24,925
Speaker 9:  customers saying, I am willing to pay more to

572
00:37:24,925 --> 00:37:28,845
Speaker 9:  help you be solvent. Like when your customer base

573
00:37:28,865 --> 00:37:32,725
Speaker 9:  is saying that, that's crazy, right? If people are like, this

574
00:37:32,725 --> 00:37:36,005
Speaker 9:  is so awesome. I went to 400 movies last year,

575
00:37:36,345 --> 00:37:40,165
Speaker 9:  please charge me more because I know I'm saving a lot of money and

576
00:37:40,185 --> 00:37:43,845
Speaker 9:  I'm still, I've got so much upside, I'll pay you a hundred bucks a month

577
00:37:43,985 --> 00:37:47,885
Speaker 9:  and I'm still saving money. And when your customer base is

578
00:37:47,885 --> 00:37:51,405
Speaker 9:  saying that and your founder is saying that, then the

579
00:37:51,405 --> 00:37:55,325
Speaker 9:  writing's on the wall and that's part of the plan. You figure

580
00:37:55,385 --> 00:37:59,325
Speaker 9:  it out, you experiment and you find the right place. Great. You

581
00:37:59,335 --> 00:38:03,125
Speaker 9:  found an entry point that consumers love it now find

582
00:38:03,445 --> 00:38:07,205
Speaker 9:  a profitable place to be at. And if that's 30 bucks

583
00:38:07,325 --> 00:38:11,005
Speaker 9:  a month, yeah, you might lose a third of these people, but you're still the

584
00:38:11,005 --> 00:38:14,925
Speaker 9:  biggest subscription company in the world. So for theatrical, so

585
00:38:15,005 --> 00:38:18,285
Speaker 9:  I, that was the hard part was just adjust your pricing.

586
00:38:19,155 --> 00:38:22,045
Speaker 9:  It's like, what's wrong with that? Yeah, you're fired. Get out.

587
00:38:22,835 --> 00:38:26,285
Speaker 2:  Part of the reason I've always been interested in the MoviePass story is

588
00:38:26,285 --> 00:38:29,925
Speaker 2:  that the rough shape of that arc is something we've seen

589
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:34,005
Speaker 2:  so many times in tech. You prioritize growth at all

590
00:38:34,005 --> 00:38:37,765
Speaker 2:  costs, you lose a giant amount of money and then something,

591
00:38:37,765 --> 00:38:41,725
Speaker 2:  something you'll become so big and so powerful that you can either raise

592
00:38:41,725 --> 00:38:45,445
Speaker 2:  prices or find new ways to make money. That's the Uber story,

593
00:38:45,505 --> 00:38:49,125
Speaker 2:  that's the Lyft story, that's the bird story, that's the Instacart story,

594
00:38:49,145 --> 00:38:52,645
Speaker 2:  that's the TikTok story. On and on and on. Sometimes it works,

595
00:38:53,275 --> 00:38:57,245
Speaker 2:  usually it doesn't. It definitely didn't for MoviePass. And in fact I

596
00:38:57,245 --> 00:39:01,005
Speaker 2:  think MoviePass might have sort of speed run that whole story

597
00:39:01,115 --> 00:39:04,725
Speaker 2:  quicker than just about anybody. The other kind of tech

598
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:08,725
Speaker 2:  trope about MoviePass that kept jumping out to me was the whole fast talking

599
00:39:08,755 --> 00:39:12,485
Speaker 2:  founder with big ideas who might be full of crap, but everybody keeps listening

600
00:39:12,485 --> 00:39:16,325
Speaker 2:  to anyway thing, which is obviously a staple of Silicon

601
00:39:16,325 --> 00:39:20,285
Speaker 2:  Valley. And for Mu Ali poking at that idea, and

602
00:39:20,345 --> 00:39:24,205
Speaker 2:  in this case who played that part for MoviePass was a big part of the

603
00:39:24,205 --> 00:39:25,365
Speaker 2:  MoviePass documentary.

604
00:39:25,795 --> 00:39:29,565
Speaker 11:  When I was doing research, a lot of people in social media who were

605
00:39:29,565 --> 00:39:33,405
Speaker 11:  trying to discover what's the real story behind MoviePass, some of them

606
00:39:33,475 --> 00:39:37,365
Speaker 11:  were speaking with the understanding that Mitch Low

607
00:39:37,365 --> 00:39:41,125
Speaker 11:  and Ted Farnsworth were really the founders. They were speaking and

608
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:44,725
Speaker 11:  having these deep dives into MoviePass and not even mentioning Stacy.

609
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:49,045
Speaker 11:  And I felt that they might need to

610
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:53,085
Speaker 11:  enter the story through their perspective. It serves us in a couple ways

611
00:39:53,085 --> 00:39:56,925
Speaker 11:  because it's a little bit of a reveal for people who don't know. It

612
00:39:56,925 --> 00:40:00,205
Speaker 11:  might make some people uncomfortable who do know and maybe, oh, do these

613
00:40:00,205 --> 00:40:03,205
Speaker 11:  filmmakers even know who the real founders of MoviePass are? And they question

614
00:40:03,205 --> 00:40:06,845
Speaker 11:  that and hopefully keep watching and not assume the work. But

615
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:11,405
Speaker 11:  it also plays into part of the premise which kind of revealed

616
00:40:11,405 --> 00:40:15,365
Speaker 11:  itself in a more crystallized form once we were later on in

617
00:40:15,365 --> 00:40:19,245
Speaker 11:  production, is it has to do with racial bias and people's assumptions about

618
00:40:19,305 --> 00:40:22,525
Speaker 11:  who plays what role, especially in a tech company. And maybe if you did

619
00:40:22,525 --> 00:40:26,005
Speaker 11:  enter this story, assuming that, okay, yeah, yeah, Mitch is

620
00:40:26,345 --> 00:40:30,205
Speaker 11:  the leader and Stacey's just kind of complaining and maybe he doesn't know

621
00:40:30,225 --> 00:40:34,045
Speaker 11:  how to ride this rocket ship like Mitch does. You know, because Mitch

622
00:40:34,045 --> 00:40:37,565
Speaker 11:  is the founder of Netflix and all of a sudden your biases

623
00:40:37,745 --> 00:40:40,925
Speaker 11:  played against you and then you're like, oh, maybe I need to rethink how

624
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:44,685
Speaker 11:  I was thinking about this. And, and so that little pivot in in terms

625
00:40:44,845 --> 00:40:48,645
Speaker 11:  of the plot structure or that little inverse order helps play

626
00:40:48,675 --> 00:40:52,485
Speaker 11:  into that. I will say that it was a battle internally. You know, I didn't,

627
00:40:52,485 --> 00:40:56,325
Speaker 11:  you know, this is a collaborative thing and so I at first

628
00:40:56,325 --> 00:41:00,245
Speaker 11:  didn't want to start the story that way, but then there's an actual

629
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:04,405
Speaker 11:  arguable point someone could make that we need to start with the excitement.

630
00:41:04,405 --> 00:41:07,765
Speaker 11:  We need to start with the millions of people coming into MoviePass.

631
00:41:08,305 --> 00:41:12,245
Speaker 11:  And in my mind, part of me is like, well, you can't look over

632
00:41:12,425 --> 00:41:16,125
Speaker 11:  Stacey and I amazing, like all these 10 years of development they did before

633
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:19,805
Speaker 11:  that. And so it was a lot of back and forth and, and I actually needed to

634
00:41:19,865 --> 00:41:23,325
Speaker 11:  see it done both ways before I actually

635
00:41:23,745 --> 00:41:27,485
Speaker 11:  was on board with this little trick because I think it was Archie

636
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,925
Speaker 11:  Gibs who suggested it to me that, oh, maybe we should trick people at the

637
00:41:30,925 --> 00:41:34,605
Speaker 11:  very beginning. And I was like, I don't know exactly what that would do

638
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:38,805
Speaker 11:  to me in terms of how I feel about this story. And I didn't like

639
00:41:38,805 --> 00:41:42,645
Speaker 11:  it until I decided to like roll it out the way that

640
00:41:42,645 --> 00:41:45,845
Speaker 11:  we did, you know, and like roll it out so that it really

641
00:41:46,245 --> 00:41:50,045
Speaker 11:  emphasizes that Stacey and Jaime were in a position

642
00:41:50,045 --> 00:41:53,525
Speaker 11:  of vulnerability, a position where they weren't in control of the ship

643
00:41:54,305 --> 00:41:57,245
Speaker 11:  and okay, that's normal. They're not the founders. And then you realize,

644
00:41:57,265 --> 00:42:00,565
Speaker 11:  oh, they are the founders and they're not in position to drive this thing.

645
00:42:00,665 --> 00:42:04,165
Speaker 11:  And then you might feel a little bit more concerned about them. And so it,

646
00:42:04,185 --> 00:42:06,765
Speaker 11:  it was a lot involved. It was a lot involved and I'm glad we ended up doing

647
00:42:06,765 --> 00:42:07,725
Speaker 11:  that the way, 'cause it's kind of fun.

648
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:11,805
Speaker 2:  It really does work. It's, it's quite a, it's quite a twist, whatever, 17

649
00:42:11,805 --> 00:42:15,325
Speaker 2:  and a half minutes into the movie. Yeah. Stacy, how did that part of the

650
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:18,205
Speaker 2:  process feel? I don't know how involved you were kind of with the, the overall

651
00:42:18,205 --> 00:42:22,045
Speaker 2:  production, but like watching a lot of the sort of twists and turns of it

652
00:42:22,315 --> 00:42:25,965
Speaker 2:  play out again all these years later. Obviously it, it hasn't gone away.

653
00:42:25,965 --> 00:42:28,805
Speaker 2:  You've, you've been involved, this is the thing you lived through, but how

654
00:42:28,965 --> 00:42:32,005
Speaker 2:  does it feel to see all of it sort of put into one place in order?

655
00:42:32,605 --> 00:42:36,285
Speaker 9:  I mean, I think it was what Mutali did. So I've seen,

656
00:42:36,665 --> 00:42:40,485
Speaker 9:  you know, WeWork and Theranos and all of them, I think we

657
00:42:40,485 --> 00:42:44,045
Speaker 9:  all kinda travel in a pack and we watch these things. And

658
00:42:44,485 --> 00:42:48,245
Speaker 9:  I think what he did was closer to the

659
00:42:48,335 --> 00:42:52,205
Speaker 9:  Steve Jobs Apple story because it's the only thing, you know, they had a

660
00:42:52,205 --> 00:42:55,565
Speaker 9:  lot more airtime on CNBC or

661
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:59,925
Speaker 9:  M-S-N-B-C or all of the different shows that they were on Yahoo Finance

662
00:43:00,455 --> 00:43:04,405
Speaker 9:  where they were being presented as that and called themselves the founders.

663
00:43:05,065 --> 00:43:08,685
Speaker 9:  So whoever thought of it, or whichever way it is a master

664
00:43:08,745 --> 00:43:12,565
Speaker 9:  stroke in storytelling, 'cause it's not straight linear and

665
00:43:12,905 --> 00:43:16,765
Speaker 9:  you know, a third of the way through it's then brings you back

666
00:43:16,765 --> 00:43:20,725
Speaker 9:  to the beginning to the origin story. I thought it was a master stroke. He

667
00:43:20,725 --> 00:43:23,005
Speaker 9:  did make me nervous the first 15 minutes.

668
00:43:24,565 --> 00:43:28,325
Speaker 9:  I was like, he was sitting next to me in the theater when I was seeing it

669
00:43:28,325 --> 00:43:31,405
Speaker 9:  the first time and he got a couple the side eye glances

670
00:43:32,195 --> 00:43:36,125
Speaker 9:  like, and he and he literally said, just wait for it. Wait for it.

671
00:43:36,285 --> 00:43:39,645
Speaker 9:  'cause I didn't know what was happening. And he literally had to tell me,

672
00:43:39,835 --> 00:43:43,685
Speaker 9:  hang on, because I wanted to pause the film and

673
00:43:43,685 --> 00:43:44,805
Speaker 9:  go have a conversation

674
00:43:46,025 --> 00:43:48,925
Speaker 2:  In the first cut. He should have just cut you out entirely just as a, just

675
00:43:48,925 --> 00:43:51,045
Speaker 2:  as a big, just really make you sweat for a while.

676
00:43:51,155 --> 00:43:54,885
Speaker 9:  Yeah. He, my wife was there with me and she, she goes, did they know you

677
00:43:54,885 --> 00:43:58,245
Speaker 9:  were the founder? And I go, yes. I said, yes, hang on.

678
00:43:59,265 --> 00:44:02,925
Speaker 11:  He waited until the end. We were at almost, I think picture lock by the

679
00:44:02,925 --> 00:44:06,245
Speaker 11:  time Stacey saw it. So it wasn't like he had a big chance to change

680
00:44:06,715 --> 00:44:09,485
Speaker 11:  much. So it was, it was do or die at that point. Yeah.

681
00:44:10,145 --> 00:44:13,925
Speaker 2:  One thing I've always wondered about MoviePass is could it have worked

682
00:44:14,345 --> 00:44:17,565
Speaker 2:  if they hadn't grown too fast, burned money at unprecedented rates, made

683
00:44:17,685 --> 00:44:21,205
Speaker 2:  a series of ridiculous bad decisions. Is there a

684
00:44:21,265 --> 00:44:25,165
Speaker 2:  stable idea underneath here? Both Mutali and Stacey

685
00:44:25,305 --> 00:44:28,925
Speaker 2:  agreed that the $10 a month thing killed MoviePass. But

686
00:44:29,115 --> 00:44:32,205
Speaker 2:  both seemed to think that it didn't necessarily have to,

687
00:44:32,965 --> 00:44:36,285
Speaker 11:  I think there were a series of, of failures that took place that allowed

688
00:44:36,475 --> 00:44:40,045
Speaker 11:  MoviePass to, to crash in a way that it did. The biggest though,

689
00:44:40,445 --> 00:44:44,405
Speaker 11:  I think is having 9 95 as that price point for promotional

690
00:44:44,405 --> 00:44:47,605
Speaker 11:  purposes turning into this is our price point forever.

691
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:52,365
Speaker 11:  And I wonder, Stacy, you know, I think you said it was 48 hours

692
00:44:52,435 --> 00:44:54,965
Speaker 11:  when you had the price at 9 95 and then you gained

693
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:59,245
Speaker 11:  175,000 new subscribers in two days. If you had

694
00:44:59,245 --> 00:45:02,925
Speaker 11:  cut it off, then maybe that would've been the secret to

695
00:45:02,925 --> 00:45:05,845
Speaker 11:  success. 'cause you would've gotten that marketing boost. Or, or or what

696
00:45:05,845 --> 00:45:06,805
Speaker 11:  do you think? Yeah,

697
00:45:06,885 --> 00:45:10,685
Speaker 9:  I, I think, and we talked about it, we said great, turn that off.

698
00:45:11,035 --> 00:45:14,645
Speaker 9:  Tell everyone this is a promotional price point and

699
00:45:15,075 --> 00:45:18,845
Speaker 9:  just give 'em a heads up. This is a promotional price point. You're all month

700
00:45:18,845 --> 00:45:22,765
Speaker 9:  to month. At some point this will normalize but enjoy it

701
00:45:23,065 --> 00:45:26,285
Speaker 9:  for now, right? Yeah. And then I would take certain

702
00:45:26,565 --> 00:45:30,485
Speaker 9:  segments and I would've said, these people are going up to 30, like test

703
00:45:30,485 --> 00:45:33,645
Speaker 9:  different zones and different things. Test your different price points,

704
00:45:34,385 --> 00:45:37,765
Speaker 9:  see what elasticity you have. If we go up to

705
00:45:37,765 --> 00:45:41,565
Speaker 9:  $50, how high is the churn? If we're at $30 or if

706
00:45:41,565 --> 00:45:45,325
Speaker 9:  we're at 25, but what's the lowest we can go based on the behavior

707
00:45:45,455 --> 00:45:48,965
Speaker 9:  we're seeing? And then you move your price and you're gonna get some churn.

708
00:45:48,985 --> 00:45:52,765
Speaker 9:  But you got so many people excited off the original idea

709
00:45:53,155 --> 00:45:57,085
Speaker 9:  that they keep going and that's all you had to do. And you,

710
00:45:57,225 --> 00:46:00,845
Speaker 9:  and we would be sitting here talking about a really big

711
00:46:01,435 --> 00:46:05,205
Speaker 9:  company, a big global company. That was

712
00:46:05,265 --> 00:46:09,165
Speaker 9:  way 'cause in a MC or Regal would never have been able to catch up

713
00:46:09,165 --> 00:46:09,445
Speaker 9:  to you.

714
00:46:10,235 --> 00:46:13,935
Speaker 2:  To be fair. Of course Stacey believes all of that. He's actually the CEO

715
00:46:13,935 --> 00:46:17,415
Speaker 2:  of MoviePass again, after being ousted from the company in 2018,

716
00:46:17,795 --> 00:46:21,575
Speaker 2:  it went through all of its disasters. He bought the company back in

717
00:46:21,575 --> 00:46:25,535
Speaker 2:  2021 and actually relaunched it last year. There were a bunch of

718
00:46:25,635 --> 00:46:29,455
Speaker 2:  new things about it, some Web3 stuff that I thought

719
00:46:29,455 --> 00:46:32,015
Speaker 2:  was kind of weird at the time, but doesn't really seem to have come to anything.

720
00:46:32,355 --> 00:46:33,895
Speaker 2:  But it operates very differently

721
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:38,375
Speaker 9:  From a technology standpoint. We had some of the innovation, so we

722
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:42,295
Speaker 9:  had our first year back and we were profitable and we added

723
00:46:42,455 --> 00:46:45,615
Speaker 9:  a credit system where we knew we needed a governor

724
00:46:46,395 --> 00:46:50,015
Speaker 9:  to be between the consumer, the product,

725
00:46:50,435 --> 00:46:54,255
Speaker 9:  and the marketplace. And in any marketplace you

726
00:46:54,255 --> 00:46:58,015
Speaker 9:  need to show value to the consumer so that the consumer

727
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:01,615
Speaker 9:  can have alignment with the company. And in version one,

728
00:47:01,845 --> 00:47:05,135
Speaker 9:  whether you went to say an A MC

729
00:47:05,505 --> 00:47:09,495
Speaker 9:  where there maybe wasn't a partnership or you went to A, B and

730
00:47:09,575 --> 00:47:13,295
Speaker 9:  B where there was in the app, you couldn't see the

731
00:47:13,295 --> 00:47:17,255
Speaker 9:  difference. And though we were getting wholesale pricing from

732
00:47:17,255 --> 00:47:21,175
Speaker 9:  someone else, there was no display of that. So this version

733
00:47:21,555 --> 00:47:25,495
Speaker 9:  we simply said let's use a credit system to show

734
00:47:25,495 --> 00:47:29,245
Speaker 9:  alignment when the price is cheaper and say

735
00:47:29,495 --> 00:47:32,885
Speaker 9:  let's motivate them by giving them a certain number of credits

736
00:47:33,345 --> 00:47:37,285
Speaker 9:  so that now they are aligned with saving money the way we are aligned

737
00:47:37,285 --> 00:47:41,125
Speaker 9:  with saving money. That didn't exist in V one, but we knew

738
00:47:41,395 --> 00:47:44,965
Speaker 9:  that was the pathway because we were beginning to test that in 2016.

739
00:47:45,425 --> 00:47:49,405
Speaker 9:  And so when I said, guys, let me tell you how to get there A

740
00:47:49,405 --> 00:47:53,245
Speaker 9:  raise the price B, we have this variable pricing capability,

741
00:47:53,555 --> 00:47:57,445
Speaker 9:  they were like, no, this $10 price point is so awesome. We're

742
00:47:57,445 --> 00:48:01,085
Speaker 9:  adding a quarter of a million. I'm like, you're losing $30 per person per

743
00:48:01,085 --> 00:48:03,965
Speaker 9:  month. So I think that the technology,

744
00:48:04,835 --> 00:48:08,805
Speaker 9:  it's subscription. This isn't, this isn't new. Since newspapers

745
00:48:08,875 --> 00:48:12,805
Speaker 9:  were born, we've had subscription businesses. So a lot

746
00:48:12,805 --> 00:48:16,765
Speaker 9:  of, it's not new, but the way to use the tech is

747
00:48:16,825 --> 00:48:20,485
Speaker 9:  new. So now we built it with machine learning and AI engines,

748
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:24,605
Speaker 9:  which is very different. So I think the technology was there, it's just

749
00:48:24,865 --> 00:48:28,045
Speaker 9:  stupid, was driving the bus and that's all that happened.

750
00:48:29,025 --> 00:48:32,685
Speaker 2:  The problem with that theory though is that the movie theater industry looks

751
00:48:32,705 --> 00:48:36,405
Speaker 2:  really different now than it did in 2018 or 2011

752
00:48:36,545 --> 00:48:39,365
Speaker 2:  for that matter when they first started working on this. We're in the midst

753
00:48:39,385 --> 00:48:43,045
Speaker 2:  of one of the worst box office runs in a long time.

754
00:48:43,425 --> 00:48:47,085
Speaker 2:  We just had the worst memorial day at the movie theater in three decades.

755
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:51,325
Speaker 2:  And by at least one measure that I saw, ticket sales are 22%

756
00:48:51,335 --> 00:48:54,725
Speaker 2:  below where they were at this point a year ago. And a full

757
00:48:54,775 --> 00:48:58,445
Speaker 2:  41% down from 2019. It's kind of like the

758
00:48:58,725 --> 00:49:02,685
Speaker 2:  pandemic happened and movie theaters just never came back, which makes

759
00:49:02,685 --> 00:49:05,845
Speaker 2:  sense, right? We're streaming more, we're on Netflix more, we're home more.

760
00:49:06,135 --> 00:49:09,965
Speaker 2:  Maybe movie theaters are just over. This is not remotely

761
00:49:10,255 --> 00:49:14,125
Speaker 2:  surprising to anyone who is like living life and watching TV more

762
00:49:14,125 --> 00:49:17,965
Speaker 2:  often, but Stacey doesn't think it's the case. This guy loves the

763
00:49:17,965 --> 00:49:18,165
Speaker 2:  movies.

764
00:49:19,025 --> 00:49:22,885
Speaker 9:  I'm not a filmmaker, but I love and respect

765
00:49:23,275 --> 00:49:25,805
Speaker 9:  what people like Mutali will spend

766
00:49:26,215 --> 00:49:29,925
Speaker 9:  3, 4, 5, 6, 7 years on bringing

767
00:49:30,525 --> 00:49:34,245
Speaker 9:  a 90 minute story to screens and telling

768
00:49:34,275 --> 00:49:38,125
Speaker 9:  this they are our prophets, they are

769
00:49:38,585 --> 00:49:42,405
Speaker 9:  our freedom fighters. They bring stories that

770
00:49:42,405 --> 00:49:46,005
Speaker 9:  otherwise would never get seen. It's such an important

771
00:49:46,185 --> 00:49:50,125
Speaker 9:  art form that is under attack that if you know you

772
00:49:50,155 --> 00:49:54,045
Speaker 9:  have the burden of responsibility, that you have technologies that can

773
00:49:54,345 --> 00:49:58,205
Speaker 9:  double the attendance of movie going and you

774
00:49:58,205 --> 00:50:01,485
Speaker 9:  can create efficiencies in a, in a sector that

775
00:50:01,715 --> 00:50:05,445
Speaker 9:  doesn't work with itself. When you see a Netflix, they can go

776
00:50:05,555 --> 00:50:09,285
Speaker 9:  into a space, dominate that space from top to bottom

777
00:50:09,285 --> 00:50:13,125
Speaker 9:  because they have the direct to consumer relationship and no one

778
00:50:13,155 --> 00:50:16,965
Speaker 9:  ever built anything from the consumer point of view and

779
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:20,885
Speaker 9:  empowering the consumer. So I think it's a beautiful moment in time

780
00:50:20,885 --> 00:50:24,845
Speaker 9:  because I don't want that cinema died on my watch, you know

781
00:50:24,845 --> 00:50:28,365
Speaker 9:  that it was a simple technology upgrade. I want the

782
00:50:28,585 --> 00:50:32,005
Speaker 9:  Mutali of the world to forever be able to tell stories

783
00:50:32,505 --> 00:50:36,245
Speaker 9:  in such a powerful medium. And theaters

784
00:50:36,245 --> 00:50:39,445
Speaker 9:  shouldn't be these things on their last legs. It's just

785
00:50:39,635 --> 00:50:43,285
Speaker 9:  stupidity and arrogance and pride that's preventing

786
00:50:43,295 --> 00:50:47,245
Speaker 9:  technology from unlocking such great opportunities.

787
00:50:47,665 --> 00:50:51,205
Speaker 9:  We are in such a beautiful moment that if we can get out of the way,

788
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:55,725
Speaker 9:  I think that storytelling will go to the next level. 'cause

789
00:50:55,765 --> 00:50:59,085
Speaker 9:  I think we're on The Verge of a new golden age of cinema

790
00:50:59,795 --> 00:51:03,365
Speaker 9:  from we see how storytelling

791
00:51:04,085 --> 00:51:07,405
Speaker 9:  creation is just mind blowingly changing

792
00:51:07,905 --> 00:51:11,685
Speaker 9:  and you see how even the sight and sound experience in the theater is

793
00:51:11,845 --> 00:51:14,845
Speaker 9:  changing, but what it takes to get people there

794
00:51:15,535 --> 00:51:19,245
Speaker 9:  isn't changing. And that's the part that we are focused on and I feel blessed

795
00:51:19,245 --> 00:51:21,485
Speaker 9:  to be able to have the privilege to be able to do that.

796
00:51:22,035 --> 00:51:25,965
Speaker 2:  Yeah, basically. Other than Dune, it's been a disaster at theaters

797
00:51:25,965 --> 00:51:29,285
Speaker 2:  this year. And I'm curious from both of your perspectives, like what do we

798
00:51:29,285 --> 00:51:32,325
Speaker 2:  do next with movie theaters? I agree it could be easier. I agree buying it

799
00:51:32,325 --> 00:51:35,565
Speaker 2:  should, it could be cheaper, all this stuff. But I do wonder, does something

800
00:51:35,595 --> 00:51:39,365
Speaker 2:  fundamental in the movie going experience need to change

801
00:51:39,365 --> 00:51:39,645
Speaker 2:  here?

802
00:51:40,265 --> 00:51:44,085
Speaker 9:  Cinema has a PR problem, it doesn't have an attendance problem.

803
00:51:44,385 --> 00:51:48,005
Speaker 9:  You notice that this past weekend, okay,

804
00:51:48,555 --> 00:51:52,205
Speaker 9:  more people went in four days to the movies

805
00:51:52,835 --> 00:51:56,685
Speaker 9:  than everyone who will attend in NFL game

806
00:51:56,785 --> 00:52:00,725
Speaker 9:  in an entire year in four days. That's how many

807
00:52:00,725 --> 00:52:04,485
Speaker 9:  people went to the movies. Okay, you don't get at a football

808
00:52:04,485 --> 00:52:08,205
Speaker 9:  game. They don't tell you how many tickets are sold at every

809
00:52:08,205 --> 00:52:12,165
Speaker 9:  single game. I think that we need to stop reporting

810
00:52:12,305 --> 00:52:16,245
Speaker 9:  box office numbers because we're focused on the wrong things. We're not focused

811
00:52:16,245 --> 00:52:20,165
Speaker 9:  on movie making, we're focused on movie going. And it

812
00:52:20,165 --> 00:52:24,125
Speaker 9:  doesn't matter how great the movie was because most really

813
00:52:24,265 --> 00:52:28,005
Speaker 9:  big films didn't gross at the box office,

814
00:52:28,155 --> 00:52:32,085
Speaker 9:  over time they became part of our culture. And so we

815
00:52:32,085 --> 00:52:35,725
Speaker 9:  are focused on the wrong thing because everything is determined by

816
00:52:35,985 --> 00:52:39,725
Speaker 9:  one number. What was the gross of the box office this

817
00:52:39,725 --> 00:52:43,525
Speaker 9:  weekend compared to last year or the year before? We need to stop

818
00:52:43,555 --> 00:52:47,485
Speaker 9:  reporting those numbers and get back to the days. When I was a kid,

819
00:52:47,825 --> 00:52:51,245
Speaker 9:  you didn't report grosses of Star Wars. It wasn't until

820
00:52:51,405 --> 00:52:55,205
Speaker 9:  IMDB and certain other things came online that my

821
00:52:55,365 --> 00:52:59,045
Speaker 9:  mom would call up and go, oh you know what's such and such gross this weekend?

822
00:52:59,545 --> 00:53:03,525
Speaker 9:  We became obsessed with that and you'll hear even with YouTube

823
00:53:03,665 --> 00:53:06,885
Speaker 9:  and a lot of creators, they say, I stopped watching

824
00:53:07,505 --> 00:53:11,325
Speaker 9:  my view number, I started focusing on content and I

825
00:53:11,325 --> 00:53:15,285
Speaker 9:  started focusing on doing the right content and it will

826
00:53:15,285 --> 00:53:19,005
Speaker 9:  take care of itself. Movie going is healthy when you

827
00:53:19,005 --> 00:53:22,605
Speaker 9:  stop comparing it to these numbers that every Monday morning

828
00:53:22,905 --> 00:53:26,605
Speaker 9:  you have a report card that you failed. No sports do this,

829
00:53:27,185 --> 00:53:31,005
Speaker 9:  no other industry, the travel industry, they report

830
00:53:31,115 --> 00:53:34,805
Speaker 9:  quarterly where some single companies, but you do not

831
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:38,845
Speaker 9:  get group wide grosses every weekend on a

832
00:53:39,005 --> 00:53:42,485
Speaker 9:  business you don't have it. So I think that's detrimental to us. It gives

833
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:44,165
Speaker 9:  us a very big PR problem.

834
00:53:44,335 --> 00:53:45,005
Speaker 11:  Definitely.

835
00:53:45,005 --> 00:53:47,565
Speaker 2:  Definitely. That's a good take. I have not heard that before. I actually

836
00:53:47,565 --> 00:53:50,605
Speaker 2:  really agree with that. Mus Ali, what do you think are movie theaters? You're,

837
00:53:50,605 --> 00:53:54,285
Speaker 2:  you're making stuff for the internet, who cares about movie theaters, right?

838
00:53:54,585 --> 00:53:58,405
Speaker 11:  No, I care about movie theaters. I the most fun I've had out this year

839
00:53:58,465 --> 00:54:02,085
Speaker 11:  has been at movie theaters, but it was screening MoviePass movie crash.

840
00:54:02,345 --> 00:54:06,205
Speaker 11:  So I think that's probably why. But that in-person experience is

841
00:54:06,205 --> 00:54:10,005
Speaker 11:  something that will always be better than watching it at

842
00:54:10,005 --> 00:54:13,845
Speaker 11:  home. And speaking of Dune, I just watched Dune two for the first time

843
00:54:14,235 --> 00:54:17,765
Speaker 11:  with my brother and we watched it on a TV and

844
00:54:18,325 --> 00:54:22,245
Speaker 11:  I wish that we had watched it in the theater. Maybe the second time I felt

845
00:54:22,245 --> 00:54:26,125
Speaker 11:  that way, like oh this movie was so great. I wish that I'd seen it in

846
00:54:26,125 --> 00:54:29,925
Speaker 11:  the theater out with other people. That sort of glow that happens

847
00:54:30,035 --> 00:54:33,245
Speaker 11:  when you go and that that communal experience that Stacy was

848
00:54:33,525 --> 00:54:36,485
Speaker 11:  referring to is something special that

849
00:54:37,405 --> 00:54:41,165
Speaker 11:  culturally I think we're going turn back toward after

850
00:54:41,225 --> 00:54:45,205
Speaker 11:  we get enough of sort of the convenience of watching movies on our phone.

851
00:54:45,745 --> 00:54:49,605
Speaker 11:  And I think movie going is still gonna thrive and I think maybe it's just

852
00:54:49,605 --> 00:54:52,405
Speaker 11:  time for us to be reminded of how special it's,

853
00:54:52,685 --> 00:54:56,645
Speaker 2:  I like it. I will say Dune two ripped in theaters. No. Like it's one of

854
00:54:56,645 --> 00:54:59,885
Speaker 2:  the maybe the best theater going experience, not to make you feel bad. One

855
00:54:59,885 --> 00:55:02,765
Speaker 2:  of the best movie theater experiences I've had in a very long time. The movie

856
00:55:02,785 --> 00:55:03,485
Speaker 2:  is just so

857
00:55:03,795 --> 00:55:07,485
Speaker 9:  Loud, it's still playing some places. See it in Dolby Atmos.

858
00:55:07,715 --> 00:55:11,405
Speaker 9:  Yeah, because the sound design in there is just insane.

859
00:55:11,765 --> 00:55:14,605
Speaker 9:  I haven't seen anybody's house that can do Dolby Atmos.

860
00:55:15,475 --> 00:55:19,365
Speaker 2:  He's right about that I think. And I agree that there is still something

861
00:55:19,365 --> 00:55:21,725
Speaker 2:  to be said for going to the movies. I certainly

862
00:57:53,335 --> 00:57:57,225
Speaker 15:  non-starter kind of spot for renters. Am I wrong in that? Let me

863
00:57:57,225 --> 00:58:00,185
Speaker 15:  know 'cause I would love to be proven wrong in that. Like please I would

864
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:03,105
Speaker 15:  desperately love that, but I don't know. You let me know. Thanks. Bye.

865
00:58:03,685 --> 00:58:06,225
Speaker 2:  All right, well ask and you shall receive Gen Tui. How are you?

866
00:58:06,885 --> 00:58:10,745
Speaker 16:  I'm good thanks. Hi Chris too. Very excited to answer this question 'cause

867
00:58:10,745 --> 00:58:14,665
Speaker 16:  it's a topic I get asked a lot. So yeah, lots to dive

868
00:58:14,695 --> 00:58:17,785
Speaker 16:  into in your question there. The first one I'm gonna say

869
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:21,945
Speaker 16:  renters. Yes, there is lots of great stuff you can do,

870
00:58:22,275 --> 00:58:25,945
Speaker 16:  especially if you have Home Assistant. I mean Chris, you're already set

871
00:58:25,945 --> 00:58:28,865
Speaker 16:  up pretty well for doing some cool stuff. I'd actually say there's sort

872
00:58:28,865 --> 00:58:32,825
Speaker 16:  of two answers here. Like if you are a renter, there are options.

873
00:58:33,045 --> 00:58:36,105
Speaker 16:  If you're a renter with Home Assistant, there are way more options.

874
00:58:36,365 --> 00:58:37,665
Speaker 2:  Oh, interesting. Okay. Just

875
00:58:37,665 --> 00:58:41,225
Speaker 16:  Because you know, it sounds like Chris is maybe, you know, quite technically

876
00:58:41,385 --> 00:58:41,545
Speaker 16:  advanced.

877
00:58:41,865 --> 00:58:44,865
Speaker 2:  I mean if you have Home Assistant, I think that's, we're safe to assume on

878
00:58:44,865 --> 00:58:45,905
Speaker 16:  A raspberry pie. Yeah.

879
00:58:45,905 --> 00:58:46,665
Speaker 2:  Safe to assume. Yeah, you're

880
00:58:46,665 --> 00:58:50,505
Speaker 16:  Doing well, you know what you're doing. And then also he mentioned Apple

881
00:58:50,575 --> 00:58:54,465
Speaker 16:  Home, so I'm assuming that's his main platform that does narrow

882
00:58:54,495 --> 00:58:57,905
Speaker 16:  your choices down. But then Home Assistant widens them back up again.

883
00:58:58,365 --> 00:59:02,025
Speaker 16:  But just to answer that overall question about renters, I do think there

884
00:59:02,025 --> 00:59:05,545
Speaker 16:  are more and more options for renters. And you mentioned door locks. Door

885
00:59:05,545 --> 00:59:08,345
Speaker 16:  locks actually are in a better space for renters and they have been for

886
00:59:08,425 --> 00:59:11,785
Speaker 16:  a long time. There's the August wifi smart lock, which has been sort of

887
00:59:11,785 --> 00:59:15,465
Speaker 16:  our number one choice for renters because it's retrofit. So you are not

888
00:59:15,465 --> 00:59:19,185
Speaker 16:  having to replace your door lock, which your landlord may not like,

889
00:59:19,245 --> 00:59:23,085
Speaker 16:  but you still get to control the lock in a way that is useful

890
00:59:23,085 --> 00:59:24,325
Speaker 16:  for, for a smart home perspective.

891
00:59:24,465 --> 00:59:28,205
Speaker 2:  That's the one that just goes like on over top of the existing lock, right?

892
00:59:28,335 --> 00:59:31,525
Speaker 16:  Right of the back of your deadbolt. Yeah, you actually, you do have to remove

893
00:59:31,525 --> 00:59:34,845
Speaker 16:  the thumb term, but everything else stays as is. That

894
00:59:34,845 --> 00:59:35,325
Speaker 2:  Is pretty clever.

895
00:59:35,535 --> 00:59:38,965
Speaker 16:  Which makes it very easy. Also means you can take it with you when you,

896
00:59:38,965 --> 00:59:42,925
Speaker 16:  if you move to another apartment and also they've just, Yale has just come

897
00:59:42,925 --> 00:59:46,805
Speaker 16:  out with a new retrofit smart lock, so there's another good

898
00:59:46,805 --> 00:59:49,965
Speaker 16:  option there. And they both, both Yale and August who are owned by the same

899
00:59:49,965 --> 00:59:53,765
Speaker 16:  company and their sister brands, they have come out with a new keypad

900
00:59:53,765 --> 00:59:57,485
Speaker 16:  that has a touch fingerprint reader in it. So you can now

901
00:59:58,025 --> 01:00:00,885
Speaker 16:  use a fingerprint to unlock your August wifi smart lock.

902
01:00:01,115 --> 01:00:04,765
Speaker 2:  That is the thing about the smart home that feels the most sci-fi to me by

903
01:00:04,765 --> 01:00:08,285
Speaker 2:  the way. The fingerprint thing, it just, yeah, it's, it's the most like mission

904
01:00:08,335 --> 01:00:12,285
Speaker 2:  impossible thing that I have tried in the smart home and I, I cannot recommend

905
01:00:12,285 --> 01:00:12,605
Speaker 2:  it enough

906
01:00:12,985 --> 01:00:16,805
Speaker 16:  And that, well they've now got facial recognition for smart locks. So

907
01:00:16,965 --> 01:00:20,045
Speaker 16:  I haven't tried that yet, but that came out at CES. But yes, the F and the

908
01:00:20,045 --> 01:00:23,085
Speaker 16:  fingerprint is great. It's really easy. It's my favorite way of unlocking

909
01:00:23,085 --> 01:00:26,805
Speaker 16:  the door. Apple Home Key is also a really useful way if you use Apple

910
01:00:26,805 --> 01:00:30,365
Speaker 16:  Home. Unfortunately there are not any retrofit door locks that work with

911
01:00:30,575 --> 01:00:34,565
Speaker 16:  Apple Home Key right now because it's all inside the house. So

912
01:00:34,795 --> 01:00:38,565
Speaker 16:  there's nothing to do the NFC. Right. Although these new

913
01:00:38,715 --> 01:00:42,685
Speaker 16:  keypads do have NFC in them. So it is potential, we may see Home

914
01:00:42,745 --> 01:00:46,125
Speaker 16:  Key come to some of these retrofit locks. And that brings me to the second

915
01:00:46,125 --> 01:00:48,885
Speaker 16:  retrofit lock I would recommend, which is actually coming out this month.

916
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:52,325
Speaker 16:  And when I say recommend, I haven't tested it yet, but I have tested some

917
01:00:52,325 --> 01:00:55,925
Speaker 16:  of their past products and they've been good. A carer is coming out with

918
01:00:56,205 --> 01:00:59,805
Speaker 16:  a retrofit smart lock. So the same concept, you can

919
01:00:59,915 --> 01:01:03,885
Speaker 16:  just replace the thumb term on your deadbolt and then you put

920
01:01:03,885 --> 01:01:07,485
Speaker 16:  a, you can put a keypad out in the front of your house so that you can access

921
01:01:07,485 --> 01:01:11,405
Speaker 16:  it. That also has a fingerprint reader that does have NFC in.

922
01:01:12,105 --> 01:01:15,965
Speaker 16:  And I would not be surprised if at some point in future that could

923
01:01:15,965 --> 01:01:19,045
Speaker 16:  support Home Key. 'cause a Cara already does support Home Key in some of

924
01:01:19,045 --> 01:01:22,845
Speaker 16:  its products. So there's lots of options now they didn't use to be. So

925
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:25,925
Speaker 16:  that's nice for Home Kit, apple Home compatible

926
01:01:26,525 --> 01:01:27,965
Speaker 16:  retrofit Smart locks. Do

927
01:01:27,965 --> 01:01:31,765
Speaker 2:  You think that's a good, like third place to start the lock thing?

928
01:01:32,205 --> 01:01:35,645
Speaker 16:  I do. I think locks are actually my favorite smart home device.

929
01:01:36,155 --> 01:01:39,885
Speaker 16:  Most useful, easiest for everyone to use. Not complicated

930
01:01:40,225 --> 01:01:44,165
Speaker 16:  mostly, and provide real value. You know, being

931
01:01:44,165 --> 01:01:47,725
Speaker 16:  able to unlock and lock your door remotely if there's a problem. There's

932
01:01:47,825 --> 01:01:51,565
Speaker 16:  so much value I think in smart locks and the safety issue.

933
01:01:51,835 --> 01:01:54,725
Speaker 16:  It's just as easy. I think if you're concerned about someone hacking your

934
01:01:54,725 --> 01:01:58,125
Speaker 16:  smart door lock don't be, it's just, just as easy for someone to break a

935
01:01:58,125 --> 01:02:01,685
Speaker 16:  window. It's easier, much easier, sorry to break a window

936
01:02:01,875 --> 01:02:05,405
Speaker 16:  than it is to hack your smart lock. And in terms of whether someone's gonna

937
01:02:05,575 --> 01:02:09,405
Speaker 16:  knock your door down again, regular door lock, smart lock, not a big difference.

938
01:02:09,745 --> 01:02:13,485
Speaker 16:  So yeah, I I, I would not worry about the safety side unless you have someone

939
01:02:13,655 --> 01:02:17,525
Speaker 16:  who's really smart, a big hacker who's after you, in which case maybe

940
01:02:18,315 --> 01:02:22,245
Speaker 16:  fair. But in terms of the third thing, I mean it, it differs I think

941
01:02:22,245 --> 01:02:26,205
Speaker 16:  for renters perhaps from people that own their homes because you

942
01:02:26,205 --> 01:02:29,805
Speaker 16:  know, a smart thermostat is a big one, right? Energy management, you know,

943
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:33,525
Speaker 16:  bringing that into your smart home. I would say if a smart thermostat is,

944
01:02:33,745 --> 01:02:37,565
Speaker 16:  the research shows that the top three devices people use

945
01:02:37,645 --> 01:02:41,485
Speaker 16:  in their smart homes as smart video doorbells, smart cameras, which

946
01:02:41,485 --> 01:02:45,165
Speaker 16:  are kind of the same smart thermostats and then robot vacuums.

947
01:02:45,365 --> 01:02:49,045
Speaker 16:  Oh, interesting, okay. As well as smart light bulbs are in there at number

948
01:02:49,045 --> 01:02:52,525
Speaker 16:  four than the robot vacuums. So you've already got the smart light. I mean,

949
01:02:52,565 --> 01:02:56,445
Speaker 16:  a video doorbell is, you can do a battery powered one as a renter, so

950
01:02:56,445 --> 01:02:59,725
Speaker 16:  that's a good option. Yep. Door locks actually, you know, aren't in the

951
01:02:59,745 --> 01:03:03,645
Speaker 16:  top categories. I think it's just still, still a bit

952
01:03:03,645 --> 01:03:07,285
Speaker 16:  of a niche. But I do find it, like I said, one of the most useful

953
01:03:07,375 --> 01:03:11,325
Speaker 16:  smart devices in my home and you use it every day and yeah, there's a

954
01:03:11,325 --> 01:03:14,765
Speaker 16:  lot of innovation in this space too. But for Chris,

955
01:03:15,105 --> 01:03:19,045
Speaker 16:  who has, I think, you know, that is probably an more advanced smart home

956
01:03:19,075 --> 01:03:22,925
Speaker 16:  user, what I would recommend as like the third thing based on what he

957
01:03:22,945 --> 01:03:26,645
Speaker 16:  has is more automation. Mm. So that is using

958
01:03:27,075 --> 01:03:31,005
Speaker 16:  sensors, making your home smart, not just having a few smart devices in

959
01:03:31,005 --> 01:03:34,725
Speaker 16:  it. And because he has Home Assistant, you know, using devices

960
01:03:34,875 --> 01:03:38,605
Speaker 16:  like motion sensors, contact sensors, smart plugs, smart

961
01:03:38,605 --> 01:03:42,405
Speaker 16:  buttons to kind of bring everything together and work more

962
01:03:42,645 --> 01:03:46,525
Speaker 16:  seamlessly. Going back to a carer who I mentioned at the beginning, that's

963
01:03:46,525 --> 01:03:50,285
Speaker 16:  a really good option for someone that's using Apple Home and Home Assistant

964
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:53,965
Speaker 16:  because you can actually, the most of their ZigBee devices will pair directly

965
01:03:53,965 --> 01:03:57,445
Speaker 16:  to Home Assistant and they have great inexpensive motion sensors, smart

966
01:03:57,445 --> 01:04:01,125
Speaker 16:  buttons. So things like he can have his lights turn on when he

967
01:04:01,135 --> 01:04:04,845
Speaker 16:  opens his front door. Or what would be really fun for him to try actually

968
01:04:04,845 --> 01:04:08,805
Speaker 16:  is the FP two Presence Sensor, which is in a car device. And

969
01:04:08,805 --> 01:04:12,605
Speaker 16:  that in I think works really well in apartment setting because I've

970
01:04:12,605 --> 01:04:15,405
Speaker 16:  struggled to get it to work in my home because I have so many people in

971
01:04:15,405 --> 01:04:18,925
Speaker 16:  my home fair. But it uses millimeter wave sensing, which is a really

972
01:04:19,245 --> 01:04:22,885
Speaker 16:  interesting development in smart home sensing, radar sensing to

973
01:04:23,065 --> 01:04:26,525
Speaker 16:  use presence detection versus motion detection. So if he's sitting in his

974
01:04:26,525 --> 01:04:30,245
Speaker 16:  living room watching TV or your lights won't turn off because you haven't

975
01:04:30,245 --> 01:04:34,085
Speaker 16:  moved. Right. So, and I, I find that that that's a really interesting

976
01:04:34,235 --> 01:04:38,085
Speaker 16:  sort of development in the smart home. And for Chris, the FP two does

977
01:04:38,085 --> 01:04:41,085
Speaker 16:  work with Home Assistant, we can include in the show notes as this great

978
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:44,165
Speaker 16:  blog that this one guy wrote exactly about how to integrate it with Home

979
01:04:44,165 --> 01:04:48,045
Speaker 16:  Assistant and what benefits there are. So, you know, for,

980
01:04:48,225 --> 01:04:51,925
Speaker 16:  for Chris, I think more automation, you know, making your home smarter

981
01:04:51,925 --> 01:04:55,165
Speaker 16:  because things like sensors, contact sensors, you can take 'em with you

982
01:04:55,165 --> 01:04:58,925
Speaker 16:  when you leave too. But yeah, so there's lots. And then the one, the

983
01:04:58,925 --> 01:05:02,245
Speaker 16:  final thing I would say that a lot of people are interested in and works

984
01:05:02,245 --> 01:05:05,645
Speaker 16:  for both renters and homeowners is a smart security system.

985
01:05:05,875 --> 01:05:09,285
Speaker 16:  There's a lot of benefit there, especially 'cause if you can integrate with

986
01:05:09,285 --> 01:05:12,485
Speaker 16:  say your door lock and your video doorbell if you want a video doorbell.

987
01:05:12,945 --> 01:05:15,645
Speaker 16:  So there's a lot the smart home has to offer for renters.

988
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:19,765
Speaker 2:  And it does seem like, I, I think the stigma that anything beyond

989
01:05:19,985 --> 01:05:23,805
Speaker 2:  the very basics requires opening up your walls, I think is so much less

990
01:05:23,805 --> 01:05:27,285
Speaker 2:  true than it was even just a couple of years ago that a lot of the stuff

991
01:05:27,285 --> 01:05:31,005
Speaker 2:  you're describing used to be a lot of work and now it's a lot of

992
01:05:31,005 --> 01:05:34,645
Speaker 2:  like battery maintenance. And that's kind of it in a lot of these cases,

993
01:05:35,085 --> 01:05:38,205
Speaker 2:  especially like I think about Ring has done a really good job of this, of

994
01:05:38,205 --> 01:05:42,045
Speaker 2:  making it basically that you can just hang a doorbell on your wall

995
01:05:42,065 --> 01:05:45,565
Speaker 2:  and like I have a lot of feelings about people in, especially like apartment

996
01:05:45,845 --> 01:05:49,805
Speaker 2:  buildings and condo buildings who have video doorbells that just go

997
01:05:49,805 --> 01:05:53,685
Speaker 2:  out into the hallway. Yeah. I have a lot of like moral quandaries with

998
01:05:53,685 --> 01:05:57,165
Speaker 2:  that. But the idea of what it can accomplish for you, this stuff in general

999
01:05:57,265 --> 01:06:00,685
Speaker 2:  is a lot simpler than it gets credit for for people. I think now, especially

1000
01:06:00,685 --> 01:06:03,925
Speaker 2:  if you've gone through the work to set up a raspberry pie running Home Assistant,

1001
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:07,245
Speaker 2:  like you have the chops to do most of the smart home stuff that is available

1002
01:06:07,245 --> 01:06:07,885
Speaker 2:  to you at this point.

1003
01:06:08,225 --> 01:06:12,085
Speaker 16:  For sure. Yeah. And there is, there's a lot. And in terms of the doorbell,

1004
01:06:12,365 --> 01:06:15,925
Speaker 16:  actually I just, this actually happened last week, so this is news for you

1005
01:06:15,925 --> 01:06:19,445
Speaker 16:  on the, the Vergecast. Arlo has some good battery powered

1006
01:06:19,645 --> 01:06:22,765
Speaker 16:  doorbells and their first generation one just became

1007
01:06:23,195 --> 01:06:26,845
Speaker 16:  HomeKit compatible. Oh, cool. There was only one battery powered doorbell

1008
01:06:26,845 --> 01:06:30,325
Speaker 16:  that worked with Apple Home before. That was the A Cara. Now the

1009
01:06:30,835 --> 01:06:34,685
Speaker 16:  Arlo essential first gen battery powered doorbell will work

1010
01:06:34,685 --> 01:06:38,205
Speaker 16:  with home kits. So not home kit secure video, but with home kits. So Chris,

1011
01:06:38,225 --> 01:06:41,845
Speaker 16:  if you were thinking about a video doorbell, those two would be a good option.

1012
01:06:41,995 --> 01:06:45,845
Speaker 16:  Cameras are a whole different thing and as you say, especially if you are

1013
01:06:45,845 --> 01:06:48,805
Speaker 16:  recording your neighbors walk past your house every morning, but if that's

1014
01:06:48,805 --> 01:06:52,285
Speaker 16:  something you're interested in, those are two good options. And a door lock

1015
01:06:52,345 --> 01:06:56,125
Speaker 16:  and then motion, get some sensors, get get your house to be really smart.

1016
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:56,965
Speaker 16:  And that's really fun.

1017
01:06:57,565 --> 01:07:01,165
Speaker 2:  I think especially if, if you're the type who wants to sort of experiment

1018
01:07:01,185 --> 01:07:04,565
Speaker 2:  and play, just adding sensors and smart plugs to everything you can think

1019
01:07:04,565 --> 01:07:08,405
Speaker 2:  of opens up so many things. And for me it's like most of the stuff that I've

1020
01:07:08,405 --> 01:07:12,165
Speaker 2:  tried ends up being sort of useless, but just the, it's just fun to

1021
01:07:12,165 --> 01:07:15,885
Speaker 2:  play with and be like, okay, whenever I get to like the fourth

1022
01:07:15,995 --> 01:07:19,445
Speaker 2:  step to the basement, what should turn on? I don't even know. Let's just

1023
01:07:19,445 --> 01:07:23,245
Speaker 2:  have some stuff happen and it's just, yeah, just that And, and the sensors

1024
01:07:23,245 --> 01:07:25,765
Speaker 2:  are cheap and they're everywhere and they're easy to pick up and move around

1025
01:07:25,825 --> 01:07:29,125
Speaker 2:  and I think, I think that's a good call. Just like buy some sensors,

1026
01:07:29,575 --> 01:07:32,805
Speaker 2:  spend a Saturday playing with them and and see what works for you. I like

1027
01:07:32,805 --> 01:07:33,565
Speaker 2:  that a lot. See

1028
01:07:33,565 --> 01:07:33,965
