00:00:02,555 --> 00:00:06,285
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Enterprise Certificate

3
00:00:06,285 --> 00:00:09,765
Speaker 2:  Hacks. I'm your friend David Pierce and I am having a project day.

4
00:00:10,325 --> 00:00:14,205
Speaker 2:  I feel like being an adult is just like a long unending list

5
00:00:14,225 --> 00:00:18,005
Speaker 2:  of maintenance tasks. There's always things to hang up and things to take

6
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:21,845
Speaker 2:  down and filters to change and sinks to clean. And did you know you're supposed

7
00:00:21,845 --> 00:00:25,245
Speaker 2:  to clean your garbage disposal and your dishwasher? Apparently.

8
00:00:25,595 --> 00:00:29,045
Speaker 2:  There's all kinds of stuff like that and rather than let it hang over my

9
00:00:29,045 --> 00:00:32,845
Speaker 2:  head, I've discovered that what works for me is to just keep a long running

10
00:00:32,915 --> 00:00:36,245
Speaker 2:  list and then once a month or so, whenever I'm feeling

11
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:40,125
Speaker 2:  particularly energetic and have some time, I try to just knock

12
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:43,725
Speaker 2:  out as many of those things as I can, right? It just feels better. And most

13
00:00:43,725 --> 00:00:47,565
Speaker 2:  of those tasks take like one to five minutes anyway so I can get up,

14
00:00:47,785 --> 00:00:50,725
Speaker 2:  do a whole bunch when I'm feeling energetic or have a show I wanna watch

15
00:00:50,725 --> 00:00:54,085
Speaker 2:  or whatever and then it's done. And then I don't have to think about it for

16
00:00:54,085 --> 00:00:57,285
Speaker 2:  a month. I'm sure there are a million things that are supposed to be on that

17
00:00:57,285 --> 00:01:00,485
Speaker 2:  list that I don't even know about, but I've made it this far. I don't wanna

18
00:01:00,485 --> 00:01:04,045
Speaker 2:  know. I'm sure it'll cause me pain and I'll deal with it as it comes. That's

19
00:01:04,045 --> 00:01:07,765
Speaker 2:  what being an adult is, right? Anyway, we have an awesome show coming up

20
00:01:07,765 --> 00:01:11,325
Speaker 2:  for you today. We're gonna do two things. We're gonna talk a bunch about

21
00:01:11,325 --> 00:01:14,645
Speaker 2:  the Delta emulator because that little retro game emulator

22
00:01:15,105 --> 00:01:18,805
Speaker 2:  has kind of taken over the app store the last couple of weeks and it turns

23
00:01:18,825 --> 00:01:22,685
Speaker 2:  out its story is both longer and weirder

24
00:01:22,705 --> 00:01:26,325
Speaker 2:  and more interesting and maybe more reflective of kind of the whole

25
00:01:26,325 --> 00:01:29,685
Speaker 2:  evolution of the tech industry than you think. So we're gonna talk to the

26
00:01:29,685 --> 00:01:33,405
Speaker 2:  person who made Delta about the whole journey to get here and what it says

27
00:01:33,535 --> 00:01:37,245
Speaker 2:  about where we might be going next. After that, we're gonna talk about AI

28
00:01:37,245 --> 00:01:40,965
Speaker 2:  because I've been testing AI gadgets, AI apps, AI

29
00:01:41,245 --> 00:01:45,085
Speaker 2:  platforms, AI everything for like a year and a half now. And

30
00:01:45,395 --> 00:01:49,085
Speaker 2:  I've found one use case for me that is perfect and it's awesome

31
00:01:49,345 --> 00:01:52,845
Speaker 2:  and I want to tell you about it. And this probably won't surprise you, but

32
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:56,285
Speaker 2:  it does involve talking into a microphone. We're also gonna answer The Vergecast

33
00:01:56,355 --> 00:02:00,165
Speaker 2:  hotline. Question about the Rabbit R one. We got lots to do. Super

34
00:02:00,185 --> 00:02:03,885
Speaker 2:  fun show. All that is coming up in just a second. But first I just noticed

35
00:02:04,155 --> 00:02:08,125
Speaker 2:  this like pile of laundry and socks behind me and it's starting to

36
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:11,885
Speaker 2:  stress me out. So I'm gonna go deal with that Project number one off the

37
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:14,045
Speaker 2:  list. This is the first cast. We'll be right back.

40
00:03:31,195 --> 00:03:34,885
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. For all of the last two weeks, the most

41
00:03:34,885 --> 00:03:38,725
Speaker 2:  popular app in the Apple app store has been a game emulator called Delta.

42
00:03:39,295 --> 00:03:42,365
Speaker 2:  We've been talking a lot about Delta on this show over the last few weeks,

43
00:03:42,795 --> 00:03:46,525
Speaker 2:  both because it's a huge hit and because it seems like

44
00:03:46,615 --> 00:03:50,405
Speaker 2:  maybe the start of a new era for the app store, like in the

45
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:54,365
Speaker 2:  history books of smartphone apps, there might be a before

46
00:03:54,455 --> 00:03:58,365
Speaker 2:  Delta and an after Delta for lots of reasons. But there's actually

47
00:03:58,365 --> 00:04:02,325
Speaker 2:  nothing even remotely new about Delta. The story of this

48
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:06,045
Speaker 2:  app is actually a full decade long and it starts with this guy,

49
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:10,045
Speaker 6:  I'm Ri Testa and I'm the founder of alt store developer of Delta.

50
00:04:10,535 --> 00:04:10,885
Speaker 6:  Riley

51
00:04:10,945 --> 00:04:14,925
Speaker 2:  Has had, as you might expect, a pretty wild few weeks in

52
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:17,685
Speaker 2:  the middle of it all. I asked him to come on the show and just tell me the

53
00:04:17,685 --> 00:04:21,045
Speaker 2:  whole Delta story, why he wanted to build an emulator in the first place,

54
00:04:21,305 --> 00:04:25,285
Speaker 2:  how the regulatory and technological world changed around him and

55
00:04:25,505 --> 00:04:29,445
Speaker 2:  in general, how Delta went from a big hack to a big hit.

56
00:04:29,705 --> 00:04:33,445
Speaker 2:  It starts with RI in high school, just kind of looking for something to do.

57
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:38,165
Speaker 6:  I was just back in high school, I think it was my junior year and I just

58
00:04:38,585 --> 00:04:42,565
Speaker 6:  one day came across just like the open source repo for

59
00:04:42,805 --> 00:04:46,245
Speaker 6:  a jailbreak game boy Van Simulator, GPS phone. And

60
00:04:46,765 --> 00:04:50,645
Speaker 6:  I was like, oh this is cool. This is all the code. I can probably just download

61
00:04:50,645 --> 00:04:53,805
Speaker 6:  this and tweak it and then put it on my own phone without having to jailbreak

62
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,885
Speaker 6:  because yeah, I've never been a fan of jailbreaking, it's just never really

63
00:04:56,885 --> 00:05:00,645
Speaker 6:  appealed to me. So I found this code base, I hacked out

64
00:05:00,645 --> 00:05:04,605
Speaker 6:  away for a couple months, put it on my phone, I put

65
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:07,965
Speaker 6:  it on a few of my friends' phones, they liked it and then I uploaded it to

66
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:11,365
Speaker 6:  GitHub and called it GB Afri West and then

67
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:15,685
Speaker 6:  kind of left it there for a bit and then people

68
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:19,525
Speaker 6:  found it on GitHub and started talking about it. And so I was like, oh,

69
00:05:19,635 --> 00:05:21,045
Speaker 6:  there's interest in this kind of thing.

70
00:05:21,745 --> 00:05:24,805
Speaker 2:  So you just made it as, as sort of a, it sounds like a mix of like a thing

71
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:27,565
Speaker 2:  that you thought would be useful and just kind of a thing to do.

72
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,965
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I just wanted Pokemon on my phone. That was literally just, I found

73
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:34,845
Speaker 6:  this, I was like, oh cool, I can Pokemon on my phone now and that's awesome.

74
00:05:34,945 --> 00:05:37,725
Speaker 6:  And that's really all I was thinking at the time. And then I put on my friend's

75
00:05:37,725 --> 00:05:41,085
Speaker 6:  phones and then we were playing just Pokemon ourselves. And then just completely

76
00:05:41,085 --> 00:05:44,445
Speaker 6:  coincidentally, there was this service that came out around the same time

77
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:48,525
Speaker 6:  that let you connect, like get open source GitHub projects and

78
00:05:48,835 --> 00:05:51,765
Speaker 6:  sign it with Apple's enterprise certificate. Basically there's a company

79
00:05:51,765 --> 00:05:54,725
Speaker 6:  that had enterprise certificate and you could just connect your GitHub account

80
00:05:54,785 --> 00:05:58,605
Speaker 6:  and then resign your apps like that. And so I was like, oh cool,

81
00:05:58,715 --> 00:06:02,165
Speaker 6:  I'll connect this to GBA for iOS and then people can install it outside the

82
00:06:02,165 --> 00:06:05,085
Speaker 6:  app store. Maybe a few people will download it. And that's basically when

83
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:09,085
Speaker 6:  I learned, oh wait, there's a huge demand for this thing. Oh

84
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:13,045
Speaker 6:  interesting. I did that and then within like a week people were like

85
00:06:13,045 --> 00:06:16,605
Speaker 6:  posting videos about how to install it. There were lots of Reddit posts and

86
00:06:16,645 --> 00:06:19,725
Speaker 6:  I was like honestly caught off guard. 'cause at this point it was still just

87
00:06:19,845 --> 00:06:22,805
Speaker 6:  a project I made for me and my friends like in high school. And so right

88
00:06:22,955 --> 00:06:26,885
Speaker 6:  then I was like, okay, there's demand for this thing. Let's take this seriously.

89
00:06:27,015 --> 00:06:30,365
Speaker 6:  Let's like build like a real version of this app that's not like throwing

90
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:33,845
Speaker 6:  together not hacky. And so that's when I got my friend Paul Thorson

91
00:06:34,345 --> 00:06:37,965
Speaker 6:  on board, my also still in high school. And we were like, we're gonna do

92
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:41,525
Speaker 6:  a brand new version of GBA, fry Wests, GBA, fry Wests 2.0. We're gonna

93
00:06:41,885 --> 00:06:44,405
Speaker 6:  redesign it from the ground up, just build it and make a really polished

94
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:48,365
Speaker 6:  experience. And so we basically spent all of senior year working

95
00:06:48,425 --> 00:06:52,405
Speaker 6:  on that and in like halfway through senior year we released GBA

96
00:06:52,405 --> 00:06:56,205
Speaker 6:  for iOS 2.0 and that's the version that most people know. That was the version

97
00:06:56,205 --> 00:06:59,765
Speaker 6:  that you installed from my website. You set your date back like 24 hours

98
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:03,645
Speaker 6:  and you can install it because of the weird bug that allowed enterprise certificates

99
00:07:03,645 --> 00:07:05,285
Speaker 6:  to work that way, even if they're expired.

100
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:09,165
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Wait, so real quick, just pause for a second and explain the enterprise

101
00:07:09,605 --> 00:07:13,485
Speaker 2:  certificate thing to be, because I feel like part of the story here is like

102
00:07:13,955 --> 00:07:17,765
Speaker 2:  Riley's adventures in figuring out how to install apps on phones.

103
00:07:18,185 --> 00:07:21,525
Speaker 6:  Yes. Yeah. Slowly getting more and more complicated. Yeah. Yeah. So this

104
00:07:21,585 --> 00:07:25,285
Speaker 6:  was the easiest hack is just, yeah, as long as I found an enterprise certificate,

105
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:29,605
Speaker 6:  I could just sign GBA for I os with it. And literally anyone could just

106
00:07:29,885 --> 00:07:31,885
Speaker 6:  download it from a website on the phone. Super simple.

107
00:07:32,145 --> 00:07:34,885
Speaker 2:  And the idea is basically it's like that's the certificate you would use

108
00:07:34,885 --> 00:07:38,525
Speaker 2:  if I'm like a company wanting my employees and no one else to have that app,

109
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:38,805
Speaker 2:  right?

110
00:07:38,955 --> 00:07:42,445
Speaker 6:  Yeah. The exact same flow. And so it's just, you're not supposed to do it

111
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:46,325
Speaker 6:  for this reason. And so what Apple normally would do is they would just

112
00:07:46,355 --> 00:07:49,685
Speaker 6:  like revoke the certificate, they'd make it, this is no longer valid and

113
00:07:49,685 --> 00:07:53,645
Speaker 6:  all apps that are signed with it can no longer be installed. And so the bug

114
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:57,165
Speaker 6:  that I took advantage of was apparently at this time, like in Iowa seven

115
00:07:57,705 --> 00:08:01,485
Speaker 6:  If, you just set your date back on your phone by more than an hour. The

116
00:08:01,485 --> 00:08:05,405
Speaker 6:  checks for whether a certificate is valid or not just don't work. They

117
00:08:05,405 --> 00:08:09,085
Speaker 6:  just don't do it. Sure, you did try to install GBA and Apple

118
00:08:09,085 --> 00:08:12,845
Speaker 6:  would've revoked the certificate, but because you set your date back, iOS

119
00:08:12,845 --> 00:08:16,805
Speaker 6:  was fine installing it. And so it was just like a really weird bug that I

120
00:08:16,805 --> 00:08:20,365
Speaker 6:  could take advantage of because there Apple couldn't do anything easily about

121
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:23,365
Speaker 6:  it. They had to actually fix iOS to address it. They couldn't just be like,

122
00:08:23,365 --> 00:08:27,045
Speaker 6:  okay, nope. Turn off certificate. It was about nine months later that they

123
00:08:27,045 --> 00:08:30,805
Speaker 6:  finally addressed it. And then that was when I moved on basically from

124
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:34,325
Speaker 6:  GBA for iOS is when they, it was like iOS 8.1, they

125
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,685
Speaker 6:  killed the date trick. It was literally on my birthday when it actually happened

126
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:40,965
Speaker 6:  and I was like, oh that's funny. But honestly at that point I just gone to

127
00:08:40,965 --> 00:08:44,365
Speaker 6:  college and so I was like, you know what, I'm gonna move on from this whole

128
00:08:44,365 --> 00:08:47,805
Speaker 6:  thing. GBA fires is really cool. I wanted to go on to the next thing.

129
00:08:48,065 --> 00:08:51,485
Speaker 2:  Do you know how many people were using GBA for iOS? Like at that sort of

130
00:08:51,485 --> 00:08:52,765
Speaker 2:  peak moment before it got shut down?

131
00:08:54,365 --> 00:08:58,205
Speaker 6:  A lot of people like more than 10 million for sure.

132
00:08:58,385 --> 00:09:02,325
Speaker 2:  Wow. Whoa. Yeah. That's like a zero or two bigger than I thought

133
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:02,925
Speaker 2:  you were gonna say.

134
00:09:03,115 --> 00:09:06,925
Speaker 6:  Yeah. There was a stupid amount of people using GBA Fire Wests, which

135
00:09:06,945 --> 00:09:10,605
Speaker 6:  is why I was so motivated to do this for this whole time was I just knew

136
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:14,205
Speaker 6:  that there was a market for this kind of thing that everyone just kind of

137
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:17,285
Speaker 6:  assumed there wasn't. But I'm like, no GVA got 10 million downloads outside

138
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:21,045
Speaker 6:  the app store. Like it's just people just really wanna do this, like play

139
00:09:21,045 --> 00:09:22,205
Speaker 6:  old games. Yeah.

140
00:09:22,555 --> 00:09:26,125
Speaker 2:  Okay. So you kind of, you, you're sort of forced to shut down that project

141
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:29,125
Speaker 2:  a little bit. Yeah. Was there a moment where you're like, okay, I'm ready

142
00:09:29,145 --> 00:09:33,125
Speaker 2:  to go to war with Apple, let's fight this to the death and figure out

143
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:36,805
Speaker 2:  how to get GBA for iOS back Or when it, when the sort of exploit gets shut

144
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:39,805
Speaker 2:  down, do you just kind of say, you know what, like you said, I'm going to

145
00:09:39,805 --> 00:09:43,365
Speaker 2:  college anyway, this is just a moment, let me focus on other things.

146
00:09:43,785 --> 00:09:46,125
Speaker 6:  It is basically that. Yeah. I was like, you know what, this is just a sign

147
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:49,805
Speaker 6:  that I should move on to something else. This was really cool. I'm glad I

148
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:52,845
Speaker 6:  got to do this, got a lot of experience but maybe I'll try to make an app

149
00:09:52,845 --> 00:09:54,965
Speaker 6:  in the app store next time. That was what I was thinking. I'm like, this

150
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:57,965
Speaker 6:  is a lot of work. Should have an app outside the app store. Yeah. So then

151
00:09:58,155 --> 00:10:01,085
Speaker 6:  that whole thought process lasted like a few months and then I got bored

152
00:10:01,265 --> 00:10:05,005
Speaker 6:  and I needed a new app to work on. And so yeah, swift had also just been

153
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:08,245
Speaker 6:  announced like the previous year and so I was like, oh you know what? Let

154
00:10:08,245 --> 00:10:12,125
Speaker 6:  just make another toy app for myself to learn Swift just for

155
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:15,125
Speaker 6:  me. And you know what? I'll make another emulator, it'll have more systems,

156
00:10:15,345 --> 00:10:18,525
Speaker 6:  but it's just for me like I'm again like it's just like a fun thing I wanted

157
00:10:18,525 --> 00:10:21,085
Speaker 6:  to work on to learn Swift. That was like my entire motivation. So

158
00:10:21,085 --> 00:10:24,685
Speaker 2:  You're just run the exact same playbook again. Yeah. Without even realizing

159
00:10:24,715 --> 00:10:25,205
Speaker 2:  Exactly.

160
00:10:25,285 --> 00:10:28,125
Speaker 6:  I was like, you know, I'm just gonna make for fun. Yeah, I know you'd think

161
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,005
Speaker 6:  I'd learn at some point.

162
00:10:30,075 --> 00:10:32,245
Speaker 2:  Okay, so and that's where Delta starts.

163
00:10:32,585 --> 00:10:35,845
Speaker 6:  Yes. And so that's the beginning of Delta was like, okay, I'll call it Delta

164
00:10:35,905 --> 00:10:38,965
Speaker 6:  and just build it for fun and that is what I thought I was gonna be working

165
00:10:38,965 --> 00:10:42,885
Speaker 6:  on. And then I went to WDC that year. It was my first

166
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:44,645
Speaker 6:  time ever at WDC. What year

167
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:45,245
Speaker 2:  Is this at this point?

168
00:10:45,265 --> 00:10:49,245
Speaker 6:  2015. Okay. So I go to WC and I talk to the

169
00:10:49,245 --> 00:10:52,405
Speaker 6:  app review team like 'cause they have like a lab there and I basically just

170
00:10:52,405 --> 00:10:56,125
Speaker 6:  say, Hey I'm working on this EM other app, is there any

171
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:59,645
Speaker 6:  world that it could be approved in the app store? And then they were like,

172
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:03,085
Speaker 6:  actually yeah, we'll allow that. You just gotta like comply with some weird

173
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:06,845
Speaker 6:  things. Basically they said I had to like submit a list of approved games

174
00:11:07,505 --> 00:11:10,165
Speaker 6:  to them whenever I submitted a version of Delta so that could, they could

175
00:11:10,165 --> 00:11:13,845
Speaker 6:  just make sure all the games that Delta supports were safe. Like they just

176
00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:17,085
Speaker 6:  didn't wanna have like an open pipeline of like games and everything. And

177
00:11:17,085 --> 00:11:20,285
Speaker 6:  so I was like okay fine that works for me. I'll submit a version of Delta

178
00:11:20,285 --> 00:11:23,205
Speaker 6:  to you and I'll have like a eight list of games that you can play and then

179
00:11:23,205 --> 00:11:26,805
Speaker 6:  every app update I'll expand it to include more games. And

180
00:11:27,185 --> 00:11:30,725
Speaker 6:  it seemed like that would be something I could do. And so I was really motivated.

181
00:11:30,785 --> 00:11:33,605
Speaker 6:  I'm like cool, I'm gonna get Delta in the app store. And so then I spent

182
00:11:33,905 --> 00:11:37,405
Speaker 6:  the next year like actually building it for real. I was like okay, this is

183
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:41,045
Speaker 6:  now a real app no longer just for me. I like really want it to be

184
00:11:41,045 --> 00:11:44,485
Speaker 6:  polished, I want to be good. I took a lot of my time. I got on my college

185
00:11:44,685 --> 00:11:48,365
Speaker 6:  schedule to be working on it and then I went to the WWE C

186
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:52,405
Speaker 6:  next year and I talked to the same person and I said, Hey, I'm

187
00:11:52,405 --> 00:11:55,085
Speaker 6:  ready to submit, can I submit it now? And he was just like,

188
00:11:56,915 --> 00:12:00,575
Speaker 6:  so I talked to some people we can't allow

189
00:12:00,575 --> 00:12:04,255
Speaker 6:  Ambulator and that was just all I got. I didn't get a

190
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:07,655
Speaker 6:  why. It was just like a, we can't allow that.

191
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,655
Speaker 6:  And I was just pissed off.

192
00:12:10,235 --> 00:12:14,215
Speaker 2:  Do you think this person was wrong the first time they told you it

193
00:12:14,215 --> 00:12:17,735
Speaker 2:  would happen or do you think something happened in that year and they changed

194
00:12:17,735 --> 00:12:18,135
Speaker 2:  their mind?

195
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,775
Speaker 6:  Honestly, I don't know. It's either one's possible. My guess is though that

196
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:24,735
Speaker 6:  they thought it was okay and then they talked to someone in the year and

197
00:12:24,735 --> 00:12:27,775
Speaker 6:  then maybe they just had discussions about it and then they came away basically

198
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:31,015
Speaker 6:  like it's not worth the risk because I think that's what it's been this whole

199
00:12:31,015 --> 00:12:33,975
Speaker 6:  time. Apple is just like, it's not worth the risk to allow these emit, there's

200
00:12:33,975 --> 00:12:37,375
Speaker 6:  just so much stuff that could open up. So I think they're just like, eh,

201
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,695
Speaker 6:  it's one kid, whatever, we don't need to allow his app in the app store and

202
00:12:40,695 --> 00:12:41,695
Speaker 6:  it'll be fine. And

203
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:45,015
Speaker 2:  At that point, I mean I I, I confess I was late to the

204
00:12:45,595 --> 00:12:49,495
Speaker 2:  iOS emulation universe, but it seems it's a weird thing

205
00:12:49,495 --> 00:12:53,415
Speaker 2:  like GBA for iOS was huge and then it kind of went away. And so I

206
00:12:53,415 --> 00:12:56,775
Speaker 2:  would assume we're back to like lots of pent up demand. People are very excited

207
00:12:56,775 --> 00:13:00,375
Speaker 2:  about it. So it's not like you're the first person in history to ask Apple

208
00:13:00,445 --> 00:13:04,215
Speaker 2:  this question, I'm sure. But at that point emulation was just kind of, it

209
00:13:04,215 --> 00:13:07,975
Speaker 2:  was sort of nowhere on the iPhone. So I guess for them to say no, we're going

210
00:13:07,975 --> 00:13:11,295
Speaker 2:  to continue to not allow it is not totally out of character.

211
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:15,255
Speaker 6:  Exactly. Like yeah, I wasn't surprised. I was just pissed off. Like I

212
00:13:15,255 --> 00:13:19,015
Speaker 6:  was just like, I wasted a year of my life working on this and

213
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,495
Speaker 6:  'cause you told me I could release it. That was really just all I was feeling.

214
00:13:21,805 --> 00:13:22,095
Speaker 6:  Yeah,

215
00:13:22,095 --> 00:13:25,615
Speaker 2:  That's fair. That's fair. So what do you, at that moment you're faced again

216
00:13:25,615 --> 00:13:29,295
Speaker 2:  with this same decision of like, okay, do I just call this a

217
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:32,015
Speaker 2:  successful project, I learned how to use Swift, let me just move on with

218
00:13:32,015 --> 00:13:35,895
Speaker 2:  my life or do I go the other way? I know the answer. Yeah, historically

219
00:13:36,095 --> 00:13:39,095
Speaker 2:  speaking but what, what is that? What do you, what is that moment like? Yeah

220
00:13:39,115 --> 00:13:42,495
Speaker 6:  And this time I was just so pissed off. I was just like, you know,

221
00:13:43,045 --> 00:13:46,935
Speaker 6:  this is not okay. I am gonna get this out there somehow. It's just

222
00:13:46,935 --> 00:13:49,855
Speaker 6:  like really what I came to and I did at that point I really didn't know what

223
00:13:49,855 --> 00:13:53,455
Speaker 6:  it would be but I was just like, I just wanted to show Apple that they can't

224
00:13:53,455 --> 00:13:55,935
Speaker 6:  treat developers kinda like this. It was really just like, I was like, you

225
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,575
Speaker 6:  can't treat us like this. You can't tell us one thing and then change your

226
00:13:58,575 --> 00:14:01,175
Speaker 6:  mind the next year 'cause real people are spending real time doing this kind

227
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:05,015
Speaker 6:  of thing. So I, yeah, I just motivated to just, I dunno, prove them

228
00:14:05,015 --> 00:14:08,055
Speaker 6:  wrong. This is the best I could say. And so yeah, I was like I'll figure

229
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:08,615
Speaker 6:  out a way.

230
00:14:08,995 --> 00:14:12,895
Speaker 2:  So then next project is figure out a way like how do you,

231
00:14:12,915 --> 00:14:13,895
Speaker 2:  how do you even start?

232
00:14:14,335 --> 00:14:18,295
Speaker 6:  I just got lucky honestly, apple had also just around that time made it so

233
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:22,135
Speaker 6:  that you can install apps from Xcode for free with

234
00:14:22,255 --> 00:14:26,095
Speaker 6:  a free Apple id. Like they just changed that rule of right around now so

235
00:14:26,095 --> 00:14:29,975
Speaker 6:  that students could start developing. And so I saw that and I was like, wait,

236
00:14:30,155 --> 00:14:33,895
Speaker 6:  you can install apps for free If, you just have an Apple id. There's

237
00:14:33,895 --> 00:14:37,255
Speaker 6:  something there. Like I was like that's all the technical thing I needed

238
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:40,375
Speaker 6:  to, I could make something from that. And so that was just like the beginning

239
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:44,255
Speaker 6:  of Alt Store was like, okay, I gotta do something with this free Apple

240
00:14:44,555 --> 00:14:47,895
Speaker 6:  ID side loading from Xcode thing that Apple has just announced.

241
00:14:48,915 --> 00:14:52,285
Speaker 6:  And then I was basically just like took a few years to

242
00:14:52,885 --> 00:14:56,605
Speaker 6:  research that, build it up, find out what would be the most convenient flow

243
00:14:56,805 --> 00:14:59,245
Speaker 6:  'cause yeah, there are a lot of obstacles with that. It was apps installed

244
00:14:59,245 --> 00:15:03,085
Speaker 6:  this way only could last seven days. You could only have three apps installed

245
00:15:03,085 --> 00:15:06,605
Speaker 6:  at a time this method. So it was just like kind of trying to come up with

246
00:15:07,485 --> 00:15:11,445
Speaker 6:  creative ways to make a lot of these restrictions not as annoying. Like the

247
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:14,365
Speaker 6:  fact that Alt Server's a thing was the number one that alt server could just

248
00:15:14,365 --> 00:15:17,685
Speaker 6:  refresh your apps every week in the background. And when I thought of that,

249
00:15:17,705 --> 00:15:21,685
Speaker 6:  that's when I was like, okay, I think there's something here we can

250
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:23,005
Speaker 6:  at least work with that's good enough.

251
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:27,285
Speaker 2:  So when did the first version of alt store like work,

252
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:29,965
Speaker 2:  what was sort of the first version of it that you had that you were like,

253
00:15:29,965 --> 00:15:32,205
Speaker 2:  okay this, this does the thing that I need it to do?

254
00:15:33,285 --> 00:15:37,125
Speaker 6:  I think that was 2019 is when I finally like had put

255
00:15:37,325 --> 00:15:41,165
Speaker 6:  together all the pieces into One Flow, whereas in like I had a program

256
00:15:41,225 --> 00:15:44,805
Speaker 6:  on a computer that could install Alt store onto my phone and then Alt Store

257
00:15:44,805 --> 00:15:48,685
Speaker 6:  could send apps to that device or to my computer and then reinstall it. And

258
00:15:48,685 --> 00:15:52,645
Speaker 6:  then it was early 2019 I was like, okay, this can

259
00:15:52,645 --> 00:15:55,685
Speaker 6:  work. Okay. Like just seeing it actually work in practice, it was totally

260
00:15:55,775 --> 00:15:58,925
Speaker 6:  janky. Like the UI was horrible, but just like the fact I could press a button

261
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:02,445
Speaker 6:  on my phone and it would do everything, send it to Alt Server and install

262
00:16:02,445 --> 00:16:03,925
Speaker 6:  it was just honestly kind of magical.

263
00:16:04,425 --> 00:16:08,365
Speaker 2:  So explain to me why that worked okay in in the sort of infrastructure of

264
00:16:08,555 --> 00:16:11,565
Speaker 2:  Apple's universe. Like why did that system work?

265
00:16:11,795 --> 00:16:15,725
Speaker 6:  Because, so the way Apple allows students to test out their apps

266
00:16:16,065 --> 00:16:19,605
Speaker 6:  is they have to have a Mac and they have to be using Xcode and they have

267
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:23,525
Speaker 6:  to plug their phone into Xcode and then they have to install an app from

268
00:16:23,655 --> 00:16:27,245
Speaker 6:  Xcode onto the phone. Like you can't just download a file and do it. It's

269
00:16:27,245 --> 00:16:30,965
Speaker 6:  all through Xcode and all through a computer. And so Alt Server

270
00:16:31,745 --> 00:16:35,685
Speaker 6:  is basically replicating everything Xcode does. You can have an

271
00:16:35,685 --> 00:16:38,885
Speaker 6:  app file, but iOS can't install an app file on itself. You have to send it

272
00:16:38,885 --> 00:16:42,845
Speaker 6:  to a computer. And then Alt Server does the same stuff Xcode

273
00:16:42,845 --> 00:16:46,045
Speaker 6:  does behind the scenes to install it back onto the phone as if you're a developer

274
00:16:46,045 --> 00:16:46,885
Speaker 6:  testing out yourself.

275
00:16:47,265 --> 00:16:50,645
Speaker 2:  Got it. Okay. And you were able to basically build a thing that lets

276
00:16:50,865 --> 00:16:54,725
Speaker 2:  anyone kind of mimic that system for themselves? Yes. When I

277
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:58,045
Speaker 2:  set it up it was, I wouldn't say it was a lot of work, but it wasn't no work.

278
00:16:58,485 --> 00:16:58,725
Speaker 2:  It's,

279
00:16:58,755 --> 00:17:02,725
Speaker 6:  Yeah, it's a lot. It's a bit, yeah. Especially on the Mac, there's the

280
00:17:02,725 --> 00:17:06,685
Speaker 6:  mail plugin for a long time that was just, oh yeah, really it

281
00:17:06,685 --> 00:17:10,205
Speaker 6:  was, yeah, it was confusing to everyone and I was like, oh this is too nerdy

282
00:17:10,205 --> 00:17:13,965
Speaker 6:  to try to explain even to people why it matters but just, yeah. Yeah, people

283
00:17:13,985 --> 00:17:14,445
Speaker 6:  got through it.

284
00:17:15,355 --> 00:17:18,605
Speaker 2:  Well so, and this is, this is, I feel like the, the sort of ongoing story

285
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:21,925
Speaker 2:  here is you're, you're finding these increasingly complicated ways to do

286
00:17:21,925 --> 00:17:25,885
Speaker 2:  this and continuing discover that there is so much demand for something

287
00:17:25,885 --> 00:17:29,285
Speaker 2:  like Delta that people will jump through basically any hoops that you ask

288
00:17:29,285 --> 00:17:30,765
Speaker 2:  them to jump through in order to do this.

289
00:17:31,235 --> 00:17:34,685
Speaker 6:  Yeah, the biggest thing I was surprised about with all stores, we need to

290
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:38,605
Speaker 6:  get your Apple ID and password to like log in with your account.

291
00:17:38,905 --> 00:17:42,325
Speaker 6:  And I was like, wow, we really are just asking people to trust us and give

292
00:17:42,325 --> 00:17:45,485
Speaker 6:  us your Apple ID of password. And I mean we're, we do everything we can with

293
00:17:45,485 --> 00:17:47,805
Speaker 6:  it. We literally don't touch ourselves, we send it straight to Apple. But

294
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:51,885
Speaker 6:  I was like, ooh, that's a big scary thing that you really just

295
00:17:52,185 --> 00:17:54,605
Speaker 6:  aren't supposed to give your password to random people. And then nope, people

296
00:17:54,605 --> 00:17:57,685
Speaker 6:  are still giving us their password as if they don't care. I'm like, this

297
00:17:57,685 --> 00:18:01,165
Speaker 6:  is cool. But also it makes you nervous for security as a whole that people

298
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:02,485
Speaker 6:  are just doing, just not thinking about it.

299
00:18:02,905 --> 00:18:05,645
Speaker 2:  Oh, for sure. And it puts you in a really interesting position I would think

300
00:18:05,665 --> 00:18:09,405
Speaker 2:  as the, as the developer of this to say okay, what is

301
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:13,205
Speaker 2:  this thing? Like am I just building this as sort of a fun side

302
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:16,565
Speaker 2:  project for people who wanna play Pokemon on their phones? Which comes with

303
00:18:16,645 --> 00:18:20,485
Speaker 2:  I think one set of like security and privacy. Yes. Implications.

304
00:18:20,485 --> 00:18:24,445
Speaker 2:  Like to some extent honestly If, you send your Apple ID and password

305
00:18:24,465 --> 00:18:28,205
Speaker 2:  to just a dude, I don't think you have any reasonable expectation of privacy.

306
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:31,405
Speaker 2:  Exactly. Like I think it's good thing that you were taking care of people's

307
00:18:31,475 --> 00:18:35,125
Speaker 2:  privacy as best you could. But I think for me as the user, I

308
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,845
Speaker 2:  deserve what I'm getting at that point, right? Yeah. Yeah. But then if you're,

309
00:18:37,845 --> 00:18:40,845
Speaker 2:  if you're like a company that is, that has a terms of service and is set

310
00:18:40,845 --> 00:18:43,205
Speaker 2:  up to make money and you're like, we're in this for the long haul and we're

311
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:47,045
Speaker 2:  serious about it, I think that changes both the way you have to

312
00:18:47,045 --> 00:18:50,325
Speaker 2:  treat stuff and the way that I can expect you to treat stuff. Yes. And it

313
00:18:50,325 --> 00:18:52,685
Speaker 2:  seems like as you were going through this, you were also trying to decide

314
00:18:53,195 --> 00:18:56,765
Speaker 2:  like how professionalized do I want this thing to be?

315
00:18:57,065 --> 00:18:58,005
Speaker 2:  Is that, is that fair?

316
00:18:58,225 --> 00:19:01,125
Speaker 6:  That's pretty fair because when the first version of Al Store that launched

317
00:19:01,545 --> 00:19:05,365
Speaker 6:  was literally just like a Delta installer. The only app in it was

318
00:19:05,365 --> 00:19:09,205
Speaker 6:  Delta. It could install Delta. And I just knew that was

319
00:19:09,205 --> 00:19:12,525
Speaker 6:  important. But even at that point I knew I wanted alt store to be a bigger

320
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:15,605
Speaker 6:  platform. That was like kind of what motivated it was like I didn't wanna

321
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:19,125
Speaker 6:  build a whole nother workaround just to install Delta. The fact that I could

322
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:22,245
Speaker 6:  do it for alt store and for other apps too made it more appealing to me.

323
00:19:22,325 --> 00:19:25,405
Speaker 6:  I was like fine, I can do the work and then lots of other apps can take advantage

324
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:28,965
Speaker 6:  of it. And so it was always the plan to expand beyond Delta,

325
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:33,085
Speaker 6:  but I just didn't know really what that would look like until probably like

326
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,525
Speaker 6:  a year or so after we launched and I started, we started actually having

327
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:39,285
Speaker 6:  some third party apps wanting to be on the store. And then I got a sense

328
00:19:39,285 --> 00:19:43,045
Speaker 6:  of, okay, this is the type of apps people wanted to install, this is what

329
00:19:43,045 --> 00:19:45,885
Speaker 6:  I gotta be dealing with. And yeah, that's helped a lot.

330
00:19:46,145 --> 00:19:50,045
Speaker 2:  See so what, what was that like? We're gonna get into the kind of history

331
00:19:50,135 --> 00:19:54,085
Speaker 2:  moved towards you a little bit aspect of this in just a sec, but I

332
00:19:54,085 --> 00:19:57,645
Speaker 2:  am curious in that moment the idea of like, I'm gonna get my third party

333
00:19:57,745 --> 00:20:01,645
Speaker 2:  app store to be sort of, you know, legitimate in Apple size.

334
00:20:01,645 --> 00:20:05,565
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Was completely off the table like 20 19, 20 20. There was just no world

335
00:20:05,565 --> 00:20:08,405
Speaker 2:  in which that was gonna happen. But you're like, you're talking about, you

336
00:20:08,405 --> 00:20:11,365
Speaker 2:  know, other apps that want to do this kind of stuff. What were you starting

337
00:20:11,385 --> 00:20:15,045
Speaker 2:  to see? What was kind of the, the like unifying thesis behind apps that

338
00:20:15,045 --> 00:20:16,565
Speaker 2:  wanted to be part of this thing you were doing?

339
00:20:17,445 --> 00:20:20,405
Speaker 6:  I, I mean at first it was just any app that wasn't allowed in the app store.

340
00:20:20,405 --> 00:20:24,205
Speaker 6:  Okay. And honestly is still a big appeal date. It's like for whatever

341
00:20:24,205 --> 00:20:27,245
Speaker 6:  reason that was rejected for whatever type of rule, they just could be the

342
00:20:27,245 --> 00:20:29,645
Speaker 6:  app store and so then they'd see alt store and then they'd be like, oh an

343
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:33,245
Speaker 6:  alternative. There are a lot of emulators like obviously. Sure. So there's

344
00:20:33,245 --> 00:20:36,605
Speaker 6:  plenty of those. There's stuff you can expect. Like I Torrent had like an

345
00:20:36,605 --> 00:20:39,445
Speaker 6:  app and so you can be like, yeah I can see why Apple wouldn't approve it.

346
00:20:39,465 --> 00:20:43,285
Speaker 6:  But stuff like that. UTM, the virtual machine app, just

347
00:20:43,515 --> 00:20:47,045
Speaker 6:  running Windows on your iPad, really cool. Not loud in the app store. So

348
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:51,045
Speaker 6:  it was just like a bunch of different random project or another

349
00:20:51,045 --> 00:20:54,685
Speaker 6:  one I liked that I think is really cool old os, if you've heard of that one.

350
00:20:54,825 --> 00:20:58,485
Speaker 6:  No it's so, it's like a high schooler just recreated iOS four

351
00:20:58,865 --> 00:21:02,765
Speaker 6:  in Swift ui and so it's just like the whole exp If, you open the app and

352
00:21:02,765 --> 00:21:05,885
Speaker 6:  it's the home screen from iOS four, you can open all the apps and it looks

353
00:21:05,885 --> 00:21:08,965
Speaker 6:  exactly like it did back in the day. Oh that's awesome. And it's really cool.

354
00:21:09,305 --> 00:21:12,845
Speaker 6:  And so it's just like, oh a fun little idea that not Latin app store.

355
00:21:13,185 --> 00:21:16,885
Speaker 6:  So it's, yeah, a bunch of stuff like that. So I launched alt store and the

356
00:21:16,885 --> 00:21:20,125
Speaker 6:  first year was really great but the first year was also a lot and it was

357
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:23,805
Speaker 6:  just me working on at the time. And then I honestly was like, what am

358
00:21:24,045 --> 00:21:28,005
Speaker 6:  I doing here? Am I gonna keep with alt store? Is this ever gonna be a real

359
00:21:28,005 --> 00:21:31,445
Speaker 6:  thing? Should I just like move on to something else now I was really going,

360
00:21:31,445 --> 00:21:34,445
Speaker 6:  trying to figure out what I wanna do and then it was really that point I

361
00:21:34,925 --> 00:21:38,565
Speaker 6:  realized what I wanted was I saw basically that the US was investigating

362
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:42,405
Speaker 6:  Apple and that the EU was investigating Apple around this time. And I was

363
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:45,765
Speaker 6:  like, you know what? I feel like there is gonna be something that happens

364
00:21:45,865 --> 00:21:49,845
Speaker 6:  in the next few years. I wanna be ready for that but I need help. And

365
00:21:49,845 --> 00:21:53,325
Speaker 6:  that's when I basically brought on my partner Shane Gill, who is my best

366
00:21:53,325 --> 00:21:56,765
Speaker 6:  friend and I've lived with for like 10 years. And I was like, Hey, I need

367
00:21:56,765 --> 00:22:00,565
Speaker 6:  you with this with me. I need just do it together. I need you to do all the

368
00:22:00,765 --> 00:22:03,885
Speaker 6:  business stuff. And so I can just focus on the programming and then we can

369
00:22:03,885 --> 00:22:07,805
Speaker 6:  make that happen. And at that point we started like making the

370
00:22:07,805 --> 00:22:11,285
Speaker 6:  plans for what alt store is today or at least an alt store in the EU alt

371
00:22:11,285 --> 00:22:11,605
Speaker 6:  store pal.

372
00:22:11,795 --> 00:22:15,405
Speaker 2:  Okay. So you, you actually really were betting on the theory that eventually

373
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:19,805
Speaker 2:  this was gonna be a real thing that you could do and not just sort

374
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:21,725
Speaker 2:  of a series of ever more elaborate attacks.

375
00:22:22,065 --> 00:22:26,045
Speaker 6:  Yes. Yeah. By that time I was convinced it would happen. Just I didn't

376
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:27,925
Speaker 6:  know when but just at some point in the future.

377
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:32,005
Speaker 2:  That's fair. Okay. So, and this was like peak covid.

378
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:35,725
Speaker 2:  If I'm, if I'm doing my timing math here correctly, everything's weird at

379
00:22:35,725 --> 00:22:37,845
Speaker 2:  this time and you're like, well let's, let's just go for it.

380
00:22:38,325 --> 00:22:41,605
Speaker 6:  Everything's weird. I'm, yeah, everyone's reevaluating their lives. My original

381
00:22:41,605 --> 00:22:44,645
Speaker 6:  plan was, I was like, Hey Shane, let's move to New Zealand together. Let's

382
00:22:44,645 --> 00:22:47,805
Speaker 6:  just escape everything. Let's build this in New Zealand. 'cause I'm a New Zealand

383
00:22:47,805 --> 00:22:51,645
Speaker 6:  citizen so it'd be cool to go home for me. But that didn't work out. It was

384
00:22:51,645 --> 00:22:54,565
Speaker 6:  too hard to get New Zealand during Covid. Yeah, understandably So. We're

385
00:22:54,565 --> 00:22:55,045
Speaker 6:  in Dallas now,

386
00:22:55,535 --> 00:22:55,885
Speaker 2:  Which

387
00:22:55,885 --> 00:22:57,125
Speaker 6:  Is the same thing. It's

388
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:57,965
Speaker 2:  Like this close, yeah.

389
00:22:58,215 --> 00:22:59,005
Speaker 6:  Space close.

390
00:23:00,315 --> 00:23:04,165
Speaker 2:  Okay. So you start building this thing and was the idea

391
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:08,325
Speaker 2:  we wanna build sort of a full app store? Like was that

392
00:23:08,325 --> 00:23:09,925
Speaker 2:  is is it as simple as that? That was the pitch.

393
00:23:10,285 --> 00:23:12,525
Speaker 6:  Yeah. When Shane Karen board, that was the full pitch. Like we're gonna build

394
00:23:12,645 --> 00:23:16,565
Speaker 6:  a real app store and show people what life could be like if there

395
00:23:16,565 --> 00:23:19,725
Speaker 6:  were other apps. Just like just be the example and then whenever it was official

396
00:23:19,725 --> 00:23:21,405
Speaker 6:  be the official like be an official store.

397
00:23:21,785 --> 00:23:24,565
Speaker 2:  And what was, what were developers saying? Were you like reaching out to

398
00:23:24,565 --> 00:23:27,085
Speaker 2:  folks being like, do you wanna be part of this and what were they telling

399
00:23:27,085 --> 00:23:27,245
Speaker 2:  you?

400
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:29,925
Speaker 6:  Honestly, we didn't need to be reaching out to anyone. People were just reaching

401
00:23:29,925 --> 00:23:33,565
Speaker 6:  out to us. Like there are a lot of people who just have app ideas that just

402
00:23:33,565 --> 00:23:36,845
Speaker 6:  aren't getting in the app store and just, and even I'm like, wow, there are

403
00:23:36,845 --> 00:23:40,085
Speaker 6:  just so many apps that like were getting like reaching out to us. I'm like

404
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,845
Speaker 6:  Oh wow, that was rejected. That was rejected. So we've just, yeah, people

405
00:23:43,845 --> 00:23:44,605
Speaker 6:  just reaching out for us.

406
00:23:44,995 --> 00:23:48,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And were you having any contact with Apple at this point? Obvi,

407
00:23:48,805 --> 00:23:52,205
Speaker 2:  other than you know, those two conversations at WBDC, was there any inclination

408
00:23:52,205 --> 00:23:54,805
Speaker 2:  that Apple was even sort of aware of your existence throughout this process?

409
00:23:55,665 --> 00:23:59,485
Speaker 6:  We did. At one point when the EU started investigating stuff,

410
00:24:00,145 --> 00:24:03,965
Speaker 6:  me and Shane sent an email to the executives at Apple basically saying,

411
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:08,205
Speaker 6:  Hey y'all, I think the EU may be going too much and do you

412
00:24:08,205 --> 00:24:11,645
Speaker 6:  like we just reach out, Hey like we're here and we don't want like a crazy

413
00:24:11,645 --> 00:24:15,525
Speaker 6:  world of side loading. Do you wanna like be on the same page here? And they

414
00:24:15,525 --> 00:24:18,965
Speaker 6:  didn't respond at all. But we were at the time just thinking we don't want

415
00:24:18,965 --> 00:24:22,485
Speaker 6:  a crazy free for all. And that's what it seemed like maybe the EU was gonna

416
00:24:22,485 --> 00:24:25,965
Speaker 6:  be, we wanted a more restricted siloing world where the app store

417
00:24:26,305 --> 00:24:29,925
Speaker 6:  was still the main app store. Why? I really think that's what makes

418
00:24:30,145 --> 00:24:33,405
Speaker 6:  iOS so good for like the vast majority people. Like it is just so simple

419
00:24:33,435 --> 00:24:37,245
Speaker 6:  that you can get any app that you trust through one store. I think

420
00:24:37,245 --> 00:24:41,165
Speaker 6:  that's really valuable. It's why like so many people I know personally use

421
00:24:41,165 --> 00:24:45,045
Speaker 6:  an iPhone that aren't techies. And so I just always knew that there

422
00:24:45,045 --> 00:24:48,685
Speaker 6:  needed to be a way for siloing to exist without taking over the app store

423
00:24:48,685 --> 00:24:50,085
Speaker 6:  or taking like so many apps away from it.

424
00:24:50,595 --> 00:24:54,525
Speaker 2:  Okay. So you then are watching the regulation stuff happening. Are you like

425
00:24:54,715 --> 00:24:58,525
Speaker 2:  barreling through all the, you know, DMA white papers and trying to

426
00:24:58,585 --> 00:25:01,965
Speaker 2:  get the deep sense of what's going? Like how into this were you as that

427
00:25:02,055 --> 00:25:03,165
Speaker 2:  regulation was happening

428
00:25:03,395 --> 00:25:06,885
Speaker 6:  Once the DMA was like an actual thing and they were talking about Oh yeah,

429
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:10,005
Speaker 6:  we were very much deep in it and then we were just like, we gotta be ready

430
00:25:10,025 --> 00:25:12,645
Speaker 6:  for anything li because literally until Apple announced what they were doing,

431
00:25:12,985 --> 00:25:16,925
Speaker 6:  we just were like, are we gonna be a siloing tool? Are we gonna be a a full

432
00:25:16,925 --> 00:25:20,645
Speaker 6:  app store? Are we gonna exist at all? Like we just had no idea what was gonna

433
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:24,045
Speaker 6:  come next. We just knew that there would be some way of installing apps.

434
00:25:24,515 --> 00:25:28,325
Speaker 2:  Okay. And so I guess with that idea you can kind of keep

435
00:25:28,525 --> 00:25:32,365
Speaker 2:  building Delta and alt store the way you had been without making too

436
00:25:32,435 --> 00:25:36,365
Speaker 2:  many kind of unchangeable decisions at

437
00:25:36,525 --> 00:25:36,845
Speaker 2:  that point?

438
00:25:37,385 --> 00:25:41,085
Speaker 6:  Yes. We basically were working on like stuff that we knew would be true

439
00:25:41,185 --> 00:25:45,085
Speaker 6:  no matter what. Like we were building up like the UI for browsing apps and

440
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,605
Speaker 6:  like we were expanding like, or building the Patreon flow so that people

441
00:25:48,605 --> 00:25:51,885
Speaker 6:  could connect their Patreons and and install that. 'cause we just knew no

442
00:25:51,885 --> 00:25:55,765
Speaker 6:  matter what, that would be good for this world. We just

443
00:25:55,765 --> 00:25:58,165
Speaker 6:  didn't go into like the really technical stuff about like the actual installing

444
00:25:58,165 --> 00:26:01,245
Speaker 6:  process. Right. It was just basically making the app look as much like a

445
00:26:01,245 --> 00:26:02,845
Speaker 6:  store as it could be. Yeah,

446
00:26:02,845 --> 00:26:06,005
Speaker 2:  That makes sense. And at that point, how are you thinking about like the

447
00:26:06,285 --> 00:26:08,445
Speaker 2:  business of Delta? You've been working on this thing for an awfully long

448
00:26:08,445 --> 00:26:11,605
Speaker 2:  time without making any money on it. I'm assuming there were conversations

449
00:26:11,605 --> 00:26:14,965
Speaker 2:  about like how do we, how do we all get rich from this thing that clearly

450
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:15,965
Speaker 2:  lots of people want?

451
00:26:16,485 --> 00:26:20,405
Speaker 6:  I, people do keep asking me but the thing that I've

452
00:26:20,525 --> 00:26:23,565
Speaker 6:  believed in and what Shane, like Shane, before he even joined Al Store, he

453
00:26:23,565 --> 00:26:26,165
Speaker 6:  was the one that convinced me to make a Patreon for all this in the first

454
00:26:26,165 --> 00:26:29,285
Speaker 6:  place. He was like, Hey, when you're working on Delta and Al Store just have

455
00:26:29,285 --> 00:26:33,165
Speaker 6:  a Patreon the side to support yourself. 'cause honestly I thought my original

456
00:26:33,165 --> 00:26:35,725
Speaker 6:  plan was to release Alt store and Delta and then move on to something else

457
00:26:35,785 --> 00:26:38,965
Speaker 6:  and like, like just let it exist and let people install it. But Shane was

458
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:42,925
Speaker 6:  the one telling me, no people wanna support creators right now. You

459
00:26:43,005 --> 00:26:46,485
Speaker 6:  should just have a Patreon that people wanna subscribe to and just support

460
00:26:46,485 --> 00:26:50,325
Speaker 6:  future development. And so I start, I launched alt store at that and

461
00:26:50,505 --> 00:26:54,485
Speaker 6:  it did really well. Like it has paid for everything ever since I launched,

462
00:26:54,485 --> 00:26:58,205
Speaker 6:  started Alt store. We really believe that's a really important thing that

463
00:26:58,205 --> 00:27:01,965
Speaker 6:  should exist. 'cause developers right now you can't sell apps

464
00:27:01,965 --> 00:27:05,885
Speaker 6:  through Paton in the app store. And it's just such a really good way I think

465
00:27:05,885 --> 00:27:09,405
Speaker 6:  for creators to build like a relationship with their audience and just

466
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:13,125
Speaker 6:  people also don't mind spending a few bucks to a person

467
00:27:13,385 --> 00:27:16,605
Speaker 6:  but they do mind spending a few bucks on an app. Yep. So it's just like very

468
00:27:16,605 --> 00:27:20,365
Speaker 6:  different relationship. And so we are basically just trying to really

469
00:27:20,365 --> 00:27:23,965
Speaker 6:  promote the Patreon idea. Our own income basically is just through the

470
00:27:23,965 --> 00:27:27,525
Speaker 6:  Patreon. We're still selling or having access to our betas for our

471
00:27:27,525 --> 00:27:31,365
Speaker 6:  patrons and that's worked out pretty well as a way of monetizing Delta

472
00:27:31,725 --> 00:27:31,925
Speaker 6:  honestly.

473
00:27:32,435 --> 00:27:35,605
Speaker 2:  Okay. Yeah, I mean even just the idea of thinking of an app developer as

474
00:27:35,645 --> 00:27:39,565
Speaker 2:  a creator in the same way that you think about like a content creator as

475
00:27:39,565 --> 00:27:43,205
Speaker 2:  a creator is really interesting and is totally not

476
00:27:43,425 --> 00:27:46,925
Speaker 2:  how most people perceive it. Right. Exactly. And and I think, I think it's

477
00:27:46,925 --> 00:27:50,045
Speaker 2:  coming around a little bit like personally at least I've seen a lot more

478
00:27:50,665 --> 00:27:54,565
Speaker 2:  of the sort of bootstrapped one person app become a

479
00:27:54,565 --> 00:27:57,765
Speaker 2:  thing that people like in a way that I didn't and they like associate the

480
00:27:57,765 --> 00:28:01,005
Speaker 2:  app with the person who makes it. Yes. Yeah. But I think for most people

481
00:28:01,155 --> 00:28:04,565
Speaker 2:  it's all so faceless, right? Yes. Like you just, it's just an app that exists.

482
00:28:04,645 --> 00:28:07,765
Speaker 2:  I don't know if it's made by one person or 10,000 and I don't care. I'm just

483
00:28:07,765 --> 00:28:11,045
Speaker 2:  mad that they're charging me money. Yep. And it's interesting to think that

484
00:28:11,045 --> 00:28:13,965
Speaker 2:  like maybe the business model is part of the problem there that because it

485
00:28:13,965 --> 00:28:17,325
Speaker 2:  all just sits in the app store and it is so divorced from

486
00:28:17,955 --> 00:28:21,285
Speaker 2:  personality and people that maybe that's the problem. So actually connecting

487
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:24,165
Speaker 2:  Patreon to that is, is a really interesting way of just changing the way

488
00:28:24,165 --> 00:28:27,685
Speaker 2:  people think about what like an app is and how it gets made.

489
00:28:27,955 --> 00:28:30,685
Speaker 6:  Yeah, exactly. And I'm so, yeah, I'm really excited for that. And I'll, another

490
00:28:30,685 --> 00:28:34,525
Speaker 6:  nice benefit is we can just have our apps be free

491
00:28:34,905 --> 00:28:38,365
Speaker 6:  and then people just get the betas and, but so it means there's no features

492
00:28:38,365 --> 00:28:42,245
Speaker 6:  that are locked behind paywalls like forever. It's just a, you can wait forever

493
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:46,245
Speaker 6:  and get it for free or If you just want early access, you can donate. And

494
00:28:46,245 --> 00:28:50,085
Speaker 6:  I think that's more appealing to people to like when they're trying to support

495
00:28:50,085 --> 00:28:53,925
Speaker 6:  an app versus, oh you've locked away a feature and now I can never use it

496
00:28:53,925 --> 00:28:57,605
Speaker 6:  unless I pay. It's like, yeah that difference I think makes a huge

497
00:28:57,675 --> 00:28:57,965
Speaker 6:  deal.

498
00:28:58,355 --> 00:29:02,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah, no, I, I totally agree. So, okay, so right before the

499
00:29:02,285 --> 00:29:06,045
Speaker 2:  DMA drops and I guess, what was it like March of this year

500
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:09,325
Speaker 2:  when Apple put out its third party app store plans?

501
00:29:09,825 --> 00:29:10,925
Speaker 6:  It was end of January. Yeah.

502
00:29:11,275 --> 00:29:14,925
Speaker 2:  Okay. So this year, yeah, this year. Apple right before that,

503
00:29:15,355 --> 00:29:19,245
Speaker 2:  what was kind of the status of Delta and alt store? It sounds

504
00:29:19,245 --> 00:29:23,205
Speaker 2:  like it's, it's growing. People are using it. Like how, how were things?

505
00:29:23,665 --> 00:29:27,365
Speaker 6:  Things were good. We had like at that point, like 4 million users on

506
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:31,405
Speaker 6:  alt store, like just existing. I was like, oh wow, this is going great.

507
00:29:31,925 --> 00:29:35,165
Speaker 6:  Things are going great. At Delta we had been prioritizing basically a new

508
00:29:35,165 --> 00:29:39,085
Speaker 6:  version of Delta 1.5 to release alongside

509
00:29:39,885 --> 00:29:43,805
Speaker 6:  whatever Apple announced. And so we just like, we're working on that. But

510
00:29:43,805 --> 00:29:47,725
Speaker 6:  then basically by January we're just like, okay, everything's in a good

511
00:29:47,755 --> 00:29:51,605
Speaker 6:  spot. We're ready to go. We just need to know what the hell is

512
00:29:51,605 --> 00:29:54,765
Speaker 6:  happening. And so we were just basically just waiting around to see like,

513
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:58,725
Speaker 6:  okay, we can do this. We have like the store had

514
00:29:58,725 --> 00:30:02,405
Speaker 6:  been finished by then, like all the UI was done, Delta was ready, clip was

515
00:30:02,405 --> 00:30:03,365
Speaker 6:  ready. So,

516
00:30:03,705 --> 00:30:07,445
Speaker 2:  So you, you have this thing and you're like, this exists, we made it, it's

517
00:30:07,445 --> 00:30:10,325
Speaker 2:  good. We have absolutely no idea what we're about to do with it.

518
00:30:10,355 --> 00:30:12,125
Speaker 6:  Exactly. That is exactly where we were.

519
00:30:12,235 --> 00:30:13,445
Speaker 2:  What a strange place to

520
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:15,805
Speaker 6:  Be. It was very strange. It was, yeah. 'cause we're just, every day we're

521
00:30:15,805 --> 00:30:19,365
Speaker 6:  like, what do we do? Like we can't move forward in a lot of things

522
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:22,805
Speaker 6:  but, so it was just a lot of planning and strategizing.

523
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:26,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that makes sense. So then end of January, apple drops

524
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:29,925
Speaker 2:  like a million press releases and technical documents about how all this

525
00:30:29,925 --> 00:30:31,965
Speaker 2:  is gonna work. What, what happens to you on that day? What do you do?

526
00:30:32,465 --> 00:30:35,565
Speaker 6:  Wow. What? That was a overwhelming day like for sure.

527
00:30:36,465 --> 00:30:39,965
Speaker 6:  And the first thing that we try to do is figure out, okay,

528
00:30:40,745 --> 00:30:43,965
Speaker 6:  can we exist at all in this new world? Because yeah, there's all these like

529
00:30:43,965 --> 00:30:46,165
Speaker 6:  restrictions and we're trying to figure out what the hell like an alternative

530
00:30:46,165 --> 00:30:49,925
Speaker 6:  marketplace is and we're like, and so yes we're, we spend that whole day

531
00:30:49,925 --> 00:30:53,765
Speaker 6:  basically trying just to parse what Apple's announced. And then we basically

532
00:30:53,765 --> 00:30:57,685
Speaker 6:  are like, okay, we think we can do this. We think we can

533
00:30:57,685 --> 00:31:01,165
Speaker 6:  meet the criteria if we get very creative. 'cause yeah, the criteria was

534
00:31:01,165 --> 00:31:05,045
Speaker 6:  like a lot of things like you needed to have like the standby

535
00:31:05,065 --> 00:31:08,885
Speaker 6:  letter, we need to have a subsidiary in the eu. Right.

536
00:31:08,945 --> 00:31:12,365
Speaker 6:  And just like a bunch of things that we just sat down like, okay,

537
00:31:12,825 --> 00:31:16,685
Speaker 6:  we gotta make all this happen in a month basically. 'cause we're like, okay,

538
00:31:16,685 --> 00:31:20,045
Speaker 6:  we have it until March 7th was like the DMA compliance day. I'm like, okay,

539
00:31:20,815 --> 00:31:24,645
Speaker 6:  let's set up a subsidiary. Let's get the standby figured out. Let's build

540
00:31:24,645 --> 00:31:26,965
Speaker 6:  everything. 'cause also they announced all the stuff we had to build and

541
00:31:26,965 --> 00:31:30,685
Speaker 6:  it's like, okay, let's build everything we need to do. And then for the next

542
00:31:30,735 --> 00:31:34,365
Speaker 6:  month was like extreme crunch time, just like getting

543
00:31:34,365 --> 00:31:37,925
Speaker 6:  everything done. Shane honestly was incredible. He was calling

544
00:31:38,465 --> 00:31:42,125
Speaker 6:  so many countries to figure out where we could incorporate. Oh wow. We finally

545
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:45,245
Speaker 6:  incorporated in Ireland. So we have a nice subsidiary in Ireland, which is

546
00:31:45,245 --> 00:31:49,045
Speaker 6:  great. He was the one talking to banks to get someone to

547
00:31:49,755 --> 00:31:53,405
Speaker 6:  believe in two people who are trying to do something crazy and they need

548
00:31:53,405 --> 00:31:53,885
Speaker 6:  this. Yeah.

549
00:31:53,885 --> 00:31:57,405
Speaker 2:  How hard was that process? You're like, so we build a game emulator and also

550
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:01,085
Speaker 2:  other app stores. I'm imagining a bunch of banks are just like, this is a

551
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,125
Speaker 2:  prank call and hang up on you

552
00:32:02,485 --> 00:32:06,085
Speaker 6:  A lot did. Yeah. It so many people just like wouldn't listen to us. It was

553
00:32:06,195 --> 00:32:09,605
Speaker 6:  true pure luck that we found one person lo, his name's Logan,

554
00:32:10,265 --> 00:32:14,205
Speaker 6:  he just like Morgan Stanley and he was just understood what

555
00:32:14,205 --> 00:32:17,685
Speaker 6:  we were doing and really wanted to go out of his way to help us.

556
00:32:18,225 --> 00:32:21,525
Speaker 6:  And I honestly, if we had not met Logan, I don't know if we would've got

557
00:32:21,525 --> 00:32:25,325
Speaker 6:  this all figured out, but he was like, okay, let's do this. I believe in

558
00:32:25,325 --> 00:32:29,285
Speaker 6:  y'all. I can work with my bosses. We can make it happen. That that was

559
00:32:29,285 --> 00:32:30,805
Speaker 6:  a big win getting that one for sure.

560
00:32:31,155 --> 00:32:34,885
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I mean I remember when the news came out thinking that there were

561
00:32:34,885 --> 00:32:37,165
Speaker 2:  like, you described a bunch of technical challenges, but there were always

562
00:32:37,165 --> 00:32:39,245
Speaker 2:  gonna be a bunch of technical challenges, right? Yeah. I feel like that you,

563
00:32:39,245 --> 00:32:43,045
Speaker 2:  you sort of know going in, there's gonna be a bunch of weird work you have

564
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:46,525
Speaker 2:  to do to get this thing to comply with what Apple wants. But the business

565
00:32:46,845 --> 00:32:50,325
Speaker 2:  challenges of just like the, the hoops you had to jump through as an

566
00:32:50,325 --> 00:32:54,205
Speaker 2:  organization seemed like they were designed to keep almost everybody out

567
00:32:54,805 --> 00:32:58,765
Speaker 2:  except for the, the truest of true believers

568
00:32:58,905 --> 00:33:02,805
Speaker 2:  and maybe just the most stubborn people building this thing.

569
00:33:02,905 --> 00:33:03,645
Speaker 6:  Yes, exactly.

570
00:33:03,865 --> 00:33:07,205
Speaker 2:  And, and part of me wonders if if going back a few months, apple just deeply

571
00:33:07,345 --> 00:33:11,245
Speaker 2:  underestimated your willing to your willingness to pick this fight after

572
00:33:11,305 --> 00:33:13,405
Speaker 2:  so many years of picking this fight. You're like, I've been through your

573
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,005
Speaker 2:  nonsense before Apple. Oh,

574
00:33:15,085 --> 00:33:18,325
Speaker 6:  I I, yeah, I know they were caught off guard. They, they told us that they,

575
00:33:18,325 --> 00:33:21,205
Speaker 6:  like when we, when we ended up going to the lab and everything, they just

576
00:33:21,205 --> 00:33:25,045
Speaker 6:  said straight up, oh we did not expect anyone to be

577
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:28,725
Speaker 6:  this prepared, especially as a two person team. They just did not expect

578
00:33:28,725 --> 00:33:30,525
Speaker 6:  us to be as prepared as we were. which I think

579
00:33:30,525 --> 00:33:31,205
Speaker 2:  It had to feel good.

580
00:33:31,545 --> 00:33:35,405
Speaker 6:  Oh it did feel good. I was like cool. But at the same time I was like, well

581
00:33:35,405 --> 00:33:38,445
Speaker 6:  then let us launch. It was like, cool. Okay, that's amazing. Let us launch,

582
00:33:38,655 --> 00:33:39,125
Speaker 6:  we're ready.

583
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:43,445
Speaker 2:  Was there any question for a team of two whether to invest all

584
00:33:43,445 --> 00:33:47,125
Speaker 2:  this time on something that at least for now and potentially forever

585
00:33:47,265 --> 00:33:50,405
Speaker 2:  is only going to exist in the eu? Like there's a lot of people in the eu

586
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:52,445
Speaker 2:  but there's a lot of people not in the EU also.

587
00:33:52,595 --> 00:33:56,485
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I mean, so two parts of like one, I do think this is gonna come outside

588
00:33:56,485 --> 00:33:59,845
Speaker 6:  the EU at some point. I think it's a just question of time. So

589
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,845
Speaker 6:  I, I expected to see within a few years it'll expand out to like, I don't

590
00:34:03,845 --> 00:34:07,645
Speaker 6:  know, Japan, United States eventually. So, so we viewed this as like the

591
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:11,085
Speaker 6:  beginning of a much longer process us to expand.

592
00:34:11,505 --> 00:34:15,485
Speaker 6:  But then the other thing was like we had nothing to lose. This is literally

593
00:34:15,485 --> 00:34:19,045
Speaker 6:  all we're doing. All our income is working on Al Store of Delta. We're like,

594
00:34:19,045 --> 00:34:22,685
Speaker 6:  well we might as well just go all the way with it. Like what else? Like why

595
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:22,845
Speaker 6:  not?

596
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:27,165
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I mean I think the long bet I think is probably a safe one. Again,

597
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:30,365
Speaker 2:  it's a question of how long it takes. Yeah. But it, I do think you're probably

598
00:34:30,365 --> 00:34:34,165
Speaker 2:  right. It also seems like you were in a position where even

599
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:38,085
Speaker 2:  if it didn't sort of immediately reach a ton of people, you were gonna get

600
00:34:38,145 --> 00:34:41,125
Speaker 2:  so much notice just because this is such a big thing and such a big change

601
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:45,085
Speaker 2:  that like I all of a sudden alt sort just appeared in so many headlines

602
00:34:45,305 --> 00:34:47,685
Speaker 2:  in like February and March of this year, which is like, yes.

603
00:34:47,715 --> 00:34:51,405
Speaker 6:  That was very, very surreal seeing that all of a sudden. Yeah.

604
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:54,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I mean it's so funny 'cause like explaining alt story to people, it's

605
00:34:54,685 --> 00:34:58,165
Speaker 2:  like, okay, it is this bizarre sort of convoluted

606
00:34:58,165 --> 00:35:01,165
Speaker 2:  experience where you have to set up a server and I'm seeing this in like

607
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,565
Speaker 2:  mainstream news articles.

608
00:35:02,925 --> 00:35:04,685
Speaker 6:  I know. I'm like, oh my God. It's

609
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,925
Speaker 2:  Like, oh my God, if my mom asked me what alt story is, I'm not gonna know

610
00:35:07,165 --> 00:35:08,445
Speaker 2:  how to answer that question for her.

611
00:35:08,645 --> 00:35:12,405
Speaker 6:  I same, I, yeah, I explained to my friends, I'm like, eh, don't worry.

612
00:35:12,515 --> 00:35:15,205
Speaker 6:  It's just a tool to install apps. That's it.

613
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:19,485
Speaker 2:  So, okay, so then we're almost to the present time, but I feel like we still

614
00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:22,285
Speaker 2:  have not gotten to the single wildest part of this whole timeline. Yeah,

615
00:35:22,285 --> 00:35:23,285
Speaker 6:  That's been accurate.

616
00:35:24,185 --> 00:35:27,405
Speaker 2:  So you're, you're building the store, things are going well, you launch,

617
00:35:27,885 --> 00:35:30,685
Speaker 2:  I think on launch day, right? March 7th, was it ready to go?

618
00:35:31,185 --> 00:35:35,165
Speaker 6:  No, we, we were ready. We were all ready

619
00:35:35,165 --> 00:35:38,565
Speaker 6:  to go and that was the beginning of like this frustration. So

620
00:35:38,945 --> 00:35:42,845
Speaker 6:  we were, yeah, we were invited to a lab in Cork for the Apple

621
00:35:42,905 --> 00:35:45,965
Speaker 6:  to like help us implement our backend and everything. So like a week long

622
00:35:46,025 --> 00:35:49,445
Speaker 6:  lab for us just to work with Apple Engineers to get everything working. So

623
00:35:49,445 --> 00:35:53,045
Speaker 6:  then we flew out to Cork, it was like the week before March 5th. So the end

624
00:35:53,045 --> 00:35:57,005
Speaker 6:  of it, the end of February, we flew out day one, I showed up, I said,

625
00:35:57,075 --> 00:36:00,925
Speaker 6:  okay, here's everything. We're ready to go. Can we launch? And then

626
00:36:01,235 --> 00:36:03,925
Speaker 6:  they were like, oh hold on.

627
00:36:04,035 --> 00:36:06,765
Speaker 2:  They expected you to show up and be like, I'd like to build an app store.

628
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:08,685
Speaker 2:  And instead you show up and you're like, I have built an app store.

629
00:36:08,685 --> 00:36:10,805
Speaker 6:  They literally, I really think they expected everyone to show up with like

630
00:36:10,945 --> 00:36:14,285
Speaker 6:  no code base, like to just start from scratch and how to do this. And yeah,

631
00:36:14,285 --> 00:36:17,845
Speaker 6:  so we show up and we're like, here's the entire product. It has store pages,

632
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:21,045
Speaker 6:  everything you could possibly need downloading works. And then they were

633
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:24,445
Speaker 6:  just like, oh wow. Yeah, just very clearly. Yeah, they were not expecting

634
00:36:24,445 --> 00:36:27,805
Speaker 6:  that. And so it basically was then, okay, so Monday I was like trying to

635
00:36:27,925 --> 00:36:31,005
Speaker 6:  pressure them, can we launch tomorrow? Can we launch tomorrow? I watch 71 4

636
00:36:31,005 --> 00:36:34,445
Speaker 6:  is coming out tomorrow, can we be there? And then it just

637
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:38,565
Speaker 6:  became clear that this whole process was gonna be much longer than

638
00:36:38,565 --> 00:36:42,445
Speaker 6:  we expected for a lot of boring reasons. Like basically just

639
00:36:42,445 --> 00:36:46,045
Speaker 6:  legal, like giving them documents, having them review documents,

640
00:36:46,535 --> 00:36:50,525
Speaker 6:  stuff like that. So I 74 came out and me and

641
00:36:50,525 --> 00:36:54,365
Speaker 6:  Shane were very bummed because we were like, we were ready to launch

642
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:58,245
Speaker 6:  on launch day. We were all ready to go and then, ugh. So that was

643
00:36:58,445 --> 00:36:58,685
Speaker 6:  frustrating.

644
00:36:59,025 --> 00:37:02,365
Speaker 2:  So how long did it take before you actually got the thing up and running

645
00:37:02,755 --> 00:37:06,725
Speaker 6:  Then? I think it was two months later. Like it was, yeah, it was April 17th.

646
00:37:07,035 --> 00:37:10,525
Speaker 6:  Like yeah, so yeah, from May, from March 5th to

647
00:37:10,525 --> 00:37:14,365
Speaker 6:  April 17th was just waiting. It's a month and a half. And

648
00:37:14,385 --> 00:37:17,765
Speaker 6:  so we did that and then, yeah, the reception was immediately just

649
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:21,965
Speaker 6:  phenomenal. People just so excited and, but then we also immediately saw,

650
00:37:22,295 --> 00:37:26,285
Speaker 6:  which we expected that Delta was the main story. Sure that Delta in the

651
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:29,805
Speaker 6:  app store was the big deal. But we had to figure out what to do and we knew

652
00:37:29,805 --> 00:37:32,605
Speaker 6:  that would be the outcome if we released Delta in the app store, that Delta

653
00:37:32,605 --> 00:37:36,005
Speaker 6:  would get like its big moments to be everywhere. And we just were like, you

654
00:37:36,005 --> 00:37:38,485
Speaker 6:  know what, that's fine. It's free marketing for alt store if everyone just

655
00:37:38,485 --> 00:37:40,965
Speaker 6:  knows about Delta and then they talk about it and then they get it through

656
00:37:41,085 --> 00:37:42,525
Speaker 6:  alt store in the eu. So you just,

657
00:37:42,525 --> 00:37:46,485
Speaker 2:  You just glossed past part of it though. Like the, the whole Apple suddenly

658
00:37:46,705 --> 00:37:50,685
Speaker 2:  allows emulators in the app store. Yeah. You say that as

659
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,605
Speaker 2:  If, you expected that to happen. I don't think anybody expected that to happen.

660
00:37:53,865 --> 00:37:57,405
Speaker 6:  Not at all It the most, yeah. Unexpected thing that could have happened.

661
00:37:57,505 --> 00:38:01,005
Speaker 6:  And me and Shane had different reactions at first. Shane was

662
00:38:01,355 --> 00:38:04,685
Speaker 6:  more like, what this changes everything now we gotta think through.

663
00:38:05,345 --> 00:38:09,045
Speaker 6:  And my just reaction was, wow, what validation

664
00:38:09,195 --> 00:38:12,925
Speaker 6:  that Apple had to change the rules to allow emulators because

665
00:38:12,955 --> 00:38:16,085
Speaker 6:  they were threatened by us about to launch with an emulator. Like that to

666
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:19,445
Speaker 6:  me was like invigorating. I was like, this is, yes, it means we're doing

667
00:38:19,445 --> 00:38:22,605
Speaker 6:  something right. That Apple is literally like doing something I never thought

668
00:38:22,605 --> 00:38:26,405
Speaker 6:  they'd do because it was the only way they could try to make the

669
00:38:26,405 --> 00:38:30,325
Speaker 6:  story. Not the EU now has the best apps outside the EU has, doesn't

670
00:38:30,325 --> 00:38:33,365
Speaker 6:  have the coolest apps and I just knew Apple like yeah they just couldn't

671
00:38:33,365 --> 00:38:36,805
Speaker 6:  have that story. Which is also why em are allowed worldwide is my guess is

672
00:38:36,945 --> 00:38:40,005
Speaker 6:  the story just could not have been the EU has better apps than the rest of

673
00:38:40,005 --> 00:38:40,245
Speaker 6:  the world.

674
00:38:40,675 --> 00:38:44,525
Speaker 2:  Yeah, no I, I think that's exactly right. And it is very hard to argue that

675
00:38:44,525 --> 00:38:48,365
Speaker 2:  this wasn't specifically about Delta. Like I just can't, the timing,

676
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:49,885
Speaker 2:  it's too, it

677
00:38:49,885 --> 00:38:53,645
Speaker 6:  Is all about Delta it because we haven't had a direct

678
00:38:53,645 --> 00:38:57,085
Speaker 6:  confirmation from Apple, but our app Delta was being notarized for like five

679
00:38:57,085 --> 00:39:00,925
Speaker 6:  weeks. They changed this rule, it's approved the next day. Oh wow.

680
00:39:00,925 --> 00:39:01,125
Speaker 2:  Like,

681
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:04,365
Speaker 6:  Oh wow. It's almost like they were holding it to figure out what they could

682
00:39:04,365 --> 00:39:04,925
Speaker 6:  do about it.

683
00:39:05,585 --> 00:39:07,965
Speaker 2:  Did you get any heads up that they were gonna make this change? Nope.

684
00:39:08,115 --> 00:39:08,965
Speaker 6:  Nothing at all.

685
00:39:09,835 --> 00:39:13,765
Speaker 2:  Well, and it, I would guess after that happened you would've

686
00:39:13,925 --> 00:39:17,285
Speaker 2:  expected it to be big. It sounds like you did expect it to be big, but I

687
00:39:17,285 --> 00:39:20,325
Speaker 2:  feel like it's been, it's certainly been bigger than I expected. Like

688
00:39:20,545 --> 00:39:22,125
Speaker 6:  It is bigger than I expected. I can,

689
00:39:22,195 --> 00:39:23,325
Speaker 2:  It's been nuts man.

690
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:27,725
Speaker 6:  It's so validating. Like I really can't like, because yeah, we're doing this

691
00:39:27,725 --> 00:39:31,685
Speaker 6:  because we just really believe that people just want to play old

692
00:39:31,685 --> 00:39:35,645
Speaker 6:  Nintendo games or old old games. We just, I think it's just a thing people

693
00:39:35,645 --> 00:39:39,525
Speaker 6:  wanna do and for so long everyone just says no, that's only for the

694
00:39:39,525 --> 00:39:42,645
Speaker 6:  nerds. It's only for like people who know what they're doing. And I've just

695
00:39:42,645 --> 00:39:46,285
Speaker 6:  been like, you just have to make it accessible. That's all it means. Like

696
00:39:46,285 --> 00:39:49,965
Speaker 6:  all you gotta do, if it's accessible, people will know how to do it and they

697
00:39:49,965 --> 00:39:52,725
Speaker 6:  will love it. We we're seeing that that is exactly the case and yes. So even

698
00:39:52,725 --> 00:39:56,285
Speaker 6:  more people than I thought are enjoying it. It is the most surreal thing

699
00:39:56,285 --> 00:40:00,165
Speaker 6:  seeing it not only in the app store but being the top app

700
00:40:00,225 --> 00:40:01,005
Speaker 6:  in the app store

701
00:40:01,385 --> 00:40:04,165
Speaker 2:  For like a long time. Are you still the number one app in the app store?

702
00:40:04,285 --> 00:40:06,805
Speaker 6:  I mean, I think last time I checked, but yeah, since we've launched we've

703
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:10,405
Speaker 6:  been number one and yeah, so surreal. Like

704
00:40:10,945 --> 00:40:14,565
Speaker 6:  the most, like anytime in my life I've never felt more like

705
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:18,045
Speaker 6:  I actually am dreaming right now. Like I need like pinching myself like,

706
00:40:18,645 --> 00:40:22,525
Speaker 6:  'cause it was just too perfect. Like work on this app for 10 years and then

707
00:40:22,945 --> 00:40:26,085
Speaker 6:  day one in the app store, it's the top. I was just incredible.

708
00:40:26,665 --> 00:40:30,525
Speaker 2:  Has it changed what you think about how to do all of this? I mean, If, you

709
00:40:30,525 --> 00:40:34,485
Speaker 2:  had charged 2 99 for Delta. You would've made a crap ton of money by

710
00:40:34,485 --> 00:40:37,645
Speaker 2:  now. Like have you, are, are you thinking about the business of all of this

711
00:40:37,645 --> 00:40:39,765
Speaker 2:  differently after it's blown up the way that it has?

712
00:40:40,645 --> 00:40:44,605
Speaker 6:  I think we want this to be bigger than just like Delta.

713
00:40:45,345 --> 00:40:49,325
Speaker 6:  And we want this to cause like actual change in

714
00:40:49,325 --> 00:40:53,245
Speaker 6:  like the emulation scene or in the gaming sphere. Just like we want to

715
00:40:53,245 --> 00:40:56,285
Speaker 6:  make this more accessible for everyone. We want people to start talking about

716
00:40:56,285 --> 00:40:59,085
Speaker 6:  it and to have real conversations about it without just being like, piracy.

717
00:40:59,145 --> 00:41:02,685
Speaker 6:  Piracy. And so a lot of what we're doing is we thought Delta

718
00:41:03,185 --> 00:41:06,645
Speaker 6:  to make that change happen, we had to like, it had to be free, had to be,

719
00:41:06,885 --> 00:41:09,525
Speaker 6:  everyone had to have it. And that's, I think just what we're focused on really

720
00:41:09,525 --> 00:41:11,925
Speaker 6:  is like, as long as we're, we're making, like we're making enough to support

721
00:41:11,925 --> 00:41:15,765
Speaker 6:  ourselves and so we're not in need of more money, but I just think for Delta

722
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:19,365
Speaker 6:  have the biggest impact. It's just make it as fully free and

723
00:41:19,365 --> 00:41:23,005
Speaker 6:  accessible to as many people as possible and let them just start reliving

724
00:41:23,005 --> 00:41:23,165
Speaker 6:  games.

725
00:41:23,705 --> 00:41:27,605
Speaker 2:  Are you worried at all about legal ramifications? I mean there was

726
00:41:27,605 --> 00:41:31,205
Speaker 2:  obviously the, the yuzu thing that happened kind of right before this. It's

727
00:41:31,205 --> 00:41:34,885
Speaker 2:  been a, it's been a weird moment in the emulation community. Have has, have

728
00:41:34,885 --> 00:41:36,285
Speaker 2:  you heard from any Nintendo lawyers?

729
00:41:36,835 --> 00:41:39,765
Speaker 6:  Yeah. That came out as we're also like in Europe trying to launch this. I'm

730
00:41:39,765 --> 00:41:43,445
Speaker 6:  like, oh, interesting. Very, very relevant to us. But

731
00:41:43,945 --> 00:41:47,925
Speaker 6:  I'm not gonna say I'm not nervous about things, but

732
00:41:48,085 --> 00:41:51,965
Speaker 6:  I am confident in what we're doing. I've learned a lot of what

733
00:41:51,985 --> 00:41:55,925
Speaker 6:  not to do over the past 10 years. And I think that we are really

734
00:41:55,925 --> 00:41:59,205
Speaker 6:  trying to show how you can do something like this legal. Like we're not yuzu,

735
00:41:59,205 --> 00:42:03,125
Speaker 6:  we're not emulating a current generation console. We're not doing

736
00:42:03,165 --> 00:42:05,445
Speaker 6:  a lot of things that other emulators get in trouble. Like we're, there's

737
00:42:05,445 --> 00:42:09,365
Speaker 6:  no DRM we have to deal with to like for the the game. So just the game files

738
00:42:09,365 --> 00:42:12,645
Speaker 6:  ripped from cartridges. So we don't have to do anything like that.

739
00:42:13,055 --> 00:42:16,285
Speaker 6:  We're doing everything we can to do it right. And there was no world that

740
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:18,285
Speaker 6:  I wouldn't have done this. I guess that is a better way. Like I wouldn't

741
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:21,485
Speaker 6:  have got this far and not released Delta. I just had to Yeah,

742
00:42:21,545 --> 00:42:24,485
Speaker 2:  No, I, I think that Well and I think that's part of why this moment of your

743
00:42:24,485 --> 00:42:27,645
Speaker 2:  story is so interesting because we're at the beginning of

744
00:42:28,635 --> 00:42:32,605
Speaker 2:  this weird new era of apps in the app store and

745
00:42:32,605 --> 00:42:35,285
Speaker 2:  I think a lot of stuff is changing and a lot is gonna continue to change.

746
00:42:35,545 --> 00:42:39,525
Speaker 2:  But we're also, in a funny way kind of at the end of your 10 year

747
00:42:39,525 --> 00:42:42,685
Speaker 2:  journey, like the this you, you finally finished the thing

748
00:42:43,155 --> 00:42:47,005
Speaker 6:  That, that is what it feels like. It's really weird, but I'm like, wow,

749
00:42:47,545 --> 00:42:51,365
Speaker 6:  it actually happened like it got in the app store and yes,

750
00:42:51,465 --> 00:42:55,165
Speaker 6:  it does feel like the culmination of that whole journey, which is very

751
00:42:55,175 --> 00:42:55,885
Speaker 6:  weird. Yeah.

752
00:42:56,195 --> 00:43:00,085
Speaker 2:  Does that make it feel like I finally got to do it and it worked

753
00:43:00,105 --> 00:43:02,765
Speaker 2:  and it was huge and it was awesome and now I can go do something else?

754
00:43:03,405 --> 00:43:06,845
Speaker 6:  I honestly, the, the fact that Delta's doing so well has just motivated me

755
00:43:06,845 --> 00:43:10,445
Speaker 6:  to just wanna work on it so much for right now because I've just been working

756
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:14,205
Speaker 6:  on it in isolation. Assuming one day it could like be a big deal

757
00:43:14,395 --> 00:43:18,205
Speaker 6:  That I don't know, actually seeing everyone play it right now has made me

758
00:43:18,205 --> 00:43:22,165
Speaker 6:  really motivated to like really focus on it again. And also because so much

759
00:43:22,165 --> 00:43:25,645
Speaker 6:  of the past two years has been like a lot priority working on alt store and

760
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:28,565
Speaker 6:  now that we launched alt store, we can just like have some fun with Delta

761
00:43:28,565 --> 00:43:31,325
Speaker 6:  again. Like there's just so many fun features I want to add that I haven't

762
00:43:31,325 --> 00:43:33,925
Speaker 6:  had time to, 'cause we had to get alt store up and running for this deadline,

763
00:43:34,265 --> 00:43:37,645
Speaker 6:  but, so I'm looking forward to a lot of that. But I don't know if this is

764
00:43:37,645 --> 00:43:40,165
Speaker 6:  a 10 year thing. I don't know if this is the beginning of like another 10

765
00:43:40,165 --> 00:43:44,125
Speaker 6:  year adventure To me, I think it's, I'll work on Delta for a bit and

766
00:43:44,485 --> 00:43:47,605
Speaker 6:  I think I gotta finish up what Alt store is like. We still have some to do

767
00:43:47,745 --> 00:43:51,325
Speaker 6:  to prove it out, like we gotta get the third party apps on there. We gotta

768
00:43:51,325 --> 00:43:55,245
Speaker 6:  build up the platform and I think that's, to me, the next step

769
00:43:55,345 --> 00:43:58,565
Speaker 6:  is just making sure that Alt Store is a real app store that people are using

770
00:43:58,585 --> 00:44:00,325
Speaker 6:  and happy with and then maybe I'll be done

771
00:44:01,585 --> 00:44:05,525
Speaker 2:  And then then you will have resoundingly defeated Apple, which very few

772
00:44:05,525 --> 00:44:06,245
Speaker 2:  people can say,

773
00:44:06,505 --> 00:44:07,445
Speaker 6:  That's what I want. Yeah.

774
00:44:08,825 --> 00:44:11,605
Speaker 2:  All right. We gotta take a break and then I have to tell you about this weird

775
00:44:11,635 --> 00:44:12,605
Speaker 2:  obsession I've

776
00:46:28,245 --> 00:46:32,165
Speaker 8:  a Prop G Pod special sponsored by Canva. You can find it on the Prop G

777
00:46:32,225 --> 00:46:34,125
Speaker 8:  pod wherever you get your podcasts.

778
00:46:40,855 --> 00:46:44,825
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. I've spent most of the last month and really most of

779
00:46:44,825 --> 00:46:48,745
Speaker 2:  the last year talking about and testing AI gadgets. It's been

780
00:46:48,745 --> 00:46:52,585
Speaker 2:  a long time, maybe since the early VR days, but maybe even as far

781
00:46:52,585 --> 00:46:56,385
Speaker 2:  back as the early smartphone era since we've seen this many new things with

782
00:46:56,415 --> 00:47:00,105
Speaker 2:  this many new ideas, most of those ideas right now

783
00:47:00,205 --> 00:47:03,905
Speaker 2:  are very bad. Well, not bad necessarily, it's just that they don't

784
00:47:04,055 --> 00:47:07,825
Speaker 2:  work so they're bad. You know what I mean? The Humane AI pin has

785
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:11,465
Speaker 2:  some interesting theories about how you might use a device without a screen

786
00:47:11,525 --> 00:47:14,385
Speaker 2:  and without getting sucked in and distracted. It's just that none of those

787
00:47:14,385 --> 00:47:18,065
Speaker 2:  things work very well. The Rabbit R one just kind of puts an AI

788
00:47:18,215 --> 00:47:21,785
Speaker 2:  chatbot on a device that looks like a rearranged phone, and again,

789
00:47:21,935 --> 00:47:25,545
Speaker 2:  none of it works very well so far. For me at least, there is only

790
00:47:25,845 --> 00:47:29,405
Speaker 2:  one thing about AI that really feels like it works and

791
00:47:29,845 --> 00:47:33,285
Speaker 2:  actually makes my life better, and that is voice notes, a good microphone

792
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:36,885
Speaker 2:  plus good transcription software plus some useful models for

793
00:47:37,125 --> 00:47:40,485
Speaker 2:  summarizing and grabbing the most important bits of what I say. It works

794
00:47:40,825 --> 00:47:44,045
Speaker 2:  and it's awesome. I kind of feel like a doctor now running around talking

795
00:47:44,405 --> 00:47:48,085
Speaker 2:  nonsense into my tape recorder like JD from season four of Scrubs,

796
00:47:48,505 --> 00:47:51,685
Speaker 9:  Mrs. Mcal forties, moderately attractive, conditioned, improving.

797
00:47:52,465 --> 00:47:54,485
Speaker 10:  Did you just say I was moderately attractive?

798
00:47:54,865 --> 00:47:56,045
Speaker 9:  Excuse me, Mrs. Mcal

799
00:47:56,555 --> 00:47:59,285
Speaker 11:  Patient's complaint of hearing loss was clearly just to get attention

800
00:48:00,025 --> 00:48:03,525
Speaker 2:  Though I also, to be fair, have this experience a lot doing that.

801
00:48:04,045 --> 00:48:04,165
Speaker 2:  I

802
00:48:04,165 --> 00:48:07,285
Speaker 12:  Thought, I like toast. They aren't all

803
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:11,125
Speaker 2:  Winners In actual reality, by the way, doctors have used voice recorders

804
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:14,925
Speaker 2:  forever. Talking is a lot faster than typing, and a transcript

805
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:18,765
Speaker 2:  of a conversation can often give you a lot more information quickly

806
00:48:18,865 --> 00:48:22,645
Speaker 2:  and with context than you'd get from just a written thing, and a lot of

807
00:48:22,645 --> 00:48:26,325
Speaker 2:  doctors are now using AI to help summarize those transcripts and help them

808
00:48:26,325 --> 00:48:30,005
Speaker 2:  find key information later because the problem with recording everything

809
00:48:30,005 --> 00:48:33,565
Speaker 2:  on a voice recorder is that it's a lot of information and it takes a lot

810
00:48:33,565 --> 00:48:37,085
Speaker 2:  of time to parse through it all, listening to your own voice for hours at

811
00:48:37,085 --> 00:48:40,485
Speaker 2:  a time just to find that one thing you said, not fun. The big thing that

812
00:48:40,765 --> 00:48:44,645
Speaker 2:  happened to make all of this stuff work recently is that OpenAI built

813
00:48:44,765 --> 00:48:48,365
Speaker 2:  a speech to text tool called Whisper. When OpenAI launched it in

814
00:48:48,365 --> 00:48:51,685
Speaker 2:  2022, it said that the model approaches human level

815
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:55,565
Speaker 2:  robustness and accuracy on English speech recognition in its blog

816
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:58,965
Speaker 2:  post announcing it. It used this audio as an example. This is

817
00:48:58,965 --> 00:49:01,085
Speaker 13:  The micro machine man presenting the most midget miniature motorcade of

818
00:49:01,085 --> 00:49:02,765
Speaker 13:  micro machine speech. One has dramatic details.

819
00:49:03,425 --> 00:49:07,325
Speaker 2:  That's a guy named John Mota, Jr doing a commercial, by the way. He's actually

820
00:49:07,325 --> 00:49:11,005
Speaker 2:  in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's fastest talker. I've

821
00:49:11,005 --> 00:49:14,805
Speaker 2:  now listened to that ad approximately a million times, and I do think Whisper

822
00:49:14,915 --> 00:49:18,685
Speaker 2:  gets one word wrong. It says R near the end, and I

823
00:49:18,685 --> 00:49:22,445
Speaker 2:  think Mota says and but I can't even tell for sure

824
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:26,245
Speaker 2:  and that's all Whisper missed. That's how good this is. OpenAI

825
00:49:26,605 --> 00:49:30,165
Speaker 2:  reportedly developed Whisper as a way to transcribe millions of hours of

826
00:49:30,165 --> 00:49:34,125
Speaker 2:  YouTube videos in order to get training data for its GPT models, which

827
00:49:34,125 --> 00:49:37,685
Speaker 2:  is a strange and somewhat nefarious way to have gotten to this point, but

828
00:49:37,685 --> 00:49:41,485
Speaker 2:  let's just leave that aside now. We have this open source whisper model that

829
00:49:41,485 --> 00:49:45,405
Speaker 2:  works incredibly well and is being used all over the voice notes world.

830
00:49:45,825 --> 00:49:49,245
Speaker 2:  The first gadget I got to try all this out is called the pla note.

831
00:49:49,525 --> 00:49:53,485
Speaker 2:  P-L-A-U-D. It's a $160 recorder about the size of a credit

832
00:49:53,485 --> 00:49:56,765
Speaker 2:  card, just a little thicker and a little heavier. It's just a microphone

833
00:49:56,765 --> 00:50:00,485
Speaker 2:  basically that connects to an app on your phone to store and process all

834
00:50:00,485 --> 00:50:04,125
Speaker 2:  of your recordings. You just press the one button on the plot to start recording

835
00:50:04,185 --> 00:50:07,365
Speaker 2:  and a little red light turns on to let you know it's working. It has one

836
00:50:07,365 --> 00:50:11,285
Speaker 2:  mode for just recording your voice and another that's supposedly optimized

837
00:50:11,285 --> 00:50:14,405
Speaker 2:  for recording phone calls. It actually comes with a case you can attach to

838
00:50:14,405 --> 00:50:17,805
Speaker 2:  the back of your phone for recording those calls and it's surprisingly good

839
00:50:17,805 --> 00:50:18,085
Speaker 2:  at it.

840
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:22,365
Speaker 14:  Authority note that this call may be recorded for quality assurance

841
00:50:23,065 --> 00:50:26,445
Speaker 14:  If, you have an emergency, please press one now. If, you would like to fill

842
00:50:26,485 --> 00:50:27,845
Speaker 14:  a prescription. Press two.

843
00:50:28,505 --> 00:50:32,365
Speaker 2:  As a reporter who has spent most of my career constantly trying to find

844
00:50:32,365 --> 00:50:36,245
Speaker 2:  ways to record phone calls, this is awesome. For years, I've used this

845
00:50:36,245 --> 00:50:39,525
Speaker 2:  weird rig where I have a headphone splitter that goes into a pair of ear

846
00:50:39,595 --> 00:50:43,445
Speaker 2:  pods and also into a voice recorder. This is just way better, but you

847
00:50:43,445 --> 00:50:46,885
Speaker 2:  can also use it to record sales calls and meetings and that sort of thing.

848
00:50:47,185 --> 00:50:51,125
Speaker 2:  Claude definitely imagines the note as a business tool. First and foremost,

849
00:50:51,725 --> 00:50:54,965
Speaker 2:  I have been using it mostly for things like to-do lists or when I wake up

850
00:50:54,965 --> 00:50:57,605
Speaker 2:  in the middle of the night with a fun idea and want to get it down before

851
00:50:57,645 --> 00:51:01,445
Speaker 2:  I forget and I love, love using it while I wander

852
00:51:01,445 --> 00:51:04,325
Speaker 2:  around my kitchen to see what needs to go on the grocery list.

853
00:51:04,715 --> 00:51:08,485
Speaker 15:  Okay, this is my grocery list for the week of May. First

854
00:51:09,565 --> 00:51:12,125
Speaker 15:  I need bagels, potatoes,

855
00:51:13,265 --> 00:51:16,765
Speaker 2:  Almost outta bread flour, so I should get bread flour. I need more

856
00:51:17,315 --> 00:51:20,205
Speaker 15:  Paprika, but the smoked paprika, not the other stuff.

857
00:51:21,105 --> 00:51:24,805
Speaker 2:  So I record that and then a few seconds later I open up the plot app, which

858
00:51:24,805 --> 00:51:28,285
Speaker 2:  is very bare bones, but works basically fine, and that recording shows up.

859
00:51:28,565 --> 00:51:32,045
Speaker 2:  I open it up and I get three options, transcription summary and mind map.

860
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:35,645
Speaker 2:  Mind map is useless. Let's not worry about mind map. I tap on transcription

861
00:51:35,825 --> 00:51:39,085
Speaker 2:  and it asks what language the recording is in and what kind of note it is,

862
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:43,365
Speaker 2:  call meeting, interview, task assignment, that kind of thing. I pick task

863
00:51:43,365 --> 00:51:47,205
Speaker 2:  assignment in English and a few minutes later I get a full and very accurate

864
00:51:47,205 --> 00:51:51,005
Speaker 2:  transcription of my grocery list. That's kind of useful, but

865
00:51:51,005 --> 00:51:54,965
Speaker 2:  really what I want is for this to just make me a grocery list, so I tap

866
00:51:54,965 --> 00:51:58,925
Speaker 2:  on summary. It tells me at the top, the meeting outlined the necessary grocery

867
00:51:58,935 --> 00:52:02,285
Speaker 2:  items to be purchased for the upcoming week, ensuring a sufficient supply

868
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:05,645
Speaker 2:  of food and essentials, which is true, I suppose, but totally

869
00:52:05,645 --> 00:52:09,325
Speaker 2:  unnecessary, and then it gives me the list. All is a single

870
00:52:09,385 --> 00:52:13,245
Speaker 2:  action item. This is not what I was hoping for, but all the stuff is

871
00:52:13,245 --> 00:52:16,685
Speaker 2:  here and the coolest part is when I said I was good on peanut butter and

872
00:52:16,685 --> 00:52:20,485
Speaker 2:  good on coffee, it actually kept those things off of the list,

873
00:52:20,895 --> 00:52:24,805
Speaker 2:  which means it actually in some way understood the difference between me

874
00:52:24,805 --> 00:52:28,045
Speaker 2:  saying something and me deliberately adding it to the list.

875
00:52:28,585 --> 00:52:32,405
Speaker 2:  That's the stuff, right? The plot note is very cool, but

876
00:52:32,435 --> 00:52:36,405
Speaker 2:  it's expensive for just a voice recorder, and you do also have to pay 80

877
00:52:36,405 --> 00:52:40,125
Speaker 2:  bucks a year for the AI features. That is a lot for a grocery

878
00:52:40,155 --> 00:52:43,925
Speaker 2:  list tool, so instead I turned to the Rabbit R one, a more

879
00:52:43,925 --> 00:52:47,845
Speaker 2:  full featured AI device. That in general is pretty bad. It can't

880
00:52:47,845 --> 00:52:51,445
Speaker 2:  do a lot of what it promises, but it can record, transcribe and summarize

881
00:52:51,455 --> 00:52:54,885
Speaker 2:  audio, so I started carrying this thing around just to see how it would do

882
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:58,165
Speaker 2:  with to-do lists and journal entries and all that stuff as well.

883
00:52:58,755 --> 00:53:02,725
Speaker 15:  This is me testing out the voice recorder. Let's see what

884
00:53:02,845 --> 00:53:05,965
Speaker 15:  I have to do today. I need to finish

885
00:53:06,625 --> 00:53:10,605
Speaker 15:  my Apple story. I sent edit back to Jake. He's gonna get it spec to

886
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:14,285
Speaker 15:  me. I'd like to get that at least into top edit. Today we have The

887
00:53:14,365 --> 00:53:15,165
Speaker 15:  Vergecast it to

888
00:53:15,915 --> 00:53:19,125
Speaker 2:  Once you record something, rabbit stores it all in an app called The Rabbit

889
00:53:19,155 --> 00:53:22,645
Speaker 2:  Hole, which is not a good app in general, but for these purposes it's fine.

890
00:53:23,025 --> 00:53:26,965
Speaker 2:  It pulled out a very basic plain text list of stuff from my note

891
00:53:27,025 --> 00:53:30,965
Speaker 2:  in addition to just giving me access to the recording itself and it got most

892
00:53:30,985 --> 00:53:34,605
Speaker 2:  of the stuff on that to-do list that I said, but it did just completely ignore

893
00:53:34,765 --> 00:53:38,405
Speaker 2:  a couple of things and since Rabbit doesn't just make a transcript and let

894
00:53:38,405 --> 00:53:41,525
Speaker 2:  you see it, I don't actually like this one quite as much. At least it is

895
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:45,045
Speaker 2:  easy to download the audio and upload it somewhere else, which is something,

896
00:53:45,065 --> 00:53:48,565
Speaker 2:  and the mic is pretty good. I need to write the container post for tomorrow,

897
00:53:48,585 --> 00:53:52,525
Speaker 2:  but I can do that tonight while Anna is at class. That's my day, but in general,

898
00:53:52,825 --> 00:53:56,725
Speaker 2:  buying a whole device just to record audio is probably

899
00:53:56,795 --> 00:54:00,725
Speaker 2:  only for the most dedicated users of this stuff. The main advantage

900
00:54:00,785 --> 00:54:04,565
Speaker 2:  of a dedicated voice recorder is that the battery tends to last a lot longer.

901
00:54:04,635 --> 00:54:08,285
Speaker 2:  They tend to have better mics and also because they're not an app, you don't

902
00:54:08,285 --> 00:54:12,085
Speaker 2:  run the risk of weirdness with background apps shutting down or getting

903
00:54:12,205 --> 00:54:16,005
Speaker 2:  a phone call in the middle that screws everything up or just loud pinging

904
00:54:16,005 --> 00:54:19,445
Speaker 2:  notifications constantly popping up in your recording. Not everyone needs

905
00:54:19,645 --> 00:54:23,565
Speaker 2:  a voice recorder all the time, but If you do. You'll probably appreciate

906
00:54:23,565 --> 00:54:27,245
Speaker 2:  it being a dedicated device, but If, you want to get most of the

907
00:54:27,445 --> 00:54:30,605
Speaker 2:  functionality of those devices, but you'd rather just use your phone. Oh

908
00:54:30,745 --> 00:54:34,285
Speaker 2:  boy, do I have good news for you? There are suddenly a million apps out there

909
00:54:34,285 --> 00:54:37,805
Speaker 2:  that are making use of Whisper and other models, especially from OpenAI

910
00:54:38,065 --> 00:54:41,565
Speaker 2:  to transcribe, summarize and make use of all of your audio.

911
00:54:42,025 --> 00:54:44,885
Speaker 2:  You can basically Google and find a thousand options, but let me just tell

912
00:54:44,885 --> 00:54:48,605
Speaker 2:  you about two. The first is called Cleft Notes and it works on Mac and

913
00:54:48,945 --> 00:54:52,525
Speaker 2:  iOS. This one I think is the best Voice Notes app I've tried period.

914
00:54:52,865 --> 00:54:56,525
Speaker 2:  You open it up and hit record and it shows this a morphous meshy

915
00:54:56,925 --> 00:55:00,725
Speaker 2:  blob that moves as you record, which is kind of delightful to look at. Like

916
00:55:00,725 --> 00:55:04,245
Speaker 2:  most other apps. It gives you both a full transcription of your audio and

917
00:55:04,245 --> 00:55:07,925
Speaker 2:  tries to make some sense of it after you finished, but cleft goes further

918
00:55:08,445 --> 00:55:11,365
Speaker 2:  actually, it tries to format and structure everything you said so that If,

919
00:55:11,365 --> 00:55:14,885
Speaker 2:  you come out of a call and you wanna write down some takeaways. Okay, I just

920
00:55:14,885 --> 00:55:18,685
Speaker 2:  got off the call where we were planning Steve's bachelor party. It sounds

921
00:55:18,685 --> 00:55:22,405
Speaker 2:  like the plan is to go to Myrtle Beach for

922
00:55:22,405 --> 00:55:25,885
Speaker 2:  three days. It then turns that into a document with bullet points and numbers

923
00:55:25,985 --> 00:55:29,485
Speaker 2:  and headings. It's not always right, but it's usually actually a pretty good

924
00:55:29,485 --> 00:55:33,285
Speaker 2:  start. Like that voice note I just played turned into a cleft note with

925
00:55:33,345 --> 00:55:37,205
Speaker 2:  an itinerary, golf plans, a transportation section, a food and drinks

926
00:55:37,205 --> 00:55:41,005
Speaker 2:  section, and a note about renting golf clubs. It's written strangely,

927
00:55:41,445 --> 00:55:45,285
Speaker 2:  formally, but it is really helpful. There are, like I said, tons of

928
00:55:45,285 --> 00:55:48,845
Speaker 2:  apps that do this and since they basically all use open AI's models,

929
00:55:48,915 --> 00:55:52,685
Speaker 2:  they're all roughly equivalent in terms of the actual quality of the

930
00:55:52,925 --> 00:55:56,445
Speaker 2:  transcript and information. But I just wanna quickly mention one other app

931
00:55:56,525 --> 00:56:00,165
Speaker 2:  I really like. It's called Audio Pen and it's a web app, which means it works

932
00:56:00,165 --> 00:56:04,125
Speaker 2:  everywhere and it's super easy and fast. You just record some audio.

933
00:56:04,785 --> 00:56:08,205
Speaker 2:  My grocery list for today, I need eggs, I need nut butter.

934
00:56:08,585 --> 00:56:12,485
Speaker 2:  I'm good on coffee and good on tea. I need red wine for this

935
00:56:12,485 --> 00:56:16,085
Speaker 2:  weekend. I need coffee filters. I need three balls of

936
00:56:16,205 --> 00:56:19,245
Speaker 2:  mozzarella for pizza. Once you do it gives you the same summaries and information

937
00:56:19,305 --> 00:56:22,925
Speaker 2:  as the rest, but what I really like about Audio Pen in particular is that

938
00:56:22,925 --> 00:56:26,765
Speaker 2:  If, you pay the $99 a year for audio pen prime, which gets you more

939
00:56:26,765 --> 00:56:30,405
Speaker 2:  transcriptions and storage and whatnot. You can also tell it how to format

940
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:34,525
Speaker 2:  what it creates. So If, you want everything in bullets or paragraphs or

941
00:56:34,525 --> 00:56:38,285
Speaker 2:  like iambic pentameter. You can do that. Here for instance

942
00:56:38,385 --> 00:56:42,285
Speaker 2:  is my grocery list in iambic pentameter, which I had a different AI from

943
00:56:42,285 --> 00:56:43,645
Speaker 2:  11 labs. Read out loud

944
00:56:44,195 --> 00:56:48,165
Speaker 16:  Eggs and nut butter I require on coffee, tea, I'm

945
00:56:48,445 --> 00:56:52,365
Speaker 16:  satisfied. Red wine for weekend filters, two, three

946
00:56:52,645 --> 00:56:56,445
Speaker 16:  mozzarella balls will do pepperoni for pizza's taste more bread,

947
00:56:56,535 --> 00:57:00,485
Speaker 16:  flour not to waste broccoli mandarin's combine

948
00:57:00,905 --> 00:57:03,445
Speaker 16:  and peaches sweet, these fruits divine.

949
00:57:04,145 --> 00:57:07,485
Speaker 2:  You probably don't want your groceries in iambic pentameter. More likely

950
00:57:07,485 --> 00:57:11,325
Speaker 2:  you'll want to tell it to be formal for business stuff or write like an author

951
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:15,245
Speaker 2:  you like or something, but it works pretty well, whatever you pick,

952
00:57:15,385 --> 00:57:19,205
Speaker 2:  and it even goes another step toward turning my rambling thoughts

953
00:57:19,275 --> 00:57:23,085
Speaker 2:  into something that feels finished and useful and not just like

954
00:57:23,405 --> 00:57:27,045
Speaker 2:  rambling thoughts. Another thing you can do in audio pen is upload existing

955
00:57:27,045 --> 00:57:30,885
Speaker 2:  audio, so like If, you have a meeting you already recorded and now need to

956
00:57:30,885 --> 00:57:34,725
Speaker 2:  get something from, or you want notes on a YouTube video you liked, you can

957
00:57:34,725 --> 00:57:38,485
Speaker 2:  just dump the audio in and get info out. I've heard a lot of people

958
00:57:38,585 --> 00:57:42,525
Speaker 2:  say recently that summarizing YouTube videos is one of their core uses

959
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:46,365
Speaker 2:  for chat GPT and other AI models, and this is another way to get the

960
00:57:46,365 --> 00:57:50,005
Speaker 2:  same kind of thing you could put this podcast in and it would probably give

961
00:57:50,005 --> 00:57:53,805
Speaker 2:  you some information. Basically, all of these tools do cost money, If, you

962
00:57:53,805 --> 00:57:57,485
Speaker 2:  wanna do stuff like that, at least If, you wanna use them heavily. Whisper

963
00:57:57,785 --> 00:58:01,045
Speaker 2:  is an open source model that anyone can use. You can actually download it

964
00:58:01,045 --> 00:58:04,405
Speaker 2:  to your computer and run it locally. If you want to, but it is really

965
00:58:04,405 --> 00:58:08,325
Speaker 2:  computationally intensive and for all the summarization stuff, these apps

966
00:58:08,415 --> 00:58:12,165
Speaker 2:  still are mostly using open AI APIs anyway, oh,

967
00:58:12,305 --> 00:58:15,885
Speaker 2:  one exception I should mention actually, If, you have a Google Pixel phone.

968
00:58:15,945 --> 00:58:19,725
Speaker 2:  The built-in pixel recorder is a terrific voice recorder and

969
00:58:19,725 --> 00:58:23,405
Speaker 2:  there's a new summarize button in there that also works really well. Apple's

970
00:58:23,405 --> 00:58:26,725
Speaker 2:  voice memos app doesn't do any of the transcription or summarization stuff,

971
00:58:26,985 --> 00:58:30,045
Speaker 2:  but I wouldn't be shocked if that's coming soon. In the last few months I've

972
00:58:30,045 --> 00:58:33,805
Speaker 2:  been using AI audio for lots of things, meeting notes to-do

973
00:58:33,805 --> 00:58:37,085
Speaker 2:  lists, searchable transcripts of YouTube videos that I wanna refer back to,

974
00:58:37,385 --> 00:58:40,485
Speaker 2:  but I actually like it best as a journal. I've never been good at keeping

975
00:58:40,605 --> 00:58:43,885
Speaker 2:  a journal over the years because it always involves taking the time and sitting

976
00:58:43,885 --> 00:58:47,765
Speaker 2:  down to do it and it's an activity and it's a whole thing, but now I can

977
00:58:47,765 --> 00:58:51,405
Speaker 2:  just sit down in the morning and quickly brain dump everything

978
00:58:51,585 --> 00:58:55,245
Speaker 2:  I'm thinking about while I brush my teeth. Today is Wednesday May 1st.

979
00:58:55,945 --> 00:58:59,525
Speaker 2:  The first thing I have to do is finish up the

980
00:58:59,775 --> 00:59:03,765
Speaker 2:  Apple story and my rabbit review. I also have to

981
00:59:03,765 --> 00:59:07,685
Speaker 2:  book train tickets to get to New York for tomorrow, should

982
00:59:07,685 --> 00:59:11,005
Speaker 2:  be a relatively chill day, and then at the end of the day, while I'm doing

983
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:14,885
Speaker 2:  dishes or getting ready for bed or just walking around, I can just ramble

984
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:18,845
Speaker 2:  about what happened that day for a few minutes. I was in Chicago today for

985
00:59:18,845 --> 00:59:22,605
Speaker 2:  the Chicago Humanities Festival. It was a really fun day. We did

986
00:59:22,805 --> 00:59:26,565
Speaker 2:  a good job of I think not having the whole thing be a bummer, but

987
00:59:26,635 --> 00:59:30,365
Speaker 2:  also having it not be too sort of Pollyanna-ish

988
00:59:30,495 --> 00:59:34,285
Speaker 2:  optimistic. When I do that, I now get instead of just an audio

989
00:59:34,395 --> 00:59:38,325
Speaker 2:  file, a really good transcript that I can find again later and a

990
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:41,925
Speaker 2:  nice summary of the key points of everything I talk about. It's both incredibly

991
00:59:42,225 --> 00:59:46,125
Speaker 2:  low effort and surprisingly useful. Honestly, I hope

992
00:59:46,225 --> 00:59:48,885
Speaker 2:  Day one, which is the journaling app I've been trying to force myself to

993
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:52,845
Speaker 2:  use for like a decade now adopts some of this stuff. This feels like a

994
00:59:52,845 --> 00:59:56,645
Speaker 2:  good way to get things into a journal. Honestly, I think these

995
00:59:56,715 --> 01:00:00,565
Speaker 2:  apps and devices are kind of perfectly indicative of how AI works

996
01:00:00,565 --> 01:00:04,125
Speaker 2:  right now in general for all the hype over image generation and

997
01:00:04,395 --> 01:00:08,205
Speaker 2:  AI's abilities to write emails for you or you know, replace your job entirely.

998
01:00:08,585 --> 01:00:12,365
Speaker 2:  The thing these models do best is take a bunch of information and try to

999
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:15,925
Speaker 2:  simplify and summarize it. That's handy If. You're trying to get the gist

1000
01:00:15,925 --> 01:00:19,565
Speaker 2:  of a long legal document or you wanna know what a podcast was about before

1001
01:00:19,565 --> 01:00:22,445
Speaker 2:  you devote 90 minutes of your life to it. That's why I'm so intrigued by

1002
01:00:22,445 --> 01:00:26,325
Speaker 2:  Notion AI and all the other tools that aren't trying to understand all of

1003
01:00:26,325 --> 01:00:29,645
Speaker 2:  the universe's information. They're just focused on the stuff that you care

1004
01:00:29,645 --> 01:00:33,565
Speaker 2:  about and making sense of that. That is a really good use case of AI

1005
01:00:33,585 --> 01:00:37,525
Speaker 2:  If. you ask me and it's working pretty well for me because as you guessed,

1006
01:00:38,005 --> 01:00:41,365
Speaker 2:  I do love rambling into microphones. Actually, you know what? I should stop

1007
01:00:41,365 --> 01:00:43,885
Speaker 2:  doing that for a minute. We're gonna take a quick break and then we're gonna

1008
01:00:43,885 --> 01:00:46,485
Speaker 2:  come back and take a question for the Birch Cast hotline. We'll be right

1009
01:00:46,485 --> 01:00:46,645
Speaker 2:  back.

1010
01:01:33,135 --> 01:01:35,535
Speaker 19:  peanut butter and chocolate. However,

1011
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:53,025
Speaker 2:  back. Let's get to the hotline as always. The number is 8 6 6 VERGE one one

1012
01:02:53,125 --> 01:02:53,345
Speaker 2:  and

1013
01:03:52,305 --> 01:03:56,185
Speaker 2:  non-cynical answer. The non-cynical answer is that I think there

1014
01:03:56,245 --> 01:04:00,025
Speaker 2:  is room for something that isn't a smartphone. In a funny

1015
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:03,185
Speaker 2:  way, we're actually going through the beginnings of an

1016
01:04:03,435 --> 01:04:07,385
Speaker 2:  unbundling process in a lot of ways. I think there is a set

1017
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:11,145
Speaker 2:  of people who are realizing that they want multiple devices

1018
01:04:11,285 --> 01:04:14,425
Speaker 2:  for multiple things. The idea that I should just have a smartphone that does

1019
01:04:14,425 --> 01:04:18,185
Speaker 2:  everything was never really true. I mean, think about that brief

1020
01:04:18,185 --> 01:04:21,985
Speaker 2:  moment where we tried to use our smartphones as TV remotes.

1021
01:04:22,045 --> 01:04:25,465
Speaker 2:  It turns out that having buttons you can press without having to look down

1022
01:04:25,485 --> 01:04:29,345
Speaker 2:  at is a good idea. Something like the RayBan

1023
01:04:29,555 --> 01:04:32,545
Speaker 2:  Metas Smartt glasses I think is really interesting or the snap spectacles

1024
01:04:32,545 --> 01:04:35,865
Speaker 2:  that they've been working on for years. The idea that actually a camera

1025
01:04:36,165 --> 01:04:39,985
Speaker 2:  that's not in my pocket but is on my face is

1026
01:04:40,225 --> 01:04:43,825
Speaker 2:  actually a good idea. So I think there are some things that should have been

1027
01:04:44,245 --> 01:04:47,985
Speaker 2:  shoved into the phone, right? Like my phone as a music player and not

1028
01:04:47,985 --> 01:04:51,825
Speaker 2:  necessarily needing a dedicated music player makes a lot of sense, but

1029
01:04:51,865 --> 01:04:55,665
Speaker 2:  I think there is room for some kind of AI device that

1030
01:04:55,755 --> 01:04:59,105
Speaker 2:  isn't your phone. The idea that it could be a little more accessible, it

1031
01:04:59,105 --> 01:05:02,745
Speaker 2:  could be closer to your face and mouth and eyes and the sort of

1032
01:05:03,265 --> 01:05:06,865
Speaker 2:  biometric stuff that actually can make AI really useful. My guess is

1033
01:05:06,885 --> 01:05:10,505
Speaker 2:  that's probably something that looks more like a smartwatch or a pair of

1034
01:05:10,505 --> 01:05:14,425
Speaker 2:  glasses than it is a sort of dedicated handheld device. But the reason

1035
01:05:14,505 --> 01:05:17,540
Speaker 2:  I was so intrigued by Humane is I think the idea of a wearable that's like

1036
01:05:17,545 --> 01:05:21,365
Speaker 2:  on your lapel kind of always within arm's reach is

1037
01:05:21,365 --> 01:05:25,045
Speaker 2:  really interesting. That's also how I felt years ago about things like

1038
01:05:25,495 --> 01:05:29,125
Speaker 2:  Alexa and Google Assistant and the idea that, you know, I can talk to

1039
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:32,605
Speaker 2:  technology without having to pull my phone out, look at a screen, unlock

1040
01:05:32,685 --> 01:05:36,085
Speaker 2:  a thing. This idea of ambient computing that's been floating around actually

1041
01:05:36,085 --> 01:05:40,045
Speaker 2:  requires lots of different kinds of devices. I think the smartphone is going

1042
01:05:40,045 --> 01:05:43,805
Speaker 2:  to keep being the main one for a long time, and I think any product

1043
01:05:43,875 --> 01:05:47,725
Speaker 2:  that tries to subvert that and say ditch your phone and use this other

1044
01:05:47,725 --> 01:05:50,685
Speaker 2:  device is just gonna fail because A, people don't wanna ditch their phone

1045
01:05:50,685 --> 01:05:53,485
Speaker 2:  and B, you shouldn't. Phones are great and they're useful and they do lots

1046
01:05:53,485 --> 01:05:57,285
Speaker 2:  of things, but we can attach stuff to phones that does more things in

1047
01:05:57,285 --> 01:06:01,045
Speaker 2:  more ways and I think that's gonna be very cool. The AI

1048
01:06:01,185 --> 01:06:04,845
Speaker 2:  gadget remains to be seen, but there are ways it could work and there are

1049
01:06:04,845 --> 01:06:08,005
Speaker 2:  ways it could happen and there are ways that it might be exciting. That's

1050
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:11,165
Speaker 2:  the non-cynical answer is I think there is something here. The cynical answer

1051
01:06:11,665 --> 01:06:15,645
Speaker 2:  is that they're just desperately trying to find a

1052
01:06:15,645 --> 01:06:19,485
Speaker 2:  way to sell you something. We have gotten into a place in the

1053
01:06:19,485 --> 01:06:22,965
Speaker 2:  smartphone market where there are two companies, apple and Google, that are

1054
01:06:23,055 --> 01:06:26,725
Speaker 2:  total gatekeepers for the entire industry, right? If, you want to do something

1055
01:06:26,725 --> 01:06:29,925
Speaker 2:  in the iPhone, you have to play nice in the App Store, you have to play by

1056
01:06:29,925 --> 01:06:33,125
Speaker 2:  Apple's rules, you have to give Apple a cut. That is just how it works.

1057
01:06:33,635 --> 01:06:36,885
Speaker 2:  Same in the Play Store. There's like a little more openness in Android, but

1058
01:06:36,985 --> 01:06:40,165
Speaker 2:  for all intents and purposes, If, you wanna be on Android, you have to play

1059
01:06:40,165 --> 01:06:43,005
Speaker 2:  by Google's rules. That means there are certain kinds of things you just

1060
01:06:43,015 --> 01:06:46,965
Speaker 2:  can't do. That means there are certain kinds of apps that

1061
01:06:46,965 --> 01:06:50,325
Speaker 2:  you can't make a real business out of because of the way that Apple's rules

1062
01:06:50,325 --> 01:06:54,245
Speaker 2:  work. And so what you're left with is saying, okay, there are two companies

1063
01:06:54,475 --> 01:06:58,325
Speaker 2:  that are just going to tax us every time we want to do anything,

1064
01:06:58,825 --> 01:07:02,485
Speaker 2:  and I think we've kind of spent a decade watching

1065
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:06,765
Speaker 2:  companies that didn't win in mobile, try to win in the next

1066
01:07:06,765 --> 01:07:10,205
Speaker 2:  thing, and I think in a huge way that was why

1067
01:07:10,675 --> 01:07:14,525
Speaker 2:  then Facebook now Meta bought Oculus all those years ago because

1068
01:07:14,525 --> 01:07:18,165
Speaker 2:  it was saying, okay, we think that there is going to be a huge

1069
01:07:18,585 --> 01:07:22,485
Speaker 2:  new VR platform and we cannot lose it again to

1070
01:07:22,485 --> 01:07:26,325
Speaker 2:  Apple or Google because there's so much money in being Apple and Google.

1071
01:07:26,385 --> 01:07:28,965
Speaker 2:  You get to do all kinds of things, you get to insert yourself in the middle,

1072
01:07:28,965 --> 01:07:31,885
Speaker 2:  you get to take the tax, you get to become a huge ad business, you set the

1073
01:07:31,885 --> 01:07:35,845
Speaker 2:  defaults. It's just a massively powerful thing to be, and so when there

1074
01:07:35,845 --> 01:07:39,165
Speaker 2:  was the idea that, okay, VR is the next thing, you saw a bunch of companies

1075
01:07:39,165 --> 01:07:43,005
Speaker 2:  chase VR when everybody thought AR was gonna become the thing that was where

1076
01:07:43,195 --> 01:07:45,925
Speaker 2:  Snap showed up and was like, we're a camera company and we're gonna build

1077
01:07:45,925 --> 01:07:49,645
Speaker 2:  spectacles and we're gonna take over and you know the HoloLens did it and

1078
01:07:49,645 --> 01:07:53,605
Speaker 2:  Magic Leap did it and there was this crazy rush to not just be the

1079
01:07:53,605 --> 01:07:56,845
Speaker 2:  first great device but be the first great platform. The same thing is happening

1080
01:07:56,845 --> 01:08:00,645
Speaker 2:  right now in ai. As I talked to both Humane and Rabbit and

1081
01:08:00,645 --> 01:08:04,445
Speaker 2:  frankly a lot of other companies in this space, the idea is to start with

1082
01:08:04,645 --> 01:08:07,405
Speaker 2:  hardware, right? You build a product, you make people buy the product, you

1083
01:08:07,405 --> 01:08:10,605
Speaker 2:  make people like the product and then you build a platform out of it. Humane's

1084
01:08:10,605 --> 01:08:14,325
Speaker 2:  big idea is this thing called Cosmos. That's their operating system. They're

1085
01:08:14,325 --> 01:08:18,165
Speaker 2:  hoping basically to have an app store for Cosmos. You'll be able to use

1086
01:08:18,165 --> 01:08:21,245
Speaker 2:  the APIs to plug in, it'll work on lots of different devices like they are

1087
01:08:21,245 --> 01:08:25,165
Speaker 2:  very much trying to build a software platform with

1088
01:08:25,265 --> 01:08:29,045
Speaker 2:  the size and power of iOS or Android Rabbit has been a little

1089
01:08:29,675 --> 01:08:33,445
Speaker 2:  less ambitious about how it talks about that, but when it talks about

1090
01:08:33,465 --> 01:08:36,685
Speaker 2:  the large action model, this thing that can actually go and use the apps

1091
01:08:36,905 --> 01:08:40,845
Speaker 2:  you use for you, that's the same thing, right? Like there's

1092
01:08:40,845 --> 01:08:43,365
Speaker 2:  a version of this that is kind of hacky, that is you teach the system how

1093
01:08:43,365 --> 01:08:47,085
Speaker 2:  to do it, but there's a much easier version that is just partnering with

1094
01:08:47,365 --> 01:08:50,685
Speaker 2:  companies that exist and have existing products. And for Rabbit,

1095
01:08:51,145 --> 01:08:54,925
Speaker 2:  if it can be that center point, the sort of place that you go to

1096
01:08:54,985 --> 01:08:58,765
Speaker 2:  use the apps, that's very powerful. OpenAI is trying to do the same thing

1097
01:08:58,765 --> 01:09:02,685
Speaker 2:  with the GPT store and Custom GPTs. Google I suspect

1098
01:09:02,745 --> 01:09:05,205
Speaker 2:  is going to start to push into that pretty hard. I think you're gonna start

1099
01:09:05,205 --> 01:09:09,085
Speaker 2:  to see Apple have AI APIs that you can plug into. The

1100
01:09:09,085 --> 01:09:12,845
Speaker 2:  idea is just If. you can be the sort of hub

1101
01:09:13,225 --> 01:09:16,965
Speaker 2:  for all the different features of AI that is going to be

1102
01:09:17,225 --> 01:09:20,685
Speaker 2:  hugely powerful. We've seen in this first phase, a bunch of companies kind

1103
01:09:20,685 --> 01:09:24,205
Speaker 2:  of try to do everything right. You build the one huge perfect model that

1104
01:09:24,205 --> 01:09:27,605
Speaker 2:  solves all your problems. Everybody uses it for everything. The end. I don't

1105
01:09:27,605 --> 01:09:30,925
Speaker 2:  think that's the future. I think the future is actually sort of an

1106
01:09:31,025 --> 01:09:35,005
Speaker 2:  interconnected galaxy of models and systems and tools

1107
01:09:35,005 --> 01:09:38,565
Speaker 2:  that you use. And so the question then is who sits in the middle? What is

1108
01:09:38,565 --> 01:09:42,285
Speaker 2:  the platform that you use that translates all of that stuff for you and

1109
01:09:42,295 --> 01:09:45,725
Speaker 2:  picks the right agent depending on what you need? And I suspect

1110
01:09:46,185 --> 01:09:49,245
Speaker 2:  all of these companies think that if they can be that platform, they can

1111
01:09:49,245 --> 01:09:53,045
Speaker 2:  make an awful lot of money off of being that platform. Hardware is

1112
01:09:53,195 --> 01:09:56,365
Speaker 2:  part of the business. I think actually a lot of these companies genuinely

1113
01:09:56,365 --> 01:10:00,005
Speaker 2:  would like to make money from their hardware. Rabbit is

1114
01:10:00,075 --> 01:10:02,845
Speaker 2:  hard to tell and frankly so is Humane if there's actually any money in it

1115
01:10:02,845 --> 01:10:06,485
Speaker 2:  right now, but they do seem to both wanna be hardware companies, but more

1116
01:10:06,485 --> 01:10:10,445
Speaker 2:  than that, they want to be platforms and you cannot build a

1117
01:10:10,605 --> 01:10:14,525
Speaker 2:  platform on top of iOS or Android. They just won. And as they push into

1118
01:10:14,665 --> 01:10:18,565
Speaker 2:  ai, they're going to entrench that even further, right? I think we're gonna

1119
01:10:18,565 --> 01:10:22,485
Speaker 2:  see a lot of AI stuff at WW DC, we're gonna see a lot of AI stuff at

1120
01:10:22,485 --> 01:10:26,365
Speaker 2:  Google io. Gemini is already all over Android. Those companies

1121
01:10:26,365 --> 01:10:30,125
Speaker 2:  are not interested in letting other AI platforms in and I think

1122
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:32,885
Speaker 2:  there's really interesting regulatory questions about whether they're going

1123
01:10:32,885 --> 01:10:36,805
Speaker 2:  to be forced to like what If, you picked your AI model the

1124
01:10:36,805 --> 01:10:40,325
Speaker 2:  same way you picked your default browser. Really interesting idea. These

1125
01:10:40,605 --> 01:10:44,485
Speaker 2:  companies will not do that unless they're forced to do that, so we'll see.

1126
01:10:44,865 --> 01:10:48,725
Speaker 2:  But the way that these companies are thinking is that the only way

1127
01:10:48,865 --> 01:10:52,845
Speaker 2:  in is to build a new thing that doesn't require a smartphone

1128
01:10:52,865 --> 01:10:56,765
Speaker 2:  and start to slowly siphon you away from these two

1129
01:10:57,045 --> 01:11:00,485
Speaker 2:  companies, Google and Apple that have essentially owned our internet experience

1130
01:11:00,945 --> 01:11:04,725
Speaker 2:  and have been between any company that wants to build something

1131
01:11:04,745 --> 01:11:08,605
Speaker 2:  and you for 15 years. That's a hard, hard, hard

1132
01:11:08,605 --> 01:11:12,445
Speaker 2:  thing to upset. It's why a lot of the antitrust stuff going

1133
01:11:12,445 --> 01:11:16,125
Speaker 2:  on right now, especially in the US is happening. And if

1134
01:11:16,225 --> 01:11:19,445
Speaker 2:  I'm a new company, that's the only reason I would build hardware because

1135
01:11:19,685 --> 01:11:23,525
Speaker 2:  building an app is too hard, there's too much stuff in the way and you're

1136
01:11:23,805 --> 01:11:26,965
Speaker 2:  probably just going to get eaten alive by Apple or Google. So that's the

1137
01:11:27,085 --> 01:11:30,805
Speaker 2:  cynical answer I hope for the non cynical answer and reality. In

1138
01:11:30,805 --> 01:11:34,325
Speaker 2:  reality, I think it's a little bit of both. Like we are in a phase where

1139
01:11:34,325 --> 01:11:37,285
Speaker 2:  there are interesting new ideas about hardware because there are interesting

1140
01:11:37,285 --> 01:11:40,605
Speaker 2:  new ideas about how we interact with technology. We're going to spend, I

1141
01:11:40,605 --> 01:11:44,445
Speaker 2:  think, less time tapping on our phones over time and less time

1142
01:11:44,445 --> 01:11:48,245
Speaker 2:  looking at screens just to do basic things. So

1143
01:11:48,465 --> 01:11:51,885
Speaker 2:  if that's the case, we are going to need new devices, but also

1144
01:11:52,065 --> 01:11:56,045
Speaker 2:  anyone trying to compete in those spaces knows that the

1145
01:11:56,045 --> 01:12:00,005
Speaker 2:  only real way to build a company the size of Google or Apple is to

1146
01:12:00,005 --> 01:12:03,565
Speaker 2:  do it outside of Google or Apple, and that's what everybody is desperately

1147
01:12:03,565 --> 01:12:07,165
Speaker 2:  trying to figure out. That said, all the AI stuff we've seen so far should

1148
01:12:07,165 --> 01:12:10,685
Speaker 2:  pretty much just be an app. I have yet to see the one that I am like, this

1149
01:12:11,105 --> 01:12:14,325
Speaker 2:  is a new category of device, but I'm holding out hope. I haven't tried all

1150
01:12:14,325 --> 01:12:18,245
Speaker 2:  the glasses yet. I'm excited to see. Alright, that is it
