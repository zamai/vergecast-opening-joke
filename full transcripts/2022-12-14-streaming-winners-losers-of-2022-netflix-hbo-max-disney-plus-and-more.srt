00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,240
Speaker 2:  You're listening to the Vergecast, the flagship podcast

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,520
Speaker 2:  of the Go 90 Scale of Doom Streaming Services. I'm your friend

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,440
Speaker 2:  Alex Kranz, and you notice that David's not here because this

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,840
Speaker 2:  is the first episode of the Wednesday show that I'm taking over. While David

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,960
Speaker 2:  is out caring for that, absolutely adorable baby, he and his wife just had,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,320
Speaker 2:  we're gonna have a really fun time over the next few weeks and we're gonna

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,840
Speaker 2:  have a bunch of Verge staff on the show to talk about all kinds of stuff.

9
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,920
Speaker 2:  And I will try not to have an EA segment every week, but

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,840
Speaker 2:  I will not promise to not have an EA segment every week. Anyway,

11
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,560
Speaker 2:  this episode is a really fun one because we're gonna be talking about all

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,400
Speaker 2:  the big streaming services. I mean Netflix, hbo, max,

13
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,760
Speaker 2:  Hulu, Disney Plus, peacock, paramount plus,

14
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,880
Speaker 2:  Amazon Prime, all of them. And we're gonna think about who are the winners

15
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,680
Speaker 2:  and who are the losers. And to do this, I of course have brought in

16
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,760
Speaker 2:  our Verge editor-in-Chief Eli Patel and our film and TV

17
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,360
Speaker 2:  reporter, Charles Pullam Moore, to go through each and every one of these

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,880
Speaker 2:  streaming companies and discuss how they were handled in 2022.

19
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,640
Speaker 2:  Buckle in for this one. I made people talk to me about this for over

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,520
Speaker 2:  an hour. It's a lot of fun, but I'm gonna go walk my

21
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,200
Speaker 2:  dog now. So I'll see you guys in a minute.

22
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:22,360
Speaker 3:  Support for this episode comes from Airbnb. If you've stayed

23
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,080
Speaker 3:  in one of Airbnb's unique homes all around the world, you may be wondering,

24
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,000
Speaker 3:  could my place be an Airbnb and what could I earn? You could be sitting

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,840
Speaker 3:  on an Airbnb right now. That might mean your extra guest room or

26
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,480
Speaker 3:  maybe even Airbnb your entire home while you're away on a long trip,

27
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,320
Speaker 3:  whether you could use some extra money to cover some of those surprise expenses

28
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,360
Speaker 3:  or maybe just a little something for yourself, your home might be

29
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,040
Speaker 3:  worth more than you think. Find out how much at

30
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,120

31
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,400
Speaker 4:  This episode is supported by NetApp. NetApp wants our listeners to know

32
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,120
Speaker 4:  that they are in love with the cloud. So in love they'd climb a mountain

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,000
Speaker 4:  or cross an ocean just to prove it, but that's not actually necessary.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,480
Speaker 4:  So instead they just made this podcast ad. NetApp makes the cloud work

35
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,080
Speaker 4:  smarter and harder by letting you automate processes, optimize

36
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,400
Speaker 4:  infrastructure access, and securely manage your data. No matter where it

37
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,720
Speaker 4:  is. NetApp, for the love of Cloud Vergecast, listeners can visit

38
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,400
Speaker 4:  netapp.com/verge to see how amazing the cloud can be.

39
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,280
Speaker 2:  All right, and we're back. I got ne Eli here who is the

40
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,040
Speaker 2:  streaming expert at the Verge.

41
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:32,920
Speaker 5:  Is that true?

42
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,760
Speaker 2:  I mean we can say it is. No one's here to stop us. And I have Charles Pull

43
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,200
Speaker 2:  Moore here who is our other streaming expert at The Verge.

44
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,360
Speaker 5:  I think he should stop us from saying that I'm the expert. I think Charles

45
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:42,920
Speaker 5:  is the expert.

46
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,200
Speaker 6:  I think we all have a little bit expertise when it comes to the different

47
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:46,760
Speaker 6:  platforms.

48
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,920
Speaker 5:  Fair enough.

49
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,600
Speaker 2:  And we're gonna talk about the winners and losers of streaming this year.

50
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,160
Speaker 2:  I know. Ha. I have my opinions. I know Charles has his opinions. Some of

51
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,800
Speaker 2:  them are very wrong. Oh wow. Charles, I saw your notes here about Paramount

52
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,960
Speaker 2:  Plus and I had to like had to take a moment. It's fine.

53
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,840
Speaker 6:  I'm very glad that you are watching Paramount Plus and keeping them afloat

54
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,280
Speaker 6:  with your Star Trek love. Well done. Well done. It's

55
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,120
Speaker 5:  All me. Well, there's also the Cowboy people. We got it. Well, we'll get

56
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,240
Speaker 5:  there,

57
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,400
Speaker 2:  We'll get there. We'll get there, we'll get there. Let's not get too far

58
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,320
Speaker 2:  ahead, but, so we're gonna be going through the winners and losers and first

59
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,280
Speaker 2:  up we're gonna talk about the biggest winner, the Biggest Loser. This

60
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,480
Speaker 2:  is the biggest right? Which is Netflix.

61
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,560
Speaker 6:  Yeah. That like, you know, the OG player in this space who taught

62
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,600
Speaker 6:  everybody that streaming was a real business that everyone needed to get

63
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,000
Speaker 6:  very serious about. And you know, I dunno, Netflix has just always been the

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,960
Speaker 6:  bellwether that everyone has looked to. And in this year of everyone's sort

65
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,000
Speaker 6:  of realizing that burning cash, you can't just do it

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,760
Speaker 6:  indefinitely. Like Netflix sort of being the one who taught everyone that

67
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,200
Speaker 6:  that's how you run this business, had to pump the brakes and be like, you

68
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,080
Speaker 6:  guys since these subscriber rates have sort of flattened and slowed down,

69
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,560
Speaker 6:  perhaps we need to cap our spending. Yeah.

70
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,040
Speaker 2:  Cuz they spent a lot of money this year. They

71
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,560
Speaker 6:  Spent, you know, 17 billion, which is both like an

72
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,520
Speaker 6:  ungodly amount of money. But it's also sort of like that is how

73
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,440
Speaker 6:  Netflix is able to be Netflix, right? It's like, let's throw cash at

74
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,160
Speaker 6:  this problem as much as we possibly can. So much so that you can't possibly

75
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,400
Speaker 6:  believe it. And that leads to, you know, the content gets married, subscribers

76
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,080
Speaker 6:  come on. But eventually you do sort of have to look at the bottom

77
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,960
Speaker 6:  line. Netflix in particular has realized like, look, there's a certain

78
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,880
Speaker 6:  degree to which shooting yourself in the foot this way. Can it be beneficial

79
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,760
Speaker 6:  if you're looking sort of down the road? But at some point you do have to

80
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,680
Speaker 6:  talk to yourself and rather realistic terms. Like my

81
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,960
Speaker 6:  foot isn't gonna keep regrowing back, you guys, we gotta sort of staunch

82
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,840
Speaker 6:  the bleeding. And everyone else who has sort of followed on Netflix's footsteps

83
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,360
Speaker 6:  looking at Netflix's example, has recognized like, oh, if we do everything

84
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,080
Speaker 6:  that Netflix does, we will also sort of be in the same position but not necessarily

85
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,000
Speaker 6:  have that same market share. So, you know, since Netflix has

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,560
Speaker 6:  sort of put out that call, rather put out that message to its investors,

87
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,520
Speaker 6:  we are capping our spending. All of the other streamers have been like, we

88
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,280
Speaker 6:  are also going to start capping our spending. Well, I'm also gonna

89
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,920
Speaker 6:  start trying to get more value out of, out of our wares

90
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,440
Speaker 6:  by just, you know, squeezing them a little bit tighter.

91
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,720
Speaker 2:  Let's talk about that, like the capping the spending thing there because

92
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,640
Speaker 2:  Netflix capped at spending and I feel like everybody in the

93
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,760
Speaker 2:  industry was kind of like, this is the death of Netflix. Like, like

94
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,520
Speaker 2:  it just went from like zero to everything's ruined really, really

95
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:25,800
Speaker 2:  quickly.

96
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:30,200
Speaker 5:  There's like a thing here that we should just for one second

97
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,960
Speaker 5:  highlight, which is this is the first time Netflix

98
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,440
Speaker 5:  has faced real competition. Right? So that

99
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,840
Speaker 5:  crazy curve where they were burning cash or burning money, they were doing

100
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,040
Speaker 5:  anything to get on people's TVs, they were chasing what

101
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,760
Speaker 5:  you might call a monopoly position for streaming and they achieved that

102
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,880
Speaker 5:  position. Yeah. Right? If, if you walked up to a random person and had to

103
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,760
Speaker 5:  guess what they subscribe to, Netflix would be the best bet. Right? Right.

104
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,480
Speaker 5:  In every single case, everyone has a Netflix subscription, right? That is

105
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,800
Speaker 5:  a very difficult thing to achieve. And Netflix more or less achieved it.

106
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,000
Speaker 5:  They're like out of people to get to subscribe to Netflix.

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,160
Speaker 6:  Right? And it's like we, it's we, we can joke about it, but like Netflix

108
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,040
Speaker 6:  when it's, it's funny during to-do, to-do whenever,

109
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:18,440
Speaker 6:  when, when Netflix starts talking about its presence like globally

110
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,680
Speaker 6:  and sort of like all the inroads that it's made in other countries, it's

111
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,520
Speaker 6:  often easy to sort of gloss over. Like Netflix is that girl, like

112
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,440
Speaker 6:  Netflix is the one who is sort of in this space launching international hits

113
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,320
Speaker 6:  like Disney plus Amazon Prime. They don't have like a squid

114
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,200
Speaker 6:  game, right? Yeah. Which is to say they don't have programming

115
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,000
Speaker 6:  that is not explicitly western focused, that still manages to take

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,480
Speaker 6:  over everything and sort of be in everyone's minds and sort of own that

117
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,880
Speaker 6:  mindshare. And so while the 17 billion

118
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,040
Speaker 6:  spend is, while it is also paid off for them in a way that is

119
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,880
Speaker 6:  undeniable. That being said, this is the cost that comes with

120
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,760
Speaker 6:  sort of being the trendsetter, sort of laying the blueprint

121
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,320
Speaker 6:  for everyone else. It makes it easier for everyone else to sort of catch

122
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,960
Speaker 6:  up to you, not necessarily get to your same level, but sort of

123
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,400
Speaker 6:  recreate your success to a certain extent enough so that you can become the

124
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,920
Speaker 6:  kind of competition that scares Netflix into not necessarily scares, well

125
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,160
Speaker 6:  gooses them into thinking well we have to think a little bit more strategically

126
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,880
Speaker 6:  about how we're gonna maintain our position and sort of

127
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,800
Speaker 6:  stave the like keep the competition out from being able to really steal our

128
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,000
Speaker 6:  lunch.

129
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:27,440
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Two, thanks. One, I feel as though I have to disclose that I'm the

130
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,600
Speaker 5:  EP of a Netflix show called Key. We should go watch a Netflix. It's great.

131
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,520
Speaker 5:  And also our company makes shows for every one of these streaming platforms.

132
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,720
Speaker 5:  So take, go watch all the Vox media shows on every platform. It's great.

133
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,720
Speaker 5:  Two, I think the really interesting thing about that competition moment is

134
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,520
Speaker 5:  Netflix. Even just last week, Reid Hastings was at the

135
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,000
Speaker 5:  DealBook conference that I was at and he was like, our competition is everything.

136
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:53,320
Speaker 5:  It's video games, it's the other streamers, it's TikTok, it's YouTube.

137
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,720
Speaker 5:  They think about their opportunity is, you know,

138
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,120
Speaker 5:  the hours and the day that you are watching something. Yeah. That you're

139
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,840
Speaker 5:  looking at a screen. They've kind of solved this problem by just throwing

140
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,600
Speaker 5:  money at it. If you push the button on your remote, Netflix is gonna

141
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,160
Speaker 5:  show you oceans of content. I think when we go talk about the other

142
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,640
Speaker 5:  streamers, they have solved this problem by saying, here's the best thing

143
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,240
Speaker 5:  you should watch. Right. That I think is where the, the real end of Netflix

144
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,960
Speaker 5:  stuff came from. Right? The strategy has shifted and now Netflix is gonna

145
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,840
Speaker 5:  spend less money, which means they're gonna have to make harder decisions

146
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,400
Speaker 5:  about what they spend money on, which just changes the dynamic

147
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,760
Speaker 5:  for everybody. Yeah.

148
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,520
Speaker 6:  Like we've all had that experience where you turn on Netflix and it's like,

149
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,360
Speaker 6:  I wanna watch something, what am I going to watch? And you're like, well

150
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:40,560
Speaker 6:  there's so much, there's so much. And their UI does, none

151
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,200
Speaker 6:  of the UIs are particularly good about like discovery, but nothing about

152
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,960
Speaker 6:  Netflix in particular lends itself to giving you a sense of

153
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,480
Speaker 6:  what you're gonna be in for. And you know, we live in the age of decision

154
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,400
Speaker 6:  paralysis, which I'd be very curious to hear what kind of internal conversations

155
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,760
Speaker 6:  Netflix has had about like, we need to, we need to make it easier for people

156
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,120
Speaker 6:  to sort of wanna try our things out without necessarily thinking that they

157
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,920
Speaker 6:  need to have the, you know, to go watch a show from beginning to end without

158
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,880
Speaker 6:  any kind of interruption. I think it's really telling that we've gotten into

159
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,680
Speaker 6:  a space where all of the streamers like to brag about our watched for something

160
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,920
Speaker 6:  like that sort of become the default metric that they use to tout the success

161
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,040
Speaker 6:  of a particular thing. Right? A metric that means nothing to regular people,

162
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,320
Speaker 6:  right? Like, ooh, like X billion million people watched

163
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,440
Speaker 6:  X hours of show. Like what that means nothing to me

164
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,960
Speaker 6:  as a regular watcher who it tries to stay away

165
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,800
Speaker 6:  from like that super fan investment like rah rah, like let's cheer for the

166
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,840
Speaker 6:  multi-billion dollar company. But I do think that it is

167
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,560
Speaker 6:  reflective of what you were saying earlier, that these companies are starting

168
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,760
Speaker 6:  to be a little bit more transparent about what success looks like to them

169
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,440
Speaker 6:  internally. Right. It isn't necessarily, obviously they all love it when

170
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,960
Speaker 6:  they get nominated for awards, right? Like I'm sure Hulu was overjoyed that

171
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,560
Speaker 6:  the, that the dropout not swept, but really sort of cleaned up. Yeah.

172
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,520
Speaker 6:  Cleaned up. But at the end of the day, like what they're really concerned

173
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,160
Speaker 6:  about is, is this a part of your, is this a part of your daily consumption

174
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,120
Speaker 6:  habit? Like are you, do you wake up and just reflexively turn the television

175
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,920
Speaker 6:  on, put something on and then just let it go for the rest of the day? Because

176
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,400
Speaker 6:  that's kind of, sort of what they all want.

177
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:14,320
Speaker 2:  No, because after three episodes it'll ask if you're still watching, Hmm

178
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,920
Speaker 5:  Hmm Netflix did fine, right? Are they the winner? Are they the loser? Like

179
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,840
Speaker 5:  who knows? But the underlying dynamic that got expressed that Netflix

180
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,520
Speaker 5:  got hit by hardest is you have to make a case

181
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,680
Speaker 5:  for people to spend money on you every month. And if

182
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,920
Speaker 5:  people aren't hitting that button on their remote every day or every couple

183
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,400
Speaker 5:  of days because you're just gonna give them something,

184
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,200
Speaker 5:  then your other option is to make hits. And hits are just

185
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,320
Speaker 5:  way harder. And where Netflix has had hits

186
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,840
Speaker 5:  is in stuff that has generated a lot of controversy, right. The

187
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,680
Speaker 5:  Chappelle specials or stuff that has gone viral on other

188
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,120
Speaker 5:  platforms for reasons no one could predict. Like we are in the middle of

189
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,320
Speaker 5:  the weird goth resurgence around Wednesday, which

190
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,120
Speaker 5:  is a former Skyliner boy, I don't, it's very confusing to me all

191
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,040
Speaker 5:  around, like everyone is just like cosplaying my teens right now. I don't

192
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,480
Speaker 5:  quite understand it, but it's, it's weird, right? Netflix doesn't have that

193
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:14,080
Speaker 5:  mark getting prowess that the hbos of the world do.

194
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:18,040
Speaker 5:  They don't create cultural moments cuz they just released everything as a

195
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,400
Speaker 5:  binge. So then Wednesday gets completely deco contextualized

196
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,520
Speaker 5:  into a Lady Gaga remixed video, which is great. Like I'm not,

197
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,400
Speaker 5:  I'm not knocking it at all. It just, that wasn't the plan, right? It

198
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,560
Speaker 5:  just happened to them. That

199
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,640
Speaker 6:  All speaks to how like Netflix has sort of just become terrestrial TV for

200
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,520
Speaker 6:  a lot of people. Yeah. Even though we are paying a premium forward, I think

201
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,160
Speaker 6:  is more kind to terrestrial TV than to

202
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,800
Speaker 6:  basic cable like the basic cable that we grew up with in that it is sort

203
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,160
Speaker 6:  of the expectation that you're going to have a Netflix subscription just

204
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,080
Speaker 6:  so that you can participate in, you know, the discourse about a

205
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,800
Speaker 6:  Wednesday, the discourse, I'm thinking way back to like the early hits of

206
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,720
Speaker 6:  Netflix had like the orange is the New Black. It was just sort of the thing

207
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,160
Speaker 6:  that you talked about. But this is the downside to being the big fish in

208
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,080
Speaker 6:  the pond. Right? Eventually people stop thinking about you as that

209
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,040
Speaker 6:  young upstart that's doing bold, ambitious, I'm thinking again

210
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,920
Speaker 6:  of orange, the new black things things versus this sort

211
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,880
Speaker 6:  of stayed safe bets that draw their success

212
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,840
Speaker 6:  from controversy. Like Chappelle Teran is coming out

213
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,200
Speaker 6:  and being like, we are gonna keep green lighting Chappelle specials

214
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,440
Speaker 6:  until people stop watching them says to me like, oh, like that's not, that's

215
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,840
Speaker 6:  not the position of an executive who's confident in

216
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,520
Speaker 6:  the studio's ability to create, to create up. Its on its own. Exactly.

217
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,400
Speaker 6:  It really that to me does say like, well that's safe. It doesn't

218
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,960
Speaker 6:  telegraph strength to me.

219
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,280
Speaker 2:  We've seen that too with how Netflix has been very eager to

220
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:49,560
Speaker 2:  like, watch Disney go on this IP binging and just buy

221
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,440
Speaker 2:  up all the different ips and, and Paramount's done it and HBO's

222
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,400
Speaker 2:  done it and Amazon Prime has done it. Everybody's done it and Netflix kind

223
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,760
Speaker 2:  of got left out in the cold. And so they're like, okay, we need, we need

224
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,520
Speaker 2:  IP too. And so like Adams family Wednesday would not be a

225
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,840
Speaker 2:  success probably if it didn't have that Adams family IP attached to it. If

226
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,720
Speaker 2:  it was just about a weird goth girl go into her school with her wear all

227
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,440
Speaker 2:  friends, look,

228
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,120
Speaker 5:  The world needs more original IP about young

229
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,400
Speaker 5:  goth teens and their werewolf friends just in general.

230
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,160
Speaker 5:  And I don't know why we got away from it and I think we should go back,

231
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,800
Speaker 2:  But like you've seen it even happen on Netflix itself. It's done similar

232
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,600
Speaker 2:  shows that just haven't had that same reach. And because there was that,

233
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,880
Speaker 2:  that IP connection, we've seen it with the Witcher, that's like their big

234
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,960
Speaker 2:  IP bend. There are only success in, in creating their own IP

235
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,520
Speaker 2:  has really been Stranger things into an extent Squid game, right?

236
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,440
Speaker 5:  Well, no. So Bridger 10 is huge.

237
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,760
Speaker 6:  People loved Ozark,

238
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,360
Speaker 2:  But Bridger was based on a very successful series of, of romance

239
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:50,320
Speaker 2:  novels that have been out for years. And I guess the other one you said

240
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,120
Speaker 2:  Ozark, that's a fair, that's a fair one.

241
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,520
Speaker 6:  In in, in the grand scheme of like winners and there just, Netflix is fine,

242
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,200
Speaker 6:  right? Like Netflix, all, all of the calls like, ah, Netflix is doomed. Like

243
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,120
Speaker 6:  everyone, everyone likes that narrative because it's fun, right? In the same

244
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,920
Speaker 6:  way that it's fun that Netflix has a show, two shows, excuse me about Blockbuster.

245
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,200
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Everyone gets like a little bit of a thrill out of like, oh, is Netflix

246
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,560
Speaker 6:  finally gonna fall off the throne? Maybe, but like this isn't the year forward.

247
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,960
Speaker 6:  Exactly. Like if and when we do see them really sort of take a tumble,

248
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,960
Speaker 6:  it's not probably going to be like a very dramatic and

249
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,800
Speaker 6:  immediate thing. It is just going to be a slow winnowing of the market share

250
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,400
Speaker 6:  that comes, you know, as a function of the competition just being stronger

251
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:27,920
Speaker 6:  and smarter.

252
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,800
Speaker 2:  Okay. So if we had to say Netflix was a winner or loser,

253
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,400
Speaker 5:  No, we gotta do this first Castile go 90 scale of Doom Streaming services.

254
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:39,000
Speaker 5:  Okay? Zero is Alive, okay. And 90 is dead

255
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,360
Speaker 5:  in honor of Go 90, the streaming service from Verizon, which

256
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,400
Speaker 5:  honestly Verizon was like, here's what you want to do. You want a YouTube

257
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,760
Speaker 5:  where you join a gang. That was basically their pitch for it bundled on your

258
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,720
Speaker 5:  mid-range and Android phone. So Zero is alive, 90 is dead.

259
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,520
Speaker 5:  I'm putting Netflix, like Netflix was flatly at zero, right? Yeah, yeah.

260
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,120
Speaker 5:  For a long time. I'll, I'll put 'em at like five.

261
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,040
Speaker 2:  I'm gonna put 'em at three unless they cancel a show I'm really

262
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,960
Speaker 2:  into right now. In which case 90,

263
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:09,040
Speaker 5:  If Netflix cancels a show that a fan base is into, they're like 90 immediately,

264
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,920
Speaker 5:  immediately. Two saying is out of control. My argument

265
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,080
Speaker 5:  for five is like they've never faced competition like this. And they are

266
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:20,120
Speaker 5:  reorienting the company, they're rolling out ads, they're doing all this

267
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,440
Speaker 5:  stuff that is unproven. So there's an element of risk

268
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,880
Speaker 5:  to Netflix that has not existed before, which takes 'em to five.

269
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,560
Speaker 2:  All right, I'm at five asterisks. 90 if they cancel

270
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,640
Speaker 2:  Warrior none. Charles, where are you?

271
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:37,360
Speaker 6:  I think they're at like a two. Okay. I think I, I, I think I'm trying to,

272
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,320
Speaker 6:  I'm trying to weirdly, my mind immediately went to like, at what point

273
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:45,520
Speaker 6:  in House of the Dragon, right? At what point at like at King

274
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,920
Speaker 6:  VAs is like Decrepitness is Netflix right now

275
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,360
Speaker 6:  and I think it's still like early in the season, right? Like there's just

276
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,320
Speaker 6:  maybe like a little pock mark, just one or two, so Oh, I

277
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,480
Speaker 5:  See. Wow. So in a long enough timeline, every streaming service

278
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,960
Speaker 6:  Oh, in a long enough timeline just face falling off. Right?

279
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,320
Speaker 5:  Fair enough. Yeah. By the way, this thing about the scale is really funny

280
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,240
Speaker 5:  cuz if I had said ten first all of you would've both said five, but I said

281
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,760
Speaker 5:  five. So you're like two and three. Two and three. This is like, this is

282
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,480
Speaker 5:  how you mess with the numbers. I'm just letting you know what you do

283
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,480
Speaker 5:  anchoring. It's like a real thing. All right. But five, that's what we're

284
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,240
Speaker 5:  saying for Netflix. 5, 2, 3. Okay,

285
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,200
Speaker 2:  Let's talk about one that is like probably closer to the 90 side

286
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,360
Speaker 2:  right now. HBO Max,

287
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,120
Speaker 6:  Speaking of Game of Thrones

288
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,960
Speaker 2:  Slash discovery, you have it here. So Charles worked a lot on the

289
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,400
Speaker 2:  rundown for this episode. Charles, you, you have the two kind of bundled

290
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,080
Speaker 2:  together.

291
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:40,240
Speaker 6:  So like in my mind, H v o Max and Discovery Plus are still two

292
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,160
Speaker 6:  separate entities. Okay. Like we, I I get that internally, Warner Brothers

293
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,680
Speaker 6:  discovery is like, these two things are soon to emerge and be called Max.

294
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,200
Speaker 6:  And if and when, like when I can download death,

295
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,400
Speaker 5:  That, that just stop it. Look, everybody

296
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,040
Speaker 6:  Stop it. When I can download Max the app from the app store

297
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,960
Speaker 6:  onto my, onto my TV and onto my phone, then I will officially be like,

298
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,560
Speaker 6:  all right, the, the merger is done.

299
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,440
Speaker 5:  I'm just saying there are people in this world named Max, including one that

300
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,440
Speaker 5:  I am very responsible for and I think they're all mad.

301
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,440
Speaker 6:  Congratulations on Max new app, that's gonna be great.

302
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:17,440
Speaker 2:  They had a year, right? Like, like David Zaslav finally they finished

303
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,320
Speaker 2:  the merger of, of the companies not obviously of the apps. They

304
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,200
Speaker 2:  finished the merger, DA David Zaslav came on, he originally did that kind

305
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Speaker 2:  of tour. He went and talked to a lot of execs, a lot of people in the industry

306
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,800
Speaker 2:  and was like, Hey, I'm just a cool guy here to make some cool content

307
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,400
Speaker 6:  Emphasis on content.

308
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:37,040
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And then, and then things got a little messy.

309
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:41,240
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I mean if you call like the raising of villages and the salton of

310
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,000
Speaker 6:  Earth messy Sure. You know, there were

311
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,760
Speaker 6:  just lots of big fires everywhere with H V O

312
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,680
Speaker 6:  this year. I mean I think we all sort of remember the famous like, oh like

313
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,600
Speaker 6:  things are just disappearing from H B O Max left to right. Yeah, yeah. What's,

314
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,000
Speaker 6:  what's going on? Oh, back girl's not gonna come out. It's done. But like

315
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,200
Speaker 6:  we're not gonna release it because it would be prudent for us to just take

316
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,080
Speaker 6:  the tax right off rather than Sully H B o Max's good name by

317
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,600
Speaker 6:  putting out this, you know, this

318
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,000
Speaker 5:  Mediocre,

319
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,920
Speaker 6:  Apparently we'll never know. But I mean like the, when people look back on

320
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,560
Speaker 6:  2022 for H V O Max and Discovery, it will be the year that David

321
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,160
Speaker 6:  Asla came in and started the cleanup house under the auspices of getting

322
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,640
Speaker 6:  the company on track to be more financially solvent. Right.

323
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,320
Speaker 6:  More into the business of putting out movies

324
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,760
Speaker 6:  for theatrical releases that then have pretty sizable theatrical

325
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,320
Speaker 6:  windows before they eventually make the jump to the streaming services months

326
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,720
Speaker 6:  after. And a lot of that was course correction from

327
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,680
Speaker 6:  2021, right. That those Halian days of the pandemic where

328
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,880
Speaker 6:  people could not go Right. When people were not going to movie theaters.

329
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,240
Speaker 6:  Right. And the studios were clumped and unsure what to do

330
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,640
Speaker 6:  and the old guard was like, put it all in max.

331
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:54,640
Speaker 5:  Well they were not necessarily old guard. Like we can't talk about

332
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,160
Speaker 5:  H B O Max and what is happening to it now. No, without talking about the

333
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,840
Speaker 5:  fact that at and t bought this whole company Okay. Had no

334
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,520
Speaker 5:  idea what to do with it. Their entire theory

335
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:09,440
Speaker 5:  of buying this company was we're gonna preload

336
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:13,480
Speaker 5:  Warner Brothers content on at and t phones. Like

337
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,400
Speaker 5:  that's what they wanted to do. Like if you bought an Android phone from

338
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,960
Speaker 5:  at and t, they were gonna preload it with apps that

339
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,720
Speaker 5:  delivered like bite-sized versions of Game of Thrones to you. And that's

340
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,680
Speaker 5:  why you would buy at and t phones over Verizon phones. I cannot even believe

341
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,560
Speaker 5:  that I am saying this like hundreds, thousands

342
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,360
Speaker 5:  of richly paid executives and consultants came up with

343
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,240
Speaker 5:  this plan that just saying out loud to the vergecast audience plainly,

344
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,480
Speaker 5:  I know what people are doing. Yeah. They're crashing their cars and jumping

345
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,320
Speaker 5:  off bridges cuz it's so stupid. But this was their

346
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,080
Speaker 5:  plan was that they would differentiate at and t's network by

347
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,000
Speaker 5:  having Warner Brothers content. Yeah. Which is

348
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,680
Speaker 5:  a plan that has failed every single fucking time. Anyone has ever tried it.

349
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,320
Speaker 5:  Do you know who else tried aol, tried to do that with Warner Brothers content?

350
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,520
Speaker 5:  Does anyone know who owns AOL now? Like no,

351
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,560
Speaker 5:  it's a disaster. And so they spent all this money, they hired Jason

352
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,520
Speaker 5:  Colar to come in and like beat ahead of the studio and he wasn't like,

353
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,000
Speaker 5:  I'm afraid of what's happening with pandemic audiences. He said, I'm pulling

354
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,920
Speaker 5:  the lever on streaming as hard as I can using the

355
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,720
Speaker 5:  opportunity, the pandemic screw you theater, screw you Hollywood,

356
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,320
Speaker 5:  a-list talent that has backend deals to get profit from theater revenue.

357
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,240
Speaker 5:  Right? All that stuff he just said, screw it, the pandemic is an excuse and

358
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,960
Speaker 5:  basically broke the studio. Whatever his as is doing

359
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,680
Speaker 5:  now, it seems like he is being very harsh. I

360
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:44,640
Speaker 5:  I I don't disagree. I just like what he was handed, what he bought

361
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,880
Speaker 5:  was a disaster of at t's making. And like

362
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,360
Speaker 5:  you, I don't think that there's a way out of that disaster without the perception

363
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:52,880
Speaker 5:  of harshness.

364
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:56,320
Speaker 6:  So like, I'm looking at this from the perspective of a consumer, right? Like

365
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,320
Speaker 6:  for a hot second there, H v o Max was sort of the awkward late

366
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,240
Speaker 6:  to the game sibling. Everyone's like, well what is H V O Max supposed to

367
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,880
Speaker 6:  be? Exactly. What is my interest in this outside of

368
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,040
Speaker 6:  watching things that are just gonna be h on hbo o And for a while HBO

369
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,640
Speaker 6:  Max sort of was coming into its own as having, having

370
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,320
Speaker 6:  interesting content, having rather interesting original content in interesting

371
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,760
Speaker 6:  original series as well as like the the established HBO o brands. But then

372
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,360
Speaker 6:  they were getting all of these, you know, blockbuster movies

373
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,400
Speaker 6:  immediately onto the platform. And from the consumer

374
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,800
Speaker 6:  perspective, like that was the dream, right? It was like, look, I will pay

375
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,040
Speaker 6:  a premium. I will pay like a premium premium. Even if, even if we weren't

376
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,600
Speaker 6:  necessarily dealing with the pandemic, if the studios were like, Hey, welcome

377
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,600
Speaker 6:  to our app, pay us anywhere between 30 to $60 to

378
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,880
Speaker 6:  watch the movie that is in the theater right now. Watch it here on the app.

379
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,920
Speaker 6:  People have been wanting something like that for the longest time. And H

380
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,760
Speaker 6:  v o max, you know, through all of these, you know, all,

381
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,160
Speaker 6:  all of the, the situation was able to give people something like that.

382
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,600
Speaker 6:  And because all of these platforms, not as the platforms, but the

383
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,240
Speaker 6:  companies that own them are constantly paying attention to one another for

384
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:09,160
Speaker 6:  a few months. There was the dream like, is this going to be the direction

385
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,560
Speaker 6:  that they all go in? Are they all gonna start prioritizing streaming in this

386
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,840
Speaker 6:  way because they understand that that's where eyeballs are. Were we going

387
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,200
Speaker 6:  to be on the precipice of a sea change where people just weren't flocking

388
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,640
Speaker 6:  the theaters the way that they used to? Which is why you saw, you know, last

389
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,440
Speaker 6:  year, the year before this really big hmm push for the

390
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,680
Speaker 6:  sentimental appeals to the theater going like, Hey you guys

391
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,840
Speaker 6:  movies are where we fall in love and where we discover ourselves and it's

392
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,720
Speaker 6:  like funny, look, I know you wanna sell this popcorn but you gotta calm down

393
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,640
Speaker 6:  with all that. Cause it's doing a lot. It's doing a lot.

394
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:44,160
Speaker 6:  But now you know, you know, DESSOLVE comes in and he is

395
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,080
Speaker 6:  a businessman, right? You are right. He's looking at this like, y'all we're

396
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,880
Speaker 6:  not, we're not gonna be solvent if we keep moving like

397
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,600
Speaker 6:  this. And so as plan, as best as we can tell from looking from the outside

398
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,520
Speaker 6:  in has really just been to cut spend to cut spend

399
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:02,640
Speaker 6:  in the long term. In the short term that looks like, all right, we

400
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,520
Speaker 6:  need to free up space on the platform for cheaper

401
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:10,440
Speaker 6:  content that we are going to eventually start producing four max

402
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,120
Speaker 6:  in the future. You can have your feelings about whether or not

403
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,320
Speaker 6:  the clearing of house could have been done in a more

404
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,520
Speaker 6:  judicious and quiet and less sort of like bombastic kind of

405
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:21,720
Speaker 6:  way.

406
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:25,680
Speaker 2:  Yeah. They were pulling stuff off. A lot of animated shows I know got

407
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,520
Speaker 2:  pulled with the, the creators not even knowing about it and suddenly there's

408
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,680
Speaker 2:  like just zero way to watch their their shows they they worked on.

409
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,600
Speaker 6:  And that's why, not that I'm coming out as a defender

410
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,960
Speaker 6:  of Zaslav, but like when you look at everything that he's done on paper,

411
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,600
Speaker 6:  you, you can see what he is doing. Yeah. He's trying, he's trying, he's trying

412
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,480
Speaker 6:  to save money. The issue and the reason that people have begun to

413
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,240
Speaker 6:  look at Zaslav and W B D in such a dim light is

414
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,560
Speaker 6:  just because of his methodology, right. Just because there does seem to be

415
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,440
Speaker 6:  a lack of care and attention being paid to the fact that, you know,

416
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,400
Speaker 6:  these, the content is the work of artists and creators, some

417
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,320
Speaker 6:  of whom this is their life's work, right? And it is, it is disheartening

418
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,720
Speaker 6:  to see your baby sort of just like thrown off the ship in the name of,

419
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,800
Speaker 6:  you know what I mean, in the bottom line,

420
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:14,680
Speaker 2:  Buried in the vault, never to be seen unless he has to pay

421
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,840
Speaker 2:  the i r s back.

422
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,680
Speaker 6:  The winnowing of Max also came again, not to bring it back to

423
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,120
Speaker 6:  award season, but it came at a, it came in a year where an H V O had a really

424
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,040
Speaker 6:  strong showing, you know, throughout award season, you know, succession

425
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,240
Speaker 6:  hacks, euphoria, the White Lotus, they were nominated, they were

426
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,880
Speaker 6:  winning these awards and it, you know, did sort of play into this idea like,

427
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,280
Speaker 6:  oh H v o Max, you know, to what you were saying earlier, H v O Max isn't

428
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,840
Speaker 6:  just a streaming platform, it's a streaming platform that's putting out really

429
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,600
Speaker 6:  good content. Things that people like, things that fans like critics. Like

430
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,120
Speaker 6:  it's something that's actually worth the investment of your time and energy.

431
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,720
Speaker 6:  And then to see the platform just having an ax taken to it,

432
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:55,280
Speaker 6:  it really sort of felt like, ah, why would you do this? Like why would you

433
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,440
Speaker 6:  do it? Especially since you've gotten the platform in such a, a healthy,

434
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,400
Speaker 6:  good, productive space at this point.

435
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,440
Speaker 5:  But there's two parts to that which I think are fascinating. One, if

436
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,720
Speaker 5:  you had to ask me what I would cut down to right now, I would pick HBO O

437
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:07,920
Speaker 5:  max.

438
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,240
Speaker 2:  Right? Same.

439
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,960
Speaker 5:  What is most consistently winning an hour of my evening? It's HBO O max,

440
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,240
Speaker 5:  right? It just has some of the, the most interesting stuff on it. If I had

441
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,520
Speaker 5:  to pick two, it'd be HBO, O Max and Netflix for sure. But if you had to just

442
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,320
Speaker 5:  ask me like, you get one and probably pick HBO Max just cause I get

443
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,760
Speaker 5:  mine the archive of movies and be happy for a long time, right? But that's

444
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,800
Speaker 5:  hbo I think what, what got the whole platform

445
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:32,720
Speaker 5:  kind of sideways is they added in all this other stuff, including

446
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,760
Speaker 5:  the Noise of Warner in DC and

447
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,600
Speaker 5:  HBO itself. The thing that makes really good TV shows just

448
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,560
Speaker 5:  had to like carry the weight of the, like they're not cutting a bunch

449
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,440
Speaker 5:  of HBO content. They're cutting a bunch of like Warner Brothers movies and

450
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,040
Speaker 5:  animated series stuff that like makes no sense and now they're gonna like

451
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,640
Speaker 5:  smash it together with Max and add a bunch of reality TV

452
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,880
Speaker 5:  stuff and like TLC stuff.

453
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,320
Speaker 2:  Well they've already started adding it, right? Like, like we saw all, you

454
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,000
Speaker 2:  know, they, they bragged about how Chip and Joanne Gaines's new

455
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:08,560
Speaker 2:  special about rebuilding a castle in Waco, Texas

456
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,640
Speaker 2:  was one of the, the most watched things on HBO Max this year. Like, like

457
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,760
Speaker 2:  they're already testing it and, and pushing that stuff.

458
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,720
Speaker 5:  One thing that is true about this entire conversation is that

459
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,560
Speaker 5:  there's no accounting for taste. And so like you can say

460
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,760
Speaker 5:  whatever you want and then you look at the most popular list and it's always

461
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:30,000
Speaker 5:  just the, the craziest garbage is the most pop. Yeah. Like the Big

462
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,760
Speaker 5:  Bang Theory was the most popular show in America for years running.

463
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,960
Speaker 6:  And Zaslav is very transparent. He's like, look, you can have your critical

464
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,160
Speaker 6:  darlings and you can have your little Emmys, but so long as the kids are

465
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,640
Speaker 6:  tuning into Chip and go Joanna Gaines, we're going to be be green lighting

466
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,600
Speaker 6:  more of this. Right? And while we can have our feelings about that like a

467
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,680
Speaker 6:  business perspective, that is a smart kind of move. Now I

468
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,240
Speaker 6:  would also be curious to hear from anyone within

469
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:58,520
Speaker 6:  H V O or rather from W V D, like how much does the prestige

470
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,480
Speaker 6:  perception matter to the company, right? Like arguably part

471
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,240
Speaker 6:  of HBO Max's success was the fact that it was able to ride the H B O brand

472
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,480
Speaker 6:  and sort of like HBO o as a brand is one of these like intergenerational

473
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,400
Speaker 6:  names that really just sort of consistently means quality to

474
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,160
Speaker 6:  people within like the entertainment space and to see

475
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,160
Speaker 6:  the direction that the company is turning towards with Max. I

476
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,120
Speaker 6:  wonder whether or not, like obviously we've heard rumblings like, oh there

477
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,440
Speaker 6:  will be like an H V O hub within Max where you can go for

478
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:31,920
Speaker 6:  a four year white lotus, but is the company concerned about people just

479
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,800
Speaker 6:  seeing Max as like the least imagining Lee named of the

480
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,000
Speaker 6:  service

481
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,680
Speaker 5:  Because it was a great name for a little girl. I just wanna put that out

482
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,480
Speaker 5:  there. It's a horrible name for streaming service. Four years ago

483
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,960
Speaker 5:  was a killer name for our daughter.

484
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,800
Speaker 2:  Extremely good name for a kid.

485
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,640
Speaker 5:  So I think one of the things here is like, I don't know that this is true,

486
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,520
Speaker 5:  but I know this is the theory is that allowing HBO to become a

487
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,360
Speaker 5:  tile inside of a Mac, an app called Max allows HBO to

488
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,560
Speaker 5:  maintain its brand the same way that allowing Lucas film or Marvel to be

489
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,520
Speaker 5:  tiles in Disney plus allow them to be somewhat distinct. But

490
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,320
Speaker 5:  the Halo brand there is Disney and here the Halo

491
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,120
Speaker 5:  brand is Max. And I just, and and also like the

492
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,080
Speaker 5:  feelings you get from Marvel are close enough to the

493
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,920
Speaker 5:  feelings you get from Lucas film are close enough to the feelings you

494
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,800
Speaker 5:  get from Pixar. Like Disney makes a thing that is expressed through

495
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,720
Speaker 5:  these gigantic franchises. The feelings you get from

496
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,440
Speaker 5:  the White Lotus should not be the feelings you get from Chip and

497
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,200
Speaker 5:  Joanna Gaines, but like that's the problem, right? There's a,

498
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,920
Speaker 5:  there's an emotional and creative mismatch between the tiles

499
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,360
Speaker 5:  inside of the, the forthcoming Max app.

500
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:45,280
Speaker 2:  I love to rip on EZ Love because I think a lot of what he's done has not

501
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,000
Speaker 2:  been done delicately enough and he could've, he could've saved people a lot

502
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,920
Speaker 2:  of heartaches with better communication than things. But he is a TV guy,

503
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,760
Speaker 2:  he's like a terrestrial TV guy. Yeah. Like he, he turned discovery from

504
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,680
Speaker 2:  this little tiny like random assortment of the learning

505
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,640
Speaker 2:  channel and these other things into Discovery, which is kind

506
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,640
Speaker 2:  of a behemoth in the cable space now. And, and his plan is to do the same

507
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,320
Speaker 2:  here. He, he, he knows that like brands matter and he

508
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,160
Speaker 2:  knows that he knows how people watch tv I think is the,

509
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,920
Speaker 2:  the most crucial thing here. And his kind of bet is that

510
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,600
Speaker 2:  people are moving from terrestrial tv, they're gonna move to just

511
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,440
Speaker 2:  paying companies directly instead of paying their cable operators

512
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,400
Speaker 2:  instead of watching stuff and sitting through ads. And so

513
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:35,560
Speaker 2:  his bet is like, I'm gonna build the new terrestrial TV and

514
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,440
Speaker 2:  you're gonna give all of your money to me because I'm gonna have discovery

515
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,400
Speaker 2:  and I'm gonna have HBO and I'm gonna have your little superheroes over

516
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,360
Speaker 2:  here. And I know he talks about them that way. He says they're the

517
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,280
Speaker 2:  little superheroes,

518
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:51,200
Speaker 5:  Little baby Batmans go 90 scale time. So

519
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,760
Speaker 5:  technically H Rio Max is at 90. This is gone.

520
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,440
Speaker 5:  We already know it's gone. Well

521
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,000
Speaker 2:  It's technically at 89, it's at like 89 until

522
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,360
Speaker 6:  It's gone. Gone, gone, gone, gone. It's not a 90 but

523
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,640
Speaker 6:  it's packing up,

524
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:09,920
Speaker 5:  It's looking for the door checked out. It has senioritis. Yeah. And so is

525
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,720
Speaker 5:  Discovery. I start every new streaming service out at 45, 50, 50

526
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,320
Speaker 5:  shot. So I would say Max the new service has a 50 50 shot at 45.

527
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,520
Speaker 2:  I'm like a 20. Okay,

528
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,120
Speaker 5:  Really?

529
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,320
Speaker 2:  Again, I dislike Zaslav, but he's a business guy and

530
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,560
Speaker 2:  he knows how to get people's eyeballs on stuff.

531
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:30,080
Speaker 5:  I've decided to, to be a zla apologist. I know Charles was like

532
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,800
Speaker 5:  dancing around. I'm like full on. Like do it slash and burn. Let's see what

533
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,600
Speaker 5:  happens. Everyone's too polite do some Eon stuff.

534
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,760
Speaker 2:  Like I think if he, I think if he can separate it enough and be like,

535
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,720
Speaker 2:  yeah, I'm gonna have, I'm still gonna have my H B O section over here, so

536
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,240
Speaker 2:  you wanna go do some artsy shit that'll win you some awards. You go hit up

537
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,200
Speaker 2:  my H B O guy, but you wanna make some money? I'm over here with Chip and

538
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,560
Speaker 2:  Joanne,

539
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:56,600
Speaker 6:  So, okay, we're starting at like a baseline of 45. I put it

540
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,320
Speaker 6:  at like a 60. Oh yeah. I think that we are at a point where there is

541
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,320
Speaker 6:  fatigue amongst consumers for signing up for these things. I do think I,

542
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,680
Speaker 6:  I think realistically there is a degree to which people are kind of tired

543
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,560
Speaker 6:  of being sold on the idea of new subscription platforms and that there

544
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:15,280
Speaker 6:  is, at least I'm speaking, I'm speaking to my own experience. I'm very comfortable

545
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,800
Speaker 6:  with the subscriptions that I have and the idea of getting logged in into

546
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,480
Speaker 6:  a new thing really does kind of fill me with a, an existential dread that

547
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,360
Speaker 6:  I don't think is unique. But yeah, Zaslav, he's not, if he were

548
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,200
Speaker 6:  canceling successful H B O shows left and right then yeah the future would

549
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,960
Speaker 6:  look pretty bleak. But as it stands now, while our faves

550
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,760
Speaker 6:  may be getting the acts, like the things that people are watching on the

551
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,880
Speaker 6:  platform, they are performing very well and he's made clear as intention

552
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,640
Speaker 6:  to make more of it. So will Max at least be around

553
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,480
Speaker 6:  for five years?

554
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,680
Speaker 5:  Probably. I can't wait for us to spend 15 minutes on Peacock,

555
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,960
Speaker 5:  but we've like in our feelings on Netflix and HBO Max and like

556
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,040
Speaker 5:  we have to get to Peacock still.

557
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,120
Speaker 2:  Okay, we're gonna get back to Peacock and Disney Plus and more, but first

558
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,200
Speaker 2:  we're gonna take a break, we'll be right back.

577
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,910
Speaker 3:  Today's episode is sponsored by Airbnb. Airbnb

578
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:23,310
Speaker 3:  lets you book comfortable stays all around the world so comfortable they

579
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:26,710
Speaker 3:  might even feel like home, which might lead you to wonder could my place

580
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:30,470
Speaker 3:  be an Airbnb? And if it was, what could it earn? The exciting

581
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:34,230
Speaker 3:  answer to that question is that right now you could be sitting on an Airbnb

582
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:37,430
Speaker 3:  and not even know it. Maybe you have a spare room that's already a haven

583
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:41,190
Speaker 3:  for visiting friends and family. So why not make it an Airbnb

584
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:44,830
Speaker 3:  and make some extra cash instead of letting it sit empty. Some people

585
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,550
Speaker 3:  Airbnb their entire homes when they're away for holidays or a big trip.

586
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:51,910
Speaker 3:  That's a great way to help cover the plane tickets. Whether you could use

587
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:55,830
Speaker 3:  a little extra money to stash away for a rainy day or you're saving up for

588
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:59,790
Speaker 3:  something fun, your home might be worth more than you think. Find out

589
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:02,870
Speaker 3:  how much at airbnb.com/host.

590
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:12,800
Speaker 2:  Okay, we're back. All right Eli Charles, let's talk about one

591
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,680
Speaker 2:  more big bi myth in the room. Disney plus, hmm Big year

592
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,920
Speaker 2:  this year. Obviously the end of this year has been huge for them. Chap is

593
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,840
Speaker 2:  out i's back and Iger has been pretty

594
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,400
Speaker 2:  vocal about what he wanted to see from the platform, I think especially at

595
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:31,120
Speaker 2:  Recode earlier this year or at Code conference earlier this year.

596
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:35,120
Speaker 2:  So what, what's, what's going on there? Like how are we feeling about I Disney

597
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,840
Speaker 2:  plus right now before we get to the ratings, the scores?

598
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,440
Speaker 6:  I mean from a content perspective I think that Disney

599
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:46,120
Speaker 6:  plus it's the best example of a studio

600
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:50,360
Speaker 6:  having that vertical system in place. It's like, hey, here's our

601
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,920
Speaker 6:  thing and we filled it with all of our stuff that you love so much, why don't

602
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,880
Speaker 6:  you come pay as a premium forward? Of course you will. You love us And it

603
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,280
Speaker 6:  has proven consistently to just sort of the

604
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,800
Speaker 6:  the dream from that perspective. But obviously it's not necessarily the comp,

605
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,560
Speaker 6:  it's not, it doesn't have the same kind of subscriber rates that it wants.

606
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:11,600
Speaker 6:  That being said, I in in being sort of like, hey we are the home for

607
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,880
Speaker 6:  Disney things, it in my mind has always sort of been like, yeah it's the

608
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,240
Speaker 6:  Disney one, right? The selection is less diverse

609
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:22,520
Speaker 6:  in terms of what it is that you can get when you open up the app.

610
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:26,640
Speaker 6:  And while that is definitely a feature rather than a

611
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,040
Speaker 6:  bug, I think for a lot of people it does just like compare it to the other

612
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,800
Speaker 6:  ones. It just makes it look like, like a less dynamic kind of space. In the

613
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,080
Speaker 6:  grand picture of things we would,

614
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:38,840
Speaker 2:  Here's my question. If you, you didn't have a small

615
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,320
Speaker 2:  child or you didn't watch a lot of

616
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:46,720
Speaker 2:  Star Wars and Willow, everybody should watch it, it's great, but you

617
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,720
Speaker 2:  didn't have that kinda like that nerd Gene and you didn't have a child.

618
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,400
Speaker 6:  Do you have a plus subscription?

619
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,480
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Do you have one? And I don't think you do, right?

620
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:56,920
Speaker 6:  I mean unless you're really, really, really into the Simpsons I guess. But

621
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,600
Speaker 6:  I think you can get that on who,

622
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,800
Speaker 2:  But then you're a nerd. Like if you're that into the Simpsons, you're a nerd,

623
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:04,440
Speaker 6:  A comedy nerd. But yeah, I, this speaks to

624
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:08,720
Speaker 6:  Disney's larger plan for things. It's like we need to become a part of like

625
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,600
Speaker 6:  their emotional dna so that yeah everyone has an into

626
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,000
Speaker 6:  Disney like that is sort of the galaxy brain brilliance of Disney,

627
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,000
Speaker 6:  right? It's like we live inside you, you can't get away from

628
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,800
Speaker 6:  right and you are going to pay us to feel good about our existence. Don't

629
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,840
Speaker 6:  question it. And so with that in mind, like Disney plus sort of that

630
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,800
Speaker 6:  is sort of like the, the underlay trick of Disney plus. I think

631
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,520
Speaker 6:  you'd be hard pressed to find people who are completely outside of that,

632
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,200
Speaker 6:  which is sort of what they're banking on. But you're right. Like there isn't

633
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,840
Speaker 6:  a lot, at least here in the US right? There isn't a lot on Disney Plus that

634
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,480
Speaker 6:  would necessarily appeal to Disney adults and you know

635
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,640
Speaker 6:  those a few step from proper Disney adult status.

636
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:53,960
Speaker 5:  Wait, hold on. This is the generation gap here is real. I encourage

637
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,440
Speaker 5:  you all to live with a small child. Disney Plus is on in our house

638
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,400
Speaker 5:  every single day. Well

639
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,000
Speaker 2:  Yeah cuz you got

640
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,680
Speaker 5:  A kid, right? I'm just saying like between Bluey and Encanto. Yeah.

641
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:07,560
Speaker 5:  Like that's what we pay the money. I do the math almost every day of

642
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,520
Speaker 5:  like, could I buy this archive and just have it versus

643
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,040
Speaker 5:  paying the money a month and Disney because it's like three things

644
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:19,040
Speaker 5:  and there's a promise there will be more things. The

645
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,840
Speaker 5:  math is, I should just say subscribe to

646
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:20,960
Speaker 6:  It

647
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,280
Speaker 5:  Because we get, we are just, it's just on constantly

648
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,960
Speaker 5:  everywhere we are. It's like how do we get half an hour of, of

649
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,360
Speaker 5:  peace in our lives? It's just like a little bit more encanto.

650
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:36,360
Speaker 6:  I can still listen to the Encanto soundtrack and not like reflexively

651
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:40,320
Speaker 6:  flinch at it because I've heard it so many times. Like Bluey,

652
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,480
Speaker 6:  I am a blue fan, I'll put it on every now and then. It's just like, you know

653
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,640
Speaker 6:  what, what are those Australian kids up to? Let's find out. And it's not,

654
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,320
Speaker 6:  I'm, I'm not bluey poisoned yet and that's kind of what,

655
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:54,560
Speaker 6:  that's why I wanna I Disney plus like you dip in every now and then get what

656
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,440
Speaker 6:  you need. You dip back out, go on with your life. But no, I totally get from,

657
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,360
Speaker 6:  if you have children in your life, I can totally see like the value add to

658
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,240
Speaker 6:  having Disney plus in your life. Like

659
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,880
Speaker 2:  When you come out of the, you know the baby's born and they give you your

660
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,880
Speaker 2:  baby, do they also just give you a Disney plus?

661
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,960
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah. The hospitals are gonna start, the hospitals do this already with

662
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,760
Speaker 5:  like brands of formula and like they like yeah like having a baby's a fully

663
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,920
Speaker 5:  monetized experience at some point Bob Iger is gonna realize

664
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,840
Speaker 5:  that the three month Disney plus subscription is gonna convert in every hospital

665
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,760
Speaker 5:  for the rest of time.

666
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:29,440
Speaker 6:  The first way you know you're pregnant is your cvs. Your CVS

667
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,680
Speaker 6:  just prints out a

668
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,920
Speaker 5:  Subscription the data brokers announced and like suddenly you're subscribed

669
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,760
Speaker 5:  to to D plus. That's great. That's the future of all ad based

670
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,480
Speaker 5:  track. What's more interesting to me is those Disney adults, right? Like

671
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,040
Speaker 5:  because people with kids, they all hear about Bluey. Bluey is like a viral

672
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,280
Speaker 5:  phenomenon. Like it's not a marketed show. No. Right? It's just, it's a phenomenon

673
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,880
Speaker 5:  because people are like, I can watch this with my kids and I don't hate myself

674
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:57,640
Speaker 5:  ka you putting that out there, but it's the Disney

675
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:01,320
Speaker 5:  adults and I feel like man, Disney just believes that

676
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,280
Speaker 5:  we'll watch like anything like, yeah I watched Moon Night and I

677
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,120
Speaker 5:  was like this is insulting. Like the whole show is like

678
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,760
Speaker 5:  just fully insulting to me that you think this is worth my time.

679
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:15,600
Speaker 6:  You didn't like the show about the latino slash kind of English

680
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,520
Speaker 6:  man who becomes an avatar of justice wrapped up

681
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,720
Speaker 6:  in Egyptian mythology.

682
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:24,200
Speaker 5:  That's a show where it's like Disney assumed I would like the concept

683
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:28,400
Speaker 5:  and the fact that it was a marvel and that there would be an infinite variety

684
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,000
Speaker 5:  of SEO targeted webpages about the backstory,

685
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,880
Speaker 5:  the character and not care at all about

686
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,640
Speaker 5:  the actual show that was on my television, which had a CGI

687
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,440
Speaker 5:  budget of $5, right? And I was like, I'm watching this. I'm like, everything

688
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,320
Speaker 5:  about me is primed to, I love Oscar Isaac. Yeah. Everything about me

689
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,200
Speaker 5:  is primed to love this show. And I, I wanted to go away like

690
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,280
Speaker 5:  I think you should start over was basically my reaction to this. And I think

691
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,600
Speaker 5:  that's, that's just true of a lot of Marvel stuff lately and I think that's

692
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,360
Speaker 5:  actually a bigger problem than Disney wants to admit.

693
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:03,160
Speaker 6:  I think that we're, what we, krantz and I talk about this a lot cuz you know,

694
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,120
Speaker 6:  we're those people, but I think that what we have sort of part of

695
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:11,040
Speaker 6:  the ugh is phase four a flop with Marvel. I think that part of what

696
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,800
Speaker 6:  people are picking up on are shifts within the studio, right? Shifts within

697
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,680
Speaker 6:  the budgeting, right? We are seeing, we are all very familiar with what

698
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,600
Speaker 6:  a production that involves volumes looks like these days. And we have our

699
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,120
Speaker 6:  feelings about them. A lot of people, I think the volumes are a big part

700
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,720
Speaker 6:  of Moon Night and that was a big part of what made everything feel so

701
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,000
Speaker 6:  music video, because it's not cheap, it's not that, it's not that they look

702
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,920
Speaker 6:  cheap, they do look very expensive. Expensive isn't the word. They look like

703
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,840
Speaker 6:  the presence of money is involved, right? But,

704
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:44,720
Speaker 6:  but it's not necessarily leading towards something that feels

705
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:49,200
Speaker 6:  polished despite it feeling shiny. And I think that yes, from

706
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,120
Speaker 6:  Marble's perspective, there are financial reasons as to why it

707
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:57,040
Speaker 6:  makes sense to work that way, right? When you are just looking at the

708
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,160
Speaker 6:  list of productions that are going on, you have to keep them under a certain

709
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,080
Speaker 6:  kind of budget. Particularly for these projects that live on Disney Plus.

710
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:07,880
Speaker 6:  We are at a point right now where when we are seeing a significant part of

711
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,440
Speaker 6:  the franchise existing in episodic format, right? Even though the Netflix

712
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,360
Speaker 6:  shows were sort of a big deal when they first launched Disney slash Marble

713
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,280
Speaker 6:  didn't get really serious, serious about tv, sorry, agents of Sheel

714
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,000
Speaker 6:  until Disney Plus existed, right? Yeah. I mean putting out shows

715
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,960
Speaker 6:  that were directly meant to feed into the movies in a significant kind of

716
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,600
Speaker 6:  way and, but

717
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,960
Speaker 5:  Then they didn't. But even even this, I feel like I did all this homework

718
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:35,600
Speaker 5:  about the multiverse and then it just didn't matter

719
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,240
Speaker 5:  in that movie.

720
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:39,520
Speaker 6:  I think that there was a lot of planning that went into it, but I don't think

721
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,640
Speaker 6:  that the execution has been all that great. I think that what we are seeing

722
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:46,320
Speaker 6:  is one of the biggest corporations in the world trying something out and

723
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,040
Speaker 6:  not entirely sticking the landing despite the fact that their inordinate

724
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,360
Speaker 6:  amount of resources should have made it impossible for them to mess it up

725
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,400
Speaker 6:  quite like this.

726
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:58,600
Speaker 5:  It literally feels like watching Wanda vision was now homework that I did

727
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,960
Speaker 5:  not need to do. There was like entertaining homework side reading that was

728
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,320
Speaker 5:  not important for any reason.

729
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:07,560
Speaker 2:  It just feels a lot like comics. Like if you're in the comics

730
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,000
Speaker 2:  space right now, then you're like, oh no, there's a big crossover. I gotta

731
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,640
Speaker 2:  go pick up like Captain Marvel from three years ago,

732
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:18,600
Speaker 2:  number 12 and read that. So I know what I'm gonna be expecting. And

733
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,680
Speaker 2:  that's a lot of work

734
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:23,600
Speaker 6:  And in a, it's weird to say, but like the M C U became

735
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,560
Speaker 6:  comic bookie in phase four, which is both a positive and a negative. Do

736
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,120
Speaker 6:  you want ridiculous stories that don't exactly make much sense and sort of

737
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,040
Speaker 6:  don't and don't gel with the character motivations that have

738
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,440
Speaker 6:  clearly been outlined in this recent story by a different creative team?

739
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,960
Speaker 6:  Then here you go. Like that's just comics in a nutshell. And it rubs movie

740
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,320
Speaker 6:  goers the wrong way because we have been, you know, we've been taught to

741
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,760
Speaker 6:  expect not that,

742
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,040
Speaker 5:  And especially by Marvel, right? Which, which successfully shed

743
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:54,320
Speaker 5:  some of that baggage in translating the comics to the screen. And so

744
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,120
Speaker 5:  the M C U is different and is focused and you understand what Robert

745
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:02,000
Speaker 5:  Downey Jr is gonna do. He's got a couple of moves, they're great, they're

746
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,880
Speaker 5:  the best moves, honestly. And like we're gonna deliver those moves

747
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,800
Speaker 5:  to you in an escalating series of conflicts until we kill him,

748
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:14,040
Speaker 5:  right? And like that's great. And now they're just like all over the, and

749
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,960
Speaker 5:  I, the reason I bring this up is to some extent the entire strategy for

750
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,280
Speaker 5:  Disney Plus is you are gonna want more Marvel stuff.

751
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,560
Speaker 5:  You're gonna want more Star Wars stuff. You're just want these franchises

752
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:29,400
Speaker 5:  to get milked until they're dry and then you gotta make 'em crazy. That's

753
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,080
Speaker 5:  their monopoly strategy beyond your kids are gonna watch Encanto

754
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,920
Speaker 5:  three times a week, but, and that's fine like grades I, but like

755
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,520
Speaker 5:  there's not a lot of rewatch potential inside the

756
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,960
Speaker 5:  Spider-Man movies or whatever, right? Like they're, they're just like missing

757
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,920
Speaker 5:  something now where they're just getting crazier and crazier and it

758
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,040
Speaker 5:  seems like the Marvel audience, the big danger here is the Marvel audience

759
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:53,280
Speaker 5:  is like, is this one gonna be worth it?

760
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,240
Speaker 6:  Right? And I think that that's kind of, that is the unfortunate reality

761
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,600
Speaker 6:  of where it is right now. Like it's interesting to think of what other alternatives

762
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:04,400
Speaker 6:  a studio could have gone for. Is it all right? Well now that Thanos has gone,

763
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,960
Speaker 6:  things have to just get bigger and more cosmic and more

764
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,120
Speaker 6:  ridiculous. Is it that, or is just, let's just start over, right? Like let's

765
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,360
Speaker 6:  just start over with a different group of people who exist in this world

766
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,240
Speaker 6:  and the fact that the studio didn't decide to go on that direction or rather

767
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,160
Speaker 6:  has only just started to kind of do it with the thunderbolts

768
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,160
Speaker 6:  and they're sort of like, like let's just sort of, and I'm not sure that

769
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,360
Speaker 6:  raising the stakes was the right move for something that is

770
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:32,280
Speaker 6:  presumably meant to exist in perpetuity, right? Like

771
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,200
Speaker 6:  comic books are created with the assumption that the stu like the

772
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,800
Speaker 6:  stories are just gonna keep going long enough that it won't matter when stories

773
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,840
Speaker 6:  come back around and you sort of see the cyclical nature of the business.

774
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:47,040
Speaker 6:  But movies have never worked that way, right? Sequels always have to

775
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,880
Speaker 6:  be bigger and more expensive and better. And unfortunately

776
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:55,080
Speaker 6:  Disney slash Marvel have not sort of recognized that they

777
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,480
Speaker 6:  are in a position to encourage their audiences not to think that way.

778
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:02,920
Speaker 6:  They have sort of fed into the expectation that you are always going to get

779
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,600
Speaker 6:  sort of like a more spectacular product. And in doing so, it's kind of work

780
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:10,240
Speaker 6:  themselves into this weird corner where it's like, well how do we, how

781
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,280
Speaker 6:  do we keep making these things bigger and better? I'm not really sure that

782
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:13,560
Speaker 6:  you can,

783
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,240
Speaker 2:  Well it's like they, they haven't, they haven't acknowledged that basically

784
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,120
Speaker 2:  they're doing soap operas but with fancier colors and no, they just

785
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:24,040
Speaker 2:  need to embrace like the whole story mechanism that soap

786
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,960
Speaker 2:  operas figured out in the sixties. But we gotta, we gotta, we gotta vote

787
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,560
Speaker 2:  like Disney plus go 90 scale, where is it right now?

788
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:32,000
Speaker 5:  Disney Plus or Disney?

789
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,840
Speaker 2:  Disney Plus. We're just talking about Disney Plus, which is where the Marvel

790
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,440
Speaker 2:  lives, which is where Bluey

791
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,120
Speaker 5:  Disney Plus is. Zero. It's a zero ER's back they got

792
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,560
Speaker 5:  Bluey. Yeah, right. Like you know, you don't know what to watch. Avengers

793
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,680
Speaker 5:  end game is right there. It'll burn three hours. Zero.

794
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:50,640
Speaker 2:  All right, so zero. Unless with an asterisks, if they get rid of Bluey

795
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,160
Speaker 2:  and then it's like a five,

796
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,000
Speaker 5:  If they get rid of Bluey it's a 90, I'm just like, they're dead to me. Get

797
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,920
Speaker 5:  outta here. Hulu I think is like an 85. I think the future

798
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,640
Speaker 5:  of Hulu is, is deeply up for grabs and it, but I will also say this,

799
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:07,520
Speaker 5:  Hulu has been at 85 since the first day Hulu existed. Yeah, this is

800
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,480
Speaker 5:  an improbable product.

801
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:09,880
Speaker 6:  The weird Franken service,

802
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,400
Speaker 2:  Charles, where's your Disney plus? Your Disney Plus is at a zero.

803
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,480
Speaker 6:  There's always a little bit of fatalism in me, so like no one is safe, but

804
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,080
Speaker 6:  like I think that they're at like a solid 15. Wait,

805
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,480
Speaker 5:  You gave Netflix a two when you're giving Disney plus a 15?

806
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:26,280
Speaker 6:  I'm going to stick with what I said because I said it and I'm not gonna

807
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,080
Speaker 6:  backtrack just cuz I was challenged on it, but I do, I do think that

808
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:33,840
Speaker 6:  there is a, just because Disney Plus is a newer service, I am

809
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:37,720
Speaker 6:  still waiting to sort of see Disney Plus prove what its thing

810
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,360
Speaker 6:  is aside from, hey, we got the Disney content,

811
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:41,320
Speaker 2:  We got the babies,

812
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:44,800
Speaker 6:  We got the babies, and we got the Star Wars nerds. And I get that that's,

813
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,200
Speaker 6:  you know, that is a successful business strategy, but it doesn't light me

814
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,800
Speaker 6:  up. So in my mind I'm like, mm, I don't know. You better watch out. All

815
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,400
Speaker 2:  Right, before we get to Hulu, quick, quick break to talk about

816
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:59,000
Speaker 2:  Amazon Prime. It's still there. You are still

817
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,520
Speaker 2:  required to have it if you get Amazon Prime

818
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:06,920
Speaker 2:  for shipping. It is technically, I think larger now than Netflix

819
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,240
Speaker 2:  simply because everybody gets Amazon Prime for shipping.

820
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,840
Speaker 5:  Can I just say that I love that the signature show of Jeff

821
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:17,680
Speaker 5:  Bezos's streaming network is the boys. It's just, it's like

822
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,560
Speaker 5:  it's perfect.

823
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,600
Speaker 6:  Isn't that wild?

824
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:23,840
Speaker 5:  It's so good that like when you're like Jeff Bezos, what is your biggest

825
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,760
Speaker 5:  hit in streaming? It's like the boys, the show

826
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,520
Speaker 5:  about billionaires and super, super superheroes who are actually ev like

827
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,200
Speaker 5:  first of all the boys is great and it's amazing that Amazon just lets them

828
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,040
Speaker 5:  run with that show. Like I think it's great. I mean if you haven't seen it,

829
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,240
Speaker 5:  you should go watch it. It is a great show and it's so funny to think about,

830
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:46,000
Speaker 5:  there are so many scenes of that show where I stop and just start laughing

831
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:49,800
Speaker 5:  and thinking about Jeff Bezos watching the scene, that scene

832
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:53,280
Speaker 5:  and being like, all right. And he's like, well this is what I paid for,

833
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:59,160
Speaker 2:  But this wasn't supposed to be his big series, right? Like this wasn't supposed

834
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,800
Speaker 2:  to be the big landmark series of Amazon Prime. It was supposed to be the

835
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,200
Speaker 2:  one that just came out this year. The Rings of Power, which

836
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:10,240
Speaker 2:  I finished watching everybody else in my group watch

837
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:14,240
Speaker 2:  tapped out after like episode five. They couldn't go any further.

838
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:18,400
Speaker 6:  The rings of power was, it was, it was interesting the three, three

839
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,080
Speaker 6:  episodes that I made it through, but it's kind of like, it is

840
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:26,200
Speaker 6:  the danger in chasing these kinds of established IP that are

841
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,960
Speaker 6:  very big and very popular, but have been so thoroughly mined already

842
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:34,000
Speaker 6:  that the question becomes what is not just the point,

843
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,960
Speaker 6:  but sort of like, what is the ad here? What is the ad for me, an

844
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,720
Speaker 6:  average consumer who is not a dye in the wool fan of these things. I think

845
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,320
Speaker 6:  that it's really interesting to look at how the streamers are gunning for

846
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:49,000
Speaker 6:  fandom and sort of like hoping that they are able to

847
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,920
Speaker 6:  tap into not just a specific fandoms interest in a thing, but a

848
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,760
Speaker 6:  fandoms desire to promote that thing and sort of spread its message

849
00:48:56,890 --> 00:49:00,200
Speaker 6:  to other listeners. And I think that that was definitely a part of the logic

850
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:04,160
Speaker 6:  behind chasing the Lord of the Rings estate. Yeah. And hounding them

851
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,760
Speaker 6:  down for chunks of the ip but not the great chunks of the IP

852
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:11,480
Speaker 6:  to Amazon's credit. Like they put the story together, it's solid.

853
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:15,280
Speaker 6:  The cast is great. Yeah. Love the world building. But it's, it's also

854
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,080
Speaker 6:  just, this was obviously meant to be Amazon Prime's, game of

855
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,560
Speaker 6:  Thrones and that kind of logic just never, I don't think it ever translates

856
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:26,280
Speaker 6:  well. I think that once you as a consumer can like sniff out that kind of

857
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,640
Speaker 6:  logic from the studio's perspective, you're immediately kind of like, I'm

858
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,160
Speaker 6:  not, I'm not hot on it.

859
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:35,400
Speaker 5:  Also, everyone knows what happens. I just want to like, you can't

860
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,320
Speaker 5:  be like, this is our Game of Thrones. Also, everyone knows what happens has

861
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:42,560
Speaker 5:  since they were a teenager and have for 50 years,

862
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,760
Speaker 5:  right? Like there's, there's something broken with that calculus.

863
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:50,600
Speaker 5:  Whereas Game of Thrones had no one knows what happens,

864
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,400
Speaker 5:  including the guy who has not yet finished the books

865
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,680
Speaker 5:  and then they failed to stick the landing cuz he was like, I know some shit

866
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,400
Speaker 5:  happens. Like here's the, like the outline of it and they were like,

867
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,920
Speaker 5:  we're done with this. Like just get it done.

868
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:07,680
Speaker 6:  I think we can all agree that in the end, the House of the Dragon did emerge

869
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,640
Speaker 6:  as like the more this the stickier sword and

870
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,840
Speaker 6:  sorcery show that came out this year as opposed to the rings of power. And

871
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:18,600
Speaker 6:  I think it does sort of speak to not just that Game of Thrones

872
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,400
Speaker 6:  still sort of, despite the fact that a crash in Be the End still sort of

873
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,560
Speaker 6:  has like a, people still have a lot of fondness for it. I think it does just

874
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,640
Speaker 6:  sort of speak to what you're talking about. There is a degree to which this

875
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:33,040
Speaker 6:  IP has not been so thoroughly mined both with projects and in people's own

876
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,880
Speaker 6:  free time, that there was still like a curiosity there. Whereas with

877
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,120
Speaker 6:  Lord of the Rings, the fandom four Lord of the Rings, the hardcore fans,

878
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:40,880
Speaker 6:  they've read these books.

879
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:44,600
Speaker 5:  They were f I said 50 years, 70 years. They were 50 years old when

880
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:46,240
Speaker 5:  I read them as a teenager.

881
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:51,200
Speaker 6:  And so it's, it's like, well what could Amazon have done that would've made

882
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,160
Speaker 6:  it a success? I don't know. Right? Like, I'm not exactly sure that there

883
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,680
Speaker 6:  is a way that you take this and turn it into something that's going to be

884
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,440
Speaker 6:  a phenomenon just because it has already existed in the public consciousness

885
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,840
Speaker 6:  like this for so, so long.

886
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:07,000
Speaker 5:  We should talk about the other part of Amazon. So they've got like the Jack

887
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,760
Speaker 5:  Ryans of the world and they've got their, their little TV franchises. That's

888
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:14,000
Speaker 5:  not their economic model, right? Their economic model is, we

889
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:18,520
Speaker 5:  give you this, when you subscribe to Prime, you are much more likely to stand

890
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:22,040
Speaker 5:  for Prime or we need reasons for you to want this so you become a Prime

891
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,080
Speaker 5:  subscriber and then all the other benefits of Prime make it hard for you

892
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,960
Speaker 5:  to leave. Like, right. Amazon's business model for this service is

893
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,480
Speaker 5:  just wildly different than Netflix or Atrium Max or whatever. And so they're

894
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,040
Speaker 5:  doing things that the other streamers basically won't do or can't do

895
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:40,080
Speaker 5:  in particular live sports, right? They bought this gigantic

896
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:44,160
Speaker 5:  NFL package. If you wanna watch football on a Thursday, you have to go to

897
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,360
Speaker 5:  Amazon. How's that working out for you? Nii? It's, it's

898
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,840
Speaker 5:  hilariously fine. Like I, I'll just complain about this cuz this is the Vercast

899
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:54,720
Speaker 5:  and it's me, but they spent all of the money, they're very proud

900
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:58,960
Speaker 5:  of having spent all of the money to do 4K football broadcasts

901
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:03,080
Speaker 5:  and then they are still not doing 4K football. Like there's just something

902
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,920
Speaker 5:  about sports in America where it's like, even when we spend all the money

903
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:10,640
Speaker 5:  and go and get the trade press around our first in the

904
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,000
Speaker 5:  industry end-to-end 4K broadcast workflow, it's not gonna do it. They're

905
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,840
Speaker 5:  like, we're gonna go with 10 80 this year. Brutal seven

906
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,120
Speaker 5:  20. I, but it's, it's fine. They're able to do it because they're like, look,

907
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,680
Speaker 5:  football fans wanna watch their team. It's a guarantee that they're gonna

908
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,880
Speaker 5:  get irritated into paying for Prime. This is what every football fan has

909
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,680
Speaker 5:  ever said, just let it I, let me watch the game wherever I am, they're gonna

910
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,920
Speaker 5:  pay for it and then they're gonna get Prime and then they're gonna get music

911
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,320
Speaker 5:  and then like their Alexa will work better and then the shipping will be

912
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,720
Speaker 5:  free and whatever bundle of prime things you care about will happen to you

913
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:42,640
Speaker 5:  and then you'll stay. Right? And so they're able to front investments into

914
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:46,600
Speaker 5:  things that basically no one else can do. And Charles, I wonder like

915
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,640
Speaker 5:  we've talked a lot about just sort of how the business affects the content

916
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:52,840
Speaker 5:  and the context of hbo, Netflix. I'm wondering if you see any differences

917
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:56,600
Speaker 5:  with Amazon there because that's the, I would also put them at a, at like

918
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,920
Speaker 5:  a zero on the go, 90 scale. They're not going anywhere because their business

919
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,280
Speaker 5:  is a subsidy and is subsidized.

920
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,400
Speaker 6:  Right? And it's such a, it's, it's weird to think about it this way, but

921
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,560
Speaker 6:  in my mind, just because I've been covering these things for so long, Amazon

922
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:12,680
Speaker 6:  Prime rather Amazon's Studios is still a side project for Amazon in

923
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:16,480
Speaker 6:  my mind, right? Like even though that is an entire, like, that is an entire

924
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,280
Speaker 6:  beat unto itself. And obviously Amazon has proven itself to be a strong

925
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:24,040
Speaker 6:  contender in this space just by dent of the volume of content they put out.

926
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:27,960
Speaker 6:  It's not what, you know, it is not the company's sole reason

927
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,280
Speaker 6:  for existence. And in being that sort of like

928
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:35,520
Speaker 6:  side hustle from Amazon's perspective, it does sort of ensure that

929
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,920
Speaker 6:  it's not always going to exist, but there's no reason for them to get rid

930
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:42,880
Speaker 6:  of it. Right? It's not, and it's proven itself to be a successful

931
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,600
Speaker 6:  sort of business strategy for them in a way that I am.

932
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:50,640
Speaker 6:  I think that's part of why you do see, I, I'm thinking in my head right now,

933
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,360
Speaker 6:  like Disney Plus is trying to do like, Hey, do you wanna buy these things

934
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:57,000
Speaker 6:  from us? And it's such a, it's such an odd sort of pivot for them. Like,

935
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,280
Speaker 6:  Hey, we're opening up a shop to a limited number of our subscribers where

936
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,800
Speaker 6:  you can buy Star Wars paraphernalia. And it's like, that's cute. And I'm

937
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,720
Speaker 6:  sure you know, they'll get a few hundred, few thousand maybe sales out of

938
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:11,560
Speaker 6:  that. But it does sort of just feel like a pale comparison to the structure

939
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:15,400
Speaker 6:  of H B O Max, which is just like, hey, while you're watching the boys also

940
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,880
Speaker 6:  get on Amazon and buy the comics, sorry, on

941
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,480
Speaker 6:  Amazon, right? Like buy the comics, buy the Funko pops, buy all of these

942
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,400
Speaker 6:  things, send us more data points to know which characters you like

943
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,400
Speaker 6:  on this show so that we just, you know, like, you know what I mean? It just

944
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,880
Speaker 6:  sort of all seems that the thing that's happening at Disney Plus does sort

945
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,560
Speaker 6:  of feel informed by Amazon's ability to collect all of this information,

946
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,520
Speaker 6:  but it's something that the other studios aren't in a position to really

947
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,840
Speaker 6:  replicate, I don't think. It's not something that any of them can sort of

948
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:46,600
Speaker 6:  reverse engineer, at least not at this point in a way that would make financial

949
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,360
Speaker 6:  sense for them. And I think that that is definitely something that is

950
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:54,120
Speaker 6:  always going to keep Amazon on these. Like it's, it's gonna keep

951
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,120
Speaker 6:  Amazon in this space.

952
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:58,000
Speaker 5:  All right, so I'm at go 90 zero. Are you at zero two?

953
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:02,000
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Nothing like, nothing has heard Amazon in a way that would

954
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,560
Speaker 6:  ever make me think like, oh, Amazon Studios is probably

955
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:08,600
Speaker 2:  Amazon Prime is going to exist forever. As long

956
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:12,280
Speaker 2:  as Amazon exists, you're gonna be able to get this,

957
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:15,000
Speaker 2:  will the content be good? Who can say,

958
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:19,160
Speaker 5:  Yeah, by the way, we just had Steve Boom who runs Amazon music,

959
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,680
Speaker 5:  actually he just got promoted to run even more things in Amazon, but Steve

960
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,200
Speaker 5:  Boom was just on decoder and he was like, here are the three things people

961
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,880
Speaker 5:  get out of Amazon. Prime shipping, prime video, distant

962
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,680
Speaker 5:  third music. Like it's, they're the two things. It's the, it's the shipping

963
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:36,600
Speaker 5:  and the video that are the point of Amazon Prime right now. Everything

964
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,680
Speaker 5:  else in the bundle is like Mathed out, but those are the top two and that

965
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,600
Speaker 5:  means I think it's safe forever.

966
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:44,640
Speaker 2:  That's fair. All right, now we're gonna talk about the really unsafe

967
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:48,280
Speaker 2:  one, which is Hulu because the big thing here

968
00:55:48,290 --> 00:55:51,960
Speaker 2:  is is Hulu's jointly owned by Disney and

969
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:53,400
Speaker 2:  Comcast. Right Now

970
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:56,800
Speaker 5:  We need to disclose that Comcast is minority investor in Vox Media parent

971
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,440
Speaker 5:  company. I assure you if you're listening to this, they don't like us very

972
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,760
Speaker 5:  much, but there's your disclosure.

973
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:06,320
Speaker 2:  But the, basically this contract is kind of ending next year,

974
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,000
Speaker 2:  right?

975
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:10,480
Speaker 6:  So this is a holdover from

976
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:15,200
Speaker 6:  Disney's 2019 acquisition of Fox. Fox

977
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:19,040
Speaker 6:  owned a third of Hulu along with Comcast and Disney. And rather than

978
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:23,000
Speaker 6:  buying Fox's portion of Disney because to say, I forget exactly how

979
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,600
Speaker 6:  much Disney bought Fox four, they left those rights to

980
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,920
Speaker 6:  exist with Comcast because bringing them all on at once would've just been

981
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,240
Speaker 6:  too expensive. The deal at the time was, hey look, you can keep this third

982
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:37,200
Speaker 6:  of Hulu, but in 2024 you're gonna sell it back to us for

983
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,680
Speaker 6:  a price that we agree on now. Like we're gonna set this price, this is just

984
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:44,520
Speaker 6:  the minimum 2024 comes around, we're gonna renegotiate this.

985
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,880
Speaker 6:  The deadline to follow through on this deal is coming up and it's coming

986
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,680
Speaker 6:  at a time when the streaming landscape is just different, right?

987
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:56,320
Speaker 6:  Disney is all in on Disney Plus and

988
00:56:56,570 --> 00:57:00,280
Speaker 6:  it wants to sink as much money as it can into just buffing out Disney

989
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:04,080
Speaker 6:  plus spending the money to buy back those rights from Comcast.

990
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:08,240
Speaker 6:  It could, it definitely could. It doesn't necessarily want to because it's

991
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,360
Speaker 6:  just a level of spend that all of the streamers universally are sort of like

992
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:15,200
Speaker 6:  trying to like cut down on if they're going to be spending millions of dollars,

993
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,280
Speaker 6:  it better be on themselves rather than just buying out something else. Also,

994
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:22,160
Speaker 6:  just in buying Hulu, what Disney gets out of it isn't immediately clear to

995
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,880
Speaker 6:  me. Obviously they would get access to some of the content on

996
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:29,680
Speaker 6:  Hulu, but then does that get folded into Disney Plus? It's not exactly clear

997
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,440
Speaker 6:  what kind of Well,

998
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,640
Speaker 5:  So, but they're kind of doing it.

999
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,240
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I was, I mean probably same thing you were gonna say, but a lot of

1000
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:38,000
Speaker 2:  that content is already folded into Disney Plus in other markets. It's just

1001
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,640
Speaker 2:  in the United States where it's split off and when, when Disney Plus was

1002
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:45,440
Speaker 2:  launched, they said, okay, Disney plus is for the kitties and the

1003
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,600
Speaker 2:  Star Wars people and the Disney adults, and then

1004
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:53,120
Speaker 2:  Hulu is for normal people and that's gonna be where all

1005
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:56,960
Speaker 2:  of our FX stuff goes and that's where all of our adult stuff is gonna

1006
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,240
Speaker 2:  go. And they, they've kind of kept that branding, but we've seen both Capic

1007
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,440
Speaker 2:  and Iger be like, eh, do we need those two separate

1008
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:07,680
Speaker 2:  platforms and, and be a lot more hesitant on that. And then we've also had

1009
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,600
Speaker 2:  Comcast say, yeah, actually we wanna own this whole platform and, and,

1010
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:15,400
Speaker 2:  and just do that because our business is going to die soon and all

1011
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,080
Speaker 2:  we're gonna, we're gonna be in the internet business and that's about it.

1012
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:22,120
Speaker 2:  And we need some sort of TV revenue stream and we're really good, really

1013
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:26,040
Speaker 2:  good at it. I'm using air quotes here so we, we want it so that we

1014
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:29,720
Speaker 2:  can be playing in this space that everybody else is playing in the streaming

1015
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:33,480
Speaker 2:  space. So you've got these like two companies who are both pretty

1016
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:37,080
Speaker 2:  invested and have good reasons to own it, who are gonna have to fight in

1017
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,240
Speaker 2:  2023 over it.

1018
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:42,320
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And I fundamentally, it's, they both want to use it. They want to kill

1019
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,960
Speaker 5:  it to bolster their other products, right? Comcast wants to bolster

1020
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:49,840
Speaker 5:  Peacock and Disney wants to obviously bolster Disney Plus. And

1021
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:53,640
Speaker 5:  it's funny because Hulu itself is a good product that

1022
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:57,520
Speaker 5:  it's customers like its owners have always hated it. And this has

1023
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,160
Speaker 5:  been the dynamic since it is Exi, like since the first day that it is,

1024
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:05,160
Speaker 5:  it is successful despite the fact that it's ownership has actively been

1025
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,760
Speaker 5:  trying to kill it since its inception. Originally

1026
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:10,760
Speaker 2:  It was like just this little upstart and you're like, oh, you wanna watch

1027
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:14,560
Speaker 2:  TV live? We figured out a way to do it, use Hulu. And then all the TV

1028
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:18,480
Speaker 2:  companies were like, wait, that's our content. We're just gonna buy you

1029
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:22,280
Speaker 2:  all together and own you so that you become our official streamer.

1030
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,560
Speaker 2:  Because remember ABC go,

1031
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:27,520
Speaker 5:  Do you remember when every Disney brand was on a the go.com subdomain for

1032
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,320
Speaker 5:  some a completely unclear reason.

1033
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:32,880
Speaker 2:  Yeah, absolutely. Brutal. So, so Hulu is, is facing

1034
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:36,520
Speaker 2:  a space, but it's also like it's winning awards. As you noted earlier, the

1035
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:40,280
Speaker 2:  dropout cleaned up pretty reasonably at the Emmy's.

1036
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:43,640
Speaker 2:  Amanda Siegfried run won for the dropout.

1037
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,440
Speaker 2:  Elizabeth Holmes lost and is now in jail

1038
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:48,320
Speaker 2:  for 11 years.

1039
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:52,360
Speaker 5:  Yeah, I mean look, Hulu is fine. It has some good stuff. It is another one

1040
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:55,840
Speaker 5:  of those sort of default players. It has a good live TV bundle. Yeah. People

1041
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,520
Speaker 5:  like it. If you know there, there's a handful of them out in the market.

1042
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:02,320
Speaker 5:  YouTube TV and Hulu seem to be the leaders. It exists. Like

1043
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:05,960
Speaker 5:  there's a conviction to Hulu that is shocking

1044
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:10,040
Speaker 5:  given its ownership. And I think that's just a success. I would say

1045
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,960
Speaker 5:  that a year from now when one of these, one of the

1046
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:17,720
Speaker 5:  two owners has eaten it, it's gone. Hmm. And that will actually, it will

1047
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:18,920
Speaker 5:  be in some ways a tragedy.

1048
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:22,960
Speaker 6:  I mean, it is gonna come down to who is willing to either

1049
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,920
Speaker 6:  spend slash forego the cash, right? Like that is gonna be the thing that

1050
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:30,440
Speaker 6:  determines Hulu's future. And I genuinely don't feel that anything that's

1051
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:34,000
Speaker 6:  going on at Hulu is going to keep it from being destroyed.

1052
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,840
Speaker 6:  Unfortunately, just because everyone who has a financial interest in it does

1053
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:41,480
Speaker 6:  stand to gain something either by its acquisition or destruction.

1054
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:43,640
Speaker 6:  So they won't just leave it to exist.

1055
01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:47,320
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's funny cuz we're basically predicting it's going away, but it's

1056
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:51,200
Speaker 5:  the, as I look at the list, well Apple TV plus is on this list in

1057
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:55,080
Speaker 5:  South anymore. But as you look at the list, right, the list here is

1058
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:59,000
Speaker 5:  like, so Netflix, hbo, Disney, Amazon, Hulu, those

1059
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,680
Speaker 5:  are the ones where you, you don't feel bad about recommending that anyone

1060
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:04,800
Speaker 5:  pay money for them, right? You're gonna get your money back out of those

1061
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:07,800
Speaker 5:  subscriptions in one way or the other. You're gonna be entertained, the apps

1062
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:11,680
Speaker 5:  aren't gonna crash on you. You know, it it, there's just something

1063
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:15,560
Speaker 5:  solid about these ones we're about to turn the corner into.

1064
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:19,480
Speaker 5:  Ugh, maybe there's one show you want, right? And

1065
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:23,240
Speaker 5:  it's funny that the, the Hulu is the last one to talk about cuz it is the

1066
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:27,000
Speaker 5:  one that is Yep. It's the one you can feel safe recommending.

1067
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,080
Speaker 5:  It's also the one that is definitely gonna go away. Right? And this is the,

1068
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:34,040
Speaker 5:  this is the corner that's turning where the business models of these and

1069
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:37,920
Speaker 5:  the ownership structures of these companies are more determinant of

1070
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,840
Speaker 5:  their futures than the content or the quality of the content. So, okay,

1071
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,480
Speaker 5:  go 90 scale for Hulu. I'm putting it solidly at

1072
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:44,680
Speaker 2:  80

1073
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,320
Speaker 5:  80. It's, it's done for

1074
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:46,880
Speaker 2:  Charles.

1075
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:51,160
Speaker 6:  Yeah. 80 feels right, especially because like, because the deadline

1076
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:54,880
Speaker 6:  is coming up and I don't think that it would benefit either side to just

1077
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,040
Speaker 6:  not move on it. Like they can't just ignore the deadline and be like, we're

1078
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:01,880
Speaker 6:  just gonna pretend that we never had those conversations. They

1079
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,040
Speaker 6:  are gonna, they are, they are gonna move on it and it's probably gonna lead

1080
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:08,000
Speaker 6:  to Hulu's destruction unfortunately. So, hey,

1081
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:11,640
Speaker 2:  I'm putting it at 85 just to be contrarian.

1082
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:14,400
Speaker 2:  I think it's even closer to death cuz Comcast is gonna

1083
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,960
Speaker 5:  Buy it at and t buys it.

1084
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:17,440
Speaker 7:  No.

1085
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:21,640
Speaker 2:  Okay, we're gonna take one more break and then we're gonna come back and

1086
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:25,560
Speaker 2:  we'll get into Peacock Paramount Plus and my personal favorite, the Taylor

1112
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:08,050
Speaker 2:  personal favorite. Peacock. Peacock exists.

1113
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:12,850
Speaker 2:  If you wanna watch Yellowstone, you have to subscribe to Peacock.

1114
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:14,290
Speaker 5:  The number of emails I get

1115
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:15,050
Speaker 8:  About Yellowstone,

1116
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:18,570
Speaker 2:  This new show with Carla Gugino, you have to subscribe. That's all I know

1117
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:19,130
Speaker 2:  about Peacock.

1118
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,970
Speaker 5:  I've, so we have started watching Yellowstone because everyone has recommended

1119
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:26,730
Speaker 5:  it to us. It's good. It's one of those shows that is, you know, it's like

1120
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:29,890
Speaker 5:  the water, it's everywhere, but no one talks about it except once you,

1121
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:33,130
Speaker 5:  once you tell the algorithms of the internet that you are mildly interested

1122
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:35,970
Speaker 5:  in Yellowstone. Everyone's talking about it. Hmm. First season, the great

1123
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:39,370
Speaker 5:  Second Season's little, it's just, it's one of the, like, they're doing the

1124
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:42,810
Speaker 5:  thing where they keep escalating the stakes and so it's just,

1125
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:46,530
Speaker 5:  it's just getting sillier. But that's fine. It's well acted. It's great.

1126
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:50,450
Speaker 5:  I get why people are into it. It's succession on horses.

1127
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,370
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You can't say no

1128
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:54,210
Speaker 2:  Sometimes there's guns.

1129
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:58,410
Speaker 5:  Yeah. The number of characters that are introduced on the show merely

1130
01:04:58,410 --> 01:05:01,850
Speaker 5:  so that they can be murdered. Like ever. This,

1131
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:05,770
Speaker 5:  it's, we could do a whole hour on it. It's so funny. Like people talk about

1132
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:09,610
Speaker 5:  how beautifully written it is and there are some banger lines in every

1133
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:13,210
Speaker 5:  episode and then there's just some like, oh, our, our

1134
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:17,010
Speaker 5:  character murders, people need some more people to murder. Here's some people,

1135
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:20,200
Speaker 5:  people that are gonna show up to get murdered. Like it's just like nakedly

1136
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,720
Speaker 5:  happening. Like, oh, these people are gonna die. So it, it has its moments

1137
01:05:23,810 --> 01:05:27,720
Speaker 5:  in the way that a big swirling soap opera has its moments. Okay. But it's

1138
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:31,080
Speaker 5:  also found an audience for Peacock for Paramount Plus, right? Like

1139
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:34,360
Speaker 5:  Paramount Plus is fully invested in this universe. They're doing

1140
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:38,720
Speaker 5:  prequels after prequels, they're bringing in star talent.

1141
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,080
Speaker 2:  1923 is coming,

1142
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:44,880
Speaker 5:  Right? And then they're gonna do 1883. Like they're going back in time

1143
01:05:45,330 --> 01:05:49,320
Speaker 5:  in a like a hilarious way. The Stars all want to work with Taylor Sheridan.

1144
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:53,280
Speaker 5:  Like they've built a, a Marvel franchise out of

1145
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:56,760
Speaker 5:  a ranch in Montana and it's sort of like under remarked upon,

1146
01:05:56,950 --> 01:06:00,800
Speaker 5:  except now everyone is, they're realizing like, oh, the money is here. Yeah.

1147
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:03,600
Speaker 5:  And you might be able to stand up an entire streaming network

1148
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:08,160
Speaker 5:  full of the Paramount Library on the back of this franchise.

1149
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:11,280
Speaker 5:  That's, by the way, Taylor Sheridan like, writes and directs every episode

1150
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:15,080
Speaker 5:  himself. Their bet is that he won't keel over and die. But

1151
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,840
Speaker 5:  that's like it, that's, that's what they got. They got that and then like

1152
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:21,400
Speaker 5:  everyone just bought Top Gun Maverick. So like, they didn't even like get

1153
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:25,320
Speaker 5:  the window of Top Gun. There's not a lot else there.

1154
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:28,160
Speaker 5:  And I'm, I'm, and I'm bundling Paramount and Peacock together.

1155
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,280
Speaker 2:  You're bundling them together.

1156
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:32,880
Speaker 5:  Well just because the thing that's driving peacock right now is

1157
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:33,960
Speaker 5:  Yellowstone, right.

1158
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:37,680
Speaker 2:  Because Paramount Plus didn't think about it at the time when they were,

1159
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,240
Speaker 2:  when they were like, we need to sell the streaming rights and instead of

1160
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,280
Speaker 2:  keeping it on Paramount Yeah, right. Peacock, you can have the streaming

1161
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,640
Speaker 2:  rights to this, it'll be fine. And they're, they're now like, we have a lot

1162
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:50,240
Speaker 2:  of regret. We asked Peacock if we could have the rights back and Peacock

1163
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:50,680
Speaker 2:  was like,

1164
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:54,840
Speaker 5:  No, no. It's the only reason people subscribe to Peacock. Peacock straight

1165
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:58,600
Speaker 5:  up. So I would say Peacock to me is, is at the most honest

1166
01:06:59,070 --> 01:07:02,760
Speaker 5:  80 of them all. Yes. Like it's straight up. It's,

1167
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:06,840
Speaker 5:  it's the Comcast NBC disclosure, Comcast is always, it

1168
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:10,760
Speaker 5:  doesn't have hits. They wanted the hit to be the Olympics trying to figure

1169
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:14,480
Speaker 5:  out that company's approach to streaming the Olympics. Like that was the

1170
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:18,440
Speaker 5:  most honest, how to watch SEO, target bait that we've ever done. You know,

1171
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:21,920
Speaker 5:  like cuz it was hard, it was like legitimate. Like this is a good

1172
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:26,040
Speaker 5:  service to our audience to be like, how do I do this? Because

1173
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:29,000
Speaker 5:  they're so complicated. They haven't gotten the 4K stuff on sports right.

1174
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,680
Speaker 5:  At all. Yeah. And then the rest of it is what used to be

1175
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,880
Speaker 5:  Netflix's sort of like sleepy time binge watch stuff like The

1176
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,600
Speaker 5:  Office, right? Right. And they thought that bringing the office would bring

1177
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:42,440
Speaker 5:  all that audience over and it turns out Netflix would be like, Nope, you

1178
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:46,320
Speaker 5:  want a nap while you watch stuff. We have infinity content for comfort napping

1179
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:50,240
Speaker 5:  to be to happen. So I just think like they've gotta make a huge

1180
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:54,160
Speaker 5:  change to Peacock and maybe it means going away and buying all

1181
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,440
Speaker 5:  of Hulu and leaning into Hulu.

1182
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:59,200
Speaker 2:  Peacock's gonna be a channel on Max and Amazon

1183
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,680
Speaker 2:  Prime. I think that's what happens.

1184
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:03,720
Speaker 5:  Oh, just like one of those, like you subscribe to it within a larger bundle.

1185
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:04,240
Speaker 5:  Yeah,

1186
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,800
Speaker 2:  I think, I think a hundred percent that's what happens to it. But

1187
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,320
Speaker 5:  Why wouldn't you just do that with nbc?

1188
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:09,800
Speaker 2:  Because it's called Peacock Neil.

1189
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:13,520
Speaker 5:  This is what I mean. Like, I, I this brand isn't worth anything to anyone.

1190
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:16,840
Speaker 5:  Like Yeah, you buy Hulu and you, you like run it as Hulu and you like merge

1191
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:20,760
Speaker 5:  everything together or you sell NBC or your constituent

1192
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:24,520
Speaker 5:  like famous good brands Yeah. As channels into the bigger services.

1193
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:28,480
Speaker 5:  There's no reason to try to build up a thing called Peacock your

1194
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,920
Speaker 5:  desire to have a product like this.

1195
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,320
Speaker 2:  Right. Like they just, it was like, I wanna be a part of this as well moment

1196
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:37,200
Speaker 2:  for them. And I think you're right that like it's an 80, it's, it

1197
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,920
Speaker 2:  doesn't last much longer. What about you

1198
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:41,960
Speaker 6:  Charles? I'm gonna put it at a 79.

1199
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:46,480
Speaker 6:  Right? For one reason. One reason. And it's not, it's not just

1200
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:50,040
Speaker 6:  the contrarian. I'm legitimately excited to see what poker face is about

1201
01:08:50,110 --> 01:08:53,880
Speaker 6:  Ryan Johnson and Natasha Leone's thing that's coming out where she's a non

1202
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:57,920
Speaker 6:  paranormal detective who can somehow always tell when people are lying. Like

1203
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,680
Speaker 6:  it's like, it's silly premise. The trail looked great and I'm like, peacock,

1204
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:04,480
Speaker 6:  why? Unfortunately you should have like been leading with stuff like this.

1205
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:08,440
Speaker 6:  You know, the the Gritty Fresh Prince reboot was not exactly going to

1206
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:11,040
Speaker 6:  make me sign up for a new service. And then the show wasn't particularly

1207
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,600
Speaker 6:  good. And so I thought to myself, oh, peacock's no one to pay attention to,

1208
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:17,400
Speaker 6:  but then just happened to casually see this and it's like, oh, like that

1209
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:21,240
Speaker 6:  looks interesting. Is it enough to save a

1210
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:25,080
Speaker 6:  streamer? No. Yeah. Could it? Yes it could. It could.

1211
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:29,040
Speaker 6:  It could. And so that's why I'm putting it at a 79 because

1212
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,720
Speaker 6:  maybe that will be the thing. Maybe it will be

1213
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:31,720
Speaker 5:  One show.

1214
01:09:31,970 --> 01:09:35,760
Speaker 6:  It will be their Game of Thrones and their orange is a new black and

1215
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,040
Speaker 6:  they're transparent all rolled into one and everyone

1216
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:41,640
Speaker 2:  Ted lasso everything at once. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. Let's talk about

1217
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:45,480
Speaker 2:  Paramount Plus because that's, that's the other kind of weird

1218
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:48,200
Speaker 2:  wonky service started by a terrestrial TV show.

1219
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:51,520
Speaker 5:  I'm telling you. Paramount plus Yellowstone Universe,

1220
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:55,400
Speaker 5:  red America. Yeah, they're, that thing is solid. Like they've got a

1221
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:58,400
Speaker 5:  franchise that they can build on. They've gotta do all the rest of this stuff.

1222
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:02,120
Speaker 2:  They've got multiple franchises. They've got, they've got the, the Avatar

1223
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:06,000
Speaker 2:  franchise from Nickelodeon, they've got all of the Star

1224
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,840
Speaker 2:  Trek. A lot of it's just been like nostalgia bait, which is lazy but I'll

1225
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:10,480
Speaker 2:  watch it. People

1226
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:11,320
Speaker 6:  Like lower decks.

1227
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:14,600
Speaker 2:  Yeah, people like lower Decks, people like the one with Anson Mount, it seems

1228
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:18,560
Speaker 2:  to be popular. And then Halo came out. I know a lot

1229
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,760
Speaker 2:  of people found it pretty forgettable. I'm still tuning in for season two.

1230
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:25,360
Speaker 5:  Here's what, okay, so here's the argument for it not being under

1231
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:29,000
Speaker 5:  45. Okay? For Right Under 45 is more alive than dead, right? Yeah.

1232
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,560
Speaker 5:  The argument for More Dead than Live 45 and over on the

1233
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:37,520
Speaker 5:  go 90 scale of Dune streaming services. The thing that we invented makes

1234
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:41,440
Speaker 5:  no sense, but the argument that it's more dead than Alive is we are in

1235
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:45,400
Speaker 5:  the honeymoon phase of a just launch streaming service that

1236
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:49,160
Speaker 5:  has a couple of hits and the money and the attention and the vibes are good

1237
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:52,800
Speaker 5:  and there's no the the underlying corporate structure,

1238
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:55,640
Speaker 2:  But Paramount Plus is not just launched.

1239
01:10:55,870 --> 01:10:59,080
Speaker 5:  Well it kind of did. Right? But it didn't like

1240
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:02,960
Speaker 2:  It. It was a rebranding of CBS All Access, which started

1241
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:06,880
Speaker 2:  almost immediately after Hulu because CBS said we don't wanna be

1242
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,040
Speaker 2:  a part of Hulu, we want our own thing.

1243
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:12,280
Speaker 5:  Sure. But CBS All Access was like not a huge hit. What I'm saying is Yeah,

1244
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:15,760
Speaker 5:  paramount Plus is the, the new home of the

1245
01:11:15,790 --> 01:11:19,560
Speaker 5:  merged CBS Viacom corporate entity. Yeah.

1246
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:20,960
Speaker 5:  Which did not exist before,

1247
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,440
Speaker 2:  Which did not. Yeah, that's true.

1248
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:26,400
Speaker 5:  Right. So they rebrand, they took the CBS all access tech platform and they

1249
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:30,160
Speaker 5:  rebranded it Paramount Plus after CBS and Viacom merged, by the way, this,

1250
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:33,960
Speaker 5:  if you want succession, like the actual history of CBS and Viacom and the

1251
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:37,760
Speaker 5:  Redstone, like it's crazy. The Redstone family is nuts, but they now the

1252
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:41,160
Speaker 5:  company, it's one merged company. They've got all the brands and they are

1253
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:45,120
Speaker 5:  in that honeymoon period of new leadership, new company, new

1254
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:48,880
Speaker 5:  product with some big hits. There's nothing aside from that

1255
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:52,760
Speaker 5:  that tells you, oh, these vibes will continue. Right? There's not an

1256
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:56,560
Speaker 5:  enormous business model success underlying it. There's not a

1257
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:00,440
Speaker 5:  history of technology innovation here from

1258
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:01,720
Speaker 5:  this company in particular.

1259
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:05,400
Speaker 2:  I don't think it's history of tech innovation, but I do think like we cannot

1260
01:12:05,710 --> 01:12:09,280
Speaker 2:  ignore the fact that CBS for decades has been

1261
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:12,880
Speaker 2:  very, very good at finding what people wanna watch and getting

1262
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:16,640
Speaker 2:  it in front of them. Like CBS dominated,

1263
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:20,360
Speaker 6:  We denigrate like the the ncis. Yeah. You know, of the world.

1264
01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:24,160
Speaker 6:  But they are successful franchises that have been on since Time and

1265
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:28,040
Speaker 6:  Morum because people want to watch them. And us talking about the

1266
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:31,120
Speaker 6:  fact that people are still watching Big Bang Theory on h b Om Max. I think

1267
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:34,880
Speaker 6:  that CBS is definitely in a position to leverage its terrestrial

1268
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:39,240
Speaker 6:  audience on two Paramount plus they have not demonstrated

1269
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:43,440
Speaker 6:  any sort of plan or ability to do so. Yet they are

1270
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,480
Speaker 6:  still so new into their existence at Yeah,

1271
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:48,880
Speaker 2:  No, no. I'd argue that this Yellowstone thing is their plan, right? Because

1272
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,880
Speaker 2:  most of the people who are originally watching Yellowstone are watching it

1273
01:12:52,170 --> 01:12:56,120
Speaker 2:  on Paramount tv, a terrestrial, like a cable

1274
01:12:56,120 --> 01:13:00,000
Speaker 2:  channel or they're maybe watching it on Peacock to catch up and then

1275
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,280
Speaker 2:  they're saying, okay, you watched that, you liked that. Now do you wanna

1276
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:07,160
Speaker 2:  watch this thing where Harrison Ford plays Kevin Costner's, I

1277
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:11,080
Speaker 2:  think great uncle in the 1920s and Helen Miens there

1278
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:15,040
Speaker 2:  in Irish come right. Watch that. And so like that's, that's what they're

1279
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,800
Speaker 2:  doing is they're trying, they're trying to do kind of what Netflix originally

1280
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:21,360
Speaker 2:  did, which is say you like these characters, you like this stuff,

1281
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:25,120
Speaker 2:  you are scared of streaming because you live in rural

1282
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,920
Speaker 2:  Colorado. I'm thinking of just like one specific friend of mine come

1283
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:33,600
Speaker 2:  spend your $4 you and it's just like watching regular

1284
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:37,560
Speaker 2:  tv. You still get your commercials, spend your $4 and now you get

1285
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:41,440
Speaker 2:  to watch this premium show with Helen, me and and Harrison Ford

1286
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:45,440
Speaker 2:  and like I like, I think we all kind of discount them because it's

1287
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:49,200
Speaker 2:  cbs, it's Paramount. Like it's the people who gave us N C I S and the

1288
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:52,160
Speaker 2:  Chicago series. But at the same time those things are

1289
01:13:52,590 --> 01:13:56,160
Speaker 2:  hugely, hugely popular. A lot of people watch it

1290
01:13:56,300 --> 01:14:00,080
Speaker 2:  and I think that's gonna continue to be the case for Paramount Plus. I'm

1291
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,200
Speaker 2:  really curious to see what their subscription numbers are like.

1292
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,840
Speaker 5:  All right, I'm putting them at 45 after this conversation. I'm putting 'em

1293
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:04,920
Speaker 5:  at

1294
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:08,280
Speaker 2:  45. I'm putting 'em at like 32. Okay. It's a fun number.

1295
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:12,400
Speaker 6:  I would still put them at like a 55 because it does it again. Like

1296
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,280
Speaker 6:  if they are not able to really sort of get it together and figure out

1297
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:19,600
Speaker 6:  how to convert that old school audience into

1298
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:22,760
Speaker 6:  subscribers, then yeah, paramount Plus is gonna be in a really rough position.

1299
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:26,480
Speaker 6:  But if they are able to make it seem like the easiest and

1300
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:30,280
Speaker 6:  sort of most familiar service for their fans to sort of glom onto,

1301
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:31,920
Speaker 6:  yeah, it will be around.

1302
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:35,520
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I think 1923 is gonna be a big deal for them or at least a big

1303
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:39,000
Speaker 2:  change for them one way or the other. All right, now we're gonna talk about

1304
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:43,200
Speaker 2:  Apple TV plus no Ted Lasso this year, but

1305
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:47,160
Speaker 2:  Severance Severance was huge for them. The Major League Soccer

1306
01:14:47,330 --> 01:14:51,160
Speaker 2:  finally launching there. Nobody watches it cuz it's Major League

1307
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:51,480
Speaker 2:  Soccer

1308
01:14:52,510 --> 01:14:53,000
Speaker 5:  Rael,

1309
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:54,240
Speaker 2:  But it's a sport.

1310
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,880
Speaker 5:  David Pierce is so mad at you,

1311
01:14:55,970 --> 01:14:59,560
Speaker 2:  He can't be here. Play with your baby David. Enjoy your adorable baby.

1312
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:03,080
Speaker 2:  But you know, they, they they're getting Oscars, they're, they're winning

1313
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:06,600
Speaker 2:  Emmy's. This is kind of the, a lot of people have said this is the new H

1314
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:07,480
Speaker 2:  B O who

1315
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:08,240
Speaker 6:  Has said that? Who?

1316
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:11,960
Speaker 5:  Apples says that Eddie Q is walking around me. Like it's the new

1317
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:12,480
Speaker 5:  Inviro.

1318
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,440
Speaker 6:  Let's be specific about who's saying this.

1319
01:15:15,450 --> 01:15:18,080
Speaker 5:  No, so they, they have a really high bar. One thing if you open the Apple

1320
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:21,800
Speaker 5:  TV app, there's a lot of stuff in there now. Yeah, right. They just

1321
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,040
Speaker 5:  licensed like all the Will Ferrell movies for a while because they've got

1322
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:28,360
Speaker 5:  the new Ryan Reynolds Will Ferrell movie. Like I was like, is this weird?

1323
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:32,200
Speaker 5:  Like I'm watching old school in Apple TV plus right now,

1324
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:36,000
Speaker 5:  like this doesn't make any sense, but they're starting to like

1325
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,920
Speaker 5:  fill out the catalog in these like little spurts. Yeah.

1326
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:43,520
Speaker 5:  So you're like, oh, Apple's got all the Will Ferrell movies. That's fun.

1327
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,520
Speaker 5:  I'll like watch a bunch of those and then they're gonna go away. They're

1328
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:49,000
Speaker 5:  gonna do it again. So they've got new programming ideas that make the app

1329
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,560
Speaker 5:  feel full even though the catalog is nowhere near as big as everyone else.

1330
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:57,400
Speaker 5:  They're making a bunch of stuff. They just, improbably made

1331
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:01,240
Speaker 5:  Three Seasons of Sea, one of the silliest shows ever made.

1332
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:05,280
Speaker 2:  They all wear masks but they can't see why do they wear the

1333
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:08,320
Speaker 5:  Masks? The number of Reddit threads are like, wait, can they see? It's like

1334
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,240
Speaker 5:  very funny on that show.

1335
01:16:10,430 --> 01:16:12,280
Speaker 6:  I feel like that's Apple School. They just like

1336
01:16:12,370 --> 01:16:16,280
Speaker 5:  Confuse a Reddit conversation into existence. They're just making

1337
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:19,640
Speaker 5:  stuff and they're, some people really like the shows, but then they only

1338
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:22,920
Speaker 5:  have had I think the two or three breakout hits.

1339
01:16:23,150 --> 01:16:26,920
Speaker 5:  Like they've made three seasons of Mythic Quests, which is a fun show to

1340
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:29,880
Speaker 5:  watch. And also the sort of show that Netflix would've definitely killed

1341
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:32,720
Speaker 5:  after the second season. Right. And Apple's like, yep, we're gonna re-up

1342
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:34,040
Speaker 5:  it cuz some people are watching it.

1343
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:37,480
Speaker 2:  Tons of critical acclaim. Everybody really, really likes Mythic Quests. I

1344
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,960
Speaker 2:  think it even got nominated, did it get nominated for Emmy's this

1345
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,720
Speaker 5:  Year? Yeah. The best part about Mythic Quests by the way, is how much it

1346
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:46,280
Speaker 5:  relentlessly dunks. It's a show about a game studio. Yeah. And the characters

1347
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:49,720
Speaker 5:  at the game studio relentlessly dunk on the concept of mobile gaming

1348
01:16:49,970 --> 01:16:53,920
Speaker 5:  at every turn. It's great. It's the funniest shit you've ever

1349
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,600
Speaker 5:  heard. Like Apple made this show

1350
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:59,160
Speaker 2:  A lot of, a lot of like game developers say it's the most realistic

1351
01:16:59,290 --> 01:17:03,280
Speaker 2:  version of their world, which horrifying you guys. Yeah. What is

1352
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:06,880
Speaker 2:  happening to your industry. But, but yeah, like outside of Severance

1353
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:10,880
Speaker 2:  and Ted Lasso, there's a lot of shows I really like on it, but I am

1354
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,120
Speaker 2:  alone. Like I don't, there's a lot of other people

1355
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,920
Speaker 5:  Watching them. We can dispense with this one quickly. Yeah. Apple's at a

1356
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,640
Speaker 5:  zero, they're, it's not going anywhere. It's part of their services strategy.

1357
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,520
Speaker 5:  It makes their bundle more valuable. It's the same situation as

1358
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:25,960
Speaker 5:  Amazon Prime. Eventually Apple's getting the place where you pay 'em a hundred

1359
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:29,160
Speaker 5:  dollars a month for your phone, your cell service

1360
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:33,640
Speaker 5:  and the bundle of Apple stuff. And then every year or two you get a

1361
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:37,040
Speaker 5:  new phone like they're headed towards just pay us a fee

1362
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:40,280
Speaker 5:  for a phone service and all the stuff that comes on the phone. Right. Every

1363
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:43,200
Speaker 5:  and that's gonna be their, their model for, and they're, that's the regular

1364
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:46,360
Speaker 5:  bird chest that we can talk about that at length. But the TV stuff, they

1365
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:50,200
Speaker 5:  know it's sticky. They love that acclaim. I think Tim Cook likes going

1366
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:53,960
Speaker 5:  to the award shows. Oh yes fine. But the

1367
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:58,000
Speaker 5:  question is they wanted to do more. Right? They wanna do

1368
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,280
Speaker 5:  sports streaming. They have done baseball, they're starting to do soccer.

1369
01:18:00,330 --> 01:18:04,160
Speaker 5:  There's all the noise about them doing football. They actually have no aptitude

1370
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:07,920
Speaker 5:  at this. Their baseball productions are laughably bad and people hate them.

1371
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:11,000
Speaker 5:  We have not yet quite seen what they're gonna do with soccer. Right. Just

1372
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,960
Speaker 5:  getting started and they've told the NFL we want more than the traditional

1373
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,760
Speaker 5:  rights cuz we wanna do something innovative and the NFL's like, we make the

1374
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:19,760
Speaker 5:  most money like

1375
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,120
Speaker 2:  Buy NFL if you want it.

1376
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:26,240
Speaker 5:  But it's interesting, right, because Apple like Amazon is right, the

1377
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:29,640
Speaker 5:  product is subsidized, but it also creates a subsidy for everything else.

1378
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:33,680
Speaker 5:  They're able to go into other parts of the ecosystem Yeah. That

1379
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:36,760
Speaker 5:  the traditional streamers like Netflix and others won't do. And so I think

1380
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:40,680
Speaker 5:  that to me, the future of Apple TV plus is whether they bring

1381
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:44,640
Speaker 5:  on live sports and live news and take over that part of the cable bundle

1382
01:18:45,030 --> 01:18:48,920
Speaker 5:  that a Netflix or a Disney plus just never will.

1383
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:52,840
Speaker 6:  That'd be interesting if they decided to pursue that because I do my

1384
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:56,600
Speaker 6:  reticence about not reticence, I just, for whatever reason, apple shows have

1385
01:18:56,780 --> 01:19:00,240
Speaker 6:  not stuck with me. And I don't think it's just because I watch so many of

1386
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:02,760
Speaker 6:  these things. It's just because there's some part of my mind that's like,

1387
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:06,520
Speaker 6:  ah, Apple's doing TV now what do you have to say? Apple? And it all feels

1388
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:09,640
Speaker 6:  like an A student going through the motions of putting out what it thinks

1389
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:13,800
Speaker 6:  of as prestige tv, but it doesn't feel Apples productions never feel

1390
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:17,480
Speaker 6:  like creative endeavors from like a corporate level that they're trying to

1391
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:21,120
Speaker 6:  share with the world. It does very much sort of feel like a

1392
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:24,680
Speaker 6:  transparent business pour, which is fine. Right? I I get it.

1393
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:28,640
Speaker 6:  But it is something that always leaves me a little bit

1394
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:32,440
Speaker 6:  cold to like a amidon. It's like I I

1395
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:35,360
Speaker 6:  I'm not exactly sure what the company could be doing differently to make

1396
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:39,000
Speaker 6:  me feel differently, but the idea of Apple

1397
01:19:39,070 --> 01:19:42,800
Speaker 6:  really pushing TV as a bonus utility

1398
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:46,200
Speaker 6:  that sort of comes along with just being a part of the Apple ecosystem does

1399
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:50,080
Speaker 6:  feel like the most prudent way to ensure its success going forward.

1400
01:19:50,110 --> 01:19:54,080
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And I, I think the question is whether they, you know, apple TV

1401
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:57,440
Speaker 5:  plus as a service is the unique Apple product

1402
01:19:57,710 --> 01:20:01,640
Speaker 5:  that is everywhere. Like you can just get it on Roku, you can just

1403
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:05,320
Speaker 5:  get it on Android TVs. Like it's strange in its way.

1404
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:09,480
Speaker 5:  And I think that's part of the underlying dynamic there is does it ever

1405
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:13,040
Speaker 5:  have to be a business or is it always this sort of

1406
01:20:13,230 --> 01:20:17,080
Speaker 5:  factor in this long mathematical equation of the lifetime value

1407
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:20,960
Speaker 5:  of an Apple customer that, you know, kind of doesn't have to justify itself

1408
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:24,880
Speaker 5:  all the way because that is really, and Apple's the richest company in the

1409
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,960
Speaker 5:  world, it's gonna somebody print money and they're gonna subsidize this thing

1410
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:30,800
Speaker 5:  forever in a day. But the question is whether the service creates

1411
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:34,680
Speaker 5:  an identity by having that sort of existential need to exist in a

1412
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:38,520
Speaker 5:  way that, you know, like Hulu has an identity because at

1413
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:41,000
Speaker 5:  every turn it has had to prove itself as a brand.

1414
01:20:41,150 --> 01:20:45,080
Speaker 2:  Well I feel like it's, it's kinda like with Amazon, I feel like when I, when

1415
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:48,600
Speaker 2:  I open up the Amazon Prime app, it's Jeff Bezos going

1416
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:52,560
Speaker 2:  enjoy your content and just flinging it at my face. And then

1417
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,960
Speaker 2:  with Apple TV it's like Tim Cook being like, Hey, would you like to sit down

1418
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:59,680
Speaker 2:  and enjoy your content? But they asked me to sit down first and it's really

1419
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:03,080
Speaker 2:  polite. So I'm I'm, I'm down for it. I'm gonna give it a 10

1420
01:21:03,190 --> 01:21:07,160
Speaker 2:  rather than a zero. Okay. Just because at some point

1421
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:11,200
Speaker 2:  I wonder if the cost is too much for, for the company.

1422
01:21:11,890 --> 01:21:15,480
Speaker 5:  No, you, you have to have an entire CEO transition.

1423
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,920
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Tim Cook cannot knife his own baby.

1424
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:21,280
Speaker 2:  Tim Cook's not gonna do it, but I'm putting it at a 10 because Tim Cook is

1425
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:21,880
Speaker 2:  gonna retire.

1426
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:25,160
Speaker 5:  You're putting in a 10 because like on a long enough timeline everyone dies.

1427
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:26,720
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Like that's your 10. That's

1428
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:30,240
Speaker 2:  My 10. I had a long enough timeline. Everyone dies and so too well Apple

1429
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:32,680
Speaker 2:  TV plus Charles, what about yourself? I

1430
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:36,560
Speaker 6:  Think they're a solid zero. It's Apple to come so late to the streaming game

1431
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:40,360
Speaker 6:  and then to be like, hello everyone, welcome to Apple TV Plus. And then for

1432
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:43,480
Speaker 6:  them to have a couple of flops and we all know it and then to, to sunset

1433
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:47,240
Speaker 6:  the service would be an embarrassment I think that the company does not

1434
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:51,280
Speaker 6:  want to have. So even though I'm saying that it's mostly

1435
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:54,320
Speaker 6:  saving face, they will keep Apple TV plus four.

1436
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:58,200
Speaker 2:  All right, so we're gonna wrap up this episode. I feel like we've learned

1437
