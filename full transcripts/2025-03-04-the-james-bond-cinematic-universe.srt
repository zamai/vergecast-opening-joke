Description: On this episode, we're diving deep into new ideas about old things. First, Framework CEO Nirav Patel joins David and The Verge's Sean Hollister to talk about Framework's new Laptop 12 and Desktop, plus the company's plan to bring its upgradeable, repairable ethos to other gadgets. After that, Daring Fireball's John Gruber joins the show to talk about the future of James Bond, now that Amazon has complete creative control over the 007 franchise. Do we want to live in the James Bond Cinematic Universe? Finally, we answer a question on the Vergecast Hotline about using smart glasses to replace your computer monitor.

2
00:00:03,225 --> 00:00:06,955
Speaker 2:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Modular Devices.

3
00:00:07,495 --> 00:00:09,995
Speaker 2:  I'm your friend David Pierce and I have like

4
00:00:10,515 --> 00:00:14,475
Speaker 2:  1,740 miles to walk. So I downloaded this

5
00:00:14,475 --> 00:00:18,315
Speaker 2:  app called Fantasy Hike, which V Song recommended on the podcast a few

6
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:21,915
Speaker 2:  weeks ago. It's basically an app that takes all of your

7
00:00:21,915 --> 00:00:25,435
Speaker 2:  motion activity, the steps you take and stuff like that and converts it to

8
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:29,395
Speaker 2:  like this long Lord of the Ring Z journey to take

9
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:33,195
Speaker 2:  a ring back to, they don't call it Mordor for copyright reasons, but that's

10
00:00:33,195 --> 00:00:37,075
Speaker 2:  the idea. The journey is 1,780 miles and it turns out I am

11
00:00:37,115 --> 00:00:40,435
Speaker 2:  surprisingly easily gamified by systems like this.

12
00:00:41,015 --> 00:00:44,675
Speaker 2:  So I have found this very compelling and I'm now walking way more than I

13
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:47,995
Speaker 2:  ever have before just so that I can get the little like way to go

14
00:00:47,995 --> 00:00:51,955
Speaker 2:  notifications and see my progress and get somewhere. So at some point I

15
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:55,915
Speaker 2:  think I'm going to end up walking almost 1800 miles all because of this

16
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:59,235
Speaker 2:  silly fake Lord of the Rings app. It's great stuff. Anyway,

17
00:01:00,065 --> 00:01:03,355
Speaker 2:  this is a super fun episode we have coming up. We're gonna do two things.

18
00:01:03,845 --> 00:01:07,675
Speaker 2:  First, Sean Hollister and I are gonna talk to Nav Patel, the CEO of

19
00:01:07,675 --> 00:01:11,395
Speaker 2:  framework about the new desktop and laptop, the company last week

20
00:01:11,795 --> 00:01:15,715
Speaker 2:  launched, plus all of this stuff that framework might

21
00:01:15,735 --> 00:01:19,035
Speaker 2:  do in the future. They have some pretty interesting ideas and we have a lot

22
00:01:19,035 --> 00:01:22,755
Speaker 2:  of questions about those ideas. Then John Gruber from Daring

23
00:01:22,755 --> 00:01:26,555
Speaker 2:  Fireball is gonna come on and talk about the thing he knows best. James

24
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:29,715
Speaker 2:  Bond. Super fun episode. We also have a really fun hotline question about

25
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:33,515
Speaker 2:  glasses on your face for computers. All of that is coming up in just

26
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:36,635
Speaker 2:  a second, but first I'm gonna be honest with you, I'm gonna go get a couple

27
00:01:36,635 --> 00:01:40,315
Speaker 2:  more miles in. I'm on my way to Mount Fire, I think it's called, which is

28
00:01:40,315 --> 00:01:44,155
Speaker 2:  not Mordor because of Lord of the Rinks. This is the verse

29
00:01:44,155 --> 00:01:45,275
Speaker 2:  cast. We'll be right back.

30
00:03:22,155 --> 00:03:25,885
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. I don't know If you know the company framework, but

31
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:29,725
Speaker 2:  for the last several years, I have thought they are one of the most interesting

32
00:03:30,045 --> 00:03:33,925
Speaker 2:  companies in tech. Basically framework's big idea is that all computers,

33
00:03:33,985 --> 00:03:37,965
Speaker 2:  all gadgets, all electronics really should be upgradeable and

34
00:03:38,015 --> 00:03:41,845
Speaker 2:  repairable that when your AirPods stop working because the battery

35
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:45,765
Speaker 2:  stops working, they shouldn't die and go into a landfill. You should be able

36
00:03:45,765 --> 00:03:49,685
Speaker 2:  to just stick in a new battery and keep moving on with your life frameworks.

37
00:03:49,685 --> 00:03:53,325
Speaker 2:  Products until now have all been laptops. There was a 13 inch laptop and

38
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:57,325
Speaker 2:  a 16 inch laptop, both of them super repairable. Like you can

39
00:03:57,395 --> 00:04:01,325
Speaker 2:  unscrew something, pull out a module, stick in a new one, screw it back in,

40
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:05,245
Speaker 2:  and you've just upgraded your computer. It's a big powerful idea

41
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:09,325
Speaker 2:  and framework has actually done a better job of pulling it off really than

42
00:04:09,345 --> 00:04:13,205
Speaker 2:  any other company I've certainly ever seen. And so last week

43
00:04:13,325 --> 00:04:17,205
Speaker 2:  when framework announced a new laptop, the framework laptop 12 and

44
00:04:17,345 --> 00:04:21,285
Speaker 2:  its first desktop ever, the framework desktop, it felt like a big moment,

45
00:04:21,285 --> 00:04:25,045
Speaker 2:  right? Like this is the time when a company like Framework is really

46
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:28,685
Speaker 2:  starting to make the case that it matters, that it can keep doing this thing

47
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:32,325
Speaker 2:  and that it can take its big idea and extend it out into other

48
00:04:32,325 --> 00:04:36,165
Speaker 2:  products. So I called up both Sean Hollister on our team

49
00:04:36,165 --> 00:04:39,645
Speaker 2:  and Nav Patel, the CEO of framework, just to dig into all of this,

50
00:04:39,865 --> 00:04:42,885
Speaker 2:  what's going on at framework, how it's been able to pull off this

51
00:04:43,645 --> 00:04:47,285
Speaker 2:  miraculous thing that no one else has in actually sticking to the

52
00:04:47,515 --> 00:04:51,445
Speaker 2:  plan of having upgradable gadgets, although it hasn't been perfect and we're

53
00:04:51,445 --> 00:04:55,165
Speaker 2:  gonna talk about that, but also what you can do with this idea

54
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:59,085
Speaker 2:  about how gadgets should work and how far it really goes. So lots

55
00:04:59,085 --> 00:05:02,885
Speaker 2:  to talk about. Let's just get into it. I kind of just wanna start with framework

56
00:05:02,905 --> 00:05:06,605
Speaker 2:  as a company because again, it's, it's been a while since you and I have

57
00:05:06,605 --> 00:05:09,845
Speaker 2:  talked, it's been a while since we've talked about framework stuff on The

58
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:13,885
Speaker 2:  Vergecast, catch us up on framework, the company a little bit. You're,

59
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:17,245
Speaker 2:  you're, yeah, kind of a hardware startup, but you're not as startup a startup

60
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:20,765
Speaker 2:  as you were. Like where, where do you feel like you are at that the moment?

61
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:24,525
Speaker 2:  I think we're not as startupy a startup. I'm gonna take that as a compliment.

62
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:27,845
Speaker 2:  Meaning I think we're, we're executing relatively smoothly and without a,

63
00:05:27,885 --> 00:05:30,565
Speaker 2:  a lot of, I think it is a compliment. Yeah, yeah. Without a lot of drama

64
00:05:30,805 --> 00:05:33,925
Speaker 2:  I think is the key, which makes it feel maybe less like a startup than than

65
00:05:33,925 --> 00:05:37,605
Speaker 2:  many other startups do. But yeah, we're five years

66
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:41,485
Speaker 2:  in, we're 60 people and whenever I say both of those numbers, people are

67
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:45,365
Speaker 2:  eyes like go wide. A bit like, wait a second, really you can do that with

68
00:05:45,365 --> 00:05:49,325
Speaker 2:  60 people. There really is just a testament to the team that we've

69
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:52,925
Speaker 2:  been able to put together. We've got just an awesome set of individuals and

70
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:56,645
Speaker 2:  we're also just carrying in a ton of collective experience,

71
00:05:56,675 --> 00:06:00,645
Speaker 2:  both from like bigger mature consumer electronics companies of like how

72
00:06:00,645 --> 00:06:04,085
Speaker 2:  to do hardware smoothly, but then also the

73
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:07,885
Speaker 2:  startups that were very startupy where we got to learn from the

74
00:06:08,085 --> 00:06:11,525
Speaker 2:  mistakes very quickly and not at least make those same mistakes again.

75
00:06:12,285 --> 00:06:15,685
Speaker 2:  I also feel like from the beginning you've been kind of

76
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:19,885
Speaker 2:  resolutely, less chaotic than a lot of hardware startups. Like Sean and I

77
00:06:19,885 --> 00:06:23,165
Speaker 2:  spent a lot of time with people who have huge ideas about revolutionizing

78
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:26,845
Speaker 2:  everything and quickly discovered that, you know,

79
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:30,725
Speaker 2:  making one of something is very different from making thousands or millions

80
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:34,005
Speaker 2:  of those things. And I feel like you were, you were pretty clear-eyed about

81
00:06:34,005 --> 00:06:37,565
Speaker 2:  that stuff from pretty early on and I think it's still like even just hearing

82
00:06:37,585 --> 00:06:40,885
Speaker 2:  you talk at the event this week about the way that you're thinking about

83
00:06:40,885 --> 00:06:44,765
Speaker 2:  products, like there's still a sort of cautious approach to all of this that

84
00:06:44,765 --> 00:06:48,325
Speaker 2:  it's like we're going to be slow and careful and not try to

85
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:50,525
Speaker 2:  move fast and break things. You

86
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:54,405
Speaker 6:  Even published in, in a manifesto, I want to say you, you earliest

87
00:06:54,725 --> 00:06:58,605
Speaker 6:  manifesto, it seems like you, you had this, this, this notion that you

88
00:06:58,605 --> 00:07:00,125
Speaker 6:  needed to be very selective.

89
00:07:00,675 --> 00:07:04,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's a, it's a move slow and fix things approach to, to

90
00:07:04,325 --> 00:07:08,245
Speaker 2:  startups I think. Which, which is, I mean it's fundamentally

91
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:11,325
Speaker 2:  we're about longevity. So if we're not building the company around longevity,

92
00:07:11,425 --> 00:07:15,005
Speaker 2:  the team around longevity, the infrastructure, how can we build the products

93
00:07:15,005 --> 00:07:17,565
Speaker 2:  themselves to be long lived? Like how can we reasonably go out there and

94
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:21,205
Speaker 2:  say we're building a laptop that's gonna last longer if we're operating as

95
00:07:21,205 --> 00:07:24,965
Speaker 2:  a company in a chaotic matter. So that's like really what

96
00:07:24,965 --> 00:07:28,685
Speaker 2:  drives very deliberately us making decisions

97
00:07:28,835 --> 00:07:31,645
Speaker 2:  that optimize for what's going to

98
00:07:32,355 --> 00:07:36,285
Speaker 2:  guarantee that 10 years from now we're still able to deliver on the same

99
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:40,205
Speaker 2:  set of promises, not what's gonna mean that we can capture the

100
00:07:40,205 --> 00:07:44,185
Speaker 2:  most hype or the most interest in the next week. So with that way of

101
00:07:44,185 --> 00:07:47,785
Speaker 2:  thinking about it, why, why the two things you launched this week, the,

102
00:07:48,045 --> 00:07:51,105
Speaker 2:  as you're, you know, you, you've had two laptops,

103
00:07:51,755 --> 00:07:55,545
Speaker 2:  those two make sense together. I would say these

104
00:07:55,565 --> 00:07:59,505
Speaker 2:  two things feel slightly further afield than the stuff that you've done before.

105
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:02,945
Speaker 2:  And I think in particular, I'm curious why do a desktop at all, but why,

106
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:05,745
Speaker 2:  why these two as the next two? Yeah, sure. I mean I think If you look at

107
00:08:05,745 --> 00:08:09,625
Speaker 2:  the framework laptop 12, that's like pretty core and pretty

108
00:08:09,805 --> 00:08:13,705
Speaker 2:  in line with the path that we've been on since day one as a company. I mean

109
00:08:13,805 --> 00:08:17,585
Speaker 2:  in some ways, like I actually have even said in the past that like if we

110
00:08:17,585 --> 00:08:21,145
Speaker 2:  had the technical capability to have done framework laptop 16

111
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:25,105
Speaker 2:  before framework, laptop 13, we might have done that in, in the sense

112
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:28,945
Speaker 2:  that like as we think about who the customer base, who the end user is for

113
00:08:28,945 --> 00:08:32,905
Speaker 2:  those products, it is actually like the more enthusiastic

114
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:36,665
Speaker 2:  earlier adopter persona that's gravitating to the 16

115
00:08:36,665 --> 00:08:40,265
Speaker 2:  than the 13. And so like as we look at the 12, like as we think about

116
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:44,425
Speaker 2:  our mission and our product philosophy, it's almost like the ultimate expression

117
00:08:44,425 --> 00:08:48,305
Speaker 2:  of that. Like we, we took, we took the category that is the most

118
00:08:48,515 --> 00:08:52,505
Speaker 2:  disposable and we wanna make it the least disposable. But

119
00:08:52,505 --> 00:08:55,965
Speaker 2:  from a brand perspective and from being able to build up the

120
00:08:55,965 --> 00:08:59,845
Speaker 2:  infrastructure and the trust to be able to go after a less

121
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:03,805
Speaker 2:  extreme enthusiast user, which is really what the target user is

122
00:09:03,805 --> 00:09:07,765
Speaker 2:  for framework Laptop 12, like that less core enthusiast more,

123
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:11,405
Speaker 2:  I want a computer that works and that's gonna last me a while. That's where

124
00:09:11,405 --> 00:09:15,245
Speaker 2:  the sequencing comes in of starting with the 13, which

125
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:18,205
Speaker 2:  we knew we could achieve. We knew we could make like a dent in the market

126
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:22,045
Speaker 2:  with that thing with a very small team very quickly. Then

127
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:25,925
Speaker 2:  building the vastly more technically complex framework, laptop 16,

128
00:09:26,345 --> 00:09:29,885
Speaker 2:  and then taking all that brand and infrastructure and team investment and

129
00:09:30,045 --> 00:09:33,885
Speaker 2:  building the product that in many ways, like technically is

130
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:37,485
Speaker 2:  actually a bit simpler by what we're doing with Framework Laptop 12.

131
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:41,125
Speaker 2:  But from a brand and a go to market perspective

132
00:09:41,985 --> 00:09:45,525
Speaker 2:  is a lot higher of a reach than the 13 of 16 were.

133
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:49,645
Speaker 6:  But you're not just keeping it simple, right? I mean I I, I see a lot of

134
00:09:49,645 --> 00:09:52,965
Speaker 6:  budget laptops out there that don't necessarily have

135
00:09:53,235 --> 00:09:57,125
Speaker 6:  touchscreen and stylus and back flipping and core I

136
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:00,725
Speaker 6:  three and I five chips. You're adding those things into the mix too, which

137
00:10:00,745 --> 00:10:03,605
Speaker 6:  I'm, I'm guessing impact the price a little bit, right? So it's not going

138
00:10:03,605 --> 00:10:07,245
Speaker 6:  to necessarily replace the most budget laptops

139
00:10:07,465 --> 00:10:10,245
Speaker 6:  out there for people. Why were those things important to get in there?

140
00:10:10,555 --> 00:10:13,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I guess like when I say simple, I think one, one key thing to call

141
00:10:13,685 --> 00:10:17,165
Speaker 2:  out on that is, I mean from an invention risk standpoint, like as we look

142
00:10:17,165 --> 00:10:21,085
Speaker 2:  at 16, like we invented a lot to make 16 work for 12,

143
00:10:21,185 --> 00:10:24,165
Speaker 2:  it was actually in many ways we took like little pieces of things that we

144
00:10:24,445 --> 00:10:28,245
Speaker 2:  invented from 13 and 16 and then brought them into 12.

145
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,205
Speaker 2:  But like as we went through the development process, I shared like little

146
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:33,965
Speaker 2:  bits and pieces of this, but I actually don't think I've shared much publicly

147
00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:37,805
Speaker 2:  yet that as we started the development process for Framework Laptop

148
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:41,765
Speaker 2:  12, like about two years ago, we actually had some like extreme and

149
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:45,405
Speaker 2:  novel designs and architectures that we were bouncing around, like things

150
00:10:45,805 --> 00:10:49,005
Speaker 2:  like reconfiguring by taking apart

151
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:53,285
Speaker 2:  modules between like clamshell and tablet and like detachable modes

152
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:56,845
Speaker 2:  and things like that, that ended up being like very inventive, ended up being

153
00:10:56,845 --> 00:10:59,605
Speaker 2:  very complex and it was like we took a step back and we looked at, we, we

154
00:10:59,605 --> 00:11:02,965
Speaker 2:  thought like, yes, we can technically do this, but is this actually the right

155
00:11:02,965 --> 00:11:06,405
Speaker 2:  thing for the type of audience we're going after? Like this is not the framework

156
00:11:06,405 --> 00:11:10,325
Speaker 2:  laptop 16 audience, like we want this thing to be simple to

157
00:11:10,325 --> 00:11:14,165
Speaker 2:  understand and simple to use. And in doing so actually

158
00:11:14,165 --> 00:11:17,965
Speaker 2:  we can then actually make it more robust and solve for, you know, some

159
00:11:17,965 --> 00:11:20,845
Speaker 2:  things like making it just generally more accessible as a product.

160
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:25,725
Speaker 2:  And so like, like all this really take kind of taking a step back to what

161
00:11:25,725 --> 00:11:28,845
Speaker 2:  makes framework a bit less startupy than many startups is that

162
00:11:29,585 --> 00:11:32,405
Speaker 2:  we make those trends, we choose those things very clearly. Like with with

163
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:36,285
Speaker 2:  you know, eyes wide open, who is this product actually for and what

164
00:11:36,285 --> 00:11:39,845
Speaker 2:  is actually sensible for that end user as opposed to what can we

165
00:11:39,845 --> 00:11:43,685
Speaker 2:  technically do as a company that builds innovative and interesting products?

166
00:11:44,185 --> 00:11:44,725
Speaker 6:  So let,

167
00:11:44,725 --> 00:11:47,125
Speaker 2:  Let's talk through that with the 12 a little more actually. 'cause I think,

168
00:11:47,545 --> 00:11:51,165
Speaker 2:  you know, you talk about the branding and marketing of it and to me it sort

169
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:54,645
Speaker 2:  of seems like the average sort of mid-range

170
00:11:54,655 --> 00:11:58,085
Speaker 2:  mainstream consumer laptop like sucks and

171
00:11:58,725 --> 00:12:01,845
Speaker 2:  I I it has become a real problem, right? Sure. That you have If you want

172
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:05,885
Speaker 2:  a pretty good Windows computer that has gotten more and more expensive over

173
00:12:05,885 --> 00:12:09,645
Speaker 2:  time. And so to some extent it seems like

174
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:13,045
Speaker 2:  you're actually perfectly positioned to come in and be like, no, actually

175
00:12:13,045 --> 00:12:16,845
Speaker 2:  what we've done is we've built a good Windows laptop and that to some

176
00:12:16,845 --> 00:12:20,685
Speaker 2:  extent, right, that should kind of sell itself in a certain way

177
00:12:20,685 --> 00:12:23,925
Speaker 2:  and like that, that makes the case for itself. So I'm curious why you feel

178
00:12:23,925 --> 00:12:27,085
Speaker 2:  like it's been, what is harder about that market than going into

179
00:12:27,755 --> 00:12:31,485
Speaker 2:  like the framework 13, which is like a market full of very good computers

180
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:34,885
Speaker 2:  Sure. And trying to make your case. Yeah, that's a good question. I mean,

181
00:12:35,065 --> 00:12:38,045
Speaker 2:  in fact, like If you look at a lot of what we do, there's a certain obviousness

182
00:12:38,045 --> 00:12:41,365
Speaker 2:  about like, Hey, why don't you just make a computer that's like kind of a

183
00:12:41,365 --> 00:12:44,925
Speaker 2:  mid-age computer that isn't terrible And you could like look at every mature

184
00:12:45,205 --> 00:12:48,085
Speaker 2:  consumer electronics brand, every mature Prese brand and ask the same question

185
00:12:48,705 --> 00:12:50,485
Speaker 2:  and the answers would be very, yeah, you think somebody would've done it

186
00:12:50,485 --> 00:12:54,085
Speaker 2:  by now, it would be very unsatisfying answers you're gonna get back.

187
00:12:55,185 --> 00:12:58,605
Speaker 2:  And like as we've observed the market very closely like the PC industry very

188
00:12:58,605 --> 00:13:01,445
Speaker 2:  closely, at least the thing that that I observe, I'm not gonna speak for

189
00:13:01,445 --> 00:13:03,925
Speaker 2:  the entire team necessarily on this specifically, is that

190
00:13:05,345 --> 00:13:09,325
Speaker 2:  the way that PC companies operate typically is that as you look across that

191
00:13:09,325 --> 00:13:13,005
Speaker 2:  entire organization for the A

192
00:13:13,035 --> 00:13:16,965
Speaker 2:  team, the best possible designers, engineers, supply chain people go to

193
00:13:16,965 --> 00:13:20,765
Speaker 2:  market people, they're all assigned to the premium top

194
00:13:20,765 --> 00:13:24,405
Speaker 2:  tier commercial notebook. So like the best and the best suppliers,

195
00:13:24,475 --> 00:13:28,125
Speaker 2:  your top tier suppliers, the best teams of the suppliers, all that goes into

196
00:13:28,435 --> 00:13:32,165
Speaker 2:  premium commercial. And then you take like the next best people

197
00:13:32,705 --> 00:13:36,445
Speaker 2:  and they get assigned to the premium consumer, so the highest on

198
00:13:36,645 --> 00:13:39,365
Speaker 2:  consumer and the next team gets assigned to like mid-tier commercial and

199
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:43,045
Speaker 2:  then like, or like, you know, sub premium commercial sub premium consumer.

200
00:13:43,585 --> 00:13:47,265
Speaker 2:  And then by the time you get down to like those like core

201
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:51,065
Speaker 2:  mainstream, mid-tier consumer laptops especially,

202
00:13:51,775 --> 00:13:55,385
Speaker 2:  it's like some guy in a basement somewhere writing a spreadsheet and throwing

203
00:13:55,385 --> 00:13:58,545
Speaker 2:  it over to a supplier and hoping to get a computer back in in a few months.

204
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:02,225
Speaker 2:  And obviously that's like, you know, an extreme exaggeration. But that, like,

205
00:14:02,225 --> 00:14:05,745
Speaker 2:  that's what I mean by the opportunity. Like I, I think I said during our

206
00:14:05,905 --> 00:14:08,505
Speaker 2:  announcement, like the opportunity that we spotted on framework laptop 12,

207
00:14:08,505 --> 00:14:11,905
Speaker 2:  like the people who need long lasting computers the most are getting like

208
00:14:11,905 --> 00:14:15,745
Speaker 2:  the most thoughtless computers and that that's like the industry dynamic

209
00:14:15,895 --> 00:14:19,105
Speaker 2:  that results in them being the thoughtless computers because obviously they're

210
00:14:19,105 --> 00:14:21,905
Speaker 2:  lower margin products. So like they're gonna, obviously these companies are

211
00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:25,225
Speaker 2:  gonna focus on premium commercial where the highest margins are

212
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:29,625
Speaker 2:  and put the least thought and care into their lowest

213
00:14:29,695 --> 00:14:32,345
Speaker 2:  cost products. For us it's that, you know, we're a small company, we've only

214
00:14:32,345 --> 00:14:35,025
Speaker 2:  got four product lines. We're gonna put thought and care into every one of

215
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:35,825
Speaker 2:  'em. There's,

216
00:14:35,825 --> 00:14:39,705
Speaker 6:  There's so much margin in the, in the premium commercial maybe, but where

217
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:43,585
Speaker 6:  is the volume in the market and is this an opportunity for you

218
00:14:43,965 --> 00:14:47,625
Speaker 6:  to get some volume? Do you have, do you anticipate you're gonna sell, you

219
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,865
Speaker 6:  know, a lot of these, do you have the capacity to make a lot of these? Is

220
00:14:50,865 --> 00:14:54,725
Speaker 6:  that the thought that there will be a lot of these twelves in the

221
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:54,925
Speaker 6:  market?

222
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:58,565
Speaker 2:  Yeah, definitely. This is, yeah, it's a very, that's a great question. It's

223
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:02,125
Speaker 2:  very much, it's a volume play, but when we say it's a volume play, it's really

224
00:15:02,165 --> 00:15:05,525
Speaker 2:  a mission play that like if we're gonna fix consumer electronics, let's go

225
00:15:05,525 --> 00:15:09,125
Speaker 2:  to the places where we can really fix consumer electronics and

226
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:09,645
Speaker 2:  we

227
00:15:11,195 --> 00:15:14,975
Speaker 2:  can live with good problems to have, like having more

228
00:15:14,975 --> 00:15:18,095
Speaker 2:  demand than we have capacity. Like we can go figure out with our suppliers

229
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:21,055
Speaker 2:  how to scale capacity. And that's where it goes back to like, we built a

230
00:15:21,055 --> 00:15:24,335
Speaker 2:  team that knows how to do this. So yeah, we've, we're very much

231
00:15:25,305 --> 00:15:29,255
Speaker 2:  going for scale with framework laptop 12, maybe even in a

232
00:15:29,255 --> 00:15:33,135
Speaker 2:  way beyond what we're doing with our other products. Interesting. So,

233
00:15:33,135 --> 00:15:36,815
Speaker 2:  and then make the, make the same case for the desktop, which I feel like

234
00:15:36,815 --> 00:15:40,415
Speaker 2:  is a very different Sure, yeah. Yeah, it's, it's a very different group of

235
00:15:40,415 --> 00:15:44,175
Speaker 2:  people. I would say it's been very funny to watch the reaction, like

236
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:48,015
Speaker 2:  even on just like the framework subreddit to the 12 and the

237
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:50,815
Speaker 2:  desktop, the 12, everybody's like, oh yeah, cool, makes sense, fine, whatever.

238
00:15:50,815 --> 00:15:53,895
Speaker 2:  Good idea. And then the desktop they're like, I have thoughts about the soldering.

239
00:15:54,565 --> 00:15:54,855
Speaker 2:  Sure.

240
00:15:56,475 --> 00:15:59,295
Speaker 2:  We also had many thoughts around the soldering. I believe that, and we're

241
00:15:59,295 --> 00:16:01,735
Speaker 2:  gonna get into those thoughts, but, but I'm curious like with that, that

242
00:16:01,735 --> 00:16:04,015
Speaker 2:  frame of reference for the 12 makes sense. What was the thinking for the

243
00:16:04,015 --> 00:16:07,815
Speaker 2:  desktop? Yeah, this is an interesting, one of the realizations we had from

244
00:16:07,845 --> 00:16:10,935
Speaker 2:  like basically a brand perspective around like what is framework, what are

245
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:13,655
Speaker 2:  we trying to do with framework, how do we bring framework to more people?

246
00:16:14,395 --> 00:16:18,015
Speaker 2:  Was this idea that, do we need to take what we're doing and

247
00:16:18,725 --> 00:16:22,535
Speaker 2:  kind of make it more accessible by diluting it, like making it

248
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:26,415
Speaker 2:  look less DIY, making it look less repairability

249
00:16:26,415 --> 00:16:30,255
Speaker 2:  upgradeability more about like, is it just like, oh these are environmentally

250
00:16:30,415 --> 00:16:33,095
Speaker 2:  friendly products. That's like kind of a mainstream statement. It's not like

251
00:16:33,095 --> 00:16:36,615
Speaker 2:  getting people into the technical details. And the conclusion we came to

252
00:16:36,635 --> 00:16:40,135
Speaker 2:  is actually that's not the right approach to get people into this world.

253
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,295
Speaker 2:  Into this world of like owning your products, using your products for longer.

254
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:46,895
Speaker 2:  The thing that we should do instead, or we could do instead is

255
00:16:47,685 --> 00:16:51,415
Speaker 2:  make repair cool, make upgradeability cool,

256
00:16:51,765 --> 00:16:55,575
Speaker 2:  make modularization and customization and personalization. Cool. Which like

257
00:16:55,575 --> 00:16:57,855
Speaker 2:  in, in many ways, like as you look at like what you're actually doing with

258
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:01,375
Speaker 2:  these, they are interesting like engaging things to do. And especially as

259
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:04,975
Speaker 2:  we look at younger audiences, people are like eager to jump into these spaces.

260
00:17:05,115 --> 00:17:08,935
Speaker 2:  And so the thing we need to do is not dumb it down and make

261
00:17:08,935 --> 00:17:12,795
Speaker 2:  it, make it look and feel like it's simpler and hide away the

262
00:17:12,795 --> 00:17:16,275
Speaker 2:  complexity. The thing we wanna do is make it fun and interesting,

263
00:17:16,615 --> 00:17:20,195
Speaker 2:  but also make it accessible. Make it accessible in a way that may be

264
00:17:20,195 --> 00:17:23,435
Speaker 2:  traditionally some of these categories or some of these behaviors haven't

265
00:17:23,435 --> 00:17:27,315
Speaker 2:  been accessible. And so the framework desktop, like a

266
00:17:27,315 --> 00:17:31,115
Speaker 2:  big part of that of course did just come straight from wow Rise and AI

267
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,755
Speaker 2:  Max is super impressive. How can we use this thing? And a big part of it

268
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:37,795
Speaker 2:  came from we like PCs, PCs are awesome,

269
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:42,355
Speaker 2:  desktop PCs are awesome, DIYing gaming rigs is awesome. Like all

270
00:17:42,355 --> 00:17:44,875
Speaker 2:  this is great. It's like a bunch of folks, including myself and the team,

271
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:48,835
Speaker 2:  have been doing it for many years. It's not the most accessible space. I

272
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:51,565
Speaker 2:  mean, I'm not saying it's like, you know, totally esoteric knowledge that

273
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:55,405
Speaker 2:  you can't get into. Obviously there are millions of us doing it, but we saw

274
00:17:55,405 --> 00:17:58,885
Speaker 2:  an opportunity for us as framework to like take that culture and take that

275
00:17:58,975 --> 00:18:02,725
Speaker 2:  ethos and open the door a bit wider by building a

276
00:18:02,885 --> 00:18:05,605
Speaker 2:  computer that is just simpler to bring into your life. Like there's less

277
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:09,405
Speaker 2:  mental overhead required and just simply this less physical space

278
00:18:09,725 --> 00:18:12,965
Speaker 2:  required to have it enter your life. But you know, we did as much as we can

279
00:18:13,345 --> 00:18:17,245
Speaker 2:  to still bring in as many aspects of that same ethos and culture around

280
00:18:17,405 --> 00:18:20,605
Speaker 2:  DIY and and PC building into it.

281
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,925
Speaker 6:  How, how is this one simpler to bring into your life

282
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:29,085
Speaker 6:  than any prebuilt desktop that comes with

283
00:18:29,085 --> 00:18:32,325
Speaker 6:  modular components in it? There, there are many of them on the market. I

284
00:18:32,325 --> 00:18:35,805
Speaker 6:  wouldn't necessarily recommend any particular company for that, but many

285
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:36,245
Speaker 6:  exist.

286
00:18:36,755 --> 00:18:39,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah, sure. I mean one, one thing that we like to do is

287
00:18:40,665 --> 00:18:44,645
Speaker 2:  go to the websites of our competitors and attempt to find

288
00:18:44,965 --> 00:18:48,525
Speaker 2:  computers, an attempt to see how are people describing their computers, what's

289
00:18:48,525 --> 00:18:52,365
Speaker 2:  the purchasing experience look like? And it is shockingly

290
00:18:52,425 --> 00:18:55,965
Speaker 2:  bad with the exception I'll say of actually Apple and maybe Microsoft.

291
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:59,805
Speaker 2:  And obviously neither of those are in the gaming PC world.

292
00:19:01,505 --> 00:19:04,205
Speaker 2:  But as you look at the, the website, or actually I'll say there are a few

293
00:19:04,205 --> 00:19:07,525
Speaker 2:  others, like NZ XT is doing great work too, but for the most part, as you

294
00:19:07,525 --> 00:19:11,005
Speaker 2:  go to like PC brand websites, especially from the big mature incumbent

295
00:19:11,445 --> 00:19:14,165
Speaker 2:  companies, it's a nightmare even figuring out what they're trying to sell,

296
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:17,485
Speaker 2:  what the product lines are available, what's new, what's old, what you should

297
00:19:17,505 --> 00:19:21,365
Speaker 2:  buy at any point in time. And so part of this is even the like figuring out

298
00:19:21,675 --> 00:19:24,765
Speaker 2:  what computer to get. And actually I think Frank did a great job, Frank Azo

299
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:27,925
Speaker 2:  when he was up on stage earlier this week kind of talking through, you don't

300
00:19:27,925 --> 00:19:31,125
Speaker 2:  really have to think about it. If you, If you want to take any game that's

301
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:35,085
Speaker 2:  out there, run it at 1440 p run at reasonable settings or the default

302
00:19:35,085 --> 00:19:37,325
Speaker 2:  settings outta the box, it's just gonna run. You don't have to think about

303
00:19:37,325 --> 00:19:41,285
Speaker 2:  like, do I have to pick out a specific configuration, make it work. And then

304
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:44,605
Speaker 2:  for us from just like a browsing and like learning about the product and

305
00:19:44,605 --> 00:19:48,445
Speaker 2:  purchasing experience aspect of it, like our marketplace team has done great

306
00:19:48,445 --> 00:19:51,965
Speaker 2:  work to actually just make it straightforward. It's not like one of the,

307
00:19:52,465 --> 00:19:56,125
Speaker 2:  you know, a hundred different weird pages of, of computers

308
00:19:56,265 --> 00:19:59,725
Speaker 2:  is the one that I'm supposed to be getting in these confusing specs that

309
00:19:59,725 --> 00:20:03,245
Speaker 2:  are there. So like we try to make it simple,

310
00:20:04,275 --> 00:20:07,765
Speaker 2:  make it transparent, like we, we lay out the very detailed specs all the

311
00:20:07,765 --> 00:20:10,965
Speaker 2:  way out to sharing like mechanical CAD of the components If you wanna get

312
00:20:10,985 --> 00:20:14,205
Speaker 2:  all the way into like the deepest complexity. But you don't have to, you

313
00:20:14,205 --> 00:20:17,965
Speaker 2:  can start from the simple page of here's the computer, here's your,

314
00:20:18,345 --> 00:20:21,805
Speaker 2:  the few most recent games you've probably heard of. Here's how fast they'll

315
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:25,605
Speaker 2:  run. Great. That sounds good. I wanna play those games. I'll get this computer.

316
00:20:25,635 --> 00:20:26,525
Speaker 2:  It's pretty straightforward.

317
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,885
Speaker 6:  I know David has more questions about the desktop than I do too, but, but,

318
00:20:29,905 --> 00:20:33,605
Speaker 6:  but the customizability to the one thing,

319
00:20:33,915 --> 00:20:36,805
Speaker 6:  when when, when you said you're bringing the learnings from the 16 and the

320
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:40,765
Speaker 6:  13 into this desktop and this laptop, I thought maybe that meant

321
00:20:40,825 --> 00:20:44,765
Speaker 6:  we would see more of the input modules and the expansion

322
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:48,525
Speaker 6:  base, the two new input mechanism, the two new modules types that you

323
00:20:48,525 --> 00:20:52,405
Speaker 6:  introduced on the framework 16. And why don't we have some

324
00:20:52,725 --> 00:20:56,365
Speaker 6:  LED panels or, or or customization or secondary screen kind of

325
00:20:56,535 --> 00:21:00,325
Speaker 6:  electronic stuff going on on the front of the desktop. Replaceable

326
00:21:00,605 --> 00:21:04,085
Speaker 6:  keyboards maybe on the 12. Tell tell us about

327
00:21:05,085 --> 00:21:08,375
Speaker 6:  what, what about those made them not a good fit for this and if we're gonna

328
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,855
Speaker 6:  see any more of those in the future. Yeah,

329
00:21:09,855 --> 00:21:12,695
Speaker 2:  This is interesting. Like, you know, you can see on the desktop for ex, well

330
00:21:12,895 --> 00:21:16,615
Speaker 2:  actually I'll say specifically on my comment on bringing learnings from 1316,

331
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:20,055
Speaker 2:  that was repairability learnings for 12. There was maybe less direct knowledge

332
00:21:20,335 --> 00:21:23,575
Speaker 2:  transfer into the desktop just 'cause the category so different architecturally.

333
00:21:24,215 --> 00:21:27,175
Speaker 2:  But we did bring in the expansion card system and it's really, as we look

334
00:21:27,175 --> 00:21:30,415
Speaker 2:  at any product we build, especially looking at framework lab 12, looking

335
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:33,815
Speaker 2:  at the desktop, we think both through

336
00:21:34,525 --> 00:21:38,455
Speaker 2:  what makes sense in our ecosystem to try to drive ecosystem expansion or

337
00:21:38,455 --> 00:21:42,015
Speaker 2:  commonality between products or being able to share modules or share share

338
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:45,695
Speaker 2:  supply chain infrastructure. But then also if we were building this product

339
00:21:45,725 --> 00:21:49,295
Speaker 2:  from a totally blank slate, what does the product experience actually need

340
00:21:49,295 --> 00:21:53,045
Speaker 2:  to be? And we end up like making sure that the end result

341
00:21:53,365 --> 00:21:56,885
Speaker 2:  actually like logically makes sense in a way that like we don't wanna force

342
00:21:56,885 --> 00:22:00,485
Speaker 2:  something that isn't gonna be natural just to get

343
00:22:00,735 --> 00:22:04,005
Speaker 2:  cross compatibility or like cross module sharing between products.

344
00:22:05,105 --> 00:22:08,685
Speaker 2:  But we also wanna leverage ecosystems where we built them out. And so basically

345
00:22:08,685 --> 00:22:12,485
Speaker 2:  as we look at the expansion card system, for example, in a world where we

346
00:22:12,485 --> 00:22:16,285
Speaker 2:  built the framework desktop first, we didn't have laptops. It's ex, it's

347
00:22:16,285 --> 00:22:20,045
Speaker 2:  very unlikely that we would've been invented an expansion card system

348
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:23,885
Speaker 2:  just to make the front IO of the desktop modularized.

349
00:22:23,955 --> 00:22:27,925
Speaker 2:  Like that's probably not something that would make sense. But we built the

350
00:22:27,925 --> 00:22:31,165
Speaker 2:  expansion card system, we already have that available. We have like, you

351
00:22:31,165 --> 00:22:34,565
Speaker 2:  know, a dozen different expansion cards out there including things like additional

352
00:22:34,565 --> 00:22:38,485
Speaker 2:  storage, additional ethernet cards, things like that. So since we had

353
00:22:38,485 --> 00:22:42,405
Speaker 2:  that in our library, we have all of that available. It made total sense

354
00:22:42,425 --> 00:22:45,965
Speaker 2:  to plug that right into the front and bring some of that, some of that customization

355
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:49,725
Speaker 2:  that's helpful in laptops to a place where it's also helpful in a

356
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:50,125
Speaker 2:  desktop.

357
00:22:50,705 --> 00:22:54,045
Speaker 6:  You, you've told me before in a prior interview that you actually plan your

358
00:22:54,045 --> 00:22:57,365
Speaker 6:  funding around this. That's right. When you get a new chunk of funding,

359
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:01,805
Speaker 6:  that chunk of funding allows you to build out a new product, which for you,

360
00:23:01,985 --> 00:23:05,485
Speaker 6:  unlike most companies, means a new product category, it means a new

361
00:23:06,035 --> 00:23:09,725
Speaker 6:  size of some kind of device. And that

362
00:23:10,145 --> 00:23:14,045
Speaker 6:  allows there to be a repairable and modular 12 inch laptop

363
00:23:14,045 --> 00:23:17,845
Speaker 6:  instead of a 13 or 16. It allows there to be a modular repairable

364
00:23:18,155 --> 00:23:21,925
Speaker 6:  desktop all of a sudden. But doesn't mean that each of those new product

365
00:23:22,215 --> 00:23:26,205
Speaker 6:  lines is going to be upgradable. We don't know that. I don't

366
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:29,605
Speaker 6:  think you've said that and I would love for you to say it here on this podcast

367
00:23:30,155 --> 00:23:33,925
Speaker 6:  with the 13. Sure. Yeah. A 2021 machine with an

368
00:23:34,005 --> 00:23:37,725
Speaker 6:  old Intel chip can now be upgraded to a 2025 standards

369
00:23:38,075 --> 00:23:42,045
Speaker 6:  with a modern A MD chip. I don't know about any company that's ever

370
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:45,125
Speaker 6:  done that before. It's amazing that you've done that. I don't know If, If

371
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:48,005
Speaker 6:  you said out loud that when you do this for other categories, that you are

372
00:23:48,005 --> 00:23:51,045
Speaker 6:  going to do that, that you are going to make them so that you can put new

373
00:23:51,045 --> 00:23:54,775
Speaker 6:  boards in them in the future and upgrade them. Is that the idea?

374
00:23:55,205 --> 00:23:58,895
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I don't know if I ever haven't said that. Not to double

375
00:23:59,175 --> 00:24:03,095
Speaker 2:  negative it, but yeah, yeah I can, I can definitely say that I can,

376
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:06,855
Speaker 2:  I can commit to, we start product lines where we have

377
00:24:07,545 --> 00:24:11,255
Speaker 2:  conviction that we'll be able to deliver on the upgradeability of it, not

378
00:24:11,255 --> 00:24:15,175
Speaker 2:  just on the longevity of it. And the challenge here of

379
00:24:15,175 --> 00:24:19,015
Speaker 2:  course is that the definition of upgradeability is really broad. And in many

380
00:24:19,015 --> 00:24:22,895
Speaker 2:  cases, because we can't be in full

381
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:26,295
Speaker 2:  control of the entire world's PC world's

382
00:24:26,635 --> 00:24:30,375
Speaker 2:  supply chains and and roadmaps, we don't want to overs specify

383
00:24:30,605 --> 00:24:34,175
Speaker 2:  what upgradeability means because that is something that's outside of our

384
00:24:34,175 --> 00:24:37,215
Speaker 2:  control. I think you'd be shocked at how often and how rapidly

385
00:24:38,295 --> 00:24:41,775
Speaker 2:  roadmaps have very large silicon companies change.

386
00:24:42,155 --> 00:24:45,695
Speaker 2:  And so we don't want to even see something that like we see on a roadmap

387
00:24:45,715 --> 00:24:49,415
Speaker 2:  and we see based on our knowledge of that item, like, oh yes,

388
00:24:49,445 --> 00:24:52,455
Speaker 2:  that could make a good upgrade for this because we don't know if a year from

389
00:24:52,455 --> 00:24:56,375
Speaker 2:  now that item will still exist. So when we state what that

390
00:24:56,375 --> 00:25:00,215
Speaker 2:  upgrade is, it's that that thing is something

391
00:25:00,215 --> 00:25:03,575
Speaker 2:  we'll be able to ship. Like we're deep enough in development, it's close

392
00:25:03,575 --> 00:25:07,415
Speaker 2:  enough to hitting well for, in our case, not a shelf, but hitting our

393
00:25:07,445 --> 00:25:11,275
Speaker 2:  website that no matter what those silicon vendors

394
00:25:11,275 --> 00:25:14,155
Speaker 2:  decide on the roadmap that thing's not gonna disappear. And we'll be able

395
00:25:14,155 --> 00:25:17,675
Speaker 2:  to get it out into the world. Going back to to the fundraising questions

396
00:25:17,745 --> 00:25:21,635
Speaker 2:  idea that we do fundraising to unlock new categories, like very

397
00:25:22,075 --> 00:25:25,955
Speaker 2:  tactically what that means is that when we raise funding like we did early

398
00:25:26,065 --> 00:25:29,555
Speaker 2:  last year, we actually go and hire and build

399
00:25:29,555 --> 00:25:33,195
Speaker 2:  additional teams within framework and we go out into our supply base and

400
00:25:33,195 --> 00:25:36,875
Speaker 2:  we make sure that they're hiring and building additional teams that are dedicated

401
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:40,755
Speaker 2:  to working with us. So every time we add another category to our

402
00:25:40,755 --> 00:25:44,475
Speaker 2:  roadmap, another long lip category to our roadmap, that's us building

403
00:25:45,035 --> 00:25:48,555
Speaker 2:  a team inside a framework that owns that product category.

404
00:25:48,975 --> 00:25:52,115
Speaker 2:  Is that in a certain way, like a really inefficient way to do business?

405
00:25:53,255 --> 00:25:56,595
Speaker 2:  One of the reasons, one of the things that makes it really efficient is that

406
00:25:57,015 --> 00:26:00,595
Speaker 2:  the same dynamic exists across other companies, other consumer

407
00:26:00,595 --> 00:26:03,515
Speaker 2:  electronics companies, but in a way that

408
00:26:04,425 --> 00:26:07,995
Speaker 2:  that product is reset either every year or every two years

409
00:26:08,185 --> 00:26:11,155
Speaker 2:  from scratch. Meaning total new set of tooling, new mechanical design, new

410
00:26:11,435 --> 00:26:15,075
Speaker 2:  electrical design, new set of modules that's like incredibly wasteful and

411
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:18,555
Speaker 2:  inefficient and obviously results in short-lived products too. 'cause how

412
00:26:18,555 --> 00:26:21,715
Speaker 2:  can you have parts longevity or upgradability if you're resetting it every

413
00:26:21,715 --> 00:26:25,475
Speaker 2:  two years? So for us, when we invest in that category that first

414
00:26:25,505 --> 00:26:29,035
Speaker 2:  year, we're paying a lot more like a, the team at our suppliers a lot bigger.

415
00:26:29,405 --> 00:26:33,275
Speaker 2:  We're paying for a lot more tooling, we're paying for new modules that

416
00:26:33,275 --> 00:26:36,955
Speaker 2:  we're tooling up and and creating. And then each time we

417
00:26:36,955 --> 00:26:40,915
Speaker 2:  refresh that product, it's more efficient for us, for our team internally,

418
00:26:41,495 --> 00:26:44,365
Speaker 2:  the teams that the suppliers are, we're working with are a bit smaller and

419
00:26:44,365 --> 00:26:47,805
Speaker 2:  more efficient and we're not doing a whole new set of tooling each time.

420
00:26:47,985 --> 00:26:51,325
Speaker 2:  So basically it costs us, let's say something on the order of

421
00:26:52,035 --> 00:26:55,805
Speaker 2:  five times more to do the first iteration of a new product

422
00:26:56,165 --> 00:27:00,085
Speaker 2:  category than it does for each subsequent refresh. Those, that's just

423
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:04,045
Speaker 2:  like a rough approximation. That's interesting. That also feels like it

424
00:27:04,065 --> 00:27:07,925
Speaker 2:  in part answers the question of of the caution and launching new things because

425
00:27:07,985 --> 00:27:11,845
Speaker 2:  that's right. That means If you get it wrong the first time, you're just

426
00:27:11,845 --> 00:27:15,165
Speaker 2:  host. Yeah, yeah. There's no way that we can recoup that, right? You spend

427
00:27:15,165 --> 00:27:17,285
Speaker 2:  a lot of money and it's just gone because you're gonna have to start over

428
00:27:17,285 --> 00:27:21,045
Speaker 2:  somewhere else. That's exactly right. So let, let's talk about where you

429
00:27:21,045 --> 00:27:24,885
Speaker 2:  go from here because I think, I think you told Sean at

430
00:27:24,885 --> 00:27:28,805
Speaker 2:  one point that you weren't just a laptop company. We're not, we've got

431
00:27:28,805 --> 00:27:31,485
Speaker 2:  a desktop now, right? I know. Does that, does that count? Like, have you

432
00:27:31,725 --> 00:27:34,445
Speaker 2:  satisfied the brief now? No, not, not really. Is

433
00:27:34,465 --> 00:27:37,365
Speaker 6:  Is that what she meant? Or, or you're going beyond PCs eventually?

434
00:27:37,545 --> 00:27:41,205
Speaker 2:  No, no. Yeah, what I meant as we're going beyond PCs and part of this, it

435
00:27:41,205 --> 00:27:44,045
Speaker 2:  goes back to the efficiency thing. It goes in some ways, even back to the

436
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:47,845
Speaker 2:  fundraising thing of like, part of what made the framework desktop really

437
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:51,325
Speaker 2:  obvious for us was that we could identify that

438
00:27:51,675 --> 00:27:55,165
Speaker 2:  mission and product philosophy and market

439
00:27:55,235 --> 00:27:59,085
Speaker 2:  opportunity for us, but we could also identify that, oh, we can leverage

440
00:27:59,395 --> 00:28:03,245
Speaker 2:  essentially all of our existing supply base and partnerships, including

441
00:28:03,245 --> 00:28:07,045
Speaker 2:  the really strong partnership we have with a MD to do this really quickly

442
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:10,405
Speaker 2:  and do this really efficiently. Whereas if we think about like a total leap

443
00:28:10,405 --> 00:28:14,125
Speaker 2:  into an entire different space, that's us building an entire new

444
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:18,005
Speaker 2:  supply base, which then demands a lot of confidence

445
00:28:18,005 --> 00:28:21,925
Speaker 2:  and a lot of investment to basically make that confidence make

446
00:28:21,925 --> 00:28:25,725
Speaker 2:  sense as you think through something like a phone, which I know

447
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:29,085
Speaker 2:  everyone has asked you about. Sure. A phone strikes me as a particularly

448
00:28:29,245 --> 00:28:33,005
Speaker 2:  interesting one because as you talk about, you know, repairability and

449
00:28:33,155 --> 00:28:34,845
Speaker 2:  e-waste and upgradeability,

450
00:28:36,395 --> 00:28:40,165
Speaker 2:  there's no place to be more effective than with a smartphone

451
00:28:40,365 --> 00:28:41,045
Speaker 2:  I think right now.

452
00:28:42,865 --> 00:28:46,445
Speaker 2:  But that's also like an incredibly mature, incredibly hard market to break.

453
00:28:46,585 --> 00:28:50,175
Speaker 2:  So like I'm not asking you to say If you're building a phone because I know

454
00:28:50,175 --> 00:28:50,455
Speaker 2:  that you are

455
00:28:52,265 --> 00:28:55,775
Speaker 2:  great, but like how, how do you think through

456
00:28:56,575 --> 00:29:00,495
Speaker 2:  a market like that one and Whether it makes sense for framework to be part

457
00:29:00,495 --> 00:29:03,295
Speaker 2:  of it? Yeah, definitely. That's a great question. I mean, one of the things

458
00:29:03,315 --> 00:29:07,015
Speaker 2:  for, for really any category that we pick goes back to this idea that that

459
00:29:07,015 --> 00:29:10,975
Speaker 2:  first iteration is such a massive investment that

460
00:29:10,995 --> 00:29:14,855
Speaker 2:  we have to be fairly sure that we're going to be able to

461
00:29:14,855 --> 00:29:18,255
Speaker 2:  succeed and win in that category. And one of the things about phones

462
00:29:18,575 --> 00:29:22,095
Speaker 2:  specifically is that that initial investment is orders of

463
00:29:22,455 --> 00:29:25,855
Speaker 2:  magnitude larger than it is for any category that we've been in to date.

464
00:29:26,275 --> 00:29:30,135
Speaker 2:  And so for us to build a phone, we have to be in a financial

465
00:29:30,295 --> 00:29:34,015
Speaker 2:  position or a fundraising position where if we're not

466
00:29:34,085 --> 00:29:37,415
Speaker 2:  able to win, obviously we wanna win, we wanna be able to to make sure that,

467
00:29:37,415 --> 00:29:40,615
Speaker 2:  that we're able to win in that category. But if the, if it winning takes

468
00:29:40,615 --> 00:29:44,245
Speaker 2:  longer than we anticipated or takes more iterations than we anticipated,

469
00:29:44,665 --> 00:29:48,485
Speaker 2:  we don't wanna put the entire company at risk around that. And so

470
00:29:48,485 --> 00:29:52,445
Speaker 2:  like, you know, obviously phones are hard from design and

471
00:29:52,685 --> 00:29:56,045
Speaker 2:  engineering perspective, especially as we think about Modularization, repairability

472
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:59,845
Speaker 2:  and Upgradeability. But they're also extremely difficult from a market

473
00:29:59,845 --> 00:30:03,365
Speaker 2:  standpoint. And so like as we look at both ends of that, we wanna make sure

474
00:30:03,365 --> 00:30:07,285
Speaker 2:  that we as a company are in a position where no matter what happens

475
00:30:07,385 --> 00:30:11,085
Speaker 2:  on phone, we're gonna continue to be able to drive and succeed on our mission

476
00:30:11,945 --> 00:30:14,325
Speaker 2:  across framework. That's when we're doing a phone

477
00:30:15,255 --> 00:30:19,195
Speaker 6:  If framework were to theoretically do a phone, what we get

478
00:30:19,495 --> 00:30:22,315
Speaker 6:  in the comments, which it's, which it is according to David Pierce. You've

479
00:30:22,315 --> 00:30:25,595
Speaker 6:  heard it here on The Verge. David Pierce, who is not part of framework believes

480
00:30:25,595 --> 00:30:26,835
Speaker 6:  frameworks. Correct.

481
00:30:29,055 --> 00:30:32,355
Speaker 6:  If, if framework were to do phone, we, we get this comment all the time on

482
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:36,355
Speaker 6:  any story where we compliment the battery of a phone or we hate

483
00:30:36,355 --> 00:30:40,155
Speaker 6:  on the battery of a phone. People say, I missed those days

484
00:30:40,425 --> 00:30:44,155
Speaker 6:  when you could open a compartment on the back of your phone and

485
00:30:44,155 --> 00:30:47,675
Speaker 6:  remove the battery and put a different battery in there. Should framework

486
00:30:47,675 --> 00:30:50,675
Speaker 6:  ever do a phone? Is that something that you think would be a feature of a

487
00:30:50,675 --> 00:30:50,795
Speaker 6:  phone?

488
00:30:51,135 --> 00:30:54,675
Speaker 2:  We do have some very interesting ideas that we, we, we have ideas around

489
00:30:54,675 --> 00:30:58,155
Speaker 2:  a lot of different categories. I do have some ideas specifically around batteries

490
00:30:58,175 --> 00:31:01,395
Speaker 2:  and phones and that I'm not gonna pre-commit anything around

491
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:06,395
Speaker 2:  given, given the unknown time in the future, at which point

492
00:31:06,395 --> 00:31:10,075
Speaker 2:  there may or may not be a framework phone. Fair enough. So, and let, let's

493
00:31:10,075 --> 00:31:13,235
Speaker 2:  go to like a talk through like a very different category. 'cause I think,

494
00:31:13,395 --> 00:31:17,355
Speaker 2:  I think about like, I don't know, headsets is is probably a

495
00:31:17,355 --> 00:31:20,835
Speaker 2:  good one right now where I think we're at a point now where there's a lot

496
00:31:20,835 --> 00:31:24,635
Speaker 2:  of energy behind it. There are a lot of people who think this is going to

497
00:31:24,635 --> 00:31:28,435
Speaker 2:  be the next big thing, but nobody has yet agreed on anything, what they're

498
00:31:28,475 --> 00:31:31,275
Speaker 2:  supposed to do, what they're gonna look like, how they're gonna work. Like

499
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:35,195
Speaker 2:  we don't know any of that yet. And so I think based on

500
00:31:35,865 --> 00:31:39,355
Speaker 2:  what you've said, that strikes me as this is a moment that is just objectively

501
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:43,195
Speaker 2:  too early for you to want to be in it. Because If you

502
00:31:43,195 --> 00:31:46,275
Speaker 2:  That's right, you just can't, you, you literally and figuratively can't afford

503
00:31:46,275 --> 00:31:49,515
Speaker 2:  to be wrong four times until we all figure this out. Is that, am I thinking

504
00:31:49,515 --> 00:31:51,955
Speaker 2:  about that the right way? That's right. Yeah. And so like as we look at like

505
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:55,835
Speaker 2:  VRAR headsets against something like laptops, the reason we did laptops to

506
00:31:55,835 --> 00:31:59,475
Speaker 2:  start our first product was a laptop, is that we saw that for,

507
00:31:59,695 --> 00:32:03,315
Speaker 2:  you know, 10 years running the use cases and the core user

508
00:32:03,315 --> 00:32:07,075
Speaker 2:  experience of laptops, it stabilized in a way that we could take

509
00:32:07,705 --> 00:32:11,675
Speaker 2:  what we had there, look at things like silicon roadmaps and module roadmaps

510
00:32:11,675 --> 00:32:15,275
Speaker 2:  from different technology providers and have fairly high confidence we could

511
00:32:15,275 --> 00:32:19,195
Speaker 2:  build a long lived upgradable product within a form factor that

512
00:32:19,195 --> 00:32:22,475
Speaker 2:  we hold constant. As we look at ar vr,

513
00:32:23,015 --> 00:32:26,515
Speaker 2:  not only are the form factors like wildly and flux, like the core

514
00:32:26,935 --> 00:32:30,795
Speaker 2:  use case and value proposition is still wide open. And those

515
00:32:30,795 --> 00:32:34,115
Speaker 2:  things, of course go very, very tightly together, especially in something

516
00:32:34,115 --> 00:32:38,035
Speaker 2:  that has such ergonomic constraints, like a, like a headset. And

517
00:32:38,035 --> 00:32:41,165
Speaker 2:  so for us to look at a VR headset and say, you know, with reasonable confidence

518
00:32:41,165 --> 00:32:44,645
Speaker 2:  that not even 10 years and five years from now that thing's still gonna make

519
00:32:44,645 --> 00:32:48,565
Speaker 2:  sense, we, we just can't do that. So it wouldn't make sense for us as

520
00:32:48,605 --> 00:32:52,565
Speaker 2:  a company with our product philosophy to go and build a VR headset and ar

521
00:32:52,565 --> 00:32:55,725
Speaker 2:  headset until that industry matures and stabilize

522
00:32:56,885 --> 00:33:00,045
Speaker 2:  stabilizes. And the interesting thing is like the way our business model

523
00:33:00,055 --> 00:33:03,565
Speaker 2:  works, we, we want that to happen and that like,

524
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:07,845
Speaker 2:  as these product categories, mature replacement cycles

525
00:33:07,855 --> 00:33:11,045
Speaker 2:  inherently lengthen, which we're even seeing in smartphones already over

526
00:33:11,045 --> 00:33:14,885
Speaker 2:  the last five years, and the companies that

527
00:33:14,885 --> 00:33:18,845
Speaker 2:  are in the space invest less in innovation

528
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:22,285
Speaker 2:  necessarily in a form factor perspective, a use case perspective because

529
00:33:22,285 --> 00:33:24,925
Speaker 2:  there's nothing, there's, you know, there's no juice left to squeeze outta

530
00:33:24,925 --> 00:33:28,805
Speaker 2:  that, outta that lemon. And instead you

531
00:33:28,905 --> 00:33:31,765
Speaker 2:  end up with this world like we're seeing maybe with iPhones today and the

532
00:33:31,765 --> 00:33:35,205
Speaker 2:  reviews that folks like you at the, at The Verge are doing on, on iPhones

533
00:33:35,205 --> 00:33:38,445
Speaker 2:  reviews of like, oh actually you can skip this year, wait for next year 'cause

534
00:33:38,445 --> 00:33:42,005
Speaker 2:  there isn't a lot worth, worth picking up this year. That's like our signal

535
00:33:42,065 --> 00:33:44,725
Speaker 2:  for like, oh, okay, we see those reviews, that means it's time for us to

536
00:33:44,725 --> 00:33:48,405
Speaker 2:  enter that product ri. So all right, we, we need to let you go here in a

537
00:33:48,405 --> 00:33:51,685
Speaker 2:  minute, but before we do, I believe Sean has a, a lightning round of things

538
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:55,685
Speaker 2:  he wants to throw at you. So I do, I am sure I I am sure I can anticipate

539
00:33:55,725 --> 00:33:56,285
Speaker 2:  a few of them.

540
00:33:57,745 --> 00:34:00,485
Speaker 6:  It, it won't have the question that I asked you the other day though. Oh,

541
00:34:00,485 --> 00:34:04,085
Speaker 6:  okay. So I've already asked it. 240 watt charger.

542
00:34:05,615 --> 00:34:09,165
Speaker 2:  We're starting to see some out in the market, which is great. It, it actually

543
00:34:09,165 --> 00:34:13,045
Speaker 2:  took much, much longer than we thought it would. We expect actually we were

544
00:34:13,045 --> 00:34:16,725
Speaker 2:  surprised that we ended up being the first 180 watt out there. We expected

545
00:34:16,865 --> 00:34:20,605
Speaker 2:  two forties to be out before we even shipped our first 180. So it's great

546
00:34:20,605 --> 00:34:23,845
Speaker 2:  to see that the market is finally like moving and catching up and

547
00:34:24,185 --> 00:34:27,445
Speaker 2:  that's nice. It's nice for everyone and obviously you can, you know, any

548
00:34:27,445 --> 00:34:31,005
Speaker 2:  of our laptops, you don't have to purchase with a power doctor, you can purchase

549
00:34:31,005 --> 00:34:33,365
Speaker 2:  it without and then pick up any anyone that you'd like

550
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:37,765
Speaker 6:  Cam memory. We know it's not going to be in the desktop because it reduced

551
00:34:37,985 --> 00:34:41,925
Speaker 6:  the bandwidth significantly to have it not be soldered on the board for that,

552
00:34:41,945 --> 00:34:45,125
Speaker 6:  for that strict halo chip. But in general we're gonna get some of that flat

553
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,845
Speaker 6:  memory in the future maybe. Yeah.

554
00:34:46,845 --> 00:34:50,045
Speaker 2:  One of the things to consider to like understand about this I think maybe

555
00:34:50,345 --> 00:34:53,365
Speaker 2:  is lost in that we have maybe haven't communicated as clearly as we needed

556
00:34:53,365 --> 00:34:57,005
Speaker 2:  to around the framework desktop, but also really around like

557
00:34:57,145 --> 00:35:00,145
Speaker 2:  any product at all, is that for

558
00:35:00,385 --> 00:35:04,025
Speaker 2:  technologies like that that go deep into signal

559
00:35:04,025 --> 00:35:07,865
Speaker 2:  integrity that go deep into IO that go deep into like even how

560
00:35:08,485 --> 00:35:12,145
Speaker 2:  the processor is packaged and the ballout works of

561
00:35:12,215 --> 00:35:16,035
Speaker 2:  signals, these are things that the silicon

562
00:35:16,135 --> 00:35:20,115
Speaker 2:  vendor has to have planned out and designed for from the start. Like us

563
00:35:20,215 --> 00:35:23,715
Speaker 2:  as a, as the end device maker, we can't like

564
00:35:23,945 --> 00:35:27,275
Speaker 2:  hack around it and like create a thing that

565
00:35:27,775 --> 00:35:31,675
Speaker 2:  wasn't designed for from the silicon to begin with. Like, so for

566
00:35:31,885 --> 00:35:35,795
Speaker 2:  let's say TAM on something like Rise in AI max, that's something that

567
00:35:35,915 --> 00:35:39,685
Speaker 2:  a MD would've needed to have designed for all the way

568
00:35:39,685 --> 00:35:42,605
Speaker 2:  from, you know, maybe, I don't even know how many years ago they started

569
00:35:42,635 --> 00:35:46,445
Speaker 2:  that, the development of the architecture and design of that thing as

570
00:35:46,525 --> 00:35:49,765
Speaker 2:  a design goal from the beginning, which actually based on our understanding

571
00:35:49,765 --> 00:35:52,965
Speaker 2:  of it may not have even been possible given how wide the memory bus on that

572
00:35:52,965 --> 00:35:55,845
Speaker 2:  thing, even if they had thought that that was the goal from the beginning.

573
00:35:56,745 --> 00:35:59,965
Speaker 2:  But there are technologies like this that just can't work. So for us it's,

574
00:36:00,685 --> 00:36:04,375
Speaker 2:  it's not can we add CAM to something that wasn't designed for cam?

575
00:36:04,565 --> 00:36:08,255
Speaker 2:  It's when is there a platform that was designed from the beginning for CAM

576
00:36:08,285 --> 00:36:10,455
Speaker 2:  that we're then gonna intercept one of our products?

577
00:36:11,305 --> 00:36:12,765
Speaker 6:  Gaming handheld,

578
00:36:14,555 --> 00:36:17,325
Speaker 2:  This isn't a an, I would put this in the category of

579
00:36:18,355 --> 00:36:19,605
Speaker 2:  similarly but differently

580
00:36:21,915 --> 00:36:25,535
Speaker 2:  mature ish, maturing ish category with good

581
00:36:25,615 --> 00:36:28,895
Speaker 2:  products that we also can't identify a clear path to

582
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:33,335
Speaker 2:  making business sense. And part of the challenge there is just

583
00:36:33,345 --> 00:36:37,255
Speaker 2:  valve is so dominant with Steam Deck, we can't afford to play the kinds of

584
00:36:37,255 --> 00:36:41,215
Speaker 2:  games that maybe a Lenovo and ASUS can likely

585
00:36:41,435 --> 00:36:45,015
Speaker 2:  not making money for an extended period of time entering a new

586
00:36:45,295 --> 00:36:48,415
Speaker 2:  category for us. Like we have to be able to recoup our investment

587
00:36:48,825 --> 00:36:52,735
Speaker 2:  relatively quickly within the first or second generation of entering

588
00:36:52,815 --> 00:36:56,375
Speaker 2:  a category. And so that's something where similar like even though like we

589
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:59,735
Speaker 2:  know we could build a great gaming handheld, we see the demand from customers

590
00:36:59,735 --> 00:37:03,575
Speaker 2:  for to have an upgradable, repairable gaming handheld, it's hard for us to

591
00:37:03,575 --> 00:37:07,535
Speaker 2:  see a path, at least right now where we can compete with valve

592
00:37:07,535 --> 00:37:09,615
Speaker 2:  in that space and not get destroyed financially

593
00:37:10,405 --> 00:37:11,935
Speaker 6:  Framework battery bank

594
00:37:12,755 --> 00:37:16,325
Speaker 2:  Framework, battery bank meaning for framework laptop 16 or for,

595
00:37:16,585 --> 00:37:18,045
Speaker 2:  for just generally as a product.

596
00:37:18,395 --> 00:37:21,845
Speaker 6:  Yeah, this is the one that would take one of your existing battery

597
00:37:21,985 --> 00:37:25,725
Speaker 6:  laptop batteries would stick it in a case. I think you showed off like a,

598
00:37:26,085 --> 00:37:28,245
Speaker 6:  A prototype of a prototype or something.

599
00:37:28,555 --> 00:37:32,125
Speaker 2:  Yeah, we, we showed a proof of concept actually two years ago at the framework

600
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:35,125
Speaker 2:  next level event. And we, we showed like there are actually a number of proof

601
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:38,965
Speaker 2:  of concepts that we showed that including an EGPU concept and part of this

602
00:37:39,025 --> 00:37:42,805
Speaker 2:  was showing and flagging to electronics

603
00:37:42,805 --> 00:37:46,565
Speaker 2:  makers, like peripheral makers especially that these things were technically

604
00:37:47,045 --> 00:37:50,845
Speaker 2:  possible with the goal of then starting to seed some third

605
00:37:50,845 --> 00:37:54,485
Speaker 2:  party development. We haven't seen a lot actually we haven't seen those specific

606
00:37:54,485 --> 00:37:58,005
Speaker 2:  things pan out instead actually we ended up seeing as a third party risk

607
00:37:58,005 --> 00:38:01,605
Speaker 2:  five main board, we actually didn't anticipate that at all instead. So instead

608
00:38:02,025 --> 00:38:05,245
Speaker 2:  we instead ended up getting that. But basically when whenever we do these

609
00:38:05,245 --> 00:38:08,765
Speaker 2:  types of proofs of concept, it's oftentimes to

610
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:12,965
Speaker 2:  show technical feasibility to enable third parties to go and run with

611
00:38:12,965 --> 00:38:16,885
Speaker 2:  it or even enable the community go and run with it. And so for battery pack

612
00:38:16,885 --> 00:38:19,885
Speaker 2:  that is still one that we would love to see a third party or even a community

613
00:38:19,885 --> 00:38:23,125
Speaker 2:  member start to design on their own. And it's also something that like for

614
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:27,045
Speaker 2:  us in framework as we have a larger team over time as we

615
00:38:27,045 --> 00:38:30,925
Speaker 2:  have more resources over time is the sort of thing that potentially we would

616
00:38:30,925 --> 00:38:34,725
Speaker 2:  also go and start to address. But the reason we showed it so early was more

617
00:38:35,025 --> 00:38:36,965
Speaker 2:  the technical proof of of feasibility

618
00:38:38,265 --> 00:38:39,205
Speaker 6:  EPaper screens.

619
00:38:40,325 --> 00:38:43,055
Speaker 2:  Yeah, this is a, this is also an interesting one. It kind of goes back to

620
00:38:43,055 --> 00:38:46,895
Speaker 2:  this idea of like us being able to invest and be in control of our own

621
00:38:46,895 --> 00:38:50,735
Speaker 2:  destiny. Display development, aside from you know, is the second most

622
00:38:50,765 --> 00:38:54,575
Speaker 2:  expensive part of consumer electronics beyond silicon investment

623
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:58,255
Speaker 2:  doing custom silicon. And so for us being very

624
00:38:58,655 --> 00:39:02,535
Speaker 2:  selective about where we do semi customization or

625
00:39:02,535 --> 00:39:06,055
Speaker 2:  custom development displays because of the upfront cost required there.

626
00:39:06,435 --> 00:39:09,935
Speaker 2:  And so to do something like an E ink display in the proper form factor for

627
00:39:10,075 --> 00:39:14,055
Speaker 2:  any of our laptops would be an enormous sum of money we'd have to

628
00:39:14,055 --> 00:39:17,815
Speaker 2:  pay. So if the a display vendor creates something that happens

629
00:39:17,915 --> 00:39:21,575
Speaker 2:  to be close and we can semi customize, if that becomes more feasible, the

630
00:39:21,575 --> 00:39:25,455
Speaker 2:  investment to do a fully custom display is just, at least for us today,

631
00:39:25,455 --> 00:39:28,975
Speaker 2:  still pretty far out of reach the framework. Kindle is a thing I want to

632
00:39:28,975 --> 00:39:32,495
Speaker 2:  exist just said. Just, I just want you to know that. Okay, there we go. That's

633
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:35,175
Speaker 2:  another, we can put that on the, on the quadrant somewhere.

634
00:39:36,035 --> 00:39:37,495
Speaker 6:  And lastly Nvidia

635
00:39:38,565 --> 00:39:39,655
Speaker 2:  Sure that's a company

636
00:39:40,475 --> 00:39:42,935
Speaker 6:  It sure is. Sure is. That's a vergecast.

637
00:43:43,785 --> 00:43:47,475
Speaker 2:  Welcome back a couple of weeks ago. The big news in the entertainment world

638
00:43:47,535 --> 00:43:51,435
Speaker 2:  was that Amazon had struck a deal to give it full creative control over James

639
00:43:51,465 --> 00:43:55,315
Speaker 2:  Bond basically for decades. The way that James Bond

640
00:43:55,415 --> 00:43:59,355
Speaker 2:  has worked, that whole franchise has been controlled by one

641
00:43:59,355 --> 00:44:02,835
Speaker 2:  family, the broccoli. You may have heard of these people before.

642
00:44:03,395 --> 00:44:07,355
Speaker 2:  Barbara Broccoli for many, many years has been the person overseeing the

643
00:44:07,355 --> 00:44:10,635
Speaker 2:  James Bond franchise. Other people distribute the movies, other people do

644
00:44:10,635 --> 00:44:13,835
Speaker 2:  a lot of the work to make the movies obviously, but no one does anything

645
00:44:13,835 --> 00:44:17,475
Speaker 2:  with James Bond without the broccoli say so. And they've been, to their credit,

646
00:44:17,585 --> 00:44:21,035
Speaker 2:  very precious about that. But then Amazon bought

647
00:44:21,275 --> 00:44:25,035
Speaker 2:  MGM for eight and a half billion dollars a couple of years ago. And

648
00:44:25,435 --> 00:44:29,075
Speaker 2:  a big part of what MGM had to offer was James Bond. Since then,

649
00:44:29,565 --> 00:44:33,285
Speaker 2:  there has been no James Bond. So Amazon, by all accounts,

650
00:44:33,285 --> 00:44:37,165
Speaker 2:  made a deal to have the broccoli relinquish creative control so that

651
00:44:37,165 --> 00:44:40,365
Speaker 2:  what happens to James Bond now is fully up to Amazon.

652
00:44:40,945 --> 00:44:44,765
Speaker 2:  And that made a lot of people, including really anyone who likes

653
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:48,005
Speaker 2:  and cares about James Bond stuff and wants James Bond stuff to be good,

654
00:44:48,755 --> 00:44:52,605
Speaker 2:  feel a lot of feelings. I would not say the overall reaction

655
00:44:52,625 --> 00:44:56,525
Speaker 2:  to this was like great enthusiasm for the future of James Bond. It

656
00:44:56,525 --> 00:45:00,485
Speaker 2:  was people worrying about what will happen when Amazon does

657
00:45:00,485 --> 00:45:03,925
Speaker 2:  what Disney did to Marvel or to Star Wars and just

658
00:45:04,665 --> 00:45:08,405
Speaker 2:  floods the zone with stuff because that's what the business demands

659
00:45:08,815 --> 00:45:12,805
Speaker 2:  until it kind of ruins the vibe. I have been trying to figure out how

660
00:45:12,805 --> 00:45:16,725
Speaker 2:  to sort through all of this myself and figured that the best person

661
00:45:17,185 --> 00:45:20,805
Speaker 2:  to talk to about this is the person I know who knows the most about James

662
00:45:20,835 --> 00:45:24,725
Speaker 2:  Bond. And that is John Gruber from Daring Fireball. So he is gonna come

663
00:45:24,725 --> 00:45:28,445
Speaker 2:  on and he's gonna explain how he feels why James Bond is special

664
00:45:28,865 --> 00:45:32,765
Speaker 2:  and where it goes from here under the control of Amazon. Let's get into it.

665
00:45:33,465 --> 00:45:35,035
Speaker 2:  John Gruber, welcome to The Vergecast.

666
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:36,555
Speaker 10:  Nice to be here, David.

667
00:45:36,825 --> 00:45:39,715
Speaker 2:  Okay, so the, the news I think at this point is a couple of weeks old, but

668
00:45:39,715 --> 00:45:43,675
Speaker 2:  basically where we are, and you I think have more context

669
00:45:43,815 --> 00:45:47,635
Speaker 2:  on this than I do, but basically the way I understand it is that

670
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:51,795
Speaker 2:  after a bunch of interpersonal shenanigans,

671
00:45:52,215 --> 00:45:55,995
Speaker 2:  Amazon wrote a very large check the number that, which at least I

672
00:45:56,055 --> 00:45:59,355
Speaker 2:  do not know yet Yeah. To the broccoli and now have

673
00:46:00,275 --> 00:46:04,235
Speaker 2:  creative control over the James Bond franchise for the first time. Is that

674
00:46:04,275 --> 00:46:05,235
Speaker 2:  a reasonable summary of where

675
00:46:05,235 --> 00:46:09,155
Speaker 10:  We are? I think so, yes. I I guess the part that I'm still confused on,

676
00:46:09,175 --> 00:46:12,235
Speaker 10:  and maybe everybody is, other than the broccolis and

677
00:46:12,635 --> 00:46:16,435
Speaker 10:  Amazon's top executives is exactly where they

678
00:46:16,435 --> 00:46:20,115
Speaker 10:  were before last week's news that okay, we're gonna write a check and just

679
00:46:20,115 --> 00:46:23,835
Speaker 10:  take control. It was like, you know, like what amount

680
00:46:24,215 --> 00:46:27,435
Speaker 10:  of control did MGM have that gave

681
00:46:28,335 --> 00:46:32,315
Speaker 10:  Amazon power to, you know, that that that left them at a logger

682
00:46:32,315 --> 00:46:35,355
Speaker 10:  jam. You know, it seemed like basically MGM

683
00:46:36,135 --> 00:46:39,955
Speaker 10:  has the rights to some aspect of the franchise,

684
00:46:40,175 --> 00:46:43,835
Speaker 10:  you know what I mean? Like the broccolis couldn't make movies without MGM,

685
00:46:44,015 --> 00:46:47,995
Speaker 10:  but MGM couldn't make the movies without the broccolis

686
00:46:47,995 --> 00:46:50,875
Speaker 10:  having complete control over the creative element. Something like that.

687
00:46:51,345 --> 00:46:54,755
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's a, it's a very odd setup and I think I, I was going back and reading

688
00:46:54,755 --> 00:46:58,515
Speaker 2:  some of the coverage of the MGM acquisition in the first place.

689
00:46:58,615 --> 00:47:02,275
Speaker 2:  So Amazon bought MGM for eight and a half billion dollars. That deal closed,

690
00:47:02,915 --> 00:47:06,755
Speaker 2:  I think early 2022. And even back

691
00:47:06,755 --> 00:47:10,475
Speaker 2:  then, the, the read was that like the, the crown jewel of the empire

692
00:47:10,585 --> 00:47:13,915
Speaker 2:  here Yeah. Is James Bond, right? Like there's a lot of content. Amazon wants

693
00:47:13,915 --> 00:47:17,075
Speaker 2:  a lot of stuff. They want the studio, they want the, the library, but like

694
00:47:17,295 --> 00:47:20,475
Speaker 2:  the, the thing that you're buying the IP at the top of all of this

695
00:47:21,175 --> 00:47:24,595
Speaker 2:  is James Bond. And since then precisely nothing has happened,

696
00:47:25,205 --> 00:47:28,955
Speaker 2:  which is so strange and, and I think just speaks to the

697
00:47:29,045 --> 00:47:29,965
Speaker 2:  weirdness of all of this

698
00:47:30,195 --> 00:47:34,085
Speaker 10:  Yeah. Other than stories coming out that nothing was happening, right.

699
00:47:34,385 --> 00:47:37,645
Speaker 10:  And that it was sort of conspicuous that nothing was happening. It wasn't

700
00:47:37,645 --> 00:47:41,605
Speaker 10:  just secrecy behind the scenes, it was, hey, something's broken behind

701
00:47:41,605 --> 00:47:42,525
Speaker 10:  the scenes, you know?

702
00:47:42,995 --> 00:47:46,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. So what, what was your feeling when this news dropped? Like how

703
00:47:46,205 --> 00:47:50,165
Speaker 2:  do your, what's your immediate reaction to the change that came out

704
00:47:50,165 --> 00:47:50,845
Speaker 2:  a couple of weeks ago?

705
00:47:52,605 --> 00:47:56,445
Speaker 10:  I, my heart sunk, I guess because I think, I don't think

706
00:47:56,445 --> 00:48:00,005
Speaker 10:  it's impossible that, that, that, that in

707
00:48:00,005 --> 00:48:03,805
Speaker 10:  hindsight we can look back and say, you know what? This wasn't so bad,

708
00:48:03,945 --> 00:48:07,885
Speaker 10:  or something good came out of it and I'll, I'll put a pin in that and we

709
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:11,445
Speaker 10:  can come back to what I think might be the best case scenario. But I think

710
00:48:11,445 --> 00:48:14,685
Speaker 10:  the most likely scenario is that

711
00:48:15,715 --> 00:48:19,085
Speaker 10:  this is just not gonna be good. And,

712
00:48:19,865 --> 00:48:23,405
Speaker 10:  and I'll compare it directly to Disney buying

713
00:48:23,765 --> 00:48:26,245
Speaker 10:  Lucasfilm from George Lucas,

714
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:29,925
Speaker 2:  Another franchise you care very much about. If I'm not mistaken,

715
00:48:30,045 --> 00:48:32,845
Speaker 10:  I I do care. Well it's certainly Star Wars. Yes. Yeah. Definitely.

716
00:48:33,755 --> 00:48:37,365
Speaker 10:  Very, very meaningful, important to me. And I,

717
00:48:37,745 --> 00:48:41,485
Speaker 10:  and similarly, I, you know, Lucas film, there was a lot more than just

718
00:48:41,515 --> 00:48:44,765
Speaker 10:  Star Wars, you know, there was the Indiana Jones franchise, there's the

719
00:48:44,765 --> 00:48:48,605
Speaker 10:  whole industrial light and magic, everything else Lucas Film

720
00:48:48,605 --> 00:48:52,405
Speaker 10:  does, ILM in particular, you know, is, is just a,

721
00:48:52,465 --> 00:48:56,445
Speaker 10:  you know, VERGE listeners don't need to be told what they do or their

722
00:48:56,445 --> 00:49:00,365
Speaker 10:  role in the industry. But overall, I

723
00:49:00,365 --> 00:49:04,285
Speaker 10:  just feel like what we've seen Disney do with the Star Wars franchise is

724
00:49:04,285 --> 00:49:07,965
Speaker 10:  what we'll see Amazon do with the James Bond franchise, which is

725
00:49:09,305 --> 00:49:12,885
Speaker 10:  dilute it, you know, with spinoffs and shows and cartoons

726
00:49:13,105 --> 00:49:16,845
Speaker 10:  and, and you know, for some fans, you know, there are,

727
00:49:17,105 --> 00:49:20,605
Speaker 10:  I'm sure you can dig up some fans who think Disney's done nothing but a

728
00:49:20,605 --> 00:49:24,525
Speaker 10:  bang up job with Star Wars or more positive than negative.

729
00:49:25,865 --> 00:49:28,805
Speaker 10:  But it's definitely a change. It's a definite,

730
00:49:30,105 --> 00:49:33,325
Speaker 10:  you know, and this whole idea of calling it content, you know, or whatever

731
00:49:33,325 --> 00:49:36,805
Speaker 10:  else you want to call it, which is what the major big tech

732
00:49:37,365 --> 00:49:41,325
Speaker 10:  streamer, corporations who are making these deals and writing these checks

733
00:49:42,065 --> 00:49:45,525
Speaker 10:  the way they tend to look at it as opposed to an artistic endeavor. And

734
00:49:45,525 --> 00:49:49,485
Speaker 10:  I will compare it, one difference with James Bond and Star Wars is

735
00:49:49,485 --> 00:49:53,325
Speaker 10:  that when Disney bought Star Wars, there had only been six movies

736
00:49:53,395 --> 00:49:56,525
Speaker 10:  made. And yes, there were like comic books and there was somewhat of an

737
00:49:57,045 --> 00:50:00,605
Speaker 10:  expanded empire, but nothing like what we've seen

738
00:50:01,015 --> 00:50:04,765
Speaker 10:  since. And the James Bond franchise is different because it goes

739
00:50:04,765 --> 00:50:08,645
Speaker 10:  back so much further to the sixties and you know, at this point there've

740
00:50:08,645 --> 00:50:11,885
Speaker 10:  been, I guess 25 movies, you'd think I know that before I came in the show,

741
00:50:13,065 --> 00:50:17,005
Speaker 10:  but it's just a longer stretch of time. And there was

742
00:50:17,085 --> 00:50:20,365
Speaker 10:  a similarity where the franchises were defined by

743
00:50:20,455 --> 00:50:24,245
Speaker 10:  theatrical major motion pictures that were events.

744
00:50:24,655 --> 00:50:28,525
Speaker 10:  Right. Like, holy crap, George Lucas is finally gonna make those

745
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:32,445
Speaker 10:  prequels that he was, you know, rumored to be working on even when he was

746
00:50:32,445 --> 00:50:36,405
Speaker 10:  working on the original trilogy back in the seventies and eighties. Wow.

747
00:50:38,065 --> 00:50:41,885
Speaker 10:  Or wow, they've announced a new James Bond. It's a guy named Daniel Craig,

748
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:45,845
Speaker 10:  and he's got blonde hair, not dark hair, and people are upset about

749
00:50:45,845 --> 00:50:46,445
Speaker 10:  that. And

750
00:50:48,155 --> 00:50:52,085
Speaker 10:  it's a new, you know, or, or here. Ja Daniel Craig's coming back for a fifth

751
00:50:52,085 --> 00:50:55,805
Speaker 10:  movie, and it's definitely gonna be the last one. You know, it, it's an

752
00:50:55,805 --> 00:50:59,725
Speaker 10:  event and, you know, oh, here's a series about Young

753
00:50:59,725 --> 00:51:02,325
Speaker 10:  Money Penny. Here's 10 episode series about

754
00:51:03,695 --> 00:51:07,525
Speaker 10:  Felix Lighter in the CIA, here's the Young James Bond cartoon,

755
00:51:07,615 --> 00:51:11,205
Speaker 10:  which I know sort of exists, you know, but it's just gonna be more of it.

756
00:51:12,865 --> 00:51:15,605
Speaker 2:  So this is the thing I'm, I'm sort of torn on. And I think

757
00:51:17,185 --> 00:51:20,565
Speaker 2:  one of the, the challenge I have in thinking through all of this is, on the

758
00:51:20,565 --> 00:51:24,385
Speaker 2:  one hand, it's not like every James Bond movie ever has

759
00:51:24,385 --> 00:51:28,275
Speaker 2:  been Perfect and fabulous, and this is like a, a beautiful,

760
00:51:28,275 --> 00:51:31,515
Speaker 2:  pristine thing, right. That cannot be touched. Right? Like, there have been

761
00:51:31,535 --> 00:51:35,275
Speaker 2:  bad bond movies there. I love them all, if I'm honest, but some of them are

762
00:51:35,275 --> 00:51:39,235
Speaker 2:  very bad. Right. And, and even there, there have

763
00:51:39,235 --> 00:51:43,155
Speaker 2:  been sort of spinoff things over the years, like goldeneye

764
00:51:43,155 --> 00:51:47,115
Speaker 2:  on the N 64, obviously a like classic iconic video games, but there

765
00:51:47,115 --> 00:51:49,795
Speaker 2:  have been other James Bond video games that I don't remember the name of.

766
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:53,715
Speaker 2:  Yes. Because they're not any good. And so they've, they've experimented

767
00:51:53,715 --> 00:51:57,675
Speaker 2:  with this over time. And I think there is definitely an extent to which

768
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:01,835
Speaker 2:  I think the, the broccoli in this sort of unusual setup

769
00:52:01,835 --> 00:52:04,955
Speaker 2:  where basically a couple of people had creative control over whether things

770
00:52:05,115 --> 00:52:08,875
Speaker 2:  happened or didn't, has probably avoided bad things, but it

771
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:12,675
Speaker 2:  hasn't avoided all of the bad things. Right. And so maybe it's like,

772
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:16,955
Speaker 2:  the part of me that is optimistic is like, okay, maybe nobody's perfect and

773
00:52:18,705 --> 00:52:22,055
Speaker 2:  maybe, maybe there will be good stuff and maybe I can just watch the good

774
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:24,855
Speaker 2:  stuff and ignore the bad stuff. But that's also the Star Wars play. Yeah.

775
00:52:24,855 --> 00:52:28,015
Speaker 2:  And I have basically been run out of the Star Wars franchise. Yeah. By the

776
00:52:28,015 --> 00:52:31,015
Speaker 2:  way, it has run over the last decade. So I don't know, I'm, I'm torn between

777
00:52:31,015 --> 00:52:32,055
Speaker 2:  these two feelings.

778
00:52:32,925 --> 00:52:36,775
Speaker 10:  Yeah. And I, you know, I I, I say that as a real big fan of,

779
00:52:36,935 --> 00:52:40,655
Speaker 10:  I mean, that's why you're, I'm here and a long time ago, in the first run

780
00:52:40,755 --> 00:52:44,295
Speaker 10:  of my podcast, the talk show, when I was co-hosting it with Dan

781
00:52:44,535 --> 00:52:48,375
Speaker 10:  Benjamin, this is like, oh man, like 2008, 2009, early, I mean,

782
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:51,975
Speaker 10:  literally like early days of podcasting, we had the idea

783
00:52:52,355 --> 00:52:52,575
Speaker 10:  to,

784
00:52:54,315 --> 00:52:58,175
Speaker 10:  at the tail, you know, the, the topic was typically Apple and the usual

785
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:01,895
Speaker 10:  stuff I talk about on the talk show. And we had the

786
00:53:01,895 --> 00:53:05,535
Speaker 10:  idea for, I forget how many movies had been out at that point, but let's

787
00:53:05,535 --> 00:53:09,295
Speaker 10:  say it was like 19 bond movies had been made to date.

788
00:53:09,465 --> 00:53:12,775
Speaker 10:  Let's take the next 19 episodes and in chronological order

789
00:53:13,305 --> 00:53:16,815
Speaker 10:  we'll talk about each one at the end of the show, like the last 20 minutes

790
00:53:16,915 --> 00:53:20,495
Speaker 10:  of each show, we'll talk about each of the Bond movies in order and we will,

791
00:53:20,555 --> 00:53:24,455
Speaker 10:  you know, we will watch 'em in order again. And you

792
00:53:24,485 --> 00:53:27,845
Speaker 10:  listeners following along, you'll know 'cause we're going in chronological

793
00:53:27,845 --> 00:53:30,605
Speaker 10:  order. Your homework If you don't want this spoiled will be to do it. And

794
00:53:30,605 --> 00:53:31,485
Speaker 10:  it was a lot of fun.

795
00:53:33,025 --> 00:53:36,925
Speaker 10:  But rewatching them all in order, you, you know, and we

796
00:53:36,925 --> 00:53:40,885
Speaker 10:  talked about it week to week, you know, it, they're uneven. Right? They're,

797
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:44,765
Speaker 10:  some of them are not great. Some of them don't hold up and

798
00:53:44,765 --> 00:53:48,685
Speaker 10:  it's kind of interesting watching them again. But

799
00:53:48,765 --> 00:53:52,685
Speaker 10:  I don't think it's for lack of effort. Right. It's the, and I think

800
00:53:52,685 --> 00:53:56,405
Speaker 10:  that's the difference is that when, like with Disney's

801
00:53:56,405 --> 00:54:00,245
Speaker 10:  current stewardship of Star Wars or the Avens too, the

802
00:54:00,245 --> 00:54:04,005
Speaker 10:  Marvel universe, right? With the amount that

803
00:54:04,005 --> 00:54:07,805
Speaker 10:  they're putting out, there's no intention to, to try to make

804
00:54:07,805 --> 00:54:11,525
Speaker 10:  everything great. Hmm. Right. That's, it's like,

805
00:54:11,585 --> 00:54:14,845
Speaker 10:  that's, that's the difference is that when you know you're putting out

806
00:54:15,625 --> 00:54:19,205
Speaker 10:  all of these hours of content and they call it content

807
00:54:19,675 --> 00:54:23,325
Speaker 10:  each year, you know, that the overall quality

808
00:54:23,585 --> 00:54:27,285
Speaker 10:  is trying f to be like, I don't know, good

809
00:54:27,585 --> 00:54:31,085
Speaker 10:  at best. Yeah. It's not trying to make everything great and,

810
00:54:31,505 --> 00:54:34,405
Speaker 10:  you know, and we can talk about the, that, that a lot of people, especially

811
00:54:34,405 --> 00:54:38,165
Speaker 10:  people of our generation, have very, a lot of people have very

812
00:54:38,405 --> 00:54:42,045
Speaker 10:  negative feelings about George Lucas's own second trilogy in the Star Wars

813
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:45,445
Speaker 10:  movie. Yeah. I personally, I don't love it like I do the first ones, but

814
00:54:45,485 --> 00:54:49,205
Speaker 10:  I actually don't hate it like most people of my generation do. I actually

815
00:54:49,205 --> 00:54:53,085
Speaker 10:  like the movies overall, and I, I like their weirdness and I

816
00:54:53,085 --> 00:54:57,005
Speaker 10:  like that they're not just trying to redo what the first trilogy felt like.

817
00:54:57,465 --> 00:55:01,445
Speaker 10:  And I really noticed with my son's generation, my son's

818
00:55:01,445 --> 00:55:05,125
Speaker 10:  21 now, but he was a little kid when those movies were like new. His

819
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,925
Speaker 10:  generation didn't really see a difference between the old trilogy and the

820
00:55:08,925 --> 00:55:11,885
Speaker 10:  new trilogy. They just loved Star Wars, you know? Yeah.

821
00:55:12,155 --> 00:55:15,925
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So much of that stuff is, is tied to sort of time

822
00:55:15,985 --> 00:55:19,285
Speaker 2:  and moments in your life in a way that's always really hard to peel apart

823
00:55:19,285 --> 00:55:23,085
Speaker 2:  that like Right. Whichever part of it you saw when you were 12 is

824
00:55:23,285 --> 00:55:25,965
Speaker 2:  probably your favorite. Yeah, definitely. It's just a hard thing to undo.

825
00:55:25,965 --> 00:55:26,245
Speaker 2:  Well,

826
00:55:26,245 --> 00:55:28,725
Speaker 10:  And that's, and you know, and they, that that just came up recently with

827
00:55:29,055 --> 00:55:32,845
Speaker 10:  SNL's 50 right. 50th anniversary where so many people, and there's so many

828
00:55:33,035 --> 00:55:36,485
Speaker 10:  cool documentaries that came out about that, but over and over again, and

829
00:55:36,525 --> 00:55:39,565
Speaker 10:  I think it's, this is one of those things that we can debate what the best

830
00:55:39,955 --> 00:55:43,685
Speaker 10:  eras of SNL were. But one thing that's almost un debatable is that

831
00:55:43,755 --> 00:55:47,445
Speaker 10:  most people feel that the quote unquote Best

832
00:55:47,445 --> 00:55:50,965
Speaker 10:  Years and the best cast were the ones when they were like a teenager and

833
00:55:50,965 --> 00:55:54,245
Speaker 10:  they first started getting late night adult

834
00:55:54,635 --> 00:55:58,605
Speaker 10:  sarcasm and humor. And so it didn't matter how old you are, you kind of

835
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:01,805
Speaker 10:  have this sweet spot in your head. And I think the James Bond movies are

836
00:56:01,805 --> 00:56:05,285
Speaker 10:  like that, right? Everybody has a sweet spot for the sweet place in their

837
00:56:05,285 --> 00:56:08,885
Speaker 10:  heart for the James Bond of their youth, of the new movie, you know, whatever

838
00:56:08,885 --> 00:56:12,125
Speaker 10:  were the new Bond movies when they were young and they first fell in love

839
00:56:12,125 --> 00:56:15,605
Speaker 10:  at the franchise, you know, and then you get older and you get more of an

840
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:18,805
Speaker 10:  appreciation for going back in time and sort of putting things in perspective.

841
00:56:18,945 --> 00:56:22,525
Speaker 10:  But that, that, that's to me, the difference is that the Broccolis

842
00:56:22,785 --> 00:56:26,325
Speaker 10:  for 20 some movies were always trying to make each one

843
00:56:26,965 --> 00:56:30,685
Speaker 10:  a great bond movie, and they fell short. Sometimes I think you make 25

844
00:56:30,685 --> 00:56:34,565
Speaker 10:  movies, you know, and you try to take risks and you're trying not to repeat

845
00:56:34,765 --> 00:56:38,645
Speaker 10:  yourself and you're trying to keep Bond. And

846
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:42,325
Speaker 10:  I think they did this remarkably so like keep Bond

847
00:56:42,515 --> 00:56:46,365
Speaker 10:  current through the sixties, the seventies, the eighties.

848
00:56:46,765 --> 00:56:49,845
Speaker 10:  I mean, it's a long time to keep a character current through

849
00:56:50,645 --> 00:56:54,485
Speaker 10:  dramatic changes in culture, history, world, geopolitics,

850
00:56:54,825 --> 00:56:58,805
Speaker 10:  things that affect a, a spy movie. You know, they,

851
00:56:59,075 --> 00:57:02,805
Speaker 10:  some were great, some not so great, but they were always trying.

852
00:57:03,075 --> 00:57:03,365
Speaker 10:  Yeah.

853
00:57:03,625 --> 00:57:07,545
Speaker 2:  To that end actually, why do you think this character

854
00:57:07,545 --> 00:57:10,625
Speaker 2:  and this franchise has been this enduring because it's,

855
00:57:11,415 --> 00:57:14,625
Speaker 2:  it's kind of unparalleled right? In that sense that, like

856
00:57:15,325 --> 00:57:18,785
Speaker 2:  Ja James Bond is, is I think very

857
00:57:18,785 --> 00:57:22,665
Speaker 2:  different as a, a character from first movie

858
00:57:22,765 --> 00:57:26,625
Speaker 2:  to, you know, no Time to Die. Yeah. But it's also pretty recognizably the

859
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:29,945
Speaker 2:  same the whole way through. And for that to happen

860
00:57:30,765 --> 00:57:34,665
Speaker 2:  and still be, even have the possibility of being any good is

861
00:57:34,875 --> 00:57:38,815
Speaker 2:  pretty unusual with, with any kind of franchise like

862
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:42,175
Speaker 2:  that. The, just the fact that it hasn't run out of steam yet

863
00:57:42,945 --> 00:57:44,845
Speaker 2:  is kind of wild. What is your sense of why that is?

864
00:57:45,465 --> 00:57:48,925
Speaker 10:  How much time do we have? Right? I mean, that's sort of what makes me obsessed

865
00:57:48,925 --> 00:57:52,885
Speaker 10:  with the franchise is trying to answer that question and sort of the

866
00:57:52,885 --> 00:57:56,725
Speaker 10:  impossibility of really buttonholing it very neatly

867
00:57:56,755 --> 00:58:00,645
Speaker 10:  into a very succinct ah, yes, that's exactly how they've done it. Argument

868
00:58:00,645 --> 00:58:04,485
Speaker 10:  like, you're not gonna get there. And that's what makes it endlessly fascinating

869
00:58:04,665 --> 00:58:08,405
Speaker 10:  and fun to discuss. If I had to try to

870
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:11,965
Speaker 10:  encapsulate it though, I think the things that they did that really made

871
00:58:11,965 --> 00:58:15,645
Speaker 10:  this built, built to last, and it sounds

872
00:58:17,965 --> 00:58:21,565
Speaker 10:  cynical, but I mean this in an endearing way that they, they

873
00:58:21,835 --> 00:58:25,325
Speaker 10:  established a brand for James Bond, right?

874
00:58:25,825 --> 00:58:29,325
Speaker 10:  And right out of the gate, they had this, the theme song in the first one,

875
00:58:29,425 --> 00:58:33,245
Speaker 10:  Dr. No, the theme song was cool when it

876
00:58:33,365 --> 00:58:37,205
Speaker 10:  was new in 1962. And it's sort of timeless now, right? Yeah. Star

877
00:58:37,205 --> 00:58:40,605
Speaker 10:  Wars got that right too, right. With the great John Williams score, right?

878
00:58:40,635 --> 00:58:44,565
Speaker 10:  Like, and and the logo for Star Wars, the logo for

879
00:58:44,565 --> 00:58:48,325
Speaker 10:  James Bond with the O oh and the seven that shaped like a Luger or

880
00:58:48,325 --> 00:58:52,165
Speaker 10:  something, which isn't even a gun James Bond used. Right. And he, you know,

881
00:58:52,165 --> 00:58:56,125
Speaker 10:  and that ties into other aspects of the brand, like

882
00:58:56,125 --> 00:58:59,885
Speaker 10:  the fact that James Bond is persnickety and very

883
00:59:00,015 --> 00:59:03,605
Speaker 10:  picky about certain things. He wants to use a certain gun

884
00:59:03,835 --> 00:59:07,205
Speaker 10:  like that's his favorite gun, you know, the Walter

885
00:59:07,445 --> 00:59:08,965
Speaker 10:  PPK for most of the run, and

886
00:59:10,905 --> 00:59:14,765
Speaker 10:  he wants his martini famously prepared just right.

887
00:59:15,025 --> 00:59:19,005
Speaker 10:  You know, and, and that sort of pickiness of the character becomes part

888
00:59:19,005 --> 00:59:22,735
Speaker 10:  of the brand. And I think that they

889
00:59:22,735 --> 00:59:26,415
Speaker 10:  managed it over the years to sort of keep that fundamental

890
00:59:26,905 --> 00:59:30,775
Speaker 10:  brand timeless. And then they could decorate around

891
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:34,655
Speaker 10:  it with each decade and with each actor as they, as they move it forward.

892
00:59:35,075 --> 00:59:38,095
Speaker 10:  But that, that core brand resonates with people.

893
00:59:39,015 --> 00:59:42,175
Speaker 2:  I I totally agree with that. And I think part of the reason I'm thinking

894
00:59:42,175 --> 00:59:45,655
Speaker 2:  about this is 'cause I have to assume that if you're Amazon,

895
00:59:46,325 --> 00:59:49,855
Speaker 2:  that is the big question to try and figure out, right? Is like, what,

896
00:59:50,525 --> 00:59:54,215
Speaker 2:  what about this can we not change? Because I think

897
00:59:54,805 --> 00:59:58,655
Speaker 2:  what I assume to be true, and I I I'm curious if, If you feel differently,

898
00:59:58,715 --> 01:00:02,575
Speaker 2:  but what I assume is true is that every imaginable branch

899
01:00:03,155 --> 01:00:07,135
Speaker 2:  of the, The James Bond Cinematic Universe is about to come true. We're gonna

900
01:00:07,135 --> 01:00:11,095
Speaker 2:  get more Bond movies, we're gonna get a a Q spinoff that's gonna

901
01:00:11,095 --> 01:00:15,015
Speaker 2:  be like a tech show. We're gonna get the, we're gonna get a Money Penny thing.

902
01:00:15,015 --> 01:00:18,615
Speaker 2:  They're gonna do a whole thing about, you know, minor characters. We're gonna,

903
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,935
Speaker 2:  we're gonna spin this thing in every single direction. And I feel like if

904
01:00:20,935 --> 01:00:24,375
Speaker 2:  I'm the person in charge of James Bond at Amazon, the question now is,

905
01:00:25,805 --> 01:00:29,455
Speaker 2:  what, what do you have to have inside of one of these to make it

906
01:00:30,305 --> 01:00:34,045
Speaker 2:  work, to make it James Bond? And in a weird way,

907
01:00:34,185 --> 01:00:38,045
Speaker 2:  the the answer to that question seems to both be like, scarcity, you

908
01:00:38,205 --> 01:00:41,045
Speaker 2:  actually can't do too much. That's like a part of the whole James Bond thing

909
01:00:41,045 --> 01:00:44,645
Speaker 2:  that I think if we had done 50 movies by now instead of 25, it might actually

910
01:00:44,645 --> 01:00:48,085
Speaker 2:  be really different. But that also, even that thing you're describing is

911
01:00:48,085 --> 01:00:51,925
Speaker 2:  hard to, you can't just have him say shaken, not stirred once an episode

912
01:00:51,985 --> 01:00:54,925
Speaker 2:  and get away with it being a bond show. You know what I mean? Right. I feel

913
01:00:54,925 --> 01:00:58,205
Speaker 2:  like that's a hard thing to define with Bond in a way that even Star Wars,

914
01:00:58,465 --> 01:01:01,965
Speaker 2:  you just start with like Galaxy far, far away permission to kind of do whatever

915
01:01:01,965 --> 01:01:04,845
Speaker 2:  we want. And I think that was the wrong approach, but you can at least see

916
01:01:04,845 --> 01:01:07,205
Speaker 2:  how you start from that. James Bond is harder to define that way.

917
01:01:07,555 --> 01:01:11,345
Speaker 10:  Yeah. And it's it because there is

918
01:01:11,445 --> 01:01:15,225
Speaker 10:  no one central character of Star Wars, right. That's different. Right.

919
01:01:15,295 --> 01:01:18,385
Speaker 10:  It's not the Luke Skywalker cinematic universe, or

920
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:21,345
Speaker 2:  I think they decided it was the force, right? Right. That was like, they

921
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:23,745
Speaker 2:  were like, that is the unifying theme and it just didn't work.

922
01:01:24,495 --> 01:01:25,265
Speaker 10:  Yeah. And

923
01:01:27,615 --> 01:01:31,545
Speaker 10:  like, what is the greater James Bond cinematic universe?

924
01:01:31,735 --> 01:01:35,545
Speaker 10:  It's just the world, right? It's the modern world, right. Where that's,

925
01:01:35,605 --> 01:01:39,425
Speaker 10:  and that's where it just seems more worrisome to me even than Star Wars,

926
01:01:39,425 --> 01:01:43,265
Speaker 10:  right? Like where, like the, to

927
01:01:43,285 --> 01:01:47,145
Speaker 10:  me clearly better parts of the Disney era,

928
01:01:47,255 --> 01:01:51,185
Speaker 10:  star Wars and or which itself is sort of

929
01:01:51,185 --> 01:01:54,905
Speaker 10:  a spinoff from my favorite movie they've made since then. The

930
01:01:55,395 --> 01:01:56,105
Speaker 10:  Rogue One,

931
01:01:57,765 --> 01:02:01,625
Speaker 10:  you know, which isn't about the main characters, you know, it parlays into

932
01:02:01,625 --> 01:02:05,465
Speaker 10:  the story of them and it takes place in their era, but it's like,

933
01:02:05,765 --> 01:02:08,745
Speaker 10:  ah, but here's the thing that's happening over on the side side, but what,

934
01:02:08,765 --> 01:02:12,745
Speaker 10:  what's happening in the James Bond universe when we're not paying

935
01:02:12,745 --> 01:02:16,585
Speaker 10:  attention to that? Him himself, the agent oh

936
01:02:16,585 --> 01:02:20,205
Speaker 10:  oh seven for MI six, it's just the world,

937
01:02:20,335 --> 01:02:21,205
Speaker 10:  right? So

938
01:02:21,785 --> 01:02:25,045
Speaker 2:  That's so true. Yeah. They're gonna end up having to make a movie about the

939
01:02:25,045 --> 01:02:28,725
Speaker 2:  financial crisis, right? That is like just James Bond appears one time and

940
01:02:28,725 --> 01:02:30,205
Speaker 2:  they're like, I guess this is a James Bond movie.

941
01:02:30,465 --> 01:02:34,085
Speaker 10:  And, and, and so what are the odds when they do a Felix lighter spinoff

942
01:02:34,815 --> 01:02:38,645
Speaker 10:  about the American CIA agents in the world

943
01:02:39,125 --> 01:02:42,725
Speaker 10:  fighting, you know, the same agents of evil of

944
01:02:42,795 --> 01:02:45,565
Speaker 10:  Specter or whatever they do when they reboot it.

945
01:02:47,765 --> 01:02:51,705
Speaker 10:  You know, how is that gonna be any different than just any random CIA show

946
01:02:51,705 --> 01:02:55,545
Speaker 10:  that Amazon puts on Prime? Right? And, and that this is the other

947
01:02:55,545 --> 01:02:58,585
Speaker 10:  part, to go back to your question from 10 minutes ago about why my heart

948
01:02:58,745 --> 01:03:02,545
Speaker 10:  sunk, the other thing that really, really has me bummed about this

949
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:06,945
Speaker 10:  is, I, I think of the major streamers, Amazon Prime's original

950
01:03:06,945 --> 01:03:08,025
Speaker 10:  content is the worst.

951
01:03:08,545 --> 01:03:10,985
Speaker 2:  I was gonna ask you about this, If you were more upset that it was Amazon

952
01:03:10,985 --> 01:03:14,785
Speaker 2:  in particular than anybody else. Why I, I like

953
01:03:14,825 --> 01:03:18,105
Speaker 2:  Mr. And Mrs. Smith is my only quibble with that statement. But otherwise,

954
01:03:18,105 --> 01:03:19,145
Speaker 2:  I think I largely agree with you.

955
01:03:19,945 --> 01:03:23,825
Speaker 10:  I haven't watched the Mr. And Mrs. Smith yet, you know,

956
01:03:24,285 --> 01:03:27,865
Speaker 10:  and, and the one show that when I mentioned this on Daring, and also I'll

957
01:03:27,865 --> 01:03:31,625
Speaker 10:  add that to my list and I, you know, I like, I like spy stuff. I

958
01:03:31,625 --> 01:03:35,265
Speaker 10:  like spy shows. I just, it's spy shows, heist shows,

959
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:40,105
Speaker 10:  spy movies that are, you know, more heisty

960
01:03:40,165 --> 01:03:43,545
Speaker 10:  is sort of the sweet spot. You know, I I like that sort of

961
01:03:44,295 --> 01:03:47,985
Speaker 10:  plot. You know, it's a very middle aged white guy thing to like,

962
01:03:48,265 --> 01:03:48,945
Speaker 10:  but that's what I like.

963
01:03:53,245 --> 01:03:57,145
Speaker 10:  But I, I don't know, I I was it when I mentioned that I just don't think

964
01:03:57,145 --> 01:04:00,945
Speaker 10:  prime's original content is, is good. People pointed

965
01:04:01,005 --> 01:04:04,345
Speaker 10:  to a show called Patriot that was on it as like a sort of

966
01:04:05,385 --> 01:04:09,185
Speaker 10:  somewhat comedy, and I, I'd never even heard of it. It was on like 2015.

967
01:04:09,325 --> 01:04:12,705
Speaker 10:  It was on for two seasons and then they canceled it. So

968
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:13,785
Speaker 2:  That sounds like Amazon.

969
01:04:14,055 --> 01:04:17,945
Speaker 10:  Yeah. And I did my, my favorite show on Amazon, but I can't

970
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:21,305
Speaker 10:  recommend it. It was a show called The Peripheral from a few years ago

971
01:04:22,035 --> 01:04:26,025
Speaker 10:  based on a William Gibson novel and with a, it was really well

972
01:04:26,025 --> 01:04:29,705
Speaker 10:  done, but they canceled it after one season. And it's one of those shows

973
01:04:29,755 --> 01:04:33,305
Speaker 10:  where that's why I can't recommend it. It was a very good season, but it

974
01:04:33,305 --> 01:04:36,665
Speaker 10:  clearly stopped at a point that it, you know, they were really,

975
01:04:37,685 --> 01:04:41,225
Speaker 10:  it wasn't a, a satisfying conclusion. It was meant to keep going for at

976
01:04:41,225 --> 01:04:45,025
Speaker 10:  least another season or two, and it didn't, so it's like,

977
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:48,825
Speaker 10:  blah. So it's the best show that they made good production values, good

978
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:52,225
Speaker 10:  cast. I thought it was pretty smart because, you know, I don't, I hadn't

979
01:04:52,225 --> 01:04:56,185
Speaker 10:  read Gibson's original book, but it seemed smart enough that they surely

980
01:04:56,185 --> 01:05:00,145
Speaker 10:  seemed to use the source material well to make an

981
01:05:00,145 --> 01:05:04,105
Speaker 10:  intelligent show. So much else that I've seen on prime's just sort of like,

982
01:05:04,245 --> 01:05:06,625
Speaker 10:  it looks bad and it's sort of dumb.

983
01:05:07,495 --> 01:05:10,585
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Well, and I think I'm now thinking about

984
01:05:11,445 --> 01:05:15,305
Speaker 2:  how many of these sort of generic kind of anonymous

985
01:05:15,735 --> 01:05:19,685
Speaker 2:  seeming spy shows there are out there, and a lot of them were

986
01:05:19,685 --> 01:05:23,325
Speaker 2:  big hits. Like the, the Night Agent on Netflix is the most forgettable show

987
01:05:23,325 --> 01:05:27,165
Speaker 2:  of all time, but is a giant hit. Yeah. And then there's the recruit,

988
01:05:27,375 --> 01:05:30,605
Speaker 2:  which I thought was the night agent, but it's actually a different thing.

989
01:05:31,025 --> 01:05:34,205
Speaker 2:  And, and there's just a million of these, right? And I think,

990
01:05:34,835 --> 01:05:38,725
Speaker 2:  like, I, I probably watch more of them than most, but it, I just keep

991
01:05:38,725 --> 01:05:42,405
Speaker 2:  thinking like, you take all of that stuff and you rename it James Bond. Yeah.

992
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:45,285
Speaker 2:  And maybe that's where we're headed is we're just gonna have a million generic

993
01:05:45,285 --> 01:05:49,045
Speaker 2:  things with this name that isn't generic and that's how Amazon

994
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:52,205
Speaker 2:  feels like it can win, which is a real bummer way to go. And

995
01:05:52,205 --> 01:05:55,685
Speaker 10:  You've got to go back to the word branding. You've got this

996
01:05:56,095 --> 01:06:00,045
Speaker 10:  brand that you, you know, like a way to style the logos

997
01:06:00,265 --> 01:06:04,245
Speaker 10:  of whatever you call the show. You know, a way to style the, I don't know

998
01:06:04,245 --> 01:06:08,205
Speaker 10:  what it would be, I'm not a a logo designer, but a way to style Young

999
01:06:08,205 --> 01:06:11,805
Speaker 10:  Money Penny in a way that looks James Bond branded, you know,

1000
01:06:12,315 --> 01:06:15,605
Speaker 10:  musical scores, you know, and Disney does,

1001
01:06:16,705 --> 01:06:19,765
Speaker 10:  If you like, the proliferation of

1002
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:25,405
Speaker 10:  Cinematic universe content. I mean, Disney does a good job with stuff like

1003
01:06:25,405 --> 01:06:29,325
Speaker 10:  the music for, to various Star Wars shows, you know,

1004
01:06:29,325 --> 01:06:33,165
Speaker 10:  and it, you know, you tell from, if, If you didn't know

1005
01:06:33,165 --> 01:06:36,085
Speaker 10:  what was playing, you could just listen and say, oh, this seems like it

1006
01:06:36,085 --> 01:06:40,045
Speaker 10:  must be a Star Wars show. Right. And I guess they'll do that with the Bond,

1007
01:06:40,045 --> 01:06:42,965
Speaker 10:  greater Bond. And they, you know, they haven't said they're going to do

1008
01:06:43,005 --> 01:06:46,885
Speaker 10:  a greater bond cinematic universe, you know, like I said before, maybe

1009
01:06:46,885 --> 01:06:50,725
Speaker 10:  they'll do the right thing and sort of keep it rare

1010
01:06:51,145 --> 01:06:52,645
Speaker 10:  or special, but I doubt it.

1011
01:06:52,835 --> 01:06:55,685
Speaker 2:  What is the right thing in your mind? What, what feels like the best case

1012
01:06:56,275 --> 01:06:57,685
Speaker 2:  plausible scenario here?

1013
01:06:58,485 --> 01:07:02,445
Speaker 10:  I would say I would like to see them acknowledge.

1014
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:03,085
Speaker 10:  'cause I think,

1015
01:07:04,985 --> 01:07:08,725
Speaker 10:  and again, it sounds so simple, but obviously all of these

1016
01:07:09,045 --> 01:07:12,045
Speaker 10:  companies with all this money, they get caught up in it. Like, who thinks

1017
01:07:12,225 --> 01:07:15,285
Speaker 10:  it sounds like a good idea to run a creative artistic

1018
01:07:15,675 --> 01:07:17,125
Speaker 10:  franchise by committee

1019
01:07:18,665 --> 01:07:19,285
Speaker 10:  who thinks

1020
01:07:20,845 --> 01:07:24,285
Speaker 10:  a committee of executives in the

1021
01:07:24,285 --> 01:07:28,125
Speaker 10:  streaming company should be the ones making the artistic decisions

1022
01:07:28,505 --> 01:07:32,365
Speaker 10:  of casting and writing and plotting and pacing and, and stuff

1023
01:07:32,365 --> 01:07:36,285
Speaker 10:  like that. Nobody, right. You want filmmakers and

1024
01:07:36,525 --> 01:07:39,045
Speaker 10:  creative people making those decisions so

1025
01:07:40,675 --> 01:07:44,405
Speaker 10:  they could nip this in the bud and sort of acknowledge all of our

1026
01:07:44,415 --> 01:07:48,365
Speaker 10:  fears by, by writing a big check. And the name that comes to mind is

1027
01:07:48,365 --> 01:07:49,605
Speaker 10:  Christopher Nolan. Right?

1028
01:07:50,265 --> 01:07:52,565
Speaker 2:  Who famously at one point wanted to do a Bond movie,

1029
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:56,485
Speaker 10:  Right? And, and the problem that they ran into was

1030
01:07:56,515 --> 01:08:00,165
Speaker 10:  that the Barbara Broccoli ultimately always had

1031
01:08:00,215 --> 01:08:03,725
Speaker 10:  final cut of the bond movies. And Nolan,

1032
01:08:04,145 --> 01:08:08,085
Speaker 10:  you know, sort of irresistible force meets an immovable object, right?

1033
01:08:08,235 --> 01:08:11,845
Speaker 10:  That Nolan doesn't do anything anymore unless he gets

1034
01:08:12,285 --> 01:08:15,685
Speaker 10:  contractual, you know, not just a handshake, but in the contract Final cut.

1035
01:08:17,385 --> 01:08:21,085
Speaker 10:  But if they just said, you know, call him up and say, you know,

1036
01:08:21,535 --> 01:08:25,045
Speaker 10:  let's make a deal for a three, let's do three movies. You're in control.

1037
01:08:25,265 --> 01:08:27,565
Speaker 10:  You cast it, you you're in charge of the writing,

1038
01:08:29,015 --> 01:08:32,725
Speaker 10:  we'll give you the money. We trust you to do a great job. Just do

1039
01:08:32,735 --> 01:08:36,245
Speaker 10:  three great new, you know, reboot the franchise with a new,

1040
01:08:36,745 --> 01:08:40,645
Speaker 10:  new actor. You're in control, Christopher Nolan, that

1041
01:08:40,655 --> 01:08:44,485
Speaker 10:  would be perfect for me. Or, you know, there

1042
01:08:44,485 --> 01:08:47,685
Speaker 10:  are other people other than Christopher Nolan who, who could get that role,

1043
01:08:47,685 --> 01:08:51,165
Speaker 10:  but it has to be a filmmaker slash creative person. Someone

1044
01:08:51,585 --> 01:08:55,565
Speaker 10:  who, like, if Christopher Nolan passes or they

1045
01:08:55,565 --> 01:08:59,165
Speaker 10:  choose somebody else, but Christopher Nolan hears who's in charge, he'd

1046
01:08:59,165 --> 01:09:02,405
Speaker 10:  be like, oh, well I kind of wish it was me, but that sounds good to me that

1047
01:09:02,405 --> 01:09:02,885
Speaker 10:  they're in charge.

1048
01:09:03,055 --> 01:09:06,645
Speaker 2:  Right? Real like Dark Night Trilogy, but with James Bond, right. Kinda

1049
01:09:06,965 --> 01:09:10,005
Speaker 2:  situation. And that went, I would say very well for everyone involved, but

1050
01:09:10,005 --> 01:09:13,105
Speaker 2:  it does seem like that that dynamic

1051
01:09:13,975 --> 01:09:17,345
Speaker 2:  just doesn't seem to exist anywhere anymore. I think there was a while where

1052
01:09:18,235 --> 01:09:21,865
Speaker 2:  there were folks out there writing big checks and giving creative control.

1053
01:09:21,865 --> 01:09:24,865
Speaker 2:  Like that's, that was the House of Cards story at the very beginning, a million

1054
01:09:24,865 --> 01:09:27,745
Speaker 2:  years ago. I think Apple was doing that for a while at the beginning. But

1055
01:09:27,745 --> 01:09:31,505
Speaker 2:  we've, we've seen this real retrenchment back

1056
01:09:31,615 --> 01:09:35,025
Speaker 2:  from, we're gonna write big checks to great people to make great things.

1057
01:09:35,085 --> 01:09:38,825
Speaker 2:  And that's gonna make it all work because the theater business has died because

1058
01:09:38,825 --> 01:09:41,425
Speaker 2:  the streaming business has gotten more complicated because its ads. Like,

1059
01:09:41,645 --> 01:09:44,905
Speaker 2:  the thing that worries me the most is it feels like every business incentive

1060
01:09:45,285 --> 01:09:48,745
Speaker 2:  is going to be, we wanna make Infinity

1061
01:09:49,805 --> 01:09:53,505
Speaker 2:  10 episode long miniseries about James Bond

1062
01:09:53,645 --> 01:09:56,785
Speaker 2:  and not a great movie every three years. And that's just the business now

1063
01:09:56,785 --> 01:09:57,825
Speaker 2:  for these companies. Right?

1064
01:09:57,925 --> 01:10:01,665
Speaker 10:  And, and, and I'm sure, you know, I'm sure

1065
01:10:01,685 --> 01:10:05,105
Speaker 10:  inside Amazon in particular, that having numbers and

1066
01:10:05,185 --> 01:10:08,945
Speaker 10:  spreadsheets and, you know, two page memos or whatever their

1067
01:10:09,005 --> 01:10:12,505
Speaker 10:  famous memo length is to back it up with facts

1068
01:10:13,185 --> 01:10:13,665
Speaker 10:  actually works,

1069
01:10:15,525 --> 01:10:19,225
Speaker 10:  or at least works politically inside the company. Right?

1070
01:10:19,545 --> 01:10:21,225
Speaker 10:  I don't know that it works to produce, it

1071
01:10:21,225 --> 01:10:24,065
Speaker 2:  Works when you're selling cloud computing, right? Certainly. Yeah.

1072
01:10:26,365 --> 01:10:30,225
Speaker 10:  And I, I, I think, I think it's about short-term thinking

1073
01:10:30,225 --> 01:10:34,145
Speaker 10:  versus long-term thinking, right? They're not people who are invested

1074
01:10:34,855 --> 01:10:38,665
Speaker 10:  like the broccolis were in thinking, Hey, we're, we're

1075
01:10:38,945 --> 01:10:42,745
Speaker 10:  spending all this money. We have a $400 million budget to make a

1076
01:10:42,745 --> 01:10:46,225
Speaker 10:  fifth movie with Daniel Craig is James Bond, whatever the budget is.

1077
01:10:46,685 --> 01:10:50,305
Speaker 10:  And they're of course, interested in the box office of that movie

1078
01:10:50,575 --> 01:10:54,225
Speaker 10:  when it drops and when it comes out, and what the critical response will

1079
01:10:54,225 --> 01:10:57,945
Speaker 10:  be, and the fact that it's concluding a run

1080
01:10:58,285 --> 01:11:02,145
Speaker 10:  in a, in the role for Craig that they want it to feel like a

1081
01:11:02,145 --> 01:11:05,745
Speaker 10:  capstone to a great reboot of the franchise.

1082
01:11:06,045 --> 01:11:09,825
Speaker 10:  But they're also thinking about the fact that Bond movies get watched

1083
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:14,125
Speaker 10:  10, 20, 30 years from now, right? Like after Barbara

1084
01:11:14,255 --> 01:11:18,205
Speaker 10:  Broccoli's gone, you know, like just the way that her, her dad is

1085
01:11:18,205 --> 01:11:22,165
Speaker 10:  dead, but the movies he made still stand up and are beloved. And

1086
01:11:22,165 --> 01:11:26,085
Speaker 10:  to have somebody who, who has both those goals in mind, you

1087
01:11:26,085 --> 01:11:29,645
Speaker 10:  know, I'm sure there is a short term financial logic to it, you know, and

1088
01:11:29,645 --> 01:11:32,965
Speaker 10:  I'm sure there was with Disney with Star Wars, right? That they're selling

1089
01:11:33,035 --> 01:11:36,885
Speaker 10:  more toys continuously by keeping it in the air con

1090
01:11:36,885 --> 01:11:40,445
Speaker 10:  there, there's always new Star Wars stuff. There's always new Marvel syn

1091
01:11:40,445 --> 01:11:43,925
Speaker 10:  cinematic stuff. Like, and there, it, and it

1092
01:11:44,465 --> 01:11:48,365
Speaker 10:  in some ways, you know, there is an upside to it. It's not all downside,

1093
01:11:48,425 --> 01:11:52,205
Speaker 10:  but it's just different and it's so much more like everything

1094
01:11:52,205 --> 01:11:56,045
Speaker 10:  else as opposed to being something special, right. That Star

1095
01:11:56,075 --> 01:11:59,965
Speaker 10:  Wars is no longer special. Yeah. James Bond movies are still special.

1096
01:12:00,195 --> 01:12:00,885
Speaker 10:  They really are.

1097
01:12:01,235 --> 01:12:04,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it's true. And I, I think it's, it's been, it's an interesting moment

1098
01:12:04,545 --> 01:12:08,005
Speaker 2:  in the Bond franchise because I think part of the reason this happened is

1099
01:12:08,005 --> 01:12:11,845
Speaker 2:  because by all accounts and reporting the franchise

1100
01:12:11,865 --> 01:12:15,765
Speaker 2:  was in total like disarray, they don't have a next bond, right? There's

1101
01:12:15,845 --> 01:12:19,045
Speaker 2:  apparently not a script for a movie. Nobody had agreed on anything. The last

1102
01:12:19,045 --> 01:12:22,965
Speaker 2:  one came out in what, 2021, like three and a half years ago.

1103
01:12:23,275 --> 01:12:23,565
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

1104
01:12:23,565 --> 01:12:27,205
Speaker 10:  Because, and I remember the timing because it was sort of like the,

1105
01:12:28,225 --> 01:12:32,085
Speaker 10:  one of the big blockbusters to sort of reopen

1106
01:12:32,325 --> 01:12:34,245
Speaker 10:  theaters after Covid. That's

1107
01:12:34,245 --> 01:12:37,975
Speaker 2:  Right. I I remember that. That was like, that was the post Covid

1108
01:12:38,065 --> 01:12:41,975
Speaker 2:  movie. It's like Tenant was the, the mid Covid movie. Yeah.

1109
01:12:42,675 --> 01:12:46,415
Speaker 2:  And no time did I, was the post Covid movie Right. Quote unquote post covid.

1110
01:12:48,195 --> 01:12:52,175
Speaker 2:  So, and, and yeah, I think the, the part that gives me hope,

1111
01:12:52,455 --> 01:12:56,375
Speaker 2:  I guess, is that maybe now we can be out of impasse, right? I would

1112
01:12:56,375 --> 01:12:59,015
Speaker 2:  rather have something than nothing. I guess if, if those are the two choices

1113
01:12:59,015 --> 01:13:02,775
Speaker 2:  you're gonna give me, I would rather have meh James Bond

1114
01:13:02,775 --> 01:13:06,735
Speaker 2:  than nothing, I suppose. But then I wonder if that's, that's

1115
01:13:06,735 --> 01:13:09,855
Speaker 2:  the thinking that leads us down this road of problems.

1116
01:13:10,015 --> 01:13:13,055
Speaker 10:  I, I, I guess the way I would put it, and I often come back to this in my

1117
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:16,455
Speaker 10:  writing, that it really matters what, it doesn't just matter what your top

1118
01:13:16,465 --> 01:13:20,255
Speaker 10:  priorities are as an unordered list. It matters what order

1119
01:13:20,255 --> 01:13:24,215
Speaker 10:  they're in. And If you want to, there's a Walt Disney quote that they

1120
01:13:24,215 --> 01:13:27,255
Speaker 10:  put up at Disney World when you're walking around, and they always cover,

1121
01:13:27,395 --> 01:13:31,335
Speaker 10:  you know, if there's a ride that's under construction and they cover

1122
01:13:31,335 --> 01:13:34,895
Speaker 10:  it up so you don't see the construction, and they put inspirational quotes

1123
01:13:34,895 --> 01:13:38,495
Speaker 10:  from Walt Disney. And my favorite one is, I guess I'm

1124
01:13:38,495 --> 01:13:40,575
Speaker 10:  paraphrasing here, but I think I can get it really close.

1125
01:13:42,555 --> 01:13:46,415
Speaker 10:  We don't make movies to make money. We make money

1126
01:13:46,635 --> 01:13:50,375
Speaker 10:  to make more movies. And yes, you want to make,

1127
01:13:50,435 --> 01:13:54,215
Speaker 10:  you want your movies to be profitable and you want your IP to be

1128
01:13:54,215 --> 01:13:58,175
Speaker 10:  profitable, and you want the investment you've made in it to

1129
01:13:58,175 --> 01:14:02,095
Speaker 10:  pay off over time. But the most important thing is to keep the

1130
01:14:02,195 --> 01:14:06,055
Speaker 10:  art as high as possible and make it popular enough

1131
01:14:06,075 --> 01:14:10,055
Speaker 10:  to make money, not to maximize your money. And

1132
01:14:10,055 --> 01:14:13,725
Speaker 10:  secondarily, make the content as good as we possibly can. 'cause of course

1133
01:14:13,725 --> 01:14:16,845
Speaker 10:  that'll keep it going. But if the most important thing is how do we make

1134
01:14:16,905 --> 01:14:20,725
Speaker 10:  the most money from this in the next few years, it's

1135
01:14:20,725 --> 01:14:24,365
Speaker 10:  going to hurt the artistic quality of the output. It's inevitable.

1136
01:14:25,055 --> 01:14:28,905
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Yeah. And it's, and that is the way that most

1137
01:14:28,905 --> 01:14:30,945
Speaker 2:  people seem to be thinking in, in this

1138
01:14:30,945 --> 01:14:32,945
Speaker 10:  Particular long time, right? And there's this whole misnomer, we see it

1139
01:14:32,945 --> 01:14:36,505
Speaker 10:  in tech all the time. I mean, and people, but it, it really isn't true.

1140
01:14:36,695 --> 01:14:40,505
Speaker 10:  It's a philosophy that some people have, but there's no bearing

1141
01:14:40,685 --> 01:14:43,945
Speaker 10:  in law. I wish Neli were here. He could probably, maybe he'd tell me to

1142
01:14:43,945 --> 01:14:46,465
Speaker 10:  go bugger off, and it isn't law, but I'm pretty sure it's not, I've looked

1143
01:14:46,465 --> 01:14:50,345
Speaker 10:  into this, but this notion that publicly

1144
01:14:50,345 --> 01:14:54,105
Speaker 10:  held corporations are under a legal obligation to quote

1145
01:14:54,685 --> 01:14:58,385
Speaker 10:  max maximize profits for shareholders, right?

1146
01:14:58,525 --> 01:15:01,665
Speaker 10:  And that, oh, well, if they make this decision that's sort of bad for the

1147
01:15:01,665 --> 01:15:05,305
Speaker 10:  product, but clearly you can see how it's gonna make the money that people

1148
01:15:05,305 --> 01:15:08,785
Speaker 10:  who want to excuse them say, well, they had to because they're under a legal

1149
01:15:08,875 --> 01:15:12,625
Speaker 10:  obligation to maximize profit for the sh shareholders that there,

1150
01:15:12,625 --> 01:15:13,625
Speaker 10:  there, that's not true.

1151
01:15:14,245 --> 01:15:17,825
Speaker 2:  And well, and Amazon famously for right, for like 15 years,

1152
01:15:17,975 --> 01:15:21,825
Speaker 2:  Jeff Bezos was like, I am going to actively make less money than possible

1153
01:15:22,285 --> 01:15:26,265
Speaker 2:  in order to continue to make this company a success and more valuable.

1154
01:15:26,265 --> 01:15:26,465
Speaker 2:  Right.

1155
01:15:28,245 --> 01:15:31,705
Speaker 2:  Amazon is definitely not that company anymore. But it it is certainly true

1156
01:15:31,705 --> 01:15:34,505
Speaker 2:  that that is a thing you can do If you choose to. Yeah. You can do the right

1157
01:15:34,505 --> 01:15:35,985
Speaker 2:  thing If you want to.

1158
01:15:36,285 --> 01:15:39,265
Speaker 10:  You know, and Tim Cook has talked about that at Apple. There was a thing

1159
01:15:39,265 --> 01:15:43,105
Speaker 10:  like 10 years ago, or in the early years of his CEO's ship

1160
01:15:43,235 --> 01:15:47,105
Speaker 10:  after Steve Jobs had passed, where somebody had asked some,

1161
01:15:47,105 --> 01:15:50,105
Speaker 10:  everybody at their shareholders meeting had questioned the amount of money

1162
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:53,905
Speaker 10:  the company was spending on accessibility. Hmm. And he was like, I don't

1163
01:15:53,905 --> 01:15:57,865
Speaker 10:  care about the bloody ROI and you can just say like, why Tim Cook used the

1164
01:15:57,865 --> 01:16:01,505
Speaker 10:  word bloody is because I think actual American

1165
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:05,305
Speaker 10:  curse word was on the tip of his tongue. And he caught

1166
01:16:05,305 --> 01:16:09,105
Speaker 10:  himself and somehow shifted to the very

1167
01:16:09,105 --> 01:16:12,625
Speaker 10:  unusual for an alabaman bloody Yeah. I

1168
01:16:12,625 --> 01:16:14,305
Speaker 2:  Don't think he's running around saying that in his day to day.

1169
01:16:14,305 --> 01:16:17,105
Speaker 10:  Yeah. But it, you know, by all accounts of that shareholders meeting was

1170
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:20,385
Speaker 10:  very angry, and that it, not every decision they make is going to be about

1171
01:16:20,585 --> 01:16:24,465
Speaker 10:  the return on investment. That there's a long-term view that will

1172
01:16:24,865 --> 01:16:28,585
Speaker 10:  ultimate and that long-term view will maximize long-term

1173
01:16:28,775 --> 01:16:31,265
Speaker 10:  profits. Right. And I think, you know, people looking back

1174
01:16:58,245 --> 01:17:00,145
Speaker 2:  get at us. We have thoughts for you

1175
01:17:00,445 --> 01:17:00,665
Speaker 10:  Or,

1176
01:17:15,165 --> 01:17:16,085
Speaker 10:  a great movie and

1177
01:20:19,325 --> 01:20:21,825
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Let's get to a question from The Vergecast hotline.

Speaker 2:  Thank you as always. Everybody who reaches out this week, we have a question

1182
01:20:36,075 --> 01:20:37,185
Speaker 2:  about face computers.

1183
01:20:39,055 --> 01:20:42,745
Speaker 13:  Hey, it's Mark. I got, I don't know, I'm using a laptop

1184
01:20:42,925 --> 01:20:46,305
Speaker 13:  on a computer table on a desk and I am just

1185
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:50,265
Speaker 13:  unhappy. The laptop screen is so low, I feel like I'm just

1186
01:20:50,265 --> 01:20:54,145
Speaker 13:  cranking my neck down and I'm sick of it. And while external

1187
01:20:54,145 --> 01:20:57,985
Speaker 13:  monitors exist and they're great for desks, I want to be able to move

1188
01:20:57,985 --> 01:21:01,185
Speaker 13:  around, travel, go different places, be in the living room wherever I need

1189
01:21:01,185 --> 01:21:05,065
Speaker 13:  to be office. I don't care what I look like. Can

1190
01:21:05,065 --> 01:21:09,025
Speaker 13:  you help me find something I could put on my face, some type of

1191
01:21:09,025 --> 01:21:12,305
Speaker 13:  glasses that I can connect my MacBook Pro to

1192
01:21:12,845 --> 01:21:16,705
Speaker 13:  and use as a monitor. And obviously the, the Apple Vision

1193
01:21:16,725 --> 01:21:20,665
Speaker 13:  Pro exists, but it seems that the value cur it is just not there. The

1194
01:21:20,665 --> 01:21:23,865
Speaker 13:  value's not there. I'm not paying that much for all of those features that

1195
01:21:23,865 --> 01:21:27,345
Speaker 13:  I don't need when all I need is a really good screen that plugs

1196
01:21:27,935 --> 01:21:30,785
Speaker 13:  into my face. So please help me. Please.

1197
01:21:32,005 --> 01:21:33,585
Speaker 2:  All right. V song is here. Hi Vee.

1198
01:21:34,045 --> 01:21:34,265
Speaker 14:  Hi.

1199
01:21:34,745 --> 01:21:37,585
Speaker 2:  I have never wanted to help anyone as much as I want to help Mark. Oh my

1200
01:21:37,725 --> 01:21:39,305
Speaker 14:  God, mark,

1201
01:21:41,465 --> 01:21:42,625
Speaker 14:  I feel for you so

1202
01:21:42,625 --> 01:21:46,025
Speaker 2:  Much. Yeah, Mark's going through it man. So what do you, what do you think,

1203
01:21:46,025 --> 01:21:49,545
Speaker 2:  where does your head immediate? I have an immediate reaction to this. Where

1204
01:21:49,545 --> 01:21:49,905
Speaker 2:  do you go?

1205
01:21:50,225 --> 01:21:53,545
Speaker 14:  I have one answer for Mark. Okay. And it is the Xreal one glasses.

1206
01:21:54,025 --> 01:21:55,785
Speaker 2:  This is where I went to. Okay, good. This

1207
01:21:55,785 --> 01:21:59,465
Speaker 14:  Is, this is the answer for you Mark. This is actually, I think the only

1208
01:21:59,465 --> 01:22:03,385
Speaker 14:  answer for you, mark because, so what the Xreal one look

1209
01:22:03,385 --> 01:22:07,065
Speaker 14:  like is they just look like a normal pair of glasses from a FAR sunglasses

1210
01:22:07,765 --> 01:22:11,225
Speaker 14:  and then it has USBC, you plug it into anything

1211
01:22:11,615 --> 01:22:15,145
Speaker 14:  that can output video by USBC. So it can be your phone,

1212
01:22:15,605 --> 01:22:19,345
Speaker 14:  it can be your laptop, and then vitamin bing bada boom, we've got an extra

1213
01:22:19,345 --> 01:22:22,625
Speaker 14:  screen in front of you and people will just think you are a giron

1214
01:22:22,935 --> 01:22:26,825
Speaker 14:  indoors wearing sunglasses. But in front of you, you get to see

1215
01:22:26,825 --> 01:22:30,705
Speaker 14:  an ultra wide screen If you so choose to enable the ultra wide or you

1216
01:22:30,705 --> 01:22:34,025
Speaker 14:  get to see a very large screen in front of you that

1217
01:22:34,615 --> 01:22:38,025
Speaker 14:  it's actually surprisingly really good quality. So

1218
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:42,145
Speaker 14:  yeah, I've been testing the Xreal one, which is

1219
01:22:42,145 --> 01:22:45,745
Speaker 14:  their newest series of glasses. They also unveiled the

1220
01:22:45,835 --> 01:22:49,465
Speaker 14:  Xreal one Pro. What makes it pro off the top of my head,

1221
01:22:49,885 --> 01:22:53,695
Speaker 14:  you get some, you know, you know when like someone smacks pro

1222
01:22:53,795 --> 01:22:56,375
Speaker 14:  at the end of something. Yeah. And you get just a little bit extra. It's

1223
01:22:56,375 --> 01:22:59,775
Speaker 14:  that I'm using the regular Xreal ones and

1224
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:03,495
Speaker 14:  I think they're great as is. I think they're about $500.

1225
01:23:04,315 --> 01:23:07,725
Speaker 14:  So you know, a seventh of the price of a vision fro.

1226
01:23:08,035 --> 01:23:11,725
Speaker 14:  Yeah. And it basically is going to extend your screen for you.

1227
01:23:12,595 --> 01:23:15,885
Speaker 14:  It's not going to like hide your screen, your laptop screen is still gonna

1228
01:23:15,885 --> 01:23:19,685
Speaker 14:  be on, but you can just look up and not have to crank your neck down. You

1229
01:23:19,685 --> 01:23:23,485
Speaker 14:  can look up and type. So yeah, just crank

1230
01:23:23,565 --> 01:23:27,525
Speaker 14:  your font up. My eyes are like really bad ing so

1231
01:23:27,605 --> 01:23:31,485
Speaker 14:  whenever I'm typing in it, like I, I was, I was slacking a message

1232
01:23:31,505 --> 01:23:34,925
Speaker 14:  to you David earlier in the Xreal ones and I was like, oh Jesus, I can't

1233
01:23:34,925 --> 01:23:38,645
Speaker 14:  read this thing to, because my eyes are notoriously bad. So I had to just

1234
01:23:38,645 --> 01:23:42,205
Speaker 14:  like be a really old lady and crank up the font to like

1235
01:23:42,365 --> 01:23:45,805
Speaker 14:  150 and I was like, oh, now I can read this comfortably. And you can like

1236
01:23:45,805 --> 01:23:49,005
Speaker 14:  adjust the, the distance of like the virtual monitor so you can put it further

1237
01:23:49,035 --> 01:23:53,005
Speaker 14:  back If you have better vision or put it real up close like

1238
01:23:53,005 --> 01:23:56,925
Speaker 14:  me, right? 'cause I'm blind, so Yeah. Extra one.

1239
01:23:57,075 --> 01:23:57,565
Speaker 14:  Okay. So

1240
01:23:58,045 --> 01:24:01,685
Speaker 2:  I, I think you're right, but I just wanna talk this out a little bit. Okay.

1241
01:24:01,805 --> 01:24:04,645
Speaker 2:  I went to exactly the same place that that you did, which I think suggests

1242
01:24:04,645 --> 01:24:08,405
Speaker 2:  that this, this is probably the right answer. I think we, we can

1243
01:24:08,405 --> 01:24:11,805
Speaker 2:  dispense with the Vision Pro immediately because it's $3,500 and it's really

1244
01:24:11,805 --> 01:24:15,685
Speaker 2:  heavy and it's just like for this, this thing that you want it

1245
01:24:15,685 --> 01:24:19,165
Speaker 2:  is wildly overkill and also like not

1246
01:24:19,415 --> 01:24:21,965
Speaker 2:  ideal because it's really heavy on your face and it's 3,500

1247
01:24:22,225 --> 01:24:25,645
Speaker 14:  And just not portable because Mark says he wants it to be portable. So I'm

1248
01:24:25,765 --> 01:24:29,725
Speaker 14:  assuming that he occasionally wants to go to a coffee shop. And If you wanna

1249
01:24:29,725 --> 01:24:33,565
Speaker 14:  go to a coffee shop, please don't bring your fish in Pro. I just

1250
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:37,765
Speaker 14:  Fair. Yeah, it's, it, the travel case is not that portable.

1251
01:24:38,225 --> 01:24:41,965
Speaker 2:  Is it possible though that a meta quest could be the answer?

1252
01:24:43,235 --> 01:24:47,205
Speaker 14:  It's possible. I have tried doing work in a meta quest before and

1253
01:24:47,205 --> 01:24:51,045
Speaker 14:  come across similar issues. Not in the sense that it's more

1254
01:24:51,045 --> 01:24:54,605
Speaker 14:  comfortable, but I just find it just disorienting

1255
01:24:54,915 --> 01:24:58,565
Speaker 14:  because I don't know, you don't really have peripheral

1256
01:24:58,565 --> 01:25:02,325
Speaker 14:  vision in a, in a quest. So If you are out in public,

1257
01:25:03,345 --> 01:25:07,085
Speaker 14:  you Mark says he doesn't care what he looks like. And I love that for Mark,

1258
01:25:07,225 --> 01:25:10,325
Speaker 14:  but I think you will care even less if people

1259
01:25:10,825 --> 01:25:14,245
Speaker 14:  aren't staring at you. 'cause I feel the stares when people stare at me.

1260
01:25:14,355 --> 01:25:18,045
Speaker 14:  Yeah. I just feel like you'll be more comfortable and honestly a little

1261
01:25:18,045 --> 01:25:21,165
Speaker 14:  safer because you never know who's a whack job out there just

1262
01:25:21,985 --> 01:25:23,965
Speaker 14:  taking pictures of you like that's

1263
01:25:24,345 --> 01:25:26,685
Speaker 2:  Fun or stealing your laptop while you're not looking at it or

1264
01:25:26,765 --> 01:25:29,845
Speaker 14:  Stealing your laptop while you're not looking at it because you are in a

1265
01:25:29,845 --> 01:25:33,795
Speaker 14:  headset. I just, I don't think really we're at a place

1266
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:37,715
Speaker 14:  where the headsets make sense for productivity no matter what the big tech

1267
01:25:37,715 --> 01:25:41,395
Speaker 14:  people say like gaming. Sure. Like

1268
01:25:42,215 --> 01:25:45,975
Speaker 14:  I think the meta quest is great in terms of like how lightweight it is.

1269
01:25:46,125 --> 01:25:47,815
Speaker 14:  It's much more comfortable than the Vision Pro.

1270
01:25:49,575 --> 01:25:53,215
Speaker 14:  I find it looks really grainy in there anyway though. So that's not my favorite

1271
01:25:53,305 --> 01:25:57,255
Speaker 14:  thing. So I think in terms of screen resolution, listen,

1272
01:25:57,575 --> 01:26:01,535
Speaker 14:  I watched Stray Kids videos in, in the X reel to test and I

1273
01:26:01,535 --> 01:26:05,245
Speaker 14:  was like, oh, my boys, my sons, my K-pop sons,

1274
01:26:05,245 --> 01:26:08,405
Speaker 14:  they're in such high resolution, I love this. So,

1275
01:26:09,195 --> 01:26:12,885
Speaker 2:  Okay. Yeah. So, and then the other thing I'm trying to figure out is there

1276
01:26:12,885 --> 01:26:16,205
Speaker 2:  are basically two ways to do a screen in front of your face, right? One is

1277
01:26:16,345 --> 01:26:20,245
Speaker 2:  the like standard Xreal thing where it's just, it's

1278
01:26:20,245 --> 01:26:23,805
Speaker 2:  just a display in front of your eyes and when your eyes move, the display

1279
01:26:23,805 --> 01:26:27,165
Speaker 2:  moves with your eyes, right? Like that's very straightforwardly. This is

1280
01:26:27,165 --> 01:26:29,725
Speaker 2:  the thing that Xreal and a couple of others have been doing for a while.

1281
01:26:30,705 --> 01:26:33,805
Speaker 2:  The other one, and I think this is the difference when you get into like

1282
01:26:33,805 --> 01:26:36,805
Speaker 2:  the pro universe is you get the sort of three degrees of freedom where I

1283
01:26:36,805 --> 01:26:40,685
Speaker 2:  can like leave the screen over there. Yeah. Or, or kind

1284
01:26:40,685 --> 01:26:44,485
Speaker 2:  of have it exist in like anchored in physical space around

1285
01:26:44,485 --> 01:26:47,845
Speaker 2:  me, even though it's a virtual screen. And I'm trying to think if I'm just

1286
01:26:47,925 --> 01:26:51,435
Speaker 2:  a person trying to use my computer, which of those is

1287
01:26:51,655 --> 01:26:55,615
Speaker 2:  better? Because on the one hand, like my screen exists in

1288
01:26:55,655 --> 01:26:59,015
Speaker 2:  a, in a space and if I move my head, my screen stays over here.

1289
01:26:59,435 --> 01:27:03,055
Speaker 2:  So that sort of tracks with real world. But also if, if I'm wearing these

1290
01:27:03,055 --> 01:27:06,375
Speaker 2:  glasses so that I can look at my screen, actually being able to turn my head

1291
01:27:06,375 --> 01:27:08,975
Speaker 2:  and still be looking at my screen might be a good thing.

1292
01:27:09,485 --> 01:27:11,775
Speaker 14:  Yeah. I think, do you know what I mean? I think that is a good thing. I,

1293
01:27:11,895 --> 01:27:15,655
Speaker 14:  I do appreciate that about the Xreal and there's a button you can

1294
01:27:15,785 --> 01:27:18,655
Speaker 14:  press that we'll just turn them into normal glasses in case you have to

1295
01:27:18,755 --> 01:27:22,175
Speaker 14:  see what actually is going on around you. So that's not so bad.

1296
01:27:23,515 --> 01:27:27,335
Speaker 14:  My thing is, is if you're actually working, typing in the headsets is

1297
01:27:27,935 --> 01:27:31,495
Speaker 14:  a bitch, there's no way around it. Yeah. Unless you have your peripherals

1298
01:27:31,495 --> 01:27:34,775
Speaker 14:  with you and I mean If you're connecting to a laptop, you can just use a

1299
01:27:34,775 --> 01:27:38,575
Speaker 14:  laptop's keyboard, that's totally fine. But it's just not

1300
01:27:38,655 --> 01:27:41,815
Speaker 14:  a comfortable experience is what I would say. So if you're doing long-term

1301
01:27:41,845 --> 01:27:45,575
Speaker 14:  work, I find a pair of glasses easier to wear for

1302
01:27:45,815 --> 01:27:49,695
Speaker 14:  a longer period of time. If you're trying to do deep work. The one thing

1303
01:27:49,855 --> 01:27:53,735
Speaker 14:  I do find that the pro headsets have an advantage over is you could make

1304
01:27:54,055 --> 01:27:57,775
Speaker 14:  that screen so big. True. If you ever really wanna feel

1305
01:27:57,845 --> 01:28:01,775
Speaker 14:  existential dread in a draft, just make it, make the screen the size of

1306
01:28:01,775 --> 01:28:05,215
Speaker 14:  your wall stare at it and just go like, why won't the words come?

1307
01:28:05,675 --> 01:28:05,895
Speaker 14:  Ah,

1308
01:28:06,045 --> 01:28:08,975
Speaker 2:  Have you ever done that? That is like sadistic I've done. I'm gonna look

1309
01:28:08,975 --> 01:28:12,615
Speaker 2:  at every word that I have written for this story six feet across.

1310
01:28:12,765 --> 01:28:13,215
Speaker 2:  That sounds

1311
01:28:13,215 --> 01:28:17,015
Speaker 14:  Awful. I have done that. It is awful. I will tell you I've done that.

1312
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:20,615
Speaker 14:  I've just like full screened, a full screened

1313
01:28:20,855 --> 01:28:24,815
Speaker 14:  CMS stared at it and just gone like, wow, I've made a life choice

1314
01:28:25,235 --> 01:28:29,055
Speaker 14:  and wow, I really don't like the structure

1315
01:28:29,195 --> 01:28:33,055
Speaker 14:  of this graph. What if we just delete it? So I

1316
01:28:33,055 --> 01:28:36,975
Speaker 14:  have done that not frequently. Mostly when I was testing just to like

1317
01:28:36,975 --> 01:28:40,545
Speaker 14:  torture myself. Because why not? Why not?

1318
01:28:41,745 --> 01:28:44,625
Speaker 14:  I will say that if you're doing a lot of writing though, you really gotta

1319
01:28:44,625 --> 01:28:48,305
Speaker 14:  crank up the font in the X reels. Hmm. And it's not my favorite

1320
01:28:48,485 --> 01:28:52,145
Speaker 14:  to write in. It is a lot better if you're doing

1321
01:28:52,815 --> 01:28:56,425
Speaker 14:  just casual media viewing, but you can do it

1322
01:28:57,245 --> 01:29:00,145
Speaker 14:  and as long as you're not looking at 40,000 Excel cells,

1323
01:29:01,125 --> 01:29:04,725
Speaker 14:  I think you should be fine. Like if you're just making a deck, blow the

1324
01:29:04,725 --> 01:29:08,205
Speaker 14:  deck up, you'll be fine. It's great if you're doing like

1325
01:29:08,765 --> 01:29:12,525
Speaker 14:  a draft where there's hundreds of tiny little words, just

1326
01:29:12,615 --> 01:29:16,565
Speaker 14:  crank it up to 180 and then you can read comfortably instead

1327
01:29:16,565 --> 01:29:20,325
Speaker 14:  of squinting in your glasses and going like, ugh. Yeah. That's, that's the

1328
01:29:20,325 --> 01:29:21,445
Speaker 14:  only thing I'll say. You do

1329
01:29:21,445 --> 01:29:23,965
Speaker 2:  Make an interesting point about the resolution though. 'cause there is, there

1330
01:29:23,965 --> 01:29:27,565
Speaker 2:  is a certain kind of like number

1331
01:29:27,595 --> 01:29:31,325
Speaker 2:  crunching spreadsheeting work that I would say no one

1332
01:29:31,325 --> 01:29:34,685
Speaker 2:  should do in a headset of any resolution. Correct. Because it'll, it'll,

1333
01:29:34,685 --> 01:29:38,645
Speaker 2:  it'll just destroy your eyes and brain trying to make sense of

1334
01:29:38,645 --> 01:29:38,965
Speaker 2:  all of it.

1335
01:29:39,315 --> 01:29:40,845
Speaker 14:  Also your soul also your

1336
01:29:40,845 --> 01:29:42,085
Speaker 2:  Soul also also your soul. Yeah. Nothing

1337
01:29:42,465 --> 01:29:42,885
Speaker 14:  You'll

1338
01:29:42,885 --> 01:29:45,365
Speaker 2:  Just be like, like If you wanna see the Excel numbers bigger, you're in real

1339
01:29:45,365 --> 01:29:48,965
Speaker 2:  trouble. But I think Yeah, yeah. There's like part of me

1340
01:29:49,415 --> 01:29:52,485
Speaker 2:  hears Mark and is like, mark, what you need is not glasses. What you need

1341
01:29:52,485 --> 01:29:56,125
Speaker 2:  is one of those cool foldy stands that just moves your laptop

1342
01:29:56,305 --> 01:29:56,925
Speaker 2:  up higher. I

1343
01:29:56,925 --> 01:30:00,645
Speaker 14:  Was also gonna suggest that I was like, mark, mark, what if we, what if

1344
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:04,485
Speaker 14:  we, I think Welch took a picture of a guy one time in a coffee shop

1345
01:30:04,505 --> 01:30:08,285
Speaker 14:  who just had like seven books stacked on top of each other and the laptop

1346
01:30:08,305 --> 01:30:11,085
Speaker 14:  on top of it and was just happy as a clam working.

1347
01:30:12,805 --> 01:30:16,685
Speaker 14:  I, we will say you probably have seven books in your bookcase Mark If

1348
01:30:16,685 --> 01:30:20,645
Speaker 14:  you wanna try that then before you shell out $500

1349
01:30:20,825 --> 01:30:24,725
Speaker 14:  for a pair of smart glasses face computers. But If you

1350
01:30:24,725 --> 01:30:28,365
Speaker 14:  are gonna go the face computer out, I really do think the Xreal one is probably

1351
01:30:29,075 --> 01:30:32,995
Speaker 14:  your only option. There might be a, there

1352
01:30:32,995 --> 01:30:36,195
Speaker 14:  might be like other competitors that I just haven't tried yet, but as far

1353
01:30:36,195 --> 01:30:40,115
Speaker 14:  as one that I have gotten my hands on, put on my face and

1354
01:30:40,115 --> 01:30:44,035
Speaker 14:  feel comfortable recommending, I would say the Xreal, they have

1355
01:30:44,475 --> 01:30:47,795
Speaker 14:  multiple options in multiple price ranges. But the ones that I have used

1356
01:30:48,255 --> 01:30:51,755
Speaker 14:  and can say has a pretty good screen resolution is the Xreal one.

1357
01:30:52,225 --> 01:30:56,115
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And I think in a case like this, if you're se like I, I was

1358
01:30:56,115 --> 01:30:58,635
Speaker 2:  just looking at extra's website 'cause I, I've tried a few of these and it's

1359
01:30:58,635 --> 01:31:02,115
Speaker 2:  like you can get the thing that you're describing, which is screen in front

1360
01:31:02,115 --> 01:31:05,875
Speaker 2:  of your face for less than the price of the one. But I

1361
01:31:05,875 --> 01:31:09,835
Speaker 2:  also think if you're gonna use this thing as hard as it sounds like our,

1362
01:31:09,835 --> 01:31:12,875
Speaker 2:  our buddy Mark is gonna use it. Yeah. You should pay for the extra resolution.

1363
01:31:12,875 --> 01:31:16,635
Speaker 2:  Like it's your, your eyes will thank you If you just

1364
01:31:16,725 --> 01:31:20,155
Speaker 2:  spend a little bit more to get the one that looks the best you possibly can

1365
01:31:20,585 --> 01:31:24,275
Speaker 14:  That, and especially If you like, wanna watch a video privately

1366
01:31:24,375 --> 01:31:25,075
Speaker 14:  on the way back.

1367
01:31:25,345 --> 01:31:25,635
Speaker 2:  True

1368
01:31:25,745 --> 01:31:29,555
Speaker 14:  Commuting. Like that's, I'm telling you the stray kids,

1369
01:31:29,655 --> 01:31:33,275
Speaker 14:  the the makeup resolution was really great and I was just like, they're

1370
01:31:33,275 --> 01:31:36,755
Speaker 14:  so beautiful. I love this. I love watching my

1371
01:31:37,035 --> 01:31:40,835
Speaker 14:  effeminate sons from a different country dance, complicated

1372
01:31:40,875 --> 01:31:42,955
Speaker 14:  choreography and technicolor. It's great.

1373
01:31:43,055 --> 01:31:45,115
Speaker 2:  And they're doing it just for you because that's the glasses,

1374
01:31:45,115 --> 01:31:47,475
Speaker 14:  They're doing it just for me because they're on the glasses. No one can,

1375
01:31:47,895 --> 01:31:51,395
Speaker 14:  no one can see me watch a million tiktoks of the Justin

1376
01:31:51,505 --> 01:31:54,595
Speaker 14:  Baldoni Blake Lively case. It's just for me. So,

1377
01:31:54,815 --> 01:31:55,995
Speaker 2:  And now for all of us, that's,

1378
01:31:55,995 --> 01:31:57,595
Speaker 14:  That's on top of that. And now for all of

1379
01:31:57,595 --> 01:32:00,475
Speaker 2:  Us. But that's, it's just, we won't tell anybody. Don't worry. Just

1380
01:32:00,715 --> 01:32:03,475
Speaker 14:  I am, I've watched way too many tiktoks about that case,

1381
01:32:04,815 --> 01:32:06,315
Speaker 14:  so I'm glad that it's private.

1382
01:32:07,665 --> 01:32:08,555
Speaker 2:  It's, it's for the best.

1383
01:32:09,065 --> 01:32:09,795
Speaker 14:  It's for the best

1384
01:32:10,435 --> 01:32:12,195
Speaker 2:  V Thank you Mark. I hope that helps.
