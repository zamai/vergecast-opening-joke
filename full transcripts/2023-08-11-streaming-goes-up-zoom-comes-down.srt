2
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,680
Speaker 3:  Hollywood writers and actors are still striking and one of the things

3
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,600
Speaker 3:  they're fighting against is AI swooping in and taking their jobs.

4
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,280
Speaker 3:  But truth is AI is already all over Hollywood.

5
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,720
Speaker 4:  You know Harrison Ford has come out and said that

6
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,760
Speaker 4:  he not only is okay with the de aging process that was

7
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,200
Speaker 4:  used in the most recent Indiana Jones, but he thought it was skillfully

8
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,120
Speaker 3:  Done. The fight over AI in TV and film This

9
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,920
Speaker 3:  week on Intuit. Vultures Pop culture podcast.

10
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,750
Speaker 5:  Hello and Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of integrating

11
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,590
Speaker 5:  apps into five g a plan. That totally worked. And

12
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,350
Speaker 5:  now we live in a utopia of robot surgery and video conferencing.

13
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,270
Speaker 5:  David, what's Utopia like? We're

14
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,710
Speaker 6:  The flagship podcast of all of that.

15
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,350
Speaker 5:  Yeah, the whole thing.

16
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,350
Speaker 6:  It's a lot to be the flagship podcast of,

17
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,870
Speaker 5:  It's a big concept. There's not a lot of competition in the space. And

18
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,710
Speaker 5:  that's, that's business baby. You gotta find, find,

19
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,910
Speaker 5:  you gotta find your, your niche. I'm your friend. Neli. David. Pierce is

20
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,030
Speaker 5:  here.

21
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,870
Speaker 6:  Hi, I I too am integrated into five g

22
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,430
Speaker 5:  Alex. Cranz is here. Alex is in San Francisco.

23
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,790
Speaker 7:  Yeah, I'm in San Francisco. Wondering like, who isn't integrated into five

24
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,790
Speaker 7:  G At this point. Come on guys, get it together.

25
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,190
Speaker 5:  I saw in one of the trade publications, I saw a headline that was like, the

26
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,950
Speaker 5:  hottest thing in five G isn't public, five G networks. And then

27
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,830
Speaker 5:  what is it? It's private five G like obviously the other things. Sure.

28
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,590
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So they've, they've given up on us, the lowly

29
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,350
Speaker 5:  public and your private five G network for

30
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,230
Speaker 5:  warehouse operations is where the money is. And I just want to go

31
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,990
Speaker 5:  back in time and like show people that headline in meetings like

32
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,350
Speaker 5:  you are lying.

33
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:43,670
Speaker 6:  The hottest thing in public five G is still slightly faster.

34
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,710
Speaker 6:  Netflix downloads in the airport before you get on the plane,

35
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,750
Speaker 5:  Which isn't bad. It's like, I don't hate it. It's something. But we could've

36
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,470
Speaker 5:  just, we could've just fixed the wifi networks in the airport. I think we

37
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:53,790
Speaker 5:  would've gotten

38
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,310
Speaker 6:  It. There's that.

39
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,630
Speaker 5:  Anyway, this is not the flagship podcast of any of that, although I promise

40
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,480
Speaker 5:  you there'll be a slight amount of telecom five G Dunking

41
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,520
Speaker 5:  in this episode of the verse cast. That's what we do here every

42
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,240
Speaker 7:  Episode. Yeah.

43
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,440
Speaker 6:  As is our right.

44
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,720
Speaker 5:  A lot talk about this week, a bunch of Streaming news this week. Slack had

45
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,080
Speaker 5:  a redesign. We have some reader emails, which are always fun.

46
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,640
Speaker 5:  There's some CarPlay news to get into. Got a

47
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,120
Speaker 5:  MrBeast update. There's just like a lot going on like a, like a summer grab

48
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,760
Speaker 5:  bag. But like we did last week, we want to begin by just getting the

49
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,840
Speaker 5:  Elon News out of the way. We, we know you like

50
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,470
Speaker 5:  it even though you, you tell us you don't like it. I don't know how to

51
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,310
Speaker 5:  describe the exact phenomenon. You tell us

52
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:41,230
Speaker 5:  loudly. You hate it in the comments of the posts that you have clicked on.

53
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,470
Speaker 5:  Read to the Bottom and then left comments on It is,

54
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,590
Speaker 5:  it is a weird dynamic, but we know You know you want it. So David, can

55
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,270
Speaker 5:  you just give us quickly all of the Elon news this week that's worth talking

56
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,510
Speaker 5:  about?

57
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,400
Speaker 6:  Sure. Okay. Here, here is everything I've compiled

58
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,960
Speaker 6:  that has happened this week. That matters.

59
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:08,680
Speaker 6:  All right. That's it.

60
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,040
Speaker 6:  That help everybody feel good.

61
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,080
Speaker 5:  It's beautiful. That's all the news in the world of Elon that is actually

62
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,920
Speaker 5:  worth noting this week. Just a dull roar

63
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,600
Speaker 5:  of noise. And that's where we are this week with Elon. So that's good. The

64
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,120
Speaker 6:  Only actual Elon thing I'll say is that Casey Newton wrote a very good

65
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,400
Speaker 6:  issue of platformer that we also ran on The Verge about how we talk about

66
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,320
Speaker 6:  Elon. That I thought was very good and very instructive and people should

67
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,000
Speaker 6:  go read that. Yep.

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,080
Speaker 5:  It's on the site. It's on platform Mark. Go read it. Case is great. Okay,

69
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,800
Speaker 5:  let's talk about national news. We've been sort of talking at this moment

70
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,720
Speaker 5:  in Streaming, the two strikes that are going on, the interlocking

71
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,640
Speaker 5:  strikes between the writers and the actors. Bob Iger had gave

72
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,160
Speaker 5:  an interview to C N B C A while ago that set everything astray.

73
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,160
Speaker 5:  Then there were some news that said the writers are coming back to the table

74
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,840
Speaker 5:  at the studios. Disney had earnings, which were really revealing. Alex, what

75
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,280
Speaker 5:  is going on in the world of Streaming?

76
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,960
Speaker 7:  Well I think the big thing is Disney's hiking the price of Hulu

77
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,600
Speaker 7:  and Disney Plus, but only the

78
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,600
Speaker 7:  ad-free version. So if you're already paying 7

79
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,400
Speaker 7:  99 a month for the ads, you're fine.

80
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,440
Speaker 7:  Keep enjoying all of those beautiful ads. If you were like me trying

81
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,400
Speaker 7:  to avoid the ads, the prices have gone up. Disney Plus is now

82
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,120
Speaker 7:  gonna cost 1399 and then

83
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,480
Speaker 7:  Hulu no ads is gonna cost 1799. But if

84
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,960
Speaker 7:  you wanna keep both, you can just pay 1999. Oh

85
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,200
Speaker 7:  boy, And I. Think the streamers were looking out in the world and they were

86
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,200
Speaker 7:  thinking, okay, how can we make this pricing scheme make sense? And they

87
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,120
Speaker 7:  just looked to like cell phone providers. Like

88
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,840
Speaker 7:  that's my best guess. 'cause it's just like caught confusing garbage.

89
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:53,520
Speaker 7:  Can

90
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,280
Speaker 6:  I just say there's a table in the story we wrote about the price

91
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,840
Speaker 6:  hike that lays out the different prices that you can pay for

92
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,760
Speaker 6:  Disney's various Streaming services. And it is like deranged

93
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,400
Speaker 6:  how complicated this is. If you want Disney plus, there's two options. If

94
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,320
Speaker 6:  you want Hulu, there's four options including one that is ans

95
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,960
Speaker 6:  espn plus with Hulu add-on No boy, which I guess is also Hulu if you want

96
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,200
Speaker 6:  ESPN plus there's three other ones. If you want bundle offerings, there's

97
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,120
Speaker 6:  three other ones. And if you just want Hulu with plus live tv, there's two

98
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,080
Speaker 6:  other ones. So basically you have like 400,000 different ways to

99
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,840
Speaker 6:  get all of Disney's content, but it's abundantly clear.

100
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,520
Speaker 6:  Alex, correct me if I'm wrong, that the thing Disney would really like you

101
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,880
Speaker 6:  to do is pay 7 99 and watch ads.

102
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:42,040
Speaker 7:  Yeah. 'cause why have a Streaming service when you

103
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,880
Speaker 7:  can just have a couple of cable channels where you don't have to

104
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,800
Speaker 7:  deal with cable carriers? Like if I'm, if I'm a business person,

105
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,800
Speaker 7:  that makes a lot of sense to be, if I'm a person who wants anything to be

106
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,280
Speaker 7:  nice and effortless and work smoothly, it makes no sense. But,

107
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,160
Speaker 7:  but like the business case makes a lot of sense. And I hate it because it

108
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,800
Speaker 7:  makes so much sense. But yeah, we're just kind of like back to cable

109
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:08,120
Speaker 7:  again. Yeah. But we have to do it all ourselves. Which is, I mean, that was

110
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,800
Speaker 7:  the point, right? Like that was the, that was the initial promise of this.

111
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,120
Speaker 7:  All right. Like we were gonna cut our cables and then we were gonna be really

112
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,640
Speaker 7:  happy because we could just choose And. I would never have to pay for E S

113
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,120
Speaker 7:  P N. Again.

114
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,400
Speaker 5:  What I'm learning now in my old age is that by making everyone

115
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,040
Speaker 5:  pay for everything, we subsidized a lot of the niche stuff. Yeah. So

116
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,680
Speaker 5:  everyone that was forced to pay for E S P N, that made them a

117
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,960
Speaker 5:  lot of money. Just a, a lot of money that they could then subsidize a lot

118
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,720
Speaker 5:  of stuff with

119
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,920
Speaker 6:  Like the Disney channel,

120
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,440
Speaker 5:  Right? And then when you break it all up and you say, everyone pay for exactly

121
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,160
Speaker 5:  what you want, it turns out like that's

122
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,520
Speaker 7:  Expensive.

123
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,440
Speaker 5:  Everyone will pay for exactly what they want and everything will make smaller.

124
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,400
Speaker 5:  Like the pie will stay the same size, but it'll have more slices.

125
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,480
Speaker 5:  And that's not great. And so it's very clear they're trying to get back to,

126
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,360
Speaker 5:  okay, you pay for access to this, the advertisers will come in. 'cause the

127
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,040
Speaker 5:  advertisers will spend a lot of money and that'll give us the

128
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,920
Speaker 5:  margin to go subsidize all the other stuff. It's not clear if that's gonna

129
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,800
Speaker 5:  work either, but that's just very much where they would like to go back to.

130
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,560
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Yeah. I mean it, it is deeply hilarious to me

131
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,800
Speaker 6:  how quickly we're going back to it should just be like

132
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,640
Speaker 6:  cable but better. And it's like if, if you could just go back 20 years

133
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,720
Speaker 6:  and be any of these big cable providers, and if they were just like, what

134
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,560
Speaker 6:  if we just let people pick the shows they wanted to watch and changed nothing

135
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,440
Speaker 6:  else, they would've just dominated the universe for

136
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,320
Speaker 6:  forever. Because it turns out that's all people actually wanted. Like I just

137
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,800
Speaker 6:  want to choose what show is on turned out to be the only behavior anybody

138
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,240
Speaker 6:  actually wanted to change. Everything else was like pretty all right in most

139
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,120
Speaker 6:  cases. Well, there was,

140
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,040
Speaker 7:  There was a sports agnostic folks like

141
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,880
Speaker 7:  who didn't wanna have to pay for E S P N and now I don't have to. Yeah.

142
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,680
Speaker 6:  But all the people who watched E S P N were paying for the Disney channel

143
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,720
Speaker 6:  and Nickelodeon and all of the other stuff on your TV that got

144
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,720
Speaker 6:  funded by the fact that E S P N made so much money, right? Like E S P N

145
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,080
Speaker 6:  was such a cash cow for Disney that it funded all this other stuff. And so

146
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,000
Speaker 6:  it's just like, in a way, this system like didn't make any sense, but

147
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,880
Speaker 6:  actually seems like it kind of worked except that cable was bad and expensive.

148
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:12,520
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Oh,

149
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,360
Speaker 5:  I'm saying look, every like 15 years or so, there's like a lawsuit from someone

150
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,520
Speaker 5:  who's like, my taxes go to the military, And I don't want my taxes to go

151
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,800
Speaker 5:  to the military. And then they lose. That was

152
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,640
Speaker 7:  Us. That was us

153
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,040
Speaker 5:  Esp. It's like, and then like the lawsuit goes and the court's like, nah,

154
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,720
Speaker 5:  that's not how taxes work. Like Right. You pay your taxes, you go, everyone

155
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,320
Speaker 5:  gets decide. That's E S P N E S P N is the military industrial

156
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:36,200
Speaker 5:  complex. Yeah. And we, the American consumers should be forced to pay our

157
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,080
Speaker 5:  taxes because that subsidizes like the 35th show

158
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,080
Speaker 5:  on the Disney channel. Right. And that's how that's gonna work. Well,

159
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,400
Speaker 6:  And it's like, do You know how that, like your Google Maps knows where you

160
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,280
Speaker 6:  are? Like, thank the military for g P s being a thing. Right. It's like it

161
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,280
Speaker 6:  turns out like all this stuff is connected a little more than

162
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,200
Speaker 5:  You think. So, but this is like Disney had earnings, right? And their earnings

163
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,080
Speaker 5:  are mixed bag, it's earnings are never that interesting to talk about.

164
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,200
Speaker 5:  But they lost a bunch of subscribers in India because they lost the rights

165
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,080
Speaker 5:  to cricket. So Disney Plus is coming back down to Earth, but

166
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,760
Speaker 5:  the parks are doing well, and it's just unclear what new

167
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,880
Speaker 5:  content they will have because of the strikes

168
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,120
Speaker 5:  Iger notably was like, I hope we can figure this out this time.

169
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,480
Speaker 5:  Whereas a few months ago, he was like, I'm very disturbed by these sick bastards.

170
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,640
Speaker 5:  You know. Like the tone has shifted a little bit

171
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,200
Speaker 5:  and it just seems clear. Like Disney, they've got a, they've gotta

172
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:36,160
Speaker 5:  power through this moment and actually have stuff worth buying and watching.

173
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,000
Speaker 5:  And it's sort of unclear what that stuff is gonna be.

174
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,680
Speaker 7:  Well, and that's, that's part of this too, is like you think, okay, they,

175
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,600
Speaker 7:  they did Disney, Disney Plus and Marvel was supposed to be a big

176
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,640
Speaker 7:  subscriber. Like the main reason people subscribe to Disney Plus is 'cause

177
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,560
Speaker 7:  they have children. But everybody who doesn't have children, myself included,

178
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,880
Speaker 7:  we wanna like, why would we wanna go subscribe? And the idea was, okay, well

179
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,200
Speaker 7:  you're gonna subscribe for Star Wars and you're gonna subscribe for Marvel,

180
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,480
Speaker 7:  and then all those shows are kind of garbage.

181
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:07,560
Speaker 6:  Yeah. It sounded like a pretty compelling argument. And even at the beginning

182
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,680
Speaker 6:  it was pretty good. Like Wand Visions was great. Yeah. The Mandalorian was

183
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,680
Speaker 6:  great. It was like, it started well, and then just over the course of the

184
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,640
Speaker 6:  next few years, they just systematically got worse. Right. As all the other

185
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,880
Speaker 6:  factors got harder for Disney. And so it's just like this perfect storm of

186
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,840
Speaker 6:  like, what is the pitch here? And it seems to get harder and harder

187
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,200
Speaker 6:  all the time.

188
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,080
Speaker 7:  Like you could not get, pay people to care about

189
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,000
Speaker 7:  Secret Invasion, which was the, the latest Marvel show. I, I watched all

190
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,240
Speaker 7:  of it.

191
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,880
Speaker 7:  I know what happened. Do I ever wanna talk with anyone else about

192
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,000
Speaker 7:  it?

193
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,760
Speaker 5:  You're like, no. Barely wanna admit that you watch the show. Here's my

194
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,200
Speaker 5:  understanding of secret invasion. Just to be clear, I have not watched it.

195
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,960
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I've barely paid attention to it. It's the show where everyone is

196
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,480
Speaker 5:  revealed to be an alien so that they can recast new actors in those roles,

197
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,120
Speaker 5:  the next movies. Yeah. I

198
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,360
Speaker 7:  Mean, and that kind of like, that's a big part of it. Okay. And it's,

199
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,080
Speaker 5:  But my sense of it is, the reveal in every episode is this beloved

200
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,240
Speaker 5:  character has always been an alien. Yeah.

201
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,160
Speaker 7:  It's like this person is secretly an alien. The

202
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,600
Speaker 6:  Show is just like, it's like an intermission between Marvel things. They're

203
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,080
Speaker 6:  just like, here's we're, we're going to reboot the show over

204
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:18,280
Speaker 6:  seven Yeah. Different episodes. And then at the end of it, new

205
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,600
Speaker 6:  Avengers. Yeah. Basically.

206
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,160
Speaker 5:  It

207
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,480
Speaker 7:  Was so

208
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,440
Speaker 5:  Bad. Like, it, it seems it's cynical on its face. Like just even

209
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,360
Speaker 5:  I know that much about it, which I don't even think that's spoilers, like

210
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,200
Speaker 5:  the show's called Secret Invasion, I think Yeah. It, that's what it is on

211
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,160
Speaker 5:  the Tint You know, like, I don't think I spoiled anything about this show

212
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:40,040
Speaker 5:  for anyone, but it, it's like, oh, we need some new actors. So

213
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,440
Speaker 5:  what if all the old actors are revealed to be aliens and then they get in

214
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,320
Speaker 5:  a spaceship and go back to their home planet. It's like, oh, this is, you

215
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,840
Speaker 5:  guys are really out of ideas here. Like, you're starting over. I think they,

216
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,200
Speaker 5:  oh, they now that's a spoiler Alex now that people are gonna use this.

217
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,360
Speaker 7:  Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Nevermind guys. So,

218
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,360
Speaker 5:  But the big picture here is just generally across the

219
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,800
Speaker 5:  Streaming market, Disney has these problems. They're gonna start doing some

220
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,760
Speaker 5:  Netflix news, right? They're gonna actively explore cracking down on password

221
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,160
Speaker 5:  sharing, which seems to have worked really well for Netflix. They keep

222
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,760
Speaker 5:  gesturing at the idea of selling themselves to Apple.

223
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,680
Speaker 7:  This. Okay. Okay. I wanna, like, this is, this is what I wanna call, I wanna

224
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,040
Speaker 7:  use, I'm gonna drop a a curse word here. This is utter bullshit. This happens

225
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,080
Speaker 7:  like every time Apple is one of those companies that has a ton of money and

226
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,680
Speaker 7:  they always have a ton of cash around, right? And so everybody's like, oh,

227
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,560
Speaker 7:  what should they do with it? And like six, seven years ago, I was like, they

228
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,400
Speaker 7:  should buy Netflix. Yeah. And they were never gonna buy Netflix because that

229
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,160
Speaker 7:  doesn't make sense.

230
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,360
Speaker 6:  First of all, they absolutely should have bought Netflix.

231
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,200
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It would've been great then, but they were never going to because it

232
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,560
Speaker 7:  didn't make sense. And the idea that they were gonna go and like Tim Cook,

233
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:45,880
Speaker 7:  who's entire thing is like making money by being really smart about logistics

234
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,720
Speaker 7:  is gonna take on the cruise and the theme park

235
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,520
Speaker 7:  industry. Tim cook's about to retire. Like he doesn't

236
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,200
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That's why you buy Disney at the end and you're like, look, Bob Iger,

237
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,760
Speaker 5:  you hate retiring. Yeah. Have you thought of being the c e o of here you

238
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,440
Speaker 5:  go, I bought Disney. You just, I'm gonna, I'm Tim Cook, here's

239
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:03,840
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

240
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,960
Speaker 7:  Now you go and do all the keynotes.

241
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:10,040
Speaker 5:  My swan song is headsets and cruises together at last, and,

242
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,440
Speaker 5:  and then he just rides off in the the sunset. That's

243
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,760
Speaker 7:  A very like retiree swan song

244
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,760
Speaker 5:  On a horse made of money. This is the future of cruises is you get on

245
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,680
Speaker 5:  and you put on your Apple Vision Pro on your Disney cruise, and you

246
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,520
Speaker 5:  sit in a recliner,

247
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,840
Speaker 6:  But you're not actually on a boat at all. You're just

248
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,520
Speaker 5:  At home. Well you're, you're, you're in a sound stage that rocks. You

249
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,840
Speaker 7:  Have a little Mickey assistant. This is

250
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,400
Speaker 5:  By the way, the plot of Wally. So a little worried,

251
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,400
Speaker 5:  but at least at the end, You know they save Earth.

252
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,880
Speaker 6:  I don't know. So the Disney apple thing has always seemed suspicious

253
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,120
Speaker 6:  to me. Like to the point where it's, I I I have always agreed with you Alex

254
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:49,320
Speaker 6:  that this is like a thing people say because it sort of seems like it makes

255
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,280
Speaker 6:  sense, but never was actually real. But the two things that happened this

256
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,520
Speaker 6:  week that I thought were very interesting were Kim Masters at the Hollywood

257
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,280
Speaker 6:  Reporter, who is very much like a person who knows everything about what's

258
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,160
Speaker 6:  happening in Hollywood wrote a one of those stories that is

259
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,000
Speaker 6:  like half reported and half speculative, but it's only speculative because

260
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,640
Speaker 6:  you can't say out loud the things that other people have said to you that

261
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,320
Speaker 6:  You know for sure. Right. Like reading between the lines. This thing is like

262
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,320
Speaker 6:  very accurate and very well sourced about, basically,

263
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,360
Speaker 6:  hypothetically, if you were Disney, here is what you would do if you wanted

264
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,040
Speaker 6:  to sell your company to Apple. You would divest, you would pull the different

265
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,680
Speaker 6:  pieces apart and you would essentially turn yourself into a company

266
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:30,560
Speaker 6:  full of characters and IP without a lot of stuff

267
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,520
Speaker 6:  attached to it. And then you would sell that to Apple. And then you look

268
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,640
Speaker 6:  around and, oh, that's exactly what Bob Iger kind of sounds like he wants

269
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,040
Speaker 6:  to do with Disney. And so that happened.

270
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,560
Speaker 6:  The piece is very good. It's, we have it linked on The Verge, we should put

271
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,400
Speaker 6:  it in the show notes too. Like Kim is is a person who knows things.

272
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,680
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And I. I trust, I, I don't think Kim is like making this up out of

273
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,640
Speaker 6:  whole cloth. And then the other thing was, somebody on Disney's earnings

274
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,560
Speaker 6:  call asked Bob Iger directly something to the effect

275
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,440
Speaker 6:  of, are you selling to Apple? And his answer was,

276
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,920
Speaker 6:  he said, basically, I'm not gonna say anything. It's not something that we

277
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,760
Speaker 6:  have obsessed about. And then he said, obviously anyone who wanted to speculate

278
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,920
Speaker 6:  about these things would have to immediately consider the global regulatory

279
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,360
Speaker 6:  environment. And then he said, I'll say no more than that. How do you not

280
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,800
Speaker 6:  read that as, gosh, I'd really like to, but Lehan and the FTC

281
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,960
Speaker 6:  super, super, super would not allow it to happen. Like, I don't know how

282
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,080
Speaker 6:  else to read that statement from Bob Liger.

283
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,560
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And I think that's, that goes back to the, the fact that this isn't

284
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:32,800
Speaker 7:  gonna happen. I mean, theoretically it could, right? Like, like,

285
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,480
Speaker 7:  like I'm, I don't wanna say it's never gonna happen, but it's very unlikely

286
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,360
Speaker 7:  to because the EU would come down on that new combined

287
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,360
Speaker 7:  company and just, just destroy it. Yes. Like they

288
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,320
Speaker 7:  would never allow it to happen. And it would be just borderline

289
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,200
Speaker 7:  unconscionable for the F T C to let two of the biggest companies, the company

290
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,680
Speaker 7:  that has like a practical monopoly in the theater space,

291
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:59,480
Speaker 7:  practical monopoly in all these other spaces, and the company that has the

292
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,040
Speaker 7:  App store monopoly combine into one mega company.

293
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:07,400
Speaker 7:  Like that's bad business unless you're Bob Iger.

294
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,240
Speaker 5:  All right, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna make the argument do

295
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:10,360
Speaker 5:  it.

296
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,360
Speaker 7:  Okay. Be

297
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,200
Speaker 5:  Bob, I'm coming back to Disney as C e o.

298
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,400
Speaker 7:  Wow. Congratulations.

299
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:18,680
Speaker 5:  The first thing Bob Iger says in every room, look, I was leaving, but

300
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,200
Speaker 5:  I'm coming back now. Here's the argument. I have two arguments to make. One

301
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,520
Speaker 5:  is like a straightforward argument. We kinda went through this with Microsoft

302
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,320
Speaker 5:  and Activision and eventually the EU caved and the Ft C lost and like

303
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,360
Speaker 5:  whatever, right? Like it is the same shape of thing, right? The

304
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,240
Speaker 5:  big distribution platform buys a bunch of content. We seem

305
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,880
Speaker 5:  to not know how to stop it. It just happens. Fine.

306
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,120
Speaker 5:  Maybe it will just happen. I don't know if it will, but obviously Bob Iger

307
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,720
Speaker 5:  is thinking about the global regulatory environment. Then there's, I think

308
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:51,720
Speaker 5:  what I would frame as the chaos argument, which is

309
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,440
Speaker 5:  let them dance. You know, like this is how companies fall apart,

310
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:00,480
Speaker 5:  is like they get too big. Yeah. And then this thing seems

311
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,640
Speaker 5:  unmanageable and like Apple's corporate culture

312
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,080
Speaker 5:  will crush Disney. And then maybe we'll be free

313
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,600
Speaker 5:  You know. It's like, that's like, it's the, it's the worst argument I can

314
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,800
Speaker 5:  make. It is I will say the argument that, for example,

315
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,200
Speaker 5:  has proven to be correct in the case of every at t acquisition in history.

316
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,240
Speaker 5:  But Fi Go ahead. Buy Time Warner. Try to try to rule

317
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:25,760
Speaker 5:  the world.

318
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:29,720
Speaker 6:  Yeah. I mean, I was gonna say a o l Time Warner is exactly this kind of

319
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,560
Speaker 6:  merger that you're describing also. Yeah.

320
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,480
Speaker 5:  And it's like, yeah, go ahead. Try. Like see, see if that works out for you.

321
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,160
Speaker 5:  See if, see if you are not destroyed by your own hubris, I'm not saying that's

322
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,200
Speaker 5:  a great policy outcome. Many, many people lose their jobs along the way

323
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,000
Speaker 5:  and lots of art doesn't get made. Although with Time Warn and at and

324
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,720
Speaker 5:  t we did get the Gray Scale four by three Justice League.

325
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,040
Speaker 5:  So that happened.

326
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:57,080
Speaker 7:  We're gonna get like a Marvel movie just shot all vertically. So it fits

327
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,480
Speaker 7:  perfectly on your iPhone and profile. That's what you're getting. Yeah.

328
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,320
Speaker 5:  I mean look, I I, I'm not saying they should or shouldn't do it. I just think

329
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,120
Speaker 5:  that like if I'm Tim Cook, I'm looking at the history of

330
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,840
Speaker 5:  these kinds of integrations and I'm saying, oh actually in the end,

331
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,240
Speaker 5:  this never works out. Like it doesn't matter about the regulators. Like

332
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,080
Speaker 5:  if you are a smart business person, you look at integrations of this size

333
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,200
Speaker 5:  and you're like, oh,

334
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,730
Speaker 5:  this is death. Like this is what kills both companies in like

335
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,010
Speaker 5:  meaningful ways At the end of the road.

336
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,010
Speaker 7:  He's told people no in the past. Right? Like, wasn't there the one where

337
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,050
Speaker 7:  Elon was like, please buy Tesla. Before Tesla was Tesla. Yeah. And he was

338
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:36,210
Speaker 7:  like, l o l get out of my office. How did you get in here? Actually,

339
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:40,390
Speaker 5:  Speaking of things that should have bought right? Like the many,

340
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:44,350
Speaker 5:  many, many attempts that Apple has made to make a car. Yeah. It

341
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,390
Speaker 5:  should have just bought Tesla. Yeah. Yes. They would've solved the panel

342
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,910
Speaker 5:  gaps, I'll tell you that much.

343
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,990
Speaker 5:  They wouldn't have cheaped outta the materials.

344
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,510
Speaker 6:  There just would be no door handles at all. Your whole

345
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,750
Speaker 7:  Hand goes in those panel gaps.

346
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,870
Speaker 6:  Yeah. But this is the thing that comes up every time the like possibility

347
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:05,830
Speaker 6:  of Apple acquiring some sexy company comes up. Like, do you remember a

348
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,590
Speaker 6:  couple of years ago when Peloton was flagging and everybody was like, oh,

349
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,230
Speaker 6:  Apple's gonna buy Peloton. And then there were a couple of people, I think

350
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,590
Speaker 6:  including our friend Steve Kovac at C N B C, who just

351
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,550
Speaker 6:  basically raised their hand and were like, why on earth would Apple want

352
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,390
Speaker 6:  Peloton? Like why all these companies need Apple? Makes a lot of sense.

353
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,190
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Why Apple need the richest company on

354
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:31,070
Speaker 6:  the planet that has done a very good job of developing the ability to do

355
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:34,990
Speaker 6:  almost anything very well over time. Why on earth would it

356
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:38,830
Speaker 6:  need like a warehouse full of treadmills and bikes that no one is

357
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:42,750
Speaker 6:  buying? Yeah. And in this case, like what does Apple need with a theme park?

358
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:47,070
Speaker 5:  I mean, they run a very nice theme park in Cupertino. It's a circle

359
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,760
Speaker 5:  the way. Yeah. It's a, i I I guess like a, the basic business

360
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,720
Speaker 5:  advice is like, don't buy problems. You know. Like yeah, this is a huge

361
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,440
Speaker 5:  problem. Like the future of Streaming is a huge problem. Apple's involved

362
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,240
Speaker 5:  in these strikes, right? They are part of the A M P T P. Yeah.

363
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:07,280
Speaker 5:  They're up against sag. They're up against the Writer's Guild Disclosure

364
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:10,960
Speaker 5:  Alex is part of the Writer's Guild. Our newsroom is unionized with the Writer's

365
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,280
Speaker 5:  Guild. I'm a Netflix producer. Comcast owns a chunk of the company. You should

366
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,400
Speaker 5:  watch our Netflix show. It's great.

367
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,560
Speaker 6:  That was your best one yet. That was like all in one breath. That was really

368
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,040
Speaker 6:  good. Whew.

369
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,920
Speaker 5:  Someone wrote to us and said, your disclosures are starting to sound like

370
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,920
Speaker 5:  flexes. So I'm trying to, but it is true that I'm a Netflix producer.

371
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,520
Speaker 5:  You should watch your Netflix show. That's great. It was nominated for an

372
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,240
Speaker 5:  Emmy. Oh, so

373
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,240
Speaker 6:  You've, you've mech for your other podcast Now. Do you wanna

374
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,480
Speaker 5:  Disclose that? Oh yeah. You can go to store@themerch.com and buy, buy literally

375
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,560
Speaker 5:  my name on a hat. So that's a weird moment for me

376
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,600
Speaker 5:  personally.

377
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,480
Speaker 5:  That's all just really complicated for Apple. And this is like their first

378
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,560
Speaker 5:  baby step in the water, right? They're not like a huge distributor of TV

379
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,440
Speaker 5:  shows. Buying Disney is like now they're in it. Yeah.

380
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,880
Speaker 5:  Like they're fully in. Like let's a good example. Jason Klar took over

381
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,760
Speaker 5:  for at Time Warner, right? He took over Warner Media and he was like, here's

382
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,680
Speaker 5:  the thing we wanna do. All the movies are gonna go to Streaming Day and Date.

383
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:09,160
Speaker 5:  That is a thing that Apple would want to do to promote Apple TV plus on their

384
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,440
Speaker 5:  devices. And that thing broke. Warner Media pushed

385
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:17,080
Speaker 5:  Klar out of the c e o role and we ended it with Discovery Max

386
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,040
Speaker 5:  plus whatever it's called. Those are culture decisions that

387
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,880
Speaker 5:  you have to make. They're not business decisions. And, I. Think Apple likes

388
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,440
Speaker 5:  being at a remove the thing that I would offer and,

389
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,600
Speaker 5:  and we have an entire episode about sports and Streaming coming next week,

390
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:35,040
Speaker 5:  but Apple's really into sports. Yep. And I think they really wanna do sports

391
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,560
Speaker 5:  in the Vision Pro in like a serious way. E S P N over the past couple months

392
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:42,000
Speaker 5:  and in particular last week, just sort of like casually rearranged the sports

393
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,840
Speaker 5:  media market. Yeah. Right. They took Pat McAfee who was

394
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:49,640
Speaker 5:  kind of the, one of the biggest indie sports podcasters

395
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,160
Speaker 5:  video people. He had a deal with FanDuel Disney just

396
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:57,280
Speaker 5:  took him away. He, I think he was unhappy with that FanDuel deal. He's now

397
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,440
Speaker 5:  just part of the E S P N lineup. Like big, huge

398
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,400
Speaker 5:  multimillion dollar deal. And then this last week, Penn

399
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,040
Speaker 5:  Gaming, which was another betting company, heavily invested in Barstool sports.

400
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,920
Speaker 5:  A lot of machinations there. But they basically just gave it back to Dave

401
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,960
Speaker 5:  Portnoy, who is a controversial character in his own right. And said, you

402
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,400
Speaker 5:  can have Barstool, we're going with Disney, we're going with espn. Wow. And

403
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,800
Speaker 5:  e, ESPN opened up to betting for the first time in partnership with Penn.

404
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,880
Speaker 5:  So just in like the last few months, E S P N has just like

405
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,160
Speaker 5:  repositioned some of the biggest indie names in sports media and entered

406
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:34,160
Speaker 5:  betting. That's all just a lot. Right. That and that those are power

407
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:37,320
Speaker 5:  moves. Like yeah. This is how E S P N wants it to be. This is how e ESP n

408
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,240
Speaker 5:  is gonna get it. That puts E S P N in the driver's

409
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,000
Speaker 5:  seat of kinda the next turn of things maybe. But

410
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,600
Speaker 5:  it's not clear that Apple wants to be in like the betting business at all.

411
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:49,440
Speaker 5:  Right?

412
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,840
Speaker 6:  No, I would say it seems overwhelmingly likely that Apple doesn't want to

413
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,000
Speaker 6:  be in that business. Like to the extent that like betting apps are in the

414
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,720
Speaker 6:  App store seems to be only headache for Apple. Yeah. And, I can't imagine

415
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,640
Speaker 6:  them signing up for the, the regulatory complications that

416
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,360
Speaker 6:  come with that anytime soon. And I think like to your, to your point about

417
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:11,560
Speaker 6:  getting into this world fully, even with

418
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:15,760
Speaker 6:  TV plus, apple has been sort of dragged kicking and screaming into the

419
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,400
Speaker 6:  broader Hollywood landscape. Like it, it had to commit to spending a bunch

420
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,720
Speaker 6:  of money to put its movies in theaters. It's slowly

421
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,000
Speaker 6:  becoming more of a part of Hollywood. But even still, like

422
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,560
Speaker 6:  Apple's whole thing is, it likes things that can wrap its arms entirely around.

423
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:34,040
Speaker 6:  And even if you own Disney, you just can't do that. Yeah. So

424
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,720
Speaker 6:  like I can see what Disney would want from Apple out of some You know

425
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:41,920
Speaker 6:  partnership. What's the phrase everybody uses? Special relationship that,

426
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:45,920
Speaker 6:  that they had with jobs because Jobs owned Pixar. Yeah. And there was some,

427
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,440
Speaker 6:  he was

428
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,640
Speaker 5:  The largest shareholder of Disney. It wasn't a special relationship. He was

429
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,960
Speaker 5:  the largest individual shareholder of Disney. Yeah. Right. So he was like,

430
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,960
Speaker 5:  I can call them. And they picked up the phone. Yeah.

431
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,880
Speaker 6:  He and Bob had like a special handshake that they did. Yeah. And they would

432
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,520
Speaker 6:  like do butterfly kisses when they saw each other. And that's, that was the

433
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,560
Speaker 6:  Disney Apple relationship.

434
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:10,080
Speaker 6:  But yeah, I, I'm, I tend to be with you Cranz that this won't happen.

435
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,920
Speaker 6:  But I do think it is possible that we will get to a point where both companies

436
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,480
Speaker 6:  want it to happen, but ultimately decide they can't.

437
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,840
Speaker 6:  Yeah. For a variety of reasons. We

438
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,240
Speaker 7:  Were hearing those rumors a couple of weeks ago that they might get rid of

439
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,280
Speaker 7:  E S P N, they might sell Elf E S P N or something like that, that I

440
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,200
Speaker 7:  could maybe see happening. But even then it's back to like, does Apple

441
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,600
Speaker 7:  wanna get into gambling and also doing sports deals? Yeah.

442
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,880
Speaker 7:  Probably not. It's

443
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,080
Speaker 6:  It's a mess. I

444
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,920
Speaker 5:  Think they wanna do sports deals, not gambling. Go ahead.

445
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,640
Speaker 6:  I was just gonna say, can we get a real quick strike update before we throw

446
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,560
Speaker 6:  a break and move on from this stuff? 'cause I feel like a bunch of this stuff

447
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,320
Speaker 6:  came up in these earnings calls and people are back at the table, but not

448
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,520
Speaker 6:  back at the table. So it's,

449
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,160
Speaker 7:  It's all negotiations, which means everybody's gonna have their

450
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,120
Speaker 7:  own opinion on who's the one stepping back. Right now the

451
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,720
Speaker 7:  Writer's Guild is saying, well, it's the producers. They're not coming to

452
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,760
Speaker 7:  the table. They refuse to come to the table. And the producers are like,

453
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,880
Speaker 7:  Uhuh, we're here. And so it's not clear. There's still

454
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,480
Speaker 7:  definitely a lot of like, discourse there and, and people upset with each

455
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,200
Speaker 7:  other. But the, the Emmys have been delayed because

456
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,330
Speaker 7:  of the strikes, right? Because like, you can't have a bunch

457
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,690
Speaker 7:  like it. What good are the Emmys if You don't have a bunch of actors up on

458
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:26,290
Speaker 7:  stage being like, yay, I want an Emmy. Like it's, it's just the technical

459
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,930
Speaker 7:  Emmys and those are really good, but they haven't televised those for years,

460
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:33,170
Speaker 7:  so I don't think we're gonna start now. And so you've got that

461
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,930
Speaker 7:  Paramount just, just came out and was like, well, we are totally set. We

462
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:40,770
Speaker 7:  we are, we are, we, we are refined. We can weather continue to weather this.

463
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:44,240
Speaker 7:  And this is where I'm super suspicious of other companies who were like,

464
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:47,320
Speaker 7:  yeah, I just don't know if we're gonna have all the content we need. Because

465
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:51,240
Speaker 7:  they all knew this, these strikes were coming. They all knew this was

466
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,920
Speaker 7:  going to be happening. They've all been banking shows for, for a while

467
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,880
Speaker 7:  now to get through this. So any of 'em who say, well, I didn't know

468
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,800
Speaker 7:  and everything be super suspicious there. Like, take a moment, look around

469
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,680
Speaker 7:  and be like, is that true? Because it's, it's certainly

470
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,240
Speaker 7:  interesting and everybody's gonna keep doing this. This is gonna be like,

471
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,040
Speaker 7:  there's always, you're gonna have both sides expressing their truth,

472
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:16,920
Speaker 7:  which is certainly the truth, but it's also specifically their

473
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,440
Speaker 7:  versions of it. So You know, maybe Disney doesn't have

474
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,880
Speaker 7:  enough content to get them through. They could bring Willow back

475
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:29,160
Speaker 7:  instead of yanking it off of Disney Plus after a few months, I'm fine.

476
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,520
Speaker 7:  I'm not bitter. It's okay. Oh,

477
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,880
Speaker 5:  This is how we get back, girl. Back on on Max. I see it. Yeah.

478
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:37,440
Speaker 7:  This is how we get it back. They're like, oh my God, this actually will make

479
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,400
Speaker 7:  us more money. The tax break saved us.

480
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,160
Speaker 5:  It's interesting. I'll just note and then we, then we should take a break.

481
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:47,160
Speaker 5:  The last time there was a rider strike, that's when reality TV

482
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,040
Speaker 5:  happened. Mm.

483
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,360
Speaker 7:  Well it was happening right before it.

484
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:53,560
Speaker 5:  Right. And the studio started investing in it and massively 'cause it was

485
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,120
Speaker 5:  cheaper. And then it became this like dominant form of media.

486
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:00,520
Speaker 7:  That's what a lot of 'em are planning on doing. Like a lot of 'em are gonna

487
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:04,600
Speaker 7:  carry through with that. But at the end of the day, especially 'cause

488
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,320
Speaker 7:  the actors are on strike, like you still want people like to see famous people.

489
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,840
Speaker 7:  That's just the way it is. They wanna see the famous people and the famous

490
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,680
Speaker 7:  people are all out picketing or staying in their houses going Yeah, you

491
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,560
Speaker 7:  go picketers and like Ven Mowing the Strike Fund occasionally.

492
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:19,960
Speaker 7:  Yeah.

493
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,600
Speaker 5:  Will Smith is like, get my weird AI double from that bad movie that we shot

494
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,240
Speaker 5:  in one 20. Get him on the on the line. I still, I can barely

495
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,360
Speaker 5:  remember that movie. It's called the Gemini Man. Get the Gemini man out there.

496
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:30,840
Speaker 5:  Yeah. Right now,

497
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,200
Speaker 6:  Gemini man two, three and four are all coming next year.

498
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:39,160
Speaker 5:  Yeah. If we don't solve this AI Will Smith is coming to your house.

499
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,120
Speaker 7:  That's the real threat.

500
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,160
Speaker 5:  Well, no, it's just like it was last time, it was reality. This time it's

501
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,800
Speaker 5:  gonna be, oh, what if we show you even more South Korean game shows and like

502
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,360
Speaker 5:  that's gonna be a weird, it's gonna be a weird thing to look at a few years.

503
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,360
Speaker 5:  Shout out this isn't get resolved soon is all I'm saying.

504
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,800
Speaker 7:  Netflix is gonna have a great time because they have a huge international

505
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,960
Speaker 7:  library. So they're, they're like set Paramount set.

506
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,400
Speaker 7:  Disney's the one. I'm kind of surprised that they weren't set because you

507
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,040
Speaker 7:  would think Hulu is definitely set. But yeah, we'll see. I

508
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,240
Speaker 6:  Don't know. After only murders in the building season three, like what is

509
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,200
Speaker 6:  there on Hulu?

510
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:10,760
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

511
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:11,880
Speaker 6:  For anyone.

512
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,520
Speaker 7:  The little fire show with Reese Witherspoon that I never watched but I know

513
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:15,840
Speaker 7:  exists.

514
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:20,320
Speaker 6:  Love that. The Little fires one. Everybody's favorite show for your

515
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,640
Speaker 6:  consideration for the Emmy.

516
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,320
Speaker 5:  All that's enough. We will note here just to the end, Barbie

517
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,240
Speaker 5:  is over a billion at the box office. Hell yes. Without any

518
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:33,760
Speaker 5:  Ryan Gosling. Margot Robbie promotion 'cause they're on strike too, which

519
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,560
Speaker 5:  is also fascinating. And probably everyone's gonna learn the wrong lesson

520
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,840
Speaker 5:  from that. Okay, that's it. We gotta take a break. We'll be right back.

521
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,690
Speaker 3:  Basically the more I talk through this with y'all, the more I am

522
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,410
Speaker 3:  perplexed. I do not know.

523
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,410
Speaker 10:  This week on Unexplainable, we're bringing you a new episode of our game

524
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,410
Speaker 10:  show, unexplainable or not. And we've got three potential

525
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,450
Speaker 10:  mysteries. Mystery one

526
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:03,570
Speaker 3:  Oh,

527
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,650
Speaker 10:  Mystery two.

528
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,770
Speaker 3:  Oh that's so cute.

529
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,170
Speaker 10:  And Mystery three.

530
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:13,170
Speaker 3:  Oh my God. Stop. I should have been a scientist.

531
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:18,570
Speaker 10:  Our guest this week is Sam Sanders, host of Vultures Intuit podcast.

532
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:22,810
Speaker 3:  I'm good at some things. I'm not particularly good at science things,

533
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,050
Speaker 3:  but I love to talk.

534
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,050
Speaker 10:  Sam's gonna try to guess which of these mysteries are still mysteries

535
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:34,010
Speaker 10:  and which one has actually recently been solved.

536
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,250
Speaker 3:  I'm scared, I don't know if I'm right or wrong

537
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:40,090
Speaker 10:  To find out. Follow Unexplainable for new episodes every Wednesday.

546
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:17,060
Speaker 5:  AI to Streaming platform shifts to privacy. No one knows exactly

547
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:20,580
Speaker 5:  where we're headed, but Code is where the world's most influential people

548

552
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,740
Speaker 5:  We're back in a hard transition from the state of Streaming. We're now gonna

553
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,780
Speaker 5:  talk about enterprise software.

554
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,060
Speaker 6:  Yes, the two most important things,

555
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:47,580
Speaker 5:  David.

556
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:53,700
Speaker 5:  David, you wrote about Slack's redesign this week. A lot going on in Slack.

557
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:56,020
Speaker 5:  It's turning into teams in a lot of ways.

558
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:59,460
Speaker 6:  Yeah, basically it's, it's a sort of delightful story because

559
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:03,980
Speaker 6:  teams spent several years during the pandemic just ruthlessly

560
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:07,620
Speaker 6:  copying everything it could about Slack and then just sort of

561
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:11,620
Speaker 6:  decimating it because you get teams for free by subscribing to Microsoft's

562
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:15,540
Speaker 6:  many other products. Slack is a separate thing you have to pay for. So teams

563
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:19,500
Speaker 6:  sort of resoundingly won by just copying Slack. And

564
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,620
Speaker 6:  now Slack, which got bought by Salesforce as a

565
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:27,620
Speaker 6:  half success story, half sort of retrenchment after being destroyed by

566
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,980
Speaker 6:  teams is now just completely copying teams.

567
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,180
Speaker 6:  So they've added a new sidebar where there's like the home

568
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:38,260
Speaker 6:  feed where that kinda looks like Slack. But then there's also a DMS thing

569
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:41,920
Speaker 6:  where you can see all your messages from all across Slack. There's an activity

570
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,640
Speaker 6:  thing that'll show you every time you've been mentioned or there are reaction

571
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,600
Speaker 6:  emojis, all that stuff. It's basically like they're trying to sort of filter

572
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:52,000
Speaker 6:  your messages a little better so you can make more sense of the chaos of

573
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,400
Speaker 6:  Slack. And also make it easier for you to find things like

574
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:59,360
Speaker 6:  huddles and canvas and some of these other features that they have. In

575
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,200
Speaker 6:  general, the idea makes total sense to me. I think a lot of

576
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,440
Speaker 6:  people are gonna freak out because it does look pretty different and it's

577
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,120
Speaker 6:  a really different way of thinking about Slack. Like Slack, I don't know

578
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,520
Speaker 6:  how you guys feel about it. It's pure chaos, but it is like an

579
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,920
Speaker 6:  understandable kind of chaos. And, I think

580
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,800
Speaker 6:  shifting. That is tough, especially for something like this. It's like people

581
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,680
Speaker 6:  use this stuff for work all day, every day. And the idea of just like we've

582
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,280
Speaker 6:  put in a new icon always freaks people out. Yeah,

583
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:29,040
Speaker 5:  It's understandable. Okay. That's 'cause most things in Slack are the same

584
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,120
Speaker 5:  kind of thing. Yeah,

585
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:33,400
Speaker 6:  It's messaging. It's just a bunch of messages in a row, right?

586
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,840
Speaker 5:  It's a, here's a line of text that You know it's like sent to someone or

587
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,720
Speaker 5:  some room and at worst maybe you'll like send someone a line of text in the

588
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,600
Speaker 5:  wrong context and that's bad. Great. But like it's all the same thing.

589
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:48,600
Speaker 5:  And what's happening now with this redesign is like

590
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:52,400
Speaker 5:  many more kinds of things are gonna come to the front like huddles

591
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,720
Speaker 5:  and the canvas thing, which is like a Google doc for a room.

592
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,600
Speaker 5:  And that's the term that I, I think they've wanted to make for a long time.

593
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:04,560
Speaker 5:  Like this is where we work and work involves lots of different

594
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,200
Speaker 5:  kinds of communication and context versus this is where you send lines of

595
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,800
Speaker 5:  text to other people and we will see,

596
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:15,600
Speaker 5:  whereas teams we, we had a long conversation about teams in like The,

597
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,480
Speaker 5:  Verge team, Slack room because Teams is much bigger,

598
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:23,520
Speaker 5:  like an order of magnitude more users than Slack. Yeah.

599
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:27,520
Speaker 5:  And it is mostly in big companies used as a video conferencing

600
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,720
Speaker 5:  application, not any of the other stuff.

601
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:33,600
Speaker 7:  Yeah. A lot of 'em still use Slack for like dms

602
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:37,160
Speaker 7:  and stuff and then they use teams for their video conferences. Which

603
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:37,640
Speaker 5:  Is bizarre.

604
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:41,160
Speaker 6:  Which is insane for like a bunch of reasons. Yeah.

605
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,800
Speaker 7:  The IT guy's just like, I got money to spend, man, I'm having a great time.

606
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:48,680
Speaker 7:  Like blowing that whole budget. Enjoy yourself IT guys,

607
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:53,040
Speaker 5:  If you're not watching the video, Alex just made the like make it rain motion

608
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,720
Speaker 5:  with her hands to describe an IT administrator buying Slack.

609
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:04,200
Speaker 7:  You already got themes out there and he's just throwing money around. She,

610
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,640
Speaker 7:  they, the

611
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,520
Speaker 5:  Thong songs playing Alex is like buying enterprise software.

612
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:09,960
Speaker 7:  Woo.

613
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,520
Speaker 7:  That's how I, that's how like as a lover of enterprise software.

614
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,600
Speaker 7:  That's how I think about it.

615
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,840
Speaker 5:  We'll see, I well I haven't gotten the new Slack update yet. David, are you

616
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,160
Speaker 5:  using it?

617
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,520
Speaker 6:  I haven't gotten it yet either. It's gonna roll out slowly. Slack always

618
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,480
Speaker 6:  says is really slowly, they're like desperately afraid of making

619
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,120
Speaker 6:  people nervous about changes. So you can like opt in to being

620
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:35,960
Speaker 6:  fast or medium or slow and how you get updates. I think it's coming to free

621
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:39,640
Speaker 6:  users first because like Slack doesn't care about you if you don't give them

622
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,240
Speaker 6:  money. So just deal with the new thing and then sort of slowly to everybody

623
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,120
Speaker 6:  else. I'm very curious about it. But the reason I added it to the rundown,

624
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,160
Speaker 6:  and we don't have to spend too long on this, but I think it's really interesting.

625
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,960
Speaker 6:  We, we had this debate ironically in Slack

626
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:55,880
Speaker 6:  after this story went up about why people care about Slack

627
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,240
Speaker 6:  so much. Hmm. Like just to let people into how The Verge works. I've written

628
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,080
Speaker 6:  about Slack a lot over the years and every time a ton of

629
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,040
Speaker 6:  people read it in a way that if I write about like a new feature in Google

630
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:10,760
Speaker 6:  Docs or Excel or these other, like

631
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:15,410
Speaker 6:  in many cases, much more popular features. Like sometimes they're like

632
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:19,330
Speaker 6:  big new things. But in every case, like a teeny tiny iterative update to

633
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:23,290
Speaker 6:  Slack, people care about a lot. And. I. I have been trying to

634
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:27,250
Speaker 6:  figure out why this is for a long time. Like what is it about Slack

635
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:31,010
Speaker 6:  that means this much to people in a way that like your

636
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:34,930
Speaker 6:  average app you use at work doesn't really matter.

637
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:39,390
Speaker 5:  I think it's 'cause people use Slack for their friends and

638
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:43,630
Speaker 5:  most enterprise software is just like not used that way. Like that's,

639
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:47,390
Speaker 5:  that's just my thing is like you live in Slack for like

640
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:51,510
Speaker 5:  a lot of things you do with other people. If you have a d

641
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:54,550
Speaker 5:  and d group, there's a chance you have a Slack, maybe you have a Discord,

642
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:55,790
Speaker 7:  We have a signal. Thank you.

643
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,550
Speaker 5:  Right. Like but so many people just have slacks for

644
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:04,230
Speaker 5:  things outside of work. Yeah. And, I think that that means

645
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,630
Speaker 5:  like everyone's just kind of interested. Like here's this interface I have

646
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:10,750
Speaker 5:  for communities on the internet that is changing or

647
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:14,070
Speaker 5:  You know. The Slack just captured so much of the imagination to begin with

648
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:18,190
Speaker 5:  that everyone is interested like remains interested in it. But like Zoom

649
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,230
Speaker 5:  isn't that thing no one reads about when we do Zoom updates. No. Unless they're

650
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:22,910
Speaker 5:  stealing all your data.

651
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,990
Speaker 6:  Well, with, with one recent exception, which we'll come back to,

652
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:30,190
Speaker 7:  But I'm curious how this like, because I think you're right Neli

653
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:34,070
Speaker 7:  where it is, it is people use this outside of this. How is that gonna

654
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,870
Speaker 7:  affect adoption when they change it? Because right now if you go and you

655
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:40,270
Speaker 7:  look at Discord and Slack, there's definitely some differences, but they

656
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:44,110
Speaker 7:  fundamentally look a lot alike. And now it's not gonna look like

657
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:47,990
Speaker 7:  that way. One's gonna be very for like business and the other's

658
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:51,950
Speaker 7:  gonna be where your gamer friends say me Mu and like, which

659
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:55,110
Speaker 7:  is the one, I don't have gamer friends to say that. Just to be clear,

660
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:56,310
Speaker 7:  you're the

661
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,670
Speaker 5:  Gamer friend who says that the,

662
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,030
Speaker 7:  Which is gonna be the one. Like, like are people gonna still use it or they're

663
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,870
Speaker 7:  gonna look at it and be like, Hmm, old people use that and click out of it.

664
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:09,830
Speaker 5:  So I have this like theory of competition and software and it

665
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:13,390
Speaker 5:  And I think it's best expressed with the Iowa standard. They

666
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,190
Speaker 5:  diverge in the way the interfaces look and then they converge again like

667
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:20,590
Speaker 5:  all the time. And you can drive yourself crazy

668
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:25,150
Speaker 5:  and certainly gain a lot of like hate replies on Twitter if you say

669
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:28,870
Speaker 5:  iOS copied Android or Android copied iOS. Right? Like that's the cycle they're

670
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:32,710
Speaker 5:  in. Right. But the reason they do that is very obvious is that if you

671
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:36,520
Speaker 5:  want people to switch between platforms, you have to lower the cognitive

672
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:40,240
Speaker 5:  burden of switching. Yep. If you are Google and you want people to switch

673
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,080
Speaker 5:  from iOS to Android, you cannot have a radically different

674
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,040
Speaker 5:  interface. Right? Yeah. You, you need to welcome them in and say most of

675
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,320
Speaker 5:  the things are in most of the same places and the things that are different

676
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,840
Speaker 5:  are substantially better for X, Y, or Z reason. And you can

677
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:58,920
Speaker 5:  100% argue over whether that is successful in the case of Android. But that's

678
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,240
Speaker 5:  basically the thinking, right? Is like you gotta make it easy to switch.

679
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:05,280
Speaker 5:  If you are Slack and Microsoft teams is way bigger than you,

680
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,480
Speaker 5:  it makes all the sense in the world that you're gonna make Slack look slightly

681
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:13,320
Speaker 5:  more like Microsoft teams to try to peel that market share

682
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:17,200
Speaker 5:  back. What's interesting, to your point Alex, is they're not

683
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,160
Speaker 5:  looking more like Discord. Yeah. Hmm. Because that's the other competitor.

684
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:24,360
Speaker 5:  It's just no one wants to admit that Discord is a competitor. Like I had

685
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,920
Speaker 5:  former Slack, C E O Stewart Butterfield on decoder ages ago,

686
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,400
Speaker 5:  I don't even been the verse might have been pre decoder the last time I talked

687
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,640
Speaker 5:  to him about this specific thing. He was like, yeah, I don't think Discord

688
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,520
Speaker 5:  ISS a competitor, but it obviously is. It's just in this moment

689
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:43,200
Speaker 5:  where where's the money? The money is paid users of

690
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,920
Speaker 5:  Microsoft teams, not a bunch of randos and a crypto discord.

691
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:47,720
Speaker 5:  And like

692
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,160
Speaker 7:  Remember a great time, time

693
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,200
Speaker 5:  Of their life over there. Yeah.

694
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:54,240
Speaker 6:  Slack and Discord have been refusing to run at each other for years.

695
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:58,560
Speaker 6:  Like, I remember asking the Discord folks, I don't know, four years

696
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:02,280
Speaker 6:  ago now, when are you doing Discord for teams? And they were like, we don't,

697
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,600
Speaker 6:  we don't wanna mess with that. It, it involves a bunch of like compliance

698
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:09,880
Speaker 6:  and administrative work we don't want to do. If you want to use it for work,

699
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:13,960
Speaker 6:  great. But that's not officially what it's for. And Slack says

700
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,360
Speaker 6:  literally the exact same thing in reverse. They're like, if you wanna use

701
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,560
Speaker 6:  it for personal stuff, that's awesome. Knock yourself out. That's not what

702
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,640
Speaker 6:  it's for. And it's like the, these two companies just keep staring at each

703
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,440
Speaker 6:  other like refusing to acknowledge that they're actually doing the same thing.

704
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:27,800
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

705
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:28,160
Speaker 5:  Well

706
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,360
Speaker 7:  I think that's why Slack was so popular versus

707
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:35,040
Speaker 7:  all of those competitors, right? Like remember HipChat,

708
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,960
Speaker 5:  We were a HipChat's shop for a minute. Oh yeah,

709
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:41,480
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Hip Chat, was it Campfire? Yep. And then like Teams.

710
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:45,600
Speaker 7:  Teams was, teams is relatively new and it was able to get an enormous market

711
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:49,200
Speaker 7:  share because it's Microsoft and it already was in all of those spaces. And

712
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,320
Speaker 7:  it was just like, Hey, now we give you this free cancel your Slack subscription.

713
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,440
Speaker 7:  And so for the longest time it was popular partially because it was such

714
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,440
Speaker 7:  a social app in a way that teams really isn't. And so it's like, okay, well

715
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,280
Speaker 7:  if you go that way, aren't you ruining why most people adopted

716
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,840
Speaker 7:  it to begin with? And I don't. I haven't used it. I don't know like if it

717
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:11,840
Speaker 7:  allows me to not accidentally broadcast things

718
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,920
Speaker 7:  that I thought were dms

719
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:13,600
Speaker 6:  Great,

720
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,400
Speaker 5:  The Alex Cranz experience,

721
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:20,400
Speaker 7:  But I look forward to it. But I am like curious if that's gonna happen.

722
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:20,880
Speaker 7:  And

723
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,360
Speaker 6:  Actually, ironically, Microsoft is the company that is trying to do both.

724
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:28,360
Speaker 6:  Like, it, it made all this noise a couple of years ago about Teams

725
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,320
Speaker 6:  for families, which to me is just like outrageous.

726
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:36,480
Speaker 5:  It's just a threat that's like Excel Yeah. For preschoolers. Like

727
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,120
Speaker 5:  we're coming for you.

728
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:43,120
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Like Microsoft cannot let go of this idea that you should

729
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:47,160
Speaker 6:  use its tools for your regular life. And to me it's like

730
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,760
Speaker 6:  if they had called it Microsoft Chat, it might have had a chance to be

731
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,120
Speaker 6:  something. Yeah. But if you, if like can neli, can you imagine

732
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:58,360
Speaker 6:  hanging up this call and going upstairs to Becky and being

733
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,720
Speaker 6:  like, Hey, let's plan in teams.

734
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:06,280
Speaker 5:  No. Again, my, my goal in life is to not use software.

735
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:11,680
Speaker 5:  It's just a stated goal. I, I think I've said this in the show, my ambition

736
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:16,360
Speaker 5:  in like my career is not to accumulate more titles or power.

737
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:20,720
Speaker 5:  It is to use as little enterprise software as possible. Like I

738
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,600
Speaker 5:  just want to get to the place where people walk into my office. I don't have

739
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,560
Speaker 5:  an office. So like I've got ages to go, but people like

740
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:30,920
Speaker 5:  show me printouts of emails, And, I, like sign them with a Sharpie.

741
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,360
Speaker 7:  I want this for you.

742
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:36,320
Speaker 5:  It's like all, all I want is to not use enterprise software at work.

743
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:39,480
Speaker 6:  You have an attache who carries your phone for you. Yeah.

744
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:43,760
Speaker 5:  And You know, like You know the, the masters of the universe. They're

745
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,600
Speaker 5:  not, you think Tim Cook looks at an email, he's got an iPad

746
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,480
Speaker 5:  for god's sake.

747
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:49,520
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

748
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,400
Speaker 7:  Does Tim Cook use an iPhone on?

749
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,280
Speaker 5:  That's actually a good question. I've never actually seen him use a phone.

750
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,480
Speaker 5:  I've seen him use an iPad.

751
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,440
Speaker 6:  Wait, Neela, do you, do you have like family coordination software

752
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:01,560
Speaker 6:  that you use? No,

753
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,280
Speaker 5:  We both work at home. Like we don't You need to do that stuff when you're

754
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,840
Speaker 5:  like asynchronous. But like we see each other all day long.

755
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,720
Speaker 6:  You just yell. You just yell

756
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:09,880
Speaker 7:  At

757
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,520
Speaker 6:  Her. Yeah.

758
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:14,320
Speaker 5:  Like we are, we are communicating, I think now Max is going to start in kindergarten.

759
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:18,680
Speaker 5:  So like there's a, there's another force in the world that

760
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,480
Speaker 5:  has to schedule us And, I think maybe now we will need to share a calendar.

761
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:24,960
Speaker 5:  But three people who spend all day together,

762
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,160
Speaker 5:  you should not need software to manage that relationship.

763
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:33,040
Speaker 5:  Really. I really cannot emphasize that enough. If you spend all day

764
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:37,000
Speaker 5:  with two other people, you should not be like, I'd like to introduce some

765
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:37,960
Speaker 5:  software into this.

766
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:42,120
Speaker 6:  There was a minute where I tried to get my wife on on Trello

767
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:46,160
Speaker 6:  for life planning purposes and the, she was into it,

768
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,000
Speaker 6:  but then we couldn't agree on how to format the Trello cards. So

769
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,880
Speaker 6:  it all fell apart.

770
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,840
Speaker 6:  She, I was just like, no, you have to use these things as checklists on the

771
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,880
Speaker 6:  Trello cards. And she was just like, whatever, I'm gonna write it all in

772
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,760
Speaker 6:  the description and like three days later it just all fell apart. And now

773
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,440
Speaker 6:  we just have like a series of context free

774
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:07,680
Speaker 6:  links sent in our text message chain. And that's, that's our, yeah, that's

775
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,200
Speaker 6:  how we talk to each other.

776
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,720
Speaker 5:  That's not good. Are you, have you have I converted you to Apple Watch walkie

777
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:15,160
Speaker 5:  talkie people yet? That's the the thing I'm gonna miss the most when we like

778
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,960
Speaker 5:  go back to offices and lives and whatever.

779
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:20,840
Speaker 6:  No, she's a green bubble. Anna Anna's a pixel owner

780
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:24,960
Speaker 6:  and a very happy one who will never switch. So when I'm like using our

781
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,920
Speaker 6:  testing an Android phone, we can just like duo our faces off and it's

782
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,440
Speaker 6:  great. But sadly, sadly there will be no

783
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,040
Speaker 6:  walkie-talkies.

784
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,920
Speaker 7:  Walkie-talkie is dangerous. No one in my family understands how to use

785
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,840
Speaker 7:  it. So I had to turn it off 'cause I'd be like just hearing the whistling

786
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:43,920
Speaker 7:  from my wrist W whatever I was doing that day, And I was like, nope, we're

787
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,480
Speaker 7:  not doing this anymore. Revoked.

788
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:49,600
Speaker 5:  We are so deep in the, I mean this is enterprise, this is when

789
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,800
Speaker 5:  you say have you integrated Microsoft teams into your life? It's like n no.

790
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:57,120
Speaker 5:  But have you been in the grocery store talking to your wrist about which

791
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:01,000
Speaker 5:  bread to purchase? Yes. Effectively

792
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:04,920
Speaker 5:  on speaker phone too. Like yeah, it's the Apple Watch is is loud now

793
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,880
Speaker 5:  and I'm just like, boop.

794
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:15,400
Speaker 5:  Like, like I said, my entire life is just headed toward power moves of this

795
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:19,400
Speaker 5:  kind. That's all I want. Love it. We actually, we we're kind of on

796
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,280
Speaker 5:  the subject of like a bunch of behaviors changed and the pandemic work from

797
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,840
Speaker 5:  home moment and now everyone's sort of headed back to offices in various

798
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:30,440
Speaker 5:  ways. One a very funny example of that Zoom called everyone back to office

799
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:34,280
Speaker 5:  this week, which is choice Zoom. Like just

800
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,600
Speaker 5:  perfectly choice. Do

801
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,560
Speaker 6:  You think Zoom knew, like when they're sitting there being like, we're about

802
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,360
Speaker 6:  to send this like all staff email telling everybody to come back to the office.

803
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:45,360
Speaker 6:  Like do you think they knew that? They were like, well we we're about to

804
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:48,040
Speaker 6:  play ourselves so hard. As soon as this email goes out, if

805
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:51,680
Speaker 5:  I'm Zoom, I'm doing this just to generate some headlines about Zoom. 'cause

806
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,360
Speaker 5:  like no one's been talking about Zoom for weeks. You know and it's like You

807
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,800
Speaker 5:  know what we should do is call everyone back to the office. Like everyone

808
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,400
Speaker 5:  will be like, remember Zoom? Zoom was great. It was better than the teams

809
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:04,200
Speaker 5:  were forced to use Network. Where's that IT guy spending the money in the

810
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:04,560
Speaker 5:  strip club,

811
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:11,160
Speaker 7:  He's out there. He's like, oh you want Zoom? I got you.

812
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,200
Speaker 7:  He just, he's free with the budget.

813
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,520
Speaker 5:  And then Zoom also got itself in trouble this week as you alluded to earlier,

814
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,960
Speaker 5:  David. Yeah. They changed their terms of service. And I

815
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:25,680
Speaker 5:  understand why they changed their terms of service. They just did it in the

816
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,080
Speaker 5:  most ham-fisted stupid way possible. So they basically changed their terms

817
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,360
Speaker 5:  of service to say all the data that you're putting through Zoom, zoom has

818
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,160
Speaker 5:  a license to, and they need that. If you run a service on the

819
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:40,080
Speaker 5:  internet, you, you need a license to all the data that users put into your

820
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:44,240
Speaker 5:  service for any infinite number of copyright reasons. Like

821
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:48,400
Speaker 5:  you run servers, you're gonna copy data from one server to another, you're

822
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,520
Speaker 5:  gonna introduce new features that might remix the user data, all this stuff.

823
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:55,000
Speaker 5:  So you just need this like big broad license. And then the

824
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,440
Speaker 6:  Example you always use when we talk about this stuff that I really like is

825
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,880
Speaker 6:  thumbnails. Yeah. If they don't have the rights to

826
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:05,480
Speaker 6:  use and change and copy your stuff, they can't make the little versions of

827
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,360
Speaker 6:  the image that you click on to get the big version of the image. Like it's

828
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,160
Speaker 6:  that simple in many

829
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:12,040
Speaker 5:  Cases. Oh yes. They can't overlay text on those images. They, because that's

830
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,720
Speaker 5:  a derivative. You just write yourself the biggest, broadest license you can

831
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:18,880
Speaker 5:  and they added these lines that are like for artificial

832
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,600
Speaker 5:  intelligence and training models and it's like everyone lost their mind

833
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:23,520
Speaker 7:  So fast

834
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,360
Speaker 5:  By the raw language of it. That means everything you say into Zoom

835
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:30,200
Speaker 5:  can be used to train artificial intelligence.

836
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:34,160
Speaker 6:  Right? It's like, oh, we're selling your data to open AI to put into GPT

837
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,560
Speaker 6:  four. Right. And we're allowed to now is like the, the

838
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,840
Speaker 6:  implication of that, I, speaking of the strike, I saw a bunch of people

839
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:45,080
Speaker 6:  in Hollywood tweeting like, oh we can't use Zoom when we're creating stuff

840
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:48,760
Speaker 6:  anymore. It's like people are so primed to see

841
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:52,560
Speaker 6:  this stuff being taken from them and see this all being used against them

842
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:56,400
Speaker 6:  in a lot of ways that Zoom did this the wrong way at exactly

843
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,520
Speaker 6:  the wrong time. Yeah.

844
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:01,640
Speaker 7:  If they'd done this like three months ago, nobody would've batted an I until

845
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:05,440
Speaker 7:  somebody like did a TikTok right now being like, did You know three months

846
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:09,440
Speaker 7:  ago Zoom decided to steal all your data and give it

847
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,040
Speaker 7:  to chat G P T and now you own nothing including your face

848
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:14,200
Speaker 7:  Zoom does.

849
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:18,320
Speaker 5:  Right? So this specific block of text is in like

850
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:22,280
Speaker 5:  almost every terms of service and it's, it's just like what you need

851
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:26,480
Speaker 5:  to run a service, right? You need to take a perpetual, worldwide,

852
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,280
Speaker 5:  non-exclusive, royalty free sub-license or transferrable license to do stuff.

853
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:34,160
Speaker 5:  Access, use store, transmit, review, disclose, preserve, extract, like it's

854
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,840
Speaker 5:  just a list of verbs. We are giving ourselves the broadest license

855
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:41,280
Speaker 5:  to do verbs to your data. Because if you run a service,

856
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:43,960
Speaker 5:  there's, you want to do stuff, you're gonna,

857
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:44,320
Speaker 7:  You're gonna

858
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,440
Speaker 5:  Do verbs. Verbs is what we're here for. It's not nouns.

859
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:52,420
Speaker 5:  If you're living a nouns life, You know. So they added this language

860
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,460
Speaker 5:  about artificial intelligence. So you just kind of combine the like usual

861
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:59,340
Speaker 5:  panic like every couple years, like some teenager discovers the

862
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:02,540
Speaker 5:  Instagram terms of service and people freak out. Yep. Yeah. And everyone

863
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:05,500
Speaker 5:  posts that copy that's like, I do not give Instagram the permission to do

864
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,980
Speaker 5:  shit and then I have to like write a blog post that's an auto complete of

865
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,180
Speaker 5:  a blog post here. Four years ago,

866
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:13,980
Speaker 6:  This is literally the case by the way. J Peters wrote our, our story about

867
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:18,420
Speaker 6:  this Zoom AI thing and has back links to one about

868
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:22,300
Speaker 6:  Instagram from 2012 and one about Dropbox and

869
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:25,700
Speaker 6:  Google Drive also from 2012. And they are, I mean like

870
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:29,740
Speaker 6:  almost exactly the same post, both written by Neli both being

871
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:33,660
Speaker 6:  like, guys, this is just, this is just the words you need to

872
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:36,700
Speaker 6:  have things on servers. Everything's probably fine. But so

873
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:40,540
Speaker 5:  What's interesting about this is there's the general AI panic that is happening.

874
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:43,780
Speaker 5:  It's like David was saying, even the writer strike has, has big elements

875
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:47,740
Speaker 5:  to this. And then there's the actual problem, which is yeah, if you

876
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:51,060
Speaker 5:  just read the language, it sure sounds like it. So Zoom had to clarify

877
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:55,620
Speaker 5:  that customer data is customer data, which is if you are an enterprise software

878
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:58,780
Speaker 5:  company, the worst thing to have to clarify.

879
00:49:59,260 --> 00:49:59,420
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

880
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:03,900
Speaker 5:  Like that's the whole point of the enterprise software company. That's fundamentally

881
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,780
Speaker 5:  why Slack and Discord are not the same, right? Like Slack makes these big

882
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:11,260
Speaker 5:  promises to big businesses about its relationship to them.

883
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:15,660
Speaker 5:  And Discord is like, yeah, it's for Gamers. We're gonna mine all

884
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:19,260
Speaker 5:  of your data. Like it's You know. It's like, it's just like a very different

885
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:23,100
Speaker 5:  approach. And, I, think Zoom stepped in it and we're gonna see

886
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:26,540
Speaker 5:  hundreds of other companies step in it because at the end of the day,

887
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:31,200
Speaker 5:  zoom probably wants to use AI to do things like better

888
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,040
Speaker 5:  beauty filters that people ask for in Zoom calls to do things

889
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:38,800
Speaker 5:  like automated transcripts that are better than the already AI

890
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,620
Speaker 5:  powered automated transcripts are doing. What you want is to write yourself

891
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:46,460
Speaker 5:  a broad license so you can innovate freely. And the reality is you,

892
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,500
Speaker 5:  you're gonna have to start asking permission step by step for all that stuff.

893
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,540
Speaker 5:  'cause this panic is coming over and over again.

894
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:55,860
Speaker 6:  Part of me is like, okay, zoom did this exactly wrong, right? Like

895
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:59,860
Speaker 6:  the, they added a statement after all of this kerfuffle that

896
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:03,380
Speaker 6:  said, not withstanding the above, which is a deeply hilarious way to say,

897
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:07,300
Speaker 6:  well we wrote that badly. So here's some new words. Zoom will not use audio,

898
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:11,100
Speaker 6:  video or chat customer content to train our artificial intelligence models

899
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:15,060
Speaker 6:  without your consent. Like a, like you're saying Eli Wild that

900
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:17,540
Speaker 6:  that was not in there the first time, but b

901
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:22,460
Speaker 6:  I kind of don't know other than that one

902
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,660
Speaker 6:  bit of, I think clarification that some lawyer at

903
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:30,060
Speaker 6:  Zoom didn't think they needed to do because it was inherently obvious but

904
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:33,460
Speaker 6:  is not obvious to people who like to track changes on terms of service.

905
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:37,900
Speaker 6:  It's, this is just a hard thing to do. And I think one of the things

906
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:41,180
Speaker 6:  we've discovered with a lot of these tools is like the thing that happens

907
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:45,180
Speaker 6:  when somebody starts recording a Zoom call and there's that very loud thing

908
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:48,620
Speaker 6:  that goes like, this meeting is now being recorded. Yeah. And they have this

909
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:52,460
Speaker 6:  new thing with the AI meeting summaries where it like

910
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:56,260
Speaker 6:  goes way out of its way to let You know that it's doing AI meeting

911
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:59,980
Speaker 6:  summaries and you have to like click a thing to make the giant window

912
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:03,780
Speaker 6:  full of texts go away. We're just setting ourselves up for this

913
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:07,580
Speaker 6:  like heinous user experience because these companies are

914
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:11,500
Speaker 6:  afraid of our reaction to what they're doing in order to run their service.

915
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,340
Speaker 6:  And there it feels like there has to be a middle ground in there somewhere,

916
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,860
Speaker 6:  but I don't know what it is and it feels like it's gonna be a while before

917
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:17,340
Speaker 6:  we find it.

918
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:21,740
Speaker 7:  I think it's like one, they have to repeatedly prove that

919
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:25,180
Speaker 7:  they're not gonna do nefarious things with your data. And

920
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,700
Speaker 7:  that's pretty hard for them to currently do because

921
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:32,720
Speaker 7:  everything we cover at The Verge dot com, there's so many examples of it,

922
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:36,120
Speaker 7:  right? And so like they've, they've kind of set themselves up to fail in

923
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,720
Speaker 7:  that respect because they have misused data over and over and over and over

924
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:43,360
Speaker 7:  again. Yes. And so it'd be like, no, no, but this time is different. Like

925
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,680
Speaker 7:  nobody's gonna believe that you've got, you've got a really sa you've got,

926
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,520
Speaker 7:  people are way more savvy about this stuff than they were 10, 15 years ago.

927
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:53,920
Speaker 7:  And so you, you've gotta fix that And I think until they can

928
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:57,840
Speaker 7:  kind of earn that trust back, they're gonna be in this

929
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:01,720
Speaker 7:  place. And then the other side of it is like, people please like go read

930
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,840
Speaker 7:  anything chat G P T wrote that is longer than like

931
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,920
Speaker 7:  a hundred words and then come back to me and say that it's gonna steal my

932
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,840
Speaker 7:  job. Like right. You know this stuff is not, we,

933
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,640
Speaker 7:  we are very excited about it and everybody's like, oh it's gotten so big.

934
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:19,600
Speaker 7:  But at the same time it is still very early days chat G P T and these

935
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,880
Speaker 7:  other generative AI systems are

936
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:27,000
Speaker 7:  gonna be writing really good books. They'll write books but they're not gonna

937
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,360
Speaker 7:  be readable fun books most of the time. Yeah.

938
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,240
Speaker 6:  I do wonder though if, to your point neli about

939
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,640
Speaker 6:  companies running into this, if what they're gonna learn from this is

940
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:42,560
Speaker 6:  just barrel your way through it. No, that's all. Don't ask.

941
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:46,640
Speaker 6:  We've learned, don't be nice, just do what Google did and say Yeah,

942
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:49,200
Speaker 6:  we take your shit from the internet. What are you gonna do about it?

943
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:52,480
Speaker 5:  Yeah. The problem is Zoom exists in a world where Microsoft Teams exists

944
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:53,320
Speaker 7:  And Slack

945
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:57,520
Speaker 5:  Fair and Slack, right? Like Google Google's approach to

946
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,360
Speaker 5:  data on the internet right now explicitly now in some of their terms is if

947
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:05,080
Speaker 5:  the crawler can see it, we can train AI with it. Yeah.

948
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:09,280
Speaker 5:  And that's a nightmare choice, right? You have to say don't

949
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:11,600
Speaker 5:  index my website in Google search.

950
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,690
Speaker 5:  Okay. Like maybe like, I'm gonna shut my business down rather than like Google

951
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:21,370
Speaker 5:  train its models on my, like you have to be Google to put yourself in that

952
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:24,730
Speaker 5:  position with Zoom. It's like, well I'm just not gonna use Zoom. Like it's

953
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:27,210
Speaker 5:  like the market works. The real answer I think is

954
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:32,010
Speaker 5:  unfeasible in America. But you need some sort of privacy

955
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:36,010
Speaker 5:  law so that if they do overstep, there's a consequence in that keeps them

956
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:36,290
Speaker 5:  in line.

957
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:42,290
Speaker 5:  I don't know if we're gonna get that anytime soon. I just want you to try

958
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:45,970
Speaker 5:  to, I keep using this example. You have to go into Chuck Schumer's office

959
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:50,730
Speaker 5:  and be like, alright, there's a spectrum of AI

960
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:54,610
Speaker 5:  things here from beauty filters in Zoom to the people on Reddit

961
00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:58,130
Speaker 5:  who faked Globo to make the AI right about

962
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,970
Speaker 5:  Globo and World of Warcraft. Write a law Chuck.

963
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:04,170
Speaker 6:  Well if that's the spectrum, the law is just, all these things are very good.

964
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:05,330
Speaker 6:  No problems,

965
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,330
Speaker 7:  Only good things there. Only upsides.

966
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:16,610
Speaker 5:  All right, let's end on on my favorite story of the week. Same enterprise

967
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:20,810
Speaker 5:  software, real middle section on enterprise software here. Speaking of work

968
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:23,930
Speaker 5:  from home, the Zoom explosion, all this stuff in the height of the pandemic,

969
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:26,770
Speaker 5:  when everyone thought no one was ever gonna go work in office again, it was

970
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:30,290
Speaker 5:  all video conferencing forever. Verizon bought a company called BlueJeans

971
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:34,410
Speaker 5:  for $400 million. Ugh.

972
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,930
Speaker 5:  They, this was a big deal. Like yeah. The c e o of Verizon went on C N B

973
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:41,970
Speaker 5:  C to announce it. They were talking about how they're gonna roll it into

974
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:46,050
Speaker 5:  five g Verizon, You know a big IT supplier. They're like

975
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:50,290
Speaker 5:  our distribution network. This is the future of business BlueJeans powered

976
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:54,170
Speaker 5:  by Verizon. Give all your employees Verizon five G phones. The

977
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:57,850
Speaker 5:  low latency BlueJeans experience will blow anyway. They shut it down this

978
00:55:57,850 --> 00:55:58,010
Speaker 5:  week.

979
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,010
Speaker 7:  It's 'cause Have you ever used BlueJeans?

980
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:06,610
Speaker 5:  No, no, no, no. I'm a I'm a regular human. Yeah.

981
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:09,930
Speaker 7:  I had to. So that's what the, the, the Writer's Guild of America used as

982
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:13,450
Speaker 7:  its software. Oh. And so when I was a a union steward,

983
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:17,410
Speaker 7:  you'd have 200 people on a call in blue jeans

984
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:19,290
Speaker 7:  and no one knew how it worked. Should

985
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:20,690
Speaker 6:  Have gone on strike about that. Yeah.

986
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:21,690
Speaker 5:  I'm sorry Jesus. Sorry.

987
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:26,360
Speaker 7:  Yeah. Really. Fuck Alex. It was brutal. It was

988
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:29,640
Speaker 7:  just the worst app on the planet. And. I. Remember when Verizon bought it?

989
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,520
Speaker 7:  I was like, they'll either they'll make it good or they didn't understand

990
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:36,360
Speaker 7:  that they bought garbage. And it sounds like it was the

991
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:36,960
Speaker 7:  latter. Let

992
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,400
Speaker 5:  Me just put that headline right next to something else. Verizon will soon

993
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:42,760
Speaker 5:  raise prices on unlimited plans again.

994
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:44,040
Speaker 6:  Yep.

995
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:48,000
Speaker 5:  Maybe if you hadn't lit $400 million on

996
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:52,600
Speaker 5:  fire buying a a third rate video conferencing app to make

997
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:56,440
Speaker 5:  your five G network better, you could have just kept the prices lower. Just

998
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:58,760
Speaker 7:  Garbage software. Yeah.

999
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,760
Speaker 6:  I just, I just feel it. It's called Blue Jeans. Like this is,

1000
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,920
Speaker 6:  why have I told you about the career I'm gonna have when I leave The Verge

1001
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,040
Speaker 6:  where I just walk into rooms and say that name is stupid. And then somebody

1002
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,800
Speaker 6:  writes me a check for $50,000 And I leave Blue. What a

1003
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,520
Speaker 6:  stupid name. Can I Oh Blue Jeans me. Like are you serious? That

1004
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,240
Speaker 6:  company never had a chance for one second. They

1005
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:22,040
Speaker 5:  Had a bunch of marketing that was like nothing fits like blue jeans like

1006
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,160
Speaker 5:  that. That's what they were doing.

1007
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:26,640
Speaker 6:  That's true. And has nothing to do with video conferencing.

1008
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:30,520
Speaker 5:  I'm just gonna read you this sentence. We have made the difficult decision

1009
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:32,960
Speaker 5:  to sunset our suite of blue jeans products.

1010
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:34,920
Speaker 7:  There is more than one product

1011
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,840
Speaker 6:  We are taking off our blue jeans.

1012
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:42,800
Speaker 5:  That's bad. So if you're on a Verizon, go unlimited Beyond

1013
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:46,080
Speaker 5:  unlimited or above unlimited. Sure. This

1014
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:49,120
Speaker 6:  Is some real Disney Streaming shit here. I don't like this. Yeah,

1015
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,120
Speaker 5:  You'll be playing $3 more per month. They do this like

1016
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:57,200
Speaker 5:  clockwork every year because the new iPhones are

1017
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,400
Speaker 5:  coming out and they don't want you on the legacy plans when you get a new

1018
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,120
Speaker 5:  iPhone. They want you to put you on the new, more expensive plans when you

1019
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,960
Speaker 5:  get the new phone. And so every year they come out with new plans and

1020
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:10,400
Speaker 5:  new blah blah blah. The new subsidies for the iPhones. And they make the

1021
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,760
Speaker 5:  old plans more expensive every year like clockwork. And it's,

1022
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,800
Speaker 5:  I'm just gonna point out that they, if they had not lit

1023
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:22,440
Speaker 5:  $400 million on fire

1024
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,360
Speaker 5:  on a product called Blue Jeans, maybe their investors

1025
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:30,280
Speaker 5:  would be happier with them and maybe, maybe just, maybe

1026
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,480
Speaker 5:  they wouldn't have to raise prices so much. Also, maybe if we hadn't let

1027
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,880
Speaker 5:  T-Mobile buy Sprint and there are actually four wireless carriers in this

1028
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,320
Speaker 5:  country. It'd be actual competition market. That's just me.

1029
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:43,640
Speaker 5:  We don't have a Dish Network Gen Fivey update for you today

1030
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:45,560
Speaker 5:  'cause they've done fuck all

1031
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:48,000
Speaker 6:  That sounds right.

1032
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:49,880
Speaker 7:  That's accurate.

1033
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:53,400
Speaker 5:  Just saying Dish Network was supposed to in a long

1034
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:57,320
Speaker 5:  confusing deal brokered by the Trump administration, stand up a

1035
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:01,200
Speaker 5:  fourth five G network using a technology called O Ran

1036
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:03,600
Speaker 5:  that would compete with the Giants.

1037
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,800
Speaker 5:  You can, you look around well,

1038
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:11,560
Speaker 6:  But now Dish Network is merging with EchoStar. So that's which

1039
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:15,320
Speaker 5:  Is the same company. I just want to point out, if you are

1040
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:19,320
Speaker 5:  an old billionaire and you have two companies and you're like, I don't

1041
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:22,880
Speaker 5:  know, merge 'em up together, you have accomplished nothing. This is like

1042
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,320
Speaker 5:  when people made me tried to make me care about Paramount and Viacom and

1043
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,640
Speaker 5:  c B s all merging and the only good thing about it was that like

1044
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:33,160
Speaker 5:  the parent company was called National Amusements, which is like deeply funny.

1045
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:37,040
Speaker 5:  And it's like, but it's all just the same. Like one old guy owned all the

1046
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,710
Speaker 5:  companies, right? And you're like, yeah. And they're like, oh man, this is

1047
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:43,310
Speaker 5:  the greatest succession drama. It's like, no, it's all just the same

1048
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:47,950
Speaker 5:  company. Like none of this matters. That's

1049
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:50,870
Speaker 5:  Dish and EchoStar merging, which we wrote about this week, which is fine.

1050
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:53,750
Speaker 5:  I'm just pointing out we were supposed to have four wireless carriers in

1051
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:57,390
Speaker 5:  America. We let T-Mobile buy Sprint, which was a, a mess. And then

1052
00:59:57,670 --> 01:00:01,150
Speaker 5:  we brokered instead of anything real,

1053
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:05,350
Speaker 5:  a fake idea about Dish Network making a fourth network, which look around

1054
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:07,940
Speaker 5:  doesn't exist.

1055
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:11,140
Speaker 6:  It's going really great. I would just say

1056
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:16,300
Speaker 6:  Dish and EchoStar could combine, rename their network to Blue

1057
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:17,780
Speaker 6:  jeans and be heroes.

1058
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:19,540
Speaker 5:  It's

1059
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:20,060
Speaker 6:  Just right there.

1060
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:26,860
Speaker 5:  Look, we like asking for your emails. We're gonna take a break. We'll come

1061
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:29,420
Speaker 5:  back, we'll read some emails. If you are a person

1062
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:33,840
Speaker 5:  beyond just my phone is faster or

1063
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:38,530
Speaker 5:  I've downloaded more pirated Netflix videos than ever in an

1064
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:41,210
Speaker 5:  airport. If you're someone who's actually like,

1065
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:45,570
Speaker 5:  experienced the benefits of five G, I want to hear from you. It cannot be

1066
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:49,530
Speaker 5:  that your bandwidth is just faster. I'm talking you did a robot

1067
01:00:49,530 --> 01:00:53,460
Speaker 5:  surgery. Like one of these things they told us would happen

1068
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:56,620
Speaker 5:  with five g I have one example for everyone.

1069
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:01,500
Speaker 5:  I'll, I'll put it out there right now. Last night I watched Taylor

1070
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:05,460
Speaker 5:  Swift announce 1989 Taylor's version from SoFi Stadium on

1071
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:09,220
Speaker 5:  like 45 different like crystal clear live streams on TikTok.

1072
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:13,300
Speaker 5:  That is because N F L stadiums have millimeter wave five G in them.

1073
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:17,230
Speaker 5:  That's why That's it. That's the future baby. But that, okay, I'll give you

1074
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:20,870
Speaker 5:  that one. I I I've taken that one off the table. They put so much

1075
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:23,790
Speaker 5:  bandwidth in N F NFL stadiums that I watched

1076
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:28,150
Speaker 5:  effectively pirate live streams of a Taylor Swift concert. Okay, that one's

1077
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:30,750
Speaker 5:  off the table. Give me something else. Email us Vercast The Verge dot com.

1078
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:34,630
Speaker 5:  I'm dying to know if anyone has done like a

1079
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,470
Speaker 5:  robot five G surgery. If they've deployed a

1080
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:41,670
Speaker 5:  low latency application to a telecom company's

1081
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:46,190
Speaker 5:  edge data center. You let me know. I I 'cause I haven't seen one

1082
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:48,350
Speaker 5:  other than these phones are slightly faster. Does

1083
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:50,430
Speaker 7:  Updating your laptop at a hotel count?

1084
01:01:50,690 --> 01:01:51,830
Speaker 5:  No. That's just more bandwidth,

1085
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,750
Speaker 7:  Which was really nice bandwidth.

1086
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:58,870
Speaker 5:  You, you cannot give me, you cannot give me, I can pull down one gig

1087
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:02,830
Speaker 5:  speeds, blah, blah, blah. You have to give me something on the order

1088
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:06,790
Speaker 5:  of tens of thousands of people in A N F L stadium

1089
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:11,550
Speaker 5:  live streamed crystal clear video to the internet

1090
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:15,540
Speaker 5:  all at once, right? Not just you alone stood on a

1091
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:18,620
Speaker 5:  street corner with, with high bandwidth, tens of thousands of people

1092
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:23,400
Speaker 5:  used the internet once to because of the Taylor Swift. Like that is a, that

1093
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:27,120
Speaker 5:  that And I give you that, that is a meaningful five

1094
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:30,880
Speaker 5:  g thing that you could not do with an L T E network. But give me like one

1095
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,080
Speaker 5:  more like we did not do all of this for the ERAS tour.

1096
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:36,000
Speaker 5:  At least I don't think we did.

1097
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,800
Speaker 5:  Vercast is Verge hot. Email us. We'll be right back.

1098
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:50,100
Speaker 5:  All right, we're back. We have a little bit of lightning around. There's

1099
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,940
Speaker 5:  some good stuff in the lightning round this week I gotta say. Yeah. But before

1100
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:56,900
Speaker 5:  we get to that, last week we asked about fart apps in the Vision Pro. I will

1101
01:02:56,900 --> 01:03:00,580
Speaker 5:  say one person completely misinterpreted that conversation got very mad at

1102
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:04,300
Speaker 5:  me on Twitter. What we were saying is when you have a new platform like the

1103
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:07,940
Speaker 5:  Vision Pro, the first wave of apps is like toys.

1104
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:11,620
Speaker 5:  It's like silly stuff, which was the first wave of apps on the iPhone.

1105
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,660
Speaker 5:  And then everyone like figured out what they could do because they made so

1106
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:18,460
Speaker 5:  many stupid silly apps. And then you get the wave

1107
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:21,500
Speaker 5:  of mobile apps that is like revolutionized culture. There's someone on Twitter

1108
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:25,020
Speaker 5:  who's like super mad at me that I'm not aware of

1109
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,780
Speaker 5:  the apparently successful enterprise VR apps that exist today. And it's true,

1110
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:29,140
Speaker 5:  I'm not

1111
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:31,780
Speaker 6:  BlueJeans vr also Apple coming to

1112
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:37,020
Speaker 5:  Whatever. But this was a prompt, like what's the first wave of silly apps

1113
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,560
Speaker 5:  for the Vision Pro gonna be. We got some good answers.

1114
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:43,720
Speaker 6:  We did. I have also come up with one that I think is

1115
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:46,680
Speaker 6:  correct and I'm gonna quit my job and make it and I'm gonna make a fortune

1116
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:49,360
Speaker 6:  in the first year. But we should go through the ones that we got because

1117
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:53,160
Speaker 6:  they're all generally very good. What is, we'll,

1118
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,160
Speaker 6:  we'll come back. That

1119
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,600
Speaker 7:  Was a tease David. That was a tease.

1120
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,680
Speaker 6:  I have to, I have to read through and see all of these to decide if I'm gonna

1121
01:03:58,680 --> 01:03:59,280
Speaker 6:  share my idea.

1122
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:05,080
Speaker 5:  All right, so the first one, Josh w his idea for a vision

1123
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:08,860
Speaker 5:  pro fart app Drunk vision, which makes a lot of sense, although

1124
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:11,220
Speaker 5:  you'll puke right away. Literally it's throw

1125
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:12,100
Speaker 6:  Up in your head. Yeah.

1126
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:17,700
Speaker 5:  And then that leads right into his second idea, which is Shroom vision. I

1127
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:21,820
Speaker 5:  I buy it. Right? What if you could feel like, like Aren Rogers

1128
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:25,620
Speaker 5:  mode for your Vision Pro is like, it's also called Vision Pro. Very good.

1129
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:29,820
Speaker 5:  Justin g wrote try on clothes app. It's Snapchat

1130
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:32,180
Speaker 5:  filters for your whole body and all you have to do is look at someone else

1131
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:34,660
Speaker 5:  dangerous idea. My

1132
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:37,940
Speaker 6:  Immediate reaction to this was, oh that seems really smart. And then one

1133
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:39,460
Speaker 6:  second later I went, oh no.

1134
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:40,980
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1135
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:46,020
Speaker 6:  But I will say the thing like everyone at Snapchat keeps telling me

1136
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:50,460
Speaker 6:  that the ar tryon thing is real and people like it

1137
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,420
Speaker 6:  and use it. And if you could like put on your vision pro and

1138
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:57,460
Speaker 6:  stand in front of the mirror and like see how you would look and stuff like

1139
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:01,020
Speaker 6:  there will be something like that. And I bet it'll work. I don't know about

1140
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:02,900
Speaker 6:  the All you have to do is look at someone else thing.

1141
01:05:03,370 --> 01:05:06,540
Speaker 5:  Yeah, there's some real consent issues there. I don't wanna

1142
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:10,060
Speaker 7:  Be able to change other people's clothes. That seems like a no go.

1143
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:11,980
Speaker 5:  Here's what I'm thinking. Realtime revenge porn.

1144
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:19,400
Speaker 5:  There's like app store review problems in there. We'll see. But I get it.

1145
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:23,200
Speaker 5:  People like that idea. Michael G says, the obvious answer is

1146
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:26,760
Speaker 5:  fart clouds floating around the user with spatial audio fart sounds.

1147
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:30,760
Speaker 6:  This literally is the answer. Spatial audio fart sounds is a thing that will

1148
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,920
Speaker 6:  happen. Like Michael has spoken that into existence and this will happen.

1149
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:34,760
Speaker 6:  Now. People

1150
01:05:34,790 --> 01:05:38,160
Speaker 5:  Took the fart at prompt a little too literally. 'cause Zach

1151
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:42,320
Speaker 5:  wrote transparency mode. And you not only hear a fart, but you see

1152
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,120
Speaker 5:  a plume of purple and green come out of butts

1153
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:49,120
Speaker 5:  That's right up there with Snapchat filters whole.

1154
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:55,160
Speaker 5:  But like can you imagine you're gonna wearing a $3,500 headset,

1155
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:59,000
Speaker 5:  you're walking around the city and you're just like

1156
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:03,000
Speaker 5:  waiting for farts. So you can see the like sparkle

1157
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,960
Speaker 6:  Farts. Oh, so wait, so you're imagining this not as a way to like make

1158
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,480
Speaker 6:  it look as if someone is fart. You're imagining like a fart recognition system.

1159
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:13,080
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's transparency mode for farts

1160
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:14,520
Speaker 7:  Fart detector. Oh

1161
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:15,200
Speaker 5:  Yeah.

1162
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:18,880
Speaker 6:  So somebody farts and it's just, it's like the, the thing in the pool that

1163
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,840
Speaker 6:  turns your p purple. It's just like ar farts.

1164
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:25,760
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's, it's that. And every time it happens, you hear an Apple executive

1165
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,160
Speaker 5:  say something like, with the power of the M two chip, like

1166
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:35,840
Speaker 5:  Christopher c writes Slowmo running from Baywatch in whatever space

1167
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:39,240
Speaker 5:  you are in, which I actually don't understand. It's like

1168
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:42,520
Speaker 7:  You're putting it on and you're walking down the street and in addition to

1169
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:45,520
Speaker 7:  all the other people, it's this person's slow motion running towards you.

1170
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,760
Speaker 6:  It's just Pamela Anderson slowly running it's,

1171
01:06:47,790 --> 01:06:51,720
Speaker 5:  It's Tesla off. It's good that you went to Pamela Anderson. And

1172
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:54,560
Speaker 5:  I went to That's nice. Asshole Hof. That's nice. That says it all really.

1173
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:58,120
Speaker 5:  All right. And then my last one, this is my favorite one because it includes

1174
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,680
Speaker 5:  the phrase benefit hypothesis.

1175
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:00,320
Speaker 6:  Hell yeah.

1176
01:07:01,070 --> 01:07:04,680
Speaker 5:  It's very good. So Ruben wrote app description

1177
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:08,520
Speaker 5:  colon. When the U s a men's soccer team wins the World Cup,

1178
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:12,840
Speaker 5:  then your Apple Vision Pro will livestream video of former

1179
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:14,600
Speaker 5:  President Donald Trump in prison.

1180
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:17,760
Speaker 6:  Wow. That turned hard in the middle there. It

1181
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:21,720
Speaker 5:  Did. Benefit hypothesis. Both political parties will wonder how a

1182
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:25,440
Speaker 5:  former US president spends his time in prison. Two. The

1183
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:29,400
Speaker 5:  curiosity will cause a positive effect on USA's overall

1184
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:31,920
Speaker 5:  soccer performance over time. So they're

1185
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,600
Speaker 6:  Gonna wanna win so bad so that we can see that. Yeah. Oh, interesting.

1186
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:36,280
Speaker 6:  Yeah.

1187
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:37,320
Speaker 5:  So that we can all see it.

1188
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,720
Speaker 6:  I don't know if this has to do with the Vision Pro, but it's an interesting

1189
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:41,000
Speaker 6:  incentive strategy. And

1190
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,800
Speaker 5:  Then he has some potential names here. Victory Watch, ex-president edition,

1191
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:49,440
Speaker 5:  the champion's presidential Stream goal to watch POTUS in prison.

1192
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:51,000
Speaker 6:  These all sound like golf tournaments.

1193
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:55,600
Speaker 5:  And then number 10 here at the end, soccer glory presidential story.

1194
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:02,240
Speaker 5:  I don't know man. I like getting emails. Wow. That's

1195
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:02,840
Speaker 7:  So good.

1196
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:08,060
Speaker 5:  Very good. If you have ideas, this, we already had the prompt. If you have

1197
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:11,840
Speaker 5:  had a meaningful five G experience, you email me and I'm,

1198
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:14,840
Speaker 5:  I'm, I'm I'm taking the hes tour off the table. So that's it. We're

1199
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,120
Speaker 6:  Gonna get zero emails about that. So what's your better idea?

1200
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:20,280
Speaker 5:  We did get some emails from some Android Gamers.

1201
01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:23,840
Speaker 5:  We'll collate those and talk about those. It'll, it'll later

1202
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:24,920
Speaker 6:  Once there's more than one.

1203
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:30,080
Speaker 5:  That's basically what I'm saying. I don't wanna dox the

1204
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:33,960
Speaker 5:  one person who emailed me. Yeah. So what

1205
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:37,600
Speaker 5:  we've got send some more of those. But if you've got ideas on like what the

1206
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,640
Speaker 5:  first wave of Vision Pro, I'm, I'm very curious.

1207
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:43,240
Speaker 6:  Can Wait, can I tell you what my idea is? I've actually, I I I have been

1208
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:46,840
Speaker 6:  thinking a lot about this And I actually think I'm right. I think there's

1209
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:50,600
Speaker 6:  going to be this like gigantic genre of what amounts to like

1210
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:54,520
Speaker 6:  fidget spinner apps in the vision Pro ne And I. You And I

1211
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:57,880
Speaker 6:  have both gotten this demo. And just the thing where you can sit there and

1212
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:01,400
Speaker 6:  just like touch your fingers together to do stuff is

1213
01:09:01,530 --> 01:09:04,800
Speaker 6:  delightful. And I. Think about like the, do you guys remember that app when

1214
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,480
Speaker 6:  the iPhone first came out? That was just a beer on the screen and you could

1215
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,120
Speaker 6:  like sl it back Yeah. And forth. Oh yeah.

1216
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:10,120
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah.

1217
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:13,560
Speaker 6:  That thing was like, oh, look at the accelerometer. This is cool. It does

1218
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:16,120
Speaker 6:  stuff when I move it, the equivalent of that on the Vision Pro is gonna be

1219
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,440
Speaker 6:  like, I put my fingers together and something happens. So it's gonna be like,

1220
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:21,440
Speaker 6:  there's gonna be a bubble wrap app that makes a billion dollars. There's

1221
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:24,520
Speaker 6:  gonna be one of the little like popper fidget things that's gonna make a

1222
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,480
Speaker 6:  ton like spin something around with your finger. Like it's gonna be huge.

1223
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:32,240
Speaker 5:  Yeah. This is what I'm saying. The person who's all mad at me like doesn't

1224
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:36,160
Speaker 5:  miss the point. The point is when you have a bunch of new interface concepts,

1225
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:40,000
Speaker 5:  the first round of apps is just, can you trigger all the

1226
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,920
Speaker 5:  sensors and push all the buttons? Right. And that trains everybody to

1227
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:47,360
Speaker 5:  get excited about what else they can build. And the way that the first round

1228
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,960
Speaker 5:  of iPhone apps was like, turn the phone sideways and it looks like you're

1229
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,240
Speaker 5:  pouring a beer like that didn't accomplish anything other than

1230
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:57,120
Speaker 5:  getting people used to motion controls on an iPhone.

1231
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:57,440
Speaker 6:  Totally.

1232
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:01,520
Speaker 5:  And like something like that will happen. The first, I guarantee you, the

1233
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:04,840
Speaker 5:  first round of Vision Pro apps is gonna be more stuff like that. I can't

1234
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:08,160
Speaker 5:  say it's gonna be champion story presidential glory,

1235
01:10:10,230 --> 01:10:13,520
Speaker 5:  just not a, not a clear business model path.

1236
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:17,040
Speaker 5:  But you can see how some of this stuff will happen. All right. Lightning

1237
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:20,920
Speaker 5:  round Cranz, you've got LK 99, which is the

1238
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:24,640
Speaker 5:  fakest story. This I, can I say this? I will say

1239
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,920
Speaker 5:  The LK 99 situation, like exemplifies

1240
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:30,720
Speaker 5:  broken Twitter to the Max. Yes.

1241
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,280
Speaker 7:  Hmm. A hundred percent.

1242
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:36,360
Speaker 5:  Like it exists because Twitter decided it would exist and

1243
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:40,000
Speaker 5:  like no one could stop it. And then we all talk about it and then go ahead.

1244
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,160
Speaker 5:  You got it. It's you. Yeah.

1245
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:42,040
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It felt very,

1246
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:48,000
Speaker 7:  if people understood how how science is normally reported and how

1247
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,120
Speaker 7:  major discoveries are normally reported, they would've been a little less

1248
01:10:51,170 --> 01:10:54,480
Speaker 7:  hyped about this. Because generally speaking, when science has really cool

1249
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:57,520
Speaker 7:  big discoveries, they like to be like, Hey, look at these really cool big

1250
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,680
Speaker 7:  discoveries we have. They don't like to leak to

1251
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:05,040
Speaker 7:  competing studies on the same product

1252
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:09,600
Speaker 7:  to a different forum and then have everybody argue over whether

1253
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,760
Speaker 7:  it's real or not and have very little proof. That's the opposite of science.

1254
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:16,720
Speaker 7:  Everybody who was like, it's all a conspiracy. No, they

1255
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:20,200
Speaker 7:  were incorrect. But LK 99 was, was is a substance.

1256
01:11:20,570 --> 01:11:23,080
Speaker 7:  There were a number of developers who came out and they said, oh, this could

1257
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:26,280
Speaker 7:  be the next superconductor. And, and the important thing about superconductors,

1258
01:11:26,430 --> 01:11:29,720
Speaker 7:  they're really, really good at conducting electricity at room temperature,

1259
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:34,500
Speaker 7:  at normal pressure. Most superconductors cannot do that. We have

1260
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:38,220
Speaker 7:  superconductors today, but they usually have like thermal or, or pressure

1261
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:42,060
Speaker 7:  issues and which makes them really, really like great to use, but really,

1262
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:45,700
Speaker 7:  really expensive to use. So something that just works at

1263
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:49,620
Speaker 7:  normal ti like out of the box is a huge, huge idea. And

1264
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:53,220
Speaker 7:  one of the things that like tells a superconductor from other things

1265
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:57,060
Speaker 7:  is the ability to levitate over magnets. But those aren't the only

1266
01:11:57,380 --> 01:12:01,260
Speaker 7:  materials that levitate over magnets. So when everybody saw this partially,

1267
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:05,140
Speaker 7:  not even fully partially levitating, they're like, oh my God, it's a

1268
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:08,940
Speaker 7:  superconductor. And it turns out that, oh my God, it's not,

1269
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:13,060
Speaker 7:  it's just one of those materials that levitates over magnets. And it sounds

1270
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:16,180
Speaker 7:  like there's definitely some cool use cases for it. It sounds like there's

1271
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:19,940
Speaker 7:  some interesting things here, but the researchers one, some of the researchers

1272
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:23,540
Speaker 7:  already were trying to like sell it. And so this was part of their marketing

1273
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:27,460
Speaker 7:  hype to like sell it. And the other researchers were not. And the

1274
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:31,260
Speaker 7:  superconductor research space was already dealing with some drama.

1275
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:33,700
Speaker 7:  'cause some other people had previously claimed,

1276
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:37,300
Speaker 5:  Wait, can you just say can the superconductor research space was already

1277
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:38,100
Speaker 5:  dealing with some

1278
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:39,340
Speaker 6:  Drama. Incredible. Oh

1279
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:43,140
Speaker 7:  Yeah. There was already drama because there was already another like study

1280
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:46,100
Speaker 7:  that was like, oh yeah, we've got the new superconductor. And it turned out

1281
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:49,860
Speaker 7:  it was all fake and wrong and terrible. So like people keep coming

1282
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:53,340
Speaker 7:  into this space because it's, it's very pro, like it's the potential for

1283
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:56,500
Speaker 7:  profit's huge here. So everybody wants to find that

1284
01:12:56,500 --> 01:13:00,020
Speaker 7:  superconductor and then make lots of money. Wait,

1285
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:03,540
Speaker 6:  Can I, can I ask a really dumb question? I, I confess I have like not really

1286
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:07,020
Speaker 6:  followed this story because the night I sat down and was like, I'm gonna

1287
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:10,860
Speaker 6:  read the hell out of LK 99 was the same day. Everybody was like,

1288
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:13,780
Speaker 6:  nevermind, this is nothing. So I basically have not followed this story at

1289
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:17,140
Speaker 6:  all. Okay. And this is where I ask a very dumb question about superconductors,

1290
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:20,020
Speaker 6:  which is like, let's say in theory this had been the thing that some of these

1291
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:20,700
Speaker 6:  people thought it was.

1292
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,580
Speaker 6:  So what, like why did this become such a like

1293
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:29,420
Speaker 6:  real world excitement phenomenon so fast?

1294
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:33,260
Speaker 7:  I think the, the, the big thing for superconductors and and where it would

1295
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:36,580
Speaker 7:  be really powerful is like right now superconductors are used in a lot of

1296
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:40,500
Speaker 7:  power plants and stuff like that. But if you can get a cheap,

1297
01:13:41,590 --> 01:13:45,420
Speaker 7:  super reliable superconductor, which if this had been one

1298
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:48,900
Speaker 7:  would've ticked those boxes, right? It would've been cheap, it would've been

1299
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:52,820
Speaker 7:  easy to produce. If you can do that, then you can conceivably

1300
01:13:52,930 --> 01:13:56,820
Speaker 7:  make like electric cars, anything that runs on power just way

1301
01:13:56,820 --> 01:14:00,540
Speaker 7:  more efficient because it's able to move that with and, and without like

1302
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:03,460
Speaker 7:  as much heat and stuff like that, it's super efficiently.

1303
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:06,420
Speaker 6:  So instead in theory of doing what we do with Silicon now, which is only

1304
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:09,420
Speaker 6:  a semiconductor, you could do it much better with a superconductor. Right?

1305
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:13,480
Speaker 7:  You could do it so, so much better. And, and so like, it would

1306
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:17,160
Speaker 7:  just make things way faster. It would make things way less power

1307
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:20,800
Speaker 7:  hungry. Like it would be in a lot of ways magic. Yeah.

1308
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:21,160
Speaker 7:  But

1309
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,080
Speaker 5:  I just want to give you this quote from our piece, which is if you start

1310
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,560
Speaker 5:  with a rock, you end up with a rock.

1311
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:32,160
Speaker 7:  Yeah. And this was the thing. Beautiful. And what I didn't get about the

1312
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:35,640
Speaker 7:  Twitter side of this was how so many people were like, this is crazy. It's

1313
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:38,360
Speaker 7:  so cool. And then they'd go talk to researchers. The researchers are like,

1314
01:14:38,610 --> 01:14:42,120
Speaker 7:  we're skeptical. And they're like, you're in the pocket of somebody you hate

1315
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,360
Speaker 7:  science. And it's like, yeah,

1316
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:46,600
Speaker 5:  This is what I mean about twi like the broken

1317
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:51,160
Speaker 5:  blue check version of Twitter that we have now, like

1318
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:55,440
Speaker 5:  is made for hype cycles. Yeah. And it

1319
01:14:55,970 --> 01:14:59,640
Speaker 5:  every kind of like crypto scammer AI thread Boy

1320
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:04,400
Speaker 5:  had a moment with LK 99 and the media still organized around

1321
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:08,120
Speaker 5:  having Twitter be its assignment editor that this obviously

1322
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:12,320
Speaker 5:  fake thing like ended up everywhere. Like

1323
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,760
Speaker 5:  we wrote about it. 'cause there was so much interest in it. Yeah.

1324
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,920
Speaker 7:  We, we weren't gonna write it. Like we, we talked about this when it first

1325
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,560
Speaker 7:  popped off and we're like, oh, we're not gonna write about it because there,

1326
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:24,520
Speaker 7:  'cause all of the reasons that I talked about, which was didn't seem reliable

1327
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:27,200
Speaker 7:  and everything else, but then so many people were writing about it were like,

1328
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:30,520
Speaker 7:  okay, well we have to like explain how this is all incorrect and they're

1329
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:34,440
Speaker 7:  wrong and that this isn't a big deal. Which is the a bummer

1330
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:35,480
Speaker 7:  of a story to write. Yeah.

1331
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:39,440
Speaker 5:  I mean, I'm gonna quote Michael Norman, distinguished fellow and former director

1332
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:42,600
Speaker 5:  of material science division at the Oregon on National Laboratory. When you

1333
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:46,200
Speaker 5:  start with a rock, chances are you will end up with a rock.

1334
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:46,880
Speaker 6:  That's awesome.

1335
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:51,200
Speaker 5:  It's a, it's a it's a rock. But it's just like, to me, the thing was, I mean,

1336
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,960
Speaker 5:  it's interesting to capture the imagination you love capturing. It's like

1337
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:57,400
Speaker 5:  every so often, I remember early in my, like in Gadget 10 tenure as like

1338
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:01,320
Speaker 5:  a baby blogger. Someone had claimed to have invented a perpetual

1339
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:03,810
Speaker 5:  motion machine and like,

1340
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:08,010
Speaker 5:  but like You know they were gonna like hold a video demonstration and they

1341
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:11,010
Speaker 5:  called them the thing. And like, we were like, I was just like, guys, this

1342
01:16:11,010 --> 01:16:14,610
Speaker 5:  is bullshit. Like look at it. And there was this answer,

1343
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:17,690
Speaker 5:  which I still think about all the time, which is the audience is interested

1344
01:16:17,690 --> 01:16:20,890
Speaker 5:  and it's a service to go and ask the questions and blah blah blah. And I

1345
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:22,770
Speaker 5:  was like, but we can just answer the questions now.

1346
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,130
Speaker 5:  Like, it's definitely not gonna work.

1347
01:16:26,330 --> 01:16:27,090
Speaker 7:  I'm just say it's bullshit.

1348
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:31,450
Speaker 5:  It, it didn't work in the end. Surprise. But it's just like this cycle.

1349
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:35,170
Speaker 5:  But because Twitter's in the middle of it, like the idea that something has

1350
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:38,930
Speaker 5:  gone viral on Twitter still carries meaning in the world

1351
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:43,090
Speaker 5:  even though the, the the meaning is sort of divorced from the

1352
01:16:43,290 --> 01:16:47,090
Speaker 5:  mechanics of Twitter. Yeah. And so it's like, oh yeah, like a bunch of like

1353
01:16:47,570 --> 01:16:51,490
Speaker 5:  Grifters started doing Threads about what it means for there to be a room

1354
01:16:51,490 --> 01:16:55,250
Speaker 5:  temperature superconductor and without ever verifying that there was a room

1355
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:57,250
Speaker 5:  temperature superconductor. And then everybody wrote about it because everyone

1356
01:16:57,250 --> 01:17:00,450
Speaker 5:  was excited, including our audience basically asked us to write a book. Yeah.

1357
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:00,690
Speaker 5:  It

1358
01:17:00,690 --> 01:17:04,530
Speaker 6:  Makes me think of all the TikTok trends that like parents and schools get

1359
01:17:04,530 --> 01:17:08,010
Speaker 6:  terrified about that weren't actually trends, but it was just like one person

1360
01:17:08,010 --> 01:17:10,940
Speaker 6:  made a video and then some some person made a video warning you about the

1361
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:14,160
Speaker 6:  video and then everybody latched onto that. Yeah. And it's like this was

1362
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:17,240
Speaker 6:  never actually a thing that kids were doing, but now we're afraid of the

1363
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:18,760
Speaker 6:  thing that kids aren't doing. If you go to the

1364
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:19,240
Speaker 5:  Original video,

1365
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:20,240
Speaker 6:  It is bad news.

1366
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:23,560
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I it's the, it's the, I call it the local news cycle. Once when I,

1367
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:27,040
Speaker 5:  as a child in Wisconsin, the local news once reported the kids were getting

1368
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:30,760
Speaker 5:  high by drinking too much water, which is a real thing that you can do. I

1369
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:33,240
Speaker 5:  have since learned and my mom was like, how much water have you been drinking?

1370
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:36,920
Speaker 5:  And I was like, not enough bro. It's, I've been drinking a lot of Miller

1371
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:37,760
Speaker 5:  Light. Like

1372
01:17:39,430 --> 01:17:42,200
Speaker 6:  Yeah, she's not worried about that though. The water's the problem.

1373
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:43,840
Speaker 5:  Anyhow,

1374
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:49,280
Speaker 5:  I've got a quick update on the MrBeast situation. You recall last

1375
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:53,080
Speaker 5:  week, MrBeast sued the company that was doing his

1376
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:56,320
Speaker 5:  ghost kitchens for MrBeast burgers trying to get outta the contract. 'cause

1377
01:17:56,320 --> 01:18:00,200
Speaker 5:  there was no quality control surprise. They have now sued him back

1378
01:18:00,230 --> 01:18:03,920
Speaker 5:  $400 million saying that he's got more value out of

1379
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:06,600
Speaker 5:  them and he's become more famous because of the

1380
01:18:08,210 --> 01:18:11,330
Speaker 5:  burgers. I don't know man. I just, that that's your lightning round update.

1381
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:14,930
Speaker 5:  I think MrBeast versus the Burger company is, it's like

1382
01:18:14,970 --> 01:18:18,830
Speaker 5:  the pinnacle of influencer culture in a way. It it is directly related

1383
01:18:18,830 --> 01:18:21,390
Speaker 5:  to like the, there are a lot of thread

1384
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:26,070
Speaker 5:  boys threading on the tweets about how MrBeast Burger was like the future

1385
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:29,470
Speaker 5:  of dining. Oh yeah. All of those people should be forced to apologize.

1386
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:34,520
Speaker 5:  Here's my theory. If you were a thread person on Twitter doing Threads like

1387
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:38,080
Speaker 5:  that, and then you wanna join Instagram Threads Instagram should

1388
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:42,000
Speaker 5:  enforce that. You have to post 50 apologies first and

1389
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:43,720
Speaker 6:  Eat 50 Beast Burgers

1390
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:47,480
Speaker 5:  And Eat 50 be you have to do a Beast Burger challenge

1391
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:52,640
Speaker 5:  for if you have ever written a one of 99

1392
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:56,600
Speaker 5:  Twitter thread about how MrBeast Burger was the future of

1393
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:00,240
Speaker 5:  dining, I think, I think you should have your platform credentials revoked

1394
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,280
Speaker 5:  until you eat 50 Beast

1395
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:05,120
Speaker 6:  Burgers. I like it. I will say, listen, I'm not a lawyer, but the, the idea

1396
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:09,080
Speaker 6:  that MrBeast is only famous because of the burgers does not make a lot of

1397
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:09,480
Speaker 6:  sense to me.

1398
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:13,600
Speaker 5:  Does not fly. It's also, by the way, his actual work,

1399
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:17,880
Speaker 5:  it is clear he cares a lot about the quality of his

1400
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:21,720
Speaker 5:  actual work. Yep. Like a MrBeast video is like a

1401
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:26,200
Speaker 5:  rigorously edited jewel of a thing. Yeah. And it's like,

1402
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:29,160
Speaker 5:  you can see why he's pissed. The burgers are wrong.

1403
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:35,230
Speaker 5:  It's just like very obvious. Anyhow. All right, David, what's

1404
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:35,390
Speaker 5:  yours?

1405
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:39,550
Speaker 6:  Mine is just a small Threads update, which is

1406
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:43,550
Speaker 6:  a very cool little thing that happened where you can now use

1407
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:47,830
Speaker 6:  your Mastodon profile and your Threads profile essentially

1408
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:51,270
Speaker 6:  as verification systems. So you can, you can go to Mastodon

1409
01:19:51,690 --> 01:19:55,390
Speaker 6:  and say, You know my Threads account is this, and then actually use your

1410
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:59,150
Speaker 6:  Threads account to verify that, which at a very small level

1411
01:19:59,210 --> 01:20:02,950
Speaker 6:  is like, it doesn't matter, it's like a teeny tiny feature. But it is, and

1412
01:20:02,950 --> 01:20:06,470
Speaker 6:  Instagram people have been saying this is the first sort of

1413
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:10,200
Speaker 6:  meaningful step Threads has made into like the

1414
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:13,920
Speaker 6:  activity pub decentralized social media world. And yeah,

1415
01:20:14,130 --> 01:20:17,000
Speaker 6:  we've said a bunch of times, like there are lots of reasons to believe Threads

1416
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,200
Speaker 6:  will never decentralize in the way that it has promised, but the people who

1417
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:24,080
Speaker 6:  are building the thing continues who loudly say they are going to do it.

1418
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:28,080
Speaker 6:  And this was sort of the first like real world instantiation of that

1419
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:29,400
Speaker 6:  And I think That's very exciting.

1420
01:20:29,630 --> 01:20:32,920
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And it's cool. I mean, it is like a very little thing, but it is true

1421
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:36,600
Speaker 5:  that Thread's engineers were posting like, hope you believe us. Like

1422
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:38,120
Speaker 5:  we're taking these baby steps. They

1423
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:42,010
Speaker 7:  Were so proud about it. It just makes me happy that like how excited people

1424
01:20:42,010 --> 01:20:45,850
Speaker 7:  were for it. I'm not excited for it, but everyone was so just pumped. I don't

1425
01:20:45,850 --> 01:20:45,930
Speaker 7:  care.

1426
01:20:46,230 --> 01:20:47,290
Speaker 11:  But everybody else was so

1427
01:20:47,290 --> 01:20:50,530
Speaker 6:  Pumped. So I just wanna say by the way, the, the, every time I write about

1428
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:54,450
Speaker 6:  this stuff or talk about it on a show like this, the overwhelming

1429
01:20:54,810 --> 01:20:58,650
Speaker 6:  response is people don't care about decentralized platforms. That's not how

1430
01:20:58,650 --> 01:21:02,370
Speaker 6:  you win user experience, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And that's a

1431
01:21:02,650 --> 01:21:06,290
Speaker 6:  stupid argument. People didn't care about anything until they

1432
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:09,610
Speaker 6:  realized why it was cool and started using it. That's how things work.

1433
01:21:11,070 --> 01:21:14,930
Speaker 6:  And in this case, like I, I will continue to plead loudly

1434
01:21:14,930 --> 01:21:18,810
Speaker 6:  that decentralized social media is a good idea and we should pursue it.

1435
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:22,490
Speaker 6:  And you should care as a person because it will make better

1436
01:21:22,490 --> 01:21:26,410
Speaker 6:  products and a better internet. And my number one

1437
01:21:26,410 --> 01:21:30,170
Speaker 6:  goal in life is to convince random strangers that decentralized social

1438
01:21:30,170 --> 01:21:33,050
Speaker 6:  media is a concept they should care about. So I here I can

1439
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:36,850
Speaker 5:  Well, no, it's, I'll give you the, I'll just flip that around. These

1440
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:38,730
Speaker 5:  clowns forced us to care about crypto,

1441
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:45,490
Speaker 5:  Right? Like they, the money that

1442
01:21:45,670 --> 01:21:48,930
Speaker 5:  flowed into that ecosystem to try to force us to care about it.

1443
01:21:49,630 --> 01:21:53,450
Speaker 5:  And we to The Verge and The Vergecast audience

1444
01:21:53,590 --> 01:21:57,570
Speaker 5:  by and large was like, don't care about this. Like fully rejected.

1445
01:21:59,110 --> 01:22:02,570
Speaker 5:  But it's weird that because there's not that much money in the system

1446
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:06,570
Speaker 5:  that people are like, no one will ever care about this. And like, I just,

1447
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:11,170
Speaker 5:  it's the things are not user experiences. The things are

1448
01:22:11,170 --> 01:22:15,010
Speaker 5:  the things that enable other people to make products and services that

1449
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:17,850
Speaker 5:  compete, which is the thing that we care about the

1450
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:21,010
Speaker 6:  Most. Yeah. It's like, it's like the moment that the Open web started to

1451
01:22:21,010 --> 01:22:23,970
Speaker 6:  beat a o l there were probably bunch of people who are like, who cares? Everybody's

1452
01:22:23,970 --> 01:22:27,570
Speaker 6:  on a o l And it's like, no, this other thing is better. Yeah. And like, give

1453
01:22:27,570 --> 01:22:30,410
Speaker 6:  me a minute and I'll prove it to you. And like that's how I feel about the

1454
01:22:30,410 --> 01:22:32,010
Speaker 6:  future of social stuff right now. And

1455
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:33,850
Speaker 5:  At the end of the day, Twitter's gonna buy Time Warner.

1456
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:36,730
Speaker 11:  It's,

1457
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:40,690
Speaker 5:  It's the final form of Twitter is they're also gonna own Batman

1458
01:22:40,710 --> 01:22:44,630
Speaker 5:  for some reason. All right. The last one we got You

1459
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:45,870
Speaker 5:  know I had to end here. Yeah,

1460
01:22:46,130 --> 01:22:47,070
Speaker 6:  It feels right. Yeah.

1461
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:48,350
Speaker 7:  Unfortunately

1462
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:52,550
Speaker 5:  There's a new ev Escalade, it's called the Escalade IQ. I love it.

1463
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:57,480
Speaker 5:  It's so expensive. It's $130,000, but it is

1464
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:58,960
Speaker 5:  hot. It's, and it's huge. It's the biggest

1465
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:00,040
Speaker 6:  Car's. It a massive car.

1466
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:03,600
Speaker 5:  It's ridiculous. It's so big. It's not as big as the escalated is feed. It's

1467
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:06,040
Speaker 5:  not as big as the big as Escalade, but it's still huge. It's bigger than

1468
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:09,640
Speaker 5:  a regular Escalade. Three rows, beautiful.

1469
01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:13,520
Speaker 5:  450 miles of range mostly. 'cause the battery is the size of a Sherman tank

1470
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:17,880
Speaker 5:  has a Crabwalk mode Oh yeah. That the Hummer ev has. So it can like go

1471
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:21,600
Speaker 5:  sideways. The thing's cool. $130,000. I sent a photo of it

1472
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:25,480
Speaker 5:  to Becky with just the words Hear me out. And she wrote, that's hot. Oh

1473
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:27,280
Speaker 6:  Congratulations. Good. Right?

1474
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:31,760
Speaker 5:  I was like, what if we sell everything and buy an ev Escalade? And she was

1475
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:35,600
Speaker 5:  like, I'll think about it. It's hot. Go look at pictures. GM,

1476
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:39,120
Speaker 5:  they've been saying this is gonna happen. No CarPlay, huge

1477
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:43,160
Speaker 5:  screens on the inside, the inside of his car looks hot. It's like wall to

1478
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:43,840
Speaker 5:  wall screens.

1479
01:23:44,030 --> 01:23:45,960
Speaker 6:  It's a 55 inch screen across.

1480
01:23:46,150 --> 01:23:49,440
Speaker 5:  Yeah, it's an L E D L C D that wraps around the sort of climate

1481
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:52,800
Speaker 5:  clusters. Another screen in the back, there's a third screen

1482
01:23:53,310 --> 01:23:57,120
Speaker 5:  screens for days and they're saying no CarPlay Android Auto. Again. They

1483
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:00,520
Speaker 5:  said this was gonna happen ages ago. No one believed them. Here's the new

1484
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:04,560
Speaker 5:  Escalade and they've done it. Now, importantly, Google built

1485
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:08,280
Speaker 5:  in. So you get Google Maps, you get Google all the stuff that you might

1486
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:12,120
Speaker 5:  want off a phone, but no Android or a CarPlay. I don't know if this is a

1487
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:15,850
Speaker 5:  good idea. I haven't used it, haven't seen the car. Many

1488
01:24:16,130 --> 01:24:19,930
Speaker 5:  questions. But this is the moment when big car makers say,

1489
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:23,730
Speaker 5:  when Cadillac says You, know what you're gonna buy an Escalade with or without

1490
01:24:23,730 --> 01:24:27,410
Speaker 5:  CarPlay also probably you're in the backseat of this Escalade fair. So it

1491
01:24:27,410 --> 01:24:30,290
Speaker 5:  doesn't matter. But like they're, they're betting

1492
01:24:31,030 --> 01:24:34,330
Speaker 5:  people are gonna buy Escalades without CarPlay because of what they want

1493
01:24:34,330 --> 01:24:34,890
Speaker 5:  is an Escalade.

1494
01:24:34,890 --> 01:24:38,770
Speaker 6:  Okay. Nila, you were obligated by law to think this is a good idea. So

1495
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:42,530
Speaker 6:  congratulations. What I would just say is, I know I came

1496
01:24:42,530 --> 01:24:46,010
Speaker 6:  back to the show and said that I, I agree that CarPlay is bad, but the thing

1497
01:24:46,010 --> 01:24:49,770
Speaker 6:  is, I'm looking at the picture of this screen right now and it, it essentially,

1498
01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:53,490
Speaker 6:  if I can describe it, it basically the, the photo I've seen here in our piece

1499
01:24:53,490 --> 01:24:57,410
Speaker 6:  looks like sort of three distinct sides. One

1500
01:24:57,410 --> 01:25:01,250
Speaker 6:  side shows like nav and car information. The

1501
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:03,930
Speaker 6:  middle is kind of classic infotainment. And on the right

1502
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:08,970
Speaker 6:  is, I don't know, like a 15 inch across screen

1503
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:13,090
Speaker 6:  that just has seven icons. Like this, this is what we're doing with our screens.

1504
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:17,130
Speaker 6:  Like here's seven icons. This is awful. This is

1505
01:25:17,130 --> 01:25:19,610
Speaker 6:  the worst UI design I've ever seen in my life.

1506
01:25:19,870 --> 01:25:23,650
Speaker 5:  Oh no, you, you, no, no. So you're looking at that, that's like a menu screen.

1507
01:25:23,990 --> 01:25:27,250
Speaker 5:  So I, I think again, I have not seen this car.

1508
01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:30,770
Speaker 5:  So the screen all the way in the right is in front of the passenger. And

1509
01:25:30,770 --> 01:25:32,570
Speaker 5:  that is basically a TV of really

1510
01:25:33,350 --> 01:25:35,370
Speaker 6:  Skinny candy bar television.

1511
01:25:35,370 --> 01:25:38,050
Speaker 5:  Yeah. It's, it's a really weird TV with,

1512
01:25:38,350 --> 01:25:40,130
Speaker 7:  It looks like it's got H D M I

1513
01:25:40,130 --> 01:25:43,610
Speaker 5:  Input. It does have, I have one of these in my car. So we have a Jeep with

1514
01:25:43,610 --> 01:25:47,210
Speaker 5:  a passenger screen. It has a, it has a with h filter on the front of it,

1515
01:25:47,230 --> 01:25:51,170
Speaker 5:  so you can't see it from the driver's seat. And it has HT m i n and some

1516
01:25:51,370 --> 01:25:55,180
Speaker 5:  apps. Great. Like we've, I've used it once

1517
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:58,820
Speaker 5:  to Stream a football game to that thing. And the entire time I just told

1518
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:02,820
Speaker 5:  my wife that I was watching football and she's like, I don't care. You often

1519
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:06,040
Speaker 5:  do that on your phone anyway. But I was like, now it's in the car. Like Yeah.

1520
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:09,760
Speaker 5:  But that's what that thing over there in front of the passenger is, is this

1521
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:13,200
Speaker 5:  belief the car industry has that passengers want a dedicated screen that

1522
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:14,360
Speaker 5:  play that is a tv Well

1523
01:26:14,390 --> 01:26:17,480
Speaker 6:  It's a dedicated screen for them to put ads on. Yeah. Which is all fine and

1524
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:20,760
Speaker 6:  good. I'm just saying these software designed here is garbage.

1525
01:26:21,470 --> 01:26:23,200
Speaker 7:  Yeah. The UI ugly.

1526
01:26:23,590 --> 01:26:27,480
Speaker 5:  Yeah. I mean, again, we have not seen the thing, so I

1527
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:30,880
Speaker 5:  don't know what mode that is in, but you're right, you've got a thing that

1528
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,800
Speaker 5:  is a cluster all the way on the left. Like that's the instrument cluster.

1529
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:38,080
Speaker 5:  You've got your standard infotainment and then there's a set of new

1530
01:26:38,210 --> 01:26:42,200
Speaker 5:  ideas on the right of the car that honestly no

1531
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:45,120
Speaker 5:  one in the car industry has figured out. But there should be a screen in

1532
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:48,880
Speaker 5:  front of the passenger that is a tv just watch. It's, it's coming

1533
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:49,560
Speaker 5:  to all of the cars.

1534
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:53,440
Speaker 6:  And there's another screen right in front of the gear shift or like, this

1535
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:53,960
Speaker 6:  is, this is

1536
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:57,600
Speaker 5:  Just, that's the, that's the weird, crazy info. That's the climate control

1537
01:26:57,740 --> 01:26:57,960
Speaker 5:  and

1538
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:01,720
Speaker 6:  Ah, because 'cause you don't have that in the other 55 inches. I just

1539
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:04,040
Speaker 7:  Worry about these. Nope. Freezing.

1540
01:27:04,210 --> 01:27:07,280
Speaker 5:  Right? So like, here's what we don't know. Is this fast? Is it responsive?

1541
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:10,920
Speaker 5:  Is the interface good? David thinks the interface is bad. What I, we, we

1542
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:14,640
Speaker 5:  have spent but a few minutes looking at this thing. My point is

1543
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:20,080
Speaker 5:  GM's position, And I guarantee you many, many more car makers

1544
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:23,920
Speaker 5:  position over time is going to be, we are not letting

1545
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:27,890
Speaker 5:  Apple take over the user experience of our vehicles. And

1546
01:27:28,390 --> 01:27:31,370
Speaker 5:  we think in particular, I think GM thinks with the Escalade,

1547
01:27:32,430 --> 01:27:36,130
Speaker 5:  the people will buy Escalades even without car plan Android Auto

1548
01:27:36,130 --> 01:27:38,730
Speaker 5:  because it has Google Maps, which is the thing that people care about the

1549
01:27:38,730 --> 01:27:42,610
Speaker 5:  most. And that's gonna be that Rivian is already

1550
01:27:42,610 --> 01:27:46,250
Speaker 5:  there. Tesla has been there forever. And I think they're, they're basically

1551
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:50,130
Speaker 5:  looking at what people are doing on these phone apps or on these phone projection

1552
01:27:50,130 --> 01:27:54,010
Speaker 5:  systems and saying, You know what, by and large they are running Google Maps.

1553
01:27:54,390 --> 01:27:57,130
Speaker 5:  So if we just sign the deal with Google and run Google Maps on our thing.

1554
01:27:57,190 --> 01:28:00,610
Speaker 5:  Yep. We can run ads on the weird Hulu integration over on the right.

1555
01:28:01,110 --> 01:28:05,090
Speaker 5:  Yes, we can like You know as EV charging networks, blah blah blah. We

1556
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:08,130
Speaker 5:  can like monitor the cars better, we can do telemetry, you can sell your

1557
01:28:08,130 --> 01:28:11,370
Speaker 5:  data, all that stuff. That seems kind of gross. But fundamentally they're

1558
01:28:11,370 --> 01:28:14,330
Speaker 5:  saying, look what you want outta, this is Google Maps and we've signed the

1559
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:17,130
Speaker 5:  deal with Google to give you Google maps and Google is waiting there with

1560
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:17,610
Speaker 5:  open arms.

1561
01:28:18,530 --> 01:28:22,210
Speaker 6:  I don't think that theory is wrong. I just don't think there is any

1562
01:28:22,490 --> 01:28:26,210
Speaker 6:  evidence in the history of cars that says car makers can make good software

1563
01:28:27,230 --> 01:28:30,570
Speaker 7:  Or the history of TVs. Like this is the exact same thing TVs have done,

1564
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:34,850
Speaker 7:  TVs have been doing this for ages. They're like, we're gonna do it. Samsung

1565
01:28:35,290 --> 01:28:39,130
Speaker 7:  ties in and then you go buy an Apple TV and you plug it in and you go

1566
01:28:39,130 --> 01:28:42,970
Speaker 7:  away and you just can't do that with this because I guess you plug your it

1567
01:28:42,970 --> 01:28:44,610
Speaker 7:  into the H D M I port. Yeah,

1568
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:47,850
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You can just plug your phone into H m I port and run off your phone.

1569
01:28:48,350 --> 01:28:51,970
Speaker 5:  But only on that screen the passenger gets, we'll see it's

1570
01:28:52,010 --> 01:28:55,850
Speaker 5:  $130,000 ev Escalade, like the

1571
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:59,890
Speaker 5:  risk profile for this car is very low. I think the people who

1572
01:28:59,890 --> 01:29:03,720
Speaker 5:  are gonna spend 130,000 thousand dollars on ev Sade have people who use

1573
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:04,560
Speaker 5:  their phones for them.

1574
01:29:04,670 --> 01:29:06,400
Speaker 6:  Fair. That's gonna be you someday Meli. And

1575
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:07,160
Speaker 5:  That's my dream.

1576
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,520
Speaker 6:  Yeah. We're gonna get the Becky review of this car someday.

1577
01:29:10,990 --> 01:29:14,720
Speaker 5:  It's gonna be great. Alright. That's it. David, you have a new newsletter?

1578
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:15,040
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah.

1579
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:17,920
Speaker 6:  That's, if you're listening to this on Friday,

1580
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:22,720
Speaker 6:  you have one day to sign up. It's called Installer. And the idea

1581
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:26,880
Speaker 6:  was basically to just take all of the cool stuff on the internet

1582
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:31,240
Speaker 6:  and put it all into one place. It's like, there's like new apps

1583

01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:37,520
Speaker 6:  new like cool creators coming out all the time. And I spend a

1585
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:40,800
Speaker 6:  lot of time just like pouring this stuff into like random

1586
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:43,680
Speaker 6:  documents and never doing anything with them. And I was like, I am going

1587
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:47,400
Speaker 6:  to do better at finding new stuff and I've been asking people to

1588
