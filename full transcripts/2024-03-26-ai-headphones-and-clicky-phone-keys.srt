00:00:02,565 --> 00:00:06,415
Speaker 2:  Welcome To The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of Canceled out cricket sounds.

3
00:00:06,755 --> 00:00:10,575
Speaker 2:  I'm your friend, David Pierce, and I am sitting in my basement about to watch

4
00:00:10,815 --> 00:00:13,415
Speaker 2:  Oppenheimer. Actually, I should say that differently. I'm about to finish

5
00:00:13,935 --> 00:00:17,775
Speaker 2:  watching Oppenheimer. I have been watching this movie for months, but

6
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:21,695
Speaker 2:  something happens every time I sit down to watch Oppenheimer, which admittedly

7
00:00:21,695 --> 00:00:24,895
Speaker 2:  is like three hours long. So life is busy. It's hard to find three hours

8
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:28,455
Speaker 2:  to watch a movie, but every single time I sit down to watch this movie,

9
00:00:28,725 --> 00:00:32,615
Speaker 2:  somewhere between two and like 11 minutes later, something

10
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:36,135
Speaker 2:  happens and I have to stop watching it. It's gotten to the point where Peacock's

11
00:00:36,135 --> 00:00:39,735
Speaker 2:  algorithm took it out of my continue watching

12
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:43,695
Speaker 2:  Roe in the app because I just assumed Peacock was like, there's no way he's

13
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:46,295
Speaker 2:  ever gonna finish this movie. He can't possibly care. We'll just get rid

14
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:50,255
Speaker 2:  of it. But I do care and I'm gonna finish it. And today is the day.

15
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:54,135
Speaker 2:  It's Monday morning, which is a super weird time to watch this movie, but

16
00:00:54,135 --> 00:00:57,975
Speaker 2:  it's happening. I've got I think like 40 minutes left. Today's the

17
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:01,575
Speaker 2:  day, it's gonna be awesome. Anyway, we have an awesome show coming up for

18
00:01:01,575 --> 00:01:04,815
Speaker 2:  you today. We're gonna do two things. First, we're gonna talk about active

19
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:08,655
Speaker 2:  noise cancellation. You may have seen a video that our team made last summer

20
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:12,455
Speaker 2:  about kind of the state of the art in those, like over your headphones that

21
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:16,095
Speaker 2:  tried to cancel out subway sounds or airplane sounds or whatever else.

22
00:01:16,435 --> 00:01:20,415
Speaker 2:  but it turns out the tech and science underneath all of that is actually

23
00:01:20,415 --> 00:01:23,615
Speaker 2:  more advanced than you might see on some of those headphones. And we have

24
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:27,255
Speaker 2:  a really fun story about it. Then we're gonna talk about keyboards, specifically

25
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:31,135
Speaker 2:  iPhone keyboards, and the cases that put physical keyboards

26
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:34,575
Speaker 2:  back on your iPhone. We're actually doing, I've realized it's kind of an

27
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:38,655
Speaker 2:  accidental mini series in the next several weeks about

28
00:01:39,055 --> 00:01:41,975
Speaker 2:  keyboards, just because I think they're fascinating and we don't talk about

29
00:01:41,975 --> 00:01:45,895
Speaker 2:  them enough. The ways that we talk to our devices and the tools that

30
00:01:45,895 --> 00:01:49,695
Speaker 2:  we use to do that matters a lot. Like when when we switch

31
00:01:49,695 --> 00:01:53,455
Speaker 2:  to voice, instead of typing on a keyboard, the way that we use our

32
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:57,415
Speaker 2:  devices changes. And when we switch from a physical keyboard

33
00:01:57,635 --> 00:02:01,575
Speaker 2:  to an onscreen keyboard, the way that we use our phones changes. And

34
00:02:01,575 --> 00:02:04,455
Speaker 2:  so we're gonna talk to one person who is trying to put a physical keyboard

35
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:08,455
Speaker 2:  back about how that works, what it means, and what it changes.

36
00:02:09,035 --> 00:02:12,135
Speaker 2:  All that is coming up in just a second. But like I said, I have 40 minutes

37
00:02:12,135 --> 00:02:15,935
Speaker 2:  of this movie to watch no one else's home. It's Oppenheimer time, baby.

38
00:02:16,085 --> 00:02:17,735
Speaker 2:  This is To Vergecast. We'll see you in a sec.

39
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:45,775
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. So last summer our video team made a video all

40
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:49,735
Speaker 2:  over New York City in which they carried around this crazy looking like

41
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:52,135
Speaker 2:  mannequin skull to test a bunch of headphones.

42
00:03:52,545 --> 00:03:56,455
Speaker 5:  Noise canceling is hard to explain by just talking about it, so we're gonna

43
00:03:56,475 --> 00:04:00,055
Speaker 5:  try to share with you how it sounds by putting a bunch of noise canceling

44
00:04:00,055 --> 00:04:01,935
Speaker 5:  headphones on the KU 100.

45
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:06,335
Speaker 2:  It was all about active noise cancellation and whether different

46
00:04:06,335 --> 00:04:09,335
Speaker 2:  kinds of headphones could hold up. Super fun video. one of the best things

47
00:04:09,335 --> 00:04:13,055
Speaker 2:  we made last year, and I'm told that's actually only the very beginning of

48
00:04:13,115 --> 00:04:17,095
Speaker 2:  the story of what ANC can do Will pour is here to help me explain. Will.

49
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:17,455
Speaker 2:  Hello?

50
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:18,175
Speaker 6:  Hello.

51
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:22,695
Speaker 2:  Will. You made this video last summer and as far as I can

52
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:25,535
Speaker 2:  tell you have not stopped thinking about it ever since. Is that a, is that

53
00:04:25,535 --> 00:04:27,895
Speaker 2:  a fair characterization of what's been going on? Yeah,

54
00:04:27,945 --> 00:04:31,655
Speaker 6:  Kinda. There was an interview we did at the very end of the video that is

55
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:35,695
Speaker 6:  the thing that really stuck in my brain. It was with this guy that runs an

56
00:04:35,695 --> 00:04:39,495
Speaker 6:  audio testing lab where we sent all these headphones and he ranked them

57
00:04:39,515 --> 00:04:43,335
Speaker 6:  for us by their ANC performance, but he also made the point

58
00:04:43,335 --> 00:04:47,255
Speaker 6:  that the most noise cancellation is maybe not what people

59
00:04:47,615 --> 00:04:51,455
Speaker 6:  actually want. Like maybe we don't wanna walk around in this total

60
00:04:51,475 --> 00:04:55,335
Speaker 6:  vacuum of sound. And he said that in The future it'll

61
00:04:55,335 --> 00:04:59,255
Speaker 6:  be about smarter noise cancellation, more user input

62
00:04:59,405 --> 00:05:03,055
Speaker 6:  into what you want to hear and what you don't. So that's the idea I've been

63
00:05:03,175 --> 00:05:03,975
Speaker 6:  carrying around with me.

64
00:05:04,445 --> 00:05:07,815
Speaker 2:  Okay. This is a good segue to a question that I have had for a very long

65
00:05:07,815 --> 00:05:11,175
Speaker 2:  time and have been too afraid to loudly ask in public, in front of people

66
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:11,855
Speaker 6:  Can't wait.

67
00:05:12,085 --> 00:05:15,695
Speaker 2:  What is active noise cancellation? I know it's a thing I sort of know

68
00:05:15,695 --> 00:05:19,575
Speaker 2:  roughly at a basic level, like there are noises and it cancels them.

69
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:23,175
Speaker 2:  Yes. What is, and there are other kinds of noise cancellation that I also

70
00:05:23,175 --> 00:05:26,015
Speaker 2:  don't understand. So like what is ANC? What are we talking about here?

71
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:30,535
Speaker 6:  I am so glad you asked and I brought Andru along because when

72
00:05:30,535 --> 00:05:34,175
Speaker 6:  we did the video I had the same question and I just immediately asked him

73
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:34,415
Speaker 6:  that.

74
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:38,575
Speaker 2:  Okay, good. Andru Moreno, welcome. Hello, what is ANC

75
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:40,175
Speaker 2:  Teach Will and I please?

76
00:05:40,385 --> 00:05:44,055
Speaker 5:  Right. So active noise cancellation takes sound

77
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:48,295
Speaker 5:  coming from the environment and basically sends an

78
00:05:48,575 --> 00:05:52,335
Speaker 5:  opposite version of that sound wave to your ear. So

79
00:05:52,605 --> 00:05:56,495
Speaker 5:  when combined it basically cancels it out. This is really

80
00:05:56,495 --> 00:06:00,245
Speaker 5:  easy to do with, sounds like a loud airplane engine

81
00:06:00,585 --> 00:06:03,885
Speaker 5:  or subway sounds noise. That's really predictable.

82
00:06:04,545 --> 00:06:08,125
Speaker 2:  So the two of you have been on this beat for a while now and

83
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:12,085
Speaker 2:  have been investigating this question of how far have we come, how far can

84
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:15,685
Speaker 2:  we go and where do we actually want to go?

85
00:06:15,905 --> 00:06:16,365
Speaker 2:  Is that right?

86
00:06:16,705 --> 00:06:20,245
Speaker 6:  That's right, yeah. When we started talking and thinking about smart

87
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:24,245
Speaker 6:  noise cancellation, I started looking for who's doing this right

88
00:06:24,305 --> 00:06:28,205
Speaker 6:  now? And the first place I looked is Apple, because their AirPods

89
00:06:28,345 --> 00:06:32,085
Speaker 6:  Pro have a bunch of these smart noise control settings they call their

90
00:06:32,485 --> 00:06:36,005
Speaker 6:  features adaptive audio. And it's kind of what we're talking about.

91
00:06:36,435 --> 00:06:40,245
Speaker 6:  It's not like full, let's just cancel out all the

92
00:06:40,245 --> 00:06:44,205
Speaker 6:  sound. It's more, let's make some basic decisions for you

93
00:06:44,415 --> 00:06:48,085
Speaker 6:  about making really loud sounds more comfortable or

94
00:06:48,235 --> 00:06:51,565
Speaker 6:  dipping your music when you start talking to someone. I, I've been playing

95
00:06:51,565 --> 00:06:55,285
Speaker 6:  around with those features a bunch and in practice it's not

96
00:06:55,285 --> 00:06:59,085
Speaker 6:  always super clear what it's actually doing. Like there's no

97
00:06:59,115 --> 00:07:02,925
Speaker 6:  fine tuning, there's no user input, you just hit the button

98
00:07:03,025 --> 00:07:06,885
Speaker 6:  and it tries to magically like make a better soundscape for you.

99
00:07:07,305 --> 00:07:11,005
Speaker 6:  So that's the like one place I looked and have been playing

100
00:07:11,115 --> 00:07:14,965
Speaker 6:  with that is out there in the world. That's a product now that that has some

101
00:07:15,065 --> 00:07:19,045
Speaker 6:  smarts. But I also played around with a really early

102
00:07:19,235 --> 00:07:22,925
Speaker 6:  prototype and I have a bunch of tape that I brought to play. Awesome.

103
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:27,045
Speaker 6:  This is super early stage a device that could get

104
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:31,205
Speaker 6:  a whole lot more specific when it comes to what you

105
00:07:31,205 --> 00:07:34,885
Speaker 6:  want to hear, what you don't want to hear. So, I wanna play some of this

106
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:36,405
Speaker 6:  stuff and we can talk about it.

107
00:07:36,475 --> 00:07:37,165
Speaker 2:  Yeah, let's go.

108
00:07:37,435 --> 00:07:40,325
Speaker 6:  Okay. So first listen to this clip.

109
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:48,725
Speaker 6:  This is me sitting at a table alone in a room.

110
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:53,365
Speaker 6:  I'm wearing these very prototype looking headphones. They've got a lot of

111
00:07:53,365 --> 00:07:56,885
Speaker 6:  extra wires and tape and circuit boards attached to them. There's a vacuum

112
00:07:56,885 --> 00:08:00,805
Speaker 6:  cleaner running right next to my chair and a few feet away there's a door

113
00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:04,885
Speaker 6:  and someone outside is knocking on that door. That sound that we just heard

114
00:08:05,065 --> 00:08:08,525
Speaker 6:  is just coming from a microphone that's sitting on the table next to me.

115
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:12,445
Speaker 6:  So that's just what the room sounds like. But while this is happening, this

116
00:08:12,455 --> 00:08:14,605
Speaker 6:  sound clip, this is what I'm hearing right now,

117
00:08:18,435 --> 00:08:19,245
Speaker 6:  just the knocks.

118
00:08:19,545 --> 00:08:20,205
Speaker 2:  That's amazing.

119
00:08:20,595 --> 00:08:24,405
Speaker 5:  This is beyond what we have seen with noise canceling headphones

120
00:08:24,465 --> 00:08:28,325
Speaker 5:  before. If, you want to just hear NOx? That is not something you

121
00:08:28,325 --> 00:08:29,725
Speaker 5:  can try to get,

122
00:08:30,145 --> 00:08:32,285
Speaker 6:  You can't tell your AirPods Pro. Just NOx,

123
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:33,885
Speaker 5:  Where did you find this?

124
00:08:34,465 --> 00:08:37,765
Speaker 6:  So this comes from The University of Washington, specifically their mobile

125
00:08:37,765 --> 00:08:41,325
Speaker 6:  intelligence lab in the CS department. It's a project that they call

126
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:45,165
Speaker 6:  Semantic Hearing. And I got this demo from a PhD student

127
00:08:45,175 --> 00:08:48,685
Speaker 6:  named Malani. He's one of the people who helped build the system.

128
00:08:49,065 --> 00:08:50,405
Speaker 6:  And you talk me through how it all works.

129
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:54,485
Speaker 9:  There are these noise canceling headphones. Okay. They're Bose, QC

130
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:58,365
Speaker 9:  Ultra. They're going to suppress all of the sounds. And then what we do is

131
00:08:58,365 --> 00:09:00,605
Speaker 9:  we have these binaural microphones that capture

132
00:09:00,605 --> 00:09:02,205
Speaker 6:  Tape tape to the outside of the,

133
00:09:02,205 --> 00:09:05,605
Speaker 9:  Yeah, okay. Yeah. They capture sound from your environment. Yeah. The way

134
00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:07,765
Speaker 9:  you hear it because they're on on both ears. Ears because they're outside.

135
00:09:07,795 --> 00:09:11,565
Speaker 9:  Yeah. And then we pass this through a mobile CPU and orange

136
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:15,405
Speaker 9:  pie. This thing processes audio in some way based on the

137
00:09:15,405 --> 00:09:18,445
Speaker 9:  targets that you select. Okay. And then feeds it back to the headphones where

138
00:09:18,445 --> 00:09:18,805
Speaker 9:  it's played.

139
00:09:19,345 --> 00:09:22,365
Speaker 2:  So the starting point for this is a pair of headphones you actually can buy?

140
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:26,485
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So the prototype starts with off the shelf bodes headphones

141
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:30,125
Speaker 6:  that use the existing ANC to just create a clean

142
00:09:30,175 --> 00:09:34,165
Speaker 6:  audio slate. I see. And then the system on that orange pie

143
00:09:34,555 --> 00:09:38,445
Speaker 6:  listens to the full soundscape separately and picks out just the specific

144
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,885
Speaker 6:  sounds that it's listening for. In this case, a door knock.

145
00:09:41,385 --> 00:09:45,045
Speaker 9:  We have a program that runs on the orange pie, which

146
00:09:45,165 --> 00:09:49,125
Speaker 9:  continuously just records audio that in chunks of eight millisecond. Then

147
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:52,645
Speaker 9:  it passes this to a neural network where

148
00:09:52,835 --> 00:09:56,725
Speaker 9:  it's processed with the condition that this

149
00:09:56,725 --> 00:10:00,605
Speaker 9:  neural network tries to extract some target class. This target

150
00:10:00,615 --> 00:10:01,965
Speaker 9:  class is what you select here.

151
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:06,285
Speaker 6:  Okay. But yeah, we've got cat cricket, dog knock and rooster. Yeah.

152
00:10:06,285 --> 00:10:08,885
Speaker 6:  Those are the, those are the classes that you have queued up right now? Exactly.

153
00:10:09,385 --> 00:10:11,045
Speaker 2:  All the most common noises in the world.

154
00:10:11,325 --> 00:10:14,485
Speaker 6:  Right. Of course. Anything that you would wanna be selecting and deselecting,

155
00:10:14,485 --> 00:10:18,245
Speaker 6:  there's a smartphone screen that I have access to and there are buttons for

156
00:10:18,245 --> 00:10:22,165
Speaker 6:  each one of those categories. And in each one of those cases, Molik

157
00:10:22,165 --> 00:10:25,565
Speaker 6:  has fed a neural network, a whole bunch of those clips, different

158
00:10:25,985 --> 00:10:29,565
Speaker 6:  dog sounds and door knock sounds and everything else to train it to recognize

159
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:33,525
Speaker 6:  that specific sound. I actually asked Molik to share some of

160
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:36,805
Speaker 6:  the sounds that he used outta curiosity. I don't know what I was expecting

161
00:10:36,805 --> 00:10:39,685
Speaker 6:  to learn from that, but here are the cat sounds that he used.

162
00:10:40,585 --> 00:10:40,805
Speaker 10:  Oh,

163
00:10:43,795 --> 00:10:45,085
Speaker 2:  Very familiar with those.

164
00:10:45,685 --> 00:10:49,485
Speaker 6:  I, I had to ask him because I just pictured him sifting through and he did

165
00:10:49,485 --> 00:10:53,005
Speaker 6:  this, he just sifted through hundreds and hundreds of sourced

166
00:10:53,345 --> 00:10:57,045
Speaker 6:  cat sounds and cleaned them up and fed them into the system. So the AI is

167
00:10:57,045 --> 00:11:00,965
Speaker 6:  trained on these categories now so that when I hit the cat button,

168
00:11:01,385 --> 00:11:05,085
Speaker 6:  the system will mute every sound in the world except for cat meows.

169
00:11:05,425 --> 00:11:09,325
Speaker 6:  So going back to the demo, I did that, I hit the cat button, Molik

170
00:11:09,325 --> 00:11:13,165
Speaker 6:  turned the vacuum cleaner back on and he queued up a looping sound of

171
00:11:13,165 --> 00:11:14,245
Speaker 6:  that really annoying cat.

172
00:11:14,515 --> 00:11:18,085
Speaker 9:  Yeah. Pretend like it's a regular day, lazy Sunday, you want to play with

173
00:11:18,085 --> 00:11:21,445
Speaker 9:  your cat. Right. But there's a noisy vacuum cleaner in the background.

174
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:25,205
Speaker 6:  I hate it when I'm vacuuming and playing with my cat at the same time.

175
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:31,205
Speaker 6:  Okay. Transparency mode. My poor cat is trying to get my attention,

176
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:35,365
Speaker 6:  but I can't hear him so I'm gonna flip to cat mode.

177
00:11:39,105 --> 00:11:39,325
Speaker 2:  Wow,

178
00:11:41,145 --> 00:11:42,605
Speaker 2:  that's really impressive.

179
00:11:43,115 --> 00:11:46,965
Speaker 6:  It's super impressive. The, the sound is a little odd. Like you, to me,

180
00:11:46,965 --> 00:11:50,845
Speaker 6:  it sounds like the cat is meowing in a submarine, but it's super clear

181
00:11:50,845 --> 00:11:54,525
Speaker 6:  and the vacuum cleaner is totally gone. And for the record, what you're hearing

182
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:58,165
Speaker 6:  right now is actually a little bit better than what it sounds like in reality

183
00:11:58,165 --> 00:12:01,965
Speaker 6:  because in the room I'm wearing headphones and some of that vacuum cleaner

184
00:12:01,965 --> 00:12:03,845
Speaker 6:  sound is making it through the headphones.

185
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:07,365
Speaker 5:  And this is what the headphones are outputting to your ears.

186
00:12:07,715 --> 00:12:08,205
Speaker 6:  Exactly.

187
00:12:08,755 --> 00:12:12,605
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Will, you mentioned this is not for actual cats

188
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:16,285
Speaker 2:  and vacuum cleaners. What is your sense of what this is actually for? Like

189
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:19,285
Speaker 2:  what, what are the folks working on this thinking they might be able to do

190
00:12:19,285 --> 00:12:19,525
Speaker 2:  with it?

191
00:12:19,795 --> 00:12:23,725
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I mean the most obvious example that comes up over and over again is,

192
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:27,085
Speaker 6:  is you're walking down the street and you want to be able to hear

193
00:12:27,765 --> 00:12:31,445
Speaker 6:  a car honking at you because that is a, a thing that you, that is, that's

194
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:34,965
Speaker 6:  a safety thing. Sure. But you don't want to hear all the other annoying sounds.

195
00:12:35,385 --> 00:12:39,245
Speaker 6:  Or the folks I talked to brought up industrial settings where it's really

196
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:43,245
Speaker 6:  loud and workers are wearing earplugs for safety, but they want to be able

197
00:12:43,245 --> 00:12:47,165
Speaker 6:  to talk to each other or hear sounds over the intercom or whatever

198
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:50,925
Speaker 6:  else. So those are the really obvious use cases. And from playing with

199
00:12:51,075 --> 00:12:55,045
Speaker 6:  this really early demo, it felt like even this early demo could

200
00:12:55,045 --> 00:12:57,485
Speaker 6:  do that much, which is super impressive.

201
00:12:57,905 --> 00:13:01,565
Speaker 5:  So you mentioned also like crickets and dogs and other things.

202
00:13:01,755 --> 00:13:04,805
Speaker 5:  What are some other demos that you were able to test out there? Yeah,

203
00:13:04,805 --> 00:13:08,685
Speaker 6:  So in theory you can train the AI

204
00:13:08,905 --> 00:13:12,645
Speaker 6:  on any sound and we played through a few different

205
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:16,565
Speaker 6:  options that they had queued up. None of it was perfect. Like

206
00:13:16,565 --> 00:13:20,525
Speaker 6:  there were these times where it was supposed to be muting

207
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:24,365
Speaker 6:  all voices. But my voice kind of clipped into the final mix that you can

208
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:26,045
Speaker 6:  hear. I can, we can play that.

209
00:13:26,635 --> 00:13:28,725
Speaker 11:  Okay. Don't understand.

210
00:13:30,425 --> 00:13:31,405
Speaker 5:  Oh yeah, that's funky.

211
00:13:31,675 --> 00:13:35,605
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So you know, rough around the edges. We went back to the barnyard and

212
00:13:35,845 --> 00:13:39,525
Speaker 6:  listened to all of those other different sound clips in a lot of

213
00:13:39,525 --> 00:13:43,205
Speaker 6:  different iterations just to see how good it was at toggling between

214
00:13:43,205 --> 00:13:43,965
Speaker 6:  different sounds.

215
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,685
Speaker 9:  Now that we've done cat and vacuum cleaner. Yes. We'll move on to some other

216
00:13:47,685 --> 00:13:49,205
Speaker 9:  classes. Let's do cat and cricket.

217
00:13:50,065 --> 00:13:52,765
Speaker 12:  All right. Here's transparency mode.

218
00:13:55,005 --> 00:13:58,565
Speaker 12:  A cat and a cricket are both trying really hard to get my attention.

219
00:13:59,225 --> 00:14:00,285
Speaker 12:  That's enough. I cat

220
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:07,445
Speaker 5:  In this demo. You couldn't hear the cat at all. You just heard the crickets.

221
00:14:07,785 --> 00:14:11,725
Speaker 6:  No, it was gone. Yeah. The big takeaway for me was that this system is

222
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:15,485
Speaker 6:  already really good at full isolation. It just

223
00:14:15,485 --> 00:14:19,005
Speaker 6:  needs to make the sounds that you are hearing sound more natural.

224
00:14:19,355 --> 00:14:23,245
Speaker 6:  Like that's just to my ear, that's where the work was. It was already

225
00:14:23,255 --> 00:14:26,845
Speaker 6:  doing an unbelievable job at canceling out the stuff you didn't want.

226
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:31,365
Speaker 2:  I'm desperate to know what the like last demo he gave you was.

227
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:34,805
Speaker 2:  'cause I gotta assume he's like ramping up in difficulty here, but there's

228
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:38,125
Speaker 2:  definitely a point at which he knows this thing will fall apart. Like what?

229
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,645
Speaker 2:  What was the most intense demo he gave you?

230
00:14:41,145 --> 00:14:44,805
Speaker 6:  Oh, we did a big finish, which was dog and a rooster and a cat.

231
00:14:48,715 --> 00:14:51,085
Speaker 12:  This is the most annoying farm in the world. Okay.

232
00:14:51,675 --> 00:14:52,925
Speaker 6:  Alright. Just rooster.

233
00:15:00,475 --> 00:15:04,365
Speaker 6:  It's interesting those two and I can see how subjective this would all

234
00:15:04,365 --> 00:15:07,645
Speaker 6:  be. It feels like those sounds are bleeding into each other a little bit

235
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:11,285
Speaker 6:  more. I wonder if they're just a little more similar than

236
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,005
Speaker 6:  the others

237
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:15,125
Speaker 9:  Or Yeah. Yeah, I think it could be that some sounds are similar. Yeah.

238
00:15:16,025 --> 00:15:17,565
Speaker 9:  And finally we'll do dog and cat.

239
00:15:21,675 --> 00:15:25,285
Speaker 12:  This is very triggering. This is why I don't like working from home. Okay,

240
00:15:26,735 --> 00:15:27,525
Speaker 12:  sorry cat.

241
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,685
Speaker 12:  Okay. And now I'll just pay attention to the cat.

242
00:15:36,595 --> 00:15:39,765
Speaker 2:  Okay. This is really impressive but I'm, I'm stuck on two things.

243
00:15:40,385 --> 00:15:44,365
Speaker 2:  One is, is the idea that you will carry around

244
00:15:44,605 --> 00:15:48,565
Speaker 2:  a smartphone constantly selecting the noises that you want to see. Like

245
00:15:48,705 --> 00:15:51,685
Speaker 2:  should I walk around saying, oh it looks like that cat's trying to get my

246
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:55,245
Speaker 2:  attention, let me let the cat in. Or is The future some sort of

247
00:15:55,475 --> 00:15:59,205
Speaker 2:  beautifully adaptive thing that understands as you're going, did you get

248
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:01,965
Speaker 2:  a sense from them kind of how they see this eventually working?

249
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:06,445
Speaker 6:  Yes, and I talked to the head of this lab all about that, but before we did

250
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:09,685
Speaker 6:  that we talked about how they're gonna get to that point.

251
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:13,405
Speaker 2:  That was my other question is how do you take this from a pair of Bose headphones

252
00:16:13,915 --> 00:16:17,805
Speaker 2:  with a bunch of junk taped on it to an actual thing that humans can

253
00:16:17,805 --> 00:16:17,965
Speaker 2:  buy.

254
00:16:18,265 --> 00:16:21,605
Speaker 6:  So yeah, let's talk about their, their full roadmap from where they're now

255
00:16:21,905 --> 00:16:25,685
Speaker 6:  to what you're describing. The first step in that process is

256
00:16:25,995 --> 00:16:29,605
Speaker 6:  just getting better at doing all of these tasks. And that means

257
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,045
Speaker 6:  feeding their model a whole lot more data,

258
00:16:32,515 --> 00:16:33,445
Speaker 2:  More cricket sounds,

259
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:37,645
Speaker 6:  So many more cricket sounds and grasshopper sounds and cicada sounds. And

260
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:41,485
Speaker 6:  just basically train it to recognize a million more categories of sounds

261
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:45,325
Speaker 6:  and to recognize all those individual sounds just a lot more accurately.

262
00:16:45,665 --> 00:16:49,365
Speaker 6:  And if they can do that and do that super well, then

263
00:16:49,745 --> 00:16:52,165
Speaker 6:  the possible use cases just explode.

264
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:56,725
Speaker 9:  You could totally see this being applied to different tasks. Like

265
00:16:56,825 --> 00:17:00,605
Speaker 9:  say I want to not just listen to sounds but

266
00:17:00,965 --> 00:17:04,445
Speaker 9:  specific people. Like I want to listen to you in a conversation. So, I can

267
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:08,445
Speaker 9:  maybe have some representation of how you sound like and then I can,

268
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:12,245
Speaker 9:  you know, just pick up your sound as we, as we speak, as we have a conversation,

269
00:17:12,275 --> 00:17:14,485
Speaker 9:  even if there's lots of other people around us.

270
00:17:15,305 --> 00:17:19,005
Speaker 5:  So all the current headphones right now, they do it really

271
00:17:19,165 --> 00:17:22,965
Speaker 5:  well because they can predict when these sounds are coming. So when

272
00:17:22,965 --> 00:17:26,525
Speaker 5:  you're in the airplane, you know these sounds are gonna be 10 seconds from

273
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:30,045
Speaker 5:  now and 10 seconds before. But a bird sound, a cat

274
00:17:30,155 --> 00:17:33,925
Speaker 5:  meowing, crickets chirping, you don't know when those are coming. So how

275
00:17:33,925 --> 00:17:37,845
Speaker 5:  would they be able to predict they would have to move pretty fast on

276
00:17:38,085 --> 00:17:38,525
Speaker 5:  the device.

277
00:17:39,115 --> 00:17:43,085
Speaker 6:  Exactly. That's the problem of what they call transient sounds.

278
00:17:43,505 --> 00:17:47,125
Speaker 6:  And that's a big hurdle for existing ANC

279
00:17:47,335 --> 00:17:50,925
Speaker 6:  technology. This system is really good at it, but it

280
00:17:51,295 --> 00:17:55,165
Speaker 6:  needs to process the incoming audio super, super

281
00:17:55,195 --> 00:17:59,045
Speaker 6:  fast. There's no time to send it to the cloud for processing. There

282
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:02,645
Speaker 6:  isn't really even time to send the incoming audio like to your

283
00:18:02,645 --> 00:18:06,525
Speaker 6:  phone's processor over Bluetooth. You, you would just end up with a

284
00:18:06,665 --> 00:18:10,285
Speaker 6:  lag between what you're hearing and what your eyes are actually seeing, which

285
00:18:10,285 --> 00:18:14,245
Speaker 6:  is just a complete non-starter. So all of the work that we're talking about

286
00:18:14,255 --> 00:18:17,645
Speaker 6:  doing has to happen onboard the headphones themselves.

287
00:18:18,385 --> 00:18:22,045
Speaker 9:  If we can get this model to be much, much more efficient through lots of

288
00:18:22,075 --> 00:18:25,845
Speaker 9:  just standard machine learning techniques, then we can fit like a more

289
00:18:25,845 --> 00:18:29,805
Speaker 9:  capable model into this, this small device. Another way to, to

290
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:32,965
Speaker 9:  also help on the hardware side is, you know, in the

291
00:18:33,825 --> 00:18:37,725
Speaker 9:  recent few years there's been lots and lots of companies that

292
00:18:37,725 --> 00:18:41,645
Speaker 9:  work on designing AI chips that can do, you know, a large,

293
00:18:41,645 --> 00:18:44,925
Speaker 9:  large amount of computation with very low power consumption

294
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:47,245
Speaker 9:  and those things are very promising.

295
00:18:47,985 --> 00:18:51,965
Speaker 2:  So you've just made me imagine what amounts to like a pair of headphones

296
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:55,925
Speaker 2:  with A GPU attached, which I think is like literally

297
00:18:55,925 --> 00:18:59,805
Speaker 2:  what he's describing and that both seems cool and like maybe we're all, this

298
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,765
Speaker 2:  is going but also very expensive, very big and

299
00:19:03,815 --> 00:19:07,765
Speaker 2:  maybe very far away. What is the sense of how we

300
00:19:07,765 --> 00:19:11,685
Speaker 2:  get from literally strapping like an Nvidia GPU to my

301
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:15,605
Speaker 2:  face to the thing he's describing, which I think ultimately it

302
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:17,885
Speaker 2:  has to look like a pair of bows headphones, right? Like we're not gonna take

303
00:19:18,085 --> 00:19:19,965
Speaker 2:  anything that doesn't look like a pair of bows headphones.

304
00:19:20,395 --> 00:19:24,165
Speaker 6:  This is where we'll have to see they're talking about a, a hearing

305
00:19:24,345 --> 00:19:27,965
Speaker 6:  aid sized form factor. Oh wow. They want to go much, much

306
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:31,685
Speaker 6:  smaller and they think that they can do it with these

307
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:35,445
Speaker 6:  purpose-built lightweight chips that are really good at running

308
00:19:36,065 --> 00:19:39,805
Speaker 6:  AI systems. So they're playing with all of the chips that are very

309
00:19:40,065 --> 00:19:44,005
Speaker 6:  new and newly available and they're sort of doing all of these

310
00:19:44,005 --> 00:19:47,205
Speaker 6:  different things at the same time. They're doing the software optimization,

311
00:19:47,355 --> 00:19:51,285
Speaker 6:  they're feeding the model, all this more data and they're

312
00:19:51,285 --> 00:19:54,765
Speaker 6:  working on the hardware too to shrink it as quickly as possible. And they

313
00:19:54,765 --> 00:19:57,605
Speaker 6:  think they have the raw materials to do that pretty soon. So we

314
00:19:57,605 --> 00:20:01,485
Speaker 2:  Have like an academic lab masquerading as like a full stack electronics

315
00:20:01,485 --> 00:20:01,925
Speaker 2:  company here.

316
00:20:01,995 --> 00:20:05,565
Speaker 6:  Yeah, absolutely. That's the, that's the fun thing about this lab in particular

317
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:06,965
Speaker 6:  is they're, that's very holistic.

318
00:20:07,505 --> 00:20:11,405
Speaker 5:  Oh, what about the user interface? Am I gonna be like asking Siri

319
00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:14,365
Speaker 5:  every 10 seconds? Like, did you hear my cat? Is my cat meowing?

320
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:18,725
Speaker 6:  So they're thinking a lot about this because

321
00:20:19,555 --> 00:20:23,045
Speaker 6:  even when I was playing with this demo, I was like, oh god, five button,

322
00:20:23,075 --> 00:20:26,845
Speaker 6:  this is just five buttons in the real world you would need 5 million

323
00:20:26,955 --> 00:20:30,845
Speaker 6:  buttons to actually dial in the soundscape that you want. So obviously

324
00:20:30,845 --> 00:20:34,805
Speaker 6:  you need some sort of automation here. And the lab is

325
00:20:34,805 --> 00:20:38,645
Speaker 6:  looking at different AI assisted ways to do this. So this whole

326
00:20:38,645 --> 00:20:42,485
Speaker 6:  thing is gonna be AI onis, but I talked to the head of the

327
00:20:42,485 --> 00:20:45,725
Speaker 6:  mobile intelligence lab shiam go Lakota about exactly this.

328
00:20:46,215 --> 00:20:49,655
Speaker 13:  We're gonna have some systems in the next few months to a year

329
00:20:50,155 --> 00:20:54,135
Speaker 13:  on trying to go away slowly from like actually having the user to like

330
00:20:54,205 --> 00:20:57,495
Speaker 13:  pick different kinds of sounds to less and less

331
00:20:57,605 --> 00:21:01,575
Speaker 13:  involvement of the user itself. You can imagine a system where the AI automatically

332
00:21:01,575 --> 00:21:04,335
Speaker 13:  learns what you want to listen to. And I think that's something which we

333
00:21:04,335 --> 00:21:07,535
Speaker 13:  are building towards. And I think by the end of the year, hopefully we can

334
00:21:07,695 --> 00:21:10,735
Speaker 13:  actually have a system where AI would automatically learn what you want

335
00:21:10,735 --> 00:21:11,135
Speaker 13:  to listen to.

336
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,535
Speaker 2:  That is ambitious. Yeah,

337
00:21:13,845 --> 00:21:17,575
Speaker 6:  Yeah. They're, they're juggling a lot of balls at the same time here. And

338
00:21:17,595 --> 00:21:21,375
Speaker 6:  the, you know, the end goal that Shiam is envisioning is a system that

339
00:21:21,515 --> 00:21:25,335
Speaker 6:  is using data from say your smartphone to think and

340
00:21:25,335 --> 00:21:28,455
Speaker 6:  learn about where you are, what you're doing,

341
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:33,135
Speaker 6:  and start to make those decisions kind of with as much or

342
00:21:33,135 --> 00:21:36,775
Speaker 6:  as little input as you want, as to what you're hearing and and what you're

343
00:21:36,775 --> 00:21:40,575
Speaker 6:  not. So say, you know, again, you're living in a busy city with lots of

344
00:21:40,575 --> 00:21:42,895
Speaker 6:  loud traffic, but you're inside your house.

345
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:46,855
Speaker 13:  So that's exactly the thing. Like clearly an AI can tell

346
00:21:46,855 --> 00:21:50,535
Speaker 13:  depending on my motion and my IMU, whether I'm moving as much,

347
00:21:50,585 --> 00:21:54,335
Speaker 13:  where am I? It knows my GGPS location so it knows that I'm in a house.

348
00:21:54,725 --> 00:21:57,855
Speaker 13:  Does it really need me to listen to like the, the sounds of the

349
00:21:58,385 --> 00:22:02,375
Speaker 13:  honks? Not really, but if I'm on a street, maybe it can

350
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:06,295
Speaker 13:  because I'm walking on a street or I'm in, I'm in a car, it should potentially

351
00:22:06,355 --> 00:22:09,015
Speaker 13:  be like, you need to hear these honks. Although

352
00:22:09,015 --> 00:22:12,775
Speaker 6:  Then I, the next place my brain goes is how to make sure

353
00:22:12,775 --> 00:22:16,015
Speaker 6:  that it's doing that safely and reliably. Because there's one thing we've

354
00:22:16,015 --> 00:22:19,895
Speaker 6:  watched from Tesla autopilot to, you know, chat

355
00:22:20,135 --> 00:22:24,015
Speaker 6:  GPT hallucinating to whatever else. It's like there's an asterisk

356
00:22:24,075 --> 00:22:27,775
Speaker 6:  on so, so many of these tasks that we just sort of let

357
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:31,495
Speaker 6:  the AI take care of and it strikes me that trusting

358
00:22:31,645 --> 00:22:35,335
Speaker 6:  your headphones to decide when you need to hear a car horn or not

359
00:22:35,665 --> 00:22:37,055
Speaker 6:  could be a high stakes thing.

360
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:40,655
Speaker 13:  High stake situation. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think that's definitely something

361
00:22:40,975 --> 00:22:44,255
Speaker 13:  which has to be integrated in these systems. And it could be that certain

362
00:22:44,255 --> 00:22:47,695
Speaker 13:  things, like if I'm actually in the house, that's when you remove all these

363
00:22:47,695 --> 00:22:51,255
Speaker 13:  ambient sounds but it's just like hard coded saying that you cannot remove

364
00:22:51,255 --> 00:22:54,455
Speaker 13:  certain things in outdoor environments where you know that it's important.

365
00:22:54,515 --> 00:22:57,815
Speaker 13:  But that's an extremely important point, which is like when we deploy these

366
00:22:57,815 --> 00:23:01,455
Speaker 13:  things at scale and have this thing automatically learn, you got to have

367
00:23:01,455 --> 00:23:04,655
Speaker 13:  certain rules which prioritize safety over functionality. I think

368
00:23:05,355 --> 00:23:09,095
Speaker 2:  The thing that's being described here is so beautiful and

369
00:23:09,105 --> 00:23:13,095
Speaker 2:  smart and so non-existent in the real world that it's like, it's like

370
00:23:13,095 --> 00:23:16,575
Speaker 2:  what we talk about with self-driving, right? Like if people weren't weird

371
00:23:16,675 --> 00:23:20,215
Speaker 2:  and didn't make strange decisions and pedestrians and bicycles didn't exist,

372
00:23:20,215 --> 00:23:24,095
Speaker 2:  self-driving cars would be awesome. So easy, so great. But the world

373
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:26,815
Speaker 2:  is a weird messy place full of edge cases.

374
00:23:27,245 --> 00:23:31,215
Speaker 6:  Yeah. And that's where we just haven't seen that whole half of

375
00:23:31,215 --> 00:23:34,855
Speaker 6:  this prototype. They have proven out that they can make crickets go away.

376
00:23:35,025 --> 00:23:35,375
Speaker 6:  Which

377
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,015
Speaker 2:  Is impressive.

378
00:23:36,025 --> 00:23:39,455
Speaker 6:  Which is impressive. Yeah. And it's like you can see a roadmap to extracting

379
00:23:39,895 --> 00:23:43,855
Speaker 6:  a million other sounds based on that. And then this bigger end

380
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:47,645
Speaker 6:  state of dialing in exactly what you want is the

381
00:23:47,645 --> 00:23:51,325
Speaker 6:  loftier thing and there's, there's a lot of work to be done there.

382
00:23:51,705 --> 00:23:55,565
Speaker 6:  But if they can figure out even some of this stuff you could

383
00:23:55,565 --> 00:23:59,285
Speaker 6:  imagine, you know, them getting to a really interesting product.

384
00:24:00,055 --> 00:24:03,805
Speaker 6:  Shiam is interested in smart hearing aids,

385
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:07,685
Speaker 6:  you can see how anyone with a hearing aid could use even

386
00:24:08,205 --> 00:24:12,085
Speaker 6:  a portion of this technology. Anyone with a sound sensitivity?

387
00:24:12,525 --> 00:24:16,485
Speaker 6:  I use noise cancellation just to turn the world down to keep my anxiety

388
00:24:16,485 --> 00:24:20,445
Speaker 6:  in check. So, I would love to be able to dial in

389
00:24:20,475 --> 00:24:24,445
Speaker 6:  that sound a little bit more. Shiam made the argument too that

390
00:24:24,805 --> 00:24:28,685
Speaker 6:  a lot of us just live in a very noisy world and noise just

391
00:24:28,825 --> 00:24:32,565
Speaker 6:  as a thing that we're all confronted with is bad for everybody

392
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:36,525
Speaker 13:  And it actually does impact your health. There are studies we say that noise

393
00:24:36,525 --> 00:24:40,325
Speaker 13:  pollution affects your sleep and that ends up affecting

394
00:24:40,595 --> 00:24:44,525
Speaker 13:  your lifespan. So I do think that having this kind

395
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:48,325
Speaker 13:  of a capability where people can control their environment is just not a

396
00:24:48,465 --> 00:24:52,085
Speaker 13:  toy. I think it actually can have a meaningful impact on the quality of

397
00:24:52,085 --> 00:24:55,605
Speaker 13:  life and sleep and a lot of things which I think are

398
00:24:55,755 --> 00:24:59,445
Speaker 13:  extremely important for humans to thrive and not just survive

399
00:25:00,145 --> 00:25:03,925
Speaker 6:  So, I mean wherever this specific prototype lands we are,

400
00:25:03,975 --> 00:25:07,365
Speaker 6:  we're definitely leaving the fancy earplugs era of noise

401
00:25:07,365 --> 00:25:10,765
Speaker 6:  cancellation and entering an era that is much more

402
00:25:11,445 --> 00:25:14,765
Speaker 6:  specific and bespoke and a little bit smarter what that looks like

403
00:25:15,445 --> 00:25:18,485
Speaker 6:  TBD. But I am very excited about that concept.

404
00:25:19,445 --> 00:25:22,645
Speaker 2:  I am too. And I, I wonder Andru, just to come all the way back around to

405
00:25:22,645 --> 00:25:25,765
Speaker 2:  this idea of what we were talking about at the very beginning with what active

406
00:25:25,765 --> 00:25:29,685
Speaker 2:  noise cancellation does, it seems like knowing this kind of stuff

407
00:25:29,685 --> 00:25:32,765
Speaker 2:  where you can say like not only is this an external sound and I wanna get

408
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:36,725
Speaker 2:  rid of it, but I know specifically which external sound it is. I

409
00:25:36,725 --> 00:25:40,525
Speaker 2:  think even leaving aside sort of that big giant grand vision, it just feels

410
00:25:40,525 --> 00:25:43,165
Speaker 2:  like that step alone does a lot.

411
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:47,445
Speaker 5:  Oh totally. I mean to be able to walk into a store

412
00:25:47,585 --> 00:25:51,405
Speaker 5:  and the headphones know I am in a store and I'm gonna be

413
00:25:51,405 --> 00:25:55,245
Speaker 5:  talking to someone checking out, or I have

414
00:25:55,565 --> 00:25:59,485
Speaker 5:  a library of sounds that are unique to my experience that I

415
00:25:59,485 --> 00:26:03,405
Speaker 5:  would like to tune out and the sounds are only at this specific coffee

416
00:26:03,555 --> 00:26:07,245
Speaker 5:  shop that I go to study that's super compelling to me.

417
00:26:07,785 --> 00:26:11,445
Speaker 5:  Do I want my headphones to know where I am at all times? I'm not sure.

418
00:26:11,925 --> 00:26:15,685
Speaker 5:  Right. But there's a lot of awesome possibilities of

419
00:26:15,955 --> 00:26:19,805
Speaker 5:  just tuning things out and tuning things in wherever

420
00:26:19,805 --> 00:26:20,125
Speaker 5:  you are.

421
00:26:20,435 --> 00:26:24,245
Speaker 2:  Yeah, I I think the self-driving example just keeps feeling more and

422
00:26:24,245 --> 00:26:27,565
Speaker 2:  more true to me as we talk about this that the first thing where it's like,

423
00:26:27,565 --> 00:26:31,125
Speaker 2:  okay, my car can park itself and will

424
00:26:31,555 --> 00:26:34,645
Speaker 2:  stay in its lane if I try to drift out of it because I'm not paying attention.

425
00:26:34,695 --> 00:26:38,645
Speaker 2:  Right. Doable, awesome. If you extend that all the way out to all the

426
00:26:38,645 --> 00:26:41,125
Speaker 2:  cars on the road will drive themselves and robot taxis will be everywhere.

427
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:44,045
Speaker 2:  Like you've sort of lost me. I it maybe it'll happen someday in The future,

428
00:26:44,305 --> 00:26:48,245
Speaker 2:  but that doesn't make the first thing any less cool. And I feel like there's

429
00:26:48,245 --> 00:26:51,805
Speaker 2:  a lot of that in here too, where it's like even just boil it all the way

430
00:26:51,805 --> 00:26:55,685
Speaker 2:  down, this is gonna make noise cancellation better because the cats get through

431
00:26:55,685 --> 00:26:59,445
Speaker 2:  my headphones now and they can stop getting through my headphones once we

432
00:26:59,445 --> 00:26:59,925
Speaker 2:  get this tech.

433
00:27:00,315 --> 00:27:03,805
Speaker 6:  Totally. And I think that no matter how far

434
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:08,045
Speaker 6:  into that idealized end state they get, they're very confident

435
00:27:08,045 --> 00:27:11,965
Speaker 6:  that they can get a lot farther, very quickly. They have access to

436
00:27:12,135 --> 00:27:16,085
Speaker 6:  these chips, the, the software is improving very quickly. So they

437
00:27:16,085 --> 00:27:19,565
Speaker 6:  have a lot of ambitions for this year. They think they can get to a much,

438
00:27:19,565 --> 00:27:23,005
Speaker 6:  much smaller form factor by the end of this year for example. And they have

439
00:27:23,045 --> 00:27:26,365
Speaker 6:  a lot more very specific ideas for

440
00:27:26,915 --> 00:27:30,845
Speaker 6:  that sort of filtration step. So yeah, it's,

441
00:27:30,845 --> 00:27:34,605
Speaker 6:  you know, for me that very, very limited demo was impressive

442
00:27:34,605 --> 00:27:38,365
Speaker 6:  enough and they had enough plans for this year that I'm going

443
00:27:38,905 --> 00:27:42,805
Speaker 6:  be following that lab and see what they come up with next. 'cause I,

444
00:27:42,845 --> 00:27:44,365
Speaker 6:  I think it's gonna be an interesting year for it.

445
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:47,405
Speaker 2:  Do you think at the end of this they're gonna try to sell me headphones?

446
00:27:47,405 --> 00:27:51,165
Speaker 2:  Like what's their game plan here? Are they gonna spin out a company and try

447
00:27:51,165 --> 00:27:53,805
Speaker 2:  to be a headphone player? Are they gonna try and work with some of the folks

448
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:56,445
Speaker 2:  out there? Did you get any sense of how they wanna get this out in the world?

449
00:27:57,115 --> 00:28:00,445
Speaker 6:  They seemed open to that. you know, they're an academic department, they're

450
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:03,925
Speaker 6:  talking about commercialization, you know, they're like a lot of

451
00:28:04,245 --> 00:28:07,685
Speaker 6:  academics, they're walking this fine line between, you know, just moving

452
00:28:08,075 --> 00:28:12,005
Speaker 6:  this technology forward and experimenting with it but also like knowing that

453
00:28:12,005 --> 00:28:15,325
Speaker 6:  they've got something and they feel like they are potentially

454
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:19,645
Speaker 6:  ahead of a lot of big tech companies on this. So they

455
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:23,565
Speaker 6:  are thinking in those terms and I think that's one of the

456
00:28:23,565 --> 00:28:25,325
Speaker 6:  reasons they're trying to work as quickly as they are.

457
00:28:25,595 --> 00:28:28,525
Speaker 2:  Yeah, it does seem like this is happening fast. I feel like a Andru, you

458
00:28:28,525 --> 00:28:31,765
Speaker 2:  were the one running around New York with the head on the subway

459
00:28:32,405 --> 00:28:36,165
Speaker 2:  a year ago. This strikes me as something that a lot of those companies

460
00:28:36,725 --> 00:28:40,525
Speaker 2:  building ANC headphones are probably also thinking about.

461
00:28:40,525 --> 00:28:44,485
Speaker 2:  Like, do you think this is the next turn for a lot of those companies

462
00:28:44,505 --> 00:28:47,125
Speaker 2:  and is this gonna be the next thing that makes these headphones better for

463
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:47,325
Speaker 2:  people?

464
00:28:47,805 --> 00:28:51,245
Speaker 5:  I think so, and I know Bose is thinking about it a lot as the next

465
00:28:51,245 --> 00:28:55,165
Speaker 5:  generation of noise cancellation. Apple is already trying to do

466
00:28:55,165 --> 00:28:58,885
Speaker 5:  the adaptive things as we mentioned, but right now it's just

467
00:28:58,885 --> 00:29:02,725
Speaker 5:  boosting things instead of taking things out. So if

468
00:29:02,725 --> 00:29:06,365
Speaker 5:  there's a world where they can remove the, the dogs out of

469
00:29:06,425 --> 00:29:10,205
Speaker 5:  Will's room while he's recording a podcast, I mean there's like

470
00:29:10,205 --> 00:29:11,645
Speaker 5:  endless possibilities of there

471
00:29:11,645 --> 00:29:15,245
Speaker 6:  Was a dog button on that prototype. We just need that prototype and we'll

472
00:29:15,245 --> 00:29:15,525
Speaker 6:  be fine.

473
00:29:15,915 --> 00:29:18,845
Speaker 2:  Well by this time next year, The Vergecast will be a listenable podcast.

474
00:29:19,075 --> 00:29:19,725
Speaker 2:  It's gonna be great.

475
00:29:20,815 --> 00:29:21,805
Speaker 6:  Thank you. And sorry.

476
00:32:46,345 --> 00:32:50,205
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. If. you remember the smartphone world before the iPhone?

477
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:54,245
Speaker 2:  It was much wackier than it is today. Back then, there were lots of

478
00:32:54,245 --> 00:32:57,885
Speaker 2:  ideas about how a smartphone should look and work. Some of them

479
00:32:57,955 --> 00:33:01,925
Speaker 2:  twisted open, some of them slid open, some of them flipped open and a

480
00:33:01,925 --> 00:33:05,765
Speaker 2:  lot of them had physical keyboards. And then the iPhone all at

481
00:33:05,765 --> 00:33:09,645
Speaker 2:  once kind of upended that. Here's Steve Jobs at the original iPhone

482
00:33:09,645 --> 00:33:13,485
Speaker 2:  launch in 2007 explaining what he saw as the problem with

483
00:33:13,685 --> 00:33:14,205
Speaker 2:  hardware keyboards.

484
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:18,285
Speaker 15:  Here's four smartphones, right? The Motorola queue, the BlackBerry

485
00:33:18,835 --> 00:33:22,765
Speaker 15:  pore, Nokia E 62. The usual suspects. What's wrong with

486
00:33:22,765 --> 00:33:26,685
Speaker 15:  their user interfaces? Well, the problem with them is really sort of

487
00:33:26,685 --> 00:33:30,525
Speaker 15:  in the bottom 40 there. It's, it's this stuff right here. They all

488
00:33:30,525 --> 00:33:34,165
Speaker 15:  have these keyboards that are there whether you need them or not to be there.

489
00:33:34,865 --> 00:33:38,685
Speaker 15:  And they all have these control buttons that are fixed in plastic

490
00:33:39,185 --> 00:33:42,685
Speaker 15:  and are the same for every application. Well, every application wants a

491
00:33:42,845 --> 00:33:46,725
Speaker 15:  slightly different user interface, a slightly optimized set of buttons

492
00:33:46,915 --> 00:33:50,085
Speaker 15:  just for it. And what happens, If, you think of a great idea six months

493
00:33:50,085 --> 00:33:53,205
Speaker 15:  from now, you can't run around and add a button to these things. They're

494
00:33:53,205 --> 00:33:53,605
Speaker 15:  already shipped.

495
00:33:54,555 --> 00:33:58,525
Speaker 2:  It's a good take. Right? And history proved him pretty much correct,

496
00:33:58,775 --> 00:34:02,165
Speaker 2:  which is why virtually every phone on the planet now has a virtual

497
00:34:02,485 --> 00:34:05,965
Speaker 2:  onscreen keyboard instead of a big physical one. Underneath

498
00:34:06,435 --> 00:34:10,165
Speaker 2:  Jobs did definitely have it right, but not all right? Because there

499
00:34:10,265 --> 00:34:14,245
Speaker 2:  are things I think a lot of people miss about physical keyboards. You

500
00:34:14,245 --> 00:34:17,685
Speaker 2:  can type faster on physical keyboards. That's just true. There's plenty of

501
00:34:17,845 --> 00:34:21,405
Speaker 2:  evidence for that. You can type without looking at your phone so much you

502
00:34:21,405 --> 00:34:25,285
Speaker 2:  can type without the keyboard taking up like 40% of the screen. And

503
00:34:25,285 --> 00:34:29,165
Speaker 2:  so over the years, various people have tried to bring back the keyboard

504
00:34:29,345 --> 00:34:33,125
Speaker 2:  to the smartphone. Remember way back when Ryan Seacrest was out there

505
00:34:33,285 --> 00:34:36,565
Speaker 2:  hawking a case called Typo that put a keyboard back underneath your iPhone.

506
00:34:36,795 --> 00:34:39,165
Speaker 2:  This is how we explained it in an interview with TechCrunch.

507
00:34:39,755 --> 00:34:42,805
Speaker 16:  This has changed my life. I literally was

508
00:34:43,485 --> 00:34:47,005
Speaker 16:  suffocating thinking about how I was going to work every day because this

509
00:34:47,005 --> 00:34:50,845
Speaker 16:  is my office, you know, the the tablet and the phone. That's how I

510
00:34:50,845 --> 00:34:54,125
Speaker 16:  work. I have incoming emails from everybody that I work with and for of

511
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:57,325
Speaker 16:  my partners. And this is how I respond and can respond quickly

512
00:34:57,945 --> 00:34:59,805
Speaker 16:  and be able to actually type more than two sentences.

513
00:35:00,325 --> 00:35:04,125
Speaker 2:  I get it Ryan. I feel that too. But Typo didn't really work

514
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:07,805
Speaker 2:  out and none of the other projects trying to do this did either. And yet

515
00:35:07,825 --> 00:35:11,485
Speaker 2:  now all these years later, there's another company trying to pull it off.

516
00:35:11,715 --> 00:35:14,925
Speaker 2:  It's called Clicks and it's co-founded by a guy you might have heard of.

517
00:35:15,425 --> 00:35:19,285
Speaker 17:  I'm Michael Fisher. AKA Mr. Mobile or Captain Two phones. Take your

518
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:23,165
Speaker 2:  Pick. Michael's a long time creator and phone reviewer and he knows this

519
00:35:23,165 --> 00:35:27,005
Speaker 2:  space better than most, which made it frankly all the more surprising that

520
00:35:27,005 --> 00:35:30,485
Speaker 2:  this is a thing he decided to do. So I brought him onto the show to figure

521
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:34,405
Speaker 2:  out whether this idea has a chance to really succeed. Why he's convinced

522
00:35:34,405 --> 00:35:37,925
Speaker 2:  there's still room for a physical keyboard on your iPhone and what it takes

523
00:35:37,945 --> 00:35:41,725
Speaker 2:  to make a really great tiny little keyboard. And we just started the story

524
00:35:41,785 --> 00:35:45,765
Speaker 2:  at the beginning. Why would you in the year 2024 set

525
00:35:45,765 --> 00:35:47,725
Speaker 2:  out to build a physical smartphone keyboard?

526
00:35:48,825 --> 00:35:52,735
Speaker 17:  Oddly, the thing that was the germ of Clicks came to me. I actually, it

527
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:56,455
Speaker 17:  didn't originate from my brain. I got a call from a guy you probably are

528
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,655
Speaker 17:  familiar with, named CrackBerry Kevin. It's a guy who helped me build Mr.

529
00:35:59,655 --> 00:36:02,775
Speaker 17:  Mobile in the first place, kind of like one of my closer friends in the

530
00:36:02,975 --> 00:36:05,815
Speaker 17:  business. And he said, I gotta show you something. I will absolutely kill

531
00:36:05,815 --> 00:36:08,855
Speaker 17:  you If, you show anybody else what this is. And he sends me this 3D render

532
00:36:09,315 --> 00:36:12,975
Speaker 17:  and you know, you, you and I are in the same business for a lot of my day.

533
00:36:13,395 --> 00:36:16,655
Speaker 17:  you know what it's like to get something in your inbox that's like, you

534
00:36:16,655 --> 00:36:20,575
Speaker 17:  look at it, you take a beat and you say, oh my God, you you crazy bastards.

535
00:36:20,575 --> 00:36:24,455
Speaker 17:  You actually did it. So I. Think that's what I said out loud. but

536
00:36:24,455 --> 00:36:27,575
Speaker 17:  it was just a render. It wasn't even a product, it was just this very obviously

537
00:36:27,575 --> 00:36:31,415
Speaker 17:  an iPhone inserted into a case with a, with a Krty keyboard that looks nothing

538
00:36:31,415 --> 00:36:35,295
Speaker 17:  like it currently does. And I said in a profound demonstration

539
00:36:35,295 --> 00:36:38,775
Speaker 17:  of how little business foresight I have, I said, you know, Mr. Mobil has

540
00:36:38,775 --> 00:36:40,015
Speaker 17:  to have the exclusive on this. Right?

541
00:36:40,835 --> 00:36:43,135
Speaker 2:  That's good. Always, always thinking one step ahead, I guess.

542
00:36:43,135 --> 00:36:46,935
Speaker 17:  What an idiot. So within a week though, you know, I'm giving so much

543
00:36:46,935 --> 00:36:49,975
Speaker 17:  product feedback, we're talking all the time. It's very obvious that we

544
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:53,375
Speaker 17:  should be working together on this. Turns out that's what Kevin had in mind

545
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:56,935
Speaker 17:  the whole time. So I come aboard. We finish building the company with the

546
00:36:56,935 --> 00:37:00,215
Speaker 17:  guys who full credit deserve credit for the, for the initial germ of this

547
00:37:00,215 --> 00:37:03,855
Speaker 17:  idea in the first place. The veterans from FX tech, the, the last company

548
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:07,055
Speaker 17:  to make a truly great Android, you know, sliding keyboard smartphone. And

549
00:37:07,055 --> 00:37:07,815
Speaker 17:  that was, dude, that was

550
00:37:07,945 --> 00:37:08,295
Speaker 2:  April

551
00:37:08,715 --> 00:37:09,855
Speaker 17:  Of 2023.

552
00:37:10,075 --> 00:37:11,575
Speaker 2:  Oh wow. That was fast. Yeah.

553
00:37:11,635 --> 00:37:15,535
Speaker 17:  By January at CES we had a product that we were able to, we were ready to

554
00:37:15,615 --> 00:37:18,615
Speaker 17:  ship. So it what fast is right. It was insane.

555
00:37:18,845 --> 00:37:22,215
Speaker 2:  What I like about that though is that is a group of people who are maybe

556
00:37:22,445 --> 00:37:26,095
Speaker 2:  most prone to being incorrectly nostalgic about

557
00:37:26,415 --> 00:37:29,735
Speaker 2:  keyboards, right? You have, yeah, you have like some of the world's foremost

558
00:37:29,735 --> 00:37:33,495
Speaker 2:  BlackBerry people. You have you who has just never stopped making videos

559
00:37:33,505 --> 00:37:37,455
Speaker 2:  about the Palm Prix. True. And you have a bunch of

560
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:41,375
Speaker 2:  people who have like made these things in the past. So how do

561
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:45,255
Speaker 2:  you check yourself against like, boy I wish the world still existed

562
00:37:45,315 --> 00:37:48,775
Speaker 2:  in which we wanted keyboards versus like, this is a thing we should do and

563
00:37:48,775 --> 00:37:52,095
Speaker 2:  bring it back. So, or maybe you don't and you just soldier through and hope

564
00:37:52,095 --> 00:37:53,335
Speaker 2:  other people feel the same way you do.

565
00:37:53,895 --> 00:37:56,295
Speaker 17:  I think there was an element of that really. I mean we, one of the things

566
00:37:56,295 --> 00:37:58,535
Speaker 17:  we knew is we had a lot of smart people on board, right? And I won't give

567
00:37:58,535 --> 00:38:00,735
Speaker 17:  you the whole marketing pitch of everything, but we really do have the best

568
00:38:00,735 --> 00:38:03,575
Speaker 17:  people in the roles that need to be within the company and the, the most

569
00:38:03,575 --> 00:38:07,535
Speaker 17:  expertise there is. And at no point, you know, did we check ourselves all

570
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:10,175
Speaker 17:  the time? Yes. But at no point did anyone say, you know, I don't think this

571
00:38:10,175 --> 00:38:13,695
Speaker 17:  is the time really what I, I had to be sold on this. 'cause I was a little,

572
00:38:14,015 --> 00:38:17,535
Speaker 17:  I turned on my skepticism node for a hot second. I said, guys, is

573
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:21,615
Speaker 17:  is this it? Like no young person is going to even want a single

574
00:38:21,935 --> 00:38:24,815
Speaker 17:  physical button on this thing that they're like, what? What's going on?

575
00:38:25,275 --> 00:38:28,815
Speaker 17:  And it turns out that the time was right, not only for a variety of unrelated

576
00:38:28,815 --> 00:38:32,695
Speaker 17:  reasons, but because you can introduce this as a new concept to somebody

577
00:38:32,695 --> 00:38:36,165
Speaker 17:  like, not to name Drop Max Wach, who was like our most difficult briefing

578
00:38:36,305 --> 00:38:40,005
Speaker 17:  at CES, you know, was like, he's like 20, 22 and he is just like, I think

579
00:38:40,005 --> 00:38:43,445
Speaker 17:  this is ridiculous. But then you show him what happens when you are using,

580
00:38:43,505 --> 00:38:47,325
Speaker 17:  you know, Instagram live and you have your entire screen there and you

581
00:38:47,465 --> 00:38:50,525
Speaker 17:  go to type something and the virtual keyboard doesn't eat up 40% of it.

582
00:38:50,905 --> 00:38:53,365
Speaker 17:  Or you show somebody a keyboard shortcut and you're like, wait, what did

583
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:56,005
Speaker 17:  you do? And I'm like, well, I just hit the space bar and it advanced the

584
00:38:56,005 --> 00:38:59,005
Speaker 17:  screen for me. Or I hit, you know, whatever. Drop the notification shade.

585
00:38:59,345 --> 00:39:02,725
Speaker 17:  That's part of the fun. All the BlackBerry people know this stuff already.

586
00:39:02,865 --> 00:39:06,605
Speaker 17:  All the, you know, the people who had a palm trio like you and I maybe Yeah.

587
00:39:06,955 --> 00:39:10,565
Speaker 17:  Know all these things and, and to introduce it to somebody who was not alive

588
00:39:10,955 --> 00:39:14,245
Speaker 17:  when the, when the BlackBerry was a thing. It's pretty cool.

589
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:18,005
Speaker 2:  That's interesting. So we're actually like past nostalgia for a lot of people.

590
00:39:18,005 --> 00:39:21,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Where it's, it's so far gone that it's actually a new thing again.

591
00:39:21,075 --> 00:39:22,725
Speaker 17:  Yeah. It's a full circle. Exactly right.

592
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,605
Speaker 2:  But I would imagine for you as somebody who has used these things but not

593
00:39:25,605 --> 00:39:29,365
Speaker 2:  built them before, part of the process is just sort of learning how

594
00:39:29,465 --> 00:39:33,365
Speaker 2:  to learn a keyboard and like the vocabulary of it and yes.

595
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:37,365
Speaker 2:  What it means for a keyboard to be good or bad. 'cause I think as a user

596
00:39:37,425 --> 00:39:41,085
Speaker 2:  you have this instinctive feel. But I have to imagine that at some level

597
00:39:41,085 --> 00:39:44,805
Speaker 2:  there is like an objective measure of a good keyboard that you have to learn

598
00:39:44,865 --> 00:39:47,125
Speaker 2:  how to reckon with in this process. There

599
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:50,965
Speaker 17:  Is, so like the first prototype of Clicks I got to use had

600
00:39:50,965 --> 00:39:54,805
Speaker 17:  these domed transparent key caps. So we printed the

601
00:39:54,805 --> 00:39:58,565
Speaker 17:  characters below the, the surface of the key like a palm pri, right? Yeah.

602
00:39:58,565 --> 00:40:02,125
Speaker 17:  And because I'm so in forever in love with the palm pri until I die,

603
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:05,885
Speaker 17:  I loved it and I was like, oh, this looks so good and this is the the language

604
00:40:05,885 --> 00:40:09,645
Speaker 17:  we should be going for. And perfect. Well it turns out though that when

605
00:40:09,645 --> 00:40:13,085
Speaker 17:  you make a domed transparent key that is perfectly circular

606
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:17,085
Speaker 17:  in the design we were using. It looks great from head on and then you tilt

607
00:40:17,085 --> 00:40:20,885
Speaker 17:  that phone by 20 degrees and you can't tell what the letter is

608
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:23,085
Speaker 17:  because there's interesting, but there's visual warping, right? There's

609
00:40:23,085 --> 00:40:26,685
Speaker 17:  this skewing that happens. You're, is that a semicolon or a comma? I don't

610
00:40:26,685 --> 00:40:29,805
Speaker 17:  know what I'm doing anymore. So very quickly we had to make little decisions

611
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:33,565
Speaker 17:  like that. Like, well let's see what flat polycarbonate keys

612
00:40:33,835 --> 00:40:37,605
Speaker 17:  with, you know, satin printed top layer paint looks like. Well it turns

613
00:40:37,605 --> 00:40:41,045
Speaker 17:  out that's a lot better. So there's kind of major changes early on.

614
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:45,285
Speaker 17:  What I found surprising is you and I, we've covered phones a long time.

615
00:40:45,705 --> 00:40:49,645
Speaker 17:  you know how early on designs get locked in and you see people

616
00:40:49,645 --> 00:40:52,085
Speaker 17:  talking about why didn't they just make this change? 'cause we were giving

617
00:40:52,245 --> 00:40:55,685
Speaker 17:  'em feedback after the, after the unveiling, it's like, well, 'cause they

618
00:40:55,685 --> 00:40:58,805
Speaker 17:  were been sitting in retail boxes for three months at this point. With something

619
00:40:58,805 --> 00:41:02,685
Speaker 17:  like Clicks though we were making changes right up until the end at

620
00:41:02,865 --> 00:41:06,765
Speaker 17:  CES. We got the final keyboard while we were at the show. The thing we showed

621
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:10,445
Speaker 17:  everybody was kind of like a second to last revision. The final keyboard

622
00:41:10,445 --> 00:41:13,245
Speaker 17:  came in. It wasn't even built into the case. We're carrying around like

623
00:41:13,285 --> 00:41:16,325
Speaker 17:  a, like a component with no paint on it or anything. It's just like, okay,

624
00:41:16,325 --> 00:41:18,605
Speaker 17:  don't look at this, this is gross, but just close your eyes and feel it.

625
00:41:19,005 --> 00:41:22,365
Speaker 17:  And everyone we showed that to, we got the final sign off on it. Kevin was

626
00:41:22,365 --> 00:41:26,325
Speaker 17:  so excited. We're like, oh, that's it. Every nerd we trust has signed off

627
00:41:26,325 --> 00:41:29,645
Speaker 17:  on that. So dude, I go on forever. We had like a hundred revisions. It was,

628
00:41:29,825 --> 00:41:30,325
Speaker 17:  it was crazy.

629
00:41:30,845 --> 00:41:34,805
Speaker 2:  I will say I am most fascinated by like the last handful because I

630
00:41:34,805 --> 00:41:37,645
Speaker 2:  think I, I would assume, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but that you

631
00:41:37,645 --> 00:41:41,565
Speaker 2:  get through kind of 80% of the problem fairly quickly and you, you

632
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:45,365
Speaker 2:  settle on like the rough idea of the thing that you want and then you

633
00:41:45,365 --> 00:41:48,965
Speaker 2:  spend like the rest of your life until the heat death of the universe

634
00:41:49,365 --> 00:41:53,085
Speaker 2:  debating like tiny millimeters of everything. But that stuff does

635
00:41:53,085 --> 00:41:56,725
Speaker 2:  matter in these really like, hard to understand ways. So like the last 10

636
00:41:56,965 --> 00:42:00,525
Speaker 2:  revisions I think must have been so interesting and weird to go through.

637
00:42:00,795 --> 00:42:03,645
Speaker 17:  They were so wild because you're fighting, you're trying to integrate your,

638
00:42:03,715 --> 00:42:07,245
Speaker 17:  your personal history without being a, you know, without being slavish to

639
00:42:07,245 --> 00:42:11,165
Speaker 17:  it. Right? Hmm. So a good example is the shift in alt keys. Right up until

640
00:42:11,165 --> 00:42:14,685
Speaker 17:  close to the end they were swapped and I kept trying to switch to alternate

641
00:42:14,685 --> 00:42:17,805
Speaker 17:  characters and I kept messing it up and I'm like, all right, is this muscle

642
00:42:17,805 --> 00:42:20,165
Speaker 17:  memory or what? And we talked about it, we kind of went back and forth,

643
00:42:20,265 --> 00:42:23,125
Speaker 17:  got the whole team involved and it was like, no, we gotta swap those keys.

644
00:42:23,505 --> 00:42:26,165
Speaker 17:  And once we did, everything felt right again because what do you know you

645
00:42:26,165 --> 00:42:30,005
Speaker 17:  find the corner more easily. My least favorite change I think I talked

646
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:33,805
Speaker 17:  about in my video was I want that old number pad. Yeah.

647
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:37,765
Speaker 17:  I want the, you know, the, the three by three BlackBerry palm

648
00:42:38,005 --> 00:42:41,045
Speaker 17:  trio kind of number pad on the keyboard. Somebody much smarter than me on

649
00:42:41,045 --> 00:42:43,845
Speaker 17:  the team said, look, if we're designing the best iPhone physical keyboard,

650
00:42:44,345 --> 00:42:47,365
Speaker 17:  you gotta design it like the iOS virtual keyboard. You gotta give the number

651
00:42:47,385 --> 00:42:51,365
Speaker 17:  row up top. And I said, I hate that. You're right. I hate it. But

652
00:42:51,365 --> 00:42:54,605
Speaker 17:  you're right. I can't say you're wrong. That's what we gotta do. So little

653
00:42:54,835 --> 00:42:56,525
Speaker 17:  tiny changes like that. Have

654
00:42:56,525 --> 00:43:00,285
Speaker 2:  You gone back and retested all the old physical keyboards?

655
00:43:00,555 --> 00:43:04,365
Speaker 17:  It's so weird because I was using the Palm pri obviously most recently.

656
00:43:04,365 --> 00:43:08,005
Speaker 17:  And I was like, I remember writing for this keyboard back in the day when

657
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:11,125
Speaker 17:  I owned it in 2009 and I pick it up now and I'm like, Ooh,

658
00:43:11,935 --> 00:43:15,365
Speaker 17:  those keys barely move at all. And the Centro right. Where I was like, I

659
00:43:15,365 --> 00:43:17,685
Speaker 17:  could type fine on this in 2008. Nope. Even

660
00:43:17,685 --> 00:43:20,885
Speaker 2:  In 2008 I was like, this is too small with the central. I couldn't do it.

661
00:43:20,915 --> 00:43:21,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

662
00:43:21,905 --> 00:43:24,805
Speaker 17:  But you could use the sty on the buttons though, which was great. That is

663
00:43:24,805 --> 00:43:27,885
Speaker 17:  true. But other surprises in the other way. I'll get off Wabo s in a second.

664
00:43:27,885 --> 00:43:31,645
Speaker 17:  But real quick, the HPV hmm. World's tiniest keyboard phone

665
00:43:31,645 --> 00:43:35,085
Speaker 17:  that a lot of people made fun of. Very good keyboard for the footprint

666
00:43:35,745 --> 00:43:39,045
Speaker 17:  and for me best keyboard i I ever used but did not own

667
00:43:39,365 --> 00:43:40,725
Speaker 17:  Sidekick two. Oh

668
00:43:40,755 --> 00:43:41,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

669
00:43:41,355 --> 00:43:45,245
Speaker 17:  They like lovely clicky travel and, and feedback and also

670
00:43:45,245 --> 00:43:49,125
Speaker 17:  covered in that delightful silicone rubber that held onto your

671
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:53,085
Speaker 17:  thumbs and Oh man. Yeah. What's your, what's your favorite keyboard of

672
00:43:53,085 --> 00:43:54,045
Speaker 17:  all time? If, you don't mind me asking?

673
00:43:54,485 --> 00:43:57,645
Speaker 2:  I think If, you made me pick two. It would be the Trio six 50. Oh. Which

674
00:43:57,645 --> 00:44:01,485
Speaker 2:  I loved to pieces. I loved that phone and the

675
00:44:01,485 --> 00:44:04,485
Speaker 2:  Motorola queue, which I actually think If, you made me pick one is probably

676
00:44:04,485 --> 00:44:06,245
Speaker 2:  my answer. That keyword was amazing.

677
00:44:06,885 --> 00:44:09,765
Speaker 17:  I love, you know why I think the queue worked is 'cause you had this nice

678
00:44:09,765 --> 00:44:13,365
Speaker 17:  interplay of of materials. Mm. They were plastic hard keys, which doesn't

679
00:44:13,365 --> 00:44:16,205
Speaker 17:  sound nice, but the phone was soft touch. That's one of the things we were,

680
00:44:16,305 --> 00:44:19,525
Speaker 17:  we were doing on Clicks actually pretty late, was once we had the keys locked

681
00:44:19,525 --> 00:44:22,845
Speaker 17:  in, I was like, there's something still weird and missing about this. And

682
00:44:22,845 --> 00:44:26,125
Speaker 17:  it turned out it's what's around back. So we ended up putting that stamp

683
00:44:26,275 --> 00:44:30,005
Speaker 17:  like vegan leather back plate on there to, to make it feel, you know, to

684
00:44:30,005 --> 00:44:33,085
Speaker 17:  give you the entire tactile experience. 'cause you got, you know, eight

685
00:44:33,085 --> 00:44:35,805
Speaker 17:  other fingers that you gotta worry about when you're typing. Right. Right.

686
00:44:35,835 --> 00:44:38,805
Speaker 17:  What do they feel? But If, you look at those keys in cross-section, you'll

687
00:44:38,805 --> 00:44:42,365
Speaker 17:  notice they're domed over the top too. And that helps with, with

688
00:44:42,605 --> 00:44:45,245
Speaker 17:  determining separation of keys by touch. So you'll always have an easier

689
00:44:45,245 --> 00:44:48,485
Speaker 17:  time on a domed keyboard than you will on something where it's all crowded

690
00:44:48,565 --> 00:44:52,045
Speaker 17:  together. Like on the bold and the bold didn't do that 'cause it was a better

691
00:44:52,045 --> 00:44:54,925
Speaker 17:  typing experience. The bold did that because BlackBerry wanted a a narrower

692
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:58,165
Speaker 17:  phone. So it was, that's why you had those triangular frets in the corner.

693
00:44:58,185 --> 00:45:02,045
Speaker 17:  So they're like, the science of this stuff is fascinating and

694
00:45:02,045 --> 00:45:05,205
Speaker 17:  I'm so glad it's not lost to history because you can still talk to the people

695
00:45:05,205 --> 00:45:07,765
Speaker 17:  who designed it. They're like, oh this is why you did this. These are smart

696
00:45:07,765 --> 00:45:09,525
Speaker 17:  ideas. It's good to bring some of them back.

697
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:13,685
Speaker 2:  Tell me also about doing this in kind of the iPhone era, because I think

698
00:45:13,685 --> 00:45:17,285
Speaker 2:  people have tried and failed at this in part because the iPhone, it's good

699
00:45:17,285 --> 00:45:20,965
Speaker 2:  at what it does already. Yes. How do you like put those two things

700
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:21,805
Speaker 2:  together?

701
00:45:22,255 --> 00:45:25,965
Speaker 17:  First of all, one frankly made our jobs a lot easier is that we

702
00:45:26,065 --> 00:45:29,605
Speaker 17:  You don't have to do anything with Clicks. You don't have to install our

703
00:45:29,605 --> 00:45:32,605
Speaker 17:  app If. you don't want to, you literally plug an iPhone in and the iPhone

704
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:35,925
Speaker 17:  goes, you know, which uses the lightning port or the USB port and the iPhone

705
00:45:35,925 --> 00:45:39,085
Speaker 17:  says, oh that's a physical keyboard because all the hooks that it needs

706
00:45:39,085 --> 00:45:41,965
Speaker 17:  are built into iOS to begin with. So you just start typing and it's like,

707
00:45:42,115 --> 00:45:46,005
Speaker 17:  okay, well it turns out this product can handle it very well. And

708
00:45:46,005 --> 00:45:48,605
Speaker 2:  It's not nothing that that's the case by the way. And I think, I think a

709
00:45:48,605 --> 00:45:51,765
Speaker 2:  lot of people would be surprised that that's the case because there just

710
00:45:51,975 --> 00:45:55,765
Speaker 2:  isn't really a reason for the iPhone to do that. but it is surprisingly

711
00:45:55,765 --> 00:45:59,085
Speaker 2:  receptive to the existence of a physical keyboard.

712
00:45:59,645 --> 00:46:03,285
Speaker 17:  I think in terms of like a philosophical thing, I had a little bit of

713
00:46:03,525 --> 00:46:06,565
Speaker 17:  the same problem grasping it. At first it was like, gosh, what are we building?

714
00:46:06,905 --> 00:46:09,925
Speaker 17:  And then somebody said something very smart and they said, look, nobody

715
00:46:10,615 --> 00:46:14,485
Speaker 17:  looks twice, nobody thinks twice when you use an iPad with a magic

716
00:46:14,765 --> 00:46:17,485
Speaker 17:  keyboard. And then you say, well I don't really need the keyboard right

717
00:46:17,485 --> 00:46:19,765
Speaker 17:  now. So you take it off and then later you're gonna write an email and you

718
00:46:19,765 --> 00:46:23,685
Speaker 17:  put the keyboard back on. Like that is the definition of normal use

719
00:46:23,685 --> 00:46:27,365
Speaker 17:  case for that product. Why shouldn't the same thing be true of the phone?

720
00:46:27,665 --> 00:46:31,285
Speaker 17:  And the minute somebody put it in that lens for me, I was like, oh, oh okay

721
00:46:31,285 --> 00:46:35,085
Speaker 17:  good. And you know, we, we kind of hedge a little bit too because there's

722
00:46:35,085 --> 00:46:38,045
Speaker 17:  a button on Clicks so you can hit to call up the virtual keyboard. So like,

723
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:41,005
Speaker 17:  you know, there are times man, where I'm walking around and I'm like, I

724
00:46:41,005 --> 00:46:44,205
Speaker 17:  do not wanna type on a physical keyboard with one hand. It is annoying and

725
00:46:44,205 --> 00:46:47,085
Speaker 17:  slow and I don't like it. So that's the virtual keyboard and I can swipe

726
00:46:47,085 --> 00:46:50,885
Speaker 17:  around and stuff and I can use emojis and then I can put it away. So

727
00:46:50,885 --> 00:46:54,245
Speaker 17:  like, it's really about the adaptability for me. Like I, you know, it's

728
00:46:54,245 --> 00:46:58,205
Speaker 17:  eliminating buttons. Yeah, good call, had to do it, but it turns out

729
00:46:58,205 --> 00:47:00,845
Speaker 17:  there's a lot that you miss. So why not just have buttons when you want

730
00:47:00,845 --> 00:47:03,605
Speaker 17:  them? That was kind of our guiding philosophy after we figured out that

731
00:47:03,605 --> 00:47:04,325
Speaker 17:  we could actually make it.

732
00:47:05,035 --> 00:47:08,885
Speaker 2:  What have you seen in terms of like surprising cool stuff that you can do

733
00:47:09,225 --> 00:47:11,685
Speaker 2:  on the iPhone? I mean one of, one of the things I, you know, you've mentioned

734
00:47:11,685 --> 00:47:14,205
Speaker 2:  and I've seen you talk about elsewhere is just added screen real estate,

735
00:47:14,205 --> 00:47:18,085
Speaker 2:  right? Like you don't realize how big your phone screen is until

736
00:47:18,305 --> 00:47:20,285
Speaker 2:  you can actually see the whole thing. It's

737
00:47:20,285 --> 00:47:20,405
Speaker 17:  So

738
00:47:20,565 --> 00:47:23,645
Speaker 2:  Annoying. Which I think is real. I also wonder like you've been using these

739
00:47:23,645 --> 00:47:26,085
Speaker 2:  things longer than just about anybody, right? Like what have you seen in

740
00:47:26,085 --> 00:47:29,445
Speaker 2:  your own kind of phone usage life that is helped by a physical keyboard like

741
00:47:29,445 --> 00:47:29,565
Speaker 2:  this?

742
00:47:29,915 --> 00:47:33,845
Speaker 17:  Yeah. one of the, so the example that they make me do, that my colleagues

743
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:36,805
Speaker 17:  make me do on video, 'cause you're the creator, you're the influencer. Do

744
00:47:36,805 --> 00:47:40,045
Speaker 17:  the, do the live Instagram streaming thing and typing while you do it. I'm

745
00:47:40,045 --> 00:47:43,125
Speaker 17:  like, I don't, I don't care about that. What I care about is I'm in 85 group

746
00:47:43,125 --> 00:47:45,925
Speaker 17:  chats, right? And when you're in a group chat and you're looking at all

747
00:47:45,925 --> 00:47:48,685
Speaker 17:  the context of what people have said before, and then you go to respond

748
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:52,445
Speaker 17:  and then virtual keyboard pops up and then it clears half the screen stop

749
00:47:52,825 --> 00:47:56,765
Speaker 17:  So I love using Clicks for that specifically, but it it, it's

750
00:47:56,765 --> 00:47:59,885
Speaker 17:  kinda like an Easter egg hunt. There are all the the hot key shortcuts that

751
00:47:59,885 --> 00:48:02,605
Speaker 17:  work on the magic keyboard. Oh nice. Or at least a lot of 'em work And Clicks

752
00:48:02,605 --> 00:48:06,485
Speaker 17:  too. So there's that. And I go into every app and I try the old,

753
00:48:06,545 --> 00:48:09,525
Speaker 17:  the old BlackBerry shortcuts. Can I hit T to go to the top? Now I can't.

754
00:48:09,635 --> 00:48:13,085
Speaker 17:  What does space bar do? Oh that scrolls. Okay. Well this phone is really

755
00:48:13,085 --> 00:48:16,045
Speaker 17:  tall and now with Clicks it's even taller. So how do I get to the notification

756
00:48:16,045 --> 00:48:19,525
Speaker 17:  shade? Does Globe n work weirdly? Yes it does.

757
00:48:19,825 --> 00:48:23,005
Speaker 17:  And what is about shift space? Oh, that goes the other way. And like just,

758
00:48:23,175 --> 00:48:26,925
Speaker 17:  there are so many little old habits that I sort of forgot about

759
00:48:26,925 --> 00:48:30,805
Speaker 17:  from the days of reviewing all the old Cordy phones. And again

760
00:48:30,805 --> 00:48:34,685
Speaker 17:  to IOS's great credit, they didn't rip any of that stuff out. It's all just

761
00:48:34,685 --> 00:48:38,565
Speaker 17:  sitting there waiting to be utilized. My favorite is Globe and you know,

762
00:48:38,725 --> 00:48:41,685
Speaker 17:  Safari's got a ton of them, but I mostly just use the space bar to scroll

763
00:48:41,805 --> 00:48:42,205
Speaker 17:  'cause I'm lazy.

764
00:48:42,635 --> 00:48:46,485
Speaker 2:  Does it have, the thing that I love so much about the Blackberries, which

765
00:48:46,485 --> 00:48:49,045
Speaker 2:  is that if you're on the home screen and you just start typing, something

766
00:48:49,045 --> 00:48:49,285
Speaker 2:  happens.

767
00:48:49,785 --> 00:48:52,965
Speaker 17:  So on iOS you have to do, you have to invoke spotlight like you would on

768
00:48:52,965 --> 00:48:55,805
Speaker 17:  a MacBook. So you do command space and then you pop up. So

769
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:59,885
Speaker 2:  Craig Federighi, if you're listening and I know that you are, just get

770
00:48:59,885 --> 00:49:03,605
Speaker 2:  rid of that. Just let me start typing and it should pop up the spotlight.

771
00:49:03,775 --> 00:49:04,125
Speaker 2:  Right?

772
00:49:04,345 --> 00:49:04,645
Speaker 17:  Do you

773
00:49:04,765 --> 00:49:05,965
Speaker 2:  Remember that on the BlackBerry it was the best,

774
00:49:06,145 --> 00:49:06,765
Speaker 17:  It was the best.

775
00:49:06,765 --> 00:49:09,205
Speaker 2:  You're like, I wanna go to my calendar. I'm just gonna pull my phone outta

776
00:49:09,205 --> 00:49:12,085
Speaker 2:  my pocket and hit CAL and it's gonna take me to my calendar. But I think,

777
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:14,965
Speaker 2:  I mean that that comes back to kind of the question about, you know, all

778
00:49:14,965 --> 00:49:18,205
Speaker 2:  the other affordances we've made for the ways that people use phones now,

779
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:21,605
Speaker 2:  right? Like I think the swipe typing is an interesting one and my sense is

780
00:49:21,605 --> 00:49:25,565
Speaker 2:  that has kind of come and gone and just purely anecdotally, everybody I know

781
00:49:25,565 --> 00:49:29,405
Speaker 2:  who uses Android knows about the swipe typing and uses it. Especially when

782
00:49:29,405 --> 00:49:32,685
Speaker 2:  you're using your phone with one hand, no one I know who uses an iPhone even

783
00:49:32,685 --> 00:49:36,085
Speaker 2:  knows that that's a thing you can do. And like the space bar trick to move

784
00:49:36,085 --> 00:49:40,045
Speaker 2:  the cursor Yes. Is my favorite party trick because no one knows

785
00:49:40,045 --> 00:49:42,365
Speaker 2:  that's a thing and you show them and it just blows their mind to pieces.

786
00:49:42,545 --> 00:49:45,805
Speaker 2:  Yes. But that's the kind of stuff that all of these companies have spent

787
00:49:45,805 --> 00:49:49,365
Speaker 2:  this much time working on because they didn't have physical keyboards. And

788
00:49:49,365 --> 00:49:53,085
Speaker 2:  in a funny way, they're trying to solve for the problems of physical keyboards.

789
00:49:53,085 --> 00:49:56,085
Speaker 2:  Right. But also like once you got rid of them, you had to figure out a better

790
00:49:56,085 --> 00:49:58,925
Speaker 2:  way to move a cursor because you didn't have arrow buttons anymore. And like,

791
00:49:58,925 --> 00:50:02,645
Speaker 2:  you know what's great is arrow buttons. But now we've sort of come past that

792
00:50:02,705 --> 00:50:05,245
Speaker 2:  and so now you have to go back and say, okay, we have a physical keyboard.

793
00:50:05,625 --> 00:50:07,965
Speaker 2:  How do we make it do some touchscreen things?

794
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:09,565
Speaker 17:  Yes. Which is

795
00:50:09,585 --> 00:50:10,365
Speaker 2:  An interesting challenge.

796
00:50:10,585 --> 00:50:14,365
Speaker 17:  If you're utterly insane. How do we make an individual tiny touchscreen

797
00:50:14,365 --> 00:50:18,245
Speaker 17:  behind every button, which is what I want to do. I want you

798
00:50:18,365 --> 00:50:19,725
Speaker 17:  remember the Samsung alias? I do,

799
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:20,005
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

800
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:23,765
Speaker 17:  Yes. one of those. Let's put an e and Q screen behind it. Let's put an OLED

801
00:50:23,765 --> 00:50:27,350
Speaker 17:  behind every one of these. Let's make it $500 Clicks and see if, if anybody

802
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:27,760
Speaker 17:  buys it,

803
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,605
Speaker 2:  It'll be great. That's the full lunacy keyboard hinge

804
00:50:31,605 --> 00:50:33,205
Speaker 2:  thing that I'm, I'm, I'm very excited for.

805
00:50:33,465 --> 00:50:35,525
Speaker 17:  I'm gonna make that and then I'm retire, move to Mexico.

806
00:50:36,225 --> 00:50:39,805
Speaker 2:  Why start on the iPhone by the way, as opposed to starting with, you know,

807
00:50:40,065 --> 00:50:43,325
Speaker 2:  galaxy phones or pixel phones or trying to do something that is sort of universally

808
00:50:43,325 --> 00:50:46,365
Speaker 2:  Android. Like I've been spending some time with the backbone folks and they've

809
00:50:46,365 --> 00:50:49,285
Speaker 2:  been doing some really interesting work to try to figure out how do we make

810
00:50:49,305 --> 00:50:52,605
Speaker 2:  one thing that works for everybody. And I can imagine, you know, If, you

811
00:50:52,605 --> 00:50:56,245
Speaker 2:  build something that works for everybody, huge increase in the total available

812
00:50:56,245 --> 00:50:59,565
Speaker 2:  market, but also If, you build something for Android, you are more likely

813
00:50:59,585 --> 00:51:03,525
Speaker 2:  to hit the sort of phone nerd people who care about this stuff the way that

814
00:51:03,525 --> 00:51:05,485
Speaker 2:  you and I do. Why not start there?

815
00:51:05,835 --> 00:51:08,885
Speaker 17:  It's really about numbers. you know, honestly the, the total addressable

816
00:51:08,885 --> 00:51:12,205
Speaker 17:  market of, of iPhone users is something like 1.3 billion. Sure.

817
00:51:12,745 --> 00:51:16,525
Speaker 17:  And we know that Clicks is not for everybody. It's always fun

818
00:51:16,525 --> 00:51:18,965
Speaker 17:  when somebody offers up some wisdom to me on social media. Like, well, you

819
00:51:18,965 --> 00:51:22,645
Speaker 17:  know, this is, I'm, no one's gonna buy this. I'm like, okay,

820
00:51:22,945 --> 00:51:26,725
Speaker 17:  if one in 1000 people buy it and you're targeting a base of like,

821
00:51:26,785 --> 00:51:30,525
Speaker 17:  of iPhone users, like just from a sheer numbers perspective, it's, I have

822
00:51:30,525 --> 00:51:34,085
Speaker 17:  preferred Android for a long time. Sure. Partially because of the hardware

823
00:51:34,085 --> 00:51:37,005
Speaker 17:  diversity of that ecosystem. Right. So, I want to build one eventually,

824
00:51:37,105 --> 00:51:41,085
Speaker 17:  but again, you gotta work in stages as, as you well know, you have to

825
00:51:41,085 --> 00:51:44,005
Speaker 17:  start build a great product, build a healthy business on the back of that.

826
00:51:44,005 --> 00:51:47,685
Speaker 17:  And then you can do other things To your other question about like

827
00:51:47,825 --> 00:51:51,005
Speaker 17:  why not make a one size fits all? One definitely considered that. I mean

828
00:51:51,005 --> 00:51:54,965
Speaker 17:  we got close to announcing that it'll probably come in The

829
00:51:54,965 --> 00:51:58,445
Speaker 17:  future. There were just too many compromises. It doesn't look as good.

830
00:51:58,945 --> 00:52:02,885
Speaker 17:  You can't get as many cool certifications when it's not built

831
00:52:02,905 --> 00:52:05,725
Speaker 17:  for a very specific type of iPhone. Right. Oh, interesting. Sure. And, and

832
00:52:05,725 --> 00:52:08,645
Speaker 17:  it, I hate to keep harping on the aesthetics, but we really wanted to ship

833
00:52:08,645 --> 00:52:12,245
Speaker 17:  something that wasn't this kind of klugy, I won't name, name drop any

834
00:52:12,485 --> 00:52:14,565
Speaker 17:  previous efforts, but like, you know, something that just doesn't look very

835
00:52:14,565 --> 00:52:18,365
Speaker 17:  good, doesn't feel like it was purpose built for the phone. You

836
00:52:18,365 --> 00:52:20,325
Speaker 17:  spent what, $1,100 on,

837
00:52:20,905 --> 00:52:24,445
Speaker 2:  So let's say, you know, launch goes well. Everything comes out over the next

838
00:52:24,445 --> 00:52:28,085
Speaker 2:  few months. What's next for Clicks? Like I, I know I've seen you're gonna

839
00:52:28,085 --> 00:52:30,885
Speaker 2:  do, your plan is to do more colors and do drops and that kind of stuff. But

840
00:52:30,885 --> 00:52:33,805
Speaker 2:  I also feel like the thing that I've learned about hardware startups over

841
00:52:33,805 --> 00:52:37,285
Speaker 2:  the years is that getting the first one out the door is borderline

842
00:52:37,285 --> 00:52:40,805
Speaker 2:  impossible. It's a huge amount of work. You have to talk to a bunch of manufacturers

843
00:52:40,805 --> 00:52:44,285
Speaker 2:  and companies that don't know you and don't care about you. But then If,

844
00:52:44,285 --> 00:52:48,005
Speaker 2:  you can If you can do the thing, prove you can do it, prove you're serious,

845
00:52:48,395 --> 00:52:52,045
Speaker 2:  like the world kind of opens up to you a little bit and you strike me as

846
00:52:52,205 --> 00:52:55,765
Speaker 2:  somebody who has some pretty wild ideas about where all of this could go.

847
00:52:56,145 --> 00:53:00,125
Speaker 2:  Do you feel like there is tons of runway left in like the footprint of

848
00:53:00,125 --> 00:53:02,885
Speaker 2:  a keyboard? Do you have big ideas about other stuff you want to add in, like

849
00:53:03,175 --> 00:53:04,725
Speaker 2:  tease The future a little bit For me,

850
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:08,405
Speaker 17:  This is not true what I'm about to say, but

851
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:13,085
Speaker 17:  perfect. So, but to an extent, you know, I

852
00:53:13,085 --> 00:53:16,885
Speaker 17:  almost wish the beginning portion was as

853
00:53:17,035 --> 00:53:20,845
Speaker 17:  harrowing as you described. But because we have so many people in the right

854
00:53:20,845 --> 00:53:24,725
Speaker 17:  places, we don't have as many of those problems as we might, as we might

855
00:53:24,725 --> 00:53:28,605
Speaker 17:  otherwise. So we've had to think ahead of time ahead

856
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:32,245
Speaker 17:  of when I would prefer to think about these larger conceptual questions,

857
00:53:32,245 --> 00:53:35,365
Speaker 17:  these vision questions of like, at some point you have to ask yourself,

858
00:53:35,365 --> 00:53:38,205
Speaker 17:  well what are we gonna do? Like you just said, are we just gonna own buttons

859
00:53:38,205 --> 00:53:42,165
Speaker 17:  on, on mobile phones or are we gonna be the kind of company that asks, well

860
00:53:42,165 --> 00:53:45,485
Speaker 17:  what else can click? Look, I have

861
00:53:45,975 --> 00:53:49,365
Speaker 17:  giant, crazy dumb ideas in the latter category

862
00:53:49,825 --> 00:53:53,485
Speaker 17:  and we have a very solid opportunity to make a, to make a pretty good business

863
00:53:53,485 --> 00:53:57,045
Speaker 17:  in the former category. But I'll be honest with you, it's not clear which

864
00:53:57,045 --> 00:54:00,605
Speaker 17:  direction we will go. 'cause we still do have to focus on getting,

865
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:04,125
Speaker 17:  you know, we've shipped Founder's edition that's thousands of units, but

866
00:54:04,235 --> 00:54:08,125
Speaker 17:  it's not the main production run. So we're gonna take the time that we

867
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:12,005
Speaker 17:  have right now to to, to deliver the best possible Gen One product to all

868
00:54:12,005 --> 00:54:14,725
Speaker 17:  the people who wanna buy 'em. And then we'll have, I'll have a better answer

869
00:54:14,725 --> 00:54:16,285
Speaker 17:  for you this time next year. That's

870
00:54:16,285 --> 00:54:19,205
Speaker 2:  A very good and very diplomatic answer. Thank you. And I appreciate that.

871
00:54:19,315 --> 00:54:22,845
Speaker 2:  That is, that is someone who has been in a company for a while and I'm, I'm

872
00:54:22,845 --> 00:54:25,765
Speaker 2:  proud of you for that. Thanks man. Okay. So I won't ask you to tell me The

873
00:54:25,765 --> 00:54:29,605
Speaker 2:  future, give me one huge wild idea that there's

874
00:54:29,845 --> 00:54:32,165
Speaker 2:  absolutely no chance you're ever gonna build because it's impossible for

875
00:54:32,165 --> 00:54:32,845
Speaker 2:  one reason or another.

876
00:54:33,265 --> 00:54:36,365
Speaker 17:  You remember there was a, there was an old Kierra that ran, PAOs didn't

877
00:54:36,365 --> 00:54:39,725
Speaker 17:  even have a color screen. We're talking 2001, I think it was a 7 71 something

878
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:43,645
Speaker 17:  and it had a touchscreen but it had a stowaway

879
00:54:44,055 --> 00:54:47,685
Speaker 17:  detachable numeric keypad that attached via a hinge on the bottom

880
00:54:47,985 --> 00:54:50,405
Speaker 17:  and If. you didn't wanna take it all the way off. You could flip it around

881
00:54:50,405 --> 00:54:52,125
Speaker 17:  back so it would get outta the way. This

882
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:54,365
Speaker 2:  Is a very 2001 device you're describing. I love it. Thank

883
00:54:54,365 --> 00:54:57,765
Speaker 17:  You. That's all I'm here to do is spring back the path. I wanna make one

884
00:54:57,965 --> 00:55:01,285
Speaker 17:  of those for the galaxy flip five or the, or the razor. I wanna make a Clicks

885
00:55:01,285 --> 00:55:04,765
Speaker 17:  that that flips around back and then flips up forward and overlaps the screen

886
00:55:05,265 --> 00:55:08,685
Speaker 17:  and gives you a physical query keyboard that you can then flip away and

887
00:55:08,685 --> 00:55:11,925
Speaker 17:  put around back. It would sell at least 127 units.

888
00:55:12,405 --> 00:55:16,365
Speaker 17:  119 would probably fail. We will never build it. But I would like to

889
00:55:16,365 --> 00:55:16,645
Speaker 17:  build it.

890
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:20,205
Speaker 2:  Why not have more mechanisms? That's right. Right. It's just like, what if

891
00:55:20,205 --> 00:55:21,765
Speaker 2:  instead of a hinge, we had several hinges.

892
00:55:21,765 --> 00:55:22,765
Speaker 17:  Exactly How

893
00:58:31,625 --> 00:58:34,565
Speaker 2:  All right, we're back. Let's get to the Hotline as always. The number is

894
00:58:34,565 --> 00:58:38,445
Speaker 2:  8 6 6 Verge one one and the email is Vergecast at The Verge dot com.

896
00:58:41,285 --> 00:58:45,085
Speaker 2:  try to answer at least one on the show every week. First of all, again, thank

897
00:58:45,085 --> 00:58:48,245
Speaker 2:  you to everybody who is calling in about TikTok and the Apple antitrust stuff.

898
00:58:48,245 --> 00:58:51,925
Speaker 2:  We're gonna get back to both of those a bunch in the next few weeks. So keep

899
00:58:52,085 --> 00:58:54,845
Speaker 2:  calling. Tell us everything you think we got right? Tell us everything you

900
00:58:54,845 --> 00:58:57,765
Speaker 2:  think we got wrong. Tell us all of your feelings about all of it. We wanna

901
00:58:57,765 --> 00:59:00,605
Speaker 2:  hear everything. For now we have a question from Michael.

902
00:59:01,915 --> 00:59:05,445
Speaker 21:  This is Michael from Madison. So my parents are getting older and I'm looking

903
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:09,485
Speaker 21:  to record them sharing family stories so we have them for

904
00:59:10,165 --> 00:59:13,845
Speaker 21:  next generations and I was looking for advice

905
00:59:13,945 --> 00:59:17,805
Speaker 21:  on what to buy microphone wise to record my parents

906
00:59:17,805 --> 00:59:21,605
Speaker 21:  talking like Ken Burn style, like a cute couple. Any advice

907
00:59:21,745 --> 00:59:23,445
Speaker 21:  on what to do would be great. Thanks.

908
00:59:24,265 --> 00:59:26,805
Speaker 2:  All right. First of all, I believe strongly that everyone should make Ken

909
00:59:26,815 --> 00:59:30,165
Speaker 2:  Burns documentaries about their family. This is an extremely good idea. Second

910
00:59:30,165 --> 00:59:33,085
Speaker 2:  of all, Andru Marino is here to help me answer this question. Andru so much

911
00:59:33,085 --> 00:59:34,645
Speaker 2:  of you on the show today, this makes me very happy.

912
00:59:34,925 --> 00:59:36,085
Speaker 5:  I know what's up. You

913
00:59:36,085 --> 00:59:39,925
Speaker 2:  Have come prepared with what I assume is just a large slew

914
00:59:39,925 --> 00:59:43,645
Speaker 2:  of microphones. This question gets more complicated the longer I think about

915
00:59:43,645 --> 00:59:46,445
Speaker 2:  it. Yeah. Which is why I'm very glad you're here. So take us through it.

916
00:59:46,445 --> 00:59:47,565
Speaker 2:  What are your, what are your thoughts on this?

917
00:59:47,955 --> 00:59:51,365
Speaker 5:  Okay, so I'm not sure what Michael is actually using to record

918
00:59:51,785 --> 00:59:55,765
Speaker 5:  So. I have a couple options that will give a hybrid of of options

919
00:59:55,765 --> 00:59:59,485
Speaker 5:  you can use. Right now I'm actually using one of the microphones,

920
00:59:59,665 --> 01:00:03,365
Speaker 5:  the Road Wireless Me Road has a like a

921
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:07,365
Speaker 5:  slew of wireless microphones now. Yeah. That you could just plug

922
01:00:07,435 --> 01:00:10,805
Speaker 5:  into your phone or plug into a camera or into an audio

923
01:00:11,365 --> 01:00:15,125
Speaker 5:  recorder. They're super easy to use This look a little square,

924
01:00:15,305 --> 01:00:17,605
Speaker 5:  you just kind of Oh, a big square.

925
01:00:18,195 --> 01:00:18,925
Speaker 2:  It's a big square.

926
01:00:19,325 --> 01:00:21,565
Speaker 5:  Yeah. You clip onto your lapel. These

927
01:00:21,565 --> 01:00:25,045
Speaker 2:  Are the ones that have like the, the receiver you plug into your phone or

928
01:00:25,245 --> 01:00:29,045
Speaker 2:  computer or whatever and then the actual mic is what you put on whoever

929
01:00:29,045 --> 01:00:31,205
Speaker 2:  you're talking to. Right. And then they automatically connect to each other.

930
01:00:31,595 --> 01:00:31,885
Speaker 2:  Yeah,

931
01:00:31,885 --> 01:00:35,565
Speaker 5:  Exactly. So, what I do a lot is I'll plug the

932
01:00:36,165 --> 01:00:39,725
Speaker 5:  receiver into my phone and I'll record a voice memo or

933
01:00:39,915 --> 01:00:43,805
Speaker 5:  with Rhodes Recorder app or like take a video and we'll

934
01:00:43,805 --> 01:00:47,565
Speaker 5:  take the audio from the road wireless for the audio input.

935
01:00:47,665 --> 01:00:51,005
Speaker 5:  That's a great option because you can, it's very versatile If. you want to

936
01:00:51,195 --> 01:00:54,925
Speaker 5:  make video If, you want to be walking around If, you like

937
01:00:55,115 --> 01:00:59,085
Speaker 5:  parents are like cooking dinner, like moving around and all that.

938
01:00:59,195 --> 01:00:59,885
Speaker 2:  Yeah, that's good.

939
01:01:00,305 --> 01:01:04,245
Speaker 5:  The other one I have is the A TR 2100

940
01:01:04,605 --> 01:01:08,365
Speaker 5:  XUSB mic from Audio Technica. What I like about it is

941
01:01:08,475 --> 01:01:12,005
Speaker 5:  it's a USB microphone that's also an XLR

942
01:01:12,095 --> 01:01:16,045
Speaker 5:  microphone. So If you wanna plug into your laptop,

943
01:01:16,235 --> 01:01:20,045
Speaker 5:  into your tablet, into your phone. You can use this microphone but

944
01:01:20,045 --> 01:01:23,725
Speaker 5:  also you can just use it into any mobile audio recorder that has an XLR

945
01:01:23,725 --> 01:01:27,085
Speaker 5:  input or your audio interface or anything. That's a great option. We send

946
01:01:27,085 --> 01:01:30,765
Speaker 5:  these mics to everyone on staff for The. Vergecast. Yeah.

947
01:01:30,765 --> 01:01:34,325
Speaker 2:  This is the mic that I tell people like If, you don't wanna spend several

948
01:01:34,325 --> 01:01:37,525
Speaker 2:  hundred dollars on a pro podcasting mic but you want

949
01:01:37,745 --> 01:01:41,645
Speaker 2:  90% of the quality. I make people buy this mic. Like I have

950
01:01:41,645 --> 01:01:44,445
Speaker 2:  recommended this mic to so many people who wanna do podcasts.

951
01:01:44,755 --> 01:01:48,725
Speaker 5:  Yeah. And they're very cheap right now. I'm looking on B and H

952
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:51,645
Speaker 5:  and it's $49. Oh wow. Which is,

953
01:01:51,745 --> 01:01:52,805
Speaker 2:  That's a really good deal.

954
01:01:52,995 --> 01:01:54,445
Speaker 5:  Half the price of what they usually are.

955
01:01:54,445 --> 01:01:57,605
Speaker 2:  Yeah. This thing is a good deal at a hundred dollars, much less than $50.

956
01:01:57,955 --> 01:01:58,245
Speaker 2:  Okay.

957
01:01:58,565 --> 01:02:02,325
Speaker 5:  I should also mention that the road wireless packs range from

958
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:06,365
Speaker 5:  200 to $300. Depending what version you want to get. Those are

959
01:02:06,365 --> 01:02:07,605
Speaker 5:  a little more expensive. So

960
01:02:07,605 --> 01:02:10,565
Speaker 2:  Here's my question for you on this one though. I feel like there's a version

961
01:02:10,565 --> 01:02:14,205
Speaker 2:  of this that is like sit with your, your two parents, right? That's what

962
01:02:14,205 --> 01:02:16,645
Speaker 2:  you wanna do. You wanna, you wanna have them sit on a couch and talk to each

963
01:02:16,645 --> 01:02:20,565
Speaker 2:  other. Do you give them each a mic and plug it into a recorder or do

964
01:02:20,565 --> 01:02:23,205
Speaker 2:  you like set the mic on a table and kind of point it between them?

965
01:02:23,665 --> 01:02:27,045
Speaker 5:  Oh, that's a good question. So I actually did this with my friends recently.

966
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:30,925
Speaker 5:  I interviewed them at their kitchen table and I had two of the

967
01:02:30,925 --> 01:02:34,765
Speaker 5:  microphones, one for each person. That's the ideal situation. That's like,

968
01:02:35,005 --> 01:02:38,605
Speaker 5:  I want the best recording. You can totally just put

969
01:02:38,655 --> 01:02:42,285
Speaker 5:  table and have them talk into both of 'em. Like a little press

970
01:02:42,285 --> 01:02:45,885
Speaker 5:  conference thing. But since they're so cheap, like

971
01:02:46,035 --> 01:02:49,525
Speaker 5:  it's worth getting two maybe one for you, one for your guest

972
01:02:49,755 --> 01:02:50,485
Speaker 5:  kind of thing too.

973
01:02:50,675 --> 01:02:54,045
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I mean a a hundred bucks plug these two things into your

974
01:02:54,845 --> 01:02:58,685
Speaker 2:  computer. They each come with, if memory serves like a really crappy but

975
01:02:58,685 --> 01:03:02,565
Speaker 2:  kind of useful little stand so you could be kinda all in for a hundred

976
01:03:02,565 --> 01:03:05,165
Speaker 2:  dollars on this project and have pretty solid audio.

977
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:08,685
Speaker 5:  Yeah. That's actually the re another reason why I recommend it is it comes

978
01:03:08,685 --> 01:03:09,285
Speaker 5:  with a stand.

979
01:03:09,515 --> 01:03:12,445
Speaker 2:  It's not a good stand but it is a stand. Yes. And that comes for something.

980
01:03:13,645 --> 01:03:16,165
Speaker 2:  Alright, you said you had one more, right? What's the, what's the third option?

981
01:03:16,515 --> 01:03:20,005
Speaker 5:  Okay, so this is the Sennheiser MKE

982
01:03:20,105 --> 01:03:22,525
Speaker 5:  600. Right now it goes for about

983
01:03:22,695 --> 01:03:26,325
Speaker 5:  $350. This is more of a professional

984
01:03:26,495 --> 01:03:30,365
Speaker 5:  microphone. I use this a lot for podcasting field recordings

985
01:03:30,505 --> 01:03:33,925
Speaker 5:  or maybe I'm over someone's house and I'm

986
01:03:33,925 --> 01:03:37,765
Speaker 5:  interviewing them. I love the crispness of this microphone.

987
01:03:38,505 --> 01:03:39,365
Speaker 5:  How do you think it sounds?

988
01:03:39,585 --> 01:03:42,805
Speaker 2:  It sounds really good. I, I can only see a little bit of it on your screen,

989
01:03:42,805 --> 01:03:46,685
Speaker 2:  but this looks like a kind of proper shotgun mic. Yes,

990
01:03:46,715 --> 01:03:47,205
Speaker 5:  Exactly.

991
01:03:47,475 --> 01:03:50,325
Speaker 2:  That. Like this is the kind of thing that you stick on a boom arm and hold

992
01:03:50,325 --> 01:03:53,965
Speaker 2:  over somebody's head on a film shoot like that that's, this is a much more

993
01:03:53,965 --> 01:03:55,845
Speaker 2:  professional thing than either of the other two it seems.

994
01:03:56,075 --> 01:04:00,005
Speaker 5:  Yeah. This is a great one for like indie filmmakers. Even If,

995
01:04:00,005 --> 01:04:03,845
Speaker 5:  you wanna just put it on top of the camera, but I love it just on a

996
01:04:03,975 --> 01:04:07,965
Speaker 5:  stand on a desk pointing right in front of the person's mouth has

997
01:04:07,965 --> 01:04:11,645
Speaker 5:  just like a very detailed sound. If, you want the Ken

998
01:04:11,895 --> 01:04:15,805
Speaker 5:  Burns documentary style, then this is a great choice and it's

999
01:04:15,805 --> 01:04:18,925
Speaker 5:  affordable among the more professional microphones.

1000
01:04:19,195 --> 01:04:23,085
Speaker 2:  Yeah, the, the microphone world, especially in this realm of these

1001
01:04:23,085 --> 01:04:25,765
Speaker 2:  like shotgun boom mics can get really expensive really fast, but there's

1002
01:04:25,765 --> 01:04:29,525
Speaker 2:  definitely, especially for our purposes here, you hit the kind of

1003
01:04:29,765 --> 01:04:33,645
Speaker 2:  diminishing returns plateau pretty fast. Like just hearing you now, this

1004
01:04:33,645 --> 01:04:36,965
Speaker 2:  sounds really good. I don't know that you would necessarily for like human

1005
01:04:37,365 --> 01:04:40,885
Speaker 2:  archival purposes want something notably better than this. Yeah,

1006
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:44,765
Speaker 5:  I, I think so. And this is just an XLR microphone by the way. So

1007
01:04:44,985 --> 01:04:48,965
Speaker 5:  you would need either an audio interface or an audio recorder that has an

1008
01:04:49,345 --> 01:04:51,965
Speaker 5:  XLR input. Okay. Which is why I offer the others. Wait,

1009
01:04:52,005 --> 01:04:55,605
Speaker 2:  I want you to do one test for me here really quickly though. Yeah. Just move

1010
01:04:55,605 --> 01:04:58,645
Speaker 2:  around a little while you talk. Tell me sorry. 'cause this is the problem

1011
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:01,805
Speaker 2:  with these shotgun mics right? Is you have to be like sort of perfectly in

1012
01:05:01,805 --> 01:05:04,285
Speaker 2:  front of it and it sounds amazing, but If you move sometimes they get weird.

1013
01:05:04,555 --> 01:05:08,405
Speaker 5:  Yeah. So I'm talking to the left of it right now, which is

1014
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:11,165
Speaker 5:  off axis a little bit. You're gonna hear less of the clarity.

1015
01:05:12,425 --> 01:05:15,765
Speaker 5:  I'm going back to the center and I'm going to the right, go a little further

1016
01:05:15,875 --> 01:05:16,165
Speaker 5:  back.

1017
01:05:16,595 --> 01:05:16,885
Speaker 2:  Okay.

1018
01:05:17,075 --> 01:05:20,885
Speaker 5:  Usually when they have this shotgun mic you can go pretty far back because

1019
01:05:20,945 --> 01:05:23,845
Speaker 5:  it can catch your voice pretty far away.

1020
01:05:24,035 --> 01:05:27,725
Speaker 2:  Yeah. When you go back you get quieter but you're still very clear. But as

1021
01:05:27,725 --> 01:05:30,125
Speaker 2:  soon as you get off access, like it starts veering into

1022
01:06:02,165 --> 01:06:06,045
Speaker 2:  obviously gonna be the answer. But I feel like the lapel mic is really

1023
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:06,445
Speaker 2:  useful

1024
01:06:38,885 --> 01:06:39,605
Speaker 5:  why I chose these.

1025
01:06:39,835 --> 01:06:43,765
Speaker 2:  Awesome. Well Michael, I hope that helps. Please let us know which one
