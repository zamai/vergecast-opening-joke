Description: In episode one of our miniseries all about connectivity, The Verge’s David Pierce talks with Ilya Pozin, founder and CEO of Telly, a new startup promising to give you a free 55-inch TV with an additional second screen for ads and apps.
Before founding Telly, Ilya Pozin also founded PlutoTV, one of the first and most successful ad-based streaming services. There are many similarities between these two companies, and Ilya has a grander vision for how he sees the world and how he thinks he can revolutionize the TV hardware and TV show business.

00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,340
Speaker 3:  Welcome. To. The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of the second screen

3
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,140
Speaker 3:  experience. I'm your friend David Pierce, and this is the first episode

4
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,700
Speaker 3:  in a new miniseries we're doing about connectivity. But I don't mean

5
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,300
Speaker 3:  connectivity in the like five g change everything

6
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:01,020
Speaker 3:  sense or the let's test some wifi speeds sense,

7
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,540
Speaker 3:  either. Those are fine, but that's not what we're talking about. For the

8
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,140
Speaker 3:  next four Mondays, we're gonna talk about how we connect online,

9
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,420
Speaker 3:  how we connect to each other, how we connect to the stuff that we care about,

10
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,660
Speaker 3:  how we make connections that are private and personal and safe

11
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,540
Speaker 3:  and make sense. It's a big digital universe out there

12
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,540
Speaker 3:  and connecting all of it and us is hard, but important

13
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,260
Speaker 3:  work. For our first episode, we're gonna talk about content. Obviously the

14
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,220
Speaker 3:  internet completely changed the way that we watch, listen, read

15
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,020
Speaker 3:  and everything else. I mean, really, it wasn't that long ago

16
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:39,820
Speaker 3:  that the only way to access something was to get in your car and go to a

17
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,700
Speaker 3:  store and buy it. Now the whole universe of content is available, like

18
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,020
Speaker 3:  from your phone. You don't even have to get up off the couch. But that has

19
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,780
Speaker 3:  its own set of challenges. We're all signed up for a million increasingly

20
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,500
Speaker 3:  expensive subscriptions. We spend way too much time scrolling

21
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,220
Speaker 3:  through streaming services instead of actually watching the content on them.

22
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,180
Speaker 3:  You're stuck upgrading your tv, your phone, your everything, every couple

23
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,740
Speaker 3:  of years just to keep up with it all. I'm pretty sure making you go to Blockbuster

24
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,660
Speaker 3:  and Sam Goody back in the day was not the perfect solution, but I'm not sure

25
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,620
Speaker 3:  this is either. Over the last few years I've

26
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,420
Speaker 3:  talked to a lot of people with ideas about how the content ecosystem

27
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,300
Speaker 3:  might change, but I don't think I've met anyone with ideas quite

28
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,060
Speaker 3:  as big and quite as wacky as this guy.

29
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,980
Speaker 4:  Hey, I'm Billy Pose and I'm the founder and c e o of Telly.

30
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:31,180
Speaker 3:  Telly is a new startup, like it hasn't officially launched any of its

31
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,340
Speaker 3:  products yet, but I think you might have heard of it. It's the one promising

32
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,180
Speaker 3:  to give you a free 55 inch four K TV with a

33
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,100
Speaker 3:  second screen below it that Telly thinks it can sell ads and apps on to

34
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,900
Speaker 3:  make up for the money it loses by giving you a tv. Telly is either

35
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,500
Speaker 3:  the best or the worst idea I've heard in a really long time,

36
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,860
Speaker 3:  and I sincerely don't know which one, it's before he founded

37
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,940
Speaker 3:  Telly. Ilya also founded PlutoTV, which was one of the first and is still

38
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,720
Speaker 3:  one of the most successful ad based streaming services. His big

39
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,400
Speaker 3:  idea was people don't have infinite money to pay for streaming,

40
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:09,440
Speaker 3:  let's make one for free. And it worked. There's a lot of similarities

41
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,200
Speaker 3:  between those two companies and those two ideas. And there's a bigger vision

42
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,000
Speaker 3:  in there for how Ilya sees the world and how he thinks he can

43
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,840
Speaker 3:  change both the TV hardware and the TV show business.

44
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,560
Speaker 3:  That is what we're gonna talk about today, the future of the biggest screen

45
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,440
Speaker 3:  in your house and the way that we find and connect with the content we care

46
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:28,640
Speaker 3:  about.

47
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,120
Speaker 3:  But before we got into that, I wanted to start the conversation with Ilya

48
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,720
Speaker 3:  by going all the way back to the PlutoTV days.

49
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,000
Speaker 4:  So back in 2013 when we saw the entire

50
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,000
Speaker 4:  kind of streaming ecosystem change, right? Everyone started going on

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,880
Speaker 4:  televisions to open up their apps, right? You had publishers like Netflix

52
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:53,880
Speaker 4:  that went from mobile and desktop environments to the,

53
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,560
Speaker 4:  to the tv, right? And yeah, the idea that everyone was launching subscription

54
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,480
Speaker 4:  services was great, but there was an opportunity, I believe, to,

55
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,080
Speaker 4:  to have a free television experience. Like when you went on YouTube,

56
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,320
Speaker 4:  that was free, right? You're, you're able to browse You know various videos,

57
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,320
Speaker 4:  but there was nothing, no curated experience, nothing that felt

58
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,400
Speaker 4:  like tv, nothing that served you up content when you didn't actually want

59
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,040
Speaker 4:  to think, right? And, and we always had this theory at PlutoTV where from

60
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,880
Speaker 4:  an on-demand perspective, on demand is really, really good if You know what

61
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,560
Speaker 4:  you're looking for. But if you don't know what you're looking for, it's a

62
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,000
Speaker 4:  horrible experience, right? Because how, how do you search for something

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,320
Speaker 4:  where you don't know what to search for? So that was the theory behind PlutoTV,

64
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,080
Speaker 4:  is can we create a linear television experience and deliver it

65
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,480
Speaker 4:  completely free, right? Can we go out there and find content that

66
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,560
Speaker 4:  maybe isn't on, maybe it's third window, fourth window, right? Isn't on television

67
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,920
Speaker 4:  anymore and isn't being monetized anymore, but it's still valuable and people

68
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,240
Speaker 4:  still wanna see it. And, and can we, can we create a revenue model where

69
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,280
Speaker 4:  maybe it's a rev share type deal, similar to a YouTube play with short form

70
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,080
Speaker 4:  videos, but we did that with a long form content and, and, and recreate this

71
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,240
Speaker 4:  kind of TV experience. And we did just that, right? Initially we launched

72
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,000
Speaker 4:  on web mobile, but very quickly we built an experience that

73
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,200
Speaker 4:  You know on television, we, we quickly became the number one free app on

74
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,120
Speaker 4:  platforms like Roku and Amazon Fire TV and so forth.

75
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,640
Speaker 3:  So is that two separate insights, the idea that there is a

76
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,120
Speaker 3:  way to do this without charging a subscription fee and

77
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,480
Speaker 3:  people need something that isn't quite linear tv, but also isn't quite

78
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,800
Speaker 3:  on demand? Like is that two separate things that you built the company on,

79
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,680
Speaker 3:  or is there an overlap of that Venn diagram?

80
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,080
Speaker 4:  It was two separate things, but they kind of converged, right? So the idea

81
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,840
Speaker 4:  that cable companies were double dipping where you were paying for a cable

82
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,840
Speaker 4:  subscription fee and then you were watching content with advertising. I mean,

83
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,360
Speaker 4:  that to me was, was always one of those kind of mind boggling instances that

84
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,760
Speaker 4:  that was right for disruption. We proved that at PlutoTV, right? Where

85
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,120
Speaker 4:  we said, you can run a very sustainable business on just one one of

86
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,880
Speaker 4:  those monetization streams alone, right on just advertising. And if you look

87
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,600
Speaker 4:  at PlutoTV today, You know, fast forward You know 10 years, it's done over

88
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,200
Speaker 4:  a billion dollars in ad revenue alone with You know 80 million plus consumers,

89
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,120
Speaker 4:  right? Yeah. So, and then the other was the curated

90
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,840
Speaker 4:  linear TV experience where You know my original idea with

91
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,280
Speaker 4:  PlutoTV was actually with my daughter sitting on my lap, and I was working

92
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,200
Speaker 4:  on one monitor and I was on YouTube picking out You know kids' videos on

93
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,680
Speaker 4:  the other monitor. She was two years old at that time, and I just learned

94
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,320
Speaker 4:  how to change diapers and I didn't know anything about kids' content. I didn't

95
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,120
Speaker 4:  know what to search for. So I was like, All, right? Let me, let me try to

96
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,520
Speaker 4:  find this kind of linear TV experience with internet content and it didn't

97
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,640
Speaker 4:  exist, right? That was the original hypothesis. So I, so I built a prototype,

98
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,560
Speaker 4:  I put it out there, and we then drove some users to it, and right away

99
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,480
Speaker 4:  we saw like 36 or 40 minute session durations. And at that

100
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,520
Speaker 4:  point, YouTube was getting three and a half minute sessions, right? So we

101
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,560
Speaker 4:  knew that this curated experience worked. And I said, okay, well we were

102
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,520
Speaker 4:  living in this era of cord cutting. Everyone's cutting the cord, the writings

103
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,200
Speaker 4:  on the wall, right? Because consumers didn't want to pay twice,

104
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,560
Speaker 4:  right? So can we create an experience where it's actually monetized on a

105
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,000
Speaker 4:  single revenue stream, right?

106
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,520
Speaker 3:  Yeah. And I think one of the things that's been very funny since then is

107
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,720
Speaker 3:  the world has kind of come around to that way of thinking, right? Everybody

108
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,640
Speaker 3:  now has an ad supported thing, as is an ad supported tier of

109
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,040
Speaker 3:  their subscription. They still wanna also charge you money for it and also

110
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,600
Speaker 3:  show you ads, which is very funny. Like we're still in the old cable world,

111
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,880
Speaker 3:  but also now we're in this place where this idea that it's hard to find

112
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,400
Speaker 3:  stuff to watch. And actually maybe we should just curate it for you so that

113
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,560
Speaker 3:  you can turn it on. And like, one of the good things about cable was channel

114
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,120
Speaker 3:  surfing. Like we got away from channel surfing for a long time and everybody's

115
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,960
Speaker 3:  kind of coming back to it. But 10 years ago, I kind of feel

116
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,760
Speaker 3:  like the industry thought you were just wrong. That like, this was not the

117
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,200
Speaker 3:  future. You can't make money in avod, you can't make money from curation

118
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,840
Speaker 3:  on demand. Is the future like not a chance? Am I overstating

119
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,360
Speaker 3:  kind of the forces against you?

120
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,960
Speaker 4:  No, it was, it was spot on. I I, I've, for a long time I didn't think PlutoTV

121
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,720
Speaker 4:  was gonna happen. Yeah. I've never felt so rejected in my life on all

122
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,280
Speaker 4:  sides, right? From we, we went out to capital to get capital from investors.

123
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,560
Speaker 4:  I think we had 93 noss before we had a yes. Wow. Right? We,

124
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,760
Speaker 4:  'cause look, we're we're entering the market that seemed like it was going

125
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,600
Speaker 4:  subscription on demand. And we said, no, we're going linear and ad

126
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,520
Speaker 4:  supported, and everyone thought we're completely crazy. And also a lot of

127
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,920
Speaker 4:  the, a lot of the people that are writing checks from an investment perspective,

128
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,920
Speaker 4:  You know they have the means of the capital to go out there and pay for service

129
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,880
Speaker 4:  and re remove ads, and they're like, ads are bad, right? So, so naturally

130
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,600
Speaker 4:  we just didn't, didn't fit within that mold. And then on the other end, from,

131
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:32,400
Speaker 4:  from the content perspective, right? As you mentioned, all the content owners,

132
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,480
Speaker 4:  now, all the media companies have ad supported tiers, but back

133
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,160
Speaker 4:  then we went to, we went to them to get content and they also laughed us

134
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,600
Speaker 4:  out of the room like, no, we're going, we're licensing our content. There's

135
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,520
Speaker 4:  no way we're giving to you on a rev share basis and ad support and forget

136
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,200
Speaker 4:  it. We're we're going subscription. So they thought we were crazy too.

137
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,960
Speaker 3:  What was the point it started to turn? Like do you remember like a thing

138
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,840
Speaker 3:  happening where you were like, okay, we were not wrong about this?

139
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,400
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I, I mean, so the data was there from the, from the get go, right?

140
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:03,200
Speaker 4:  Where consumers showed us that they actually love this

141
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,520
Speaker 4:  curated linear experience. And we were doing this with like two, three minute

142
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,080
Speaker 4:  videos from YouTube at that point, right? Sure. We're just short form content,

143
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,800
Speaker 4:  but when we stitched it together until long form experience, it worked.

144
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,880
Speaker 4:  And people loved the whole channel surfing idea. They loved the curation,

145
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,360
Speaker 4:  they loved not thinking, and we even went like out of our way to

146
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,120
Speaker 4:  remove the ability to like restart a show. If you, if you came in at

147
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,360
Speaker 4:  8:08 PM to PlutoTV, you watched the same thing at the same time as everyone

148
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,040
Speaker 4:  else, even if it was like four minutes into an existing clip, right? And,

149
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,160
Speaker 4:  and we brought that kind of nostalgic thing back and it worked from a consumer

150
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:38,120
Speaker 4:  side, but then I remember, I think it was Lionsgate that gave us

151
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,160
Speaker 4:  a chance, right? And said, All, right? Look, let's give you some older content.

152
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,360
Speaker 4:  We're not monetizing it currently. Let's put it up there. We will do a rev

153
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,000
Speaker 4:  shared deal and, and let's see what happens, right? And we started

154
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,120
Speaker 4:  writing a bigger check, and then the, the bigger check we wrote, right?

155
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,960
Speaker 4:  The better the content they gave us, the better the content they gave us,

156
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,920
Speaker 4:  the more people watched. And we started getting into this, into this flywheel,

157
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,560
Speaker 4:  right? Right. And then You know th and then the industry kind of started

158
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,000
Speaker 4:  to, to hear that, hey, like this is actually happening. Consumers are growing,

159
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,240
Speaker 4:  revenues growing, this is becoming a sizable opportunity. And

160
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,120
Speaker 4:  others started giving us a chance, right? And once again, it started with

161
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,640
Speaker 4:  older, older content. And then as the content got better and newer,

162
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:21,720
Speaker 4:  everything kind of started going up and the flywheel started turning in a

163
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,120
Speaker 4:  faster way.

164
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,920
Speaker 3:  Got it. Okay. So draw the line from that to

165
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,760
Speaker 3:  tele for me, because I feel like there's a bunch of, like the market condition

166
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,560
Speaker 3:  stuff you described in the like TV content industry

167
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,520
Speaker 3:  that is also true of the TV set industry. You're also making a

168
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,440
Speaker 3:  similar bet on ads versus You know money. But like how

169
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,200
Speaker 3:  do you get from from PlutoTV to Telly?

170
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,280
Speaker 4:  Yeah, yeah. No, great question. So at PlutoTV, we partnered with

171
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,360
Speaker 4:  every TV manufacturer out there, right? Because, and, and then we saw the

172
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,880
Speaker 4:  writing on the wall. They, they came to us and, and we quickly realized

173
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,760
Speaker 4:  they don't make any money selling TVs, right? Right. There's like TVs have

174
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,720
Speaker 4:  hit this commodity state where there's no margin to hardware,

175
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,800
Speaker 4:  it's a race to the bottom on price. And when you don't have any margin in

176
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,600
Speaker 4:  the hardware, you also have no innovation, right? So right now, when you're

177
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,960
Speaker 4:  looking at a TV in your home, I'm sure you have one on your wall and everyone

178
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,080
Speaker 4:  else does, but you don't really know, is it three months old? Is it three

179
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,440
Speaker 4:  years old? Has it been there for 10 years? It looks exactly the same, right?

180
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,480
Speaker 4:  And that's when, when kind of the light bulb hit, if you will, right? Where

181
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,440
Speaker 4:  if, if everyone's coming to us to get a piece of our ad revenue because

182
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,360
Speaker 4:  they don't make any money selling hardware, right? And you can't, if you

183
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,160
Speaker 4:  can't make any hard money selling hardware, why fight for that tiny margin

184
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,200
Speaker 4:  anyway? Right? Why not build a product in a way that you can give away and

185
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,480
Speaker 4:  quickly take the market like we did with PlutoTV?

186
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,480
Speaker 3:  So wait, so just hang on, explain that part out really fast, because if,

187
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,800
Speaker 3:  if I'm understanding you correctly, basically, when you're at PlutoTV, you're

188
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,600
Speaker 3:  You know building an app for all these TV operating systems and such,

189
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,920
Speaker 3:  but part of the appeal of working with PlutoTV is that the TV

190
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,960
Speaker 3:  manufacturers can figure out how to get a cut of your rev

191
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,760
Speaker 3:  share. And that's the only way they're making any money. And I actually feel

192
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,680
Speaker 3:  like, like I pause on this because I think this is a part of the TV business,

193
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,240
Speaker 3:  people don't understand that. Like, there's money in outrageously

194
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,920
Speaker 3:  expensive, like a hundred inch Samsung televisions a little,

195
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,000
Speaker 3:  but this like T C L behind me, like TCL l's not making any money that's

196
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,840
Speaker 3:  interesting to anybody on here. They're all making money on like the

197
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,800
Speaker 3:  weird spyware stuff that they put on, and they're all making money on

198
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,080
Speaker 3:  the ads that they show you, right? Like, that is what the business has become,

199
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,000
Speaker 3:  even for the people who make the hardware

200
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:32,400
Speaker 4:  Completely. And it's no different than the double dipping I mentioned on

201
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,640
Speaker 4:  the cable side, right? Where they're right now, TV makers are selling you

202
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,200
Speaker 4:  a tv, they're monetizing your data, they're selling advertising, they're

203
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,040
Speaker 4:  getting a cut of advertising from streaming services like PlutoTV, and, and

204
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,240
Speaker 4:  they're selling, they have their own programming now they're selling their

205
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,120
Speaker 4:  own ads, so they're double dipping, right? So, so once again, if you're in

206
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,960
Speaker 4:  a business where you're not making money on the hardware, similar to PlutoTV,

207
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,840
Speaker 4:  we felt like if you could take away one of the revenue streams, you can quickly

208
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,520
Speaker 4:  take that market. But you're, you're absolutely right. As part of the deals

209
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,600
Speaker 4:  with PlutoTV, every TV maker, You know, got a cut of of that revenue.

210
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:06,000
Speaker 3:  Okay? So then I can imagine the leap from there to, well,

211
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,760
Speaker 3:  if this is the business already, why don't we just make this the

212
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,840
Speaker 3:  business? That's

213
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,000
Speaker 4:  Right. That's right. Okay. And You know, the way to the way we also looked

214
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,840
Speaker 4:  at it is it was very difficult to build PlutoTV for every TV

215
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,360
Speaker 4:  manufacturer. And and that's because they're all trying to optimize the tiny

216
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,800
Speaker 4:  amount of margin they had. So the, the processors, the memory,

217
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,320
Speaker 4:  the stuff that goes inside the TV that's on your wall now is very

218
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,960
Speaker 4:  weak. Yeah. And, and You know the way we looked at, it's, it's 2023

219
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,520
Speaker 4:  TVs are the biggest screen in your home, but they're the dumbest, right?

220
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,880
Speaker 4:  They're, they're drastically underpowered, right? There's very little that

221
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,600
Speaker 4:  they can do to go beyond streaming, right? Like you've, you even saw like

222
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,440
Speaker 4:  Netflix and others try to get into, into gaming, and it's so hard to do

223
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,280
Speaker 4:  gaming when, when your processor is like as weak as an a t m machine, right?

224
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,960
Speaker 4:  Right. So, so when, when we looked at, at building tele, like,

225
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,760
Speaker 4:  don't let the price point fool you of free, right? This is not a

226
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:02,640
Speaker 4:  budget tv. We said, let's build actually the smartest

227
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,480
Speaker 4:  TV on the market, right? So let's disrupt it from a TV perspective. What

228
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,320
Speaker 4:  would, if we were to build a TV right now in 2023, what would it do?

229
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,040
Speaker 4:  And if you look at the market, look, look what happened, because TVs haven't

230
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,520
Speaker 4:  innovated, right? There's no margin to innovate. So there's been no innovation

231
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,360
Speaker 4:  whatsoever. So what happened, we had speakers pop out, we had

232
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,480
Speaker 4:  assistance, we had You know mirror come out with a fitness

233
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,400
Speaker 4:  device for $800, which is literally a screen and a camera. All of these

234
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,760
Speaker 4:  different devices popped out into the market. And frankly,

235
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,000
Speaker 4:  I, we believe that a TV should have been doing that all along, right? And

236
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,520
Speaker 4:  if there was any room for innovation, and if TV companies were actually figuring

237
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,720
Speaker 4:  out how to drive an actual improvement of their product, rather than just

238
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,600
Speaker 4:  making the screen thinner or making it four K to eight k, I think they just

239
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,120
Speaker 4:  missed a mark of what consumers actually want, right? Yeah. And if you

240
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:53,040
Speaker 4:  recall, when the iPhone came out, it killed a bunch of other devices very

241
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,520
Speaker 4:  quickly. There used to be cameras at Best Buy, those went away,

242
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,760
Speaker 4:  used to buy like a Tom Tom or a Garmin g p s that went away, right?

243
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,680
Speaker 4:  So like music players portal music. So the iPhone killed a bunch of devices.

244
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,880
Speaker 4:  We expect the same thing to happen here, right? So Telly is the

245
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,960
Speaker 4:  smartest TV on the market, right? It's got great speakers, right? You've

246
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,440
Speaker 4:  got a, a camera that lets you do Zoom, calling fitness mo, You know

247
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,320
Speaker 4:  gaming, motion tracking gaming. It's got a full assistant built

248
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:24,000
Speaker 4:  in. So you can say, Hey, Telly, put on Spotify or whatever you want. You're

249
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,880
Speaker 4:  playing music through it. It's got all your extra widgets from

250
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,640
Speaker 4:  like sports scores and news and whatever. And, and it's, it's so much more

251
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,000
Speaker 4:  than a tv, right? Imagine like somebody rings your Ring doorbell and their

252
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,520
Speaker 4:  video appears in the bottom, or you do a Zoom call with your friends or family

253
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,720
Speaker 4:  across town, then their videos are on that bottom screen and you're watching

254
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,640
Speaker 4:  the same, let's say, football game on the top screen, and now you're watching

255
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,640
Speaker 4:  together, right? And there's some really other interesting things that like

256
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,440
Speaker 4:  we're building and innovating that goes well, well beyond, beyond tv,

257
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:56,240
Speaker 3:  Right? Yeah. And I, I, I wanna get to that in just a second, but I think

258
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,960
Speaker 3:  the, the last version of the, like, why on earth are you building a TV

259
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,640
Speaker 3:  question I have is basically like the iPhone example is really interesting,

260
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,520
Speaker 3:  right? And I think where we are in the TV market is essentially

261
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,480
Speaker 3:  like deciding to build a camcorder 20 years

262
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:14,560
Speaker 3:  after the iPhone comes out. Like, this market is dead. Everybody agrees there's

263
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,600
Speaker 3:  no money in it. Everybody is like desperately trying to find something else

264
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,400
Speaker 3:  to do. Like I've been a proponent the last several years of like, bring back

265
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:25,360
Speaker 3:  dumb TVs, right? Like, I think there is a, a compelling case to make that

266
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,840
Speaker 3:  all of the interesting stuff should happen in set top boxes. It should happen

267
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,720
Speaker 3:  in Soundbars whatever, because you can buy a big display that is

268
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,960
Speaker 3:  gonna keep being good for a very long time, put all the smart stuff somewhere

269
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,680
Speaker 3:  else, and then upgrade the parts that you need while this still

270
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,640
Speaker 3:  very good four K display gets to sit on my wall for a decade, even though

271
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,440
Speaker 3:  all of the parts inside it are gonna become outdated. So for you,

272
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,320
Speaker 3:  even as you come into this saying, You know, we wanna figure out how to disrupt

273
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,240
Speaker 3:  the space. You look around, why build the set

274
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,960
Speaker 3:  itself? There's so many other ways you could have attacked the TV market

275
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,360
Speaker 3:  rather than building big screens. Why decide to build big screens?

276
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,600
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I mean, I, I think when you, when you look, when you look at the market,

277
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,320
Speaker 4:  it's even from a streaming perspective, it's so fragmented, right?

278
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,600
Speaker 4:  And people are using different apps and different services and, and

279
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,440
Speaker 4:  cables kind of taking a nose dive, right? There's, there's, people are switching

280
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,680
Speaker 4:  apps and htm I ports and from gaming to everything else, I think the, the,

281
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,840
Speaker 4:  the TV is really the, the glue of the entire home, right? It's

282
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,680
Speaker 4:  the, it's the way you really connect, not only all the smart

283
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,520
Speaker 4:  devices that are external, but also the family. And, and it's, it's where

284
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,720
Speaker 4:  people stay together, right? People come home with their families, they sit

285
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,280
Speaker 4:  in front of the tv and it's kind of like the last part that keeps everyone

286
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,440
Speaker 4:  together. And when you live in this kind of fragmented environment with content

287
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,120
Speaker 4:  living in different places, there's a conflict of interest between the

288
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,560
Speaker 4:  consumer and those content owners. Because everyone wants you to be within

289
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,680
Speaker 4:  their app, app. They don't wanna promote other apps. But the one You know,

290
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,520
Speaker 4:  kind of Switzerland, if you will, neutral place that, that can keep all those

291
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,160
Speaker 4:  things together is the actual hardware and the television, right? So I think

292
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:03,120
Speaker 4:  that that's where we see the opportunity is we can build a content

293
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,080
Speaker 4:  recommendation engine that is agnostic of, of what services you're

294
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,160
Speaker 4:  subscribed to, right? We can help you find content or, or

295
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,280
Speaker 4:  services that are like for you that based on your profile that are

296
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,480
Speaker 4:  different than, than someone else's. So I think that's really the, the opportunity

297
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,680
Speaker 4:  and with, with so many different options for hardware and

298
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,440
Speaker 4:  different devices and smart home and IOT kind of growing, and once again,

299
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,440
Speaker 4:  these different services, you need something that glues together and, and

300
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,960
Speaker 4:  the hardware and the kind of TV becomes that central point

301
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:35,680
Speaker 3:  That makes total sense to me. And I think is kind of the central question

302
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,600
Speaker 3:  of tele for me, which I think is part of why this company is so fun, because

303
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,800
Speaker 3:  you're either dead, right? That this idea that the TV should be

304
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,600
Speaker 3:  much more than it is has only not happened because of essentially

305
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,480
Speaker 3:  like lack of incentive and innovation, or it hasn't happened yet

306
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,000
Speaker 3:  because you're wrong and smartphones are gonna be that thing, or glasses

307
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,720
Speaker 3:  are gonna be that thing. Or like Alexa everywhere is gonna be that thing.

308
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,360
Speaker 3:  And essentially the TV's job is only going to become less and less over time

309
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,600
Speaker 3:  and only time will tell. But I think like for people who live in the

310
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,880
Speaker 3:  world, it's actually one of the most interesting technology questions at

311
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,640
Speaker 3:  the moment is like, what is the job of a television in the next decade?

312
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,280
Speaker 3:  I think it's such a fascinating question in a way that we've never really

313
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,920
Speaker 3:  asked before because the job of a television has been to watch things, right?

314
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,200
Speaker 3:  Like it was, it was a furniture piece that you watch stuff on, and then it

315
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,400
Speaker 3:  became smaller, and then it got flat screen and then it got higher res. But

316
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,240
Speaker 3:  it's fundamentally like we watch shows and movies, And, what you're talking

317
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,920
Speaker 3:  about is like a fundamentally much bigger, broader, wider

318
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,480
Speaker 3:  cooler vision for what a TV could be that no one has ever really

319
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,240
Speaker 3:  all the way tried to execute before. Yeah. Why don't you think anyone

320
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,240
Speaker 3:  has tried that? Like, to the full extent of what you're talking about?

321
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,440
Speaker 4:  I think it's timing, it's product market fit. You can have the greatest idea,

322
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,640
Speaker 4:  but release it at the wrong time and it won't work, right? Sure. And I'm

323
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,040
Speaker 4:  sure there's been plenty of attempts at PlutoTV before Pluto's time, but

324
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:58,040
Speaker 4:  it's, it's all about coming in at the right time when, when different parts

325
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,880
Speaker 4:  of the market are, are kind of right for disruption. And, and in my view,

326
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,720
Speaker 4:  the there's no better time to disrupt a category when it hits that commodity

327
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:09,560
Speaker 4:  state when there's very little brand loyalty. You know

328
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,400
Speaker 4:  to You know to purchasing a TV when a consumer walks into Costco and

329
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,920
Speaker 4:  there's 8 55 inch TVs in front of them and just, they just, they're all good.

330
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:20,560
Speaker 4:  They're all the same specs and they look at what's in sale and that's what

331
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,640
Speaker 4:  they buy. And, and that's when something really has an opportunity to be

332
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,160
Speaker 4:  disrupted, right? And I, I I think that timing is there. I think broadband

333
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,080
Speaker 4:  connections are, are now obviously a, a normal state. Yeah. I think it

334
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,160
Speaker 4:  took time for that to happen. I, and I think because we live in this kind

335
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,720
Speaker 4:  of court cutting, You know a different app ecosystem,

336
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,520
Speaker 4:  fragmented world with a bunch of different devices popping up, it's becoming

337
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,400
Speaker 4:  very difficult from a consumer perspective to know what to get to know

338
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,720
Speaker 4:  what to You know, to what to subscribe to. Where's my favorite show here?

339
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,280
Speaker 4:  You know, should I get this assistant or that assistant? I need a speaker,

340
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,720
Speaker 4:  I need this, I need that. It needs something to glue it all together. At

341
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,520
Speaker 4:  the end of the day, as I said earlier, the TV is, has the perfect opportunity

342
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,760
Speaker 4:  to do it because it is the biggest screen in the home. It's what keeps the

343
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,120
Speaker 4:  family together. Of course, we've got our iPhones and they're more than capable

344
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,120
Speaker 4:  of, of doing what our TVs do, but it's, it's a single use, e

345
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,920
Speaker 4:  experience with one consumer, no one's gathering around around their iPhones,

346
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,840
Speaker 4:  right? So I think that TV is, is more than capable of doing that. And if

347
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,720
Speaker 4:  you look at, at Telly, it's, I I always kind of make this analogy to a car

348
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,480
Speaker 4:  in a, in a weird way because the top screen is kind of like your

349
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,960
Speaker 4:  windshield, right? Okay. That'ss your main focus. That's what your You know.

350
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,640
Speaker 4:  That's where your content plays, that's your driving. But imagine a car

351
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,080
Speaker 4:  without a dashboard. Imagine you didn't have a speedometer, a radio,

352
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,560
Speaker 4:  a nav, like all the other things to kind of enhance your, your viewing experience.

353
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,360
Speaker 4:  We have to accept that right now we live in a multi-screen world,

354
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:47,320
Speaker 4:  right? And if we're watching a football game or a movie, everyone

355
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,240
Speaker 4:  around us is on their phones, right? That's a huge distraction. They're taking

356
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,400
Speaker 4:  their phones out, they're looking at You know scores. Maybe they're betting

357
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,760
Speaker 4:  on a game or whatever it is, right? Like, oh, lemme see what actors in that

358
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,920
Speaker 4:  movie. Lemme let's check out your Rotten Tomatoes reviews before you pick

359
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,080
Speaker 4:  something. But imagine doing that right there on that single screen right

360
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,120
Speaker 4:  in front of you, right? You're, you're browsing Netflix titles and the Rotten

361
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,000
Speaker 4:  Tomatoes reviews just show up right there below you. That's, that's what

362
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,920
Speaker 4:  a car's dash does, right? As as you're driving. And, and, and that's

363
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,640
Speaker 4:  why we believe this kind of dual screen approach solves so many

364
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,320
Speaker 4:  problems, right? Because if you're a TV maker, you can't

365
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:24,160
Speaker 4:  overlay someone else's content, right? Sure. Unless you're, maybe you're

366
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,320
Speaker 4:  Amazon, you've got the device and you've got the content, you have some opportunities

367
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,960
Speaker 4:  to enhance it, and you could see a lot of what they're doing. And I think

368
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,920
Speaker 4:  that's fantastic, right? But if, if you want to stay neutral,

369
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,000
Speaker 4:  right? And you wanna be able to do it across the board, you've gotta do it

370
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,520
Speaker 4:  on a device and you've gotta do it on a device that lets you do that agnostic

371
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,280
Speaker 4:  of whether you have You know that opportunity with the media companies

372
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,360
Speaker 3:  You just named a lot of things that are very hard to execute. Which I think

373
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,120
Speaker 3:  is, again, part of why this is gonna be really interesting, like, just to,

374
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,560
Speaker 3:  just to pull it one, right? This question of there's a lot of stuff on a

375
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,440
Speaker 3:  lot of different services. How do you find this stuff to watch? Like, everyone

376
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,560
Speaker 3:  has tried that, that's not like, it's not like an unknown problem, right?

377
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,440
Speaker 3:  And then Netflix just has no interest in playing

378
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,160
Speaker 3:  nicely and the metadata of all of it is a mess. And so

379
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:10,040
Speaker 3:  like that alone, you could have built a big company trying to solve

380
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,360
Speaker 3:  and that's, you're just, that's just like one small feature of this thing.

381
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,720
Speaker 3:  I guess part of what I'm trying to figure out is like, especially as you

382
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,920
Speaker 3:  start thinking about building Telly, you're like, okay, we're gonna be a

383
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,640
Speaker 3:  hardware company. We wanna do a lot of stuff, A lot of it's software, a lot

384
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,400
Speaker 3:  of it's hardware. We wanna do a lot of things. Like how, how do you figure

385
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,000
Speaker 3:  out sort of where to start? Like what's the, you you need a way in that is

386
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,920
Speaker 3:  compelling, that is new and different and going to like, get people

387
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,880
Speaker 3:  interested in a TV that isn't just like, whatever cheap one I can find best,

388
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,600
Speaker 3:  find it best Buy. How do you sort of pick those first couple of spots

389
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,080
Speaker 3:  to try and press at?

390
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:47,520
Speaker 4:  Yeah, no, that's a great question. And, and look, and you said we're a hardware

391
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,320
Speaker 4:  company. We're, we don't operate like a hardware company, okay? We're, we're

392
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,240
Speaker 4:  very much running this like a software company, right? And, and a

393
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,200
Speaker 4:  media company where hardware is just, is is a box. Obviously you

394
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,360
Speaker 4:  have to check 'cause we You know that's the product we're building. Sure.

395
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,040
Speaker 4:  But we're very much treating it almost like a Tesla where You know,

396
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:07,880
Speaker 4:  let's overload it with extra hardware and sensors and computing power. And

397
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,520
Speaker 4:  every two to four weeks let's push updates to make this thing better and

398
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,040
Speaker 4:  better and start unlocking capabilities that go beyond beyond

399
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,320
Speaker 4:  television, right? At a core, when we're building this, I mean, first and

400
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,320
Speaker 4:  foremost, you have to build a good product. You know, luckily in the TV world,

401
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:25,960
Speaker 4:  there are a a, there's like four ODMs that make the majority of

402
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,800
Speaker 4:  televisions. Like, so our screen is made by the second largest TV panel manufacturer

403
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,640
Speaker 4:  in the world. They make 20% of all the TVs, right? For all the major brands.

404
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,760
Speaker 4:  So you don't have to kind of reinvent the wheel, right? Right. Like that's,

405
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,600
Speaker 4:  that's kind of the position you're in when you're in a commodity business,

406
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:44,080
Speaker 4:  right? Is there are a lot of support layers to help you

407
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,520
Speaker 4:  build a product that's very comparable in the market. And that's why you

408
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,480
Speaker 4:  see a lot of newcomers, like, like the Rokus of the world, for example, going

409
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:54,760
Speaker 4:  into the TV space, right? I mean obviously there's challenges, but there

410
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,080
Speaker 4:  are also a lot of ways, a lot of things that have already been done where

411
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,680
Speaker 4:  you don't have to reinvent the wheel. Yeah. If

412
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,520
Speaker 3:  Your job is just like make a television that will display things that look

413
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,720
Speaker 3:  pretty good. Yeah. That's not that hard anymore.

414
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,640
Speaker 4:  It's not. And, but that was our, like from a product perspective, TV

415
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,800
Speaker 4:  1 0 1 is what we called it internally. Sure. That was first and foremost

416
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,160
Speaker 4:  our goal. Let's, this thing has gotta work like any other TV period, right?

417
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,920
Speaker 4:  But then we started looking at what are the big problems that exist right

418
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,800
Speaker 4:  now? Okay, well first of all, TVs are so thin now and they're, because there's

419
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,320
Speaker 4:  no margin and people wanna make money from something else. So they're, they're

420
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,320
Speaker 4:  selling you a soundbar. Well that's kind of like a shitty experience. Like

421
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,800
Speaker 4:  what I just bought a tv, now you're forcing me to buy a speaker. Like, let's

422
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,760
Speaker 4:  include that, right? Like let's make that part of it. Right. And the same

423
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,560
Speaker 4:  thing with a camera. Like once again, like once you try Telly and you do

424
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,440
Speaker 4:  a Zoom call on a big screen where, where people look life

425
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:47,160
Speaker 4:  size, you don't want to, you don't want to do a video call on any other platform.

426
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,960
Speaker 4:  It's, it's just, it's, it's completely game changing. So that's kind of the

427
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,760
Speaker 4:  way we look at, it's let's look at things that are people are doing on other

428
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:58,640
Speaker 4:  devices that we can bring to this device from a central perspective,

429
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,480
Speaker 4:  right? Like, like video calling and gaming and, and having great

430
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,120
Speaker 4:  speakers and having an assistant like there's no need for another device

431
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:09,600
Speaker 4:  that plays your music or has an assistant where your TV literally should

432
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,600
Speaker 4:  be doing this in 2023. Right? So that's kind of the way we approach it. What

433
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,160
Speaker 4:  are some kind of proven low hanging fruit that have been already

434
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:19,640
Speaker 4:  validated from, from other devices that people are spending money on that

435
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,600
Speaker 4:  we can just package it all in into this one device.

436
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:26,440
Speaker 3:  Alright, we gotta take a quick break and then we will be back with more from

437
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,040
Speaker 3:  Ilio Pozin on the future of tv.

438
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:43,090
Speaker 3:  Let's pick up where we left off talking about the job of the tv.

439
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:47,010
Speaker 3:  I have to admit, I'm sort of taken by Ilya's vision for what a TV

440
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,770
Speaker 3:  could be. It's the biggest screen in your house. It lives front and center

441
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:54,610
Speaker 3:  in your home. It feels like it ought to be much more than a big blank

442
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,130
Speaker 3:  black screen most of the time. Right. But nobody's ever

443
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:02,330
Speaker 3:  really tried to do it the way he's describing. And I don't think it's because

444
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:06,290
Speaker 3:  nobody ever thought to try. Which is why I think the way Telly is

445
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:10,410
Speaker 3:  planning to sell the TV is one of the most important things about it.

446
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:14,890
Speaker 3:  So I asked Ilya how early in the process did he decide that the TV

447
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,290
Speaker 3:  was going to be free for customers?

448
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:21,410
Speaker 4:  Oh, that from the get go. Yeah. Our intention was never to go out there

449
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:25,650
Speaker 4:  and become yet another hardware company and sell a TV right away.

450
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:29,450
Speaker 4:  It was the idea is, okay, can we do the same thing that we did at PlutoTV

451
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,690
Speaker 4:  Free, free is by far the best way to market any kind of product, right?

452
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,050
Speaker 4:  Sure. And this was proven even here, like we've, in our first week of launching

453
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:41,930
Speaker 4:  in May, we had hundreds of thousands of people sign up, right? We had

454
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:45,610
Speaker 4:  to sign up every second. We, they shared their data. They, they understood

455
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,090
Speaker 4:  that their data is already being monetized by their TV makers. But here,

456
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:52,650
Speaker 4:  there's a real value exchange and they're sitting on our wait list, waiting,

457
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:56,570
Speaker 4:  waiting for, for us to deliver a tv. And, and if you look at the kind

458
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:59,410
Speaker 4:  of people that signed up and the kind of people that are signing up every

459
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:02,890
Speaker 4:  single day, they're, they're actually over index on income. They over index

460
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:06,610
Speaker 4:  on education. They're savvy. They understand that this is a better smarter

461
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:10,810
Speaker 4:  You know TV of the future. And the fact that it's free is not because

462
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,930
Speaker 4:  it's a low income, low budget TV whatsoever.

463
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:16,410
Speaker 3:  Do you think you could have made the opposite case? Like if you had come

464
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:20,290
Speaker 3:  out and said, we made this tv, it's better in every way. It's more powerful.

465
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:23,970
Speaker 3:  It, it fulfills this vision of what we think a TV can be. And also

466
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,010
Speaker 3:  it's a thousand dollars. It's it's twice the price of your like piece of

467
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:31,570
Speaker 3:  crap Roku tv, but trust that it's worth it. You don't think so?

468
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,770
Speaker 4:  They would fall on our, on our nose. It would fail because once again,

469
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:39,450
Speaker 4:  consumers are like, they're, you walk into a store, you see what's on sale

470
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:43,200
Speaker 4:  and that's what you buy. It's the, the, the driver's price, right? There's

471
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,600
Speaker 4:  a baseline of quality that you're looking for, and then the next factor of

472
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,440
Speaker 4:  how you make a decision of what, of, of purchasing a TV s price. So even

473
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,320
Speaker 4:  the idea of making the TV $50 more by adding a camera

474
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,600
Speaker 4:  to it, I don't think it would work. Okay. Right. I just, I I I think the

475
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,800
Speaker 4:  majority of consumers are, are kind of driven by what the norm is And

476
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,320
Speaker 4:  what the standard is. And I think the only way to introduce a

477
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,760
Speaker 4:  disruptive product into the market in a category where it's commoditized

478
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,000
Speaker 4:  and there's so many other players is to also disrupt a price point.

479
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:15,480
Speaker 3:  Okay. Yeah. So this really is the same as PlutoTV in that way, right? It's

480
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,160
Speaker 3:  two separate insights. This should be free and this

481
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,200
Speaker 3:  should be better that just kind of crash into each other

482
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,120
Speaker 4:  Completely. Right?

483
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,720
Speaker 3:  So what do you make of the reaction? I, I like when Telly first came out,

484
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,600
Speaker 3:  my reaction, and I think a lot of people's was

485
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:34,800
Speaker 3:  basically this is one of three things. This is either like a scam, this is

486
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,760
Speaker 3:  either a horrifying, dystopian, You know

487
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,040
Speaker 3:  surveillance nightmare that is just going to show me ads 24 hours a day,

488
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,880
Speaker 3:  or this is the future of television because this is essentially the present

489
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,120
Speaker 3:  of television and I'm just now getting it for free. Am I missing any, did

490
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,720
Speaker 3:  I, did I go through the full range of emotions? What, what other ones were

491
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,560
Speaker 3:  there? No,

492
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,240
Speaker 4:  That I think, I think obviously when you're coming out with a free product

493
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:59,720
Speaker 4:  that it's, people automatically think this is too good to be true. Right?

494
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,320
Speaker 4:  Like, what's the catch? What, what's out there? And I think they quickly

495
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,960
Speaker 4:  realize that it's actually on the flip side, that, that when you look at

496
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,200
Speaker 4:  other TV makers, they're double dipping on, on the revenue stream. They're

497
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,240
Speaker 4:  selling you a piece of hardware, they're monetizing with ads, they're selling

498
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,800
Speaker 4:  your data, right? And that's the reaction we got from

499
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,000
Speaker 4:  consumers. Like we, we've had little to no hesitation of people signing up,

500
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:24,040
Speaker 4:  right? People understood that, that there's that value exchange that, that

501
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,600
Speaker 4:  they're willing to share their data and because they're getting a thousand

502
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,400
Speaker 4:  dollars TV completely free, right? And they understood that this is a product

503
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,280
Speaker 4:  that is far superior than anything else in the market. So, and,

504
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:39,320
Speaker 4:  and that it's proven not only in our signup rate

505
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,120
Speaker 4:  and our wait list, but it's also proven in all the usage, right? Like we're,

506
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:45,680
Speaker 4:  we're in public beta right now. We're, we're in thousands and thousands of

507
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,320
Speaker 4:  homes and, and this thing is working and people are using it every single

508
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:53,280
Speaker 4:  day, right? TVs are owned for six to seven years and they're used for

509
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,160
Speaker 4:  their primary TV in a home is used for many hours per day. And when you're

510
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,120
Speaker 4:  a device in the biggest screen in your home, in the, in the, and the most

511
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,200
Speaker 4:  important device essentially in a home that's used for six, seven years,

512
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:08,200
Speaker 4:  it's not just a tv, it's a platform. Right? And that's the way we're looking

513
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,120
Speaker 4:  at it and we're building it, is let's check the box on tv. Yes, it

514
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,000
Speaker 4:  could do everything else here, TV can, but then let's start innovating

515
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,880
Speaker 4:  and pushing updates. And there's so much more we could have built from the

516
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,960
Speaker 4:  get go, but we don't wanna overwhelm the consumer like, oh, this thing could

517
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,960
Speaker 4:  do this and this and this and this. Like, it's coming, right? Like there's

518
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:28,960
Speaker 4:  like, you might come home one day and and you might see that,

519
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,680
Speaker 4:  hey, like you see a list of your, of your friends that have tellies online,

520
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,120
Speaker 4:  you might be able to like You know, Hey, David's online, let's let's watch

521
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:40,000
Speaker 4:  TV together. There's a game on, right? Or let's, let's say, Hey, hey Telly,

522
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,840
Speaker 4:  take a photo of me and send it to mom. Mom comes home, sees a photo

523
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,800
Speaker 4:  of her son, right? And pins it to the bottom screen in a, in a cute little

524
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,320
Speaker 4:  photo frame. And that lives there, right? There's so many things that, that

525
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,280
Speaker 4:  we can do with this device, but because it's free, there's no barrier entry,

526
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:58,920
Speaker 4:  right? The idea of another TV maker coming out with,

527
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:03,040
Speaker 4:  with a TV and try to do something social, it's, it's, is gonna fail because

528
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:07,320
Speaker 4:  You know if let's say you're vio you wanna build a social experience, you

529
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:11,080
Speaker 4:  have to make sure everyone else has a VIO tv. But then that's You know that's

530
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,680
Speaker 4:  not gonna happen. But if Telly is completely free, the idea that everyone

531
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:18,440
Speaker 4:  now starts having a tele and you can actually connect them and create this

532
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,400
Speaker 4:  network effect is absolutely feasible. And you'll bet that that's something

533
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,280
Speaker 4:  that we're gonna start rolling out more and more of in, in the coming months.

534
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:29,520
Speaker 3:  Okay. What do you say to the people who look at what you're offering

535
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,200
Speaker 3:  both in terms of like the ad supported stuff and the,

536
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,600
Speaker 3:  the camera and the data collection and see a total

537
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:40,920
Speaker 3:  nightmare surveillance hellscape? Are you interested in winning

538
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,920
Speaker 3:  those people over? Like what do you, how do you make that case?

539
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,320
Speaker 4:  I I look, we're, we're a privacy first company. We're a product first company,

540
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:50,960
Speaker 4:  right? So even from our ad experience, it's non-intrusive, non

541
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,120
Speaker 4:  interrupting. You're not gonna see a video ad with sound on while you're

542
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:54,640
Speaker 4:  watching tv.

543
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,840
Speaker 3:  To be fair, that's what everybody says about ads. And most people are lying

544
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,880
Speaker 3:  when they say that about ads.

545
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:02,880
Speaker 4:  That's right. And the camera is closed by default, right? Sure. When you

546
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,120
Speaker 4:  open up Zoom, we literally pop put up a message on the screen saying, would

547
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,160
Speaker 4:  you like to open up the camera to do a zoom call? The second you close the

548
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,640
Speaker 4:  zoom call, the camera closes, right? This is not the business we're in, right?

549
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:16,560
Speaker 4:  When you're looking at once again, other TV makers, they're monetizing your

550
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,040
Speaker 4:  data with very little to no permission, right? They're monetizing in many

551
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,080
Speaker 4:  different streams. We're just very upfront and transparent about it. We let

552
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,960
Speaker 4:  consumers know everything is fully opt in. Nothing is hidden in long terms

553
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,760
Speaker 4:  of service, right? You're, you're, you're there. We tell you that you're

554
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,800
Speaker 4:  opting into this, you're opting into that this is how we use your data, this

555
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,240
Speaker 4:  is how we advertise, and in exchange we're giving you a free TV and all these

556
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,560
Speaker 4:  other guys aren't, right? So I think it's a, it's a conscious decision and

557
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,360
Speaker 4:  we're seeing very little to no pushback from the consumer side of things,

558
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,360
Speaker 4:  right? And if you, even if you look at some of like, like the interview we

559
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:51,320
Speaker 4:  had in like Wall Street Journal for example, right? They did a,

560
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,200
Speaker 4:  I think the reporting was fantastic. They obviously interviewed some privacy

561
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,800
Speaker 4:  experts and they said, yeah, they could be a concern about this. But then

562
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:59,960
Speaker 4:  they interviewed consumers and said, yeah, You know what I signed up because

563
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,920
Speaker 4:  I know all these other guys that I'm paying it to for already do this and

564
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,680
Speaker 4:  they do it with my, without my permission and this case I'm getting a very

565
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,120
Speaker 4:  clear value exchange, so why not? Right? Yeah.

566
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,040
Speaker 3:  I think that is a slightly nihilist way of looking at the world. And

567
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,280
Speaker 3:  also I think absolutely true, right? And I think this is a thing we struggle

568
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,160
Speaker 3:  with a lot is like, to some extent, it's really important

569
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,800
Speaker 3:  to talk about privacy and how your data moves around the internet, And

570
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:26,760
Speaker 3:  what companies and platforms know about you And, what they can do with that

571
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,480
Speaker 3:  information, how it matters. And on the other hand, I think most people either

572
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:34,600
Speaker 3:  don't care or think it's so far gone that it's not useful to

573
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,880
Speaker 3:  think about. Like personally, I just, I struggle with that all the time.

574
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:41,560
Speaker 3:  It's like, how much does being a privacy zealot

575
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:45,840
Speaker 3:  mean anything to anyone anymore? I genuinely don't know the answer. And I

576
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,120
Speaker 3:  think part of what you just said that I think is so interesting is like,

577
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,960
Speaker 3:  you, you're basically just saying the quiet part loud, right? Like, you're

578
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,840
Speaker 3:  like, you're like, yes, we are going to make money off of the data that

579
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,760
Speaker 3:  you give us when you use our product. So is everybody else. We're just going

580
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,480
Speaker 3:  to be much louder about it. And that's right. Yeah. That's kind of, it's

581
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,560
Speaker 3:  kind of a wild approach, but I, I like, I kind of respect it, I have to say,

582
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:10,040
Speaker 4:  Well, I think transparency is key. I think when consumers get upset is

583
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,000
Speaker 4:  when something happens that was obfuscated, right? And that's when you see

584
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,960
Speaker 4:  a lot of trouble in, in any kind of iot companies is when,

585
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:21,080
Speaker 4:  when people thought one thing and another thing happens, right? And, and

586
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:24,760
Speaker 4:  for us once again, we You know we, we led this from a privacy first perspective,

587
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,560
Speaker 4:  right? If you go do focus groups, you'll, and, and if you're like a Samsung

588
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,720
Speaker 4:  and you run a focus group, should we put a camera in our tv? Right? There's

589
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,360
Speaker 4:  already such a bad reputation and there's like some negative connotation

590
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,160
Speaker 4:  about the product that most people will say no. Right? And that's what a

591
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,160
Speaker 4:  lot of focus groups are wrong from that perspective, right? Because they

592
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,800
Speaker 4:  don't actually position it the right way. But if you understood

593
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,200
Speaker 4:  the value ads that it gives you that you could do the video calls and fitness

594
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,760
Speaker 4:  and gaming and all these other things that a camera unlocks, but you make

595
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,920
Speaker 4:  people feel comfortable, right? Because the shutter's closed and because

596
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,560
Speaker 4:  you're very upfront about how you use the data and how you monetize. I think

597
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:03,360
Speaker 4:  it's a very different kind of experience and relationship that a company

598
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,680
Speaker 4:  can have with that consumer. And that's, that's how we're positioning. It's,

599
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,080
Speaker 4:  it's when it's the other way that it becomes a challenge.

600
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:13,200
Speaker 3:  Yeah. No, I think that's totally fair. And I think there is in there

601
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,960
Speaker 3:  somewhere though still a a bar you have to

602
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,920
Speaker 3:  hold on your own, right? Like, I think the, the idea that everybody's

603
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,160
Speaker 3:  gonna like read the terms of service carefully and, and fully understand

604
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,000
Speaker 3:  it and think about it and agree to it is it's just not true. Like nobody

605
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:30,680
Speaker 3:  does that. So you can come in and say like, we are much clearer about it

606
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,600
Speaker 3:  the way that this works. And I think realistically, you're, you're right

607
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:37,320
Speaker 3:  that just by virtue of the fact that the TV is free, people are going to

608
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,640
Speaker 3:  like inherently understand what the trade off is like that makes total sense

609
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,080
Speaker 3:  to me. I am curious what you think sort of your own

610
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,360
Speaker 3:  internal bar for, like you say you're, you come from a privacy first

611
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,080
Speaker 3:  perspective. Like what does that look like practically like on

612
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,000
Speaker 3:  behalf of the users who still aren't paying enough attention to really know

613
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,560
Speaker 3:  what's going on?

614
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,000
Speaker 4:  I mean, once again, I think transparency is key. I I do think there are a

615
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,720
Speaker 4:  lot of people that overlook privacy, right? And as you said, they kind of

616
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,120
Speaker 4:  just click, I agree on every terms of service and, and move forward. And

617
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,080
Speaker 4:  that whether, and, and maybe that's because they don't care maybe, or maybe

618
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:13,640
Speaker 4:  it's because they already realize that it's gone too far and everyone,

619
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:16,440
Speaker 4:  it's, it's one of those things everyone already does and they're selling

620
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,240
Speaker 4:  the data. So might as well get a You know some value exchange for it. I don't

621
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,000
Speaker 4:  really know You know, like from my perspective, I, I know that

622
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,920
Speaker 4:  there, that are a lot of software that I use and a lot of hardware that I

623
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,520
Speaker 4:  use kind of obfuscates the, the transparency around privacy. Sure.

624
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,280
Speaker 4:  They're absolutely out there selling my data, right? But I also think

625
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,840
Speaker 4:  there are a lot of laws and regulations in place,

626
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:42,200
Speaker 4:  truthfully, that make sure that if your data is sold,

627
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:46,200
Speaker 4:  it's anonymized and those things are absolutely real. Like, and anyone who

628
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,520
Speaker 4:  violates those laws should not exist, right? So first and foremost, you gotta

629
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,040
Speaker 4:  stay above every state and federal law. Like that bar is already there. So

630
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,480
Speaker 4:  even anytime we have any kind of data, it's, it's anonymous, right? We're,

631
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:00,240
Speaker 4:  we're not attaching any personal level level data to any ad targeting data.

632
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,400
Speaker 4:  And that's how you have to operate a business. Like I've been in the ad world

633
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:07,360
Speaker 4:  on both the buy side when I had an agency to, to the sell side when I had

634
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:11,120
Speaker 4:  PlutoTV, right? To now with Telly, that is extremely important. You,

635
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:14,600
Speaker 4:  you have to protect people's data and you have to build

636
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,200
Speaker 4:  environments that enable those levels of protection. Those actually already

637
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:21,520
Speaker 4:  exist, right? Even if you're working with servers and services like Amazon,

638
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,920
Speaker 4:  they're built in to be able to You know, have that level of data protection.

639
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,760
Speaker 4:  So that's kinda my view. I think there's, there's a few people that are really

640
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:33,360
Speaker 4:  vocal, if you will, on privacy and data, but what

641
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,320
Speaker 4:  are they gonna do? Like, like is there a TV that you can go out there and

642
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,040
Speaker 4:  purchase that doesn't sell your data, that doesn't deliver advertising? Like

643
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:43,840
Speaker 4:  what are your options? Or do you just get You know no TV at all and

644
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:48,200
Speaker 4:  You know run everything behind A V P N or I, I You know, I

645
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,920
Speaker 4:  I think you can complain all day or you can realize that people need to run

646
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,240
Speaker 4:  their businesses so they need access to, to data. And at the end of the day,

647
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,840
Speaker 4:  advertisers want to target homes effectively. Like so, right? So for,

648
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:03,800
Speaker 4:  for us, for example, we ask you at signup, what car do you own You

649
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,640
Speaker 4:  know? Are you in the market for a new car in the next six months? If you

650
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,280
Speaker 4:  are an advertiser wants to know that, but frankly you want to know that as

651
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,680
Speaker 4:  a consumer too, right? Because you wanna start seeing relevant

652
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,880
Speaker 4:  advertising for things that you have intent to buy, right? But if you

653
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:21,920
Speaker 4:  block all your data, cover your data, now you're seeing ads for You know

654
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:24,920
Speaker 4:  stuff that doesn't even important. And that's where I think that's where

655
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,760
Speaker 4:  people start having a negative association Advertising is when ads aren't

656
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,120
Speaker 4:  relevant, right? And it feels like it's benefiting, benefiting one side and

657
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,920
Speaker 4:  not the other side. We've built our whole business to make sure that

658
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:39,720
Speaker 4:  that benefit. It goes two ways, right? That, that you, you're getting ads

659
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,040
Speaker 4:  that are relevant and advertisers are, are, are advertising to you because

660
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,000
Speaker 4:  they know that you need this product.

661
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:51,520
Speaker 3:  Okay, we gotta take one more break and then we will be back with more from

662
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:55,560
Speaker 3:  Ilya Pozin on Telly, PlutoTV TVs and

663
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,040
Speaker 3:  lots more

664
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:54,020
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Right? And it's like, I think we have hit that threshold in a really

665
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:57,260
Speaker 3:  real way. And I think your timing is super interesting as a result because

666
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:00,820
Speaker 3:  what you're doing is you're not just saying, we're gonna make one part of

667
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:04,060
Speaker 3:  this cheaper for you. You're like, let's just blow the whole thing up, top

668
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:07,620
Speaker 3:  down and start over. Like, yeah, it's gonna be super

669
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:11,580
Speaker 3:  interesting to see kind of how far that goes because I think like Avo is

670
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,140
Speaker 3:  having a moment right now, right? Like PlutoTV is growing really fast, Tubi

671
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:17,260
Speaker 3:  is growing really fast. We're in this place where people are looking for

672
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:20,500
Speaker 3:  a way to make things less expensive and they will happily watch some ads

673
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,740
Speaker 3:  in order to do so. I absolutely think you're right about that. How far that

674
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:26,460
Speaker 3:  goes I think is really interesting. And I think that goes back to the question

675
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,860
Speaker 3:  of the reaction to Telly and like how you think about the product itself.

676
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:33,260
Speaker 3:  Because I think what a lot of people are reacting to is the idea that the

677
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:37,020
Speaker 3:  second screen is basically going to be an always on billboard showing

678
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,500
Speaker 3:  me ads. And from the way you're describing the product, it doesn't sound

679
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,940
Speaker 3:  like that's the case. My initial impression is certainly like, it's just

680
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:48,020
Speaker 3:  gonna be a a, a scrolling ticker of ads as long as my TV

681
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,980
Speaker 3:  is on. And that just sounds like a crummy user experience in a lot of

682
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:55,580
Speaker 3:  ways. Is it not that, like how do you, how do you avoid it's not being

683
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,380
Speaker 3:  so bad at ads that people hate it even though they like the trade? Yeah,

684
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:02,980
Speaker 4:  That's a great question. It's not that whatsoever, right? The majority of

685
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:06,900
Speaker 4:  the screen is dedicated to widgets and content that

686
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,980
Speaker 4:  actually is standalone amazing and then enhances what you're viewing, right?

687
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,940
Speaker 4:  So we've got like things like, like time and weather and

688
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:18,940
Speaker 4:  a news sticker and sports scores, right? Stocks, right? Things that are

689
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:22,220
Speaker 4:  very relevant and people are buying. You know they have assistance now from

690
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:26,140
Speaker 4:  Google and Amazon that have a lot of visual additives, not just You

691
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:29,060
Speaker 4:  know, not just your voice assistant with a speaker, but they're actually

692
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:32,880
Speaker 4:  showing you a lot of useful information. So that's built in and th and

693
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,840
Speaker 4:  that's like 75, 80% of the screen is dedicated to that,

694
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:40,760
Speaker 4:  right? And then because we understand what you're watching on the main

695
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:44,280
Speaker 4:  screen, we're able to automatically adjust those widgets based on what you're

696
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,960
Speaker 4:  watching. So if you turn on a movie, we show you accurate information, right?

697
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:51,760
Speaker 4:  We show you You know description of the movie, maybe some trivia, some fun

698
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,760
Speaker 4:  things to enhance that movie. You're gonna look at your phone anyway Sure

699
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,480
Speaker 4:  for that, right? And we're we're saying let's put that front and center.

700
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,000
Speaker 4:  The best way to look at it's, it's the bottom screen is almost like an iPad

701
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,720
Speaker 4:  attached to the tv. Once again, you're, you're, you've got your family in

702
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,160
Speaker 4:  front of this big device. Everyone's looking at their phones for different

703
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,360
Speaker 4:  reasons. You're watching a sports game, you wanna know how the other teams

704
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:15,320
Speaker 4:  are doing. Maybe maybe your fantasy, maybe your fantasy team. You wanna

705
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,320
Speaker 4:  look at the stats, why not put that front and center right? And maybe sports

706
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,600
Speaker 4:  betting, right? Why not have Fando or DraftKings integration right there

707
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,480
Speaker 4:  natively. The ad is a small part of, of that, of

708
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,360
Speaker 4:  that screen, right? It's, it's not there to distract you. It's

709
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,920
Speaker 4:  there to obviously You know support this value exchange of being free and

710
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,440
Speaker 4:  to connect with a consumer in a very transparent way. But it's not the majority

711
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,360
Speaker 4:  of the screen whatsoever. In fact, once you use You know tele, this is,

712
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,000
Speaker 4:  this is across the board and you can look at our data and look at any customer

713
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,600
Speaker 4:  feedback is, is people love it and it's very hard for them to go back to

714
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,280
Speaker 4:  a single stream screen and they'll, they'll, they'll tell you that it's not

715
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:54,280
Speaker 4:  a distraction. We haven't had a single consumer switch out of a

716
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,120
Speaker 4:  tele and go back to a device that doesn't have that bottom screen. 'cause

717
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,480
Speaker 4:  they're not looking at it in a negative way.

718
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,000
Speaker 3:  Interesting. Okay. Have you tested to see like, how many ads is too

719
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,720
Speaker 3:  many ads? I would, I would think that would be a really interesting experiment

720
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,720
Speaker 3:  to run. Have you done that?

721
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:09,920
Speaker 4:  Yeah. There's, that's still data we're, we're looking at every single day,

722
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,160
Speaker 4:  right? Like our, and we've built a You know a rockstar team like our head

723
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:17,000
Speaker 4:  of product. Sasha was the head of product that Android TV for You know

724
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,960
Speaker 4:  for Google. He's running our product here and, and You know the same thing

725
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,000
Speaker 4:  across the board and the ads and everything else. We've got just the right

726
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,560
Speaker 4:  team that has industry experience and startup chops to make this work. And

727
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,280
Speaker 4:  we're You know if you notice You know we're in a beta program. What TV

728
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,720
Speaker 4:  company goes into a beta program, right? Sure. Like Google launches, Gmail

729
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:36,520
Speaker 4:  and beta or whatever new product. That's the way, that's the way software

730
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:40,120
Speaker 4:  is done even by bigger companies. That's unheard of From a hardware perspective,

731
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:44,080
Speaker 4:  and this is kind of going back to like my, my Roots. I'm a, I'm, I've been

732
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:47,760
Speaker 4:  a software guy my, my entire life. We're very much running this

733
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:51,280
Speaker 4:  like a software company and we're very transparent. We, we've been in private

734
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:55,240
Speaker 4:  beta where we tested this with You know CLO close family and friends just

735
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,840
Speaker 4:  to You know, make sure we've got like TV 1 0 1 and the core product done

736
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:02,480
Speaker 4:  and stable. And then we opened up to public beta for people that we don't

737
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,280
Speaker 4:  have a relationship with, but that agreed to kind of go on this journey with

738
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,640
Speaker 4:  us and to kind of shape the future of TV and make this product better. And

739
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,520
Speaker 4:  they're giving us feedback and they're sharing their data and they're telling

740
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:15,520
Speaker 4:  us how to make this better and improve it. And it's working like the data

741
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:19,600
Speaker 4:  is there. People are using this every single day. In fact,

742
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,880
Speaker 4:  even our original business model of how many hours per day people will use

743
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,840
Speaker 4:  this, we, we were wrong by almost half. Wow. You

744
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:30,560
Speaker 4:  know. So, so it's, it's working right? And people have multiple TVs in their

745
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,800
Speaker 4:  house. We wanna make sure that this is their primary TV and not get stuck

746
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:37,760
Speaker 4:  in a, a basement somewhere. One way to solve that is to make it the right

747
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,320
Speaker 4:  size. Right. The average American family has a 49 inch tv, so we made a

748
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:45,120
Speaker 4:  55. Right? So naturally it's gonna go in a, in a main room, but

749
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:48,480
Speaker 4:  also people could just shove it in a, in a guest room or somewhere else,

750
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,720
Speaker 4:  but they're not Right. And the data shows based on, based on how often they're

751
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,080
Speaker 4:  watching it.

752
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:55,360
Speaker 3:  Yeah. What happens if they do. I mean, I think part of what's been interesting

753
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:59,240
Speaker 3:  about tele is trying to figure out how to make sure people

754
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:03,280
Speaker 3:  use the product in a way that works without being scary. And you have

755
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,240
Speaker 3:  some scary sounding rules about like You know what you can and can't do to

756
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:11,160
Speaker 3:  the TV without violating the terms of service. Like what balance

757
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,880
Speaker 3:  have you found there where you're like, we, we need you to use your TV in

758
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,960
Speaker 3:  a certain way for this business to make sense for us, but we also want it

759
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,920
Speaker 3:  to feel like a thing that you own that isn't just like a box that

760
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,600
Speaker 3:  we've put into your house that we can take back at any time. Do You know

761
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:23,880
Speaker 3:  what I mean?

762
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:27,760
Speaker 4:  Yeah, yeah. No, I think that's a great question too. I look, we, we want

763
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,400
Speaker 4:  to have a positive, transparent relationship with our consumers and we don't

764
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,000
Speaker 4:  want consumers that fraud us. Right? We don't want consumers that You know

765
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:38,200
Speaker 4:  tell us they're gonna do one thing and then do another thing. Because that's,

766
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:41,320
Speaker 4:  we're we're trying to be successful as a company and, and if you have a bunch

767
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:44,760
Speaker 4:  of fraudulent consumers that take advantage of you, we're it, it's not gonna

768
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:48,720
Speaker 4:  be good for business. Right? So, so for us, we put policies in

769
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,400
Speaker 4:  place, You know to be able to have that opportunity to,

770
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:55,920
Speaker 4:  in, in case someone is frauding us to be able to take the device back and

771
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,480
Speaker 4:  saying like, look, you're covering up the bottom screen or you're not using

772
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,120
Speaker 4:  this in the main room. Right? But first and foremost, we want to build the

773
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,000
Speaker 4:  right experience. You can't even cover up the bottom screen. Right? All of

774
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,800
Speaker 4:  your settings, your volume controls, your H D M I switching, everything

775
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,880
Speaker 4:  happens on the bottom. Sure. Right? So we actually cleaned up the top to

776
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,000
Speaker 4:  make it to easier to watch in the bottom. Actually, that's where your control

777
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,560
Speaker 4:  center is for your whole device. And frankly, you don't want to cover it

778
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,240
Speaker 4:  up 'cause that's where you're playing your music, that's where you're doing

779
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,760
Speaker 4:  your Zoom calls, right? That's where your ring doorbell appears. That's where

780
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,240
Speaker 4:  you're getting like news and weather. It's work. So first and foremost, you

781
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,920
Speaker 4:  build a good product that people don't want to fraud, right? Sure. I think

782
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:32,760
Speaker 4:  that's a prerequisite. If we built a product that is

783
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,000
Speaker 4:  there just for our sake from a business perspective that's there to monetize

784
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,160
Speaker 4:  and make ads and we don't, and that bottom screen doesn't actually provide

785
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:42,920
Speaker 4:  any actually valuable in inventory, then of course people are naturally gonna

786
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,680
Speaker 4:  say, okay, I'm just gonna get this. I'm gonna tell 'em I'm gonna do that.

787
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:49,000
Speaker 4:  I'm gonna do something else 'cause I just want a free 55 inch tv. But then

788
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,600
Speaker 4:  we failed from a product perspective. Right? Right. And, and that's first

789
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:56,360
Speaker 4:  and foremost what, what our approach is, is let's build a killer product

790
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:59,720
Speaker 4:  that people don't actually wanna keep as their main tv. 'cause it's better.

791
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:02,600
Speaker 4:  Right. And if that's where you're playing your music and that's where you're

792
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,800
Speaker 4:  doing your Zoom calls and everything else, why would you put that in a guest

793
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:09,560
Speaker 4:  bedroom? Then your primary TV in your living room is now not as

794
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,840
Speaker 4:  powerful. Right? Sure. And I think that's the way we do it. And of course

795
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:16,040
Speaker 4:  we put things in place to give us the ability to

796
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:19,400
Speaker 4:  You know, take the TV back and things like that for people that fought it.

797
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:22,400
Speaker 4:  But we're not seeing that, like we're seeing everyone use it in the right

798
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,200
Speaker 4:  way, at least so far.

799
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:26,080
Speaker 3:  Yeah. I mean it's, I I'm not surprised they had a beta test, right? Like

800
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,290
Speaker 3:  you have a self-selecting group group of people who are likely to use it.

801
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:32,000
Speaker 3:  But I guess the, the sort of extreme example would be like the idea that

802
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:35,720
Speaker 3:  I could go on vacation for two months and come home and my TV has been

803
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,240
Speaker 3:  repoed,

804
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:39,160
Speaker 4:  That wouldn't happen. We would never do that. We would never do that. And

805
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:42,640
Speaker 4:  we don't have policies in place to do that. We, that's, that's just not realistic

806
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,280
Speaker 4:  whatsoever.

807
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:47,000
Speaker 3:  Okay, fair enough. Yeah. So the, all the software you've mentioned, all the

808
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,800
Speaker 3:  stuff you're thinking about building, you mentioned You know, doing integrations

809
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,520
Speaker 3:  and all that stuff. What's your sense over time of how much of this you are

810
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:57,200
Speaker 3:  gonna try and build versus like opening a

811
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,840
Speaker 3:  platform? Like is is the tele app store gonna be a thing? Like you wanna

812
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:04,760
Speaker 3:  build this giant corpus of stuff onto a big screen, right? Yeah. What's

813
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,320
Speaker 3:  your sense of how much of that you need to do yourself?

814
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:09,720
Speaker 4:  Yeah, no, that's a great question. So initially we're doing it ourselves.

815
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:13,720
Speaker 4:  We we are built on, on Android, right? Sure. Which, which gives us a

816
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:17,280
Speaker 4:  huge advantage and a big existing ecosystem, right? And similar to Amazon

817
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,680
Speaker 4:  Fire tv, which is built on, on Android as well, right? It gives you an advantage

818
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:24,400
Speaker 4:  because you can, you can use existing apps. Like when we, when we put

819
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,280
Speaker 4:  Spotify into the, into Telly, there was pretty much no work, right?

820
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,320
Speaker 4:  'cause Spotify already had an Android TV app, so we just poured it over,

821
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,760
Speaker 4:  right? And those things give you an advantage as a startup, but also, and

822
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:38,360
Speaker 4:  potentially in the future, allow us to open up the app store and create

823
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:42,240
Speaker 4:  experiences that go beyond streaming. And, and that, I think that's the key

824
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,160
Speaker 4:  phrase here is beyond streaming, right? And if we

825
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,320
Speaker 4:  do open up an app store, it'll still be on an approval basis of course, that

826
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,840
Speaker 4:  we bring anything in is we don't want yet again, another kind of

827
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,440
Speaker 4:  congested environment where there's like hundreds of apps and only five of

828
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,240
Speaker 4:  them are good. But more importantly, we want people to build for tele

829
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:02,800
Speaker 4:  things that they wouldn't normally build for another TV maker, because it's

830
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,760
Speaker 4:  impossible to get that from another TV maker because maybe they don't have

831
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,840
Speaker 4:  a microphone, they don't have a camera, they don't have a second screen,

832
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,840
Speaker 4:  they don't have great speakers, they don't have this computing power, right?

833
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:16,200
Speaker 4:  Our remote You know it's got a, it's got a microphone's, got some sensors

834
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,160
Speaker 4:  in it that'll also enable things in the future. Imagine this thing becoming

835
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,520
Speaker 4:  a karaoke machine in a couple months where You know words appear on the top

836
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:26,600
Speaker 4:  songs in the bottom, you pick up your remote, this has a mic, right? Or a

837
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:30,520
Speaker 4:  gaming pad or whatever it is, right? So, so initially we're gonna kind

838
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:34,400
Speaker 4:  of create these examples of different use cases that show how we can

839
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,120
Speaker 4:  go beyond a normal television of what you're used to for the last 20, 30

840
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,920
Speaker 4:  years. And then eventually we'd love to open it up to those

841
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,160
Speaker 4:  that want to build for it. But once again, to go, we don't want just another

842
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:49,400
Speaker 4:  fast service to appear on this thing, right? Like there's, there's plenty

843
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:53,320
Speaker 4:  of those. We, we really want to take this thing and to become the main

844
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:57,120
Speaker 4:  device in a home, just like your, your iPhone or your your Android

845
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,520
Speaker 4:  phone is, is the, is the main device outta your home.

846
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:02,880
Speaker 3:  What kind of appetite do you think there is in, in the world for folks who

847
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,600
Speaker 3:  wanna build that kind of stuff? I just think about like, it, it feels like

848
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:09,360
Speaker 3:  every three years Apple tells a story about the Apple TV being like an amazing

849
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:13,280
Speaker 3:  game console and it, it just isn't true. Like people don't

850
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:17,200
Speaker 3:  play games on their Apple tv. That's just like not a thing. But Apple

851
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,760
Speaker 3:  desperately wants people to, and there's also, I I think like you talk about

852
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,520
Speaker 3:  with the smart TV platforms, we've gone on this race to the bottom where

853
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,760
Speaker 3:  all the apps are bad. Everybody has just given up on doing interesting stuff

854
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,080
Speaker 3:  because it's pure commodity and it sucks and nobody caress anymore.

855
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:34,280
Speaker 3:  Can you get to the point where you're big enough and cool enough and exciting

856
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,800
Speaker 3:  enough that you think you can like win back some of these people who have

857
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,360
Speaker 3:  been burned by building TV stuff before?

858
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:42,280
Speaker 4:  I think you'll be surprised we're already seeing it, right? Not just from

859
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:46,280
Speaker 4:  individual like kind of developers, but major, major

860
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:50,680
Speaker 4:  companies who have already built platforms for tv, right?

861
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:54,440
Speaker 4:  Or second screen experiences for TV that are

862
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:58,880
Speaker 4:  so behind what we're doing and and blown away by our You know two screen

863
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:02,880
Speaker 4:  form factor that even though we're not yet at millions

864
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,800
Speaker 4:  of homes wanna build for us right now, right? Whether that's

865
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:10,920
Speaker 4:  You know sports betting, which has a natural environment or You know

866
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,680
Speaker 4:  there, there are a number of startups that you may have seen that are trying

867
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,240
Speaker 4:  to enable You know shopping on, like you're watching your favorite

868
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:21,320
Speaker 4:  show and you want to buy that, that sweatshirt, right? Like the famous You

869
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:25,000
Speaker 4:  know friend sweatshirt episode. But You know they've built second

870
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,880
Speaker 4:  screen experiences, but they're struggling because getting a consumer to

871
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,400
Speaker 4:  take out their phone or their tablet while you're watching TV is a huge hurdle,

872
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:35,600
Speaker 4:  right? But they wanna build for our, our bottom screen experience because

873
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,760
Speaker 4:  it's right there front and center, right? It's almost like a dual second

874
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:42,520
Speaker 4:  screen experie put on the main screen. And even knowing kind of our

875
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:46,200
Speaker 4:  stage and where we are, they're very interested and a lot of 'em are already

876
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,840
Speaker 4:  building for us. So you'll start seeing a lot of these partnerships that

877
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,800
Speaker 4:  I can't yet speak to will will be front and center and the

878
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:57,000
Speaker 4:  developer feedback is there without us even soliciting it.

879
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:01,720
Speaker 3:  I would think that building a future-proof TV is really important

880
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:05,400
Speaker 3:  and also really challenging. Like I, I have this Roku TV behind me that I

881
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,520
Speaker 3:  swear to God gets slower every day because the apps update and new things

882
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,480
Speaker 3:  come in and the processor just can't hang, like you were saying, six or

883
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,120
Speaker 3:  seven years, people are gonna keep these, these are not devices you upgrade

884
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,760
Speaker 3:  frequently. People I think would like to keep most of 'em even longer. Is

885
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:22,520
Speaker 3:  it, as hard as I would think to build something like what

886
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:26,480
Speaker 3:  Telly wants to be six or seven years from now is so ambitious and so big

887
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:30,560
Speaker 3:  that like you kind of have to build a TV that works now and can get all the

888
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,760
Speaker 3:  way there. I just think from a hardware perspective, that seems like it would

889
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,240
Speaker 3:  be hard to do.

890
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:36,600
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I mean, I think that's a great question. When, when, if you're a TV

891
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,320
Speaker 4:  maker and you're optimizing for the tiny margin that you make on hardware,

892
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:44,040
Speaker 4:  you're not buying the best and fastest processor. Sure.

893
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:45,240
Speaker 4:  But we are,

894
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,200
Speaker 3:  You're buying the worst one you can find,

895
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:51,360
Speaker 4:  Right? So, so because of that, you kind of have this natural obsolete, if

896
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:54,720
Speaker 4:  you will, where like, like I mentioned earlier, even building PlutoTV for

897
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:58,680
Speaker 4:  the most modern TV now is not, it's a PlutoTV is a very heavy app. It's not,

898
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,680
Speaker 4:  it's not easy. And You know if you're building an app for Roku, they're running

899
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,320
Speaker 4:  like almost like a, like a digital billboard script to, to be able to develop

900
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:08,480
Speaker 4:  for, it's very challenging for us. We're treating this like a computer, the

901
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,000
Speaker 4:  power inside of the device and the sensors that we've put in, some of them

902
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,920
Speaker 4:  aren't utilized right to its full effect now because we want

903
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,280
Speaker 4:  to enable that, that future utilization in the future. And we even added

904
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:23,240
Speaker 4:  a bunch of expansion ports on the device. So let's say say

905
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:27,400
Speaker 4:  later we want to add like a temperature sensor. So for whatever reason, like

906
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,600
Speaker 4:  let's say you want this thing to know what temperature's in your home and,

907
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:34,560
Speaker 4:  and be a thermostat. I'm, I'm making completely making it up. We've put

908
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:38,600
Speaker 4:  expansion ports on there so that you can expand the TV in other means, but

909
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:42,440
Speaker 4:  we're very much treating it like a Tesla, right? Where I'm on my third Tesla,

910
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:46,000
Speaker 4:  even in the beginning, a lot of the autopilot hardware wasn't really enabled.

911
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:49,920
Speaker 4:  And, and, and then how like delighted are we s Tesla customers where we get

912
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,680
Speaker 4:  in the car, we turn it on and we, and we see like, hey, we updated your car

913
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,240
Speaker 4:  and here's all the new stuff it can do. Like, that's awesome, right? And,

914
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:00,680
Speaker 4:  and that's the way we're treating our software updates is it's not about

915
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:04,480
Speaker 4:  fixing bugs and issues, it's about making this thing better

916
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,240
Speaker 4:  and better and better. And the only way to do that is if you overload your,

917
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:11,680
Speaker 4:  your device with extra computing power processors, memory

918
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:15,520
Speaker 4:  storage, connectivity, and then you allow it to expand into

919
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:19,160
Speaker 4:  additional sensors beyond potentially what you loaded in. Because You know

920
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:22,160
Speaker 4:  you can't get everything right out the get go. So we're, we believe we built

921
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:26,120
Speaker 4:  a very much a future-proof device. We don't want to get get you

922
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:29,520
Speaker 4:  into a new TV in two, three years like the other makers do. And I think that's

923
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,200
Speaker 4:  the other big difference is if you look at a, the makeup of like the engineering

924
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,480
Speaker 4:  team at any other TV company, the majority of them are

925
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,200
Speaker 4:  supporting old models of TVs and building new models of TVs,

926
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:43,720
Speaker 4:  right? Because TVs like, there's so many models of every other TV maker,

927
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:47,640
Speaker 4:  we've got one, right? So we, we put this out and the whole team

928
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:51,320
Speaker 4:  is focused on making this one better. And I think when you have that and

929
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:54,560
Speaker 4:  when you're concentrating your team on improving the product rather than

930
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:58,480
Speaker 4:  supporting legacy or building the next, you come out with a product at the

931
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,400
Speaker 4:  end of the day that's far superior and continues to grow as, as people

932
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:03,800
Speaker 4:  and and consumers evolve.

933
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:07,360
Speaker 3:  It would also be terrible business for you. Right? If you had to ship me

934
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,760
Speaker 3:  a new free TV every two years just to keep using tele. Yeah.

935
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,080
Speaker 4:  Horrible. Yeah. It's not the way to do it If

936
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:16,880
Speaker 3:  This works, like if this hits, this really takes off, this becomes you, you

937
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,560
Speaker 3:  become like a real huge player in the TV business. Do you think others

938
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:24,040
Speaker 3:  will start to follow, like play this sort of same game, start giving people

939
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:27,520
Speaker 3:  substantially cheaper or even free TVs in exchange for some of this other

940
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,680
Speaker 3:  stuff? Like do you think others can come after you that way? Potentially,

941
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,680
Speaker 4:  Potentially. You know, you never know how the market's gonna change. We've

942
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,280
Speaker 4:  got a lot of You know patents that we filed on, on, on what we've done and,

943
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:41,200
Speaker 4:  and we're also set up in a way where we can enable these partners with

944
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,240
Speaker 4:  us to be You know successful. So You know we're happy to work with others

945
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:47,520
Speaker 4:  and we've actually been in communication with some as well on, on these kind

946
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,240
Speaker 4:  of things. So I think it's quite possible. I think for a, a

947
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:55,280
Speaker 4:  very well-known TV maker to go out there and all of a sudden cut their

948
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,680
Speaker 4:  prices to zero and cannibalize their core business would be

949
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:03,280
Speaker 4:  probably detrimental to their stocks and probably, yeah. And You know not

950
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,880
Speaker 4:  good for their business, but it You know you. Who knows? I think a lot of

951
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,800
Speaker 4:  people are waiting and seeing what, what happens to us, which obviously

952
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:14,680
Speaker 4:  also gives us a big advantage, right? Startups move quickly. That's the one

953
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:18,520
Speaker 4:  advantage that, that we have over every big company. We don't deal

954
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:22,200
Speaker 4:  with the bureaucracy and the politics. We're, we're a small, nimble team

955
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:26,080
Speaker 4:  and speed is our only advantage. It's not, it's not our pocketbooks, right?

956
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:30,000
Speaker 4:  We're not gonna outspend a big company, but we're gonna outs speed 'em,

957
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,760
Speaker 4:  we're gonna outperform 'em and that's exactly what we're doing. And by the

958
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:35,760
Speaker 4:  time they're You know the others realize that hey, this is working and this

959
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,400
Speaker 4:  is something we need to do. We'll be years ahead like PlutoTV, right? Where

960
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:43,560
Speaker 4:  we're still by Pluto's by far in the leading company in the space.

961
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:47,400
Speaker 4:  We had a head start. We maintained that head start through just great execution.

962
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:49,960
Speaker 3:  Fair enough. All, right? I could talk to you about this forever. I find this

963
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:52,160
Speaker 3:  totally fascinating, but I should let you go. I know I've kept you a long

964
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,640
Speaker 3:  time. Thank you for doing this. This was incredibly fun. Appreciate

965
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,040
Speaker 4:  It. Thanks Eric.

966
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:01,280
Speaker 3:  Alright, that's it for The Vergecast today. Thank you so much to Ilya for

967
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,360
Speaker 3:  being on the show, and thank you as always for listening. Like I said, we

968
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:07,160
Speaker 3:  have three more episodes to come in this series. We're gonna be looking at

969
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:11,040
Speaker 3:  connectivity from all different angles. It's gonna be really fun. This show
