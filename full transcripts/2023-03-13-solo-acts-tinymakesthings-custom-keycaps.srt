00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,800
Speaker 3:  a maker and dreamer. She, that's how she describes herself. She's an

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,520
Speaker 3:  artisan key cap creator, which means she makes really,

17
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,640
Speaker 3:  really adorable key caps for your mechanical

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,000
Speaker 3:  keyboard.

19
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:58,840
Speaker 2:  I love it.

20
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,960
Speaker 3:  Now you are, you're an in, you are like a mechanical keyboard

21
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,200
Speaker 3:  enthusiast.

22
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,080
Speaker 2:  Oh yeah. I have been in this space since like, ooh 20

23
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,200
Speaker 2:  2009 actually. That was my first big mechanical keyboard. It

24
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,080
Speaker 2:  had Alps, keys, bass, kind of on like an Apple keyboard from

25
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,080
Speaker 2:  the nineties. I spent way too much money on it. I still have it.

26
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,080
Speaker 3:  Are you able to discern like a musician can hear a note? Are you able

27
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,280
Speaker 3:  to discern an MX Cherry from a a I

28
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,920
Speaker 2:  Can hear a tore. I can hear that cuz that's the key that like makes my heart

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,040
Speaker 2:  sing. But I was very excited to hear you were talking to Tiny Makes Things

30
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,840
Speaker 2:  because like the little novelly key caps. Oh my god, I love 'em. They're

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,160
Speaker 2:  so cute.

32
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:40,280
Speaker 3:  Yeah, she has got some really adorable key caps.

33
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,960
Speaker 3:  One of my favorite things that she has ever made is an

34
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,520
Speaker 3:  entire keyboard full of open mouthed Kirby.

35
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,240
Speaker 3:  Yes.

36
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,080
Speaker 2:  Just,

37
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,480
Speaker 3:  Which are extremely adorable. And she is a

38
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,120
Speaker 3:  content creator as well. So part of her early career

39
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,120
Speaker 3:  was spent on Twitch making Keycaps and talking about her process

40
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,840
Speaker 3:  and, and building a community there. She also does, I mean she does hand

41
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,080
Speaker 3:  sculpted Clay Keycaps and then she also works with resin.

42
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,680
Speaker 3:  She makes accessories. I mean it's really, it's really impressive stuff and

43
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,040
Speaker 3:  also just outrageously adorable.

44
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,800
Speaker 2:  Well I know our listeners have had to hear me talk about mechanical

45
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,080
Speaker 2:  keyboards a whole, whole lot and I'm super jealous that you got to go

46
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,040
Speaker 2:  and chat with Tiny Makes Things. So let's just like, let's get to this interview.

47
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,960
Speaker 2:  I wanna hear everything you guys learned.

48
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,360
Speaker 3:  She's terribly fascinating. I love talking to her. Let's do it

49
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,320
Speaker 3:  tiny. Thank you so much for coming and talking to me today.

50
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,160
Speaker 4:  Thank you for, for having me Ashley. Really, really happy to be

51
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,800
Speaker 3:  Here. I wanna talk about Tiny Makes things. Can you give

52
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,200
Speaker 3:  listeners just a brief overview of your work?

53
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,280
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I just love making keycaps that are silly, funny,

54
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,920
Speaker 4:  cute and just bring joy to you when you like see it on

55
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,680
Speaker 4:  your keyboard. I basically just started out just making things

56
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,320
Speaker 4:  that people, doing commissions, like making keycaps that people would ask

57
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,800
Speaker 4:  me to make of them. I kind of draw a lot of inspiration in general from

58
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,560
Speaker 4:  pop culture, like things that are trending, like memes,

59
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,720
Speaker 4:  anything that I just find funny or entertaining. Mechanical

60
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,840
Speaker 4:  keyboards back maybe, you know, six years ago or so, a lot of it was

61
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,800
Speaker 4:  just the gamer aesthetic of mechanical keyboards. A lot of the darker

62
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,480
Speaker 4:  like black colors with rgb, when people thought about mechanical

63
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,920
Speaker 4:  keyboards they thought about oh it's like for gamers and it's a certain kind

64
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,120
Speaker 4:  of look and I just, I felt like that wasn't true and being part of

65
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,680
Speaker 4:  the mechanical keyboard hobby, I knew that there was a lot more to it. And

66
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,520
Speaker 4:  so doing keycaps and making kind of fun little keycaps was my way of

67
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,400
Speaker 4:  sharing and trying to get people to understand that

68
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,680
Speaker 4:  like, yeah, mechanical keyboards can be for everybody.

69
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,600
Speaker 3:  How and when did you originally get into mechanical

70
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,880
Speaker 3:  keyboards? As a hobby?

71
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,880
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it was maybe like seven years now. I was just in college and I had

72
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,800
Speaker 4:  built my first PC to, you know, play video games on and then

73
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,920
Speaker 4:  the keyboard component actually just, I just went and bought like a $15 keyboard.

74
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,600
Speaker 4:  It was not mechanical because back then I think the only, like the cheapest

75
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,360
Speaker 4:  mechanical keyboard that you could get was something like 80 to a hundred

76
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,080
Speaker 4:  dollars. And I was like, why would I spend so much more money on a keyboard?

77
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:27,200
Speaker 4:  I don't really see the, the need for it. And I think it wasn't until a

78
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,520
Speaker 4:  little bit later that year that I, it was because I had this crush on this

79
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,320
Speaker 4:  boy and I knew that he was into keyboards and it was a very small hobby

80
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,520
Speaker 4:  back then. I was like, oh, you know, maybe I just, I just used that as an

81
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,480
Speaker 4:  excuse to like talk to him and so I was like, Hey, can you tell me about

82
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,280
Speaker 4:  keyboards? I'm thinking about getting a mechanical keyboard. And I

83
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,840
Speaker 4:  basically just, I kind of used it as an excuse but I definitely got

84
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,720
Speaker 4:  actually interested in it and I learned a lot about it. For me it was just

85
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,520
Speaker 4:  learning about like, oh, you know, like it does really make a big difference

86
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,160
Speaker 4:  how it sounds, how it feels and the typing experience and it being something

87
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,080
Speaker 4:  that you use so often like every day in your life. It

88
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,960
Speaker 4:  feels like it's kind of just a, a good investment to make, to have

89
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,000
Speaker 4:  something custom and that feels good whenever you use it.

90
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,280
Speaker 3:  What do you think it is about mechanical keyboards that sort of

91
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,120
Speaker 3:  capture people's imagination? Because there is so much creativity

92
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,280
Speaker 3:  in this space and I mean your work and the work of others.

93
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,960
Speaker 3:  I've just seen some stunning keyboards just by

94
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,720
Speaker 3:  themselves independent of custom key cap work. Yeah. Which is its own

95
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,080
Speaker 3:  its own separate community of makers. What do you think

96
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,960
Speaker 3:  it is about mechanical keyboards that really just captures all

97
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,920
Speaker 3:  of our nerdy little hearts? I

98
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,880
Speaker 4:  Think it, it's so customizable that it appeals to people in different

99
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,720
Speaker 4:  ways. Some people are really, really into just, for example

100
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,680
Speaker 4:  the, the key cap collecting part of this hobby, which is some people

101
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,480
Speaker 4:  don't even like mount these key caps ever. They just keep it in a display

102
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,280
Speaker 4:  box. And I actually got into that. That was kind of how I got

103
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,680
Speaker 4:  into making the keycaps in the first place because I used to collect them.

104
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,560
Speaker 4:  And it's just one of those things, it's like a, you know, like collecting

105
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,520
Speaker 4:  funko pops or something where you're, you just really like something and

106
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,000
Speaker 4:  you, you'll collect a lot of it and you kind of trade around different keycaps

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,880
Speaker 4:  and so that's like one that's just a very small portion of the bigger hobby.

108
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,360
Speaker 4:  But because people can be like, okay, well I wanna keyboard but I really

109
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,000
Speaker 4:  like these cool like little art pieces I can collect and put them

110
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,800
Speaker 4:  on my keyboard if I want to. But there's people who also just really are

111
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,440
Speaker 4:  into like, I really want something that sounds a certain way

112
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:32,160
Speaker 4:  or I, I want it to sound like nothing at all. I don't want it, I don't want

113
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,160
Speaker 4:  any sounds when I'm typing because I just want it to be quiet or I want it

114
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,920
Speaker 4:  to feel like stiffer or harder or maybe a very

115
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,440
Speaker 4:  light touch. And I think like people can get into it however they want to.

116
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,360
Speaker 4:  And the fact that you also don't really have to get into it if

117
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,000
Speaker 4:  you don't want to think. A lot of people see how crazy like the,

118
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,320
Speaker 4:  the hobby can get and they're like, oh there's so much to to kind of like

119
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,000
Speaker 4:  think about to learn and you could just go in and get

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,800
Speaker 4:  something just like a one time thing and that will last you many, many years

121
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,600
Speaker 4:  and you don't ever have to like go really deep into the hobby. You can just

122
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,960
Speaker 4:  kind of pick out something that you like and just stop there. So I think

123
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,960
Speaker 4:  like the flexibility and the kind of the customization of the hobby really

124
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:14,000
Speaker 4:  allows people to be as much into it in whatever fashion

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,680
Speaker 4:  they want to or not at all. I think your workspace and how

126
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,560
Speaker 4:  it looks affects how you function in that workspace.

127
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,520
Speaker 4:  And I think we saw a huge growth in the hobby, like the

128
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,960
Speaker 4:  lockdown and pandemic happened in the start of that because everyone had

129
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,920
Speaker 4:  to kind of buy their own like work from home

130
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,080
Speaker 4:  workspaces. And so the keyboard might actually probably be the most

131
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,200
Speaker 4:  like customizable part of that. So I think people

132
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,320
Speaker 4:  really like to just make something their own and

133
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,960
Speaker 4:  it affects how they, how you see your workspace and how you feel in that

134
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,320
Speaker 4:  space. And I think that's the, the impact that it has is big considering

135
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,600
Speaker 4:  how like it's not really a big thing but it can have a big impact.

136
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,800
Speaker 3:  Now you have mentioned that what a lot

137
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,320
Speaker 3:  of people associate with a mechanical keyboard or sort of these like very

138
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,360
Speaker 3:  loud clicky switches. So there's sort of like clicky

139
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,200
Speaker 3:  switches and linear switches. The linear ones are sort of the higher end

140
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,840
Speaker 3:  ones that a lot of enthusiasts like to use when they build.

141
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:17,160
Speaker 3:  What setup are you using the most these days? Like what is

142
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,000
Speaker 3:  your favorite keyboard switch profile set? Like what's your,

143
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,800
Speaker 3:  what's your setup for the enthusiasts? Listening

144
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,520
Speaker 4:  I have in front of me is, it's called a Mr suit. It's just the name

145
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,480
Speaker 4:  of the keyboard and the trend or maybe the

146
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,160
Speaker 4:  past year or twos trend is this kind of Marly, like

147
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,600
Speaker 4:  thk. It's just terms that we use. But marbly thoughty sound,

148
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,680
Speaker 4:  I'm not sure if you can, it's really hard for me to like record the sound

149
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,400
Speaker 4:  because I feel like I've tried even with my phone or just to get it in a

150
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,000
Speaker 4:  video even with a nice mic setup, I just feel like it doesn't capture the,

151
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:55,040
Speaker 4:  like marly sound quite well and,

152
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,880
Speaker 4:  and hearing it in person is kind of like, it just, I don't know how to describe

153
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,720
Speaker 4:  it. It just kind of like hits differently when you're, when you hear I can,

154
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,480
Speaker 4:  I can type on it really quick but this is a, the trend is

155
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,040
Speaker 4:  kind of putting foam into the, the keyboard and

156
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,920
Speaker 4:  it mutes a lot of the kind of like thick, yeah, yeah, it's like a thick,

157
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,080
Speaker 4:  more like dense kind of sound.

158
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,920
Speaker 3:  Okay. We're gonna take a break and then I'll talk with Tiny about her creative

159
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,280
Speaker 3:  process.

160
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,440
Speaker 3:  All right. I'm back with Tiny Makes things.

161
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,160
Speaker 3:  I would like to move on from mechanical keyboards in general to your work

162
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,040
Speaker 3:  with custom key caps and talk about your creative process.

163
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,240
Speaker 3:  So what is the very first key cap that you made?

164
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,920
Speaker 4:  The very first key cap to my recollection because

165
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:01,040
Speaker 4:  it's been many years was actually this link

166
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,040
Speaker 4:  and Zelda, well I actually made a pair of just like this

167
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,760
Speaker 4:  kind of cheapy like cartoon five version of Link

168
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,760
Speaker 4:  and Zelda and I actually, it was just kind of a thing that I wanted

169
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,520
Speaker 4:  to try out doing and I think somebody actually, I saw

170
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,360
Speaker 4:  a post on like one of the subreddits that was asking about like, oh

171
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,120
Speaker 4:  you know, does anybody know if Link keycaps exist? I

172
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,440
Speaker 4:  wanna get one for like me and my girlfriend or something like that. And that's

173
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,040
Speaker 4:  why I made two of them. And I actually remember reaching out in DMS to this

174
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,240
Speaker 4:  person after I made them and I sent a picture of it and I was like, Hey,

175
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,720
Speaker 4:  do you like want these? I literally like offering them for free

176
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,880
Speaker 4:  cuz I made them and I, back then I wasn't even making them as you know, like

177
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,800
Speaker 4:  as an artist. I don't think they ever responded. So I was just like, oh you

178
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,560
Speaker 4:  know, I guess that's, that's that like it's not good enough or

179
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,280
Speaker 4:  whatever. I think it was just like a random, I, I just thought about it cause

180
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,280
Speaker 4:  I was like, I don't think there are, back then there weren't a lot of people

181
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,160
Speaker 4:  making custom and that's maybe where I got this idea like

182
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,120
Speaker 4:  oh I can make certain characters and designs for

183
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,760
Speaker 4:  people that are looking for looking for those design in the hobby because

184
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:10,720
Speaker 4:  it doesn't really exist at that point. It wasn't like a full

185
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,520
Speaker 4:  blown thing that it is now. So yeah, that's the one that I remember

186
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,120
Speaker 4:  off, I guess the top of my head that I made.

187
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:21,320
Speaker 3:  So how did that initial pair of key cap snowball

188
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,280
Speaker 3:  into what you're doing now? Is it, was it a process of like, like you

189
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,200
Speaker 3:  mentioned, was it a process of being on subreddits and joining

190
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,160
Speaker 3:  mechanical keyboard communities and offering those commissions? Or was

191
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,120
Speaker 3:  it more of I'll just start making and then post them and see if people

192
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,280
Speaker 3:  wanna buy them?

193
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:42,720
Speaker 4:  I would say maybe it is a combination of that. After I started

194
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,520
Speaker 4:  making them, I obviously was like, okay well you know, me reaching out

195
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,440
Speaker 4:  randomly to people, the chances of people being like, oh I would like a

196
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,160
Speaker 4:  key cap or I guess the eventual goal is to to be paid for the

197
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,560
Speaker 4:  keycaps. If it was something that I wanted to do but even in the beginning

198
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,040
Speaker 4:  I would just make them and then we'll see kind of where it goes from there.

199
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,040
Speaker 4:  And I think I made Keycaps that I

200
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,600
Speaker 4:  personally thought were cool or the designs that I

201
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,400
Speaker 4:  really liked. It wasn't one of my first, I would say sales

202
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,320
Speaker 4:  or ideas was, well what I called sus keys, which were just

203
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,160
Speaker 4:  like sushi keys. It would be like a, you know, a salmon or

204
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,840
Speaker 4:  tuna that's like mounted on top of like a white key cap so it kind of looks

205
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,720
Speaker 4:  like a little sushi. And so I made maybe a couple of those and

206
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,560
Speaker 4:  then the way I guess most people go about you, you post on like one of the

207
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,320
Speaker 4:  redheads and you just kinda announce like your sale that it's happening at

208
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,000
Speaker 4:  a certain time and this is how you can buy one. When I first started making

209
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,560
Speaker 4:  keycaps I was very inconsistent about it. I was working a full-time job and

210
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,080
Speaker 4:  when you get home you just wanna like, just like potato and, and just play

211
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,880
Speaker 4:  video games or watch TV and then yeah like you don't wanna do anything PR

212
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,560
Speaker 4:  productive cuz you kind of, you just feel like tired. And then I just felt

213
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,120
Speaker 4:  very kind of like my life was just not going

214
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,160
Speaker 4:  anywhere cuz I was like, I'm working full-time now and is this just what

215
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,560
Speaker 4:  my life is gonna be for the rest? For the rest of it I come home and I'm

216
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,480
Speaker 4:  just like, I wanna watch tv.

217
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,200
Speaker 3:  I feel like everybody asks themself that question at a certain point. They're

218
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,800
Speaker 3:  just like, is this it?

219
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:13,760
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I was, I was like 20 whatever, 22 out of college and I

220
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,120
Speaker 4:  like, I

221
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,440
Speaker 3:  Have 22 when you're already asking, is this it? Oh no.

222
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:22,200
Speaker 4:  I was like, yeah I guess like for the next what, 40 years,

223
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,160
Speaker 4:  this is what like life is gonna be like. So I was, I was having a hard

224
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,280
Speaker 4:  time like getting myself to make the things even though I wanted to. And

225
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,880
Speaker 4:  so what I did to kind of make myself be more consistent about it is I

226
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,000
Speaker 4:  started streaming on Twitch, just the actual creative like key

227
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,960
Speaker 4:  cap process and a lot of times I wasn't even making keycaps like for

228
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,840
Speaker 4:  anyone specific or even for a sale. I was into Overwatch

229
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,480
Speaker 4:  back then, so I started making all of the characters from Overwatch. I think

230
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,880
Speaker 4:  I still have a lot of those keys that I, I just made the full cast of

231
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,480
Speaker 4:  the Overwatch characters, a

232
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,160
Speaker 3:  Lot of key caps.

233
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,880
Speaker 4:  Yeah it was a lot of key caps but it was a lot of like I, I would do it while

234
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,120
Speaker 4:  I'm streaming so then I had, you know, company, you know, people would stop

235
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,800
Speaker 4:  by so I, you know, I chat with people. It helped me be really consistent

236
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,400
Speaker 4:  because I would force myself to, you know, stream for a certain amount of

237
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,280
Speaker 4:  hours. And I think that really helped me practice and help

238
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,800
Speaker 4:  me kind of get better at the actual key cap making.

239
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,720
Speaker 4:  And then two, I think even though I don't think my stream was,

240
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,680
Speaker 4:  you know, super popular or anything, I think it did help me grow

241
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,720
Speaker 4:  and then I had to, not had to, but when you have a Twitch

242
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,280
Speaker 4:  you're like, okay, I also should be on another social media. So I was also

243
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,440
Speaker 4:  on Instagram and, and to, it gave me other outlets to kind share my work

244
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,840
Speaker 4:  and to really, you know, post about what I was making. And so I

245
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,960
Speaker 4:  think that helped grow my audience and also

246
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,080
Speaker 4:  potential, I guess clientele. And, and then from there I think I

247
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,720
Speaker 4:  started to get actual commissions and I would open up for, you know, like

248
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,120
Speaker 4:  a, hey I can take a certain amount of commissions and then people would request

249
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,600
Speaker 4:  certain things and then I would kind of do commissions and I could also stream

250
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,360
Speaker 4:  that as well. So it kind of like built on itself over

251
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,200
Speaker 4:  time. But I did really kind of start out just making without the

252
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,000
Speaker 4:  intention of like, I want to sell this. It was just like, I wanna make these

253
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,640
Speaker 4:  things cuz I think they're cool and I like them

254
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:16,000
Speaker 4:  and I wanna practice. And then eventually got to a point where I was

255
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,800
Speaker 4:  like, okay, look people are, people are interested. There's, there's a need

256
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,680
Speaker 4:  for kind of custom key caps in this space. That's how I, that's how I started

257
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:23,960
Speaker 4:  out.

258
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:28,080
Speaker 3:  I've heard this from multiple people, at least over a dozen

259
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:32,200
Speaker 3:  that have attributed their success in a

260
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,000
Speaker 3:  creative field to getting on Twitch and

261
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:40,200
Speaker 3:  being held accountable by their viewers to, to be consistent.

262
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:44,600
Speaker 3:  As your community has grown, do you stream the same amount they used to?

263
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,480
Speaker 3:  Do you stream more because now this is your full-time job. Do you find

264
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,240
Speaker 3:  that your community is really supportive or is it

265
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,960
Speaker 3:  more, has it more transitioned into a business

266
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,560
Speaker 3:  and customers situation on Twitch where a lot of your

267
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:03,520
Speaker 3:  viewers are sort of treated like a business relationship as opposed

268
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,760
Speaker 3:  to that sort of parasocial twitch relationship that we see? That's like very

269
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,040
Speaker 3:  common

270
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,440
Speaker 4:  In the first maybe two years of streaming, I was very

271
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,000
Speaker 4:  streaming a lot. I was very gung-ho about like, I need, you know,

272
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,680
Speaker 4:  I wanna hit partner, I wanna, you know, hit certain numbers or whatever it

273
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,640
Speaker 4:  was. I would just, I put a lot, I would say like 80% of

274
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,080
Speaker 4:  my effort and maybe 20% was still like he kept making but of my efforts into

275
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,960
Speaker 4:  streaming. And it was a really big thing for me to, to have that platform

276
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,800
Speaker 4:  and that community and just that space. And I think you're

277
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,720
Speaker 4:  right in, in that it really helped having that consistency. And I think a

278
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,920
Speaker 4:  lot of people, when I look back and even just thinking about it now, I think

279
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,720
Speaker 4:  what I do is not particularly hard, I would say like

280
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,560
Speaker 4:  the actual craft and, and I don't wanna say that in a way where I'm like,

281
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,480
Speaker 4:  oh this is so easy, but like I, I just, I sometimes I'm like,

282
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,280
Speaker 4:  yeah, I just did it for a long time. And consistently

283
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,360
Speaker 4:  and consistency is key for a lot of people because I would say a lot of people

284
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,840
Speaker 4:  also give up on, you know, on the way to doing something because you don't

285
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,760
Speaker 4:  see results or you're not seeing whatever you're expecting and

286
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,960
Speaker 4:  it's hard to kind of be in those places when you don't feel like you have

287
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,800
Speaker 4:  to hit some numbers or you feel like you're not growing as fast as other

288
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,640
Speaker 4:  people or whatever it is. It's sometimes really tough to stay in,

289
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,000
Speaker 4:  you know, that mindset and, and to keep doing things. So in the beginning

290
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,680
Speaker 4:  I would say streaming was my very kind of, I put all my effort into.

291
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,320
Speaker 4:  And then over time, I would say, especially since I kind of discovered

292
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:33,360
Speaker 4:  short-term video content was for me and my style and maybe

293
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,280
Speaker 4:  just my own personal like expression, I, I thought

294
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,160
Speaker 4:  that short video content really suited the way that I

295
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,040
Speaker 4:  like to share my art. Most of my TikTok of my art are

296
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,000
Speaker 4:  very quick, maybe like 15 to 20 seconds, like not time

297
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,800
Speaker 4:  lapses, but short kind of parts of me making things. And then you see the

298
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,240
Speaker 4:  final product

299
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,280
Speaker 4:  Sometimes that takes like hours to do and you get to see 15 seconds of it

300
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,760
Speaker 4:  completed really quickly. I just thought that was like easier for people

301
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,600
Speaker 4:  to digest obviously. And I got into TikTok right before the lockdown

302
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,360
Speaker 4:  and everything happened before I think TikTok blew up and when I got on the

303
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,480
Speaker 4:  platform I was like, this is, this is great. I don't have to, streaming is

304
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,320
Speaker 4:  fun but it's also, you know, you're, you're sitting through hour like you

305
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,800
Speaker 4:  have to prep for it, there's hours of it and then afterwards you're really

306
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,600
Speaker 4:  tired. But at least for these videos I could post it and just like leave

307
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,000
Speaker 4:  it there. I don't have to, there's nothing I have to do once I'm done with

308
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,640
Speaker 4:  it. After I started doing more short, short form like video content,

309
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:32,880
Speaker 4:  I just took a backseat from streaming and I don't

310
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,800
Speaker 4:  stream as often now, I would say like a couple times a month

311
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,560
Speaker 4:  maybe. I really still do enjoy the community and kind of

312
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,440
Speaker 4:  just the people that I've basically hung out with for the last like couple

313
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,080
Speaker 4:  years and the people who are there when I wasn't, you know, whatever

314
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,760
Speaker 4:  influencer or content creator. I think I really value

315
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:55,560
Speaker 4:  just those connections that I've made in in the past and it's like

316
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,040
Speaker 4:  kind of just like seeing friends from time to time when I, when I stream

317
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,640
Speaker 4:  now. So it's not something that I use particularly

318
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:07,000
Speaker 4:  to like grow anything. I guess at this point it's more of a hey I wanna

319
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,760
Speaker 4:  hang out with a community, I kind of just wanna relax and like do

320
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,640
Speaker 4:  something. But you know, it's just there to kind of like relax and catch

321
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,600
Speaker 4:  up and not use it as a this is my thing, this is what makes

322
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,080
Speaker 4:  me money, this is like, you know, and I think it was like that in the beginning

323
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,360
Speaker 4:  where I felt like, oh I wanna be, you know, a really big streamer and make

324
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,480
Speaker 4:  lots of money or whatever it is. And for me I just kind of felt like, yeah

325
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,160
Speaker 4:  I, I don't know if I'll ever reach that point and, and

326
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,920
Speaker 4:  maybe I don't want to cuz I feel like when it gets big it's hard to

327
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,880
Speaker 4:  have like close community and I really value that aspect of it.

328
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,840
Speaker 3:  All right, we're gonna take one more break and then I'll chat with Tiny about

329
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,760
Speaker 3:  the challenges of making her keycaps and the accessories

330
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,360
Speaker 3:  she's making for them.

331
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,600
Speaker 3:  Okay, I'm back with tiny.

332
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,680
Speaker 3:  I am curious about the most complicated key cap

333
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,440
Speaker 3:  that you've ever made and how long it took for you to make.

334
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:13,920
Speaker 4:  So that question is sort of difficult to answer in a sense

335
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,720
Speaker 4:  that sometimes I take like days, weeks, months or

336
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,760
Speaker 4:  whatever to kind of prototype a key cap and that's a lot of

337
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:25,800
Speaker 4:  design and then you like sand things down, you maybe cast it to see

338
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,840
Speaker 4:  what it would look like and then you kind of go back to the drawing board

339
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,400
Speaker 4:  if something doesn't go back you can sand things off and remake it. So

340
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:36,240
Speaker 4:  that's hard because it's technically it is one key cap, but then

341
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:40,160
Speaker 4:  once you finish like the master, the initial key,

342
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,120
Speaker 4:  you can make like tons of it after. So sometimes just things take a

343
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,000
Speaker 4:  lot of like reiteration just based on the design. I'm generally

344
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:51,640
Speaker 4:  a more fast-paced designer, kind of like

345
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,680
Speaker 4:  less intricate but more like more designs. Like I've made a lot

346
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,240
Speaker 4:  of different designs. I kind of just, you know, hammer them out just to kind

347
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,280
Speaker 4:  of get something on the table. I, I think it's just like the, my style of

348
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,000
Speaker 4:  doing things. One of the design, I'm just gonna name one that I don't know

349
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,760
Speaker 4:  if it is the most difficult one, but it's a little panda

350
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,800
Speaker 4:  and I have it here.

351
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,560
Speaker 3:  But for anyone listening it's an extremely cute

352
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,200
Speaker 3:  panda key cap. And I'm sure you can see it on your

353
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,680
Speaker 3:  Instagram.

354
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:23,520
Speaker 4:  It is on my Instagram. The, the thing that this makes this hard though and

355
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:27,480
Speaker 4:  what maybe people don't really recognize from the get-go is

356
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,040
Speaker 4:  that when you make a key cap like this, which has multiple

357
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:35,120
Speaker 4:  many black and white kind of like layers, the key cap is actually

358
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,920
Speaker 4:  made upside down and it, and what I mean by that is the mold is

359
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:42,120
Speaker 4:  it's casted upside down before in, in this mold

360
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,960
Speaker 4:  basically it's poured into a mold and so it's a

361
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,040
Speaker 4:  liquid and you have to fill up this liquid in

362
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,320
Speaker 4:  order,

363
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,080
Speaker 3:  It's like a jello mold. Yeah. So you have a clear jello mold you pour in

364
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,520
Speaker 3:  if you're making different color layers. Yes you have to like pour in a layer,

365
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,400
Speaker 3:  let it set, pour in a new layer, let it

366
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,320
Speaker 4:  Set. Yes, exactly. That is a great way to explain

367
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,120
Speaker 4:  it. And so you have to think about like his eyes and his ears, those

368
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,520
Speaker 4:  are all like black and those are not like a whole layer. Those are like,

369
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,840
Speaker 4:  you have to take like a needle basically something very tiny and I'm just

370
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:17,720
Speaker 4:  tapping it into the resin and like dripping

371
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,440
Speaker 4:  it as carefully as I can into these areas. So this is like a maybe

372
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,240
Speaker 4:  six shots, what we call, so I have to do the, the eyes and the ears

373
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,880
Speaker 4:  and the nose and that's, they're all black and the next layer is white, which

374
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,840
Speaker 4:  is his like face. So that's another layer. And then you do his arms and then

375
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,360
Speaker 4:  you have to do his like toe pads which are white and then you have to do

376
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,240
Speaker 4:  his legs which are black. And then the last layer is the white. So it's like,

377
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,160
Speaker 4:  I think that's six. And any part that you get wrong in the

378
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,040
Speaker 4:  middle, you just, the cap is, I just, I don't usually sell like the what

379
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,600
Speaker 4:  I call B stock or something that's like slightly if, if there's bubbles or

380
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,560
Speaker 4:  whatever if you mess up and the lines aren't clean. So it's just

381
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,200
Speaker 4:  frustrating because if you mess up in the middle you're like, crap, I gotta

382
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:00,960
Speaker 4:  go back and redo it again. And can't really like undo the

383
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,840
Speaker 4:  layers. You can't go back, you just start over again. So this is more

384
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,520
Speaker 4:  just like a complicated process, one not very like I wouldn't

385
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,720
Speaker 4:  say like the details are super intricate, it's just the process was

386
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,120
Speaker 4:  tiring and, and I didn't get a lot of like the yield wise was very

387
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,960
Speaker 4:  low, the successful pandas that came out of this.

388
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:24,240
Speaker 3:  So when you are making key caps, you also have

389
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,360
Speaker 3:  what I have deemed accessories for your key caps you ha,

390
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,520
Speaker 3:  which I find extremely adorable but also very clever.

391
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,880
Speaker 3:  For example, you have these kind of little Kirby with open mouths and then

392
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,800
Speaker 3:  you have for a shift key for example, you've got a, a piece of corn

393
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,520
Speaker 3:  like an ear of corn that you can drop onto the top of that and

394
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,320
Speaker 3:  remove if so desired. I would love to hear

395
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,240
Speaker 3:  about how that came about. Your work was

396
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,600
Speaker 3:  the first time I had ever seen accessories for custom key caps or

397
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,360
Speaker 3:  removable parts for custom key caps. And I'd love to know

398
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:03,040
Speaker 3:  sort of how that experimentation kind of came

399
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:03,600
Speaker 3:  about.

400
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,880
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I think when I think about keycaps and the design of it,

401
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:11,800
Speaker 4:  a lot of what I think about is how do I make this fun and

402
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:15,200
Speaker 4:  kind of like a toy And I think maybe not the only

403
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:19,320
Speaker 4:  source of inspiration, but I was really into hats

404
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,000
Speaker 4:  when I was playing TF two team Fortress two, it's a

405
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,800
Speaker 4:  shooter game, but there was this whole economy that had to do with like literal

406
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:30,160
Speaker 4:  hats in the game. And I, I think all the time I'm just thinking about key

407
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,800
Speaker 4:  caps, I don't know, just like ideas come and go. So I was like, would it

408
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,080
Speaker 4:  be, it wouldn't be cool if you had a key cap ahead, you know, like hats or

409
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,720
Speaker 4:  something that you could just swap around and give it, like things that it

410
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,160
Speaker 4:  could take off or put it on. I didn't end up doing

411
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,440
Speaker 4:  something specifically like hats for for Kirby, but I think it was just the

412
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,040
Speaker 4:  idea of like either modularity, I always think that's kind of a cool

413
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,920
Speaker 4:  concept of like being able to swap things out with other things or like

414
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,840
Speaker 4:  move things around for keyboards even there's actually keyboards that

415
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,920
Speaker 4:  have like numb pads that are modular, which I think is really cool idea.

416
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,760
Speaker 4:  But I just think about in general when I think, when I think about design,

417
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,320
Speaker 4:  I'm always just trying to think of like what other things can we do with

418
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:14,040
Speaker 4:  with keycaps and it's hard because it's such a small space. You obviously

419
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,720
Speaker 4:  have like restrictions about what you can really do in a certain space.

420
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,760
Speaker 3:  Yeah, you have a, yeah, there's a few of 'em got a few accessories for the,

421
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,520
Speaker 3:  the little curvy,

422
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:25,480
Speaker 4:  I think the first ones came as tongues and I think maybe

423
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,320
Speaker 4:  it even came out during a stream, which I, I feel like I,

424
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,880
Speaker 4:  there was one time when I was just making different things for

425
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,400
Speaker 4:  Kirby's face, but it wasn't like magnetic yet. I think I was just adding

426
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,200
Speaker 4:  like teeth, which makes Kirby look very weird or like

427
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,120
Speaker 4:  glasses and yeah, just kind of facial accessories. And

428
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,840
Speaker 4:  I think maybe it came up to meet or to think about like, oh

429
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,480
Speaker 4:  maybe if he did have a magnet in his mouth, it could be a magnetic

430
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,120
Speaker 4:  accessory that you could pop in and out and then it also wouldn't be as

431
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,200
Speaker 4:  haphazard.

432
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:58,840
Speaker 3:  Yeah it's, it snaps on. Yeah right. It just snaps right

433
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,800
Speaker 4:  On it. Exactly. And if it comes off it's, that's part of the design, right?

434
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,000
Speaker 4:  Like it doesn't, you don't need to for it to be bonded in that position.

435
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,760
Speaker 4:  And I think it might be dangerous if there was actually like a tongue

436
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,400
Speaker 4:  coming out or something like skinny like that. So yeah, I think I, I think

437
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,720
Speaker 4:  I had that idea and I was like oh let me play around with it. I think I thought

438
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,480
Speaker 4:  about magnetic keycaps long ago but I just didn't really, one,

439
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:23,600
Speaker 4:  it's hard to like mass produce at a scale and I thought it would be fun

440
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:27,480
Speaker 4:  to have it in between like different artists to have

441
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:31,040
Speaker 4:  some sort of like base or standard magnet. So like if I make

442
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,560
Speaker 4:  accessories and someone else makes accessories but we use the like different

443
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:38,520
Speaker 4:  polarity then they won't work with each other. But my original

444
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,360
Speaker 4:  idea was like what if there was a standard and we had all these little accessories

445
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,760
Speaker 4:  and not just it being like, you know, a tongue

446
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,560
Speaker 4:  specifically but like, you know, Kirby could eat anything. So if you had

447
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,160
Speaker 4:  like another key cap that maybe did have hats, Kirby could eat hats, I don't

448
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,400
Speaker 4:  know, you know like it could be something that you could use swap among your,

449
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,560
Speaker 4:  your key caps and you could even, you know, standardize it if you did wanna

450
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,200
Speaker 4:  say like, oh maybe food things. And then we all release like our own food

451
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,320
Speaker 4:  things for our own key caps but then you can swap it among different makers

452
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:10,040
Speaker 4:  and different, you know, kind of themes or or whatever. And then

453
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,800
Speaker 4:  anybody could make little magnetic things cuz you could buy one of these

454
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,280
Speaker 4:  and just make your own accessories and it would be really easy. And I think

455
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,400
Speaker 4:  like sharing that and having that in a space was something that I was really

456
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,320
Speaker 4:  excited about. I actually have not ever actually released

457
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:28,200
Speaker 4:  a magnetic cby like to sell. Like I don't think I've ever sold them. I just

458
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,480
Speaker 4:  made them and I just throw them on myself. But yeah, that was the original

459
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,360
Speaker 4:  idea and kind of how I wanted this to go and wanted people to

460
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,560
Speaker 4:  kind of experience this and have, yeah, just like cool things that you can

461
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,080
Speaker 4:  throw on your keyboard at Keycaps at any time.

462
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:46,160
Speaker 3:  That's so fun and, and I encourage everybody to go look at your

463
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,840
Speaker 3:  Instagram page because there are some very delightful videos there

464
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:53,840
Speaker 3:  of examples of all of this that we're talking about. It's, it helps put a

465
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,560
Speaker 3:  visual to the description I'm sure. I think my very last

466
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,520
Speaker 3:  question for you is, I would love to hear your advice to anybody

467
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,480
Speaker 3:  who sees your work or the work of another custom key

468
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,320
Speaker 3:  cap creator or mechanical keyboard enthusiast and wants to

469
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,160
Speaker 3:  get into this either as a hobby or a line of

470
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,800
Speaker 3:  work to go into business for themselves. I, I think you have a lot of experience

471
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,720
Speaker 3:  here that is very valuable that you could share. And if you have

472
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,200
Speaker 3:  any advice for those people who feel inspired, what would it be

473
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,520
Speaker 4:  For people who just want to get a keyboard and

474
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,440
Speaker 4:  to learn more about it? We have these, not we, but the community

475
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:36,680
Speaker 4:  as a whole has these meetups, they're just called keyboard meetups and people

476
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,400
Speaker 4:  just bring their own keyboards and we're just usually in one big

477
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,240
Speaker 4:  space and you just talk to people about keyboards for

478
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,200
Speaker 4:  like hours. It is probably one of the best ways to really

479
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,080
Speaker 4:  get a good deep dive into keyboards

480
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,520
Speaker 4:  if you want to spend the least amount of time like

481
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:59,520
Speaker 4:  studying or learning or researching about it. It's

482
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,960
Speaker 4:  really easy to go into one of these places and I, I wanna say that they're

483
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,480
Speaker 4:  beginner or like friendly to people who are into the hobby.

484
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,320
Speaker 4:  Obviously if you're there it's likely that you are already in the hobby but

485
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,400
Speaker 4:  everyone is really psyched to talk about keyboards. Like you could probably

486
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,400
Speaker 4:  go up to anybody and be like, Hey can you, you know, I'm new to this, can

487
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,160
Speaker 4:  you explain to me about keyboards? And I would say like a good amount of

488
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,960
Speaker 4:  the people there would happily talk your ears off about keyboards for

489
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,080
Speaker 4:  the entire time. It's a great place to just see a very wide variety of

490
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,920
Speaker 4:  everything. And I'm gonna make take this chance to plug in if

491
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,600
Speaker 4:  you are local to the Bay Area in northern California,

492
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:40,600
Speaker 4:  I actually opened up a keyboard shop in downtown San Jose.

493
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:44,880
Speaker 4:  You can just search tiny keyboard shop and it is literally

494
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:48,200
Speaker 4:  a tiny keyboard shop. But if you're new to the hobby and would just like

495
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,840
Speaker 4:  to learn and you don't wanna go to a meetup, you can go there and kind of

496
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,600
Speaker 4:  experience keyboards and we'll happily explain to you everything you want

497
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,520
Speaker 4:  to know about keyboards and you can also walk away

498
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,520
Speaker 4:  with a keyboard if you would like to or and or any of the

499
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,720
Speaker 4:  accessories that are related to keyboards.

500
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:18,320
Speaker 3:  Thanks again to Tiny for sitting down and talking to me in this

501
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,600
Speaker 3:  interview. Alex, I just want to know

502
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,840
Speaker 3:  how many mechanical keyboards you've purchased in the time

503
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:28,120
Speaker 3:  between the start of this interview and now.

504
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,480
Speaker 2:  I don't think I'm allowed to respond to that. Legally. I have to consult

505
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,560
Speaker 2:  with my lawyers. Are you gonna go get one?

506
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:37,000
Speaker 3:  I think I have to right now. I think I've got to, after talking to Tiny,

507
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,120
Speaker 3:  I'm really excited about it. I wanna learn more about the community

508
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:44,480
Speaker 3:  and from what I have seen, a lot of people are just super welcoming in places

509
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:48,480
Speaker 3:  like the subreddits and other, other groups that you

510
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,600
Speaker 3:  can find online, discords, things like that. People have just been really

511
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,520
Speaker 3:  welcoming and they want to help you be an enthusiast. So it's really, it's

512
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,440
Speaker 3:  a great community. It

513
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,520
Speaker 2:  Is a great community. I a hundred percent recommend going to like a meetup

514
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,320
Speaker 2:  cuz everybody brings their keyboards and the thing that everybody wants you

515
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,920
Speaker 2:  to do is like type on their

516
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,280
Speaker 3:  Keyboards. I think that sounds like a great idea. And I'm sure being in Los

517
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,040
Speaker 3:  Angeles, I'm sure there are lots of meetups.

518
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:13,960
Speaker 2:  I think you will have no problem finding a meetup. All right, well

519
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,560
Speaker 2:  thank you again so much, Ashley, we've got one more

00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,520
Speaker 3:  Marco Arment is gonna talk to me about being a solo app developer and,

526
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,400
Speaker 3:  and his, his journey into that arena

527
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,280
Speaker 3:  and also the time he has spent in the space and he's been

528
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,920
Speaker 3:  there since pretty much the beginning of the App store. So it's been, it

529
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,840
Speaker 3:  was a really, it's a really good conversation.

530
