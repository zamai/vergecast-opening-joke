00:00:41,495 --> 00:00:44,965
Speaker 3:  Hello and Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of making things

3
00:00:44,995 --> 00:00:48,285
Speaker 3:  translucent. Then a little less translucent, then a little more translucent.

4
00:00:48,285 --> 00:00:52,045
Speaker 3:  Again, I'm Jay Castor Nacas, executive editor at The Verge, NELI Patel, David Pierce.

5
00:00:52,045 --> 00:00:55,325

6
00:00:55,325 --> 00:00:59,165
Speaker 3:  some time off on parental leave. They'll be back later this year. Today

7
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:03,285
Speaker 3:  we've got a really fun show later on. VERGE Transportation

Speaker 3:  Matthew Kang is gonna come on. And we're gonna be talking about Tesla and

10
00:01:10,285 --> 00:01:13,885
Speaker 3:  the new Tesla Diner. I thought this was a joke when they announced it. It

11
00:01:13,885 --> 00:01:17,325
Speaker 3:  is a real thing. They really announced this and launched a diner.

12
00:01:18,715 --> 00:01:22,165
Speaker 3:  Then the thunder round is back. New and improved as always.

13
00:01:22,705 --> 00:01:26,365
Speaker 3:  But first it's a big Apple week. So we've gotta talk about Apple.

14
00:01:27,015 --> 00:01:30,285
Speaker 3:  We've got two VERGE reviewers here to talk about it in the studio with me.

15
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:34,085
Speaker 3:  Vee Song. Hello. And we've got Antonio

16
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:38,085
Speaker 3:  d Benedetto. Hello. So breaking news, like an hour

17
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:41,845
Speaker 3:  ago right before we recorded this, apple launched The public betas for

18
00:01:42,505 --> 00:01:46,205
Speaker 3:  iOS 26, iPadOS 26 watch, west

19
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:50,045
Speaker 3:  26. I think like everything, except everything is Os No, everything

20
00:01:50,045 --> 00:01:53,965
Speaker 3:  is 26. Everything is 26 now. Everything is 26 now. You

21
00:01:53,965 --> 00:01:57,565
Speaker 3:  can now download them, you can try them out. Maybe don't if it's like your

22
00:01:57,565 --> 00:02:01,085
Speaker 3:  primary device, but if you got an extra iPad lying around, this is its moment.

23
00:02:01,345 --> 00:02:04,805
Speaker 3:  So big features across the board. There's Liquid Glass, the brand new design

24
00:02:04,895 --> 00:02:08,845
Speaker 3:  style that is across all the new operating systems. There's new

25
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:12,845
Speaker 3:  games app, there are lots of power user features, particularly on the

26
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:16,765
Speaker 3:  Mac and the iPad. So v Antonio, both of you have been testing these for a

27
00:02:16,765 --> 00:02:20,645
Speaker 3:  while because you've been in the developer beta. I just got my hands on

28
00:02:20,645 --> 00:02:24,485
Speaker 3:  with these because okay, I got banned from the developer beta.

29
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:27,245
Speaker 3:  Did you know that you can get kicked out of the developer? I did not know.

30
00:02:27,595 --> 00:02:31,445
Speaker 3:  What did you do? I didn't think I did anything. So I, so this is

31
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:34,565
Speaker 3:  like new-ish, right? Like Apple used to require you to like pay a hundred

32
00:02:34,565 --> 00:02:37,645
Speaker 3:  dollars or something to get in the developer program if you wanted to get

33
00:02:37,645 --> 00:02:41,045
Speaker 3:  the developer betas. And a lot of people were like, yeah, sure, but recently

34
00:02:41,065 --> 00:02:44,565
Speaker 3:  you've been able to like get in for free, which is great, right? Anybody

35
00:02:44,585 --> 00:02:48,045
Speaker 3:  can just get the developer beta if they really want to. However,

36
00:02:48,785 --> 00:02:52,045
Speaker 3:  you have to fill out an application, right? There's like, you have to find

37
00:02:52,195 --> 00:02:55,645
Speaker 3:  some weird web pages. I know you both went through this, but you gotta find

38
00:02:55,645 --> 00:02:58,965
Speaker 3:  the right webpage. You gotta go to the application. And then it says like,

39
00:02:59,105 --> 00:03:03,085
Speaker 3:  put in your information to apply. And I was like, yeah, sure. I've

40
00:03:03,085 --> 00:03:06,685
Speaker 3:  put in my information on a million forms on the web every single day.

41
00:03:06,865 --> 00:03:10,685
Speaker 3:  So I'm like, Jake, okay, here's my address. Turns out

42
00:03:11,145 --> 00:03:14,085
Speaker 3:  if you do not precisely enter this information,

43
00:03:14,815 --> 00:03:18,605
Speaker 3:  apple compares it to your Apple id. And they're like, no, no, no, no, this

44
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:19,045
Speaker 3:  is not correct.

45
00:03:19,275 --> 00:03:20,405
Speaker 4:  This is privacy and

46
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:24,285
Speaker 3:  Security. Shut down. Oh goodness. Down and out. You're done. One

47
00:03:24,285 --> 00:03:27,805
Speaker 3:  chance, one chance, and you're, you're booted, you're banned for life. I

48
00:03:27,805 --> 00:03:31,005
Speaker 3:  think. So I googled this and there's a bunch of people on Reddit who are

49
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:34,445
Speaker 3:  just like, yeah man, I tried, I tried contacting, I've sent so many emails,

50
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:37,845
Speaker 3:  nobody responds. There's nothing you can do. You just gotta make a new Apple

51
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:39,405
Speaker 3:  id. You're just like, you're

52
00:03:39,405 --> 00:03:40,965
Speaker 4:  Stuck. Oh my God, that's

53
00:03:41,585 --> 00:03:43,845
Speaker 3:  Wow. The EU has to get involved, obviously,

54
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:47,245
Speaker 5:  Because that's the solution. If, if Fortnite can go back on the app store,

55
00:03:47,245 --> 00:03:49,845
Speaker 5:  then you can get the developer beta again. There's gotta be

56
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:53,565
Speaker 3:  A way I should be able to lie on my developer

57
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:57,045
Speaker 3:  application. Wow. I think it is, it is inappropriate

58
00:03:57,315 --> 00:03:59,605
Speaker 3:  that they enforced that I answer my name correctly.

59
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:01,565
Speaker 4:  Did you spell your

60
00:04:01,565 --> 00:04:04,245
Speaker 3:  Name wrong? I guess I, okay. I mean, yes.

61
00:04:06,005 --> 00:04:09,725
Speaker 3:  I think In fact that is what happened. And look, they got me there. I, I

62
00:04:09,725 --> 00:04:13,125
Speaker 3:  could have spelled my name better, but I didn't know they were checking.

63
00:04:13,665 --> 00:04:14,085
Speaker 3:  That's

64
00:04:14,425 --> 00:04:15,045
Speaker 4:  That's a little

65
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:17,885
Speaker 3:  Unhinged. Yeah, it's a little unhinged. That's honestly, honestly, that's

66
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:20,325
Speaker 3:  like extremely apple of them to be like Jack

67
00:04:20,665 --> 00:04:21,445
Speaker 5:  Castus strikes

68
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:25,325
Speaker 3:  Again. You, you have to do this precisely our way or,

69
00:04:25,385 --> 00:04:28,605
Speaker 3:  or you're not, you're not worthy of the developer Beta. I wasn't worthy.

70
00:04:28,705 --> 00:04:29,245
Speaker 3:  You two were.

71
00:04:30,065 --> 00:04:32,125
Speaker 4:  That's, I'm sorry.

72
00:04:32,825 --> 00:04:35,885
Speaker 3:  So as two worthy fellows

73
00:04:37,505 --> 00:04:41,405
Speaker 3:  in Apple's eyes and we're, you know, we're right, they announced Liquid

74
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:45,125
Speaker 3:  Glass, they announced new operating systems at wwc start of June. You've

75
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:48,245
Speaker 3:  both been testing these in different forms, different devices for the past

76
00:04:48,265 --> 00:04:52,045
Speaker 3:  two months. Liquid Glass was like, you know, controversial.

77
00:04:52,045 --> 00:04:55,085
Speaker 3:  Controversial first liquid s How are we, how are we feeling? Two months in

78
00:04:55,385 --> 00:04:55,805
Speaker 3:  liquid

79
00:04:56,165 --> 00:05:00,045
Speaker 4:  SI do not. Well, okay. I

80
00:05:00,045 --> 00:05:03,805
Speaker 4:  have a, I have a more nuanced take rather than just, it's all Ass,

81
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,925
Speaker 4:  which is it's ass on the iPhone, but it's okay on the watch

82
00:05:07,945 --> 00:05:11,565
Speaker 4:  and on on Mac. Interesting, interesting. It's okay on those platforms. And

83
00:05:11,565 --> 00:05:15,485
Speaker 4:  I think my problem with the phone, which I shall bring out now

84
00:05:15,485 --> 00:05:19,365
Speaker 4:  because you were asking me earlier to take a, take a little gander

85
00:05:19,365 --> 00:05:22,885
Speaker 4:  at it And I can't read anything. I just can't read

86
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:26,925
Speaker 4:  anything. Look at this, look at this. So it's just, if you have any

87
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:31,205
Speaker 4:  sort of background and any sort of background that is

88
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,805
Speaker 4:  not like a solid thing or, or an ombre gradient.

89
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:38,885
Speaker 4:  It's just so hard to read. And I think it's most visible

90
00:05:39,545 --> 00:05:43,485
Speaker 4:  in the Messages app and in the music app because in the music app there's

91
00:05:43,485 --> 00:05:46,405
Speaker 4:  like this little bar at the bottom and if you're trying to read the name

92
00:05:46,405 --> 00:05:49,365
Speaker 4:  of the song that's playing, but the album art is in the background, can't

93
00:05:49,365 --> 00:05:53,165
Speaker 4:  see, you can't see shit. It's just, how am I supposed to

94
00:05:53,165 --> 00:05:56,325
Speaker 4:  read this? How am I supposed to do anything about this? And in the Messages

95
00:05:56,325 --> 00:05:59,125
Speaker 4:  app, if you don't like, make the button outline

96
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:03,605
Speaker 4:  something that you toggle on in the accessibility setting, it just blends

97
00:06:03,605 --> 00:06:07,125
Speaker 4:  into everything. And then, you know, I have, I have garbage eyes, so I just

98
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,805
Speaker 4:  can't see anything And I can't read anything angry

99
00:06:08,805 --> 00:06:11,405
Speaker 3:  And I don't wanna shame you here, But that, that font is already blown up.

100
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:13,285
Speaker 3:  That's, that's not a small font. It's

101
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:16,405
Speaker 4:  Not a small font. It's not a false, I do, I have the big phone

102
00:06:17,225 --> 00:06:21,125
Speaker 4:  to, to blow up my font as large as I can. Like if, if

103
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:24,565
Speaker 4:  you're in studio, you could sit over there and you could read all my messages.

104
00:06:24,605 --> 00:06:28,325
Speaker 4:  I got nothing to hide. But like, I need that so that I can read. And it's

105
00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:32,285
Speaker 4:  just, so I had to turn on all the accessibility settings,

106
00:06:32,285 --> 00:06:36,045
Speaker 4:  which turns down the transparency, in which case there's no point in me having

107
00:06:36,705 --> 00:06:38,565
Speaker 4:  liquid glass on my phone.

108
00:06:38,635 --> 00:06:40,125
Speaker 3:  Does that get it to a usable place?

109
00:06:40,665 --> 00:06:44,205
Speaker 4:  It gets it to a usable place. 'cause it's much frostier. It's no longer liquid

110
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:45,485
Speaker 4:  glass. It's frosted glass. Well,

111
00:06:45,485 --> 00:06:48,485
Speaker 3:  Okay, but they've been changing it over the course of the betas, right? Like

112
00:06:48,485 --> 00:06:52,405
Speaker 3:  they made, they made it like more frosted. And now I think in the most

113
00:06:52,405 --> 00:06:53,845
Speaker 3:  recent one it is again, it's,

114
00:06:53,845 --> 00:06:54,245
Speaker 4:  It's Glos g

115
00:06:54,245 --> 00:06:54,605
Speaker 3:  Glassier

116
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:56,125
Speaker 4:  Again, it's Glossier again. And I was like,

117
00:06:56,205 --> 00:06:56,965
Speaker 3:  Hmm. Has it gotten better

118
00:06:57,105 --> 00:07:00,925
Speaker 4:  For you? No, not, not. Well there's like this new kind of

119
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:04,885
Speaker 4:  effect where when you bring up the notifications, it

120
00:07:04,915 --> 00:07:08,125
Speaker 4:  darkens a little bit. Okay, yeah. So then you can like, see it slightly better.

121
00:07:08,445 --> 00:07:11,205
Speaker 4:  I saw it And I was like, listen,

122
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:16,365
Speaker 4:  I already have by text blown up, blown up so that

123
00:07:16,525 --> 00:07:20,455
Speaker 4:  everyone can read it from Jupiter. Like just, just, just help

124
00:07:20,535 --> 00:07:23,975
Speaker 4:  a girl, help a girl out. Help a very,

125
00:07:24,605 --> 00:07:28,455
Speaker 4:  very blind as a bat girl out. Like it's not, it's, I just can't

126
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:32,255
Speaker 4:  read it that well. It's, it's all right. When I talk to people who are also

127
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:37,135
Speaker 4:  tech nerds and they've, so like, our, our, our old merchandising guy,

128
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,815
Speaker 4:  Parker, I chat with him every once in a while and he, he like, as soon as

129
00:07:40,815 --> 00:07:44,215
Speaker 4:  he's like, oh, you got the beta, okay, I put a wallpaper up in our chat

130
00:07:44,635 --> 00:07:48,455
Speaker 4:  and like, so there's like a wallpaper in our messages chat and like it changes

131
00:07:49,515 --> 00:07:53,055
Speaker 4:  the readability of it so that I can read it a bit better. And you know,

132
00:07:53,555 --> 00:07:57,495
Speaker 4:  in that one chat everything is fine, but all of my other friends and my family,

133
00:07:57,965 --> 00:07:59,375
Speaker 4:  it's just like, oh good lord.

134
00:07:59,885 --> 00:08:02,495
Speaker 3:  It's very funny of you have to much to optimize around it. Yeah,

135
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:03,415
Speaker 4:  You really do. It's

136
00:08:03,685 --> 00:08:06,895
Speaker 3:  Antonio. Is it like as extreme on the Mac?

137
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:11,415
Speaker 5:  No, I feel bad actually that it's that bad on the phone and I'm not

138
00:08:11,415 --> 00:08:14,575
Speaker 5:  looking for, so I, I kind of held off on installing it on my phone this time.

139
00:08:14,815 --> 00:08:18,255
Speaker 5:  'cause I had a pretty bad experience last year with, when Sequoia was in

140
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:21,415
Speaker 5:  developer preview, wrote absolutely wrecking my phone.

141
00:08:22,395 --> 00:08:26,295
Speaker 5:  So, but on the Mac side it's, it's kind of fine. It's just, it's

142
00:08:26,295 --> 00:08:30,055
Speaker 5:  like, I don't really particularly like it. I mean I'm, I I called it a bit

143
00:08:30,055 --> 00:08:32,655
Speaker 5:  of a snoozer in, in the, my writeup on it. But

144
00:08:33,885 --> 00:08:37,615
Speaker 5:  it's just whatever, because there's so much more room on a

145
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:41,895
Speaker 5:  bigger display that you, it's just kind of innocuous. It's like, okay, every

146
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:45,855
Speaker 5:  time I look at like another MacBook Air that I have on the side

147
00:08:45,855 --> 00:08:48,855
Speaker 5:  that I like ha was still on Sequoia And I was looking one-to-one. I'm like,

148
00:08:49,015 --> 00:08:51,575
Speaker 5:  I just like that better. I think that looks cleaner and nicer.

149
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:55,925
Speaker 5:  But then, you know, once you stare at liquid glass long enough, especially

150
00:08:55,925 --> 00:08:59,685
Speaker 5:  on a, on a 13 inch, 15 inch screen, a laptop or

151
00:08:59,825 --> 00:09:03,605
Speaker 5:  you know, a big monitor like I'm looking at right now, it's

152
00:09:03,605 --> 00:09:06,765
Speaker 5:  kind of whatever. 'cause it's kind of tucked away, you know, it's, it's in,

153
00:09:06,765 --> 00:09:09,765
Speaker 5:  it's in corners. It's in, you know, they, they move the widgets over to the

154
00:09:09,765 --> 00:09:13,645
Speaker 5:  desktop. You can still undo that, but it's on

155
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:16,445
Speaker 5:  the desktop and it's like kind of, it's in the top left corner. Your, your

156
00:09:16,475 --> 00:09:20,165
Speaker 5:  menu bar is, well, it's invisible now. You can undo that

157
00:09:20,305 --> 00:09:24,245
Speaker 5:  too. The doc is tucked to the bottom and

158
00:09:24,465 --> 00:09:27,165
Speaker 5:  you know, control center is, I, I never use, I don't use control center.

159
00:09:27,205 --> 00:09:28,845
Speaker 5:  I So on a Mac. On a Mac,

160
00:09:29,475 --> 00:09:33,445
Speaker 4:  Yeah, I do use it. What's the point? I, I'm shortcuts. Like,

161
00:09:33,445 --> 00:09:36,405
Speaker 4:  they added little shortcuts in there that I was like, oh, I can scrape record

162
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:40,205
Speaker 4:  a little easier. That's nice. But I did get really angry because

163
00:09:40,315 --> 00:09:44,085
Speaker 4:  they changed the, like the little icons in the

164
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:47,685
Speaker 4:  control center for Bluetooth and all of a sudden I couldn't access my Bluetooth

165
00:09:47,685 --> 00:09:51,365
Speaker 4:  devices easily. And I was just like, this is an obscene.

166
00:09:51,745 --> 00:09:54,805
Speaker 4:  And then I went to edit And I was like, oh, I could just put that back. That's

167
00:09:54,805 --> 00:09:55,445
Speaker 4:  fine. So

168
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:59,405
Speaker 5:  Yeah, see, but that's the advantage of a desktop operating system and

169
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:03,045
Speaker 5:  why usually these things are like, not such a big deal because there's so

170
00:10:03,045 --> 00:10:06,605
Speaker 5:  many different ways you can do all of this stuff, right? I have like in the

171
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:09,805
Speaker 5:  top right of my corner, I can go to control center, but I have another Bluetooth

172
00:10:10,075 --> 00:10:14,045
Speaker 5:  like dropdown menu with one click that actually has more

173
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:18,005
Speaker 5:  controls. And you know, the widgets are on the desktop

174
00:10:18,025 --> 00:10:20,805
Speaker 5:  now, but you can, you still have the option to push them back to the old

175
00:10:20,805 --> 00:10:24,045
Speaker 5:  way. So, you know, that's the thing is I think like with, with an iPhone,

176
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:29,085
Speaker 5:  iOS, iPadOS, like those kinds of smaller screens and you're

177
00:10:29,425 --> 00:10:33,365
Speaker 5:  and touch interfaces, you're limited in you the way you have to use it.

178
00:10:33,755 --> 00:10:37,485
Speaker 5:  When we, when Jay first, when Jay Peters first posted that

179
00:10:37,485 --> 00:10:41,405
Speaker 5:  picture of the, when the Del Beta launched day one and it was of con control

180
00:10:41,405 --> 00:10:45,245
Speaker 5:  center swiped down on his iPhone, that screenshot like horrified

181
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:48,405
Speaker 5:  me. I thought it was just so like hard to parse and yeah. And it was just

182
00:10:48,405 --> 00:10:51,765
Speaker 5:  so busy. And I'm like, okay, the, the Windows Vista

183
00:10:52,135 --> 00:10:55,685
Speaker 5:  jokes and memes are, are true. There's something to that. Like Microsoft

184
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:59,685
Speaker 5:  can go ahead and, you know, try to own them. Like they try tried it's, but

185
00:11:00,645 --> 00:11:04,625
Speaker 5:  on a Mac it's like, eh, it's fine. It's, I don't like it, but it can kind

186
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:08,105
Speaker 5:  of ignore it and just, you know, it's just, I think the usual way of these,

187
00:11:08,275 --> 00:11:12,265
Speaker 5:  these changes is that we'll kind of just get used to them. It's like,

188
00:11:12,535 --> 00:11:16,065
Speaker 5:  it's kind of a war of attrition, I think. I think eventually we just adjust.

189
00:11:16,705 --> 00:11:18,625
Speaker 4:  Absolutely not, I will hate this forever. Okay.

190
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:22,065
Speaker 5:  Oh no, I'll still dislike it. I'll still look back at Sequoia and like, that

191
00:11:22,065 --> 00:11:25,185
Speaker 5:  was better. Just the way a lot of us look back at fricking snow leopard.

192
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:29,305
Speaker 5:  Like that was really great, you know, but I just think that

193
00:11:29,305 --> 00:11:33,185
Speaker 5:  like, you just kind of get, get used to it again on a desktop os especially,

194
00:11:33,365 --> 00:11:37,345
Speaker 4:  You know, on a desktop, to your point, like the larger screen I think gives

195
00:11:37,345 --> 00:11:41,145
Speaker 4:  you more space to deal with the horrible transparency of it. It's not necessarily

196
00:11:41,145 --> 00:11:44,465
Speaker 4:  gonna be as bad, especially if you have multiple monitors, which many of

197
00:11:44,465 --> 00:11:48,145
Speaker 4:  us nerds do also on an even

198
00:11:48,145 --> 00:11:51,945
Speaker 4:  smaller screen than a phone. If you have, if you have a Apple watch,

199
00:11:51,975 --> 00:11:55,205
Speaker 4:  like you can see a little bit of the liquid gloss and the numbers

200
00:11:55,855 --> 00:11:59,765
Speaker 4:  there. Or like in the passcode, it's so not noticeable that

201
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:03,605
Speaker 4:  I don't care that it's on the watch at all. But on

202
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:07,405
Speaker 4:  my phone, on my phone, a device that I am on far

203
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:11,165
Speaker 4:  too often every day that has a ton of information and that, you

204
00:12:11,485 --> 00:12:15,405
Speaker 4:  know, what I realized from this experiment experience is that like, I'm

205
00:12:15,405 --> 00:12:19,205
Speaker 4:  using it to primarily read. Like I'm reading my notifications, I'm reading

206
00:12:19,225 --> 00:12:23,165
Speaker 4:  my messages, I am reading The Verge dot com every day. And

207
00:12:23,305 --> 00:12:26,805
Speaker 4:  you know, when you're going through things, when notifications pop up, it's

208
00:12:26,805 --> 00:12:27,965
Speaker 4:  just a mess.

209
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,685
Speaker 3:  So what's interesting, like, I I think another point of this is

210
00:12:32,255 --> 00:12:35,915
Speaker 3:  system UI is just so much more prevalent on a phone versus

211
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,875
Speaker 3:  on a laptop or on or a Mac, like Antonio is saying. And so

212
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:43,355
Speaker 3:  it's interesting 'cause like glass doesn't really get spread throughout third

213
00:12:43,355 --> 00:12:46,115
Speaker 3:  party apps. Like it's in the music app and you're like, this is really annoying

214
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:49,875
Speaker 3:  and ugly. Yeah. But like, if you're using Chrome on the

215
00:12:49,905 --> 00:12:53,715
Speaker 3:  desktop, I don't know, liquid, like in full screen, like where is liquid

216
00:12:53,715 --> 00:12:57,155
Speaker 3:  glass? It's nowhere. Whereas on the iPhone, you like cannot avoid it. You

217
00:12:57,155 --> 00:12:59,915
Speaker 3:  can't. It's so, okay, here's my feeling.

218
00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:04,555
Speaker 3:  It's a little chaotic And I love it And I want more chaos in our lives. I

219
00:13:04,555 --> 00:13:07,915
Speaker 3:  think, I think we should embrace like a slightly

220
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:12,995
Speaker 3:  unpolished, imperfect, messy design. Jake,

221
00:13:13,195 --> 00:13:16,355
Speaker 4:  I feel like you're chaotic evil on the d and d chart with that

222
00:13:16,355 --> 00:13:18,475
Speaker 3:  Take. Listen, is it a little hard to read? Absolutely.

223
00:13:20,475 --> 00:13:24,175
Speaker 3:  Is it like maybe a little, you know, not the most cutting edge

224
00:13:24,175 --> 00:13:28,015
Speaker 3:  thing, right? Is this something that like Windows did with Arrow like a decade

225
00:13:28,115 --> 00:13:31,815
Speaker 3:  or more ago? Yeah, of course, of course. Like is this gonna look dated at

226
00:13:31,815 --> 00:13:35,495
Speaker 3:  some point very soon? Like prob But you know what, go for it. I like it.

227
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,455
Speaker 3:  I want the, it's weird. It's cool. I remember when iOS seven came out,

228
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:44,005
Speaker 3:  they were just like, right, like pedal to the

229
00:13:44,005 --> 00:13:47,845
Speaker 3:  ground, right? They're like, we're going all the way, it's gonna be ridiculous.

230
00:13:47,965 --> 00:13:51,925
Speaker 3:  I was looking at old like, you know, beta one for

231
00:13:52,105 --> 00:13:55,805
Speaker 3:  iOS seven, there are some buttons and it's like, it says like

232
00:13:55,895 --> 00:13:58,565
Speaker 3:  swipe. And I'm like, I don't even know where to swipe. Like, it just, like,

233
00:13:58,565 --> 00:14:01,645
Speaker 3:  there's no, there's no button on it. It's just like a, it just a big thing

234
00:14:01,645 --> 00:14:04,525
Speaker 3:  that says swipe and it's like, I don't know what to do with this, but it's

235
00:14:04,525 --> 00:14:08,085
Speaker 3:  like, it's opinionated And I kind of love these

236
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:12,685
Speaker 3:  like immediate post redesign moments where you're like, this is a mess.

237
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:16,485
Speaker 3:  It's not perfect, but like, they're trying something and this is sort of

238
00:14:16,485 --> 00:14:18,925
Speaker 3:  like the purest version of the idea. And

239
00:14:20,845 --> 00:14:24,095
Speaker 3:  it's, it's, it's a problem because like this is going out to

240
00:14:24,415 --> 00:14:28,215
Speaker 3:  millions of people and it has to work for all of them.

241
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:32,655
Speaker 3:  And so like, you can't have major accessibility problems, which

242
00:14:32,655 --> 00:14:34,735
Speaker 3:  like making everything transparent.

243
00:14:35,325 --> 00:14:37,655
Speaker 4:  It's a major accessibility issue. Yeah.

244
00:14:37,995 --> 00:14:41,895
Speaker 3:  But like, I don't know. I don't know. I want a little, like, you're,

245
00:14:41,895 --> 00:14:44,295
Speaker 3:  you're showing me these things and it's like, I can't really read this. And

246
00:14:44,295 --> 00:14:48,135
Speaker 3:  I'm like, yeah man, let's scroll around a little bit. Keep on swiping.

247
00:14:48,135 --> 00:14:50,935
Speaker 3:  Eventually you'll be able to read it. Is it opinionated

248
00:14:50,965 --> 00:14:54,805
Speaker 5:  Though, or is it just more on the chaotic side? I, I can't, like, I, I know

249
00:14:54,805 --> 00:14:57,525
Speaker 5:  what I probably shouldn't like theorize or like conspiracy theorize, but

250
00:14:57,525 --> 00:15:01,245
Speaker 5:  it just, it, to me it just feels like they are like

251
00:15:01,245 --> 00:15:05,085
Speaker 5:  Apple. They, they being the designers like, but Apple as a whole is

252
00:15:05,115 --> 00:15:09,005
Speaker 5:  kind of just trying to distract from, I can't shake the feeling that

253
00:15:09,005 --> 00:15:12,405
Speaker 5:  they're trying to distract from like, oh don't, don't mind how Apple intelligence

254
00:15:12,865 --> 00:15:16,645
Speaker 5:  is kind of meh. And, and oh ignore that. You know,

255
00:15:16,995 --> 00:15:20,845
Speaker 5:  that new series we talked about and even had a, an advertisement featuring

256
00:15:20,885 --> 00:15:24,605
Speaker 5:  a celebrity and paid a lot of money for that. Afraid about that liquid

257
00:15:24,605 --> 00:15:27,485
Speaker 5:  glass. It's just, and it, and then they're, they're just fine. They're trying

258
00:15:27,485 --> 00:15:31,425
Speaker 5:  to fine tune it. I just, this is just speculation, but I just

259
00:15:31,425 --> 00:15:35,025
Speaker 5:  feel like they are like going a little seat of their pants here. Whereas

260
00:15:35,305 --> 00:15:38,985
Speaker 5:  I think iOS seven I think was, it had something to say. It was

261
00:15:38,985 --> 00:15:41,945
Speaker 5:  initially a little off the mark and they, they course corrected and you know,

262
00:15:42,045 --> 00:15:45,865
Speaker 5:  and made that made what they tweaked what they had to say here. I feel like

263
00:15:45,865 --> 00:15:49,785
Speaker 5:  they're just like tweaking for like, we gotta make this work. We gotta squa

264
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:53,785
Speaker 5:  like jam this round peg into a square

265
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:54,385
Speaker 5:  hole. Well

266
00:15:54,385 --> 00:15:57,265
Speaker 4:  Like the other thing is that liquid glass originates from

267
00:15:57,985 --> 00:16:01,905
Speaker 4:  famously the most successful apple hardware of all time. The Vision Pro.

268
00:16:02,765 --> 00:16:06,705
Speaker 4:  And so when you have liquid glass on the Vision Pro,

269
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:10,545
Speaker 4:  it makes sense. You are in a mixed reality headset. You need to

270
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:14,665
Speaker 4:  see through the menu to see what's around you. In

271
00:16:14,785 --> 00:16:18,705
Speaker 4:  I, I know, I understand that most people have not had the horror or

272
00:16:18,725 --> 00:16:22,705
Speaker 4:  the pleasure or the privilege of wearing this gigantic, very heavy headset

273
00:16:22,845 --> 00:16:26,825
Speaker 4:  on their face and looking around like it makes sense in Vision

274
00:16:27,045 --> 00:16:30,985
Speaker 4:  os because you need to see through the menu. I do

275
00:16:30,985 --> 00:16:34,905
Speaker 4:  not need to see through the menu on my phone. I need there to

276
00:16:34,905 --> 00:16:38,665
Speaker 4:  be a frosted glass there so that like there is

277
00:16:39,185 --> 00:16:43,065
Speaker 4:  contrast And I can read things because there are many things on top of each

278
00:16:43,065 --> 00:16:46,945
Speaker 4:  other. Like I don't need to see through my phone. Like

279
00:16:47,275 --> 00:16:51,145
Speaker 4:  maybe if I am gonna put my la tinfoil conspiracy hat

280
00:16:51,145 --> 00:16:54,625
Speaker 4:  on, maybe, you know, sometimes I'm like, yeah, I would like to see this

281
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:58,385
Speaker 4:  carefully curated picked iPhone wallpaper that I

282
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:02,425
Speaker 4:  chose for my, my home screen. I can't really see it

283
00:17:02,425 --> 00:17:06,225
Speaker 4:  most of the time. Maybe that's the thought behind liquid glass and the transparency,

284
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:10,265
Speaker 4:  having experienced the chaos. No, I was wrong, I was wrong.

285
00:17:10,465 --> 00:17:14,225
Speaker 4:  I should have a much more boring home wallpaper and a fancy lock

286
00:17:14,225 --> 00:17:18,045
Speaker 4:  screen and leave it at that. Because for me, readability is

287
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:21,965
Speaker 4:  the most important thing. I at least appreciate that I can turn some of

288
00:17:21,965 --> 00:17:25,525
Speaker 4:  this off in the accessibility settings. But I wish it was easier to find

289
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:29,005
Speaker 4:  in the accessibility settings. 'cause you gotta go, you'd think there'd be

290
00:17:29,005 --> 00:17:32,445
Speaker 4:  like a liquid glass settings menu. So you could adjust, you can't, you have

291
00:17:32,445 --> 00:17:35,085
Speaker 4:  to go through the accessibility settings and then guess which one. I think

292
00:17:35,085 --> 00:17:38,725
Speaker 3:  They need the opposite of an accessibility menu. There needs to be an option

293
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:42,405
Speaker 3:  to just ramp it way up. Everything, everything is see through

294
00:17:42,635 --> 00:17:46,325
Speaker 3:  like weird, twisted, warping glass effects everywhere. That's what I want

295
00:17:46,325 --> 00:17:46,645
Speaker 3:  from this

296
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:50,405
Speaker 5:  In a way. They almost do in that 'cause 'cause so, so one of the thing that

297
00:17:50,405 --> 00:17:54,085
Speaker 5:  came to the Mac for this is, is the, the appearance and

298
00:17:54,085 --> 00:17:58,005
Speaker 5:  theming options that were last year, I believe on the, on the iPhone,

299
00:17:58,135 --> 00:18:01,885
Speaker 5:  right? So you could pick, you can make your, your widgets, your

300
00:18:02,055 --> 00:18:05,965
Speaker 5:  icons, all like tinted colors you have, so you

301
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:09,765
Speaker 5:  have dark mode And I, I put sort of check out the, the writeup I did on it.

302
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:12,685
Speaker 5:  I, I put a bunch of comparison screenshots showing which, what it looks like

303
00:18:12,685 --> 00:18:15,965
Speaker 5:  in all these different codes of paint. And you can pick dark mode, light

304
00:18:15,965 --> 00:18:19,845
Speaker 5:  mode as of the whole os you can have like your widgets be

305
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:23,685
Speaker 5:  default dark and tinted and then tinted can be light or dark,

306
00:18:23,775 --> 00:18:27,765
Speaker 5:  right? Talk about chaos. It's a little confusing. And when you put

307
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:31,245
Speaker 5:  everything on clear, it's like, yeah, there's glassy icons everywhere

308
00:18:32,105 --> 00:18:35,885
Speaker 5:  and some stuff just looks ugly. Like I think that they could,

309
00:18:36,285 --> 00:18:40,005
Speaker 5:  I think Apple could solve this a bit by, or at least remedy this by just

310
00:18:40,005 --> 00:18:43,805
Speaker 5:  giving you some shortcut, theming options within liquid glass

311
00:18:43,805 --> 00:18:47,245
Speaker 5:  and the appearance menu. I think if they like made it where it's like this

312
00:18:47,555 --> 00:18:50,925
Speaker 5:  here like click this and you get this nice little combination that's gonna

313
00:18:51,315 --> 00:18:55,125
Speaker 5:  magnify the liquid glass effect or tone it down and in there

314
00:18:55,465 --> 00:18:59,365
Speaker 5:  should maybe even just be an off and that could activate, you know, some

315
00:18:59,365 --> 00:19:02,845
Speaker 5:  of the accessibility features that, 'cause I think if you turn off, there's

316
00:19:02,845 --> 00:19:06,805
Speaker 5:  an accessibility option called reduce transparency. And if you, if

317
00:19:06,805 --> 00:19:10,565
Speaker 5:  you activate that, it's great. That kills it. It is great, but it kills so

318
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:14,245
Speaker 5:  much of the, the look like that was initially the only way. Yes. But again,

319
00:19:14,245 --> 00:19:17,485
Speaker 5:  we're talking on the max side where it's like, you know, it's, it's, it's

320
00:19:17,485 --> 00:19:20,925
Speaker 5:  passable maybe. But if in the first

321
00:19:21,195 --> 00:19:24,445
Speaker 5:  developer beta that was there, it reduced transparency,

322
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:28,445
Speaker 5:  accessibility option was the only way you could have your menu bar filled

323
00:19:28,445 --> 00:19:32,355
Speaker 5:  in again, right? So the menu bar is the top band at the top

324
00:19:32,355 --> 00:19:36,115
Speaker 5:  of Mac os where your, you know, your file edit, view history, all that stuff

325
00:19:36,115 --> 00:19:38,035
Speaker 5:  is, and, and your icon's on the top right. And

326
00:19:39,825 --> 00:19:43,515
Speaker 5:  with it's also where on a MacBook or modern MacBooks, that's where the notch

327
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,795
Speaker 5:  is, right? So they were hiding the notch by having that filled in with a

328
00:19:46,795 --> 00:19:50,675
Speaker 5:  background. They turned the menu bar invisible, fully invisible, which

329
00:19:50,675 --> 00:19:54,235
Speaker 5:  now kind of accentuates the notch. It's not that big of a deal really. Again,

330
00:19:54,315 --> 00:19:57,835
Speaker 5:  I just, I I noticed it for like a half hour And I'm like, all right, whatever,

331
00:19:57,835 --> 00:20:01,435
Speaker 5:  it's fine. And now I'm like, now they, they, they didn't backtrack, but they

332
00:20:01,435 --> 00:20:05,235
Speaker 5:  gave the option to fill that in again, kind of the old way. Or

333
00:20:05,235 --> 00:20:07,155
Speaker 5:  you go with the new default, the new default's invisible

334
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:11,715
Speaker 5:  before you had to do the reduced transparency, but it would kill like everything

335
00:20:11,715 --> 00:20:15,355
Speaker 5:  just to get your menu bar back. So in that same way, I think they could just

336
00:20:15,455 --> 00:20:19,275
Speaker 5:  add in some options and some presets. And, And I, I, I

337
00:20:19,275 --> 00:20:22,315
Speaker 5:  hate that I'm kind of in a way like thinking like I'm actually envisioning

338
00:20:22,315 --> 00:20:25,875
Speaker 5:  like the Windows 11 theme Oh my god menu. Which I know, I know

339
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:29,755
Speaker 5:  don't wanna really, you know, say Ho Harken over to Microsoft where they're

340
00:20:29,815 --> 00:20:33,795
Speaker 5:  the bastion of no, but, but I just think that they could with a little more

341
00:20:33,795 --> 00:20:37,115
Speaker 5:  direction. 'cause like they have these pretty, you know,

342
00:20:37,345 --> 00:20:41,115
Speaker 5:  screenshots or samples on when they announce Liquid Glass

343
00:20:41,175 --> 00:20:44,835
Speaker 5:  and announce the update that show, oh, this cool, like monotone,

344
00:20:45,055 --> 00:20:48,605
Speaker 5:  you know, color combo, very aesthetic options. You can change your

345
00:20:48,985 --> 00:20:52,885
Speaker 5:  folder icon colors too and tint everything. It's

346
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:56,125
Speaker 5:  really hard to make that look good if you put the time into it. Sure. You

347
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:59,245
Speaker 5:  can make something maybe kind of cool or interesting and different. I just

348
00:20:59,245 --> 00:21:02,885
Speaker 5:  think they could guide people a little more with some fun presets or something.

349
00:21:02,985 --> 00:21:06,445
Speaker 5:  And yeah, let's turn the, the an option to turn the glass up, turn the glass

350
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:06,885
Speaker 5:  down. That

351
00:21:06,885 --> 00:21:10,205
Speaker 3:  Feels real. Like I, I actually think that it's kind of surprising to me,

352
00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:14,165
Speaker 3:  but if you look at iOS versus Android, in a lot of ways iOS has gotten way

353
00:21:14,165 --> 00:21:17,885
Speaker 3:  more customizable in terms of letting users change the look of it

354
00:21:18,185 --> 00:21:21,445
Speaker 3:  at at least the average user, right? You can go crazy on Android if you really

355
00:21:21,445 --> 00:21:25,325
Speaker 3:  want to, but you know, the, I think iOS by

356
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:29,005
Speaker 3:  default has way more theming options than my Pixel does. But

357
00:21:29,105 --> 00:21:32,365
Speaker 3:  the Pixel does try to do that thing where it picks out a few colors for you

358
00:21:32,505 --> 00:21:36,485
Speaker 3:  to make things a little bit easier. It's just isn't as enforced across the

359
00:21:36,485 --> 00:21:40,445
Speaker 3:  operating system as Apple has it. We should talk more about the Mac

360
00:21:40,445 --> 00:21:44,245
Speaker 3:  though, because I do think the Mac had some of the biggest changes in

361
00:21:44,245 --> 00:21:47,725
Speaker 3:  this release of operating systems, right?

362
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,765
Speaker 3:  It obviously Liquid Glass is the most notable one, but there's some like

363
00:21:51,765 --> 00:21:55,485
Speaker 3:  pretty big upgrades to Spotlight in particular that I think power

364
00:21:55,495 --> 00:21:59,325
Speaker 3:  users are, are pretty excited by or maybe like pissed about because it's

365
00:21:59,325 --> 00:22:02,645
Speaker 3:  like just duplicating what a lot of 'em are using Raycast for. Yeah.

366
00:22:02,645 --> 00:22:03,285
Speaker 4:  Like Raycast. Are

367
00:22:03,285 --> 00:22:04,165
Speaker 3:  There Raycast people?

368
00:22:04,885 --> 00:22:08,085
Speaker 4:  I was an Alfred person, Alfred Old School, which is not old school as like

369
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:12,765
Speaker 4:  real old school. So I know Raycast is better, but like I kind of

370
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:16,245
Speaker 4:  got rid of Alfred after a while and using Spotlight,

371
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:20,695
Speaker 4:  it's fine. It's not, it's okay.

372
00:22:20,885 --> 00:22:24,815
Speaker 4:  Like I haven't really felt super engaged by it. Like I've tried to

373
00:22:24,815 --> 00:22:28,775
Speaker 4:  use it a couple times and I'm like, I don't understand what I,

374
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,375
Speaker 4:  I'll just go back to this later and then you don't go back to it because

375
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:35,855
Speaker 4:  A DHD Yeah. But yeah, it's there. It can be

376
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:38,935
Speaker 4:  useful. I don't know Antonio, like how, how have you found it?

377
00:22:39,165 --> 00:22:42,935
Speaker 5:  Yeah, so I think, I think the spotlight changes are actually in general

378
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:46,695
Speaker 5:  all positive. They're, they're welcome changes. I was not a Raycast

379
00:22:47,085 --> 00:22:50,975
Speaker 5:  user. I, I knew I always knew of Raycast, but I just never used

380
00:22:51,095 --> 00:22:54,855
Speaker 5:  Spotlight that much. So I never thought I had much interest in it. But,

381
00:22:54,995 --> 00:22:58,855
Speaker 5:  you know, now I think the new change to Spotlight act as a nice

382
00:22:58,965 --> 00:23:02,735
Speaker 5:  on-ramp into that, whether you want to go into that world of, you know,

383
00:23:02,825 --> 00:23:06,575
Speaker 5:  crazy, you know, button combos for all kinds of stuff you can shortcut,

384
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:11,335
Speaker 5:  but it's like it's raycast light basically, and it makes sense for

385
00:23:11,335 --> 00:23:14,935
Speaker 5:  it to be more approachable. You know, if, if you go with like the

386
00:23:15,535 --> 00:23:18,895
Speaker 5:  keyboard commands, you can build this new muscle memory to do things faster.

387
00:23:19,675 --> 00:23:22,255
Speaker 5:  You know, on a Windows machine, I hit the Windows key and type it, start

388
00:23:22,255 --> 00:23:25,655
Speaker 5:  typing in an app and quickly open it. And I'm kind of used to that

389
00:23:26,075 --> 00:23:29,615
Speaker 5:  you can always use, you've been able to for a while, like use Spotlight in

390
00:23:29,615 --> 00:23:32,935
Speaker 5:  the same way, but now you can do a little further with it.

391
00:23:33,715 --> 00:23:37,575
Speaker 5:  The biggest thing for me is I a a clipboard history, right? You

392
00:23:37,575 --> 00:23:41,415
Speaker 5:  can actually for like the shortcut is you get command in

393
00:23:41,415 --> 00:23:45,205
Speaker 5:  space and then just command in number four and boom, you've got

394
00:23:45,205 --> 00:23:48,925
Speaker 5:  clipboard history and it's for the last about eight hours that you can

395
00:23:49,275 --> 00:23:53,005
Speaker 5:  copy recopy anything that you, you copied before. It could be a file, it

396
00:23:53,005 --> 00:23:56,925
Speaker 5:  could be, you know, just a, a little snippet of text. It's smart

397
00:23:56,925 --> 00:24:00,405
Speaker 5:  enough to know that if you copied like a password

398
00:24:00,865 --> 00:24:04,845
Speaker 5:  in a password field, it won't populate that. But

399
00:24:04,905 --> 00:24:08,725
Speaker 5:  if you copied that password out of plain text, I tested this just to make

400
00:24:08,725 --> 00:24:12,525
Speaker 5:  sure you should not do plain passwords in plain text, obviously,

401
00:24:12,745 --> 00:24:15,525
Speaker 5:  but then it won't know and it doesn't, it doesn't like cross reference it

402
00:24:15,525 --> 00:24:19,445
Speaker 5:  to your passwords. So yeah, it'll just be there. But that's, that's why

403
00:24:20,115 --> 00:24:23,645
Speaker 5:  it's only an eight hour limit on Raycast. Again, for those power users, you

404
00:24:23,645 --> 00:24:27,405
Speaker 5:  can have a clipboard history that's like months long Jesus if you

405
00:24:27,405 --> 00:24:31,245
Speaker 5:  want to, and you can like pin things. So like if you,

406
00:24:32,085 --> 00:24:34,885
Speaker 5:  I don't know, like always send a canned message to people or something like

407
00:24:34,885 --> 00:24:37,845
Speaker 5:  that or like are putting like, I don't know, your, your address to your shipping

408
00:24:37,845 --> 00:24:41,815
Speaker 5:  address to people pretty often or something like that. You can pin it there

409
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:45,815
Speaker 5:  and you just have it ready to go. That leads to all kinds of, or it can

410
00:24:45,815 --> 00:24:48,895
Speaker 5:  lead to all kinds of privacy concerns. Then again, if someone's in on your

411
00:24:48,895 --> 00:24:51,695
Speaker 5:  laptop and it's unlocked, they probably have access to all kinds of things.

412
00:24:52,315 --> 00:24:55,295
Speaker 5:  But no, I think overall the spotlight changes are nice. I mean, you can go

413
00:24:55,295 --> 00:24:59,015
Speaker 5:  a little deeper. You can use it with shortcuts and, and like tap

414
00:24:59,285 --> 00:25:03,175
Speaker 5:  into certain Apple Intelligence actions as well. That's

415
00:25:03,185 --> 00:25:06,895
Speaker 5:  again, like a little more extra power user stuff. I've never been like a

416
00:25:07,055 --> 00:25:10,855
Speaker 5:  shortcut sicko. Like the people that I've seen that are using it are, they're

417
00:25:10,855 --> 00:25:13,455
Speaker 5:  really into it. And I think, I think that's just gonna help them if they're

418
00:25:13,455 --> 00:25:17,375
Speaker 5:  not already in that. Like raycast, there are other options too, but

419
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:19,935
Speaker 5:  like, you know, I'm just using that as one example. But if they're already

420
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:23,655
Speaker 5:  in that world, like they maybe just don't even need, you know, those integration.

421
00:25:24,115 --> 00:25:27,575
Speaker 5:  But overall, I think the spotlight changes are nice. I think I, I wanna see,

422
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:31,575
Speaker 5:  I wanna see Apple grow this and, and make it better slowly and make it where

423
00:25:31,575 --> 00:25:35,095
Speaker 5:  that's that more approachable on ramp and yeah, there's gonna be those guardrails,

424
00:25:35,095 --> 00:25:38,775
Speaker 5:  like that eight hour time limit. I wouldn't mind them raising that a little

425
00:25:38,775 --> 00:25:42,615
Speaker 5:  bit. Maybe 18 hours, 24 hours. But yeah,

426
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:44,255
Speaker 5:  I think overall spotlight good.

427
00:25:44,415 --> 00:25:48,375
Speaker 3:  I, so I, I've bounced off Alfred and Raycast probably

428
00:25:48,415 --> 00:25:51,095
Speaker 3:  a hundred times. Like I, I write like they feel like they should be, for

429
00:25:51,095 --> 00:25:54,695
Speaker 3:  me, like in my browser, I have all

430
00:25:54,785 --> 00:25:58,735
Speaker 3:  kinds of quick search commands to like, you know,

431
00:25:58,735 --> 00:26:01,935
Speaker 3:  quickly search like The Verge or Wikipedia or all kinds of other websites.

432
00:26:02,335 --> 00:26:06,095
Speaker 3:  I find them like I could not live without them, right? But the idea

433
00:26:06,235 --> 00:26:10,015
Speaker 3:  of having like one toolbar that shortcuts across my pc, like,

434
00:26:10,455 --> 00:26:14,295
Speaker 3:  I don't know, I, it's honestly so much of my computing is just in my

435
00:26:14,295 --> 00:26:17,895
Speaker 3:  browser that I don't quite understand what the use is.

436
00:26:18,255 --> 00:26:22,225
Speaker 3:  I just like haven't been able to tap into it. And I am sort of hoping

437
00:26:22,225 --> 00:26:25,865
Speaker 3:  that maybe these spotlight changes, you know, give me a little bit more of

438
00:26:25,865 --> 00:26:29,705
Speaker 3:  that power without all the complexity. Again, those apps seem great,

439
00:26:29,845 --> 00:26:31,025
Speaker 3:  but I I they

440
00:26:31,025 --> 00:26:34,745
Speaker 4:  It just requires you to rewire your brain. Yes. And the older I get, the

441
00:26:34,745 --> 00:26:38,705
Speaker 4:  harder that is. Like the, the harder it is, the more time it takes. And I

442
00:26:38,705 --> 00:26:41,905
Speaker 4:  just go like, what was that command that I just programmed three hours ago

443
00:26:41,915 --> 00:26:45,885
Speaker 4:  again? And I will forget because I'm switching to a different platform

444
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:49,565
Speaker 4:  and a different system. So I think we sometimes have a rarefied problem,

445
00:26:50,305 --> 00:26:53,765
Speaker 4:  but if you're using the same system and you're using the same programs, like

446
00:26:53,885 --> 00:26:56,925
Speaker 4:  I think it's a little more lending itself to that process. Well,

447
00:26:57,025 --> 00:27:00,725
Speaker 3:  And I also think there's like sort of different, you know, when you're using

448
00:27:00,725 --> 00:27:03,845
Speaker 3:  something that has such a different way of interacting with it, it just like

449
00:27:03,845 --> 00:27:07,405
Speaker 3:  takes a minute. I use ARC browser Yep.

450
00:27:07,535 --> 00:27:11,445
Speaker 3:  Every single day now. And I like, could not be organized without it.

451
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:15,525
Speaker 3:  I also bounced off of it like five times and when I first use it, I'm like,

452
00:27:15,945 --> 00:27:19,885
Speaker 3:  no serious person can use this browser. Right? Like, this is for people

453
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:23,925
Speaker 3:  who do not do work, which I don't know, you know, listen, come

454
00:27:23,925 --> 00:27:27,485
Speaker 3:  at me. But you know, it is one of those things where it's like, actually

455
00:27:27,485 --> 00:27:31,445
Speaker 3:  maybe you just do need a little bit of an on-ramp. Like, so, so perhaps I

456
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:34,525
Speaker 3:  I I, it does not sound like this is the death of Raycast by any means. And

457
00:27:34,525 --> 00:27:37,525
Speaker 3:  if anything, it sounds like this is like maybe team people up to understand

458
00:27:37,915 --> 00:27:41,805
Speaker 3:  that there's more potential there. That feels like it was

459
00:27:41,965 --> 00:27:44,725
Speaker 3:  probably like that. The, the single biggest thing. I think what there's the

460
00:27:44,725 --> 00:27:47,525
Speaker 3:  games app, I dunno if anybody's using that. There's a new phone app on the

461
00:27:47,525 --> 00:27:47,725
Speaker 3:  Mac.

462
00:27:47,915 --> 00:27:48,645
Speaker 5:  Okay. The phone app.

463
00:27:48,645 --> 00:27:49,685
Speaker 3:  Are you hyped for the phone app?

464
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:53,605
Speaker 5:  Okay. It's, it's so stupid And I'm showing like, the most suburban

465
00:27:53,745 --> 00:27:57,725
Speaker 5:  dad energy right now. But like to, like, it's just, it

466
00:27:57,725 --> 00:28:01,565
Speaker 5:  was stupid how super helpful it is to just like,

467
00:28:01,675 --> 00:28:05,445
Speaker 5:  make calls to doctor's offices and like my town about

468
00:28:05,445 --> 00:28:09,245
Speaker 5:  like some documentation I had to submit or whatever. It was like,

469
00:28:09,705 --> 00:28:13,125
Speaker 5:  it just helped me a little bit to be like, oh, I, I should, I could just

470
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:16,405
Speaker 5:  do that right now. Like while I'm still, while I'm working and kind of multitask

471
00:28:16,405 --> 00:28:20,125
Speaker 5:  that as opposed to, usually I'm terrible about making those

472
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,085
Speaker 5:  annoying calls and it's like I put it off And I put it off and next thing

473
00:28:23,085 --> 00:28:26,445
Speaker 5:  I know it's five o'clock and ev all those kinds of places are closed.

474
00:28:27,465 --> 00:28:31,245
Speaker 5:  So it's, it's, it's not a big deal really. But yeah, the phone app, it operates

475
00:28:31,435 --> 00:28:35,165
Speaker 5:  just like the iOS phone app. It's totally fine and

476
00:28:35,165 --> 00:28:39,045
Speaker 5:  it's just effective. And even just like, while I'm typing and just

477
00:28:39,045 --> 00:28:42,925
Speaker 5:  doing other stuff just to like sum it up and make a quick call and I'm

478
00:28:42,925 --> 00:28:46,885
Speaker 5:  just, I'm not even like putting on headphones, earbuds, anything. I'm just

479
00:28:46,885 --> 00:28:50,805
Speaker 5:  like, just talking to my laptop and like does a good job handling

480
00:28:50,805 --> 00:28:53,725
Speaker 5:  the sound, not having echoes. No one's ever complained like, I can't hear

481
00:28:53,725 --> 00:28:57,645
Speaker 5:  you. They're perfectly clear. So yeah, phone app seems so

482
00:28:57,645 --> 00:28:59,005
Speaker 5:  in innocuous, but it's good.

483
00:28:59,205 --> 00:29:02,805
Speaker 3:  I mean, legitimately why didn't they have this forever? Right? Like, this

484
00:29:02,805 --> 00:29:06,205
Speaker 3:  is like, it's, it's like not exciting, but it is so functional. They

485
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:09,805
Speaker 4:  Had FaceTime exactly for a while, but like FaceTime, I, I don't know. I've

486
00:29:09,805 --> 00:29:12,965
Speaker 4:  always had problems switching FaceTime calls from my phone to my

487
00:29:13,935 --> 00:29:17,885
Speaker 4:  watch, to my, to my Mac. So I'm happy to hear that

488
00:29:17,885 --> 00:29:20,485
Speaker 4:  the phone app isn't as bad as that. So Yeah.

489
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:24,205
Speaker 5:  And you can even listen to your voicemails on it too. Again, I think it's

490
00:29:24,205 --> 00:29:27,965
Speaker 5:  just, it's for people. I, this, again, it's one of those things like if

491
00:29:27,965 --> 00:29:30,605
Speaker 5:  it's for people like us where it's like if you're on a computer all day,

492
00:29:31,235 --> 00:29:34,125
Speaker 5:  it's just kind of handy to have that stuff right there without, without having

493
00:29:34,145 --> 00:29:37,965
Speaker 5:  to stop what you're doing and pick up your phone to do something on the

494
00:29:37,965 --> 00:29:41,805
Speaker 5:  side, which just leads to other distractions. And I, so yeah, I

495
00:29:41,805 --> 00:29:45,645
Speaker 5:  welcome the phone app. Phone app. The games app is just,

496
00:29:45,665 --> 00:29:46,165
Speaker 5:  that's just

497
00:29:46,165 --> 00:29:48,125
Speaker 3:  Kind of, it's, I don't know why. I don't know why it exists.

498
00:29:48,595 --> 00:29:51,005
Speaker 4:  It's there. It doesn't, it would, it lets you look at the games that you

499
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:54,605
Speaker 4:  play and then you think about how you spend your time, which I spent a lot

500
00:29:54,605 --> 00:29:57,885
Speaker 4:  of time in the Sudoku app apparently. So

501
00:29:58,195 --> 00:30:01,965
Speaker 5:  It's kind of on and on A Mac on, on macOS, the games app. It actually,

502
00:30:02,025 --> 00:30:05,925
Speaker 5:  it was, it was pulling games I downloaded from Steam,

503
00:30:06,425 --> 00:30:09,725
Speaker 5:  but it was hit or miss. Like you could almost use it as a launcher for all

504
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:13,325
Speaker 5:  of your games. But how many games do you play on your Mac?

505
00:30:13,325 --> 00:30:15,525
Speaker 5:  Unfortunately, it's just, come on. It's, that's just, they're, they're

506
00:30:15,525 --> 00:30:19,285
Speaker 4:  Gonna reality a gaming happen on the Mac, they're gonna make it happen. Ray

507
00:30:19,405 --> 00:30:19,725
Speaker 4:  tracing,

508
00:30:19,915 --> 00:30:20,925
Speaker 3:  It's so aspirational.

509
00:30:23,205 --> 00:30:27,085
Speaker 5:  I want them to, I, I actually, I, I genuinely want them to, like, when I

510
00:30:27,965 --> 00:30:31,685
Speaker 5:  reviewed the most recent like M four Max MacBook Pro, I'm just like,

511
00:30:32,065 --> 00:30:34,965
Speaker 5:  I'm sorry, I'm, I have to say like, the elephant in the room is like, it

512
00:30:34,965 --> 00:30:38,885
Speaker 5:  would be so nice for someone who's like creative, like people I work with,

513
00:30:38,885 --> 00:30:42,725
Speaker 5:  like photographers I work with that buy these kinds of like, heavy duty

514
00:30:42,835 --> 00:30:46,725
Speaker 5:  Macs for like a Mac studio or a MacBook Pro. Like, they would like to

515
00:30:47,005 --> 00:30:49,805
Speaker 5:  actually play games on them. And it's like, but ultimately, like they're

516
00:30:49,805 --> 00:30:53,525
Speaker 5:  just, it's just still not enough. If, if they, if Apple could really get

517
00:30:53,525 --> 00:30:57,285
Speaker 5:  their, get their stuff together with like a proton layer,

518
00:30:57,395 --> 00:31:00,405
Speaker 5:  like setup, like I know they have their game toolkit,

519
00:31:01,225 --> 00:31:04,765
Speaker 5:  but it's not the porting toolkit, but it's not fully there. Obviously you

520
00:31:04,765 --> 00:31:08,725
Speaker 5:  need developers to, to, you know, sign on. But like, I don't know, man, just

521
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:12,805
Speaker 5:  try with more developers than like Aade Kajima and like Capcom

522
00:31:13,425 --> 00:31:17,165
Speaker 5:  and I guess now CD Project Red again. Cool. Cyberpunk on on the Mac.

523
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:20,885
Speaker 5:  Cool. But you know, again, so the games app is just like,

524
00:31:20,915 --> 00:31:24,885
Speaker 3:  It's rough when Nintendo beats you to cyberpunk. That's that,

525
00:31:24,955 --> 00:31:28,765
Speaker 3:  yeah. Could not have foreseen that. Okay. VI wanna make sure I

526
00:31:28,925 --> 00:31:32,885
Speaker 3:  I I ask you about watchOS 26.

527
00:31:32,915 --> 00:31:35,925
Speaker 3:  Yeah. There's a, a new fitness coach. What is

528
00:31:35,925 --> 00:31:39,685
Speaker 4:  This there? So, you know, apple Intelligence, right at, at

529
00:31:39,705 --> 00:31:43,605
Speaker 4:  dub dub, they were just like, it's on our ecosystem of devices, of course,

530
00:31:43,605 --> 00:31:46,765
Speaker 4:  because, you know, watch got left out last year, you know, didn't have Apple

531
00:31:46,765 --> 00:31:50,725
Speaker 4:  Intelligence on the watch last year. Now they're like, yo, apple

532
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:54,525
Speaker 4:  Intelligence, it's on the watch this year and Workout Buddy.

533
00:31:54,925 --> 00:31:58,085
Speaker 3:  I don't know if, I don't know if that's like a threat or an upgrade.

534
00:31:58,755 --> 00:31:59,045
Speaker 3:  It's

535
00:31:59,805 --> 00:32:02,925
Speaker 4:  A thing. It is, yes, it is a thing. So like in the, in the keynote

536
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:06,765
Speaker 4:  and the sizzle reel for Workout Buddy, you see this woman and she's running

537
00:32:06,905 --> 00:32:10,405
Speaker 4:  and the workout buddy's just like, nice,

538
00:32:10,475 --> 00:32:14,165
Speaker 4:  crushed the pace. And you know, the, the thing that happened

539
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:18,445
Speaker 4:  to my phone in real time while I was in that watching the

540
00:32:18,445 --> 00:32:20,885
Speaker 4:  keynote was people going like, am I gonna hate this? Am I gonna hate the,

541
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:24,325
Speaker 4:  what's going on? Am I gonna get yelled at by an ai? You are not going to

542
00:32:24,325 --> 00:32:26,965
Speaker 4:  get yelled at by an ai? It's actually kind of like

543
00:32:28,215 --> 00:32:31,275
Speaker 4:  not really there for a lot of workouts.

544
00:32:31,985 --> 00:32:34,035
Speaker 4:  It's, so the, the thing that's AI is it

545
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,515
Speaker 3:  Is this like Spotify's AI dj where every once in a while it's just like

546
00:32:37,815 --> 00:32:41,645
Speaker 3:  Yo v good pace, kinda kind of, it's, and

547
00:32:41,645 --> 00:32:43,525
Speaker 3:  you're like, oh, like I didn't need this. But

548
00:32:43,915 --> 00:32:47,645
Speaker 4:  Yeah, it's kind of like that. So basically the AI elements of it,

549
00:32:47,905 --> 00:32:51,605
Speaker 4:  you do need to have an iPhone that is capable of Apple

550
00:32:51,605 --> 00:32:55,365
Speaker 4:  intelligence, which is why I needed two iPhones to, to basically

551
00:32:55,595 --> 00:32:56,445
Speaker 4:  test this Beta

552
00:32:56,745 --> 00:33:00,645
Speaker 3:  VK office today. She's like got got a light day, only two phones on

553
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,325
Speaker 3:  me, only two phones on me and only two watchOS on you. This is, yeah,

554
00:33:03,325 --> 00:33:06,365
Speaker 4:  Only two watchOS on me. Well, there's only one for each wrist. But you know,

555
00:33:06,645 --> 00:33:09,645
Speaker 4:  I have been carrying around three phones for the last couple of weeks. Like

556
00:33:09,725 --> 00:33:13,565
Speaker 4:  a psycho because I need it. My, my main iPhone is a 14

557
00:33:13,585 --> 00:33:17,525
Speaker 4:  Provac does not have the Apple Intelligence features, therefore I could not

558
00:33:17,525 --> 00:33:21,485
Speaker 4:  test workout buddy on the watch that was paired to that. I needed

559
00:33:21,505 --> 00:33:25,485
Speaker 4:  an i my iPhone 16, which was paired to a different Apple watch

560
00:33:25,485 --> 00:33:25,685
Speaker 3:  Oh

561
00:33:25,685 --> 00:33:29,565
Speaker 4:  Dear. Just to test workout buddy. So that's my dedication

562
00:33:29,985 --> 00:33:33,885
Speaker 4:  to all of you. But Workout Buddy basically

563
00:33:34,585 --> 00:33:38,005
Speaker 4:  has three voices that are trained on the Apple Fitness Plus

564
00:33:38,035 --> 00:33:41,685
Speaker 4:  trainer's voices. So you can choose your version of peppy,

565
00:33:42,925 --> 00:33:46,565
Speaker 4:  a peppy voice in your ear, and then when you go on an

566
00:33:46,565 --> 00:33:49,525
Speaker 4:  equivalent or like not an equivalent, when you go on an eligible workout,

567
00:33:49,705 --> 00:33:53,565
Speaker 4:  you're gonna get a little summary at the beginning where it's just

568
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:57,045
Speaker 4:  like, Hey, ve you're about to go on an outdoor walk. That's great.

569
00:33:57,315 --> 00:34:01,125
Speaker 4:  Love that for you. You are kind of ahead where you would be

570
00:34:01,585 --> 00:34:05,365
Speaker 4:  at this time of day for your rings in terms of closing it, go and

571
00:34:05,365 --> 00:34:08,765
Speaker 4:  crash it. And then depending on the workout that you're doing,

572
00:34:09,225 --> 00:34:13,165
Speaker 4:  you may get motivational tidbits in the actual

573
00:34:13,605 --> 00:34:16,245
Speaker 4:  workout itself. So if you're going on a walk, you ain't gonna hear shit.

574
00:34:16,645 --> 00:34:20,565
Speaker 4:  But if you're on a run, on a run at the mile pace, it's

575
00:34:20,565 --> 00:34:24,365
Speaker 4:  like you crush that mile and insert pace here. You were listening to

576
00:34:24,365 --> 00:34:27,245
Speaker 4:  Stray Kids when that happened. Love that for you. Keep going.

577
00:34:28,305 --> 00:34:32,205
Speaker 4:  And then if you hit a PR or a milestone like that was your

578
00:34:32,205 --> 00:34:36,045
Speaker 4:  hundredth mile of the year, love that for you. And that

579
00:34:36,045 --> 00:34:40,005
Speaker 4:  happens. And then at the end of the, the workout,

580
00:34:40,065 --> 00:34:43,885
Speaker 4:  you basically get a, you did great, you totally closed

581
00:34:43,955 --> 00:34:47,045
Speaker 4:  your ring And I love this for you. And that's workout buddy.

582
00:34:47,235 --> 00:34:50,445
Speaker 3:  This feels like, like upbeat and pleasant but not

583
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,125
Speaker 3:  helpful. Is that like

584
00:34:52,635 --> 00:34:54,405
Speaker 4:  It's, it's okay. I like,

585
00:34:54,405 --> 00:34:57,245
Speaker 3:  This is exactly how I feel about Spotify dj. Yeah. Where I'm like, I don't

586
00:34:57,245 --> 00:35:01,125
Speaker 3:  know why this AI voice is talking to me. This like, this is

587
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:04,645
Speaker 3:  just a playlist, but it's actually there's less music. Yeah. Like,

588
00:35:05,275 --> 00:35:08,845
Speaker 3:  okay, it's fun, it's fun. I'm like, I did just listen to that song.

589
00:35:08,845 --> 00:35:12,485
Speaker 4:  Yeah, no, apple told me that the idea was to bring more delight and

590
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:15,525
Speaker 4:  motivation into the workouts. Yeah. 'cause let's, let's face it, working

591
00:35:15,545 --> 00:35:17,765
Speaker 4:  out kind of sucks. Like it honestly, it just

592
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:22,005
Speaker 3:  Does. Listen, I've never wanted an AI therapist, but a while

593
00:35:22,005 --> 00:35:25,445
Speaker 3:  I'm working out is the time. I've never, I'm never happy when I'm working

594
00:35:25,465 --> 00:35:29,005
Speaker 3:  out. And if somebody could work through that with me, you know, it's, I think

595
00:35:29,005 --> 00:35:29,365
Speaker 3:  that might,

596
00:35:29,715 --> 00:35:33,085
Speaker 4:  It's not the worst thing in the world. It can be a little chatty. You do

597
00:35:33,085 --> 00:35:36,725
Speaker 4:  have the option to turn it off. Is it better than

598
00:35:36,775 --> 00:35:40,765
Speaker 4:  other, you know, workout apps that have had voices like telling you

599
00:35:40,785 --> 00:35:44,765
Speaker 4:  to pick up the pace or to do whatever, not particularly, but

600
00:35:44,765 --> 00:35:48,605
Speaker 4:  it does have more of your historical data. What I wish it would do was it'd

601
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:52,285
Speaker 4:  be like, Hey, you are going pretty fast on this first mile that you have

602
00:35:52,285 --> 00:35:55,965
Speaker 4:  planned out. Right now it is 86 degrees out with 92%

603
00:35:56,205 --> 00:35:59,765
Speaker 4:  humidity. Slow it down girl. You're fine. Like that's what I would love.

604
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:03,645
Speaker 4:  Yes. From that. And it's not an AI chat bot, it's not any of that

605
00:36:03,645 --> 00:36:04,325
Speaker 4:  sort of thing. So,

606
00:36:04,945 --> 00:36:07,885
Speaker 3:  Eh, this is the thing. It's just so, it's like not even V one, it's like

607
00:36:07,925 --> 00:36:11,445
Speaker 3:  VV zero, right? None of them actually have the data yet to

608
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:12,885
Speaker 3:  sell you the smart thing.

609
00:36:13,355 --> 00:36:17,245
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Or like the really smart thing, there's, it's just like one, yeah.

610
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:21,325
Speaker 4:  Or like one and a half turns short of where I would like really find it helpful

611
00:36:21,385 --> 00:36:25,005
Speaker 4:  and useful. But as far as like a motivational thing goes, it's fine.

612
00:36:25,385 --> 00:36:28,045
Speaker 3:  Can you talk to it? Like, can you talk back to it and like, no, you can't

613
00:36:28,045 --> 00:36:28,245
Speaker 3:  talk back to it.

614
00:36:28,245 --> 00:36:31,365
Speaker 4:  Okay. So like that's the, that's kind of like the disconnect where, you know

615
00:36:31,475 --> 00:36:35,365
Speaker 4:  Yeah. Like is it actually ai? Well, yes, but not

616
00:36:35,365 --> 00:36:39,165
Speaker 4:  in the way that you're probably thinking, but pretty on par for where fitness

617
00:36:39,505 --> 00:36:43,125
Speaker 4:  AI is in general at this point. But they like marketed this

618
00:36:43,345 --> 00:36:47,205
Speaker 4:  as the big marquee thing of watchOS 26.

619
00:36:47,395 --> 00:36:51,005
Speaker 4:  What I think the real star of

620
00:36:51,235 --> 00:36:55,125
Speaker 4:  watchOS 26 is, is the wrist flick and or the flippy flip

621
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:58,925
Speaker 4:  because we have the pinchy pinch. Yes. Coined by The Verge Dan Seaford

622
00:36:59,825 --> 00:37:03,405
Speaker 4:  for the double tap, which is the gesture that lets you just like go through

623
00:37:03,665 --> 00:37:07,285
Speaker 4:  the, the, the widget menus. If wake up there, there we go. And this watch

624
00:37:07,285 --> 00:37:10,525
Speaker 4:  wake up so you can double pinch and you can go through all that stuff. That's

625
00:37:10,525 --> 00:37:13,805
Speaker 4:  pretty good. Now you have the flippy flip or the wrist flick where you just

626
00:37:14,115 --> 00:37:17,405
Speaker 4:  dismiss stuff. That's good. So if you have notifications that come in and

627
00:37:17,405 --> 00:37:20,085
Speaker 4:  you're just busy, you can just go like that and it'll dismiss it for you.

628
00:37:20,465 --> 00:37:20,925
Speaker 4:  So you can,

629
00:37:21,465 --> 00:37:24,485
Speaker 3:  That's actually like legitimately huge. So like with a software update, like

630
00:37:24,485 --> 00:37:28,045
Speaker 3:  add like an entire new like button effectively. Like that's, that's,

631
00:37:28,225 --> 00:37:28,645
Speaker 3:  that's

632
00:37:28,645 --> 00:37:30,805
Speaker 4:  Very cool because you're, you're, you're out and about. You got, you got

633
00:37:30,805 --> 00:37:33,925
Speaker 4:  stuff going on. You're like, I can't take this boop, it's gone. You're like,

634
00:37:33,925 --> 00:37:37,685
Speaker 4:  woo. Love that. Love that. Yeah. And then the other thing is the smart stack

635
00:37:37,745 --> 00:37:41,005
Speaker 4:  now has a little icon. So the smart stack is like, I bring up this little

636
00:37:41,005 --> 00:37:44,605
Speaker 4:  widget menu. There's all these widgets, it'll surface the most relevant thing

637
00:37:44,605 --> 00:37:48,405
Speaker 4:  to you and that moment. And there's a little icon. So when I was taking

638
00:37:48,485 --> 00:37:51,685
Speaker 4:  a picture for the thing, it was like a little icon of my camera so I could

639
00:37:51,685 --> 00:37:54,565
Speaker 4:  bring up the remote, the camera remote on this thing.

640
00:37:56,865 --> 00:37:59,285
Speaker 3:  And can I tell you something? That's great. I think Liquid Glass looks all

641
00:37:59,285 --> 00:38:00,325
Speaker 3:  right on the watch. It does,

642
00:38:00,715 --> 00:38:02,765
Speaker 4:  It's fine on the watch, it's on the phone.

643
00:38:03,165 --> 00:38:06,365
Speaker 3:  'cause again, you don't notice it. Yeah. It's just so it's on the song. So

644
00:38:06,365 --> 00:38:09,525
Speaker 3:  discreet. It's so interesting. 'cause Liquid glass is like the big splashy

645
00:38:09,525 --> 00:38:12,685
Speaker 3:  feature that everybody's paying attention to. But there are so many actual

646
00:38:12,685 --> 00:38:15,285
Speaker 3:  like, powerful functional updates. And the one we haven't talked about yet

647
00:38:15,505 --> 00:38:19,245
Speaker 3:  is on the iPad where you can now have free floating windows.

648
00:38:19,655 --> 00:38:23,525
Speaker 3:  Right. It's not the weird stage manager thing anymore where Apple will

649
00:38:23,725 --> 00:38:27,205
Speaker 3:  control the windows for you. Which I think is like very

650
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:30,845
Speaker 3:  delightful that they spent years building this alternate

651
00:38:31,005 --> 00:38:34,685
Speaker 3:  multitasking system. 'cause they're like, we cannot, the people can't handle

652
00:38:34,685 --> 00:38:38,605
Speaker 3:  windows. Windows are too much for them. We have

653
00:38:38,605 --> 00:38:42,525
Speaker 3:  to control the windows for them. And finally, finally they're just like,

654
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:45,945
Speaker 3:  all right, let's see what happens. Let's go crazy. It's great. And they have,

655
00:38:45,945 --> 00:38:49,305
Speaker 3:  there's a mouse, there's a mouse pointer on the iPad. Now they, before that

656
00:38:49,305 --> 00:38:53,265
Speaker 3:  this, they were like, they can have a circle. You're

657
00:38:53,265 --> 00:38:56,345
Speaker 3:  like, mouse, that doesn't exist A pointer. No, I think

658
00:38:56,345 --> 00:38:59,745
Speaker 4:  It's, you know, 'cause it's really funny because this is the thing that everyone

659
00:38:59,765 --> 00:39:03,465
Speaker 4:  has wanted for iPad to be more like a Mac because of,

660
00:39:03,565 --> 00:39:07,545
Speaker 4:  you know, there's always someone who's like, oh, I wanna use my iPad as

661
00:39:07,585 --> 00:39:11,225
Speaker 4:  a Mac because I don't actually want to buy a Mac because money and price

662
00:39:11,225 --> 00:39:14,665
Speaker 4:  points and whatever reason. And they finally gave it to us.

663
00:39:15,635 --> 00:39:16,935
Speaker 4:  And I was just like,

664
00:39:19,205 --> 00:39:22,005
Speaker 4:  I still don't know if this this is gonna work. But I love that it's

665
00:39:22,005 --> 00:39:25,805
Speaker 3:  There. The thing that drives me crazy is I think that Apple's like hardware

666
00:39:25,805 --> 00:39:29,685
Speaker 3:  innovation has leaned so heavily on the iPhone iPad side of the house.

667
00:39:30,025 --> 00:39:33,885
Speaker 3:  And the Mac has lagged behind in some ways, not talking about the

668
00:39:33,885 --> 00:39:37,845
Speaker 3:  processors, but like the like functional extra features, right? On

669
00:39:37,845 --> 00:39:41,285
Speaker 3:  the, if you look at the iPad Pro, right? You've got

670
00:39:41,555 --> 00:39:45,485
Speaker 3:  this great front facing camera, you've got face id, you've got

671
00:39:45,485 --> 00:39:48,085
Speaker 3:  all, all these rear cameras with lidar. I don't even want this.

672
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:52,285
Speaker 3:  And I think the operating system is, is just very lovely to use in a lot

673
00:39:52,285 --> 00:39:56,125
Speaker 3:  of ways. It has a touch screen. But the problem is that

674
00:39:56,825 --> 00:40:00,765
Speaker 3:  the iPad software has not allowed you to use it like a laptop. Right?

675
00:40:00,785 --> 00:40:04,645
Speaker 3:  So every time that I'm looking and saying I need to buy a new main

676
00:40:05,005 --> 00:40:08,525
Speaker 3:  computer, it's always gonna be a Mac for me, right? Because it just can do

677
00:40:08,725 --> 00:40:12,565
Speaker 3:  things in a, in a regular way for all tasks. And the

678
00:40:12,635 --> 00:40:16,045
Speaker 3:  iPad is like maybe finally getting there and we'll see. Right? There are

679
00:40:16,045 --> 00:40:19,405
Speaker 3:  still limitations. It's funny, I like plugged my iPad into my

680
00:40:19,635 --> 00:40:23,525
Speaker 3:  monitor slash dock last night and it's like, oh, the wireless mouse

681
00:40:23,525 --> 00:40:26,965
Speaker 3:  doesn't work. 'cause it docked through the monitor and it's like, look, these

682
00:40:26,965 --> 00:40:30,805
Speaker 3:  are like, you know, minor extraneous things, right? But

683
00:40:30,805 --> 00:40:33,645
Speaker 3:  that, you know, the iPad is finally getting background tasks. It finally

684
00:40:33,705 --> 00:40:36,885
Speaker 3:  has windowing and it's like, okay, maybe I can actually use this as a computer.

685
00:40:37,225 --> 00:40:41,165
Speaker 3:  And is really nice to see the power of the Mac increasingly

686
00:40:41,165 --> 00:40:44,885
Speaker 3:  coming to the iPad so that you have an option if you are somebody who, like

687
00:40:44,885 --> 00:40:48,165
Speaker 3:  me is like a big hardware nerd and like wants to get all the cool features,

688
00:40:48,795 --> 00:40:52,405
Speaker 4:  Give the people what they want. That's just what they should do. And the

689
00:40:52,405 --> 00:40:56,005
Speaker 4:  people have been wanting, this would be nice, this for iPadOS for ages at

690
00:40:56,005 --> 00:40:57,685
Speaker 4:  this point. So yay.

691
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:01,445
Speaker 5:  Give them windowing on an iPad and give them a touchscreen Mac and then

692
00:41:01,905 --> 00:41:05,805
Speaker 5:  people will be, I mean the buttons have, for years, the buttons on the Mac

693
00:41:05,995 --> 00:41:09,605
Speaker 5:  have gotten more and more touch looking, touch friendly and liquid glass

694
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:12,485
Speaker 5:  is just even furthering that. Again, look at that control center on Tahoe.

695
00:41:13,465 --> 00:41:17,005
Speaker 5:  You know, so this could maybe, maybe that they

696
00:41:17,315 --> 00:41:19,365
Speaker 5:  very, very slowly converging. Just make the into a

697
00:41:19,365 --> 00:41:21,005
Speaker 4:  Circle. Yeah. And people will be happy

698
00:41:21,275 --> 00:41:22,085
Speaker 3:  Antonio, for some reason

699
00:41:22,175 --> 00:41:24,325
Speaker 5:  It'll take 10 more years probably. But maybe

700
00:41:24,475 --> 00:41:28,165
Speaker 3:  It's so funny, Todd Haton wrote for our website about iPadOS

701
00:41:28,805 --> 00:41:32,445
Speaker 3:  26 beta and he talks about the, the stoplight

702
00:41:32,445 --> 00:41:36,325
Speaker 3:  buttons in the, the corner. And he's like, yeah, when my finger gets close

703
00:41:36,385 --> 00:41:39,605
Speaker 3:  to the tiny button on the iPad, it just gets bigger and then I can touch

704
00:41:39,605 --> 00:41:43,485
Speaker 3:  it. And he is like, apple has no excuses to not just put a touchscreen

705
00:41:43,705 --> 00:41:47,325
Speaker 3:  on the Mac. Like they solved it. They like, it's, it's, it's easy. It's doable.

706
00:41:47,325 --> 00:41:50,965
Speaker 3:  They figured it out. Like, let's, let's make it happen. Give the people

707
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:53,845
Speaker 3:  what they want. Give 'em what they want.

708
00:41:55,695 --> 00:41:58,645
Speaker 3:  We'll get there. We'll get there someday. Alright, we've gotta take a break.

709
00:41:58,915 --> 00:42:01,965
Speaker 3:  Antonio, thanks for joining us for this segment. When we get back, we'll

710
00:42:01,965 --> 00:42:05,685
Speaker 3:  have VERGE Transportation editor Andy Hawkins and Eater

711
00:42:05,835 --> 00:42:09,005
Speaker 3:  LA's Matthew Kang to join us to talk about Elon

712
00:43:27,225 --> 00:43:30,805
Speaker 3:  All right, we're back. We've got some new people in the studio. Joining me

713
00:43:30,805 --> 00:43:34,685
Speaker 3:  in ve is VERGE Transportation editor Andy Hawkins. Hello. And joining us

714
00:43:34,685 --> 00:43:38,285
Speaker 3:  from La Eater's, lead editor for Southern California, Matthew Kang.

715
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:39,045
Speaker 3:  Hey, how

716
00:43:39,045 --> 00:43:39,165
Speaker 7:  Are

717
00:43:39,165 --> 00:43:41,845
Speaker 3:  You? Good. Thanks for joining us. I'm really excited to talk about this.

718
00:43:42,475 --> 00:43:46,245
Speaker 3:  This is is sort of a surprising one, right? So

719
00:43:46,245 --> 00:43:50,005
Speaker 3:  Tesla, it's had a weird week, right? They just had their

720
00:43:50,005 --> 00:43:53,805
Speaker 3:  largest revenue drop in years, which is not like great news to share. Yeah.

721
00:43:53,945 --> 00:43:57,565
Speaker 3:  And the same week they announced that they opened a restaurant, which is

722
00:43:57,565 --> 00:44:00,645
Speaker 3:  like, I maybe not what their investors are asking for, maybe not what their

723
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:04,685
Speaker 3:  customers are asking for, but is, you know, more positive news,

724
00:44:05,045 --> 00:44:08,085
Speaker 3:  I guess Andy, like what is the state of Tesla? Because I feel like it has

725
00:44:08,085 --> 00:44:11,885
Speaker 3:  been very like frantic since Musk stopped

726
00:44:11,935 --> 00:44:15,725
Speaker 3:  doing Doge and went back to work, right? There's been the robo taxii,

727
00:44:16,995 --> 00:44:20,685
Speaker 3:  there's diner, how Yes. But how,

728
00:44:20,785 --> 00:44:21,925
Speaker 3:  how are things over

729
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:25,885
Speaker 7:  There? It's, it's been a, it's been a crazy half year for this

730
00:44:25,885 --> 00:44:29,445
Speaker 7:  company, but no, yeah. The, the diner announcement was very

731
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:34,965
Speaker 7:  interestingly timed. I wanna say like, I feel like it opened at

732
00:44:35,285 --> 00:44:38,645
Speaker 7:  right before this earnings. I, I don't wanna suggest that that was strategically

733
00:44:38,645 --> 00:44:42,485
Speaker 7:  done this way, but it certainly seems to have been intended

734
00:44:42,545 --> 00:44:45,925
Speaker 7:  to like, kind of like overshadow the incredibly bad news in this earnings

735
00:44:45,925 --> 00:44:48,805
Speaker 7:  report, right? Like you have this shiny new diner that's opening up

736
00:44:49,945 --> 00:44:52,045
Speaker 7:  and, and you know, like, I can't wait to hear what Matthew has to say about

737
00:44:52,045 --> 00:44:55,565
Speaker 7:  it, but it's just like, you know, the timing right on the heels, right before

738
00:44:56,595 --> 00:44:59,765
Speaker 7:  this, this horrible earnings report just seems really convenient

739
00:45:00,985 --> 00:45:03,685
Speaker 7:  is all I'll say to start out with. But yeah, no terrible earnings report.

740
00:45:04,615 --> 00:45:08,445
Speaker 7:  Third consecutive drop in revenue

741
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:12,245
Speaker 7:  and earnings and sales and, and it's getting worse. Why? Worse?

742
00:45:12,245 --> 00:45:15,285
Speaker 3:  Worse. Why are they falling apart? Because I, I thought these cars are wild

743
00:45:15,285 --> 00:45:15,765
Speaker 7:  Popular, Jake.

744
00:45:16,025 --> 00:45:17,445
Speaker 3:  No, they're not. They're

745
00:45:17,665 --> 00:45:21,445
Speaker 4:  Not. I have a car guy for a spouse and they are not well put

746
00:45:21,605 --> 00:45:22,205
Speaker 4:  together. They're,

747
00:45:22,205 --> 00:45:24,165
Speaker 7:  They're, that, that's a whole, that's

748
00:45:24,165 --> 00:45:25,565
Speaker 4:  A whole other issue. That's a whole,

749
00:45:26,065 --> 00:45:29,805
Speaker 7:  The, the quality of Tesla's vehicles has been a long like simmering problem

750
00:45:29,825 --> 00:45:33,045
Speaker 7:  for, for that. But the, the problems the company is currently facing

751
00:45:34,595 --> 00:45:37,525
Speaker 7:  have, you know, everything to do with sort of the Elon of it all, as we like

752
00:45:37,525 --> 00:45:40,725
Speaker 7:  to say on staff, right? Like, you know, he came out in support of Trump last

753
00:45:40,725 --> 00:45:44,485
Speaker 7:  year. He spent $300 million to get him elected. Then he took over Doge

754
00:45:44,545 --> 00:45:48,205
Speaker 7:  and he made some fascist hand gestures and, you know,

755
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:52,605
Speaker 7:  everything that's been going on up until this point. And then we saw the

756
00:45:52,605 --> 00:45:56,205
Speaker 7:  Tesla take down protests. Mm. And, you know, sort of a very

757
00:45:56,205 --> 00:46:00,125
Speaker 7:  concerted effort by people who were very, you know, concerned

758
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:03,165
Speaker 7:  about the direction this country is going in. And they decided to, to, you

759
00:46:03,485 --> 00:46:06,605
Speaker 7:  know, organize around protesting Tesla, boycotting

760
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:10,925
Speaker 7:  trying to, you know, basically make the, the, the brand toxic. And

761
00:46:11,125 --> 00:46:15,005
Speaker 7:  I would say that they have been successful in, in that as, as

762
00:46:15,905 --> 00:46:19,125
Speaker 7:  you know, as we've seen in these earnings. So you, Tesla, right now they're

763
00:46:19,125 --> 00:46:22,685
Speaker 7:  in what's called double digit territory, where they are down the

764
00:46:22,685 --> 00:46:26,365
Speaker 7:  revenue's down double digits, their profits are down double digits and their

765
00:46:26,365 --> 00:46:29,445
Speaker 7:  and their sales are down double digits. And that's just not a good place

766
00:46:29,445 --> 00:46:30,725
Speaker 7:  to be for a company like that. Mm.

767
00:46:30,915 --> 00:46:33,445
Speaker 3:  This is, this is really nerdy, but there's this thing in your story that

768
00:46:33,445 --> 00:46:37,085
Speaker 3:  you kept talking about where they have this regulatory credits problem that

769
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:40,805
Speaker 3:  like, seems to be sort of one of Elon's own making too,

770
00:46:41,175 --> 00:46:44,205
Speaker 3:  which is can you tell me like what are these credits and what are, what is

771
00:46:44,205 --> 00:46:45,125
Speaker 3:  it about to fall apart here?

772
00:46:45,315 --> 00:46:48,765
Speaker 7:  Yeah, the credit situation is really fascinating because it's, it's really

773
00:46:48,785 --> 00:46:52,005
Speaker 7:  an under-discussed aspect of Tesla's success over the years.

774
00:46:52,905 --> 00:46:56,885
Speaker 7:  So we have, you know, in the United States something called the cafe

775
00:46:57,165 --> 00:47:00,685
Speaker 7:  standards where automakers need to meet a certain threshold

776
00:47:01,305 --> 00:47:05,285
Speaker 7:  for emissions sort of across their fleet, right? And

777
00:47:05,285 --> 00:47:09,165
Speaker 7:  so the idea is that, you know, if you increase emission standards, cars get,

778
00:47:09,665 --> 00:47:13,525
Speaker 7:  use less gasoline emit less carbon emissions, less pollution, and we're better

779
00:47:13,525 --> 00:47:17,285
Speaker 7:  off as a society. And so for many, many years, Tesla is an

780
00:47:17,285 --> 00:47:21,165
Speaker 7:  exclusively electric vehicle company, has no emissions across its fleet.

781
00:47:21,385 --> 00:47:25,205
Speaker 7:  So they were earning these, they were able to sell these credits that they

782
00:47:25,205 --> 00:47:28,765
Speaker 7:  were earning for the, from the government to other automakers that have a

783
00:47:28,765 --> 00:47:32,285
Speaker 7:  mi more of a mix of, of gas burning vehicles and electric vehicles, mostly

784
00:47:32,385 --> 00:47:35,005
Speaker 7:  gas burning vehicles. So they would sell their credits to companies like

785
00:47:35,005 --> 00:47:38,805
Speaker 7:  Ford and GM and Dodge and Chrysler and all these other ones.

786
00:47:39,345 --> 00:47:43,005
Speaker 7:  And that was a huge, huge, huge source of revenue for the company.

787
00:47:43,145 --> 00:47:46,645
Speaker 7:  One that has not, you know, you think of Tesla as a successful company based

788
00:47:46,645 --> 00:47:49,965
Speaker 7:  solely on the fact that they make these electric cars that people like, well

789
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:53,925
Speaker 7:  actually they, I think for the past decade alone have been earning

790
00:47:53,925 --> 00:47:57,445
Speaker 7:  around $11 billion from regulatory credit sales.

791
00:47:57,545 --> 00:48:01,405
Speaker 7:  11 billion. 11 billion. And last year it was like two and a half billion

792
00:48:01,405 --> 00:48:05,005
Speaker 7:  dollars, which made up almost 50% of the company's

793
00:48:05,035 --> 00:48:08,965
Speaker 7:  overall net income or profit essentially. Incredible. So half of their

794
00:48:08,965 --> 00:48:12,805
Speaker 7:  profit came from the sale of these regulatory credits that's about to

795
00:48:12,805 --> 00:48:16,685
Speaker 7:  go away because Donald Trump and the Republicans decided that this is not

796
00:48:16,805 --> 00:48:18,485
Speaker 7:  a good thing anymore and they're gonna get rid of it.

797
00:48:18,625 --> 00:48:22,565
Speaker 3:  It, it's just so rough where it, it, it really does feel like so much of

798
00:48:22,915 --> 00:48:26,685
Speaker 3:  Tesla's challenge right now is of Elon's own making. Right? He

799
00:48:26,715 --> 00:48:30,525
Speaker 3:  made cars that people like and then he made people not, at least

800
00:48:30,705 --> 00:48:34,605
Speaker 3:  he made the people who really like electric cars. Yes. Right. A good chunk

801
00:48:34,605 --> 00:48:38,445
Speaker 3:  of that segment, not like him. And then he helped elect the people

802
00:48:38,445 --> 00:48:42,085
Speaker 3:  who are gonna get rid of the money flowing to environmental causes.

803
00:48:42,745 --> 00:48:46,645
Speaker 3:  And so, you know, now he's just gotta be an automaker and compete

804
00:48:46,645 --> 00:48:47,765
Speaker 3:  on that and like, it,

805
00:48:47,765 --> 00:48:51,725
Speaker 7:  It, it really cannot be underemphasized the amount

806
00:48:51,825 --> 00:48:55,405
Speaker 7:  of, of of face plant that this is for. So like, this is a

807
00:48:55,685 --> 00:48:59,485
Speaker 7:  historic level face plant for a human being. Like to

808
00:48:59,655 --> 00:49:03,565
Speaker 7:  spend $300 million to get one guy elected and have that guy come into

809
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:07,525
Speaker 7:  office doing exactly what he said he was gonna do during the campaign,

810
00:49:07,615 --> 00:49:10,725
Speaker 7:  which was eliminate all these incentives and credits and all of these things

811
00:49:11,145 --> 00:49:15,045
Speaker 7:  and, and have that have be such a negative effect weighing down your own

812
00:49:15,045 --> 00:49:18,465
Speaker 7:  company. And that is the primary source of his wealth

813
00:49:18,995 --> 00:49:22,745
Speaker 7:  popularity, you know, his status, his reputation, it, I mean,

814
00:49:22,925 --> 00:49:26,265
Speaker 7:  you know, SpaceX and, and whatnot. But Tesla is really, like, that's the,

815
00:49:26,525 --> 00:49:28,105
Speaker 7:  that's the money bags for him. So,

816
00:49:28,525 --> 00:49:32,265
Speaker 3:  So I'll say like, the one thing that you can't knock Elon for is his ability

817
00:49:32,285 --> 00:49:35,865
Speaker 3:  to do maybe like too many things at once, not always,

818
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:40,545
Speaker 3:  you know, to the, their full potential. The Robax rollout has

819
00:49:40,545 --> 00:49:44,465
Speaker 3:  started, but at the same time, right this week he launched the Tesla

820
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:48,905
Speaker 3:  Diner, which Matthew, you actually went there. Can you, Matthew, can

821
00:49:48,905 --> 00:49:52,505
Speaker 3:  you gimme like a, like, what is this diner? This is a real restaurant. Like,

822
00:49:52,505 --> 00:49:55,145
Speaker 3:  he's serious about this. It's not just some, some pop-up.

823
00:49:55,605 --> 00:49:58,785
Speaker 8:  Oh no, this, this, this restaurant was sort of

824
00:49:59,275 --> 00:50:02,865
Speaker 8:  based on a diner model, like car hop, Sonic,

825
00:50:03,215 --> 00:50:03,945
Speaker 8:  that kind of thing.

826
00:50:05,525 --> 00:50:09,065
Speaker 8:  And he announced it, actually it was announced in like 2018. So

827
00:50:09,455 --> 00:50:12,825
Speaker 8:  back then certainly we're like, oh, this is, this restaurant is vaporware

828
00:50:12,845 --> 00:50:16,465
Speaker 8:  and, and we're never gonna see it. And so seven years

829
00:50:16,515 --> 00:50:20,345
Speaker 8:  later they announced that he was partnering with a

830
00:50:20,345 --> 00:50:24,225
Speaker 8:  very competent restaurateur and a well-known LA chef. And, and it opened

831
00:50:24,225 --> 00:50:28,140
Speaker 8:  basically Surprise opened. They didn't invite anyone in. They didn't do any

832
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:32,085
Speaker 8:  like, media, nothing. And so Monday morning I schlep

833
00:50:32,105 --> 00:50:35,965
Speaker 8:  out to Hollywood and beheld

834
00:50:35,965 --> 00:50:39,845
Speaker 8:  this two story kind of rounded. It looks like you're

835
00:50:39,845 --> 00:50:43,165
Speaker 8:  at Tomorrowland in Disneyland kind of a thing. And there's like

836
00:50:43,785 --> 00:50:47,645
Speaker 8:  robots serving popcorn and they have screens where you order, and

837
00:50:47,945 --> 00:50:51,125
Speaker 8:  at the end of the day, it's just like, it's diner. Like they have burgers

838
00:50:51,185 --> 00:50:55,045
Speaker 8:  and, and fries and, and pie shakes. Like, just kind of

839
00:50:55,045 --> 00:50:58,685
Speaker 8:  like, just real normal food. It is shockingly

840
00:50:58,775 --> 00:51:01,725
Speaker 8:  basic, considering it's a Tesla product,

841
00:51:02,565 --> 00:51:06,525
Speaker 8:  there are also like 80 charging stations next

842
00:51:06,525 --> 00:51:10,365
Speaker 8:  to it. So I guess the idea is that it's gonna be a model of, of an

843
00:51:10,365 --> 00:51:14,085
Speaker 8:  amenity for charging stations that could potentially open all around the

844
00:51:14,085 --> 00:51:14,205
Speaker 8:  world.

845
00:51:14,465 --> 00:51:17,125
Speaker 7:  That's kind of the innovation here, is that, you know, he has long talked

846
00:51:17,125 --> 00:51:20,365
Speaker 7:  about, you know, the fact that like, you know, charging stations in, in America,

847
00:51:20,365 --> 00:51:23,005
Speaker 7:  especially the supercharger stations, they're kind of like in the middle

848
00:51:23,005 --> 00:51:26,725
Speaker 7:  of nowhere. Often they're in, you know, big box store parking

849
00:51:26,915 --> 00:51:30,605
Speaker 7:  lots or you know, along highways and they're not, they're not real

850
00:51:30,605 --> 00:51:33,605
Speaker 7:  destinations. And I think what he was trying to go forward with this is,

851
00:51:33,665 --> 00:51:36,725
Speaker 7:  you know, you know, you have to plug in your car and usually it takes like

852
00:51:36,725 --> 00:51:40,005
Speaker 7:  20 or 30 minutes for you to get like a decent amount of charge. Why not get

853
00:51:40,005 --> 00:51:43,485
Speaker 7:  something to eat? Why not, you know, mingle with other Tesla owners? Like

854
00:51:43,485 --> 00:51:45,325
Speaker 7:  the idea behind it seems pretty solid.

855
00:51:45,325 --> 00:51:48,885
Speaker 4:  That's actually a pretty good idea. 'cause I went on a road trip in one of

856
00:51:48,885 --> 00:51:52,445
Speaker 4:  the fully electric BMWs around the holiday season

857
00:51:52,825 --> 00:51:56,605
Speaker 4:  and trying to find a charger that would work

858
00:51:57,385 --> 00:52:01,365
Speaker 4:  got increasingly dicey. Oh yeah. It's a, as we were, as we were

859
00:52:01,365 --> 00:52:04,845
Speaker 4:  going, it's just like, it's tough. Oh, I guess we can go to this mall. And

860
00:52:04,845 --> 00:52:08,605
Speaker 4:  there was a line at the mall of all of these Teslas trying to get the thing,

861
00:52:08,705 --> 00:52:12,285
Speaker 4:  and it's like, well, we have 23% charge left on this

862
00:52:12,325 --> 00:52:15,565
Speaker 4:  BMW are we going to find, we got down to

863
00:52:15,935 --> 00:52:19,445
Speaker 4:  7%, we got down to 7% at a Wawa.

864
00:52:20,065 --> 00:52:23,725
Speaker 4:  And at this Wawa had only one working charging station.

865
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:27,885
Speaker 4:  So I could, we, were we hungry by the time we got to the Wawa? Yeah.

866
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:31,565
Speaker 4:  So I could see this working, but at the same time,

867
00:52:33,095 --> 00:52:35,875
Speaker 4:  no, just big. No,

868
00:52:36,435 --> 00:52:40,235
Speaker 3:  I, I've done that. I've, I've sat in the Walmart parking lot for a couple

869
00:52:40,295 --> 00:52:44,075
Speaker 3:  of hours while on a road trip and it's like, it's not the most fun. It's

870
00:52:44,075 --> 00:52:47,515
Speaker 3:  not the most it is, but like, this sort of makes sense, right? You can do

871
00:52:47,515 --> 00:52:51,395
Speaker 3:  this in LA it feels hard to imagine

872
00:52:51,395 --> 00:52:54,675
Speaker 3:  this existing on the side of like the PA turnpike

873
00:52:55,535 --> 00:52:59,115
Speaker 3:  And I like, you know, like, this is like a destination. It's so interesting.

874
00:52:59,115 --> 00:53:02,235
Speaker 3:  All the photos I've seen of the Tesla dinosaur. Far, far,

875
00:53:03,085 --> 00:53:06,635
Speaker 3:  every single parking spot has a cyber truck. Yeah. Oh yeah. Which I can't

876
00:53:06,635 --> 00:53:10,195
Speaker 3:  tell if they just like parked them there or if it's just every cyber truck

877
00:53:10,195 --> 00:53:13,995
Speaker 3:  owner in LA like an alarm went off and they're like, here now

878
00:53:14,655 --> 00:53:14,875
Speaker 3:  go.

879
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:17,755
Speaker 7:  They got notifications on their infotainment screen.

880
00:53:17,755 --> 00:53:20,875
Speaker 3:  Well there is Matthew, you were telling me there is some like special feature

881
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:24,355
Speaker 3:  where if you have a Tesla, you can like roll up and it will like auto order

882
00:53:24,455 --> 00:53:24,755
Speaker 3:  for you.

883
00:53:25,705 --> 00:53:29,605
Speaker 8:  Not quite, so basically probably in a car industry first you could

884
00:53:29,695 --> 00:53:33,685
Speaker 8:  place your order on your car screen. It doesn't matter where you are.

885
00:53:33,685 --> 00:53:36,925
Speaker 8:  Like, I could be home. I live in Torrance, like 30 miles away from the, the,

886
00:53:36,985 --> 00:53:40,805
Speaker 8:  the restaurant. If I pull up the app, the diner app on my screen,

887
00:53:41,315 --> 00:53:45,285
Speaker 8:  then it will look exactly like the screen that you would see in

888
00:53:45,285 --> 00:53:49,085
Speaker 8:  the restaurant, like to order food and and drinks or whatever.

889
00:53:49,085 --> 00:53:52,605
Speaker 8:  And we're, I think we're pretty used to ordering food that way now because,

890
00:53:52,865 --> 00:53:56,045
Speaker 8:  you know, they wanna get rid of staff at the counter to take your order.

891
00:53:56,745 --> 00:54:00,325
Speaker 8:  And all you need to do is put your order in and I guess your payment stuff

892
00:54:00,325 --> 00:54:04,085
Speaker 8:  is already in there because of your charging. And when you cross

893
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:08,005
Speaker 8:  like a geofence as they've called it like a, it's like 0.6 miles,

894
00:54:08,095 --> 00:54:11,925
Speaker 8:  about 15 min in LA that could take forever. But, you know, 0.6 miles,

895
00:54:12,435 --> 00:54:15,605
Speaker 8:  once you approach the diner, then they'll, they'll get a notification to

896
00:54:15,605 --> 00:54:19,245
Speaker 8:  like start making your food. And then once you, I guess park in a, if you

897
00:54:19,315 --> 00:54:22,765
Speaker 8:  park in the lot and you start charging your car, you'll get an option like,

898
00:54:22,765 --> 00:54:26,725
Speaker 8:  Hey, do you wanna get your food in your car? Or do you wanna come in

899
00:54:26,725 --> 00:54:30,485
Speaker 8:  the restaurant? Something like that. It hasn't actually launched yet, or

900
00:54:30,485 --> 00:54:33,765
Speaker 8:  I, I don't think it works in the way that they've quite intended, but I think

901
00:54:33,795 --> 00:54:37,685
Speaker 8:  this feature was supposed to be one of the more important aspects

902
00:54:37,685 --> 00:54:38,365
Speaker 8:  of the diner

903
00:54:38,755 --> 00:54:42,485
Speaker 3:  That does like, lend to the idea of like, this is sort of this amenity

904
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:45,805
Speaker 3:  for charging, which is so interesting. I, I think like you hear, there's

905
00:54:45,805 --> 00:54:49,445
Speaker 3:  a restaurant, you see these photos of like, the interior looks lovely, right?

906
00:54:49,445 --> 00:54:52,405
Speaker 3:  It looks like this, like it looks like a di retro futuristic,

907
00:54:52,425 --> 00:54:55,885
Speaker 7:  And I guess like other non Tesla EV owners can charge there if they have

908
00:54:56,205 --> 00:54:59,805
Speaker 7:  adapters or if they have cars that have supercharger ports on them. I refuse

909
00:54:59,865 --> 00:55:00,085
Speaker 7:  to

910
00:55:00,085 --> 00:55:01,405
Speaker 4:  Have the, the adapter

911
00:55:01,405 --> 00:55:03,765
Speaker 7:  For one, but I, I don't think that some of these like menu features would,

912
00:55:03,765 --> 00:55:06,845
Speaker 7:  would work on the BM BMW for example. But, you know, it does sort of speak

913
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:10,285
Speaker 7:  to like this future that Tesla has imagined where you can just do all these

914
00:55:10,285 --> 00:55:13,485
Speaker 7:  things seamlessly and it's all integrated. All your information is right

915
00:55:13,485 --> 00:55:17,125
Speaker 7:  there. I i, I do think that that's, if it ends up actually working would

916
00:55:17,125 --> 00:55:18,165
Speaker 7:  be a pretty cool thing.

917
00:55:18,875 --> 00:55:22,645
Speaker 4:  Okay. But my big thing is how was the food, Matthew,

918
00:55:23,085 --> 00:55:25,205
Speaker 4:  because this is a diner that's the most important question. It's primary,

919
00:55:25,385 --> 00:55:29,245
Speaker 4:  you know, like restaurants, they, sometimes you go to a restaurant for the

920
00:55:29,245 --> 00:55:32,805
Speaker 4:  vibe. I will not be going to a Tesla diner for the vibe.

921
00:55:33,285 --> 00:55:37,205
Speaker 4:  I will be there because I need to charge a car and I'm hungry. So of those

922
00:55:37,225 --> 00:55:40,885
Speaker 4:  two components, how is the food, because I looked at the menu,

923
00:55:41,835 --> 00:55:45,365
Speaker 4:  epic Bacon, $12 hot

924
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:49,125
Speaker 4:  dog, 13 do $13 for a hot dog in this economy.

925
00:55:51,005 --> 00:55:54,485
Speaker 8:  I mean, I don't think the first of all the food, you know, I'll just, lemme

926
00:55:54,485 --> 00:55:58,205
Speaker 8:  just preface all of this by saying you cannot imagine the amount of

927
00:55:58,705 --> 00:56:02,285
Speaker 8:  hatred and like negative feedback that I have gotten

928
00:56:02,435 --> 00:56:06,205
Speaker 8:  like just covering this restaurant. Like people are so

929
00:56:06,295 --> 00:56:09,645
Speaker 8:  upset. And if you look at the Eater Instagram comments, oh my God, yeah,

930
00:56:09,645 --> 00:56:12,325
Speaker 8:  there, there is an incredible amount of, I guess

931
00:56:13,335 --> 00:56:16,365
Speaker 8:  anger, just the fact that we're covering it, like we should have just passed

932
00:56:16,425 --> 00:56:19,165
Speaker 8:  on it or something like that. But I mean, there are hundreds, there were

933
00:56:19,165 --> 00:56:22,405
Speaker 8:  hundreds of people waiting in line for it to open. Some people waited hours.

934
00:56:24,065 --> 00:56:27,915
Speaker 8:  It's a 24 7 restaurant so that you could, you know, it, the, the birth

935
00:56:27,915 --> 00:56:31,595
Speaker 8:  of a new twenty four seven restaurant in any big city is kind of a, a big

936
00:56:31,595 --> 00:56:35,075
Speaker 8:  deal now given where, you know, costs and labor are. So

937
00:56:35,335 --> 00:56:38,635
Speaker 8:  either way, like we were gonna cover this restaurant and of course we approached

938
00:56:38,635 --> 00:56:42,475
Speaker 8:  it with as much, you know, knowing who Elon is and

939
00:56:42,475 --> 00:56:45,875
Speaker 8:  what he is done and, and everything that the, the company represents. At

940
00:56:45,875 --> 00:56:49,715
Speaker 8:  the end of the day, we're like, look, they hired Bill Cha, who is a prolific

941
00:56:49,775 --> 00:56:53,475
Speaker 8:  LA restaurateur. He is behind Republic and Bestia and tar and

942
00:56:54,225 --> 00:56:57,875
Speaker 8:  he's very competent as an operator. I've known him for a while and they hired

943
00:56:57,905 --> 00:57:01,755
Speaker 8:  Eric Greenspan, who's, you know, I think claim to fame. He

944
00:57:01,755 --> 00:57:05,595
Speaker 8:  opened a che, a grilled cheese restaurant like 10 years ago in la but

945
00:57:05,595 --> 00:57:09,475
Speaker 8:  he also was the chef behind a bunch of ghost kitchens

946
00:57:09,475 --> 00:57:13,235
Speaker 8:  like the Mr. Beas Burger. And he was like, ah, when I saw Greenspan

947
00:57:13,235 --> 00:57:16,035
Speaker 8:  there, he was like, interesting. Oh, this is, this line's nothing. We served

948
00:57:16,135 --> 00:57:20,075
Speaker 8:  10,000 people when Mr. Be Burger opened. And I, I was kind of

949
00:57:20,075 --> 00:57:23,995
Speaker 8:  like, well, Mr. Beberg is kind of dead now, and Mr. Beast, the

950
00:57:23,995 --> 00:57:27,875
Speaker 8:  guy like is suing the company for it. It just like,

951
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:30,995
Speaker 8:  it was a disaster, right? So I'm thinking, okay, is this gonna be a disaster?

952
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:34,995
Speaker 8:  We order the food, we take it upstairs, we paid for everything. No

953
00:57:34,995 --> 00:57:38,755
Speaker 8:  special treatment other than did get to kind of skip a few places

954
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:41,875
Speaker 8:  in line to expedite our, our our reporting. And

955
00:57:43,155 --> 00:57:47,035
Speaker 8:  honestly, the food is fine. It tastes like sort of slightly better

956
00:57:47,035 --> 00:57:50,955
Speaker 8:  than Shake Shack, slightly better than, you know, regular fast food. Is it,

957
00:57:51,345 --> 00:57:55,235
Speaker 8:  it's probably better than Denny's, you know, it's better than your like

958
00:57:55,395 --> 00:57:59,075
Speaker 8:  average roadside spot. And I think that's probably because look,

959
00:57:59,355 --> 00:58:02,395
Speaker 8:  everyone's all hands on deck. It's the first day it's open. As we all know,

960
00:58:02,635 --> 00:58:05,995
Speaker 8:  restaurants are a tough thing to operate day in and day out, and especially

961
00:58:05,995 --> 00:58:09,795
Speaker 8:  24 7. And so do I think it's gonna maintain that quality

962
00:58:10,145 --> 00:58:13,835
Speaker 8:  five, eight months from now? You know, two years from now? I have no

963
00:58:14,035 --> 00:58:17,715
Speaker 8:  idea and I'm very skeptical of that. But on day one,

964
00:58:19,105 --> 00:58:23,075
Speaker 8:  they were making good food. The burger was not amazing. It was kind of

965
00:58:23,095 --> 00:58:26,995
Speaker 8:  dry on the edges. The tuna melt was fantastic. We all

966
00:58:26,995 --> 00:58:30,035
Speaker 8:  loved it. It was like heavy and dill and like, well toasted.

967
00:58:30,995 --> 00:58:34,395
Speaker 8:  They're all served in like these cyber truck happy meal boxes. No, that like,

968
00:58:35,295 --> 00:58:38,675
Speaker 8:  you just ruined it. You ruined it. No, that's like, yeah, I think that's

969
00:58:38,675 --> 00:58:42,355
Speaker 8:  kind of a negative. But you know, they're going with the theme

970
00:58:42,465 --> 00:58:46,435
Speaker 8:  also. The, all the silverware or the utensils are like these wooden

971
00:58:46,575 --> 00:58:50,435
Speaker 8:  pieces that look like, they're like chiseled out of a cyber truck, you know,

972
00:58:50,655 --> 00:58:54,435
Speaker 8:  oh God frame or something. And I lost the opportunity for the windshield

973
00:58:54,485 --> 00:58:54,835
Speaker 8:  wiper.

974
00:58:56,945 --> 00:59:00,075
Speaker 8:  Like they're trying to reinvent utensils and I'm like, oh my God, okay. Not

975
00:59:00,075 --> 00:59:03,875
Speaker 8:  everything be reinvented, but like, I think, you know, they,

976
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:06,875
Speaker 8:  they for breakfast, you know, they have actual breakfast items. They had

977
00:59:06,915 --> 00:59:10,355
Speaker 8:  a biscuits with red gravy and the biscuits were

978
00:59:10,425 --> 00:59:14,355
Speaker 8:  fantastic. You have an organic egg. I got all the, all the ingredients

979
00:59:14,455 --> 00:59:17,635
Speaker 8:  is another aspect. They, they say that they're sourcing everything within

980
00:59:17,915 --> 00:59:18,435
Speaker 8:  a Tesla

981
00:59:20,045 --> 00:59:23,845
Speaker 8:  range, like one single range of a Tesla car. So everything is

982
00:59:23,845 --> 00:59:27,605
Speaker 8:  sourced within like 300 miles. Which, you know, like, there's something to

983
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:31,205
Speaker 8:  be said about that. Like most diners probably cannot say that they source

984
00:59:31,205 --> 00:59:35,085
Speaker 8:  their items from, you know, within 300 miles. And so that there's

985
00:59:35,085 --> 00:59:38,445
Speaker 8:  like this sliver of like, sustainability and like, okay, good

986
00:59:38,445 --> 00:59:39,845
Speaker 7:  Quality too. That sounds kind of woke to me.

987
00:59:41,555 --> 00:59:44,485
Speaker 8:  It's, it's, yeah, that's why they minimize it. It's like buried on the bottom

988
00:59:44,485 --> 00:59:45,405
Speaker 8:  of the menu. But like, yeah,

989
00:59:45,405 --> 00:59:49,165
Speaker 7:  You did Epic Bacon is the headline. The heritage farm that it comes from

990
00:59:49,165 --> 00:59:50,765
Speaker 7:  is not, not, not mentioned as much.

991
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:54,605
Speaker 8:  I talked to Bill Che and he was like, Elon himself came in a week and a half

992
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:58,525
Speaker 8:  ago and personally tried everything. He's like, he, if it's gonna be on the

993
00:59:58,525 --> 01:00:02,405
Speaker 8:  menu, it has to be epic. Okay. And I was like, how do you make every

994
01:00:02,405 --> 01:00:05,845
Speaker 8:  single menu item epic? Like how do you make like, you know, a hot dog epic

995
01:00:05,905 --> 01:00:09,765
Speaker 8:  or a burger epic. But the Epic logo is only on

996
01:00:09,765 --> 01:00:13,725
Speaker 8:  the bacon and the bacon. Well, I think it was a matter

997
01:00:13,725 --> 01:00:17,605
Speaker 8:  of preparation. It has the potential to be epic. There was certainly

998
01:00:18,195 --> 01:00:22,165
Speaker 8:  four thick slices of like, well smoked, like high

999
01:00:22,165 --> 01:00:26,005
Speaker 8:  quality bacon, like it, you know, just maybe that day it was off.

1000
01:00:26,025 --> 01:00:29,405
Speaker 8:  But I, I think for 12 bucks, honestly, I, I would pay that.

1001
01:00:29,665 --> 01:00:32,565
Speaker 3:  That's $3 per piece of bacon. But

1002
01:00:32,565 --> 01:00:35,405
Speaker 8:  Like, that's what food costs. Now, I don't know what you,

1003
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:37,125
Speaker 3:  How did they prepare this bacon

1004
01:00:38,005 --> 01:00:38,565
Speaker 7:  Epically

1005
01:00:38,565 --> 01:00:42,445
Speaker 8:  Like food costs. It's, it's not cheap

1006
01:00:42,625 --> 01:00:46,605
Speaker 8:  to make, you know, well sourced food. And I think

1007
01:00:46,605 --> 01:00:50,485
Speaker 8:  that they're doing a good job of presenting people with decent quality,

1008
01:00:50,715 --> 01:00:54,605
Speaker 8:  like well-prepared food at a reasonable price. And

1009
01:00:54,605 --> 01:00:58,285
Speaker 8:  what's interesting is all the, like, they don't accept gratuities. Like they're,

1010
01:00:58,305 --> 01:01:02,005
Speaker 8:  the, the company is actually paying all the gratuities

1011
01:01:02,465 --> 01:01:06,125
Speaker 8:  for service staff. So if you go there, like the level of service you get

1012
01:01:06,145 --> 01:01:09,325
Speaker 8:  is incredibly nice. Like everyone's very jolly and happy and,

1013
01:01:10,105 --> 01:01:13,725
Speaker 8:  and like attentive. And I don't know if that's because it's the first day

1014
01:01:13,725 --> 01:01:17,645
Speaker 8:  again, or like if it's a thing that I think a seasoned restaurateur is like,

1015
01:01:17,645 --> 01:01:21,245
Speaker 8:  Hey, we're gonna approach this professionally and as well done as possible.

1016
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:24,845
Speaker 7:  You have to go back at 3:00 AM to fe to see if it's still the same level.

1017
01:01:24,845 --> 01:01:25,085
Speaker 7:  Yeah,

1018
01:01:25,085 --> 01:01:27,325
Speaker 8:  You gotta go there in the middle of the night to see if they'll still still

1019
01:01:27,325 --> 01:01:30,525
Speaker 8:  be happy. But at the end of the day, I think it is a

1020
01:01:30,805 --> 01:01:34,725
Speaker 8:  bonafide restaurant. It is worth covering. It was worth,

1021
01:01:35,105 --> 01:01:39,085
Speaker 8:  you know, for us to go and see what it was like. Do I expect that I'll

1022
01:01:39,085 --> 01:01:42,965
Speaker 8:  be there frequently? I don't think so. But

1023
01:01:43,125 --> 01:01:46,605
Speaker 8:  I was honestly shocked by the number of quote unquote like Tesla fans

1024
01:01:47,195 --> 01:01:50,685
Speaker 8:  that live in Los Angeles, that despite all of the Elon,

1025
01:01:51,345 --> 01:01:55,285
Speaker 8:  you know, hatred and vitriol, like, I think people were there. They

1026
01:01:55,285 --> 01:01:58,765
Speaker 8:  were, they showed up and they were, they were pretty happy. So I mean,

1027
01:01:59,585 --> 01:02:02,405
Speaker 7:  That's what it is. That to me is kind of the key point. 'cause I, I, I, I

1028
01:02:02,405 --> 01:02:04,605
Speaker 7:  think Wired had a good story about this too, where they talked to some of

1029
01:02:04,605 --> 01:02:08,565
Speaker 7:  these folks and a lot of them were Tesla owners who didn't like Elon Musk.

1030
01:02:08,705 --> 01:02:12,405
Speaker 7:  And it was kind of like getting to your point about how this is, you know,

1031
01:02:12,465 --> 01:02:16,085
Speaker 7:  the people that they typically used to sell to a lot for many years

1032
01:02:16,635 --> 01:02:20,485
Speaker 7:  were coastal liberal types progressives who, you know, want to

1033
01:02:20,485 --> 01:02:23,845
Speaker 7:  save the environment. And those people hate Elon Musk,

1034
01:02:24,545 --> 01:02:27,165
Speaker 7:  but it seems like they can, you know, they're doing some sort of mental,

1035
01:02:27,385 --> 01:02:31,085
Speaker 7:  you know, sort of calculation to kind of separate these things and

1036
01:02:31,225 --> 01:02:34,325
Speaker 7:  you know, they can still be supportive of the brand or, you know, still love

1037
01:02:34,325 --> 01:02:37,965
Speaker 7:  their car while also still holding their, you know,

1038
01:02:37,965 --> 01:02:39,405
Speaker 7:  political opinions about him.

1039
01:02:39,585 --> 01:02:43,125
Speaker 3:  So my, my question is, right, like, it, you know, you, you, you know, Matthew,

1040
01:02:43,145 --> 01:02:46,565
Speaker 3:  you went, you had this nice experience, I think, right? A ton of people showed

1041
01:02:46,565 --> 01:02:50,525
Speaker 3:  up. Can they scale this? Right? Can you scale like

1042
01:02:50,845 --> 01:02:54,805
Speaker 3:  a, a, you know, fancy diner chain that only

1043
01:02:54,805 --> 01:02:58,005
Speaker 3:  goes to a couple of different, like what, what is the end goal here?

1044
01:02:58,205 --> 01:03:01,805
Speaker 4:  I don't know if you're sourcing within a one charge

1045
01:03:01,895 --> 01:03:05,645
Speaker 4:  range of a, of a Tesla, right? Because there are some places, you know,

1046
01:03:05,645 --> 01:03:09,605
Speaker 4:  California has a lot of farms, but there are places out there where

1047
01:03:09,835 --> 01:03:13,725
Speaker 4:  corn sweat is an issue. Oh yeah. And the Midwest where temperatures

1048
01:03:13,725 --> 01:03:17,565
Speaker 4:  are awful because the corn is raising the humidity. So like,

1049
01:03:17,605 --> 01:03:21,565
Speaker 4:  I don't know, like if you're gonna have the same gimmick across the,

1050
01:03:21,585 --> 01:03:24,685
Speaker 4:  the, the entire nation, I don't know how even

1051
01:03:25,035 --> 01:03:28,445
Speaker 3:  That is mean. Even charging infrastructure Yeah. Is hard. So like, right,

1052
01:03:28,445 --> 01:03:32,245
Speaker 3:  like getting the charging infrastructure and the food infrastructure and

1053
01:03:32,245 --> 01:03:35,805
Speaker 3:  finding a place where it makes sense for Tesla owners or EV owners.

1054
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:39,645
Speaker 3:  I, I am curious like Matthew, like do, do you get the sense that

1055
01:03:40,355 --> 01:03:44,125
Speaker 3:  Bill Cha and the team over there are preparing to do more? Are they like,

1056
01:03:44,455 --> 01:03:46,605
Speaker 3:  we've got this one, we will see what happens?

1057
01:03:47,205 --> 01:03:50,245
Speaker 8:  That's a great question I had. I, I certainly have my doubts about that.

1058
01:03:50,315 --> 01:03:54,045
Speaker 8:  Like how replic how much can you replicate this? You're in the middle of

1059
01:03:54,045 --> 01:03:57,445
Speaker 8:  Hollywood. There's all the resources, labor, you know,

1060
01:03:57,745 --> 01:04:01,565
Speaker 8:  demand for a hundred, almost a hundred charging stations. But like

1061
01:04:01,565 --> 01:04:03,405
Speaker 8:  I've, I've taken road trips. I actually own a Tesla

1062
01:04:05,025 --> 01:04:08,685
Speaker 8:  And I have taken it, I hate it as a road trip car. 'cause I have to charge

1063
01:04:08,685 --> 01:04:12,565
Speaker 8:  all the time. And I've charged in the middle of the desert

1064
01:04:12,825 --> 01:04:15,045
Speaker 8:  on the way to Vegas. Just nothing to do.

1065
01:04:16,805 --> 01:04:20,285
Speaker 8:  I wonder, okay, if they open one in Barstow, right? There's like a hundred

1066
01:04:20,285 --> 01:04:24,085
Speaker 8:  Tesla chargers in Barstow scattered about, it's, it's the main city between

1067
01:04:24,225 --> 01:04:25,245
Speaker 8:  LA and, and Las Vegas.

1068
01:04:27,645 --> 01:04:31,165
Speaker 8:  I think they can source, depending on what their menu looks like, is it gonna

1069
01:04:31,165 --> 01:04:34,485
Speaker 8:  be as ambitions as the Hollywood one with like 30 menu items? Maybe not.

1070
01:04:34,485 --> 01:04:37,805
Speaker 8:  But if they have a burger and a hot dog and fries and shakes,

1071
01:04:38,525 --> 01:04:42,405
Speaker 8:  I mean, what, what more do you really need? And can you do that? Look, there

1072
01:04:42,405 --> 01:04:45,925
Speaker 8:  are gas station restaurants all around the country and they serve, you know,

1073
01:04:46,075 --> 01:04:49,925
Speaker 8:  basically reheated frozen pizza and hot dogs on those like

1074
01:04:49,925 --> 01:04:53,765
Speaker 8:  steel rollers and they make it work. And I think

1075
01:04:53,835 --> 01:04:56,685
Speaker 8:  it's certainly possible. I think their intention is to open,

1076
01:04:57,805 --> 01:05:01,725
Speaker 8:  I think many of them a rest opening a restaurant

1077
01:05:01,865 --> 01:05:05,405
Speaker 8:  as they probably realize is very difficult given

1078
01:05:05,665 --> 01:05:09,645
Speaker 8:  the regulatory situations of each place that you're doing it. But other

1079
01:05:09,885 --> 01:05:12,645
Speaker 8:  countries are different. Like if they, I don't know, like I just came back

1080
01:05:12,645 --> 01:05:15,925
Speaker 8:  from South Korea. I I didn't know this. You could open any restaurant in

1081
01:05:15,925 --> 01:05:19,725
Speaker 8:  South Korea and in Seoul and there's no permitting. You just like open,

1082
01:05:19,825 --> 01:05:22,965
Speaker 8:  you just like build stuff and then you open and then you're open for business

1083
01:05:22,965 --> 01:05:26,805
Speaker 8:  and you serve people. Like if they had that ease in other locations

1084
01:05:26,805 --> 01:05:30,205
Speaker 8:  around the world, then they could probably open more of these diners and

1085
01:05:30,205 --> 01:05:34,005
Speaker 8:  make them, you know, these kind of like destinations, restaurants are,

1086
01:05:34,875 --> 01:05:37,805
Speaker 8:  they're, they're, they're places that people talk about, you know, they're

1087
01:05:37,805 --> 01:05:40,845
Speaker 8:  not like, it's kind of like the Apple store, right? I mean when the first

1088
01:05:40,845 --> 01:05:43,205
Speaker 8:  couple Apple stores came out, they're like, oh, how many of these are gonna

1089
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:47,165
Speaker 8:  open and now they're ubiquitous, right? So it took a generation, I think

1090
01:05:47,165 --> 01:05:50,845
Speaker 8:  these diners could be a, a place where it makes

1091
01:05:50,855 --> 01:05:54,365
Speaker 8:  Tesla continue to be relevant and, and separates themselves

1092
01:05:54,715 --> 01:05:58,485
Speaker 8:  from other car makers and, and, you know, gives again

1093
01:05:58,685 --> 01:06:02,525
Speaker 8:  a a a place for people to engage with the brand. And so

1094
01:06:03,145 --> 01:06:06,245
Speaker 8:  do I think, I think it's actually smart And I think it's interesting that

1095
01:06:06,245 --> 01:06:10,165
Speaker 8:  they opened it in California, in, in Los Angeles, a

1096
01:06:10,165 --> 01:06:13,365
Speaker 8:  place that obviously has very mixed feelings politically about

1097
01:06:14,185 --> 01:06:17,805
Speaker 8:  its CEO. I'm, I'm like, why didn't they open in Texas? Why didn't they open

1098
01:06:17,865 --> 01:06:21,285
Speaker 8:  in Florida or whatever? Like in, in places that might be more receptive.

1099
01:06:21,305 --> 01:06:25,005
Speaker 8:  But I think they're also trying to make a statement by putting it in Hollywood,

1100
01:06:25,005 --> 01:06:28,885
Speaker 8:  putting it in a major world city and making

1101
01:06:29,005 --> 01:06:29,765
Speaker 8:  a statement that way.

1102
01:06:29,955 --> 01:06:32,245
Speaker 7:  They're definitely gonna attract protestors.

1103
01:06:34,125 --> 01:06:38,085
Speaker 7:  I I spoke to an organizer who has been, you know, part of the Tesla T

1104
01:06:38,085 --> 01:06:40,845
Speaker 7:  Down movement and he's, you know, they're, they're planning on coming out

1105
01:06:40,845 --> 01:06:44,445
Speaker 7:  this Saturday and he says that the intention is to keep coming out. You know,

1106
01:06:44,515 --> 01:06:47,085
Speaker 7:  they're, they're gonna keep at it, you know, they, their, their mission is

1107
01:06:47,085 --> 01:06:50,085
Speaker 7:  to continue to protest the company. They don't care that he's stepped away

1108
01:06:50,085 --> 01:06:53,805
Speaker 7:  from Doge and yada yada yada. They, their, you know, their, in their intention,

1109
01:06:53,915 --> 01:06:57,805
Speaker 7:  they, they see they're being seen success obviously in

1110
01:06:57,805 --> 01:07:00,565
Speaker 7:  the earnings report. And I think that they want to

1111
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:04,645
Speaker 3:  Continue that. And something like a diner is, is so much more impactful in

1112
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:07,965
Speaker 3:  the moment. Like they are customers who are trying to show up and have a

1113
01:07:08,045 --> 01:07:11,005
Speaker 3:  pleasant meal. Yeah. Yeah. And you were going to disrupt their ability to

1114
01:07:11,345 --> 01:07:15,085
Speaker 3:  do good business. Yeah, yeah. If nobody's gonna wanna walk past them or you,

1115
01:07:15,085 --> 01:07:18,165
Speaker 7:  You, it's hard, it's hard not to see this also as maybe an attempt at some

1116
01:07:18,165 --> 01:07:21,765
Speaker 7:  brand rehabilitation by Tesla, right? To like kind of say, you know, we are,

1117
01:07:21,765 --> 01:07:25,645
Speaker 7:  we're more than just the guy making the salute, you know, Trump's

1118
01:07:25,645 --> 01:07:28,565
Speaker 7:  inauguration. We're also, you know, we got these fun

1119
01:07:29,305 --> 01:07:32,965
Speaker 7:  robots that are serving popcorn and, you know, we're going to the, to, to

1120
01:07:33,035 --> 01:07:34,085
Speaker 7:  Mars and all these other things.

1121
01:07:34,085 --> 01:07:35,245
Speaker 3:  They've got like a movie screen,

1122
01:07:35,625 --> 01:07:39,405
Speaker 7:  The huge, the di okay. So the drive-in screens are gigantic and

1123
01:07:39,405 --> 01:07:42,605
Speaker 7:  they're right in front of an apartment buildings with balconies that have

1124
01:07:42,605 --> 01:07:46,165
Speaker 7:  just oh, had their views completely blocked. And I am

1125
01:07:46,425 --> 01:07:50,045
Speaker 7:  so curious to hear what the people who live in these buildings

1126
01:07:50,255 --> 01:07:53,645
Speaker 7:  think about this free movies from the back. Okay.

1127
01:07:53,645 --> 01:07:57,285
Speaker 3:  Maybe not from the nevermind, but you know, I gotta know who you,

1128
01:07:57,705 --> 01:08:00,285
Speaker 7:  You gotta track down some of these people who live in the, in, in these buildings

1129
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:02,445
Speaker 7:  and find out what they think. 'cause I, I, I gotta know.

1130
01:08:02,685 --> 01:08:06,485
Speaker 8:  I mean, that was what I immediately thought about. I think that in

1131
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:10,325
Speaker 8:  most, first of all, you don't live in like Hollywood for quiet and

1132
01:08:10,325 --> 01:08:14,245
Speaker 8:  comfort. And that's good point. You don't, nobody is forcing you

1133
01:08:14,245 --> 01:08:18,085
Speaker 8:  to live there. Granted, there are again, ginormous billboard

1134
01:08:18,245 --> 01:08:21,685
Speaker 8:  sized screens pointing at your balcony now. And that's probably very annoying.

1135
01:08:22,085 --> 01:08:25,005
Speaker 8:  I do think that I, I actually find, I try was trying to find out what time

1136
01:08:25,005 --> 01:08:27,925
Speaker 8:  they turn off. There's probably like a mandated time. Oh yeah. I think it's

1137
01:08:27,925 --> 01:08:31,445
Speaker 8:  11:00 PM they said. Yeah, I think it's 11. That wasn't confirmed. I actually

1138
01:08:31,445 --> 01:08:34,845
Speaker 8:  wrote that like, kind of like, are you, but there it wasn't confirmed. I'm

1139
01:08:34,845 --> 01:08:38,765
Speaker 8:  pretty sure that's like, we don't have billboards going 24 7 here on unlike

1140
01:08:38,945 --> 01:08:42,085
Speaker 8:  New York. So Yeah. New York City. Yeah.

1141
01:08:42,545 --> 01:08:46,405
Speaker 8:  Baby's right, number one. So yeah, it's certainly

1142
01:08:46,405 --> 01:08:49,565
Speaker 8:  very annoying and it's comical. It, I think when you go there,

1143
01:08:51,585 --> 01:08:55,205
Speaker 8:  it would make sense to behold the whole facility like in the middle of the

1144
01:08:55,205 --> 01:08:58,725
Speaker 8:  desert or in the middle of a cornfield or something. But like, it's, it's

1145
01:08:58,725 --> 01:09:02,605
Speaker 8:  in the middle of Hollywood. There are a lot of buildings you can, it's,

1146
01:09:02,675 --> 01:09:05,925
Speaker 8:  it's just like jarring. 'cause I'm like, why do they have to do these ginormous

1147
01:09:05,925 --> 01:09:09,685
Speaker 8:  screens? So there's a, a little bit of it. I think the whole,

1148
01:09:10,485 --> 01:09:13,685
Speaker 8:  what I'm learning now is that, I guess the project is

1149
01:09:14,615 --> 01:09:18,085
Speaker 8:  Franz von Ho's hausen Yeah. Kind of lead designer

1150
01:09:18,545 --> 01:09:22,165
Speaker 8:  of Tesla. Yeah. He's a lead designer of Tesla. And like I was, I think what

1151
01:09:22,165 --> 01:09:25,525
Speaker 8:  I've been told now, and this is not confirmed, but like, he lives in Los

1152
01:09:25,525 --> 01:09:29,405
Speaker 8:  Angeles. The Tesla Design Center is based in Hawthorne in Los Angeles. And

1153
01:09:29,405 --> 01:09:32,205
Speaker 8:  I think that's probably why the first location

1154
01:09:33,265 --> 01:09:37,205
Speaker 8:  was here. It's really like, if you think about where the company split up,

1155
01:09:37,205 --> 01:09:40,885
Speaker 8:  there's like production in Fremont in Northern California and offices and

1156
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:43,645
Speaker 8:  whatnot. That's kind of where they started. But then now they're like sort

1157
01:09:43,645 --> 01:09:47,445
Speaker 8:  of moved the headquarters to Texas and to Austin. But like, I think

1158
01:09:47,445 --> 01:09:51,285
Speaker 8:  at the end of the day for this project, it's really a Tesla design project.

1159
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:54,885
Speaker 8:  It's like a way for them to like, it's like the flexing part of the company.

1160
01:09:55,035 --> 01:09:58,285
Speaker 8:  It's, it's not quite the nuts and bolts like making batteries and boring

1161
01:09:58,285 --> 01:10:02,005
Speaker 8:  stuff like that. This is the sexy thing. And so yeah, I think I,

1162
01:10:02,235 --> 01:10:05,485
Speaker 8:  it's, it's, it's a, it's an attention getter

1163
01:10:06,145 --> 01:10:09,685
Speaker 8:  And I think yeah, people will protest it. There's ginormous

1164
01:10:09,685 --> 01:10:13,245
Speaker 8:  screens, but I don't know, it's la like, we're kind of like used to

1165
01:10:13,655 --> 01:10:16,965
Speaker 8:  crazy stuff happening and then we're gonna move on and find out what else.

1166
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:20,925
Speaker 8:  I mean if I think over like six months, people would be like, eh, there it

1167
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:23,045
Speaker 8:  is. Yeah, exactly. A burger. Yeah. You know,

1168
01:10:23,545 --> 01:10:24,085
Speaker 3:  If nothing else

1169
01:11:41,425 --> 01:11:43,965
Speaker 3:  All right, we're back with the thunder round.

1170
01:11:46,265 --> 01:11:50,135
Speaker 3:  There it is. That's right. For those who have missed it,

1171
01:11:50,295 --> 01:11:54,095
Speaker 3:  I am on a power trip with Neli and David gone the lightning round.

1172
01:11:54,125 --> 01:11:57,535
Speaker 3:  It's done. It's gone. I'm over it. That's so old news.

1173
01:11:58,075 --> 01:12:00,735
Speaker 3:  Here's my problem with it. I don't know if you guys have listened to The

1174
01:12:00,855 --> 01:12:04,335
Speaker 3:  Vergecast a lot. Yeah, I have. I hope you have. That's very good. They never

1175
01:12:04,435 --> 01:12:08,375
Speaker 3:  get through all the stories. Oh, they don't. And so I have given Eric Gomez

1176
01:12:08,455 --> 01:12:12,055
Speaker 3:  our producer, the Power of Thunder. He will,

1177
01:12:12,375 --> 01:12:16,135
Speaker 3:  I don't know what the term, reign it down upon us. Cra it's not

1178
01:12:16,135 --> 01:12:18,735
Speaker 3:  crashing. He'll do a Thor. It's he will, he'll do a Thor.

1179
01:12:18,735 --> 01:12:19,255
Speaker 7:  He a

1180
01:12:19,255 --> 01:12:22,655
Speaker 3:  Thor move. Yeah, there we go. He, he channels Thor

1181
01:12:23,195 --> 01:12:25,815
Speaker 3:  and tells us politely to move along. So

1182
01:12:27,115 --> 01:12:30,965
Speaker 3:  his organ do five stories, five minutes. He's gonna a little

1183
01:12:30,965 --> 01:12:34,765
Speaker 3:  rolling thunder when we need to move along and then it's gonna crash down

1184
01:12:35,185 --> 01:12:38,885
Speaker 3:  or something. We're gonna, we're still figuring this out. The thunder round.

1185
01:12:39,835 --> 01:12:43,285
Speaker 3:  It's new and improved. Gonna get, we'll continue to improve as time goes

1186
01:12:43,385 --> 01:12:46,725
Speaker 3:  on. Alright, first story. Let's roll.

1187
01:12:47,195 --> 01:12:48,205
Speaker 3:  Andy, it's over to

1188
01:12:48,205 --> 01:12:52,125
Speaker 7:  You. All right, so my first story is the return of Faraday future kind of

1189
01:12:52,685 --> 01:12:56,285
Speaker 7:  Faraday future. A electric vehicle company that we've covered for a very

1190
01:12:56,315 --> 01:12:59,645
Speaker 7:  long time. Most a company most associated with the term

1191
01:12:59,835 --> 01:13:03,005
Speaker 7:  vaporware. I think you can say they are one of those companies that,

1192
01:13:03,665 --> 01:13:07,645
Speaker 7:  you know, promised the moon, you know, super fast

1193
01:13:08,045 --> 01:13:11,045
Speaker 7:  electric vehicles and all of these, you know, sort of like interlocking media

1194
01:13:11,185 --> 01:13:14,525
Speaker 7:  and all these things. And it never really panned out. And

1195
01:13:15,275 --> 01:13:19,085
Speaker 7:  they're back, they introduced a new vehicle called the

1196
01:13:19,585 --> 01:13:23,445
Speaker 7:  fx, I'm sorry, the sub-brand. They have a new sub-brand called the FX

1197
01:13:24,065 --> 01:13:27,925
Speaker 7:  in this new vehicle is the FX super one. And it's basically just

1198
01:13:27,925 --> 01:13:31,405
Speaker 7:  like a luxury minivan, but it has something that's

1199
01:13:31,605 --> 01:13:35,565
Speaker 7:  distinctive about it. It has a face. So instead

1200
01:13:35,565 --> 01:13:39,365
Speaker 7:  of a grill in place of a grill, there is a digital screen on the front of

1201
01:13:39,365 --> 01:13:43,205
Speaker 7:  the vehicle that projects like an AI

1202
01:13:43,235 --> 01:13:47,005
Speaker 7:  generated face. So you can put like a smiley face on there. You can put

1203
01:13:47,005 --> 01:13:47,525
Speaker 7:  like, you know,

1204
01:13:47,785 --> 01:13:51,605
Speaker 3:  I'm sorry I scrolled past this image in your story And I, I thought

1205
01:13:51,765 --> 01:13:54,205
Speaker 3:  I was like, oh, this is one of those things where like, you know, they're

1206
01:13:54,205 --> 01:13:57,085
Speaker 3:  like covering it up so we don't see Yeah, it's, but no, that's a

1207
01:13:57,725 --> 01:13:58,285
Speaker 3:  screen's

1208
01:13:58,285 --> 01:14:01,885
Speaker 7:  A legit screen. Oh my God. Like a full on display. Like we have to, you know,

1209
01:14:02,025 --> 01:14:05,485
Speaker 7:  get, you know, our TV reviewers on this immediately because this is gonna

1210
01:14:05,485 --> 01:14:07,405
Speaker 7:  be the next big tv. I I'm, I'm,

1211
01:14:07,465 --> 01:14:10,045
Speaker 3:  Can you assuming, can you watch like Top Gun on this?

1212
01:14:10,185 --> 01:14:12,165
Speaker 7:  You can watch Top Chef on home. Oh

1213
01:14:12,165 --> 01:14:14,965
Speaker 3:  Yeah. Right in front of the minivan.

1214
01:14:14,965 --> 01:14:18,405
Speaker 7:  Obviously this is a terrible idea. 'cause if you think about if you're driving

1215
01:14:18,565 --> 01:14:22,485
Speaker 7:  a vehicle, what often happens is the, the front of your vehicle gets very

1216
01:14:22,485 --> 01:14:26,365
Speaker 7:  dirty. It gets covered in bugs that gets chipped pebbles and rocks

1217
01:14:26,365 --> 01:14:29,205
Speaker 7:  and other things, you know, fly up in the face of it. It's, it's not something

1218
01:14:29,205 --> 01:14:33,125
Speaker 7:  that you can ever really keep completely blemish free. So the idea of

1219
01:14:33,125 --> 01:14:36,685
Speaker 7:  having a a, a cracked screen with broken

1220
01:14:36,785 --> 01:14:39,085
Speaker 7:  pixels all over, it sounds insane to me.

1221
01:14:39,515 --> 01:14:43,365
Speaker 4:  It's called front AI communications ecosystem. Face.

1222
01:14:43,675 --> 01:14:43,965
Speaker 4:  Face.

1223
01:14:44,265 --> 01:14:44,485
Speaker 3:  Oh

1224
01:14:44,485 --> 01:14:47,165
Speaker 7:  Yeah. So this is also like another thing that Fairity Future is always very

1225
01:14:47,165 --> 01:14:50,925
Speaker 7:  good at, which is giving things terrible brand names. So

1226
01:14:50,925 --> 01:14:54,645
Speaker 7:  yeah, the, the F face is a, is an acronym that stands for front

1227
01:14:54,825 --> 01:14:58,725
Speaker 7:  AI communication ecosystem. And you, if you're a business, you can

1228
01:14:58,725 --> 01:15:02,245
Speaker 7:  like project your logo on it. If you're an artist, you can project your

1229
01:15:02,245 --> 01:15:05,805
Speaker 7:  illustrations on it. It, again, I I cannot stress this enough. This

1230
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:08,025
Speaker 7:  will never ship

1231
01:15:08,505 --> 01:15:12,425
Speaker 4:  What happens if you get into a, into a car crash too. When you

1232
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:15,185
Speaker 4:  break your, can you imagine how much that would cost to take

1233
01:15:15,185 --> 01:15:15,985
Speaker 3:  Place? It does, it does a frown,

1234
01:15:15,985 --> 01:15:17,545
Speaker 7:  Right? It does a yeah, it does an out face, right?

1235
01:15:19,685 --> 01:15:23,465
Speaker 3:  It it tells you it's pain level. It's, oh God, I have a question about

1236
01:15:24,025 --> 01:15:27,305
Speaker 3:  I thought minivans were like not cool anymore.

1237
01:15:27,665 --> 01:15:30,865
Speaker 7:  I, well, So if you talk to like auto writers, they all love

1238
01:15:31,185 --> 01:15:34,465
Speaker 7:  minivans. They, you know, they feel like it's a very practical vehicle that

1239
01:15:34,465 --> 01:15:38,385
Speaker 7:  has fallen outta favor with the public as our SUVs

1240
01:15:38,385 --> 01:15:42,225
Speaker 7:  have become larger and more hulking and bigger and, you know, sort of all

1241
01:15:42,225 --> 01:15:45,465
Speaker 7:  those things, you know, the minivan has been sort of like left to the side

1242
01:15:45,465 --> 01:15:49,305
Speaker 7:  to to, to molder. Like, you know, the, the Chrysler Pacifica is like the

1243
01:15:49,305 --> 01:15:52,945
Speaker 7:  only like US based minivan anymore.

1244
01:15:53,055 --> 01:15:56,105
Speaker 7:  There's still like, you know, a few, there's like your Honda Odyssey and

1245
01:15:56,105 --> 01:15:59,705
Speaker 7:  your, your Kia Min minivans, but for the most part min minivan

1246
01:15:59,955 --> 01:16:00,905
Speaker 7:  sales have have

1247
01:16:01,705 --> 01:16:05,105
Speaker 3:  Plunged. So if you, if you are a company that is

1248
01:16:05,545 --> 01:16:09,225
Speaker 3:  swearing, you're gonna make a car and gonna make money on that car,

1249
01:16:10,105 --> 01:16:13,605
Speaker 3:  but you've never made a car, why are you going to minivan first?

1250
01:16:13,965 --> 01:16:17,045
Speaker 7:  I, it's, it really like what it boggles the mind. But that's been sort of

1251
01:16:17,045 --> 01:16:19,725
Speaker 7:  like the theme with Faraday future over the years is that they just, they

1252
01:16:19,725 --> 01:16:23,405
Speaker 7:  don't do things that make sense. This is a company that has been in existence

1253
01:16:23,405 --> 01:16:26,845
Speaker 7:  since 2014, has spent $3 billion

1254
01:16:27,585 --> 01:16:29,695
Speaker 7:  to ship 12 cars.

1255
01:16:30,755 --> 01:16:32,615
Speaker 4:  Oh. You know, that's a great return in our investing.

1256
01:16:32,615 --> 01:16:35,975
Speaker 7:  That that's all that's, it's all gone to like investors and like influencers

1257
01:16:35,975 --> 01:16:39,775
Speaker 7:  basically. This is not a real company. It's, if anything, it's just a, you

1258
01:16:39,975 --> 01:16:42,935
Speaker 7:  know, it's a way to like light a huge pile of cash on fire.

1259
01:16:43,045 --> 01:16:46,895
Speaker 4:  It's a grift. You know what? I respect it. I respect the grift.

1260
01:16:47,295 --> 01:16:47,415
Speaker 4:  I,

1261
01:16:47,495 --> 01:16:50,415
Speaker 7:  I respect that. We need more g grifting in our, in our, we need more minivan

1262
01:16:51,055 --> 01:16:51,215
Speaker 7:  industry.

1263
01:16:51,775 --> 01:16:55,295
Speaker 3:  I do think if they are going to make up a car that they're not really gonna

1264
01:16:55,535 --> 01:16:59,295
Speaker 3:  ship. I think they could have thought bigger. I think not like

1265
01:16:59,295 --> 01:17:02,815
Speaker 3:  physically bigger. The minivan is already quite large. I think they have

1266
01:17:03,415 --> 01:17:06,975
Speaker 3:  a TV on the front and that's where it ends. Right?

1267
01:17:07,045 --> 01:17:10,005
Speaker 4:  Well they have these little reclining chairs in the back with

1268
01:17:10,625 --> 01:17:14,125
Speaker 4:  really poorly photoshopped bottle of wine

1269
01:17:14,665 --> 01:17:16,765
Speaker 4:  to champagne glass. It's so poorly shop.

1270
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:19,205
Speaker 3:  I just learned that there are cars in China that can jump

1271
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:23,135
Speaker 7:  Oh yeah. The BYD. The BYD Listen. Yeah. It's, that's

1272
01:17:23,195 --> 01:17:25,695
Speaker 3:  If you're gonna make a fake car, like promise me

1273
01:17:25,695 --> 01:17:29,615
Speaker 7:  The moon. China, China, very, very ahead of us in the, in the cars that

1274
01:17:29,615 --> 01:17:30,335
Speaker 7:  jump race.

1275
01:17:30,455 --> 01:17:33,495
Speaker 3:  I say as global race, jump in cars, make it to the us.

1276
01:17:34,235 --> 01:17:35,215
Speaker 3:  I'm never leaving my house.

1277
01:17:35,555 --> 01:17:38,855
Speaker 4:  We, I mean that we need those in, in New York of all the potholes, you need

1278
01:17:38,855 --> 01:17:40,535
Speaker 4:  a car that can jump over the potholes.

1279
01:17:40,775 --> 01:17:43,935
Speaker 3:  I I don't think Americans are responsible enough for this. I'm really sorry.

1280
01:17:44,275 --> 01:17:44,495
Speaker 3:  No,

1281
01:17:45,215 --> 01:17:48,815
Speaker 4:  I mean I still, you know, just as you like chaos with liquid glass. Yeah.

1282
01:17:48,855 --> 01:17:49,775
Speaker 4:  I want chaos on the highway.

1283
01:17:50,235 --> 01:17:50,935
Speaker 3:  You want road warrior?

1284
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:51,655
Speaker 4:  I want road.

1285
01:17:51,715 --> 01:17:53,855
Speaker 3:  You're you're full on like ready to go Mad

1286
01:17:54,055 --> 01:17:56,335
Speaker 4:  Magazine. I'm ready to go. Yeah. A beautiful

1287
01:17:56,745 --> 01:17:57,095
Speaker 3:  Twist.

1288
01:17:58,605 --> 01:18:01,375
Speaker 3:  Okay. The, you've got some news for us?

1289
01:18:01,595 --> 01:18:05,375
Speaker 4:  Yes. Amazon has bought BI and

1290
01:18:05,535 --> 01:18:09,215
Speaker 4:  BAI is this wearable that I tested that kind

1291
01:18:09,215 --> 01:18:12,655
Speaker 3:  Of, this is BBEE. Not, not b, EE. Okay. BEE like

1292
01:18:12,655 --> 01:18:13,055
Speaker 7:  Buzz, buzz,

1293
01:18:13,285 --> 01:18:16,255
Speaker 4:  Buzz, buzz. Like, so Yeah. No be by

1294
01:18:16,415 --> 01:18:20,255
Speaker 4:  VI wrote that review. It's basically like

1295
01:18:20,255 --> 01:18:23,775
Speaker 4:  this little Fitbit type thing. And it listens to you always.

1296
01:18:24,355 --> 01:18:28,215
Speaker 4:  And it's basically supposed to be your AI memory. And it

1297
01:18:28,215 --> 01:18:31,735
Speaker 4:  wrote fan fiction about my life. It recorded some very

1298
01:18:31,735 --> 01:18:35,575
Speaker 4:  embarrassing moments. Like when I went And I had a particularly

1299
01:18:36,085 --> 01:18:40,015
Speaker 4:  healthy bowel movement And I looked back And I went, oh shit. And then

1300
01:18:40,015 --> 01:18:43,895
Speaker 4:  it said v said, oh shit, in this transcript. And

1301
01:18:43,895 --> 01:18:47,655
Speaker 4:  it was making these like to-do lists. It was, it was like truly dystopian.

1302
01:18:47,765 --> 01:18:51,175
Speaker 4:  Good god. It has So it learned so much about you That is

1303
01:18:51,175 --> 01:18:54,775
Speaker 4:  incorrect. Incorrect At the same time. And now

1304
01:18:54,775 --> 01:18:55,695
Speaker 4:  Amazon has bought it.

1305
01:18:55,885 --> 01:18:59,815
Speaker 3:  I've, okay. You've just instantly turned me off of everything about

1306
01:18:59,815 --> 01:19:03,655
Speaker 3:  this. Like, I just always listening, but on

1307
01:19:03,655 --> 01:19:05,855
Speaker 3:  you, like what? No, yeah.

1308
01:19:05,855 --> 01:19:09,455
Speaker 4:  This is like this new class. It's not of AI wearables where it's just like

1309
01:19:09,455 --> 01:19:12,815
Speaker 4:  listening and we'll create transcriptions and this takes it a bit further

1310
01:19:12,815 --> 01:19:16,255
Speaker 4:  because it'll, it'll the promises that like, oh, that thing you said you

1311
01:19:16,255 --> 01:19:19,855
Speaker 4:  were gonna do, that you forgot to do. It's in a to-do list that it created

1312
01:19:19,885 --> 01:19:23,095
Speaker 4:  because it's listening to you all the time.

1313
01:19:24,075 --> 01:19:25,895
Speaker 4:  All the time. All the time.

1314
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:29,735
Speaker 7:  I feel like that's the thing that most people say that they don't want from

1315
01:19:29,735 --> 01:19:33,655
Speaker 7:  their technology. Yeah. You know, given the sort of the pro prominence

1316
01:19:33,655 --> 01:19:37,255
Speaker 7:  of the, you know, various conspiracy theories about people's phones listening

1317
01:19:37,255 --> 01:19:40,615
Speaker 7:  to them and how, how that makes people feel. Like why would you actively

1318
01:19:40,675 --> 01:19:41,535
Speaker 7:  buy something that does

1319
01:19:41,535 --> 01:19:45,415
Speaker 4:  This? You know? 'cause I, I really do think there's a forgetful contingent

1320
01:19:45,465 --> 01:19:48,735
Speaker 4:  among us and like people who want these like, notes

1321
01:19:49,625 --> 01:19:52,935
Speaker 4:  taken. But like thi this thing couldn't tell that I was not

1322
01:19:53,695 --> 01:19:57,575
Speaker 4:  Philadelphia school teacher working at Abbott Elementary. Oh. So it was telling

1323
01:19:57,635 --> 01:20:01,615
Speaker 4:  me things like, get ready your classroom for the SEPTA strike. And those

1324
01:20:01,615 --> 01:20:05,175
Speaker 4:  were just like things that were populating my to-do list. But you know, to

1325
01:20:05,175 --> 01:20:09,085
Speaker 4:  your point, Amazon got into a bunch of trouble a number of

1326
01:20:09,085 --> 01:20:12,525
Speaker 4:  years back. 'cause the Echo was listening to everything. And you know, like

1327
01:20:12,525 --> 01:20:16,165
Speaker 4:  I've, I've spoken with the people who've made b they, like, when I wrote

1328
01:20:16,165 --> 01:20:19,205
Speaker 4:  my review, they were like, oh, privacy is at the forefront. And I'm just

1329
01:20:19,205 --> 01:20:23,195
Speaker 4:  like, well, we don't know how much Amazon bought B for, but

1330
01:20:23,195 --> 01:20:27,075
Speaker 4:  this is the big first. Like this is the first big tech company that's buying

1331
01:20:27,075 --> 01:20:28,995
Speaker 4:  these, always listening AI devices.

1332
01:20:31,065 --> 01:20:34,955
Speaker 3:  Yeah. This is like a very confusing acquisition to me. It like,

1333
01:20:35,795 --> 01:20:39,275
Speaker 3:  I understand that there are a lot of tech companies looking at AI being like,

1334
01:20:39,275 --> 01:20:42,395
Speaker 3:  we gotta do an AI gadget, we gotta do something. And it does seem like the

1335
01:20:42,395 --> 01:20:45,875
Speaker 3:  current idea is just like, oh, I'll just listen to you all the time. So like,

1336
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:49,775
Speaker 3:  okay. I I, I'll give that to them even though I think it's not the right

1337
01:20:49,775 --> 01:20:53,495
Speaker 3:  idea and seems unpleasant. But this, this, the

1338
01:20:53,735 --> 01:20:57,455
Speaker 3:  hardware and the software of this fundamentally don't seem very good.

1339
01:20:57,745 --> 01:21:01,215
Speaker 3:  Right? Like Amazon could just make this themselves. Why do they need to buy

1340
01:21:01,215 --> 01:21:04,255
Speaker 3:  this? It is, it's just a little, it's just a little thing around your wrist

1341
01:21:04,255 --> 01:21:04,935
Speaker 3:  with a microphone.

1342
01:21:05,045 --> 01:21:07,735
Speaker 4:  It's a little thing around. Or you could wear it as like a clip. I wear it

1343
01:21:07,735 --> 01:21:10,775
Speaker 4:  mostly as a pendant because I have limited wrist real estate at any given

1344
01:21:10,775 --> 01:21:14,735
Speaker 4:  point in time. But yeah, I think it's just the,

1345
01:21:14,755 --> 01:21:17,775
Speaker 4:  the concept of what they're doing, you know, they're saying Alexa plus is

1346
01:21:17,775 --> 01:21:21,655
Speaker 4:  gonna be agentic and they call b something that's about to be

1347
01:21:21,725 --> 01:21:25,255
Speaker 4:  agentic. I don't, there's like this a

1348
01:21:25,355 --> 01:21:29,135
Speaker 4:  aspect of you talking and it automatically adding things to a

1349
01:21:29,135 --> 01:21:32,815
Speaker 4:  to-do list, which, you know, I went on the New Jersey transit bus and it

1350
01:21:32,815 --> 01:21:35,975
Speaker 4:  was just like, you've got a patient in Louisiana that's about to die, make

1351
01:21:35,975 --> 01:21:39,895
Speaker 4:  sure to check in on them. And I was like, what? No, what does

1352
01:21:39,935 --> 01:21:43,575
Speaker 4:  either someone was watching like a medical drama on this bus And I didn't

1353
01:21:43,575 --> 01:21:47,375
Speaker 4:  hear it, or I just violated someone's HIPAA rights. I

1354
01:21:47,375 --> 01:21:49,215
Speaker 4:  don't know. But I just feel you're

1355
01:21:49,215 --> 01:21:49,335
Speaker 3:  In the,

1356
01:21:49,595 --> 01:21:53,255
Speaker 4:  Now that my conspiracy hat theory is that this has something to do with Alexa.

1357
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:53,615
Speaker 4:  Plus

1358
01:21:55,395 --> 01:21:58,695
Speaker 3:  Amazon clearly wants to put Alexa on the, on your wrist. Right? They've

1359
01:21:58,695 --> 01:22:02,655
Speaker 4:  Been trying to put it on your face, in your microwaves, in, in so many different

1360
01:22:02,655 --> 01:22:06,335
Speaker 4:  ways. So I just feel like they're like, what if we put Alexa in it? And what

1361
01:22:06,335 --> 01:22:09,615
Speaker 4:  if it's listening at all times and it can control your to-do list and then

1362
01:22:09,615 --> 01:22:13,055
Speaker 4:  it can control your like shopping cart. So like, it kind of makes sense to

1363
01:22:13,055 --> 01:22:16,345
Speaker 4:  me, but it also makes me just go like, oh no,

1364
01:22:17,655 --> 01:22:18,625
Speaker 3:  It's coming for you. Oh

1365
01:22:18,645 --> 01:22:22,585
Speaker 4:  No. B by V in like 20 years is

1366
01:22:22,585 --> 01:22:25,745
Speaker 4:  just gonna be like, Alexa writing fan fiction about my life and all the things

1367
01:22:25,745 --> 01:22:29,425
Speaker 4:  that it misinterprets. Like you should have seen the transfix it had when

1368
01:22:29,425 --> 01:22:31,185
Speaker 4:  I was watching severance. Oh. And I could not

1369
01:22:31,185 --> 01:22:32,625
Speaker 3:  Tell, tell honestly Severance

1370
01:22:32,695 --> 01:22:36,505
Speaker 4:  From my life. And it was just like, oh, the numbers are

1371
01:22:36,505 --> 01:22:37,545
Speaker 4:  important and mysterious.

1372
01:22:38,045 --> 01:22:40,945
Speaker 3:  How does it even tell you? Like it doesn't have a speaker. Right? You're,

1373
01:22:40,945 --> 01:22:42,465
Speaker 3:  you have to check another app. This

1374
01:22:42,465 --> 01:22:44,345
Speaker 4:  Doesn't Yeah, there's a companion app and it

1375
01:22:44,345 --> 01:22:44,825
Speaker 3:  Doesn't feel like

1376
01:22:44,825 --> 01:22:48,785
Speaker 4:  It collects all the stuff. It has like fact Tinder. So

1377
01:22:48,875 --> 01:22:51,185
Speaker 4:  it'll learn stuff about you and you have to verify things.

1378
01:22:51,485 --> 01:22:55,305
Speaker 3:  Oh my God, yes. You swipe whether it is accurately surveilling you.

1379
01:22:55,565 --> 01:22:58,785
Speaker 3:  Yes. Hmm. That's disturbing. It's,

1380
01:22:59,145 --> 01:23:03,105
Speaker 4:  I got a lot of really funny fact genders, which you can check my B by V

1381
01:23:03,105 --> 01:23:07,085
Speaker 4:  review. And you can see that it thought that I knew someone named Kendrick,

1382
01:23:07,305 --> 01:23:10,125
Speaker 4:  Kendra Monisha because I was listening to the Kendrick album.

1383
01:23:10,995 --> 01:23:14,885
Speaker 3:  Well, okay. Room for improvement, room for a lot. Good luck to

1384
01:23:14,885 --> 01:23:18,365
Speaker 3:  Amazon with that one. And right under the,

1385
01:23:18,945 --> 01:23:19,165
Speaker 4:  We

1386
01:23:19,165 --> 01:23:22,085
Speaker 3:  Did it right under the, we did it. Yeah. Almost got there. Almost. Got it.

1387
01:23:22,085 --> 01:23:25,245
Speaker 3:  Okay. Big shelter. I've got one for you. This week

1388
01:23:25,735 --> 01:23:29,525
Speaker 3:  Apple launched a new service called AppleCare one

1389
01:23:30,095 --> 01:23:33,765
Speaker 3:  Apple. I think if you guys have been paying attention to, to their earnings,

1390
01:23:34,555 --> 01:23:38,205
Speaker 3:  they, they love services, they love recurring revenue. Right. And they're

1391
01:23:38,205 --> 01:23:41,445
Speaker 3:  turning everything into a subscription among us. I do, I do. This is actually

1392
01:23:41,515 --> 01:23:45,405
Speaker 3:  love it. I mean, we have subscription service, if not a,

1393
01:23:45,485 --> 01:23:47,165
Speaker 3:  a recurring subscription.

1394
01:23:47,525 --> 01:23:48,405
Speaker 4:  Subscribe to the rich.com

1395
01:23:48,425 --> 01:23:49,725
Speaker 3:  To, to pe. Yeah.

1396
01:23:51,665 --> 01:23:55,285
Speaker 3:  So Apple Service, you pay $20 a month and they'll offer,

1397
01:23:55,705 --> 01:23:59,485
Speaker 3:  you know, warranty, extended warranty protection coverage for I think like

1398
01:23:59,505 --> 01:24:03,465
Speaker 3:  any three of your Apple gadgets. And there's some restrictions and

1399
01:24:03,465 --> 01:24:07,145
Speaker 3:  it's the max is three, three max is three. You can add more for $6 each.

1400
01:24:07,285 --> 01:24:10,305
Speaker 3:  No. And I think maybe the, the deal starts getting worse. And so it's very

1401
01:24:10,505 --> 01:24:13,825
Speaker 3:  interesting because some people it's $20 flat.

1402
01:24:14,255 --> 01:24:17,825
Speaker 3:  Some people, if you're the kind of person who wants a warranty, are gonna

1403
01:24:17,825 --> 01:24:20,825
Speaker 3:  make out, do you know how much the warranty is on

1404
01:24:21,905 --> 01:24:23,345
Speaker 3:  a Vision Pro? If you're paying by month

1405
01:24:23,905 --> 01:24:24,185
Speaker 4:  A lot,

1406
01:24:24,405 --> 01:24:28,345
Speaker 3:  It is $25. So you're immediately saving $5 a month

1407
01:24:28,365 --> 01:24:31,345
Speaker 3:  and covering two other gadgets. If you're a Vision Pro person. And listen,

1408
01:24:31,345 --> 01:24:34,025
Speaker 3:  if you're a Vision Pro person who's like, you want that throwing this thing

1409
01:24:34,025 --> 01:24:35,705
Speaker 3:  around town, oh yeah, okay,

1410
01:24:35,975 --> 01:24:39,905
Speaker 4:  Well you, you want it Because like they, like when I had my first Vision

1411
01:24:40,045 --> 01:24:43,465
Speaker 4:  Pro demos, they were like, you have to pick it up a specific way, my God.

1412
01:24:43,465 --> 01:24:46,865
Speaker 4:  Because it, God attaches by magnets. Like the, the different, the light seals

1413
01:24:46,985 --> 01:24:50,305
Speaker 4:  attached by magnets. So if you're not careful and then that glass screen

1414
01:24:50,325 --> 01:24:54,265
Speaker 4:  is gonna go and then that's $3,500 down, down the

1415
01:24:54,265 --> 01:24:58,025
Speaker 4:  hole. That's rough. But not if you have, if you're shaving $5

1416
01:24:58,205 --> 01:24:59,305
Speaker 4:  on this Apple one,

1417
01:24:59,485 --> 01:25:02,665
Speaker 3:  You still gotta pay, you still gotta pay the, the service fee. So, okay.

1418
01:25:03,165 --> 01:25:06,145
Speaker 3:  It is less of a deal if you're, if you're covering cheaper gadgets. Right.

1419
01:25:06,145 --> 01:25:09,025
Speaker 3:  If it's just your phone, your laptop, your AirPods, you're like maybe breaking

1420
01:25:09,025 --> 01:25:12,905
Speaker 3:  even. Here's my question though. Do are either of you like extended warranty

1421
01:25:12,905 --> 01:25:15,265
Speaker 3:  people? 'cause I, I'm always like, I'm not taking it like

1422
01:25:15,665 --> 01:25:19,505
Speaker 4:  I didn't for a long time. And then Butterfinger v

1423
01:25:19,635 --> 01:25:23,585
Speaker 4:  McGee dropped her phone, three phones in

1424
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:26,705
Speaker 4:  a row cracked the screens. And I was like,

1425
01:25:27,755 --> 01:25:31,375
Speaker 4:  oh no. And I tried to go, I'm like, fix screen please. And they were like,

1426
01:25:31,555 --> 01:25:35,455
Speaker 4:  ha ha, no, you don't have a warranty. So for a number of years I did,

1427
01:25:35,755 --> 01:25:37,095
Speaker 4:  but it has since expired.

1428
01:25:37,635 --> 01:25:40,735
Speaker 3:  See, that would do it. That would, I, I'm, I'm always like, I'm gonna take

1429
01:25:40,735 --> 01:25:44,455
Speaker 3:  this risk because with Apple in particular, like, you gotta pay for the warranty

1430
01:25:44,475 --> 01:25:47,295
Speaker 3:  and then you gotta pay for the service on top of that. And I'm like,

1431
01:25:48,615 --> 01:25:49,215
Speaker 4:  I think I

1432
01:25:49,215 --> 01:25:49,535
Speaker 3:  Gamble

1433
01:25:49,535 --> 01:25:53,415
Speaker 4:  This. I let my extended warranty expire. So when I went to

1434
01:25:53,415 --> 01:25:57,335
Speaker 4:  replace the battery on my 14 Pro Max, I was

1435
01:25:57,335 --> 01:26:00,535
Speaker 4:  like, three battery please. And they're like, it's expired. So

1436
01:26:01,035 --> 01:26:03,645
Speaker 4:  $100 please. I was was like, ah, I

1437
01:26:03,645 --> 01:26:07,085
Speaker 7:  I I have a question about the warranties. As, as you know, we have these,

1438
01:26:07,185 --> 01:26:11,125
Speaker 7:  you know, right. To repair, there's the right to repair movement,

1439
01:26:11,125 --> 01:26:14,685
Speaker 7:  right. And there's states that are adopting laws around right. To repair

1440
01:26:15,785 --> 01:26:19,045
Speaker 7:  and the Apple and the other tech companies are pushing back against it. I'm

1441
01:26:19,045 --> 01:26:22,645
Speaker 7:  curious to see if we get like, sort of widespread

1442
01:26:23,135 --> 01:26:26,965
Speaker 7:  right. To repair approvals, you know, maybe even like on a national

1443
01:26:26,965 --> 01:26:30,925
Speaker 7:  level, like what that would mean for like a warranty or like long term.

1444
01:26:30,925 --> 01:26:34,285
Speaker 7:  Because if you've, if you're suddenly you're like, you know, you can like

1445
01:26:34,285 --> 01:26:37,245
Speaker 7:  update your battery, you can like update your screen over the years. Like,

1446
01:26:37,465 --> 01:26:41,165
Speaker 7:  you know, maybe that warranty becomes a lot more useful or a lot more valuable

1447
01:26:41,165 --> 01:26:43,885
Speaker 7:  to have if you can like, do these things to your phone that people typically

1448
01:26:43,885 --> 01:26:44,325
Speaker 7:  haven't done.

1449
01:26:44,585 --> 01:26:48,285
Speaker 3:  Or I guess like alternatively, I wonder if, if, if those things are really

1450
01:26:48,285 --> 01:26:51,965
Speaker 3:  effective, right? Like maybe you don't need it because you can actually

1451
01:26:52,465 --> 01:26:54,285
Speaker 3:  go kind of anywhere to get it fixed, right?

1452
01:26:54,285 --> 01:26:55,845
Speaker 7:  Yeah. It's like a third party or, yeah. Whereas

1453
01:26:55,845 --> 01:26:59,245
Speaker 3:  Right now, like third party repairs with Apple, like, it's it's very limited's.

1454
01:26:59,245 --> 01:26:59,605
Speaker 3:  So you have to

1455
01:26:59,605 --> 01:27:03,445
Speaker 4:  Go to the authorized repair Yeah. Thingy. And it's like, eh,

1456
01:27:03,795 --> 01:27:07,285
Speaker 3:  They really have a lot of control over it. They do. I, my, my worst I guess

1457
01:27:07,285 --> 01:27:10,525
Speaker 3:  like Apple, like, you know, failure to have coverage story was, I, I had

1458
01:27:10,525 --> 01:27:14,325
Speaker 3:  the first Apple Watch and I was like working out one day and then it was

1459
01:27:14,325 --> 01:27:18,245
Speaker 3:  just like, I'm done. Oh, just, just like, it was like

1460
01:27:18,245 --> 01:27:22,125
Speaker 3:  that they were like, we had a good time and that's, it was only like, like

1461
01:27:22,585 --> 01:27:26,405
Speaker 3:  it was not very old. And so I went to the Apple store and

1462
01:27:26,425 --> 01:27:30,165
Speaker 3:  I'm like, I think like maybe we can just like, you know, reinstall the OS

1463
01:27:30,385 --> 01:27:33,525
Speaker 3:  and they're like, I don't know, we gotta, we gotta send this thing off and

1464
01:27:33,525 --> 01:27:36,405
Speaker 3:  it's out of warranty. I'm like, okay, send it off, see how much it would

1465
01:27:36,405 --> 01:27:40,325
Speaker 3:  cost. And they got back to me, they're like, you can buy a new

1466
01:27:40,325 --> 01:27:44,295
Speaker 3:  Apple watch. And I'm like, well that's, that

1467
01:27:44,295 --> 01:27:45,975
Speaker 3:  was, we had a good, we had a good run.

1468
01:27:46,375 --> 01:27:48,815
Speaker 7:  I mean that's ultimately what they want you to do. They just want you to

1469
01:27:48,815 --> 01:27:49,375
Speaker 7:  keep buying new product.

1470
01:27:49,375 --> 01:27:50,015
Speaker 3:  These new

1471
01:27:50,015 --> 01:27:53,775
Speaker 4:  Products are the, the watchOS in particularly are really hard to repair anyway.

1472
01:27:53,775 --> 01:27:57,215
Speaker 4:  Yeah. So anytime anything breaks, they're basically gonna be like, how would

1473
01:27:57,215 --> 01:27:58,255
Speaker 4:  you like a new watch? Yeah.

1474
01:27:58,695 --> 01:28:01,895
Speaker 7:  I, that's the thing. I don't think these devices would look the same if we

1475
01:28:01,915 --> 01:28:05,295
Speaker 7:  had some, you know, some sort of widespread repairability, you know, like

1476
01:28:05,295 --> 01:28:05,575
Speaker 7:  mandate

1477
01:28:05,795 --> 01:28:09,175
Speaker 3:  That's very real. Like I think, you know, if you look at the Fairphone,

1478
01:28:10,095 --> 01:28:13,415
Speaker 3:  actually it is getting a lot nicer looking. But I do think a lot of these

1479
01:28:13,415 --> 01:28:16,695
Speaker 3:  parable gadgets, like they kinda, you know, chunky, they gotta make their

1480
01:28:16,695 --> 01:28:19,095
Speaker 3:  trade offs. They gotta make their trade offs. They chunky and some of 'em

1481
01:28:19,095 --> 01:28:22,255
Speaker 3:  will, they, they do it and they look nice And I think like Apple, like they're

1482
01:28:22,255 --> 01:28:26,175
Speaker 3:  not gonna make that trade. Which, you know, they,

1483
01:28:26,175 --> 01:28:28,695
Speaker 3:  they want to give you a reason to keep paying them money. Right. That's,

1484
01:28:28,695 --> 01:28:32,535
Speaker 3:  that's great for them. I'm gonna keep taking the risk. Yeah. I don't think

1485
01:28:32,535 --> 01:28:33,015
Speaker 3:  I'm, but if you're

1486
01:28:33,165 --> 01:28:33,855
Speaker 7:  Sign up for this,

1487
01:28:34,155 --> 01:28:36,615
Speaker 3:  But Vision Pro early adopters. Yeah.

1488
01:28:36,615 --> 01:28:39,415
Speaker 7:  If you have the expensive, this is your moment stuff, it seems like it might

1489
01:28:39,415 --> 01:28:40,975
Speaker 7:  be a worthwhile thing to sign up for.

1490
01:28:41,785 --> 01:28:43,025
Speaker 4:  I just think you have to map it out.

1491
01:28:43,525 --> 01:28:47,345
Speaker 3:  You got Yes. Very real. We go very real. Okay. Andy? Yes.

1492
01:28:47,455 --> 01:28:47,825
Speaker 3:  What have

1493
01:28:47,825 --> 01:28:50,825
Speaker 7:  You got? Pro us. All right. Next one is that Uber announced

1494
01:28:51,615 --> 01:28:55,425
Speaker 7:  that it was rolling out a new feature that it's had in

1495
01:28:55,905 --> 01:28:59,625
Speaker 7:  a lot of other countries, but now it's gonna be coming to the us It's a,

1496
01:28:59,745 --> 01:29:03,685
Speaker 7:  a a, a driver preference and a rider preference feature for women. So

1497
01:29:03,685 --> 01:29:07,485
Speaker 7:  if you are a woman who uses Uber and you would prefer

1498
01:29:07,505 --> 01:29:11,325
Speaker 7:  to ride with a woman driver, you can set that preference now in the

1499
01:29:11,325 --> 01:29:14,965
Speaker 7:  Uber app. Hell yes. And vice versa, a driver, if you're a woman who drives

1500
01:29:14,965 --> 01:29:17,765
Speaker 7:  for Uber and you'd wanna prefer to have women passengers, you could set that

1501
01:29:17,765 --> 01:29:21,365
Speaker 7:  preference as well. Uber acknowledges this is likely to

1502
01:29:21,725 --> 01:29:25,565
Speaker 7:  increase wait times because the idea as of today, the vast majority of

1503
01:29:25,565 --> 01:29:29,445
Speaker 7:  Uber drivers are men. It's something like three to one. But

1504
01:29:29,985 --> 01:29:33,405
Speaker 7:  it, it does seem like, you know, they rolled this out to, in Saudi Arabia

1505
01:29:33,515 --> 01:29:37,445
Speaker 7:  many years ago, it was very popular and then it, they brought it

1506
01:29:37,445 --> 01:29:40,925
Speaker 7:  to other countries in Europe and Asia and now it's coming to the us. It's

1507
01:29:40,925 --> 01:29:44,405
Speaker 7:  gonna be in Los Angeles, Detroit and San Francisco. And then they're gonna

1508
01:29:44,405 --> 01:29:46,885
Speaker 7:  try to roll it out across the, the rest of the country. After that.

1509
01:29:47,525 --> 01:29:51,165
Speaker 4:  I would love if you could make it so that after a certain time of day

1510
01:29:51,505 --> 01:29:55,285
Speaker 4:  you could switch who you want driving you. Because I have had some

1511
01:29:56,445 --> 01:29:58,535
Speaker 4:  dicey Uber drivers in the past.

1512
01:29:58,635 --> 01:29:59,815
Speaker 7:  You are not alone in

1513
01:29:59,815 --> 01:30:03,615
Speaker 4:  Past experience. I, I've had some dicey Uber drivers in the past. Like I've,

1514
01:30:03,875 --> 01:30:07,735
Speaker 4:  you know, also had situations where like our Uber

1515
01:30:07,795 --> 01:30:10,575
Speaker 4:  was stuck in traffic and then I got a phone call because they were like,

1516
01:30:10,575 --> 01:30:14,215
Speaker 4:  you've been stuck in traffic, are you safe? Are you gonna be like un alive?

1517
01:30:14,435 --> 01:30:17,535
Speaker 4:  And I was like, oh, that happened to me recently actually. Yeah. And I was

1518
01:30:17,535 --> 01:30:21,055
Speaker 4:  like, oh, well that makes me feel slightly better,

1519
01:30:21,435 --> 01:30:25,335
Speaker 4:  but also not at the same time. And I will

1520
01:30:25,475 --> 01:30:29,455
Speaker 4:  say that I think road rage is less common in the New York City

1521
01:30:29,455 --> 01:30:32,735
Speaker 4:  area when I've had women drivers. Yeah. Oh yeah. Just the

1522
01:30:32,975 --> 01:30:34,255
Speaker 4:  GWB pissing.

1523
01:30:34,355 --> 01:30:37,135
Speaker 7:  No, yeah. Pissing my driver off physically women are safer drivers than men

1524
01:30:37,135 --> 01:30:40,615
Speaker 7:  in a lot of, a lot of mar a lot of cities in the countries. Yeah, it's, you

1525
01:30:40,615 --> 01:30:44,335
Speaker 7:  know, I think it, what it does is it speaks to a larger problem that Uber's

1526
01:30:44,335 --> 01:30:48,135
Speaker 7:  been having and Lyft as well. And just really anyone in the ride hail

1527
01:30:48,445 --> 01:30:51,535
Speaker 7:  taxi business, which is that assaults, sexual assaults,

1528
01:30:51,945 --> 01:30:55,695
Speaker 7:  harassment, violence still a big problem in this industry.

1529
01:30:56,855 --> 01:31:00,655
Speaker 7:  I, I think in its last report that was, that was released in

1530
01:31:00,655 --> 01:31:04,415
Speaker 7:  2024 Uber Safety Report covering the years of 2021 and

1531
01:31:04,415 --> 01:31:07,935
Speaker 7:  2022, there were 2,717

1532
01:31:09,255 --> 01:31:12,655
Speaker 7:  incidents of serious, serious sexual assault and misconduct

1533
01:31:13,115 --> 01:31:16,975
Speaker 7:  in its vehicles. This is either drivers assaulting passengers,

1534
01:31:16,975 --> 01:31:20,575
Speaker 7:  passengers assaulting drivers, that's down from the previous period,

1535
01:31:20,755 --> 01:31:24,015
Speaker 7:  but still a, a big problem for the company. And they're trying to like, make

1536
01:31:24,015 --> 01:31:25,975
Speaker 7:  things safer overall it seems like for people.

1537
01:31:26,375 --> 01:31:30,215
Speaker 3:  I do wonder if on if on a long enough timeline, this could

1538
01:31:30,415 --> 01:31:33,895
Speaker 3:  actually increase the number of women who are driving for Uber. I think it

1539
01:31:33,895 --> 01:31:37,815
Speaker 3:  could, right? Yeah. Because now there is a specific audience for

1540
01:31:37,815 --> 01:31:41,295
Speaker 3:  them and they're going to presumably have a safer time

1541
01:31:41,655 --> 01:31:44,975
Speaker 3:  driving. I I cannot in memory,

1542
01:31:45,515 --> 01:31:47,935
Speaker 3:  you know, remember having a woman driving Uber

1543
01:31:48,255 --> 01:31:48,695
Speaker 4:  Really? That I've got.

1544
01:31:48,805 --> 01:31:49,095
Speaker 3:  Yeah,

1545
01:31:49,125 --> 01:31:49,855
Speaker 4:  I've got, I've

1546
01:31:49,855 --> 01:31:52,775
Speaker 7:  Had a lot recently. I've had a few too. Okay. Yeah. Okay. But no, it is,

1547
01:31:52,795 --> 01:31:56,455
Speaker 7:  it is certainly the case that for, for women who drive for Uber,

1548
01:31:56,795 --> 01:32:00,365
Speaker 7:  you know, we ran a, a feature in 2022, which I would encourage you to read.

1549
01:32:00,425 --> 01:32:04,085
Speaker 7:  It is a extremely tough read. But we, the

1550
01:32:04,285 --> 01:32:08,045
Speaker 7:  reporter who's, whose name, hold on, let me see what

1551
01:32:08,675 --> 01:32:12,525
Speaker 7:  Anna bets. She wrote this story, this is a great story. She interviewed

1552
01:32:12,525 --> 01:32:15,845
Speaker 7:  like a dozen women who write, who drive for Uber and Lyft. And the stories

1553
01:32:15,845 --> 01:32:19,805
Speaker 7:  that they told were horrifying. Horrifying. Just, you know, I'm sorry to

1554
01:32:19,805 --> 01:32:23,365
Speaker 7:  say, but men are terrible in many, many

1555
01:32:23,405 --> 01:32:27,045
Speaker 7:  contexts and one of which is in an Uber vehicle. So,

1556
01:32:27,465 --> 01:32:30,325
Speaker 7:  you know, she talked to these women, you know, and, and you don't, you can't

1557
01:32:30,355 --> 01:32:34,125
Speaker 7:  imagine it's, or it's, it's easy to imagine

1558
01:32:34,265 --> 01:32:37,765
Speaker 7:  why more women don't, don't drive for these services because of how horrible

1559
01:32:37,765 --> 01:32:41,645
Speaker 7:  these experiences are. So I do think it could have the, the, the knock on

1560
01:32:41,645 --> 01:32:44,365
Speaker 7:  effect of of getting more women to sign up to drive the

1561
01:32:44,365 --> 01:32:47,565
Speaker 3:  Hope is that it's just still a good enough experience in the meantime. Because

1562
01:32:47,565 --> 01:32:51,125
Speaker 3:  like, I I mean honestly the wait times are are rough in general

1563
01:32:51,125 --> 01:32:55,045
Speaker 3:  sometimes. Yeah. And if you have to wait for one of a, a subset of

1564
01:32:55,045 --> 01:32:55,365
Speaker 3:  drivers,

1565
01:32:56,325 --> 01:33:00,125
Speaker 4:  I wish, I wish it could be just like, yes, that's my preference. But if there

1566
01:33:00,185 --> 01:33:02,245
Speaker 4:  are none within you can Yes. This time period,

1567
01:33:02,715 --> 01:33:03,725
Speaker 7:  Then just they do let you,

1568
01:33:04,035 --> 01:33:06,285
Speaker 4:  I'll, I'll I'll accept a man. Yeah.

1569
01:33:06,285 --> 01:33:09,605
Speaker 7:  Like they say that you can, you can, as you're hailing the ride, you can

1570
01:33:09,605 --> 01:33:13,125
Speaker 7:  say, I'd like this to be a woman. And that's also the case that

1571
01:33:13,955 --> 01:33:16,845
Speaker 7:  Uber, you, you have to verify your identity. So they're making sure that

1572
01:33:16,865 --> 01:33:20,765
Speaker 7:  men are not like fall asleep. Oh right. Impersonating to, to ensure,

1573
01:33:20,765 --> 01:33:23,365
Speaker 7:  you know, to that they're not, you know, and if, if something like that happens,

1574
01:33:23,365 --> 01:33:26,165
Speaker 7:  they encourage people to report it to Uber and they'll kick them off the

1575
01:33:26,165 --> 01:33:29,805
Speaker 7:  app essentially. But yeah, they are they, if they say that, if it, if you

1576
01:33:29,805 --> 01:33:33,565
Speaker 7:  see the wait time and it's like, you know, an hour until your car comes versus,

1577
01:33:33,745 --> 01:33:37,485
Speaker 7:  you know, two minutes for Joe to driver to to swing by, maybe

1578
01:33:37,485 --> 01:33:41,445
Speaker 4:  Sometimes you'll take that risk. 'cause my last Uber driver, I will

1579
01:33:41,465 --> 01:33:44,845
Speaker 4:  say I do feel like a female Uber driver would have a better smelling Uber.

1580
01:33:45,205 --> 01:33:49,045
Speaker 4:  'cause the last Uber I got into the man I got in And I was like,

1581
01:33:49,105 --> 01:33:52,765
Speaker 4:  he clearly cro dusted right before I got in. And this is

1582
01:33:53,025 --> 01:33:56,365
Speaker 7:  Not good. This is the most scatological Vergecast I've ever done.

1583
01:33:57,705 --> 01:34:00,085
Speaker 7:  No, but it's, I think it's also what it speaks to that's interesting to me.

1584
01:34:00,115 --> 01:34:03,245
Speaker 7:  Just to wrap it up is that, you know, Uber thought since the beginning that

1585
01:34:03,245 --> 01:34:06,205
Speaker 7:  this like five star system was gonna be the end all be all. You, you, you

1586
01:34:06,205 --> 01:34:09,445
Speaker 7:  rate the driver, they rate you and this is gonna weed out all of like the

1587
01:34:09,445 --> 01:34:12,885
Speaker 7:  bad apples. Clearly that has not worked out at all.

1588
01:34:13,265 --> 01:34:17,045
Speaker 7:  And if anything it has offered more opportunities for predators and other

1589
01:34:17,045 --> 01:34:20,845
Speaker 7:  people who, you know, commit these types of violence to to, to continue to

1590
01:34:20,845 --> 01:34:24,005
Speaker 7:  do so. So you know, hopefully as they continue to tweak these features, we

1591
01:34:24,005 --> 01:34:26,525
Speaker 7:  can see some more safety in the system. Alright,

1592
01:34:27,085 --> 01:34:29,005
Speaker 3:  D you've got one last story to wrap us

1593
01:34:29,005 --> 01:34:30,125
Speaker 4:  Up. Labu Booo.

1594
01:34:30,355 --> 01:34:31,325
Speaker 7:  Hell yeah. Let's go

1595
01:34:31,355 --> 01:34:35,245
Speaker 4:  Baby la boos. Let's go into La boo boos. So Mia wrote

1596
01:34:35,445 --> 01:34:39,405
Speaker 4:  a really great just writeup of how hard it is to get a

1597
01:34:39,475 --> 01:34:43,245
Speaker 4:  Labu booo and how these little freaky ass

1598
01:34:43,355 --> 01:34:47,165
Speaker 4:  toys have gotten so popular in the last few months. And

1599
01:34:47,585 --> 01:34:51,365
Speaker 4:  you know, I am not saying that I wanted a Labu Booo,

1600
01:34:52,185 --> 01:34:55,765
Speaker 4:  but having read this and watched the social video, I

1601
01:34:55,765 --> 01:34:58,285
Speaker 4:  definitely do not have it in me. Okay. To get a

1602
01:34:58,315 --> 01:35:01,885
Speaker 3:  Labu boo. Can I just ask you really, really quickly? I, I refused,

1603
01:35:02,555 --> 01:35:05,645
Speaker 3:  refused to learn what a what a labu boo is for the longest time.

1604
01:35:06,595 --> 01:35:07,445
Speaker 3:  What is a labu?

1605
01:35:07,965 --> 01:35:11,885
Speaker 4:  A labu boo is a creepy

1606
01:35:11,885 --> 01:35:15,565
Speaker 4:  little doll that has these little ears and they're fuzzy on the

1607
01:35:15,565 --> 01:35:18,565
Speaker 4:  outside and they have these little angry toothy

1608
01:35:19,415 --> 01:35:23,325
Speaker 4:  grins. They're, they're part of the subsect of thing

1609
01:35:23,325 --> 01:35:27,205
Speaker 4:  that, like the Japanese term for it is Kim Kauai, which is like ugly,

1610
01:35:27,315 --> 01:35:31,245
Speaker 4:  cute. So they're ugly, but they're kind of cute and they're just the,

1611
01:35:31,355 --> 01:35:35,085
Speaker 4:  they're, they're the next collectible craze. People are going crazy

1612
01:35:35,145 --> 01:35:38,725
Speaker 4:  for them. Like blind boxes. If you've ever had a blind box, which is like

1613
01:35:38,725 --> 01:35:41,725
Speaker 4:  a little box that you go at, like these stores,

1614
01:35:41,725 --> 01:35:43,685
Speaker 7:  That seems to be the thing that is really driving the craze

1615
01:35:43,905 --> 01:35:44,965
Speaker 4:  Is the, yeah, they're blind.

1616
01:35:44,985 --> 01:35:45,205
Speaker 7:  The

1617
01:35:45,205 --> 01:35:48,045
Speaker 4:  Mystery of it. It's a mystery of it. It's a little box. You can get one of

1618
01:35:48,525 --> 01:35:51,525
Speaker 4:  X amounts of figurines. You open it and you're like, oh, what a surprise.

1619
01:35:51,665 --> 01:35:55,645
Speaker 4:  And then it like triggers into this primal collective

1620
01:35:55,645 --> 01:35:59,525
Speaker 4:  urge that you gotta get 'em all like a Pokemon. So people are just going

1621
01:35:59,635 --> 01:36:03,005
Speaker 4:  nuts over these labu boos to the point where they're so hard and it's like

1622
01:36:03,405 --> 01:36:06,685
Speaker 4:  artificial scarcity, right? So they're so hard to get. There's labu boo drops

1623
01:36:06,685 --> 01:36:09,845
Speaker 4:  and people are just trying to get these labu boos. But they're also, that

1624
01:36:09,845 --> 01:36:13,405
Speaker 7:  Was a thing that floored me watching Mia's video, right? The drop aspect.

1625
01:36:13,475 --> 01:36:16,565
Speaker 4:  There's like a drop and you have to like insane go into this app and you

1626
01:36:16,565 --> 01:36:16,765
Speaker 4:  can't

1627
01:36:16,765 --> 01:36:18,525
Speaker 7:  Trust Too many times it was gamified basically.

1628
01:36:18,525 --> 01:36:22,285
Speaker 4:  It was gamified. Yeah. But you know, at a point that I really

1629
01:36:22,285 --> 01:36:26,245
Speaker 4:  liked was that some people just don't care. So they get Laos and La

1630
01:36:26,545 --> 01:36:30,005
Speaker 4:  Fus are the es they're like the, the knockoffs.

1631
01:36:30,625 --> 01:36:33,765
Speaker 4:  So now I like, I see these tiktoks all the time and people are like, mm,

1632
01:36:33,765 --> 01:36:37,285
Speaker 4:  that's not a labu boo. That's a la foo. And they're like, don't insult my

1633
01:36:37,435 --> 01:36:41,365
Speaker 4:  labu boo. That's a labu boo. It's not a la fufu. And I just have

1634
01:36:41,365 --> 01:36:44,325
Speaker 4:  been like, what the hell are these things?

1635
01:36:45,275 --> 01:36:48,525
Speaker 4:  What are these? So now we have a 3D printed laboo in our office.

1636
01:36:49,125 --> 01:36:51,445
Speaker 3:  I did see this and it was beautiful. It's gorgeous. It's

1637
01:36:51,525 --> 01:36:53,405
Speaker 4:  Gorgeous. It's gold. It's there,

1638
01:36:53,575 --> 01:36:53,925
Speaker 3:  We're

1639
01:36:53,925 --> 01:36:56,685
Speaker 7:  Not worshiping it. Just to be clear, we're not worshiping it. It's not our,

1640
01:36:56,685 --> 01:36:59,085
Speaker 7:  we're not worshiping it. We're not, it's not a new idol in the, on the office.

1641
01:36:59,085 --> 01:36:59,325
Speaker 7:  Yeah,

1642
01:36:59,325 --> 01:37:03,245
Speaker 3:  It's, but to be clear, we, we were jealous. And so yeah, we made a, we

1643
01:37:03,245 --> 01:37:05,765
Speaker 3:  made it, we knocked her off our own. We had to because

1644
01:37:06,045 --> 01:37:09,085
Speaker 4:  Mia did get a labu boo. I don't under, it's gonna take two months to get

1645
01:37:09,085 --> 01:37:09,485
Speaker 4:  the labu boo.

1646
01:37:09,565 --> 01:37:13,285
Speaker 3:  I do not understand fundamentally like, what is this mechanism to buy them?

1647
01:37:13,345 --> 01:37:15,285
Speaker 3:  Why do you have to keep tapping things? It's,

1648
01:37:15,435 --> 01:37:16,445
Speaker 4:  It's just distract. This

1649
01:37:16,445 --> 01:37:19,685
Speaker 3:  Seems like worse than buying concert tickets. It at like, at least with concert

1650
01:37:19,685 --> 01:37:23,485
Speaker 3:  tickets, you go in and you're like, I'm gonna find out instantly the bots

1651
01:37:23,485 --> 01:37:26,925
Speaker 3:  got them all. I'm gonna be upset. But like, at least, at least it will be

1652
01:37:26,925 --> 01:37:30,005
Speaker 3:  over quickly. And this seems like you spend like hours, like tapping your

1653
01:37:30,005 --> 01:37:30,525
Speaker 3:  phone screen.

1654
01:37:31,805 --> 01:37:35,765
Speaker 4:  I will not be, that's, that's a little much for me, but like, just as

1655
01:37:35,765 --> 01:37:39,685
Speaker 4:  like an observer of the human condition. The labu boo has

1656
01:37:39,685 --> 01:37:43,605
Speaker 4:  just been like a what the, wow. I went to a stray kids concert

1657
01:37:43,705 --> 01:37:47,565
Speaker 4:  in June and like my bias, which is like your favorite member. He was up there,

1658
01:37:47,925 --> 01:37:51,605
Speaker 4:  Felix and he had a blue laboo on him. I was like, he got, they got you too,

1659
01:37:52,895 --> 01:37:56,805
Speaker 4:  Felix. Oh. And I was like, I guess I gotta look up

1660
01:37:56,805 --> 01:37:58,205
Speaker 4:  what a lab boo boo is. For real.

1661
01:37:58,235 --> 01:38:01,165
Speaker 3:  Well you know who has a blue labu boo to flip? I

1662
01:38:01,285 --> 01:38:05,005
Speaker 4:  I Mia? Yeah. Mia has a blue lab booboo now. Yeah. Like I don't want

1663
01:38:05,365 --> 01:38:09,285
Speaker 4:  a Labu boo. My, my other, my, my bestie, her parents went to

1664
01:38:09,285 --> 01:38:12,805
Speaker 4:  the Louv in France and apparently they were selling a

1665
01:38:13,115 --> 01:38:16,005
Speaker 4:  full lab booboo as artist blind box set.

1666
01:38:16,065 --> 01:38:16,645
Speaker 7:  Oh my God.

1667
01:38:16,945 --> 01:38:20,645
Speaker 4:  And so it's like lab booboos in different, like a Van Go Lab. Oh my God.

1668
01:38:20,885 --> 01:38:24,645
Speaker 4:  A Starry Night Lab booboo. And she, I went over to her house and she just

1669
01:38:24,645 --> 01:38:28,285
Speaker 4:  had them all displayed. And I was like, when did you get into Lab Booboos?

1670
01:38:28,545 --> 01:38:31,845
Speaker 4:  And her parents were like, we had to get them 'cause they were at the Louvre.

1671
01:38:31,845 --> 01:38:34,685
Speaker 4:  And I was like, they have lab booboos at the Louvre.

1672
01:38:35,005 --> 01:38:38,245
Speaker 7:  I, I just wanna describe the, the, the ex I'm looking, I'm watching Mia's

1673
01:38:38,245 --> 01:38:42,205
Speaker 7:  video right now and what looks like a pentagram, like appears on

1674
01:38:42,205 --> 01:38:44,525
Speaker 7:  the screen and is like swirling. They

1675
01:38:44,555 --> 01:38:45,565
Speaker 4:  Have some in the Labu

1676
01:38:45,565 --> 01:38:48,365
Speaker 7:  Boo and now you've got these stores saying that they're not gonna sell them

1677
01:38:48,365 --> 01:38:50,885
Speaker 7:  because they think that they're Satanic la

1678
01:38:51,065 --> 01:38:51,285
Speaker 4:  Fu

1679
01:38:51,585 --> 01:38:52,285
Speaker 7:  That's the la

1680
01:38:53,005 --> 01:38:56,645
Speaker 4:  I don't know. This is, I it's also just really fun to say La Boo la Fufu

1681
01:38:56,945 --> 01:38:58,245
Speaker 4:  la Lavu.

1682
01:38:59,015 --> 01:39:02,325
Speaker 7:  We're like, we're like, I don't know, two weeks away from something like

1683
01:39:02,335 --> 01:39:06,285
Speaker 7:  truly horrific happening if this trend, either that or they're gonna be

1684
01:39:06,285 --> 01:39:08,685
Speaker 7:  like the hot new Halloween costume in October.

1685
01:39:09,805 --> 01:39:13,445
Speaker 4:  I mean, it's slightly better than the Sunny Angels, which are like the naked

1686
01:39:13,445 --> 01:39:16,685
Speaker 4:  babies that come with Cupid. Like Cuppy. May I,

1687
01:39:16,705 --> 01:39:20,565
Speaker 7:  I'm old enough to remember the, the Beanie Baby. Yes. Craze. My grandmother

1688
01:39:20,665 --> 01:39:24,245
Speaker 7:  got sucked into that. And when she passed away, we inherited her Beanie Baby

1689
01:39:24,245 --> 01:39:28,125
Speaker 7:  collection, which was literally a trunk full

1690
01:39:28,385 --> 01:39:28,765
Speaker 7:  of these.

1691
01:39:28,765 --> 01:39:32,045
Speaker 4:  That's what this is incredible. That's what it's lab Booboos are the la la

1692
01:39:32,065 --> 01:39:33,245
Speaker 4:  Beanie Babies of
