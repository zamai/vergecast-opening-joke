Description: If you’re heading on vacation this summer, you’re going to want to listen to this. The Verge’s Gaby del Valle joins the show to explain how worried you need to be about your digital data when you cross borders, and what you can do to protect yourself. Even if you don’t think you have anything to hide, a little precaution goes a long way. After that, Puck’s Matt Belloni joins the show to explain why Apple, Amazon, Google, and other tech companies continue to pour money into the streaming business, when it seems so far removed from what those companies do well. (Spoiler alert: it’s fun to be friends with Ben Stiller.) Finally, we answer a hotline question about the Google Pixel’s ascent to “best Android phone for people who just want a phone.” 

Oh, also: thanks to everyone who voted for us in the Webby Awards! We’ll know soon whether we won, but however it shakes out, we’re so grateful to everyone who voted for us.

00:00:03,305 --> 00:00:07,115
Speaker 2:  Welcome to The Vergecast, the flagship podcast of having really famous

3
00:00:07,115 --> 00:00:10,595
Speaker 2:  friends. I'm your friend, David Pierce, and I am in my backyard

4
00:00:10,975 --> 00:00:14,475
Speaker 2:  on my patio, putting together this little tykes house

5
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:18,595
Speaker 2:  that we got from my toddler. It was a gift from my parents. My

6
00:00:18,695 --> 00:00:21,915
Speaker 2:  2-year-old I think is very much gonna like it, but also, if I'm being honest,

7
00:00:22,335 --> 00:00:25,155
Speaker 2:  it was very fun and cathartic to put this thing together in the way that

8
00:00:25,155 --> 00:00:28,715
Speaker 2:  it's fun to like do Ikea furniture. It's a little bit of work. It's just

9
00:00:28,715 --> 00:00:31,795
Speaker 2:  enough to make you feel like you've really accomplished something. And I'm

10
00:00:31,795 --> 00:00:35,155
Speaker 2:  like, yeah, I built a house today. Is it made of plastic? And will it blow

11
00:00:35,155 --> 00:00:38,955
Speaker 2:  away next time there's wind? Yes, but that's not important. I built a house

12
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:42,675
Speaker 2:  today Anyway, this house is not what we are here to talk about today.

13
00:00:42,725 --> 00:00:46,275
Speaker 2:  Today on the show, we're gonna do two things. First, I'm gonna talk to Gabby

14
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:50,155
Speaker 2:  del Va about a thing we've actually heard from you a lot about recently,

15
00:00:50,155 --> 00:00:53,755
Speaker 2:  which is how to travel with your phone, especially across

16
00:00:53,755 --> 00:00:56,835
Speaker 2:  borders right now. It's very complicated in the United States politically.

17
00:00:57,255 --> 00:01:00,915
Speaker 2:  And so Gabby and I are gonna try to give you some tips on what to do to

18
00:01:00,915 --> 00:01:04,875
Speaker 2:  secure your data before you travel. Then I'm gonna talk to Matt Bella From

19
00:01:04,945 --> 00:01:08,395
Speaker 2:  Puck about what he's seeing in the big tech

20
00:01:08,395 --> 00:01:11,675
Speaker 2:  streaming wars and why companies like Apple and Amazon and Google

21
00:01:12,145 --> 00:01:16,035
Speaker 2:  want in on this in the first place. We also have a really fun hotline question

22
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:19,875
Speaker 2:  about Google. Lots to get to today, but first I have to figure out

23
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:23,755
Speaker 2:  how to get out of this house. I barely crammed myself in here and it's gonna

24
00:01:23,755 --> 00:01:27,275
Speaker 2:  be very ugly getting out. So this is The Vergecast. We'll be right back.

25
00:02:59,385 --> 00:03:03,195
Speaker 2:  Welcome back. All right, the house is finished. I get to get rid of this

26
00:03:03,195 --> 00:03:06,955
Speaker 2:  giant box behind me. I made it out alive. Life is good. Let's get

27
00:03:06,955 --> 00:03:10,795
Speaker 2:  into it. We've heard from a bunch of you over the last few months with

28
00:03:10,795 --> 00:03:14,675
Speaker 2:  kind of a similar question, which is basically some version of, I'm about

29
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:18,595
Speaker 2:  to travel and I don't know what to do with my devices.

30
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:22,195
Speaker 2:  I think for a lot of political reasons, especially here in the United States,

31
00:03:22,725 --> 00:03:26,675
Speaker 2:  there are new questions about how you should be securing your phone

32
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:30,715
Speaker 2:  and what data you should be traveling with across borders. It just feels

33
00:03:30,715 --> 00:03:33,875
Speaker 2:  different now and I actually think this is the kind of thing that has been

34
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:38,315
Speaker 2:  interesting and important for a long time, but is really just coming to the

35
00:03:38,315 --> 00:03:42,275
Speaker 2:  forefront now in a new way. So I grabbed Gabby DelVal who wrote a really

36
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:46,115
Speaker 2:  great story for us about this and we dug into it. Let's do it.

37
00:03:46,505 --> 00:03:48,055
Speaker 2:  Gabby DelVal is here. Hi Gabby.

38
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:49,495
Speaker 6:  Hi. How's it going?

39
00:03:49,555 --> 00:03:52,975
Speaker 2:  You're, you're here Out of the trenches of the insanity of our

40
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:56,375
Speaker 2:  world right now. I feel like every time you turn in a story, it's just like

41
00:03:56,375 --> 00:04:00,215
Speaker 2:  the world is weirder than you even think or realize by Gabby. Yeah,

42
00:04:00,675 --> 00:04:04,615
Speaker 6:  That's kind of my beat. It sucks. I,

43
00:04:04,735 --> 00:04:07,975
Speaker 6:  I mean, I like it. I like doing it, but I'm like, what if things weren't

44
00:04:08,045 --> 00:04:09,695
Speaker 6:  that way? That would be awesome.

45
00:04:10,645 --> 00:04:14,295
Speaker 2:  Yeah, indeed. So I've, I've asked you to do this because you

46
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:18,255
Speaker 2:  wrote a story about basically traveling to the United States with

47
00:04:18,255 --> 00:04:22,175
Speaker 2:  your phone in 2025 and we also got a hotline question

48
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:25,655
Speaker 2:  very specifically asking about the same thing. Your story did super well.

49
00:04:25,655 --> 00:04:29,415
Speaker 2:  This is clearly a thing people are curious about and I just wanted to dig

50
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:32,255
Speaker 2:  into some of it. But let me, let me just play you the question that we got

51
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:35,095
Speaker 2:  on The Vergecast hotline as a way to just kind of set up the conversation

52
00:04:35,095 --> 00:04:37,575
Speaker 2:  we're about to have. Does that sound good? Yeah. Alright. Lemme just play

53
00:04:37,575 --> 00:04:37,735
Speaker 2:  this.

54
00:04:39,115 --> 00:04:43,055
Speaker 7:  Hey David, I'm European and I'm about to travel to the us. I read about customs

55
00:04:43,055 --> 00:04:46,295
Speaker 7:  and Border Patrol searching phones. What might happen if I refuse and if

56
00:04:46,295 --> 00:04:49,975
Speaker 7:  I have to let them search my phone, how do I prepare? Do they delete chat

57
00:04:50,055 --> 00:04:53,735
Speaker 7:  apps and password managers? Do I log out of my Google account and

58
00:04:53,735 --> 00:04:57,175
Speaker 7:  delete my Google drive? Do I change my phone password? And what about my

59
00:04:57,175 --> 00:04:57,575
Speaker 7:  laptop?

60
00:04:58,805 --> 00:05:02,655
Speaker 2:  Okay, so there are a bunch of good practical questions in here, but be before

61
00:05:02,655 --> 00:05:06,335
Speaker 2:  we get to all the good practical questions, I just wanna sort of lay the

62
00:05:06,335 --> 00:05:10,095
Speaker 2:  land a little bit on this. And one thing I've been wondering a lot is how

63
00:05:10,945 --> 00:05:14,935
Speaker 2:  widespread is this kind of border search right

64
00:05:14,935 --> 00:05:18,415
Speaker 2:  now? The idea that like somebody will detain you and search through your

65
00:05:18,415 --> 00:05:21,455
Speaker 2:  phone and look for anti-Trump text messages is like a thing we're hearing

66
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:25,295
Speaker 2:  about how big and widespread is this right now? Really,

67
00:05:26,055 --> 00:05:29,695
Speaker 6:  I would say it's not super widespread, at least according to the most recent

68
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:33,655
Speaker 6:  data we have, which is from the 2024 fiscal year. So it's not current,

69
00:05:33,915 --> 00:05:37,695
Speaker 6:  but that year less than 0.01%

70
00:05:37,835 --> 00:05:41,055
Speaker 6:  of arriving international travelers had their devices searched by customs

71
00:05:41,055 --> 00:05:44,415
Speaker 6:  and border protection. But at the same time, we are seeing, you know, a lot

72
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:47,415
Speaker 6:  of anecdotal reports of people having their phone searched, are people having

73
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:50,375
Speaker 6:  their laptop searched of being turned away because of what comes up in a

74
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,655
Speaker 6:  search. So I would say even though it's not

75
00:05:53,685 --> 00:05:57,135
Speaker 6:  necessarily something that happens really frequently, like people's

76
00:05:58,315 --> 00:06:01,565
Speaker 6:  anxieties are not entirely misplaced either because you don't know if it's

77
00:06:01,565 --> 00:06:02,805
Speaker 6:  gonna happen to you ultimately.

78
00:06:02,815 --> 00:06:05,765
Speaker 2:  Right. And it, it does seem like it'll probably be a minute before we get

79
00:06:06,235 --> 00:06:10,045
Speaker 2:  real quantitative data about this stuff, but it certainly

80
00:06:10,045 --> 00:06:14,005
Speaker 2:  seems like anecdotally the, the stories we're hearing about this seem

81
00:06:14,005 --> 00:06:15,925
Speaker 2:  to have increased pretty dramatically.

82
00:06:16,435 --> 00:06:20,005
Speaker 6:  Yeah, I would say anecdotally they've increased. And I mean, you know, part

83
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:23,525
Speaker 6:  of that could be like whenever Trump is in office, like people care more

84
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:27,005
Speaker 6:  about what customs and border protection is doing, what ICE is doing. It's

85
00:06:27,005 --> 00:06:30,245
Speaker 6:  just kind of a, like an attention effect. But at the same time, like the

86
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:34,205
Speaker 6:  reasons why people are being turned away are in some cases

87
00:06:34,205 --> 00:06:37,925
Speaker 6:  unusual. Like a French scientist who sent like text messages saying that

88
00:06:38,115 --> 00:06:39,645
Speaker 6:  Trump's research cuts were bad.

89
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:44,965
Speaker 6:  Like that's not a, a usual reason to turn someone away or

90
00:06:44,995 --> 00:06:45,765
Speaker 6:  deny them entry.

91
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:49,965
Speaker 2:  So how did it come to pass that these are legal searches that

92
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:53,085
Speaker 2:  customs and border protection is actually doing? What is the legality of

93
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:53,805
Speaker 2:  these searches right now?

94
00:06:54,545 --> 00:06:58,245
Speaker 6:  So in 2014 the Supreme Court ruled that law enforcement cannot

95
00:06:58,245 --> 00:07:01,045
Speaker 6:  conduct warrantless searches of people's cell phones without their consent.

96
00:07:01,665 --> 00:07:05,485
Speaker 6:  But there is what is called the border zone or border search

97
00:07:05,485 --> 00:07:09,325
Speaker 6:  exemption, which is exactly what allows CBP to search your phone

98
00:07:09,545 --> 00:07:13,245
Speaker 6:  at an airport or other port of entry. So in this instance, border doesn't

99
00:07:13,245 --> 00:07:16,725
Speaker 6:  mean like the physical, like land borders of the us Like you're, if you're

100
00:07:16,725 --> 00:07:20,405
Speaker 6:  flying into Chicago on an international flight, like that's a border

101
00:07:20,475 --> 00:07:24,045
Speaker 6:  zone. If you're flying into like, I don't know Omaha, I'm just picking places

102
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:26,085
Speaker 6:  in the middle of the country, like you don't have to be physically at the

103
00:07:26,085 --> 00:07:29,405
Speaker 6:  border for you to be in like a border zone.

104
00:07:30,105 --> 00:07:33,885
Speaker 6:  So the border zone exemption basically means that there are just like

105
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:38,575
Speaker 6:  areas where the fourth Amendment, not that it doesn't exist, but

106
00:07:38,685 --> 00:07:42,095
Speaker 6:  it's a little bit more flexible, a little bit less robust

107
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:46,135
Speaker 6:  because you're being inspected for entry into the country. So even though

108
00:07:46,135 --> 00:07:49,415
Speaker 6:  you are physically present in the United States, you have not yet been legally

109
00:07:49,815 --> 00:07:52,295
Speaker 6:  admitted. So it's, it's just like a kind of different,

110
00:07:53,325 --> 00:07:54,455
Speaker 6:  different situation.

111
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:59,005
Speaker 2:  So, and and is the idea that just by virtue of the fact that

112
00:07:59,005 --> 00:08:02,325
Speaker 2:  you are coming from not in the United States to in the United States, that

113
00:08:02,325 --> 00:08:06,305
Speaker 2:  somehow there is, I don't know, like probable

114
00:08:06,305 --> 00:08:09,705
Speaker 2:  cause or a reason to check or like I, I guess what is the reason behind that

115
00:08:09,705 --> 00:08:10,105
Speaker 2:  exemption?

116
00:08:10,645 --> 00:08:14,185
Speaker 6:  So I spoke to a lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who explained

117
00:08:14,185 --> 00:08:17,305
Speaker 6:  it to me, basically is like, you know, there's always kind of been a border

118
00:08:17,305 --> 00:08:20,545
Speaker 6:  exemption and it's, before there were phones it was, they would check your

119
00:08:20,545 --> 00:08:23,385
Speaker 6:  luggage, they would check the things on your person, things that similarly

120
00:08:24,015 --> 00:08:27,905
Speaker 6:  like what you would need, like reasonable, reasonable

121
00:08:28,105 --> 00:08:31,345
Speaker 6:  suspicion or whatever for search and seizure. But because you are entering,

122
00:08:31,435 --> 00:08:34,865
Speaker 6:  these things are considered like related to your travel, related to your

123
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:38,745
Speaker 6:  reason for being in the country. But your luggage, you know, they might be

124
00:08:38,745 --> 00:08:41,425
Speaker 6:  looking for you smuggling something, trafficking something,

125
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:46,385
Speaker 6:  drugs, people contraband eggs.

126
00:08:46,785 --> 00:08:50,385
Speaker 6:  Recently CBP has had an increase in people

127
00:08:50,585 --> 00:08:54,425
Speaker 6:  smuggling eggs from Mexico, which is really funny. Oh boy.

128
00:08:55,475 --> 00:08:59,245
Speaker 6:  Yeah. But your phone is not really

129
00:08:59,315 --> 00:09:03,165
Speaker 6:  like just a thing that you're carrying with you or your laptop.

130
00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:07,245
Speaker 6:  It like contains your entire life on it. Which is why like

131
00:09:07,725 --> 00:09:10,405
Speaker 6:  domestically, the Supreme Court has held that, you know,

132
00:09:11,505 --> 00:09:14,605
Speaker 6:  law enforcement can't just go through your phone without a warrant, but

133
00:09:15,475 --> 00:09:18,845
Speaker 6:  it's because of this border search exemption. They can do it at ports of

134
00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:19,125
Speaker 6:  entry.

135
00:09:19,895 --> 00:09:23,085
Speaker 2:  Right. It's exactly the thing you just said about your phone is both the

136
00:09:23,085 --> 00:09:26,885
Speaker 2:  reason it should be more protected and the reason customs

137
00:09:26,885 --> 00:09:29,645
Speaker 2:  border protection would really, really, really like to look at like Exactly

138
00:09:29,655 --> 00:09:33,645
Speaker 2:  those two things are exactly in like diametric opposition at all times.

139
00:09:34,195 --> 00:09:34,685
Speaker 6:  Exactly.

140
00:09:35,195 --> 00:09:38,805
Speaker 2:  Okay. So what do we know about how these searches actually work?

141
00:09:38,915 --> 00:09:42,725
Speaker 2:  Like I'm, I'm imagining just like a, a dude

142
00:09:43,005 --> 00:09:45,365
Speaker 2:  standing in the corner, just like flipping through the apps on your phone.

143
00:09:45,435 --> 00:09:47,285
Speaker 2:  What, what actually happens in one of these searches?

144
00:09:47,665 --> 00:09:51,245
Speaker 6:  So it depends. I would say, you know when you get to the airport and you

145
00:09:51,265 --> 00:09:54,645
Speaker 6:  go through customs and they're like, where were you? What's the reason for

146
00:09:54,645 --> 00:09:58,605
Speaker 6:  your travel? That's just like your standard run of the mill inspection.

147
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:02,565
Speaker 6:  You can get pulled into what's known as a secondary inspection, which is

148
00:10:02,565 --> 00:10:05,445
Speaker 6:  when they take you into a back room and this is like they ask you more questions,

149
00:10:05,865 --> 00:10:09,685
Speaker 6:  you're sitting in the room and so they can also look at your phone

150
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:13,165
Speaker 6:  If you say yes, there's two types of searches they can do. There's what's

151
00:10:13,165 --> 00:10:15,805
Speaker 6:  known as a basic search. They have to put your phone on airplane mode and

152
00:10:15,805 --> 00:10:18,325
Speaker 6:  they can look at whatever is on your phone on airplane mode. They can use

153
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:20,365
Speaker 6:  the search function on your phone. They can go through your pictures, they

154
00:10:20,365 --> 00:10:24,045
Speaker 6:  can go through your texts, like any apps that you have open that like maybe

155
00:10:24,045 --> 00:10:26,765
Speaker 6:  are still cache, like they can look through all of that with your phone on

156
00:10:26,925 --> 00:10:30,525
Speaker 6:  airplane mode. Then there's what's known as advanced or forensic

157
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:33,725
Speaker 6:  search, which is when they hook your phone up to an external device and they

158
00:10:33,725 --> 00:10:37,525
Speaker 6:  like grab everything that's on it and they keep it. Okay.

159
00:10:37,525 --> 00:10:41,245
Speaker 6:  They keep it for as long as they want. And in

160
00:10:41,245 --> 00:10:44,845
Speaker 6:  some jurisdictions, like they can only do warrantless

161
00:10:45,485 --> 00:10:49,205
Speaker 6:  forensic searches that are pursuant to like border

162
00:10:49,225 --> 00:10:52,485
Speaker 6:  crimes and some jurisdictions they can only do searches that are pursuant

163
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:56,365
Speaker 6:  to other types of crimes. It depends, but mostly they can

164
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:59,965
Speaker 6:  just look at your phone and take what's on it and they just store that information

165
00:10:59,965 --> 00:11:03,725
Speaker 6:  forever. Or maybe not forever, but for a very long time. I need to check

166
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:04,925
Speaker 6:  the, the laws on that.

167
00:11:05,395 --> 00:11:09,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah. But even in the basic search to your point, like I, I think it's, it

168
00:11:09,365 --> 00:11:13,205
Speaker 2:  strikes me as I, I think one of the questions a lot of people are

169
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:16,565
Speaker 2:  going to have, like our, our caller here is like, okay, what, what information

170
00:11:16,585 --> 00:11:20,365
Speaker 2:  are they looking for? And I think to the question of like, okay, you're gonna

171
00:11:20,435 --> 00:11:24,285
Speaker 2:  dump everything on my device and take it. I think that's one

172
00:11:24,445 --> 00:11:26,485
Speaker 2:  question, but like, okay, I'm sitting in the room and there's somebody flipping

173
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:30,045
Speaker 2:  through my phone. Are they just like doing a spotlight search for the word

174
00:11:30,255 --> 00:11:33,565
Speaker 2:  Trump and seeing what happened? Like is that, is that a reasonable guess

175
00:11:33,585 --> 00:11:34,565
Speaker 2:  as to what's going on here?

176
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:38,355
Speaker 6:  I dunno if I could speak to that just 'cause I, I don't know. Okay. Like

177
00:11:38,355 --> 00:11:41,915
Speaker 6:  it'd be looking for anything like, it's kind of like the inverse

178
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:45,075
Speaker 6:  of well If you have nothing to hide, like what are you afraid of? It's like

179
00:11:45,075 --> 00:11:47,395
Speaker 6:  you on there used against

180
00:11:48,905 --> 00:11:52,115
Speaker 6:  texting his friend. Like it's so crazy that Trump

181
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,405
Speaker 6:  funding funding being a reason to deny them entry from the country is like

182
00:11:56,915 --> 00:12:00,445
Speaker 6:  wild. Right. There is, there was a story of a

183
00:12:00,935 --> 00:12:04,805
Speaker 6:  brown university doctor who had her visa rescinded and

184
00:12:04,805 --> 00:12:08,725
Speaker 6:  got turned away. The CBP agents who were interrogating her say that she

185
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:12,765
Speaker 6:  had admitted to going to Lebanon where she is from to attend

186
00:12:12,905 --> 00:12:16,765
Speaker 6:  the former leader of Hezbollah's funeral. Which

187
00:12:16,765 --> 00:12:20,085
Speaker 6:  like in most instances that would, that would get you turned away.

188
00:12:20,545 --> 00:12:23,925
Speaker 6:  But they apparently searched her phone and found

189
00:12:24,825 --> 00:12:28,565
Speaker 6:  photos they called sympathetic photos and images of

190
00:12:29,065 --> 00:12:32,485
Speaker 6:  the former leader of Hezbollah in her phone's recently deleted folder. So

191
00:12:32,505 --> 00:12:36,085
Speaker 6:  not even like in her camera roll, but in the recently deleted folder.

192
00:12:37,505 --> 00:12:39,965
Speaker 6:  And when they asked her like, why do you have these pictures on your phone

193
00:12:40,265 --> 00:12:43,405
Speaker 6:  and why did you delete them? She was like, oh, my family sends them on WhatsApp

194
00:12:43,945 --> 00:12:47,845
Speaker 6:  and I deleted them. 'cause like I, I don't know, like they're not me,

195
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:51,445
Speaker 6:  but like yeah I support some of his like religious tea. Like whatever she,

196
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:55,355
Speaker 6:  she said a lot of stuff. But the point being like If you read

197
00:12:55,355 --> 00:12:59,315
Speaker 6:  between the lines there like WhatsApp defaults to downloading

198
00:12:59,515 --> 00:13:02,395
Speaker 6:  whatever images people send you. Yeah. So yeah, like yeah, like my family

199
00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:05,795
Speaker 6:  sends like a zillion like good morning everyone things and I have to delete

200
00:13:05,795 --> 00:13:09,755
Speaker 6:  those on WhatsApp like every single day. Yep. All it was just

201
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:13,315
Speaker 6:  to say you don't know what they're gonna find in your phone and even like

202
00:13:13,315 --> 00:13:16,795
Speaker 6:  trying to delete stuff might not necessarily help you

203
00:13:17,535 --> 00:13:20,315
Speaker 6:  If you don't fully delete it and then they find it in your recently deleted

204
00:13:20,315 --> 00:13:20,995
Speaker 6:  folder. Right.

205
00:13:21,755 --> 00:13:24,235
Speaker 2:  Interesting. Yeah, I was just thinking like we're, we're in the middle of,

206
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:28,235
Speaker 2:  you know, litigating like the, the signal group chat for attack planning

207
00:13:28,235 --> 00:13:31,155
Speaker 2:  and all this stuff and it's like there's actually a lot of ways that things

208
00:13:31,215 --> 00:13:34,795
Speaker 2:  can happen on your phone without you even necessarily

209
00:13:34,885 --> 00:13:38,195
Speaker 2:  being actively engaged in it. Like I was actually thinking about the WhatsApp

210
00:13:38,195 --> 00:13:41,675
Speaker 2:  one where like mine is all, all my friends are like degenerate sports gamblers.

211
00:13:41,935 --> 00:13:45,235
Speaker 2:  So there's now my camera role looks like I'm a degenerate sports gambler

212
00:13:45,235 --> 00:13:48,595
Speaker 2:  even though it's just all of my degenerate friends sending the bets that

213
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:51,875
Speaker 2:  they're losing that just dump into my camera roll now. And so I'm like, If

214
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,395
Speaker 2:  you just opened up my phone, you would actually make a bunch of assumptions

215
00:13:54,395 --> 00:13:58,355
Speaker 2:  about me that are wrong. Totally. And that is just one specific tiny

216
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,035
Speaker 2:  way that that stuff can actually start to happen.

217
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,955
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Your friends are the ones whose parlays are hitting. It's not you,

218
00:14:04,055 --> 00:14:04,915
Speaker 6:  It is your friends.

219
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:07,475
Speaker 2:  All my parlays hit Gabby. Yeah. Let's

220
00:14:07,475 --> 00:14:11,195
Speaker 6:  Be clear. That's right, that's right. But yeah, like, I

221
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:14,595
Speaker 6:  dunno, like I have texts on my phone from like 12 years ago, I don't know

222
00:14:14,595 --> 00:14:18,155
Speaker 6:  what I was saying 12 years ago. Totally. Like I just, I don't think about

223
00:14:18,155 --> 00:14:21,955
Speaker 6:  it and you know, maybe, maybe we should be thinking about it,

224
00:14:21,965 --> 00:14:25,675
Speaker 6:  which is, which is concerning. And it applies both to

225
00:14:25,905 --> 00:14:29,475
Speaker 6:  like people traveling to the US from outside the country on visas. And to

226
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:32,915
Speaker 6:  us citizens, the difference is just like what your rights are, what your

227
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:35,675
Speaker 6:  abil, whether you have the ability to say no and what happens If you say

228
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:35,835
Speaker 6:  no.

229
00:14:36,385 --> 00:14:38,475
Speaker 2:  Yeah, let's talk about that actually. 'cause I I was gonna ask you about

230
00:14:38,475 --> 00:14:41,715
Speaker 2:  this 'cause you said If you say yes, these are the two kinds of searches

231
00:14:41,745 --> 00:14:45,595
Speaker 2:  that they can do, can you say no? Who can say no?

232
00:14:46,065 --> 00:14:47,195
Speaker 2:  What happens If you say no?

233
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:51,035
Speaker 6:  Technically anyone can say no, but different things will happen if you're

234
00:14:51,165 --> 00:14:54,485
Speaker 6:  a US citizen and then you and you say no, they can't deny you entry into

235
00:14:54,485 --> 00:14:57,085
Speaker 6:  the country because you are a US citizen. They might hold you in there for

236
00:14:57,085 --> 00:15:00,055
Speaker 6:  a while. They might try to be like, why are you saying no?

237
00:15:01,195 --> 00:15:04,735
Speaker 6:  But they can't not let you in. They can take your phone

238
00:15:05,275 --> 00:15:09,255
Speaker 6:  and they can use forensics tools to get into

239
00:15:09,255 --> 00:15:13,215
Speaker 6:  your phone if they really want to. This has happened before. There's case

240
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:13,855
Speaker 6:  law about it.

241
00:15:15,435 --> 00:15:18,975
Speaker 6:  If you're a permanent resident so you have a green card, it's tricky. Like

242
00:15:19,075 --> 00:15:23,015
Speaker 6:  you can say no and in some cases you can't be denied entry into the country.

243
00:15:23,195 --> 00:15:26,815
Speaker 6:  But like If you've been outta the country for more than six months, then

244
00:15:26,815 --> 00:15:30,095
Speaker 6:  you are basically like once again being inspected for entry.

245
00:15:31,075 --> 00:15:34,855
Speaker 6:  And so saying no could like affect your inspection for entry If you have

246
00:15:34,855 --> 00:15:38,735
Speaker 6:  like certain charges on your record. Like that could lead to you also

247
00:15:38,735 --> 00:15:42,455
Speaker 6:  kind of being inspected again. So it's just a little bit

248
00:15:42,455 --> 00:15:46,375
Speaker 6:  trickier than It is for you as citizens. If you have a visa and you say

249
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:49,815
Speaker 6:  no, they can just fully not let you in. They can send you back to

250
00:15:50,415 --> 00:15:53,495
Speaker 6:  wherever you came from and they can deny you entry.

251
00:15:54,335 --> 00:15:57,735
Speaker 6:  So the safer thing to do than saying no

252
00:15:58,195 --> 00:16:02,135
Speaker 6:  is to, you know, travel with your devices really locked

253
00:16:02,135 --> 00:16:03,655
Speaker 6:  down and really clean.

254
00:16:04,555 --> 00:16:07,685
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Okay. So this, this is a good segue to like, let's get, let's get super

255
00:16:07,685 --> 00:16:11,605
Speaker 2:  practical about this here. The, the sort of nuclear option here

256
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:14,485
Speaker 2:  is just like factory reset your phone before you get on the plane. Is that,

257
00:16:14,505 --> 00:16:16,485
Speaker 2:  is that just the idea here? Is that what you should do?

258
00:16:17,365 --> 00:16:21,245
Speaker 6:  I mean, it's not a bad idea. I would say it's not, it's not a bad idea back,

259
00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:25,205
Speaker 6:  like upload whatever back at all up factory reset.

260
00:16:25,705 --> 00:16:29,005
Speaker 6:  If you don't want a factory reset, there are like other things that you could

261
00:16:29,005 --> 00:16:32,565
Speaker 6:  do. And I would say this advice applies most to us

262
00:16:32,845 --> 00:16:36,725
Speaker 6:  citizens and permanent residents. If you have a visa, I'm, I'm not

263
00:16:36,725 --> 00:16:40,525
Speaker 6:  really sure like whether, you know, just like targeted

264
00:16:40,525 --> 00:16:43,165
Speaker 6:  deleting of stuff is gonna is gonna help you much. But

265
00:16:45,165 --> 00:16:48,745
Speaker 6:  If you don't want a factory reset your phone,

266
00:16:49,285 --> 00:16:52,505
Speaker 6:  you should, I mean actually everyone, everyone should turn off biometric,

267
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:55,825
Speaker 6:  fingerprint face. Id turn it off. Turn it off. Yeah.

268
00:16:55,825 --> 00:16:57,465
Speaker 2:  Wait, can you explain that to me actually? 'cause that was one thing in your

269
00:16:57,465 --> 00:17:01,105
Speaker 2:  reporting that that I, I found sort of confusing and surprising that

270
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:05,185
Speaker 2:  there is a difference between what they can do with your face

271
00:17:05,285 --> 00:17:08,625
Speaker 2:  ID or touch ID and what they can do with your like six digit passcode to

272
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:09,905
Speaker 2:  get into your phone. What is going on there?

273
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:14,265
Speaker 6:  Yeah, so this is like a very interesting legal thing. It's the difference

274
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:17,145
Speaker 6:  between what's known as testimonial and non testimonial

275
00:17:17,815 --> 00:17:21,745
Speaker 6:  testimonial and non testimonial evidence. I believe, and

276
00:17:21,745 --> 00:17:25,025
Speaker 6:  this has mostly been litigated in like

277
00:17:25,475 --> 00:17:29,305
Speaker 6:  local police departments unlocking people's phones with their fingerprint

278
00:17:29,305 --> 00:17:33,145
Speaker 6:  or their face. But like some courts have ruled that a cop

279
00:17:33,145 --> 00:17:36,665
Speaker 6:  cannot compel you to give them your phone password, like

280
00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:41,305
Speaker 6:  one, two, three, four, they cannot ask you or whatever It is, but they

281
00:17:41,445 --> 00:17:44,785
Speaker 6:  can use your finger or your face because

282
00:17:45,295 --> 00:17:49,125
Speaker 6:  basically testimonial evidence is evidence that compels you to, to

283
00:17:49,925 --> 00:17:53,845
Speaker 6:  disclose the, the contents of your mind or your thoughts. So you are by

284
00:17:53,845 --> 00:17:57,005
Speaker 6:  telling them your password, you are disclosing something that you think you

285
00:17:57,005 --> 00:18:00,895
Speaker 6:  are being compelled to tell 'em what you think. Interesting. But that doesn't

286
00:18:00,895 --> 00:18:04,195
Speaker 6:  happen when they're just like putting your finger on the thing. This is also

287
00:18:04,195 --> 00:18:07,555
Speaker 6:  like when people go to protest, they're advised to, you know, turn off like

288
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,355
Speaker 6:  biometrics because they can take your phone and just like kind of,

289
00:18:10,615 --> 00:18:14,515
Speaker 2:  So just yeah, like the, the only analogy I can draw there is like, that's,

290
00:18:14,515 --> 00:18:18,395
Speaker 2:  that's the law you make so that they can fingerprint you at the police

291
00:18:18,395 --> 00:18:21,555
Speaker 2:  station and but you still don't have to talk. Like is that,

292
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,395
Speaker 2:  is there some similar there?

293
00:18:23,665 --> 00:18:26,435
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know if like that's like the legal like reason

294
00:18:26,465 --> 00:18:29,515
Speaker 6:  that is like a, like an analogy that like makes sense to me. Okay. There

295
00:18:29,535 --> 00:18:33,395
Speaker 6:  is, so one federal appeals court ruled that

296
00:18:33,775 --> 00:18:37,515
Speaker 6:  non testimonial evidence, so like a biometric login for your phone

297
00:18:37,955 --> 00:18:41,555
Speaker 6:  requires no cognitive exertion placing it firmly in the same

298
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:45,355
Speaker 6:  category as a blood draw or fingerprint taken at booking. Yeah. So you're

299
00:18:45,355 --> 00:18:48,395
Speaker 6:  totally right. Oh, there you go. Okay. Yeah. So because it doesn't require

300
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:52,315
Speaker 6:  you to think or express your thoughts against your will, then

301
00:18:52,425 --> 00:18:53,435
Speaker 6:  they're allowed to do it.

302
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:57,975
Speaker 2:  Okay. I'm not sure I buy that distinction, but It is, It is an interesting

303
00:18:57,975 --> 00:19:01,815
Speaker 2:  distinction nonetheless. Okay. So the the practical advice there is turn

304
00:19:01,815 --> 00:19:05,535
Speaker 2:  off everything but the passcode. Yeah, for sure. Turn off all biometric

305
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:06,575
Speaker 2:  authentication

306
00:19:06,755 --> 00:19:10,375
Speaker 6:  And turn off your phone before you cross. Why? Because

307
00:19:10,595 --> 00:19:14,095
Speaker 6:  the first time you turn your phone back on, you can't log in with biometrics.

308
00:19:14,095 --> 00:19:17,415
Speaker 6:  So even If you forget to turn off biometrics, like the first time you need

309
00:19:17,415 --> 00:19:20,775
Speaker 6:  to put in your passcode, there are, depending on like on your device,

310
00:19:21,295 --> 00:19:24,535
Speaker 6:  you can maybe disable biometrics by like pressing the button on the side

311
00:19:24,575 --> 00:19:28,015
Speaker 6:  a couple times. So like, yeah, the main thing is no

312
00:19:28,215 --> 00:19:31,455
Speaker 6:  biometrics, passcode, login only turn your phone off

313
00:19:32,115 --> 00:19:35,975
Speaker 6:  so you know, back up your device wipe whatever you wanna

314
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:39,095
Speaker 6:  wipe. And again, like people are gonna say like, why do I have to wipe my

315
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:42,795
Speaker 6:  device if I'm not doing anything wrong? It's like, because

316
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:46,595
Speaker 6:  the scope of what is wrong is expanding and expanding and expanding

317
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:48,795
Speaker 6:  even if the law hasn't changed.

318
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:52,035
Speaker 2:  Yeah. And, and truthfully like the, the way I would answer that question

319
00:19:52,035 --> 00:19:55,955
Speaker 2:  is like maybe you don't, but is it worth the risk? Right? Like

320
00:19:56,145 --> 00:19:58,795
Speaker 2:  Even if you don't think there is something in there, like I think about this,

321
00:19:58,795 --> 00:20:01,915
Speaker 2:  like you were saying, your text messages from 12 years ago, like this is

322
00:20:01,915 --> 00:20:04,595
Speaker 2:  the reason I, I like deleted all my tweets at one point I was just like,

323
00:20:04,635 --> 00:20:08,195
Speaker 2:  I, I don't know what I was tweeting in 2010, but I absolutely do not wanna

324
00:20:08,195 --> 00:20:11,155
Speaker 2:  be held responsible for it. Right? Like no one should be held responsible

325
00:20:11,155 --> 00:20:14,515
Speaker 2:  for what they were saying on the internet or in text messages 15 years ago.

326
00:20:14,895 --> 00:20:18,395
Speaker 2:  And in this particular case you are potentially signing yourself up for

327
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:22,595
Speaker 2:  if nothing else that and that Totally, that should scare

328
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:23,635
Speaker 2:  everyone. Like,

329
00:20:24,095 --> 00:20:27,675
Speaker 6:  And if they do a forensic search of your phone, they keep, they keep the

330
00:20:27,675 --> 00:20:30,995
Speaker 6:  data like they keep it, it's theirs. So

331
00:20:31,535 --> 00:20:34,275
Speaker 6:  DHS is building out this massive surveillance database called heart, which

332
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:37,515
Speaker 6:  stands for the Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology.

333
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:42,235
Speaker 6:  And it's gonna basically replace their current massive database,

334
00:20:42,235 --> 00:20:45,915
Speaker 6:  which is called the Automated Biometric Identification system

335
00:20:46,055 --> 00:20:50,005
Speaker 6:  or I ident and heart is like their plan

336
00:20:50,005 --> 00:20:53,965
Speaker 6:  is to be able to map people's like non-obvious relationships, like all of

337
00:20:53,965 --> 00:20:56,645
Speaker 6:  these different things about a person's life that again, like go beyond like

338
00:20:57,025 --> 00:20:59,765
Speaker 6:  who, like why are you traveling to the us where are you coming from? Like

339
00:20:59,765 --> 00:21:03,635
Speaker 6:  what do you have on you? Like If you let them, you know,

340
00:21:03,635 --> 00:21:07,235
Speaker 6:  take your phone and take all the contents on your own and back it up for

341
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:11,315
Speaker 6:  God knows how long, like that is data that that is being fed into this like

342
00:21:11,315 --> 00:21:15,195
Speaker 6:  massive machine and you dunno how it's gonna be weaponized against you or

343
00:21:15,195 --> 00:21:18,595
Speaker 6:  other people. It's kind of like the 23 and me thing, you know, like you get

344
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:21,515
Speaker 6:  a Christmas present, you spit into a vial and like suddenly like you're like

345
00:21:21,515 --> 00:21:25,315
Speaker 6:  12th cousin is getting arrested for like murder maybe.

346
00:21:25,745 --> 00:21:28,715
Speaker 6:  Yeah. Just weird analogy I guess. But

347
00:21:29,035 --> 00:21:31,955
Speaker 2:  Yeah. But It is true and I think that that question of

348
00:21:33,615 --> 00:21:36,675
Speaker 2:  not only like how does this affect me, but how does this affect you? You

349
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:40,235
Speaker 2:  don't know the sort of second, third and fourth order effects that this data

350
00:21:40,235 --> 00:21:43,275
Speaker 2:  being out there has. And this is the thing we've learned over and over, right,

351
00:21:43,275 --> 00:21:47,035
Speaker 2:  that like the, the location data in your phone and the, the usage data on

352
00:21:47,035 --> 00:21:50,795
Speaker 2:  social networks like this stuff actually affects a much broader circle

353
00:21:50,855 --> 00:21:54,755
Speaker 2:  of people than just you as it gets out there. Yeah. And I think

354
00:21:54,755 --> 00:21:57,755
Speaker 2:  It is, like that's a, that's a useful thing to hold onto, especially in this

355
00:21:57,755 --> 00:21:58,955
Speaker 2:  particular case I think.

356
00:21:59,545 --> 00:22:03,435
Speaker 6:  Yeah, there was actually just a, an instance of a lawyer

357
00:22:03,535 --> 00:22:07,435
Speaker 6:  who was coming back to the US with his family from spring break. US

358
00:22:07,435 --> 00:22:11,035
Speaker 6:  citizen lawyer, the agents at

359
00:22:11,075 --> 00:22:14,835
Speaker 6:  CBP at the airport, like tried to look through his phone. He got

360
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:18,595
Speaker 6:  away with like just a basic search, basically not a

361
00:22:18,835 --> 00:22:22,715
Speaker 6:  forensic search. They didn't back up his information, but it's like his client's

362
00:22:22,715 --> 00:22:25,995
Speaker 6:  information is on that phone. There was another instance where CBP

363
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:30,635
Speaker 6:  took an immigration lawyer's phone and you know, they did like

364
00:22:31,495 --> 00:22:35,475
Speaker 6:  use the forensic search to like comb through what was on it. And a lot

365
00:22:35,475 --> 00:22:38,795
Speaker 6:  of that of what was on it was like client information. Hmm.

366
00:22:39,935 --> 00:22:43,795
Speaker 6:  And so, you know, a lot of us, myself included, use our phones for

367
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:47,675
Speaker 6:  work, for personal things and there's

368
00:22:47,675 --> 00:22:50,435
Speaker 6:  not just information about me on my phone, there's information about my friends,

369
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:54,235
Speaker 6:  there's information about my family, there's information about like my sources.

370
00:22:55,855 --> 00:22:59,675
Speaker 6:  And so I I would say like it's, it's really important for everyone

371
00:22:59,695 --> 00:23:03,635
Speaker 6:  and it's like especially important for like journalists or lawyers or

372
00:23:03,635 --> 00:23:06,075
Speaker 6:  people who have like sensitive information on their phones.

373
00:23:06,935 --> 00:23:10,875
Speaker 2:  So given all of that, do you think that selective deletion strategy

374
00:23:11,145 --> 00:23:14,875
Speaker 2:  even makes sense? Like is there a sort of half measure people can take

375
00:23:15,155 --> 00:23:19,035
Speaker 2:  that will help them? Or is is are the possibilities here just so

376
00:23:19,035 --> 00:23:22,595
Speaker 2:  huge and broad that you, you kind of might as well

377
00:23:22,745 --> 00:23:25,915
Speaker 2:  just do the nuclear option because it's the safer way to go?

378
00:23:27,055 --> 00:23:30,735
Speaker 6:  I mean, I would say like, you know, it's still a small,

379
00:23:32,045 --> 00:23:35,255
Speaker 6:  very small percentage of people who are getting their devices searched. But

380
00:23:35,255 --> 00:23:39,175
Speaker 6:  at the same time, like realistically, how long does it take to back up

381
00:23:39,175 --> 00:23:42,695
Speaker 6:  your data and wipe your phone and then put everything back on?

382
00:23:45,145 --> 00:23:49,125
Speaker 6:  But it's also annoying to sit in a weird interrogation room

383
00:23:49,265 --> 00:23:52,685
Speaker 6:  for hours and have law enforcement looking through your phone.

384
00:23:53,545 --> 00:23:57,255
Speaker 6:  So I would say I'm not gonna tell anybody what they should do,

385
00:23:57,835 --> 00:24:01,575
Speaker 6:  but I think that the wise, this course of action

386
00:24:02,035 --> 00:24:06,015
Speaker 6:  is to minimize your risk as much as possible. And maybe

387
00:24:06,015 --> 00:24:09,855
Speaker 6:  that means wiping down your phone entirely. Maybe that means like typing

388
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:13,655
Speaker 6:  in keywords that you don't want people to see and then

389
00:24:13,695 --> 00:24:17,055
Speaker 6:  deleting whatever fits into those keywords. I think just like the main thing

390
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:19,575
Speaker 6:  to do is assess your risk as much as possible and

391
00:24:21,235 --> 00:24:24,175
Speaker 6:  try to protect yourself as much as possible. And then also,

392
00:24:24,995 --> 00:24:28,385
Speaker 6:  especially If you are a US citizen, like assert your rights as much as possible

393
00:24:28,525 --> 00:24:28,865
Speaker 6:  as well.

394
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:33,265
Speaker 2:  Yeah, yeah, that's a good one. And If you delete things, you have to then

395
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:37,105
Speaker 2:  go to trash and delete them again. Delete permanently is the phrase you wanna

396
00:24:37,105 --> 00:24:40,065
Speaker 2:  look for in almost every case because that's when they're actually deleted.

397
00:24:40,885 --> 00:24:43,305
Speaker 2:  All right. Last thing and then we'll let you go. How do you think about this

398
00:24:43,305 --> 00:24:47,225
Speaker 2:  stuff as it pertains to other devices? I think phones are unique in

399
00:24:47,225 --> 00:24:51,065
Speaker 2:  that they have that sort of massive information that you're talking about,

400
00:24:51,405 --> 00:24:54,425
Speaker 2:  but also like I travel with my laptop. Should people think about their laptops

401
00:24:54,425 --> 00:24:57,345
Speaker 2:  the same way they think about their phones? Or are all devices kind of looped

402
00:24:57,345 --> 00:24:57,585
Speaker 2:  into this?

403
00:24:58,185 --> 00:25:02,105
Speaker 6:  I would say all devices are looped into this. I kind of

404
00:25:02,105 --> 00:25:05,625
Speaker 6:  wanna do a separate piece on laptops because I also travel with my laptop.

405
00:25:05,745 --> 00:25:09,585
Speaker 6:  I have so much stuff on my laptop, I do not want to put everything

406
00:25:09,585 --> 00:25:11,985
Speaker 6:  like, I don't know, like on an external hard driver in the cloud and then

407
00:25:11,985 --> 00:25:14,425
Speaker 6:  backed on my laptop. Like that frankly sounds like really annoying and time

408
00:25:14,425 --> 00:25:15,745
Speaker 6:  consuming. Yeah. Resetting your

409
00:25:15,745 --> 00:25:18,545
Speaker 2:  Laptop is way more annoying than resetting your phone. Yeah.

410
00:25:19,095 --> 00:25:22,905
Speaker 6:  Yeah. So I'm not sure about that to be honest. I will

411
00:25:22,965 --> 00:25:26,785
Speaker 6:  say that my old MacBook does not have biometric

412
00:25:26,785 --> 00:25:30,465
Speaker 6:  login, which is great for me in this particular

413
00:25:30,785 --> 00:25:34,745
Speaker 6:  instance. And yeah, I, I don't know. That's a good

414
00:25:34,945 --> 00:25:38,785
Speaker 6:  question and I think one I should probably call up some lawyers about

415
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:40,945
Speaker 6:  'cause I'm not a hundred percent sure.

416
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:43,905
Speaker 2:  Okay. But in principle, If you're, if you're traveling now, you should be

417
00:25:44,065 --> 00:25:47,505
Speaker 2:  applying kind of the same thinking and rigor to all of your devices, not

418
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:48,385
Speaker 2:  just your smartphone.

419
00:25:48,685 --> 00:25:51,945
Speaker 6:  Yes, yes, definitely. Okay. And like smartphones, you know, are

420
00:25:52,475 --> 00:25:56,185
Speaker 6:  maybe easier to lock down, also easier to search,

421
00:25:56,285 --> 00:25:58,785
Speaker 6:  but there's a lot of stuff on my laptop.

422
00:25:59,575 --> 00:25:59,865
Speaker 2:  Yeah.

423
00:26:00,285 --> 00:26:01,505
Speaker 6:  Lot of J store articles.

424
00:26:03,055 --> 00:26:06,825
Speaker 2:  Yeah. Like think of the PDFs I have. We both have just like randomly kicking

425
00:26:06,825 --> 00:26:09,745
Speaker 2:  around in our downloads folder. I'm confident some of those would get me

426
00:26:09,745 --> 00:26:12,185
Speaker 2:  in trouble. I don't even know what they are, but I am confident they would

427
00:26:12,185 --> 00:26:12,705
Speaker 2:  get me in trouble.

428
00:26:13,165 --> 00:26:16,385
Speaker 6:  Oh, for sure. Same. I know, I know what mine are. And they're, they're weird.

429
00:26:16,385 --> 00:26:20,105
Speaker 6:  They're weird. Even like when I'm showing something, like when I'm sharing

430
00:26:20,165 --> 00:26:22,745
Speaker 6:  my screen, I'm always like, no, no, no guys. And you don't understand. It's

431
00:26:22,905 --> 00:26:25,625
Speaker 6:  research. It's research, I swear. Yeah,

432
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:29,345
Speaker 2:  Exactly. There is a part of the challenge here that there is so much kind

433
00:26:29,345 --> 00:26:32,185
Speaker 2:  of mystery in it. And like you, you mentioned in the piece that you wrote

434
00:26:32,185 --> 00:26:35,865
Speaker 2:  that even what airport you land in could change the way that you go through

435
00:26:35,865 --> 00:26:39,105
Speaker 2:  some of this process because of the different ways that different districts

436
00:26:39,105 --> 00:26:42,185
Speaker 2:  of federal courts have ruled about how these searches can work. So it's like,

437
00:26:42,505 --> 00:26:46,245
Speaker 2:  I think my sense is It is in part designed to be

438
00:26:46,245 --> 00:26:49,965
Speaker 2:  complex and hard to understand, which makes it all the more important that

439
00:26:49,965 --> 00:26:53,525
Speaker 2:  like you as the person going through it understand what is in your rights

440
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:53,885
Speaker 2:  to do.

441
00:26:54,475 --> 00:26:58,125
Speaker 6:  Yeah, yeah, totally. It's like it's, I mean, I just like having to read about

442
00:26:58,125 --> 00:27:01,005
Speaker 6:  circuit splits to write this piece. I was like, I'm not a lawyer, I'm not

443
00:27:01,005 --> 00:27:04,205
Speaker 6:  a lawyer, I'm not a lawyer. What's going on? And I was talking to lawyers

444
00:27:04,265 --> 00:27:07,725
Speaker 6:  and lawyers are like, yeah, this is really complicated. It's really complicated.

445
00:27:07,725 --> 00:27:11,485
Speaker 6:  It doesn't make any sense. We have begged the Supreme Court

446
00:27:11,585 --> 00:27:15,445
Speaker 6:  to rule so that there's like a single national binding

447
00:27:15,945 --> 00:27:19,685
Speaker 6:  policy and there isn't one. But at the same time, like I don't

448
00:27:19,885 --> 00:27:23,845
Speaker 6:  want people to think too much about like the circuit splits and the

449
00:27:23,845 --> 00:27:27,485
Speaker 6:  different jurisdictions because ultimately like the, the rulings and the

450
00:27:27,485 --> 00:27:31,205
Speaker 6:  differences are mostly about forensic searches. The, the legal question

451
00:27:31,205 --> 00:27:35,005
Speaker 6:  hasn't really been raised for basic searches, which means like they could

452
00:27:35,005 --> 00:27:37,125
Speaker 6:  do basic searches basically anywhere.

453
00:27:38,985 --> 00:27:42,885
Speaker 6:  And you know, once again, If you volunteer your phone,

454
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:47,605
Speaker 6:  you, If you say no, then there's like a whole situation with like legality

455
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:55,525
Speaker 2:  we're, we're sort of running at each other in the tech industry right now.

456
00:30:55,525 --> 00:30:56,845
Speaker 2:  And that's, that's what I wanna talk about.

457
00:30:57,045 --> 00:30:59,205
Speaker 11:  I was the last guy with a Blackberry. Yeah.

458
00:30:59,885 --> 00:31:02,365
Speaker 2:  I feel like everyone in LA was the last guy with a Blackberry.

459
00:31:02,555 --> 00:31:05,805
Speaker 11:  They were very popular here. I don't know why. Maybe the, we were just kind

460
00:31:05,805 --> 00:31:07,725
Speaker 11:  of afraid of losing the keyboard.

461
00:31:08,395 --> 00:31:11,565
Speaker 2:  Yeah. There was something too though. Like everybody in LA wrote really long

462
00:31:11,565 --> 00:31:15,485
Speaker 2:  emails way after it was cool to write long emails is is a theory it

463
00:31:15,485 --> 00:31:19,205
Speaker 2:  developed. So I think, I think I wanna start with Apple because I have, I

464
00:31:19,205 --> 00:31:22,445
Speaker 2:  have like a big picture question I wanna talk about, but I think the easiest

465
00:31:22,545 --> 00:31:25,045
Speaker 2:  way to talk about It is probably by talking about Apple tv,

466
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:30,205
Speaker 2:  which is on a run of like pretty good hits. Severance was huge.

467
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:34,005
Speaker 2:  Everybody's excited about severance. The studio seems to be very good. You're

468
00:31:34,005 --> 00:31:37,125
Speaker 2:  in it. So you're hopelessly compromised. I

469
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:40,725
Speaker 11:  Am, yes. I'm not gonna trash my own show. The the

470
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:42,085
Speaker 11:  three scenes I'm in.

471
00:31:42,545 --> 00:31:45,125
Speaker 2:  The good news is it seems to be very good. So I think you're, you're safe

472
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:49,025
Speaker 2:  on that front and yet the, there's been some reporting that

473
00:31:49,025 --> 00:31:52,865
Speaker 2:  Apple is losing up to a billion dollars a year on this whole

474
00:31:52,865 --> 00:31:56,825
Speaker 2:  project. So I guess maybe the easiest place to start is why is this not working

475
00:31:57,285 --> 00:31:58,905
Speaker 2:  for Apple as a business?

476
00:31:59,215 --> 00:32:02,185
Speaker 11:  Well do we know that it's not working? Just because they're losing money

477
00:32:02,455 --> 00:32:05,985
Speaker 11:  doesn't mean that the entire endeavor is not working.

478
00:32:06,415 --> 00:32:10,265
Speaker 11:  It's just not working on traditional metrics where you have

479
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:14,145
Speaker 11:  a p and l and you get into a business to make money in

480
00:32:14,145 --> 00:32:17,745
Speaker 11:  that business. Apple seems from the very

481
00:32:17,745 --> 00:32:21,425
Speaker 11:  beginning to approach Hollywood from two

482
00:32:21,505 --> 00:32:25,425
Speaker 11:  perspectives. One, this would be a brand halo, this would be

483
00:32:25,425 --> 00:32:29,185
Speaker 11:  something nice that they could do that would give them something cool to

484
00:32:29,185 --> 00:32:33,105
Speaker 11:  talk about. And they would work with the kinds of stars that they as

485
00:32:33,105 --> 00:32:36,745
Speaker 11:  Apple consider themselves worthy of working with. And

486
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:40,645
Speaker 11:  they would put out some shows and have a service that would be

487
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:44,765
Speaker 11:  additive to their services business, which they seem to care very much about

488
00:32:44,855 --> 00:32:48,605
Speaker 11:  these days and would give them something cool to put in

489
00:32:48,605 --> 00:32:52,005
Speaker 11:  commercials and to talk about in tweets and on earnings calls.

490
00:32:52,315 --> 00:32:54,605
Speaker 11:  That was one reason. The second was to

491
00:32:55,635 --> 00:32:59,005
Speaker 11:  essentially provide a

492
00:32:59,725 --> 00:33:03,525
Speaker 11:  bundling opportunity with their other services if they could

493
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:07,485
Speaker 11:  keep you longer in the Apple ecosystem because they had

494
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:11,325
Speaker 11:  Apple One and they had news and games and

495
00:33:11,505 --> 00:33:15,005
Speaker 11:  you know, television shows that you've heard of that that would be

496
00:33:15,605 --> 00:33:19,525
Speaker 11:  additive to their other businesses. So I think

497
00:33:19,525 --> 00:33:23,285
Speaker 11:  when we talk about the failure in Hollywood, there's

498
00:33:23,285 --> 00:33:26,725
Speaker 11:  legitimate things they're not doing that they should be doing in my opinion.

499
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:30,325
Speaker 11:  But I don't know that we can say that they're not getting out of this what

500
00:33:30,325 --> 00:33:31,805
Speaker 11:  they wanted to get out of it.

501
00:33:32,585 --> 00:33:36,405
Speaker 2:  That's fair. I mean, and I think the, the question

502
00:33:36,465 --> 00:33:40,405
Speaker 2:  of does it matter if Apple TV plus makes any money? Seems like it has

503
00:33:40,635 --> 00:33:44,485
Speaker 2:  been sitting there for Apple since it started this project and I feel

504
00:33:44,485 --> 00:33:48,405
Speaker 2:  like I, I'm curious how you see the brand halo piece of all of

505
00:33:48,405 --> 00:33:51,325
Speaker 2:  this, because to me it's like, I, I remember back when they first launched

506
00:33:51,325 --> 00:33:54,485
Speaker 2:  this thing and do you remember they had that event that they just like paraded

507
00:33:54,525 --> 00:33:56,565
Speaker 2:  a bunch of a-list celebrities out on stage?

508
00:33:56,905 --> 00:33:58,885
Speaker 11:  Oh yeah. It was the cattle call, right?

509
00:33:58,885 --> 00:34:02,405
Speaker 2:  And so it's like, is is, is this entire endeavor worth it just

510
00:34:02,785 --> 00:34:05,925
Speaker 2:  for that? Like, is that what Apple needs to get out of it and it can just

511
00:34:05,925 --> 00:34:08,125
Speaker 2:  sell a bunch of iPhones and who cares about the money? Like is the brand

512
00:34:08,155 --> 00:34:11,565
Speaker 2:  Halo real enough that it's actually worth it for this company?

513
00:34:13,045 --> 00:34:16,575
Speaker 11:  Well, you'd have to ask them, but I think from my perspective, it was

514
00:34:16,575 --> 00:34:20,535
Speaker 11:  meaningful for them to get all of these celebrities up to Cupertino. Remember

515
00:34:20,535 --> 00:34:24,215
Speaker 11:  the famous Oprah line? Like they're in a billion pockets, y'all. Yeah.

516
00:34:24,445 --> 00:34:27,575
Speaker 11:  Like that was her reason for getting into business with Apple.

517
00:34:28,235 --> 00:34:32,215
Speaker 11:  And If you look at the choices they are making on

518
00:34:32,215 --> 00:34:35,775
Speaker 11:  the content side, one after another, It is

519
00:34:36,165 --> 00:34:39,975
Speaker 11:  huge stars. If you, I mean the, it's a joke around town. Like

520
00:34:39,975 --> 00:34:43,895
Speaker 11:  if you've got a big star filled package and you're selling

521
00:34:43,895 --> 00:34:47,735
Speaker 11:  it around town, apple will bite. Like they just want to be in business

522
00:34:47,965 --> 00:34:51,575
Speaker 11:  with big movie stars and big TV stars. And the

523
00:34:51,575 --> 00:34:55,255
Speaker 11:  criticism of them is that they don't ultimately often enough

524
00:34:55,355 --> 00:34:59,175
Speaker 11:  follow through on the promise of those stars. There's lots of projects

525
00:34:59,175 --> 00:35:03,135
Speaker 11:  that are kind of littering Apple TV plus that have big names in them, but

526
00:35:03,135 --> 00:35:06,775
Speaker 11:  don't ultimately turn into great shows. There are examples of course, of

527
00:35:06,785 --> 00:35:09,935
Speaker 11:  shows that do turn into great shows with big stars,

528
00:35:10,635 --> 00:35:14,375
Speaker 11:  but the, the, the evidence we have for whether

529
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:17,575
Speaker 11:  they're getting out of this, what they want is that they continue to sign

530
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:21,375
Speaker 11:  up big stars. And when it works there, you know, Eddie Q can go to

531
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:25,015
Speaker 11:  South by Southwest and have an hour long conversation with Ben Stiller

532
00:35:25,275 --> 00:35:29,055
Speaker 11:  and he doesn't have to talk about all the other problems that are

533
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:29,895
Speaker 11:  circling Apple.

534
00:35:31,315 --> 00:35:35,175
Speaker 2:  Is that something we see across Hollywood, this idea that like, it's

535
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:38,125
Speaker 2:  it's worth the cost to be able to sit next to Ben Stiller for an hour. Like

536
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:41,965
Speaker 2:  is this, is this sort of a long playbook run by companies in Hollywood? People

537
00:35:41,965 --> 00:35:45,445
Speaker 11:  In Hollywood don't care, they just want them to keep doing it. The biggest

538
00:35:45,445 --> 00:35:49,285
Speaker 11:  nightmare would be if Apple suddenly decided one day to get out and this

539
00:35:49,285 --> 00:35:53,005
Speaker 11:  is not worth it to them. So they have people in town are like

540
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:56,925
Speaker 11:  terrified that Eddie Q's gonna wake up one morning and be like, wait, why

541
00:35:56,925 --> 00:36:00,605
Speaker 11:  do I have that meeting in LA on my schedule? Like, why let's just not do

542
00:36:00,605 --> 00:36:04,445
Speaker 11:  that anymore. Like, that is the fear because then it would suck

543
00:36:04,565 --> 00:36:08,085
Speaker 11:  a few billion dollars out of the professionally produced content

544
00:36:08,845 --> 00:36:12,165
Speaker 11:  industry. And Apple's a big buyer of that kind of content.

545
00:36:12,785 --> 00:36:15,485
Speaker 11:  And does the average Apple customer

546
00:36:16,495 --> 00:36:20,365
Speaker 11:  think more highly about Apple because they have a

547
00:36:20,365 --> 00:36:24,205
Speaker 11:  John Ham show or they produce the studio? Like

548
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:28,045
Speaker 11:  I don't know the answer to that. I mean, that's a, a Harvard Business school

549
00:36:28,045 --> 00:36:31,765
Speaker 11:  study waiting to happen. It probably doesn't hurt

550
00:36:32,745 --> 00:36:36,525
Speaker 11:  and it's a rounding error for them to be in this business.

551
00:36:37,145 --> 00:36:41,125
Speaker 11:  And it does let Tim Cook go to the Oscars and talk about it on the

552
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:45,165
Speaker 11:  earnings call and tweet about how much he loves Ted Lasso. So is that

553
00:36:45,175 --> 00:36:46,485
Speaker 11:  worth it for them maybe?

554
00:36:47,325 --> 00:36:51,055
Speaker 2:  Yeah, the, the people will pay a lot of money to have famous friends

555
00:36:51,115 --> 00:36:54,375
Speaker 2:  is a lesson I have learned over and over in, in covering this business.

556
00:36:54,985 --> 00:36:57,695
Speaker 11:  Especially when you already have a lot of money. Right,

557
00:36:58,145 --> 00:37:00,215
Speaker 2:  Right. Yeah. You already have the money. Get the famous friends.

558
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:03,495
Speaker 11:  Yeah, exactly. Like when you got everything in the world, what don't you

559
00:37:03,495 --> 00:37:07,415
Speaker 11:  have exclusivity and famous friends are exclusive and to be able to say

560
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:11,895
Speaker 11:  that we are producing a Martin Scorsese movie with

561
00:37:11,895 --> 00:37:14,055
Speaker 11:  Leonardo DiCaprio, not everyone can say that.

562
00:37:14,525 --> 00:37:17,895
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So you've kind of run at the big picture question I wanted to ask you,

563
00:37:17,895 --> 00:37:21,775
Speaker 2:  which is basically why do these big tech companies

564
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:26,055
Speaker 2:  want into Hollywood in the first place? And I think the, the way I

565
00:37:26,055 --> 00:37:30,015
Speaker 2:  think about it like It is, it's a, it's a risky business at best and a

566
00:37:30,135 --> 00:37:33,735
Speaker 2:  terrible business at worst, these companies don't

567
00:37:33,735 --> 00:37:37,615
Speaker 2:  necessarily seem to have any particular aptitude for

568
00:37:37,615 --> 00:37:41,495
Speaker 2:  it. And yet it seems like every tech company that

569
00:37:41,495 --> 00:37:44,495
Speaker 2:  hits a certain kind of status is like, okay, our next big project is we're

570
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:48,095
Speaker 2:  gonna go just headlong into the streaming wars in some way.

571
00:37:48,765 --> 00:37:51,855
Speaker 11:  Well, I think it's, it's specific to the companies. If you look at what

572
00:37:52,035 --> 00:37:55,855
Speaker 11:  Amazon is doing, for instance, I actually do think that it makes sense

573
00:37:55,855 --> 00:37:59,815
Speaker 11:  for Amazon to get into this business because look at what Amazon is,

574
00:37:59,815 --> 00:38:03,455
Speaker 11:  It is a massive retailer and television

575
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:07,695
Speaker 11:  is a massive retail product. If they can be the

576
00:38:07,695 --> 00:38:11,655
Speaker 11:  next generation gatekeeper of all television, that is a

577
00:38:11,655 --> 00:38:15,575
Speaker 11:  good business for them to be in. And by the way, it would also help

578
00:38:15,845 --> 00:38:19,375
Speaker 11:  keep people in the prime ecosystem and sell them more toilet paper.

579
00:38:19,835 --> 00:38:23,535
Speaker 11:  So Amazon, I think is the poster

580
00:38:23,785 --> 00:38:27,375
Speaker 11:  child for what a tech company can get out of Hollywood

581
00:38:27,715 --> 00:38:30,735
Speaker 11:  if they do it right. And I think the jury's still out on whether they are

582
00:38:30,865 --> 00:38:34,695
Speaker 11:  doing it right or whether they can turn this into a massive

583
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:38,285
Speaker 11:  business. They think at Amazon, they think that Prime video is gonna be

584
00:38:38,285 --> 00:38:42,045
Speaker 11:  profitable in the next year or two. And if that's the case, then good for

585
00:38:42,045 --> 00:38:45,165
Speaker 11:  them. They spend a lot of money and they are making headway there. And,

586
00:38:45,225 --> 00:38:49,045
Speaker 11:  and in some ways they have a leg up on Apple because

587
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:52,565
Speaker 11:  what did Apple do this past year? They put Apple TV plus in the

588
00:38:53,065 --> 00:38:56,925
Speaker 11:  Amazon Prime channels, right? Business. They essentially

589
00:38:57,135 --> 00:39:00,845
Speaker 11:  bowed down to Amazon and said, okay, we need you to

590
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:04,125
Speaker 11:  sell our product. We Apple, the biggest company in the world,

591
00:39:04,715 --> 00:39:08,445
Speaker 11:  need Amazon to get people to subscribe to Apple TV Plus.

592
00:39:08,505 --> 00:39:12,005
Speaker 11:  And it's working, they are getting a lot of subscribers through the Amazon

593
00:39:12,005 --> 00:39:15,765
Speaker 11:  channels program as are all the other services. And that is the end

594
00:39:15,765 --> 00:39:19,245
Speaker 11:  game. Just like Amazon wants to sell you four different

595
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:23,285
Speaker 11:  varieties of recliner, they also want to sell you four

596
00:39:23,285 --> 00:39:25,725
Speaker 11:  different varieties of programming.

597
00:39:26,385 --> 00:39:29,845
Speaker 2:  But is is, is it definite? Are we sure that you then

598
00:39:30,195 --> 00:39:34,125
Speaker 2:  need your own massive slate of content

599
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:37,685
Speaker 2:  and you need to spend eight and a half billion dollars on MGM in order to

600
00:39:37,685 --> 00:39:41,005
Speaker 2:  do that? Like, I actually get the retail side of that for Amazon in particular.

601
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:44,045
Speaker 2:  That makes a lot of sense. But do you need your own

602
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:46,725
Speaker 2:  Hollywood universe in order to be that company?

603
00:39:48,075 --> 00:39:51,605
Speaker 11:  It's a differentiator for sure. I mean, there's a lot of these companies

604
00:39:51,605 --> 00:39:55,285
Speaker 11:  out there like Roku and DirecTV that don't produce their

605
00:39:55,385 --> 00:39:59,285
Speaker 11:  own shows on that scale. And Amazon believes

606
00:39:59,285 --> 00:40:03,205
Speaker 11:  that if it owns enough of this stuff and can use it as a lure to

607
00:40:03,205 --> 00:40:06,645
Speaker 11:  bring people into the ecosystem, then that is a differentiator.

608
00:40:07,545 --> 00:40:11,445
Speaker 11:  And I think I agree there. I think that the, the, the fact that

609
00:40:11,445 --> 00:40:14,805
Speaker 11:  they have original programming that people do watch, I mean these shows

610
00:40:14,805 --> 00:40:18,365
Speaker 11:  like Reacher and Cross and you know, the kind of guy with a gun

611
00:40:18,455 --> 00:40:22,445
Speaker 11:  shows, people are watching that stuff on Amazon, obviously now they have

612
00:40:22,685 --> 00:40:26,445
Speaker 11:  Thursday night football, which has been a big deal for them and it costs

613
00:40:26,445 --> 00:40:29,685
Speaker 11:  nothing but money, which is what they have. And they are in business with

614
00:40:29,685 --> 00:40:33,125
Speaker 11:  the NFL, which is the most premium video product there is.

615
00:40:33,505 --> 00:40:37,405
Speaker 11:  So I, I do think it's a differentiator and it, and it sets them apart from

616
00:40:37,405 --> 00:40:38,245
Speaker 11:  some of these just

617
00:40:39,885 --> 00:40:43,005
Speaker 11:  platforms. It's, it's, it's a pro the programming does matter. Maybe not

618
00:40:43,005 --> 00:40:46,845
Speaker 11:  on that scale, and maybe they won't do it forever, but I think it does matter.

619
00:40:47,385 --> 00:40:51,205
Speaker 2:  I'm particularly Chris when companies like that come into Hollywood and they're

620
00:40:51,205 --> 00:40:54,125
Speaker 2:  like, we, we are going to invest in streaming in some meaningful way, we're

621
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:57,845
Speaker 2:  gonna start making content. They all have essentially unlimited amounts of

622
00:40:57,845 --> 00:41:01,725
Speaker 2:  money. What's what's, what happens in Hollywood when one of those

623
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:05,765
Speaker 2:  companies shows up? Is it just like, oh, thank God another money

624
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:08,645
Speaker 2:  fountain that they're just gonna have to come buy our stuff and everybody's

625
00:41:08,645 --> 00:41:09,165
Speaker 2:  psyched about it?

626
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:13,165
Speaker 11:  Well, yes, I think that's certainly part of it,

627
00:41:13,785 --> 00:41:17,525
Speaker 11:  but then it becomes what do they actually want and what are they

628
00:41:17,765 --> 00:41:21,485
Speaker 11:  actually going to do for my creators? And that's the

629
00:41:21,485 --> 00:41:25,125
Speaker 11:  representative community when they're looking at this. And I remember when

630
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:29,005
Speaker 11:  YouTube started doing professionally produced shows, it

631
00:41:29,005 --> 00:41:32,645
Speaker 11:  wasn't just whether Google had the money to make them, obviously everybody

632
00:41:32,695 --> 00:41:36,485
Speaker 11:  knows they do. It was, okay, how

633
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:40,725
Speaker 11:  is this gonna be produced? Are you, are you doing this via the unions?

634
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:43,645
Speaker 11:  You know, that's a big thing. Netflix, the first thing they did when they

635
00:41:43,645 --> 00:41:46,925
Speaker 11:  got into original programming was, we are gonna play by the rules and we're

636
00:41:46,925 --> 00:41:50,485
Speaker 11:  going to, we do union contracts with all of the different unions.

637
00:41:50,655 --> 00:41:53,845
Speaker 11:  We're going to pay people differently. They're gonna give you more money

638
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:57,725
Speaker 11:  than your quote upfront, but they're not gonna pay back ends. And that

639
00:41:57,725 --> 00:42:00,485
Speaker 11:  was a big shift for the industry and everybody went along with it because

640
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:04,125
Speaker 11:  they were making more money upfront. And when YouTube started doing this,

641
00:42:04,225 --> 00:42:08,165
Speaker 11:  it was, how is this gonna be displayed? Is my show gonna be a

642
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:12,045
Speaker 11:  pop-up video next to a cat falling downstairs? Or

643
00:42:12,045 --> 00:42:16,005
Speaker 11:  is this gonna be presented in a premium elevated

644
00:42:16,705 --> 00:42:20,525
Speaker 11:  app format where you go to a separate area and then the premium

645
00:42:20,735 --> 00:42:23,805
Speaker 11:  shows play? And I think those are all the questions that people get asked.

646
00:42:23,855 --> 00:42:27,485
Speaker 11:  Still to this day, people complain about the Amazon interface

647
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:31,685
Speaker 11:  and it's hard to find stuff and it looks like a retail store and

648
00:42:31,705 --> 00:42:35,605
Speaker 11:  that's a factor. The, the Apple interface is super elegant and

649
00:42:35,605 --> 00:42:39,045
Speaker 11:  looks like an Apple product and people like that and their shows

650
00:42:39,595 --> 00:42:43,365
Speaker 11:  look like they're expensive and they are it, how are you gonna market

651
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:47,125
Speaker 11:  this? That's the other thing is that Netflix doesn't

652
00:42:47,325 --> 00:42:50,845
Speaker 11:  do very much marketing. They have an algorithm that does most of the marketing

653
00:42:50,945 --> 00:42:54,905
Speaker 11:  for them. So outside of the awards context, you're not

654
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:58,705
Speaker 11:  gonna get much marketing for Netflix. And Apple and Amazon have said, okay,

655
00:42:58,705 --> 00:43:02,065
Speaker 11:  we will actually market your shows. And I think it depends on who you are

656
00:43:02,085 --> 00:43:05,785
Speaker 11:  as to whether you actually get that, but those are all the things that

657
00:43:06,165 --> 00:43:09,065
Speaker 11:  you look at when, when the tech companies come to town.

658
00:43:09,605 --> 00:43:13,465
Speaker 2:  And is that kind of the list that any new entrant in this

659
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:16,865
Speaker 2:  space would have to come up with? Like If you, if you're a

660
00:43:17,325 --> 00:43:21,065
Speaker 2:  any studio or distributor, are you having to answer those same questions?

661
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:24,145
Speaker 2:  Like is there anything different when it's these tech companies that are

662
00:43:24,225 --> 00:43:24,865
Speaker 2:  trying to do this?

663
00:43:25,285 --> 00:43:28,945
Speaker 11:  The the thing that's different, I think is the, the

664
00:43:29,145 --> 00:43:32,905
Speaker 11:  question of presentation. Because in the old

665
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:36,545
Speaker 11:  format, you kind of knew what a movie was, you knew what a show was. You

666
00:43:36,545 --> 00:43:39,425
Speaker 11:  knew If you sold it to NBC it was gonna get a certain kind of treatment.

667
00:43:39,425 --> 00:43:42,705
Speaker 11:  You could argue over the marketing and you could argue over the time slot

668
00:43:42,805 --> 00:43:46,585
Speaker 11:  and all that stuff. And in movies, you, you argue over the release

669
00:43:46,585 --> 00:43:49,345
Speaker 11:  commitment, whether you're getting a wide release, whether you're getting

670
00:43:49,465 --> 00:43:52,945
Speaker 11:  a, a platform release, the marketing spend associated with it

671
00:43:53,405 --> 00:43:56,985
Speaker 11:  on these platforms. There's a a fear of just being

672
00:43:58,145 --> 00:44:01,635
Speaker 11:  churned up by the algorithm Hmm. And not being

673
00:44:02,025 --> 00:44:05,805
Speaker 11:  presented in a way that your art is should be

674
00:44:05,805 --> 00:44:09,765
Speaker 11:  presented. And when I talk to representatives, they really try to

675
00:44:09,765 --> 00:44:12,845
Speaker 11:  think about that. And some places like Netflix say, you gotta, you know,

676
00:44:12,845 --> 00:44:16,365
Speaker 11:  you gotta trust us. This is what we do. We will find the right

677
00:44:16,765 --> 00:44:20,725
Speaker 11:  audience for your show. Others, you could have a little bit more of a

678
00:44:20,725 --> 00:44:24,565
Speaker 11:  conversation. What's the marketing gonna be on this? Where, where

679
00:44:24,565 --> 00:44:28,325
Speaker 11:  am what am I gonna get for a theatrical release for my

680
00:44:28,325 --> 00:44:32,245
Speaker 11:  movie? And you know, the, the F1 movie that Apple is releasing

681
00:44:32,245 --> 00:44:36,125
Speaker 11:  this summer, they guaranteed at least a 45 day window

682
00:44:36,305 --> 00:44:39,405
Speaker 11:  in theaters. We'll see how long it ultimately ends up getting beyond that.

683
00:44:39,905 --> 00:44:43,685
Speaker 11:  But that was the, a big reason why that F1 movie

684
00:44:43,835 --> 00:44:47,165
Speaker 11:  went to Apple and not to Netflix or one of the others because

685
00:44:47,555 --> 00:44:51,005
Speaker 11:  they got a guaranteed theatrical release. So those are, so those are some

686
00:44:51,005 --> 00:44:52,525
Speaker 11:  of the considerations. There's

687
00:44:52,525 --> 00:44:56,045
Speaker 2:  An interesting disconnect sort of inherent in all that, that you've written

688
00:44:56,045 --> 00:44:59,805
Speaker 2:  about a bunch over the years. And like I, you always use the word content

689
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:02,325
Speaker 2:  as sort of a shorthand for the difference in how these people talk about

690
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:05,725
Speaker 2:  it, which I really like the C word. Yeah. We talk about it all the time too.

691
00:45:05,725 --> 00:45:08,845
Speaker 2:  It's right. It's like what is, what is art and what is content? Yeah.

692
00:45:08,925 --> 00:45:12,325
Speaker 11:  I mean that was the big problem at Amazon is the head of the studio referred

693
00:45:12,325 --> 00:45:16,285
Speaker 11:  to a James Bond movie as content and the producer of the

694
00:45:16,285 --> 00:45:17,885
Speaker 11:  James Bond movie did not like that.

695
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:20,805
Speaker 2:  Yeah. So that's actually the exact example I was about to ask you about.

696
00:45:20,805 --> 00:45:24,605
Speaker 2:  Like, I think the, the whole saga with Bond and the broccoli and

697
00:45:24,825 --> 00:45:28,725
Speaker 2:  the, that, the great quote where, you know, she hates everybody at Amazon.

698
00:45:30,575 --> 00:45:34,325
Speaker 2:  Still not perfect relations everywhere. But I, I remember years ago there,

699
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:38,045
Speaker 2:  there was this feeling that like, the tech people don't get us Hollywood

700
00:45:38,045 --> 00:45:40,725
Speaker 2:  people and the tech people were like, shut up. We have all the money. And

701
00:45:41,545 --> 00:45:44,285
Speaker 2:  has that gotten better over time? Like, have these, have these groups of

702
00:45:44,285 --> 00:45:45,725
Speaker 2:  people figured each other out a little more?

703
00:45:46,435 --> 00:45:50,045
Speaker 11:  Well, the interesting thing is that slowly but surely these tech

704
00:45:50,365 --> 00:45:54,165
Speaker 11:  companies have been populated by traditional studio people.

705
00:45:54,405 --> 00:45:57,765
Speaker 11:  Hmm. If you look at the people that are running the content

706
00:45:57,895 --> 00:46:01,285
Speaker 11:  operations at Apple, Amazon, and Netflix, they're all

707
00:46:01,395 --> 00:46:05,205
Speaker 11:  traditional Hollywood people. Bella Baia ran the content

708
00:46:05,205 --> 00:46:08,885
Speaker 11:  group at NBC and now she's the chief content officer at Netflix. Jen

709
00:46:09,045 --> 00:46:12,765
Speaker 11:  Salki, who just ended up leaving, but she was also an NBC

710
00:46:12,915 --> 00:46:16,285
Speaker 11:  executive before she went to Amazon. And over at

711
00:46:16,615 --> 00:46:20,165
Speaker 11:  Apple, the top content executives ran Sony Pictures television and they

712
00:46:20,165 --> 00:46:23,805
Speaker 11:  were big producers. So, you know, and, and on the movie side they pop so

713
00:46:23,945 --> 00:46:27,765
Speaker 11:  slowly but surely, at least in the Hollywood groups, I'm not talking

714
00:46:27,765 --> 00:46:30,885
Speaker 11:  about the people who work in Los Gatos for Netflix,

715
00:46:31,585 --> 00:46:35,245
Speaker 11:  but the Hollywood people are Hollywood people. So there's a level of

716
00:46:35,245 --> 00:46:38,925
Speaker 11:  comfort that the, the representation and talent

717
00:46:38,925 --> 00:46:42,885
Speaker 11:  community has with those people because they're one of their own now

718
00:46:42,975 --> 00:46:46,925
Speaker 11:  often that will butt up against the instincts of

719
00:46:46,985 --> 00:46:50,925
Speaker 11:  the tech companies. And that's when you see conflicts

720
00:46:50,925 --> 00:46:54,645
Speaker 11:  and it comes to a head all the time at Netflix where they absolutely do

721
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:58,005
Speaker 11:  not want to put movies in theaters. And obviously the artists all want their

722
00:46:58,005 --> 00:47:01,885
Speaker 11:  movies in theaters and they lose projects Right. And left

723
00:47:01,915 --> 00:47:05,405
Speaker 11:  over that. And they want traditional marketing. Netflix doesn't do that

724
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:09,165
Speaker 11:  because they have the algorithm and there's a, an interface where, you know,

725
00:47:09,185 --> 00:47:13,125
Speaker 11:  the creatives would love for the credits of their shows and movies

726
00:47:13,265 --> 00:47:16,965
Speaker 11:  to play after they air. But the Netflix model

727
00:47:17,145 --> 00:47:21,005
Speaker 11:  is to push, push, push to the next piece of content. So it starts

728
00:47:21,075 --> 00:47:24,645
Speaker 11:  autoplaying before you even see any credits. Correct. Like that's what you

729
00:47:24,645 --> 00:47:28,125
Speaker 11:  have to live with if you're working with those services. But I guess in

730
00:47:28,125 --> 00:47:30,125
Speaker 11:  the words of Don Draper, that's what the money's for.

731
00:47:30,595 --> 00:47:33,325
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I always get a kick out of, whenever you're watching something with

732
00:47:33,325 --> 00:47:36,725
Speaker 2:  a post credit scene, you have to like work really hard to go find it because

733
00:47:36,725 --> 00:47:39,605
Speaker 2:  Netflix is desperate to just get you off the credits and onto something else.

734
00:47:39,605 --> 00:47:41,885
Speaker 2:  And I'm like, no, no, I'd actually, I'd actually like to watch this Netflix.

735
00:47:41,885 --> 00:47:42,205
Speaker 2:  Thank

736
00:47:42,205 --> 00:47:45,125
Speaker 11:  You. Yeah. It's annoying. I know. And, and like makes me feel a hundred

737
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:48,885
Speaker 11:  years old, but it's like, why, why are we already on the next show? And

738
00:47:48,885 --> 00:47:52,285
Speaker 11:  I get it. Like it, you know, it used to be that those would count as views

739
00:47:52,795 --> 00:47:56,085
Speaker 11:  when the autoplay started a new episode of a show.

740
00:47:56,585 --> 00:47:59,765
Speaker 11:  All it would take is like 30 seconds or a minute and Netflix would count

741
00:47:59,765 --> 00:48:02,285
Speaker 11:  it as a view. They don't do that anymore. Yeah. But yeah, it was kind of

742
00:48:02,285 --> 00:48:03,285
Speaker 11:  a fraud. Yeah.

743
00:48:03,285 --> 00:48:06,925
Speaker 2:  Agreed. So I feel like there's that, that kind of

744
00:48:07,755 --> 00:48:11,205
Speaker 2:  Hollywood people inside of these companies who then have to go like sit in

745
00:48:11,205 --> 00:48:13,965
Speaker 2:  conference rooms with the business people and the tech people and the product

746
00:48:13,965 --> 00:48:17,925
Speaker 2:  people, that tension, at least from where I sit, still seems

747
00:48:17,925 --> 00:48:21,445
Speaker 2:  sort of alive and well. And I feel like, oh yeah, this is a thing that, that

748
00:48:21,625 --> 00:48:24,765
Speaker 2:  we hear about and cover all the time. It's like if you're, you know, you're

749
00:48:24,765 --> 00:48:27,445
Speaker 2:  Andy Jassy, you're the CEO of Amazon, and you look around and you're like,

750
00:48:27,445 --> 00:48:31,245
Speaker 2:  okay, times are tough, tariffs are coming, things are complicated.

751
00:48:31,735 --> 00:48:35,525
Speaker 2:  Where where can we pull back? And you, you look over at this thing where

752
00:48:35,525 --> 00:48:38,405
Speaker 2:  you're like, well we just spent hundreds of millions of dollars on Citadel

753
00:48:38,405 --> 00:48:42,245
Speaker 2:  this show that no one watched and was awful. That's a lot easier to

754
00:48:42,245 --> 00:48:46,085
Speaker 2:  cut than a bunch of like AWS engineers. And, and so I wonder like, it, it

755
00:48:46,085 --> 00:48:49,885
Speaker 2:  does seem like there's been a little bit of a cultural shift towards

756
00:48:50,315 --> 00:48:54,245
Speaker 2:  sort of understanding how that world works and what the investments

757
00:48:54,245 --> 00:48:57,005
Speaker 2:  look like in caring about, you know, the art. And those people seem to be

758
00:48:57,005 --> 00:49:00,845
Speaker 2:  more powerful inside of those companies than they once were. But I do

759
00:49:00,845 --> 00:49:04,685
Speaker 2:  still feel like if you're, if you're an executive at Amazon or Google

760
00:49:04,705 --> 00:49:08,285
Speaker 2:  or Apple or any of these companies, I don't feel like the Hollywood people

761
00:49:08,285 --> 00:49:09,205
Speaker 2:  are winning yet.

762
00:49:10,025 --> 00:49:13,925
Speaker 11:  That's probably true. The, the ultimate deciders

763
00:49:14,375 --> 00:49:18,245
Speaker 11:  still are in the headquarters and they're not in the LA operations.

764
00:49:18,685 --> 00:49:22,285
Speaker 11:  Hmm. And I think that that is, you know, they are, they

765
00:49:22,355 --> 00:49:26,085
Speaker 11:  operate on the whim of these, these overlords that determine

766
00:49:26,085 --> 00:49:29,485
Speaker 11:  budgets. And there have been a couple come to Jesus moments, especially

767
00:49:29,485 --> 00:49:33,125
Speaker 11:  at Apple, where they have said, listen, you know, we, we put these movies

768
00:49:33,225 --> 00:49:37,045
Speaker 11:  in theaters and they flop and they give us

769
00:49:37,225 --> 00:49:40,565
Speaker 11:  bad headlines. People write about, people write the words Apple and the

770
00:49:40,565 --> 00:49:43,765
Speaker 11:  word flop in the same headline sentence. Like, that's not what we want.

771
00:49:44,095 --> 00:49:48,045
Speaker 11:  We're Apple, we don't have flops. So, although I guess lately

772
00:49:48,045 --> 00:49:48,845
Speaker 11:  they do, but

773
00:49:49,165 --> 00:49:50,365
Speaker 2:  Yeah. More so recently. Yeah.

774
00:49:50,675 --> 00:49:53,405
Speaker 11:  They, you know, so they're like, why are we doing this? So when they had

775
00:49:53,405 --> 00:49:56,805
Speaker 11:  this movie Wolfs last summer, Clooney and Pitt, and they didn't think it

776
00:49:56,805 --> 00:50:00,165
Speaker 11:  was great, they just said, we're not doing that. Well, you know, we're gonna

777
00:50:00,265 --> 00:50:03,845
Speaker 11:  put it just on the service and there's a real question as to whether Apple's

778
00:50:03,845 --> 00:50:06,925
Speaker 11:  gonna put more movies in theaters. I think F1 this summer is a big test

779
00:50:07,075 --> 00:50:10,525
Speaker 11:  because they don't like the bad headlines. If they're not doing this for

780
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:14,645
Speaker 11:  money, essentially they're doing this for brand Halo and for services.

781
00:50:15,155 --> 00:50:18,365
Speaker 11:  Then why endure bad headlines If you don't have to?

782
00:50:19,165 --> 00:50:22,885
Speaker 2:  I feel like streaming hits are like the new cult classics where you say That

783
00:50:22,885 --> 00:50:25,965
Speaker 2:  movie was a huge failure, and everybody's like, well, no, everybody saw it

784
00:50:25,965 --> 00:50:28,045
Speaker 2:  later. They really liked it. It, it's like, sure. Well

785
00:50:28,045 --> 00:50:31,805
Speaker 11:  That's been true forever. Yeah. I remember being in, in meetings with the

786
00:50:31,965 --> 00:50:35,725
Speaker 11:  HBO people in the two thousands where they would talk about how

787
00:50:36,185 --> 00:50:39,805
Speaker 11:  all the press attention is on their original series. But when you look at

788
00:50:39,805 --> 00:50:43,565
Speaker 11:  the bread and butter of who was watching HBO, it was people watching those

789
00:50:43,865 --> 00:50:47,565
Speaker 11:  movies that they didn't see in theaters but had their first

790
00:50:47,825 --> 00:50:51,805
Speaker 11:  run on premium cable on HBO. Mm. And one of

791
00:50:51,805 --> 00:50:55,245
Speaker 11:  the biggest movies for HBO of all time was the Flop

792
00:50:55,455 --> 00:50:57,245
Speaker 11:  battleship. Remember that movie? Oh

793
00:50:57,245 --> 00:50:58,205
Speaker 2:  Yeah. I do

794
00:50:58,995 --> 00:51:02,845
Speaker 11:  Huge flop in theaters, but it had a lot of stars that had Rihanna,

795
00:51:03,245 --> 00:51:07,045
Speaker 11:  remember that it had all these like hot stars in it. And

796
00:51:07,045 --> 00:51:10,965
Speaker 11:  like there is a train wreck element when you're watching on television

797
00:51:11,395 --> 00:51:15,245
Speaker 11:  that works. The thinking in streaming is that

798
00:51:15,345 --> 00:51:18,965
Speaker 11:  the originals bring people in and the license

799
00:51:19,195 --> 00:51:23,035
Speaker 11:  content keeps them because you come in for the sexy

800
00:51:23,085 --> 00:51:26,315
Speaker 11:  title. If it's Max, you're coming in for the HBO original series

801
00:51:26,975 --> 00:51:30,915
Speaker 11:  and then you stay for the Warner Brothers library of movies and

802
00:51:30,915 --> 00:51:34,475
Speaker 11:  all the other stuff that's on Max. The knock on Apple

803
00:51:34,975 --> 00:51:38,915
Speaker 11:  is that for reasons beyond me, they have not invested in a library.

804
00:51:39,465 --> 00:51:43,435
Speaker 11:  They could license a ton of movies. They could license kids

805
00:51:43,435 --> 00:51:47,395
Speaker 11:  stuff, they could license shows from other networks. They don't

806
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:51,275
Speaker 11:  do that. It's really just a repository for their originals with

807
00:51:51,465 --> 00:51:55,395
Speaker 11:  some, some other stuff that they put in there. And as a

808
00:51:55,395 --> 00:51:58,915
Speaker 11:  result, the engagement numbers, the time spent on the

809
00:51:59,275 --> 00:52:03,155
Speaker 11:  platform are tiny Nielsen releases a gauge metric

810
00:52:03,155 --> 00:52:07,075
Speaker 11:  once a month where it tells you the percentage of

811
00:52:07,145 --> 00:52:10,715
Speaker 11:  time for each service on connected TVs. And

812
00:52:10,825 --> 00:52:14,675
Speaker 11:  obviously YouTube and Netflix are the top draws,

813
00:52:15,055 --> 00:52:18,915
Speaker 11:  but Apple doesn't even rate Apple's not even on

814
00:52:18,975 --> 00:52:22,835
Speaker 11:  the top 10 lists because the engagement numbers

815
00:52:22,895 --> 00:52:25,955
Speaker 11:  are so low because people are coming in for those five shows that they've

816
00:52:25,955 --> 00:52:28,795
Speaker 11:  heard of and that's it. They're not staying for anything else.

817
00:52:30,095 --> 00:52:33,955
Speaker 2:  So as we look ahead, we're obviously, it's a, it's a weird moment in

818
00:52:33,955 --> 00:52:37,675
Speaker 2:  the world and economy right now, but I feel like we've been,

819
00:52:38,095 --> 00:52:42,005
Speaker 2:  for years every everybody has been asking like, okay, at

820
00:52:42,005 --> 00:52:45,805
Speaker 2:  what point are some of these companies going to decide to

821
00:52:45,805 --> 00:52:49,205
Speaker 2:  just go all in on this? Apple's gonna buy Disney or Netflix,

822
00:52:50,005 --> 00:52:53,165
Speaker 2:  somebody's gonna go, Amazon's gonna go spend all the money in the known universe

823
00:52:53,165 --> 00:52:56,965
Speaker 2:  and just eat the NFL entirely. Like someone is going to fully

824
00:52:56,995 --> 00:53:00,845
Speaker 2:  like a hundred percent this strategy. And yet it hasn't happened yet.

825
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:06,125
Speaker 2:  Why? Why do you think not why haven't we seen the like full push into the

826
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:07,605
Speaker 2:  middle of the table from one of these companies?

827
00:53:07,965 --> 00:53:11,685
Speaker 11:  I, I think there's a couple reasons. First, the antitrust concerns and the

828
00:53:11,685 --> 00:53:15,005
Speaker 11:  Biden administration was so openly hostile to m and a activity

829
00:53:15,395 --> 00:53:18,725
Speaker 11:  that I think there's, there was a real sense that any effort

830
00:53:19,265 --> 00:53:23,165
Speaker 11:  on the tech company's part to buy a studio or pull off another

831
00:53:23,405 --> 00:53:27,285
Speaker 11:  MGM or Fox, Disney would be met with pretty swift resistance.

832
00:53:27,865 --> 00:53:31,485
Speaker 11:  And now under Trump, we're seeing a different kind of chaos

833
00:53:31,655 --> 00:53:35,405
Speaker 11:  where the market is so volatile that you're afraid

834
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:39,445
Speaker 11:  to do anything in this kind of environment. So that's one

835
00:53:39,445 --> 00:53:42,725
Speaker 11:  reason. Secondly, like other than the Beats acquisition,

836
00:53:43,265 --> 00:53:47,245
Speaker 11:  we have not seen Apple do anything in the m and a

837
00:53:47,245 --> 00:53:50,965
Speaker 11:  space in this arena. And all these people out there saying, well, oh,

838
00:53:50,965 --> 00:53:54,725
Speaker 11:  it's only a matter of time before they buy Disney. Really? Like, are we

839
00:53:54,725 --> 00:53:58,565
Speaker 11:  sure about that? Do you think Apple wants to be in the churro business and

840
00:53:58,565 --> 00:54:02,285
Speaker 11:  the Turkey leg business in, you know, countries around the world

841
00:54:02,425 --> 00:54:05,925
Speaker 11:  and have to deal with a kid getting eaten by an alligator, a Disney world

842
00:54:05,945 --> 00:54:09,845
Speaker 11:  and things like that? Like that's, that's what they want to be in. I I just

843
00:54:09,845 --> 00:54:13,725
Speaker 11:  don't, I just don't see that I could see them picking

844
00:54:13,825 --> 00:54:17,645
Speaker 11:  off something like Warner Brothers, which would give them HBO,

845
00:54:17,815 --> 00:54:21,805
Speaker 11:  which is what they wanted to buy a decade ago, and Time Warner

846
00:54:21,805 --> 00:54:23,165
Speaker 11:  wouldn't sell it to them. That's right.

847
00:54:23,245 --> 00:54:23,685
Speaker 2:  I forgot

848
00:54:23,685 --> 00:54:27,565
Speaker 11:  About that. And I think that that makes a little bit more sense, but again,

849
00:54:27,635 --> 00:54:31,205
Speaker 11:  that would come along with all of these dying television networks. And does

850
00:54:31,205 --> 00:54:34,685
Speaker 11:  Apple wanna be in the business of managing the decline of television?

851
00:54:35,085 --> 00:54:38,565
Speaker 11:  I mean, they could try to sell that stuff off, but that's a, that's a real

852
00:54:38,885 --> 00:54:42,645
Speaker 11:  challenge there. So there's all of these different m and a scenarios

853
00:54:42,645 --> 00:54:46,185
Speaker 11:  from the tech companies. They, they raise both

854
00:54:46,625 --> 00:54:50,425
Speaker 11:  regulatory and logistical problems and I think that's why we

855
00:54:50,425 --> 00:54:53,265
Speaker 11:  haven't seen them so far. Doesn't mean they won't happen. I'm just saying

856
00:54:53,265 --> 00:54:53,705
Speaker 11:  that's why.

857
00:54:54,295 --> 00:54:57,785
Speaker 2:  Last thing and then I'm gonna let you go. F1 you mentioned this earlier,

858
00:54:58,535 --> 00:55:01,865
Speaker 2:  strikes me as kind of a big moment for

859
00:55:02,715 --> 00:55:06,305
Speaker 2:  Apple TV plus specifically, but also this whole sort of

860
00:55:06,725 --> 00:55:10,345
Speaker 2:  big tech streaming thing. This is certainly the biggest, most

861
00:55:10,345 --> 00:55:14,225
Speaker 2:  expensive swing I can think of from one of

862
00:55:14,225 --> 00:55:17,865
Speaker 2:  these sort of big tech companies trying to make this happen. It's doing the

863
00:55:17,865 --> 00:55:21,145
Speaker 2:  theatrical thing. We've been seeing ads about it for like forever. Brad Pitt

864
00:55:21,165 --> 00:55:24,905
Speaker 2:  was like, at F1 race, this is like, this feels like a moment to me. Does

865
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:27,345
Speaker 2:  it feel like a moment to you? Like are you, are you watching this carefully?

866
00:55:27,495 --> 00:55:31,025
Speaker 11:  Certainly for Apple, it's definitely the biggest thing they've done and

867
00:55:31,295 --> 00:55:34,465
Speaker 11:  they partner with Warner Brothers for the release. Apple doesn't release

868
00:55:34,465 --> 00:55:37,745
Speaker 11:  their own movies in theaters. They partner with the traditional studios

869
00:55:37,745 --> 00:55:41,425
Speaker 11:  for that. And I, I think it, it's a big moment for them because

870
00:55:41,495 --> 00:55:44,985
Speaker 11:  it's kind of a make or break. I think if this is a total flop

871
00:55:45,325 --> 00:55:49,105
Speaker 11:  and they put all this effort and money into a movie for theaters that didn't

872
00:55:49,105 --> 00:55:53,025
Speaker 11:  really make a dent, I, I think they really question what

873
00:55:53,025 --> 00:55:56,905
Speaker 11:  they are doing in the theatrical space and that has

874
00:55:56,905 --> 00:56:00,745
Speaker 11:  repercussions all the way down the line. Having said that, Eddie Q was

875
00:56:00,745 --> 00:56:04,545
Speaker 11:  at the CinemaCon movie theater convention last week and he was

876
00:56:04,545 --> 00:56:08,265
Speaker 11:  doing meetings with the traditional theaters and he was at least saying,

877
00:56:08,445 --> 00:56:11,945
Speaker 11:  we care about theaters and we're gonna do some movies in theaters.

878
00:56:12,365 --> 00:56:16,065
Speaker 11:  So maybe they're committed to this, but I think if, if F1 flops,

879
00:56:16,065 --> 00:56:19,345
Speaker 11:  they're gonna really question it. I don't think it will. I think the movie

880
00:56:19,345 --> 00:56:22,385
Speaker 11:  looks good enough and I think that there will be an audience globally for

881
00:56:22,385 --> 00:56:26,205
Speaker 11:  this movie. So it, it may not be a billion dollar grocer, but I think it

882
00:56:26,205 --> 00:56:30,125
Speaker 11:  will do enough to, for them to feel like it was a success

883
00:56:30,265 --> 00:56:33,885
Speaker 11:  and that it was worth, it's worth doing for the right movie in the future.

884
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:36,885
Speaker 2:  All right, Matt, thank you so much. This was really fun. Appreciate you doing

885
00:56:36,885 --> 00:56:37,005
Speaker 2:  this.

886
00:56:37,005 --> 00:56:37,565
Speaker 11:  Yeah, no problem.

887
00:56:38,985 --> 00:56:41,565
Speaker 2:  All right, we gotta take one more break and then we're gonna come back and

888
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:43,845
Speaker 2:  take a question from The Vergecast hotline. We'll be right back.

889
00:58:43,275 --> 00:58:46,605
Speaker 16:  The Vergecast. I have a couple thoughts after your last episode.

890
00:58:47,205 --> 00:58:50,645
Speaker 16:  I wanted to ask about the Google Pixel. It seems like the Pixel has gone

891
00:58:51,155 --> 00:58:55,045
Speaker 16:  from being a, what is this phone going to even do in the

892
00:58:55,045 --> 00:58:58,165
Speaker 16:  future to a, this is what I recommend to my friends and family.

893
00:58:58,965 --> 00:59:01,905
Speaker 16:  Can you walk us through how that happened? Thanks.

894
00:59:02,975 --> 00:59:06,815
Speaker 2:  I really like this question because one of the reviews that I am frankly

895
00:59:06,885 --> 00:59:10,735
Speaker 2:  most proud of in retrospect, but was very skeptical

896
00:59:10,735 --> 00:59:14,575
Speaker 2:  of my own thoughts at the time were when I was at Wired and the very

897
00:59:14,575 --> 00:59:18,015
Speaker 2:  first pixel came out, I said it was the best phone on the planet period.

898
00:59:18,245 --> 00:59:22,165
Speaker 2:  Like not just best Android phone, best phone, because what we had been wanting

899
00:59:22,745 --> 00:59:26,645
Speaker 2:  was a phone that ran Android that didn't come with all the limitations

900
00:59:26,785 --> 00:59:30,245
Speaker 2:  of iOS and the iPhone and all of the closed wall

901
00:59:30,395 --> 00:59:34,235
Speaker 2:  gardens of it, but was simple and easy to

902
00:59:34,235 --> 00:59:37,795
Speaker 2:  use and just works and you didn't have to spend all your time like tweaking

903
00:59:37,795 --> 00:59:41,075
Speaker 2:  settings and installing launches and thinking about it. Something that just

904
00:59:41,655 --> 00:59:44,915
Speaker 2:  did all the things your phone was supposed to do. And the very first pixel

905
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:48,835
Speaker 2:  was very close to that. It wasn't perfect, but it was very close to that.

906
00:59:49,295 --> 00:59:53,115
Speaker 2:  And I think to me, the most fascinating thing about the Pixel line ever since

907
00:59:53,115 --> 00:59:56,345
Speaker 2:  then has been this weird

908
00:59:56,495 --> 00:59:59,945
Speaker 2:  rollercoaster of progress that it has made, right? I think

909
01:00:00,085 --> 01:00:04,065
Speaker 2:  Google has over the years gotten better at design. I think

910
01:00:04,065 --> 01:00:06,465
Speaker 2:  you, you, you can quibble with that a little bit, but the sort of Cyclops

911
01:00:06,465 --> 01:00:10,185
Speaker 2:  thing that happens on the pixels now I think looks nice. The cameras

912
01:00:10,295 --> 01:00:13,585
Speaker 2:  have consistently been very good and yet every time you turn around there

913
01:00:13,585 --> 01:00:17,505
Speaker 2:  is some weird thing going on with the pixels. This

914
01:00:17,505 --> 01:00:20,345
Speaker 2:  is what I mean by the rollercoaster. It's like it's sort of two steps forward

915
01:00:20,365 --> 01:00:23,545
Speaker 2:  and one step back with every one of these hardware iterations, there have

916
01:00:23,545 --> 01:00:27,265
Speaker 2:  been these mysterious hardware issues with a lot of them. My wife actually

917
01:00:27,265 --> 01:00:30,985
Speaker 2:  had one of these with a Pixel seven I believe it was, where

918
01:00:31,685 --> 01:00:35,305
Speaker 2:  her screen just went green, like matrixy green all of a sudden out of nowhere.

919
01:00:35,645 --> 01:00:37,985
Speaker 2:  And I looked it up online and tons of people were like, yeah, this happens.

920
01:00:37,985 --> 01:00:40,985
Speaker 2:  Google says it happens, they'll replace it. This is the kind of thing that

921
01:00:40,985 --> 01:00:44,785
Speaker 2:  is hard to engender real confidence. And

922
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:49,105
Speaker 2:  Google has had pretty rough customer support over the years. Its

923
01:00:49,465 --> 01:00:53,065
Speaker 2:  interest in the pixel lineup has kind of waxed and waned. It has had some

924
01:00:53,065 --> 01:00:56,545
Speaker 2:  issues with the tensor processors. There was one of the pixels where the

925
01:00:56,545 --> 01:00:59,425
Speaker 2:  fingerprint reader didn't work very well. Some of the phones have been really

926
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:03,425
Speaker 2:  sort of big and clunky. Google has just never quite put all

927
01:01:03,425 --> 01:01:07,385
Speaker 2:  the pieces together. But the thing it had going for it all this time

928
01:01:07,765 --> 01:01:11,505
Speaker 2:  is that it was the simple one, right? I think Samsung for most

929
01:01:11,565 --> 01:01:15,185
Speaker 2:  of its life in the Android world has been the default

930
01:01:15,295 --> 01:01:18,385
Speaker 2:  Android choice and with good reason, right? Samsung makes really good phones,

931
01:01:18,645 --> 01:01:22,465
Speaker 2:  it has really good interesting hardware, it has great cameras. It caught

932
01:01:22,465 --> 01:01:26,105
Speaker 2:  up a long time ago in a lot of those things and consistently does a very

933
01:01:26,105 --> 01:01:29,865
Speaker 2:  good job. But a Samsung phone is sort of by definition a power user

934
01:01:30,195 --> 01:01:33,625
Speaker 2:  thing and Samsung has still not done enough

935
01:01:34,285 --> 01:01:38,025
Speaker 2:  to pull back the operating system to make it so that you can

936
01:01:38,055 --> 01:01:41,905
Speaker 2:  just get a phone and have it and use it and it can just be

937
01:01:41,905 --> 01:01:44,985
Speaker 2:  your phone. I don't think most people wanna do work on their phones, right?

938
01:01:44,985 --> 01:01:48,585
Speaker 2:  And so I think for me and for Allison Johnson

939
01:01:48,765 --> 01:01:51,825
Speaker 2:  on our team and for a lot of our reviewers, the thing that we keep landing

940
01:01:51,885 --> 01:01:55,705
Speaker 2:  on is that simplicity is really important, right? And when I say like a

941
01:01:55,705 --> 01:01:59,105
Speaker 2:  Pixel nine A is a perfect phone for my parents, I mean that

942
01:01:59,335 --> 01:02:03,025
Speaker 2:  literally, right? Like I, I think there are lots of people who want to do

943
01:02:03,115 --> 01:02:05,945
Speaker 2:  stuff on their phone and they like mucking around in settings and I actually

944
01:02:05,945 --> 01:02:09,905
Speaker 2:  think Samsung deserves enormous credit for how much it lets you

945
01:02:09,905 --> 01:02:13,825
Speaker 2:  do on the phone. Samsung is just like a tinkerer's paradise

946
01:02:13,885 --> 01:02:17,865
Speaker 2:  of an Android device and should get real credit for that. But

947
01:02:19,125 --> 01:02:21,785
Speaker 2:  not everybody wants that. I think most people don't want that. And I think

948
01:02:21,815 --> 01:02:25,225
Speaker 2:  frankly, the reason Google started making pixels in the first place is that

949
01:02:25,225 --> 01:02:28,025
Speaker 2:  it understood that most people don't want that. Most people want a phone

950
01:02:28,025 --> 01:02:31,425
Speaker 2:  that they turn on that works and, and that is

951
01:02:31,845 --> 01:02:35,225
Speaker 2:  not a thing you get from most Android manufacturers. And so Google set out

952
01:02:35,225 --> 01:02:38,705
Speaker 2:  to say, okay, we think Android is really great. We think everybody is kind

953
01:02:38,705 --> 01:02:42,385
Speaker 2:  of bastardizing Android in the name of being interesting and

954
01:02:42,665 --> 01:02:45,745
Speaker 2:  customizable and trying new things and adding their own apps on top of our

955
01:02:45,985 --> 01:02:48,985
Speaker 2:  existing apps. And it was just too much. And so Google came in and said,

956
01:02:48,985 --> 01:02:52,025
Speaker 2:  okay, we're gonna pair all of that all the way back and we are going to give

957
01:02:52,025 --> 01:02:55,745
Speaker 2:  you the basic simple, straightforward,

958
01:02:56,215 --> 01:02:59,905
Speaker 2:  pure version of Android. And I think that was the right idea.

959
01:03:00,205 --> 01:03:04,145
Speaker 2:  And Android, you know, has also had its ups and downs. Android has had some

960
01:03:04,145 --> 01:03:08,065
Speaker 2:  weird ideas about like where apps go and how widgets

961
01:03:08,065 --> 01:03:11,345
Speaker 2:  work and all different kinds of settings, ideas. But I think at this point

962
01:03:11,345 --> 01:03:15,185
Speaker 2:  Android has landed in a really stable, really mature,

963
01:03:15,345 --> 01:03:19,025
Speaker 2:  really solid place and so has the pixel. I say this

964
01:03:19,415 --> 01:03:23,305
Speaker 2:  with real trepidation because frankly at any moment Google could just

965
01:03:23,305 --> 01:03:27,225
Speaker 2:  decide it doesn't care about this stuff anymore. And it has made grand

966
01:03:27,225 --> 01:03:30,585
Speaker 2:  promises about supporting these things for a long time that it has walked

967
01:03:30,585 --> 01:03:34,305
Speaker 2:  back in the past. Right now it's promises, seven years of security

968
01:03:34,305 --> 01:03:38,105
Speaker 2:  updates for its devices. That's a big deal and a big win. Am I

969
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:41,425
Speaker 2:  confident that Google is gonna wanna make smartphones in seven years? No,

970
01:03:41,885 --> 01:03:45,545
Speaker 2:  but if Google does wanna make smartphones in seven years, I think that's

971
01:03:45,545 --> 01:03:49,505
Speaker 2:  great. And so at the least I think we've landed on a place

972
01:03:49,505 --> 01:03:53,345
Speaker 2:  where you have two really great Android options and that's a

973
01:03:53,345 --> 01:03:57,305
Speaker 2:  victory. You have Samsung, which is like the power

974
01:03:57,335 --> 01:04:01,225
Speaker 2:  user lineup. It lets you do the most, It is the most capable, It is the most

975
01:04:01,355 --> 01:04:05,305
Speaker 2:  phone like in every imaginable way. And on the other hand you

976
01:04:05,305 --> 01:04:08,785
Speaker 2:  have the pixel, which is simple and straightforward. It is like the set it

977
01:04:08,785 --> 01:04:12,025
Speaker 2:  and forget it smartphone. And I think that's also very powerful and I think

978
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:16,305
Speaker 2:  different phones will work for different people. I think frankly

979
01:04:16,405 --> 01:04:19,505
Speaker 2:  I'm an iPhone user. I have been for a while. I'm terrified of leaving iMessage

980
01:04:19,505 --> 01:04:23,425
Speaker 2:  just to be completely honest. But that dichotomy I think is

981
01:04:23,425 --> 01:04:27,225
Speaker 2:  great. And I think the fact that the Apple lineup doesn't have that, where

982
01:04:27,225 --> 01:04:31,145
Speaker 2:  you get to choose between the one that just sort of works and you don't really

983
01:04:31,145 --> 01:04:34,505
Speaker 2:  have to think about and it's, it's simple and clean and nice

984
01:04:34,805 --> 01:04:38,225
Speaker 2:  versus the one that will just let me go in and muck around and have some

985
01:04:38,225 --> 01:04:41,585
Speaker 2:  fun. I love that about Android, I hate that about iOS.

986
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:44,545
Speaker 2:  But anyway, so that, that's where I've landed with the Pixel. I think the

987
01:04:44,545 --> 01:04:48,505
Speaker 2:  the Pixel and really sort of solidifying with the nine lineup last

988
01:04:48,505 --> 01:04:52,145
Speaker 2:  year and the nine A this year has landed at a point where like, I trust these

989
01:04:52,145 --> 01:04:55,865
Speaker 2:  phones, right? They're good. They don't have obviously huge

990
01:04:55,935 --> 01:04:59,105
Speaker 2:  glaring flaws. I don't have to tell you about the thing to watch out for.

991
01:04:59,655 --> 01:05:02,545
Speaker 2:  It's just a good phone and It is a good phone that I'm not going to have

992
01:05:02,545 --> 01:05:05,105
Speaker 2:  to spend hours teaching you how to use and that you're not gonna have to

993
01:05:05,105 --> 01:05:08,945
Speaker 2:  spend hours figuring out how to use and that's a victory and

994
01:05:08,945 --> 01:05:12,865
Speaker 2:  we need more of that in the tech industry. I say all this and

995
01:05:12,865 --> 01:05:16,665
Speaker 2:  you know, give it three days and Google will cancel the next pixel

996
01:05:16,805 --> 01:05:20,525
Speaker 2:  and everything will be set. But until then I'm gonna keep recommending the

997
01:05:20,525 --> 01:05:24,085
Speaker 2:  Pixel to a lot of people because I continue to think it might just be the

998
01:05:24,085 --> 01:05:24,725
Speaker 2:  best phone out there.

999
01:05:26,435 --> 01:05:29,565
Speaker 2:  Alright, that is it for The Vergecast today. Thank you to everybody who came

1000
01:05:29,565 --> 01:05:32,405
Speaker 2:  on the show and thank you as always for listening. Thank you. By the way,

1001
01:05:32,405 --> 01:05:36,205
Speaker 2:  to everybody who voted for us in the Webby Awards, we're gonna know on,

1002
01:05:36,705 --> 01:05:40,605
Speaker 2:  oh today, Tuesday the 22nd. Whether we won or not, we will tell
